      <field name="fulltext">A Metrical History of Christianity Square brackets denote editorial insertions or emendations. Now in the nasty ? Glory The Glorious ? of Heaven ? In our Blessd King of Grace ? A Sacrifice for Sin, a Price for those That he Redeems, and shall to glory come And for himself and Cause his Martyredome. He having Pitcht and raist the Standard up The thirty fift yeare fills this golden Cup Handed down first by Jews, Jerusalem To Deacon Stephen martyred first by them Who mightily assisted by Christ['s] Spirit Did them Confound hence must as Heir inherit This Crown of Glory first: Hence on him fall A Shoure of Stones they Cast at him to mall His Brains out in a rage. Who as he dide Begd Pardon for them: nay and testifide He saw the Heaven open wide to stand And Christ in Glory sit at Gods right hand, And on that day another Deacon namde Nicanor martyredom for Christ sustaind And (as Dorotheus saith) two thousand more Went off this stage then on the selfe same soore. About the forty sixt yeare Christ out thrust The golden Cup that James th'Apostle must Drink of as he had promisde him before He should drinke of. He drinks it up therefore He's martyride now by Herods Sword Who when He was Condemn'd, the man that led him then Unto his bloody judge beholding all Professt himself a Christian, Hence did fall Under that Sentence, as its said, and so Cravde Pardon now of James as he did go To execution with him. Wherefore hee After a pause upon't, Peace be to thee Brother, said James and kisst him so in Love They fell by Herods Sword: and went above. Simon another of the Deacon lay Burnt was at Bostrum in Arabia Parmenas too another of them still They on this Quarrell too his blood did spill Th'Apostle Thomas after he had Taught Medes, Persians, Parthians, Germans and had brought Christ to the Bactrian Hircaconians and The Magians till his grace they understand The Wicked Jews did in Judea kill At Calamina with a dart (oh! skill) The Jews stone and behead Mathias, nay Some say he died in Ethiopia ? the Crown ? glory ?nown ? sparkling Pearles the head Of James the Just Who with Celestiall Bread Did Feed and Govern well Christs Holy Flock In thee Jerusalem sacred: now they knock Him headlong down off from the Temples roofe And brain him with a Fullers Club for th'truth And for this Fact Josephus thought Gods ire Destroyd the City by the Roman fire. The Jews thus driving Christ out of their Coast Do strive and with their malice ferment most Against him ery where and blow the fire In other Quarters t'make this Cause expire. Simon Zelotes having Preacht Christ name In Affrica, also in Mauritaine And Britane too was took and Crucifide Thus wining of a Martyres Crown he dide. Judas the brother too of James was slain At Berito when he had spread Christs fame. Matthew the Gospell wrote with Hebrew Tongue And did it preach the Ethiops among, Was slain amongst them by the Kings Command Run through there with a Sword. Oh! wicked hand. Bartholomew the Indians did respect Preacht Christ to them, and in their Dialect Turnd Mathews Gospell. In Armenia Was beaten sore with Cudgells: and they say Was Crucifide and fleyde alive, and then Beheaded too. Oh! monstrous wicked men. They of Hierapolis in Phrygia Th'Apostle Philip who did Christ display To Barbarous nations Crucifide, and stond To death, and there lie his and Daughters bones. Andrew th'Apostle preaching Christ unto The Scythians, Sogdians, Saxons, and also In Angust was by Egeas Crucifide At Patris in Achaia. So he dide. Antipas martyrde was at Pergamus Where he as Christ declared hath to us A holy martyre was. But how none shew. Some think that Esculapi's gang him slew. Nero that bloody man begins his reign Who doth with martyres blood his life bestain. Those persecution enter now wherein (Jerom to Heliodor doth write the thing) No day but January Calends in the year More than five thousands martyres martyrde were. This monster Nero having took offence At Simon Peter, whom he saw dispense Christs ? Of Simon Magus and his ? ery Made Nero's Lifeguard, who when tha? would Not raise up Nero's Kinsman dead; behold He raised was by Peter in Christs name Hence Simons Deity attracting shame He from the capitoll in open Sight Betook himselfe unto his wings, and flight. But Peters Prayers against his Witcheries Him with a vengeance brought down from the Skies That by the fall he brake his legs and dide. Hence Peter is by Nero Crucifide, And with his head down as unworthy so To be as Christ. His wife was then also About the Seventi'th yeare and now at Rome Paul is beheaded too; at Nero's doom. And by this Lions jaws were others Crusht As Veticine, Vitalis Process just Martinian, Gervas, Peotasius Nazar, Porpetas Felix Torquatus Celsus, Cecilius Euphrasius Estius, Apuleius, and Marcellus And Constance with these Virgins, Erasina And Thecla too of whom strange things they tell. And more than sum'd can be by Nero fell. The second Persecuting Rage began Domitian vile, a bloody monstrous man Who would be deifide and worshipt would His Image in the Capitoll of Gold And Silver, slew all Judah's males for feare Lest Davids Kingdom promisd up appeare His Cruell rage against Christ sheep did smite Down Dionass the Areopagite In th'ninety sixt yeare. And about this time At Ephesus they took first John th'Divine And cast him in a Tun of boiling Oyle Who coming thence without all harm did foile Their skill of torture. Then to banishment He into Patmos desert isle is sent. And there the Revelations doth Receive Which Christ by him doth with his Churches leave. Nereus and Achilles now obtaind A Crown of Martyredome for truth mentain'd [Missing Title] This Holy Blood Cries out: doth thus Complain: Where art thou Justice? Hast no Eyes or Hands? Or art thou leaden heeld? or sick or lame? Are not these bloody ones fit for thy bands? Shine, shine forth Justice. Make these tyrants feele Thou hast an Iron hand though leaden heel. Hence Herod in his Chains Comes to the Bench Those Babes Whose blood, and in whose blood Christs blood He is embrew'd do meet him now and drench Him with the Cup he filld with it. Is it good? Nay Antipater both his Son and heir A Cup of Poyson did for him prepare. But God goes on and Justice doth thus smite Him with a Slow and burning Fire that makes His bowells rot, a greedy Apetite, Worms eating him alive, sore Belly akes A nasty Priapism doth abound In him, and he doth stinck above the ground. An instance he's of sparkling Justice shown Oh! Wretched man! and yet in this sad state All Judah Nobles in the Hippodrome He pend up to be butcher'd at his Fate Lest at his Death griefe should not drown the Land The Nobles all must dy by his Command. Soon after paring of an apple, hee Had stabd himselfe had not hee hindred bin. Whilst hearing his supposed Death brought glee To Antipater he did butcher him And five dayes after in a Wretched guise Death Cites his soule to Come to Christs assize. Now Archilaus, Herod, Philip, Cubs Of this Curst Sire, like Curs on Carrion fall Upon the Kingdom whom by Will he dubs His Heirs, and Archilaus reigns withall. He findes the Kingdom soon about his eares: Untill he's banish't quite for his arreares. And Herod, who his brother Philip wipes Clean of his Wife (Strange litter of th'old Hound) Takes of John Baptists head: but marke the Stripes Which for a Close he over took him found. He is dethron'de and banisht into France With his Herodias, and her that Danct. The Scourge doth pass to Pontius ? He is accusd, took and to Rome is sent His Case is heard by Cesar and moreo're Hee is Condemn'd and suffers banishment Exiled thus to Lions where he layes Upon himself his hands, himselfe there slayes. Then Herod James his slaughter who designd To butcher Peter Comes to tax apace For all his Rhetorick and Robes that shind And Deity could not his doom deface. An Angell smites him down. Worms eate him do While yet alive. His ghost goes from him so. The Stage in Judah is not quitted yet The Jews for slaying Jesus must now smart: Vengeance doth take their track and follow it. With fearfull Scourges which she doth impart. Their Temples made an Idoll. Temple and Caligula's new Godhead there must stand. This new found god they do disgust and rise Up to displace. Where at they down are knockt Like butcherd Calves, and on go mutinies Till like a shambles all the land is stockt Justice doth follow at their heeles untill She by their blood hath Cancelled her bill. Their towns begirt by Siegers till their Walls Do tumble down their streets made streams of blood Their houses filld with Famine. Women fall Rosting their babes, bake, boyle them too for food This was thy Cup, Jerusalem, Gods ire Did burn thee and thy temple up with fire. 'Bout seventy three years from Christs birth were slain Leven hundred thousands of thy Children, hence And seventeen thousand more were Captives tai'n And sold good Cheap, thirty for thirty pence. Two thousand Titus led in tryumph who Were some to pieces hackt, some to wild beasts goe. Alas Jerusalem; this is thy Case Thou Justice didst compell this way to shine Because thou didst reject all Gospell Grace And Crucify thy Onely Lord Divine Those that reject the Gospell Grace shall finde The Sword of Justice is for them design'd. ? this ship is brought into the Coast For when Tiberius would have deifide Christ in thee, then he Could not rule the rost Thy Senators, and Nobles Christ denide. And though he had no saving Faith yet they Rejected Christ and Justice brings their pay. Tiberius a tyrant now becomes Doth plague his Nobles, and a Scourge doth lay Upon his Counsilours, his fiercness sums Its rage up and doth eighteen of them slay And hence the history doth thus complain There was no day wherein no man was slain. But after him Caligula who rather Wisht all the folk of Rome had but one neck That he might neck them all at once together He murderd whom he pleased at his beck. He'd be a god and honour have Divine Hence fills all Temples with his cursed Shrine. He in his Chest did keep two Bills this stylde His Sword the one, the other Dagger namde. Wherein their names he ment to slay were filde Glasst Poysons ranck his Coffers lockt containd Which being cast into the sea the thing Did Fishes poyson much that swam therein. But when this bloody man was slain and fell, And Claudius Nero wore the Palmy Crown His Cruell hand did still ring Justice's bell Against their Nobles who fell by his frown His Tyranny did rage untill the day That Justice by her hand him took away. Domitius then that Tyrant coming in The Prodigy of monstrous Villany Did make the Senates blood all Rome ore swim, Them almost but their knites did all destroy. His Mother and his Sister he defilde Then slew them, and did kill his wife with Child. He fisht with nets of Gold and Purple made His Mules were shod with Silver Shooes, oh brave He set Rome too afire meanwhile he playde The Burning Troy. These flames did seven day rave The second persecution by his Laws He raisd against Christs flock, Charg'd with this Cause. But Justice now delayes no longer. She Doth move the Senate bravely to proclaim Him foe to mankind, therefore drawn must bee Through Rome, and scourgd to Death a Death of shame. Which hee to shun doth take his Dagger and Bebutchereth himselfe with his vile hand. Wonders To Put out Claudius' Eyes a Comet Came And 'fore his death, it raines down blood and Flame On the Pretorian Souldiers Colours slide From Heaven and Joves Temple opens wide. At Nero's Table Lightning sits as Guest And eats up all his Supper for him dresst. The Earth too opes her mouth in Asia And swollows up Leodicea, nay Hierapolis with Coloss too which must Cover their farings up under her dust A fearfull Sight! Shall towns be buride quick O! Greedy gut: is this an honest trick? It raind in Alban now much blood to dy The Rivers red. The Seas now backwards fly From Egypt And Lycia much ore'flow Seekes out new Tents and doth its old foregoe. What excrements didst thou oh Cyprus poure When thy wide Jaws did thy three towns devour. In year the first wherein Vespation reignd And in his second yeare the Plague obtaind Its pleasure so in Rome that many dayes Then every day it its ten thousand slayes. The Eruption of the Vasuvian flames in Campania about the yeare of Christ 81. The Mount Vasuvius in Campany Facing towards thee, Naples, on the Sea Is wont to spit greate flake of burning fire Out of its mouth on e'ry side round by her: This once each yeare; she did But now behold In Autumn when Titus the sword did hold Evin of his second yeare its Tops belcht out Such horrid flames, tremendous round about The intrails burnt to ashes but the Skin Remains unsinged and so at the brim Like to an Amphitheater in frame Belching out Smoake by day, by night much flame Wherein Perfumes of ev'ry kinde do seem To be Effected, which these Vapours teem. It Puffs out dust when things therein do fall And whirls out Stones with violence, doth gall And more anoyes and bellowing like Bulls Yea now a mighty number (Oh it Skulls) Of men of an unusuall life like to The feigned Gyants, in this mountain show And in the bordering Coasts and neighbour towns By night and day to wander up and down And do appeare to wander in the Aire Then after follows mighty draught most rare And grievious Earth Quakes: all that plain grew warm The mountains tops fell in and wonders swarm. Then subterraneous sounds our ears did lull Like Thunder, and on Earth lowings like bulls. Then seas did rage, all heaven ore rings, a Crash Rose great and sudden as if all mountains Clash Then immense stones out first did leape unto The Highest tops and a greate plenty loe Of Fire and Smoke out brake, which did in Summ Obscure the Aire and hide the very Sun. Night then was made of Day, Darkness of Light, Gyants among themselves (some deem'd) did fight Because their Shapes did in this Smoke appeare And 'cause they did the sound of Trumpets heare And others thought the World itselfe would turn Into a Chaos or in th'fire should burn. Hence out of houses to the wayes some high, Some from the wayes into their houses fly. Some from the Sea run to the land, and then Run from the Land unto the Sea again. Some all Disturbd hope things that are to come More safe will be than present things do run. Such mighty Store of Ashes rose that still The land and Sea and very Aire they fill Nay and they flew quite o're the Sea away To Affrick, Egypt, and to Syria And brought greate dammage both to beast and men, But killd the fish and fowles yea all of them. Two Cities calld Pompy and Herculane With all their host receav'd a totall bane And they in Rome for some dayes after th'ill Not knowing of the reason of this still Deemd all things would to topsy turvy run Earth get to heaven and to the Earth the Sun. And when the following yeare Titus did go Into Campania to se this Woe A mighty Conflagration up at Rome Rose out of th'Earth and much did then Consume. The Chappells, Septs, and Temple up araisd For Serapis, Isis, and Neptune praisd, The Agrippine sa ? The Balkine States Pommpeian Scene in Glory Th'Octavian Edifices with brave bookes The Temple of greate Jupiter that looks After the Capitoll, with th'Temples neer Consumed by this Conflagration were. Rome Rome looke to't: God will his Glory save Slight Grace and Justice will her penworths have. The second Century of years from Christs birth. Graces bright Shine. Oh! Glorious Day of Glorious Light! Guilded with Grace that shines most bright Than any Pen, and Ink can write Thy Beams out shine. Bringing thy Holy Servant John From Patmos Ile, Where that Vile one Had banisht him: yet here upon He's made Divine. How should I choose but make my Feet Ware Sapphick Slippers when this sweet And Glorious Grace breaks forth to greet Us with such gales? Whose Golden Pen so cleare doth write Those Glorious Visions that did light Before his Eyes in open Sight That't us assails. How came he thence thus in his hands Holding those Letters Christ Commands Be gi'n to th'Candlesticks that stand Made all of gold And clearly 'fore our eyes doth fix How middst these golden Candlesticks Christs walking doth his glory mix And Shines unfold? How his Right hand doth hold these Stars? These shining Lights? These Trumpiters? Angells of Peace and Gospell wars: 'Gainst Hellish Hosts? Doth Chide for Sin, Doth Call to Grace, Doth Threaten, yet Shines fill his Face With Promises doth us imbrace Draws to his Coasts. Whose golden Pen doth Still describe How he Christs Court in Heaven spide When heavens Gate op'to him Wide, Whose Throne was lac'de With a Smaregdine Rainbow rounde, Where in a glorious One he found Like to a Sardine Jasper sound His lookes were grac'te, And round about this Throne of State The Courtiers, Saints and Angells waite Saints Glorifide Crown's with rich Plate Yea Crowns of Gold, And clothed in White Robes pure, trim, On foure and twenty seats sitting Christs Officers within the Rim The Throne doth hold. Before it stand Christs Angels bright Sparkling like Lamps of firy light And all the Works Worke of Delight With blissfull noyse The matters that transacted were In this Bright Court of Glory Cleare Were bravely done, yet to the eare In Dreadfull wise. And in the Throned Persons hand A seald Book was none understand, Untill the Seals were opend and Pluckt off the same. At which the Courtiers sang forth praise On Viols, Harps, and other wayes Which with their Incense they araise To spread Christs fame. And in the opening each Seale He doth Gods Providence reveale Unto his Church, both Woe and Weale Of Pagan Rome. Yea till she Antichrist doth rise And play the Rex in Cruilties Untill the Glorious one Destroyes Her by his Doom. And now he also shews ag'en The Heavens send Jerusalem New like a bride adornd down then Heart Ravishingly. And that the Wicked then shall goe Into the firy Lake of Woe Where mercies stream doth never flow Nor grain of joy. How Glorious Saints, With Angells harp These blissfull songs of Praise which starte Forth Warblingly as glorious sparks Of Honour Coild All up in a bright thankfull Theame And isshue like a living Streame From Souls bathd all in glories gleame And nothing soild. As in this City stately known Walld all with sparkling Pretious Stone Whose Gates are Pretious Pearles, each one, And streets pure gold They get and eate the Fruites that grow Upon the Tree of Life also Within Gods Paradise whence flow Joyes manifold. Thus John came from his Patmos Ile With this bright Glory thus to foile The Evills of the times that spoile The Gospell shine And with these Glorious brightsome beames To Counter buff all Darkining streames While this Discoverie outgleams Things such, Divine Still a Prophetick Spirit doth Attend the Gospell as it go'th And wondrous things it often shew'th To win poore hearts. Hence Gospell Grace doth much assaile The Pagan World, and doth prevaile Conversion worke hence doth not faile But fills all parts. Saints rising up in Churchood fix, Encrease the Golden Candlesticks, The Gospell Sun hath no Ecclipse As yet, Oh Praise. Their Officers like Angells shine Or like the Stars in glories line And flame forth Rayes of Light Divine In holy Wayes. Christs sparkling Image bright forth shines Through these Choice Persons Lives and Lines Which they receiv'd from such Devines As went before. Both ministers of Gods rich Grace And other Saints that had a place In Gospell Causes truth to trace Whereof are store. Asian Saints of the Century. Th'Apostle John doth lead the Van With Silver hairs adorn'd, Good Man And Crownd with Grace, from whom out ran A glory Bright, Spreading its guilding beams all ore The Asian Quarters further more Sending a Shine from Shore to Shore Of Saving Light. Now in Jerusalem shone cleare For after Symeon Martyr'd there Justus did in that Church appeare Of Whom its said He was the third that did arise To Preach the Gospell Mysteries Which savingly before their eyes He forth displaid. Then Zachy, Toby, Benjamin, John, Matthy, Phillip, they in bring Senica, Justus, Levi spring With Ephrem there, Joseph, and Judas too who taught The gospell truth but yet are thought All of the Circumcision fraught Yet godly were. And now Jerusalem destroyde The Jews must there no more abide Marke with a gentile Church their slide Oh Shining Grace. Now Jewish Rites do therein Cease The Circumcision out of lease A Gospell Gentile Church in peace Doth there take place. And after Marke there follows thus Casianus, Publy, Maximus, Julianus, Gajan, Symnachus, And Cajus then, A second Julian, Capito, Maximus, Antoninus so, Valens, Dolychianus, too, Choice pious men. Then came Narcissus, Elius, Germanio, and Gordius, Narcissus then again and thus Christs truth mentaine. These Holy ministers of Grace Successively all in one place And beare the Scepter, and the Mace Thus of Christs Name. In Antioch this Shine did rise From Holy men of various Sise Ignatius, as our Histories But two or three From Peter rose, who had Converse With such as Learning did Rehearse From John and others, did disperse The Same we see Then rose Cornelius, Eros, thus Then Antioch's Theophilus Then Maximinus sin to crush, Serapio. In Hierapolis likewise When the Apostles closd their eyes Soon Holy Papias did rise And Grace forth show. At Smyrna rose that bright bright Star, Old Polycarp Christs Harbinger And Johns Choice Scholar, making war Against all Sin. A Pious Orthodox Divine Who in his martyring fire did shine Like Polisht Silver at that time Grace shone in him. In Sardis Church that glorious Light Choice Melito shining out bright Who an Apology did Write To Antonine Who persecution up araisd Against the Lord, the Lord be praisd For such bright Lights that out thus blaizd That thus do shine. The Affrican Saints of this time Again Grace doth in Affrica Her shining beams abroad display Through her Choice ones whereof wee'l lay Some few down here. In Alexandria Cerdo rose The third from Mark, then Justus shows, Eumenes, then Pontonus flows With Learning cleare. Then Clemens Alexandrine brings His Pious Learning forth, this springs. Crete still did shine with Gracious things Of Holiness. Amongst whom shone these shining lights Phillipus and Pinyt, Delights To such as hate all Dismall Sprites Of Sinfulness. Some European Saints of these dayes. And in the Churches that did spring In Europe Grace her Beams did bring In glorious wise, which darting fling Out Balls of Light At Athens Publius displayes Christs Banner who liv'd in those dayes Wherein Vile men afflictions raise By Wicked spite. Then follows brave Quadratus there Who'd seen some that from death raisd were By Christ himselfe a Pillar here Of glorious Fame And after him there up arose Good Aristides to disclose Christs Grace to them, in spite of foes, And blessed Name. At Corinth, Primus, Denyse and Bacchilides: at Lystra stand Up Quirine, and followd out of hand Eleuthery. At Rome also there shining is, Choice Clemens Pauls Companion yes And many Choice ones sit for bliss By Piety. Here Egesippus now steps in And springs of Piety and spring Of this Choice one for Christ our king Whose Cause he pleads. Now Justine Martyre doth not feare With strong Apologies t'appeare Before the Tyrant for our Deare Choice Lord who lead's. Christs gracious Beams shine forth in France Though such that in Church State advance His Cause, at Lions Vien lance Out in this main. Photicus here shews Piety And Ireneus learnedly By Polycarpe taught vertuously Here Christ proclaim. Such Scutch'ons now hang forth of Grace Christians abound in e'ry place And armed souldiers it imbrace, Its beams out fly. Hence springs the shine of Holiness And Piety becomes their dress With powerfull Prayre that in distress They sent on high. Mark Antonine doth witness this Whose army grew for thirst remiss And weake against those foes of his Quades, Vandalls, and Sarmatians in a streight place where With five dayes thirst they stressed were Thought now at brink of ruine were They could not stand This Legion then calld Melitine All Christians, fell thus at that time Down on their knees, and prayde, in fine God tapt the Cloudes. Drew for the Army drinke also Out of His Firkins, and did throw Darts firy i'th' face of the foe That brake their Shroudes. The Foes amaizd, away do fly, Markes Army 'fresht gain Victory Are filled with tryumphant Joy, This Legion call The Thundering Legion. Thus through Grace Their Powerfull Prayres in such a Case Prevaild: which as a Glass wee place Of Grace 'fore all. The Exercise of Gods Patience. But now the Glory of Gods Patience may As in a Looking Glass before us play Wherein we may observe its Exercise By Heresy and Tyranny arise The which my Pen in a more sable style According to the theme laments a While. Hereticks or Heresies. The new God Simon breaking of Legs These Evill Birds were hatched of his eggs Menander who professt himselfe that hee The Power of God and Saviour too to mee That they should never die he did baptize Beguiling men by his Vile Witcheries Then Saturnine who through his monstrous evill Taught Marriage and increase was of the Divell, Basilides, who did deny Christ dide Might when in Persecution be denide. Then Carporcrates who did glory in Vile Spells, and sociate spirits, did begin. The Images of Jesus ? Pythagoras and Plato to adore He did deny the Resurrection day, As Epiphanius and Augustine say These all were hatcht in Simon Magus' nest With his penfeather'd Errours were possest. Now Ebion, who of another sise Doth set abroach his Hogshead too of lies Affirms that Christ was but a man as wee Denieth Pauls' Epistles, saith we bee Not Justifide by Faith alone, must use The Jewish Laws, and Sabbath of the Jews. And Symmachus that into Greek did write The Hebrew Bible, was an Ebeonite. The Gnosticks broode of Valentinians Sweld up with pride above the Ebions: Of Christ they say he was not born indeed; But say he of the Divell did proceed: Curst Blasphemy; and yet they do profess All knowledge have and women do possess In common. Oh, What Vilanies are here? To heare these things may raise a trembling feare. The Ophites were a sort of Hereticks That Serpents worship (Oh! the hellish tricks!) They say the Serpent that did man deceive Was Christ, which from the Gnosticks they receive. The Nazareans who did Christ Godhead own Profess the Law the onely rule made known. Marcion whose father him for wickedness Cast out of Churchhood, vily did profess, That th'Old and the New Scriptures disagree That Christ went down to hell and did set free Cain, Sodomites, and the Egyptians sad, That there was three Beginers, Good, Just, Bad, That there should be no Resurrection day, Unto the Body that was made of Clay. Cerdon of Syria taught, That God Christs Father Was not the God of th'Law, nor Prophets neither. He the Old Testament also denide: And from the reserrection did backslide. The Valentinian Errour of renown Saith Christ his body brought from Heaven down, Which passed through the Virgin Mary like As Water passeth through a Conduit pipe. The Montanists did in the Phrygian Coast Profess Montanus was the Holy Ghost: And Maximilla and Priscilla were His Bagages to make the same appeare. He marriage did forbid, and also treates Commanding to abstain from certain meates. They prickt a boy with Bodkins till blood went Out where they bake bread for their Sacrament. And if he die he's martyre Canoniz'd If live, he's made a greate Priest highly prizd. Then the Heracleonites do Sacrifice With Witchcrafts and deny Christ miseries Or sufferings, the Resurrection too; Such villanies they blush not at to show. And Tatianus hatcht the Encratites, Forbids to marry, also doth invite's From use of Living Creatures, and did choose Water for Sacramentall wine to use. Pepuzian Hereticks make women rise Priests as the Montanists, to sacrifice. Artorytites did in the Sacrament Use bread and Cheese, when unto it they went. Th'Alogians say that Christ was not the Word: And do deny Johns Gospell as absurd. Netus denide three Persons, did profess Father, Son, Spirit sufferd in the Flesh. These Heresies thus namd and other such Did Exercise Gods Patience very much. Tyrannies. When Cesars race had sufferd its last Fate In Nero, when there di'de the Laureate And Nerva after sixteen months did leave To Trajans Crown the rich Imperiall Wreath, The hundreth yeare from Christ he dipt his Bayes In Martyres Blood; third Persecution raisd And did so rage in Cruelty whereby There thousands daly fell most Cruelly. This fire burnt up in Asia these then Old Simeon Clophas at Jerusalem Whom they though sixscore years of age he'd gaind Scourgd many dayes, Death on the Cross sustaind. Cleophus too sustains this Cruell rage And as a martyre now goes of the Stage. Now Sagaris obtains this blessed Crown. At Antioch five virgins with renown Were for the Faith to ashes burnt, whose bones Were powder'd small then into vessells thrown And usd to wash with. And these tyrants throw Into a Lime kiln hot first, then into A scalding Bathe, that worthy bishop nam'd Phocas of Pontus, thus the Crown he gain'd. Marke the Evangelist was drawn its said By ropes in Egypt to the fire there made, And burnd, then buri'd in the Bucolus, But some deny't, and say he dide not thus. Now Domicilla that Choice Lady glisters Was Daughter of Domitian Cesar's sister Converted too by Peters Scholars who Because she would not married bee unto Clemens Domitians brothers son was sent To Pontia ile for Christ in banishment. But now at last is burned in her bed Yea and her Servants Welcome banished. 111This Cup is drunke at Rome. Sulpitius Servilianus Romans also rush With Euphrosina and Theodora Their Wives into the Sorrows of their day. Ignatius now of Antioch, by some Held next to Peter there thus out must come To be devour'd at Rome by Wild beasts, who Confirmd the Asian Flocks as he did goe Charging them to take heed of Heresy, And coming unto Smyrna there whereby He Polycarp did visit, and wrote thus A letter to the Church of Ephesus: Onefimus being their Pastor then Letters to others as he went did pen. Wherein he thus enflames to Martyredome, From Syria, saith he, untill I come To Rome I fought with beasts as well by Sea As Land as well: both in the night and day, Bound fast among ten Libbards, whom I finde Worse so much to me as I'm to them kinde. Would God I were come to the Beasts which be With claws prepar'd, provoked to worry mee. Oh Pardon me, prayer I now begin To be a true Disciple by this thing. Things seen or Unseen I regard not so I may obtain Christ Jesus: Weale or Woe, Fire, Gallows, Wild Beast-knawings, Crashing Bones, Tareing my members off, Weights on me thrown To press my body, torments, Divells bring On Hell itselfe, may I Christ Jesus win. And when Condemn'd he heard the Lions roare, I am, said he, Christ's Wheate and shall therefore As by a mill by wild beasts teeth be ground That I fine mansient Bread may thus be found. This Tragedy in Trajans 'Leventh yeare Was acted as by histories appeare And Publius Bishop, at Athens falls By this sad Persecution, as Christ calls. This Persecution ragde to's fourteenth yeare Wherein amazed Pliny did appeare To intercede, gave Trajan t'understand They upright were that fell by this sad hand Onely they Worshipt Christ. Hence Trajan staid This Persecution that such Works had made. Persecution under Adrian Th'Imperiall Mitre tottering fell down. Off Trajans Head hopt up on Adrians Crown. 120About the six scorth yeare of Christ he soon A Persecuting Course did up resume. In's second yeare he doth the Prison stow With Alexander, bishop, and doth throw Hermes the City-Prefect with his Wife Children and Family, in prison rife, Twelve hundred, yes, and fifty sumd; thus cast And burnt in firy furnace them at last: Which fact Theodulus reproved who was Then Deacon of the Church, for which, alas! He and Eventius, a Deacon too, And others tast the selfe same sawce, and rue. Zeno a Noble man of Rome thus he Ten thousand more and ten score yea and three Were on the count of Christs most righteous Cause To Execution led by those vile Laws. And in the fift year when Eustachius wise Whom he had sent against his Enemies Having them Conquourd quite returning home, This Adrian did Joyously out come To meet, and would thank offer'ngs for the same Unto Apollo give and would Constrain Did urge Eustachius to do so too Which when he would not, he was sure to rue And therefore when he comes to Rome he shall Be sacrificed, slain, Wife and Children all. His tenth yeare's said to slay ten thousand more Upon mount Ararat, on Christ rich score, Whereof Achaicus was Chiefe, also Heliades, Carcerica do goe For Captains and Theodorus its said The master of the Souldiers was made. And when the tenth yeare of this Tyrant come Faustina and Jobita martyredom Sustain in Brixia; and he then did slay Eleathery the Bishop, Anthia His mother both, who were beheaded loe In Apuleia and Sophia too With her three Children, and Seraphia And Symphorisia, with seven children, yea Sabina too di'de by this tyranny, Because they walkt in Christian piety Justus, and Pastor hanged were in Spain At Complute for the sake of Christs Choice name. But now God graciously attends the Prayre Of his Choice ones, and grants them other fare. When Adrian at Athens was and gave Men leave as list to persecute and rave That brave Disciple of th'Apostles there Quadratus, Athens Bishop did appeare, Gave Adrian a learnd Apology And bravely pend for Christianity, Prooved without cause they did the Christians damn, Shewing himself indeed a Right square man. Then Aristide, Philosopher of fame Chiefe seeing man according to his name The Muses Treasury, and hord of Wit A Magazeen of Wealthy Rhetorick The Cream of Athens did with Eloquence Before him lay for them a Learnd Defenco. Also Serenus Granius a man Of greate Nobility to Adrian Wrote Pithy Letters, gravely proving how No Right or Reason can this thing allow That blood of Innocents be given to The rage of people, and Condemned so Without all fault, but for a Name, and Sect. Which brave Apologies had good effect, For Adrian forthwith charg'd by Letters sent, Menuce Fundanus Asia's President To sentence none without full proofe of Crime, And hence the Church enjoy'd a peacefull time. 140Now Adrian about the sevenscore yeare Slipt from his Royall Wreath; Emperiall Chaire, And Antoninus Pius wore the same For more than twenty years his pleasant reign But yet those troubles Adrian broached drop And many Choice Saints sadly off do crop. At Alexandria Ptolomy dies And Lucius too for Christ in Sacrifice. At Rome Felicitas with Children seven In this Curst rage dispatched are for heaven, One slain with plumbed Darts, one from on high Thrown headlong down, two others made to dy By Clubs, and then the other three down fall Beheaded before her Eyes, then she ends all. Concordius now falls in Spoleto slain There by the Sword who did Christs truth mentain. In France Photinus Lions Bishop, nay With forty nine there prisond, made away, And else where many more till Antonine Better inform'd did draw another line. Hence peace is granted for a little space Unto Christs Flock for which they sing him grace. The Persecution under Mark Antonine Mark Antonine getting upon his pate Th'Imperiall Trinket, Royall Laureate Doth point his sparkling sword in Holy blood Drawn from the Saints, Phlebotomizd, aflood. In Asia first this Cruell game is plaid And Philodelphs twelve Champion brave assai'de, They did with hellish Cruelties untill Their scourging Whips according to their Will Their inward Veans and Arteries make appear Their intrails bowells, members too seen were, Then set them on sharp Shells, Edgd, Nails, and Thorns To go upon, then thrown to beasts with scorns. Germanicus behavde himself herein Most Christianly, with patient suffering And those that came at this sad sight to gaize Were smit hereby and put into a maize. Old Polycarp an Apostolick man Johns Choice Disciple, Smyrna's Light began To fill this rage he's apprehended, ta'ne And entring in the judgment place, there came A Voice from heaven heard by many there That said, Oh Polycarp, be of good Cheere, And play the man, Then urgd Christ to deny, I've eighty six years serv'd him, did reply He never hurt me, how then shall I fling Ill speech against my Sovereign Lord, and King: Being threatined if he took no better way To be unto the Wild beasts thrown, did say Then bring them we resolve repentance shall Not from the better to the worst of all Convay us. Then being threat'ned the fire, He said thou threatenest us with fire in ire But knowst not the Fire of Everlasting doom That is reserved the Wicked to Consume, Then to the Pile he goes but yet denay'd To be their naild, and when he had then pray'd, The fire was kindled, and the flames did rage And unto Wonder like a Valted Stage Or Sayle filld up with winde about him who Lay in the midst not burnt, but shone like to Refined Gold and Silver, and there rose A sweet perfume like Myrrh and touched those That did him tend: at last they thrust him through And end him with a Sword: hence blood doth flow And quench the fire. Then was the Enemy Amazd to see how bravely Christians dy. This furious rage like to a boiling pot Did wallop ore in Europe far more hot. Some say those mentioned in Pius rain Did martyredom under this Marke sustain. Now Justine Martyre that Philosopher That did present to Mark this Emperor, And to the Senate grave Apologies For Christian Faith, a blessed Martyre dies. France feels the fury of this Hellish flame, It unto Lions and Vienna came Where Christs meeke flock did patiently endure What e're the frantick rage of folk procures As Railings, Draggings, Haulings, Stone flingings, Scourgings, Imprisonings, and such sad things. Then in the market place judg'd (oh sad state) By th'Captain and the City Potentates. Then usd with all extremity behold Vetius Epagathus no longer could Refrain (that Choice young Noble, pious bold And Zelous man like Zachary of old For Holy Walking) made his suite that he To plead the Christians Case might sufferd be But not permitted, met with this demand Art thou a Christian? Whence even out of hand His loud voice sounded I'm a Christian. So He's stild their Advocate, doth to them go, And by his Spirit, Zeale, Example they Were mightily incouragd in their way. Yet some there were that fell through pannick Fear Which did perplex them, Farthermore they hear Their Pagan Servants load them with (like beasts) Jocasta's incest, and Thyastes' Feast. Hence now all tore to pieces them in rage As worthy now of nothing but a Stage. They're in such nasty prisons forct to ly The Sinck doth poyson certain that they dy. Now a Sanctus Deacon of Vienna Saints Tormented more than can be told nere faints, By all their tortures to their madding come No other answers but Christianus sum. Hence to his tender bowells they apply Brass plates red not that scorch him up and fry, Draw up and purse his Wounded body so, That it had lost all Human Shape and show. An other time his body being sore And swoln up, all ore, could not endure Ones finger's touch, he is had out again And they apply thereto tortures in vain. Their torment instruments by power divine Do Cure his body, proove his medicine, Restore him to his former shape and bring His members to their Use, a wondrous thing. He and Maturus then another time Are made the Stage play, must the scaffold climbe, All kinds of torments suffer, scourging, Fray Of Wild beast, torn, as if the other day They'd sufferd nothing; then they are set in A Red hot iron Chaire whose fryings sing As on a Gridiron upon coales, whose sent By frying in the peoples noses went: Yet nothing could they gain of Sanctus save That good Confession which before he gave. These holy men thus made the peoples game This day till spent, and then at length were slain. They spend their hellish rage again with spite Upon Blandina brought to open sight, Tormenting her by Course all day long till They're jaded out, sit down, sum up the bill. Had torn and rent her body, said that one Of these sore torments were enough alone To pluck her soul out of her body, they Sat down, and could no more on her assay. But this blesst Saint as often as she said I am a Christian, not bad pranck have plaid Was wonderful refresht and was beside Imboldened these torments to abide. And then another time she's took and hung In Gibbits low, that wild beasts forth might come And tare her off, then down she's took again And when she'd been scourgd, frying did sustain Lapt in a net and cast to Wild Bulls Fand Upon their Horns, her Soul on Christ did stand So fixt its thought she felt small pain, but were At last beheaded in Christs Quarrell deare. Then Attalus of Pergana who was A Church foundation Filler out doth pass Cast to wild beast: then on the red hot Chair Of Iron and his savour sented there Bespake them thus, behold this that ye do Is eating Humane flesh: we don't do so We eat not men nor Wickedness commit And thus at last he's slain, a martyre fit. One Alexander a Physitian's said In this same sort a martyre too was made. And so was Ponticus a youth, And they Were martyr'd too that faild the other day. Thus went the Case till God did Mark Confound In Germany, and's host nigh compasst round By Cruell foes, in passages full streight And with a five dayes thirst procur'd by heat Had then deliverance from heaven brought By Christian Souldiers that the same things sought By earnest prayre. And also when most grave Apologies some worthy ones him gave He did all Cruelty surcease that they Accounted now they had an Halcyon day. And when the Royall Bonett of did hop From Verus unto Commodus his top The peace remaind with Christians, yet the taile Of this Red firebrand did some assaile. That Noble Senator of Rome whose name Was Apolonius, a Christian, Came Before the judge Perennine, when complaint Was laid against him; 'gainst the Laws-Restraint. On pain of Death upon a faulse Charge laid Against a Christian, hence the man was made To beare the Sentence and his legs are broke And so he fell under a righteous stroke. But then the Judge upon entreaties and His Warrant given for his live in hand Prevailing, Apolonius in briefe An Eloquent defence of his beliefe Before the Senate laid, Which done they came And spite of promise head him for the same, According to their Law, that Christians who Are raignd, and turn not, shall not pass off so. Vencent, Euseby, and Potentian With Peregrine who laboured each man To bring poore souls to Christ, were tortured Then presst with weight of Lead till fully dead. Their Convert Julius a Senator Did bravely shew unto the Emperour His Faith, and did affirm that who adore His Gods must perish and for evermore. And when they could not cause him t'eat this breath He's cruelly with Cudgells thrasht to death. The Sparkling Shine of Gods Justice Patience thus Exercisd Gods Providence Doth in her Checker'd Mashes hang the Shine Of Justice in such Spangles as from thence Dropt here and there are by the hand Divine Some instances where of I blazon would Upon this Flag, all blancht there with like gold. Justice persues the Jews still for their Sin, Poor Nation now, how hast thou banisht Grace, Quite from thy Tents? Vengeance red hot steps in Oh thou art plunged in a dismall Case, Thy land is by thy wickedness well nigh Laid Desolate, thou must not in it ly. The Jews Rebell; fall fifty thousand slain By Adrians Sword, have fifty Castles stroi'de Nine hundred fourscore towns untownd again, By Sickness, Sword, Fire, Famine almost void, Jerusalem new built, new namde, and new Enpeoplde, by the Gentile not the Jew. At Rome in Trajans reign the Pantheon And Nero's Golden House the lightning burnd, In Asia Dreadfull Earth Quakes whereupon Four Cities were in Asia overturnd The very Earth doth tremble at the Flood That overflows it thus of Martyres blood. And Antioch while Trajan there perchance So shaken was, that neighbouring mountains tall Were tore and Casus that did high advance Ore all in Syria tumbling down did fall. And Rivers dry did grow: the Earth moreore An horrid lowing made, the Sea did roare. The ruind building dreadfully did Clash, The Schreeching of sad men was high and greate, Such darkness made by dust that mixed was One Could not heare another, se or speak. The Emperour took through a window there Out of the ruind building sav'd thus were. And in the Agarean War did rise Thunders and Lightnings, strange Rainbow, storms Vast Hails, Stones too and mighty Swarms of Flies, That did anoy them, who were full of scorns. They did infest the Romans meat and drinck They swarmed on with a most nautious Stinck. God still comes nigher, he now takes in hand The Wicked man his members do unjoynt, His body's numbd his senses, lose command; He thinks he poyson'd is (Gods hand doth point) Then swells with Water twixt the flesh and fell, His Gost doth bid his Carkass thus farewell. In Adrians time great Earth Quakes too God brings: That Nicomedia, and Nice nigh stroy. Soon after these Nicopolis down flings Yea and Cesaria as utterly Then Inquest makes for Blood. Blood new so skips From Adrian's nose as frighted out of'ts wits. And now therewith such torments him surprize, He Calls for Death, seeks to dispatch his life. He wasts away, then doth a Dropsy rise Which did refuse his Charms and Spells so rife. His blood breaks down all dams still, and will flow His Tortures too will not be Charmd but grow. He asketh Poyson of his Doctor then But such a Potion never can obtain. Then Craves a Sword, bids mony for't to's men But none do reach him this to end his pain. At length by torments more than can be told He is dispatcht and tumbled down to mould. And in the Reign of Pius sad things light As Famine, Earthquakes that did towns destroy In Rhodes and Asia, the Circk stroyd quite Three hundred forty houses burnt down ly At Rome and Narbon City, Antioch, And Carthage Market place, burnt turnd to Smoake. Tyber oreflows its bancks: a boy is born With two heads, then five babes born at a time A mighty Cristed Snake was seen off shorn And eat itself up halfe in Arabs Clime. A mighty Plague rag'd in Arabia Barly from tree twigs grew in Morsia. In Commodus his reign then Lightning turn'd The Capitoline Temple into dust The neighboring Famous Library burnd, The Temple too of Peace soon after Crusht, And Vesta Temple and the Palace by her Much of the City too, and all by fire. Then Commodus the Senate did define More Cruell than Domitian, and impure Than Nero, comes unto his tragick time Doth drinke a draught of Poyson for a Cure. Which failing, he with Nariss scuffling In jest, in earnest throtled was by him. Touching Narcissus of Jerusalem Gainst whom three wicked guilty persons rose, He taxed is before the Church by them, They do the Crime under dread Caths depose, Which done, the Good Old man for griefe retires, Although the Church did not believe those liers. The first doth wish he might be burnt if he Spake not the truth; the second if he li'de By Cruell Sickness might surprised bee, The third that's Sight might out be pluckt or glide If he spake false and this they did, its said Lest by Narcissus they ashame be made. But see the Case. The first mans house by night And he and all therein are burnt by fire. The second is surprizd in all mens sight By Cruell sickness and thereby expires. The third much terrifide, the Fact descries And With reperting tears weeps out his Eyes. Now Justice hath Narcissus made more Shine He from his solitary Place doth pass Unto his sacred Charge, a grave Divine When aged eight score years and three he was. Thus Justice, see, doth see and show her Shine While Patience doth Gods providence enline. When the Imperiall Chair had voided out Its Excrements vile Commodus with shouts And Pertinax and Julian had born The Diadem but scarcely had it worn, The Imperiall Laurell by their fall did hap To stick as feather in Severu's Cap. Who when he'd five yeare wore it, did begin The thi ? third Century to enter in, Which now we Come to view how God did guild It with his radients Beams, whose Spangles filld It all in glorious blanches dawbd ore fresh With Mercy, Patience bright, and Righteousness. 200The Shine of Mercy Still Mercy pencills out a gracious Shine Blancht bravely or'e this Century of time That Spirits spiriting a joyous Rhime Do overflow Who can forbare those nimble songs of Praise Beholding Grace to sprindge her glorious Rayes In every Corner, and Choice Organs layes Her shine to show. See how these radient Pearls through which there breakes These Glorious Beams that Cluster'd ly in Heaps In Asia, Africk, Europe shine which speaks Her holy Joy. Jerusalem her Church as bosst in gold Dios, Germanion and Gordous, Old Narcissica, then Alexander holds Grace to apply. And after Mezabanes there arose, Then Hymeneus came in to disclose Christs glorious grace, which through these Lanthorns flows And gives its Shine. Zambas and Hermon followd in that place As shining stars darting the beames of Grace Abroad all round. This Church in happy Case A gracious time. At Antioch Christs Golden Candlestick Filld with these flaming Lights that rise up thick, Serapion, Asclepiad, Philet, yet Christ shineth here. Zechinus, Babylas, then Julius came Demetreanus (then came one a Shame Who were Expelld) then Domnos held the same And flamed Cleare Timeus, Ciryll and Dorothe here shone In Laodice Socrates was well known Luseby, Anatoly, Stephen grown Then Theodote. In th'Church then at Cesarea Palestine Shone Theoctist, then Domnus the Divine, Theotecnus, Agapya, Pamphil shine Of Worthy note In Affrica this brightsom glory lays Too many down to name to bear her rayes Turtullian and Cyprian whose prayes Ariseth high; And famous Origen scarce to be matcht Plutarch and Thaumatourous by him hatcht Great Aphricanus, Heraclas who Watcht Christ Cause to Eye. Denyse, Hippolytus, and Maximus, Cheremon Hierax Ammonius These and such other that appeare to us That bravely rose Who in their day did give a glorious light And as Choice Gospell Candles burned bright And Carrid on their Spiritual war aright Against their foes. Come we now ore the Seas to Europes main, Search Greece and Italy, with France, and Spaine, For such as with the Gospell Glory flame Such Stars we'st finde. Yea, and so many of them numberd stand As do exceed in notes, and number, and Esteem, the Pen and scribble under hand To be definde But by these then as so many bright Beames Of Orient Rayes the Sun of Grace out gleams Grace gives her Shine, and sends her blissfull Streams The World to guild. And to attract mens hearts, and line them well With sanctifying Grace, which doth Excell Which shine of Grace now Chimes out Praises Bell With Glory filld. The Exercise of Divine Patience. How should such glorious Grace in folds of Shines Displaid, drill all mens Lives to Holy Lines? And make the world like Candent Iron, or The Globe of Glory shine in Graces war? But if it be abused, or Disdain'd Can Vengeance sleep or Chalterd be restrain'd? Gods Patience then must shine as bright, so long As such bright shining Grace abusd bears wrong. And thus it plainly is while out doth blaze Errour, and Tyranny under these Rayes. Patience respecting Errours. When such bright Glorious Candles flame, one'd thinke Men should inlightned be, yea, should they winke; Patience therefore is exercised high When in this Shine men clearly go awry. Choice famous Pillars in Gods house renown'd Tainted with Spots, in Errours oft are found. The Great and brave Turtullian that did plead Christ Cause by Choice Apologies to lead Men persecuting to a gentler minde, Unto Montanist Errours is inclin'de. Nay many other strange absurdities Run through his Pen as spots upon him rise. That Brave-Brave Cyprian whose glory Chimes Like Musick and smells Rosy like His times Were graced with him: yet he did mentain Rebaptization, and ran in that strain A Carthage Councill which Consisted then Of Bishops Sixty, Priests and Deacons, men Of Common sort it is not said how many. He also as Montanus held when any Baptized were, they must anncinted bee He gave too much to Works: the Will held Free. That mighty, learned pious Origen Thy Glory, Egypt, very few such men Is dapled yet with many streaks, and blurs Which as ill Juyce the sick man's mouth up furs Do often marr the Readers mouth, although Whether these blots are his its hard to show. His Works sophisticated are its known, Hence fathers Bastards: brats none of his own. Yet in his notes he an Alladist is More than is meet wherein he sure did miss, And slipt with Peters sadly, which had bin As hard to Peter as it was with him Had Peter been of Alexadrine Church Or Christ had given him but such a lurch. That Famous Dionysius who did stay And feed the Church of Alexandria Is judgd to lay, wanting an heedfull Eye The stepping stone to th'Arian Heresy And Beryll that the Bostrian Ring adornd Thus spotted was, holding that Christ not born Nor in the Virgin yet Concieved possesst Not a subsistence in the Fathers breast Distinguisht from his own, although he were By Origen reduc'de to shine more cleare Methodius of Tyre is also found Of Righteousnes by natures Law unsound And Theodore Calld Thaumaturg whose Shine At NeoCesaria was bright Divine Did strangely yet touching Gods Providence Dream things that hardly hold a savory sense. But let me stop my pen. Enough of this Whereby Gods exercisd by faults in his. Schisms Now or a step just back that former fray That ages past began 'bout Easter day Grew up so hot brake out like burning fire Wherein Prognostick Symptoms did aspire Of Romes Proud Antichristian spirit in Its Bishop Victor, like the man of Sin, Who Excommunicated now through pride The Asian Churches all who then denide To change their Easter from the fourteenth day Unto the Sabbath day before, as they Here of the Western Churches had decreed Hence Victor Ragde, Yet others queld his Deed. More Patience still is calld for there up springs A rent at Rome, Novatus there begins To tare the Church a pieces, and to binde It up again and heale it well we finde Did Caust much pains although at last through grace The Rent is heald: Novatus lost his Case. Another rent is made worse than the first Stephen playes Pope at Rome, and doth disburst Dismissive Letters of Communion And so denies to stand in Union With Affricans brave Churches, and with those That with them in Rebaptization close. Hereticks And Hereticks which do Choice truth greate Shame Did greatly Patience try as out they Came Novatus vile did broach his nasty Cask Who put poor humble souls to such a task, As no repentance could procure away Of Readmission if they once did stray. Which notion found in Affrick too much Room That ruin'd Origen. Oh! Cruell doom! Sabellius then from his Pandora's box His Cursed Heresy more vile unlocks. And was an Antitrinitarian Den'd the Trinity. Oh foolish man. Then Paulus Samolatenus up rose At Antioch, Christs Godhead did oppose Whom Malchion did in the Councill there Confound in open disputation cleare. The Originall of Nunsiah maids began I th' Hereticks stild Origenians Who marriage decride, yet women know Yet mean did use to keep their bellies low. Another sort there were of these whose shame They father do of Origen of Fame. These did assert Christ and the Holy Ghost Were Creatures, and the Soule from heavens Coast Came down unto the Body, made of Clay As to a jayle. Noe Resurrection day They own unto the Dead, and hold this fast That Divells shall be saved at the last. How did these things Gods Patience exercise Its Glory hence did mightily arise. Gods Patience under Tyrannicall Persecutions. Now Persecutions of Christs Glorious Light Doth spring afresh with Fury, Rage, and Spite. Sedition and Rebellion, Babicide Incest and Sacriledge, (oh wretched Tribe) Eating flesh Raw, strange lust (whereof its plain The Gnosticks guilty were as some mentain) And Worshiping an Asses head at times And Worshiping the Sun were made their Crime But yet the blackest Crime was this, they would All worship from all Idoll Gods with hold, And hence they needs must fall: for there doth rise The fift strong Persecution on this Wise. 210The Fift Persecution. The Fift hot Persecution now out brake Under Severus for the Gospell sake In Affrick, and in Asia raged most Innumerable suffered in this Coast: Leonides, (whose Son was Origen Whom as he slept he would his bosom then Uncov'ring kiss, Give thanks to God that hee Had him so happy Father made to bee Of such an happy Child) now first out Came And was beheaded for Christ blessed name. At Alexandria now there Martyrde were Plutarch, Serenus too his brother deare, Rais, Marcella, and her Daughter fair Potamiena (on whose Skin laid bare They poured boyling pitch) were burnt with fire, Then came Heraclides, (the rage grows higher) Heron, a second Serenus so bright Beheaded were, also this axe did smite Basilides his head off who is said Betrusted was with Potamien the maid To se here executed, and did Chid The raging rout that did the maid deride. To whom she said, be Cheary, Sir, I'le pray That Christ may mercy unto you display. And hereupon a Christian he became And was cast in the prison for the same. He said he saw her in the night come down And did his head adorn too with a Crown. In France Andoclus whom Old Polycarp Had sent to Play upon the Gospell Harp Unto them there, was beat with bat, then's head Was severd off. Thus was he martyred. Now Famous Ireneus out doth come And with him multitudes to martyredom Felicitas, Perpetua, another Calld Revocate, Saturnine with his brother Satyrus thown to wild beasts to be slain Secundulus in prison Death doth gain At Alexandria for Christs Glorious Cause Under Severus by his Wicked Laws. 215Severus then being slain at Yorke his son Calld Bassianus Caracalla run Upon his brother Geta, did him slay In England, did six years the Scepter sway. 220Macrinus with Diadamenus came Unto the Throne when Caracall was slain, Whose weighty Crowns did crush them underground 221When that a single yeare was turned round. Then Heliogabalus that greedy gut In the Imperiall Throne of gold did strut, The Miror of Excess, the Prodigy Of Gluttony and filthy Ribauldry His Cloaths of God and costly Silks, his Shooes Glisterd with pretious Stones they did, did use To ware no garment twice nor twice one fare. Sometime they for his palate did prepare The tongues of Popingais, and birds that sung Most sweetly for him disht up, to him come Five thousand Fowles, six thousand fishes lie Serv'd at one Supper up (oh! Luxury) His Lamps were fed with Balm to light him eke He filld his Fish Ponds with Rosewater sweet. He was attended in his progress out There with six hundred Charrots round about Filld all with Puncks and Pandors, Bawds and Whores For Varlets he preferd to places stores. Did Sacrifice up Children and when he Learnd by his Wizzards that his death should bee By violence silk halters got he did To hang himself, and Golden Swords to rid Himselfe therewith. Ranck poysons too he kept In Jacinct and in Emralds to effect His Death, nay and he made a lofty tower Whose floore was guild with gold against that hour And border'd too with pretious Stones from which He if assaild then ment himselfe to pitch Down headlong and destroy himselfe. At last He's slain, dragd through the town, in Tiber cast. 225Then Alexander came unto the Throne By whom respect is unto Christians shown. His Mother Mammea adornd (is said) To be with Grace to whom the truth displaid Was tendered by Origen of Fame But yet the Cruell law not dead, forth came And by some Wicked Judges did take place Hence many fell (some say) ev'n now for Grace. As Certain Roman Bishops, touching whom Eusebius tells not their Martyredom. Tibertius, Cicly and her Husband Calld Valerian, and Agapete they thralld With Cruell tortures which he did endure And of all sorts it's said a many more, Yet some suppose Historians here faile That now at Rome such doing should prevaile Under a Friendly Prince, as not before Which things if done, its rather thought therefore Were done under some Persecuting Foe Not under Alexander, as not soe. 237The Sixth Persecution. Dead Alexander lets th'Imperiall Mace Fall unto Maximinus who tooke place, Who did the Vulcan at hells Bellows keep Blowd up the fire of Persecutions Deep, Chiefly against the Ministers that so He might the Cause the sooner overthrow. Its thought those Martyres in the Cause of Grace In Alexanders reign should take this place. But Origens assayes of Martyredome Touching these dayes now lost, we have no sum. 244Hereof laid down before us. Next slips in One Gordian to turn the Royall Rim Imperiall and gently moude the same. 247Yet Philip slew him and the throne did gain Who was by Origen and Fabian Much labourd with and made a Christian Converted and baptizd, he and all his, And seing he had greatly done amiss The Church would in no wise receive him in Without Confession of his Faith, and Sin. The former persecution took away Hippolytus and heaps lay slain they say. But Philip making better dayes was slain 251By Decius soon who did the Empire gain. The Seventh Persecution. Decius that bore th'Imperiall Diadem Did stain it with the holy blood of them That followed Gods Holy Lamb, for they Were by this Tyrant murd'red, made away. The Cause is said to be with other things This Chiefly, Cause, Philip while reigning brings The Imperiall Treasure to the Custody Of Fabian the Bishop, hence you'l spy That Philips Love to Fabian soon brought The hate of Decius. Hence Fabian's caught And martyrd soon by Decius when in throne, (Though when the Church him Bishop chose, its shown, A Dove that flew above sat on his Head In sight of all: Hence he away was lead And made Romes Bishop. Now Christ Martyre Deare) Orders now cry'de, t'slay Christians ery where Jerusalems Choice Bishop Alexander In prison dies now under this Commander So died Babylas in prison now Who held at Antioch the Gospell plow. And forty Antiochian Virgins were Now martyred (as Vincent makes us heare) And Babylas of Nicomedia Doth suffer martyredom in this sad day. Peter at Lampsar now in Phrygia, Paul, Andrew, Nichomach, Dionysia At Troida. They take at Babylon And send to Spain the same who dy each one. German, Theophilus, with Polychron Vitalis, Nestor in Cesaria known, The Crown of Martyredom they now obtain. At Cardala in Persis forth there Came To martyredom Olympiades, also One Maximus at Tyre there out doth goe Audax, Anatoly a Virgin there That for the name of Christ now martyrd were. At Alexandria in Egypt came Metra a minister they Clubt (Oh shame) With sharp Roods stabd the face and Eyes, then stond. Quinta a woman then is, who Christ ownd, Dragd through the street, dasht upon milstones there Scourgd and is martyred in such a geer. They Apolony'th th'Virgins teeth out dasht Then burnt her: and Serapion they Cast Out of an upper loft down head long, killd. A Souldier too dide now rather than yield. One Julian and Cronion, Macar Four Women, Epimachus in this War And Alexander: Heron, Ater, and Isidorus, Nemesion too now damnd Unto the flames were burnd, for Christ alone Tyrannically thus were overthrown, And Amonarion a virgin so Mercuria and Dianysia too Choice Women by the Cruell sword were slain Ischirion for Christ did death sustain And multitudes that to the mountains flew Consum'de with hunger, thirst, Cold, Sickness, too, Theeves and wild Beast of Whom One Cheremon Bishop of Nile flew with his wife for one But never more was heard of and although They sought him greatly yet the Case went so. At Florens Meniate, in Sicily The Damsell Agatha do martyred ly. At Nice Good Triphon: and at Ephesus Seven Christian Souldiers in mount Celius Lurkt in a Cave to shun the tyrants breath Were stopt therein, and famished to death. A Souldier now that torments Conquoured Was laid out in a garden on a bed Mong Lillies, and sweet Roses grace to dull And courted by an Harlot beautifull With all her Wiles to draw him to her Sin But he as she was then a kissing him Bit off his tongue and spit it in her face, Thus Conquour'd her attempts to her disgrace. At Antioch the Virgin Theodore Condemned was for Christ to beggi'n o're To Souldiers Lusts. Who ready for the thing One Didimus a Christian first stept in In Souldiers dress, her rounded in the eare Hence changing of apparell, he stayd there And she out passt, but when the Souldiers vile Did finde their lusts deluded by this Wile The matter to the President is brought The Souldiers for a maid a man had caught And Didymus is 'fore him had, and layes The matter all before him. He delayes Not then but sentenc't him forthwith to dy. Which Theodora hearing draweth nigh Tenders herselfe for him that he might live. The wicked Judge then on her too did give The Sentence that she was Condemned too Hence both were headed, then were burnt also. One Agathon at Alexandria Justin, one Nicostrate and Portius lay At Rome destroyde, Abdon and Sennas who Did bury those at Corduba brought to That place from Babylon beheaded were Amnon and Zenon too was serv'd so there. Secundian, Marcellian, Verian Vencent asserts were gibbeted each man Fires then set to their sides, to torture them Then after were beheaded by these men. In Spain fell Teragon. In Verona Zeno, Maurinus at Cesaria Archemius too, and at Milain Private The Bishop and Theodore (Oh sad Fate) At Rome one Moses and Cornelius A Roman Bishop, and Aurelius Mappolicus did also spend their blood For Christ as they Idolatry withstood. Now Origen that worthy man of might Is on the Cause of Christ comes to this fight Sustaineth bonds, and torments, wrackt with bars Of Iron, Cast in Dungeons, is threatend far To be exilld and burnd, yet nought prevaile Their Jugling flatteries do him assaile Belike they seem ore come and grant that they Will be baptized Christians th'following day. Hence with designs most gracious out doth goe With them to be baptizd, but stay, not so They then replide, and on him plaid their game, And catching one poore word of his, proclaim, That Origen had sacrificed which Like as a Dagger in his heart there sticks, He's wounded to the Quick; the Church doth frown And him reject. He sincks in Sorrows, drowns In penetentiall tears, and goes to Tyre Where in obscurity he did expire. And now about a Minister that lay At point of death 'bout Carthage thus did pray, That he might now depart and be dischargd Yet feare of Death was greate and much enlarg'd, To whom a young man came so gloriously Scarce to be lookt upon by mortall Eye, And thus bespake, To suffer you're affraid, And to depart you are not Willing, said, What shall I doe for you? Oh strange! but loe Under the Word of Cypriats 't doth goe. 255But now the Rose falling from Decius' Crown Gallus doth Catch the scepter tumbling down, And doth renew the old attempt again And banisheth Christs ministers, mentain His Oars and Mines by Christians Choice forth sent By him into this sort of Banishment. Now Cyprian is thought to be Excild, Nemosian, Felix, Lucius thus assoild And other Bishops Elders Deacons thus Yet some assert the fact to Decius. Yet Lucius soon returnd again to Rome And there closd up his day by Martyredome And Stephen who his Bishoprick obtaind Did pledge him in the selfe same Cup there gaind. But Gallus having broke his spurs lets fall The Wing. Emelian came in the Cock pit tall And there before he came to use his heel Doth lose his head, is neckt by gags of Steel. The Eight Persecution 256Valerians Head th'Imperiall Turbit caught As from Emelians it dropt as nought And wore it well at first; his Courts abound With Pious Christians Orthodox and sound, Untill an arch Magician did bewitch Him unto Cruell things from the better twitch Him away quite through spite he bore unto The Christians cause they mard his magick show Blockt up his Sorceries and Charms and tricks Hence now this Prince bewitcht out of his wits Doth sacrifice to Divells Infants young, Plucks out their Intrains and in them doth sum His fortunes up, doth persecutions raise Against the Christian, whom he vilely slayes. Men, Women, Young and Old, Maids, Matrons Old Ideots and Souldiers, these sad strokes Enfold, Jayles, Scourgings, Banishments Wild Beasts, the Fire Taring the Flesh, Gridirons and swords they tire. Now Cyprian after his banishment Beheaded is and so to heaven sent. And Vincent doth assert three hundred more Was in a Lime killn burnd at Carthag Doore At Tuberba in Affrick headed they Secunda, Donatilla, Maxima And in Cesaria Palestine they throw Priscus and Alexander Malchus too Unto Wild beasts to be devourd thereby And a Gool Woman too for piety Verona's Bishop Zenon doth sustain A Crown of Martyrdom for Christ blesst Name. In Simela under th'Italian Alps One Pontius now took by these hellish Scalps Is hanged first upon the Cruell Wrack Then cast to Beasts, thence to the fire doth Pack Thus cruelly he is a Martyre made. Some say now Rome is as a shambles laid Now Sextus bishop and his Deacon rainde Nemesius are beheaded, as 't is fam'd. Laurence another Deacon of Choice fame Of Romes blesst Church the third day after came Unto his Martyrdom, Whose Case runs thus The greedy Tyrant being very flush With hopes to get the Churches Treasure all Doth Deacon Laurence now charge whom they call To shew him where the Churches Treasure were Who therefore causd great number to appeare Of Christian Poore ore whom with arms displayd These are the Churches treasures then he said These Treasures are indeed, in them the Faith Of Christ doth reign, in them Christ mansion hath. Oh now what tongue is able to express The Tyrants fury and enragedness. He stampt, star'd, Rampt and far'd as lost his Wit, His Eyes did glow, Mouth foam, Teeth gnasht and bit And like a Lyon out doth breake thus arr, What hath this Villain mockt the Emperour Away with him, away with him, him Whip With Scourges, Scurge with rods, and buffit flip With fist, him brain with bats. What doth he slur? What joke and jybe upon the Emperour? Pinch him with firy tongs and gird him up With burning plates. Strong Chains upon him put The firy Forkes and Gridiron bed out bring Make it red hot, this Rebbell on there fling Him Rost, him broyle, him toss, him turn again Oh ye Tormentors on your sorest pain They whirle him on't, but oh God made this Bed Like to a Down bed where he's nourished And broyling long on this red firy Grate Presst with red forks was patient and thus spake This side is rost, turn't up, thou Tyrant great Try whether rost or raw is better meat. And in this wise he did to Christ ascend And by a glorious martyredom did end. Eugeny Philips daughter who they say Was Presiden of Alexandria Suckt Gospell breast, that she at length then flew With Prothus and with Jacinth to eschue The Persecution or a Wedden band Her Pagan Parents had for her in hand, In mans attire she went and grew so high In wisdom till of her society She head was made, and now her beauty clear Allured the lust of an old matron there Nam'd Melancy who to obtain her Will Of this supposed man did by her Skill Allure to folly, but repulse sustaind And had the hazzard of such Sin explaind. Melancy seing by no meanes she could Attain her end, could not from envy hold. And fearing lest Eugeny should her shame She thought it wisdom first to play her game. She goes to Philip and complaineth first Against Eugeny and the rest (Oh Curst) As that Eugeny did attempt to bring Her unto Whordom, yea, unto that Sin. This fame now flies, the Christians now are vile, And all salute them with a shamefull Stile. And Philip cites Eugeny now t'appeare Who comming now and doth herselfe thus cleare, Melancy doth me wrong, it is not so, But she attempted me her lust unto. Which when she saw I'de not with her comply She slanders me, yea, and the Company, And if you'l not believe me know this day I am your Daughter, your Eugnia, And that those were her Schoolemates with her there Jacincth and Prothus, and she made it cleare Wherefore she left them; thus she cleard her name And overwhelmd Melancy with greate shame. The Christians they were filld with joy and oh Her Parents joy did hereupon oreflow, And in due time her fathers heart found place By her attempts for Christ and for his grace. And in this holy War was, as they say, A martyre made at Alexandria. Eugeny, Prothus, yea, and Jacincth too Did suffer martyredom at Rome also. Now Fructuosus Bishop choice and true With Eulogy and Augury the two Choice Deacons of the Church at Taracon In Spain are burnt for Christ the holy one. 272But when Valerian was Captive ta'ne His son Galienus did put out this flame Yet not so fully but some few did fall Under its Sparks though in the ashes small. Marinus who was at Cesaria A military gentleman did lay Claim to a Place of honours which then fell As unto him the next but, as they tell, Some who then strove to wipe him of the same Chargd him as Christian, hence he now out came And was beheaded for this glorious Cause Under a Pagan judge by Pagan laws. But Galienus slinking from the throne 274One Claudius succeeds who is forth shown A gentle Emperour who two years reignd And then Quintillian the Throne obtaind Who sat therein no more than seventeen days 278But comes Aurelian and wares the Bayes. The Ninth Persecution Aurelian a golden Prince indeed If that his name and nature well agreed, Would sharply Chide the saying old fulfills A Doctor good, but gives too bitter pills. At length lets out his rage against Christ flock Yet when's decrees were written down to knock The hand divine prevented then the same By Thunder and by Lightning which came And terrifide him, so as that he could Not sign his own Decrees, God did back hold And shook his hand so. And his men him slay 284Soon after marching to Hieraclea Then Annius Tacitus the helm doth hand Florinus after him doth two months stand. 284Then after him a Golden Mark steps in Aurelius Probus, he the game did win. Then Carus with his sons three years bore sway Then Dioclesian after gains the Day, Who in his nineteenth yeare did blow the flame Of Persecution up against Christs name, Who by his Concubine was told that he Should slay a bore and Emperour should bee. He hence slew many, still no Empire had He usd this Proverb, let be good or bad, I kill the Bore another eats the meate But being Chosen to th'Imperiall seat And seing one nam'd Aper who had slain The former Emperour he swore again Numerian the wrong man was and so 290He forth with Aper slew and came unto Th'Imperiall seat wherein his Tyranny In the next Century ragd cruelly. Gods Justice gives its Shine. Gods Patience through this Century his Shine Having Display'd Gods Justice her Divine And sparkling Glory Shines full out as cleare And burnisht stands upon her Scutchons here. God did the Empire smite with barrenness Ruind their Harvests with great floods, distress With storms and Tempests and Ecclipses black Signs, Plagues, and Tyrants breaking of its back. Vigelius that first did dip his lance In Christian blood was stricken blind, sad Chance And Claud Herminian, Cappadocias Plague, Dide of the plague, when while alive (thus said) When boyling up alive with Worms cride so Let no man know't lest Christians joyous grow. Severus now comes to the Pillary And made to run the Gantlet and die After he turnd his sword against Christ Cause His Empire's filld with wars and full of flaws. He's in each member so tormented now And pains so great his petty toes do plow He begs a Cup of poyson, but doth fall At York by Scots who pay him there his all. His Carracalla son slayes Geta and Himself is slain by one Macrinu's hand. Antiochus a persecuting judge Is not permitted from the Bench to budge. But down he tumbles from his Judgment Seate And there he dies of Bowell burning heate. And Maximinus when he banisht had The Pastors of Christ flocks met with things bad. The Roman Senate did him hatefull hold And while he liv'd appoinded as he would Some other Emperours: His Souldery In Africa did him desert and fly. His Son a youth they tore a pieces all And in a joculary way let fall This adage old, We of the worst base kinde Will not preserve a Whelp we are designd. And he when slaind had all his friends when known Took, slain, dracgd out cast into Channells thrown. Then Decius that the sixth hot brush brought in Is made to run the Chapter house for's sin, Who waring on the Goths he and his son Was ruin'd fell, he in a Whirlepit run To shun there hands and thus this Tyrant fell As by an Emblem of the pit of hell. Gods Justice spard not when apostatizd, For some of these were grievously surprizd By Evill spirits, as a maid who when She had denide Christ cause was ceized then In such a sort, her teeth do tare her tongue, And so she dies with belly torments stronge. Another who when he should with them stand And joyn, for bread tock ashes in his hand, And other when he had denide his Call Was suddenly struck dumb (Oh Dismall fall). But to turn back to Gordians day we'st see A day as dark then as the darkst nights bee. The Sun so sadly Chast the following day That no man could, unless light Candles stay To give them Light, see or do any thing There was such grieveous Earth Quakes shivering That made the Earth her wide mouth open then And many Cities swallow with their men. In Alexanders day Joves Idoll bright Had's golden left hand melted off, which sight Made Alexander press the priests to do Him sacrifice to reconcile him so. Four Priests Devout his Temple enter in The morning being bright, but at the thing They and his Altar soon are smitten down By Lightning. The Day is darke, doth frown And is so darkned that without delay The People from the City fly away. The Mountain Atlas then in Philips reign A Traveller as some assert became. Gallus the Cockerill that did so crow Over Christ Chickens and bespur them so, His Comb is cut, his Empire also's made Tribute to pay unto the Scythick blade His Souldiers Spurs he feels; they him Reject This fighting Cock lies in the Cock pit neckt, And in his day a dreadfull Plague began To rage and in all Quarters raging ran All o're the Empire for full ten years Space Or fifteen years, that somewhat stopt their pace Of Persecution. But Valerian The part of Satan plai'd and not the man, Now hath his points unti'de and scourged is With War against the Persians (Oh short bliss) His Golden dayes are done. He's Captive led The Persian King Sapores poles his head, Makes him his horseblock, worse than laughing stock, Romes Emperour doth bow his back as block Whereon Sapores when he mounts doth tread And mount. This fine Christ set upon his head. And at the last Sapores doth him skin Alive, and Corn with Salt (O cruell thing) And Claudius, Valerians President The Divell did surprize (and now he's shent) And when his tongue was shread to little bits Hee Choake this Wretched man for all his tricks. Galienus then Valerians son alone His father being Captive, keeps the Throne With much adoe, for thirty Tyrants rise And make the Empire to them pay Excise As many Kings at once, as Emperours Have been till now from Cesar Dictator. Nay and Sapores from him tooke away Cilicia, Syria, Cappodocia. The Almans vexing France, storm Italy, The Goths did sack Pontus and Asia stroy, With Macedon and Greece. The Quades also And Sauromates possess Pannonia do. The Germans breake on Tarracon in Spain. These blemishes attend Galienus reign, Now Direfull Prodigies also appeare In ery nation. Now many dayes there were That mantled up the Earth with darkness black The noyse of thunders from the Earth did crack Which fell a ballowing like bulls, hence rose Amazing Earth Quakes and soon over throws And by the Earth that opend swollowd were Cities together with their people there. Asia doth suffer much, Rome shaken is And Lybea trembles too, Vast gapings yes In many places are in earth, the sea Sweeps many Seaports suddenly away. And Galienus by the guile was slain Of Aureol the tyrant at Millain. Aurelianus Justice takes to do And for his sin did bring his overthrow. Oh! Justice Bright, who will not thee adore? Thou certainly, although thou long mayst stay, Wilt call the Wicked out to pay their score, Or wilt thyselfe give unto them their pay. Thou greatly art abusd under thy name Much Wickedness doth pass. Oh! fy for shame. But now thou comest and blanchest thy white line Quite through these darksom Clouds, dost shew thy hand Pure White as Snow: and that no vile design Can smut thyselfe though some may thinke thee tan'd Ile kiss thy milke white hand and thee adore Because thou keepst for all an Eaven Score. The third Century Now the Third Century hath brought the Shine Of Grace, of Patience, Justice too Divine Through all her teers of Months and furlons too Of Years within her bounds, in Glorius hew, Unto the borders and the Selvedge where It hands them to the Century that pears. And now I come to trace their Rayes why fly And guild this fourth ensuing Century. 300The Shine of Grace. How should I Choose but make my nimble Feet Dance on thy Beames that string my Harp and meet Upon my Cords my Tunes with Glory sweet And lightens them? But I am Dull and keep no stops at all But by my blundrings oft the strings do fall Or else my bluntness doth thy beams begall Lord help me then. Behold, my Soule, how Graces Sun hath thrown Her Glorious Shines abroad the which have flown In flocks of Golden Doves which are her own And sparkle bright. Jerusalem this sparkling Grace doth guild Macarius, by whom the Same's Distilld Then Maximus, who had an Eye out drilld For Christs true light. The Arian Cyrill then slipt there awhile But outed was. Herenius free from guile Heraclius, Hilarius, whose style Was better far Cyrill again, then John then Prayd taught there, And now at Antioch there did shine Cleare Tyrran, Vital and Philagon who were A martyre Star. In other places rose bright stars of Grace The Brave Paphnatius who from his face Had lost an Eye and to the Mines must trace For Christs Choice name Who brought the Nicene Synod to the right Eusebius Pamphilus, a bright Light, Who in Cesaria's Candlestick flam'd bright With holy flame Gregory Mazianzen, And Nyssen Basill the Great, Eusebius, Emissen And Amphilochuiss choice Worthy men Whose glory shines In Alexandria Peter Bishop's made Then Alexander who 'gainst Arius pray'd The Wolfe might not among the sheep be staid At any time For then (saith he) who can thy Judgments know? But if the matters truely must so go Take me thy servant from this Life and loe The blow ensude Then Athanasius that bright shining star, A man of sorrow, Dydimus the War About the Holy Ghost man Well and far Did well Conclude. Arnobius may in this golden Chain Possess a linck: and Epiphanius claim Another who in Cyprus now did gain Such grace as shown But Cross the Seas In Italy there rose Besides at Rome too many to propose Eusebius of Vercells, whom Christs foes The Arians stone Jerom The Learned sprig of Pannonia But yet in Italy his grace we may Consider most and Oh Aquileia The Ruffins Raise Did send abroad their Gracious Radient shine There sprang another out of Victorine The flowring Rhetoritian of his time Now Grace displaise To come to Spain, thy glory Corduba By Oscius did make an Holy day Whom the Curst Arians scourgd when he was gray, Lash-Arguments. Juvencus did appear in Graces Hew Prudentius that doth eighteen Martyres shew Whose Verses of Poetick Measures View How they lament. In France at Poictiers Hilarys Beams out fly At Millain Holy Ambrose liv'd so high Was not asham'de to Live nor fraid to dy He dying said. In England Londons glorious star shone cleare Brave Restitutes who did preach Christ there And Keby Corine, who in Cornwall were A shine displaid Nay Graces Beams did now the Throne assay Did bellish ore the sword, the Crown orelay With Glorious shines, did guild this golden day Of Constantine Surprizd his Heart and Hand in truth, and make Them both her Cabbinets from which forth brake The Glory of the Pearles therein which spake Him most divine. The Glorious Sun Shine Dayes of Gospell Light Are shining forth, no force them to benight The golden Traces of the Gospell bright All now put on That Christ may be the Driver and his Cause The Weighty Worke this Conversation draws: And glory all the fruite, without all flaws Gaind hereupon This Champion grievd to see Maxentius Vile With all his beastly Villanies defile The City Rome and Empire thus to spoile Did muse Reliefe But now his Charms and Spells and Witcheries Do him good man with pannick feare surprize Against whose Charmes aloud to God he Cries Who easd his griefe Then lifting up his eyes to heaven, he soon Saw in the Skies west little after noon A Perfect shining Cross with letters shown That dorst were in't Thus In hoc Vince, yet for feare his sight Should run a Snick-Snarles he his Army streight Treats touching it and they beheld it bright As in a print. And pondring of it till the night orespred Him with her Vaile, When sleep laid down his head Christ with his Cross appear'd to him in bed Who lay a sleep, And bad him then the Cross he saw pourtray In his bright Banner, and the same display Implying that the Victory that way Should with him keep, And thus he did: and was too treated right Touching the Lord, he then engagu'd to fight Maxentius' Troops them routs and doth affright Maxentius who Upon the bridge of boats he as a Trap Set to take Constantine in, hath the hap To hansell sitst which into Tybers lap Did him soon throw. He with his Idols, Divells, C. arms and Spells Sinks in the Waves a fishing goes; farewell Maxentius and his hosts now let them tell The force of Charms. While glorious seasons doth by Constantine Upon the Roman Cities sweetly shine And he tryumphantly sings prayse and climbs Above all harms. He now doth hug the Gospell, Grace doth prize Advance Christs Cause, secure his truths, destroyes His foes and puts an end to Tyrannies Oh! sweet, sweet, day! The Churches tast his bounty, he restores Their banisht Ministers, doth heale their soars And kiss their scars they as Christs tassles wore Now Christians sway. And ore his Royall Palace to Disgrace All Pagan Gods he doth his Picture place With a Cross or'e't, a Couchant Dragon base Under its feet He greatly strove to keep in Unity Christs one bright Intrest people, and his Eye Oft gusht out tears, when Christians jaringly Livd, as unmeet. Thus Christianity enthron'de doth reign And sweeps down Hethenism, doth mentain The blessed Gospell, leads to lasting gain, Oh, stand amaizd! How doth the glorious sun of Grace thus shine? And glorifie these dayes which grace doth line? Out by the square and Compass all Divine? The Lord be Praisd. The Shine of Divine Patience. Gods Patience Comes takes Grace thus by her hand That shines so bright, entreates her back to stand That she may take her turn now to display Her Glorious shine through graces sunshine day. Her shine breakes forth while in such sunshine rise Contentions, Heresie, and Tyrannies. Patience Exercised under Carnall Christians Carriages. Oh! Patience with a Witness, while Grace Waits And draws out golden dayes of peace, dilates Her Liveries, meanwhile her Children fall Into Love Sickness to the Worldes bright all. While God doth Tyrants, like to Divells, binde They fall on one another (Oh! unkinde) Box one another thus about the eares: Do scratch out one anothers eyes, run Speares In one anothers Names up to the head, And strive to lay each others names as Dead, And now through Zeale unmannaged by light The Stones were squard and pollisht too full bright That build the fabrick of Monkesty Where Abby Lubbers now, like swine, do sty. Patience Exercised With Heresies Now sprang the Terebinthine Herecy In Baddas nere to Babylon whereby He said he was born of a Virgin pure, But Manes took the same in hand its sure Said he was Christ, yea, and the Comforter Chose twelve Apostles and did thus aver Christ was not truely but Phantastickly Was born, held Errours of Philosophy Hierar deni'd the Resurrection and Wedlock and Children dead to hell he damnd Did say Melchizedich Gods spirit was Miletius Bishop sacrific't (alas) To Idols, and a railer grew and loe Rome's Bishop Marcellinus did do soe And stifly did deny it when he'd done Till the Sinacssian Counsill gainst him run. And then he did Confess the fact and fell And satisfaction gave the Church as well. These and such others Heresies that rose Up in such grace displaid and it oppose Made Patience ware a mighty shine Divine Till Justice Craves of Patience leave to shine The Rod of Justice using Cruelties Doth still make Patience shining glory rise. Patience Exercised by Tyrants No wonder if the flock do run astray The Shephard set his Dog at them to baigh. Yet if he bites or Worries any, he Is exercisd thereat, and so we see These Curs let loose such dreadfull houghvack make That Patience much thus exercisd, out brake Her sparkling shine While Diaclesian Doth Tyrannize with Maximinian. The tenth Persecution 298When Diaclesian to the Throne up rose He Maximinian for his Colleague chose Then they Galerius Cesar'd for the East Constantius too for France and Brittain West. They gentle were; things prosperous went untill At Rome they meet and tryumph; now comes ill For Diaclesian gives Comand that he Should as a god by all adored bee. He's now the Brother of the Sun and Moon, He saith: and doth, now he did thus presume, Adorn his Shooes with Pretious Stones and gold And make the people kiss his feet he would. Apollo now out of an hollow Cave A Curled Oracle of such sort gave. He could not for the Righteous men speak true, False Oracles forth did his Trevet shew, His hair decayed because of them he said Hence this blinde Emperour this query made, Who are these Righteous Persons? Whereunto Apollo's Priest repli'd, They're Christians, know. This pleasd this Tyrants Palate; forthwith hee New torments for them should invented Bee. And his begining March gave way to, when Before the Easter feast his Edict then Came forth to pluck all Christian Temples down; Which executed was in ery town Upon the Feastivall, soon out he brings Another which all Holy Scriptures flings Into the fire which burnt in Market Streets. Another then in shamefullwise out sweeps All Christians out of Office Power also, And common persons doth in Prison throw, Unless they do Christs holy Cause abjure, And unto Paganry subscribe impure. Then out another came to imprison all Church Officers; Pastors, and Elders fall Under its Lash, Wracks, Frizlings of the Flesh Dragd unto Altars and assoild afresh With many Wiles and trialls; then the name Of those dismisst, they slanderously defame. These things did not one onely place obtain, But did the face of all the Empire stain. In Asia first these Tyrants rage did flame Where John a noble man out boldly came At Nicomedia when these Tyrants had A Pillar with their Vile decree there clad, Did pluck it off and openly it tare To pieces though they in the City were, For which he did a bitter death sustain Yet with a Chearfull looks while life remains Then came his tyranny to Princes brave The Nobles of his Family and gave Them drinke out of this bitter bitter cup, First Peter whom he Whips with whips that cut Untill his bones ly bare, then stript thus bare He's hoisted up on high into the aire But still abiding firmly in the faith He all his gaping tender Woundes then hath Filld up with salt and Vineger, yet hee Is filld with joy under these torments, see, Then on the Gridiron rosted with slow fires Untill his blessed soule to Christ retires. Then Came Dorotheus and Gorgonius out Men of the Privy Chamber Vallient Stout And Faithfull Christians of Great Place and said Why Emperour is Peter thus assaid? Why's that offence in him, the which here we Do all Confess? We of his Judgment bee. Which said the Tyrant takes them too in hand And ?ats them almost so then up they're hangd. There hapt a fire then in the Palace Hall, Which being Cast on Christians out they fall And them destroy. Anthimus bishop there With a greate multitude beheaded were Another Company they burn all down; A third they whirry in the Sea and drown. Irene, Eulampus, and Eulampia Agape, Chiona, Anastasia, Bound hand and foot unto a post set there For Christs Choice name thus burnt to Ashes were. These Cursed Edicts to a City came Of Phrygia, and there they did proclaim That all must worship Idols. But the Mayor The Aldermen and Captain all declare They Christians were, so were besieg'd in ire City and Citizens all burn with fire. In Arabrace nigh to Armenia Eustratius Duke, Sheriff of Licia Rebukt this rage, did openly profess Himself a Christian, hence they bind, undress And beate him bitterly, then parch him do With fire the which they to his bowell show, Then bast him too with salt and Vineger, They scorch and mangle him with shells so far That all his body seems a raw raw sore Yet was by grace recoverd as before Then was Convayed to Sebastia And there they with Orestes burnt his Clay. And at that Season was Eugenius Slain with Aurentius and Mardarius Mesopotamy too was filld with woe, Where many were hung by their feet and so Were smoothered with Smoke their heads hung in. In Cappadocia they usd this thing Mens legs were broke. Here dwelt a young man George On whom their Venom malice they disgorge He's prison'd, torn with iron hooks and burnd With burning lime, stretcht out with Cords hard turnd His hands, Feet, and his members cut off all Then is beheaded, thus this George did fall. Tyre tooke her Martyres and to Wild beast threw Bares, Libbards, Lyons who for hunger slew Those that them brought, but had no appetite To touch the Martyre's nor them hurt or bite. Hence out they take them and by Sword do slay These Holy ones, and Cast them in the sea. Five more they cast before a wild Bulls feet Who is so fierce he tosseth those that meet His horns as standing in the ring, doth tare Them as he tosseth them into the aire, And they are left for dead. They him provoke With siering iron, he fomes all in a Smoake Doth rend the Earth, doth fan the Aire, run round, Doth breath out Death, yet from the Saints rebound And will not touch them, God did him restrain, Hence they are took and by the Sword are slayn. In Tarsus in Cilicia Taratus Is martyred, with Probe and Andronicus. Sylvanus Gaza's bishop, thirty nine More with him dy in Phenice mettall mine Pamphillus Pillar of Cesaria's Church Is martyrd now. And Gordius did lurch His Enemies who once a Souldier came Aloud out now his Faith showd in Christs name. The Sheriff now enragd, him taunts and schooles, Calls for his Scourge, Wheele, Wrack, tormenting tools, To whom he said, t'will be my hindrance sure If I for Christ much torments don't endure. The Sheriff frets, commands he might have's share Of all the torments that they did prepare. In which this Gordius looks to heavens king, And with the Prophet did these sayings sing, âThe Lord my helper is, I will not bee âAfraid what any man can do to mee: âI will not be affraid of any ill âBecause that thou, oh Lord, art with mee still. Then did he blame those that's tormentors were, If that they favour'd him at all while here. The Sheriff then fell gugling him again Christ to deny: but yet he pipt in vain. In Scorn he said, you can't prefer in place Such as are meet for heaven's place through grace. Then he condemned is and as he to Be burnt goes, some him hug yet urge him do To spare himselfe he prayes them not to finde Such trouble for his settled quiet minde. Some do with tears entreat him to impart Denying words but not deny in heart: To whom he said man doth to righteousness Believe in heart; and with this tongue Confess Unto Salvation and with Chearfull Face Whose Colour Changd not, did the fire embrace. 308About the Eight of June the nineteenth yeare Of Diaclesian, brave Procopius were Beheaded first of all this solemn fray That fell in Palestines Cesaria Who when convert his Images of Gold And Silver brake and gave them (as its told) Unto the poore, was took and wrackt; and tore Gor'd, stabd, and fired, beheaded as before. About Novembers seventeenth the sword Zachius and Alpheus who were scourgd, Mangled with Razars, Wrackt and many dayes And nights had lain in Stocks tormenting wayes Whose legs were streatcht four holes asunder, here Beheaded for Christs glorious Gospell Deare. 309The following yeare Gaza thy Timothy Here for Christs Name was burnt tormentously. Agapius and Thecla made a prey To savage beasts to rend, devour, and slay. About the twenty second day (its plain) Of March Agapius as yet not slaine With Timolaus one of Pontus and One Dyonisius a Tripolitan And Romulus a Deacon of Christ flock At thee Diospolis, an holy Stock, Pausis and then two Alexanders came Here and beheaded were for Christs sweet name. 310The third year under Maximinus curst The holy Apphianus, who (forth burst Away first from his Pagan Father, who Was Governour of Lycia) in love to Gods holy Cause, and to Cesaria came, And when the President Urban by name Was sacrificing tooke him by the hand, Gravely admonisht him to understand: And not the true Gods leave to sacrifice To Divells. But oh (now) what Cruelties They treat him with. Like savage beasts, they rage, Thrash him with stripes, his feet in stocks they stage At distance great, the third day make their lash His face, neck, bones, and inward bowells pass. But when they saw his Faith still shine they swathe His feet in oyled flax, then fire to't gave Which ran all or'e his flesh, consum'd the same, Pierc'd to the very marrow, dripping came Like melted wax. Yet still he lives and shines With Patience. Then they him, by new designs After he three dayes more in prison lay And holds his faith, they heave him in the Sea, In which when they had sunk him suddenly A mighty storm arose and noyse in th'Sky Not onely ore the Sea, but land did make An Earthquake; which did make the City shake. The Sea tooke up the Martyres Corps, did lay It at the Cities Gates that selfe same day, Which was the fift of April, which sight All of Cesaria saw; I witness write. Edifius, Apphianus brother, who Stocks, Fetters, Mine pits too did undergo For Christ, went to the judge told him to's face Of's Filthy wicked shamefull acts in place, Was after many bitter torments cast At Alexandria i'th'Sea at last. About the time of Apphan's Tragedy, They take young Ulpian of Tyre and ty After most grievous Scourgings, with a Snake And Cur dog in a raw ox hide, then take And Cast him in the Sea in Cursed Spite Because he would adhere to Christ his Light. 312In yeare the fift the fift of April, The Virgin Theodosia, young, came still To visit those for Christ here at the bar They take and scourge untill their lashes jar Upon her bones through her pure milk white breasts, And sunk i'th'Sea, while patience her possest. Famous Domninus in the Faith expires, Leaving his body in tyrannick fires. Three more are sentenced to buckle, Just, And fight each others till they leave their dust. Auxentius grave and pious they display, To Wild and Cruell beast to rend and slay, And others, stout men grown, they geld and send Into the Quarries there their strength to spend. 313In year the Sixt an hundred wanting three From Porphyris in Thebes convay'd must bee Unto Firmillian the President Of Palestine, who with them's discontent, Because they will not Christ defie; Wherefore He doth with bodkins out their right eyes bore, Eye Apple, Lid and all; then seirs their holes With red hot seiring iron, then out them toles Saws off at knees with an hot burning Saw Their Left legs; then them damns to mines by law. And others then of Gaza thus are servd, Who from their Lord Christ Jesus never swarvd. Of whom one female took and scourge they do, Then with lasht sides tide on a tree for show. Whereat Valentia of Cesaria Did to the Judge out of the throng thus say How long dost wrack my sister cruelly? He boyld in anger, doth upon her fly Halls her to th'Altar there to sacrifice. She shoulderd it, stampt on it, it defies, Did over turn't, fire, Wood, and offring too. Hence she and the other in the fire they threw The same ninth day of August blessed Paul Had to the Scaffold doth the Head small call: For Leave to minde himselfe did of him crave Which gain'd, then with a clear loud voice he strave With God in prayre that's favour might befall And Peace and Liberty to Christians all, That Jew's and the Semaritans might fly To God through Christ converted savingly. That Nations all in Errour Wallowing Might barked in Christ fold, be brought from Sin: And for the Silly Croud that did him round Yea for his Judge and Emperour yea found A heart to pray for's Executioner That this Vile hainous Crime of bloody war Might not be laid unto their Charge, hence sprung A leake of teares up in their Eyes that run. All weep and sob: but he then on the block His head laid meekly down; they off it chop. Anthony and Zebinas a Choice pair Of thine Eleutheropoliss now are Beheaded with German the thirteenth day Thus of November; Annathas they pay With Scourges sadly through Cesaria, Then burn alive. They wretchedly permit The bodies dead no graves (although most fit) But in a dolefull sight they scatter'd ly About the town and in the fields, and by The Wayes; here lies an head or skull, or Arm, There lies a Trunck, back, Leg, Thigh bowells warm. Some beasts or Swine, Dogs, Foules of heaven knaw Some rotting ly, Oh! when will hard hearts thaw? âAnd while this thing went thus, the skies most cleare âThe Pillars of the City did shed tears âThe Market place and street bedewd their Cheeks âWith trickling Tears at this sad sight they weep, So that forthwith this rumour round did fly The Earth now could not beare this Villany Of these sad days, nor sensless stones i'th'wall: But at this Wickedness do weeping fall. About the fourteenth of December fell At Ascalon by fire blown up by hell One Ares, and by the beheading Toole Elias, Promus too all of Christs Schoole In Egypt who were taken as they went Into Cicilia to visit Saints there sent And Peter Apselam whom here behold, Was tride by fire and found like most pure gold With whom Asclepius burnd (a Marcionite) 'Bout January's thirteenth day down quite. About now Februaries seventeenth day Twelve martyred were here at Cesaria Valens the Deacon of Jerusalem A mighty man in scripture sufferd then Paul too of Jamnia of precious fame And five Egyptians took as back they came From compan'ing the Martyres who were sent To the Cicilian mine-pit-banishment Who sorely scourgd some seemd as if they'd lost The sense of feeling, afterwards it Cost Them all their heads, Pomphilus that brave man Was now beheaded by Firmillian On whom when that the Judge his sentence gave His pupill Porphyry aloud did Crave His Masters Corps, and others when quite dead That in their graves they might be buried. Whereat the Judge when that he had him found Most firmly in the Faith of Christ abound, Did Charge the Scourge should pass unto the bones And in his innard bowells. (Hearts like Stones!) Which done and Porphyry as one that felt No pain, not shrinking nor speake he in a pelt, Chargd them to burn him in a slow slow fire, Whereto in Philosophicall attire His little Cloake on's shoulders in such wise He went according to his former guise And with a Cheerfull looks he did abide The fire about him which he in each side Suckt in by ery breath he fetcht, and when It ceized on him strongly thus pray'd then Thou Jesus, son of God, me help and aide. Thus bravly he his life for Christ down laid. Pamphilus this was made to understand By one Choice Souldier of the Roman band Seleucus nam'd who fatherly tooke Care Of Martyres Orphans and their Widdows rare An holy Christian, now he's tooke and led Unto his judge, is judgd, and lost his head. Theodulus a grave and Zealous man (Yet of the house of Judge Firmilian) A Sharer in Seleucus' fate is brought To plead his case which they account all naught; Before his master who more furious is With him than others, is Condem'd for this And firmly in his Saviours Cause did bide And for him willingly was Crucifide. Then Julian a Cappadocian Of holy life a much inspired man, With Gods own Spirit as he came along Heard of these holy martyres and grew strong And seing of their bodies on the ground Embract and did salute them, hence he's found, Brought to the judge, Condemn'd and burnd in th'fire, Wherein tryumphantly he did expire. Thus twelve brave Christian Champions in one day The martyres Crown won in Cesaria. Soon after Adrian and Eubulus Came far to visit saints here, tooke were thus Where after many torments they had born Are thrown to Wild beast to be rent and torn Then were beheaded, Adrian the fourth And Ma?the seventh Eubulus up store'th Whose blessed blood now up did lock the Doore Of martyredom, Cesaria hath no more. 314The seventh year that something ran more mild The mettall mine pit martyres for a while, Did flock together to attend Christs wayes But then the President his peepholes layes: Comes and disperses them to Cyprus some Some bide in Palestine and some must come To Libanus, be vext with toyling there Then Peleus and Nilus that once were Egyptian bishops, With a minister And Patermythius of Singular 315Respect for Christ are took and burnt because They would not Christ neglect to tend their laws. Others that were too old and Combersom Are set at liberty their work being done Mongst whom was John, th'Egyptian prompt Divine That could not see but would Christ truth outline Most gravely by the Scripture as if read. Sylvanus too another pious head Whom notwithstanding by a vile decree With thirty nine more in one day must be Beheaded last of all in Palestine Brought up the reare of Martyres at the mine. But now to pass from Palestine, we finde Sylvanus Pastor at Emisa shin'd Now cast unto Wild Beasts with many more Tyrannion Pastor of Christs flock more ore At Tyre sunk in the Seas proud waves beside Zenobius Zidons Choice one now is much try'd Both Minister and expert Artist there In Physick scourgd and di'de for Christ his Deare. Melitus and so Syria did smart Their Pastors, Elders Deacons all must part And are in prison cast, no roome is there For Roagues and Rascalls left; they've better Cheer. In Pontus Cruelties extremly rise To heare most horrible and tyrant wise. Some have sharp things run up their tender nails, The Backs of others melted lead assails Pourd all thereon. Some's needfull members maimd, Some in their privy members have sustaind Such horrid and such shamefull tortures there Whose mention suites not any modest eare. Left legs hewn of[f] at knee with burning sa? Right eyes pickt out with bodkins by their pa? But come we now to Antioch and see What burnings, butcherings of saints there bee For to be red in blood red dress infoild Torments so terrible that many spoild Therewith so sadly that to shun the same Made many headlong cast themselves amain From house's tops to end themselves outright To shun these Tyranies of wicked Might An Noble famous Vertuous Lady grave With her two Beautious daughters Virgins brave Yet Vertuous, the town avoided but Are sought for, found, fetch back by souldiers put To feare not only tortures but that they Should be abused in a lustfull way, The which to shun they in the river lept And sunck themselves while th'guard did them neglect. Two other sisters of a noble blood Renowned Virgins of a life Choice good Of pregnant beauty, tender years, they hoist And Cast into the Sea for Jesus Christ. Romanus Deacon of Cesaria's Church At Antioch when Sorrows tooke its porch Bravely exorted Christians for Christ name Manfully to behave themselves. Hence came This Counsell gi'n unto the Tyrants eare Ceizd him and by his gods swear to him there He'd make him smart for't and gave charge that he Should up be trust and's bowells drawn out bee. Not so quoth Officers, we mayn't do so. This man's of noble Parentage. Then go Whip him with lashes wearing knops of lead Under the which he songs of praise displayd And when the raged Tyrant had made Wide And deep Cuts gasht with lancets in his Sides Had dasht his teeth out, tore his Cheeks, he said I thanke thee Captain, thou more mouths hast made Mee thus to preach my Lord and Saviour Christ. How many wounds, so many mouths be voic't. And when the Tyrant said with scorn abroad, Thy hanged Christ is but a last night God He to him Christs eternity displayd: Call me a seven yeare Child he also said And hearken what he'l say. One being brought Tell me my little babe, quoth he, thy thought. Should we one Christ and in One Christ the father Or should we many Gods adore the rather? To which the Child, one God in Christ, repli'de. Whereto the Tyrant, then thou Villain Cride, Who learnd thee this? my mother quoth [the] lad Wherefore she's calld, This villain, horse, he bad: They scourgd him till beholders Cheeks were wet. The mother Comforts him, Child don't forget Young Isaac who his Fathers knife yields to Pledge Bethlem's babes now in this Cup also. They pluck the hair and skin of from his Crown. Christ will thee Crown (Quoth shee) with bright renown. The Tyrant being tir'd, at last behead The Child, Romanus then is strangled. Now Lucian Minister and Cyprian Who was at first a Vile Marcian Or Filthy Sorcerer be'st won to Christ Then Deacon of the Church, after that Priest Then Bishop of this Church of Antioch Justina too dies by the Tyrants stroke Arabia her Martyres doth present To Christ also as her rich Ornament. Again else where, nay at Sebastia Forty brave flourishing youthfull Souldiers lay All friezing in a pond of Watills till The morning came, and then alive as still They're taken out all frozen stiffe and Cast Into the fire and burnt for Christ at last. (This or one instance of such fact was wrought Under Licinius as some have taught) After whose deaths, their pious wives are tai'n And sent with Deacon Amones ore the main Unto Heraclea in Thrace and there With grieveous tortures they all murdered were. He slew the Learned guides of Churches, and Did raze their Temples even with the land, In Pontus; and imprisond others some Forbiding all that with good visits come. His Officers did many Bishops slay And cut their bodies into gobbits, nay, As pieces in a butchers shambles small, Then after this fed sea fish with the mall. He Theodorus Crucifid then strikes Nails in his Armpits, then his head off smites. Another Theodore bishop of Tyre A third a man of Perga; and goes higher Then Basilus Amason's bishop thus And Nich'laus bishop too of Mirorus And Gregory he of Armenia falls By him, and at Neocesaria Paul. But now its time to pass from Asia, To see the havock made in Africa. African Martyres In Affrica no pen with inke can shew The Cruelties Gods Saints did undergoe Their bodies were with shells to pieces torn Women had one leg tide and then in scorn Hoist up on high, their heads hung downward then For an uncomely, Cruell sight to men. Strong boughs of boistrous trees by Engins bowd Their martyres legs unto the same they Crowd And tide, then on a sudden let them fly And rend them do and take their limbs on high, Which cruelties for many years were such By tens, by twenties, thirties (nay its much) By sixties and by hunderds oft they slay Men Women Children tortur'd in a day. Some burnt, some were beheaded; yet some in Step out at bar as other's sentenc'd, sing And tune forth Psalms of praise and this did last In their sharp tortures till their dying gasp. Some had their soft Ears board, their Nostrills slit, Their Hands cut off, joynts outed, Limbs off split, Their bodies torn to pieces, some by law Have left legs sawn of by a burning saw, Their right Eyes by a bodkin dug out, and Their holes seerd then they're to the Mine pits damnd. Here now at Alexandria forth is brought The Noble Philoramus by Christ taught, The City Governour in place of trust In weighty Matters of the Empire just In Roman honours guarded in such strain With a brave troop of souldiers for his train. Now leaves his honours, Riches, Wife and babes And all Entreaties of such things; and wades To Christ his Onely Wealth, Joy, Glory bright In blood, Whose head they With the sword off smite. Now Phileas Bishop of Thmuis who Was famous for Politick Rule also Had oversight of Publick Liturgies And Philosophick Studies dies. Nylus and Peleus Who bishops were In Egypt were burnt down to ashes there. Hysechius, Pachamy, Theodore In Egypt also bishops and more ore Peter the bishop of Christs Church that shone At Alexandria whose fame's well known For Piety and Patern to Christs flock And Shephards too, and with him of this stock Faustus Ammonius, and Didius Choice ministers and full three hundred thus Were slain with axes for Christs Gospell sake. Oh Egypt how doth this thee glorious make? Menas who was of Egypts souldiery Did shew himselfe in Christian Chavilry Most expert and in tortures thus declar'd There's nothing in my minde may be compar'd With heavens kingdom, nor can all the World Be worth one Soule, if in the balance hurld. Who can us from our Lord Christs Love ere part? Shall Anguish or distress? I've learnd by heart Of my Dear Lord and King, not such to feare Who can't th'Soule, though may kill th'body here. And when as being judgd, at block he was His heart arose and thus his praises up pass I thanke thee do my Lord God who hast mee Partaker of thy pretius death made bee, And hast not me devoured by fierce foes But constantly in thy Pure Faith repose Myselfe to this my latter end which said He yields himselfe and off they strike his head. Antino did her Christian Souldiers give To Martyredom eternally to live Ascla Philemon Apolonius Amongst the rest were executed thus. And thus this Cruelty did overflow All Egypt, Thebes, and Lybia also And Mauritania did feel this smart That drove her pretious spirits from her heart. It ran into the Ilands. Samus ile Were lanced by it for a while And Sicily had Eighty martyr'd in't Excepting one did deeply of it drinke. But now my Pinace is at Sea. I'le steer To Europe brave to see what times were there. The Martyres of Europe There martyr'd at Nicopolis in Thrace Choice Saints, yet handled in a dismall Case. At Athens Monas play'd the Christians part With bravery in all his torments sharp. So did Euyraphus, whence Gods Grace did ceaze On Athens, President Hermogenes, And brings him home to Christ in such degree That pledg them in their Martyres-Cap did hee. Anysia of Thelsalonica Of Christian Parents the rood people slay. Quirinus Silcia's bishop in the higher Hungaria, is apprehended and brought nigher Unto the touch of Faith, Where he did shine As pollished with wealthy Grace divine, Is from the bridge into the river thrown Fixt 'bout his neck to sinke him a greate stone, Where floting long, he did the folk bid think Not you of feare hereat: at length did sink. Now Italy doth meet this bloody stroke And findes the burden of these Tyrants yoak Venice doth seale Christs Cause with martyres blood In Aquileia out the Edict stood For all as Would the Christian then to slay. Felices now with Fortunatus they Destroyed there. This Dismall day ore spred Florence and Pergamus and Naples had A Stroke then gi'n: and at Campania And Benevent Apul-Venusia And Tuscany this Persecution ran. And tortur'd greatly many a gracious man. Then Barbara the Tuscan Virgin brave A glorious proofe of Christian Valour gave When after sorrows in a stincking jayle They slash her nerves and did her sides assaile With flaming Tapers, tortures manifold, She was beheaded like refined gold. Agnes a Roman Damsell touching whom Unto our eares incredibles do come Well passed by therefore, is brought unto The block for Christ, and off her head doth go. An Apuleian Bishop now is caught Adauct, and January, Elders brought With Septimus and Fortunatus there And at Venusia all martyr'd were. There martyr'd were at Rome one Claudius Serinus too, also Antonius With Marcelline a Roman bishop who Among the throng of Martyres thus doth show Chrysogonus the pious Tutor were Of Anastasia who did appeare Adornd with Piety, who, when he fell By Martyredom, her Zeale strove to Excell At Aquileia gaind the Martyres Crown Where martyr'd were these maids of bright renown, Agapee, Irenee, Chiona, and Theodora before with holy hand. At Rome Arthemius that kept the jayle Where Martyres were, Converted was, doth sayle Along the torrent of blesst Martyrdome And to the King of Glory this may run, A Deacon of the Church of Rome is said Under Marcellus bishop this sea made. But to attempt the Spanish Continent We'st finde Choice Saints to Heaven this way went. At Valence Felix who the Elder was And Fortunatus, as it come to pass, And so Achilleus Deacons choice do dy By Martyredome for Christianity. Capophorus a Tuscan Elder and Abundus Deacon at Spoleto stand For Christ Choice Martyres and at Barcino Is Cucusatus martyred also. Cesaraugusta Eighteen at a time Brings out to martyredome for truth divine. Innumerable other martyres fall By Dacian the President, and all The Spanish Coast he sprinckles with their blood As if their slaughter was a thing most good, Leucadia the Virgin forth doth come At Toledo unto her Martyredom In Portugall at that brave City nam'd There Einerita, by Eulalia tam'd Who of Choice Noble Parents there was born By Grace New born, and hence an holy Scorn At twelve years old rose in her of all ways Of Paganry prevailing in these dayes. Greate honourable Matches she refusd Having her Soule espousd to Christ, she usd No Courtly dalliance, no pleasure tooke In Purple robes nor gorgious Dress did brook, Nor Pretious balms, nor costly Jewell, Rings Of Wealthy gold or any am'rous things, But all for Christ she was and Zeale did show. Her parents hence lest she should guilty grow Of her own blood convayd her out of town Unto their Contry house far from the frown Of bloody Catchpoles, but her spirits thus Mewd up seems as a stiffling to them flush. Hence in the night though darke she gets away O're hedge and ditch through briars and brambles nay Without all Path she strikes out to the town And to it came by that they dark went down. And in the morn goes to the judgement seate And with a manly voice doth them thus treate. What shame, I pray, that you men souls undoe, And 'gainst the Rock their bodies living throw, And make them God Omnipotent deny? Behold I am a Christian, Enemy, Unto your Divell-Sacrifices, yea, And spurn your idols with my feet away. I God Confess with heart and mouth but say Isis, Apollo, Venus, What are they? And what is Maiminus too? the One A thing of nought. The other is well known. A Reprobate, who doth the same adore Both frivilous, not to be prizd therefore. Goe too, thou Hangman born, cut, mangle all These earthly parts, breake down this brittle Wall: Its easly done, but yet the Inward part Thou shalt not hurt by any of thy art. Whereat the Judge inrag'd, cries, Hangman, take her Hence hall her by the hair out, torments make her Unto the Uttmost, let her feel this hour, Of Country Gods and of Imperiall power. But oh thou sturdy girle, or ere thou dy Revoke they Wickedness. Thy Progeny And noble Kindred waile thy overthrow. What wilt thou kill thyselfe a young flower so? Doth not the glistring golden pomp out spred Now of the Bride bed moove thee? Childish head! Behold Deaths Furniture here ready laid Either thou'st by this Sword be headless made Or by these beast be torn in pieces soon Or flame shall thee to ashes quite Consume. Let Salt and Incense in the Censer fall And thou shall stay these punishments ? Whereat she mov'd, spits in the Tyrants face Throws down the idolls, spurns them in disgrace,. The heap of Incense, Then without delay The Hangmen hall her by strong hand away Pluck joynt from joynt, and Claw her tender sides Unto the bones with tallons, yet she 'bides Sings songs of praise to God thus Lord behold Ile not forget thee. What joyes manifold Is it to eye thy Tryumphs, Victories, Oh Christ to gain to these high Dignities? And still she calls upon that holy name All in her own blood brewd, that did her stain: Not weeping but with merry looks she stands Her red blood dies her milke white skin and hands. They goard her mangled flesh on th'iron Grate And Hurdle, and it harrow, then they take And burn her sides and breasts with Candle flame Which by her hair ran ore her, till death came. At Adula Sabrina martyre's made Christina too Vincentrice also's said By some there to be martyred although Others aver it was at Valence, who Being a Levit and a Deacon was By Dacian tormented thus alass! He stretch him on the Eculean Fram And thus Out Wrackt he torturd with the pain Of Diverse Wounds, and wounded thus he runs And tares his wounded flesh with raking Combs. And drives the Executioners with Stripes To greater Cruelty in all their Wipes His harrowd body on the gridiron laid With iron tenter hooks he open made And clapt there to red burning plates ?orn And did these wounds with burning salt be corn. Then threw him in a dreadfull Prison so On Shells most sharp his legs in stocks doth throw And thus without all humane Confort he Lies thus, and being dead the Seas must bee His bury holy; but Vincent is humane And he by these as Victor overcame. But pass we now the Pyren-Hills to France And see that Martyre that the Truth Advance Much slaughter needs must be within the Same If we but weigh how Maximinian came Unto Marselles and Decrees proclaim'd That all should worship idols or be bain'd And hence the Noble Souldier Victor old Because no idoll Gods he Worship would Is by the Tyrant butcherd at Millain And Lucian too at Belvack is there slain Sebastian Lieutenant Generall Of Dioclessians Vangard on did Call The Martyres to be Constant to the Faith Is apprehended and this Wage he hath Gi'n by the Tyrant that his souldiers stick Him full of arrows, and in sinck him kick With whom Nicantrate and Zoe's spouse Did fall, and Traglin (oh the scowling brows) Tranquillines and Martia his Wife Claud, Castor, and Tibertius in this strife, Castellus Marcus and one Marcelline With many more were martyrd at that time And at Triders there Rectionarius playes His game so well: so many Christians slayes That there did run such streams of Pretious blood As dide greate Rivers red with this red flood. And out he did such Cursed orders send That wheresoere they any Christians kend They should fall on forthwith and slay them so Without all further orders thereunto. And also did it rage o'th'German Cost For neer to Colen Gordon and his host Above three hundred souls all martyr'd were Agrippina and Augustina fell there. Agricola and so Vitalis come To Bulloign, thirsting after Martyrdome, Vitalis first they handle wily doe And him enveagle's faith to overthrow, Which when they Could not then their rage aspires And doth attempt with tortures him to tire In which he faithfully attends Christ name And dies by martyredom with glorious fame. Agricola his Master now they treate Whose Candid Life seems for to dint some feat Upon them that they seem but slow to spill His blood, and hence they him delay untill He did provoke them not to make delay But to dispatch the matter hence they slay, But to conclude Brave Maurice now is brought From Syria and's Thebane Legion fraught With Christian piety, Maximian The Emperour did call them, ery man, Against the Reballs in pretence: they Come Through Rome, Macellus, bishop before in Spain Did strengthen them, they take an oath that they Would dy before deny their Faith or slay The Christians. Hence over the Alps they go After the Emperour to France unto The Agaun Downs that is by Rhone strong streams The Emperour at Ottodor there means To make his West and Eastern souldiers all With him up on his idoll Worship fall. Orders this thing, sends for his Theban host To serve his gods and Christian foes d? host They do refuse to Come to Ottodor To worship thus, nor will their swords begore With Christian blood; the Tyrant mad doth then Take out each tenth and doth bebutcher them. Hence Maurice brave doth besteel the rest With pious Exhortations t'yield their breast Unto the sword, and neck unto the stroke Rather than Christians slay or faith revoke, Doth tell the Emperour they swords on put To fight for justice, and the foes off cut Of all the Empire and of justice they Were Christian, said, and could not ?y Nor worship divell-idolls. Hence in rage He tithes them as before then doth engage Them all with horse and foot, and on do fall To hack and hew; they throw their arms down all Fall on their knees while them the others flay Who are as lambs most vilely made away And thus this Christian Legion slaine fall Sixty six hundred sixty six in all. English Martyres We'l saile the Brittish seas and England search And view what flowers of hers before Christs porch Do strewed lie, as shining ornaments Whose fragrant spirits breath perfumed sents And here we have Alban of Verulam The first in Brittain of Christ martyres ran Whom while a Pagan had a visit gi'n By one Amphibolus that did step in From France to shun the Persecution there Brought with him gospell pay for all his Cheere And lodging here with Alban did receive Food for the Flesh, for which he soule food gave. Alban Converted is to Christ hereby And when the Tyrant did the guest espy, He sends to fetch him, Alban then drew neer Did in Amphibolus his Robe appeare. Whereat the judge offended storms as hee Stood by his Altar of Idolatrie Did threaten him that he should beare the pain The other, should if he clave to Christ name And said to Alban of what Discent art thou? To whom he said What's that to you? Yet now I am a Christian and live Christianly Whereto the judge said, What's thy Name? Discry. He then replid my Parents did me name Albanus, and I honour do mentain Unto the true and living God. Wherefore The furious Judges Choler then boyled ore And chargd him now if live he would, to 'dore And hast to offer sacrifice. Whereto Alban replid, these Offerings you do To Divells that can neither help, nor hear Their Supplicants, but such as do them feare Shall once in hell eternall torments finde Unless they do repent and change their minde. This cut the Cruell judge unto the Quick Hence he the Whippers charge this saint to whip Which cruell Usage when he patiently sustaind With joy he was beheaded, and life gaind. And at that time Aaron and Julius there At Verulam with Alban martyred were. Amphibolus though he to Wales did fly To Wales was fet thence with a rage full high To Verulam, and martyr'd is, as't said Having his belly open ript, is made ? round a stake till out his bowells all Fell out, then stokd with Dagger, then they fall To stone him till he's ston'd to death, indeed Thus did this holy Worthy martyre speed. And now as stories goe this Cruell hand Slew well nigh all the Christians of the Land. Some few Omission added One Victor was at Xanthus for Christ name With eighteen score more worthy Christians slain. The Holy man Cassianus Pastor chiefe At Brixia di'd, but fell by this sharp griefe For being now betrusted with a Schoole He did apply himselfe thereto and rule Comily-Forum is the place he's at. The Tyrant hearing of it, as he sat In judgment: treats him and Condemns him too To be bemartyred by his Schollar so He's given to them to attend their Will And pleasure with, so be they do him kill. They handle him full sadly, some with pens New sharpned, some with their Pensills, stems Of Quills, With Penknives, Rulers, plumets and Such Childish things as are in Schooleboyes hands That give him many scars and smarting wounds So that his torment mightily abounds The greater boyes that stronger were did come And lay at him but yet the time was long Wherein his smart and scornfull scoffs did rise, From such as were malicious arch schoole boyes. But on it goes untill grim death doth seise Upon him in this wise and gives him ease. The Noble brave Barlaam out doth come All torments suffers in his Martyredome With an Heroick bravery untill At point of Death, and yet he never will Let any Crumb of truth have any wrong Wherefore they take and lay him all along Upon their idolls Altar and do put Fire and some Incense in's right hand and shut They do the same concluding that the flame Would make his hand to ope that from the same The Frankincense might on the altar fall As sacrificd, but were deceivd withall For loe the fire eate round his hand, untill It as with ashes cover'd were, yet still He held the Incense, and sung thus outright Blesst be my God that learns my hand to fight And thus upon the Divells Altar lies He and is burnt to God in Sacrifice. Let now the noble Catherine who was A Virgin brave of Alexandria pass Among these Martyres, who upon a day When many Christians were compelld to stay At Idoll Offrings in their sight in th'place She groand for griefe, and did unto the face Maxentius the Emperour withstand, And did rebuke him for his Cruell hand. Hence she is cast into the jayle, it's said, An Angell came that night to her convay'd Sweet Comfort to her. But the Tyrant flings Her on th'Eculeon Wrack, and also brings Her to his four sharp cuting Wheeles by's word And after that beheads her with a Sword. Now come we to Julitta, who out came Unto the judges then, and did complain Of some one mighty muckworm that had flown Upon her state, Land, Village, Stock, Slaves known To be all hers, as his by violence Whereto the Churle thus pleaded in defence. She outlawd was because she would not serve Th'Imperiall Gods nor would from Christ back swarve This plea's thought good, hence Fire and Incense's brought She Offer must, and Christ deny, or sought Relief in vain, Whereto she doth reply With Valeat Vita, Valeant Opes, aye Oh, farewell Life, farewell my riches all I'le part with these rather then let words fall Against my God Creator, and when prest By friends to Change her minde she did detest Their motion. Hence the wicked judge in ire Doth sentence give she must be burnt with fire. Whereto with Chearfull Spirit out she goe And did exhort the Women strong to grow, They of mans flesh were made, not weake to be But of his bone to be as strong as hee. Be weary of your lives in darkness led And fall in Love, with my Lord Christ and head. Perswade yourselve, nay Gods good Spirit do't, That there's a world to come and do you know't All Idoll Worshipers for ever shall Tormented be, but then Gods Servants all Shall Crown'd in glory be eternally Then lept she in the fire immediatly. Nay once for all its said that that sad fray In its assails under some tyrants slay Within a month full sev'nteen thousand and Vast multitudes unto the mine pits damnd. When Dioclesian had his fury spent And Maximinians venom out had vent The Empire voiding them as Excrements Constantius who alone himselfe Contents With England France, and Spain; lets Italy Go with the rest, then of the Monarchy To Maximinus Emperour i'th'East Who did his sons then two indeed invest As Cesars, Called Maximinus, one The other nam'd Severus as was known. Constantius then made Constantine his son His Cesar too, as Maximine had done. The Roman Souldiers then Maxentius made The Emperour, Maximians Son, its said, 'Gainst whom Severus was from Asia Sent by his Father but fell in the fray. Hence Maximinus in his place did make The Dane Licinius Cesar, these up take The patronage of Divell Worship all (Constantius and his son excepted) fall Upon Christs flock untill by Constantine They were Destroy'd, and Gospell grace did shine Which when it did a filthy fog soon rose That did the Sun of Righteousness oppose Hence such hard Cracks with Flashes out oft broke That many holy ones fell by this Stroake. Patience Exercised under Arianism While Alexander was a making Cleare Christs Godhead as Eternall in the Sphere O'th'Church at Alexandria Unto The Priests their of andanor up did grow Put up in Arius his Sophick Crown The which he crops by which he tumbles down Christs Choice Eternity, him Creature names Sucks in absurdities such falshood gains That God was God when that he had no Sin The Son was made, and therefore once begun Was but a Son Adoptive, not by nature Was made to be Gods Instrument-Creatour. He was not God, had not a Deity The Holy Ghost according to this lie He did traduce as but a Creature made, And from the father and the son is said Essentially to Differ, and such trash This Spermalogue did vend with Currant pass. The Nicene Counsill then was summoned By Constantine this Hydra to behead The which they bravely did: yet as a weed That off is cropt, springs up again indeed Brancht into many stems, or sorts, doth grow Like to three headed Cerberus, and flow. The Eusebians, Eunomians, and them Call'd Macedoneans branch from this stem. This Monster barkt and bit, did spread and run All Affrick, Asia, Europe to did come Like as a Canker eating strangly spred In almost evry place its venom head Where Gospell grace did flow, in Ministers In Kings and Magistrates in Emperours And strangly did inulcerate, infest The Churchs, and the pious part molest. Arian Persecution Greate Constantine that bore th'Imperiall Mace 341Thirty one yeares and closed up his race At Helenople's in a sheet of gold Wownd up, laid in a golden Coffer t'hold His Clay, the two and twenti'th day of May They to th'Apostles Church he built, Convay, Constantinople's graced with, and in The Tomb he did prepare they bury him The twelve Apostles figur'd that abide On this side't six six on the other Side. His Empire falls unto his Children three Spain, France and Britain, Constantine, to thee. Illyrick. Italy and Africk to His youngest Son calld Constans now doth goe But Greece with Thrace and all the Orient Unto the other, nam'd Constantius, went Who like a Spunge suckt in the Arian Wash Become a Whipstock with that hellish lash That Scurges to the quick the Orthodox The maule that many of the Saints down knock When Constantine his younger brother sent Back Athenatius from his Banishment By Arian Wiles effected formerly And now a new fomented, by and by He Syrian sent Lieuetenant of his host To Alexandria to cleare the Coast By force of him and then he did surrounde The Temple with his army where he found This Athenatius with his Church although In singing time he slip him, and did go Again to Rome. Yet Syrian with his mates Did play this Arian game at Cruell rates Some butcherd are, some troden under feet, Some wounded fall, many the prisons meet, Many are banished, nay Women cought Drawn by their hair to judgment seats and brought In most disgrace full way, and did begrace Their Gregory with Athanasius place. The which the folk so badly beare they turn And Dianysius house to ashes burn. These Arian blades go on the bishops they Through out all Egypt take and (se their play) Some Whip with rods; some hard bands they binde Some banisht are, we ninety bishops finde Are drove from Egypt, and from Lybia By Arians persecution away. And sixteen more are Excild in sad Cases One Potamon that in the Pagan Woe Had one Eye dug out, they now scourg, and throw Him out as dead, and though means usd he 'gain Reviv'd, yet dide soon by their stripes, and pain. A bishops aunt killd by their tortures they Let none interr, unburi'd cast away, Three thousand souldiers in a Temple rush And cruelly women and Children Crush, Distroying many: yea, they Virgins take And strip them naked, and the bodies make An Object unto all unburi'de ly As food for Dogs, who by their scourgings dy. At other places as Constantinople This rage was greate Wherewith thy strove to hopple Christ Flock with Macedonius the Vile And Paul the Bishop there's sent in Exile Which when the City saw by Warlike might This Macedonius brought, they stopt up quite The Passages forbad his entrance then 345The Souldiers with Swords drawn three thousand men Slew and three fifties too and trod them down. Such was the tragedy at this brave town. But Constans by Magnentias being slain In France who did Constantius' rage restrain A little Space, he lets then play the Rex Vile Macedonius, who thus did vex Christs glorious Cause that such as Orthodox Abode in Faith, Out of the Church he locks Compelling them unto their sect likewise As Pagans use to idol sacrifice They scourgd to death a many, did deprive Some of their Freedoms, some of states they shrive Brand some ith forehead, and all sorts of pain That shamefull are, they make them to sustain Some di'de in torment, others are exild These things ran ery where, thus Saints are spoild; Constantius doth grant Macedonius To wast the Orthodox assemblies thus: Hence he doth leavell to the very land Their Temples by a military hand Some that refuse for to Comunicate He with intolerable pains doth rate, Doth ope their mouth with sticks and opend so Put in the sacred Mysteries (strange shew) If any did refuse immediately Whips, Bonds, and Jayles and other griefes he'd try If women did refuse, he off their breasts Would Cut, presst hard upon their tender Chests, Or else would burn with red hot iron in part Or else with rosted Eggs t'increase the Smart. In Paphligonia at Mantinum This Cursed Macedonius made run Four bands of Souldiers who did cruely Destroy a many, that his faith did fly. Sebastian the Captain of the Host A wicked Manichee who many Coasts Swept of their Pious Guides did greatly flesh George Cappadox his barbarous Savageness Whom then he did declare for to succeed Choice Athanasius, then he did proceed With Philagry, Egypts Lieuetenent strong Set Jews and Pagans, Christians thus to wrong Burnt up the Churches and Baptisteries They did, and did most horrid villanies. They holy undefiled virgins set Starke naked, and if any hereat fret And this withstood, they hazzerdeth their head The saints they vilely underfoot did tread, Some are Confiscate, others too are slain With Clubs or Swords, some wounded, scourgd, sustain Revilings and they now come and display On the Communion Tables (Oh sad day) Such birds and Nuts of Pines they offer do And bring their Idolls forth with lauds also Reproach and shamefull words they also hoist Against our Lord, and Saviour Jesus Christ Did burn the holy books of Scriptures which They in the Churches found divinely rich Athe'stick Pagans and Christ-Cutthroate Jews The Sacred Baptistry entring, abuse Oh horrid! On their naked bodies dint That filthiness of Words and deeds in print That is abominable, and we hold A thing too shamefull for us to be told. This splendid Georgeous George thus entring in Greatly begladed at these Wicked things And distributing hire and pay unto Both Jews and Pagans and all such men who Attended him therein, he gave them all The Church for prey and booty, on't they fall. Hence on they fall and do the Church divest Of all her treasure that she then possest, Wine, Oyle, her Candlesticks, upon the Wall, Her Papers now which to their Idolls fall, But oh! these Arian Villanies are more Than can be pend, my pen here stops therefore. But while the things ran thus God was not still For Julian who in France even to his Will When he had vanquished the enemy, Was by the Souldiery rebelliously Made Emperour. Whereat Constantius rose With griefe his Cousin german to oppose And of Euzoius now he was baptizd And going out to war was soon surprizd By Death the tentend of an Apoplex. 365Hence Julian soon to the throne out steps, Calls home the banished Comandes that none Should offer unto any Christian wrong. But all was done in curld hypocrisy For from the same he fled to Paganry He calls the Christians Galilean brats Whom he forbad to trace Poetick plats, Or read Philosophy, and gave out then This reason, said they wound us with our pens. They armed with our Weapons do us fight Hence he forbad them Learning gainst all right But did his Pagan worship stuff with all The Christian Worships Modes, Acts, Rites they fall Upon't, thereby to make it better pass And guided Temples raisd up for it was. He judgd he must abstain from Tortures and Must take of Christians by another hand Hence did forbid them learning and displace Them from all arms and office in disgrace, But yet he did purse persecution raise Oppressing them in all unrighteous wayes And when his Leeches did exceed his laws That brought complaints to him upon that cause He scoffing thence would say be ye Content You are to beare, tis our Gods Commandement. He forct the Church of Cesaria And round about there all their Wealth to lay And many at his feet three hundred pounds Of Gold then to his Coffers up went round The laws of Constantine he did outlaw That freed the Clergy from all rates, did claw Them now, and did all Christain Temples stroy And on their Wealthy Ornaments did fly Most Costly Consecrated gifts he took At Antioch Theodorit did looke Unto these Vessells whom he scourgd away And though an Elder with the sword did slay. He gave to villains all full liberty To treate the Christians then most shamefully By style then of Impunity. Hence they Surprize Gods ministers and Women slay At Ascalon and Gaza, rip up, make Their bellies Hogs Troughs and do barly take And fill their bellies with, then swine they bring Which to their pleasure great do eate therein At Gaza on they go, scourge some to death Drag some up on their backs, some while they've breath Upon their faces on the ground and dash Against the Pavements others all to mash: Beate some with stones and staves, and some wash ore With boiling Water, some on stakes, spits gore. The heads of some they dash to pieces till Their brains drop out, and then again they drill Them to the places where dead Corp are laid And burn them in their fires which there they made And then their bones they gather up and fling With Asses and with Camells bones therein To mingle them, that none may ever say These are the good mens bones so made away. At Heliople Deacon Cyrill who In Constantine's bright day did overthrow The Idolls there, the Pagans, kill, up rip His belly, and his Liver knaw. Like trick Thse did who did the virgins naked set A gazing stock to be, then did not let To hack them into bits, then out them cast To be devourd by hogs, cause in dayes past Brave Constantine had Venus Temple there Destroy'd wherein virgins deflored were. At Arethusa, Mark, an Elder who In Constantine's blesst dayes did overthrow Their Idols Temple now they take, strip, beate And tare him all with stripes which they repeate, They tumble him in stincking sincks, then drag Him thence and set him out to boyes to gag With Pensills sharp, then at the last him plac'd Up in a Basket, all besmeard and trac'd With broth and hony out, they hang i'th'sun In ve'ment heat, for Bees and Wasps that hum. The Idoll Priest at Daphne a small boy Privatly trained up in piety Who fled to's Mistress then at Antioch And was Conceald, gave many bitter stroke Did bore his back, his hands, and feet also With red hot burning irons, and lockt him too Up in his bed room, and so left him there Yet God miraculously freed him here. The Wells at Daphne Julian did spoile With his Abominations, to beguile The folk who usd this Water in all food That of his Geer they might be understood To be Partakers with him in the same Which griev'd all Christian. Hence two souldiers came Who of his Guard were gentlemen calld thus, Maximianus and Juventius Much at a feast bewaile this villany Which by a Catch pole there did them descry Who being sent for, did up to his face Gravely reproove this fact of his, through grace For which they're tooke, and by most rugged pain And most intolerable griefs are slain. And they at Alexandria this Whip Do meet with cutting to the Very quick. An old deserted place where heretofore The Pagans sacrificed men great store To Mythra or the Sun Constantius gave Unto the Church: now Georgius would have It Cleansd of Rubbish, that he there might build A Temple. Hence all people there beheld The Pagan Villany, to their Disgrace, The Pagans moovd hereat, flew in their face Slew some with swords, With Clubs some, other some With stones, With roaps, some Crucifid, some come All wounded sadly. George they take and ty Unto a Camell, and burnt cruelly. In other towns they threw the Christian there Upon their Altars as burnt Offrings were. Amachius the President up raisd His Idolls in a Temple to be praisd In Phrygia's Metropolis, hence rush Theodulus and Macedonius And Tatian and privily them stroy Hence others taken are and like to dy Wherefore these men appear'd, said they it did. Hence all torments are tormented, Chid, And rosted on the gridiorn, Whence they spake With Valient Courage to him, on the Grate Wouldst thou eate roast meat, Amachy, turn first Us on the other side, lest that for rost We seem to be halfe raw unto thy tast And thus this doome they nobly embrac't. To these we'l joyn these martyres mentioned Artemus th'Egyptians souldiers head, Beheaded was. Donate Gramarian With both his Parents slain by Julian Donate Aretia's bishop, the bishop then Hilarian heir of Jerusalem Priscus a Roman Elder, and the Clark Priscillian Pigmenius a part And Gordian, two Johns and Paul who were Once Chamberlains to Constance daughter cleare Of Constantine, these Women too to wit Demetria, and Benedicta yet Were martyred all by Julian the Vile Who strove to press Christianity by guile When that at Daphne him Apollo told He could not answers give here as of old Because the Martyre Babylas had there His Sepulcher, and buri'd was too neer. He Charg'd the Christian then at Antioch To take the Martyres Coffine thence, who do't. And as they were a carrying him away They sung alowd, as Julian heard, this say, âConfounded be all those that worship do âCarv'd images, and trust on idols throw. Whence Julian in such a rage out brake He gave Comand they should all Christians take Imprison, and with Various torments smite, Yet none but Theodore met with this wipe. For his Lieutenant Salust did asswage The Emperour now in his Chafing rage. When to the Persian Wars he went he vowd The blood of Christians to his Gods allowd, When he returnd he would them persecute And Chargd to build a Teatre that suite This matter would thus at Jerusalem, Wherein he would to Wild beast cast out them. Libanius a sophist entred in A Schoole at Antioch which marke (the thing) A brave learnd Christian mannag'd did in scorn Stild master, and unto him spake forlorn Could not he tell What should at such a time The Cartpenters brave Son do? Now divine, To whom he said, he whom they scornfully The Son call of the Cartpenter, is high. He is the maker of the whole world, nay And now he hath prepar'd Sandapila. Soon after this news came that Julian Was slain and to Sandapila (Vile man) Convayed was, and paid is for his Scorns The proverb's true, Curst cows have oft short horns. The Arian Persecution by the Emperour Valens. 366Julian slain, Jovinianus reigns, A worthy Prince all piety mentains, Defends the Orthodox, on Arians frowns But was too good to live: glory him Crowns 368And in his place they Valentinian bring A worthy prince faithfull to Christ his King. He Chose his Colleague Valens his good brother, As yet appearing such, yet proov'd another. Sad persecutor of Christs Saints and Cause Whom to the Arians his Wife drew, Claws The Orthodox off when his brothers head Was laid, or hand was in the Western bed, For at his baptism Eudoxius made Him swear to Arianism, and (its said) To persecute them that the same oppose And hence he made the Orthodox as foes. But boyld thus raw, not Fish nor Flesh he prooves Gives leave for all, both Pagans and the Jews And Hereticks at Antioch their rites To Celebrate and that in open Sight. Hence Bacchus, Ceres, Jupiter again Revive their Worship (thank thee Valens, reign). He banisht such as would not then partake With his Euzoius, nor Communicate. Eusebius of Samosatis yea Pelagius of Laodicea Barse of Edessa and such are sent By him into a grieveous banishment. He punisht some by fines, by scourgings some Drowns many in Orantes that doth run By Antioch, nay eighty one Choice men Ecclesiasticks all came to him then At Nicomedia and bills display Before him of their Wrongs they underlay. Who all inragd and Chaft doth thus Command Modestus the Lieuetenent underhand To take and slay them all, Who is in fear This open act would raise an uproare there He ships them then seeming as if he would Exile them, but the seamen thus are told Convay them to the sea, then to your boate Then set the ship a fire and let it floate. And so they did, thus these Choice men at sea Are burned with the Ship and made away. And now he came to Antioch thus and Doth down destroyes Whom Arians do withstand. And now he goes forth to Edissagny A City in Mesopotamia As if to see Thomas his Temple there (But something else designed by him were) The people that in troops flock to the same, He knew no friends were to his Arian game. He gave's Lieutenent then a box o'th'eare And bad him slay all those that worshipt there Modestus slow did privily convay The matter, willing them t'omit next day. But this they will not. Now Modestus goes Unto the work, these sheep of Christ to pose, And as he goes a woman in her hand Having her Child did hast and brake his band He to her saith, thou silly woman where Art thou thus hasting? She replied there Where others are, saith he, dost not thou know That to their Death Modestus out must go. Yea Quoth the Woman, therefore thus run I. And why, saith he, dost take this little boy? That he may be with Martyres, she repli'd, Whereat amaizd, he back his Troop did guide, And did this Emperour this matter show And did perswade him from their overthrow. But oh! the Tyranny that did invade The Alexandians when once was laid Choice Athanasius' head Under the hand Of Lucius the Arian Bishop, and Palladius the Pagan, Pretor there, Who both in wicked Cruelty gulpht were. What Rapine, Murder, Paganry, What Cries By Tyrants there, the Eares would dread the noyse. He that desires to heare the same may find The same Theodoret for all hath lin'd. But to Conclude this Wicked Arian Prince To seek unto the Divell doth not mince, Who should succeed him, and the Crafty ape Doth answer him THEOD. and lets him gape To catch the man and meaning of the same. But now this bloody Valens void of shame Commands all to be slain whose name begin With Theod hoping to prevent the thing, Oh Foolish man! Is this thy Chief reliefe? Thy folly shews beliefe and Unbeliefe In thee at once; granted to Satan so. Which in the selfesame action thus doth flow. Didst not believe? Then Wherefore didst thou seek Unto this Ape? Didst thou believe truth keeps Unto his Word? Why didst thou undertake To render him a lyer and to make Away the man that shall succeed thyselfe? Yet didst thou not believe this hellish elfe, Thou wouldst account it needless thus to doe, But didst believe, yet b'lieve it t'overthrow. This shews thou dost believe God's false and true Beliefe and Unbeliefe to act thee too. These things do give thy hands a deeper stain Of crimson dy by harmless blood thus slain. But to go on when Crabbed Death had took To do this Tyrant. Things did better looke. Brave Valentinians sons come in his place 382Gratian and Valentinian through grace, Choice Gratian did for his Colleague choose Brave Theodosius. Now Grace ensues. ?eat Valentinian is drawn aside By's Arian grandam Justina to slide And hughly heaves now Ambrose to exile Who at Millain disturbance had awhile, But God was pleasd that much he should not do By his attempts his truth to overthrow. Persian Persecution. But let it be no fault if now my pen Out of the Roman Empire run to ken Beyond Euphrates how the State stands there And Oh! it tells you tragedies there were Sapores king crown'd in his mothers Womb As stories goe, and Tyrant forth doth come Stird by magicians up and by the Jews, Against the Christians, whom they do accuse Of sending to the Roman how things goe In Persia, who war upon them do. Hence he doth squeeze them first with Taxes great, Then overthrows their Oratoriall seats. Commands their Pastors and their Ministers To Execution: Jew and Soothsayers Cast Symeon in Prison, who as hee Was going there, did Usthazares see, (Who formerly Was Tutor to the King And now old man had much respect from him) He sharply did rebuke because he had Apostatizd from Christ. Hence he grows sad, Sadly laments his fall, begs pardon and Resumes his Faith, this to the King they hand Who him by flattery and frowns assails To take from Christ, but nothing now prevails For he replies, I've gainst my judgment done In worshipping as you the rising Sun. I'le be no more so mad and sottish vain, The Wrathfull King hence Charg'd and he was slain Then sixweekes thus before their easter day They in the prison do an hundred slay Of Pastors, Elders, other officers, All on a day, who had their Comforter That Worthy Symeon who Comfort brought Touching the glorious Death of Saints and taught The Resurrection from the Scriptures sure And then with Abedechalaas pure, And Ananias came to Martyredome And thus his race for Christ was bravely run. Pusaces then an Artist of the King Exhorting Ananias firm to cling Is judgd a Christian tooke, and stobt about The Neck, and also they his tongue hall out. And now goes out the bloody Edict which Death upon all that Christians were inflicts, And then among the left Azades who Was Chamberlain and was beloved too By th'King himselfe, is slain: which grievd the King, Hence Onely Teachers strikes he with his sting. And though this fire did all ore Persia stream It raged most i'th'tract of Diabene Where all were Christians, and in all it slew Full sixteen thousand, not of Comon shew. But after this, the fire brake out again When Foigerdes mannaged his reign For Aadas Bishop by a Zeale divine Who with greate Virtue much adornd did shine Subverted Vesta's Temple Pareum The which Magicians to the King did sum, Which when he heard, he did this Charge out bring To kill the man and down their Temples fling Which is attended; hence there up arose A persecution sore which onward goes For thirty yeare at once Continually Wherein the Persian Christians havockt ly. For Isdegerdes dead Gorones reigns His kingdom and his Cruelties mentains, Against the godly and he also dies And hands them both unto his son likewise. The Cruelties they mannaged were sore, To hear the same may make one shake all ore. They fley'd the skin off of the hands of some Off of the backs of others as they come, Off of the Heads of others, and begin Upon the brow and to the neck unskin, Then leave them in this wise. Some naked quite They Cover ore with reeds split down aright Fitting the Cutting reeds upon the flesh And bind with Cords from head to foot this dress. This done they drew with Violence away From ery part, that their sharp Edges may Thus drawn upon the flesh, cut, gash and Wound Thereby to make their tortures more abound. They many close in filthy Valts up shut And many Dormice caught and to them put, And having tide the martyres hands and feet That so they might not fright them when they Creep Upon them and the bats by hunger greate Being compelld do peck them up as meat: And so by little bits greate torments rise While being peckt and eate to Death each dies. And thus these Saints did for Christ holy Cause Sustain and overcome all hellish jawes, And if the same Consider'd be we'st finde Gods Patience in the Same most clearely shin'd The glory of it now doth seem so thick As if he did alone delight in it, Or else as if its brightness was so bright As did Gods other Properties benight. The Shine of Divine Justice Poore mop-ey'd man at all these horrid sights Not having sight enough to touch a Ray Of Righteousness, is ready t'aske for light, Is Justice Dead? Exild? or lost her way? T'uncloud her Beams and cleare the Aire that hides Se how she in her flaming Chariot rides. When Dioclesians reign was mild, Christs lambs Fell into Carnall Gospelling, did jarr And fight with Head, Horns, Teeth and Tongues (strange Hams) Dishonour God the Gospell, shame and slurr. They want a Rod and Clarifying times. Hence Justice Usd, these firy Whips and shines. These Rods worn to the stumps into the fire Are Cast, for justice hath as much to doe With Wicked Tyrants, as with saints in mire Of Sin. Hence such do set their joy in Woe. Hence Dioclesian faild in his design And Maximinian both, the Throne resign. Nicophorus saith Dioclesian Dide mad at thee, Milain, and thus he shows It was by plagues divine, do what he can, His body swells up, breaks, then meagre grows. God sets a fine upon his filthy tongue, Which had belcht out black blasphemies in throng. A Troop of Worms between his filthy jaws He musters up which from this mouth out crawle Whose fetid Stinck did fill his house, he draws The same in on his Putrid lungs withall Then out his Wicked Soule he breaths while he Was barking like a dog as like could bee. And as for Maximinian whose time At Nicomedia was private spent, Sore judgments ceizd sent from the hand divine And him unto his own Hobgoblins sent A fistulated ulcer up arose In's secret parts that did Physicians pose. The rage then of his sickness up did graze His intrails, and inutterable store Of Worms came bubbling up, all to amaze A Deadly stinck steamd from his rotten sore His Paunch all turnd to fat suppur'd, he's like A most intolerable, Horrid Sight. Hence some Physicians, who his filthy smell Could not indure, were slaine, and others some Because they Could not cure him, murder'd fell. Yet one comanded to be slain spake home Thou err'st, Oh Sir, Can Doctors cure Gods Wound? Minde how thy rage against Gods Saints was found. How thou an impious and profane man wast 'Gainst his Divine Religion risen thus, And thou shalt understand whence Cures are askt And to be sought by thee, and not from us. For I can die with others, yet assur'd That thou shalt not be by Physicians cur'd. Nay Dioclesians rage Confronted was In Syria with a Dread Earthquake which At Tyre and Sidon many Roofs did Clash And many thousand men on ruin pitch The like as Vincent saith fell out at Rome Which Perropag with forty men did doom. And at Spoleto th'Palace fell and slew Seven fiftie Pagans serving idols there When Gregory bishop fell an Angell flew Flaccas the bloody President that were Who for his Wages took a Pill full blew That made him all his intrails up spew. Dioscorus that slew for Christs deare name His daughter Barbary, dide by skie fire. A Demon did Vile Aprofrasius tame Did throw him head long down from's horse (good sire) At Mendula with Death did Christians Check And for his Wages Satan breaks his neck. The Captain who some women dragd full lewd Before the Court, they at Damascus held Where he by threats vile sclanders from them screwd 'Gainst Christian's if they vile prancks usd, and Geld. Hence hatred sprang, and Persecutions blaze His hand's his butcher, he the Calfe it flayes. And Maximine who gravd in sheets of braze His Vile decrees against Christs lambs hereon And Vaunts of Peace, health, Plenty, brought to pass By Idols, and them fixt on Pillars strong In Cities through his Empire with an eye False Gods to fame unto Eternity. But see this Fame defam'd immediatly For while this Edict now to pillars went God stopt the spouts of heaven, a season dry In winter led a grievous Famine sent, Some sell their Farms and others do not linger To sell their Choicest things for belly timber. Some noble Matron did, i'th'countrey goes A begging, some eate pills of grass full small Some fed on noxious herbs. Hence sickness grows Some look like lifely pictures, reel, dead fall, Some groveling in the street with hands out laid Scarce able to breath out yet hungry said. Many lay dead in streets and Corners sad Yea dogs devour'd them, hence the Living then Killd up these dogs lest that these dogs grow mad And man keen, and should hence devour men. One measure now of Wheate was, as its told, For five and twenty hundred Atticks sold. The Greate ones were to big for th'Famine's jaws. They're therefore bits left for the Pestilence Which fangs them with her firy burning Claws And to their bulks do Carbuncles dispense Whose burning pains so greate about their eyes Did many thousands blinde, of ery sise. And wars up rose and sorely vext his reign Th'Armenians that were his friends before These Christians he to idolls would Constrain Hence for the truth their wars did vex him sore. His brags of Peace, Health, Plenty now are blast And he confest God did these plagues downcast. But yet he shall not thus come off God still Comes to his Carrion, tortures it surprize Grows like a Picture, his souls sepulchre till His Eyes leape out and sight doth leave his eyes For his mad rage against Christs Cause he said These things befell him. Death then him out laid. His Pictures now and monuments he raisd Up for his and his Childrens glory bright Are tumbled down, broke, blurd and all dispraisd, His Children and his Kindred stroyed quite. His bloody Presidents with Phy upon 'em, Are all Cashiered too, good riddance of 'em. Maxentius too was moustrap't in the trap He set for Constantine; he triall made And found the bridge would tilt up, 't was his hap To fall by Tybur. Tyburn I'de have said He dide in Tyburs lap dropt from the ridge Of his devised Milvian boaty bridge. Licinius finds that God is just whose hand He could not shun by all his Witcheries But when he did Christ glorious Cause withstand And rowld in persecuting tyrannies Greate Constantine twice beates him, thus he sped, And after makes him shorter by the head. Millis who martyr'd by Sapores was Once to a Persian City tender made Of Christ with Exhortations greate, alass, Could none perswade, but was by them assaid Was by them scourged through the City, hence He dropt a Curse upon them going thence. Soon after which when that their governour The King offended had of Persia He sent his army out who as in war The City all in ruine then did lay. If thou abuse and thus refuse Gods son Divine revenge will thee to ruin run. When Teridates an Armenian prince In persecution fell and up had shut Great Gregory for fourteen yeares t'evince His rage and in a dirty dungeon put, Was turnd with house and Nobles by Gods power Int'Swine, saith Nicophor, themselves devour. That Cursed Arius the Heretick That set the Eastern Churches all on fire And put on Constantine a fob, a trick Swearing the Nicene Faith, but plaid the liar, Swore he believ'd as he had writ but ment A scrowlin's bosom, not that 'fore he'd sent. Hence Constantine not spying his strange jeare Charg'd he should have Church Fellowship again, But Alexander griev'd, his prayres and tears Prevented all, and laid the matter plain. Let me not see an end of this Dispute If Arius holds the truth, was part of's suite. But if the truth is on my part, I pray That Arius the broacher of this flame The punishment of all his impious fray May from thy holy hand indeed sustain. This prayre God hear'd, and Arius desert Is tumbled on his head unto his smart. For passing from the Palace as he came Nigh Constantines brave market where there stood A Marble Pillar Red he did sustain A terrour that he quickly understood He feels a Flux, asks for a Cuss-Johns-grace, And meets with one behinde the market place. He on it fainting sits and Voids his guts, His blood doth flush down then abundantly, His small roaps then come trailing out, out puts Much blood with's spleen and Liver; Death thereby This Cuss-Johns at Constantinople was Which folk in scorn did point at as they'd pass. Constantius son to Constantine the greate A Persecuting Arian Prince, (Oh! Deare) Doth Fall on Christ and Christ on him to beate All things a snick snarls ran it doth appeare. When Athenasius and the Nicene Faith His Synod had Condemnd, he sad things hath. 344God soon did make the Earth a trembling fall That did him beare, over the Eastern parts And chiefly then at Antioch withall Which for a twelve month altogether starts At Berytum in Phenice 't quaking fell And much thereof did ruin, histories tell. 347And Newcesaria in Pontus was Destroyed by an Earth-Quake, and all there Except the Church the Bishop such as pass 348Did unto it. Oh! that men God would feare. Darrachium in Dalmatia perisht soe Rome and Campania towns three dayes dance too When that the Arians an harlot bought To Charge Eustathius the bishop choice Of Antioch of being with her naught She rotted of a filthy sickness th'price Of her Vile Wickedness, rotts quite away. God will not let such pass without their pay. 350The Persian War did sorely stress, destroy And grieve them sore, taking their glory down At Daphne, Antiochs brave sububs, high An horrid monsters born so nigh the town A Babe with two Chins, mouths, two sets of teeth Two short prick Ears, four Eyes. Man such scarce seeth. 357At Antioch there plainly did appeare The sign now of a Cross not Comet like In heaven having a larg, thick yet Cleare And shining body of abundant light Stretcht fifteen furlons long out in the skie And answerable too in breadth, men spy. 363An Earth Quake now did shatter many towns Nice, Perinthus, Constantinople, sore And others too, Arsatius of renown Foresaw urgd to repent, was scorn'd therefore, God ruind Nice then by this Earthquake, nay Fire that fell down did it in ashes lay. 364The following yeare Constantius when he dide At Mopsus Wells of a strang Apoplex As out he went 'gainst Julian who tride Now for the Empire and to play the rex An Earth quake stroy'd Constantinople sore And injur'd many Eastern Cities more. 365Now Julian th'Aposte wares the Crown And in his scepter Vileness doth prevaile, Dread Earthquakes rise, throw many buildings down. All things within or out doores safty faile. Sore Droughts, hence scarcity of fruits up springs And persons hungry eat unwholsom things. A Persian War constrains him, out he goes Swares to destroy Christs lambs at his return But there his army pincht with hunger grows And now comes on a pace his time to mourn He now bewildred in the Desert were By th'treachery of th'Persian Pilot there. And in this case he's broacht up on a Speare Or as some say a Dart from heaven strong He with his fist tost th'blood i'th'aire, said there Thou Galilean hast me overcome In tending Christ in scorn so calld, He di'de And did without a grave unbur'd 'bide. His unckle Julian with Chamber Lee Profan'd at Antioch i'th'temple there Th'Communion Table, and Euzoy, when he Reproov'd him, he him boxt about the eare Then soon his guts did rot and's Excrements He upward through his mouth, not downwards vents. His rotten flesh is turnd to worms that ly At bottom knawing all his quick flesh up Of which sad stroke he dieth wretchedly Which others of his Palace did of Cut His Treasurer who scorn'd Christs Vessells dies By blood draind through his mouth froms Corps that flies. 369In Valentinians reign an Earthquake shakes The Universe and many Cities stroyes The sea doth seeke new quarters, and so makes Some dry land sea, some seay Coasts drains drie Hence by the roofes of houses when seas fell Cockboats invented were as some do tell. 371Hailstones so great as would a mans hand match Fell at Constantinople in greate store At Atrobate it rained woole, they Catch With rain indeed that from the Clouds flows o're 372Nice by an Earthquake's wholy now destroyd And Germa Hellespontine much annoy'd. Soon after Valens burnd eighty Choice Saints Up in a ship at Sea, a Famine greate So hunger bit the Phrygians, them it faints They leave their homes and take up other seates The Goths invade him, he i'th'war is smitt And in a Cottage burnt by them with it. The Goths when beat out of their own doore by The Huns, now Valens chuckled up in Thrace His guard he made, but th'Cockrell soon growes high And necks the Roost Cock when his spurs take place. Mevia too Queen of the Saracens Had almost took all's Eastern Quarters then. And as a sad presage of monstrous times Before the Pious Theodosias dies A Double Child at Emmaus out shines Single from th'navle down, up otherwise, Two backs, two breasts, two Heads, two Mouths, two faces Four Arms, four Eyes, four Cheeks, four Ears t'imbraces. One of these tops doth eate the other not Sometimes both sleep at once, though oft but one Sometimes they strike each other knock for knock But weep and Cry do both together it's known And this alive did nigh two years abide, Then one before the other, four dayes di'de. Presages 'fore this Pious Emp'rour dies, Were dreadfull. Earthquakes, Rains, Dark fogs each way, A great Ecclips 'for Pentecost surprize Did all the World with feare of th'judgment day. A Troop of Locust now about which pray're Cast i'th'East and West which spoild the aire. He that beholds these things, and such as these Will easly see how Justice Wares her shine In glorious Scutchons. These are golden fees Put in thy hand to plead her case divine These arguments will quite Confound all those That rise gainst Justice up her wicked foes. The Shine of Justice and Mercy together in Certain other Miracles When curst Licinius did wars prepare Against his brother Constantine Armed troops of men, of Constantines, repare March through Licinius' Cities fine When Constantines elsewhere did shine. 336When Constantine against the Byzants went, Twice beate before, he ahead espies The sign o'th'Cross by Stars in heaven thus pent By this sign ore all Enemies Do thou obtain thy Victories. Hermannus saith when Constantine assignd The Churches all their Tithes a shout Or Voice i'th'aire was heard, this out then chim'd This day there's Venom all about Into the Churches poured out. Malleolus asserts an hand was seen I'th Lataran, write on the Wall He'l Venom on the Church out poure most keen To day, and so it was. This all There present saw and red i'th'Hall. It's said to be the day Great Constantine Did Antichrists foundation lay When by his gift he's Empire did assign To th'Pope, which the we do gainsay For Constantine gave't not away. After the Vintage time Constantius was At Antioch, yea late i'th' yeare With Julian, welcom'd with Grapes, sweet trash And rain dropt on his robes while there And others, little Crosses cleare When Julians brother Gallus Cesar'd was Then Julian seeking Quizzards to And seing a grim Demon raisd, alas He's almost out of's wits scard so Then to the sign o'th'Cross doth go. The Demon seing this away doth high The Wizzards Chide him for the same Doth tell him that the Demon thus did fly Not from the Cross but in destaine To what he did: and this was plain. An other time in pagan wise he peeps Into mans intrails to espy The End of Christs religion: and there meets The sign o'th'Cross surrounded ly Within a Crown. This griev'd his Eyes. His Wizzards said the Doctrine of the Cross Should Circle like no end obtain, But Crowned ever be, But to its loss The Master Wizzard did mentain That they in prisons should it strain. He in fond hopes to proove Christs word a ly Great sums of Money gave the Jews To build their Temple up; they leap for joy And now to Carry't on they muze In sulking o're the Christians use. They two brave temples and more many do Hack at Damascus down indeed At Gaza and at Ascalon also At Berytus they so proceed And for their building flock with speed. Timber, stones, Brick, Clay, Lime and other things The Emperour on them bestows They, Mattocks, spades, Yea, silver Baskets bring Fall on the work, th'dust out throws And Rubbish out a pace now goes. Yet God them Counter-buffs, an heape of lime Some thousands of full measures were All scatterd thence, Yet on they goe: its time They finde the old foundation there And on't a new one up they reare. But loe by night an Earthquake rose, up spews Their stones o'th'old foundation laid And all things with the buildings neer down threw Slew many quite, and some half dead made Broke Legs, and Arms off others that there stay'd. They not dismaid yet at Gods angells shown A fresh fall on the worke again But fire from heaven, or balls of fire out thrown Burnt many workmen up with flame Tooles, Axes, hammers, stuffe for the frame. This fire continude burning all the day Did their materialls all destroy, At night the sign of th'Cross the skys display And in their Cloaths in darksom dy Crosses inprinted there, did ly. These Crosses they to wash and wipe out tride, But could not: then some did profess God angry were, and unto Christ they hide, Others still blindness did possess, Went sour away, with shame oppresst. But to dispatch Curst Julian a War With Persia calls him there to go An Earthquake stops his hast, yet when this bar Remov'd he went, the Skies then throw A fireball him to overthrow. The day before his fall an heathen judge Watching before the royall Hall At Antioch saw Stars inheapt to budge This sentence legible to all To day in Persia Julian falls. At night a friend of his, that elsewhere steeres Upon a journy took to him Lodgd in a Christian Oritory, there Not finding Welcome in the Inn, And wake or sleep, he sees this thing. There of th'Apostles met and Prophets many Bewaild the Princes Shamefull geere Towards the Churches and Consult if any Might something do, perplext they were Then two stand up, bad all good cheer. Then hastily they as to overthrow This Julians Empire left the rest The man amaizd his journy slackt, and so Another night that place possest And Cogitations filld his breast. And sleeping there he saw the Court again Convene to which and suddenly Those two as from their journey entring came And told the rest immediatly That Julian now slain did ly. The self same day, Learnd Dydimus a man Of Alexandria's Church, did fast Griev'd for the wickedness of Julian Against Gods Church and nought would tast The following night thus it he past. But sitting in his seat fell in a trance And in a rapture saw appeare White horses in the Aire that course and prance And riders on them very cleare Like Haraulds Crying loudly there. Tell Didymus that Julian is slain This very day about this time He hearing this arose, did eat again. To Athanasius the Divine Declard the same that truth might shine. 393In Gratians sixt year a strange star did rise Nigh Lucifer, whose beams shown cleare And to it flockt a troop of stars likewise Which like a swarm of Bees appeare About their Leader Clinging there. Then Light as from their mutuallity And strong assault, from all did shine Mixt in one Flame vanisht immediatly And turnd into a dreadfull sign An horrid, hugh, sharp sword that time The other stars receding to that sight That one alone which first was spide In its whole shape shown like the Root aright, Like that one star in shine, beside Like a light Matchcord-flame, up't hide About this time Proude Nilus sweld so high As if it would all Egypt drown And it did swell mens fears Exceedingly, Lest Alexandria's brave town And Lybia it would throw down. When that the Bakehouse Hall at Rome so vile Hem'd in with Taphouses and stews (The Bakhouse being under ground) did spoile Many a man, by wicked Crews Who did their Visiters abuse For through a privy way they oft Convay'd Their guests into this Bakhouse den Where they were kept to grinde, and therefore stay'd From ever going out agen And never heard of more by men. Brave Theodosius the greate had one Of his stout men cought through this doore Whose sword cut out his pass. He this made known The Emperour destroyd therefore The Bakhouse stowd with theeves and whores Another filthy trick at Rome was this They tooke her that was taken in Playing the Whore and forc'd much worse amiss They beastly use in Stews, and ring A bell while there they do the thing. This wicked Custom this good Prince thus neckt Made laws against adultery And worthily did Crush to good effect Such beastly things as did ?nny Th'Imperiall Seate of Italy. And when he grappled with Eugenius The Traitour who seemd to prevaile His holy prayers to heaven up thus Almighty God thou knowst I 'saile This War in Christs name not to fail. That Wickedness may meet with vengeance just If not take vengeance on me then: If in good Cause and in thyselfe I trust Stretch out thy hand lest heathen men Where is their God do say and ken? And rising up, Captain Macurius Routed the routing throng again A storm arose, blew back the darts, shot thus By's foes into their face amain And those his Cast till th'foe fell slain. And thus we se Gods glorious sparkling shine By various Providences gleam. Though sometimes Clouds do seme to dim the time, Yet soon the Beams of justice beam With Wisdom, Patience, Grace a stream. The Shine of Divine Truth The Glorie is not over yet. Truth brings A Bunch of glorious Beaming raise Unto this blessed Shine and sings Blnd up this bunch in glories' sheafe, the blaze Will grace the shine the more and bless the Phrase. This Century doth guild us with the Shine Of that bright Truth that snug doth ly Under the sixt and ore the Line Of th'seventh seale of th'sealed Prophesy Which being op'd did let this shine thence fly. Here opes the sixt seale of the sealed book Held in the hand of him who fild The glorious Throne in heaven, and tooke Revenge on those that had those Choice souls spilld Under the Altar praying for't, as killd. When that their Brethren had such Witness gin: As they, the Pagan heavens fall Their idol Saints black sackclouth grim Hence farewell day. Their Priesthood Moon withall Idolatry as all gore blood down shall. Their stars from Heaven drop like unripe figs Those pinking small Devotaries Hence Night good night Away there trigs All Time, both day and night, and so the Skies Their Heavens as a Book Claspt up now lie. Their kings and Captains creep in augar holes. The Birds of Paradise now sing Angells do tune the song With souls In Glory now before the Throne Within The King of Glory as they View this Thing. The seventh seale now opes a blissful rest Shines on Gods Darling Saints a while The Court in Heaven is possesst In Holy Worship where their High Priests pile Of Incense fumes their Works in graces Soile. Which being o're the Altars fire was Cast Down to the Earth. The Court then rang Like Lightning, Thunder and at last An Earth Quake rose. New Measures also sprang Seven Angells to the same did beate the drum. Three Woes on tiptoes stand for to surprize A sinfull Gospelld World alass Four Angells with four Trumpits rise And trumpet in the first which on doth pass Upon Apostates and a Triptote was. The first Trump blew: then Hail on Earth down fell With Fire and Blood Congeled ?ess To God, yet bloody Wrath from Hell The Gospell Soile of Truth's strong Trees most fresh And Graces Green's a third part burnt and less The second Angell sounds. A Lofty Mount Of Truth on fire drops in the Sea Of Banging Discipline. Men count To win the field by Words and wordy fray This floating Sea's third part's a bloody plea. Wicked Debates and Preaching Heresy A third of things destroy therein. Officiall ships whose sails run high Are for a third thereof shipt rack herein Whose balast was the Dregs of Drossy Sin. Christs Doctrine, and the ?aning it abusd Thus in the Eastern parts, uprose The third bright Angell, as is shewd And sounds his Trumpet out, there quickly goes A mighty torch, a lamplike star down throws. Constantius like a glorious star did fall Into the Arian slough from's state Once Orthodox and burns withall This Wormwood star's dropt down by woefull fate Into the Drills of Truth, whose springs out brake. A third part of these Waters poison'd are That through these Rivelets do drill The Arian Poison doth not spare At Alexandri' and Antioch to kill, And at Constantinople at their Will. A third part of the Sanctuary streams Oreflowing of the Eastern parts A third part of the Empire Creams With bitter S?oms and by their Doctors Arts Men many dy, Most poisond by their darts. Things thus now runing, the fourth Angell blows And soon the Gospell sun, Moon, stars Eclipsed are a third part lose Of their bright shine from day and night it scarrs A third thereof. Darkness their shine debars. Christs glorious beams, the sun of Righteousness Are one third buride in a fog The waning Church a third part less Of Light now wares. Gross ignorance doth Clog Her stars, her Children, Her times thus jog. And thus they run into the Century Ensuing with a third less shine Of Light and Life to th'Entery Of the next fearfull woe which in its time Should follow to beglory Truth Divine. Thus having seen the gleamings fourth of Truth Laid in Prophetick Lines before's And seing thus the matter shew'th The following Centuries befogging shoares, I'le in the sea thereof now strike my Oares. Grace, Patience, Justice, Truth, their golden Twine Fixt in the sparkling shuttles of these dayes Do shoote as darting beames and glistering shine To weave the Web with spangling glorious Rayes Running from stem to stern, from Selvedge spread To th'Selvedge of this Cent'ry's glittring Web. Which Coming in its shine thus from the Loome I now attemp to draw the fift therein And to display the Glory as the tune Hums in my shuttle as 't didst flying sing We'st se Gods Properties shine out hereby Wove through the Web of this fift Century. The Shine of Divine Grace. Although the Aire is thicker and more dull By foggy Vapors wherewithall 't was full And made a Darker Medium, halfe null Grace glories out And though the twine is Coarser and more tan'd The Chart less white where Graces Scutchons stand Hence shine more dim, yet they this shine ware, and Shine all about. Pass over Asia, you'le finde how Grace Beguilds with glorious Droughts its ancient face With beames dropt from her stars fixt in place These blanch the Day Jerusalem lets fall such Rayes in store Out darted from her stars as Nepos wore And Pollychrone, with Juvenall and more Did there display Here shone that learn'd Hesychius here made An Elder of this Church and many 't is said Shone forth at Bethlehem at Gaza staid At Ascalon At Joppa, Lydda, and Antipatris At Pella, at Tiberia, Archelais At Jemnia, Segor, Capitolis And Anthedon In Phenice now Antiochus shone bright Eustathius forth springd rich beams of light And many other to refell the night That staind the time Such stars top shone out in Arabia As Constantine, Malchus of Avara Ganton and Caineus of Medina In all their prime In Syria glory did begrace her soile At Antioch after Porphyry's guile In Holy Alexanders Peacefull stile That quencht the fire. And did imbalm in spices Chrysostroms name And Theodote did as a star there flame And other such did spread the gospell fame, Things thus Conspire. At Hieropolis these stars arose Brave Alexander and Panolby Foes To Vice, and John and Stephen follows those With Gospell Light And at Apemea Agapit sprang With Pollychrone a gospell Pious man And other such successively there ran Truths Cause to plight. Theodoret like Samuel from the Womb By fervent Pray're and Vowd to God in sum At Cyrus rose like to the shining sun Whose Rayes out fly. In Celosyria Theodulus His sacred Learning like a flaming bush Did shew its light evangelizd to Crush Iniquity. Mesopotamia doth enjoy this grace Marathus prayes the King int'healthy Case Acacius at Amida did embrace A gracious flame. Who with the Churches Will the Churches Plates Redeemd the Persian famish Captivates O'th'Roman Souldiers, fed them and translates Them home again. And at Edessa Rabula did shine Where Ibas shone (a much Disturbd Divine) And Peter too the glory of his time A Non-such Preacher At Haran Daniel bishopt it, the brother Of Ibas, and his People made a pother Him to exclude that they might have another To be their Teacher. Now in Cilicia at Mopsuestia One Theodore did Christs bright truth display (Though envy him with heresy doth ray) Chrysostoms friend. At Tarsus too another Theodore At Anazarbi Cyrus and before Him, Maximus, arose and many more Light to Commens Pamphylia shone then with Eustathyiu's light At Perga Bermian rose to plead aright And at Aspenda shone Tribunian bright With Gospell flame Issuria brightly shone where truth did spring Now at Seleucia Basil therein And Athanasius too did Christ their king Aloud proclaime Pisidia now's adorn'd with Gospell Phrase At Antioch Candidian did blaze And Pergamus and Hemus wore thy praise Olympius Lycia did ware the Gospell shine for there At Telmessus Savinian preacht who were The Judge of Eutyches whose sentence Cleare Might make him mush. Caria too sat in this blissfull flame At Aphrodisias Critonians name Recorded is, and Daniel did mentain At Cadus Christ. Constantinoples Synod found him right And so did that at Calcedon whose might Did Eutyches Confound and squander quite His Error splic'te. Ionia in this shine is bath'd and blesst At Ephesus Heraclides it spers't And Memnon too that angry sir possest The Candlestick. Then Basil, Basla'an then, then Stephan, Paul Then Cassianus, yet greate quarrells all These found: were innd and outted. Hence light small But smoake grew thick. And Lydia wore the Gospell Ornament At Trellis there Erodions shine out went At Sardis Florence out a flowrish sent Yet next with spots At Philadelphia Theophany At Straton shone. Euthenius full high At Colophen Ealatius shiningly Cri'de down all blots. At Caryss Zealous Menecrates rose And did Calcedon with Zeale oppose Dioscorus i'th'Snyod to his nose Thus sighing out This one man hath the Whole world spoil'd indeed And wee sit here attending him, a weed These three months space. And thus his Zeale did bleed And run about. At Smyrna Cyrus shone who when he new Made Bizants Walls demolisht, and thence flew To th'Church for Refuge, the Emperour he knew His blood did seeke. Stood as a Light in that bright Candlestick Proterius followed him, then Etherick Valerian in Lycaonias Bishoprick Iconicum keeps. Meonia hath her Candle light that flames Magnesia on Meander much obtains Much glory now her Daphnus there explains Christs truth full cleare Now Phrygia ware her Garlands. Pergamus Lighthed's with Phillip and Eutropius Laodicea with Numechius Who blinckt for feare At Synnadens the sounder part do Choose Them Theodosius for their Pastor those Not sound Agapatus, And so proove foes And hence the first Stirs up Autority these to Expell The town and Contry, and while told this bell Agapatus perswaded his part well From what was worst. Thus Theodosius while he plide his blame Both parts are reconcild in truth, Proclaim This Agapat their Pastor on the same They do Reject Thus Theodosius, and off he's Cast Poor man his Zeale or lucre ran so fast Do what he Can he cant avert the blast Of Disrespect Albertus preacheth at Hierapolis And Paul at Derbe and Strategius is At Polydorum. Doryleum hath this bliss Which flourisht in Eusebius who openly displayde Nestorius' Errour and Eutyches trade Erronius by his friendly speech first made Alone to him At Troas brave Sylvanus, nipt with Cold At Philippople, and through want its told In Spartane Sandalls went doth tend Christ fold In this warm place Where by his prayer a loaden ship which he Which strength of men could not, did easly free (Thought by some Demon firmly fixt to bee) Here shone his grace Dalmatius glorious grows at Cyzicum On whom the People choice resolvd did run In stead of Proclus t'whom the place did come To him assignd By the Bishop of Constantinople nam'd Sisinius but yet it was detaind For this good man, who clearly here mentaind The Truth refin'd Bythynia's glory grows now in her Town 454Of Calcedon where of full bright Renown Six hundred thirty Bishops did Cast down Nestorianism Eulalius scattered the Gospell Rayes And after him there Elutherius stayes That Christ might be adored with their Praise Unto him given At Nicomedia Pansophius clears The Gospell Cause and after him appears Himerius, Eunomius then who steers A rougher Sea. At Nice that famous town the Gospell's taught By Anastasius, who would be thought Their Metropolitan, then Peter sought Christ to display Heracleas is grac'de with Theodore Amastris with Themistius and more And Paul at Apollonias did glore And after him Faustus who strove Christs garden much to weed Of all the Darnell and the springing seed Which Peter Knave of Antioch did bleed And sow therein Now Hellespont is glazed with this shine For at Abydos now that Choice Divine Pamphillus waild the Errour of the time Did grace begrace And at Amalia shone Palladius Seleuctis: at Po? Etius At Hellespontine Troy Timotheus In Pious Case Galatia still the Gospell shine keeps on Leontius at Anoyra and when gone Came Theodate and many a worthy one The fold to keep. At Juliople Meliphthongus, and At Claudiople Aloger did stand And Peter did at Gangra hold his hand To feed Christs sheep. Still Cappadocia doth Christs Colours ware Where at Cesaria Firmus up did beare And then Thessalius, whose Call was rare Did labour here At Nazianzum Theodosius And Daniel at Colona. Atarbus At Trapezum at Neocesar's thus Patricius were Armenia still doth spring with Gospell Flowers At Theodosiople out there poures Eunomias his sweet perfumed showres And Peters flow. At Melitene Acacius as a Rose Arose and Gospell light there from him flows And many other which did sin oppose Which fain would grow. Sarmatia too lives in this bleaming Sun Peter disperst Christ's raise here and here run Such beams from John and others who did shun To walke in sin. Hircania too doth thus enjoy these beams Whose Bishop John did give his gospell gleams Against Vile Eutyches, whose nausious streams Did mischiefe bring. Affrican Lights I having gleaned thus ore Asia Do now sayle down the Coasts to Affrica To pick a Posy in the Gardens gay That there did grow In Egypt do these glorious flowers out shine Cyrill at Alexandria his Shrine Of Wealthy Learning, as a Rich Divine Did now bestow Proterius gave there Light, and Timothy Calld Salophaciol full of Charity Then John of Tabennesus, by and by Ambrosius Whose Elders were now Isidore full meek Peter and Athanasius Christs Sheep With Charmosine did very wisely seeke And mannage thus. This Church was honourd with these Deacons too Ischirion and Theodorus who Performd their Offices as well also They did attend Pergamius then that did them follow here Who governd Egypt once, prevaild with were By Bizants Bishop then this Office t'steere And to it bend. Eusebius now at Pelusiam did preach Gennadius at Hermopolis did teach Antheon's ?ouses Peter Knave did reach At Arsinoe. Archebius rul'd at Panephesus Whose piety did shine. Synesius Now a Cyrenian Bishop Th'ophilus Ordain'd also. Aurelius' gold shines at Carthage here Campolus followd him in holy geere Then Quodvultdeus their bright pastor were In times that frowne Then Deo gratias Thomas. And that man Of God Eugenius Whose Holy Fan Wrought Healings, did the Arrian Mischiefe ban And bandy down. O Hippo now thy glory flaming shines In pious Rayes sent from the Life and Lines O'th'flowing Oracle: thy Agustines Who shone in thee In whom the Gospell Glory shown so bright Through all the World as dazleth its sight A Pillar and a Bulwork too of Light Few like him bee. Evodius a deeply learnd Divine Did in Christ Cause now at Uzalus shine Pampinias too the Utecenssian prime Did now forth blaze Victor at Utica and Vincent now Culucita enjoy'd and th'Gospell plow Aslepius the Bajensian held and how, Its to his praise Valerian at Abensa now denies To give the Scriptures to their Enemies At Abbirita Felix's labours rise And do him spend At Tamalluna, Habetdeum who Christs Champion in sharp scourges up did grow And Antonine at Constantina loe Did Truth befriend. The Bizacenian Province now did ware The glory of the ministry most rare Now of Donatian and Crestonius faire In holy wise Now at Milexitum Severus rose Philologus at Bizacene up grows Junilius Choice but where he sat none shows His fame did rise. At Justinople out Primasius shone And Casulanus from his youth up grown In piety. And Boniface was known A Bishop wise Numedia's Crown doth ware these Pearles full bright, Xanthippus, Valentine, Restitute tite Megally, Possidonius th'Upright That truth proclaim'd Alepius great Aug'stines mate a Rose Grew at Tagasta and Christs Truth disclose Delphinus in Numedia's Churches shows Christs Cause mentain'd Such Holy Jems pale Mauritania's Crown At Castella Chimes Cereall's renown Voconius the Maul there that knocks down All Heresies Victor at Cartenna now plays the man Donatus too the Salicinian Who with his Church how from novatians ran In godly wise This glorious Light did bless the Ilands where In Sicily Paschasinus shone Cleare And Hilary at Syracuse too there Did preach Christs Name Justinian too: at Crete to Cyrillus, Euseby and Gennadius, and thus At Delos, Sabine and Timotheus Doloche's gain At Chios Triphon and Parally shine At Cyprus now's Olympius the Divine Sparitius follows him with his sweet line Of Heavenly light. At Rhodos rose Hellanious with beams At Lesbos and at Tenedos John gleams Florentius too, with shining Gospell streams To banish night. Europe's Shine I having glean'd up these in Affrica And in the Iland of the Midland sea I'le thrust a shore in Thrace and make my way In Europe there. And landing there, Thrace welcometh my shrine With her bright Glory, in Scutchons Choice Divine Hung at Constantinople out to shine With Grace most cleare Chrysostoms Golden Tongue here flowres which Drops Myrrh on the Wounded Soule: but off it lops The branch of Sin in Low or High by Chops Of Keen Reproofe The gist of Healing did inrich him and He also had a Peace procuring hand Did Pulpets cleare of Drones and vile ones fand Chaff off a loofe. And thus his faithfulness in Christ Choice Cause The Envy of Vile Courtiers and such draws Upon him, and they get him in their Claws And him Excile Arsatius fourscore years old dottish him Succeeds and then doth Atticus step in And then facetes Sisinnus up they bring One free from guile. Maximian, Proclus, Flavianus then Who was eject and murderd by base men Natalius who deserves not much with them That worthy are Gennadius then whose piety out brake And after him Acacius did Create Much trouble, did the Holy Office take, And bore his share. Then by a juggle Phranitas in Came Euphemius after him of better fame Who brookt not Peter Knave, nor with the Same Communion held Yet banisht was. Here in this town arose That famous Socrates who to us shows In his bright history was a sweet Rose How he excelld Constantinoples Elders too do shine As well as such as held the Bishops line Philip Theophilus Abra'm in fine With Menas there These Deacons also famous in it sprang Serapion, Germanus, Cassian Demetrius and Etius a Choice man And Marcian Deare Eutropius bishop was at Byzes and At Cela, Cyrill: also up now stand Lucian, Romanus also rose and damn'd Vile Eutyches. Francian, Cyricas, and So?imase Dorothy and Diogenes have place With many more Choice Ministers in Thrace That Christ did please Now Macedonia's adornd also With this bright shine which from such stars doth flow Rufus, Geronce, Sophone and Flavian too Prosdotius Oresteus, Macedonius and more Choice Pastors of their Churches that out bore The means of saving Grace, Topiris wore Eusebius Rufus did shine at Thessalonica And Anastasius and now they say At Theba Dion did Christs grace display There also rose At Crinth Perigrine, also there shone At Opus, Argi, Naupactus its known And at Megara and such towns men grown That Grace disclose Glycerius in Dalmatia rose a Light High Germany Christs gracious Beams did smite Severus and Solennis taught them t'plight The Faith with Christ But in Bavaria and Austria The Prophet Severinus did make Day A man of God in truth, yea ery way Did truth up highst Lucillus did at Fabiana grace Distill and Laureatum was the place Constantius preached Christ and did imbrace Them there with truth Paulinus was now Tiburina's star And Maximus Juvavium lighted far And yet it fell to him to fall by th'War As Hist'ry shewth. In Italy I come and fain would pick Some Roses here to straw my porch with thick But feare they grew of bryery stem tha't prick This makes me fear. But finding yet they still some sweetness give I some shall glean up hence that here did live Although their Leaves were ribd with spots, the shive Went with their Teere At Rome these Bishop't it with all their might As Anastasius who made all up right Stand at the reading of the Gospell Light Then Innocent Then Zosimus that for Romes Headship rose The Nicen Counsill hence with forg'ry showes But is opposed to his very nose And so beshent Him Boniface succeeds and took his track Celestine after him: upon whose back Came Xystus. Leo then who had the knack To plead for Rome Then Hilery came in, Simplicius, and Felix the third, Gelasius then did stand For Rome's suprimacy, a tower on sand Yet thus did bloome Brave Sedulus the Scot did sparkling shine In Italy Devonut about this time Peter Illyricus, Nola's Pauline Did Light display At Benevent Emylius was a star And Dorus, but Hesychius did spar Salona with Gods word, and did debar The darksom way Ticenum did injoy the golden Rayes Which Crispin, Epiphanius, and such blaze Withall and now Hostinus wore the bayes Potentia brings. Nuceria is begrac'd with Felix Choice Florence is Fed with good Zenobius voice And Gregory makes Mutina now rejoyce With Gospell things Bononia is by Petronius fed And Felix too, Ravenna also had Choice Peter and one John who struck the Head Rome, of thy pride Millain did flourish under Ven'rius Laurence and Eusby But Avitus Picentia's glory was. Philastrius Was Brixia's guide Learnd Maxima did at Taurinum shine At Aquileia Julian the Divine Nicetas too. Septimius at Altine Christs flock did tend Vigilius did send forth his learned rayes Of Piety at Trent had th'martyre's bayes And many did here obtain Choice praise Unto their End. From Italy I pass to Pass ore France To pick some pinks up hence, that did advance The glory of Christs Garden in't whose glance Doth take my pens Marselles first such Flowers presents as these Greek Honorate, Musaeus fruitefull trees Gennadya, Salvian and Cassian brieze As gospell Gems Now Lions baths herselfe all in those shines Bucherius, Patience, Rusticus Divines Of fame: Euphronius too whose pious shrines Wore stamps of Grace Vienna Claudian Mamert's rich pains Isitius and Salonius men of fame Wond'rous Severus and Patroclus gaines And gains apace Arles flowrishes with these sweet Roses bright Heros and Hilary whose Zeale did smite Romes arrogancy and Ravennus tite And here about Shone Rusticus and Vincent Lirinence At Aquitan Prosper did grace dispense At Troys Choice Lupus and Hymerius fence The Gospell stoute At Burdiaux Delphinus mans, Christs Light Simplicius too at Vason shone out bright The noble Pontellus whose beams did fright The night away. And at Avern now brave Sidonias were One that despensd Christs truth whose life shone cleare To gender love in human hearts, t'endeare To them Christs daye At Tours bright Martin shone a man of grace Of Pray're of Piety, Prophetick Race A Wonder working hand in him had place Yet fabulizd By monkish pens darken do his shine And after here Perpetuus the Divine And many were held out to Christs blessed line Eternalizde At Rhemes Remigius that famous star Frances Apostle pitcht the Gospell Bar Into Clodovi's heart the King and far It did shine here At Antisiodor Amator rose Germanus there the Gospell did disclose The Tungers had Servatius (as't goes Three hundred year) At Laudun Genebaud, and Bassian And many Others in these quarters sprang Sulpitius now arose and lay'd the man Here in these parts At Tarracon in Spain Ascanius shone At Barcilon was Nundinarius known Orosius now did flowrish: Turbius grown Doth shoot Christs darts We'l wade the Narrow Seas to England ore And here in London shone in brightsome glore Fastidius, Voadine and many more Palladius Chrysostom's scholar who here fought Christs fight Patrick, also Irelands Apostle bright Who went and filld that ile with gospell Light Its stori'd thus Here Ninian and Bacciarius brave Servanus, Kentigern and Tervan strave With Godelbert, Christs glorious Truth to have Men to embrace That they the saving fruits thereof might finde Evangelizingly fixt in their minde And not to let a ?igning sin behinde Keep in them place. These were some Organs of those glorious Beames That Grace did scatter in her shining gleams Ore all the World more Choice than golden streames Our souls to save That in these Rayes we might attracted rise In Soule above the Pavement of the Skies Unto the Palace of Eternall joyes In blissfull Waves. The Shine of Divine Patience intermixt here and there with some gleams of Grace. Yet while this Grace doth shine there with it breaks Out black, blew, yellow, green with tawny streaks Of ranckling poyson, nests of Pride, the Eggs Of Wildfire, bubs of Heresies, on Legs Of strange mishapen shape, appearing spurr'd, With Envy, Malices Curdling into Curd And Whea the Gospell Dary up to fill The Serpents Cheesfat presst with hellish skill In Cheeses for his Table, all the While Thy Patience, Lord, in Gloriousfolds doth smile Whose glory thickens while barbarian foes Breake in and on their barbarousness disclose While these strange storms and Tempests fall, My King His Web of Patience layes a whitening. 1. The Exercise of Divine Patience. Patience now on the Stage as rich Plate run Is scoured bright, till she out shines the sun With Wisp and Sand of Pride and Passion, stumps Of surliness, unmortified Lumps Of Adams race, Chips of the old old block That grinde and rub, yea some of better stock Well stockt with grace in Churches rich of glory As well as Prelates proude (more sad the story) Make such a Fume and dust that cloude the sphere Through which the sun of Patience's shines most clear. Old Jeroms Pen peake out these painting lines Saying Paul and Peter canted with the times in Comm. on Gal. 2. Young Austin brisk prickt in the heart by this Affronts the pen that thus did trudge amiss, As making sacred inke to patronize To its own overthrow. Officious Lies. The good old man's blood boiles at this, his heele Arm'd gamster like with Crooked spurs of steele Doth gag the youngster till he fights no more But onely sighs My Salve would better cure. 2 The Lungs those blankets of the heart do finde Themselves blown bladder like up with the Winde Of Pride that russles in the heart untill It blow the wildfire up from nature's kill That blessed Light Constantinople had Famous Chrysostom, good mens joy, but bad Who unto holy Lives were cursed foes Found him a sharp reproover and offt throws His Rod of Discipline and frowns on Clarks That vicious are, yea and his Zealous sparks Drop on the Sins of all, the Nobles and The Courtiers, yea the Emp'ress feel his hand Fall on their sins, at which their stomachs rise And envie seeke to pluck out's tongue and Eyes. Theophilus of Alexandria Makes Satans bellows hellish blasts display To blow this Light out, others too are bent Untill he's banisht: Such a foist hell vents. 3. At Ephesus a grievous brawl arose Choosing a Pastor, part do part oppose And so reject what ever Choice is made Untill Heracles his choice the franzy laid. 4. Theophilus of Alexandria Chrysostoms deadly foe flies quite away From truth he taught when he this truth did fame That God is not of humane shape or frame Which did offend th'Egyptian Clownish munks Anthropomorphites calld they stir their stumps And on him come resolving he shall die Unless he do his doctrine taught denie This set him in the stocks. Life's a sweet thing Rather than let it goe, bells backward ring I'le bane this truth, and banish Origen I'l an Anthropomorphite be like them And teach their Doctrine vile, alas poor man How dost thou sneake for feare? Barn Cat in pan? But sin ne'er stops. His rage and pride swells o're 'Gainst Peter and against good Isidore Two Elders of his Church whom his vile pate Projecting tempts to Excommunicate Peter because a Manichean he Received to fellowship of Church did free Without his knowledge. But this Charge so stout Was proovd a lie his head had anvilld out. And Isidore because he did display The Greedy Worm of this plump Prelate gay Reprooving him for building temple Walls And garnishing the same with what the Calls Of a Rich Noble Womans Will had made A Legacy she'd for Poor folks out laid. But Isidore him frumpt and told him plain They were the better temples of the twain And it was better to repare them with't Than to adorn his Temples with this gift. His slanderous Tongue did strangly too belie Dioscorus, Ammony, and Euseby And Euthemy who did depart from him Who in his Quine did forg a silver spring By Usury and to the Moncks repare In Scethis that more solitary are. These Monks Anthropomorphics mostly were To whom this tongue gives notice grieves to reare Unto their Guess, that they did not imbrace Their Doctrine, God like man had hands, Eyes, face And other parts as Scripture shews, and hence Did a mischievous War 'mongst them Commence. His sparks set Epiphanius of fame Against Chrysostom in a firy flame That as they parted each from each their tongues Did thus syllabicate such gusts their Lungs Did Ventilate. Old Epiphanius Said he do hope thou shall not Bishop die Said John I hope thou'lt enter not thine ile. He di'de at sea in's way: John in Exile. 5. When John Chrysostom banisht were, his Flock Tooke it so heavily and wore the Lock He hung upon their hearts that they withhold Communion and else where do enfold. The East and Western Churches do Contend To see this SILVER MOUTH stopt in the end. At Alexandria the Place appears In choosing of a bishop, by the Eares Some are for Timothy, for Cyrill some Who by the Souldiers to the throne doth come. Too long it is to amble through or wade Those dirty sloughs proud Prelates quarrells made How Nestory at Ephesus deposd Cyrill and Memnon whom they thus first nosde Constantinople reecks in fumes and blood At Alexandria they raise much mud. How Peters Chair at Rome begins to Crack By two plump Popes that croud in't bum and back Welface and Weltongue, Boniface a lurch And Eulaly, indeed oh Romish Church. How that Proteria's Deacons Peter Mog And vile Tim AElurus fell in hells bog Would not partake with him but AElurus By Priests eject and hereticks most flush Was bishopizde and in the night like hob Went unto severall Monks as sent from God And Angell them to charge not to partake With Protery but Tim their bishop make How Tims Disciples Alexandria in Came and took Protery i'th'Temple bring And butcher up drag 'bout the Citys street Burn then his body and his Ashes sweep And scatter in the Winds. How Egypts Monks Do snarle at Peter. How Rome's bishop frumps Acacius Constantinoples head Because his hand from Peter was not led, And did not stick him to depose, thus lurcht Rome then Constantinople's Church unchurcht And thus Gods Patience drilld in glory runs With beams that do beblinde ten thousand suns. 2. Patience Exercised under Errours and Heresies While Errours vile and Heresies the Spaune Of Pride and Jars do all becloude the Lawn Of milke white Truth, Patiences glorie wares A long gray beard and head bright silver haires. This Century stufft up herewith appears Like to a bag of straw with empty eares. Those Heresies in the last age that sprung Do still abound, still Marcions errours run In Persia: In Phrygia, yea at Rome Montanus weaves i'th'Cataphrigians loom At Rome, Constantinople, Ancyra Nice, Alexandria, and else where they Abound that rake Novatus from the dead Novation Churches now lift up their head The cursed Manecheans still abide That all the Ancient Scriptures have deni'de And doubt the truth of the New Testament Wherein it doth cry out at their ill sent They taught that God corrupted is, doth Change Is Changeable, is indegent, doth range The Soule is part of God: that was blinde Before Light had a being, and they finde Out many gods: and twelve more groate than others Which threefold stand in four chief rancks (strange poather) Surrounding him about whom they do call The Greatest king of kings, the Chiefe of all Having a scepter in his hand, and Crownd With curious flowers, with ruddy face is found. That God the Father dwells in Light, the son Hath vertue dwelling in the sun in throng And Wisdom in the Moon: The Holy Ghost Doth hold the Airey region for his Coast That Christ is but Phantastick in his birth Conception, Passion, Death here on the earth And fourty such blasphemous things are told Of God, Christ, the Creation, and Sin, hold These vile men and what follow doth from hence By the necessity of Consequence. Such dirty stuff upon the Gospell stall Faustus the Affrican did vend Withall The tribe of Manicheans in their plush As Adamantus, Fortunatus flush Sabellius still pours from his dust, his ly Denies three persons in the Deity Hieracis still doth walke though dead who cries Not this flesh but another up shall rise. The Arian filth o're flows whose Errours ferret Away the Godhead of the Son, and Spirit, And all those Orient Pearls of truth they stroy As will the swinesty of this Filth defy These cursed brats now teem'd out (as were bred) From Maximinus, and Felicians head. The Macedonian Filth and filthy stuff Apollinarius foists finde a pigs trough Who fed his pigs with Christs fless mere and said Christ had no Humane Soule: but mere flesh made. Anthropomorphites greatly do abound The old Priscillian slough (snake like) is found 414Pelagius an Englishman up dresst His diry Cookery in East and West That man was born with nature pure from sin Not Adams falt or stain was found in him, And that his Will was free and also could With offerd grace get glory, if he would. His poyson to the world and souls out trips When in Jerusalem out of his lips He spit it out in Syria, in Thrace, In Affrick, Sicill and in Rome apace In France and England too his native soile Which to the hurt of Grace he most did spoile 440And many joynd with him, but Julian most Bishop of Capua did like this tost Nestorius and Anastase a paire Bishop and Preist enthroned in the Chaire 430Of greate Constantinople, tap their Cask Of Errours now walking without a mask Thus Ana'stasius vents it as its spoke The Virgin Mary is no Theotoke Nestorius in all Contempt this said In two or three months space God is not made, Reflecting hence as if Christs Deity By Christs Conception smilde on such a Lie. 449Here in this place old Eutyches the monke I'th Valantinian well sets his new pump That Christs flesh was not true nor ours but made Anew in which through th'Virgins womb he'd wade And of this Liquour dranke did, and supple Acasius Bishop of Constantinople And Peter Gnoph the Antiochean 460Who with his mates five hundred such do damn The Councill brave of Calcedon which when It sat was of six hundred thirty men At Alexandria bibd of this Cup (Besides all Egypts ragged Monks that sup Three rammish Bishops first Dioscorus A Vile Blasphemer who at Ephesus In'ts second Counsill Proditorian calld For damning Eutychean tenets, bauld And flew like Mastive dog on Flavian Constantinoples bishop, spurnd the man And fisted him in such a furious guise That of it the good man the third day dies A Murderer a Whoremonger, Forsworn A wretched Liar, Life with sins all torn A botch of man kinde, sacrolegious Thiefe Who gave the gift, given to make reliefe For Poor and Pious persons unto those That strumpets were and Varlets, Gods great foes This surly Don did Excommunicate The Roman Bishop though of better shape. The second was Tim Elurus who drunke His belly full of water at this pump Ordain'd by faction and deposed sirs: And raisd at Alexandria bloody stirs Doth stooe his Curs upon Proterius Who run him through and drag his body, thus Slain, through the town and knaw his bowles like To Curs or Swine, who bishop was and right He banisht was, and by a joynt Consent Of worthy men, Grave, Learned, and intent Upon Christ truth about a thousand hee Exauthorizd and outed was wee see And judged that the Name of Christian should Be clipt all off from him, so vile they hold. Last Peter Mog Drunke with the foresaid drams Drops in this Chair (alas Poore Chair). Hee damns The Calcidonian Councill, stain'd with blood Of such as fell: When Elurus up stood Severus Antiochs Bishop wore this beard Chrysaphicus too, a gentleman o'th'Guard. Thirteen plump bishops such of Egypts were Three hundred Crabbed monks all of such geere Five hundred of the Headless sirs in sight Are such: and them we Monophysits write. But Vincent Victors low bell thus did tole That out of God himselfe God made mans soule. Old Donatus now all new vamped ore Is grown as budge as ever heretofore And thus while Heretick under the Mask Of sacred truth do tap the Hellish cask Of Filthy lies, that do becloud the sun The silken twine of Patience fine doth run. 3. Patience Exercised under Persecutions and Cruelties. Patience still is not halfe run out of breath But holdeth Justices hands while griefs or Death By Persecution doth great havock make Among Christs Flocks and for Christs pretious sake, For though the Halter tamed hath the Curs Or Pinsons Cured have their tooth ach urrs Or Curbs do cramp their jawes in some degree From worrying Christs lambs: yet still wee see Some Curst Curs snatch and worry too and loe The Horned Rams now of the Flocks do goe Together by the Ears with fury greate Untill their horns fly off, or necks do breake. 1. Theophilus, the Alexandrian B Throwing the learned Pall of his rich see Against Anthropomorphites who out swarm Like bees whose hive is hubd and make a Charm They'l sting him dead if's bells don't backward ring His metall to their bullet moulds runs in. And now his tinder's fired with their spark He calls a Synod and aloud doth bark At Origen whom to the fire they call Because he is th'Anthropomorphites maul. He brings old Epiphane (a better man) To sink old Origen in his deep damn, And by his juggles too doth him ingage Against Chrysostom till his spirits rage Chrysostom now (though a choice man indeed) Is Carrion to their Envie it to feed. Theophilus of Alexandria Strives might and main to break his back they say Because he did into Communion Admit Dioscorus, and th'Monks styld Long Who unto him from Egypt to complain Against Theophilus his Carriage came Wherefore to cloake his malice o're compleate This good old Cypriot doth basely cheate Into a fret against this shining Light Hence having Origen condemnd doth write To him to cease to reade his books at all: This not attended, blisters fret his gall. Hence Epiphane in heated hast doth trudge Unto Constantinople in a grudge, Calls an assembly, dubs a Deacon, and Juggles about till Origen is Damn'd Under this great and holie Worthies nose Whose Caution bad him have a care lest those He did thus grieve rose not about his ears And now in Chafes he hasts away with fears, On John the Courtiers now like mastives fall Whose grave reproofes they entertain with gall Eutropius the Chamberlain that makes The Altar screen his sin, he Checks, this Rakes Their Spleenishness, they bark at him like currs And now he feels their feathers all wave spurs. Gainas the Gottish Captain fumes, who could Not gain his Arians Church room, as he would: Oh! wretch forsworn. Eudoxia too, the queen, Doth whet her Edge against him very keen For feeling of his close reproofe she frets The Emperour upon his back she sets. He calls a Synod of Johns Enemies Who finde no Crimes but burden him with lies But let Chrysostom at the bar play th'man, Theophilus and's sociates do him damn, He's banisht too: Romes Innocent doth Chide The Emperour for's act: the folke beside Do tumult: John hence is calld home again And settled in his Charge to preach Christs name The sun shall lose his Light before John shall Thus have his mouth bemuzzld, cry they all But yet alass he is not long at ease Eudoxia's silver shrine did him displease Which raised were before saint Sophia's Church And stage playes acted at it; that his birch Did firk them for it. Now the Emperess Accounts herselfe revild: which to redress His saucy tongue that thus ore run its bancks Herodias doth fret a fresh, she stamps A fresh: a fresh she danceth, and for this She seeks a fresh Johns head brought in a dish. A Synod calls which damn him cause he took After deposd his Cure without their book. Although their ground they stood on groundless shines He was restault by sixty five Divines Hence he again is banisht: and so dies. His pious flock now weeping out their eyes Withdraw Communion and elsewhere meet To worship Christ and bow before his feet. Hence Innocent of Romes intreatings by Five Bishops and two Priests Johns Case might ly Before an Equall Synod to be scan'd Being neglected by Arcadius' hand Taking not heed of this Apostles plush He claps his burning Thunderbolt out thus Upon Arcadius' imperiall Dress And on Eudoxia too the Emperess On Atticus Constantinoples B And on Theophilus who held the see Of Alexandria, all whom (as spakes One Sozomen) he Excommunicates Strang thing indeed but let it Cockhorse ride As a soure Belch-up-hubd of Ant'christs pride. 2 Under Arcadius whose reign appears After Christs birth about four hundred years When Holy Chrysostom in exile went God on Constantinople-City sent, A dismall fire burning a Temple down And Curious Wealthy work of Court and town This darkning blot stuck on his jacket bright His pagan Captain reckens it the spite Of John Chrysostoms Friends, who in a rage Had thus avengde his Exile. Hence engage He doth against them, taketh Tygrius Their godly minister, and tares him thus With Scourges over all his body sore Doth binde and rack him dreadfully more o're Untill his joynts and limbs disjoynted are Nicephorus his story doth declare. Eutropius the Lecturer's out ta'ne Adjudged another raiser of this flame His body's rackt, beaten with Clubs and lashes, Bones broke with mauls, his limbs are cut with gashes His sides and Cheeks are furrowed with Claws His neather parts bunt till all parcht (What cause?) And thus cast into prison where he lies, (Though a young tender branch) untill he dies. Sisinnius Martyrius also With Alexander, godly Greeks do goe For France and study learning to obtain Under the famous Ambrose of Millain From whom they pass to Trent and ordain'd are By their Vigilius Christ to declare. And in the Vally of Anonia Now Hanault they a Church Collect, and stay Untill the people do for fruitfullness To Saturn sacrifice. Oh wickedness. Which when these Worthies bright would not attend These barb'rous Clowns their fury on them spend. They scourge them grievously, then breake the Head With a brass trumpet of Silonius, shed His pious blood then with an hatchet do Then with the Hatchet hack Martyrius too, On Stakes do fix him and him have away Unto their idoll, but Death spoils their play. But Alexander to inter their Dead Doth take them on his back, but off they're had And cast before their idoll in the fire And Alexander's scourgd, till he expire. Florentius and Hilary because They preached faithfully Christs blessed Laws Their tongues were pluckt out by the roots, its said, By Ado, yet they spake right words and aid The Church thereby, and helt on till they fell By th'sword slain at Sedunums Citidell. James Persa by king Isdegurde's command Because he gave to Christ his faithfull hand Had all his joynts and members cut in twain His Head and bodies trunck onely remain: And still because he will not Christ denie His head is made off by the Axe to fly. The Knight Sebastian, Courtier to the King Gonsericus the Vandall would not sing Unto his Arian pipe but bravely said As white bread for the royall Table's made By bolting fine the floure from bran, intire And use of Water baking't then with fire So I ground in the mill of th'Word Divine Within the Church and sifted in the fine Lawn Sive Repentance and wet well also In Baptism, bakd with the firy glow O'th'Holy Ghost, a Christian right am made, If then this Loafe again in finest trade Be ground and wet afresh and better bee I'le do what shall seem good to thine and thee. This answer though it silenc't him a while Yet soon he 'stroyes him by another wile. While Martian holds the helm whose Crown began Four hundred fifty years from Christ, up sprung The Duke of Cornwall's Daughter, Vesula When Maximus the Brittain bore great sway In Little Brittain she Espoused to Duke Conan, doth attempt the seas, to go Now with eleven hundred more to him And by a storm are cast away therein And such of them as swome ashore were slain By tyrants of a quite Contrary grain. When Leo reignd whose Empire first began Fourhundred Sixtyfour, Victorian The richest Adeumetine Citizen No wealthier in Affrick rose up then: King Hunerick the Vandall sought all means To bring him off to swim in's muddy streams To whom he saith, Determin what thou please In Christ my Lord and God I'm safe at ease I'st be the worst that ere the sun did see If I should be unkinde to him for thee. At which the tyrant was so mad he had Them torture him with torments mostly sad In middst of which he being by them triede He breathed out his Spirits upon Christ. Now Liberatus, Bonifacius With Servia, Rusticus and Septimus Rogatus, Maximus of Carthage all The Tyrant eggs, his flatteries do them call. With promises of Glory great great Pleasures With royall favour and all store of treasures To stamp their plate in th'Arian mint but when These golden baits fish not from Christ these men He loads them then with heavy Irons hard In darkesom Dungeon cast them, kept in ward Yet gaining nothing: he doth use this trick (An artist at all mischiefe) he'l them ship In a dry hulk incargo'de with drie sheavs: And out doth sayle and fires it in the seas. Yet all in vain: Fire won't their down bed burn Though many a time he lights it, it dies (strange turn) Then out he takes them as out of his Cage And dashes out their brains in hellish rage. When Crescus Captain of the Vandalls made France feel his heavy hand and did envade Langress, the bishop Desiderius From off the Wall entreated him not to crush But spare Christs Flock and thence he did repare Into the Temple where in earnest pray're To Christ they tooke him and tooke off his head Thus with his blood they dide their garments red. Antidius the Bishop doth at Tours Stick close to Christ while that these hellish powers Do wound his face and loade his back with wounds All ore and off his head tooke. Oh harsh sounds. Now while such dirty startups worne beare sway And Hellish spawns in velvet lead the way And Justice blacks away as strangled by Convulsion fits Twisting her joynts awry: And Grace in Sackcloath lies (oh mournfull story) These sandy wisps give Patiences mettall glory. The Shine of Divine Justice Bright Justice seem'd as she would take a nap And therefore laid her head in Patience's lap. But Patience slips her in her bed to sleep: And makes her glorious Curtains round it keep, And doth attend her too with all her train Of brightest glory, free from spot or stain. That none might her disturb. But yet the noise Of Wickedness is such she ope's her eyes Puts back the Curtains, up doth lift her head Sends flashes of her justice from her bed. Some of Whose glorious beams with sparkling light Do through these Chincks of Providence shine bright. 400 In the Reign of Honorious Arcadius begining I instance first i'th' frisks shee tooke to bring The Roman Monarchy to feel how sin Hath brought her to her Counts. She falls therefore Like to a Beast knockt down and all in Goare On whom the Barbarous nations, Vandalls, Gauls Goth, Huns and others hunger bitten fall Like Birds and beast of Prey on Carrion cling Some runing hence with this, some th'other Limb Untill the LET be wholy tooke away That prooves to Antichrists guilt horn delay Till those tell horns upon this head do bud That shall the necking Horn behinde them dub, And with their horns tipt with rich Gems in gold They stand his Lackie Boyes and's Stirrup hold. Good Theodolius newly gone to rest Ruffin Lieuetenant faithless in the East Impery'ish smells: packs with the Goths, its Coast T'invade. He'd fish in muddy waters most: To hang the Empire on his hooke, but the same Hangs in his gills, him drew up when he came Before his Host to meet Arcadius Entring Constantinople, Ruffinus Smelt ranck of treason, on him Justice set Before Arcadius makes another step. At th'Emp'rours feet th'Italian Souldiers Cut His head and right hand off: and up them put And hang over the Gate for all to see That Justice gives to Traitors such a fee. Now Gildo doth in Affrick too devise To flanker for himselfe the Empires thighs And for the same doth seventy thousand raise His brother Mascezels deare Children slayes Cause he unto the Emperour did show The treason. Now Honorious doth stow Five thousand Christian souldiers on him, stout Which Gildo's seventy thousand quickly rout. Gildo doth take the Sea but when to shoare He would, had's throat split open by an oare. But Mascezell full flesht here with, in pride Would have Imperiall Collops for him fride, But now he sought to live upon such fish 402His Souldiers servd his head up in a dish. The Scythick Huns in hunting of an Hart Did finde a Peephole never found by Art Out of their nest beyond Meotis fen Unto a better soile and better men Through which as through a Mase they Croud and strive Like swarms of Bees come poothering from their hive, O're into Europe, and about this time Did wast the Thracian Countrey with their line. And now Isaur'ian Theeves in troops infest As far as Haran: Phenice they molest. Gainas the Goth Captain of horse and foot Under Arcadius, making his sute To gain a temple for his Arian Crew Within th'Imperiall City, onward grew Into Rebellion, when denide, did Call His Countrey men the Goth out, and did fall Upon the Empire, tooke all Phrygia And yet at Chalced on his Oath did lay Not to Conspire against the Emp'rour life. Yet on he goes mentaining secret strife. He seeks Constantinople how to fire T'ore run the Roman Empire doth aspire (God hangs a dismall Commat o're the town That reacht from heaven to Earth nigh streaching down) Gainus by night his barb'rous Villains sends To burn th'Imperiall Palace which God tends A mighty troop of Angells in hugh shapes Of men in sparkling armour fright his apes They run away supposing that they were An host of Roman Souldiers placed there. But Gainas knowing such there could not bee The following night sent others out that hee Might do the feate not once nor twice, but they Do finde this mighty troop them frights away. He goes himselfe and findes the matter true And deeming's them but Roman souldiers flew Unto his Wiles doth feign himself possest By Satan: doth betake himselfe as best To Saint Johns Church to pray and with him's men Who closely sent in Vessells arms which when The Porters stop, they slay the Porters all And now the City on his men do fall Within the Walls. The Traitor leaves his prayers And flies: the Western Empire t'Catch prepares But still befoold he flies through Thrace and fell Into the Roman Souldiers hands who quell 404Him and his barbarous troop whose bloody Crimes Have blotcht the golden Leaves of those good times. Now Stillico a Vandall, king at Arm, Under Honorius whose sunshines warm This starved snake swops with the Goths to bring Th'imperiall Wreath about the brows to cling Of's son Eucherius whose sister was Honorius his Emperess alass. He trucks with th'Emperour no more to pay The stipend to the Goths the which the day Of need compeld him to, them to insense, Then draws the Sweves, Burgs, Alans, Vandalls thence By Golden promises for to infest The Bancks of Rhine and France too to molest. Hence Rhadagaise puts on his scythick steels With Goths two hundred thousand at his heels Resolve he'l cut the name of Christian off And all the Roman blood to's gods he'l Quaff. Thrace and Illyricum, Norice, each place 409Nigh Italy his sword and fires deface Doth enter Epennine and pitch his tent At Fesulee. Rome trembles at this sent, Calls to her aide Uldine and Sarus Dukes Of Huns and Goths, so out goes and enhooks Up Rhadagaise and's hosts within the Jaws Of the Felulian streights, untill their Maws Coy Cupboard, having nought at all to eate But Rocks, Pikes, Swords, or Arrows for their meate, The proude Blasphemer flies; yets quickly caught And made a mocking-stock Chain'd up then brought And honour'd with an halter, and his traile Are Captivde to enrich their foes by sale. Such as escapt fled to Alaricus I'th'east, who from Constantinople rush Did, and did Thessaly, Illyricum And to Ravenna all destroy and num. And nigh Potentia Honorius treats Him, and with him a sacred League Compleats. Constraind thereto because now France and Spain The Sueves and Vandalls and their mates had ta'en. But Stillico contrary to this League When Alerick his hosts to France did leade Fell on his reare and dreadfull slaughter made For which he's slain and's son, but alls not paid Alaricus returns, revenge is sweet, And bits untill his very teeth do meet. His fire and sword through Italy do prance And Rome shall take a turn too in this Dance. He hears a Voice say, Goe Destroy thou Rome He'd in the Siege (some say) two years consume 412Then takes it, makes it under's sword and Flames And Plundrings fall, save such i'th'temples came Now fill'd with spoiles he and his host out goes Within the Week and flood like overflows Sweeping down all before him far and neere Through Campany, Lucania, Brutia, steers For Sicily or Affrick, but the winde Did surly proove, set him an other minde And Wintering at Consence with his host His Corps did suddenly Exile his Ghost And was with mighty wealth Epitaphizde In Basence streams, so let such Wens be sisde. When brave Chrysostom fetch from Excile saw What Dancings and what stage playes then did draw In poyson to infest mens souls to wast Their time and souls Christ here in much disgrac'te And flam'd against these things and hence again Was banished, God sent a dismall flame That turnd the Temple and the Costly Work Of Court and Courtly structures unto dirt. Such mighty Haile stones God now tumbled down Scarce ere such in Constantinople town Beheld, and on the fourth day following Eudoxia her passing Peale doth ring. 410At Utica the Earth a lowing fell Seven dayes together now as stories tell. But as some say about ten years before A dreadfull Earth Quake was, the Skies all ore Seem'd all like flaming fire, a sad presage Of the sad times approaching on the stage So also When Chrysostom first was sent An Excile a dread Earthquake did endent The hearts with feare. Constantinople now Calls John again to hold the Gospell plow. 415Burgundians the tract of France neer Rhine Do by a mighty hand bow to their line. Athulph succeedeth Alarick the Goth, His Kingdom buds at Barcina (poor froth) Spain nots a nest of Vandals, Alans, Sueyes And Goths. Brittan the like game Cuts and playes, Doth Gratian Crown, who murder'd, Constantine Doth Clap his bum in th'throne of a low line. Then Constans son unto Bittannicus Of Monk is Cesarizde, and soon there rush Into it Scots and Picts and sore its stresst 421It shews to Rome but little is redresst. France through Fare is of all these rabble crew The which the north tracts on the Empire spew. 420She stirs her stumps, makes Varamund her king, They'l pluck the Beast a pieces lime from lime. Under Theodosius 2 in the East/Valentinianus 2 in the West begining 412/425 Croscus the Vandall king next Stilicon Who direfull persecution carrid on Wasting in France towns, Cities, Churches, Saints Justice he findes hath hands: attends Complaints He at the Siege of Arles is pris'ner ta'en With iron bracelets deckt, and shouts again, Circuited round about through ev'ry place He had destroy'd, unto his great disgrace Then brought to try what keen Edge tortures beare A wretched Death doth's Soule from's Carrion tare. When John the Penman Emperour would bee After Honorius, he arms you'l see 'Gainst whom is sent brave Ardabarius But's cast into John's Clutches: things run thus. Aspar his son is sent: who knowing that His Father's life's at stake, perplext here at The Emperour falls on his knees, doth bring By prayer from God an Angell, t'do the thing. Now Aspars Army by Ravenna's Lake An Angell in a Shephards weeds doth take And leads them through it dride up by Gods hand The like ne're known before, as on the land. He takes the town, his Father saves, doth slay The Tyrant: Now stages upraisd display Their joy. Whom Theodosius spoke thus to Lets leave this vain passtime, to Gods house go, And poure out hearty prayers and praise to him Whose hand hath done't. Hence fall they on that thing. But still all is not o're for Rugas Whom John gaind to aide him with his barb'rous throng Attempts the ruin of the Country still Hence Theodosius leaves it to Gods Will And fights with servant prayers that thunder slayes Rugas their Duke, and sickness sore decayes Most of his men: and the remaining part Fire did Consume which heaven made its dart Hence Proclus bishop did unto Gods praise Apply Ezekiels fire on Gog to blaze. The Vandall King Gunderick that or'e threw Brave Sevil and did make Christ Church there rue 427/9Did feel Gods hand was righteous the when thereby The Divell Ceisd him: that the wretch doth die. At Alexandria the hatefull Jews Their Sabbath dayes religiously don't use But spend in stageplays and in dancings till Their Quarrels with the Christian by a Bill Of Civill power fixt on the stage commands Them to be peacefull: Which while Hierax stands Reading it ore, who was a Christian much Endeard to Cyrill: Schoolmaster to such As came to learn, Whom the mad Jews do hall And bring before Orests, 'gainst him ball, As coming there to set all by the Eares He on the Stage torments him sorely there. Cyrill the Bishop grieved much at this Calls some Greate Jews reproves them, not a mess Withall doth ad his threats unless they do Desist such things: at which their fire doth glow Hence do Compact and in the night out Cry Saint Alexanders all on fire, but ly And lying under painthouses, close, still When Christians come to quench't, they did them kill. Cyrill provokt hereat permits 'm t'fall O'th'Jews in th'Synagogue to kill and mall. Things bad on all hands: hence the Emperour Exiles all jews from Alexandria far At Inmester twixt Syria's Antioch And Chalcedon this Villany out broke The Jews in stage playes in their Cups deride Christians and Christ himselfe with scorns they jybe Erect a Cross, do steale a Christian boy And hang thereon fast naild; then scorns let fly And scourge him till he giveth up the Ghost Hence rise sharp quarrelling in that hot Coast Untill th'imperiall sword did justice take And made the Synagogues these jews forsake. And now about Moses Cretenses rose Who for a twelve month up and down Crete goes Perswades the Jews that he was Moses, and Would through the Seas them lead to their own land: Which open would as the red sea before To give them pass, there follow him therefore Men, Women, Children, to an elbow steep, He them bewitcht, they leape down in the deep Hoping the Waves would ope to them away But oh they hug them close. Befooled they Do many perish. Some some Christians save Who were nigh fishing, up they'r took and gave Account to those behind that wayes they found Their Prophet Moses vanisht now or's drown They se the Divell hath befoold them sore And many of them Christians turn therefore In Cyrills time the Famous, modest, brave Deep read Philosophress Hypatia Grave Who in th'Platonick Schoole Philosophy Of all sorts read with such a bravery As drew from Countreyes round about each where Such as desired learning her to heare To Alexandria. Her modesty Would give her grace in any Prince's eye. She oft resorted and Conferd at times Orestes the Lieutenant, which inclines Some harebrains to impute the grudge betixt Him and their Cyrill by her means was fixt Hence Peter the Lecturer takes of his Crew And as her Coach came from Orestes, drew Her thence into Cesarium Church and there Do strip her naked tare her every where 422All o're her flesh with sharp shells till shee dies They cut her up in quarters as she lies Then carry her in Quarters to a place Calld Cinaron and burn to dust a pace Her quarters there. A dreadful fact what woe Cyrill hangs o're thy flock such things that do? When Boniface Affrick's Lieutenent fet 427(Vext that another in his place was set) Gensericus the Vandal out of Spain In Affrica this vandall wrackt his brain To bring all unto Arijsm there That on he went with ruin, rapine Speare And sword, yea sucking Babs to pieces dasht 'Gainst Rock or Ground, and some he also gasht Cut up from fundament unto their Crown And burnt their temples and their buildings down Torturd the ministers with cruelties To make them shew their treasures: did devise To gagg their mouths wide open and them tun Sea Waters, Vinigar, Oyle dregs or scum Nay stincking dung ramd in their jaws, whereby Many an holy saint he did destroy, Twist Cords about their brows or anckles till They rung again. He did Pampinias kill Bishop of Utica, by claping fresh Red firy plates of iron o're all his flesh. And put forth laws at Carthage to root out All Orthodox and gusted thus about He would not leave a man alive, and then Chargd in the sea forth with to drown these men But now attend, Justice begins to spur And Cramp the jaws of such a Cursed cur His mastife Proculus in Eugitane That wasted thus and burnt Gods Word in flame Doth bite his tongue to bits by's venom teeth And thus he falleth like a wretched theefe, One of these Vandals having Servants three That Christians were, who by the Kings decree Them dayly tortur'd till their gutts appeare Which by rich grace the next day cured were. The tyrant not regarding it, Gods red And burning anger him struck swiftly dead His Daughters and all Creatures too of Worth. His Wife alone and slaves left: who bestowth Her Christian servants on Sersaon who Was Cousin to Genserick, and now loe When he had got them in his paws the Divell Began to take possession and make Evill His Children, and his Servants, and his house, Gensericus too and his son though Crouce Did feele Gods hand making their stincking breath To leave their Carrion by a wretched death. A Dreadfull Earthquake all most all the World Was made to feel which many towers down whorld. The Cherronesian wall so mighty great It ruined: it made the Earth to breake To ope her mouth and swallow many towns Many and mighty trees to swallow down It drid up fountains, fountains made to spring Where dry land was, did many Vallies bring Into Great mountains, Sea's did vomit out Her fishes dead, did many ilands rout Ore tumbling them with waves. Ships on dry land Are now discernd, waters leaving there sand, And many Contries in Phrygia, In Hellespontus and Bithynia Were quite undone, this Woe abiding long Before it did depart, Plagues, Famines strong, Wild beast devouring, Earth-yawns and huge draughts Great Hail, Deep Snows, sharp frosts and stranger thoughts Great Sun Ecleipses, stars at noon day shine Are prodigies sent by the hand divine. We'le run to Persia, and see the Eye Of Justice how its sparkling beams out fly On the Magicians there who sought to fling Black Venom ranck in Isdegard their King Again Christ and to raise his spirits higher Upon the Persian God which is the fire. They dig an hole Under the herth and set A man there in, that when the King there met Before his God, should ball thus on him there (Yet so as if the fire the speaker were) Get out the King whom impious God deems And seing he so mightily esteems A Doctor of the Christian sect, he hee Did falsy count that he is prizd by mee. This griev'd the King: Maruthasias remov'de The Roman Legate, Christian, whom he lov'de Maruthas gives unto the king a hint That th' fire spake not, there was some hocas in't. Observe, quoth he, next voice, whence it doth rise And dig and see what Deity there lies. The which the King attends, doth catch the mole Doth for their magick all their houses tole. But still not still but let another foist Within a little while, which was thus tricde Where'ere the king doth go they for perfume Make an intolerable stinck up bloome And father't on the Christian Legats there As if they expert artist at such were. The King suspects their magick in the spell Doth searche and finds it so, and bumbs them well. But Barazanes reigning next is whet By these Magicians' sharp and on is set Upon Christ flock and doth them worry and By these magicians use a cruell hand And fright that they a pace do blating run To Theodosius; when before this done He had abusd, raisd up's imperiall ire To burn this Persian birch up in the fire, Sends Ardaburius forth with armed force Who through Medamnis into Persia Course There Azazena wast, and Naseus rout Who gathring strength against another bout Whose manhood in Mesopotamia They aimd to try and here they're drove away And pounded up in Isabis, meanwhile Bright Angells send to the Imperiall soile By passengers this word, Cheer up and pray Your souldiers shall soon rout and win the day And we are sent to rule this war for you. Now Barazanes hearing's armies flew Comes with the Sarrazens a mighty force But God affrighted them, that they do course And in Euphrates head long leape for feare Deeming the Roman Gallants on them were Set suddenly, an hundred thousand then Were drowned in these streams of armed men Thus Barazanes had his power quite spoild His souldiers which his pride Immortall stilde. Nestorius the Heretick did let fly His Blasphemy against Christ Deity 432/4And by a Counsill held at Ephesus Deposed was. Things came upon him thus When in Thebais Desert in banishment He was confin'd, the Worms that love bad sent Disht his blasphemous tongue for sweet viands And feasted on't till he had spent his sands. 442Before that flame brought in Attila's speare Greate Earthquakes at Constantinople were, The folk amaizd (these for three months abide) They leave the town and in the field reside, Perfume the Aire with pray'res for safety, Cry While Earth stood trembling. Lord let mercy high. At three a Clock in all their sight was caught Up in the aire a youth and this voice brought For three days space, biding of one to say To th'Bishop and they people thus to Pray Have mercy Oh thou Holy God on us Thou Holy strong One, Holy Immortall, thus, And nothing else. Proclus the Bishop said. Folke pray then thus and so the Earthquake stay'd. When one of those barbarian kings that came Some yeare before with Vororones flame And siegd Constantinople barkt out like Senacherib and Rabsheke in spite Did threat to burn Gods temple up with fire Eunomius then the Bishops prayr'e grew higher Not bearing of his rage, he's Engin plac'de Up on the Wall with a great Stone and Cast It at him in the Name that blasphem'd was The which directly on that king did pass His Cursed mouth and head gave such a bang And dasht out all his brains, made's mettle twang. The siege plucks up their stakes, such brains fall out, One single stone this mighty host did rout. Attila now the Hun, his father Dead Comes from his den, makes Christendom to dread, Distroying Thrace, Illyricum also But for six thousand pound weight gold did Goe Away from Theodose, But call'd again By Genserick the Vandall fled the main To Affrick drove o'pe by the painish Goths Whom to revenge Attila is not loath, Glides down the Rhine like to red flame of fire Destroying all on'ts bancks next Rome's empire, Having five hundred thousand at his heels 455Whose mettall in the Catalawnick fields Brave Etius tri'de whose instruments did slay An hundred eighty thousand in that day. Attila now distresst a bone fire made Of saddle bows would burn himselfe its said, But better Counsild, up he gets and runs Destroying as he goes, till Rome his drums Do summons, now Leo Romes Bishop sent Entreats his favour: Spare the City-tent. The Which he did and turns another way. One of his men enquired him t'display The reason why upon the Priests address He spared Rome? To whom he did profess. It was not for the Priests sake, whom he gave No honour to: But he there saw a brave And glorious Gray old man in Priestly 'ray And august Looks stand by the priest and say With drawn sword in his hand, he'd run me through If what the priest desird I would not doe And so returned home where first instauld Flagellum Dei: Malleus Orbis calld, And on his Wedden day in's Cups at night Chockt was with blood put in his nose to slight. But Etius brave for reasons not well known Not following of the foe, thus overthrown Had in requitall of the field he won His head struck off. The Empire's thus undone. On Valentinian one sighd out in scoff That with his left hand he his right cut off. 454 The reigns of Martianus in the East/ Maximus to Severus West Good Theodosius gone to rest his place On Martian fell, a martiall man by race, A Captains son, who going to enrole His name in Mars his Schoolebook, and his Scrole Finding a dead man in his way he fell Interring him, which proovd a grivous spell. For being cought therein, was chargd to bee A murderer, and must sustane the fee Of such an one at Philippopiles And all his slight cant wash his hands of this, Till God brings out the murtherer, and now Recorded is with men of Martiall brow And under Aspar out to war he goes Against Gensericus and Vandall foes, And being taken Captive now with more Gensericus desires to se therefore His Captives, out they're had unshackled, and Before the proud kings eyes do make their stand But Martian lay him down to take a sleep I'th'flaming sun whose beams an Eagle keeps Off from him with her stretcht out wings whereby She hoverd over him: shade did on him ly. The Vandall king amazd concludes he should Be Emperour and with him enter would Enter a league not to wage war against The Vandalls. Yet Rome thou thyselfe complain'st While Martians brow is Wreathed in the east Thy Valentinian's lustfull in the West 455And butcher'd is by Maximus, and he His servants slay and Tyber made to be His Grave, Genserick being also calld From Affrick to ease Eudoxy galld By Maximus who took her to his bed Who with his Vandalls came and plundered For fourteen days old Rome but did not burn The same, then with the plunder doth return Taking Eudoxy and her sprouts away Over the seas along to Affrica. But Martian in the East with pious shine And Righteous Carriage doth addorn the time. 455But as Presages of such black darke dayes The Earth doth Quake, Comets in heaven blaze The northern skies grow red like fire all mixt With firy streake in shapes of stars there fixt The moon obfuscated at Lions were Wild beast in troops ?semblys often peare, As Bares and Woolves and stags on men they prey Justice these dreadful things doth now display. 457In England did appeare a monstrous star Whose firy ray shone like a dragon far Out of whose mouth two beams came forth, of which One reacht out far than France, the other pitch Itselfe out did to'rds Ireland and so In seven lesser streams it out did flow. In the Reign of Leo which begun 464/ Severus and Anthemius, etc. In Leo's time Events of dismall hew Upon the heels of Wickedness ensue. At Antioch some in the City born Grew mad and fiercer than mad bruits forlorn 465A dreadfull Earthquake in September rose The whole New City nigh all over throws All stately, Costly built, no ground lay wast The Palace-Gates, four Porches, Turrets brac'te, The Galleries and Porches stately fine The Baths of Trajan, others too that joyn Nigh to the Ostracine in part well known And Palace lodgens utterly orethrown. Now at Constantinople out there brake A fire by some accurst Demomake Or Demon lighted in the Ox street North And burnt all down before it going forth Unto the Temple old of old Apollo South Julians Bay to Concords Church did swallow Up all like straw, Timber or Stone, to ashes Five furlons long and fourteen broad it passes. The East's infested with a Scythian War, In the Byzantick field a Cloudy Car That lookt like perfect fire did mannure poure Ashes an hand breadth thick such rain't did showre Upon the back of a dread Earthquake, fall Thrace Hellespont, Ionia, and all The fifty Cyclads ilands, Cnidos, Coe A dancing, and much building down doth goe. And at Constantinople also in Bythinia three or four dayes do bring Taps to the Clouds, their spouts like rivers run Mountains and Hills knockt down, do lie undone And all made plains. Villages overflown The Lake by Nicomedia called Boan With heaps of rubbish pild therein doth seem So many Ilands in it forth to teem. The Western part distracted all doth ly. Rome is a shambles made, or butchery And Emperours the Bullocks fetted fell, Anthemius, Olymbrius as Well. Leo now Ardaburius takes to task, And Aspar too his son, mere Vandalll Cask With Arian dregs grown musty troubling The Churches, and against the Counsills fling Of Nice and Chalcedon and threaten do The Empire on Genserick to bestow. Hence off he takes them. Ardaburius first, And Aspar sighing o're his Corps, out burst Into these words. The old man truly beares Destruction much becoming his gray haires; Who vanely gloried and would not take My warning; for I oft thus to him spake Let's eate up Leo first, before in health He dish us up a dinner for himselfe. But now my pen doth weep to lay before yee The Dismall things it finds: attend the story. God pinches them in Affrick with sore draught That Wells are emty, mighty Rivers brought To suffer thirst, a Dreadfull famine grows Now hunger makes them seek grass roots like those Poore bruits whose snouts are fitted for the same. The Vandalls guts under this fine forth came It tumbled down whole troops; the wayes it straws With Carkasses, a dinner lean for daws, None being found at all to bury them And many places were devest of men. But yet Hunericus doth set his speare Against Gods Saint as Vacant of Gods feare, He set his hawks at Carthag Temple doore With toothed staves that should all such as wore Vandallick garbs lay on amight and maine Upon their heads, wherewith a many ta'en Had hair and skin halld off their heads by th'teeth Upon their staves: some eyes out di'de with griefe Then to another trick he consilld is By's Arian Dons and it indeed was this, To purge his house of such Catholick mire As would not tune unto the Arian Lyre, And this he doeth, but this is gentle Sir, Now under shew of jealosie goes far, Calls pious virgins forth: and midwives must Openly search in presence of unjust Vile men, all naked, lest they be with child, Alas poore hearts! they are by him beguild, He hangs them up, great weights hangs at their feets Claps to their Backs, Sides, Breast and Bellies, sheets Of red hot iron, to make them Arian turn But firy arguments their faith can't burn. Then nigh five thousand persons of all rancks Are brought for banishment hookt in his Cranks, Mongst whom was Felix by the Palsy ta'en Whose feeling's lost and speech, for whom they fain Would have the King vouchsafe him leave to stay At Carthage till his breath was gone away. But all the gain was packt in this reply With swelling stomach, to a rope Ile ty And draw him there with oxen where they go If on a beast he cannot ride thereto. At Siccens and at Larens all now stay, And gi'ne to Maurs to take them all away, Who by some Noble knights with speeches kinde Entreated are to weathercock their minde, To whom they all, as one, replying said We Christian are and this Confession made, And God Confess to be Triune and hee We ever hold this One Gods Trinity Then in the jaole they're cast, yet not denide Their friends access, by whom they are supplide, For which their keepers Cudgelld are, and they Unto a Pound so streight are had away They're cast as Corns of Wheate all into heaps Without all room privy to nature's leaks The which no royall Edict plug up could, Necessity its law obey it would And its obedience shewd spite of their teeth In its Eruptions from them to their griefe Ly they or stand: untill the place did flow With what necessity constrain'd to go. One Cyprian bishop of Vinzibire With many tears them Comfort and raise higher Their state observd, they from their Jaquy Pound Are brought ore plasterd heads, face, Robes abound With humane fiants yet sung in these paints This Psalm, to wit, This glore have all his saints. Now in their grievous and long journey some Were tired out, and these they goad along: With spears untill thy can no longer goe Then them with Coards tide to their feet they tow Ore Rocky places till they're torn and dy Whose graves like mole hills all the way ore ly, And when the rest are come unto the place Design'd, they're kept with barly for a space Like beasts, but long this bread doth not abide. It is too good for some, hence is denide. And after this he set a trap, and baits With hony saps, To bring all out of straits He calls a Counsill that shall now Dispute The Point with arguments fetcht from Gods book At Carthage, but before they came, he sent Some others Orthodox in t'banishment. Others he Cudgelled. But when they came Together, he burnt Laetus in red flame Then he the Roman Laws imperiall Gainst Arrians made and men hereticall, Doth weld upon his anvill, sets thereon An Homoiousian edge on's Grindleston Untill it will all orthodox avoide This is the sword hung at the Arrians side Which flowrisht at Carthage Calends the Sixth Of March the seventh year his reign hath pitcht. But by this Edict all the Orthodox At Carthage met in Counsill he down knocks Ships beare of all, house, harbour, wealth, and friends Thrust out of City, and if any spend Respect upon them, forthwith shall the same Have's house with all therein burn'd into flame. Amaizd hereat these good Professors stand If in they go, all lost is out of hand, If they withdraw, they fear the foe will say They to avoide Dispute did run away. Hence in the Sun under the Walls they ly Implorying God with sighs profound they cry. But when the King passt by, they to him runn Grievously urge, sir, why are we undone? What have we done that we such things must beare? Are we calld here to argue? Why then are We of our Wealth, Homes, Families, nay more Churches and Human Consort spoild therefore Why do we perish here thus wretchedly By Famine greate and by great poverty? He on them then Casting a Crabbid looke Did bid this troop to tread them under foot. The which they did that many thus were slain And all ore affrica this fury came. Some banisht were, some beaten were with staves Some Hang'd, some burn'd, and so beguild the graves Some had their Right hands and their Tongues off Cut And at Calusitan the tyrant put A mighty multitude to martyredome At Tambriens also: none gives the Sum. At Tipasensis of great Mauritane Hearing this news, a man of Arrian strain Was coming on to be their pastor most Of all the Church saild to the Spanish coast; And such as stayd behind because they would Not heare the Arian, their Case was told Unto the King who sent a Knight who Cut Their Tongues and right hands off. But yet no stut Was in their mouths: but they distinctly spoke As Victor saith and other of good note. But now return we to the Tyrant vast Behold him in the Shackles justice Cast Him in before the Sun had rounded in An annuall Circle round his Carthage din. A Burning Ulcer on his Carrion rose In boyling torment long and slowly goes Till all Corrupt and rotten worms out Crawle And rotten lumps of flesh off from him fall, And Gregory of Tours doth further adde, A Divell ceisd him, and his own-hands had The Honour now his Carcass all to rend And in horrendous gripes his life to end. That not his Corps but scraps thereof do fall To have the honour of a buriall. In the Reign of Zeno in the East 478, reignd 17. Rome hath lost all in Augustulus 478Zeno comes on the stage, a beastly man, And in his Dayes all things against him ran. His Empire from him pass, as by him shamde By Basiliscus tyrant it was Gaind. The East and West ore run with barb'rous foes And Odoacer Romulus ore throwes For Romulus nigh thirteen hundred yeare Before this day Built Rome and Thrond was there Augustus who five hundred year and more Had raisd the Empires glory up before, Do both their names upon this Person plight: In whom the Empire bids their seats good night. All things run raggedly when Zeno had Once more with robes imperiall been clad. Theodorick destroys all Thrace doth come Beats 'fore Constantinoples dore his drum And By a speare after their fort up tide Was on his pawing hourse back lanc'd in's side That let his life ore run him. Martian then Romes Emperours Cockerill for the Diadem Imperiall, draws out his sword but falls And others too, Which things give open Calls. A fire breaks in the Braziers Market out And burnt to ashes buildings round about, And the Collectors Lane and houses neer, A Chappell and a Library there: An hundred twenty thousands Volumn brave Were burnt therein and had an ashie grave. Therein was also burnt a Dragons gut Full six score foot in length without all smut. The Iliads and Odyssean lines Of Homer in't were writ in golden shines. Tim Elurus that varlot now doth feele His wicked Course more sharper is then steel For feare lest Zeno should his deeds requite He doth't him: saves him the labour right Doth drinke a Cup of poyson in an health Prepared by his wisdom for himselfe. 404Not Zeno by an Epilepsy dead Th'Imperiall Crown guilds Anastasius' head Yet first is forc't under his hand and oath T'ingage not t'alter Church affairs though loath. His Throne is troubld for Longinus tries His mettall that with his Isaurian bayes He might a golden throne ascend, but brake His head was made a Crown unto a stake And Theodore's at Sycee ore against Constantinople. Traitor! thou obtainst! Let no man say Justice hath lost her Eyes While Patience's Nose her Spectacles imploies Her flashing beams her Eyes dart out in ire You see run through this Century like fire. The Displayes of Various Divine Properties in Miraculous Operations When John Chrysostoms holy Pulpit flung A silver drill of Rhetorick which run The Macedonian Heresy a drift It gave to many men a thorow lift Out from that mire, whereof one person came To see aright, whose wife disdaind his gain Whom when he could not win to thinke aright Of Christ he said he'de turn her from him quite. This frights her: now she truckles to his will But yet compacte doth with her maid by skill All naught to mock Gods holy feast hence when The Church Christ supper kept, her maid should then Slip other bread into her hand, the which SOZO 1.8.c.5She eate would, and the right way gags by tricks But kneeling down prayre wise this prank to plite The bread of treachery as she did bite Was turnd between her teeth into a stone Which with the print thereof was brought and shown All in Confusion, and amaizement to The minister and all the knav'ry show With sorrow begging pardon for the sin, And to her husbands faith her faith did bring. This stone Constantinople's Church thought meet Allong while for a monument to keep. EvagrFrom Antioch three hundred furlons nigh Stood on an hill Saint Simeons Pillar by Four Porches flourisht gay Whose windows were A playhouse for a star great, bright, and Cleare Evagrius saith, he went with many more And saw the same, pop in and out, moreore It vanish would and would appeare again In Chincks and Windows on the left hand plain. Its doubtless true and doubtless we may say The Divell in the star did boe peep play. Sigebern An? Dom.453When France's Vasute was by Huns up pent And Arian filth grew cudge, Grace freedom sent. The Minister three Drops of water spide Joyn'd Equall big and bright like Christall slide From th'Temple roofe th'Communion board upon One gem most beautifull, made, joynd in one Which Ouched in a Cross of Gold about With Gems infoild, two of its gems fell out When that Hunorious the Vandall flew Like a mad Tyger on Gods Churches true Coryla then his Arian bishop vile The Authour of that mischiefe up doth boile His envie at Vindemiall, Longine, Eugenius too, In whom the Gift Divine Of Healing shone, gave fifty lumps of gold Unto a man that counterfet he would Himselfe born blinde, and in this wise should say Most Blesst Coryla help I humbly pray Thy Glory and thy Vertue now imply Grego: Turon: Li. 2. c. 3. In opening of mine Eyes, immediately Coryla came and on his fingers laid Upon his Eye; Oh Wretched! and thus said, According to our Faith, we have aright In God let these thine Eyes receive their Light. And at these words such pain surprisd his eyes That lest they should fly out, the man applies His fingers hard upon them, and proclaims The Hocus unto all: to Coryl's shame, And then was healed by the prayres divine Eugenius made Vindemiall and Longine. A Painter at Constantinople in The time Gennadious plaide on the string The Gospell Harp was strung with, had his hand Theodor. Lector. L. 1. All wither'd up, with which he did command His Pensill lining Jupiter in scorn With colours laid in Christ our Saviours Form But terrifide hereat Confisst his sin Gennadius by Prayre restored him. Hunericus the Vandall board did fling Carthage's Bishop Quodvultdeus in A broken ship, and more a mighty troop With him, and in such shatterd vessells-sloops Victor Vandel: Persec: 1. 1. To lap them up in Waves. But God did bring Them Safe unto Neapolis therein. At Typaserp in greater Mauritane Some Christians that did Cyrola disdaine Striving to Arianize them were brought out Into the Market place before the rout And had their tongues Cut out and right hands off lib. 3. Who yet did talk distinctly, strange, strange scoff: One Resarate in Zeno's time still here Saith Victor at Constantinople were. Christians that into Affrick Deserts-wasts Of Venom animalls and scorpions blasts The very nest where such as long abide Vit: 1: 2. Are sucking in the venom aire destroyde Did yet receive no harm therein at all Return'd sound out of these Venoms Hall. In France at Tholous many yeares had not The Catalaunian blood shed over got Blood all day through it flow'd untill it were Sigeb sub An? Ch. 461. A River Vast. Is Egypts plague sent here? While good Gennadius at Christs Table stood And grace for all the world in prayre out su'de A Diabolick spectre did appeare And in mans voice spake to him as we hear Niceph: Whilst thou dost live I'le quiet be and still But then the Church I each way trouble will. In Zeno's time a woman at one time Did bring forth seven Children babies fine. But them she drownded in a fish pond there, More like a strumpet than a mother deare. The River called Minous in Spain Supplide the Fisher men with fishy gain Sigeb: Upon whose scales the Era of that yeare Four hundred ninty one found written were. My Pen to stir her blood did thus o'th'slide Upon times lake five hundred years long glide And edging on the Sixth she plies her gaine To run her slide in length quite ore the same Begins in Affrick skims through Asia's sounds Down Europe West the midland sea thus rounds. Affrick Poore Affrica how doth thy glory wane More bright thou wast than many other parts Gods Grace in Christ did shine so free and plaine But now alas! much mire and firy darts. Glory did shine in brightest grace betime But Patience now doth ware the clearest shine. The Glory of Divine Grace In Carthage Reparatus flours his Rayes Of Gospell truth: Lucinian after's dayes Then Dominus full pious, learnd doth raise His Zealous flames And after him Ferrandus deaconizde His Pious Learned, holy Life much prizde Whose holy Pen describd the pious Guise Of souldiers frames. At Utica Ferreolus did ring Albinus told the bell there after him, Marcellus follows him to tole all in To Christ our Lord. Maurice Chiefe Bishop then of Affrica Panthalion, and Adeodate they say First in Numedia then all Affrick stay And preach the Word At Commens Victor in Christs Church doth shine Who from the Worlds begining drew a line Of Worthy History to Justines time A Bishop choice. Amandus chosen by the Suretines To be their Bishop but as grace divine Had brought him to't. Pope Gregory's chast lines Pict in their voice. Fulgentius as a glorious shining star In the Raspensian Church shines out and far Displayes a broad the Gospells Golden bar In life and line Truths golden Pillar and the Arians Mall In trouble much: on's death bed thus did call Give me Repentance and me pardon all, O see his shine At Alexandria John John succeeds A man of sounder Faith and Fairer deeds The Chalcidonian Counsill ever heeds Though banisht for't. Then Thedoz follows of another Face, Then Zoilus who was of better grace Apothinaz and Eulogy him trace In worthy sort The midland seas doe many mention, but The most they mention do do beare such smut I ore pass, yet 'twas Speciosus' Cut Now Uxorate Catana drew for Bishop, but the Pope Great Gregory his Chaster mouth did ope Thus that he must his Wife leave, or revoke A Bishops State Hence he deposed from his Bishops Pall That he his marriage Covenant withall Most faithfully to keep and so did fall To be a Scribe Then in this Church Sicilian at Catane John was whom Gregory sought to gain Bishop for brave Syracuse in plain And there Reside And at Gregento in this Ile shone cleare In holy Life and Doctrine bright and deare One Gregory that much adorned were With Eloquence Eusanius then supplied the bishops place Savinian at Calliople grace Did there unfold that they might Christ imbrace In a right Sense. ASIA's Worthies. Now passing ore from Affrica I come To Asia and in it glean up some That in this Century did beate Christs drum Most worthily In Palestina at Jerusalem Salustius bishop was, Elias then A worthy man yet vext by wicked men And Villany John after him who first did nod a wry But by brave Abbas gain'd shewd Constancy Unto the truth, for which was made to ly In prison brought Peter did him succeed Macarius him Eustachius then, then John Christ bell did ring Neamus then came to't, and then the string Isicius caught. Bewailing now no more Choice men Divine Worth Pen and Paper honour Palestine I pass ore Hermon and do run my line Ore Syria And here at Antioch choice Flavian Disturbd by Xeneas did play the man Could not be forc'd Chalcedons Faith to damn Was sent away Leap ore Severus and Pauls head, I'le sing Euphrasius one of a better wing Slain by an Earthquake there that death did bring To many more Then Ephraim who in this sad Case supplide The City with all things for which she cride Then Domnus after him the Flock did guide Presiding ore, Brave Anastasius to the Pulpet came Who when Justinian Christ flesh would proclaim Not mortall, forcing Elders to the same His Faith stood strong Then they all said they would their Bishop ne're Desert but follow. Hence the Emp'rour were Designd to banish him but di'de first there Yet was ere long Then Gregory that Bishops seat obtaind Who when the souldiers left their Faith, them gain'd Unto the Emperour, that they mentain'd Th'Imperiall line Who to Cosroes by the Emperour lent So Charmd him with his tongue he did present A Cross of Gold with precious Gems set, spent On Sergius Shrine. He bicker'd much with Hereticks and won Towns yea whole tribes that to the truth now run But biting Hermes Fingers off's undone And di'de thereby. Euphemius follows him, then John whose pen The Monophysits greatly in their den Did pound and pummell that his works with men Of fame did fly. Peter now Bishop was, Damascus, thine At Arethusa did Severian shine And at Apamea in Syrias line Conon arose Who chang'd his mitre for a sword when need, Paul after him who wrote against the Deed Hereticall to th'Emperour to proceed And them oppose. At Tyre now Epiphanius shone forth bright An other of this name did Papia light With Gospell beams. At Epiphania night 'Fore Cosmus flew Whose Deacon nam'de Arelian gave unto Severus th'Heretick a bill to show Him that the Bishops him unbishopt so In womens shew. Phenicia injoyd at Bostria One Julian who did Christ truth display But by Severus forc'd to scape away To shun his rage Ancyra in Galatia did injoy The Gospell beams Dorotheus made there fly Opposing Errours, Knew when he should die, So left the stage. At Bostria which in Phoenicia stood Brave Julian was bishop who eschewd Severus Errour by his flight, which shewd His faith intire Magnus shone in Berrea sent was to Cosroes king of Persia now their foe By Antioch, who did intreat him t'do Away his ire The Rabbid King repli'de he would destroy The Syriaks and the Cilicks and doth high His host to Hierople, but doth spy The town kept fast Yields unto Magnus for a thousand pound In gold, to leave his War which Magnus found To be deni'd, and on himselfe a sound Of treason cast. Candidus Bishop Sergiople Crownd To whom Cosroes tendred Captives round Twelve thousand, for two hundred golden pound On's Credit gi'n Confirmd by hand and oath; yet could not raise Amongst his people in due time, delayes Are dangerous. The tyrants wrath doth blaze And siege them in. Candidus goes entreats him not bee hot The mony promised he had not got As yet: He takes him Captive and what not Is flung on him A double price now's set. Hence he doth pray Some be to Sergiople sent. And they Take all the Churches precious things away Which don't suffice Hence Candidus is kept in prison still As one that perjur'd is, though gainst his Will, And so not worthy th'Office to fulfill A Captive lies Domitian Bishop is at Melitine Prudent and Pious. Andrew out doth shine At Nicomede. At Ephesus Ruffine The stole did ware Simon was Bishop in Armenia Who Captiv'd was redeemd and had away These were the Asian chiefest shine, this day To us doth beare Europes Shine And now I'le bridge the Hellespont into Thy Quarters, Europe, and some Beams that grow On thy best Doctors binde in sheaves and show Them as they shine. These times are leane. Thrace the imperiall soile Yields but a few whose note is worth the while, Constantinoples glory wanes, greate spoile Makes it decline True Macedonius a shining starr Gives rayes of Pious Zeale that dart out far In holy Life, yet with him times do jar, The Emperor Creats him griefe, doth banish him, and then At Gangra doth by hands of Wicked men Let out his blood so stains his Diadem Bold venturer! And for the rest, botches of Pride and Sin, I overpass till Men as did come in, A man of Piety and worthy kin, Yet Agathon Romes Prelate did him dub with whom he Calls A Concill and on many bishops falls Doth Excommunicate them plucks off Palls Away begon. Eusebius sat at Thessalonica At Erineus that town of Thessalia Secundus did the holy word display And John did sweep Larissa's Chair from dust, in Epirus Philip and Zeno, and at Corinthus Adrian and Anastase; things ran thus May make eyes weep And passing on to Italy, the Chair Imperio-papall which all golden were At Rome this Century did all besmere With fifteen strings These Anastase the second did begin And Gregory the Greate did close their rings The worst of all before; yet best therein Of th'afterlings In Campany Benit the seconds rayes Of Piety beatify the Dayes Of Whom Totila sought to make a blaze But had not power Constantius of the Aquine Church was made The Bishop who Prophetickly is said Endowed was when that the Sword and Plague Did them devour Germanus gave Angelick Light Divine Made Lapua's golden Candlestick to shine Lucana's Church drank of Frigidian's wine Anconitane One Marcelline a Cripple did attende At Nursia Sanctulus his beams did send Out wonder working force. Andrew did lend Help to Fundane. Canusa's Church did ware Sabinu's rayes And Beneventa's had Barbatus blaze Who did Convert the Lombards in those dayes Who though baptizd. Ador'd Trees, idolls, golden viper which He Cut down and their golden Vipers fix Into a golden Cup, they leave their tricks Better advisde I'le Cross the Alps and into France I'le goe And pick some flowers that in its meadows grow And here Millain produceth Datius who When he to foile His persecutors in his journey great Unto Constantinople had his seate At Corinth in an house that was repleate With Spirits vile, Who being told hereof, repli'de, therefore It ought to be inhabited the more, Seing they outed men from't, ope's the doore And entrance made, Datius asleep, the Divell roaring falls Like swine and Lions. He wakt on him calls Well fare thou wretch. For thou delightst to gall's And thus hast said I'le set my throne above the north star bright, And will be like to the Almighty Might, Loe, by thy pride art made Ass like and like To filthy swine When thou to God wouldst not obedient bee. Whereat the fiend Confounded, way goes hee. His house an habitation now men see Of better shine. Trevers now glories in Clycetius bright, Born with a Priestly Mitre and his like Nicetius with a Cross endowd with light Of Prophesy. He saw by night God on an high mount stand And's Angells in watch towers and one to hand A Book and cited severall French kings and Plainly discry And said this so long lives and so long that: Foretells Change that to the realm should hap The other Angells said amen hereat At each kings name This Vision was fulfill'd its said. Still he The King Lotharius grown wicked, see, An Excommunicate doth make to bee. He's grown profane. Massilia did Serenus Bishop make Who their adored images all brake And soused was by Gregory the Great With butter'd lips Praysing his Zeale, but yet withall doth fling Its one thing t'worship pictures, 'n'other thing To learn by Pictures whom to worship, sting With Rosy slips. At Pictoirs Fortunatus who was fed With his Poetick fats, was bishoped, Alcimus at Vienna's Church out spred His pious rayes Gregory of Tours that greate Historian Was bishop there (too fabulous a man As well as others) Now Pretextate won The Gospell bayes. He bishop of Rothomagenians was Gainst whom Chilpericks kingly wrath did flash, But Fredigund the Queen it brought to pass Tills blood decayes, Holy Germanus streams his gracious Call Angelickly at Paris, Chilprick shall Who scorner was of Bishops, Cover all His tomb with prayse. Our Scullers now shall cut the Rhine to eye What holy fruites appeare in Germany Which are but thin, Upon whose brinke we spy Columban win Bavarians and the Veneds to the Faith Rupertus strives to gain still, but he hath No good success at first, again assaith And doth the thing. He lai'th the stone of the Danubean fold And Churches on the Rhine, and Worms did hold What he began. Moguntia honour should Sidonius. Carentius pious learning did display, In Agrippine: Solmus, Simeneus stay Remedius too at Colen, and make day Shine on them thus. Now ore the Apinine I'le take my flight To Spain: and here I on Chrysanthus light Who many of Spoleto makes Contrite From Idolls run. Gallicia wareth Martines glorious rayes: Leontius shewth in Portugall Christs wayes Severe in the Vale Interorm Displayes The Gospell Sun. I'le slice the narrow Seas, to England run And see its shine made by the Gospell Sun And here it is as bright as (when we've done You'l say)'s else where. Dubrick a famous man on th'Wey in Wales Then was Chiefe Bishop of the Welch, assailes With Crowns Victer and Arthur too, and sayls To Glory Cleare Eliud Bishop at Landaff did send Such Zealous beam of Grace as did contend Against their Luxury, unless they mend Their Lives, he said He should upon the kingdom ruin bring He dide for age; and Odocy did him Succeed. Caer Laons Church did Paul bring in And Bishop made. Melkin at Glastenbury shone indeed A Prophet, 'Stronomer, and much did read Of Geometry, did ware a Prophets weed And did foreshow The Restoration of the English Realm And of the true Religion at its helmn At last, though sorrows great did it orewhelm As all men know. Daniel an holy, learned man up rose At Bangor was the first of Bishops chose With Dubrick, and with David quite orethrows Pelagianism. Sampson an holy man had Dubricks seat At Menew and a Cup of poyson great Drank yet not hurt. Grace did indeed defeate The poyson given. Ethbine an holy man and learnd indowd With gift of Healing as in Authors shewd Iltute of Morgan learning great persude Told future things. Elvodugus of noble rank was chose Rector of Banchors learned Colledge whose Learnd pious upright Life so worthy shows It sweetly rings. Gildas Badonick whose rich piety Strikes through the loins of Sin most faithfully Whose sermons shew Gods Vengeance out doth fly At all for Sins. That Pears and Bishops, Moncks and Clergy were The Vant Guard of all Wicked acts, hence there They're plagued by Saxons, now from Banchor steers To Glory Swims Now David Noth, Earls Xanth's brave son up sprang Learn'd, Lovely, Proper, Pious, and out ran Four Cubits high, Bishop Menevian Ordained was, Which ever since is of his name the Heire, Saint Davids, and he made Pelagians bare By dayly Preachings and Disputes full fair That now did pass. He is Chiefe Chair man in the Synod Calld Through all the Nation. Arthur him installd The Bishop then at Menew as it falld To be in need. Wherein his holy sweat did issue out 145Till seven scoare years and five were wheeld about And then his glass was emtied, soule flew out, Death's day's decreed. Brave Kentigern a Pict king Loth's grand Child Whose pious Zeale so worthily up boild He taught the Gospell Grace most richly stild Salvation cleare To Brittains all, all Scotland, Orkney iles, Converted many and Confutes the Wiles Pelagius broachd, inricht with grace these soiles, What man is here? Was Bishop at the Elve in Wales, foretold That God to such that knew not God them would Deliver up, the iland emptide should By Pagans bee. Christs Cause should shatterd bee till th'set time springs, Then to a better state Gods grace it brings: 185When ninescore five yeares old his Death's bell rings At Glasco's glee. 560 He had Resign'd his Elwy Office o're To Asaph his Choice Scholar years before Who with the flocks Consent's Ordaind therefore And Christ doth preach And worthily, yet noted is as first Who Rome's annointing had (this was the Worst) His seat doth heir his name, its in it nurst, As stories teach. Theon was bishop now of London who Too much respect to Relicks sure did do 586 Though not to worship them, he thought not so, Yet did them keepe. Anonymus a learned man did shine, Searcht much the Cause why God the Saxon line Did make their Scourge, and made his pen Divine Into it peep. 590 Choice Dionote at Avon a Divine Profound, in learning, and his sermons shine With pious streams Rector of th'Colledge thine Oh! Banchor where Two thousand and an hundred students 'bide Which sucking of his breast he did divide In seven ranks as their greate Churches wide Were seven there. And though they calld were Moncks they properly Were scholars fitting for Christs Ministry. He also Austin very worthily With learning greats Opposed in the English Synod, tite Who strove to bring them ore with all his might Against their former customs, to Romes rites And huffing seate. Brenden did sprinckle Gospell light all ore Scotland and Ireland too from shore to shore Rector of full three thousand students: bore A seven years sayle. And found the Ilands called Fortunate, Dagane another learn'd a pious mate Opposed Austin, and his Romish state And did not quale. Patrick arose Scotlands Chiefe Bishop and Spent twenty years Converting Ireland, Reported is as pious up to stand Apostle theirs. And in these instances you see the gleames Of Graces sunshine through this Centry streams Although more dim than were the former beams They fill the spheres. The Shine of Divine Patience I having done with Graces shine whose twine More Coarse is spun the former run more fine And now I come to Patience of whose stock I take a roale well carded and to th'lock That at the spindle of last Century Doth hang, I laying it may spining try Whether its twine will not run out as fine Over this Century with such a shine As answer will, with such an overplus The last and lend to Graces web a brush. 1. While Pride and Passion Huffs up Prelats sleeves And makes their gowns to russle, till they leese The noise of Aarons golden bells i'th'din And that bright glory of these garments in The Cock bells of this rot upon their hearts They fight like rams with fury in their arts Dash heads together till their brain pans ring And brains fall out, Patiences Wheels doth spin Her glorious thrid most fine to guilt her Web And gilds it in the spirits this way shed. Out of this Quaugmire Jack-a-lanterns rise Leading poore Souls among all bogs like flies, Of Errours, Heresies, and superstitions, Schism, Persecution, Sins without remissions. This is the day (attend rich Patience here Thy shine a while) when Errours spruice appeare And shake their budget till there out do run A multitude like pismires in the Sun. Works now begin to be such worthy Powers As are Esteemd to rain down Christ-like showers To wash away mens sins, and justify Before Gods throne. (Here Patience signs, Oh Phy) To merit pardon; and Eternall bliss: And yet their pens some times contrairy this. They make Repentance mostly penance so Describing't by such deeds vile men may do. Angells and Saints they depper lackies make To run to Christ with suites they chanch to take From mortall lips, and on their knees before Gods firy face to lay them, and implore His Magesty. Brave Saints and Angells 'bout's Made pretty Babie Christs in swaddling clouts. Gregory the Great (great goofe) his blots thus ly We from the Corps most sacred of the high And blessed Peter do this Key transmit Wherein his blessing of the Chains doth sit Greg. 1. 12. Indic. 7. Ep 17. 1. 4. Indic. 13 Epist. 34 Which worn about the neck doth munify Us now against all of adversity He adds, saint Peter can even in all things Help here: hereafter too remit our Sins And saith, whose body here you've covered His suite in heaven shall your sins behead. Hence Prayer is pourd out in to their Cues Even from our tanckards, for this Health they use. As Anastase, so Gregory mentains Pastors are not to live with Women; gains No word for this doth he yet if they bee Their Mothers sisters, Wives it grant doth hee. It scarce was lawfull now for such to marry If any one whatever marride, tarry Not in this state but hastily ran to A monckish Cloister both consenting so: He is a Welcome Votary: Now the praise They of Virginity to heaven raise. Pope Symmachus the first compild the Mass, Decreed that Maids and Widdows that do pass Lib.4.Dialo c.Their Word for Continency should not wed, That on the birth days of the Saint now dead They sing out Gloria in Excelsis do Did Paschase's Soul in Purgatory stow (As Gregory saith) who was a Deacon vile, Did Anastase the Emperour revile; And Gregory taught that men at Deaths Fair well in 14 C. Job 1.22 Go some to Purgatory, some to Hell And 'fore Christ came he thought all men down went Unto Hells Cloisters, though clean innocent. Johan Diacon. li.2.2C.42 523Hormisda Pope none of the worst decreed Psalms to be sung by turns: and with a breed Of Ceremonies Saddle backt the Church. And in him men out Maosism search: Who Temples garnisht honouring the dead: He built Basilick Alb: but lavished Saint Peters Temple with a Silver Trabs A Thousand fourty pounds worth drild from's bags. 525John after him one of the best of th'bunch Temples did guild and them with gifts imbunch, Altars adornd with Silver, Gold and Gems Ravennas Jayle doth starve him in her dens. 527Felix the fourth up pears, doth preaching fly. Temples to Saints up raise the Mass imply Onely in sacred places did decree That dying souls with holy Oyle greasd bee That holy Dayes, Church Wakes be once a yeare, Kept when the Temples Consecrated were. He Athanase did Excommunicate Constantinoples Patriarch. Strange fate. 530Pope Boniface the second damns all who Before him were or after him should grow, That should or had endeavered to lurch Away the Priviledges of his Church. He from the Clergy separates the rest In th'Temples that he might them all divest From Votes in choosing Bishops: unto whom He suffers not the Clergies Crime to come. 532The second John Pope did receive, its said, A golden septer all with Gems enlaid, Six pounds in weight, two silver Cups worth seven Two silver Bowls worth fifteen: Tokens given Him by Justinian the Emperour The golden Pope doth pitch a glittring bar. 534Agapetus is next. Gregory assures Us he in Greece a dumb and lame man cures, Not in Christs name: but by Saint Peters powers His Clouds do rain Traditions down by showers. On Sabbath days Processions he decreed: Dies at Constantinople and in speed Brought in a leaden winding sheet to Rome: And in Saint Peters Church they him intombe. 535Sylverius next Hormisda's Son's impopde By Theodote the King without the Vote Of Clergymen, whom th'Emperess because, He suited not her tooth, Excild, and claws. 530And now about the Brittain Congell teemd A litter of Monasteries, is deemd In turning Banchors noble Colledge (where Christian Philosophers did shine forth cleare) Into a Monckry, out of whose womb, The Chiefe Monasteries of Europe come, Whose Eggs were took and hatcht in Germany, In Ireland, Scotland, France and Italy. The Popedome's torn; a monster's with two heads: 536While Sylver lives, Vigelius yet treads His dam with his Traditions big impresst, Orders his mass-mens faces to the East, Hews proper lessons out for holy dayes The Feast of Candlemass ordains; would raise Rome to be Cald the Mother Church, yet feele By falshood doth, th'edge of imperiall steele. When at Constantinople with a rope Rogue like about his neck (as it is spoke) About the town till even is lead then led To prison, and with bread and water fed, His Clerick train, were some exild, and some Made dig in Mettall mines, til Narses come And Roman friends addresses, them redeem. This Rhetorick schoole, Sir Pope, doth Crabbid seem. 554Alas poore Chair, just now wast made to Crack, Two ramping Popes squeezd in thee back to back Now hast thy belly empty three months space, Pelagius then the first doth take the place, Out of whose Clinck these fopperies do spring That Clarks seven times a day their Hours should sing, That Abbats right be chose: that Priests Mass say At nine a Clock at Quadrigessina. He Masses sold for mony: and did clame Romes Primacy the first, as if the same Were set by Christ: And he the Popedome steers Some say four; five; nine; 'leven; some twelve years. 566Now John the third is popiside, decrees Against his Predicessors minteries, That none be styld Chiefe Priest ore all or shall Be Universall Bishop over all. The laying on of hands too he Confines From all men but Episcopall Divines. He did ever Linus and Cletus neer Did ware the Keyes. Some say he lied here. 568Benit the first a Pope of four years sise Decreed that no man might in any wise A Wooden, Stone, or Marble Cross tread on. His days were sorrowfull. He's quickly gone. 582The Church a headless stump five month abides. Pelagius then the second backs her, strides Her saddle, when by Longobards hem'd in With's Cloake bag up behind him full of sin. Saint Peters Church with silver tables gilt With gold he trim'd: and other rich things bilt, Out of th'Church doores his marrid Deacons thrust If they their Wives out of their Doors don't just. 591Gregory the Greate the Popedom next doth ride A fabulizer and by such up cride. He's said to turn the Sacramentall bread To flesh before the Eyes of all there fed, And back again that flesh to bread: and when He cut the bread the blood gusht out 'fore them Johan Diacon li. 2.C. 4.42 All to convince a woman that denide Christ in his substance did therein reside Not found in many things, yea weighti'st things. For Merits, Purgatory, Pictures, brings To pray to Saints and Angels. Marriage he Some time would have Church men debard to bee, But when his Fisher full six thousand soulls Of Infants murderd from his fish ponds pulls He did reverse his Bull and sighing say Better to Wed than whore, then babes to slay. The Spanish Arians, Sicils Manichees And Alexandrian Agnoits straps with's keyes, (Long keyes indeed or hung on a long string) Locking them out of Church doores (Sin Checks Sin) A Canoneer he was, whose Canons fly Against the Brittains do, do them annoy. 596Austin his Monck and monckish crew do land In Thenet Ile whose superstitious hand Gains Edelbert and's Queen to Romish stuff And is Archbishop made at Dover huff, Depriveth London where that seat was fixt, And on the Churches now his wax is pitcht He crowds up on them Altars, Images Vests, Crosses, Masses, Bannars, Calices, Censars and Candlesticks with sacred things And Holy Waters, Pomps, Processionings, Tiths, Offerings and Books of Roman Rites And Ceremonies and such things (darke lights) The Roman Pascha and their greasy Thumbs With Cross in Baptism. The Anglish Crumbs Of German Pagans him attend and own For Bishop. But the Brittains Christians known Converted first by Joseph Aramathe And Choice Evangelists more to the Faith, Still Grecian and the Asian Rites attend Did him reject and his: his Rites Condemnd, And did mentain their Liberties intire Which made this Prelates Spirits all like fire, And set the Saxons on their backs who slay Twelve hundred of their Banchorans they say. But now to turn from Romish Dishwater May we not hope to finde what the Relater Delights to shew in other places done. I to Constantinople therefore run And here we finde such grudgings and like bran As grieves a pious pen these stars to scan. Tim Curst Chalcedon's Faith. John Cappadox A Cruell Treacherous Muckworm and his Chaps Did water for the Empire and did Call A Synod, stiled it Ocumenicall. But to decline such swill Tubs, this is plain The Writers pens now most are of such Vean As pewk out Elves of such a monstrous sise That Gibbits Faith, and Reason takes for lies. A drop of Which my pen bibd up and grew As Physickt, sick, and up again did't spew. And for the reader's sake a drop or more I now attempt to vomit as before. I first will Call Saint Bridgit, th'Scottish wench A bastard and a Witch, yet fame doth Quench These things, for she in Man becomes a Nun, Works Miracles, Rocks into Salt makes run Restoreth Sight to one born blinde, she turnd Water int'Ale, for Leprous beggars burnd With thirst, and Ale too into Water 'gain Nay as she prayd, an Angell also plain Dictating stands, a scribenet penning it, A Book was thus Compild and wholy writ. After this Nun, take Benedict the Monk, (The Benedictine friers sprang from this stump.) They say he raisd to life a young man killd By falling of a Wall, A Vessell filld With Oyle by prayer, a Dead man brought to life, A Leper heald, a Countrey man through strife, Bound by a Curst French Arian, loost as soon As he beheld him, And by night, not noone, Saw all the world, as in a Sun beame placde And saw the soul of Germanus, once gracde With Capua's Bishopprick, carried aright By Angell up to heaven. Happy Weight. Evagrius saith the godly Zosimus 526Of Sind anigh to Tyre, when down did rush Brave Antioch by Earth-Quakes, being in Cesaria in Palestine, the din Thereof did fill his eare, he down doth fall Falls weeping, Offring Insense, told them all Again, as going to Cesaria A Lion slew and eate his Ass in th'way, To whom he said he now must bare her load For him: whereat the Lion in the road, Came fawning to him, carrieth the same Till in Cesaria's stately gates he Came. That John who dwelt at Chuzica betwixt Jerusalem and Jericho there fixt Restord an Eye dasht out, took up again Yea by a springe and laid it on the maim And so it was restord thus by his skill And piety. Believe it sirs who will. When Anastase who then the Empire held 517Had Macedonius by's Cutthroats killd Nicephorus saith the dead man with his hand Did sign himselfe with sign of th'Cross (O brand) Appeard to one asleep and bad him tell To Anastase, I to my Fathers fell. But know thou, I cease not to pray untill That thou stand shalt before that Bar which will Not bribes receive, to strive with all his might With all those judgments that shall on thee light. Nicetius born with sign of th'Cross, the King Theodorick to Trevers seat doth bring, Who sign'd three men possesst asleep with th'Cross Who wakt, in Vomot did the fiende out toss Cast out of one a Divell, who out cride Within the temple loudly, (if not lide) That King Theodobertus now was grown A whoremonger. This Gregory Tours makes known. Martyrius of Lycaonia A monk whom Gregory the great doth say He walking forth to visit some doth finde A leprous man in's way with deep wounds linde With stinck all o're whom on his back he takes And Carries whom, who from his back there makes A leape in such a shap as Christ is shown Mankinds Redeemer, when of men he's known, And quickly after in Martyrius' eye He is cought up to heaven; thence doth cry On earth thou wast not shamd to carry me I'le not be shamde to heaven to beare thee But where, Martyrius, hast thy burden left? Who thus replide, What he had born and heaft He felt no weight in while he jogging was Strang thing if true. Here's monkery i'th mass. A Priest of Centumcell in Italy When he did bath a man unknown drew nigh And waited on him, drew of hose and shoes And kept them while he bathd, as Gregory shews, And thus he often did untill at last The Priest for to requite him did unhasp His purse and gave him of their offerings Two Crowns whereas his waiting man begins With sorrow to reply, Its holy Bread, I cannot eat it. Dominion had Over this place, But for my faults am sent Here after death to tend: But now Present It unto God Almighty for mee, nay And intercede thou for my sins I pray. If thou prevailst, thou shalt not finde me here This said the Spirit soon did disappeare. The priest goes home and spends the week in prayers To offer God the healthfull host ne'er spares. Then going to the bath he doth not finde His Waiting man. Oh! how's the Divell blind? One Boniface Bishop of Ferra (sayes Pope Gregory) when a Child the Corn convays Out of his mothers storehouse and by prayer Them filld again. And when a fox did bare Away a hen, he brought the Fox again And hen also by prayer Skip Pen for shame) And when his Church full poore did find by haile Their Vinyard of its graps were made to faile His prayers increasd within their press their wine To their abundance as in fruitfull time. His words did kill a scorner at a feast, And wanting mony for the poore, encreast His prayers to god and found twelve lumps of gold I'th'blessed Virgins temple we are told. Two Goths that to Ravenna went, Cravd food, He filld their Cask with wine which thus is shewd To last so long as if there had been in Their Vessell made a Constant bubbling spring. Pope Gregory gives this story of a jew Going to Rome from Campany, nigh drew To Appia when the night came on went in Unto Apollo's Temple (oh choice thing) That in the Descent at Fundana stood Where Andrew Bishop was, he understood, His heart misgiving him because the place Was such, he signd himselfe with Cross. Oh grace, And down he lies and naps it but his heart Did flapper much: sets him the Watch mans part. At midnight spies a troop of spirits vile Assaile the place, and one above the Quoile Of all the rest to whom they Baysence shewd, Who tooke account what evry one persude At length one out doth jump and doth relate How he in Andrews bosom movde of late Under the shape of th'Holy Woman fresh A great Temptation taking to the flesh Which that Cathedrall Don that did preside Over the Rest attends with eares ope wide And hath dropt there by him that yester night I won the Bishop, said, the Subtile Weight, That he began to flatter her. Whereto The Chair Imp bad him with his game on go And promisd him rewards above the rest, Exhorting him the Bishop to molest. The wakefull jew whose heart went pitti pat Lay trembling, heard the Ape Cry thus who's that Lies in the Temple, See, hence out one came And seing him signd with the Cross cry'd plain Vae, Vae Vas Vacuum, Signatum, too And at that Cry a Way flies all the Crew. The morning springs away, the Jew doth go Relates the matter to the Bishop, who Doth put away the woman and Converts The Jew unto the Church, who now rejects The world and in an holy pious guise Devotes himselfe to spirituall exercise. This true or no's a golden prop raist well By Gregory's pen, for Crosses fixt by hell. Gregory of Tours a worthy man indeed A garden gay, yet not without a weed Greate fables left, of whom men fables shew, Who holding out the golden Cross if true Onto a raging fire did quench the same From Fortunatus Pen strange thing now came. Pope Gregory the great arch as the Rest When a poor monk had horded in his Chest Against his monkish rule three bits of gold Bittrly bewaild it on his death bed, could Not gain a Shriving from this Pope but hee Gave a live ? to the old Boy, a Fee, And dead did in a dung-hill bury him, And's thunder bolts with lightning on him fling. Thy mony Perish with thee. Yet at last Thirty dayes after did amend this Cast: He having thirty sacrifices spent Upon him, fetcht from hell to Christ him sent, Which he by plain Eye sight in vision saw And also saw an Angell (Silly daugh) Like to a ship wrack man that him endowd To do such miracles as from him Crowd, To wit that by his word he heald the sick And Divills out of men possessed kick To bring back roaguing monks: that th'nags that those That followd them, sat on, the dens disclose Where in these runawayes lay hid; He made Divells that in the Arian Temple staid Run out before the eyes of man and jog Away appearing like a filthy hog. The following day upon the Altar came A Cloud that did the temple lamps enflame And on a day when this plump pope did stand About to pour out water on the hand Of Certain guests, one vanished away And in night vision following one did say The other dayes, me in my members thou Did entertain: but this myselfe ev'n now. Oh! strang delusions! How do these abound: The underpining of their shifts unsound As Mass and Purgatory, Crosses strange Relicks and prayers and offrings that range For dead mens souls, my pen doth blush to write? But on Gods Patience. How doth it now slight. These are a tast to 'low your realish more I think would cloy: the rest shut out of doore. 2 Heresies. But Patience onely is not here abusde, By Errours Great or small, By slight Confusd But if we Heresies set as a Glass To view her face in as a longe we pass Strange Glory standing in her face we should Enamled spie like Gem embost in gold The East and West, France, Italy and Spain Affrick and Iland too near Arian-staine. Th'Emperour Anastase and Emperess King Theodorick and his Queen, no less, Clearch, Hyperick, Agapit in Court Deuterius, And Anthemius in the fort Constantinople had of Prelacy King Thrasimund the Vandall, Lombardy Leonigild, yea Lybeans beside Their Faith have in the Arian blew pot dide. They did assert the son of God to bee Not of One Substance with the Father. He No human soul enjoyes, that th'Holy Ghost Is not God too. Which things are cursed most. The Eutychean Heresie and swill Shed first from Maniches bad Costerill Denying Christ to take of Mary Blesst Our Flesh: nor of the Father substance best Endowed was: and from the selfe same egge Sprang the Nestorian and Severian skeg, That trumpetted tantarroe all about That but one nature did in Christ stand out Pelagians now infested England much, Monothelites else where of such a smutch As gives one will alone to Christ our Lord Sadducees now sprung up above the board And up with other sins false Christs arose As Gregory Tours doth to all disclose, The stories thus. One by his Witchcrafts vile Of Biturick, went to cut Wood awhile About whose back a swarm of flies appeares He's thought to be a madde man for two years And rambling o're the Cities neer, at last He in the Contrey nigh to Arles is cast Where Cloathd with Skins he as devout did fall To pray're: and better to delude withall Some say he had the Gift of Prophesy, Hence to effect the richer Villany He goes from thence, and enter doth the Coast Of Gabala and here began the rost. He now lets fly that he is Christ, and that A Certain woman whom he took (a flat Delusion) he doth style, vile wretch, now Mary: Folke flock unto him now, not being wary. They bring him Vestments, silver, much, and Gold, He gives it to the poore, Oh Cheat most bold. He heals the sick, doth future things foretell Sends few to heaven: Damns the most to hell, By Divelish Arts and Witcheries out draws More than three thousand that espouse his Cause, Not onely Rusticks but of Priests also And now he plundring falls and plunders throw To such as want, Commands them to adore Him. But the Bishops he did threaton sore For to destroy because hee did dispare That they would worship him or for him care. And entring the bounds of Apella He at the Chappells nigh with's rout did stay, As Pitching's Camp as if he did intend To fight Aurelius Bishop there: did send His harauld 'fore him, naked, dancing there And Playing, shewing that he coming were. The Bishop startled is, sends dextrous men Out to demant the meaning of him then Of which an ancient man had who when he Should bow to sweep the way and kiss his knee Commanded to surprize him thus beguild Without delay, which while this done, they boyld With rage, do hack him all to pieces small: Thus fell this Christ: and scatterd now are all That with him came. His Mary too is Caught (Whom they as part of his Godhead had taught) And under tortures publickly declares His Whimsies and his Witchcraffts and his snares: The persons thus seducde by Divelish tricks Never returnd into their perfect wits But held him Christ, Mary a piece Divine And many rose all France ore of this Crime Bewitchd took Certain sorry women, who Like maddmen raging did profess also Them to be Saints: and made themselves to bee Preferd as greate ones, whom saith Gregory wee Behold and by rebukes endeavour do To bring them from there errour Christ to know. At Burdsaux another false Christ sprang Which was uncasd, before he'd such a gange. But if we put these things to gether do We must adore Gods Patience for its show. 3. Superstition. Now rub thine Eye and lend it mee and I Will take it in my hand, while I apply Myselfe to search the Gardens of these times To finde how superstitious Flowers did shine Of Patience dorst upon each leafe With gold In letters Capitall that it behold The same may, then I will restore the same To tell thy minde how brightest patience came. And here my Rambling Quill this oreplus flings Into the Basket fit for Men and Things And Men it views with superstitions hug'd Which are both Dead and Living, both thus Lugd. Superstition about the Dead This age hath got the knack to over Doe The Law With Coffin and with Cradle too. They Consecrate in France their burying place And Wash their Dead and some with songs of Grace Are had unto their Graves. Thus Chrotild Queen. Some do their dead with Ornaments make seen Wax Candles ore their Graves instead of Light Are supplements to Eyes bereav'd of sight. Glosvint another Queen lost by the Sun Had such a globe of Light over her hung. And yet this apish age delights to tare The Dead out of their tombs to give them aire. Saint Martins bones, Saint Julians too up turn'd And in Saint Martins Church at Tours are urnd. Saint Antony the Monk out of his grave They summon Alexandria to save Euphemia's relicks in a Marble bowle Chacidon keeps as body beds the Soule And Stephens Reliques being founde by Chance Are had about and unto Rome do dance. Elisha's bones in Alexandria And Barnabas his Body found they say With th'Gospell by his own hand pend are brought In such a brightness there to rest its thought. Pope Gregory sends a Little key found in Peter th'Apostles Corps unto the King Richard Wisigoth, having within't Some of his Chain, what doth his headship think? Also a Cross with some of Christs Cross wood And of John Baptists hair in't, Not his hood. Byzants brave Temple in a golden pot The Virgins Vest, Vaile, Girdle too hath got Nay Gregory the Great that bears that style Not undeservedly Can't Choose but smile Finding a spring of Holy Relicks lies In's Holy Throne stopt by his bum out flies When up again when's brich hath it enfumde And raised by the breath that thence presum'de Hence Saint Johns Coat, Pauls Chain his neck did ware And Handkerchiefs, Nay Coate, Hood Chaine rich fair, Of Peter fall into his hands. More still A Bunch of Keyes found out by pritty skill In Peters sacred Body put in's hand And he profuse thereof (as matters stand) Sends eight thereof as tokens rich to those He honourd much. Sure Peter wealthy shows He had so many Keyes: or hungry were And had good teeth, or broake them out, I fear, Or had a mighty swallow t'live on steel Or kept a locksmith in his secret keele He had so many keyes within. I thinke His Holiness lest he should wronge his Clink Kept most himselfe, or one the best of all, Lest that his Fatherhood should from him fall. But leaving dead mens bones a stincking stuff We finde them trick their shaddows out enough In Colours fair and picturde upon Walls Of Temples and Pope Gregory out balls At one good man that brake them down for fear Lest they proove shooing horns of sinfull geer. But to attend the soule that left behinde The shell for Worms, This age hath it injoyn'd To Call at Purgatory in its way And all its Counts to just, and recknings pay. A count is dropt of two arch Linguist-Nuns From Gregorys Quill that Benit quickly thums Out of the Church: They die Extraniate And buri'd in the Church when feld by fate. The Deacon at Comunion time thus spake Let such depart that are not to partake These buride Linguists hearing up arise And trudg away, the which their nurse espies And hints it Benit. He her bread gave she Doth Offerings make for them: and stilld they bee. The Centumcellan Ghost by prayers and Mass Him gave from Purgatory fire a pass. And such as are by Prayer and mass away From Purgatory halld as wracks by sea Are with a rope, when got to heaven bright Are made to bee small Gods with no small might. Now prayers are pourd out in their Cup and they Must friends in th'Court their purses penny stay Thodeliad makes John Baptist's Temple fair That she and th'Longbards might injoy his prayer And Intercession unto Christ. Now Cries Of Lombards pray'res his Worthy ears annoyes Hence prayers to Saints and Angells do throng in Making them Inter-Cessors to our king: And prayers are made hereby at this rich day At Dead mens Graves. Oh! Stincking sent this way. John Baptists day, Peters and Andrews too Pauls, Cyprians, Felix, from their eggs now flew The Ladie-Dayes now bud Justinian And Maurice hatcht them. Now also up sprang The Lenton feast and the Rogation day By Mamert of Vien, Alcame doth say. Superstition about the Living. But come we now unto the Living, see Them superstition hugs, as ivy th'tree As soon as e're they peep into the World They're in the arms of superstition hirld. The idoll Cross is printed in their brow Though not first usd, yet found in use grown now. But touching it, these days first ground this grist Of Babtism by any monkish fist They did baptiz and Cross but might not soile Their forheads as Archbishops did with oyle The Woman too must Churched be therefore That she may freely enter the Church doore And Holy Water too they kept, its said, By Gregory Tours, in Martins Chappell made And otherwhere. And holy Oyle to smeere The sick therewith, and such as feeble were And if once slide strange Penance is the fine As Genebaud of Laudune Church the prime Must seven years Penance in a sell attend Because he marride was, and so all mend. And other that was staind with Patricide Must to Saints places choice ore Seven years stride. Superstition about things. But now its full high day to dig for Springs This age allows of superstitious Things. Now garnisht Temples blossom out apace And Consecrated are to Saints. What grace? Peter and Paul, John, Andrew, Mark and Mary Philip and Jacoss Stephen, though not Clary Are templeizd and multitudes beside In ery place, as once were Deifide By Pagans, Jupiter, Diana, Mars, Apollo, Juno, Venus, Vulcan, Scarce Any that did Excell but have and by A Temple consecrate had to enjoy Their Godhead in, bearing the name to Whom It's dedicated, just so things now come Onely the Idols name is now a Saints Saint Johns, Saint Peters, Temple. What Complaints. Pope Symachus, Poore Peter, did up build Saint Andrews Church with ornaments up filld, A Silver Shed, and Confessory too Whose Pension unto sixscore libra'es grew, And silver Arches of three Pensionists Each one did of full twenty pounds Consist. An Oratory for Confession, and An Arch unto Saint Thomas Church did hand Them all of Silver and to them doth lay A Pension full of twenty pounds in pay. A Silver Arch, and Pension of the Sum That fully doth to sixteen libra's come. A silver rich Confessory for these Saint Cassion, Procus, Jacinth, having fees Of twenty Pounds: A silver Arch also With Pension that of twelve pounds worth doth goe. A Silver Arch and Confessory gay Of Saint Apollinaries and did lay A pension to't of thirty pounds well made, Unto Saint Sofies Confessory laid A Pension of full twenty silver pounds, Also Saint Peters Font, and (as it sounds) The holy Crosses Confessory, such Of Silver, and a Cross of Gold set much With Gems that hath of Christ Cross wood therein This golden Cross ten libra's to it cling. Two Confessories for th'two Scripture Johns Having their Arches Silver (thanks good Dons) He built even from the ground their Lodgens all, And them compleatly whether great or small. He garnist Peters Church with marbles ore Unto the very handles of the doore, He richly did adorn its Quadriportch With Marble and Mosaick Worke, brave Church. Hormisda on Saint Peters did bestow A silver beam that did amount unto Full fifteen hundred pound. Justin, Clodove And other Princes their rich gifts out drove Unto these Temples, Gems and Pretious Ware, Six silver Cans, ten silver Bowles rich fare Hormisda did adorn this with and now Saint Peter wares a silver Beard and brow. I weary am to shew the pomp and shew They in their Consecrating these out threw Accordingly Baptistories they have The most without, yet now Honorius grave Of Tarentine first heav'd them ore the sill. These Consecrated are with oyly skill. Now Consecrated Tables Altarizd And Consecrated Cups are idolizd. To name the Super of the Lord is rare Its metamorphosd. Mass is all the fare. The Super of our Lord it hath tript up Making't a Trolly-Lolly bit or supt. Communion Table Cloaths, Mass I should say They Consecrate. Call Corporalls do they On which they set the Host (the Cup and Bread) And make't a sacrifice for Quick and Dead A Charm or Spell to Cast out Divells though The Divell rather's in't, than outed so. Vigetius Pope decreed they should not say The Words of Consecration but when lay The Sacrifice upon the Altar there That's Consecrate in holy Vestment cleare, And with a mumbling voice whereas before That all might learn a loud voice up they bore Hence once as Gygas saith, upon a Stone The Priest ridiculously set alone The Bread now in the Camp ore which he said The Consecrating Words, and it was made Transubstantiate, and now before them all Mans bloody flesh appeard, they down do fall Destroyde by God, and if he do not ly With mass they now the dead mans mouth do cloy. This is the May day of Monasteries Wherein they blossomd: from their shell arise Like Hemlock budding forth from Banchor Schoole Converted thus, grew big, and on the stoole Papoose Monasteries teemd all Europe ore, France, Germany, and the Italian floor Scotland, and Ireland. Whence Monks like flyes Or Ants from molehills and vaild Nuns arise. Thanks Congill for this Egge. Wee pick it still: It yieldeth Abby-Lubbers, Dick and Will. But to return unto the Temple doores Behold they're Clencht with nails and keyd up ore With greate and many Gifts. Here wait also A Worship kankered all which doth grow Up into Massings, Singings, Exorcisms To pulverisings, Oylings, Candlisms, And such rare hits, however matters Chance, As are such jigs at which the Divells dance. Wax-Candle prayers, And holy dayes a Swarm Embers, Rogations, Lents Fast-feast, still-storm. Church wakes which first Greate Gregory up hoighted And Candlemass Vigilius pope first lighted A Rout of Ceremonies strange far more Than ever could be reckend for good store. Nay ornaments of Silver and of Gold And Costly Pearls these play houses do hold. Our Saviours Image ?ther of his Clay They stow the Temples with, and worship lay Upon it too. The Virgin Mary stands Impictur'd here by image mongers hands. Peter and Paul are made Church images By such as say thy are their linages, And pictures too of other Saints and such Esteemed so, though haply filld with smutch. Tapers give light, doctors Rush Candles pink Perfumes arise, things otherwise much stinke. White surplices, Albs, and Dalmaticks White Church Chests with iron band made strong and tite Are all inricht with here they rest in ease: (For blackness else doth most attend Church keyes) These Temples, though they steeples now have filld With Jack daughs nests to much, It's spring: they build: Yet richly are enlinde, through superst'tion With Kings and Princes Guifts, with larg addition. Justinian sent to John the second Pope A Golden Crown with Gems stuck in't (a Rope)! Two Silver Bowls: two silver shining Cups, For Peters sake. The Fishers Coate off puts. Brave Belissarius sent a Golden Cross Adornd with Gems most Pretious (wealthy loss) In honour of Saint Peters name, Unto Vigilius, How glorious Temples grow? The Picture of our Saviour was so rich Set in a Temple that it did bewitch A jew to play the thiefe and steale the same Whose pay, they say, upon his head soon came In vomiting of blood untill he dide, And if our Oracle don't us misguide Mauricius set a stately Diadem Made by his Emporess and Justins Hen Namde Sophie wrought by all exquisite Art Up in the Church. Pelagius did his part Who garnisht brave thy body, Peters fold, With Silver Tables richly guilt with gold. The Emporess Justinians Ladie sent A Golden Cross stuck full of Pearls in prent, To Sergius' Temple where rich jewells Chest In Sergiople Birds of Choisest Crest Chosross the Father Persia's king gaind this When he besieg'd the town, but failes of bliss. His grand son in distress to Sergius prayes And hath success, his pagan vows he payes To Sergius, sends back this rich Cross again With other monuments then tooke ? th'same Also another welthy golden Cross Which he with glorious jewells rich did boss Having his name bravely ingravd therein And reason shewing why he did this thing And shortly after other royall gifts For answering his prayer, which he up lifts Unto him that his Sira might have Child A Golden Cross three hundred pounds weight stild, Five thousand statures more of gold to make A Dish, Cup, Cross and Censer, to attake The service of his Table with, and to Guild ore a Unicorn in open show And other necessaries: and he sent A royall Dish of Gold wherein in prent Stood graven cleare his name and Cause wherefore He did the martyre Sergius adore, And deems himselfe an Happy man to have His name engrav'de in these rich Vessells brave. Now though this Pagan king did Idolize This Sergius, in whose Cloake the Serpent joyes Yet Gregory thy Bishop Antioch Receives the same of Maurice (Demons joke) Doth in great shew of solemness repare To Sergius' Temple, where they stowed are. But to proceed no fur in this greate shine Of gold and silver glory Pearld most fine Fit to be idolizd and to display Attracting beams that pullice men this way As by this Pagan Prince is manifest Who put his trust and pray'rs up in the Chest Of silver which the Dust of Sergius urnd Who though to Sergius, ne're to Jesus turnd. Accordingly you have it storid, when The first Chosroes Antioch burnt and then Came to Apamea, the people pray Thomas their Bishop bring the Cross that they Esteeming it their onely safety now Their lives under its shaddow down may bow And have its Company when hence they go He brings it out: they do about it flow. And as he flourisht it in open sight It is attended with a glorious light Of a greate flame like to a shining fire That did him follow as he did retire From place to place, this done was many times Its said their safty followed these shines, Whose picture in their Temples roofe was made And under it in writing all display'd. So Anatolius at Antioch A varlat vile when he did God provoke Tiberius the Emperor inquires Into his crimes. He to the jayle retires Unto the Virgin Maries image hung Up there, in prayer with hands lift up did run Which as they say did turn away from him As scorning to face such a man of Sin. When Childabert the French king did besiege Cesaraugusta, th'Spaniards did proceed And in sad robes with mourning great did round With dust upon their heads the Citie bound About with walls, and with them bore about Saint Vincents Coate to give the French a rout. They sing and say their prayres at midnight in The Temple and their Letonies they bring Upon the desk: Maurice the Emperour Did bearfoot come hereto, and veater far Gregory of Tours when one lay sick surprizd By a sharp fever, goes, good man advisde And prayes at Mammies Sepulchre who were At Catalaun once Bishop, worthy geere. Gregory the Pope one of the best Divines These dayes afford, the matter thus defines That Images are lay mens books, wherefore He pleads for such as pray at and adore Before our Saviours Image, they don't pray Unto it as a God, but in this way, The Picture doth as Scripture make Gods Son Into our memory most aptly run: And with his resurrection joys our minde Or with his passion swage them as we finde. Oh superstition! Wither dost thou still The God provoking droppings of thy Quill. Such dawbings and such ditchy doing are Enough to make a fever burn the aire And while such things take place revenge would plow Up all by roots. But Patience at this slough Doth plough her Cheeks so fast with showers of Tears That quench her firy sparkes and wash as 't 'pears, Her own pale looks therewith untill she stand All beautifull: behold her lovely hand. 4 Schisms Patience must beare the weight upon her back Of Prelates Pride and Shisms till it crack Whose Spirits fly like fire-Balls sulphurizde And with an hellish blast so sublimisde They 'to't go tooth and naile whose kiln dride ire Breaks out in rapid flames and all enfire. In Anastasius his rain, a grievous Rent Was in the Churches West, and Orient. Some stoode so stiffe to Chalcidons decree No sylable therein must bated bee With Leo's Tome. And on the other hand Synod and Tome Anathemaes have damnd. Another Cause hereof the Letters were Henotick Zeno sent of peacefull geere Which some approovde. Some deemd these buskins poore And no way fit to shut Dissention's doore. Hence East and West and Libya's Churches rise And break off Fellowship like Enemies. Another shism rose at Byzant who Explode what Alexandria's Church did do Which for Dioscorus upstood unwise And Chalcedon did Anathematize. Now Zeneas the Hieropolitan Doth Flavian vex, the Antiochian, Doth Charge him with Nestorian Heresy: Which he anathemating prov'd a ly. But Xeneaus, a man full turbulent When this string faild, unto another went And still unto another, (envies rich Of wiliness) untill he'd got a squitch That whipt into exile good Flavian And John of Plate also that worthy man, Constantinople's Macedonius As we assert it from Evagrius. At Antioch Severus who arose From petifoging to a Monke, is chose Their Bishop, who Chalcedons Faith destroyes He all good men doth anathematize Who held Christs nature Humane and Divine. Some Bishops under him to him encline Some he compells to yield who after Cry Pecca vimus and others else where fly Jerusalems grave bishop him withstands Cosmas, Orontes, and Severian. The Emprour Anastase causd in the Hymn Trisegion the Quiristers to sing Who for us Crucifide was as if thus The Trinity was Crucifide for us Which Macedonius full Orthodox As strange to Christian Doctrine gave a box. A Schism's made, the factious hire greate strength Come in the Temple singing out in length Trisagion who for's was Crucifide The next Lords day they th'great Church thus annoy'de. Now bloody noses grow, they take a monk Chop off his head concluding that he stunk Of all this mischiefe, thus the matter came To fire and Sword, the Emperour a main Came to the Hipodromy left his Crown And by his Harauld sounds he doth lay down His Empire, hence they sheath their swords and cease And pray he would retain his Crown in peace. Rome tore her Church to bits: a Senator Namde Festus, bribes the Church whose silver bar Thus pitcht, doth pitch the vote on Laurence who Not pleasing some: Some Deacons votes bestow On Symmac us, ordain him Bishop: and Thus to't they go to boxing slaughter, stand To't stoutly, Ravishings and rapine rage Full three years going for the bishops stage Peace Child: its Peters Chair and Heir, yet see How Name and Nature in this Pope agree True Child though all's as black as coals we trow Peters Chair vertue whiteneth the Crow. King Theodorick of an Arian Face Is made the judge of Peter and his Case, Who finding in his Quest the better part For Symmachus, he easeth them their smart, Stows Peters Chair with him. And doth assign Laurence the Bishoprick of Nucerine. This stills the broile a while, outs not the Coare Which festers four years, then brake out a soare Malignant now again, they Laurence bring To Rome again, this did inrage the King, To whom they Charge Pope Symmachus (Good Head) As boasting that he licence had, he said To sin with th'Charge of feeding of the Sheep And other Crimes. Good Father Pope most sweet! Theodorick offended layes him by And Laurence too, and doth the popedome tie On Peter Altins girdle, Cerberus Finds here such scraps as make him leape up thus Into thy Lap dear Mother. Pluto spares His Dog awhile now to attend thy Cares. Is Peters Chair thus metamorphosed Into old Cerberus with's triple head? But se these heads a fighting, Symmachus Doth by a Synod pack the other crush And while he worrid them much blood did fall Both from the Clergy's veans, and Flocks withall. And in the kings wide mouth these Collops trudge There's none but God may to the Pope be judge. That Peters Chair finds or refines the Bum That in it sits, and of it makes a Drum. This Symmachus his Predicessor rare The second Anastasius did tare Away from's Bishops, Priests and Clergie by Admitting to Communion one whose dy Was of Acace his dying that the stain Did rend this head and members all atwain. Pass we now to Justinians reign, and here Anthimus of Constantinople shiere Doth and Thedelze of Alexandria The truth of Christs Natures distinct away, Asserting he onely one nature had Shisms here by all in those Churches gad. The Monks at Nova Laura, like a web, Bestained are with errours freckled. Eustochy of Jerusalem did strive Therewith, and cast them all out of their hive Who flying all about did by their hum Draw many after them by schisms drum. Pope Felix dead, the Chair doth empty stand While Senate, do with Clergie hand to hand A squabbling fall and now they make it squeake Thrusting two bums therein. Good Chair don't breake. Some Choose and do ordain pope Boniface Some give Dioscorus the selfe same grace. Peter thy Chair a two-head monster lies Nigh thirty dayes, then one picks up and dies. Smaragd the Hexarch of Ravenna saw The Roman pride to sprawle out of their Craw To get the bravest Cushon and best place In all the Church of God their Stooles to grace Thought to prefer Ravenna and therefore Joynd to their Bishop John, there others more Of Aqua Grade and one Severus who Bishop of Aquileia (Schisms grow) Pelagius pope and's Romans swell and John And's Sociats as Schismaticks trample on The year scarce turnd about, but down they fall Upon their knees and ask forgiveness all. Good father pardon us this once and wee Will do no more so, then he did them free. John of Constantinople Maurice and The Grecians bishop make up high to stand An Universall Head ore Churches all Gainst whom the Popes of Rome do lowdly ball, And Gregory the greate this title sayes Is Usher unto Antichrist and's ways. Cato a Priest at Arvern, Bishop chose Not yet ordain, did threaton to depose Cautine, Archdeacon, who to shun the shower Into Theodwalds Court went as his tower And is himselfe ordaind the Bishop there. Hence utter enmity did head up reare. The Brethren torn a pieces are, some stand For Cato, some for Cautine, and each hand Do others Persecute. Patience we see By Schisms sore, sore exercisd to bee. 5. Persecutions. We now approach to see her beauty more In Persecutions that attend greate store Which while she sighs at, and at all the sin Some Drops of Justice sparkle do herein, Which slipt between her fingers and we spy The tears of griefe as pearls in Patience eye. The Ten horns of the brindled beasts Curld head The bottomless deep pit up vomited Do gore the Saints of God and Crimson grow My pensill will it draw out as I go Which first will tell how others persecute And then how these Ten horn such tunes do toot. First see the Scene of Sorrows others raise Ore which stands Patience in her blushing baise While Anastasius Empires it you have A Manichean Princk a painted grave Of Envy and Perjur'd hypocrisy. He Banisht Euphemy for piety Brings Macedonius in a worthy one Who by his wiles is also over thrown Whom when he could not bring unto his bow Gets some that slandrous Crimes upon him throw And Charge him with adultery, the which In open court to clear himselfe did twitch His Coate aside, did prove the Charge a lie Shewing his want of his Virility. And then another noose is for him set But in the same his head they cannot get But yet it matters not, he is Exild And murderd too at Sangra by their Wild And many more must pledg him. Some they cover 517 In banishment: some one way, some another. He banisht Flavian of Antioch Elias of Jerusalem of broke The Saints of Palestine exild, and wast Untill Gods hand his Venom soule uncast. Severe of Antioch the Jews imploide Who by their aide in CetoSyria stroyd More than three hundred monks, their Corps he made Carion for Crows, the Temples wast he laid Calades King of Persia's rage doth fry Against Christs flock, and doth the same destroy. Cuts out their tongues, who yet as pens descry Spake perfectly. You have't as cheape as I. Africk puts in her Martyrs Scrole now more Than full nine hundred dying all in gore. Here Thrasamund the Vandall king shuts up The Temple doors: sends that bitter Cup Of Banishment into Sardinia Two hundred twenty bishops drank that day A grievous brack at Rome that two popes made Became a bitter spring of bloody trade Each side did cruell Persecution fling At others and much butchery did spring. But pass we ore to Justines Scepter bright 519Which in five hundred nineteenth year did light A certain Jew who glori'd that he was The son of Moses did to Negra pass A City in Arabia Felix strong Did summon Christians there from Christ to come Which when he nought prevaild his tyranny Did very many there sadly destroy. And Arethas the Bishop of the place A Crown of Martyrdom did there embrace. When Thrasamund the Vandall King wagd war With Cabaon the Moore and in this jar Did enter Tripolis, in cruell fret And all base injuries afoot did set Prophaning of their Temple, did anoy The ministers, scourging them cruelly. 528But Justins sisters son Justinian Five hundred twenty eight his realm began The Analphabetist did well begin A cruell punishment on varlets fling And upon Pederasts, for off he parde Their Genitalls as things that might be sparde But after fell in th'Eutychean sties And monstrous Covetous did up arise His filching Craft did snuff the Wealthies' Light The Empire to Mechanicks farmd out streight Sold justice and for gain did theeves admit Murders and Butcheries, plunders do sit Unpunished and such as seek to fray Away these mischiefs are soon made away. And though he by John Patricks pains with aid Dorotheus and Theophilus here made The Roman Laws full easy (which possesst Two thousand fifty Volumns) now new dresst 545Which now come in small lumps and stild are thus Digesta, some Pandecta. Welthy plush. Or by the Lawyers now Justinians Laws Yet after all is said he's filled with flaws. Sore havock the Samaritanish Jews By Julian their King make and did use They temples barns and monuments with fire Most Cruelly with tortures out do tire The Christian now in Palestine and most About Neople where they did disghost Their Bishop with a sword: their pastors stroy And cut to steaks in frying pans them fry With martyres Relicks: at Cesaria In Palestine all Christians down did slay. The Vandalls kill King Childerick because From banishment the godly saints he draws And Gilimer with all his hellish wiles Not gainings Saints from Christ them sadly spoiles, Cuts out their tongues whom yet as authors tell Who did behold it, they did speak right well. The Jews again in Palestin do rise The Temples burn, and bring great miseries On Christians, the Lieutenant Stephen kill And at Cesaria his state ceise still. The Huns afflict the Churches sore in Greece And Plunder do the Thracian Chersonese. Justinian grows an Aphthartodokite And doth against the Orthodox now fight Exiles now Eutychius bishop grave And Anastase from Antioch he drave Had Death not quencht his cruelty and heat And made his persecution to retreat. 566Justinian dropping in Deaths pitfall and His nephew nam'd Justinian too upstands First liberall; but grew a Cormorant, Did snuff the Silver Candles, shunning want, Of Usurers and rich men, did excise The Churches and men very poore likewise, Cut of his Cousins Justins head asleep, A worthy souldier, Alexandria weep. Though many worthy things he did, yet hee Did many Vex. Now Antioch shall see Their Bishop Anastase Exiled upon False Crimes, a trick delighting many dons. Th'Armenians by Chosroes are distresst Who to the Churches was a grievous pest. 577Justinian languishing, Tiberius chose And on him's Crown and Royall Coate bestows With pious Exhortation in such wise As shews that in repentance deep he lies Chargd him beware that th'shady glitter fine And sparkling Robe him cheat not with its shine. As they have me who wretchedly now smart, Correct my sins I pray: justice impart To all and minde not these (pointing unto His Princes and his Counsellours a row) For they have ruind me (where at they all Amaizd let store of trickling tears down fall.) But see thou honour God and's Church which were Before thy Mistress, now thy mother deare Let each retain his own: give to the poore Observe all others and thyselfe much more. What thou once wast and whom thou now art minde Let my Example have thy Eye, be n't blinde. Remember whom I were just now before And whom I at the present am therefore And of these Exhortations a full Crop From the Imperiall Lips a pace did drop. Whereat Tiberius Cesar at his feet Prostrates himselfe and gives out speeches sweet If thou (saith he) dost please I am: but art Not pleasd here with, I am not, but depart: To which the Emperour replide, Let God Who made both heaven and earth and all abroad Imminde thee of all things that I have here Forgot to speake, teach thee's most holy Feare That all things may go prosperously with thee, And that by him thou maist have happy glee; Tiberius thus enthroned on doth go Gent, Gentle, Modest, Courtious, Just also, Wise, Liberall Mercifull, Godly, and Blesst And Valourous, second to none, the best. He Justins treasures scarcly justly got Did to the poore most liberaly allot But I forget my selfe. Patience smiles here. Whereas I am to bottle up here tears Which very many are whose scutchons hang On those ten horns which on the Beasts head sprang. The Persians war against him, hence great smart By Persick hatred pierceth godly hearts. But Good Tiberius we now entomb 584And to his Cousin Maurice do presume, Excelling in great Prudence, Piety, Clemency, Valour, Liberality And other Virtues in whose golden Rayes The Church lay running in her Halcyon dayes But black clouds do up spring the Persian ire Doth wast Armenia by sword and fire Doth Captivate bishops and people too At Antioch Greg'ry doth meet with woe. In Sicily Lieuetenant Theodore Did vex the Christians and made many sore Abusing of his power against the will Of's Prince (as Courtiers oft do practice still) A Persian woman namde Galanduch now For many years all torments that allow Great anguish hath sustaind because she would Not from the Faith of Christ let go her hold, A Crown of Martyredome most glorious gain, After her grievous Sorrows doth obtain. The other Exercise of Patience bright Upon the Ten horn'd Dragons heads do light Whereto my pen doth nimbly run ints race There to adorn rich Patience with her grace. The second sort of sparkling Gems we take Out of the Crowns the ten Horns weare to make Bright studs to shine in Patience's Crown most clear Whose glory thus we give to shine out here. Now first the Horn that gord the Alpine Coast Of Rhetia Prima German Prime makes rost Of the Bajorian Saints the Christians high From Ratisbon and th'Contries all that ly Verging thereon, they banish, wast and slay Their Ministers, in Ashes temples lay. Do freshen Hercules his worship, and The Worship of the Heathens by the hand 508Of Prince Theodo the Bajorian This horned bull the furious head doth fan. A second fury Patience mourns at stands Upon the Horns of Ostrogoths, and spans Now Italy, Province. Theodorick Staind in the Arian Dy fat 'way doth kick The Christian nobles Symmachus, Boece Wise Consulls. John Rome's Bishop coming from out of Grece With his Companions, Legates, prison'd are Now at Ravenna and by stinck bad fare Hunger and Thirst is slain and Orthodox In all his Coasts he vexeth with a pox. In th'second Justins day Totilas th'King Gods Scourge did havock sore upon them bring Prusium besiegd, the Bishop Herculane Upon the Citie walls beheads when ta'ne And fleys from Head to hell his skin off quite And held his hide out for a shew or sight. One of the soldiers, Arian wretch, slew all Both Monks and Clericks in his hands that fall. Cerbon Bishop of Populone because He hid some Gottish souldiers, to the paws Of a mad bare is Cast which did not bite But lickt his feet spite of Totilas's spite. This Horn yielding its seat's made Lombardine Which ragde against Christs saints in King Alboine Who entred Italy, swore he would put All Christians to the sword, and them off cut And fell upon the same, Temples destroy'd Slay all the Priests, Hangd Monks on trees up tide, Besiegd Millain, and taking it down fell All Christian Citizens that in't did dwell. Illyrian Christians now to feel this Lash Against the Bishops of their Churches pass, And Sicily is made to smart and Cry Many a worthy saint in jayle did lie. A third bright scutchon hung in Patience's Hall Tost by the Westgoths Horn in Spain I shall A little View as follows, For we finde Almerick king in Arrian Cups unkinde, Clotild his Queen of Faith true, Orthodox He doth with various sorts of torments box Whom as she often went to Christian Rites With dung and all bad nasty things bedights. At length he stripes her with such Cruelty His handcarchief did in his Wife blood dy Which he to Childebert her brother sends Which bred a bloody war between them friends. A Pagan Prince in Spain Abdila calld To bitter persecuting Christ upcalld An hundred armed ships at sea whose Chiefe Commander Manucha a vile Catiefe A most infested Enemy of Christ Who to give idoll worship now an hoist And root the name of Christ quite out of earth The Abby of Casina stroys. Here birth Is given to his works. All towns thereto Belonging doth with fire and sword out do. The Priests with various torments doth destroy Placid the Martyre with two brethren ly, One Virgin sister, three and thirty more All at Massane most Cruelly in gore. Hermingild too, King Lenichilds Choice Heire, Wedding Jugund Segiberts daughter fair Whom Eroiswinth the grandam kindly seems To Welcom now with a pomp meet for a Queen Yet when her Arrian flattring tongue doth meet A Pious answer that her Faith should keep Saying it me sufficeth once that I Have in the Laver which doth purify Of sacred Baptism from all the blot Originall and have Confess'd (why not?) The Holy Trinity in Unity And in Equality, Her rage grew high (I say now Hermingild) doth trouble Finde For Eroiswinth as one of Venom minde Doth snatch the Damsell by the hair and fell Her to the ground, and playes the Jezabell Doth spurn her, makes her all goar blood and bid Strip, drown her in the fish poole and her rid. But being saved by an hand divine Her husband doth Convert by pious shine Of Jugunds and Leanders sermons now Bishop of Sevill from the Arrian slough. Hence Levigild his Arrian Sire doth rage By Threats and Promises to disingage Him from the truth of Christ, all rotten twine That Can do nothing. Then he takes this line Doth abdicat him from the Kingdom and Of all his goods doth spoyle him out of hand. Invalid argument, hence on he goes His neck and hands with irons loaded throws Him into Prison very cruelly And sent an Arrian Bishop to untie His Arrian Points unto him preaching now But all this Rhetorick he with his brow Doth beate away (Dozde wood no building makes) His Cruell Fathers Axe (Steele without flakes) Is stronger argument. He gave Command: And out he's brought at Easter (heavy hand) To waite Christs passion, to the Scaffold led The Fathers Axe Cuts of the Sons green head. Oh! Cruell Father! Cruell Heresy! Patiences Cheeks grow red and blush hereby And Good Leander feels the Crabbid Claws Of the old Lion, falling in his paws And brave Jugund seing this tragedy Attempts for France, doth to her Father fly. But falling in the solders hands that kept The Frontiers 'gainst the Goths, that 'gainst them stept: By whom she with her babe is banished To Sicily, which held her dying head, Which being laid, her babe was had away To Maurice, who his sun shine on't did lay, But on the stage did at this season peer A dismall rage against true Christians here, In Spain raisd Exoiswinth who's otherwise Calld Goiswint, author of these Miseries. I to a fourth horn come on which doth ride A glorious shine standing by Patience side France Calleth Patience for her Garden breeds This shining flower nigh smootherd 'mongst her Weeds. And in the present limits up there buds More horns than one (though they're hardly knubs) But though they now finde one hath stumpt so wide As in its bottom all the rest do hide Yet then they sevrall were (though in the maw Of one they ly as eaten Corn i'th'Craw) And thus they on did go, and with their horn Did fan the aire, as they Christ sheep have torn. These with the Almans (two horns now) do joyn With Gotths, have Captains Leuthar and Bultine Two Almans, Italy invade, destroy Their Temples; take their golden vessell, fy, Defile their Temple do with Crhistian blood Their bodies ly unburide (Judgments bud.) Chilperick king of France doth pitch his nets Hating his Brother Sig'bert king of Metz, Commands his Eldest son Theodobert By Andover his wife him up to girt, And to invade his Kingdom which he did And Tours, Pictou, and other Countries big, He cruelly oppresses, Churches burns, Their Abbies stroys, Monks from their lives he turns, Their Virgins ravishes, days as bad sprang As Diacletians or Maximians, Did put away his Queen Andover cause She was her Daughters godmother 'gainst Laws Of Antichrist: which do forbid to ly With goddam of her own posterity, Did bannish too the Bishop who baptizd The Child: this causd was by his harlot prizd, Commanded t'kill King Sigibert his brother, Is stild a Nero, Herod or such other; His Cruell Tyranny on Christians fell Full many like a flake of fire from hell. The Bishops and the Ministers of Churches He did revile and with all sort of lurches And torments great did vex them as was wild By Fredigund his Harlot therein skilld. This Fredigund in boyling Malice steept Gainst Wise Pretextate till its venom reeke Did poyson so the King, that his hot ire Him prison'd then exild him: and yet higher For when, after some years, he was restord To Rothomag his holy Zeale implor'd Her in his Sermons to Repent which lance Upon her perboild Envie's bag did chance To let it out so that she hireth some The next Lords day to stob him which is done, While in Gods worship he engagued was Which being done it also came to pass The Church at Rothomag is all in black And one Chief senator smites on her back Her bloody fact, whose tongue to silence she Prepares a glass of wine for, th'Feate you see. In Child'berts reign, Divamius President At brave Marselles who his fury spent Against their Bishop Theodore who now Sought succour from the King, but yet must bow; Poore man! is snapt up in his journy and Tormented grievously by his hand. The Clarks now laugh, whose sins his Checks did gall, Like Wolves they on the Churches treasures fall And with their burning tongues him slandering wound Yet he to Child'bert gets, begs help and sound. He's sent with Gundulph the Lieutenant back To Marselleis. But Divame with his pack Keeping the gates reviles them both, buts strapt By Gundulphs souldiers, yet by bribes well packt Fair weather makes with this Duke Gundulph and Swore to restore the Bishop out of hand Unto his Charge. But then the Priests and so The Abbat who had causd Theodore's woe Under Divamius' wing harke as his Chicks Some sureties give, and bring the King their tricks And Gundulph being gone Divamius doth Sent to King Gunthran, breaking of his Oath He could not hold Marselleis. Theodore Brought now to rase the Church was made the sore. Gunthran inrag'd, the Bishops slips aside, But is trapand 's thrown on a horse fast tide And in disgracefull wise to th'king is brought. Marsellies priests with Church Wealth now are fraught But Gunthran finding him full innocent Him back to his with gifts again soon sent. These things a grievous fire 'twixt these two Kings Gunthran, and Child'bert, raisd. Strife quickly springs Another bone is thrown at Theodore For Gunthran Base, a Courtier (such are store) Of Chilpericks causd him in jayle to ly Because he lodgd Gundoald the traitor, why? Because he feignd himselfe the French kings son. But now Good man, his ardent prayers do run Unto the throne of Grace whence a most bright And shining glory filld his Room as fright His keeper did. He's to king Gunthran led With Epiphane who from the Longbards fled To void their persecution and back sent Again thus by the King to prisonment, Where Epiphanius dies but Theodore Proovd innocent his freedom hath therefore. But still the Pot doth wollop ore. Gunthran Seeks now all mischiefe, though the Worthy man Was in the Power of Child'bert, who t'allay The fire from flaming draws the wood away. Lieuetenant Rathare to Marseiles sent Who treacherously doth faile the Kings intent. He Theodore demands t'give Suretie And packt him to Gunthran his Enemy That he might charge him to appere before The Matisconine Synod of the store Of Bishops there to be adjudgd, mean while Rathare the Churches Riches makes a spoile Sells part and fills his purse with seals the rest, And make them prisoners, which thing when Chest In Child'berts Eare, he gave his fathers brother A Charge to intercede, lest in this smoother, Here Theodore should suffer any wrong And thus the greate and open seeds up sprung Of all intestine Quarrells and black jarrs Twixt Child'bert and Gunthran of foolish wars. But now Poor Britain thou must have thy sup As well as others of this bitter Cup Thy Pagan Saxon that thy Christ disdain When Octa and vile Cosa a new train Of Cruell pagans bring from Germany Thy Temples down are Cast, thy Saints dead lie No age nor sex are sparde, grave Theonius London's good bishop, And Thadiol thus Bishop of Yorke seing their flocks destroy'd The Ministers fall slain on every side Retire to Wales and Cornwall: all the land Save This, fall under cruell pagans hand Who utterly destroy the Christians in't Gurmund an Africk Pagan King did dint His sword herein and so this land lay void Of Christian Faith and on the Pagans side Till Austin Came Palled from Rome to win The Pagan Saxon unto Christ our King And making gain of some, grew proud and huff A Counsill calls, t'have Brittains use Romes Muffe. They send then seven Choice Grave Bishops to't And of the Wisest of all Banchors note Whose eye beholding Austins pride so greate As at their entrance would not from his seate Once move his taile, they did disdain his pride And did reject him and his stuff beside Which set his Monkish lambkin in such rage (As if a Wolfe was in't) he did presage Or rather threaton them; seing they would Not take peace with them; they in sharp war should Fall by that People seeing to them they Would not the Gospell preach, they should them slay, But this they do not heed: they would as soon Communicate with dogs as Anglish boon. Hence Ethelbert the King of Kent the Saint Of Austins mint, who dented (oh brave paint) With Austin for his Faith (Its handsell rich) Up stirs Ethelfride King Northumber which Joyns with him and a mighty power do raise Who take the war upon them, fly delayes, And draw their Pagan swords against all right Upon the Brittains and in Cheshier fight To Chester come Whose Consull Bremell there Assisted with an Army Christian, Clear, With many monks and Students worthy who Came most from Banchor Colledge him unto Which all Unterm'd three dayes stood praying out For Good Success: but yet the Pagans rout Stout Bremell and his army save a few That with him fled away, they slay, then flew Upon th'unarmed monks or students Rather Which Dinoth sent and do hew down together Twelve hundred on the spot. (Good Austin! thanks) This Pagan sword by Austins sparks them flanks. But alls not o're; though Dinoth and his Tribe Of Pupills martyrde are, the Pagans side Bought not the day ore Cheape; they many lost. More ore the Brittain Knights, to pay the Cost When that the tyrant drew his army up To Banchor do on every side him Cup With flames and scars that make his spirits faile. The Chiefe Blederick Duke then of Cornwale (Slain in the way) And Margabad the King Of Westwales, Cadwan King of Guinith, him Assault, wound, put to flight, and down destroy Ten thousand sixty six of th'Enemy. And though this somewhat runs beyond the line Of this sixt Century, yet in the time Of Maurice that Choice Emperour I hope I wrong not Patience here to lay it ope. And now behold these gleanings twisted in A garland well and hung on Patience bring Her glory out so bright rubd up hereby As to behold the same will breake the eye I therefore pass unto another shine Evn Justices, to decorate my rhime. The Shine of Justice Justice that dorment seemd to ly up starts As waken'd at these screeches, casts her Eyes Out from her Dormon Window. Now it darts Its fiery beames and from her Chamber flies And to this darksome age she doth thus say Hoe, hoe, my Glory comes to tend your day. Her glory's bright in all those Cruelties Whereby this Age Phlebotomized stands By Persecution for in apish guise Religion now is minted, freckled, tan'd, Now superstition, yea, and Wickedness Do mantle it, as Court and Churchmens dress. 500In Anastasius his Dayes While Anastasius held th'Imperiall Mace Vesuvius a Vomit took and spewd Out firy Embers in such store the face Of all the Countrey neere, and fruits all ru'de. An Earthquake ruins Liddicea, yes, Agathius, Hierople, Tripolis. A Blazing star lights the Bulgarian host Illyricum to ransack and destroy 507The Roman army and a fire did rost Constantnople and an Earthquake high Wasts Newcesaria, all save th'Habitation Where Gregory Thaumaturgus had his station. Clodove the King of France takes by the Crown Alaricus the Arian King of Spain Vicenna stream is made so deep t'will drown His host to wade it by a mighty rain. The night he spends in prayer, the morn doth show Them passage waded by a mighty Doe. Now on he goes, at Poicteirs doth encamp And saw a fiery turret breaking out And come from Hileries Church to him this lamp, Him spirited to give the foes a rout The Arians were Confounded and made blinde And he a Conquerour with joyous minde. Olympus now at Carthage, th'Arian Vile The holy Trinity did open ly Revile and belch against and rails a while But heaven let three fiery darts out fly Of frightfull Lightning and burn him in The Elyannesian Bathe up for his sin. 512About the fifteenth year of Anastase A Thracian Rebell did make havock greate An Earthquake greate did Rhodes brave ile deface Huns and Bulgareans make the East to shake With fire and sword. The Emperour is calld From heaven to repent untill he's galld. A Spectrum terrible to him in sleep Appears a book holding within his hand, And read it thus to him, Loe Sir, I sweep Here fourteen years off from thy life all damnd Thy Vile Beliefe and baseness of thy Faith Thus shortend thy imperiall scepter hath. 520At Alexandria the yeare before His days were done, Men, Women, Children too Possesst with Divells many were: did roare And barkt like Dogs. Which things as certain shew Fell out because he damn'd Chalcedo's Faith Yet no regard at all to them he hath, And kenning from Diviners that his fall Should be by Lightning. He Tholotum built And dwelt therein, but thunder through the Wall Crackt horridly, much Lightning slides a tilt He runs down stares amazd from room to room 521And in his bed room's found under deaths doom. In Justine's Times which began 521 But se how Justice guilds ore Justines dayes With her bright glory. Now a Comet shines And quickly after down an Earthquake layes Brave Anazarba in Cilicia lines. Edessa too a City of Renown Scirtus his overflowing streams do drown. But when the water fell there found was in Its banks a Table all of stone inlaid With Hieroglyphicks thus, the Scirt shall sing And basely dance with Citizens its said Halfe Pompeioples swallow'd up whose train Within the Mouth of Death, beg help in vain. At Naples in the Market place was raisd The Image wrought of hewn stone squar'd and laid In Colours gay with Varnish richly blazde Of Theodorick King who havock made Of many Saints and burnisht o're his time With blood of Orthodox and Arrians slime. God takes him now to task. His Image-Head Drops on its own accord off from its neck, Presaging of his downfall. He thus sped He's stoughd with griefs under and up on Deck. He deems the Fish disht on his table 'peare The Heads of such as by him cut off were. And ninty dayes after Pope Johns Death, hee Dies suddainly by Apoplex or Squirt. 527He leaves no Son. The Image still must bee The Necromancer out its belly flurts At eight years end and then his daughters son Nam'de Athalaricus, his glass is run. Soon after this, its secret parts drop out, Then dies his Daughter Himelswita shall And when the Goths besieigd the City stoute Its Thighs, Legs, yea and feet leap from the Wall O happy Omen! now the Romans say Who on the Siegers fell, and chast away. 528In Justinians Reign Vesuvius a bellowing now falls. The Huns do war upon the Goths indeed. A Dismall famin rages: th'Emelians all Leave lands and goods and to Picenum speed There fifty thousand die by famine, nay, Far more than these, beyond th'Ionick bay. Men feed on men they are so hunger bit Two hungry women seventeen men up eate Grass and Grass roots they feed on, thanks for it, And mothers eate their infants dead for meate The Goths besiege Millain: the Sieged's fare Is flesh of Dogs, Mice, Rats, and nasty ware. 529A Dreadfull Earth quake doth them terrify At Antioch, they therefore barefoot pray. A man by inspiration thus doth cry This Motto on your houses write to day Christus nobiscum, State, which when done The Earthquake Ceast and did no longer run 530Some Affrick Bishops orthodox in Faith, And Belisarius bangs the Huns by land Germanus soundly swops their sides by Sea. Then Captain Zaberg quarrells up doth stand 'Gainst Captain Sandichle and makes such frey That they their proper nation so destroy'd That th'name of Huns is wholy laid aside. The Vandals rage in Africk doth bring out Brave Belisarius on their backs who brakes Their necks in three months time and doth them rout Gilimer their King ? takes This Gilden ? Charriot studded thick With Costly Gems to th'royall town doth pick. And many milions of rich talents here In silver and the Royall precious Thongs Genserick took from Rome amongst which were The Holy Vessel which there Titus brings Out of the Temple at Jerusalem He to Constantinople brought, with them. Which when a Jew thus spake, these will not stay Out of the place King Solomon them made Unto Jerusalem they're sent away And in the Christian Temples ? up laid, Chosroes harrasseth the Eastern parts But Belisarius makes him feel his darts. The Visigoths and their Confederates For eighteen years turn ? in Wars But Belisarius over their pates And Narses, thunders till their brain pan jars But Narses smelling Belisariu's Fate And Sophie Spindles, opes to th'Langbards gate. In France things all when Clodove dead, do run In snick snarles. Clothair and Theodorick Fight till the stream of Aroad river sprung More blood than Water gliding down in't quick And ore the batell in the sky was seen An Angell with a sword drawn bright and keen. Chrannus King Clothairs Son the Saints afflicts Against his Father and his brethren wars His Father routs him; he for England ships There raises forces and mentains his jars. His Father routs his host, did siege him and burn'd His Wife and brats in a poor Cottage urn'd Clothair and Childebort seeke each to destroy And draw out armies each against the other; The battell's pitcht, but yet the tears and Cry Do reconcile them of Crotichild their Mother. They into Spain and fall on Almerick That did abuse Clotild as Heretick, Because she would not Arrianize her faith. They beate and kill him, take his Treasures, stroy Toledo his brave City. Clotild staith No longer there. They bring her home with joy. Justice Requites aright base Americk Otherwise Calld by some Amalderick. Greate Arthur ? gives the Saxons pay Wins fifteen pitched battells, his own hand Four hundred sixty soldiers down did slay In one of them, his Caliburn so mand That made them fly, their Cruelty thus came Upon their head by justices hand again. Justinian the Emperor who raist His cruell hand against Christs flock, because They's Incorruptabilian Errour razde And blew away, as hatefull to Gods Laws Fell by a stroake divine, in judgment sad Into a raging Furie, and di'de mad. Under Justine 2d whose reign began 566 Narles the brave Commander is accusd To Justine of Unjust and Cruell deeds. Sophie the Emperoress him much abusd She'l make the Stallion spin amongst her steeds And Distaft girls. Quoth he inragde, a Web I'le weave, she'st not unweave while wearing head. 568Hence he to Naples; Calls the Lombards in: In Venice and Millan and Italy They rage, and ravage and Alboin their King Kills Gundimund and marries instantly; His Daughter Rosamund, but of the Scull Of Gundimuld a beere bowl makes, fills full. And at a feast held in ? To Rosamund bad with her father drink In nipping scorn. She did so, but a wave Of Passion boyld like malice in't Hence ? with Helmichild her Maids Sweetheart To slay Albain the King, and do this part. 572Then she and he do to Ravenna goe And wedded are, but soon the Hexarch there Namd Longin motion makes of marriage to Her; she then gave her Helmichild her Deare A Cup of poyson drank he and [he] made Her drinke the rest and so their game was plaid. Now Persians breake their league and rage again, Soon pass o're Tigris and take Nisebis And it destroy, do to Certessium train[?] Put all to fire and Sword. What pitty is this? The Huns wast France about Thuringia Are beaten and do beate, Win, lose the day. Sig'bert and Chilperick go to't by the ears And Childebert layes Italy nigh wast. Chilperick out 'gainst Gunthran in arms 'pears Twenty four thousand flew, five thousand lost. Sig'bert at Rles is bang'd by Gunthran, and Soon stobd by boys at Fredagunds command. But Justine seing what his sloath procur'd Unto his Empire in a Phrensy fell Of which after a while he being Cur'de Emperializd Tyberius and fare well. This Great Pelagian of power defacd Rowld in his sloath and sin till thus uncasd. 577Under Tyberius begining 577 579Now Civill Wars among the Frenche Kings spring. Sig'bert, Chilperick and Guntrain make soake Their soils in blood. There shamefull deeds do ring Vile Ru?lene Chilpericks Legat smoaks Against Gods Saints, is pepst with harlots pox And him the following yeare justice down chops. Now Levigild, King of the Westgoths ragde And persecuted at Separtharia A Souldier that a grave man there ingag'd To smite his head off was struck backward, nay He was struck down by Gods immediate hand, Where at his fellows all amazd did stand. 583And now about for twenty dayes together The Clouds poure water down that many Cry, Another Noahs Flood is coming hither, The Loire, Flaver, Rhone and La Soan thereby And all brooks overflowing e'ry way Their banks did drownd and dammage great Convay. In part it Lions did demare and went In Italy with great tempestious gusts, Oreflowd Lugaria, Venice also, sent A many men and beasts hence God is just, Ore topt Romes walls, a mighty Dragon Dead And many Serpents stinking, by them fled. Whose stinck in Rome procurde a raging Plague The following yeare that swept hence multitudes Pelagius Pope was Chockt with't: and it made Locusts and Famine sore for they ensu'de: And Earthquake shatter'd Bordeaux, ran to Spain Reft the Pyrenians many hence were slain. Streets and great barns of fruits at Bordeaux and Brave Orleans are burnt by Lightening. Biturica sore pested by the hand Of Hail-Stones, yea and Bloody Fluxes spring And Austrigild, King Guntrans wicked Wife This fierce disease did separate from Life. The Wicked Earle Nantinus fell hereby, Whom when he for uncertain jealosy Of murder an Heraclius did sharpe fly And slew his Colleague very wrongfully, And robd the Church of Wealth, Heraclius Had Excommunicated. He dealt thus. He other Bishops did corrupt with bribes: They him absolve. He hence did Vilify The Churches Censure. Now God him derides After Heraclius from him did fly. For falling in this fiery Fevers pain With sorest screeches thus he did exclaim: Woe's me, woe 's mee, I sorely burned bee Thus by Heraclius the Prelate, oh! I am tormented by him, Calld I bee By him to judgment. I acknowledge do My wicked fa?. I do remember, I Unjustly wrought the Bishop injury. I pray for Death, that I no longer may Be by this torment sorely tortured. These Words he with a loud voice did display Then strength him faild, his soule out vometed. His Bodie dead was all to blackness turnd You'd thinke (saith Tours) it into Coale was burnd. 584Under Maurice beginning 584 Goiswinth the wicked Queen of Spain goes not Hence free, for judgment dasht out here one Eye. 586A Dreadfull Earthquak Antioch makes trot That sixty thousand persons did destroy And justice gives King Chilperick his pay His wife sent one at Cales that did him slay. Child'bert when Longbards ragde in Italy 592Maurice did hire him to unroost them thence And sent him fifty thousand solids[?] high And on he goes: his journey did Commence But going on, meets gifts the Longbard sent The which he took and back again he went. He paid for this erelong, a draught of Wine Did send him and his Wife unto their home. 596From January to September shine And dismall Draught. Locusts and famine come. A firy Pillar in the sky palde round With stars is seen: a Comet now is found. Pope Gregory this story pend, a Boy Usd through parentall fondness to blaspheme And Curse Gods name Even from his Cradle ly. He say ill spirits on him rush; a stream Him violently snatcht without controle From's fathers arms and took away his soule. Legate Rathare that Theodore abusd And pield Marselles Church God makes to smart. King Guntrans army, to such mischiefe usd, Are some assisde by Divels, and out start, Grew raging mad: Sing tantarums and some Seditious grew. Some kill themselves and bomb. Cajanus with his Avars, Huns and Sclaves Spoils greatly now with fire and sword untill Before Constantinople out he braves The plague at once, seven of his Children kills. Hence fearing Wrath Divine his Captives all He tendereth for pence a piece, price small. Maurice in passion will not give it. Hence Cajanus slew them all and home returnd. This Cruelty of Maurice gave offence His people hence with hate against him burnd This turned to his utter overthrow Of which in vision he was made to know. 603He saw in sleep before his Palace gate Himselfe stand guarded with a mighty train. And from Christs Picture and loud voice thus spake Deliver Maurice. Sergeants then him gain And set him fore the Purple Umblick there Which to him in his mother tongue spake cleare, Thus, Where shall I deliver him to thee? In this, or th'other World? Which heard he said Kinde Lord, Just judge, here rather let it bee Than in that World. The Voice then Command made That Maurice, Constance (whom to wife he had) Children and Kin Phocas have tendered. Soon after this the people tumult, take Deliver him and his to Phocas, who His Wife and Children slays 'fore him, who spake Lord, just thou art, thy judgment's righteous too. Then he was slain and from his body dead There issued forth milk with blood mingled. And thus we see the milke white glorious streams Of justice shining in these Instances And might fetch many more out of the veans Of this sad Century, of sentences. Some few you may observe as they forth shine In Miracles, which here I underline. The Glory of Divine Efficacy in other Miracles 518Melany, Albine, Marsus, Victor too At Anjou meet, in France. Melany doth The Euchrist offer to the rest who doe It take, but Marsus bosoms his which growth Into a serpents girdle, he again Gave't Melany and told him how it came. He bad him tell Albine what he had done And he again him sent to Victor thence At length its sent to Milany who run Doth unto pray're that now this serpent hence Might turn back here into the Eucharist. The which it did before he did desist. Evagrius saith there was a Jew who was A Glazier at Constantinople took Caught His boy and in an Oven hot alas Did thrust him, case with other boyes (what salt?) He tooke a bit of sacramentall bread: But was not burnt thereby, nor dammaged. At length his mother found him and inquir'd How he abode so long unhurt there. He Replide, a woman all in purple 'tirde, Came to me and brought water unto mee. She quencht the Coals next to mee, gave me meat As often as I hungry were, to eate. A mountain in the Rhoan, where on was built Tauredune Castle, bellowd sixty dayes, Then from a mountain by was torn, and tilt With its Inhabitants and Castle playes Into the Rhoan, whose water dam'd, back quoild And sought new tracks and many people spoild. Soon after thirty Monks about the place The mountain fell from, digging, mettall found. The mount fell lowing as before. Their pace Desisted not, before the mount did bound And rent again, and overwhelmd them there And made them pay for all the mettall deare. This sad Catastrophy insude upon Such Prodigies as these: four suns appear I' th'east, also the suns put darkness on That not a quarter of its light shown there. A blazing star peept fourth, also the sky Did seem to burn like fire tremendosly. 551An Elder tree did in Justinians dayes Its flowers, fruits, seeds transform to tender Vines 'Fore Africk souldiers did rebell the Rayes Of this bright sun were lost so that its shines Show like the moon, without its beams a year, Seemd grayish, then the Plague and Famine 'peare. Evagrius saith, I saw a Calfe new falln Ith second Justins reign that wore two heads. Sabellicus asserts the skies had calln Out Fiery Armies fighting in't, that shed 579Much blood, and many Inundations hereupon And Longobeards sack Italy, come on. In Paris twenty sun rayes from the north Appeare, that run into the west, and one Much longer than the rest up stretch'd forth, So vanished, and afterwards all gone. A radient star shines in the moon: and more Do round her in. She often blackness wore. About Chartres, blood ran from bread they broke. At Tours it did so too. Trees also beare Fruits twice a yeare and vines after the yoake Of Vintage, budd out yield new grapes and fair. Now serpents drop out of the Clouds with rain An age of Serpents now springs up again. King Guntran tir'd in hunting, lean'd upon His Armor bearers breast, and took a nap. Out of his mouth a creature small came, whom The Armor bearers sword bridg up, by hap, To pass o're from and to his mouth again, Which entring in, the King awakes amain. And as amazd, saith, I in sleep passt ore An Iron bridge, and underneath the hill I mighty treasures saw, searching therefore He found the same and gave the Church this still. At Daon was a Child born handless, yes, Eye and eyebrowless, with taile of a fish. Neer Venice was an Iland lake made blood. In January Roses ripe did grow. A Rainbow Circle round the sun there stood With various Colours. Ripe grapes also flow And trees too in December, blossom cleare. Strange things indeed, and make a most strange year. 597A Child is born at Byzant with four feet. Another with two Heads came unto light: Maurice his sword them on the Earth did greet And tooke them hence away out of mens sight, And fiery armies in the skies men viewd, Shining in blood of mankind which insude. Lieutenant Menas of rich Egypt in The Iland Delta about breake of day A man saw there out in the River swim With a Gigantine Face, Grave looks and Gray, Hair yellowish, Heroick Arms, breast, back, To th'Groin heavd out oth waves was seen by hap. His other parts hid with the watry fence As hiding natures secrets modestly. Menas adjur'd him if a Demon, thence To hast away. If otherwise, not t'fly Away before all they had satisfide Themselves with his Unthought of sight espide. Now taking of the Pens, that have translind These things to us, to give us down things true: We se Divine Efficiency how't shin'd In glorious Providence, this Century through, Unto the glory of Almighty, who Darts his Efficiency in Wonders so. The Glory of Divine Truth. But stay thou fleeting Century, thy stone Shall grinde the glory, till it shine, Of Scripture truth, things former shone, But fall within thy line. The golden Image still hath feet to make Thy Forge doth sweat, thy Billows play, Thy Artists welding heats do shape These toes of iron and Clay. The little Horn after the ten must bud, Thou Curricombst the Beast so well The nut thereof is felt to knub Now in the Flesh and Fell. The Light of Sun and moon and Stars must pinke. These litterally do so, you see. These Mystick are befogd and blinck These Civill tooke, dim bee. The Beasts greate deadly wound a Cure must have. All Pothecaries pestills sound, All Doctors, Plaster, seeke to save And heale his Deadly wound. The Beast must by the scarlet Whore rid bee, Hence Harnace fit and Ornament That fit the Beast and do agree With her in all intents. A Bridle must be had and Saddle made Soft for his back and for her Britch, With stirrups, Girts and Cruppers, laid On saddle Cloath all rich. Purple and scarlet too the Drab must ware All deckt in gold and pretious stone, And Costly pearles rich, choice and fair, She must indeed put on. And in her hand to hold a golden cup Filld with abominable things And Filthiness whereof to sup She makes her mighty Kings. Hence all trades busy are and operate. The saddlers make the saddle fit, The Goldsmiths wire draw their plate To stirrup and buckle it. Hence all Looms filld with twine to weave this Web Are knocking of the thrids together And Taylors making do imbed The robes with golden teather. The Gold and Pearls and Gems and Cup of Gold Kings feather do her nest withall Th'Abominations her Cup holds Priests in it let to fall. Pope Symmachus his spirits in it stills. Thus that the Clergy marry not, Vows of Virginity he wills Shall make a lasting knot. That Gloria in Excelsis be sung out Upon Saints birthdayes in his sphere, He squeezd his brains wrung like a Clout Till th'Mass plumpt in it were. He pounds his Crab, and prest its verjuyce thence Till Purgatory liquor came And Deacon Paschase must commence In't, hanselling the same. Felix the fourth doth make his dream in't boyle That Mass in places Consecrate Be onely usd and holy Oyle Annoint the Dying waite. He gives decree, Church-Wakes, with Saints birth dayes He Celebrated once a yeare He preaching of the word delayes Such drops from him appear. Pope Boniface the second brings his dram Decrees that Bishops Chafer bee Alone by Clergy men: doth damn Who make the Church a fee. Agapetas Sabbath Procession raisd Vigelius Praying to'ards the east Pelagius Primacy out Phrasd These Goosb'ries in it presst. Greg'ry the Greate the Juice of Workes wrings out And merits drops into it, he Makes Pray'rs to Saints and Angels spoute Into this Cup their fee. One and another taks such nick nacks fine Images, Altars, Crosses, Vest Surplices, Banners, Cups that shine Masses and Censars drest Oyle, Holy Water, Pomp, Wax candle-Light Masses for Quick and Dead more ore Guilt Churches and Monasteries hight Lies, Fatted, plump greate store, And such like things this Century doth press Their spirits out and put them in This golden Cup, as wine, yet dress It not up to the brim. Thus doth Prophetick truth beam round about Through this darke and soure Century While she the woman decks throughout To get on Cockhorse high. Sixt Century, good night, good morrow, seventh. I come here to salute thy Glory, writhen With various Dispensations, as rich trails Of shining Attributes, well packt, like Frailes Of sweetest Fruits, or Raisens of the Sun, Whose Casks must pierced bee before they run. But as my former steps were, so are these I'le strike the hoops off, that their breath may Weeze, And some few Rayes, that barrelld out of sight Therein lie lurking in the dark may smite Us with their beams, which thus upon us rise From Grace and Patience, Justice 'fore our Eyes And from Divine Efficiency and Truth, Observe their Glory, as the story shewth. The Glory of Divine Grace Sweet Gospell Grace, thy shine grown now more dim Than it in former Centuries hath bin: My Eyes deservedly may to my pen Be made an Ink bottle, And tears from them May be mine inke to write with, while my Muse A longer foot doth ware and sighs doth Choose, And rather bleare ey'd Elegies tones than Playes Musick in a Sapphick note and Pen. I therefore Change my verse and bring out Rhimes Tunde to the Melancholy Shape of Times. Where shall we find thy Glory, Grace to shine But in the Gospell Stars which dart its rayes We then for these will search first Asia's Clime And at Jerusalem where first this blaze Did glory forth there's little now a dayes. Yet God be praisd, some few doth still appeare In her 'mongst whom was Zacharias one When Persians tooke her and he captive were Full fourteen years, till they were overthrown: 624And then he was restor'd unto his own. Sophronius after him was bishop here, An holy man and Orthodox its said Whose eyes beheld the last destruction there Then by the Sarrasen Prince Haumas made Some other few are namde, not else displaide. Poor Palestine! How low art thou? Farewell. I come to Syria. Here Antioch Had after Gregory as stories tell One Anastase, whom th'wicked Jews did Choke With Excrements and many saints down broke. Alas poor Antioch! though some few more Thou hast on file set down its but their name. The Amathantines had one Theodore. At Rhinocare was Gregory who came With money Captives out of Persia t'gain. At Nicomedia Peter Christ displaid And at Apamea Thomaricus. At Cyzicum Stephen was bishop made And at Seleucia Macrobius. At Gortyn Basill, at Choos Geogius. John was at Philodelph, at Tarsus rose One Theodore at Ephesus another At Lydon Zimark, Sardis Marine shows Philalethes Cesaria tends, moreover And Pergamus Theodore wings do cover. At Laodicea Tiberius stands, Photicus doth teach the Gospe[l] now at Nice John doth at Chalcidon ope Gods Commands And others scattered in their Cities rise Ore Asia but in a slender Guise. Alas! Poore Asia! where is the shine Of Glorious Grace that first sprang up in thee? What is it thus obscured? Doth it decline And turnd a setting sun? I sigh to see. Farewell Farewell I Africk come to thee. The Africk Ministers Eulogius of Alexandria Did to Theodore Scribo leave his seate. He to John Almoner who sold away His and his Churches goods to purchase meate For Poore men and for Captives. Goodness great. Did's Deacon Damian Excommunicate For's Malice who did satisfy at length Luke were an Africk Elder. Carthage State Possesst Latinian and all the Strength Of Cyrus Phasis had. He had its tenth. Eulalius was at Cynople and now Taught Issidore at Abydos indeed At Aureople Theodore the plow Of Christ did hold and did attend with heed. This is the Crop, poor Africk, thou didst breed. In the Mediterranian Ilands Cyprus some few enjoyes. Stratonicus Ticon, Theodore, Epiphane and John In Crete Paul, Theogny, Basilius, John, Gregory, George, Euticius came on. In Taurick Chersonese beside George none. In Pontus John and Stephen, Theodore, And John Amasian and John Andrapine Are all the names we meet with; what more ore They bore we know not of the Gospell Shine Alas Poore Ilands, Where is grace Divine? Africk and Asia now farewell: I'le stride The Helespont and Europe's hand I'l take. I'le take in hand to search her quarters wide, To find the beams that Graces Glorys make Fall from the stars placde in her skies that shake. Constantinople when Cyriacus Who Crowned Phocas sore against his Will Had spent his Beams, Thomas Diaconus Did him succeed whose glory great did fill His Palace built most splendid by his skill. To him succeeded John, then Constantine In Doctrine Orthodox, their Lives not shown. Then Sergy, Pyrrus, Paul, in errours Slime Then Theodore, who's somewhat better grown Then George whose Errour he condemnd its known. German then followd him, whom Pogone quelt And Challynick came after in, whose Eyes Justinian dugg out, all in a pelt And sent him thence to Rome in such a guise Alipy in Adrianople lies. Some few we find in Thrace in Corinth and At Athens, Eubea and Sicily. Paul in Altinum and Torcellum strand Paul Petavine to Metamauke did fly And great Altine to Venice first did high. Whereas I now should measure Italy I finding Patience here so beautifide, I shall omit her glory till I ply A quill dropt from her Wing for to describe Her glory with, as coming in this tide. Some few in France I pick up take them here Trajectum had John Agnus whose reply When calld unlearnd, I as unfit appear As my dry staff to bear, which by and by Brought forth a lamb; he soon taught learnedly. Remaclus flourisht in this Church indeed With Piety and Preaching shined bright And Lambert too whose blood was shed we read Cause his rebuke did on King Pepin light For that he had a Harlot. Such will bite. Manswetus preacht good Gospell at Millan And Benit too a pious man of Faith Viennas glory Desidery came Because he rounds the Queen's vile sin, she pay'th Him first in Exile; then with stones him flay'th. Traviers is beautifide with Rodoald Arles with Cesarius of Holy shine, Eligius at Noviomage's instald At Senona Amatus was Divine Exild for sin reproofs to th'King and 'Ebron. At Mets did Arnulph flowrish whose cast ring Ith river was restord to him again Out of a Fish in token that his Sin Was pardon'd. Clodulph, then its said did gain The Place his father left, of pious strain. We may conclude France sparkled with more jems And of a better luster far than here Which in a lower orb of Grace's stems Shone in their day where of their writters geer Hath, looking loftily, not made appeare. Step we to Spain, Cesaraugustus shows Us Braulio and Taio, worth a name And Corduba as lean of stars, now grows Waring Severus of a learned strain Yet Isidore of Sevil learnd out came. Toletum's glorifide by Eugeny, Who of all western Churches was the light With holiness and Scripture knowledge high Then Ildefonse whose pains and learned might Struck down Pelagianism in its height. I'le stem the Rhine. Now Germany what cheare? At Saltsburge Rupert and his Consort shine, Who the Bojavians and others there Who nothing thought of Happ[i]ness divine Converted to the Christian Faith and line. At Renspurg Haimeran was abusde At Wirtzburge Lalian the Scot up rose An innovator. Victor at Worms musde At Colen Cunibert with learning shows Both sacred and Prophane, and overflows. I'le kiss my Native soile: In England see At Canterbury Laurence bishop sprang Honorious after him, Deodate hee Him followd now th'Archbishoprick began Then Theodore a Greek, all Popish gang. Berechuald then and then Berslanard came All tipt with Romish rites yet wrought their parts. Militus bishop London did obtain. Justus at Rochester, both these upstarts Were Canterbury bishops full of Arts. At Rochester these men unsu'de into seate Romanus, Ithamar, and Damian Putta, Chelmus and Bebmund, all grown great. With stuff of new religion, change began, Corrupting of the ilse by things of man. Northumberland Lights 652Pauline th'Italian went to Edwin King 13 Cal: AugustOf the Northumbers with Edelberg who Was daughter of King Edelbert to bring Her and towed her to King Edwin so He and his people he made Christian grow. He founded then Yorks see, and sat therein Built Lincoln Church on Humbers Southern side But when Cadwald, and Penda'd slain Edwin, He with Edelbert backt to Kent now high'de And left James Deacon in the see t'reside. Then Eddy Stephen up arose to sing. And now that holy Worthy Scots Divine Choice Aidan now King Oswald Calld, brought in Did fix his seate at Lindisfern and shine In Pious Preaching, Charity in's Line. Finnanus followd in Lind'sfarn Seate Who stoutly did oppose the Roman trash. And after him brave Colman who did sweat 664Against the Romish Easter it to dish In a Dispute at Ripon, and they Clash. Then Tuda who was pious took his place He first accepted of Romes Easter day And shaved Crown. Then Wilfride on a pace With Romish Relicks, yet did grace display In Lindisfarn, but on him troubles lay. Boso hath York for's Cure. Lindisfarn fell With Hagusted to Eata there to Preach Then Thrumbrecht gain'd Hagulstad to rule well And after him Chunibert doth there teach. His Bishops line over the same did reach. Lind'sfern to Eadbrecht came he's Bishop there. John comes to Hagulstad with godly light. Berecht was Deacon unto him we heare Of whom account is had which Bede did write Shewing the Story gi'n of John as right. Mercia's Lights When Dead Mercia's King the Faith receiv'd He was baptizd by Sinan Bishop then Northumberlands. He sought and up Faith heav'd By Bishop Diurn, and Collach both Scottishmen. Trumpery Oswy's kinsman followd them. Iaruman then succeded, Choice Devout, Whom Vulfry King sent to Sighery King, And his East-Angles all Apostates, out He did reduce them, down their Chappells fling Brake down their Idols, and to Christ them bring. Chad was his Fellow bishop who up fixt His seat at Litchfield as King Vulfery would Ore th'Mercian, Midland Angles Churches sits And the Lindisfarns. Then Winfrid did hold The same awhile. Then Sexolfe watcht this fold. East-Angles Lights. When Sigberect King of East-Angles were Baptizd in France and sought his people t'bring To Christ, then Felix a Burgundee there Came and the Roman Vizzar brough[t] with him Did vaile their Churches with, as they came in. But these relapsing back King Oswy sent Bernician Bishop Ced with others more Who them reduc'de, and Dhurches gatherd, lent A lift to Temples, gave the Sacrament. This did at Ithancester and Tibiburgh And for unlawfull marriage did expell An Earle the Church, when Sigberecht his Spur Would not restrain from judgmen[t] rang his bell When feasting with him down he murdred fell. After Jarumans reformation came One Boniface. Theodore after him. Then Baldwin halfe, the rest did Bisy gain The Synod held at Hereford doth bring His name among the rest that were therein. The West Angles or Gevissi's Lights At Dorcester Birine was Bishop, who Did Conigild King of the Gevissi Or the Est Saxons over varnish so, With Romish Ceremonies flush whereby Bede there Conversion doth to him apply. Then Agilbert the Franck from Ireland came Sat in this seate awhile; but in a tutch Wafts ore the main to France. Then fell the same To Vine, who sat at Woster, but a smutch Be fell King Cynigild. He dropt from such. He thus apostatizing, Vine goes hence To Vulfery the Mercian King, and buys The Bishoprick of London, did dispence His Light therein; after the Gevissies Have Elutherius of a French sise. He rulde them many years and by his aide, 678Maildulph the Scot founds Malmsbury Monastry And so laid down his hilts as its said After he had restor'd the Gevissi With Cynigild from his Apostasy. Other Lights in England etc. Ronnan a Scotman bickerd for Rome's rites 'Gainst Vinnan of Nothumberland, in vain, Edelwin, Litchfields bishop whose delight Was in the Holy Scripture truth mentains. Adelhelm Bladwin learnd, was with foule strain. Both Ecberecht, and Vitberecht did shine In Ireland, and thence set out to draw The Fressers unto Christ, in vain next time King Egberect sent Wilibrod to awe Then, with twelve other by the Gospell law. Who by King Pipins help, did it Effect. And at Trajectum raisd his bishops seate. Ivo whom Cuthbert of Lindisfarn dect With Principles did the Armoricks treate Converting many by the Gospell greate. Segenius the Scot whose Pupill was That famous Aidan, spoken of before, Dispensed Gospell Light that pure did pass, These were some stars, through which the beams in store Of Gospell Light did round this Century o're. And thus behold, how Gospell Grace out beams From Coast to Coast, but most in brittain cleare Against Romes pride, Prelation, and foule streams Of superstition, Easter, Shap'd-Crowns giere 'Gainst wedlock, Clergie, things that fulsom peare. 628When Edwin the Northumber king receivd The Faith of Christ, His Nobles, and his Realm Did too. Then Coiffy his High Priest bereav'd Of's Pagan rites, a stallion strides, and stems And all his Pagan Altars overwhelms. Now Peaces Coate with such a glory's lac'de That brazen bowls at every fountain Chaind None steale, but drinke therein, as they are plac'de. A woman might without disturbance gaind, Pass loaded hard with gold from Main to Main. When Oswald had his Throne, When Aidan preacht He did it to the Flock interpret cleare. Unto the Poore his pious Zeale out reacht. When at his Table he the Poore did heare He sent them all that for the feast dresst were. Nay and he took a silver Platter, brake It all to bitts, and sent it them also. Clodove the King of France, in Famine greate The Silver Roofe of Deny'se Church did throw All down, and on the hungry poore bestow. Grace too now over Pagan Saxons shines Inlargment gets in Holand, Germany. In Freesland, and in other Seates, and Climes Though strangly dim'd with vain, foule maumatry, New Christned in the Font of treachery. Se then how Graces rayes brightest are fogd With Jack-a-lanthorn lights sprung up and raised Out of the bogs of humane brains beclog'd With Superstition: now I half amaz'd Do pass to view how Patience forth hath blazd. I come to Patience now, and take the lock Hung on last Centuries Spindle, and the stock The Present Century gives I'le lay thereto To spin her twine drawn out this Century through That we may se how fine the same will run And how her Glory rises, being spun Through Lying Wonders, Errours, Superstition Contentions, Cruelties, and Romes Ambition, And such like things, that so we may adore The Everflowing Spring of Patience more. Patience exercised by Lying Wonder. A Wonder 'tis Gods Patience should Contain, While lying Wonders wollow out in grain, But now behold these file do Patience Steel Untill her Shine aboute the World doth wheele. 613At Maurien in France a woman pray'd Full three years Constantly as it is said, That John the Baptist would her bless ev'n so As on her one of's members to bestow. But all this while the baptist heard her not Then sweare she doth, she will not eate a jot Till she had gain'd her suite. Hence seven dayes pass She doth in pray're and Fasting, now it was The Baptist loath she should, poor heart so dy, Bit off his Thumb, most shining White (Fy, fy) And slips it on the Altar, which she spies And takes it then rejoycing: out soon highs, Declares the thing: three Bishop hast thereto To worship it, three drops of blood then flow Dropt from it on the Altar Cloath, as each Might have a drop, amazd, as goes the speech, They stand, an yet enravisht are with joy, And out they goe and up such Relicks Cry. 619When as Kents King in wicked wayes did rowle And outed Austins mates that touch his soule For Wedding of his Fathers wife, Lawrence About to fly, lodging as flying hence Then in Saint Peters Church, Peter appears And scourg'd him soundly, Charg'd him down with fears He to the King ith morn doth shew his sore And scourges saying these Saint Peter gave And Charg'd me never from my Flock be drave. Hence he his Idolls left, and was baptizd Calld back Melit and Justus and them prizd. Greg'ry the great, is said to give rebuke To's successour Sabinian who rook And slander did him, and did after smite 640Him on his head, whence sprang his last good night. When Dagobert King Clothair's Son did Chase In Dionysu's Church, (which too did grace Rush to, and Elutherius martyres bright) An hunted hart, they savde it from his sight, And after this he sanctuaries there, Flying away to shield off's Fathers speare They bid him build their tombs in greater State That people might them better venerate And for reward they promise him they would His Fathers Anger from him back with hold. Hence out he goes and battlements all ore Saint Denyse then with solid silver store. But now it being to be Consecrate A Leper lodging in it did this relate He saw Christ, Peter, Paul, and Denyse too With Rustick, and Eleuthery come through And bad him tell the Priests it and they take His Leprosy and to a stone it glew To be a witness that the thing was true. Some think this was a trick that by the Priests They for its Consecration be not fleec'de. 645John Insulan told Pictairs Bishop he Was by a Rev'rend Senior bid to bee At fervent Prayer for Dagoberts poor soule For whom that instant dead the bell did tole Wherefore he fell upon it, and soon spide An host of Divells in the sea so wide Toughing the boat in which the Kings Soule was Passing to hell. Hence he Cride loud alas Oh! Martine, Mawrice, Denyse, Martyres help. Then rose a storm and showers did often pelt And those three Persons all in white who said They being calld was come Dag'bert to aide And forth with took from torments thus his soule And bore it with them to the Heavenly pole. In Dagobertus time livd Agil, who When Satan in a Dragons shape came to Lift up his head, and Poison on him spewd Did varnish him by signe of th' Cross then shewd. 642When Haumar Saracen the Temple then Began to build up at Jerusalem, His enterprize was all destroy'd he sought Unto the Jews to tell him what they thought. The Cross, say they, which on mount Olivet Was o're the Temple, doth thy building let. Then down the Cross doth go, and up he highs His building and it stands. Report then flies Among the Christians that the Cross availes Against all Evill things, against all ailes. ??4And now about the Emperour Constans rose Against the Lombards, to an Hermit goes First to inquire. Who long entreats and Cries To have an Oracle at length there highes Mich the Archangell, John the Baptist, and Saint Peter, who this Oracle him hand. Go tell the Emperour God is not pleasd As yet to grant the thing thy heart hath seisd. The Italian Lombards can't be Conquourd yet Because a foreign Queen they did permit To build to God and to John Baptist raise A Church within their borders, with rich layes. Here men, and handmaids, Priests and all apply The worship of the Lord most faithfully. That John doth for the Lombards intercede And they his birth daye yearly therein plead With Offerings for this Oratory, though The time will come when it shall not be so. But it shall be despisd of all, and all Its Wealth they shall cast out, they also shall Afflict my Servants, and mine handmaids there The Priests that serve God night, and day even here Shall be molested, and their wealth shall be All tooke away, their lives imbitter'd see. And then this nation shall be overthrown. The Hermit to the Emperour did go The morning next, and made him all to know. King Oswald slain at Maxfield gave arise Bede 1. 3 C. 9. 10 To many stories Beda's pen up hoist That in the place he fell, a king was Cur'de And then a Maid that th'palsy had indur'de. The Dust thence tooke heald many sicknesses The post he hung on had no blemishes By fire that did all other things there turn To ashes quickly that there did burn. Upon his Relickes there abode all night From thence to heav'n streatcht out a stroke of Light Which then was seen in Litchfield province cleare. Nay by the water that did wash them, were Possessed persons healed, and dust tooke thence Chast divells all from men possesst. (brave sence), And at his tomb a boy was Cured who Was Fever sick, a man from death raisd too. 652Brave Aidans Cruch sav'de in red flames, they say, Cur'de many sick, diseases drove away. Such as were sick of Fevers and diseases The Biere of Eartanwald (as Beda pleases) Did heale, hee London Bishop was and stood Oh lying Wonders. Satan here deludes. And Fursous now about an Irish man A monkish Visionary clinkd his Can. Did Angels in his Extasy behold And a darke vally under him, its told, And in the Sky four Fires nigh equally A distant each from each. He now doth cry, What mean these Fires? An Angell saith these shall Burn up the World. One must on lyars fall That their baptismall promise over slip. Another Carnall Worldlings shall whip. The third shall roast all janglers; and the last Shall have ungodly persons in it Cast. These fires so grew they make one mighty flame, And nigh him got. He trembling out cries came But hath this answer, that it shall n't thee burn: Thou hast not kindled it, yet it shall turn And try mens deeds, and then an Angell rose Parted the flames, and twain on each side goes. Then Divells through the fire flew to enfire Wars up against the righteous with desire. The wicked Spirits him accuse, the Good Defend him, which once ore, three Angells stood, By him, who to the body him Convay'd, The other being fled to heaven its said, But drawing nigh the foresaid fire, there came An Angell as before, parting the same But coming where a doore lay ope betwixt The Flames, the filthy fiends a person fixt There in the fires, whirle at him, and him smite Upon his Cheek and shoulder by that weight. He knew the man thus thrown was one, whose vest He when he was departed, had possesst. The Angell Cast him in the fire again. The fiend reply'd, Cast not off him you've ta'ne For as ye of the Sinners Goods are heir So of his punishments ye ought to share. Not so the Angell said. He tooke this not For Covetousness, but as its justly got To help support his life, then dy'de the fire. The angell turnd then to him, and spake higher That burns on thee that thou didst take of his. And told him how he must shun all amiss. But when this man in body was restor'd The marke the fire unto him did afford, Though given in his Soule his body bore Most visible, as long as life therefore Remaind, he would to all men open shew A wonder strang: surely more strange than true. Another of such purgatory props Heare how it from the same mans lips out drops. He being dead in Scotland his Soule Is had by Angells to the heavenly pole, And there is kept all night and back its sent, And in the body once again is pent, And after this when dead the Angells led Him up to heaven, as he thither fled The Divell did him way lay then with whom After a mighty long brush he's ore come Because he had a certain Vile mans Vest, And back the second time he's also presst. Into the body, there to satisfy Among the living for's iniquity. Oh Furseus where is thy face, and brow? ??8Patience doth blush to finde thy bull thus low. Blinde Audomar is said to gain good Eyes By Vedasts Vertue, at the bishops Cries Who lost the same again because he tooke It ill, that hed his blindness for's health brooke. ?60When in a Famine sore Clodove the King Took down Saint Denyse Silver roofe to fling Some Spills of bounty to the hungry poore To feed them with, its said Saint Denyse bore Him greate ill Will, hence he soon fell mad And two years after Death's goad made him gad. ??4When Sussex first sat in the Gospell Shine And bright Eappa ore it stretcht his line: A sore mortality therein did rage. He and his pupills thereupon engage Upon a Triduan Fast to supplicate The Majesty of heaven in this state To spare the sick, or when they could not stand, To save their souls from being ever damnd. Now in their Hive there was a Saxon boy New won to Christ did of this sickness ly, No small time bed rid, who was left alone Upon the second turn of fast dayes, t'groane, To whom the Chief of the Apostles came Bout two a clock that day. (Here lies the game) Saluting of him thus, Child feare not Death: For we this day shall lead thee hence from Earth, Unto the heavenly kingdoms, onely waite A while till Mass is o're, they Celebrate, The body and the blood of Christ must bee Thy food Viatick till thou come to glee. And being quit of sickness, death, and all Wee bring thee to Celestiall Pleasures shall. Call to thee then Elder Ea'tppa, tell Him this, the Lord doth take your prayers well And your Devotion: no more shall dy Of this Disease, now in your Monestry Nor in the towns about, but shall revive Even all of them that are this day alive, Except myselfe who must anone be freed By Death, and to the sight of Christ make speed. But God hath dignifide you with his Grace, Through Oswalds intercession, of Blessed Face, King of Northumberland, belovd of God, Intently serving of him all a? Who by the Power of temporall Realm and so Of Christian Piety did fore you goe. For on this selfe same day by's Enemy He fell: and went unto Eternal joy Sociated with Elect, in Heavenly stories, And they to mass went in all Oratories Of the said Hall, with thanks their prayer heard were And for King Oswald who had reigned there. And that he for them as his own had pray'de, Then they the Heavenly Offerings assaid Thus ending of their Fast, refreshment take Into the body pincht with ? But when the lad Eappa all had told He askt what men they were he did behold. Quoth he they were all brigh[t] in face and dress Most Chearfull, Beautifull, I do confess I never saw the like, and thought there could Not any such bright persons eyes behold. One like a Clerk was with a shaved Crown, The other had a greate large Beard hung down: One was Calld Peter, th'other Paul which were Our Lord and Saviours Ministers, sent here By him from heaven for the safe Defence Of this Monastery, then out goes thence. Eappa searcht his Annals, it was the day In which King Oswald slain in battell lay. Calld all together, Celebrated Mass And chargd the same should to the sick lad pass. Which being done, he soon gave up the Ghost. And hereupon this Monestry indeed And others rounde about began to heed And Celebrate with Masses ev'ry year King Oswalds birthday. Se the Monckry here. In th'Countrey of Incanning in the land Northumber, as Drithelm there did stand, Fell sick, and in the Evning dies, and while His Wife and Friends with tears and sorrows boile About the Bier the morning after, he Reviv'd and rose; all affrighted he doth flee He calls and saith unto his wife, feare not In truth I am from death, arose, and got To live again with men: not as before, Then up he gets, and to the Oratore Continuing there in prayer, and doth divide His State, a third doth to his wife ascribe, A third to's Chi[l]dren, to himselfe a third Which to the Poor he quickly doth afford. And freed from worldly Cares he packs into Mailros's Monastry shut up also Nigh in a Cranke of Twedes brave river cleare Is Abbated and with a shav'd Crown there Continues till his dying day contrite. As was most fitting unto ? a weight, In heart, and life, and many things doth finde The which he most conceald: yet one thus goes, A glorious person quoth hee, came and throws This speech out, lets walke silently due East And so we to a Vale came as we prest Still on, of vast Length, breadth, and deapth possesst Which on our left hand lay. One side on't was Extreamly terrible with flames that flash, The other side Extreamly terrible With furious Haile and Snow most horrible, Whirling and overturning all things there: Both filld with souls of men that tossed were From side to side by th'fury of these gusts A recompence unto their sins and lusts. Th'Intolerable Flames did make them leap Unto the other Side where th'Cold so Great Did make them skip again into the flames. And thus they torturde are in endless pains. And while I saw innumerable Ghosts And Ugly Spirits in those torments rost I thought this might parhaps be hell whose flash I oft had heard intollerable was. My guide before me said deem no such thing. This is not Hell these soules are tortur'd in. He led me all amazd to th'further side Where suddenly all Darkness did us hide. Wherein I nothing saw except the shape And Vest of him that thither did me take. And going on in darkness through the shades, There wallop up oft balls of Flames t'invade's, As leaping out of a Deep Pit profound, And down they flap again with dismall sound. And here my guide slinks from [me] suddenly. And left me here where balls of fire out fly And down do flap again, in which I spide Men's spirits wafted up, and down beside Which those flames vomited like ashes light And smoake, which fell down in the gulph from sight Again, and in these vapours issued out A Stinck incomparable all about. And while I trembling stood and what to do I could not tell, a dreadfull sound came to Mine ears of Cruell wretched Weeping, and Of yawling Laughter of Fowl Spirits Damn'd To se the Souls of men thus ban filled There in these fires, and never Cancilled. So far as I could know one of these men A Shavling was, Clarke like, another then A laick, and a Certain woman too Was there, and these the Wicked Spirits drew To tumble in this pit of burning fire. Then Horrid sound did less distinct me tire. But some of the Black Fiends ascended yet Out of the flame spitting deep Whirly pit Surround me paw upon me gusting out With flaming Eye: from mouth and Nosthrills stout, A stinking fire, and threat'ned mee to take Proabing with red hot tongues from th'firy lake. I thus shut up on evry side with foes And blindness great of Darkness, my Eye goes Me round each way, if I could succor spy, And back the way I came here I descry Therein a Light as of a Star that shines, In darkness, which grew lighter in its lines, Which when it came unto me all these fi[e]nds With firy tongs are scattred, fly like winds. And he that brought me hither now appears To Chase them all away. Thus farewell fears. And turning on the Right hand way, begun To have me to the Winter rising Sun. Now soon he led me out, darkness goodnight, Into the air of a most serene light, Where I espide the fastest wall, whose length This and that way, and height's beyond Extendth: Without Gate, Window, Stares, whereat amazd, Yet on its top, I knew not how, we're raisd, And lo, there was a Field there lay most wide And pleasant too with fragrant flowers beside, And such a Light, that was more Cleare, full soon, Above the shining Day, or Sun at noon. Innumerable Packs of men and thrones Of Joyous troops possesst it for their own. And now methought this Heaven was which I Had often heard held out, top full of joy. My Guide replide, This is not Heaven, nay, But going on I spide before me lay A greater Grace of light by far than this, Filld with the Voice of Singers most sweet, yes And fragrent Oders wonderfull, that that I felt before seemd very small thereat. And when I hopt to enter in't, my Guide Stood sudden still, and back again did slide. But turning back, when we came nigh unto Those joyous Mansions of these spirits who Were all in White, Knowst what these things, saith he, Are, which thou sawst? I answerd No. These be Saith he, as follow, lo, the Vale of Fire And Cold, 's the place where those that do expire Without repentance till last gasp, are tride And in their Souls Chasetisd, cause then they Cride. And in the judgment day they savd shall bee, By Prayrs, Alms, Fasts, and Masses of men free Done for them here. But that Flame belching pit Is Hells own mouth, none in't get out of it. But that floriferous place wherein thou spidst All sparkling Youth most beautifull reside Is that wherein the Souls are welcom'd which Went from the bodie forth in good works rich. But such as are in er'y Word, Work, thought Compleatly perfect, shall forth with be brought Into th'Celestiall Kingdom when they die, To which this place of sweetest songs lies by. But seing thou must turn again to live With men unto thy body, se thou give Thy selfe to such an Exact, perfect life That after death thy Soule with joys most rife Unto these mansions of blesst Spirits may, Conducted bee without all Stop or Stay. But speaking thus, I did detest to goe Back to my body, being enravisht so With sweetness and the Glory of the place, And with the Consorts there mine Eyes did trace. Yet durst not ask my Guide a jot hereof. But soon I know not how I was steerd of And finde myselfe With men again am brought. Beda Hist. Ecc lib. 5. C What monkishness is this? Oh mischiefe fraught. Poore Souls neglecting faithfull Teachers bright Turning to Romish Ceremonies our plight Are quickly gulld thus by the Divell who Turns Monk and Ape to mock them so and so. 694Saint Sebba, Beda said, spied three men gay Who told him forehand right his dying day. Whose Coffin all of Stone to narrow by Four fingers for the Corps im'ediatly Grew larger of itselfe and took it in. This was a Miracle: or monkish thing. Its irksom here to amble through the store Of monkish sloughs, my Patience waits no more These lying Wonders: for in ev'ry Crink The Divell plays hide, and seek, while mortalls winke. And under ev'ry leafe He and his lies Do ly, that patience makes her Glory rise While he by monkish stuff beguils souls thus. Wherefore I leave this head and farther lash. 2 Patience made shine by Errours. I come to Errours Hogshead now whose broach This Centrey had, wherewith it did approach And tap the same drawing her Canfulls thence Up to the brim all foming frothy, Hence I'le poure out that of Heresies, and brew It well with that of superstitions hew Now in my Urinall thereby t'divine The very Simptoms of this sickly time And by these two this Verdict's on the Case That Patience blushes at their brazen face. Heresies. Hereseis whiske it now, as formerly In Tissues, Silks, and Sattens, trimly ly. Not many New ones minted but those stale Are new fermented and made bottle Ale, So full of spirits if the Cork's but slackt They all aloft fly and Gunlike do Crack. The Arian swill tub Rechar'd King of Spain And Fortunat Grad's bishop do mentain Ticinum's Anastase, John Gerundens And more too many for my pen intence. Now the Severian tree though fore now Cropt Springs up with many strong Limbs. Being topt With Centobabdites, Theodosians Petrites, Angelites and Agnoetans With Cenonites and Headless Dons also Who mongst themselves to daggers-Draw did grow. The Aphthardoticks still above bord stay The Monophysits rise and raise greate fray. Heraclius the Emperour's such. Oh fy! Its Arianism in another die. This thorn bush brancht also into these limbs Armenians, Jacobits which Gnaphe begins, With Theopaschits who assert do this That the Divinity did suffer, yes And Staurolatfits who adore the Cross. Pelagians now also do vend their dross Nestorians, Priscilianists too are Still in the market setting off their ware. These and such heresies as these do ruffle Gainst which as other sins, Christs truths doth scuffle. But while these nasty Dunghills send out reecks Patience doth shine with lovely Cherry Cheeks. Superstitions. I might here brand the Errours that do ly Luld in false Doctrines lap for Heresy And as I stem the Currant in the Seas Of Superstitions, I may plump (if't please) Therein such dross as I upon the same May Chance to strike upon: but now I aime In Superstitions Glass and Foppish Crimes To eye how patience's Glory higher climbs. Romes bishops chiefly do the Scullions stand That scoure her very bright with durty sand: 604Sabinian last Patriarch of Rome Who tore at Gregory now in his tomb Decrees Canonish Hours; and ringing bells: And Lights to burne ere in the Temples-tells It must all wayes be in the Vatican 607And Boniface the third nine months did fan. Romes Universal Headship he obtaind Of Phocas who by blood the Empire gaind. 608Then Boniface the fourth comes in and takes Sir Phocas with your leave, and Consecrates 609The Pagan temple Pantheon which hiv'de All Pagan Gods in't, and is by him shriv'de Of all its Idoll Gods, on Martyres stowd And Divells now which scourgd such as there flowd That Christians were, abate their stripes do there. Good reason why, they friendship make He here Doth annually upon his All Saints day Novembers Calends, fixt then mass to say. He did Decree that Altar Cloths shall bee Of Linen clean: and white spred on them. He States Monks a Sort of priests, and on them sent A Power to preach, and give the Sacram[en]t. 615The Seat nigh Six months void, then Theodate Is shuffled in't, who heald now Consecrate A Leper by a Kiss (such smacks are rare) Decrees that Parents shall no longer pair And be divorc'd, if for their babes they go As Sureties when baptismall waters flow. 618Then Boniface the Fifth comes in and Cast To Monks good Keys to Loose, and binde as fast. Honorius then comes, who builds a new The ruind Idol temples in chang'd hew, Invents the Exaltation day of th'Cross The Invocation of the Dead. Such dross. 636Severus follows him whom Isack now Exarch of Italy Confirm'd. How? how? 637Then John the fourth who did the boddies bring Of Anastase and Vincent: and them in Saint John Evangelist his Chapel hide 639From th'Saracens by th'Lateran fountain side. Another Theodore is pop'de did see Wax Candles blesst on Easter Sunday bee. 647Martin next Pope doth Constance now up risen 652To th'Empire Check for Monothelitism, Constance commands Olympius Exarch then Of Italy to kill or send with men Him Prisoner to him: who could not do't. Then Calliop is sent, he binds the Pope And brings him to Byzantium, they there fleece His tongue, and hand off, forcd thence t'Chersonese In Thrace an Exile is to's dying day. He orderest the Clergy should not ha'e Long hair. That bride and bridesgroom may not ly Together, 'fore the Priest them wisht much joy. The Clergy to say grace before meat and Oyle sacred yearly made by bishops hand. Martin in Exile Empty stands the Chair Full fourteen months, after his death's day were 654Eugenius then pears in't who first decreed That Bishops prisons get for such as need That Priests, Deans and Archdeacon shall not wed After two years the body lost this head. 657Vitalian gets thereon, and soon doth send To Constance Emperor who him Confirmd. He did Ecc[l]esiastick Rules Decree Church Musick too, The Organs as they bee Makes all things in the Churches out to come Prattling and canting in the Latine tongue. 671Adeodate comes in: and after him 675Donus another of the selfe same tin. 679Then Agatho hath thirty months the Chair, Belies Chrysostom making th'Mass his heir. Damns Mari'd priests and John Archcantor sent To England t'sing. The Church of Rome (his tent) Can't Erre, and all that would be sav'd must ly In Snug Communion with all her fry. He gave another Leprose Curing Kiss If Martins Chronicle don't speake amiss. 683Leo the second ten months pop'd it, made Decree that folk to kiss the Pax, displaid. 684Benit the second ten months more, who is Confirmd by Constantine for him, and his. 685John Quintus follows him another yeare 686Then Conon hath eleven months the Chair Then Sergius skipt in't from off mens backs While Theodore and Paschall go to thwacks To win the throne but lose it for it lights In Sergiu's mouth while for the bone they fight. He's said to finde in Peters Chest a piece Of Christ Cross Wood which he bids men like geese, Kiss and adore. Makes Agnus Dei sung While Sacramentall bread doth broken run. 701Sergy good night. I'le back again return And lick mine Orts o're, 'fore I them hence Spurn. Temples are now adord, and stufft to th' skin, With Chests, and dead mens bones: Calld Relicks: Sin. Wax Candles, Images, Fonts, Altars Nay Redwall King of East Angles, Bede doth say, Had in his Chappell set Christs Altar, and The Divells Altar too; therein did stand. Masses and other Romish trash: from which Many departed from the Temples rich When preaching were with prayre all over, lest They should with Mass idolatry be pest. The English Nobles, potentates, and King To heare the Word, and Prayre their presence bring: Which being over, then they did depart. And so it were else where, this vext this art. They pray to'r'ds Temples, Altars, Pictures gay, To'ards th'Holy Land, Monastries, nay pray By Graves, and Monuments. And now are found Mattins, and Even-Songs greatly abound. Constantinople's Synod Sixt decreed (As Polydore relates it for their deed) That Images in Churches be in store And worshipt too; as lay mens Battledores (To which the Romish she, lights Candles and Burns frank Insence and so doth give Command) This Counsill also order'd that the saints Intreated bee to treat God on our 'plaints Whom they ordain'd as Ministers shall have A staffe put in his hand (the rod they gave) Thens made a Chair man, While they Cant and sing But Exorcist, when made, a booke wherein Are writ their Exorcisms now receive. He must be Palld that to Ordain hath leave. Toleto's Co?cill eighth this Charge displayes, That none eat flesh in Quadragisimaes. Nunries now Spring. In Tanet isle arose Mildred with seventy shes, young Nuns, suppose. At Witby in another Ile, there sprang An other built by Oswin King, whose gang Congelda was the Mother Nun, beside His daughter Edelf red had her her guide I'le go no fur, My Pen its patience quite Will faint away if on I should delight To draw the thrid and make her shuttle run Ore all the Web unto the very thr[u]m. But by what here is done we cleare may see Patience by Superstition bright made bee. 3 Patience Exercised under Ambition I come unto another Fist that box Doth Patience on the Eare and on her Chops. And yet [i]n stead of Swelling at it, loe Her Face with Shines of Glory rich doth grow. Pride and Ambition by abusing her Do glorify her by their bloody Spur. The Roman Prelates swell with pride so great As if they all eat poison stead of meat Or like a pair of strutting Bagpipes blown Make musick, all must dance after and own. 600Pope Gregory barks at the eastern John. Yet wares such pride himselfe a Stately Don Sending to Austin now in Englands Chair A great Archbishops Pall as if there were Archbishop-efficacy in its hems And folds there lapt What right, gray Gregory, stems Thus from thy fatherhood, or Usurpation London to rob of Chiefdom in this nation And give it unto Canterbury thus. This act swells of Supremacy in plush. 607This Pimple grew, and ripend up untill Phocas the murderer set to his Skill. And Universall Headship raisd it to, And such it runs, and all doth overflow Constantinoples bishops swell by arts Too into Universall Patriarchs. But Rome imposes her Decrees on all The Universall Head can't Nod, Erre, Fall. Calls Synods and the Lordship ratify. Doth Monks with Priests and Church Keyes dignify Se that their Ceremonies in all lands Exactly be attended; give Commands And Laws to Bishops Arch; and if they judge Them Obstinate, them to depose they budge. Thus Theodore, Constantinoples Paul The Patriarch expelld the Church, and all. Did prison Gregory of Agregent Bound hand and foot upon his foes complaint. They other Churches rob of Right and Power. To judg, Ordain. Or use the Keyes (Oh tower) The Civill powers command for to set free What Clergy men by laws detained bee. Do Universal Synods authorize By their Decrees: Do croud what they devise Upon all Churches, and their Legates send To Synods, Countries, Kings too to this end. Do marrages forbid to whom they list Base holy dayes erect and send this grist To other Churches and it grind they must Must shave, Grease, Mass sing: all in Latine thrust. They twist at length out of the Emperours hand, His pope Confirming Power. And thus they stand They huff it do, in Silver gold and Gems. John doth John Baptists Church with Silver Stems Arch all about: Donus of Marble makes A fouresquare Porch to Peters for his Sake. Benit, the Virgin Maries doth repare With Ophtick Stones and Porphyry most rare. Rough casts the Walk with Work Vermicular: Both Gold and Silver Vessells on't Confer. A Surplice too of Silke in wrought with gold, To ware when they the Sacred rites tend should. On temples Martin Lavished also Much gold and Silver. Vessells such there stow Unto Vitalian the Emperor Constance extends his bounty very far. A Pall wove ore with gold most rich and brave And many other royall gifts he gave. So to th'Apostle Peter the gospells sent Writ all in Gold, oucht all with Ornament White Gems and of a wond'rous sise did stick About them all about most bravely fit. Honorious who a Monothelite rose In Peters Church in Vatican expose Did gold and Silver: rooft with golden plancks: Of which he Romulus his Pemple flancks By the Permission of Heraclius Peter forgets his fishers Coat now thus. And Sergius to bring the reare up gave A golden Censer Odors sweet to have While Mass is sayd: a Golden Charger trim Stuck with rich Gems all round about its brim. And in its middst a Cross of Jacinth made And of Smaragdine Stone, neatly enlaid, What Pride is here botching the Gospell ore With Silke with Silver, Gold, and Gems in store To gull the World with, as it were a trick To see their Treasures with for bishops thick And not to feed mens Souls nor Sanctify Patience weeps ore this Pride with Shines most high. 4 Patience Excercised under Schisms. The Eggs of Pride thus sat on, out do flur The bub: of Schisms, birds with bill and spur In hawks and Ravens nests hatch, Cocks full keen Do peck out one anothers brains in Spleen. Phocas made Romes so sharp she up doth rise And out doth peck Constantinople's eyes (The Adnates of the Universall Ball) Them Swallows down, and thus Crows over all. Hence sharp Contentions, 'twixt these seats, and jars. They at it tooth and naile. Thus fight the Stars. Heraclius the Emperour did hap Contentions in the East and West to tap. Which tap for two and forty years did run, Before the running of this tap was done. For meeting Athanase the Jacobite At Hierople a full Crafty waite, He would him Bishop make of Antioch If he Chalcedoes faith did hold, then spoke The Crafty Fox, I do profess, saith hee Two natures in one Christ united bee. But pardon me great Sir; how are his Wills And Operations (touching which greate quills Puke ink apace) to be Esteemd, I pray Double or Single? Th'Emperour doth lay The Answer out for Cyrus Phasalis And Sergy of Constantinopoles Who do reply One Will, and Operation In Christ is found. Rome frowns on this Relation Then Cyrus, spite of Rome, that broacht this fray, Is bishop made of Alexandria. But now to damp the fire, they out do fling Two natures joind, one Will, and Works out bring. The Jacobites, and Theodosians leap At this. And say the game is ours, good cheap. For if One Will, and Work, then Nature's one In Christ. Whereat Jerusalem's Sophrone Is startled and rebukes th'Assertion such. Sergy, who liked it, seems at it to grudge. As new, unusuall, willing too to smother Both one and two in Christ, one and the other. Writes to the Roman Pope to put a bar Unto Sophrone, that he no further jar. Sophrone goes on; a Synod calls condemns Monothelites: and Synods Letter sends, To Sergy who doth Cyrus part mentain. And to Pope John, who calls up for the same A Synod and Condemns Monothelites So do the Africans, and Asian Lights. Pyrrhus succeedeth Sergy in his place, And Errour too: and then to Rome did pace Recants his note, doth to Ravenna go, And to't again, then is outchurcht also. Paul him succeeds and's of his Errour heir. Pope Martin therefore doth for him prepare For Cyrus too and Pyrrhus, fivescore ten Insynoded, and doth outchurch these men. Rotharis Lombards King deemd that it made Much to impoverish his nations trade That Pope, and Hexarch, and the Orthodox So well agreed, did issue from his box A Law, that each Church in his Realm mentain, Two bishops. One to preach the Arrian strain, And one the Doctrine Orthodox. And so All the Italian Churches strangly show. When Aquileia's Patrarchy was passt To Grade, the Lombards angry do in hast Ordain one Fortunate an Arrian there Bishop of Aquileia (the King were Consenting there unto) who by strong hand Whips unto Grade, their temple plunders and Whips all to Aquileia. Now the Pope Honorius, offended, Cries a Rope Take Fortunate, and him from's state deposd, And on Primogeny that See's imposd. The Lombards made here at, plunder and stroy At Grade thines Sacred, and prophane. Oh fy! Under Constantine, Heracles, Constance the Emperours. The Brittains Keeping on march fourteeth day Till th'twenti'th first their Easter, make a fray Austin Romes Legate, Englands Reformator Doth disapprove it: and begins to vapor. Romes Easter, and her Ceremonies he Would have by Scotts, and B[r]itains tended bee. The Bishops of the Scots, and Picts, Digame And so Columban did refuse the same. And with these Reformators did deny Communion in food, and Curtesy. They gaind some ireland Scots hereby, yet still The Scots and Picts in Scotland hate this Skill. The English for a while will not thus gad, For Finian, Aidan, Colman, Hilda, Chad And other pious learned persons would Not thus admit them to be had to fold. Till Oswy, at the Synod in Strenshalch Heard Peter who the Keyes of Heaven's vault Taught other wise, he tackt about to Rome Lest Peter keep him out, when he presume At Heavens gate to knock. And now the rest That still opposd, were fain to fly, oppresst. A feud a rose in Spain did them invade. Some onely once, some thrice did dip, its said, In baptism, untill a Councill sit The fourth at Tolet fixt it once to dip. Toleto's Bish, and Sevills quarrell do, For Chiefdom, and to Rome the matters go The Pope takes the Archbishops Seat away From Sevill, and to Tolet it Convay. Schisms under Justinian who began 687 Ravenna's Church, that vy'de with Romes for power And Dignity, till Reparate did shower It in Romes lap. And bishop Theodore Who him succeeded passt it thereto ore. The master Rhanacht taking it full ill Their Bishop Felix also usd his Skill To stir them up to reassume their right Pope Leo stirs Justinian up, whose might Is sent Ravenna to Reduce, and bring To Byzant Felix and the Chiefe with him. He sacks the City, Felix took and sent Thence Captive. And made blinde: And others went Into Captivity: Ravenna bowd Against her will is to Rome Prelate proud. What jars at Rome on choosing Pope we finde When Boniface the fourth his Soul resignd. And Join the fifth: When Conon too did sleep. Whereby this mistress Church in broils did steep. Thus we may se how Patience is abusd While Schisms thus in Churches fat are brewd. Patience Exercised by Persecution. Schisms farewell, and Persecutions next Come in from them, as Doctrines from the text. In Viewing which we quickly come to th'Use They brighten Patience up, so sings my Muse. Under Phocas, who began 604 Phocas that Butcher, boiling in his lust, And Cruelty, his Nobles greatly crusht, Virgins, and Matrons too did vitiate, The Lombards many Christian Crucidate. The Jews at Antioch tumult, destroy By Fire, and Sword the Christians cruelly. Take Bishop Anastase and off they slam His secret members, in his mouth them cram Drag by a Cord ats leg him through the town, Then burnt him in the fire to ashes down. In England Edbald, Edilburt his Son Now King of Kent, from's Father's vertues run Did into Luxury, and's step mam weds, Meeting the Gospell Checks for't lifts his head Against the Godly, Sparkles flash like fire, The Gospell flies his Coasts, Idols aspire And Idol-Worship, things then runing thus The Gospell ministers he down did Crush. Under Heraclius, begining 611. Heraclius rose a Monothelite Wedding his Neece, the Church did sorely bite, Some say his Daughter Epiphania. The Persian 'saile the Empire, Christians slay: Destroy Jerusalem: give to the Jews There ninty thousand persons to abuse. Take Zachary the Patriarch captive And a Vast multitude away alive. The banner of Christs Cross too, and the rage Of King Chosroes flew against all age Of Christians. He all terms of peace doth fly; Unless they'l promise first Christ to deny, And that they worship will the Sun his god. They take one Anastase (to feel his rod. He was a Persian monk) and down him throw Upon his back, and ore his Shins place do A timber log, upon whose Ends do stand Two stout men leaping up and down there fand As in a balance; then they up him high Do by one hand, and at his legs do ty A mighty Stone: and then with seventy more He's hang'd, and's head unto the King they bore. Th'Arabian dogs, and Mahomet destroy The Africk, and Asian Churches nigh. Theodorick doth rage in France, and sent Abbat Columban twice in banishment. He slew his Brother Throdobert the King Of Mets with thirty thousands who hid him Vienna's Bishop Desiderius Exiles, then ston'd to death, but why Sir thus? Because he did reproove him for his Sin. An[d] Dagobert did Churches spoile, like him. In England Wicked Penda, and Cedwald Who slew King Edwin, greatly them up halld. Men, Women, Children too slew Cruelly, In Countrey and in Cities all destroy. Towns, Towers, and Temples burnt, Christians do fall And Idoll Worship up again they hall. Under Constantine/Heracles/Constance beginning 641/641/642 Constantine by his Step dam's poisoned Her Son Heracles lifts up his head Six months, wherein th'Arabians hem in Cesaria Palestine, seven years, and bring Seven thousand Christians to be tortur'd there. Constantinople's Senate too that year Cut out Dam'd Martin's tongue, Heracleo's nose And them exild. And Constance Emperour chose. Who sprang indeed, a keen Monothelite, And did Pope Martine, who this sect did smite In its Chiefe fautors great, with Peters Keyes, Take Captive, Cut his tongue and hand off: payes Him then with Banishment to Thrace, where he By want doth perish, though Romes head he bee. Did Persecute the Bishops, who appear In Africk, in Numedia, and there In Mauritania and did Condemn His Heresy. His fautors play such men. In England Wicked Penda Oswald slew Hence up a further Persecution grew. He raves towards East-Angles. Sig'bert here With mighty pains had gaind his Subjects there Christ to imbrace, comes with them out t'oppose Him. but a mighty slaughter then the foes Do make of Christians, and their King destroy. And now their Churches feel his Cruelty. Under Constantine Pogonate beginning 670 Pogonate with his brethren two arose Who equalld him. Hence he Cut off their nose And Empires it alone, the Churches shine He them did from Monothelites refine. Things ill do jog in France, Lothair their King Lurks in Domestick luxury: doth fling All matters on the Prince in Court Ebroine, A Spunge of Blood, di'de ore with basest Crime. Who under Theodorick next King there Did rule the roast, by whom oppressed were Each vertuous man, afflict the Churches; spoiles The Temples, slays some Doctors, some exiles. Leodigar August Odanum's light He Prisons, Pines, Plucks out his Eyes, doth smite With Wounds upon the sole of's feet; off fley His Lips, and Tongue, then him with sword did slay. Gerinus then he stones to death; and sent Lambert, Amate, and more, to banishment. In England hard things bud: the Scots, and Picts And Britains will not on Romes Easter fix. They out do rush, kill Oswies Son Egfride: And by greate slaughter th'Angli they destroy'd. And now their Churches were in troubles greate. Among the Gevesi, Cedwald, in heate Returnd from Exile, killd their King whose name Was Evildack. And all this Contrey baine, There's not a bishop in't for many years. Then all the Isle of Vecta, wholy clears. Yet lets some noble youths and others, ('cause They know not Christ), before his sword he draws, To cut them down, babtized be, if they Desired the same: as histories do say. Under Justinian 2/Leontius/Absemarus begining 687/697/699. Justinian in the Throne can ne're abide The Roman Prelates Haughtiness, and Pride. Did Cruell grow. Lievetenant Stephen, and One Theodore a monke, under him stand, And Exercise Unheard of Tyranny: Command the Army on a night that they Constantinoples Citizen all slay. Which to Prevent, Leontius Master once Of th'Eastern forces, with the people bounce And a few Captives, rout them: and Captive Justinian; of's tongue, Nose, Eares him shrive Sits in the Throne three years. Then Absimare Doth Empire and his Nose too from his pare. Justinian banis[h]t, treats Prince Cajane's aide. Whom Absimare by Coine his Friend had made. Hence he smelt danger, and to Terbell flies, Lord of Bulgaria, and gets supplies. Constantinople gets, and Captive takes Leontius, Absimare treads on them, spakes This song, Thou'st on the Asp, and Adar tread The Lion and the Dragon trample, read Their fatall Sentence, and they headed are. Seven of the Chiefe, on Wooden Stakes (hard fare) He Spits, and Rosts: and twenty more he drowns: And multitudes by Cruel Deaths Confounds Provides a Fleet their Infants to destroy. Wherein were seventy thousand of his fry Sent by a Storm to pave the Sea's broad floore. Nay, and as oft as he (who'de gaind a Cure) Did wipe his Snotty nose's place, he flew On some, or other, and in vengeance slew. The Lombards Tyrant Alachis, Exiles King Cuniberd; in Christian blood much guiles Threats when he's King, he'l fill his well, and trim, With Clergy's Testicles unto the brim. Whom he asserted, filthy Breeches wore. The Arabs lay Armenia in gore. Ulid their King the Christian Temples burns Now at Damascus, Charges too to turn Their Bookes into Arabian Language, and To write no more in Greek, was his command. The Sclaves, Avares too, the Churches wast And Christians into bondage bring, defac'de The Eastern French do murder Chilian And his brave sociats Tholman, Doloman. Who did the Duke of Herbople with all His Dukedom unto Christ Convert and call. Pipin Commands, or did permit the thing To slay Lampert, who did reproove his Sin. Landobert follows Heimeranus cleare Of Reignsburge in Bavaria, who were By's harlot Sister Charg'd, ore tooke, and splits Him on the Rack, and Cuts him all to bits. In England the Picts getting the day Down go the Churches, Doctors fly away. Evald the White, Evald the Black who, went From England to Saxony, intent To preach Christ there, were martyrde nigh to Breme. The White they quickly slew, the Black a Stream Of tortures did endure. And so they take And Cut him all to bits as authour spake. Now view this thrid, and tell me what you think Is Justice Dead? Doth Patience make her Winke? But what a Patience doth this Stage unfold? Surely it writes her Fame in Liquid Gold. The Shine of Justice. Now Patience take a Nap, we'l onward get And strive to ope Justice's Cabinet For to display her Web all brawder'd ore With wealthy Glory put upon her Score. She soon takes bloody Phocas by the Crown Thundring from God most dismall judgments down. Cosroes breaks his league and over flows All Palestine and Syria, on he roves, Ore Phenice, ore Armenia, and ore The Cappadox, Galace Paphlagone sore And many other places. Europe too By the Avares all ore much doth rue. The Persian war to wonder sweeps down all Except two, di'de in blood of Maurice shall. And fire from heaven, while they did ingage. Fell on them with a mighty shower and rage. A dreadfull famine fights them; doth destroy Both men and beast. The Sea doth frozen ly. Priscus his Son in law 'gainst him Conspires With other Senators burnt by his fires, Write to Heraclius in Africk, who Sent out his Son Heraclius also With force by Sea and land who wins the day The Tyrant takes, His Secrets pares away That many honest Matrons did deflowre Cut off his Hands, and Feet, and gave moreore His body to be burnt in a brass Bull. His Progeny destroy'd they to the full. Thus to be Short Justice doth paint her Hall With Glory when such Varlets blood doth fall. Gifulph the Lombard who the Churches filld With Arians, and Orthodox is stilld Cajan the Avare Prince him routs, destroys Towns, Cities, Ins, and Shops of Blasphemies The Arians had. His Wife Romild defile Fix to a Stump. Men, and Young men Up quoile In death, their Sons and Daughters sell they do. The Jews that torturd, tortures Undergo Theodorick the King of France who's broild In's brothers blood Counsilld by Brumichild. And blood of many other Christians, red, When he his murderd brothers Child would wed, Inflamed by her beauty, he opposd By Brunichid, its incest if they Clos'd, Grew mad, attempts to run her through therefore. But she Escaping of his Sword, him bore A deadly grudge and as Trittenhome told Soon gave him poison, stild with shews like gold. This Brunichild of whom its firmly said Ten King[s] were by her means in Deaths arms laid Beside innumerable vulgar folk, Is taken Captives (now pluck up this stalk,) Warring against Lothair: abhord of all They stoutly on her do with Cudgells fall. Then bring her to Lothair, and then proclaim Her Villanies before the Armie plain, Then ty her by her arms and feet unto A wild mad horse. She's torn in pieces so. Chosroes comes unto his reckonings A six years war in Persia Justice brings. And he his younger Son designd should reign. But Syroes his Eldest in disdain With Souldiers on him rusht, and Captives him, Chaind by his hand and feet, his neck must bring A weight of iron on't, thus pinniond, he Unto the highest Tower Convayd must bee, (Which he had built to hord his Silver in,) There fed with bread, and Water. Oh! Good King! Throwing most Cruell Tawnts out at him thus That of his gold he'st eate, he up did Crush Into that place fisht from the blood of all And havocks of the World, he made to fall. Thus Crow'd the Cockerill over his Sire, And led him out, and made his Eyes ev'n tire To see the horrid slaughter of his Son On whom he purposed his Crown should run. And all his other Children in his Sight He put to death in a most dolefull plight. Then out he set him five dayes all in jears, And orderd him to fall by bows and Spears. Oh Dismall! Justice will so shine that all May stop their mouths. And down before her fall. We Come unto Heraclius, now who Did make Monothelism over flow. He persecutes the Orthodox, forsakes His first up springings: incest wedlock makes Divines by Stars and Birds, and other things. God by his rashness on his Empire brings The Saracens when his Lievetenant falls Upon them and Arabick dogs them calls. Its said Intercate Water him destroyd, And as the Scourge of's incest he's annoy'd His share up turning, all his Urin flew Up in his face unless he back it threw By holding of a board to keep down, to The bottom of his belly when't did flow. Constance another of the same Complection Did also smart feeling his Realms deflection. Fell first into the hands of Saracens Then scaping with his life he meet's amends In Sicily, when one there of his Guard With French Sope had all lavered his beard Did with his razer Cut his very throate Justice will shine with this: oft with a rope. The Executioner under Ebroin Of brave Leodegar makes Justice shine, Against his Will. When him the Divell ceisd And with internall fire scorcht up, diseasd. Ebroin is slain by noble Hermmfride Was seen on Divels backs to hell to ride. Dodo that under Pip in Lampert slew Di'de of the Lowsy Sickness authors shew. His souldiers that did steal the sacred things Of Austrogisil Justice at them flings: Some with their teeth do one another tare Some cut their limbs off. One the fire doth heire. They that slew Project of Avern fare so One breakes his Arm: Worms eat up Radbert doe. In England Eanfride Bernicia's King And Osrick of Northumberland who sing A recantation, and turn back again To save their Lives, and Crowns to Idols vain Are slain by Penda: Penda who defac'd Christ intrest and then Paganry implac'd Is with his mighty army slaughterd by Good Oswy's little host, that looked on high. The farmers that the Evalds off did cut Their Prince did slay, to fire their Village put. The murderers of Chilian, and his mates Justice doth meet with, one falls mad and rates And with his teeth all tares himselfe: another Murders himselfe. Geilane doth all discover Being possesst, and sore tormented by The cursed fiends of hell and horridly. The Duke Theodo of Bavaria Finding him, whom Landobert then did slay As having got his sister's maidenhead, Was innocent, was wroth, Landobert fled Unto the Huns, and Avar's and there dies The Dukedom from his Off[s]pring also flies. He banisht Uta too to Italy, Although his Daughter, who did Whore, and ly. Justinian that would no warning take By all the Strokes that Justice on him makes At last is by Elias ? Murd'red, and then the Throne ? Now Mahomet Son of Abdalla, who A Persian, or an Arabs was, did flow From Emina the Jewess, rose and had A mighty Head, Red face which also fed A long great beard, light heeld, a Crafty pate, First tended Camells for a man of State Then wedding of a Widdow rich became A merchant man and now ups up his name. And Quicly then by a Nestorian Monk Calld Sergius, that came to Mecha, pump Outs Blasphemies against Christs Deity With the Sabellians did the Trinity, And with the Manichees Christ Death revile And did himself the Jews Messia stile, Had taught a Dove to peck out of his eare Its food, which by the people counted were The Holy Ghost, that him inspir'd, when hee Was by the Falling Sickness, causd to bee As in a Transe, and that he then receivd Of the Archangell Gabriel (thus bereav'd Of health,) his law. And then he Captain rose Of Souldiers and in armes he also shows. He said that Angell, in Jerusalem Did Carry him from Earth to heavn, when He learn'd his Mysteries: thence coming down He made Eubogara, Ali Zaid of renown To be his Preachers, who did spread his Game Which in this age flew on the wings of fame. He by the help of Sergius th'Nestorian And John an Antiochian Arian, And two Apostate Jews, did now Compose His Alcoran, which for their bible goes. By Magick Art, and Subtilty bewitcht A multitude, whose ears the Divell twitcht By Witcheries and lies in judgment just To run unto him, having Christ off thrust. Thus on he ran, like to a Snow ball grew, Till justice by her dart him over threw First smitten by a Pleurisy, which had His Old Consort the Epilepsy sad, These Crack his Crown, his Senses say good night. His little finger is Crampt backward quite 632His Cursed Soul out flies. He kept when dead Three dayes to be on the third day up had To Heaven, as he said he should, but no such thing Tending his Corps, his friends away it fling: But Ali took washt, and did cloath the same And bury it. But Mecha had the fame Of having it kept in her Temple, where He by the Eastern parts is worshipt there. This Plague began in Ishmael stock, made way Among th'Arabians, there did not stay, Swept the Saracens soon down: in Mecha hee Left Venu's Worship, and will worshipt bee. In Jesrab his own native place, and in Athrib his Worship quickly up did spring. 617When that the Saracens had Persia won This Artists poison did them over run Yea Syria, Jerusalem, also And all o're Africa this plague did flow Ev'n in this age Who had Christ's name abusd. And Justice judging thus will be Excusd. Now trace this Century, and you shall finde Justice's Glorious Tasles all o're't shin'de. The Glory of Divine Efficiency Divine Efficiency of no mean shine These Darksom Dayes too feeble are to Cover. Whose golden track deserves a pen Divine The same to pollish bright in this thick pother. But now my quill attempts it as I stand With Candle light and Lanthorn in my hand.

Thus on he ran, like to a Snow ball grew, Till justice by her dart him over threw First smitten by a Pleurisy, which had His Old Consort the Epilepsy sad, These Crack his Crown, his Senses say good night. His little finger is Crampt backward quite 632His Cursed Soul out flies. He kept when dead Three dayes to be on the third day up had To Heaven, as he said he should, but no such thing Tending his Corps, his friends away it fling: But All took washt, and did cloath the same And bury it. But Mecha had the fame Of having it kept in her Temple, where He by the Eastern parts is worshipt there. This Plague began in Ishmael stock, made way Among th'Arabians, there did not stay, Swept the Saracens soon down: in Mecha hee Left Venu's Worship, and will worshipt bee. In Jesrab his own native place, and in Athrib his Worship quickly up did spring. 617When that the Saracens had Persia won This A[illeg.]utists poison did them over run Yea Syria, Jerusalem, also And all o're Africa this plague did flow Ev'n in this age Who had Christ's name abusd. And Justice judging thus will be Excusd. Now trace this Century, and you shall finde Justice's Glorious Tasles all o're't shin'de. The Glory of Divine Efficiency Divine Efficiency of no mean shine These Darksom Dayes too feeble are to Cover. Whose golden track deserves a pen Divine The same to pollish bright in this thick pother. But now my quill attempts it as I stand With Candle light and Lanthorn in my hand. In Phoca's time, the whole world feels a blast Of Corn, and Wine but chiefly Italy, A Dreadfull Winter did their Vines so wast, And Rustiness their Fruits, do much annoy.

When Dagobert's small babe, Sigbert by name Baptized was, he spake AMEN out plain. Edwin King of Northumberland did fly To Hedwald the East Angles King to shun Ethelfride seeking him for to destroy. Who now bribd Kedwald to't. Edwin did run Into a Secret place to Save his life When by a friend he understood the knife. Now in a Solitude there to him came An unknow[n] person saying Sir, I know Thy Case, and griefe. What wilt thou give to gain King Hedwald Grace? saith he, I'le all bestow. Then said the man, what if I make thee King Of Greater might than did thy Parents Spring? He answerd as before. What Quoth the man If I thee shew a better way to live Than ere they knew, wilt thou Obedience span. I will said he with all my heart it gave. Then laying's hand on's head, said mind this day When this befalls thee. Then he went away. Soon after Edwin Kedwalds favour meets. Comes to his Kingdom, yet by no means will Be brought to Christ. But Pauline for him Seeks, And in a Vision understands the t'll. Then went and laid his hand on's head and saith Sir knew you this. Yes said he, so came to Faith. That Cruell nation whom for Crueltys Great Alexander shut up all beyond The Caspin Sea, Heraclius implies Against the Hagarens thus going mand An Angell slew fifty two thousand down Which thing is said his life in griefe did drownd. In Constance's, alias Constantines reign. 648A mighty Storm flung Strong trees up by th'roots And many monkish Pillars with them down At fair Constantinople: Earth quakes shooke The Roman Provinces and many a town. A firy Stone like a red lump of steel 650Was seen out from the West, like Draco, wheele. 654It ashes rains: fire out of heaven falls. Constantinople all amazd is found: In Summer a dread plague three months them malls A Spectre's Seen the Parke to circuite round. And on their doores to knock, then soon their drops As many in Death's mouth as he gave knocks. 664When Shaved Crowns, and other Romish things Did Creep in England the Sun did Creep Behinde the moon the nones of May, then Springs Such plagues (while their Religion chast did weep), They fall on latine Masses, Pray to th'Dead, Images, Altars and the like get head. When Wilfride Sussex had Converted, fell A Serene ram, the year itselfe did smile With green Corn fields, where as such want did quell The people here that they in hunger boile And many headlong leap into the main, Three years before having deni'd all rain. Vectarius Captain of the Souldiers brave Of Forojule with Six and twenty lads Brave boyes indeed, the army of the Sclave Assault, and put to flight, away it gads A Divine terrour with Surprizing fear, Fell on them as he in their Sight did peare. In Constantine Pogonate's Reign. 670When Arepert by Grimoald forc'd to fly His Realm, was shipt for England he heard A voice at shoare back to your Country high Within this three dayes Grimoald shall be mard Return he doth, found none at shoar but makes Unto his Countrey, and's realm 'gain takes. 673Ten dayes together fire in heavens shines Some say an Iris, all deem Dooms Day's nigh. 676Pope Deodate dies: and for four month's time Th'Elements seem to breath Rome's Desteny Storms thunders, Lightnings, Men, and beast do rue And all fruits; yet pulse sprung again, ripe grew. 677A Comet like a piller all aflame 678The Heavens Shew, locusts in troops out goe 679Ore Syria Mesopotamia tame One Callicike of Heliople, who Fled: saw in waters fire to burn with which The Romans burnt the Saracen fleet as pitch. 680A mighty Earthquake shakes Mesopotame 682Much Spider-Web from heaven fell that houre 686Wherein they Monothelatism tame. Vasupius did burn, and out did poure Its fires, and Ashes. And all green things 'noy. The Saracens Ceise Africk. Carthage stroy. Plague, famine too pest Syria, Lybia. 687The next yeare blood is rain'd in England. The Sixteenth day of Aprill they say The Moon did seem like blood till Cocks Crow, stand And Constantine the Pogonate you have Soon after this drop down into his grave. In Justinians Reign 690The third yeare of Justinian brought a flood In Venice, and in Italy, they take't Since Noahs never Such: and Ruines scud Ore men and beast, and towns are now enlak't. Paths mard, wayes spoild, Athesis rose so high, Verona's Walls in one part spoild thereby. Rome's Tybur sweld so fast, its waves o're flow Her walls. And in the Chanell of its Stream A Monstrous Dragon with greate Store also Of Serpents through Rome to the Sea did team. A Dreadfull Plague did hereupon ensue That Scarce a few live, of an Endless Crew. In Leontius his Reign Constantinople feels a Deadly plague, In France a man whose Eyes Ebroin out dug Retird to pray on Soen's banke, and heard made A noise of Rowers up the Stream to tug. Whom he Zohow'd: and they replied, that they Should fetch Ebroin to Vulcans Pot, t'have's pay. 700Bread Corn, and Barly, and much Pulse did fall Like to a Shower of Rain out of the Clouds. About this time, full wonderfull to all Within Campania, now hunger Crouds No more as yet. Cornfields and threshing floors Are in the Clouds, whose Crop our markets plores. And now behold Divine Efficiency In Glory flash throughout this age most bright In things that hap not ordinarily, Granting the inck of truth to Pens that write. Whose flourisht Arms there on our Sign Post raise To shew her sparkling dress to bring her praise. The Glory of Divine Truth. But where is Truth? Can she with Falshood shine Sure she is Shuffled out of Doore. But se her Glory all Divine. The Holy leaves read ore. The Clayey-Iron toes with all their joynts The Beast's feet have: though yet weake naild, Now through the Skin the small horn points Though with hair vaild. A Star from Heaven falls to Earth and brings The Key of Hells pit bottomless. Unlocks the doore and out it flings All Smoakiness. Gregory the Greate did finde a nest of Keyes In Peters Trunck: or Coffin'd Shell. Tokens for Kings: Sir, if you please, These unlock Hell. The Roman Star drops from the Heav'nly Orb Unto this Carnall Earthy State. Sits in Gods Temple is made Lord, Ore Stars and Fate. The Woman must receive the dragons Throne. And ride the Beast of Scarlet die. Justinian's block, Romes Bishop shown O're others fly[.] The Head upon this Horse block got to get A Cockhorse strove, ? Blockhead did. The Blocks too low. Pelagius a new Step Sets on its Lid And having tam'd the Beast, he up did jump To get upon her back to ride. Could not his leg get ore her rump Squokd down. Poore guide. But now by this time she well trappled 'bides And Phocas heaving at the brich Of Boniface the third, who strides Her by his hitch. The Beast though backt's not broke, be Chary And if you Whip, or Spur, she Kicks. If Curb, she pawn, Maddam be wary, Lest she shew tricks. The Harlot rides at first full Gingerly. She goes a jogging trot, and paws The Saints in sev'rall Realms down nigh A Sword out draws. Brisk Martin on her back did twitch her rains Girt, Crupper, Curb her up, her Spurs. She Pawns, Kicks, Casts him, knocks out's brains How Cheere you Sir[?] She slunk this Colt. But still the Harlot toles Her to her hand, rides on her jogging. Kings are, and Queens her Filly foals And little Dobbins. And as she rides her golden Cup she holds Still in her hand and puts therein Of her Abominations bold. All bubbs of Sin. Sabinians grape did drop this juyce into't. That Lamps in Churches ever flame. And Bells must ring a Call. (which fruite Deserves no blame) Phocas and Boniface the third do Squeeze Their brains whose juyce then in't that drops Is Universall Headship: flees Ore all Christs flocks. A Councill of 100 their Decree Do drop herein to ratify This Headship ore all Churches se This Liquour, fly. Then Boniface the fourth, with Phocas grace, Presst the Pantheon temple till It drops All Saints in to't apace Oh! happy still. He put in't Altar Cloaths and Nectar made Of Sacerdoted Monks well fed. And Theodate his Law, that said No God child wed. Honorius puts in'to't the Holy day Of th'Exaltation of the Cross Eugenius Prisons out doth lay And such like dross. Vitalian threw therein the Organs first. And Latine Tongue for Worship all. The Kissing Pax from Leo burst. His Drops that fall. Sergius Put in't an Agnus Dei Song For to be sung at Sacr[e]d Mass. And others let their Crabs to run Into this Glass. And thus abominable things do bleed Into her Cup which all must drinck Both Kings, and Queens in very deed Although it Stinck But lest her heads too heavy be to get Without th'Impeariall Hand to guide Them on the Body and to set Them up to ride Constantine Pogonate the Stirup made'm Yet longer that they mount up may Without Imperiall Confirmatum And ride full Gay. These things the Scripture shewd them done we shew And herein se how Truth doth shine. In all such Villanies we view A Straiter line. Thus Having Passt this Century through we See These various Attributes do mix Their Glory shining through't that we On God may fix. Wherefore I passing from it, heave my Pen Its Golden threshold o're to write What Shines the next do make me ken And lay in light Entring the maine of this Eight Century My Cars I first in Asia do try And thence unto the rest in order come Seeking to flowrish o're my Sailes that hum Before the Aire, with those imbellishments Which from the glorious Sparkling Radient Vents Of Grace, of Patience, Justice, do arise Efficiency, and Truth, in Glorious wise. Asia. In Asia's Sound I first my Plummet Cast And fathom there Jerusalem where rose One Theodore, an image monger vast: Elias, John. At Ascalon there grows Demyse, at Majame Cosmas open shows. At Antioch fifty years vacancy Is quite remov'd by Jealous Stephen, whom The Mahomet doth grant them, as Supply Pious Theophylact him after comes. Two other then whose Errours doth ?num[.] At Epiphania in Syria Brave Cosmas Shines who Images defide At Laodicea John did display The Gospell Flag. Then Gilfred it did guide Then Anastase whom Mahomets annoyde. At Antioch that of Pisidia Gregory who did images Condemn Though after did recant, did bishop play. Then Basil Tricacab that damned them: And was exchurch'd by imagemonger men. At Ephesas brave Theodose down throws Church images, and did this fact defend. At Pergamus Pastillas them oppose Did, and Inger at Nice did Gainst them bend. Them John of Nicomedia condemnd. One Gregory Neocesarian And at Nacolia One Constantine Hold forth the Gospell light and play the man Strike Imageworship down, yet did decline Thereto: yet Constantine recants his Crime. African Lights. Poore Africa how lean art thou, wee finde Two onely at thy Alexandria nam'de. Cosmas who from Monothelites did winde Fell into Image worship and is maim'd. Politian's the other, meanly fam'de. I fetch a Sigh over the Mid-Sea iles Finding no torches there but such as are Set up to Images, which wasts my Stiles Ore into Europe, and do take her aire, In Phoce, and Macedonia all bare[.] European Lights. Alas poore Thrace! Constantinople, thou Hast Emperours, that Image worship hate But all thy Bishops, at the Gospell, plow, Some few excepted, pleaded for the State Of such Strange things, as things all venerate. Yet John retracts his Monothelitism. And calls a Synod: Images Condemns And Anastase Condemneth Imagism Though bad in other things. Then out there stems Nicetas brake from Churches walls such gems[.] Nicephorus rose its said a pious and An Expert man, but little told wherein. Though many other in this Church did stand They rose up Image Mongers and did sing Their vile tantarraes to the man of Sin. Farewell Poore Thrace and Macedonia. I must hip over famous Grece also. In Italy I come, but make no Stay Till at Millan I Benit find although The Pope abusd him, of renown to grow. In Aquileia Peter pious Shone: Serene Christs ready Servant after him. Paulinus afterwards a man well known For Scripture truth: but yet is very dim For prayres to Saints his other Lustre grim. Passing to France I finde true shines most rare At Lyons Euchery, then Addo rose. Serenus at Marselleis shows more fare Than many other. Scripture light out flows From him: hence Images he over throws[.] Erkenbode bishop at Marine tooke pains The Gospell Doctrine well to propogate. Clement, and Samsons Scots, Sydony gain With Virgil Gospell Weapons and debate The Cause of Christ against Rome filthy State[.] Albertus Gallus a brave pious man With them the gantlet takes against Romes Cheats Unmaridness, Saints, Reliques Sovereign Headship and Purgatory, and like feats Wherefore in Fulda jayle he rots. Sad Seates! John of Mailros a learned Scot did rise And founds Ticinum Called at Command Of Charleman. Claud Clement learned wise A Scotch man with him came to Paris and Founds Paris Collidge by his learned hand. Elaccus Albine an English man who had With th'other two before, his Tutor Bede Expert in Latine, Greek, and Hebrew, clad With Scripture Shine did Fathers ancient plead: When he in France did them with learning lead. Egila Bishop was in Spain: who sent Unto the Pope for light in many things. Whose answer when he read, did not Content His opposition thereunto he brings. They are not Scripturall. The Pope hence flings. In Germany I come where t'other day The Gospell had but small impression made Its streames there flow, though greatly muddy stay At Havare, Thuringe, Hassia, are displaid They Saxony, Frizers, Halsace invade. Greate Charles observing how the Saxons play Both fast, and loose brought by Albine's advice Ten thousand with their Wives and babes away From Albis bancks to Flanders in a trice To dwell with Christians, so to teach them Christ. The Choicest Lights of purest shine we see Display the Gospell here were such as these Sidonius at Laureace worthy hee Then Virgil Solivague an Irish frieze A worthy Learned man with truth them fees. Ariovolephon of Choice Esteem In Bavar but exchurcht by Boniface, Dortein, and Berter, Camberth, Unrade seem With Anobert, to be men of rich grace In that the Pope with's trash did them displace. Willibrord Clement born in England went Unto the Frisers, and the Gospell spread All ore the Western Shore, at Traject Spent His dying breath, and left his flock, thus fled. Andhane the gospell there preacht Living bread[.] Lebwin an English man with many more There preacht. And in Wesphaly Christ displai'd. Witho a Frisian born was bishop ore The Church at Osnabargh, provision made To feed Christs Lambs which at his hands had aide. To England now I come, In Kent up sprang Britwald, Thetwin, Nothelm, and Cutbert too And Athelard, whose Works had some strong tang At York was Beverlacy who up grew Bedes Tutor, of a Gospell gracious hew. Then Egbert, King Eadberts brother, shone Then Albert Clean, then Eanbald ruld there. At 'Farn was Egbert Kimber, Candid known Acco at Hagulstad stain'd with Romes geer At Rochester Coctus Thebert did peare[.] Forther Durotrigue Sherburns bishop was. Hedda, and Daniel, Hunfrit bishops were Of Gospell Shine at Worcester I pass All other ore, but Scotland come not here Hist'ry forgot thee much too much I feare. Now many Learned Monks and Abbats shine. John Damascen in Asha though unsound, Cosmas another. And in Egypts Chine One Thomas who stood on no better ground, In France rose Carolomain, a thing strang found. Paulus Diaconus a learned man But is Corrupt in Principles out came. Benit (the Benedictines from him Sprang,) First brought Glass pictur'd windows there: his name Is greate, was Tutor unto Bede of Fame[.] Iglace of Farn did give out learnd Choice Rayes. Plegwin did do the Same, these Souls delight. Ethewolfe did so too. But Bede did blaze At Gerwick born, when seven years on him light Is left at Wire with Benit him t'inlight[.] From whom he having suckd his rudiments Archbishop Beverlacy Pupills him And Abbat Ceolfride. The learned tents Of Latine, Greek, and Hebrew he walkd in, Of Arts, Philosophers, and Poets trim. Comes to the Court of Rich Divinity Doth with his plumit ancient father sound, Councills, and Histories, to fathom try The Sacred Scriptures where all truth profound In Wreaths of Gracious Colours doth abound. His nineteenth year did him a Deacon make And thirti'th year a Priest: and he attends The Office of a Doctor for Christs sake In Wire, and Girwick Abby and there spends Among his Pupills, while his Life Exttends. Was Modest, Chast, and Pious, entring on His Lucubrations with his suites in prayer. Imbibes into his Pupills many an one Philosophy and Physicks and makes bare The Mathamaticks, till they learned are. In sermons did the Holy texts Expound With sayings of the Fathers them enlac'd. In Allegories did delight to sound. Turnd Psalms, Johns Gospell, other books imbrac'd, Into his Native tongue, before all grac'd. Egbert of Farn remiss in office Charge He Chides full sharply, did advice bestow To make the Saxon Tongue the Scripture barge And it translate into that tongue, that so The reading Saxons might the Scriptures know. He by his learned pen did on it write From Genesis to Revelations last Did Six and thirty volumns pen which plight Up seventy eight books do. And still are Cast Into eight Tomes which in our hands are Vast. But by his Dayly pains, and Fasts he fell A vomiting, and so a Catarrh sprang. Yet he his dayly Studies, tended well. Lections, Psalms, Problems too on him did hang Which he performd when this Disease began. When Easter nigh approacht, this him did Seise. Now he Johns Gospell hard speake English made Unto his Scholars thus his minde would ease. My Children learn while I am with you staid. For know I do how long I'st be delaid. Although my Maker soon doth take me hence And Spirit go to him that it me sent So long as life I have, my God dispense Did me good Consill all my life, now spent I wish for Death to be with Christ in's tent. To men Securge he urgd, It dreadfull is To fall in th'hands of God Omnipotent. And in his sorrows, Comfort suckt from this, God Chastens e'ry Child he hath, and sent Gold in the fire, for its approbatment. He oft repeated Ambrose's dying Speech I'v not so liv'd, that makes me blush to live Nor fear to die: for we've a Good God, each. And pray'd, thus, Lord accept thy Servant. Give. Thou not the proud to sclander me, whence drive Three weeke before Ascention day his aile Began to be more violent, yet hee That and next day did not to dictate fail Then calld the Ministers, who wept to se And gave them gifts, and Comforts them full free. Its time, saith he, If so my maker please That now I from my flesh may to him goe. Who, when I was not, me of naught did raise. I long have livd, he well provided so For me. My dying Day full nigh doth grow. Indeed, my Soule doth much desire and Crave To see Christ my King in's glorious Magesty. And on th'Ascention day prayd thus to have. O King of Glory, Lord of Vertues high Who this day wentst above all Heavenly Sky Leave us not father less, but on us send The Fathers Promise, th'Spirit here of Truth. Which being spoke his last gasp did attend. All noses filld with Odors (story shewth) 734 Which with a Vernall joy brake out like youth. Sigwolfe a minister of Christ up grew Too in Northumberland most Studious In holy Scripture, Albines Friend full true. And Cutbert who at Wire with all that host Was famous, Wrot Bede's Life, and's works sav'd most. These and such men like flaming Candles stand Shining in Graces Dorman Windows bright. But not so bright but spots and popish brand Are very many ery were in Sight On most of them, and others. Hence we sigh. The shine of Patience By how much Graces Candle now grows dim By so much more doth Patience shining spring. Whose beaming Rayes I come again to take As Lanthorn Lights, up in my hand to make A light to shew the way God walks in through This Century while hellish Imps do brew All Hellish Liquour, in the Mash fats wrought Of Pride, Contentions, Errours, Tortures, naught That by this Light we may Gods glory Eye ? the Darkness that doth cloud the Sky. Pride Onely by Pride's Contention: in whose Clink Doth ly a Wisp, and Sand, though black as inck, That brightens Patience till her plate out shine The glorious body of the Sun in prime Pope Sergius playing whoremaster begot A bastard [incomplete line] The mark thus of the whore of Babylon Was now his brand. The Clergy hereupon Would kick this Spotted Leopard quite away: And Leo Chose. But Sergius kept the play. 702John Sextus follows him, whose pride up towers To get Ravenna's Hexarchate in's power. But being Slain the Popedom rowles into 704John Septim's lap, whose Pride did overflow Swelling to finde the Eastern Churches would Not to his headship bow nor Stirrup hold. He for them gapes, as for a gudgion, and Wrote to the Wreath to bring them to his hand. Adorns in Stately Shew Churches, Churchyards With Pictures, Images, and such like guards. 706Then twenty dayes Sisinny hufft in pride Then he by Vine, Venus or Venom dide. 707Constantine next, who to Byzantium went, And thence to Nicomedia the tent Where now the Emp'ror was who at his feet Falls prostrat seing how the Pope did Sweep The ground with his Pontificalibus Did beg a pardon of his Sins, and thus Crav'd of him Sacred Mass, some thinke also Hence Sprung the Kissing of the Popes greate toe. And in this pride returns with gift all Stoughd. Swells o're Ravenna till it's over throughd. Claims Ticine Church as his, and therefor sets It free from homage unto Millain's Skirts. But these are butterflies: he higher soares For when Philippicus the Emp'ror doors Did shut upon the Roman Prelates pride And Pictures of the Saints in temples 'stroy'de Constantinoples sixt great Synod, which For image worship voted, down did pitch Cast down the Images wherein were drawn The Acts thereof. And his own Faith, no spawn Of forgeries, drew up, and sent this pope Commanding him his Superscription to't, And all the Roman Clergie's, he did Swell Untill his gall did grow, as black as hell. Commands that none say Mass for him, or have Within the Church his Statue set (bold knave) The Name of Emperour Hereticall By publick or by privat writings shall In Lead, in Brass, or Silver none accept. Chargd Britwald Englands Primat up to get 710A Synod images to ratify At London, and by his authority He should commend them both unto their Kings And to the People; and this Prelats wings Made two East Angle King, one Coen red And Offa when at Rome shake from each head His Royall Crown, and ware a Monkish Cowl. When such Pride blossom Patience sure doth howle. 714But Pride must fall. Greg'ry the second rose And all in pride most furiously he froaths. Doth Gorgeous make his Temples, Altars and Monasteries made Purgd the Chappell stand Calld the Jerusalems. And beautifide The Oratore in th'Patriarchate wide, With Metalls to Saint Peters honour, bright And dawbd the Walls about the Altar quite With Silver o're, and the Images he made Of th'twelve Apostles, nine score pounds out layde. But these are Shrimps: his pride much higher grew He Damn'd, and Excommunications threw On Leo the Emperour, and Anastase The Patriarch, because they 'way did chase All Image worship. And Commanded all Hespery, and Lugury off to fall With Italy, and ev'ry Western Realme From their Obedience to him at the helme. And not to give their Cesar tributage And League'de with France against him was to wage Raisd arms Italians and Longobards Gainst Eutichy Lievtenant of the Wards Of the Imperiall Host, sent Boniface His Legate proud in Germain to desgrace Those Churches there with popish trumperies And marks them with his mark, idolatries. 731Greg'ry the third then strides the beast, and he As arch as was the former needs must bee Against the Long'bard who hard arms up took For's Seat against the Wreath, he calls the Duke Of Venice: and the Hexarch hints to him. And calls unto the Same Charles Frances King. He by the Long'bard chast from Italy The Greeks: and them did by the French annoy. Leo the Emperour, and Anastase Constantinoples Bishop did disgrace Damn'd, Excommunicated, and with drew The west from Faith, Obedience, tribute due Unto the Emperour, and did translate The Roman Church's safeguard from the Gate Of Eastern Emperours to Kings of France Who did unto his popish fiddle dance, Over the Church of Christ a Lordship swayes Its Head he will be calld: His Legates raise That all obey them he commands, as just: But yet proud Lucifer soon drops to dust. 743Next Zacharia's Pride falls to Ferment, The Popedom being his doth give it vent. He first invented Sacerdotall Vests With gold and Gems distinguisht from the rest. He made a golden Vest, and Silver Crown, For Peters Altar sacred of renown. Claims Power Divine t'impose and to depose Kings, first, that froward grow, as storie goes. And to absolve their Subjects from their Oath Of true Fidelity (What fruit hence growth?) Charles Martills Bastard, little Pipin, who Betray'd his Lord, he Crown'd King up did throw Childericks Kingdom on him and his Heirs, Tho him no aide against the Long'bards Spares. Kings he did Stigmatiz with's beastly Brand: 746Made Car'leman a Shavling Monke to Stand And Rachis too the Long'bard King also 749With Wife, and Children into Cloisters goe. Theodorick too King of France there thrusts. As Boniface desir'd who hath the trust 750To do the feate and to annoint in's stead Pipin the King of France, and Crown his head. The French, and German Churches did disguise And did them tread by Romes Idolatries. Vile Boniface Archbishop made of Ments And Colen Church he brought into his tents Churches and Bishops, and the French Kings hee Orders him to Secure and to him see. And thus we finde how Pride his topsails blows While Patience weeps. But down he tumbled goes. Its said, he to Ravenna going had A Cloud all day from heat him shadowed. And did by night his Camp Surround. And led With fiery troops next day that ore him fled. 751Next Stephene Second Cockhorst it whose Spurs Are Steeld with Pride, his works are mostly blurs. Romes Primacy he mounts up: up doth tower Of making, and unmaking Kings his power. The Kingdoms of the World, and Glory brave Right or not right Rome's Seat he judgd should crave. Ravenna's Exarcate he wriths away From th'Longbard by King Pipin, and his fray. And other Countries too of Italy That stretcht out to the lake of Venice ly, That to the Eastern Emperour belong And by the Title (be it wicked wrong) Of Peters Gift or Patrimony to The Seat of Rome he them made subject go And for requitall unto Pipin King And Charles and Charlamain, he did them bring To Peters and Paula Altar, them annoints 752Kings, and right Heirs of Frances Realm appoints And thunders out his Curses on the pate Of such as this decree should violate. When Chilperick the rightfull king peeps out From's Cloister, he in thrusts him back and snouts. And Pipin and the French unoathed from The Cath that bound them to their now poor Don. From Rachis he, and Longbards safe did bring One Desidery and declar'd him King. Against the Grecians Empire he in hate Consults it from them to the French t'translate. To ty the French in faster knots, by flies He Pipin moove (and here's the Rat he tries) To Choose him Godfather unto his Son: That So his Power might o're them ruling run. When Pipin and his Son Charles on the ground Once sat, they kist his Feet: and up skipt Round And held his Stirrup, and his horses Rains. While up he rose, brave Orslers he gains. He was the fire brand, and the trumpit blew Of war, that Pipin and Longbards brew, At Ticine, where fell Aistulph: at whose fall He with his popit Gods, Saint-Relicks all In Solemn pomp, and triumph first began Rode on mens Shoulders to the Lateran. Hence sprung the Pride of Popes wherein they ride Upon mens back: Yet down Death through his Pride. 757Him Paul the first succeeds: Prides Spawn cast in The Popedoms Pride pleck soon Sprung up in him. The Church of Rome he in his letters Calls The Spirituall Mother of the Churches all. That Popes as worldly princes lord it might He deemd, and Kingdoms, and their glory bright Might have and hold. And Lawfull Kings dispise. The State of th'Roman Empire makes his prize Ravenna's Exarchate, and all the Land Of Italy left lapt up by the hand Of Stephen, in th'Pall Peters Patrimony, With all his might and Rhetorick like honey Against the Greeks and Longobard, who were The rightfull Lord of all those realms plac'd Here. The Beneventines, who possessions got In Company, and had unto the lot Of Sicily Patrician subject been He threatend more than once with languague keen, He'd be upon their backs unless they do Desist their Enterprises, to their woe. Pipin his godfather wrote and exhorts The Roman Senate, and folk of all Sorts That they stand firm, and faithfull under call, To Peter Prince of the Apostles all. And to the Holy Church of God, and round Their Spirituall Father who's most blessed found And Coangelicall by God held ope Lord Paul, Chiefe Priest, and Universall Pope. Yet of a fever in Pauls Church he fell 767Like to a Fatted Swine. Thus Pride farewell. Then Constantine a hurly burly gang Crowded in Peters Chair, not worst of bran. Swells with th'Imperiall Poison of his Seat After the Worlds Grandure, and Glory greate. Saluteth Pipin, and intreats his aide, And shews he nothing dreaming thus, was made By boist'rous hands the Churches head and found That men malivolent did much abound. And these seditious Superstitious ones Surprize him soon, and bring him to his groans. Him on a woman Stoole did set in Scorn, Choose Stephen Pope, and Strip him, thus forlorn, Of his Pontifick robes, and his Defence And acts, (and him too so we assert) go hence Into the bur[n]ing fire, because they deem Him Leo and the Long'bard's friende did seem. In all this huff ining and outing sure Patience is Exercised and shineth more. Now Waldipert, and's faction in did slide 768Philip, whom Gratios, and his, turnde aside. And Stephen Tersh did now the Saddle stride, Whose beauty turnd Pope Zachary aside: (Warming his Sacred Chastity, untill In th'Chamber of the Lateran Patr'arch, skill Broke from his points, as fat as Sodoms trade. Where he had Paul, and Sephen's Stallions made) He to the throne ascends in blood, all dide Church Minister but wares a Sword by's Side. He playes the Smooth boots to the Kings of France But boldly doth Condemn their Pipes and dance Of Wedding with the Long'bards lest these tunes Should them inchant to pluck the Popedoms Plumes He Gloria in Excelsis institutes On ev'ry Sabbath day be sung by mutes Which are his Seven Weekly Cardinalls Millain by's force now to the Popedom falls. By bloody Arms did Bishop Michael kick Out of Ravenna's Sacred Bishoprick. Did Desiderius stripe by Pipin's hands And made him to blesst Peter give his Lands. Sedition mov'd, wagd war in pride untill His plumes arrested fall under Death Bill. 772Next Adrian did on the jades back jump. The Clarks, and Flock his leg lift ore her rump. Thus in the Saddle set doth ride, all finde, Not with a Priest like, but a Princes Minde. Salutes the Emperour and Emperess. Did Charles with Letters fourty four address By Power Clavicular he u'sd to bring Kings and their Kingdoms truckling under him. Thassilomus Duke of Bavaria Would anathematize, if he delay Obedience to Charles, the King of France He Crusht the Long'bards by the gallick lance. Bartha the Widdow too of Charlomain, With Desidery King of Long'bards ta'en, 773With Kingdom, Wife, and Children, gave did he To Charles unto perpetuall Slaverie. Unto this Charles he did translate in spite Constantinople's Emperors own right. Two Sons of Charles the Great annoints Kings, soon, 787And also them Patricians made of Rome. Made Charles the Greate Confirm by oath the Gift His Father Pipin on the Church did lift. Made Long'bards Spoletoes Reatines too Crouch down to him. Made Hildeprand also Duke of Spoleto. In the Churches he Doth make things Splendid, Gold and Silver bee. He overlaid Pauls Altar all with gold. And made his Image of rich gold (its told) Cups, Platters Vests and such like things he made Of Silver, Gold, Gems, and Rich Stones inlaid. But all his Pride and Cruelty's a blast. Its quickly tumbld down to dust at last. 796Next Leo Ters is mounted, whom they have As any of them all as arch a knave. He did Confirm Adulterated blood (That from a piece of Crucified wood Impostors did asser[t] did flow, to fix Their Image worship by such jugling tricks When calld to answer for the same) to bee The very Blood of Christ (Blasphemous hee) By his Authority, and bulls: and states A Yearly holy day for't Consecrates At Mantua its still ador'd: some say, And plenty of it there reserv'd did stay. Aloft he rides over the Church in pride By no man to be judgd, yet's pleasd to ride If possible, free from his Crime broacht forth By purging of his headship by an Oath His Headship constituteth Aquisgrane Upon King Charles his Suite (Oh subtil brain) The Royall Seate, and Head of France beyond The Craggy, Alpine mountains up to stand. His Lordship sitting on his Cushon spide The Roman Senate treat to lay aside That yoak so burdensom, that did them check Of Grecian Emperors upon their neck. His jeolous head began to beate lest hee Should by this Project, ore projected bee, Unto his griefe. His nimble brains do ring To Subject Rome to th'Roman Pope, as King And him a mighty bulwark to advance By that most valient Arm, the King of France. So France by him's made Emperor. (a Rope!) And the Chief power imperiall's in the Pope. This pritty Knack trips up the Emprour's heels And picks the Senats brains out. Hence he wheels His Legats unto Charles with Sacred Keyes The Emblem of his Pontificiall pleaes. And offers th'Banner of Rome's City, or 796The Eagle the Imperiall Sign and fur. Himself and Rome unto his Faith Comends. And orders him his messengers to send That by the Sacrament Confirm they might The Romans to their Faith, and 'bedience right. The Senat saw not this. He quickly slips From Rome, with Senators two hundred, trips To Charles at Bodabrune; they him invite To Rome informing of him wrong or right. The Worlds Head shall not quiet bee unless Charles, Consull of th'Eternall City, dress, And its perpetuall Tribun, do set free Her from the Sorrows she is like to see. For in a Woman there no Safeguard lies, Which doth th'affairs of men thus enterprize To Rome Charles highes at Peters Altar's set Upon his Head the Crown Cesarean get And deck him with Imperiall Robes he doth: And him annoint with oyle so much it flow'th Trickling From head to foot. The people shout Let Life and Victory flow round about To Charles Augustus made by God (they tune) Him Great Pacifick Emperour of Rome. Thus he translate the Empire did to France: But kept its power himselfe, to make them dance. But Adrians Kin, and Primicery and Campule the Priests made Leo understand When he was Celebrating Letonie Walking without the walls on horse back by Pancretia's Chappell with his Baal Crew, For there they take him, off from's horse him threw And strapt his sides: and thrust him also do Into Erasmus Abby: thence let goe He by Albine his Chamberlain ore th'Wall, Was, and did high to Charles and shews him all. Who honours him, and sent him home, he here Did in a Synod by his Oath him cleare. The Cause he was thus jearkt, is judgd to bee, Because, the City, Senate, Empire he Devised thus to overthrow by Charles. Whereby he them in thralldom thus ensnarles. And all this while Prides blossome in him do To Patience's griefe, in florid Colours grow. But soon his Straps do breake, his blossoms fall. His pride kicks up its heells. And Death stains all. Thus by these instances you easly finde How Prelates ruffling sleeve stand huff'd with winde Of Pride, and Haughtiness which struts their Eyes To look o're Kings, and Princes Heads though wise. And thrusts their Heads above the Stars, although They dirty are as if they usd to go Not on their feet, but on their Heads in mire And so they do in that they this aspire. But all the while March Wind on Patience blows His nipping cold whitening her Web halfe froze. Contentions. Pride leads the Van, and to the March doth drum, Contentions take th'alarm and on do come. Phillippicus a prudent man's head achs, He dreams the Eagle it a Cover makes. A monke interprets it, the Empire shall (Whose Ensign is the Eagle) to him fall. Then Absimare him takes, did scourge, and Shave And him in iron Chains Exile, poore knave[.] 706Justinian to his throne returns again. Claws Absimare, Leonore, Heraclius then And direfully afflicts his Enemies, Plucks out the Patriarch Callinichu's Eyes Doth banish him to Rome. And the other sent To Reconcile the Churches which dissent Two Bishops with his faith fair pend out to Pope John the Seventh whom he crav'd also To call a Synod and approve the Same This should damp out the West, and Eastern flame. The Proud pope huffs, what nosed be must hee? I scorn your words. Ile not soe novic'de bee. The legat, and the Libells back he sends. Poore Emperour go bite thy fingers ends. Soon after Constantine the Mitre wares. The Emperor him invite[s], hence he repares Unto him in his glory 'fore whose feet The Emperour falls prostrate him to greet Begs pardon of his Sins. Confirms also The Priviledges of Romes Church that flow. Felix Ravenna's Bishop also snarles Against Romes Lordship nothing yield by parls. Justinian Swops his Side. Ravenna Crouch Is made against his Will to th'Roman Pouch. Sisinny and Diascorus in Ruffs Do for the Popedom fallen fall to Cuffs Dioscorus poore man is Soundly soucde Sisinny wins the day, yet soons unhousd. Dioscorus then, hardy Sir, again Fell s[c]uffling for't, and now it doth obtain. Then Boniface did wring him by the eare And boxt him soundly, drove from the Chair[.] The Eagles Egge she laid within the nest Built on Phillippicus his Pate undrest 713Now hatcht indeed: He Emperor is made. Constantinoples Image Synod paid. Pluckt down the Picture in the Church wall, which Containd the Acts whereon these Sirs did Pitch. Cast Cyrus out of his Paternall Chaire. And made John Monke to be its worthy heir. Pope Constantine began to brissle then. In Synod John and Philipick doth hem About with his Anathemaes, untill Lievetenant Peter by defensive skill Endeavourd to defend th'Imperiall right Against the Pope, much blood did fall in fight. 715When Theodosius filld th'Imperiall Throne, Millan and Ticine Churches proude now grown, Ticine will not to Millan subject bee. The Pope then Claims her his. Good pope you see[.] 718Leo Isaurus gains th'Imperiall Wreath Seing Mahometans blasphemies breath Cut much against the Christians, who adore Did Images and Dead mens bones, grew sore A Synod calls, the Matter treats, Condemns All Image worship. Relicks Deadmens Stems. And Statues made of Silver, Gold, and Wood, He purgd away by fire: made Statutes good Against the Same: admonisheth the Pope To do the Same. Pope German then sets ope His hellish mouth asserting Antichrist Shall Images destroy, Christians up hoist To whom his Ecumenicall Caball Subscribe their Itaes: Gregory's rich Pall Entreates th'Emperiall favour t'lend his Smile Upon these pretty things: but frowns yet Spoile Them, wherefore he in Synod doth the Wreath His Excommunication it bequeath And doth absolve Rome, Italy, and th'West From all Obedience to him, and his Chest Shall not Contain any more tole or Rates: 723Seing he Images thus antiquates And Covenants with French him to defend Against th'Imperiall Lion not his friend. John Damascen a Champion rose, well mand With Eastern bishops: and the Emperour damnd Because these pritty knick knacks he destroi'd: And Image Worship would not let abide, Amator Bishop too, of Forojule, Is drove from home by Calist who did rule The Aquileian Church. Duke Pemno, and The Long'bard Nobles could not beare this hand: But Calist take, in Potius Castle Cast. Then Luitprand did Pemno treats at last. Ceol fride the Abbat by his wile, and ly, That the Apostles Order all men eye, Out of the Gospell, where he Enter layes Upon the first Lords day, the third week payes That all true Catholicks, ought to be put: Into a Shav'de Crown of Saint Peters Cut. Whereas the Brittains did the fashon ware Of Simon Magus in their Poled hair. Brought Naiton King over the Picts, unto The Roman Ceremonies. Dumchad who 728Was Abbot, brought his Monks Rome marke to bare But still the Brittains do dispise this fare. 741Copronymus, who tawe the Font when hee Baptized were, Shines with imperiall glee Now Winofrid an English man, who drew At Cridon Devonshiers, his first breath, grew Unto great fame, was Legate Boniface Under three Popes or more and had the Place Of Men t'his Bishoprick, With Colen jars For the Trajectine Church and upstarts wars. Mannagd by Tongue, and Teeth, Colen thus Cries King Dag'bert gave it me. Th'other replies, It was to propagate the Gospell to The Frisers which not done, you lost it so. And Willibrord sent by the Pope did soon Build its Church ruind up, hence't fell to Rome. The matter's brought to th'Pope who gave the Case And Colen Church also to Boniface[.] An Unlearnd Priest now in Bavaria found He in babtizing, thus his tongue did sound In Nomine Patria, and Filia Et Spiritus Sancta did begin afray. For Boniface would have them thus babtizd Be rebaptizd, this trick of his devisd, Sidony, and brave Virgil did withstand. And so the Case came to Pope Zachary's hand. Who did decide against his Legate 'prentice That Lapsus linguae non est Error mentis. Now Boniface at Virgill shews his teeth, Who in his Sermon to the Legats griefe, Asserts there are Antipodes, hence he Reviled is as if more Worlds there bee As other men under the Earths greate space, Another Sun, and Moon. Hence Boniface, Comands him openly his Error gross For to Confess. And to retract as dross. But Virgill him Confutes, and out doth go And him accuseth to King Utilo But Boniface doth Zacharias Pope Stand at his Elbow who heard, (gave his rope I mean his Bull) to Utilo to fling Out Virgill if he don't recant this Sin. And send him unto him: he too Commands Sidony too, With Virgil to the hands Of Boniface to yield subjection good. Thus se the boiling of the Legats blood, Albertus, Clement, Samson others more Did Boniface oppose would not come o're. Nor yield their Churches to the Pope of Some. G? that he had the Crown of France in fume Turnd from Merobiu's lawfull race (strang tune) To Pipin's bastard progeny: and that He preacht Saints Worship, Purgatory-brat, And offerings for Dead men, and forbad Priests marriage and usd Exorcisms gad. And Women with him led about which brought In many persons many a jealous thought. But for their pains the Popes black Bull did low. They're damnd as Hereticks: presst by his brow. Thus Constantine a Synod calls Condemns, All Image Worship, Praying to dead men, And worshipping of Relicks: and Exiles From all Church fellowship men of such wiles. John Damascen doth go to pot indeed And other such ranck bishops: bishop weeds. He makes monks marry, and live honestly. And such doth claw who worship foolishly Contrary to Gods, and his Synods Law And pleade for Images, this vext Romes paw. 752A broile sprung up at Bandave all in feude. For Image worship. Some for Cesar stood Accurst them as shafts of Idolatry. But Hildebert the Blandine Abbat high And those with him mentaind them, to be grac'd With worship, and in temples to be plac'd. The Dispute grew so sharp that in the Close Hildebert's slain, and many a bloody nose. 757Pope Stephen peuks his Soule out, and there sprang Another bussle for a Pope (good man) Cannot be spar'd. Some like Theophylacy. And some Paul Deacon, now which side imbrace yee. Hence to't they go by th'ears and bang it out: And Paul comes in: His blades the other rout. 767But being dead another bout began In their Pope Choosing worke, do what they can. For Toto the Nepesine Duke too soon, With valient souldiers, coming unto Rome Strappadoed such as stood for Philip, and Made Constantine the Pope by might of hand. Whom when the Romans saw his stomach peukt 'Gainst Image worship him of's Popedom rookt. 777The Eagle, when Copronymus lay dead Shifts from his, to his Son, young Leo's head. And now two Abbats in Saint Vincents Hive How they might Charles the Great destroy Contrive. The Monks them take and unto Charles them send, Who doth them to Pope Adrian commend. But Autbert one kicks up in's walk to Rome. And Potho th'other comes and doth presume To purge himselfe of all he's Chargd withall And's set free thus: Sons of the Church! and fall! 782Constatine and Irenee now by hap Hav'ng th'Imperiall Crown dropt in their lap. Tarase the Bishop of Constantinople Late Constantine, whom Mary's wife did hopple Mew her up in a monastry, and wed One called Theodatee to his bed. Commands Monke Joseph, and the Abbate down And Theodatee decke with th'royall Crown. But Plato Abbate of Saccidio Abstaind hence from his Fellowship: but loe The Emperour him, and his monks exild And by this Persecution which them spoild A florid peace between them two sprung out: And Image Patriots they rose up Stout. But when Tarase observ'd that Images Among the Grecian Churches did displease And quarrells bredd, he of the Wreath obtains; 788An Universall Synod, which he names The Second Nicen, or the Seventh, which On Image Worship they did joyntly pitch. And so shake hands with Rome. And peace make, though 794Charls Magnus calld the Franckford Synod, who Did all the Pleaes this mongrell synods store Untruss, whip one by one all out of doore. It granted Images: but did forbid, Them with adoring Worship to be rid. And thus we see that Image mongers fling Out firy brands: and so Contentions spring, Ore all the Christian World: and make it fume. Things thus are wove in Superstitions loome The web is full of knots, Ends, Galls and Frets. And all the while Patience with tears bewets And wash her face therewith doth, till the shine Of Glory is grown great, upon her Shrine. Errours Out of Contentions Fire with burned Skins, My Muse doth leap: and Errours Palace brings Her Quills to Pen with all the glory bright Wherewith she richly Patience doth bedight, While at her Councill Table go Comissions For Lying, Heresies, and Supers[t]itions. Lies We now touch at the Coast of Rampant Lies, Some of the Continent of monstrous Sise My Pen shall here describe and first take that Which Authors give us as Charles Martills brat. Who did against his oath unto his King, 718Rise in rebellion, and in war all fling. The Saxons oft Contrary to their oath Against Charls did in bloody wars breake forth. The Popes, and all their Crew do make to fly A pieces faith that with their Prince they tie. When Pipin had him selfe by oath bound to King Chilperick, whom sourness did oreflow Hatcht in the good popes very loyall breast, Cause he the Long'bard would come t'molest, He brake his Oath and did the Kings own Cap I Crown should say did on his own head Clap. Which Vermin was proud Bonifaces brat Hatcht in his pate that he might be Romes Cat To Catch the Lombards, which, as mice, did eate The Cheese of Peters Patrimony greate Thassilo bound himselfe by oath unto Brisk Pipin, and his Sons, yet flew thence fro. Utilo did the like, and many more: Which to recite would make my pen grow sore. Irenee's Son namd Constantine doth feign Mary his Wife had poyson him to bain Prepar'd, which was a ly devisd that so He for another Wife might her off throw. The People of Constantinople gave Their Oath fair pend, that him alone they'l have Their Emperour. And after quickly sweare Unto Irenee; him they will not beare. Yet soon Irenee is deposd, and they Sweare that to Constatine they will obey. They Sworn, Forsworn, make swearing seem a Slight And ready seem to Sweare the Crow is white. Pope Paul is said out of a Marble tomb To dig the Corps up whole (Oh gracious boon) Of Petronilla Peters daughter, where He found a writing written very Cleare By Peter the Apostle's very hand. The which he read, 'twas this (Sir understand) To Aurea Petronilla ever my Most best delightfull Daughter. Oh fy, fy. These are some fetid lies, and many more I might sum up; but lies in doctrine store That Constitute fat Heresies do next, Come on, if Possible, Patience to vex. Heresies. Let Heresies Come on, hold up their hands. That in the hollow have receivd their brands. Old Heresies now barbd, as Montanists: The Manichean, and the Donatists Are found in many places: Arians too Furbusht in Monothelitithick hew In Syria a false Messiah rose, And did delude the jews to whom he shows. Some after Epicurian notions run: Asserting God his Governments not spun Over the World but all things come by chance Some after starry deities do dance, That do ascribe to Fate or Asterism The Justs Felicity, and that they're d[r]iven To hell that wicked are. And that they must Not Stand or Fall before Gods judgment just. But yet the Heresies the briskst of all, Is flowrishing now in the Churches Wall Mantled in Bishops Weeds: and snug doth ly In Image Worship, and Idolatry. Worshiping Angells, Saints, and deadmens bones: Nay bits of Wood, and Clouts: this all is known By that gross Superstition at which doore I now do knock, and heave on Shop board Store. Superstitions Now Superstitions fly blow all things, Crawl Like Magots on a fat sheeps taile: and sprawle. Temples they build, its well; but Didicate Unto Christ, Saviour, Angells, Saints, in State, To Michael, Mary, Peter Andrew, James To Stephen, Paul, John Baptist, other names In honour of Male Martyres: to Sabine To Adrian, Crispinian and Crispine. Off Females too, as to Saint Sapience Saint Maure, Saint Joan, Saint Sophy, (pritty sense) And these they Consecrate with Litany Mass Psalms, and Holy Oyle, and Names apply. And did it in the Name of th'trinity. And stow them do with Altars Consecrate Tables, and Candle Sticks Church-Chests and Plate Golden, and Silver Cups, and Sacred Vests And other things they lay up in these Chests. They Stow them also do with Crosses gay, To fright the Divell: Reliques here they lay. And Images of Christ of Angells, Saints Ore lay'd with Gold, and Silver: Some in Paints. All to be worshipt, and adored herein. Some Abraham have his Isaack offering. Some have the Gospell painted, on the walls Some have th'Six Universall Synod all, Rich gifts, they did adorn them with: the Gloves Of Gayfry Duke of Aquitain, whence moves Greate glory, all Stuck ore with Unions And other Costly Gems, and Pretious Stones. King Pipin hung up in Saint Denyse by The golden Cross o're the great Altar, high. And Luitprand did didicate unto Saint Peters Alter, Sword, Belt, Jewells so. Pillars they had of Marble Some, but loe Eutyce Six Cry and Pillars did bestow Saint Peter on, in Gregory Terse his time, And now how gloriously doth Peter Shine? They now made brazen Grate works hedging in The Table where none come, expeld for Sin. Kings Crowns adornd with Gems are lodged here. Pope Adrian did in Mary's Church up rear Rich golden Dolphins brave through sevrall Crowns. Gregry the third set with six Dolphins brown A Silver Crown; and a gold Coronet With a bright Cross in Genese's Church up set. Gregry the Second made a Pulpet all Of Marble in Jerusalem Church-hall. Before Church Images they Candles light And Frankincense do burn. Strang gods a might! Their Temples too Cities of Refuge are. None may be halled thence that do repare Under their shadow upon lesser pain Than Excommunication to sustain Nicetas sat here in a Throne in state While Constantine was Excommunicate. The Fonts for Baptism in Churches stand Which Consecrated are by Priests at hand And here they do baptize both babes and men, With Water, Oyle, and salt. Godfathers then Did give them Gifts. And Deusdedit Pope Two Wooden Dishes both alike set ope Adornd with Gold and Gems gave to two boyes In token that he did the same baptize. They now baptize their Clocks and Bells and hung Papers by sign posts Storms to void and shun. The Supper of the Lord they solemnize In Gold, and Silver vessells set likewise Upon a Wooden Table. Hence its said By Winofride, the former dayes displaid All Golden Priests but wooden Cups: but we Now Golden Cups but wooden Priests do see. The supper was administred in Vests, All White but Charles his Priest's in purple dresst[.] The English usd a Cruse and Dish of horn At Sacrament, till Adrian did forewarn And lay his Charge upon them not to have Horn Cups, and Chargers in such Service grave The French did Infants to this Table bring. Hence Charles the Great's appointment up did spring, That Priests have ever by, the Eucharist For Babes and Sick folk; 'fore death them off twist. They Pray and massify, for quick and dead: And Pray as at Consecrated places shed. And over graves: they go to Rome to pray. Cast ashes on their heads: Face Eastward lay. Processioning with Prayers Pope Leo usd When tumbld from his Saddle he was bruisd Constantinople Siegd by Saracens Was Circuited about on friday then. The Virgin Maries Image held on high They Calld upon, with such Idolatry. Thou Holy Bearer of our God, who hast So oft deliverd us, to free us hast From foes unto thy Son. And if thou wilt Not have us drown thy Image, we have built, Here in the Sea: drown them within the Sea. And Quickly then the foes did fly a way. Now Boniface affirmd, it Capitall To wed a Godsons mother (Judgd ye all) Monasteries, and Nunneries abound: Wherein most monstrous wickedness is found. Yet this Moguntine Boniface, did bring From England such to preach the Gospell King. Lisba did preach at Bishoffsheim the word: Tecla at Kizing on the Mogus ford: Chunild, and Chunitrade, and Beragyth And Valdopurge shackld all in his with Did preach the word Contrary to Saint Paul Who will not have a woman preach at all. But yet these Swarms of Abbies: Lubber-looms, Or Hives of drones, sing such bewitching tunes, Nobles Dance after them, as Leo who Crept in Cassina goose pen: many go To others. Nay these Fiddles make kings Crowns Skip from their heads for them to dwell with Clowns. In a King of West Saxons; Offa Easts, Kenred, Ethelbald, Offa Kings possest Of th'Mercian Kingdoms: glory and another King Kenred, Celulfe, Egbert, too whose Cover Was the Northumber Crown, all Englands Kings, Their Crowns for Monkish Cawls did Chang. Strange things! Rachis King of the Longbard did the same, And Charloman King Pipins brother came From's Royall Scepter like imployment bright To roost in such a bird Cage, black as night. His Royall Queen-like Spouse became a Nun: And so King Ina's Queen Ethelberg run Into the Nunnery at Barking neer To London, and the Abbass died there. But to return (for of this sort no more) This Boniface, who by his terrour sore Did in Bavaria set the Pope's black brands, Upon an hundred thousand persons hands Brought German Grists unto his Water mill Of Masses, Purgatorie, Prayres that fill Saints ears (or Satans rather), Prayrs for th'Dead, Of Relicks Superst[it]ions, black and red. Did thus assert, although the Pope be found His, and the Folks Salvation slighting, Crownd With works remiss and vain, a Dumb dog bee So that he lead by troops doe down, wee see, Innumerable people unto hell In Everlasting Plagues and scourgings t'dwell, Whereby he wounds himselfe, and all men more. No mortall may presume with Checks his Cure. For he is judge of all, and judgd of none May be, said he, What doctrine hath this Don? By these, and such like things, as these, we finde Patience is saddld that her Grace is Shrinde. Superstitious Legends for Imagery. In th'Virgin Mary's Monastry, built by Constantinoples Palace, hangs on high The Image of the Virgin with a Babe Drawn in her Arms, which while a live, Luke made Wherewith each Fryday they Procession make, Through all the City. Thus they did to shake The Fleet of Saracens at Sea, as wee A little time before did make you see. Which, when they finisht had their prayre to't all, He that them led made under th'waters fall, Then rose a Storm that brake and sunke the fleet. Oh! Curst Idolatry, makes Patience weep. The plague that in Constantinople, and Cicill, Calabria, and the Crosses-brand Made on their Vests, and Vails Chargd Constantine Not to abolish Image Worship fine. At Berytus Christs Image by a Jew Reviled, blood and Water from it flew Out of its Wounded side, which sick folk Cure The which the Bishop there in Vessells pure 765Is said to save, ore all the world to send, And so Novembers Ides the fift Commend Yearly to Selibrate as holy day The Passion of Christs Image: Sing huzza. Constantine Artabasdu's Stable groom A stone at th'Virgins Image did presume To hurle, and struck it down, and kickt too. Then in a Vision she stood by him, true? And said thou stoutly 'gainst me acted hast. But this thou hast against thine own head plac'd. And after when the Saracens up drew Their force against the Walls, a stone that flew: Out of an Engin smote him on the pate, And malld his Face to pieces. Image, Prate. An Herdsman who struck with his Goad out quite, The right Eye of the Virgins image bright: Did Smite when in the field, his own Eye out, When he would strike the Cattle in a rout. Another naild the Image through the head Drawn on the Wall. And grievously he sped. His head did ach so sore, naught could avale, Untill he had out drawn the former naile. An Hagaren that would pluck out an Eye Of this Choice Draught, at Gobala, did stroy One of his own. And what hereby good Sir? What Image Worship? Fy. Here is no Spur. For Saints appearing, and giving Commands. etc. James Son of Zebedee did thrice appeare To Charles, and bad him go and his Spain where He lay at rest: from Saracens all free And he should Crownd be with Eternall glee. Pope Stephen said Saint Denyse to him Came And him restor'd to health, and bad him frame An Abtin in the Abby Paris hath To honour God, Peter, and Paul, he saith. When Luitprand Augustine's Relicks would From Sardine bring to Ticine's Charrot could Not be on drawn by force, nor Skill untill He on Augustine calld saying I will This Village where I stay bestow on those That are thy Priests: and on the Charrot goes. A Nun saw in a Transe a woman slip Among them then below dropt in Hells pit, Redeemed thence by Mass, and said the Mass For Souls so packing very usefull was. The Pope or Bishop, Euchary is said To see Charles Martills Soul in hell, who made Havock of Churches goods to mannage wars. They op't his Grave and a great Snake there stirs. Greg'ry the third Unto Duke Eudo sent Three Consecrated Sponges, to his tent. Hee Cut them all in bit[s], and gave them to His Host, that out gainst Saracens did go. And none that had thereof was slain, or hurt, Hence Consecrated things for Safeguards spurt. These hellish lies my Pen doth ake to shew. Patience doth bleed to finde them spoke as true. One more I'le mention not without a Smile, Beholding how their pens they thus defile. When at Gangulfe his funerall, the Sick By touching of his Heirse were heald, out skip A Maid doth and tells to his wife the thing, Who thus repli'd, My bum as well doth Sing As doth my Husband wonders worke, and lo As long as life did last, as stories go, She had a pair of bagpipes in her bum Which made wind musick when she usd her tongue And Pipin calling of the Woman found The thing was true. So Gangulfe's Fame doth sound. Well to Conclude by what is said, wee say Those are all dipt in Errours who display Such things as these, and though they others curst, For Heresies, the Worst Theefe Cries thief first But, oh the Patience! while these things thus run Its Glory hence out shines the Shining Sun. The Shine of Divine Justice. Patience, Stand by. Come, Justice, give thy hand, That I may shew it White, though some think tand. Though hitherto I other Shines did tend Thou shinest all the while, and now I bend My back unto thy burden that thy name May laid in Gold deck th'Hauraldry of Fame. Greate Sins bring dismall Plagues, now out there comes Gisulfe the Long'bard, and Campania bums, The Contrey Beneventine wasts, ore turns Many Italian Cities down he burns. And Mahameth with Hagarens infest Armenia, and the Roman Chiefs there prest Are Caught, and burnt. Egypt revolts and makes Herselfe a King, who th'title Caliph takes. The Saracens rend Lybia away And Africk from th'Imperiall Charge, and Sway. Justinian doth return, takes Absimare Who wronged Phillipicas, and payes his fare, In tryumph led him, on his neck did tread And after this did sever off his head. Justinian Reemperor'd still takes No warning but in tyranny out brakes, He finds a righteous hand persues his Reign. Ulid the Saracen Damascus gains Their Temples doth to Mahomet devote: Masalmas playes the tyrant: Abbas float With hosts against Romania: Muctan Cilician Cities wasts, and playes the man. 709Justinians league with Bulgars rotton twine, Shall not him fetter, arms against them shine. They in a terrour to the mountains fly, But seing thence his army stragling, high Fall on them kill and slay, Justinian Shuts Himself up in a Castle, and then cuts His Horses Hamstrings, and in Ships at sea Unto Byzant with shame did slinke away. Now Italy look to thyselfe, thy sin Brings in thy woe Asprand the Long'bard king By right, yet banisht, got Bavarian aide In Italy did Come, Colours displaid Routs Aribert, who drownds himselfe then in Ticineum Stream, and did his Kingdom win. 712Justinian whom the Chersoneses sought To slay when in Exile, his army brought Them to destroy Man, Woman, Child also. His Captains yet on Children pitty show. Prince Tadane, Zele and fourty Chiefe ones more These with their families in Chains they bore Unto the Emperour. And twenty tost Into the Sea: and seven they Spit, and rost. Those Sav'd he bids them send him: rind therein A tempest Seventy thousand down did bring. Reveng not Cloy'd an army new he sent Commanding all the Infants Death and spent His rage to levell all down to the Soile And hence the Chersonee's seing such spoile Sought Chajane's Succour: and Justinians host Appoint Philippicus to rule the rost. His former wicked Counsell Theodore Lievetenant Stephen too were slain before, Who tortured were exceedingly then burn'd To death were in a brazen Bull. Then turnd Against him now at Synopee, and take Him and Tyberius his Son, and make Them with his Grandam Anastasia finde By deaths grim Sentence, justice is not blinde, 713The Bulgars now wast Thrace, come to the Doores Of greate Constantinople. Scarce came ore To Philippick Armenia's forth part. 714The Arabians Mistia get: Abbas out start Did and destroys Pisidia's Antioch. 713And Bishop Anepos with Francks out broke 'Gainst Wilian on the Sweves: and here is made A dismall Slaughter, and a bloody trade. 715Philippick lost his Eyes, and Crown, up springs Now Anastase even when Masalmas brings His army wasting of Galatia: And do for Leo there their net display. And Pergamus besiege wherein arose A vile Magician, saith they'st beat their foes If they a woman Split up greate with Child Imbrew their right hands in that blood, all Soild And in a pot do boile her fruit, which done God slew them by the foes, which victory won. Now or the yeare before an Earth quake rings To them a Peale in Syria as it Springs. Plectrude King Pipins widdow hands did lay In Colen on her Step son Charles, got Sway With nephew Th'odoald Mayer of the Hall 715Who war'd with Reginfred and so lost all. And flew to Dagobert, and force renews The Countrey by the Mose his tumult Rues. Charles Martill from his step dams pinfold Slips Fights for the Rules: the Enemy quite Strips All places on the Rhene: will not desist Till from Plectrude hugh Mony Sums they twist[.] 717Leo Lievetenant in the East up rose And Theodose his Empirhood ore throws. The Long'bards now about in Italy Took Cuma, but the Pope it got soon by The Duke of Naple, and the Roman blades. 718Mardasan with his Arabs now invades Numedia unto Nice: Masalmas stroyes Cesaria Capadocian. Greate woes rise. The Saracens in East and West invade Do Europe. Zulemon a fleet out plaid Of many hundred (of three thousands strong Some say) which did like Bees in Thrace out throng. Masalmas ore Abydes whisks. Gizid From Egypt with three hundred saile too slid, Beat down the Thracian Castles, and Surround Th'Imperiall City, whose right Fire ships found Their Fleet, and many burnt, judgments now tumble Upon their Head: which now begin to rumble. A Dismall winter doth them storm and stroy, Men, Horses, Camells, Zulemon, too, die. Among the Saracens hunger's so greate Horse, Ass, and Camells, and mans flesh they eate, Yea their own Excrements in oven bakt, 719And Death by Plagus down many of them shakt. They ran a plundring in Bulgaria Thirty two thousand of them fell this way. The rest after a two, or three years seege Depart, but judgments sent break up their Siege. The wallowing Seas boild up with Storms thrown down Of Fiery Haile from heaven all to Crown 720Their pitchy Ships with all, which on them Cling On Neptune's Altar they a burnt offring Are made by justice. Onely ten a pass Obtain'd to go, and tell the thing as't was. Five to the Roman hands Came with this newes. The other five to Syria did Carews. 720In Spain they also rush, when Julian Lievtenant was of Tangitana, th'man (Whose Daughter Cana Roderick defild In Spain while he was there, whose Choler boild, For this abuse) against his Prince brought in Musa, and Tariff with their Moore, to sting, Two hundred and ten thousand horse, and foot. Before Tariff a woman this did toote, She heard her learned father say that Spain Should Conquourd be by one that did sustain A Mole on his right Shoulder, and who had One hand too long for t'other. He then glad, Having these marks did heart his men hereby To fight King Roderick Couragiously Of Foot and Horse Eightscore five thousand Strong. Seven dayes the Fight from morn to night was long, And Roderick routed, robes exchang'd, they say, With a Sheepkeeper, and so ran away And ne're more heard of was but in the fight Fall ten and threescore thousand. Oh! Sad sight. But Julian who did his Counterey Betray, when in this wretched tragedy He saw his Wife, and Children perish thus, They Starvd to death in Prison. Justice Flush. 718France also Smoaks, soakt by Charles Martills war, Gainst Chilperick, and Reginfride's his jar. 722And four years after having gaind the Crown. Brave King up grew of flourishing Renown[.] On he proceeds gainst their Confederats Duke Eudo Aquitans, him straps and shaks All Aquitain. Who Moores from Spain then calls, They all wast Burgundy on Poictiers fall, And on to Tours and Martins temple Stroy. Then he and Eudo Splice, and on them fly. 730The King three Hundred, eighty thousand Strong They with the loss of fifteen hundred bom, He on the Frizers falls and off them payes, 735Persues them flying to Rhene's isle and slayes Man, Woman, Children too and on he sets Their Crown on's head, all's fish that comes to's nets. Now Italy look to't, thy Popes who do Empires and Realms dispose Knaves all a row. 738The Cup comes to thy doore For Luitprand Doth Clusium Spoile: and then Bononia and The towns thereof Mount Vely, and Favence, And Forojule, Foropopily, thence Caseria, and Auxime, and thence doth come And Siegeth Rome, against it Sounds his Drum. But fearing Pipin, back he turns away 739Amery, Orta, Polimarce, Blera, Cities of Roman Dukedoms takes and came Unto Spoleto tooke he 'fore. Pope! Shame. The West Goth's that do still abide in Spain, 736Amaizd to See him Aquitan to gain, 737Call the Burgundians first then th'Saracens. 739Whom all he beats, and doth Secure their dens[.] In Scotland, they together go by th'ears, The Picts slay Ambeclet their King. Hence tears. Egbert King of Northumberland doth find His people Factious. ruin hence inclinde. Thus while they fight for Saint-Idolatry God's Justice thus doth Scourge them righteously. 741Come to Copronymus his time who still Doth Image worship stroy. They him to kill Conspire with Artabasd, but miss their aime Hence God still plagues them by th'Arabian flame. Nay Civill war is brewd, but Artabasd Goes to the worst: he's taken, so it was, And hath his eyes pluckt out and banished And such as with him image faction bred. The Bulgars them molest awhile The Turke 764Breake from the Caspin Ports Armenia jeark The Huns again taking Atilas track Two hundred Sixteen thousand out do pack From Scythick bags, in Seven troops into Pamonia at length come, and pitch do. Tumults abound, war in Bavaria Sweve, Almans have it and Saxonia Rome now, and Italy the Long'bords Scourge Till Charles and Pipin prove to be its purge The Frisers kill Moguntine Boniface Who did Rome's Ceremonies give the Grace To mare the glory of the Churches shine In France and Germany when in the prime. Abbas that rag'd against the Christians did Doth now untruss, and justice now doth bid To pay him home, an Ethiopian, A pair of Bellows full of lime did fan And blow into his nose, and mouth, and face Dies Choakt there with, justice will keep her place. Abdellas too dranke of this Cup when God The Tower threw on his head and made him nod. 777Copronymus his Son young Leo rose Takes from the Church a Crown that glory shows Bedeckt with Jasper Stones, and other gems And he therewith rounds in his head and hems. And justly turnd this Scoff on prelates proud, It is not meet that hee, that is avowd To poverty should Crowned be with Pearls. He also down all imag worship hurles. But God provoked by this wicked age Still scurgd the East with the Arabian rage. Syria is made a butchers Shambles still Maday his troops to Doryleum drill. Irthuma Asia harrasses, and spoils. Saxonia still in war with Charles up boils. In little Bittain he disturbed is. When Sins breake out justly the rod we kiss. 782Irenee with her Son poor Constantine After the Peoples humour run enshrine Do Images and worship them, and lo All things a Snick Snarles run and they down grow. The Arabs make Asia Armenia too To groan. Thrace, Greece, and Thessaly do rue, Pancrace th'Astrologer for Constantine Doth Conquest ore Bulgarians divine He therefore goes to tread them down to dirt But Cardan with his Armie falls to work, Kills, routs, and beats his army, and Pancrace And Chiefest Captains slayes, and in disgrace The Emp'rour flies, losing his Mony, and His Horses, Tents, and all his Royall strand. 784Justice doth pay Astronomy its debt. And also that which Imageworship set. Parnonia smarts, the Huns and Avars there 800With the Bavarians 'gainst Charles appeare. Who smoaks their Sides and almost roots them out. And so in Saxony his foes too routs. He bangs the Sclaves, and makes them to him bow. Italy bleeds, he holds the Popes long plow And gives them ease, Irenee and he stakes Do part. She all on th'right hand Naples takes With Sicily. And he doth take the rest. He bangs the Saracens in Spain possesst. 785In England things go ill: the thievish Danes Break in on them. Northumberland doth gain And this bright Justice, Romes Idolat[r]y Both Old, and New, doth treate accordingly. But to return to give some instance here 783Elpidy who in Sicily dreamed there (When Irenee had sent him there to rule) He should be Emperour of all, (great foole) But being beaten out of Sicily Flew to th'Arabian[;] they him take for joy, And boot him do, and with a Diadem Him Crown in Scorn. Romes Emperour! ahem! So Charles his bastard Crumpbackt Pipin, who Was Eldest Son, Conspir'd his Fathers woe, With Certain Peers of France, which broacht, his dad 792Into Monastick Penance thrust his lad. And others, Who had fingers in this Crime. He treats according to a righteous shine[.] 792Constantine, who heights Image mongers high, His wicked mother cuts him, and hereby She holds the Wreath imperiall alone For Seven years, then he again the throne Injoyes with her: and in her wickedness A joynt partaker is: did dispossess Alexy, and Nicephorus their Eyes. At Molosis: some tongues cuts out likewise. And five years after on that very day He thus did act, his mother tooke away His Eyes, and Empire too most treacherously. And this Cut justice kept, its Eye for Eye. Its said the Sun at this most impious fact, Winkt seventeen dayes, in which her rayes they lackt But Justice stayes not long before she send, Her martial out who knocks, and m? that end Upon her Doore, and her arrest. For she Is Ceised by her Herdsman and must bee Divested of Imperiall Dignity And treasure, banisht, and at Lesbon die. Oh Justice Glorious, let all adore Thy Shining Beams scatterd the World all o're. Thou writest thy Glory oft in blood, in Fire, In water, Plagues, in Cruelties in Ire, Sometimes in Glory greate, and evry way, That all may yield unto thy Scepter sway. This Sinfull Century doth witness give Whose wickedness would make thee cease to live And if it could: but can't, for thou di[d]st strike Thy beams through out the same which do requite Its wickedness so that thy Glory flames In all those judgments that do Sins disdain. I therefore now thy threashold do stride ore That is thus bright, unto another doore. Divine Efficiency. Divine Efficiency in all these things Doth more than darkly shine within these Clouds. But now I come to ope her golden wings And show her glory in this Age which Crouds In hints not ordinary in whose folds Justice more Wreaths too hang as in her holds. 704When that Justinian to Cajan fled From Absimare, by ship a Tempest greate So hard lay on them, danger great brought dread. Majaces Knight Crys, Sir, we dy: Oh make A Vow to God, If God thy Empire shall Restore to thee, thou'lt punish none at all. To whom he said if of them ought I spare Let in this very place God drown me then. Which spoke Danubius grew Calm, and fare. Which they without all danger up did stem. 715Poor Syria danses to an Earthquakes pipe. 717The Moon Ecclipsd seems bloody halfe the night[.] 718Rathbod Duke of the Frisers by the Pains Of Vulfrans Sermons came to be baptizd. And one foot in the Waters, now restrains, Where are the greater part of them I prizd, My ancestors? in Heaven? or in Hell? An answer to this question give, me tell. And hearing most was gone to hell drew back I'le rather go with most, than few'st he said. The Divell then never to mischiefe slack. Transformed like a glorious Angell, ray'd In robes of Gold and a gold Diadem Upon his head studed with many a Gem. Spake thus, Most Valient Sir, who drew thee so. To leave the Worship of the Gods? Ne're do'te Abide in what thou learndst, then thou shalt go To golden Palaces of glorious note, Which I will give thee soon Eternally, (This Rothbod to Priest Ovo did descry) The Fiende goes on, to morrow Vulfran call The Christians Doctor, and aske thou of him Whats that Eternall Splendors Palace hall Which he doth promise thee, Sir know the thing. Which When he could not do: both parts agree And Send the Divells golden Hall to see. Rothbod tells Vulfran, He'l be Christ'ned then And if his god this Splendid hall Shew not: A Friser, and a Deacon are the men. Sent out with whom when out of th'town they got The Divells Pilot coming went, cries, high I'le shew the stately Hall Duke Rothbad's joy. And on they trudge a long a broad broad way. A Path with various kinds of marble dresst And Hall like gold far off they saw, and they Came to a Street before it paved best With gold and Pearls. And in't they go, and saw It was an house whose glory had no flaw. Its Glory was to admiration, and Its Splendor was incredible so bright. And in't a throne of wondrous Sise did Stand. This is Prepard Duke Rathbod said that Wight. At which the Deacon in a maze replide, If these are made by God, let them abide. If by the Divell, let them perish Soon. And Signd himselfe with Cross, their Pilot then Appeard the Divell: singing such a tune, The golden Palace dropt to dirt, the men Stood in a marshy place all brambly spred And walking three days home the duke found dead. 722Shaffnaburg saith, it rained like a Shower Parcht Corn, and Barly, Pulse, in Company. Great plenty after this the sands out poure. And Pagans turn to Christ in Saxony. 727The Sea betwixt Thera and Therase iles As from a furnace, Fire out thence up boiles. Which going on for many dayes grew greate The igneous fume appeard inflamd with fire. Its Earthy Substance bread Pumice Stones greate, Of which in heapes all Scattred ore intire Abydos, Lesbon, Asia, and the Coasts Of Macedony lay: in mighty hosts. And in the middle of this mighty fire An isle Concocted was of'ts Crusser parts Which to the Sacred Iles, did fast retire. An Emblem of the Popes heat that by arts Spewd out the Emperours, and boild french kings Of th'Excrementa to Sacred Popes that Cling. 729Two blazing Stars attend the Son, the one His Usher is seen in the morn before him, The other's serving man in th'Eve made known To bare his train up after and adore him. 735A firy Sign in heaven out now shines 740And in the Sun, Moon, Stars too, God sends Signs. The Earth doth take a dance a twelvemonth long. Stroys many at Constantinople too Down Temples, Abbies, images do come, Great Constantine's Attili Gate down threw. Great Thedez Statue seen ore th'golden gate. And many Thracian Cities feele like fate. And Nicomedy in Bithynia, Prenetus too and Nice are tumbled down: In which last nam'd one Chappel up did stay. 741The Sea breaks prison like a prisond Clown. Constantinople quickly after rues. Justice will play her gain; and Sin persues. 743Great Draught; and Earthquakes now the mountains greate In Saba-Wilderness together kiss. 744A Comet north shines out, the Cloudy Seate Rains ashes down. Another Earthquake is In th'Caspin Bay, great flocks of Eagles rise And from our Tables dresst, their prey Surprize. 745A Comet sends it's beams in Syrian Eyes. 746A foggy Darkness from the Augusts ides, Unto Octobers Calends lasts likewise, Places by Jordan, Syria all ore slides By Earthquaks which Churches and Abbies spoiles Plague foams in Continents and mid sea Iles. 751In Syria an Earthquake ruin made Now Cities some it upside down did pitch Some onely shatterd, some it then display'd To lower, plain, and Champion places rich All walking, Men, Cities and Wall intire At least a six miles journey, wood and fire. 753In briefe such who beheld this with their eyes, Mesopotamy, do affirm, was torn For two miles Space. Out of which depth did rise An other soile all white and Sandy born. Out of which rose a Mulelike cleanly beast, Which with a humane Voice spake e're it ceast. It said a nation should an inrode make Against th'Arabians from the Wilderness. 760A blazing Star in th'East ten dayes out brake Another one and twentie dayes shown fresh. 761The Turks rush from their dens the Caspin baye. And inroads make do in Armenia. A Dismall Frost assails the World this year Octobers Calends did the same begin. The Pontine Sea an hunderd miles frose were. Whose ice was thirty Cubits thick within. From top to bottom certainly the main Such Covering as this did nere more gain. From Lycia to the Danow, to Euphra, Donastre, Danowper, and Mecropel All ore to Mesembry, and Maesia, Even through all Countries this freezing fell, And on the ice a Coverlid of Snow 'Bove twenty Cubits thick was drawn also. The Sea as firm as Land was trudgd on by Both men, and beasts, Beasts Wild and Tame apace, From Cazars, Bulgare, and the Iles there nigh[.] The ice, when February shews its face Did breake in pieces and swim down unto Danupsy, and to Hiero did flow, In such a Sort they went to th'City, and To Propont, and the Iles, and to Abyde. Filling the bancks and fields a Sea side land We the Eyewitnesses the pieces eyd We went with thirty equall agd to us On one of them alone the sliding thus. There Living Creatures were upon the Same Both Wild, and tame: Some dead, and some alive. And whose would did without let pass plain From Sophian to th'City, and arrive By land from Chrysople to Mamas aye To th'places which are Called Galathi. One piece against a Step struck of Acrople Did break, and brake it all to pieces quite Another of huge bulk with wall did graple And with a mighty knock did Clash it streight, So that the houses that within it are Are made to have with tumbling Sea their Share. It Being into three parts Split did round The City from Mangane to Bosphorus, Was higher than the Walls, we all scapt sound With much ado Men, Women, Boyes with us. And home returnd with tears in our eyes Not knowing what we could for this devise[.] This yeare in March Starrs fell out of the Sky And all that saw them strucken were with feare They thought the end of all the World was nigh 767Great draught in Thrace, Pits, Baths, Springs Rivers were Dry at Constantinople they take Care, The Valentinian Conduit to repare. 772Great Charles in's Saxon wars when he down struck The fane of Hermansal felt three days thirst: Then nigh an hill there suddenly a brook To their relieve with plentious waters burst. 776At Hersburg Siege, Christians, and Saxons spy Two bloody flaming Shields Shakt in the Sky. 778'Bout February Sol's Eclipst at noon When Luna her Ecclipse had but three dayes Passt o're. And lo Mercuries Star full soon After the Same is seen by Such as Gaze At Stars, within the middle of the Sun Appearing like a Small black Spot there run. 779Now France doth tast of Famine, Plague, and war When Charles in arms 'gainst Agaland the Moore. Some Souldiers stuck their Spears down as they are In th'meads by Caja Streams the day before They Entred Fight, which on the morn were found Adornd with flourishing leaves and barks all round. 787Now In Frisinga Field the aire all Cleare, And Still there fell wood of a various kinde Out of the Skies, Images now they reare, Some thinke the Same was by this wood assignd There now was blood raind down its said also Even from the Skies another Sign of woe. 788And firy Dragons through the aire did fly When Bitrick the West Saxon King did reign. Famin and Danes did follow by and by. 791An Earthquak makes Constantinople train From houses into open fields lest shee Should rattle down, and they destroyed bee. At Rome too Tyber overflows its bounds Stroies the Flammian Gate also the bridge Antonius Pius built whose ends redounds On Aventine, and on Janicles ridge. It sweep away did many building brave And City Monuments by its Strong wave[.] When Charles the Great would by a channell Chain The Rhene and Danow thats together Dug Greate heaps of Corn, of Evry sort of grain, They found in th'fields which kill their beasts that Cud It in, and't vanisht in their hands when ground. Lascive and lowing noises nightly sound. Confused noises and Continuall rain About the Channell that he dug appeare That force him from his work and it refrain. 797Sicill and Crete by Earth quake shatterd were. 798Irenee blinds her Son, and him Dethrones. And th'Sun grew darke: and days seventeen nere shone. And Mars his Star this year's not seen i'th'Sky. In July frost Congels the water hard That Ice are found. Behold Efficiency Doth ware its glory with a glorious guard Of wonders to effect our hearts that wee May furle the Same with praises rich that bee. The Shine of Divine Truth Sweet Truth I come into thy Quarters do O let me kiss thy hand and view The Splendor of thy Sun and show Those beams that from it flew. The Star dropt from the Heaven with the Key Of th'boundless Pit, its doore unlockt And now the Smoake doth Steam away The aire with fogs hath Stockt. The Smoake of Purgatory fire, and Mass And Imageworship, pray'res unto Angells and Saints with Romish trash Makes darkness overflow. And in this Smoake the Spawn doth generate The Egge is in the Egge poke nigh Sheld over, not in Winde Egge State, Some in the nest do ly. And Some begin to drop: but nests are built In e'ry Copse: the Spring comes on And Locust quickly out will tilt And fly apace therefrom. The Little horn is spouted up a loft And doth through pride now fan the aire Will any Crop him (nay Sir soft) Oh! do it if you dare. The Eastern Realm in Italy he outs Breakes off the Long'bards by the Francks. Two of the three Horns he ore Strouts The third shall feele his prancks. The Scarlet Whore with Golden Cup in hand Hath not it yet filld to the brim. Her nose is stilling in it, and Makes more filth in it swim. The Christendom of Bells and Clocks do pearch Upon its brim ready to drop Into it but Greate Charles his birch Did make it back thence hop. Greg'ry the Seconds Skeg the juyce in't slips Of Unallegienceation first. A Consecrated Sponge forth trips From Greg'ry tersh, and burst. And Zacharias that rank Sodomite Dropt this strong Spirit in thereto In th'Name of th'Trinity aright Church Consecrations go. He plumpt herein the Popes Unswaring Power Which all the World calls Perjury. Unemporizings and Unkingings Shower Out of his Cloudy Sky. And a King making Realm translating knack He Squeezd herein. Oh juycy Crab. Untried lard for bats did Crack His points with a male drab. From Stephen Persh Pope Zachary's Knag there falls This Spice in't that on Each Lords day Sung by Seven weekly Cardinalls Glor'in Excellis bee. Leo the third's drop comes, he Constitutes Saint Lignums day out of whose side, The very blood of Christ forth shoots When Jews it Crucifide. His Constitution too of Frankincense Cast on the Altars Pagan like. Puts in this Cup. And by such pence If not yet, soon will strike. These drops unto the former in the Cup Of Filthy Whordoms fall, which shee, Brings to her Kings and they must sup The Same who do her fee[.] The ten Kings Sacrifice to her their Power. Englands, France, Italies, and Spains. Into his Clinck their Swords do skoure. She hates their splendid rains[.] Iva doth grease her fist with Peter Pence. French kings are birds of her own feather. The Goth of Spain proove her defence And Italy's her Teather. She Charles the Great Dubs Emperor of Rome And in his Forehead set this Star MOST CHRISTIAN KING Which Star doth bloom On all his Stems thus far. All Kings accept her Mark Her whordoms all Subject unto: her trash doth run Over all Kingdoms. Great and Small, Bath in her Shining Sun. She now Change Genders doth. She now grows Hee. Is Lord of Lords: and King of Kings. Plucks off Whose Crown she lists, a fee She to her bantlings flings. Poor Chilperick's Step'd in her Cuckow Cage, A golden Crown's a Shavling made. Nay many Princes of this age Take up a monkish trade. Cages for whom Great Charles as many build As letters in the Alphabet With noble Stipends did them guild, Here Abby Lubbers get. But now this horn advanc'd above the Stars Sits in Gods throne as thronde therein. Disturb him though a Star, he arrs His Sacred Chops will grin. Great things his mouth lets fly He'l at you fling His thundering Anathemaes. Thus serv'd he Thassilo the king That wore Bavarias bayes. But this is Gentle dealing. Worse he thumpd The Eastern Emperours about About their Ears when them he mumpd Unchurcht, unempird out. Nay Kings now count it honour did to kiss, His petty toes. What pride is here? But Glorious Truth foretold all this And hence she shines out cleare. When lyes thus smoother truth, that Truth should shine: And Falshood Choake? What wonder's here? That Lyes which banish Truth Divine Should hand it in all Clear? Yet thus it is, whence let us it adore, Which through dark Clouds doth shine so light. And thus this Century dark, all ore Spangld with Glory bright. CENTURIE. 9 I now put of my hat, and bow Farewell Eighth Century, unto thy State, the Bell Doth tole me to the nin'th, to which I high: It is thy Passing Peale to put thee by. But yet the morning Bell, and Chimes that tune My Pen and Inckhorn from their Bed to prune The Vineyard of the following Century. And on the Vintage workes good Husbandry, And Gather in the Same. And Wine fats tend, And with its blood its Squeezed Veans out send Fill up the Casks Grace, Patience, Justice and Efficiency, and Truth put in my hand To fill for them: and so their Glory Scan And on the Sign Post of this Century hang. 1. GRACE. Our All is now from Grace. Her Glory first Is to be gather'd up. Her Chrystall Cask Comes to the fat first to be filld: and rurst Up with the Wine, which is this ages task: And though its mean we tun it to us unmaskt. Asia's Shine. Jerusalem thou gate of Gospell Grace Whence first it Sprung to others, scarce doth shine Thomas thou hast thy Bishop who did trace Idolatry. Alas! Poor Palestine Here, and at Bethlehem some few make wine At Antioch in Syria some few As Paul, Job and Theophilus who were Their Preachers but of What Complection'd hew We know not, and in Lydia's Sardis peare. Euthymius of Image Shapen geer. In Lycaonia, and Phrygia In Asia Minor Christians still are found Bythinia: Galatia's Ancyra Thebasas and Andraseny did sound The Gospell trump. John Cyzicum did round. Christians in Cappadocia there were Whom Machael did as naked men all Stript Taking his Soulders thence, unto the geer Of Slaughter for the Saracens there slipt Here at Cesarea John the Gospell lipt. Inger at Nice Was bishop who opposd All Image worship to his dying day Theophanes him followd who there closd With such King Alfride sent Sigel away Of Shirburn to St. Tom. of India. Africa's Lights. Poor Asia almost Lost. alas! alas! I come to Africa in Egypt were A famous light, now small Achilles was The Alexandrian light, and Joseph there Lewis the Second alms for Africk steers. In Lybia Some gleanings still abide. Mahometans these Climates so infest There are but few the Gospell barge to guide And men of name we finde not here possesst. At which great Sorrow doth Constrain my breast. Ilands of the Mediterranian Sea. In Cyprus Churches Still are found which were 806Destroy'd by Saracens, yet others Spring. The Cyclides had too. And Lemnus there And Rhodes, Crest, Sardis, Corsica wherein Saracens usd there Cruell hands to bring. Majorca, Patalare, Cephaleny Venice, and Protee iles, Sicilia Lippara felt Saracen Cruelty In testimony that the Gospell way Was still attended here in these this day. Europe's Shine. Joseph a Thessalonian Bishop was And likly too a very Holy man. Constantinople calls Nicephorus A Laick vain Imaginarian Then Theodote not of an Image tang. Antony Cassimate and John Syngell No Imagemongers, then Methodius Ignatius a pair of Image Spells Then Photius Stephen and Antonicus, Nichlas, and last of all Euthemius. Dalmatia now offers us gospell Glory. At Jadere Donatus the word Displayes. Methodius and Cyrill are in story Polanian, and Sclavan Churches praise Who did them gather, and made Gospell blaze. Methodius the Vandall Letters first Invented, then the Scriptures did translate, Into th'slavonian Tongue, and did off burst, The Latine Service. Hence comes popish hate. Whence he at Rome his deed did vindicate. Alledging from the Psalms that Ev'ry Tongue Should praise the Lord: and so did Cyrill too. The Pope hence grants this to the Sclaves alone He to Dalmatia, and Illyrick goe Did, and perswadeth them the like to doe. But seing his Moravians and Sclaves Not pleasd in leaving the Bavarian wayes Who used Latine Service out he waves Into Bavaria with Gospell phrase Dehorts from Latine Service in his dayes. And all God worship in their own Tongue do To Edify the Church as formerly Before the dayes of Charles the Greate, but lo The Popish Brats make Kings upon him fly. Hence going home at Juli'ment did die. Oswald was Bishop of Illyricum Of Norice, and Pannonia ordain'd A truer Trojan to the popish Drum. How far in these the Gospell glory train'd We little know nor know we how restrain'd. GERMAN Light. Germany blossoms now when others droop. Bavaria at Salburge did enjoy Adolram, Leopram, and Baldram's fruite, But wheather sweet, or soure we cannot spy But little of them, but their times look wry. Adelwin, Batarick, and Amberick At Regnsburge bishops were, but of what hew? Tuto obtains Ratispon's bishoprick, At Bathave Angelmar, and Bithing grew At Frising Hallo: yea and Waldo too. In Swevland at Augusta Hanto ruld. Then Hulderick a man of worthy fame, Who did rebuke the Pope and him well schoold Who doth by Marrage hindering, mentain Doctrine of Divells Paul Confirms the Same. At Ments Otgary rose with learned rayes. And Baban after him more learnd and sound, Though both staind with great blotches of the dayes. Luid'bert is said with piety to abound All other I pass ore that here are found. At Worms are Bernard, Rotald, Theotel. Arnoat Herboole, at Wirtziburge Rudolph: at Basil Haido bears the bell. At Constance Solomon who wants a purge In many things his learning wants a scourge. At Colen Gunther rose who did avow The Pope of Rome was Antichrist most vile. In Holland Hiero of England now Did preach at Norwick in a gospell style And him the Pope did of his life beguile. Twelve rose at Verd in Westphaly but all Were of a Romish Cut, at Badeborn there Five other Such, at Mimegard four Call, And five at Osnaburge, at Minden were But two. At Hildesheim five filld the Chair. At Halberstade were six, the third of which A man of fame more sound in doctrine was Than many others. And at Hambrough sits Five more whereof Ansgary out did pass Preacht to the Sweds and Danes with Christ the Mass. Now Germany farewell, the other day There was but little room in thee my Pen Obtaind; though now there's Stable much and hay That makes but little praises rise now when Ive come to gloss upon thy preaching men. Frances Lights. At Lions Hamule in the Hebrew learnd: At Arles one John and Rotland bishops were. At Lexovy Frecalph who oft ore turnd The Scripture, and Explaind it very cleare Whose pious life and doctrine led them there. Senona had learnd Anseg is Rome's ape And Eberhard; Rhemes Turpin did enjoy. Wolfery, Hinemar learnd, and Fulck sad State. At Aurenge Th'odulph, Jonas out did fly. At Tulla Arnulph full of Piety. Halidgary was at Camera set. And Hincomar at Laudune, Hadebert At Sylvanect. Adalbert did they get Now at Morina, there they doctrine part But how we know not. Yet their times were dark. Biturica had six. Frotare the fourth, Seems to withstand Romes pride. And Jesse, who Was sixt, the Pope likt not, hence some good growth. Leody five possesst. Odilbald to Them of Trajecta out his doctrine show. Remigius at Antisiodore did shine. At Car nota Altergery arose, At Paris Herchinrad, and Gozzolme, At Mets Drogo great Charles his bastard flows Whom Lothair sent to Rome the Pope to nose. He with an Army came to Rome reprooves The Pope calld, Swines face for his treachery. Him, Senat, and the Roman poeple moves. And forcd them to an oath of fealty. And Rutber after him did Mets Supply. Trevers had five, whose third brave Thetgand was. The Pope exchurcht him, he in's letter Stiles The Pope too Antichrist, him damns, did pass And's Excommunication on him quiles. Th'Ipsissim Whore of Babylon assoiles. Thou playst the Woolfe, said he, in Shephards weeds. Thou shewst thyselfe the Pagan Jove in facts. Thou Servant, Stylst thyself of Servants seeds. But lord of Lords thou shewst thyselfe whose acts Are Quicquid libet licet Painted Shack. We who are scattered ore the world abide The City of our God. Rome's Babylon Described by the Sacred Prophets tribe. As up into the heaven high ore grown. Usurping of the God heads proper throne. That beasts she is eternall, erreth not, Nor Can once Erre. This Witniss for his pains Was banisht to the Sabines where he got, With Gunther and as Stranger life mentains Who by the Papists murdering hands are slain. Farewell poore Spain: thou com'st not in th's rowle. And Italy I leave out. Ireland And Scotland are not heare. And Englands scrowle Yields Assery of Shirburn, Thetwolfe and Swithin, Dumbert and Dunwolph winton man'd. At Wister Verefride none of the best, Gildas a monk and very fabulous John Erigen a learned man invest And slain at Malmsbury times perilous But Valafrid was very vertuous. These gleaning further take at Taurine shone Italy Claudius a Spaniard bright Syncere in Faith Romes Errours overgrown Images Relicks, Penance Pride did smite And preached to his people gospell light Berthram a Priest in France shone brighter far In Doctrine of the Sacrament in Chiefe. Than many other, who seem as a Star And Corbery Abbat Pascase whose Reliefe About the Same proud Fredwards Right reliefe. But to Conclude these Candles named here, Did give at best a very smoaky flame. I doubt not but the glory was more Cleare Which in this day in ev'ry Realm out came Adornd with grace 'mongst those of lower Name. Whose fame was not espi'de by writers pens, Nor meddled with, as in too low a Sphere. And yet more high than what a dim eye kens Ditcht up with smoake that poethers ev'ry where. For lofty Egles catch not Flies. So here. The Glory of Divine Patience. From Graces Glory now I pass, and Come With sorrow in my heart, and beate the drum In Patience her large continent to finde The Scutchons of her Glory here Enshrinde Up in her Harauldry, by Hands whose die Is Pride, Contention, and Apostasy. 1. Pride. Pride Blossoms, turrits up its Cocks Come high Balconies prelates nests above the Skie. Doth set the Mitre higher than the Crown. A Paultry Clarke above a Kings renown. My Urinall will certainly Discry The Popes of Rome Sick of this tympany. Cock bells of Pride do flowt their livers, Spot And Swell them with red water, and the rot. In the Reigns of the Pope Emperored Kings of France. as in the Reign of Lewis who began 815. 817Stephen the fourth puts up, and he first treds His Chaire with pride, Strode ore King Lewis head: Who ought by Adrian's and Leo's grant Elect the Pope: but he him to Supplant The people bribes into the Chair he slips Without his knowledge thus his heels he trips. The glory of the World he gapes to Catch At Rhemes, the Head of Lewis he did thatch With the Imperiall Diadem, also Hirmingard Emperesses. And to show, Imperiall glorys are the Popedoms drops He brings their Crowns to Rome, oh Subtill fox! But feas their Purses, home a Cross is born To Peter, Silver, Gold and Gems did't dorn. Saint Barbary, and Helin did up deck With pretious Garments, Golden things in't set. As golden Crosses, Cups and Platters, which Death did in's seventh month him therefrom twitch. 817Paschal the Clergy, and the People Choose And from Saint Stephen's Sty of louts unmews And popify, Lewis not privy to't. A mock Elector: must not have a vote. This Lewis Stomachs, calls it Pacta breach And wounding's Majesty. Hence would him teach A better manners, but the Crafty fox The angry Emperour so smootly Coaks That all is pardond. Yet Theodore And Leo who th'Emperiall Right up bore Did lose their Eyes and Lives by Cuthroats who His Holiness had orderd to do so. And doth the murderers absolve, but Cries The slain are Slain for wounding Majesty. He Crownd Lothair. Did Monks in Jayle up lay That Rabene's Letter brought out threatenings bray To Excommunicat learnd Raban, wise. With Silver Gold and Pictures Idolize He did a little while, till death's grim mall, Beate on his panniers, made his jaws to fall. 824Then Eugeny the Second takes a Pill Of Popedom, that did work his doctors Will. When Michael th'Eastern Emperor did send Ambassadors entreating him to lend His help to give firm Scripture proofe that should Confirm this Image worship if he could. He sent without an answer them back, save That Michael arrogant was like a knave. But down ? by a Death not dry, Some think because he dealt Seditiously Against the French Lothair did Constitute Italian Judges right to Execute. 827Then Valentine succeeds for fourty dayes Then Hungry Death his Latter groath did graze. Gregry the fourth is Calld, but will not be Without the Emperours leave, take this degree. He raisd New Holidayes: his All Saints brings From its November Calends to May'es Springs. On France, and Germany it crouds and they Now keep it do the thirteenth day of May. Makes Ansgary Hamboroughs Bishop, who Most o're all Northern Churches Romes Cock crow. The flame tween Lewis and his Sons he blows. First joyn'd he with the Sons: then out he goes, To Lewis, who him chid, to whom he said I came for peace. And back he went and made This ly, He Excommunicated had 732This Lewis, hence Priests Captain, all like mad Unto the Sons, who did their father take Who when he'd all got back did them forsake. Who in his Superstition, and Pride high Kickt up his heels How like you, Sir, to dy? Under Charles 2d who began 841. 844Hogsface roots in Saints Peters Patrimony. Did strap Johns sides who lept at it so stony. And Crept without imperiall liking in't, Did out his name (Hogsface) by Sergius din't. He would not yield the Romans faith, and Oath To keep With Lothairs Son, calld Lewis: growth So proud will have invested in his hande The Powre of making Kings and Supremes stand. King Lothair Crowns Lewis his Son designs 846King of the Longbards, but his day declines[.] Leo the fourth, or fift some say, up hights 847The Emperour not knowing of the Coits. (Poor Jack a nobody) He as his Siers Worships his Saints, in Silver-Gold attires Esteems the Pope must two Swords at his Side Possess, to Rule the Church and Realm as guide And Sovreign Lord. The Empire was not slack Unto the Greeks again from th'French to back. He made Monk Ethelwolfe too Englands King. For which he raisd in's holy Chair a Spring Of Silver pence from ev'ry house to run Out of his English Realm. Oh! Loving Son. He otherwise than Aquisgrane decreed In Councill held therein, did on proceed His Papall Cross stuck with rich Gems made goe Before him born; and people Kiss his toe. But all his Glory fats the Porkit rich. He's not made brawn, for death: but Bacon flitch. 854Good morrow Madam! art thou found at last: A bucksom Worth, Good Pope, the Chair doth grasp. An English Priest with's fraighted Miss to Ments Did go, she there lies in and Pays her rents Into his arms a daughter Gilbert nam'd Who grew up prompt, a Vizzor soon obtaind, Became a Monk in Fulda Monkish sty And other Monk her femall Points did Spy. And so improve his sharp invention till A Monkish Cowl Could not vaile ore their Skill. Arts quickly shew themselves, grow high and quaint Will not be Prisoners to a Truss, or point. Away they pack to Athens Gilbert there Sharp learning gets among the learned quire A smart Disputant rose, but off now falls Her Love, or Husband: none withstand death's Calls: To Rome she goes: an English man appears. In Schools, and Abbies taught: Disputes: up rears A glorious Name. Leo dropt in his den, She by the Common vote of Comen men, And of the Clergy with Imperiall Voice Rose up to Peters Chair and in a trice. As arch a Crack as any of them all Pope John or Joan her Jack, or Jin they Call. Ordains Priests, Deacons: Bishops Consecrates Makes Abbats, and the Mass she Celebrates, Administers the Sacraments also Altars, and Temples Consecrateth too Doth in a solemn Way Lothair the Son Of Lewis hid, in Prumy Abby run, 856Crowns king: And gifts of Englands King obtains Holds out the foot for men to kiss. Sustains The Fatherhood of Popedom, grew with Child Which broke its bounds, and out did lash though Spoild, While solemnly Processioning Jack-Jin From th'Vatican, to th'Lateran was in Twixt Nero's gay Coloss, and Clements Fawn. Her Soul gusts out even with her Egg and Spawn. 857And in her groaning place a Marble Cross Erected is to shun bad mem'ries loss. Also the Pope nere through this street doth tread To th'Lateran, where pope John was brought to bed. What shall be said hereto? doth Hic or Haec Best Suit your Holiness. And it best deck? Good Father Pope resolve it if you can Shall we your Father-hood call dad or Mam? Though Greeks make use of onely genders three The Latines can dispense with more wee see. The Common Genders necessary grow Unto the Pope, who genders much, although His Chastity pretends much other wise. The Epicene is proper to his Sise. He vari'd must now as his Eagle, bee Haec Aquila an Eagle He or Shee. The Doubtfull now grows needfull, they would have The Honourablest gender in their Knave. Cocks are not surely known by Combs, Spurs, Crows The Taile a Surer note of Gender shows. 857The next Bird Benit tersh, doth when first Caught Abide an Epicene, wherefore there's brought A Porphyry Chaire, a Conning Stoole where he Must by the youngest Deacon Conned bee. Who finding of the bird with Egg doth sound Out Habet Habet, to the Cockerills round. The sex thus found Benit is Chairman made He Churches built to Saints and them enlaid With Costly things, his worshipt also stems Tended with Silver, Gold, and Pretious Gems. Decrees the Collect Dirige, be red Yet first of all the Popes, even for the Dead. And twelve years penance for Curst Parricide Hee Earthly Princes scornd, was Popifide Without Imperiall leave, and justles out One Anastase, Lewis design'd, so stout, That Lewis made him Jayle bird ly, and's place He gave to Surrogated Anastase, Who was by Leo Excommunicate And made the object whom the people hate, Hence Benit to King Lewis reconcild Is in'd again. And th'other prison-spoild He Sweld in pride is worshipt Idol like 859The people kiss his toe. Death him doth strike[.] Then Nicholas is Chose King Lewis there And is invested too: did Altars reare And Churches too to Saints and in them Stows Vests, Vails, Gold Silver things, and Curious shows Of Reliques, Masses, Gemmed Ornaments, Priests Wedded damms, and Latine Service, sents Of Hell, Commands all Churches to attend, Except Polone and Bulgar. doth ascend Above Imperiall Might, excludeth Kings From Synods, save where Faiths sweet doctrine springs. Will have the Pope all Lawless, judgd of none. And like to God almighty be alone. Lewis him meeting doth unmount and led His horse into the tent, while rode this head. Did harass Lothair, who had put away Thietberg his Strumpet wife, took Waldrada Into his bed. Did threash them both away And mews him in a Monkish hive to stay Not hearing of the Case, no right nor reason Could make him hear both parties. Oh what treason. Gunthare, and Thetgand in a Counsill calld At Metz approving the Divorce are halld Unheard, and Excommunicated and Deposd, oppresst and smootherd by his hand. But Death draws on, and tabers on his doore 868And down he falls. Good Sir, go pay your Scoare. The Seate to Adrian the Second came Who took without th'Imperiall leave the Same. The Church begun by Nicholas he much Adornd with various Pictures: and he Such As in a book subscribd that they did own. The Pope of Rome all Churches heads alone, Unto Constantinople, Synod would Admit: permits no laick Prince up hold, Nor King nor Emperour whoere he be An hand in choosing Bishops, (Good Decree) That Patriarchates to themselves inclose. King Lothair came to Rome himselfe to clear From Crimes against him that objected were To whom he so the Supper gave that hee Soon after his departing's made a fee For Death, and all his nobles that attend Him did, did in that year come to their end[.] Lampert Duke of Spoleto he did Spoile Ands Dukdom to himselfe Subdue and Soile. Alphred the King of England he adopts His Son, and Crowns him, brings him to his Chops. But after all his pride a morsell he 872Unto the Chops of Death is made to bee. 885John None doth clap his bum in Peters Chaire Like to his Predicessors, of them's the Heir. Did King it o're the Churches and doth slight Th'Authority of Princes, doth up height Monks Priest, and goods that to the Church belong Above all Civill Power, be't right or Wrong. Rides over Princes heads. And Charles the Balld By Silver hifts he Emperour enstalld. Hee did displease the Romans, wherefore they His Holiness did in the prison lay. Out of their pound he Slips, to France he go'th And Lewis Balb Crown King of France he doth. And Charles the Gross King of the German Men Makes Emperour with Imperiall Diadem. And having run his race he did repare Unto his Fathers as their rightfull heire[.] In Lewis the 3d's Reigh begining Ano. Dni. 881. 887Martin the third doth on the Beast back jump. And witcheries some Call his horse block-stump. A Chip he of the Old block was disolves Formosus of his Oath who then resolves No more to Come to Rome, nor undertake A Clergy Office, and much of him makes. But breathing time is short he doth his line To his Successor speedily resigne. In Charles 3d time begining 886. 887Agapitus then broke his Shell and peeps An nother bird still of like feather keeps. A little while in't, then falls in Deaths Maw. 889Then Adrian the third is hatcht, Cries Caugh. He with the Senate, and the Citizen, Decrees that hence th'Imperiall Diadem Shall not be troubled with Electing Popes But freedom yields the Folk and Clergie's Votes. Good night good Emperours, we take our leave Of your Electing Popes. Your hands off heave From our high Miters: for our Steeples Stand Above your Crowns, Towers, Turrits or Commands. In Odo's Reign begining 891 890But Death him Crops: Basil did him Succeed 895But how we se not: yet a Popish weed. And then rose Stephen Quintus all enguild In Superst[it]ion, he first Statutes boild Up of the Church of Rome, till necessary For all Unto Salvation, (Sir be wary.) And though he sits like God in his esteem Death breaths upon him, he's no longer seen. Formosus then came in, a tumult which Rusht in the Church: and off their hands did twitch That were ordaining Sergius and made 895Them on Formosus forthwith to be laid. Who provd as ranck as any of the Crew Then Boniface twenty Six dayes up grew But by a Cup of poison fell perhaps. And then on Stephen Sext the Miter flaps, Who calls a Synod and their Statutes nulls. His buri'd Corps some from his grave out pulls Strip of the Papall Robes, in laicks vest And him with laiks bury, yet's molest, For two years hence he is tooke up; and they Cut off two fingers, he was wont to lay Upon the heads of such he Consecrates And into Tyber's Cast. Fish are Popes mates[.] Romanus him succeeds a three months bird. Then Theodore in't ninteen dayes just flurd. What strange Confusion's here? What shapes of pride? Stephen, and this Formosus at once Slide Into the Chair which 'fore the Cushion they Desert, four more their bums upon it lay. Its well perfumd I doubt not, all on't sit Did in this Century or Pens do slip, But what a Crew of Lucifers here trod Their Dam, Soaring above the Stars of God. But all the while Patience wares Glories blush To See such towring Pride Such and so flush. And other rich Examples out might stare Of Haughtiness to shew beyond Compare The glorious Robes Patience hath got upon her, But these Sufficient are to shew her Honour. Contentions under the Reigns of the Emperour East as Nicephorus/West a Charles Mag from 803/800 Contentions now of Various Shapes, and Hews Lift up their Turcky Faces[,] Coler Spews It's Gall in Patience's Face it to defile Which make its beauty more effulgent smile. When Irenee the Emperess did by The second Nicene Counsill Ratify Vile Image worship, and so squar'd with Rome A smiling peace with East and West Church soon Ensu'de which was but broken winded Stuff. For Constantine by Franckford Counsill Chuff, Finding the same by Law Divine Condemn'd By other Godly Doctors who Contemn'd Such Idoll Stuff, struck down Nicene Decrees Irenee hence stroyes Constantine. Strange Fees. Yet when Nicepherus arose he brake Off Image Worship and Rome's pride did hate. Plato, who saw Tarase approve the Case Of Constantine who did 'gainst right imbrace The Harlot Theodate, while's wife Surviv'd, With drew Communion. Hence broiles sprung, thriv'd, And greaten'd much. Some did for Plato stand, Some for Tarase, whom dead they out of hand Chase soon Nicephorus the Secretary A Laick for their Patriarch: they vary. Plato, and Theodore oppose the Same. Nicephorus Calls a Synod on the flame Who wards the Emperour for to Expell Plato and's Party from their town and Cell. The which he did not onely, but thereto Doth adde this inch, did them in prison throw. Under the Eastern/Western Emperour Michael 812/Charles Mag Michael the Emperour Proclaims it by Nicepherus the Patriarch and his fry It Capitall to be a Manichee Paulitian, or Attingan, others plea, Priests may not set Capitall Punishment On Sinners but of such ? Hence they at Daggers draw, fight Pro, and Con, And such like Scuffles rose up many an one. Under Lewis the Pious West/Leo 5 the East 815/814 Pope Leo Dead, his foes do broach new broils. But Stephen Quart to quench the firey toiles Entreates King Lewis those for Leo's Sake Charles banisht, might return, so th'fire did Make. But Stephen dead, the folk and Clergy bigg With things Seditious Paschall up did rig And Popefy. Lewis not privy to't Then Lea slay and Theodore, of note Who Lothair's right mentain'd. But Paschal purgd Himselfe by Oath, lest for the fact he's Scourg'd. Constantinoples Leo Emperour Did Image worship by good Law abhor. Hence Nicephor did with his Image Crew By Pens, and Preaching gall upon him Spew. But he observing all their Rhetorick Want Scripture force Nicephorus did kick Into Exile who su'de to Michael Balb To have him, and his Image work recalld. But all in vain. More Image Stir was made By Methody, and Euthymy till paid Well for the Same. This mischiefe also flames Till Stripes it damps, when the Imperiall Rains Were by Theophilus mentain'd, which Strife Raisd up for Images by Michaels wife. Under Lewis 2d/Lewis 3d West Emperour 879/881 Basilius East Emperour. 866. Ignatius Byzants Patriarch for bad Michael the Emperour the Supper. Sad. Who had his wife causlessly put away And usd his Sons Wife. Hence began the fray. His Stomach Swells: his gall now overflows. Ignatius he in Banishment bestows. Whom Romes base Legats did in Synod damn. With all his mates. Pope Nick here at Cryes ham, Rescinds his Legats Acts, illegall calls Ignatius Exile. Photius acts down halls. Photius forbids Basil the Sacrament For Slaying Michael, he in discontent A Synod gets, who him did charge because Anothers Seat Envades he 'gainst good Laws. Hence out Packs Photius. In comes once again Ignatius in the Patriarchate main. Rome and Ravenna to't go tooth and naile But John's nose thrust is under th'Popes Sweet taile[.] Bulgary once Christian, all possesst By Scythians fell to Pagan rites, yet blesst With a Conversion to the Faith, a flame Twixt East and West Popes brake out for the Same. Rome saith they're mine, I did them teachers send. New Rome saith nay, they're mine they do attend My Ceremonies, and indeed they come And to the Eastern Empire do belong. A Synod at Constantinople shines To judge the Right, which nothing yet defines. The Bulgars send to Rome for Ministers. Leopard, Dominick, and Sylvester Are sent, but quickly finding how they're polld Thereby, their Roman Priests they out, and rowld Themselves upon the Greeks: Hence quarrells fly Betwixt the Greeke, and Latine Churches high. Under Charles the bald/Odo, or Eudes West Emperour 886/891 Leo the Sixt East 886 Now some mentain Christs Body and his Blood Under no Figure in his Supper Scud. Others deny it. Charles the Bald therefore Did Bertrams Definition of't implore, Who thus defines we with no bodies Eyes Se not Christs Body nor his blood to rise. Yet with our Mouth in very truth do eate That Body, that was Crucifide for meate. And drinck that blood shed on the Cross for us. The words of Christ defines the matter thus. Hincmar of Laudune granted Charles the Bald, Some Goods the Church did own, and never calld For leave of others: that Charles might them sign. Sorry hereat, he crav'd them back again. Which when he rendred not forth with, a flame Of Excommunication from him fell, Hincmar of Rhemes Archbishop now did Swell. A Synod held at Worms did disallow This Excommunication. Wherefore now He to the Pope appeals, the Synod then And Charles did joyntly his appeale condemn. And Cite an Africk Canon that strife shall Be judgd in Province where it Sprung up all. He quickly after Chargd his Priests to cease Their Ministeriall function. Farewell Peace. Hincmar of Rhemes pronounceth that decree All over stufft with wickedness to bee. The Pope now grins at Hincmar, cause he did Laudune's appeale unto the Pope forbid And cause he did not at the Popes Command Laudune and other three ? Cause Charles the Bald he Excommunicates Not, who the Realm of Lothair had of late. And cause he did not anathematize Nortman that Laudune Churchgoods made his prize. Hincmar of Rhenes replies, it is not so He ne'er forbad th' appeale, nor them to do. That he without the King could not depart Much less send others out of th'realm, poore heart! That Charles by Covenant did reign. And that The Pears did count it news and a Strange spat That Popes assume unto themselves to judge De jure thus of Kingdoms. And grow budge. He cannot be a Bishop, and a King He with his Spirituall Care Content should Spring. And for the last, it was a Papall Ly. Nortman did not on Churches matters fly. The Bishop gave the King them, he them him. Yet after part was given by the King Unto the Church: and part the Bishop gave To Nortmans Son. Thus he displaid the Knave[.] When Charles the Bald Hincmars Appeale delayd Pope Adrians Letters did the King upbraid Of Tyranny Perfidious Perjury. Rebuking him, because not patiently He bore the Popish lies, and Chastisments. And with such Phrases unto him, he vents We Will, and Charge by our Apostolick Power Hincmar himselfe Bishop of Laudune's tower, Sir, with your leave advanc'd, Come Speedily To th' Sacred Threasholds, and our Clemency. Who being Come, let likewise here appeare His brisk Accuser who by no law cleare May be refusd. Then in our presence soon, And Synod Conclave of the See of Rome. His Cause by prudent triall fand, and searcht Without all juggling, as God display'd, And Sacred Cannons by God Spirit made. Charles in greate indignation tooke this thing, And tells him 'twas unseemly Popes should fling Such railing letters at him, who Sustaind Bright Majesty, did nothing rightly blam'de, Was never yet accused lawfully Of any Crime, nor was Convicted by The Bishops judgment. And goes on and saith Seing thy Predicessours better Faith Have shew'd, than t'write unto the Kings of France Such foppish, and Imperious Letters dance And sharply Chides him, that without all proofe He Charg'd him with such crimes, and also shew'th He studious was to Stab and not to Cure Contrary to a Pastors Office sure. He did deny that hee impatiently Commands, and true Correction Gods word ply, Sustaind: retorts this Check upon himselfe As guilty of this Fault, a peevish Elfe. He also did his Proud Command oppose: And proves he 'gainst his Predicessours goes, And Gods own Word: which doth forbid to set, A Grove in's Temple, that is thus, to get The Worlds black Picture in his Church: which hold The Light of Simplicity to all men should. He saith its 'gainst his Law and Power to Crow, Ore Kings who punish Sins, to Rome men t'throw. And also this he prooves, contrary springs Unto the Law and Custom of French Kings. And on he goes, and to be briefe doth say, I'le come to Rome and Hincmar's Charge display Even when I list; and did forbid that hee Do any more such things write to him: see, Or to his Bishops of his Pears, or things Which they may piously reject as Sins. Charles also Chode Ravenna's Priests, because Of Monks made priests they changd against their Laws, Their monkish Weeds into Priests Robes: whereby They Discord hatch, are stain'd with perjury. They did reply hereto Celestine, and Pope Leo too Consented Monks should stand, By Doctrine, Life, and Purity of Minde. And not by Habit, Vest, or Cloaths, defin'd Their Ancestors, yea and the Church of Rome Attended this. And none did at them fume. Leo the Eastern Emperour doth wed A fourth Wife. Which disturbe the Patriarch's head. He with's Church Keyes fights 'gainsts Leo's Sword. Did Censure him, who hence asserts, Gods word Forbids not any a fourth marriage so When Nick would not absolve him, he must go Into Exile; soon after, Lawe defines Any wed might twice, thrice or full foure times And thus things, gangrene-like, ore Spreading all This Century Patience's tears down fall. Persecutions Contentious Fire thus burning of the Shins Of Gospellers, I leape from; yet do sindge My feathers in those flames wherein they rost The Gospell flesh in Persecutions Coast, Gotrick the Dan[i]sh King an Hater keen Of Christian Faith endeavers in sharp spleen By Guile, Threats, Cruilty to terrify The Saxons from the Faith: and Pastors Stroy. And Bishop Salvy, Winigard the Steward 801Did put to Death: The Huns and Avars ur'de To mischiefe, many pious persons slay. The Sclave, Bohemians too attend such play. The Hillions beyond the Abbis and The Britons up their Gentilism fand And new Destructions do devise to fling On Christians, till Charles did destroy their wing. The Saracens who wast Galatia And Cappadoce, and Cyprus, leavell lay 804Their Churches; and the People Captivate A Temple build to Mahomet in State. Mich'el the Eastern Prince in rage did fly On Nicholas, and's Mate who did decry The worshipping of Images and made Nick to recant: but when his mate delai'd He cut his tongue out: of which pain he di'de. And rag'd 'gainst Such as down such worship cri'de. Leo the Eastern Prince when better taught Out of Gods word all image worship brought To be cast down, its patriots expelld: Mich'el the Stutterer whom some Peeres held In much esteem flew on him as he sat Singing of Holy Songs in's Chappell, hat 821Him down, cut off his Head and hands and drew His Trunck about the Horse Circk in base hew. His Sons did geld them exild: in Zeale To image worship, thus the Wreath did Steale. When Friderick Traject's Bishop gave rebuke To Lewis King who th' Daughter of the Duke Of Bavare, his own Kin had married That if the King did not dismiss that bed He would him Excommunicate and rightly By the Authority of the Almighty, And quickly after by the Emperess He deaths Dark region sent is to possess. Bardas in th' East his wife did put away And with his Sons wifes companies doth stay Ignatius hence him Excommunicates. And other Ministers approove 't. He hates And take the Bishop, and imprison'd in A Sepulcher, and after banisht him. The Normans Persecute the Frisers, Gauls, And Francks, and up 'gain Ethnick worship hall. At Nantz the Bishop while baptizing they With other Christians on the Sabbath slay. The Danes do burn down Hamburgh Church and drive Ansgare with Priests and Pupills from their hive. Rernigius bishop of Antisiodore The Sorrows of these times did thus deplore There's Persecutions raisd by Pagans rage [Bottom of page worn away] ? sage. The Pagan Kings, and Persecuters guisd Baptized are, the Divell's not baptiz'd. Who Secretly in Secret ones doth rage 882That is, in wicked Christians of the age. The French Kings jarring many godly flew The Danes and Normans Lotharingy through And France, for heathen Worship did in ire Churches, and Christians treate with Sword and fire. The Castle at Saint Lot, Surrendred they 895Constance's Bishop, and the People Slay. They make incursion far as Worms, and still Mentz's Bishop Sunderold and many kill. Cities, and Citizens, Bishops and flock Brave Churches and believers troop down knock. And burnt together; and Moravians Stroy, all save one Church of th' Hungarians. And while these Cruelties thus welt in blood Patience her bleeding teares down trickling Skud. Contentions thus tareing her garments by Their thorny prickles doth her glorify. Patience Exercised under Apostasy. And now we pass unto the Wainscoat Pews Of Rancke Apostasy, which doth abuse Rich Patience, till her Girdle all like gold For glory shineth in each Sparkling fold. And as I take the sent the Ranckest fume Of Arch Apostates, is the Reech of Rome. Whose pot is wallopping untill its Scum Runs in the fire, foists of each Popes Sweet bum. That do perfume the aire breizd ore his Sea Some hold their nose thereat, come out, away Others Calld Hereticks do beare this brand The Papists gave them 'cause they them withstand. Such was Theoda who professt to have Celestiall Visions, Doomes day out she gave Should be that very yeare, wherefore she's ti'de Unto a Whip stock scourg'd because she li'de In Beiga Godescalk up sprang who sung The Father God greater than God the Son That by necessity of Providence Some must in Hell, some in Heaven commence. In Phrygia, Atingans, Paulicians too Up Sprang a Sort of Manichees up grew. King Chilperick was Arianisd also Mich'el the balb a Saducee did grow. But Image mongery whose Spirits boild In Romes fat Pottage Pot all Churches oyld. Whose fopperies that Patience Sighs to see. Unto the Shine of Truth reserved bee. But this Apostasy doth mostly range In Superstitions fields Wherefore her Grange I come an Hunting in: and lusty Pusses Do form herein: which up my hunter rushes. Church Consecrations now they make oh Shame And do it in the trinity's blesst name, And put their Names upon them thus, Saint Claries Saint Peters, or Saint Saviours: or Saint Maries. They Consecrate their Altars, and them Soile Mongst royall Gifts with Consecrating Oyle Their Church accomplishments are Altar-Tables, Pillars, and Pulpits, Pictures, Missalls-Fables. Lattasses, Crosses, Candles, Candlesticks Lanthorns and Censars Frankincense smoak thick. Asyles, and Relicks, Clocks, and Hourglasses Bells, Organs, Priestly Robes with various dashes Hood, Tunicks, Circingles, Mantle withall Dalmatick, Stole Shooes Surplice and Pall. Were not these Superstitious all these flaws Would be but freckles in th' Apostate Cause. We higher mount: when any one in Zeale Conferd a dowry on the church this peale With hand on Altar out he rings and said To God I give and vow all things convay'd Here in this Scrowle for pardon of my Sins And of my Parents, Childrens too: for things That he would have them make attonement for What ere to Serve in Sacrificing war. For Solemn Masses, Prayers, and Candle-lights Alms for the Poor and Clergy: and Church rites And who so ever shall them steale away Let him Sustain a Sacralegious pay: And Alstan Sherburns Bishop did ordain On Ev'ry Wednsday fifty Psalms-song plain Be Sung in ev'ry Church and prayers be read Both for the Living King, and for the Dead. And in baptizings Raban Maurus thus The Sign of th' Cross in Heart, and Forehead push. Then give him Holy Salt to Kill his Worms Of Sins, then fell with Exorcism-Spurns The Evill One. Then Spittle put into His Ears, and nosthrills, them open so. Then noint his bosom with your holy Oyle And tween his Shoulders noint the Div'le so foile. Then bless the Font, and there baptize thou him In th' name of holy trinity, Strang thing. Church Keyes oft errd, the harmless locking out Rabanus deemd these Keyes should have about With Such as Mad dogs liver gave to cure Such as were bitten by a mad dog sore. The Holy Supper's made a Stage play Shew Of Maumatrey by Massifying Crew[.] Pope Adrian the Second did it ply Like bitter Water that of jealosy, Upon King Lothair whom he thus bespake With Bread, and Blood in's hand now to partake If thou art cleare from all Adultery, And firmly fixt in mind never to ly More With Waldrad thy Concubine dismisst, Approach, and take this Feast: (Strike hard good fist) But if thy Conscience Check thee and thou wilt Return unto thy Wallowing in guilt Presume not to receive lest thou it do Unto thy Dread Damnation, and thy Woe. Which when receivd the King returning di'de Then at Placentia: and his Pears did slide Into their Tombes before the yeare was done. Doubtless into this Cup much poyson run. In imitating which, a Synod held At Worms ordaind that Secret Crimes be queld, That the Suspected Friers if innocent Should purge themselves upon the Sacrament. Constantinople's Emperour the Son Of Theodora Michal bred up Some Vile youngsters who in priestly Dress do fain To offer up the Host unbloody slain. In their Assembly Micha'l was one When they unto this Horrid Sport then shown, In golden Cups Stuck with rich Gems, did mix Mustard with Vinegar, and gave in tricks. And some through folly did instead of Wine Use Water, most did wine and water joyne. Some gave to Children, and Bystanders there The Consecrated Host, Christ Body Cheere. Raban Condemns the Eating Flesh in Lent: A Priest that eat then in despare was shent. They Worship Crosses with Orations, prayers Yea dead mens bones and Relicks (Holy wares). Persons possesst, in Sacred places lay By Dead Saints, thus to chase the Fiend away. To Fire, or Water Ordial they go Enchaind to tell if innocent, or no. They clarkify the Sons of Kings, you'l find Now Charloman a Deacon 'gainst his minde. Basil the Emperour his youngest Son And Drogo Lewis his, are of this Sum. Ignatius too Son of Michael is plac'de Constantinoples Bishop all begrac'de. But these fat Clericks never fed the flock But for the Golden Fleece they tend the lock. Now Bartram, and Paschase the Seeds do sow Of Transsubstantiation, which up grow. But Romes Fat Bishop overjets the rest, In tyranny and Supers[ti]tion drest. But as these things did Patience exercise So also did those Lying Prodagies. Of such a die as these my pen recites. Numeneus King of the Britons hights On horsback saw Bishop Maurilio Stand by him looking Crabbidly him to Saying thou Cruell Roague desist to stroy Gods Church; and Cudgeld him hence by, and by He went away thus strapt, was carri'd home, And quickly left his kingdom for his Tomb. Constantine, Leo's Son when drunk, they say Did at great Greg'ry's Statue for eyes pray And soon a Demon in his Sleep him bid To rise, and read My Jesus, which he did, Which when he had, his voice returnd again And in the Church he red Distinct, and plain. When Manuel lay at the point of Death Him Monks did promise life would he give breath To image worship which when he had done His health immediatly did to him run. A Servant Seven years dumb lay sleeping by A Pillar in Saint Benite while the fry Chaunt praise to God: Saint Benit came and said Rise, Spit thrice on the ground Which he assaid, And having done the gift of Speech he gain'd If Writers lies have not their papers staind. When Martins Relicks were translated ore For fear of Normans, to Altisiodore, The Monks Consult whether that Church shall be Calld Martins, or Libories. They agree, To set a Leper in their presence and By prayes to try the vertues of Each hand. Which done an Oracle from Martins Arke Salutes him thus I now do cleanse one part Of thy sad body, and the other do My brother Libory let fall unto. Wherefore he turnd to Libory the other And on the other side did health recover. Cuthbert reveald in Dream to Alfred King Of England Exild, and his Mothers wing The Lord me sends to thee with joyous news England's Sins punishments are ore. She views Mercie upon her Saints, thou thus Exild Shalt to thy Throne in glory soon be quoild. And for a Sign hereof, thy Fishers shall Come with great Store of fish today took all. Which is a wonder seing no such thing Is hoped for in frozen Streams to spring. But when this happiness doth with thee stay Me that thee freed and told thee minde I pray. He and his Mother both this Vision saw And rising up fell peeling of this Straw. And in the Fishers came with fish good Store This seems a Monkish ly, whereof there's more. They say the Citizens of Chartres hung The Virgin Marys Gown out, which there run From Byzant, by the means of Charles the Balld, Upon the Wall, a Banner, which then mauld Rollo the Dane and's Army, smote them blinde Perchance the Blinding Proverb hence took winde. When Colen Church was Consecrated there, At night, the Cries of Evill Spirits reare, Lamenting that they now were drove away Out of their Seats. How doth the Spirit play. Lewis his fathers Ghost did to him pear Adjuring by the Trinity to Steere Even all his Skill deliverance to bring Him out of all those torments he was in. That he at length might have Eternall rest. Wherefore the Son larg Dowries doth invest Monasteries withall that they with mass Might gain his Father from his torments, pass. When Lothairs Soul did from him Steale away. Angells and Demons for it fight: then pray The Monks, and thereby lend their helping hand Unto the Angells, who then th'Demons bangd, And so the booty takes, the Soule obtains Or else this bout was in the monks ranck [b]rains[.] Turpin asserts that while he was at Mass Once for the dead, he in a rapture was And spide a troop of Souldiers with a prey To whom he said, What Carry you away: They say, we Carry Marsary to Hell: Mich'el to heaven bears your Minsterill. The Souldier Romarick his horse unto His Cousen gave to sell him, and bestow The money on the poore, when he was dead, But he the horse Sold; kept the pay (base head) The Souldiers Ghost appears, doth thus him treat, I thirty dayes have been in Hell compleat. But now I going up to Paradise Thou shalt go there to day; because through vice Thou gav'st not what I bad thee to the poore. Then Divells caught him, and away him bore. I in Vienna's Church was praying by The Altar, saith Turpin, an Extasy Surprizd me while I sung that Psalm so sweet God is my Helper. And mine eyes soon meet Greate troops of Valy Fiends pass on to go To Lotharingy, after whom though slow Went one like to a tall tall black-a-moore. To whom I said, Whither away? Wherefore He said, to Aquisgrane, we thither stretch, That we the Soul of Charles to hell may fetch. Quoth I, I thee by our Lord Jesu's name Adjure to come to me, tur[n]ing again, The Psalm was hardly sung but by me they Did in like order back return a way I to the last the former catcher pole Spoke thus: What have ye done, at Charles his dole? Saith he, Galacian in his Scales did weigh Such, and so many Stones and Timber gay, Of his Brave Churches that his good works thus Oreweighing's ill, he tooke his Soule from us. He likewise said When Charles did vengeance take Upon the Spaniards for brave Rolands sake (Who murderd was) the Sun, oh lying quill For three dayes Space in heaven then Stood Still. The Priest Peogil at his Mass prostrate Pray'd thus, Almighty Shew me (thy poore Waite) In this great mystery the nature true Of Christs own body present, let me view With bod'ly Eyes, the Beauty of the boy The Virgin bore; and with my hands him try. And while he pray'd, an Angell said arise Up quickly, if thou'lt see Christ with thine Eyes. He's here invest with Corporall attire, The Virgin bore, after thine own desire. He trembling lookt up, and saw upon The Altar th'Fathers Son whom Simeon Took in his Arms, then thus the Angell said Seing it pleasd thee Christ to see displai'd, Whom thou wast wont to Consecrate before, Under the Shape of Bread with words of Store. Now View with Eyes hand with these hands of thine. He then amaizd for joy the Child doth twine His trembling arms about, and joyns his breast Unto Christs breast his Lips, his lips kisst presst. Which done he to the uper end of th'Are The glorious members of Gods Son did bare. With Heavenly food Christs Table thus he filld, Then prayd that all might to their first Shape yield. And so it came to pass, but all this While A bloody Sweat hereat doth Patience moile. Imandus lay Sev'n score and twelve years dead Was found in body whole, Hair on his head, With nailes on's digitalls, his teeth out took Blood poured out: Fy of this monkish fruite. The Earle of Altorff's Lady Irmentrude Chode a poore woman, as a whore, and rude Who had three babes at once, Scourgd by her means Yet Irmantrude though bathing in her gleams Conceivd and fell in travill, twelve forth come, At such a time her Lord was not at home. She fearing of like measure, makes her nurse Eleven of them take and drown (sad Course) In th'Scherky by, She in her apron takes The Innocents: But meets the Earle who spakes What hast thou there? Whelps, quoth she. Let me see Of all love, said he, if they pritty bee Ile save the Same. She with this Check did strike, What will you look on Such base Filthy Sight? He's resolute, will look, and Childrens sees Of Beautious Countences, saith whose are these? She's forc'd to tell the matter. He doth take And puts them out to nurse, bad her not speake A word of't to the Countess. Hence first came The Guelphine House, (that German tongues Whelphs name) Six years turn round, the Earle a feast doth make Invites His and Her kindred all, did take His 'leven Sons neat dresst and them brings to His Ladie t'se whether she did them know. She smelt the matter: on her knees did fall, And begs a pardon: He forgives her all. And in the Village of Altorff did build A Nunnery thereby great thanks to yield. Some take this Story for a monkish ly. If so, Patience is Exercisd hereby. Apostasy by Such Strang lurches gi'n Unto the truth by lying Wonders, Sin And Heresy, doth bring a glorious Shine To Patience for her ornamentall Shrine. Thus having blazd Some Scutchon of her Glory, My pen doth glide unto another Story. The Shire of Justice. Bright Justice now I to thy Coasts do come To pick some Pearles and Stick them all a long Thy glorious Crown untill thy Glory blaze Before their Eyes that deem thee dead these dayes. The Sinfull Empire now thy law doth tax. She's split asunder by thy halbert axe. Unto the Eagles Thracian Head up Springs Another Headed Neck in ? Pope Leo by his Peters Power doth bless 801Greate Charles Crown with Empire Happiness. And in this wound Each lips do ranckle, Chap As justice doth her Corrosives there clap. Under the Reign of Nicephorus 8/Stauratius 1/Michael 2/Leo 1/Charles the Great. 13. In Asia great Scourges shine forth do. Nicephorus in Phrygia out doth go To rout th'Arabians, or the Saracens At Gasson's routed scarce get clear of them In Persia Stirs arise th'Arabian Prince Is busi'd them to Still; Nicephorus since His foile gets up, doth fortify Andrase Ancyram Galatia, and The base Sends out his armies t'harrass now his Foes Which routed are. Aaron now angry grows Three hundred thousand Strong out leaps, Surprize Strong Heracly, The base, Andrase likewise Sydrople, Malatop, Ancyra rounds Yet from the Same after a While rebounds. Necephorus Constrain'd makes peace and brake The Same, wherefore the foes to Cyprus make. Th'Arabian Captain dead in Persia, Mahamet, and Habdallas, brethren play Their Swords then for a Crown, after a while They by agreement do divide the Spoile Habdallas reigns ore Gobda. Mahamet Egypt, and Africa his part doth get. 809In Europe things do Clash. Bulgaria Doth scourge Niceporus. Seditions play. They Choose the Questor a Patrician Arsabire Emperour, a pious man. Who quickly is pluckt down do what he can. While at the River Strymo pay was made Unto the Army, Bulgars them invade At unawars, Pretor, Pears, Souldiers slain Eleven hundred pound of gold is ta'ne And Sardica is took by treachery. His people Sturdy he grew ? The Sixteen talents thirteen hunderd pound Sent Leo the Armenian Pretor, round For's Souldiers pay the Saracens did make A booty to themselves, who did them take. The Emperour against Bulgaria Goes out, reduceth Crunnus, and in way Most cruell slayes their infants: no peace will plight With them, they therefore are Constraind to fight And falling on him unawares, him beate, 8011His head Cut off, Of all his brains the Seate And of his Brain Pan, they a Beere bowle make For Crunnus: Sir how like you Leagues to breake? Staurace the Emperour by Wicked Arte The Empire to his mother strives to impart And sets the Bulgars on the Christians: blindes His Sisters husband Mich'el, quickly findes 811The Empire giving him a tanck: and so To Mich'el Rangabis it soon doth goe. Whom Crunnus greets with tendering peace, but hee Consulting of't his Nobles don't agree. Crunnus Mesembria takes and also wins Brave Adrianople, many Forts do[w]ne flings. 813Mike to Constantinople flies and there Charg'd is of Sloath, became a Monke for feare. And Leo who him Charg'd when Crownd in town: Crunnus was ready soon to Crack his Crown. But all this While the Western Empires Stirs We came not to. The Saracens vile Sirs 807Now wast Sardinia, but are tooke down By Pipin Whom when dead Great Charles did Crown 808Pipins Son Bernhard King of Italy. The Maurs do Centumcell, and Nicy Stroy. In Spain the Franks do Barcinona wast. And Lewis Siegeth Dertose. Maurs in hast Rush out of Spain on Corsica do fall. Avars, and Huns tam'd by the French men tall. The Saxon's 'yond the Able removd to France The Abrodites into their towns did prance. Remmingus King of Danes drops in his grave Two brethren then fight for the Crown to have. And in the battal slain upon the patch Eleven thousand Danes, a match! a match! The Normans with two hundred Sails do Stem For Frisland and a Tribute lay on them. 800In England Egbert lifteth up his head And Breaks the Heptarchy, and doth it wed Into his Crown, making himselfe Sole King. And in these dayes they feel the Danish Sting. The Normans Ireland invade, but are Trounc'd for the Same, away they do repair[.] Under the Emperours of the West. Lewis the Pious 26â813â839, East as Leo Amenius. 7. [date blotted] Michael 9â839, Theophilus. 10â840 815In Europe still I keep the Dane Expell Hariold their King. But Lewis doth them quell 819And him restores. In Brittan Murman would Be King, but Lewis hath his Courage Cold. 819Bernhard the King of Italy doth Swell Gainst Lewis. Hence his eyes and Realm down fell. The Pope, and Roman blades Lothair design For Emperour. Hence Roman Nobles Shine Under the axe of justice. And the Pope Paschal slips, by his purging Oath, the cope. 823The Vascons strive to shake off Lewis so Them of Dalmatia, and Pannonia do. Prince Euphemy in Sicily doth wed A Nun, the Pretor punish would this bed, As very wicked; he in Africk flies, And brings the Saracen which them destroyes 830The Saracens from Babylon do come And Italy infest and Rome do bum. Abats with Bishops: Celtick Princes rise And Lewis from his Scepter do Surprize Cause of his Judith's Lust and Tyranny, Lothair, and Pipin they do Cesars cry. The Emperour at Neomag gets aide Of Germans and these Conspirators paid, They soon rebell again gaining the Pope The good pope Gregory the door to ope. Going to France, report strikes Lewis ears Of Excommunication hence rose fears Wherefore the Father puts himselfe into His Childrens hands, the Monky Bishops do Then soon take Judith from him and her Crowd Into a Nunnery. And him they bowd 832In Methard Abby, but in two years space Lewis Bavare, and German Princes trace Lothair till they constrain him to let go His Father, Arms, Empire, and Wife also. At length the whole doth on the Bishops quile. Ebbo of Rhemes and's mates go in Exile. Lewis by Seven Bishops and their fray Is loosed from their Chain-Anathema. Lothair his Son falls fore his Father down 839And's reconcild, and renders him his Crown King Egbert beats Bernulph the Mercian King 826The Heptarchy's made Monarchy by him. The Danes do vex him: yet he Conquours all. 839Burthred the Britons fights: and on Danes falls. But now I to the Eastern Empire do Step. Leo no peace with Bulgar foes can get. Doth them ingage and's routed: but obtains A more Convenient place doth to't again 815Taking the foe all Scatterd down them hews, And by an Arrow Crunnus one persues, And tumbles from a Cock horse dead but is With difficulty drag'd away by his At first for Image worship bent hee burst Against dissenters out in rage was Curst. And though when better taught he changd his minde. The Hand of Michel justice him assign'd. Thomas the Generall of all the hosts Confederat brake in the Thracian coast Bangs Michel both at sea and land and pen't Him in Constantinople, till he sen't To Mortagon the Bulgar who soone brakes The Siege up, and persuite of Thomas makes And Siegd 'gainst Adrianople for him lay. The Famine there constrains they him betray. And hand him unto Michel, who doth set Him on an Ass after he off had fet His hand and feet, in Scorn him led about But Panium, Perinthus too broke out Against him. Seports till that lost its wall By Earthquakes, and the Sea made this downfall. But Stuttering Mich'el Justice off doth take By a Dread Frenzie; with the Belly ake. Bardas Mich's Unkle stained with the blood Of Theoctist, and others, comes out as mud. And Basil runs him through at th'Emp'rours feet And others hack him all to mammocks meet. And thus in Europe justice flowrish ore Doth all her Scutchons botch't with filth before. In Asia. Thomas Commanding all the Eastern lands Did bang the Wicked Saracens whose hands Did Ravage there, then settled with them peace. Job Patriarch of Antioch when Cease Brave Leo did, did Emperour him Crown Be Mich'els troop in Asia bangs knocks down. Theophilus when Emperour doth rout The Hagarens in Asian Countreyes Stout. But after they him worst. But Manuel Secar'd him, who of Emperour did Smell. Which being Smelt he fled to Saracens. And bravely ward against Curst Persians. In Africk. Euphemy calls on Sicil th'Agarens Who when they could not thence by Europes men Be drove, then Lewis under Boniface To Afrik sent his Host, who do a pace Make mighty Slaughter there hence out do high The Saracens from Sicil these to Stroy Under the Emperours of the West, as Lothair. 15.â855 East, as Theophilus. 5â845, M? Paulitian Hereticks in Asia stand For Image worship with a bloody hand. In Europe. Theophilus losing Amory stroi'd And many bravest Captains and beside Suspecting Theophobus would aspire After the Wreath, fell Sick and his desire Chargd them to Slay Theophobus, they do: He hugs his head and out this Cry doth go. I'm not Theophilus, neither art thou Theophobus, and down by death doth bow. Mich, and his Mam, then, Theodora reign The Bulgars King against her wars proclaims. Yet did delay. But Italy is wrackt 844.By Maurs, and Saracens Ben'vent is Sackt. In France are bloody noses at the town Of Fontanede Antisiodore downs Where Lewis his four Sons such S[l]aughter make 842France hath not men to keep her border-Stake. The day doth fall to Charles, and Lewis, who Constrain Lothair to part the Realm them to. 844Charles Realm runs from the West sea to the Mose. Lewis all Germany to th'Rhine ore flows. Pipin hath Aquitane. Lothair doth 'joy Italy, Rome, Lotharing, Burgundy, 846With the Imperiall Title Normans they Wast France, and range to Paris dore by Sea And bicker with the Frizers, them Subdue. And Pipins Sons Pipin and Charles out flew 852Upon their Unkle Charles in France, are caught And into Monks are turnd and manners taught. Benit, and Anastase two Popeling[s] Strive To had themselves by blood with Peters hive. 854But Lothairs Sword cut of the Quarrell so Peter is made his better still to know. Mich who up hoisted Image worship high Nigh pot shot gave his purple Shooes with joy To Basiline whom he names Emperour. Which Basill, for him Cesar made, made soure. That in the night with his Companions hee Did butcher him and now men justice see. Under the Emperours West, as Lewis Lothairs Son. 21. 87? East as Michael 3d 13âtill 86? Basil 7âtill 87? In Europe. The Saracens still rage the Cyclade iles ? Embroiles Italy smoaks. Segart Benevents Duke Is slain: and in they Saracens then took Lewis Enwreathd and's brother Lothair jar Do with them and against them go to war. In France new Stirs up boile: Charles they accuse To Lewis that he Cruelty did use. Who outs his brother, enters on his realm. Which fact of his did on him shame orewhelm. For they that did his brother thus betray, Did deale with him according to this play. To Charles they turn again, and turn him out. And from his brothers borders force his rout. The Normans harrass Nants, and Andegave In Poicteirs, and in Lions Coast they rave. Do Germany infest, tribute require King Lewis there constrains them to retire. The Danes do ravage England, and them pay As they the Britains did in former day. And thus we see bright justice fines for Sin, That blotcht these places in its Entrance in. In Asia The Saracens vex Mich'el swep his side Untill Petronas had their Duke destroy'd Those of Miletum and of Tarsus rage After Duke Andrea, who did ingage Them, by them beaten; and thus out did belch That Mary's Son the Romans grown so melch, Should not advantage, they would hang up all That on the Image did of Mary call. But Andrew out his host led: on them fell. Them slew and ? their Curst Duke slain fell. Under the Emperours West as Charles the Bald. 2. 878/ Charles the Fat-12. 800 East as Basilius/Leo In Europe. Things Still go ill in Europe. Saracens From Africk rush, the Roman Iles Smart then. In Italy great trouble. Hugo Duke Of Lombardy East Empires right off Shooke. Justice in France fines Charles the bald who did His Son calld Charloman of Eysight rid, And Boso made King of the Longbards so That Charles, and Charloman in arms do show. He smelling this, to France highs, but's down brought By's Jewish Doctor Zedekiah's draught, And now he's paid for Swallowing down the share Of which his Cousin German was the heir. His Brother Lewis King of German's Sons He on their Kingdom right or not right runs 879France still lyes reeking. Normans Scourg it feels 880And quarrells for the Crown do give them Steel. Normans and Dane with Fire and Sword run ore 882France, Lotharing, Ambian yea and more 883All to the Sheld, and elswhere they annoy The following yeare all to the Mose they stroy. Leodium, Traject, Colen-Agrippine Ban, Tylpiak, Vilipiak, Nuem shine And many more with flames to ashes thick And persons butcherd, and like beast they Stick[.] 885They ravagd thus the following yeare also And forces Charles sent out do little do: And Hugo Lothair's Son by Waldrada Who 'gainst Charles strove to take his Crown away, And pact with Godfride th'Norman for his aide, 886And made a Monk with's eyes out, and his Friends Are all Suppresst. Mark justice how she ends. The Normans to Lavan run: Paris Siege. Duke Henry's on their backs even for his Leige 887But viewing of them in their ditches falls They dug and filld with Straw he's slain withall. The Emperour compounds with them they take The tract beyond Sequane, calld Neustra make, 888It their glade which left th'Emperiall mace. And now the Name of Normandy's the place. The Emperour grown jealous of his wife Rejects her as a Whore. And after strife His pears did make did Strip him of his Crown, And Arnulph Son to Charloman's renown Brings him the Empire, the Emperour then bread Begd of him and to him's Son tendered. 879Hasting from England drove wast makes in France. 882The Danes do up and down poor England prance[.] In Asia Out of Mesembria th'Arabians run Phenice and Syria vex the Coasts along. A base Magician Leo did perswade To ware a knife in's Shooe poison to vade, Which done he told the Emperour his Dad Leo his Son treachery gainst him had Conspir'd, and wore a Dagger in his Shooe. Which Basil searcht, found so, in prison threw Leo his Son wherein he long did ly. Till th'Senate did prevaile with treaties high. Under the Emperours West as Arnulph. 12 902 East as Leo. 900 In Europe. Justice her Tribute of Europeans takes. Still Italy she in her furnace bakes. While Charles doth live Duke Beringary, and Duke Guido part the prey, and France they hand To Guido: and to Beringarie's Share Came Italy. When dead, Guido doth repare To Rome to be annointed by the pope. The French that while do design to ope Unto the throne, who now doth Guido mump. Wherefore he Cou[n]sill take how he may thump 892Out Beringary from his Italy. 897And beats him out, with th'Emperours Supply[.] The following yeare Arnulph with hosts did come On Lombardy, and Pergamenus won And Ambrose Earle there of in halter hangd Up at the Gate to Rome went and down bangd Its wall, and quelld the Pope's disturbers, so Tor'ds Guido mooves. He flies. His wife bestow Doth on Arnulph a Cup of poison high Which lai'd him three dayes in a Lethargy. 901Then being waked he Sick returned home. The Saracens too Italy did num. The Gauls, and French are harrasst greatly Still. Radulphus now Burgundy king it will. The Norman Scourge Still jearks and so the Danes Untill that Arnulph fought, and overcame Them at the Tily where with small loss hewd He down an hundred thousand as is shewd. Turks or Ungares in Bulgaria brought By Leo soon Pannonia up caught. These and such other Stirs did Europe Claw The Hagarens on Asia laid their paw. Regner King of the Danes Christ Cause would stroy: And did restore cursed Idolatry. Till Hellis whom he banisht took him and By Serpents long in jayle him tortur'd, damnd, Untill he perisht. Justice in these woes Throughout this Century still onward goes, Shewing her glorious Selfe that we may say When Sins are frollick She will Shew fare play. The Glory of Divine Efficiency Miraculous. Let's view Efficiency, and eye her shine Wherewith she doth emplaster ore this time When Charles after his dubbing did advance Unto Spoleto. Italy did dance Upon a dismall Earthquake's tottering back That Overturnd mountains, and Cities flat. Shooke down both Roofe and Beams of Pauls Church gay 801.This was at two aclock in th'night fore May. Soon after, certain places by the Rhine Did take this dance. And France attends this Rhime. And Plague persues the same. Also this Strain 803.At Charles his Palace toots at Aquisgrane And bordering places where this Earthquake wheeles. And Pestilence did follow at its heels[.] 811.Locusts from Africk jump to Italy And all things there devour egregeously. 814.The year that shut up Charles his peepholes, shown An Earthquake, Prodigies to Ears made known. And to mens Eyes, a Comet that did Change Its Shape and like an headless man did range. In the Reign of Lewis the Godly, beginning 814 820.Greate Store of ruin the aire and Earth annoi'd The Pestilence all over France rangd wide Ore men, and beasts, bread Corn and pulse all Spoild That little got Soon rots. Wine all nought, mild, Or quickly Soure. Rivers overflow In many places, many ponds doe grow. No Seedstime now in autumn many fields Admit of and the winter following Steels The Danow, Rhine, Albis, Sequane, and Other great Streams, for thirty dayes that stand, 821.Embridged ore with ice for Carts to go And when they brake up, dammage great they do. Hard by a river in Turingia A turfe of Earth was pluckt up alaway Fifty foot long and fourteen broad its said A foot and halfe in thickness and it made A Speedy journey four and twenty feet But how it mov'd account we none do meet. Ith Eastern parts of Saxony by th'lake Of Arnsey th'Earth sweld like a bank up great, And it tooke up without the help of man 822For fifty paces such a patch or Span, As made it seem like to a vally run, But by what means none tell us, it was done. In Tulla Coasts nigh to Augustodune A girle of twelve years old that did Commune At Sacrament, for ten months space refraind From bread, then from all meat and drinck abstaind For full three years, after which time she came Back to her former life with men again. Twenty three Villages in Saxony 823.Houses, Men, Cattle burnt with Lightening ly. It also Stones did rain. And hailstons such By which the Stalks of fruits were dammag'd much. A piece of ice fifteen foot long, two thick And seven broad In Burgundy down skip Did on them out of heaven: and the Plague Did rage through France all ore in deadly trade. 824Popielus King of Polony vile His Parents Curse him oft did thus assoile. Let Mice devour thee. He the same Curse usd. When by the Counsill which his Wife out musde, He poison'd had his Unkles, and his Peers Mice from their Corps leap out long for his Eares. While he was with his Wife, and Children there A glutting of his pawnch with all good cheere, His guarde to 'fende their Lord, a fire do make To drive the Mice away, in vain: which take Their journey through the fire them to devour, He to a Ship doth run: they thither poure Then through the waters. Knaw it through: the men Fearing its sinking, thrust to Shoare again. He them with his highs to a mighty tower. They them persue, and them therein devour. 825In France Hail both some men, and Cattle bains 828In Gascon bread Corn like short wheat it rains. In other places mighty heaps are found Of Grain of all Sorts in the Champion ground. Which if the Cattle tast, they forth with die. Its meale doth vanish in mens hands and fly. 829An Earthquake dandles Aquisgrane: a Storm Houses, and Temples of their Crowns disorn. 825A blazing Star in libra hangs, another 829.In Aries the next yeare, also a cother Of little fiery sparkles for Some dayes Are seen to run through heaven Sig'bert sayes. Constantinople by an Earthquake shakes Five dayes. Which many folk, houses off, takes. But pardon me, my Muse, in that my feet Still keep a Distich for Hexastichs sweet. For justice in Efficiency Divine By miracles still larums with her shine. The Matter therefore common thus to both, In tunes, that justice sung forth, thus forgoeth. But now the rest shall in those measures run Which in the former Centuries were sung Out by Efficiency, whose Warblings greet A brisk Tetrastich, with a Distich sweet. In Lothair Reign begining 840. Lightning now flasht upon a man Consumd Him up: but harmed not the Cloaths he wore. By night a Cloud out of the North coast fum'd One from the East; one from the South up bore. 841With fiery Darts stood fighting, and at last Like to an army fighting mixt was Cast. Wheate bread in oven backt blacker than inck. The Earth at Herbople shakes twenty times. Hail, Storm, Ill weather man and beast make Shrinck. And Chilians Temple Lightening calcines. 842The wind did make the Wall equall the Soile A Comet leads Lewis his Sons their broile. 847An Earthquake rattles Benevent'um's Coast. It ruins all Iserny did destroy People and Priests, and many houses tost Quite down at Vinients full Monastery. At Padeburn two Circles round the Sun Which vanisht, flames the town to ashes run. 851A grievous Famine pinches Germany. A man and's wife and son for Turing goe He her consults the Child to kill, thereby To stay their hunger. She diswades, saith no. His sword he drew, spies two Wolves eating Deer. He drove them thence, and feast on their good Cheere. 854A woman bore a monster in the shape Both of a man, and dog with bodies joynd Intire, thus back to back glide. And the Ape Pope John this year has Joan'd. And slunckt, we finde. 855Constantinople takes an Earthquakes leap. Storms Lightenings, Hail many of Life defeate. In Leo's day the fourth a Basilisk At Rome lurkt in its hole and did destroy Many that passed by it's den till whiskt Out of its den by Magick witchery His Holiness did use. Good Pope thy spell Can charm and Conjure Serpents pritty well. In Lewis the Seconds time begining 856. 856At Treviers sacred House, and Bishops Sell, A black dog seen, suddenly disappears Ments Walls, and Urban's Temple also fell Down by an Earthquake which went rattling there. In Colen Church three kild by lightnings Clap 857And six else were slaughterd were by that Crack. Tyber oreflows its bancks and molifies Laurence's Church, Sylvesters Minster much. A Demon three years playes at Mentz his toyes. Circulatory Witchcrafts and things such. He first began unseen cast Stones at some. And knock on doores. Soon in man's Shape did come. Gave answers, thefts discover'd, and some brand With note of Infamy, and stird up jars. Set barns, and Coats on fire and fire did hand On one mans side that stuck upon his spars. And burnt the house. She stird up all about To knock the brains of this poor person out[.] The man was forc'd to ly in th'open aire. All flying him as night Hobgobling ghosts. His fruits in fields got all in heap spoild ware By this foule Shade that hanted thus these coasts. Who dayly worser grew that Pagans Came To the Moguntine Pope to lay the same. Priests out are sent, to clense and Expiate Countrey, and Villages with sacred Charms. With Holy Water, Salt all consecrate The wicked elfe first stops, them Certain harms With Stones, then after with there Spells is bound. But when these cease, an other Ghost is found. Which said, While that these baldpate priests do mum I known't what in the Priests short linnen Cloake Who yester night by mine inticements run, And tupt my landlords daughter, I nere spoke And speaking thus making an hiddious cry The feriall Shade did from those quarters high. 871Clouds in the aire are seen to shine with darts Of fire shook at each other, army like. 873And lightenings burn down Worms, alas poor hearts! Blood raind in Italy three dayes and nights 874Locusts do France devour then drove in th'deep. Then famine doth a third of men off sweep. 875A Blazing Star more red than usually 876.Appeares, and mighty floods in June do flow. Which Aschoprun in Saxony destroy. Men, Cattell, Buildings Trees it down did throw. Lest not so much as any track to 'peare Of any place of habitation there. In Charles the Bald's/Fat's time. 878A dreadfull Murren of neat Cattle rose In th'Country on the Rhine and in the town Of Walsheim all the Countreys dogs, strange shows, Came to devoure the Carrion tumbled down. All in one day went in one troop away No man knows whither, from those coast went they. And after this there never more was seen. A track of any one alive or dead. 882An Earthquake shaketh Mentz, a famin keen 883In Italy doth rage. Now Corn for bread Was grown so deare they for a pound did way Five hunderd Drams of Gold for to make pay. 900When Arnulphs Army sieged Rome they start A Leveret, which ran towards the Wall. And it persu'de with Shouts, which did unheart The Romans on the Walls that down they fall. On whom on heap the Souldiers as on Stares Climb up the Wall: and all things now are theirs And now we see (grant histories are true) Efficiency to ware a glorious shine With Justice in her hand, this Century through, In Instances miraculous and fine. God rules and will Secure his Glory though Things seem[in]gly run counterbuff thereto. Sweet Truth I come at last to Kiss thy Hand With maimed Sapphicks crippled My dull Pentameters do stand Wrinckled and rippled. I in thine Honour do ingague my quill. My very Heart I truely mean. These muddy puddles do fulfill Thy Holy breathed Veans. Thou said'st a King after his Will should act. Exalt himselve all gods above. Great Words against the Lord Compact His lofty tongue should move. Romes Prelates shew this very thing in them. Whose Thunderbolts knock Princes down. And God, and Christ the precious Gem They tush upon, and frown. But on thou go'st. His Fathers God doth slight. Desires of Women looks not on Worships Maussim with Gold bright, Silver, and Costly Stone. These things Exactly shoot these darksom times The Pope regards not Peters God. Doth Harrass Wedlock from Divines: To marri'd Priests a rod. Poore Virgins by their parents misled Zeale Or by their own, ennunnerizd, May rather broile in lust or Steale A Bed, than wed. So Sisde. He Worship doth Mauzzim, Relicks, Saints Nay roagues if in his Calender. Images raisd in wealthy Paints And Sweet as Lavender. Charles Emperour on Peters Chappel gave A four square golden Table bright, Whereon he had engraved brave Constantinople right. On Peters Altar out there from him stems, A Cloath made of his gold attire: Two golden Crowns stuck thick with gems. This Worship did grow higher. Pope Adrian a Cross of mighty weight, And Worth, presents Saint Peter; which Lewis did send to Rome out right. The Fisher now is rich. Pope Stephen Quart doth daube Saint Barbary, Saint Helen too, with glorious dress. Made many golden Crosses fy. Cups, Chargers for their gues[t]s. Paschal built Praxis Abbie; and therein Stoughd grecian Monks that night and day Should to dead Saints there buried, Sing In Speech unknown[,] and pray. Sergy the Second Churches to them raisd Some toombs up set. Relicks up stows. Some tricks with Pictures all beglazd In glorious ample Shews[.] In the Tyburine Consill 'twas decreed No wooden cups should used bee, In Sacraments Now all proceed In Silver, Gold degree. Truth saith the Beast had two horns like a lamb. And like the Dragon pate he speakes Leo the fourth two Swords to bang Church Steel, and Cesars takes[.] A woman on a Scarlet Beast did Straddle Full of the Names of Blasphemy: Pope John the Eighth is Joane, in th'saddle. Here is a Mystery. This wracks Grammarians. Dad Mam's the same. The Churche's Head's Hermaphrodite. The mother Choice of Harlots plain She Styled is by right. It's Mother Church indeed. Whose He's a Hen. That laid noe Addle Egge indeed Although the Shell was broken when She laid it making Speed. Now Peters Chair is got with Child, is big Blurts out a bastard grown a Whore. Th'Abominable wanton, rig. Hic now grows Haec impure. Yet in her Hand she holds the Golden Cup Filld with abominations greate. Which still indeed is filling up. And doth with vileness Sweat. Doctors do give their drops into it, so Haimo his Vineyard this Canary Auricular Confession's to Salvation necessary. Bertram did anvill out the rod which by Paschale is made the hobnaile sole, Of Transsubstantiation's toy. Plumpt in this Wassell boale. Rabanus drops his spittle, Salt, and Oyle Of a Baptismall Shape into This Cup, making't a grease pot vile And why, Good Doctor show. And now Some Conjurer did in it drop Red iron: Fire Ordeal. And Scalding Water to un blot Such deemed Criminall. Constantinoples Synod, and Pope Dick Put Image worship in this Cup. The Divell now indeed is Sick And this must Cheer him up. Ments Counsill States, no Bishop Ist condemn With Witness less than Sev'nty two. Nor Priest than fourty four, good men. This in the Cup they threw. Triburies Counsill drops no wooden Cups Shall used be in Sacraments. Silver and gold are better tuts And fitter for their tents. Pope Sergy too the Second's dishclout wrings And thence this drop fell in it plum: An Agnus Dei Song that jings. At Mass, be three times Sung. Here is new melch his duggs drop in this jug A Papall King-encrowning Right. Leo the fourth doth milck his dug These drops hence in it lighte. Assumption: and Ascention dayes he brought. He also dropt two Swords therein Sacred and Civill Power he taught In Peters Chair did Spring. Pope Joane. (Good morrow now my masters all. Its four a Clock: a fair good morn Your Mastership men Madam call. This doth the Cup adorn.) As Zach'ries Spout dropt in it Sodomy, Your Madam Pope a bastard dropt. Here rich possesst virginity Out of your Costrill hop't. Pope Nick that Surly Sir, his nose drops in't. Such Stuff as this, it is the right Of Popes alone Synods to mint And Bishops orders plight. The Songs of Notgers Sequencies in France. And Lanton-Wedden Prohibitions. Vexatious Acts did in his dance. And wicked Superstitions. The Second Adrian his dram in't comes. A Sacramentall Purge so sweet For Prince, and Nobles that their bums, Are wipt with winding Sheets. These Papall Brewers tun into this Cup Their filthie things which, when they've done, They make all Kings, and Nobles Sup And none shall from it run. Princes they Priesterize. Brave Charloman Is made a Deacon. Basills Son His youngest Clergifide out Sprang. Miters to Nobles run Great Charles his Son Stoute Drogo's Bishop made Of Metz. Ignatius Rangabis Constantinople her hands laid Upon, he bishop't is. Charle's Sons were monkifide by Hildegard And Pipins Son Charles, who was Duke Of Aquetane had as is heard Mente Bishoprick up tooke. But this not all. Kings of this Cup must bib. They Cuff them box them 'bout their Ears. Lewis the Pious Wise must trig Poore Judith drown in tears. But worse and worse they grow. Lewis also They kick out of th'Imperiall Throne And in a Cuckow Cage him stow For to repent, and groan. They Soundly souce Lothair, who put away Theitberg his wife and with their leave. Yet when he weds with Waldrada Their raging breath they breath. The Excommunicating pellet flies At him unless he put away Waldrada, and Theitberg rise Unto his Bridall play. Poor King! Complain he doth of Peters Chair As most unjust and Shares his realm Unto his Sons: and Shaves his hair. Sits at the Shavlings healm. Pope Nick did thus as Gregory before Had Pious Lewis boxt about Who made his Sons above him Soare In arms, and's eyes pick out. These and such other prancks as these, these Done In Snouting Kings attend upon The Golden Cup likes Proes, not Cons, And it omitteth none. Hence we behold how truth doth dart her beams Of Shining Glory through these dayes Of Sour and darksom gadding theams Hobgobling all mens wayes. Wherefore my Conjue to thy Honours Shrine My glorious Lord I sacrifice. Most heartily seing thy Shine In darkness glorious rise. Grace, Patience, Justice, Rich Efficiency And Truth Divine trod under foot By Wickedness, shine sparklingly, This makes my Hymns thus toote And Harping praises thus I take my leave In a Sweet Ditty tweedling thus Of this ninth Century and bequeath The tenth my Quill and blush. Century the tenth. Farewell Ninth Century, I now bequeath A Sigh interred in thy Coasts with leave. And do Proceed to Search and try the Soile Of this tenth Century. Hence ore the Stile I climb, and come into her borders, run Through all her Coasts as I before have done, Through others, to observe What Glories shine Of Grace, of Patience, Justice, of Divine Efficiency, and Truth. Upon thy Walls But heavily I pass finding thy stalls Full most with Lobsters. And its darkesom might Wherein thou'rt led by Jack-a-Lanthorns light. The Shine of Grace. Thy Grace, sweet Grace, is glory sparkling bright That glorifies the Day wherein it shines In radient beams of blessed Gospell light That fly from Holy Lips of true Divines Not mudded with the dirt of sinfull times. Alia, alas! we bury thee in griefe, Thy Paradise of Spices Joys farewell. At Antioch one Theodore's beliefe Was preacht but what the light that from him fell Whether a Sun beam fog'd or bright, none tell[.] Africk, thy Glory too doth pickled ly, In briny tears. We've not a word of thee. Are all thy Lights blown out? We none can Spy. The mid sea Ilands too. How darke they bee? Where one bright Lights did shine we none now see. Europe Evangelizd we come to thee To try the Lights in thy Bellconies set For passengers to guide aright that bee At Sea with hoised Sayles that they may get Into the Harbour of Good Hope their net[.] In Thrace we finde but few. Theophylact Constantinoples Light Epitomisd Brave Chrysostom, but his Circingle slackt To let in many Errours which disguisd His flame. The rest are lesser to be prizd. Poor Greece, thy Lights are gone. Hungary too Soon slips from Christ when Charles the Great was dead. But Geyse Hungarie's King did Christ een shew And Pilgrine Bothave's bishop back them led To Gospell Laws: with Wilfgang's hand and head. At Hamborough Adolward did teach the Word And to the Vandals held out Gospell Grace. Methodius Marovia's bishop, spurd With holy Zeale Bohemy's king in place And Queen he gains the Gospell to embrace. Cyrill his brother follows in his Seate And many of the Sclaves he over brings Unto the Gospell, then he Rome did treate That in their Native tongue Christ law might ring A voice from Heaven then did do the thing[.] The eastward Vandalls, whose chiefe tribes we call Polabs, and Obatrits, Kissins and still The Winuli, and Circipans withall Not gaind to Christ, do feel the Gospell Skill In wining them thereto in minde and Will. Religion now doth Spring in Prussia Polonia too the Gospell now accepts Brought first by merchants from Bohemia. The Swedes that from the faith withdrew respects Erick their King their Paganry Corrects. A Pagan priest, the people standing by, While he was offering his Sacrifice Is smitten blinde. He turn'd to Christ his Cry, And so miraculously gain'd his eyes And now to preach the Gospel up doth rise. He down doth batter Idols, people throng Unto the Faith seing this Wonder Wrought. Erick sends for, and Christian Doctors come And Adalward and Stephen soon them taught And Breme was then Metropolis its thought. Othincare Alb, a priest of noble race In pious Zeale his Office doth attend In Zeland and in Scandia tendering Grace. Volkward of Aldenburgh his journey bends To Norway and the Gospell seed thence sends. Gorma that Cankerworm king of the Danes Had almost rooted out the Gospell thence Till Henry King the first him quells, sustains The Gospell. And sends Unni for defence There of from Hamburgh who did truth dispense. Some say that Bruno Colens Bishop brought Nortalbingens, Holface, and Denmarke too Stormar, yea and the Dithmar nations naught With mighty pains, and Cost to Christs faith true. Some say by fire Ordeal, this grew. Otho the first a mighty multitude Of Saxon Pagans to the Faith constrain'd And in his reign authors have also Shew'd The Livons, Escons, Curons also gain'd With Luzats and Norwegians Converts nam'de. Albert, Son of King of Sclavonia, That won Bohemy, Prage enjoyd their Light. But doing little good there, went away With others, and the Hungars taught with might And hath an harvest plentious a Brave Sight. Thence to the Poles he goes, there favour findes, Miecislaus Duke give the Archbishoprick Of Gnesn to him, but hence soon he windes To the Borussi them to teach who kick: And nigh Fisshausen slay him. (Darkness thick!) For, whose dead Corps Boteslaus the Duke Of Poland gave the Pagans so much gold As it would weigh, and gain'd it by this hook And it interrd with Honours manifold At Gnesn solemnly as we are told. In Fulda Ralph the monke with learning shone At Hirsauge Blind Edelhard did fore shew His death three years before hand, and made known The ruin of the Abby there most true Full eighty years before the place did rue. In England Smaragd and monke Serle are said With Glory bright of lear[n]ing to arise. But with a brighter Shine indeed ore laid The marri'd ministers whose holy guise Oppose the pope, that Dunstan's Divell Cries Spain, Italy, France, Germany also And other lands do gallant men out bring Of Wisdom, Learning and of Glorious show But they, as pious, are describd to cling And give advance to Rome's greate man of Sin. No doubt but greater Gospell Glory far Of Grace and Holiness did others tend Fixt in a lower Orb, than any Star Fixt in archbishopricks that did extend Its influence on Such that have them pend. And hence, as lower Shines, though far more high The Methamatick overlooks while he Lies gazing on the Stars, these are passt by By th'Pen men of the times, that could not see Dazzled by glorys that on Prelates bee. The which as worldly and not Gospell Shines Filling all Bishops sleeves in ev'ry place I do not mention: but bewaile these times So gloriously out shining to disgrace The Gospell, and its Holy Shine out race. The Shine of Patience. I now arrive at Patience Stately Courts To see how She is deckt, and her Comports Through out this Century, the Which wee finde Dealt with like rusty Steele, the which men grinde And file to make it bright and shining: so Rich Patience to the Grindlestone must go Pride, Lies, Lust, Superstition, Cruelty. Do Grinde her to the Quick. She shines thereby[.] Pride. Now PRIDE doth Churchmen steeple very high The Crosser's Staffe out shines in majesty The Golden Mace, and Scepter. Kings lay down Their Diadem under a miter'd Crown. To be a Monke, Priest[,] Abbate, Bishop now A Patriarch, or Cardinall, men vow, Is here so rich, and glorious a thing Earles, Dukes, and Princes, with its glory spring. Hence Clergy men are often arm'd for war And better Soldiers than Divines by far. Better in Mars his Camp brandish'd with Steel: Than with Christs Gospell Sword make Sinners feel. Their glory better fits the Court, and Camp Than Pulpit which sets on men's Souls Christs Stamp. And here an instance take brought in our Way, Of Clergified Noble of this Day Otho the Great, that wore th'Imperiall Wreath, In Germany, had's blood of his did breath Under Prelatick Glory that it catcht. William his Son, which his Queen Edith hatcht (That English Queen) Mentz'es Archbishopricks Verde's bishop Bruno too his Grandson,) skipt Colens Archbishop Bruno was his Brother. Theodorick bishop of Mets, another Nam'd Almarick of Spires that Bishop was, (And others more the which we overpass) Were both his Cousins: and one Otgerus His Counsilour was Spires great Bishop, thus, Was Otho's Stock a Stock of Bishops bright. The second Otho of Imperiall might Suppli'de the Bishopricks with Courtiers too For Heldebald his Chancollour up grew Into the Bishops Throne of Worms. Also Herbople's Bishoprick did fall unto Hugo his Counsellour. But on I'l pass Golfry that Bishop of Argentine was Had the Fat Emperour Charles his Unkle's Shine Dukt Reiners brother there thence calld Rich wine Possesst that Bishoprick, in all its shine Richard a branch from Englands Kingly line Was Bishop of Manastvience its said. Falcher, who Bishop was of Noviomage, Was Bastard of the Emp'rours Lewis's Cook. And eate to Death by lice ? him forsook. Boso Placentums Bishop we espy Bastard to Hugh the King of Italy, Albert that Bishop was of Paris cleare Was Son of Balwin Prince of Flanders were[.] Prage's Bishop Albert was King Lubeck's Son King of the Sclaves. Arnulph to whom did run Th'Archbishoprick of Remes, was brother to Lothair the King of France. Also they show That Mentz Archbishoprick also did trig To Hatto bright the French Kings royall twig. And unto Hildebert who was the brother Of brave Duke Ederhard and of the other Nam'de Conrade king of Romans. See the glory. In Wormes's Bishoprick we finde in story Franco a noble Personage of Hess. Conrade did Constatice-Bishoprick possess; He was Earle of Antorffe, and after him Gebhard Earle of Bregentz was set therein. Herboples Bishoprick on Bernard came The Earle of Rotenburgh, a man of fame. Poppo before him sat here in this Seate The sisters Son of famous Otho Greate. Augusta's Bishoprick adornd these men Adelbert who was Earle of Dillingen. Then Huldrich a Noble Sweve won't. So And after him Henry a Son unto Burchard the Earle of Geisenhusen, and Then Etticho Earle of Altorse it mand. I'le go no further in this path: Here see How Bishopricks like handballs tossed bee From Prince to Prince, From Earle to Earle and Who The Chruches Masters, or Church Landlords grow. What pride is here? How doth the Church thus swell? Patience lies bleeding[.] Venom beares the Bell. Popes. But now I'le step to Rome, and cast mine Eye To see the glory of that Holy Sty. And whether tis a Patience trying glory Some notes will answer in the hints before yee. 899Pope John the tenth an heady Head, presumes To fix Formosu's Acts: Rome at it fumes Is in an Uproare. Like a Serpent he To Save his head did to Ravenna flee. A Counsill calls of Bishops seventy four, Charles Simplex King of France attends this Whore. He ratifies Formosu's Acts, and burns Stephens Decrees who them off throws and spurns At all Ordain'd by Pope Formosus men That should be reordain'd. Which done he then 901Return'd to Rome and slips into his Grave. Then Benit Quart presumes the seate to have, 904Who left it all perfumed with's Civit bum To the fifth Leo upon whom there run Vile Christopher one of his household birds 905And make a jayle bird of him. (Sir soft Words) And crouds into the Chair by wicked Arts, The Head, a Vilain, what are other parts? Now at him Rome inraged up arose Their Head a Shavling make did him inclose Within a Cloister then into a jayle Where like a Rogue he died, The Church-Heads faile. Sergy the third, the hand that man'd this deed Did Vi and Armis to the Chair proceed[.] He institutes Wax Candles as men say Upon the Ladies Purifying Day. 913But up he kicks: and Anastase the third Did to the Miter come, a better bird. 915Then Lando, (who lackt not the Porphory Chair, Proofe of his Maledom John the Eleventh were Who was his tread,) the throne ascends on high. Crowns Berengarius King of Italy Five months he fumes the Chaire and then did fling It to his Cockerill to roost therein. John Dean of brave Ravenna's beauty flies With Chanting beams through Theodora's Eyes A Whore of Rome. She gains the Bishoprick First of Bonenia for him, by her trick Then of Ravenna: then of Rome, that she Might have more of his Chamber Companie, And in the Chair the Letters of his pride, Do fly abroad. He storms and fiercely Chides King Edward of thee, England, indeed As irreligious. And out did proceed With Capua's Princes, Landulph, Arnulph and Constantinoples Emperour in hand, Against the Sarracens in Italy And bangs them off, returns triumphantly To Rome, with arrogance ascribs all Glory Unto himselfe. Hence did as runs the Story, Offend brave Alberick who aided much. Hence out of Rome he thrusts him in a t?ch. Who hence with Hungars Italy ore run And Spoild them more than Sarracens had done. The Sarracens recoile burn Benevent And unto Rome to ruin it are bent. But Guido Earle of Tuscany them routs. Assaults Pope John, his brother Peter outs And slays before his Eyes, in prison flings His Holiness. His Souldiers as his stings 929Did with a Pillow Smoother him. Sad things. But yet its said Ravenna people flew With one accord upon him and him threw Out of the City in tumultuouswise As an invader of the Churches joyes. Will John the Cockerill of Lando gone Seditiously they Pope another John. Pope Sergiu's bastard by Marozia That Roman Harlot that did beare all Sway. But yet Rome will not beare him: out he goes: Leo the sixth another bastard rose Head of the Church. Merozia makes a mess For him of Poison, did him dispossess. 930Stephen the Seventh takes the golden throne, And drinks of Leo's spiced Wine, Deaths groane. 932The twelfe Pope John, Son of the Whore Maroze Pope Sergiu's Bastard treds the Chair, and crows For five years Space, then left his Cushion to 937Stephen the eighth, who in their broiles a blow Or more misfigured his face that he Withindores lurkt, him out they shall not see. 941Martin the third doth follow him four years Then Agapit the second in appears Snouts Berengarius King of Italy 955And leaves the Chair to John thirteenth to ly. Constrain'd access thereto. A Head to lurch. Rather an Head of Harlots than the Church. He first ordaind the Emperour that hee By Popes of Rome Augustus Crownd should bee. When Otho had cleard Italy nigh all From Berengariu's Wars, had ? fall Much Honour. And th'Imperiall Diadem Set On his head by John, this pleasd good men. The Emperour whose zeale in love did flower, Admonished his Holiness to scoure His life of all Unworthy deads and't frame As did become one in his place and name. And so he and the Pope by mutuall Oath Oblig'de each others Faith betwixt them both. But soon his Holiness destroys his Faith And joyns to Albert now who quickly hath Rome ope to him. Two Cardinalls thence fly Unto the Emperour, and it descry. The Pope and Albert pillag, and to make wast Of Peters Church and Unto Corfia's hast About, but John like to a roague doth stray Upon the mountains of Campania Having first took those Cardinalls and cropt One of two Fingers, Nose, and Tongue, and Chopt The others hand off. Otho yet did send Inviting Letters to him back to bend. But stay a While. I will not. Hence he led A Counsill now at Rome to judge their Head, The Hearts the Seate of Grace, the Head of Brains. The Body sums up how the Head hath stains This lift it doth produce. This head ordain'd A Deacon in his Stable, and is staind With Simony, making for Silver bits Bishops, yea a boy of ten years old, brave Wits. He guilty was of Sacralegetious Sin Adultery and Incest with his Kin With two own Sister, and of Perjury. And was a very knar of Cruelty. His Ghostly Father Benit lost his eyes Whereby he lost his life, by's Cruelties. He pared off the Genetalls of one Poore Cardinall (Eunuchs attend Kings throne) He walked arm'd with Sword Shield, Helmet fine And to the Divell dranke an health in Wine. He calls on Jupiter, on Venus, nay And Other Demons at his Dice and play. He minded Hunting. But when Mass he said, He did not then co? nutricate: Delai'd To fortify himselfe: with Cross, neglect Mattins, and Hours Canonick to respect. These Crimes alledgd Otho to him sends to Appears, and purge himselfe, Stay Sir not so. I am too guilty age? But see my Art. (The Brains lie in the Head, not in the Heart.) If you create another Pope, Ile speede To Excommunicate you all indeed. They send another letter to him still. But cannot find him. Hence it is the Will Of all the Synod, John shall out. And Chose Leo Octave, and to the Chaire he goes. But now Johns Brain pan works and under hand Assures the Citizens, that for him stand If they take Otho off, and Leo slay, He all the Churches treasures would out lay Upon them, as he to his harlot brave Saint Peters golden Cups and Crosses gave. They fall about the Work. But Otho's men Do hew them down apace. He worketh then When Otho was gone home, with's Harlots, who Prevaile with Roman Nobles: and they go To slay poore Leo, but he slipt away Tripping to Otho. Now gains the day. Gets in the Chair again, and Cockerill like Fell Crowing, yea and treading too, in Sight. But while he trod the Hen, her Cock did fly, 962And gave him his Deaths Wound effectually. Leo octave now with Imperiall might While this was doing onward journying Streight And John thus blown, the hare braind Romans make On Benit Pope: and Leo off do shake But Soft awhile. Leo is now too stoute Backt thus with Otho to be Shuffled out. For Otho coming to Romes gate, they ope 964Unto him, and to th'pot must go this Pope. And Leo is again fixt in the Chair And Benit left unto his pleasure were. Who Banisht to Hamburgh there to bide And from Romes Men, and Clergy's laid aside By Synod law the Power to choose the Pope Unto the Emperour where Lodg'd their hope. 964And then Pope Leo leaves his Glorious Shine To John the fourteenth of that name so fine On whom unfolded were the blossoms, soone Of Cruell Pride on Peter (who of Rome Levetenant was who had him prisoned), Whom by the Hangman hee envenomed With Sweet revenge, ti'de by the Haire made stay To Constantine's Stout horse even all the Day, Then set him on an Ass, with hands fast ti'de Unto the taile to please his haughty pride And face turnd to the Asses hinder parts Did Scourge him through the Citie Oh! he Smarts. And banisht him away to Germany Must this be judgd the Popes Humility? Otho the Second and his Queen's head dubs With the Imperiall Diadem: and hubs The Church of Capua into a Spire Of Metropolitan, and Vane on't higher. Did send the Cardinall Egidius To Poland to ordain there bishops thus, And charge them to acknowled[ge] Romes high Pope The Churches Chiefest Head. And now out broke Baptizing Bells and giving of them names. And he the greate Bell of the Laterane Babtizd, and gave his one name to the Same. 972But death allayes his Plumes. And throws his place On Benit-Sext, murder'd by Boniface Donus the Second fills it for awhile, 976Then Boniface the Seventh in't doth Quoile A Cruell monster whom none could abide Who robd the Church and fled: the gap now wide Lets John the fifteenth in to Peters Chaire. Who blinded, and in jayle too famisht were. But Boniface with haughtiness and force Assumes his Chair. And in his Cruell Course Puts out the Eyes of John a Cardinall Then Conscience galls him. Death doth on him fall. His karkass in the Lateran Street is cast, And stob'd with Pikes, and Swords, then 'terd at last. 977The Seventh Benit then arose a limb Of Antichrist as those preceding him. And as the Ensign of his towering pride Did weare a Sword of Bloody Mars ats Side. Did nose and novice all the Peers of Rome, And Crowns the third Prince Otho. And doth fume Upon the Roman nobles: Some Exiles. Other in Cruell bonds and prisons Spoiles, 784But Deaths attachement on his Headshipt's clapt. And John the Sixteenth in the Seate is Snatcht. And out and quickly in the Prison lies And famished, by hunger in it dies. Then John the Seventeenth by Marshall knack Sat down, and made poore Peters Chair to crack. When Lothair King of France a Synod calld And Arnulph Bishop outed, this so galld His holiness, his Pride did swell so high He calls another Synod by and by And Arnulph inns again and outeth him That was made bishop of the Frankish King. Crescentius too, who did by might presume To take up the Dominion over Rome Did fright Pope John that he to Otho sends Who coming, Crescens with the Pope made friends. Must now fall down before his feet full low. And Happy made a kiss on them to throw. But after all his pride he's worms meate made 994And Death doth hord him up in Lethall Shade. The which the Emperour hearing of, did take His Household Priest, learn'd Bruno, for kinsake. Son unto Otho Duke of Swethland, and Sends him to Rome that on him they might hand The Popedom, which they do. And do him name Greg'ry the fift, but soon they him disclaime. Crescentius domineers again in Rome And Gregory flies. And John Placentine soon Doth buy the Popedom, a man ambitious Vile And therein Swells and huffs a little while. But Otho comes, the City Siegeth then, The City trembles let him in with's men. Cressentius and Pope John fly to the tower Strong of Saint Angell. Which indeed the Power Of Otho seemd too mean to win. So lo Now by the Name Cressence's Tower't doth goe. They are commanded thence in hope of Life And out they passing, are snapt up in Strife Cressentius on a poore Jade's made ride With face towards its taile through city wide, In greate disgrace. Then's members were cut off And 'fore the City Walls hang'd up in Scoff. John was depriv'de of's Eyes, Ears, Nose, Place, Life. Fare well John Eighteenth Pope so ends the Strife Greg'ry thus settled, doth Constitute Mentz, Trevirs, Colens Bishops (thankfull fruite). Marquess of Brandenburgh, Earle Palatine Of Rhene, the Duke of Saxony, in fine King of Bohemy for Electors Free Of th'Emperour of Germany. Then he That is Elected to the Pope must go Who must the Diadem on him bestow. Thus now you see a Sorry Priest ore top Kings, Princes, Emperours, yea, and what not? Yet to his Pot he goes: and leaves his Chaire. Sylvester then the Second Sprung up there A Cursed Wizzard, daily Converse had Ev'n with the Divell. How now pope (what mad) He Secretly did keep an Head of brass. By which the Divell answerd, when this ass Did ask him touching things to come. And hee Desirous for to know how long his glee And glory he possessed should abide The Divell subtilly to him repli'de Thou shalt not dy unless thou Celebrate Mass in Jerusalem. His headships pate Secure hereat thought death was far off then Nere minding passing to Jerusalem. But at the time calld Quadragisima As it a Custom was, he Mass did say In Sancta Crux'es Chappell and there fell Into a burning fever. And a knell Or noise of Divells Sounded in his eares. And asking what the Chappells name was? Feares Did greatly rise, hearing that it was calld Jerusalem. And now his Conscience galld Him to the Quick, he doth bewaile his Sin, And tells the Cardinalls there neere to him. And chargd them much an holy life to live And unto piety themselves up give. And bad them cut and tare his Corps when dead And put it in a Coach which two Steeds led And bury it where ere they drew it. They This done, did draw it of themselves away, 1002Unto the Lateran Church none did them drive And there is buri'de was. And when not alive. And ever since they do prognosticate The Death of th'Pope when they do heare a Shake And rattling of his bones within his tomb And by its Sweate. Looke to't ye popes of Rome. Now in this Bead rowle of these Head[s] of Pride We see Gods Patience Exercisd and tride And Shining gloriously. Unto whose praise We have thus counted what did fill these dayes. The Lies of Horrid Shape, and Scarlet die Staining this tract of time do also try Patience Divine untill't out shine the Sun That in its glorious Charriot out doth run. What Lying Words. What Doctrine black of Lies? What Lying Miracles did Monks devise? And not a few, nay Waggon loads, might here Be Summed up. But for false words give Eare. The Normans who their Faith with Christ did plight Contrary there unto Christs Gospell spite. King Olaus the Dane baptism took. And yet his Paganism not forsooke. Swenotto Otho's Godson did desert The Gospell and up Idoll Gods erect. Contrary to baptismall Promise, nay The Vandalls do the same game also play. So did the Swedes before them. Thus gross lies Provoke Gods Patience, of the largest Sise. I come to other lies. Pope John the Base Being Pope Lando's bastard, that did Chase The Sarracens from Italy by th'aide Of Capua's Princes and that noble blade Alberick Marquess of Hetruria Was not asham'd to graspe in glorious way The praise of all unto his worthy Acts Contrary to his doing or his facts Guido the Earle of Tuscany calld then By this Pope John against the Sarracen And quelld their might, now rose contrary to His Faith against this pope, and Choaks him so. Pope John the twelfth plighted fealty By which with Otho like a roague did ly. And ran unto the foe, and joynd with him Against this Emperour. Have Popes no Sin? The fifth Pope Benit swore to Otho they Would choose no Pope without Imperiall Sway. And yet against the Emperours design Unto the Popedom rose and thither climb. Pope John eighteenth's a lying paraclite, By fraude, and Guile in Peters Chaire was height. But pass we now to lying Doctrine's and We see the former lying Doctrines stand In paint and with Aditionalls, each page B'ing brighten'd by the Comments of this age. They say Greate Hugh the King of Italy Brake up his Siege of Painteirs and did fly Drove thence by Storm and tempest Christ out bears Which old Saint Hilary raisd by his prayers. That Dead Saints come, and tell men what to do The Floriake monks proove thus, in that they stow Up old Saint Benits bones at Orleans when The Normans harrast france and drew to'wrds them And burnt their Abby down. That following night Saint Benit did appeare in Vision bright To Earle Sigillous on whose charge did ly The care and Safty of th'Monastery, And Chad him for his Sloath. Hence he out goes And with Small Strength them utterly ore throws. Sarolth Duke Geisa's Wife the Hungar, when With child, Dreamd that Saint Stephen came again And bad her of good cheer be, put her trust In Jesus Christ: for she a brave boy must Bring forth to ware Pannonia's royall crown. Like whom Pannonia never saw come down Among them: and should Canonized bee At last. And give thou him my Name. quoth hee. And disappear'd. Sarolth at this out came And smoaks all Altars now to Stephen's name. Dunstan, that Wizzard, doubting in his minde Whether he the Church of Winchester him signd Should wall or no? dreams that he saw full cleare That Peter, Paul, and Andrew did appeare. Andrew with an Angellicke voice spake sweet My Yoake take up: and learn for ?m meek. Of Peter he was bad his left hand stretch Who quickly shooke it with a ferule Squitch, This unto thee must be a punishment Of Priested slighted: and a Sign intent Of it no more to be neglected. So He did accept without all other show. And after this King Eldred falling ill Sent for Saint Dunstan. Hast he makes with Skill But as he went, this Voice from high him calls King Eldreds dead. Down Dunstan['s] horse dead falls. And in Deaths pangs he saw the Seraphims In Sweet Antiphonies thus forth to sing Oh! King of Nations, Lord, of all things, and The Virgin Mary, with her Sociates stand Attending on him. O vile Dunstan, how Canst thou these lies assert with bishops brow? And to a vow old Relicks vertue have To heale Diseases heare some tables grave They say that Al'se, th'Greate Earle of Flanders wife Sick of Disease incurable her life Past hope obtain'd recovery before Saint Bertines altar as she did adore. They say Ludolph bishop of Noviomage Washing the Corps of Landoald there laid Young Theodard Ostburg that all dumb were Began to Speake at first. What news is here? A Prefect (as they say) of Otho lay Possessed of the Divell, did defray The filthie fiend, wearing about his neck Of Peters chain which gave the Ghost his Check. A Palsy Priest (they say) was brought and laid At Dunstans Tomb, was whole again there made But he the glory of't would not ascribe In's Caps to Dunstan, hence he quickly slides In to't again. And out he sent at last His Spirit with an horrid lowing blast. And at this tomb a man posessed stood Did Vomit up a Demon with much blood. That Saints are to be worshiped thus they proove In that Walarick and Richary move Did proud Hugh Capit to be king because He sav'de their bodies: worshipt all their paws. So too in that when th'battell doubtfull hung Betixt the Rossi, and the Romans Sprang A Storm that Rag'd in the Barbarians face A knight most brave many beheld with grace Defending of the Romans and did breake The Enemies ranks: and then a Woman spake And said she saw our Lady come the day Before the Fight with her greate train away Thus speaking, Master Theodore, my John Zimis and thine greate danger is upon. Come help him quickly. Hence they deem they may Adore, the Virgin Mary, to her pray. When Sergius like a Swine did with his Snout Root up Formosu's Corps and throw them out Into brave Tyber, which being found and had Unto Saint Peters Church, and buried As it came in the Images did stand And it adore, and greet. Oh! lying band. When Othelwald was Glasenbury Monk The Abbot there did of him clearly jump In to this Dream, He saw a tree whose limbs Spred ore each Quarter of the Land and things Therein, whose tops bore little monkish couls And one greate large one ore all these small fou[ls] That did them cover ore, was this a ly? Yet Monks like bees soon ore the land did fly. When Dunstan and the Pope rose up and drives Wedlock from Ministers, and so their Wives And cast them out of their estates alass, And from their Offices, which facts soon pass For nothing. They restored were again. The monks then by their Monkery obtain The holy Rood to end the Contest, which Gave out this Oracle, or Dunstans Witch They that do favour thus the Ministers Suppose not Well. O! monkish juglers. It's said, that Dunstan who did didicate A certain Church, and water faild, did take His Staff and stroke it on the ground. Whereby Water did largely flow thence Speedily. Another Church not standing duely east As he was Dedicating he addrest His Shoulders to it and soon set it right This is a ly: Or Dunstan's Divells might. The Divell tride its said, in barelike Shape The Crossiers Staffe from Dunstan's hands to take. But the good bishop did well favouridly His jerkon Swaddle: Dunstans verily. Dunstan at prayre alone upon the day Of Christs Assention greeted was, they say, By Cherubims, and Seraphims, who said The Son of God on whom thy Love is laid Commands thee if prepar'de, to come and keep This day with us. To whom he said, these Sheep Can't Spare me on this day, or such like say, Then let it be they said, on Sabbath day. Dunstan consents, and they away depart. Dunstan then mass't it so as toucht the heart. Of those that heard him, who did here his Voice Not like a man, but Angells; Very Choice. And did declare his death at hand, and so When dinner passt, in th' Orators did go And shew'd the place where he would buri'de bee. And then fell Sick: and so to bed goes hee. And three times to the roofes vault up is ta'en And gently is let down to th' earth again And blessing them there who repli'de AMEN, He passt to his who called him to them. Oh! horrid lies fain'd of this Wizzard Vile. Archbishop men, of Canterbury, Style. He's also said when dead to meet, and whip A Monk that from his monkish life did trip. And to appeare unto a Woman who In London was[?] at point of death brought low. And askt her if shee did desire to live? She wholy did she said. Then did he give Casula in Westatta-Abby Her this advice. The miter in the Chest Put in the Casule. And thou shalt be drest With health again. She did it, and grew well. Strange Story: sure a Necromantick Spell. What lies are here? How many? mighty? black? A nough indeed to crush and breake the back Of my poore pen: and Patience wipes her Eyes That perboild are in tears to see such lies. Lusts. Patience abusde, doth more abuses meet By Lusts that Strangle do her holy Sweet Delightsom breath, broyling in Prelates breeches And Monky tailes, smokd like to baken flitches In Abby Goose rens: Henroosts, Nanneries. I shall not instance much of other Sise. One Theodora vile, a roman Whore Two girles more arch than She in whoredom bore. The first Marozia calld Pope Sergui's mare Pope John the twelf's own Mam. She did him beare. And she when Guido Earle of Tuscany Her husband di'de. Hugh King of Italy His brother takes into her bed vile hagge. The other Theodora nam'de, she nagg Was to Pope John the 'leventh, whom he rode And many more whom she allur'd her Strode. Erct regard Marquess Adelbert's once Wife Her filthy Lust obtain'd in her Such life That she her filthy body prostrate laid To Noble and Ignoble as its said Edgar the King of England, beside His Whoredom with Alphreda turnd aside Unto his Nunnish Whore Wilfreda, and King Edwin doth of Incest beare the brand. Willa the Wife of Berengary playd The filthy Whore with a poor Priestly blade. King Hugh had many Concubines beside His wife whereof he utterly destroy'd Three namely Venus, Juno, Semelee, He nam'd, as Pagan Goddesses nam'd bee. But now I'le turn to Peters Chair where flocks A treading traile indeed of Dunghill Cocks Pope Sergius tred Marozia, Guido's hen. Pope Lando hath his Bastard (may bee ten) Pope John the leventh hath an errant Whore Marozia's Sister, called Theodore. Pope John the twelfth a Son now of a Whore And's Whorish mother Maroz'up are bore Do rule in Rome both Church and State indeed. What can be lookt for but a Whoredom Seed? Pope John the thirtee[n]th made the Hall a Stie Of Harlots, and with Sisters two did ly. Whore's were his greatest friends, by whose brave aide When he unpoped was, was new pope made. Did Peters golden Crosses, give away And Calices to harlots for their pay. Constrain'd the English Clergy from their Wives By Dunstans hand. Oh! se how Whoredom thrives. But yet was Spurd into his brains as he Was in his Whordom So death had his fee. This cursed ranck that bannish from their pens Chast Wives, no Capons are. They cockle hens And tread too: their turkie Combs decleare To ery one what Cockerills they are. I'le rake no longer in this kennell vile Which Exercise doth patience all the While. Superstition We now with Patience in our hands do pass To view her face in Superstitions glass. And finde therein her Exercise so greate That far exceeds what ever I can speake. Those [?] nests of superstition built up by Last Century, and Eggs therein supply With flocks of birds of Superstitious breed (Scarce any addle proove of such a Seed). They fill the very Sky. And all their tunes Their Cherpings make are fopperies of Romes And all the Superstitions of last age Are now in fashion and accounted Sage. They were so many there is hardly room For an addition. Frollick witts Scarce bloom With any new one, yet Dunstans Sleepy pate Did blossom Kyrie-Eleeson of late. After this way. King Edgar hurting goes Would Dunstan have stay, his return with those With him, ere he said Mass, Dunstan repares Unto his massings. On the Altar beares His Elbows and his head: and takes a nap Waiting King Edgars Speed. And hath the hap To heare a Quire of Angells sing this Song Kyrie Eleeson: so this ditty sprung. Pope Sergy would, with Candle light, the skins Of Spirits in the aire to Scorch, and Sindge That he ordaind that men should Candles beare At Candlemass to Chase out of the aire Away the Evill Spirits thence this was The rise, and very birth of Candlemass. Pope John the fourteenth of that name brought in Baptizing Bells with names. Oh! horrid thing! John Abbot of Cassina did adorn A Cross with many Gemms for to be born About when in Procession they did goe Planets and Plurrall Vests for worship too. Will Magantine a golden Cross did frame With Image of our Lord hangd on the Same The weight of which six hunderd pounds was so And he on Padeburn Churchyard [?] it did throw. Otho the third did Spires brave Church provide A golden Image of Christ Crucifi'de In which the Emperour's own image fresh Most bravely Stood set in a lively dress. Otho did give Saint Stephens Altar in Corbeia, Hugh's rich golden button trim That Sparkled Shiningly, admired made With a variety of Gems enlaid. All things now run in Superstitious guise. Gods worship too a tongue unknown annoies Baptismall water. Priests do Consecrate On Easter Sunday (Moses-like in State In Passing ore the Sea:) they split with hand And on it blow a blast, then set to Stand A lighted taper in't: Fier-Pillar's Shine At night, and so baptize at evening time[.] They Consecrate, Cross, Grease with oyle also The Chrism. They the Child baptizd grease do And this they do if grown up as he stands On one foot: him Cross too, and laid on hands. Severety in Censures superstitiously When list doth Serve. So Dunstan's shot did fly Against King Edgar, who defild a nun, And Seven years penance now the King must run, Not for the Sin of Fornication but Because the Harlot was a Nunnish Slut. It would be tedious here to shew how they With Superstition now all things defray Nay quite deface, and marr. That Patience greate Abused greatly is and's made to Sweate In holding off the hand of Gods revenge But leaving here. My pen now further tends. Cruelties I now go out from Superstitions Fold And enter do into the Shambles bold Of Cruelty. And see would fain how there Choice Patience butcherd lies nigh ery where. Yet here 'twould be too long to trace this Story From Realm to Realm, I'le chiefly set before yee How Peters Chair is crusht with Cruelty Untill the Elbow Stayes thereof Cry Fy. Pope Christopher, the houshold Chapling blade Unto the former pope hands on him laid, And laid him in cold irons in the jayle Untill hee dies for griefe to see the taile Of his own house thus Sting him, and in Sum Good Peters Chaire after this Sort to bum. Pope Sergius then takes Christopher to taske And as the Peoples hate, being a Cask Of Cruelty, he him a Shavling thrusts Into a monkish Stie. Yet thence he's rusht Into a jayle laden with irons till His Soule doth from his body thereby drill[.] This Sergy's judge, Scarce any whit below In Cruell Tyranny to Nero, who Rak'd Pope Formosus eighty years dead and gone Out of his grave, Pontifick robes put on, And set him on the Papall throne though dead, And then comanded to cut off his head And of his fingers three, and then to cast His Carkass into Tyber at the last. Pope John the leventh, Lando's bastard vile Drove Alberick from Rome, who back doth quile To Italy with an Hungarian aide Who makes more Spoile, than th'Saracens had made. The Saracens being bangd by Guido, he Upon this Pope his master needs must bee. He takes his brother Peter 'fore his eyes, And putteth him to death in cruell wise Then into Prison claps his Headship, Covers His mouth ore with a Pillow, and him smothers. Leo the Sixt, Stephen the Seventh too A Spiced Cup, or Ratsbain, over threw. Now John Octavian popes it, whom they Style A monster, Limb o'th'Divell: yea most vile. His Tyranny thus Sparkles. He did take Benit his Spirituall Dad and's eyes out brake Whose pain him slew, One Cardinall he took Cut off one hand: another made a Mute Whose tongue, nose, and two fingers he off pares. Did make a Capon of another fair By shaving off his manliness whereby He could not tread. But oh! this Cruelty The fourteenth Pope nam'd John, one Peter who Was Rome's Lievetenant, and one Godfry too Earle of Campania, two Consulls, and Twelve Senators, and many Nobles stand Up and lay hands upon and cruely Imprison for eleven months well nigh. Greate Otho comes for his reliefe, but while He came, Earle Gotfry, and his Son requoile Into Deaths Cabin. (Some do think and say, They were took down by th'Prince of Capua) When Otho came he those twelve Senators Doth Crucify: The Consulls two debars And banisheth, rakes up again the bones Of Gotfry, and his Son. And them like Stones Throws up and down, but this Lievetenant must Unto the Pope be brought, who him untrust, And ty'de him naked by the Hair all day To Constantines own Steed, by th'Hangman, nay, Then Set him on an Ass, with's face there found Towards the taile, his hands thereto hard bound He's thus Scourg'd through the City quite, thus Spoild He into Germany at last's exild. Pope Benit Quint a Wealthy man of Rome Did Captivate, and bring unto his tombe Some say by famine, others rather sound It by an halter. And was never found. Pope Boniface the Seventh whom men call An Horrid Monster, who exceeded all In wickedness, di'de Crimson in the blood Of's Predicessour who was not ore good Put out the Eyes and in his cruelty Of John a Cardinall: whose cruelties Return upon him, down he suddenly Fell by Death's axe. His Carkass out they high Into the open Street as Carion,'s Spew'd And Stobd by Spears, and Swords by all men rude. The fifteenth John is caught, and they out put His eyes and famish in the Prison Shut. The Sixteenth John by hunger too doth die As he a jayle bird did in prison lie John Placentine Crescentiu's pope his foes Put out his Eyes, Cut off his Ears, and nose Strip of his Dignities, and headlong cast Him from the Capitall down down at last. Crescence they on a base Steed in disgrace With face towards its taile in Scorn do place. And carry round the City, then they pare By little off, and little (oh hard fare) His members: and before the Citie Wall Do hang him up in Gibbets seen of all. And thus we se what mercys now reside In Pope's rich Miters as they're Petrifide For though the Finger of bright Justice's here Yet Patience groans under such Cruell geer. But take an instance now or two I pray Of other Sort that here I shall display Mistave the Vandall King with aide did goe With Bernard Duke of Saxony into Calabria, and pleasd him there so much That he his daughter promisd him though Such. Where at the Marquess brave of Branden burgh Replied so as did the Promise Curb A maid so noble ought not to be gi'n Unto a Dog, a Pagan. Oh! this thing Breaking the neck thereof. Mistave out brake Upon the Christians: Cruell work did make At Aldenburgh he Sixty priests did slay Whose Skin he in Such Sort did Cut and flay Like to the Cross of Christ upon: their head Thrusting the knife full deep: and thus them led About, and loaded them with Scorns and Stripes Untill they breath their last by Such hard gripes. And cut the throats of many Canons too After Such Sort as butchers fatware doe At Hamburgh too Such Cruell Cruelty He also usd. And in Such sort did fly On them at Brandenburgh and Havelbergh. His Cruelty in horrid acts out flurd. Mary of Arrogon the Emperess Of Otho, third, a Cask of Lust did dress A Sparkling blade in Womenly array To Serve her filthy lust even day by day. At length the bird is Cought and burnt alive Yet Otho Spares his Yolly to Survive. She goes to Kick again, allures also An Earle to tup her, Which he will not do. Its grand abuse unto the Emperour. To whom shee goes (Oh! cursed flatterer) And doth Complain, as if this Earle so just, Would violently force her to his Lust. The Emperour hereat enrag'd, commands And off his head doth fly. No man withstands. The mournfull Countess to the Court doth goe, When Otho was himselfe therein. Would know What punishment he did deserve to 'bide Who hangs an Innocent, his Case not tride? He ought, saith Otho, to be hangd indeed. To whom the Countess: answer did proceed Thou art this judge thyselfe, Oh! Cesar bright! Who didst my righteous husbands head off Smite, Not trying of his Case. Which thing most true She would, she said, by fire Ordeall Shew. Otho amaizd, the matter out did search And finds his Mollie's pranks. She now hath burch. He Charges that she should be burnd in fire And openly. Her lust shall Swell no higher. Although here's brightsom Justice Streaming in These Instances, yet Cruelty, the thing Did hatch and bruddle up, in such a way That Patience doth most glorioulsy display By these and other such as these, that rise, Se Patience spread her glorious Exercise Through out this Century, and at this stile We Shaking hands, do leave her for a while. The Shine of Divine Justice. Wellcome Sweet Justice, almost flown away Into the other world, but here I Stay To gaze upon thy Star, as it doth Strike Its beams through out this age, as darke as night. Which gathering up, in Sheaves, I'le binde and shock The Gloyr of thy harvest to unlock. In the Reigns of the Emperours West. as Lewis 3.901 to ? East as Alexander to 9 ?? Constantine to 9 ? 901God plagues this wicked age, great judgments rage, The Hungars do in furious Sort ingage Moravy and Bavar: Lewis at first Hews down a thousand of them: yet the worst Fell to his Share at last, when he fell then Unto his routing in their Stratagem Bavary, Sweve, France, Saxony Sustain Now Slaughters, Rapins. Fire and Sword Grief Pain. The Saracens from Africk leape into Proude Italy, Calabria over flow Apulia too: Galerian Mount possess. Poore Italy now Soaks in greate distress. King Zwendebald the Son of Arnulph lies A bleeding by the Lotharingys boyes. Then Lewis did obtain his realm for his. And Albert Earle of Bamberg out did hiss 'Gainst Conrad Earle of East France who had killd His brother. And the like cup to him filld. Albert for three Whole dayes did havock make Of th'Country nigh to Wirtzburgh, and did take Great plunder home. The Emperour at this Offended was. And he indited is. But Albert will not stand unto the Court. But flies to arms a Seven years war up bore't. But through entreatie he Confides unto Lewis his trust. And off his head did go. Now Berengary Duke of Foriojule And other Longbards Princes fain would rule Ore France, and plot attempts; which broken are And then did bend his heate, and other fare Gainst Italy. And is a griveous plague But Lewis at Verona quells this blade Puts out his eyes, Cuts off his genitalls[.] Tyrants a while may rage. Yet God them quells. Constantinoples Constantine a Child But Seven years long, his Guardian him Spoild, Romanus namd, Sits in th'Imperiall throne, Himselfe, and doth Augustify his own. Poor Constantine a painters life attends But Justice stirs herselfe and makes amends For Stephen Now Romanu's Son rose like As Cuckcows do their dam, his dad did shike Him banisht, and empend in Protee Ile. A Shavling poor, and ravages a While. Now Constantine him and his brother feasts And while they strove for th'Upper Seat them ceist And Shav'de, Exild Stephen to Mitylene And Constantine to Samothrace, the Scene Now come again to this right Constantine Whom vile Romanus basely did out twine. Thus Justice grindes upon this Grindle stone Her Edg-toole bright: that such hath overthrown. Under Emperours of the West as Conrade. 913 to 9?? Henry. 920 to 937 East as before and Romanus 913Conrade now wares imperiall Bayes indeed. Another Prince a Winter keen succeeds. Now Hatto Mentz Arch bishop down did fall And Divells did, its said, his Carkass hall And headlong hurle int' Etna'es fiery maw. Now pay is made him, for his guilfull law Whereby the Marquess Adelbert did lose His head: and who did seek by wiles to close Duke Henry of Saxony with Death But Justice now sees meet to Stop his breath. Hungarians harrass Alman, but are bangd. 915But soon return and with an horrid hand Do Alman Spoile, Thuringe and Saxony. The German Princes in the mean time fly Together by the Ears. The Hungar hence Laugh in their Sleevs, a new attempt Commence[,] Alman, and Alsace do depopulate But Conrade making with them peace, the fate Falls on the German Princes, off thereby The Heads of Eringer and Berthold fly, Brethren unto the Lotharingian Duke. Arnulphiut of Bavaria too is shooke. But Henry Duke of Saxony more wise, And Potent is greate terrour in their eyes. Conrade sets Hatto as his Mousetrap, who Provides a Golden halter that must do The Worthy Deed: and with a Sigh thus told Unto the Goldsmith, that this Wreath of gold Shall deadly bee unto Duke Henry. To whom the Goldsmith shew'd it Secretly When Henry gave a visit Hatto too, Hence Henry said Well let the traitor know His neck not harder is than Alberts was. And ceisd all that in Thuringy and Hass Was Hatto's. But Conrade to arms now flew. And nigh to Hartsburgh the Stout Saxons slew, Such numbers of the French, that Stage men would In scorn say Where is there an hell that could Receive such multitudes of Slaughter'd men. 920Soon after this Conrade his Diadem Surrendred up to Henry the Wise Calld also Fowler. But Arnulph back highs Into Bavaria the Empire claims. To whom Wise Henry the Case explains Ev'n thus. I ceizd not on the Emperiall Strand: But Eberhard by Conrades Strict Commands Deliveres it to mee, and all his Pears Gave their Consent (By me Kings reign we heare) Now if the Peers Choose Arnulph Emperour I'le freely yield Subjection. Banish war. This Conquourd Arnulph, he doth Subject ly. Another Berengare fangs Italy[.] War Flames ore France tween Ratbertus and Charles Ratbert is routed. But now Henry Snarls. Charles met him, and himselfe and France Subject And Sent Saint Denyse's hand most neatly deckt And Set inclosd in Gold with Gems most bright. Hence Henry pacifide no Stroke did Strike 923But Charles prooves false, on Alsace, unto Worms Invasion makes. Hence Henry on him turns. Him routs, and taketh Metz. At Bon they make 924Peace once again. The Hungars out do brake Claw Italy. Earle Herbert captive made King Charles and him in Paro prison laid 926Wherein he dies: because his Sword had slain His brother Ratbert. Hungars out again Wast France, Alsace, Gaul, Almain, Cesar rose Against the Sclaves: and doth their hold Enclose Of Brandeburgh in Winter time so cold Their tents were pitcht in ice. And in this hold He conquours them by Famin, Cold, and Sword. Then did Dalmace's Grone and Gana board. 928And made Bohemy tributary: nay 933Did more than forty thousand Hungars slay In Saxony. And them in Thuringe rout: The Danes Subdue and Conquour round about. Romanus Son of Constantine in th'East His mother, and his Sisters dispossest And from the Palace Chast, who in their griefe Their Bodies prostitute for mony briefe. Under the Emperours West as Otho. 1. from 938 to 9?? East as Otho the first is Crownd at Aquisgrane Arnulphs proud Sons with arms his deeds disdain Cause he had dubd their brother Bertold, Duke. And they the title Earles Provinciall took. He curbs them, yet Tanquard his batterd brother Did ceize upon while this great dust did pother, The Marquisate of Brandeburgh by force To whom Duke Eberhard made his recourse. And Henry, Otho's brother in they twinde Duke Giselbert of Lotharinge too joynd. But Otho's man at Hartzburge Tanquard Slew And soon in war he dasht the other too Yet in this juncture Lewis King of France Assaults Alsace. And's back soon made to prance, Bohemy now rebells full fourteen years The Hungars Austria, and Alman's fears Depoplate. At Worms slip ore the Rhene And Gaul and Burgundy make their Sad Scene And back return through Italy. Now Hugh The Earle of Paris for the Throne doth sue. And swells too for th'Emperiall Majesty But Otho cuts his Comb: makes Lewis joy. The Hungars rush on Italy again Wast Capua, Benevent, and Nola Stain. Great Hugh in Italy doth tyrannize But Berengary's Son Albert did rise Gains Otho's aide against him tooke him down The Russi send a Fleet to gain the town Constantinople but Romanus turns And with his Wild fire soon that navy burns. The Saracen envade do Italy And Hugh with Wild fire did their fleet annoy. But feare of Berengary turns the Scales. Who now in Italy Strangly prevails. Otho is Calld and comes: and breaks the yoake And marri'd Lothairs Widdow. Hence out broke A war between the Father and the Son Ludolph against his Father Otho run. At Mentz with Bishop there they flock together To Ludolph who are chased by his Father. He highs to Ratisbone, is there hemd in And all reliefe him faild. The Son to Win His Fathers heart out barefoot goes unto His Father, and with tears in's eyes that flow, Fell on his knees and begs forgiveness, and The Father pardons all: a tenter hand. The Hungars that his Coast did harrass, hee Subdu'de nigh to Augusta, mightilie. Now Italy the Cream of all the Pest, Doth Smart indeed, by Berengary prest. Otho relieves. But treacherous she Revolts. He doth her Seige, till famine for her faults So grips her that mans flesh she's glad to eate She forc'd to yield, and all is heald compleat. She then revolts again. And now he comes And thirteen rebells hangs and so them bombs. And Theophane Daughter in Law unto Th'East Emperour Nicephorus did so Obtain to be a bride unto his Son. And Sent his host to bring her bravely home. The Greeks displeasd here at, rise, slay and take Them Captive to Constantinople's Gate[.] Otho enrag'd did claw Apuleia 973Calabria too and made them tribute pay And thus we finde a wicked age persu'de By woe the Hue, and Cry Justice renewd. The Eastern Countries Sweat with Turkish wars. Gods Justice executes revenge by jars[.] Under Emperours East John Zimisce after the Sons of Romanus West as Otho 2d from 974 to 983 974Otho the Second wares th'Emperiall Wreath. His Uncle Henry here at doth grieve, Prompt on by Abraham his Bishop, and Kings of Beheme, Polone, and Denmarks band With him against this Otho and are queld. The French that Lotharinge ceiz'd are expelld. Otho at Aquisgrane was nigh entrapt, But scaping, Lothair by him was so strapt As that he loses all he had, Otho With fire, and Sword did unto Paris go But turning home the River Ailene stroy'd His men abundantly by its Swift tide. 980Basil, and Constantine. Romanu's Sons Pufft with their Syrian Victorie their drums Beat up 'gainst Otho torn with Civill Wars Snatch Dorus up: Machera gain make Scars In Apuleia and Calabria Out Otho came against them ways to pay But them of Benevent, and Rome in fight Proove treacherous when he'd nigh the Greeks quelld [quite] That Otho scarce escapt the Foes: but fell Into the Seamens hands, and by a Spell Of Silver did redeem himselfe and free Feigning himselfe another man to bee, But now requoils. and Beneventum burns And punishment on Romans he returns[.] After Nicephorus John Zimiscee Who him destroy'd the Emperour must bee Whom yet the Patriarch refusd to Crown In that his Masters blood by him fell down. The Turks molest him: he them Swaddled well And in's return, his eyes beholding fell Upon the booty brave the Eunuch had Was heard to say, it is a thing full sad A Stallion Should such goods have in his den Wonn by the blood of many noble men. This Speech inflam'd the Eunuch's wrath, that he Must by a mess of poison welcombd bee. Now Justice hath her glory pollisht bright, Wherein her balance Stands with Equall Weights. Under the East Emperours as Basill. Constantine. West Otho 3. from 984 to Constantinople hath Nicephorus With Whom Romanu's Sons are Consorts thus. Hence when Nicephorus is laid aside The Brethren do the Empire onely guide. Schlerus rebells but Basill Cracks his Crown. Yet the Bulgarian war spoild his renown. Asia, Iberia, Phaenice too make worke For him indeed, and Egypts Prince off shurks His League with him and spoild the temple, and The Abby at Jerusalem up man'd. Basill turns to his dust, and Constantine In belly buried is, With Cups of Wine Resignd his Empire with his Daughter to Romanus. And soon to his grave did go[.] ??4Otho the third the Western Wreath did gain. Is Crowned Emperour at Aquisgrane. And for the Wisdom that in him's up laid He's Styld the WONDERS of the World, its said. Bohemie's war his hansill prooves: they feel His metall is not lead; but perfect Steel. Crescentius would be Chiefe at Rome but hee Doth take him down. He crows again: Would be Upon the Throne. Otho then come[s] again Takes Rome: yet tender is to this harebrain. And back return[s], Crescentius up arose Again, as dunghill Cock, claps Wings and crows. Otho again returns with force and takes The Roost, and roost Cocks, and their necks he brakes. The treacherous Romans have so little faith He could not trust them: Hence no heart he hath To venter home. But Crescentiu's Wife Attempts his Love to be his bride's her Strife. Which when she found her aime to miss she sends 1002Him poison'd Gloves which brought him to his end. And thus we See Sins go before, and Call And judgments follow after from the Hall Where Justice Keeps her Court in glorious Wise, Which Shatter do the Clouds to shew her eyes Her beaming glory radient with shines Of which more Still Efficiency defines[.] The Shine of Divine Efficiency. Divine Efficiency puts up her Head In glorious Shew through this Whole Century. And in her Folds rich Justice Cherished Comes Sparkling forth, that all men may it eye. Some Instances hereof I now shall name. That God may have the Honour of the same. 904A blazing Star in May did go before Greate Slaughter made in Italy. Lewis beates Berengary, he more ore Beats Lewis: takes and puteth out his eyes. 912Another Shines more red than usually. Great Inundations flow in Saxony. Now Fiery Faggots Sparkling Wandring Stars In divers places peare. The Saxon realm Devoures the Franks. And the Hungarian jars Wast Italy. Where treason gat at helm. To Lewis Emperour a monstrous thing, Like to a man with a Dogs head they bring. 930In the reign of Lewis Son to Charles the Foole, An army in the aire of burning men Were fighting seen and killing oh! strange rule And noise of men and troops were heard too then. Treachery in France ensu'd: and Famine found Corn by the Sestarce fetcht twenty four pound. 935Soon after this it rained blood, they say At Genua flows a Well Spring of blood The Saracens the Citty wast did lay 937The Sun too in a bright Sky bloody stood, Its beams through windows such, and many dayes Bloods seen to flow out of the Sun, like rayes[.] 942A Comet in November Shines. And soon Greate Inundations and mortality. 944An Earth Quake now, and Sun eclipst is shewn A fiery Comet hangs ore Italy. A dismall famine follow'd and in France Famin and War the following yeare made prance. 947An hard and Snowy Winter now did come. The entrance of November led untill The tenth of March in Poland. And a Stone Or thunder bold the thundering Clouds did spill Like to a Mass of red hot iron most vast, Amazing the beholders as it passt. The Earth in France, and Germany doth dance And many temples overturn thereby. 956He Priests, and Shees are smit by Heavens lance And horrid Signes appeare tremendously. A Cruell winter; famine follows sore In France and Burgundy. Now farewell Store. Two Suns are seen. Sea Waters sweet do flow From Naples unto Cuma two whole dayes. ??9Croses are in mens robes: Some blood like show. Some Robes like leprosy are staind, these wayes. Greate Famine rag'd, and Conflagration, when The Empire was Romanu's Lacupen. They bring out of Armenia unto Constantinoble two young men that grew Together, which one Dead, Physitians do Cut from the other: and no ills accrew To him alive, who did not long abide After his brother, dead, before he dide. 968The Earth doth Quake. A blazing Star out flies. The Sun doth wink, a famine Sore succeeds. Hatto Mentz Bishop pens great Companie Of Poor ins barn as if for good Alms deeds. Sets all on fire, and when in flames they cri'de, They're Mice that eate the Corn, this Priest replide. But marke the End. Soon mice in troops assaile To eate him up both night, and day. He flies On to a Tower in th'Rhene, they ore do traile Swiming those Streams, and Scale the tower, their Prize The Bishop is. He is the Corn they eate And kill him thus. His tower could not them cheat. They know his name out of the Walls thus writ. This tower doth Stand my Authors all so say Still in the Rhene and bears the name as yet 969Of Hatto's Tower. And lo this murine fray Was in the third yeare of his Bishopdom Justice comes surely though she slow doth come. A Dreadfull Earth Quake Shatters many towns Constantinople too, and burning gailes The Fruits destroy, a Dismall Famine frowns. Whereby Nicephorus did fill his Sayles With Silver blasts selling at such a rate The Store of bread corn gatherd up a late. Before the Emperour calld Constantine Gave up the ghost for certain nights there flew Stones 'gainst his Chamber. He them did assigne To humane hands, hence when his Watch did shew That no man threw them, it concluded was An hand Divine these clattring stones made pass[.] 976A dismall frost September brings that lasts Till March halfe gone, a blazing Star appears. 979Yea fiery armies all night fighting Wast And wound each other. Otho war uprears Against the Greeks: and's almost Conquoured 983A Famine ery where's nigh overspred. An Earth Quake Stroys houses at Capua: And fifteen towers with sevenscore men, and ten At Benevent: part too of Arian, nay And Fr?nt: and halfe Compane Cities, when At Ronsa nigh with its inhabitants Was overturnd, it routs them and decamps. In winter frequent inundations: and Great Gusts of Winde much building overthrows, Great droughts the Seeds time of the Spring disbande The Vehement burning Summer over flows. A grievous famine follows. Snows and Rain Unseasonable, Autumns Seedstime baine. And now about it rains out of the Skie Bread Corn a pace in Albany, its said, With little Fishes too in Saxony Which yet were not for humane food display'd They did so Stinck. God can, did hee see good Make fields and Fish pools in the Sky yield foode. 991Fire flames out of the Water. Rhenes swift Streams Sende fire out of their bowells that burn down Adjacent Villages. The next year gleams Wherein the God of heaven gives his Frown. Three times by night the Heavens seem to bee All bloody, if my authour fails not mee. 993A Sudden Light out of the north Coast Shine[s] By night about the first Cock Crow so cleare A man would think it noone day bright and prime About an hour which then did disappeare, Leaving a ruddy Colour in the Skie And so the night returnd as usually. 994Novembers birth a winter keen begins Stretcht out till May. Scarce one warm day then's found Cold cruell Winds sharp blowing hard on things That Ponds and Rivers with hard ice are bound In th'End of June. And fishes there destroyd Trees, Fruits, and Pastures, as with fire, are dri'de. Waters are Scarce fit for mans use, out runs A dreadfull Plague and Famine laying wast All Sorts of men and beasts which none can shun And many houses by it quite out racde. A Comet flames from thence and Mice devour 996Argentines Bishop Wild'rolph O Sad hour[.] 997In th'Contrey neer to Halberstad was spewd A babe without both Legs and Genitalls, Whose back parts sharp like naked young birds stood, Whose right side far the Eye and Eare extalls Above its left, had yellow teeth too and A left hand thumb, no fingers nor right hand. 999A Dreadfull Earth Quake and a blazing Star The world do waken: this at nine a clock. And fiery faggot like with a long bar Shining like Lightning onto earth, that knock Did such within Doores and without doores too Like lightening that very swiftly flew. This gash in heaven vanishing appears As 'twere a Serpent on whose head did grow Cleare blewish feet: And afterwards there were Two balls of burning fire the heavens out th[row.] One fell at Magdeburgh: the other fell Beyond the River Alt as storys tell. And thus we se Divine Efficiency To ware a glory bright this age quite through By Wonders done, and Justice shines hereby In many things. And now we pass ito view Another glory, so to render praise To him who glorious Rayes ran through these d[ays.] The Shine of Divine Truth. Sweet Truth I now get ore thy Garden Stile To View thy flowers in their bright Shine To Smell the Sweet Perfumes, thy Soile With Rosy breaths holds thine. Thou sayst, a King after his Will should do[.] Its here fulfilld: these new fac'd Kings Of Peters Chair act all things to Mentain their Wills, and Sins. Their Wills, and Pleasures are their Rule to which Their Actions Square. And others must Thereto their operations pitch Or Smart. Unjust, or just. Thou saist, he Will himselfe too magnify Above each God. It's just so here. O're Kings and Emperours doth fly. He goddeth Peters Chair. Thou saist He'l speake things mervelous against The God of Gods. The Popes so speake. By Peter, Cross and Nailes (Strange Paints) They Sweare. And thee unseate. Thou saist, he cares not for his Fathers God. These Cursed things this verify. With Peters Lord they play the lob And of him make a toy. Thou saist, he minds not Women Chiefe Desire. This thing is true in these strange Dons. They Holy Wedlock make dirt, mire. Ban it from Sacred ones[.] Thou saist, He Serves With Silver, Gold, Choice Stones And pleasant things his Upstart God. This Popish Crew take rotten bones And serve them thus, thus shod. Charles King of France sent Henry Auceps Such Saint Denyse his hand set in gold With pretious Gems, that weighed much, As authours have us told. Popes deify do Relicks, and translate From place to place, as if they were Some Godheads, to keep safe from fate Fire, Sword or Foes though neer. Odo brought from Northumber Wilfrides dust To Canterbury, now they take Up Dead mens bones and do them thrust In Golden Chests they make. Urseol Duke of Venice brouht into A new built Vault the Corps unburnd Of the Evangelist although A fire upon it turnd. And did a golden table dedicate Of neate grecanick Workt indeed Before the Altar of greate State. (Oh Superstitious breed) Pope John the Sixteenth built Saint John's Church new Painted its Wall egregiously. Pav'de 'fore Saints Benits Altar too With Stones brave variously He beautifide the Altar place most gay With Silver Tables in its ring. Johns Altar too did overlay With Silver oh! brave king. He made a Silver Cross Orelaid with gold. And th'Book of th'Gospell ery where Broider'd With Silver, guilt, enrowld With Gold and Gems full deere. Three Silver Crowns, and Cal[i]ces he made Censars, and various ornaments. Codes very many and such trade To which his pleasure bent. To such fine golden Gods their prayers do go. Henry falls prostrate down before Saint Denyses brave hand and so It kiss did, and adore. Thou saist, He shall encrease in glory. Rule. We see the same is verifide In this good race. For Kings they foole And ore their Heads do ride. Popes rule the Empire and in Germany Have fixt it, its Succession broke. They must be chosen by and by Then Crowned by the Pope. Greg'ry the fift Electors makes that shall Choose him that Emperour shall bee. Mentz, Triers, Colons Bishops tall These are Electors three. The Marquess Brandenburgh, Count Palatine Of Rhene, and Duke of Saxony And the Bohemian King define Th'Imperiall Magisty. And when these Seven have the Person chose His Holiness must Crown his head. And then he Emperour out goes. When thus Augustused. And as they thus the Empire do up mould. So also do they novice Kings[.] Pope John the 'leventh's peale so bold 'Gainst brave King Edward rings. Alberick Marquess of Hetruria He doth expell from Rome in pride. King Edgar Dunstan made to stay And Seven Years Shame abide. Stephen King of the Hungars bowed when The Pope of Rome was ever nam'de. And would have others do these men Such honours. So he aim'd. But how these Birds attained to this Hight The Holy Worde doth to us shew Kings give their power their Strength and might Unto him. This is true. The Kings, and Nobles do advance this Realm. King Edgar Abbies more did build, Than forty: and their Shining Helm His royall Wealth upheld. And other Nobles all the World o're wide Their riches spent in Such away. And Relicks raisd a Silver tide Into their greedy bay. Henry the Emperour did promise much For th'Speare which gasht Christs blessed side Wherein was set a naile (Why Such?) That naild him Crucifide. And when he had it got he did bestow For it much Silver too and gold Nay and great part of Swevland too Oh! costly bought, and sold. Beside, Kings do them in the Saddle keep And Emperours do, do the Same. The Othoes ran (and did not creep) Them wholy to Sustain. Otho gave Verda's Bishops in their Names Markets and Mony minting Rights Hunting Harts and fowles such games Of Nobles for delights And pearched thus on high these Cocks grow bold, Crow o're Kings heads of tallest Sise Their hand a golden Cap doth hold Filld with Impieties. But yet not filld unto the brim, their Jacks Are pouring out more draughts to drinck: Sergy the third his Hogs head wracks And Candlemass drops in't. Elphegus Bishop once of Winchester Did Spirits drop of Ember dayes. Baptising bells with names in't flurs From John the fourteenths blaze. But Dunstans brain is milch, these Strappings fall Through his rich Nose into this bowle Of Kyre 'sleeson learnd all Of Angells at FA SOL. Odila did the holy day up raise Of all Departed, to its brim Pope John the Sixteenth to his praise Thence made it plump therein. They fill it up with Consecrated things Staffs, Robes, Salts, Ashes, Water, Grease, Wax, Spices, Places, Buildings, Rings, And Such things as they please. And of this Cup must all men drinck or they Will Smite them with their thunderbolts. Kings shall not to this Cup say nay. Its Alberry too for Dolts. The Locusts in the Eggs and new hatcht bubs Bare, and pen fether'd late that lay, Fill ev'ry place that hell's Smoake dubs They fly abroad, and Sway. And thus we see how Truth doth clearely shine, When Smootherd out in these darke times, By her Pole Star to Steer our line The Skies fogd with thick Rimes. And now I pass having thus come to Spie The Shine of Grace allthough but dim Of Patience bright, and Justice high That doth adorn our king. And of Efficiency in Sparkling Rayes And Blessed Truth, when truths defac'de. Unto our Lords erelasting praise His Wayes disgrac'd are grac'd. The 'Leventh Age, which blake and blew appears Cudgeld to Gelly by her perblind Seers Whose Crossiers Staffs Club arguments do rise, Herculian Clubs) not Aron's Rod, and Sise With Stygian Darkness ery Stripe they make Dawns on a pace. Whose dayes a Maske up take In Superstitions Blew pot Di'de, and tand Whose Doctors with their Cat-a-nine tailes stand Like persons whipping of an Ape. Yet not With Peters Angle Rod, but with a knot Of Wired Cruelties that Stains the glory Of this Soure Age portrayed in our Story. But now I come to Search the Stars that Shine In this dark night, of Attributes Divine Carbuncle like, in Beams of Grace most bright Of Patience, Justice, Wonder Working Might And Holy Truth, that so Gods blessed praise May glorify his Realm these glouting dayes. The Shine of Divine Grace. Oh! Blessed Gospell, Lanthorn of blesst Light. Thy Candle flame's not blown yet from thy wick. Though Hellish Fogs so mud the aire, mens Sight Is muffled much thereby and made so thick That Blindman's Buff most Suites the Candlestick. Yet blesst be God the Gospell Still hath ground Though made a Spell for golden Spirits, nay, And Shining lights although few pens have found Them for us. But blinde Lights before us lay, Being possesst by th' Spirit of their day. Unless Some person in Some Shineing place Did with his inke be black the Papall Shine That Stirs arose, Historick Pens no trace Do take thereof, and when they do define These men, their pens poke malice on their Shr[ine] Angiers Arch Deacon Berengarius He Was Such an One, that Stoutly did oppose Romes Errour of the Supper, and wee See They him Supplaint, poor man, amongst Such foes That he recants, yet Conscience cannot close. Upon his Dying day he said to day Our Lord Christ Jesus when he shall appeare Will then to me for my repenting way Appeare I hope to glory shining cleare. Or for the sake of others, t'pain I feare. But to go on, when now Romes Canons had The bullet made of Divells Doctrine flung Against a marri'd Ministry as bad The Clergy all in England, France up sprung And Germany, and threw it off as dung. And though their Bishops did promote this Sin Thundring against them, they of Germany At Erford Synod, thought reward to bring To Mentz Archbishop with black Desteny: For an Example of Such Vilany. I will no longer here detain my quill But call you to attend for further glory Of Grace, it in its progress where it will In Patience's bright Honour lay before ye Her Shine commixt with hers, in shining Story. The Shine of Divine Patience. Patience Divine, to admiration will In this dark Pitchy night of filthy ill Shine like the glorious Sun with Sparkling Ray[es] For to adore the Song sung to Gods prayse And on the Sign Posts, where engraven stand Prelatick Wickedness, Strange Worship, and Apostasy, Rebellion, Cruelty, Patience's Glory doth imbellisht ly. Prelatick Wickedness. How Greate is Patience made, while such a Crew Of Wretched Prelates of Such monstrous hew And Hellish Wickedness do reeck in Sin. And huff in daring Vilany, and Sing. The Rabble of the Popes of Rome relates That Patience in her glory on them waits. Pope John the nineteenth hath Sylvesters Chair Ordains next All Saints, All-Souls day, did tare From men of Rome their Pope Electing right. And by a Cup of Poison bids good night The twentieth John ascends the Papall glory A monkie friend, is poisond as Some Story. Sergy the fourth comes in of better fame. Then Benit Eighth up to the Popedom came Theophylact his Newphew Scholar to Pope Sylvester the Witch, by Witchcraft so Did hoise him thither. And he did bestem King Henry with th' Imperiall Diadem. After whose reign the Cardinalls up rise And unpope Benit, pope another prize. But this old Fox his adversaries took Not with Saint Peters Net, but golden hook. And outs his Antipope, popes it again In pomp untill grim death did ore him reign. Out of whose Lordship on a black horse hee Unto a Bishop, his old friend in glee, Did soon appeare, lamenting all in teares Under hells torments, bidding him (Heark Eares) Charge his Successour, take the gold up, hid In Such a place, it from its Coffer rid, And give it to the poore, and so this pope From all his torments, should escape, did hope. Here is fine News. Popes paddle do in Hell, It seems as well as other knaves: they tell. Onely this grace the divell shews them, hee Their hacknie steed to ride upon, will bee. The One and twentieth John then up arose To Peters Chair by Witchcraft, (men disclose) Now almost all things in the Church of Rome, Are Spiders Webs, wove in a Magick loome. Theophylact the Wizzard, now up came And they this pope Benit the ninth did name. A laizie lubber, by inchantments brought What women pleasd his Will, to's lust: all naught. He did assume a power to make whom ere He pleased Emperour, what pride his here? When Conrade's head was laid, he then would bring Th' Imperiall Crown to the Hungarian King To whom he sent a Crown thus do'tcht all down The Rock gave Peter Rome, th' Pope thee a Crown. His Cruelty was such, the Romans rose And out this Benit, In John Sabine goes And Styles himselfe Sylvester. Benit will Not suffer this, but flies to arms, and's skill. And in the fortieth day of's Popedome drive Him doth from th' Lateran unto his hive In Peters Chappell; where by force and arms He did defend his Dignity from harms. And Carri'de on his Popedom Rites in Spite Of Benits beard, and his Magician might. But Benit reinstalld, grew jealous lest An after Clan should him again molest Joynd with him in his Popedom pains one John A Priest, or an Arch deacon who came on And bought of Benit for himselfe alone The Popedom office (Symony ore grown) For fifteen hunderd pound of gold down fixt And styles himselfe by name Greg'ry the Sixt. And Benit in the Lateran Palace rowles In Luxury, and pleasures on whose Shoales He Splits his Barge. And that black Demon grim [1]047He usd, did in the Woods there Stifle him. Who after ward appeard in horrid Sight Nigh to a grist Mill to an Eremite, In Body like a bare in head, and taile Like to an Ass, because he did so faile In living in his Popedom like a lob Without, both Reason, Law, and also God, Contemperate with Benit rose that John The peoples pope. Sylvester tersh, comes on. The Church is made a Shambles, blood, and slaughter Do fill its Stalls. This makes the Old boy Laughter. [10]45The Emperour him outs from Peters hive John Gratian the Magician arch did thrive In Benits Love for Magicks Sake, did rise Romes golden head, of Symon Magu's Sise. A Sorcerer, a Symonist, and one Savagely Cruell, kickt is from his throne, Is this the Romish Headship? Is thy Church, Proud Rome, thus Hydra like? Go go and search Pluto's darke Region. For't will parallell Three Headed Cerberus the Dog of Hell. Th' Imperiall Club strikes off these Hydra Heads 1046Clement the leventh Peters Chair then treds. Th' Imperiall Diadem he on the Crown Of Henry the third set with renown. The Emperour did Sweare the Romans to Elect no Pope without his leave they know. But oaths in Italy are feeble things When Henry's gone, they feare no hempen Strings. Hence Gerard Brazute gave this Pope a Drench. And Peters Chair him pukt into his trench. Stephen his Chancellar without the vote Of Folk, or Clergy, takes this Chaire of note Yea vi et armis: Damasus the Second He writes himselfe, when twenty dayes are reckon'd Then from his trust he like a trevant slinks When he the Health of Brazute's Spic'd cup drinks. The Emperour gone home Pope Benit now To animate his Headship Steels his brow His Conjures yet do fail him Bruno brave Of Alsace, Earle of Dagsburgh, Bishop grave Of Tulsa Church's sent by the Emperour And Chosen by the Romans who Confer The Popedom on him. Leo Ninth he's calld. But Hildebrand hereat was greatly galld. But he by Hellbrands Counsill and advice Of base Theophylact both Swords did hoise Against the Normans, and is Captive took Theophylact his privy Counsill Shook And did it to the foe Convay by wiles. But when the Normans, who had gave him foiles, Set him at liberty. Helbrands deare friend Brazute mixt him a drench that did him end. 1054The Dead head Benit now again doth strive To leap upon the Body and revive And on the Shoulders whence it Severd was It once did sit while months Eleven pass. 1056But Gebhard kinsman to the Emperour Is popifi'de and nam'd the Conquerour i e Victor. He in the Counsill at Florentia chases The Marri'de Bishops from their Office places. But as his Choice slit Hildebrands wide nose, So Brazute's Wassell bowle him over throws. Frederick Duke Goth'lens Son of Lotharinges Upon the Hobbihorses backe ascends. And's Styled Stephen Ninth. Millain he breaks Off from her freedom, and his Subject makes. He did Condemn the Emperour because He authorizd the Clergy 'gainst popes laws. But in the Synod held at Florence gay, 1058He dranke of Brazute's Cup and goes away. Benit the tenth Succeeds against the Will Of Hildebrand, who mischiefe worketh Still. Who durst not for the furious folk, in Rome To choose and make another pope presume But flies to Siena, and Gerard Chose Who by the Name of Niclas th' Second goes. And Benits popeship of a nine months Station Is by him left for's former occupation Niclas thus chose at Sutrium he calls 1059A Synod and Benit unpopes, and Crawls To Rome, dethrones Bogellard from his Relm Sets Robert the Calabrian Duke at's helm. Ordains that Popes be Chose by th' Cardinalls: All Chose by others he rejects and malls. Did curb by Sword the folk of Prenestee Of Tuscany Numentum they obey. And did destroy Galera, Castles all Of greate Earle Gerhards on to Sutriums wall. But having hufft it in his glory, bibs 1063Of Brazute Cup and from his glory trigs. The Second Alexander now comes in Without the Emperours advice, this thing The Lombard kicke at, the Emperour they treate And by his leave the Basill Counsills heate Chose the Permensine Bishop Cadolus. And now two Popes in Peters Chaire do Crush, Together by the eares they Go, hereby A multitude on both sides dead do ly. Anshelm nam'd Alexander wins the field. But Cadolus will not the Popedom yield. Hence both do play the Pope at once, and Cry Against each other, as th' Church Enemy. At length the Schism is at Mantua By much adoe Composd. So ends the fray. Here Alexander did deprive of place All Marri'd Bishops, Priests and Deacons. Chast Ordain that Popes be onely chosen by The Cardinalls, yet when by Craft his eye Discernd he chose without the approbation Of th' Emperour was, he in his set oration Professt he would not Sit in Peters Chair Without Emperiall licence, saying there He letters to the Emperour did hand For his good favour. This galld Hildebrand That he could hardly hold his hands off till Mass over was. Which ended his rag'd Will Brake out upon the Pope he on him flew And from the Altar to the Arch him drew: And with his fists did sorely buffit him While in his Papall Garments he was in. Reviling him for Seeking Cesars grace. And Cast him in the jayle (a noble place) Allowing him but fivpence Lucensine A day for his Support, (a royall Coine) And ceised all the Churches revenues Oh! Cursed Hildebrand. But still ensues Poor Alexanders Death, which is Supposd To be by Poison, that his dayes up closd. 1074Now Hildebrand a firebrand from Hell A blacksmith's Son, that others did excell In Vilany, ascends the Headship bright By bribery, by Witchcraft, and by Might Chose not by Citizens, nor Clergy but By Soldiers, and in Peters throne is put 'Fore Alexanders Corps interment have Who to the Abbot of Cassina gave This Scoff that came to be Elected, brother Thou fingeredst too much. To whom the other Replid, thou Hildebrand, mad'st too much hast Who 'fore the Pope dead in his grave is cast Contrary to the Canon Laws art flown Usurping thus th' Apostle Peters Throne. Greg'ry the Seventh he is nam'd. And was A Wicked Sorcerer, who as he pass Did on a time from Albane unto Rome And left his Conjuring booke behind did soon Two of his Servants makes run back a pace And fetch it, charging them much of their grace Not to looke in't. Which made their mouths to water Hence coming with it (Cowerds cannot Vaper) They it unclasp, and read the black Art Law And Soon an host of Divells black they saw. That thus salute them, Why have you us Calld? Why have you weari'd us? are we on balld? What will you have us do? Soon bid us plain. We'l fall on you, if you us long detain. The youths well nigh out of their Wits agast: One of them getting heart replies at last Saith pointing with his hands to Walk nigh Rome, Cast down these walk and down they fling them soon. The youths then Crossing of themselves be took Them panting, and amaizd to give the booke Unto their Master Hildebrand, apart At Rome, a master arch of this black art. Quintius a Noble Roman that assails And dragd this Pope from th' Altar to the jayle, When th' Romans therefore did his house pull down Agrees with Hildebrand: and none must frown. Yet Hildebrand Contrary to his Word At liberty, now Quintius Galld, him Spurd (Whom once he'd put in barrell Stuck with nailes) Nine of his house up hangs. Popes take not bailes. A Widdow leads her Son too by a Cord About his neck unto this pope her lord, Of him for to receive him now again After he had a twelvemonths Smart up tain In banishment by him: to whom his tone Woman begon, begon, let me alone But after this he wills the judges to Condemn this youth, the which they would not do He orders one of them his legs to be Cut off which killd the Youth. Popes mercy See. But these are little Bans, will not Suffice The hungry Gudgeon, nor his glaring eyes. The Squemish Stomach of this wasthrill Pope Kecks not at Such Small Gnats. (A butterd rope) He falls on bigger Gobbits; Fatter bits His greediworm down his wide gullit slips. He'l Swallow down an Emperour so huffe And yet his Stomach counts it not enough. For Henry the forth the Emperour The Saxons basely vexing by their War The bishops too complain to Hellbrand's Pope In that he Benefices gave, in hope This Hellbrand would out burning Sparkles cast To burn his bristles. So his firy blast Comes out upon him charging him to out All Symonaries be the[y] ne're so Stout. And hence such as were for this Emperour Were, many frighted by this Sparkling knar, Lest they their dignities should lose, and Station They by their bribes gain petters Confirmation. And give their Oaths to be his Faithfull Sons. And sorely vex the Emperour, when drums Beat up the Saxon Wars, that hee excludes Some from their places, others he intrudes As they do call it. Then these babies fly To Hellbrand with complaint; who bitterly 1076Did Envy Henry, and he hence him cites Up to appeare at Rome. Or with his rites He'l brain him with his thunderbolt, at which The Emperour Surprizd, forth with doth pitch On persons and them sends to Hildebrand To gain his grace, and from Such deeds to stand. The Legats this Cursd fire brand of hell Doth take Scourge prison, Naked, Starve nigh well With Hunger Thirst, and Cold, then in disgrace Leads through the City, then them back a pace Did send away. And when the Sessions day Was come in which the Emperour should say What was the reason of his deeds, was come This Hellishbrand With Rhetorick on his tongue, The Synod entertains, asserting there Rome Head of th'World, the Lady ever clear Of this Round Orb Confers the Empire and The Popedom at her pleasure by her hand A right she gained by much blood, and pains. Judge therefore with mee with mee, Children plain Quoth he who shall here after reign at Rome. And fifteen thousand talants from his flume Runs over unto every man a part, A noble artifice of Fishing Art. But at this bold Incitement Henry A Synod Calls at Worms, to make reply And by his royall Majesty doth Cite The Pope there to appeare with all his light Supposing that the Pope exantorate By Caesars, and the Synods Sentence late, Could not by all his Liquids, and his Mates His Excommunicating Pellit Shoot. And Ruland Priest of Perma is out sent With the Imperiall Letter whose Content He while the Pope his Synod glaverd, did Approach into the Temple not forbid, To Shew the Same. And without terms of Fame Directs his Speech to Hellbrand which thus came The Emperour addicted truely to The true Religion. And the Bishops lo Sacred, of Italy, France, Germany, In Sacred Orders of bright Sanctity Command thee from that Function to depart, That thou gottst by respects, Cash, and bad art. Thou no true Pastor, Father, Pope art, nay But art a Thiefe, Wolfe, Robber, Tyrant gay. At which they quickly were all in a rout Ready his brains in th'temple to dash out. And in their rage they ecchoed out this tone. Kick Such a Wicked King out of the throne. Hence hee with Horrid Speech indeed knocks down The Emperour. And all of all renown That took his part, that famous bishops were He did deprive of Dignities: and cleare The Subjects from their Oaths of Fealty And Chargd the Bishops all in Germany Sworn to himselfe to make the Publication Of this Kings direfull Excommunication And calls on Princes, and on Subjects all From all obedience to this king to fall: Or else they with the same sort serv'd shall bee. And Choose another Emperour saith hee. Now on this fact rose many Bishop chuff And Princes of the Empire apt to puff Away the Emperour, conault to make An new one, and Such as would this course take Were chiefly Saxons, and the Sweve, who 'ttend A Synod at Tribury for this end Where Sighard yea and Altman teach this King They justly from the Church, and his Realm fling. The Emperour in great destress is told Ev'n by his Princes if this bond doth hold Beyond the yearly Day wherein't was made His Realm would quite be lost, what e're is said. And hence they Call the Pope to Germany. That there the Case he openly might try. Henry now doth out set for Rome indeed In middle of a Winter hard with Speed Through Frost, and Snow. The Pope for Germany Also set out, but hearing by his fly That Henry in Italy was come Hee turnd into the Strong Canusium. Not knowing what the Emperour intended And that Italian Princes him befriended. Now many of his Friends did from him fly, And barefoot to the Pope Peccavi cry. And many Roman Nobles to him cleave. (And good Sir Pope, we matter not your leave)[.] Henry calld Countiss Mathild and with her The Marquess Azzo, and an Abbat who With others to his holiness do goe To intercede for him who on base terms Him Entrance gain within the Wall, that hems The Castle in, without attendents all Without his Royall Robes (Kings humble fall) And barefoot fasting from the morn till night And thus did three dayes going, 'fore he might Approach before the Pope, who when he came To have access was novic'd by the Same. And brought to shamefull terms, as base as ere This Hellbrand pleasd to make, and all for feare Of losing of his Crown, the which Offend Th'Italian Peares who did him much befriend. That they desert him, if he'l not revoke His promise made to this abusive Pope But while he stay'd in Italy, this Brand Of Hell doth to the German Princes hand An order that they Rudolph Duke of th'Sweve Do Choose their King. And Henry to leave And by his Legats sent a Crown unto 1077Rudolph imbellisht with this Motto so The Rock gave Peter, Peter, Rudolph gives A Diadem. Hence Rudolph while he lives Against his Master arms untill his own 1080Right arm did lose its hand, when with sad tone At Mersburgh: thus he greets the bishops base See your Right hand which interposd in th'Case When I devoutly was obligd, that I Would not rebell 'gainst my Lord Henry. But th'Popes Command and Prelates strong request Induced me that I against my oath transgresst The end whereof you see. Let them take heed That stird me up, lest they by their bad deed Have not perchance induced mee into The Pip fall of Eternall Judgment so. Oh! bloody noses, and greate slaughter grew Upon this Wicked act this Firebrand threw. And when he Saw, Henry, Rudolph to Chase Hee like a brand cast from th'Infernall place, Smites him again by Excommunication A Second time: asserting this relation, That though he to the Church restored him, He had not to the Kingdom. Hence no King. But when the German Storm was well nigh ore Henry came knocking on this Helbrand's door. Mean while the German Princes, Prelates too [10]82On Hellbrands Side. Rudolph now dead, a new King make, Prince Harman Lucelburgian To please the pope's base humor if they can. At Isleby, and from much Garlick there Men calld him King of garlick in a jeere. [10]80But Henry in Italy doth bum This Saucy Pope whose towns to ashes run. And fixt his Army down before Proud Rome Then Hellbrand doth the Angell Tower assume His Strong defence: and like a Vilain there Provides his Slaughterman bussed in the eare, To hoise greate Stones upon the beams on high Over the Place in which King Henry Sat in Saint Maries Church who did repare Unto it dayly for the sake of prayer. And down upon his head to haule the Same Most craftily, as if Heaven did him brain. But while this Silver Spirited brisk Snap, Was for the Emperour Setting a trap A mighty Stone upon the Beams hee drew Which breaking of the planke thereon dropt threw. And down goes dun even with the Stone which Skill Stead of the Emperour, did th'Hangman kill. Now Hellbrand's String is brok, his Angell Tower Will not defend him. Henry hath power Above this mighty god. He slips away Unto Salern. And now without delay The Emperour at Rome a Synod brings That plucks the Wings of Helbrand, and unstrings His Bow, and out him from his Peters Chair 1081To Guibert of Ravenna gives that Care. And here you see how Patience great did waite While Such a monster acted monstrous hate [.] Guibert under the name, Clement the third, Chose by two Synods, though th'unlucky bird Calld Hellbrand branded him to his Vexation For Henry Cause with Excommunication Assends the Chair and Henry holds him in't And vext by Victor: Sene's his Seate in prent. But after Helbrand unto Hell was fled, Victor the third did soon put up his head, Whom Countiss Mathild Robert Norman, and Some others Pop'de, in hate to Clements wand Who by the men of Salern, Capua And other help made Clement not to Stay In Rome. And excommunicates this Pope And in his first yeare dropt off from his hope Some Say by poison mixt in Sacred wine 1089Some say much otherwise, yet pride doth shine[.] The Second Urbane follows him, who flies On Clement and the Emperour likewise Doth Excommunicate them both through hate And Clement him doth excommunicate. A vile Reviler, Vagabond, Turbanus Is Styld by Writers pens thus for Urbanus, Two heads at once: oh monstrous, nay just none For each beheaded each: So both are gone, Hence either both, or none: take which you will And if the body lives: its monstrous Still. If bad they bee then better off than on If good, then good head nods: and proove as none. 1100But be they monster like; each eaches brother As twins they quickly dy each after other. And now behold this Rabble Rout of Popes A String of Wickedness a Court that opes A Doore to Pride, Ambition, Treachery Oppression, Lies, Injustice, Perjury, Rebellion, Treason, Cruelty, and Blood Laciviousness, Adultery, and Mud Of Theft, of Robery, of Sorcery, Of Witches, Wizzards, Conjurours, a Sty. A Hive of Hornets, Nest of Serpents, Stings A gally Pot of Poison. Cage of Sins In Horrid Colour flourishing and fat That Patience greate doth blush, and Sweat hereat. I'le Stand no longer here but Strike the Oares Of Patience's bright Barge for other Shoares. Strang Worship Strange Worship blossoms much, like new Cloaths put Upon Gods Service of the Cony Cut Such as the other Centuries invented Are still in use: and yet as not contented New fashions more are Still attended on. And borrowd of the Whore of Babylon. That fills with grieving tears, the gracefull Eye Of Bleeding Patience such new modes to Spy. As here to fore so now, they on do go To overlay, or other wise ore throw Gods Worship Choice with Silver, Gems, and Gold Agnet the Emperess, Saint Benits Fold In which Monks of Cassina make their nest, With Gold, and Purple Garments did invest. The Gospell Booke with Silver Covers all Ore laid with Gold. Two Silver Cups not Small. Henry the Second Mersburgh Church consignd A Cup of Gold of eighteen Mark, refinde And Henry the Lame gave to the Same A Table all adornd with Gems of Fame Orelaid with wealthy Gold. And Henry who Was fourth so nam'd did on the Abby throw At Spires a golden Table bravely wrought The Fulda Abbat Rotingus when Caught By death, was making for the flock, its said, A Table Stuck with Gems. Also its laid In history, a Table all of Gold With Gems, and Various worke rare to behold Was at Constantinople made most bright, And else w[h]ere was a Silver Piller dight In part with gold, Six Cubets high displaid, And Set upon a Porphyry base there made. The bald gave to Saint Saviours Church Cassine, Two Silver Censars, one all guilt most fine. A Beame of molten brass with Candle sticks Ten fives he made, Wax tapers in them fix And Six greate Candlesticks three Cubits high Of Silver plate he formed Curiously. Henry the fourth gave to the Church of Breme An hundred Palls, three Silver Cups full clean A Silver Vessell for the Chrism: yea A guilded Silver Scuthin, Psalter gay With golden letters flourisht Censare and Rich Candlesticks of Silver highly Stand Moreover Image glory too they get Within their temples They at Cassine set Three Silver Crosses upon marble Steps. Christs picture hanging on the Cross him frets. The places neer to Rome paint Christ out cleare With Paul on's Right Peter his left hand there[.] Besides all this you'l see another kind Religious Adoration too designd Hellbrand did pray to Peter and to Paul When he with Curse the Emperour did mall Relicks they do adore. They of Cassine Saint Maarus Arm bone whole (as a rich Shrine) Shut in a Silver box most neatly made Like to a Tower compleat, receive arraid In Solemn Robes, with Candles in their hand With Frankincense, and prostrate to the land Adore, and kiss the Same religiously, The Cluniak Monks Saint Peters haire up cry. They at Cassine after this sort adore A Shread of th'towell which our Lord once bore And dri'de th'Apostles feet withall. The Clerk Two Candles lights unto it. (else all's darke) And then in order it is given to Each person to adore, and kiss. And so For this brave Worship we are told they keep In gold, and Silver Chests their Relicks, deep. Some also Studded are with Pretious Stone In Eyes of gold. Malfitan Such an one Brought to Cassin made of a bit of Wood Of Christ one Cross on which he nailed Stood. Baldwin Barbate the Earle of Flanders gave Th'Tronchin Monks John Baptists Tooth to have. Here gaudy Worship plated up with gold And Silver deck with Gems, yea manifold, Of bits of Bones, Blood, Clouts, Wood, Haire, a Tooth. How long shall Patience Sacrifice in truth Her pretious teares, to see things thus to rise? What difference, pray you, can you e're devise Between these men, and them of Ceilan; who Greate Veneration on a Tooth bestow? What though John Baptist's Tooth is yours? he's dead; And theirs an Apes tooth bee? out of their head Both knockt are, and are both of equall bone. Both are alike Divine: if either one, It's worse than apish to adore a tooth Whether John Baptists or an Apes in truth[.] Apostasy. Apostasie comes spreading ore the face Of Gospell Worship Patience weeps a pace Too see the same untill her heart grows sore That Gospell purity goeth out of Doore. Beside the greate and gross Apostasy Blending the Gospell truth with Paganry In this greate monstrous Roman Church we finde An other great Apostasy that windes Quite from the Gospell name, and up doth height The Pagan Idoll Worship as the right. And now I come to lavish ore with teares That down do trickle Patience Cheeks and Sphears Th'Hungarian Christian King Geisa by name His Kingdom leaves by death. Stephen to it came With's Wise nam'd Gisla Christians both which thing Griev'd Guile th'Transylvanian petty King. His Unckle, on him flies, the Christian Cause Out of Hungary bleeds, by the Sword he draws. And now greate store to pagan Worship fall Till Stephen did his Unckle route and gall. Bernard the Duke of Saxony compells The Winuli by Fines, and Silver Spells From Christs good Cause, and Gospell to requile To paganism, and themselve they Spoile. Mistive the Prince of Vandalls-Wagiri, Against the Christians rose in Cruelty. Reducd them all to paganism, who Beyond the Albrid dwell. And grace ore throw. And when at length the Christian Faith he chose His folk Unking him. Hee in Exile goes. After him, Udo his Curst Son out Strides In Saxony: and down Christ name now slides He being Slain came Godescalk his Son And all Northalbing Country ore did run In such a fury on the Christian there That paganism all advanced were. The Hungars after Stephens head was laid, Peter his Sisters Son their king assaid, Them to defile with Pagan worship, and Yet down it fell again, and Henry's hand Erects there Christianity again. Which they indeed but feebly entertain. But Peters burden making of them groan, Bishops with Politicians make their moane To fetch home Andrew, and Levant, who were Banisht before the Kingdom. Hence Votes here Fell equall, and they were therefore constraind To let the Rout, that to New-Castle train'd Now live in pagan Customs and adore The Scythian deities, as heretofore. When Godescalk fell by the Sclaves who had Him for their Prince, the third time they all mad, Breake out in rage like to a fiery flame, And do their utmost 'gainst the Christian name. Their Pagan wayes again advance and tend Idolatry. Its hard to make men mend. When Andrew left his Crown unto his Son Nam'd Bela, the Hungarian Prefects run Intreating him new Superstitions to Destroy, and their old pagan wayes make grow. Besides these things, the greate Apostasy Of Antichristian Christianity In Superst[it]ious fopperies, and lies That now are running, fill with watry eyes The tender heart of Patience, one or two More instances for this you here may view. As if there was not Monkery enough This Century new Sorts of Monks out puffs Monks of Umbrosa Vallis now out Spring 1040Being first hatcht under John Gualbert's wing. The Grandemontine Monks do now arise Whom Stephen of Averny by the Cries Made to him in the aire, the Voices font, 1076In Grandimont, in Grandimont, in Grandimont. This Oracle did send him to that place Wherein he built a Roost for this Sweet race[.] And the Carthusians too now are new hatcht By Bruno Colens Presull, and are matcht With others on the accident that fell Out at the funerall of one lov'd Well At Paris for his learned piety Who on the Beire ats Grave mouth, rose did cry, I am accusd by Gods just judgment clear. All seing this, amaizd, did leave off here 1080His burying untill the following day, Which coming he the same Speech made. Hence they Defer do his interment till the next Whence all the City nigh, resort perplext To see him buri'de. And now on the Biere He in their Sight Sat up and cries out there Most horridly, I by Gods judgment just Am Damn'd. Hence Bruno all amaizd, wee must, Said he, the World thrust if we would bee For ever Sav'd, Seing this man whom wee Did all esteem most Holy, hath Such end And so built in Cathusia whence attend The Monkish order calld. Cathusian Friers Which on this Sad account abroad aspires The Salisgunstad Counsill did out vent A Prohipitian, that forbids in Lent And in the other yearly Fast to wed, A worthy act made by a Worthy head. Gregry the Seventh called Hildebrand All Married priests condemns, and also damnd By Excommunications Such as do Take Baptism, or Mass from Such. Why So? And yet they do that baptism make Stand Done by a Laick, or a Pagans hand. He doth dissolve oaths binding from all bonds. To Such as by his oatting Staff he wands[.] He damns all Such as preach that on the Day Of Sabbath Work unlawfull is, yet lay An Holy day did for Liberius An Heretick, as saith Eusebius: Anselm doth say for Such as Vowed (Oh knave) A Single Life, to marry, or to have A Will to wed its damnable, oh see Yet for one honest Wise, some say there bee Among these men six hundred bawds. Oh fy What wickedness is here? Hypocrisy. Pope Urban calld a Counsill to advise At Claramot, and all his Rhetorick tries To moove an Holy War as it is Styld Against the Saracen and Turks that Spoild Jerusalem, and many Christians there And many Pilgrims too, that came to Clear Away their Sins even in the Holy land And at Christ Cross on Calvary there Stand. And greate reward doth promise such as would Attend this matter, that in this World should Be their incouragment; and in the World To come. which did inflame the Synod furld Up in their purposes such Courage, they Excite all Nobles and all Kings this way, That there more than three hundred thousand Strong Out to these wars do go. Godfry the Son Of th'Earle of Bulleign was intrusted to Comand the Same nigh all. With them did go The Bishop Ademar of Podia On whom the Pope a pardoning Power did lay That so their Sins might be by his greate grace To them demolished, and have no place. And those that went unto this Holy War Aventine saith they did a Goose prefer And carry on, which they did preach to bee The Holy Ghost. Oh. horrid blasphemie. When Hildebrand did marri'd priests depose The Laicks that baptizd, as Storie goes, In Stead of holy Oyle did Earewax use To oint, the babe with. Both they should refuse. Some Priests the Coporall Cloath cast in the flame When Scarfires out did breake making the Same An Holy Spell to quench like water there The fire that burnd. Strange Superstition here. A Priest at Wedding [and] at Mass can't drink The Wine i'th'Cup, all turned blood, did bring't To Magdeburgh in whose Chiefe Church he makes It a Recluse. (Oh Hidden Manna slakes)[.] Leo the Ninth could not the Cup wherein His Clark had poison put, take up (Strange thing) From th'Altar, and enquiring of Christ, Why The people praying prostrate, Suddenly The Divell doth the Poisoner Surprize. Hence he the reason of the matter Spies. And for the Altar bids to keep the Cup With Christs blood, as a Relick safe up shut. Innumerable thinge with such black face Are to be found which Grace divine disgrace And greatly exercise Gods Patience so In that they do his glory rich undo[.] Rebellion. The Eggs of Pride laid in Apostates nest Hatcht by the Serpent bubs the Shells possest Of arch Rebellion out do Chearping come And fly abroad beating the Divells Drum Which is his Musick. But to see the Same Patience is greatly Pain'd. Obedience, lame. Popes up against Popes rise. The Cardinalls And people too aginst their popes out crawll. Prelates against their Prince: the Pope doth rise Against the Emperour: Subjects devise For to depose their kings. Good Order done. Nigh all things ravell, and in Snicksnarns run. Two Popes at once the one against the other And each do strive his opposite to smother[.] Benit the Eight his Cardinalls disgust And in his Seat another pope do thrust And as he treads the Seat, the golden Spurs Do gagg him in the Head. And down he whors. Benit the ninth doth finde himselfe too weake And gets a partner by his Side to wheake. They bristle do against these two and make The third Sylvester th'henroost pearch to take And now three dunghill Cocks do clap their Wings And Crow at once, untill their Combs were Sindgd. Henry the third did Bamberge Bishop ripe Set in their Seate. And so, their noses wipe. Four Popes at Once Benit Sylvester fare And Gregory and Clement who off pares The others Combs. What is the Headship quarterd In which head is't? Or is't by these quite Slaughterd. Benit the tenth is Sindgd by Hildebrand Off of his Seat: and Nicolas in't doth Stand. The Lombard Prelate rise 'gainst Alexander Make Cadolus their Pope, a brisk Commander. He out 'gainst Alexander in the field And fight doth for the Seat, and will not yield Though worsted, but the other calld out right A false Apostle and Adultrous Weight, But Alexander though he did Spur down Poor Cadolus, Helbrand tooke by the Crown. And from the Altar drew him. And did fist Him soundly, and in prison him off twist. Helbrand up starts Gregry the Seventh calld And Henry fourth that Emperour he malld Him Excommunicates, and all on's Side Dissolves his Subjects from their Oath that tide Them to him, and his Empire gave away. And unchurcht all that Would not this obey. Clement the third Succeeds, at him there flies Victor that Roost Cock firce, and strikes, and dies Then Urban, (righter called Turban) up rose And flies withall his furry to depose This Clement, cause the Emperour entreats And so the Conclave Chose him to the Seate, And thus we see hard Heads do knock, like blocks, Untill the brains do ring. And th Headship drops. Prelats do snout their Princes too beside, Lanfrank against Will Rufus raisd his pride Untill the Conquouring Will did Clip his Wings. Whose frowns did wound him in his Vitall Strings. Anselm Succeed in Place and Pride did nose The Huffing King on Romes behalfe, and goes In banishment, till Henry rose up king Then home he's brought, but yet he claps his Wing For Romes rich intrest, and they're Clipt again And he to shun the Storm, 'gain stems the main. Subjects against their Sovereigns rebell Rudolph the Duke of Swevia would quell His Sovereign Henry the fourth whose throne Imperiall the Pope had made his own. And when the Popish bishops had him trimd Had Scrapt his spurs, and Cut his Comb and wingd Him for the game, hee in the Cock pit Crows And on his Master flies, untill he lose His own brisk Spirits by his masters Heels That Cramp him in the neck and down hee reels. Conrade, the Son of Henry Quart, the same Set by his Father, Italy to reign When he had it reduc'd and went away For Germany, was by the Crafty play Of Machid guggld in to use his arms For Holy Church against his Fathers Swarms The Which he doth, and doth the Royall Crown Invest his Head with. Urban's good renown For Setting of it on lies here. Who did To Ruggers Daughter King of Normans bid Him Welcome, and did Wed him to the Same. An utter foe unto his Father. Shame. Oh horrid treachery. But though they crow Hereat that enmity to's father Show, Seing the Cockrill to peck in th'eyes Of th'old Rooster. But before he tries His heels his Spirits faile him down he falls And quickly dies. And this them goars like mauls What dirty things are here? nay thousands more Of Such a geer my pen might amble ore, But here's sufficient to evince and cleare The tugging Worke that turneth Patience Sphere. Cruelties. But Cruelties that thick, and three fold fly In Bloody Colours, and in flames that try What mettall Heaven's made of, in deep groane Make Patience Sweate and very full of tones We now shall shew here in our Looking Glass The face of Some of these as on we pass. This Horrid Cruelty the Praci? usd Upon one Brunus Bishop, they misusd. They Chop his feet off and his hands oh! Dread! And after this they Sever off his head. The Son of Bernard Duke of Saxon, goes With arms in Freesland, there he mischiefe does And all the Ministers belonging to The Church of Brems their eyes by him out goe. Herman the Bish: of Hamborough in arms Goes out in fury, and mischievous harms Did Cruely affect his own flock with. Whose blood did Stain him in his inmost pith. When Rixa Queen of Poland did withdraw With her Son Cassimir all things like Straw, Grew to a flame. Now wicked robbery And fire and Sword did rage most barbarously. And to Complet the Woe, the Russians Spoile The Northern Costs. And the Bohemies Soyle The West and South with Cruell Blood and Fire And many by this Cruelty expire. Swene King of Danes wining the English Crown In Cruelty designd to pluck all down: And utterly destroy all English blood And Christ's blesst Intrest there: but God withstood. Gerard, and Beztert Baldus and Ben'tha Hungarian Bishops went home to Convay Their Kings from Excile at the Danow were Stond by the Pagan nobles that were there. Ben'tha excepted. Gerard set on high Upon a rock, hence headlong Cast, but by The beating of his heart live did appeare, Wherefore they run him thorough with a Speare. An[d] many other yea a multitude Thus Cruelly were usd by pagans rude. When Henry the forth to Triers gave Conrad the Colen Bishop, Bishop grave The Triers vext prompt Earle Theodorick And he Surprizd the Bishop in the nick As going to his Church and left him to Be butcherd by the Souldiers who him throw Thrice headlong from a rock and his chiefe harm Thereby was Chiefly th'breaking of his arm They mad thereat do run him through, he's slain, And them of Colen do requite the Same. Their Bishop who the oath of Loyalty Unto the Emperour refusd they fly Upon, and out him from, of his honour thrust. And as he was at Supper on him rusht And Stones, and Weapon, at him cast, and slew Some of his Waiters: way then others flew[.] The Bishop to Saint Peters Church flies: while They Search his Palace. And his Wealth do Spoile And his Wine Cellars into Wine Fats turn His Hogs heads there Sheading their Spirits mourn, His Sacred Vessells, Sacred Vestures and Rich things they make their plunder by Strong hand And he himselfe was feathers forc'd to Change And in a Common Coate away to range By darksom night to save his Life, or they Had Certainly his glory made away. When that the Sclaves did Godeschalke exile The Stoute Priest Eppo with him went, whom while He was at Lentzin, cruelly they go And offer him up on their Altar do. And many lay and Clergy persons more They Cruelly did kill. And out did roare Some Ston'd to death. And John first Bishop at Faire Mechelburgh their Wicked hand on clap And beate with Clubs and for a gazing Stock Him carry through Some towns, they S[c]orn they mock. Then Sever off his head, his hands, and Feet And cast his Stumpy Carkass in the Street And on a Speare his head they offer to Their Radigast or God, at Reth. Oh! woe. And Godeschalks religious Wife they take And other pious Women Stript Starke nake And Scourg with thongs and naked her dismiss What pagan Cruelty and baseness 's this? Now Hildebrand that hellish firebrands threw Abroad in all the Christian world that grew Mischievously most Cruell ery where It would be endless up to Summ here His Cruelty Pope Alexanders eares Are Witness. Oh gentle Fists. The Peares Of Germany that Henry did depose Evn at his bidding, and all German Woes And blood and fire that followd. Quintus too Whom in a Cask Spict with long lains hee threw Do witness beare unto his Clemency Which those that felt, did take it grievously[.] He in his Priestly Robes in Pulpet round, Bishops, and Cardinalls then there did Sound This Cruell Omen, in Saint Peters Church Against the Emperour, that did him learch[.] King He'ry, by Saints Peters day next shall Undoubtedly be dead; or 'else shall fall Out of his Throne, which if this prophesy Proove false he would no longer verily Be held to be the Pope. And now he tries By Cut throat Roagues to kill the King; but Spies At length his Witchery, nor Wicked Will Could Save his Credit[.] Henry is Still When Peters day is passt in's throne, then Hee Will have his Speech of Spiritall death to bee. Sigfride the Mentz Archbishop, Gunther who 1064Was Bamburghs Bishop, Regenspurge's Otto With William, Triers Bishop: other Peares Of France with others of all ranks their eares Pricke up indeed of Superstitious Sise. Full Seven thousand persons Wise, unwise Must needs go pray in Canaan's holy land And a vast deale of Wealth do with them hand. Which made Arabian mouths to water for't And on them now they leape: and don't abhor't. And many Slay at Romulum, they fly Into Carvasalim, and fortify Against the Arabs who persue the flight And by the Walls do on a Soulder light Ript up and in the form there of the Cross Him stretch. And in their Sight that had this loss Inquire do at his Intrails and divine And threaten thus to treate that any time They take, unless they on them freely would Bestow all Wealth, their Silver, and their gold. And of this host, two thousand scarce was found The following yeare that homeward could rebound. William the Conquorour in England flew And Englands Bishops almost all out threw. 1066Eleven hundred Priests, a thousand others At York by Cruelty he kills, and smothers. In Anglesey those Cursed Earles two Hughs One Chesters Earle, the others Shropshires, twoes Whose manigment Will left his Wars unto Did Such accursed Cruelty out throw As dugg out Some mens Eyes, Some noses slit, Some tongues Cut out, Some Arms and hands up rip. Somes testicles, Cut off, and ery Where Women abused, and deflowred were. Brave Stanislaus Cracow bishop bold Did faithfully reproove the King, we're told, Nam'd Boleslaus, with friendly speech at first, And after Sharply, seing Still he burst In Cruelty, Lust, Luxury, Oppression, In Sloath, and Ideleness, whom by descretion Seing no mendment, Excommunicate Hee doth. And now the King through Cruell hate Forbad him Sacred rites to Celebrate Within the City. He then out did go Some ? more ? him ? St. Mich'el Chapell, Celebrates them there. The King enraged when he of it doth heare, Goes with his guard into the temple, and Smote of the bishops head as he did Stand By th'altar, by the Sword, whose brains thereby Were Spartled on the Walls. The Guard do fly 1079Upon his body dragg it out at doore And hack it all to bits. Yet Patience bore. And threw the Same to doggs to et them then. A piece of Dreadfull Cruelty in men. Simon Jerusalem's Chiefe Patriarch Doth in his lines to Urban (Turban Arch) Even thus Complain of horrid Cruelty They from Mahometans Sustaind. His Cry Runs thus, We th'Holy City Citizens Men of Christ native Soile by Saracens Suffer such things as Christ our King sustaind By his own Country men that here then reign'd. We're beaten, Scourg'd, thrust through by Sword and dy. And evry day some of's are Slaughter'd down By Clubs, Axe, and the Cross, from town to town We wander do. And live a very poore Exild, and Vagrant Life. Hard things endure. Thus Hee. Oh! Cruelty. What ne're enough! What strang thing then is man that out doth puff Such Cruell tortures each on other so Onely to please their spite in eaches woe? Oh! how doth this grieve Patience? And procure The Glorious Hand of Justice on this sore, Whereto she (grieved Patience giving leave) Applies her selfe. Crownd with a glorious wreath. The Shine of Divine Justice/Efficiency Under Henry 2 I'le from this muddy Aire that grieves the Heart Of Holy Patience Step that Grace makes Start; And to the Holy Court of Justice Steere To see her Wash her hands, that did appeare As if Shee had in this dark pitchy night No hands, or hands polluted, and not white. Or that her Eyes were dropt out of their holes, Or wanted Spectacles: but in her Shoales I now strike Saile and in her open Court My Pen arriving, it will give report, How on her glorious Bench in Robes all Bright More White than Snow, She Sits dispensing right, In all her Sentences She Executes. And Wonder-Working Efficacy suites Here very Well to testify the same: Which through this Century maketh such a Flame. God payes this Wicked age with Woefull things: With Plague and Pestilence: Harde Winters keen: With Rainy Summers, Inundations: Springs Of Prodigies, and Monstrous things are seen With Blood, and Fire. Wars raging dreadfully Through out the Christian World most furiously. 1004A Dreadfull fire turns Papia to dust. 1005The next yeare Shews an horrid Comet bright: 1006The following year a grievous Famine Crusht. And Pestilence went raging on with might. That it was thought a greater number di'de Thereby, than all from whom it turnd aside. A little while before it came, there were A Spring of very healthfull Waters pure In Lotharinge turn'd blood. Th'Sun red did pear About the Same time. Drops of blood endure Upon mens Cloaths rain'd from the lofty Sky Which Cast upon this Wicked age its eye. 1009Three years allowd oft, and unusuall rains. God hangs a Comet out his fiery flag And at its heels a Plague the Saxons bains. That Equalld noblemen with tag and rag. 1010In Aufred Village five and twenty dayes Boild blood, that did the neighb'ring Ford't assayes. With these things parallell, these mischiefs run. The Bulgars under Samuell Thrace annoy. Basill the Emperour did sorely bum: Them, Fire and Sword their Country did destroy Dug out the Eyes of fifteen thousand, 'ploy 'd Yet left each hundred one them home to guide. At which dread Sight Samuel amazd down fell Unto the ground beside his Senses mad. And quickly after this sore pains expell His Vitall Sparke. He dies of th'Heart ake Sad. Justice here payes the debt home thoroughly Which was their due that Thrace and Greece did Stroy. 1003And Germany is all afire, the Duke Of Austria against the Emprour rose 1004But is tooke down. His brother Bruno's Shook. Italian Bishops with their princes chose One Andovine their Emperour, that Cost 1005His Life, All towns so in this Pade they lost. Bernard the Duke with's Saxon now rebells. The Slaves destroy beyond the Alb nigh all. Adelbero of Triers rings the bells Of War and Herry Duke of Bojor Calls With Metz Archbishop. And Agusta take 1009Whose force the Emperour by force then brake[.] The Poles do clash. Bohemy do destress. In parle of peace put out Boloslau's eyes. 1007And Prage besiege which Henry did redress. Theodrick Earle of Flanders is a prize Unto the Frizers. Normans Frizia Wast. 1010And burn Trajectum. Justice now is plac'd. 1012The Turke did take Jerusalem, alas! The moon now looks like blood: Earth sorely s[h]akes A Burning Faggot like a Tower doth pass With an hugh Crash to Earth: in heaven it makes. The Swelling Seas doth men and Cities drownd. By Plague, and Famin multitudes fall down[.] In Lotharinge, a water Spring Springs blood. Now twins are born with mouths like Goose bills. And right arms like goose Wings. The third day good Smile each on other. But the Mayor them kills For their dread Shape. Rhene Swells and Danow high Do Bridges, Houses, Trees and Corn fields Stroy. Light'ning in Saxony a Temple burns. A Sow did pig a pig having its head Like to a mans. A Sitting hen out turns A four legd Chicken. England great Stirs bred, Ileland. And No[r]mandy: God payes their Vice. A Sacralegious man's destroi'd by mice. At noon day th'Earth did take a mighty dance. A western tempest turns down Fulda's Halls. The Flemish Seas by mighty Storms up prance Much Harm thereby on neighbring borders falls The Saracens wast Italy, all Soiles A nigh it. War in Lotharinge up boiles. 1017A four months blazing Star shines, great beam like. 1018A Sow a pig out drops with humane Face. 1019And men are follow'd by the Plague with might. As three passt the famine did them chase 1020A winter Cold; that many persons slew That were not able t'beare: the Cold so grew[.] A Circle like a rainbow, with four lines Divided thwart it, Circles round the Sun. The Elb, and Visarg Swell and damage fines Their borderers. A Plague hence out doth run. Those it destroyd were full of Serpents found, That tedious made them t'lay under ground. In May the Earth doth take another trip. The next yeare while the Synod sitting were At Aquilgrane, the Sky so hot did Strip Both Men and beast of life that they died there. The Marble Pillars and their Arches Sweat. One would have thought they'd been by water wet. In this Kings reign a woman at one birth Five babes brough[t] forth in Alsace the more low. The Auspurgh Prince calld Babo had on earth Thirty two Sons and daughters eight also Born of two Wive[s], all which he left behinde. This blessing great here 'mong greate judgments finde. Under the Emperours West Conrade. 2. begining 10 ?? East Constantine reigns 3, Romanus Arggropulus 5, Michael Paphlago. 5 The East and Western Realms are di'de in blood. The Agarens, the Turks and Caracens And Arabs wast do Syria like a flood. And Haran too Myra in Lycia's fens. The Ilands of the midland Sea infest. The Scythian Pazinaks Bulgars molest. England, and Germany and others more Do bloody noses carry: and for Lights Whole towns do flame. Strange Candles great its sure The Which Strange Prodigies presage, and Sights. 1031A Comet flames Greate Inundations Spoile And Famine now, and Plague do mortalls moile. Locusts and Famine Sore Armenia Stroy And all those parts. Greate troops of People seek 1038New quarters and Not long from thence the Cry Of Christmass Thunder Startles them. Oh Schreek. At noon a Beam of fire of wondrous Sise In th'East appears, in th'West falls from the Skies. 1039When Conrade quelld them there in Italy, Such dreadfull thunder rattl'd in their ears Many are Struck out of their Wits thereby And many Strucken dead, and die for fears. And quickly after Conrade Slips aside Into his grave. And leaves the World so wide[.] Udo the Vandall under Mistave who Such mischiefe Wrought comes to his recompence He's Stobd, and drops to dirt. His Son also Cald Godeschalk that did in his defence Great Spoile to be reveng'd though after mild His people put to death, after exild. Under the Emperours East as Michael Calaphat. And Theodora Constantin Monomach. 12./Theodora 2? and Michaeljura West as Henry3? begining 1039 The Turks brought by the Hagarens do take Now Babylon: and th'Arabs do assault. And now Constantinople come a baite These Emperours are found in Such greate fault They are so Perboild in their Lusts that they Have ruin renderd them to be their pay. Europe all ore is full of Fire and Swords Justice will pay her debt without constraint. I shall not hence her wars depaint, my Words Shall unto Smaller instance[s] give paint. Duke Edrick who betrayd Egelred King. And Edmond Ironside Slew I hence will bring. He telling this unto Canutus then The onely King of England, had reply I'le make thee Higher than all my Lord, and men. And strikes his head off, Sticks it up on high On Lo[n]don Bridge: His body out did pitch Into the Thames: Some say, 'twas the town Ditch. That wicked Swane that did so England plague, Some years before a dreadfull plague did finde. Who suddenly amongst his knights was made To yell and Cry, fall down, and dy, resign'd His Soul up. Some Say Stabd by Edmund's Knife, By hand unseen. Which tooke away his life[.] That Kentish Earle, Earle Godwin come to the Stage. Who promp[t]ed Hardecnute and licence gains Against the Normans that in honour Sage Attend the Princes young, as nobles trains Alfred, and Edward who their Mother, th'queen Did come to Visit, not a great while Seen. He with his men at Gilford meets them: and Slays nine there out of ten, a tith sets by: Then tithes this tithe, each tenth of't by doth hand Winding their guts out of them till they dy. He blinded Alfred, him to Ely sent Whence quickly he unto his long home went. Some say they took a gut end through an hole They in his body out and by goads prick Him on untill his Intraill round a pole They stuck, all were rapt. Oh! hellish trick. But marke the end, the scales do turn, he shall Now take his turn. Justice doth on him fall. He with King Edward sits at meat did fling This out. One brother helps another when His Son that waited, tript. Whereat the King Upon this Saying thus replied ag'en. And I had had a brother to my help Had it not been for you. This lasht the Whelp. Whereto the Earle replies, oh! King, Let mee Be Choakt forthwith, ev'n with this bit of bread If anything against thy brother bee, By me devisd, or thee. The bit in's head, His Jaws are forth with Closd: he's Choakt out right Having his Wish, against his will. Strange Fright. But I must back again. Harde Kanute Whose power this Godwin acted in those prancks 1042In Lambethiolly soon is Struck quite mute And eight dayes thence falls dead, now Justice Cramps. And Swane his Sisters Son falls from's horse shy Scard by an hare, killd on a Stump thereby[.] 1042This yeare gave birth a Seven years famine too, An Horrid tempest with great rain doth Storm. The flemish seas their dams breake dow[n], oreflow 1043All with it far and nigh are men down born. Storms, Summer rains offend and autumn Snows Now little Fruits and Wine. Death also grows. And now about the Divell tooke away An English woman Witch who in the aire Made such a fearfull howling, that they say Was heard some hours nigh four miles off. Strange fare. Good forecast! went shee not things to prepare Against the Witchs came from Peters Chaire? 1045The Divell like a B[l]ackemore did call To Bruno then of Wirtsburgh as he sayl The Danow. Ho, ho, Sir said hee withall I'm an ill genius, thou art mine, all haile Where s'ere thou go'st, thou shall in truth be mine I'le harm thee not as yet, or at this time[.] But thou again shall see mee e're't be long. And when they'd passt about some ten mile thence, To Bosenburgh, and in their Lodgen come And Salutations hard by had dispensd, But down the Chamber falls wherein they were. And Bruno's ruin did therein appeare. 1046The three Pope Witches Squeezing Peters Chair To pieces, it as excraments out groans. And Benits Spirit to him did repare And Choakt him in the Woods perhaps alone. Sylvester back is sent, and Gregory Is judgd unfit Church buriall dignity. Pope Damasus by poison's turnd away Constance doth feel an Earthquake Cradle rock. And Certain lakes in Italy they say That Julius Cesar with Square stones Stopt, drops Could not get through, ore flow, makes Narny flow Down bridge, and Buildings much, and men orethrow. Pope Clement's Choakt by Poison, now again A Sow a pig pigs with a humane head. A Hen a Chicken hatcht with four legs plain. A famine rageth much and with much dread. A noble man luxurious is assaild By mice and bats and slain: though stript, it faild. They now at Rome dug up a gyant tall Higher than the City Walls, and in his breast A wound four foot six inches long, withall At's head a burning lamp compleatly dresst. Into the Channell droppings of the Street He being cast, did moulder under feet. Filius Evandri Pallas, quem lancea Turni Militis occidit, more suo jacet hÃ®c.

The Western Realm all ore with War annoy'd: Fire, Sword, and Slaughter Lords become of late. France, Spain, and Italy do Smoake and Fry And England Weeps, and Germany doth Cry[.] 1057Stones mixt with Haile are rained from the Skie And Certain men are killd by Lightning soon. The Emp'rours Shield and Sword in Whitsunday In Geslar Palace Lightening did Consume. 1058A Comet hangs over Polonia cleare, King Casimire drops in his grave this yeare. 1059In Torney Coasts a troop of Snakes pitch field A Fight prodigiously they now engage Where many fall on both sides: Such as yield Creep wounded to an hollow tree where rage And hissing round it did the Victors then Till rounded in by fire they're burnt by men.

Famine there rag'd they see. And in this tract three brave plump Popes did Sup A passing health of Brazutes Well Spic'd Cup. About the first Cock Crow the Sky most cleare A rainbow like a girdle girds the Sky. And with the rising Sun there rising 'peare Two Pillars of a Shining golden die One hand the left, th'other the right hand place. And some degrees ascended did their face. 1076Before that Bishop Albert di'd at Breme Who was a black Art artist tears appeare On Cross (Here's Weeping Cross) a train Of Hogs and Dogs drew to the Altar neer. And in the Suburbs Wolves in blocks did howle. With horrid jarring fighting there with owls. But to Step back a little all's not ore That due to Godwin was for his base deeds. His Sons do quarrell: Tostius pays still more Who slew his brother Harolds men: proceeds At Herford, Cut up, pickled them in Casks With Salt, Wine, Vinegar. His Spite unmasks. When Harold's king, this Tostius in the north Arms with the Danes, and Norweyes him to out. Harold doth with his Soulders, he led forth Give battle to them. Tostiu's slain with rout. But Will the Norman then assaults and beats Him, He lost's Life and Crown. Sin brings Such feats. A Vement frost, and huge Strong ice began With this November and did last untill The middst of Aprill, did the Vinyards damn[.] At Collen Sings a Woman thus, There Will In Flanders reign till Antichrist's Sad times The race of Frisius, fled how none divines. When Harald King of Dane joynd battle faire With Harquin's army ore their head was seen 1066By both the Hosts a weapon in the aire Go wandering, that Harquin Slew, it seems. At Wedding all the Sacred Wine in th'Cup Was turnd to blood: and Stowd at Magd'burgh up. Some bishops Crossiers Staffs, and th'little Cross At Stederburgh do trickle down with Sweate. And Crows and Ravens do a whole day toss In furious fight. The Slain on both Sides greate. 1077A boy at Byzant's born with goatlike feet Having in's front one Eye, a Cyclops Sweet. 1077When Helbrand the Emperour ore laid Without his Cardinall or Synod-Call ? his Pulpet made Strong with new timber rent in pieces all As if that Peters pulpet did disdaine Him and his haughty facts, that blob and Stain. 1080At Mentz where Rudolph Crowned was there were A fearfull Earthquake in the yeare that he Was Overcome.

But chiefly they of Italy were finde Their houses fall down by it under min'de. Hens, Gess, and Peacocks other tame fowles too Grow Wild, and ran into the Woods and croak. Fish in the Waters die when Mathild threw The Peters Patrimony on the Pope. This Voice's then heard above. A Woman drinke To Christians poison doth with Hony tinct. When Will the Conquerour in Normandy Lay Sick Phillip the French King cast a jeare On his fat belly Saying Will did ly In long At Rotomag in Childbed here At Which he said When I am Churcht and right I will in France a thousand Lights up light. And when recoverd he, in July when All fruits were flourishing on France did fall With fire and Sword.

And now about that Wretched brande of Hell, Whom Peters Chair some time before much Sick Of Such ill Humours, had spewd out, down fell By Conscience galld, and down to hell did pick. 1088A firy Dragon in the Sky men view That Vomits flames out of his mouth that flew. 1091An Earthquake rattles England: Crop but thin And late ere rip. They hardly Seed can Sow Or ere December: famin up did Spring[.] A Well nigh Abindon with blood doth flow For three Whole dayes. The heavens also Seem To burn with fire. And Prodigies are Seen. Windes down do Clatter many building[s] high In London. Winchcomb Abby Tower too falls. Constantinoples buildings down much ly. Rains make the Vallies all, as Seas. Fish Stalls. The beauteous Statue great of their great round Tall Pillar falls, kills many persons sound. Locust by troops from East to West do fly.

An Harper tells King Erick he co[u]ld play Men into madness. Erick will him try. Orders his guard out of the tunes to Stay And when the noise of madmen Rose, to high. The harper playes a note Sever[e] which set Into a Sad and dumpish State or fret. He then a Cheerfull pleasant note up struck Their frame is changed: they filled are with joy. He turns to austere tunes which in they Suck And fall to rage and rave, and madly Cry. The Guarde breake in to hold them and the King Who were alike Starke mad. And so did fling. The King by force out of their hands did get. Bounc'd on the doore and down it breake he goes Out thence, Snatcht up a Sword and in this fret Slew four men. And his guard with pillows do At leng[th] with danger much ore lay him, and Prevaile to hold him by the Strength of hand. William the Conquerour that wast did lay All towns and Churches thirty miles in Space All in South Hampton shier that make he may The Parke New Forest, where his Deere do trace And Such a person as their Breed annoyes He punished by putting out his eyes. 1101But justice hath it's day, King Rufus there In his rich gaim is shot down by a dart Wot Tirrell Shot out at a gallant Deere. Here is his end. His grandson Richards heart Is broken in this place. Duke Roberts Son. From parents Sins of Childrens ruins run. Now to conclude you here may clearly Spy Divine efficiency Sprindging her rayes Through this darke Age therein to testify The Glory of Gods Justice and her praise. Which shining out most bright hereby I leave Her Court. And Holy Truth my pen bequeath. The Glory of Divine Truth. As I my pleasure Boate struck in thy Bay, Most Holy Truth, I in a fog was lapt. My latitude was lost, no Star, nor Day Yeilds me an Observation as it hapt. Wherefor I dropt a Sounding Stick and found I could the depth of this Stiffe Current Sound. And anchorage I saw was good firm ground, But Shelves to try the Pilates Skill abound. Wherefore I left my Quadrant, and imply My Compass. And my optick Glass I tooke And through this Fog a Shining Sky I Spy Of Splendent truth that all should on it look. Wherefore I set a Shoar and in the Soile Of Holy Truth, the beams of Some rich mine I there have delved in, I here out quoile Before your Eyes that you may see their Shine. Those Truths that were like Clouded Stars last age, That through truth's Optick then did shine Shine still. To mention them I shall not now engage Save as their beams in other Vessells Still. The which I now attend without delay. Preceptive truth these darksom dayes do shame. Prophetick Truth most brightly doth display Its beams in this Dark night and Such I'le name. Propetick Truth Truth saith, the Smoake out of Abyss should fly And blinde the Sun. And this we finde, The Sun of Righteousnessess Eye This ages Smoake doth blinde. Truth saith, they in the last dayes should give heed, To Divells Doctrine, and to lies. This age attends upon Such deeds And doth Such things devise. Theophylact by his rich black Art curst Lifts Benit Eighth, to Peters Chaire. And also John the twenty first. Black Arts most matters Steere. Benit the ninth, and Gregory the Sixth And Seventh too, Curst Hildebrand Were Arch Magitions; Chanting tricks Were proper to their hand. Hibert of Beems, William of Rochell I'le And Wolfstan too of Worcester These Bishops did their prancks defile In black arts and such Coures Sir. Women did Masses use for Charms, which thing, Sal 'gunstade Synod did condemn. Some Clarkes, for divinations bring And Idols offer men. The Emp'ress Chanegund greate Marbles brought To build the Temple gay at Breams. By th'Old Boy's hand: as we are taught. Oh! how good doctrine Streams. For pilgrimage, Saints Worship, Retald Sins Maurilius Bish: of Rotomag When dead, in th'Temple brought begins This Doctrine from his bag. Receive the last Speech of your Pastour Deare By nature dead but am reviv'de, To tell you what I saw. Fore here I'st Soone of Life be Shriv'de. My Guides Whose Cloaths, and looks most faire And Speech most joyous were to mee Promis'd me going Eastward rare The Paradise of glee. We bended Jordan Ward when we the Saints Had worshipt at Jerusalem. Our Company increast. Supplaints Of Joy Sprang to me then. And when I would the River Cross, they said The Lord me Chargd my Veniall Sins Not by Confession washt off laid, Should now be purgd Strang things. For feare conceivd at Demons Looks: and soon Such host of horrid Spirits peare Brandishing Spears most sharp and fume Out Spewing firey geere. And all the aire seemd iron, and flaming fire. Where at I fell in horrid feare. Consult your Safety, then this Crier Said. And expired there. And hear another touching prayres for such As ly in purgatory pain. And of Good Works, whose merits much They say relieve the Same. While Mass was Saying o're a Monks dead Clay. He from the Beire leaps, God did curse. A Cross to kiss was tenderd nay He Spit upon. And worse. Revild our Lady: Singers Scornd. Said hee For Hells dread torments was ordaind. At which the Monks from torments free Themselves with Scourges maim'd. They fall to beate their breasts, and poure out prayers. The Wretched hell Scorcht Sinner now Findes ease its said and so repares And worthy things avows. Christs power did praise, Satan renounc'd, adore The Cross! Whoredom monkish shame. Confesst: God praisd: in peace great Store The next day dies again[.] These and Such Divell Doctrines more too many Filld with Satanick lies abound Too many truely Such are any But numberless are found. Truth Styles Such Doctrine, Marriage Prohibition And Prohibitions from Some meates. Yet the Salgunstade Superstition Some Seasons of them cheats[.] In Lent and other Stated times they do Forbid Some meats and none must wed. Hellbrand all marri'd Priest drives fro Their Work, or Wedlock bed, The Truth did shew the Harlot deckt with Gold. What hath been said makes good the Same. The Roman Church is deckt with folds Of Gold and Stones like flame. Truth said a Beast out of the Earth should rise With two horns like a lamb. We finde The Romish Church two Sharp swords ties Unto her Sides them minde. Truth said, the Whore should ride the beast, and act The power of the Pagan beast. Romes Harlot Church the Beast hath backt. And rides her West and East[.] And all the Power of Pagan Rome She Claims Sets up, plucks down: Kills, and revives. Nobles, Kings, Emperours. She maims Even at her Will their lives. Truth said, the Lamb hornd Beast would bid them make The Image of the First Beast and It Worship, yea, She'l make it Spake And bring to its Command. Rome's Church doth So. The first Beasts Image bright Is formd, and put into her hand Imperialiality or Might Her Shephards Staff doth Stand. And this she makes all to adore who ere, Small, Great, Subjects, Prince, Kings and Lords And who won't bow the knee though Peere Or King shall have a Coard. And thus Dealt Hildebrand in lofty trade With Henry the fourth, and his Brave Princes whom he Outchurch laid And Stript of Realm and bliss. Truth said, the Whore on beast back in her hand A Golden Cup held full of Filth. We have this Cup seen as it Stands Upon this Romish Shelfe. It hath a long While filling been but yet It will hold more. And more drops come. While filth is found it falls in it. Where lies the Totall Sum? The one and twentieth John his nose did drop John Baptist, and Saint Laurence eke Their yearly Lent into this pot For Christendom to keep. 1023Salgunstade's Synod's sirloine drops in't lay The fortnight lents which go before John Baptist day. And Christmass day. And Vigill Lents good Store. They fix the four greate annuary Lents Upon their dayes when they begin. Lent Weddens too their Crack-holes vent Their Ne Sints Sweet therein. The All-Souls Day Odilo's Daffling Dropt in this Cup. Oh! liquour pure. And Hildebrand's a Quackmoire Spring Into it venting Store. He taps his Spring, and hence these Streams in't trick Let no one of a Laick take An Abby or a Bishopprick. It's Symony. Off Shake't. Receive not Fornicators t'office trust. The Marri'de Minister he means. It's Nicolaitison busht By Peter Damian's Streams. Who either of these things shall ever do Let Excommunicated bee. And Such with Such partake that do, Shall Share of this decree. Let none on Sabbath dayes eat flesh but let Such as do teach unlawfull is. To work on Sabbath dayes be Set Condemned quite for this. These drops fall from his nose into this Cup. Also Liberiu's Holyday, Hee drew herein, whom others put With Hereticks, and lay. But most of all his frollick juyce doth run; And drops an Emperour in to't. And Empire too that fall in't plumb, Examples of good note. New orders now of Monkery oreflow And drop herein. John Gualbert drops Umbrosa Vallis in't and so New Monkery up hops[.] Stephen Avern drops them of Grandimont Into this Cup, and Bruno cast Queen Maries Reign doth as a Relick ly Of some Brave Web stain'd with a Crimson dy In blood most Choice of Choicest Martyres, and Of Innocents Whose Names here under stand. Mary Queen'd in the Realm Alectoes Whipe With flaming lashes she, (though first of Chips The Duke of Northumberland a full head shorter Who left Christ truth first and did seek to quarter In th'tents of Wicked men) and Crops off quite Sir John Gates head, Sir Thomas Palmers tite (Who bravely then professt Christs truth outright Lamenting he'd not livde more Gospell like). And did Lop of Sir Thomas Wyats' head The Duke of Suffolks too because they fled For to defend their Faith, and Cause by war But Failed in their Enterprize thus far Strikes off Lord Gilfords Head and his Choice Ladies (Lady Jane Grayes deserving of all Sages A Chiefe Esteem for Learning, Piety For Orthodox and sound Divinity And Pious Zeale, because King Edwards Will Made her his Heir and's Nobles to fulfill The same proclaimd her Queene, now dy she must Lord Gray with others too, when brought to dust The Queen, I say, she) down right to it fell To Whip with Lashes of the Flames of Hell.

About this time that Gentle woman brave Of Manciter Joyce Lewis, who to Save Christ truth in her, (when that her husbands hand Out brought her 'fore he forfeit would his band And lose an hundred pounds and in a touch He said he would not by her lose so much) Doth with a Chearfull Pleasant Lovely Face At Litchfield burn for Christ in shining Grace. September takes a Lot: its fires begin The Seventeenth day at Illington, wherein Ralfe Allerton, Dick Roth, James Austoo and His Pious wife are burnt by Boners hand Now also Margaret Thurston burned were At Colechester, and Agnes Bongeor there: Who being left behinde her mates she found Herselfe in tears for want of fire nigh drownd: The twenti'th day John Kurd was burnt to dust In thee, Northampton, for Christs Cause most just. And now about John ? Consum'de to ashes thus in Laxfield flame The twenty third Ci Orms at Norwich sit By faith for Glory burnt in Lollards pit John Warner too did feel this Firy Rod And Mr. Thomas Athoth, (man of God) John Ashdon Christian Grower, Holden too Together by Chichesters firy Crew Consumed were, though where and When they fell And in What Sort the Story doth not tell. October Silent is, or else provides But fewell for November and by Slides. November brings a fire Stick in its hand And lights a fire at Bury by Comand For Thomas Spurdance one that once had been A Servant to this Firy Bloody Queen The Eighteenth day in Smithfield Hallingdale And Sparrow who his yielding did bewaile, With Mr Gibson tall and proper who Did tell his Pigmy parator and foe That would pragmatically hall him like A Jayle Bird through the market as a Sight, And said he would Spite of his beard: poor ace That was so low he scarce could Se his face, That he if that he would not cease thus would. Writh of his Neck, then frighted left his hold Who when he came to Boner did assign Unto him for an answer Queries nine, For nine propounded to him. Now doth goe With other two by fire to Glory so. Thus with his fellows in Heroick wise He's made to Christ a Whole Burnt Sacrifice. In these Sad dayes there Were a Church Select London's Choice Golden Candle Stick erect. That Chose its Officers, for to dispense The Word, Christs Discipline, and Sacraments And did Elect the Worthy good Divine Mr John Rough her Pastour at that time. And Cuthbert Symson Deacon, and before Their Grievious blow they did Shut out of doore One Margret Mearing upon jealousy She would enthrall the Whole Society Now this Digression as a key before yee, Seems needfull to unlock the present Story. 1558 Mr John Rough for Sixteen years a Frier After a Priest, at last a godly Crier Of Christs Sound doctrine, which when he saw Cast into fire as Heresy by Law He fled to Norden then in Friezland And livd by knitting with his Wife, by hand, But coming thence to London yarn to buy He soon was calld by Christs Society, ? which he did accept. ? Margaret Mearing was eject, ? Secured as an Heretick ? Boner now will Shew his Usuall trick He Chargd with Saying he at Rome had ben Had Seen the Pope on Pick pack, Man of Sin, A Cardinall riding before his Whore A Popes Bull too, that did express therefore Licence for Stews and open Bawdery Even by the Popes approovd authority At which keen Boner flew in's face Cur like Pluckt off a piece of's beard in rage and Spite (Because he said't was true) To whom, Thou been At Rome said he? our holy Father Seen? And in the morn at Six a Clock next day He burnt him did and did not make delay. And so fulfilld the Vision Rough did see Two dayes before he was Securde for hee Dreamd then that he was forc't to Boner who Pluckt off his Beard, and did't in's fire throw, Then Saying, I may say, I've burnt here in My house a piece of Heretick: Which thing Thus Came to pass in part: by Boners ire. Also Decembers twenti'th Seconds fire Did burn with this Good man that Margret Mearing They did exclude their Church as too much fearing They Should be Snar'de by her, but now he's Caught She when none could him visit soon forth Sought Away Stiling herselfe his Sister so She was admitted and she did bestow Things needfull, and much Comfort too, and soon Was Ceised herselfe, and did his Cup assume. The twenty Eight that Faithfull Zealous Wise Choice Deacon of this Church of Gospell Sise And not prelatick, Cuthbert Symson who Bestowd all Care to keep the Church from Woe And Superstition, being at Islington Surprizd with Mr Rough, away begone, Unto the Tower: he hath two fingers tide Together then, he did an arrow 'bide Sawd swiftly through them till the blood out gusht After he'd on an Iron Wrack been trust Commonly Calld Scevingtons Gyves, and then Twice stretcht upon an other Wrack by them In all which torture, 'cause he would not Shew Them Such Choice ones the Which they knew he knew Thus Boner said, He was indeed a man Of greatest patience that ere 'fore him came. 'Bout midnight 'fore he was condemn'd he Saw Woman without a Candle to him draw Full nigh, after he'd three doors op't, and dart A Brightness, and a light that to his heart Was Joyfull and most Comfortable, then Said to him HAIL, and went away agen. This Sight he Saw, and joy whom his ? Did lively act when he the same exprest. This Cuthbert, with John Devenesh, Hugh Fox Also men pious, Choice, as firm as rocks In Smithfield burn together joyously Thanks be to God for Such, a rich Supply [.] Aprill must on her ninth at Hereford Kindle a Torch now in this fire unto'rd And Poor Will Nicoll halfe a foole esteemd Is made its Wick for Christ which now is teen'd. May also is attended on with flame As if her Shining Sun did want the Same, The ninteeth day therefore in Lollards pit At Norwich Hopton doth inkindle it And burns therein Will Seaman, Thomas Carman Brave Christians, and Thom Hudson, (Heare his Sermon) He first like pilgrim wander'd up and down To Shun the Storm, then home returnd to th'town Where 'mong his fagots halfe a yeare did Stay And Spent in Pray're, and reading all the day And being Sought for which he Saw, his Zeale Did flame, in Singing Psalmes, He'd not Conseale What he had met with: he Exhorted many And went abroad, defam'de the mass to any. And when he saw the Constables come to him Mine hour is Come said hee, and wellcome showing Said welcome, Friends now Welcome, You'st me bring To life in Christ. I thank God then, let him, For Mercy sake inable mee thereto And in a joyous frame did onward go, But at the Stake slipt out in Some strange Sort That made his fellow Martyres him Exhort For to hold on yea for Christ bowells Sake And Chearfull bee. But 'twas not feare did make Him slip his Chain, but Christ had hid his face Hence on his knees, and vemently for Grace Did pray, untill Christs Comfort in did throng, Then rising up thankt God, said now I'm Strong. Then to his Fellows went unto the Stake Who gladly Sufferd burning for Christs Sake. In Whitson week for Christ in Newgate die Thom: Taylor, and Math Withers (Blood will Cry). June though the turning Sun doth make her dayes Full warm, yet brings a Fagot for a blaze Now in her hand, as if not warm enough Unless a Martyres fire she up do puff. The fourteenth day in Smithfield burns she then. John Floyd, and Matthew Richarby, good men John Holiday with Robert Southam there With Rainold Eastland, Henry Pond, (Oh Deare) ? once a Stubborn Lad ? to all thats bad As Swearing, Dancing, Dicing, Games Excess To fencing, Banquitting Laciviousness Which he no bones of made, was Cocker'd in By Priestly Pardons, thus he walkt in Sin Till he had diced thirty pounds away. One night of's Master's tooke before th'Day. And at his Wits end now he thought therefore To trust unto his heels, and fly, Wherefore He in the morning, thus bespeake the maid (That often on him grave Reproofe had laid) Elizabeth, Oh would to God I'de took Thy gentle treating, Friendly good rebuke Then had I never to this shame have come. For I this night have lost no less a Sum Than thirty pounds all of my Masters Come And know not how to pay him, but assign Him now this Bill of Payment, and do pray Thee ? it to my Mistriss, and say I beg she would entreat my Master t'stay: And if I ever able be, I'l pay: Also to keep the matter from my friends Lest my Gray Father to the Grave it sends. And so departing was. But now behold The Pious Maid take thirty pounds down told, And treats him this, I'le Roger take your Bill, Here's so much mony, lend it you I will: But yet on this Condition, Promise mee That you'l Lewd Company, and Swearing flee But if at Cards and Dice you twelve pence play This Bill I will before my master lay Moreover you must promise me to tend Alhollows Lectures, and the Lords day Spend To heare the Sermons preacht at Pauls, and Cast Away thy Popish books, vain ballats wast. Get a New Testament, the Service Book Read reverently with fear the Scriptures, Look And Call on God for Grace and Pardon So You'st be Secured from all after woe. But this attended on but halfe the yeare And Roger did in wonderment appeare A new man was, earnest Professour and Detested Popery, vile mates aband Did Visit his old Father, made him see The naughtiness of Popish trumpery Receivd a Stock ofs Father, and pay made To Betty for her pane to whom he said In all thy Counsill, and thy friendship I No Recompence am able verily To render for the same unless it be By makeng thee my wife. Thus they agree. By whom the Child he had when ? It was baptized he to shun and fly. The Priests annointing greasy fingers go'th Into the Country, and the Infant doth Convay away. And Boner makes no bones But as a Cur on Carion ever prone Doth Seize upon his State as bread of life And cruelly doth treat his Pious Wife. And Roger now is quickly had in Coram Who bravely handycuffs it when before 'em. He plainly gave their own into their Dish And bravely did their fauning Charms out hiss And at their threats he matterd not a Straw And when they had after their firy Law Him Sentenc'd to be burn't when leave once gaind Bonner his butcher he thus entertaind. I said you had your power from God: Now I Do tell you this, that God hath heard the Cry Pourd out with teares of his Choice Servants which You persecute, as us, and thereto itch But this I dare be bold in God t'display, (Which by his Spirit I am mov'd to say) That God your Cruell hand shall Shorten so You'st for a time not grieve his Chu[r]ch: and lo, My Breathren Deare, even in a Short time, you Shall Well perceive this matter is most true For from this day you'le none in this place see By him with fire and Fagot tried bee: Said Boner in a fume that vile B[l]ood Sucker I see that mad as ever was Jeane butcher: A ruling Prophet thou in wrath wouldst bee Though thru and all thy mates would hangd me See. Yet I shall live to burn, and will burn all The Sort of you that in my hands do fall But lo, the Curst Cow hath Short horns its said. This Proverbs truth in Boner was displayde. For after Holland and his Fellows fell Smithfield no more did burn with fire from hell. But July in her hands a Fagot brings The which at Brainford to enflam begins. Wherein for Christs own Cause the fourteenth day These Six good men to ashes burning lay. One Stephen Cotton, Robert Mills, John Slade Wrighte, Dynes, and William Pikes. Which last is said, As in his garden he was reading there Four drops of blood fell on his Bible, cleare And very fresh: at which astonisht he Bespake his Wife thus, What thus must it bee That God will have four Sacrifices? I Se he will have blood. His Will be done hereby. God give me grace to bide the triall here And went to pray're counting the day drew neere [.] ? had his fat guts tirde with Rod ? hopt had Wills and Hinshaw with loving God Wh[e]n Dole did dy for Christ in Bury Jayle. And Richard Yeoman Hadlys Curate, naile That still held fast, the tenth day Cruelly They burnt at Norwich, cause he'd not back fly. And now about John Alcock who Supplide A Readers place at Hadly, must abide In Newgate Prison, and Stuck close unto The truth in Spite of what the Pope could do, Is in revenge in lowest Dungeon cast And Dying's in a Dunghill rakt at last. The Nineteenth day brave Mr. Benbridge who In Stately ray unto the Stake did goe Where being urg'd now to recant did Say Away, thou Babylonian, away Yet in the torturing fire did make this Cry, I do recant, Hence Seaton Suddenly Made him Subscribe unto his Cursed bill, Which buggling he did against his Will And's to the Prison had again where hee Bewails his Recantation, and to free His Conscience did to Docter Seaton write His Recantation of it. Hence venom Spite On that day Sevnight had him to the Stake And rather brasd than burnt him for Christ Sake. Thus through the Papish Plaguy venom ire He Suffered two Martyrdoms by fire. Now Augusts firy hands falls fingering And at St. Edmondsbury soon doe fling John Cooke, James Ashly too and Robert Miles With Alexander Lane upon her Piles Of burning fire that they an Offring should Be made and burnt up for the truth they hold [.] Novembers fourth at Ipswich burn their must And therefore Alexander Gouch is thrust There in the fire, and brave Alice Driver who Did when a girle off drive her fathers plough Now duncd her judges by their own Concession And o're them Crowd, and Silenc't them in Session: And said, you cant with all your Skill withstand Christs Spirit in mee a poore Woman: and Being Condemd she to the prison went As joyfull as a Singing Bird, intent On Singing Praise to God and at the Stake The Chain being put about her neck thus Spake Oh! here's a goodly neckerchiefe, and Cride Blessed be God for't: and by fire so dide. And now about at Bury were Calcinde Three holy Martyres, of a gracious minde John David, and his brother Henry With one whose name was Philip Humfry. And day the tenth, Six dayes before did slip Alecto's Hand of[f] from her flaming whip, Harpsfield Entoom'd in Canterburys flame Kate Tinley, and Alice Snoth, John Herst by name Christopher Brown, John Cornford too whose Zeale Most vemently brake forth flam'd such a peale Within their Ears which they left on record We in the name of Jesus Christ our Lord The Son of the most Mighty God, and by His Holy Spirits Power, and 'Thority Of's holy Catholick, 'Postolick Church Do here give into Satans hands to lurch To be destroy'd, the bodies of all those Blasphemers and all Hereticks, his foes That Errour 'gainst's most holy word mentain Or do Condemn for Heresy to flame His own most Holy Truth, to th'mentainance Thus of a false Church, or for to advance A feignd Religion. So that by this Rod Of thy just judgments, oh most Mighty God, Against thy Cruell Adversaries here Thy true Religion may be known, full Cleare, To thy Greate Glory, and our Consolation, And to the Edifying all our Nation. Be't So, good Lord. Amen. Then at the Stake They all in earnest prayer to God thus Spake Begging of God, their blood might be the last That Should be Shed. This was their dying Cast. Which God did grant: for down their Sentence came Upon the Queen who with her took the flame To hell to serve her there, no Sparke we finde The Lord be praisd, to burn a Saint behinde. In this Sad Catalogue Some gleanings are Pickt up, and out of place, this is their fare. One Goodwy Prest a poor poor woman loe And as unpromising as most do show, Yet filld with Holy Things of God such Store Its very rare to finde in any more, Yea was a Woman Constant in Christs Faith As Ever was upon the earth, For Saith Was burnt at Exeter by Trouble-Vile Because she would not from the truth recoyle And Sharpe, with Hale burning at Bristall lay In fifty Seven th'Seventh day of May. And Benion too burnt for the Same Cause there August the twenty Seventh of that yeare. ? at Bristow burn'd ? 'cause from Christ hed not be turnd In th'latter dayes of Mary, Richard Snell And John his brother loving Christs truth well ?kins did Cast in Richmond Jayle untill Their toes were rotted off: but past his Skill To bring them off from Christ, yet brought to pass By force to bring them where one heard the Mass: But he departing did himselfe bewaile And drownd himselfe soon after in the Swaile. But John was Sentenced by Dakins Vile Who to his house returnd, and in the While Was summon'd hence by death who to the fire Condemned had this martyre to expire Who in the flame Christ help me Cride whereto One said Oh hold fast there. And we also Will for thee pray. And he within this flame Ended his mortall Life for Christ Choice name[.] Here other Martyres that did Scape ? Recorded Stand as Sentenc't for Christs name. At Sals'bury John Hunt, and Richard White Whose grave reproofe with Such a touch did light On Doctor Blackstone who abused Such As ancient Doctours were, yea very much As made him Quake and tremble, and sit down With hands and knees to fork up his Shaking Crown. Were Sentenc't and deliver'd to be burnt By Capon B, and Geffery (who Spurn'd Away the truth,) his Chancellour, got too De Combarendo-Writ-Heretico Ith'hand of Mr. Mitchell th'Under Shreve, Who made it Heretick, and did bequeath It to fire, and four dayes thence doth dy This Chancellour, While Hunt, and White (who ly In low, darke Dungeon) in a flood of teares Brake forth, they knew not why, as it appears, When down they kneeld to prayre; in Such a wise As did Constrain them prayerless up to rise. But 'twas while Geffry lay dying, who Must with the Bishop Cited hence also Attend the firy Queen in flames to Hell. Hence liberty did rise as they down fell. Again, John Fatty whose Vile Wife Complain'd Against him twice, in Lollards Tower Sustain'd Intollerable pain as hanging in The Stocks for fifteen dayes in torturing By one sides leg and arm sometime, Sometime Ev'n by the others, till his boy whose Crime Replying to a Priest that to him said Thy Father is an Heretick Speech made My father is no Heretick: But harke You are an Heretick you've Balams marke Brought Boners Scourge upon him till in red Gore blood he was all o're, and then was had Unto his Father in this plight to See This needs must grievous to his bowells bee. Hence now the Father's set at liberty. But yet [the] Child in fourteen dayes did dy. Again in Drapers Hall Dick Wilmot and One Thomas Fairfax were with Cords so tan'd That Wilmot could not ly in bed for Sores For Six night[s] going Cause they hate Rome[s] whore [.] Then Thomas Green after he'd felt their Power In Boners Colehouse, and in Lollard Tower Some months in manacles, and Stocks full Sore Was sorely Scourgd, and let goe out of Doore [.] Hoe, hoe thou Ath'ist Vile Come here ?

And Bishop Morgan Farrars firy judge That burnt him, and Succeeded him, the grudge Of Justice Gods right hand did take him by The throat, that made his Swallowd food up fly Back through his nose, or mouth while life remain'd Most horrible to see, till death him gaind. The Sheriff Leason too that burnt him and His Cattle fetcht out of his Servants hand, Found divers of them in his Pastures eate No grass but bellowd, roard, and dyde for meate. Justice did lay her hands on Nightingaile In Crandall Pulpet as he told his tale Against his Text he tooke which thus doth say He that doth say he hath no Sin (nay, nay) He is a Liar. Truth is not in him Presum'd to say, he was as Cleare from Sin As at the Font Stone, nay an[d] in the night That born he was. He had a Pardon right Of Poole, the Cardinall, who did enjoyn Him now to read the Bull of all Such kine.

One Side Cought ? Paulsy dead that for eight years he could Not turn himselfe in bed, his hands tide hold And a Devouring hunger him devours ? Strange to see how now he things down poures He never was released from his band So long as in his glass was left a Sand. Old Hubberdin of Oxford who did ball ?t Luther, and Melancthon, Zwinglius all Good men, Faith, Tindall, Latimer did strive To keep up piping popery alive [S]pide youngsters dancing in the Church yard, made The Bell to ring, and to his Dancing trade [H]e in the Pulpet fell; the Doctors old ?alls out to dance against these Worthies told ?hen to't he goes, Cries Pipe up Hubbardin [A]nd now dance Christ, Dance Peter, Paul, Austin, Ambrose, and Jerom, all as in a round Against his Hereticks, (Oh, Grace Profound!) But marke this Dance, while he thus leapt and danc'te Alice herself did take her round, advanc'te; ? the Pulpet and its Dancer, who ? in't, His neck not broken though ? bruisd his heavy bones; ? soon goe from him in's groas. Harke hark how Justice goes to ? Queen Mary's Chancellour Curst Gardener That Bloody Butcher who his hands did Stain In Martyres Blood and on them spit forth flame. Did thirst for Lady Betty's Blood and would Not sit down with the Duke of Norfolk Old To dinner till his man from Oxford came Assuring him he saw Blesst Ridlys flame And Father Latimers. Now lets said hee To dinner goe. And sitting Down with glee Fell merrily upon his meat: but yet Before this bloody Tyrant much had bit, The Dreadfull Stroke of Gods right hand doth fall And from his merry Cheer, and meat him call. He's from his banquet to his bed brought where Most torturings pains feed on him for good Cheer For fifteen dayes at once: and 'Bargoe's lay Upon all ports. Hence nothing Sayles away. All Passages are Stopt. His Dung is made Dry fewell, fagots now to burn this blade His Urin is Secur'de and boyld up to A Scalding Lye him to enflame also. In that Sad flame Gods terrours too within Chichesters Bishop Day Comes seeks to bring Him ease from that free justifying Grace I'th'blood of Christ. Oh Curst Catiff what place This thy Sheat Anchor; yet drive from it all With fire, and fagot: yet now to it Call This Bloodhound?

And must it still from others forced bee? The fire doth not go out it grows more strong Doth Stigmatize his black blasphemous tongue That for his black mouth its too big and black Hangs out, and will not be Confind in that.

The Fines which Justice laid on Mall the Queen Do upon Record Stand and may be Seen And red of all. Who though of Womans shew Seems rather flaming Fire from hell that flew, Who burnt her Subject[s] just, like rotten Sticks Pretending they were Divell-Hereticks The like was never known: but God brought down The Glory and the Splendour of her Crown. [Af]ter her Vow to Protestants she broke ? followd her attemps with fearfull Stroaks. ?rst soon he burnt the Ship called Great Henry: ? Such in Europe all for to miscarry. All her desird attempts could never bring The Crown to make her Philip Englands King. Such Dearth there was too in the land forlorn That many towns eate acorn bread for Corn: Henry the third the 'leventh king that reignd Did Calice win, which in his race remain'd Till Mary Queen th' 'leventh of his, but shee Hath lost the Same. And now it lost must bee. Again she seems to be with Child, and loe Thanksgiving for the Same all England do. The time comes on, She out doth Cry, there's born A joyous Son, that proves the birth of Scorn. The Chauntrys keep thangsgiving, Chaunt out praise ?ing, Drums beate, and lusty Bonefires blaze, ? sound, and Canon play, at th'Tower ??vy then at Sea, what shoure Doth reach the Hague, and make ?

No Babe is born, nor can be gaind, whose fame Whereof makes her become a Publick Shame Disgraced thus Philip doth from her go And leaves her with her babe, a further woe Sickness comes on: Sorrows Crowd in which smart. Her losing Calice builds it in her heart. Her Death draws on, her Soul expires an host Of flames she made calld are to tend her Ghost. Gods Justice also in a glorious Shine Did set upon the Sheriffs man her fine Who did revile James Abbs as he did goe Unto the Stake for Christ, and did bestow His Cloaths, and gracious Exhortations gave To Such as did Stand by their Souls to Save. So that this wretched fellow scorning bad The people not believe him: He was mad. He was an Heretick: Spake Heresy. And in this wise he Spake revilingly. But now behold when Abbes began to burn The hand of Justice did upon him turn. He now fell mad: pulls off his Shooes and Cloaths And throws them all away, and this forth throws So did James Abbs, true Servant here of God Did round about the town of Bury, plod And said James Abbs is Sav'd; but I am Damnd The Sheriff now amaizd, doth give Command To take and ty him, keeps him in the Darke Puts on his Cloath: yet when they did depart He plucks them off again, casts them away And saith again thus did James Abbs, doth say He was Gods Servant true and Saved is But I am damnd. Wherefore the Priest at this Comes to him with his Crucifix, and toyes Which baggage he when he beheld defies, As Cause of his Damnation, which he wav'd And said James Abbs a good man was and Sav'd And so abode untill his Dying day Which soon ore tooke him, and him tooke away. ?
