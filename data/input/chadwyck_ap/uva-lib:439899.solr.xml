      <field name="fulltext">THE SINGER. A star into our twilight fell, 'Mong peasant homes in vales remote; Men marvelled not till all the dell Was waked as by a bugle-note. They wondered at the wild-eyed boy, And drank his song like draughts of wine; And yet, amid their new-born joy, They bade him tend the herds and swine. But he knew neither swine nor herds,â His shepherd soul was otherwhere; The flocks he tended were the birds, And stars that fill the folds of air. To sweeter song the wind would melt That fanned him with its perfumed wing; Flowers thronged his path as if they felt The warm and flashing feet of Spring. The brooklet flung its ringlets wide, And leapt to him, and kept his pace,â Sang when he sang, and when he sighed, Turned up to him its starry face. Through many a dawn and noon and night, The singing boy still kept his course; For in his heart that meteor light Still burned with all its natal force. He sang,ânor cherished thought of care,â As when, upon the garden-vine, A bluebird thrills the April air, Regardless of the herds and swine. The children in their May-time plays, The maidens in their rosy hours, And matrons in their autumn days, All heard and flung him praise or flowers. And Age, to chimney-nooks beguiled, Caught the sweet music's tender closes, And, gazing on the embers, smiled As on a bed of summer roses. And many a heart, by hope forsook, Received his song through depths of pain, As the dry channels of a brook The freshness of a summer rain. But when he looked for house or bread, The stewards of earth's oil and wine Shook sternly the reproving head, And bade him tend the herds and swine. He strayed into the harvest plains, And 'mid the sultry windrows sung, Till glowing girls and swarthy swains Caught music from his charmÃ©d tongue,â Caught music that from heart to brain Went thrilling with delicious measure, Till toil, which late had seemed a pain, Became a sweet Arcadian pleasure. The farmer, at the day's decline, Sat listening till the eve was late; Then, offering neither bread nor wine, Arose, and barred the outer gate,â And said, âWould you have where to sleep, On wholesome straw, good brother mine, You need but plough, and sow, and reap, And daily tend the herds and swine.â The poet's locks shook out reply; He turned him gayly down the hill; Yet left a light which shall not die, A sunshine on the farmer's sill. He strewed the vale with flowers of song; He filled the homes with lighter grace, Which round those hearthstones lingered long, And still makes beautiful the place. The country, hamlet, and the town Grew wiser, better, for his songs;â The roaring city could not drown The voice that to the world belongs. To beds of pain, to rooms of death, The soft and solemn music stole, And soothed the dying with its breath, And passed into the mourner's soul. And yet what was the poet's meed? Such, Bard of Alloway, was thine! The soul that sings, the heart must bleed, Or tend the common herds and swine. The nation heard his patriot lays, And rung them, like an anthem, round, Till Freedom waved her branch of bays, Wherewith the world shall yet be crowned. His war-songs fired the battle-host, His mottoes on their banners burned; And when the foe had fled the coast, Wild with his songs the troops returned. Then at the feast's triumphal board, His thrilling music cheered the wine;â But when the singer asked reward, They pointed to the herds and swine. âWhat! he a bard? Then bid him go And beg,âit is the poet's trade! Dan Homer was the first to show The rank for which the bards were made! âA living bard! What's he to us? A bard, to live, must first be dead! And when he dies, we may discuss To whom belongs the poet's head!â 'Neath suns that burn, through storms that drench, He went, an outcast from his birth, Still singing,âfor they could not quench The fire that was not born of earth. At last, behind cold prison-bars, By colder natures unforgiven, His frail dust starved! but 'mid the stars Its spirit found its native heaven. Now, when a meteor-spark, forlorn, Descends upon its fiery wing, I sigh to think a soul is born, Perchance, to suffer and to sing:â Its own heart a consuming pyre Of flame, to brighten and refine:â A singer, in the starry choir, That will not tend the herds and swine. LYRIC POEMS. MY HERMITAGE. Within a wood, one summer's day, And in a hollow, ancient trunk, I shut me from the world away, To live as lives a hermit monk. My cell a ghostly sycamore, The roots and boughs were dead with age; Decay had carved the gothic door Which looked into my hermitage. My library was large and full, Where, ever as a hermit plods, I read until my eyes were dull With tears; for all those tomes were God's. The vine that at my doorway swung Had verses writ on every leaf, The very songs the bright bees sung In honey-seeking visits briefâ Not briefâthough each stayed never longâ So rapidly they came and went No pause was left in all their song, For while they borrowed still they lent. All day the woodland minstrels sangâ Small feet were in the leaves astirâ And often o'er my doorway rang The tap of a blue-winged visiter. Afar the stately river swayed, And poured itself in giant swells, While here the brooklet danced and played, And gayly rung its liquid bells. The springs gave me their crystal flood, And my contentment made it wineâ And oft I found what kingly food Grew on the world-forgotten vine. The moss, or weed, or running flower, Too humble in their hope to climb, Had in themselves the lovely power To make me happier for the time. And when the starry night came by, And stooping looked into my cell, Then all between the earth and sky Was circled in a holier spell. A height, and depth, and breadth sublime O'erspread the scene, and reached the stars, Until Eternity and Time Seemed drowning their dividing bars. And voices which the day ne'er hears, And visions which the sun ne'er sees, From earth and from the distant spheres, Came on the moonlight and the breeze. Thus day and night my spirit grew In love with that which round me shone, Until my calm heart fully knew The joy it is to be alone. The time went byâtill one fair dawn I saw against the eastern fires A visionary city drawn, With dusky lines of domes and spires. The wind in sad and fitful spells Blew o'er it from the gates of morn, Till I could clearly hear the bells That rung above a world forlorn. And well I listened to their voice, And deeply pondered what they saidâ Till I aroseâthere was no choiceâ I went while yet the east was red. My wakened heart for utterance yearnedâ The clamorous wind had broke the spellâ I needs must teach what I had learned Within my simple woodland cell. AN INVITATION. INSCRIBED TO GEORGE HAMMERSLEY. Come thou, my friend;âthe cool autumnal eves About the hearth have drawn their magic rings; There, while his song of peace the cricket weaves, The simmering hickory sings. The winds unkennelled round the casements whine, The sheltered hound makes answer in his dream, And in the hayloft, hark, the cock at nine, Crows from the dusty beam. The leafless branches chafe the roof all night, And through the house the troubled noises go, While, like a ghostly presence, thin and white, The frost foretells the snow. The muffled owl within the swaying elm Thrills all the air with sadness as he swings, Till sorrow seems to spread her shadowy realm About all outward things. Come, then, my friend, and this shall seem no moreâ Come when October walks his red domain, Or when November from his windy floor Winnows the hail and rain: And when old Winter through his fingers numb Blows till his breathings on the windows gleam; And when the mill-wheel spiked with ice is dumb Within the neighboring stream: Then come, for nights like these have power to wake The calm delight no others may impart. When round the fire true souls communing make A summer in the heart. And I will weave athwart the mystic gloom. With hand grown weird in strange romance, for thee, Bright webs of fancy from the golden loom Of charmÃ©d Poesy. And let no censure in thy looks be shown, That I, with hands adventurous and bold, Should grasp the enchanted shuttle which was thrown Through mightier warps of old. A SONG. Bring me the juice of the honey fruit, The large, translucent, amber-hued, Rare grapes of southern isles, to suit The luxury that fills my mood. And bring me only such as grew Where fairest maidens tend the bowers, And only fed by rain and dew Which first had bathed a bank of flowers. They must have hung on spicy trees In airs of far enchanted vales, And all night heard the ecstasies Of noble-throated nightingales: So that the virtues which belong To flowers may therein tasted be, And that which hath been thrilled with song May give a thrill of song to me. For I would wake that string for thee Which hath too long in silence hung, And sweeter than all else should be The song which in thy praise is sung. THE DESERTED ROAD. Ancient road, that wind'st deserted Through the level of the vale, Sweeping toward the crowded market Like a stream without a sail; Standing by thee, I look backward, And, as in the light of dreams, See the years descend and vanish, Like thy tented wains and teams. Here I stroll along the village As in youth's departed morn: But I miss the crowded coaches, And the driver's bugle-hornâ Miss the crowd of jovial teamsters Filling buckets at the wells, With their wains from Conestoga, And their orchestras of bells. To the mossy way-side tavern Comes the noisy throng no more, And the faded sign, complaining, Swings, unnoticed, at the door; While the old, decrepit tollman, Waiting for the few who pass, Reads the melancholy story In the thickly springing grass. Ancient highway, thou art vanquished: The usurper of the vale Rolls in fiery, iron rattle, Exultations on the gale. Thou art vanquished and neglected; But the good which thou hast done, Though by man it be forgotten, Shall be deathless as the sun. Though neglected, gray and grassy, Still I pray that my decline May be through as vernal valleys And as blest a calm as thine. A BUTTERFLY IN THE CITY. Dear transient spirit of the fields, Thou com'st without distrust, To fan the sunshine of our streets Among the noise and dust. Thou leadest in thy wavering flight My footsteps unaware, Until I seem to walk the vales And breathe thy native air. And thou hast fed upon the flowers, And drained their honeyed springs, Till every tender hue they wore Is blooming on thy wings. I bless the fresh and flowery light Thou bringest to the town, But tremble lest the hot turmoil Have power to weigh thee down; For thou art like the poet's song, Arrayed in holiest dyes, Though it hath drained the honeyed wells Of flowers of Paradise, Though it hath brought celestial hues To light the ways of life, The dust shall weigh its pinions down Amid the noisy strife. And yet, perchance, some kindred soul May see its glory shine, And feel its wings within his heart As bright as I do thine. THE WAY-SIDE SPRING. Fair dweller by the dusty way, Bright saint within a mossy shrine, The tribute of a heart to-day Weary and worn is thine! The earliest blossoms of the year, The sweet-brier and the violet, The pious hand of Spring has here Upon thy altar set. And not alone to thee is given The homage of the pilgrim's kneeâ But oft the sweetest birds of heaven Glide down and sing to thee. Here daily from his beechen cell The hermit squirrel steals to drink, And flocks which cluster to their bell Recline along thy brink. And here the wagoner blocks his wheels, To quaff the cool and generous boon; Here from the sultry harvest-fields The reapers rest at noon. And oft the beggar masked with tan, In rusty garments gray with dust, Here sits and dips his little can, And breaks his scanty crust; And, lulled beside thy whispering stream, Oft drops to slumber unawares, And sees the angel of his dream Upon celestial stairs. Dear dweller by the dusty way, Thou saint within a mossy shrine, The tribute of a heart to-day Weary and worn is thine! A-MAYING. PART FIRST. Now sitting under orchard limbs, When all the world has gone a-Maying, Oh, how the fancy soars and skims, With yonder fitful swallow playing! Like snowy tents, the trees in bloom Stand courting every bee that's winging; And in the depths of their perfume A whole community is singing. The wind upon these murmuring bowers, From out the fields of clover blowing, Shakes down a storm of scented flowers, As if to fright me with its snowing. The bluebird, which from Southern skies Takes yearly on his wings their azure, Now through the falling blossoms flies, And thrills the passing air with pleasure. Oh, would that I could thus take flight, And be, like him, the earliest comer, That all should hear me with delight, And bless the song that promised summer! Along the quiet, neighboring town, The children chant their gladsome marches; Each with a woodland-gathered crown.â Some under flowery iris-arches. Afar and near the music swellsâ The breeze is glad to waft their singing, For never chime of fairy bells Filled poet's soul with sweeter ringing. See where they go!âa very cloud With rosy pleasure overladen! Sure Flora hath to-day endowed With her own form each little maiden. A gladness thrills the waiting grove While they go singing gayly over;â The very fields are waked to love, And nod them welcome with the clover. And every flower where stoops the breeze With just enough of force to stir it, Rings out its little chime of bees, In pleasure from its vernal turret. The springs release their fullest floods, From earth's o'erflowing heart, unbidden. The woodlands ope their latest buds, There's not a leaf that may be hidden. Yes, surely there's a love abroad, Through every nerve of nature playing,â And all between the sky and sod, All, all the world has gone a-Maying! SECOND PART. Oh, wherefore do I sit and give My fancy up to idle playing? Too well I know the half who liveâ One-half the world is NOT a-Maying. Where are the dwellers of the lanes, The alleys of the stifled city? Where the waste forms whose sad remains Woo Death to come for very pity? Where they who tend the busy loom, With pallid cheek and torn apparel? The buds they weave will never bloom, Their staring birds will never carol. It may be at the thought, their souls Are crushed to-day in their abasement,â Oh, better they should house with owls, With poison vines about their casement! And where the young of every size The factories draw from every by-way, Whose violets are each other's eyes, But dull as by a dusty highway?â Whose cotton lilies only grow 'Mid whirring wheels, on jarring spindles, Their roses in the hectic glow To tell how fast the small life dwindles? Or she who plies the midnight thread The while her orphan ones are sleeping, And trembles lest, for want of bread, They start from troubled dreams to weeping? Not all the floral wealth that sweeps The brow of May in splendor shining, Were worth to her the crust that keeps Her little ones to-day from pining. Where are the dusky miners? they Who, even in the earth descending, Know well the night before their May Is one which has in life no ending? To them 'tis still a joy, I ween, To know, while through the darkness going, That o'er their heads the smiling queen Stands with her countless garlands glowing. Oh, ye who toil in living tombs Of light or darkâno rest receiving, Far o'er your heads a May-time bloomsâ Oh, then be patient and believing. Be patientâwhen Earth's winter fails, The weary night which keeps ye stayingâ Then through the broad celestial vales Your spirits shall go out a-Maying! THE SUMMER SHOWER. Before the stout harvesters falleth the grain, As when the strong storm-wind is reaping the plain; And loiters the boy in the briery lane; But yonder aslant comes the silvery rain, Like a long line of spears brightly burnished and tall. Adown the white highway, like cavalry fleet, It dashes the dust with its numberless feet. Like a murmurless school, in their leafy retreat, The wild birds sit listening the drops round them beat, And the boy crouches close to the blackberry wall. The swallows alone take the storm on their wing, And, taunting the tree-sheltered laborers, sing. Like pebbles the rain breaks the face of the spring, While a bubble darts up from each widening ring; And the boy, in dismay, hears the loud shower fall. But soon are the harvesters tossing the sheaves; The robin darts out from its bower of leaves; The wren peereth forth from the moss-covered eaves; And the rain-spattered urchin now gladly perceives That the beautiful bow bendeth over them all. INEZ. Down behind the hidden village, fringed around with hazel brake, (Like a holy hermit dreaming, half asleep and half awake, One who loveth the sweet quiet for the happy quiet's sake,) Dozing, murmuring in its visions, lay the heaven-enamored lake. And within a dell, where shadows through the brightest days abide, Like the silvery swimming gossamer by breezes scattered wide, Fell a shining skein of water that ran down the lakelet's side, As within the brain by beauty lulled, a pleasant thought may glide. When the sinking sun of August, growing large in the decline, Shot his arrows long and golden through the maple and the pine; And the russet-thrush fled singing from the alder to the vine, While the cat-bird in the hazel gave its melancholy whine; And the little squirrel chattered, peering round the hickory bole, And, a-sudden like a meteor, gleamed along the oriole;â There I walked beside fair Inez, and her gentle beauty stole Like the scene athwart my senses, like the sunshine through my soul. And her fairy feet that pressed the leaves, a pleasant music made, And they dimpled the sweet beds of moss with blossoms thick inlaid:â There I told her old romances, and with love's sweet woe we played, Till fair Inez' eyes, like evening, held the dew beneath their shade. There I wove for her love-ballads, such as lover only weaves, Till she sighed and grieved, as only mild and loving maiden grieves; And to hide her tears she stooped to glean the violets from the leaves, As of old sweet Ruth went gleaning 'mid the oriental sheaves. Down we walked beside the lakelet:âgazing deep into her eye, There I told her all my passion! With a sudden blush and sigh, Turning half away with look askant, she only made reply, âHow deep within the water glows the happy evening sky!â Then I asked her if she loved me, and our hands met each in each, And the dainty, sighing ripples seemed to listen up the reach; While thus slowly with a hazel wand she wrote along the beach, âLove, like the sky, lies deepest ere the heart is stirred to speech.â Thus I gained the love of Inezâthus I won her gentle hand; And our paths now lie together, as our footprints on the strand; We have vowed to love each other in the golden morning land, When our names from earth have vanished, like the writing from the sand! SUNLIGHT ON THE THRESHOLD. Dear Mary, I remember yet The day when first we rode together, Through groves where grew the violet, For it was in the Maying weather. And I remember how the woods Were filled with love's delightful chorus; How in the scented air the buds, Like our young hearts, were swelling o'er us. The little birds, in tuneful play, Along the fence before us fluttered; The robin hopped across the way, Then turned to hear the words we uttered! We stopped beside the willow-brook, That trickled through its bed of rushes; While timidly the reins you took, I gathered blooms from brier bushes; And one I placed, with fingers meek, Within your little airy bonnet; But then I looked and saw your cheekâ Another rose was blooming on it! Some miles beyond the village lay, Where pleasures were in wait to wreathe us; While swiftly flew the hours away, As swiftly flew the road beneath us. How gladly we beheld arise, Across the hill, the village steeple; Then met the urchins' wondering eyes, And gaze of window-peering people! The dusty coach that brought the mail, Before the office-door was standing; Beyond, the blacksmith, gray and hale. With burning tire the wheel was banding. We passed some fruit-treesâafter these A bedded garden lying sunward; Then saw, beneath three aged trees, The parsonage a little onward. A modest building, somewhat gray, Escaped from time, from storm, disaster; The very threshold worn away With feet of those who'd sought the pastor. And standing on the threshold there, We saw a child of angel lightness; Her soul-lit faceâher form of air, Outshone the sunlight with her brightness! As then she stood I see her nowâ In years perchance a half a dozenâ And, Mary, you remember how She ran to you and called you âcousinâ? As then, I see her slender size, Her flowing locks upon her shoulderâ A six years' loss to Paradise, And ne'er on earth the child grew older! Three times the flowers have dropped away, Three winters glided gayly o'er us, Since here upon that morn in May The little maiden stood before us. These are the elms, and this the door, With trailing woodbine overshaded; But from the step, for evermore, The sunlight of that child has faded! MIDNIGHT. The moon looks down on a world of snow, And the midnight lamp is burning low, And the fading embers mildly glow In their bed of ashes soft and deep; All, all is still as the hour of death; I only hear what the old clock saith, And the mother and infant's easy breath, That flows from the holy land of Sleep. Say on, old clockâI love you well, For your silver chime, and the truths you tell, Your every stroke is but the knell Of hope, or sorrow buried deep; Say onâbut only let me hear The sound most sweet to my listening ear, The child and the mother breathing clear Within the harvest-fields of Sleep. Thou watchman, on thy lonely round, I thank thee for that warning sound; The clarion cock and the baying hound Not less their dreary vigils keep; Still hearkening, I will love you all, While in each silent interval I hear those dear breasts rise and fall Upon the airy tide of Sleep. Old world, on time's benighted stream Sweep down till the stars of morning beam From orient shoresânor break the dream That calms my love to pleasure deep; Roll on, and give my Bud and Rose The fulness of thy best repose, The blessedness which only flows Along the silent realms of Sleep. THE LIGHT OF OUR HOME. Oh, thou whose beauty on us beams With glimpses of celestial light; Thou halo of our waking dreams, And early star that crown'st our night; Thy light is magic where it falls; To thee the deepest shadow yields; Thou bring'st unto these dreary halls The lustre of the summer fields. There is a freedom in thy looks To make the prisoned heart rejoice;â In thy blue eyes I see the brooks, And hear their music in thy voice. And every sweetest bird that sings Hath poured a charm upon thy tongue; And where the bee enamored clings, There surely thou in love hast clung:â For when I hear thy laughter free, And see thy morning-lighted hair, As in a dream at once I see Fair upland realms and valleys fair. I see thy feet empearled with dews, The violet's and the lily's loss; And where the waving woodland wooes Thou lead'st me over beds of moss;â And by the busy runnel's side, Whose waters, like a bird afraid, Dart from their fount, and, flashing, glide Athwart the sunshine and the shade. Or larger streams our steps beguile;â We see the cascade, broad and fair, Dashed headlong down to foam, the while Its iris-spirit leaps to air! Alas! as by a loud alarm, The fancied turmoil of the falls Hath driven me back and broke the charm Which led me from these alien walls:â Yes, alien, dearest child, are these Close city walls to thee and me: My homestead was embowered with trees, And such thy heritage should be:â And shall be;âI will make for thee A home within my native vale, Where every brook and ancient tree Shall whisper some long-treasured tale. Now once again I see thee stand, As down the future years I gaze, The fairest maiden of the land, The spirit of those sylvan ways. And in thy looks again I trace The light of her who gave thee birth; She who endowed thy form and face With glory which is not of Earth. And as I gaze upon her now, My heart sends up a prayer for thee, That thou mayest wear upon thy brow The light which now she beams on me. THE TWO DOVES. When the Spring's delightful store Brought the bluebirds to our bowers, And the poplar at the door Shook the fragrance from its flowers, Then there came two wedded doves, And they built among the limbs, And the murmur of their loves Fell like mellow, distant hymns; There, until the Spring had flown, Did they sit and sing alone, In the broad and flowery branches. With the scented Summer breeze How their music swam around, Till my spirit sailed the seas Of enchanted realms of sound! âSoul,â said I, âthy dream of youth Is not fancy, nor deceives, For I hear Love's blissful truth Prophesied among the leaves; Therefore till the Summer's flown Sit and sing, but not alone, In the broad and flowery branches.â Then the harvest came and went, And the Autumn marshalled down All his host, and spread his tent Over fields and forests brown; Then the doves, one evening, hied To their old accustomed nest; One went up, but drooped and died, With an arrow in its breastâ Died and dropped; while there, alone, Sat the other, making moan, In the broad and withering branches. There it sat and mourned its mate, With a never-ending moan, Till I thought perchance its fate Was prophetic of my own: And at each lament I heard, How the tears sprang to my eyes! O! I could have clasped the bird, And communed with it in sighs; But it droopedâand with a moan, Closed its eyes, and there, alone, Dropped from out the leafless branches. I beheld it on the ground, Press the brown leaves, cold and dead, And my brain went round and round, And I clasped my throbbing head, While thus spake a voice of Love: âRise, thou timid spirit, rise! Earth has claimed the fallen doveâ But thy soul shall cleave the skies; While the angel, earlier flown, Shall sit waiting thee, alone, In the green eternal branches!â SOLEMN VOICES. I heard from out the dreary realms of Sorrow The various tongues of Woe:â One said, âIs there a hope in the to-morrow?â And many answered, âNo!â And they arose and mingled their loud voices, And cried in bitter breath, âIn all our joys the Past alone rejoices,â There is no joy but Death. âOh dreadful Past, beyond thy midnight portal Thou hast usurped our peace; And if the angel Memory be immortal, When shall this anguish cease?â And suddenly within the darkened distance The solemn Past replied, âIn my domains your joys have no existence, Your hopes they have not died! âNought comes to me except those ghosts detested, Phantoms of Wrong and Pain; But whatsoe'er Affection hath invested, Th' eternal years retain. âThen stand no more with looks and souls dejected. To woo and win despair; The joys ye mourn the Future hath collected, Your hopes are gathered there. âAnd as the dew which leaves the morning flowers Augments the after rain,â And as the blooms which fall from summer bowers Are multiplied again,â âSo shall the joys the Future holds in keeping Augment your after peace; So shall your hopes, which now are only sleeping, Return with large increase.â SOME THINGS LOVE ME. All within and all without me Feel a melancholy thrill; And the darkness hangs about me, Oh, how still! To my feet, the river glideth Through the shadow, sullen, dark; On the stream the white moon rideth, Like a barqueâ And the linden leans above me, Till I think some things there be In this dreary world that love me, Even me! Gentle buds are blooming near me, Shedding sweetest breath around; Countless voices rise, to cheer me, From the ground; And the lone bird comesâI hear it In the tall and windy pine Pour the sadness of its spirit Into mine; There it swings and sings above me, Till I think some things there be In this dreary world that love me, Even me! Now the moon hath floated to me, On the stream I see it sway, Swinging, boat-like, as 'twould woo me Far awayâ And the stars bend from the azure, I could reach them where I lie, And they whisper all the pleasure Of the sky. There they hang and smile above me, Till I think some things there be In the very heavens that love me, Even me! TO WORDSWORTH. Thy rise was as the morning, glorious, bright! And error vanished like the affrighted dark;â While many a soul, as the aspiring lark, Waked by thy dawn, soared singing to the light, Drowning in gladdest song the earth's despite! And beauty blossomed in all lowly nooksâ Love, like a river made of nameless brooks, Grew and exulted in thy wakening sight! All nature hailed thee as a risen sun; Nor will thy setting blur her thankful eyes! While earth remains thy day shall not be done, Nor cloud dispread to blot thy matchless skies! When Death's command, like Joshua's, shall arise, Thou'lt stand as stood the sun of Gibeon! PASSING THE ICEBERGS. A fearless shape of brave device, Our vessel drives through mist and rain, Between the floating fleets of iceâ The navies of the northern main. These arctic ventures, blindly hurled, The proofs of Nature's olden force,â Like fragments of a crystal world Long shattered from its skyey course,â These are the buccaneers that fright The middle sea with dream of wrecks, And freeze the south winds in their flight, And chain the Gulf-stream to their decks. At every dragon prow and helm There stands some Viking as of yore; Grim heroes from the boreal realm Where Odin rules the spectral shore. And oft beneath the sun or moon Their swift and eager falchions glowâ While, like a storm-vexed wind, the rune Comes chafing through some beard of snow. And when the far north flashes up With fires of mingled red and gold, They know that many a blazing cup Is brimming to the absent bold. Up signal there, and let us hail Yon looming phantom as we pass!â Note all her fashion, hull, and sail, Within the compass of your glass. See at her mast the steadfast glow Of that one star of Odin's throne; Up with our flag, and let us show The constellation on our own. And speak her well; for she might say, If from her heart the words could thaw, Great news from some far frozen bay, Or the remotest Esquimaux: Might tell of channels yet untold, That sweep the pole from sea to sea; Of lands which God designs to hold A mighty people yet to be:â Of wonders which alone prevail Where day and darkness dimly meet;â Of all which spreads the arctic sail; Of Franklin and his venturous fleet: How, haply, at some glorious goal His anchor holdsâhis sails are furled; That Fame has named him on her scroll, âColumbus of the Polar World.â Or how his ploughing barques wedge on Through splintering fields, with battered shares, Lit only by that spectral dawn, The mask that mocking darkness wears;â Or how, o'er embers black and few, The last of shivered masts and spars, He sits amid his frozen crew In council with the norland stars. No answerâbut the sullen flow Of ocean heaving long and vast;â An argosy of ice and snow, The voiceless North swings proudly past. CHRISTINE. Supposed to be related by a young sculptor on the hill-side between Florence and FiesolÃ©. Come, my friend, and in the silence and the shadow wrapt apart, I will loose the golden claspings of this sacred tomeâthe heart. By the bole of yonder cedar, under branches spread like eaves, We will sit where wavering sunshine weaves romance among the leaves. There by gentle airs of story shall our dreamy minds be swayed, And our spirits hang vibrating like the sunshine with the shade. Thou shalt sit, and, leaning o'er me, calmly look into my heart, Look as FiesolÃ© above us looketh on Val d'Arno's mart:â Shalt behold how Love's fair river down the golden city goes, As the silent stream of Arno through the streets of Florence flows. I was standing o'er the marble, in the twilight falling gray, All my hopes and all my courage waning from me like the day: There I leaned across the statue, heaving many a sigh and groan, For I deemed the world as heartless, ay, as heartless as the stone! Nay, I wellnigh thought the marble was a portion of my pain, For it seemed a frozen sorrow just without my burning brain. Then a cold and death-like stupor slowly crept along my frame, While my life seemed passing outward, like a pale reluctant flame. And my weary soul went from me, and it walked the world alone, O'er a wide and brazen desert, in a hot and brazen zone; There it walked and trailed its pinions, slowly trailed them in the sands, With its hopeless eyes fixed blindly, with its hopeless folded hands. And there came no morn,âno evening with its gentle stars and moon, But the sun amid the heavens made a broad, unbroken noon. And anon far reaching westward, with its weight of burning air, Lay an old and desolate ocean with a dead and glassy stare. There my spirit wandered, gazing for the goal no time might reach, With its weary feet unsandalled on the hard and heated beach. This it is to feel uncared for, like a useless wayside stone, This it is to walk in spirit through the desolate world alone! Still I leaned across the marble, and a hand was on my arm, And my soul came back unto me as 'twere summoned by a charm: While a voice in gentlest whisper, breathed my name into my ear, âAh! Andrea, why this silence, why this shadow and this tear?â Then I felt that I had wronged her, though I knew it not before; I had feared that she would scorn me if I told the love I bore. I had seen her, spoken to her, only twice or thrice perchance; And her mien was fine and stately, and all heaven was in her glance. She had praised my humble labors, the conception and the art,â She had said a thing of beauty nestled ever to her heart. And I thought one pleasant morning when our eyes together met, That her orbs in dewy splendor dropt beneath their fringe of jet. Though her form and air were noble, yet a simple dress she wore, Like yon maiden by the cypress, which the vines are weeping o'er. And she came all unattended,âher protection in her mien; And with somewhat of reluctance bade me call her name Christine. Then that name became a music, and my dreams went to the time, And my brain all day made verses, and her beauty filled the rhyme. Never dreamed I that she loved me, but I felt it now the more; For her hand was laid upon me, and her eyes were brimming o'er. Oh, she looked into my spirit, as the stars look in the stream. Or as azure eyes of angels calm the trouble of a dream. Then I told my love unto her, and her sighs came deep and longâ So yon peasant plays the measure, while the other leads the song. Then with tender words we parted, only as true lovers can; I for that deep love she bore me was a braver, better man. I had lived unloved of any, only loving Art before; Now I thought all things did love me, and I loved all things the more. I had lived accursed of Fortune, lived in penury worse than pain; But, when all the heaven was blackest, down it showered in golden rain. I was summoned to the palace, to the presence of the Duke, Feeling hopes arise within me that no grandeur could rebuke. Down he kindly came to meet me, but I thought the golden throne Upon which my love had raised me, was not lower than his own. Then he grasped my hand with fervor, and I gave as warm return, For I felt a noble nature in my very fingers burn. And I would not bow below him, if I could not rise above, For I felt within my bosom all the majesty of Love. âSir,â said he, âyour fame has reached me, and I fain would test your skillâ Carve me something, Signior; follow the free fancy of your will. âCarve me somethingâan Apollo, or a Dian with her hounds; Or Adonis, dying, watching the young life flow from his wounds;â âOr a dreamy-lidded Psyche, with her Cupid on her knee; Or a flying fretted Daphne, taking refuge in the tree. âBut I will not dictate, Signior; I can trust your taste and skillâ In the ancient armored chamber you may carve me what you will.â Then I thanked him as he left meâand I walked the armored hallâ Even I, so late neglected, walked within the palace wall. There were many suits of armor, some with battered breasts and casques; And I thought the ancestral phantoms smiled upon me from their masks. And my footsteps were elastic with an energy divine; Never in those breasts of iron beat a heart as proud as mine! There for days I walked the chamber with a spirit all inflamed, And I thought on all the subjects which the generous Duke had namedâ Thought of those, and thought of others, slowly thought them o'er and o'er, Till my stormy brain went throbbing like the surf along the shore. In despair I left the palace, sought my humble room again, And my gentle Christine met me, and she smiled away my pain. âCourage!â said she, and my courage leapt within me as she spake, And my soul was sworn to trial and to triumph for her sake. Who shall say that love is idle, or a weight upon the mind? Friend! the soul that dares to scorn it, hath in idle dust reclined. I returned, and in the chamber piled the shapeless Adam-earth; Piled it carelessly, not knowing to what form it might give birth. There I leaned, and dreamed, above it, till the day went down the west, And the darkness came unto me like an old familiar guest. But I started, for a rustle swept athwart the solemn gloom! And with light, like morn's horizon, gleamed the far end of the room! Then a heavy sea of curtain, in a tempest rolled away! Blessed Virgin! how I trembled! but it was not with dismay. And my eyes grew large and larger, as I looked with lips apart; And my senses drank in beauty, till it drowned my happy heart. There it stood, a living statue! with its loosened locks of brownâ In an attitude angelic, with the folded hands dropt down. But I could not see the features, for a veil was hanging there, Yet so thin, that o'er the forehead I could trace the shadowy hair. Then the veil became a trouble, and I wished that it were gone, And I spake, 'twas but a whisper, âLet thy features on me dawn!â And the heavy sea of drapery stormed again across my sight, Leaving me appalled with wonder, breathless in the sudden night. But for days, where'er I turned me, still that blessed form was there, As one looketh to the sunlight, then beholds it everywhere. And for days and days I labored, with a soul in courage mailed; And I wrought the nameless statue; but, alas! the face was veiled. I had tried all forms of featureâevery face of classic artâ Still the veil was thereâI felt itâin my brain, and in my heart! Sorrowing, I left the palace, and again I met Christine, And she trembled as I told her of the vision I had seen. And she sighed, âAh, dear Andrea,â while she clung unto my breast, âWhat if this should prove a phantom, something fearful and unblestâ âSomething which shall pass between us?â and she clasped me with her arm; âNay,â I answered, âlove, I'll test it with a most angelic charm. âLet me gaze upon thy features, love, and fear not for the rest; They shall exorcise the spirit if it be a thing unblest!â Then I hurried to the statue, where so often I had failed, And I made the face of Christine, and it stood no longer veiled! With a flush upon my forehead, then I called the Dukeâhe came, And in rustling silks beside him walked his tall and stately dame; And they looked upon the statueâthen on me with stern surprise; Then they looked upon each other with a wonder in their eyes! âWhat is this?â spake out the Duchess, with her gaze fixed on the Duke; âWhat is this?â and me he questioned in a tone of sharp rebuke. Like a miserable echo, I the question asked againâ And he said, âIt is our daughter! your presumption for your pain!â But asudden from the curtain, in her jewelled dress complete, Swept a maiden in her beauty, and she dropped before his feetâ And she cried, âO! fatherâmother, cast aside that frowning mien; And forgive my own Andrea, and forgive your child Christine! âO! forgive us: for, believe me, all the fault was mine alone!â And they granted her petition, and they blessed us as their own. THE FAIRER LAND. All the night, in broken slumber, I went down the world of dreams, Through a land of war and turmoil Swept by loud and laboring streams, Where the masters wandered, chanting Ponderous and tumultuous themes. Chanting from unwieldy volumes Iron maxims stern and stark, Truths that swept, and burst, and stumbled Through the ancient rifted dark; Till my soul was tossed and worried, Like a tempest-driven barque. But anon, within the distance, Stood the village vanes aflame, And the sunshine, filled with music, To my oriel casement came; While the birds sang pleasant valentines Against my window-frame. Then by sights and sounds invited, I went down to meet the morn, Saw the trailing mists roll inland Over rustling fields of corn, And from quiet hill-side hamlets Heard the distant rustic horn. There, through daisied dales and byways, Met I forms of fairer mould, Pouring songs for very pleasureâ Songs their hearts could not withholdâ Setting all the birds a-singing With their delicate harps of gold. Some went plucking little lily-bells, That withered in the hand; Some, where smiled a summer ocean, Gathered pebbles from the sand; Some, with prophet eyes uplifted, Walked unconscious of the land. Through that Fairer World I wandered Slowly, listening oft and long, And as one behind the reapers, Without any thought of wrong, Loitered, gleaming for my garner Flowery sheaves of sweetest song. ARISE. I. The shadow of the midnight hours Falls like a mantle round my form; And all the stars, like autumn flowers, Are banished by the whirling storm. The demon-clouds throughout the sky Are dancing in their strange delight, While winds unwearied play;âbut I Am weary of the night. Then rise, sweet maiden mine, arise, And dawn upon me with thine eyes. II. The linden, like a lover, stands And taps against thy window-pane; The willow with its slender hands Is harping on the silver rain. I've watched thy gleaming taper die, And hope departed with the lightâ The winds unwearied play;âbut I Am weary of the night. Then rise, sweet maiden mine, arise, And dawn upon me with thine eyes. III. The gentle morning comes apace, And smiling bids the night depart; Rise, maiden, with thy orient face, And smile the shadow from my heart! The clouds of night affrighted flyâ Yet darkness seals my longing sightâ All nature gladly singsâwhile I Am weary of the night. Then rise, sweet maiden mine, arise, And dawn upon me with thine eyes. THE MAID OF LINDEN LANE. Little maiden, you may laugh That you see me wear a staff, But your laughter is the chaff From the melancholy grain. Through the shadows long and cool You are tripping down to school; But your teacher's cloudy rule Only dulls the shining pool With its loud and stormy rain. There's a higher lore to learn Than his knowledge can discern, There's a valley deep and dern In a desolate domain; But for this he has no chartâ Shallow science, shallow art! Thitherâoh, be still, my heartâ One too many did depart From the halls of Linden Lane. I can teach you better things; For I know the secret springs Where the spirit wells and sings Till it overflows the brain. Come, when eve is closing in, When the spiders gray begin, Like philosophers, to spin Misty tissues, vain and thin, Through the shades of Linden Lane. While you sit as in a trance, Where the moon-made shadows dance, From the distaff of Romance I will spin a silken skein: Down the misty years gone by I will turn your azure eye; You shall see the changeful sky Falling dark or hanging high Over the halls of Linden Lane. Come, and sitting by the trees, Over long and level leas, Stretched between us and the seas, I can point the battle plain: If the air comes from the shore, We may hear the billows roar; But oh! never, never more Shall the wind come as of yore To the halls of Linden Lane. Those were weary days of woe, Ah! yes, many years ago, When a cruel foreign foe Sent his fleets across the main. Though all this is in your books, There are countless words and looks, Which, like flowers in hidden nooks, Or the melody of brooks, There's no volume can retain. Come, and if the night be fair, And the moon be in the air, I can tell you when and where Walked a tender loving twain: Though it cannot be, alas! Yet, as in a magic glass, We will sit and see them pass Through the long and rustling grass At the foot of Linden Lane. Yonder did they turn and go, Through the level lawn below, With a stately step and slow, And long shadows in their train: Weaving dreams no thoughts could mar, Down they wandered long and far, Gazing toward the horizon's bar, On their love's appointed star, Rising in the Lion's Mane. As across a summer sea, Love sailed o'er the quiet lea, Light as only love may be, Freighted with no care or pain. Such the night; but with the morn Brayed the distant bugle-hornâ Louder! louder it was borneâ Then were anxious faces worn In the halls of Linden Lane. With the trumpet's nearer bray, Flashing but a league away, Saw we arms and banners gay Stretching far along the plain. Neighing answer to the call, Burst our chargers from the stall; Mounted, here they leaped the wall, There the stream: while in the hall Eyes were dashed with sudden rain. Belted for the fiercest fight, And with swimming plume of white, Passed the lover out of sight With the hurrying hosts amain. Then the thunders of the gun On the shuddering breezes run, And the clouds o'erswept the sun, Till the heavens hung dark and dun Over the halls of Linden Lane. Few that joined the fiery fray Lived to tell how went the day; But that few could proudly say How the foe had fled the plain. Long the maiden's eyes did yearn For her cavalier's return; But she watched alone to learn That the valley deep and dern Was her desolate domain. Leave your books awhile apart; For they cannot teach the heart; Come, and I will show the chart Which shall make the mystery plain. I can tell you hidden things Which your knowledge never brings; For I know the secret springs Where the spirit wells and sings, Till it overflows the brain. Ah, yes, lightly sing and laughâ Half a child and woman half; But your laughter is the chaff From the melancholy grain; And, ere many years shall fly, Age will dim your laughing eye, And like me you'll totter by; For remember, love, that I Was the Maid of Linden Lane. THE SWISS STREET-SINGER. Throw up the glassy casement wide, And fling the heavy blinds aside, To let the sunshine and the tide Of music through the chamber glide. Oh, list! it is a maiden young, Who singeth in a foreign tongue; She poureth songs in strangest guise, In words translated by her eyes. Come, youth and childhood, form the ring, And, maidens, from the window lean, To bid the exile Switzer sing, And strike the trembling tambourine! The glistening azure in her eye Hath something of her native sky; The music of the rill and breeze Are mingled in her melodies; And in her form's tall graceful lines There's something of the mountain pines; And, oh, believe her soul may glow As purely as the Alpine snow. Come, youth and childhood, form the ring, And, maidens, from the window lean, To bid the exile Switzer sing, And strike the trembling tambourine! Oh, gaze not on her scornfully, For, gentle lady, like to thee, That wandering maiden well may be Acquaint with pain and misery,â And sad remembrance prompts the lay That telleth of the far away; While wildly in her music swell The glory, name, and land of Tell! Then, youth and childhood, form the ring, And, maidens, from the window lean, To bid the exile Switzer sing, And strike the trembling tambourine! A LEAF FROM THE PAST. INSCRIBED TO HENRY W. LONGFELLOW. With thee, dear friend, though far away, I walk, as on some vanished day, And all the past returns in beautiful array. With thee I still pace to and fro Along the airy portico, And gaze upon the flowers and river winding slow. And there, as in some fairy realm, I hear the sweet birds overwhelm The fainting air with music from the lofty elm, And hear the wingÃ©d winds, like bees, Go swarming in the tufted trees, Or dropping low away, o'erweighed with melodies. We walk beneath the cedar's eaves, Where statued Ceres, with her sheaves, Stands sheltered in a bower of trailing vines and leaves. Or strolling by the garden fence, Drinking delight with every sense, We watch th' encamping sun throw up his golden tents. With thee I wander as of old, When fall the linden's leaves of gold, Or when old winter whitely mantles all the wold. As when the low salt marsh was mown, With thee I idly saunter down Between the long white village and the towered town. I see the sultry bridge and long, The river where the barges throngâ The bridge and river made immortal in thy song. In dreams like these, of calm delight, I live again the wintry night, When all was dark without, but all within was brightâ When she, fit bride for such as thou, She with the quiet, queenly brow, Read from the minstrel's page with tuneful voice and low. Still in the crowd or quiet nook, I hear thy toneâbehold thy lookâ Thou speakest with thine eyes as from a poet's book. I listen to thy cheering word, And sadness, like the affrighted bird, Flies fast, and flies afar, until it is unheard. ROSALIE. A BALLAD. Full many dreamy summer days, Full many wakeful summer nights, Fair Rosalie had walked the ways Wherein young Love delights. Love took her by the willing handâ And oft she kissed the smiling boyâ He led her through his native land, The innocent fields of Joy. As oft the evening tryst was set, In cedarn grottoes far apart, That young and lovely maiden met The Minstrel of her heart. Then Time, like some celestial barque, With viewless sails and noiseless oars, Conveyed them through the starry dark Beyond the midnight shores. And once he sang enchanted words, In music fashioned to her choice, Until the many dreaming birds Learned beauty from his voice. He sang to her of charmÃ©d realms, Of streams and lakes discerned by chance, Of fleets, with golden prows and helms, Deep freighted with romance; Of vales, of purple mountains far, With flowers below and stars above, And of all homelier things that are Made beautiful by Love; Of rural days, when harvest sheaves Along the heated uplands glow, Or when the forest mourns its leaves And nests are full of snow. He sang how evil evermore Keeps ambush near our holiest ground, But how an angel guards the door Wherever Love is found. Even while he sang new flowers had bloomed, New stars looked through the river mist, And suddenly the moon illumed The temple of their tryst. And with those flowers he crowned her there, With vows which Time should not revoke; Then from the nearest bough his hair She bound with druid oak. Oh, moon and stars, oh, leaves and flowers, Ye heard their plighted accents thenâ And heard within those sacred bowers The tramp of armÃ©d men! Her father spake; his angry word The youth returned in keener heat; But when replied the old man's sword, The youth lay at his feet. And as a dreamer breathless, weak, From some immeasured turret thrown, For very terror cannot shriek, Fair Rosalie dropt down. They raised her in her drowning swoon, And placed her on a palfrey white; A statue, paler than the moon, They bore her through the night. Loud rang the many horses' hoofs, Like forging hammers, fast and full; To her they seemed to tread on woofs Of deep and noiseless wool. And like a fated bridal flower, From some betrothÃ©d bosom blown, They bore her to her prison tower, And left her there alone. And when the cool auroral air Had won her tangled dreams apart, She found the blossoms in her hairâ Their memory in her heart. She rose and paced the chamber dim, And watched the dying moon and stars, Until the sun's broad burning rim Blazed through the lattice bars. About her face the warm light stole, And yet her eyes no radiance won; For through the prison of her soul There streamed no morning sun. The day went by; and o'er the vale She saw the rising river mist; And like a bride subdued and pale, Arrayed her for the tryst, In nuptial robes, long wrought by stealth, With opals looped, pearl-broidered hems; And at her waist a cinctured wealth Of rare ancestral gems. The stars came out, and by degrees She heard a distant music swell, While through the intervening trees Sang the glad chapel bell. She heard her name, and knew the call: At once the noiseless door swung wide; She passed the shadowy stair and hallâ And One was at her side. One, whose dear voice had charmed her long, And wooed her spirit to delight, With airs of wild unwritten song, On many a summer night. They passed the village hand-in-hand; They gazed upon the minster towers, And heard behind a singing band Of maidens bearing flowers. Age blessed them as they gayly passed, And rosy children danced before, Until with trembling hearts at last They gained the chapel door. But music in its triumph brings New courage unto old and young; And with a rustle, as of wings, The choir arose and sung. And while the anthem, loud or low, Swung round them like a golden cloud, They walked the aisle, subdued and slow, And at the altar bowed. And sacred hands were o'er them spread, And blessings passed away in prayer, And then the soul of music sped Once more throughout the air. It swelled and dropped and waned and rose, With flights forever skyward given, Like birds whose pinions spread and close, And rise thereby to heaven. A murmur, like the soft desire Of leafy airs, went up the skies, And Rosalie beheld the choir On angel wings arise. Bright angels all encompassed her, An angel in the altar stood, And all her train of maidens were A wingÃ©d multitude. The chapel walls dissolved and swept Away, like mists when winds arise, For Rosalie that hour had kept Her tryst in Paradise. THE STRANGER ON THE SILL. Between broad fields of wheat and corn Is the lowly home where I was born; The peach-tree leans against the wall, And the woodbine wanders over all; There is the shaded doorway still, But a stranger's foot has crossed the sill. There is the barnâand, as of yore, I can smell the hay from the open door, And see the busy swallows' throng, And hear the peewee's mournful song; But the stranger comesâoh! painful proofâ His sheaves are piled to the heated roof. There is the orchardâthe very trees Where my childhood knew long hours of ease, And watched the shadowy moments run Till my life imbibed more shade than sun: The swing from the bough still sweeps the air, But the stranger's children are swinging there. There bubbles the shady spring below, With its bulrush brook where the hazels grow; 'Twas there I found the calamus root, And watched the minnows poise and shoot, And heard the robin lave his wing:â But the stranger's bucket is at the spring. Oh, ye who daily cross the sill, Step lightly, for I love it still; And when you crowd the old barn eaves, Then think what countless harvest sheaves Have passed within that scented door To gladden eyes that are no more. Deal kindly with these orchard trees; And when your children crowd your knees, Their sweetest fruit they shall impart, As if old memories stirred their heart: To youthful sport still leave the swing, And in sweet reverence hold the spring. ENDYMION. What time the stars first flocked into the blue Behind young Hesper, shepherd of the eve, Sleep bathed the fair boy's lids with charmÃ©d dew, 'Mid flowers that all day blossomed to receive Endymion. Lo! where he lay encircled in his dream; The moss was glad to pillow his soft hair, And toward him leaned the lily from the stream, The hanging vine waved wooing in the air Endymion. The brook that erewhile won its easy way, O'errun with meadow grasses long and cool, Now reeled into a fuller tide, and lay Caressing in its clear enamored pool Endymion. And all the sweet, delicious airs that fan Enchanted gardens in their hour of bloom, Blown through the soft invisible pipes of Pan, Breathed, 'mid their mingled music and perfume, Endymion. The silvery leaves that rustled in the light, Sent their winged shadows o'er his cheek entranced; The constellations wandered down the night, And whispered to the dew-drops where they danced, Endymion. Lo! there he slept, and all his flock at will Went star-like down the meadow's azure mist:â What wonder that pale Dian with a thrill Breathed on his lips her sudden love, and kissed Endymion! HAZEL DELL. From the early bells of morning, Till the evening chimes resound, In the busy world of labor, For my daily bread I'm bound, With no hopes of more possessions Than six scanty feet of ground! But my soul hath found an empire, Hid between two sister hills, Where she dreams or roams at pleasure, Finding whatsoe'er she wills; There sweet Hope her fairest promise With a lavish hand fulfils. And the path that windeth thither, There's no mortal foot may tread, For it leads to charmÃ©d valleys, With enchanted blossoms spread, Under groves of flowering poplars, Through the violets' purple bed. Overveiled with vines and water, Dropt from many a hidden well, Are the rocks which make the gateway; And the water's silver bell Keeps the warder, Silence, wakeful At the gate of Hazel Dell! Nor may any pass the warder Till the watchword they repeat; They must go arrayed like angels, In their purity complete; And the stave-supported pilgrim Lay the sandals from his feet! And within the purple valley, Where perpetual summer teems, Whisper silken-tonguÃ©d runnels, Melting into larger streams, Winding round through sun and shadow, Like a gentle maiden's dreams. Then let labor hold me vassal, Since my soul can scorn his reign! Even fetters for the body Were but bands of sand, and vain, While the spirit thus can wander, Singing through its own domain! In the long still hours of darkness, Stretched from weary chime to chime, Thus beside my own Castalie I can gather flowers of rhyme, And with all their fresh dew freighted, Fling them on the stream of time! A GLIMPSE OF LOVE. She came as comes the summer wind, A gust of beauty to my heart; Then swept away, but left behind Emotions which shall not depart. Unheralded she came and went, Like music in the silent night; Which, when the burthened air is spent, Bequeaths to memory its delight; Or, like the sudden April bow That spans the violet-waking rain: She bade those blessed flowers to grow Which may not fall or fade again. Far sweeter than all things most sweet, And fairer than all things most fair, She came and passed with footsteps fleet, A shining wonder in the air. LINES TO A BLIND GIRL. Blind as the song of birds, Feeling its way into the heart,â Or as a thought ere it hath words,â As blind thou art:â Or as a little stream A dainty hand might guide apart, Or Loveâyoung Love's delicious dream,â As blind thou art:â Or as a slender barque, Where summer's varying breezes startâ Or blossoms blowing in the dark,â As blind thou art:â Or as the Hope, Desire Leads from the bosom's crowded mart, Deluded Hope, that soon must tire,â As blind thou art:â The chrysalis that folds The wings that shall in light depart, Is not more blind than that which holds The wings within thy heart. For when thy soul was given Unto the earth, a beauteous trust, To guard its matchless glory, Heaven Endungeoned it in dust. ONCE MORE INTO THE OPEN AIR. Once more into the open air, Once more beneath the summer skies, To fields and woods and waters fair, I come for all which toil denies. I loiter down through sun and shade, And where the waving pastures bloom, And near the mowers' swinging blade Inhale the clover's sweet perfume. The brook which late hath drank its fill, Outsings the merry birds above; The river past the neighboring hill Flows like a quiet dream of love. Yon rider in the harvest plain, The master of these woods and fields, Knows not how largely his domain To me its richest fulness yields. He garners what he reaps and mows, But there is that he cannot take, The love which Nature's smile bestows, The peace which she alone can make. LOVE'S GALLERY. PICTURE FIRST. MIRIAM. Fair Miriam's was an ancient manse Upon the open plain: It looked to ocean's dim expanse, Saw miles of meadow pasture dance Beside the breezy main. A porch, with woodbines overgrown, Faced eastward to the shore; While autumn's sun, through foliage brown, 'Twixt leaf and lattice flickered down To tessellate the floor. There walked fair Miriam;âas she stept, A rustle thrilled the air; Rare, starry gems her tresses kept, While o'er her brow a crescent swept The darkness of her hair. But she too oft had paced the hall To ponder chronicles which Time Had given at many an intervalâ Ancestral shadows on the wall Looking their pride sublime. And she too well had learned their look, And wore upon her tender age A haughtiness I could not brookâ I said, It is a glorious book, But dared not trust the page. PICTURE SECOND. BERTHA. Mild Bertha's was a home withdrawn Beyond the city's din; Tall Lombard trees hemmed all the lawn, And up the long straight walks a dawn Of blossoms shone within. Along the pebble paths the maid Walked with the early hours, With careful hands the vines arrayed, And plucked the small intruding blade From formal plots of flowers. A statued Dian to the air Bequeathed its mellow light; She called the flying figure fair, The forward eyes and backward hair, And praised the marble's white. Her pulses coursed their quiet ways, From heart to brain controlled; She read and praised in studied phrase The bards whom it were sin to praise In measured words and cold. I love the broad bright world of snow, And every strange device Which makes the woods a frozen show, The rivers hard and stillâbut, oh, Ne'er loved a heart of ice. PICTURE THIRD. MELANIE. Within a dusky grove, where wound Great centenarian vines, Binding the shadows to the ground, The dark-eyed Melanie was found Walking between the pines. A sudden night of hair was thrown About her shining neck; All woes she buried in her ownâ Her sea of sadness carried down All lighter thoughts to wreck. The past was hers; the coming years No golden promise brought:â She gazed upon the midnight spheres To read her future; and the tears Sprang vassals to her thought. She heard all night through her domain The river moan below; The whippoorwill and owlet's strain Filled up the measure of her pain In streams of fancied woe. Thus as the mournful Melanie Swept through my waking dream, I said, Oh soul, still wander free, It is not written thou shalt see Thy image in this stream. PICTURE FOURTH. AURELIA. Where flamed a field of flowersâand where Sang noisy birds and brooksâ Aurelia to the frolic air Shook down her wanton waves of hair, With laughter-loving looks. Her large and lustrous eyes of blue, Dashed with the dew of mirth, Bequeathed to all their brilliant hue; She saw no shades, nor even knew She walked the heavy earth. Her ringing laughter woke the dells When fell the autumn blight:â She sang through all the rainy spellsâ For her the snow was full of bells Of music and delight. She swept on her bewildering way, By every pleasure kissed,â Making a mirth of night and day; A brook all sparkle and all spray, Dancing itself to mist. I love all bright and happy things, And joys which are not brief; All sights and sounds whence pleasure springs; But weary of the harp whose strings Are never tuned to grief. PICTURE FIFTH. AMY. Round Amy's home were pleasant treesâ A quiet summer space Of garden flowers and toiling bees; Below the yellow harvest leas Waved welcome to the place. And Amy she was very fair, With eyes nor dark nor blue; And in her wavy chestnut hair Were braided blossoms, wild and rare, Still shimmering with the dew. Her pride was the unconscious guise Which to the pure is given: Her gentle prudence broke to sighs, And smiles were native to her eyes, As are the stars to heaven. Here, love, said I, thy rest shall be, Oh, weary, world-worn soul! Long tossed upon this shifting sea, Behold, at last the shore for thee Displays the shining goal. Dear Amy, lean above me now, And smooth aside my hair, And bless me with thy tender vow, And kiss all memories from my brow, Till thou alone art there. THE MINERS. Burrow, burrow, like the mole, Ye who shape the columned caves! Ye are black with clinging coal, Black as fiery Afric's slaves! Sink the shadowy shaft afar Deep into our native star! Rend her iron ribs apart, Where her hidden treasures are, Nestled near her burning heart! Dig, nor think how forests grow Above your headsâhow waters flow Responsive to the song of birdsâ How blossoms paint in silent words What hearts may feel but cannot know! Dig ye, where no day is seen; Vassals in the train of Night, Build the chambers for your Queen, Where with starless locks she lies, Robbed of all her bright disguise! There no precious dews alight, None but what the cavern weeps, Down its scarred and dusky face! There's no bird in all the place; Not a simple flower ye mark, Not a shrub or vine that creeps Through the long, long Lapland dark! Burrow, burrow, like the mole, Dark of face, but bright of soul! Labor is not mean or low! Ye achieve, with every blow, Something higher than ye know! Though your sight may not extend Through your labors to the end, Every honest stroke ye give, Every peril that ye brave In the dark and dangerous cave, In some future good shall live! THE WINNOWER. Sings a maiden by a river, Sings and sighs alternately; In my heart shall flow forever, Like a stream, her melody. In her hair of flaxen hue Tend'rest buds and blossoms gleam; And her beauty glows as through Hazy splendors of a dream. Like her melody's rich barsâ Or a golden flood of stars,â Rustling like a summer rain, Through her fingers falls the grain, Swells her voice in such sweet measure, I must join for very pleasure; But my lay shall be of her, Bright and lovely Winnower! When her song to laughter merges, Melts the music of her tongue, Like a streamlet's silver surges Over golden pebbles flung. From her hands the grainless chaff On the light winds dances free; But a sigh will check her laugh.â âSo much worthlessness, ah me, Mingles with the good!â saith she. Yet the grain is fair to see. Laughter, like some sweet surprise, Lights again her dewy eyes, And her song hath drowned her sighs; Therefore will I sing of her, Bright and lovely Winnower! Down beside as fair a river Sings the Maiden Poesy; In my heart shall flow forever Her undying melody. Through her rosy fingers fall Golden grains of richest thought; While the grainless chaff is all By the scattering breezes caught:â âSo much worthlessness, ah me, Mingles with the good!â saith she. Yet the grain is bright to see. Therefore laughs she merrily! Laughs and sings in such sweet measure, I must join for very pleasureâ While my heart keeps time with her, I will praise the Winnower! FRAGMENTS FROM THE REALM OF DREAMS. âThe baseless fabric of a vision.â Oft have I wandered through the Realm of Dreams, By shadowy mountains and clear running streams, Catching at times strange transitory gleams Of Eden vistas, glimmering through a haze Of floral splendor, where the birds, ablaze With color, streaked the air, like flying stars, With momentary bars; And heard low music breathe above, around, As if the air within itself made sound,â As if the soul of Melody were pent Within some unseen instrument Hung in a viewless tower of air, And with enchanted pipes beguiled its own despair. But stranger than all other dreams which led, Asleep or waking, my adventurous tread, Were these which came of late to me Through fields of slumber, and did seem to be Wrapped in an awful robe of prophecy. I walked the woods of March, and through the boughs The earliest bird was calling to his spouse; And in the sheltered nooks Lay spots of snow, Or with a noiseless flow Stole down into the brooks; And where the spring-time sun had longest shone The violet looked up and found itself alone. Anon I came unto a noisy river, And felt the bridge beneath me sway and quiver; Below, the hungry waters howled and hissed, And upward blew a blinding cloud of mist; But there the friendly Iris built its arch, And I in safety took my onward march. Now coming to a mighty hill, Along the shelvy pathway of a rill Which danced itself to foam and spray, I clomb my steady way. It may be that the music of the brook Gave me new strengthâit may be that I took Fresh vigor from the mountain air Which cooled my cheek and fanned my hair; Or was it that adown the breeze Came sounds of wondrous melodies,â Strange sounds as of a maiden's voice Making her mountain home rejoice? Following that sweet strain, I mounted still And gained the highest hemlocks of the hill, Old guardians of a little lake, which sent Adown the brook its crystal merriment, Blessing the valley where the planter went Sowing the furrowed mould and whistling his content. Through underwood of laurel, and across A little lawn shoe-deep with sweetest moss, I passed, and found the lake, which, like a shield Some giant long had ceased to wield, Lay with its edges sunk in sand and stone, With ancient roots and grasses overgrown; But far more beautiful and rare Than any strange device that e'er Glittered upon the azure field Of ancient warrior's polished shield, Was the fair vision which did lie Embossed upon the burnished lake, And in its sweet repose did make A second self that sang to the inverted sky. Not she who lay on banks of thornless flowers Ere stole the serpent into Eden's bowers; Not she who rose from Neptune's deep abodes, The wonder of Olympian Gods; Nor all the fabled nymphs of wood or stream Which blest the Arcadian's dream, Could with that floating form compare, Lying with her golden harp and hair Bright as a cloud in the sunset air. Her tresses gleamed with many stars, And on her forehead one, like Mars, A lovely crown of light dispread Around her shining head. And now she touched her harp and sung Strange songs in a forgotten tongue; And as my spirit heard, it seemed To feel what it had lived or dreamed In other worlds beyond our skies,â In ancient spheres of Paradise; And as I gazed upon her face, It seemed that I could dimly trace Dear lineaments long lost of yore Upon some unremembered shore, Beyond an old and infinite sea, In the realm of an unknown century. For very joy I clapped my hands, And leaped upon the nearer sands!â A moment, and the maiden glanced Upon me where I stood entranced; Then noiselessly as moonshine falls Adown the ocean's crystal walls, And with no stir or wave attended, Slowly through the lake descended; Till from her hidden form below The waters took a golden glow, As if the star which made her forehead bright Had burst and filled the lake with light! Long standing there I watched in vain,â The vision would not rise again. Again, in sleep, I walked by singing streams, And it was May-day in my Realm of Dreams:â The flowering pastures and the trees Were full of noisy birds and bees; And, swinging roses, like sweet censers, went The village children making merriment, Followed by older people;âas they passed One beckoned, and I joined the last. We crossed the meadow, crossed the brook, And through the scented woodland took Our happy way, until we found An open space of vernal ground; And there around the flowery pole I joined the joyous throng and sang with all my soul! But when the little ones had crowned their queen, And danced their mazes to the wooded scene To hunt the honeysuckles, and carouse Under the spice-wood boughs,â I turned, and saw with wondering eye A maiden in a bower near by Wreathed with unknown blossoms, such as bloom In orient isles with wonderful perfume. And she was very beautiful and bright; And in her face was much of that strange light Which on the mountain lake had blessed my sight: Her speech was like the echo of that song Which on the hill-side made me strong. Now with a wreath, now with a coin she played, Pursuing a most marvellous tradeâ Buying the lives of young and old, Some with Fame, and some with gold! And there with trembling steps I came, But ere I asked for gold or fame, Or ere I could announce my name, The wreath fell withered from her head, And from her face the mask was shed; Her mantle droppedâand lo! the morning sun Looked on me through a nameless skeleton! Again I stood within the Realm of Dreams, At midnight, on a huge and shadowy tower; And from the east the full moon shed her beams, And from the sky a wild meteoric shower Startled the darkness; and the night Was full of ominous voices and strange light, Like to a madman's brain;âbelow, Prophetic tongues proclaiming woe Echoed the sullen roar Of Ocean on the neighboring shore; And in the west a forest caught the sound, And bore it to its utmost bound. And then, for hours, all stood as to behold Some great event by mighty seers foretold; And all the while the moon above the sea Grew strangely large and red,âand suddenly, Followed by a myriad stars, Swung at one sweep into the western sky, And, widening with a melancholy roar, Broke to a hundred flaming bars, Grating the heavens as with a dungeon door. Then to that burning gate A radiant spirit came, and through the grate Smiled till I knew the Angel, Fate! And in its hand a golden key it bore To open that celestial door. Sure, I beheld that angel thrice; Twice met on earth, it mocked me twice; But now behind those bars it beamed Such love as I had never dreamed, Smiling my prisoned soul to peace With eyes that promised quick release; And looks thus spake to looks, where lips on earth were dumb: âBehold, behold, the hour is come!â âCOME, GENTLE TREMBLER.â Come, gentle trembler, comeâfor, see, Our hearts have lost their native fires; The vacant world invites us,âwe Must go the heirless heirs of countless sires. Let us away, the wild wolf's home Were not so desolate as ours; Beside the singing brooks we'll roam, And seek a sweet community of flowers. Here are the dwellings whence the few We loved, departed; where they lead We followâthese their tombs;âbut who Shall write our epitaphs, and who shall read? Hark, how the light winds flow and ebb Along the open halls forlorn! See how the spider's dusty web Floats at the casement, tenantless and torn! The old, old Sea, as one in tears, Comes murmuring with its foamy lips, And, knocking at the vacant piers, Calls for its long-lost multitude of ships. Against the stone-ribbed wharf, one hull Throbs to its ruin like a breaking heart: Oh, come, my breast and brain are full Of sad responseâLet Silence keep the mart! THE FROZEN GOBLET. The night was dark, the winds were loud, The storm hung low in a swinging cloud; The blaze on my chamber lamp was dim. And athwart my brain began to swim Those visions that only swim and sweep Under the wavering wings of Sleep:â And suddenly into my presence came A Spectre, thin as that dismal flame That burns and beams, a moving lamp, Where the dreary fogs of night encamp. Her lips were pale, her cheeks were white, Her eyes were full of phantom light. Once, twice, thrice, A goblet wrought to a rare device She held to fevered lips of mine; But mocked them with its frozen wine, Till they were numb on the dusky ice. I could not speak, I could not stir, I could do nought but look at her; Nought but look in her wonderful eyes, And lose me in their mysteries. The goblet shone, the goblet glowed, But from its rim no liquid flowed. Its sides were bright with pictures rare Of demons foul and angels fair, And Life and Death o'er Youth contending, And Love on luminous wings descending, Celestial cities with golden domes, And caverns full of laboring gnomes. Once, twice, thrice, That goblet wrought to a rare device She held to fevered lips of mine, But mocked them with its frozen wine, Till they were numb on the dusky ice. Loud rang the bell through the stormy air, And the clock replied on the shadowy stair, And Chanticleer awoke and flung The echo from its silvery tongue. All nature with a sudden noise Proclaimed the momentary poise Of that invisible beam, that weighs At midnight the divided days. The Phantom beckoned and turned away, I had no power to speak or stay:â We passed the dusky corridor, Her sandal gems illumed the floor, And with a ruddy, phosphor light, The frozen goblet lit the night. Once, twice, thrice, That goblet wrought to a rare device She held to fevered lips of mine, But mocked them with its frozen wine. Till they were numb on the dusky ice. She led me through enchanted woods, Through deep and haunted solitudes, By threatening cataracts, and the edges Of high and dizzy mountain ledges, And over bleak and perilous ridges, To frail and air-suspended bridges, Where, in the muffled dark beneath, Invisible rivers talked of death, Until, for very sympathy With the unfathomed mystery, I cried, âHere I resign my breath, Here let me taste the cup of Death!â Once, twice, thrice, That goblet wrought to a rare device She held again to lips of mine, But mocked them with its frozen wine, Till they were numb on the dusky ice. And then a voice within me said, âWouldst thou journey to the dead?â Shed this mantle, and pass forever Into the black, eternal river?â For very sympathy, depart From the tumult of this heart? Know'st thou not that mightier river, Rolling on in darkness ever, Ever sweeping, coiling, boiling, Howling, fretting, wailing, toiling, Where every wave that breaks on shore Is a human heart that can bear no more?â Once, twice, thrice, That goblet wrought to a rare device She held to fevered lips of mine, But mocked them with the frozen wine, Till they were numb on the dusky ice. And then in sorrow and shame I cried. âOh, take me to that river's side, And I will shun the languid shore, And plunge me into the dark uproar, And drink of the waters till they impart A generous sense, and a human heart.â And all at once, around me rose A mingled mutiny of woes, And my soul discerned these sounds to be The wail of a wide humanity; Till my bosom heaved responsive sighs, And tremulous tears were in my eyes. Once, twice, thrice, That goblet wrought to a rare device She held to fevered lips of mine, And at their instant touch, the wine Flowed freely from the dusky ice. I drank new life, I could not stop, But drained it to its latest drop, Till the Phantom with the goblet rare Dissolved into the shadowy airâ Dissolved into the outer gloom, And once more I was in my room; Yet oft before my waking eyes The figures of that goblet riseâ The angels and the fiends at strife, And Youth 'twixt warring Death and Lifeâ The domesâthe gnomesâmysterious things! And Love descending on bright wings. Once, twice, thrice, That goblet wrought to a rare device Fair Memory holds to lips of mine, And bathes them with the sacred wine, The tribute of that dusky ice. THE CITY OF THE HEART. The heart is a city teeming with lifeâ Through all its gay avenues, rife With gladness And innocent madness, Bright beings are passing along, Too fleeting and fair for the eye to behold, While something of Paradise sweetens their song, They are gliding away with their wild gushing ditty, Out of the city, Out of the beautiful gates of gold! Through gates that are ringing While to and fro swinging, Swinging and ringing ceaselessly, Like delicate hands that are clapped in glee, Beautiful hands of infancy! The heart is a cityâand gay are the feet That dance along To the joyous beat Of the timbrel that giveth a pulse to song. Bright creatures enwreathed With flowers and mirth, Fair maidens bequeathed With the glory of earth, Sweep through the long street, and singing await, A moment await at the wonderful gate; Every second of time there comes to depart Some form that no more shall revisit the heart! They are gliding away and breathing farewellâ How swiftly they pass Through the gates of brass, Through gates that are ringing While to and fro swinging, And making deep sounds, like the half-stifled swell Of the far-away ring of a gay marriage bell! The heart is a city with splendor bedight, Where tread martial armies arrayed for the fight, Under banner-hung arches, To war-kindling marches, To the fife and the rattle Of drums, with gay colors unfurled, On, eager for battle, To smite their bright spears on the spears of the world! Through noontime, through midnight, list, and thou'lt hear The gates swing in front, then clang in the rear. Like a bright river flowing, The war host is going, And like to that river, Returning, ah, never! Through daylight and darkness low thunder is heard From the city that flings Her iron-wrought wings, Flapping the air like the wings of a bird! The heart is a cityâhow sadly and slow, To and fro, Covered with rust, the solemn gates go! With meek folded palms, With heads bending lowly, Strange beings pass slowly Through the dull avenues, chanting their psalms; Sighing and mourning, they follow the dead Out of the gates that fall heavy as leadâ Passing, how sadly, with echoless tread, The last one is fled! No more to be opened, the gates softly close, And shut in a stranger who loves the repose; With no sigh for the past, with no countenance of pity, He spreads his black flag o'er the desolate city! THE BEGGAR OF NAPLES. The music of the marriage bell Woke all the morning air to pleasure, And breasts there were that rose and fell To the delightful measure. Oh, well it were if they might hear alway The music of their nuptial day Flowing, as o'er enchanted lakes and streams Out of the land of dreamsâ Sweet sounds that melt but never cease, Dropped from celestial bells of peace. Oh, well it were if those rare bridal flowers Had drunken deep of life's perpetual dews, Had drunken of those charmÃ©d showers Forever falling in ambrosial hues Through the far loving skies, Beyond the flaming walls of long-lost Paradise; Or grown beside that fabled river Where it is spring-time ever; Where, when the aged pilgrim stooped and drank, He rose again upon that primrose bank In all the bloom of youth to bloom forever. Ah, well for Beauty's transient bowers If they might bud and blow in life's autumnal hours:â For she who wore that bridal wreath Was Naples' noblest child; The fairest maid that e'er beguiled An Abbot of a prayerful breath. And he who rode beside her there Was Fame and Fortune's richest heir; One who had come from foreign realms afar To dazzle like a new-discovered star. Yet as they passed between the crowd He looked not scornfully nor proud, But to the beggars thronging every side Scattered the golden coin in plenteous rain, And smiled to see their joy insane. And, passing, thus addressed the bride:â âThe merry bells make music sweet, But never to the beggar's ear Fell music half so sweet and clear As the chime of gold when it strikes the street; It drives their hearts to swifter swinging, And fills their brains with gladder ringing Than ever bells will swing or ring, Even though the sturdy sacristan Should labor the very best he can To chime for the wedding of a king. Such sights to me will always bring The story of a beggar, who Perchance has ofttimes begged of you; And here the tale may well be told, To while away this idle gait That keeps us from our happy fate: For Time is very lame and old Whene'er the surly graybeard brings A prayed-for pleasure on his wings; But robbing us of a joy can flee As fleet of foot as Mercury. âAvoiding every wintry shade, The lazzaroni crawled to sunny spots,â At every corner miserable knots Pursued their miserable trade, And held the sunshine in their asking palms, Which gave unthanked its glowing alms, Thawing the blood until it ran As wine within a vintage runs. And there was one among that begging clan, One of Italia's listless dreamy sons, A native Neapolitanâ A boy whose cheeks had drawn their olive tan From fifteen summer suns. Long had he stood with naked feet Upon the lava of the street, With shadowy eyes cast down, Making neither a smile nor frown, And in the crowd he stood alone, Alone with empty hanging hands, And through his brain the idle dreams Slid down like idle sands, Or hung like mists o'er sleeping streams In uninhabitable lands. To him, I ween, the same, All seasons went and came; Nor did ambition's pomp and show Disturb his fancy's tranquil flow; For, like the blossom of the soil, Existence was his only toil. âOne morn (the bells had summoned all to mass) He knelt before the old cathedral doorâ At such a place the wealthier who pass Will throw a pious pittance to the poor, Who kneel with face demure, With their mute eyes and hands saying their alas!â Oh, beautiful it was to see him there, Looking his wordless prayer, With solemn head depressed, And hands laid crosswise on his breast,â Such figures saw Murillo in his dream, The painter and the pride of Spain; With such he made his living canvas gleam, As canvas touched by man may never gleam again. âUpon the beggar's heart the matin hymn Fell faint and dim, As when upon some margin of the sea The fisher breathes the briny air, And hears the far waves' symphony, But hears it unaware. The music from the lofty aisle, And all the splendor of the sacred pile,â The pictures hung at intervals Like windows, giving from the walls Clear glimpses of the days agone, From that blest hour when over Bethlehem shone The shepherds' Star, until that darker time When groaned the earth aloud with agony sublime: All were unheeded, And came, but as his breath; Or if there came a thought, that thought unheeded Even in its birth met death. The names of Raphael,âAngelo,âLorraine,â Da Vinci,âRosa,âTitian,âand the rest, Are sounds to thrill the Italian's soul and brain With all the impulse native to his breast; And Dante,âPetrarch,âthese are mighty names The meanest tongue with a true pride proclaims; And Ariosto's song a loved bequest; And Tasso's sung by allâby all is loved and blest. But what cared he, the sunburnt beggar boy? All these bequeathed no other joy Than did the silent stars, Or morn or evening with their golden bars, Or the great azure arch of day, Or his own bright, unrivalled bay, Or old Vesuvius' deathless flamesâ And these to him alone were empty sights and names. âFew were there who did any alms bestow, For few will hear accustomed sounds of woe; Yet there was one among that few Who but a moment stopped, And in the beggar's hands the silver dropped, And shed the benediction of her smile. Such smile as hers might well renew A heart to its lost light, and might beguile The shadow of a mourner's hour; Such smiles are like the blessed dew By evening shed upon a wayside flower, Sinking to the heart of hearts with a miraculous power. The earliest primrose of the spring, Which at the brook-side suddenly in sight Gleams like a water sprite; And the first herald bird on southern wing, Chanting his wild, enthusiastic rhyme About the summer-timeâ Wake in the soul an instant, deep delight! But there are eyes whose first sweet look Outshines the primrose by the brook; And there are lips whose simplest words Outrival even the spring-time birds. Ah, well, I ween, the beggar felt their power, And wore them in his heart from that bright hour. She passedâa maiden very young and fair, Of an illustrious house the pride and heir; She passedâbut ah, she left The miserable boy bereft!â Bereft of all that quiet which had lain Like a low mist within his brain,â The idle fogs of some rank weedy isle Hanging on the breezeless atmosphere, Over a miasmatic mere;â All this beauty of her smile Had blown into a storm that would not rest again. At once upstarting from his knees, He watched her as she went; The blood awakened from its slothful ease, Through all his frame a flaming flood was sent. He stood as with a statue's fixed surprise, Great wonder making marble in his eyes! She, like a morn, had dawned upon his soul; And now he saw the marvellous whole Of that mysterious land, And felt a sense of awe, as they who stand For the first time upon an alien strand,â Some sailor of a foreign sea, Who, from the smooth waves swinging lazily, Is thrown upon a shore Where life is full of noise and strife for evermore. He stood awake; and suddenly there burst The music of the organ on his brain, And into every sense athirst Dispensed a welcome rain. Now that his soul had passed from its eclipse, All things at once became a glorious show; Now could he see the sainted pictures glow; And instantly unto his lips Rolled fragments of old songâ Fragments which had been thrown Into his heart unknown, And buried there had lain in silence deep and long. âHe saw his fellows kneel where he had knelt With tattered garb and supplicating air; And for the first time in his life he felt How mean was his attire, and that his feet were bare. He sighed, and bit his lips, and passed away; And from that day His fellows idly as before, Without a hope, without a care, Stood clustered in the sunny air, But there the beggar boy was seen no more. âHis childhood, like a dry and sandy bar, Lay all behind him as he hurled His soul's hot barque to sea, and wide unfurled The straining sail upon a billowy world. And now he joined the sacred fleet afar, And 'mid tempestuous waves of war Defied the Saracen and Death, And won the warrior's laurel wreath, And gave his beggar name to Fame's industrious breath. âYears came and went, and no one missed the boy, Nor wept his long farewell; They little guessed how much their joy Was of his deeds to tell. And when he knew his native town Had learned to talk of his renown, The youth a bearded man returned; And more than for renown he yearned To see that blessed smile again Which erst made beauty in his brain, And ever in the van of war Had shone a most propitious star. He came, and she of whom he long had dreamed With hopes which nought could e'er destroy, In brighter beauty on him beamed, And blessed him with a deeper joy; Even she, the noblest lady of the land, Bestowed on him her virgin hand! Ah, sure it was the fairest alms That ever blessed a beggar's palms! âTo him the chime which filled the skies Upon his nuptial morn, When down the loving breezes borne, Did seem to be by angels rung From silver bells of Paradise, In golden turrets hung. And she, who woke the boy to man, As little dreamed, I guess, as now, My gentle lady, as dost thou, How proud she was to wed that barefoot Neapolitan.â THE BRICKMAKER. I. Let the blinded horse go round Till the yellow clay be ground, And no weary arms be folded Till the mass to brick be moulded. In no stately structures skilled, What the temple we would build? Now the massive kiln is risenâ Call it palaceâcall it prison; View it well: from end to end Narrow corridors extend,â Long, and dark, and smothered aisles:â Choke its earthly vaults with piles Of the resinous yellow pine; Now thrust in the fettered fireâ Hearken! how he stamps with ire, Treading out the pitchy wine; Wrought anon to wilder spells, Hear him shout his loud alarms; See him thrust his glowing arms Through the windows of his cells. But his chains at last shall sever; Slavery lives not forever; And the thickest prison wall Into ruin yet must fall; Whatsoever falls away Springeth up again, they say; Then, when this shall break asunder, And the fire be freed from under, Tell us what imperial thing From the ruin shall upspring? There shall grow a stately building, Airy dome and columned walls; Mottoes writ in richest gilding Blazing through its pillared halls. In those chambers, stern and dreaded, They, the mighty ones, shall stand; There shall sit the hoary-headed Old defenders of the land. There shall mighty words be spoken, Which shall thrill a wondering world; Then shall ancient bonds be broken, And new banners be unfurled. But anon those glorious uses In these chambers shall lie dead, And the world's antique abuses, Hydra-headed, rise instead. But this wrong not long shall lingerâ The old capitol must fall; For, behold! the fiery finger Flames along the fated wall! II. Let the blinded horse go round Till the yellow clay be ground, And no weary arms be folded Till the mass to brick be mouldedâ Till the heavy walls be risen, And the fire is in his prison: But when break the walls asunder, And the fire is freed from under, Say again what stately thing From the ruin shall upspring? There shall grow a church whose steeple To the heaven shall aspire; And shall come the mighty people To the music of the choir. On the infant, robed in whiteness, Shall baptismal waters fall, While the child's angelic brightness Sheds a halo over all. There shall stand enwreathed in marriage Forms that trembleâhearts that thrill; To the door Death's sable carriage Shall bring forms and hearts grown still! Decked in garments richly glistening, Rustling wealth shall walk the aisle; And the poor without stand listening, Praying in their hearts the while. There the veteran shall come weekly With his cane, oppressed and poor, 'Mid the horses standing meekly, Gazing through the open door. But these wrongs not long shall lingerâ The presumptuous pile must fall; For, behold! the fiery finger Flames along the fated wall! III. Let the blinded horse go round Till the yellow clay be ground, And no weary arms be folded Till the mass to brick be mouldedâ Say again what stately thing From the ruin shall upspring? Not the hall with columned chambers, Starred with words of liberty, Where the freedom-canting members Feel no impulse of the free; Not the pile where souls in error Hear the words, âGo, sin no more!â But a dusky thing of terror, With its cells and grated door. To its inmates each to-morrow Shall bring in no tide of joy. Born in darkness and in sorrow, There shall stand the fated boy. With a grief too loud to smother, With a throbbing, burning headâ There shall groan some desperate mother, Nor deny the stolen bread! There the veteran, a poor debtor, Marked with honorable scars, Listening to some clanking fetter, Shall gaze idly through the bars: Shall gaze idly, not demurring, Though with thick oppression bowed; While the many, doubly erring, Shall walk honored through the crowd. Yet these wrongs not long shall lingerâ The benighted pile must fall; For, behold! the fiery finger Flames along the fated wall! IV. Let the blinded horse go round Till the yellow clay be ground, And no weary arms be folded Till the mass to brick be mouldedâ Till the heavy walls be risen And the fire is in his prison. Capitol, and church, and jail, Like our kiln at last shall fail; Every shape of earth shall fade; But the Heavenly Temple made For the sorely tried and pure, With its Builder shall endure! SONG FOR A SABBATH MORNING. Arise, ye nations, with rejoicing rise, And tell your gladness to the listening skies; Come out, forgetful of the week's turmoil, From halls of mirth and iron gates of toil; Come forth, come forth, and let your joy increase Till one loud pÃ¦an hails the day of peace. Sing, trembling age, ye youths and maidens sing; Ring, ye sweet chimes, from every belfry ring; Pour the grand anthem till it soars and swells, And heaven seems full of great aerial bells! Behold the Morn from orient chambers glide, With shining footsteps, like a radiant bride; The gladdened brooks proclaim her on the hills, And every grove with choral welcome thrills. Rise, ye sweet maidens, strew her path with flowers, With sacred lilies from your virgin bowers; Go, youths, and meet her with your olive boughs; Go, age, and greet her with your holiest vows;â See where she comes, her hands upon her breast, The sainted Sabbath comes, and smiles the world to rest. THE NAMELESS. Come fill, my merry friends, to-night, And let the winds unheeded blow, And we will wake the deep delight Which true hearts only know. And ere the passing wine be done, Come drink to those most fair and dear, And I will pledge a cup to one Who shall be nameless here. Come fill, nor let the flagon stand, Till pleasure's voice shall drown the wind, Nor heed old Winter's stormy hand Which shakes the window-blind. And down the midnight hour shall run The brightest moments of the year; While I will fill, my friends, to one Who shall be nameless here. Pledge you to lips that smile in sleep, Whose dreams have strewed your path with flowers, And to those sacred eyes that weep Whene'er your fortune lowers; And charm the night, ere it be done, With names that are forever dear, While I must pour and quaff to one Who shall be nameless here. To her I proudly poured the first Inspiring beaker of the Rhine, And still it floods my veins as erst It filled the German vine. And when her memory, like the sun, Shall widen down my dying year, My latest cup will be to one Who shall be nameless here. INDIAN SUMMER. It is the season when the light of dreams Around the year in golden glory lies;â The heavens are full of floating mysteries, And down the lake the veilÃ©d splendor beams! Like hidden poets lie the hazy streams, Mantled with mysteries of their own romance, While scarce a breath disturbs their drowsy trance. The yellow leaf which down the soft air gleams, Glides, wavers, falls, and skims the unruffled lake. Here the frail maples and the faithful firs By twisted vines are wed. The russet brake Skirts the low pool; and starred with open burrs The chestnut standsâBut when the north wind stirs, How, like an armÃ©d host, the summoned scene shall wake! A MORNING, BUT NO SUN. The morning comes, but brings no sun; The sky with storm is overrun; And here I sit in my room alone, And feel, as I hear the tempest moan, Like one who hath lost the last and best, The dearest dweller from his breast! For every pleasant sight and sound, The sorrows of the sky have drowned; The bell within the neighboring tower Falls blurred and distant through the shower; Look where I will, hear what I may, All, all the world seems far away! The dreary shutters creak and swing, The windy willows sway and fling A double portion of the rain Over the weeping window-pane. But I, with gusty sorrow swayed, Sit hidden here, like one afraid, And would not on another throw One drop of all this weight of woe! TO THE MASTER BARDS. Ye mighty masters of the song sublime, Who, phantom-like, with large unwavering eyes, Stalk down the solemn wilderness of Time, Reading the mysteries of the future skies; Oh, scorn not earth because it is not heaven; Nor shake the dust against us from your feet, Because we have rejected what was given! Still let your tongues the wondrous theme repeat! Though ye be friendless in this solitude, Quick-wingÃ©d thoughts, from many an unborn year, God-sent, shall feed ye with prophetic food, Like those blest birds which fed the ancient Seer! And Inspiration, like a wheelÃ©d flame, Shall bear ye upward to eternal fame! âOH, WHEREFORE SIGH?â Oh, wherefore sigh for what is gone, Or deem the future all a night? From darkness through the rosy dawn The stars go singing into light. And to the pilgrim lone and gray, One thought shall come to cheer his breast;â The evening sun but fades away To find new morning in the west. THE WAY. A weary, wandering soul am I, O'erburthened with an earthly weight; A pilgrim through the world and sky, Toward the Celestial Gate. Tell me, ye sweet and sinless flowers, Who all night gaze upon the skies, Have ye not in the silent hours Seen aught of Paradise? Ye birds, that soar and sing, elate With joy, that makes your voices strong, Have ye not at the golden gate Caught somewhat of your song? Ye waters, sparkling in the morn, Ye seas, which glass the starry night, Have ye not from the imperial bourn Caught glimpses of its light? Ye hermit oaks, and sentinel pines, Ye mountain forests, old and gray, In all your long and winding lines, Have ye not seen the way? O moon, among thy starry bowers, Know'st thou the path the angels tread? Seest thou beyond thy azure towers The shining gates dispread? Ye holy spheres, that sang with earth, When earth was still a sinless star, Have the immortals heavenly birth Within your realms afar? And thou, O sun! whose light unfurls Bright banners through unnumbered skies, Seest thou among thy subject worlds The radiant portals rise? All, all are mute! and still am I O'erburthened with an earthly weight; A pilgrim through the world and sky, Toward the Celestial Gate. No answer wheresoe'er I roamâ From skies afar no guiding ray; But, hark! the voice of Christ says, âCome! Arise! I am the way!â THE GREAT ARE FALLING FROM US. The great are falling from usâto the dust Our flag droops midway full of many sighs; A nation's glory and a people's trust Lie in the ample pall where Webster lies. The great are falling from usâone by one As fall the patriarchs of the forest-trees, The winds shall seek them vainly, and the sun Gaze on each vacant space for centuries. Lo, Carolina mourns her steadfast pine Which towered sublimely o'er the Southern realm, And Ashland hears no more the voice divine From out the branches of its stately elm:â And Marshfield's giant oak, whose stormy brow Oft turned the ocean tempest from the West, Lies on the shore he guarded longâand now Our startled eagle knows not where to rest! THE DEPARTURE. All around me glows the harvest As I drop below the town, And the pleasant song of workmen On the breeze is floating down. Far away the slender brooklet Gleams upon the yellow plain, Like a newly sharpened sickle Dropped amid the golden grain. By the town and through the valleys Sweeps the flashing river fast, Like a herald to the future With a summons from the past. Now my soul hath caught the music Of the happy harvest strain, And the stream of gladness flashes, Like the brooklet, in my brain. And, responsive to the river, How my spirit sweeps along, As it goes to meet the future With a purpose firm and strong! A PSALM FOR THE SORROWING. Gray wanderer in a homeless world, Poor pilgrim to a dusty bier; On Time's great cycle darkly hurled From year to year: See in the sky these words unfurled: âThy home is here!â Pale mourner, whose quick tears reveal Thy weight of sorrow but begun: Not long thy burdened soul shall reel Beneath the sun; A few swift circles of the wheel, And all is done. Though galled with fetters ye have lain, To vulture hopes and fears a prey; Oh, moan not o'er your ceaseless pain Or slow decay; For know, the soul thus files its chain And breaks away. NIGHT. Oh Night, most beautiful and rare! Thou giv'st the heavens their holiest hue, And through the azure fields of air Bring'st down the gentle dew. Most glorious occupant of heaven, And fairest of the earth and sea, The wonders of the sky are given, Imperial Night, to thee! For thou, with angel music blest, Didst stand in that dim age afar, And hold upon thy trembling breast Messiah's herald star! In Olivet thou heard'st Him pray, And wept thy dews in softer light, And kissed his sacred tears away, Thrice blessed, loving Night! And thou didst overweigh with sleep The watchers at the sepulchre; And heard'st the asking Mary weep Till Jesus answered her. For this I love thy hallowed reign; For more than this thrice blest thou art; Thou gain'st the unbeliever's brain By entering at the heart! Oh Night, whose loving smile divine Thus lifts the spirit from the dust, God's best and brightest gifts are thineâ All thine, and it is just. WINTER. Sad soulâdear heart, O why repine? The melancholy tale is plainâ The leaves of spring, the summer flowers Have bloomed and died again. The sweet and silver-sandalled Dew, Which like a maiden fed the flowers, Hath waned into the beldame Frost, And walked amid our bowers. Some buds there wereâsad hearts, be still!â Which looked awhile unto the sky, Then breathed but once or twice, to tell How sweetest things may die! And some must blight where many bloom;â But, blight or bloom, the fruit must fall! Why sigh for spring or summer flowers, Since Winter gathers all? He gathers allâbut chide him notâ He wraps them in his mantle cold, And folds them close, as best he can, For he is blind and old. Sad soulâdear heart, no more repineâ The tale is beautiful and plain: Surely as Winter taketh all, The Spring shall bring again. THE BARDS. When the sweet day in silence hath departed, And twilight comes with dewy, downcast eyes, The glowing spirits of the mighty-hearted Like stars around me rise. Spirits whose voices pour an endless measure, Exhaustless as the choral founts of night, Until my trembling soul, oppressed with pleasure, Throbs in a flood of light. Old Homer's song in mighty undulations Comes surging ceaseless up the oblivious main:â I hear the rivers from succeeding nations Go answering down again. Hear Virgil's strain through pleasant pastures strolling, And Tasso's sweeping round through Palestine, And Dante's deep and solemn river rolling Through groves of midnight pine. I hear the iron Norseman's numbers ringing Through frozen Norway like a herald's horn; And like a lark, hear glorious Chaucer singing Away in England's morn. In Rhenish halls, still hear the pilgrim lover Chant his wild story to the wailing strings, Till the young maiden's eyes are brimming over Like the full cup she brings. And here from Scottish hills the souls unquiet Pouring in torrents their perpetual lays, As their impetuous mountain runnels riot In the long rainy days; The world-wide Shakspeareâthe imperial Spenser: Whose shafts of song o'ertop the angels' seats,â While, delicate as from a silver censer, Float the sweet dreams of Keats! Nor these aloneâfor through the growing present, Westward the starry path of Poesy liesâ Her glorious spirit, like the evening crescent, Comes rounding up the skies. THE DISTANT MART. The day is shut:âNovember's night On Newark's long and rolling height Falls suddenly and soon;â At once the myriad stars disclose; And in the east a glory glows Like that the red horizon shows Above the moon. But on the western mountain tops The moon, in new-born beauty, drops Her pale and slender ring; Still, like a phantom rising red O'er haunted valleys of the dead, I see the distant east dispread Its fiery wing. I know by thoughts, which, like the skies, Grow darker as they slowly rise Above my burning heart, It is the light the peasant views, Through nightly falling frost and dews, While Fancy paints in brighter hues The distant mart. Through shadowy hills and meadows brown The calm Passaic reaches down Where the broad waters lie;â From hill-side homes what visions teem! The fruitless hopeâambitious dreamâ Go freighted downward with the stream, And yonder die! And youths and maids with strange desires O'er quiet homes and village spires Behold the radiance grow; They see the lighted casements fineâ The crowded halls of splendor shineâ The gleaming jewels and the wineâ But not the woe! Take from yon flaunting flame the ray Which glows on heads untimely gray, On blasted heart and brain,â From rooms of death the watcher's lamp, From homes of toil, from hovels damp, And dens where Shame and Crime encamp With Want and Pain: From vain bazaars and gilded halls, Where every misnamed pleasure palls, Remove the chandeliers; Then mark the scanty, scattered rays, And think amid that dwindled blaze How few shall walk their happy ways And shed no tears! But now, when fade the fevered gleams, Some trouble melts away to dreams, Some pain to sweet repose:â And as the midnight shadows sweep, Life's noisy torrent drops to sleep, Its unseen current dark and deep In silence flows. THE TWINS. From a beautiful lake on the mountain Two rivulets came down, Prattling awhile to the violets, 'Mid shadows green and brown. Over beds of golden lustre, Around by rock and tree, They sang the same tune with their silvery tongues, And clapped their hands in glee. Over rocks with mosses mantled, They eddied and whirled, like a waltzing pair, Till, hand in hand, with laughter and leap They mingled their misty hair. Over the self-same ledges, Singing the self-same tune, They passed from April to breezy May, Toward the fields of June. They whirled, and danced, and dallied, And through the meadows slid, Till under the same thick grass and flowers Their further course was hid! I saw two beautiful children Of one fair mother born, Playing among the dewy buds That bloomed beneath the morn. The same in age and beauty, The same in voice and size, The same bright hair upon their necks, The same shade in their eyes. Singing the same song ever In the self-same silvery tune, They passed from April into May, Toward the fields of June. They whirled, and danced, and dallied The beautiful vales amid, Till under the same thick leaves and flowers Their future course was hid. LINES WRITTEN IN FLORENCE. Within this far Etruscan clime, By vine-clad slopes and olive plains, And round these walls still left by Time, The bound'ries of his old domains:â Here at the dreamer's golden goal, Whose dome o'er winding Arno drops, Where old Romance still breathes its soul Through Poesy's enchanted stops:â Where Art still holds her ancient state (What though her banner now is furled), And keeps within her guarded gate The household treasures of the world:â What joy amid all this to find One single bird, or flower, or leaf, Earth's any simplest show designed For pleasure, what though frail or briefâ If but that leaf, or bird, or flower, Were wafted from the western strand, To breathe into one happy hour The freshness of my native land! That joy is mineâthe bird I hear, The flower is blooming near me now, The leaf that some great bard might wear In triumph on his sacred brow. For, lady, while thy voice and face Make thee the Tuscan's loveliest guest, Within this old romantic space Breathes all the freshness of the West. A NIGHT AT THE BLACK SIGN. Ye, who follow to the measure Where the trump of Fortune leads, And at inns aglow with pleasure Rein your golden-harnessed steeds, In your hours of lordly leisure Have ye heard a voice of woe On the starless wind of midnight Come and go? Pilgrim brothers, whose existence Rides the higher roads of Time, Hark, how from the troubled distance, Voices made by woe sublime, In their sorrow, claim assistance, Though it come from friend or foeâ Shall they ask and find no answer? Rise and go. One there was, who in his sadness Laid his staff and mantle down, Where the demons laughed to madness What the night-winds could not drownâ Never came a voice of gladness Though the cups should foam and flow, And the pilgrim thus proclaiming Rose to go. âAll the night I hear the speaking Of low voices round my bed, And the dreary floor a-creaking Under feet of stealthy tread:â Like a very demon shrieking Swings the black sign to and froâ Come, arise, thou cheerless keeper, For I go. âOn the hearth the brands are lying In a black, unseemly show; Through the roof the winds are sighing, And they will not cease to blow; Through the house sad hearts replying Send their answer deep and lowâ Come, arise, thou cheerless keeper, For I go. âTell me not of fires relighted And of chambers glowing warm, Or of travellers benighted, Overtaken by the storm. Urge me not; your hand is blighted As your heart isâeven so! Come, arise, thou cheerless keeper, For I go. âTell me not of goblets teeming With the antidote of pain, For its taste and pleasant seeming Only hide the deadly bane; Hear your sleepers tortured dreaming, How they curse thee in their woe! Come, arise, thou cheerless keeper, For I go. âI will leave your dreary tavern Ere I drink its mandragore: Like a black and hated cavern, There are reptiles on the floor; They have overrun your tavern, They are at your wine below! Come, arise, thou fearful keeper, For I go. âThere's an hostler in your stable Tends a steed no man may own, And against your windy gable How the night-birds scream and moan! Even the bread upon your table Is the ashy food of woe; Come, arise, thou fearful keeper, For I go. âHere I will not seek for slumber, And I will not taste your wine: All your house the fiends encumber, And they are no mates of mine; Never more I join your number Though the tempests rain or snowâ Here's my staff and here's my mantle, And I go.â Suffering brothersâdoubly brothersâ (Pain hath made us more akin) Trust not to the strenth of others, Trust the arm of strength within; One good hour of courage smothers All the ills an age can know; Take your staff and take your mantle, Rise and go. A DESERTED FARM. The elms were old, and gnarled, and bentâ The fields, untilled, were choked with weeds, Where every year the thistles sent Wider and wider their wingÃ©d seeds. Farther and farther the nettle and dock Went colonizing o'er the plain, Growing each season a plenteous stock Of burrs to protect their wild domain. The last who ever had ploughed the soil Now in the furrowed churchyard layâ The boy who whistled to lighten his toil Was a sexton somewhere far away. Instead, you saw how the rabbit and mole Burrowed and furrowed with never a fear; How the tunnelling fox looked out of his hole, Like one who notes if the skies are clear. No mower was there to startle the birds With the noisy whet of his reeking scythe; The quail, like a cow-boy calling his herds, Whistled to tell that his heart was blithe. Now all was bequeathed with pious careâ The groves and fields fenced round with briersâ To the birds that sing in the cloisters of air, And the squirrels, those merry woodland friars. LINES TO A BIRD WHICH SUNG AT MY WINDOW ONE MORNING IN LONDON. Whence comest thou, oh wandering soul of song? Round the celestial gates hast thou been winging, And hearkening to the angels all night long To brighten earth with somewhat of their singing? Thou child of sunshine, spirit of the flowers! Nature, through thee, with loving tongue rejoices, Until these walls dissolve themselves to bowers, And all the air is full of woodland voices. The winds that slumbered in the fields of dew, Float round me now with music on their pinions, Such as I heard while yet my years were few, By native streams, in boyhood's lost dominions. And with the breath of morning on my brow, I hear the accents of the few who love me; Sing on, full heart! I am no exile nowâ This is no foreign sky that smiles above me. I hear the happy sounds of household glee, The heart's own music, floating here to bless me, And little ones who smiled upon my knee Now clap the dimpled hands that would caress me. Oh! music sweeter than the sweetest chime Of magic bells by fairies set a-swinging; I am no pilgrim in a foreign clime, With these blest visions ever round me clinging. I hear a voice no melody can reach; Dear lips, speak on in your accustomed measure, And teach my heart what you so well can teach, How only love is earth's enduring pleasure. Oh! music sweeter than the Arcadian's tune, Wooing the dryads from the woodlands haunted; Or than beneath the mellow harvest-moon Trembles at midnight over lakes enchanted! Oh! sweeter than the herald of the morn, The clarion lark, that wakes the drowsy peasant, Is this which thrills my breast, so else forlorn, And with the Past and distant fills the Present. Thus, with the music ringing in my heart, I may awhile forget an exile's sorrow, And, armed with courage, riseâand so depart; But what sweet bird shall sing to me to-morrow? THE SCULPTOR'S LAST HOUR. All in their lifetime carve their own soul's statue. The middle chimes of night were dead;â The sculptor pressed his sleepless bed, With locks grown gray in a world of sin; His eyes were sunken, his cheeks were thin; And, like a leaf on a withering limb, The fluttering life still clung to him. While gazing on the shadowy wall, He heard the muffled knocker fall:â Before an answering foot could stir, Entered the midnight messenger: Around his shining shoulders rolled Long and gleaming locks of gold; The radiance of his features fell In Beauty's light unspeakable, And like the matin song of birds, Swelled the rich music of his words. âArise! it is your monarch's will; Ere sounds from the imperial hill The warder's trumpet-blast, His palace portal must be passed: Arise! and be the veil withdrawn, And let the long-wrought statue dawn! The stars that fill the fields of light Must pale before its purer light; The unblemished faceâthe spotless limb, Must shine among the seraphim: Faultless in formâin nothing dimâ It must be ere it come to Him!â The sculptor rose with heavy heart, And slowly put the veil apart, And stood with downcast look, entranced, The while the messenger advanced, And thought he heard, yet knew not why, His hopes like boding birds go by, And felt his heart sink ceaselessly Down, like the friendless dead at sea. O! for one breath to stir the air, To break the stillness of despair; Welcome alike, though it were given From sulphurous shade, or vales of heaven! Now on the darkness swelled a sigh!â The sculptor raised his languid eye, And saw the radiant stranger stand Hiding his sorrow with his hand; His heart a billowy motion kept, And ever, with its fall and rise, The stillness of the air was swept With a long wave of sighs. The old man's anxious asking eyes Grew larger with their blank surprise, With wonder why he wept:â And while his eyes and wonder grew, Came, with the tears which gushed anew, The music of the stranger's tongue, But broken, like a swollen rill That heaves adown its native hill, Sobbing where late it sung:â âIs this the statue fair and white A long laborious life hath wrought, And which our generous Prince hath bought? Is this (so soulless, soiled, and dull) To pass the golden gates of light And stand among the beautiful? The lines which seam the front and cheek Too well unholy lusts bespeak; The brow by Anger's hand is weighed, And Malice there his scar hath made; There Scorn hath set her seal secure, And curled the lip against the poor; And Hate hath fixed the steady glance Which Jealousy hath turned askance; While thoughts, of those dark parents born Innumerable, from night till morn, And morn till night, have wrought their will, Like stones upon a barren hill. Old man! although thy locks be gray, And life's last hour is on its wayâ Although thy limbs with palsy quake, Thy hands, like windy branches, shakeâ Ere from yon rampart high and round The watchful warder's blast shall sound, Let this be alteredâstill it may,â Your Monarch brooks no more delay!â The stranger spake and passed away. A moment stood the aged man With lips apart, and looks aghast, Still gazing where the stranger passed. And now a shudder o'er him ran, As chill November's breezes sweep Across the dying meadow grass; His tongue was dry, he could not speak, His eyes were glazed like heated glass. But when the tears began to creep Adown the channels of his cheek, A long and shadowy train, Born of his sorrowing brain, With shining feet, and noiseless tread, By dewy-eyed Repentance led, Around the statue pressed: With eager hand and swelling breast, Hope, jubilant, the chisel seized And heavenward turned the eye; Forgiveness, radiant and pleased, The ridges of the brow released While with a tear and sigh Sweet Charity the scorn effaced; And Mercy, mild and fair, Upon the lips her chisel placed, And left her signet there: And Love, the earliest-born of Heaven, Over the features glowing, ran; While Peace, the best and latest given, Finished what Hope began. One minute now before the last, The stately stranger came; A smile upon the statue castâ Then to the fainting stranger passed, And spake his errand and his name; And on the old man's latest breath Swelled the sweet whisper, âWelcome, Death!â Afar from the imperial height Sounded the warder's horn: Upward, by singing angels borne, The statue passed the gates of light, Outshining all the stars of night, And fairer than the morn. THE SCULPTOR'S FUNERAL. Through the darkened streets of Florence, Moving toward thy church, Saint Lorenz, Marched the bearers, masked and singing, With their ghostly flambeaux flinging Ghostlier shadows, that went winging Round the portals and the porches, As if spirits, which had hovered In the darkness undiscovered, Danced about the hissing torches, Like the moths that whirl and caper Drunken round an evening taper. Unconsoled and unconsoling Rolled the Arno, louder rolling As the rain pouredâand the tolling Though the thick shower fell demurely, Fell from out one turret only, Where the bell swung sad and lonely Prisoned in the cloud securely. Masked in black, with voices solemn, Strode the melancholy column, With a stiff and soulless burden, Bearing to the grave its guerdon, While the torch flames, vexed and taunted By the night winds, leapt and flaunted, 'Mid the funeral rains that slanted, Those brave bearers marched and chanted, Through the darkness thick and dreary, With a woful voice and weary, MISERERE. Light to light, and dark to dark, Kindred natures thus agree; Where the soul soars none can mark, But the world below may harkâ Miserere, Domine! Dew to dew, and rain to rain, Swell the streams and reach the sea; When the drouth shall burn the plain, Then the sands shall but remainâ Miserere, Domine! Flame to flameâlet ashes fall Where the fireless ashes be; Embers black and funeral Unto dying cinders callâ Miserere, Domine! Life to life, and dust to dust! Christ, who died upon the tree, Thine the promise, ours the trust, We are weakâbut thou art justâ Miserere, Domine! FIRST BY-STANDER. There, stand aside, the very eaves are weeping As are the heavens in sympathy with us:â Italia's air hath not within its keeping A nobler heart than that which lies there sleeping, For whom the elements are wailing thus. SECOND BY-STANDER. I reverenced himâhe was a marvellous schemer; Hath built more airy structures in his day Than ever wild and opiate-breathing dreamer Hath drugged his dreams with even in Cathay. His fancy went in marble round the earth And whitened it with statuesâwhere he trod The silent people leapt to sudden birth. And all the sky, exulting high and broad, Became a mighty Pantheon for God. THIRD BY-STANDER. You reverenced him? I loved him, with a scope Of feeling I may never know again; And love him still, even though beyond all hope The priest, the bishop, cardinal, and pope, Should banish him to wear a burning chain In those great dungeons of the unforgiven, Under the space-deep castle walls of heaven. I know the Church considered it a sin, I know the Duke considered it a shameâ That our Alzoni would not stoop to win What any blunderer, nowaday, may claim, A niche in Santa Croce,âwhich hath been, And is, to them, the very shrine of Fame! Why, look you, why should one carve out his soul In bits to meet the world's unthankful stare; For Ignorance to hold in his control And sly-eyed Jealousy's detracting glare? To see the golden glories of his brain Outglittered by a brazen counterfeit? The starriest spirit only shines in vain, When every rocket can outdazzle it! CHORUS OF STUDENTS, FOLLOWING. They bear the great Alzoniâhe is dead,â Our hope is dead, and lies on yonder bier; There is no comfort left for any here Since he is dead. Oh, mother Florence, droop your queenly head, And mingle ashes with your wreath of flowersâ Build funeral altars in your ducal bowers; For he is dead. Oh, sacred Arno, be your ripples shed No more in music o'er your silver sands, But mourn to death, and wring your watery hands; For he is dead. Ye dusky palaces, whose gloom is wed To princely names that never may depart, Drown all your lights in tearsâthe prince of Art, Your hope, is dead! Ye spirits who to glory have been led, In years agone, departed souls of might, Make joyful space in heaven, for our delight On earth is dead. And thus with melancholy songs they bore him Into the chapelâ'twixt the columns vast They set the bier, and lit great tapers o'er him, And looked their last. They looked and pondered on his dreamy history Whose sudden close had left them broken-hearted, Till cloudy censers veiled the light in mystery, And they departed. DOOMED AND FORGOTTEN. Two mighty angels in the outer blue, With great palm-branches slanting in their hands, Stood by the golden gate that guards the view Wherein God's temple stands. So still they were, the porphyry pillars high That propt the fretted cornice and the frieze, Stood not more breathless when the choral sky Withheld its symphonies. And golden halos bound their brows in light, Till each head shone like Saturn with his rings, And to their sandals, beautiful and bright Went down their crosswise wings. Low at their feet, with pinions all distraught, As they the Siroc's stormy path had swept, And ashen cheeks still hot with burning thought, A spirit sat and wept:â And shed such tears as from the heart can flow Alone when Hope flies far from our distress, Leaving no guide athwart the world of woe, The pathless wilderness. Thus have I seen some sad and sightless one, Before a palace with nor hound nor staff, Sit weeping in the sultry dust, with none To speak in his behalf. But happier far that prisoner from the day, With all the sunlight mocking his blank eyes, Than him, whose doomÃ©d path forgotten lay Along the under skies. Doomed and forgotten! These are sounds attuned To all the world conceives of miseryâ And drown the heart, as if the last wave swooned Above us in the sea! Doomed and forgottenâby our God forgot, Who noteth even the sparrow in his fall; With whom the smallest living thing is not For His great care too small. Doomed and forgottenâat the angels' feet He sat with dull and weary wings deprest,â But now, where once the song of peace was sweet, There came no voice of rest. There was a time, while yet his cheek's soft glow Bloomed in the boyhood of his earthly years, He had a vision, which no man may know, That drowned his eyes with tears. Some God-sent angel, wavering down the sky, Had sought him when the world was most apart, And given this vision to his dreaming eye, And stamped it on his heart. Then he withdrew from all his fellow youths, His heaven-touched soul with inspiration filled, And said, âMy time is God's; the cause is Truth's; Beneath their dome I build!â For days and nights he walked the solemn wood, Rounding to fullest form his great intent, And viewless phantoms all about him stood, And followed where he went. If he despaired, the pine-cone in his way Fell from the limb that sentinels the windâ The small spring whispered courage where it lay In ancient rocks enshrined. The wintry mountain stood with glory topt, And Iris bound the laboring torrent's brow, The acorn, full of future summers, dropt From out the stormy bough. The flowery vines in Nature's unseen hand Curled into wreaths, as if Fame wandered there,â The laurel, leaning o'er the pathway, fanned The brightness of his hair. There was a time!âoh, sad and bitter breath That sighs o'er loss of days, no more to beâ Of actions dropt to dreamsâand dreams to death, And thenâEternity! There crouched the spirit, abject and forlorn, Upon the azure highway, like a blot, And raised its low voice, for they needs must mourn, The doomed and the forgot. But soon, abashed to hear his own âalas!â He took his way aslant the nether spaceâ And, wheresoe'er a star beheld him pass, It turned and veiled its face! Oh soul, remember, howe'er small the scope Of thought, or action, that around thee lies, It is the finished task alone can ope The gates of Paradise. SONG OF THE ALPINE GUIDE. On Zurich's spires, with rosy light, The mountains smile at morn and eve, And Zurich's waters, blue and bright, The glories of those hills receive. And there my sister trims her sail, That like a wayward swallow flies; But I would rather meet the gale That fans the eagle in the skies. She sings in Zurich's chapel choir, Where rolls the organ on the air, And bells proclaim, from spire to spire, Their universal call to prayer. But let me hear the mountain rills, And old St. Bernard's storm-bell toll, And, 'mid these great cathedral hills, The thundering avalanches roll. My brother wears a martial plume, And serves within a distant land,â The flowers that on his bosom bloom Are placed there by a stranger hand. Love meets him but in foreign eyes, And greets him in a foreign speech:â But she who to my heart replies Must speak the tongue these mountains teach. The warrior's trumpet o'er him swells, The triumph which it only hath; But let me hear the mule-worn bells Speak peace in every mountain path. His spear is ever 'gainst a foe, Where waves the hostile flag abroad;â My pike-staff only cleaves the snow, My banner the blue sky of God. On Zurich's side my mother sits, And to her whirring spindle singsâ Through Zurich's wave my father's nets Sweep daily with their filmy wings To that beloved voice I list And view that father's toil with pride; But, like a low and vale-born mist, My spirit climbs the mountain side. And I would ever hear the stir And turmoil of the singing winds, Whose viewless wheels around me whir, Whose distaffs are the swaying pines. And, on some snowy mountain head, The deepest joy to me is given, When, net-like, the great storm is spread To sweep the azure lake of heaven. Then, since the vale delights me not, And Zurich wooes in vain below, And it hath been my joy and lot To scale these Alpine crags of snowâ And since in life I loved them well, Let me in death lie down with them, And let the pines and tempests swell Around me their great requiem. MORNING IN MARTIGNY. 'Tis sunrise on Saint Bernard's snow, 'Tis dawn within the vale below; And in Martigny's streets appear The mule and noisy muleteer; And tinklings fill the rosy air, Until the mountain pass seems there, Up whose steep pathway scarcely stirs The long, slow line of travellers; And in the shadowy town is heard The sound of many a foreign word. Old men are there, whose locks are white As yonder cloud which veils the height; And maidens, whose young cheeks are kissed By ringlets flashing bright or dark, Whose hearts are light as yonder mist That holds the music of the larkâ And youths are there with jest and laugh, Each bearing his oft-branded staff To chronicle, when all is done, The dangerous heights his feet have won. So toils through life the pilgrim soul 'Mid rocky ways and valleys fair; At every base or glorious goal, His staff receives the record thereâ The names that shall forever twine, And blossom like a fragrant vineâ Or, like a serpent, round it cling Eternally to coil and sting. A MAIDEN'S TEARS. O, when a maiden's soul is stirred To pity's deepest, last excess, And, like some lonely, brooding bird, Folds its bright wings in mournfulness; And pours its sympathy in sighs, That sweeten on the rosy lips; And sends the tears into the eyes, To flood them with a half eclipse,â How brighter its veiled beauty shows Than all the light which joy bestows! Thus fairer the fair flower appears, Beneath a dewy fulness bowed; The moon a double lustre wears, Within the halo of a cloud. The music of a maiden's mirth May be the sweetest sound to earth; But tears, in love and pity given, Are welcomer, by far, to Heaven. WOMAN. An angel wandering out of heaven, And all too bright for Eden even, Once through the paths of paradise Made luminous the auroral air; And, walking in His awful guise, Met the Eternal Father there; Who, when He saw the truant sprite, Smiled love through all those bowers of light. While deep within his trancÃ©d spell, Our Eden sire lay slumbering near, God saw, and said, âIt is not well For man alone to linger here.â Then took that angel by the hand, And with a kiss its brow He prest, And whispering all His mild command, He laid it on the sleeper's breast; With earth enough to make it human, He chained its wings, and called it WOMAN. And if perchance some stains of rust Upon her pinions yet remain, 'Tis but the mark of God's own dust, The earth-mould of that Eden chain! THE CITY OF GOD. âHeaven lies about us in our infancy.ââ Wordsworth. Ere the rose and the roseate hues of the dawn, With the dews of my youth, were all scattered and gone; Ere the cloud, like the far-reaching wing of the night, Had shut out the glory of God from my sight, I saw a wide realm in the azure unfold, Where the fields nodded towards me their flowers of gold; And the soft airs sailed o'er them, and dropt from above, As if shed from innumerous pinions of love: There were trees with broad boles steeped in perfume and dew, While their full breasts forever leaned up to the blueâ And within their wide bosoms the winds seemed to rest With the calm like the sleep of a soul that is blest; Or, if any light rustle stole out from their limbs, 'Twas the murmurous music of delicate hymnsâ As if some dear angel sat singing within To a spirit just won from the regions of sin: There were streams which seemed born but in slumberous bowers, Stealing down, like a dream, through the sleep of the flowersâ So pure was the azure they won from the height, The blue hills seemed melting to rivers of light; And within this fair realm, where but angels have trod, I beheld, as I thought, the great City of God! All its high walls were pierced with no engines of Deathâ No moat, with its dull pool, lay stagnant beneath: The last bolts, I ween, the stout heart has to fear, Are pointed and sped from Death's citadel here; And the last hungry moat the pure soul has to brave, Ere it passes the portal to bliss, is the grave! There the wide wall went east till it dimmed to the viewâ And the wide wall went west till it passed into blue; And the broad gates stood open, inviting that way, Like the hands of the Lord to his children astray. There were high towers, climbing still dazzlingly higher, Till each shone like a fixed guiding pillar of fire; And the angels who watched on their summits afar, So lessened by distance, gleamed each as a star: And the great dome that templed the Father in light, Seemed to swell and to circle and swell on the sightâ As some angel who cleaves his bright way 'mid the spheres, Beholds the blue dome of the earth as he nears. There was musicâmy soul unto memory yields, And hears the low sounds floating over the fieldsâ But, alas! not as then, with its rapturous desireâ Like some bird that sits hushed by the song of a choir; It melted and flowed o'er the walls and the towers, And sweet as if breathed from the lips of the flowersâ As if the bright blossoms, with loving accord, Had risen and sang to the praise of the Lord! Then I thought 'mid that music to wander and wait For the loved ones, just there by the palm at the gate, To begin the great life that no Death can o'ertake, And to dream the great dream that no tumult can break; In the broad world of Beauty, of flowers and blissâ But, alas! I awoke where the thorns grow in this: And the walls of Death's citadel now intervene, And the grave, like a moat, yawns here darkly between: But still, through the mists and the shadows of night, I can follow the stars on those pillars of light; And I know the great gates stand there open and broad, Inviting the way to the City of God. THE TRUANT. Where is the truant? This should be the place Where even now we heard him laugh outright, To greet the sun, as if he saw the face Of some bright angel smiling in the light. Surely the morn hath beckoned him away, Enticing him with glory from afar: Arise! and we may find him in his play, Shining amid the sweetest flowers that are. His little eyes, so full of bright desires, Could not withstand yon orient space of flowers; And he hath 'scaped the intervening briers, The field for bleeding feet which we call ours. It cannot be he wandered out alone; O, rather that dear friend of many charms, Who wooed him in each light that round us shone, Won him at last into his careful arms. O! look again, a little further look, And weep no tear, unless it be for joy, Toward yon sweet field, where flower, and bird, and brook Beguile the glad heart of our truant boy. Look closer still, until your gaze has won And passed the barriers overflowered with stars,â Those morning-glories closing in the sun, And you shall see him through the golden bars. Watch where he goes, still making toward the light, Our angel truant gladly nearing home, While a deep voice from that celestial height Bids us be calm and suffer him to come. RUTH. SUGGESTED BY A STATUE EXECUTED BY MR. ROGERS IN FLORENCE. From age to age, from clime to clime, A spirit, bright as her own morn, She walks the golden fields of Time, As erst amid the yellow corn. A form o'er which the hallowed veil Of years bequeaths a lovelier light, As when the mists of morning sail Round some far isle to make it bright. And as some reaper 'mid the grain, Or binder resting o'er his sheaf, Beheld her on the orient plain, A passing vision bright and brief;â And while he gazed let fall perchance The sheaf or sickle from his handâ Thus even here, as in a trance, Before her kneeling form I stand. But not as then she comes and goes To live in memory alone; The perfect soul before me glows Immortal in the living stone. And while upon her face I gaze And scan her rarely rounded form, The glory of her native days Comes floating o'er me soft and warm;â Comes floating, till this shadowy place Brightens to noontide, and receives The breath of that old harvest space, With all its sunshine and its sheaves! THE MARSEILLAISE. I heard, as in a glorious dream, A clarion thrill the startled air, And saw an answering people stream Through every noisy thoroughfare. There were the old, whose hairs were few, Or white with memory of the days Of Egypt, Moscow, Waterloo,â And now they sang the âMarseillaise!â The aged scholar, pale and wan, Was there within the marshalled line, And, jostled by the noisy van, The poet with his voice divine:â No more could tomes the sage beguile; The bard no longer wooed the praise That dribbles from a monarch's smile, For now they sang the âMarseillaise!â And there were matrons, who of yore Had wept a son or husband slain, Or chanted for their Emperor A long and loud triumphal strain:â Their woe inspired the song no more, Nor yet Napoleon's crown of bays, Which rankly sprang from fields of gore, For now they sang the âMarseillaise!â The peasants, from their hills of vines, Came streaming to the open plains; No more they bore their tax of wines To stagnate in a tyrant's veins; France needed not the purple flood To set her heart and brain ablaze,â A wilder wine was in her blood, For now she sang the âMarseillaise!â The Bourbons' throne was trampled down, And France no longer knelt; but now, Struck with a patriot's hand the crown From off the Orleans' dotard brow;â Released from slavery and tears, She rose and sang fair Freedom's praise, Till far along the future years I heard the swelling âMarseillaise!â THE OLD YEAR. Lo, now, when dark December's gathering storm With heavy wing o'ershadows many a heart, Beside us the old year, with mailÃ©d form, Stands waiting to depart. Weighed down as with a ponderous tale of woe, How dim his eyes, how van his cheeks appear! Like Denmark's spectre king, with motion slow He beckons the young year. A NIGHT THOUGHT. Long have I gazed upon all lovely things, Until my soul was melted into song,â Melted with love, till from its thousand springs The stream of adoration, swift and strong, Swept in its ardor, drowning brain and tongue, Till what I most would say was borne away unsung. The brook is silent when it mirrors most Whate'er is grand or beautiful above; The billow which would woo the flowery coast Dies in the first expression of its love; And could the bard consign to living breath Feelings too deep for thought, the utterance were death! The starless heavens at noon are a delight; The clouds a wonder in their varying play, And beautiful when from their mountainous height The lightning's hand illumes the wall of day:â The noisy storm bursts down, and passing brings The rainbow poised in air on unsubstantial wings. But most I love the melancholy nightâ When with fixed gaze I single out a star, A feeling floods me with a tender lightâ A sense of an existence from afar, A life in other spheres of love and bliss, Communion of true soulsâa loneliness in this! There is a sadness in the midnight skyâ An answering fulness in the heart and brain, Which tells the spirit's vain attempt to fly, And occupy those distant worlds again. At such an hour Death's were a loving trust, If life could then depart in its contempt of dust. It may be that this deep and longing sense Is but the prophecy of life to come; It may be that the soul in going hence May find in some bright star its promised home; And that the Eden lost forever here Smiles welcome to me now from yon suspended sphere. There is a wisdom in the light of stars, A worldless lore which summons me away; This ignorance belongs to earth, which bars The spirit in these darkened walls of clay, And stifles all the soul's aspiring breath;â True knowledge only dawns within the gates of Death. Imprisoned thus, why fear we then to meet The angel who shall ope the dungeon door, And break these galling fetters from our feet, To lead us up from Time's benighted shore? Is it for love of this dark cell of dust, Which, tenantless, awakes but horror and disgust? Long have I mused upon all lovely things: But thou, oh Death! art lovelier than all; Thou sheddest from thy recompensing wings A glory which is hidden by the pallâ The excess of radiance falling from thy plume Throws from the gates of Time a shadow on the tomb. SONG OF THE SERF. I know a lofty lady, And she is wondrous fair; She hath wrought my soul to music As the leaves are wrought by air; And like the air that wakes The foliage into play, She feels no thrill of all she makes When she has passed away. I know a lofty lady Who seldom looks on me, Or when she smiles, her smile is like The moon's upon the sea. As proudly and serene She shines from her domain, Till my spirit heaves beneath her mien, And floods my aching brain. I know a lofty lady:â But I would not wake her scorn By telling all the love I bear, For I am lowly born; So low, and she so highâ And the space between us spread Makes me but as the weeds that lie Beneath her stately tread. BALBOA. From San Domingo's crowded wharf Fernandez' vessel bore, To seek in unknown lands afar The Indian's golden ore. And hid among the freighted casks, Where none might see or know, Was one of Spain's immortal men, Three hundred years ago! But when the fading town and land Had dropped below the sea, He met the captain face to face, And not a fear had he! âWhat villain thou?â Fernandez cried, âAnd wherefore serve us so?â âTo be thy follower,â he replied, Three hundred years ago. He wore a manly form and face, A courage firm and bold, His words fell on his comrades' hearts, Like precious drops of gold. They saw not his ambitious soul; He spoke it notâfor lo! He stood among the common ranks, Three hundred years ago. But when Fernandez' vessel lay At golden Darien, A murmur, born of discontent, Grew loud among the men: And with the word there came the act; And with the sudden blow They raised Balboa from the ranks, Three hundred years ago. And while he took command beneath The banner of his lord, A mighty purpose grasped his soul, As he had grasped the sword. He saw the mountain's fair blue height Whence golden waters flow; Then with his men he scaled the crags, Three hundred years ago. He led them up through tangled brakes, The rivulet's sliding bed, And through the storm of poisoned darts From many an ambush shed. He gained the turret cragâaloneâ And wept! to see below, An ocean, boundless and unknown, Three hundred years ago. And while he raised upon that height The banner of his lord, The mighty purpose grasped him still, As still he grasped his sword. Then down he rushed with all his men, As headlong rivers flow, And plunged breast-deep into the sea, Three hundred years ago. And while he held above his head The conquering flag of Spain, He waved his gleaming sword, and smote The waters of the main: For Rome! for Leon! and Castile! Thrice gave the cleaving blow; And thus Balboa claimed the sea, Three hundred ago. LABOR. âLabor, labor!â sounds the anvil. âLabor, labor, until death!â And the file, with voice discordant, âLabor, endless labor!â saith. While the bellows to the embers Speak of labor in each breath. âLabor, labor!â in the harvest, Saith the whetting of the scythe, And the mill-wheel tells of labor Under waters falling blithe; âLabor, labor!â groan the millstones, To the bands that whirl and writhe. And the woodman tells of labor, In his echo-waking blows; In the forest, in the cabin, 'Tis the dearest word he knows. âLabor, labor!â saith the spirit, And with labor comes repose. âLabor!â saith the loaded wagon, Moving toward the distant mart. âLabor!â groans the heavy steamer, As she cleaves the waves apart. Beating like that iron engine, âLabor, labor!â cries the heart. Yes, the heart of man cries âlabor!â While it labors in the breast. But the Ancient and Eternal, In the Word which He hath blest, Sayeth, âSix days shalt thou labor, On the seventh thou shalt rest!â Then how beautiful at evening, When the toilsome week is done, To behold the blacksmith's anvil Die in darkness with the sun; And to think the doors of labor Are all closing up like one. THE WINDY NIGHT. Alow and aloof, Over the roof, How the midnight tempests howl! With a dreary voice, like the dismal tune Of wolves that bay at the desert moon;â Or whistle and shriek Through limbs that creak, âTu-who! tu-whit!â They cry and flit, âTu-whit! tu-who!â like the solemn owl! Alow and aloof, Over the roof, Sweep the moaning winds amain, And wildly dash The elm and ash, Clattering on the window-sash, With a clatter and patter, Like hail and rain That wellnigh shatter The dusky pane! Alow and aloof, Over the roof, How the tempests swell and roar! Though no foot is astir, Though the cat and the cur Lie dozing along the kitchen floor, There are feet of air On every stair! Through every hallâ Through each gusty door, There's a jostle and bustle, With a silken rustle, Like the meeting of guests at a festival! Alow and aloof, Over the roof, How the stormy tempests swell! And make the vane On the spire complainâ They heave at the steeple with might and main, And burst and sweep Into the belfry, on the bell! They smite it so hard, and they smite it so well, That the sexton tosses his arms in sleep, And dreams he is ringing a funeral knell! A DIRGE FOR A DEAD BIRD. The cage hangs at the window, There's the sunshine on the sill; But where the form and where the voice That never till now were still? The sweet voice hath departed From its feathery home of gold, The little form of yellow dust Lies motionless and cold! Oh, where amid the azure Hath thy sweet spirit fled? I hold my breath and think I hear Its music overhead. Death has not hushed thy spirit, Its joy shall vanish never; The slightest thrill of pleasure born Lives on and lives forever! Throughout the gloomy winter Thy soul shed joy in ours, As it told us of the summer-time Amid the land of flowers. But now thy songs are silent, Except what memory brings; For thou hast folded death within The glory of thy wings! And here thy resting-place shall be Beneath the garden-bower; A bush shall be thy monument, Thy epitaph a flower! THE WITHERING LEAVES. The summer is gone and the autumn is here, And the flowers are strewing their earthly bier; A dreary mist o'er the woodland swims, While rattle the nuts from the windy limbs: From bough to bough the squirrels run At the noise of the hunter's echoing gun, And the partridge flies where my footstep heaves The rustling drifts of the withering leaves. The flocks pursue their southern flightâ Some all the day and some all night! And up from the wooded marshes come The sounds of the pheasant's feathery drum. On the highest bough the mourner crow Sits in his funeral suit of woe: All nature mournsâand my spirit grieves At the noise of my feet in the withering leaves. Oh! I sigh for the days that have passed away, When my life, like the year, had its season of May; When the world was all sunshine and beauty and truth, And the dew bathed my feet in the valley of youth! Then my heart felt its wings, and no bird of the sky Sang over the flowers more joyous than I. But Youth is a fable, and Beauty deceives;â For my footsteps are loud in the withering leaves. And I sigh for the time when the reapers at morn Came down from the hill at the sound of the horn: Or when, dragging the rake, I followed them out While they tossed the light sheaves with their laughter about; Through the field, with boy-daring, barefooted I ran; But the stubbles foreshadowed the path of the man. Now the uplands of life lie all barren of sheavesâ While my footsteps are loud in the withering leaves! THE CLOSING SCENE. Within his sober realm of leafless trees The russent year inhaled the dreamy air; Like some tanned reaper in his hour of ease, When all the fields are lying brown and bare. The gray barns looking from their hazy hills O'er the dim waters widening in the vales, Sent down the air a greeting to the mills, On the dull thunder of alternate flails. All sights were mellowed, and all sounds subdued, The hills seemed farther, and the streams sang low, As in a dream the distant woodman hewed His winter log with many a muffled blow. The embattled forests, erewhile armed in gold, Their banners bright with every martial hue, Now stood, like some sad beaten host of old, Withdrawn afar in Time's remotest blue. On slumbrous wings the vulture held his flight; The dove scarce heard his sighing mate's complaint; And like a star slow drowning in the light, The village church-vane seemed to pale and faint. The sentinel cock upon the hill-side crewâ Crew thrice, and all was stiller than before,â Silent till some replying warder blew His alien horn, and then was heard no more. Where erst the jay, within the elm's tall crest, Made garrulous trouble round her unfledged young, And where the oriole hung her swaying nest, By every light wind like a censer swung:â Where sang the noisy masons of the eaves, The busy swallows, circling ever near, Foreboding, as the rustic mind believes, An early harvest and a plenteous year;â Where every bird which charmed the vernal feast, Shook the sweet slumber from its wings at morn, To warn the reaper of the rosy east,â All now was songless, empty, and forlorn. Alone from out the stubble piped the quail, And croaked the crow through all the dreamy gloom; Alone the pheasant, drumming in the vale, Made echo to the distant cottage loom. There was no bud, no bloom upon the bowers; The spiders wove their thin shrouds night by night; The thistle-down, the only ghost of flowers, Sailed slowly by, passed noiseless out of sight. Amid all this, in this most cheerless air, And where the woodbine shed upon the porch Its crimson leaves, as if the Year stood there Firing the floor with his inverted torch;â Amid all this, the centre of the scene, The white-haired matron, with monotonous tread, Plied the swift wheel, and, with her joyless mien, Sat, like a Fate, and watched the flying thread. She had known Sorrow,âhe had walked with her, Oft supped and broke the bitter ashen crust; And in the dead leaves still she heard the stir Of his black mantle trailing in the dust. While yet her cheek was bright with summer bloom, Her country summoned and she gave her all; And twice War bowed to her his sable plumeâ Regave the swords to rust upon her wall. Regave the swords,âbut not the hand that drew And struck for Liberty its dying blow, Nor him who, to his sire and country true, Fell 'mid the ranks of the invading foe. Long, but not loud, the droning wheel went on, Like the low murmur of a hive at noon; Long, but not loud, the memory of the gone Breathed through her lips a sad and tremulous tune. At last the thread was snappedâher head was bowed; Life dropped the distaff through his hands serene,â And loving neighbors smoothed her careful shroud, While Death and Winter closed the autumn scene. THE PILGRIM TO THE LAND OF SONG. The dews are dry upon my sandal-shoon Which bathed them on the foreign hills of song, And now beneath the white and sultry noon They print the dust which they may wear too long. The flowers by delicate fingers wove at morn Around my pilgrim staff have paled and died, Or dropped into the sand, and lie forlorn, Mute orphans of the airy mountainside. The mingled music in the early gale, Of bees and birds, and maidens among flowers, The brooks, like shepherds, piping down the vale, For these my heart remounts the morning hours. Oh that I might reclimb the dewy dawn, And with the stars sit down by Castalie, And be once more within the shade withdrawn, Mantled with music and with Poesy. Thou blessed bird between me and the heaven, Thou wingÃ©d censer, swinging through the air With incense of pure song,âhow hast thou driven One to the past, that may not linger there! Oh for one wild annihilating hour, Spent with the minstrels of a loftier time; Those giants among bards, whose high songs tower Full many a rood o'er all our new sublime. Oh for an hour with Chaucer, the divine, The morning star of English song confessed; Ushering a day whose slow but sure decline Fades with a fitful glimmering in the west. Oh for that rare auroral time, which brought The light of Shakespeare, and the glorious few, Who, in their glowing robes of deathless thought, Strode knee-deep through Parnassian flowers and dew. The hot sands gleam around me, and I thirst,â The wayside springs have sunk into themselves; And even the little blossoms which they nursed Have vanished from their side, like faithless elves. Whence lead the sandy courses of these rills? Do they foretell a mightier stream at hand, With voice triumphant, worthy of these hills? Where are thy rivers, oh, my native land? A few brave souls have sparkled into sight, With living flashes of celestial art; Souls who might flood the world with new delight, Keep sealed the deepest fountains of the heart. Oh for a cloud to oversweep the West, And with a deluge burst these deeper springs,â A voiceful cloud, with grandeur in its breast, And lightning on its far-impending wings. Oh for one mighty heart and fearless hand! For such, methinks, my country, is thy due,â The embodied spirit of his forest land, Who, scorning not the old, shall sing the new. Here will I rest until the day declines, A voiceless pilgrim toward the land of song; And, like a sentinel, catch the herald signs Of him whose coming hath been stayed too long. A CUP OF WINE TO THE OLD YEAR. I. Come hither, love, come hither, And sit you down by me; And hither run, my little one, And climb upon my knee. But bring the flagon first, my love, And fill to friends and foes, And let the old year dash his beard With wine before he goes. II. Oh, do you not remember The night we let him in, The creaking signs, the windy blinds, The universal din;â The melancholy sounds which bade The poor old year adieu; The sudden clamor and the bells That welcomed in the new? He brought to us a world of hope Beneath his robe of snows:â Then let the old year dash his beard With wine before he goes. III. Oh, then the year was young and fair, And loved all joyful things; And under his bright mantle hid The warning of his wings. And you remember how the Spring Beguiled him to her bowers;â How Summer next exalted him Unto her throne of flowers;â And how the reaper, Autumn, crowned Him 'mid the sheaves and shocks,â You still may see the tangled straws In his disordered locks. The yellow wheat, the crimson leaves, With purple grapes, were there; Till, Bacchus-like, he wore the proof Of plenty 'mid his hairâ A proof that wooes in harvest homes Brown Labor to repose:â Then let the old year dash his beard With wine before he goes. IV. But soon the Winter came and took His glory quite away: A frosty rime o'erspread his chin, And all his hair went gray; His crown has fallen to his feet, And withers where he stands, While some invisible horror shakes The old man by the hands. Oh, woo him from his cloud of grief And from his dream of woes; And bid the old year dash his beard With wine before he goes. V. For he hath brought us some new friends, And made the old more dear, And shown how love may constant prove, And friendship be sincere. Though it may be some venomed tooth Hath wrought against the file; And though perchance a Janus' face Hath cursed us with its smile:â Come, fill the goblet till its rim With Lethe overflows; The year shall drown their memory With wine before he goes. VI. But hark! a music nears and nears,â As if the singing stars Were driving closer to the earth In their triumphal cars! And hark! the sudden pealing crash Of one who will not wait, But flings into the ringing dark Old Winter's crystal gate. A sigh is on the midnight air,â A ghost is on the lawn,â The broken goblet strews the floor,â The poor old year is gone! THE AWAKENING YEAR. The bluebirds and the violets Are with us once again, And promises of summer spot The hill-side and the plain. The clouds around the mountain-tops Are riding on the breeze, Their trailing azure trains of mist Are tangled in the trees. The snow-drifts, which have lain so long, Haunting the hidden nooks, Like guilty ghosts have slipped away, Unseen, into the brooks. The streams are fed with generous rains, They drink the wayside springs, And flutter down from crag to crag Upon their foamy wings. Through all the long wet nights they brawl, By mountain homes remote, Till woodmen in their sleep behold Their ample rafts afloat. The lazy wheel, that hung so dry Above the idle stream, Whirls wildly in the misty dark, And through the miller's dream. Loud torrent unto torrent calls, Till at the mountain's feet, Flashing afar their spectral light, The noisy waters meet. They meet, and through the lowlands sweep, Toward briny bay and lake, Proclaiming to the distant towns, âThe country is awake!â PROLOGUE TO AN UNPUBLISHED SERIO-COMIC POEM. INSCRIBED TO GEORGE H. BOKER. I. Dear friend, while now the dews are shed Along the vintage-crownÃ©d Rhine; And day departs with purple tread, Fresh dripping from the land of wine: Here, o'er a flask of Rudesheim, Your shade with me shall drain the bowl, While in this passing cup of rhyme I pour the fulness of my soul. And you shall drain as I have drained The golden goblet of your song, Till in my heart a pleasure reigned Like Bacchus 'mid his wreathÃ©d throng. II. And blame me not, that while she sings My Muse not always strives to soar,â If, folding her o'erwearied wings, She warbles when her flight is o'er. It may be that more oft than well I've woke the melancholy lyre; Then frown not if I break the spell And touch at times a lighter wire. If it has been my wont to quaff And drain the chalice' darker tide, What marvel, if I stop and laugh To see the satyrs on its side? III. What though you bid me hoard my hours, And say you see my life-star pale, Have I not walked amid the flowers That bloom in the enchanted vale? Though I had, on a lotus bed, Dreamed the wild dreams that few may dare, Till the o'ershadowing laurel shed Its leaves of poison on my hair; I do believe the gods are just,â They will not break the unfinished chord, Nor dash the goblet in the dust Until its latest draught be poured. IV. Then fill, dear friend, again immerse The lip that shall approve the rhyme; A richer beauty gilds the verse When seen through cups of Rudesheim. And if within my tuneful task I wake too oft the mournful note, Then pour again the golden flask, For it has laughter in its throat. And while I deem you sit and quaff, I shall no longer be alone, Nor think my dusty pack and staff My sole companions in Cologne. VENICE. I. Night on the Adriatic, night! And like a mirage of the plain, With all her marvellous domes of light, Pale Venice looms along the main. No sound from the receding shore,â No sound from all the broad lagoon, Save where the light and springing oar Brightens our track beneath the moon:â Or save where yon high campanile Gives to the listening sea its chime; Or where those dusky giants wheel And smite the ringing helm of Time. 'Tis past,âand Venice drops to rest; Alas! hers is a sad repose, While in her brain and on her breast Tramples the vision of her foes. Erewhile from her sad dream of pain She rose upon her native flood, And struggled with the Tyrant's chain, Till every link was stained with blood. The Austrian pirate, wounded, spurned, Fled howling to the sheltering shore, But, gathering all his crew, returned And bound the Ocean Queen once more. 'Tis past,âand Venice prostrate lies,â And, snarling round her couch of woes, The watch-dogs, with the jealous eyes, Scowl where the stranger comes or goes. II. Lo! here awhile suspend the oar; Rest in the Mocenigo's shade, For Genius hath within this door His charmed, though transient, dwelling made. Somewhat of âHarold'sâ spirit yet, Methinks, still lights these crumbling halls; For where the flame of song is set It burns, though all the temple falls. Oh, tell me not those days were given To Passion and her pampered brood; Or that the eagle stoops from heaven To dye his talons deep in blood. I hear alone his deathless strain From sacred inspiration won, As I would only watch again The eagle when he nears the sun. III. Oh, would some friend were near me now, Some friend well tried and cherished long, To share the scene;âbut chiefly thou, Sole source and object of my song. By Olivola's dome and tower, What joy to clasp thy hand in mine, While through my heart this sacred hour Thy voice should melt like mellow wine. What time or place so fit as this To bid the gondolier withhold, And dream through one soft age of bliss The olden story, never old? The domes suspended in the sky Swim all above me broad and fair; And in the wave their shadows lie,â Twin phantoms of the sea and air. O'er all the scene a halo plays, Slow fading, but how lovely yet; For here the brightness of past days Still lingers, though the sun is set. Oft in my bright and boyish hours I lived in dreams what now I live, And saw these palaces and towers In all the light romance can give. They rose along my native stream, They charmed the lakelet in the glen; But in this hour the waking dream More frail and dream-like seems than then. A matchless scene, a matchless night, A tide below, a moon above; An hour for music and delight, For gliding gondolas and love! But here, alas! you hark in vain,â When Venice fell her music died; And voiceless as a funeral train, The blackened barges swim the tide. The harp, which Tasso loved to wake, Hangs on the willow where it sleeps, And while the light strings sigh or break, Pale Venice by the water weeps. IV. 'Tis past,âand weary droops the wing That thus hath borne me idly on; The thoughts I have essayed to sing Are but as bubbles touched and gone. But, Venice, cold his soul must be, Who, looking on thy beauty, hears The story of thy wrongs, if he Is moved to neither song nor tears. To glide by temples fair and proud, Between deserted marble walls, Or see the hireling foeman crowd Rough-shod her noblest palace halls; To know her left to Vandal foes Until her nest be robbed and gone,â To see her bleeding breast, which shows How dies the Adriatic swan;â To know that all her wings are shorn; That Fate has written her decree, That soon the nations here shall mourn The lone Palmyra of the sea;â Where waved her vassal flags of yore By valor in the Orient won; To see the Austrian vulture soar, A blot against the morning sun;â To hear a rough and foreign speech Commanding the old ocean mart.â Are mournful sights and sounds that reach, And wake to pity, all the heart. NIGHTFALL. IN MEMORY OF A POET. I saw in the silent afternoon The overladen sun go down; While, in the opposing sky, the moon. Between the steeples of the town, Went upward, like a golden scale, Outweighed by that which sank beyond; And over the river, and over the vale, With odors from the lily-pond, The purple vapors calmly swung; And, gathering in the twilight trees, The many vesper minstrels sung Their plaintive mid-day memories, Till, one by one, they dropped away From music into slumber deep; And now the very woodlands lay Folding their shadowy wings in sleep. Oh, Peace! that like a vesper psalm Hallows the daylight at its close; Oh, Sleep! that like the vapor's calm Mantles the spirit in repose,â Through all the twilight falling dim, Through all the song which passed away, Ye did not stoop your wings to him Whose shallop on the river lay Without an oar, without a helm;â His great soul in his marvellous eyes Gazing on from realm to realm Through all the world of mysteries! L'ENVOI. I bring the flower you asked of me, A simple bloom, nor bright nor rare, But like a star its light will be Within the darkness of your hair. It grew not in those guarded bowers Where rustling fountains sift their spray, But gladly drank the common showers Of dew beside the dusty way. It may be in its humble sphere It cheered the pilgrim of the road, And shed as blest an alms as e'er The generous hand of Wealth bestowed. Or though, save mine, it met no eye, But secretly looked up and grew, And from the loving air and sky Its little store of beauty drew, And though it breathed its small perfumes So low they did not woo the bee,â Exalted, how it shines and blooms, Above all flowers, since worn by thee. And thus the song you bade me sing May be a rude and artless lay, And yet it grew a sacred thing To bless me on Life's dusty way. And unto this, my humble strain, How much of beauty shall belong, If thou wilt in thy memory deign To wear my simple flower of song! SYLVIA; OR, THE LAST SHEPHERD. AN ECLOGUE. AND OTHER POEMS. TO HENRY C. TOWNSEND, ESQ. To you, my friend, whose youthful feet have known The same bright hills and valleys as my own; Whose eye learned beauty from the self-same scene, Which, still remembered, keeps our pathways green: From the same minstrel-stream and poet-birds Learned what I oft would fain recall in words:â To you I bring this handful of wild flowers, By memory plucked from those dear fields of ours; And when their freshness and their perfume die, On friendship's shrine still let them fondly lie. PRELUDE. THE MERRY MOWERS. âHere 'mid the clover's crimson realm We'll rest us through the glowing noon, Beneath this broad and liberal elm, Slow nodding to his hundredth June. âOn this low branch our scythes shall sway, Fresh reeking from the field in bloom; While, breathing o'er the new-mown hay, The air shall fan us with perfume. âAnd here the cottage maid shall spread The viands on the stainless cloth,â The golden prints, the snow-white bread, The chilly pitcher crowned with froth. âAnd you, fair youth, whose shepherd look Brings visions of the pastoral time,â Your hay-fork shouldered like a crook, Your speech the natural voice of rhyme,â âAlthough the world is far too ripe To hark,âor, hearkening, would disdain,â Come, pour along your fancied pipe The music of some rustic strain. âWe'll listen as we list the birds,â And, being pleased, will hold it wise; And deem we sit 'mid flocks and herds Beneath the far Arcadian skies.â Thus spake the mowers; while the maid, The fairest daughter of the realm, Stood twining in the happy shade A wreath of mingled oak and elm. And this, with acorns interwound, And violets inlaid with care, Fame's temporary priestess bound In freshness round her druid hair. The breeze with sudden pleasure played, And, dancing in from bough to bough, Let one slant sunbeam down, which stayed A moment on the crownÃ©d brow. The birds, as with a new-born thrill, Sang as they only sing at morn, While through the noon from hill to hill Echoed the winding harvest-horn. With upturned face and lips apart, He mused a little, but not long; For clustered in his boundless heart Sang all the morning stars of song. THE ECLOGUE. I. In middle of a noble space, Of antique wood and boundless plain, Queen Sylvia, regent of all grace, Held long-descended reign. The diadem her forehead wore Was her bright hair, a golden band; And she, as sceptre, ever bore A distaff in her hand. In russet train, with rustling tread, She walked like morning, dewy-eyed, And, like Saint Agnes, ever led A white lamb at her side. And she to all the flowery land Was dear as are the summer skies; And round her waving mulberry wand Swarmed all the butterflies. Queen was she of the flaxen skein, And empress of the snowy fleece, And o'er the silkworm's small domain Held guard in days of peace. II. To own her sway the woods were proud, The solemn forest, wreathed and old; To her the plumÃ©d harvests bowed Their rustling ranks of gold. Mantled in majesty complete, She walked among her flocks and herds; Where'er she moved, with voices sweet, Sang all her laureate birds. All happy sounds waved softly near, With perfume from the fields of dew; From every hill, bold chanticleer His silver clarion blew. The bees her honey-harvest reaped, The fields were murmurous with their glee; And, loyal to her hives, they heaped Her waxen treasury. All pleasures round her loved to press, To sing their sweetest madrigals;â She never knew the weariness Which dwells in grander halls. III. What time came in the welcome spring, The happy maiden looked abroad, And saw her lover gayly fling The flax athwart the sod. Hither and thither the yellow seed Young Leon sprinkled o'er the plain, As a farmer to his feathery breed Full hands of golden grain. As o'er the yielding mould he swayed, He whistled to his measured tread A happy tune; for he saw the maid Spinning the future thread, Or saw the shuttle in her room Fly, like a bird, from hand to hand; And then his arm, as at a loom, Swung wider o'er the land. He wondered what the woof would be,â Or for the poor, or for the proud? A bridal garment fluttering free? Or formal winding-shroud? IV. Then May recrossed the southern hill,â Her heralds thronged the elms and eaves; And Nature, with a sudden thrill, Burst all her buds to leaves. Loud o'er the slope a streamlet flung Fresh music from its mountain springs, As if a thousand birds there sung And flashed their azure wings. âFlow on,â the maiden sang, âand whirl, Sweet stream, your music o'er the hill, And touch with your light foot of pearl The wheel of yonder mill.â It touched the wheel, and in the vale Died from the ear and passed from view,â Like a singing bird that is seen to sail Into the distant blue;â Died where the river shone below, Where white sails through the vapor glowed, Like great archangels moving slow On some celestial road. V. How sweet it is when twilight wakes A many-voicÃ©d eve in May,â When Sylvia's western casement takes The farewell flame of day: When cattle from the upland lead Or drive their lengthening shadows home; While bringing from the odorous mead Deep pails of snowy foam, The milkmaid sings, and, while she stoops, Her hands keep time; the night-hawk's wail Pierces the twilight, till he swoops And mocks the sounding pail. Then sings the robin, he who wears A sunset memory on his breast, Pouring his vesper hymns and prayers To the red shrine of the west. Deep in the grove the woodland sprites Start into frequent music brief; And there the whippoorwill recites The ballad of his grief. The ploughs turn home; the anvils cease; The forge has faded with the sun; The heart of the loom is soothed to peace, And the toiling day is done. VI. A lover's heart hath no repose; 'Tis ever thundering in his ear The story of his joys and woes,â The light remote, the shadow near. And Leon, penning his fleecy stock, Felt hope as painful as despair, While one by one heaven's starry flock Came up the fields of air. True shepherd,âlike the men of old,â He knew to call each as it came; And, as his flock leaped in the fold, Each had a starry name. There, clustered close in slumbrous peace, He gazed on them with shepherd pride, And saw each deep and pillowy fleece Through Sylvia's soft hands glide. In that still hour, where none might mark, He leaned against the shadowy bars; Soft tearlight blurred the deepening dark And doubled all the stars. And, starlike, through the valley dim The tapers shot their guiding rays; But one there was which seemed to him To set the night ablaze. To his impatient feet it flowed, A stream of gold along the sod; Then like the road to glory glowed The love-lit path he trod! VII. Out of her tent, as one afraid, The moon along the purple field Stole like an oriental maid, Her beauty half concealed. And, peering with her vestal torch Between the vines at Sylvia's door, She saw two shadows in the porch Pass and repass the floor. On the far hill the dreary hound Saddened the evening with his howl; In the near groveâa shuddering soundâ Echoed the ominous owl. Three times, as at a robber band, The guardian mastiff leaped his chain; Three times the hand in Leon's hand Grew chill and shook with pain. And Sylvia said, âThese, Leon, these Are the dismal sounds which three nights past Came herald to the mysteries Of dreams too sad to last. VIII. âFirst of the mournful sights, I saw Our flocks fly bleating from a hound, And many a one his savage jaw Dragged bleeding to the ground. âThe rest sought shelter in despair, And in a brake were robbed and torn; The cruel hound had an ally there In every brier and thorn. âIn nightmare chains my feet were set, For I could neither move nor scream: Oh, Leon, it makes me tremble yet, Although 'twas but a dream! âAnon I struggled forth, and took From off our mastiff's neck the chain; He leaped the gate, he leaped the brook, And snarled across the plain. âThen how they fought! My sight grew dim, In straining to the field remote: At length he threw that blood-hound grim, And held him by the throat! IX. âAnd then I heard your neighing train,â Its silver bells rang down the breeze,â And saw the white arch of your wain Between the roadside trees. âAnnounced as by an ocean storm, A horseman from the east in ire Rode to retrieve his hound: his form Was robed in scarlet fire. âBut when you saw our murdered fieldâ And saw in midst the struggling houndsâ And him whose sword made threat to wield Destruction o'er our grounds,â âYou loosed the best steed of your team, And seized the weapon nearest hand,â Then sped the hill and leaped the stream, And bade the invader stand. âThen came the horrid sight and sound: At length I saw the foe retreat, And swooned for joy; but waking found You bleeding at my feet! X. âI bore you in; with my own hand I tended you long nights and days; And heard with pride how all the land Was ringing with your praise. âBut when your deepest wounds were well,â This, Leon, is the saddest part,â A lady came with witching spell, And claimed you, hand and heart. âShe came in all her southern pride; And, though she was as morning bright, An Afric bondmaid at her side Stooped like a starless night. âShe moved as she were monarch born, And smiled her sweetest smile on you; But scorned me with her lofty scorn, Until I shrank from view. âWhen you were gone, all hope had flown,â Grief held to me her bitter crust; My distaff dropped, my loom o'erthrown Lay trampled in the dust. XI. âI know such dreams are empty, vain; And yet may rest upon the heart, Like chillness of a summer rain After the clouds depart. âAnd still the dream went on:âeach hour Some new-born wonder filled the dream: First came the laborers to o'erpower And chain our little stream. âA giant prison-wall they made;â Our brook, recoiling in her fears, Over our meadows wildly strayed, And drowned them with her tears. âAnd then they reared a stately home,â Not one, but many, for this queen; The gleam of tower and spire and dome Through all the land was seen. âAnd when her orgies swelled the breeze, Loudly a mile away or more Was borne the voice of her revelries, The rattle and the roar. XII. âYou grew to her more fond and near, And mine no more! Ah, never more You brought the antlered forest deer And laid it at my door. âAnd ever round the hall and hearth, These branching emblems of the chase Mocked me with memory of the mirth Which once made bright the place. âNo more 'neath autumn's sun or cloud You paid to me the pleasing tax Of labor at the swingle loud, Breaking the brittle flax. âNo more when winter walked our clime We woke the evening-lighted room With laugh and song, still keeping time To whirring wheel or loom. âNor blazed the great logs as of yore, Cheered with the cricket's pastoral song; The cider and the nuts were o'er, And gone the jovial throng. âThe hearth was basely narrowed down; The antlered walls were stripped and bare; The oaken floor no more was known,â A foreign woof was there. XIII. âAnd never more your ringing team Made music in our happy dale; Instead, an earthquake winged with steam Roared through our sundered vale. âAnd where yon river seaward runs, The white-winged barges ceased to roam; Instead, came great leviathans Trampling the waves to foam. âAnd there was rushing to and fro, As if the nation suddenly Made haste to meet some foreign foe Impending on the sea. âAnd all this horrid roar and rageâ The clash of steel and flash of ireâ Was the giant march of the Conquering Age Flapping his flags of fire! âHe strode the land from east to west:â Then death in my despair was sweet, And soon above my buried breast Trampled the world's loud feet. âThe dreary dream is past and told; But, Leon, swear to still be true, Even though with charms a thousand-fold A queen should smile on you.â This, Leon swore,âswore still to pay The fealty he long had borne:â The years which followed best can say If Leon was forsworn. XIV. âForsworn!â The fields all sighed, âforsworn!â When Sylvia pined into her shroud; And all the pastures lay forlorn, O'ershadowed with a cloud. The homesteads wept with childish sob, âForsworn!â and every wheel was dumb; The looms were muffled, each low throb Was like a funeral drum. The maidens hid in Maytime grots, Their distaffs twined with blossoms sweet, With pansies and forget-me-nots, And laid them at her feet. âForsworn!â they sighed, and sprinkled o'er Her breast the loveliest flowers of May; And then these fair pall-bearers bore Her gentle dust away. âForsworn!â The grandams moved about Like useless shadows in their gloom; And oft they brought their distaffs out, And sat beside her tomb. âForsworn!â All nature sighs, âforsworn!â And Sylvia's is a nameless grave; The blossoms which above her mourn 'Mid tangled grasses wave. XV. Proud Leon sits beside his bride, His chariot manned by Nubian grooms,â His lady rustling in the pride Of stuffs of foreign looms. Secure, important, and serene, The master of a wide domain, He looks abroad with lordly mien,â This once poor shepherd swain. You scarce would think, to see him now, In all his grandeur puffed and full, He e'er had guided flock or plough In simple, homespun wool. The chain of gold is still a chain;â There may be moments he would pay The bulk of all his marvellous gain For what has passed away! CONCLUSION. THE MOURNFUL MOWERS. Thus sang the shepherd crowned at noon, And every breast was heaved with sighs;â Attracted by the tree and tune, The wingÃ©d singers left the skies. Close to the minstrel sat the maid; His song had drawn her fondly near: Her large and dewy eyes betrayed The secret to her bosom dear. The factory-people through the fields, Pale men and maids and children pale, Listened, forgetful of the wheels, Till the loud summons woke the vale. And all the mowers rising said, âThe world has lost its dewy prime; Alas! the Golden age is dead, And we are of the Iron time! âThe wheel and loom have left our homes,â Our maidens sit with empty hands, Or toil beneath yon roaring domes, And fill the factory's pallid bands. âThe fields are swept as by a war, Our harvests are no longer blithe; Yonder the iron mower's car Comes with his devastating scythe. âThey lay us waste by fire and steel, Besiege us to our very doors; Our crops before the driving wheel Fall captive to the conquerors. âThe pastoral age is dead, is dead! Of all the happy ages chief; Let every mower bow his head, In token of sincerest grief. âAnd let our brows be thickly bound With every saddest flower that blows; And all our scythes be deeply wound With every mournful leaf that grows.â Thus sang the mowers; and they said, âThe world has lost its dewy prime; Alas! the Golden age is dead, And we are of the Iron time!â Each wreathed his scythe and twined his head; They took their slow way through the plain: The minstrel and the maiden led Across the fields the solemn train. The air was rife with clamorous sounds, Of clattering factoryâthundering forge,â Conveyed from the remotest bounds Of smoky plain and mountain gorge. Here, with a sudden shriek and roar, The rattling engine thundered by; A steamer past the neighboring shore Convulsed the river and the sky. The brook that erewhile laughed abroad, And o'er one light wheel loved to play, Now, like a felon, groaning trod Its hundred treadmills night and day. The fields were tilled with steeds of steam, Whose fearful neighing shook the vales; Along the road there rang no team,â The barns were loud, but not with flails. And still the mournful mowers said, âThe world has lost its dewy prime; Alas! the Golden age is dead, And we are of the Iron time!â AIRS FROM ALPLAND. TO MARCUS L. WARD, ESQ. To you, who, in the broad commercial plain, Sittest where calm Passaic seeks the main, I bring these mountain airs,âand wake once more The minstrel harp you kindly heard of yore: Beside your fire the heavenward hill would rear, And give the pleasures of the mountaineer; Would wake the music of the marvellous pass, And loose the avalanche's monster mass; Recall, had I such mastery o'er the strings, From St. Bernard the tempest's wildest wings! Assured the dreariest scene would soon depart Before your glowing hearth and genial heart! THE LISTENERS. Under the vernal tents of shadowy trees,â A druid depth of oaken solitude, The home of wild flowers and the haunt of bees, The native vale of many a minstrel brood,â There ran a stream in its bewildering mood Of song and silence and low whispering trance; And stream-like paths went winding through the wood From rock to glen, the temples of Romance, And there were lawns where Mirth might lead her wreathÃ©d dance. Upon a knoll o'ergrown with mosses sweet, While dropt the sun adown the afternoon, A group of maidens made their merry seat,â June all around, and in their hearts was June; And on their flowery lips the mellow tune Of early summer; and with fingers fair Shaking the wingÃ©d spoilers in their swoon From honey-bells of blossoms bright and rare, They wove their woodland wreaths and decked each other's hair. But when they saw me pass between the trees, Slow making toward the streamlet's yellow sands, âCome hither, thou new-comer from the seas, And sing to us fresh songs of foreign lands!â They cried, and placed a harp into my hands: And straightway I went stumbling o'er the strings, As best I could, to answer their demands,â Like some poor bird that with his trembling wings Beats at the caging wires, and to his mistress sings. THE FAIR PILGRIM. âUpon her little palfrey white Y? maiden sitteth eke upright, Her hair is black as y? midnight, Her eyes also. Her cheeks have snary dimples in, And Cupid's thumb hath touched her chin, And silken soft her lily skin, Her lips like crimson rose-leaves bin About her teeth of snow.â Time was when, with the unrestraint Of an enamored soul and hand,â In lieu of these cold words, that faint And waver like a willow wand Before the vision I would paint,â I would have seized the ready brush, And, with the limner's clearer art, Poured out the softer hues that flush And flow within the painter's heart; Have shown you where she passed or stood, Between the Alpine light and shade; Her stately form, her air subdued, Her dark eye mellowing to the mood That round her inmost spirit played. I would have wrought the daylight through To give what yet before me beams, And ceased at eve but to renew The impassioned labor in my dreams. But this is past: life takes and gives, And o'er the dust of hopes long gone The vision brightens as it lives, And mocks the hand that would have drawn Along those windings high and vast, Through frequent sun and shade she stole, And all the Alpine splendor passed Into the chambers of her soul; For she was of that better clay Which treads not oft this earthly stage; Such charmeÃ©d spirits lose their way But once or twice into an age. Her voice was one that thrills and clings Forever in the hearer's bosom,â As when a bee with flashing wings Cleaves to the centre of a blossom,â And with the mule-bells' measured chime Her fancies rung themselves to rhyme. SONG ON ST. BERNARD. Oh, it is a pleasure rare Ever to be climbing so, Winding upward through the air, Till the cloud is left below! Upward and forever round On the stairway of the stream, With the motion and the sound Of processions in a dream; While the world below all this Lies a fathomless abyss. Freedom singeth ever here, Where her sandals print the snow, And to her the pines are dear, Freely rocking to and fro; Swinging oft like stately ships, Where the billowy tempests sport; Or, as when the anchor slips Down the dreamy wave in port, Standing silent as they list Where the zephyrs furl the mist. Here the well-springs drop their pearls, All to Freedom's music strung; And the brooks, like mountain girls, Sing the songs of Freedom's tongue. And the great hills, stern and stanch, Guard her valleys and her lakes, And the rolling avalanche Blocks the path the invader makes, While her eagle, like a flag, Floats in triumph o'er the crag! I HAVE LOOKED ON A FACE. I have looked on a face that has looked in my heart, As deep as the moon ever fathoms a wave; As uncomprehended it came to depart, While a sense of its glory was all that it gave. Where she passed the Alp blossoms grew pallid and shrank, As a taper in sunlight sinks faint and aghast; And now o'er her path swims a terrible blank, A gulf in the air where her beauty hath passed. But her light in my heart, which no time can eclipse, Seems to brighten and smile in the joy it confers; And a voice which is shed from aerial lips Breathes a music I know which can only be hers! THE CHAMOIS-HUNTER. âThere!âsee you not upon the face Of yonder far and dizzy height A something with slow-moving pace, Now faintly seen, now lost to sight? And now again, with downward spring, As if supported by a wing, It drops, then scarcely seems to crawl Along the smooth and shining wall. Is it a bird? or beast whose lair Is hid within some cavern there? Or some adventurer who hath striven To scale that Babel wall to heaven? In sooth, methinks, there never yawned A passage to the world beyond Of shorter access than now lies Around that climber in the skies.â Then spake the guide:â âUnless I err, There is but one adventurer From Basle unto Geneva's lake, From Neufchatel to SplÃ¼gen pass, Of all who freely scale the brow Of ice that crowns the Mer-de-glace, Or climbs the slippery Rosenlau, Who dares that dreadful path to take. Not him who sprang from ridge to ridge, And passed us on the Devil's Bridge, And told you all that perilous tale Which made your rosy cheeks grow pale. Nor him who in the Grimsel sang Among his fellows of the chase, Until the laughing rafters rang And scared all slumber from the place; Or, if the weary traveller slept, Through all his dream the chamois swept. There never yet was hunter born So fierce of soul, so lithe of limb, So fearless on the mountain's rim, As Herman of the Wetterhorn. He robbed the Jungfrau of her fame, And put the chamois' flight to shame; He takes the wild crag by the brow, As boatman might his shallop-prow. The avalanche he loves to dare, To shout amid the wild uproar Until the thundering vale is full,â Then stands upon the ruins there, Like some brave Spanish matador With foot upon the fallen bull! âIf all goes well as it should go, Two toiling hours of steady pace Must bring us to the ribs of snow That lie around the broken base Of that far height, and one hour more Should find us at the convent door; And there perchance will Herman be, His shoulder laden with chamois, His heart a mountain well of glee, His voice an alpine gust of joy.â Two hours they toiled with steady pace, And they had gained that rocky base. But when the winding line had earned A jutting crag and partly turned, A sharp and sudden rifle-crack Broke through the thin and icy air, Jarring the frozen silence there, And rattled down the steep hill-side; But ere the snow-cliffs gave it back, A wounded chamois in their track Rolled bleeding, and there died! The startled rider checked his rein; And the pedestrian stayed his pace: With looks of wonder or of pain Each stared into the other's face. And when the maid's first shock of fear In gentle tremblings passed away, Her dark eye glistening with a tear, She gazed where the dead creature lay. The graceful head,âthe slender horns,â The eyes which Death seemed scarce to dull, So wildly sad,âso beautiful! The polished hoofs,âthe shining form,â The limbs that had outsped the storm, Thrilled her with wonder and with woe, Until she would have given a part Of the dear life-blood of her heart To wake once more that gentle eye And bid the eagle's rival fly Unto his native crags of snow. Before their wonder all had passed, A voice came down the rising blast,â A voice that gayly soared and fell Along the wild winds' wandering swell; A carol like a flying bird'sâ Faint were the notes at first, and then The sounds ran eddying into words That sang of mirth and Meyringen. SONG OF THE CHAMOIS-HUNTER. On, brave may be those bands, perchance, Who ride where tropic deserts glow,â Who bring with lasso and with lance The tiger to their saddle's prow:â But I would climb the snowy track Alone, as I have ever been, And with a chamois on my back, Descend to merry Meyringen. Oh, they may sing of eyes of jet, That melt in passion's dreamy glance,â Of forms that to the castanet Sway through the languor of the dance:â But let me clasp some blue-eyed girl, Whose arms impulsive clasp again; And through a storm of music whirl The dizzy waltz at Meyringen. And they may sing, as oft they will, Of joy beneath the southern vine, And in luxurious banquets fill Their goblets with the orient wine:â But when the Alpland winter rolls His tempests over hill and glen, Let me sit 'mid the steaming bowls That cheer the nights at Meyringen. Brave men are there with hands adroit At every game our land deems good,â To wrestle, or to swing the quoit, Or drain the bowl of brotherhood:â And when the last wild chase is through, We'll sit together, gray-haired men, And, with the gay Lisette to brew, Once more be young in Meyringen. THE WARNING. The song was done; they raised their eyes, And saw between them and the skies A figure standing dark and mute That on a gleaming rifle leant, And all his form from head to foot Was painted on the firmament. So still he stood, the quickest eye In its first gazing toward the sky Glanced twice, before discerning if The dusky shape were man or cliff. At length, a voiceâso high and loud It seemed descending from the cloudâ Swept down along the swelling gale, And made the stoutest hearer quail. âI charge ye, on! I charge ye, speed! And every gust proclaims the need. By all the surest mountain signs, By all the wailing of the winds,â And by the sobbing of the pines,â And by that avalanche which now Gives warning through the vale below,â By yonder rising cloud, whose wrath Makes desperate the safest path, I know the blast must soon perform The bidding of the monarch storm.â STORM ON ST. BERNARD. Oh, Heaven, it is a fearful thing Beneath the tempest's beating wing To struggle, like a stricken hare When swoops the monarch bird of air; To breast the loud winds' fitful spasms, To brave the cloud and shun the chasms, Tossed like a fretted shallop-sail Between the ocean and the gale. Along the valley, loud and fleet, The rising tempest leapt and roared, And scaled the Alp, till from his seat The throned Eternity of Snow His frequent avalanches poured In thunder to the storm below. The laden tempest wildly broke O'er roaring chasms and rattling cliffs, And on the pathway piled the drifts; And every gust was like a wolf,â And there was one at every cloak,â That, snarling, dragged toward the gulf. The staggering mule scarce kept his pace, With ears thrown back and shoulders bowed; The surest guide could barely trace The difference 'twixt earth and cloud; And every form, from foot to face, Was in a winding-sheet of snow: The wind, 'twas like the voice of woe That howled above their burial-place! And now, to crown their fears, a roar Like ocean battling with the shore, Or like that sound which night and day Breaks through Niagara's veil of spray, From some great height within the cloud, To some immeasured valley driven, Swept down, and with a voice so loud It seemed as it would shatter heaven! The bravest quailed; it swept so near, It made the ruddiest cheek to blanch, While look replied to look in fear, âThe avalanche! The avalanche!â It forced the foremost to recoil, Before its sideward billows thrown,â Who cried, âO God! Here ends our toil! The path is overswept and gone!â The night came down. The ghostly dark, Made ghostlier by its sheet of snow, Wailed round them its tempestuous woe, Like Death's announcing courier! âHark! There, heard you not the alp-hound's bark? And there again! and there! Ah, no, 'Tis but the blast that mocks us so!â Then through the thick and blackening mist Death glared on them, and breathed so near, Some felt his breath grow almost warm, The while he whispered in their ear Of sleep that should out-dream the storm. Then lower drooped their lids,âwhen, âList! Now, heard you not the storm-bell ring? And there again, and twice, and thrice! Ah, no, 'tis but the thundering Of tempests on a crag of ice!â Death smiled on them, and it seemed good On such a mellow bed to lie: The storm was like a lullaby, And drowsy pleasure soothed their blood. But still the sturdy, practised guide His unremitting labor plied; Now this one shook until he woke, And closer wrapt the other's cloak,â Still shouting with his utmost breath, To startle back the hand of Death, Brave words of cheer! âBut, hark again.â Between the blasts the sound is plain; The storm, inhaling, lulls,âand hark! It isâit is! the alp-dog's bark! And on the tempest's passing swellâ The voice of cheer so long debarredâ There swings the Convent's guiding-bell, The sacred bell of Saint Bernard!â Then how they gained, though chilled and faint, The Convent's hospitable door, And breathed their blessing on the saint Who guards the traveller as of yore,â Were long to tell:âAnd then the night And unhoused winter of the height, Were rude for audience such as mine; The harp, too, wakes to more delight, The fingers take a freer flight, When warmed between the fire and wine, The storm around the fount of song Has blown its blast so chill and long, What marvel if it freeze or fail, Or that its spray returns in hail! Or, rather, round my muse's wings The encumbering snow, though melting, clings So thickly, she can scarce do more Than flounder where she most would soar! The hand benumbed, reviving, stings, And with thick touches only brings The harp-tones out by fits and spells,â You needs must note how all the strings Together jar like icicles! Then heap the hearth and spread the board, And let the glowing flasks be poured, While I beside the roaring fire Melt out the music of my lyre. FANCIES IN THE FIRELIGHT, IN THE CONVENT OF ST. BERNARD. Oh, it is a joy to gaze Where the great logs lie ablaze; Thus to list the garrulous flame Muttering like some ancient dame; And to hear the sap recount Stories of its native mount, Telling of the summer weather, When the trees swayed all together,â How the little birds would launch Arrowy songs from branch to branch, Till the leaves with pleasure glistened, And each great bough hung and listened To the song of thrush and linnet, When securely lodged within it, With all pleasant sounds that dally Round the hill and in the valley; Till each log and branch and splinter On the ancient hearth of Winter Can do naught but tell the story Of its transient summer glory. Oh, there's tranquil joy in gazing Where these great logs lie a blazing, While the wizard flame is sparkling, The memorial shadows darkling Swim the wall in strange mutation, Till the marvelling contemplation Feeds its wonder to repletion With each firelight apparition. There the ashen Alp appears, And its glowing head uprears, Like a warrior grim and bold, With a helmet on of gold; And a music goes and comes Like the sound of distant drums. O'er a line of serried lances How the blazing banner dances, While red pennons rise and fall Over ancient Hannibal. Lo, beneath a moon of fire, Where the meteor sparks stream by her, There I see the brotherhood Which on sacred GrÃ¼tli stood, Pledging with crossed hands to stand The defenders of the land. And in that red ember fell Gessler, with the dart of Tell! Still they fall away, and, lo! Other phantoms come and go, Other banners wing the air,â And the countless bayonets glare, While around the steep way stir Armies of the conqueror; And the slow mule toiling on Bears the world's Napoleon. Now the transient flame that flashes 'Twixt the great logs and the ashes, Sends a voice out from the middle That my soul cannot unriddle, Till the fire above and under Gnaws the stoutest wood asunder, And the brands, in ruin blended, Smoking, lie uncomprehended,â While the dying embers blanch, And the muffled avalanche, Noiseless as the years descend, Sweeps them to an ashen end. Thus at last the great shall be, And the slave shall lie with them,â PiÃ© Jesu Domine Dona eis requiem! DRIFTING. My soul to-day Is far away, Sailing the Vesuvian Bay; My wingÃ©d boat, A bird afloat, Swims round the purple peaks remote: Round purple peaks It sails, and seeks Blue inlets and their crystal creeks, Where high rocks throw, Through deeps below, A duplicated golden glow. Far, vague, and dim, The mountains swim; While on Vesuvius' misty brim, With outstretched hands, The gray smoke stands O'erlooking the volcanic lands. In lofty lines, 'Mid palms and pines, And olives, aloes, elms, and vines, Sorrento swings On sunset wings, Where Tasso's spirit soars and sings. Here Ischia smiles O'er liquid miles; And yonder, bluest of the isles, Calm Capri waits, Her sapphire gates Beguiling to her bright estates. I heed not, if My rippling skiff Float swift or slow from cliff to cliff; With dreamful eyes My spirit lies Under the walls of Paradise. Under the walls Where swells and falls The Bay's deep breast at intervals, At peace I lie, Blown softly by, A cloud upon this liquid sky. The day, so mild, Is Heaven's own child, With Earth and Ocean reconciled;â The airs I feel Around me steal Are murmuring to the murmuring keel. Over the rail My hand I trail Within the shadow of the sail, A joy intense, The cooling sense Glides down my drowsy indolence. With dreamful eyes My spirit lies Where Summer sings and never dies: O'erveiled with vines, She glows and shines Among her future oil and wines. Her children, hid The cliffs amid, Are gambolling with the gambolling kid; Or down the walls, With tipsy calls, Laugh on the rocks like waterfalls. The fisher's child, With tresses wild, Unto the smooth, bright sand beguiled, With glowing lips Sings as she skips, Or gazes at the far-off ships. Yon deep barque goes Where Traffic blows, From lands of sun to lands of snows;â This happier one, Its course is run From lands of snow to lands of sun. O happy ship, To rise and dip, With the blue crystal at your lip! O happy crew, My heart with you Sails, and sails, and sings anew! No more, no more The worldly shore Upbraids me with its loud uproar! With dreamful eyes My spirit lies Under the walls of Paradise! THE NEW PASTORAL. INTRODUCTION. If from this oaten pipeâ Plucked from the shadow of primeval woods, And waked to changeful numbers by strange airs, Born by my native stream, in leafy depths Of unfrequented gladesâsomewhat of song Pour through its simple stops, and wake again In other hearts what I have felt in mine, Then not in vain I hold it to my lips, And breathe the fulness of my soul away. My theme, the countryâworthier theme is not In all the tomes which star the centuries, From blind MÃ¦onides to Milton blind! Oh! would that I, with all my living sight, Might see the least of what their blank orbs saw; And, seeing, wake but once their kindling note, And, unappalled, attempt their solemn bass; Then would the song behind the argument Halt at less distance. As it is, I sing Conscious of the disparity, and tremble,â As who might not? But what mine eyes have seen, Ears heard, heart felt, my muse shall teach in numbers; Not with a bondmaid's hand, but housewife's care, Who holds chaste plenty better than rich waste. And not of wars terrestrial, or of heaven, Or of a hero, whose great name, ablaze With glory, lights the annals of an era, My pipe proclaims; but of that pastoral phase, Where man is native to his sphere, which shows The simple light of nature, fresh from God!â That middle life, between the hut and palace, 'Twixt squalid ignorance and splendid vice;â Above, by many roods of moral moves, The Indian's want, and happily belowâ If the superior may be called belowâ The purple and fine linen;âthe broad plain, Where rests the base of our protecting walls, Where many labor, though but few take note, And prop the world, as pillars prop a dome. Of trial and of triumph is my song, Of maidens fair and matronhood sublime, Of iron men who build the golden future,â Heroic wills, by which the hugest oak Is broken like a sapling; and to which The wilderness, the rank and noxious swamps, Inhospitable hills, renouncing all The incumbrances of ages, bow and bear The burthen of the harvest.âThis my song. Scorn not the muse because 'mid scenes like these She loves to wander; and, with calm delight, Prefers to dwell among the rustic homes, Where sweet Content, beside the well-swept hearth, Sits like an angel, and will not depart. To this the plush and curtains of the proud, The stucco and thin gilding of the townâ In halls where Luxury, excited, sees A thousand repetitions of herself Caught into shadowy corridors, afar, Of glass in glass interminably lostâ Were cold and naked as the winter shed, Through which the snow falls filtered to the floor, Piling the cheerless drift. Let me but look On Nature through the tranquil change of dayâ The common shade and sunshineâand on life Which, unambitious, seeks no other hues To show her fair, or hide deformities. Ye who would seek for aught, beside such light And beauty as are found in summer fields,â For theories new, where splendid errors shine, And charm like sirens, while they drown the soul,â For aught of song which, covertly, dispreads The seeds which shall breed poison in the dews, And round the foot of our great sheltering Tree, Give root to vines, with odors breathing bane,â For any mystery deeper than which lies Between the bounds of human woe and bliss,â May close these harmless pages and pass on: The truths I seek lie round us in the sun. There are whom neither sun nor shade delightsâ One warming not, the other is not grateful; Who rest so deeply dungeoned in themselves, No sound can waken, and no light attract; Who lay approving hands on Nature's head, Too wise to sit, recipient, at her feet: The applause of such lies not within the pale Of my ambition. Though my song may be The transient music of a spring-time runnel, Which may not last the season through;âor though My light be only as an evening taper Placed in the casement of a hill-side home, Which, ere the midnight, in the socket dies;â Still will I hold the satisfying trust, That some there are who, in a transient brook, Can find a music which may give them joy; Or pleasure in the taper, lit at eve To send its ray aslant the peaceful vale. And yet one higher hope still lights my toil, And cheers the darkness when the lamp grows dim; And I have pledged me in the heart to fill The compass of this wish, if in me lies Strength, native and achievedâand heaven vouchsafe What else is needful, equal to the task!â Let me but place one stone within the wallâ While the stout masons, with great plumb and line, Are laying the foundations, broad and deep, Of native mind, to be a temple, and A future tower of strength,âlet me but place One stone within the wall, where worthier are, Inscribed with Poesy!âno other word! Whether the name of him who placed it there Go with it, is but little; and should be, In the just balance of true poets,ânaught! Florence, 1854. PRELUDE. A vision strode before me toward the west, What time the day let drop its golden shieldâ A giant form with sun-illumined face: His hue was like the last dull bar that falls At eve athwart the hill-tops. From his brow, A plume of many colors 'gainst the sky Blazed like a torch-flame. In his tawny hand A mighty bow he boreâso tall, its top Flamed in the sun-down, while the low extreme Trailed the dusk dews, unseen, along the vale. His eyes were deep, cavernous, unsubduedâ So deep, a curse seemed crouching in their depthâ And bent with fixed and melancholy stare; The sun a target to his arrowy sight. He took no note of where his footsteps fellâ No sound of tread, no rustle in the grass, Ran herald to his comingâall was soft And noiseless as the owlet's wing. His lips Were set in uncomplaining firmness; his right hand Grasped, as with joy, the trophies at his girdle. From his huge breast no word of sadness brokeâ Not even a sigh to startle the calm hour! And yet not voiceless was the air; small sounds, Faint murmurs, delicate whisperings and low songsâ The cadence of invisible choirs, perchance, Of aboriginal elves, which fly the haunts Of pallid Saxons as a child a ghost;â A choral sorrow, as if leaves and flowers, The sprites of wood and stream and water-fall, Were pouring out a burthen of despair, Filling the ear of twilight, rose and rose, Thrilled to the faint stars brightening overhead, And fell and fell, until the deep lake heard The shy nymphs answering from their caves forlorn. CHORUS. I. O, mighty spirit, flying, ever flying! We are the woodlandsâhearken to our wail! Our poplars trembling and our maples sighing, Our great oaks bowing, as before a gale, Our pines all sorrowing and our aspens dying, Our sycamores with terror growing pale, All mourn thy flight. Oh! turn to their embraces, Nor let the sunshine gloat upon their vacant places! II. O, mighty spirit, speeding, ever speeding!â We are the hills and valleys thou hast loved! Here rest your sires, their dead hearts freshly bleeding Beneath thy flight, while they lie unremoved! Above their shrines dull foreign herds are feeding, And glides the grating ploughshare unreproved. Oh! turn againârepel the foe's advanceâ Rebuild your midnight fires, and weave your warlike dance! III. O, mighty spirit, fading, ever fading! We are the springs and brooklets, rivers, lakes! We miss your maidensâmiss your children wading Along our sands and pebbles; and where breaks Our lightest ripple now, it dies upbraiding The lonely marge, and every fountain aches! Your light canoes lie warping on the shore, Half buried in the sand! Oh! turn to us once more! CHORUS OF ALL. O, mighty spirit, flying, ever flying! Thou wilt not stay and smile on us again: Our hopes are ashes, and our hearts are dying, Our garlands are transmuted to a chain; Our necks beneath the conquerors are lying, The toiling yoke succeeds thy peaceful reign! The clouds have ta'en thee! We have looked our last, And mournful memory now alone can bring the past. The song was ended and the shade was gone, Lost in the fiery forests of the sun. But often since, as Eve her mantle drew O'er her chaste bosom, stepping from her cave, Where all the day she nods above her urn Of dews and perfume, sentried by her owlâ The muse has watched in the departing west, 'Mid visionary landscapes, rivers, lakes, O'er purple prairies, and through golden woods, This flying shadow with his blazing bow And flashing arrows, flaming as they flew, Chasing the deer whose antlers 'mid the stars Flung up the lustre of the dying day; Or o'er the fallen bison saw him stand, His red foot glowing in its gorgeous mane. Such was the vision and its flight: and when All this had passedâthe shadow and the songâ A lovelier music to the spiritual ear Swelled through the starry air and filled the vale,â Sounds which seemed born in heaven, and poured From out the constellations in the East. Scarce sweeter were the melodies, methinks, Heard by the shepherds on far Bethlehem's plain, What time the flocks, waked by the midnight dawn, Greeting the fancied advent of the day, Arose, their fleeces dripping fresh with dew, And cropt the wet grass in the amber light Of that one star which ushered in a morn That circles all the years, and, brightening, sheds Its radiance through the ages. CHORUS OF SPIRITS. FIRST SPIRIT. I am the fairest spirit breathed from Godâ Not mine the praise, but Hisâ And where my footprints sanctify the sod There peaceful plenty is. Hail, happy land! your ancient night is throughâ Receive us and be blest! From this celestial urn of holy dew I here baptize the West! SECOND SPIRIT. I am the child of her whose voice but now Made musical the air; I bring the laurel which shall bind your brow, I come to place it there. I bring the sword so tempered in the glow Of Courage, Truth, and Right, Its keen edge severs at one steady blow The tyrant's chain of might! Unsheathed still let it gleam athwart the land, The light of peace or ire; Its flash shall be as lightning in your handâ Its stroke, a bolt of fire! I bring the buds of future centuries To bloom upon your breastâ They hold the dews of Freedomâand with these I here baptize the West! THIRD SPIRIT. I am that spirit born in Paradise, When man's first parents erred, And the deep judgment thundered from the skies The dread commanding word. I walked with them through far and thorny lands, In desert realms unknown, And taught them toil, until their tender hands Were tawny as my own. I bring the axe, the sickle, and the plough, Whose use alone gives restâ And with the dews which fell from Adam's brow I here baptize the West! FOURTH SPIRIT. I am that spirit who, in ages gone, No certain shelter found; But here, at last, I hail the peaceful dawn, And bless the sacred ground. Mine was the name the joyous angels sung, To cheer the shepherds' ear; And with that Star I into being sprung, And with that Star am here. And with this palm-branch, plucked from off the stem Of Heaven's own tree of rest, And dipped in dews which fell o'er Bethlehem, I, too, baptize the West! The chorus died; and presently the sound Of falling forests, and the woodman's blow, Of mill-wheels laboring in the stream, replied, With one loud voice, to welcome in the band: Then all was silent as befits the night. BOOK FIRST. Fair Pennsylvania! than thy midland vales, Lying 'twixt hills of green, and bound afar By billowy mountains rolling in the blue, No lovelier landscape meets the traveller's eye. There Labor sows and reaps his sure reward, And Peace and Plenty walk amid the glow And perfume of full garners. I have seen In lands less free, less fair, but far more known, The streams which flow through history and wash The legendary shores, and cleave in twain Old capitals and towns, dividing oft Great empires and estates of petty kings And princes, whose domains full many a field, Rustling with maize along our native West, Outmeasures and might put to shame! and yet Nor Rhine, inebriate reeling through his hills, Nor mighty Danube, marred with tyranny, His dull waves moaning on Hungarian shoresâ Nor rapid Po, his opaque waters pouring Athwart the fairest, fruitfullest, and worst Enslaved of European landsânor Seine, Winding uncertain through inconstant Franceâ Is half so fair as thy broad stream whose breast Is gemmed with many isles, and whose proud name Shall yet become among the names of rivers A synonyme of beautyâSusquehanna! But where, fair land, thy smaller streams invite With music among plenteous farms, I turn, As to a parent's fond embrace, and lay, Well pleased, my way-worn mantle by, and shed, With grateful heart, from off my weary feet The white dust gathered in the world's highway. Here my young muse first learned to love and dreamâ To love the simplest blossom by the roadâ To dream such dreams as will not come again. And for one hour of that unlettered timeâ One hour of that wild music in the heart, When Fancy, like the swallow's aimless wing, Flitted eccentric through all moods of natureâ I would exchange, thrice told, this weary day. Then were yon hills, still beautiful and blue, Great as the Andes; and this rushy brook, Which the light foot-board, fallen, turns aside, A torrent voluble, with noisy falls And gulfy pools profound; and yonder stream, The fisher wades with ease to throw his bait Into the larger ripple, was a river To measure Jordan by! For then my thoughts Were full of scriptural lore, oft-heard at morn, And in the evening heard, until the place Became a Palestine, while o'er the hills The blue horizon compassed all the world. Adieu to Fancy! Let me ope the gate, Wide as the lane it bars, and cool my feet Along the grassy path, and turn with joy, As erst, to yonder chapel on the hill. Lo! the calm Sabbath sanctifies the air, And over all, from God's uplifted hand, The silence falls, and like a blessing lies The stillness on my spirit. The sweet sounds, Which unprohibited from Eden time till now Have charmed alike the day of toil and rest, Alone assail the ear, making the quiet heard, Soothing the soul as with a psalm! Yon bird Which soars and falls, swinging its way through heaven On airy billows, and this brook which sings The better for the obstacles opposed. As bards have done, together with the sounds Of lesser note, which come from those small choirs In leafy chapels closed, make to the ear A music lovelier than the brazen notes Blown through the serried pillars of cathedrals. It is the Spring-time: April violets glow In wayside nooks, close clustering into groups, Like shy elves hiding from the traveller's eye; The mellow air, which from the woodland comes, Is full of perfume shed from opening buds. There the young maple, earlier putting forth, In memory of the past dead Autumn gleams, And waves its purple torch; and o'er the spring, The willow its own sprouting in the pool Hangs watching; while the dryad in its branches Is dreaming of the hours when that fair maid, The child and light of yonder cot, shall come And, kneeling, laugh above her urn to see Her sweet face wrinkled by prophetic waters. The plough in this broad field with upthrown share, There left at yester sunset, lies at rest Along the midway furrow. Here the maize Shall rustle through the summer; while near by Already the live grain, which 'neath the snow Slept the white winter through, sends up its green And whispers in the sunshine. Lo! anon, From hill-side homes and hamlets in the vale, One after one, in Sabbath garb arrayed, Their mantles breathing of deep oaken drawers And antique chests, the people throng, and take The various pathways which converging lead Here to this quiet shrine among the elms. Oh, happy hour, beloved of peace and heaven! Around and over all, the white calm lies Flooded with perfume and mysterious light; So sweet, so beautiful, it seems a day Lost out of Eden! See, where children come, Like hopes unchecked, still running in advance, With innocent laughter, but not over loud, Plucking the purple violets by the way; While from their feet the butterfly, released But yesterday from out his winter cell, Darts up with devious flight, and, like a wisp, Wavers across the meadow! Happy sounds, By happier faces followed, still approach. What round and ruddy cheeks are there, to which Health, like the sun, with daily welcome comes, Leaving the impress of his glowing hand! But suddenly their tongues to whispers low Drop, as their eyes look wondering on the stranger, And into decorous columns, two by two, They file before me with shy glances cast From shadowy brims and snowy hoods turned back, By matron care arranged. Some in their hands Bear the small volumeâbook of praise or prayer; And some with freedom-loving feet released Printing the dusty path, their little shoes, For Sunday polished, carry at the side, To be resumed at yonder stile which gains The highway near the church. And, following, soon The larger people come; the youths and maids Joining their steps as chance or fancy leads; And, after these, stout men with faces brown, And browner hands which on the plough-helves took, Ungloved, the last week's sunshine. At their side The matrons with fair brows but half-way cleared Of household cares, which, oft accomplished, still As oft recur, monotonous, only cheered By virtuous sense of duty and the light Of happy children, or encouraging words Heard at the well-served meal; or, better still, Finding approval in their own calm hearts, Whose gentle tempers round their daily toil Shed music and a halo else unknown. Here following still, with reverend steps and slow, Their garments venerable with age, and out Of joint with modern custom, come the sires And mothers of the country, silver-haired. One leans upon his cane, with knotted hands, An oak long bowed and gnarled by tempests; one Stands upright as a winter pine. To-day He comes not in his long surtout of drabâ The coat of many capes and sweeping skirt, Brushing the stubble, proof to winds rheumaticâ Now laid aside until November calls, But in the spring-time garments of the past. See what a brow is there, where Time delights To place the warning record of the years! Note the calm eye, grown mild with light of wisdom! Assisted by his arm, his partner, bowed, Walks tottering, with a palsy-shaken head, And mumbling to herself. Perchance she dreams, Within her hazy brain, of that bright hour, Now buried beneath half a century, When on that self-same arm she proudly leaned, And, with the blush of youth upon her cheek, Crossed this same pasture, and, returning, heard And answered to another name. Her hopes Of earth have all been realizedâher dreams Have, one by one, gone floating down the past, Like bubbles in the sun, where envious years Have touched them into nothing, and now point Derision at the empty places. Thus Full many a heart grows old, and spirit bowed, In intellectual wantâa poverty Scarce second to the need of bread! For what, When all the joys which stir our inward life, And wake a pleasure in the blood, are dead Or dying at their sources, can renew Long-past enjoyment, like the power of thought Drawn from a wisdom gleaned in fields of knowledge? And many a life, before its time, thus wilts And withers to the root, and to each wind, Adverse or fair, rustles its sad complaint, Which else should sway with music. They should store, Like bees in summer, for their winter want, Nor leave improvidence to clip their wings. Not so the form she leans on: unto him Each sight and sound of Nature is a page Full of fresh thought and pleasing contemplation. A man not deep in books, but in research, Among the hidden lore which round him lies Most practical; and all the neighborhood Holds him an oracle, and reverence pays, As well they may; for he, within these bounds, Has held the keys of knowledge many a year, Teaching in yonder rude house in the grove. All these are of his scholarsâfirst to last Have laid their little books upon his knee, And stumbled through their lessons undismayed, Guided with kindness; and in every heart Is Master Ethan filially remembered. His son, a man of mild and easy moodâ A nature far more gentle than befits One who must struggle with a stubborn soilâ Walks hearkening to his sire's discourse. And next, Lo, the staid matron, with emphatic step, Whose every movement speaks her stately soulâ The undaunted mistress of her narrow realm, With all th' amenities which goodness givesâ A woman fit for heroes to call mother! With form less tall and full, the daughter comes, Her blonde hair waving round her gentle browâ A face to be remembered, and, methinks, Not easily forgotten; for that eye, So deep and blue, where starry truth abides, As in the fabled well, once on your own Falling, with its miraculous pure light, Stays not upon the face, but to the heart Looks in, as through a casement, and the soul Then feels as if an angel, going by, Had glanced within, and left its smile in passing! And should your feet e'er wander to these vales, The farms of Hazel-meadow, many a tongue This picture shall attest, and, as they speak, Mark if the sigh comes not with confirmation. For there are hearts to which that face hath grown A part and a necessity, as grows A child unto the sunshine of a household; And oft the neighboring groves shall hear her name, As some lone peasant takes his woodland way, Recalling the bright summers of the past. âOlivia!â they'll sigh, with slackened pace, And all the leaves reply, âOlivia!â Yet unattended by the swains gallant, Nor yet free mingling with the joyous groups Of neighbor-maidens, from her childhood known, She keeps her Sabbath way; still cheerful, though Her eyes are now more kin to tears than smiles. Nor are cold glances, sidelong looks unkind, And jealous hate, accusing her of pride, From former playmates cast upon her now; But words all gentleness, and eyes all love, Meet her where'er she turns, which kindly say, If not in language, in each tone and act, âWe know, dear friend, the secret which you keep, And whence the fountain of that springing tear The smile not wholly hides. We know the pain Which cankers at that rose upon your cheek. We also grieve the absence which you grieve, And mourn the distance 'twixt his heart and ours, And pray for his return. Ships come and go, The sea gives up its living, day by day, And presently our Arthur shall return, Full of brave life and wisdomâshall return, Glowing with noble thoughts and filled with hope, The promise of great actions. Then, beneath The summer shade, or by the blazing hearth, His voice shall cheer the noonday or the eve, Recounting, with accustomed eloquence, Rare tales of travel, intermixed with song.â Such is the comfort in each look and word Which soothes awhile her fancy, but not long; For absence is a shadow which no light Can utterly dispelâa prison door, Before the spirit, made of grated bars, Through which the brightest day can only send A checkered sunshine. Here next, following, come The happy members of the parson's household; And last, with thoughtful care conning, perchance, The plain, unwritten sermon of the day, The parson walks, a man of fifty years, Who half his life has labored in this field, Baptizing, marrying,âand burying oft Where death had put asunder. His broad brow The quiet storehouse is of wisdom, learned From open nature, and vouchsafed from God. All week he tends within his noisy mill, There are those who, perhaps, will be struck with the novelty of a man devoting his Sabbaths to the pulpit, and his weekdays to an occupation which would seem to allow him but little time for study and meditation; but, if they knew our rural districts better, they would probably call to mind many originals of the picture which I have attempted to draw. The âlocal preacher,â I believe, not only receives no salary, but is generally one of the first persons called upon in cases of charity. It is with no intention to disparage the ministerial profession that this character is drawn: on the contrary, no one can hold in higher esteem than I do, that valorous army of ill-rewarded men who nobly sacrifice all worldly considerations for the amelioration of their fellows. Whose wheel now hangs and dreams o'er yonder stream, And bends his brawny shoulders to the sacks Which daily cross the threshold; or among The ceaseless jar and whir of rumbling stones, And clattering hoppers, garrulous with grain, He walks amid the misty meal, and plans The solemn lesson for the coming Sabbath His heart is full of boundless sympathies: The stranger and the friend, the erring or The good, come not within his genial voice Or smile, but they go hence with firm resolve For happy change, or strengthened in the right. The old or young, departing, bear away The influence of his spirit in their hearts, E'en as they bear the mill-dust on their garments. The sire of Arthur he, the youth who now Wanders in foreign lands, by romance led, Bearing the hearts and hopes of many hence; But chiefly hers, long deemed by all his choice. By various ways the people still come in: Here on the hill-side path, with swinging arms, Weaving the air with visionary shuttles, Gaunt Bowman mounts, ascending as on treadlesâ Bowman, chief weaver of the vale; his wife Close following, like himself, arrayed in suit Of home-made russet. Down the dusty road The vehicles, of various forms, approach: The rattling wagon, out of joint and loose, With temporary seats, and difficult For unaccustomed riders; and the chaise With rocking motion, easy as a chair, Drawn by a jogging steed whose shoulders still Feel the fresh record of the yester plough. Some, rudely mounted as equestrians, come; The switch held upward, like a sword; the horse, With swinging head, blowing the foam in air: And here, anon, the family steed is seen, Bearing a double burthen with slow pace. How all the landscape, with the Sabbath scene, Smiles with a bland and staid propriety! About the chapel door, in easy groups, The rustic people wait. Some trim the switch, While some prognosticate of harvests full, Or shake the dubious head, with arguments Based on the winter's frequent snow and thaw, The heavy rains, and sudden frosts severe. Some, happily but few, deal scandal out, With look askance pointing their victim. These Are the rank tares in every field of grainâ These are the nettles stinging unawareâ The briers which wound and trip unheeding feetâ The noxious vines, growing in every grove! Their touch is deadly, and their passing breath Poison most venomous! Such have I knownâ As who has not?âand suffered by the contact. Of these the husbandman takes certain note, And in the proper season disinters Their baneful roots; and, to the sun exposed, The killing light of truth, leaves them to pine And perish in the noonday! 'Gainst a tree, With strong arms folded o'er a giant chest, Stands Barton, to the neighborhood chief smith; His coat, unused to aught save Sunday wear, Grown too oppressive by the morning walk, Hangs on the drooping branch: so stands he oft Beside the open door, what time the share Is whitening at the roaring bellows' mouth. There, too, the wheelwrightâhe, the magistrateâ In small communities a man of markâ Stands with the smith, and holds such argument As the unlettered but observing can; Their theme some knot of Scripture hard to solve. And 'gainst the neighboring bars two others fan, Less fit the sacred hour, discussion hot Of politics; a topic which, inflamed, Knows no propriety of time or place. There Oakes, the cooper, with rough brawny hand, Descants at large, and, with a noisy ardor, Rattles around his theme as round a cask; While Hanson, heavy-browed, with shoulders bent, Bent with great lifting of huge stonesâfor he A mason and famed builder isâreplies With tongue as sharp and dexterous as his trowel, And sentences which like his hammer fall, Bringing the flinty fire at every blow! But soon the approaching parson ends in peace The wordy combat, and all turn within. Awhile rough shoes, some with discordant creak, And voices clearing for the psalm, disturb The sacred quiet, till, at last, the veil Of silence wavers, settles, falls; and then The hymn is given, and all arise and sing. Then follows prayer, which from the pastor's heart Flows unpretending, with few words devout Of humble thanks and askings; not, with lungs Stentorian, assaulting heaven's high wall, Compelling grace by virtue of a siege! This done, with loving care he scans his flock, And opes the sacred volume at the text. Wide is his brow, and full of honest thoughtâ Love his vocation, truth is all his stock. With these he strives to guide, and not perplex With words sublime and empty, ringing oft Most musically hollow All his facts Are simple, broad, sufficient for a world! He knows them well, teaching but what he knows. He never strides through metaphysic mists, Or takes false greatness because seen through fogs; Nor leads 'mid brambles of thick argument Till all admire the wit which brings them through; Nor e'er essays, in sermon or in prayer, To share the hearer's thought; nor strives to make The smallest of his congregation lose One glimpse of heaven, to cast it on the priest. Such simple course, in these ambitious times, Were worthy imitation; in these days, When brazen tinsel bears the palm from worth, And trick and pertness take the sacred desk; Or some coarse thund'rer, armed with doctrines new, Aims at our faith a blow to fell an oxâ Swinging his sledge, regardless where it strikes, Or what demolishesâwell pleased to win By either blows or noise!âA modern seer, Crying destruction! and, to prove it true, Walking abroad, for demolition armed, And boldly levelling where he cannot build! The service done, the congregation rise, And with a freshness glowing in their hearts, And quiet strength, the benison of prayer, And wholesome admonition, hence depart. Some, loath to go, within the graveyard loiter, Walking among the mounds, or on the tombs Hanging, like pictured grief beneath a willow, Bathing the inscriptions with their tears; or here, Finding the earliest violet, like a drop Of heaven's anointing blue upon the dead. Bless it with mournful pleasure; or, perchance, With careful hands, recall the wandering vine, And teach it where to creep, and where to bear Its future epitaph of flowers. And there, Each with a separate grief, and some with tears, Ponder the sculptured lines of consolation. âThe chrysalis is hereâthe soul is flown, And waits thee in the gardens of the blest!â âThe nest is cold and empty, but the bird Sings with its loving mates in Paradise!â âOur hope was planted hereâit blooms in heaven!â âShe walks the azure field, 'mid dews of bliss, While 'mong the thorns our feet still bleed in this!â âThis was the fountain, but the sands are dryâ The waters have exhaled into the sky!â âThe listening Shepherd heard a voice forlorn, And found the lamb, by thorns and brambles torn, And placed it in his breast! Then wherefore mourn?â Such are the various lines; and, while they read, Methinks I hear sweet voices in the air, And winnowing of soft, invisible wings, The whispering of angels breathing peace! BOOK SECOND. Where now Olivia, joined by her one friend And confidante, Amy, the wheelwright's daughter, Turns from the church, a youth from yonder town, The village of the vale, the postman's son, With courteous greeting, unobserved bestows A missive blurred with foreign stamps, through which The ciphers of her name are dimly seen. Swift darts the flush across her cheek and brow; Her brain is reeling with the sudden joy; She clasps the letter as 'twere Arthur's hand, Then slips it in her bosom, where it hears The impatient fluttering of her happy heart. Both silently pursue their homeward walk, With arm affectionate at each other's waist. No lovelier picture e'er shall bless the vale Than those two maidens strolling down the fields, Their faces beautiful with various thoughts; One lost 'mid visions rising in her soul, Until her eyes grow dreamy with love's dew; The other, with warm pressure of the arm, And tender looks, pronouncing sympathy! Their pleasing pathway leads by yonder grove; But scarce their footsteps skirt the silent wood, When Amy, with a shudder, checks her pace; Olivia recoils, and both stand still! Lo! the weird dame of Oakland stops their path! A beldame, bowed, bearing a bunch of sticks To light her evening fire. Her shreds of hair Floating in snowy wisps beneath her hood, The toothless visage, shrivelled, pinched, and cramped By years which wellnigh span a century's gap, Make her, to youthful eyes, a sight uncouth; And even the whisper of her name oft sends An ugly phantom to the urchin's pillow, Smoothing his wry face in the covers hid. Her voice is like the creak of withered boughs! And, with a smile across her frosty face, She summons the half-timid maids approach. Lo! there the living allegory stands Of Winter beckoning to young May and June! âHey-day! fair lasses, I've a word for you!â She cries, and holds her shrivelled finger up. âCan you tell why the bluebird, on yon branch, Is singing so? Ah, silly hearts, to say It sings for simple pleasure! Know you why This brook, which through your fathers' meadows flows, Makes such sweet music and so swiftly runs? Ah, no; you have not pondered on it well. The bluebird is a young man's heart, forsooth; The brook, the heedless fancies of a maiden. One sings, with all its art, to win a mate; The other hurries, without knowing why, Until it meets the river. Thereâgo! go! And when your sweethearts next shall clasp your hands, Ask them, in autumn, whither fly the birds?â If they depart in singing pairs together? And tell them how the winter shall come in, And choke the brook with ice till it is dumb! Yet, stay! you are, I see, the wheelwright's daughter. What doth he with the chips about his door, That a poor soul is not allowed to have A shaving but to light her fagots with? Who grudgeth splinters may, himself, want logs; Who gives no drink may have his well go dry! The kind man's wheat is seldom trampled down, Nor oft his fence-rails feed the poor man's oven; His herds come home, not worried by the dogs; His horse, astray, is not put into pound! When you are married, teach your husband this, If you would have him thrive. But, mark you, first, Beware the brightness of your coal-black eye, For it may fascinate to your own harm! I have a parable for you: A little bird there was would sing, Would sing with all its throat, And sang so loud that every wing Came hurrying to the note. A sailing hawk, among the rest, On spotted pinions came, And floated east, and floated west, Still circling near his game, Until she fancied every breast Must feel an envious flame! His eye was on the silly bird, It made her heart rejoice; She thought, too true, the great hawk heard, With deep delight, her voice. And, nearer still, she saw him stoop, On wheeling pinions gayâ The noblest wing, of all the troop, She fancied his that dayâ Till, with one sudden, cruel swoop, He bore her far away! Your sky now shines as bright as this o'erhead, But I can see, as over yon blue hills, The white clouds rising which, before the night, Shall fill the land with thunder and with rain.â Thus speaking with a frown, she clears her brow And to the other turns:ââAnd you, I see, Are daughter to good neighbor Baldwin here. You have a loverâay, I know it wellâ I rocked his cradle when he was a child, And promised him a sweetheart fair and kind; And as I said a sweetheart, how he laughed, And clapped his dimpled hands, as if the word He could not comprehend, had music in't. And then, upon the day that you were born, I took you, in your little robes of white, And, on a pillow, bore you to the window. âSee there,â said I, âyour sweetheart, in the field, Is chasing butterflies among the clover!â And then you smiled. It may be fancy, still, Methought, I saw you smile as you smile now! Come to my cot, anon, if you would know The mystery of the futureâwhen the moon Is in the crescent, come! And mark you well To view her o'er the shoulder on the right; For she is jealous, and, viewed otherwise, Can work you direful mischief. When you plant, Either your hopes or flowers, oh! then beware! Consult her pleasure, and look out the signs, Else will they bear you thorns, and never roses, And tear the hand which planted! Call me witch, Or what you will; but only this remember, When evil I predict, bewareâbeware!â Thus saying, she adjusts her twisted load Of gnarlÃ©d sticks, and turns into the grove, Shaking her warning finger as she goes. âNay, Amy dear, mind not the snarling dame!â Speaks mild Olivia, comforting her friend;â âHer brain is far more crooked than her body; Her temper is as crabbed as a thorn, Which, when an ill wind blows, can only chafe And worry its own branches! Mind her not! 'Tis evident she holds a harmless grudge. Poor soul! I needs must pity herâso old, And so forlornâshe must be miserable!â To which the other answers, with a shudder, âSome say she is a witch, and can work harm, Send sickness 'mong the cattle, and brew storms!â âMere superstition!â cries her friend. â'Tis wrong, 'Tis sinful, to hold such belief of one Whom God has made, even as he has us! The height of her pretence is but to tell The fortune, from the hand, as many do, Which hath no further harm in it than this, That some there are, who, foolishly, have faith, And wait her promises, with hope or dread. Why, I, myself, will turn a cup, and read The accidental figures in the grounds, And thereby, with shrewd guesses, tell the future; And yet I am no witch! I pity her: And I have heard my grandsire often say, There was a time when she was young and fair, And light of heart, as either you or I; And how she was betrothed, and how the war Left her as friendless as we see her now. Supposeâbut, no, we will not think of that; But let us pity the poor crone, and pray, When we grow old, we may not be like her.â Thus saying, they approach diverging paths, And, after sweet adieus, take separate ways. BOOK THIRD. How, o'er the silent fields, the white heat gloats And shimmers like a silver swarm! Anon, A distant rumbling shudders through the air, Shed from those domes of thunder in the west, Which swell and rise, and, brightening, as they swell, Show the black walls beneath, from out whose ports The flash shall lighten and the rain be poured! The warning given, the various stragglers hear, And note it well, and hasten to their homes. Olivia, now, hath crossed her native porch, Where, earlier arrived, the family sit. There, unappalled by unmolesting friends, The russet wren glides in among the vines, And adds another strand unto its nest, Then, on the neighboring trellis, pours its song. The poor man's cottage is its favorite haunt; And he is poor, indeed, who to his roof Can welcome not the yearly visitor, To cheer his door with music! There, too, comes, But less to be desired, the boring bee, Blowing his warning horn, and in the wood Mining his secret galleries secure. A carpenter is he who for himself Builds, and destroys for others; while the dust Of his incessant saw upon the floor Demands the busy broom. Some on the face Wear the white badge of innocence, and these Fall frequent captives to the boy who frights The smaller children with the stingless shape. The wayward swallows flicker through the air, Or, safely sheltered 'neath the mossy eaves, Sit chattering scandal at their clay-built doors; While others, with a taste for soot and smoke, Dart down the chimney, with a muffled noise, Echoing the distant thunder. For these sounds Olivia hath no ear, nor any eye For aught save that dear page o'er which she pores, Reading it with her heart as with her sight! Secure from all intrusion, there she sits Beside her chamber-window. O'er the sill The creeping vine looks in, and on her brow, Flushed with delight, the passing air is shed Fresh with the perfume of the coming rain; And ere she is aware the darkness falls, Deeper than twilight, and the first big drops Rattle like pebbles on the sultry shingles, And splash the window-ledge. Then bursts the shower, And roars along the roof. The while, outside, The house-top smokes with the rebounding spray; The troughs with fulness, choke and overrun; And noisy water, streaming from the eaves, Deepens the furrows in the earth beneath. Or, if the shower abates a breathing-spell, The crooked flash blinds the calm instant, when The sudden thunder stamps upon the storm, And fiercer, fuller, louder than before, The drowning deluge pours, and frights the house To silence and to wonder. Still she reads, And thus the tenor of the letter runs:â âThe lands which I most wished to tread, The scenes which I most wished to see, The shrines of the immortal dead Have known me, and I now am free. âThere is no chain the tyrant makes So strong as that of young Desire, No chord the siren Music wakes So sweet as Fancy's pilgrim lyre. âI've traced the chain which led me on, And saw it fall, like links of sand, And followed till the charm was gone From Fancy's harp-awaking hand. âIf for myself I lived alone, If there was no fond heart to greet With love the fulness of my own, I here could deem my life complete. âDesire achieved is pleasure lostâ Hope dies when cold possession comesâ And Memory poorly pays the cost With her exact and formal sums.â Thus far she reads, and with a tremor stops. A tear is on the pageâone mournful tearâ As it would blot the last sad verse away. Who tells me Love is blind? Oh, say not so! He is an Argus in the soul which sits And watches with an hundred tireless eyesâ A diligent recorder of each act And word is he. The steward of his house Sleeps not in indolence beside the wine, Or squanders among strangers, unrebuked, The master's wealth! And still Olivia reads:â âIf I have said, a hope achieved Is something lost, oh! do not frown; Nor let your gentle mind be grieved That love when won is pleasure flown. âFor, in my inmost heart, I hold Our love was never here begun; But, old as our two souls are old, It dates more cycles than the sun. âThat somewhere, in God's outer space, Our spirits had together birth, With kindred ties, no time or place Can utterly destroy on earth. âThen since our love was never won, And cannot wilt in sun or frost, Still let me sing, as I have doneâ âDesire achieved is pleasure lost!ââ Her heart, rebuked, is touched to tenderness, And through the starry light of swimming tears, Too happy to be shed, she reads again:â âThy brightness so encircles me I cannot reach its bounds, What though my footsteps daily trace The paths of foreign grounds? âI walk in an unbroken dream Of thy remembered light, A moving dome it glows by day, A sheltering arch by night! My waking hours in peace are spentâ I sleep as in a guarded tent!â Oh, love, thrice happy love, that thus can make A day of darkness, and, at noontime, shed A light which gilds the sunshine! Naught she hears, Nor sees the swelling freshet in the vale, The stream, a roaring torrent, bearing down Dead limbs and fallen trees, and in its wrath Leaving the meadows fenceless, and, anon, Robbing the woodman of his winter cords. Still, as the rain assaults the roof, she reads:â âI see Italia, with her spires and domes, Her pinnacled cathedrals and her towers, Her castles, and gray ruins, and the homes Of splendid infamy in princely bowers! Here Sin and Shame together herd, like gnomes Mining in secret, and here Hunger cowers, And squalid Want before the palace waits, And stays the stranger passing at the gates! âWhere Art, of all the good which hath been, lives, Holding decaying state, half imbecile, Like Tyranny, and now no more receives The aid of genius, but with fading smile Lives on the past; or, if a new hand givesâ As Allston and Thorwaldsen gave erewhileâ An impulse to her old triumphal ear, It is not native here, but comes from far! âWhere once the North, in swift destruction skilled, Trampled the arts to ruin, now, behold, Across the Alps it comes again to build; And the New World, with reverence for the Old, Sends her few sons, with native ardor filled, Lending new life where all is dead and cold. The Tuscan capital and haughty Rome Grow prouder while they hold our sculptor's home. âBut all these glorious galaxies of artâ This antique worldâthis garden of the pastâ Not long can bid the dream of home depart. The marble Venus hath a charm to last With those alone who wear a wandering heart. Beside the Apollo, watching where is cast His long-gone arrow, oft I stand and see Its far flight ever guiding back to thee. âOh for one hour along the quiet lane Which leads between the school and thy dear home, To breathe those tender April vows again! Or by the stream, or through the woods to roam, As we were wont when summer held her reign, Conversing love, though from our lips might come No sound of words! Oh, sighing hearts, give o'er, Ye yet shall sing together as of yore!â The page is finished, and a sudden glow, Sent from an iris towering in the east, Sheds o'er her face its lustre, till she sees And blesses the bright bow, as happy sign And confirmation of her lover's words! BOOK FOURTH. The storm is past; but still the torrent roars, Louder and louder, with incessant swell. The brook, near by, hath overswept its bounds, Drowning its tallest rushes; and the board Which made the path continuous to the schoolâ And where the children loitered to behold The minnows playingânow is borne afar, Sweeping above the bowing hazel tops. Within the opening west, the careful sunâ Like one who throws his mansion doors apart, And looks abroad, to scan his wide estateâ Is forth to note the progress of the storm, And what its rage hath wrought. Afar and near, The clouds are all ablaze with amber light; The earth receives it, and the fields look glad; And still the rainbow, brightening as it grows, Rises and bends, and makes the perfect arch. All crowd the porch, and wonder at the flood, With various surmises and alarms; And Master Ethan takes his hat and cane, (âPilgrim,â he calls the cane, for it hath been Through many generations handed down, Since first some long-gone ancestor had found The straight stem growing in an English grove And gave the ivory top,) âPilgrimâ he takes, And strides across the vale. Not winding round By easy paths, but with a course direct, O'er fences and ploughed fields, to younger feet Forbidding, bends his steps, and gains the mill; And lo! the sad fulfilment of his fears! The dam has burst! and, with a roar of triumph, The freshet mocks the miller as it flies. There stands the parson, there his good wife stands, Surrounded by their children, and with words Of wonder and of comfort Ethan comes. The miller takes his sympathizing hand, And in reply makes answer with a sighâ âHe rules the storm, the floods are in His hold, He gives and takes, and doeth all things well!â The sun goes down; the day departs in peace; And through the vale the starry tapers gleam, Signals of household calm, from cottage homes; And here and there, perchance, the slender ray Conducts the venturous feet of rustic swain, Who seeks the fireside where the maiden sits Expectant of his step and welcome knock. Not thus Olivia waits; but even thus, Beside the wheelwright's evening-lighted hearth, Her gentle friend, with an uneasy breast, Holds anxious quiet till her lover comes. Not long she waits, but, with a fluttering heart, Hears his approach, and welcomes him with smiles And maiden blush discreet. The well-pleased sire Takes, with rough grasp, the youth's smooth hand in his, And points the place of honor by the fire. The matron, with misgivings in her mind, Bends the cold nod, and, bustling for a while About her household cares, withdraws in doubt, Shaking her dubious head. Not so the squire: He sits and lights his pipe, in social mood, Which, oft as jovial converse lets go out, As oft the glowing ember reillumes. At last, with easy tapping at the jamb, The ashes fall; the pipe is laid aside, And he departs, and leaves the room to loveâ To happy whisperings, breathing words so low That naught is heard except the cricket's song, In chorus with the simmering of the log And muttering flame, which hath a voice prophetic. Oh, Muse, forbear! Although 'mid scenes like this, Thy wont is ever to draw softly near, And sit eavesdropping at the door of Love! Forbear, forbear! and be no record kept, Except within the pages of their hearts, For Time hereafter to peruse with joy, Or Grief to blot with tears. Or if to note Thou needs must lend thine ear, approach, invade The sanctuary, by intruding feet Seldom assailedâchief bedroom of the houseâ And say the tenor of the long dispute. âHe is no choice of mine,â so speaks the spouse. To which the squire demands, with testy words, âA reason, wife, a reason?âwithout that Your talk is but an idle wind, to which My set conviction is no weathervane.â âWell, call it but a wind,â the wife replies; âBut 'tis a wind which runs before the storm, And tells which way the bitter cloud is coming. And as for reason, it is quite enough My heart mislikes him, and I never found My instincts wrong. Besides, you know the dream I told you of.â To which the husband answers, With growing tartness, âWindâheartâinstinctâdream! A woman's reason truly! Now hear mine: The youth is comely, and our daughter loves him, And, fresh returned from college, is well bred, With so much learning that the neighborhood Looks on him wondering, and the loutish swains Eye him with jealousy. Who, more than I, Should know the advantage of a well-stored mind? Hence am I magistrate; and he may be, As he is like to be, the people's choice, And take his seat in Congress. Then remark What honor follows, which must e'en reach us.â To which the wifeââWere he the Governor, I would not bate a jot what I have said. Where goes my liking not, I ask no honor. He is no choice of mine. You may despise The dream I told you; but I say his eye Is just the eye that glittered in the snake; So like that, when he looks at me, I shudder, And chiefly when he smiles. And he wears ringsâ I like not thatâthe snake was also ringed.â âTush, woman!â cries the squire, interrupting; âLook Reason in the face, and put to blush Your childish superstition! Answer this: Who hath the largest farm in all the State? Who the best cattle? Who the fullest purse? And is not this his heir?â The spouse replies, With bitterness which gives each sentence strength: âHow was the farm procured? Bit after bit, By cunning tricks of law. If each had theirsâ The poor man, and the widow, and the orphanâ Those cattle would go home to different stalls. Case after case hath come to you for trial; And you should knowâfor it hath oft been said, Oft been a taunt our children heard at schoolâ That you gave favor 'gainst the poor man's cause. Oh, Walters, many a time as I have heard Some neighbor here recount to you his wrongs, My heart has ached, and indignation flamed, Until I wished that, in your icy stead, I might sit there and hold the whip of Justice! He, too, is maker of that poison drug Which blights the land with poverty and woe. His still-house knows no rest, by day or night, Until one needs must think a demon tends it. Oh, he hath much to answer for, and grows More fat in sin than body! E'en the swine He yearly bloats for slaughter at his troughs Roll in less ugliness than he to me.â The husband, angered, scarce can find reply; He feels the truth, but will not leave his point; His judgment, like a wayward child rebuked, Grows sullen and determined in the wrong, But presently responds:ââWell, say no more; When weds the maid, the maid shall have her choice. And if it be this youthâso let it be.â To which the wife makes answer with resolve: âI shall forbid, and if against my voice, Encouraged on by you, the girl shall go, Then be what mischief follows at your doorâ I'll none of it.â The voices cease; and now The stars of midnight glimmer o'er the vale; The wheelwright's gate swings in the silent dark, And one lone rider occupies the road. BOOK FIFTH. The lamp, renewed, still sheds a cheerful light, Hope lends a halo to its steady blaze; And through the casement beam the westward stars, Taking their noiseless way, and shining still, Though sleeps the world and there are few to note. And thus, encouraged by example high, The Muse awakes her simple theme and sings, And breathes, in the attentive ear of night, The song to-morrow may refuse to hear. When comes the tumult of the noisy day, And the great city, like a cataract, swells, Pouring its drowning tide of toil and trade; Not Pan's own pipe might bid it turn and hark, And, hearkening, be refreshed, much less the tune Floating unskilful from these rustic stops. Oh, thou To-morrow! wherefore wilt thou rise, And shake the quiet from thy garment's fold, E'en as a lion shakes the dream of peace From out his mane, and springs upon his prey? As on the Sabbath, birds and brooks will sing, The flowers come forth, and gentle airs shall breathe. Laden with perfume; yet wilt thou go forth, Girded with love of transient gain and power As if the world of beauty and of song Behind the gates of yesterday lay closed! Oh, rapid Age, where tends thy noisy course? Thy roaring wheels affright me, and I shrinkâ Shrink to the wayside hedge, and stand appalled; And, 'mid the smoke and discord, blindly ask The question none will spare the time to answer! Where tends thy course? To that white mart of Peace Where Wisdom, on the perfect throne of Knowledge, Reigns absolute, and Justice, loving all, And by all loved, hath dropped her useless scales? Or to the realm of Discord, where the walls, For their stupendous height, shall one day fall, With louder ruin, round the homes of men; And this huge tower aspiring to the heavens, Which Science daily rears, be stayed at last With multitudinous jargon of wild tongues? Vain question, where no voice will make reply. Time only answers in the distant future, So far his words faint in the midway air, Or come in broken murmurs, like the sea's, Dying uncomprehended. Still my soul Holds faith in man, and in his progress faith; Since not alone 'tis his, but God's. Day dawns, And with it swell the sounds, afar and near, Of lowing cattle and the crowing cocks. From farm to farm the wakening signals run, And the blue smoke ascends. The sheep, released, Leap the low bars and, following their bell, Go bleating to the pasture. And, anon, The ploughman drives his team into the field, And treads the furrow till the horn recalls. Meanwhile the kine their generous udders yield, And fill the sounding pail, till it o'erruns, And drips the path with foam. Then, at the spring, The snowy liquid poured in careful rows, And on the watery slabs arranged to cool, Gleams like a series of full moons. Afar The giant forge, at labor 'mid the hills, Throbs sullen thunder from its iron heart, And 'neath yon poplar, bursting into bloom, The lesser anvil rings. While from the cot Which on the breezy upland greets the east, The windows blazing with the morning red, The loom makes answer with its busy beat. Look in to-day upon the murmuring school. There sits the old man at his wonted desk, Round which the scholars stand in crescent rows, Class after class, the oldest coming first; Then, gradually descending, till the child In russet slip comes tottering to his feet, And finds a place upon the knee of Age, Where dimpled fingers point the letters wrong, Or stray unchided to the master's watch-seals. How like a hive, the busy school-house hums! Till comes the hour of recess, when in streams, With laughter loud, they pour into the air, And join in various games Two desks there are, Which hold for all especial charms; and oft The smiling children mark them out, and point On one the deep-carved âO.â Six times the Spring Hath breathed its odors round the sacred place, Since here the boy engraved the charmed cipher; And yearly the tradition is passed down, âThere sat Olivia, and here Arthur sat.â Now bloom the orchards, and the noisy bees Sing like a wind among the snowy boughs. The occupants of neighboring garden hives Are there, in full communities, to mine The odorous Eldorado; and the wasp Dropping his long legs, like a flying crane, Lights on the flower, and, with his ready sting, Threats the intruder. There the humble-bee Comes booming, and departs with laden thighs. The yellow-jacket, small and full of spite, Bedecked in livery of golden lace, Comes with the fretful arrogance of one Who plays the master, though himself a slave; And over all, the tyrant of the hour, The kingbird, hovers, darting on his prey; And takes the ventured argosy of sweets, Since this passage was written, the supposed fact has become a disputed question. I shall be glad to find that I have done this little marauder injustice. Then boasts his conquest on the adjacent branch, Where, like a pirate hauled against the wind, He waits another sail. From limb to limb, The birds which here delight to build their nestsâ The bluebird, and the robin, and the small Gray woodpeckerânow flit among the flowers, Until the air is full of life and song, As it is full of perfume. Now begins The housewife's happiest season of the year. The ground already broken by the spadeâ The beds made level by the passing rakeâ The almanac consulted, and the signs Conspiring favorâforth with apron full Of choicest seeds, the best which last year gave, She sallies to the garden, where, all day. Breathing the pleasant odor of the mould, She bends and plants, while, to her eye of hope, Here springs the early pea, and there the bean, The lettuce and the radish, and what else Her culinary providence requires. But chief of all, with careful hands, she sets The slips, and bulbs, and seeds which, round each bed, Shall make a bright embroidery of flowers. Thus the dame Baldwin in her garden bends. Meanwhile, Olivia by the mellow air, Her winter task of flax not wholly spun, Is wooed unto the porch, where at her wheel, Where sat her grandam generations since, She sits and sings, not loud, but low, until The little wren to listen stops his song, And wonders on the woodbine. Thus she sings:â âA damsel dwelt in a mansion old, Her eyes were blue, her hair was blonde; The hills were bright, the sky was gold, Where rose the flaming sun beyond. âThe red stream of the rising day Set all her windows east aglow, And on her face the morning ray Still stole, as it were loath to go. âAnd there she spun the silver flax, But guessed not what the woof would be, While, through her hands of snowy wax, The white thread ran incessantly. âAs fair as any queen, in sooth, She toiled and held a noble trust; Her heart had whispered this one truthâ What work would brighten, sloth would rust. ââThere is a loom,â she said, âreceives Whatever skeins my reel shall bear; There is a weaver, daily weaves The woof which I, perforce, must wear. ââAnd be the thread or coarse or fine, The loom is still the sure receiver; Whate'er I spin, the same is mine, Returned in full from Time the weaver!ââ BOOK SIXTH. Along the roads, with busy pick and spade, The neighbors gather, and, in cheerful groups, Repair the way. Some hold the heavy plough, Which grates and scours along the sandy side, Or from the rock rebounds, with sudden jerk, Or, caught beneath the deep-laid elm-root, stalls. Some fill the gullies which the winter made, And with broad shovels smooth the gravelly ground; And all, with frequent jest and laugh, pursue Their labor, making holiday of toil; And, when the work is done, turn cheerly home, Well pleased to know the yearly tax is paid. Now comes the mid-week; and, from various roads, Behold the frequent chaise, with easy jog, Taking its tranquil way to yonder groveâ A grove of Lombard poplars, tall and saint-likeâ And under which the long, low building stands, Gray with the touches of a century,â A house of meditation and of prayer, The favorite temple of meek-handed Peace. There meets the calm community of âFriends,â The old and young, in rigid garb arrayed; The same their grandsires wore, and, in their hope, The same their far descendants shall put on, Remembering their fathers, and their faith And simple piety. The ample brim Shades the white patriarchal hair of age, And the brown locks of youth. There maidenhood, Its gay soul glancing from meek bending eyes, Walks, like the matron, in staid habit dressed. How beautiful, in those straight hoods of silk, And scrupulous lawns which shield their tender necks, The gentle Rachels, Ruths, and Deborahs pass! There oft the Christian virtues come in name, And oft in spirit, walking hand in handâ Hope cheering Faith, with Charity between. But this, alas! is fading; year by year From out the Quaker chrysalis are born The wings which wear the changing hues of fashion; And feet, released, forget their ancient thrall, And for the late constraint, with lighter tread, Lead through the mazes of the intricate dance, Imported fresh from foreign capitals. Their mission is accomplished; and the march Of this calm band, which, in the van of Peace, Walked, conquering with forbearance, 'mid reproach, And jeers of ridicule, is o'er; and now The few who still surround the saintly tent, And prop it 'mid the advancements of the time, May rest upon the memory of the past, Content with its results. The future comes, And things, which have been useful in their day, Are driven into the bygone realms of old, And leave no vestige of their powerful camps. The good, which they have wrought, alone survivesâ The form in which it came, departs, and this Is undistinguishably merged at last, And in the general stream of progress lost. New orders come, as old ones take their leave; And âwelcomeâ sounds not oftener than âadieu.â The streams, which late the storm had overcharged, Have fallen, and left the record of their height Marked on the woodland trunks; while here and there, Where obstacles opposed, the muddy drift Is lodged to dry, and in the summer sun Become the nest of reptiles, and what else In such vicinities consort. When comes The mantled winter, this may be the haunt Of timid rabbits, and the flocking quail; Where oft the hunter, with his dog, shall steal, Tracking the knee-deep snow; and shivering here, The children of the poor shall frequent come, And tear the tangled drift apart, and bear The frozen branch to light their dreary hearth. The stream has fallen; and at the miller's dam, The neighbors, by good Master Ethan called, Collecting come with crow-bar, pick, and spade, And in the breach begin the swift repair. How like a miracle the progress is Of cheerful labor, wrought by numerous bands Working in concert, where the heart and hand Conspire, well pleased, to do a generous act! No hope of recompense, which wealth can give, Sends such alacrity to hands humane, As doth the sense of doing noble duty. The day which sees a liberal deed complete, A fellow-creature in misfortune helped, Falls round the doer, at its evening close, With gentle airs and loving dews of peace; Sleep, like an angel, at his pillow sits, And charms his lids 'gainst ill-intruding dreams. The week draws near its close, and now the school Takes wonted holiday. It is a time The older children are required at home. The wide-mouthed oven must be set a-roar, Well filled by such light brush and broken rails As fence and woodland yield. These bring the boys, Dragging the crackly loads with shouts of glee. At home the girls, delighted, tend the babe, And teach it by the sliding chair to walkâ How beautiful to watch their loving care, The future mother swelling in their breasts! While those, which date nor yet so young nor old, Beneath the orchard crowd the little swing, Or in the barn disturb the secret nest. Some by the roadside build the mimic house, With moss and broken ware set out. Meanwhile The busy matron, o'er the floury tray, Kneads the huge loaf; or on the snowy board Rolls the thin crust, and crimps the juicy pie. Then, from the paddle broad, the pan and dish Glide grating to the heated cave to bake. By noon, the ample tables and the shelves Groan with the weight of swollen loaves, embrowned, And pies arranged to cool; and all the air Is redolent with the delicious scent Which wakes the appetite with expectation, And whets the watery tooth! From the warm south The whispering breezes flow; and the calm sky Is flecked with shadowy vapors, scarcely clouds, Through which the sun rolls lazily and red. This Master Ethan notes, and takes his rodâ For he has heard, for weeks, the whistling swamps, A welcome signal to the fisher's earâ And, with the feeling fresh as when a youth, Makes through the meadow, where the stream invites, And to the surface gives the tempting bait. And there the well-pleased grandchild bears the stringâ No lore of gentle Walton charms his brain; His art is such as anglers only know Who from experience learn to trim the hook And swing the whip-like line. The bait is rude; No artificial fly, with golden wing, Flits o'er the ripple; yet, as oft he throws, The round chub, whirling on its watery wing, Darts through the wave, then flutters on the land. Above, belowâthey will not mar his sportâ The ploughmen, boisterous from their finished fields, With nets relentless scoop the deepest pools, And throw the heterogeneous tribes ashore. Some whose long task detains them through the day, Treading the furrows, when that eve sets in, Will come with torch and spear, and wade the stream; Or at the rude boat's prow, beneath the blaze Dripping with flaming pitch, with watchful eye And steady hand direct the sure harpoon. Another week comes in. The Sabbath past, The old and young are gathered to the fields. Some walk the furrow, and let drop the maize, With measured space between; while some, behind, With hoe industrious conceal the grain, And form the little mounds, erelong to sprout And wave their rustling plumes. This done, behold, The hideous shape is throned upon the field! A figure built awry, with outstretched arms, And, like a drunkard maudlin, in the wind Flutters its rags, and frights the pilfering crow. Now blooms the lilac, sweetening all the air; And by the brook the alder; and the rose, Propt at the cottage door with careful hands, Bursts its green bud, and looks abroad for May. To-morrow, and the smiling month shall come. To-morrow! what delight is in to-morrow! What laughter and what music, breathing joy, Float from the woods and pastures, wavering down, Dropping like echoes through the long to-day, Where childhood waits with weary expectation! BOOK SEVENTH. May has come inâyoung May, the beautifulâ Wearing the sweetest chaplet of the year. Along the eastern corridors she walks, What time the clover rocks the earliest bee, Her feet a flush with sunrise, and her veil Floating in breezy odors o'er her hair; And ample garments, fluttering at the hem, With pleasing rustle round her sandal-shoon. What happy voices wake the rural airs, From hill-side homes and valley cottages, And every village is alive at dawn! Long ere the dews have winged themselves to heaven, In vernal paths the little bands are out, Winning their course, with joyous steps and song, Until the Oaklands take them to their arms, And grove to grove, with loving voice, proclaims The gladness which it feels. Before the sun Hath burnt the western shadows from his dial, Olivia and Amy through the shade Walk in their snowy garments of the time, O'er which the flickering sunshine, through the boughs, Dances amid innumerous phantom leaves, Chasing those lovely forms where'er they go, And starring them with brightness. Arm in arm, They print the tender mosses, and disturb The broad-leafed mandrake, bending here and there To pluck the violets peering through the leaves; Or those small woodland flowers, so delicate That fancy deems them the exotic blooms Of fairy gardens, planted in the night, And nurtured by the moon. With converse sweet, And confidence which young hearts only knowâ So pure themselves, they have not guessed how deep The world is lored in treacheryâthey each To each repeat the secrets of their loves. Beneath yon whispering maple in the lawnâ A dainty lawn in middle of the woodsâ The May-day groups are gathered, and from there The air comes laden with the breath of mirth; And Amy and Olivia, in delight, Withhold their steps, and gaze between the treesâ 'Twixt shadowy vistas of huge mossy trunks And drooping vinesâand watch the floating forms, Now seen, now hid, like stars 'mid broken clouds, All wildly dancing 'neath their scented wreaths, As they the embodied spirits were of flowers. And presently, ascending to her throne, One lovely maid for coronation mounts. And thus, along the gladdened air, is borne The song which greets her and proclaims her queen:â âWe bring roses, beautiful fresh roses, Dewy as the morning and colored like the dawn; Little tents of odor, where the bee reposes, Swooning in sweetness of the bed he dreams upon. Roses, fresh roses, from the young Spring borrowed, To bind round your tresses where the zephyr loves to play. Smile, gentle princess, while your snowy forehead Takes the sweet coronal which crowns you queen of May! Roses, fresh roses, Which crown you queen of May! âWe bring violets, the purple and the azure, Which bloomed at the coming of the bluebird's wizard wing, To greet your dear presence they oped their eyes of pleasure, Then bowed, and they wept that you came not first of spring. Violets, sweet violets, we plucked from April's bosom, The last which he smiled upon before he passed away; And thus round your forehead shall fairy bud and blossom Shine in the coronal which crowns you queen of May! Violets, sweet violets, Which crown you queen of May! âWe bring daisies, little starry daisies, The angels have planted to remind us of the sky. When the stars have vanished they twinkle their mute praises, Telling, in the dewy grass, of brighter fields on high. Daisies, bright daisies, to gleam around your tresses, Until your brow shall shine like the dawning of the day; And thus, as the coronal your lovely forehead presses, We bow to your sceptre, and we hail you queen of May! Daisies, bright daisies, Which crown you queen of May!â Thus fly the hours to youthful fancy dear. Now, midway in the afternoon, the sun Descends upon his poised and flaming wing, Looking aslant the earth; and still The voice of joy, with simple music joined, Thrills through the grove, which not to childhood only Yields up its vernal spaces, but to youths And maidens, who come gayly flocking in, And round the rustic viol reel the dance. There trusting Amy greets a welcome hand, And, hearkening to the voice she loves, floats down From sun to shadow in bewildering maze. The woods swim round, the trees with linkÃ©d hands Whirl through the music and the misty light, With giant gesture and half-human smile, Swaying as to a wind. And thus the maid, Clasped by the arm of love, forgets the world. Alone Olivia strolls beyond the place, Seeking in unfrequented paths the quiet Her soul desiresâcommuning with itself; And following her heart, which fondly leads, She finds the sacred places where, in days Long gone, she walked with Arthur at her side. Here was the spot where from the summer school, When childish liking heralded their love, They wandered, and from honeysuckle boughs Gathered nectarean fruit. Here was the place They walked beside the brook, and gayly plucked The spiry rushes which, with rustic art, They wove in little baskets; such as held The handful of wild berries, after gleaned, From vines which stole beneath the meadow grass, Or at the briery fence-side grew. Here was the sceneâ Dear heart, be calm!âwhere, 'neath these sheltering limbs, When the broad poplar filled his cups of goldâ Where every wandering wind and pilgrim bee Drank, and, departing, boasted of the draughtâ Her ear had caught the low first words of love, Her hand had felt the first declaring pressure; And now, as then, she leans against the tree. Her hair escaping glides unto her shoulder; From out its folds the wild flowers, like her tears, Drip noiseless and unnoted to the ground. The sun descends; the long and level ray Kisses the maiden's shoulder, and glides up, Flaming a little in the poplar's top; Then, lighting on a fleecy cloud o'erhead, Burns, fades, and dies as embers in the ashes. BOOK EIGHTH. The spring departs; and, in her speeding haste, Chased by a swarm of murmuring winds and bees, Scatters the withered lilacs as she flies. The bluebird mourns for her; the russet wren Leads out its young, to see her ere she leaves. Her hands are full of garlands, some abloom, Some budding, and some dead. With floating hair, Thus fled Ophelia in her frenzied hour; And, like Ophelia, from her willow branch, Spring, singing, falls into the lilied pool, And in the crystal stream of summer drowns. The heavens a little weep above her form, What time she floats adown into the past, Till June, full blown and blooming, like her rose, Comes laughing in beneath the rainbow arch. It is the season when the stormy hive Gives forth the noisy whirlwind of its swarm, Which swings a while above its ancient home, With whirrings louder than a housewife's wheel, And warns the dame of their intended flight; When forth she sallies, all aglow with fear And anxious hope, and on the sounding pan Beats like a maniac drummer in mid-battle, Filling the air with wild, discordant noise, Until, for thus her rustic fancy deems, The guiding voice of the great sovereign bee Is drowned amid the tumult. Then, perforce, Their further flight is stayed; and on a limb, With layer o'er layer, they settle till the branch Droops with the black, impending weight; and then The ready hive receives the living mass. Or, if too late the ringing pan assails, Behold the swift and winding line, afar, Flies warping on the sun-illumined air, And mocks the disappointed eye, until Amid the distant forest-boughs it sweeps, And, like a veil entangling, clings and lights Too high to be regained. Then, in some tree, Some hollow oak, or beech, or sycamore, Driving the astonished squirrel from his home, They fix their habitation, and at once Fill up their waxen garners with the sweets The woodland blossoms and the clover yield; And little reck how, in the autumnal hour, The assailing axe shall come, and sulphurous smoke Besiege their woody citadel, until Invading hands usurp their winter store. Now have the flocks been driven unto the brook, And bathed to snowy whiteness 'gainst their will; And, bleating oft beneath the clipping shears, Have yielded up the fleece. The meadow fields Are waving in the sunshine like a sea; A billowy deep, whose flowers are like a foamâ And all abroad, behold the busy throng Of those who swing the clover, as a froth From seething scythes into the sidelong swath, And sharp their blades with many a shrill che-whet. The air is full of perfume. Following these, With laugh and song, gay youths, with glittering prongs, Shake out the scented masses to the sun, Until the noon beholds the fields half mown, And from the hill-side calls the mid-day horn. Some bands there are, in harvest plains remote, Who hearken not the conch's announcing call; But pass into the oak or poplar's shade, And on the branch suspend the glittering scythes, Which hang vibrating; then the circle drawâ The grass alike their table and their seatâ While well-stored baskets furnish forth the meal. The spring near by its crystal tribute gives, And deals its freshness through the rustic gourd. When now the grass, oft turned beneath the sun, Is dry and crisp, and rustles to the tread, Then comes the rake, with many a long-drawn sweep, Gleaning the shaven mead, until the plain, Rough with the sultry stacks, appears a field Thick set with russet tents. And thus it stands Until the wagons, drawn by horse or yoke Of easy oxen, with slow swaying gait, Their large eyes dreaming o'er the rolling cud, Convey the winter store unto the barn. Then what wild laughter fills the heated mow, Where boyhood treads the sweltering waves of hay, Climbing the encroaching billows as they roll, Till like a tide it swells along the roof, Molesting wasps and swallows!âswells and swells, Till the marauding child, with curious eye, Thrusts his adventurous hand into the nestâ The highest in the groovÃ©d rafters lodgedâ And finds but fragments of the tender shell, Which crumble in his fingers, while outside The parent bird darts laughing its derision. Behold yon shape which, down the dusty road, Comes marvellously large! It is a form To frighten childhood from its wayside play; At whose approach the household mastiff barks, And, barking, to his kennel shrinks afraid. It is the peddler, bending 'neath his load, Like mighty Samson with the Gaza gates, Or Atlas with the world. His monthly round Once more hath brought him to these quiet homes. Once more he lets the monster pack descend, Straightens his shoulders, and unbinds the straps, And shows the housewife the enticing store. Long time she looks, yet shakes the cautious head, Swaying 'twixt prudence and desire. Meanwhile The children crowd, with wondering eyes, to see The motley heap, with fingers oft offending, And often chid; while, at her apron, one Clings timidly, and nears, by gradual steps, As wonder gains the mastery of fear. With artful words the petty merchant spreads The various show; now smooths the glossy silk, And holds it to the light aslant; or, dropped To lengthened folds, displays the embryo skirt. There the white lace and there the ribbons gleam, Which light the maiden's eye. The vender's wit, Catching at every favorable sign, Still pours persuasion from his ready tongue; And, in the face of many a stubborn âNo,â Lightens his pack and bleeds the matron's purse. BOOK NINTH. But this is past, and dies the cloudless day. How solemnly and calm the evening falls Around the rural scene! One burning bar Along the shadowy western hill-top flames, And, like the blazing iron upon an anvil, Sinks to a cooler red, and darkly fades, Leaving the vale to twilight. CharmÃ©d hour! Now fall the dews, of which the blossoms drink Deep opiate draughts, till, nodding on their stems, Within their scented mantles folded close, They dream till morn. The sounds of day are done; Innumerous tongues, which only wake at eve, Resume, till night is filled with various notes Which start the inmost fancy into flight, Touching the pleasing chords of melancholy, Until the heart holds sympathy, perforce, With all the dusk invisible. Above, The dreary night-hawk wheels on mournful wings, Like some doomed spirit seeking for its mate, And pours his bitter wail. Within the deep, Impenetrable sorrow of the woods, Like one in weeds, with knotted chords of grief Scourging his heart until it shrieks its woe, The whippoorwill lifts up its direful voice. While, like a demon jeering at their pain, The owl makes answer with his scornful laugh. These are sad sounds; and unto Amy's heartâ Although her lover's arm is at her waist, While their slow feet together brush the path, Sweeping the shadowy pasture near the groveâ They have a voice prophetic which half drowns The joy it is her spirit's wont to hear; And on the wayside grass, methinks, unseen, One tear-drop more than pensive evening weeps Is shed. They tell us angels, good and ill, Attend our steps, to guide or to mislead; If such be true, with what imploring words, And clasped hands, and piteous gaze of eyes, The one oft speaks that would persuade aright, And in the hour by us securest deemed Whispers its fears and warns; the while the other, With smiles assuring safety, strews the path With flowers which lead but to a field of thorns! If this indeed be true, the instinctive tear, The shudder, or each inward faint recoil, Springing we know not whence, should be a voice To stay the swiftest stepâshould be a bolt Transfixing where we standâa giant rock Rising, like sudden gates of adamant, To bar our further course! Alas! too oft We lay our hand on the good angel's lip, And murmur âPeace,â whence peace alone can flow; And list the alluring tongue, whose sweeter words Pour in the soul the airs which yet shall wake The howling storm of discord. âTake this chainââ So speaks a voice, the while a heated cheek Flames at her ownââand wear it for my sake.â Then, with a smile, he drops it on her neck; While in her hand a locket, like an ember, Glows as the wide moon stares above the eastâ Stares, like a ghost, across the maiden's shoulder, Gazing with Amy on the lover's picture. Long time she looks, and then, with trembling care, Within her bosom hides the image dear; Where on her breast, with wide and stolid eyes, It lies and warms against her beating heart, Swaying to each emotion, while the moon A moment glides behind a fleecy vapor, And floods it into whiteness like a shroud. Olivia, with her little taper's light, Looks from her chamber window to the eastâ Looks long with mingled feelings, chiefly hope; And when a star aslant the zenith drops, A sigh from out her heart responds, and then A vision of her gentle friend and lover Rises; and now amid the May-day groups, She once more watches where the reeling dance Whirls their light forms along, from sun to shade. So swift is thought that, ere the meteor line Has faded but a moment from across The rising constellation, in her breast The name of Arthur questions every star; What time each lifts its silvery brow to sight, And gazes o'er th' horizon's woody bar;â What news it brings from out the Orient, What tidings it hath carried in its heart, Which not the loud pervading sea could drown, Or time or distance mar? What words of love, What longing westward looks, from those dear lips And faithful eyes, of one who travels far? And when the pillow holds her golden hair, She hears the happiest sounds which charm the night; But chiefly, from afar, the flashing stream Which rustles o'er the breastwork at the mill With ceaseless music. Oftenâoh, how oftâ By that same sound hath Arthur's ear been soothed Till slumber weighed with melody his lids! And sympathizing with the sacred vision Her fancy sees, the while his name in prayer Passes, and yet seems lingering on her lips, A gentle dream before her spirit steals, Closing the doors of sleep upon her soul. BOOK TENTH. What sounds are these which thrill the morning star, Hailing the advancing banner of the sun, While now the herald dawn, with backward hair, Inflates his winding horn, and wakes the day, Speeding across the hill-tops? Hark, the roll Of distant cannon rumbling through the sky, As if a huge triumphal car, in haste, Were rolling and resounding through the streets Of some glad city welcoming its return; While lesser sounds of bells and rattling guns Swell the rejoicing hour! It is the day When Independence celebrates her birthâ The Jubilee of Freedom yearly kept! A nation rising from its rest secure; A nation which hath never worn a crown; A land which hath not held a throne, or felt The foot of king, or seen his purple robe, Sends up its voice, with one loud shout of joy, Which starts the eagle of the Nor'most lake, And wakes the Mexic gulfâwhile on his shore The Atlantic hears, and his eternal head Lifts, and prolongs the soundâtill in the West, On stretching sands, in many an unknown bay, 'Mid shadowy slumber the Pacific smiles, Catching the cadence as it dies, and dreams Of Freedom's cities rising on his coast, And navies showing Liberty her flag! It is a sound to flush the patriot's breast, And drive the color from the tyrant's cheek; Where on his olden and decaying throne, He stands agaze, and, staring o'er the sea, Wonders; and, with a nervous hand of haste, Presses the weighty crown upon his brow, And grasps the sceptre his amaze hath loosed, Assuring him a king! Long be the day Remembered, and awaked with shouts, as now! From every home the gladsome people pour; O'er woods and fields resound the drum and fife; And presently the flaming banners, rich With golden mottoes and with silver stars. Along the highway set ablaze the air: As in the hour when wildly on the sky They wrote in words of fire the despot's fall, Dazzling his dull uncomprehending eye With âweighed and wanting!â till the interpreter, The father of a grateful country, came And read the âUpharsinâ to his startled ear! With one accord, the various cottage-homes Pour down the paths and highways to the townâ The village on the white and dusty roadâ Their several habitants. The young and old, Each bent on pleasing and on being pleased, Are ranged into procession, two by two, While many a jest and laugh run down the line. Across the pasture, winding to the grove, All follow, to the measure of that tune Which first had birth upon Derision's lips, Till Victory heard, and with exulting tongue Echoed the notes, that, hallowed by her voice, Henceforth became an anthem for a nation! Already the rude table's giant length Stretches beneath the embowering limbs, and scents The fragrant air with pine. Adjacent, see The speaker's rostrumârough, as suits the time, And strongâwhere, caught aloft in smooth festoons, Two silken banners of the stripes and stars, With friendly points of glittering spear-heads crossed, Delight the enthusiast's eye. Anon, 'Mid shouts, the leaders take the stand; and now The parson pours the solemn thankful prayer, The gratitude which every freeman feels. Then rises Master Ethan, tall and frail, And clearly, with well-modulated voice, Reads the great âDeclarationâ to the end. Whereat a long huzza, from every heart, Shakes the deep welkin, while the boughs between Murmur afar, and each astonished bird Drops in the trees and listens. Then arises The song which every tongue delights to swell. This past, the fiery speech inflames the hour, Oft interrupted by the loud applause; And with a loving ardor lingers long O'er scenes our grandsires, in the years agoneâ What time they held us charmed upon their kneesâ Pictured unto our childish eyes, until The little soul, to patriot's teaching true, Rose up in arms and waved the mimic sword. Then comes the plenteous feast, with stated toasts, And music and gay song between. And now, In brimming cups the amber cider flows, Sparkling and sweet, smelling of autumn brown; Three years apast from out the creaking press It streamed, and now full ripe and rich it glows In cooling pitchers, starred and streaked with dew; Or paler beverage, where the citron swims, Yielding the acid from its severed sphere, And shedding odors of the melting South, So nectarine, the wasp attracted comes, An armed republican, and tastes the cup Ere the libation, at the waiting mouth, Is pledged to Liberty. BOOK ELEVENTH. Thus flies the hour. Meanwhile, O Muse, withdraw awhile apart, And note yon figure bending in the woods. It is the dame of Oakland gathering herbsâ Here plucking liverwort, and there the rank Hot stems of pennyroyalâand, anon, With crooked fingers, in the easy mould, Digging the sinuous snake-root, and what else Her curious knowledge finds. In bundles tied, These all must at her odorous ceiling hang, To dry 'mid swinging sheaves of various mint, Plucked from the garden and the brook; with sage, Savoring of Christmas, and wild chamomile, With bitterer tansy, and the virtuous barks Of elm and sassafras; with much beside, Shedding perpetual perfume round the joists, Forgot, or to the muse unknown. She kneels; And, as she gathers, mumbles words, unheard, Whose import none may know except those forms Invisible which bend the attentive ear, And catch the faintest breathings of the soul; Interpreting the murmurs of a child, The honeyed accents swarming at its lips, And the low blended, toothless sounds of age. Not long she bends when, with a tongue uncouth, The round Distiller, all aglow with heat, Comes fuming like his still; for he hath strode Throughout the morn across the stretching lands, Armed with the heavy hickory which he wears, To note if, in the all-exulting hour, A foot should dare to trespass on his grounds. Thus, ever, the bad man is seen abroad Grudging the innocent joy, which others feel, Impossible to him; while Jealousy, Within the envious precincts of his heart, Suggests the wicked act, and, with a smile, Gloats o'er the cruelty ere it is done. The fairest landscape may not mould a heart; A niggard in his palace still is mean; And cruelty may native be to scenes Whose loveliness might move another's tears. See how his set teeth grind in base delight, And how he strikes from side to side, and beats A fancied culprit at each blow! He speaks:â âWhat bring'st thou, hag, to trespass on these grounds? What stealest thou within these woods forbid?â To which the woman, rising on her staff:â âI gather simples that thou know'st not of: Here's this to cool, and here is this which gives A generous heat when ague numbs the heart. Oh, I can find all plants, and roots, and barks, Which Nature's storehouse yields. I know them all; And, better than your school-diploma'd leech, Can I prescribe the antidote of ills Which fire or freeze the blood; but in my art, I do avow 'fore Heaven, I know no power Of herb to cool a feverish temper vile, Or thaw the starving ague of a soul!â To which the man, with lifted cane, replies:â âHence, with a bridle on thy tongue, or else Beware the weight of this!â When thus the dame, Shaking her skinny finger o'er her staff:â âOnce came a beggar to a rich man's gate, Asking the crumbs which from his table fell; He was refusedâperchance thou know'st the rest. These simples, to the fulness of thy land, Are less than were the crumbs beneath that table. All these untended here, self-planted, grow From year to year, and custom's long consent Hath yielded them to serve the general use. I do not trespass, and I do not steal; Nor shalt thou say it unrebuked. These grounds, They are not thine save by a legal lie, Stolen by trick, or bought with devils' bloodâ I mean the poison dripping from yon stillâ And might the wronged man from his coffin rise, And, with the widow and the orphan, tell The baseness of thy cunning, the dull ear Of common justice should be stunned and pained, And the loud public tongue cry out thy shame, And retribution, like a bolt of fire Amid the thunder, fall.â E'en as she speaks, She seems to rise above her wonted height; Her gray locks falling take the passing breeze, Her eyes indignant flame, and on her lip Scorn sits supreme, and mocks the lifted cane. Meanwhile the blood to the distiller's brow Mounts with swift madness, and his whole broad face Burns like a furnace by the bellows blown. âHence, witch!â he cries; and reeling from his aim, With a loud shriek of oaths, he strikes the air, And striking falls, foaming at mouth, convulsed The apoplectic blood, inflamed, hath drowned His brain; and there, with horrible distort Of face and frame, he clutching tears the ground. These are rough touches, but they give the life, The scars and moles which make the picture true. And thus he lies until a sauntering group, Which presently comes by, in wonder stops; And takes the fallen man in charge, and bears Him writhing home. The dame, with musing voice, Speaks as they go, and they may hear who willâ âTwice hath the mad ox grovelled in the dust, Dragged by the dogs of anger; when again They take him to the earth, he shall not rise.â And now once more she kneels above her task, And, digging, traces the eccentric root. BOOK TWELFTH. Let us descend afar the summer road, And note how in the crowded mart is kept The sacred day. Along the harvest fields, Throughout the stretching valley, smokes the air With a long line of the impending dust, Sultry and thick, until the Sunday garb Of smoothest black becomes a suit of gray, And the deep standing grain beside the road Bows low with the collecting weight; while feet Innumerous are plumping in the dust, Deep as the fetlocks, as it were a snow; And flying wheels fling from their tires and spokes Invisible the choking cloud. Behold the inn, Midway between the village and the town, Where waves the starry flag across the way, Swung from the house-top to the opposing tree, A silken arch of triumph. O'er the porch Swarm out and in, like bees about a hive, The noisy people whom the keeper greets With smile incessant and unfailing joke. Lo, how the hot air reeks with the perfume Of crushing mint, in potent glasses drowned, And smoke of Cuban weed; or, stronger yet, Of rank plant cultured in Kentuckian fields. From either side the high and pendulous sign The painted eagle looks, with spreading wings, As if to sentinel the coming guest. But 'neath his shade, with an unchecking rein, Behold yon party pass! Olivia there, Between her parents, sits with glowing cheeks. Thus ride they on until, beyond the hill, In the far smoky landscape, winding slow, They catch with eager gaze the silvery line Of tranquil Delaware; so distance-veiled, The eye, unaided, scarcely notes the sail Brooding in middle of receding plains. Then bursts the glowing city on the view; Waking a pleasurable sense which none So deep in soul can feel as they who bring The mind well stored with rural lore, and wear At heart the freshness of the summer fields. Thus, in lost ages of the long ago, The rustic swains, girded with simple skins, From Carmel's side or cedared Lebanon, Beheld the gorgeous city at their feet, What time the yearly festival enticed, Its thousand banners swelling on the wind, And every breeze with music jubilant, And gates all wide. Or thus the pilgrim band, A weary with long travel, sore of feet, Turning some point of the Abruzzian mount, Beholds the plain, and Tiber winding dim, And the long stretch of ancient aqueducts, Striding like caravans the blue champaign; Till, lo! the Roman capital appears, Crowned with the dome which crowns the world! Anon, The Schuylkill, sacred to the barge of mirth, Its green banks consecrate to pleasure's paths, Winds into sight with many a silvery curve; And at the breastwork, with a ceaseless voice, Rustles the music which its waters learned, On mountain wilds remote, where Carbon's hills Hear in their inmost heart the miner's stroke. Behold the mound by art and nature reared, âFairmount!â in whose tall top the waters lie Lifted as in a great baptismal font; The height from whence the river deity Pours, from his giant and refreshing urn, The stream which slakes a grateful city's thirst. But fancy this; for yet no statue there, Worthy the place, above his liquid task Stands to the four winds, beautiful and bright, Gazing upon the city which he laves, While the glad city gazes back to him. Oh! wherefore rises not the marble pile Above this green and consecrated height? Not one, but many, one above the rest, Looking like Alleghany o'er his hills. Lo, how it bathes unnumbered miles of streetsâ A great heart pulsing through far crystal veinsâ Where, but a few short generations since, The Indian stretched his lazy sombre length, And the red deer stooped, undeterred, and drank, Or, 'neath the chestnut or the walnut shade, Cropped the rank grass at leisure. At the bridge, The horses sudden tramp the sounding planks; Where passes oft the Conestoga team, Ringing its own announcement of approach, With shoulder-shaken bellsâa monster wain, Slow, rumbling, and which oft in winter sends The shrilly creak from frosty wheels afar. How the white noon awakes to the report Of all explosive engines known to man, From the sharp cracker to the roaring bass Of cannon, answering from square to square! At every proclamation shaking earth, And rattling every window; while the scent Of wasted powder loads each breath inhaled, As in some town resisting when besieged. From street to street the party takes its way, Gazing on the procession as they pass With wondering admiration. There they see, In costly uniform, the shining troops Of armed volunteers; or there the long, Proud lines of labor, honoring their trades, Parading with bright banners; and the stout, Brave firemen decked in helmet and in capeâ A conflagration pictured upon eachâ Their costly engine wreathed about with flowersâ Drawing as 'twere a conqueror's car. No day, Of all the year, is so alive as this; No other day hath this calm city been So driven from staid propriety, and waked To such wild, joyous riot; save that time When youthful feet ran boundless through the streets, To fix the childish gaze on one who came Welcomed with honor's highest, last excessâ The honor only rivalled by the loveâ Taking his glorious way with roses strewn, And under endless bannered arches, starred With one proud name, still sacredââLa Fayette!â And still the party wander down the street, Oft gazing on the snowy marble pile; Or stroll into the crowded squares, and walk Beneath the shade of ancient forest-trees, Greeting them all as friends. Oh, wherefore, ye Who hold the welfare of the town at heart, And wield its destinies, will ye behold The city, with its hot and rapid feet, Trample the woods and blight the fields; nor leave One ampler space where, on a day like this, The thankful throng may walk abroad, and feel The pleasure which it is to breathe the air Which, unimpeded by the heated walls, Takes health and freshness from the leaves it stirs, And gives to whom inhales? Nor yet too late, While those wide spacesâfull of sun and shade, And antique trees, with daily trembling filled And apprehension of the approaching axeâ O'er Schuylkill spread their asking arms, and call Aloud for your protection. Ere the street, With frequent ringing of the builder's trowel, Usurps their quiet depth, go boldly forth; And, with your powerful wand of office, draw The boundary line which none shall dare invade. And every tree, thus rescued, when the crowds Of future generations walk beneath, Shall whisper to their grateful ears your name; And be a vernal monument, each year, Renewing honor to the rescuer. BOOK THIRTEENTH. Here, stranger, stay! This is the sacred spot Which knew the patriots in the years agone. Here trod the noblest form the land has known; Here swelled the stateliest soul e'er form has held; And hereânor here alone, but round the world, And throughout heavenâmy faith will have it soâ The name most loved is spoken, and rolls on Revered by freemen, and by angels breathed, And trembling oft upon the lips of slaves, Brightening their dream of hope. Still to our hearts Let the great name of Washington be dear; And faithful as the star is to the night, Or as Niagara to his cataract true, Let the increasing stream of praise be poured From off a nation's tongue. This is the spot: Here is the hallowed hall where bravely met Freedom's stout conclave, pledging lives and honor; And this the terrace, looking to the square, Where Liberty's apostle, all aglow With the wild ardor of the hour, came forth, And, to the applauding patriot crowd without, Read the great chart ere yet the names were dry. This is the place: and there, upon the step, Behold, where sits yon figure scarred and gray, His stout staff taking palsy from his hand, And shaking on the door-stone. Here, once more, He pays the yearly visit to the spot, And lives in memory all the glorious past; And thus unto the group of listeners gives The visions of gone days, as one by one They rise before his spiritual eye. âLo, now the cannon thundering to the sky, The thickening fumes that scent the heated air, Recall the camp, and spread before mine eye The pitch of battle and the triumph there. âThe summoned ploughman grasps the ready gun, And swiftly strides across the furrowed sod; The smith, ere half the heated shoe is done, Swings on in haste, and rides the steed unshod. âThe mason flings his glittering trowel by, And leaves behind the pale and weeping few; The miller's wheel above the stream hangs dry, While o'er the hill he waves the swift adieu. âLo, all the air is throbbing to the drum; In every highway sounds the shrilly fife; And flashing guns proclaim afar they come, Where hurried banners lead the way to strife. âThough rude the music, and the arms are rude, And rustic garments fill the motley line, Yet noble hearts, with noble hopes imbued, Thrill through the ranks with energy divine,â âThrill through the ranks until those sounds become Celestial melodies from Freedom's lips! These arms an engine to strike despots dumb, And leave oppression howling in eclipse. âThen comes the struggle, raging loud and longâ The seven years' battle with the banded foesâ The tyrant, and the savage, and the strong Grim arm of want with all its direst woes. âHalf clad and barefoot, bleeding where they tread, Where hunger and disease allied consort, The pale survivors stand among their dead, And brave the winter in their snow-walled fort. âBut heavier than the storms which fold the Earth, Than all the ills which winter's hand commits, The bitter thought that at the sacred hearth Of unprotected homes some horror sits. âBut God is just; and they who suffer most Win most; for tardy triumph comes at last! The patriot, bravely dying at his post, Hath rivalled all the CÃ¦sars of the past. âRight conquers Wrong, and glory follows pain, The cause of Freedom vindicated stands; And heaven consents; while, staring o'er the main, Old Europe greets us with approving hands. âIf now a film o'erswim my aged gaze, Or if a tremor in my voice appear, It is the memory of those glorious days Which moves my failing frame and starts the tear. âOh, on this sacred spot again to rest, Where passed the patriots, ere this old heart faints! Then I depart, with a contended breast, Where they are walking crowned among the saints. âHere on these steps, made holy by their tread, I list their kindling voices as of yore; And hear that bell, now hanging speechless, dead, Which rung for Freedom, broke, and rung no more. âBroke with the welcome tidings on its tongue, Broke, like a heart, with joy's excessive note! 'Tis well no cause less glorious e'er hath rung In silver music from its hallowed throat.â BOOK FOURTEENTH. Behold the river, wide, respiring, vast, Swelling and falling, answering to the main. Here rise and sink the multitudinous ships, Swaying in slumberous ease, where every flag Known to a Christian sky salutes the air. How the brown cordage like a net-work spreads, A monster web entangling leafless pines! From this same wharf, down dropping with the tide, Went Arthur, when he bade his last adieuâ While the great bay, as usherer to the sea, Unto the ocean's awful presence ledâ There stands the maid in secret musing held, While from the charmÃ©d fountains of her soul The longing tear upwells. The sun descends; And like a startling meteor in the sky, The whizzing rocket streaks the twilight air, And curving up the azure deep afar, Explodes with muffled sound, and lights the eve With momentary stars of various hue. In swift succession how they soar and burst, Answered from all the quarters of the town, Till oft the sky is full of falling lights; As on that memorable autumn night, When rained the heavens a thick meteoric shower, Puzzling the wise astronomers at watch, And shaking many a sturdy soul with fear, Till superstition, with affrighted voice, Proclaimed the day of doom. From yon green isle, Which like a war-ship on the water lies, The arrowy signals chiefly fly; while come The joyous habitants and crowd the wharves, The ships, the ferries, barges and bateaux, And skiffs that glide between, while every house From base to roof o'erflows. And now the night, While every face unto the island looks, Falls deeply down; and all the curious stars People the dark, and, crowding group o'er group, Gaze from the shadowy terraces of heaven, And wonder at the fires that mock their light. Hark, the loud rattle, like artillery! And note the phantom lustre on each face, Swift changing through the iris scale of hues, Most strange and beautiful, thrown from yon wheel, Which from its flails of fire flings the light sparks Like chaff upon the air, with whirrings loud, While admiration flies from face to face. Nor this alone; wheel after wheel is fired, Whirling continuous, discharging lights Innumerous as summer dust; until Behold the flaming chariot appears, A swift triumphal car ablaze with gems, And flying through a crowd of welcoming roses, Where Liberty a starry goddess rides, While o'er her head her favorite eagle sails On guardian wings of fire. And suddenly A temple lifts its constellated front, Swinging its great arch, drawn in blazing lines, Athwart the dark with architecture strange, Inspiring, grand; as if the stars of heaven Should sweep together, clustering into form, To show the world the dome where Freedom dwells. And lo! the glorious vision in the tide Inverted hangs in wavering lines of light: Such is the pyrotechnist's art. And now The sky vibrates with the prolonged applause; The lights die out; the night resumes its sway, While peace and silence close the festive gates. Olivia, weary, to her pillow strange Resigns her cheek, while through her wakeful brain The visions of the day, in clear review, Pass one by one, and fright the wings of sleep. Hour after hour, the watchman's sounding tread And solemn voice alarm the sinking lid, And wake the thought afresh; till, presently, The whirling rattle and the startling cry Of âfire!â too frequent heard, disturb the town, Breaking the charm of midnight; while reply From spire and tower the wild and direful bells, Directing with their strokes the engines' course, Which now fly thundering to assail the blaze, And soon to conquer. Rising on the sky, Destruction's banner, like a boreal light, Dilates and brightens, till the maiden's room, Though safe, is full of splendor like a noon. She hears the frequent heavy brakes descend, Mingled with voices and with hurrying feet, Till gradually the drownÃ©d flame submits, While slowly dies the hue from out her chamber. And now once more the quiet, like a bird Untimely startled from its rest, refolds Its wings, and drops through visions into sleep. BOOK FIFTEENTH. When I recount the pleasant sights of earthâ Fair childhood blowing bubbles in the sunâ A pleasure-party, in a moonlit barque; The little sail with breeze and music swelledâ A dancing wreath of children crowning Mayâ A bridal group across a distant field Returning, with gay footsteps, from the churchâ I can recall no brighter, nobler scene Than men at labor 'mid the waving grain, When summer, with its alchemy, transmutes The crops from green to gold! The harvest sun Burns broad and white above the yellowing world, Which, for its plenty, laughs a rustling laugh; A voice which cheers the hearts of those who strode Athwart the yielding ground, with swinging hands, In springtime, casting bread upon the earth, To be returned a hundredfold. The air Hangs hot and silent, save where yonder bird, The meadow-lark, darts into sudden voice From out the grain, and in the next tree lights, And, panting, sings no more; or where, perchance, The oriole, careless of its swinging nest, From whence the young have flown, a moment streaks The sky with fire and song, and then gives o'er; Or yon tricolored bird, with nervous haste Ascending spirally the sapless trunk, Drums loudly as he climbs; or locust hid Swift springs his shrilly rattle; or the small Green insect, greener than the grass it bends, With the field cricket lifts its jarring voice; While his gray brother, on ambitious wings, Flickers his short flight down the summer road, Oft dropping in the sultry sand. Behold The yellow, dainty-pinioned swarm arise, On simultaneous wings, as soars a flame; Or, settling where the small spring blots the dust, Glows like a golden group of buttercups. What a calm realm of sunshine gleams the world; The aspen only feels a phantom breath; Beneath the great tree's shadow in the field The silent cattle stand; and in the cool Deep shade of garden-shrubs the fowls are hid, Fluttering the dust upon their wings, with eye Suspicious watching oft the hawk which sails, Noiseless as sleep, upon the lofty air. Beside the spring, where the tall sycamore, And one wide willow, roof the cooling spot, The dairy-maid is singing 'mid her pans, And skimming oft the deep and yellow cream, While floats abroad the sweet delicious scent Of cedar from the scalded churn. And now, With many a rumbling splash, the dasher flies, Forcing the cream which oozes at the lid. At length the gathering weight, which lifts and falls, Denotes the labor through. In days like these, An hour suffices to transmute the mass, Which oft, in winter, whirls from morn till noon, Or later still, refusing to obeyâ Withheld, as some have deemed, by witch's charm. Along the wayside fence, by briery roads. The ruddy children, with their fingers stained, Collect the berries which, with milk combined, Shall to the reaper's hearty palate give The luscious dessert when the meat is past. The full fields, like a shepherd's flock in spring, Yield up their fleeces, till the well-bound sheaves, In glowing stacks, nod o'er the stubbled farm. Now sounds the horn 'neath the meridian sun; And the brown laborers, hurrying to the call, Beside the deep well lave their heated brows; Where oft the bucket from the windlass drops, Rattling till deluged, then, ascending slow, Comes dripping to the brink, and sends abroad A cool and grateful freshness. Then behold Where sweeps the table wide, from door to door, Looking from east to west. With open brow The generous matron welcomes in the group; And there Olivia, not too proud to tend, But with a flush of pleasure on her face, Glides gracefully from chair to chair, and helps The glowing reaper's plate; here fills the glass With odorous cider, sparkling as it flows, Or drowns the bowl with liquid from the churn, Cooled at the spring beside the yellow prints. Here smokes the ample joint, and steaming there The yellow ears of maize inviting stand, Fresh from the caldron drainedâdelicious food, To other lands unknownâwith much beside. When this is past, the berries crown the board, The whortle from the wood, and those at morn Plucked from the wayside briers. The garden, too, And orchard lend their fulness to the hour; For 'tis the season when the generous year Pours from his plenteous horn the ripened fruitâ The mellow peach, and bursting purple plum, The early apple, and the golden pear; But chiefly the huge melon, which, when ripe, Yields, to the pressing hands and listening ear, A crisp and frosty sound, from out its heart Of crimson snow, that calls the thirsty knife. Thus flies the noon, until the heated fields Recall to labor, and the day goes by. Now, when the eve sets in, and one by one The stars come leaping o'er the eastern bar, And the great moon, aflush with summer heat, Climbs lazily along the harvest skyâ Where dart the fire-flies with eccentric course, Oping their frequent dainty lantern-doors, As if to find a treasure lostâthe group Of reapers gather on the social porch, And pass the shadowy hour in language meet The season and the place. And much they talk Of news which lately, from the far-off West, The time represented in this poem was about the year 1832, at which period, as many will remember, the âbackwoods feverâ was especially prevalent. Startled the calm community; as when Some foreign sound disturbs the laboring hiveâ Or bee, returning from exploring search, Proclaims a land of more enticing sweets, And wakes a general buzz throughout the swarm. The younger men are restless to be gone, And descant largely on the wild pursuit Of game, exhaustless in the boundless woods. Some shake the doubtful headâthe older theseâ And tell of labors long to be enduredâ The battle with the forest, and the stern Privation to be borne, where oft the call Of chill necessity affrights the soul; Repeating tales their childhood frequent heard From sires who 'mid these hills and valleys came, And, with the guardian fire-arm at their side, Laid the loud axe unto the woodland's foot. But what was meant to caution and deter, Inflames the youthful fancy and desire; And even Age detects along his veins A curious yet an unacknowledged glow, And feels an impulse rising in his breast He hath not felt for years; and, to conceal How much his spirit echoes younger thought, Puts by the subject with some careless jest, And turns the converse on to-morrow's task. Now see where strides, o'er many a homeward field, The hired laborer to his lowly cot: The shouldered sickle, by the moonshine lit, Gleams like a rising crescent. At the door His happy wife, and happier children, stand And welcome his return. Then to his couch, To others hard, luxurious to him, Softened by toil, he turns, and drains the cupâ The drowning cup of sleepâunto the dregs. BOOK SIXTEENTH. On yonder hill, with oak and hickory crowned, What sight is that which draws, from far and near, The thronging people up the dusty roads, And through each field where'er a by-path leads? See, where the red and new-arisen sun Points his bright finger through the upland grove, Flushing the white tents to a rosy hue! And hark, the call of the resounding horn, Which Echo, from yon hill, with slumberous shell Blows softly back! Are these the tents of war, By some proud general pitched, where bayonets gleam, And sentinels walk, and banners to the drum Dance in mid-air, and flap their sanguine folds? It is the camp of that increasing strife Waged 'gainst a world of sin; it is a host Come out upon the glorious side of Truth, To fight, to suffer, and, with love, to conquer! With songs triumphal under flags of peace, Spread like the wings of swans upon the wind, They hold their siege against the walls of Wrong, And will not rest till on the highest tower Which crowns his ramparts that white banner floats. There Wesley's spirit hovers, and, with voice Clear as a bugle winding 'mid the hills, The soul of Whitefield soars. There, with long beard Sweeping his patriarchal breast, arrives The apostle-pilgrim, punctual to the hourâ Lorenzo, the eccentricâand at once Mounts the rough desk, and lifts his startling voice, While eager thousands crowd the space to look; And seeing, hear; and every neighboring tree Is populous with faces forward bent. Here, scoffer, smooth the scorn from off thy lip; Nor you, nor I, though holding faith diverse, May sit in judgment and condemn the scene. Though we approve not, wiser heads than ours Have bowed and worshipped at the woodland altar, And pressed the temporary couch at night Within the wavy tent, and often found The peace which they had sought elsewhere in vain. Let us not waste the vigor of our minds In acrimonious quarrels over creeds. Not ours the business of dispute; but ours, Ye gentle hearts for whom I chiefly sing, The pleasing duty to find good in all; And, finding, recognize and own in each A brotherhood, no difference of faith May set ajar. Nor Brahmin, Turk, nor Jew, Nor he who kneels to Deity in stonesâ The savage instinct searching for its Godâ Each seeking truth the nearest way he knows, Shall wake in me one cold condemning wordâ While Charity, the sweetest child of Heaven, Hides her bright face, and weeps behind her wingsâ But love instead. And we will interchange Whatever thought may cheer each other on; For all are pilgrims on one darksome road: One may have store of water, and no bread; The other bread, and faint with sultry thirst; One plenteous oil, another but dry wick. Hence is our duty plain; and simple need, Left to itself, would teach us oft aright, Which, prejudiced by doctrines of a sect, Would leave us hungry, thirsty, or at night Give but a lightless lantern. Let who will Quarrel o'er outward forms: so quarrelled they Who gambled for the garments of our Lord, And heard not the deep agony of soul Of Him who cast all mantles by as vain, And died for simple truth. BOOK SEVENTEENTH. The summer flies, And Autumn slowly comes, his withering breath Crisping whate'er he breathes on; and the woods He sets ablaze with gorgeous hues which burn, With noiseless flame, until the foliage falls, Strewing the ground like embers, while the limbs Spread to the sky their empty ashen arms. At her lone window, drawn from household cares, Olivia sits, and to her lover writes; And thus the ardor of her fancy flows:â âThe months go by, the seasons slow depart, With steps reluctant, looking to the time When thou wert hereâhow different their flight! I think one-half the sunshine went with thee, And, like my thoughts, the better half. And now The dreary autumn comes, the sighing days, With which my heart seems strangely set in tune. Here, where I gaze, I see the stubbled fields, The reddening forest, and the misty airâ All sights and sounds which make the soul alone. Day after day, the flying flocks go south, In living lines, which write along the sky The prophecy of winter's sure approach; I hear at night their voices o'er the roof, Mingled with whirring wings. On yonder plain The rustling maize, in many a bowing shock, Whispers to every passing breeze. Last night, Beneath the white moon, in the silent air, In jovial bands the huskers, flocking, came, And stripped the covers from the yellow ears, And left them glowing there in golden mounds. Oh, how the song, and jest, and laugh went round! And when the crimson ear was found, the prize Was held in blazing splendor, like a torch. And all proclaimed a âsweetheart,â and rejoiced. I stood apart, and, as in days agone, Hearkened to hear thy voice among the rest; But there were none so happy or so clear, Or, as I fancied, half so musical. Within-doors, through the busy afternoon. Till late at eve, the neighboring dames and maids Found social pleasure round the spreading quilt, With rapid hands, till on the oft-rolled frame The latest puffy diamond-row was stitched. Then, when the gay and separate tasks were done, And noisy supper past, the room was cleared; When mirth, and music, and the mazy dance Reeled through the night till every rafter groaned, While swayed the floor beneath their gliding feet. I could not dance, and could not join the glee; Each smile I forced was half akin to tears; So clearly came the old times o'er my mind. To-day the orchard yields its glowing fruits, Which tumble, widely, with a thunderous sound, Shaken from stormy boughsâa monster hail. And there the creaking cider-press is fed, And oozes the sweet liquid through the straw, Where gather the inebriate bees and wasps; And childhood imitates the winged thieves With wheaten pipes which yield the nectar draught. The sweetened air across the casement floats, And merriment invites abroad. Ah me! How pining Memory flies into the past, And lives in the departed sceneâso fond, She cannot taste the pleasure of to-day! Then were we children, and in hours like this None were more happy. It is now the time When slumber seems to hover on the air. O'er all the veil of Indian summer floats, Blue, thin, and silent, lovely as a dreamâ A dream which, presently, the North shall wake, The shrewish North, with shrilly tongue of storm. The sounding flails, and Bowman's beating loom, Pulse through the brooding air. From out yon barn Floats the loud tempest of the sweeping fan; While, on the stormy gust its wings create, Beyond the door the winnowed chaff is blown, Swarming like golden bees. E'en where I sit, I can behold the great wheel of the mill Flashing its silvery circles in the sun, And yet so distant cannot hear its song. All happiest sights and sounds seem held afar. In the dear light of memory thou dost stand; I see thee smile, yet cannot hear thy voice. It is the season when the woodland trees, Through yellow fingers, shed the plenteous nuts; When happy children, from the school released, Wander from grove to grove. Canst thou not yet Bring back to fancy those departed days When we, together, with our baskets went, Shelling the walnuts till our little hands Were like the Autumn's brown? or chestnuts found Dropped from their starry burrs? or with the squirrels, Beneath the hickory, shared the shell-bark's store? How then we spread them in the loft to dry, Between the rolls of wool for winter wheelsâ The loft made odorous by the bundled herbs? Ah, yes, thou needs must often see it all, And, seeing, sigh for the delightful hours. Oft have I prayed for thy returnâhow oft!â But chiefly now, for these are changeful times. Loud Rumor's voice entices to the Westâ The call from out the backwoods daily comesâ The only topic when the neighbors meet; And the excitement like a fever spreads, Contagious, till one cannot safely say Who, ere another summer, may depart To be immured in the far forest's gloom. The drover, with his cattle passing by, Tells marvellous stories of that plenteous land, Inflaming all he meets. And frequently A letter from its three weeks' journey rests, Breathing of woods primeval, and confirms The floating tale, advising all to come. Even round our fireside spreads the exciting theme. Wert thou but here, to join in the exploit, The wilderness were welcome as the town.â And more she writes; but let the veil be drawn Between the world and her more tender thoughts. BOOK EIGHTEENTH. Now comes the muster's jovial, motley day, Remnant of troublous times; and after this Election follows. To the neighboring town The farmers flock, and, gathering in crowds, Discuss their candidates with growing warmth, Then drop the powerful scrip into the pollâ The little weight which turns a nation's scaleâ Where oft a world-wide interest is weighed Beyond recall, and settled. Let no vote Be dropped with careless thought; for it may be The last strong hand which draws the lever down Which moves the giant destiny of man No future shall replace. What power is yours, Ye heirs of what the patriots bequeathed! The hand which holds a plough is strong as that, And stronger oft, than which a sceptre grasps. Then be ye each as watchful as a king, And jealous of your rights; yet generous, As only freemen can afford to be. Behold where walks the white-haired beldam, Frost, Breathing her bitterness o'er all the sceneâ She whom erewhile we hailed as maiden Dew. The flowers she fed, when morning-glories blew Their white and purple trumpets to the dawn, Are nipped and withered by her fingers cold; The grass is crisp and brittle 'neath her tread; And, like a witch, she flies the broad clear sun, But works her charm beneath the gibbous moon. See, where the joyous Hallow-eve comes in, And how the country is awaked to mirth! While, far and near, the sleepless watch-dog's bark Responds from farm to farm, till oft the wife Starts from her couch to peer with anxious eye, Or, on her troubled pillow, dreams of harm In cabbage-plots or poultry-sheds sustained. Round many a hearth, in noisy groups, collect The youths and maids, and there Pomona reigns. Swift flies the apple to the paring blade, While, like a serpent, falls the coiling peel. Some quarter and take out the core, and some Attend the giant caldron o'er the fire, Which on the huge crane stretched from jamb to jamb, Wide as a gate that lets a chariot pass, Swings o'er the blaze with cider steaming hot, Where the brown stirrer with its handle long A ceaseless motion keeps. Thus flies the night, Until the odorous mass grows thick and dark, Which then is dipped in various jars to cool. And now the reel, to some rude Afric's viol, Whirls through the shadowy hour, till oft the star Of morning lights the laughing revellers home. Lo, now the ungentle time of slaughter comes, And horrid preparation frights the hour. The flashing knives upon the grinding disk Are held, with grating and discordant noise; And the great casks with scalding water smoke. Where oft the red-hot stone falls hissing, drowned. The muse, affrighted, flies the barbarous scene, And seeks elsewhere whatever rural sights Engage the autumn day. Beside the barn, Some break the brittle flax with swingle loud, And on the thorny hackle cleanse from tow; Some, where the full cribs like a sunset gleam, Shedding a golden lustre, shell the ears Of Indian corn preparing for the mill; Or thresh the buckwheat which on many a morn, When Boreas on the frosty panes shall breathe, Fresh from the griddle shall delight the board. And there the matron by her cottage door, With numerous wicks on slender twigs arranged, In melting caldrons gives the frequent dip, Preparing tapers for the winter's eve; Which then, suspended in the air to cool, Hang like the icicles at frozen roofs, That harden as the sinking sun departs. Now through the heavens the changing vapors fly, Driven by winds eccentric, threatening storm, While answering shadows sweep the stubbled land. Together smite the woodland's empty arms, While, with the last leaves, fall the latest nuts. Along the ground the rustling foliage whirls, Where oft the quail from out the sickled fields, Affrighted, comes, in kindred-colored drifts, To seek a rescue from the hunter's eye. And there the squirrel, with his pattering feet, Collects his winter store; or on a bough, The highest 'gainst the sky, with blowing bush, Sits swinging o'er the leafless world, amazed. At length the slanting, chill November rain Usurps the landscape wide, and with its handâ Agued and blue with penetrating coldâ Closes the slumberous barn. and every door, Most hospitable, shuts. BOOK NINETEENTH. The winter comes, Proclaimed by winds, and charioted by snows; And, like an Arctic voyager returned, His white furs breathing of the Norland frost, Tells of the frozen fields and mounts of ice Forever flaming in the boreal lights, Aflush with dawn-like hues which bring no day. Now the bright sun above a brighter worldâ A world as white as last month's perfect moonâ Looks all abroad, and on the jewelled trees, And icicles which taper at the eaves, Flashes his lavish splendor. Every stream Is deeply sealed beneath a frozen bridge, Where glides the glittering skate, with many a whirl, Scarring the polished floor. Afar and near The air is full of merriment and bells; And the swift sleigh, along the slippery road, Flies through the powdery mist which every gust Blows from the buried field. Here sweeps one past Muffled in generous skinsâthe bison's robe Spread largely, trailing in the sidelong drift. There timid Amy by her lover sits, Her soft cheek blushing at the winter's kiss. Anon, behold the temporary sledgeâ Built in the first joy of the earliest snowâ Which gives to rustic youths a thrill of pleasure Deeper than feels the Czar, encased in furs, 'Mid music swifter and more safely whirled. Down yonder hill, 'mid boyhood's ringing shouts, An avalanche of little sleds are shot, Streaking the air with laughter as they fly. There the tough snow-balls, hardened 'twixt the knees, Stream through the sun, with meteor-crossing lines, Till oft the winter coat is starred with white, The mark of skilful aim. Here one, perchance, Starts the small round, which gathers as it rolls, Until the giant pile half blocks the road; Or, at the wayside reared, takes human formâ A monster bulk, that, when the eve sets in, Shall fright the traveller with its ghostly shape, And start his steed aside. In yonder shed, Where rings the anvil with a bell-like sound, The Smith, while oft the share is in the coals, Leans on the polished handle of his sledge, And sees in visions, pleasing to his eye, The pictures which the floating rumors give Enticing to the West. And when the iron Flames on the stithy, like a rising sun, Driving the shadows into cobweb corners, The hammer takes new impulse from his armâ Imagination so possesses himâ And falls as 'twere the echo-waking axe, Swung by a pioneer in boundless woods. The Wheel wright, too, wields the curved, dangerous adze, And shapes the axle, as it were a beam Or rafter for the cabin, in his mind. The Masonâfor the frozen mortar now Refuses useâbeside the glowing fire Spreads his hard hands, and, gazing in the blaze, Startles the woodlands with his trowel's ring. The Cooper, at his shaving-horse astride, Draws the swift knife, and shapes the oaken stave As 'twere a shingle for his forest home. The Miller hears, amid the dusty meal, The mill-dam roaring at some unknown stream, And rears his pulpit in the distant wild. And in the grove the Woodman, 'mid his cords, Fells the primeval trunks. And e'en the Gunnerâ So powerful the infectious fever growsâ Strides, heedless of the rising flocks of quail; And, homeward turning, hangs the weapon up, Saving his charge for more important game. Now comes the warmer noon. The vanes swing round Before the south wind's soft and venturous wing. The breeze, like childhood in the shell-bark boughs, Shakes from the trees the rattling sleet; and now The eaves are pouring as with summer rain. Along the slushy roads the laboring sleigh, Returning, cuts into the softened earth. Grating discordant to the bells; the driver's face, Each melting moment falling with the thaw, Gives the long gauge of disappointed mirth. Then follows eve. The slanting sun descendsâ The snow grows crispâthe roofs withhold their rainâ And, like a proud man's mind, the icicle, Which had been spendthrift once, gives less and less, Until the last slow drop is held congealed, And the cold, miser point forbids approach. When o'er the western threshold goes the sun, Spreading his great hand through the crimson clouds, Shedding his benediction ere he leaves, Then dawns the eve around the social fire; From six to ten the nightly quiet glows, Soothing the household. Oh, how blest are they Who feel the calm that gilds the sacred hearth! To them, nor spring, nor summer's voiceful time, Hold music sweeter than is chanted there. From out the steaming logs the woodland sprites Sing, as they fly, a grateful song of peace; And crickets, full of harvest memories, In nook and crevice warm, rehearse their lays, Until the charmed and dreamy sense beholds The scented hay-fields, and the nodding sheaves; While Winter, like an uninvited guest, Stands at the hearth forgot. What though the moon, Through darkened chambers, pours her phantom snow, While all the stars, which ice the arch of heaven, Pierce the deep stillness with their splintered light;â Or though the clouds their fleecy fulness shed, Till farm with farm become one fenceless field, And fill the road, and roof the running brook, To oft mislead the wagoner and his team;â Though 'gainst the cottage piles the shifting snow, While at the sill the searching powder sifts;â Far from the blaze the deepening cold withdraws, And all grow tranquil as the tempest swells. Thus flames the hearth where Master Ethan sits, In dreamy trance, who, gazing at the blaze, Beholds Elijah's mounting wheels of fire; While, at his feet, the glowing grandchild, rapt, Pores o'er some magic page, or eager lists, With largening eyes, the reverend tongue discourse Of troublous days when War bestrode the land. On her low chair the dozing grandam knits, The needles moving when her eyes are closed, Till the dropped stitch requires the ready aid Of younger sight and hands. Still at her wheel Olivia dreams with misty, brooding eye, While flies the flax between her fingers warm, And on the spindle grows the oval spool. And there the larger wheel, whose whirring loud Makes through the house a tempest of its own, The matron drives; and, pacing forth and back, Smooths the white rolls that dwindle as they go. The easy farmer o'er the journal pours; Or, musing, clears the Western forest lands, And sows his harvest in the ashen field; Or drives his plough into the deep, rank soil Of boundless prairies stretching to the sky, Till fancy fills the crescent of his hope. No chilling sound disturbs the pleasing dream; In vain the winds besiege his stable-walls, Where, 'mid the well-filled racks, his cattle lie. And now, responsive to the village spire, The cock proclaims the hour, and all is well; While shadowy Time, who stands upon the stair, Lifts his clear voice, and points his warning hand. Anon, the flames in ashen depths expire, And none but crickets cheer the cooling hearth. Peace bars the doors, Content puts out the lamp, And Sleep fills up the residue of night. And still, as sounds the hour-announcing spire, The crowing cock makes answer, âAll is well!â BOOK TWENTIETH. Approaches now the time to Christians dear, Hallowed with grateful memories; the hour Which startled Herod on his throne, and drew The star-led Magi through the manger door, Where lay the infant Saviour of a world, More terrible to Eden's serpent vileâ Which now, affrighted, backward shrunk, chagrined, Coiling upon himselfâthan was the boy, The cradled Hercules, unto the snake He strangled in his grasp. This is the eve, Welcome to all, by childhood chiefly hailed, Bringing that day the angels ushered in O'er favored Bethlehem; and every house Is waked with joy, no pagan palace knew. Now to the hearth the Christmas log is rolled, Huge, unassailed by severing wedge and maul: Not the light pine, consuming in a day, Or loud explosive chestnut whose report Oft calls the housewife with her hurried broom; But hickory, solid, or, more common, oak, Whose knotted grain defies the splitting axe; Which, once arranged, behind the andirons glows, Devouring many a forelog, daily brought, Till New Year rolls another in its place. Behold where through the starry twilight air, Across the field, with crispy footfalls, walk Olivia and Amy, bearing each, From Baldwin's pantry, something for the dame Who in the lonely Oakland shadow dwells; While Master Ethan, in his ancient coat, Whose long skirts sweep the snow, strides on before, Bearing the fowlâno plumper crowds the roostâ To cheer the morrow's feast. Beside her door, Already, the rough wain has tracked the snow, And shed the winter cord; and on the sill The miller's frequent sack, to-day, was left. Oh, ye who sit in warm, penurious ease, Did ye but know the recompense which flows, Richer than gold, unto the heart that gives, Your very selfishness would master self, Till, on the coldest night of all the year, There should not be a hearth-stone unablaze, Or in a pantry want of wherewithal To bless the humble board, however poor! The door approached, the comfortable flame Gleams through unlisted crannies and the small Four panes which make a window; while above The cheerful smoke, shot through with frequent sparks, Mounts on the still cold air. A hasty glance They cast, and set their burthens down, and turn To leave; when at the door, with startling voice, The dame arrests them, crying, âFly not so! Stay yet awhile; for, knowing who ye are, I wot there are some thanks for me to pay. At least, fair damsels, let me pass my hand A moment o'er your own; and, in the dark, Perchance, I'll tell you something not amiss. Oh, here is joy!â she criesâthe while she draws Her bony finger o'er Olivia's palmâ âSo soon to come it needs no prophecy!â Then, taking Amy's shrinking hand in hers, With low, confiding voice she speaks:ââWhen times Have changed, and bring to you the need of friends, Beneath this humble roof one may you find. Here is a shelter where the tainted breath, The bad world loves to breathe, cannot invade: Cold slander points not at a couch like mine. This have the outcasts for their comfort; while That low and horrid shed must yet be built, Which hath not space enough for Peace to enter.â Thus having heard, they turn beyond the gate, And leave her murmuring to herself; and soon The farm-house takes them to its glowing arms. How swell the young hearts round the evening board, While spreads conjecture of the coming gifts! And soon the little stockings at the jamb Are hung, convenient, where the promised Saint, Through sooty entrance, shall descend unseen. Oh, thou brave, generous spirit, whose sure round Comes yearly, like the snowâSaint Nicholas, Or Santa Clausâor, in these sylvan vales, âKriss Kringleâ calledâof all the blessed saints, Which, as the legends say, revisit earth, I have chief faith in thee! For thou dost come, Noiseless and unobtrusive, to thy shrines, The Christmas hearths; and to thy votaries givest, And takest naught, save, at the early morn, The countless thanks, from youthful hearts of joy, Given in shouts profuse. In what strange form Thou comest is not known; but fancy deems Thy breast is swept with patriarchal beard, Thy silver locks encased in downy cap, Thy ample mantle of the softest furs, Native to Arctic climes; thy starry carâ Laden at Nuremberg's toy-crowded gablesâ A sleigh with silver runners, which through clouds Of snow unfallen, or the frosty dark, Flies drawn by spirits of a Lapland team, With shadowy antlers broad, whose many bells Are only heard in slumber's dreamy air. Thus wilt thou come to-night; and, with the dawn, Whether thou stayest to hear, or fliest afar, To shade thy head a twelvemonth in thy realmâ Withdrawn, unknownâthe happiest laughing voice, Sincerest of the year, shall swell with praise And gratitude to thy mysterious name. Along the valley winds the coachman's horn, Announcing his approach; and while his steeds Are led to stable, steaming as they go, And fresher are brought out, one traveller Alights, and straightway, favored by the moon, Takes the near path across, through field and grove, And on the hill, which gives the vale to sight, Stands for a moment, breathless with his joy, His shadow, like his fancy, streaming far And swiftly in advance, along the snow. Full twice his wonted height the figure seems Above his shade; while all his stately frame Is glowing, throbbing with a new delight. The landscape swims, confused, in manly tears; The cottage lights, like wisps, unsteady shine, Wavering, uncertain, as his steps renew. Swiftly he glides, recalling every spot Which sideway meets his eye; but still his gaze Upon one lighted window firmly holds. Now hath he neared the gate; and, trembling now, Steals slowly to the door, while sounds within The boisterous laugh of children. When this fades, His heart so loudly thunders in his brain, He cannot catch the voice he most would hear. His hand is at the latch; but, ere it lifts, The door, as by a spirit oped, swings wide, And all the brightness of the light within Falls on his noble form; and, like a ghost, Breathless, Olivia before him stands. The taper drops from out her loosened grasp; She calls his name, and swoons into his arms; And all the household echoes, âArthur! Arthur!â How speed the hours between those happy hearts! What welcomes sweet! what fluent interchange Of all which filled their separated past! Ne'er were two dwellings waked with deeper joy, Than are to-night the homes of the betrothed; So deep that Sleep, admiring, stands withdrawn, Listening unseen beneath the midnight arch The morrow comes, and every neighboring house Is filled with gladness at the welcome newsâ So much is Arthur held in their esteem. And invitations, set for different nights, Soon fill the coming week; where the full board Is spread, with honor to the housewife's skill, And choicest cider-casks are bid to flow, While fruits and nuts go round. There, every eve The favored lovers lead the country reel, Where Envy, pale, abashed at her own voice, Shrinks from the door to more ambitious halls. And there, the frequent centre of a group, The happy traveller, glowing with his theme, Repeats the wonders of the sea or land, Spreading, to the undoubting, marvelling eye, The pictures which his rapid language paints, Till many a listener takes his pack and staff, Sailing imaginary seas, to climb The visionary Alp, or stride the plain Where history's various-colored tents are pitched. BOOK TWENTY-FIRST. The winter speeds; yet, ere the spring comes in, On many a tree which at the cross-roads stands, And at the village tavern and the store, And on the blacksmith's wallâin staring print, Or in coarse written linesâunnumbered bills Proclaim the dissolution near at hand. There the choice farm and stock, or household wares, Are offered, and the day of vendue set; And, ere from off the fields the last snow melts From crops, another than the hand which sowed Shall in the harvest reap. The sales begin; While Melancholy walks from door to door, And with strange pleasure holds divided sway. Already the great wains, with produce filled, Have groaned their way unto the distant mart, And in return brought back such various stores As the long journey needsâthe rifle, axe, And ammunition for defence and game; While evening oft beholds around the hearth, As in those days when war convulsed the land, The molten lead run into moulded balls, Till every pouch is full, and, with the horn, Hangs waiting on the wall. At many a door The new-bought wagon, with its cover white, Stands with the long tongue ready for the team. From house to house the auction goes by turns; While flock the people in from miles around, And bear at eve, well pleased, the purchase home. Thus oft the household goods, as to the winds Blowing from fitful quarters, fly afar, Like severed families, to meet no more; And oft the sad wife, gazing where they go, Needs dry the starting tear. The sales proceed; The various round is wellnigh done; and now To Baldwin's dwelling comes the fatal day. From loft to cellar, all the staid old house Is made to pour its contents to the yard, Until the feet most native to the stairs Wake but a hollow, uncongenial sound, Saddening, sepulchralâuntil each heart feels As if the stranger, at the outer door, Stood waiting with his wares. The brown old clock, Slender and tall, with curious antique face. Which stood for threescore years with hourly tongue, Warning and cheeringâor, if none would hear, Like childish age, still garruling to itselfâ Now passes silent through the mournful door, Borne, carefully, foot first. The faithful wheels Which, like the cat with purring voice of peace, Sang as the flax from off the distaffs ran, The mothers and the daughters stand outside, Whirling to idle hands. The bureau old, With deep and odorous drawers, where oft the rose Scattered its leaves to scent the snow-white robes, Is lightly thrummed upon, with careless fingers, Or peered into, with calculating eyes, Measuring its worth. And there the mirror tall, Which now hath ta'en farewell of well-known forms, Reflects the stranger and the bustling scene. See, how the crier's hard, unpitying look Gloats o'er the medley mass, while all draw near! Swift as a rattle flies his marvellous tongue, While his quick eye from face to face darts round, Catching the nod ere full consent approves. And the rough joke, which wakes the crowd to mirth, Adds a fresh blow unto the aching hearts Of those who, piecemeal, see their home destroyed, Part after part, as rafters to a flame, With sound of desolation, falling in. Among the heirlooms, note the aged pair, Downcast as at a funeral, move about With nervous stealth, taking a sad farewell Of many a dumb old friend. The palsied dame Among the curious children, shuffling, goes From room to room, with wondering mournful eyes; Or on the last chair, by the starving hearth, Crouches, and gazes in the cheerless fire. And Master Ethan, stifling many a sigh, Affects the cheerful, and sets out the ware; The while the matron, favoring the move, Stirs chief amid the scene; and, frequent, chides The tear upon Olivia's cheek, yet oft, With hasty apron, clears her own blurred gaze. The day goes by; the evening quiet comes, Where sadness half-way dims their one poor light, Until, to such rough temporary beds As haste and need can make, they seek repose: Some dreaming of the past, and some Of the to-morrow's busy sceneâof ties Soon to be broken, and no more renewed; While Fancy oft, before the expedition, Flies like the horizon, and in forest depths Pitches the evening tent. The starting-morn, Full of bright sunshine, bursts upon the vale; But in the broken homeâtheir home no moreâ A stranger foot hath passed, and led one hence, Without a breath announcing to the air His coming or departure; and the house, From Master Ethan to the youngest there, Is shadowed with a sudden gust of grief. There lies the grandam, placid as in sleep, Where she shall wake no more. The weary soul Hath left its time-worn tenement of earth, Shaking the dust from off its pilgrim feet Against a sinful world, and passed to heaven The news is spread, and all the wagons wait. A few swift days fly o'er the dreary vale; And, for the last time, to the chapel-yard The pastor turns his steps, where follow, soon, The mournful train. And now the grave is filled; The last sad mound is shaped, as 'twere a seal Signing the separation made in peace, Or monument to the departing hour. BOOK TWENTY-SECOND. Here, by the highway, let us stand and note The long, slow, laboring caravan which takes, To-day, its westward course. Like moving tents, The laden wagons pass. Along the road Some, who remain, collect in wayside groups, And wave the kerchief, uttering heartfelt words Of cheer; some join the pilgrimage a space, Walking behind the wains in converse meet, Speeding the adventurers on. Some, in advance, Who started earlier on the way, with gaze Cast frequent back, and leisure, mournful steps, Hold melancholy talk with those whom they Perchance shall see no more. Saddest of these, Young Amy, leaning on her lover, walks, Her tears usurping all her powers of speech; While he, as voluble as spring-time brooks, Pours in her ear the promise which her hope Gathers and holds in its securest depths. A few short weeks will soon go by, and then His steps shall follow to their forest home, Where thought of separation shall no more Affright her tender soul. With words like these He drowns, at last, the saddest of her fears. On yonder height, where forks the woodland road, And the old finger-boards with letters pale, Long washed by storms, direct diverging ways, The school-house stands, where Master Ethan taught, Now silent as a bee-deserted hive; the shutters closed, As on a room of death, while chain and lock Make the lone door secure. There, on her cane, Beneath the hand-post, stands the Oakland dame, Watching the winding line with curious eye. When Amy passes, she exalts her voice, Waving a caution-finger as she speaks: âRemember, lass, the words of Christmas eve!â And, suddenly, across the young girl's heart Flashes the whole sad sentence she then heard. Loud laughs the youth, and bids her hold her peace; And Amy, trembling as they pass her by, Hastens her onward steps. Next, following, come Olivia and Arthur; after these, Frail Master Ethan, with his pilgrim cane, Leading the wondering grandchild by the hand; Then, next, the wagons. First, the well-shod team Bearing the blacksmith's household; following this, The wheelwright, full of magisterial pomp, Directs his steeds, holding himself the centre And spring of all the movement,âone of those, Chancing in front, who arrogate the lead; Or, in the rear, is driverânothing less. Adverse or fair, the world from one proud point Is viewed and met: if good, it is his dueâ If ill, another's fault; yet ne'er so bad, But that the saddest half, by skill of his, Is headed and turned off. The ridden world Bears many such; and oft obeys the reins, Which arrogance usurps with shameless hand, While modest wisdom stands aside, abashed. There, next, the mason and the cooper come, Their wives and children from the crowded wain Peering abroad, with eyes half smiles and tears; And, in communion close, the parson's team And Baldwin's bring the rear. Anon they gain The summit of the height, and turn to gaze; And, gazing, heave the sigh, and breathe adieu, While many a rough hand feels the farewell grasp. At length the long leave-taking is all o'er; The train descends; and, lo, the happy vale Is closed from sight beyond the mournful hill, And all the West, before the onward troop, Lies in the far unknown. As goes a bride, With pain and joy alternate in her breast, To find a home within the alien walls Of him who hath enticed her henceâher heart More hoping than misgivingâso, to-day, Departed the slow train; and now the miles, Gliding beneath with gradual but sure pace, Bring them at last to unfamiliar scenes. Thoughtful they hold their onward, plodding course, Each in his own reflection wrapt; for now, With every step, some ancient tie is broke, Some dream relinquished, or some friend given up: While old associations spring, self-called, Even as tears, unbidden. Thus, awhile, They keep the silent tenor of their way; Till, like a sudden, unexpected bird Which from the still fields soars into the air, Flooding the noon with melody, up swells The gladsome voice of Arthur into song, Cheering the drooping line:â âBid adieu to the homestead, adieu to the vale, Though the memory recalls them, give grief to the gale: There the hearths are unlighted, the embers are black, Where the feet of the onward shall never turn back. For as well might the stream that comes down from the mount, Glancing up, heave the sigh to return to its fount; Yet the lordly Ohio feels joy in his breast As he follows the sun onward into the West. âThere the great inland seas wash their measureless shores, The voice of whose grandeur Niagara pours; There the wide prairie rolls, a deep ocean, away Where the bison toss through in leviathan play; Or oft pours through autumn a deluge of fire, Where the herds fly, like demons, in fear and in ire. At the noon or the midnight, in tempest or rest, The sublime hath its realm in the land of the West. âOh, to roam, like the rivers, through empires of woods, Where the king of the eagles in majesty broods; Or to ride the wild horse o'er the boundless domain, And to drag the wild buffalo down to the plain; There to chase the fleet stag, and to track the huge bear, And to face the lithe panther at bay in his lair, Are a joy which alone cheers the pioneer's breast, For the only true hunting-ground lies in the West! âLeave the tears to the maiden, the fears to the child, While the future stands beckoning afar in the wild; For there Freedom, more fair, walks the primeval land, Where the wild deer all court the caress of her hand. There the deep forests fall, and the old shadows fly, And the palace and temple leap into the sky. Oh, the East holds no place where the onward can rest, And alone there is room in the land of the West!â Thus swelled the song, and cheerfulness at last, With the new scene, possessed the flying hour. And when the evening, like a toll-man gray, Drops his dusk bar across the winding road, Before the dull, secluded wayside inn, The laden wains collect, where tired teams Hear the loud-creaking pump, and rustling hay Which from the near mow rolls, or dusty oats Poured into troughs, and heave the hungry neigh. Around the evening hearth the cheerful groups Collect; and, in the novel hour, forget Their various regrets and their fatigues, While jest and laugh go round. Alone withdrawn, The mournful Amy by Olivia sits; And, on the willing shoulder of her friend, Leans her sad head, and pours her heart of grief, Mingled with hope, to the confiding breast Which, having known a kindred pain, can feel, And, feeling, give its depth of sympathy. How beautiful is innocence which, thus, To innocence consigns its deepest thought!â How pure! how angel-like! A sacred scene, Which, to the brow of cold, suspecting manâ They most suspicious who betrayâshould start The color, given by the sudden blow Of self-reproach, upon the scoundrel front. BOOK TWENTY-THIRD. Another morning finds them on their way: Another still, and still another, flies. To-day beside the Susquehanna leads Their road romantic; and to-day the sun, Looking betwixt the hill-tops to the vales, Beholds, with cheerful eye, the climbing line Which by the roaring Juniata winds; Till, lo! upon the windy mountain height, While glows the eve above a sea of hills. Flushing the Alleghanian peaks, the train Hangs like a cloud that, with the coming day, Beside the brook which takes a westward course Shall hold its far descent. Here, from the road, They turn into the woods beneath the pines, And, 'mid the budding laurels, pitch their camp. The wains, together in close circle drawn, Give shelter to the steeds that feed within. At once, in noisy groups, all hands collect The dry dead branches and the resinous cones, And build the fire, and hew the stakes and crane; While Master Ethan, fathoming his pouch, Draws out the line, and Arthur trims the rod, And soon along the wild, tumultuous brook The bait is swept; and oft, as to the eddy It whirls, 'mid spray and foam, the mountain trout Flickers in air its constellated sides To eke the evening meal. The camp-fire springs, And the red day fades out, and leaves the sky To the cold April moon and starsâthe moon, As Ceres' sickle, thin, and sharp, and bright. Behold where glide the dusk forms to and fro Before the crackling blaze, their shadows far Reaching among the pines! Throughout the night The hungry fire is fed by those who hold, By turns, the dreary watchâa foretaste this Of many a night to come, in gloomy depths Of wilderness, far, unknown. Strange sounds Are floating on the gusty air; the boughs, In wavy motion, make continuous noise As of a mighty river roaring by; While, as night deepens, louder brawl the brooks, Flashing their spectral light among the rocks: One sweeping east, unto the Chesapeakeâ One west, to Mississippi and the Gulf. To such inhospitable heights as this, Where the thin air unto the palest cheek Sends the quick blood, the fancy deems that Sleep Would scarcely come, or, coming, stay not long; But now in many a tented wain she sits, Soothing the fallen lid with murmurous sounds, Despite the young, capricious imp of dreams, Who half-way mars her choicest task. The watch Of middle night is Arthur's: when his form Stands tall and brave against the steadfast blaze, One other figure steals unto his side, And, 'gainst persuasion, shares the starry hour; For Love, more sure than sleep, attends the course Of whosoever once hath harbored him. Where'er they look, the black and pillared pines Sway to and fro, as if some giant arm, Like Samson's, rocked them to their fall; and yet The tempest, in his oft accustomed track, Sits, like a hunter 'mid his leash of hounds, Resting, uncertain where to bend his steps. The moon, above the shadowy mountain lines, Drops its increasing crescent, where the hope Of those two hearts as one together glides, To round and brighten in the distant West. Dear, as a new star to the wakeful eye Of one who, on a midnight tower, keeps watch, Is scene like this unto the tuneful muse: The maid all tenderness and trust, and rich With sympathies which time alone can show; The other boundless in his guardian love, Which colors even his most ambitious dream;â A noble nature, full of great desires, And whom the well-pleased future shall behold A leader 'mid his people. Night departs; The stars withdraw behind a veil of light, To gild in other worlds the evening sky, While morning rules in this. When now the sun, Like a swift diver 'neath a vessel's keel, Hath swept the nether space, and all aglow Exalts his shining forehead in the eastâ Laying his level arms across the hillsâ Gazing, delighted, where he climbs, refreshedâ The white train, like a bank of spring-time snow Loosened by warmth, glides slowly down along The steep and melting roads; while constant care Scarce shuns the dread abyss which yawns beside The freezing depths where, half the summer through, Some straggling follower of winter rests, Lodged in his sheltered tent of sunless snow. Still by their side, companioning their way, The embryo riverâhere a gust of foam Which the deer leaps, and hunter, undismayed, Seizing a rough branch, followsâheadlong flies. Days come and close; and, with another eve, Against the sky their ken discerns, well pleased, The swinging cloud, starred through with meteor sparks, Which, hourly, o'er the Iron City floats, Announcing where the loud and laboring forge And furnace flame, continuous, throb and glow. And when within the hospitable yards Of well-stored inns the teams are led ungeared, And matrons, maids, and children, round the fire, Thaw out the memory of the mountain cold, The men and youths, adventurous, sally forth, And seek the red mouth of the furnace broad, Where flows the iron into smoking moulds; Or stand, admiring, where the hammer huge Falls on the white-hot metal, at each blow Filling the space with sudden rain of fire; Or how the hungry rollers take the mass, And yield, at length, the long and slender bars. Here Barton stands, as native to the scene, And feels the impulse of his noble craft Thrill to his fingers, with a fond desire To grasp the bar and sledge. The morning comes: Behold where noisy builders by the stream, With axe and adze, construct the future arks, To sweep the Ohio to its mouth, and take The Mississippi, in its swift career, Wide-winding 'twixt the boundaries of States As lesser streams 'twixt farms. Here, on this beam, The fresh-hewn poplar, which among its fellows Sweetens the air with odors, till it floats Enamored in the sun as o'er a garden, Let us sit down, unstartledâsit and hear The song of Labor, whose resounding blow Sounds like a voice proclaiming to the future The march of this, our forward-going age. The song of Labor! nobler song is not! He is the bard who writes, in living acts, The epic of the era; every stroke A word prophetic of the great hereafter. Observe this group of workmen who prepare The beams and boards, and clear the ample space, To shape the flat-boat's square, ungraceful form. Some line and score, and with the broadaxe hew The giant log; and then the whip-saw comes, Long, slender, biting as a champion's sword, And double-handled, manned at either end, One on the upreared trunk and one beneath! See how the swift blade, as the lightning, flies, Severing, like death, what time can never join! Thus separated, and the ends aslope Hewn equal, like the runners of a sleighâ Huge as a Northern army might desire, To bear provisions for a winter campâ They upturned lie; and now the oaken planks Reach crosswise, pinned and spiked from end to end. Then, with dull chisel, and the noisy mallet, The swingling tow is driven into the seams, Till all are calked, and comes the black cement Of molten odorous pitch, which gives secure Protection 'gainst invasion of the wave. Anon, the monster hull, by levers reared, Heaves a great vault in air, and, righted thus, Lies ready for the launch. The rails are laid, And to the slippery slope the boat is given; And, lo! the wooden avalanche descends Sheer to the middle of the stream, to be Recalled by checking cables. As it strikes, One, 'mid loud shouts from the resounding shore, Breaks on the bow the deep baptismal flask; And let our hopes with his be freely joined, With heartfelt prayers that fair Prosperity May spread her pinions o'er the sailless ark; For this the deck which Providence ordains To bear our travellers hence. A few swift days Go by: the boat is covered, and complete Within and out. On either side the oars, And one astern, from ashen sapling hewnâ Each suppled, toughened many seasons through In sweeping rivers of the mountain windâ Droop, like unfolded wings half spread for flight. And now, in groups, unto the crowded wharf The various households gather with their wares, And soon betake them to their floating home; And, drawn in close assemblies on the deck, Gaze, wondering, at the tumult which they leave; Bidding adieu to Pennsylvanian shores, Which few, of all the crowd, shall tread again. When, suddenly, a well-known voice is heard, And all, delighted, hearken as it swells:â âLo, our waiting ark is freighted; In its depths of oak and pine All our household gods are gatheredâ Thine, my noble friend, and thine! âHere the laughter-loving children Gaze, with wonder-filling eyes, With the maidens whose emotions, Like the waters, fall and rise. âHere are youths whose westward fancies Chase the forest-sheltered game; Here are men with soul and sinew Which no wilderness can tame. âHere are matrons full of courageâ Worthy these the pioneersâ And the patriarch lends a sanction In the wisdom of his years. âAxe and team, and plough and sickle, In the hold are gathered all; And methinks I hear the woodlands, 'Mid their thundering echoes, fall, âAnd behold the great logs blazing, Till the ashen fields are bare, And a boundless harvest springingâ The response of toil and prayer! âDraw the foot-board, loose the cables, Free the wharf, and man the oars; Give the broad keel to the river, Bid adieu to crowded shores: âWharves where Europe's venturous exiles Throng with all their hopes and caresâ Sires of future States of freemen, Standing 'mid their waiting wares. âBid adieu the Iron City, With its everlasting roar Whose Niagara of traffic Flows to westward evermore, âWhere the cloud swings into heaven, And the furnace-flames disgorge, With the multitudinous clamor Of the factory and the forge. âIn yon mountains, like the eagles, Brood the rivers at their springs, Then descend, with sudden swooping, On their far and flashing wings. âHere the dashing Alleghany And Monongahela meet, And a moment whirl and dally Round the city's crowded feet; âTill, anon, with wedded pinions, How they sweep the shores as one, Driving westward, ever westward, In the pathway of the sun. âLike a cloud upon the storm-wind, Now our heaving ark careers; Or some great bridge which a freshet Bears in triumph from its piers. âDown we sweep; and yonder steamer Smoking round the distant hill, With its swift wheel flashing splendor, Like the loud wheel of a mill, âShall not fright us, though the waters Sweep our deck with foamy force, While the angel of Adventure, With true courage, guides our course. âAnd the river, like our purpose, Brooks no voice which bids it wait, Bearing onward, ever onward, Where the forest opes its gate; âOpes the gate that hung for ages, Rusting in its old repose, Which, once swung upon its hinges, There's no giant hand can close. âFar beyond that ancient portal We will pitch our camp, nor rest Till from out our forest cabins Spring the homesteads of the West.â BOOK TWENTY-FIFTH. Between the hills whose perforated sides Bleed to the watered banks, from veins of coal, The black bituminous mass, for days they float Delighted with the changing view. The shore, On either hand, a lovely landscape glides: And Beaver past, lo, presently appear The fields of other States. Here, on the left, Virginia, whose historic name recalls The scenes of chivalry and old romanceâ A State which lavished heroes, as a mountain Gives to the land its rivers. The broad home Of Raleigh's hope and Pocahontas' love, Of Washington and Jefferson, and him Who, 'midst the cry of âtreason,â shook the world, Till Tyranny, with all his traitor band, Apace recoiled as billows to the blast. There on the right, behold, more newly freed From the grim forest's grasp, the lovely land Christened in honor of the stream which bears The produce of her fruitful farms afar. The time arrives when labor's iron doors Are closed upon the tumult of the week, Secure, as evening shuts behind the day; And, when the silent hour is ushered in, A dusky island on the river looms, Brooding above its shadow, like a cloud Bereft of all the windsâcompanionless, It hangs suspended o'er the inverted sky, Concealing half the river stars. And here The heavy ark unto the sheltering shore Glides noiseless, as an eagle swooping in To rest beneath the overarching limbs, And soon the cables hold it to the bank Among the watery willows. In the east, As red and wide as is the forge's mouth Oft seen 'mid Alleghanian hills, the moonâ Like some great soul, aflush with earthly lusts, That nobly rises from its base estateâ Ascends, each moment lessening from the stain, Until the heavens receive it pure and white. Invited by her ray, unto the shore The lovers wander through the sinuous paths, In happy freedom from the crowded deck, And Arthur to Olivia repeats The saddening tale of Blennerhasset's isle:â âOnce came an exile, longing to be free, Born in the greenest island of the sea; He sought out this, the fairest blooming isle That ever gemmed a river; and its smile, Of summer green and freedom, on his heart Fell, like the light of Paradise. Apart It lay, remote and wild; and in his breast He fancied this an island of the blest; And here he deemed the world might never mar The tranquil air with its molesting jar. Long had his soul, among the strife of men, Gone out and fought, and, fighting, failed; and then Withdrew into itself; as when some fount Finds space within, and will no longer mount, Content to hear its own secluded waves Make lonely music in the new-found caves. And here he brought his household; here his wife, As happy as her children, round his life Sang as she were an echo, or a part, Of the deep pleasure springing in his heartâ A silken string which with the heavier cord Made music, such as well-strung harps afford. She was the embodied spirit of the man, His second self, but on a fairer plan. And here they came, and here they built their home, And set the rose, and taught the vines to roam, Until the place became an isle of bowers, Where odors, mist-like, swam above the flowers. It was a place where one might lie and dream, And see the naiads, from the river-stream, Stealing among the umbrous, drooping limbs; Where Zephyr, 'mid the willows, tuned her hymns Round rippling shores. Here would the first birds throng, In early spring-time, and their latest song Was given in autumn; when all else had fled, They half forgot to go, such beauty here was spread. It was, in sooth, a fair enchanted isle, Round which the unbroken forest, many a mile, Reached the horizon like a boundless sea;â A sea whose waves, at last, were forced to flee On either hand, before the westward host, To meet no more upon its ancient coast. But all things fair, save truth, are frail and doomed; And brightest beauty is the first consumed By envious Time; as if he crowned the brow With loveliest flowers, before he gave the blow Which laid the victim on the hungry shrine:â Such was the dreamer's fate, and such, bright isle, was thine. There came the stranger, heralded by fame. Whose eloquent soul was like a tongue of flame, Which brightened and despoiled whate'er it touched. A violet, by an iron gauntlet clutched, Were not more doomed than whosoe'er he won To list his plans, with glowing words o'errun: And Blennerhasset hearkened as he planned. âFar in the South there was a glorious land, Crowned with perpetual flowers, and where repute Pictured the gold more plenteous than the fruitâ The Persia of the West. There would he steer His conquering course, and o'er the bright land rear His far-usurping banner, till his home Should rest beneath a wide, imperial dome, Where License, round his thronÃ©d feet, should whirl Her dizzy mazes like an orient girl. His followers should be lords; their ladies each Wear wreaths of gems beyond the Old World's reach; And emperors, gazing to that land of bloom, With impotent fire of envy should consume. Such was the gorgeous vision which he drew. The listener saw; and, dazzled by the viewâ As one in some enchanter's misty room, His senses poisoned by the strange perfume, Beholds with fierce desire the picture fair, And grasps at nothing in the painted airâ Gave acquiescence, in a fatal hour, And wealth, and hope, and peace were in the tempter's power. The isle became a rendezvous; and then Came in the noisy rule of lawless men. Domestic calm, affrighted, fled afar, And Riot revelled 'neath the midnight star. Continuous music rustled through the trees, Where banners danced responsive on the breeze; Or in festoons, above the astonished bowers, With flaming colors shamed the modest flowers. There clanged the mimic combat of the sword, Like daily glasses round the festive board; Here lounged the chiefs, there marched the plumÃ©d file, And martial splendor overrun the isle. Already, the shrewd leader of the sport The shadowy sceptre grasped, and swayed his court. In dreams or waking, revelling or alone, Before him swam the visionary throne; Until a voice, as if the insulted woods Had risen to claim their ancient solitudes, Broke on his spirit, like a trumpet rude, Shattering his dream to nothing where he stood! The revellers vanished, and the banners fell, Like the red leaves beneath November's spell. Full of great hopes, sustained by mighty will, Urged by ambition, confident of skill, As fearless to perform as to devise, Aflush, but now he saw the glittering prize Flame like a cloud in day's descending track; But, lo, the sun went down, and left it black! Alone, despised, defiance in his eye, He heard the shout, and âtreason!â was the cry; And that harsh word, with its unpitying blight, Swept o'er the island like an Arctic night. Cold grew the hearth-stone, withered fell the flowers, And desolation walked among the bowers. âThis was the mansion. Through the ruined hall The loud winds sweep, with gusty rise and fall, Or glide, like phantoms, through the open doors; And winter drifts his snow along the floors, Blown through the yawning rafters, where the stars And moon look in as through dull prison-bars. On yonder gable, through the nightly dark, The owl replies unto the dreary bark Of lonely fox, beside the grass-grown sill; And here, on summer eves, the whippoorwill Exalts her voice, and to the traveller's ear Proclaims how Ruin rules with full contentment here.â BOOK TWENTY-SIXTH. Thus sang the poet-lover, 'mid the scenes Where happiness once brooded like a dove. The mournful tale is ended with a sigh, And she who listened weeps; and where they stand The sad moon ponders, like the ghost of Eve All night a-gazing on an Eden lost. The conjuring fancy fills the place with shapes, Holding their doubtful tryst; the o'ershadowed eye Peoples the dusk with phantoms; and the ear, By keen imagination finely tuned, Like a light cord to fullest tension drawn, Vibrates to each accordant sigh of air, And hears a world of sounds, where ruder sense Would only note the silence. Did you hear? Was it a rustle in the budding boughs, Or lone bird darting from his wakeful branch? Did you not see?âThere, through the light, and there! Was it a spirit swept across their path? And hark again! a sound as of a wave, Weary of rolling to a pitiless wind, Dashing its tired breast against a rock! Near by, the river reels around a point, Sweeping from darkness into sudden lightâ So near, the lovers' slanting shadows glide, Bending together, o'er the dreamy bank. An instant Arthur gazes on the stream, And bounds aside, and leaps into the flood, And bears a dripping figure to the shore; While, like a marble wonder, speechless stands The pale Olivia: even as one in sleep, Who fain would follow while the feet, enchained, Refuse their wonted office. On his arm The deluged form, with loosened, oozing locks, Hangs, like a sea-nymph, fainting; from her face, Which to the moon's astonishment gives back A look of pallid sorrow, the hair smoothed, Displays the well-known features of their friend. Olivia, frighted, bends above the form, And calls her, âAmy! Amy!â till the ear, Dulled with the water, hears, and the sad eyes, Bewildered, ope, as if to meet the shapes And scenes of other worldsâamazed, confused, Uncertain if an angel speaks her name, Or if a spirit bears her soul released. Conscious, at last, she clasps her bosom-friend, And sighs, âForgive, forgive!â Sad heart, she feels The weight of crime attempted, yet scarce knowsâ So tangled, like a delicate web, her brainâ 'Gainst whom or what! But e'er the night is o'er, While sits Olivia by the cabin couch, The sole receiver of her inmost thoughtâ In concert to the under-going stream Which, like the river of death, flows darkly nearâ She pours upon the sympathizing breast Her deep heart-drowning sorrow and her fears; And both, together, weep the long night through, Or pray in union while their comrades sleep. Oh, Heaven, if e'er thy pitying angel stoops, As holiest faith believes, and in the hour Of fear and pain breathes his consoling voice, Like sounds of waters water to the ear of one Who droops in deserts loneâin this sad place Permit his wings to fold beside the couch, And bid him shed into the fainting soul The holy calm whence courage only springs! The world is full of sadness: oft the smile Is but the flower, above decaying hopes, Blooming to hide a ruin. But a sight Saddest of allâsadder than sudden deathâ It is to see a young heart touched with frost, And all its freshness scattered to the wind;â A heart which had been full of joy, all hope, All love, all trust, break from its hold of all, And, like an easy, noiseless bank of sand, Fall, crumbling by continuous degrees, Into the gulfy river of despair. BOOK TWENTY-SEVENTH. Adieu the island! Lo, the Sabbath dawns, A cloudless April day. Still toward the West The broad stream bears them onward in its arms. On either shore, and through the neighboring fields, While sounds the bell from yonder village spire, The unknown people throng. Then to the deck The various inmates of the ark collect, And round the pastor drawn, in pious groups, Flood the calm air with the melodious hymn; While, as they pass the town, an answer comes, Like a clear echo, from the hill-side church. The melody into their hearts descendsâ The old familiar tuneâtill every breast Is waked to joy, and even the sternest eye Is moistened with a sympathizing mist. How beautiful, in such an hour and place, To hear from stranger lips unseen, perchance That never may be seen till met in heaven, The sacred sounds proclaiming brotherhoodâ The masonry of souls! How beautiful! In all the world of artâa wondrous worldâ I know no picture lovelier than to-day Melts o'er my vision. Chief amid the groupâ A dwindled portion of his former flockâ Each face familiar, all, as children, dearâ The pastor stands, and on his loving arm Holds the great volume, and, with sunburnt hand, Turns o'er the intimate leaves. Ope where he will, The broad page greets him like a well-known friend. Near by, with white hair stirring to the breeze, Frail Master Ethan, leaning on his cane, Stands hat in hand. The matrons, on the deck, Sit with the children at their careful sides; There youths and maids respectful posture hold; And every man draws near, save those who lean And listen at the easy-moving oars. Suns rise and set, and still the boat glides on; Peace rules the day, and music cheers the eve. Lo, on the south extends the lovely land Where strode the solitary man of old, Bursting upon the entangled night of woods, Like prophecy, proclaiming where he went The forest's fall, and the red man's decline! Here the lone Nimrod of the pathless West Reigned with his rifle, and, through hostile wilds, Won to himself an empire undisturbed. His nights o'erhung with royal tents of boughs, His vernal board with venison was crowned, His cup with coolest crystal from the rocks; And oft unto his morning throne of stateâ A crag which overbrowed the stateliest woodsâ He mounted, and surveyed his wide domain, Deciding where to bend his further sway. Behind him, like the murmuring of the sea Which, to a constant wind, invades the shore, He heard the encroaching tumult of the world; And, with the sun, strode on a few swift miles, Usurping, westward, what he eastward lost. Such was the realm of Boone, the pioneer, If it is not taking too much liberty, I would suggest that Kentucky might also find a niche in her capitol for a statue of the father of her State. It is a subject which her own sculptor, Mr. Hart, would treat with propriety and enthusiasm. Whose statue, in the eternal niche of fame, Leans on his gleaming rifle; and whose name Is carved so deep in the Kentuckian rocks, It may not be effaced. His glorious soul, Heroic among kindred hero souls, Now threads the boundless forest of the stars; While still his memory, like a spirit, walks With living influence in his favorite land. What means this sudden swelling of the stream, As if a thousand springs within its depths Had burst, like mighty geysers, to exalt The river's watery head, that, rising, roars, And frights the banks until they swoon and drown? Answer, ye nymphs, from out your turbid caves! For nymphs there are in this unclassic flood, Born of the savage muse in vanished years, Who peopled all the solitude with shapes, Whose spiritual whispers in the wind, The waters, and the woods, still charm the ear. A poesy, unwritten, floats abroad, So wide dispread, the echo-waking axe Shall not dispel it; nor the busy plough Turn it beneath the furrows; nor the train, Thundering along its iron way, affright; Nor smoking barges, with their flashing wheels, Dislodge it from the waters. Every brook And tree, could we but comprehend the song, Is musical with voices not its own; An influence of the primal time still lives, And breathes, and moulds us in our daily walks, And thus develops in us, unaware, A something of the earliest things which were. 'Tis this which links us with the perfect plan, The chain which was, and is, and is to be. Even where I gaze, the fancy, in the stream, Pictures dim, liquid shapes which rise and sink, And sway in waves that ripple to the shore, Intoxicate in the redundant flood. There curved an arm, and there a bright face laughed, With momentary eyes and lips disclosed, And sound of sinless kisses thrown, perchance, From watery fingers to the youths on deck. There swim the children of the Indian muse, Who ply at night the shadowy canoe, While kindred forms, along the moonlit woods, Startle the phantom deer and wake the chase, From whence their sires have goneâforever gone. The man has fled, the spirit still remainsâ The substance less substantial than the shade. And still the river's sullied waters swell, Augmented by the melting mountain snows And plenteous April rains. Afar and near, The swift-careering drift chaotic flies, Borne on the thievish shoulders of the flood; Great trees, whirled ruthless from their native banks, Sweep headlong, with their budding limbs all drowned, And roots fantastic raking through the air. These are the shapes that in the channel depths Of Mississippi lodgeâthe downward prongs Mining the sandy bedâthe dreadful trunk Swaying aslant to gore the freighted ark. Here float the logs of some disjointed raft, And there the woodman's scattered cords! Enough Swims prodigal to build a nation's navy. At such a time as this, the wary crew Must needs, with well-manned oars, avoid the drift, While many a danger lies engulfed, unseen. And when the night comes on, as now it comes, And threatening clouds impend from east to west, While all the watery shore no harbor gives, With what misgivings, doubting hopes and fears, The venturous watchers ride into the dark, Where Providence assumes the swaying helm! Loud sweeps the torrent; but with louder voice Roars on the shoreless ocean of the wind, Bearing the dusky navies of the storm, Whose signal cannons, flashing, threat the land. Along the hills gleam scattered cottage-lights, Mocking the homeless households where they float, Compassed with dangers which the starless night, With cruel kindness, veils. The startled sense, For every peril hid, beholds, thrice told, The horror painted on the blackened air; While oft the fancy, drowning with the wreck, Dies momentary deaths. The grinding drifts Chafe hoarsely at their thin and creaking walls With frightful discord, and the ominous waves Dash at the rude partition, as in scorn, Striking with multitudinous hands. The lights, Before and aft, dispense their scanty raysâ How spectral, thin, and ineffectual!â Which oft the sheeted lightning in the south, With sudden brilliance, dims, and shows the guard, An instant, where to set the helm and where To ply the sidelong oar. Thus speeds the ark; And midnight rules the wild tempestuous hour. On deck the men are gathered by the oars; Below, the women sit in dreary groups, Waiting and listening: some with infants clasped, Convulsive, on the breast, while at their feet The older children crowd, their terror drowned In unrecording sleep. But hark! the shock! The shout above! the shriek below! the neigh Of frighted steeds! Fear rules the scene. On deck All crowd with straining eyes, which naught discern Save random lights on shore. Their course is stopped; And, lo, a noon-like sheet of lightning flames, And shows their ark 'mong rafts and steamers lodged; While, like a vision in delirium seen, A midnight city, with its sudden spires, Springs on their sightâa marvellous instant springsâ Then vanishes in night, and leaves them naught But wild conjecture which must wait the dawn. The storm is past; a cloudless day awakes, And to the wondering multitudes on deck A glorious city spreads its welcoming armsâ The Queen Metropolis of inland Statesâ Which, like a mighty heart, receives and gives, Swelling through all the body of the land The pulsing veins of trade. In foundry yards Loud hammers ring upon the boilers hugeâ Too oft the ominous knell of future deaths, Wrought by destruction in the sudden air, Making a murderous gap a nation feels. In each great bolt, 'twixt double sledges clinched, What lives are wedgedâa life for every blow! Bold wielder! strike again, and still again, Lest that the careless stroke hereafter fall, With triple weight, on many an aching heart! Along the sloping wharf the giant keels Swing by their cables, e'en as monsters chained, Frighting the sky with hot discordant breath Heaved from their lungs of fire; and noisy Toil Lays his brown shoulders to the southern bale, Or rolls the cask ashore, where Commerce stands Smiling among the mountainous freight, and sends Her northern product back. Time was, my friendâ Thou, who beneath thine own Catawba vine There is no man to whom the West is more indebted than to Mr. N. Longworth, of Cincinnati. And chief among the benefits which he has conferred must be regarded the introduction of the grape-culture. The country will yet acknowledge him to be the most effectual apostle of Temperance: for it is a remarkable fact that the vineyard is the antagonist of the still-house, and that in vine-growing countries the curse of alcohol is not known. Sittest, like autumn in a plenteous land, Crowned with the fruits of heavy labors past, Forgetting not thy reapers, nor the poor Gleaning amid the stubbleâwhen thy feet Here paced the sod primeval, while the trees Stretched their defiant branches unalarmed. Then were yon hillsâwhich now the reaching streets, Audacious, climb with all a city's dinâ Templed within a Sabbath shade of woods; And where the eagle, on the topmost branch, Gazed at the sun unstartled, nightly, now, In its high tower, the astronomic glass Sweeps the blue space to mightier suns than ours. Within thy memory, on this self-same ground, A forest and a giant city stand. When now the day discloses all the sceneâ The thronging wharf, and their own ark half wreckedâ The adventurers hold a solemn council hour, And in the small republic, on the deck, Discuss their future course. Some, unappalled, Call for repairs; impatient to be on, Some urge a transfer to the rapid barque, Whose flashing wheels shall bear them quickly through; But they whose hands grew brown upon the plough, And they who joyed to drive the well-fed team And laden wain to market, once more sigh To feel the solid earth beneath their feet, To wind their way 'twixt farms and thorough woods, Hewing, if need be, their own forest-path. This plan is carried; and their various wagons Are rolled ashore, and the delighted steeds, Pawing the ground, receive the accustomed gears, The collar and the rein; and all, well pleased, Assume their places, and take up their march. The suburbs now, and now the hills, receive The winding line; and soon amid the fields, The city lost, they note the stretching road Inviting on and on. Another State, With noble farms usurping glorious woods, Now bids them welcome, and still cheers their course; While, day by day, the sidelong forests grow To longer stretches, and the new-made fields, Rougher with fallen logs and girdled trunks, Occur less frequent with their lessening homes. BOOK TWENTY-EIGHTH. Where a far prairie pours its yearly flood Of verdure to a forest's dusky foot, And where a stream to Mississippi flows In endless vassalage, and where the beaver, Like the red Indian and the buffalo, Flying before the fast-encroaching plough, The sickle, and the mill, hath fled so late, Scared by the trapper from his watery doorâ While his small homestead, in the liquid plain, With empty threshold looks abroad amazedâ And where the breastwork still retards the stream, To hint and aid the future miller's dam; Where, through the woodland depth, the wild deer's track Still shows the hoof-prints leading to the brink, And, on the opposing shore, the larger path Worn by the prairie herds athirst; behold One small, rude hut of bark and motley skins Sits, like a tired hunter, on the bank, Companionless and still. Half drawn ashore, A rough canoe lies dreaming; and, near by The forest Selkirk, sitting with his dog, Fondles his rifle and resets the flint. He is of those who, like the venturous bees, Herald the nation following in their wakeâ An advance courier of a world of menâ A scout, from civilization's onward line, Sent to inspect the forest's savage camp. Silent he muses, and athwart his brow Thoughts and their shadows pass like autumn clouds. Perchance he walks, in the departed years, Along some green New England vale,âa child, Led by a parent, while his happy heart Throbs, like an echo, to the Sabbath bell. Dear faces rise, and loving voices speak; A mother's hand smooths back his boyish hair; A sister's glowing arms are round his neck; Or, later, through the scented hay-field strolls, Or sits beside the rose-embowered door, With one whose snowy garment past his soul Now rustles like an angel's floating robe. Perchanceâbut no; his rough and sunburnt hand Dashes the vision from his half-blurred gaze; His swift eye sweeps the prairie to its verge, And, like an arrow, darts through umbrous woods, Where desolation owns him for its lord. Hark! is't a panther leaping through the boughs? Or wild buck flying from pursuit of wolves? Or steeds, which never knew the curb of rein Neighing along the prairie? 'Tis a sound Unusual to his startled ear. The dog Recoils unto his master's feet, and listens. But soon the accustomed eye discerns the cause; And on the trapper's gaze the obnoxious gleam, From the white covers of approaching wains, Strikes on his spirit, like the light of ghosts, Seen in a long abhorrent train. His soul Shrinks from the vision, and within him cries, âIs there no shelter from the reach of men? Or must I, like the westward-going game, Lie down in fear, and only wake to fly? Or, like the tired courser of the plain, Yield me unto the lasso, and submit To wear the rein, and feel the daily whip Which civilization wields, and be a slave Where I have been so free? Or lay my hand Against this brotherhood of trees, and be, At last, a traitor to the wilderness?â Sullen he stands, and notes the line approach; And when a shout goes up among the limbs, âHere will we pitch our camp and build our homes,â He tears the prop from 'neath his cabin roof, And from the ruin takes his load of skins, Shoves his canoe from shore, and, with his dog, Glides o'er the silent waters out of sight. BOOK TWENTY-NINTH. When comes the eveâand in these antique woods Eve comes before its time, and the deep night With double darkness fallsâthen springs the blaze Of crackling camp-fires; while the astonished trees, Half lighted, stand and murmur their surprise To others crowding in the shade behind; And many a bird with fascinated wonder, And stealthy beast, with wide unwinking stare And fixed amazement, gaze with silent fear, Till night is robbed of half its dreary noise. There stands the pastor 'mid his little flock, And opes the wonted volume; while beside, Young Arthur holds the flaming torch of pine, Where all draw round and hearken till the close. Then suddenly the evening hymn is given, Thrilling the leaves with pleasure where it floats, And, for the first, this ancient forest hears The melody of well-accorded souls Breathing of Christian peace; while Desolation, Pained with prophetic music, stands withdrawn, Like some lone Indian, last of all his tribe, Drooping upon his unstrung bow. Then prayer And silence rule the camp. Near byâperchance An arrow-shot beyondâthere is a rock Which overlooks the stream; the ripples break About its giant foot, and from its brow The light vines, growing many a season down, Trail their long fingers o'er the shadowy pool. To gain its top, and wait the rising moon, Which, large and flaming as a chariot-wheel, Now rolls among the eastern stars, with joy The lovers pass, and muse upon the scene. And fancy tells how this exalted spot Hath been, in its oblivion of years, The happy altar where young love hath tamed The savage heart, until the wild soul felt The tranquil pleasure which 'tis ours to know Beside the Christian hearth. Or here, perchance, In desperate hour, some Indian maid, forlorn, Hath to the midnight flung her streaming hair,â Plunged, like the pleiad, to be known no more. Around, below, the world is silent, dark. Or waked by wild, uncomprehended sounds, Making the solitude more lone; as when Some star-led watcher, on a noiseless deck, Hears the far waves communing with themselves. Speechless they rest, and gaze into the sky On that white path of splendor, like the track Left by a vessel on the midnight seaâ Foamy, phosphorent, nebulous, and strangeâ The highway of the universe, perchance. And populous with mightier worlds than this. From out the dusk of that deep silent wood, They pore upon the heavens with wandering thoughtâ More 'wildered as it wanders through the maze And intricate bright tangle of the starsâ Until each soul recoils into itself, Amazed, confounded, shrinking with a sigh,â Which sigh, interpreted aright, proclaims, âHow great, eternal, boundless, and sublime! And we, how frail and insignificant!â The merest dust upon the wings of time, Which a rude breath, or the destroyer's finger, Dislodges, and we pass and know not where!â Oh, man, in thy most proud and pompous hourâ Or in the feast among the costly bowlsâ Or throned upon ambition's dizzy top, Where slaves, unto your slightest bidding, fly As leaves before a gustâgo boldly forth, And look upon the silence of the stars; And though your frame be armored up in gold, Your great soul mailed in pride, their quiet light Shall dwindle you to nothing where you stand; Your arrogant spirit be a point so small, That you shall tremble lest that God's own eye Shall not discern you, fluttering in the dust, And leave you there, eternally forgot! But where two souls are, and, with love between, Not self-reliant all, but each on each Leaning reciprocal, and both on God, Not long the gloom of the primeval wood, Or the profounder melancholy shade Pervading space, can overveil their hearts: For so divine a sentiment is theirs, The soul dilates where others only shrink, And, as with angels' eyes, sees all things through The mellow, purple light of Paradise, Making a dawn where others feel the dark. BOOK THIRTIETH. Behold the morn! and now begins the toil. The first loud axe alarms the forest's shade; And there the first tree falls, and, falling wide, With spreading arms that tear their downward way Strips the adjacent branches; the loud crash Thunders to heaven, and the astonished sun Looks down the murderous gap. Thus, ever thus, In the community of men, a wrong To one deals injury to many more. Hark, how the roar runs echoing through the woods, And every oldest oak and sycamore Thrills with prophetic feeling of its fall. Now marks each laborer his future home; And wheresoe'er a spring gives out its rill, There grows the first rude temporary hutâ Named, in the language of the pioneer, âThe half-faced campââof hurried saplings built, And bound by withes of vines, and roofed with bark. In open air the steaming caldrons swing, While the blue smoke sweeps up among the limbs, Tangled, impeded; where, far over all, The forest eagle, circling, sails amazed. Some on the prairie stake their future hearths, Crossing the river at its nearest ford;â There, where the crystal o'er the pebbles slides, Leaving the imprint of the earliest wheels Which ever pressed these cool, delicious sands. Days come and go: at every break of dawnâ While yet the gibbous moon, above the west, Hangs like a ghostly fragment of white cloudâ The youths are forth to find the forest game; And oft the prairie to the woodland gives The rifle's shrill alarm; and many a morn, Ere the red sun hath climbed his first slant hour, The dun deer from the bended shoulder falls, Prone, at the cabin door. Still sounds the axe. For many weeks the heavy forests fall, And, falling, groan aloud, and, groaning, die; And, dying, yield their vernal souls in smoke, And sink in crumbled ashes to the ground, Which the rough plough, among the jagged roots Oft stalled, with difficult progress turns beneath The black and antique mould. And now behold The various crops are sown, and in the soil Await the genial rain and summer sun, To swell the primal harvest of the land. This done, the pioneer may breathe a day; And, looking round him, choose a fitter spot To rear his home and plant his cabin ground. Then follows trimming of the fallen logs; The hewing, and the rolling into place, Occasion oft of many a festive scene, When come the neighbors, each with axe or team, Accomplishing, by well-concerted strength, In one short day a heavy season's task. Behold, even now, upon the gentle slope, And near the spring which, from its rocky urn, Pours down a runnel through a bed of moss, The wooden dwelling must be reared to-day, And Baldwin points the spot. With axe, and adze, And sledge, and iron bar, and voices glad, The laborers come, and make the toil a play. Some place the trunks, while others notch, and hew, And fit the ends, until, with log on log, The walls ascendâat either corner mannedâ Until, at last, against the evening sky They stand complete, and, in the golden sun, The mounted toilers glow like sentinels Upon a tower of old; and now the eve, With mirth and music filled, concludes the scene. Thus, while the crops are springing, spring the homes, And ruder garners for the winter store, Till, lo, a village smiles along the stream; And all the air, with odors of the wood Fresh-hewn, o'erfloods the place with redolence, Sweeter than winds from far magnolian isles. Gratefully to the ear the various sounds Of pastoral life discourse: the lowing kine, The neighing steeds, and early-crowing cocksâ Which, like clear silver bells, awake the dawnâ The only bells which mark the forest hours, Till, hark! the smith's half-sheltered anvil rings, And the light sparkles star the morning dusk. And there the wheelwright rolls his first stout wheel To take the burning tire; while at the stream, Where toiled the beaver, lo, the breastwork grows, And whistling builders labor 'mid their logs. Here, in the pleasant sunny afternoons, Old Master Ethan takes his little flock; And in the shade of one great forest-tree, Left to embower the parson's summer door, On new-fallen timber seats them round, and there Sets up the moderate by-laws of his school. And the low murmur of the urchins' lips Floats on the air, commingling with the sound Of whispering leaves that flicker overhead; And, when the task is done, with rod and line He strolls the woods along the sunset stream. Ere many weeks go by, still other trains, Fresh-breathing of the East, arrive, and fright The farther forest with the flashing axe. There, foremost in the crowd to welcome them, Pale Amy stands, with disappointed gaze, And sadly questions every newest comer If he has seen or heard, upon the road, Aught of a youthful wagoner or horseman, Hailing from Hazelmead, and bound this way. And oft the shaken head, or careless âNo,â Strikes through her eye or ear, until her heart Tolls in her bosom like a bell of death. Lo! once again, upon that starlit rock Where there shall come no smiling moon to-night; For she is gone behind her wonted veil, Gone to her monthly cloister of deep shade, To clear her brow, in silent penitence, Of painful memories of nightly ills Which she beheld on earth.âLo, once again, And e'en the stars seem shrinking in the blue; And o'er the prairie's unreflecting waves The black southwest exalts its stormy wings, And the hot light, fanned from those gusty vans, Darts up the sky in sudden, transient dawns; While o'er the stream, and o'er the sultry grass, The myriad fire-flies mimic the far cloud.â Lo! once again; but not the tranquil scene, Where love led fancy in a 'wildered maze, Through constellated gardens in the blue; But holier, if holier can be. Step lightly; for 'tis God's deep, chastening sorrow Usurps the hour, and fills its solemn task. Two forms are there; and one, with posture prone, Hides her sad face upon the other's lap. âI wait, and wait, and yet he will not come; My mother chides me for my fruitless grief; My father frowns upon me at his board: Oh, better I had died before I loved! Oh, better I had floated with the stream, Floated, and drowned among the muddy drift!â Whereat the other clasps her in her arms, And, speaking, smooths aside her tear-wet hair: âWe have been friends from childhood's early time, When we went tottering truants to the field, And lost ourselves among the harvest grass; And we were friends together in the school, Walking the path, at morn and eve, with hands Locked each in each: and we were doubly friends, When first we interchanged, in whispers low, The secrets of our loves. And when misfortune Falls, like a tree beneath whose shade we built, Not dreaming of the storm, shall we not be, As now we are, with triple friendship bound? Look up, dear friend, and kiss me for reply. E'en though an unkind father closed his door, Another stands, inviting, open wide; And when my Amy hath nowhere to rest, Olivia shall be homeless. Cheer, take cheer! The dreadful sea you shuddered to behold, Is but a troubled verdure, like the prairie, Which, from the distance, looks an ocean wide, But nearer seen becomes a flowery pasture. And look! the cloud, which threatened from afar, Sails, like a ship, around the verge remote, And leaves us undismayed!â BOOK THIRTY-FIRST. Onward still, The giant movement goes with rapid pace, And civilization spreads its arms abroad; While the cleared forest-lands look gladly up, And nod their harvest plumes. The summer speeds; And many a whispering field of wheat and rye Gleams, like a yellow sunshine, in the woods. The grain, deep-standing, half conceals below The primal roughness, where the reaper yet Must take his difficult way; and there the maize, With stalwart growth, as native to the soil, Waves its tall martial tops, and gayly wears Its tassels of soft silk. A few more daysâ Behold the toilers lay their sickles by, And all the sheaves are bound. Oh, happy time! What season of the year so bright as this? The labor done, the sultry crops are in, And now they celebrate with harvest rites; As in the dear and distant vales and years. In shadowy ages of the Pagan past, The âharvest homeâ was scene of sacrifice; There the fat swine poured its red life away Upon the altar stone; and, at the shrine Sacred to Sylva, flowed the dairy flood. To-day a kindred sacrifice is made; But, with improvÃ©d sense, the modern dame Gives from her oven the well-garnished meat, With crispÃ©d rind, and savory with green; And in great jars, fresh-dripping, icy-cool, Cooled in the crystal at the shady spring, The snow-white fluid gleams; where, not less white, Is spread the crimpÃ©d cloth beneath the trees, O'er which the flecks of sun, on golden wings, Flutter 'mid phantom leaves. The sports begin,â The various games which please the rural mind And knit the manly frame. Some throw the ball; From hand to hand the little messenger, Swift as a meteor, flies. Beside the stream, On plushy beds of greenest moss and grass, The wrestlers ply the old Olympian game; Struggling in friendly war, as struggled onceâ So sings Jove's laureateâthe heroes two, Ajax and Ulysses, when Achilles Bade the great game begin and end, and gave To both, so equally they strove, the meed Of well-earned victory. Through sun and shade, Some in the foot-race emulate the deer; Or, like the wild buck startled from his lair, Leap the incredible space. While others bend And lift the monster weight which, heaved beyond, Deep dents the soil, and shakes the adjacent ground. But, yonder, mark the sport which pleases most, And most to be approved. Whirling in air, The swift quoit cleaves its long and graceful arch, And strikes, half buried in the soil, aslant, Beside the well-marked spot; on which a second, With equal aim, oft clangs with fiery glance, Flying aside 'mid shouts of those who win; Or, with still nicer judgment sent, descends, And crowns the difficult meg. Behold yon form The moment when the balanced ring is spedâ The foot advancedâthe expanded chestâthe arm, An instant stretched with open handâthe eye Following the iron flight, e'en as an archer's Chases his wingÃ©d shaft! No nobler shape, Or freer movement of the form divine, May charm the artistic sight! So stands to-day The sculptured Greek in Rome: as if great Jove, Thrilling with admiration at the scene, Had turned the man to marble when he threw, And made the act immortal, that, henceforth, The Parian shape should nobly teach the world The manliest classic game. Far through the woods Ramble fair bands of happy youths and maids; And noisy children, curious in their search, Proclaim the novel wonders where they go. There blooms some unknown flower; and there hangs, To ripen in the autumn frost, the wild Banana of the North; and, lowly, there The golden mandrakes, odorous, profuse, Drag down their yellow stalks. Between the trees, As through an antique colonnade o'ergrown With moss and creeping vines, the lovers walk, Musing, delighted, on the marvellous wild; Here, gaze in wonder on the monster path Where strode the great tornado, summers past, O'erturning trees whose giant roots in air Rose, like a barricade, behind its flight; Or here, their light steps fright the astounded squirrel, Which flies the prone logs to its native tree. Behold these pillared trunks, which, ere they prop Their rafter limbs, and cornice of deep green, O'ertop the tallest oak in cultured fields; Here Europe's groves might grow, and wave beneath, Nor graze their plumes against the lowest branch: Here hangs, as if from heaven, the antique vine, Or clasps the trunk with anacondian coils! And where the younger festoon, like a rope Drooping between two mast-heads to the deck, Sways in the wind, inviting to the young, The woodland people, in their boisterous mirth, Usurp the swing, and sweep the shadowy air. Ye who condemn the red man's tameless life, Go forth into the primal forest depth, And feel the freedom which pervades its shade; There taste the fruit upon uncultured stalks, And slake your thirst at fountains, sunless, cool; There note the game your every step shall start, And you shall find, in your own Christian breast, A savage spirit, pleading to remain, Claiming its ancient patrimonial right. But hark, upon the breath of afternoon, A sound is floating, and all stand to hear; And e'en the birds sit listening in amaze; In delicate notes, alternate heard and lost, Breathed from the rosined cordage of the viol, It flows from out the clearing, and, at once, All guess the call, and hasten to the scene, Where dance and mirth fill up the fading hours. BOOK THIRTY-SECOND. Of all the lovely seasons of the year, None is so full of majesty as this, When red October, like a king of oldâ As wise as rich, and generous as wiseâ Smiles on the untaxed garners of the land. The fields lie cleared and brown; and all the woods Gleam with a mellow splendor, where the gold Vies with the purple and the crimson glory,â The sunset of the year. Whence soon shall follow The gusty twilight of November days; Then the dull, rainy eve, till Winter comes, Like a white moonlight night, and shuts the scene With his pervading snow. The prairie grass Sways, seethes, and dryly rustles in the airâ A harvest sound, where only fire shall reap; And over all an azure mist is spread, Silent and dreamy, where the autumn sun Rolls flushed and large; and, through the smoky sky, The airy eagle, like a pirate barque, Sails, tacks, and veers, and looks abroad for prey. Now that the heavier tasks are done, the woods Ring and re-echo, and the cabin walls Are coated o'er with furry skins, to dry; While oft the eve, beside the blazing fire, Beholds the moulding of the murderous balls. But, now, what means this early morning stir, This general voice, and merriment abroad? On restive steeds the assembled hunters mount; The powder-oxhorn at each girdle hangs, Swung like the forest-bugle worn of old. There weighs the laden pouch; and, in the belt, The smaller fire-arms slant; while, in the hand, The polished rifle gleams, and coils of rope Hang at the saddle-bow,âa lasso rude. And lo! the cavalcade across the stream Dashes, with shouts, toward the prairie lands! O'er the far plains, in dim and dusky lines, Moving like wave on wave, their sight discerns, Or fancies it discerns, the bison herd Which roams the vernal sea; and, like a crew That notes on the horizon, vague, remote, Their giant prey, which spouts the brine in air, And from the vessel drops, in venturous boats, Striking abroad upon the billowy deepâ The pioneers sweep up against the wind, Spreading as they approach, to circumvent, That each may choose his victim from the flock, And, as he passes, send the bolt of death. Thus speed they on, with weapons grasped secure, And near and nearâmore cautious as they nearâ Widening the snary crescent of their lineâ Till, lo! the bearded patriarch of the herd Exalts his front, and gives the quick alarm! A sea of heads and horns is in the air; And, swift as yeasty waves before the gale, Sweeps the full tribe, with their innumerous hoofs Making continuous shudder in the ground, Loud and tremendous, as when through the cane Roars the tornado! Now the chase begins; And, presently, the volleyed rifles ring, While here and there the dying monster drops; Or, wounded, leaves behind the sanguine trail, Till, fainter and more faint, he staggers, sinks, While his pursuer tracks his flying mate. Or see yon giant, where he stands at bay,â The flashing eyeballs and the foaming mouth,â The foam half crimson! From his fated side The red stream pours, and still he bravely fronts The assailing hunter, thrusting left and right, And oft the wary charger, with his rider, Darts from the plunging horns; and, as he fights, He feels the numbing pain within his breast, The leaden foe his fury cannot reach! Still he resists; and slowly fails and failsâ His eyes grow filmy, and his sight is dimâ Sullen, from side to side, the great bulk swaysâ The wide plain reels around him, and he falls, And lifeless lies the hero of the herd! What though the muse attempt the murderous scene, Her spirit finds small pleasure in the song, And shrinks before the vision she has drawn; The sounds grate harshly, and seem out of tune, Jarring against each other. Rather far Her eye adventurous sweeps the distant hill, And follows Arthur, where, with glittering hoofs, His charger o'er the billows of the plain Mounts and descends, to take the prairie-steed Grazing among its fellows. The wild group, With nostrils wide, soon note the scented air; And o'er the ridge the unshod coursers speed, Giving their streaming manes unto the wind, Like that mad team which charioted the sun, Flying afar, eccentric, unrestrained, With PhaÃ«ton behind. In hot pursuit The guided charger sweeps, and, taking oft A shorter course direct, still intercepts, And, straining every muscle, nears and nears, Until the fatal cord is sped, and falls, And the wild creature feels the tightening snare, And yields at last unto the lariat curb; Then, led in triumph to its captor's friends, Stands with wide eyes of wonder. When the sun Pitches his blazing camp along the west, Following their lengthening shadows, stretching home, The laden hunters ride; and in the dusk Behold their fire-lit windows, like the stars, Smile in the darkening east. The plain is passed; Their doors receive them; and throughout the eve, Beside the autumn fire, sit gray-haired men, And maids, and matrons, and the wondering young, Listening the marvellous history of the day, Where oft the shadowy people on the wall Leap up, and clap their visionary hands. Again the pictured bison toss away, Shouldering o'er tangled grassâagain the chaseâ Again the bleeding giant fights and dies. Musing and marvelling Master Ethan sits, While o'er his chair Olivia leans, and hears The glowing language which her lover breathes; And when again the lariat takes the steed, And the wild creature struggles with the noose, Her wonder half to chastening pity melts. So great the pleasure of the eventful time, Each sighs to think of those, left far behind, Who dream beside their tame ancestral hearths, Dozing monotonous lives away, and longs To pour into their ears the exciting theme, And woo them to the West. Here, drawn apart, Pale Amy listens, mourning in her soul, Thinking of one who also, 'mong the rest, Might have repeated to her charmÃ©d ear The wild exploit, and, 'mid the smiles of all, Returned the long-praised hero of the chase. But hark, the song awakes the shadowy eve:â âForm the ring, and pile the fire; Swell the chorus, like a choir, While the minstrel wakes his lyre, Bound with garlands never sere. And, like holy stars arisen From their orient blue prison, Joy shall mount, and Peace shall listen, While the social hearth shall glisten, On the newly-found frontier. âLet no dull regret remind us Of the homes which lie behind us, Or the tear of memory blind us To the world of beauty here: Let the past retain its pleasure, While the present, without measure, Opes the promised land of treasure, Where wide Freedom's dome of azure Overbends the far frontier. âSoon the forest, like the bison, Shall enrich the land it dies on, And the ground, its shade now lies on, Smile in harvests broad and clear. Then the gloom these lands inherit, Like a shadow from the spirit When the world rewards its merit, Shall departâthe sun shall scare itâ From the bountiful frontier. âThen, alone, within the furrow, Or in woodland alleys narrow, Shall some flint-head of the arrow Speak of tribes long sped from here; Or the children, while they're playing, Find the stone axe in their straying, Or the lone wigwam decayingâ The last fading signs betraying Who once ruled the dark frontier. âRound our barques yon stream shall ripple, On yon bank rise church and steeple, Where the bell to busy people Shall ring, hourly, silver-clear. And the eagle, sailing airy, With his downward glances wary, Shall behold the swift scene vary Over forest, stream, and prairie, Wondering at the changed frontier. âAnd his wings shall mount, affrighted, O'er the scene so strangely lighted, And to Western wilds, benighted, Take his marvelling career; Yet, before his flight he urges, From the clearing's noisy verges, He shall see the silvery surges On the mill-wheel, hear the forges Which shall wake the far frontier. âAnd 'mid scenes of peaceful culture, Shall the dove succeed the vulture, Ere the pioneer's sepulture Tolls the bell or starts the tear. And our State from its probation Soon shall take its glorious station In the union of the nation, And the coming generation Westward seek a new frontier.â The song is done. Lo, through the casement seen, A marvellous light along the southern sky Flames with an angry hueâas in the east, Oft, o'er the full and yet unrisen moon, The strange light blots through veils of evening mistâ While, like an eagle's shadow, o'er the plain The frequent deer flies north. The hungry wolf Forgets his prey, and prowls into the woods; The frighted steed, with many an unknown shape, Sweeps past beneath the starsâas when at sea The speeding tribes proclaim the foe behind. And still the great light, on the prairie's verge, Springs like the boreal glow in winter seen,â A spectral, melancholy dawn: as if The south would fling the north its splendors back; Or earth, like some great vessel sideward thrown, Had far careened, and from the tropics brought The red, unnatural morn. And, thicker still, Pour on the heterogeneous herds. And now A roar sweeps wide upon the sultry airâ As when the wind, wet with Niagara's mist, Bears the perpetual thunder leagues awayâ It nears and nears. âThe prairie is on fire!â And the announcement flies from door to door, Swift as from tent to tent a call to arms, When down the distance pours the assailing foeâ âThe prairie is on fire!â And on the wind The red tornado spreads its blighting wingsâ Fearful and splendid in magnificent rageâ Chasing the frantic dwellers of the plain, Flying in reckless terror. Such the sceneâ Abhorrent, awful, wonderful, sublimeâ Which passed o'er Milton's inward sight, what time He saw the infernal lake, when from the fire The shadowy demons, to their master's call, Sped in a cloud confused. Around the homes, Pitched on the prairie's side, fear rules the scene; And consternation throbs in every breast, And stupefies the needed ready mind; Till one, with cooler presence than the rest, Grasps the great blazing brand, and wildly flies, And streaks the grass with flame. The powdery mass Flashes and roars; and, with its mane of fire, Drives left and right; and, flickering to the skies, Darts o'er the plain to west, and north, and south; And, with the other merging, leaves the space Where stand the anxious pioneers agaze, While many a prayer of thankfulness ascends. BOOK THIRTY-THIRD. The skies are clouded, and the sad winds sweep, Wailing along the forest, like a bard Pouring a requiem upon his harp. All sights and sounds are dreary; and the pipe, So long attuned to pleasurable exploits, Breathes like a widowed night-bird unconsoled. A melancholy wide pervades the air; Whence falls the shadow? what invisible hand Spreads the dusk veil? Is it that Autumn drops Her chilly mantle, like a funeral weed, Trailing and rustling on the gusty wind? Or some presentiment of ill to come, Half comprehended, springs? Is it that grief Stands ever at the chair of revelling joy, To fill with bitter the alternate cup,â A medicine to temper the sweet draughts Which, else, would cloy and sicken? Let it pour! It is the great Physician who prescribes! Does disappointment lower? or yawns the grave? Not even this should overcloud us so. At all our portals Death, impatient, stands; As oft, beside the door of one who feasts, The watchful bailiff waits. Who may escape? We but prolong the banquet at the best; And happy those who unbesotted rise, With vision clear, and go to their account. O'er lands from which the driven savage flies, A direful spirit lingers, as to avenge The red man's wrongs,âto execute the curse He breathed upon the landscape when he fled. From lake and river, and low, sodden marsh, The blighting phantom, on miasma's wings, Rises, and sheds its night-brewed venom round; And from its ghostly pinions widely fans The alternate airs of dreadful fire and frost. The incautious breast, inhaling unaware, Now burns with heat, no winter's breath could quell; Now shakes with cold, no furnace-blast could reach; Consuming now, as in a martyr's flame, To shiver soon as in a cave of ice. To grateful draughts now cling the fevered lips; Now, pinched and purple, drain the scalding bowl: Such is the startling blight the autumn sees Sweep o'er the frontier homes. Here shuddering forth, Seeking the sun against his cabin wall, With trembly knees, the laborer, late so strong, Now crawls to thaw the current of his blood, Or shivers in the blazing chimney-side; And there the matron droops. Crouched o'er the hearth, Baldwin, disheartened, gazes in the flame, His sad soul aching with the internal cold. Meanwhile, his good wife, struggling, unsubdued, Holds, as with palsy-shaken arms, the child Which, like an ember, burns upon her breast. Olivia, only spared of all the house, Glides, like an anxious angel, 'mid the group, And fills her trebled duties all the day; While frequent sunshine of her generous face Gladdens the neighboring doors. And Arthur oft, Himself pursuing charitable paths, Beholds her pass, and feels his love increase. Nightly, by Amy's bed, her golden hair Sheds a soft splendor; and her saint-like voice, Low as the summer music of a brook, And mellow soul-light beaming from her eyes, Half melt the ague from the sufferer's heart. Here Master Ethan, ever on the alert, Forgets himself, to go from couch to couch. Now, to the fevered fancy, glowing springâ In all the brightness time and distance give, When want and pain attend the exile's bedâ The charmÃ©d home, the dreamy-lighted vale, The fireside comforts, and the wholesome air; Which once again to feel, and freely breathe, Were panacea for the mind and frame No subtle drug could match. Yet few there are, In the heroic group, whose hearts, subdued, Harbor the homesick vision; but resist, With stubborn valor, as a forest-tree Resists the assailing blast. Beside the stream, Where the low chapel lifts its modest head, Of fresh-hewn timbers built, the first small mound Is shaped; and Baldwin's household mourns. From there The light of childhood passed; from out their door The shape, so morning-haloed once, was borne,â A little form of dull and sunless dust. And now the rude inscription sanctifies The enclosÃ©d spot, and to the future speaks:â âThe first pale flower here consecrates the ground.â Here Christmas comesâhow different from the last! The little stockings, at rude wooden jambs, Are hung again with undiminished faith; Each chest in secret turns its contents out, And, ransacked oft, gives scantly to the time. And meagre joy had crowned the prayed-for morn, Had not Olivia's busy, generous hand Oft plied the midnight needle, and, unseen, Wrought curious shapes within the flowery tray; While Arthur's dexterous knife, and ready taste, Carved wooden forms of beautiful device. The week, to happy childhood dear, departs. Now sweeps the snow, and blows the boreal blast, While winter, like a crabbed regent, rules The young, obstreperous year. On many a night, The wakeful household, shuddering with the windâ Which searches every cranny, while the snow, A powder fine, attends the inveterate gustâ Shall hear, dismayed, the direful panther's cry, Startlingly human, and the adventurous wolf Howling in fearful nearness; and, in dreams, Behold the ravage wrought in bleating sheds! And oft the pioneer shall start, alarmed, And with the rifle steal into the dark To guard the midnight fold. Such are the scenes, The hardships, and the perils which deter Full many a spirit in its Eastern home, Long wishing to be gone. The trials these Which only sternest natures well can meet. The fight is hard, the battle long sustained, Ere the wild forest yields, and the broad land With unresistance wears the peaceful yoke. Bid Civilization send unto her verge The frame of iron and the heart of oak, With courage, will, and sinew to subdue: Let gentler natures court a gentler scene. BOOK THIRTY-FOURTH. The season comes when, from her three-months' trance, The Earth awakes: already her deep heart Begins to stir, and send its life abroad. On slopes, which lie adjacent to the sun, The snows grow thin and vanish, and the air Is scented with the odors of the mould; For there the Spring, with warm and delicate feet, Fresh from her hidden caverns of perfume, Walks in the noon to wake the early flowers. Here the first bird begins the woodland's song; But in yon maple grove, where genial airs Are earliest to blow, and last to leave, A louder voice is heard. The auger there Passes from tree to tree, and deals the wound Whence flows the saccharine crystal into troughs, Propt at the great trunks' feet; while overhead The squirrel swings, and looks in wonder down. And now begins the pleasurable toil Which tends the sugar-camp. The fire is built: All day the smoke rolls through the antique boughs, All night the blaze illumes the forest-depths! And there the giant caldron seethes and steams, Until the simple alchemy bestows The dusky syrup which, in cooling jars, Transmutes, and gives the granulated mass; Or often, poured in shallow depths, contracts To marble smoothness, waxen to the eye, Hard to the tooth, delicious to the taste, Dearer to childhood than a Christmas toy. It is the spring-time. Down yon woodland path A lovely picture glides between the trees, Taking its way unto the chapel door. Gay garments, and soft fluttering robes of white, Charm the calm sunshine, while the swelling hymn The slow procession chants, ascends the air, And, unimpeded, passes into heaven. Behold the pastor leads the sacred way, Then Arthur and Olivia. Look again! How beautiful the maiden's downcast eyes, With drooping lids that hold the happy tears! A hallowed dream-light floats o'er all her form; The snowy vesture rustles at her feet, With pleasant music, as of whispering leaves. Her golden hair, the veil but half-way hides, Sparkles with April's choicest violets, By loving fingers plucked from sunniest spots While yet the morn was red. Her parents next, Pale and disheartened with the trying year, Follow, with Master Ethan at their side: And not the memory of the long disease, The want of comforts, and the weakening toil Which their slow feet betray, can check the light Of pleasure springing to their languid eyes. And after these, upon her mother's arm, Comes Amy, with weak trembling steps, her cheeks Glowing, as fits the occasion; but, alas! It is the fiery rose that fever gives, Which, but a few hours hence, shall be consumed, And leave the hue of ashes there instead! Then follows the whole glad community; And presently the sanctuary door Receives the line, and silence reigns without. Here while we rest, in quiet musing held, And gaze upon the empty cabin-homesâ Where one stands waiting, with warm glowing arms, For those we shall no more behold as two, But bound together in that golden bond Which, to the trusting heart, scarce death can breakâ Let contemplation view the future scene. Afar the woods before the vision flyâ Swift as a shadow o'er the meadow grass Chased by the sunshineâand a realm of farms O'erspreads the country wide; where many a spire Springs in the valleys, and on distant hills,â The watch-towers of the land. Here quiet herds Shall crop the ample pasture, and on slopes Doze through the summer noon. While every beast Which prowls, a terror to the frontier fold, Shall only live in some remembered tale, Told by Tradition in the lighted hall, When the red grate usurps the wooded hearth. Here shall the city spread its noisy streets, And groaning steamers chafe along the wharves; While hourly o'er the plain, with streaming plume, Like a swift herald bringing news of peace, The rattling train shall fly; and from the Eastâ E'en from the Atlantic to the new-found shores Where far Pacific rolls, in storm or rest, Washing his sands of goldâthe arrowy track Shall stretch its iron bond through all the land. Then these interior plains shall be as they Which hear the ocean roar. And Northern lakes Shall bear their produce, and return them wealth; And Mississippi, father of the floods, Perform their errands to the Mexic Gulf, And send them back the tropic bales and fruits. Then shall the generations musing here Dream of the troublous days before their time; And antiquaries point the very spot Where rose the first rude cabin, and the space Where stood the forest-chapel with its graves, And where the earliest marriage rites were said. Here, in the middle of the nation's arms, Perchance the mightiest inland mart shall spring. Here the great statesman from the ranks of toil May rise, with judgment clear, as strong as wise; And, with a well-directed patriot blow, Reclinch the rivets in our union bands, Which tinkering knaves have striven to set ajar! Here shall, perchance, the mighty bard be born, With voice to sweep and thrill the nation's heart, Like his own hand upon the corded harp. His songs shall be as precious girths of gold, Reaching through all the quarters of the land, Inlaid so deep within the country's weal, That they shall hold when heavier bands shall fail, Eaten by rust, or broke by traitor blows. Heaven speed his coming! he is needed now! He wisely spake who said, âLet me but sing The songs, and let who will enact the laws.â There are whose lips are touched with living fire: In this great moment are they silent now? Lift up your foreheads, O ye glorious few, Exalt your laurels in the gusty air! And, like brave heralds on a windy hill, Let your clear voices as a bugle ring! The wild time needs you. There are trembling hearts To strengthen and assure; and there are tongues, Uttering they know not what, that should be drowned, And babbling lips that should be filled with song, Lest they breathe treason unaware. Who dares, Like that bad angel which dismembered Heaven, Stand forth, and, with âdisunionâ on his lips, Earn endless infamy? None are so base. Or if he livesâthe world on land and sea Hides many monstersâlet his villain tongue, In its proclaiming, struck with palsy, cleaveâ Cleave to the roof, as with a ten-years' drought, And rot to ashes in the traitor's throat! And may his arm which lifts the severing sword Be lightning-shivered ere it gives the blow! And on his brow be branded these black words: âBehold the Iscariot of his native land!â Then drive him forth in all his impotenceâ The wide earth's exileâan abhorred show! O thou, my country, may the future see Thy shape majestic stand supreme as now, And every stain which mars thy starry robe, In the white sun of truth, be bleached away! Hold thy grand posture with unswerving mien, Firm as a statue proud of its bright form, Whose purity would daunt the vandal hand In fury raised to shatter! From thine eye Let the clear light of freedom still dispread The broad, unclouded, stationary noon! Still with thy right hand on the fasces lean, And with the other point the living source Whence all thy glory comes; and where unseen, But still all-seeing, the great patriot souls, Whose swords and wisdom left us thus enriched, Look down and note how we fulfil our trust! Still hold beneath thy fixed and sandalled foot The broken sceptre and the tyrant's gyves; And let thy stature shine above the world, A form of terror and of loveliness! This passage was suggested by Powers's statue of âAmerica,ââone of the few works worthy to become the property of a nation. BOOK THIRTY-FIFTH. Along yon rugged road which, like a stream, Bursts through the shadowy forest to the westâ Where many a wain, like a deep-laden barge, Sweeps with the current following the sunâ Behold to-day, with toilsome course reversed, One lonesome team is heading to the east. Crouched 'neath the cover, pale and sick at heart, Like wounded sufferers from a camp of war, The dwindled household of the pioneer Pursues its homeward way. And when the wheel Sinks, in the black mire stalled, 'tis Baldwin's arm Now robbed of half its strength, impels it on. And Master Ethan on the prairie steed, The gift of Arthur, slowly rides beside. Too stern the battle for such souls as theirs. At best, the forest is a stubborn foe, Debating every inch it gives; but when His pale ally from sudden ambush springs, And deals from unseen hands the certain blow, They must be stout, indeed, who still resist, Preferring death to honorable retreat. When the third eve upon their laboring way Threatens impending darkness, and the fire Lights up their lone and ill-provided camp, Which the red sunset mocks along the sky, And the tired horses crop the scanty grass;â Lo, to the wondering languor of their looks, A dreary figure o'er the summit toils, Approaching slowly; and the shadowy shape Looms strangely dusk against the crimson west, Startling in this lone place the sickly eyes That watch the coming form. What may it be? The shape is human; yet the clearings lie So separated by long miles of woods, To meet a lonely traveller in such place, And at such hour, the coolest reason deems The chance as rare; and fancy half believes Yon nearing shade the nightly-walking ghost Of some poor pilgrim who, beside the road, Sat down, wayworn, and laid its life-load by. And still it nears, and still amazement springs. Its robes disordered and o'erspread with mireâ Its wild hair floatingâand its wilder eyes Fearless and staringâand the parted lips Breathing no audible soundâmake it, indeed, A sight to send a shudder through the soul And start the brow's cold dew. But hark, a cry Of recognition thrills the twilight air, And Amy's arms are round the matron's neck. Oh, love, thy thorns outnumber all thy flowers; And oft the frenzied eye-glance tells, as now, How thy sharp, cheating garland wounds the brain! Thy clearest streams oft wind to gulfs of woeâ Thy morning clouds of beauty end in stormâ Thy sheltering myrtles call the lightning downâ Thy violet by-ways tend to fields of briersâ Thy dove oft proves a vultureâand, in short, So deeply art thou leagued with old Despair, Who sittest ever on a throne of tombs, Thy brightest path leads nearest to his realm. The heavy weeks toil past. June rules the sky. When now, in middle of the afternoon, The great white sun impends above the west, Flooding the valley with his dreamy lightâ Where farm, and village, and star-glittering spires Shine like the enchanted realm of peaceâbehold, On yonder brow beyond the crossing roads, The little wagon rises, and stands still. The weary horses droop; the harness hangs, Along their lank sides, roughly and awry; The careless rein drops, coiling, to the ground; The dusty wain is loose and out of joint; The cover soiled and warped. A dreary sight! And not less woful, in their wayworn garbs, The melancholy group whose tearful eyes Take in the landscape dearest to their hearts. And while they gaze, their joy is half rebuked With wonder why they left so fair a spot. Yonder, within its little knot of trees, The sacred homestead smiles; and, there, the fields Which called them to the harvest; but, alas, The stranger in their native doorway stands, His scythes along yon clover-pasture sweep, And all the acres hold his waving crops. The unknown mower wipes his reeking blade, And, whistling, whets its sun-reflecting side; The pleasant odor steals along the breeze, Sweet as from out the hay-fields of the past; The cow-boy, singing on the distant slope, Turns home the tinkling herd. There springs the smoke From long-remembered hearths. Some stranger smith Awakes the ringing anvil; and from far, The giant hammer of the stream-worked forge Throbs through the air its old familiar beat. There gleams the chapel on its Sabbath-hill, Where now some foreign pastor wakes the desk; And in the lowland, by the winding stream, Flashes the mill-wheel; but who tends the mill? Here, by the highway, the elm-shaded school Lulls the soft air with murmurs; but within What faithful master fills the sovereign chair? Such are the sights and such the thoughts that rise, Till each heart throbs with mingled joy and pain. Their feet, forgetful of long travel past, Receive new impulse, and descend the road, Taking fresh vigor; as if e'en the dust, Which held their footprints in their younger years, Gave back the lightness of those brighter days. So great a draft the westward-going line Made on the happy vale, to fill the gap, From various sides, came in the stranger crowd, Usurping fields and hearths. The homeward few Gaze wistfully to meet one well-known face. As yet but unfamiliar, curious looks Greet their return, until their little wain Drags its slow course toward the wayside inn, The centre of the vale; when to their side, With wondering eyes and questions on his lips, One old-time friend with many welcoming words Assails the group, and guides it to his gate. And there his good wife, with astonished tears, Receives the wayworn pilgrims; while, outside, The rattling bars admit the ungeared team. BOOK THIRTY-SIXTH. The red sun sinks, and brings the noiseless eve; Within the orchard, ere he drops to rest, The robin pours his vesper hymnâhis voice Closes the chorus of the day; while now, Within the shadowy grove, the whippoorwill Takes up the song, and leads the nightly choir. Through yonder lane one tall, frail figure movesâ Moves like a phantom, sighing where he goesâ While in the east the white moon, as in pity, Watches his lingering steps. These are the fields His once strong arm had cleared. In this same pathâ Since when full half a century has flownâ He led his fair bride home. And these tall trees, Whose high leaves whisper in the upper air, He bore as saplings in his arms, and set The roots, now spread so broad and deep. And here His happy children played. But now, alas, His feet intrude upon another's grounds; And through yon garden, where the long-gone past Oft heard his household singing 'mid the flowers, The iron highway unrelenting cleavesâ Cleaves like an arrow through a heart forlornâ Where soon the engine, with discordant wheels, Shall scream and thunder by. He turns in pain, And strides the new-mown fieldsâhis fields no moreâ And gains the little chapel. Its calm shape, Unchanged, melts o'er his spirit like the smile Of one whose tongue is ever tuned to peace; And down the little garden of low tombs He walks once more among his cherished friends, Brushing the dewy roses where they sleep. Here feels at homeâhere breathes a freer airâ And in his deep heart hears the welcome given Which strengthens and consoles. Long by one grave He leans with tranquil tears, and stands as one Who waits beside a happy palace gate, Hearing his comrade's gliding feet within, And hearkens for the warder's opening key. The warder lingers, but the feast will last; And they who come to-morrow, and to-morrow, Shall find the eternal banquet but begun. With firmer steps the old man turns awayâ Crosses the dewy pastureâthreads the groveâ Till, at the woodland's edge, a sudden hand Falls on his arm, and on his ear a voice Familiar of the past: âThis way, good friend, For here is need of you!â And to her door The dame of Oakland guides the willing feet. âStep lightly and speak low!â and, murmuring thus, She leads across the time-worn sill. Her hand, Palsied and shaking like a winter branch, Points to the woful shape upon her couch. âBehold, for thou art worthy to behold, The frail form wrecked upon the reefs of woe!â Whereat the other, sighing deeply, speaks: âGood dame, 'tis well, the healing arts are yours, You know what plants may medicine her ills.â To which the crone:ââI know that sweet herb well; Already she hath drained the bowl, and sleeps. Believe me, friend, I am not wont to weepâ I thought my springs of pity all were dryâ And yet to-night mine eyes have known strange tears! Speak low, she sleeps! Poor fool, I warned her oft! Oh, double folly, thus to wander back. To seek the thing which was not worth the finding! But piteous Heaven, oft kinder than it seems, Hath moved the wretch beyond her pure soul's reach. A few days past, in some wild tavern brawl, And 'mong companions fit, he made a boastâ The boast that only fools and liars makeâ When scarce the words had passed his scoundrel lips, One nobler than the rest, with sudden hand, Dealt the red stroke that saved a maiden's honor! The son proved worthy the bad-guiding sire, Whom, bloated like his swine, beside his still, Death slaughtered at a blow!âa hideous sight! âPoor child, she sleeps! 'Tis but a half-hour past The hot delirium raged. A little while She lay, and chided, with most piteous word, The tardy lover; and, with broken sobs, Told him the hardships of the lonely woods: But even there, she said, were lovely spots, And she had found them allâthe rock, the glen, And the deep sunless forestâcharmÃ©d scenes, Inviting all to love. Then, with a start, And ghostly smile, like moonshine on her face, She cried, âOh, mother, cease to chide! he comes! I knew that he would come.â And darkly, then, A sudden shadow passed across her brow; And presently she whispered, âWhy so pale? Why stands he there with such despairing eyes? There's blood upon his forehead! there's a wound Which only I should bind! Come, let me twine This kerchief there! Oh, look not thus! smile once, And I forgive!â Whereat she swooned, and slept As she sleeps now!â âYou mean the sleep of death!â The old man cries, and starts unto the couch. âWhat other sleep could soothe?â replies the dame: âThe slumber which we know is poor at best, And full of nightmares!âbut her dreams are past!â And now the veteran takes the clay-cold hand. Smooths back the troubled tresses from her brow, And sighs, â'Tis well,â and by the bedside prays. When through the vale the melancholy news Of their return is spread, the rural heartsâ For simple hearts lie openest to the touchâ Are waked to pity; and the gathered group, The leaders of the place, consult, devise, And settle the benevolent plan. And now, A little home, with moderate acres round, Receives the worthy farmer and his plough, Where soon his household smiles with health renewed. The frail old Master, whose undimmed repute Through many years had widened miles abroad, Accepts the well-urged offer; and once more, Content among the rosy girls and boys, Resumes his morning and his evening walk. His locks grow thinner, and his steps less firm, But cheerily still he rules his small domain; And e'en less frequent sounds his chiding voice, While oft the unnoted fault goes by, and love Outrules the rusted rod. Behold, abroad In summer-noon recess, what happier sight! The glowing children with their laughter loud Startle the scented air; and games begin, Only to end what time the bell recalls. How the glad foliage rustles overhead, As if the angels hovered listening there, Watching the innocent pastimes, likest that In purity which cheers celestial groves! The hour goes by, and still the urchins play;â Another hour, and still another, flies, Until they deem a holiday is given. And peering oft where, leaning on his desk, The Master holds his wonted rest, they turn And look with wonder in each other's eyes, And then renew their games! Dear hearts, play on; Your laughter cannot break his slumber now! His hand of dust shall no more wake the bell; A greater Ruler hath dismissed the school; The weary Master takes recess in heaven! The circling theme is clasped where it began; But, lingering still within this happy vale, The bard reluctant stands. The pipe, attuned To melancholy, yet prolongs the sound, Like waves that murmur when the breeze is done. Ye who have followed in the long-drawn path, And borne with patient steps your pilgrim staffs, Nor dropt aside, wayworn,âforgive the guide, If oft, enamored of the tune he played, He vaguely wanderedâlike an April brook, Blind and oblivious, on its singing wayâ Leading through tedious woods and briery fields; And, like brave travellers from a various tour, Forget the toilâthe dull, inclement daysâ Recalling only landscapes bright with sun. POEMS IN ITALY. BRUSHWOOD. On a weary slope of Apennine, At sober dusk of day's decline, Out of the solemn solitude Of Vallombrosa's antique wood, A withered woman, tanned and bent, Bearing her bundled brushwood went, Poising it on her palsied head, As if in penance for prayers unsaid. Her dull cheeks channelled were with tears Shed in the storms of eighty years; Her wild hair fell in gusty flow, White as the foamy brook below; Still toiled she with her load alone, With feeble feet but steadfast will, To gain her little home, that shone Like a dreary lantern on the hill. The mountain child, no toil could tame. With lighter load beside her came, Spake kindly, but its accents fond Were lost,âsoon lost on the heights beyond. There came the maid in her glowing dress, The wild-eyed witch of the wilderness, Her brush-load shadowing her face, Her upright figure full of grace, Like those tall pines whose only boughs Are gathered round their dusky brows:â Singing, she waved her hand, âGood-night,â And round the mountain passed from sight. There climbed the laborers from their toil, Brown as their own Italian soil; Like Satyrs, some in goatskin suits,â Some bearing home the scanty fruits Of harvest work,âthe swinging flasks Of oil or wine, or little casks, Under which the dull mule went Cheered with its bell, and the echoes sent From others on the higher height, Saying to the vale, âGood-night,ââ âGood-night;ââand still the withered dame Slowly staggered on the same. Here, astride of his braying beast, A brown monk came, and then a priest; Each telling to the shadowy air, Perchance, their âAve Mariaâ prayer; For the sky was full of vesper showers, Shook from the many convent towers, Which fell into the woman's brain Like dew upon an arid plain. These pious men beside her rode,â She crossed herself beneath her load, As best she could,âand so âGood-night,â And they rode upward out of sight. How far, how very far it seemed, To where that starry taper gleamed, Placed by her grandchild on the sill Of the cottage window on the hill! Many a parent heart before, Laden till it could bear no more, Has seen a heavenward light that smiled, And knew it placed there by a child,â A long-gone child, whose anxious face Gazed toward them down the deeps of space, Longing for the loved to come To the quiet of that home. Steeper and rougher grew the road, Harder and heavier grew the load; Her heart beat like a weight of stone Against her breast. A sigh and moan Mingled with prayer escaped her lips Of sorrow, o'er sorrowing night's eclipse. âOf all who pass me by,â she said, âThere is never one to lend me aid; Could I but gain yon wayside shrine, There would I rest this load of mine, And tell my sacred rosary through, And try what patient prayer would do.â Again she heard the toiling tread Of one who climbed that way,âand said, âI will be bold, though I should see A monk or priest, or it should be The awful abbot, at whose nod The frighted people toil and plod: I'll ask his aid to yonder place, Where I may breathe a little space, And so regain my home.â He came, And, halting by the ancient dame, Heard her brief story and request, Which moved the pity in his breast; And so he straightway took her load, Toiling beside her up the road, Until, with heart that overflowed, She begged him lay her bundled sticks Close at the feet of the crucifix. So down he set her brushwood freight Against the wayside cross, and straight She bowed her palsied head to greet And kiss the sculptured Saviour's feet; And then and there she told her grief, In broken sentences and brief. And now the memory o'er her came Of days blown out, like a taper flame, Never to be relighted, when, From many a summer hill and glen, She culled the loveliest blooms to shine About the feet of this same shrine; But now, where once her flowers were gay, Naught but the barren brushwood lay! She wept a little at the thought, And prayers and tears a quiet brought, Until anon, relieved of pain, She rose to take her load again. But lo! the bundle of dead wood Had burst to blossom, and now stood Dawning upon her marvelling sight, Filling the air with odorous light! Then spake her traveller-friend: âDear Soul, Thy perfect faith hath made thee whole! I am the Burthen-Bearer,âI Will never pass the o'erladen by. My feet are on the mountain steep; They wind through valleys dark and deep; They print the hot dust of the plain, And walk the billows of the main. Wherever is a load to bear, My willing shoulder still is there! Thy toil is done!â He took her hand, And led her through a May-time land; Where round her pathway seemed to wave Each votive flower she ever gave To make her favorite altar bright, As if the angels, at their blight, Had borne them to the fields of blue, Where, planted 'mid eternal dew, They bloom, as witnesses arrayed Of one on earth who toiled and prayed. TO H. W. L. Oh thou, the laureate of our Western realms, Singing at will beneath your Cambridge elms, Charming that sacred mansion where the grand Paternal Cincinnatus of our land Dwells, a majestic shadowâmore than king; Who, staidly smiling, hearkens while you sing. Wouldst thou but build in Rome, we should behold O'er Nero's ruins rise the enduring house of gold. But I, a Troubadour born out of time, From shrine to shrine, pour out my idle rhyme, Impelled still onward with a love intense, Singing for love (the only recompense) Of one sweet lady, and perchance to be But spurned at last by scornful Poesy. THE ART PILGRIM. Rome holds to-day in her maternal trust An artist army gone to noteless dust, The tribute of all nations, and they lie, Their campaign o'er, beneath their favorite sky, A tranquil brotherhood. How calmly well They sleep at last in CÃ¦sar's citadelâ As it were sweet to fill an urn in this Earth's mausoleumâFame's necropolis! Only a few brave generals of the field Have left a name which history will not yield; But, emulating these, behold to-day What new recruits still throng the dubious way, Toiling with hope, as if beneath their tread Slept not the host of disappointed dead. And now another joins the aspiring line; A pilgrim knight, and Rome his Palestine. Rome was his dream, since in his boyish path A Fate, or Fury, smiling, or in wrath, Dropt the light pencil of the limner's art, Which seen he seized, and loved with all his heart. Ah me, in sooth, much patient love it needs To toil and starve, where only one succeeds Out of the thousand! Yet, he deemed it grand Even to fail 'mid that devoted band; To labor toward the ever-flying mart, Led by the banners of triumphal Art; Feeling the sweet winds from her pennons flow Athwart the pallid cheek and fevered brow; To hear the music, and the steady beat Of his, and his advancing comrades' feet. Though hard the fare, and difficult the load, Yet Beauty smiled on either side the road, Till it seemed good, in such a land of bloom, To be at rest beneath a nameless tomb. Approaching Rome, he climbed the Apennines, Which round the horizon rolled their billowy lines, Where sailed his heart of hope, while blood as fleet As Mercury's pinions, winged his tireless feet. Sweeter than breath of Fame, the perfumed air Breathed on his lip, and cooled his sunny hair. The scene serene; the sky a liquid blue, Where his wild fancy with the falcon flew. The mountain goatherd trolled his shepherd rhyme, The tinkling bells made chorus with their chime; Thrilled with the lark, the arching azure rang, And full of rosy girls the vineyards laughed and sang. And this was Italyâthe glorious goal Of many a long-gone vision of his soul. Oh, happy youthâhe of the golden hair; His present bright, his morrow promised fair. How many a spirit worthy of such bliss, For such an hour, in such a scene as this, Would barter half its future! Through his brain Young Jasper felt the pleasure throb like pain, Throb like the wings of some glad bird which flies, Aching from slavery, to his native skies. To sketch the beauty of a wayside scene, He turned apart 'twixt rocks and laurels green, And under chestnut boughs, until he found A crumbling crag, with toppling turrets crowned. Fast flies the pencil when the heart directs; When feeling, quicker than the sight, detects The line of loveliness. But, hark, the leaves Are stirred with music, and his eye perceives, In the deep umber of the neighboring glade, Figures, whose fiery colors in the shade Burn like the red light of the setting sun! One blows upon a rustic pipe; and one, Who glows the centre of the flaming scene, Leads their gay footsteps with her tambourine; Still dancing as she plays, her followers, With pleasure more than emulating hers, And intermingling arms, and songs insane, Whirl till the green earth whirls with them again. Thrice round the ring they wheel their dizzy flight, Then past the ruin, laughing, sweep from sight. Though swift they came, and though as swift they sped, The painter caught the vision ere it fled; But, striving still to fix the flying grace Of her who led the momentary chase, He toiled, perplexed, till smothered laughter told He was no more alone; and there, behold! Close at his side the mirthful maiden stood, Poised in the action of her wildest mood, Still as a statue, with the self-same air O'er which his pencil wrought him such despair; The backward shoulders, tambourine aloft; The dark eye full of laughter, large and soft; The black waves rippling through the caught-up curls; The crimson lips just parting on the pearls; The full breasts heaving in their snowy wards, As in rebellion 'gainst the crimson cords; Her height perfection; rounded not too much, A shape, where Nature could not add a touch; In all, a form to poets seldom shown, For which the painters sigh, and sculptors seek in stone. Breathless with wonder, gazed the startled youth, Before his senses could explain the truth, Then madly tore the picture he had wrought, And flung the fragments wide, as worse than naught, And joined the laughter of the wild-eyed maid, Who led him prisoner where her comrades strayed. It was a level space, which once had been The court-yard of a castle, where was seen A fountain, choked as is a tomb with dust; The songless triton thick with moss and rust; Dripping green vines where once the waters flowed; Where ruined arch and broken column showed What marble splendor and what knightly power Reigned on this mountain in the feudal hour. There led the maiden; and the traveller saw Groups of wild men, who, disregarding law, Dwell in such covert places, making bold With others' goods, as doubtless did of old The early masters of these castled heights, When robbers were not thieves, but gallant knights; And Europe still permits the old disgraceâ The boldest robber holding highest place. As witness.ânay, I dare not thrust it home, I hear the usurper's guard patrolling Rome. They leaned, or sat, or lay, in open air, Most lazily making pictures unawareâ The true Italian fashion. Here a troop Drained the red flask, and sang; and there a group Passed the wild storyâmany a curious tale, Worthy Boccaccio. Some there were lay prone And dead in sleep, like statues overthrown, Half buried in the grass. But when came in The maiden with the captive, all the din Of song and story was no longer heard; They ceased, like feathered singers when a bird Of foreign plumage fills their eyes with doubt. The sudden silence, like their leader's shout, Brought all the sleepers to their feet, and they Waited the word to charge, or stand at bay. âBehold!â the maiden cried, and clapt her hands; âSee my first captive; how demure he stands, And offering no resistance. All his gold Is mine if I demand it! And I hold His life within my palm.â Then Pietro cried (Pietro, who held her his affianced bride, And he the captain,âcomeliest of the crew), âTake you the gold, it is your rightful due, But let his life remain as so much weight Of dull red copper, a most cumbrous freight To barques which fly the chasing sloops of State. Make fast your prize, fair pirate, and then lift The precious bales aboard, and let him drift.â Then uprose one, who looked as she might be A mountain Borgia, full of majesty; Her black hair touched with gray, her cheeks with brownâ The tan of forty summers; her swift frown Was like a summer cloud, and lit With fearful lightnings; yet, when she deemed fit, The smile could melt across those features wild With all the sweetness of a guileless child. âNay, Pietro, nay! Though he, whose place you hold As head of this our band, was bad and bold; My master, yes, and thine; he was too brave To bid the hand he loved do what the knave, The cut-throat at his side could do as well! The child is innocent, and so shall dwell, While I remain her mother and her guard.â âCome, come, good mistress; pray you, not so hard!â Gay Pietro answered. âIt were sport to see The young hawk pluck the heron! Would not he Much rather feel those dimpled fingers lurk About his breast, than hands for rougher work. But, be it as you will. There, Jocco, you Try what your art on our new friend can do.â The robber slave strode forward, then recoiled; Though not accustomed to be checked or foiled, Nor easily daunted; but the maiden's look Had something in it which he dared not brook. Then seized she the spadino from her hair, Which fell a storm of tresses, and the glare Of the bright weapon glittering in the sun Flashed like her eye of anger. Every one Cried, âBrava! brava!â even, as at play, Clapping their loud applause, till, far away Among the rocks, the aÃ«rial robber bands Of echoes answered back with merry tongues and hands. Thrice round the throng she sped her fiery glance, Which glittered like a bright, defiant lance, And held her threatening posture till she saw They all approved, and owned her will was law. Then, confidently, in the stranger's hand She placed her own, and said, âLet all the band Show hospitality, and none offend In word, or look, or deed, my artist friend! Have you not heard the Roman painters tell (You, who are models, know the story well) How wild Salvator, in a mountain cave, Lived with the robbers; how they freely gave Their bread and wine, and shelter; and that he Conceived there those great pictures which you see On palace walls, and which the princes hold More precious than thick tablets of pure gold? So was it once; and let it now be shown That we can have a Rosa of our own.â THE CAMPAGNA. Lo, the Campagna! How those startling words Sweep like swift fingers o'er enchanted cords, Thrilling the heart with infinite delight! Lo, the Campagna! The incredulous sight, Sailing from this, the eagle's wild domain, Cleaves the far blue of the historic plain, Fainting with pleasure. How, on this high bar, The soul dilates, and trembles like a star New-born. And, lo! as in a sea of rest, Rome lies, a palmy island of the blest, Glowing with glory. Lo! the aspiring dome, The smaller sky that over arches Rome,â Rome, and the minds of millions,âtill it grows Greater than that it emulates, and shows How Power still sways, with her Titanic will, The ancestral sceptre on her sevenfold hill! Here, where I stand, the weary pilgrim line Drops on its knees before the long-sought shrine. The wayworn mother, with her rapture wild, Holds toward the Dome the wide-eyed, wondering child. Here youths and maidens kneel, with marvellous stare, With pleasure taking precedence of prayer; Drinking the sight, of which, in some far year, The curious grandchild at their side shall hear. Here manhood, from some foreign harvest-field, Kneels, as beside his mother's feet he kneeled; And age, with white locks, bowing to the dust, Salutes the goalâthe temple of his trustâ His old arms crossed upon his tranquil breast, Where all the passions lie in pious rest; The lamb and lionâand the child's controlâ The reign of Peace. Millenium of the soul! How beautiful! Old pilgrim, here by thee The heretic within me bows the knee. ROME ENTERED. The loud vettura rings along the way, White as the road with dust. The purple day, O'er Monte Mario, dies from off the dome, And, lo! the first star leads us into Rome. Oh, glorious city! Through the deepening shade A thousand heroes, like the gods arrayed, And bards, with laurel rustling on their hair, Walk proudly, and speak grandly, till the air Is full of solemn majesty, and night Is half-way robbed by temples marble-white. Yon tramping steeds, and yonder glittering wheelâ Chariot a CÃ¦sarâwhile the commonweal Greets him with pÃ¦ans, and we proudly march On toward the Forum. The triumphal arch, Burning with banners, and the murmuring street, Deep-strewn with roses, till the air is sweet With floating odors. How the heralds blow Their wild delirious trumpets, notes that go Like swift flames soaring with the fiery tune, Bursting from clarions blazing in the noon! Whence come we? from what conquest? with what spoil? Whence are these captives, bleeding as they toil Under our load of trophies? Whips, and groans, And blood, that shames the rose-leaves on the stones For depth of crimson! And the dew of tears Blistering the noonday dust! O'ercome with years, And toil, and grief, there drops the wayworn slave Under the horses, and the conquering wave, Above his carcass, pours its glorious flood Down through the Forum in a path of blood, Roaring with triumph! Do I wake, or sleep? Thank Heaven, 'twas but a dream: a ruined heap The house of CÃ¦sar and of Nero lies! And o'er the golden wall the owlet nightly cries. I. THE SCALINNATTI. In Rome there is a glorious flight of stone, Great steps, as leading to a giant's throne, Or to a temple of Titanic gods. This marvellous height, up which the pilgrim plods, Breathless half-way, seems like a stairway tracked By myriad feet of some wild cataract; Like those where Nilus, with his flag of spray, Leads his wild Abyssinian floods away. Below this giant stairway, in the square, There springs a cooling murmur in the air; The liquid music of a tinkling rill; A stolen naiad from the Sabine hill, Still singing, in captivity, the lay Learned on her native mountains far away. In middle of this fount a marble barge Sits, overflowing with its crystal charge; Its light mast liquid silver in the sun; Its viewless rowers singing every one, Untilâso feigns the fancyâwarmly dark, Great Egypt sails in the fantastic barque, Melting in languors of her own heart's heat, A tame, bright leopard cushioning her feet! But here, with swelling heart, and lordly mien, The stately swan of Avon swims between. âThe barge she sat in, like a burnished throne, Burned on the water,â etc. Antony and Cleopatra. Crowning the flight, a porphyry column stands Dark as the sphinx above the desert sands; Solemn as prophecy it points the sky, Propounding its dim riddle to the eye; And it has seen, with look as calm as Fate's, On Nile and Tiber, the imperial States Rise nobly, and fall basely; and there still Waits for new wonders, silent on yon hill. II. THE SCALINNATTI. In Rome there is a glorious flight of stone, Terrace o'er terrace rising, like that shown To dreaming Jacob, climbing, till on high The last broad platform nobly gains the sky. On this great stairway what are these I see, Ascending and descending? They should be Angels with spotless mantles and white wings. But look again: those sad, misshapen things, They scarce seem human! Where they crawl and lay Their tattered misery in the stranger's way, Filling the air with simulated sighs, Weeping for bread with unsuffusÃ©d eyes. Would they did weep, indeed! for, stung to tears, Then were there hope where now no hope appears. But such the melting influence of the place, That one there wasâmost abject of his race; A whining trunkâdeprived of every gift Save his misfortune; but, with this, did lift Himself to such a height of wealth and power, That many a Roman noble, at this hour, Envies his hoard, and many a sinking name The beggar's usurous gold still keeps from shame. Here the brown Sabines, in their gay attires, Whose eyes still kindle with ancestral fires, Bring down their mountain graces to the mart, And wait for bread on the demands of Art. There Belisarius, with his patriarch hair, Sits blind and hungry. A Lucretia there Winds her light distaff. Young Endymion here Sleeps, as in Latmos. Yonder, drawing near, The original of many a picture moves, And many a statue which the world approves. There sits the mother, with her soft brown eyes Bent o'er the face which on her bosom liesâ Enough of mingled wonder, pride, and trust, To call the hand of Raphael from the dust. THE OLD STUDIO. 'Twixt these four walls, so dusk and soiled by Time, Where you, poor student, with your dreams sublime, Build a proud futureâmany a flaming brow Hath reared the structure you are rearing now, Then saw it, under Time's relentless hand, Crumbling to nothing, like a dome of sand, And the heart with it. Many a canvas here, Painted with life-blood, and the modest tear; Where hope still shed its wild misguiding light: Or where ambition, in his fancied might, Rivalled the masters, now midst dusty lots Of kindred lumber in the Ghetto rots, Gathering blackness, till the stranger calls, And, for a pittance, decks his far-off walls With âRaphaels,â âClaudes,â and other rubbish lies, While the poor artist in his garret dies. In yon low cell, that reeks with ancient damp, The student sculptor burns his nightly lamp; The summer day too short to tire his heart. Art is his toil; his pastime still is art. There hews his statue; suffering as he carves, And at the feet of his first effort starves. Here toiled a courage hunger could not tame, Till crushed ambition sapped the failing frame. Here the young soul for truth and beauty sighed, Till Envy smote him, and the victim died. Here many an aspiration as divine As yours has perishedâas may thine and mine; And we may see the names we write to-day So proudly, brushed, as idle dust, away. Well, let them pass; 'twere nobler thus to fall, Striving, than never to have striven at all. Brave heart, toil on; and grandly struggle still, With steady purpose, and unwavering will; There is reward, though failure crowns your lot, A triumph Time and Envy baffle not; The noble suffering, and the long endeavor, Shall bring the soul its recompense forever. A VISION IN ITALY. The clouds were built of roses; purple showers Of light, like ashes of those flaming flowers, O'erveiled the mountains; and the vesper bells, Like hooded hermits lodged in turret cells, Chanted their âAves.â All the mellow air Throbbed with the trembling pulse of praise and prayerâ The thrill of worshipâtill the deep sky, even, A bell of silver in a greater heaven, Vibrating to the countless tongues abroad, Poured the melodious anthem up to God. To watch the glories of the dying light, A pilgrim mounted to a rocky height That overlooked the mountain's misty sea; Alone he sat in silent revery, Endeavoring to make his heart believe That all the charms of the delicious eve, The sounds, the sunset, and the charmÃ©d air, Were Italy, and he was really there. He looked, and dreamed, until his conjuring gaze Saw marvellous shadows issuing through the haze. Like clouds, they passed majestically slow; Silent as shadows of those clouds below; Stately as ships that skirt the horizon's bar, Bearing their freight of mystery afar. All the great dead of Italy went by, Or rather say, the great, who cannot die; Poets and painters, sculptors, and the rest, Who wore the fire of glory in their breast; Burning, until, consumed with their own flame, They passed to Death, the chief high-priest of Fame, And were thenceforth immortal. Every brow Wore the green chaplet won in toil below, And wore it grandly, spite the thorns beneath, The goring thorns, the skeleton of Fame's wreath, Which first about the bleeding brow she weaves, The better to support the after-leaves. And where the laurel loftiest brushed the stars, He knew its fulness hid the deepest scars. Each bent on him, in passing, their deep eyes, As if they felt that pain which never dies; The memory of mortal hopes and fears, And loves unquenched by their immortal tears. Anon, upon the dusky sky appeared A crowned, colossal woman! which the weird Immortals seeing, in a curving line They rose, and rose above the Apennine, Until the tallest laurels caught a ray Of glory from the sunken flame of day, And thus they circled her. But who was she? Shade of what giantess, thus doomed to be A watcher, with great sorrows overborne, While her poor dust below lay tombless and forlorn! In gloomy quiet sat she, and her throne Seemed but a ruin rankly overgrown; Of ruins only was her queenly seat, And fallen columns lay about her feet, Enough to corridor the starry heaven; While rising round her, through the golden even, Shone grandly many a spectral arch and dome, Shattered, as they had stood a siege at Rome. An empty scabbard in her right hand lay, The other propt her cheek; her hair, half gray, Fell subject to the wind; her drooping head Ached with three crowns, and all her forehead bled; Her once bright mantle, trampled in the dust, Lay tattered, while a foreign robe was thrust About her rudely, held as by a blast, Whereon her eyes at times indignant cast Their direful glances, and her fingers, wild, Plucked at the garment like a fretful child. There, round the sorrowing shadow, stood the line Of knightly phantoms, and their eyes divine Wept when she wept, and what she bade to do Their ghostly hands attempted. Well she knew They were her chiefest champions, and her trust, The guard which kept her memory from the dust. What sound was that? A ringing, martial note Jarred the near hills and streamed through lands remote; And he who blew stood on a rocky crest, A battlement of nature, and the nest Where Freedom rears her tyrant-scorning young: When o'er the heights the clarion far had rung, Obeying answers ran from hill to hill, And in the valley were repeated still. From Adria's mart a painful voice was borne, Like the low wailing of a bird forlorn; Round the Campagna rang the thrilling call, And echoed loudly 'gainst the Roman wall, O'er poisonous marshes, down the purple shore, Then swept the sea, nor died amid its roar. And, lo! the glad Sicilian shepherds heard, And sped through orange groves the wakening word; From Ãtna's side the jubilant echo sprung, Tiil old Vesuvius woke, and all his vineyards rung. These sounds, commingling, reached the shadowy throne; The shade from off the queenly brow was blown, Swift as a cloud gust-driven from the sun, And all her form a sudden splendor won. She dropped the robe, and in her beauty stood, Like Hero, gazing o'er the battling flood. At once, like meteors streaming down the air, Came all her court with every falchion bare, And round the summoning hero closely prest, Fanning the flame that fired his patriot breast. Through all the land there sped tumultuous roar, Loud as the sea. The awakened mountains wore Their battle-flags of fire. The blazing breath Of sudden conflict thundered notes of death; Death to oppression wheresoe'er it be: The despots fled, and Italy was free! âViva Italia!â Every prison door Swung with a sound that clanged from shore to shore. âViva Italia!â In his chains of rust The Press arose and shook them to the dust, Proclaiming, in the tumult of his glee, âViva Italia! Italy is free!â âViva Italia!â rang the glad earth round. âViva Italia!â Answering to the sound, The queenly shade descended, and her pride Was first to wreathe the brow which had defied And frighted her oppressors with its frown. She, who had sat in exile, looking down Long centuries of pain, her sad estate Mocked with the memoryâshe once was greatâ Now felt the long-lost sceptre in her hand, Received once more the homage of the land. MONTE TESTACCIO. Monte Testaccio, or âhill of broken crockery,â rising as it does to the height of one hundred and sixty-five feet, out of what was formerly a swamp, is one of the enigmas of Rome which have baffled the antiquary. Its height commands a fine view of the city and surrounding country. It is about forty-five hundred feet in circumference at the base. That it is composed of one mass of broken earthenware is well attested by the wine-vaults which perforate it on all sides, some to a great depth. It is supposed by some anti-quariesâand I think with great reasonâto have been built of the refuse of the ancient potteries established in this vicinity by Tarquinius Priscus. Others pronounce it to be the dÃ©bris collected from the streets of Rome in later centuries. That this curious mountain has not been added to or changed, and that it has been used as a wine-magazine for hundreds of years, is proved by the most ancient charts and maps of Rome. It is near the gate leading to St. Paul's Church and to Ostia. The Pyramid of Caius Cestius and the Protestant Cemetery lie between. In this latter are the tombs of Shelley and Keats. Monte Testaccio and its vicinity are especially gay with music, dancing, and merry-making generally during the vintage season. The costumes of the peasants, the brilliant trappings of the wine-carts and horses, make the scene attractive, not only to the artist, but to all lovers of the picturesque. This is the hill of vases, urns, and jars The shattered relics of a far-off timeâ It may be those which held beneath the stars The wine of the immortals, when the clime Was golden with the glory of the morn, When the full grapes, half molten in the glow, From globes of lucent amber, or those born Unto the royal purple, gave their flow Of embryo eloquence and mellow verse. Here dusky grottos pierce the deep hill's side, Each welling with earth's sweetest boon and curse, Where mild-eyed Bacchus and his beasts abideâ Where his light beaker, never emptied quite, Shows down its side the golden word âContent;â And though he sings or laughs his joy outright, Beneath that line the wine is never sent. The dregs he throws among his snarling pards, Which rave and roar and wallow at the feet Of old Silenus, who no drop discards, But drains his two-hand flagon at a heat. These murky cells are choked with earthy musk, As they had reached and tapped the antique store Spilt by their shattered vases. The chill dusk Exhales the odor at the reeking door. From jutting fragments, broken lips of beasts, The potter's fancy, mocking webs of mould Pour down this columbarium of dead feasts, And fan the air unutterably old. What revellers o'er these flagons sung and laughed? Where were the vineyards that bestowed the wine? It may be from this jar Ãneas quaffed, And poured his first libation on the shrine Reared at his landing. It may beâBut hold! The astonished fancy, starting at the thought, Shrinks back from her own conjuring, where the bold Oblivious riddle stares and answers naught. Pelasgic, or Etruscan, Romanâall These forms may mingle here; but they refuse, More sternly than the mountains, to recall Their age, their makers, and, it may be, use. Enough! A flood of delicate purple haze Pours through the trees: the very landscape reels With the pure wine of sunset: the soft blaze Heightens the loveliness it half conceals. Spite of the Cross that sanctifies the mound, These must be satyrs 'mong the carts and casksâ Gay peasants, decked in goatskins, lounging round, Glowing with health and brown with vintage tasks. Here, one by one, the little cars come in, Bearing the new-pressed tribute to the hill Crowned with their tents, and jocund with the din Of thick-strung bells, where countless tassels fill The air with brightness, gayly ringing round A melody of colors deftly met. From the near lawn there comes the sudden sound Of hands that improvise the castanet With snapping fingers, while the tambourine Rattles and throbs, and rude Campagna feet Chase the tarantula about the green, Where smiles and flashing eyes together meet. Why, surely this is Arcady? Not so. Or Andalusian dance-enamored home? Not so. Or festival beneath the glow Of old Vesuvius? Pilgrim, this is Rome! But surely these are Bacchus' antique vaults, His chariot caverns and his leopard stalls, About whose doors his thirsty retinue halts? Stand by! The rout begins! his clarion calls! Out of the gates, adrip, as it had dashed Through sudden showers of old Falernian juice, Rings the red car; the mellow air is flashed With music; song and merriment let loose Their fluttering reins, and follow round the hill With flying hair, like ancient charioteers When Nero led the circuit! Hark! be still! Just at the turn where Caius Cestius rears His marble peak, they halt their furious race, And pass demurely, voiceless, with bent heads. Sighing, they pass with melancholy pace Where Keats and Shelley lie in flowery beds. The lowest deity of classic Greece Here, like the highest, bows the willing knee: The last of her anointed bards were these, Though born in exile, where the northern sea Climbs the white cliffs, and, blind with his own locks, Chants to the land Homeric tales of war, Or, like pale Sappho, on the summer rocks Breathes of Ionian isles that woo from far. Under cathedral branches, tall and dark, O'er flowery choirs and ivy-clad retreats, Here swells the requiem of Shelley's lark, Here, nun-like, chants the nightingale of Keats. Though far from England's shrine, they sleep apart, Their â'Minster Abbeyâ is the world's great domeâ Their âPoets' Cornerâ is its mighty heart, While tear-fed blossoms write their epitaphs in Rome! THE APPIAN WAY. WRITTEN IN THE SHADE OF CASALE ROTONDO. Casale Rotondo, six miles beyond the Porte San Sebastiano, is the largest, and, with the exception of the CÃ¦cilia Metella, which it resembles, the best-preserved, monument of this ancient street of tombs. It is supposed to have been erected to Messala Corvinus, the friend of Horace. On the summit of this immense sepulchre are a farm-house, a stable, and a small olive-orchard. Here slumbers Rome, among her broken tombs, A funeral highway stretching down the past, With few inscriptions, save the constant blooms By kindly Nature on these altars cast. The dust of glory all around me lies, The ashes of dead nations and their kings: I hear no voice save what from out the skies The lark shakes down from his invisible wings. Where slept a CÃ¦sar, now the owlet hidesâ A silent spirit till the day has fled: Here gleams the lizard, there the viper glidesâ The steadfast guests of the patrician dead. A funeral aspect fills the whole campaignâ Their tomb-like flocks the distant mounds disclose: Like scattered blocks of granite on the plain, The dove-hued oxen Virgil sang repose. The cities seated on surrounding mounts, Or what were cities, glimmer on the steeps Like cemeteries, and the fancy counts In vain their dead for whom no mortal weeps. CÃ¦cilia's Tomb looks west to Hadrian's Mole In widowed silence: eastward, nameless, gray, Stripped of her marble art-embellished stole, The matron Mausoleum of the Way Sits with her crown of olives, robbed of all Save meek endurance and her vernal dome: Her grandeur tells of Rome before its fall, Her shattered splendor speaks of modern Rome. The broken masses quarried from her base To house a boor upon her head are thrust, Where dreamful sloth looks down upon the race Of heroes gone to history and dust. All Rome to-day sits on the buried past, Her later walls with sculptured blocks are flecked: The spoilers toiled for ages fierce and fast, Then left the rest to ruin and neglect. And still beneath their tread what wonders lie!â Brave statues of the godlike and their gods, And columns that might corridor the sky, While scarce a spade upturns the shallow clods. Unearth their marble wonders, with their high Immortal lessons, to awake men here, And elsewhere to arrest, as they sweep by, Ambition's armies in their mad career. Who to their chariots chain the fiery team Of elements to gain the realms of gold, Let them behold the more enduring dream Of Amphion-sculptors in the days of old. Exhume these silent teachers from the dust, And thenâBut hold! I see around me strewn, O'er miles and miles of ruins, a thick crust Of shattered remnants in dark ages hewn For wanton pastime or for kilns of lime! The very mortar in St. Peter's wall Hath had its votaries in that grand old time When Poesy and Art o'erlorded all. But that is past. What sound is this I hear More than the lark's? As from a mournful lyre A weird, complaining murmur fills my ear: I look above, and, lo! the Ã¦olian wire Sings in the wind. It is the lightning's track Stretching o'er sepulchres, which serve for posts; And yonder the swift train weaves forth and back. Thou highway of the dead! where are thy ghosts? The electric fire that reaches Rome to-day May give at best a poor galvanic thrillâ The train that streams along the iron way May bring but mourners to the sevenfold hill: All this may be, but still within me burns The prayerful dream and hope that even I May see her rise above her funeral urns, And throw her long-worn sack-cloth bravely by. There is a sad necropolis in the heart, A street of buried loves and joys and dreams. Where nest the night-owls, which will not depart. But hide the deeper when the daylight beams. And if a bird of hope sings overhead, Wooing to pleasures near or far away, They only wait the darkened hour to spread Their secret wings and swoop upon their prey. With many sighs breathed o'er these funeral heaps I sit like Mariusânot above the wall Of ruined greatness, but my spirit weeps O'er shattered fanes, where few are left to fall. There are to whom whole days of light are given, And fruitful seasons of unclouded joy, But not to me since through my childhood's heaven I wandered out a songful-hearted boy, Seeking the unscythed orchard with the beesâ A little taller than the clover then, With light hair blown like wings upon the breezeâ Long ere I knew the stubble-world of men. But this is vain; and yet the heart will sigh, At times adown her dark sepulchral way, Even when, as now, without a cloud the sky Is full of song that glorifies the day. And surely on these shrines of pain and care Some chords of pleasure, stretching from abroad, Reach to the soul's deep citadel, and there Bring messages of progress, peace, and God! Thus there is good in all, and over all, And e'en 'mid tombs some pleasure finds a place; And sympathies, that followed from our fall, On scenes like this may shed a soothing grace. So, 'mid these tumuli of long-gone years, A fruitful sadness on the spirit beamsâ A calm content to lie where all are peers When called, and sleep that sleep which knows no dreams. It matters little where our dust is laid; But if there be a choice beneath the dome Of heaven's high temple, lay me in the shade Of cypress boughs which guard the dead in Rome. And yet I love my country none the less: My faith fulfils her prophet's grandest dream, And when death wooes me to his cold caress, My hovering soul shall watch her course, supreme In spite of traitors and ambitious fools, Who threaten ruin to our soaring towers! The Master-Builder works with many tools When he erects a building such as ours. Who would destroy to profit by the spoils Are sturdy laborers in the eye of God: The mad aspirant on his ladder toils, Forgetting that he also bears a hod. The great and good have bled to make us free: Our rainbow banner, by their hands unfurled, Waves o'er the new-born nation, yet to be The mother of a liberated world. Her Appian Way shall be the road to Fame, And lined with many a Christian spire and dome: Her arch triumphal, reared in Freedom's name, Shall lead mankind, to nobler marts than Rome! May, 1870, Rome. THE HOUSE BY THE SEA. PART FIRST. TO HIRAM POWERS, AS AN EVIDENCE OF FRIENDSHIP AND ADMIRATION, THIS POEM IS INSCRIBED BY THE AUTHOR. Bagni di Lucca, Sept. 1, 1855. He told a tale as wild as sad; And they who listened deemed it madâ Mad as the delirious dream Of one who, on an Indian stream Floating in a Morphean barque, Feeds on the charmÃ©d lotus-leafâ While under the palms, in visions brief, Through shadows of sunset, golden-dark, The camels and camelopards stand With plumÃ©d tribes on the yellow sand, To gaze with steadfast, wondering eyes Where the feeding dreamer floating lies. I. On a little, seaward-sloping lawn, The first bright half-hour after dawnâ With golden hair and cheeks as red As the hue in the brightening orient spread, The child and the light of the fisherman's home, Bearing a pail that dript its foam Like snow-flakes on the wayside grass, Went singing as if her soul would pass Into the air, and o'ertake that bird Which sang in the sky less seen than heard. Her path was along the sweet-brier lane, Dividing the sea from the clover plain: Below, the billows inland bore And threw their foam-wreaths on the shore; Above, the orchards, lightly blown, Scattered their snowy garlands down, As if the very trees would spread A pure white path for her virgin tread. She plucked a violet from the hedge, And then a flower from the perilous edge Of a cliff where foamed the sea's white ire,â And now a bloom from the wayside brier; Then placed them in her russet vest, To sway to the heaving of her breast. Descending the steep of the sea-side rocks, In pathways worn by the shepherds' flocks, She saw the Stranger, whose cliff-perched home Stood higher than ever the wild sea-foam Could leap; and only the gust of spray, Seeking the cloud, passed up that way. It might be a moon of dawns, perchance, Since first the stranger met her glance, And never at any later time Than the crimson flush of the morning's prime, With the latest star he walked the shore, And when that failed was seen no more. They grew acquaintedâyet did not speak: There was a sadness on his cheek His smile made sadder; and his look Seemed to reflect some parchment book Writ in a cave by a wizard gray To spirit both body and soul away. Her heart's deep instinct read in his eye How he had sought that height to die; And, as one bears flowers of sweetest bloom To brighten a sick man's twilight room, When now they met, with resistless grace She stood before himâscarce looked in his face, Tendered the blossoms, then quickened her pace. He pressed them to his lips, and then Strolled round to his cloudy home again. He climbed to his airy balcony, That overbrowed the eastern sea: Like a spirit in a dusky cloud, O'erleaning the world in wonder bowed, Pale Roland leaned, and gazed below Into the gulfsâuntil on the flow Of the billows his fancies seemed to go: And thus to the air and the spirits of air, Those delicate listeners everywhere, He winged his thoughts with careless words, Till they sailed the ocean like sea-born birds. II. âMy house is built on the cliff's tall crest, As high as an eagle might choose her nest: The builders have descended the hill, Like spirits who have done their master's will. Below, the billows in endless reach Commune in uncomprehended speechâ A language stillâthere is no sound But symbols something, though unfound. âHere from the world I can safely lean And feel, if not hear, what the billows mean; And dropping this flower, I can watch it sway Till it diminishes into the spray. The little alien from its hill-side home Is clasped and whirled in the heartless foam! Oh, reckless hand! it was the flower The peasant-girl gave me this very hour! Well, it is goneâso let it be: Not Indus could restore to me, With all its dew and odor fine, Fresh and free from the bitter brine, That victim of a heedless hand! But it must be fretted along the sand Till drowned and crushed, a noisome thing At last, where the foulest sea-weeds cling! âThus with the maid it may be, perchance, Borne away from her vernal haunts To make some heartless breast look bright, Then carried to some dizzy height And dropt from a hand relentlessly Into the gulfs of a pitiless seaâ Into the tumultuous fret and foam To perishâan alien far from home! âHere I stand, like a Persian priest, Gazing forever into the east, And bow my head before the sun, The symbol of a mightier One. âBeheld from here, with march unending, By night and by day the sky is ascending; This is the vision of youthâthe scope Where rises the golden scale of Hope,â When the heart in its freshness stout and hale Recks not of the opposing scale, Which, though unseen in the future air, Sinks and sinks with its weight of despair. âNothing sets save yonder sail Chased away by an outward gale, And every hour to my straining gaze Some new barque issues through the haze,â Fresh, perchance, from the Orient, It sails with spicy breezes bent, Like that barge on the Cydnus seen Laden with odors that veiled a queen. It comes from what mysterious land? With freight of Bagdat or Samarcand? From under the guns of Arabian forts, Or out of Al-Raschid's golden ports? From India, or the barbarous isles Where the Pacific summer smiles? I envy the sea-bird sailing there In the trackless ocean of blue air; It can see and it can hear What may never meet my eye or ear. âI look to the eastâall things ascend, And with them the eye and the heart must tend,â Only the heavy earth opprest, Turning forever out of the west, Rolls down and down: the fancy feels The sinking, and the spirit reels! What was the east an hour ago Even while I gaze is no longer soâ I am plunging now through its azure veil, While another rises dim and pale, And this must shortly sink afar To hold in the west the evening star. âHere clinging we are daily cast Into the future, out of the past,â Through the sunshine into the night.â Through the darkness into the light. Thus we whirl in the noiseless stream, And the sky glides over us like a dream, Full of stars and mystery And prophecy of things to be. âThis very moment we hold a place Never filled before in spaceâ Where never again the world shall reelâ The same wave never revisits the wheel. Year by year our course is run In a voyage around the sun; In million circling forth and back We never retrace a once gone track. Did the countless earths abroad, like snails, Leave behind them shining trails, What a web of strange design Through the eternal space would shine! And such a web of marvellous lines Left by each satellite and sun, Though by us unseen, still clearly shines To the observant eye of One. âAnd did the countless souls of men Leave life-trails visible to the ken, Each hued with color to betray The character which passed that way, How intricate and variously-hued Would seem the woof of pathways rude Across the world's great surface laid! And so inwoven with lines of shade, Of vice and cruelty, anger and hate, That darkness would preponderate! And such a woof of tangled trails Lies o'er the world and never palesâ Never varies. On earth's great page Each soul records its pilgrimage, And under the eye of God each shines As visible in eternal lines, As on the cliff I see from here The various strata-lines appear. âThank Heaven! my path shall no longer run With the common highways under the sun! From the ways of men it shall lie apart, On a new and a separate chart; No other foot shall e'er intrude In my skyey holds of solitude. Henceforth alone I walk afar In the dream which death shall scarcely mar, Far above the obtrusive ken And idle inquiry of men. Already I can hear rehearse The higher life of the universe, Commune with those spirits whose white tents Are never stirred by these elements, Camped on the dim ethereal fields With meteor banners and starry shields! âAnd now my sole companion shall be My sorrow embodied; and, hermit-like, we Will renounce the world and rest at ease, Content with our own sweet sympathies. Tell me no more of that larger plan, The charity for and the faith in man: I have tried it well, and ever found The seven sins filling its utmost bound! And they who live in the world must be One with the world, or content to see Their dearest rights and their holiest trust With heels of steel trampled into the dust! All this I have suffered, and scarcely restrained At times the revenge whose swift blow would have gained The bad world's respect, and left me exempt A little from all save my soul's self-contempt. I was as a weed that is chafed on the beach; But, Heaven be praised! being thrown out of reach, I have taken firm root in the cliff, where no more The billows affright with their roll and their roar. I have tasted the best which the world can bestow, But friendship turned bitterâlove ended in woe! âIn the school of envy, and malice, and strife, I have studied and learned the lesson of life; Studied it well from that dreary hour When the dark-hearted Fates had power, Ministering at my birthâwho threw Upon my brow their black baptismal dew! From that sad night what time my spirit's barque, Sailing over the sea of space, In a moment ominous and dark, Was stranded on this desert place,â This treacherous reef of time, This rank and poisonous clime Called earth, where savage men In hut or palace make their hateful den,â I have known little peace and less of joy! And even when a pleasure-seeking boy, Unlovely faces with distempered tongue Were my attendants, and they ever hung Inseparably about me, like the shades From a baleful torchlight flung, Which the torch-bearer not evades Until the light be drenched And in the oblivious sea of death and darkness quenched. And I have borne this torchâ This flickering lifeâand still must bear, Watching it flaunt and flare, Where all my hopes, like night-moths, fly and scorch Their airy pinions, till their writhing forms Drop round my feet a mass of wingless worms! âBut, lo! the tempest of the world is past! Its passion-bolts are no longer cast About me, and I feel as one Who stands to gaze when life is done! Even the peasant with her bright blue eye Seemed but the remnant of a cloud gone by; Or rather let me deem her form The farewell rainbow of the storm. I am glad that in leaving this gallery Of horrors that have frowned on me, A living thing so pure and bright Should have closed the hateful place from sight. âHow sweet it is to find release In this aÃ«rial tower of peace! In this antechamber of the sky Next to the halls of eternityâ With only one thin door between This and the outer world serene, Waiting to take that one step more When opens the celestial door, And then, with the sudden splendor blind, Hear the great portals close behind!â III. 'Twas evening, and he mounted high Up to the terrace that faced the sky. The fisherman, in his boat below Swinging to the billows' flow, Beheld him like a guard of old On a dusky towerâa shadow bold Standing against the sundown gold. There Roland watched the dome of day In a conflagration fall away, And saw the first white star that sped To gaze at the sunset ere it fled. Westward he saw the spires and domes Overtopping the noisy homes Of toil and trade, but all so far He felt no tremor of the jar That like a daily earthquake rolls Through the world of dust-bound souls. Out of the east the moon arose Red as Mont Blanc at morning glows; Over the sea, like a ship on fire, She sailed with her one star sailing by her. Long, long he gazed, till he felt the might And glory that pervade the night. Awhile he looked upon the seas, Then gazed to the shadowy orchard trees, And saw the fisherman's quiet home Sitting under the vernal dome Of one great elm, where the fire-flies played With their feast of lanterns nightly made. He saw the various shadows pass Over the illumined glass,â Saw tapers, moving to and fro, From window to window come and go, Like those lights which phantom hands Wave at night o'er marshy lands,â Saw the maid at her casement lean, And her shade steal into the night serene. âThus from the casements of life,â he mused, âOur shadows are outward cast, confused Into a greater shade. What eye Shall trace these phantoms where they fly? None:âAnd it much behooves us all That the lights from whence these shadows fall Should be guarded well and trimmed with care, That the flame shall neither sink nor flare, Protected from the fitful gusts Blown from the lips of Caliban lusts.â Here and there a meteor fleet, Struck from the invisible feet Of Night's wild coursers, fierce and black, Streamed over the star-paven track: Or it may be this voiceless levin, Launched from the unseen clouds of heaven, Are bolts by spirit-tempests hurled Into a purgatorial world; Or they may be in the fields of blue Offsprings of nameless damps and dew,â Celestial will-o'-wisps at play, Leading benighted souls astray. Midnight was near. With a look divine He saw the maid at her chamber shrine. Two little tapers with flaming wicks Burned beside a crucifix. And while she prayed, it seemed Over her face a splendor beamed,â A light of purity and grace Shed from the suffering Saviour's face. Her angel look was upward turned; Her white breast heaved as if it yearned To breathe her very soul away In a prayer which words had failed to say. Her upturned faceâher fallen hair, Her hands clasped on her bosom fair, Her heaving breast but half concealed, The fulness of her prayer revealed. As the watcher gazed, he felt his brain Branded with a forgotten pain; And thoughts he had deemed frozen, dead, Warmed snakelike, by his heart's flame fed, Till thus the voice of a demon guest With scornful laugh its joy expressed:â âThe hawk looks down on the ring-dove's nest; He loves her meek voice and her smooth meek breast! And the beautiful bird shall still be as meek When her red heart quivers in the falcon's beak!â âHorrible fiend!â he cried, in pain, âBack to your baneful den again! Oh, Death, stand by me in this hour, And strike me ere the fiend have power! Have I not, with a terrible oath, On the breast of the dying sworn my troth? Did I not swear when Death was at strife, In the white dome of her bosom, with Life,â Though I had wronged her living trust,â To be true, ay, as true as the tomb to her dust? For this she forgave the great wrong I had wrought, And mingled my name in her last sweet thought, And promised that, in an hour of fear, Her soul should be as a guardian near!â As he spoke, the great tears swam over his gaze, Till the white moon reeled in delirious haze, And the stars were unsteady as gust-winnowed chaffâ Still his innermost soul heard the mad demon laugh. âLook! look again!â Thus cried the fiend, âOne look before the vision is screenedâ Oh, never was Parian so fair to the sight! Oh, never such beauty pulsed love through the night!â But still the pale man, like some martyr who dies, Looked into the sky with fixed agonized eyes. Sighing, âIda! dear Ida! The hour of fear, Like a tiger in wait for its prey, crouches here! I see its red eyes, and I feel its hot breath!â Come forth, thou sweet friend, from the gateways of Death! Press me closeâside to sideâsoul to soulâmind to mindâ Or lead through that path thou too early didst find!â As he spoke, soft lips, like sunshine warm, Kissed from his brow the late alarmâ Pale delicate arms his neck caressed, And the head of a spirit was laid on his breast! The silken hair that fell unfurled Still gleamed with the hue of another world: So soft were her tresses, each breath of the gale Caressed them in air like a gossamer veil; And her garments still breathed of ethereal dew In fields where no mortal has ever passed through. Then the fiend exclaimed with louder jeersâ While the spirit pressed her hands to her ears, And gazed with that imploring look Which only a demon's eye could brookâ âThis hour, thou wretched ghost! is thineâ But the next and the next shall all be mine! The cup is brewing which he shall quaff, While the angels shall weep and the fiends shall laugh! Then thou shalt be scourged away with scorn Into the outer dark forlorn, And a mortal head usurp the breast Which late thy phantom cheek has prest! Blood warms to bloodâdust cleaves to dustâ And in that hour depart thou must. Thou dead leaf on a midnight gust!â Then even as a pale dead leaf Still clinging where its hour is brief, The spirit-lady in her grief Shuddered and sighed, as if even now The wind was plucking her from the bough. âO Roland!â she cried, âthere's one hour of dread, Blackening like that cloud o'erhead; A bitter wind is rising fast, Like this which brings the ocean blast!â âIt shall not be!â the bold man cried; âNo wind shall bear thee from my side! Let us descend to the altar shrine, And kneel before the cross divine. 'Tis an altar by repentance built, In memory of my former guilt, That a daily prayer might there be made, To ransom thy departed shade.â Then they descended. The east winds came, Trampling the sea into phosphor flame, Which filled the black arch of the night With sheeted flashings of spectral light. And every maniac ocean-gust Scattered the feathery foam, like dust, Into the airâagain and again Flinging on the window-pane White briny flakes, in rage and spite, As if to drown the altar light. IV. Still leaning on her lover's breast, The spirit thus her crime confessed:â âO Roland! from too much loving thee. From fear thou wert not wholly mine, My lips partook of misery, And left for thee that bitter wine Pressed in the dark from woe's black vine! âI drained the cup that drowns with sleep, And pillowed my head on the breast of Death: He closed the lids that ceased to weep, And kissed the lips at their latest breath! That moment I had untimely birth Out of the chrysalis of earth! Then I saw that by the horrible deed The chain was sundered, yet I was not freed; I had burst away from a windowed cell Into a dungeon unfathomableâ Into utter nightâwhere I could only hear The sighing of cold phantoms near! I shrank with dread; but soon I knew They also shrank with dread from me; And presently I began to see Thin shapes of such a ghastly hue That sudden agues thrilled me through! âSome bore in their hands, as sign of guilt, Keen poniards crimson to the hilt, Which, ever and anon, in wild despair They struck into their breasts of air: Some pressed to their pale lips empty vials Till frenzied with their fruitless trials: Some, with their faces to the sky, Walked ever searching for a beam. Some leaped from shadowy turrets high, And fell, as in a nightmare dream, Half-way, and stopped, as some mad rill, That leaps from the top of an alpine hill, Ere it reaches the rocks it hoped to win, Is borne away in a vapor thin: Some plunged them into counterfeit poolsâ Into water that neither drowns nor cools The horrible fever that burns the brain, Then climbed despairing to plunge again: And there were lovers together clasped, O'er fumeless braziers, who sighed and gasped, Staring wonder in each other's eye, And tantalized that they did not die. âThen as I passed, with marvelling stare They gazed, forgetting their own despair. Oh, horrible! their eyes did gloat Upon me, till at my ashen throat I felt the fiery viper thirst Which ever in that dry air is nurst. And, ere I was aware, I had raised the cup it was mine to bear: My pale lips cleaved to the goblet dim, And found but dust on the heated rim; And then I knewâoh, misery!â It was the same I had pledged to theeâ To absent thee, and to present Death, Pledged and drained at one long-drawn breathâ Drained to the dregs! Then a hot wind sighed Close in my earââThou suicide!â And those two words flew Into my heart, and pierced it through; And my eyes grew blind with pain As a serpent which, with rage insane, Strikes himself with venomed fangs, And writhes in the dust with self-dealt pangs. Then in my agony's wild excess I partly swooned, and the pain grew less; While a form, not all devoid of kindness, Seemed leaning o'er me in my blindness, And whispered in my aching ear Words which then were sweet to hear. ââHast thou no friend?â the spirit said, âWho would rejoice wert thou not dead? Who in his heart would call thee back Into the world's green, visible track? If such an one there be, Whose soul yearns constantly for thee, Hearken, and when his voice is heard Breathing one recalling word, Arise and hasten, the veil is then Lifted, and thou mayst return again! And it shall be thy fate, perchance, To see the long dull years advance, And still a bloodless ghost to be For many a weary century, When all whom thou hast loved are fled Into the regions overhead. Then drearier far that world will be, With its homes and haunts reminding thee Of the loved and lost, than even this, Where the vampire Pain enthronÃ©d is. But be thou ever wary and wise, Gazing with unsleeping eyes, And thou, perchance, shalt find ere long Some spirit, racked with sin or wrong, Aweary of Life's daily goad And sinking under her dusty load, Who, with rash and desperate hand, Is about to sever the mortal band Which binds her down, as once didst thou, To be the shadow which thou art now. At such an hour be thou then near, And when the spirit shall disappear, And the deserted form Lies beside thee, silent, warm, Like a suit of mail in hot disdain Discarded on a battle-plain, Don thou that heated armor then, And strive with the striving world again! And through long struggling it may be Thou mayst regain thy liberty!â âThus spake the spirit. Then it seemed A sudden light within me beamed; And I arose and earthward sped With a cautious, noiseless tread, Hearkening ever for that voice To make my phantom heart rejoice. âThrough fields of twilight first I passed. Then through a sunsetâtill at last I heard the roar Of ocean jargoning with the shore,â The sea-like voice of humanity, And the tongue-like shouting of the sea! Then, as the night's wide track Under my feet rolled dim and black, I heard the voice which summoned me, âIda!â it cried, and I came to thee!â V. Who that has heard the billows roar On the rocky bastions of the shore, Could restrain the sense of sublimity Which drew him to overlook the seaâ One sea with the terror of many seas! And held him with the mysterious law Of wonder and soul-pervading awe, And sympathy, the child of these? Out to the foamy balcony, Where the phospor light And the black of the night Struggled in gloomy rivalry, Strode Rolandâhis cloak and hair Twitched by the briny hands of air, And all his dusk garb instantly Made white with the insult of the sea! Burning through the eastern dark, At the bow of a perilous barque, Rising with alternate leap Out of the valleys of the deep, He beheld a crimson light Driving shoreward through the night,â Watched it as the lurid flame Straight to its destruction came! On it drove before the gale, With empty mast or shivered sail; And Roland shuddered in his fear As he saw it neither tack nor veer, And trembled to think of a crowded deck Dashed at his feet a shapeless wreck! A shock! A shriek! The light was drowned! And the billows leaped with a higher bound! And the skyward spray the instant after Was stunned with the ocean's scornful laughter! Then, bewildered with pain and fright, Roland descended the stormy height, Finding his way by the phosphor light, To seek amid the wild uproar The drowning bodies thrown on shore. Suddenly at his feet a form Lay like an offering from the storm! White as a stranded wreath of foam, White as a ghost from its charnel home, It lay where the gust with blinding flight Strove to hide the shape from sight, Like a maniac murderer, to and fro Raving and flinging the scattering snow Over the victim that mocks his despair With its unveiled face and tell-tale stare! A moment the brave man's heart recoiled, Then he lifted the body and upward toiled. VI. It was a sight both wild and dread To see the living for the deadâ One stubborn and unaided formâ Battling with an ocean storm,â Toiling up the jagged path, Chased by the billows in their wrath, Bearing the dripping shape away Which the sea had deemed its prey. Thus laden, Roland among the rocks Strove upward 'mid the desperate shocks Of wind and waveâclimbing a track As crooked as that on the tempest's wrack, Where the armÃ©d Thunder in his ire Descends in a zigzag path of fire! The long black hair Of the drownÃ©d form he strove to bear, Flashed abroad on the wet sea-air, Wild as the tresses of Despair: And he thought, as he gazed on the drooping head Where the writhing locks were so wildly spread, Of the twisted horrors Medusa woreâ And a shudder pierced him to the core. But now he heard, or deemed he heard, The sound of that most piteous word, That only word the full heart knows To syllable its joys and woes,â A sigh! Like a night-bird sweeping near, Its soft wing fluttered past his ear, And he felt the heave of the rounded breast Which close against his own was prest: Then through his frame he took new strength, And with upward toiling gained at length The gusty height! A moment there, While the lightning lent its sheeted glare, That group stood in the misty air Like statues on a terrace high, Relieved on a dusky wall of sky. VII. Into the care of a gray-haired crone, The sibyl who tended his dull hearth-stone, He yielded the body. A couch was spread. And the lady was laid as she were not dead; And the dame from off the swooning face Smoothed the wet locks into their place; And Roland, when the salt sea-spray Which blurred his vision was cleared away, Holding a white torch, bent to trace The features of that sleeping face. His heart stood still! His blood ran chill! His wide eyes could not gaze their fill! And as his marvelling face was drawn Nearer and nearer to stare thereonâ Slowlyâslowly as a veil Lifted from a phantom's visage pale, The lady's delicate lids were raised, And in Roland's face the soft orbs gazed With all that touching tenderness Which only loving eyes express. He had clasped the ghost of his beloved, And not a tremor in his soul was movedâ From lips of air had taken the kiss, With not a fear to mar the bliss,â And heard what the threatening demon said, With a pang of pain but not of dread! But now an icy horror stole Through the deepest depths of his inmost soul; For here indeed was the risen dead For whom the funeral tears were shed! A spectre of dust!âa ghost of clay!â That lived when the spirit had passed away. He trembled, but could not move or speak: He had gazed in those eyes till his will was weak. Then the lady sighed, and her bosom heaved, And she faintly smiled, as her heart was grieved; While the thought of pain which shadowed her brow Said, âRoland, ah! Roland, thou lovest me not now!â When a great tear stole from under her lid, And rebukingly over her white cheek slid: Then Roland cried as he clasped her hand, â'Tis a dream that I cannot understand! Forgive me, dear Ida, if even I seem To wrong thy sweet shade in the dark of a dream!â âOh, joy! Thou hast called me âdear Ida,ââ she cried, And she lovingly drew him more close to her side. That voiceâ'twas the same he had heard in gone days, While she poured in his eyes as of old her soft gaze. Then she sighedââAh! dear Roland, a vision it seems?â To me 'tis the sweetest of all waking dreams! And let me recount in this hour of bliss How I fled out of the past into this, Escaping from Death's black precipice. VIII. âFar back in that dark desperate hour, When the swart mandragore had power,â While the suicidal draught, like flame, Through all the galleries of my frame Spread its malignant fireâeven then I repented and prayed for life againâ Not from the torture; but that I knew, When it seemed too late, that thou wert true. âAnd then I swooned, and heard the tread Of muffled feetâwhile sad hearts said, In sighs and whispers, âShe is dead! is dead!â And then I knewâoh, woe was me!â That word was a shaft of pain to thee, A shaft which I had winged with flame And spedâand yet could not reclaim! I saw thy high soul with the blow Struck to the dreary plains of woe, Yet struggling in its fall, as when An eagle, sailing with sunward ken, Receives from the heartless archer's bow The envious arrow winged from below. âThen I felt thy hasty farewell kiss,â A touch of mingled torture and bliss; And my soul within me writhed with pain That I could not return that kiss again. And then you fled! I heard the door Swing loud behindâand heard no more. My very soul then swoonedâand all Was blacker than midnight's starless pall. And more I know notâtill a long cool breath Came into my breast and chased out Deathâ Or that dark sleep which did counterfeit Black Death so well, that I scarcely yet Can realize the miracle Which finds me freed from his dreamless spell. âThen I awoke, and saw the room Tricked out with all the pompous gloom Of funeral weedsâthe air was sick With incense-fumes suspended thick And blue, as at morn o'er a stagnant lake Swings the venomous mist ere the winds awake. There I saw two tapers with fiendish glare Burning in the ghastly air; And my breast with horrible pain was weighed, As if by the weight of a black dream made. I found it was a cross of gold Which lay on my bosom so heavy and coldâ A cross entwined with lily-bells, And framed in a wreath of immortelles. A garland of flameâa cross of fireâ And I outstretched on a martyr's pyre Had been less terrible!âSo at last, By struggling I grew strong, and cast These emblems of death from off my breast, And, breathing, felt no more opprest. âThen you should have heard the shriek Of Death's stout ward'ress!âPale and weak, She reeled and tottered beyond the door, And fell in a fit on the marble floor. She awoke a maniacâher hair turned grayâ And a maniac she goes to this very day. âThen the household and the priest came inâ The priest in his robe as black as sin!â All shuddered and shrank; till I rose and smiled, When they rushed to my side with wonder wild, And cried, in their mingled joy and dread, âShe lives! Our Ida is not dead!â IX. âDays passed, and daily I asked for thee, Till at last they pointed over the sea, And said, in the madness of thy despair Thy barque had followed the red sun there. For hours they had watched the westward sail Growing in the distance pale, And sinking till beyond the line Of the flaming, sunset-gilded brine It set, like a star,âand never more Came tidings of that barque to shore. âThen with a grief too great for speech, I wandered daily to the beach With one companion gray and old, A reverend friarâwho hourly told His âAvesâ as we walked the sandâ And the pious tears, on his sunbrown hand His old eyes dropped, outcounted the beads As he thought of my sorrow! My poor heart bleeds That these tearful eyes shall no more win A sight of that saintly Capuchin! âAt last we found A little shallop westward bound; The daintest thing that ever yet Was on the treacherous ocean set. Under the prow we read her name, Written in ciphers of golden flame,â âThe Fire-Bearer.â Each letter did make, The semblance of a twisted snake,â One with the other all intervolved, Like a riddle that is slowly solved. âWhat ails the dame? What thus can make Her eyes so wide and her limbs to quake?â The crone replied, with a look of awe, âForgive me, lady, I thought I sawâ My sight is dim,â 'Twas a foolish whim,â But I thought I saw a fiery snake, A little streak of flame just there Writhing through your tangled hair!â The lady smiled, and gathered in Her tresses betwixt her breast and chin; And thus pursued the delirious theme, While Roland listened like one in a dream:â âSo near the shallop tacked and sailed, That in a desperate moment I hailed The skipper, who leaned against the helm, Looking the lord of the watery realm. Round went the rudder,âthe sail went round; And the light barque neared like a leaping hound; But, seeing what I had done, I sunk And swooned on the breast of the dear old monk! âThen, half awaking, I felt the motion Beneath me of a summer ocean, And dimly heard a voice of glee Singing some ballad about the sea!â 'Twas the skipper's voice, as the helm he prest, Heading the shallop out to the west! âThe Capuchin was at my side, Or else for very fear I had died. There we sat on deck, in the breezy shade By the one tall lateen canvas made.â Still flashing on in our track of foam When the venturous sea-gull turned for home. âThus dreamily sitting, for many a day Under the bow we heard the spray. And watched our backward path of white, And gazed on its liquid fire by night. âUnder us eastward the sea went by, Over us westward went the skyâ The sun and the moon and those silver barques, Those soul-freighted celestial arks. The starry fleets of the shoreless night, Were the only things that surpassed our flight! As a swallow chases the summer, we sped, Chasing the days that before us fled. X. âThen came the calmâwe called it soâ But the skipper knew, as now we know, That it was only the hungry Storm, Crouching back with his awful form, The better that he might spring and light Down on the unsuspecting night! âThe sail was furled,âthe hatch made fast,â And the friar and I sat close to the mast. Then came the dark and the roaring gale, And we sailed as an autumn leaf might sail, Blown by a loud tornado gustâ And the spray was like a blinding dust. âThen to the shivering mast we clung Still closerâwhile the friar's tongue Over his paternosters ran As only a pious friar's can; And my trembling lips, again and again, Strove vainly to respond âamen. âThe hard old skipper laughed outright To behold us clinging to the mast in fright. Till suddenly he cried, âLand ho!â And we saw in the west the crimson glow Of a light-houseâor what we deemed was so! âFiercer and fiercer the loud gale came, Driving us onward toward the flame. The skipper strove to change our course, Pressing the helm with giant force:â Battling a moment 'twixt rudder and gale, The light ark shuddered like a veering sailâ Then a crash!âand a curse!âo'er the stern of the barque The helm and the helmsman plunged into the dark! And the shallop leaped forth to the black unknown, With the joy of a steed when his rider is thrown! Spurning the waves and the wind's control, On, on it sped to its direful goal! I hid my face in the old man's breast: And thenâand thenâyou know the rest! âOh, Roland, a fearful dream was mineâ Those swooning moments among the brine! I saw thee stand in a midnight tower, And a beautiful fiend had thee in her power. I saw her pale lips pressed to thine; I saw ye kneel at an altar-shrine; And then I heard your mingled prayer, That, like a raven croaking in air, Hung black and ominous, but did not soar! And then you named her by my name, And that hot word clung to my heart like flame Slung from a torch! And I heard no more! âOh, Roland, wherefore tremble so? Or wherefore stoops your brow so low? Oh, dreary hour! oh, woe is me! If this terrible dream should prove to be The shadow of mad reality! Look up, and assure me it is not soâ Or let me die with the sudden blow Of the horrible truth! At thy command Death shall strike with most welcome hand. âOh, woe is me! Oh, woe is me! Would I were lying under the sea! Or would that dear old friend were here Who sleeps so low on his briny bier, To mount with thee to that sinful place To meet the demon face to face, With exorcism and with prayer To scourge her into the utmost air!â XI. Was it the sound of a human cry, Or wail of a night-bird driven by? The lady started and half-way rose, With that look the walking sleeper shows,â With large eyes staring vacantly, That seem to listen and not to see. Then, with a tongue of pitiful glee, She cried, âO Roland, if that should be The voice of my friend so old and gray, Struggling among the rocks and spray! âThere, did you not hear? that wild cry through the roar! Hark again! It is his! Wave the torch at the door And beacon him in! Oh, I faint as I think, Perchance how he clings to some terrible brink!â Even while she spoke, as if at her will, The door swung wide, and over the sill The gust and the roar and the spray swept in, Like a crew of wild pirates, with insolent din; And suddenly a group of three Toiled breathlessly after, all dripping the sea. There came the monk in his robe of brown, Over his breast his white beard blown And sparkling like a burst of foam; As if old Neptune should leave his home, To traverse the dry land up and down Disguised in a friar's hood and gown. And, bearing a lantern, so covered with spray That the light could scarcely emit a ray, Came the fisherman, whose sturdy arm Had rescued the pious man from harm. There, too, was the maiden, the fisherman's child, With her glowing cheeks and eyelids mild. For many a mile about the coast, That father and child were the country's boast, And many a sailor on a far-off deck Remembered Agatha and the wreck. Fame fondly pictured their struggling forms Battling against the blackest storms. Through day or dark they might be found Braving the tempest in their round; And thus to-night they had met the storm, And rescued from death this saintly form. That moment there Was a living picture bold and rare, With its massive lights and shadows thrown From the torch in the hands of the withered crone, Exalted above her own wild hair, Which streamed like the shreds of a banner in air, Tattered, confused, as if torn in the strife Of the seventy years' war waged by Death against Life. The lady arose with joy and ran And fell on the breast of the ancient man; And wept such tears as a child might shed On the breast of a parent just saved from the dead. Then from her heart of gratitude She thanked the fisherman, where he stood Gazing on her with marvelling face, As if in some enchanted place He stood, with uncontrollÃ©d sight, Chained to a vision of delight. And then she seized the daughter's hand: A moment her large eyes softly scanned The modest maid, with look as mild As a mother casts on her beauteous child, Conscious that its face confers A ray of splendor back to hers; Then drawing her near with a smile of bliss, Pronounced her thanks in a tender kiss. Suddenly pale grew the maiden's lips, And her soul was veiled with a deep eclipse; And she sunk at the old monk's feet with dread, Begging his blessing to rest on her head, And cried, âOh, let me see and touch The CROSS, which we cannot kiss too much! And count one prayer on the beads divine!â And the old monk murmured, âMy blessing is thine.â While he laid his hand on her shining hair; But it seemed like a fiery gauntlet there! Then tracing his girdle and fumbling his dress, He cried, with a visage of deep distress, âOh, woe is me! They are lost in the seaâ That miracle cross and rosary! Torn from my side in those desperate shocks When the billows were lifting me over the rocks. Oh, woe is me! They were made from a tree In the garden of holy Gethââ Here the sea, Through the open door, hurled into the place Such a cloud of spray that the old man's face Was smothered with brine. The white torch hissed, And all the room was blind with the mist. Then thrice the maiden, with look distressed, Signed the cross on her brow and breast, And thus to the friar her fear confessed: âI feel in my soul what I cannot say; But something so wicked has blown this way, That I cannot choose but shudder and shrink, As if I were dragged to a horrible brink. A demon is breathing this very air, Which can only be banished afar with prayer!â The monk bent soothingly over her form, And said, âBe calm, my child, it is only the storm; Take cheer, take cheer! It is only the loud wind shrieking near. The wind and the night and the sea Are all that be Abroad to fill the soul with fear.â XII. The lady, who heard what the maiden had said, As dizzy with pain, clasped her hands to her head; While her white bosom heaved as with heart-broken sighs, And she turned upon Roland her pitiful eyes; And he read in her visage of pallid dismay Far more than her language of sorrow could say. âOh, the terrible dream! It is trueâit is true! And a beautiful demon there waiteth for you! For you! Roland, you! and I to be left In a poisonous world, of all comfort bereft!â âThough I die it shall vanish!â the desperate man cried, âNo demon shall hold me away from thy side!â The torch half-way dwindledâthe crone muttered and moanedâ The maid hid her face, and her deep bosom groaned! Then seizing the monk, like one in despair, Roland led through the hall to the shadowy stair; And said, while ascending, âLet thy holy words be A scourge which shall drive this fiend into the sea! Ay, into its own native sea of black pain, So deep it shall never turn earthward again!â Then the monk's pious pleasure burst to laughter aloud, Like a hot gust that blows the red leaves in a cloud; And he cried, âBy the Pope, whose brown livery I wear, It shall frighten the night with its shriek of despair! And when my Pope hears the good deed I have done, He will call me to kneel at his great crimson throne; And, knowing the height of all priestly desire, He will crown this old brow with the sacred attire Of a cardinal's hatâflaming scarlet as fire! âNo monarch is half so sublime as our Pope! You will visit our Rome and behold him, I hope;â You will find him enthroned in magnificent state,â His brow overweighed with the burthensome weight Of care for the souls of mankind! You will see The great of all nations there bending the kneeâ Proud kings and their courts in their splendor replete, Like an ocean of flame, surging up to his feet;â All so eagerly crowding to press on his shoe The kiss of allegiance, that the place through and through Grows oppressively heatedâbesides, as you know, Our Rome's a warm climateâexcessively so! âYou will probably go there in carnival time,â And see what no pencil, however sublime, Could picture with justice. If one did not know That the thing was a sanctioned and sanctified show, One might deem he had passed into Lucifer's regions, And think he saw hell pouring out its red legions! Indeed, they do say, that beneath his black dome The Devil does try to imitate Rome! But this is rank scandalâyou see what I meanâ In no place but Rome can you find such a scene. âAnd then, oh! those gorgeous great festival nights, When the huge dusky dome is one fabric of lights, Done with marvellous skill, which naught baffles or mars,â A temple of flame!âa mosaic of stars! âBelieve me, nowhere are such fireworks known, As you'll find in our Rome. Quite distinct and alone They stand; for the artist who plans them is one In that line of business not easily outdone!â XIII. They gained the stormy balcony Where the light from the chamber streamed out to the sea. What ailed the friar, that he seemed to fail And grasped for support on the shadowy rail? Why did he shiver and seem so faint? Was it that, like a beautiful saint, He beheld the spirit-lady kneeling With mild eyes full of tears and feeling, Clasping on her bosom fair The crucifix, which piously there Rose and fell on the tide of prayer? âI am very old and nigh to death, And climbing that stairway has taken my breath!â He murmured at last:ââAh me! ah me! I am very weak from the abuse of the sea! And the chilly wet is piercing me through As if I had slept in a poisonous dew, And awoke with all the horrible pains Which death can inflict with chills and blains! âIt will pass anon:âmeantime do thou Secure the precious moment nowâ Go seize on that polluted cross, And into the sea, with a curse and a toss, Fling it afar, as you would fling Some black, dead, offensive thing, Hurled away with fierce disdain, Never to be reclaimed again! And thenâand thenâoh! this terrible chill, Piercing me like an electric thrill In a cavern of ice!âThe punishing ire Ofâour abbot, though wielding great lashes of fire, Were easier to bear than this shiver intense, Like icicles piercing the innermost sense!â Then take thou this girdle, which grasp like a scourge, And wield through the room!âIt hath power to purge The air from such envious spirits as this, Who would rob even hell of its last ray of bliss!â Then Roland, with averted head, Strode in and did as the friar said; He seized the crossâthrough the open door It spun to the dark and the wild uproar! The spirit arose with a shriek of woe, Crying, âThis is the storm! It must be so! The same I foretold thee an hour ago! Though thou comest, O Roland! as one in swift ire, And armed with those red hissing scourges of fire: Oh! know, Roland, know that the fiends of the pit, The Arachnes of woe, are all weaving their wit In webs to ensnare thee! Already thy will Is tangled, confused in the threads of their skill: Ere thou strike I departâyet again and again My hand shall be laid on thy forehead of pain. And when thou hast passed through this fiery test, When reason and calm have re-entered thy breast, Again will I sit by thy side, and renew The chain which the demons have sundered in two.â Ere the red scourge was lifted, the spirit had flown With a sigh in the air, and then followed a groan, And Roland dropt down with the weight of a stone. And the monk, leaning o'er him, breathed into his ear Thoughts without words, which his spirit in fear Beheld as black tangible visions at strife, Struggling which should be foremost to poison his life. Down in the shadowy hall below, The maid and the fisher were turning to go, When the lady with a mild command, With language sweet and countenance bland, Recalled the maiden, and, seizing her hand, Pressed it to her bosom white And cold as a marble tomb at night; And murmured in accents sweet and mild, âWe must be friendsâdear friendsâmy child! And in token of this, this little ring, Quite a simple yet sacred thing, I place on your finger. It is, you see, The emblem of wisdom and eternity; And a symbol of what our love must beâ Wise, watchful, unendingâthat hereafter we, Even in a future clime May look backward to the realms of time, And say it was upon that night When the heavens were black and the seas were white, We plighted the faith that shall never grow cold, And linked our two souls with this serpent of gold!â PART SECOND. I. Wandering over the summer plain, Like one gone, for love, insane, And gathering through field and lane Those wild blooms whose breath is bane, Passed Agatha, her golden hair More golden in the noonday air, Fluttering free from the wonted braid Which her hand no longer made; But twined with such wild vines and weeds As the rank marsh and woodland breeds: And, like pale Autumn when she grieves, Her brow was bound with crimson leaves Plucked from the woodbine, and her breast In a scarf of withered vines was drest; Her cheeks were white, her eyes were bright, And full of supernatural light. Oh, Heaven! it is a sight to make The heart of the stoutest stoic ache, To see a maid so young and fair Decked in the garments of despair! Like a statued sorrow, overrun With garlands yellowing in the sun. And thus as she gathered the leaves and flowers Fit only to deck the forbidden bowers Wherein some pale enchantress fiend In noxious odors is veiled and screened, She murmured her fancies as they came Out of her brain like wings of flame:â âThey are gone, all the blooms by the wild April strown In the pathway of May; For the passionate breath of the Summer has blown Their leaves to decay. âAnd the flowers of childhood must wither and fall, And pine unto death, When the summer of passion breathes over them all Its feverish breath. âWhere the violets out from the green hedges stole, Unnoticed to shine, The poppy is waving its fiery bowl, A bowl of red wine. âThese goblets of crimson, these beakers of sleep, Each a chalice of flame, I will pluck for my lady, her soul they shall steep In desires without name. âAnd the berries that burn on the poisonous vine, Like embers blown red, I will gather and string, and gayly entwine Round her beautiful head. âFrom this wild ivy-climber, that strangles the tree And robs it of green, I will weave for my lady a garland, and she Shall be crowned like a queen. âOnce I knew where to find the most beautiful blooms When the year was at noon, Those delicate spirits called out of their tombs By the trumpet of June:â âNow the daisies and buttercups fade at my touchâ And even the sweet-brier, That wild parent of roses my heart loved so much, Now wilts in my hand as if held in the clutch Of fingers of fire. âOh, this beautiful ring! and this gem in its head So scarlet and bright! I feel a soft warmth through my quick pulses shed With a sense of delight! Like a spark caught from Mars, as lovely and red It burns in the night! âSince I knew the fair donor, a wonderful change Has mantled the earth: The summer goes by, and no longer I range Through its bowers of mirth. âThe birds have grown hateful that sing in the light; No longer I hark To any save those which talk madness all night To the fiery-eyed dark! âThou gem, let me press thee again and again With a passionate kiss! Oh! a pleasure inflames me that almost is pain, The pain of pure bliss!â II. Like a shell among the rocks, A tempest-stranded nautilus, Wrecked but not ruined by the shocksâ Lifted and lodged from dangerâthus The dainty barque was found, Sitting upright, safe and sound, Like a vessel on the stocks, Waiting but to feel The loosening hammers at her keel To launch upon the sea And leap away to liberty, Like a captured swan set free. Already there were toiling men Laboring hard at the spars and ropes; And on the cliff, with anxious ken, Gazing with mingled fears and hopes, Stood Roland, with the lady's form Languidly leaning on his arm. There, too, with his beard and hair Swaying to the summer air, Stood the monk with mutterings low, That like the billows' mystical speech, Hissing, murmuring up the beach, Were poured in such a Babel flow None knew if they were prayers or noâ Save the lady, who ever and anon Responded till the monk was done. Still laboring at the ropes and spars, Yo-heaving, like a group of tars, Toiled the men; but the firm-set keel Clung to the rock like magnet to steel. Whereat the monk, as if in wrath, Hurried down the zigzag path. In the breeze his white beard shook, Like the foam of a mountain brook. He laid his shoulder against the keel, At once she began to stagger and reel. âAgain!â he cried, âand all together!â And, like a steed that has broken its tether, Away she sped with a bound and a quiver, Making the cloven water shiver With the sudden blow! And then she wheeled, Restively pawing the watery field, Angered to feel the clinging check Of the shoreward cable about her neck. The sea, to one of its slumberous calms, Now sunk as it never would waken more: Its breakers were only as flocks of lambs Bleating and gambolling along the shore, Where of late the storm-lion insane Had shaken abroad his tumultuous mane, Frightening the land with his rage and his roar. Round the headland to a little bay They led the shallop and drew it to land, Till at the golden beach it lay With its keel on the smooth wet sand. How haughtily the gilded prow Lifted its yawning, dragon head! And backwardâshaping the graceful bowâ The dragon's flying wings were spread; Where its curious name, In letters of flame, Burned in ciphers of golden red: Lo! there she stood, as fresh and stanch And bright as at her birthday launch. III. Out of the great commercial town, Summoned by the barque's renown, Came the masters and merchants down, And crowded the beach; While with gesture and speech, With eyes of wide wonder and looks of delight, They declared such a sight In the waters of Christendom never was known. The very dragon seemed to feel A tremor of pleasure that thrilled to the keel; And like a lady fair and proud, Flattered by praises breathed too loud, The shallop withdrewâso it seemed to the crowdâ And somewhat stiffly its acknowledgment bowed. But perchance it was only the swell Of the waters that under her rose and fell. And there were builders, with rule and line, Measuring its breadth and length, Gathering its secret of grace and strength; While, sitting on the sand, With accurate and dexterous hand, An artist secured the fair design. Singing a scrap of maniac song, Agatha pressed through the wondering throng, Bedecked in garlands of strange device, As if for a heathen sacrifice: She scattered blossoms from her hand Around the keel where it pressed the sand, Until it seemed to be wading through A flowery foam of various hue, And, singing still, began to deck The dragon's curved and haughty neck, Slipping over the glittering head A garland of yellow, and blue, and red; And then withdrew a space, to admire The beautiful collar of floral fire. When the fisherman saw his child, And heard her voice so strange and wild, Over his visage scarred and tanned The trouble spread. Then he knelt on the sand, And, hiding his face in his sunburnt hand, He sobbed aloud, while the tears of pain Through his fingers trickled plain, And dropt on the thirsty ground like rain. Along the beach his forsaken net Lay weltering in the briny wet, Where the scaly things in their despair Were struggling in their tangled snare, Flashing their silvery sides in air. Around the shore in the sunshine bright, Like webs of those invisible looms Whose noiseless shuttles are plied at night Among the briers and garden blooms, Innumerable nets were spread On stake and fence, and over the head Of many a low marsh-willow, to dryâ The delight, until now, of the fisherman's eye: For each, he thought, ere the season was o'er, With a miraculous draught would come to shore, And thereby enable him proudly to pay His daughter's dower on her wedding-day. But, alas! the wary Fates had cast Their unseen net in the river of Life; And all his hopes, the best and last, Were dragged to land with a fruitless strife, To pine on the sand without relief, And die on the sunless shores of grief. IV. Down from the height, With steps as light As a party for a bridal bedight, The lady and the monk were seen Gliding through the pathway green, While, with uneasy tread And drooping head, With one arm at the lady's zone, And one on the friar's shoulder thrown, Pale Roland walked between. They seemed, to a gazer far away, Like a happy group in the fields of May. Out of the little belfry near, A bell with accents loud and clear Poured its pious peal abroad, To turn the thoughts of men to God. Far and wide through the valley round Sailed the silver wings of sound,â Like a flock of doves rung out, Wheeling joyfully about, Flashing from their pinions white A sense of quiet and delight. The lady, as before a shrine Suddenly called to thoughts divine, Dropt upon her knees straightway, With hanging head that seemed to pray. And as one who stumbles with a curse and a groan, The monk fell in the pathway prone, And lay, like a statue overthrown; Muttering harshly to the air Something that passed for a hurried prayer. And when the bell was done, he rose Red in the face as a furnace glowsâ And cried, âNow, hang that sacristan! What pious crank has got into the man, Thus to be ringing a vesper tune In the very middle of afternoon? It takes one down so unawares That one can scarcely remember his prayers! And, besides, we have an old tradition, Which may be merely superstition, That when one kneels and forgets his prayer, The Devil is also kneeling there!â The crowd gave way as the party neared: And much they marvelled at the friar's beard, Hanging so long with crispy flow, Like a winter hemlock's barb of snow. But when with wondering eyes they saw The lady, they held their breath with awe, Transfixed and speechless with the sense Of beauty's rare magnificence. All bared their brows as she passed between, Bowing like subjects to a queen. The monk straightway regained his mood, And blessed the courteous multitude; For he thought such deference alone could be Paid to his age and piety. When the lady beheld the maid In her tawdry veil of flowers arrayed, She pressed her with a warm embrace; And, smoothing the wild locks from her face, Printed a kiss upon her brow, Which brought to her forehead the crimson glow, As if smitten by the sudden blow Of a fiery hand! Then said, in accents gay, âCome, my sweet friend, come away,â You must go with us to-day. Under the shadowy sail we'll sit, While our fairy barque shall flit Like a swallow that stoops to lave Its burnished bosom in the wave, Just tipping with its airy breast The enamored billow's eager crest!â Straightway, without more remark, The jubilant party gained the barque. Then the monk came to the bow, And, overleaning the dragon prow, A moment anxiously scanned the crowd, And cried in a voice of mirth aloud, âWho is there here so loves the sea That he will bear us company? One who knows the billowy realm, To trim the sail and to set the helm? Who will man our little ship For a three-hours' pleasure-trip?â Up stepped the fisherman; but ere His feet had touched the slanting plank, He staggered back, and shuddering sank, Like one who swoons with sudden fear! Then, shouldering his way till he gained the sand, A withered sailor, wrinkled and tanned, Holding a piece of a helm in his hand, And twitching his waistband with swaggering air, Cried, âA vast there, my hearty! While I'm of your party, You'll scarcely be wanting these landhlubbers there! Oh, ho! I'll be bound That you thought I was drowned, Because I plunged overboard into the dark! But with this stout piece of helm, What sea could o'erwhelm A sailor who fears neither billow nor shark?â Who on a fragment of wreck Sits as safe as on deck, And brings it to shore like a well-guided barque?â The lady laughed with joy insane When she beheld the skipper again. With a bound and a leap, he cleared the side, And strode the deck with his former pride: Once more he leaned against the helm, Once more he was lord of the watery realm! V. The cable was loosedâthe barque was free, And like a white sea-bird, it flew to the sea. Of all the shapes that swim Through the ether blue and dim, Or over the swinging ocean skim, With their lifted plumes for sails Set before the summer galesâ Or on enchanted lakes the swan,â Or the swift wind-footed fawn, None might with that fairy barque compare, Less in the water than in the air, As she sped from shore through a track of foam. With the sudden joy and speed Of the carrier-bird when its wings are freed And it darts from its alien tower for home! Flying away with its white sail full, It doubled the headland like a gull, That, careening suddenly, seems to dip In the flashing brine its white wing's tip. Then up and down the coast it boreâ In and out, as it would explore The hundred inlets of the shore! With all her garments fluttering wild, On the deck the fisherman's child Stood by the lady, who proudly sat On a little throneâwhere an Indian mat Mantled the floor, like a flowery moss Where Mab and her fairies gambol and toss, And covered with figures of strange device, And scented with odors of orient spice, Which rose like an incense heavy and sweet When the lady stirred her delicate feet. The maiden stood robbing her own bright hair To garland the lady's locks less fair: The scarlet wreath seemed a brighter red As it gilded the braids of that darker head,â And the poisonous berries livelier shone, Like crimson embers newly blown. It seemed a chaplet fit for Fame To bind on the brazen brow of Shame, The guerdon of deeds which have no name!â Like Evening wreathed with sunset flame, The lady sat; and in her eyes, Like shadows which the day defies, Nursed by the darkness, there seemed to rise Thoughts which on the black wings fly Of sin-engendered mystery! Still humming a scrap of maniac tune, The maiden stood, like frenzied May, At the close of her last sweet day Casting all her blossoms away Into the burning lap of June! Stripping herself of every flower, She shed them all, a fiery shower, Over the lady, till she was as bright As a statue decked with lamps at night,â Those little lamps of various hue, Scarlet, purple, green, and blue, Which in myriads star the dark In a royal festive park. Many a venomous brier and burr Among the rest she gave to her:â There were slips of hemlock, tips of fir, Mingled with leaves of juniper; Monkshood flower and mandragore, Henbane rank and hellebore, And nightshade breathing deadly malice; And there was the foxglove's purple chalice Full of bane; but which, 'tis said, Hath power to thrill and move the dead. And there, like goblets brimming red Stolen from a demon's palace, Shone the poppies, flaming bright; And those which had a withered look At the lady's touch fresh vigor took, As if it did their lives renew With a taste of their own noxious dew; Even as stars that wilt in the light Revive again in the lap of Night,â Thus each, like Mars, refreshed with fire, Flamed where they lay; while high and higher, Heaving with a strange desire, The lady's breast 'gan swell; and she Kissed the maid with unwonted glee,â The maid who, without a blossom left, Looked scarce less lovely thus bereft,â While the other shone as gorgeous and gay As if she were decked for a queen of May In a fiery tropic far away! VI. Low at her feet pale Roland sat, Gazing up in her radiant face; And said, âIn such a time and place How sweet were song, did thy voice but grace The air with melody!â Whereat The crownÃ©d lady smiled, and sent Her glance to a little instrument Which a crimson cord made fast Up at the side of the polished mast; And without further sign or command, Roland placed it in her hand. It was a curious instrument, A kind of Persian mandolin, Found perchance in an Arab's tent, With every manner of gem besprent, And wrought with all the tracery Which Eastern art is cunning in: The body was ribbed like a shell of the sea, Yet black and burnished as ebony; The graceful neck was long and thin, Where the cords ran up to golden keys; And it looked as it had only been Waked to mysterious melodies, On phantom lakes and enchanted seas, Flashing to fingers weird and wan, In the minstrel ages lost and gone. Waiting to hear the wakened lute, The very air and the sea hung mute; And the maiden, breathless with listening desire, Crouched silently down at the side of the friar. The lady's fingers, like swift wings, Over the flashing cordage stirred, Till music, like an answering bird, Suddenly leaped from out the strings. Round and round the cadence flew, Sailing aloft and dropping low, Now soaring with the wild sea-mew, Flushing its breast in the sunset glow, Then slowly dropping down the air, Wailing with a wild despair. Down and down, Till it seemed to drown, With wide pinions on the brine, Weltering with no living sign, Till the listener's pitying eye Wept that so fair a thing should die. Then with malicious laughter loud, Jeering the sighing hearer's grief, In a moment wild and brief, Filling the air with mockery, It leapt to the sky and pierced the cloud, Soaring and soaring, till it seemed to be Climbing to the airy throne Where the Thunder sits alone. Roland listened, confused, amazed, While an unknown frenzy thrilled his heart; And Agatha on the lady gazed With steadfast eyes and lips apart; And there sat the friar smoothing his beard, As into the maiden's eyes he peered With a sidelong sinister glance; While she, as one in a charmÃ©d trance, Bending forward, could only see Roland leaning on the lady's knee, With pale, bewildered countenance, Gazing up in her face, which beamed As if a torchlight on it gleamed; And flushed as with an orient wine, Where passion's swift and fitful flame On the breath of music went and came Like a gusty blaze on a heathen shrine. â'Tis a sight to make a graybeard feel,â Exclaimed the monk, âhis old heart reel, E'en though it beats in the breast of a friar! Old age is a rust which may conceal; But under it there is the tempered steel Holding its latent spark of fire. âSee how he looks in the lady's face, And how her dark eyes gloat on him! In each other's souls they gaze, and trace Thoughts which to us are vague and dim. âAh me! it recalls that hour divine, In a palace garden at day's decline, When a youth beneath a Sicilian vine Sat with a lady, and she was crowned With scarlet flowers and leaves embrowned, Even as they had been seared to death In the hot sirocco of passion's breath! Oh, how she played! The hours were drowned In goblets of music, and love, and wine! But, well-a-day!âfor that same sin The youth became a Capuchin!â VII. Every word of the garrulous monk Into the maiden's sad heart sunk, With a dreary plunge and spasm Sinking through the aching chasm, As desperate shapes of agony Leap from a burning ship at sea! And as she gazed on the lovers there, Every hope in her breast of despairâ Hopes which until now unknown Had thronged her heartâwith a sigh and a groan Dropt away through the dusky waves Low and lower to their briny graves, With downward face and wide-spread hair! Was it Loveâor was it Hateâ The hate of bitter Jealousyâ Or conscious of being desolateâ Or was it the combinÃ©d three That thrilled the maiden suddenly, Like variant winds that smite and wake The waters of a summer lake? âSee!â said the lady with a glance of glee, âHow the dear child looks at us! Why stares she so? Why breathes she thus? As if her heart were parching to dust In a roaring and raging furnace-gust! Ah, Roland, it is plain to see This is all for the love of thee! âOh, it is a pity and shame To see a young heart thus consumedâ Even though it burns self-doomed In an unrequited flame!â Thus speaking, the lady, with looks of pity, Woke the prelude of a strange wild ditty; Touching the lute with a gentler sweep, She poured from her bosom, full and deep, A burst of song that rose and fell With a heavy and heated and stifling swell. As fanned from a tropical garden in bloom By the sultry wings of a far simoom! âA princess dwelt beneath the sea, In a palace of coral and pearl;â Her liquid chambers wide and free Were lined with soft green tapestry, Where a thousand suitors bent the knee; But her lip wore a scornful curl. âThere day by day she seemed to pine, In her palace of coral and pearl;â Thronging the halls of the crystal brine, In vain they came in a flattering line, With the wealth of every Indian mine, King, Prince, and Duke, and Earl. âBut her heart was wandering far away From her palace of coral and pearl:â Seeking the realm of the upper day, Sighing as April sighs for May, Through her emerald roof she saw the ray, Like a flag at morn, unfurl. âFor she, like many a princess before, In her palace of coral and pearl, Had dreamed of one on a foreign shore, The only one her soul could adore, And thither her thoughts went more and more, Till her weary brain 'gan whirl! ââI pine.â she cried, âalone, alone!â In her palace of coral and pearl:â âI pine and perish where hope is none! Would I were sailing with the sun, Would that the home of my love were won, Though he spurned me like a churl! ââBut like a dull sea-weed I cling To this palace of coral and pearl!â Though round me the crystal alcoves ring With praises my siren subjects sing, Yet hopeless I pine as he were a king And I a peasant-girl!ââ She ceased; but ere the sound had passed, The skipper's voice, like a rattling blast Blown through empty spar and shroud, Announcing the tempest-bearing cloud, Took up the strain, while he pressed the helm, Still looking the lord of the watery realm; And, as he sung, the instrument Its wild accompanying cadence lent:â âA monarch reigned beneath the sea On the wreck of a myriad thrones,â The collected ruins of Tyranny, Shattered by the hand of Destiny, And scattered abroad with maniac glee, Like a gibbeted pirate's bones. âAlone, supreme, he reigned apart, On the throne of a myriad thrones,â Where sitting close to the world's red heart, Which pulsed swift heat through his ocean mart, He could hear each heavy throe and start, As she heaved her earthquake groans. âHe gazed through the shadowy deep which shields His throne of a myriad thrones,â And saw the many variant keels Driving over the watery fields, Some with thunderous and flashing wheels Linking the remotest zones. âOft, like an eagle that swoops in air, He saw from his throne of thrones, The wingÃ©d anchors with eager stare Leap midway down to the ocean's lairâ While hanging plummets gazed in despair At the unreached sands and stones! âAlong his realm lie mountainous bulks, The tribute to his throne of thrones,â The merchant's and the pirate's hulks,â And where the ghost of the slaver skulks, Counting his cargo,âthen swears and sulks Among the manacled bones! âHis navy numbers many a barque The pride of his throne of thrones:â Golden by day and fiery by dark, Each cleaves his pathway like a shark! But his favorite barge is a dragon-ark, The fairest ship he owns! âThe voice of that princess beneath the sea Reached to his throne of thrones;â Then he leaped in his barge right gallantlyâ And cried, âMy child, come sail with me, We will flash to sunward far and free, Till love for thy grief atones!ââ The skipper ceased. 'Twas but a lull In the gale of song! With bosom full As some gigantic organ-bellows, Worked by the hands of officious fellows, While the priest at the altar white Is slowly chanting a sacred rite, The monk burst forth with a gusty roar, That seemed to echo along the shore:â âAn abbot dwelt beneath the sea In a cloister of shell and weed;â Its walls of curious masonry Were built by the ocean peasantry, Those merman slaves, whose supple knee Loves best a mysterious creed. âAnd he was so virtuous, the story runs, In his cloister of shell and weedâ That the pious mermen, fathers and sons, Their daughters and sisters, the fairest ones, Brought to his charge, till a thousand nuns Chanted his mystical creed. âAnd he had control of a thousand friars, In his cloister of shell and weed;â He taught them to chasten all worldly desires, To smother with prayer all carnal fires;â Not to be drunkards, and not to be liars, Or gluttons of boundless greed! âAnd warned them,âbut this was a slander base.â In his cloister of shell and weed,â Not to be like that earthly race Who had brought the system into disgrace, Till the Devil himself grew red in the face At sins he had never decreed! âThis abbot heard, through the sedgy grate Of his cloister of shell and weed, The woful princess bewailing her fate, Then saw the approaching barge of stateâ And, closing his missal and locking his gate, He leaped aboard with speed. âA scion of Church and State was he, In his cloister of shell and weed,â And well he knew if a wedding should be, That he, as chief prelate under the sea, Must be there to perform the solemn decree, To sign and to seal the deed!â VIII. While the songs were sung, each passing breath Seemed breathed from the feverish breast of Death; All the air which had heard the tune Hung sultry and heavy and dead, Pulsed through and through with flushes of red, And hot as a broad, unshielded noon In a fiery clime at the end of June. In the purple sky, an hour too soon, Like a wedding-barque await At a Venetian palace gate, Floated the empty crescent moon, Moored at a crimson cloud,âa barge of state In the sunset's broad lagoon. But to Agatha that cloud Seemed like a world consuming with fireâ Whereon the avenging sun had breathed his ire! And the moon was only a poor corpse in a shroud Which had been shot from a barque forlorn Into the tranquil sea at morn, That rose at eve a ghastly sight, To blanch the mariner's cheek with fright! Incongruous fancies, a maniac crowd, Leaped through her brain, and shrieked aloud; While, as to a blighting gust Of red ashes and dust, With a desperate wail her sad soul bowed. And when with dry, hot eyes she sawâ Each throbbing like a burning heartâ The glowing lady lean and draw Roland close to her heaving side, And, smoothing his floating locks apart, With looks of mingled passion and pride, Press on his brow a heated kiss,â Her heart, as one in a nightmare dream, Striving with fruitless effort to scream, Seemed plunging down a black abyss. But when the lady, with sidelong eyes Half veiled in mocking hate's eclipse,â A look which pitied, yet seemed to despiseâ Glanced at the maiden's face of despair, And, bending down and down with triumphant air, Set the hot seal of her love on his lipsâ There was more than a frenzied soul could bear! A sudden shriekâwild, sharp, and shrill! A plunge!âa gurgle!âa widening thrill Rippling the water! And all was still! âOh, see!â cried the lady,ââO Roland, behold! She has leapt in the sea! She is drowned in the sea! And it is all for the love of thee! Her heart was so warm, and your blood was so cold!â âBy Heaven!â he cried, âit shall not be!â Then another plunge and another thrill Rippled the wave; and a voice as shrill As ever a fiend could shout in glee, Cried, âAdieu! adieu! Till we meet anew In our palace of splendor far under the sea!â And all the air, the moment after, Was filled with wild demoniac laughterâ And like swift hounds in pursuit of a wolf, Sudden flaws from the leash of the gale Leapt upon the straining sail, And chased it over the flashing gulf. Away and away, with a murderous flight, Sped the barque,âaway and away! Doubling the headland into the bay, Like a red-handed homicide flying from sight! IX. The toil, the danger and despair Struggling with hope in that brief moment there, May not be chronicled or said; Or how it seemed from ocean's shadowy bed That demon shapes leapt up, with murderous hands, Striving to pluck the desperate swimmer down, That with his burden he might sink and drown, And lie supine upon the charnel sands. But still he labored;âand a form divine, Such as an angel clothed in sunshine hath, Glimmered before him, walking on the brineâ Slow leading shoreward in a golden path. And well he knew 'twas that sweet pitying sprite Which he had driven into the howling night! But now her pale lips seemed to move Forgivingly with smiles of love,â Until his heart with hope beat high and warm, And a new impulse nerved his struggling arm. Anon his feet were on the slanting sands, Where slow he toiled with the increasing weight, Which, like a sea-weed stranded, desolate, Hung o'er his arm with dripping hair and hands. And now wild groups came down the sloping lands, Looming gigantic 'gainst the level sun, And their long shadows to the beach did run Precipitate with uncontrollÃ©d woeâ Outstripping those who followed! Till anon Around the melancholy show The people gathered, and with faces wan Told their great grief as only mourners can Who loved the thing they mourn from the hour its life began! Foremost her sire, a wild disconsolate man, Mingled with the wet grief of the sea The tears of his tempest agony, Which like baptismal waters ran Over her breathless breast, as from the hand Of the pale priestess Sorrow flung, Naming her one of that most enviable band Whom loving Death hath ta'en into his land While beautiful and youngâ Into the land of May, forever green, To be crowned with virgin flowers immortally a queen. With shreds of white hair sorrowing in the breeze, The village priest leant o'er her with a prayer; And then he said, âLet loving arms of care Take up this mournful victim of the seas, And bear her to the church, and on a bier Lay her before the sacred altar-shrine, Where the mild Saviour, with His eyes divine, Looks peace to grief, and hope to those who fear; And as He lifted Jairus' child from death, He may renew even here the life-reviving breath.â And as he bade they bore her; while behind Pale Roland followed with bewildered mind. X. When they had gained the little chapel door, And were about to cross the sacred sill, Their drownÃ©d burden breathless as before, The anxious crowd beheld, with sudden thrill, The serpent ring her dripping right hand bore Leap from her finger and as lightning pass, Flashing between their feet, Searing the ground with heat, A crooked flame that vanished in the grass. Then straightway to the maiden's cheek Flushed up a little dawn of life; And her waking pulses, weary and weak, In their recovery seemed to speak Of the long and maddening strife, Of the maniac dreams which had filled her brain, While her heart lay stunned in its night of pain. And when at the altar-shrine They laid her like a corpse supine, Scarce noting the life-announcing sign, Then Roland fell on his knees, and pressed Her cold white hands to his aching breast: And instantly the long-frozen pain Which had oppressed and benumbed his brain, Seemed to melt in a repentant glow, And in floods of tears to his eyelids flow, Till his sad heart felt like an arid plain That is drenched with a generous summer rain. Was it the sunset's parting beam Piercing the little window red? Or was it the lightning's vivid gleam Through the startled twilight shed? They only knew a crimson flush, Making the sacred shadows blush, Shot up the aisle, as if the fiery rays Of a meteor-ball had set the air ablaze: And then a baleful voice Drew their eyes to the door away: And all could plainly hear it say, âCome, Roland, come! Thou hast no choice: Thou shalt not, darest not stay: The prayer which thou must learn to pray At another altar must be made, And thy vows to another God be paid!â And, gazing through the door, they saw The lady and monk beyond the sill; And every breast was filled with awe, And every pulse ran chill. They stood like travellers in the night, Surrounded by a blazing light, Who see the eyes of the wolf and pard, Fixed with wild and eager desire, Insane with hunger, and only debarred By a living threshold of circling fire. Then Roland cried, âAvaunt! avaunt! Here at this holy altar I swear, By my future hopes and my past despair, To fly from the fiends and that lonely haunt, With pain, and woe, and demons rife! And if once this sweet maid come to life, To claim her my bride! And in token of this, I set on her lips this sealing kiss!â He spake and bowedâlips touched to lips; And as a taper, when the gusty dark Has blown its splendor into eclipse, While its wick still holds the crimson spark, Which, touching another taper's rays, Instantly stands in the air ablaze,â So life, in a swift contagious flame, Suddenly illumined the maiden's frame! A moment surveying the sacred place, Her blue eyes turned, then with modest grace Gazing up into Roland's face, Her sweet tongue said, in its first release, With words which seemed breathed from the lips of peaceâ âThe spell is past! Oh, hour divine! Thou, thou art mine! and I am thine!â And the listening shadows cool and gray, In the gallery, like a responding choir, Where the organ glowed like an altar-fire, Seemed to the echoing vault to say, Softly as at a nuptial shrineâ âThou art mine! and I am thine!â And still through the breathless moments after, Like doves beneath the sheltering rafter, Along the roof in faint decline, The echoes whispered with voices fineâ âMine and thine! mine and thine!â And now, like a golden trumpet, blown To make a glorious victory known, The organ, with its roll divine, Poured abroad from its thrilling tongue Words the sweetest ever sungâ âMine and thine! mine and thine!â And up in the tower the iron bell Suddenly felt the joyous spell, And flung its accents clear and gay, As if it were rung on a wedding-day; And like a singer swaying his head To mark the time Of some happy rhyme, Breathing his heart in every line, Thus swayed the bell, and swaying saidâ âMine and thine! mine and thine!â XI. The lady standing beyond the door, Like one whose despair can bear no more, Shrieked a fiendish shriek of wrath; And, with a hollow sepulchral sound, Her body fell upon the ground And lay a corpse along the path! And then a shadow, like a cloud On a hissing whirlwind fierce and loud, Swept seaward, pierced with curses and shrieks, Which like the lightning's fiery streaks Flashed madly through the twilight shades, Cleaving the air with sulphurous blades! Then the people ran to the headland height With the fascination of wonder and fright, And saw the little dragon barque Speeding out to the eastern dark, Away and away, as swift and bright As a red flamingo's sudden flight. And, climbing the black rocks high and higher, They gazed and gazed with aching sight, Till into the distant realm of night They saw it passâa ship on fire! Then Roland, who gazed on the body which lay In the path, a loathsome shape of clay, Defiled by a fiend and cast away, Called to the sturdy sacristan, Who came, a shuddering, awe-struck man, And bade him with his graveyard crew Bear and bury the thing from view. But when they strove, with fear and disgust, To raise that form which once had been The temple of Beauty and then of Sin, It fell from their hands a mass of dust,â Like a cavern of sand, so fragile and thin That a single touch will shatter it in;â Or like a long-consumÃ©d brand, Whose form in the ashes seems to stand, From whence the hungry flame has fled And left it a thing devoured and dead, Which the lightest touch of the lifting hand Shivers to nothing, a shapeless mass;â Thus the body fell, and lay on the grass A crumbled pile at their startled feet, As if it had been consumed by the heat Of that most subtle and fiery fiend Which so long it had fearfully harbored and screened! Days dawned and set, and year by year The bride became more fair and dear; And Roland saw with secret delight, As her face grew more refined and bright, How through every feature it seemed That the light of his long-lost Ida beamed! And by degrees her softening voice Like Ida's made his heart rejoice; Until, when the first few years had flown, He forgot that his early love had died, And, walking at his lady's side, He called her âIda,â and she replied To the name as it had been her own. Never more to that lonely height, Where only the wild birds of the sea Peopled the gusty balcony, He turned his feet; but lived and moved Among his fellowsârevered, beloved; And the world was no more a world of blight, But a realm of sunshine, warm and bright. With his brooding grief no longer blind, This simple truth his soul discerned,â And well it were for all mankind Had they the self-same lesson learned,â That it is not in the world abroad, In the sight of men and the light of God, That fierce temptations chiefly dwell; But in the misanthropic cell, Where the selfish passions are all enshrined And worshipped by one darksome mind. WAR POEMS. SHERIDAN'S RIDE. Up from the South at break of day, Bringing to Winchester fresh dismay, The affrighted air with a shudder bore, Like a herald in haste, to the chieftain's door, The terrible grumble, and rumble, and roar, Telling the battle was on once more, And Sheridan twenty miles away. And wider still those billows of war Thundered along the horizon's bar; And louder yet into Winchester rolled The roar of that red sea uncontrolled, Making the blood of the listener cold, As he thought of the stake in that fiery fray, And Sheridan twenty miles away. But there is a road from Winchester town, A good broad highway leading down; And there, through the flush of the morning light, A steed as black as the steeds of night Was seen to pass, as with eagle flight, As if he knew the terrible need; He stretched away with his utmost speed; Hills rose and fell; but his heart was gay, With Sheridan fifteen miles away. Still sprung from those swift hoofs, thundering South, The dust, like smoke from the cannon's mouth; Or the trail of a comet, sweeping faster and faster, Foreboding to traitors the doom of disaster. The heart of the steed, and the heart of the master, Were beating like prisoners assaulting their walls, Impatient to be where the battle-field calls; Every nerve of the charger was strained to full play, With Sheridan only ten miles away. Under his spurning feet the road Like an arrowy Alpine river flowed, And the landscape sped away behind Like an ocean flying before the wind, And the steed, like a barque fed with furnace ire, Swept on, with his wild eye full of fire. But lo! he is nearing his heart's desire; He is snuffing the smoke of the roaring fray, With Sheridan only five miles away. The first that the general saw were the groups Of stragglers, and then the retreating troops. What was done? what to do? a glance told him both; Then, striking his spurs, with a terrible oath, He dashed down the line, 'mid a storm of huzzas, And the wave of retreat checked its course there, because The sight of the master compelled it to pause. With foam and with dust, the black charger was gray; By the flash of his eye, and the red nostril's play, He seemed to the whole great army to say, âI have brought you Sheridan all the way From Winchester, down to save the day!â Hurrah! hurrah for Sheridan! Hurrah! hurrah for horse and man! And when their statues are placed on high, Under the dome of the Union sky, The American soldiers' Temple of Fame; There with the glorious general's name, Be it said, in letters both bold and bright, âHere is the steed that saved the day, By carrying Sheridan into the fight, From Winchester, twenty miles away!â THREE ERAS. INSCRIBED TO PRESIDENT LINCOLN. I. THE TREATY ELM. Some relics, consisting of a piece of Penn's âTreaty Elm,â of the old frigate âAlliance,â and the halliards of the sloop-of-war âCumberland,â wrought into appropriate form, were presented to President Lincoln by James E. Murdoch, Esq., and this poem was written to accompany them. Ere to the honored patriot's mansion yonder These charmed and emblematic relics pass, Upon the sacred fragments let me ponder, While Fancy, to the admiring eye of Wonder, Withdraws the veil, as in a magian's glass. I see the âTreaty Elm,â and hear the rustle Of autumn leaves, where come the dusky troops, In painted robes and plumes, to crowd and jostle,â A savage scene, save that the peace-apostle Stands central, and controls the untamed groups. These are the boughs the forest eagle lit on, Long ere he perched upon our nation's banner; Beneath their shade I see the gentle Briton, And hear the contract, binding, though unwritten, And worded in the plain old scriptural manner. Across the Delaware the sound comes faintly, And fainter still across the tide of Time, Though history yet repeats the language quaintly That fell from lips of Penn, the calm and saintly, Speaking of love, the only true sublime. This is his mission, and his sole vocation; To hear of this, the savage round him presses; How sweetly falls the beautiful oration Which bids them hear the marvellous revelation Of Christian peace through all their wildernesses! Not to defraud them of their broad possessions He comes, or to control their eagle pinions, But to pledge friendship and its sweet relations, Truth and forbearance, gentleness and patience, To all the people of their wild dominions. âWe meet,â he said, âupon the open highway Of broad good will, and honest faith and duty; Let love fraternal brighten every byway, And peace inviolate be thy way as my way, Till all the forest blossoms with new beauty.â So spake their friend, and they revered his teaching; They said, âWe will be true to thee and thine.â And through long seasons toward their future reaching No act was shown their plighted faith impeachingâ Marring the compact, loving and divine. O thou, like noble Penn, who truth adorest, A priest at her great shrine in Freedom's temple, While o'er this gift in thoughtful mood thou porest, Point to the faithful children of the forest, And bid the nations learn from their example. II. THE ALLIANCE. Here is an oaken relic from a barque, That speaks of olden scenes and ocean mystery,â An anchor from the Revolution ark, Dropt to the present through the twilight dark, Linking the troubled periods of our history. It may be that the sapling of this wood, Crowned on the coast with vines inviting inland, Was swaying to the sea-wind's fitful mood, Learning the rocking motion of the flood, When roving Norsemen stood agaze at Vinland. Or, did it feel the westward-sweeping galeâ The wind that still of God and freedom hymnethâ Which landward drove the saintly hero's sail, Until the sea-tossed pilgrims, worn and pale, Were landed on the icy rock of Plymouth? Where'er it grew, the woodman found the oak, It knew the teamster and the hewer's trestle, It felt the hammers, snuffed the pitchy smoke, Then seaward, like a steed from stall, it broke, While Salisbury hailed her favorite warrior vessel. Those were the days wherein we flung defiance Unto a tyrant monarch and his henchmen. We asked for friendship, France gave her compliance; And, hence, we called our vessel the Alliance, In honor of the noble-hearted Frenchmen. Then France was generous France: her well-earned fame Shed round the world a lustre of pure glory. No Italy breathed curses on her name, No Mexico stood pointing at her shame With feeble fingers, desperate and gory. The royal vessel sought her future realm,â Royal, because her parent oak was regal; And sceptred Science shaped her prow and helm, And crownÃ©d Courage, naught could overwhelm, Breathed in the bosom of that fierce sea-eagle. The ocean cormorants fled before her path; Her wing, descried afar, was fearful omen; Full oft her desolating vengeance hath, In the great tempest of her iron wrath, Sent a wild shudder through the hearts of foemen. Hers was the enviable pride to bear The unselfish hero's well-beloved exemplar, A Paladin, whose heart was full of prayer For freedom's Palestineâhis soul was there. Forever honored be the good knight-templar. O Gratitude, forget not the ovations Due to a noble country's nobler scion. Let Lafayette, before the gaze of nations, Stand canonized amidst our constellations, Belted with starry fame, like brave Orion. Old Europe's waters bore her graceful keel, And heard the rolling of her threatening thunder; She taught the insolent buccaneer to kneel And sue for quarter,âtaught their homes to feel A mingled sense of due respect and wonder. Though she awhile the doubtful Landais bore, It was her glorious privilege to carry The pennant of Paul Jones, the commodore, The pride and terror of the sea and shore. And his, the hardy and intrepid Barry. And when the war was o'er, she laid aside The latest vestige of the past commotion, And to the winds of Commerce, far and wide, Shook out her sails for other realms untried, And brought home treasure from the farthest ocean. There have been doubtful Landais' on our deck,â The deck of State,âthat wellnigh brought disaster; But thou, obedient to a nation's beck, Didst save the flag-ship of the world from wreck, O noble patriot and unswerving master! And still thou rul'st this stormy deck of State, With all thy sea-worn councillors in communion; Still, with thy manned and well-tried guns in wait, Stand by thy charge, O Captain, calm and great, Beneath the steadfast banner of the Union! And when the Southern buccaneer at last Shall strike her colors, saying, âIt is over,â Lash on the prize and raise her jury-mast, Stop all her leaks, make all her rigging fast, And bring her homeward, a repentant rover. And when anon our battle-flag is furled, If that no insolent gauntlet lies before us, By dastard in the hour of danger hurled, Then let our ship of commerce sweep the world, Her deck made musical with Freedom's chorus. III. THE PIECE OF HALLIARD FROM THE FLAG OF THE CUMBERLAND. This simple cord, by unknown fingers spun, Holds history in every slender fibre,â Telling more baseness in one action done, And of more heroism, than the sun E'er saw upon the storied tide of Tiber. A shred from off the halliards of our hope, Our battle-banner, seldom lowered or baffled! Did he who twined the fellow to that rope Behold, in his imaginary scope, The trembling traitor on his well-earned scaffold? He should have seen, methinks, the dance of death, The traitor's dance in this rebellious season, While the gaunt wizards on the Southern heath, Like the foul hags encountered by Macbeth, With hell-born charm and chant are brewing treason. Fierce maledictions, breathed with desperate might By trodden nations, longing to be freemen, Shall fall upon them with the withering blight Of leprous pestilence that walks at night, Till their own hearts shall curse their reigning demon. THE ATTACK. In Hampton Roads, the airs of March were bland, Peace on the deck, and in the fortress sleeping, Till, in the lookout of the Cumberland, The sailor, with his well-poised glass in hand, Descried the iron island downward creeping. A sudden wonder seized on land and bay, And tumult, with her train, was there to follow; For still the stranger kept its seaward way, Looking a great leviathan blowing spray, Seeking with steady course his ocean wallow. And still it came, and largened on the sight; A floating monster; ugly and gigantic; In shape, a wave, with long and shelving height, As if a mighty billow, heaved at night, Should turn to iron in the mid-Atlantic. Then ship and fortress gazed with anxious stare, Until the Cumberland's cannon, silence breaking, Thundered its guardian challenge, âWho comes there?â But, like a rock-flung echo in the air, The shot rebounded, no impression making. Then roared a broadside; though directed well, On, like a nightmare, moved the shape defiant; The tempest of our pounding shot and shell, Crumbled to harmless nothing, thickly fell From off the sounding armor of the giant! Unchecked, still onward through the storm it broke, With beak directed at the vessel's centre, Then through the constant cloud of sulphurous smoke Drove, till it struck the warrior's wall of oak, Making a gateway for the waves to enter. Struck, and to note the mischief done, withdrew, And then, with all a murderer's impatience, Rushed on again, crushing her ribs anew, Cleaving the noble hull wellnigh in two, And on it sped its fiery imprecations. Swift through the vessel swept the drowning swell, With splash, and rush, and guilty rise appalling; While sinking cannon rung their own loud knell. Then cried the traitor, from his sulphurous cell, âDo you surrender?â Oh, those words were galling. How spake our captain to his comrades then? It was a shout from out a soul of splendor, Echoed from lofty maintop, and again Between-decks, from the lips of dying men, âSink! sink, boys, sink! but never say surrender!â Down went the ship! Down, down; but never down Her sacred flag to insolent dictator. Weep for the patriot heroes, doomed to drown; Pledge to the sunken Cumberland's renown. She sank, thank God! unsoiled by foot of traitor! THE APOSTROPHE. Great ruler, these are simple gifts to bring thee,â Thee,âdoubly great, the land's embodied will; And simpler still the song I fain would sing thee: In higher towers let greater poets ring thee Heroic chimes on Fame's immortal hill. A decade of the years its flight has taken, Since I beheld, and pictured with my pen, How yet the land on ruin's brink might waken To find her temples rudely seized and shaken By traitorous demons in the forms of men. And I foresaw thy coming,âeven pointed The region where the day would find its man To reconstruct what treason had disjointed. I saw thy brow by Honesty anointed, While Wisdom taught thee all her noblest plan. Thy natal stars by angels' hands suspended, A holy trine, where Faith, and Hope, and Loveâ By these celestial guides art thou attended, Shedding perpetual lustre, calm and splendid, Around thy path wherever thou dost move. No earthly lore of any art or science Can fill the places of these heavenly three: Faith gives thy soul serene and fixed reliance; Hope to the darkest trial bids defiance; Love tempers all with her sublime decree. 'Tis fitting, then, these relics full of story, Telling ancestral tales of land and sea,â Each fragment a sublime memento mori Of heroes mantled in immortal glory,â Should be consigned, great patriot, unto thee. THE DEFENDERS. Our flag on the land, and our flag on the ocean, An angel of Peace wheresoever it goes; Nobly sustained by Columbia's devotion, The angel of Death it shall be to our foes. True to its native sky, Still shall our eagle fly, Casting his sentinel glances afar, Though bearing the olive-branch, Still in his talons stanch Grasping the bolts of the thunders of War! Hark to the sound! there's a foe on our border, A foe striding on to the gulf of his doom; Freemen are rising and marching in order, Leaving the plough and the anvil and loom; Rust dims the harvest sheen Of scythe and of sickle keen; The axe sleeps in peace by the tree it would mar; Veteran and youth are out, Swelling the battle-shout, Grasping the bolts of the thunders of War! Our brave mountain eagles swoop from their eyrie; Our lithe panthers leap from forest and plain; Out of the West flash the flames of the prairie; Out of the East roll the waves of the main. Down from their Northern shores, Swift as Niagara pours, They march, and their tread wakes the earth with its jar, Under the stripes and stars, Each with the soul of Mars, Grasping the bolts of the thunders of War! Spite of the sword, or assassin's stiletto, While throbs a heart in the breast of the brave, The oak of the North, or the Southern palmetto, Shall shelter no foe except in the grave. While the Gulf billow breaks, Echoing our Northern lakes, And ocean replies unto ocean afar, Yield we no inch of land, While there's a patriot hand Grasping the bolts of the thunders of War! Rome, July 4, 1861. THE OATH. Hamlet.âSwear on my sword. Ghost (below).âSwear!â Shakespeare. Ye freemen, how long will ye stifle The vengeance that justice inspires? With treason how long will ye trifle, And shame the proud name of your sires? Out, out with the sword and the rifle, In defence of your homes and your fires. The flag of the old Revolution, Swear firmly to serve and uphold, That no treasonous breath of pollution Shall tarnish one star on its fold, Swear! And, hark, the deep voices replying From graves where your fathers are lying: âSwear, oh, swear!â In this moment, who hesitates, barters The rights which his forefathers won, He forfeits all claim to the charters Transmitted from sire to son. Kneel, at the graves of our martyrs, And swear on your sword and your gun; Lay up your great oath on an altar As huge and as strong as Stonehenge, And then, with sword, fire, and halter, Sweep down to the field of revenge. Swear! And, hark, the deep voices replying From graves where your fathers are lying: âSwear, oh, swear!â By the tombs of your sires and brothers, The host which the traitors have slain; By the tears of your sisters and mothers, In secret concealing their painâ The grief which the heroine smothers, Consuming the heart and the brain; By the sigh of the penniless widow; By the sob of her orphans' despair, Where they sit in their sorrowful shadow, Kneel, kneel, every freeman, and swear. Swear! And, hark, the deep voices replying From graves where your fathers are lying: âSwear, oh, swear!â On mounds, which are wet with the weeping, Where a nation has bowed to the sod, Where the noblest of martyrs are sleeping, Let the winds bear your vengeance abroad; And your firm oath be held in the keeping Of your patriot hearts and your God. Over Ellsworth, for whom the first tear rose, While to Baker and Lyon you look; By Winthrop, a star among heroes; By the blood of our murdered McCook, Swear! And, hark, the deep voices replying From graves where your fathers are lying: âSwear, oh, swear!â THE EAGLE AND VULTURE. In Cherbourg Roads the pirate lay One morn in June, like a beast at bay, Feeling secure in the neutral port, Under the guns of the Frenchman's fort; A thieving vulture; a coward thing; Sheltered beneath a despot's wing. But there outside, in the calm blue bay, Our ocean eagle, the Kearsarge, lay; Lay at her ease on the Sunday morn, Holding the Corsair ship in scorn; With captain and crew in the might of their right, Willing to pray, but more eager to fight. Four bells are struck, and this thing of night, Like a panther, crouching with fierce affright, Must leap from his cover, and, come what may, Must fight for his life, or steal away! So, out of the port, with his braggart air, With flaunting flags, sailed the proud Corsair. The Cherbourg cliffs were all alive With lookers-on, like a swarming hive; While, compelled to do what he dared not shirk, The pirate went to his desperate work; And Europe's tyrants looked on in glee, As they thought of our Kearsarge sunk in the sea. But our little barque smiled back at them A smile of contempt, with that Union gem, The American banner, far-floating and free, Proclaiming her champions were out on the seaâ Were out on the sea, and abroad on the land, Determined to win under God's command. Down came the vulture; our eagle sat still, Waiting to strike with his iron-clad bill; Convinced by the glow of his glorious cause, He could crumple his foe in the grasp of his claws. âClear the decks,â then said Winslow, words measured and slow; âPoint the guns, and prepare for the terrible blow; And, whatever the fate to ourselves may be, We will sink in the ocean this pest of the sea.â The decks were all cleared, and the guns were all manned, Awaiting to meet this Atlantic brigand; When, lo! roared a broadside; the ship of the thief Was torn, and wept blood in that moment of grief. Another! another! another! And still The broadsides went in with a hearty good will, Till the pirate reeled wildly, as staggering and drunk, And down to his own native regions he sunk. Down, down, forty fathoms beneath the blue wave, And the hopes of old Europe lie in the same grave; While Freedom, more firm, stands upon her own sod, And for heroes like Winslow is shouting, âThank God!â THE FLAG OF THE CONSTELLATION. The stars of the morn On our banner borne, With the iris of heaven are blended; The hand of our sires First mingled those fires, And by us they shall be defended. Then hail the true Red, White, and Blue, The flag of the Constellation; It sails as it sailed, By our forefathers hailed, O'er battles that made us a nation. What hand so bold As to strike from its fold One star or one stripe of its bright'ning, For him be those stars Each a fiery Mars, And each stripe be as terrible lightning. Then hail the true Red, White, and Blue, The flag of the Constellation; It sails as it sailed, By our forefathers hailed, O'er battles that made us a nation. Its meteor form Shall ride the storm Till the fiercest of foes surrender; The storm gone by, It shall gild the sky, A rainbow of peace and of splendor. Then hail the true Red, White, and Blue, The flag of the Constellation; It sails as it sailed, By our forefathers hailed, O'er battles that made us a nation. Peace, peace to the world, Is our motto unfurled, Though we shun not the field that is gory: At home or abroad, Fearing none but our God, We will carve our own pathway to glory. Then hail the true Red, White, and Blue, The flag of the Constellation; It sails as it sailed, By our forefathers hailed, O'er battles that made us a nation. THE ROLL OF HONOR. DEDICATED TO MAJOR-GENERAL ROSECRANS, WHO INSTITUTED THE ORDER OF THAT NAME IN THE ARMY OF THE CUMBERLAND. Like the lordly Mississippi, we are sweeping to the South, A mighty Union river, and the Gulf shall be its mouth; O'er our front wave floats our banner, boys, that leads to glory's goal, And at its side, in martial pride, is borne the Honor Roll. On the Roll of Honor, boys; on the Roll of Honor, boys; Oh, let us see our names shall be on the Roll of Honor, boys. Like a great wind we drive Southward, with a storm of Northern hail, And our banner rides before us, as a cloud upon the gale; We will tear from out the rebel's hold his stolen stars and bars, And fame shall see our names enrolled beneath the stripes and stars. On the Roll of Honor, boys; on the Roll of Honor, boys; And fame shall see our names will be on the Roll of Honor, boys. With this great gale sweeping Southward, daily come the gentle airs Of our fathers' words of courage, and our mothers' constant prayers; With them our wives and sweethearts, with a love beyond control, Are reading in their fancy, boys, the names on Honor's roll. On the Roll of Honor, boys; on the Roll of Honor, boys; Oh, let them see our names will be on the Roll of Honor, boys. And when the last armed rebel falls, and bites his native dust; When waves o'er every mile of land the banner of our trust, We'll return to those whose images are shrined within the soul, And proudly listen while they read our names on Honor's roll. On the Roll of Honor, boys; on the Roll of Honor, boys; Oh, let them see our names will be on the Roll of Honor, boys. When the twilight settles round us in life's evening cool and gray, Among our children's children we'll describe the battle-day; They'll cluster to our knees to hear the story never old, And watch our trembling veteran hands point out the names enrolled On the Roll of Honor, boys; on the Roll of Honor, boys; And they shall see our names will be on the Roll of Honor, boys. And when at last Death's night comes on and stops the battle-din, And we have conquered in our hearts the rebel hosts of sin, To the fields of Peace above us, may we march there soul to soul, And find our names emblazoned on the great Celestial Roll. On that Roll of Honor, boys; on that Roll of Honor, boys; Oh, let us see our names will be on that Roll of Honor, boys. THE WAGONER OF THE ALLEGHANIES. A POEM OF THE DAYS OF SEVENTY-SIX. Look on your country, God's appointed stage, Where man's vast mind its boundless course shall run. For that it was your stormy coast He spread,â A fear in winter; girdled you about With granite hills, and made you firm and dread. Let him who fears before the foeman shout, Or gives one inch before a vein has bled, Turn on himself and let the traitor out. Boker. DEDICATION. TO JAMES L. CLAGHORN. Might I draw the inspiration Which the sky not oft awards, And so join the constellation Of the death-defying bards; Might I build some lofty moral, Reaching heavenward like a hill, On whose top should grow the laurel, Leaning towards me at its will;â I would gather all the honor Not to bind around my brow; But to you, a grateful donor, I would come, as I do now, And bring trophies, where the Ages Should behold our mingled names: But, alas! these simple pages Are the most my labor claims. Yet, should any leaves grow vernal In the summer breath of praise, Then for you, with hand fraternal, Let me twine my wreath of bays. Rome, August 1, 1861. INTRODUCTION. A guest was I at Berkley Hall,â And more behooves not guest to say: The very pictures on the wall With kindness seemed to whisper, âStay!ââ Old portraits of a dwindled line, From Lely's ruff and doublet down To Copley's matchless coat and gown, Or Stuart's later touch divine. Still from their frames of gold or oak, A knight or lady shepherdess, In valor or in loveliness, Leaned through the twilight air and spoke: They whispered that the road was dark, And lone the highway by the river, That past recall the latest barque Had swept the landing of the park,â There on the stream I still might mark Its fading path of ripples quiver, And hear the shore-wave running after, Like childhood with a voice of laughter. 'Twas evening, and the autumn fire Was feasting at the well-built pyre, Where every log, with glowing mirth, Poured from its breast of ample girth Some memory of April birth, To cheer the hearth-stone of October. There, conscious of his place and worth, One lordly hound, with visage sober, Sheathed his large eyes in sleep's eclipse, While visions of the woodland chase Disturbed the slumber on his face With twinklings at his ears and lips. That honored hearth was like a gate Wide with the welcome of old days; No sulphur-fuming, modern grate, Which black bitumen daily crams, But waved between its ample jambs Its flag of hospitable blaze. A century gone 'twas lined with tiles, Like those the hearths of Holland show; And still each Scripture picture smiles And brightens in the hickory glow. Oft from those painted sermons rude, In musing hours of solitude, A voiceless thought hath searched the heart Beyond the theologian's art. A moral winged with verse may reach A soul no weightier words will teach, As arrow from the archer's bow Has cleaved where falchion failed to go; And truths from out a picture oft, In colors as the iris soft, May shed an influence to remain Where argument would strive in vain. The chairs were quaint, antique, and tall, As in some old baronial hall; And in an alcove dusk and dim, Like Denmark's mailed and phantom king, A suit of armor tall and grim With upraised glaive seemed beckoning. And had it walked, the gazer, drawn, Must needs have followed on and on! The perforated steel confessed What death had pierced the wearer's breast. Near by, upon a throne upreared, A harp of bygone times appeared; The graceful form was deftly made, With pearl and precious woods inlaid; And in the firelight, as of old, It flushed the shadowy niche with gold. In all the orchestras which lift The soul with rapture caught from far, As in a bright triumphal car Round which celestial splendors shift, No instrument of earth affords An influence so divine and deep As when the flying fingers sweep The harp, with all its wondrous chords. Around its honored form there lives Romance mysterious, vague, and old; I see the shapes which history gives The bards in dim traditions told,â With visions of great kingly halls, Where red, barbaric splendor falls; But chiefly I behold and hearâ While bends a troop of seraphs nearâ The angels, with their locks of gold. Such shadowy halls of deep repose A New-World homestead seldom shows; But such the traveller frequent sees, Embowered within ancestral trees, In that maternal isle whose breast First warmed our eagle into life, And then, with rude, unnatural strife, Pushed the brave offspring from her nest,â Which, launched upon its sunward track, No voice on earth could summon back. Here, while I slowly paced the room, Strange visions filled the fitful gloom. On soft, invisible feet they came; I heard them speak,âor was't the flame That muttered in the chimney wide? Faint shadows wavered at my side, My spirit heard a spirit sigh, While gauzy garments rustled by! A pallid phantom of the fire Leapt o'er the high flame wildly higher,â A blaze that vanished with a bound! A whine escaped the sleeping hound,â A sudden wind swept up the lane, And drove the leaves like frighted herds; Some, like the ghosts of summer birds, Fluttered against the window-pane. Hawthorne, my friend, had I your wand, How, at the waving of my hand, The place, and all its grandeur gone, Should on the marvelling vision dawn! Each shepherdess, or warrior bold, Each knight and dame, in ruff and frill, Obedient to the wizard will, Should step from antique oak or gold; Bright eyes should glance, sweet voices sing, And light feet trip the waxen floor, And round the festive board should ring The friendly goblets, as of yore; And Love's sweet grief be newly told Under the elm-trees, as of old. But, ah! the hazel wand you wield Was grown by that enchanted stream Which sometimes flashes through my dream, But flows not through my barren field! The host came in: he took my hand: He saw the wonder on my face, And said, âAh, yes: I understand: You marvel at this curious place, Which starts your fancy into play. My locks, you see, are somewhat gray: What touches you on me is lost. This white hair drives romance away, As flowers are driven by the frost. But if a tale would please your ear, There's one which you are free to hear. âWithin a little, secret drawer Of this black, antique escritoire, I found a simple golden case, Which held the semblance of a face So wondrous in its wild attire Of floating robe and flying hair, And eyes that thrilled the very air To pleasure with their starry fire, That instantly the long-passed name Blazed on my memory like a flame; And old traditions, dimmed by years, Breathed from invisible lips there came, And lingered in my credulous ears, And night and day disturbed my soul, Until, perforce, I wrote the whole: That is the picture,âthis the scroll. Draw near; and let wild Autumn blow: He does but fan the lighted pyre: Between the warmth of wine and fire Perchance the verse may thaw and flow From off the visionary lyre As in the days of long ago.â PART I. I. BERKLEY'S BRIDE. My grandsire, when he built the place, Sir Hugh (you may behold him there, With ruffles, cue, and powdered hair, And proper blandness on his face) Was Tory, and his loyal soul No rebel dream could e'er beguile: He would have had the land in whole, Colossal, touching either pole, A likeness of his native isle! Hence the Elizabethan gables, The lawns, the elms, the antique stables, And all this lumber called virtÃ¹, This old time frowning down the new. But, ere I tell you more of him, Or point the objects strange and quaint, I pray you note these figures dim, Half hid in dust and cracking paint. That picture of those little ones, Which represent Alcmena's sons, Young Hercules and his weaker brother,â One with the snake in his baby hands, Crushing it as in iron bands, While in affright recoils the other,â Are portraits which the Berkley mother, In all the wealth of parental joys, Had painted of her two fair boys; And pictured thus, because she knew There was that difference 'twixt the two. The child who holds the writhing snake Was Ralph; the one who seems to quake And shudder back,âthat was Sir Hugh. They grew, and oft the quarrel loud Raged 'twixt them when they were together: Sir Hugh was sullen, wintry, proud, The other fierce as mad March weather,â A swift, cloud-blowing, whirling day, That o'er all obstacles makes way, Whether in wrath or whether in play, Striding on to the stormy end, Breaking what will not bow or bend. The soul which lights that face of paint, You well discern, would scorn restraint; And when he grew a stripling tall, Knowing himself the younger brother, And feeling the coldness of the other, The place for him proved far too small: So, staying not for leave to ask, Our Hercules went to seek his task; And, lest his family might reclaim The truant, took another name, Joining the army. Tradition tells He did some daring miracles. 'Twas said he fell in a midnight trench At Fort Du Quesne, against the French. Sir Hugh was then the only son To hand the name of Berkley on. His ladyâshe who bears a crook, And shepherds at her careful side A lamb, while from her eyes a look Of mildness chastens half her prideâ Gave to the house one child, and died. That child a maiden grown you see, With laughing eyes and tresses free, Which wellnigh mocked the painter's skill: It glows as if some morning beam Had poured here in a golden stream, And, when the sun passed, lingered still. A year or two went by, and then His heart was vacant as his hall. No pleasure answered to his call, No joy was in the world of men: One passion only swayed his mind, And thrust all other thoughts aside,â The passion of ancestral pride. The blindest of all eyes most blind Are those forever turned behind. Sheer to the past he held his face, Like some mad boatman on a river, With eyes still on some long-gone place, Until he feels the shock and shiver Which tells him he is gone forever. The empty hall, or vacant heart, When a new-comer passes in, Throwing the dusty doors apart, Sounds and re-echoes with a din Which makes the ghostly shadows start And fly into the dusk remote; The webs about the casements float And flutter on the sudden gust; The sun pours in its golden dust; The phantom Silence dies in air, And rapidly from hall to hall, With questioning eyes and backward hair, Wild Wonder speeds, and mounts the stair, Chasing the echoes' far footfall. Thus into Berkley's hall and heart, Led by his fancy's sudden whim, Passed a new bride,âa face to dart Strange lustre through the twilight dim,â A soul that even startled him, Until he half forgot his pride: Else had he never stooped to embower Beneath his ancient roof the flower To common wild-wood vines allied. Thus oft the passion most profound, Which triumphed over all the past, With unexpected halt, wheels round, And contradicts itself at last. He took her from a rival's breast. The hot youth dared him to the test: Alas! he fell on Berkley's steel; And, it is said, through woe or weal She ever loved the rival best. Her heart was like a crystal spring, Fluttered by every breezy wing: Was there a cloud? a darker shade Was in its deep recesses laid; Was there a sun? the pool, o'errun With glory, seemed to mock the sun. Her black hair, oft with violets twined (Her heart was with the wildest flowers), Tossed back at random, wooed the wind, That chased her through the forest bowers. The woodman felt his hand relax A moment on the lifted axe, As through the vistas of the trees He saw her glide, a spirit blithe; Or, when she tript the harvest leas, The singing mower stayed his scythe, Watched where she fled, then took his way, And, mowing, sang no more that day. With no misgiving thought or doubt, Her fond arms clasped his child about, In the full mantle of her love; For whoso loves the darling flowers Must love the bloom of human bowers,â The types of brightest things above. One dayâone happy summer dayâ She prest it to her tender breast: The sunshine of its head there lay As pillowed in its native rest,â A blissful picture of repose, A lily bosomed on a rose: The smallest lily of the vale Making the rose's sweet breast pale. One only day,âand then the sire, Still to his former spirit true, Lest the young bud should take the hue Of that which glowed too fondly by her,â Of that sweet wildling, nature's own,â And thereby learn the look and tone Of spirits alien unto pride, Conveyed her to the river's side.â For months his household felt eclipse,â And one of his own many ships Bore her across the ocean wide; And soon in her ancestral isle Was shed the sunshine of her smile. Ere half the summer passed away, The lady Berkley grew less gay, And, like a captured forest fawn, She seemed to mourn some freedom gone,â Mourned for her native mountain-wild, From which her feet had been beguiled. Her cheeks grew pale, and dim her eye, Her voice was low, her mirth was stayed; Upon her heart there seemed to lie The darkness of a nameless shade; She paced the house from room to room, Her form became a walking gloom. The menials, in their fancy wise, Glared at each other with strange leers; And, when she met her husband's eyes, Her sad soul burst to instant tears. He wondered with a cold surmise, And questioned with as heartless words: And could it be a woodland flower Would pine within such stately bower? Or, favored o'er all forest birds, Could this one droop with strange desires Within a cage of golden wires? Have you beheld the mountain brook Turned to some cultured garden-nook,â How it grows stagnant in the pool, Like some wild urchin in a school That saddens o'er a hateful book? Thus grew the lady, and her look Became at last as one insane; The cloud that long o'ercast her brain Still whirled with gusty falls of rain, Which drowned her heart and dimmed her eyes, As when the dull autumnal skies Long blur the dreary window-pane. One morn, strange wonder filled the place, And fruitless searching filled the day; The stream, the woodland, gave no trace: They only knew she passed away,â Passed like a vision in the air, With naught to tell of how or where. Tradition adds how, night by night, With hanging hair and robes of white, With pallid hands together prest In pain upon her aching breast, Her spirit walked from room to room, As if in search of something lost; That even Berkley shunned the gloom, Fearing to meet that breathless ghost; For some averred her form had been Afloat upon the river seen; While some, with stouter words, replied, The maniac lady wandered wide Upon her native mountain-side. II. THE WILD WAGONER. In days long gone, âThe Ship and Sheafâ Was deemed of goodly inns the chief:â âThe Ship,ââbecause its ample door Fronted the barques that lined the shore, Where oft the sun, o'er Delaware, Looking 'twixt masts and cordage bare, Their shadows threw on the sanded floor, Sailing a phantom vessel there. And there the crews from far-off climes Reeled in and sang their rough sea-rhymes, With laughter learned from the ocean gale, As clinked their dripping cups of ale; While froth was dashed o'er many a lip, Like foam against a speeding ship, And tables chronicled in scars The tankards and the thirsty tars. âThe Sheaf,ââbecause the wagoner there, The captain of the highway-ship, Fresh breathing of his mountain air, Hung on the wall his coat and whip; And farmer, bringing his stores to town, And drover, who drove his cattle down, Conversed of pastures and of sheaves, The season's drouth, or ruinous rain, Or told of fabulous crops of grain, Or fields where grazed incredible beeves. 'Twas April, and the evening winds Were rattling at the open blinds; The sign, upon its hinge of rust, Made dreary answer to the gust, That smote the masts like an ocean squall, And, whistling, mocked the boat-swain's call. The latch went up; the door was thrown A wide, as by a tempest blown; While, bold as an embodied storm, Strode in a dark and stalwart form, And all the lights in the sudden wind Flared as he slammed the door behind. The noisy revellers ceased their din, And into the corner skulked the cur, As the startled keeper welcomed in The feared and famous wagoner! Not long they brooked the keen eye-glance Who gazed into that countenance; And even in his mildest mood His voice was sudden, loud, and rude As is a swollen mountain-stream. He spoke as to a restive team. His team was of the wildest breed That ever tested wagoner's skill: Each was a fierce, unbroken steed, Curbed only by his giant will; And every hostler quaked with fear What time his loud bells wrangled near. On many a dangerous mountain-track, While oft the tempest burst its wrack, When lightning, like his mad whiplash, Whirled round the team its crooked flash, And horses reared in fiery fright, While near them burst the thunder-crash, Then heard the gale his voice of might. The peasant from his window gazed, And, staring through the darkened air, Saw, when the sudden lightning blazed, The fearful vision plunging there! And oft on many a wintry hill He dashed from out the vale below, And heaved his way through drifts of snow, While all his wheels, with voices shrill, Shrieked to the frosty air afar, As if December's tempest-car Obeyed the winter's maniac will. Ye knew him well, ye mountain-miles, Throughout your numerous dark defiles:â Where Juniata leaps away On feathery wings of foam and spray; Or queenly Susquehanna smiles, Proud in the grace of her thousand isles; Where Poet and Historian fling Their light o'er classic Wyoming; And you, ye green Lancastrian fields, Rich with the wealth which Ceres yields; And Chester's storied vales and hills, In depths of rural calm divine, Where reels the flashing Brandy-wine And dallies with its hundred mills. Such was the figure, strange and wild; And at his side a twelve-years childâ An eagle-eyed, bright, wondering lad, In rustic winter garments cladâ Entered, and held the wagoner's hand, While on his visage, flushed and tanned, A pleasure mingled with amaze Parted his lips and filled his gaze. His hair was wavy, long, and black, And from his forehead drifted back By the last greeting of the gale, Where still the random rain and hail Clung glistening like the tangled pearls In careless locks of Indian girls. The host with usual âwelcomeâ smiled, And praised the bright-eyed stranger child; Whereat the wagoner lightly spake:â âBe all your praising for his sake: I found him in the wagon-trough A-swinging like a cradled thing; With angry words I bade him off,â He stared with large eyes wondering, And answered that his way was long, His knees were tired, his feet were sore; And then his face new brightness wore, And straight his spirit burst to song: I listened, and my frown gave o'er. âMy nature, like my hand, is rough, My heart is of rude mountain stuff; And yet, I own, a laughing child Can make at times my temper mild. âI placed him on the wheel-horse back, Where shoulder shaken bells were ringing. The king of all the bells was he,â So silver-clear his voice of glee; And there he cheered the way with singing, Till music filled our dreary track. âThere is not much I ask or need; Yet would I give my favorite steed To sing the song he sang to-day, And for a heart as light and gay: The very team went rearing mad With joy beneath his voice so glad, As when the steeds of battle hear The wild war-clarion ringing near. Come, my young wood-bird, sing again That breezy song,âthat mountain strain.â And thus, from lips of fresh delight, The wild and artless song took flight. SONG. I. Where sweeps round the mountains The cloud on the gale, And streams from their fountains Leap into the vale,â Like frighted deer leap when The storm with his pack Rides over the steep in The wild torrent's track,â Even there my free home is; There watch I the flocks Wander white as the foam is On stair-ways of rocks. Secure in the gorge there In freedom we sing, And laugh at King George, where The Eagle is king. II. I mount the wild horse with No saddle or rein, And guide his swift course with A grasp on his mane; Through paths steep and narrow, And scorning the crag, I chase with my arrow The flight of the stag. Through snow-drifts engulfing, I follow the bear, And face the gaunt wolf when He snarls in his lair, And watch through the gorge there The red panther spring, And laugh at King George, where The Eagle is king. III. When April is sounding His horn o'er the hills, And brooklets are bounding In joy to the mills,â When warm August slumbers Among her green leaves, And Harvest encumbers Her garners with sheaves,â When the flail of November Is swinging with might, And the miller December Is mantled with white,â In field and in forge there The free-hearted sing, And laugh at King George, where The Eagle is king. Some praised the voice, and some, in doubt, With look uncertain, gazed about; And some, with loyal feeling strong, Condemned the singer and the song, And swore it was a rebel strain They would not calmly hear again. Whereat the wagoner's eyes of fire Flashed round a withering look of ire; His brows grew black, his temple-veins Grew large, like brooks with sudden rains; From face to face he bent his glance, And searched each quailing countenance. Thus for a time great Henry stood, When cries of âtreasonâ fired his blood, Till from his quivering lips was hurled The answer that awoke the world. And thus the last of all that band, Webster. The giants of our native land, The safeguards in our darkest hours, Our bulwarks and our sentinel towers, Oft stood, and from his cavernous eyes Sped to the heart his great replies: Far in advance he fiercely sent The fiery shaft of argument; And, when he spoke, 'twas but to tell In thunder where the red bolt fell! Thus stood the wagoner, till at length, With voice subdued to conscious strength, He spoke, and said, âOur eagle's wing Shall mount, the eagle shall be king! And jackals shall be heard no more When Freedom's monarch bird shall soar.â 'Twas passed, and none essayed reply: Defeat or triumph filled each eye. Whence came the boy? was asked in vain; What errand brought the truant down? What would he in the noisy town?â Conjecture but replied again. The wagoner drew the host aside, And said, âThe storm approaches near, And soon its bolts must be defied: For me its thunders bring no fear; But for this tender fledgling here, 'Twere well if he awhile might rest Secure in some protected nest. âThis hand that long has grasped the whip Must shortly take within its grip Another scourge, and boldly deal The blow a tyrant needs must feel: Hence it were best the boy should be Removed a little space from me, Lest that the battling oak might wrong The eaglet it has sheltered long.â Then said the landlord, as he took Another survey of the face, âIt was no fancy made me trace In that young form the Ringbolt look. Although your answer seemed to say He crossed but now your townward way.â âEven as I told,â the wagoner said, âThe urchin, wild of heart and head, Wishing to follow where I led, Stealthily stole behind the wain, Breasting the gusts of hail and rain. It was no easy task. I fear, For one so young to keep so near. For miles I thought I heard the beat And splash, behind, of following feet. You well may guess with what surprise I met the truant's laughing eyes. And how that face of brave delight, While in the trough he sat upright, Put all my chiding words to flight. âAll day my thoughts were somewhat sad With too much dwelling on the lad, Contriving where I best might trust His sheltered head when comes the gust. For when it comes, I must be where The thickest dangers are to dare; And there are cowards who would make The boy a victim for my sake. It was for this I would not own Before these Tories of the town The child was aught to me beside A friendless truant wandering down, Whom, pitying, I allowed to ride. âAnd now, my friend, I ask of you To aid me in my urgent need,â To give or find the boy a home Where present danger may not come: For this you shall receive your due, Even though it cost my last good steed.â The host replied, âLeave that to me: There's many a one comes here to dine Would joy beside his chair to see So lithe an urchin serve his wine.â âServe!ââbut between the wagoner's teeth The word was crushed to instant death: His brow grew black a moment, then As quickly it was cleared again. âBe it, good landlord, as you say,â He murmured: â'tis but for a day,â And then abruptly turned away. Under the gable-roof the boy Soon prest the soothing bed with joy: A little while he heard the sigh Of winds like spirits hovering nigh, The weather-vane that creaked aloof, The slumberous rain along the roof, And breathed the scent of bundled herbs Close to the waspy rafters hung; Then heard the hour from the belfry flung, And then the watch along the curbs, With voice that warns but not disturbs; Then slept, and dreamed of his native place, And woke with the red sun on his face. III. THE HEIRESS. Out of the sea, and over the land, Over the level Jersey sand, Making the bay with splendor quiver, Flashing a glory up the river, Came the morn on its wheel of fire, Flinging flame from its glowing tire. And with the morning, up the tide, Through golden vapor dim descried, A distant ship was seen to ride, Vague as a vessel in a dream,â More in the sky than on the stream. Down to the wharf a horseman rode, As oft on many a morn before; To note the barques that inland bore; And when his glance had swept the shore, His face with sudden pleasure glowed. He gave the rein to a boy near by, And raised him in his stirrups high, And poised the glass at his anxious eye.â Long time with breathless breast he gazed, Then deeply sighed, âNow, Heaven be praised!â And to a skipper sauntering past He cried, âUnless my vision fail, I know the set of yonder sail, And the streamer at her mast!â The skipper then a moment scanned The ship beneath his shading hand, And answered, with a sudden smile, âAy, ay, sir: I should know that deck: The same that saved us once from wreck,â âThe Lady of the Isleâ!â In haste the rider grasped the rein, And turned his restive steed again, Yet, ere he sped, with hand of joy A coin of silver flung the boy, And, as he threw, looked down and smiled; And then, as if some form had risen To meet him from its churchyard prison, He stared upon the wondering child. He would have spoke; but gayly now, Before the startled words could join, The boy was toying with the coin, Twirling it in the sunny air, Laughing to see it flashing there. A moment the rider pressed his brow, Then dashed the vision in scorn aside, And glanced again o'er the distant tide, And, with a face of new delight, Struck to the rowels the glittering spurs: The steed obeyed the urging burrs, And bore proud Berkley out of sight. The hour went by. Before the town The ship came up; the sails were doft; The happy crew, alow and aloft, Sang as the anchor rattled down,â Down and down, as the windlass flew, Linking the Old World with the New. A crowd was gathering on the wharf, A crowd leaned on the vessel's side, And here and there a waving scarf Bespoke some welcome friend descried. At the open gang a maiden stood, Reflected in the happy flood,â Oh, enviable flood, how blest With such a vision on thy breast!â Stood like a timid, startled fawn Gazing where its mates are gone; Stood like a white star in the dawn, Looking with inquiring eyes Where its westward pathway lies. Loud rumbling to the shore anon A stately coach came proudly drawn, With the ancient Berkley arms thereon; And soon to land the maid, whose hair Shed amber beauty in the air, Was borne, and on her father's breast The long-expected child was prest. The gold of fifteen summer suns Was tangled in young Esther's locks; Her voice, it was a rill that runs Half spray among the flowers and rocks; The hues of the dewiest violet Within her liquid eyes were set; Her form was small, her figure light As is some fabled fountain-sprite; The aÃ«rial scarf about her twined Like gossamer, seemed to woo the wind; A shape so light, she seemed to be That vision which poets only see,â The spirit of that iris small Poised on the mist of a waterfall. Foremost amid the crowd amazed The truant urchin stood and gazed. His sunbrown cheek and large dark eyes, His long black hair and rustic guise, Contrasted with the maiden bright, In her auroral beauty dight, As if some offspring of the eve His dusk home in the west should leave, To gaze, by love and wonder drawn, On some fair daughter of the dawn. Again the proud man, in his joy, Shuddered as he beheld the boy; But the happy maid looked round and smiled,â Smiled through her tears at the vision wild Of flashing eyes and raven hair, And cheeks long tanned by mountain-air. That smile went to the urchin's heart, Secure as ever archer's dart Sped to the target's central shade. Long quivering where it struck and stayed. But soon the carriage, with rumbling loud, Conveyed the lovely shape from sight; And he felt like a traveller in the night When the moon glides into a thunder-cloud And will no more return to sight. Out of the vessel came many a box Of Berkley's treasures manifold; Some with iron bands and locks, Some from the cabin, some from the hold. Some were carried, some were rolled; But one, with curious shape, to shore With careful hands the sailors bore: They said it contained a harp of gold Of strange device,âthey knew no more. A wain took up the various load; The truant followed it out of town, By wild, adventurous wonder drawn, Along the winding highway road, Where Berkley Hall looked proudly down Over its river-reaching lawn. When Berkley saw the boy again, He took him by the willing hand, And asked him questions simple, plain, In easy words to understand; But still the youth, with laughing eyes, Made answer with wide, vague replies; Nor would he tell from whence he came, But answered, âUgoâ was his name. And then the master smoothed his hair, And said, in soothing accents mild, âIt is a barren world, my child, And full of hearts as bleak and bare As is a winter heath forlorn, Where only thrives the tangled thorn; And when a stray lamb wanders there Its sides are sorely fleeced and torn. What can you to secure your bread? Or how at night procure your bed?â The boy looked up with wondering face, Which told such thought had never place Within the precincts of his brain; And then he gayly cried again, With voice on laughter's sudden wing, âSo please you, master, I can sing!â âA fair profession, by my troth!â Sir Hugh replied, âwhen tune and words Are fitted well, and, suiting both, The spirit with the voice accords: But they come off the hungriest birds Who, so enamored of their strain, Sing while the others, in the grain, With voiceless but industrious beaks, Feed well through all the harvest weeks. But pour me from your frolic heart A sample of your vocal art.â His simple tongue no urging stayed, And thus the call for song was paid. SONG. I. Where the peaks first greet the morn, Where the mighty streams are born,â Streams that sweep from east to west, Bearing great arks on their breast,â Where the eagle rears her young Barren rocks and pines among, There's a child which knows no fear, In the home of the mountaineer. II. Oft among the forests wild The lone woodman hears the child Singing with the earliest dawn, And his playmate is a fawn: When that fawn's broad antlers spring, They shall hear him louder sing; Then his startling song shall cheer Far and wide the mountaineer. III. Then his hero-hand shall take In its grasp a crested snake, And its front, so proudly crowned, Shall be humbled to the ground,â Humbled, trampled in the sand,â And no longer fright the land; Then the world shall thrill to hear Songs of that young mountaineer. The listener, half-way frowning, smiled, And said, âPerchance you are that child Far wandering from your mountains wild, And full of those obnoxious songs But fit for rebel ears and tongues?â âOh, no!â the laughing youth replied; âAlthough I come from the mountain-side, My songs I learned from a school-man gray, Who, when the children went to play, Oft called us round him in a ring, And, singing, taught us all to sing.â Then Berkley's brow relaxed his frown, And he looked still more kindly down; For there was something in that voice Which made him sigh and yet rejoice; And then he cried, âCome in! come in!â I care not what your kith or kin, Your face and singing please me well; And, if you will, here may you dwell, And be, till your maturer age, A gentle lady's faithful page.â IV. THE WELCOME. Days passed; and now from Berkley Hall, When evening sped her herald star, Gay music, with wild rise and fall, Streamed on the air; the windows all Shot their red beams of splendor far, Firing the dark like beacon-torches; While, like a wedding-train, there flowed Gay coaches up the winding road, Grating the gravel near the porches. Form after form, in rich attire Of gems and rustling garments bright, Swept like shadows out of the night Into the sudden blaze of light, Gleaming as in a robe of fire. The peasant on the distant slope, Agaze at joys beyond his hope, Believing the world was what it seemed,â Alas that others should be more wise!â Beheld them glide, as he fondly deemed, Into a transient paradise. Along the casements he saw them pass, As phantoms on the flaming glass; And when the music awoke the dance, Like shadows they seemed to sway and glance, Or revellers seen in a dreamer's trance. Fond soul, could some kind sprite have shown Some hearts beneath those robes and gems, The smile without, within the groan, He had not sighed that, poor, unknown, He stood apart in the open air, Or bartered his peace with the proudest there To wear the wealth of diadems. On the side of the neighboring height He saw the modest cottage light Gleam, like a glow-worm in the night, Through the foliage deep and dark: Strange contrast to the splendor bright Burning in midst of Berkley Park. And could the marvelling man have seen As clearly into that home serene As into that glittering hall of pride,â Have seen the pastor's patriarch hair Bending over the volume wide, And heard the old clock on the stair Saying its âAmenâ to the prayer, And, when the evening hymn was sung, Joining with its silver tongue,â He had not sighed o'er his station mean, While hearkening to that worldly din, Nor envied the tinsel triumph thin Of the stateliest hero of the scene. But hearts are human moths, alas! Fluttering against the glittering glass, Flying from Nature's flowery ways To worship and die at a transient blaze. Within, beneath the chandeliers, Wealth, envious of her two compeers, Beauty and Wit, her shoulders bare, Strode with her diamond front in air. There Beauty walked, too oft a shell, A bower of roses round a cell, A casket exquisitely bright, With not a jewel hid from sight; Like those proud piles by travellers found In foreign lands, with statues crowned, Covered with all that charms the eye, While within sits Poverty, Cowering in the ancestral dust, With scarce an ember or a crust. And Wit, with sparkling glance, was there, With flashing words of transient glare, Of satire or of flattery,â Thoughts that lorded or bowed the knee: They who lord it with haughtiest brow Have ever the supplest knees to bow. All these, Wealth, Beauty, Wit, bright three,â Graces they were by Heaven designed, But oftener grow, through vanity, The vices that ensnare the mind. But there was one in whom these three Were joined in sweetest unity,â To all the Virtues reconciled, But chiefly Charity's favorite child. So bright the spirit her form enshrined, So clearly the face displayed the mind, That the coldest gazer's heart 'gan melt, And, in after-days of memory, felt A kindlier impulse toward his kind: And it was all to welcome her The glittering groups collected were Through the crowd, on her father's arm,â How proud he was! how very proud!â She passed, like a ray of sunshine warm Cleaving its way through a broken cloud. First there was silence,âbreaths long drawn, As they would breathe her beauty in, And eyes full-orbed, as they would win New light from her enchanted dawn; And then the sudden whisper stirred, Like winds within the aspens heard. The proud man caught the applause around, That thrilled his depths of pride profound, Where it echoed, like a bugle wound Near caverns that prolong the sound. Then to her thronÃ©d harp he led, Where lustre of gold and pearl was shed, Like the light that flushed the air Around the maiden's pearl-looped hair. A moment her timorous fingers tried The chords that tremulously replied, Like reeds beside a little lake Warned by a breeze ere the winds awake: She toyed with the prelude; but not long The herald notes foreran the song. SONG. I. What though my feet have wandered far Through groves and lawns of antique shores, Where ever to the morning star The enamored lark her love-song pours, And through enchanted woods and vales Romance still walks, a spirit free, Thrilled by the poet-nightingales: I turn, dear native land, to thee. II. It is not that thy giant floods Sweep seaward with unrivalled flow; It is not that thy pathless woods Have majesty no others show; Not for thy matchless inland seas, Wider than eagle's eye discerns, Nor mountains vast;â'tis not for these My heart, dear land, to thee returns:â III. Not for thy seasons, though they sweep From unknown continents of ice, Or, waked in tropic forests deep, Bring summer from the land of spice; Not that thy fiery forest-trees, At harvest-close, with splendors burn In hues triumphant;ânot for these To thee, dear land, my steps return.â IV. Not only that my native hearth Is shrined among thy greenest hills, Or that my earliest infant mirth Was learned among thy flowers and rills, But, chiefly, that before thee opes A glorious future, grand and free, And thou hast all my brightest hopes,â For this, dear land, I turn to thee. To give the words by a maiden sung After they have passed her tongue, When more than half of all the grace Was in her voice and on her face, Is but to render a cup long drawn, With all its effervescence gone; 'Tis but to treasure in after-hours The garland of faded and dewless flowers That in the flood of the banquet-light Made the wearer's brow more bright. Had another dared the same to sing, They had denounced it a rebel thing; But from her lips could come no wrong: So they praised the singer and the song. 'Mid those who listened, too rapt to praise, Like blossoms that close in the sun's full blaze, Folding the ecstasy into the heart In silence, lest the smallest part Should exhale on the breath of joy exprest, Stood one, a chance-invited guest, Half hidden by a curtain's fold, Too modest and proud to be more bold, A youthâthe neighboring pastor's sonâ Whose mind and mien had already won The wide applause which oft exalts Till envy finds the virtues faults. A student he was, with cheeks grown pale, Long bleached in that scholastic vale Where mild-eyed Meditation camps Among her midnight books and lamps. But as he stood and heard her sing, And gazed with charmÃ©d lips apart, The joy long nestling in his heart Flew to his cheek on flaming wing. So feels the prisoner when his cell Flies open, as by a miracle; So glows he, breathing what freedom yields That first hour in the summer fields. Yes; love, and wonder, and delight, All three into his breast took flight; And those who knew young Edgar best Noted the change on his face confessed. Near by, with scarlet coat and plume, Like a bonfire in the room. An officer of the royal troops Blazed among the admiring groups. Who, when his eye approval glanced, Or when he spoke the applauding word, Deemed Berkley's honor was advanced; And, he, too, felt a new delight, And deigned from his great warrior height To stoop, and own his heart was stirred. Outside, in the stars' still light, Like a spirit of the night, Pressing close to the window-pane, With eyes of wonder and mirth insane, There looked a face which shunned the gaze, Coming and going, as a shadow plays When the wind, with rise and fall, Sways the elm-shade on the wall. This with a smile the maiden saw, Saw it come and then withdraw; And oft they knew not why she smiled, Nor saw the vision strange and wild Which she beheld with looks of joy,â The frolic-hearted truant boy. Thus oft beside a delirious child The watchers see upon its face Expressions which they cannot trace, And where its eyes so fondly turn They look, but nothing can discern, Still conscious of a presence near Of what they cannot see or hear. After the supper and the wine, Where flowed the Moselle and the Rhine, And Burgundy and prouder Spain, Disputing, held divided reign,â For Berkley deemed the worst of faults Poor brands, or scant-provided vaults,â Out they sallied into the air; And the great white moon was there. In merry groups about the green They strolled, and praised the night serene; Here the laugh and there the song Waked from sleep the feathery throng, Nested in the vernal realms Of the poplars and the elms. Their heads unsheathing from the wing, Some, which only the dark makes dumb, Wondered if the dawn had come,â The time to deck their plumes and sing. In the grove the whippoorwill Forgot his story, and sat still: But all who tell a tale of pain Know well the place to begin again. Music on a waveless stream Where the stars and moonshine gleam, While the light oar noiseless dips, And then, lifting, brightly drips, As if hung with pearl-strings rare, Caught from the water-spirits' hair; Then the music-freighted boat Seems some fairy ark afloat, Filled with groups of airy elves Playing to delight themselves, Blowing marvellous instruments, With a thrill of joy intense, Until the sounds that ring afar Seem blown from many a clarion star; Or as the thin rays of the moon, By some marvellous alchemy, Were changed from light to melody, One-half lustre, one-half tune; Or as the veil of the other world Were partly lifted, partly furled, And underneath the soft notes born In the eternal fields of morn Were wafted, on the wings of bliss, Out of that realm into this. Such were the sounds there heard to flow From off the winding stream below,â Till suddenly a clattering steed Dashed up the road in furious speed; But soon the checking rein was drawn. And now the rider gained the lawn. And into Berkley's ear apart He breathed a word that thrilled his heart; And then from group to group it passed, Quaking the breast from first to last: Something about a rebel troop, Like an eagle, soon to swoop; How some of that obnoxious clan, With horrid noise of horn and pan, âAmong the disaffected in Philadelphia, Dr. K? was pre-eminently ardent and rash. An extremely zealous loyalist, and impetuous in his temper, he had given much umbrage to the Whigs, and, if I am not mistaken, he had been detected in some hostile machinations: hence he was deemed a proper subject for the fashionable punishment of tarring, feathering, and carting. He was seized at his own door by a party of militia, and, in an attempt to resist them, received a wound in his hand from a bayonet. Being overpowered, he was placed in a cart provided for the purpose, and, amid a multitude of boys and idlers, paraded through the streets to the tune of the royal march. I happened to be at the Coffee-House when the concourse arrived there. They made a halt; when the doctor, foaming with rage and indignation, without his hat, his wig dishevelled and bloody from his wounded hand, stood up in the cart and called for a bowl of punch. It was quickly handed to him,âwhen so vehement was his thirst that he drained it of its contents before he took it from his lips. ... âIt must be admitted, however, that the conduct of the populace was marked by a lenity which peculiarly distinguished the cradle of our republicanism. Tar and feathers had been dispensed with, and, excepting the injury he had received in his hand, no sort of violence was offered by the mob to their victim.ââ Graydon's Memoirs of his Own Times. Had borne in mockery up and down, In a rough and jolting car, The noisiest Tory of the town, And only spared the plumes and tar Because they deemed the honor due To loyalists of deeper hue. And it was said, and well believed, And much the king's supporters grieved, That many a secret rebel band Was swiftly forming through the land; Nor could the wisest well divine The object of their full design, But knew it much behooved them each To be prepared or out of reach. Andâwho could tell?âbefore they knew, Some lawless and marauding crewâ None guessed their number or their powerâ Might choose in such a festive hour To burst into their midst and lay A tax which it were hard to pay. Scarce was the warning heard before There was swift mounting at Berkley door, And jostling hurry down roads of dust, As if they fled from a thunder-gust! They swept along the highway white, Like autumn leaves before the wind Which heralds the drowning storm behind, And round the far hill passed from sight. V. THE UNWELCOME. Proud Berkley, while his arm was placed Around his daughter's slender waist, As up the lawn they swiftly paced, Called loudly to his men in haste To make the outer gates secure, To bar and lock the stable door, Then loose the iron kennel-check From off the savage mastiff's neck. But scarce their feet had pressed the floor Beside the open entrance-door, When still he heard the revelling din Of some who drank and laughed within. Then cried the host, in gayer strain, âIt seems some lingering guests remain, To praise those old Burgundian casks Or compliment the Rhenish flasks. This suits me well. I'll bid them stay And revel till the break of day; For where such manly mirth is made No rebel band will dare invade.â He paced the hall like a generous host, And laughed to hear the loud uproar, Then cried, as he swung the festive door, âFill up, my friends, to a loyal toast! Fill high!ââbut, at the sight revealed, Some sudden paces backward reeled, Like a stunned warrior on the field, And stood a moment dumb and lost, Like one who meets a midnight ghost. Then stammered, âIf my sight be true, This is an honor scarcely due. To what may I ascribe, strange sirs, The presence of such visitors?â âTo what,â cried one, with the voice of a gale That laughs through an Alleghanian pine, âBut to drink your health in good red wine Till its hue returns to your cheek so pale?â And then the dozen sturdy men Laughed, and brimmed their cups again, And drained them to the hearty toast Of Berkley Manor and its host. 'Twas hard to see his dear old wines, The heart's blood of the noblest vines, Poured by a rough and sunburnt hand To nourish the souls of a rebel band. He heard the very wine's heart throb As it flowed from the flask with a sigh and a sob; The bubbles that wept around each rim Looked with imploring eyes at him. Then swelled that gusty voice once more, As the speaker rose full six feet four:â âThat loyal toast you left unsaid, To spare your breath, I propose instead; And let the craven, who dares, resist To drink the toast of a loyalist!â Sir Hugh a moment felt relieved: That word,âperchance he had been deceived; They surely could no rebels be Who proffered toasts to loyalty. A goblet into his hand was thrust, Brimming and dripping, and drink he must. âHere's to our royal governors, And every man who such prefers! May Heaven on their advancement smile In their speedy return to their native isle!â Before his sense the words explained, The lifted cup was wellnigh drained. Then burst the intruders' laughter-roar, While stood the host with bewildered brain. They rose and bowed, and said no more, And now behind them slammed the door; He heard them descend the river-lane With laugh and song, and all was o'er. They had come like a sudden burst of rain, And, like a gust, withdrew again,â Their voices dying beyond the lawn, Like rumbling clouds when the storm is gone. Then in chagrin he dashed the glass Down to the floor, a shattered mass, And glared thereon, till, laughing, came, Queen of the keys, the brave house-dame,â A woman tall and somewhat sere, But, like October, calm and clear; Her dark eye still retained its ray, Her hair its gloss, though touched with gray. She cried, âYou had strange guests to-night, And such not often you invite Did but the world know who were here, Yours would a rebel name appear.â To which Sir Hugh, with anger red, âMay a thousand plagues light on each head! I cannot guess what men they be: I only know they drank my wine:â Would they might hang, a scarecrow line, On the next lightning-blasted tree!â Hulda replied, âUnless I err, I heard a voice I have heard before: Each tone of his is a clinging burr, That from the memory will not stir.â Though it is full ten years, or more, Since last I heard his laughter-roar, Or his great stride along the floor, I would know, though twice as long it were, Ringbolt, the wilful wagoner.â Then, in silence and in gloom, The proud man passed to his private room, And paced the floor, in spirit vexed, With dusky fancies sore perplexed,â Thought of his daughter, thought of his pride, And of a hundred things beside. But soon o'er his soul of turbulence The quiet stole, and soothed the sense, As silence with its hand at last Smooths the pool where the storm has passed. But hark!âwas it the rising wind Swinging the boughs on the window-blind? Or chimney-swallows come anew, And talking in the sooty cavern, Conversing as room-mate travellers do Ere they go to sleep in a wayside tavern? Or was it some burglarious crew, With many a stealthy gouge and scratch, Working their way from screw to screw, Mining around the bolt and latch, With jar and screech, by sure degrees, Or torturing locks with skeleton keys? His heart beat loud: he spake no word, But seized two pistols and a sword; With cautious hand he oped the door,â It creaked as it never creaked before,â Then descended the stair; in his soul he vowed He never knew them to crack so loud. At every step he seemed to hear The noises more distinct and near; Now at the pistol-pans he tapped, And cocked the flints,âhow loud they snapped!â Then followed the sounds with breathless care, Here encountered a table, and there a chair, Till it seemed as if to retard his pace Each article had changed its place. The wave of every curtain's fold Now made his trembling heart less bold, Lest, issuing from the midnight air, His phantom bride should meet him there, With wild mysterious eyes to peer Into his shuddering soul of fear. But now he gained the parlor door The noise was louder than before,â A strange, mad music,âa grate,âa jar,â Like a maniac trying to tune a guitar. By inch and by inch, he opened the door, Saw long phantom windows stretch over the floor, Made by the moon, and in the full flood, Up at the end where the golden harp stood, Beheldâand his heart strangely thrilled at the sightâ The cause of the noises, the source of his fright. He gazed with anger mixed with joy, As he beheld the marvellous boy,â Anger at the fears unbounded, Joy that they had proved unfounded: One long relieving breath he drew, Then gazed with silent, steadfast view. Close to the harp the urchin prest And clasped it fondly to his breast, Then softly o'er his fingers stirred, To wake the tones he late had heard; Now stopped among the bass perplexed, Then tried the tinkling treble next; Now over all his wild hands sped, And then, despairing, he shook his head; His large eyes, wondering, seemed to say The music had gone with the maid away. Then he arose, with puzzled air, And gazed upon the pictures there, Marvelling much that such things were, All so alive, and yet no stir: And now he climbed into the niche Where stood the suit of armor rich, With golden tracery embossed, And gazed on it in wonder lost, From head to foot, with searching scan, Surveyed the marvellous iron man; Then, with a hand that nothing feared, The visor carefully upreared,â While Berkley saw, with a shudder of dread, The horrid yawn of that iron head,â Looked calmly in, and nothing saw, Then closed it, having felt no awe. Methinks to the angel of Peace 'twould be A charmed and sacred sight to see A child by an offcast coat of war, Who dreamed not what 'twas fashioned for. Heaven send the time when bloody Mars Shall only be known among the stars, And his armor, with its thousand scars, In a niche, as a curious thing, be bound, And peered into, and nothing found! Oh, would some sweet bird of the South This part of the poem was written six years ago [i.e., 1855]; consequently the passage was not suggested by the cannon which âDisunionâ has since then pointed against the North. Might build in every cannon's mouth, Till the only sound from its rusty throat Should be the wren's or the blue-bird's note, That doves might find a safe resort In the embrasures of every fort! Again to the harp the urchin passed, And sat him down, subdued and tame, And seeming overweighed at last, He leaned against the golden frame; His black hair drooped along the strings, Like a fainting night-bird's wings; A long sigh heaved his tired breast, And slumber soothed him into rest. There, like a spirit bright and good, The guardian moon above him stood: She kissed his cheeks, caressed his hair, And filled with happy dreams the air, Till the smile which o'er his features strayed The pleasure at his heart betrayed. Sir Hugh approached the sleeping child, And stood with wondering thoughts beguiled. How beautiful the picture there!â The gold harp propping the weary head, The flashing cords, the shadowy hair, And over all the moonshine shed! That slumbering face, it touched his heart, And bade the puzzled memories start; He had seen it in a dream before,â A dream long gone, to come no more. To keep the weary sleeper warm, He spread a mantle where he lay, And pressed it softly round his form, Then turned with noiseless feet away, And left him there to dream at large, The shadows' and the white moon's charge. VI. THE RISING. Out of the North the wild news came, Far flashing on its wings of flame, Swift as the boreal light which flies At midnight through the startled skies. And there was tumult in the air, The fife's shrill note, the drum's loud beat, And through the wide land everywhere The answering tread of hurrying feet, While the first oath of Freedom's gun Came on the blast from Lexington. And Concord, roused, no longer tame, Forgot her old baptismal name, Made bare her patriot arm of power, And swelled the discord of the hour. The strife was loud, the time was wild, When from the sky Heaven's favorite child, Sweet Liberty, in joy descended; A veil of lightning round her clung, Whereon the stars of morning hung, While o'er her head Jove's eagle swung, With all his thunderbolts attended. She came with Victory hand in hand, Whose flashing eyes and streaming hair And gleaming robes and flaming brand Shot splendor through the dusky air, And gladdened the awakening land. Wild was the night; but wilder still The day which saw those sisters bright, In all their beauty and their might, Hanging above the battle-stroke, Waving like banners through the smoke That veiled the heights of Bunker Hill. The field was wellnigh won, when, lo! From the enraged and reeling foe Another charge, another blow, That reached and smote the patriot chief. Pale Liberty recoiled a pace, And for a moment veiled her face; While Victory o'er her hero prest, And wildly wept on Warren's breast The first tears of her grief. Alas! that moment was her cost:â When she looked up, the field was lost. âLost? lost?â she cried. âIt shall not be, While Justice holds her throne on high! By Heaven! for every martyr dead, For every sacred drop here shed From out the brave hearts of the free, The foe shall doubly bleed and die!â Such was the voice that fiercely rung From brave New England's rocks and pines; Such were the notes that echo flung Far southward, from its clarion tongue, Through all the Alleghanian lines; And every homestead heard the call, And one great answer flamed through all. Each sacred hearth-stone, deep and wide, Through many a night glowed bright and full; The matron's great wheel at its side No more devoured the carded wool, And now the maiden's smaller wheel No longer felt the throbbing tread, But stood beside the idle reel Among its idle flax and thread. No more the jovial song went round, No more the ringing laugh was heard; But every voice had a solemn sound, And some stern purpose filled each word The yeoman and the yeoman's son, With knitted brows and sturdy dint, Renewed the polish of each gun, Re-oiled the lock, reset the flint; And oft the maid and matron there, While kneeling in the firelight glare, Long poured, with half-suspended breath, The lead into the moulds of death. The hands by Heaven made silken soft To soothe the brow of love or pain, Alas! are dulled and soiled too oft By some unhallowed earthly stain; But under the celestial bound No nobler picture can be found. Than woman, brave in word and deed, Thus serving in her nation's need: Her love is with her country now, Her hand is on its aching brow. THE BRAVE AT HOME. I. The maid who binds her warrior's sash With smile that well her pain dissembles, The while beneath her drooping lash One starry tear-drop hangs and trembles, Though Heaven alone records the tear, And Fame shall never know her story, Her heart has shed a drop as dear As e'er bedewed the field of glory! II. The wife who girds her husband's sword, 'Mid little ones who weep or wonder, And bravely speaks the cheering word, What though her heart be rent asunder, Doomed nightly in her dreams to hear The bolts of death around him rattle, Hath shed as sacred blood as e'er Was poured upon the field of battle! III. The mother who conceals her grief While to her breast her son she presses, Then breathes a few brave words and brief, Kissing the patriot brow she blesses, With no one but her secret God To know the pain that weighs upon her, Sheds holy blood as e'er the sod Received on Freedom's field of honor! Within its shade of elm and oak The church of Berkley Manor stood: There Sunday found the rural folk, And some esteemed of gentle blood. In vain their feet with loitering tread Passed 'mid the graves where rank is naught: All could not read the lesson taught In that republic of the dead. How sweet the hour of Sabbath talk, The vale with peace and sunshine full, Where all the happy people walk, Decked in their homespun flax and wool! Where youths' gay hats with blossoms bloom; And every maid, with simple art, Wears on her breast, like her own heart, A bud whose depths are all perfume; While every garment's gentle stir Is breathing rose and lavender. There, veiled in all the sweets that are Blown from the violet's purple bosom, The scent of lilacs from afar, Touched with the sweet shrub's spicy blossom, Walked Esther; and the rustic ranks Stood on each side like flowery banks, To let her pass,âa blooming aisle, Made brighter by her summer smile: On her father's arm she seemed to be The last green bough of that haughty tree. The pastor came; his snowy locks Hallowed his brow of thought and care; And, calmly as shepherds lead their flocks, He led into the house of prayer. Forgive the student Edgar there If his enchanted eyes would roam, And if his thoughts soared not beyond, And if his heart glowed warmly fond Beneath his hopes' terrestrial dome. To him the maiden seemed to stand, Veiled in the glory of the morn, At the bar of the heavenly bourn, A guide to the golden holy land. When came the service' low response, Hers seemed an angel's answering tongue; When with the singing choir she sung, O'er all the rest her sweet notes rung, As if a silver bell were swung 'Mid bells of iron and of bronze. At times, perchance,âoh, happy chance!â Their lifting eyes together met, Like violet to violet, Casting a dewy greeting glance. For once be Love, young Love, forgiven, That here, in a bewildered trance, He brought the blossoms of romance And waved them at the gates of heaven. The pastor rose: the prayer was strong; The psalm was warrior David's song; The text, a few short words of might,â âThe Lord of hosts shall arm the right!â He spoke of wrongs too long endured, Of sacred rights to be secured; Then from his patriot tongue of flame The startling words for Freedom came. The stirring sentences he spake Compelled the heart to glow or quake, And, rising on his theme's broad wing, And grasping in his nervous hand The imaginary battle-brand, In face of death he dared to fling Defiance to a tyrant king. Even as he spoke, his frame, renewed In eloquence of attitude, Rose, as it seemed, a shoulder higher; Then swept his kindling glance of fire From startled pew to breathless choir; When suddenly his mantle wide His hands impatient flung aside, And, lo! he met their wondering eyes Complete in all a warrior's guise. âIn concluding his farewell sermon, he said that, in the language of Holy Writ, âthere was a time for all things,âa time to preach, and a time to pray,âbut those times had passed away;â and then, in a voice that echoed like a trumpet-blast through the church, he said that âthere was a time to fight, and that time had now come.â Then, laying aside his sacerdotal gown, he stood before his flock in the full regimental dress of a Virginia colonel. He ordered the drums to be beaten at the church-door for recruits, and almost all his male audience capable of bearing arms joined his standard.ââ Lossing's Sketch of the Life of General Muhlenberg. A moment there was awful pause,â When Berkley cried, âCease, traitor! cease! God's temple is the house of peace!â The other shouted, âNay, not so, When God is with our righteous cause: His holiest places then are ours, His temples are our forts and towers That frown upon the tyrant foe: In this the dawn of Freedom's day There is a time to fight and pray!â And now before the open doorâ The warrior-priest had ordered soâ The enlisting trumpet's sudden soar Rang through the chapel, o'er and o'er, Its long reverberating blow, So loud and clear, it seemed the ear Of dusty death must wake and hear. And there the startling drum and fife Fired the living with fiercer life; While overhead, with wild increase, Forgetting its ancient toll of peace, The great bell swung as ne'er before: It seemed as it would never cease; And every word its ardor flung From off its jubilant iron tongue Was, âWar! War! War!â âWho daresââthis was the patriot's cry, As striding from the desk he cameâ âCome out with me, in Freedom's name, For her to live, for her to die?â A hundred hands flung up reply, A hundred voices answered, âI!â VII. THE WREATH. How sweet it is when day is new, And Summer is bathed in her young dew, To contemplate, 'twixt sun and sod, Each miracle that tells of God! Thus Edgar mused in dreamy mood, Next morn, on the upland solitude, As, slowly pacing, he gained the site Of the one great oak that crowned the height. He threw him on a mossy mound, His whole soul flooded with the sense Of that delightful recompense Which ever in the fields is found, Which lifts the heart when tempest-bowed, And sets the rainbow on the cloud. He saw the river where it flowed Under the morn, a golden road,â Saw ships upon that highway free Moving out to a boundless sea. He saw the mist-dispelling sun Mount, proudly conscious there was none Sceptred beside himself, to hold High state upon that throne of gold, And thought of Freedom's glorious light Conquering the dull mists of night. He saw the moon with anxious stare Walk down the cloudless western air, Seeking the stars with pale dismay, Like a shepherdess whose flocks From the fields have gone astray Among dusky woods and rocks, In the wilderness to roam, Till the eve shall bring them home. But he thought decaying Tyranny Might search for his lost flock in vain. Those stars now seeking to be free No gloomy eve should bring again. Long, long he gazed on Berkley Hall, And then on his native cottage small,â The one embowered in tall, proud trees, The one with its woodbine porch and bees; And never before they struck his sense With such a hopeless difference. He felt how often heart from heart Are kept by the mason's walls apart, Even though the doors were open, free, As Wealth can afford his doors to be. Gliding along the garden-walks, Gathering blossoms from the stalks, He saw the heiress of Berkley Hall, And fancied he heard the rise and fall Of the melody he knew must be Flooding her lips incessantly: For song was native to her tongue As to a runnel valeward flung, As wind to a cloud, as mist to a fall, As dew to the rose, and as sunshine to all. His full heart ached with love's sweet pain, Like a sealed fountain, charged with rain, That longs to sing in the summer air, Yet faints in its cavern of despair. From plot to bower, from vase to vase, Down to the very garden-base, He watched her gliding, fawnlike pace; The branches bowed to her forehead fair And shed their blooms on her golden hair. Oh, what is so like an embodied May As a frolic maiden, with laughter gay, Chasing her fancies as they flit Out of her heart of innocent wit, Shrining herself in the blowing bowers, Her tresses flecked with falling flowers? O Heaven, when I am old and bent And into the valley deathward sent, Be the last sweet vision which charms my way A breathing, bright, embodied May, That, while I lean upon my staff, I may see her smile and hear her laugh, That my heart may be fresh, till its life is null, With the sun and the dew of the beautiful! A tree blown bright with summer blooms, O'errun with honeysuckle-vines, A very fount of sweet perfumes, Stood in the garden, where the bees Toiled ever in these murmurous mines: And Edgar might have envied these; For some which mined that odorous store Brought back their sweets to his father's door. Around this tree a stair-way led Into the branches overhead, And there, 'mid spreading antler-boughs, A little room was fitted well, Where a votaress might make her vows Secure within her flowery cell. Such a one there stands to-day In a poet's garden far away, Where on many an afternoon, His great soul full of marvellous tune, Cloistered among flowers and leaves, He sings, and all the world receives. Lightly up the vine-like stair, Light of heart and light of foot, Flitted the maiden into the bower. Never in enchanted air Held a vine so fair a flower Or tree so sweet a fruit. She sat; the flickering sun and shade Like wingÃ©d sprites about her played: The wren peered in with curious eye, The bluebird carolled closely by, The robin from her nest above Looked, and resumed her task of love. The maiden's lap was full of flowers, Culled from the lavish garden-bowers. 'Mid these her fingers gayly played Entwining happy shade with shade, And, as she wrought the flowers among, Her sweet thoughts rippled into song. I. The blue-eyed lady of the morn, While she wreathes her flowers of light, Knows for whom those flowers are bright, By whom they shall be worn: She knows the golden locks of Day Shall bear that flashing wreath away. II. Though she knows their shape and hue May be crushed and tarnished soon, And the battle-heat of noon Waste their precious dew, Yet she knows when Day is through He shall wear his wreath anew. III. Would I knew some hero now! He should wear the wreath I make. Not for mine, but Freedom's sake, I would deck his brow: Should his arm victorious prove, He should wear the wreath of love. IV. Should he fall, I would outgrieve All who ever grief possessed; I would weep upon his breast, Overveiled like dewy eve, And above my hero dead Pour my tears till life had fled. The music on its golden wing Dropt from those dewy lips of spring: Scarce had the cadence ceased to flow, There was a sound of footsteps fleet, And suddenly, with cheeks aglow, Young Edgar knelt before her feet. She started with surpriseânot fearâ To find the stranger youth so near. He read the question in her eye, And, ere she spoke, he made reply:â âOh, lady, if I err, forgive: I know not, scarcely, if I live, Or that it is my soul is drawn By witching music, on and on, To kneel to thee in holier guise, While its poor dwelling yonder lies! I was as one within a land Where all he sees is dead and sere, Who droops with thirst, till near at hand He hears a fountain singing clear, Then, without further question, flies To find the spring which life supplies. In sooth, the music drew me near, And left me, lady, kneeling here. I heard the wish your song expressed, And echo answered in my breast. Oh, bid me wear that wreath you make, For thine as well as Freedom's sake!â The maiden's lips no word replied; But still the youth could well descry That there was pleasure in her eye And that her cheek was double-dyed. A moment, with extended hands, She held the precious wreath in air, Looked in his face her sweet commands, Then pressed it on her hero's hair, And would have fled with girlish bound, But suddenly a whirring sound Made her light foot recoil a pace, And drove the roses from her face. A wingÃ©d arrow fiercely near Had lightly grazed the stranger's ear, Dislodged one garland-bloom, and sunk Quivering in the gnarlÃ©d trunk, And firmly there the angry dart Transfixed the blossom's odorous heart. Her flashing eye the maiden turned: One hurried glance the truth discerned. Near by, upon the gravel path, Holding his attitude of wrath, The wild-eyed boy defiant stood. His black hair in a flashing flood Flung back, the quivering bow's advance, The right hand to the shoulder drawn, The knitted brow, the fiery glance Still following where the dart had gone,â He looked the great Apollo's child, Born in a forest dark and wild. A moment thus his posture kept The young soul burning in his face, Then suddenly, as in disgrace, He flung him on the grass and wept. Her heart was moved, her pity stirred: She fled to him as flies a bird Which hears its lonely fledgling call; She raised his head, smoothed back his hair, Looked in his eyes of wild despair. He smiled, and she forgave him all, Then led him calmly up the lawn, Glanced at the bower,âthe youth was gone. Young Edgar passed the garden-gate With dazzled brain and heart elate; The very landscape seemed to quiver, As if the burning pulse of love Was throbbing in the sky above, Thrilling the forest, field, and river. His spirit's wings had sudden birth; He felt beneath no heavy earth: He trod as on a field of air, And the flowers like stars shone everywhere. Down through the grove he gained the stream, Which flowed before him like a dream, Its ripples whispering to the shore, And love their burden evermore; Stream, flower, and tree, and breeze, and bird, Were eloquent with that one word. He knelt, with very joy o'erweighed, Beneath a flowering poplar's shade, And seized the coronal and kissed The blossoms (Love must have his will), And held them to his lips until His eyes were full of blissful mist, Through which the bright scene brighter shone In iris colors all his own. Then solemnly the flowers he prest Beneath the crossed hands on his breast, And cried, âIn face of Death and Heaven, This sacred wreath by thee was given, And it shall not dishonored be! Here, in face of Heaven and Death, I pledge my life, my latest breath, To Freedom and to thee!â âA valiant oath,âand nobly sworn!â Exclaimed a voice of thunder near; âAnd, if it be no idle boast, Go forth to-day, and take your post: For hark! 'tis Freedom's bugle-horn Which summons you from here! âMount yonder steed,âunless I err, He will not wait for whip or spur,â And I have one as good beside. 'Tis well: we both have far to ride.â The youth sprang up. The speaker's height Loomed o'er him like a cloud of night: The palm on Edgar's shoulder flung In friendship, wellnigh made him reel: The pledging right hand ached and stung, Grasped in the wagoner's grip of steel. âOur place of secret rendezvous,â He said, âis only known to few,â A cavern in a wild ravine, Hid by the friendly oak and vine, Where naught is heard but the Brandywine, Which rolls a shadowy flood between; A hidden place, that well might be The stronghold of a robber crew: Of such persuasion are not we, Save in our royal tyrant's view. âYour guide I cannot be to-day; My course lies far another way; But there is one will guide you true: Already, with a heart of joy, By yonder wall he waits for you, Henceforth your friend,âthe frolic boy. Mount you, and place the youth behind,â The wildest steed may carry double,â And in the holsters you will find Two trusty guards in case of trouble. âAnd when you meet the wild-eyed dame Who reigns within our secret place, If she looks strangely in your face, Speak kindly,âsimply name my name,â That my command has brought you hence; No further it behooves to know: 'Twere well you give her no offence: She may beâWell, no matter: go.â They parted, and the youth obeyed, And when the friendly evening laid Concealment over rock and wave, He gained the river and the cave. The cave referred to is not a creation of the fancy, but exists in the vicinity indicated, and is the scene of more than one romantic legend. PART II. I. THE YOUNG PATRIOT. Three years the flying sun and shade O'er Berkley Hall their change had cast, Since the wild urchin and the maid Within its loyal portal passed. Two years the invader's war-alarms Had waked the land, which still defied, And oft the gleam of patriot arms From Berkley's turret was descried. Upon his central roof a tower Rose and o'erlooked the country wide,â A place scarce fit for lady's bower; For there was seen, on every side, Many a cast-off coat of war, Helmet and sword, with hack and scar, With guns and pistols crosswise hung, O'er which the dust of years was flung. And there through many a changeful hour The anxious father and the maid Through telescopic glass surveyed The impending cloud of battle lower; They watched it move o'er land and stream, They saw the white sails come and go, And all the flashing splendor gleam Along the bristling plains below. There had they gazed through one long day, Watching an army glide away Beyond the city's western side,â So far, the line was scarce descried; But Esther knew a nation's trust Marched there in that long cloud of dust. âThank Heaven!â the loyalist exclaimed, âThey are gone!âour city is reclaimed, And England's banner now may fly, To gladden every loyal eye!â But now a voice, like a clarion clear, Rang laughing in the speaker's ear:â âI saw him! and your vaunt is vain: I saw him and his warrior train: Had you beheld that hero host, Your fears had not allowed the boast.â Who dared in Berkley's presence proud Speak rebel words so fierce and loud? Sir Hugh his hand in anger laid Upon the handle of his blade; But when he saw the wild-eyed boy, And gazed upon his face of joy, The vengeance in his breast was stayed. Then, with a tremor on his tongue, While something paler grew his cheek, As some retarding memory clung On the rebuke he fain would speak, He said, âRash boy, beware! beware! You put my kindness to the proof. Is it for this my three years' care Has sheltered you beneath my roof? Is it for thisââ He said no more: He saw the tear, the brow of pain,â A look which he had seen before, And one he would not see again. âNay, Ugo, nay!â the maiden cried, Her two hands clasping his between; Her tender eyes to his replied, And straightway all his troubled mien Grew bright, as when the iris form Glows on the cloud that threatened storm. âNay, Ugo, nay: speak out, and say The things which you have seen today.â âHim have I seen,â the boy exclaimed, âYes, him!âwhat needs he to be named? The world has only one broad sun, And Freedom's world but Washington.â Even while he spake that fiery word, The stripling's stature seemed to grow; All his young hero spirit stirred Sent to his cheek the warrior glow: Save the same look, which knew no awe, Learned on his native mountains wild, You scarcely longer saw the child Which thrice a twelvemonth past you saw. âHim have I seen!âoh, sight to cheer The patriot when he bleeding lies, To kindle hope and scatter fear, And light new fire in dying eyes! âHis way with banners waved and burned; The welkin rang with patriot cheers; From every window fondly yearned Bright eyes that spoke their joy in tears. âAnd music round his pathway flung Its gladness in a silver shower, And over all the great bells swung, Shouting their joy from every tower. âThe snow-white war-horse he bestrode Stept conscious, with a soul of flame, As if he knew his master rode Straight to the glorious gates of Fame. âThe coldest gazer's heart grew warm, And felt no more its indecision; For every soul which saw that form Grew larger to contain the vision. âI watched the long, long ranks go by, âWashington, in order to encourage its friends and dishearten its enemies, marched with the whole army through the city down Front and up Chestnut Streets. Great pains were taken to make the display as imposing as possible. To give them something of a uniform appearance, they had sprigs of green in their hats. Washington rode at the head of his troops, attended by his numerous staff, with the Marquis Lafayette by his side. The long column of the army, broken into divisions and brigades, the pioneers with their axes, the squadrons of horse, the extended trains of artillery, the tramp of steed, the bray of trumpet and spirit-stirring sound of drum and fife,âall had an imposing effect on a peaceful city unused to the sight of marshalled armies. The disaffected, who had been taught to believe the American forces much less than they were in reality, were astonished as they gazed on the lengthening procession of a host which to their unpractised eyes appeared innumerable; while the Whigs, gaining fresh hope and animation from the sight, cheered the patriot squadrons as they passed.ââ Irving's Life of Washington. And saw defiance in every eye; And every soldier true and stanch Wore in his cap a vernal branch, As Victory had placed it there For Fame to twine about his hair. âOh, how the wild heart sent its blood Through all the frame, a throbbing flood, To see those spirits, true and tried, Who crossed at night the roaring tide, What time the grinding gulfs of ice Made all the desperate peril thrice, When nothing but a patriot's fire Could breast the winter's bitter ire,â Who barefoot trod December's snow, And took the hirelings at a blow! âYou should have seen that stream of life Westward go and eastward come, Thrilled and cheered by the startling fife, Throbbed through and through by many a drum. âThere, on his charger fierce and tall, A fiery stallion black as night, His bold front overtopping all,â A very tower along the right,â With eye that death could not deter, His rifle o'er his shoulder flung, Two pistols in his holsters hung, Rode Ringbolt, the wild wagoner. âThey who have seen that mighty hand, And heard the swearing of his whip, May well conceive the giant grip That wielded the commanding brand. âThere, like a son by his warrior sire, And mounted on a steed as good, His eye aflame with patriot fire, His cheek aflush with patriot blood, Rode Edgar, and the leaves of green Set in his cap had a rose between; I knew not what the intent might be: Perchance 'twas there for memory. âAnd after these a hundred more, Obedient to the wagoner's word, As fierce a band as ever bore Through fire and flood the avenging sword. These were his âmountain eagles,ââthese, So often seen a flying cloud That sweeps the hills through forest-trees, Following their leader loud,â A cloud whose form Is a whirlwind storm, When on the flanks Of the foeman's ranks It breaks from upland covert near, And pours its sudden bolts of wrath, Then gains anew the secret path Ere it is said, âThe storm is here!â Pale wonder strikes the columns wide, And, ere the foe can count his slain, Thundering down the other side The swooping tempest strikes again. âBut yesterday I heard their tramp, And saw their chargers dashing down, Each wild mane like a banner blown: They swam the river, leapt the creek, And o'er the near hills gained the camp, Bearing the news from Chesapeake.â So spake the youth. The maid near by Sat gazing in his clear, dark eye, As if she saw in its depths, anew, The whole bright pageant passing through. But Berkley frowned his blackest frown, As that would put the rebel down, And cried, âWell, sir, and is this all? The picture you would have us view Is rare, and colored somewhat new: Methinks 'twere easier to recall That barefoot, tattered, hungry crew Quartered but now near Berkley Hall. The farmers' planted fields forlorn Will make a poor return of corn, And thievish birds wax fat, I fear, Since all the scarecrows volunteer!â And he laughed the bitter laugh of scorn, So grating to a patriot's ear. âYou know so well how a rebel feels Fresh from his sty of mire and straw, While dangling, tangling 'twixt his heels Is dragged the sword he dares not draw: Gird on this brand, and let us see The brave young rebel you would be!â So speaking, he took from its place of dust A blade whose scabbard was thick with rust:â âAnd this chapeau, for many a year Untouched among the cobwebs here,â The webs may serve you yet for lint; This ancient gun, With rust o'errun,â It matters not the loss of flint; A pistol or so to grace your side; This old flask, too:âbe naught denied To deck you in your warrior pride! Behold you now! By Heaven, you stand As fair a rebel as walks the land!â Again the bitter laugh was flung From off the old man's scornful tongue. The youth a moment glared in doubt, Reddening like one who stands at bay; But presently burst his laughter-shout, And, crying, âThen be it as you say!â Wildly sprang from the tower away. They heard him descend the echoing stair, And Berkley stood with wondering air, Listening with wide eyes and lips, Like a traveller on Vesuvius' top When his adventurous hand lets drop A stone into the yawning pit: From rock to rock he hears it flit, Till the noises die in a far eclipse. But, when the clattering sounds were past, Sir Hugh stood with the look aghast Of a sire who has held his favorite boy, In frolic, only to fright and annoy, Over a precipice wild and deep, When, with a sudden and desperate leap, The child is gone! and the father stands, Stunned and staring, with empty hands. II. RUST ON THE SWORD. O happy and secure retreat, Dear Valley, home of many friends! I envy even the hurried feet Which fancy through your quiet sends! There led of old the Cambrian swain His flock by flowery brook and rill, Flinging across the summer plain The song he learned on Snowdon's hill,â Perchance some fragmentary strain Of ancient Merlin's wizard skill. His language now no longer breathes Its strange, wild music through the scene, But here and there a name still wreathes His memory in perpetual green. Tredyffrin, Caln, and Nantmeal hold Traditions of those sires of old; While Uwchlan, in her inmost vale, May hear at eve some Cambrian tale. Though many a brave ancestral name Has, starlike, in the distance set, Still thou hast others dear to Fame, Forgetful Time shall not forget,â Bright memories which shall long remain Cherished by every patriot breast,â That of the calm-browed painter West, And his, the fiery-hearted Wayne; And in thy scientific bowers Are those which fear nor frost nor sun: There, written with immortal flowers, Are found such names as Darlington. Nor dost thou need my hand to fling The poet's offering on thy shrine:â Among thy vales sweet minstrels sing Like thine own flashing Brandywine. From Kennet, Taylor's soaring strain Rings like a silver bugle round, As if on that near battle-plain Some herald's clarion he had found. 'Twas midnight in the secret cave, Darkness and silence reigning, save The dreary muttering of the brands That flickered where a caldron hung; While dreaming near, with folded hands, A woman sat, no longer young:â No longer young,âor rather say Her first youth only passed away. Her hair, as by a wind thrown back, Was glossy still, and thick and black; Her brow was clear, save where the brain Had set its outward seal of pain. Her cheek was tanned, her eye was bright With something of unearthly light. A string of mingled bead and shell, Which seemed of woodland life to tell, Entwined her head, and round her waist A costly wampum belt was placed; While on her tawny neck and arm Hung amulet and bracelet charm. Her robes of mingled cloth and fur With beads and quills embroidered were: And thus in her wild forest dress She looked an Indian prophetess, With still a something in her face, And something in her slender mien, Beyond the finest savage grace That ever marked a chieftain's queen. There sat she gazing, dreamy-eyed, As if within the flame she spied Visions of scenes long past and gone, Or some strange pleasure yet to dawn But now her quick ear caught a sound,â A stealthy footfall drawing near: A light hare tripping o'er the ground Would wake her eye, but not her fear: Still through the leaves it came more clear,â Her hand was on the rifle laid, Her quick glance pierced the cavern's shade; But soon the well-known whisper came, Giving the watchword and her name: âHist, Nora!âhist! 'tis I!ââshe bade Young Ugo enter undismayed. A moment in his laughing eye She gazed, then scanned his strange attire: His figure brightened by the fire, His shadow looming darkly high, The sword, the gun, the pistols, hat,â With questioning look she stared thereat. âSay, Ugo, say, where was the theft? What loyalist have you bereft?â âNo theft,â the boy indignant cried, âBut gift of one who bade me don These rebel arms, and urged me on, Until, to please him, I complied; But who, or where, or when, or how, The question matters little now. Come, Nora,âyou were ever good,â I only ask a little food. And then your helping hand to-night To make this old sword somewhat bright; While on these pistols I renew The polish which is still their due, And from the gun remove the crust Of honorable dust and rust; For well I know the time is nearâ The scene, too, not o'er far from hereâ When every weapon we can wield Shall be most dear to Freedom's field.â She gave him food with generous hand, And then essayed to cleanse the brand; And, while she wrought the blade along, She cheered her toiling hand with song. SONG. I. Oh, sweet is the sound of the shuttle and loom When the lilies of peace fill the land with perfume! Then cheerily echoes the axe from the hill, While the bright waters sing on the wheel of the mill, And the anvil rings out like a bell through the day, And the wagoner's song cheers his team on the way, Till the bugles sound here, and the drums rattle there, And the banners of War stream afar on the air. II. Then wild is the hour, and fearful the day, When the shuttle is dropt for the sword and the fray, When the woodman is felling a foe at each stroke, And the miller is blackened with powder and smoke, When the smith wields the blade in his terrible grip, And the wagoner's rifle cracks true as his whip: The bugles sound here, and the drums rattle there, While the banners of War stream afar on the air. III. Our brave-hearted yeomen,âour lords of the soil,â They reap where they sow the reward of their toil; In the broad field of labor their harvest is blithe, Their favorite arms the plough, sickle, and scythe: The plough and the sickle, the scythe and the flail,â These, these are their weapons, with these they prevail, Till the bugles sound here, and the drums rattle there, And the banners of War stream afar on the air. IV. Then the plough-horse is mounted, and flies o'er the plain, The blade is flung by in the grass or the grain, And the hand that grew strong on the flail or the plough, And battled alone with the harvest till now, The rifle and sword can as steadily wield, Till the harvest of foemen is swept from the field; While the bugles sound here, and the drums rattle there, And the banners of War stream afar on the air. V. Be God on our side in the season of dread! Be His strength with the living, His peace with the dead; His love shield the widow and orphan, His care Soothe the parents whose sorrow shall whiten their hair; Be success with the right when the struggle is through, And the sword be returned to the ploughshare anew, And no bugle sound here, and no drum rattle there, While the banners of Peace stream afar on the air! Thus, singing strenuously, she toiled To cleanse the blade which Time had soiled. The dull stains clung unto the steel, As they were spots of murderous red Whose stubborn hue must needs reveal The crime when first that blood was shed. She knelt before the midnight flame, Which seemed to leap with pleasure new: She gazed,âa chill ran through her frame As if a spectre met her view: She saw the Berkley arms and name Slow struggling through the veil of rust, Then swooned, and sank into the dust. But Ugo's aid was instant there: He raised her head upon his knee, Called her by name, smoothed back her hair, Looked with a face of mute despair On hers of pallid agony. At length a breath came full and deep, And then, as one who walks in sleep And sees with large unwavering eyes Through veils of awful mysteries, She stared, and sighed, âO Heaven! 'tis done!â Where fought the two there stands but one:â Then passed her hand across her brow, And looked in the o'erbending face, Which still its pitying posture kept:â âO Ugo, do not leave me now!â She groaned. âIt is a dreary place!â Then bowed her head and wept. âGo, lay her on her couch apart!â The deep voice made the hearers start. She choked the tears back to her heart, And mounted like a wounded deer That hears its calling comrade near. âGood Nora, we have much to do,â Said Ringbolt, âyet no need of you. Our eagle troop will soon be here: They tether now their horses near. The boy our sentinel watch can keep, So to your couch awhile and sleep. âUnless the storm should pass, or pause, Which hangs in thunder o'er the land, Ere set of many suns, your hand May do good service in our cause. âAll night the well-piled fire must glow, All night the molten lead be poured, Our guns recleaned, resharped the sword, In honor of the approaching foe; And if it be, as beldams say, The devil feasts when tyrants fall, Let his infernal board straightway Be spread, with room enough for all!â III. A BURIAL. Round all the wide horizon's bar There lay no growing cloud to mar The brightness of the autumn day; And yet the soft air felt the jar Of thunder rolling from afar, All the chronicles agree in stating that the cannonading at the battle of Brandy-wine was distinctly heard at Philadelphia and its vicinity. And shuddered in its pale dismay. Berkley, with anxious eye and ear, Stood on the southern porch to hear, Disturbed with many a doubt and fear, As rolled the distant roaring in; Then to his tower he mounted high, And searched through all the cloudless sky: All, all was clear, while still came by The rumble of the constant din. Was direful war the sudden source? Was it for this the rebel force Had ta'en but now their southward course? The sound his fears too well define! It is, it is the cannon's mouth! Its awful answer from the south Bears tidings of the roaring ranks That crash upon the trembling banks, The crimson banks, of Brandywine. Pale Esther, in that gloomy tower, Strained her sad vision's fruitless power: On every sound she seemed to hear The shout and groan together swell; At every burst that came more clear, She deemed her hero Edgar fell,â Fell, and perchance had breathed his last Long ere the death-announcing blast, Speeding through miles of frighted air, His dying sigh to her could bear. Still hearkening, gazing far abroad, Some sign of triumph to discover, All day she poured her prayer to God To shield her country and her lover. And Berkley, listening to the fight, Remembered Trenton's direful night, And that it was the same fierce train Whose lengthy line he saw of late Pour from the city o'er the plain, Led by a leader bold and great, Who now upon that roaring field Might cause once more their flag to yield. His heart, misgiving, sank away, Shuddering through the doubtful day: And should the rebels win, what then?â The troops were bold and desperate men: And he remembered with affright The terrors of that startling night What time a rude and lawless crew (All such he deemed the patriot lines) Intruded on his midnight view And drank his dearest, noblest wines: His frame was agued through and through Lest that wild scene should come anew. âHo! gardener, hostler, coachman!âho! Each man whose hand can wield a spade! A place of safety must be made: Bring shovels, hoes, and picks, and show How you can ply the digging trade.â When Berkley's will was thus conveyed, Down came the gardener and his man, The hostler and the hostler's lad, The coachman and the footman ran, And each his delving orders had. âDig me a pit!â the master cried, âAnd let it be both deep and wide, As 'twere a grave that might contain A score or more of rebels slain. But they for whom this grave is made Belong unto a nobler grade, With better blood than ever ran In purple veins of outlaw clan. Their royal genealogic lines Come down the Old World's antique vines: Ho, butler! my good sacristan, Bear out our monarch king of wines, Old Port, in all his purple pride, With queenly Sherry at his side, Followed by all their loyal train, The brave, light-hearted German knights Whose birth was on the Rhenish heights, The well-beloved of Charlemagne, And all those maids whose bright eyes glance In memory of their native France. Here, give them to their parent mould Till peace has stilled this rebel strife; Then doubly bright and doubly bold Shall be their renovated life.â Sir Hugh, thus making mournful mirth, That poorly cloaked his trembling fear,â It may be with a secret tear,â Consigned his precious wines to earth: 'Twas midnight ere they smoothed away All traces where his treasures lay. 'Twas midnight, and a moon in heaven, And silence over stream and hill, Save where the lone bird's song was given, Or aspens, with a whispering thrill. Seemed sheltering some young wind benighted, Late from the battle-field affrighted. The moon which through the window gazed Saw Esther 'gainst her harp reclining, Her pale and prayerful face upraised, And each eye with a tear-drop shining. Her prophet-heart foreboding well The fate which to that field befell, Her fingers trembled on the string, And thus her prayerful song took wing. SONG. I. O God, o'er all this blooming earth Is it with thine approving eye That every flower of noble birth Must bow to poisonous weeds, or die? II. Through all our pastures must there run The bramble which no fruitage bears? Must every field which loves the sun Be arrogant with choking tares? III. Must every tree whose leaves divine Were made in Freedom's air to spread. Be clasped by the obnoxious vine Until its boughs are sapped and dead? IV. Wilt thou not send some mighty hand To sweep through these entangled walks, To root the proud weeds from the land And burn the rank and thorny stalks? A moment now she paused, and sighed, Her hand still on the quivering cords, As waiting the ensuing words, When, at the open casement wide, A voice in patriot tones replied:â âYes, God hath sent that arm of wrath: It sweeps the land with sword of fire: The poisonous weeds but strew his path To build Oppression's funeral pyre!â Sweet is the sound when pardon calls The prisoner from his dreary walls; And sweet the succoring voice must be Which hails a sinking ship at sea; And dear the water's light when first It greets the desert-pilgrim's thirst, Or from the friendly helmet drips To cool a fainting patriot's lips: But not more sweet or dear than when A fond heart hears and meets again The voice and the responding eye Of one, the dearest 'neath the sky, Whom picturing fancy saw but now With drooping head and bleeding brow, Or heard the last-drawn sigh of pain Which laid him with his comrades slain: Her arm was round her hero prest, Her head was on his happy breast. IV. THE FIGHT AT THE FORD. When passed the first wild burst of joy,â That bliss which harbors no alloy,â The maiden brushed aside the tear, And sighed, âOh, Edgar, is it true? And are you living, breathing here, Or is't a phantom cheats my view, And leads me up this happy brink To plunge me deeper when I sink? Art sure that from the dreadful fray You brought no bleeding wound away? Thank Heaven that fainting prayer can win Its way above the battle-din! But tell me what great deeds were done, How the red waves were backward tossed Until the glorious field was wonââ âAlas!â he answered, âit was lost! And we retreat,âso deems the foe; But soon his bleeding ranks shall know 'Tis but the arrow drawing back Upon the stubborn-bending bow, To deal a fiercer, deadlier blow When vengeance speeds it on its track. âBut how shall I describe the fray? How word the horrors of the day To suit a timid maiden's ear? In sooth, the scenes are yet too near: The roaring cannon and the strife, With all those whirling ranks of life, Sweep through my brain, a puzzled maze. Confused within a cloudy haze: It seems a wild and broken dream, With transitory glimpse and gleam Of grappling groups, of bayonets' quiver. Of flashing guns and sabre-stroke, Caught through the openings of the smoke Upon some visionary river. âWrapt in a friendly cloud of mist, At morn the wagoner led us out, And, following our bold leader's shout, We put the pickets oft to rout, Oft trampling down a scouting list, And oft upon the foeman's flanks We dealt the blow their startled ranks Scarce knew where to resist. âFor hours we sailed from rear to front, And down their side, from front to rear: Death and confusion paid the brunt Wherever we came near. Anon was heard the opening roar Which called us to the bristling shore; And now the fearful scene was won Where deadly gun replied to gun, And pistol answered pistol flash, And then the fiery, sudden dash Of hand to hand, and sword to sword, While in the stream, with plunge and splash, Though thrice our number on us poured, We dealt the thick foe crash for crash, And strove to hold the ford. âNow was the time you should have seen Bold Ringbolt with his towering mien; Have heard his voice, have seen his blow Which drove the heavy weapon home, Each stroke of which unhorsed a foe, And sent him reeling red below, 'Mid trampled waters crushed to foam. But, oh, it would have touched your pride Could you have seen at Ringbolt's side Our standard-bearer, young and bold, Fighting and grasping in his hold The banner whose unsullied fold The foeman's rage defied! âBut, sad to see, and sad to tell, Brave Ugo's horse beneath him fell, The banner-boy went down. A moment,âshall the horses' tread Deal death upon his struggling head? A moment,âshall he drown? No!âRingbolt from his saddle leaps, His mighty arm is round him cast, But still his fighting posture keeps, His blows fly strong and fast. âThe rider who survives must grieve That ere his brave steed strove to cleave With rearing hoof that skull apart, He fell an instant carcass slain, Hewed wellnigh through from throat to mane, Or gashed unto the heart. âNo arm with that great arm could cope, Whether or foot or fiery horse; But now, as with a tiger's force When battling to protect its young, Upon his steed again he sprung, While in his hold the boy still hung, And grasping, as with grip of death, The reins between his angry teeth, To give his right arm clearing scope, There still his blade of battle swung, And on the pressing foemen flung The blow that to the invaders rung The knell of many a hero's hope. âAt last the overwhelming tide Of foemen pressed us slowly back; We did not turn, we did not slack Our heavy blows, or ever flinch, But, slowly backing, inch by inch, We gained the other side. But now was heard the roaring din Of Wayne's artillery pouring in; And while its iron torrent flowed, Leaving the foe enough to do, Along the highway we withdrew, To breathe a little, and reload. âWhen Ugo wakened from his swoon, Gathering his scattered senses soon, He sought the banner of his pride; He looked through all the busy band, And stared upon his empty hand, Then cast his eagle glances wide. âOh, death! oh, infamy!â he cried: He saw it on the other side, Beneath the invader's standard tied, Heavily hanging, wet and tame, Weeping as 'twere in grief and shame. âThe hour was loud, but louder still Anon the rage of battle roared Its wild and murderous will; From Jefferis down to Wistar's ford, From Jones to Chads the cannon poured, While thundered Osborne Hill. Oh, ne'er before fled holy calm From out its sainted house of prayer So frighted through the trembling air As from that shrine of Birmingham! âOft through the opening cloud we scanned The shouting leaders, sword in hand, Directing the tumultuous scene; There galloped Maxwell, gallant Bland The poet-warrior, while between, Ringing o'er all his loud command, Dashed the intrepid Greene. âHere Sullivan in fury trooped, There Weedon like an eagle swooped, With Muhlenberg,âwhere they were grouped The invader dearly earned his gains,â And (where the mad should only be The fiercest champion of the free) The loudest trumpet-call was Wayne's; While in a gale of battle-glee, With rapid sword and pistol dealing The blows which set the foemen reeling, Sped âlight-horse Harry Lee.â And once or twice our eye descried, 'Mid clouds a moment blown aside, With lifted hand that well might wield The thunders of the storming field, The Jove of battle ride! And every eye new courage won Which gazed that hour on Washington. â'Twas now that, marvelling, we beheld Upon the rising summit near, By every danger unrepelled, Confused by smoke and dust,ânot fear,â A form with wild and floating dress, Which looked a battle-prophetess. But when the veiling cloud went by, We knew the face and flashing eye Of Nora, and we heard her cry Of warning in that hour of need:â ââSpeed, Ringbolt, to your leader speed! And bid him know the stealthy foe With double strength comes up behind: It was but now I saw him wind From out the valley road below.â âShe ceased: a short and sudden scream Escaped her breast; across the stream, Far piercing through the veil of haze, Her fierce eyes sent their staring gaze, And, following that stare, we saw, With soul of wonder and of awe, Where Porter and bold Porterfield Renewed the struggle at the ford; And at the moment when the sword Swayed in the balance where to yield, In middle of the mad mÃªlÃ©e Young Ugo snatch his flag away, Leap from the hot, opposing shore, The banner tied about his waist, And in the flood plunge fiercely o'er, By a hundred whistling bullets chased, And soon, with wild ecstatic hand, He waved it 'mid our shouting band. âNaught dearer fills a soldier's sight, Or swells his breast with more delight, Than when his flag, late scorned and shamed, Is by some comrade's hand reclaimed. âAnother look, the ford was clear, The foe was reeling to the rear; And now the smoke came deeper on, And Nora from our sight was gone. But still her voice rang high and loud: The speaker hid, the sound so near, It seemed some spirit of the cloud Spake those prophetic words of fear:â âToo late! too late!â this was the cry: âFly, Ringbolt, Ugo, comrades!âfly! The reinforcing foe is here!â âWhat followed then I scarcely know, Save that we dashed amid the smoke, And where we saw a red line glow, There fell our fiery battle-stroke: Like a mad billow of the main We broke upon those thundering banks, Then, drawing backward, formed again, To burst anew along their ranks. âFor hours the scene was still the same,â A sleet of lead 'mid sheets of flame; The hot hail round us hissed and roared, Through clouds of seething sulphur poured, Untilâwe knew not how or whyâ The day was lost! Our saddened view Between the smoke-wreaths' opening wrack Beheld the patriots falling back: The hour of victory had gone by! Still fighting, we our line withdrew, Scorning to yield or fly. âAnd now we gained a sheltering wood, Where (oh, it was a sight to whet The sword of vengeance keener yet!), Pale with the streaming loss of blood, By hireling foemen still beset, Beside his foaming charger stood The wounded, gallant Lafayette. âWe swept between, with scathing blow, Until his bleeding wound was bound: Each drop of his the cloven foe Paid double to the crimson ground, Until from off that field forlorn The noblest son of France was borne. âBut, oh, the sight, the last and worst, That now upon my vision burst!â I saw, beyond a thicket-screen, Pale Nora o'er a warrior lean: His head upon her knee she nursed, And held unto his fainting lip The can he scarce had strength to sip. A few swift leaps, we gained the place. Oh, be the hireling doubly cursed Who caused that noble breast to groan! It was my father's upturned face Which looked into my own. ââNay, son,â he faintly sighed, the while His features wore a struggling smile, âBe not dismayed, 'twill pass anon: 'Tis but a little loss of blood: I am content: my hand has done On many a foeman work as good; And some, methinks, will never tell Beneath what old man's sword they fell. But bear me hence: this trifling woundââ Then in my circling arms he swooned. Nay, start not: still it was not death,â His breast anon recalled his breath. âWe made a couch of fallen boughs, Which thickly strewed the woodland path, Torn by the cannon's flying wrath, And, with such speed as pain allows, Conveyed him to the cavern, where He rests in Nora's watchful care; Then, with the moon to light my way, I rode to tell how went the day.â V. THE BATTLE IN THE CLOUD. The red October by his tent Sits painted in his warrior-hues; Beside him lies, in peace unbent, The bow which he too soon will use. O'er all the hill-sides near and far He sees the wigwam-smoke dispread; There all his waiting warriors are, Streaked with their many tints of red. Through all the realm of elm and oak The blue wreaths of their pipes increase: Alas! the calumets they smoke Are not the sacred pipes of peace! They plan around their council-fire The ambush on to-morrow's track; They do but wait their warrior-sire To give the signal of attack. The smile upon his lip to-day, The dream-light in his plotting eye, Are but prophetic signs to say How fierce the arrow-storm shall fly. Thus Esther mused, as from her tower She gazed o'er misty stream and land: She knew 'twas but War's breathing-hour Ere he again, in all his power, Should wave his flashing battle-brand. Even there, beneath her very gaze, The invader's bristling lines were spread, Wrapt in the calm October haze, And, like the Indian autumn, red. From Delaware their scarlet ranks Reached even to the Schuylkill banks, So near the very mansion-wall Echoed the frequent bugle-call,â A sight to make a young heart sad, And all her patriot hopes destroy,â While Berkley's loyal breast was mad With uncontrollÃ©d bursts of joy. He gave the invaders every proof How much his wishes with them lay: Their flag was waving on his roof, His halls received them night and day; He even broached his buried store, And brought a dozen hampers out, Willing with generous hand to pour, Repaid by loyal song and shout. But one there was whose bowing plume Was chiefly welcome to Sir Hugh, And once before that banquet-room Had felt his presence through and through,â The same who on that long-gone night The maiden's swelling song had heard, Who deigned from his great warrior-height To stoop, and own his heart was stirred. Now oft in Berkley's ear apart He spoke about the maiden's hand: âThe heiress of such noble land, Sir Hugh, should have a noble heart.â And once, with condescending lips, He bowed and kissed her finger-tips,â Sufficient such approving sign From colonel of the royal line. Thus passed a few clam days away; And now the night was not yet gone, Its dreamy veil but half withdrawn, Fair Esther on her white couch lay, Her soft light melting through the shade; Her cheek against her hand was laid, Round which the dainty flaxen curls Were cast in little golden whirls, As Love's own toying fingers light Had twirled them o'er the pillow white. That rounded arm, that angel face, The breast that stirred the snowy frills, The whole light form of perfect grace, Which the soft covering seemed to trace As loving it with warm embrace,â All this the conjuring fancy thrills; Thrills with a sense of sweet restraint, As when before some sculptured saint, Or lovely vision poured in paint By some pure master, when his heart Was molten with the fire of art. Across her face strange shadows played, As if by struggling pinions made; For she was dreaming of the fray, Watching, amid the smoke-wreaths dun, Her Edgar bravely battling on, The fiercest hero of the day. She saw him riding midst the din That raged around the Warren Inn, And on Paoli's fearful plain, When Massacre the sword had drawn. The trumpet's near and startling strain, That fiercely shook the cloudy dawn, The drums that rolled their loud alarms, And legions springing up to arms, Flashed through her dream, and, when she woke, Upon her ear the tumult broke! Leaders were hurrying to and fro, Proclaiming far, âThe foe! the foe!â âThe foe! the foe!â rang over all, And woke the echoes of Berkley Hall. When Esther looked from her casement high, Fear trembling in her large blue eye, She stared against the vapor dank Of morning hanging gray and blank. A heavy fog enveloped Germantown on the morning of the battle, which, âtogether with the smoke of the cannon and musketry,â says Irving, âmade it almost as dark as night.â Great wrestling voices in the cloud, Made by the mist more clear and loud, Appalled her ear; the sudden roar Of swift artillery shook the shore; While here and there the half-blurred flash Burned, and every window-sash Answered to the thunder-crash. Anon she saw some warrior-form, Like the great genii of the storm, Rise into shadowy giant height, And then another of equal might, And now the followers swung in sight, Wielding great arms,âas oak with oak Were battling in the hill-side smoke; Or armies of the infernal god, With lightning and with thunder shod, Were wielding their gigantic blades Against the crests of kindred shades; Or, rather, as some pale, strange light Were shining on some unseen fight, And these the shadows fierce and tall It threw upon a cold gray wall, Struggling in many a rise and fall. A scene of horror clear descried Must make the stoutest spirit quail; But horrors doubly magnified Behind a half-concealing veil May well make maiden's cheek grow pale. She watched the sun rise o'er the field, A great disk like a bloody shield, And 'gainst it rose a vision dim, Made clearer by that burning rim, Two plunging riders huge and grim; Their fiery chargers seemed to swim Together in the wild commotion, Like war-barques in a roaring ocean. But who is he, that warrior slim, Now lost to sight, and now more plain? The agile form proclaims it him The object of her heart's devotion. But, see!âoh, monstrous!âeven the sun Burns redder, beholding three to one,â Three striking and one parrying! Now, Doubling the tumult of the scene, Another giant swings between! Swift flash the blades around his brow, Like lightning o'er some rocky crest, Drawn by the metal in its breast: But, like the storm-defying rock, Harmless about him breaks the shock; The battle-clouds, confused and rent, Are backward hurled, their thunders spent. Still side by side the heroes fight, Following the foe from left to right; Swift flies the Wagoner's whirling blade, And Edgar's is its very shade. See how they rear, and plunge, and smite, And, fighting still, wheel out of sight. Her throbbing eyes can bear no more: She sinks, half fainting, to the floor. But no! her heart is with the cause: Shall she thus sink away dismayed The while her Edgar's flaming blade Is flashing even as she bade? One deep, renewing breath she draws: She scorns the weakness thus displayed, Contemns the soul that now would pause, And gains her feet, no more afraid. Before his door, with sword in hand, Sir Hugh was making warlike stand, When a troop of loyalists came by, Uncertain if to fight or fly: Such contradictory news was tossed Through fogs that veiled the battle-din, They dared not say which side would win, But to their secret hearts within They owned the dreadful day was lost. One glance at Berkley Hall they threw, And saw the flag which o'er it flew: âHo, sirrah rebel! who are you?â They cried, and trooped around Sir Hugh. âRebel!â he echoed, in disdain: âWho dares such words apply again, This hand shall drive the lying breath Back to his throat through bleeding teeth; This sword shall cleave the caitiff through Who dares that insult to renew.â âHo! ho!â they cried,ââa prize! a prize! The rebel dog, through fear and shame, Would skulk beneath a loyal name; But where yon rag insults the skies We know full well our right to claim.â âThat rag? Insult?ââHe choked with ire; He said no more; his eye of fire Flashed confidently o'er the roof, Whenâoh, the staggering, deadly proof! His heart, as from a towering crag, Fell back, as stunned in dismal plight. Where now his valiant soul of might, The spirit never known to lag? There, sailing on the winds aloof, He saw the hated patriot flag, While Ugo's clear and ringing voice Flung from the watch-tower far and freeâ Making the misty air rejoiceâ The fiery shout of Victory. Bold Berkley stood with wonder dumb, Confused, as dead to sight and sound; But, when he felt his senses come, He chafed to find his arms were bound; And then, with high, indignant mien, Mounted two surly guards between, He left with threatening brow the scene. Sir Hugh long cursed the fatal hour Which saw that flag upon his tower: Oh, sad mischance that placed it there In that wild moment when despair Was trembling down the royal line,â When Victory, with her thrusting hand, Through blinding fogs, strove to consign Her laurel to the patriot band! âEvery account confirms the opinion I at first entertained,âthat our troops retreated at the instant when victory was declaring herself in our favor. I can discover no other cause for not improving this happy opportunity than the extreme haziness of the weather.ââ Washington to the President of Congress. And Berkley, ready for the field. At his own door, with waving sword, Stood threatening with defiant word The loyal troop which bade him yield. And, further, his accusers knew That members of the obnoxious crew At all hours, day and night, had been Prowling round Berkley Manor seen. All these were ominous proofs and black Which gathered on his troubled track: No word of his could move the shade Upon his loyal honor laid. Some favor still the doubt received: They would not touch his land or hall; His daughter might retain them all. This but in part his pain relieved: His fancy saw marauding bands Insult his house, o'errun his lands: His daughter, too,âmight she not be Subject to rough brutality? His fears were vain: his mansion through, When the withdrawing troop went down To hold their quarter in the town, Was guarded better than he knew. VI. HEADQUARTERS. O'er town and cottage, vale and height, Down came the Winter, fierce and white, And shuddering wildly, as distraught At horrors his own hand had wrought. His child, the young Year, newly born, Cheerless, cowering, and affrighted, Wailed with a shivering voice forlorn, As on a frozen heath benighted. In vain the hearths were set aglow, In vain the evening lamps were lighted, To cheer the dreary realm of snow: Old Winter's brow would not be smoothed, Nor the young Year's wailing soothed. How sad the wretch at morn or eve Compelled his starving home to leave, Who, plunged breast-deep from drift to drift, Toils slowly on from rift to rift, Still hearing in his aching ear The cry his fancy whispers near, Of little ones who weep for bread Within an ill-provided shed! But wilder, fiercer, sadder still, Freezing the tear it caused to start, Was the inevitable chill Which pierced a nation's agued heart.â A nation with its naked breast Against the frozen barriers prest, Heaving its tedious way and slow Through shifting gulfs and drifts of woe, Where every blast that whistled by Was bitter with its children's cry. Such was the winter's awful sight For many a dreary day and night, What time our country's hope forlorn, Of every needed comfort shorn, Lay housed within a hurried tent, Where every keen blast found a rent, And oft the snow was seen to sift Along the floor its piling drift, Or, mocking the scant blankets' fold, Across the night-couch frequent rolled; Where every path by a soldier beat, Or every track where a sentinel stood, Still held the print of naked feet, And oft the crimson stains of blood; Where Famine held her spectral court, And joined by all her fierce allies: She ever loved a camp or fort Beleaguered by the wintry skies,â But chiefly when Disease is by, To sink the frame and dim the eye, Until, with seeking forehead bent, In martial garments cold and damp, Pale Death patrols from tent to tent, To count the charnels of the camp. Such was the winter that prevailed Within the crowded, frozen gorge; Such were the horrors that assailed The patriot band at Valley Forge. It was a midnight storm of woes To clear the sky for Freedom's morn; And such must ever be the throes The hour when Liberty is born. The chieftain, by his evening lamp, Whose flame scarce cheered the hazy damp, Sat toiling o'er some giant plan, With maps and charts before him spread, Beholding in his warrior-scan The paths which through the future led. But oft his eye was filmed and dim, And oft his aching bosom yearned, As through the camp his fancy turned And saw sad eyes which bent on him The look which they in pain had learned. The sunken orbs of hunger there, With those that throbbed in fever-rage, As he their suffering might assuage, Turned on him their imploring stare. And when he spoke the kindly word Oft from his lips of pity heard, And saw those eyes grow bright the while They caught the courage of his smile, His sorrowing heart was doubly stirred. And, to relieve his burdened breast, His face into his hands he prest, And poured his secret soul in prayer, Where hope still rose above despair. And there was seated by his side The noblest of a noble line: Her whole soul in her face benign, Through love and suffering purified, Shone worthy such a chieftain's bride. And not alone his prayer was given,â She joined him in imploring Heaven: Those prayers fell not in barren sands Beside Oblivion's fruitless sea, But, borne aloft by angel hands, They bloomed to flowers of victory. The eve was late: naught met the ear, But tramp of sentinel marching near, Or soft and feathery beat of snow Blown light against the window-pane, To melt thereon, and tearlike flow, As if the sympathetic glow Within had turned each flake to rain. At times there came the slumbrous sound Of waters toiling at the mill, Still singing, though in fetters bound, The song learned on their natal hill. Let Winter, with oppressive will, Bind down the stream with chains of ice, His utmost power shall not suffice To keep that heart of Freedom still: Though prisoned in the frozen pond, It only reinforcement waits To burst the tyrant's heavy gates And leap to liberty beyond. Thus with the tranquil flood of power Within that camp of ice and snow: Though all was silent outward show, They did but wait the opening hour. The night was late: the chieftain heard Approaching footsteps up the yard: A knock: he rose, and gave the word: The door swung wide; the snowy guard Announced, with some unwonted stir, An unexpected visitor, With two attendants there beside. It was a maid with cloak of fur, And hood, so closely round her tied That well the storm had been defied. So thick the snow was o'er her blown, So flaxen was the falling braid Beside the rosy cheek displayed, She looked like some fair Norland maid Wrapped in a robe of eider-down. Beside her stood a youth whose mien Brought to the chief's remembering eye The stripling hero he had seen Bearing a banner proudly high, Within a light-horse flying line, That fearful day at Brandywine. The other was that sturdy dame The housekeeper: you saw it all In one glance at that stately frame, Queen of the keys of Berkley Hall. The maid a moment seemed to stand A bashed before that presence high: He read it in her timid eye, And took in his her trembling hand. She felt her young blood swifter run; Her heart could not regain its calm; Her little hand lay in his palm,â The noble palm of Washington! Then rose the lady, with serene, Sweet looks o'er all her stately mien; And she too took her hand, and spoke In winning accents low and mild:â âIt is a stormy night, my child, For one so young to be abroad;â Or have you wandered from your road? Pray, loose your snowy hood and cloak, And warm you well beside the fire, And take the rest which you require. Shrink not because the place is small: Our hearts, we trust, have room for all.â When Esther answered, âNoble friends, We have not wandered from our way, Nor need we now for warmth delay; Our glowing purpose freely sends Its heat, and we would straightway do The duty Heaven directs us to. âMuch have we heard of all the ills Suffered along these winter hills,â Of famine in the frozen camp, Of cheerless couches, cold and damp, Where sickness breathes its painful breath 'Mid bitter wants that usher Death. âHence have we come, with courage armed, With every deep compassion warmed, To do the little in our power To soothe the suffering of the hour. Our sleigh is standing at the door, Laden with such poor, hasty store As one home from its winter hoard Can to a bleeding cause afford: And now it but remains to ask Permission to assume our task.â She ceased, and stood with glowing cheek,â So beautiful, so young and meek, She seemed an answer to their prayer,â A very pitying angel there. The chieftain's eye grew dim with mist, His heart was all too full to speak; The lady's arm the maiden prest, She drew her to her matron breast And tenderly her forehead kissed. The chief put out his hands, and smiled,â He laid them on her golden hair, And said, in feeling words of prayer, âGod bless you, noble child!â VII. THE WINTER CAMP. 'Twas midnight in the soldier's shed, Where lay upon his burning bed The sufferer, to whose fever-glow Most welcome came the gusts of snow, On searching night-winds, icy thin, Through every cranny blowing in, Filling the place with frequent mist, That round the one poor taper hissed. Close at his side an aged man Sat, like a good Samaritan, Pouring the sacred oil and balm, His pains and spirit-wounds to calm. A cloth about his brow was bound, To shield a deep and stubborn wound; While round his neck the intruding air Lifted and fanned his thin gray hair. Across his knees his warrior sword Sustained the book o'er which he pored; The leaves were yellow, old, and stained, And oft by fluttering, rude winds stirred, But still his aged eyesight strained To read the sacred, unstained Word. But who was she who knelt beside, And held the sick man's hand in hers, Feeling such pain as only stirs The breast where love and truth abide? It needs but one glance to suffice To know those large and dewy eyes; But keener sight 'twould take, I ween, To recognize that altered mien Of him whose features scarcely prove The Edgar of her hope and love. But saddest of her painful lot To look into those eyes which burned, To find no answering look returned,â Those eyes whose gladness ever flew In love to hers, with pleasure new:â Alas! alas! he knew her not! A moment thus in prayers and tears Her bosom poured its flood of fears; But, conscious that, though blind with pain, His heart was hers, and hers lone, She summoned strength, and stood again Strong in his love and in her own. As one who on a battle-plain, Feeling his life-blood dew the ground, Seizes the scarf which love had bound With trembling hands his breast around, And thrust it in the bleeding wound To stanch the crimson tide of life, Then springs anew to join the strife, To give, perchance, the fatal blow Which lays the invading foeman low,â So rose the maid, and firmly prest His love into her bleeding breast, And strove, with all such hands can do, To win him back to health anew. It was a charmÃ©d sight to see How lovingly she came and went,â How like a sunbeam, silently, She cheered and warmed that winter tent. Her cloak of fur around the wall She hung, to intercept the blast; Across the door was spread her shawl, And every cranny was made fast. Nor here alone her care was given: She daily passed from shed to shed; The early morn, the noon, the even, Still found her near some sufferer's bed. And striving oft, as she had striven, There praying 'mid the sick and dead, She saw the chieftain's bowing head, And heard his word of courage said: Where'er they smiled there seemed to spread The soft and healing breath of Heaven. Not fruitless was her constant care, And not unheard her daily prayer: The blackest cloud of all was past; New sunshine filled the winter skies; Hope came to Edgar's couch at last: No more her face his glance denies; His soul responded through his eyes With all the warmth which love supplies. And with the first returning breathâ A breath as sweet as that which stirs Through April boughs, when all the woods Feel the first thrill of promised budsâ He owned his soul was doubly hers, Since she had called it back from death. One day, as by the scanty fire She strove to make it sparkle higher, The while her patient's slender form Was propt beside, and mantled warm, The old man, Edgar's patriot sire, Entered with overshadowed brow, And said, âSweet daughter, come with me: I fear another couch may now Lay claim to your fidelity. The strange wild woman you so oft Encountered in your winter round, And who so frequently you found Soothing the sick with accents soft,â Accents which suited not the dress, So fitted for the wilderness,â Now lies a victim to the spell Which she in others strove to quell, With fever sorely racked and thrilled, 'Mid kindly hands, but all unskilled. âI have not yet forgot the day When on the battle-field I lay Almost in death, she was the first To slake my fever-flame of thirst, Or how within the secret cave She tended me so well and long, Cheering me oft with some wild stave Of ballad or of mountain-song, And oft, as though I were a child (There's something in her brain amiss), Telling some legend strange and wild. For thisâBut nay,âit needs not this To wake compassion in your eyes:â A human creature suffering lies.â Then Esther rose, and joined her guide, And reached the shed where Nora lay; But, when she stood by Nora's side, Her heart of courage sank away. For, oh, it was a piteous sight To see those eyes so strangely bright, And all that flood of scattered hair As blown by winds of wild despair, And all the trappings of her dress Flung wide by hands of hot distress! There Ugo by the wagoner stood, And both in anxious, gloomy mood; She stared upon the wondering child, Then wept as o'er some burning thought, Then gazed at Ringbolt strangely wild, And laughed, as though her pain were naught. The saddest of all sounds that flow Is laughter forced from deeps of woe. A moment on the maid she glanced, As if her spirit hung entranced, And now, with curious, searching scan, Surveyed the pitying, gray-haired man, And spoke with low, mysterious air:â âThou poor young bride, beware! beware! Oh, wed not with that cold white hair! That summer smile is but device:â His breast is snow, his heart is ice. Oh, cold was the bridegroom, All frozen with pride!â He first slew her lover, Then made her his bride. Ringbolt, how goes the battle? Ho! Fly, Ugo!âfly!âthe foe!âthe foe! A stealthy trick!âbut they shall know The stricken can return the blow! The tyrant and his host shall flee,â When patriots strike, they shall be free! âOur flag like a meteor Sweeps down through the fight: It brightens the valley And burns on the height. âOh, did you not see How it sprung like a flame When the voice of the nation Called Freedom by name? âOn the soul of the tyrant That mighty name fell, As in Gessler's heart quivered The arrow of Tell!â Thus sang she, and fell back with breath Drawn faint as through the lips of death; The life within the frame consumed Seemed scarce again to be illumed. Then Ringbolt gazed on her with eye Of pain,âalmost of agony,â And said, with heavy, solemn tongue, â'Tis hard for one so good and young To suffer thus! The poor white dove Was murdered by a falcon's love!â Then Esther said, âIndeed, my friends, It is a sight which sadly sends The blood back on the heart, to see Such depths of human misery. Oh, surely this wild, dismal camp Is all too rough and cold and damp: 'Twere better if she were conveyed And in some quiet chamber laid, 'Mid hands that know to tend and spread The comforts of a sufferer's bed, Where pity only holds control, With not a sound to vex the soul. And such a room my heart allows, Within a well-provided house, And well I know her couch will find The hands attendant, gentle, kind; For Hulda, ever good and mild, Will guard her as she were her child. Haste, Ugo, haste, and bring the sleigh, And let her be enwrapt straightway: 'Tis but a short two hours' ride; So easily her course shall glide, So deep shall be her bed of fur, So soft and noiseless be the stir, That she may sleep and never know How swiftly fly the miles below.â A moment there was seen to go O'er Ringbolt's face a blackening cloud: At length his nodding forehead bowed: âPerchance,â he said, â'twere better so.â The sleigh was brought, and many a fold Of fur and blanket wrapt her form: And now within the wagoner's hold, Like a light infant, close and warm, She lay,âand thus, beside the maid, To Berkley Mansion was conveyed. He bore her up the shadowy stair, The 'wildered sufferer knew not where, And in a chamber warm and large He left her in kind Hulda's charge. A cup of wine,âbluff words of thanks,â If Esther would regain the camp, Ugo must be her guard and guide,â The great hall heard his heavy tramp, The deep snow marked his giant stride, Which led him up the Schuylkill banks To join again his waiting ranks. VIII. THE HERALDS. Days came and went round Nora's couch: If there was need of aught to tell That gentle hands attended well, Her mild and altered mien could vouch. Weeks came and went, and every day Brought better news from out the valley: Each tiding-tongue was glad to say The troops, the cause, all seemed to rally. And Esther's heart, though still her sire Was captive in the royal camp, Saw Hope re-fan her smouldering fire Within the cloud's desponding damp. 'Twas evening, and she watched the gleam Of moonlight over hill and stream; Though winter now was wellnigh through, And spring-time promised soon to blow, Still, all the scene which met her view Lay in a gleaming robe of snow. She sat and gazed upon the stars, As on a banner there unfurled, And wondered if each sparkling world Was shocked like this with martial jars,â If through those tranquil, silver skies Stern warriors bent devoted eyes In worship on the planet Mars. She mused,âwhen Hulda's waking hand Was laid upon her resting arm, And, looking up with mild alarm, She saw within the moonlight stand Another, whose brave feet had paced Through paths of snow in breathless haste. âI comeââthis was her hurried word, She scarcely seemed for breath to pauseâ âTo you, for I have often heard Your heart is with our patriot cause: You have swift horses at command, And have, perchance, some trusty hand By whom a message may be borne: The word I bear must reach our band Before to-morrow morn.â âSpeak on!â the startled hearer cried: âIt shall, no matter what betide!â âOur enemy a plan has laidâ I got the news, it boots not howâ By which our camp shall be betrayed, And all our noble army made To bite the dust, or basely bow. This was their threat; and even now Their rapid horsemen form in line, And ere the dawn 'tis their design To strike the fatal blow. âThis is the news: I pray you speed; The hour is short, and dire the need: I have no time to answer more; But if our noble chief would know The source from which these tidings flow, Then tell him boldly, undeterred, 'Tis Lydia Darrach's faithful word, âMrs. Darrach's Conduct.âI have very direct and certain evidence for saying that Mrs. Lydia Darrach, the wife of William Darrach (a teacher, dwelling in the house No. 177 South Second Street, corner of Little Dock Street), was the cause of saving Washington's army from great disaster while it lay at Whitemarsh in 1777. The case was this. The adjutant-general of the British army occupied a chamber in that house, and came there by night to read the orders and plan of General Howe's meditated attack. She overheard them when she was expected to have been asleep in bed: and, making a pretext to go out of Frankford for flour for family use, under a pass, she met with Colonel Craig (who afterwards shot himself) and communicated the whole to him, who immediately rode off to General Washington to put him on his guard. The next night, about midnight, the British army, in great force, marched silently out of Philadelphia. The whole affair terminated in what was called, I believe, the action of Edgehill, on the 5th of December; and, on the 8th following, the British got back to the city, fatigued and disappointed. Lydia Darrach and her husband were Friends. She communicated all the particulars (more than here expressed) to my friend Mrs. Hannah Haines, and others. Although she was a small and weakly woman, she walked the whole distance, going and coming, bringing with herâto save appearancesâ twenty-five pounds of flour, borne upon the arms all the way from Frankford. The adjutant-general afterwards came to her to inquire if it had been possible that any of her family could have been up to listen and convey intelligence, since the result had been so mysterious to him.ââ Watson's Annals. A similar stratagem was planned to surprise Washington at Valley Forge; but, the fact being communicated in time, the enemy was foiled by the sudden and unexpected appearance of Lafayette and his corps on the banks of the Schuylkill. Which served him once before.â âThanks, noble heart!â young Esther cried, And flung her daring tresses wide: âSpite every danger or mishap, Ere yon low moon shall disappear, The news shall reach our General's ear Though Death stood in the gap!â Waiting no more to hear or say, The herald took her homeward way. âNow, Ugo!ââthis was Esther's call,â âBridle the swiftest steed in stall, Fly with the news you just have heard, And let our chieftain know the word.â âA steed!â he answered; âbut suppose The road should be beset with foes, The boldest rider scarce would do To bear such needful tidings through. No, no: I have a better way,â One quite as swift, and far more sure; Nor horse nor man my course shall stay, I shall be mounted so secure.â She stared at him with puzzled brow, But he nor look nor answer stayed; She heard the rattling which he made Within the dusky hall below; She saw him dash across the snow, Until he gained the frozen river, Watched him a moment bending low, Then, like an arrow from the bow, Beheld his flying figure go On skates, with many a flash and quiver, As if the glistening ice and steel, In lightning, would his speed reveal. The smile applauded the device: She watched him, with a glad surprise, Until he vanished from her eyes. But suddenly, with fear renewed, She stood in anxious attitude:â That messenger upon the ice, It might, and yet might not, suffice. If highways held the foeman wolf, The river also had its gulf, And 'twas the season when the sun Old Winter's work had half undone; The snowy eaves were thawed at noon, The thinning ice must vanish soon; The moon, too, hung with sinking disk; Her light would shortly be at end. No, no: it would not do to send One messenger on such a risk: All must be staked to win or lose; In such a cause, who stayed to choose? In haste she ordered out the sleigh: None heard the maid her purpose say; 'Twas not for others' ears discussed, For there was none whom she would trust, Save Hulda, and her duty lay Round suffering Nora night and day. Alone she mounted, without pause, To save, perchance, her country's cause: Away, away, the light car flew; The hoofs flung up the powdery snow; Swift as a river seemed to flow The road beneath, where, slipping through The crispy foam with whistling shrieks, The runners left their glistening streaks. Oh, enviable star in heaven That looked through that still crystal even, And saw how those two heralds went, Each on the same high mission bent,â One on a road of ice below, One on a stream-like road of snow, The locks of each flung backward far, And trailing like a meteor star: Oh, ne'er before sped soul with soul In holier race for earthly goal! Just as the last hill-top was neared, And the swift horses slackened pace, A voice, as if it broke through space, Pealed to the welkin as it cheered, Announcing the last danger cleared:â 'Twas Ugo's wild, triumphant mirth, Ringing as it would circle earth. And thus the two young heralds met, In spite of foes about them set, In spite of dark and wintry weather, And to the grateful patriot chief, In burning language plain and brief, Delivered their great news together; And soon the horses, flecked with foam, Well pleased, were turned again for home. While Ugo took the guiding rein, Thus held the maid her musing vein:â âNow the moon has left her track, Dropt behind the mountain-bars; Paly shine the cold white stars, And the pale earth answers back; All the world a shadow lies, Darkly, breathless, deathly still, While above us hang the skies, Throbbing to our throbbing eyes, Till the fancy almost hears Something of the strains that thrill, Passing through the happy spheres. âYonder the great Northern Wain Rings across the azure plain, Nightly rolling toward the goal Of the ever-steadfast Pole: Every steed in that great car On his forehead wears a star, Proud with bells upon his mane. âSweetest of the chimes of heaven, Is yon clustered sister-seven, In their turret's misty height, Like a stem of lilies white,â Our sweet valley Pleiades, Ringing perfume on the breeze. Ring, sweet sisters, clearer still: My heart listens for the thrill From your sacred belfry-cell: Pour your chime; but, ah, the knell Floats from off your silver lips For that lost one in eclipse! âLost!âah, no: she is not lost; Her song was too fine and sweet With your singing to compete; On some more celestial coast She is now the angels' boast, With her joy forever told, In a tower of shining gold. âRing, sweet stars of heaven, anew, And my heart will sing with you; Ring!âoh, ring!âthat I may hear And feel that heaven is sometimes near.â Thus Esther in her happy breast The pleasure of her soul confest; For she was glowing with a sense (Although the thought had scarcely heed) That she had done a sacred deed Which was its own sweet recompense. The singing sleigh, the horses' tread, Slow pacing homeward at their will, The flowing road that backward sped, The stars that chased her overhead, Like heavenly guardians with her still, The crystal air, but not too chill, All soothed her with a gentle calm, As if a cool and tender palm Were on her tranquil forehead prest To woo her into peaceful rest. And Ugo held in dreamy spell The reins which seemed about to fall; But homeward steeds remember well The road which leads them to their stall. All nature seemed as it were fanned With Slumber's cool and downy pinions: But, hold!âthe steeds are at full stand! Around them close the foeman's minions! Is she awake, or does she dream? The sword-flash that before her stirs, The scarlet coat, the helmet's gleam, The bursting laugh of rude derision, A rough voice shouting, âPrisoners!â A soldier at each horse's rein, And Ugo dragged among the train,â All this proclaims it is no vision. The boy is loud,âhe will not stay: A boy is he, armed soldiers they. âWhat men are ye,â she strove to say, âWho dare to stop a lady's way? I charge ye, off! Unbind the boy!â Whereat the captain's voice replied, Close at the startled maiden's side, âLady, we wish not to annoy Further than strictest duty calls: Be not alarmed: if aught befalls Amiss, the fault shall not be ours,â We serve the cause of higher powers: Though it seem hard, and you condemn, Our prisoner, you must go to them.â He took the reins, and said no more: With mounted men to guard them down, Even past her own unhappy door She went a captive to the town. PART III. I. THE TANKARD OF WINE. Oh, what delight is in the air What time the new-born spring is there! How sweet it is on the breezy slope, 'Mid flowers in bloom or about to ope, When the dog-wood, like a maiden dight In bridal robes of snowy white, Beside the flaming maple stands, While the oak, with priestly hands Spread above their bowing heads, His whispering benediction sheds; Where never a careless wind forgets To tell of the woodland violets, Or how it half forgot to pass From spice-wood boughs and sassafras; And, like the soul of a mocking-bird, Repeating every song it heard, Each sweeter for being brought afar, As all the joys of memory are. Such Esther knew were the delights Clothing the valley and the heights; And every perfumed air she met, Fresh breathing of the wood and field, Filled her with longings and regret For joys the city could not yield. Had she a pleasure in her breast, In secret it was all suppressed; For every look and every tone Proclaimed her Melancholy's own. 'Twas true, her captive chains were light,â Another might have deemed them bright; But, light or bright, she felt the pain Of knowing that there was a chain Which flowers, though twined with subtlest art, Could not make welcome to her heart: They could but hide from others' stare The galling weight she knew was there. The city and its farthest street Were free to her unfettered feet; But there was still that line beyond, O'er which her feelings, wildly fond, Took yearning wing, and well she knew She could not follow where they flew. Sir Hugh grew daily more appeased: He mingled with the martial court, His fetters seemed but things of sport, And even now might be released If he in any slight degree Would bow and sue for liberty. But no! they had assailed his pride: His loyalty had been denied: He would not bow the suppliant limb,â Nay, rather they must bow to him. And now, too, all he held most dear Next to his pride, his child, was here, And many a noble officer Bowed supplely low to him and her; And even those with hearts allied In secret to the patriot side Made him obeisance; for they deemed He might be other than he seemed. These flattering tributes to him paid Gave sweet contentment, and he stayed. 'Twas twilight, and the evening air Came dancing over Delaware, Fanning the easy sailor's hair, Who laughed and quaffed away his care, With merry song and gusty din, Under the stoop before the inn, Where soon, arrayed in colors fine, Two officers of the royal line Reeled singing in at the open door, A flush with pleasure and with wine: 'Twas noble, they said,âor rather swore,â With such a general to dine. Each face was scarlet as their dress: The whole man seemed to loom and shine, As if the red blood of the vine Its glowing presence would express By every visible outward sign. âHo, landlord of the âShip and Sheaf,â Bring us a flagon, and be brief! We must not let the tide go by, To leave us stranded high and dry, Or wait to-morrow's evening flood To lift us o'er the sand and mud; 'Twill never do to stick aground While other barques are sailing round: Let loose the wine, and, should that fail, Then swim us off with good brown ale!â Thus shouted they, then searched the gloom, To note what guests were in the room: Their glance found only two beside. âTwo fellows there I think I spied,â Thus whispered one. âNay, there are more,â The other answered,ââsurely four: But two, perchance, are made of wine!â Whereat they laughed; and still they swore 'Twas noble, glorious, and divine With such a general to dine. âHo, landlord, bring another flask, To nerve us for to-morrow's task! To-morrow's task! Ah, that will be A scene of such rare chivalry That all shall go joy-mad to see! A thousand times more bright and fine Than Germantown or Brandywine! How those poor devils in the gorge, Hidden away at Valley Forge, In their tatterdemalion rags, Making their empty rebel brags, Would ope their boorish eyes to gaze Upon the splendors which shall blaze And burn, until the night is spent, Around our glorious tournament! Come, landlord, drink, before we go, A bumper to the royal show! âThat fellow there, who seems to sulk And in the shadowy corner skulk, Go bring him out, and let him clear His throat, that he may loudly cheer The golden glories he shall see Around to-morrow's pageantry! Come, sirrah, when a colonel bids, Nor sit with scowl like pirate Kidd's: This smile will smooth your hostler frown When it washes the hay-dust down!â The stranger rose: through a sideway door He pushed a young companion out, Then stood a moment as in doubt, The while he scanned the revellers o'er, Then strode to the table with visage grim, Demanding what they would with him. âTo drink our general's health!â they cried. âOur general!â boldly he replied, And drained the goblet willingly. âAnd to our tournament beside!â âAnd to the tournament!â echoed he; âAnd may I be on hand to see!â âAgain!â the other cried, with zest; âFill high!âmethinks that were a breast To hold a gallon in its chest,â And let the toast be to the fair,â To her whose colors I shall wear,â The badge of the âBurning Mountainâ mine, âThe maid I loveâ my motto sign. Then pledge for whom I set the lance, With whom in banquet I shall dance,â Perchanceââhe hiccoughed, and waved his wineâ âTo her who may be bride of mine,â I have the father's word for all: Or, if not thatââwith drunken leer He whispered in his comrade's ear, Then laughed till the cup was nigh to fall, And shouted, âThe heiress of Berkley Hall!â The stranger's tankard was ready up; Each his lip was about to dash, When, with an oath like a thunder-crash, He flashed the wine in the speaker's face And into the other's the empty cup, And then, with heavy, giant pace, Strode leisurely beyond the place; And, ere they woke from their disgrace, A light boat and a springing oar Had borne the wagoner far from shore. II. THE MESCHIANZA. âThe Meschianza was chiefly a tilt and tournament, with other entertainments, as the term implies, and was given on Monday, the 18th of May, 1778, at Wharton's country-seat, in Southwark, by the officers of General Howe's army, to that officer on his quitting the command to return to England. âThe company began to assemble at three or four o'clock, at Knight's Wharf, at the water's edge of Green Street, in the Northern Liberties; and by half-past four o'clock in the afternoon the whole were embarked, in the pleasant month of May, in a âgrand regattaâ of three divisions. âWhen arrived at the fort below the Swedes' Church, they formed a line through an avenue of grenadiers and light-horse in the rear. The company were thus conducted to a square lawn of one hundred and fifty yards on each side, and which was also lined with troops. This area formed the ground for a tilt or tournament. On the front seat of each pavilion were placed seven of the principal young ladies of the country, dressed in Turkish habits, and wearing in their turbans the articles which they intended to bestow on their several gallant knights. Soon the trumpets at a distance announced the approach of the seven white knights, habited in white and red silk and mounted on gray chargers richly caparisoned in similar colors. These were followed by their several esquires on foot. Besides these, there was a herald in his robe. These all made the circuit of the square, saluting the ladies as they passed, and then they ranged in line with their ladies; then their herald (Mr. Beaumont), after a flourish of trumpets, proclaimed their challenge in the name of âthe knights of the blended rose,ââdeclaring that the ladies of their order excel, in wit, beauty, and accomplishments, those of the whole world, and they are ready to enter the lists against any knights who will deny the same, according to the laws of ancient chivalry. âAt the third repetition of the challenge, a sound of trumpets announced the entrance of another herald with four trumpeters dressed in black and orange. The two heralds held a parley, when the black herald proceeded to proclaim his defiance in the name of âthe knights of the burning mountain.â Then retiring, there soon after entered âthe black knights,â with their esquires, preceded by their herald, on whose tunic was represented a mountain sending forth flames, and the motto, âI burn forever!â âThese seven knights, like the former ones, rode round the lists and made their obeisance to the ladies, and then drew up, fronting the white knights; and the chief of these having thrown down his gauntlet, the chief of the black knights directed his esquire to take it up. Then the knights received their lances from their esquires, fixed their shields on their left arms, and, making a general salute to each other by a movement of their lances, turned round to take their career, and, encountering in full gallop, shivered their spears. In the second and third encounter they discharged their pistols. In the fourth they fought with their swords. âFrom the garden they ascended a flight of steps covered with carpets, which led into a spacious hall, the panels of which were painted in imitation of Sienna marble, enclosing festoons of white marble. In this hall and the adjoining apartments were prepared tea, lemonade, &amp;c., to which the company seated themselves. At this time the knights came in, and on their knee received their favors from their respective ladies. From those apartments they went up to a ball-room, decorated in a light, elegant style of painting and showing many festoons of flowers. The brilliancy of the whole was heightened by eighty-five mirrors decked with ribbons and flowers, and in the intermediate spaces were thirty-four branches. On the same floor were four drawing-rooms, with sideboards of refreshments, decorated and lighted in the style of the ball-room. The ball was opened by the knights and their ladies; and the dances continued till ten o'clock, when the windows were thrown open, and a magnificent bouquet of rockets began the fireworks. These were planned by Captain Montresor, the chief engineer, and consisted of twenty different displays, in great variety and beauty, and changing General Howe's arch into a variety of shapes and devices. At twelve o'clock (midnight) supper was announced, and large folding doors, before concealed, sprung open, and discovered a magnificent saloon of two hundred and ten feet by forty feet, and twenty-two feet in height, with three alcoves on each side which served for sideboards. The sides were painted with vine-leaves and festoon-flowers, and fifty-six large pier-glasses, ornamented with green silk, artificial flowers, and ribbons. There were also one hundred branches trimmed, and eighteen lustres of twenty-four lights hung from the ceiling. There were three hundred wax tapers on the supper-tables, four hundred and thirty covers, and twelve hundred dishes. There were twenty-four black slaves in Oriental dresses, with silver collars and bracelets. Toward the close of the banquet, the herald with his trumpeters entered and announced the king and royal family's health, with other toasts. Each toast was followed by a flourish of music. After the supper, the company returned to the ball-room, and continued to dance until four o'clock in the morning. âI omit to describe the two arches; but they were greatly embellished: they had two fronts in the Tuscan order. The pediment of one was adorned with naval trophies, and the other with military ones. âMajor AndrÃ©, who wrote a description of it (although his name is concealed), calls it âthe most splendid entertainment ever given by an army to its general.â The whole expense was borne by twenty-two field-officers. The managers were Sir John Wrotlesby, Colonel O'Hara, and Majors Gardiner and Montresor. This splendid pageant blazed out in one short night. Next day the enchantment was dissolved; and in exactly one month all these knights and the whole army chose to make their march from the city of Philadelphia.â Watson. O city the beloved of Penn, How was your quiet startled when Red Mars made your calm harbor glow With all the splendors he can show! How looked your tranquil founder down That day upon his cherished town,â That town which in the sylvan wild He reared and tended like a child? Methinks that patriarch and his peers, Who fashioned all your staid retreats, Groaned then in their celestial seats With sad offended eyes and ears; And, had their loving faith allowed, That day, in mournful spirit bowed, Each had turned his olive-wand Into a rod of reprimand. The May was there,âthe blue-eyed May; The sweet south breeze came up the bay, Fanning the river where it lay Voiceless, with astonished stare,â The great sea-drinking Delaware. There, in the broad, clear afternoon, With myriad oars, and all in tune, A swarm of barges moved away, In all their grand regatta pride, As bright as in a blue lagoon, When gondolas from shore to shore Swam round the golden Bucentaur On a Venetian holiday, What time the Doge threw in the tide The ring which made the sea his bride. 'Mid these were mighty platforms drawn, Each crowded like a festal lawn,â Great swimming floors, o'er which were rolled Cloth of scarlet, green, and gold, Like tropic isles of flowery light Unmoored by some enchanter's might, O'erflowed with music, floated down Before the wharf-assembled town. A thousand rowers rocked and sung, A thousand light oars flashed and flung A fairy rainbow where they sprung. Conjoining with the singers' voice, In ecstatic rival trial, Every instrument of choice, Mellow flute and silver viol, Wooed the soft air to rejoice; Till on wings of splendor met, Clearer, louder, wilder yet, Clarion and clarionet, And the bugle's sailing tone, As from lips of tempests blown, Made the whole wide sky its own, Shivering with its festal jar The aÃ«rial dome afar. Thus the music past the town Winged the swimming pageant down, Till with one loud crash it dropt, And the bright flotilla stopt, Mooring in the bannered port At the flowery wharves of Sport. There wide triumphal arches flamed With painted trophies, which proclaimed. With mottoes wrought in many a line Around some brave heraldic sign, That all the splendors here displayed Were honors to great chieftains paid. Pavilions round the field were spread, With flying banners overhead, Where, on a high and central throne, The two commanders reigned alone: The admiral, whose powdered hair Had oft been fanned by ocean air; The general, whose eye oft sped O'er fields transfused from green to red, As if the very plain should wear The hue his army held so dear,â Both deeming that the world must bow Before the awful name of Howe. And there,âoh, feast for painter's heart, And yet a light to mock his art, To kindle all a poet's fire, To waken, madden, and inspire, Yet leave him mastered and undone, As faints a taper in the sun,â Yes, there, in many a beaming row, Was lit such beauty as might glow Alone in fabled tourney-rings; Held in those far enchanted scenes Where all are princesses and queens And all the jousting knights are kings. Such light was then our city's boast; And such, methinks, it has not lost: The features Stuart loved to trace And clothe in his immortal glow Are met by many a soul-lit face, Secured by Sully's touch of grace, As bright as theirs of long ago. O noble masters, might I here Seize the light pencil from your grasp, Then should the picture reappear Which vainly I attempt to clasp. What though the vision with me stays, The awkward pencil tamely strays, And leaves me, after all my cost, To sigh above my labor lost. But ye who have the conjuring will, The painter's gift, the poet's heart, Take the rough lines I cannot fill, And touch them with your clearer art. In middle of the central groupâ The fairest maidens of the troop, Each in her flowing Turkish dressâ Sat Esther, in her loveliness. A graceful turban bound her brow, Its end flung back in gauzy flow, And from its sides hung loops of pearls, Dripping among the golden curls, While on its snowy front was set A diamond stellar coronet, And in the middle of the stars A red rose shone, like burning Mars; The silken robe, of ample fold, Was white, and bound with belt of gold, O'er which a scarf of wondrous lace Added its wealth of flowing grace. Her beauty thrilled the gazing crowd, And made the heart of Berkley glad; But if Sir Hugh that hour was proud, Still prouder was the stripling lad, Brave Ugo, who beside her chair, With height and form beyond his age, Stood near, her guardian and her page; His large dark eyes and raven hair To hers made contrast rich and rare; And, decked in Oriental suit, He looked a Turk from head to foot, Holding superb and tranquil mien, As by the throne of a sceptred queen. Now rang the bugle to the cloud; And now seven knights, in brave attire Of white and scarlet gayly donned, On chargers well caparisoned, And each attended by his squire, Rode in before the admiring crowd; And soft eyes sparkled brightly fond, As each before his lady bowed. Then rang the herald's trumpet higher, And swelled the challenge fiercely loud:â âThe brave knights of âThe Blended Roseâ Proclaim the fair whom they defend Are lovelier, nobler in their pride, Than all the world can show beside; And he who dares this vaunt oppose We challenge to the direful end!â Three times abroad the vaunt was thrown; And now another bugle blown, Flinging its scorn around the heaven, Ushered in the answering troop,â The gallant and defying seven, In suits of orange and of black, With harnessed steeds and squires to back; And these with proud and knightly stoop Made their obeisance to the fair Whose beauty they defended there. Then swelled the other herald's cry:â ââThe Knights of the Burning Mountâ defy, And, in support of their ladies' charms, Challenge all chivalry to arms!â But how looked Esther on the scene? Was there no pleasure in the place, To call the color to her face? A weary sadness veiled her mien; Her eye, which took the splendor in, 'Mid all the show no joy could win; For in her patriotic heart Another picture, far apart, Rose, with its drear, contrasted shade, Before her sympathetic eye, Which glistened with a pitying damp. She saw the starving valley camp, And heard the sufferer's dying sigh,â Saw all the bitter wants that weighedâ Her country's only hope and trustâ A noble army to the dust; And even when her champion proud Bent low, a gallant knight in black, She scarcely noticed that he bowed; Her sad eye paid no glances back. Again the flying bugle's flash Across the waiting scene was pealed; Then came the sudden shock and dash Of spears that met in splintering crash On every loudly-ringing shield. Then sword with sword together rang With many a fierce and fiery clang, As on some earnest battle-field. Oh for the pen which brave Froissart Waved, sword-like, in the knightly van! Oh for the pencil and the art Of battle-loving Wouverman! That on my page might be unrolled Another tourney âcloth of goldâ! All eyes were on the struggle bent, And every gazer forward leant, Each breathless at the whirling sight,â When dashed in midst another knight, Driving the raging foes between, And, like a whirlwind, joined the scene. His tall and foaming steed was black, And reared and leapt with plunge and wheel; And he who loomed upon his back Wore on his breast a plate of steel, While on his head a helmet shone With flying plume,âthe visor down. The armor was embossed and rich, And seemed to Esther to recall The helmet and the breastplate which Formed part of that within the niche,â The ancestral suit of Berkley Hall; As if the knight, so grim and tall, Finding the ancient form too small, Content to shield his head and breast, Had borrowed but cuirass and crest. His raining blows were swift and bold: No sooner was his weapon set 'Gainst every lifted blade he met, Than flew that blade from out its hold; While many a bravest knight, alarmed, Recoiled apace, abashed, disarmed. But when he met the searched-for foe, Fair Esther's champion in the list, His mighty hand could not resist,â He dealt an angry, giant's blow,â Perchance it was intended so: Somehow, the awkward weapon missedâ It glanced beyond the approaching head, And on the âblack knight'sâ mouth instead Alit the great hilt-clinching fist! A blow that made the earth swim round, And sent him bleeding to the ground. Then, while the murmur questioned loud, He dashed to the wondering maid and bowed, And raised her white glove to his lip. Now seemed her eye to understand; She guessed that form of high command, And felt a folded paper slip Stealthily into her startled hand; Then, like an eagle on flashing wing, He sailed beyond the wondering ring. All marvelled; but few guessed the truth: They mostly thought it in the play; And even the knights, with frowns uncouth, And many a savage inward oath, Were pleased among themselves to say That some hot-headed frolic youth Had chosen thus to share the day, By dashing in the jousting fray, To bear the highest prize away, And leave them all in wondering doubt, As oft in ancient tourney-bout. The two commanders, looking on, Approved the novel action done, And said, in accents loud and bluff, The brave surprise was well performed, And that it was a knightly thing, Although, perchance, a little rough. And catching this, as from a king, The shout of joy ran round the ring, Till every clapping hand was warmed, To send the applause on circling wing. And now the day was wellnigh spent, And evening closed the tournament. III. THE BANQUET. Oh, merry and good is a blooming wood On a calm, clear afternoon, When every maid, in a flowery hood, Sings, as every maiden should In the leafy shades of June:â When every light form wears the proof Of what beneath her homestead roof The loom of Winter weaves.â The blue, and green and scarlet woof, The white and flowing sleeves:â When every archer bends his bow, To bid the laughing arrow go Among the laughing leaves! And merry the call to a Christmas hall, Where nuts and ale abound, Where music, with gusty rise and fall, Chases the revellers dancing all In many a mazy round. But louder, clearer, merrier yet The music and mirth together met What time the evening feast was set And the tournament was through: The knights came in, each waving plume Sending a murmur through the room, And, bowing to eyes they deemed most sweet, Each knelt before his lady's feet, To receive the trophy due. But where was Esther's champion? Had he no tourney-honor won? And must the flower her turban wore Remain unclaimed, and feel the blight Of all that withering festal light? She plucked the rose with fingers white, And tore the leaves before their sight, And strewed them on the floor. That feasting-hall was a sight to see, And, seen, it must remembered be: A hundred banners lined the wall, Festooning over swords and spears, And thrice a score of chandeliers Made such a glory through the hall As only summer noonday wears; And many a mirror, wide and tall, Decked with flowers on golden piers, Caught the splendor, and echoed it all, As if to stretch the gorgeous place Into the outer halls of space, As it were to last a thousand years. All, all was bright as summer waves That sing and dance on a flowery shore, Where the billow decks the bank it laves With pearls, and then retreats for more. The only shadows around the feast Were a score of turbaned, Nubian slaves Arrayed in livery of the East. The merriest sounds o'erflowed the scene, While flashed the brimming wine between, Where each, from the cup he loved to quaff, Caught something of its vineyard laugh. There was whispered love, soft words of bliss, On lips Adonis would die to kiss, Rustle of silks, and rattle of fans, Tinkling of glasses, and, crowning this, Music that swelled from invisible clans:â Till, closing his eyes, the listener heard The rush of a woodland waterfall, And all the leaves of the forest stirred By a flutter of wings, and the noisy call Of every loudest-throated bird. The feast was past, the toast was said, The inevitable speeches made, And the long-cheered, triumphant two Breathed easier, and drank anew. 'Twas now that one of the leading knights Bowed, and, with soft persuasion long, Prayed, as a wreath to their delights, Our maid would crown the hour with song. In vain her timid lips demurred: The praise of her voice so much was heard, They would not take the denying word. In view of this, a harp had been, Only a moment past, brought in. And there in a flood of light it shone Golden on its waiting throne. At length, upon her father's arm, And bidding her page beside her stay, She went, though tremorous with alarm, And AndrÃ©, bowing, led the way. She gained the throne, and sat thereon: Her breath came short for such a need; One glance across the room she sent, A thousand eyes were on her bent; They seemed a thousand arrows drawn, And she the victim that must bleed. One long sustaining breath she drew, Her drooping lids shut out the view,â Till, suddenly dashing her veil aside, And flinging her golden ringlets wide, Her arms around the harp she pressed, Loving it with her loving breast, As if its touch her fears might smother. And now her hands along the strings Flashed daringly across each other, As when two birds, at dividing wires, Outsinging all the woodland choirs, Flutter with half-invisible wings. When climbed her fingers high and higher, Twinkling among the treble notes There seemed unnumbered silver throats, Thrilling the sky with wild desire; Then sudden lightnings flashed their fire, Till, in the heavier chords below, The thunder dealt its rumbling blow; And now the rain was shivered down, And all the tempest-bugles blown. Then came her voice: at first 'twas low, Like a sweet brook among the rushes; But, like that brook, its further flow Swelled soon to fuller, nobler gushes. SONG. I. In the vanished time and olden, Ere the ages yet were golden, A great king ruled his misty isles In sullen state alone, Till, hearing of a maiden With marvellous beauty laden, He swore she must be brought to him, To tend beside his throne. II. And forthwith every vassal Who dwelt beside his castle Was sent to bring the maiden in Before the morrow morn; And straightway to her bower They went in all their power: But she met them with her noble mien And scorned them with her scorn. III. âGo, tell your tyrant master Earth threatens no disaster So direful to a maiden's soul As is a monarch's smile; That Death shall wed me rather 'Neath the roof-tree of my father, Than I should serve the greatest king That ever ruled an isle.â IV. Then laughed they loud derision At the poor defenceless vision Of a simple maid who dared alone Defy their mighty king; âThen come,â they cried, âthe trial; Our lord brooks no denial: Your slender wrists must bear the bands Our master bade us bring.â V. But, firm in her reliance, With a glance of fierce defiance She looked into their cowering eyes, That drooped as in disgrace! But, remembering royal anger, With a sudden clash and clangor They drew their mighty falchions forth And flashed them in her face. VI. A moment, as in sadness, She looked upon their madness, With calm, white arms serenely there Upon her bosom laid; Then, with no thrill of terror, But smiling at their error, Three times she clapped her snowy hands, And signalled thus for aid. VII. Three times her palms resounded, And at once she stood surrounded By noble brothers rushing in From every native field: Their forms were rough and tawny, But their limbs were lithe and brawny, And, instead of taking captives there, The captors now must yield. VIII. And, against their own consenting, She sent them back repenting. The mad king cropt their coward ears To satisfy his wrath: And still that noble maiden, With all her beauty laden, Went singing on her happy way, With honor in her path. Scarce had the last word left her tongue, And while the chord still trembling hung From which the bird-like note had sprung, There rose a tumult wild without, âWhile the British were indulging in the festivities of the night of the Meschianza, below the city, McLane was busy with a stratagem to break them up. He had one hundred infantry, in four squads, supported by Clough's dragoons. At ten at night they had reached the abatis in front of their redoubts, extending from the Schuylkill to the Globe Mill. These divisions carried camp-kettles filled with combustibles, with which at the proper signal they fired the whole line of abatis. The British beat the long roll, and their alarm-guns were fired from river to river, and were answered from the Park, in Southwark. The ladies, however, were so managed by the officers as to have taken the cannonade for anything but the fact, and therefore continued the sports of the night. But the officers in charge on the lines understood the nature of the assailants, and gave pursuit and assault. He retired to the hills and fastnesses of the Wissahickon. After daylight the British horse were in full force to pursue him, and finally took his picket and ensign at Barren Hill. McLane was afterwards attacked, and swam his horse across the Schuylkill, when some of Morgan's riflemen appeared to his protection. He then turned upon his pursuers, driving them in turn into their lines near the city.â Watson. A hurried rush of loud alarms, The flash of flames, the sentinel's shout, With startled drums that beat to arms. The shuddering guests no more could doubt, But quaked to think the rebel crew Had burst in all their midnight power Upon them, in their revel hour, To act the Trenton scene anew. What meant that glow whose fearful shine Illumined the abatis-line, Which fired the scene, as if to light The horrors of the coming fight? Now could they hear the mounted troop Like hungry vultures round them swoop, And see the clattering hoofs of steel Where lightning flashed from every heel. Out rushed the guardian ranks aflame, To put the intruding crew to shame; But, strange to tell, without a blow, To say that there had been the foe, The troopers fled, and left behind Their mocking laughter on the wind. The guards pursued them past the town, By the same road which brought them down, And soon the sentinels descried The line returning, flushed with pride. Then laughter filled the hall again, While pleasure took the place of pain, And every happy face was lit With this fresh source of mirth and wit, And music spread its circling wing To lead the dance in ampler swing. But what was wrong? What ailed Sir Hugh? Why sought he thus the assembly through? What were the questions he would pour At every outward-leading door? At last he stood, with sigh long drawn,â Both Ugo and the maid were gone. One said that while the guardian troop Had gone to beat the rebels back, He saw descend a hasty group Across the lawn, and some were black,â A part of that same turbaned horde Who tended while the wine was poured,â And that they moved towards a barque:â To shield them, then, the white moon bowed Behind a heavy wall of cloud:â He saw no more, for all was dark. IV. THE BROTHERS. What light illumes the eagle's ken, And flames his breast with Freedom's rage, The first wild daring instant when He soars beyond his broken cage! How glows the lion's eye of fire, Brighter than lit with midnight ire, The moment when he sees the bar Half drawn that leaves the door ajar! How proudly he exalts his mane That first hour on the open plain! When from the winter's captive hold The young spring takes the freedom won, While all his fetters crystal cold Melt like a vision in the sun:â Then every river, brook, and rill Feels its deep heart with pleasure thrill; Then sing the birds, and every tree Waves its gay hands for jollity. What joy, my own dear land, was thine, What pleasure filled thy breast of sorrow, As if the heart were pulsing wine,â What glorious sunshine filled the noon That cloudless, jubilant day in June Which said, âThe foe will leave to-morrow!â âTo-morrow!â every glad eye-glance To that sweet music seemed to dance: Youth spread the shout from first to last, And Age new vigor seemed to borrow, And stranger-faces, as they passed, Looked that masonic word, âTo-morrow!â The happy country heard afar The answer of its long desires; Swift sped the news from hill to hill, O'er plain and valley wandering still, As if on every mountain-bar Was lit the flame of signal-fires. And there were eyes in Berkley Hall, That, bright before, were now more brightâ Young breasts that in their rise and fall Were thrilled with uncontrolled delight. Yet there beneath the Berkley roof Were looks that angered at the proof,â Dark, sullen brows, which seemed to say The morn would bring a hateful day. 'Twas hard to see the old reins slip From out their doting monarch's grip; And so, to nerve them for the worst, The purple flask must cheer the hour, That they at least might slake their thirst For wine, if not for tyrant power. âTo-morrow, Colonel, you depart:â This was the greeting of Sir Hugh. âBelieve me when I say my heart Is sad to part with such as you. I hoped ere thisâbut hopes are vain: There is a higher Wisdom rules:â Though wise His ways, they are not plain: 'Tis strange, and yet He sometimes deigns To give an empire's guiding reins Into the hardy hands of fools:â I hoped ere thisâthat hope at least Holds good, and shall not be deniedâ To see my family-board increased, To see my daughter at your side A lovely and contented bride. âHow stands your glass? The room is dim: Methinks the twilight settles soon, In spite of the long days of June; And yonder rises the red moon, As if wine flushed her golden brim. So flush your glass; for wine, in truth, Which sparkles in these founts of ours, Is that perpetual Spring of Youth Which Ponce de Leon strove, forsooth, To find within the land of flowers. Then never let our spirits sink, Though Time and Fate their worst pursue, While at the bacchanalian brink Our hearts their courage may renew. âAy, courage,â'tis the soldier's word: The hour is brighter than it seems; To-day, even while you stood deterred, I caught from hope some clearer gleams. âDid you not notice, when we came, And after my first warm embrace, How flushed her cheek and eye with flame When she looked up and saw your face? I felt her little wild heart leap, That moment, in my clasping hand: For Love, when he would safely keep His head in secret hiding deep, Is but an ostrich in the sand. âWhat though her look no hope awakes, Repelling with disdainful eye, 'Tis but the course the salmon takes, In scornful distance pausing shy; Just when you think your toil is vain, And when he chiefly shows disdain, With sudden whirl he takes the fly! What though her mien conceals the spell, Believe me, friend, she loves you well. âWho spoke? Who dared to give the lie? Ho, Steward! lights!â The lights were brought, And every secret hiding-place Was peered into with angry face. The furious searching furnished naught To meet his pistol's ready rage, Except a parrot in his cage: Yes, surely 'twas that silly bird Who uttered the obnoxious word. They laughed, and sat: the wine must serve To smooth again the ruffled nerve. âTo prove, my friend, my words sincere, I have the paper ready here.â Thus spake Sir Hugh. âIt only waits For the contracting names and dates: 'Tis quickly done. There, mine secures The seal; and now, my friend, for yours. By Jove! your pen flies o'er the word With all the flourish of a sword! âThe maiden's name? Ah, never doubt: That with the rest shall soon appear. Ho, Steward, seek your mistress out And bid her to attend me here!â In Berkley's breast resolve was stern, For in his proud parental heart, Remembering with what willing art Her favor took the patriots' part, He felt a deep resentment burn. Although he loved her fondly still, Yet, though all else should be denied, She should not set her rebel will Against this last hope of his pride: It may be that the flush of wine Gave vigor to his fixed design. Young Esther came: her eye was bright As if 'twere brimmed with love's own light; Then flowed her maiden accents clear, âWhat would you, father? I am here.â âA trifling service,â he replied;â There was a strangeness in the tone Which turned her inmost heart to stone:â âBefore these written names are dried, Let yours be drying at their side.â With wondering countenance advanced, Her eye across the paper glanced; Her visage showed a lightning-blight,â The color from her cheek was blown, As when from off some festal height The fierce bolt strikes the banner down. Before her flashed the ready quill, The black blood waiting at the point; Across her swept a deathly chill That agued every sinking joint: A very statue, mute and white, She stood, till came the order, âWrite!â âNay, father: any thing but this,â If 'twere to die at your command!â He answered, âMy sole order is To write! The pen is in your hand!â 'Twas there; for he had placed it there,â He seized her by the slender wrist.â âOh, help!â she cried. âNay, to assist In your rebellion who shall dare?â He answered firmly, at the word, Tapping his pistol and his sword. Her hand was on the paper prest: Both watched it with their anxious ken; The blood was curdling in her breast, A deadly pallor veiled her mien, The room swam round in darkness,âwhen An iron hand was thrust between, Which snatched and crushed the crackling pen! Three paces back, with shuddering reel, All started, in their horror dumb; Their tongues even as their hearts were numb; For there a voiceless form of steel Stood glowering as with threatening will; For, though the visor close was down, The very iron seemed to frown, The clinching gauntlet grasping still The crumpled remnant of the quill. Within the waning light and gloom To giant size it seemed to loom: Such necromantic power has fright To give to objects double height. While now the gazers stood aghast, The form, with slow and backward pace, Confronting still with iron face, Retiring, reached the throne at last Where stood the maiden's harp of gold. Still paler grew the lights and dim,â Or so the frighted fancy told,â While phantom lustre seemed to swim About that form so ghostly grim; And, just behind, the moon's broad rim Seemed to the very casement rolled, A spectral chariot waiting him: The gazers' blood ran doubly cold And palsied every limb. But stranger still it was to see The form slow sinking on one knee, Upon the harp's enthroning stand, While in his stretching arms he took The frame, whose chords in terror shook Ere scarce they felt the iron hand. Slow o'er the strings the gauntlets stole:â (That gloves of steel showed little skill In answering to the player's will, Such audience would scarcely wonder;)â But, with a strange, weird music still, That wailed above, then rumbled under, He played as 'twere a funeral dole Chanted by distant winds and thunder; And when from out the helmet broke The words in many a dying close, It seemed as if a cavern spoke The burden of long-hidden woes. SONG. I. A shade has crossed the hill, Sir Hugh, A shade has crossed the lawn; And where its phantom feet have gone, So lightly were they pressed thereon, They did not brush the evening dew, Sir Hugh. They did not brush the dew. II. A gloom is on your house, Sir Hugh, Your sire frowns on the wall,â Where frown those painted shadows all, Now pale and shuddering o'er your fall: The last of all the name are you, Sir Hugh, The last of all are you. III. Your royal cause is lost, Sir Hugh; Your king recoils aghast; His day of tyrant power is past: Of all his friends you are the last, Last of your cause and name are you, Sir Hugh, The last of all are you. IV. The last of all are you, Sir Hugh, Echoes the owl aloof,â The last of all,âupon the roof The whippoorwill prolongs the proof:â Adieu to Berkley Hall,âadieu, Sir Hugh, To Berkley Hall adieu. âBehold! Sir Hugh, be not dismayed!â The suitor cried, and drew his blade. âDo you not see it is the same Who boldly to our tourney came A rough, unbidden guest and foe? I have not yet forgiven the blow: Though it were years, in twice the gloom I still would know that helm and plume.â Through Berkley's brain the lightning sped, And, casting round his glances quick, Sir Hugh the empty niche espied; Then, with an angry laugh, he cried, âA trick! By heaven! a rebel trick!â And scarcely had the words been said, The room was blinded with a flash: The iron vision forward sprung, And reeled the frighted group among; And now the floor received the crash Of one who falls in armor dead. Alas! if there was aught within But ghost, to brave that bolt of lead, That shining breastplate was too thin! The door, by sudden fury thrust, Swung wide, and hurrying men strode in, And one, whose voice was like a gust, Cried, âWherefore all this murderous din?â Then, following Sir Hugh's wild stare, He saw the fallen armor there, And saw from out the iron seam A mortal tide of crimson stream. With hurried stride he crossed the floor, And knelt beside the pool of gore, With rapid hand the visor threw, And started backward at the view, One look told all,âno need of more:â From out its sheath his weapon flew. âBehold,â he cried, âO wretch, behold The murderous work your hand has done! Ay, stare upon that visage cold, And recognize, mad fool, your son! But, while there's strength within this hand And steel of vengeance in this brand, Your heart shall pour a stream as good, Even though I shed a brother's blood!â That moment he had forward sprung, But Esther on his right arm flung Her form, and there she pleading clung. Then stood Sir Hugh as one who seems Chained amid horrid nightmare-dreams; Though fain to fly the sight of gore, His feet were frozen to the floor. At length he stammered, still with stare Fixed on the pallid visage there, âA lie!âa lie! I had no son, And surely never such a one!â To which the other cried again, âThy son, proud fool, and son of her Whose noble heart by you was slain,â O cold and double murderer!â Still staring with unmoving eye, He said,âor rather seemed to sigh,â âI never killed her: if she died, It was not hereââ âYour bitter pride Struck at her heart, until her brain By many a cold, proud word was slain!â The wagoner answered; and the taunt At last awoke the Berkley blood. âWho dares,â he cried, in furious mood, âThus in my face such words to flaunt? And who art thou, who ne'er before Save once, a rude, unwelcome guest, Was known to enter at my door? What rebel thou, whose coward breast Dares breathe the insult uttered now?â âPray, not so fast,â the other cried. âA moment clear your clouded brow, And let your memory allow I am not one to be defied! That picture there may well attest Whose courage ever was the best, And which it was who quaked with fear The moment danger came too near. I scorned you even as a child, Proud, cold, and selfish as you were; A younger brother, oft reviled, I would not be your pensioner, And so I left you to yourself, With all your boasted pride and pelf. âA rebel!ânay, let that foul name Flush your own coward cheek with shame: 'Tis ye are black Rebellion's knaves, Traitors to Freedom and to God, Who dare upon this sacred sod Exalt the slave-compelling rod, Being slaves yourselves, to make us slaves! âWhile throbs a heart,âwhile Heaven is just,â While on the banner of our trust One star remains to fight beneath, No blade of ours shall seek its sheath, No cannon hold its direful breath, Till on the bitter field of death The bold enslaver bites the dust. Already, even as pictured there, The joy has oft been mine to take In this good grasp the tyrant snake And fling him writhing in despair.â âMy brother, thou?â Sir Hugh replied, The while the wagoner's form he eyed, Scanning in scorn, from head to foot, The patriot's rough and rustic suit. â'Tis false! No Berkley scion yet His high-born lineage could forget, To wear such rude and menial form And be the thing which thou art now!ââ He spake, and back recoiled a pace Before the anger of that face: He dared no further brook the storm Which gathered on that threatening brow. But now his troubled eye again Was cast upon the stripling slain, And, with a look which strove in vain To hide the doubt within his brain, He cried, â'Tis false! No blood of mine E'er wandered vagrant through the land; No Berkley son would raise a hand In honor of the rebel line! No child of mineââ His speech was stayed; He glared upon the trembling maid. âWell mayst thou tremble!â he resumed, âAnd sink with burning shame consumed, Whose recreant heart and rebel eye Now give our loyal blood the lie! 'Tis thou, with disobedience long, This sad and direful scene hast wrought,â Firing the youth with rebel thought And filling his soul with rebel song; But that shall end!â And, at the word, Across the harp he flashed his sword And severed every trembling chord. âStrike on!ââthis was the wagoner's taunt: âSuch courage ever was your vaunt: With no more stripling sons to kill, On other innocents wreak your fill!â âStill must I hear?â Sir Hugh replied; âAre my assertions all denied? The boy was never son of mine, Though harbored long beneath my roof: In shades condemned, or realms divine, That truant woman's wandering ghost No Berkley offspring dares to boast:â I challenge every proof!â The wagoner turned, and whispered, âHark! What never misery thrills the dark? What voice is that approaching near? Sir Hugh!âSir Hugh!âlook up and hear!â Thus as he spoke, a mournful air Seemed winding down the shadowy stair, Still nearing and more near; and soon The words came clearly with the tune. SONG. I. Oh, cold was the bridegroom, All frozen with pride: He first slew her lover, Then made her his bride. II. Beneath a green willow, And under a stone, They buried her lover, And left her alone. III. With naught but the bridegroom's Proud breast for her head, Oh, how could she live when Her lover was dead? IV. Her body they buried Beside the church wall; Her ghost with the bridegroom Sat up in the hall:â V. Sat up at his table, Lay down in his bed:â Oh, cold was the bridegroomâ But colder the dead! The singer entered. Was it a ghost, Or sleeper walking unaware? Her large eyes, as in revery lost, Bent forward their unearthly stare; Wild o'er her shoulders fell her hair; Her face was like her garments white: Her thin hands bore a wavering light. Which shed a pale and mournful glare Across those features of despair. Still forward walked that form of awe, As if her wide eyes nothing saw, Until, in middle of the room, The centre of that scene of gloom, She cast a slow, dull glance around, And looked as she had nothing found: Across their very faces past Those eyes to which all seemed a blank, Till on the floor her glance was cast; And there, as that look was her last, She gazed upon those features white; From out her fingers dropt the light, And on the armored breast she sank. It needed but that last wild gust Of grief to blow from Nora's frame Life's low, unsteady, flickering flame, And leave it dark and soulless dust. âSir Hugh!âSir Hugh!â He was not there: Sir Hugh was gone, they knew not where. But there the haughty suitor stood, His bright sword flashing in his hand, As if the keen, defying brand His nuptial claim should still make good. This saw the wagoner, as he laid On Edgar's arm the fainting maid; And, ere the soldier was aware, He stood without a weapon there: His sword was in the patriot's hold, Who with a look of scorn surveyed The face so lately flushed and bold; Then, with contemptuous movement fleet, Across his knee he snapped the blade, And flung it at the wearer's feet, And now, the wide door pointing through, Exclaimed, with sad but threatening brow, âDepart! The place is sacred now: Go, follow thou Sir Hugh!â CONCLUSION. My friend abruptly closed the book: I felt as one who long had sailed Gazing with anxious landward look,â Who, just as the fair port is hailed, And the rough prow goes dipping in, Suddenly hears the anchor's din, And, lo! the ship is at full stand: There move the people on the land, And there are voices from the beach, But mournfully all out of reach. My face the crowding questions wore: He said, âA little patience yet, And soon the landing skiff and oar Your feet upon the shore shall set.â Then at the sinking fire his hands Gathered and piled the sundered brands, Until the hearth was reillumed: â'Tis thus,â he said, âthe story stands:â A fallen end or two demands To be regathered and consumed. âHow goes the wine? 'Tis rare and old: Or do you taste the earthy mould? Some seasons past, while men of mine Were hollowing out an ample space To give our hothouse-wall its base, I stood to watch them bravely delve And see they followed well the line, When suddenly to its very helve The pick went in with crush and crash, Spattering all with a purple splash; And when withdrawnâoh, murderous sign!â 'Twas bathed in the streaming blood of wine. How it came there to you is plain, And this brings up Sir Hugh again. 'Tis said that on that night of pain He rushed into the moonlit air, And sped for hours he knew not where, Through fields and woods, by the river's brim, With two sad phantoms following him;â How once, just as he thought he saw The crowning horror of his awe, The murdered stripling in his path Rise with confronting eyes of wrath, He reeled and staggered, fainted, fell, And lay at the feet of a sentinel; And when he awoke, and the horrid mists From off his aching brow were blown, He found himself within the town, Among the guards of the royalists. âHe recognized the hand of Fate; And, after writing a hurried scrawl, Giving his daughter Berkley Hall As some may not be aware of the baronial style in which certain of the early settlers of our country lived, and fearing that the description of âBerkley Hallâ might be thought overdrawn, the author again avails himself of the invaluable âAnnalsâ of Watson to select a couple of passages:â âThe Wharton Mansion, in Southwark, fronting the river, back from the present Navy-Yard, was a country-house of grandeur in its day. It was of large dimensions, with its lawns and trees, and, as a superior house, was chosen by the British officers of Howe's army for the celebration of the Meschianza. Wilton, the place once of Joseph Turner, down in the Neck, was the nonpareil of its day. It was the fashionable resort for genteel strangers. Every possible attention was paid to embellishment, and the garden cultivation was superior. The grounds had ornamented clumps and ranges of trees. Many statues of fine marble (sold from a Spanish prize) were distributed through the grounds and avenues. The mansion-house and out-houses, still standing, show in some degree their former grandeur. The ceilings are high and covered with stucco-work, and the halls are large.â âDuchÃ©'s House.âThis was one of the most venerable-looking, antiquated houses of our city, built in 1758 for Parson DuchÃ©, the pastor of St. Peter's Church, as a gift from his father. It was taken down a few years ago. It was said to have been built after the pattern of one of the wings of Lambeth Palace. When first erected, it was considered quite out of town (corner of Third and Pine Streets), and for some time rested in lonely grandeur. It afterwards became the residence of Governor McKean; and, when we saw it as a boy, we derived from its contemplation conceptions of the state and dignity of a Governor which no subsequent structures could generate. It seemed the appropriate residence of some notable public man.â And his blessing with the broad estate, He boarded a ship and felt more free While bidding adieu to river and bay; But his heart was withering day by day, And at last they buried him far at sea. âThe lovers? Ah, more sweet the lay Should be which sings of those so dear: It is not long since, old and gray, My sainted parents passed from here. âIf 'twere not that the fire is low, And chanticleer awakes to throw His midnight signal on the air, A sacred scene should newly glow Of that beloved and loving pair. âMy mother's favorite seat was there, And this my father's high-backed chair: How clearly comes the long-gone scene When I a child sat here between! âOne night,âI well recall the hour,â Just when our second war was past, The winds were howling o'er the tower, The snow its gulfy deluge poured, And up the chimney like a blast The flame from off the hickory roared, Against the outer door a blow Sounded like a blacksmith's sledge, And, waiting no further privilege, Entered, it seemed, the Prince of Snow,â A veteran of giant height, With wild locks like his garments white. The heavy stamping and the beat, Which piled a drift within the hall, Rang through the house and wakened all The echoes to announce his feet. So thick the cloud he scattered wide, And so majestic was the fling, He seemed a very arctic king Throwing his furry robe aside. âMy sire, awakened by the stir, Gazed through the door with shaded eyes, Puzzled a moment with vague surprise; But when he saw that giant size, And heard the voice of bluff replies, He knew and welcomed the Wagoner. âHad you beheld him stride the floor, You ne'er had guessed how many a score Of years had blown their changeful air Through those white locks to whiten there. âWe offered him this cushioned seat: He took you great oak chair instead,â It felt more saddle-like, he said,â And flung him down with widespread feet. ââ'Tis seventy years,â he cried, âor more, Since first I backed a good stout steed; And though to-day with as fearless speed I rode as in the days of yore, I know that wild, free course is o'er. It boots not to prolong the strife: That brave, old-fashioned, cheery life Is ended. My contented grip Resigns at last the guiding reins: No more my bells o'er hills and plains Shall ring, as once, through these domains. And therefore I have brought my whip, To hang it up in Berkley Hall, To see it grace yon antlers tall Which hold those old swords on the wall, The rusty weapons of Sir Hugh: The honor is its well-earned due.â âWe welcomed him with hearty will, And wished him many bright years still, Then brought the wineâwe knew the sortâ And brimmed a goblet with old port. Through the red cup he gazed awhile, In musing, with a strange, sad smile. ââGood Uncle Ralph,â my mother sighed, Dropping the embroidery in her lap, âOne question I have often tried To solve; and yet, through some mishap, It seems conjecture wandered wide: But you, I think, can solve for me Poor Nora's mournful history.â âThe old man looked at her a space, Looked vaguely in her upturned face, As if endeavoring to recall The far scenes of the past, and said,â âFor her sake you should know it all, For my sake, too, when I am dead; But first, my friends, let me make clear The reason I to-night am here. ââBeside the old churchyard to-day The surly sexton crossed my way: He glared at me with sidelong leer, And flung his spade across the wall. Just then a hurrying team drew near: The horses, wagon, bells, and all (Believe me, 'twas a marvellous sign) Seemed like the very ghosts of mine; The driverâfor once I held my breath, To see the flash Of his maniac lashâ Was a rattling skeleton, grim and tall; His shout was the hollow shout of Death! ââMy team, with many a plunge and rear, Went mad, then stood like frighted deer, While I sat like a girl aghast, Until that awful wagoner passed; And when I looked behind, 'twas gone, And we were in the road alone. ââThink not that superstitious fright Could cheat my ear or mock my sight; Although the calendar counts me old, My heart is as the youngest bold. Brave Percy, when his charger stood First on the field of Brandywine, âAmong the gayest of the gay, as a volunteer in the suite of one of the British generals,âas tradition informs us,âwas a sprightly and chivalrous descendant of the Percys. He was a noble and generous youth, and had volunteered on the present occasion as an amateur, to see how fields were won. As the young Percy came over the brow of the hill, he was observed suddenly to curb in his impatient steed, and the gay smile upon his lively features, changing at first to gravity, soon became sad and pensive as he glanced his bright eye over the extensive rolling landscape, now rife with animation. The wide prospect of gentle hill and dale, with forest and farm-house, the bright waters of the Brandywine, just appearing in one little winding section, in a low and beautiful valley on the right, formed of itself a picturesque view for the lover of the simple garniture of nature; all combined to make up a scene which it would hardly be supposed would have damped the ardor or clouded with gloom the fine features of a young officer whose proud lip would at any other moment have curled with scorn and his eye kindled with indignation at the remotest intimation of a want of firmness in the hour of trial. Yet, with a subdued and half-saddened eye, the young Percy, who but a moment before was panting to play the hero in the contest, paused for a moment longer. Then, calling his servant to his side, and taking his diamond-studded repeater from his pocket,ââHere,â said he, âtake this and deliver it to my sister in Northumberland. I have seen this field and this landscape before, in a dream in England. Here I shall fall. Andââdrawing a heavy purse of gold from his pocket ââtake this for yourself.â. Saying this, he dashed forward with his fellows. The most obstinate fighting during the engagement took place near the centre, which rested upon the little stone meeting-house of the Quakers, and in the graveyard, walled on all sides by a thick stone mason-work, which, with the church, are yet standing as firmly as at the period of which we are writing. This enclosure was long and resolutely defended by the Americans; and it was near this place, about the middle of the action, that the noble young Percy fell, as he believed he had been doomed to do. The enclosure was at length scaled, and carried by the bayonet. The wounded were taken into the meeting-house, built by the peace-makers for the worship of the God of peace, though now the centre of the bloody strife; and the dead were inhumed in one corner of the burying-ground in which they had many of them been slain. Just before our visit, a grave had been dug, and the remains of a British soldier disinterred. A part of his shoes remained: a few pieces of red cloth, a button likewise, marked â44th Regt.,â and a flattened bullet. âprobably the winged messenger of death to the wearer,âwere also found; both of which were given to us by the good man near by the meeting-house.â Watson. Beheld, in clear, prophetic mood, The spot which should receive his blood; He saw his form's distinct outline Stretched on the sod,âhis steed, in fright, Dashing riderless through the fight; Then instantly he galloped on, And sought the fate he could not shun. ââIt is a bitter night; the cold For the first time now makes me old: Another cup of this warm wine Perchance will give the blood a start, And thaw the chill about my heart, And clear this hazy brain of mine.â âAgain his vague eye scanned the glass, As if he saw old memories pass In many a long and wavering line; And, as he held the glowing cup Between him and the lamp-light up, The color of the deep wine threw Across his face a purple hue: I could but shudder where I stood, It looked so like a dash of blood. âAt last he spoke in under-tone,â âThose grand old times are past and gone; But, Esther,ââhere his eye grew bright With something of its former light,â âDo you remember how of old Around our cause your numbers rolled? I ever loved a fiery song; But there was something in your voice Which made the listener's heart rejoice, His eye of courage burn more bright, And filled him with a fierce delight That did not to the words belong: To hear again such music sung Would make a veteran heart grow young.â âMy mother's cheek turned somewhat red To hear the praise so bluffly said; It seemed to bring the vanished days What time her song was used to praise. She looked, and smiled, and shook her head, And said her voice had lost its power, Her singing summer day had sped, And she was in her autumn bower; The water of a spring-time brook Makes plenteous music through the land. But surely 'twas an idle look Which sought it in October's sand; Her harp, too, since that night of pain Had never known its chords again. âBut still within her secret breast She thought to humor him were best: What though her voice had somewhat failed, His aged ear, so long assailed By Winter, could not be o'er-nice, The sense so long inured to storm Might deem the cadence still was warm, Nor note its chill of autumn ice:â And thus, to please an old man's whim, With folded hands, she sang to him. SONG. I. When sailed our swift eagle O'er valley and highland, The foe, like a sea-gull, Fled back to his island,â Fled back to his king-land, His home in the ocean,â The white cliffs of England, His pride and devotion. II. Now peace and contentment Fill cottage and manor; No star of resentment Is lit on our banner. Our cannon is sleeping The port-shadows under; The spell in its keeping Let naught break asunder. III. The impotent taunt let Go by,âthe wind brings it; But not the red gauntlet, No matter who flings it. Who palters and falters, Ne'er hearken his story, But strike for your altars, For Freedom and Glory. ââNay, never say,â the old man cried, âYour voice is like a brooklet dried; But rather say 'tis filled again, O'erflowing with the autumn rain. ââIt carries me back, both brain and heart, As if a gale swept o'er the scroll; I see the storied past unroll; And now, methinks, I may impart Something of Nora and the child. âMy memory is a restive colt, Stubborn at times, contrary, wild, At the wrong moment apt to bolt; But wine upon an old man's lip, To such a steed, is spur and whip.â âThen laughed he his accustomed laugh, That shook the glasses on the board, And, with a long and breathless quaff, The wine across his lip was poured: The goblet dropt from out his hold, And crashed to fragments on the floor; Slow sank his chin, slow drooped his lid, His heavy hands beside him slid; He slept,âay, slept,âbut breathed no more, And left the story still untold. âAs when some monarch of the trees, Which held so long defiant state Against the lightning and the gale, O'erborne at last by its own weight, While laughing in the passing breeze, Falls prone in the astonished vale,â So fell our grand old Hercules.â A SUMMER STORY. âThe simple story of two lovers young.ââ Shelley. TO H. D. R. My nobler self, before me there, You sit with tresses backward rolled, A glossy flood of delicate gold, Relieved by the plush of the purple chair, And into those eyes of violet-blue I gaze till my heart, in a depth of dew, Melts, and all their celestial hue Veils me in Etrurian mist, And floods my soul with amethyst. From beautiful brow to rounded chin, The pale rose, under the pearly skin, Glows like a glow-worm in the cell Of a rare translucent lily-bell, The while along your tender cheek Light flushes of pleasure play hide-and-seek, And on your spotless teeth of snow, The heart its reddest bloom has set, The sweetest and dewiest that ever yet On womanly lip was seen to glow:â Thus while you sit in your beauty and bloom, Helped on by the kindly light of your glance, With silver shuttle and golden loom I weave for you this light romance. I. A SUMMER STORY. My beautiful Ralph and Rosalie, They live in a village of ancient elms, Whose depth of shade the town o'erwhelmsâ Like sunbeams through the shadows cool, For years they have brightened the path to school; Their lightsome feet, And laughter sweet, Making a May-day in the street:â A May-day, every day of the year! With lilacs and violets breathing near, Dewy and odorous, fresh and clear; And each is crowned with the flowers that blow In the scented deeps of the heart below, In the dawn and the dew of Love's young morn:â Wake, herald, a wake your silver horn! Till the sordid many, and noble few, Shall know at last on earth are twoâ A gain to us, to heaven a lossâ A golden pair not marred with dross, Born in a glowing Ophirian grove In an El-Dorado realm of love. My beautiful Ralph and Rosalie, They are wandering down where the fields are blithe, Through butterfly lanes, over butter-cup banks, Where the sweet-brier breathes its odorous thanks To the sun and the air, While here and there A fragrance springs, On invisible wings, Up from the clover that dies on the scythe. A little further, they find the brook, And their faces catch the laughing look Of the liquid sprite o'erwreathed with glee, With dimples changing instantly, And bubbles that saucily wink as they pass Coquetting among the rushes and grass. Oh, next to being a human soul, With a destiny higher than earth's control, 'Twere to be a never-failing stream, With the crystal wealth of the hills to teem For ever and ever, and sing alway Through meadows green and forests gray, Over pebbles brown, and sands of gold, Hither and thither sportively rolled, To leap, as it were, at a lover's call, With clapping hands, from the dizzy fall, And fling the silvery spray on high, An incense to the loving sky, And, with this mystic veil o'errun, Call out young Iris from the sun. Already, barefooted, my beautiful boy Has leapt to mid-stream, with that jubilant joy Which only youth knows, and he stands with his tresses Thrown free to the sunlight that goldenly blesses. Full twice seven summers and one, Those tresses have deepened and curled in the sun. âOh, come!â he looks,â'twas but the call That spoke from out his lustrous eye, Two souls in such sweet tender thrall May still commune though speech should die. It cannot be resistedâsee! The dainty slipper-shoon are drawn, The stockings follow; light as a fawn She steps adown the daisy lawn, And meets his laugh with maiden glee. A little chillâa breath caught in, And under the crystal, the delicate skin Of the lovely feet of the beautiful girl, Shine pure as opalescent pearl; And as she moves with gentle stir, Feels crystal anklets clasped on her By watery fingers, and hung with bells Of bubbles that ring their own quick knells. Ralph takes her delicate hand in his, He puts one arm about her waist, So fearful those dear feet might miss, If on a slippery slant stone placed. With laugh and blush they onward wade Till at last their beautiful limbs invade That deeper pool, with swifter swells, Where the hermit trout securely dwells, Of which the baffled fisherman tellsâ That fabulous trout in every stream, Haunting the anxious angler's dream. A little waterfall just ahead Breaks to spray on the rocky bed; The rocks are mantled with mosses green, And tangled wild vines half-way screen The face of the fall, till it seems to be A cell for the hermit Secrecy. And in front of this fall an island lies,â A couch, and no more, of flowers and moss,â Its fringe of white lilies, along and across; Its in woven vines, and the feathery floss Of the bloom of the grass, make a sweet surprise, To kindle new light in an artist's eyes, While its odors of many a mingled scent Hang round the place like a gauzy tent. The clear pool deepens; and at the hem Of Rosalie's dress drip water-pearls; And every wave that round her whirls Leaps up to add another gem. And there the little fluttering maid Stands half in ecstasy, half afraid, Till stoops the youth, with enclosing arm, And lifts her from the watery harm; Folds on his breast her budding grace, And feels this moment in his embrace Is clasped more beauty than ever smiled Before in the form of a twelve years' child. Her arm about his neck entwines, That like rose-tinted ivory shines. He looks up in her face of light, The flood of her curls half blinds his sight; And, sportive as a chasing wind, Her fingers play with his locks behind. With a ripple and gurgle the waters flash Around his light, translucent knees; He strides with as bold an air and dash As did Balboa in the western main, Bearing the imagined form of Spain To enthrone her on the seas. So, my beautiful boy, with triumphant smile, Enthrones his queen on the flowering isle, And then withdraws to a rock which stands A little above the flooded sands, And sits thereon with entrancÃ©d look; Then from his breast his companion-book With ecstatic hand he gayly draws, And, without further thought or pause, With charmÃªd pencil begins to impart What he sees so well with eye and heart; For his soul is full of the love of art, And his youthful hand has long been skilled In picturing what his fancy willed, Till far and near, with pride and joy, All speak of the marvellous village boy. From either slant bank overhead The great trees lean till their boughs are wed; Where the little birds chase in and out, Singing in their May-day rout. The kingfisher sails down, and there The long crane lights, and, with sidelong stare, Seems to the beautiful lovers to say, âYou're intruding, you know, but are welcome to stay.â The drawing is finished, he strides to the isle, And lowly sits at the maiden's feet, And shows her the picture; with blush and smile She praises the effort in accents sweet. Great praise, though spoke by a queen aloud, Ne'er made young Raphael feel more proud. But look! o'er the fall see the angler stand, Swinging his rod with skilful hand; The fly at the end of his gossamer line Swims through the sun like a summer moth, Till dropt with a careful precision fine, It touches the pool beyond the froth. A-sudden, the speckled hawk of the brook Darts from his covert and seizes the hook; Swift spins the reel; with easy slip The line pays out, and the rod like a whip, Lithe and arrowy, tapering, slim, Is bent to a bow o'er the brooklet's brim, Till the trout leaps up in the sun, and flings The spray from the flash of his finny wings, Then falls on his side, and, drunken with fright, Is towed to the shore like a staggering barge, Till beached at last on the sandy marge, Where he dies with the hues of the morning light, While his sides with a cluster of stars are bright. The angler in his basket lays The constellation, and goes his ways. Ah, my sweet Ralph and Rosalie, I would not mar your morning dream By hinting at sadder things that be; Of that solemn Angler who mournfully Wanders and waits beside Life's stream, There seeking ever the starriest prey To bear to his shadowy realms away. II. A SUMMER STORY. Mine ancient, cynical, bachelor friend, I know you sneer at this my song, At school-time loves, that only belong To âchildren,â a thing you don't comprehend; And yet I know you've a great large heart. In common parlance, a very âbarnâ! I warn you (bards have the right to warn), Your crops are all garnered, and every part Is crowded with sultry sheaves of the past, And you have gathered your best and last. November is on you; just bend down your ear Above that red âbarn,â and hear what you'll hear. 'Tis the throb of life's tide, you will say, on the shore; Nay, the thump of the flail on your heart's dusty floor. Can you not remember in days long gone, When you were a school-boy, and knew not men, A beautiful face that upon you shone, As never a face has shone since then? How, like a highwayman, you lay in wait To steal one glance, or to catch one word! How your heart, like a lark, went singing elate If you caught but a smile, or a syllable heard? So sweet was her speech in its delicate closes, You thought she was made of music and roses! So, I pray you, hold off,âif you cannot, in others, Re-live what you've lost in the May that has flown: Who enjoys not their pleasures, he murderously smothers A thousand delights that might still be his own. So tend to your barn, and its sheaves, and its flail, And let the muse freely keep on with her tale. My beautiful Ralph and Rosalie, The years are reeling through space, you know, Three times you have seen the lilacs blow, Since that sweet brooklet revelry. Eighteen and fifteen are beautiful ages, The loveliest figures on Life's young pages; But the volume holds threescore, or so, And every twelvemonth a leaf must be turned, And its mystical lesson sincerely learned. The round years roll; they are worlds in themselves, And spin on their axis, every one, And eternity is their central sun, While we, poor, miserable, helpless elves, Must whirl with their whirling night and day, Till our eyes are dim, and our hair is blown gray. Oh, my beloved and beautiful two, You know not what is in store for you; It never troubles your innocent wits; You only see what is bright and new, And glorify all with your heart's own dew; From flower to flower your butterfly flits, Your great bee drops On the clover-tops, And drinks at his leisure the honey-dew. 'Tis a breathless day; the laden grove Is dreaming its summer dream of love; A murmurous whisper, like a school, Is stealing along through its shadows cool; And you thoughtfully wonder, so still is the air, What it is that's astir in the tree-tops there. I have a belief, and no reasoning clod, With his facts driven in and clinched with a nod, Shall argue me out of my poet faithâ My heart holds fast to what Nature saith. I inherit some of that ancient creed, From which the world has long been freed,â Freed, and made better; but, in felling the tree Of Error, such accident well might be; They may have crushed some flowers of truth, The fairest that blest the world in its youth. I believe that every created thing Hath a soul which was born in Eternity's spring, Which still will live on to Eternity's close, Though the world end in fire, as prophecy shows; So these great forest souls, holding council together, May converse as they please in the calmest of weather. In low, mellow tones they are breathing to-day,â I wish I could know what these woodland bards say; But I'm sure they are talking of him and of her Whose feet 'mid the leaves make a musical stir, Where they go hand and hand, with singing and laughter, The red thrush before, and the gray squirrel after. Through paths where the whortle-berries grow, And where the woodland blossoms blow, They find the honeysuckle fruit Delicious, and only grown to suit The delicate taste of a maid like ours, Whose whole sweet life seems formed of flowers. Where the odorous mandrake lies around, Dragging the thin stalk to the ground, Not to be touched till a golden yellow Proclaims them mature, and pulpy, and mellow. They pass, till they gain a May-time knoll, Only wanting the flowery pole. Here the vine, in ambitious reach, Climbs to the top of the oak and beech, O'erflowing the trees, as fountains their urns, Till the gazer scarce their support discerns, And drops its cordage, in many a loop, Like ropes on the summer deck of a sloop. Between the trees one great vine clings, The very completest of woodland swings, And into the swing my Rosalie Is lifted, and seated, and there swings she, Pouring her full heart's rapturous glee; While Ralph, with his soul brimming o'er with devotion, Keeps the vine with its beautiful freight in full motion, Till, seizing the swing, he runs daringly under, And impels her so high that, in fear and in wonder, Her breathing is stayed, while her delicate tresses Are smoothed forth and back by the soft wind's caresses. My beautiful Ralph and Rosalie, The clusters are thick on life's young bough, And they on the red autumnal tree May ripen to purple and gold, and be All that they promise the future now; But oftentimes o'er the full vine blows A poisonous breath, and no one knows From whence it comes or whither it goes; But the fairest clusters that crown the vine Are suddenly seen to wither and pine; Or the grape to its central seed is cleft, Like a broken heart by hope bereft. But never let thoughts like these arise, Dear flower, to dim your violet eyes; Let sadness come in its own time brought; Let unfound sorrow still lie unsought. Then swing and sing, sweet maiden mine. A bluebird on a summer vine; An embodied April, May, and June, Overflowing with spring-time tune; A soul of blooms, where the song of birds Finds sweet translation in musical words. But, hark! a shudder runs through the air. As if, within his desert lair, Some lion, shaking the sleep from his mane, Proclaimed himself lord of the boundless plain, With savage growl, and hungry grumble; But as it nears 'tis the rattle and rumble Of a chariot making its way toward Rome, Bearing victorious CÃ¦sar home. But see! to the harnessed winds is given The tempest car, with its fiery levin, And these are the thunder-wheels of Heaven, Over the distant hill-tops driven; Already the tremulous heads of the trees Are bowing before the courier breeze, But the insolent outriders soon rush past, Whirling and snapping the whips of the blast, Lashing and cutting the boughs, till the air Is alive with the foliage that flies in despair; And suddenly frighting the harvesting world, The roaring cloud o'er the sun is hurled, With the speed of a death-laden warrior barque, While the red lightnings flash from its ports through the dark. Near by there is a shelter of rocks, Where a shepherdess might watch her flocks, Secure as well from shower and sun, With mosses and wild vines over-run. Scenting the rain ere the big drops splash, Listening to the rending crash, And blinded by the sulphurous flash, To this woodland cloister the lovers withdraw, With a mingled sense of pleasure and awe; But not too soon, for a bolt of fire. By the storm-king sped, in reckless ire, From his red right hand in a blazing line, Shivers the oak with its loaded vine; And they see, when the stun of the blow is past, The tree and the swing, Each a splintered thing, Over the knoll in confusion cast. Now and then they hear the sound Of large drops on their sentinel round, For the main great army of the rain Has followed the stream up the distant plain, To entrench its full force in the strength of the hills, The better to raid on the valleys and mills: And that splashy tread is of picket or scout, Which the storm, on his flank, has thrown warily out. The skirmishers now have passed from view; Come, stroll to the headland, my beautiful two; What is the walk of a mile to you? And see how the wind has worried the bay, Till it flung its insult of flashing spray Into the face of the blast, Half blinding it with brine as it passed. You are not one to be afraid, So fear not for your feet, sweet maid; Only a little spot of wet Lies here and there like a violet. Along the path, under barberry bushes, And where your hand the low bough pushes Aside, perchance your golden curl May catch in its snare a random pearl, And the branch, if your touch be somewhat reckless, Rebounding, may fling you a delicate necklace. But this is all: to the headland hie, And watch the ships and the storm go by. They are out on their way, through bush and through bramble, Where the rabbits all year in security gambol; There the snowy skirt of my Rosalie's dress Is caught in the barbarous vines' caress, Like Innocence, by the world beset, Till it struggles out of the briery net; But the fingers of Ralph will dexterous be In freeing her pathway; and what cares he If the thorns do wound him? he laughs at the pain, And brushes away the crimson stain; For his hand, though no complaint is said, Like a tiger-lily, is speckled with red. But out of the thicket they laughing emerge, And stand at last on the ocean's verge. The rebel storm is subdued and bowed, And the seven-hued banner is hung on the cloud, And the air is flooded with purple and gold, Out of the royal sun's tent rolled. From billows that round the dark rocks whirl, Is thrown their spray of amber and pearl; The dashing brine, and the new-mown hay, Send mingled odors around the bay. The flowers on shore, and the breakers' white bloom, Have each their own beauty of hue and perfume. The hidden thrush fills the air with delight, While the grace of the sea-bird is flashed on the sight. In midst of the waves, like a swinging gull, To the billows a plaything, the fisherman's hull Is lifted and dropt o'er the watery realm; But the hand of the master is firm at the helm, While the larger barque speeds through the foam of the main, Like a cantering steed o'er a flowery plain. See yon great dusky steamer: it comes from the isles Where the sea-birds of Commerce, in cormorant flocks, Sail in and sail out round the fog-mantled rocks, Where the cloud seldom lifts, and the sun seldom smiles. On its briny deck perchance is borne Great news, that by to-morrow's morn May wake our land, and let it know That family blood, though it may flow Thousands of miles away o'er the main, Is not perforce our natural foe, Taking delight in its kindred's pain; Or it may tell of the hungry growl Of the jealous sea-lion; well, let him howl. The bird that sits on our cliffs by the sea Is as wakeful and watchful a guardian as he; The time will come, when, through natural laws, The teeth will be lost from his leonine jaws; Then the king in his lair, In the depth of his dotage, as well as despair, With his head dropped over his powerless paws, Will feel the hoof and hear the bray Of the smallest power he awes to-day. In that hour, forgetting injustice uncivil, His menacing stand, and his great exultation, When destruction was waving her torch o'er our nation; Then we, ere he sinks to his ruinous level, Ere his great mart becomes the sacked Rome of the sea, An embryo Nineveh yet to be, In magnanimous might may return good for evil, And drive the foul robbers, who now are his slaves, From the island made dear by our ancestors' graves. Here, in the bay, lies a Union ship, Which the billow scarce causes to rise or to dip, So grandly she looms, lying under the fort, And so heavy the war-dog that snarls at each port. A thousand defenders like this, huge and grim, On the watery highway in triumph shall swim, 'Twixt opposite poles, e'en from ice unto ice, And the world will take heed of their iron advice, And a continent yet, of Columbia's sons, Shall delight in the voice of those Union guns. My beautiful Ralph and Rosalie, We are not talking of love, you see. In the hour of ruder things, Sometimes Love must draw apart Into some recess of the heart, And fold himself in his own bright wings, Lest by a sudden whirl and gust In the highway of life the clinging dust Might soil those pinions' celestial hue, Which, tarnished, no power on earth can renew. But I hear my trusting young Rosalie say, With a shake of her curls, her protest sweet: She believes that Love, in the roughest highway, Would sanctify all with his delicate feet; That the weariest road where his wings unfold Is suddenly paved with amber and gold, And thickly strewn through the sultriest hours With roses, and cooled with the dew of flowers! A beautiful faith, gentle priestess, in sooth, To breathe at the garlanded altar of youth, From which flows the crystalline fountain of Truth; And you, standing so near, May see and may hear What the time-veiled sense of the eye and the ear Of the world-weary pilgrim might fail to make clear. On this bowery headland an altar stands, Carved from the granite by invisible hands, When the world was young, And there the old loomsman, Time, has flung A mantle across, Made of the delicate many-hued moss, And here, with the rainbow arching above, Making a dome to their temple of Love; With listening wild flowers, and with witnessing sun, While the sudden gush of the woodland throng Rises like a hymeneal song; And along the rocks the swift waves run, Like the hands of an organist, flashing free, With inspiration, from key to key, Sending jubilant melody up from the sea. Here sitting, the hearts of my beautiful two, Like long-watched flowers, that blossom at last, Aflush with beauty, and bright with dew, Swelling with all the dear growth of the past, With a glory no time can destroy or conceal, Bloom full in the light of each other's eyes! Their two souls look their glad surprise, And the depth of their deathless love reveal; And wonder smiles in the face of each, That what has been growing so long and well Should only this moment have broken the spell, And found expression in tremulous speech. Sweet words are said, and sweeter replies Come on the breath of responsive sighs, And melt through the tear, which the soft lash keeps, That earliest drop which the full heart weeps, Born of the ecstasy which it feels When Love at his first confessional kneels. Oh, Love, let never foot more rude Than yours on this sainted place intrude; Let a hallowed glory forever shine Around this consecrated shrine; Breathe you a ban on the ambient air, To admit no wing but the singer's there; And draw a circle around the spot, That nothing less pure than the violet, The sweet-brier, and the forget-me-not, Shall near this sacred shrine be set; Let naught unholy be seen or heard At the altar where you have ministered. III. A SUMMER STORY. My beautiful Ralph and Rosalie, There is tumult in your leafy town; A tumult, swinging like waves of the sea, For the swift winds of Rumor thereon have blown, And the spray of its startled wrath is thrown Back to the threatening thunder-wrack, Looming to southward, heavy and black. The very bells o'er this turbulent ocean Have caught the tempest's billowy motion, Like storm-bells rocking to and fro, Rung by the passionate waves below; Even those in their Sabbath towers, Only meant for prayer-time hours, Or bridal scenes, or measured calls To slow and solemn funerals, With unrestrained and fiery clangor Ring out their fierce indignant anger, As might some priest, who long had given The guiding words that lead to Heaven, Proclaim, with his denouncing tongue, The fiercest sentence ever flung At the iconoclastic band; Should he behold the fiendish frown, And see the demon-lighted eye, And hear the desecrating cry Of one who strove, with lifted hand, To strike his dearest image down. Speak out, wild bells, with swifter swing! Ye patriot hearts of iron mould, Ye men, whom danger never a wed; Whose courage hath the old-time ring, This is no hour to stand and hark! The black, unnatural deed is done; The traitor, springing from the dark, Would tear the stars from yonder fold, And mar the flag your fathers won! The braggart, courting new disgrace, Has flung his glove into the faceâ The sainted faceâof Washington. Let every tongue in anger swing The anathematizing word abroad, Even though revenge should fiercely wing The fiery arrows of your wrath, To stay the traitor in his path: The angel Freedom, sitting near to God, Whose tearful eyes her anxious soul betray, Will look into His face and plead the sin away. The town is full of fifes and drums; From every home a patriot comes; You can hear them shouting on every hill, Like spring-time brooks, with resistless will, Swelling the sea on Freedom's coast, To o'erthrow and drown the insolent host. The yeoman, who knows to hew and delve, Driving the axe or the spade to its helve, Now bears the gun that his father bore By the side of Scott in the âWar of Twelve;â Or the glorious sword his grandsire wore; The flash of whose good steel still predicts Defeat to the foe, as in âseventy-six.â All ranks of life, the desk and plough, Send out their teeming legions now. Those patriots old, when their wars were done, And they hung on the wall the sword and gun, Ne'er dreamed what future treasonous breath, Breathed from the hot plains of the South, Out of the stolen cannon's mouth, Threat'ning Freedom with sudden death, Should call those sacred weapons forth From the cottage wall, Or ancestral hall, To fields that fester beneath the sun, In defence of Liberty and the North,â The North and Liberty being one. On every homestead, on every church, Our eagle banner is seen to perch, Where it shines like Heaven's approving mark A covenant over our Union ark. My beautiful Ralph and Rosalie, There's a glorious sight for you to see; And could I picture the vision of gold, The wondrous pile, so high and broad, Aflush with the eternal light of God, And full of His harmonies manifoldâ Your faces, illumined, would glow and shine Like those of the souls who have just had birth, Out of the shadowy vale of earth, When first they see the celestial shrine. I behold an organ, tall and vast, The labor of all the ages past, Nor yet complete, but the golden ore Is being wrought for one note more. Its six-and-thirty great golden pipes Are draped about with stars and stripes, And on its tallest pinnacle height Our guardian eagle sits throned in light. Its fluted form o'ertops the cloud; It covers the land between the seas; While an angel, greater than prophet e'er saw, Flashes his hands along the keys, Holding the world with his symphonies, A wonderful music, deep and loud, Filling the nations with marvelling awe. But see, the angel recoils apace, With wonder and wrath on his startled face, For a fiend, with a fierce and murderous mien, Has stolen suddenly in unseen, And, with a mingled rage and glee, Is dashing his madness from key to key, Making horrible discord down the bass; And as from the jargon a maniac mutters, May be gathered some clue to his fell disease, Thus, from the jar of those tortured keys, I catch the meaning he wildly utters:â âDown, down with the pile the patriots built, That stands a rebuke to our Southern guilt! Down, down, though humanity quakes at the jar, Shuddering to see our sword red to the hilt, While a race, half our own, drags our Juggernaut car!â But the angel, for whom the great organ was made, With a glorious anger, that cannot be stayed, Strikes the clear silver notes of the octaves above, That leap to the mountains, and pierce to the grove, And thrill through the cities, and startle the farms, Till the North is all lit with the flashing of arms. And still, as he plays, the other recoils, Relinquishing keys that his touching but spoils, Till on his last octaves, with rage and affright, He franticly strikes a wild maniac blow. Then flies, with a shriek, to his own native night, The realm of the king of all traitors below. A new the great Union organ awakes, And the grand anthem swings from the Gulf to the Lakes, Announcing the stigma that darkened our land Is swept at the waving of Liberty's hand. Still, still may that music go widely abroad, Proclaiming our realm is the chosen of God. The world is all joy, my Rosalie, And yet one pleasure remains for me:â In this cathedral land of ours, Whose aisles are strewn with Union flowers, The glorious red, and white, and blue, While that wonderful organ, from lofty towers, Is pouring its jubilant notes anew, Come, kneel at the altar, and over you And your soldier, with his empty sleeve, And his crutch, which makes you proud, not grieve, The sounds shall fall in hymeneal showers, Blessing the joining of heart and hand, In a land united at God's command. MISCELLANEOUS. THE BLESSED DEAD. Oh, happy childhood! tender buds of spring Touched in the May-time by a wandering frost; Ye have escaped the summer's sultry wing: No drought hath parched you, and no wind hath tossed, Shaking the pearls of morning from your breast: Ye have been gathered ere your sweets were lost, Ere wingÃ©d passions stole into your rest To rob the heart of all its dewy store. Now in the endless May-time overhead, In starry gardens of the azure shore, Ye bloom in light, and are for evermore The blessed dead. Ye youths and maidens, dear to Joy and Love, But fallen midway between morn and noon,â Or bird-like flown, as if some longing dove Should seek a better clime while yet 'tis June, Leaving our fields forlorn! Oh, happy flight! Gone while your hearts are full of summer tune And ignorant of the autumnal blight,â Ere yet a leaf hath withered on the bough Or innocent rose hath drooped its dying head; Gone with the virgin lilies on your brow, Ye, singing in immortal youth, are now The blessed dead. And ye, who in the harvest of your years Were stricken when the sun was in mid-air, And left the earth bedewed at noon with tears,â Ye have known all of life that is most fair, The laugh of April, and the summer bloom. Ye with the orange-blossoms in your hair, Who sleep in bridal chambers of the tomb; Or ye, who with the sickle in the hand Have bowed amid the sheaves the manly head, And left the toil unto a mournful band,â Ye all are numbered in yon resting land, The blessed dead. And ye, who like the stately upland oak Breasted the full allotted storms of time, And took new strength from every gusty stroke,â And ye, who like a vine long taught to climb And weigh its native branches with ripe fruit,â Much have ye suffered 'neath the frosty rime Which autumn brings, and winter's loud dispute! But now, transplanted in the fields afar, Your age is like a withered foliage shed,â And where Youth's fountain sparkles like a star, This have ye learned, they only live who are The blessed dead. THE PHANTOM LEADERS. By starlight they rode in their speed and their might, A warrior-host sweeping down through the night,â An army of spectres, they sped on the wind, With swords piercing front and plumes streaming behind; On the highways of air they were led as by Mars, While their steeds shod with thunder seemed trampling the stars! Like a fleet in a gale, they careered through the night, And the path where they passed flashed with phosphorous light. In the front galloped Brutus, a foe to all peace, His blade gleaming red with the blood of Lucrece; And, turning toward Rome, bent his way down the heaven, Repeating the oath which of old he had given. âThese modern Tarquins must fall!â was his cry; âBy the blade of their own bloody guilt they shall die!â And, strange though it be, there Mohammed was seen, His Arab's mane sweeping his mantle of green, And the watchwords engraved on his drawn scimitar Were âAllah, il Allah!â each letter a star. Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden was there, As at LÃ¼tzen he rode with his battle-blade bare. And, like their own turbulent torrents let loose By a storm in the Highlands, sped Wallace and Bruce. Sobieski, the Pole, gave his charger the rein, Every stroke of whose hoof broke a fetter in twain. There was Olaf of Norway, whose mandate and sword The heathen struck down in the name of the Lord. There sped fiery Tell with his cross-bow and dart, The barb glowing crimson from Gessler's proud heart. And close by his side, the beloved of his peers, Bold Winkelried rode with his arms full of spears, The same old self-sacrifice lighting his eye, And âMake way for Liberty!â still was his cry. There was Luther, no braver e'er rode to the field, And the word of the Lord was his buckler and shield, While the weapon he grasped was the same he had sped In a moment of anger at Lucifer's head. There was Cromwell, that monarch who never wore crown, With his Bible and sword and his Puritan frown, And with him Charles-Albert, the Piedmontese star, As he rode ere betrayed on the field of Novarre. There, with garments still red from that last fatal day, The ghost of Bozzaris sped fierce for the fray; And close by his side, with an eye full of fire, Rode Byron, still grasping his sword and his lyre, And the war-kindling numbers which fell from his tongue Like the notes of a wild battle-clarion were flung! And just in advance galloped KÃ¶rner and Burns, Unsheathing the war-song and falchion by turns! There, gazing and listening, my spirit entranced Leaped for joy as these poets for Freedom advanced; And I felt the warm thought through my bosom descend, That the bard to be true must be Liberty's friend! Then came a dim host to my vision unknown, Like those lights which astronomers number alone; But their voice still made clear what the eye could not see, Crying, âDown with the tyrant, wherever he be!â But why swept these phantoms? Whence rode they, and where? What occasion had summoned these allies of air? I looked, and beheld the swift spread of the blaze Which dazzled the stars with the pulse of its rays, As if through the darkness the lightning had played, And in midst of its splendor been suddenly stayed: There I read the great words spread like fiery wings Where âweighed and found wantingâ confronted the kings! And this army of spectres, led on by that light, Like a cloud on a hurricane swept through the night; And this was their cry coming down on the gale, âThe modern Belshazzars are weighed in the scale!â A BIRTHDAY THOUGHT IN ITALY. INSCRIBED TO MISS S. R. B. As once the trembling Lombard saw The swift barbarians' line of spears Wind down the Alps, thus here in awe I watch the approaching line of years. They come, the Goth and Vandal bands, With savage tread and look uncouth; With spear and mace and murderous brands, They file toward the plains of youth. Down into life's Etrurian vales, O'er green campagnas broad and fair, They sweep like bitter Norland gales, And fright the calm Italian air. Their barbarous feet know no restraint; They vent their rage before our eyes: The shrine that held our dearest saint A ruined heap before us lies. The temples by our young hearts reared, Their ruffian malice batters down; Ambition's altars, unrevered, With domes of Hope, lie overthrown. And Friendship's wayside shrines and towers Too oft are shattered as they pass: Oft Love, a statue wreathed with flowers, Lies at their feet a crumbled mass. But like these pure Etruscan skies, Unsullied by the Goth's control, One fane the vandal Time defies,â The dome of sunshine in the soul! And thou, fair maid, so young and blest! When impious years shall touch thy brow, Still hold this sunshine in thy breast, And be as beautiful as now. Bagni di Lucca, August 16, 1855. THE STAYED CURSE. With face half hidden in ungathered hair, Which fell like sunshine o'er her shoulders bare, She leaned her cheek against her chamber wall, As if to note when some far voice should call. Her weary soul stood at its prison bars, Fainting to hear a summons from the stars. For life was now a midnight wilderness, Wherein none whispered peace to her distress, Save One, whose voice, of love and pity blended, 'Mid her loud grief was not yet comprehended. She heard alone the vulture sailing by, Led by the foulest birds of calumny; Felt the cold serpents crawl against her feet, And saw the gaunt wolves steal to her retreat. The wide world scowled and reddened at her shame, Scorching her soul with horror; and her name Was struck, as with the violent hand of rage, With one huge blot from off the social page. What wonder that the soul thus rudely wrung Should shape such words as half appalled the tongue! Words like fierce arrows for the faithless breast Where love had dreamed with too confiding rest; Shafts which, once sped at random from the lips, Some friendly fiend must guide to their eclipse In the dark heart, where, on his starless throne, Deception sat, and, smiling, reigned alone! Thus had she nursed her grief for many days, And thus the curse was struggling from her breast, When, as the midnight's solemn sentry bell Struck vaguely through her woe-engendered haze, Announcing, as it were, the mournful guest, She heard the sudden close of wings which fell, Together with the rustling sound of sighs; And presently, uplifting her blank eyes, Beheld a dull and ashen form of woe Stand looking its great melancholy there, As if long years of under-world despair Had fanned him with the hottest airs that blow Athwart the fierce Sahara fields below! The wings were leaden-hued and ruffled all, As if long beaten 'gainst some stormy wall, Or blown contrary by belligerent gusts, Then trailed for ages through the cinder dusts On plains adjacent, where the Stygian pours, Hissing forever on volcanic shores! She looked, and on her lips the curse was stayed! Thrice all the vengeance which her soul had planned Burned on the forehead of the fallen shade! Her purpose droptâas from the archer's hand Might fall the arrow if he saw the foe Struck by the lightning's swift and surer blow! The curse was stayedâshe looked to heaven and sighed, âForgive! forgive!â and in her prayer she died! TWENTY-ONE. SOME BIRTHDAY LINES TO J. R. T. Far within the orient azure, In the purple and the dew, Lies the flowery land of pleasure Which your early childhood knew. In its dim and blue existence There it lies, a dewy space, In the bright forbidden distance Memory only can retrace. After this the fancy wanders Over varied field and hill, Where the swelling stream meanders And forgets it was a rill. Many a flower with odors baneful Blooms enticingly thereby, To whose influence, subtle, painful, Later years shall testify. In Youth's lovely, dangerous valley, E'en the best-directed feet Oft may turn to stray and dally 'Mid the bowers that chill and cheat. But anon the flowers grow scanter And to rougher pastures yield, Where the ploughman and the planter Must prepare the harvest-field. On that boundary you are standing, 'Twixt the blossoms and the clods, To begin on this stern landing The great strife gainst fearful odds. Where you strolled the sunny meadows, You must brave the rocks and storms; Where you took alarm at shadows, You must combat solid forms. Hills of snow and valleys torrid Lie beyond the boundary vast, Where fond Life with anxious forehead Reads the future from the past. Huge and rough as thunder-smitten, Rise the barriers of the gate, With one sentence overwritten,â Simple letters full of fate. On the arch through which you're speeding There those two forbidding words Still shall flame, as over Eden Blazed the red exiling swords. A lost realm recovered neverâ With receding speed increased, Barred and branded there forever It shall glimmer in the east. Youth is goneâa vanished gloryâ And, with stern and earnest view, Manhood needs take up the story, And with valor bear it through. All the world lies wide before you, Where to choose the wrong or right; And no future shall restore you What you seize not now with might. Let each act be the sure token Of the nobler life ahead:â Let each thought in truth be spoken, Though the utterance strike you dead. Spurn the small enticing by-way Where Temptation sits apart: Boldly tread the open highway Leading to the golden mart. Though the world smile on you blandly, Let your friends be choice and few; Choose your course, pursue it grandly, And achieve what you pursue! BEATRICE. Though others know thee by a fonder name, I, in my heart, have christened thee anew; And though thy beauty, in its native hue (Shedding the radiance of whence it came), May not bequeath to language its high claim,â Thy smiling presence, like an angel's wing, Fans all my soul of poesy to flame,â Till, even in remembering, I must sing. Such led the grand old Tuscan's longing eyes Through all the crystal rounds of Paradise; And, in my spirit's farthest journeying, Thy smile of courage leads me up the skies, Through realms of song, of beauty, and of bliss,â And therefore have I named thee Beatrice! HERO AND LEANDER. Long had they dwelt within one breathless cell, Two souls, by some mad Sycorax confined; But, oh! the unmeant mercy of that spell Which turned those arms to marble, while entwined In all the passionate woe of tenderness, And to the unknown depths of earth consigned These radiant forms of Beauty's rare excess, This monument of Love's own loveliness! Unchronicled, the centuries rolled on. And groves grew ancient on the prison-hill; And men forgot their parent tongues anon, And spoke a different language, as a rill Wearing another channel from its source, Makes a new song accordant with its course. But suddenly the unexpectant sun Beheld the swarthy laborers employ Upon that hill their rude exhuming art, Like shadowy hopes at some dull, ancient heart To free the spirit of long-buried joy. And now they grappled with the stubborn rocks, Breaking the antique seals which time had set Upon the earth's deep treasury, that locks Within its inmost wards such marts as yet The busy masons of the poet's brain Have builded not. Anon the toiling ox Dragged the white quarry to the peopled plain, And Beauty's soul lay sepulchred unknown! The crowd discerned it not, till there came one Who heard the passionate breathings in the stone, The wordless music of Love's overflow; Who heard and pitied, and, like Prospero, Released the spirits from their living grave; And when the breathless world beheld themâlo! The soul of purity, around, above, Hung in the tremulous air like heaven's own dove; And Fame pronounced the name of him who gave A marble immortality to Love! WINTER. Lo, Winter comes, and all his heralds blow Their gusty trumpets, and his tents of snow Usurp the fields from whence sad Autumn flies,â Autumn, that finds a southern clime or dies. The streams are dumb with woe; the forest grieves, Wailing the loss of all its summer leaves: As some fond Rachel on her childless breast Clasps her thin hands where once her young were prest Then flings her empty arms into the air, And swells the gale with her convulsed despair! THE BLIGHTED FLOWER. Why, gentle lady, why complain At Scandal's ever-flying breath? 'Gainst Virtue's cheek it blows in vain, And thereon breathes itself to death. The flower beneath the passing rain, Untouched of canker or of blight, Bows patiently, to rise again With sweeter breath and fresher light. But if the worm be hid beneath, Or haply if the hot simoom, Like some unlawful lover's breath, Hath wooed that blossom to its doom,â Then, woe is me, how poor and frail Is Beauty in her fairest form! Her brightness cannot stay the gale, Her perfume cannot charm the storm. But when the searching wind comes by, And shakes each blossom by the stalk, The tainted leaves asunder fly, To wither down the garden walk;â And ere one heated noon has sped, They crisp and curl and pass from sight, Or crumble 'neath some careless tread As if they never had been bright. THE DEATH OF THE VETERAN. AN INCIDENT DURING THE MEXICAN WAR. INSCRIBED TO MAJOR ANDERSON, OF THE U. S. ARMY. Since last we met, a throng has joined The army of the years, Trampling to dust our summer flowers, Like conquering cavaliers. Since last we met!âIn those few words There is a mournful beat, Like throbbing of a muffled drum, Or tread of funeral feet. Since then, in war's high festival You've waved the clashing sword,â While I have been a saddened guest At Life's promiscuous board. Since then, the young with mimic arms Have grown to armÃ©d men; And they may wear the veteran's hair Before we meet again:â Or though, ere that, our mighty Chief Should grant our last release, And Death conduct us to the camp, The far white camp of Peace,â Yet here, in memory of those days, Still cherished, though long spent, I wake the martial harp before The doorway of your tent. From hill to hill the âgood newsâ ran As swift as signal fires; From shore to sea, from gulf to land, And flashed along the wires: And presently from wharf to wharf The cannons made reply, And in the city's crowded streets Was heard the newsman's cry. Bright grew the matron's face when I The victory began; Pale waxed the young wife's cheek when she Heard who had led the van; And, struggling with the mists of age Which veiled his eye and ear, The grandsire raised his palsied hand And feebly strove to hear. And when I read the story, how Amid the flying balls The brave lieutenant bore the flag And scaled the shattered walls, The matron and the young wife stood Too terrified for tears, While flamed the old man's cheek with red It had not known for years. But when I read, that as the flag In triumph o'er him flew, How twenty bullets hewed his breast And cleaved it through and through,â The mother heaved a short, deep groan, And sunk into her chair; The wife fell on the matron's breast, And swooned in her despair. And like a wounded, dying stag, Lodged in some old retreat, That hears the still approaching hounds And staggers to his feet,â The Veteran struggled from his chair And raised himself upright,â His eye a moment kindled with Its long-forgotten light;â So firm he strode across the room, So martial was his air, You scarce had guessed that ninety years Had whitened through his hair:â Then from the wainscot took his sword, Where it had hung so long, Memorial of many a field, The weak against the strong,â Of fields where Justice armed the few With consecrated brands, And lodged a nation's destiny In their devoted hands:â And, gazing on the blade, he said, âThou art as keen and bright As when in those old trying times We battled for the right: âAs when we wintered in the snow Within the frozen gorge, And from our starving ranks still hurled Defiance at King George: âAs when beside the Brandywine We fought the whole day through, Till fields had changed their mantle And the river changed its hue: âAs when 'mid grinding gulfs of ice, Upon a Christmas night, We crossed the roaring Delaware And put the foe to flight! âIt may be this old arm of mine Is not as steady now As when it drew against Burgoyne, Or cleaved the ranks of Howe; âThe hand may tremble on the hilt, The heart within is strong; And God who strengthened once the right Will not uphold the wrong. âWhat! have they ta'en the last support That propped my honored wall? Shall the name become tradition And the stately roof-tree fall? âWas't not enough that he who, through The woods and tangled brakes, Spread terror o'er the savage, from The Gulf unto the Lakes; âAnd who beside the bloody Thames Left death where'er he sped, Till the fate which he was hurling round Recoiled upon his head,â âWas't not enough? Speak thou, my friend: Old comrade, thou wert there,â Who in the days aforetime drove The Lion to his lair; âTwice drove him from our shore, and chased The red wolf to his den! Was't not enough, but must I hear The death-note sound again? âAnd has our banner waved abroad, The martial trumpet pealed, And foemen bristled on the plain, And we not in the field? âOld sword, in this our winter, Shall they call to us in vain, Who reaped the crimson harvest With a Washington and Wayne? âNo! come, my trusty champion, Till the field be cleared and won, And the foe be left in prostrate ranks To bleach beneath the sun! âHo! now is't blood which stains you, Or the shameful blush of rust? Is it age which dims my vision, Or the flying smoke and dust? âIs't the beating of my heart I hear, Or calling drum at hand? Or grows my step unsteady, Or does battle shake the land? âThe drums grow loud and louder, With the bugle's dreadful note; The smoke-wreaths thicken round me, And the dust is in my throat! âHark, hark! I hear the order, and It bids me mount the wall; I know the General's voice!âand I Obey him though I fall! âYes, I will plant my country's flag Upon the topmost stone; For when her fate demands it, What should I care for my own? âNow how the loud walls totter, Thicker.âdarker grows the smoke,â And all the air is turned to dust,â I stumble, and I choke! âOne solid thrust to plant the staff,â There!âlet the eagle soar!â He cried, and, reeling, clasped his breast,â He fellâand breathed no more! EVENING IN WINTER. Robed like an abbess The snowy earth lies, While the red sundown Fades out of the skies. Up walks the evening, Veiled like a nun, Telling her starry beads One by one. Where like the billows The shadowy hills lie, Like a mast the great pine swings Against the bright sky. Down in the valley The distant lights quiver, Gilding the hard-frozen Face of the river. When o'er the hill-tops The moon pours her ray, Like shadows the skaters Skirr wildly away; Whirling and gliding, Like summer-clouds fleet, They flash the white lightning From glittering feet. The icicles hang On the front of the falls, Like mute horns of silver On shadowy walls; Horns that the wild huntsman Spring shall awake, Down flinging the loud blast Toward river and lake! A PLEA FOR THE HOMELESS. A cry goes up amidst a prosperous nation, And Hunger begs within a plenteous land! Have ye not heard the voice of Desolation? Have ye not seen the stretched and famished hand? Have ye not felt the solemn obligation To rise, and straightway answer the demand? O happy mothers, in your homes protected, Whose little ones may never ask for alms, That voice is Childhood's! starving and neglected Pale Infancy implores with empty palms,â The sad soul sitting in its eyes dejected, No voice elates, no smile of pity calms. Let those dear looks, so full of April splendor, Those dimpled hands you clasp within your own, That voice you love so, plead with accents tender For those who weep unguarded and alone, For those dull eyes, those hands so weak and slender, Those pallid lips, whose mirth is but a moan! Sweet plants there are which bloom in sultry places, By rude feet trampled in their early hour, Which, when transplanted, are so full of graces, They lend a charm to Flora's fairest bower: O ye who pass, look down into their faces, Displace the dust, and recognize the flower! Lo, the example for our guidance given,â In sacred light our duty stands revealed! For One there was, who, in His great love, even Noted the smallest lilies of the field, And, blessing children, said, âOf such is heaven!â His âSuffer them to come,â stands unrepealed! O ye whose hearts, amid the worldly noises, No cares can harden, and no self benumb, Whose ears are open to these orphan voices, Whose answering soul no avarice makes dumb, The great Recorder o'er your names rejoices, For ye have truly suffered them to come! THE CELESTIAL ARMY. I stood by the open casement And looked upon the night, And saw the westward-going stars Pass slowly out of sight. Slowly the bright procession Went down the gleaming arch, And my soul discerned the music Of their long triumphal march; Till the great celestial army, Stretching far beyond the poles, Became the eternal symbol Of the mighty march of souls. Onward, forever onward, Red Mars led down his clan; And the Moon, like a mailÃ©d maiden, Was riding in the van. And some were bright in beauty, And some were faint and small, But these might be in their great height The noblest of them all. Downward, forever downward, Behind Earth's dusky shore They passed into the unknown night, They passed, and were no more. No more! Oh, say not so! And downward is not just; For the sight is weak and the sense is dim That looks through heated dust. The stars and the mailÃ©d moon, Though they seem to fall and die. Still sweep with their embattled lines An endless reach of sky. And though the hills of Death May hide the bright array, The marshalled brotherhood of souls Still keeps its upward way. Upward, forever upward, I see their march sublime, And hear the glorious music Of the conquerors of Time. And long let me remember That the palest, fainting one May to diviner vision be A bright and blazing sun. CHURCH'S âHEART OF THE ANDES.â Traverse the oceans, seek for unknown strands; With great explorers ride through marvellous lands; Walk with the poet where his kingdom lies,â A realm of light beneath enchanted skies; Between bright islands sail the spicy seas, Beside the mighty-hearted Genoese; Conquer with Cortes the barbaric states, And pass through El Dorado's golden gates; Shout with the great Balboa and his crew, What time a new sea sparkles into view; With Ponce de Leon seek the fabled stream Through flowery valleys brighter than his dream; But never any sight of new-found land Shall equal this, where we entrancÃ©d stand, With dewy eyes and overflowing heart, Gazing from the exalted hill of Art! This is not sorrowing Italy, nor these The storied windings of the Pyrenees, Nor are yon high and trackless realms of snow The over-travelled Alps, the guideman's show! But these, in depth of equatorial green, Are the fresh Cordilleras, where between Wander bewildering rivers, dancing down Their rocky terraces of golden brown, Clapping their watery hands. About the falls The trees are wreathed like happy bacchanals. Here blooms a world that fears nor cold nor drouth, The lavish luxury of the teeming South, The carnival of summer, far and near, In lands where summer lords it all the year; And over all, his Andean front aglow, Great Chimborazo sits, his throne of snow! THE REAPER'S DREAM. The road was lone; the grass was dank With night-dews on the briery bank Whereon a weary reaper sank. His garb was old; his visage tanned; The rusty sickle in his hand Could find no work in all the land. He saw the evening's chilly star Above his native vale afar; A moment on the horizon's bar It hung, then sank, as with a sigh; And there the crescent moon went by, An empty sickle down the sky. To soothe his pain, Sleep's tender palm Laid on his brow its touch of balm; His brain received the slumb'rous calm; And soon that angel without name, Her robe a dream, her face the same, The giver of sweet visions, came. She touched his eyes; no longer sealed, They saw a troop of reapers wield Their swift blades in a ripened field. At each thrust of their snowy sleeves A thrill ran through the future sheaves, Rustling like rain on forest leaves. They were not brawny men who bowed, With harvest-voices rough and loud, But spirits, moving as a cloud. Like little lightnings in their hold, The silver sickles manifold Slid musically through the gold. Oh, bid the morning stars combine To match the chorus clear and fine That rippled lightly down the line; A cadence of celestial rhyme, The language of that cloudless clime, To which their shining hands kept time! Behind them lay the gleaming rows, Like those long clouds the sunset shows On amber meadows of repose; But, like a wind, the binders bright Soon followed in their mirthful might, And swept them into sheaves of light. Doubling the splendor of the plain, There rolled the great celestial wain, To gather in the fallen grain. Its frame was built of golden bars: Its glowing wheels were lit with stars; The royal Harvest's car of cars. The snowy yoke, that drew the load, On gleaming hoofs of silver trode; And music was its only goad. To no command of word or beck It moved, and felt no other check Than one white arm laid on the neck:â The neck, whose light was over-wound With bells of lilies, ringing round Their odors till the air was drowned: The starry foreheads meekly borne, With garlands looped from horn to horn, Shone like the many-colored morn. The field was cleared. Home went the bands, Like children, linking happy hands, While singing through their father's lands; Or, arms about each other thrown, With amber tresses backward blown, They moved as they were music's own. The vision brightening more and more, He saw the garner's glowing door, And sheaves, like sunshine, strew the floor,â The floor was jasper,âgolden flails, Swift-sailing as a whirlwind sails, Throbbed mellow music down the vales. He saw the mansion,âall repose,â Great corridors and porticos, Propped with the columns' shining rows; And these,âfor beauty was the rule,â The polished pavements, hard and cool, Redoubled, like a crystal pool. And there the odorous feast was spread; The fruity fragrance widely shed Seemed to the floating music wed. Seven angels, like the Pleiad seven, Their lips to silver clarions given, Blew welcome round the walls of heaven. In skyey garments, silky thin, The glad retainers floated in, A thousand forms, and yet no din: And from the visage of the Lord, Like splendor from the Orient poured, A smile illumined all the board. Far flew the music's circling sound, Then floated back, with soft rebound, To join, not mar, the converse round,â Sweet notes, that, melting, still increased. Such as ne'er cheered the bridal feast Of king in the enchanted East. Did any great door ope or close, It seemed the birth-time of repose; The faint sound died where it arose; And they who passed from door to door, Their soft feet on the polished floor Met their soft shadowsânothing more. Then, once again the groups were drawn Through corridors, or down the lawn, Which bloomed in beauty like a dawn. Where countless fountains leapt alway, Veiling their silver heights in spray, The choral people held their way. There, 'midst the brightest, brightly shone Dear forms he loved in years agone,â The earliest loved,âthe earliest flown. He heard a mother's sainted tongue; A sister's voice, who vanished young, While one still dearer sweetly sung! No further might the scene unfold, The gazer's voice could not withhold, The very rapture made him bold: He cried aloud, with claspÃ©d hands, âO, happy fields! O, happy bands! Who reap the never-failing lands. âO, master of these broad estates, Behold, before your very gates A worn and wanting laborer waits! Let me but toil amid your grain, Or be a gleaner on the plain, So I may leave these fields of pain! âA gleaner, I will follow far, With never look or word to mar, Behind the Harvest's yellow car; All day my hand shall constant be, And every happy eve shall see The precious burden borne to Thee!â At morn, some reapers neared the place, Strong men, whose feet recoiled apace, Then, gathering round the upturned face, They saw the lines of pain and care, Yet read in the expression there The look as of an answered prayer. DOWN TO THE DUST. A certain rich man, stern and proud, Yet, like a winter hemlock, bowed With the accumulated weight Of many snows, o'er his estate Led his fair grandchild by the hand, Showing her miles and miles of land, Meadows and forests, and fields of grain, Far as her wondering eye could strain; And all to be hers some future day; All hers! The realms which round them lay Descended were from a lofty line, Whose precious blood was wine, old wine, While others' was but water! Now Their noble tree, from root to bough, Stood hopeless of all future fruit, Save from the little orphan shoot, Lovely as ever in spring was seen Flattering a dying tree with green. âAll these broad lands are mine,â he said, Laying his hand on the grandchild's head, âAnd shall be yours, all yours, one day; One day, but that is far away. In heavy coffers, iron-bound, I have treasured many a golden pound, Gold, gold, all gold,âa thousandfold More than you'll dream till they are told. All yours, love, when my sun has set, But that, my child, is a long time yet. âThis mighty forest must come down, And bring more gold from yonder town; They want the wood wherewith to build, I want the gold for a plan unfilled, For I must rear a mansion grand, Grander than any in the land, At which the envious world will stare, As if a prince were quartered there; And you the mistress of it all, The princess of that noble hall; And then, at last, the queen, my dear; The queen! but not this many a year. âThese cabins of my tenants old Must fall. They mar my dream of gold. They pay no rent; the men, infirm, Have all outlived their useful term; Their homes must all come down, and yield Their space to the golden harvest-field:â Down, down!â And he rubbed his hands with glee, Gloating over his prophecy! The child gazed up with a look of pain, That could not make the justice plain, And sighed, âBut would not that be wrong, Since they have worked for you so long? What will become of the frail and old, If they have neither strength nor gold?â âThat is naught to me,â he said, âmy child; Chide from your brain those questions wild: Who made them poor, and left them so, Must feed his ravens; let them go! My thoughts with grander schemes are filled, I want free scope whereon to build! âAnd see, the mill-dam, there, is broke! And he whose heart was tough as oak, Too old to toil, too proud to sue, Sits on the sill with naught to do. And other mills, some miles away, Grind larger grists for smaller pay, And, therefore, must the mill come down!â Then the little child, with that piteous frown, Which is not anger, but seems to keep The tears back that she fain would weep, Demanded, with low, thoughtful head, âWhat will the people do for bread?â âThe best they can,âthe best they can!â Was the jeering answer of the man. âLet them go beg their cup and crust; The old mill shall come down to dust! The spot be cleared, the dam be filled, To help the landscape when I build!â He rubbed his hands with new delight, Then, taking one more circling sight, And with his own heart reconciled, Led home the little wondering child. That night the old man ate and drank, Thinking only of wealth and rank, And the mansion, which was all to him. He drank till his filmy eyes grew dim, Then, in his great deep-cushioned chair, Slept, and forgot his golden care. He slept; the chin upon his breast Sunk deep and deeper into rest, Till, with a sudden, noiseless sway, The dam of life was borne away. And now the stream lay dead and still; The breast was cheerless as the mill; The heart rung like a sultry wheel, Where ne'er again the wave shall reel, And never yet was one so skilled, That dusty ruin to rebuild. Then laughed that shadowy miser, who Hath countless coffers, old and new, All buried full, and more to fill. âThe dam is broke, the cumbrous mill Is useless now: the fate is just; Come down it must; ay, down to dust!â And, rubbing his ghostly hands in glee, Gloated over his prophecy. Then spake an angel, on whose tongue The tremulous voice of pity hung, âWhat will become of the houseless soulâ He who sat there taking toll? An outcast into nameless ways, Where foot of charity never strays; Too old to toil; too late to sue; What will the friendless wanderer do?â âThat's naught to me!â the shade replied. âLet the spirits which he deified, Which made him rich, yet kept him poor, Look to him now, for at my door No mercy dwells! Come down it must, This crumbling clayâdown, down to dust; And that last mansion which he willed, My busy architect shall build!â THE WESTERN VINE. I sing the vine,âthe western vine, The newly found, but not unsung; Whose magic to the minstrel's tongue Made music flow through every line. Within its mellow amber deeps A mild and soothing spirit dwells, As innocent as that which sleeps In Poesy's Castalian wells. Then bless the wine, the mellow wine, That flows from the Catawba vine. From east to west this vine shall spread, Embowering all our vales and hills, And half of all our daily ills Shall vanish where its light is shed; The fields are joyous where it grows, It makes the rugged hill-sides glad, And where with vines the porch is clad, There dwells the spirit of repose. Then bless the wine, the mellow wine, That flows from the Catawba vine. The fiends that lurk in burning draughts Shall no more poison cups of ours; But when with us young Bacchus laughs, O'ershadowed by our vineyard bowers, The god shall think his cup is filled With honey-dew, at morn distilled By Flora from her purest flowers. Then bless the wine, the mellow wine, That flows from the Catawba vine. Oh, tell us not, ye over-wise, That God his choicest fruit has banned; Those clusters from the Promised Land Were welcome to the prophet's eyes. Let him who would dilute his blood With water at the festive board, Remember how the crystal flood Was turned to purple by our Lord. Then bless the wine, the mellow wine, That flows from the Catawba vine. And yet, beneath these glorious skies, A nobler Vine o'erreaches all; In its support, or in its fall, A mighty nation lives or dies; Its boughs are weighed with Freedom's fruit, Beyond the hungry fox's reach. With sturdy shoulders, each to each, Come, let us guard it branch and root! And bless the wine, the sacred wine, That flows from our great Union vine. BURNS'S BIRTHDAY. My friends, the grape that charms the cup to-night Should be the noblest ever grown in cluster; Our flowers of wit and song should be so bright That all the place should wear a noontide lustre. For he whose natal day, and marvellous worth, We strive to honor with our yearly presence, Was of that clay so seldom found on earth, On which the gods bestow their purest essence. Ay, doubly bright should this ovation be; For we are honored far beyond your dreaming. The inward spirit bids me look and see Where comes the bard with light and music teeming. He comes, but not, like Hamlet's sire, to wring The soul with fear, and urge to painful duty; He comes; let us behold the phantom king, The king of song, and marvel at his beauty. I see his presence in the luminous air, And feel no thrill to make my blood run colder; He stands beside our presidential chair, With loving arm upon a Scotchman's shoulder. Upon his brow a crown of glory beams; His robe of splendor makes the lamplight hazy; In his right hand a pledging goblet gleams, The other holds a âcrimson-tippet daisy.â Of deathless rainbows is his tartan plaid; His bonnet now is the celestial laurel; And on his face the light of song betrayed Makes all the room with poesy grow choral. With eye of inspiration stands the bard; His lips are moving, though no sound can follow. Let me translate,âalthough the task is hard, To justly render Scotland's sweet Apollo. âDear friends, and brother Scotsmen, doubly dear,â 'Tis thus the poet looks his kind oration, âThe day is come, which once in every year Calls me to make my wonted visitation. âI glide through Caledonian halls of mirth, Where votive feast and song together mingle; I seek the cot,âthe sweetest place on earth Is just the simple peasant's glowing ingle. âThe haughty Briton lights his dusk saloon, Forgetting all his rancor for Prince Charley, And to the ploughman-bard of Ayr and Doon Pledges the smoking bree of Scottish barley. âWhere'er a ship upon the ocean swings, To-night, before the mariners seek their pillows, My songs shall sail on their melodious wings, Like sea-birds o'er the phosphorescent billows. âBy Indian river, and Australian mine, And by the wall of China's old dominions, My verse above their cups of mellow wine Shall fan the air to music with its pinions. âThe far Canadian winter hears my name; E'en where the trapper's northern home is chosen, The songs of Scotland, mingling with the flame, Warm all within, though all without be frozen. âBy Californian shores and forests old, Where, like a mighty bard new realms discerning, The gray Pacific, over sands of gold, Chants his great song, the glittering metal spurning; âIn new-built towns, and round the miner's lamp, Or on the plains, or by the Colorado; Where'er the far adventurous train may camp, My song to-night shall cheer the deepest shadow. âOr in the snow-beleaguered tents of strife, By jocund fires, or beds of painful story, Health shall take courage, and the sick new life, To hear of Wallace, and of Bruce's glory. âOh that my song might be as bolts of fire, Within the grasp of soldiers and of seamen! The bard profanely wakes the sacred lyre, Who chants no strain to nerve the hearts of freemen. âFrom town to town, obedient to the call, I pass in haste, for envious Time is fleeting, As oft before, within this noble hall, I greet the friends who cheer me with their greeting. âHere in your midst, my brothers, once again, I stand to-night a saddened guest and speaker; I miss among you certain noble men, Who erewhile pledged me in a brimming beaker. âFor your sakes saddened,ânot, my friends, for mine,â You mourn their music, and their pleasant sallies; But we together pledge nectarean wine And join our song in amaranthine valleys. âI see the forms your sight cannot discern; I see the smile across their happy faces; With eye of loving faith look round and learn Your friends are here,âthere are no empty places. âFrom shadowy goblets held in fingers dim, We drain the glass that keeps the memory vernal, Our cups with yours are clinking brim to brim, And thus we pledge you in a draught fraternal. âAdieu, adieu! across the eternal sea Still let us hear your pleasant song and laughter, And let the love you bear me, warrant be Of love as deep for all true bards hereafter.â TO BRYANT, ON HIS SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY. What time I ope, with reverential love, One of the charmÃ©d volumes of my choice, I hear, as in the cloister of the grove, The solemn music of thy Druid voice. All sights and sounds that can delight impart, Or whatsoe'er athwart thy vision swims, Before the altar of the world's great heart, Thou nobly breathest in undying hymns. For thy broad love there is no flower too small, Nor scene too vast for thy encircling mind; Thy heart is one with Nature's, yet o'er all Rises its sweet vibrations for mankind. The faintest breath that finds a flowery nook; The flying winds with wild and gust-wise locks; The pebble, which the lapidary brook Rounds into form, or ocean, scorning, rocks; The burnished bluebird with the spring-time song; The azure-wingÃ©d runnel's April call; The timid wren, the falcon fierce and strong; The soaring water-fowl, the swooping fall; The glowworm's lantern, and the lunar car; The midnight taper, and the noonday sun; The pool where swims the lily like a star; The boundless sea, with lily-sails o'errun; The brooklet-blade, the brightest wavelet moves Where childhood's paper sails are set unfurled; The antique home, or shade; the oaken groves, Growing the ponderous navies of the world; The peaceful hearthstone, and the roaring field; The song-bird, and our eagle on his crag; The love that all that quiet home can yield; The love of country, freedom, and her flag:â All these are thine, thou pioneer of song, Bard of the prairie and primeval grove; And unto thee our praise may well belong; Yes, more than praiseâthe homage of our love. And this is thine and therefore I obey, And bow before thy Druid locks of snow; And on thy sacred altar here I lay My votive branch of western mistletoe. TO HYPERION. Our land is like a prairie overswept With tempest flame, around the horizon whirled; By fiery swords our harvest-fields are reapt; By maniac winds the blazing sheaves are hurled; Where swift Destruction strides through cinders deep, The blinding ashes, blown about the world, Whiten our sackcloth where we sit and weep. The whole broad sky is choked with fire and dust; With reeling clouds of sulphur overrun, What wonder that the bright star of your trust, The noble planet of your minstrel dawn, Should be this hour, by careful Heaven withdrawn, Caught by a sudden and celestial gust Into the glad embraces of the sun? DAWN. Within a gray Empire of dawn and of dew, Where rung the clear clarion which chanticleer blew; Which sang to the stars, and rang round to the sea, Proclaiming a triumph and glory to be;â A realm where the air of the primeval gloom Was thick with night-opening blossoms' perfumes; Where all the wide world of those delicate blooms, The heirs of the daylight, lay still in their tombs, Awaiting the summons, by young April given, Blown down through the morning-lit portals of Heaven: There, dank with the dew, and o'erveiled with this dawn, The shadowy nations went towering on, Enlarged by the dimness, gigantic, sublime, They walked in this long-vanished twilight of Time. There were marvellous marble-built marts where the sea Proclaimed the same problem he utters to me; There were shadowy fanes on each shadowy height, And purple-dusk pyramids piercing the night So far, that their pinnacles dialed the sky; And the stars, for the shepherds to calendar by, Their peaks in the blue, and their feet in the sand; Each a tomb in its gloom, that o'ershadowed the land, And between, meaning more than philosophy thinks, In the desert, breast-deep, sat, like Egypt, the Sphinx. There were altars aflush with the horrible sign, As if Murder had thrown his red cloak on the shrine; And statues of Terror, with faces uncouth, Where the world in its error still stumbled at truth. And a murmur arose, as when billows in vain Rage round some lone rock that no answer will deign. Strange Druidical henges encircled the wold; Dusk granite enigmas, no time can unfold; Great dogmas in stone, a grand, terrible creed; A hieroglyphic worship, God only could read. Along these great woods, and among these great piles, A priesthood, mysterious, shed awe through the aisles. In vain the sweet herbage looked up from the sod And pointed to Heaven, and whispered of God; And the night preached in vain, with its stars and its tears, The truths it has taught through its millions of years. Still the soul in its chains, self-abased and abused, The light only dazzled, sounds only confused, Till a God, in His pity, came down as a child, And walked 'mid those temples which night had defiled, And solved the old riddles in language so plain That the mystery dispelled could not settle again. Then man, in his wisdom, perverse as a blast, Dismantled the world of each shred of the past; The piles were no longer Divinity's throne; The rocks were but rocks, and the sphinx but a stone. The hills were disrobed, and the groves were but trees, And the voice of the ocean was only the seas. But the faith of the bard may not scorn what is gone: While it stands in the noon it looks back to the dawn. Believing the good in all worships, it feels A divinity present wherever it kneels. TO R. H., ON RECEIVING FROM HIM A BEAUTIFUL SILVER FRUIT-DISH, CHRISTMAS, 1864. Out of what charmÃ©d artist's brain Came the beautiful form I here behold? The soul of a glorious Greek, it is plain, Must have dreamed this dream of silver and gold. Perchance he lived in an attic cold, His guest the sun, and the rain, and the wind; His only riches the wealth untold Which glows and gleams in the artist mind; Doomed never to taste the far-off fruit That shall crown this carved and delicate brim. Does he walk the world? or is he mute In the dust of buried ages dim? Though he lives or sleeps in his funeral suit, The heart of the bard goes out to him. With this wonderful work before me placed, So pure in its beauty, embossed and chased, The fancy suddenly plumes her wing And flies to regions where never yet Her noiseless and venturous feet were set, And, as she flies, she needs must sing; She hovers o'er Indian mines afar, And seeks the fabulous Ophir field; And Palestine under its Christmas star; Or, in Hellas, finds some Homerian shield, Into ingots made by the greed of a Turk; Or beautiful censer, a rare antique, Swung in the hands of a Roman or Greek; Or delicate image, Athenian work, Melted and sold by some infidel thief, Whom the gods have long since brought to grief; Or wonderful vase, by Cellini made, To grace the cloth of some princely board; Or traces within the Cathedral shade Those sainted and silver statues fine, Which Cromwell, going from shrine to shrine, Cast angrily down in the name of the Lord, Then rolled them in coin through the world of trade, Till they slept, perchance, in a miser's hoard. She sweeps where Brazilian summer shines Into the shades of the Andean mines; By turbulent rivers, broad, deep, and bold, 'Mid California's hills of gold; Under giant cedars, antique as man, Planted ere History's life began; And there beholds, in its glittering birth, The new-found ore as old as the earth. A thousand mystical guesses arise And swim in the dream-light of her eyesâ But all in vain; she only knows That this beautiful form before her glows, Silver without and golden within; It gleams like a rising harvest-moon, When labor ceases and pleasures begin In a land of fruit at the close of June. Alive with its light is the twilight room, And already I breathe the sweet perfume, The delicious odors that seem to swim Around its future laden brim; The grape and the plum, the pear and the peach, All these seem glowing within my reach, And mingling its delicate odor and smile Is the fruit of many a far-off isle; But sweeter still the thought ascends, Around it I see kind groups of friends. The metal solid, and massive, and pure, And wrought with all skill that an artist can lend; But there's something exists that I value still moreâ It is this; and the Master Designer, I'm sure, Took out from Humanity's mine the best ore To make itâthe generous heart of my friend. OUR SOLDIERS' FAMILIES. A PROLOGUE, DELIVERED ON THE OCCASION OF AN AMATEUR PERFORMANCE OF HAMLET FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE SOLDIERS' FAMILIES IN CINCINNATI, FEBRUARY 6, 1865. Our soldiers' families! How the fancy roams, And finds these patient patriots in their homes; Finds them at quiet firesidesânobly thereâ Waiting beside the hero's empty chair; Beside the chair, perchance, which never more Shall know the occupant it knew of yore. Look in to-night beside that tranquil fire: There sits the mother, there the aged sire; Or there the wife, with matron accents mild, Teaching a patriot prayer unto her child; A prayer for him who put his all at stake, His all (save honor), for his country's sake. There sits the maid with eyes of dreamful light, Watching her warrior-lover in the fight; Beholds him with a swelling heart of pride With fiery Phil along the valley ride; Or Grant, or Thomas, our stern, sturdy George, Whose stalwart blows fall thundering like a forge; Or, with his eastward banner, sees him swoop Through Georgian fields with Sherman's eagle troop. Perchance his lot is on the ocean cast, Where Farragut stands steadfast as his mast; Perchance, with Winslow, poured the shot and shell From guns which rung the British pirate's knell; Or at Stone River stemmed the leaden shower, Where noble âRoseyâ saved the desperate hour; Or with that glorious chief to whom was given The right to scale above the clouds of heaven, And bear the starry rainbow flag on high, Back to its native region in the sky. Behold our general, on the rocky height, A stately statue in a dome of light! With all the rebel army put to rout, Our fighting Hooker takes a long âLookout!â While through his army shouts on shouts increase, Hailing this true commissioner of Peace. Our soldiers' families! Some are veiled in gloom; The mourners' crape pervades the solemn room; There, though the tears in sorrowing eyes may start, There is no murmur in a patriot heart. Though sad the lot, the recompense is plain, They hear the falling of the bondman's chain, And hear the song of freedom from the South, While shouts of âUnionâ pass from mouth to mouth; In glory's cause the warrior died content, With human liberty for monument. Our soldiers' families! Mark the glorious sight; For them the Swan of Avon sings to-night, The earth's great laureate, whose immortal skill Created worlds and peopled them at will, Whose wizard wand, at one majestic swing, Could make a kingdom, or dethrone a king; For them he bids the spectre monarch rise; For them the sweet Ophelia sings and dies; For them he asks a sovereign of our own To leave to-night his magisterial throne, To lay aside awhile his genial vein, To look, and think, and be the melancholy Dane. Our soldiers' families! For them have come This generous audience, packed from pit to dome. For them (would it were worthier) here I lay Upon their altar this, my light bouquet; And if, perchance, their kindly eyes should view Among the leaves some random drops of dew, Believe them each the poet's loving tear In secret shed beside some patriot's bier. Newly descended from their high estate, For them, be sure, the angels watch and wait; Our patriot sires, who all our freedom gave, Look down and bless the households of the brave; But, grander still, within his dome of domes, God smiles His blessing on our Soldiers' Homes! EPITHALAMIUM. TO MAJOR-GENERAL W?. There's a glorious group in Parian stone, Which made the sculptor a deathless name; War stands with his strong arm gently thrown Round Beauty, that lives in immortal fame, By the gods conceded the brightest and best; Her light hand lies on his manly breast, To find, as it were, how his great heart stirs. His noble eyes look down on hersâ That look which only love confersâ While hers beam tenderly up to him In the depth of their love-light, dewy dim; And over both, with hymeneal flame, Brave Cupid proclaims his triumphant endeavorâ Then Beauty and War, in the world of fame, Stand wedded in spotless marble forever. And thus our Union Mars to-day, A warrior as noble, as brave, as tall, Stands with his bride, and over all Love hovers, and whispers his sweet commands, Blessing the union of hearts and hands; And, joining with him in his dear endeavor, Let us bless the Union for ever and ever. THE CABLE. LAID BY THE âAGAMEMNONâ and âNIAGARA.â 'Tis fit the grand old kingly name Of which the kingliest poet sings Should eastward bear Jove's track of flame, And link it to the land of kings. 'Tis well Niagara, whose renown With Freedom mingles evermore, Should westward lay its burden down, And chain the world to Freedom's shore. 'Tis done; the angry sea consentsâ The nations stand no more apart; With claspÃ©d hands the continents Feel throbbings of each other's heart. Speed, speed the Cable; let it run, A loving girdle, round the earth, Till all the nations 'neath the sun Shall be as brothers at one hearth,â As brothers, pledging hand in hand, One freedom for the world abroad, One commerce over every land, One language, and one God! WHAT A WORD MAY DO. One day, as we sat at a generous board, Where wine with a liberal hand was poured, I heard a beautiful lady say, Whose lord had sometimes gone astray, Just as the sparkling cup was raised, That one too much for a social dinnerâ A rebuke, I am sure, the angels praisedâ âI hate the sin, but I love the sinner.â Down went the cup to the snowy cloth, Brimming and laughing with creamy froth, That quickly flattened below the brim, While the master's eye with a haze grew dim; And, ever after, the wine at his side Wooed him in vain as it sparkled and died; And though he should sit at the board of a duke, 'Mid the kingliest wines of a princely dinner, He would still remember that sweet rebuke, âI hate the sin, but I love the sinner.â TO LUCY. Light. ACCOMPANIED BY A TOY. Dear Lucy, the light of your sweet little face I have heard by good judges proclaimed; If it bears of your beautiful mother a trace, Then, darling, you are properly named. They christened you âLucy,â my dear little one, And, if what I am told is half true, That you shine in the house like a ray of the sun, I don't know what else they could do. A dear, truant angel, just out of the sky, You needs must be radiant, I'm sure: May the light of your smile, and the light of your eye, Undimmed in their lustre endure! With this toyâno great thing, but it still might be worseâ You can whistle, or ring out a chime; Accept, too, this poor penny-whistle of verse, With its light jingling rattle of rhyme. THE FOOL'S ARROW. The fool who shot against the noon-day sun, Then stood agape to note the mischief done, Just as he thought the missile at its place, Received the returning arrow in his face; But, still a fool,âthough bleeding, and in pain,â His vanity could make the matter plain: âBehold!â he cried, âApollo's jealous spite Lets fly this shaft at my superior light!â EPITAPH. FOR MRS. M?. Toward the dark gate we saw her slowly glide, The angel Patience moving at her side; The noiseless portal opened, and the light A moment gleamed, then left us in the night, Where still we sit beside her sacred urn, Praying the angel Patience to return. HEART AND HEARTH. We sat and watched the hearth-fire blaze, My friend and I together; The crickets sang of harvest days, The wood of summer weather. It told of shade, of storm and sun, Its native oakland story: To him it only spake of one Who turned all gloom to glory. The cricket carolled still of noon, Bright with the sun's caresses; To him it called a form like June, Aflush with golden tresses. Within the flame a spirit seemed To soar and sway and falter, While in his heart a presence beamed More steadfast on its altar. The embers, in their ashen bed, Looked out with transient flashes; He only saw sweet eyes that shed Their rays through twilight lashes. O'er stubbled fields the autumn wailed, In low and mournful closes: He only heard a song that sailed O'er charmÃ©d realms of roses. His eyes, once lit with battle-ire, Aflame with warrior-science, Forgot their fierce, controlling fire, Their flashes of defiance; But, with a dreamy love-light blest, More luminous grew and tender, As if the image in his breast Had lit them with its splendor. The voice that once his ardor proved, Along the roaring column, Now to mysterious measures moved Subdued, serenely solemn. He named herâand the soft words came In musical completeness, As if the breathing of that name Had touched his lips with sweetness. We grow like what we contemplateâ And all his face was laden With light, as it would emulate The brightness of the maiden. The moon, full blown to lily-white, Looked in, with love-lorn pallor; She knew his frame forgot its might, His will forgot its valor. She kissed his brow and smoothed his hair, Like a consoling mother, And whispered, âI too only wear The brightness of another. âLike Ruth, I walk his broad domain, And wait his lordly gesture; I glean his light, but reach in vain To touch his princely vesture.â With many a sympathetic guest, The air hung, star-beleaguered, When lo! to her who filled his breast, Pale Dian stood transfigured. She smiled on her Endymion, And charmed his dreamy vision, And all his soul new glory won Before the sweet transition. The vision fledâmy friend was gone, And left me idly gazing; But in the hearth-light I was shown A future altar blazing. THE GOLDEN NOW. The earth is loud with discontentments muttered By foolish mouthsâthe selfish and the vain; And yet a world of agony unuttered Lies behind lips that never tell their pain. The voiceless dark is loaded with repentance, In solemn courts of midnight, where, o'ercast With sorrow, Conscience looks its silent sentence Against the culprit actions of the past. And countless eyes, aglaze with hot reflections, Stare down the highway which their feet have known, Where stand afar the ghostly recollections, Like frowning statues not to be o'erthrown. While fancy sees them rise in retributions, A spectre file along the future way, To blight the hopes and chill the resolutions Which Night should marshal for the coming day. Oh, ye who cower or tremble at the errors Rebuking Memory conjures where you wait, Rise, and against the past with all its terrors, With hand indignant, swing the iron gate! Rise in the Golden Now, and ope its portal, That doorway which to-morrow never opesâ Worthy your manhood and your soul immortal, Go forward to the harvest of your hopes. Nor let the future mantle of December Become a coward's sack cloth, ashen gray, To doom your aged anguish to remember The precious chances you refuse today. What's done is doneâlet errors past recalling In gulfy waters of oblivion drown: The fret of retrospection, hot and galling, Wilts to the root the flower of courage down, Until despair half makes the soul contented To sit reluctant at the yet untried; Perpetual brooding over what's repented Is but the drug of constant suicide. Such sorrow is a winter owl, foreboding For future wildernesses nights of care, While cheerful thoughts are happy song-birds, loading With May-time music all the summer air. The vain regrets we nurture in our bosoms Are deadly nightshades, which we feed with tears; But all the heart becomes a bed of blossoms, When hope is jocund and contentment cheers. Shake from your feet the dust with wholesome scorning Against the ugly, ne'er-to-be undone! From out the cloudy darkness, like the morning, With glowing brow go forth into the sun, And to the duty nearest, most defiant, With steadfast courage, lay your shouldered strength, And, conquering more than cities, like a giant, Arise the master of yourself at length. Prophetic hopes shall lead you to new pleasures, Along the yielding pathway of the plough, To yellow harvests and to orchard treasures, The fruit of action in the Golden Now. And when the tranquil evening crowns your labor With sheaves, and fruits, and welcome household songs. At peace with Heaven, your conscience, and your neighbor, Resign your prayerful heart where it belongs. Rome, November, 1871. MY LILY ON THE VIRGIN'S BOSOM. The sun was white in all the streets of Florence, His splendor burned upon the bridge and river, While fate rained down her pestilence in torrents, Bereaving me forever. Nay; not forever! on the Virgin's bosom I see the emblem of my sainted daughterâ She holds my lily in perpetual blossomâ I find her where I sought her. Close to her heart, with all a mother's patience, She bears my flower, enticing me to meet her: Dear Virgin, at thy Son's appointed Stations I kneel, and kneel, and climb, That I at last may greet her. THE SLEEP OF DEATH. We nightly die ourselves to sleep, Then wherefore fear we Death? 'Tis but a slumber still more deep, And undisturbed by breath. We daily waken to the light, When Morning walks her way, Then wherefore doubt Death's longer night Will bring a brighter day? A CHRISTMAS HYMN. The air was still o'er Bethlehem's plain, As if the great Night held its breath, When Life Eternal came to reign Over a world of Death. The pagan at his midnight board Let fall his brimming cup of gold: He felt the presence of his Lord Before His birth was told. The temples trembled to their base, The idols shuddered as in pain: A priesthood in its power of place Knelt to its gods in vain. All Nature felt a thrill divine When burst that meteor on the night, Which, pointing to the Saviour's shrine, Proclaimed the new-born lightâ Light to the shepherds! and the star Gilded their silent midnight foldâ Light to the Wise Men from afar, Bearing their gifts of gold. Light to a realm of Sin and Griefâ Light to a world in all its needsâ The Light of lifeâa new belief Rising o'er fallen creedsâ Light on a tangled path of thorns, Though leading to a martyr's throneâ A Light to guide till Christ returns In glory to His own. There still it shines, while far abroad The Christmas choir sings now, as then, âGlory, glory unto God! Peace and good-will to men!â Rome, Christmas, 1871.</field>
