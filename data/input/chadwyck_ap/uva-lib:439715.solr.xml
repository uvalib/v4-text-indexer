      <field name="fulltext">Part One: Religious Meditations The Body of Divinity Versifyed. A God there is, a God of boundless Might, In Wisdom, Justice, Goodness, Infinite. God is but One and yet in Persons Three. The Father, Son, and Spirit, One God we see. Our God, by His Great Name JEHOVAH known, HE the World Made, and Keeps, and Rules Alone. To Glorify the Glorious God, is That For which He did all men, and me Create. God a Just Rule doth in our Bible give, A Rule, both what to Think, and how to Live. Holy &amp; Happy our First Parents came From Gods Hand, with Gods Image in our Frame. Tasting Forbidden Fruit our Parents fell; This Taste has plung'd Mankind all down to Hell. Our Blest Lord JESUS CHRIST, in our Distress, Comes to fetch us from Hell to Blessedness. Into his Person, the Bright Son of God, A Virgins Son took; There He makes Abode. Life as a Priest CHRIST will His People bring, Light as a Prophet, &amp; Law as a King. For us our Surety Liv'd, for us he Dy'd, And Rising did to Heaven in Triumph Ride. By Faith to Christ we for Salvation go; Faith too, as well as That must He bestow. For Sin will the Renew'd Believer Mourn, And from all Sin, he'l by Repentance Turn. Sinners receiving of Gods Pardon, they Gods Precept will, made Saints, with Love Obey. All Homage we must yield unto the Lord; In all directed, by His Heavenly Word. His Works and Names, we may not use in Vain; Nor by our Works thereon His Days Profane. With Honours due we must our Neighbours treat; And sweetly wish them Lives both Long &amp; Sweet. With Chastity we must our selves Behave; And do no Wrong in what we Get or Save. Truth we must utter, &amp; abhor to Lye; And be Content, tho' in Adversity. Them who to be in CHRIST, thro' Grace, Consent, God brings into His Gracious Covenant. The Baptism of the Lord, assures that we Both Wash'd from Sin, &amp; Rais'd from Death, shall be. To See the Lord, we at His Table Sitt, And Show, that we shall in His Kingdom Eat. Gods Children His good Promises Enjoy: And Good comes of what Ill may them annoy. His Angels He to them does Guardians make, And these their Souls, at their Departure take. To Judge the World, CHRIST will descend at Last; A Righteous Doom shall by that Judge be past. The Wicked shall bear bitter Pain and Shame, With Wicked Spirits in Eternal Flame. The Godly shall, with their Great GOD, on High, Reap Joyes, High Joyes, to all Eternity. Conversion Exemplified. AND now, to Life Rais'd by the Heav'nly Call, Henceforth Vain Idols, I Renounce you all. Vile Flesh, Thy raging Lust, and sordid Ease, My winged Soul now shall not serve and please. False World, Thy Laws shall be no longer mine, Nor to thy Wayes my New-born Soul incline. Satan, Thou wilt, I know, my Tempter be; But thy Temptation shall not Govern me. Foolish I've been; O Lord, I blush, I grieve; And gladly would my Woful Folly leave. Fain would I Turn to God; but can't alone: Help, Sovereign Grace, or it will ne'er be done! To the Great GOD of Heaven I repair, And Help'd by Heaven, thus to Him declare. Great GOD, Since to be Mine Thou willing art, Oh! Be Thou mine! Replies my Conquered Heart. To Glorify Thee, Glorious Lord, I take, For That alone, which can me Happy make. O FATHER, of all Things Creator Great, Wilt thou all Happiness for me Create? Eternal SON of God, Wilt thou me Save, That I the Hopes may of a Gods Children have? Eternal SPIRIT of God, Poor me wilt thou With Spiritual Blessings of all sorts Endow? Lord, Ravish'd at thy wondrous Grace, I do These Gracious Offers now Conform unto. O All-sufficient ONE, Wilt thou supply My Wants from Stores of rich Immensity? Shall Boundless Wisdome for my Good Contrive? And Boundless Power ye Fruits of Goodness Give? Shall Spotless Holiness on me Imprint, An Holy Temper, with thine Image in't? Lord, Thy Perfections all I do adore, And to a Perfect Love my mind would soar. A State of BLISS, according to thy Word Thou wilt unto thy Chosen Ones afford. A State of Blissful Rest and Joy, wherein Rais'd from the Dead, they shall be freed from Sin. There Bath'd in Rivers of Eternal Joy, No Sorrows more shall them at all annoy. GOD shall be All in All; Brought nigh to God, In Him they shall forever make Abode. They shall See God; The Beatific Sight And their own God shall take in them Delight. My Soul, Make now thy Choice. O say; Is This What thou dost Choose for thy Chief Blessedness? Things of this Present Time! now Refuse; My Blessed GOD, Thee, Thee, and This, I Chuse. May the sweet JESUS me to Glory bring, And be my Glorious Prophet, Priest, and King. Does the Almighty SON of God, to those That Will, an Union with Himself propose? My Lord, I will! The Will thou didst bestow: To Thee, Oh, Let me be United so. The full Obedience which my Surety paid To God, may That my Righteousness be made. A Wretched Sinner would appear in That, Righteous before the dreadful Judgment-Seat. Show me thy Way, O Lord, Lest that I shou'd Fall by those Mockers that will me delude. To thy Pure Scriptures-Way I will adhere, And find the Rule of my whole Conduct there. All the Rebellion of my Heart Subdue; And for thy work, O Lord, my Strength Renew. From thy vast Fulness let my Faith derive Strength to do all things, and to Thee to Live. May thy Good SPIRIT me Possess, and Fill With Light and Zeal, to Learn and Do thy Will. With His Kind Flames may He upon me Sieze [sic], And keep me alwayes on my Bended Knees. May all I am and have, be us'd for Him Whose is my All, for He did me Redeem. To Thee, Good SPIRIT, I lift up my Cries, That thou wilt fall upon the Sacrifice. May thy Bright ANGELS, be my Guardians then; For Thee, they'l Guard and Guide the Sons of Men. By Thee assisted, LORD, Thus I Consent Unto thy Everlasting COVENANT. My Satisfaction. From Heb. XII. 5,6,11. The Exhortation of the Lord, With Consolation speaks to us; As unto His Children, His Good Word, We must Remember Speaking Thus, My Child, When God shall Chasten Thee, His Chastning do thou not contemn: When thou His just Rebukes dost see, Faint not Rebuked under them. The Lord with Fit Afflictions will Correct the Children of His Love; He doth Himself their Father still, By His most wise Corrections prove. Afflictions for the present here The vexed Flesh will Grievous call; But Afterward there will appear, Not Grief, but Peace, the End of all. My Resignation. [From Heb. 11.17. with Gen. 22.12.] The Dearest Lord of Heaven gave Himself an Offering once for me: The Dearest Thing on Earth I have, Now, Lord, I'll offer unto Thee. I see my best Enjoyments here, Are Loans, and Flow'rs, and Vanities; E're well Enjoy'd they disappear: Vain Smoke, they prick and leave our Eyes. But I Believe, O Glorious Lord, That when I seem to Lose these Toyes, What's Lost will fully be Restor'd In Glory, with Eternal Joyes. I do Believe, That I and mine, Shall come to Everlasting Rest; Because, Blest Jesus, we are Thine, And with thy Promises are Blest. I do Believe, That ev'ry Bird Of mine, which to the Ground shall fall, Does fall at thy kind Will and Word; Nor I, nor It, is hurt at all. Now my Believing Soul does Hear This among the Glad Angels told; I know, thou dost thy Maker Fear, From whom thou nothing dost withold! My Resolution. Job I. 21. Naked came I out of my Mothers womb, and Naked shall I return thither: The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; Blessed be the Name of the Lord. I Strip't of Earthly Comforts am: Strip't let me duely Mourn: Naked from Earth at first I came; And Naked I return. What, but Gifts from Above were they? GOD gave them unto me. And now they Take their Flight away, Taken by GOD they be. The Name of my great GOD, I will For ever then Adore: HEE'S Wise, and Just, and Sov'raign still, And Good for ever more. Songs in Such a Night. Psal: 42.5,11. Oppress'd with Loads of Grief Art thou My Soul, O why dejected so? Why do thy Grevious passions now Into a Restless Tumult grow! In God thy Hope Rejoycing place; My God He is by Covenant; I'll praise Him still: Joy to my Face The Help of His will surely grant. I Sam. 1.15,18. My Spirit is, how Sorrowful! But Lord, I do pour out before Thy Grace the Sorrows of my Soul; And now I will be Sad no more. I Pet. 1.8. The CHRIST I see not, yet I know, I Trust and Love; Thro' CHRIST there is given A Joy unutterable to My Faith, a Joy that's full of Heaven. My Text Paraphrased, and Faith Exhibited. GODS Son Incarnate, now Akin To miserable me, From all the Miseries of Sin Sets me at Libertie. By His full Price to Justice paid, my Bonds of Death are Eas'd: By His Great Pow'r thereon display'd, Deaths Prisoner is Releas'd. That the Almighty JESUS is My own Redeemer now, By my Consenting to be His, On Terms of Grace, I know. I Know that my Redeemer Lives; His Grave detain'd Him not; Enthron'd, from His High Throne He gives, What in His Grave He bought. And now, I know that all He said, must be for ever True; His being Risen from the Dead His glorious Truth doth shew. I Know, when I or Mine shall Dy, We shall to Heaven go; Since our Fore-runner Lives on High concern'd for us below. [Go then, my Dove, but now no longer Mine!] Go then, my Dove, but now no longer Mine! Leave Earth, &amp; now in Heavenly Glory Shine. Bright for thy Wisdom, Goodness, Beauty here; Now Brighter in a more Angelick SphÃ¦re. JESUS, with whom thy Soul did long to be, Into His Ark, and Arms, has taken thee. Dear Friends with whom thou didst so dearly Live, Feel Thy one Death to Them a Thousand give. Thy Prayers are done; thy Alms are spent; thy Pains Are Ended now in Endless Joyes &amp; Gains. The Torch that gave my House its pleasant Light, Extinguish'd leaves it in how dark a Night! I faint, till thy last words to mind I call; Rich Words! Heav'n, Heav'n will make amends for all. The Language of a SOUL taken in, The Nets of Salvation. Grace Irresistible subdues me, Lord; And I no longer can Resist thy Word. My SOUL too long lies in its Grave forgot; Whose price bright Pearls, yea, whole Worlds Equal not: A SOUL whereto GOD such Respect ha's had; And which Repenting, would make Angels glad. I Loathe &amp; Leave now all the Paths of SIN, And Mourn that I have stray'd so long therein. The Paths of True Religion I prefer, As what most Just &amp; Good &amp; Lovely are. O Great JEHOVAH, Thou my God shalt be; And I my ALL surrender unto thee. My Life is in thy FAVOUR; Let me live In That, &amp; to thy Name all Glory give. Be though my Father, O Thou Three in One, My Saviour be, my Leader, Thou alone. Oh! May I know, &amp; Love, &amp; serve my God, And fill'd with Him, in Him have my Abode. I won't believe what the Destroyer sayes, Nor will I walk in his Destructive wayes. Thee, O my SAVIOUR, with a Lively Faith, I ask to Save me from Eternal Death. Me now Resign'd to thy most Glorious Hands; Free by thy Merits, Rule by thy Commands. O Wisdom, open thou my Sinful Eyes; And with a Light from Heaven make me wise. O Righteous One, let thy Obedience paid To God for me, my Righteousness be made. O Holy One, my Heart inflame with Zeal, In Flights of Holiness to do thy Will. O Strong Redeemer, Help a wretched Slave, And from Deaths Chains let me Redemption have. Lord, Me to thy Caelestial City bring, Where thy dear Saints behold no grievous thing There let me See, &amp; with the Sight, possess My JESUS, in Compleat and Endless Bliss. In Hope of that Rich Bliss, I will despise This Vain World, and its Lying Vanities. FINIS The Consent. In imitation of the Virgin's Answer to the Angel. [Luk. i.38.] Great GOD: Thy Chosen People shall Each one to Thee be Called home: And to a Choice of thee they All On thy Heart-conq'ring Call shall come. God, Father, Son, and Spirit, make Tenders that overcome us quite: I'll be your GOD; He sayes: I'll take In you, as in dear Sons delight. The Lord-Redeemer does propose To Pay for us a wondrous Price; To guide our Wayes; to quell our Foes; And Lodge us in Eternal Bliss. Dissolv'd by such sweet Rayes of Grace, Darted from Thee, most Gracious Lord; Behold, Thy willing Servant Prayes, Fulfil to me thy Glorious Word. JESUS, Our Holy Surety did Work out a Righteousness compleat; Sinners, Tis yours, He sayes, to Plead, Righteous before Gods Judgment-seat. Our Sin, of Enemies the worst, This, God will Pardon and Subdue; Tis this, O God, for which I thirst! Sins Death, Saints as their Life pursue. When Tempted, our kind Friend on High, Succours will send us down from thence; To Him, we in Temptations fly; And Favours Hee'l by them dispense. Dissolv'd by such sweet Rayes of Grace, Darted from Thee, most Gracious Lord; Behold, Thy willing Servant Prayes, Fulfill to me thy Glorious Word. Our Spirits Born from Heav'n above, God will for Heav'nly Flights prepare; Then them to Paradise remove, And Blessed Visions grant them there. Our Cleansed Bodies from the Grave, He to our Spirits will restore; In them we shall New Mansions have, Bright, Strong; And, death shall be no more. So, in the CITY of our God, Him we shall Serve, and Love, and See: O City of our Long Abode; How Long, till we arrive to thee! Dissolv'd by such Sweet Rayes of Grace, Darted from Thee, most Gracious Lord; Behold, Thy willing Servant Prayes, Fulfill to me thy Glorious Word.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Part Two: Elegies and Epitaphs A POEM Dedicated to the Memory OF The Reverend and Excellent MR. URIAN OAKES, the late Pastor to Christ's Flock, and PrÃ¦sident of Harvard-Colledge, in Cambridge, Who was gathered to his People on 25? 5?? 1681. In the fifty'th Year of his Age. TO THE READER. Worthies to Praise is a Praise-worthy thing; Christ did it; and will do it! And to Sing The Elogyes of Saints departed in The Rhythm of Elegyes, has always been Esteemed Reason! David bids me go My Christian Reader! and like him do so.

And brought These as a Pattern, and a Plea for what I do; that my cross Reader blame me not. But why so late? my NÃ¦nia's some will deem Both out of Time, and Tune!

Never Poet had His Quill employ'd upon a Theme so sad As what just Providence (Grief grumble not) Do's with black Warrant Press mee to! O what? This! OAKES is dead!

There is enough to squeese a briny Tear From the most flinty Flint: Once at the Blow Of Moses, from a Rock a Stream did flow; But look! th' Almightye's Rod now Smites us home Oh! what Man won't a Mourner now become? Dear Saint! I cannot but thy Herse bedew With dropping of some Fun'ral Tears! I Rue Thy Death! I must, My Father! Father! say, Our Chariots and our Horsemen where are they? I the dumb son of Crasus 'fore mine Eyes Have sett, and will cry when my Father dyes. Oh! but a Verse to wait upon thy Grave, A Verse our Custome, and thy Friends will have: And must I brue my Tears? ah! shall I fetter My Grief, by studying for to mourn in Metre? Must too my cloudy Sorrows rain in Tune, Distilling like the softly Showrs of June? Alas! My Ephialtes takes me! See't! I strive to run, but then I want my feet. What shall I do? Shall I go invocate The Muses to mine aid? No, That I hate! The Sweet New England-Poet rightly said, It is a most Unchristian Use and Trade Of Some that Christians would be thought. Mr. M. Wigglesworth, in Pref. to D. D. If I Call'd Help, the Muses mother Memory Would be enough: He that Remembers well The Use and Loss of Oakes, will grieve his fill. Ih'd rather pray, that Hee, in whose just Eyes The Death of his dear Saints most preciose is, And Hee who helped David to bewail His Jon'than, would not my Endeavours fail. A sprightly Effort of Poetick Fire Would e'en Transport mee to a mad Desire: How could I wish, Oh! that the nimble Sun Of thy short Life before thy Day was done Might backward Ten Degrees have moved! or Oh! that thy Corps might but have chanced for To have been buried near Elisha's bones! Oh! that the Hand which rais'd the Widows Song Would give thee to thy Friends again! But, Fy! That Passion's vain! To sob, Why didst thou dy? Is but an Irish Note: Death won't Restore His Stolen Goods till Time shall be no more. Shall I take what a Prologue Homer hath Lett mee Relate the Heavenly Powers Wrath? Or shall I rather join with Jeremie, And o're our great and good Josiah sigh, O that my Head were waters, and mine Eyes A fountain were, that Hadadrimmon's Cryes Might bubble from mee! O that Day and Night For the Slain of my People weep I might! Ah! Why delay I? Reader, step with mee, And what is for thee on Grief's Table see Memoria, PrÃ¦teritum is The Dish I call thee to: Come taste of this. Oakes was! Ah! miserable word! But what Hee was. Let Never, Never be forgot. Beleeve mee once, It were a worthy thing Of's Life and Worth a large Account to bring To publick View, for general Benefit. I would essay (with Leave, Good Reader) it, So far as feet will carry mee; but know it From first to last, Grief never made good Poet. Hee that lasht with a Rod could versify, Attain'd, and could pretend far more than I! Short was thy Life! Sweet Saint! &amp; quickly run Thy Race! Thy Work was, oh! how quickly done! Thy Dayes were (David's measure) but a Span; Five Tens of Years roll'd since thy Life began. Thus I remember a Greek Poet Rhimes, They whom God Loves are wont to dy betimes. Thus Whit'ker, Perkins, Preston, Men of Note, Ay! many such, Never to fifty got. And thus (Rachel New-England!) many Seers Have left us in the akme of their Years. Good Soul! Thy Jesus who did for thee dy, In Heaven longed for thy Company. And let thy Life be measur'd by thy Deeds, Not by thy Years; Non Annis, sed Factis vivunt mortales. Not with years, but with deeds do mortals live. Thy Age strait nothing needs. Divert, My Pen! Run through the Zodiac Of Oakes his Life: And cause I knowledge lack Of most Occurrents, let mee now and then Snatch at a Passage worthy of a Pen. Our Mother England, ev'n a Village there (Fuller, insert it!) did this Worthy bear.

Prompt Parts, and early Piety now made Men say of him, what once observers said Of great John Baptist, and of Ambrose too, To what an one will this strange Infant grow? Her Light and Cup did happy Harvard give Unto him; and from her he did receive His Two Degrees: (A double Honour to Thee (Harvard! Own it!) did by this accrue!)

He complyes: The Starr moves thither! There the Orator Continu'd charming sinful mortals for To close with a sweet Jesus: Oh! he woo'd, He Thundred: Oh! for their eternal good How did he bring the Promises, and how Did he discharge flashes of Ebal? Now Hee held Love's golden Scepter out before The Humble Soul; Now made the Trumpet roar Fire, Death, and Hell against Impenitent Desp'rates, untill hee made their hearts relent. There did hee merit Sibs's Motto, I Just like a Lamp, with lighting others dy. Pralucendo pereo. By lighting the way I am lost. Ah! like a Silk-worm, his own bowels went To serve his Hearers, while he soundly spent His Spirits in his Labours.

An ELEGY Upon the DEATH of Mrs. MARY BROWN; Who Dyed in Travail, (with her Unborn Child;) On Dec. 26. 1703.Ãtatis SuÃ¦ 35. Monopolizing HEE's, pretend no more Of Wit and Worth, to Hoard up all the store. The Females too grow Wise &amp; Good &amp; Great; Some such in happy Salem find a Seat. Beware, my Sex, lest Females Win the Day, And Shame Us with reviv'd Hybristica. Plutarch, Return to Life, and Write agen, Of Womens Virtues, to Upbraid the Men. When Vertuous Women are in Books Enroll'd, Let our bright MARY's Name and Fate be told. Of Glorious Women, O Great Hottinger, In thy brave Catalogue, make Room for her. America thanks Europe, and does boast Her sending such a Gem unto our Coast. Come hither, You that the fair Sex reproach; Confuted now, no more your Scandals broach. ONE rescues here the Fame of all the Sex; And will your Contradicted Envy Vex. With no Sett-Offs, but Truth in every Line, We do Delineate our Heroine. Grammar makes TRUTH, a SHEE; we shall with care Nothing but very Truth of Her declare. TRUTH, Thou shalt be my Muse, and first relate How MARY Shone first in her Virgin-State. To Learn or Do some Good thing every Day Was the Prime Study of this Agatha. Ambitious Early to Enjoy a Mind, From Earth, and Foggy Ignorance refin'd. A Bible, not Romance, her Eyes before, Then daily help'd her Heaven to implore. Tutors one never more obedient saw; Their Word, their very Look, She made her Law. To fill her Soul with high Attainments, Shee Gladly Out-Labour'd the Industrious Bee. No Hind Let Loose; but Guarded well, and grave; Most Goodly Words, yet our Eulalia gave. Not Confident; Like Damsels which their Chin. Contrive more than their Tongue, to Bridle in. Not of the Gadding Tribe; nor could She bear, So Chast! the least Indecent Thing to hear. With still a Silent Blush, her Rising Blood Spoke in her Face, Care to be very Good. Pale with the Fear of doing ill, and Red With Modesty, was all the Paint She had. Go on, dear TRUTH, charge once Truth-Speaking Fame To Tell whose Wife, &amp; What She then became. BROWN to the Lottery of Worth drew near; He drew a Prize, a matchless Prize, in Her. Not Wealth, but Solid Worth, in her he sees; He see's Rich Vertues, and is charm'd with these. O Parents, Pity the fond Sons of Men, And your fair Daughters well adorn for them. With Useful Knowledge fraight their Tender Souls; Why should they Empty be, but Noisy Fools? Teach them the Skill an House to Guide &amp; Feed, And with Kind Mates and Easy Life to Lead. Goodness to them, and all Good Humour Show; The Pious Parents Shap'd their MARY so. The Wretch that is alone to Mammon Wed, May chance to find a Satan in the Bed. She's Rich! That's all they say on her behalf: Her Gold you Worship, and a Golden Calf. Wink hard and Wed; a Bag and Baggage too, In Markets often do together go. Who by meer Hundreds and by Thousands choose, A Thousand tis to One, themselves they loose. The Rigging of the Ship; the Tear &amp; Wear, Will soon cost more than all She brought with her. Why should her Dress Ensnare? Tis dearly bought: Poor Woodcocks that are in a Ribbon caught. Or why her Dance bewitch? Upon an head Not like John Baptists, her Light Feet shall tread. BROWN Steer'd not so; He ask'd, A Vertuous Wife, The Soul, and Salt, and Joy of Humane Life. A Vertuous Wife, Heav'n did on BROWN bestow; So Heav'n Rewards its Favourites below. A Wife indeed! Which now so few attain, Some are so; and thou MARY in the Van. Happy the Women were, and Happy too The Husbands, if the Sex were more like YOU. Oh! Would they Carriage from your Conduct learn; Be Neat; but make their Soul, their main concern. Her BROWN, how did She Love, &amp; please &amp; prize; And Saw none but that Covering of her Eyes! The Persian Law, She would not Alter too, That Wives give to their Husbands Honour due. Blame not the Rabbi's now for what they Write, How Heav'n did Adam and Eve, at first Unite. Two Bodies then if Heav'n in One did frame, Two Souls here met in One united Flame. Sir, Tho' you Cloath'd her as you Lov'd her, well, She would of You, more than her Cloathing tell. So Philo's Wife, with mean Array Content, Her Husbands Worth, call'd Her best Ornament. Had you been Lame, She'd been the Herpine, who In Arms a Thousand Miles had carried You. Or had it been your Hap to first Expire, She had felt more than Portia's Coals of Fire. When did She ever once your Patience try, Or make an Head-Ake in the Family! Yes, Once at Last; She did your Love offend; T'was by her Death; but never, Sir, till then! Martyr of Love to You, Lov'd Rachel Dyed; And what must now dear BENJAMIN betide? How many means black Death at once to kill? She felt Two Death's, and YOU a Thousand feel. BROWN and his Bride with Vertuous Love display How Christ does Love, and how his Church obey. Why did'st thou Father Jerom, say, that Strife Must be Essential to the Married Life? Here was a pair, the only Strife of whom Was who should in their Goodness overcome. Oh come, Tertullian; Teach me to declare, The Happiness of such an Happy Pair! Ye Popish Dogs, At Marriage bark no more; Unclean so Devils burn, and Single Roar. Marriage, That Honourable Chastity, Let none but Filthy Antichrist decry. But tell, fair TRUTH; for thou hast more to tell: What MARY was; Not, where's a Parallel! Her Beauty let Agrippa's Pen define: Call it, A Lovely Ray of Light Divine; A Soul of Heav'nly Lustre Shining thro' An Earthly Lanthorn of a Glorious hue. A Body of a Frame so fine and Rare, When was there Matter seen to Thought so near? (So Fair; but not Enslav'd unto the Smoke Pip'd by the Dames under the Indian Yoke!) But NOYES, except Thou do a Pencil find, None can Paint out the Beauty of her Mind. Unbodied Vertue She; The Spangled Sphere Look'd for her, and such Lustre must be there. A Patch'd Face could not suit so sound an Heart, Spotts to the Skin clear Souls do not impart. Sincere; She Paint abhorr'd; a Jezabel May Paint, but Meat unto the Doggs she fell. Prudence the Mother of all Vertues here, Before She was a Mother came to Her. The Harmless Dove nothing of Serpent had, But Prudence for to serve and help her Head. By the Polestar of Piety She Steer'd; And no mishaps but those of Sin She fear'd. When JESUS call'd, His Mary came to Him, Clasping the Feet that came her to Redeem. With Tears to Channels of Repentance turn'd, Faults known to none but Heav'n &amp; Her, She mourn'd. And yet these Lovely Pearls, her Tears, She thought Must to her Saviours Cleansing Blood be brought. The Worlds base Idols, her brave Soul despis'd And what the World Adores She Sacrific'd. CHRIST ask'd the Heart of Her for whom He dy'd; Great LORD, I'm thine! Her conquer'd Heart reply'd. His Righteousness alone She chose for that Wherein to Stand before His Judgment Seat: To that Kind Shepherd, gladly She Resign'd To Lead and Rule by Grace her Lamb-like Mind. Her Hands to God oft Lift in fervent Prayer, (Hands in Redeeming Blood well Whit'ned) were. When the rare Pastors had their Sermons done, Her Doing was, the Repetition. Banquets not in the Hall, but at the Door She still preferr'd, there for to feed the Poor. Her old Cloaths, on the Poor, a Neater Shew She judg'd, they made than on her Self her New. Ye Writers on the Decalogue, Stand by; Durham and all the rest, shall Needless ly: The Life we saw our pious MARY Live, A Commentary to the Life, did give. But Oh! the Fourth!âTell, How She Sabbatiz'd; And how the Rapt'rous Day She spent and priz'd. The Day of God, which all our other Dayes As worth Ten Thousand of them all, do praise; The Day which all Enlightned minds confess, The Day-break of Eternal Blessedness; The Day; Incomparable Day; so fair None among all Times flying Children are: The Map of Heaven, the Light of Earth, or which God from Deep Treasures does our Souls Enrich. She Lov'd the Day, She Lov'd the LORD, of whom The Day proclaim'd his Rising from the Tomb. MARY this Day knew what it was to have Joy in a JESUS Rising from the Grave. Bright Day, Thou Soul of Piety; we see All True Religion Lives or Dyes with thee. My Heroine saw this, and kept the Day; This was, or None, She saw, to Heav'n the way. Vain Things Lay by; but with a Zealous Heart, Now MARY chose and sought the Better part. So on THIS DAY at last She must Expire, And to a Sacred Rest with CHRIST Retire. The Seventh and the Sacred Day, the Dove Takes for her Flight unto the Ark above. O Chrysostom, Revoke thy gross Abuse; How could a Golden Mouth such Dross produce? A WOMAN, as True Friendships Enemy, True Evil but Good painted, to decry? What Mother had the Father op'ning thus? Or was he but a TerrÃ¦ Filius? An Admirable MARY does refute The Clamour, and strike Ev'ry Satyr mute. But stay; Bold Quill; Touch not that String too Long Lest Length may do at Length her Vertue wrong. Who knew her need no Verse of mine; for they Know more than my Imperfect Verse can say. Who knew her not, will vainly think that none Can say beyond that which by me was known. My Pen so Silenc'd will by Silence speak It self to Celebrate her Praise too weak. Tell only What's her Fate, or, That She's Dead; Twill be impossible then to proceed. A BIRTH of One, to Both a Death becomes; A Breathless Mother the Dead Child Entomb's. Sad Fate! But for another BIRTH we wait: She and her Infant, will be Twins in That. With Tears that cannot stop, till then we must Behold a Diamond Lying in the Dust. A Lacrymatory: Design'd for the Tears let fall at the Funeral of Mrs. SARAH LEVERET; Who Dy'd 2d. 11 M. 1704,5. Flow on, Just Tears, and let such Dues be paid: Tears were at first, for these Occasions made. Long did I Vex in Vain at Stupid Man, That e're Men found out Painting, so long Ages ran. Fain would I Painted to the Life have seen The Heroines that in past Times have been. O could we Present that bright SARAH View, Who Mortals charm'd, and who pleas'd Angels too. Or that brave MIRIAM, She of whom tis said, The Israels Daughters in Devotions Led: Could glorious DEBORAH appear agen, And to true Glory Quicken Slothful Men: Could Prayerful Hannah once again be shown, Prostrate in Prayer's before the Sapphire Throne: Could Pious MARY with her inward worth, And all her Piety again come forth: We'd Love the Painter, and admire the skill; But tis our Grief, we want that Painting Still. And courteous Dorcas, we complain of Thee We can't thy Face wrought with thy Needle see. But now there is an end of all complaints; ONE Matron gives a sight of all the Saints. Our LEV'RET is of all a curious Draught: Oh! what an one! by what fine Pencil wrought So on one Cherry-Stone, true Fame avers, Vienna showes an Hundred Pourtraiters. So Hamborough does of an Agate tell, Where Europes Princely Faces all do dwell. The Siamese their Golden Image prize Whose Price does to Twelve Million Livres rise. VIRTUE a Nobler Image did Erect In our Incomparable LEVERET. Vain Jews, The Palaces no more Divide Where Holy Women do in Heav'n reside: Four PrÃ¦sidents assign to them no more; Or say, a Fifth's now added to the Four. She shall be Ours on Earth at least; and we By this our HULDAH will directed be. You, Ladies, that were Tutoresses to The Ancient Sages, did, what she shall do. âO VIRGINS worthy of the Zodiack, Love âThose Objects first and most, that are Above. âBe first Espous'd unto the mighty LORD, âOn Terms propos'd in his most Sacred Word. âWalk not with them whose Folly leads to Hell; âBy awful Modesty rude Fools repell. âLet not Vile Books your blooming years deprave, âBut Books of Grace let your perusal have. âRather to Churches than to Balls repair; âPerfume you Closets too with Daily Prayer. âFoul Cards let your Fair Hands throw by with Scorn âBut Write and Work as for high purpose born. âLet pearly Tears (at which lewd wretches scoff) âOf Penitence wash your Black Patches off. Dress well; Flant not too high; nor Change too fast. Wear what shall speak you Sober, Wise and Chast, And in a Body clad with comely Dress, Soul drest with rich Robes of Righteousness. Thus did our admirable SARAH: Thus Of Virgin-Grace a mould she left for us. Her Matchless Merits now prepared her To be a Match for a great GOVERNOUR. Him Sarah call'd Her Lord: Himself to please She sought: And saw none but her Tygranes. The Colony in her sweet carriage saw What made in every House a Persian Law. A Wife so lovely, so discreet and kind; How Bles'd of God, the Man that shall her find! Rise up, Her Daughters, and with Grace Repeat, How she did You with constant Wisdom treat. Do what she did for You; And still Retain What she gave You of Tincture in the Grain. O Happy Chickens! [Those we Happy sing;] Whom such a Dam warms with her Tender Wing. She must a Widow too Example give How in a Patient Widow-Hood to live. Dead her Patricius Twenty years and five, Deathless did in his moaning Dove Survive. Her Maker now she did her Husband make: Such Souls in Him can full contentment take. With Famous Women let our SARAH claim For best endowments an Immortal Name. Hippatia taught of old the Liberal Arts: But Ours the Art of managing our Hearts. Eudoxia Glosses on the Bible wrote; But Ours a Gloss in her pure practice brought. Rosuida wrote the Lives of worthy Men: Ours liv'd one Worthy to be wrote by them. With Zealous Visits to the House of God, A mansion there she chose for her Abode. Her Fervent Zeal would overcome the Cold: No Storms from Coming there could her withold. Ye, Men of God, Your Funeral-Sermons owe For Her who Sermons those Regards did show. You have in Her an Auditory gone, A Full one t'was, if she were there Alone. Good Lady, Tell us now that Secret Rare; Rare like the Stone of the Philosopher: A Life of Ten Times Seven Years to run. And all that while to be Reproach'd by None. None You Reproach'd, But every Person knew What Good You could, You'd every Person do There Madam, lay Your Skill: By Goodness tis We charm fell Serpents, that they cannot hiss. Till grown for Earth too Good, on Earth she grew Heav'n claim'd her then: and then to Heav'n she flew. Luxurious Death; such Pearls to Swallow thus! Fam'd Cleopatra's Draught was less profuse. You rash Astronomers, the Stars miscall, A Dog you style the brightest of them all. Correct an Error which You find so Great; Your Sirius now shall be a LEVERET. Else the most Fulgid Lamp, which Heav'n did show And then took in an Hundred Years ago, Now She's got there, will once again appear, And radiant Sit in Cassiopea's Chair. Lacrymatories, which Reserv'd of old Tears for the Dead, were Viols (as we're told:) Our LEVERET is Lost; we'l Weep for her Tears that shall fill the Tun of Heidelbergh. On the GRAVES, OF MY Young Brethren, [Carent quia vate Sacro.] Because they lack a sacred poet. Graves! Where in Dust are laid our dearest Hopes! Pay, Passengers, your Tributary Drops. Your Tears Allow'd, yea, Hallowed now become, Since Tears were drop't by JESUS on a Tomb. Churches, Weep on; &amp; Wounded yield your Tears; Tears use to flow from hack't New-English Firrs. Zion, Thy Sons are gone; Tho' men might see This and that Man, brave Men, were born in thee. Tell, what they were; Let thy True Trumpet tell Truth of the Sons of Truth, and how they fell. Sure, when our Sev'n did to their Seats retire, Th' Harmonious Nine did not with them expire. Smooth Numbers first were form'd for Themes like these; T' immortalize deserving Memories. First, What they were not, Say; for they were Not Such as their Mother might account a Blot. Not such as to the Sacred Priest-hood fly, Meerly as to a Craft, to Live thereby. Not, who at Church seem Serious and Demure, But out of it, no Strictness can Endure. Not those who dare Jest with Gods awful Word And Lewdly can Play with the Flaming Sword. Not the Black Folks, where nothing White we know But what an Open'd Mouth may chance to show. Not Snuffs, instead of Stars; (the Room, no doubt, Would Sweeter be, if Such were turned out.) Not Blind-men, [So the Talmuds reckon them!] Who Dark themselves, hold Lights to other men. Not Lads, whom for their Levity alone The Punning Tribe, De Tribu Levi, own. Not who to Pulpits hop Unfledg'd, and there Talk twice a Week, and Preach not once a year. Not those who do the Pious Neighbour Shun, But to the Wicked Sons of Belial run. Not those who hate their Work, as Boyes the Rod, And hate and flout Laborious Men of God. If such there are; Take, Lord, thy Holy Scourge, And from such Nusances, thy Temple Purge! Not such my Sons; by Zion so we're told; Sons comparable to the Finest Gold. But, What they were, Fair Lady, canst thou say, What thy Lost Seven, and not faint away! For with her Seven Sons, and such as these, Dy'd the brave Mother of the Maccabees. Mirrours of Piety they were, and knew Betimes, how to be Wise and Good and True. Early the Larks Praise to their Maker Sung; So Saint Macarius, Old while very Young. The Towns to which they did their Toyls dispense, Them their Bright Glory thought, &amp; Strong Defence. The Tears of their Bereaved Flocks Proclame More than could Marble Pyramids their Name. These were N. Englands Pride; But Humbly Show'd Men might be so, and not themselves be Proud. Dryden Sayes, Look the Reformation round, No Treatise of Humility is found. Dryden, Thou Ly'st; They Write, and more than so. They Live Humility; they can be low. Low these were always in their own Esteem, But the more highly we Esteemed them. Low-roof'd the Temples, but more Stately than St. Sophy's, built by Great Justinian, The Proud might trample on them as on Earth, But glorious Mines of Worth lay underneath. First they did all to Kiriath-Sepher go; And then a Church did Heav'n on them bestow. By Learning first their Lamps were made to Blaze; And Incense each then on the Altar layes. The Liberal Arts they knew; but understood Most Thine, Great Antonine; That, [To be Good.] And Good to Do, This was their main Delight; For This they did all Youths vain Pleasure Sleight. While such rare Youths must Dy, no Lawyers wit (Not Asgils) can abate Death's Fatal Writ. Must such see but a Finger of the Span That is to measure the Frail Life of man! Yet we'l demand Eternity for them; And they shall Live too in Eternal Fame. Reckon, O Jews, your Priestly Blemishes, Forty above an Hundred, if you please: A Priest for each of these did lose his call; But Ours to all appear'd still free from all. The Power of your fine Loadstones, wondrous Great, Report, ye Masters of the Cabinet: Loadstones in weight a Dram; well-Shodden they Pull up what near Two Hundred Drams will weigh. Our Potent Loadstones more attractive were; And more the Sphere of their Activity extended far. Now, Pancirol, upon my honest Word, The Lost Sepulchral Lamps, are Now Restor'd. Our Saints, to whom do Serve as Oyl, our Tears, Bright Lamps, they glare still in their Sepulchres. My CLARK was One. And such a Clark as he Synods of Angels would take Theirs to be. Faintly to Praise a Youth of such Desert, Were but to Shoot indeed vile Slanders Dart. See but his Wasted Flesh; T'was Flaming Zeal That Melted him: The Flame is burning still. Methinks I see his Ravish'd Hearers wait And long to hear still his next Heav'nly Treat. Look; The Fat Cloud, what Oracles he pours On Thirsty Souls in most Expedient Showres! His Preaching much, but more his Practice wrought A Living Sermon of the Truths he Taught. So all might See the Doctrines which they Heard, And way to Application fairly clear'd. Strong were the Charms of that Sinceritie Which made his Works well with his Words agree. Painter, Thy Pencils take. Draw first, a Face Shining, (but by himself not seen) with Grace. An Heav'n touch'd Eye, where [what of Kens is told] One might, MY GOD, in Capitals behold. A Mouth, from whence a Label shall proceed, And [O LOVE CHRIST] the Motto to be Read. An Hand still open to relieve the Poor, And by Dispersing to increase the Store. Such was my CLARK; so did he Look, and so Much more than Look, or Speak, so did he Do. Botanists, Boast your Palm-Tree, whence arise More than Three Hundred rich Commodities. Write, Persian Poet, that brave Tree to Praise, As many Songs as in the year be Dayes. My CLARK more Vertues had; So must the Tree Too rich for Earth, to Heav'n transplanted be. HUBBARD Another. When the Youth they saw, So Wise, Their Love he challeng'd, &amp; their Awe. Older Spectators fed their wondring Eyes, With Love, to see Young Children grow so Wise. Envy her self grew weary of her Gall, And gave Consent, he should be Lov'd by all. The Pastoral of Gregory the Great, Won't Say how well he fill'd the Pastors Seat. In Saving Souls his Happy Hours he spent, And Preach'd Salvation wheresoe're he went. A Cassius, whom the Hearers did attend, With constant Fear, that he would make an End. His Life a Letter, where the World might Spell Great Basils Morals, and his Death the Seal. The Graces which were Sparks on Earth below, To Glorious Flames in Heav'n they now do grow. Oh! Should a Star drop from the Sky to us, We should with Reverence admire it thus! For such a Child of Jacob there Unite Th' Egyptian Weeping with the Israelite. So has his After-Beams the Setting Sun; Tho' he be Set, his Splendor is not gone. Adieu, My CLARK, my HUBBARD, thus Adieu; A Pair well Parallel'd we had in you. Grave Plutarch, Hadst thou Liv'd till now, the Pair Would have Engross'd thy Pen, they Look so fair. Such Gifts as these, by Heav'n bestow'd on Men, Must just be Show'n, and then call'd back agen! Lord, Why so soon, such Fruitful Trees cut down! No Wood of Such, was on the Altar known. Trees not cut down, [the Glorious Answer is,] But all Translated into Paradise. From the Quick Seizure of the greedy Grave Her Darling Sons my Country cannot Save. But, Grave, Thou shalt not so thy Prey consume, As ever Buried in Oblivions Womb. Thus Thetis Comforted her Short-Liv'd Son, Dy Young, Long shalt thou be Admir'd when Dead &amp; Gone. One of the Pleiades long since withdrew. And Heav'n but Six, does of the Seven shew. If all the rest should chance to hide their Face, My Seven Stars may well Supply their Place. Now, hold, my Pen; Plato of old would have But Four Heroick Lines upon a Grave. Help me, my God, at Work like them to be; And take their Deaths as Watch-words unto me. Ex Paulini Panegyrico in Obitum Celsi. Heu, quid agam? Dubia Pendens Pietate Laboro, Gratuler an Doleam? Dignus utroque Puer. Cujus Amor Lacrymas et Amor mihi Gaudia Suadet; Sed Gaudere Fides, Flere jubet Pietas. Tam Modicum Patribus, tam dulci e pigmore Fructum Defleo in Exiguo Temporis esse datum. LÃ¦tor Obisse brevi functum Mortalia Seclo, Ut cito divinas Consequeretur Opes. From the Panegyric of Paulinus on the Death of Celsus. The Latin may be translated:Oh what shall I do? With wavering piety I am troubled considering, Should I give thanks or grieve? The boy is deserving of both. Love for him moves me to tears and joy; But Faith orders me to rejoice, Piety to weep. So moderate a profit from so sweet a pledge I bewail in the small extent of time has been given to the fathers. I rejoice that he, who suffered his mortal trials in a brief lifetime, died. That he might quickly obtain divine riches. GRATITUDINIS ERGO, An ESSAY on the Memory of my Venerable MASTER; Ezekiel Cheever. Augusto perstringere Carmine Laudes, Quas nulla Eloquij vis Celebrare queat. To bind with an august song praises, Which no power of eloquence is able to honor. You that are Men &amp; Thoughts of Manhood know, Be Just now to the Man that made you so. Martyred by Scholars the stabb'd Cassian dies. And falls to cursed Lads a Sacrifice. Not so my CHEEVER; Not by Scholars slain, But Prais'd, and Lov'd, and wish'd to Life again. Almighty Tribe of Well-instructed Youth Tell what they owe to him, and Tell with Truth. All the Eight parts of Speech he taught to them They now Employ to Trumpet his Esteem. They fill Fames Trumpet, and they spread a Fame To last till the Last Trumpet drown the same. Magister pleas'd them well, because 'twas he; They saw that Bonus did with it agree. While they said, Amo, they the Hint improve Him for to make the Object of their Love. No Concord so Inviolate they knew As to pay Honours to their Master due. With Interjections they break off at last, But, Ah, is all they use, Wo, and, Alas! We Learnt Prosodia, but with that Design Our Masters Name should in our Verses shine. Our Weeping Ovid but instructed us To write upon his Death, De Tristibus. Tully we read, but still with this Intent, That in his praise we might be Eloquent. Our Stately Virgil made us but Contrive As our Anchises to keep him Alive, When PhÃ¦nix to Achilles was assign'd A Master, then we thought not Homer blind. A PhÃ¦nix, which Oh! might his Ashes shew! So rare a Thing we thought our Master too. And if we made a Theme, 'twas with Regret We might not on his Worth show all our Wit. Go on, ye Grateful Scholars, to proclame To late Posterity your Masters Name. Let it as many Languages declare As on Loretto-Table do appear. Too much to be by any one exprest: I'll tell my share, and you shall tell the rest. Ink is too vile a Liquor; Liquid Gold Should fill the Pen, by which such things are told. The book should Amyanthus-Paper be All writ with Gold, from all corruption free. A Learned Master of the Languages Which to Rich Stores of Learning are the Keyes; He taught us first Good Sense to understand And put the Golden Keyes into our Hand, We but for him had been for Learning Dumb, And had a sort of Turkish Mutes become. Were Grammar quite Extinct, yet at his Brain The Candle might have well been lit again. If Rhet'rick had been stript of all her Pride She from his Wardrobe might have been Supply'd. Do but Name CHEEVER, and the Echo straight Upon that Name, Good Latin, will Repeat. A Christian Terence, Master of the File That arms the Curious to Reform their Style. Now Rome and Athens from their Ashes rise; See their Platonick Year with vast surprise: And in our School a Miracle is Wrought; For the Dead Languages to Life are brought. His Work he Lov'd: Oh! had we done the same: Our Play-dayes still to him ungrateful came. And yet so well our Work adjusted Lay, We came to Work, as if we came to Play. Our Lads had been, but for his wondrous Cares, Boyes of my Lady Mores unquiet Pray'rs. Sure were it not for such informing Schools, Our Lat'ran too would soon be fill'd with Owles. Tis CORLET's pains, &amp; CHEEVER's, we must own, That thou, New-England, art not Scythia grown. The Isles of Silly had o're-run this Day The Continent of our America. Grammar he taught, which 'twas his work to do: But he would Hagar have her place to know. The Bible is the Sacred Grammar, where The Rules of speaking well, contained are. He taught us Lilly, and he Gospel taught; And us poor Children to our Saviour brought. Master of Sentences, he gave us more Then we in our Sententia had before. We Learn't Good Things in Tullies Offices; But we from him Learn't Better things than these. With Cato's he to us the Higher gave Lessons of JESUS, that our Souls do save. We Constru'd Ovid's Metamorphosis, But on our selves charg'd, not a Change to miss. Young Austin wept, when he saw Dido dead, Tho' not a Tear for a Lost Soul he had: Our Master would not let us be so vain, But us from Virgil did to David train, Textors Epistles would not Cloathe our Souls; Pauls too we heard; we went to School at Pauls. Syrs, Do you not Remember well the Times, When us he warn'd against our Youthful Crimes: What Honey dropt from our old Nestors mouth When with his Counsels he Reform'd our Youth: How much he did to make us Wise and Good; And with what Prayers, his work he did conclude. Concern'd, that when from him we Learning had, It might not Armed Wickedness be made! The Sun shall first the Zodiac forsake, And Stones unto the Stars their Flight shall make: First shall the Summer bring large drifts of Snow, And beauteous Cherries in December grow; E're of those Charges we Forgetful are Which we, O man of God, from thee did hear. Such Tutors to the Little Ones would be Such that in Flesh we should their Angels see, Ezekiel should not be the Name of such; We'd Agathangelus not think too much, Who Serv'd the School, the Church did not forget, But Thought, and Pray'd, and often wept for it. Mighty in Prayer: How did he wield thee, Pray'r! Thou Reverst Thunder: CHRIST's-Sides-piercing Spear? Soaring we saw the Birds of Paradise; So Wing'd by Thee, for Flights beyond the Skies. How oft we saw him tread the Milky Way, Which to the Glorious Throne of Mercy lay! Come from the Mount, he shone with ancient Grace. Awful the Splendor of his Aged Face Cloath'd in the Good Old Way, his Garb did wage A War with the Vain Fashions of the Age. Fearful of nothing more than hateful Sin; 'Twas that from which he laboured all to win, Zealous; And in Truths Cause ne'r known to trim; No Neuter Gender there allow'd by him. Stars but a Thousand did the Ancients know; On later Globes they Nineteen hundred grow: Now such a CHEEVER added to the Sphere; Makes an Addition to the Lustre there. Mean time America a Wonder saw; A Youth in Age, forbid by Natures Law. You that in t'other Hemisphere do dwell, Do of Old Age your dismal Stories tell. You tell of Snowy Heads and Rheumy Eyes And things that make a man himself despise. You say, a frozen Liquor chills the Veins, And scarce the Shadow of a Man remains. Winter of Life, that sapless Age you call, And of all Maladies the Hospital The Second Nonage of the Soul; the Brain Cover'd with Cloud; the Body all in pain. To weak Old Age, you say, there must belong A Trembling Palsey both of Limb and Tongue; Dayes all Decrepit, and a Bending Back, Propt by a Staff, in Hands that ever Shake. Nay, Syrs, our CHEEVER shall confute you all, On whom there did none of these Mischefs fall. He Liv'd, and to vast Age no Illness knew; 'Till Time's Scythe waiting for him Rusty grew. He Liv'd and Wrought, His Labour's were Immense; But ne'er Declin'd to PrÃ¦ter-perfect Tense. A Blooming Youth in him at Ninety Four We saw; But, Oh! when such a sight before! At Wondrous Age he did his Youth resume, As when the Eagle mew's his Aged plume. With Faculties of Reason still so bright And at Good Services so Exquisite Sure our sound Chiliast, we wondring thought, To the First Ressurection is not brought! No, He for That was waiting at the Gate In the Pure Things that fit a Candidate. He in Good Actions did his Life Employ, And to make others Good, he made his Joy. Thus well-appris'd now of the Life to Come, To Live here was to him a Martyrdom: Our brave Macrobius Long'd to see the Day Which others dread, of being Call'd away. So, Ripe with Age, he does invite the Hook Which watchful does for its large Harvest look. Death gently cut the Stalk, and kindly laid Him, where our God His Granary has made. Who at New-Haven first began to Teach, Dying Unshipwreck'd, does White-Haven reach. At that Fair Haven they all Storms forget; He there his DAVENPORT with Love does meet. The Luminous Robe, the Loss whereof with Shame Our Parents wept, when Naked they became; Those Lovely Spirits wear it, and therein Serve God with Priestly Glory, free from Sin. But in his Paradisian Rest above, To Us does the Blest Shade retain his Love. With Rip'ned Thoughts Above concern'd for Us, We can't but hear him dart his Wishes, thus. âTUTORS, Be Strict; But yet be Gentle too: âDon't by fierce Cruelties fair Hopes undo. âDream not, that they who are to Learning slow, âWill mend by Arguments in Ferro. âWho keeps the Golden Fleece, Oh, let him not âA Dragon be, tho' he Three Tongues have got. âWhy can you not to Learning find the way, âBut thro' the Province of Severia? âTwas Moderatus, who taught Origen; âA Youth which prov'd one of the Best of men. âThe Lads with Honour first, and Reason Rule; âBlowes are but for the Refractory Fool. âBut, Oh! First Teach them their Great God to fear; âThat you like me, with joy may meet them here. He has said! Adieu, a little while, Dear Saint, Adieu; Your Scholar won't be Long, Sir, after you. In the mean time, with Gratitude I must Engrave an EPITAPH upon your Dust. 'Tis true, Excessive Merits rarely safe: Such an Excess forfeits an Epitaph. But if Base men the Rules of Justice break, The Stones (at least upon the Tombs) will speak. Et Tumulum facite, et Tumulo superaddite carmen. And make a sepulchral mound, and add upon the mound a song. (Virgil) (Virg. in Daphn.) EPITAPHIUM. EZEKIEL CHEEVERUS. Ludimagister: Primo Neo-portensis; Deinde, Ipsuicensis; Postea, Carolotenensis Postremo, Bostonensis cujus Doctrinam ac Virtutem Nosti, si Sis Nov-Anglus, Colis, si non Barbarus; GRAMMATICUS, a Quo, non pure tantum, sed et pie, Loqui; RHETORICUS, a Quo non tantum Ornate dicere coram Hominibus, Sed et Orationes coram Deo fundere Efficacissimas; POETA, a Quo non tantum Carmina pangere, Sed et CÃ¦lestes Hymnos, Odasq; Angelicas, canere, Didicerunt, Qui discere voluerunt; LUCERNA, ad Quam accensa sunt, Quis queat numerare, Quot Ecclesiarum Lumina? Qui secum Corpus TheologiÃ¦ abstulit, Peritissimus THEOLOGUS, Corpus hic suum sibi minus Charum, deposuit. Vixit Annos, XCIV. Docuit, Annos, LXX. Obijt, A.D. M. DCC. VIII. Et quod Mori potuit, HEIC Expectet Exoptatq: Primam Sanctorum Ressurectionem ad Immortalitatem. Evuvijs debetur Honos Immortalitatem primam. The Latin may be translated: Epitaph Ezekiel Cheever Schoolmaster First of New-Haven; Then of Ispwich; After of Charlestown Last of Boston whose Learning and Virtue You know, if you be a New Englander, You honor, if you be not a foreigner; GRAMMARIAN, from whom talk is not only pure but also pious; RHETORICIAN from whom speech is elegant not only to men in public but he also showers Most effective speeches on God in public POET from whom not only songs are composed But he also Sings Celestial hymns and angelic odes, They learn, Who wish to learn; A LAMP for whom has been kindled Who can count How many lights of the Churches? AND He carried off the corpus of Theology with him Most experienced THEOLOGIAN, He placed his own body less dear to him. He lived 94 years. He taught 70 years. He died in 1708 A.D. And because he is able to die, He awaits and desires The first resurrection of the holy ones for Immortality. Honor is owed first Immortality. EPITAPH DUMMER, the Shephard Sacrific'd By Wolves, because the Sheep he Priz'd; The Orphans Father, Churches Light, The Love of Heaven, of Hell the Spite; The Countreyes Gapman, and the Face That Shone, but Knew it not, with Grace. DUMMER, a Wise man of the East, Gone to see JESUS, in His Rest: Hunted by Divels, but Reliev'd By Angels, and on High Reciev'd: The Martyr'd Pelican, who Bled, Rather than Leave the Saints Unfed, DUMMER, the Bird of Paradise, Shot, and Flown thither in a trice; Methus'la Dead, from whence our Flood, Threefold of Tears &amp; Fears &amp; Blood; HERE Left his Ashes, and we see, Gods Temple thus in Ashes!â LORD, Hear the Cry of Righteous DUMMERS Wounds, Under thine Altar; Lord, Rate off those Hounds That Worry thus thy Flocks: And let the Bones Of thine ELISHA, over whom our Moans Are Sigh'd, Inspire the Life of Zeal into The Rest, that have a Work, Like His to Do. The Excellent WIGGLESWORTH, Remembred by some Good Tokens. HIS Pen did once Meat from the Eater fetch; And now he's gone beyond the Eaters reach. His Body, once so Thin, was next to None; From Thence, he's to Unbodied Spirits flown. Once his rare skill did all Diseases heal; And he does nothing now uneasy feel. He to his Paradise is Joyful come; And waits with Joy to see his Day of Doom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Part Three: Verse for Children [I.] Little Children Brought unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST. On Mat. XIX. 14. When Little Children once were brought To our most Gracious Lord: Them that Oppos'd, He better Taught, By this most precious Word: âSuffer Your Little Children, so, âForbid them not, I say, âTheir Saviour to come unto; âI'm He, and come they may. âAcknowledge me a mighty King, âThat Heavenly Graces give; âInfants to me, for Subjects bring; âMy Heaven does them receive. Thus does our Blessed Shepherd call, Our lambs into His Fold: Lord pour thy Blessings on them all, Blessings richer than Gold. Oh! What a Glorious Grace is This, Which God through Christ will grant, That HE ours and our Childrens is, In His Best Covenant. [II.] Early Religion. 1 King. XVIII. O That while I am Young I might Fear the most Glorious One; And not my Great Redeemer Slight: Thine, Lord; I'm THINE alone.2 Chron. 34-3. May I while I am very Young, Seek unto God by Prayer: And those Lov'd Ones be found among That Early Seekers are: Psal. 119.9. May I, while I am Young, give Heed Unto thy Holy Word; Call'd, there to Cleanse my wayes with Speed, By the most Holy Lord. 2 Joh. 4. Though I am yet a Child, I wou'd In my most Forward Youth, Walk, by the conduct of my God, In the pure paths of Truth. 2 Tim. 2.22. Those Lusts that Youthful are, to me May they most Hateful prove; And may the Laws of JESUS be My Sweetest Joy and Love. Eccl. 12.1. Lord, THEE, my Maker, Thee, To Day, God, Father, Son, and Spirit, I would Remember, that I may Eternal Life Inherit. [III.] The Consent of the Believer unto the Ten Commandments. LORD, I should have no Lord, beside Thee, to be Lov'd, Serv'd, Glorify'd. I should the Glory due to Thee, In Wayes, pay, that Appointed be. Thy Names, Thy Words, Thy Works, I should, Sacred for proper Uses, hold. The Dayes which thou made Sacred hath, I should not in Diversions wast. In their Fit places, every one, I should with all Fit Honours own. That Life none may unjustly Loose, Means I should with all kindness use. Chast I should be in every part, Yea, Chast in every Thought of Heart. To Get and Keep my Worldly Wealth, I should commit no sort of Stealth. Truth I should utter, and maintain, And no Good Name with Slander stain. With sweet Content I should Receive All the Wise God will please to give. Lord, By the Blood of CHRIST, I pray, Save me, who do not thus obey; And by the Strength of CHRIST, from hence, Sav'd, Let me yield Obedience. [IV.] The Lords Prayer. Our Father, in the Heavenly Throne, Inclin'd from thence to Help us all; For the Sake of thy Blessed Son, Thy Children thus upon Thee Call. We would thy Ever-glorious Name, As Holy, with Great Fear Adore: And wish that All may in the same, Thy Holy One Praise Evermore. May thy Just Kingdom Come, we Pray That thou art the Worlds King, we know: But, Oh! bring on that Happy Day, When all the World shall own Thee so. May we thy Righteous Will approve, And it all Things commanding see, As it in the New Heaven above, And the New Earth below, shall be. Lord, Give us a Convenient Food; What may be Such, to Thee we leave, And let us not want any Good; All we Rely on Thee to give. Our Faults, by which we are in Debt To Thy dread Justice, Lord, Release: Christ Payes our Debt; And we Forget, For this, our Neighbours Injuries. We're Frail; Us from Temptation Save; Sins, Oh! Sins, The worst Evils are: Us Let not Evil Tempters have, And hold in any Sinful Snare. Thou hast the Rule of All; A Word Of thine can Do All: To Thee then All Honour's due: We Shout, O Lord, AMEN, in Faith of thy, AMEN! [V.] The Lords-Day. On Rev. I. 10. This is the Day of Rest, whereon Our Lord Rose from the Dead; The Price of mans Redemption, This Day was fully paid. This is to us, the Joyful Day, Which our Lord made His own, By his most Wonderful Display Of Pow'r and Grace thereon. The Jewish Sabbath Laid Asleep With our Lord under Earth, Directs us Now This Day to keep Of our Lords Second Birth. This is the Day, our Lord now chose Thereon still to Appear; The Day, for Him preferr'd by Those That His Apostles were. It is Declar'd, The Lords-Day, Now, Holy unto the Lord It will no Worldly Thought allow, No Worldly Work or Word. Now, Lord, on this Thy Day, dispence, Thy Spirit unto me: And by thy Spirits Influence Let me now Acted be. This Day, Oh! Spirit, from on High, Make thou a Mean and Sign, Of that Great Sabbacism, when I Shall in thy Glory shine! [VI.] Prayer Encouraged. Matth. 7.7â11. with Luk. II.9.13. That Lord, on whose Account alone Our Pray'rs prevail with God, Bids us Address that Glorious One, With Prayers for Ev'ry Good. Ask now, and ye shall have, (saith He) âSeek now, and ye shall find. âHeav'ns Doors, at which you Knocking be, âShall Open to your Mind. âWhat Father, to a Sons Request âFor Bread or Fish, will throw âA Stone or Snake? His very best âHe'l on a Son bestow. âGod is your Better Father; You âIn me, His Children are; You'l Gain, with His Good Spirit now, âAll Good Things else, by Pray'r. Joh. 16.23. âChildren, Then to the Father Go; âGo, in my Name, I say: âRich Blessings, He will give unto âThem, in that Name, who Pray. Instructions for CHILDREN. I. The Ancient Creed. IN GOD the FATHER I Believe; He's the Almighty One. I JESUS CHRIST, our Lord, Receive, God's Dear and Only SON. I do Adore the Holy SPIRIT; Who is to Raise the Dead, And bring His People to Inherit, Life that shall never Fade. II. The Child's Resolution. Help me my God! For unto thee I do Resolve to Pray, To Grant thy Christ and Grace to me; I'll do it every Day. Heavenly Father, Give me thy Christ; Give me thy Spirit; Pardon my Sins; Make me thy Servant; Bring me to thy Kingdom; O Great GOD, who art Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit; I Desire to be Thine for evermore. Amen. III. The Child at his Food. At Eating, thus I ever shou'd Devout and Thankful be; My God, I Bless thee for my Food; Let it be Bless'd to me. A Child, that when he goes to Eat, Thinks not of GOD at all, Is like the Bruits, which at their Meat On God do never call. IV. The Child thinking on his Baptism. Baptis'd for thee, O Glorious One, Thee for my GOD I take: Thee will I Love and Serve alone; And Thee my Portion make. My Baptism gave me unto thee; Possess me then, O Lord; My Father, Saviour, Leader be, According to thy Word. V. The Child on the Lord's Day. My Saviour's Risen from the Dead, And Lives Enthron'd Above; The Price of my Salvation's Paid, My Life is in His Love. With Holy Sabbaths He, in Peace, Hath me Victorious blest; Lord, Bring thou me, thro' Holiness, To Victory, and Rest. VI. The Child seeing the Funeral of another Child. I in the Burying Place may see Graves not so long as I. From Deaths Arrest no Age is free; Young Children too may Dy. My God, may such an awful sight Awakening be to me! Oh! that by Early Grace I might For Death prepared be. VII. The Body of Divinity Versifyed. [1.] A GOD there is, a GOD of boundless Might, In Wisdom, Justice, Goodness Infinite. [Heb. XI.6. Psal. CXLVII.5. CXLV.9,17.] 2. God is but ONE, &amp; yet in Persons Three The Father, Son, &amp; Spirit, One God we see. [1 Job. V. 7.] 3. Our God, by His Great Name JEHOVAH Known HE the World Made, and Keeps, and Rules Alone. [Neh. IX.6.] 4. To Glorify the Glorious GOD, is That For which He did all Men, &amp; me Create. [Isai. XLI. 21.] 5. God a Just Rule doth in our Bible give, A Rule, both what to Think, and how to Live. [2 Tim. III. 15,16,17] 6. Holy &amp; Happy our First Parents came From Gods Hand, with Gods Image in our Frame. [Gen. I. 27.] 7. Tasting Forbidden Fruit our Parents fell; This Taste has plung'd Mankind all down to Hell. [Rom. V. 12] 8. Our Blest Lord JESUS CHRIST, in our Distress, Comes to fetch us from Hell to Blessedness. [Luk. XIX.10.] 9. Into His Person, the Bright Son of God A Virgins Son took; There he makes Abode. [Isa. VII. 14.] 10. Life as a Priest CHRIST will His People bring, Light as a Prophet, and Law as a King. [Psal. CX.4. Acts III.22. Isa. XXXIII.22.] 11. For us our Surety Liv'd, for us He Dy'd, And Rising did to Heav'n in Triumph Ride. [Phil. II. 7, 8, 9.] 12. By Faith to CHRIST we for Salvation go; Faith too, as well as That must He bestow. [Eph. II.8.] 13. For Sin will the renew'd Believer Mourn, And from all Sin, hee'l by Repentance Turn. [Acts XX.21.] 14. Sinners receiving of Gods Pardon, they Gods Precept will, made Saints, with Love Obey. [Tit. II. 12,13,14.] 15. All Homage we must yield unto the Lord; In all Directed, by his Heavenly Word. His Works and Names, we may not use in Vain; Nor by our Works thereon His Days profane. With Honours due we must our Neighbours treat; And sweetly wish them Lives both Long and Sweet.

      <field name="fulltext">Part Four: Agricola Verse Singing at the PLOW. My Heart, how very Hard its grown! Thicken'd and stiffen'd Clay: Daily trod by the Wicked One; Of Sin the Beaten Way. An Heart, wherein compacted Weeds Of Diverse Lusts abound; No Entrance for the Heavenly Seeds, Falling on such a Ground! O my Almighty SAVIOUR, come; Thy Word's a wondrous Plow: And let thy SPIRIT drive it home; This Heart, Oh! Break it so! Lord, let my Broken Heart receive Thy Truth with Faith and Love: May it a Just Reception give To what falls from Above. Will my GOD Plow upon a Rock! Change thou the Soyl, my Lord! My Heart once by thy Plow-share broke, Will Entertain thy Word. The SOWER a Singer. Give me thy Heart, My SAVIOUR says: 'Tis what I strive to do. It's Barren: Change it, Lord, by Grace, A Fruitful Soyl into. [1.] When the Seed of thy Word is cast On such a Beaten Road; Let not the Fruit of all be lost, Nor under Foot be trod. May't be no Unattentive Heart, When There thy Lessons fall; Let not Hell's Harpyes do their part To rob me of them all. [2.] Oh, Do not leave my Heart to be An Unaffected Stone, Where Heavens Eye no Fruit will see, But what will soon be gone. Let there be found of PIETY In me a Root so deep, As from a vile Apostacy Will me for ever keep. [3.] Lord, Let not worldly Lusts and Cares Thy Work in me annoy; Cloak all good Fruit; and prove the snares That shall my Soul destroy. Ye Cursed Thorns I deprecate All your Entanglements. My SAVIOUR, Let not these defeat Thy Gospels kind Intents. [4.] O Glorious CHRIST of GOD, from whom Does all my Fruit proceed; Let thy sweet Influences come, And quicken Thou the Seed. With Fruits make me a Blessed Field; More precious Things than Gold; With Fruits of thy Good SPIRIT fill'd, More than an Hundred fold. The RAIN gasped for. O Father of the Rain, Look down Upon us from on high; If thy Land be not Rain'd upon, What Lives on it will Dy. Lord of the Clouds; In thee we hope; Thine all the Bottels are; Except Thou open them, a Drop won't fall upon us here. If thou make Heav'n as Brass, and burn From thence the groaning Field, Thy Earth will soon to Iron turn, And no Production yield. O Let thy Seasonable Rain Drop Fatness on our Soyl; And grant to most unworthy Man The Harvest of his Toil. But, O my SAVIOUR, in a Showre Of Righteousness descend: Gifts on me, with they SPIRIT poure; And Life that cannot End. Yea, come upon a World forlorn, And with a Quickening Dew, Make thou Mankind, of Water born, Tho' Dead, their Life Renew. In the mean time, thy Ministers, As Clouds, how Fat and Bright! May they upon Salvations Heirs Distil Things Good and Right. The Song of the SITHE. O My Long-suffering Lord, I own, And thy rich Patience praise; The Mower, he has not cut me down; I stand; O wondrous Grace! I wait, O of my Life the GOD! I'm waiting for the Stroke. I see the Mower: He's on the Road; Soon, soon, I'am overtook! O that I were in Safety got; That what I can't Evade I may with Comfort meet, and not Be of the Sithe afraid. I do with a Repenting Heart To thee, my GOD, Return; From all my Idols I depart, And for my Follies mourn. To Thee, my SAVIOUR, I Resign, All that belongs to me; Willing to be entirely Thine, And Heal'd and Rul'd by Thee. By Thee to be Redeem'd, and made Righteous and Holy too; And by thy Counsil to be led, Thy endless Glory to. Now, Welcome Sithe; Come, Do thy worst; Strike; Thou canst do no more, But fit me to be Lodg'd, I trust, In my GOD's Blessed Floor. The Sons of GOD, Singing among The Trees of GOD; Full of Sap, and of Songs before Him. A Barren Tree! O, Why, My Lord, This Cumberer of the Ground; Why has it not yet heard the Word, The Just Word, Cut it down! 'Tis owing, O my SAVIOUR, to thy Intercession still, That I am sav'd and standing so, And not thrown down to Hell. But from this Time, Oh, let me be A Tree of Righteousness: Fill'd with the Fruits of it; A Tree Which thou wilt own and Bless. A Tree planted and prun'd by GOD; Fix'd by His Water-side: The Fruits thereof Rich, Sweet, and Good; And Thou thence Glorified. From the Forbidden Tree I am, How Poison'd and Undone! From thence, how dismal Mischiefs came, And Deaths, in which I groan! But, O my SAVIOUR, By thy Death Upon a Tree, thou art The Tree of Life, to which my Faith Flies with a Joyful Heart. On Thee, O Tree of Life, I must Rejoicing Feed and Live; Thou'lt me, when fell'd and laid in Dust, A Resurrection give. Yea, When below to Mortal Eyes I must no more appear, Transplanted to thy Paradise, I shall still flourish there. The Songs of HARVEST. Tis not the Till'd, Poor, Lifeless Earth Which gives me all my Store. No: Tis my GOD! From Him comes forth All that has fill'd my Floor. For what I've gather'd from the Field Thee, Oh! my GOD I bless. But, Oh! that I Fruits too may yield To Him who me does dress! My Soul, with Gladness fill'd, and Food; Returns, what shall be made? In this Abundance serve thy GOD, In HIM for ever glad. Now in Obedience all my Days Hard at my Work I'll keep; Him I'l take pains to please and praise; Assur'd That I shall Reap. Yea, If I must thro' Sorrows go, And Weeping Eyes employ; I'm sure, That they in Tears who Sow At length shall Reap with Joy. But, Oh, What shall I Reap anon! What Eyes did ever see, Or to what Man on Earth is known, What will the Harvest be! My JESUS, My Rewarder Thou Wilt be; and more than so: Thou my Reward wilt be. And now No Higher can I go.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Part Five: Hymns [The Mercies of Almighty God] The Mercies of Almighty God To miserable Me, Purchas'd by His most precious Blood, Are, Oh! how Rich and Free! Mercies, which Answer and Remove All my just Miseries: Mercies, Well-worth my Praise and Love, And Thankful Sacrifice. Behold, O Gracious Lord, I do Present my self to Thee: No Beasts, but my Own Body to My God, shall Off'red be. A Body, by the Death of Thine For Thee full dearly Bought, To Thee, with Every Thing of mine, Is now Sincerely brought. My Living Body Off'red here So does continue Still; Oh! may it Live, Thy Name to Fear, And still to Do Thy Will. May, HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD On all I do in It, According to Thy Holy Word, Be now most Plainly Writ. May I, the Pleasing of Thee, make My daily care therein, And never any Pleasure take Defil'd with Loathsome Sin. Lord, Let me thus my Reason use In Off'ring Thee Thy Own: 'Tis all Right Reason I should choose To be Thine, Thine alone. Isaiah XXVI. The Title: When Moab shall be trodden down, And in mount Sion rest God's hand, In that day shall this Song, to God Be sung all over Judah's land. The Song [1] A City of exceeding strength Doth henceforth unto us belong, And the decreed salvation shall Like walls and bulwarks keep it strong. 2 Set open then the city gates, That so the righteous nation That keeps the truths, may enter in And of it take possession. 3 In perfect peace thou wilt him keep Whose thoughtful mind is one thee stay'd, And that because his confidence On thee alone is ever lay'd. 4 Put then your trust upon the Lord Throughout eternal ages length: Because the Lord Jehovah is A Rock of everlasting strength. 5 For he brought down high seated ones, The haughty city he laid low, He laid it level with the ground, And it into the dust did throw. 6 The feet of the afflicted man Triumphing trampled it upon, And it ly'th prostrate under foot, Foot of the poor and needy one. 7 Uprightness is the Kings high way, The very road the just did take: The path way of the righteous man Thou didst for him most even make. 8 Moreover in thy judgments way Thee, Lord, we longing look't to see: Our souls desire was to thy name, And to the memory of thee. 9 In evening and in morning prayer My soul thee earnestly desir'd; Yea with my spirit in midst of me I day and night for thee enquir'd. For when thy judgments are display'd On earth, the worlds inhabitants, Will lay to heart thy righteous works, And learn the righteousness of saints. 10 Though for a wicked man there should Bowels of divine pity yearn, Yet he the way of righteousness By no means will be brought to learn: In land of righteousness he will Still work perverse iniquity, He will not well consider of Jehovah's glorious majesty. 11 Lord, when thine hand was lifted up In exhaltation very high, Lest they should see thine hand, they did Perversely turn away their eye. But they with blushing shame, shall see The zeal thou for thy people hast, And the consuming fire that shall Thine adversaries wholly wast. 12 Jehovah, thou for ever wilt Safety and peace for us ordain: For our affairs thou manage didst And for us all our works maintain. 13 O Lord our God, thou only art Our Lord, yet others besides thee Have lorded it, and over us Have exercised tyranny: But notwithstanding henceforth we No other lord, save thee will take, And of no other name but thine From this time will we mention make. 14 Those that opprest us now are dead, So dead that they shall live no more, Their ghosts from hence departed are, And none shall them to life restore. Because thou hast them visited, And them hast utterly destroy'd. For ever they are perished And of all memory made void. 15 Jehovah thou the nation Hast very much increast, increast Hast thou the nation very much, Thy glory is made manifest; That nation which thou hadst remov'd, And far away didst send it forth By dissipating it unto The utmost ends of all the earth. 16 O Lord, when they were in distress They did thee visit with their cryes, And secret prayer they poured out, When as thou diddest them chastize. 17 Like as a pregnant woman when Approaching child-birth comes apace Is pain'd, and in her pangs cry's out, So were we Lord before thy face. 18 We have conceiv'd &amp; have been pain'd, We have as it were brought forth wind, The worlds inhabitants fell not On earth no safety we could find. 19 Thy dead shall surely live again, With my dead corps arise they must; Awake out of the sleep of death And sing ye who dwell in the dust: Because the dew that falls on thee Is like the dew that makes herbs grow And down from hence with violence The earth the Rephaims shall throw. 20 Come then, my people, enter in To chambers that most secret are, And after thee, shut thou the doors And fasten them with utmost care: There do thou hide thy self a while, It will but as a moment be, And all the indignation will Be wholly passed over thee. 21 Behold the Lord is coming forth Out of his habitation To punish their iniquity The earths inhabitants upon. The earth shall then disclose and show The bloods in her lay buried, Her slain shall be expos'd to view And be no longer covered. Divine hymns. [I.] The Song of the Pardoned. Luke VII. 4.7. THE Sin of my First Father is Mine, the Just Law doth say, The Sin of a Vile Nature, This Doth unto me Convey. Innumerable Sins I do Hence madly Perpetrate; Sins, which the Good I Have and Know; Doth sadly aggravate. But, O my Precious CHRIST, I see, THOU art my Surety made: A Full Obedience was by Thee To Thy Great Father Paid. Thy Vast Obedience is by Him Now freely Reckon'd mine; And me doth unto Life Redeem That Righteousness of Thine. O may I Love that Glorious One: Lord, Thou deserv'st my Love; Such Things Thy Love hath for me done, Things all my Thoughts above! My God, I Love Thee; And I Grieve That I Love Thee no more: I Love Thee, and that I may Live Thy Praises, I Implore. [II.] Good Inferences. Rom. VIII. 32,33,34,39. GOD, in His Love to man, don't spare His own Beloved Son; But gives Him up, the Curse to bear, For mans Redemption. Since He hath now for Sinners done That Greatest Thing, we know, On us, He won't count any One Too Great, for to bestow. Gods chosen who now can Arraign Whom God hath Justify'd? And who shall dare Those to Condemn, For whom His Christ hath Dy'd? Dy'd! Yea, and Rising from the Dead, At the Right-Hand of God, He Sits in Glorious Pow'r, to Plead The Merits of His Blood. Us from such Love of God as This, A Love so Free and Great, In our Lord Jesus Christ, there is Nothing shall Separate. [III.] The Lessons of the Gospel. From Tit. 2,11,12,13,14. The Gospel of Gods Glorious Grace, Which with News of Salvation Shines every where, Ungodliness And Worldly Lusts, bids us to shun. It bids and binds us, all to take, A Sober, Righteous, Godly Way, And Conscience of all Duty make, While in this present World we stay: Hoping and Looking daily for The Blessed Promise of this Word, That the Great God our Savior, Shall come in Glory: Come O Lord! Even JESUS CHRIST, who freely gave Himself to Death, for us, that we Might through Him Redemption have From that Worse Thing Iniquitie: And He Himself, so Purifie A People, His own Choice, and Rare, Who Zealous of Good Works shall be, And in that Zeal peculiar. [IV.] Evening Thoughts. Phil. I. 21. Thy CHRIST is now my Life: I fly To CHRIST with an Enliven'd Faith. And now 'twill be my Gain to Dy, To CHRIST fetch'd by a Stingless Death. An hymn. The Right Understanding of much Affliction Heb. XII. 5,6,11. The Exhortation of the Lord, With Consolation Speaks to us; As unto Children, His Good Word, We must Remember, Speaking Thus: âMy Child, when God shall Chasten Thee, âHis Chastning do thou not Contemn: âWhen Thou His Just Rebukes dost see, âFaint not, Rebuked under Them. The Lord with fit Afflictions will, Correct the Children of His Love; He doth Himself their Father still; By His most Wise Corrections prove. Afflictions for the present here The Vexed Flesh will Grievous call; But Afterwards there will appear, Not Grief, but Peace, the End of all. Tried, and Coming forth as Gold. A Short HYMN, To Assist the Pauses of a SELF-EXAMINATION. The Trial of a Soul, Believing. My Soul, Dost thou a Precious Christ Prize above all, &amp; Place on High? And on His Gospel-way to Rest, Rest, and with Purest Hopes rely! Repenting. My Soul, The Death of Every Sin Dost thou as thy own Life pursue! And welcome any Bitter Thing That will more Bitter Sin Subdue? Loving. My Soul, To Know and Serve thy God, To all things here dost thou prefer? And as a Brother Seek the Good Of all that His dear Children are? Coming into the Covenant of GOD LORD, Sav'd by Grace, how Rich &amp; Free! My Quick'ned Soul comes at thy call. I to Thy COVENANT agree; JESUS, My Head, Fulfill it all!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Part Six: Bible Verse X. COMMANDMENTS. Worship thou shalt no God but me. No graven Image make to thee. The Lords Name take not thou in vain. The Sabbath do not thou profane. Yield to thy Parents Honour due. And see that thou no Murder do. Commit thou no Adultery. Moreover from all Stealing fly. No false thing of thy Neighbor say. And Covet not in any way. THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. LORD, I should have no Lord, beside Thee, to be Lov'd, Serv'd, Glorify'd. I should the Glory due to Thee, In Wayes, pay that Appointed be. Thy Name, Thy Words, Thy Works, I should, Sacred for proper Uses hold. The Dayes which thou made Sacred hast, I should not in Diversions wast. In their Fit places every one, I should with all Fit Honours own. That Life none may unjustly Lose, Means I should with all kindness use. Chast I should be in every part, Yea, chast in every Thought of Heart. To Get and Keep my Worldly Wealth, I should commit no sort of Stealth. Truth I should utter and maintain, And no Good Name with Slander Stain. With Sweet content I should Receive All the Wise God will please to give. Lord, by the Blood of CHRIST, I pray, Save me, who do not thus obey; And by the Strength of CHRIST, from hence, Sav't, Let me yield Obedience. A Preparatory Thanksgiving-Song, fetch'd from the Beginning and Conclusion of the Hundred and Third Psalm. A Wake, my Soul, Awake, and Bless JEHOVAH the most Blessed One: Bless Him, and His Blest Holiness Let all my Inward Powers Own. The Glories of that Lord, my Soul, Confess with Praises, just and high; And His vast Benefits Extol With a most Thankful Memory. Tho' thy Sins have His Wrath incurr'd He does those Horrid Sins Forgive; And tho' thy Sins have thee procur'd Diseases, These He does Relieve. He does from Deaths and Hells dark place Thy Life, though Forfeited, Redeem: And with Rich Mercies of His Grace, Thou art, How Richly! Crown'd by Him. Thy Mouth did never Wisely Crave That Good, which He would not afford. Such Bowels is our Fathers have, And more than such are in the Lord. O ye Bright Angels, who transcend In Might, show with your Might abroad, While ye His Will and Voice attend, The Praise of our Almighty God. Armies of Angels, that Obey The Great Gods only Son and Heir, His Greatness, Oh! Gladly Display: You and We, His Glad Servants are. All He has made, throughout His whole Dominion too, Let all Adore Their Maker: But, O Thou, my Soul, Bear part with them for-ever-more.</field>
