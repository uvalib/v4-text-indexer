      <field name="fulltext">Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral DEDICATION. To the Right Honourable the COUNTESS OF HUNTINGDON, THE FOLLOWING POEMS Are most respectfully Inscribed, By her much obliged, Very humble, And devoted Servant, Phillis Wheatley. Boston, June 12, 1773. TO MÃCENAS. MÃCENAS, you, beneath the myrtle shade, Read o'er what poets sung, and shepherds play'd. What felt those poets but you feel the same? Does not your soul possess the sacred flame? Their noble strains your equal genius shares In softer language, and diviner airs. While Homer paints lo! circumfus'd in air, Celestial Gods in mortal forms appear; Swift as they move hear each recess rebound, Heav'n quakes, earth trembles, and the shores resound. Great Sire of verse, before my mortal eyes, The lightnings blaze across the vaulted skies, And, as the thunder shakes the heav'nly plains, A deep-felt horror thrills through all my veins. When gentler strains demand thy graceful song, The length'ning line moves languishing along. When great Patroclus courts Achilles' aid, The grateful tribute of my tears is paid; Prone on the shore he feels the pangs of love, And stern Pelides tend'rest passions move. Great Maro's strain in heav'nly numbers flows, The Nine inspire, and all the bosom glows. O could I rival thine and Virgil's page, Or claim the Muses with the Mantuan Sage; Soon the same beauties should my mind adorn, And the same ardors in my soul should burn: Then should my song in bolder notes arise, And all my numbers pleasingly surprize; But here I sit, and mourn a grov'ling mind, That fain would mount, and ride upon the wind. Not you, my friend, these plaintive strains become, Not you, whose bosom is the Muses home; When they from tow'ring Helicon retire, They fan in you the bright immortal fire, But I less happy, cannot raise the song, The fault'ring music dies upon my tongue. The happier Terence He was an African by birth. all the choir inspir'd, His soul replenish'd, and his bosom fir'd; But say, ye Muses, why this partial grace, To one alone of Afric's sable race; From age to age transmitting thus his name With the first glory in the rolls of fame? Thy virtues, great MÃ¦cenas! shall be sung In praise of him, from whom those virtues sprung: While blooming wreaths around thy temples spread, I'll snatch a laurel from thine honour'd head, While you indulgent smile upon the deed. As long as Thames in streams majestic flows, Or Naiads in their oozy beds repose, While PhÅbus reigns above the starry train, While bright Aurora purples o'er the main, So long, great Sir, the muse thy praise shall sing, So long thy praise shall make Parnassus ring: Then grant, MÃ¦cenas, thy paternal rays, Hear me propitious, and defend my lays. ON VIRTUE. O Thou bright jewel in my aim I strive To comprehend thee. Thine own words declare Wisdom is higher than a fool can reach. I cease to wonder, and no more attempt Thine height t'explore, or fathom thy profound. But, O my soul, sink not into despair, Virtue is near thee, and with gentle hand Would now embrace thee, hovers o'er thine head. Fain would the heav'n-born soul with her converse, Then seek, then court her for her promis'd bliss. Auspicious queen, thine heav'nly pinions spread, And lead celestial Chastity along; Lo! now her sacred retinue descends, Array'd in glory from the orbs above. Attend me, Virtue, thro' my youthful years! O leave me not to the false joys of time! But guide my steps to endless life and bliss. Greatness, or Goodness, say what I shall call thee, To give an higher appellation still, Teach me a better strain, a nobler lay, O Thou, enthron'd with Cherubs in the realms of day! TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE, IN NEW-ENGLAND. WHILE an intrinsic ardor prompts to write, The muses promise to assist my pen; 'Twas not long since I left my native shore The land of errors, and Egyptian gloom: Father of mercy, 'twas thy gracious hand Brought me in safety from those dark abodes. Students, to you 'tis giv'n to scan the heights Above, to traverse the ethereal space, And mark the systems of revolving worlds. Still more, ye sons of science ye receive The blissful news by messengers from heav'n, How Jesus' blood for your redemption flows. See him with hands out-stretcht upon the cross; Immense compassion in his bosom glows; He hears revilers, nor resents their scorn: What matchless mercy in the Son of God! When the whole human race by sin had fall'n, He deign'd to die that they might rise again, And share with him in the sublimest skies, Life without death, and glory without end. Improve your privileges while they stay, Ye pupils, and each hour redeem, that bears Or good or bad report of you to heav'n. Let sin, that baneful evil to the soul, By you be shunn'd, nor once remit your guard; Suppress the deadly serpent in its egg. Ye blooming plants of human race devine, An Ethiop tells you 'tis your greatest foe; Its transient sweetness turns to endless pain, And in immense perdition sinks the soul. TO THE KING'S MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY. 1768. YOUR subjects hope, dread Sireâ The crown upon your brows may flourish long, And that your arm may in your God be strong! O may your sceptre num'rous nations sway, And all with love and readiness obey! But how shall we the British king reward! Rule thou in peace, our father, and our lord! Midst the remembrance of thy favours past, The meanest peasants most admire the last. The Repeal of the Stamp Act. May George, belov'd by all the nations round, Live with heav'ns choicest constant blessings crown'd! Great God, direct, and guard him from on high, And from his head let ev'ry evil fly! And may each clime with equal gladness see A monarch's smile can set his subjects free! ON BEING BROUGHT FROM AFRICA TO AMERICA. 'TWAS mercy brought me from my Pagan land, Taught my benighted soul to understand That there's a God, that there's a Saviour too: Once I redemption neither sought nor knew. Some view our sable race with scornful eye, âTheir colour is a diabolic die.â Remember, Christians, Negros, black as Cain, May be refin'd, and join th' angelic train. ON THE DEATH OF THE REV. DR. SEWELL. 1769. ERE yet the morn its lovely blushes spread, See Sewell number'd with the happy dead. Hail, holy man, arriv'd th' immortal shore, Though we shall hear thy warning voice no more. Come, let us all behold with wishful eyes The saint ascending to his native skies; From hence the prophet wing'd his rapt'rous way To the blest mansions in eternal day. Then begging for the Spirit of our God, And panting eager for the same abode, Come, let us all with the same vigour rise, And take a prospect of the blissful skies; While on our minds Christ's image is imprest, And the dear Saviour glows in ev'ry breast. Thrice happy saint! to find thy heav'n at last, What compensation for the evils past! Great God, incomprehensible, unknown By sense, we bow at thine exalted throne. O, while we beg thine excellence to feel, Thy sacred Spirit to our hearts reveal, And give us of that mercy to partake, Which thou hast promis'd for the Saviour's sake! âSewell is dead.â Swift-pinion'd Fame thus cry'd. âIs Sewell dead,â my trembling tongue reply'd, O what a blessing in his flight deny'd! How oft for us the holy prophet pray'd! How oft to us the Word of Life convey'd! By duty urg'd my mournful verse to close, I for his tomb this epitaph compose. âLo, here a Man, redeem'd by Jesus' blood, âA sinner once, but now a saint with God; âBehold ye rich, ye poor, ye fools, ye wise, âNor let his monument your heart surprize; â'Twill tell you what this holy man has done, âWhich gives him brighter lustre than the sun. âListen, ye happy, from your seats above. âI speak sincerely, while I speak and love, âHe sought the paths of piety and truth, âBy these made happy from his early youth; âIn blooming years that grace divine he felt, âWhich rescues sinners from the chains of guilt. âMourn him, ye indigent, whom he has fed, âAnd henceforth seek, like him, for living bread; âEv'n Christ, the bread descending from above, âAnd ask an int'rest in his saving love. âMourn him, ye youth, to whom he oft has told âGod's gracious wonders from the times of old. âI, too have cause this mighty loss to mourn, âFor he my monitor will not return. âO when shall we to his blest state arrive? âWhen the same graces in our bosoms thrive.â ON THE DEATH OF THE REV. MR. GEORGE WHITEFIELD. 1770. HAIL, happy saint, on thine immortal throne, Possest of glory, life, and bliss unknown; We hear no more the music of thy tongue, Thy wonted auditories cease to throng. Thy sermons in unequall'd accents flow'd, And ev'ry bosom with devotion glow'd; Thou didst in strains of eloquence refin'd Inflame the heart, and captivate the mind. Unhappy we the setting sun deplore, So glorious once, but ah! it shines no more. Behold the prophet in his tow'ring flight! He leaves the earth for heav'n's unmeasur'd height, And worlds unknown receive him from our sight. There Whitefield wings with rapid course his way, And sails to Zion through vast seas of day. Thy pray'rs, great saint, and thine incessant cries Have pierc'd the bosom of thy native skies. Thou moon hast seen, and all the stars of light, How he has wrestled with his God by night. He pray'd that grace in ev'ry heart might dwell, He long'd to see America excel; He charg'd its youth that ev'ry grace divine Should with full lustre in their conduct shine; That Saviour, which his soul did first receive, The greatest gift that ev'n a God can give, He freely offer'd to the num'rous throng, That on his lips with list'ning pleasure hung. âTake him, ye wretched, for your only good, âTake him ye starving sinners, for your food; âYe thirsty, come to this life-giving stream, âYe preachers, take him for your joyful theme; âTake him my dear Americans, he said, âBe your complaints on his kind bosom laid: âTake him, ye Africans, he longs for you, âImpartial Saviour is his title due: âWash'd in the fountain of redeeming blood, âYou shall be sons, and kings, and priests to God.â Great Countess, The Countess of Huntingdon, to whom Mr. Whitefield was Chaplain. we Americans revere Thy name, and mingle in thy grief sincere; New England deeply feels, the Orphans mourn, Their more than father will no more return. But, though arrested by the hand of death, Whitefield no more exerts his lab'ring breath, Yet let us view him in th' eternal skies, Let ev'ry heart to this bright vision rise; While the tomb safe retains its sacred trust, Till life divine re-animates his dust. ON THE DEATH OF A YOUNG LADY OF FIVE YEARS OF AGE. FROM dark abodes to fair etherial light Th' enraptur'd innocent has wing'd her flight; On the kind bosom of eternal love She finds unknown beatitude above. This know, ye parents, nor her loss deplore, She feels the iron hand of pain no more; The dispensations of unerring grace, Should turn your sorrows into grateful praise; Let then no tears for her henceforward flow, No more distress'd in our dark vale below. Her morning sun, which rose divinely bright, Was quickly mantled with the gloom of night; But hear in heav'n's blest bow'rs your Nancy fair, And learn to imitate her language there. âThou, Lord, whom I behold with glory crown'd, âBy what sweet name, and in what tuneful sound âWilt thou be prais'd? Seraphic pow'rs are faint âInfinite love and majesty to paint. âTo thee let all their grateful voices raise, âAnd saints and angels join their songs of âpraise.â Perfect in bliss she from her heav'nly home Looks down, and smiling beckons you to come; Why then, fond parents, why these fruitless groans? Restrain your tears, and cease your plaintive moans. Freed from a world of sin, and snares, and pain, Why would you wish your daughter back again? Noâbow resign'd. Let hope your grief control, And check the rising tumult of the soul. Calm in the prosperous, and adverse day, Adore the God who gives and takes away; Eye him in all, his holy name revere, Upright your actions, and your hearts sincere, Till having sail'd through life's tempestuous sea, And from its rocks, and boist'rous billows free, Yourselves, safe landed on the blissful shore, Shall join your happy babe to part no more. ON THE DEATH OF A YOUNG GENTLEMAN. WHO taught thee conflict with the pow'rs of night, To vanquish Satan in the fields of fight? Who strung thy feeble arms with might unknown, How great thy conquest, and how bright thy crown! War with each princedom, throne, and pow'r is o'er, The scene is ended to return no more. O could my muse thy seat on high behold, How deckt with laurel, how enrich'd with gold! O could she hear what praise thine harp employs, How sweet thine anthems, how divine thy joys! What heav'nly grandeur should exalt her strain! What holy raptures in her numbers reign! To sooth the troubles of the mind to peace, To still the tumult of life's tossing seas, To ease the anguish of the parents heart, What shall my sympathizing verse impart? Where is the balm to heal so deep a wound? Where shall a sov'reign remedy be found? Look, gracious Spirit, from thine heav'nly bow'r, And thy full joys into their bosoms pour; The raging tempest of their grief control, And spread the dawn of glory through the soul, To eye the path the saint departed trod, And trace him to the bosom of his God. TO A LADY ON THE DEATH OF HER HUSBAND. GRIM monarch! see, depriv'd of vital breath, A young physician in the dust of death: Dost thou go on incessant to destroy, Our griefs to double, and lay waste our joy? Enough thou never yet wast known to say, Though millions die, the vassals of thy sway: Nor youth, nor science, nor the ties of love, Nor aught on earth thy flinty heart can move. The friend, the spouse from his dire dart to save, In vain we ask the sovereign of the grave. Fair mourner, there see thy lov'd Leonard laid, And o'er him spread the deep impervious shade; Clos'd are his eyes, and heavy fetters keep His senses bound in never-waking sleep, Till time shall cease, till many a starry world Shall fall from heav'n, in dire confusion hurl'd, Till nature in her final wreck shall lie, And her last groan shall rend the azure sky: Not, not till then his active soul shall claim His body, a divine immortal frame. But see the softly-stealing tears apace Pursue each other down the mourner's face; But cease thy tears, bid ev'ry sigh depart, And cast the load of anguish from thine heart: From the cold shell of his great soul arise, And look beyond, thou native of the skies; There fix thy view, where fleeter than the wind Thy Leonard mounts, and leaves the earth behind. Thyself prepare to pass the vale of night To join for ever on the hills of light: To thine embrace his joyful spirit moves To thee, the partner of his earthly loves; He welcomes thee to pleasures more refin'd, And better suited to th' immortal mind. GOLIATH OF GATH. 1 Sam. Chap. XVII. YE martial pow'rs, and all ye tuneful nine, Inspire my song, and aid my high design. The dreadful scenes and toils of war I write, The ardent warriors, and the fields of fight: You best remember, and you best can sing The acts of heroes to the vocal string: Resume the lays with which your sacred lyre, Did then the poet and the sage inspire. Now front to front the armies were display'd, Here Israel rang'd, and there the foes array'd; The hosts on two opposing mountains stood, Thick as the foliage of the waving wood; Between them an extensive valley lay, O'er which the gleaming armour pour'd the day, When from the camp of the Philistine foes, Dreadful to view, a mighty warrior rose; In the dire deeds of bleeding battle skill'd, The monster stalks the terror of the field. From Gath he sprung, Goliath was his name, Of fierce deportment, and gigantic frame: A brazen helmet on his head was plac'd, A coat of mail his form terrific grac'd, The greaves his legs, the targe his shoulders prest: Dreadful in arms high-tow'ring o'er the rest A spear he proudly wav'd, whose iron head, Strange to relate, six hundred shekels weigh'd; He strode along, and shook the ample field, While PhÅbus blaz'd refulgent on his shield: Through Jacob's race a chilling horror ran, When thus the huge, enormous chief began: âSay, what the cause that in this proud array âYou set your battle in the face of day? âOne hero find in all your vaunting train, âThen see who loses, and who wins the plain; âFor he who wins, in triumph may demand âPerpetual service from the vanquish'd land: âYour armies I defy, your force despise, âBy far inferior in Philistia's eyes: âProduce a man, and let us try the fight, âDecide the contest, and the victor's right.â Thus challeng'd he: all Israel stood amaz'd, And ev'ry chief in consternation gaz'd; But Jesse's son in youthful bloom appears, And warlike courage far beyond his years: He left the folds, he left the flow'ry meads, And soft recesses of the sylvan shades. Now Israel's monarch, and his troops arise, With peals of shouts ascending to the skies; In Elah's vale the scene of combat lies. When the fair morning blush'd with orient red, What David's sire enjoin'd the son obey'd, And swift of foot towards the trench he came, Where glow'd each bosom with the martial flame. He leaves his carriage to another's care, And runs to greet his brethren of the war. While yet they spake the giant-chief arose, Repeats the challenge, and insults his foes: Struck with the sound, and trembling at the view, Affrighted Israel from its post withdrew. âObserve ye this tremendous foe, they cry'd, âWho in proud vaunts our armies hath defy'd: âWhoever lays him prostrate on the plain, âFreedom in Israel for his house shall gain; âAnd on him wealth unknown the king will pour, âAnd give his royal daughter for his dow'r.â Then Jesse's youngest hope: âMy brethren say, âWhat shall be done for him who takes away âReproach from Jacob, who destroys the chief, âAnd puts a period to his country's grief. âHe vaunts the honours of his arms abroad, âAnd scorns the armies of the living God.â Thus spoke the youth, th' attentive people ey'd The wond'rous hero, and again reply'd: âSuch the rewards our monarch will bestow, âOn him who conquers, and destroys his foe.â Eliab heard, and kindled into ire To hear his shepherd-brother thus inquire, And thus begun? âWhat errand brought thee? say âWho keeps thy flock? or does it go astray? âI know the base ambition of thine heart, âBut back in safety from the field depart.â Eliab thus to Jesse's youngest heir, Express'd his wrath in accents most severe. When to his brother mildly he reply'd, âWhat have I done? or what the cause to chide?â The words were told before the king, who sent For the young hero to his royal tent: Before the monarch dauntless he began, âFor this Philistine fail no heart of man: âI'll take the vale, and with the giant fight: âI dread not all his boasts, nor all his might.â When thus the king: âDar'st thou a stripling go, âAnd venture combat with so great a foe? âWho all his days has been inur'd to fight, âAnd made its deeds his study and delight: âBattles and bloodshed brought the monster forth, âAnd clouds and whirlwinds usher'd in his birth.â When David thus: âI kept the fleecy care, âAnd out there rush'd a lion and a bear; âA tender lamb the hungry lion took, âAnd with no other weapon than my crook âBold I pursu'd, and chas'd him o'er the field, âThe prey deliver'd, and the felon kill'd: âAs thus the lion and the bear I slew, âSo shall Goliath fall, and all his crew: âThe God, who sav'd me from these beasts of prey, âBy me this monster in the dust shall lay.â So David spoke. The wond'ring king reply'd; âGo thou with heav'n and victory on thy side: âThis coat of mail, this sword gird on,â he said, And plac'd a mighty helmet on his head: The coat, the sword, the helm he laid aside, Nor chose to venture with those arms untry'd, Then took his staff, and to the neighb'ring brook Instant he ran, and thence five pebbles took. Mean time descended to Philistia's son A radiant cherub, and he thus begun: âGoliath, well thou know'st thou hast defy'd âYon Hebrew armies, and their God deny'd: âRebellious wretch! audacious worm! forbear, âNor tempt the vengeance of their God too far: âThem, who with his omnipotence contend, âNo eye shall pity, and no arm defend: âProud as thou art, in short liv'd glory great, âI come to tell thee thine approaching fate. âRegard my words. The judge of all the gods, âBeneath whose steps the tow'ring mountain nods, âWill give thine armies to the savage brood, âThat cut the liquid air, or range the wood. âThee too a well-aim'd pebble shall destroy, âAnd thou shalt perish by a beardless boy: âSuch is the mandate from the realms above, âAnd should I try the vengeance to remove, âMyself a rebel to my king would prove. âGoliath say, shall grace to him be shown, âWho dares heav'ns monarch, and insults his throne?â âYour words are lost on me,â the giant cries, While fear and wrath contended in his eyes, When thus the messenger from heav'n replies: âProvoke no more Jehovah's awful hand âTo hurl its vengeance on thy guilty land: âHe grasps the thunder, and, he wings the storm, âServants their sov'reign's orders to perform.â The angel spoke, and turn'd his eyes away, Adding new radiance to the rising day. Now David comes: the fatal stones demand His left, the staff engag'd his better hand: The giant mov'd, and from his tow'ring height Survey'd the stripling, and disdain'd the sight, And thus began: âAm I a dog with thee? âBring'st thou no armour, but a staff to me? âThe gods on thee their vollied curses pour, âAnd beasts and birds of prey thy flesh devour.â David undaunted thus, âThy spear and shield âShall no protection to thy body yield: âJehovah's nameâno other arms I bear, âI ask no other in this glorious war. âTo-day the Lord of Hosts to me will give âVict'ry, to-day thy doom thou shalt receive; âThe fate you threaten shall your own become, âAnd beasts shall be your animated tomb, âThat all the earth's inhabitants may know âThat there's a God, who governs all below: âThis great assembly too shall witness stand, âThat needs nor sword, nor spear, th' Almighty's hand: âThe battle his, the conquest he bestows, âAnd to our pow'r consigns our hated foes.â Thus David spoke; Goliath heard and came To meet the hero in the field of fame. Ah! fatal meeting to thy troops and thee, But thou wast deaf to the divine decree; Young David meets thee, meets thee not in vain; 'Tis thine to perish on th' ensanguin'd plain. And now the youth the forceful pebble flung, Philistia trembled as it whizz'd along: In his dread forehead, where the helmet ends, Just o'er the brows the well-aim'd stone descends, It pierc'd the skull, and shatter'd all the brain, Prone on his face he tumbled to the plain: Goliath's fall no smaller terror yields Than riving thunders in aerial fields: The soul still ling'red in its lov'd abode, Till conq'ring David o'er the giant strode: Goliath's sword then laid its master dead, And from the body hew'd the ghastly head; The blood in gushing torrents drench'd the plains, The soul found passage through the spouting veins. And now aloud th' illustrious victor said, âWhere are your boastings now your champion's dead?â Scarce had he spoke, when the Philistines fled: But fled in vain; the conqu'ror swift persu'd: What scenes of slaughter! and what seas of blood! There Saul thy thousands grasp'd th' impurpled sand In pangs of death the conquest of thine hand; And David there were thy ten thousands laid: Thus Israel's damsels musically play'd. Near Gath and Ekron many an hero lay, Breath'd out their souls, and curs'd the light of day: Their fury, quench'd by death, no longer burns, And David with Goliath's head returns, To Salem brought, but in his tent he plac'd The load of armour which the giant grac'd. His monarch saw him coming from the war, And thus demanded of the son of Ner. âSay, who is this amazing youth?â he cry'd, When thus the leader of the host reply'd; âAs lives thy soul I know not whence he sprung, âSo great in prowess though in years so young:â âInquire whose son is he,â the sov'reign said, âBefore whose conq'ring arm Philistia fled.â Before the king behold the stripling stand, Goliath's head depending from his hand: To him the king: âSay of what martial line âArt thou, young hero, and what sire was thine?â He humbly thus; âthe son of Jesse I: âI came the glories of the field to try. âSmall is my tribe, but valiant in the fight; âSmall is my city, but thy royal right.â âThen take the promis'd gifts,â the monarch cry'd, Conferring riches and the royal bride: âKnit to my soul for ever thou remain âWith me, nor quit my regal roof again.â THOUGHTS ON THE WORKS OF PROVIDENCE. ARISE, my soul, on wings enraptur'd, rise To praise the monarch of the earth and skies, Whose goodness and beneficence appear As round its centre moves the rolling year, Or when the morning glows with rosy charms, Or the sun slumbers in the ocean's arms: Of light divine be a rich portion lent To guide my soul, and favour my intent. Celestial muse, my arduous flight sustain, And raise my mind to a seraphic strain! Ador'd for ever be the God unseen, Which round the sun revolves this vast machine, Though to his eye its mass a point appears: Ador'd the God that whirls surrounding spheres, Which first ordain'd that mighty Sol should reign The peerless monarch of th' ethereal train: Of miles twice forty millions is his height, And yet his radiance dazzles mortal sight So far beneathâfrom him th' extended earth Vigour derives, and ev'ry flow'ry birth: Vast through her orb she moves with easy grace Around her PhÅbus in unbounded space; True to her course th' impetuous storm derides, Triumphant o'er the winds, and surging tides. Almighty, in these wond'rous works of thine, What Pow'r, what Wisdom, and what Goodness shine? And are thy wonders, Lord, by men explor'd, And yet creating glory unador'd! Creation smiles in various beauty gay, While day to night, and night succeeds to day: That Wisdom, which attends Jehovah's ways, Shines most conspicuous in the solar rays: Without them, destitute of heat and light, This world would be the reign of endless night: In their excess how would our race complain, Abhorring life! how hate its length'ned chain! From air adust what num'rous ills would rise? What dire contagion taint the burning skies? What pestilential vapours, fraught with death, Would rise, and overspread the lands beneath? Hail, smiling morn, that from the orient main Ascending dost adorn the heav'nly plain! So rich, so various are thy beauteous dies, That spread through all the circuit of the skies, That, full of thee, my soul in rapture soars, And thy great God, the cause of all adores. O'er beings infinite his love extends, His Wisdom rules them, and his Pow'r defends. When tasks diurnal tire the human frame, The spirits faint, and dim the vital flame, Then too that ever active bounty shines, Which not infinity of space confines. The sable veil, that Night in silence draws, Conceals effects, but shews th' Almighty Cause; Night seals in sleep the wide creation fair, And all is peaceful but the brow of care. Again, gay PhÅbus, as the day before, Wakes ev'ry eye, but what shall wake no more; Again the face of nature is renew'd, Which still appears harmonious, fair, and good. May grateful strains salute the smiling morn, Before its beams the eastern hills adorn! Shall day to day, and night to night conspire To show the goodness of the Almighty Sire? This mental voice shall man regardless hear, And never, never raise the filial pray'r? To-day, O hearken, nor your folly mourn For time mispent, that never will return. But see the sons of vegetation rise, And spread their leafy banners to the skies. All-wise Almighty providence we trace In trees, and plants, and all the flow'ry race; As clear as in the nobler frame of man, All lovely copies of the Maker's plan. The pow'r the same that forms a ray of light, That call'd creation from eternal night. âLet there be light,â he said: from his profound Old Chaos heard, and trembled at the sound: Swift as the word, inspir'd by pow'r divine, Behold the light around its maker shine, The first fair product of th' omnific God, And now through all his works diffus'd abroad. As reason's pow'rs by day our God disclose, So we may trace him in the night's repose: Say what is sleep? and dreams how passing strange! When action ceases, and ideas range Licentious and unbounded o'er the plains, Where Fancy's queen in giddy triumph reigns. Hear in soft strains the dreaming lover sigh To a kind fair, or rave in jealousy; On pleasure now, and now on vengeance bent, The lab'ring passions struggle for a vent. What pow'r, O man! thy reason then restores, So long suspended in nocturnal hours? What secret hand returns the mental train, And gives improv'd thine active pow'rs again? From thee, O man, what gratitude should rise! And, when from balmy sleep thou op'st thine eyes, Let thy first thoughts be praises to the skies. How merciful our God who thus imparts O'erflowing tides of joy to human hearts, When wants and woes might be our righteous lot, Our God forgetting, by our God forgot! Among the mental pow'rs a question rose, âWhat most the image of th' Eternal shows?â When thus to Reason (so let Fancy rove) Her great companion spoke immortal Love. âSay, mighty pow'r, how long shall strife prevail, âAnd with its murmurs load the whisp'ring gale? âRefer the cause to Recollection's shrine, âWho loud proclaims my origin divine, âThe cause whence heav'n and earth began to be, âAnd is not man immortaliz'd by me? âReason let this most causeless strife subside.â Thus Love pronounc'd, and Reason thus reply'd. âThy birth, celestial queen! 'tis mine to own, âIn thee resplendent is the Godhead shown; âThy words persuade, my soul enraptur'd feels âResistless beauty which thy smile reveals.â Ardent she spoke, and, kindling at her charms, She clasp'd the blooming goddess in her arms. Infinite Love wher'er we turn our eyes Appears: this ev'ry creature's wants supplies; This most is heard in Nature's constant voice, This makes the morn, and this the eve rejoice; This bids the fost'ring rains and dews descend To nourish all, to serve one gen'ral end, The good of man: yet man ungrateful pays But little homage, and but little praise. To him, whose works array'd with mercy shine, What songs should rise, how constant, how divine! TO A LADY ON THE DEATH OF THREE RELATIONS. WE trace the pow'r of Death from tomb to tomb, And his are all the ages yet to come. 'Tis his to call the planets from on high, To blacken PhÅbus, and dissolve the sky; His too, when all in his dark realms are hurl'd, From its firm base to shake the solid world; His fatal sceptre rules the spacious whole, And trembling nature rocks from pole to pole. Awful he moves, and wide his wings are spread: Behold thy brother number'd with the dead! From bondage freed, the exulting spirit flies Beyond Olympus, and these starry skies. Lost in our woe for thee, blest shade, we mourn In vain; to earth thou never must return. Thy sisters too, fair mourner, feel the dart Of Death, and with fresh torture rend thine heart. Weep not for them, who wish thine happy mind To rise with them, and leave the world behind. As a young plant by hurricanes up torn, So near its parent lies the newly bornâ But 'midst the bright ethereal train behold It shines superior on a throne of gold: Then, mourner, cease; let hope thy tears restrain, Smile on the tomb, and sooth the raging pain. On yon blest regions fix thy longing view, Mindless of sublunary scenes below; Ascend the sacred mount, in thought arise, And seek substantial and immortal joys; Where hope receives, where faith to vision springs, And raptur'd seraphs tune th' immortal strings To strains extatic. Thou the chorus join, And to thy father tune the praise divine. TO A CLERGYMAN ON THE DEATH OF HIS LADY. WHERE contemplation finds her sacred spring, Where heav'nly music makes the arches ring, Where virtue reigns unsully'd and divine, Where wisdom thron'd, and all the graces shine, There sits thy spouse amidst the radiant throng, While praise eternal warbles from her tongue; There choirs angelic shout her welcome round, With perfect bliss, and peerless glory crown'd. While thy dear mate, to flesh no more confin'd, Exults a blest, an heav'n-ascended mind, Say in thy breast shall floods of sorrow rise? Say shall its torrents overwhelm thine eyes? Amid the seats of heav'n a place is free, And angels ope their bright ranks for thee; For thee they wait, and with expectant eye Thy spouse leans downward from th' empyreal sky: âO come away, her longing spirit cries, âAnd share with me the raptures of the skies. âOur bliss divine to mortals is unknown; âImmortal life and glory are our own. âThere too may the dear pledges of our love âArrive, and taste with us the joys above; âAttune the harp to more than mortal lays, âAnd join with us the tribute of their praise âTo him, who dy'd stern justice to atone, âAnd make eternal glory all our own. âHe in his death slew ours, and, as he rose, âHe crush'd the dire dominion of our foes; âVain were their hopes to put the God to flight, âChain us to hell, and bar the gates of light.â She spoke, and turn'd from mortal scenes her eyes, Which beam'd celestial radiance o'er the skies. Then thou, dear man, no more with grief retire, Let grief no longer damp devotion's fire, But rise sublime, to equal bliss aspire. Thy sighs no more be wafted by the wind, No more complain, but be to heav'n resign'd. 'Twas thine t' unfold the oracles divine, To sooth our woes the task was also thine; Now sorrow is incumbent on thy heart, Permit the muse a cordial to impart; Who can to thee their tend'rest aid refuse? To dry thy tears how longs the heav'nly muse! AN HYMN TO THE MORNING. ATTEND my lays, ye ever honour'd nine, Assist my labours, and my strains refine; In smoothest numbers pour the notes along, For bright Aurora now demands my song. Aurora hail, and all the thousand dies, Which deck thy progress through the vaulted skies: The morn awakes, and wide extends her rays, On ev'ry leaf the gentle zephyr plays; Harmonious lays the feather'd race resume, Dart the bright eye, and shake the painted plume. Ye shady groves, your verdant gloom display To shield your poet from the burning day: Calliope awake the sacred lyre, While thy fair sisters fan the pleasing fire: The bow'rs, the gales, the variegated skies In all their pleasures in my bosom rise. See in the east th' illustrious king of day! His rising radiance drives the shades awayâ But Oh! I feel his fervid beams too strong, And scarce begun, concludes th' abortive song. AN HYMN TO THE EVENING. SOON as the sun forsook the eastern main The pealing thunder shook the heav'nly plain; Majestic grandeur! From the zephyr's wing, Exhales the incense of the blooming spring. Soft purl the streams, the birds renew their notes, And through the air their mingled music floats. Through all the heav'ns what beauteous dies are spread! But the west glories in the deepest red: So may our breasts with ev'ry virtue glow, The living temples of our God below! Fill'd with the praise of him who gives the light, And draws the sable curtains of the night, Let placid slumbers sooth each weary mind, At morn to wake more heav'nly, more refin'd; So shall the labours of the day begin More pure, more guarded from the snares of sin. Night's leaden sceptre seals my drousy eyes, Then cease, my song, till fair Aurora rise. ISAIAH LXIII. 1â8. SAY, heav'nly muse, what king, or mighty God, That moves sublime from Idumea's road? In Bozrah's dies, with martial glories join'd, His purple vesture waves upon the wind. Why thus enrob'd delights he to appear In the dread image of the Pow'r of war? Compres'd in wrath the swelling wine-press groan'd, It bled, and pour'd the gushing purple round. âMine was the act,â th' Almighty Saviour said, And shook the dazzling glories of his head, âWhen all forsook I trod the press alone, âAnd conquer'd by omnipotence my own; âFor man's release sustain'd the pond'rous load, âFor man the wrath of an immortal God: âTo execute th' Eternal's dread command âMy soul I sacrific'd with willing hand; âSinless I stood before the avenging frown, âAtoning thus for vices not my own.â His eye the ample field of battle round Survey'd, but no created succours found; His own omnipotence sustain'd the fight, His vengeance sunk the haughty foes in night; Beneath his feet the prostrate troops were spread, And round him lay the dying, and the dead. Great God, what light'ning flashes from thine eyes? What pow'r withstands if thou indignant rise? Against thy Zion though her foes may rage, And all their cunning, all their strength engage, Yet she serenely on thy bosom lies, Smiles at their arts, and all their force defies. ON RECOLLECTION. MNEME begin. Inspire, ye sacred nine, Your vent'rous Afric in her great design. Mneme, immortal pow'r, I trace thy spring: Assist my strains, while I thy glories sing: The acts of long departed years, by thee Recover'd, in due order rang'd we see: Thy pow'r the long-forgotten calls from night, That sweetly plays before the fancy's sight. Mneme in our nocturnal visions pours The ample treasure of her secret stores; Swift from above she wings her silent flight Through PhÅbe's realms, fair regent of the night; And, in her pomp of images display'd, To the high-raptur'd poet gives her aid, Through the unbounded regions of the mind, Diffusing light celestial and refin'd. The heav'nly phantom paints the actions done By ev'ry tribe beneath the rolling sun. Mneme, enthron'd within the human breast, Has vice condemn'd, and ev'ry virtue blest. How sweet the sound when we her plaudit hear? Sweeter than music to the ravish'd ear, Sweeter than Maro's entertaining strains Resounding through the groves, and hills, and plains. But how is Mneme dreaded by the race, Who scorn her warnings and despise her grace? By her unveil'd each horrid crime appears, Her awful hand a cup of wormwood bears. Days, years mispent, O what a hell of woe! Hers the worst tortures that our souls can know. Now eighteen years their destin'd course have run, In fast succession round the central sun. How did the follies of that period pass Unnotic'd, but behold them writ in brass! In Recollection see them fresh return, And sure 'tis mine to be asham'd, and mourn. O Virtue, smiling in immortal green, Do thou exert thy pow'r, and change the scene; Be thine employ to guide my future days, And mine to pay the tribute of my praise. Of Recollection such the pow'r enthron'd In ev'ry breast, and thus her pow'r is own'd. The wretch, who dar'd the vengeance of the skies, At last awakes in horror and surprize, By her alarm'd, he sees impending fate, He howls in anguish, and repents too late. But O! what peace, what joys are hers t' impart To ev'ry holy, ev'ry upright heart! Thrice blest the man, who, in her sacred shrine, Feels himself shelter'd from the wrath divine! ON IMAGINATION. THY various works, imperial queen, we see, How bright their forms! how deck'd with pomp by thee! Thy wond'rous acts in beauteous order stand, And all attest how potent is thine hand. From Helicon's refulgent heights attend, Ye sacred choir, and my attempts befriend: To tell her glories with a faithful tongue, Ye blooming graces, triumph in my song. Now here, now there, the roving Fancy flies, Till some lov'd object strikes her wand'ring eyes, Whose silken fetters all the senses bind, And soft captivity involves the mind. Imagination! who can sing thy force? Or who describe the swiftness of thy course? Soaring through air to find the bright abode, Th' empyreal palace of the thund'ring God, We on thy pinions can surpass the wind, And leave the rolling universe behind: From star to star the mental optics rove, Measure the skies, and range the realms above. There in one view we grasp the mighty whole, Or with new worlds amaze th' unbounded soul. Though Winter frowns to Fancy's raptur'd eyes The fields may flourish, and gay scenes arise; The frozen deeps may break their iron bands, And bid their waters murmur o'er the sands. Fair Flora may resume her fragrant reign, And with her flow'ry riches deck the plain; Sylvanus may diffuse his honours round, And all the forest may with leaves be crown'd: Show'rs may descend, and dews their gems disclose, And nectar sparkle on the blooming rose. Such is thy pow'r, nor are thine orders vain, O thou the leader of the mental train: In full perfection all thy works are wrought, And thine the sceptre o'er the realms of thought. Before thy throne the subject-passions bow, Of subject-passions sov'reign ruler Thou, At thy command joy rushes on the heart, And through the glowing veins the spirits dart. Fancy might now her silken pinions try To rise from earth, and sweep th' expanse on high; From Tithon's bed now might Aurora rise, Her cheeks all glowing with celestial dies, While a pure stream of light o'erflows the skies. The monarch of the day I might behold, And all the mountains tipt with radiant gold, But I reluctant leave the pleasing views, Which Fancy dresses to delight the Muse; Winter austere forbids me to aspire, And northern tempests damp the rising fire; They chill the tides of Fancy's flowing sea, Cease then, my song, cease the unequal lay. A FUNERAL POEM ON THE DEATH OF C. E. AN INFANT OF TWELVE MONTHS. THROUGH airy roads he wings his instant flight To purer regions of celestial light; Enlarg'd he sees unnumber'd systems roll, Beneath him sees the universal whole, Planets on planets run their destin'd round, And circling wonders fill the vast profound. Th' ethereal now, and now th' empyreal skies With growing splendors strike his wond'ring eyes: The angels view him with delight unknown, Press his soft hand, and seat him on his throne; Then smiling thus. âTo this divine abode, âThe seat of saints, of seraphs, and of God, âThrice welcome thou.â The raptur'd babe replies, âThanks to my God, who snatch'd me to the skies, âE'er vice triumphant had possess'd my heart, âE'er yet the tempter had beguil'd my heart, âE'er yet on sin's base actions I was bent, âE'er yet I knew temptation's dire intent; âE'er yet the lash for horrid crimes I felt, âE'er vanity had led my way to guilt, âBut, soon arriv'd at my celestial goal, âFull glories rush on my expanding soul.â Joyful he spoke: exulting cherubs round Clapt their glad wings, the heav'nly vaults resound. Say, parents, why this unavailing moan? Why heave your pensive bosoms with the groan? To Charles, the happy subject of my song, A brighter world, and nobler strains belong. Say would you tear him from the realms above By thoughtless wishes, and prepost'rous love? Doth his felicity increase your pain? Or could you welcome to this world again The heir of bliss? with a superior air Methinks he answers with a smile severe, âThrones and dominions cannot tempt me there.â But still you cry, âCan we the sigh forbear, âAnd still and still must we not pour the tear? âOur only hope, more dear than vital breath, âTwelve moons revolv'd, becomes the prey of death; âDelightful infant, nightly visions give âThee to our arms, and we with joy receive, âWe fain would clasp the Phantom to our breast, âThe Phantom flies, and leaves the soul unblest.â To yon bright regions let your faith ascend, Prepare to join your dearest infant friend In pleasures without measure, without end. TO CAPTAIN H?D, OF THE 65TH REGIMENT. SAY, muse divine, can hostile scenes delight The warrior's bosom in the fields of fight? Lo! here the christian, and the hero join With mutual grace to form the man divine. In H?d see with pleasure and surprize, Where valour kindles, and where virtue lies: Go, hero brave, still grace the post of fame, And add new glories to thine honour'd name, Still to the field, and still to virtue true: Britannia glories in no son like you. TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE WILLIAM, EARL OF DARTMOUTH, HIS MAJESTY'S PRINCIPAL SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTH-AMERICA, &amp;C. HAIL, happy day, when, smiling like the morn, Fair Freedom rose New-England to adorn: The northern clime beneath her genial ray, Dartmouth, congratulates thy blissful sway: Elate with hope her race no longer mourns, Each soul expands, each grateful bosom burns, While in thine hand with pleasure we behold The silken reins, and Freedom's charms unfold. Long lost to realms beneath the northern skies She shines supreme, while hated faction dies: Soon as appear'd the Goddess long desir'd, Sick at the view, she lanquish'd and expir'd; Thus from the splendors of the morning light The owl in sadness seeks the caves of night. No more, America, in mournful strain Of wrongs, and grievance unredress'd complain, No longer shalt thou dread the iron chain, Which wanton Tyranny with lawless hand Had made, and with it meant t' enslave the land. Should you, my lord, while you peruse my song, Wonder from whence my love of Freedom sprung, Whence flow these wishes for the common good, By feeling hearts alone best understood, I, young in life, by seeming cruel fate Was snatch'd from Afric's fancy'd happy seat: What pangs excruciating must molest, What sorrows labour in my parent's breast? Steel'd was that soul and by no misery mov'd That from a father seiz'd his babe belov'd: Such, such my case. And can I then but pray Others may never feel tyrannic sway? For favours past, great Sir, our thanks are due, And thee we ask thy favours to renew, Since in thy pow'r, as in thy will before, To sooth the griefs, which thou did'st once deplore. May heav'nly grace the sacred sanction give To all thy works, and thou for ever live Not only on the wings of fleeting Fame, Though praise immortal crowns the patriot's name, But to conduct to heav'ns refulgent fane, May fiery coursers sweep th' ethereal plain, And bear thee upwards to that blest abode, Where, like the prophet, thou shalt find thy God. ODE TO NEPTUNE. On Mrs. W?'s Voyage to England. I WHILE raging tempests shake the shore, While Ã'lus' thunders round us roar, And sweep impetuous o'er the plain Be still, O tyrant of the main; Nor let thy brow contracted frowns betray, While my Susannah skims the wat'ry way. II The Pow'r propitious hears the lay, The blue-ey'd daughters of the sea With sweeter cadence glide along, And Thames responsive joins the song. Pleas'd with their notes Sol sheds benign his ray, And double radiance decks the face of day. III To court thee to Britannia's arms Serene the climes and mild the sky, Her region boasts unnumber'd charms, Thy welcome smiles in ev'ry eye. Thy promise, Neptune keep, record my pray'r, Nor give my wishes to the empty air. Boston, October 10 1772. TO A LADY ON HER COMING TO NORTH-AMERICA WITH HER SON, FOR THE RECOVERY OF HER HEALTH. INdulgent muse! my grov'ling mind inspire, And fill my bosom with celestial fire. See from Jamaica's fervid shore she moves, Like the fair mother of the blooming loves, When from above the Goddess with her hand Fans the soft breeze, and lights upon the land; Thus she on Neptune's wat'ry reclin'd Appear'd, and thus invites the ling'ring wind. âArise, ye winds, America explore, âWaft me, ye gales, from this malignant shore; âThe Northern milder climes I long to greet, âThere hope that health will my arrival meet.â Soon as she spoke in my ideal view The winds assented, and the vessel flew. Madam, your spouse bereft of wife and son, In the grove's dark recesses pours his moan; Each branch, wide-spreading to the ambient sky, Forgets its verdure, and submits to die. From thence I turn, and leave the sultry plain, And swift pursue thy passage o'er the main: The ship arrives before the fav'ring wind, And makes the Philadelphian port assign'd, Thence I attend you to Bostonia's arms, Where gen'rous friendship ev'ry bosom warms: Thrice welcome here! may health revive again, Bloom on thy cheek, and bound in ev'ry vein! Then back return to gladden ev'ry heart, And give your spouse his soul's far dearer part, Receiv'd again with what a sweet surprize, The tear in transport starting from his eyes! While his attendant son with blooming grace Springs to his father's ever dear embrace. With shouts of joy Jamaica's rocks resound, With shouts of joy the country rings around. TO A LADY ON HER REMARKABLE PRESERVATION IN AN HURRICANE IN NORTH-CAROLINA. THOUGH thou did'st hear the tempest from afar, And felt'st the horrors of the wat'ry war, To me unknown, yet on this peaceful shore Methinks I hear the storm tumultuous roar, And how stern Boreas with impetuous hand Compell'd the Nereids to usurp the land. Reluctant rose the daughters of the main, And slow ascending glided o'er the plain, Till Ãolus in his rapid chariot drove In gloomy grandeur from the vault above: Furious he comes. His winged sons obey Their frantic sire, and madden all the sea. The billows rave, the wind's fierce tyrant roars, And with his thund'ring terrors shakes the shores: Broken by waves the vessel's frame is rent, And strows with planks the wat'ry element. But thee, Maria, a kind Nereid's shield Preserv'd from sinking, and thy form upheld: And sure some heav'nly oracle design'd At that dread crisis to instruct thy mind Things of eternal consequence to weigh, And to thine heart just feelings to convey Of things above, and of the future doom, And what the births of the dread world to come. From tossing seas I welcome thee to land. âResign her, Nereid,â 'twas thy God's command. Thy spouse late buried, as thy fears conceiv'd, Again returns, thy fears are all reliev'd: Thy daughter blooming with superior grace Again thou see'st, again thine arms embrace; O come, and joyful show thy spouse his heir, And what the blessings of maternal care! TO A LADY AND HER CHILDREN, ON THE DEATH OF HER SON AND THEIR BROTHER. O'Erwhelming sorrow now demands my song: From death the overwhelming sorrow sprung. What flowing tears? What hearts with grief opprest? What sighs on sighs heave the fond parent's breast? The brother weeps, the hapless sisters join Th' increasing woe, and swell the crystal brine; The poor, who once his gen'rous bounty fed, Droop, and bewail their benefactor dead. In death the friend, the kind companion lies, And in one death what various comfort dies! Th' unhappy mother sees the sanguine rill Forget to flow, and nature's wheels stand still, But see from earth his spirit far remov'd, And know no grief recals your best-belov'd: He, upon pinions swifter than the wind, Has left mortality's sad scenes behind For joys to this terrestrial state unknown, And glories richer than the monarch's crown. Of virtue's steady course the prize behold! What blissful wonders to his mind unfold! But of celestial joys I sing in vain: Attempt not, muse, the too advent'rous strain. No more in briny show'rs, ye friends around, Or bathe his clay, or waste them on the ground: Still do you weep, still wish for his return? How cruel thus to wish, and thus to mourn? No more for him the streams of sorrow pour, But haste to join him on the heav'nly shore, On harps of gold to tune immortal lays, And to your God immortal anthems raise. TO A GENTLEMAN AND LADY ON THE DEATH OF THE LADY'S BROTHER AND SISTER, AND A CHILD OF THE NAME AVIS, AGED ONE YEAR. ON Death's domain intent I fix my eyes, Where human nature in vast ruin lies: With pensive mind I search the drear abode, Where the great conqu'ror has his spoils, bestow'd; There there the offspring of six thousand years In endless numbers to my view appears: Whole kingdoms in his gloomy den are thrust, And nations mix with their primeval dust: Insatiate still he gluts the ample tomb; His is the present, his the age to come. See here a brother, here a sister spread, And a sweet daughter mingled with the dead. But, Madam, let your grief be laid aside, And let the fountain of your tears be dry'd, In vain they flow to wet the dusty plain, Your sighs are wafted to the skies in vain, Your pains they witness, but they can no more, While Death reigns tyrant o'er this mortal shore. The glowing stars and silver queen of light At last must perish in the gloom of night: Resign thy friends to that Almighty hand, Which gave them life, and bow to his command; Thine Avis give without a murm'ring heart, Though half thy soul be fated to depart. To shining guards consign thine infant care To waft triumphant through the seas of air: He soul enlarg'd to heav'nly pleasure springs, She feeds on truth and uncreated things. Methinks I hear her in the realms above, And leaning forward with a filial love, Invite you there to share immortal bliss Unknown, untasted in a state like this. With tow'ring hopes, and growing grace arise, And seek beatitude beyond the skies. ON THE DEATH OF DR. SAMUEL MARSHALL. 1771. THROUGH thickest glooms look back, immortal shade, On that confusion which thy death has made; Or from Olympus' height look down, and see A Town involv'd in grief bereft of thee. Thy Lucy sees thee mingle with the dead, And rends the graceful tresses from her head, Wild in her woe, with grief unknown opprest Sigh follows sigh deep heaving from her breast. Too quickly fled, ah! whither art thou gone? Ah! lost for ever to thy wife and son! The hapless child, thine only hope and heir, Clings round his mother's neck, and weeps his sorrows there. The loss of thee on Tyler's soul returns, And Boston for her dear physician mourns. When sickness call'd for Marshall's healing hand, With what compassion did his soul expand? In him we found the father and the friend: In life how lov'd! how honour'd in his end! And must not then our Ãsculapius stay To bring his ling'ring infant into day? The babe unborn in the dark womb is tost, And seems in anguish for its father lost. Gone is Apollo from his house of earth, But leaves the sweet memorials of his worth: The common parent, whom we all deplore, From yonder world unseen must come no more, Yet 'midst our woes immortal hopes attend The spouse, the sire, the universal friend. TO A GENTLEMAN ON HIS VOYAGE TO GREAT-BRITAIN FOR THE RECOVERY OF HIS HEALTH. WHILE others chant the gay Elysian scenes, Of balmy zephyrs, and of flow'ry plains, My song more happy speaks a greater name, Feels higher motives and a nobler flame. For thee, O R?, the muse attunes her strings, And mounts sublime above inferior things. I sing not now of green embow'ring woods, I sing not now the daughters of the floods, I sing not of the storms o'er ocean driv'n, And how they howl'd along the waste of heav'n, But I to R? would paint the British shore, And vast Atlantic, not untry'd before: Thy life impair'd commands thee to arise, Leave these bleak regions and inclement skies, Where chilling winds return the winter past, And nature shudders at the furious blast. O thou stupendous, earth-enclosing main Exert thy wonders to the world again! If ere thy pow'r prolong'd the fleeting breath, Turn'd back the shafts, and mock'd the gates of death, If ere thine air dispens'd an healing pow'r, Or snatch'd the victim from the fatal hour, This equal case demands thine equal care, And equal wonders may this patient share. But unavailing, frantic is the dream To hope thine aid without the aid of him Who gave thee birth, and taught thee where to flow, And in thy waves his various blessings show. May R? return to view his native shore Replete with vigour not his own before, Then shall we see with pleasure and surprize, And own thy work, great Ruler of the skies! TO THE REV. DR. THOMAS AMORY ON READING HIS SERMONS ON DAILY DEVOTION, IN WHICH THAT DUTY IS RECOMMENDED AND ASSISTED. TO cultivate in ev'ry noble mind Habitual grace, and sentiments refin'd, Thus while you strive to mend the human heart, Thus while the heav'nly precepts you impart, O may each bosom catch the sacred fire, And youthful minds to Virtue's throne aspire! When God's eternal ways you set in sight, And Virtue shines in all her native light, In vain would Vice her works in night conceal, For Wisdom's eye pervades the sable veil. Artists may paint the sun's effulgent rays, But Amory's pen the brighter God displays: While his great works in Amory's pages shine, And while he proves his essence all divine, The Atheist sure no more can boast aloud Of chance, or nature, and exclude the God; As if the clay without the potter's aid Should rise in various forms, and shapes self-made, Or worlds above with orb o'er orb profound Self-mov'd could run the everlasting round. It cannot beâunerring Wisdom guides With eye propitious, and o'er all presides. Still prosper, Amory! still may'st thou receive The warmest blessings which a muse can give, And when this transitory state is o'er, When kingdoms fall, and fleeting Fame's no more, May Amory triumph in immortal fame, A noble title, and superior name! ON THE DEATH OF J. C. AN INFANT. NO more the flow'ry scenes of pleasure rise, Nor charming prospects greet the mental eyes, No more with joy we view that lovely face Smiling, disportive, flush'd with ev'ry grace. The tear of sorrow flows from ev'ry eye, Groans answer groans, and sighs to sighs reply; What sudden pangs shot thro' each aching heart, When, Death, thy messenger dispatch'd his dart? Thy dread attendants, all-destroying Pow'r, Hurried the infant to his mortal hour. Could'st thou unpitying close those radiant eyes? Or fail'd his artless beauties to surprize? Could not his innocence thy stroke controul, Thy purpose shake, and soften all thy soul? The blooming babe, with shades of Death o'erspread, No more shall smile, no more shall raise its head, But, like a branch that from the tree is torn, Falls prostrate, wither'd, languid, and forlorn. âWhere flies my James?â 'tis thus I seem to hear The parent ask, âSome angel tell me where âHe wings his passage thro' the yielding air?â Methinks a cherub bending from the skies Observes the question, and serene replies, âIn heav'ns high palaces your babe appears: âPrepare to meet him, and dismiss your tears.â Shall not th' intelligence your grief restrain, And turn the mournful to the chearful strain? Cease your complaints, suspend each rising sigh, Cease to accuse the Ruler of the sky. Parents, no more indulge the falling tear: Let Faith to heav'n's refulgent domes repair, There see your infant, like a seraph glow: What charms celestial in his numbers flow Melodious, while the soul-enchanting strain Dwells on his tongue, and fills th'ethereal plain? Enoughâfor ever cease your murm'ring breath; Not as a foe, but friend converse with Death, Since to the port of happiness unknown He brought that treasure which you call your own. The gift of heav'n intrusted to your hand Chearful resign at the divine command: Not at your bar must sov'reign Wisdom stand. AN HYMN TO HUMANITY. TO S. P. G. ESQ; I LO! for this dark terrestrial ball Forsakes his azure-paved hall A prince of heav'nly birth! Divine Humanity behold. What wonders rise, what charms unfold At his descent to earth! II The bosoms of the great and good With wonder and delight he view'd, And fix'd his empire there: Him, close compressing to his breast, The sire of gods and men address'd, âMy son, my heav'nly fair! III âDescend to earth, there place thy throne; âTo succour man's afflicted son âEach human heart inspire: âTo act in bounties unconfin'd âEnlarge the close contracted mind, âAnd fill it with thy fire.â IV Quick as the word, with swift career He wings his course from star to star, And leaves the bright abode. The Virtue did his charms impart; Their G?y! then thy raptur'd heart Perceiv'd the rushing God: V For when thy pitying eye did see The languid muse in low degree, Then, then at thy desire Descended the celestial nine; O'er me methought they deign'd to shine, And deign'd to string my lyre. VI Can Afric's muse forgetful prove? Or can such friendship fail to move A tender human heart? Immortal Friendship laurel-crown'd The smiling Graces all surround With ev'ry heav'nly Art. TO THE HONOURABLE T. H. ESQ; ON THE DEATH OF HIS DAUGHTER. WHILE deep you mourn beneath the cypress-shade The hand of Death, and your dear daughter laid In dust, whose absence gives your tears to flow, And racks your bosom with incessant woe, Let Recollection take a tender part, Assuage the raging tortures of your heart, Still the wild tempest of tumultuous grief, And pour the heav'nly nectar of relief: Suspend the sigh, dear Sir, and check the groan, Divinely bright your daughter's Virtues shone: How free from scornful pride her gentle mind, Which ne'er its aid to indigence declin'd! Expanding free, it sought the means to prove Unfailing charity, unbounded love! She unreluctant flies to see no more Her dear-lov'd parents on earth's dusky shore: Impatient heav'n's resplendent goal to gain, She with swift progress cuts the azure plain, Where grief subsides, where changes are no more, And life's tumultuous billows cease to roar; She leaves her earthly mansion for the skies, Where new creations feast her wond'ring eyes. To heav'n's high mandate chearfully resign'd She mounts, and leaves the rolling globe behind; She, who late wish'd that Leonard might return, Has ceas'd to languish, and forgot to mourn; To the same high empyreal mansions come, She joins her spouse, and smiles upon the tomb: And thus I hear her from the realms above: âLo! this the kingdom of celestial love! âCould ye, fond parents, see our present bliss, âHow soon would you each sigh, each fear dismiss? âAmidst unutter'd pleasures whilst I play âIn the fair sunshine of celestial day, âAs far as grief affects an happy soul âSo far doth grief my better mind controul, âTo see on earth my aged parents mourn, âAnd secret wish for T?l to return: âLet brighter scenes your ev'ning-hours employ: âConverse with heav'n, and taste the promis'd joy.â NIOBE IN DISTRESS FOR HER CHILDREN SLAIN BY APOLLO, FROM OVID'S METAMORPHOSES, BOOK VI. AND FROM A VIEW OF THE PAINTING OF MR. RICHARD WILSON. APOLLO'S wrath to man the dreadful spring Of ills innum'rous, tuneful goddess, sing! Thou who did'st first th' ideal pencil give, And taught'st the painter in his works to live, Inspire with glowing energy of thought, What Wilson painted, and what Ovid wrote. Muse! lend thy aid, nor let me sue in vain, Tho' last and meanest of the rhyming train! O guide my pen in lofty strains to show The Phrygian queen, all beautiful in woe. 'Twas where MÃ¦onia spreads her wide domain Niobe dwelt, and held her potent reign: See in her hand the regal sceptre shine, The wealthy heir of Tantalus divine, He most distinguish'd by Dodonean Jove, To approach the tables of the gods above: Her grandsire Atlas, who with mighty pains Th' ethereal axis on his neck sustains: Her other gran sire on the throne on high Rolls the loud-pealing thunder thro' the sky. Her spouse, Amphion, who from Jove too springs, Divinely taught to sweep the sounding strings. Seven sprightly sons the royal bed adorn, Seven daughters beauteous as the op'ning morn, As when Aurora fills the ravish'd sight, And decks the orient realms with rosy light From their bright eyes the living splendors play, Nor can beholders bear the flashing ray. Wherever, Niobe, thou turn'st thine eyes, New beauties kindle, and new joys arise! But thou had'st far the happier mother prov'd, If this fair offspring had been less belov'd: What if their charms exceed Aurora's teint, No words could tell them, and no pencil paint, Thy love too vehement hastens to destroy Each blooming maid, and each celestial boy. Now Manto comes, endu'd with mighty skill, The past to explore, the future to reveal. Thro' Thebes' wide streets Tiresia's daughter came, Divine Latona's mandate to proclaim: The Theban maids to hear the orders ran, When thus MÅonia's prophetess began: âGo Thebans! great Latona's will obey, âAnd pious tribute at her altars pay: âWith rights divine, the goddess be implor'd, âNor be her sacred offspring unador'd.â Thus Manto spoke. The Theban maids obey, And pious tribute to the goddess pay. The rich perfumes ascend in waving spires, And altars blaze with consecrated fires; The fair assembly moves with graceful air, And leaves of laurel bind the flowing hair. Niobe comes with all her royal race, With charms unnumber'd, and superior grace: Her Phrygian garments of delightful hue, Inwove with gold, refulgent to the view, Beyond description beautiful she moves Like heav'nly Venus, 'midst her smiles and loves: She views around the supplicating train, And shakes her graceful head with stern disdain, Proudly she turns around her lofty eyes, And thus reviles celestial deities: âWhat madness drives the Theban ladies fair âTo give their incense to surrounding air? âSay why this new sprung deity preferr'd? âWhy vainly fancy your petitions heard? âOr say why CÅus' offspring is obey'd, âWhile to my goddesship no tribute's paid? âFor me no altars blaze with living fires, âNo bullock bleeds, no frankincense transpires, âTho' Cadmus' palace, not unknown to fame, âAnd Phrygian nations all revere my name. âWhere'er I turn my eyes vast wealth I find. âLo! here an empress with a goddess join'd. âWhat, shall a Titaness be deify'd, âTo whom the spacious earth a couch deny'd? âNor heav'n, nor earth, nor sea receiv'd your queen, â'Till pitying Delos took the wand'rer in. âRound me what a large progeny is spread! âNo frowns of fortune has my soul to dread. âWhat if indignant she decrease my train âMore than Latona's number will remain? âThen hence, ye Theban dames, hence haste away, âNor longer off'rings to Latona pay? âRegard the orders of Amphion's spouse, âAnd take the leaves of laurel from your brows.â Niobe spoke. The Theban maids obey'd, Their brows unbound, and left the rights unpaid. The angry goddess heard, then silence broke On Cynthus' summit, and indignant spoke; âPhÅbus! behold, thy mother in disgrace, âWho to no goddess yields the prior place âExcept to Juno's self, who reigns above, âThe spouse and sister of the thund'ring Jove. âNiobe sprung from Tantalus inspires âEach Theban bosom with rebellious fires; âNo reason her imperious temper quells, âBut all her father in her tongue rebels; âWrap her own sons for her blaspheming breath, âApollo! wrap them in the shades of death.â Latona ceas'd and ardent thus replies, The God, whose glory decks th' expanded skies. âCease thy complaints, mine be the task assign'd âTo punish pride, and scourge the rebel mind.â This PhÅbe join'd.âThey wing their instant flight; Thebes trembled as th' immortal pow'rs alight. With clouds incompass'd glorious PhÅbus stands; The feather'd vengeance quiv'ring in his hands. Near Cadmus' walls a plain extended lay, Where Thebes' young princes pass'd in sport the day: There the bold coursers bounded o'er the plains, While their great masters held the golden reins. Ismenus first the racing pastime led, And rul'd the fury of his flying steed. âAh me,â he sudden cries, with shrieking breath, While in his breast he feels the shaft of death; He drops the bridle on his courser's mane, Before his eyes in shadows swims the plain, He, the first-born of great Amphion's bed, Was struck the first, first mingled with the dead. Then didst thou, Sipylus, the language hear Of fate portentous whistling in the air: As when th' impending storm the sailor sees He spreads his canvas to the fav'ring breeze, So to thine horse thou gav'st the golden reins, Gav'st him to rush impetuous o'er the plains: But ah! a fatal shaft from PhÅbus' hand Smites through thy neck, and sinks thee on the sand. Two other brothers were at wrestling found, And in their pastime claspt each other round: A shaft that instant from Apollo's hand Transfixt them both, and stretcht them on the sand: Together they their cruel fate bemoan'd, Together languish'd, and together groan'd: Together too th' unbodied spirits fled, And sought the gloomy mansions of the dead. Alphenor saw, and trembling at the view, Beat his torn breast, that chang'd its snowy hue. He flies to raise them in a kind embrace; A brother's fondness triumphs in his face: Alphenor fails in this fraternal deed, A dart dispatch'd him (so the fates decreed:) Soon as the arrow left the deadly wound, His issuing entrails smoak'd upon the ground. What woes on blooming Damasichon wait! His sighs portend his near impending fate. Just where the well-made leg begins to be, And the soft sinews form the supple knee, The youth sore wounded by the Delian god Attempts t' extract the crime-avenging rod, But, whilst he strives the will of fate t' avert, Divine Apollo sends a second dart; Swift thro' his throat the feather'd mischief flies, Bereft of sense, he drops his head, and dies. Young Ilioneus, the last, directs his pray'r, And cries, âMy life, ye gods celestial! spare.â Apollo heard, and pity touch'd his heart, But ah! too late, for he had sent the dart: Thou too, O Ilioneus, art doom'd to fall, The fates refuse that arrow to recal. On the swift wings of ever-flying Fame To Cadmus' palace soon the tidings came: Niobe heard, and with indignant eyes She thus express'd her anger and surprize: âWhy is such privilege to them allow'd? âWhy thus insulted by the Delian god? âDwells there such mischief in the pow'rs above? âWhy sleeps the vengeance of immortal Jove?â For now Amphion too, with grief oppress'd, Had plung'd the deadly dagger in his breast. Niobe now, less haughty than before, With lofty head directs her steps no more. She, who late told her pedigree divine, And drove the Thebans from Latona's shrine, How strangely chang'd!âyet beautiful in woe, She weeps, nor weeps unpity'd by the foe. On each pale corse the wretched mother spread Lay overwhelm'd with grief, and kiss'd her dead, Then rais'd her arms, and thus, in accents slow, âBe sated cruel Goddess! with my woe; âIf I've offended, let these streaming eyes, âAnd let this sev'nfold funeral suffice: âAh! take this wretched life you deign'd to save, âWith them I too am carried to the grave. âRejoice triumphant, my victorious foe, âBut show the cause from whence your triumphs flow? âTho' I unhappy mourn these children slain, âYet greater numbers to my lot remain.â She ceas'd, the bow string twang'd with awful sound, Which struck with terror all th' assembly round, Except the queen, who stood unmov'd alone, By her distresses more presumptuous grown. Near the pale corses stood their sisters fair In sable vestures and dishevell'd hair; One, while she draws the fatal shaft away, Faints, falls, and sickens at the light of day. To sooth her mother, lo! another flies, And blames the fury of inclement skies, And, while her words a filial pity show, Struck dumbâindignant seeks the shades below. Now from the fatal place another flies, Falls in her flight, and languishes, and dies. Another on her sister drops in death; A fifth in trembling terrors yields her breath; While the sixth seeks some gloomy cave in vain, Struck with the rest, and mingled with the slain. One only daughter lives, and she the least; The queen close clasp'd the daughter to her breast: âYe heav'nly pow'rs, ah spare me one,â she cry'd, âAh! spare me one,â the vocal hills reply'd: In vain she begs, the Fates her suit deny, In her embrace she sees her daughter die. This Verse to the End is the Work of another Hand.âThe queen of all her family bereft, âWithout or husband, son, or daughter left, âGrew stupid at the shock. The passing air âMade no impression on her stiff'ning hair. âThe blood forsook her face: amidst the flood âPour'd from her cheeks, quite fix'd her eye-balls stood. âHer tongue, her palate both obdurate grew, âHer curdled veins no longer motion knew; âThe use of neck, and arms, and feet was gone, âAnd ev'n her bowels hard'ned into stone: âA marble statue now the queen appears, âBut from the marble steal the silent tears.â TO S. M. A YOUNG AFRICAN PAINTER, ON SEEING HIS WORKS. TO show the lab'ring bosom's deep intent, And thought in living characters to paint, When first thy pencil did those beauties give, And breathing figures learnt from thee to live, How did those prospects give my soul delight, A new creation rushing on my sight? Still, wond'rous youth! each noble path pursue, On deathless glories fix thine ardent view: Still may the painter's and the poet's fire To aid thy pencil, and thy verse conspire! And may the charms of each seraphic theme Conduct thy footsteps to immortal fame! High to the blissful wonders of the skies Elate thy soul, and raise thy wishful eyes. Thrice happy, when exalted to survey That splendid city, crown'd with endless day, Whose twice six gates on radiant hinges ring: Celestial Salem blooms in endless spring. Calm and serene thy moments glide along, And may the muse inspire each future song! Still, with the sweets of contemplation bless'd, May peace with balmy wings your soul invest! But when these shades of time are chas'd away, And darkness ends in everlasting day, On what seraphic pinions shall we move, And view the landscapes in the realms above? There shall thy tongue in heav'nly murmurs flow, And there my muse with heav'nly transport glow: No more to tell of Damon's tender sighs, Or rising radiance of Aurora's eyes, For nobler themes demand a nobler strain, And purer language on th' ethereal plain. Cease, gentle muse! the solemn gloom of night Now seals the fair creation from my sight. TO HIS HONOUR THE LIEUTENANT-GOVERNOR, ON THE DEATH OF HIS LADY. MARCH 24, 1773. ALL-conquering Death! by thy resistless pow'r, Hope's tow'ring plumage falls to rise no more! Of scenes terrestrial how the glories fly, Forget their splendors, and submit to die! Who ere escap'd thee, but the saint Enoch. of old Beyond the flood in sacred annals told, And the great sage, Elijah. whom fiery courses drew To heav'n's bright portals from Elisha's view; Wond'ring he gaz'd at the refulgent car, Then snatch'd the mantle floating on the air. From Death these only could exemption boast, And without dying gain'd th' immortal coast. Not falling millions sate the tyrant's mind, Nor can the victor's progress be confin'd. But cease thy strife with Death, fond Nature, cease: He leads the virtuous to the realms of peace; His to conduct to the immortal plains, Where heav'n's Supreme in bliss and glory reigns. There sits, illustrious Sir, thy beauteous spouse; A gem-blaz'd circle beaming on her brows. Hail'd with acclaim among the heav'nly choirs, Her soul new-kindling with seraphic fires, To notes divine she tunes the vocal strings, While heav'n's high concave with the music rings. Virtue's rewards can mortal pencil paint? Noâall descriptive arts, and eloquence are faint; Nor canst thou, Oliver, assent refuse To heav'nly tidings from the Afric muse. As soon may change thy laws, eternal fate, As the saint miss the glories I relate; Or her Benevolence forgotten lie, Which wip'd the trick'ling tear from Mis'ry's eye. Whene'er the adverse winds were known to blow, When loss to loss Three amiable Daughters who died when just arrived to Womens Estate. ensu'd, and woe to woe, Calm and serene beneath her father's hand She sat resign'd to the divine command. No longer then, great Sir, her death deplore, And let us hear the mournful sigh no more, Restrain the sorrow streaming from thine eye, Be all thy future moments crown'd with joy! Nor let thy wishes be to earth confin'd, But soaring high pursue th' unbodied mind. Forgive the muse, forgive th' advent'rous lays, That fain thy soul to heav'nly scenes would raise. A FAREWEL TO AMERICA. TO MRS. S.W. I ADIEU, New-England's smiling meads, Adieu, the flow'ry plain: I leave thine op'ning charms, O spring, And tempt the roaring main. II In vain for me the flow'rets rise, And boast their gaudy pride, While here beneath the northern skies I mourn for health deny'd. III Celestial maid of rosy hue, O let me feel thy reign! I languish till thy face I view, Thy vanish'd joys regain. IV Susannah mourns, nor can I bear To see the crystal show'r, Or mark the tender falling tear At sad departure's hour; V Nor unregarding can I see Her soul with grief opprest: But let no sighs, no groans for me, Steal from her pensive breast. VI In vain the feather'd warblers sing, In vain the garden blooms, And on the bosom of the spring Breathes out her sweet perfumes, VII While for Britannia's distant shore We sweep the liquid plain, And with astonish'd eyes explore The wide-extended main. VIII Lo! Health appears! celestial dame! Complacent and serene, With Hebe's mantle o'er her Frame, With soul-delighting mein. IX To mark the vale where London lies With misty vapours crown'd, Which cloud Aurora's thousand dyes, And veil her charms around, X Why, PhÅbus, moves thy car so slow? So slow thy rising ray? Give us the famous town to view Thou glorious king of day! XI For thee, Britannia, I resign New-England's smiling fields; To view again her charms divine, What joy the prospect yields! XII But thou! Temptation hence away, With all thy fatal train Nor once seduce my soul away, By thine enchanting strain. XIII Thrice happy they, whose heav'nly shield Secures their souls from harms, And fell Temptation on the field Of all its pow'r disarms! Boston, May 7, 1773. A REBUS, BY I. B. I A BIRD delicious to the taste, On which an army once did feast, Sent by an hand unseen; A creature of the horned race, Which Britain's royal standards grace; A gem of vivid green; II A town of gaiety and sport, Where beaux and beauteous nymphs resort, And gallantry doth reign; A Dardan hero fam'd of old For youth and beauty, as we're told, And by a monarch slain; III A peer of popular applause, Who doth our violated laws, And grievances proclaim. The' initials show a vanquish'd town, That adds fresh glory and renown To old Britannia's fame. AN ANSWER TO THE REBUS, BY THE AUTHOR OF THESE POEMS. THE poet asks, and Phillis can't refuse To shew th'obedience of the Infant muse. She knows the Quail of most inviting taste Fed Israel's army in the dreary waste; And what's on Britain's royal standard borne, But the tall, graceful, rampant Unicorn? The Emerald with a vivid verdure glows Among the gems which regal crowns compose; Boston's a town, polite and debonair, To which the beaux and beauteous nymphs repair, Each Helen strikes the mind with sweet surprise, While living lightning flashes from her eyes. See young Euphorbus of the Dardan line By Menelaus' hand to death resign: The well known peer of popular applause Is C?m zealous to support our laws. Quebec now vanquish'd must obey, She too must annual tribute pay To Britain of immortal fame, And add new glory to her name. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Other Poems and Variants of Poems ON MESSRS HUSSEY AND COFFIN. TO THE PRINTER. Please to insert the following Lines, composed by a Negro Girl (belonging to one Mr. Wheatley of Boston) on the following Occasion, viz. Messrs Hussey and Coffin, as undermentioned, belonging to Nantucket, being bound from thence to Boston, narrowly escaped being cast away on Cape-Cod, in one of the late Storms; upon their Arrival, being at Mr. Wheatley's, and, while at Dinner, told of their narrow Escape, this Negro Girl at the same Time 'tending Table, heard the Relation, from which she composed the following Verses. Did Fear and Danger so perplex your Mind, As made you fearful of the Whistling Wind? Was it not Boreas knit his angry Brow Against you? or did Consideration bow? To lend you Aid, did not his Winds combine? To stop your passage with a churlish Line, Did haughty Eolus with Contempt look down With Aspect windy, and a study'd Frown? Regard them not;âthe Great Supreme, the Wise, Intends for something hidden from our Eyes. Suppose the groundless Gulph had snatch'd away Hussey and Coffin to the raging Sea; Where wou'd they go? where wou'd be their Abode? With the supreme and independent God, Or made their Beds down in the Shades below, Where neither Pleasure nor Content can flow. To Heaven their Souls with eager Raptures soar, Enjoy the Bliss of him they wou'd adore. Had the soft gliding Streams of Grace been near, Some favourite Hope their fainting hearts to cheer, Doubtless the Fear of Danger far had fled: No more repeated Victory crown their Heads. Had I the Tongue of a Seraphim, how would I exalt thy Praise; thy Name as Incense to the Heavens should fly, and the Remembrance of thy Goodness to the shoreless Ocean of Beatitude!âThen should the Earth glow with seraphick Ardour. Blest Soul, which sees the Day while Light doth shine, To guide his Steps to trace the Mark divine. Phillis Wheatley. TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE, WROTE IN 1767â While an intrinsic ardor bids me write The muse doth promise to assist my pen. 'Twas but e'en now I left my native Shore The sable Land of error's darkest night There, sacred Nine! for you no place was found, Parent of mercy, 'twas thy Powerfull hand Brought me in Safety from the dark abode.

Still more, ye Sons of Science! you've reciev'd The pleasing Sound by messengers from heav'n, The Saviour's blood, for your Redemption flows. S[ee] Him, with hands stretch'd out upon the Cross! Divine compassion in his bosom glows. He hears revilers with oblique regard. What Condescention in the Son of God! When the whole human race, by Sin had fal'n; He deign'd to Die, that they might rise again, To live with him beyond the Starry Sky Life without death, and Glory without End.â Improve your privileges while they Stay: Caress, redeem each moment, which with haste Bears on its rapid wing Eternal bliss. Let hateful vice so baneful to the Soul, Be still avoided with becoming care; Suppress the sable monster in its growth, Ye blooming plants of human race, divine An Ethiop tells you, tis your greatest foe Its present sweetness turns to endless pain And brings eternal ruin on the Soul.

Pains his companions, and his friends distress Immanuel on the cross those pains did bearâ Will the eternal our petitions hear?

While thus we beg thy excellence to feel, Thy Sacred Spirit, in our hearts reveal And make each one of us, that grace partake Which thus we ask for the Redeemer's Sake âSewall is dead.â Swift pinion'd fame thus cry'd. Is Sewall dead?â my trembling heart reply'd O what a blessing in thy flight deny'd!

How oft for us this holy Prophet pray'd; But ah! behold him in his Clay-cold bed By duty urg'd, my weeping verse to close, I'll on his Tomb, an Epitaph compose. Lo! here, a man bought with Christ's precious blood Once a poor Sinner, now a Saint with God.â Behold ye rich and poor, and fools and wise; Nor Let this monitor your hearts Surprize! I'll tell you all, what this great Saint has done Which makes him Brighter than the Glorious Sun.â Listen ye happy from your Seats above I Speak Sincerely and with truth and Love. He Sought the Paths of virtue and of Truth Twas this which made him happy in his Youth. In Blooming years he found that grace divine Which gives admittance to the sacred Shrine. Mourn him, ye Indigent, Whom he has fed, Seek yet more earnest for the living Bread: E'en Christ your Bread, who cometh from above Implore his pity and his grace and Love. Mourn him ye Youth, whom he hath often told God's bounteous Mercy from the times of Old. I too, have cause this mighty loss to mourn For this my monitor will not return. Now this faint Semblance of his life complete He is, thro' Jesus, made divinely great And left a glorious pattern to repeat But when Shall we, to this bless'd State arrive? When the same graces in our hearts do thrive.

To thee complaints of grievance are unknown; We hear no more the music of thy tongue, Thy wonted auditories cease to throng. Thy lessons in unequal'd accents flow'd! While emulation in each bosom glow'd; Thou didst, in strains of eloquence refin'd, Inflame the soul, and captivate the mind. Unhappy we, the setting Sun deplore! Which once was splendid, but it shines no more; He leaves this earth for Heaven's unmeasur'd height: And worlds unknown, receive him from our sight; There WHITEFIELD wings, with rapid course his way, And sails to Zion, through vast seas of day. When his AMERICANS were burden'd sore, When streets were crimson'd with their guiltless gore! Unrival'd friendship in his breast now strove: The fruit thereof was charity and love Towards Americaâcouldst thou do more Than leave thy native home, the British shore, To cross the great Atlantic's wat'ry road, To see America's distress'd abode? Thy prayers, great Saint, and thy incessant cries, Have pierc'd the bosom of thy native skies! Thou moon hast seen, and ye bright stars of light Have witness been of his requests by night! He pray'd that grace in every heart might dwell: He long'd to see America excell; He charg'd its youth to let the grace divine Arise, and in their future actions shine; He offer'd THAT he did himself receive, A greater gift not GOD himself can give: He urg'd the need of HIM to every one; It was no less than GOD's co-equal SON! Take HIM ye wretched for your only good; Take HIM ye starving souls to be your food. Ye thirsty, come to his life giving stream: Ye Preachers, take him for your joyful theme: Take HIM, âmy dear AMERICANS,â he said, Be your complaints in his kind bosom laid: Take HIM ye Africans, he longs for you; Impartial SAVIOUR, is his title due; If you will chuse to walk in grace's road, You shall be sons, and kings, and priests to GOD. Great COUNTESS! we Americans revere Thy name, and thus condole thy grief sincere: We mourn with thee, that TOMB obscurely plac'd, In which thy Chaplain undisturb'd doth rest. New-England sure, doth feel the ORPHAN's smart; Reveals the true sensations of his heart: Since this fair Sun, withdraws his golden rays, No more to brighten these distressful days! His lonely Tabernacle, sees no more A WHITEFIELD landing on the British shore: Then let us view him in yon azure skies: Let every mind with this lov'd object rise. No more can he exert his lab'ring breath, Seiz'd by the cruel messenger of death. What can his dear AMERICA return? But drop a tear upon his happy urn, Thou tomb, shalt safe retain thy sacred trust, Till life divine re-animate his dust. Sold by EZEKIEL RUSSELL, in Queen-Street, and JOHN BOYLES, in Marlboro-Street. AN ODE OF VERSES On the much-lamented Death of the REV. MR. GEORGE WHITEFIELD, Late Chaplain to the Countess of Huntingdon; Who departed this Life, at Newberry near Boston in New England, on the Thirtieth of September, 1770, in the Fifty-seventh Year of his Age. Compos'd in America by a Negro Girl Seventeen Years of Age, and sent over to a Gentleman of Character in London. HAIL Happy Saint, on thy Immortal Throne! To thee Complaints of Grievance are unknown. We hear no more the Music of thy Tongue, Thy wonted Auditories cease to throng. Thy Lessons in unequal'd Accents flow'd, While Emulation in each Bosom glow'd. Thou didst, in Strains of Eloquence refin'd, Inflame the Soul, and captivate the Mind. Unhappy we thy setting Sun deplore, Which once was splendid, but it shines no more. He leaves the Earth for Heaven's unmeasur'd Height, And Worlds unknown receive him out of Sight. There Whitefield wings with rapid Course his Way, And sails to Zion thro' vast Seas of Day. When his Americans were burthen'd sore, When Streets were crimson'd with their guiltless Gore, Wond'rous Compassion in his Breast now strove, The Fruit thereof was Charity and Love. Towards America what could he more! Than leave his native Home, the British Shore, To cross the Great Atlantick wat'ry Road, To see New England's much-distress'd Abode. Thy Prayers, great Saint, and thy incessant Cries, Have often pierc'd the Bosom of the Skies. Thou, Moon, hast seen, and thou, bright Star of Light, Hast Witness been of his Requests by Night. He pray'd for Grace in ev'ry Heart to dwell, He long'd to see America excel. He charg'd its Youth to let the Grace Divine Arise, and in their future Actions shine. He offer'd that he did himself receive: A greater Gift not God himself could give. He urg'd the Need of Him to ev'ry one, It was no less than God's co-equal Son. Take him, ye Wretched, for your only Good; Take him, ye hungry Souls, to be your Food; Take him, ye Thirsty, for your cooling Stream; Ye Preachers, take him for your joyful Theme; Take him, my dear Americans, he said, Be your Complaints in his kind Bosom laid; Take him, ye Africans, he longs for you, Impartial Saviour is his Title due. If you will walk in Grace's heavenly Road, He'll make you free, and Kings, and Priests to God. No more can he exert his lab'ring Breath, Seiz'd by the cruel Messenger of Death. What can his dear America return, But drop a Tear upon his happy Urn. Thou, Tomb, shalt safe retain thy sacred Trust, Till Life Divine reanimate his Dust. Our Whitefield the Haven has gain'd, Outflying the Tempest and Wind; His Rest he has sooner obtain'd, And left his Companions behind. With Songs let us follow his Flight, And mount with his Spirit above; Escap'd to the Mansions of Light, And lodg'd in the Eden of Love. THE CONCLUSION. May Whitefield's Virtues flourish with his Fame, And Ages yet unborn record his Name. All Praise and Glory be to God on High, Whose dread Command is, That we all must die. To live to Life eternal, may we emulate The worthy Man that's gone, e'er tis too late.

GRIM Monarch! see depriv'd of vital breath, A young Physician in the dust of death! Dost thou go on incessant to destroy: The grief to double, and impair the joy? Enough thou never yet wast known to say, Tho' millions die thy mandate to obey. Nor youth, nor science nor the charms of love, Nor aught on earth thy rocky heart can move. The friend, the spouse, from his dark realm to save, In vain we ask the tyrant of the grave. Fair mourner, there see thy own LEONARD spread, Lies undistinguish'd from the vulgar dead; Clos'd are his eyes, eternal slumbers keep, His senses bound in never-waking sleep, Till time shall cease; till many a shining world, Shall fall from Heav'n, in dire confusion hurl'd: Till dying Nature in wild torture lies; Till her last groans shall rend the brazen skies! And not till then, his active Soul shall claim, Its body, now, of more than mortal frame. But ah! methinks the rolling tears apace, Pursue each other down the alter'd face. Ah! cease ye sighs, nor rend the mourner's heart: Cease thy complaints, no more thy griefs impart. From the cold shell of his great soul arise! And look above, thou native of the skies! There fix thy view, where fleeter than the wind Thy LEONARD flies, and leaves the earth behind. Thyself prepare to pass the gloomy night, To join forever in the fields of light; To thy embrace, his joyful spirit moves, To thee the partner of his earthly loves; He welcomes thee to pleasures more refin'd And better suited to the deathless mind. Phillis Wheatley. ON THE DEATH OF DR. SAMUEL MARSHALL Thro' thickest glooms, Look back, immortal Shade; On that confusion which thy flight hath made. Or from Olympus height, look down, and see, A Town involv'd in grief, bereft of thee. His Lucy sees him mix among the Dead, And rends the gracefull tresses from her head. Frantic with woe, with griefs unknown, oppress'd, Sigh follows Sigh, and heaves the downy breast; Too quickly fled, ah! whither art thou gone? Ah! lost forever to thy wife and son! The hapless child, thy only hope, and heir, Clings round the neck, and weeps his Sorrows there The loss of thee, on Tyler's Soul returns. And Boston too, for her Physician mourns. When Sickness call'd for Marshall's kindly hand, Lo! how with pitty would his heart expand! The Sire, the friend in him we oft have found; With gen'rous friendship, did his Soul abound. Could Esculapius then no Longer stay, To bring his lingring Infant in to Day? The Babe unborn, in dark confiens is toss'd And Seems in anguish for its Father Lost. Gone is Apollo! from his house of earth! And leaves the memorial of his worth. From yonder worlds unseen he Comes no more, The common parent, whom we thus deplore: Yet in our hopes, immortal Joys attend, The Sire, the Spouse, the universal freind.

There is in this town a young Negro woman, who left her country at ten years of age, and has been in this eight years. She is a compleat sempstress, an accomplished mistress of her pen, and discovers a most surprising genius. Some of her productions have seen the light, among which is a poem on the death of the Rev. Mr. George Whitefield.âThe following was occasioned by her being in company with some young ladies of family, when one of them said she did not remember, among all the poetical pieces she had seen, ever to have met with a poem upon RECOLLECTION. The African (so let me call her, for so in fact she is) took the hint, went home to her master's, and soon sent what follows. âMADAM, âAgreeable to your proposing Recollection as a subject proper for me to write upon, I enclose these few thoughts upon it; and, as you was the first person who mentioned it, I thought none more proper to dedicate it to; and, if it meets with your approbation, the poem is honoured, and the authoress satisfied. I am, Madam, Your very humble servant, PHILLIS.â To Miss A? M?, humbly inscribed by the Authoress. MNEME, begin; inspire, ye sacred Nine! Your vent'rous Afric in the deep design. Do ye rekindle the cÅlestial fire, Ye god-like powers! the glowing thoughts inspire, Immortal Pow'r! I trace thy sacred spring, Assist my strains, while I thy glories sing. By thee, past acts of many thousand years, Rang'd in due order, to the mind appears; The long-forgot thy gentle hand conveys, Returns, and soft upon the fancy plays. Calm, in the visions of the night he pours Th' exhaustless treasures of his secret stores. Swift from above he wings his downy flight Thro' PhÅbe's realm, fair regent of the night. Thence to the raptur'd poet gives his aid, Dwells in his heart, or hovers round his head; To give instruction to the lab'ring mind, Diffusing light cÅlestial and refin'd. Still he pursues, unweary'd in the race, And wraps his senses in the pleasing maze. The Heav'nly Phantom points the actions done In the past worlds, and tribes beneath the sun. He, from his throne in ev'ry human breast, Has vice condemn'd, and ev'ry virtue bless'd. Sweet are the sounds in which thy words we hear, CÅlestial musick to the ravish'd ear. We hear thy voice, resounding o'er the plains, Excelling Maro's sweet Menellian strains. But awful Thou! to that perfidious race, Who scorn thy warnings, nor the good embrace; By Thee unveil'd, the horrid crime appears, Thy mighty hand redoubled fury bears; The time mis-spent augments their hell of woes, While through each breast the dire contagion flows. Now turn and leave the rude ungraceful scene, And paint fair Virtue in immortal green. For ever flourish in the glowing veins, For ever flourish in poetick strains. Be Thy employ to guide my early days, And Thine the tribute of my youthful lays. Now Her age. eighteen years their destin'd course have run, In due succession, round the central sun; How did each folly unregarded pass! But sure 'tis graven on eternal brass! To recollect, inglorious I return; 'Tis mine past follies and past crimes to mourn. The virtue, ah! unequal to the vice, Will scarce afford small reason to rejoice. Such, RECOLLECTION! is thy pow'r, high-thron'd In ev'ry breast of mortals, ever own'd. The wretch, who dar'd the vengeance of the skies, At last awakes with horror and surprise. By Thee alarm'd, he sees impending fate, He howls in anguish, and repents too late. But oft thy kindness moves with timely fear The furious rebel in his mad career. Thrice bless'd the man, who in thy sacred shrine Improves the REFUGE from the wrath divine. To the Rev. Mr. Pitkin, on the DEATH of his LADY. WHERE Contemplation finds her sacred Spring; Where heav'nly Music makes the Centre ring; Where Virtue reigns unsulled, and divine; Where Wisdom thron'd, and all the Graces shine; There sits thy Spouse, amid the glitt'ring Throng; There central Beauty feasts the ravish'd Tongue; With recent Powers, with recent glories crown'd, The Choirs angelic shout her Welcome round. The virtuous Dead, demand a grateful Tearâ But cease thy Grief a-while, thy Tears forbear, Not thine alone, the Sorrow I relate, Thy blooming Off-spring feel the mighty Weight; Thus, from the Bosom of the tender Vine, The Branches torn, fall, wither, sink supine. Now flies the Soul, thro' Ãther unconfin'd. Thrice happy State of the immortal Mind! Still in thy Breast tumultuous Passions rise, And urge the lucent Torrent from thine Eyes. Amidst the Seats of Heaven, a Place is free Among those bright angelic Ranks for thee. For thee, they waitâand with expectant Eye, Thy Spouse leans forward from th' ethereal Sky, Thus in my Hearing, âCome away,â she cries, âPartake the sacred Raptures of the Skies! âOur Bliss divine, to Mortals is unknown, âAnd endless Scenes of Happiness our own; âMay the dear Off-spring of our earthly Love, âReceive Admittance to the Joys above! âAttune the Harp to more than mortal Lays, âAnd pay with us, the Tribute of their Praise âTo Him, who died, dread Justice to appease, âWhich reconcil'd, holds Mercy in Embrace; âCreation too, her MAKER'S Death bemoan'd, âRetir'd the Sun, and deep the Centre groan'd. âHe in his Death slew ours, and as he rose, âHe crush'd the Empire of our hated Foes. âHow vain their Hopes to put the GOD to flight, âAnd render Vengeance to the Sons of Light!â Thus having spoke she turn'd away her Eyes, Which beam'd celestial Radiance o'er the Skies. Let Grief no longer damp the sacred Fire, But rise sublime, to equal Bliss aspire; Thy Sighs no more be wafted by the Wind, Complain no more, but be to Heav'n resign'd. 'Twas thine to shew those Treasures all divine, To sooth our Woes, the Task was also thine. Now Sorrow is recumbent on thy Heart, Permit the Muse that healing to impart, Nor can the World, a pitying tear refuse, They weep, and with them, ev'ry heavenly Muse.The above Phillis Wheatley, is a Negro Girl, about 18 Years old, who has been in this Country 11 Years. Phillis Wheatley. Boston, June 16th, 1772. A POEM ON THE DEATH OF CHARLES ELIOT, AGED 12 MONTHS Thro' airy realms, he wings his instant flight, To purer regions of celestial light; Unmov'd he sees unnumber'd systems roll. Beneath his feet, the universal whole In just succession run their destin'd round, And circling wonders spread the dread profound; Th' etherial now, and now the starry skies, With glowing splendors, strike his wond'ring eyes. The heav'nly legions, view, with joy unknown, Press his soft hand, and seat him on the throne, And smiling, thus: âTo this divine abode, âThe seat of Saints, of Angels, and of GOD: âThrice welcome thou.ââThe raptur'd babe replies, âThanks to my God, who snatch'd me to the skies, âEre vice triumphant had possess'd my heart; âEre yet the tempter claim'd my better part; âEre yet on sin's most deadly actions bent; âEre yet I knew temptation's dread intent; âEre yet the rod for horrid crimes I knew, âNot rais'd with vanity, or press'd with wo; âBut soon arriv'd to heav'n's bright port assign'd. âNew glories rush on my expanding mind; âA noble ardor now, my bosom fires, âTo utter what the heav'nly muse inspires!â Joyful he spokeâexulting cherubs round Clap loud their pinions, and the plains resound. Say, parents! why this unavailing moan? Why heave your bosoms with the rising groan? To CHARLES, the happy subject of my song, A happier world, and nobler strains belong. Say, would you tear him from the realms above? [sic] Or make less happy, frantic in your love? Doth his beatitude increase your pain, Or could you welcome to this earth again The son of bliss?âNo, with superior air, Methinks he answers with a smile severe, âThrones and dominions cannot tempt me there!â But still you cry, âO Charles! thy manly mind, âEnwrap our souls, and all thy actions bind; âOur only hope, more dear than vital breath, âTwelve moons revolv'd, and sunk in shades of death! âEngaging infant! Nightly visions give âThee to our arms, and we with joy recieve: âWe fain would clasp the phantom to our breast, âThe phantom flies, and leaves the soul unblest!â Prepare to meet your dearest infant friend Where joys are pure, and glory's without end. Boston, Sept.? 1.?? 1772. Phillis Wheatley. TO THE RIGHT HON.? WILLIAM EARL OF DARTMOUTH, HIS MAJESTY'S SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTH AMERICA &amp;.? &amp;.? &amp;.? Hail! happy day! when Smiling like the Morn, Fair Freedom rose, New England to adorn. The northern clime, beneath her genial ray, Beholds, exulting, thy Paternal Sway, For big with hope, her race no longer mourns, Each Soul expands, each ardent bosom burns, While in thy hand, with pleasure, we behold The Silken reins, and Freedom's charms unfold! Long lost to Realms beneath the northern Skies, She Shines supreme, while hated Faction dies, Soon as he Saw the triumph long desir'd Sick at the view, he languish'd and expir'd. Thus from the Splendors of the rising Sun. The Sickning Owl explores the dark unknown. No more of grievance unredress'd complain; Or injur'd Rights, or groan beneath the chain, Which Wanton Tyranny with lawless hand, Made to enslave, O Liberty! thy Land. My Soul rekindles at thy glorious name Thy beams essential to the vital Flame. The Patrio'ts' breast, what Heav'nly virtue warms! [sic] And adds new lustre to his mental charms; While in thy Speech, the Graces all combine; Apollos too, with Sons of Thunder Join, Then Shall the Race of injur'd Freedom bless The Sire, the Friend, and messenger of Peace. While you, my Lord, read o'er th' advent'rous Song And wonder whence Such daring boldness Sprung: Hence, flow my wishes for the common good By feeling hearts alone, best understood. From Native clime, when Seeming cruel fate Me snatch'd from Afric's fancy'd happy Seat Impetuous.âAh! what bitter pangs molest What Sorrows labour'd in the Parent breast! That more than Stone, ne'er Soft compassion mov'd Who from its Father Seiz'd his much belov'd. Such once my case.âThus I deplore the day When Britons weep beneath Tyrannic sway. To thee, our thanks for favours past are due, To thee, we still Solicite for the new; Since in thy pow'r as in thy Will before, To Sooth the griefs which thou didst then deplore. May heav'nly grace, the Sacred Sanction give To all thy works, and thou for ever live, Not only on the wing of fleeting Fame, (Immortal Honours grace the Patriots' name!) Thee to conduct to Heav'ns refulgent fane; May feiry coursers sweep th' ethereal plain! Thou, like the Prophet, find the bright abode Where dwells thy Sire, the Everlasting God. To the Hon'ble Thomas Hubbard, Esq; On the Death of Mrs. Thankfull Leonard. WHILE thus you mourn beneath the Cypress shade That hand of Death, a kind conductor made To her whose flight commands your tears to flow And wracks your bosom with a scene of wo: Let Recollection bear a tender part To sooth and calm the tortures of your heart: To still the tempest of tumultous grief; To give the heav'nly Nectar of relief; Ah! cease, no more her unknown bliss bemoan! Suspend the sigh, and check the rising groan. Her virtues shone with rays divinely bright, But ah! soon clouded with the shades of night. How free from tow'ring pride, that gentle mind! Which ne'er the hapless indigent declin'd, Expanding free, it sought the means to prove Unfailing Charity, unbounded Love! She unreluctant flies, to see no more Her much lov'd Parents on Earth's dusky shore, 'Till dark mortality shall be withdrawn, And your bless'd eyes salute the op'ning morn. Meaning the Resurrection. Impatient heav'n's resplendent goal to gain She with swift progress scours the azure plain, Where grief subsides, where passion is no more And life's tumultous billows cease to roar, She leaves her earthly mansions for the skies Where new creations feast her won'dring eyes. To heav'n's high mandate chearfully resign'd She mounts, she flies, and leaves the rolling Globe behind. She who late sigh'd for LEONARD to return Has ceas'd to languish, and forgot to mourn. Since to the same divine dominions come She joins her Spouse, and smiles upon the Tomb: And thus addresses;â(let Idea rove)â Lo! this the Kingdom of celestial Love! Could our fond Parents view our endless Joy, Soon would the fountain of their sorrows dry; Then would delightful retrospect inspire, Their kindling bosoms with the sacred fire! Amidst unutter'd pleasures, whilst I play, In the fair sunshine of celestial day: As far as grief affects a deathless Soul, So far doth grief my better mind controul: To see on Earth, my aged Parents mourn, And secret, wish for THANKFULL to return! Let not such thought their latest hours employ But as advancing fast, prepare for equal Joy. Boston, January 2. 1773. Phillis Wheatley. FAREWELL TO AMERICA. To Mrs. S? W?. By Phillis Wheatley. BOSTON, MAY 10, 1773 Saturday last Capt. Calef sailed for London, in [with] whom went Passengers Mr. Nathaniel Wheatley, Merchant; also, Phillis, the extraordinary Negro Poet, Servant to Mr. John Wheatley. ADIEU New England's smiling Meads; Adieu the flow'ry Plain, I leave thy opening Charms, O Spring! To try the Azure Reign. In vain for me the Flow'rets rise And show their gawdy Pride, While here beneath the Northern Skies I mourn for Health deny'd. Thee, charming Maid! while I pursue In thy luxuriant Reign; And sigh and languish, thee to view, Thy Pleasures to regain. Susanna mourns, nor can I bear To see the Christal Show'r Fast fallingâthe indulgent Tear In sad Departure's Hour. Not unregarding lo! I see Thy Soul with Grief oppress'd; Ah! curb the rising Groan for me, Nor Sighs disturb thy Breast. In vain the feather'd Songsters sing, In vain the Garden Blooms, And on the Bosom of the Spring, Breaths out her sweet Perfumes. While for Britannia's distant Shore, We sweep the liquid Plain, Till Aura to the Arms restore Of this belov'd Domain. Lo! Health appears! Celestial Dame, Complacent and serene, With Hebe's Mantle o'er her Frame, With Soul-delighting Mein. Deep in a Vale where London lies, With misty Vapours crown'd, Which cloud Aurora's thousand Dyes, And Veil her Charms around. Why PhÅbus! moves thy Car so slow, So slow thy rising Ray; Nor gives the mantled Town to View Thee glorious King of Day! But late from Orient Skies, behold! He Shines benignly bright, He decks his native Plains with Gold, With chearing Rays of Light. For thee Britannia! I resign New-England's smiling Face, To view again her Charms divine, One short reluctant Space. But thou Temptation! hence, away, With all thy hated Train Of Illsânor tempt my Mind astray From Virtue's sacred Strain. Most happy! who with Sword and Shield Is screen'd from dire Alarms, And fell Temptation, on the Field, Of fatal Power disarms. But cease thy Lays, my Lute forbear Nor frown my gentle Muse, To see the secret falling Tear, Nor pitying look refuse. An ELEGY, To Miss. Mary Moorhead, on the DEATH of her Father, The Rev. Mr. JOHN MOORHEAD. INVOLV'D in Clouds of Wo, Maria mourns, And various Anguish wracks her Soul by turns; See thy lov'd Parent languishing in Death, His Exit watch, and catch his flying Breath; âStay happy Shade,â distress'd Maria cries; âStay happy Shade,â the hapless Church replies; âSuspend a while, suspend thy rapid flight, âStill with thy Friendship, chear our sullen Night; âThe sullen Night of Error, Sin, and Pain; âSee Earth astonish'd at the Loss, complain;â Thine, and the Church's Sorrows I deplore; Moorhead is dead, and Friendship is no more; From Earth she flies, nor mingles with our Wo, Since cold the Breast, where once she deign'd to glow; Here shone the heavenly Virtue, there confess'd, Celestial Love, reign'd joyous in his Breast; Till Death grown jealous for his drear Domain, Sent his dread Offspring, unrelenting Pain. With hasty Wing, the Son of Terror flies, Lest Moorhead find the Portal of the Skies; Without a Passage through the Shades below, Like great Elijah, Death's triumphant Foe; Death follows soon, nor leaves the Prophet long, His Eyes are seal'd, and every Nerve unstrung; Forever silent is the stiff'ning Clay, While the rapt Soul, explores the Realms of Day. Oft has he strove to raise the Soul from Earth, Oft has he travail'd in the heavenly Birth; Till JESUS took possession of the Soul, Till the new Creature liv'd throughout the whole. When fierce conviction seiz'd the Sinner's Mind, The Law-loud thundering he to Death consign'd; JEHOVAH'S Wrath revolving, he surveys, The Fancy's terror, and the Soul's amaze. Say, what is Death? The Gloom of endless Night, Which from the Sinner, bars the Gates of Light: Say, what is Hell? In Horrors passing strange; His Vengeance views, who seals his final Change; The winged Hours, the final Judgment brings, Decides his Fate, and that of Gods and Kings; Tremendous Doom! And dreadful to be told, To dwell in Tophet 'stead of shrines of Gold. âGods! Ye shall die like Men,â the Herald cries, âAnd stil'd no more the Children of the Skies.â Trembling he sees the horrid Gulf appear, Creation quakes, and no Deliverer near; With Heart relenting to his Feelings kind, See Moorhead hasten to relieve his Mind. See him the Gospel's healing Balm impart, To sooth the Anguish of his tortur'd Heart. He points the trembling Mountain, and the Tree, Which bent beneath th' incarnate Deity, How God descended, wonderous to relate, To bear our Crimes, a dread enormous Weight; Seraphic Strains too feeble to repeat, Half the dread Punishment the GOD-HEAD meet. Suspended there, (till Heaven was reconcil'd,) Like MOSES' Serpent in the Desert wild. The Mind appeas'd what new Devotion glows, With Joy unknown, the raptur'd Soul o'erflows; While on his GOD-like Savior's Glory bent, His Life proves witness of his Heart's intent. Lament ye indigent the Friendly Mind, Which oft relented, to your Mis'ry kind. With humble Gratitude he render'd Praise, To Him whose Spirit had inspir'd his Lays; To Him whose Guidance gave his Words to flow, Divine instruction, and the Balm of Wo: To you his Offspring, and his Church, be given, A triple Portion of his Thirst for Heaven; Such was the Prophet; we the Stroke deplore, Which let's us hear his warning Voice no more. But cease complaining, hush each murm'ring Tongue, Pursue the Example which inspires my Song. Let his Example in your Conduct shine; Own the afflicting Providence, divine; So shall bright Periods grace your joyful Days, And heavenly Anthems swell your Songs of Praise. Printed from the Original Manuscript, and Sold by WILLIAM M'ALPINE, at his Shop in Marlborough-Street, 1773. Boston, Decem. 15 1773. Phillis Wheatley. [TO A GENTLEMAN OF THE NAVY.] For the ROYAL AMERICAN MAGAZINE. By particular request we insert the following Poem addressed, by Philis (a young Affrican, of surprising genius) to a gentleman of the navy, with his reply. By this single instance may be seen, the importance of education.âUncultivated nature is much the same in every part of the globe. It is probable Europe and Affrica would be alike savage or polite in the same circumstances; though, it may be questioned, whether men who have no artificial wants, are capable of becoming so ferocious as those, who by faring sumptuously every day, are reduced to a habit of thinking it necessary to their happiness, to plunder the whole human race. Celestial muse! for sweetness fam'd inspire My wondrous theme with true poetic fire, Rochfort, for thee! And Greaves deserve my lays The sacred tribute of ingenuous praise. For here, true merit shuns the glare of light, She loves oblivion, and evades the sight. At sight of her, see dawning genius rise And stretch her pinions to her native skies. Paris, for Helen's bright resistless charms, Made Illion bleed and set the world in arms. Had you appear'd on the Achaian shore Troy now had stood, and Helen charm'd no more. The Phrygian hero had resign'd the dame For purer joys in friendship's sacred flame, The noblest gift, and of immortal kind, That brightens, dignifies the manly mind. Calliope, half gracious to my prayer, Grants but the half and scatters half in air. Far in the space where ancient Albion keeps Amidst the roarings of the sacred deeps, Where willing forests leave their native plain, Descend, and instant, plough the wat'ry main. Strange to relate! with canvas wings they speed To distant worlds; of distant worlds the dread. The trembling natives of the peaceful plain, Astonish'd view the heroes of the main, Wond'ring to see two chiefs of matchless grace, Of generous bosom, and ingenuous face, From ocean sprung, like ocean foes to rest, The thirst of glory burns each youthful breast. In virtue's cause, the muse implores for grace, These blooming sons of Neptune's royal race; Cerulean youths! your joint assent declare, Virtue to rev'rence, more than mortal fair, A crown of glory, which the muse will twine, Immortal trophy! Rochfort shall be thine! Thine too O Greaves! for virtue's offspring share, Celestial friendship and the muse's care. Yours is the song, and your's the honest praise, Lo! Rochfort smiles, and Greaves approves my lays. BOSTON; October 30th. 1774. THE ANSWER. Celestial muse! sublimest of the nine, Assist my song, and dictate every line: Inspire me once, nor with imperfect lays, To sing this great, this lovely virgins praise: But yet, alas! what tribute can I bring, WH?TL?Y but smiles, whilst I thus faintly sing, Behold with reverence, and with joy adore; The lovely daughter of the Affric shore, Where every grace, and every virtue join, That kindles friendship and makes love divine; In hue as diff'rent as in souls above; The rest of mortals who in vain have strove, Th' immortal wreathe, the muse's gift to share, Which heav'n reserv'd for this angelic fair. Blest be the guilded shore, the happy land, Where spring and autumn gently hand in hand; O'er shady forests that scarce know a bound, In vivid blaze alternately dance round: Where cancers torrid heat the soul inspires; With strains divine and true poetic fires; (Far from the reach of Hudson's chilly bay) Where cheerful phÅbus makes all nature gay; Where sweet refreshing breezes gently fan; The flow'ry path, the ever verdent lawn, The artless grottos, and the soft retreats; âAt once the lover and thee muse's seats.â Where nature taught, (tho' strange it is to tell,) Her flowing pencil Europe to excell. Britania's glory long hath fill'd the skies; Whilst other nations, tho' with envious eyes, Have view'd her growing greatness, and the rules, That's long been taught in her untainted schools: Where great Sir Isaac! whose immortal name; Still shines the brightest on the seat of fame; By ways and methods never known before; The sacred depth of nature did explore: And like a God, on philosophic wings; Rode with the planets thro' their circling rings: Surveying nature with a curious eye, And viewing other systems in the sky. Where nature's bard with true poetic lays, The pristine state of paradise displays, And with a genius that's but very rare Describes the first the only happy pair That in terrestial mansions ever reign'd, View'd hapiness now lost, and now regain'd, Unravel'd all the battles of the Gods, And view'd old night below the antipodes. On his imperious throne, with awful sway, Commanding regions yet unknown today, Or where those lofty bards have dwelt so long, That ravish'd Europe with their heavenly song, But now this blissful clime, this happy land, That all the neighbouring nations did command; Whose royal navy neptunes waves did sweep, Reign'd Prince alone, and sov'reign of the deep: No more can boast, but of the power to kill, By force of arms, or diabolic skill. For softer strains we quickly must repair To Wheatly's song, for Wheatly is the fair; That has the art, which art could ne'er acquire: To dress each sentence with seraphic fire. Her wondrous virtues I could ne'er express! To paint her charms, would only make them less. December 2nd. 1774. PHILIS'S Reply to the Answer in our last by the Gentleman in the Navy. For one bright moment, heavenly goddess! shine, Inspire my song and form the lays divine. Rochford, attend. Beloved of PhÅbus! hear, A truer sentence never reach'd thine ear; Struck with thy song, each vain conceit resign'd A soft affection seiz'd my grateful mind, While I each golden sentiment admire In thee, the muse's bright celestial fire. The generous plaudit 'tis not mine to claim, A muse untutor'd, and unknown to fame. The heavenly sisters pour thy notes along And crown their bard with every grace of song. My pen, least favour'd by the tuneful nine, Can never rival, never equal thine; Then fix the humble Afric muse's seat At British Homer's and Sir Isaac's feet. Those bards whose fame in deathless strains arise Creation's boast, and fav'rites of the skies. In fair description are thy powers display'd In artless grottos, and the sylvan shade; Charm'd with thy painting, how my bosom burns! And pleasing Gambia on my soul returns, With native grace in spring's luxuriant reign, Smiles the gay mead, and Eden blooms again, The various bower, the tuneful flowing stream, The soft retreats, the lovers golden dream, Her soil spontaneous, yields exhaustless stores; For phÅbus revels on her verdant shores. Whose flowery births, a fragrant train appear, And crown the youth throughout the smiling year, There, as in Britain's favour'd isle, behold The bending harvest ripen into gold! Just are thy views of Afric's blissful plain, On the warm limits of the land and main. Pleas'd with the theme, see sportive fancy play, In realms devoted to the God of day! Europa's bard, who the great depth explor'd, Of nature, and thro' boundless systems soar'd, Thro' earth, thro' heaven, and hell's profound domain, Where night eternal holds her awful reign. But, lo! in him Britania's prophet dies, And whence, ah! whence, shall other Newton's rise? Muse, bid thy Rochford's matchless pen display The charms of friendship in the sprightly lay. Queen of his song, thro' all his numbers shine, And plausive glories, goddess! shall be thine. With partial grace thou mak'st his verse excel, And his the glory to describe so well. Cerulean bard! to thee these strains belong, The Muse's darling and the prince of song. DECEMBER 5th, 1774. TO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON. The following LETTER and VERSES, were written by the famous Phillis Wheatley, the African Poetess, and presented to his Excellency Gen. Washington. SIR, I Have taken the freedom to address your Excellency in the enclosed poem, and entreat your acceptance, though I am not insensible of its inaccuracies. Your being appointed by the Grand Continental Congress to be Generalissimo of the armies of North America, together with the fame of your virtues, excite sensations not easy to suppress. Your generosity, therefore, I presume, will pardon the attempt. Wishing your Excellency all possible success in the great cause you are so generously engaged in. I am, Your Excellency's most obedient humble servant, PHILLIS WHEATLEY. Providence, Oct. 26, 1775. His Excellency Gen. Washington. CElestial choir! enthron'd in realms of light, Columbia's scenes of glorious toils I write. While freedom's cause her anxious breast alarms, She flashes dreadful in refulgent arms. See mother earth her offspring's fate bemoan, And nations gaze at scenes before unknown! See the bright beams of heaven's revolving light Involved in sorrows and the veil of night! The goddess comes, she moves divinely fair, Olive and laurel binds her golden hair: Wherever shines this native of the skies, Unnumber'd charms and recent graces rise. Muse! bow propitious while my pen relates How pour her armies through a thousand gates: As when Eolus heaven's fair face deforms, Enwrapp'd in tempest and a night of storms; Astonish'd ocean feels the wild uproar, The refluent surges beat the sounding shore; Or thick as leaves in Autumn's golden reign, Such, and so many, moves the warrior's train. In bright array they seek the work of war, Where high unfurl'd the ensign waves in air. Shall I to Washington their praise recite? Enough thou know'st them in the fields of fight. Thee, first in place and honours,âwe demand The grace and glory of thy martial band. Fam'd for thy valour, for thy virtues more, Hear every tongue thy guardian aid implore! One century scarce perform'd its destin'd round, When Gallic powers Columbia's fury found; And so may you, whoever dares disgrace The land of freedom's heaven-defended race! Fix'd are the eyes of nations on the scales, For in their hopes Columbia's arm prevails. Anon Britannia droops the pensive head, While round increase the rising hills of dead. Ah! cruel blindness to Columbia's state! Lament thy thirst of boundless power too late. Proceed, great chief, with virtue on thy side, Thy ev'ry action let the goddess guide. A crown, a mansion, and a throne that shine, With gold unfading, WASHINGTON! be thine. ON THE CAPTURE OF GENERAL LEE The following thoughts on his Excellency Major General Lee being betray'd into the hands of the Enemy by the treachery of a pretended Friend; To the Honourable James Bowdoin Esq.? are most respectfully Inscrib'd, By his most obedient and devoted humble Servant. PHILLIS WHEATLEY. The deed perfidious, and the Hero's fate, In tender strains, celestial Muse! relate. The latent foe to friendship makes pretence The name assumes without the sacred sense! He, with a rapture well dissembl'd, press'd The hero's hand, and fraudful, thus address'd. âO friend belov'd! may heaven its aid afford, âAnd spread yon troops beneath thy conquering sword! âGrant to America's united prayer âA glorious conquest on the field of war. âBut thou indulgent to my warm request âVouchsafe thy presence as my honour'd guest: âFrom martial cares a space unbend thy soul âIn social banquet, and the sprightly bowl.â Thus spoke the foe; and warlike Lee reply'd, âIll fits it me, who such an army guide; âTo whom his conduct each brave soldier owes âTo waste an hour in banquets or repose: âThis day important, with loud voice demands âOur wisest Counsels, and our bravest hands.â Thus having said he heav'd a boding sigh. The hour approach'd that damps Columbia's Joy. Inform'd, conducted, by the treach'rous friend With winged speed the adverse train attend Ascend the Dome, and seize with frantic air The self surrender'd glorious prize of war! On sixty coursers, swifter than the wind They fly, and reach the British camp assign'd. Arriv'd, what transport touch'd their leader's breast! Who thus deriding, the brave Chief address'd. âSay, art thou he, beneath whose vengeful hands âOur best of heroes grasp'd in death the sands? âOne fierce regard of thine indignant eye âTurn'd Brittain pale, and made her armies fly; âBut Oh! how chang'd! a prisoner in our arms âTill martial honour, dreadful in her charms, âShall grace Britannia at her sons' return, âAnd widow'd thousands in our triumphs mourn.â While thus he spoke, the hero of renown Survey'd the boaster with a gloomy frown And stern reply'd. âOh arrogrance of tongue! âAnd wild ambition, ever prone to wrong! âBeliev'st thou Chief, that armies such as thine âCan stretch in dust that heaven-defended line? âIn vain allies may swarm from distant lands âAnd demons aid in formidable bands. âGreat as thou art, thou shun'st the field of fame âDisgrace to Brittain, and the British name! âWhen offer'd combat by the noble foe, â(Foe to mis-rule,) why did thy sword forgo âThe easy conquest of the rebel-land? âPerhaps too easy for thy martial hand. âWhat various causes to the field invite! âFor plunder you, and we for freedom fight: âHer cause divine with generous ardor fires, âAnd every bosom glows as she inspires! âAlready, thousands of your troops are fled âTo the drear mansions of the silent dead: âColumbia too, beholds with streaming eyes âHer heroes fallâ'tis freedom's sacrifice! âSo wills the Power who with convulsive storms âShakes impious realms, and nature's face deforms. âYet those brave troops innum'rous as the sands âOne soul inspires, one General Chief commands âFind in your train of boasted heroes, one âTo match the praise of Godlike Washington. âThrice happy Chief! in whom the virtues join, âAnd heaven-taught prudence speaks the man divine!â He ceas'd. Amazement struck the warrior-train, And doubt of conquest, on the hostile plain. BOSTON. Dec.? 30, 1776 ON THE DEATH OF GENERAL WOOSTER Madam I rec?, your favour by Mr Dennison inclosing a paper containing the Character of the truely worthy General Wooster. It was with the most sensible regret that I heard of his fall in battle, but the pain of so afflicting a dispensation of Providence must be greatly alleviated to you and all his friends in the consideration that he fell a martyr in the Cause of Freedomâ From this the muse rich consolation draws He nobly perish'd in his Country's cause His Country's Cause that ever fir'd his mind Where martial flames, and Christian virtues join'd. How shall my pen his warlike deeds proclaim Or paint them fairer on the list of Fameâ Enough great Cheifânow wrapt in shades around Thy grateful Country shall thy praise resound Tho' not with mortals' empty praise elate That vainest vapour to th' immortal State Inly serene the expiring hero lies And thus (while heav'nward roll his swimming eyes) Permit, great power while yet my fleeting breath And Spirits wander to the verge of Deathâ Permit me yet to paint fair freedom's charms For her the Continent shines bright in arms By thy high will, celestial prize she cameâ For her we combat on the feild of fame Without her presence vice maintains full sway And social love and virtue wing their way O still propitious be thy guardian care And lead Columbia thro' the toils of war. With thine own hand conduct them and defend And bring the dreadful contest to an endâ For ever grateful let them live to thee And keep them ever virtuous, brave, and freeâ But how, presumptuous shall we hope to find Divine acceptance with th' Almighty mindâ While yet (O deed ungenerous!) they disgrace And hold in bondage Afric's blameless race? Let virtue reignâAnd thou accord our prayers Be victory our's, and generous freedom theirs. The hero pray'dâthe wond'ring Spirit fled And Sought the unknown regions of the deadâ Tis thine fair partner of his life, to find His virtuous path and follow close behindâ A little moment steals him from thy Sight He waits thy coming to the realms of light Freed from his labours in the ethereal Skies Where in Succession endless pleasures rise! You will do me a great favour by returning to me by the first oppy those books that remain unsold and remitting the money for those that are soldâI can easily dispose of them here for 12/Lm.? eachâI am greatly obliged to you for the care you show me, and your condescention in taking so much pains for my InterestâI am extremely Sorry not to have been honour'd with a personal acquaintance with youâif the foregoing lines meet with your acceptance and approbation I shall think them highly honour'd. I hope you will pardon the length of my letter, when the reason is apparentâfondness of the Subject &amp;âthe highest respect for the deceas'dâI sincerely sympathize with you in the great loss you and your family Sustain and am Sincerely Your friend &amp; very humble Servt Phillis Wheatley Queenstreet Boston Julyâ15th 1778 AN ELEGY, SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF THAT GREAT DIVINE, THE REVEREND AND LEARNED DR. SAMUEL COOPER, Who departed this Life December 29, 1783, ÃTATIS 59. BY PHILLIS PETERS. BOSTON: Printed and Sold by E. Russell, in Essex-Street, near Liberty-Pole, M,DCC,LXXXIV. To the CHURCH and CONGREGATION assembling in Brattle-Street, the following, ELEGY, Sacred to the MEMORY of their late Reverend and Worthy PASTOR, Dr. SAMUEL COOPER, is, with the greatest Sympathy, most respectfully inscribed by their Obedient, Humble Servant, PHILLIS PETERS. BOSTON, Jan. 1784. O THOU whose exit wraps in boundless woe, For Thee the tears of various Nations flow: For Thee the floods of virtuous sorrows rise From the full heart and burst from streaming eyes, Far from our view to Heaven's eternal height, The Seat of bliss divine, and glory bright; Far from the restless turbulence of life, The war of factions, and impassion'd strife. From every ill mortality endur'd, Safe in celestial Salem's walls secur'd. E'ER yet from this terrestrial state retir'd, The Virtuous lov'd Thee, and the Wise admir'd. The gay approv'd Thee, and the grave rever'd; And all thy words with rapt attention heard! The Sons of Learning on thy lessons hung, While soft persuasion mov'd th' illit'rate throng. Who, drawn by rhetoric's commanding laws, Comply'd obedient, nor conceiv'd the cause. Thy every sentence was with grace inspir'd, And every period with devotion fir'd; Bright Truth thy guide without a dark disguise, And penetration's all-discerning eyes. THY COUNTRY mourn's th' afflicting Hand divine That now forbids thy radiant lamp to shine, Which, like the sun, resplendent source of light Diffus'd its beams, and chear'd our gloom of night. WHAT deep-felt sorrow in each Kindred breast With keen sensation rends the heart distress'd! Fraternal love sustains a tenderer part, And mourns a BROTHER with a BROTHER'S heart. THY CHURCH laments her faithful PASTOR fled To the cold mansions of the silent dead. There hush'd forever, cease the heavenly strain, That wak'd the soul, but here resounds in vain. Still live thy merits, where thy name is known, As the sweet Rose, its blooming beauty gone Retains its fragrance with a long perfume: Thus COOPER! thus thy death-less name shall bloom Unfading, in thy Church and Country's love, While Winter frowns, or spring renews the grove. The hapless Muse, her loss in COOPER mourns, And as she sits, she writes, and weeps, by turns; A Friend sincere, whose mild indulgent grace Encourag'd oft, and oft approv'd her lays. WITH all their charms, terrestrial objects strove, But vain their pleasures to attract his love. Such COOPER wasâat Heaven's high call he flies; His task well finish'd, to his native skies. Yet to his fate reluctant we resign, Tho' our's to copy conduct such as thine: Such was thy wish, th' observant Muse survey'd Thy latest breath, and this advice convey'd. LIBERTY AND PEACE, A POEM. By PHILLIS PETERS. BOSTON: Printed by WARDEN and RUSSELL, At Their Office in Marlborough-Street. M,DCC,LXXXIV. LO! Freedom Comes. Th' prescient Muse foretold, All Eyes th' accomplish'd Prophecy behold: Her Port describ'd, âShe moves divinely fair, âOlive and Laurel bind her golden Hair.â She, the bright Progeny of Heaven, descends, And every Grace her sovereign Step attends; For now kind Heaven, indulgent to our Prayer, In smiling Peace resolves the Din of War. Fix'd in Columbia her illustrious Line, And bids in thee her future Councils shine. To every Realm her Portals open'd wide, Receives from each the full commercial Tide. Each Art and Science now with rising Charms Th' expanding Heart with Emulation warms. E'en great Britannia sees with dread Surprize, And from the dazzl'ing Splendors turns her Eyes! Britain, whose Navies swept th' Atlantic o'er, And Thunder sent to every distant Shore: E'en thou, in Manners cruel as thou art, The Sword resign'd, resume the friendly Part! For Galia's Power espous'd Columbia's Cause, And new-born Rome shall give Britannia Law, Nor unremember'd in the grateful Strain, Shall princely Louis' friendly Deeds remain; The generous Prince th' impending Vengeance eye's, Sees the fierce Wrong, and to the rescue flies. Perish that Thirst of boundless Power, that drew On Albion's Head the Curse to Tyrants due. But thou appeas'd submit to Heaven's decree, That bids this Realm of Freedom rival thee! Now sheathe the Sword that bade the Brave attone With guiltless Blood for Madness not their own. Sent from th' Enjoyment of their native Shore Ill-fatedânever to behold her more! From every Kingdom on Europa's Coast Throng'd various Troops, their Glory, Strength and Boast. With heart-felt pity fair Hibernia saw Columbia menac'd by the Tyrant's Law: On hostile Fields fraternal Arms engage, And mutual Deaths, all dealt with mutual Rage; The Muse's Ear hears mother Earth deplore Her ample Surface smoak with kindred Gore: The hostile Field destroys the social Ties, And ever-lasting Slumber seals their Eyes. Columbia mourns, the haughty Foes deride, Her Treasures plunder'd, and her Towns destroy'd: Witness how Charlestown's curling Smoaks arise, In sable Columns to the clouded Skies! The ample Dome, high-wrought with curious Toil, In one sad Hour the savage Troops despoil. Descending Peace the Power of War confounds; From every Tongue celestial Peace resounds: As from the East th' illustrious King of Day, With rising Radiance drives the Shades away, So Freedom comes array'd with Charms divine, And in her Train Commerce and Plenty shine. Britannia owns her Independent Reign, Hibernia, Scotia, and the Realms of Spain; And great Germania's ample Coast admires The generous Spirit that Columbia fires. Auspicious Heaven shall fill with fav'ring Gales, Where e'er Columbia spreads her swelling Sails: To every Realm shall Peace her Charms display, And Heavenly Freedom spread her golden Ray. An ELEGY on leaving ?. FAREWEL! ye friendly bowÃ©rs, ye streams adieu, I leave with sorrow each sequesterÃ©d, seat: The lawns, where oft I swept the morning dew, The groves, from noon-tide rays a kind retreat. Yon wood-crownÃ©d hill, whose far projecting shade, Inverted trembles in the limpid lake: Where wrapt in thought I pensively have strayÃ©d, For crowds and noise, reluctant, I forsake. The solemn pines, that, winding through the vale. In graceful rows attract the wandÃ©ring eye, Where the soft ring-dove pours her soothing tale, No more must veil me from the fervid sky. Beneath yon aged oak's protecting arms, Oft-times beside the pebblÃ©d brook I lay; Where, pleasÃ©d with simple Nature's various charms, I passÃ©d in grateful solitude the day. Rapt with the melody of Cynthio's strain, There first my bosom felt poetic flame; Mute was the bleating language of the plain, And with his lays the wanton fawns grew tame. But, ah! those pleasing hours are ever flown; Ye scenes of transport from my thoughts retire; Those rural joys no more the day shall crown, No more my hand shall wake the warbling lyre. But come, sweet Hope, from thy divine retreat, Come to my breast, and chase my cares away, Bring calm Content to gild my gloomy seat, And cheer my bosom with her heavÃ©nly ray. To Mr. and Mrs. ?, on the Death of their Infant Son, By Phillis Wheatly O DEATH! whose sceptre, trembling realms obey, And weeping millions mourn thy savage sway; Say, shall we call thee by the name of friend, Who blasts our joys, and bids our glories end? Behold, a child who rivals op'ning morn, When its first beams the eastern hills adorn; So sweetly blooming once that lovely boy, His father's hope, his mother's only joy, Nor charms nor innocence prevail to save, From the grim monarch of the gloomy grave! Two moons revolve when lo! among the dead The beauteous infant lays his weary head: For long he strove the tyrant to withstand, And the dread terrors of his iron hand; Vain was his strife, with the relentless power, His efforts weak; and this his mortal hour; He sinksâhe diesâcelestial muse, relate, His spirit's entrance at the sacred gate. Methinks I hear the heav'nly courts resound, The recent theme inspires the choirs around. His guardian angel with delight unknown, Hails his bless'd charge on his immortal throne; His heart expands at scenes unknown before, Dominions praise, and prostrate thrones adore; Before the Eternal's feet their crowns are laid, The glowing seraph vails his sacred head. Spirits redeem'd, that more than angels shine, For nobler praises tune their harps divine: These saw his entrance; his soft hand they press'd, Sat on his throne, and smiling thus address'd, âHail: thou! thrice welcome to this happy shore, Born to new life where changes are no more; Glad heaven receives thee, and thy God bestows, Immortal youth exempt from pain and woes. Sorrow and sin, those foes to human rest, Forever banish'd from thy happy breast.â Gazing they spoke, and raptur'd thus replies, The beauteous stranger in the etherial skies. âThus safe conducted to your bless'd abodes, With sweet surprize I mix among the Gods; The vast profound of this amazing grace, Beyond your search, immortal powers, I praise; Great Sire, I sing thy boundless love divine, Mine is the bliss, but all the glory thine.â All heav'n rejoices as your . . . . . . . sings, To heavenly airs he tunes the sounding strings; Mean time on earth the hapless parents mourn, âToo quickly fled, ah! never to return.â Thee, the vain visions of the night restore, Illusive fancy paints the phantom o'er; Fain would we clasp him, but he wings his flight; Deceives our arms, and mixes with the night; But oh! suppress the clouds of grief that roll, Invading peace, and dark'ning all the soul. Should heaven restore him to your arms again, Oppress'd with woes, a painful endless train, How would your prayers, your ardent wishes, rise, Safe to repose him in his native skies.</field>
