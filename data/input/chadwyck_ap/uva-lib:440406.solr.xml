      <field name="fulltext">THIS BOOK IS DEDICATED TO MY WIFE, ELIZABETH</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WAR-BONNET SECTION THE MOUNTAINS WITH STORMS FOR WAR-BONNETS The mountains with storms for war-bonnets, The mountains with earthquakes for ponies, Ride on through the hundreds of millions of years, Talking and laughing through rain, wind and tears; Volcanoes their brothers, their chieftains, and cronies. We, too, are their brothers and cronies. They bathe in the oceans then lift up their heads. They leap from the deep, from the old coral beds. And conquer the shores again, moving by ages, While seemingly still as old books with closed pages. Beware of the mountains, Oh Babylon men! The mountains await you, outstay, ride you down. They charge by like lightning in the sight of slow heaven, And will conquer the earth ere the sun tumbles down.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RISING WOLF SECTION RISING WOLF Rising Wolf, Rising Wolf, Rising Wolf, the brave beast, Looms up past the ranges And leaps through the roof Of the star-sky at twilight And puts to the proof All the ten dogs in my wolf-hunting heart, Snarling, defying them there all day long, And giving the cry that the wolves call a song. And my dogs bark in circles, but keep well aloof From the proud Rising Wolf, Rising Wolf, Rising Wolf. Rising Wolf, Rising Wolf, Rising Wolf, the brave beast, It will take a hundred brave dogs at the least To hunt down and beat Rising Wolf, the brave beast. There are ten great dogs in my heart and no more To hunt and to hound Rising Wolf, the brave beast. But when will I have the strength of ten men, And have one hundred brave dogs at the least? In my heart are ten hounds As small as small flowers, When I turn them loose they are great as the hours: They fill the valleys, they fill the rivers; They leap to the stars, they leap to the sun; They stand in a circle and bark at the snarling one. And they think it is strange and very surprising They cannot conquer the wolf in his rising. They bark, but their bark is uncertain surmising; And they beat back and whine, consulting, advising, Back there on the prairie amazed at his rising, And wonder what has delayed their great feast On black Rising Wolf, Rising Wolf, the brave beast. Where are nine strong men to go with me now That the hundred strong dogs in our hearts may rush down From the clouds and the sun and the stars on the crown Of black Rising Wolf, Rising Wolf, the brave beast, And beat the beast down, Till we chain him, enslave him, and make him our own, This river and snowstorm and stone, This mountain unconquered, whose hair, bone, and blood, Are those of the deeps in their primeval flood, Are those of the winds to the west of the sky, Are those of the highest Red Warriors on high? THE HUNTING DOGS The ten hunting dogs in my heart Have captured forty-six years In a wood that is dewy with tears. The ten hunting dogs in my heart Have captured, as hunting dogs should, That is, without wounding at all, All the wild birds that call In my rustic cage in my house in the wood. The ten hunting dogs in my heart Have helped tame the chipmunks and small baby bears, They drive mountain lions back, back, to their lairs. They help me to feed on elk meat, And my heart must beat to their rustling feet. And these are their names: America, Beauty, Song, Religion, Love of Lone Games, The Indian, the Lover, the Brother, the Proud One, The Chief No Man Tames. CONCERNING HIS INSIGNIA To Stephen Graham Brother, who went a-climbing across Asia, Tramping with big boots through the mysterious places, The wide world is your parish, And new pathways Beckon you farther through still further races. We will be meeting soon on many boundaries: We crossed the Canadian Border for a sign. We will cross and claim a thousand oceans, And each side will be yours and each side mine. Restless of heart! Always overshining Every path you found, the Cross gave light. There in that light you found your hope and wisdom, Tramping on, still fevered, through the night. You will tell world's-end of the other world's-end; You will tell borders where far borders are; You will yet reconcile such separate racesâ You will look down, a conqueror, from your star. WORLD-MAPS To Stephen Graham I would draw rich maps of the whole world And every classic nation of the pastâ The spread of each religion, age by age, The plot of each soul-empire and the cast: The states that rose and fell after Christ's death, The nations that turned flowers in Buddha's breath, The states Prophet Mohammed made too brave, The states Osiris wakened from the grave. THE HOUSE OF BOONE The smoke from the house Of Daniel Boone, More than a century ago, Turned to a Kansas sunflower In the sky, Then to a vision Of the Colorado mountains, Then to the Northwestern mountains, Row on rowâ Then to the California mountains, With their cloudy snow. THE RANGER'S CABIN The Ranger's cabin keeps its light all night, Just as the lighthouse on the terrible shore. If you are lost, upon the high passes, Fight toward the light, then wander never more. THE SNOW BY RISING WOLF PEAK By Rising Wolf Peak There's a canyon of snow, Heart-shaped, Fair, and white. It turns to blood-red If you climb there And stare, Through The long night. THE CHILD-HEART IN THE MOUNTAINS On Rising Wolf Peak Is a canyon of snow Heart-shaped and Strange and wild. The pilgrim Who climbs To the canyon of snow Returns With the heart of a child. THE BRIDE'S BOUQUETS By Rising Wolf We saw the bride's bouquets Tied to the New Moon. BONNETS By Rising Wolf Bonnets for Country girls Are found in Flowery swirls. THE LADY-SLIPPERS By Rising Wolf The lady-slippers Grow on a green ladder In a pretty row. THE PENNANT Where the forest-fires had blackened Old Rising Wolf with shame After The first healing storm The pennant Of the green-grass soldiers Came. âCÅUR D'ALENEâ There blooms In the Lodge-Pole forest lane The flower called âThe pointed heartâ Or, sometimes âCÅur d' Alene.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HERE BEGINS THE FOREST-RANGER'S COURTSHIP WHICH IS AN INTERLUDE THROUGH THE BOOK TILL âTHE FOREST-RANGER'S HONEYMOONâ BEGINS. THE HALL OF JUDGMENT The Forest-Ranger's Courtship To this vague court of judgment we appeal To this tremendous wind-swept range we callâ Be with us through the fall; Though we are far away, and this majestic hall Seems alien to the eastern falling leaves, October apples and October sheaves. We have the dream of conquering all the maps, Of taking our twelve sons around the world: We will not be stopped by rain or snow, Or caught in little traps. We would be unchained from dusty houses; We would enjoy, then leave the largest towns. We would enjoy and love the oldest neighbors, Worn only here in the flowers' hall of justice, Worn only in this great court of appeals, Here would our tribe judge and be judged forever, Here we would be sealed with sacred seals, Till none can move us, or distress Except the wilderness; Till none can comfort, harry, or caress Except the wilderness; Till thus, by being free And filled with the waterfall's mirth, Our house, our twelve bright sons, And our own souls Explore and conquer the wilderness of earth, All trails of the earth. THE PIGEON DRAGON-ROSE The rose that bloomed In the waterfall Turned to a Pigeon Dragon-Rose More sturdy of frame, More icy of thorn Than any garden-blossom That blows. THE TWIN WATERFALLS The Twin Waterfalls That were jealous Over a huckleberry bush Swept down the mountains With a quarrel and a push. THE CURLING WAVES The curling waves Of Iceberg Lake Wind and wind Before they break. THE MOUNTAINS ARE THE MEMBERS OF OUR FAMILY The mountains are the members of our family to defend us. They fight us by the campfire but are for us in the street. They gather round the fire log, insulting and accusing. They curse the cat, they kick the dog, Step on each other's feet, Full of open feuds, with us, and one another; But when it comes to war with men Each mountain is our brother. In Babylon we speak of them, Each mountain is our brother. THE BABBITT JAMBOREE When I see an Indian dressed for war Yet dancing for a Babbitt jamboree In plumes no Babbitt ever dares to wear, An anger rises in me Like high tide in the sea. These are my own, these Indians. I know What makes the breeds more bitter than the bloods. There's just one drop of Indian blood in me, Yet in tremendous tides and floods It seems to sweep upon me when I watch Those who have owned this land turned to a show. And when I put a feather in my hat, It is with thoughts the Babbitts cannot know. Woe to the pale face then who thinks it is for show! That little feather stands for a whole war. It means I beat the tom-toms in the rain; It means a scalping knife is in my belt, That I will lead the young braves not in vain. It means when all these silly days are done, Sons of this soil will come into their own, Sons of the Mohawk, Sons of Pocahontas, Bread of these rocks and mountains, blood and bone. THE MOUNTAIN WITH WINGS Red Eagle, Red Eagle, The red man's own mountain! Red Eagle, Red Eagle, The mountain with wings, Where the butterflies fly in white rings, Where the chipmunks display an especial fantastic And seem to be spreading red wings. Red Eagle, Red Eagle, where sunrise and sunset Seem to be spreading red wings. Red Eagle, Red Eagle, where waterfalls shake the walls Seem to be splitting the canyons and valleys, Seem to be spreading red wings. Red Eagle Where he Who sleeps under That wonder, The aspen, Dreams that its whiteness is wrapped round in fire, Till it seems to be spreading red wings, And climbed by a feathered green serpent that stings. Oh mountain, endowed with the pride of the bird That sings not, but rules every songster that sings, And sets me to singing and lifting my head, And spreading my sky with red wings, red wings! Red Eagle, Red Eagle, The red man's own mountain, That seems to be spreading red wings. THE RED EAGLE LOVE SONG The Forest-Ranger's Courtship We would be stakers of homesteads and ranches, Yet have our homes regal. Then, We would be breakers of underbrush branches On that mountain, Red Eagle. We would be rakers of alfalfa and hay, By sweat earn our bread. Yet:â We would be lazy and sassy and gay, By the moment be led. We would be bakers of clams, in lost island sands, Far from good people; Be great forsakers of prim and restraining hands, And the church steeple. We would be eagles red, Blazing through all the year, Lovers of Red Gods and unknown to any fear. By Red Eagle Mountain I make you my love song, By Red Eagle Mountain, I lift up my voice, and rejoice. THE PARABLE OF DEEPNESS âIn Glacier Park is a bottomless lake,â said a guide on the east side to me. âIf you tie a big rock to a system of clothes lines, Tied end to end, forever and ever, You will find it more deep than the sea.â âNow where is this lake?â I asked the smart guide. âWest of the Ranges,â said he. âIn Glacier Park is a bottomless lake,â said a guide on the west side to me. âIf you let down a system of trout lines and wire, Tying on more, all your heart may desire, With a horseshoe for plumb on the end of the string, You cannot determine the depth of the thing. You will find it more deep than the sea.â âNow where is this lake?â I asked that gay guide. âEast of the Ranges,â said he. âIn the ocean there sure is a bottomless place,â Said a sailor in New York harbor to me. âIf you let down a cable with plummets to fit You will find it more deep than the bottomless pit. It's a terrible place to get drownded at seaâ We cannot dive down and rescuers be.â âNow where is this water?â I asked the salt sailor. âJust south of the North Pole,â said he. âIn the ocean there sure is a bottomless place,â Said a San Francisco sailor to me. âThe sea spiders come when we ship in that sea And they fasten their threads to the ribs of the ship, Shark-proof-silk, resisting the lip Of sharks of the highest or lowest degree. And the spiders spin down, and swim down, and dive down, And bite everything in the green-weed-town, And clear things away, and swim down, and say:â âOh where is the floor of this fathomless sea?â But the sea is as deep as the bottomless pit. No spider has ever dived down into it, Not a spider of highest or lowest degree.â âNow where is this water?â I asked the proud sailor. âJust north of the South Pole,â said he. Now the China boy there in the chop suey dive Serving us whisky in tea Sat down and continued the epic of deepness, Delighting the salt and his sweetie and me. He said, âThere's a well in Confucius' back yard Overhung by a plain little cinnamon tree. The well has run dry, but is deep as the sky. There's a star day and night you can see If you put your fool head in the shadowy boughs, Looking down through black leaves of the cinnamon tree. âYou can let down a kite string as long as a river And tie on bright jades that will glitter and quiver, In the light of the star in the depths of the well. It goes down like the slenderest glittering dragon, And passes all side-doors and cellars of Hell, Making dry rainbows there in the flagon. No thread has ever gone down to the star, The jewelled lost hub of Confucius' blue car.â âNow where is this well?â inquired the gay sailor. âI would like to go there with a spider and trailer.â âIn Confucius' back yard,â said the boy with a stare. âI'm American born and have never been there, But I heard my great-grandfather say it was there.â When I climb on Sun-Mountain and look up at noon Then new revelations of glory come soon And the sky is a lake more deep than the dream Of cowboy or sailor, or China boy gay. And I need no kite strings to measure the way. When I sleep on that height There is midnight more deep Than the bottomless pit, or the seas, or the wells, Or the wise men's great tales of sea spiders and hells. When the great moon comes up I lie in a sea Where the moon is the ship of God comforting me, But between are wonders more deep than ever may be In the lonely and strange lost green floors of the sea, Or the deep drowned flowers in the depths of the Polar Sea.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HERE BEGINS THE BEE, DRAGON FLY AND FLYING MACHINE SERIES THE BEE The Bee that left a smoke trail In the sky, After he kissed The Firewood Bloom good-by. THE DRAGON FLIES The Dragon Flies of the Silver Lake Were flying machines Of an ancient make. PATHFINDER OF THE AIR With a Medal for Lowell H. Smith, Inscribed by the Explorers Club of New York âCircumnavigator and Pathfinder of the Air.â Pathfinder of the air, the nations honor you. They envy the adventure and the goal. They honor the hard pathway of Ulysses The wave-surmounting cloud-compelling soul, The courage of Columbus in new oceans And Magellan's circumnavigating glory. Like great migrating birds, their wings in rhyme All men may fly around the world to-day, Because you did it first, and for all time, And made Magellan's victory your own story.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HERE BEGINS THE MOHAWK SECTION I have used âThe Mohawkâ in many previous poems, in other books as a total symbol of all the Red Indian Tribes and all the Red Indian Gods from the beginning to the end of time. BY THE MOHAWK'S BUCKSKIN DOOR The Forest-Ranger's Courtship Do we return to the Rockies? Surely we camp once more There on the peaks of to-morrow By the Mohawk's buckskin door. The old Gods and the new Gods Must fight in student hearts. When the new tribes seem most sleepy Another war-whoop starts. When the old Gods seem but basalt, We hear a sistrum ring. In the end of the years Will Thoth, the scribe, Or the Mohawk be our king? THE MOHAWK COMES Bring my green-gold weeds and trees To speak of his approach, The Mohawk. Bring my roaring waterfalls To speak of his approach, The Mohawk. Bring the fearful glaciers To speak of his approach, The Mohawk. Bring the terrible mountain forms To speak of his approach, The Mohawk. For when weeds and trees are visions blazing through the midnight black, When waterfalls are like great ghosts that walk across the storm and wrack, When visions of vast glaciers bring the ghosts of rocks of old, And the mountains seem to march and earthquakes with new clouds enfold, Then the Mohawk brings the ages, brings the Indian ages back! CONCERNING THE MOUNTAIN IN GLACIER PARK CALLED âALMOST A DOGâ Almost a dog But really a prologue, To a wind song whose rhythms make ripples in creeks. Almost a dog But really a dialogue Between my sick soul and the guardian it seeks. Almost a dog But really an epilogue To an epic of hiding and seeking for weeks. Almost a barking dog Really a monologue, A mountain that barks of itself at the sky, And all the invisible things that go by. Almost a dog But really a thunder cloud, Changing again to a mystery and mist. Almost a dog But really a fire-log, Really a sunset where rose clouds are kissed By storms that keep troth and keep tryst. Almost a dog But really a Mohawk's arm, A tomahawk held in a warrior's fist. Almost a dog But really a jewel, A vast and incredibly deep amethyst. Almost a barking dog Really a monologue, A mountain that barks of itself at the moon, Yet a sod so friendly, so shaggy, so wagging, When one lays a tired hand in the deep bear grass; The mountainside turns like a friend to you soon To guard you and guide you home under the moon, A dog like a friendly bear under the moon. Almost a dog Yet really a monologue, Of the heart-roaring Mohawk singing in wonder How mystery hangs like tree-moss from the heavens. Almost a dog But really the thunderâ The Red Indian Thunder, the Thunder, the Thunder! THE RED INDIAN BRIDE The Forest-Ranger's Courtship There is a bridal hour In my ancestral story That comes each year with overwhelming power. I remember the wild pioneer The younger son from England and from Spain, Who took the Red Indian bride On the mossy rock in the rain, Somewhere in Virginia, Or somewhere in Tennessee, And set the Picts and Scots forever free, And turned loose on America The Saxons and the Angles, Wearing Odin's raven wings And Thor's war-bangles; Wearing the sort of feathers Fit for manâ The feathers of Black Hawk and Powhatan, And made me an Indian chief. Though I am worlds away (There are mountain ranges between us) Yet that deep-wood yesterday Is nearer to my bridegroom blood Than all other natural things. If I have sons, let them be red, Painted Red Indian kings. THE FLYING PAPOOSES We have seen the Flying Papooses Climbing Hawaii's crown; We have seen them in visions in Mesa Verde, In Yosemite's out-door town Of towers that never will tumble down. We have seen the Flying Papooses In dreams, in the great redwood trees, Flying and dancing in air, Above the sequoia's knees, We have seen the Flying Papooses In the Yellowstone Park in our dream. They jump into boiling waters, They sing in the geyser steam. We have seen the Flying Papooses Diving in Crater Lake, And marvelous medicine make, There with the birds and the wildflowers On the steep bank of Crater Lake. We have dreamed of the Flying Papooses Using snowshoes on Mount Rainier; And climbing to dawn stars in snowshoes, And riding the skies on moose-backs and deer. We have dreamed of the Flying Papooses How they captured Glacier Park, Changing for an hour From Flying Papooses To young wolves that race and bark. We have seen them fly up Mount McKinley From the deep of the valley to where The peak lifts tremendous snowstorms, And throws them like flowers through the air. In all of the Parks of the nation, By these wings is your spirit set free, The wings of the Flying Papooses, In the mountains like primitive temples, The forests and cliffs like the sea. By the wings and the cries of the Flying Papooses Is your soul long in prison, Given its pride, And its sails, And set free. THE FOURTH RETURN TO SUN-MOUNTAIN The Forest-Ranger's Courtship From clear St. Marys Lake to the high blue We saw the angels climb in sunset light, their wings all new. And so in rain and storm and rainbows We swore to climb, too, To climb those celestial ladders every one, Past the mountain peak called Going-to-the-Sun. A double mind was ours. We saw those angels as we see the flowers, And yet we felt ourselves as Indians Without aureoles Serving Red Gods whose names were never written On old scrolls; Serving storms and stars Alien to that angel band. So while the angels filled the sky The Indian storm Gods danced upon the mountain peaks, The glaciers, the forests, the water and the land. And yet with Indians and angels we were one, All going, going, going, To the Sun, the Sun, the Sun! IDOL OF THE DEER Behold:â The steps to the Idol of the deer, The idol was a Cloud in the highest sky, The steps were clouds Above Sun-Mountain. THE GOLDEN ORCHIDS The Forest-Ranger's Courtship In the snow-born waterfalls, we found the golden orchids, Nodding in the moss beneath the thunder. Though many a snowstorm, there, had come and gone, Though many a wind had deeply snowed them under, They nodded there, and slept in spite of thunder, In delicate, serene, and golden wonder. TO THE TALLEST ASPEN OF GLACIER PARK The Forest-Ranger's Courtship You are marvelous in your power to soar. Too white to be a tree, Too slim to be a tree, And yet so strong, outshining all The bright-boughed pines around; Making the stream about your feet Sing with a holy sound From the consecrated ground. You are a gate of Paradise, The only one to-day that we have found. THE OLD MAIL COACH TO BELTON The Forest-Ranger's Courtship The old mail coach to Belton Seemed to sweep the purple seas: The old mail coach to Belton, In the drizzle and the fog. The old mail coach to Belton Went through an old burnt forest, Past blackened mast and log; But our hearts were gay with the conquest Of the world and all the seas. Our hobnailed shoes were water-soaked, We were mud up to the knees; But with the ancient silken sails, We swept purple seas, For our hearts were tides within us, Greater than all the seas. THE FAWNS AND THE STRANGER The Forest-Ranger's Courtship The fawns across the farmyard in the rain Leap with a grace astonishing the eye. They know the farmer, and they trust the farmer, But watch the stranger with a weather eye; And if the stranger quivers but a feather, The fawns leap over the fence and say âgood-by.â THE DEER OF QUARTZ RIDGE The Forest-Ranger's Courtship The deer of Quartz Lake, Quartz Creek, and Quartz Ridge, Leap to a rhythm that sets me afire. They jump the rail fences, jump the barb wire. They live in their leaping, they hold their heads high, These quivering, shivering, delicate wonders, The deer of Quartz Lake, that rush by. THE WRITHING, IMPERFECT EARTH The Forest-Ranger's Courtship Dear love, if you and I had perfect love, No doubt we could not face the imperfect earth. We have a little, struggling, deathless love, Struggling up through the writhing, imperfect earth. We who would make of every breath a song, We who would make of every vista, peace, Struggle up like rooted growing things, Like pines at the mountain top in stony earth, Struggling up through the writhing, imperfect earth. Yet now, dear love, we proudly remake our vows, Standing like gods beneath the noon or the moon. Yet we bend with love flowers on our brows, Renew them soon if they wither soon. Yet, my darling, darling, though we wound, Misunderstand, and struggle for our peace, Still kisses, dearest kisses, give release; And the sod blooms with a flower of deathless worth, And secret heavenly mirth, The flower of faith. The angel flower of faith, That strange scrap of snow, That magical sweet wraith, Struggling up through the writhing, imperfect earth. BEGGING PARDON The Forest-Ranger's Courtship There is only one way to forgive, With a whole heart. There is only one way to forgive, Take a new start. There is only one way to beg pardon, And that is abjectly, completely. And so I beg pardon, And will you forgive me Sweetly? I SAW A ROSE IN EGYPT The Forest-Ranger's Courtship I saw a rose in Egypt Where many a lotus blooms. In Egypt, in my dream, I saw a rose. Alone there in the sand, The glory of the world, In Egypt, by the stream, I saw a rose. WHEN YOU AND I WERE SINGERS IN THE MOUNTAINS The Forest-Ranger's Courtship When you and I were singers, were singers in these mountains, A million and a million years ago, We built a nest of silk From the fireweed of these mountains, And sang and sang, and saw the summers go. When you and I were singers, were singers in these mountains, We built our nest in echoing Indian Pass, But we called it in bird-language:â âThe place of echoing grass.â The longest sweetest echo the world of birds may know, We heard there, we heard there long ago. We could sing long sweet sentences And hear the whole come backâ A whispering of trembling lovers' words, A whispering of ardent little birds. When you and I were singers, were singers in these mountains, We were just such mountain larks as sing at dawn, Now making great cantatas with a chorus of dim echoes, Calling sweet lovers to this sacred lawn, Saying: âSet free your hearts and sing to the dawn!â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE BEGINNING OF THE FOREST-RANGER'S HONEYMOON THE HOUR OF FATE The First Song of the Forest-Ranger's Honeymoon The log cabin hearth fire dies away; The embers turn to ashes, and we wait; It is the hour of fate. Here, by these two dim candles, we bend, Each to each, at the riotous day's end. Oh, the tremendous leaping of our souls At dawn this morning because of the mountains' gold! Till we improvised in song: meter and rhyme. Oh, the tremendous leaping of ambition When new strength came with the wind, and the high climb. How we planned and plotted against gloom, Against the sorrows of the world and time, The gray hairs of the years, The sod of the grave. How we planned and plotted against tears. Now we remember the red rocks at noon, The great blue rivers and the yellow moss; Now we remember the white aspen bowers; Now we remember the purple lake, and how we swam across; Now we remember the crimson Indian paint; Now we remember the orange autumn leaves. The embers turn to ashes and we wait. It is the hour of fate. Either the mighty bridal hour or the closing of love's gate. BY AN OLD UNLIGHTED CANDLE By an old Unlighted candle in the cabin In the moonlight Strange flowers Went up like arrows Shot into the air. Love-darts sprang up By an old unlighted Candle in a cabin In the moonlight. FINDING THE MYSTERIOUS CABIN The Forest-Ranger's Honeymoon We found an empty cabin By a bend in the river, In a forest of poplars, of aspens, lodge-pole pines, In a circle of the steepest cliffs our eyes had ever known, All of weird designs. The narrowest, strangest valley Our souls might hope to own, Full of bewitching signs, And deep as to the center of the earth It seemed this morning As we peeped down round the pass, To take the reckoning, And watch the dawn adorning Glacial snow and grass. Here in the empty cabin, we found our heart's delight, And whispered plans to make the world all rhyme; And whispered plans to find the golden heart of this strange time; And planned deep deeds in this deep place Throughout the forest night. THE JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH The Forest-Ranger's Honeymoon Going-to-the-Sun is Going-to-To-morrow, Going-to-Adventure, âwith bells on,â as it were. Once upon a time, We had a strange adventure, When we were dressed in feathers, leaves, and fur. We found a very deep and quite extinct volcano, With many circles of tall spruce around it, And devil's club around it. On and down we wandered when we found it; Round and round we climbed inside around it. The volcano was so wide The eagles soared across it; The echoes of its corridors were wonderful to hear; And when we threw down pebbles, the thunder kept increasing, And sent a deep earth trumpeting, to the inner ear. Round and down we wandered, Hand in hand kept going, Eating huckleberries and blueberries all the way; Killed and cooked big game, as down and down we wandered, Till the blazing hour of noon was all we had of day. All the flowers of Glacier Park bloomed down to the center. A whispering wildcat soon made friends, and led us farther down. He beckoned and he whined, He skipped and rolled and signed, With manners like a chipmunk's,â Until he brought us to a wildcat-town. Each cat had a tree, Each cat had a cave, Each cat took his turn at keeping deer, on the slope. They fed us on deer's blood;â They were like old friendly Indians, And sent us farther earthward, with good-will signs, and hope. In and down we wandered, following little streams, Finding jeweled pebbles and Aztec designs On the mattocks and the picks and drills of the jewel mines. In and down we wandered, Past many jeweled wonders, And as the shadows tried us, And as the nights grew longer, The fireflies flew before us. We lit brush fires to guide us, We carried tall pine torches, And the fireflies helped beside.... And then new lights began to shine On a phosphorescent tree, That was our guide. A tree like a giant aspen That grew on a narrow roadwayâ One side of each aspen leaf shone with silvery white; Who had put the trees here In a winding path transcendent To guide us when the sun no more gave light? The way was never lonely, The way was never weary, For we had one another and loved as now to-day. The wonders all went past us, We played and we adventured, And took it all for granted, as this cabin here to-day. We do not know who built it, It seems left for half a century. Its history in the forest is as unknown and as strange As that wild lost volcano we found behind the range. Down and down we wandered, The aspens, giant candles, Lit our way as these two candles Light our shack to-night. We had our loving there as here, Our big pine beds of hearts' delight, And love's eternal rite. Down and down we wandered, To the wild earth's center. There we found strange bluebell flowers whose music could be heard, And wore them for our pleasure, Frolicked and were absurd. And there we found a nest of birds with eggs big as the moon, Round as the moon. They broke their bright shells singing, And soon with father and mother, Up the whirling whirl were winging, Up the whirling fantasy Were whirling, soaring, singing soon. One of them stayed to beckon, One of them stayed to whisper, Just as the wildcat whispered, With manners like a chipmunk, though as big as any moon. There, with bluebells all over us, He tied us to one feather, And then all three together Went up, went up, to his volcano tune. Cry of a lost volcano! Cry of the dear earth's center! Cry of a dream volcano, where the fire is now a bird, A bird and yet a giant ghost, singing a giant word! A word that means great bird-love, A word that means bright nesting, A word that means dim wings of fire, And love and vast unspent desire. And this he sang, as on he sprang; He was tender with us, too, And left us here beside this shack, while he leaped into the blue, And we waved at him with bluebells While he leaped into the blue. We called him âGoing-to-the-Sunâ And âGoing-to-To-morrow.â If these were our adventures, in our silly yesterday, (With bells on, with bells on) We are going to adventure now, Going-to-To-morrow; And it is just past midnight, and the candle flames are gay. The great fire-logs are roaring, Whispering and singing The love song of to-morrow and adventure and new day. Going-to-the-Sun is Going-to-To-morrow And is going out to frolic and to play.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE SECTION ENTITLED THE CANDLE IN THE CABIN IS LIGHTED THE CANDLE IN THE CABIN The Forest-Ranger's Honeymoon When you and I were driving herds and ranching on the sun, Skinning mules and building towns and cooking for the boss, Living where the mountains and the plains and rivers cross, We had our vast adventures and our blood-letting days. For cattle thieves are mighty on the trails of the sun; When they capture big-bull prizes, their day of glory rises. But we caught them and we lynched them On the great plains of the sun. And those were cruel realistic days. Yes, we kept our cattle safe, the cattle of the Sun-chief. Bulls like the Bulls of Texas bellowed there, And we rode their backs like gods and frolicked there. The great sea in the sun is like the air; And the great wind in the sun is like the sea; And we rode the bulls of wonder Through the ocean round the year, Over the ocean floor; And gloried without fear. When we were cook and cowboy in the tremendous sun, We built a shack of silver rocks and rain. For the light is like the rain In the storm-clouds of the sun, And our magic harnessed clouds and rocks and rain. And we built a rainbow shack of rocks and rain, And lit a wax-flower candle in the night there in the rain; For night comes there despite the blazing rain. We lit a little candle made of wax from wax-flower berries, From the highest forest of the mountain heights. And there we kissed and sang, As here we kiss and sing, Teaching one another dear delights. When you and I were children of the tremendous sun, Serpent-stranglers, and horse-wranglers, Bull-whackers and mule-skinners, We hardly knew Just what to do. We had the strength and leisure, (We had ten thousand years) So we rode a great red eagle Through the blaze and blue. We looked down on our mountains, We looked down on our cities, We looked down on our oceans, On our bull herds, proud and vain, And on our playhouse built of rocks and rain. Then we flew to Glacier Park, And turned to aspen trees, Here on great Sun Mountain, and dreamed here, In the sunshine, rocks and rain, Dreamed again of Going-to-the-Sun, And saw April going and returning, And forest fires and years, And saw Red Eagle turn into a mountain, Through the years. Then we were born as lovers, Singing as we are now, Singing, desiring, Burning a little candle in a log house in the rain. And the shadows thrown by candlelight Are light, not midnight darkness. They fill the midnight darkness with the starlight of our pain:â Our hearts' celestial revel, Sun-born, without stain, In that rain called the starlight, In that rain called the sunshine, In that candle-flame, called rain. BY THE OLDEST TRAILS The Forest-Ranger's Honeymoon The moose they say is a whimsical beast. The pack rat is a curious thing. The wood wasp, too, is a curious thing. But a stranger thing was on the wing, A flying machine, the fire patrol, Heard from behind a tremendous mountain, Humming on like America's soul. It was hid behind the mountain top, Yet humming and humming again and again. Then we slept all night in a cabin unused, Yet a telephone spoke again and again, The ringing pulse of America's blood, Calling us back by its very sound To America's streets again and again. So deeper and deeper on we climbed To where the fallen cabins are found By the oldest trails, a lifetime old. And the waterfalls roared to keep us proud, And not be misled by the hum and the ring Back to where the skyscrapers swing. THE DRAGON FLY GUIDE The Forest-Ranger's Honeymoon A dragon fly by bright Waterton Lake, And a flying machine in the sky, Ran competition for our admiration The day that summer went finally by. The flying machine disappeared in the west Across hundreds and hundreds of trails, The dragon fly dallied in buckler metallic Fish and reptilian scales, Whizzing this way and that, By bright Waterton Lake, And seemed to be showing the way we should take, While the underbrush dragged at our knees. Then the dragon fly led To a dimmer lake, The home of a somnolent, indolent breeze; The dragon fly led To one lone lake, The true lovers' own, The sweet secret lake, Past hundreds and hundreds of trees, Hundreds and hundreds of trees. WHY DO WE NOT RETURN? The Forest-Ranger's Honeymoon Dear, we were in Egypt Not so long ago. We sailed the Nile, We saw the sacred Ibis come and go. We sailed among Papyrus reeds, We saw the temples burn In the light of the desert dawn. Why do we not return? Here by our cabin candle, With Red Indian Gods in the air, We look at our hieroglyphic book Till Thoth is standing there. We look at the hieroglyphic book Till Hathor shakes her bells, Till Ra comes from the heavens And Set comes from the hells. Man is a mixed breed ever, Remembering yesterday. He looks to the East for wisdom, Westward for his play. He looks East in old memory, Westward in new hope. We rope the wild-west horses, But scribe Thoth weaves the rope. We stoop to kiss sweet Hathor Who sleeps by our fire there; But just as we have touched her lips, There's a wild call in the airâ The Mohawk comes, the Mohawk comes, And we hear his drums roll near From great Red Eagle Mountain, Next moment he is here! THE INDIAN GIRLâMY GRANDMOTHER The Forest-Ranger's Honeymoon I think of just one bride Besides this pale bride here, It is my Indian grandmother Of a far yesteryear. I think of her so often, Her baskets, feathers, and knives. I know she was good to her man, The bravest of wives. I am nearer her kin by far, Than the British who strut and boast That they are the kin of William the Norman, And his ravishing host. And I back my one drop of blood From this Indian girl Against all the blood of the Normans, Where the British flags unfurl. BEHIND SUN-MOUNTAIN The Forest-Ranger's Honeymoon We climbed to the glacier beyond the trail, Beyond the flowers and the shale and the woods. We built a campfire there in the rain Of three old roots, broken to punk, And our discarded goods. The campfire burned against the fog, Against the ice and the rain and snow, And we asked what the wise in glaciers ought to know. Then on we climbed, and down we climbed, And built a better fire, In the night, in the rain, in the fog and snow, And watched the long night go, Dry and warm by a glorious furious fire. At midnight, for an hour, the sky Was clear as a crystal pool, Every star in its place, Each mountain stood in its place And spelled its name In the happy midnight hieroglyphic school. But soon the fog came down again, Soon to renew the trial. The great fire dried the rain in the fog, And dried our shoes and our coats with a smile, And there we slept awhile. THE FOG COMES AND GOES The Forest-Ranger's Honeymoon In the valley of ten thousand flowers The fog came down, we built a fire That wiped out fog and dark and rain, And gave a golden glory to desire. And there, on a bed of deep pine-boughs We gloried, and told tales of old. Strange beasts were rustling in the bushâ We feared not, for one night were bold. We dragged great logs from the mist's edge. We built that fire to the great sky, And midnight saw the great fog lift, Clear stars and mountains fill the world, While on that fir-bough bed, Like mountain-lions in their cave we curled, Two lovers, conquerors of the fog, Sheltered by ten great fire-logs, And conquerors of the world. A GREAT SHADOWY DAY The Forest-Ranger's Honeymoon Looking out the window Of the little log cabin We found in the lone lorn wood, We saw the green world passing by Throughout the shadowy day. Under Mount Custer, We saw the shadows and we called them good; Under the high trees, Under the shadow of the bushes on the cliff, Under the shadow of the flowers, And the misty valley's flowery hours, We saw the shadowy day go by And found it a pageant and a play. We found a joy in that great shadowy day. THE BREATH OF THE WIND The Forest-Ranger's Honeymoon The winds that come across the pass to-night While I watch the fire, hour after hour, Come from the west, speak of the western sky That changed from rose to gray, And gray to rainbow butterfly And to carnation flower. All those strange colors change now to strange sounds; In winds the twilight speaks the whole night through, And so I heap new logs upon the fire, And think, my sleeping sweetheart, still, of you. Hid there beneath the fir-bough shelter, built By our own hands at sunset, Now a dark and darling mystery, With deeper mysteries to keep. I hear your breath, oh, sleeping sweetheart, As you stir in sleep. So the dark transcends both time and deathâ Your whispered breathing is immortal breath. THE QUAIL RECEIVES A GUEST The Quail on her nest Received a little dream-cloud For a guest. THE BABY THAT CAME FROM THE FERN Behold:â Where the Honeymoon trails Meander and linger And tangle and turn The Baby that came From the curling fern. THE TIME WHEN THINGS HAD BETTER NAMES The Forest-Ranger's Honeymoon These flowers and beasts and birds and trees, Mountains and bees, Have not the splendid names They once had long ago, When you and I sat round the fire, Our twelve strong sons there in a row, Centuries ago. They brought new names For each new thing They brought into the campfire ring, Words our eldest son, the poet, Then began to sing. We wove those names into a world, Centuries ago. These rocks and lakes are much the same, But the old names pass. We had better names for rivers, And for the white bear grass. We had better names for every mountain And for every tree. We almost hear them in the night, Alone by candlelight. If we wait here by the light, The names may come to you and me. Elusive now, hiding now, The dawn may set them free, And bring those twelve strong sons And the eldest son, the singing chieftain, Back to you and me. THE BAT By the Candle In the Cabin I heard the voice Of a great Pack-rat. It spoke, And the vision cameâ Just Like That. âThe United States Wears a great black hat. Behold:â The descent Of the Night On the Mountainsâ In the form Of a great Black Bat.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HERE BEGINS THE FOREST-RANGER'S SECOND HONEYMOON ONCE MORE When the thousand love-gods Knocked at the door, We lit the candle of the dream Once more. THE WHIRLWIND Said the Red Indian Medicine-Man to his son:â When you take your bride Be a bull of power. Be an eagle Flying over red-eagle, A whirlwind Going up a flower. THE SUMMER ARROW OF SUNSHINE The arrow that bent In the summer wind Was straight And terrible In the storm. THE CRYSTALLINE CROWN The blossom That came When the storm died down, Was decked with a dewy Crystalline Crown. THE RAT-SOULED FOE THE CITY FEARS The Forest-Ranger's Second Honeymoon When you and I were in the lands Far to the west of this strange camp (It seems to us but yesterday) We lit a purple-flaming lampâ No, a lanternâat the dusk And walked through a still street And heard no feet but far off feet. We clambered at the guarded gate, Of the inner city there. We said, âA whispering foe comes near! We heard him on the stair. High on the tower of the outer gate. We know that he will come, We have owl's eyes, we have owl's ears, The rat-souled foe the city fears Will come.â But they woke not at the city gate. We left the city to its fate. We stole away at the dawn of day, We reached the forest far away, We saw the city burning down, The far off, terrible, heedless town. But no foe came to spoil delight In our wooded cabin, day or night. Our dream rolled on for many a year Till we woke dreaming, singing here, And saw the city and its fire In this fir-bough bed, our heart's desire, In these knapsacks, All of life and play And saw all cities burn away; And saw all dreams come and go, Except star-sky and sunlit sky Over the forests and mountains high. A MEMORY OF BOYHOOD The Forest-Ranger's Second Honeymoon Once, alone in the wilderness I built myself a fire, In an island in a little stream, alone, And the water spoke, With one hundred thousand voices, Till the day broke. How the mists rolled down from the mountain, Bringing happiness; How the trees were friends to heal my loneliness; How the trembling island seemed the cloud of my pride; The campfire was a chariot where my Elijah soul could ride. How the mariposa lilies in the dim light gleamed, The stately dress of the wilderness Where I lay and dreamed. Oh, once alone in the wilderness I built myself a fire! Now, my love and I, this night, build again a fire, And the strange God-breath of the wilderness Turns to desire. THE CITY OF GLASS The Forest-Ranger's Second Honeymoon Beside the lake we call âThe City of Glassâ We watched our red, dear afternoon go past, Red with Indian-paint and heart's blood hoursâ Innocent were all the other flowers. What rhyme of love or shout of love can sing Of that deep grass and secret rock and spring? Of your sun blaze of whiteness and your laughter My still heart must remember ever after? THE PICTURE OF THE HEART-BOAT Behold:â The boat called âwonder,â Called: âCalm after thunder,â It is painted with hearts. The boat on the lake called:â âThe City of Glass.â THE FISH WITH THE BRACELETS Through the candle of dreams We saw them passâ Each wearing a beautiful Bracelet of brass, The little fish Of the lake called:â âThe City of Glass.â THE FIR-TREE Heavy with secret shadows That are sweet As kissing rhymes, The Candle in the Cabin Is a fir-tree Sometimes. THE APPLE TREE Bearing two sweet apples As sweet as kissing rhymes, The Candle in the Cabin Is an apple-tree Sometimes. THE MUSICAL WIND To the strange flower On the mountainâ A Poet from afar, A wind from the North Star Made secret rhymes As sweet as kisses are, Rhymes that kissed each other Many times,â Laughing little rhymes. THE DRIFTWOOD BED The Forest-Ranger's Second Honeymoon The little driftwood bed By Dragon Fly Lake, Under the noon sun, Cure for a little heart-ache. The little driftwood bed, The song of the dragon waves, The free love, the free north wind, And a thousand sorrows in their graves. The little driftwood bed, The pillow of pebbles and sand, And our hearts again wedded Like the water and the land. LIKE THEIR FATHERS OF OLD The Forest-Ranger's Second Honeymoon Far from the world and its wrong, They love as the pioneers loved, Kissing by firelight and candlelight, In the cabin there in the woods. Face turns to shadowed face, Body to body's grace, All for Love's delight, Kissing the whole night long, Through the terrible storm In the cabin, pine-ribbed and strong. Lovers in far away places Kiss by electric light, By bright automobile light, By movie theater half-light, By wriggling street sign light. But like their fathers of old, These are kissing by candlelight, Through the terrible storm And hearing a night bird's song, The night-raven's song. THE ASPEN LEAF LOVERS The Forest-Ranger's Second Honeymoon Two happy lovers on one pillow in the forest, One pine bed in the forest, Singing the night away! The moon was almost full; The little lake was still; The aspen leaves were gay Against the midnight blue, Quivering all night through. The lovers kissedâ Their lips were like the leavesâ And their hearts quivered, too.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A NEW SECTION ENTITLED THE BUTTERFLY CITIZENS THREE LITTLE FLOWER SHIPS Three little Flower-ships Went sailing by, With butterflies For sails. THE MUSICAL BUTTERFLY The musical Butterfly, Whose wings are a harp, And the dots Are the notes Of the tunes That he plays. THE STORM-BLOWN BUTTERFLIES Two Storm-blown Butterflies, Kings of the Storm, With their little Crowns Quite groggy. THE PRAIRIE BUTTERFLY The prairie butterfly That dreamed of mountain-birds, (Birds that were veiled Like brides) Was followed by His dreams Into the mountains. THE BUTTERFLY CITIZENS Indian Pass is golden green, Indian Pass is high; Over it, the glaciers, Under it, scraps of sky. We climbed over Indian Pass And thought of Springfield Town, Far away in Illinois, While the wind roared down, Springfield seemed a star afar, a far off jewel flame, Our home-town was a wonder-point, Or merely one more name. The real town, the one town, Was the sod beneath our feet, With city streets complete: With the Indian Paint, the bear grass, The ferns that toss, the fireweed floss, The hundred sorts of mountain moss; And up and down, across, across, Flew the mountain citizens, The shining snow-line butterflies With peacock-winged eyes. THE PROCESSION POLITICAL Each insect Flings off His repression! The butterfly Torch-light Procession! THE PRESIDENT The butterflies Chose for their president A great big lily of glass. We saw their Election-rockets pass. And the Mountain-rocket flower Turned to a rocket And flew past The lily of glass. SNOW-BORN BUTTERFLIES The Forest-Ranger's Second Honeymoon When you and I were white, white snow-born butterflies, When you and I were butterflies, When these were new-born mountains, Back there a million geologic years, The loves of fearful beasts went on In all the valleys, And love was shame and fury, blood and tears. But we found new ways of loving In the hearts of mountain flowers, Close to glaciers, and the snow-line places. We read a shy delight in the wooing red and white Of all the tree-buds in their breeds and races. And we bound ourselves together, And flew through the blue air, Fluttering in naked sweetness in the sun. That was the day that this day on the fire-grass was begun. Still we are tender, and flower-taught, In the light of the sun. Love is not death and fury, blood and tears; Love holds no secret fears.
