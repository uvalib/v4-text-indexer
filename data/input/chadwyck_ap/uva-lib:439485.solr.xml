      <field name="fulltext">Psalm XXVIII. Long Metre. God the Refuge of the Afflicted. 1 To thee, O Lord, I raise my cries; My fervent prayer in mercy hear; For ruin waits my trembling soul, If thou refuse a gracious ear. 2 When suppliant tow'rd thy holy hill, I lift my mournful hands to pray, Afford thy grace, nor drive me still, With impious hypocrites away. 3 To sons of falsehood, that despise The works and wonders of thy reign, Thy vengeance gives the due reward, And sinks their souls to endless pain. 4 But, ever blessed be the Lord, Whose mercy hears my mournful voice, My heart, that trusted in his word, In his salvation shall rejoice. 5 Let every saint, in sore distress, By faith approach his Saviour God; Then grant, O Lord, thy pardoning grace, And feed thy church with heavenly food. Psalm XLIII. Common Metre. Safety in Divine Protection. 1 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause Against a sinful race; From vile oppression and deceit Secure me by thy grace. 2 On thee my stedfast hope depends, And am I left to mourn? To sink in sorrows, and in vain, Implore thy kind return? 3 Oh send thy light to guide my feet, And bid thy truth appear, Conduct me to thy holy hill, To taste thy mercies there. 4 Then to thy altar, oh my God, My joyful feet shall rise, And my triumphant songs shall praise, The God that rules the skies. 5 Sink not, my soul, beneath thy fear, Nor yield to weak despair; For I shall live to praise the Lord, And bless his guardian care. Psalm LII. Common Metre. The disappointment of the wicked. 1 Why should the mighty make their boast, And heavenly grace despise? In their own arm they put their trust, And fill their mouth with lies. 2 But God in vengeance shall destroy, And drive them from his face; No more shall they his church annoy, Nor find on earth a place. 3 But like a cultur'd olive grove, Dress'd in immortal green, Thy children, blooming in thy love, Amid thy courts are seen. 4 On thine eternal grace, O Lord. Thy saints shall rest secure, And all, who trust thy holy word, Shall find salvation sure. Psalm LII. Long Metre. The folly of self-dependence. 1 Why should the haughty hero boast, His vengeful arm, his warlike host, While blood defiles his cruel hand, And desolation wastes the land. 2 He joys to hear the captive's cry, The widow's groan, the orphan's sigh; And when the wearied sword would spare, His falsehood spreads the fatal snare. 3 He triumphs in the deeds of wrong, And arms with rage his impious tongue, With pride proclaims his dreadful power, And bids the trembling world adore 4 But God beholds, and with a frown, Casts to the dust his honours down: The righteous freed, their hopes recal, And hail the proud oppressor's fall. 5 How low th'insulting tyrant lies, Who dared th'eternrl Power despise; And vainly deem'd with envious joy, His arm almighty to destroy. 6 We praise the Lord, who heard our cries, And sent salvation from the skies; The saints, who saw our mournful days, Shall join our grateful songs of praise. Psalm LIV. Common Metre. 1 Behold us, Lord, and let our cry Before thy throne ascend, Cast thou on us a pitying eye, And still our lives defend. 2 For slaughtering foes insult us round, Oppressive, proud and vain, They cast thy temples to the ground, And all our rites prophane. 3 Yet thy forgiving grace we trust, And in thy power rejoice; Thine arm shall crush our foes to dust, Thy praise inspire our voice. 4 Be thou with those whose friendly hand, Upheld us in distress, Extend thy truth through every land, And still thy people bless. Psalm LIX. Short Metre. Prayer for national deliverance. 1 From foes, that round us rise, O God of heaven, defend, Who brave the vengeance of the skies, And with thy saints contend. 2 Behold, from distant shores, And desert wilds they come, Combine for blood their barbarous force, And through thy cities roam. 3 Beneath the silent shade, Their secret plots they lay, Our peaceful walls by night invade, And waste the fields by day. 4 And will the God of grace, Regardless of our pain. Permit secure that impious race, To riot in their reign? 5 In vain their secret guile, Or open force they prove; His eye can pierce the deepest veil, His hand their strength remove. 6 Yet save them, Lord, from death, Lest we forget their doom; But drive them with thine angry breath, Through distant lands to roam. 7 Then shall our grateful voice Proclaim our guardian God; The nations round the earth rejoice, And sound the praise abroad. Psalm LXX. Common Metre. Protection against Personal Enemies. 1 In haste, O God, attend my call, Nor hear my cries in vain; Oh let thy speed prevent my fall, And still my hope sustain. 2 When foes insidious wound my name, And tempt my soul astray, Then let them fall with lasting shame, To their own plots a prey. 3 While all that love thy name rejoice, And glory in thy word, In thy salvation raise their voice, And magnify the Lord. 4 O thou my help in time of need, Behold my sore dismay; In pity hasten to my aid, Nor let thy grace delay. Psalm LXXIX. Long Metre. For the distress of War. 1 Behold, O God, what cruel foes, Thy peaceful heritage invade; Thy holy temple stands defil'd, In dust thy sacred walls are laid. 2 Wide o'er the vallies, drench'd in blood, Thy people fall'n in death remain; The fowls of heaven their flesh devour, And savage beasts divide the slain. 3 Th'insulting foes, with impious rage, Reproach thy children to their face; “Where is your God of boasted power, “And where the promise of his grace.” 4 Deep from the prison's horrid glooms, Oh hear the mournful captives sigh, And let thy sovereign power reprieve, The trembling souls condemn'd to die. Psalm LXXXVIII. As the 113th. Loss of Friends, and absence of Divine Grace. 1 O God of my salvation, hear My nightly groan, my daily prayer, That still employ my wasting breath; My soul, declining to the grave, Implores thy sovereign power to save From dark despair and lasting death. 2 Thy wrath lies heavy on my soul, And waves of sorrows o'er me roll, While dust and silence spread the gloom My friends, belov'd in happier days, The dear companions of my ways, Descend around me to the tomb. 3 As, lost in lonely grief, I tread The mournful mansions of the dead, Or to some throng'd assembly go; Through all alike I rove alone, While, here forgot and there unknown, The change renews my piercing woe. 4 And why will God neglect my call? Or who shall profit by my fall, When life departs and love expires? Can dust and darkness praise the Lord? Or wake, or brighten at his word, And tune the harp with heavenly quires. 3 Yet thro' each melancholy day, I've pray'd to thee, and still will pray, Imploring still thy kind return.— But oh! my friends, my comforts, fled, And all my kindred of the dead Recall my wandering thoughts to mourn. Psalm CVIII. Common Metre. A Song of Praise. 1 Awake, my soul, to sound his praise, Awake my harp to sing; Join all my powers the song to raise, And morning incense bring. 2 Among the people of his care, And thro' the nations round; Glad songs of praise will I prepare, And there his name resound. 3 Be thou exalted, O my God, Above the starry train; Diffuse thy heavenly grace abroad, And teach the world thy reign. 4 So shall thy chosen sons rejoice, And throng thy courts above; While sinners hear thy pardoning voice, And taste redeeming love. Psalm CXXXVII. The Babylonian Captivity. 1 Along the banks where Babel's current flows, Our captive bands in deep dispondence stray'd, While Zion's fall in sad remembrance rose, Her friends, her children mingled with the dead. 2 The tuneless harp, that once with joy we strung. When praise employ'd and mirth inspir'd the lay, In mournful silence on the willows hung; And growing grief prolong'd the tedious day. 3 The barbarous tyrants, to increase the woe, With taunting smiles a song of Zion claim; Bid sacred praise in strains melodious flow, While they blaspheme the great Jehovah's name. 4 But how, in heathen chains and lands unknown, Shall Israel's sons, a song of Zion raise? O hapless Salem, God's terrestial throne, Thou land of glory, sacred mount of praise. 5 If e'er my memory lose thy lovely name, If my cold heart neglect my kindred race, Let dire destruction sieze this guilty frame; My hand shall perish and my voice shall cease. 6 Yet shall the Lord, who hears when Zion calls, O'ertake her foes with terror and dismay, His arm avenge her desolated walls, And raise her children to eternal day. Psalm CXL. Common Metre. 1 Protect us, Lord, from fatal harm; Behold our rising woes; We trust alone thy powerful arm, To scatter all our foes. 2 Their tongue is like a poison'd dart, Their thoughts are full of guile, While rage and carnage swell their heart, They wear a peaceful smile. 3 O God of grace, thy guardian care, When foes without invade, Or spread within a deeper snare, Supplies our constant aid. 4 Let falshood flee before thy face, Thy heavenly truth extend, All nations taste thy heavenly grace, And all delusion end. 5 With daily bread the poor supply, The cause of justice plead, And be thy church exalted high, With Christ the glorious head.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HYMNS AND Spiritual Songs. Hymn LXIII. Our Saviour present at his Table. 1 Come let us join the sacred song To our ascended Lord; Ye saints and angels round his throne, And we around his board. 2 Tho' rais'd beyond the worlds of light, His brighter glories shine, Where purer souls enjoy the sight And presence more divine. 3 Yet here, unseen by mortal eyes, The boundless God resides, Renews the atoning sacrifice And o'er the feast presides. 4 Let every hand that shares the food And every heart with fear, Feel the full presence of the God, That spreads his bounties here: 5 But Oh, the love, the wondrous love The bleeding Lord displays, Shall earth's united songs improve, And heaven's eternal praise. Hymn LXV. Innumerable mercies acknowledged. 1 In glad amazement, Lord, I stand, Amidst the bounties of thy hand; How numberless those bounties are! How rich, how various and how fair! 2 But oh, what poor returns I bring! What lifeless songs of praise I sing! Lord, I confess, with humble shame, My offerings scarce deserve the name. 3 Fain would my labouring heart devise Some nobler gift and sacrifice; It sinks beneath the mighty load That I should render to my God. 4 To him I consecrate my praise, And vow the remnant of my days; Enlarge my soul with grace divine, And make it worthier to be thine. 5 Give me at length an angel's tongue, To sound thro' heaven the grateful song; A theme so great, my voice shall raise, And crown eternity with praise. Hymn LXVI. For a vacant Congregation. 1 O God of heaven, whose gentle ray, Illumes the worlds of light, Thy wisdom rules the realms of day, And leads the host of night. 2 Behold thy waiting servants stand, And claim with feeble cries, Some skilful guide with gentle hand To lead us to the skies. 3 While absent from thy temple, Lord Like wandering flocks we stray We lose the memory of thy word And waste the sacred day. 4 And when, within these walls of thine We find our wonted place; How faint our feeble voices join To seek thy pardoning grace. 5 Almighty Saviour, hear our prayer, Some chosen servant raise, For us the bread of life to share And help our lips to praise. 6 Then in thy house, with joy unknown We'll raise a nobler song, Till we shall meet around thy throne, And join the heavenly throng. Hymn LXVII. For a New-Year's Day. 1 Eternal Source of every joy, Thy praise shall every voice employ, While we within thy courts appear, And sing the bounties of the year. 2 As worlds of glory round thee roll, Thy hand supports the stedfast pole, Directs the sun what hour to rise, And darkness when to veil the skies. 3 The flowery Spring at thy command Embalms the air, and paints the land; The blazing beams of Summer shine To raise the corn and cheer the vine. 4 Thy hand in Autumn richly pours The copious fruits along the shores, While wintry storms direct our eyes With fear and wonder to the skies. 5 Seasons, and months, and weeks, and days Demand returning songs of praise; The opening light and evening shade Shall see the cheerful homage paid. 6 And Oh, may our harmonious tongues In worlds unknown pursue the songs; And in those brighter courts adore, Where days and years revolve no more. Hymn LXVIII. A Hymn for Marriage. 1 Great God, who form'd for social joys Our natures by thy power and grace, And join'd in blest connubial ties, The parents of our favour'd race. 2 Our Saviour, our ascended Lord, In Cana once a heavenly guest, Whose bounty cheer'd the friendly board Whose presence grac'd the nuptial feast. 3 Attend with smiles of heavenly love, The pair thy sacred laws combine; Their union bless, their vows approve, And crown the rites with grace divine. 4 Let love assist their mutual toils, And every social bliss bestow; Increase each joy with friendly smiles, And share and soften every woo. 5 While each a kindly aid imparts, To run secure the heavenly race; And make their dwelling and their hearts, Perpetual temples of thy praise. 6 When death dissolves these sacred ties, May each to happier realms remove; There meet and range the peaceful skies, In bands of everlasting love. The End. MEDITATIOMS ON DEATH AND THE GRAVE Meditations on DEATH and the GRAVE. 1 I crave your calm attention now Till I reveal my Mind to you, And tell you where my Thoughts were led Out in the Tombs among the dead. 2 'Twas when the Care of Life had fled And Night's dark curtain spread his shade, And sweet Repose had clos'd mine Eyes I heard a voice that bid me rise— 3 Arise, go view your other Bed That death is making with the dead: Another dwelling you must have, Though little thought on, 'tis the Grave. 4 O solemn, solemn was the Time When first this Messenger came in, For to invite me for to come And view my lodging in the Tomb. 5 What frightful Apprehensions run In trickling Streams through ev'ry Vein. Dare not refuse, dare not obey— Beneath these frightful Thoughts I lay. 6 And here I shrunk, I darn't comply, But yet he did repeat this cry: I yielded then to go and head The gloomy Mansions of the dead. 7 Then I arose at his command And went to view the solemn Land While thoughts most frightfully did roll, That overwhelm'd my fainting Soul. 8 So great, so solemn was the thought To think how soon I must be brought To view Death's gloomy dark abode, I fell beneath the heavy load. 9 But soon a Voice to me was said, Arise, arise, be not afraid; Why do you fear to go and view This lodging soon will be for you, 10 Then I received strength and pow'r Sufficient for that very Hour. Then walking onwards to the Gate, That leads unto this solemn Place. 11 How slow, how solemn did the Door Move back for me to enter there, Till I had pass'd, there it remain'd, Then slowly moved back again. 12 Soon as we got within the Wall My guide gave me another call, Saying, come see the seat of sin, Walk round and see what it has done. 13 Then I went forth at his command, Walk'd round and viewed that solemn land, There I beheld the fatal Wound, Lie mouldering there beneath the Ground. 14 My thoughts soon back to Adam run And cried out, what have you done? Is this the dreadful Wound you gave, A Wound that sinks down to the Grave. 15 But I another wonder found To view the solemn Court around. All bound in Bands of Vanity, In perfect peace and Harmony. 16 How strangely did this sight appear To see the great and small lie here? The rich, the poor, the bond and free In band of Harmony agree. 17 There lay the gallant and the brave Both mouldering in the silent Grave. The Fool, the Beggar fill'd a seat As high as any in this Court. 18 There mighty Kings and Princes lay Chain'd down in silence in the Clay. There Counsellors and Judges cease To grant Advice or give release. 19 There I beheld the highest trust, Pull'd down, lay level'd with the Dust, The great, the mighty and the proud, They all lay equal'd in the croud. 20 Sworn Enemies there I beheld Had laid aside both sword and shield, The Hand forever had forgot To draw the spear, or heave a shot. 21 The slandrous and backsliding Tongue Lay bound in silence in the Tomb: the furious Temper's cease to rage And lay in Death's cold gloomy shades. 22 The bold Plasphemer's Tongue lay bound With chains of silence in the ground: His Oaths that once defil'd the Air Lay bound in Death's cold Prison there. 23 I saw the vigorous boldest Face Lay mouldering in this solemn Place; The active Limbs lost all ther Power In Death's decisive solemn Hour. 24 There I beheld and lo I found A lovely youth lye in the Ground: 'Twas but a little while before I saw him flourish like a Flower. 25 But O the shaft of Death was flung And cut the tender Flower down. Death's sharpen'd Arrows gave the wound, And now he moulders in the Ground. 26 The lovely Flesh, the sparkling Eyes Lay mouldering in Eternity; The blooming Cheek that once was worn Is now a Feast for odious Worms. 27 The lovely Frame the active Hands Lay bound in Death's cold Prison Bands. The burning Flesh, the harmless Tongue Lay mouldering in the silent Tomb. 28 The tender Skin, the curious Frame, The blooming Countenance was gone, The softest Flesh, the lovely Charms Lay clasp'd in Death's cold icy arms. 29 But here my thoughts they took a wing, Flew back and view'd the Race of Man, And lo I found the num'rous Throng Lay down in Death's cold shady Tomb. 30 Alas! the Ruins here I found Of all Mankind, lay in the Ground; From Adam down unto this Day. They all lay mouldering in Clay. 31 What Millions! Millions! had been slain By Death, that conquering, mighty King? What crowds of num'rous corps I found Lay cold and mouldering in the Ground. 32 Here was a melancholly Land; And Death, the King of Terrors reign'd, His mighty Hand his Sword he hurl'd, Made Inroads through the lower World. 33 But ah how frail this num'rous crowd? I view'd grim Death not satisfy'd Although he'd struck from Shore to Shore, The hungry Grave still cried more. 34 No nor enough he ne'er will have Till he has crouded in the Grave; His Mouth will never be confin'd Till he's devour'd all human Kind. 35 This faint Idea mine Eyes have seen Of things that's over, past and gone— And now upon another Theme Of things that's present, and to come. [My Mind it has been faintly lead] 1 My Mind it has been faintly lead Down in the Tombs among the dead, But on the living now I turn'd, To view his Paths and where he's bound. 2 There I upon a Hill behold Mine Eyes survey'd the boundless World, I saw all Nature's human race Move swiftly on towards the Place. 3 Yonder I saw a num'rous crowd All marching in this solemn Read, What steady step their feet did have, Advancing forward to the Grave. 4 What countless Millions in the Band, I saw them come from ev'ry Hand; All Nature seem'd to move along With equal speed towards the Tomb. 5 I saw Death mounted on a Horse, And riding through this num'rous Host; His Darts with cruel Death did fly Commissioned from God on high. 6 Some he would strike with sickness down On Beds of languishing and pain, And others with a mortal Shot He'd strike them dead upon the spot. 7 What great Commotions there remains, Some mourning for the loss of Friends, Others on Beds of racking Pains And groaning out expiring Pangs. 8 Others were drinking with the drunk Till all their active Powers were sunk, And some their idle Frolicks have, Yet all lead forward to the Grave, 9 But here among the rest I found A few that follow'd Christ the Lamb; With Heart and Hand they'd sign'd their names Chose him their Captain and their King. 10 I saw some poor convicted youths, Trembling at God's eternal Truths, With earnest Prayer they sought to God To wash them in Christ Jesus Blood. 11 I saw that little Company Surrounded with the Enemy, Satan was arm'd with all his Pow'r Their precious Souls for to devour. 12 But Christ the Mediator stood And plead before the Bar of God. 'Twas for these Souls whom Satan's bound I spilt my Blood upon the Ground. 13 Th'almighty Judge he sets them free From Satan's Chains of slavery. He takes them in the Arms of Love And makes them heirs of Heaven above. 14 But O I saw ten thousand run, Stupid as stocks they do go on In the broad Road that leads to Hell, Where tortured Souls in Torment dwell. 15 What precious Moments do they waste To please their sinful carnal Taste? Forgetful that their Souls must live Eternally beyond the Grave. 16 Here they on carnal things do feast Like dumb, like stupid thoughtless Beasts, And while on dainty Feasts they dine, Their precious Souls do strave within. 17 Alas the Soul that is worth more Than thousand World of Golden and Ore, When once 'tis lost and no Relief My Heart was filled with pain and Grief. 18 Trembling and sorrow seiz'd me round, In Prayer I fell upon the Ground. My Soul addrest God's holy Throne, To shower his blessed Spirit down. 19 Almighty God, make bare thine Arm, Jehovah sound the loud Alarm. Hell and Damnation is prepar'd For those that slight God's holy Word. 20 Shew Sinners their undone Estate; Their precious Souls now lie at stake; A few more sinful steps remains And they'r in everlasting Flames. 21 Arise dead Souls, and beg of God, To teach you how to read his Word, And change your Heart by power Divine That in your Heart may honor him AMEN</field>
