      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. POEMS. POETRY. I consider Poetry in a twofold view, as a spirit and a manifestation. Perhaps the poetic spirit has never been more justly defined, than by Byron in his Prophecy of Dante,—a creation “From overfeeling good or ill, an aim At an external life beyond our fate.” This spirit may be manifested by language, metrical or prose, by declamation, by musical sounds, by expression, by gesture, by motion, and by imitating forms, colors, and shades; so that literature, oratory, music, physiognomy, acting, and the arts of painting and sculpture, may all have their poetry; but that peculiar spirit, which alone gives the great life and charm to all the efforts of genius, is as distinct from the measure and rhyme of poetical composition, as from the scientific principles of drawing and perspective. The world is full of Poetry;—the air Is living with its spirit; and the waves Dance to the music of its melodies, And sparkle in its brightness. Earth is veiled, And mantled with its beauty; and the walls That close the universe with crystal in, Are eloquent with voices, that proclaim The unseen glories of immensity, In harmonies, too perfect, and too high, For aught but beings of celestial mould, And speak to man in one eternal hymn, Unfading beauty, and unyielding power. The year leads round the seasons, in a choir For ever charming, and for ever new, Blending the grand, the beautiful, the gay, The mournful, and the tender, in one strain, Which steals into the heart, like sounds that rise Far off, in moonlight evenings, on the shore Of the wide ocean resting after storms; Or tones that wind around the vaulted roof, And pointed arches, and retiring aisles Of some old, lonely minster, where the hand, Skilful, and moved with passionate love of art, Plays o'er the higher keys, and bears aloft The peal of bursting thunder, and then calls, By mellow touches, from the softer tubes, Voices of melting tenderness, that blend With pure and gentle musings, till the soul, Commingling with the melody, is borne, Rapt, and dissolved in ecstasy, to Heaven. 'T is not the chime and flow of words, that move In measured file, and metrical array; 'T is not the union of returning sounds, Nor all the pleasing artifice of rhyme, And quantity, and accent, that can give This all-pervading spirit to the ear, Or blend it with the movings of the soul. 'T is a mysterious feeling, which combines Man with the world around him, in a chain Woven of flowers, and dipped in sweetness, till He taste the high communion of his thoughts, With all existences, in earth and heaven, That meet him in the charm of grace and power. 'T is not the noisy babbler, who displays, In studied phrase, and ornate epithet, And rounded period, poor and vapid thoughts, Which peep from out the cumbrous ornaments That overload their littleness. Its words Are few, but deep and solemn; and they break Fresh from the fount of feeling, and are full Of all that passion, which, on Carmel, fired The holy prophet, when his lips were coals, His language winged with terror, as when bolts Leap from the brooding tempest, armed with wrath, Commissioned to affright us and destroy. Passion, when deep, is still,—the glaring eye That reads its enemy with glance of fire, The lip that curls and writhes in bitterness, The brow contracted, till its wrinkles hide The keen, fixed orbs that burn and flash below, The hand firm clenched and quivering, and the foot Planted in attitude to spring, and dart Its vengeance, are the language it employs. So the poetic feeling needs no words To give it utterance; but it swells, and glows, And revels in the ecstasies of soul, And sits at banquet with celestial forms, The beings of its own creation, fair, And lovely, as e'er haunted wood and wave, When earth was peopled, in its solitudes, With nymph and naiad,—mighty as the gods, Whose palace was Olympus, and the clouds That hung, in gold and flame, around its brow; Who bore, upon their features, all that grand And awful dignity of front, which bows The eye that gazes on the marble Jove, Who hurls, in wrath, his thunder, and the god, The image of a beauty so divine, So masculine, so artless, that we seem To share in his intensity of joy, When, sure as fate, the bounding arrow sped, And darted to the scaly monster's heart. This spirit is the breath of Nature, blown Over the sleeping forms of clay, who else Doze on through life in blank stupidity, Till by its blast, as by a touch of fire, They rouse to lofty purpose, and send out, In deeds of energy, the rage within. Its seat is deeper in the savage breast, Than in the man of cities; in the child, Than in maturer bosoms. Art may prune Its rank and wild luxuriance, and may train Its strong outbreakings, and its vehement gusts, To soft refinement, and amenity; But all its energy has vanished, all Its maddening and commanding spirit gone, And all its tender touches, and its tones Of soul-dissolving pathos, lost and hid Among the measured notes, that move as dead And heartless as the puppets in a show. Well I remember, in my boyish days, How deep the feeling when my eye looked forth On Nature, in her loveliness, and storms. How my heart gladdened, as the light of spring Came from the sun, with zephyrs, and with showers, Waking the earth to beauty, and the woods To music, and the atmosphere to blow, Sweetly and calmly, with its breath of balm. O, how I gazed upon the dazzling blue Of summer's Heaven of glory, and the waves, That rolled, in bending gold, o'er hill and plain; And on the tempest, when it issued forth, In folds of blackness, from the northern sky, And stood above the mountains, silent, dark, Frowning, and terrible; then sent abroad The lightning, as its herald, and the peal, That rolled in deep, deep volleys, round the hills, The warning of its coming, and the sound, That ushered in its elemental war! And, oh! I stood, in breathless longing fixed, Trembling, and yet not fearful, as the clouds Heaved their dark billows on the roaring winds, That sent, from mountain top, and bending wood, A long hoarse murmur, like the rush of waves, That burst, in foam and fury, on the shore. Nor less the swelling of my heart, when high Rose the blue arch of autumn, cloudless, pure As Nature, at her dawning, when she sprang Fresh from the hand that wrought her; where the eye Caught not a speck upon the soft serene, To stain its deep cerulean, but the cloud, That floated, like a lonely spirit, there, White as the snow of Zemla, or the foam That on the mid-sea tosses, cinctured round, In easy undulations, with a belt Woven of bright Apollo's golden hair. Nor, when that arch, in winter's clearest night, Mantled in ebon darkness, strewed with stars Its canopy, that seemed to swell, and swell The higher, as I gazed upon it, till, Sphere after sphere, evolving, on the height Of Heaven, the everlasting throne shone through, In glory's full effulgence, and a wave, Intensely bright, rolled, like a fountain, forth Beneath its sapphire pedestal, and streamed Down the long galaxy, a flood of snow, Bathing the heavens in light, the spring that gushed, In overflowing richness, from the breast Of all-maternal Nature. These I saw, And felt to madness; but my full heart gave No utterance to the ineffable within. Words were too weak; they were unknown; but still The feeling was most poignant: it has gone; And all the deepest flow of sounds, that e'er Poured, in a torrent fulness, from the tongue Rich with the wealth of ancient bards, and stored With all the patriarchs of British song Hallowed and rendered glorious, cannot tell Those feelings, which have died, to live no more. THE DESERTED WIFE. He comes not;—I have watched the moon go down, But yet he comes not. Once it was not so. He thinks not how these bitter tears do flow, The while he holds his riot in that town. Yet he will come, and chide, and I shall weep; And he will wake my infant from its sleep, To blend its feeble wailing with my tears. O, how I love a mother's watch to keep, Over those sleeping eyes, that smile, which cheers My heart, though sunk in sorrow, fixed and deep! I had a husband once, who loved me,—now, He ever wears a frown upon his brow, And feeds his passion on a wanton's lip, As bees, from laurel flowers, a poison sip; But yet I cannot hate.—O, there were hours When I could hang for ever on his eye, And Time, who stole with silent swiftness by, Strewed, as he hurried on, his path with flowers. I loved him then,—he loved me too. My heart Still finds its fondness kindle, if he smile; The memory of our loves will ne'er depart; And though he often sting me with a dart, Venomed and barbed, and waste upon the vile Caresses which his babe and mine should share, Though he should spurn me, I will calmly bear His madness,—and should sickness come, and lay Its paralyzing hand upon him, then I would with kindness all my wrongs repay, Until the penitent should weep, and say How injured, and how faithful, I had been. CONSUMPTION. There is a sweetness in woman's decay, When the light of beauty is fading away, When the bright enchantment of youth is gone, And the tint that glowed, and the eye that shone, And darted around its glance of power, And the lip that vied with the sweetest flower That ever in Pæstum's “Biferique rosaria Pæsti.”— Virg. garden blew, Or ever was steeped in fragrant dew,— When all that was bright and fair is fled, But the loveliness lingering round the dead. O, there is a sweetness in beauty's close, Like the perfume scenting the withered rose; For a nameless charm around her plays, And her eyes are kindled with hallowed rays, And a veil of spotless purity Has mantled her cheek with its heavenly dye, Like a cloud whereon the queen of night Has poured her softest tint of light; And there is a blending of white and blue, Where the purple blood is melting through The snow of her pale and tender cheek; And there are tones, that sweetly speak Of a spirit, who longs for a purer day, And is ready to wing her flight away. In the flush of youth and the spring of feeling, When life, like a sunny stream, is stealing Its silent steps through a flowery path, And all the endearments, that pleasure hath, Are poured from her full, o'erflowing horn, When the rose of enjoyment conceals no thorn, In her lightness of heart, to the cheery song The maiden may trip in the dance along, And think of the passing moment, that lies, Like a fairy dream, in her dazzled eyes, And yield to the present, that charms around With all that is lovely in sight and sound, Where a thousand pleasing phantoms flit, With the voice of mirth, and the burst of wit, And the music that steals to the bosom's core, And the heart in its fulness flowing o'er With a few big drops, that are soon repressed, For short is the stay of grief in her breast: In this enlivened and gladsome hour, The spirit may burn with a brighter power; But dearer the calm and quiet day, When the Heaven-sick soul is stealing away. And when her sun is low declining, And life wears out with no repining, And the whisper, that tells of early death, Is soft as the west-wind's balmy breath, When it comes at the hour of still repose, To sleep in the breast of the wooing rose; And the lip, that swelled with a living glow, Is pale as a curl of new-fallen snow; And her cheek, like the Parian stone, is fair, But the hectic spot that flushes there, When the tide of life, from its secret dwelling, In a sudden gush, is deeply swelling, And giving a tinge to her icy lips, Like the crimson rose's brightest tips, As richly red, and as transient too, As the clouds, in autumn's sky of blue, That seem like a host of glory met To honor the sun at his golden set: O, then, when the spirit is taking wing, How fondly her thoughts to her dear one cling, As if she would blend her soul with his In a deep and long imprinted kiss; So fondly the panting camel flies, Where the glassy vapor cheats his eyes, And the dove from the falcon seeks her nest, And the infant shrinks to its mother's breast. And though her dying voice be mute, Or faint as the tones of an unstrung lute, And though the glow from her cheek be fled, And her pale lips cold as the marble dead, Her eye still beams unwonted fires With a woman's love and a saint's desires, And her last fond, lingering look is given To the love she leaves, and then to Heaven, As if she would bear that love away To a purer world and a brighter day. THE CORAL GROVE. Deep in the wave is a coral grove, Where the purple mullet and gold-fish rove, Where the sea-flower spreads its leaves of blue, That never are wet with falling dew, But in bright and changeful beauty shine, Far down in the green and glassy brine. The floor is of sand like the mountain drift, And the pearl-shells spangle the flinty snow; From coral rocks the sea plants lift Their boughs, where the tides and billows flow; The water is calm and still below, For the winds and waves are absent there, And the sands are bright as the stars that glow In the motionless fields of upper air: There with its waving blade of green, The sea-flag streams through the silent water, And the crimson leaf of the dulse is seen To blush, like a banner bathed in slaughter: There with a light and easy motion, The fan-coral sweeps through the clear, deep sea; And the yellow and scarlet tufts of ocean Are bending like corn on the upland lea: And life, in rare and beautiful forms, Is sporting amid those bowers of stone, And is safe, when the wrathful spirit of storms, Has made the top of the wave his own: And when the ship from his fury flies, Where the myriad voices of ocean roar, When the wind-god frowns in the murky skies, And demons are waiting the wreck on shore; Then far below, in the peaceful sea, The purple mullet and gold-fish rove, Where the waters murmur tranquilly, Through the bending twigs of the coral grove. [I had found out a sweet green spot] I had found out a sweet green spot, Where a lily was blooming fair; The din of the city disturbed it not, But the spirit, that shades the quiet cot With its wings of love, was there. I found that lily's bloom, When the day was dark and chill; It smiled, like a star, in the misty gloom, And it sent abroad a soft perfume, Which is floating around me still. I sat by the lily's bell, And I watched it many a day; The leaves, that rose in a flowing swell, Grew faint and dim, then drooped and fell, And the flower had flown away. I looked where the leaves were laid, In withering paleness, by; And, as gloomy thoughts stole on me, said, There is many a sweet and blooming maid, Who will soon as dimly die. THE BROKEN HEART. He has gone to the land where the dead are still, And mute the song of gladness; He drank at the cup of grief his fill, And his life was a dream of madness; The victim of fancy's torturing spell, From hope to darkness driven, His agony was the rack of Hell, His joy the thrill of Heaven. He has gone to the land where the dead are cold, And thought will sting him—never; The tomb its darkest veil has rolled O'er all his faults for ever; O, there was a light that shone within The gloom that hung around him; His heart was formed to woo and win, But love had never crowned him. He has gone to the land where the dead may rest In a soft, unbroken slumber, Where the pulse, that swelled his anguished breast, Shall never his tortures number; Ah! little the reckless witlings know, How keenly throbbed and smarted That bosom, which burned with a brightest glow, Till crushed and broken-hearted. He longed to love, and a frown was all The cold and thoughtless gave him; He sprang to Ambition's trumpet-call, But back they rudely drave him: He glowed with a spirit pure and high, They called the feeling madness: And he wept for woe with a melting eye, 'T was weak and moody sadness. He sought, with an ardor full and keen, To rise to a noble station, But repulsed by the proud, the cold, the mean, He sunk in desperation; They called him away to Pleasure's bowers, But gave him a poisoned chalice, And from her alluring wreath of flowers They glanced the grin of malice. He felt that the charm of life was gone, That his hopes were chilled and blasted, That being wearily lingered on In sadness, while it lasted; He turned to the picture fancy drew, Which he thought would darken never; It fled;—to the damp, cold grave he flew And he sleeps with the dead for ever. TO SENECA LAKE. On thy fair bosom, silver lake! The wild swan spreads his snowy sail, And round his breast the ripples break, As down he bears before the gale. On thy fair bosom, waveless stream! The dipping paddle echoes far, And flashes in the moonlight gleam, And bright reflects the polar star. The waves along thy pebbly shore, As blows the north-wind, heave their foam, And curl around the dashing oar, As late the boatman hies him home. How sweet, at set of sun, to view Thy golden mirror spreading wide, And see the mist of mantling blue Float round the distant mountain's side. At midnight hour, as shines the moon, A sheet of silver spreads below, And swift she cuts, at highest noon, Light clouds, like wreaths of purest snow. On thy fair bosom, silver lake! O, I could ever sweep the oar, When early birds at morning wake, And evening tells us toil is o'er. [O, had I the wings of a swallow, I'd fly] O, had I the wings of a swallow, I'd fly Where the roses are blossoming all the year long, Where the landscape is always a feast to the eye, And the bills of the warblers are ever in song; O, then I would fly from the cold and the snow, And hie to the land of the orange and vine, And carol the winter away in the glow, That rolls o'er the ever green bowers of the line. Indeed, I should gloomily steal o'er the deep, Like the storm-loving petrel, that skims there, alone; I would take me a dear little martin to keep A sociable flight to the tropical zone: How cheerily, wing by wing, over the sea We would fly from the dark clouds of winter away, And for ever our song and our twitter should be, “To the land where the year is eternally gay.” We would nestle awhile in the jessamine bowers, And take up our lodge in the crown of the palm, And live, like the bee, on its fruits and its flowers, That always are flowing with honey and balm; And there we would stay, till the winter is o'er, And April is checkered with sunshine and rain,— O, then we would flit from that far-distant shore Over island and wave to our country again. How light we would skim, where the billows are rolled Through clusters that bend with the cane and the lime; And break on the beaches in surges of gold, When morning comes forth in her loveliest prime: We would touch for a while, as we traversed the ocean, At the islands that echoed to Waller and Moore, And winnow our wings with an easier motion Through the breath of the cedar that blows from the shore. And when we had rested our wings, and had fed On the sweetness that comes from the juniper groves, By the spirit of home and of infancy led, We would hurry again to the land of our loves; And when from the breast of the ocean would spring, Far off in the distance, that dear native shore, In the joy of our hearts we would cheerily sing, “No land is so lovely when winter is o'er.” RETROSPECTION. There are moments in life which are never forgot, Which brighten and brighten as time steals away; They give a new charm to the happiest lot, And they shine on the gloom of the loneliest day: These moments are hallowed by smiles and by tears; The first look of love, and the last parting given; As the sun, in the dawn of his glory, appears, And the cloud weeps and glows with the rainbow in heaven. There are hours, there are minutes, which memory brings, Like blossoms of Eden, to twine round the heart; And as time rushes by on the might of his wings, They may darken awhile, but they never depart: O, these hallowed remembrances cannot decay, But they come on the soul with a magical thrill; And in days that are darkest, they kindly will stay, And the heart, in its last throb, will beat with them still. They come, like the dawn in its loveliness, now, The same look of beauty, that shot to my soul; The snows of the mountain are bleached on her brow, And her eyes, in the blue of the firmament, roll: The roses are dim by her cheek's living bloom, And her coral lips part, like the opening of flowers; She moves through the air in a cloud of perfume, Like the wind from the blossoms of jessamine bowers. From her eye's melting azure there sparkles a flame, That kindled my young blood to ecstasy's glow; She speaks,—and the tones of her voice are the same As would once, like the wind-harp, in melody flow: That touch, as her hand meets and mingles with mine, Shoots along to my heart with electrical thrill; 'T was a moment for earth too supremely divine, And while life lasts, its sweetness shall cling to me still. We met,—and we drank from the crystalline well That flows from the fountain of science above; On the beauties of thought we would silently dwell, Till we looked—though we never were talking of love; We parted,—the tear glistened bright in her eye, And her melting hand shook, as I dropped it for ever; O, that moment will always be hovering by! Life may frown,—but its light shall abandon me—never. CALM AT SEA. The night is clear, The sky is fair, The wave is resting on the ocean; And far and near The silent air Just lifts the flag with faintest motion. There is no gale To fill the sail, No wind to heave the curling billow; The streamers droop, And trembling stoop, Like boughs, that crown the weeping willow. From off the shore Is heard the roar Of waves in softest motion rolling; The twinkling stars, And whispering airs, Are all to peace the heart controlling. The moon is bright, Her ring of light, In silver, pales the blue of heaven, Or tints with gold, Where lightly rolled, Like fleecy snow, the rack is driven. How calm and clear The silent air! How smooth and still the glassy ocean! While stars above Seem lamps of love, To light the temple of devotion. THE QUEEN OF FLOWERS. I am the light, fantastic queen of flowers; I call the wind-rose from its bed of snow, I pour upon the springing turf soft showers, I paint the buds of jasmine, when they blow, I give the violet leaf its tender blue, I dip its cup in night's unsullied tears, So that it shines with richer glances through, Like beauty heightened by a maiden's fears; Around the elm's green arch I freely twine The wooing tendrils of the clasping vine, And when the vernal air is fresh with dew, And the new sward with drops bedighted o'er, I lend the buttercup its golden hue, That glitters like a leaf of molten ore; I dress the lily in its veil of lawn Whiter than foam upon the crested wave, Pure as the spirit parted from its grave, When every stain that earth had left is gone, Shining beneath the mellow sun of May, Like pearls fresh-gathered from their glossy shells, Or tints that on the pigeon's plumage play, When filled with love his tender bosom swells; I throw Aurora o'er the cup of gold The tulip lifts to catch the tears of heaven, Gay as the cloud whose ever-changing fold Heralds the dawn, and proudly curtains even; I take the rainbow, as it glides away To mingle with the pure, unshaded sky, And, melting in one drop its bright array, I pour it in the crown-imperial's eye; I weave the silken fringe, that, as a vest, Mantles the fleur-de-lis in glossy down, I scatter gold spots on its open breast, And lift in slender points of blue its crown: I am the light, fantastic queen of flowers, My bed is in the bosom of a rose, And there I sweetly dream the moonlight hours, While vermeil curtains round my pillow close. THE SPIRIT OF THE AIR. I am the spirit of the viewless air, Upon the rolling clouds I plant my throne, I move serenely, when the fleet winds bear My palace in its flight, from zone to zone; High on the mountain top I sit alone, Shrouding behind a veil of night my form, And when the trumpet of assault has blown, Career upon the pinions of the storm; By me the gales of morning sweetly blow, Waving, along the bank, the bending flowers; 'T is at my touch the clouds dissolving flow, When flitting o'er the sky, in silent showers; I send the breeze to play among the bowers, And curl the light-green ripples on the lake; I call the sea-wind in the sultry hours, And all his train of gentle airs awake; I lead the zephyr on the dewy lawn To gather up the pearls that speck it o'er, And when the coolness of the night has gone, I send it where the willows crown the shore; I sit within the circle of the moon, When the fair planet smiles, and brightly throws Around the radiance of her clearest noon, Till every cloud that passes by her glows, When folds of fleecy vapor hang the sky, Borne on the night-wind through the silent air, And as they float, the stars seem rushing by, And the moon glides away in glory there; I lead the wild-fowl, when his untried wing Boldly ascends the vernal arch of blue, Before him on his airy path I fling A magic light, that safely guides him through; When lost in distant haze, I send his cry Floating in mellow tones along the wind, Then like a speck of light he hurries by, And hills, and woods, and lakes are left behind: When clouds are gathering, or when whirlwinds blow, When heaven is dark with storms, or brightly fair, Where'er the viewless waves of ether flow, Calm, or in tempest rolling, I am there. LIBERTY TO ATHENS. The flag of freedom floats once more Around the lofty Parthenon; It waves, as waved the palm of yore. In days departed long and gone; As bright a glory, from the skies, Pours down its light around those towers, And once again the Greeks arise, As in their country's noblest hours; Their swords are girt in virtue's cause, Minerva's sacred hill is free;— O, may she keep her equal laws, While man shall live, and time shall be! The pride of all her shrines went down; The Goth, the Frank, the Turk, had reft The laurel from her civic crown; Her helm by many a sword was cleft: She lay among her ruins low,— Where grew the palm, the cypress rose, And, crushed and bruised by many a blow, She cowered beneath her savage foes; But now again she springs from earth, Her loud, awakening trumpet speaks; She rises in a brighter birth, And sounds redemption to the Greeks. It is the classic jubilee;— Their servile years have rolled away; The clouds that hovered o'er them flee, They hail the dawn of freedom's day; From Heaven the golden light descends, The times of old are on the wing, And Glory there her pinion bends, And Beauty wakes a fairer spring;— The hills of Greece, her rocks, her waves, Are all in triumph's pomp arrayed; A light that points their tyrants' graves Plays round each bold Athenian's blade. The Parthenon, the sacred shrine Where Wisdom held her pure abode: The hill of Mars, where light divine Proclaimed the true, but unknown God; Where Justice held unyielding sway, And trampled all corruption down, And onward took her lofty way To reach at Truth's unfading crown: The rock, where Liberty was full, Where Eloquence her torrents rolled, And loud, against the despot's rule, A knell the patriot's fury tolled: The stage, whereon the drama spake, In tones that seemed the words of Heaven, Which made the wretch in terror shake, As by avenging furies driven: The groves and gardens, where the fire Of wisdom, as a fountain, burned, And every eye, that dared aspire To truth, has long in worship turned: The halls and porticoes, where trod The moral sage, severe, unstained, And where the intellectual God In all the light of science reigned: The schools, where rose in symmetry The simple, but majestic pile, Where marble threw its roughness by, To glow, to frown, to weep, to smile, Where colors made the canvas live, Where Music rolled her flood along, And all the charms that art can give Were blent with beauty, love, and song: The port, from whose capacious womb Her navies took their conquering road, The heralds of an awful doom To all, who would not kiss her rod: On these a dawn of glory springs, These trophies of her brightest fame; Away the long-chained city flings Her weeds, her shackles, and her shame; Again her ancient souls awake, Harmodius bares anew his sword; Her sons in wrath their fetters break, And Freedom is their only lord. THE GREEK EMIGRANT'S SONG. Now launch the boat upon the wave,— The wind is blowing off the shore,— I will not live, a cowering slave, In these polluted islands, more: Beyond the wild, dark-heaving sea, There is a better home for me! The wind is blowing off the shore, And out to sea the streamers fly,— My music is the dashing roar, My canopy the stainless sky,— It bends above so fair a blue, That Heaven seems opening on my view. I will not live a cowering slave, Though all the charms of life may shine Around me, and the land, the wave, And sky be drawn in tints divine;— Give lowering skies and rocks to me, If there my spirit can be free! Sweeter than spicy gales, that blow From orange-groves with wooing breath, The winds may from these islands flow,— But 't is an atmosphere of death; The lotus, which transformed the brave And haughty to a willing slave. Softer than Minder's winding stream, The wave may ripple on this coast; And brighter than the morning beam, In golden swell, be round it tost;— Give me a rude and stormy shore, So power can never threat me more! Brighter than all the tales they tell Of Eastern pomp and pageantry, Our sunset skies in glory swell, Hung round with glowing tapestry;— The horrors of a wintry storm Swell brighter o'er a freeman's form! The spring may here with autumn twine, And both combined may rule the year, And fresh-blown flowers and racy wine In frosted clusters still be near;— Dearer the wild and snowy hills, Where hale and ruddy Freedom smiles! Beyond the wild, dark-heaving sea, And ocean's stormy vastness o'er, There is a better home for me, A welcomer and dearer shore; There hands, and hearts, and souls, are twined, And free the man, and free the mind. ODE TO FREEDOM. Spirit of the days of old! Ere the generous heart grew cold; When the pulse of life was strong, And the breath of vengeance long; When, with jealous sense, the heart Felt the least indignant smart; When, alive at every pore, Honor no injustice bore, But, like lions on their prey, Sprang and washed the stain away; When the patriot's blood was shed At the shrine where valor bled; When the bard, with kindling song, Roused them to avenge their wrong; When the thought of insult, deep In the heart, could never sleep, But, though cherished many a day, Still at last it burst its way, Rolling with impetuous tide, Till the foeman crouched or died. Spirit of the days of yore! When the lofty hero bore, On his brow, and on his crest, Signs of thought, that could not rest; When the eager, active soul Spurned, and broke through all control, Nature was his only rule, Feeling taught his only school; When his vigorous frame was nursed, By no arts that poison cursed; When his heart was firm to will, And his hand was strong to kill; When he sternly struggled through All that he resolved to do; When he recked not if his path Smiled in peace, or frowned in wrath; When he started at the call Country gave, and left his all, Onward trod to front the foe, Nerved to deal the deadly blow; When the fight, to him, was play; When he cared not if his way Led to victory, or the grave,— Either fate becomes the brave: Days of strength gigantic! fled, Valor sleeps, and fame is dead. Spirit of the bold and free! Mountain breath of liberty; Parent of a hardy breed, Fiery as the Arab steed; Master of the mighty charm; Knitter of the brawny arm, Of the knee that cannot kneel, Heart of oak, and nerve of steel; Ruler of the craggy wild; On a throne of granite piled, Like a giant altar, thou Biddest all who love thee bow, Bend the neck, and fold the knee, To no conqueror but thee; In that hold thou bidst them wait, Till some proud, ambitious state, Marching in the pomp of war, Spread its flaunting banner far, And, with high and threatening breath, Call to slavery, or death; Then thou bidst them gird the brand, Plant the foot, and raise the hand, Draw the panting nostril wide, And, with stern and stately stride, Forward, like the eagle's wing, On the proud invader spring, And, in one resistless rush, All his power and splendor crush. Spirit of the great and good! Such as, in Athenæ, stood, Stern in justice, on the rock, Moveless at the people's shock, And when civil tempest raged, And intestine war was waged, With serene, but awful sway, Rolled the maddening tide away: Such as met at Pylæ's wall, Ere that glorious Freedom's fall,— When the life of Greece was young, Like the sun from ocean sprung, And the warm and lifted soul Marching onward to its goal: Such as at those holy gates, Bulwark of the banded states, With the hireling Persian strove, In the high and ardent love Souls that cannot stoop to shame Bear to Freedom's sacred name: Such as with the Saxon flew, Ever to their country true, From the rock, the wood, the fen, From the cavern and the den, Eager to the field of fight, Like a cloud that comes by night, Tore away, at once, the chain Fastened by the robber Dane, Drove him headlong from that shore, And embalmed his host in gore; Then secured their country's cause With a bond of equal laws, And bequeathed the sacred trust, When their bones should fall in dust, To that island race, who bear Light, and warmth, and glory, where Ocean's unchained billows roll From the mid-day to the pole; And to that more daring shoot, Bent with flowers and promised fruit, Who have dared, beyond the sea, To assert their liberty, Who, upon the forted hill, Braved a tyrant father's will, Down the bloody gauntlet threw, Grasped and snapped the links in two; And unshackled ventured forth, Noblest of the sons of earth. Spirit of the stirring blood, Rolling in an even flood Through the hale and ruddy cheek; Scorner of the pale and weak, Who in festering cities crawl, Victims of a sordid thrall, And for ever draw their breath, Lingering on the brink of death: But to thee the giant limb, Strong to leap, to run, to swim, Strong to guide the plough or brand, Guard, or free, or till their land; But to thee the godlike frame, Such as puts our dwarfs to shame, Firm, erect, and fair, as first Adam from his Maker burst, And exulting leaped to see His angelic symmetry; But to thee the eagle eye, Lifted to its parent sky, Drinking in the living stream, And again, with ardent beam, Sending all its fires abroad, Like the language of a god; But to thee the mighty brow, Fixed to dare, unused to bow, Now in placid kindness bright, Like a rock in evening's light, Then with anger's wrinkled frown, Gathered eyebrows lowering down, Awful as the storm whose fold Round a columned Alp is rolled; But to thee the mind of fire Toil can never damp or tire, Glancing, like a sunbeam, through Nature with a spirit's view, And from out its choicest store, In its fulness flowing o'er, Sending, like a bolt, the flow Of thought upon the crowd below. Healthful Spirit! at this hour There are haunts where thou hast power,— Haunts where thou shalt ever be, As thou ever hast been, free; Where the stream of life is led Stainless in its virgin bed, And its magic fire is still Blazing on its holy hill. There are mountains, there are storms, Where thou feed'st thy hives and swarms, Whence thou send'st them, to restore Virtue, where it dwells no more; Safe in those embattled rocks Life its native vigor locks, And its kindling energy Lives, and moves, and feels in thee; In those bulwarks is our trust, For the boundless power is just, Nor wilt thou from earth arise, Linked with justice, to the skies, But below, with mercy, dwell, Till the world shall hear its knell. LOVE OF STUDY. There are many youths, and some men, who most earnestly devote themselves to solitary studies, from the mere love of the pursuit. I have here attempted to give some of the causes of a devotion which appears so unaccountable to the stirring world. And wherefore does the student trim his lamp, And watch his lonely taper, when the stars Are holding their high festival in heaven, And worshipping around the midnight throne? And wherefore does he spend so patiently, In deep and voiceless thought, the blooming hours Of youth and joyance, when the blood is warm, And the heart full of buoyancy and fire? The sun is on the waters, and the air Breathes with a stirring energy; the plants Expand their leaves, and swell their buds, and blow, Wooing the eye, and stealing on the soul With perfume and with beauty. Life awakes; Its wings are waving, and its fins at play Glancing from out the streamlets, and the voice Of love and joy is warbled in the grove; And children sport upon the springing turf, With shouts of innocent glee, and youth is fired With a diviner passion, and the eye Speaks deeper meaning, and the cheek is filled, At every tender motion of the heart, With purer flushings; for the boundless power That rules all living creatures now has sway; In man refined to holiness, a flame That purifies the heart it feeds upon: And yet the searching spirit will not blend With this rejoicing, these attractive charms Of the glad season; but, at wisdom's shrine, Will draw pure draughts from her unfathomed well, And nurse the never-dying lamp, that burns Brighter and brighter on, as ages roll. He has his pleasures,—he has his reward: For there is in the company of books, The living souls of the departed sage, And bard, and hero,—there is in the roll Of eloquence and history, which speak The deeds of early and of better days,— In these, and in the visions that arise Sublime in midnight musings, and array Conceptions of the mighty and the good, There is an elevating influence, That snatches us awhile from earth, and lifts The spirit, in its strong aspirings, where Superior beings fill the court of heaven. And thus his fancy wanders, and has talk With high imaginings, and pictures out Communion with the worthies of old time: And then he listens, in his passionate dreams, To voices in the silent gloom of night, As of the blind Meonian, when he struck Wonder from out his harp-strings, and rolled on From rhapsody to rhapsody, deep sounds, That imitate the ocean's boundless roar; Or tones of horror, which the drama spake, Reverberated through the hollow mask, Like sounds which rend the sepulchres of kings, And tell of deeds of darkness, which the grave Would burst its marble portals to reveal; Or his, who latest in the holy cause Of freedom lifted to the heavens his voice, Commanding, and beseeching, and, with all The fervor of his spirit poured abroad, Urging the sluggish souls of self-made slaves To emulate their fathers, and be free; Or those which in the still and solemn shades Of Academus, from the wooing tongue Of Plato, charmed the youth, the man, the sage, Discoursing of the perfect and the pure, The beautiful and holy, till the sound That played around his eloquent lips became The honey of persuasion, and was heard As oracles amid Dodona's groves. With eye upturned, watching the many stars, And ear in deep attention fixed, he sits, Communing with himself, and with the world, The universe around him, and with all The beings of his memory and his hopes; Till past becomes reality, and joys, That beckon in the future, nearer draw, And ask fruition.—O, there is a pure, A hallowed feeling in these midnight dreams; They have the light of heaven around them, breathe The odor of its sanctity, and are Those moments taken from the sands of life, Where guilt makes no intrusion, but they bloom Like islands flowering on Arabia's wild. And there is pleasure in the utterance Of pleasant images in pleasant words, Melting like melody into the ear, And stealing on in one continual flow, Unruffled and unbroken. It is joy Ineffable to dwell upon the lines That register our feelings, and portray, In colors always fresh and ever new, Emotions that were sanctified, and loved, As something far too tender, and too pure, For forms so frail and fading. I have sat, In days when sensibility was young, And the heart beat responsive to the sight, The touch, and music of the lovely one,— Yes, I have sat entranced, enraptured, till The spirit would have utterance, and words Flowed full of hope, and love, and melody, The gushings of an overburdened heart Drunk with enchantment, bursting freely forth, Like fountains in the early days of spring. HEAVEN. The following effusion may serve to explain one of the mysteries of mythology,—the location of heaven above us. I had been sitting at a feast of souls, A banquet of pure spirits, where the thought Spoke on the eloquent tongue, and in the eye's Gay sparkle, and the ever-changing play Of feature, like the twinkling glance of waves Beneath the summer moonlight. I walked forth; It was a night in autumn, and the moon Was visible through clouds of opal, laced With gold and carmine,—such a silent night As fairies love to dance and revel in, When winds are hushed, and leaves are still, and waves Are sleeping on the waters, and the hum And stir of life reposing. There was spread Before my sight a smooth and glossy bay, Mirrored in silver brightness, and the chime Of rippling waters on its pebbles broke Alone the quietude that filled the air: But when the tremulous heaving of the deep, Far off, along its sandy barriers, rose And faintly echoed, as the fitful gust Ruffled the placid surface glassed below; Or at the call of night-birds, where they flew And sported in the sedges, low and sweet, Like swallows twittering, or the cooing voice Of ring-doves, when they brood their callow young. I looked abroad on sea and mountain, wild And cultured field, and garden, and they lay, Amid the stillness of the elements, Silent, and motionless, and beautiful, For mist and moonlight softened down their forms, And covered them with dim transparency, Like beauty melting through her Coan veil; A wind rose from the ocean, as it rolled Blue in the boundless distance, and it swept The curtained clouds athwart the moon, and gave The undimmed azure of the sky to light And full expansion. There my eyes were turned, And there they found the magic influence Which bound them, like enchantment, in a trance Of most exalted feeling, and the soul Was lifted from the body, and became A portion of the purity and light And loveliness of that cerulean dome: And it imagined on the mountain top, Now silvered with the milder beam of night, On the blue arch, and on the rolling moon, Careering through the host of stars, who seemed To worship at her coming, and put out The brightness of their twinkling when she moved Serenely and majestically by,— On these, and on the snowy clouds, that hung Their curtains round the border of the sky, Like folds of silken tapestry, it laid A world of tenderness and purity, The quiet habitation of the heart, The resting-place of those impassioned souls Who draw their inspiration at the founts Of nature, flowing from that theatre Whose scene is ever shifting with the play Of seasons, as the year steals swiftly on, And bears us, with its silent foot, away To dissolution; ardent souls, who love The rude rock, and the frowning precipice, The winding valley, where it lies in green Along the bubbling riv'let, and the plain, Parted in field and meadow, redolent Of roses in the flowery days of spring, And in the nights of autumn, of the breath Of frosted clusters, hung along the vines In blue and gushing festoons, in whose rind The drink of souls, the nectar of the gods, Ripens beneath the warm, unclouded sky. I looked upon this loveliness, until A dream came o'er me, and the firmament Was animate, and spirits filled the air, Floating on snowy wings, and rustled by, Fanning the wind to coolness; and they came On messages of kindness, and they sought The pillow of o'er-wearied toil, and shook The dews of Lethe from their dripping plumes Around his temples, till his mind forgot Its sad realities, and happy dreams Rose fair and sweet around him, and restored Awhile the spotless hours of infancy, When life is one enchantment! Then I seemed Rapt in a trance of ecstasy, and forms Stood thronging round supremely beautiful, Whose looks were full of tenderness, whose words Were glances, and whose melodies were smiles; Who uttered forth the feelings of the soul In that expressive dialect whose tones No tongue can syllable, the unseen chain Which links those hearts that beat in unison. It was that perfect meeting whither tend Our spirits in their better hours, and find The balm of wounded bosoms, where they dream The eye of mercy ever smiles, and peace For ever broods:—they call the vision Heaven. And thus hath man imagined he can find The region of his angels, and his gods, And blessed spirits, somewhere in the sky; Or in the moon, to which the Indian turns, And dreams it is a cool and quiet land, Where insect cannot sting, nor tiger prowl; Or on the cone of mountains, where the snow, Purest of all material things, is laid Upon a cloudy pillow, wreathed around The midway height, and parting from this world Olympus and the Swerga's holy bowers. A PICTURE. There is a fountain of the purest wave:— It ever floweth full and freshly on, Laughing beneath the fairest light of heaven, And chiming, like the tender voice of birds, Within a dewy thicket, when the morn Comes forth in beauty, and the winds awake To sip the moisture in the lily's bell. The spring is hidden in a silent cave, The shrine of darkness and of loneliness, And then it stealeth out to meet the sun, And shine beneath his brightness, and reveal The crystal of its purity, and play, In dove-like undulations, with the airs That gently come and kiss it, with a breath Perfumed among the roses, till they lend A sweetness to the waters, like the rills That spout from marble wells in Asian bowers. And where it cometh forth to meet the light, The rock is tapestried in mossy green, For ever freshening with the sprinkled dews, And always young in verdure, as when Spring Throws her new mantle o'er the turf, until The eye reposes on it, as a balm That, with its tender soothings, wins the heart To thoughts of purity and gentleness; For there is in the sight of fairy forms, And mellow tinctures, and dissolving shades,— And in the sound of rustling leaves, and waves, That murmur into slumber, and of birds Saluting, with their cheery notes, the dawn, And pouring out the loneliness of heart A rifled mother feels, when o'er her nest She sits and sees her young ones stolen away,— And in the scent of gardens, and young vines, And violet beds along the meadow brooks, There is a sweet attraction, which doth blend The spirit with the life of outward things, And it partaketh then in all the joy Of Nature, when she riseth from her sleep, And throweth out her vigor to the winds, And boundeth in her ecstasy, as fawns Leap in the very wantonness of heart, When life is all exuberance and fire. It floweth on embanked in freshest turf, Bending its margin low to meet the clear, Cool element, and slake its thirst therein, And bathe its roots, like silken threads, that play, Waving and streaming with the current's fall. Its flow is over pebbles and bright sands, Which, from the curling waters flashing out, Inlay the channel with mosaic, where The white flint shines like pearl, the agate glows With playful tints, dove-like or pavonine, Catching new splendor from the wave; the while Smooth-rounded stones, deep blue and ebony, And slaty flakes of red and russet-brown, Lie darker in their brightness, as when gems Sparkle from out the chilly night of caves. Above it elms and poplars,—trees that love The bank of meadow brooks: those with their limbs Light-arching in a platted canopy; These rising in a pyramid of boughs, And glancing with their many twinkling leaves, Bright in their varnished verdure, when they drink The pure light in their stillness; when at play, Checkered with freshest green and snowy down. Beside them willows droop to kiss the wave, That calmly crinkles by them, and they dip Their waving twigs, so that their silken leaves Ruffle the water to a circling curl, Widening and lessening to the turfy shore. From out its bosom islets lift their turfs Of alder and of sedges, where the wind Plays through the pointed blades, and murmuring lulls The dreamer, who reposes on the brink, And gazes on the ever-changing play Of bubble and of ripple, of light plumes Moving like pigmy vessels, as the breath Of summer fills their fan-like sail, and throws A sudden dimple o'er the mirrored stream. Flowers too are on its borders; flags in blue Carpet the hollow, roses on the knoll Open their clustered crimson, cardinals Lift, on the shady margin, spikes of fire, And one, Ranunculus fluitans. whose feathered stem, and starry bloom Of glossy yellow, wafted in the flow, Floats, like a sleeping Naiad, on the wave. MENTAL BEAUTY. “Bellezze .... Piu ch'n guisa mortal soavi e liete.”— Petrarca. Beauty has gone, but yet her mind is still As beautiful as ever; still the play Of light around her lips has every charm Of childhood in its freshness: Love has there Stamped his unfading impress, and the hues Of fancy shine around her, as the sun Gilds at his setting some decaying tower, With feathered moss and ivy overgrown. I knew her in the dawning of her charms, When the new rose first opened, and its sweets No wind had wasted. She was of those forms Apelles might have painted for the queen Of loveliness and love,—light as the fays Dancing on glimmering dew-drops, when the moon Rides in her silver softness, and the world Is calm and brightly beautiful below. She was all mildness, and the melting tone Of her sweet voice thrilled me, and seemed to flow Into my soul, a stream of melody, Delicious in its mellowness; it spake A heart at ease;—and then the quiet smile Sat playing on her lips, that, pouting, spread Their vermeil freshness forth, as if to ask The kiss of him she smiled on. In her eye Gentleness had its dwelling, and light Mirth Glanced out in sudden flashes, and keen Wit Shot arrows which delighted, while they stung. She was a young Medusa, ere she knew The evil of a world that watched to blast Her loveliness, and make it terrible; Striking a dead, cold horror on the heart Of him who saw the fairest of all things, A lovely woman, made the common prey Of lawless passion,—but it touched not HER: No mist breathed o'er her brightness; but the pure Full light of virtue rested there, and shed New lustre on the light that ever came Through her transparent features, and revealed Each movement of the soul that swelled within: And they were all of Heaven,—such high desires As angels had been proud of,—pure as light In its primeval fountain, ere it flowed To mingle with the elements, and lose Its perfect clearness. She was as a flower New opened in a valley, where no foot Had trodden, and no living thing had left Print of the world's pollution: there she blew Fragrant and lovely, and a parent's hand Shielded her from the winds that blast, or bring Poison upon their wings, and taint the heart Left open to their influence. Shielded there She ripened all her treasures, and became Full-blown and rich in her maturity,— The dwelling of a spirit not of earth, But ever mingling with the pure and high Conceptions of a soul that spreads its wings To fly where Mind, when boldest, dared to soar. And though the form has withered, and the bloom Has faded, she is lovely; for the sounds That issue from her lips, and flow around In liquid eloquence, are oracles Of more than ancient wisdom, or they speak Portions of that full hymn of Poesy, Which ever rises when a mind on fire Blends with the majesty of outward things; And with the glories of a boundless heaven, And a rich earth, and ever-rolling sea Communing, swells to that ineffable Fruition, which in hope will never end. MENTAL HARMONY. “Animæ dimidium meæ.”— Horat. We have had pleasant hours, but they are gone; And we shall never meet again, to spend Glad moments in the kindly intercourse Of blended thought and feeling; they are gone, Those festivals of fancy and of hope, Those May-days of the spirit, when the voice Of nature had a sweetness wholly new And most delightful to me, and the form And fashion of all creatures took a tint From the fair light within me; when we gave Days to such higher thoughts as lend to life A swifter pinion, that the flow of hours Be as the falling of a quiet stream, Whose current has no sound or sign to tell It hath an onward motion, and the sun Go to his setting, and we know it not, Time steals on such a silent wing away. There is a holy feeling in the trance Of thought; it is a calm and quiet sense Of purer being; we have known such hours, And they shall be remembered. Who would lose The memory of our blessings, and the light The recollection of departed days Of a serener pleasure, and a deep And happy friendship, tranquillized and raised To more exalted union, such as bound Two intellects in elder time, who loved To meet in fond endearment, and to lend In mutual talk their fullest thoughts,—the light Such recollection pours into the heart, Till we are circled with a hallowed sphere Of bright emotions,—who would lose, one day, Remembrances so gracious, for the wild, Mad tempest of ambition, or the gay And glittering dance of pleasure, or the pomp The rich man piles around him? I could walk, At the pale hour of twilight, on the path The willow-tree o'ershadows, by the brink Of a small run of water, and be wrapped In a deep loneliness, and yet find more That has in it an ecstasy, in thoughts Cast back upon the quick hours we have known In our long, woodland wanderings, and the sights That we have mutely gazed on, spread o'er hill, And plain, and sheeted ocean, than in all Hope ever promised to my ardent youth In the bright path of honor, or the way That winds through roses, sweetly leading on Its eager victim to the Bower of Love. Nature hath lent us, with a bounteous hand, Wherewith to make us happy, and if we Take not the kindly offer, 't is the fault Of our perverted hearts, which cannot find Beauty is what is open unto all. I have resolved within me, that the still And pure possession of my own free thoughts Surpasses earthly treasures, and is life Heightened to a superior essence; hence The wild woods are my chosen haunt, and there I read a fairer tome, a richer page, Than pen of man has traced with characters Of reason or of fancy. I become, In the society of untaught things, Drawn from my duller and my grosser sense, And lifted in my longings, and I learn How little there is great in the pursuit Of riches or of honor, how the mind, Let in the channel of heroic thought To flow in freedom onward, and pervade The purer regions of philosophy, And tasteful and impassioned poesy,— How mind alone is the true worth of man, And that which raises him above the sense Of meaner creatures, and permits a hope Of unembodied being, in a high And holy dwelling, lifted far above The reach of tempest, with essential light Encircled, and with fairest wings of love O'ershadowed, the reward and resting-place Of such as hold their journey patiently, And pause and faint not on their weary way. The recollection of one upward hour Hath more in it to tranquillize and cheer The darkness of despondency, than years Of gayety and pleasure. Then, alone We wander not in solitude, but find Friends in all things around us, for the heart Sinks not, and in its sinking bends the mind From its true lofty region, where it lives Rejoicing in bright energy; and so All things are open to the searching eye Of an unclouded intellect, and bring Their several treasures to it, and unfold Their fabric to its scrutiny. All life, And all inferior orders, in the waste Of being spread before us, are to him Who lives in meditation, and the search Of wisdom and of beauty, open books, Wherein he reads the Godhead, and the ways He works through his creation, and the links That fasten us to all things, with a sense Of fellowship and feeling, so that we Look not upon a cloud, or falling leaf, Or flower new blown, or human face divine, But we have caught new life, and wider thrown The door of reason open, and have stored In memory's secret chamber, for dark years Of age and weariness, the food of thought, And thus extended mind, and made it young, When the thin hair turns gray, and feeling dies. But this communion with inferior things Still leaves a void behind it, and we seek The kindred thoughts of other men, and bend Attentive o'er their written souls, wherein We see their better moments, when they cast The slough of earth aside, and tried a flight On an ascending pinion, and renewed Their purer being, as the insect bursts The walls that bound it in its second state,— It might be a gilded prison-house, But yet it was a prison: when its wing Unfolded, and it knew the bliss of air, And free and rapid motion, it had life, And floated as a spirit floats away, And wandered gayly on from flower to flower, And was so light and so ethereal, man Selected it the symbol of the soul, And its free flight through ether, on a wing That, moving through eternity, will ever Be active and unwearied, and as bright In its unruffled plumage, after years Have gathered into ages, and have gone Beyond the eldest memory of time. But yet the pen of Genius cannot cheer And heighten, like the spirit-speaking eye; And so we seek the living, and we find That there are spirits that commune with ours, As if they were our kindred, and were formed In the same mould; and when we meet with them, We cling with childlike fondness, as if life Had not a charm without them, and the sky With its ethereal beauty, and the earth Flowering or fading, and the fairest flow Of pure and tranquil waters, and the words Of the departed with their might of thought, Could be to us no solace, and have power To lend no high conception, nor subdue The spirit unto meekness; so we lean On an accordant bosom, and we love The beating of a heart that beats as ours, The speaking of an eye that tells us thoughts Which harmonize with what we feel, and all The light of beauty, passion, tenderness, And purity, and love of great, and fair, And fitly fashioned things, until we deem A sole existence is a wilderness, That yieldeth only terror, and a curse. We two have met a little while, and known How time may glide unnoticed, in the flow Of thoughts that have a sympathy; we part, But this shall be a token thou hast been A friend to him who traced these hurried lines, And gave them as a tribute to a friend, And a remembrance of the few kind hours Which lightened on the darkness of my path, And gave a pleasantness to some bright days, Bright in the light thou gavest them, and warmed Feelings, that sank in chilliness, and waked My fancy from its slumber, and thus drew One volume from its treasures, into day. RUINS. “Tempus edax rerum, tuque, invidiosa vetustas, Omnia destruitis.”— Ovid. Earth is a waste of ruins; so I deemed, When the broad sun was sinking in the sea Of sand, that rolled around Palmyra. Night Shared with the dying day a lonely sky, The canopy of regions void of life, And still as one interminable tomb. The shadows gathered on the desert, dark And darker, till alone one purple arch Marked the far place of setting. All above Was purely azure, for no moon in heaven Walked in her brightness, and with snowy light Softened the deep intensity, that gave Such awe unto the blue serenity Of the high throne of gods, the dwelling-place Of suns and stars, which are to us as gods, The fountains of existence and the seat Of all we dream of glory. Dim and vast The ruins stood around me,—temples, fanes, Where the bright sun was worshipped,—where they gave Homage to him who frowns in storms, and rolls The desert like an ocean,—where they bowed Unto the queen of beauty, she in heaven Who gives the night its loveliness, and smiles Serenely on the drifted waste, and lends A silver softness to the ridgy wave Where the dark Arab sojourns, and with tales Of love and beauty wears the tranquil night In poetry away, her light the while Falling upon him, as a spirit falls, Dove-like or curling down in flame, a star Sparkling amid his flowing locks, or dews That melt in gold, and steal into the heart, Making it one enthusiastic glow, As if the God were present, and his voice Spake on the eloquent lips that pour abroad A gush of inspiration,—bright as waves Swelling around Aurora's car, intense With passion as the fire that ever flows In fountains on the Caspian shore, and full As the wide-rolling majesty of Nile. Over these temples of an age of wild And dark belief, and yet magnificent In all that strikes the senses,—beautiful In the fair forms they knelt to, and the domes And pillars which upreared them,—full of life In their poetic festivals, when youth Gave loose to all its energy, in dance, And song, and every charm the fancy weaves In the soft twine of cultured speech, attuned In perfect concord to the full-toned lyre: When nations gathered to behold the pomp That issued from the hallowed shrine in choirs Of youths, who bounded to the minstrelsy Of tender voices, and all instruments Of ancient harmony, in solemn trains Bearing the votive offerings, flowing horns Of plenty wreathed with flowers, and gushing o'er With the ripe clusters of the purple vine, The violet of the fig, the scarlet flush Of granates peeping from the parted rind, The citron shining through its glossy leaves In burnished gold, the carmine veiled in down, Like mountain snow, on which the living stream Flowed from Astarte's minion, all that hang In Eastern gardens blended,—while the sheaf Nods with its loaded ears, and brimming bowls Foam with the kindling element, the joy Of banquet, and the nectar that inspires Man with the glories of a heightened power To feel the touch of beauty, and combine The scattered forms of elegance, till high Rises a magic vision, blending all That we have seen of glory, such as drew Assembled Greece to worship, when the form, Who gathered all its loveliness, arose Dewy and blushing from the parent foam, Than which her tint was fairer, and with hand That seemed of living marble parted back Her raven locks, and upward looked to Heaven, Smiling to see all Nature bright and calm;— Over these temples, whose long colonnades Are parted by the hand of time, and fall Pillar by pillar, block by block, and strew The ground in shapeless ruin, night descends Unmingled, and the many stars shoot through The gaps of broken walls, and glance between The shafts of tottering columns, marking out Obscurely, on the dark blue sky, the form Of Desolation, who hath made these piles Her home, and, sitting with her folded wings, Wraps in her dusty robe the skeletons Of a once countless multitude, whose toil Reared palaces and theatres, and brought All the fair forms of Grecian art to give Glory unto an island girt with sands As barren as the ocean, where the grave And stately Doric marked the solemn fane Where wisdom dwelt, and on the fairer shrine Of beauty sprang the light Ionian wreathed With a soft volute, whose simplicity Becomes the deity of loveliness, Who with her snowy mantle, and her zone Woven with all attractions, and her locks Flowing as Nature bade them flow, compels The sterner Powers to hang upon her smiles. And there the grand Corinthian lifted high Its flowery capital, to crown the porch Where sat the sovereign of their hierarchy, The monarch armed with terror, whose curled locks Shaded a brow of thought and firm resolve, Whose eye, deep sunk, shot out its central fires, To blast and wither all who dared confront The gaze of highest power; so sat their kings Enshrined in palaces, and when they came Thundering on their triumphal cars, all bright With diadem of gold, and purple robe Flashing with gems, before their rushing train Moving in serried columns fenced in steel, The herd of slaves obsequious sought the dust, And gazed not as the mystic pomp rolled by. Such were thy monarchs, Tadmor! now thy streets Are silent, and thy walls o'erthrown, no voice Speaks through the long, dim night of years, to tell These were once peopled dwellings; I could dream Some sorcerer in his moonlight wanderings reared These wonders in an hour of sport, to mock The stranger with the show of life, and send Thought through the mist of ages, in the search Of nations who are now no more, who lived Erst in the pride of empire, ruled and swayed Millions in their supremacy, and toiled To pile these monuments of wealth and skill, That here the wandering tribe might pitch its tents Securer in their empty courts, and we, Who have the sense of greatness, low might kneel To ancient mind, and gather from the torn And scattered fragments visions of the power, And splendor, and sublimity of old, Mocking the grandest canopy of heaven, And imaging the pomp of Gods below. THE VILLAGE GIRL. “Nature is fine in love; and where 't is fine, It sends some precious instance of itself After the thing it loves.”— Hamlet. I knew a pleasant village, in a lone And silent valley, on the southern side Of a long line of mountains, whence a brook Came gently down, and in its winding flow Stole through a pansied meadow, where a bank Of beeches lifted up its tufted slope To the warm sun of April, as it shone Tenderly from a hemisphere of blue, Purer because the earth sent rarer forth Its dimming exhalations, on whose boughs Yet hung the leaves of winter, with a low And plaintive rustling telling to the winds A sweet Æolian tale, and shining out In glossy twinkling, as they lightly turned Their surface to the light, and then veered back With a quick-glancing motion; in a bend Of that close thicket, where the mountain gust Came not, but all was tranquil, and the turf Was deeper greened, and the new opened flowers Spread bolder out their tender leaves, and sent Soft odors on the mellow air, that played Silently in that hollow, where the quail Sat often in the clear warm noon, and turned Her red eye to the silver light, and shook The dropped leaves in her playfulness; one day, When all was purely fair, and the chill winds Were hushed aloft, and as I upwards gazed, The frosted fir, the pendent pine, and all The sable groves of cedar, stood as still As when a wood of lances wait the breath Of the shrill horn and braying clarion, To sink upon the line of fight, and rush Forward to meet in conflict,—such a day, When the young sod first quickens, and the pale Blue eyes of weeping violets part their lids To drink the first warm rays, I chanced to bend My wandering foot along the grassy brink Of the calm-flowing brooklet, pleased to take With a quick eye its many turns, and dwell On the clear dashing of its waterfalls, And the soft gliding of its molten gold, Where the sun met it curving o'er a root That grew across its channel, or the curls, That like a pigeon's plumage waving played Over the sandy shallow, or the still And tranquil mirror where it rested deep And dark beneath a willow,—as I stood Looking aside upon the velvet vest Of the fresh-springing meadow, and above Where the bent birches hung their tufted flowers, New purpling like a silken shred, and faint The scarlet maple buds put out, and fair The downy willow catkins specked with gold Their flaxen locks, when life awoke within The leaf-buds of the forest, then I caught In that still nook a pale and lovely girl, With a fair hand fondling a petted lamb, That bounded light around her, and with long And oft-repeated fondness licked her hand, And then renewed its gambols, though it took Short turns, because a cord of braided blue, The color of a dove-wing, or the sky When a full moon shines over it, drew back Her minion to a narrow circle, for She thus had bound it in a silken chain, As if it were a loved one, who would fly To other lands, and leave her here to sing Her sad notes to the evening wind, and tell Her hours in weeping loneliness, and look Where the far path came o'er the hill to catch Her long departed lover, till the night Hid the low vale in darkness, and her eye Turned from the fruitless quest, and then she wept Tenderly, and her sweet voice took a tone In which despair was uttered, till it sunk Trembling and fainting, as the night-wind falls Softer along the harp-strings, till a sound Just whispers through the air, and all is still. There was a look of calmness in her thin And delicate features, wasted to a shade, Like a pure spirit musing on the dark And sad afflictions of this life below, And dwelling for a moment on the grief And sickness of the better few, who trust, In their most hopeless hours, they yet shall find A sunshine after darkness, and a calm After the tempest ceaseth, when the eye Of love shall rest for ever on the friends They late have seen departing on their long And unreturning journey, whose cold lids They closed with pious care, whose stiffened limbs They laid in decent order, and composed Their pale lips to a sweet and dying smile, And shrouded all in whitest lawn, than which No flaky snow falls purer, and no curl Catches a softer tincture from the moon, To throw a thin veil o'er the stars, and dim Their brightness to a faint and mellow ray, Like a lone taper through a curtain, when Sleep broods above the hamlet, and the sound Of life is hushed, and this alone reveals To him who walks in darkness that two hearts Are pouring out their fulness, or a voice, In the low, consecrated tone of prayer, Is talking with the Universal Soul, And blending with the perfect purity And majesty of Godhead, or an eye Is watching o'er the page of lofty thought, And catching inspiration at the shrine Of intellect and fancy, till the heart, Big with its high conceptions, overflows, And then his lips pour out the eloquence Of kindled spirit, and a purer stream Of language, musical, and grand, and full Of the quick life of mind, is sent abroad, Than ever meets the anxious ear, when crowds Drink in the rhetoric of master souls. Her looks were purely Grecian, such as charm Taste in an ancient statue, or a gem, Or fair intaglio, where a perfect white, Shaped to a nymph-like beauty, sparkles in A ground of azure;—it was such a face As had enamored Raphael, or inspired The pencil of Correggio to the birth Of a blue-eyed Madonna, or a calm And pensive spirit looking up to heaven, Poised on a seraph's wing high in the dome Of an Italian temple, where the God Of charity is worshipped, and the form Of Him who died on Calvary adored. Her brow was softly arched, and it was pure And pale as marble, and the dew of death Seemed resting there, and gave a fearful tint To its else perfect loveliness, and told Thoughts were at work beneath it, which might still Erelong the life within her, but are loved, Although we know them fatal, as we cling To the Circean bowl, and dying grasp At its alluring poison, which conveys A madness to the brain which hath a touch Of inspiration in its reveries, And spreads around the spirit light and calm, Till earth seems beautiful and life is heaven. Her hair was of a sunny brown, and fine As lines of light that stream across a cloud, Ere the sun rises, or the scarlet tuft, That floats beneath the green wave, where on rocks The sea-plume clings, and throws its feeling threads, Like flowing silk, around it. It was full, And dropped in light profusion down her neck, And o'er her bosom; and it parted lay In native ringlets round her brow, and shone Deeper beside the snow it rested on, And that came fairer through the curling shade That waved above it, as the sighing wind Sent a sweet-breathing air to shake the leaves, And crisp the sheeted water. As she hung Her head in deepest sorrow, some few tears Stole out and pearled her cheek, but these she brushed With a light touch aside, and then renewed A song, half sad, half playful, such as comes From a crazed brain, that says, it knows not why, A thousand things which are at first as gay As wild mirth in a revel, and then fall To a faint tone, in which despair alone Can have a concord, and at last a sob Closes it, and her glistening tears o'erflow. She lifted up her head, and mutely gazed Awhile upon the world above, and then Her ashy lips were moving, but no sound Came through their parting paleness; still it shone With a faint hectic flush, like the last tint The sun casts on a wreath of mists, and then A most intense cerulean veils it o'er, So that the sky seems tintless. As she looked Far in the silent atmosphere, methought Her blue eye had a fixedness, and saw A form distinctly featured, and she rose Half from her seat of turf, and threw her arms, As if to meet it in a fond embrace, And a sweet smile broke on her lips, and tears Stood glistening on her eyelids, such quick joy Stirred in her heart, and one faint word alone Escaped, it was Leoni:—then she dropped Suddenly on her grassy seat,—her head Drooped languidly, and her long flowing locks Showered their full ringlets o'er her, big round tears Dropped thick and freshly through them, and her sobs Shook her, they were so deep; she pressed her brow And wrung her hands, and then she cast them down Clasped on the sod beside her, shook her head, And with a sweet low voice sighed out, “No more.” She plucked the flowers that grew around, and kissed Their purple and their yellow leaves, and long Inhaled their perfume; then she opened wide Her lips to the wild laugh that tells despair, And it rang terribly around, and oft She uttered it still louder, and her eye Kindled and flashed intensely, and the spot Of death stood glowing like a ring of fire On the blue paleness of her cheek, and full The dark veins throbbed upon her brow, and shot Their branches o'er her temples, and she waved Her hand, that seemed a spirit's, where the light Shone with a purple glimmer through, and then She outward turned her palm, and often pushed Some hateful object from her, and a dark Mysterious look of madness glazed her eye, And her pearl teeth were set, and her frame shook With an internal shuddering; then with slow And broken sounds she muttered, “False and foul.” Suddenly she sank down, and, bending low, Hid her face in her mantle; one weak groan Stole from her, like a dying wind at eve Through a sere vine in autumn: then her lamb Drew to her side, and looked with wistful eye On her wild sorrow; as her dim eye caught The innocent eye that gazed so fondly, calm She lifted up her forehead, and composed Her scattered tresses, and held out her hand To the compassionate creature, who was now The only one she trusted in;—she smiled, As mourners smile, and, hanging o'er, she spake Few words of tenderness: “Thou wilt not leave, Fair face of gentleness, thou wilt not leave, Though the world leave me.” Then she gathered flowers And grass-blades, and she wove them in a wreath, And bound it round her minion's neck, and clasped Its soft limbs to her bosom, with a kiss Of sorrow and of love: her soul seemed calm, And shone serenely through her clear blue eyes, Which had in them a meek divinity, All patience and all hope, that as she gazed Upward to the pure vault and the bright sun, Methought her spirit parted, and took wing, And angels came to welcome it, and bear The weary stranger to a resting-place, And lay her on a pillow which no thorn Hath ever entered. Such a sacred calm Was printed in her look, that she became Sainted to all my feelings, and I stood To see her spurn the earth, and soar away To the pure air above the highest cone, That still looked white behind me; but she soon Rose gently from her seat, and threw her hair With a quick motion backward, closely drew Her russet cloak, and twined her braided line Around her marble fingers, then looked down, And said, “We must go homeward, sweet one, night Is coming in the far sky,” and ere I Could trace her, through the silent wood withdrew. A TALE. She had been touched with grief, and on her cheek Sorrow had left its impress in the pale Soft tint of fading loveliness. She bore Meekly the burden of her woes, and told To none the secret of heart. It preyed For ever on her life, and blanched away The roses which had bloomed so wooingly And freshly on her laughing lips. Her smile Grew fainter, and it only spread a line Of a most tender carmine, where the snow Scarce had a stain to mark it from the pure And perfect whiteness of her cheek and brow,— So pure, she seemed a living monument Of Parian marble; and the flaxen curls That waved around her forehead, and the arch Darker and brighter bent above that eye, Which through long lashes spoke in looks of fire, And was the only eloquence she used,— These, and at times a gushing to her cheek, Like the first flush of morning, or the faint, Fast-dying purple, when the twilight steals Into the depth of darkness,—these were all That told she yet was living, and was not An image of the Graces, or the shade Of a departed maiden, which at night Visits the silent walks she loved, and hangs Over the grave she watered, till she took Her last repose beside it. She had been The gayest and the loveliest, and had moved Through the light dance, and in the bending crowd Of young admirers, like an infant queen Proud of her innocent beauty. There was one Who looked, but spake not; and when others took Her hand to lead her through the merry hall In steps all grace and harmony, he stole Aside, and wept in anguish. He was made Not for the place of mirth, but for the still And peaceful shade of feeling, and of thoughts Which have their home in higher souls, and are Lone and unfriended and unknown below. His was a social nature; yet not made To blend with crowds, but find in one alone, One fairy minister of soft delights, And pure as they are tender, that deep joy Which none has ever uttered. Long he sought To win her to those calm retreats, and give To her a spirit kindred to his own, And lead her to the one and only love, The harmony of thought and wish and life, The union of all feelings, whence the deep, Exhaustless fountain of their blended hearts Flows ever deeper, and has ever more Of music in its flow, and more of light And beauty in its fulness. Thus he dwelt On her fresh loveliness, until his life Was linked unto her image, and her form Mingled with every thought, and every spot, Where the new spring looked beautiful, was filled With her pervading presence; but he dared Speak only to the mountain-winds her name, And only in a whisper. She had marked The silent youth, and with a beauty's eye Knew well she was beloved, and though her light And bounding spirit still was wild and gay, And sporting in the revel, yet her hours Of solitude were visited by him, Who looked with such deep passion. She too loved, And saw more in his melancholy eye, And in the delicate form, and the still look, And that high front of intellect, which crowned Features that were all tenderness and love, Like the fair shrine of poesy, where thoughts Dwelt high and solemn, such as from their seat Of glory visit none but the great few Whose language is immortal,—there she saw More that had charms to win her, than in all The light, unmeaning swarm, who fawned, and danced, And played their tricks in envious rivalry, Happy to draw from her one scornful smile. She loved him with a true and early love, And with her tenderness there was a sense Of awe, when on those magic eyes she gazed, Which seemed to look on spirits, not on men. Still, in her innocent cheerfulness, she sought To lead him from his solitary haunts, And throw bright smiles upon that shaded brow, And light that eye to rapture from its deep And mute abstraction. So she laughed and sung, And called him to the dance; but, with a gush Of feeling irresistible, he stole Aside and wept. Again he sought her ear, And told her his fond tale. First she looked cold, And o'er her forehead curled a playful frown; Then suddenly, and with a few light words, She scornfully turned from him, and enjoyed The moment of her triumph;—it was short, For with a firm, fixed look, in which were seen More thoughts of grief than anger, he drew back, And casting one proud farewell glance, that told There was no after hope, he turned away, And soon was gone, an exile, none knew where. He wandered to another land, and found New friends, who sought to cheer him; but a weight Hung on his heart, and would not be removed; The feeling of regret and injury, The love that will not perish, and the pride That quenches love, but does not make it hate; The fondness that will steal at times, and melt The heart to tears, and then the sudden pang Of long-remembered scorn, which freezes fast The fountain in its flow, and leaves the cold Dim glare of one whose only hope is death. He was in happy regions, and the sky Above him was most beautiful; its blue Was higher and intenser, and it took The spirit on a journey into heaven, And made it more than mortal: cool, soft gales Stole from a peaceful ocean, whose bright waves Rolled gently on to music, and they blew Through woven trellises of all-sweet flowers, And sported round long wreaths of festooned vines Hung with the gayest blossoms, and o'er beds That breathed in mellowest airs of balm and myrrh. Music was in those bowers, and Beauty there Crowded in mystic dances, and their nights Were consecrated to the skilful sounds Of a most witching harmony, to choirs Such as once moved in Athens to the voice Of flutes and timbrels. Many an eye was bent Full on the noble stranger, and they sought To win his smile; but yet he would not smile, For all his better thoughts were far away, And when he looked upon the lovely ones Around him, it recalled with keener sense Her who to him was lovelier, whom he loved, But would not in his bitterness forgive. When it was told her that the youth had fled, And fled in anger, then her look was changed, And never more her steps were in the dance, Nor were the cheerful sounds of her sweet voice Heard in the crowd of revellers. Alone She wept the folly which had thrown away The only treasure she had truly loved, And left her in the fairest of her days, The very spring-time of her loveliness, Only to think of what had been, and grieve. NIGHT WATCHING. She sat beside her lover, and her hand Rested upon his clay-cold forehead. Death Was calmly stealing o'er him, and his life Went out by silent flickerings, when his eye Woke up from its dim lethargy, and cast Bright looks of fondness on her. He was weak, Too weak to utter all his heart. His eye Was now his only language, and it spake How much he felt her kindness, and the love That sat, when all had fled, beside him. Night Was far upon its watches, and the voice Of Nature had no sound. The pure blue sky Was fair and lovely, and the many stars Looked down in tranquil beauty on an earth That smiled in sweetest summer. She looked out Through the raised window, and the sheeted bay Lay in a quiet sleep below, and shone With the pale beam of midnight;—all was still, And the white sail, that o'er the distant stream Moved with so slow a pace, it seemed at rest, Fixed in the glassy water, and with care Shunned the dark den of pestilence, and stole Fearfully from the tainted gale that breathed Softly along the crisping wave,—that sail Hung loosely on its yard, and, as it flapped, Caught moving undulations from the light, That silently came down, and gave the hills, And spires, and walls, and roofs, a tint so pale, Death seemed on all the landscape,—but so still, Who would have thought that anything but peace And beauty had a dwelling there! The world Had gone, and life was not within those walls, Only a few, who lingered faintly on, Waiting the moment of departure; or Sat tending at their pillows, with a love So strong it mastered fear,—and they were few, And she was one,—and in a lonely house, Far from all sight and sound of living thing, She watched the couch of him she loved, and drew Contagion from the lips that were to her Still beautiful as roses, though so pale They seemed like a thin snow-curl. All was still, And even so deeply hushed, the low, faint breath That trembling gasped away came through the night As a loud sound of awe. She passed her hand Over those quivering lips, that ever grew Paler and colder, as the only sign To tell her life still lingered;—it went out! And her heart sank within her, when the last Weak sigh of life was over, and the room Seemed like a vaulted sepulchre, so lone She dared not look around: and the light wind, That played among the leaves and flowers that grew Still freshly at her window, and waved back The curtain with a rustling sound, to her, In her intense abstraction, seemed the voice Of a departed spirit. Then she heard, At least in fancy heard, a whisper breathe Close at her ear, and tell her all was done, And her fond loves were ended. She had watched Until her love grew manly, and she checked The tears that came to flow, and nerved her heart To the last solemn duty. With a hand That trembled not, she closed the fallen lid, And pressed the lips, and gave them one long kiss;— Then decently spread over all a shroud; And sitting with a look of lingering love Intense in tearless passion, rose at length, And, pressing both her hands upon her brow, Gave loose to all her gushing grief in showers, Which, as a fountain sealed till it had swelled To its last fulness, now gave way and flowed In a deep stream of sorrow. She grew calm, And, parting back the curtains, looked abroad Upon the moonlight loveliness, all sunk In one unbroken silence, save the moan From the lone room of death, or the dull sound Of the slow-moving hearse. The homes of men Were now all desolate, and darkness there, And solitude and silence took their seat In the deserted streets, as if the wing Of a destroying angel had gone by, And blasted all existence, and had changed The gay, the busy, and the crowded mart To one cold, speechless city of the dead! PLEASURES OF CHILDHOOD. There is a middle place between the strong And vigorous intellect a Newton had, And the wild ravings of insanity; Where fancy sparkles with unwearied light, Where memory's scope is boundless, and the fire Of passion kindles to a wasting flame, But will is weak, and judgment void of power. Such was the place I held; the brighter part Shone out, and caught the wonder of the great In tender childhood, while the weaker half Had all the feebleness of infancy. A thousand wildering reveries led astray My better reason, and my unguarded soul Danced like a feather on the turbid sea Of its own wild and freakish fantasies. At times the historic page would catch my eye, And rivet down my thoughts on ancient times, And mix them with the demigods of old. Again I girt my loins to cross the waste Of burning Afric, and amid the wilds Of Abyssinia seek the modest springs Whence bubble out the waters of the Nile, The infancy of greatness;—how I loved To ascend the pyramids, and in their womb Gaze on the royal cenotaph, to sit Beneath thy ruined palaces and fanes, Balbec, or princely Tadmor, though the one Lurk like a hermit in the lonely vales Of Lebanon, and the waste wilderness Embrace the other!—scouring with the wind, I swept the desert on the Arab steed, Or with the panting camel flew away. There is an ecstasy in solitude, Amid the broken images of power, The serpent, owl, and jackal make their home, Or in the heart of ocean, or the sands Of Araby, or on the boundless plains Of central Asia, whence the savage Hun And Mogol in devouring torrents rushed. Armed with the rifle, tomahawk, and bow, How oft I wandered through the solemn woods And tangled morasses of Florida, Or where the wave of Mississippi pours Its yet unsullied current o'er the steep Of Antony, and winds among the hills Of velvet verdure silently and slow! The philosophic page was my delight, To trace the workings of a hand unseen, In earth, in air, and ocean, and the world Of wonders, which the canopy of night Discloses twinkling on its ebon arch. These were my pleasures, and the varied forms Of animal and plant, the bird, who cuts With gliding wing the liquid air, the fly, That flutters o'er its parent pool a day, The polished shells that pave the snowy bed Of ocean, with their many hues in soft Accordance blended, like the ancient floor Wrought in mosaic, or the sprig and flower, That smile in vale and meadow bathed in dew. These were at times my pleasures, but at times The childish part prevailed. Along the stream, That flowed in summer's mildness o'er its bed Of rounded pebbles, with its scanty wave Encircling many an islet, and its banks In bays and havens scooping, I would stray, And, dreaming, rear an empire on its shores. There cities rose, and palaces and towers Caught the first light of morning; there the fleet Lent all its snowy canvas to the wind, And bore with awful front against the foe; There armies marshalled their array, and joined In mimic slaughter; there the conquered fled,— I followed their retreat, until secure They found a refuge in their country's walls; The triumphs of the conqueror were mine, The bounds of empire widened, and the wealth Torn from the helpless hands of humbled foes: There many a childish hour was spent, the world, That moved and fretted round me, had no power To draw me from my musings, but the dream Enthralled me till it seemed reality; And when I woke, I wondered that a brook Was babbling by, and a few rods of soil, Covered with scant herbs, the arena where Cities and empires, fleets and armies, rose. VOYAGE OF LIFE. I launched my bark upon a waveless sea;— The morning glowed, the sun just risen shone In dazzling light along the glassy plain, That seemed a golden mirror, or, as oft A transient zephyr ruffled it, a flood Of molten amber. How the purple sail, And blue and crimson streamer wooed the wind. At times the bellying bosom of the sheet Received the rising gale, and onward bore The white and glittering prow, as through the wave It ploughed and heaved around the crested foam, Like snow-wreaths resting on a ground of gold. Again the rising zephyr died away, The boundless air was still, the canvas flapped And trembled on the yard, the streamers drooped, And fluttering waved around the masthead, sea And air were motionless: the crystal flood Opened its awful depths beneath,—so clear, The bark seemed hanging in the midway space Between the sky above and earth below: So still the elements, the briny drop, That trickled from the prow to meet the wave, Was heard distinctly, and the rippling shoal Of blue-finned mackerel, or the whispering flight Of the air-loving dweller of the deep, Fell on my ear and woke me from my dream. So passed the bark of life o'er childhood's sea, But youth came on, and blustering winds arose; Dark tempests gathered round, the howling blast Roared through the cordage, every sail was rent, The loosened helm gave way, and like the steed Maddened with luxury, that flies the rein And hurries on to ruin, so the bark Ran wild before the tempest; now it rose The billowy mountain, in the yawning gulf Now headlong plunged; the shriek was then unheard Amid the vaster tumult; then the night Of storms enwrapped me, by the bursting foam, The sparkling fire of ocean, or the flash, The harbinger of thunder, or the pale And baleful meteor of sickly green, That on the bowsprit led the way to death, Alone illumined. What a deafening roar From bursting billows, how the breaker's voice, Conflicting with the sea-beat crag, arose And bellowed through the gloom; the sea-dog there, Mounted above his danger, howled and bayed; The dying whale, dashed on the splintery rock, Groaned out his giant soul; the cormorant Flapped his black wings around my head; the loon, Perched on the topmast, sent his baleful scream, Like the mad moanings of a tortured man. So raged the storm around me, till a light, Dimly discovered through the darkness, showed Where help might yet be found; a secret hand Then seemed to grasp the rudder, o'er the waves The bark right onward held its steady course; The tempest seemed to mitigate its rage, The thunders ceased, the clouds spread out their veil In thinner folds, and through a transient break Sent a faint gleam of sunshine; from behind, A gentle wind blew steady; in the west The golden sky shone out, a larger curve Of brightness every instant opened, till The sun unveiled his face, and far away The tempest hurried o'er the mountain waves: It darkling flew, till on its bosom rose The many-colored bow; serenity Then filled the air, the white gull o'er me flew, And the blue halcyon came and on the wave Alighted, hid its head beneath its wing, And slept as on a pillow; still the sea Lifted its broad green back, and seemed to rock Its fury to repose; I neared the land, Blue hills first smiled, then sandy shores, like snow Bleached on the heavenward mountain, caught my eye, The lighthouse next, that with its warning fire Calls from the deep the wanderer to his home. The sun in cloudless majesty, as king Of nature, kindled ocean with his rays, And made the land more lovely; on I sailed, The haven spread its arms to call me in, And clasp me in its bosom; there I steered, And casting anchor, where no storm can rage, Nor tempest rock me, on the peaceful breast Of love eternal moored my bark for ever. A PICTURE. Scene.—The Valley of the Catskill River north of the Catskill Mountains. The glories of a clouded moonlit night,— An union of wild mountains, and dark storms Gathering around their summits, or in forms Majestic moving far away in light, Like pillared snow or spectres wreathed in flame. Meanwhile, around the distant peaks a flow Of moonlight settles, seeming from below, Above the mountain's rude, gigantic frame, An island of the heart, a home of bright, Unsullied souls, who, clad in purest white, Their bosoms stainless as their mantles, play Around the gilded rocks, and snowy lawns, And azure groves, in choirs like bounding fawns Around the throne of some imperial fay. Again the dark clouds brood below; their fold A moment shrouds the mountain in dun shade, Like midnight blackness from a crater rolled, And flashing, as the glimmering of a blade Amid the wreaths of war-smoke, lightnings quiver, And crackling bolts the oak's bent branches shiver, And rumbling echoes from the hollow glens Roar like the voice of lions in their dens, Awing the silent desert,—then the cloud, Careering on the whirlwind, lifts its shroud From off yon soaring pinnacle, and sweet, Soft moonlight there is sleeping, like the ray Whose flashes on a checkered fountain play Light as the twinkling glance of fairies' feet, Or brood in burnished brightness on the stream, Or kiss the tufted bank of dewy flowers, As if consoling, in his boyish dream, Her shepherd through her own still magic hours. Such is the brightness on those rocky towers; And rising in an arch of double height, Soaring away beyond that cone, the sky Smiles to the harmonizing touch of light, Like the blue iris of a joyous eye. The moon is there in glory, and the stars Shrink from her fuller splendor, and grow dim Behind the veil of her effulgence. Airs, As if from Eden breathing, blow; clouds swim, Foam-like and fleecy, round the landscape's brim; And, heaving like a storm-swoln billow's crest, Rolls the wild tempest in the darkened west, Its flashes twinkling through the gloom, its peals Bellowing amid the purple glens; the rain, Scudding along the forest, bears the bow Wreathed round the flying storm-cloud, as it steals Stiller and stiller through the night; the stain Of braided colors, in a softer glow, Bends o'er the foaming river its tall arch, As if the spirits of the air might march From mountain on to mountain, and look down, In triumph, from the pictured circle's crown, On hamlets wrapped in slumber, meadows green And gemmed with rain-drops, woods whose leaves are bowed With the dissolving richness of the cloud, And brown brooks flashing down the hills, and pouring Their tribute to the master stream, which wheels Through the rude valley, foaming, tumbling, roaring, And on the lonely wanderer, who steals Abroad in silence to that echoing shore, And, gazing on the mad wave, and the sky, Which arches o'er the universe on high, And on the flying cohorts of the storm Hiding their frowns behind a seraph's form, With soul subdued, and awed, enchanted eye Can only bow before them and adore. SPIRIT OF FREEDOM. Spirit of Freedom! who thy home hast made In wilds and wastes, where wealth has never trod, Nor bowed her coward head before her god, The sordid deity of fraudful trade; Where power has never reared his iron brow, And glared his glance of terror, nor has blown The maddening trump of battle, nor has flown His bloodthirst eagles; where no flatterers bow, And kiss the foot that spurns them; where no throne, Bright with the spoils from nations wrested, towers, The idol of a slavish mob, who herd Where largess feeds their sloth with golden showers, And thousands hang upon one tyrant's word. Spirit of Freedom! thou, who dwell'st alone, Unblenched, unyielding, on the storm-beat shore, And find'st a stirring music in its roar, And look'st abroad on earth and sea, thy own,— Far from the city's noxious hold, thy foot, Fleet as the wild deer, bounds, as if its breath Were but the rankest, foulest steam of death, Its soil were but the dunghill, where the root Of every poisonous weed and baleful tree Grew vigorously and deeply, till their shade Had choked and killed each wholesome plant, and laid In rottenness the flower of Liberty. Thou fliest to the desert, and its sands Become thy welcome shelter, where the pure Wind gives its freshness to thy roving bands, And languid weakness finds its only cure; Where few their wants, and bounded their desires, And life all spring and action, they display Man's boldest flights, and highest, warmest fires, And beauty wears her loveliest array. Thou climb'st the mountain's crag, and with the snows Dwell'st high above the slothful plains; the rock Thy iron bed; the avalanche's shock Thou sternly breastest: hunger, cold, and toil Harden thy steeled nerves, till the frozen soil, The gnarled oak, the torrent, as it flows In thunder down its gulf, are not more rude, More hardy, more resistless, than thy force, When, waked to madness in thy headlong course, Thou rushest from thy wintry solitude, And sweepest frighted nations on thy path, A whirlwind in the fury of thy wrath, And, with one curl of thy indignant frown, Castest the pride of plumed warriors down, And bear'st them onward, like the storm-filled wave, In mingled ruin to their bloody grave. Spirit of Freedom! I would with thee dwell, Whether on Afric's sand, or Norway's crags, Or Kansa's prairies, for thou lov'st them well, And there thy boldest daring never flags; Or I would launch with thee upon the deep, And like the petrel make the wave my home, And careless as the sportive sea-bird roam; Or with the chamois on the Alp would leap, And feel myself, upon the snow-clad height, A portion of that undimmed flow of light No mist nor cloud can darken. O, with thee, Spirit of Freedom! deserts, mountains, storms, Would wear a glow of beauty, and their forms Would soften into loveliness, and be Dearest of earth, for there my soul is free. HOME. There is a spot, a quiet spot, which blooms On earth's cold, heartless desert. It hath power To give a sweetness to the darkest hour, As in the starless midnight from the rose, Now dipped in dew, a sweeter perfume flows; And suddenly the wanderer's heart assumes New courage, and he keeps his course along, Cheering the darkness with a whispered song: At every step a purer, fresher air Salutes him, and the winds of morning bear Soft odors from the violet beds and vines; And thus he wanders, till the dawning shines Above the misty mountains, and a hue Of vermeil blushes on the cloudless blue, Like health disporting on the downy cheek. It is time's fairest moment: as a dove Shading the earth with azure wings of love, The sky broods o'er us, and the cool winds speak The peace of nature, and the waters fall, From leap to leap, more sweetly musical, And from the cloudy bosom of the vale Come, on the dripping pinions of the gale, The simple melody of early birds Wooing their mates to love, the low of herds, And the faint bleating of the new-born lambs, Pursuing, with light, bounding step, their dams; Again the shepherd's whistle, and the bark That shrilly answers to his call; and hark! As o'er the trees the golden rays appear, Bursts the last joyous song of chanticleer, Who moves in stately pomp before his train, Till, from his emerald neck, and burnished wings, The playful light a dazzling beauty flings, As if the stars had lit their fires again. So sweetly to the wanderer o'er the plain, The rose, the jessamine, and every flower That spreads its leaflets in the dewy hour, And catches in its bell, night's viewless rain, In tempered balm their rich aroma shower; And with this charm the morning on his eye Looks from her portals in the eastern sky, And throws her blushes o'er the sleeping earth, And wakes it to a fresh and lovely birth. O, such a charm adorns that fairest spot, Where noise and revelry disturb me not, But all the spirits that console me come, And o'er me spread a peaceful canopy, And stand with messages of kindness by, And one sweet dove, with eyes that look me blessed, Sits brooding all my treasures in her nest, Without one slightest wish the world to roam, Or leave me, and that quiet dwelling,—home. LOVE AT EVENING. It was the hour of moonlight, and the bells Had rung their curfew tones, and they were still; The echo died around the distant hill, Sinking in faint and fainter falls and swells, Accordant with the fitful wind, that blew Over the new-mown meadow, where the dew Stood twinkling on the closely shaven stems, Glittering as 't were a carpet sown with gems; And from the winding river there arose A mist, that curled in volumed folds, and gave A snowy mantle to the stealing wave, Like that which fancy, love-enchanted, throws Over the form it doats on with a feeling Of most endeared fondness, blind to all That is not light and loveliness, concealing The tints of weakness with a darkest pall: And as the moon descending on the cloud Gives it a rainbow livery, and hues All softness and all beauty, so imbues The fond eye of affection with all charms The image of its awe: and he is proud, Ay, prouder than the proudest, when his arms Around that form of loveliness are flung, And when those melting eyes are on him hung, And when those lips are moving in sweet tones, That tell, whate'er the words be, that she owns No other for her love; and then the sigh Struggles within her bosom, and her eye Is wet with rising tears, and then the smile Plays sweetly on her parting lips awhile, And then she hangs upon his arm, and tells, Her heart how happy,—and that fond heart swells To give its feelings utterance, and she sings Sweetly, as when the lark at morning springs From out a dewy thicket, and away Winnows his easy flight to meet the day; And thus their eyes are blended, and they gaze A moment on each other, and then turn To where the countless fires of ether burn, And look from heaven with soft and soothing rays; A moment with uplifted brow they pour The swelling current of devotion o'er, And then, descending from that upward flight, Again their eyes in tender looks unite, Again they speak in understones, as still As are the winds that rustle on the hill, Then side by side, in links of fondness prest, Steal silently unto their hallowed rest. [Silent she stood before me, in the light] Silent she stood before me, in the light And majesty of beauty; and her eye Was teeming with the visions of her soul;— She stood before me in a veil of white, The image of her bosom's purity, And loveliness enveloped her, as bright As when, at set of sun, the clouds unroll, Pavilioning the dusky throne of night. There is a spirit in the kindling glance Of pure and lofty beauty, which doth quell Each darker passion; and as heroes fell Before the terror of Minerva's lance, So beauty, armed with virtue, bows the soul With a commanding, but a sweet control, Making the heart all holiness and love, And lifting it to worlds that shine above, Until, subdued, we humbly bend before The idol of our worship to adore. [Star of the pensive! “melancholy star,”] Star of the pensive! “melancholy star,” That, from the bosom of the deep ascending, Shines on the curling waves, like mourner bending Over the ruins of the joys that were; Or lone, deserted mother sweetly tending Her hushed babe in its cradle, often blending Her plaintive song and sigh repressed,—sweet star! I love the eye that looks on me so far From all this want, and wretchedness, and woe, From out that home of pure serenity Above the winds and clouds. When tempests blow, The sailor through the darkness looks to thee;— Thou art the star of love, and fond hearts gaze With feeling awe upon thy trembling rays, And dream that other eyes are resting there; And O what light around the bosom plays, When, dwelling on the beautiful and fair, We think that eyes beloved those beauties share! [“O, there is a bliss in tears!”—in tears that flow] “O, there is a bliss in tears!”—in tears that flow From out a heart where tender feelings dwell, That heaveth with involuntary swell Of joy or grief for others' weal or woe. The highest pleasures fortune can bestow, The proudest deeds that victory can tell, The charms that beauty weaveth in her spell, These holy, happy tears how far below! Yes, I would steal me from life's gaudy show, And seek a covert in a silent shade, And where the cheating lights of being glow, See glory after glory dimly fade, And knowing all my brighter visions o'er, Deep in my bosom's core my sorrows lay, And thence the fountains of repentance pour, Gush after gush, in purer streams away. VAUCLUSE. The laurel throws its locks around thy grave, As freshly as when erst thou lingered there, And plucked the early flowers to crown thy hair, Or gathered cresses from the glassy wave, That winds through hills of olive, vine, and grain, Stealing away from Vaucluse' lonely dell, Now murmuring scantily, now in the swell Of April foaming onward to the plain,— Laura! Thy consecrated bough is bright, As when thy Petrarch tuned his soft lute by, And lit his torch in that dissolving light, Which darted from his only sun,—thine eye; Thy leaf is still as green, thy flower as gay, Thy berry of as deep a tint, as when Thou moved a goddess in the walks of men, And o'er thy poet held unbounded sway. Methinks I hear, as from the hills descend The deepening shadows and the blue smoke curls, And waving forests with the light winds bend, And flows the brook in softer leaps and whirls,— Methinks I hear that voice of love complaining, In faint and broken accents, of his hours Of lonely sorrow, and of thy disdaining And half-averted glances, till the bowers Are pregnant with the hymn, and every rose With fresher dew, as if in weeping, flows, And every lily seems to wear a hue Of paler tenderness, and deeper glows The pink's carnation, and a purer blue Melts on the modest rosemary, the wind Whispers a sweeter echo, and the stream Spouts stiller from its well; while from behind The snow-clad alpine summits rolls the moon, Careering onward to her cloudless noon, In fullest orb of silver, and her beam Casts o'er the vale long shadows from the pine, The rock, the spire, the castle, and away, Beyond thy towers, Avignon! proudly shine The broad Rhone's foaming channels, in their play Through green and willowed islands, while they sweep, Descending on their bold, resistless way, And heaving high their crest in wild array, With all a torrent's grandeur, to the deep. LIGHT OF LOVE. Fair as the first-blown rose, but oh! as fleeting, Soft as the down upon a cygnet's breast, Sweet as the air, when gales and flowers are meeting, Bright as the jewel on a sultan's vest, Dear as the infant smiling when caressed, Mild as the wind, at dawn in April, blowing, Calm as the innocent heart, and oh! as blest, Pure as the spring from mountain granite flowing, Gay as the tulip in its starred bed glowing, As clouds that curtain round the west at even, O'er earth a canopy of glory throwing, And heralding the radiant path to heaven. Sweet as the sound, when waves, in calm, retreating, Roll back, in gurgling ripples, from the shore, When in the curling well still waters meeting, Clear, from the spout, the molten crystal pour; Sweet as at distance heard the cascade's roar, Or ocean on the lone rock faintly dashing, Or dying thunders, when the storm is o'er, And dim-seen lightnings far away are flashing; Sweet as when spring is garlanding the trees, The birds in all the flush of life are singing, And as the light leaves twinkle in the breeze, The woods with melody and joy are ringing, When beds of mint and flowering fields of clover Are redolent of nature's balmiest store, And the cool wind, from rivers, hurries over And gathers sweets that Hybla never bore. Fair as the cloudless moon o'er night presiding, When earth, and sea, and air are hushed and still, Along the burning dome of nature riding, Crowning with liquid lustre rock and hill, Pencilling with her silver beam the rill That o'er the wave-worn marble falling plays, Sheeting with light the cascade at the mill, And paving ocean with her tremulous rays, Through the closed lids of dewy violets stealing, And gemming, with clear drops, the mead and grove; Such is the light the native heart of feeling Throws round the stainless object of his love. FLOWER OF A SOUTHERN GARDEN. Flower of a Southern garden newly blowing, Fair as a lily bending on its stem, Whose curled and yellow locks, in ringlets flowing, Need not the lustre of a diadem; Than all the wealth of Ind, a brighter gem; Than all the pearls, that bud in Oman's sea, Than all the corals waving over them, Purer the living light that circles thee; And through thy tender cheek's transparency The vermeil tint of life is lightly flushing, Or, at the faintest touch of modesty, In one deep crimson tide is wildly rushing; Like rose-leaves, when the morning's breath is brushing Away the seeds of pearl the night-cloud shed, So thy twin opening lips are purely blushing, Ripe with the softest dew and clearest red; Purer than crystal in its virgin bed, Than fountains bubbling in a granite cave, Than sheeted snow, that wraps a mountain's head, Or lilies glancing through a stainless wave, Purer the snow that mantles o'er thy breast, And rests upon thy forehead;—O, with thee The hours might flit away so sweetly blest, That time would melt into eternity! Go with me to the desert loneliness Of forest and of mountain,—we will share The joys, that only purify and bless, And make a paradise of feeling there; And daily thou shalt be more sweet and fair, And still shalt take a more celestial hue, Like spirits melting in the midway air, Till lost and blended in the arch of blue: Alone, not lonely, we will wander through Thickets of blooming shrubs and mantling vines, Happy as bees amid the summer dew, Or song-birds, when the fresh spring morning shines; And when departing life shall wing its flight, And render back the gift which God has given, Be then to me a seraph form of light, And bear my fleeting soul away to Heaven. ROSE OF MY HEART. Rose of my heart! I've raised for thee a bower, For thee have bent the pliant osier round, For thee have carpeted with turf the ground, And trained a canopy to shield thy flower, So that the warmest sun can have no power To dry the dew from off thy leaf, and pale Thy living carmine, but a woven veil Of full-green vines shall guard from heat and shower. Rose of my heart! here, in this dim alcove, No worm shall nestle, and no wandering bee Shall suck thy sweets, no blight shall wither thee, But thou shalt show the freshest hue of love. Like the red stream, that from Adonis flowed, And made the snow carnation, thou shalt blush, And fays shall wander from their bright abode To flit enchanted round thy loaded bush. Bowed with thy fragrant burden, thou shalt bend Thy slender twigs and thorny branches low: Vermilion and the purest foam shall blend; These shall be pale, and those in youth's first glow: Their tints shall form one sweetest harmony, And on some leaves the damask shall prevail, Whose colors melt, like the soft symphony Of flutes and voices in the distant dale. The bosom of that flower shall be as white, As hearts that love, and love alone, are pure, Its tip shall blush, as beautiful and bright As are the gayest streaks of dawning light, Or rubies set within a brimming ewer. Rose of my heart! there thou shalt ever bloom, Safe in the shelter of my perfect love, And when they lay thee in the dark, cold tomb, I'll find thee out a better bower above. CATANIA. Catania! on thy famed and classic shore I long to plant my foot, and stand between A paradise, all blooming, gay, and green, And thy earth-circled ocean's gentle roar, Along whose peaceful waves the sunbeams pour, From stainless skies, deep amber, and imbue The ruffled waters with an iris hue, Like torchlight sparkling in a vault of ore,— And turning I behold thy fields of grain Waving in yellow floods o'er vale and plain, And meadows mantled in a waste of flowers, And hills whereon the golden orange glows, And purpling with the ripe vine's nectared bowers, And breathing with the myrtle and the rose; And higher still flame-crested Ætna towering, A belt of giant oak and chestnut waves In gloomy verdure, like the cypress lowering With shade of solemn night o'er Eastern graves; And loftier, in its virgin robe of white, The snow-cap, pillowed on the cloudless sky, Seems like a floating column of pure light, And round its pointed cone dark volumes lie Rolled from the volcan's jaws, and sheets of flame Dart on their path to heaven, and flowing o'er The glowing torrent rolls its flashing stream, And from the mountain's womb comes forth a sullen roar. SONNETS. [I. I stand upon the mountains, 'mid a sea] I stand upon the mountains, 'mid a sea Of rocks, and woods, and waters, vales and plains, Where smiling Freedom clad in russet reigns, Beneath a cloudless, deep-blue canopy, Whereon, in sovereign pomp and majesty, The lord of day ascends his noontide throne, And looks o'er all, himself unviewed alone, Such is the burning brightness of his eye; And here with upward breast and daring wing, And glance that dwells undazzled on the blaze, And finds its home in those unclouded rays, From off these rocky battlements I spring, And soaring to a more ethereal height, My pinions lift me on to heaven's own world of light. [II. Monarch of mountains! whose serenest brow] Monarch of mountains! whose serenest brow, O'er clouds and storms uplifted, courts the sky, And gazes on the all-pervading eye, To which, in heartfelt awe, wide nations bow, As Him from whom their life and being flow,— Monarch of mountains! at thy feet I lay The tribute of my wonder, and there pay The homage of a soul, to whom the bow Of glory, that encircles thee when night Comes on in iris-splendor, and thy height Glows with unnumbered hues and seems on fire, And o'er thy pure snows rolls a wave of light,— To whom these glories are a high delight, An inspiration, and a deep desire, And would be heaven, could I but hear an angel's lyre. [III. My country,—at the sound of that dear name] My country,—at the sound of that dear name The wanderer's heart awakens, nerved and bold Before him stand the deeds and days of old, The tombs of ages, and the rolls of fame Sculptured on columns, where the living flame Of Freedom lights anew its fading ray, And glows in emulation of that day, When on their foes they stamped the brand of shame: Yes, at the thought of these bright trophies leaps The spirit in his bosom, and he turns His longing eye to where his parent sleeps, And high on rocks his country's beacon burns; And though the world be gayest, and sweet forms Of love and beauty call him, he would fly, And walk delighted in her mountain storms, And man his soul with valor at her cry, And in the fiercest shock of battle die. [IV. Now to my task:—be firm,—the work requires] Now to my task:—be firm,—the work requires Cool reason, deep reflection,—and the glow Of heart, that pours itself in restless flow, Must sleep, and fancy quench her beaming fires, And all my longings, hopes, and wild desires Must seek their slumberous pillow and be still; But energy must mantle o'er my will, And give the patient toil that never tires: For Nature stands before me, and invites My spirit to her sanctuary, and draws Aside her pictured veil, from where she writes In living letters her eternal laws; And as I stand amid the countless wheels, That roll the car of being on its way, A deep serene my silent bosom feels, I seem a portion of the viewless ray, And o'er me flows the light of pure, unfading day. [V. Come forth, fair waters, from the classic spring] Come forth, fair waters, from the classic spring, And let me quaff your nectar, that my soul May lift itself upon a bolder wing, And spurn awhile this being's base control. How many a cup of inspiration stole The bards from out thy sparkling well, and sung Strains high, and worthy of the kindling bowl, Till all Aonia and Hesperia rung! And on the green isles of the ocean sprung A wilder race of minstrels, like the storm Which beats their rocky bulwarks; there they strung A louder harp, and showed a prouder form; And sending o'er the sea their song, our shore Shall catch the sound, and silent sleep no more. [VI. Farewell, sad flowers, that on a desert blow] Farewell, sad flowers, that on a desert blow, Farewell! I plucked you from the Muses' bower, And wove you in a garland, which an hour Might on my aching eye enchantment throw. Your leaves are pale and withered, and your flow Of perfume wasted, your alluring power Has vanished like the fleeting April shower,— Too lovely flowers to spread your leaves below. Sweet flowers! though withered, all the joy I know Is when I breathe your balm, your wreath intwine; And earth can only this delight bestow, That sometimes all your loveliness is mine; And then my frozen heart awhile will glow, And life have moments, in its path, divine! [VII. Would I were but a spirit, veiled in light] Would I were but a spirit, veiled in light, Wafted by winds of heaven from flower to flower, Catching, from bending blades, the crystal shower, When earth, impearled, awakened new and bright; Would I were set to guide some rolling sphere, Amid the glories of eternal day, Hymning aloud a sweet, celestial lay That immortality alone can hear; Would I were but the messenger of love, To bear from soul to kindred soul the sigh, To kiss the tears that fall from beauty's eye, And watch the ringdove in the lonely grove; Then sounds of melody might ever flow From lips that with the fire of feeling glow. AN ODE TO MUSIC. ?????? ??? ???, ??????, ??????? ?????? ???????. Iliad, B. 484. I. Descend, and with thy breath inspire my soul; Descend, and o'er my lyre Diffuse thy living fire; O, bid its chords a strain of grandeur roll! Touched by thy hand their trembling accents ring; Borne on thy sounding pinions through the sky, To Heaven the notes in burning ardor spring, And as the tones in softened whispers die, Love seems to flutter round on his Aurora-wing. II. O Muse! who erst in Tempe's flowery vale Wert wont to tune thy harp and breathe thy soul, And o'er Peneus pour thy dying wail; Who, when loud-roaring thunders rocked the pole, Burst from the dell and 'mid the growling storm Involved in lurid gloom thy shining form; And while the tempest o'er Olympus frowned, And lightnings glittered round the throne of Jove, Thy lyre, with hurried notes and awful sound, Seemed like the voice that rung through dark Dodona's grove. III. Reclined amid the woods that waved around Castalia's crystal fount and murmuring stream, While ever-blooming flowerets decked the ground, And brightened in the summer's softened beam, Thy virgins nine, with lyres of burnished gold, Around thy sylvan throne their descant rolled, And through the mountain glen, the pensive shade, A mellow echo would the strain prolong, And as around the hollow cliffs it played, A thousand heavenly harps seemed answering to the song. IV. Urania o'er her star-bespangled lyre With touch of majesty diffused her soul; A thousand tones, that in the breast inspire Exalted feelings, o'er the wires 'gan roll;— She sang of night, that clothed the infant world, In strains as solemn as its dark profound,— How at the call of Jove the mist unfurled, And o'er the swelling vault, the glowing sky, The new-born stars hung out their lamps on high, And rolled their mighty orbs to music's sweetest sound. V. Majestic Clio touched her silver wire, And through time's lengthened vista moved a train, In dignity sublime;—the patriot's fire Kindled its torch in heaven's resplendent ray, And 'mid contention rose to heaven again. In brightness glowing like the orb of day The warrior drove his chariot o'er the slain, And dyed its wheels in gore;—the battle's yell, The dying groan, the shout of victory, Now like the tempest-gust in horror swell, Now like the sighing breeze in silence melt away. VI. But when Erato brushed her flowery lute, What strains of sweetness whispered in the wind! Soft as at evening when the shepherd's flute, To tones of melting love alone resigned, Breathes through the windings of the silent vale, Complaining accents tremble on the gale, Or notes of ecstasy serenely roll. So when the smiling Muse of Cupid sung, Her melody sighed out the sorrowing soul, Or o'er her silken chords sweet notes of gladness rung. VII. But O Melpomene! thy lyre of woe, To what a mournful pitch its keys were strung, And when thou bads't its tones of sorrow flow! Each weeping Muse, enamored, o'er thee hung: How sweet, how heavenly sweet, when faintly rose The song of grief, and at its dying close The soul seemed melting in the trembling breast; The eye in dews of pity flowed away, And every heart, by sorrow's load opprest, To infant softness sunk, as breathed thy mournful lay. VIII. But when, Calliope, thy loud harp rang, In Epic grandeur rose the lofty strain; The clash of arms, the trumpet's awful clang Mixed with the roar of conflict on the plain; The ardent warrior bade his coursers wheel, Trampling in dust the feeble and the brave, Destruction flashed upon his glittering steel, While round his brow encrimsoned laurels waved, And o'er him shrilly shrieked the demon of the grave. IX. Euterpe glanced her fingers o'er her lute, And lightly waked it to a cheerful strain Then laid it by, and took the mellow flute, Whose softly flowing warble filled the plain: It was a lay that roused the drooping soul, And bade the tear of sorrow cease to flow; From shady woods the nymphs enchanted stole, While laughing Cupids bent the silver bow, Fluttering like fays that flit in Luna's softened glow. X. The rage of Pindar filled the sounding air, As Polyhymnia tried her skill divine; The shaggy lion roused him from his lair, And bade his blood-stained eyes in fury shine; The famished eagle poised his waving wings, Whetting his thirsty beak,—while Murder rose, With hand that grasps a dirk, with eye that glows In gloomy madness o'er the throne of kings, And, as she bade her tones of horror swell, The demon shook his steel with wild exulting yell. XI. How light the strain when, decked in vernal bloom, Thalia tuned her lyre of melody, And when Terpsichore, with iris-plume, Bade o'er her lute her rosy fingers fly; 'T was pleasure all:—the fawns in mingled choirs, Glanced on the willing nymphs their wanton fires, Joy shook his glittering pinions as he flew; The shout of rapture and the song of bliss, The sportive titter and the melting kiss, All blended with the smile, that shone like early dew. XII. Their music ceased,—and rising from thy throne, Thou took'st thy harp that on the laurel hung, And bending o'er its chords to try their tone, A faintly trembling murmur o'er them rung: At each sweet sound that broke upon the ear, Started the listening throng, and gazed and smiled; The satyr, leaning on his ivy spear, Peeped forth delighted from the flowery wild, And, while thou tunedst the keys, the raptured soul Hung o'er the flying tones that on the zephyrs stole. XIII. This prelude o'er, a solemn strain arose, As strayed thy fingers slowly o'er the wire; How grand the diapason,—and its close, As when to heaven the organ notes aspire, And through the gloomy aisle, the lofty nave, Swell out the anthem pealing o'er the grave! Low muttering thunders seemed to roar around, And rising whirlwinds whispered in the ear; The warrior started at the solemn sound, Half drew his sword, and slowly shook his spear; The tiger couched, and gazed with burning eye, In horror growled, and lashed his waving tail; The serpent rustled like the dying gale, And bade his tongue in purple ardor fly, Quivering like lurid flames beneath the midnight sky. XIV. The fury of the storm is howling by, The whirlwinds rush, the bursting thunders roll, Grim horror settles o'er the lowering sky, And ruin flashes on the shuddering soul: So burst with sudden swell thy awful strain, And every blast of war was on the gale; The maddening warriors mingled on the plain, Loud rose the yell, and rang the clanging mail; The victor's dripping chariot crushed the slain; The raging tiger with terrific roar Sprang on his prey, and dyed his claws in gore; Rising on spires that shone with varied hue,— Bright crimson, burnished gold, and livid blue,— The serpent, hissing in his burning ire, Glanced on his flying foe, and fixed his tooth of fire. XV. Struck by thy bounding quill, a mellow lay Rang o'er the harp, and softly died away: As poured the descant in the warrior's ear, The roar of conflict ceased along the plain, The foes exulting trampled on the slain, And shook in mingled dance the glimmering spear; In listless ease reclined, the tiger lay, And fondly sported with his bleeding prey; At times the serpent waved his quivering tail, Then coiled his folds, and, all to peace resigned, Listened the strain that sported in the wind, And hissed his pleasure, shrill as sounds the infant's wail. XVI. At last a murmur trembled on the lyre, Soft as the dirge that echoes o'er the bier: Robbed of his spirit bold, his daring fire, The vanquished warrior dropped a tender tear, Leant on his bloody sword and breathed a sigh; And as the tiger spread his claws of gold, Fawned round thy form and purred his ecstasy, His emerald eyes in languid softness rolled; The serpent, falling gently from his spire, Glided with easy sweep along the plain, In graceful windings wantoned round thy lyre, And kissed the trembling chord that breathed the soothing strain. THE JUDGMENT. Hark! the Judgment trump has blown! How it rolls along the air! Time and Hope for ever flown, Sinners for your doom prepare. Slowly o'er the lurid sky Rolls a dark, terrific storm, Showing to the startled eye On its skirts a giant form. Hark! the rattling hail descends, See! the forky lightnings glow, As that form in anger bends, Frowning on the world below. Riding on the whirlwind's wing, Canopied in clouds he flies; With his voice the mountains ring, With his presence glow the skies. Earthquakes roar and rock the ground, Tyrants bow before his rod, Nations tremble at the sound, When they hear the voice of God. Lo! the God! He comes in wrath: Vengeance drives his iron car, Lightnings pave his flaming path, As he hurries to the war. “I have waited long and spared Ingrates, on my bounty fed;— Now my red right arm is bared, Now your day of hope is fled. “I have bid my sun to shine, I have bid my dews to fall, I have sent my love divine,— You have spurned and wasted all. “Now the day of trial o'er, I my fatal shaft let fly; Mercy can endure no more,— Time must end and you must die.” Ripe with sin the harvest bends;— See the mighty reaper stand! There his burning scythe he sends, And with fury sweeps the land. See the fields and forests glow! See the mounting flame aspire! Hark the sinner's yell of woe, Gasping in a world of fire! Helpless wretches! whither fly? In what den a shelter find? See! the blasting bolt is nigh, Flame before, and wrath behind. Like the chaff by whirlwinds driven, Like the earthquake-shattered rock, Like the oak by tempest riven, Torn and splintered with the shock; So they fly, a quivering throng, Urged by shame, despair, and fear; Hurried by the sword along, Flashing, falling on their rear. Hear the crackling whirlwind roar; Sheets of flame ascend the sky; Now the feeble cry is o'er, Quenched in dark eternity. Now the hills and mountains melt, Rocks in flashing torrents run, To earth's heart the rage is felt,— Now the work of wrath is done. Curling like a lettered scroll, Crisped and crackling in the flame, Now heaven's vaulted arches roll; Falls the universal frame. Now the circling blue has fled, Suns wax faint and stars grow dim, Heaven and earth away have sped, Time's last trump their dying hymn. Matter now has ceased to be, All is pure ethereal light; Saints, from all that bound them free, To the empyrean wing their flight. In that fount their beings blend, All their thoughts, their views, the same; See creation's essence end In one flood of viewless flame! A TRIBUTE TO THE BRAVE. Though furled be the banner of blood on the plain, And rusted the sabre once crimsoned with gore; Though hushed be the ravens that croaked o'er the slain, And calmed into silence the battle's loud roar; Though Peace with her rosy smile gladden the vales, And Commerce unshackled dance over the wave;— Though music and song may enliven the gales, And Joy crown with roses and myrtle the brave; Like spirits that start from the sleep of the dead, Our heroes shall rouse, when the larum shall blow; Then Freedom's broad flag on the wind shall be spread, And Valor's sword flash in the face of the foe. Our Eagle shall rise 'mid the whirlwinds of war, And dart through the dun-cloud of battle his eye,— Shall spread his wide wings on the tempest afar O'er spirits of valor that conquer or die. And ne'er shall the rage of the conflict be o'er, And ne'er shall the warm blood of life cease to flow, And still 'mid the smoke of the battle shall soar Our Eagle—till scattered and fled be the foe. When Peace shall disarm War's dark brow of its frown, And roses shall bloom on the soldier's rude grave,— Then Honor shall weave of the laurel a crown, That Beauty shall bind on the brow of the brave. THE SENATE OF CALLIMACHI. So it was written in the first accounts of the Peloponnesian Senate. The true name is Calamata. I prefer the name in the text. It has in it an omen: ???? ????, “glorious victory.” AN ODE. In Callimachi's halls are met The chieftains of a noble line; The fathers' spirit lingers yet, To aid them in their high design; The spirit that, in ancient days, Called forth the boldest Spartan band, With their own shields and breasts to raise A living bulwark round their land. The sound that erst in Hellas rang, When War his brazen trumpet blew, When shields returned the hollow clang, And ready feet to battle flew,— That sound in Sparta's vale is raised; The Turkish bar and bolt are riven; The fire that erst on Œta blazed, In bolder eddies curls to heaven. That flame o'er Spartan valor burned, The brave three-hundred's funeral pyre! Though now in Grecian earth inurned, Their fame shall Grecian hearts inspire; It blazes on the sacred rock, It flashes o'er the hallowed glen; Advance, ye Greeks! and breast the shock, And show the world ye still are men. The sons of sires, who knew no fear When threatening foemen scaled their walls, The light shall see, the sound shall hear, And throng to Callimachi's halls: The altar of their country burns; They pledge their oath to liberty; Their fathers answer from their urns, “Be like us, sons, and ye are free.” On old Messene's soil are met The sons of Aristomenes; Your ancient wrongs and feuds forget In wrongs so foul, so deep, as these: A new Aristodemus flings His iron gauntlet on the foe; At once, a nation's valor springs To deal the liberating blow. Who would not glow in such a cause? Who not exult in such a name? Blest be the sword each Maynote draws To lop away his bonds and shame: The fire is kindled in his soul; The spirit flashes in his eye; A nation's blended voices roll The vow of freedom to the sky. Leap from your tombs, ye men who stood At Pylæ and at Marathon; The sire shall find his boiling blood Throb in the bosom of his son: Haste, demigods! with shield and spear, And hover o'er the coming fight; O, let the rocks of Sparta hear The gathering word, “Unite! unite!” A PLATONIC BACCHANAL SONG. Fill high the bowl of life for me,— Let roses mantle round its brim, While heart is warm and thought is free, Ere beauty's light is waning dim,— Fill high with brightest draughts of soul, And let it flow with feeling o'er, And love, the sparkling cup, he stole From heaven, to give it briskness, pour. O, fill the bowl of life for me, And wreathe its dripping brim with flowers, And I will drink, as lightly flee Our early, unreturning hours. Fill high the bowl of life with wine, That swelled the grape of Eden's grove, Ere human life, in its decline, Had strewed with thorns the path of love,— Fill high from virtue's crystal fount, That springs beneath the throne of Heaven, And sparkles brightly o'er the mount From which our fallen souls were driven. O, fill the bowl of life with wine, The wine that charmed the gods above, And round its brim a garland twine, That blossomed in the bower of love. Fill high the bowl of life with spirit, Drawn from the living sun of soul, And let the wing of genius bear it, Deep-glowing, like a kindled coal,— Fill high from that ethereal treasure, And let me quaff the flowing fire, And know awhile the boundless pleasure That Heaven-lit fancy can inspire. O, fill the bowl of life with spirit, And give it brimming o'er to me, And as I quaff, I seem to inherit The glow of immortality. Fill high the bowl of life with thought From that unfathomable well, Which sages long and long have sought To sound, but none its depths can tell,— Fill high from that dark, stainless wave, Which mounts and flows for ever on, And rising proudly o'er the grave, There finds its noblest course begun. O, fill the bowl of life with thought, And I will drink the bumper up, And find, whate'er my wish had sought. In that the purest, sweetest cup. [Here's to her who wore] Here's to her who wore The myrtle-wreath that bound me; Here 's to her who bore The twine of bay that crowned me:— O, had not her light So brightly shone upon me, Still the cloud of night Had darkly brooded on me; There was in her eye A spirit that inspired me; Still to do or die, The electric sparkle fired me; And though the ice of death Should chill the heart within me, The music of her breath Back to life again would win me; So here 's to her who wore The myrtle-wreath that bound me; The girl who kindly bore The twine of bay that crowned me. No more the iron chain Of doubt and fear inthralls me; I lift my wing again, For 't is her voice that calls me; Still higher, higher still, In search of glory soaring, I feel my bosom thrill To the song her voice is pouring; And though I stretch my flight, Where heaven alone is o'er me, I see her form of light Still floating on before me: O, when foes the direst move In columns to assail us, Let us hear the voice of love, And our courage cannot fail us: So here 's to her, &amp;c. And when my drowsy soul A heedless moment slumbers, Away the vapors roll At the magic of her numbers; Back to life again I start, At her thrilling summons waking, Every link that bound my heart Down to earth, indignant breaking; Then I follow where she flies, Like a shooting star, before me, And her fascinating eyes Shed their fire in flashes o'er me: O, cold the heart could sleep When her silver trumpet called it, And the soul that would not leap When her flowery chain enthralled it: So here 's to her who wore The myrtle-wreath that bound me; The girl who kindly bore The twine of bay that crowned me. DITHYRAMBIC. Fill the cup for me, Fill the cup of pleasure; Wake the fairy lyre To its wildest measure. Melancholy's gloom Now is stealing on me, But the cup and lyre Can chase the demon from me. Fill the cup for me, Fill the cup of pleasure; Wake the fairy lyre To its wildest measure. In the shades of night, When every eye is closing, On the moonlight bank All in peace reposing, There is naught so sweet As the cup of pleasure, And the lyre that breathes In its wildest measure. Fill the cup, &amp;c. This the smiling star That guides me o'er life's ocean, This the heavenly light That wakes my heart's devotion: 'T is when Beauty's smile Gives the cup of pleasure, And awakes the lyre To its wildest measure. Fill the cup, &amp;c. If the fiend of sorrow With his gloom affright thee, There may come to-morrow One who will delight thee: 'T is the fair, whose smile Beams with sweetest pleasure, And whose hand awakes The lyre's delightful measure. Fill the cup, &amp;c. Form of Beauty! bind Pleasure's wreath of roses Round this brow of mine, Where every joy reposes: Yes, my heart can bound To mirth's enlivening measure, When the lyre is tuned, And smiles the cup of Pleasure. Fill the cup, &amp;c. Drive dull care away,— Why should gloom depress thee? Life may frown to-day, But joy will soon caress thee. While there 's time, my friend, Drink the cup of Pleasure, And awake the lyre To its wildest measure. Fill the cup for me, Fill the cup of Pleasure, Wake the fairy lyre To its wildest measure. THE SERENADE. Softly the moonlight Is shed on the lake, Cool is the summer night,— Wake! O awake! Faintly the curfew Is heard from afar, List ye! O list! To the lively guitar. Trees cast a mellow shade Over the vale, Sweetly the serenade Breathes in the gale, Softly and tenderly Over the lake, Gayly and cheerily,— Wake! O awake! See the light pinnace Draws nigh to the shore, Swiftly it glides At the heave of the oar, Cheerily plays On its buoyant car, Nearer and nearer, The lively guitar. Now the wind rises And ruffles the pine, Ripples foam-crested Like diamonds shine, They flash, where the waters The white pebbles lave, In the wake of the moon, As it crosses the wave. Bounding from billow To billow, the boat Like a wild swan is seen On the waters to float; And the light dripping oars Bear it smoothly along In time to the air Of the gondolier's song. And high on the stern Stands the young and the brave, As love-led he crosses The star-spangled wave, And blends with the murmur Of water and grove The tones of the night, That are sacred to love. His gold-hilted sword At his bright belt is hung, His mantle of silk On his shoulder is flung, And high waves the feather, That dances and plays On his cap where the buckle And rosary blaze. The maid from her lattice Looks down on the lake, To see the foam sparkle, The bright billow break, And to hear in his boat, Where he shines like a star, Her lover so tenderly Touch his guitar. She opens her lattice, And sits in the glow Of the moonlight and starlight, A statue of snow; And she sings in a voice That is broken with sighs, And she darts on her lover The light of her eyes. His love-speaking pantomime Tells her his soul,— How wild in that sunny clime Hearts and eyes roll. She waves with her white hand Her white fazzolet, And her burning thoughts flash From her eyes' living jet. The moonlight is hid In a vapor of snow; Her voice and his rebeck Alternately flow; Re-echoed they swell From the rock on the hill; They sing their farewell, And the music is still. TO THE HOUSTONIA CERULEA. A very delicate and humble flower of New England, blossoming early in spring, and often covering large patches of turf with a white or pale blue carpet. The botanical allusions in this piece are repeated, and perhaps it will not be fully relished by those who have not examined the structure of the flower. How often, modest flower, I mark thy tender blossoms, where they spread Along the turfy slope, their starry bed, Hung heavy with the shower. Thou comest in the dawn Of Nature's promise, when the sod of May Is speckled with its earliest array, And strewest with bloom the lawn. 'T is but a few brief days, I saw the green hill in its fold of snow; But now thy slender stems arise, and blow In April's fitful rays. I love thee, delicate And humble as thou art: thy dress of white, And blue, and all the tints where these unite, Or wrapped in spiral plait, Or to the glancing sun, Shining through checkered cloud, and dewy shower, Unfolding thy fair cross. Yes, tender flower, Thy blended colors run, And meet in harmony, Commingling, like the rainbow tints; thy urn Of yellow rises with a graceful turn, And as a golden eye Its softly swelling throat Shines in the centre of thy circle, where Thy downy stigma rises slim and fair, And catches as they float, A cloud of living air, The atom seeds of fertilizing dust, That hover, as thy lurking anthers burst; And oh! how purely there Thy snowy circle, rayed With crosslets, bends its pearly whiteness round, And how thy spreading lips are trimly bound, With such a mellow shade As in the vaulted blue Deepens at starry midnight, or grows pale When mantled in the full-moon's silver veil, That calm, ethereal hue. I love thee, modest flower! And I do find it happiness to tread, With careful step, along thy studded bed, At morning's freshest hour, Or when the day declines, And evening comes with dewy footsteps on, And, now his golden hall of slumber won, The setting sun resigns His empire of the sky, And the cool breeze awakes her fluttering train. I walk through thy parterres, and not in vain, For to my downward eye, Sweet flower! thou tell'st how hearts As pure and tender as thy leaf, as low And humble as thy stem, will surely know The joy that peace imparts. ON FINDING THE ANEMONE HEPATICA, THE EARLIEST FLOWER OF SPRING. Beside a fading bank of snow A lovely Anemone blew, Unfolding to the sun's bright glow Its leaves of heaven's serenest hue; The snowy stamens gemmed them o'er, The pleasing contrast caught my eye, As on the ocean's sandy shore The purple shells and corals lie. I saw the flower,—what tumults rose Within my heart, what ecstasy! The catpive soul no brighter glows, When hailing life and liberty. 'T is Spring, I cried, pale Winter 's fled, The earliest wreath of flowers is blown; The blossoms withered long and dead Will soon proclaim their tyrant flown. How smiles the sun in yonder sky, How pure the vault of ether swells, How sweet to hear on mountain high The tinkle of the shepherd-bells! The meadows don their green array, The streams in purer currents flow; On sunny knolls the lambkins play, And sport amid the vales below. The humble Anemone blows, The blue-bird now is on the wing; How soon will breathe the blushing rose, How soon will all around be spring! [A tulip blossomed, one morning in May] A tulip blossomed, one morning in May, By the side of a sanded alley; Its leaves were dressed in a rich array, Like the clouds at the earliest dawn of day, When the mist rolls over the valley: The dew had descended the night before, And lay in its velvet bosom, And its spreading urn was flowing o'er, And the crystal heightened the tints it bore On its yellow and crimson blossom. A sweet red-rose, on its bending thorn, Its bud was newly spreading, And the flowing effulgence of early morn Its beams on its breast was shedding; The petals were heavy with dripping tears, That twinkled in pearly brightness, And the thrush in its covert thrilled my ears With a varied song of lightness. A lily, in mantle of purest snow, Hung over a silent fountain, And the wave, in its calm and quiet flow, Displayed its silken leaves below, Like the drift on the windy mountain; It bowed with the moisture the night had wept, When the stars shone over the billow, And white-winged spirits their vigils kept, Where beauty and innocence sweetly slept On its pure and thornless pillow. A hyacinth lifted its purple bell From the slender leaves around it; It curved its cup in a flowing swell, And a starry circle crowned it; The deep-blue tincture that robed it seemed The gloomiest garb of sorrow, As if on its eye no brightness beamed, And it never in clearer moments dreamed Of a fair and a calm to-morrow. A daisy peeped from the tufted sod, In its bashful modesty drooping; Where often the morn, as I lightly trod, In bounding youth, the fallow clod, Had over it seen me stooping; It looked in my face with a dewy eye From its ring of ruby lashes, And it seemed that a brighter was lurking by, The fires of whose ebony lustre fly Like summer's dazzling flashes. And the wind, with a soft and silent wing, Brushed over this wild of flowers, And it wakened the birds, who began to sing Their hymn to the season of love and spring, In the shade of the bending bowers; And it culled their full nectareous store, In its lightly fluttering motion, As when from Hybla's murmuring shore The evening breeze from her thyme-beds bore Their sweetness over the ocean. [A lake once lay, where the thunder-clouds sail] A few years since, a small lake in a wildly romantic situation in the northern part of Vermont was unfortunately drained by the bursting of one of the banks that confined it. The following stanzas are intended for a description of that event. A lake once lay, where the thunder-clouds sail, On the lofty mountain's breast, Whose ripple, when raised by the rustling gale, Was so gentle, it seemed at rest; The pine waved round, and the dark cliff frowned, Their shadow was gloomy as night; But when the sun shone, on his noonday throne, The lake seemed a mirror of light. There the red-finned trout like a flash darted by, And the pickerel moved like the glance of an eye. When the wind breathed soft at the dawning of day, When the morning-birds warbled around, And the rainbow shone on the scarce seen spray, No lovelier place could be found: O, this scene was as dear to mine eye and mine ear, As the glance and the song of my love, And the lake was as bright, and as pure to the sight, As the bosom of angels above: The surface flashed with a golden glow, And a forest of verdure seemed waving below. The year rolled away, and I saw it no more Till the spring bloomed sweetly again, Till the birch first unfolded its leaves on the shore, And the robin first warbled its strain: But no lake smiled there, with its bosom fair, 'T was a dell all with bushes o'ergrown, From my dream of delight, like a sleeper at night, I awoke and I found me alone. Through the vale it had burst with the swiftness of wind, And left but a path of destruction behind. The leaves were all dead on the wave-loving willow, It whispered no more in the wind; No moonbeam slept on the water's soft pillow, Or smiled like the tranquillized mind; The flower-bush there was the fox's lair, And the whippoorwill sung all alone, Where the moonbeams pale, glancing through the vale, Just gleamed on the moss-gray stone. Where the trout once darted, the adder crept, And the rattlesnake coiled where the Naiad wept. By the moon's chill light, the white pebble shone On the beach, where the wave once rolled, And the lustre gleamed on the water-worn stone, But told to the eye it was cold: No rippling wave that beach shall lave, No white foam shall toss on that shore, And the billow's flash, and its scarce heard dash, Shall be known in that valley no more. For the wave, shall be heard the serpent's breath, For the dash of the billow, the hiss of death. Where the foam once sparkled, the cedar-bush waved, And the reed rustled sweet in the gale; And the rock that the water so silently laved Was hid by the gray lichen's veil; There the dark fern flings on the night-wind's wings Its leaves like the dancing feather, And the whippoorwill's note seemed gently to float From the deep purple bloom of the heather. Where the surface glittered, the weed grew wild, And the flower blossomed sweet, where the wave once smiled. So when life first dawns on the infant soul, 'T is as pure as the lake's clear wave; Not a passion is there but can brook control, Not a thought that is pleasure's slave: But youth comes on, and this purity's gone, Fair innocence smiles there no more, And cold is the guest, that lives in that breast, As the stone on this desolate shore; A poison floats in its balmiest breath, And where the flower smiles is the serpent of death. THE MERMAID. I. The waning moon looked cold and pale, Just rising o'er the eastern wave, And faintly moaned the evening gale, That swept along the gloomy cave: The waves that wildly rose and fell, On all the rocks the white foam flung, And like the distant funeral knell, Within her grot the Mermaid sung. II. It was a strain of witchery So sweet, yet mournful to my ear, It lit the smile, it waked the sigh, Then started pity's pearly tear; There was a ruffle in my breast, It was not joy, it was not pain, 'T was wild as yonder billow's crest, That tosses o'er the heaving main. III. Along the wave the moon's cold light With trembling radiance feebly shone; A lustre neither faint nor bright Sparkled on yonder watery stone: There, seated on her sea-beat throne, The Mermaid eyed the dashing wave, Then waked her wild harp's melting tone, And breathed the music of the grave. IV. Her silken tresses, all unbound, Played loosely on the evening gale; She cast a mournful look around, Then sweetly woke her wild harp's wail; And, as her marble fingers flew Along the chords, such music flowed, Her cheek assumed a varied hue, Where grief grew pale, where pleasure glowed. V. The sound rose sweetly on the wind, It was a strain of melancholy,— It soothed each tumult of the mind, And hushed the wildest laugh of folly. It flowed so softly o'er the main, And spread so calmly, widely 'round; The air seemed living with the strain, And every zephyr breathed the sound. VI. The seal, that sported on the shore, His gambols ceased, and pricked his ear; He heeded not the billow's roar,— That strain was all he seemed to hear. As through the surf the dolphins flew, They stopped and played around her throne; It seemed, Arion woke anew His harp to some celestial tone. VII. With what a thrilling ecstasy I heard the music of her lyre; The very soul of melody Seemed warbling on the trembling wire: O, never o'er her infant dear The mother half so fondly hung, As when I bent my soul to hear Those heavenly strains the Mermaid sung. LINES ON VIEWING, ONE SUMMER EVENING, THE HOUSE OF MY BIRTH IN A STATE OF DESERTION. The crescent moon with pallid light Was silvering o'er the brow of night; With downy wing the summer breeze Sported amid the rustling trees, Waving the leaves that lightly flew, And kissing off the night-fallen dew. Along the gently winding vale, Its surface ruffled by the gale, The softly flowing rivulet strayed, While o'er its wave the moonbeam played, Smiling, as calmly stealing by, Like tears of joy in beauty's eye. Through the wood my fancy loved, Rapt in kindling thought, I roved; Not a zephyr shook the spray, To brush the trembling gems away; Not a warble met my ear, All was silent far and near, Still as cypress boughs, that wave Slowly o'er the lonely grave, And weave their deep, impressive gloom,— Fit emblem of the dreary tomb. Down a glen, where, half unseen, Banked with turf of deepest green, Flowed a winding rill along, Tinkling like the milkmaid's song; Where the moon's reflected ray Smiling on the surface lay, Seeming to sleep in soft repose, Like morning dew-drops on the rose; Where the evening splendors fade In the maple's quiet shade; Lonely, desolate appears, Pale as in the vale of years, The mansion where my infant eye First saw the rocks, the woods, the sky. O, it was a lovely sight, Though obscured by shades of night; And though the ivy-mantled wall At intervals was heard to fall, Breaking with faintly rattling sound The quiet hush that reigned around. Through the walks, where privets blew And purple lilacs wildly grew, 'Mid entangling weeds and briers, And the rye-grass' waving spires, 'Neath the pear-tree, where, as Spring Bade her untaught music ring, Purest blooms of snowy white Charmed the fond-reposing sight, And gales of incense whispered by Gentle as the lover's sigh,— I wandered slow, and fondly viewed This scene in evening tears bedewed, And felt around my heart the throe Of tender grief and melting woe, To see a spot so sweet, so dear, Now laid on desolation's bier, And view a scene of loveliness In ruin's wildest, roughest dress. With trembling hand I oped the door, And wandered o'er the mouldering floor; Along the slowly crumbling wall, Where wintry fires were wont to fall And smile with beams of ruddy light, Chasing away the gloom of night, Naught was seen but shadows drear, And sights that filled my soul with fear: Darkened by trickling autumn rains, That left their wild, fantastic stains, Seeming, as stars with feeble ray Reflected o'er the ceiling play, Spirits that swiftly flutter by, And glance like visions on my eye. And there the slowly creeping snail Drew o'er the wall its slimy veil; Its silken web the spider wove To trap the flies that idly rove; While, slumbering through the summer's day, The bat in some lone corner lay, Till, started by my solemn tread, He flapped his wings around my head, And, darting through the broken pane, Sailed on the evening breeze again. The moonbeam shone along the room, Like starlight glistening on a tomb; The clock was still,—its sweet-toned bell No longer rung Time's funeral knell, No more its index seemed to say How swift the moments flew away. All was lonely, all was still, The thrush was silent on the hill, The sheep-bell's shrilly tinkling note Was heard no longer in the cote, No breathing soul the silence broke, No flageolet its sweetness woke, No voice was singing in the vale, No echo floated on the gale; 'T was hushed, but when with droning sound The slow-winged beetle hummed around. Resting on a broken chair, Relic of the ruin there, By the window I reclined And listened to the moaning wind, That whispered through the broken pane. Mournful as the funeral strain. O'er my head the woodbine blew, All its flowers were wet with dew, And sweeter fragrance flowed around, Than ever charmed enchanted ground; So sweet the scent, that Eden's gale Seemed breathing through the desert vale. Ivy hung its tendrils there, And trembled in the dewy air, Twisting around the shattered frame, Where still a rudely sculptured name Half hid in lichens caught my eye, And told me of the years gone by. Beneath my eye, and in the shade An aged elm, low bending, made, A modest rose-bush reared its head, And far around its sweetness shed. Two damask flowers, with leaflets pale, Were lightly trembling on the gale, And, as the moonbeam o'er them shone, Seemed like two mourners left alone Amid those scenes, where gay delight, Frolic ever dancing light, Woke their shouts of rapture wild, And cheerfulness serenely smiled. All,—all were gone. Like insects gay, That sport them in the summer ray, Young Happiness, so sweetly blown, With hurrying wing away had flown, Vanished in night the vision fair, And left these two to wither there. Soon I glanced my roving eye On a sprig of rosemary; Hid in grass that rankly grew, There the humble floweret blew, Bashful 'neath the rose's shade All its modest hues displayed; As the maiden sweet as May, With her eye of heavenly ray, Shrinking from the world's rude storm, Hides in shades obscure her form. On its lip of paly blue, Smiled in peace a pearl of dew; 'T was a melancholy flower, Such as in affliction's hour O'er the heaving turf I 'd throw, To deck the friend that rests below. Glancing farther o'er the scene, Gay with flowers and soft with green; But now beneath the moon's pale light All seemed one color to the sight. Such the mellow fading tint, When the fays their footsteps print, Where the tiny billows break On the gently heaving lake: 'T was not ebon, 't was not green, Mingled hues that melt between; As when beside the taper's ray The maiden weeps the hours away, And seen at distance faintly glows, Her grief-worn cheek's decaying rose, Till every soft and winning charm Dissolves into a sylphid form. O'er the slowly winding flood, 'Mid the shadows of the wood, And in the meadow spread before The ruined mansion's broken door, I saw in gently veering flight The insect lightning of the night, Shining with a feeble ray, As it slowly sailed away, Or twinkling with a sudden spark, Spangling the scenery wild and dark. So the meteor light of fame Glows with such a fickle flame, So all happiness below Is an insect's transient glow: For a time it sweetly smiles, Dressed in fancy's dearest wiles; Mirth amid his rosy bowers Laughs away the gliding hours, The moments of a short-lived day That steals like air unseen away; Love entwines his silken chain, And breathes his soft, enchanting strain; Joy awakes his twisted shell To the notes that please him well; Hope's gay colors richly blend, And tell of sports that never end; While jovial Pleasure's golden dawn Sparkles awhile, and all is gone. Farther still I turned my eyes, Where the waving forests rise, Where the hills with easy swell, Rising from the lowly dell, Smile beneath the pallid ray, Till they fade in mist away. Upward to the sky I turned, Where the stars serenely burned, And around the lonely pole Saw the Bear its lustre roll. There amid the lofty blue, Veiled in robe of silver hue, Luna showed her crescent pale, And trembled through her misty veil: Round her orb the halo shone Lovely as the milky zone, When, in winter's cloudless night, It spreads o'er heaven its belt of light. “Silvery planet! kindly shed On thy humble votary's head Thy serenest rays, and shine On my brow with beam divine. Light me through this world of sorrow, Till I find a fair to-morrow; Till the woes that rack my breast Slumber in an infant's rest. When my corpse is lowly laid Where the yews in weave their shade, Through the boughs that slowly wave, Smile serenely on my grave. “Never will thy pallid ray O'er such lovely waters play, Never shine on fairer bowers Through the evening's quiet hours, Nor shed thy flood of spotless light On scenes more beauteous or more bright.” Land of my nativity! How thou charm'st the wearied eye! O, thou hast a genial balm, That can the saddest bosom calm! Smiling in the dewy dawn, When the songsters o'er the lawn Open their mellifluous throats And warble their enchanting notes, Glowing when the noon-tide beam Gilds the flowery bordered stream, And charming at the close of day, When the twilight fades away. Mountains swelling to the sky, Forests frowning on the eye, Waving woodlands, meadows gay, Streamlets where the minnows play, Winding valleys, swelling hills, Crystal fountains, tinkling rills, Smile in morning's rosy light, And melt amid the shades of night. Such thy scenes, for ever dear, Whether far away or near; Whether smiling on the eye, Or in the hues of memory. When I leave this desert vale, Thou wilt ever bid me wail, Always wake the parting sigh, And draw the tear-drop from my eye. THE PARTING OF WILLIAM AND MARY. “We part, perhaps to meet no more: To distant lands from thee I go; Far, far beyond the ocean's roar, For thee my tears will ever flow: “An exile from my native land, I long must plough the raging main: Alas! no Mary's gentle hand Shall soothe my bosom's inward pain. “Thou weep'st, my love:—how dear those tears, What treasures to thy William's heart! They banish all his anxious fears,— They blunt the point of sorrow's dart,— “They tell me Mary loves me still, And grieves to bid her last adieu: O, guard her, Heaven, from every ill, And keep her to her William true!” “And wilt thou, William, think no more, When far beyond the raging main, How Mary lingers on this shore, And strains to catch thy sail in vain? “O William! let thy wishes rise And send them o'er the wave to me: The Power that rules in yonder skies Will hear the vows of constancy.” “Yes, I will think when far away, How thou art weeping on this shore; Dark be the hour, and cursed the day, When I shall muse on thee no more. “But hark! the signal! we must part:— While life remains, let us be true; Yes, though I feel a bursting heart, I now must bid my last adieu.” Her drooping head his Mary laid Upon the youth she loved so well: He gently kissed the sinking maid, And breathed upon her lips farewell; Then tore him from her fond embrace, And dashed the tear-drops from his eye; Just gazed upon her angel-face, Then turned and marked the streamers fly. He shouted, as he leaped on board, To hide his bosom's inward pain; The sails were set,—the loud winds roared,— The ship ploughed foaming to the main. “VANITY OF VANITIES, ALL IS VANITY.” On Reggio's classic shore I stood, And looked across the wave below, And saw the sea, a glassy flood, In all the hues of morning glow; The Fata Morgana. Groves waved aloft on sunward hills, Their leaves were green and tipped with gold, And all the dazzling pomp that fills The sunset skies was round them rolled; Arches on arches, proudly piled, Seemed towering to the deep-blue sky, And ruins lay deserted, wild, And torrents foamed and thundered by; And flowery meadows soft and green In living emerald met the light, And o'er their dewy turf were seen, In countless gems, the drops of night; And gardens, full of freshest flowers, Unfurled the pictured veil of Spring, And round the gay and perfumed bowers Sweet-warbling birds were on the wing; And many a tall and stately spire Rose to the clouds, that loosely curled, And, kindled each with solar fire, Seemed beings of a brighter world; And mountains reared their giant head. And lifted high their peak of snow, And o'er its wide, majestic bed The ocean seemed to ebb and flow; And all the wonders of the skies And earth and sea were thrown around, And all were stained in deepest dyes, And vast as Being's utmost bound; And on the magic scene I gazed, And as behind the hills arose The golden sun, awhile it blazed In brighter tints, and then it closed, And all the changing pageant passed, In faint and fainter hues, away, Until a tender green, at last, Glassed o'er the still and waveless bay, And Reggio's towers, Messina's wall, The hills, the woods, the frequent sail That trembled on the stream, were all The relics of the fairy tale. 'T was evening, and the sun went down, Deep crimsoned in the frowning sky, And Night, in robe of dusky brown, Hung out her lurid veil on high; A mist crept o'er the lonely wild, That heaved, a sandy ocean, round, And loosely lay, in billows piled, To the horizon's farthest bound; The sun, as if involved in blood, Shone through the fog with direful beam, And from behind the hills a flood Of liquid purple poured its stream, And o'er the dusty desert flowed, Until, as kindled by the rays, The heated plain intensely glowed, Like some wide forest in a blaze; And riding o'er the distant waste The burning sand-spout stalked along, And as the horrid phantom passed, The driver keener plied his thong, And shrieked, as on the Simoom roared, As if the gathered fiends of hell, Around in vengeful armies poured, Had rung the world's decisive knell; But far away a bright Oase The Mirage of the Desert. Shone sweetly in the eastern sky, As fair as in the magic glass Groves, lawns, and hills, and waters lie; A lake in mirrored brightness lay, Spread like an overflowing Nile, Its peaceful rippling seemed to play, And curl in Summer's sweetest smile; The sunset tinged the surface o'er, And here it lay in sheeted gold, And there the ruffled stream, before The evening breeze, in emerald rolled; And many a white and platted sail Dropped softly down the silent tide, Or as the rising winds prevail, Careening low was seen to glide; And there the fisher plied his oar, And spread his net, and hung his pole, And drove with palm boughs to the shore, In crowds, the gayly glittering shoal; And birds were ever on the wing, Or lightly plashing in the flood, And, gorgeous as an Eastern king, In stately pomp the flammant stood; And herds of lowing buffaloes, And light gazelles, came down to drink, And there the river-horse arose, And stalked a giant to the brink; And shepherds drove their pastured flocks To taste the cool, refreshing wave, And on the heathy-mantled rocks The goats their tender bleating gave: And o'er the green and rice-clad plain, In coats of crimson, gold, and blue, The small birds trilled their mellow strain, And revelled in the falling dew; And there the palm its pillar heaves, And spreads its umbelled crown of flowers, And broad and pointed glossy leaves, Whose shade the idle camp embowers; And there the aged sit and tell Their tales, as high the light smoke curls, And eye the dance, around the well, Of fiery youths and black-eyed girls, Or where in many a leap and curve They keenly rush around the ring, And with an aim that cannot swerve, In eager strife, the jerreed fling; And there beside the bubbling fount The date its welcome shadow threw, And many a child was seen to mount, And pluck the fruit that on it grew; And with its broad and pendent boughs, The thickly tufted sycamore, The image of profound repose, Waved silently along the shore; And mangroves bent their limbs to taste The wave, that calmly floated by, And showed beneath, as purely glassed, A softer image of the sky; And groves of myrtle sweetly blew, And hung their boughs with spikes of snow, And beds of flowering cassia threw A splendor like the morning glow; And o'er the wild, that stretched away To meet the sands, now steeped with rain, The lilies, in their proud array, With pictured brightness gemmed the plain And roses, damask, white, and red, Stood breathing perfume on the rocks, And there the dry acacia spread Its deep, unfading yellow locks; And gardens brighter bloomed the while Around the silver-tiled kiosk, And brighter shone with sacred smile The gilded crescent on the mosque; And over all calm evening drew A tender, softly dimming veil, And mellowed down each gayer hue To tints that seemed divinely pale; It was a lovely resting-place, The traveller's home, the pilgrim's well, Where he might sit at ease and trace His wanderings, and his dangers tell; It rose at once upon their sight, Like Paradise from Heaven descending, And there, with keen and eager light, Each look, in panting hope, was bending; An island on the pathless waste, It caught the weary camel's eye, And on he flew in wildest haste, As if to drink the wave, and die; And there the fainting Bedouin gazed, As if the cup of life were given, And then with thankful look he raised His withered hands in prayer to Heaven; And as he hurried on his road O'er burning sand, and flinty rock, Before his eye the phantom flowed, A flattering, but delusive mock; Its brightest tints grew wan and pale, Its fairer features faded dim, Till in a dark and lonely vale A mist alone was seen to swim; And as the tear in anguish stole, The last and faintest beam of day Fled, and the dream was seen to roll And vanish in the night away; And cold the wild Harmattan blew, And rolled the dusty billow by, But still no welcome rain nor dew Came down to soothe their misery; Parched, burnt, in agony they tread The waste, in hopeless longing, o'er, A frowning sky above their head, A shoreless sea of sand before. And life is but a fairy tale: Its fondest and its brightest hours Are transient as the passing gale, Or drops of dew that melt in flowers; And life is but a fleeting dream, A shadow of a pictured sky, The airy phantom of a stream, That flattering smiles, and hurries by; The mists that hover o'er the deep, The Mirage of the Ocean. And seem the storm-beat sailor's home, And, still retiring, always keep Their station on the farthest foam; Till imaged out, his woods and hills, His father's cot, the village spire, And all his heated fancy wills, And all his eager hopes desire, The white chalk coast that fronts the billow, The boat that trimly scuds below, The brook that glides beneath the willow, With lulling chime and quiet flow; Till all he loves, and all he longs To meet and fold his arms around, Come crowding in alluring throngs, And every charm of home is found; And round the ship the meadow lies, That filled his hand with flowers in May, And as the billows onward rise, They spread and blossom green and gay; But if he stoop to pluck the grass, That waves in frolic mimicry, Away the darling phantoms pass, And leave alone the bitter sea: And life is but a painted bow, That crowns our days to come with smiles, The mingled tints of Heaven, that throw Their pomp on glory's airy piles; But when we run to catch the gay And glittering pageant, all is o'er, And all its bright and rich array Can draw us fondly on no more; 'T is like the moon who shines so clear Above the mountains and the groves, And seems to float along so near The boy, he grasps the moon he loves, And dreams it is some sweet, bright face, Who smiles in such a pleasant sky, And he would think it heaven to pass His still, soft nights that maiden by; He sits upon the grassy bank, And rests his face upon his hand, And looks intent, as if he drank The light that silvers sea and land; And though she smiles so sweetly on Her fond and loving shepherd boy, The same bright face is ever won By those who make the night their joy. O, life and all its charms decay! Alluring, cheating, on they go; The stream for ever steals away In one irrevocable flow; Its dearest charms, the charms of love, Are fairest in their bud, and die Whene'er their tender bloom we move; We touch the leaves, they withered lie. At distance all how gay, how sweet, A very land of fairy blisses, Where smiles, and tears, and soft words meet, And willing lips unite in kisses; But when we touch the magic shore, The glow is gone, the charm is fled; We find the dearest hues it wore Are but the light around the dead, And cold the hymeneal chain That binds their cheated hearts in one, And on, with many a step of pain, Their weary race is sadly run; And still, as on they plod their way, They find, as life's gay dreams depart, To close their being's toilsome day, Naught left them but a broken heart. THE FAIREST ROSE IS FAR AWA'. The morn is blinking o'er the hills With softened light and colors gay; Through grove and valley sweetly trills The melody of early day; The dewy roses blooming fair Glitter around her father's ha', But still my Mary is not there,— The fairest rose is far awa'. The cooling zephyrs gently blow Along the dew-bespangled mead,— In every field the owsen low,— The careless shepherd tunes his reed; And while the roses blossom fair, My lute with softly dying fa' Laments that Mary is not there,— The fairest rose is far awa'. The thrush is singing on the hills, And charms the groves that wave around, And through the vale the winding rills Awake a softly murmuring sound; The robin tunes his mellow throat Where glittering roses sweetly blaw, But grieves that Mary hears him not,— The fairest rose is far awa'. Why breathe thy melody in vain, Thou lovely songster of the morn? Why pour thy ever-varying strain Amid the sprays of yonder thorn? Do not the roses blooming fair, At morning's dawn or evening's fa', Tell thee of one that is not there,— The fairest rose that 's far awa'? THE FLOWER OF THE VALLEY. Sweet flower of the valley, why droop'st thou so low? Ah! why is thy beauty all faded and gone? Ah! who could destroy thee,—who wield the sad blow,— Who rifle thy charms in their earliest dawn? So gay was the morning that rose as you blew, So fragrant the zephyrs that fluttered around, So soft didst thou smile through thy mantle of dew, No lovelier flower in the valley was found. But see, on the turf all thy beauties are laid, Thy leaves, they are scattered, thy sweetness is gone: Thy colors—once gay as the rainbow—now fade As fast as the hues that enliven the dawn. Sweet flower! once the sweetest that bloomed in the vale,— Sweet flower! we will weep, for thy beauties are fled,— For those charms that are gone we will pour the sad wail, And chant o'er thy ruins the dirge of the dead. LINES WRITTEN ON HEARING A LADY SING IN THE TOWER OF MONTEVIDEO, NEAR HARTFORD. The soft dews of twilight are steeping the plain, And gemming the boughs of the willow; The eve-star is lighting its twinkle again, To shine on the foam of the billow. The south breeze is brushing the breast of the lake, That swells with a light heaving motion, And its ripple is heard on the pebbles to break Like the slumbering wave of the ocean. The gale on its pinions of gossamer flies Through the boughs of the low bending willow, And sweeping the forest, it mournfully sighs O'er the turf of my flowery pillow. It bears on its wing, from the dark, lonely tower, O'er the mead, and the wave's “playful motion,” The song of the maid, who at eve's balmy hour Sings her sweet breathing strain of devotion: Like the hymn of a seraph, it floats through the grove, And sighs o'er the slope of the mountain; How sweet, how enchanting, its warble of love! How it lulls, like the glow of the fountain! As I listen, I fancy the dew-dropping cloud That glows with a lovely “to-morrow,” An angel conceals in its ebony shroud, Whose harp breathes her accent of sorrow. [Once, on a cloudless summer-day] Once, on a cloudless summer-day, Beneath a mantling vine I lay, When Cupid came by chance that way, And aimed at me an arrow. He laid the dart upon the bow, And drew the horn and sinew so, And said, “My friend, you soon will know, How keenly stings my arrow.” His cheek was gay, his eye was bright, And shot a piercing, bitter light: He drew the nerve all tense and tight, And then let fly his arrow. The bow twanged sharp, and with a bound At once its mark the weapon found; I tingled with the fiery wound Of that soul-kindling arrow. He flapped his wings, away he flew, And, turning backward, looked me through, And slyly laughed, as forth I drew The heart-encrimsoned arrow. I felt my blood like lava glow, I writhed, and twined, and wrestled so, As madmen in their dying throe,— I broke and cursed the arrow. It is indeed a cruel thing, When early youth is on the wing, To feel, and keenly feel, the sting Of such a poisoned arrow. [My heart too firmly trusted, fondly gave] My heart too firmly trusted, fondly gave Itself to all its tenderness a slave; I had no wish but thee, and only thee; I saw no joy, no hope, beyond thy smile; I knew no happiness, but only while Thy love-lit eyes were kindly turned on me. I took the tender image to my breast, I made it there a dear, a cherished guest, I laid it on the pillow of my soul; I gave it all my feeling, and around The fond idea all my heart-strings bound; In that one point I blent my being's whole. But thou hast gone, and left me here to bear The weight of loneliness; thou thinkest not, where Bright forms caress thee, of my bosom torn By thee so coldly; but I cannot rend Thy image from my heart, I cannot blend Hate with the love so long, so fondly borne. I feel my spirit falter, and my frame Trembling and faint with weakness, but the flame Of passion burns as brightly:—I will lay My forehead on my pillow, and resign My bosom to its torture, nor repine, And let the fire consume my life away. [How beautiful is Night!] How beautiful is Night! A smile is on her brow; Her eyes of dewy light Look out, serenely bright, Upon the waves below: The waters, in their flow, Just murmur, and the air Hath scarce a breath to show A spirit moving there: The world is purely fair, The winds are hushed and still; The moonlight on the hill Is sleeping, and her ray Along the falling rill, In lightly dancing play, Soft winding, steals away: A cool and silent breath, From waterfalls and streams, Comes o'er my ear, like dreams, Which, in the pictured death Of slumber, on the soul Delicious whispers roll; And lead, in mazy light, Before the spirit's eye, Sweet visions of delight, In trains of beauty, by. How fair and calm is Night! Amid the dewy bowers She guides the silent Hours, With fairy steps, along, And round the floating throng A cloudy vesture throws; And loosely on the air She spreads their raven hair To every wind that blows: They seem to hover by, Between me and the sky, Each with a golden zone, A waving robe of snow, A veil, whose folds are thrown In undulating flow, Like clouds, when breezes blow; So to my fancy's view The sylphid people play Around the vaulted blue, And then they melt away, And leave the sky all bright, With lamps of living light; And as I fondly gaze, Where countless cressets blaze, I look to heaven and say, “How beautiful is Night!” [Often, when at night delaying] Often, when at night delaying, Where the winding river flows, On the silent waters playing How the star of beauty glows! In the clear wave brightly sparkling, Brightly as the love-lit eye, Now again its beams are darkling, As the clouds athwart it fly: With a soft and tender feeling When I whisper out my song, While the mellow brook is stealing Silently the sand along. There is in that twinkling planet More than all the stars can boast, And my fond eye loves to scan it, Like a light-house on a coast, Where the budding Spring is ever Pranking out her wooing bowers, And the locks of beauty never Float without a crown of flowers, And her eye is ever straying Round and round with kindling beam, Like her own bright planet playing Sweetly on the silent stream. Now the star is near the mountain Slowly setting in the west, Shining on a crisping fountain, Or a lakelet's ruffled breast; Now its maiden brightness mingles With the mist that hovers there, Rising from the woody dingles, Like a streaming tress of hair; Now a form is imaged round it, 'T is the form that I adore; Every charm of earth has crowned it, Fairer, beauty never wore: Oh! how dear that tender feeling, When the rays of beauty play, Where the mellow brook is stealing, Lighted by the moon, away. SONG. O, pure is the wind, As it blows o'er the mountain; And clear is the wave, As it flows from the fountain; And sweet are the flowers In the green meadow blooming; And gay are the bowers, When the soft air perfuming. O go, dearest, go To the heath, and the mountain, Where the blue violets blow On the brink of the fountain; Where nothing but death Our affection can sever, And till life's latest breath Love shall bind us for ever. O, bright is the morn, When it breaks on the valley; And shrill is the horn, When the wild huntsmen sally; And clear shines the dew, As the hounds hurry o'er it; And light blows the wind, As the sail flies before it. O go, dearest, go, &amp;c. O, soft is the mist, When it curls round the island; And dark is the cloud, As it hangs on the highland; And sweet chimes the rill, O'er the white pebble flowing; And quick glides the boat, O'er the smooth water rowing. O go, dearest, go, &amp;c. O, fleet is the deer Through the blue heather springing, And loud is the shout Through the wild valley ringing; And soft is the flute, O'er the lake faintly sighing, When the wide air is mute, And the night-wind is dying. O go, dearest, go, &amp;c. O go, dearest, go To the heath and the mountain; Where the heart shall be pure, As the clear-flowing fountain; Where the soul shall be free, As the winds that blow o'er us, And the sunset of life Smile in beauty before us. O, go, dearest, go To the heath, and the mountain, Where the blue violets blow On the brink of the fountain; Where nothing but death Our affection can sever, And till life's latest breath Love shall bind us for ever. THE LAND OF THE BLEST. The sunset is calm on the face of the deep, And bright is the last look of day in the west, And broadly the beams of its parting glance sweep, Like the path that conducts to the land of the blest: All golden and green is the sea, as it flows In billows just heaving its tide to the shore; And crimson and blue is the sky, as it glows With the colors which tell us that daylight is o'er. I sit on a rock that hangs over the wave, And the foam heaves and tosses its snow-wreaths below, And the flakes, gilt with sunbeams, the flowing tide pave, Like the gems that in gardens of sorcery grow: I sit on the rock, and I watch the light fade Still fainter and fainter away in the west, And I dream I can catch, through the mantle of shade, A glimpse of the dim, distant land of the blest. And I long for a home in that land of the soul, Where hearts always warm glow with friendship and love, And days ever cloudless still cheerily roll, Like the age of eternity blazing above: There, with friendships unbroken, and loves ever true, Life flows on, one gay dream of pleasure and rest; And green is the fresh turf, the sky purely blue, That mantle and arch o'er the land of the blest. The last line of light is now crossing the sea, And the first star is lighting its lamp in the sky; It seems that a sweet voice is calling to me, Like a bird on that pathway of brightness to fly: “Far over the wave is a green sunny isle, Where the last cloud of evening now shines in the west; 'T is the island that Spring ever woos with her smile; O, seek it,—the bright, happy land of the blest!” [My heart was a mirror, that showed every treasure] My heart was a mirror, that showed every treasure Of beauty and loveliness life can display; It reflected each beautiful blossom of pleasure, But turned from the dark looks of bigots away; It was living and moving with loveliest creatures, In smiles or in tears, as the soft spirit chose; Now shining with brightest and ruddiest features, Now pale as the snow of the dwarf mountain-rose. These visions of sweetness for ever were playing, Like butterflies fanning the still summer air; Some sported a moment, some, never decaying, In deep hues of love are still lingering there: At times some fair spirit, descending from Heaven, Would shroud all the rest in the blaze of its light; Then wood nymphs and fays o'er the mirror were driven, Like the fire-swarms that kindle the darkness of night. But the winds and the storms broke the mirror, and severed Full many a beautiful angel in twain; And the tempest raged on, till the fragments were shivered And scattered, like dust, as it rolls o'er the plain: One piece, which the storm, in its madness, neglected Away, on the wings of the whirlwind, to bear, One fragment was left, and that fragment reflected All the beauty that Mary threw carelessly there. [O, now's the hour, when air is sweet] O, now's the hour, when air is sweet, And birds are all in tune, To seek with me the cool retreat, In bright and merry June; When every rose-bush has a nest, And every thorn a flower, And every thing on earth is blest, This sweet and holy hour. O come, my dear, when evening flings Her veil of purple round, And zephyr, on his dewy wings, Sweeps o'er the flowery ground; When every bird of day is still, And stars are bright above, O come, my dear, and we will fill Our cup, and drink of love. We'll fill it from the pure blue sky, And from the glowing west, And catch its spirit in thine eye, And in the small bird's nest; And take its sweetness from the flowers, Its freshness from the spring, Its coolness from the dewy hours, When night-hawks take the wing. Then we will wander far away, Along the flowery vale, Where winds the brook, in sparkling play, And freshly blows the gale; And we will sit beneath the shade That maples weave above, And, on the mossy pillow laid, Will drink the cup of love. [O, wilt thou go with me, love] O, wilt thou go with me, love, And seek the lonely glen? O, wilt thou leave for me, love, The smiles of other men?— The birds are there aye singing, And the woods are full of glee, And love shall there be flinging His roses over thee. O, wilt thou go with me, dear, And share my humble lot? O, wilt thou live with me, dear, Within a lowly cot?— Though beauty hath enshrouded thee With all that 's sweet and fair, The sorrows that have clouded thee Shall all be wanting there. O, wilt thou go with me, Anne, To yonder mountain side, And, happy there in me, Anne, Ne'er sigh for aught beside?— O, Heaven shall there be over us, Unclouded, pure, and bright, And wings of love shall cover us, And all around be light. Yes, thou wilt go with me, love, I see it in thy smile, And I will be to thee, love, Thy shelter all the while; And thou shalt spread thy bloom around, And be all sweet and fair, And every sight and touch and sound Shall be ecstatic there. Yes, thou wilt go with me, dear, The cot shall be thy home, And never near its roof, dear, Shall want or sorrow come; O, I will be the parent dove, That hovers o'er her nest, And we will know how sweet is love Caressing and caressed. Yes, thou wilt go with me, Anne, Though seas are now between, And thou wilt dwell with me, Anne, In woodlands flowered and green; I cannot cross the sea to thee, I do not love that shore, So cross the ocean, dear, to me, And we will part no more. [Here the air is sweet] Here the air is sweet, Fresh from the roses newly blowing; Here the waters meet, Down the grassy valley flowing; Here the bands of ivy twine, Here the bells in yellow shine On the flowering gelsemine, Round the woven trellis growing. Here the flitting breeze Wafts afar the musky treasure, And the wanton bees Sip the honeyed fount of pleasure; Here the loving spirits dwell, Here they sit, and weave their spell, And within the blossom's bell Tune their soul-dissolving measure. Here the wind is balm, Laden with the breath of roses; Here the air is calm, And the sleeping noon-flower closes; Now the sun is setting bright, And his arch of purple light Heralding the summer night, Earth in dreams of bliss reposes. Here 's a magic bower: O'er it budding vines are creeping, And a dewy shower, By, a bank of turf is steeping; Though the fallen winds are mute, Faintly from the sweet-blown flute, Tones, that with the stillness suit, Harmonies of love are keeping. I am here alone: Far has fled my flowery dreaming, All its beauty flown Like a bow by moonlight gleaming; Fancy's day of love is o'er, All its rich and golden store Ne'er can charm my spirit more With its false, but fairy seeming. THE WANDERING SPIRIT. There's a voice that is heard in the depth of the sky, Where nothing is seen but the blue-tinted heaven; That voice with the wind rolls its mellowness by, And a few notes alone to our fond ears are given: The spirit who sings it still hastens away, He is doomed round the wide earth for ever to roam, He may settle a moment, but never will stay, For he ne'er found, and never will find, here a home. There is grief in the voice, as it comes through the air, Like the low-moaning wind in the calmness of even, Or the tone, as we dream, of the angels, who bear The pure soul, that rises to mingle with heaven; It was clear when it first came, but quickly afar It murmured and died, like the wave on the shore, When the mariner hails the benevolent star, That rises and smiles, and the tempest is o'er. O, that voice is the dirge that for ever is sung O'er the wreck and the ruin of beauty and love, But in ears that are deaf is its melody flung, There are none who will listen, but pure ones above: O, earth is no place for the spirit who feels Every wound of the heart with the pang of despair; He will mourn, and be never at home, till he steals To the skies, and the bright world that welcomes him there. FAREWELL TO MY LYRE. Lyre of my soul! the parting hour draws nigh, The hour that tears thy votary away,— The hour when death shall close my fading eye, And wrap in earth my cold and lifeless clay. I feel his icy fingers chill my heart, And curdle all the blood that warms my breast; Charm of my darkest moments! soon we part,— Soon shall thy chords in endless silence rest. What if thy sounds have charmed the coldest ear,— What if they breathed like melody divine,— What if they stole the fair one's purest tear, Or bade the downcast eye with pleasure shine! Still I must sink in death's unbroken sleep, And coldly slumber 'neath the hallowed ground; And thou must all thy chords in silence keep, Nor sweetly wake them to the feeblest sound. Sleep in yon cypress shade,—its heavy gloom Becomes the awful stillness of the grave; Rest, where, above yon maiden's early tomb, The willow's boughs in sorrow seem to wave. There should the fainting zephyr, whispering by, Awake one note along thy tuneful string, O, be it sadder than the mourner's sigh, And in my ear like funeral dirges ring. Let not a trill of joy invade my ear, This gloomy hour asks nothing of delight: Let all be like the pall that shades the bier, Or like the darkest canopy of night. Let no sweet songster pour its witching spell— No voice of comfort to my spirit come; Naught but the echo of the passing-bell, The hollow murmur of the muffled drum. And yet I seem to hear thy seraph strain Pour like a gentle stream along the gale: It ceases,—now its music wakes again, And breathes as sweetly as the turtle's wail. Ah, I would brush thy chords and faintly wake To sounds of joy thy melody awhile,— Would charm my heart a moment ere it break, And gild my dying features with a smile: But no! my hand refuses: 't is but clay,— The touch of death has withered all its powers; Soon will its wings my spirit waft away From thee, thou charmer of my darkest hours! Farewell, thou lyre of sweetest minstrelsy! Distraction calls, its sufferer must obey; The ruthless hand of dark adversity Has chilled my soul, and torn thy chords away: The mist of death, that hovers o'er my eyes, Withdraws thy lovely image from my view; Like fancy's midnight dream, th' illusion flies,— Lyre of my soul, adieu! a long adieu. [Care-worn, and sunk in deep despondency] Care-worn, and sunk in deep despondency, I bless the hours that lay my thought at rest: I woo the covert of a midnight sky, But sink in feverish dreams, by doubt distrest. The pleasing morning of my early days, My opening fortune's bright and flattering bloom, Gone are they all, and mute the voice of praise: How hard to one who shone, this cruel doom! Would I were in some lonely desert born, And 'neath the sordid roof my being drew; Were nursed by poverty the most forlorn, And ne'er one ray of hope or pleasure knew. Then had my soul been never taught to rise; Then had I never dreamed of power or fame; No pictured scene of bliss deceived my eyes, Nor glory lighted in my breast its flame. What to the wretch like me this towering mind! 'T is but a curse,—a pang that racks the soul. Better in humble life to be resigned To ceaseless toil, as round the seasons roll. Happy the life that in a peaceful stream, Obscure, unnoticed, through the vale has flowed; The heart that ne'er was charmed by fortune's gleam, Is ever sweet contentment's blest abode. But can I leave the scenes my fancy drew In colors rich as heaven, and strong as light; Can I avert from fame my longing view, And plunge again amid my native night? Hard is the pang that rends these links away, And humbling to my soul to rise no more; How cruel to abandon wisdom's ray, And find my hopes, my fame, my prospects o'er! Yes, I must yield,—but slowly I retire; O, can I dim the light that science gave? O, can I quench my bosom's ardent fire? Welcome, ye paths, that lead me to my grave. ANACREONTICS. I. ? ?? ??????? ?????. Anac. Od. ?. Earth is a thirsty drinker, The trees drink from its bosom, The ocean drinks the wet winds, The fiery sun the ocean, The moon drinks in the sun's light. Then why, my friends, be angry, Because I love to drink too. II. Full-bosomed maids of Chio! Around your auburn tresses The woven roses twining, Now sport in circling dances. The moon is on the ocean, The light, loose clouds around her Their fleecy heaps are piling, And gird her with a halo: No longer from the billow The fresh sea-wind is stealing; His pinions wet with night-dew, And bathed in liquid odors, He slumbers on the flower-bed, And lies till morning wake him. Then come, ye maids of Chio! And while your dark eyes sparkle, Full eyes of living brightness, Weave in your mazy dances The flowery chain of Ero, And round our yielding bosoms Its rings of roses linking, Give us those glowing kisses, That drop the tempting treasures Of Aphrodite's nectar. III. Dear girl of Mytilene! Thy dark locks loosely flowing, Thy full, round, jet eye sparkling With soul-subduing glances, Thy brown cheek flushed and glowing, Thy lips, like opening rose-buds Their earliest balm exhaling, Thy slender hands of coral, Whose light and fairy fingers, The cittern sweetly tuning, Awake the song of Sappho, And echo, “Lovely Phaon! Adored, but cruel Phaon!” Dear girl of Mytilene! Beneath the bending vine-bower, That hangs its loaded clusters Full-swoln with purple nectar, And o'er the vaulted trellis Its tendrils, wildly ramping, With broad, green leaves inwoven, Shut out the star and moonlight,— Dear girl of Mytilene! As in that secret bower Thy love-lorn song is flowing, The shepherd, on the moss bank All silvered o'er with moonlight, Beside a dimpling fountain, Shall play upon his tabret, Responsive to thy echoes, The dying song of Sappho To loved, but cruel Phaon. HORATIAN. “Quem tu, Melpomene, semel.”— Horat. Od. L. IV. 3. Fairest of all, bright Urania! Who, on Helicon's top, sing to the golden stars, When Night draws all her curtains round, And far over the hills shines the moon's mellow light; First she gilds the tall mountain-top, Then on glittering streams, and the wide-spreading plain, And the dark waves of the tossing sea, Pours all her mellowest beams, till earth and ocean smile. Fairest of all, bright Urania! Sing to thy golden-stringed lyre, sing the sweet song of Heaven. [Come on your sky-blue wings, ye Paphian doves!] Come on your sky-blue wings, ye Paphian doves! And o'er me drop the pure Idalian dews, Come, fan the air with silken pinions, Pluck with tender bill the roses, While they open in the thickets, Heavy with the tears of morning: Bear them on the faltering breezes, As they waken with Aurora, Lightly brushing o'er the meadow, Kissing, as they pass, the lilies; Sighing through the silent forest, Waking from their nightly slumbers All its murmuring tones and echoes; Floating o'er the sleeping ocean, When without a wave or billow, Like a green and golden mirror, In the morning light it glows; Bear these nectar-breathing blossoms, Hovering round on rustling pinions, Drop them on my mossy pillow, Till a heap of crimson sweetness Buries in its down my head. O come, ye Paphian doves! from Cyprus come; Close o'er the smiling queen of love and joy Your wavy pinions, that a canopy Of living sapphire, gold, and amethyst, Emerald and hyacinth and orient pearl, Cool her and shield her in its moving shade. The Paphian Goddess, on her sea-born car Of polished shell, sails lightly on the wind: Before her chirp the bounding sparrows, As they draw the lovely burden With a trace of gauzy film: She nearer comes and sends before Her harbinger, the breath of roses, Sweeter than the spicy gales That blow from Araby, the blest; Where, resting on white coffee-beds, Or groves of frankincense and myrrh, They drink the airs of Paradise; Sweeter than a languid zephyr, From a flowering myrtle thicket, Which, beside the briny billow, Sucks the essences of love, And by the secret arts of Nature, To the most refined sweetness, Floating in a cloud of ether, Turns the salt and bitter wave. Drop on my head those thrilling dews, So oft in childhood's tender hours You poured in kindling showers around. But no,—my brow is cold,— Passion's fire is spent,— The dews no sooner touch my forehead, Than they freeze to crystal drops, And scornful bound away. [Man is born to die] I once thought of writing a poem in the irregular measure of Thalaba, the scene to be laid in Peru, among the Incas. I however wrote only the following morceaux. Man is born to die, And so are nations. Thus I mused, As on the Inca's pyramid I sat and gazed around. Here, methought, a royal race, To whom a nation bowed, As if they were the sons of Heaven, Came and paid their adoration To the all-o'erseeing sun. And where is now that royal race? Gone, and mingled with the ages That have passed away. Here a countless multitude Of self-made slaves, through weary years, Toiled and built this stately pile. Years on years have rolled away, Since they who built it lived. Still it rears its massy front, And stands unmoved, in proud defiance, 'Gainst the scythe of time And ruin's crumbling hand; While the same winds bleach the bones Of the poor slave, that toiled, And the great king, who bade. ['T was midnight,—and the full round moon] 'T was midnight,—and the full round moon Was riding in the midway heaven, And poured her faint but spotless light Around the pillow where he lay. On the tender grass, and half-shut flowers, That closed their leaves against the nightly air, The dews, that hung in falling drops, Sparkled with a feeble ray. Sleep poured out her poppy dews, And spread her gauzy mantle o'er him; Like an infant in its cradle, There in innocence he lay, Unconscious of impending harm. Sudden from the ground he starts, And feels it rock beneath his feet, And like the ocean roll. From the north, a growling sound Rushes on his ear. Louder, louder, on it comes, Like the never-ending din Of some wide waterfall, That in the desert pours its ceaseless flood; Or like the roar of ocean When the tempest rages, And on a reef of broken rocks The billows chafing, bursting, foam; Or like the rush of myriad horsemen When to conflict fierce they ride, And 'neath the thundering tramp Quivers the embattled plain. Never ending, still increasing, On it comes, and now beneath him Bellows like the groans of hell: Instant to the ground he falls, And long entranced is lost. Hark! the volcan's thunder Rolling o'er the hills. As at midnight, when the storm Rears its front in Heaven, And sheds a thicker darkness o'er the gloom, Bursts the thunderbolt, And shakes the solid ground: So the volcan's thunder rolls. See the lightning's flash Quivering in the sky. Long red streams of flaring light Rise and lick the stars. From the crater's mouth Rolls the fiery flood: Down the rocks it sweeps its way, And the ice of ages In an instant melts, And bursts a torrent to the plains below. Slower rolls the fiery flood,— From cliff to cliff it tumbles, And like the mingled roar of thousand cataracts, Deeper, deeper strikes the ear. Hast thou seen Niobe's statue Stand in speechless agony, With eye upraised, and clasped hand, As if to curse the bolt of Heaven? So Atalpa stood. The night draws on, And closer o'er the wave Her sombre curtain spreads. The dark-blue Heaven swells o'er the sea, And rests its pillars on the tossing deep. The star of evening Has lit its lamp, And, hanging o'er the western wave, Sparkles upon the foam below. How calmly steal the winds along the main, And heave the water round the cleaving prow! The sail swells lightly overhead, And the streamer scarcely flutters; all is still, But the petrel, as he circles round, And skims the wave with snowy wing. 'T is midnight, and the moon Has lit her lamp in heaven. Around her silver throne The twinkling stars grow pale, So bright she pours her beams. Below her, o'er the sea, Spread like a floor of glass Unruffled by the winds, Her image travels on. As the mariner looks at the wake of the ship, He sees a long track of light behind, And the sparkling foam a world of gems. I hear the voice of mirth, The song of love, and the flute's soft note Floating o'er the wave. A white sail steers its course against the moon And seems a sheet of snow. Beneath its shade the music breathes,— 'T is the ship of joy that sails. Streamers of silk wave on the topmast, Shining with purple and gold. So light the west wind blows,— The sails flap and the cordage creaks; While, moving to the sound of flutes, The long white oars in order strike, And cut the marble main. The morn is young in heaven, And the light is spread over the mountains; The sky is blue above, And the earth is green below; The mist rolls over the rocks, And curls its light folds in the valley; The grass is wet with dew, A gem is on every twinkling blade; The song of the birds has awaked the sleeper, And he starts on his journey anew. NEW ENGLAND. Hail to the land whereon we tread, Our fondest boast! The sepulchre of mighty dead, The truest hearts that ever bled, Who sleep on glory's brightest bed, A fearless host: No slave is here;—our unchained feet Walk freely, as the waves that beat Our coast. Our fathers crossed the ocean's wave To seek this shore; They left behind the coward slave To welter in his living grave; With hearts unbent, high, steady, brave, They sternly bore Such toils as meaner souls had quelled; But souls like these, such toils impelled To soar. Hail to the morn when first they stood On Bunker's height! And fearless stemmed the invading flood, And wrote our dearest rights in blood, And mowed in ranks the hireling brood, In desperate fight: O, 't was a proud, exulting day, For ev'n our fallen fortunes lay In light. There is no other land like thee, No dearer shore; Thou art the shelter of the free; The home, the port of liberty Thou hast been, and shalt ever be, Till time is o'er. Ere I forget to think upon My land, shall mother curse the son She bore. Thou art the firm, unshaken rock, On which we rest; And rising from thy hardy stock, Thy sons the tyrant's frown shall mock, And slavery's galling chains unlock, And free the oppressed: All, who the wreath of freedom twine, Beneath the shadow of the vine Are blessed. We love thy rude and rocky shore, And here we stand: Let foreign navies hasten o'er, And on our heads their fury pour, And peal their cannon's loudest roar, And storm our land: They still shall find, our lives are given To die for home;—and leant on Heaven Our hand. NAVAL ODE. Our walls are on the sea, And they ride along the wave, Manned with sailors, bold and free, And the lofty and the brave Hoist their flag to the sport of the gale; With an even march they sweep O'er the bosom of the deep, And their order trimly keep, As they sail. Though so gallantly we ride, Yet we do not seek the fight; We have justice on our side, And we battle in our right, For our homes, and our altars, and sires: Then we kindle in our cause, And awhile a solemn pause— When the cannon's iron jaws Spout their fires. We abhor the waste of life, And the massacre of war; We detest the brutal strife In the van of Glory's car; But we never will shrink from the foe: This, when battle's lightning runs Through his horror-speaking guns, And his brazen thunder stuns, He shall know. We have met them on the deep, With Decatur and with Hull, Where our fallen comrades sleep In their glory's proudest full; For our homes we will meet them again: Let their boasted navies frown, As they proudly bear them down; We will conquer, burn, or drown, On the main. We, too, have hearts of oak, And the hour of strife may come, With its hurricane of smoke, Hissing ball and bursting bomb, And the death-shot may launch through our crew; But our spirits feel no dread, And we bear our ship ahead, For we know that honor's bed Is our due. Then come on, ye gallant tars! With your matches in your hand, And parade beneath our stars, With a free and noble stand, As you wait for the moment of death: Hark the word! the foe is nigh, And at once their war-dogs fly, But, with bosoms throbbing high, Yield your breath. Do your duty, gallant boys! And you homeward shall return To partake your country's joys, When the lights of triumph burn, And the warm toast is drank to the brave Then when country calls again, Be your march along the main, And in glory spread her reign O'er the wave. [Thou art endeared to me by all] Thou art endeared to me by all The ties of kindred minds, And thou hast twined my heart in all The chains that beauty binds; The man who could deceive thee, And, when the prize was won, Could ruin, scorn, and leave thee, Must have a heart of stone. For but one look of kindness given By thee, my heart would brave The coldest, darkest frowns of Heaven, The terrors of the grave: O, death cannot affright me, When thou art smiling by; I ask no star to light me, But the sparkle of thine eye. But all thy bloom and loveliness How soon will fade away! Thy beauty and thy comeliness Will moulder into clay: O, when thy charms have taken wing, And all thy light is gone, How fondly still my heart would cling To thee, and thee alone! THE FRENCHMAN'S DARLING. Reseda odorata, the Mignonette. The rose may sparkle in the morn, And blush and brighten on its thorn; The gaudy tulip proudly spread Its glories o'er the enamelled bed; The iris imitate the bow, That sunbeams on a tempest throw; All these may shine around,—but yet I love my darling mignonette. I ask no deep-encrimsoned flower From India's never-fading bower; No lotus, Nymphæa cerulea, the Sacred Lotus. where it closely weaves The Ganges with its azure leaves; I ask no pensive bud of woe, Nyctanthes Arbor-tristis, Night Jessamine. That gives the night its wreath of snow; All these may have a charm,—but yet Thy charm is more, sweet mignonette. No lily, Lilium superbum. that with gold-specked urn Seems like a chandelier to burn, Where wide Savanna's waters flow Beneath a forest bower of snow; Magnolia grandiflora. No palm with bending tufts of fire, No spiced vanilla, I desire; These you may fondly twine,—but yet I fondlier twine my mignonette. The Scot may love his thistle-down, Its prickly leaves, and purple crown; And Erin on her shamrock smile, The beauty of her emerald isle; The holly twine its glossy braid, A starry wreath for Albion's head: We love the modest violette, Viola tricolor, the Pansy Violet;—the flower of Napoleon. And dearer still the mignonette [Adieu! fair flower, though frail] Adieu! fair flower, though frail: I gazed on thee awhile, And thought I saw thee smile, And woo the passing gale; And thou didst shine the while, In early beauty bright, And in thy maiden light Who would have dreamed of guile? The cankerworm will blight Thy colors, now so gay, And they will pass away, Like drops that fall by night, Before the eye of day: It nestles in thy core, And thou wilt charm no more The winds that round thee play; But all thy sweetness o'er, Thy leaves will droop and fall, And darkness spread its pall Where all was bright before. And when thy beauty all Has faded, they will turn Away, and coldly spurn Thy love, and thou wilt call Unnoticed, and wilt mourn, That in the flush of spring, When hope was on the wing, And virtue from her urn Her choicest dews might fling, And drop her richest wave, That thou didst dig thy grave, And barb, for death, a sting. [We met in cheerless hours, my dear] We met in cheerless hours, my dear, When life had waned with me, And all that once had charmed me here Was gone, but only thee, my dear,— Was gone, but only thee. I loved thee with the glow of youth, But with a purer flame; I vowed, before the shrine of truth, To be for aye the same, my dear, To be for aye the same. For youthful passion soon decays, It flashes and it dies; But my fond feeling shone with rays That kindle in the skies, my dear, That kindle in the skies. Thou wert too young to read my heart, Or love the spirit's light; Thou saidst, “Gay boyhood can impart A pleasure doubly bright, my dear, A pleasure doubly bright.” It was the fondness of the eye, That led thy heart away; And not the hues that deeper lie Than boyhood bright and gay, my dear, Than boyhood bright and gay. So farewell, love, for dear to me Thy heart shall be for ever; And though I cannot live with thee, O, I'll forget thee never, dear, O, I'll forget thee never. [O, love was made to mourn] O, love was made to mourn, Its home is not below; While in this being's bourn, It still must weep in woe. Its home is in the skies; A wanderer with men, It turns its longing eyes To find that home again. But there are forms so bright, So fair, they seem its own; They glow, like stars at night, When clouds away have flown. And there we fondly turn, And think, that love's pure fire Will ever brightly burn, The spirit's vestal pyre. But oh! how short the light, How soon it fades away! And all our heart's delight, Enchantments,—where are they? The glow, the bloom, are fled, O, never to return; And hope to heaven has sped, For love was made to mourn. TRANSLATION OF A LATIN ODE. Winter now has flown away, And the snow has left the hills; Spring, with cheek all flushed and gay, Now her urn with fragrance fills. Now the ploughman's heart is high, As he drives his team along, Turning every furrow by To the melody of song. Now the meadow laughs with flowers, And the woods a balsam pour; Zephyrs breathe through rosy bowers, Where they nod along the shore. Now the brook, that lately stole Murmuring in an icy chain, Freshens, as its waters roll, With sweet waves, the grassy plain Now the pastured bullocks drink, Where full rivers kiss their brim; And where poplars crown the brink, Rustic flutes and voices hymn. Now the girls, in festal glee, Garlanded with roses, play; Gathering blossoms, like the bee, Light they sport the summer day. When she thus, on Enna's plain, Crowned with myrtle, chanced to rove, Pluto, from her frighted train, Stole the idol of his love. Fairest Spring! at thy return, Meadows breathe the balm of flowers, And the wheels of day's god burn Brightest in the train of hours. THE SABBATH. A SAPPHIC. Sweet is the morning when the Sabbath-day dawns, And earth and sky spread lovelier before me; When not a breath stirs, in its whispering motion, Garden or forest, Which does not seem to partake in the holy Peace of the pure hearts, where passion slumbers, Care is composed, and the thoughts all awaken Bright with devotion. Sweeter the lark sings on that sunny morning, Livelier the wren chirps round the shingled cottage, Deeper the robin swells his throat, and pours forth Hymns to his Maker. Sweetly the bell sounds far in the distance, Rising and falling with the winds, and rolling Over hill and mountain, like the tones that summon Pure souls to heaven. Sweet comes the music of the rustic voices, When in the oak grove, or the low-browed temple, Hymning and praising Him whose name is Holy, Hearts glow with rapture. Sweet is the clear tone, where the breath of incense, Longings of clean hearts, prayers by pure lips spoken, Swell on the light winds, through the arching branches; Sweet as when organs, In the dark choir of the lofty-vaulted minster, Pour forth the deep stream of harmony, and roll round Pillar and altar, fretted roof and tall arch, Sounds like the echoes Which, in the still night, after storms have beaten Wild on the roof-tree, round the distant mountains, Mellow, but majestic, send on the soothed ear Calmness and slumber. Sweet is the Sabbath, to the heart who loves it, As the day when heaven's gates opened on this dark world, When the King of Glory, mounted on a bright cloud, Conquering ascended. [O Evening! thou art lovely:—in thy dress] O Evening! thou art lovely:—in thy dress Of sober gray I woo thee, when thy star Comes o'er the hazy hills, that rise afar, When tender thoughts upon my spirit press, And with the whispering gales and fanning airs The quiet swelling of my bosom pairs; And by the lake that lieth motionless, Low in the secret hollow, where the shade, By bending elms and drooping willows made, Displays its peaceful canopy, and gives A moving picture to the lymph below, Where float the sapphire sky, the clouds of snow, The evening streaks, and every swarm that lives And murmurs in the dun air, and the leaves That quiver in the breath of night, and shine With slowly gathered drops, and boughs that play, Rising and falling gently, he who grieves For some deep-wounding sorrow, as is mine, In such a lonely shade his head may lay, And on the scented grass and flowers recline, And gaze upon the lingering light of day. [Empress of night! I saw thee through the rack] Empress of night! I saw thee through the rack, That fleeced I have used this word in a new sense, but easily understood, I presume. the face of heaven, careering by, And launch again upon a cloudless sky, A beam of glory setting in thy track; Like vessel in her course along the sea, Now voyaging through islands, now away On the wide ocean, in her liberty Rejoicing; or like falcon on her wing Skirting the mountain shadows, as they fling Gloom o'er the world beneath them, now at play, On broad, exulting pinions, in the clear Blue noon-vault, where nor speck nor mist appear, And bathing in the deepest flood of day;— So seemed thy round, full orb to hold its flight, Ascending proudly to its highest throne, Mellowing the dun obscurity of night, And walking in its majesty alone; Now through its waving veil of white clouds beaming With softer light, now pouring on their snow, Floating like heaps of foam, an iris glow; Now from a narrow rift in glory streaming With columned rays, as when through arches shine Thy beams on some looped wall or broken shrine, That prouder swell in thy uncertain gleaming; And now undimmed, unshrouded, on the high O'erbending vault of sapphire, as an eye Soothing the brow of heaven, it pours abroad Brightness o'er vale and mountain, gilds the rock, Silvers the winding river, tips the wave With flowing amber, where its foam-wreaths lave The ocean's bulwark, seeming to unlock The pure and calm benignity of God. [Star of the dewy morning! from thy sphere] Star of the dewy morning! from thy sphere Of light and purity, before the hue Of dawn has tinged thy lofty throne of blue, Before the purple, gold, and crimson stain The soft transparence of that heavenly plain, Before the warbling birds salute the ear, While yet the hills are dark, before the glow Irradiates yon aerial peak of snow, And paints the floating clouds, and dyes their veil, That with the wind swells, like the ruby sail Of Nautilus, who skims along the deep, Ere yet the mustering winds the mirror sweep;— Star of the dewy morning! by thy ray I love to brush the pearls that gem the lawn, The while I hasten, ere the bars are drawn That close the portals of approaching day, From yonder hill to view the smiling dawn Shine on the living landscape's proud array; And while those flashes from the orient play, Thou sparklest now intensely, now thy beam Scatters a feebler radiance on the stream, And as the sun's bright herald gayly flushes, And from the deep-stained windows of the morn The rosy nymph of light and darkness born In all the glow of youth and beauty blushes, Thy faint and fainter twinkling dies away: So, when through life's chill night we journey on, Following the star-like beacon in the skies, Till, as the long and weary way is done, At once the doors of heaven before us rise, A wave of glory from the Eternal Sun, The beaming welcome of the Holy One, Mingles with Love's angelic harmonies. Bow of the fabled huntress! who on high, Throned in the bright meridian, bend'st thy arch Towards Day's beaming chariot on its march Of triumph o'er this pure autumnal sky, Which, mantled in a soft cerulean dye, Encircles Nature with its crystal dome, And, like the matchless Pantheon of Rome, Shows in its perfect sphere one only eye;— I mark thy silver crescent purely white Inlaying yon sublimest azure, where, Clear and transparent as the viewless air, And like the empyrean pavement bright and fair, Expands the softest tinctured arch of light. Faintly amid this canopy of blue Thy maiden brightness sweetly trembles through The golden glories of the orb of day;— But soon thy sparkling circlet in the west, Then following, as thou now lead'st on the way, Shall glitter on the ocean's glassy breast, And on the mountain's mellow summit play, And, with the star of beauty by thy side, Behind yon waving ridge of cedars glide Serenely to the palace of thy rest. A REVERIE. I saw a neat white cottage by a rill, A limpid rill, that wound along a glade, Curling and flashing to the sun; a shade Of willows brooded over it; a hill, Not distant, heaved its fresh green slope, and smile With daisies and with dandelions; oft I wandered through such meadows when a child, And loved the turf below, the sky aloft, So softly green, so clearly, purely blue; And as the mild wind, breathing odors, flew Serenely through the grass tufts, and the crown Of dandelions filled the fields with down, Or some gay butterfly, on velvet wing, Flitted around me, in the hearty glee Of youth just bursting out of infancy, And nerved with all the buoyancy of Spring; Wild as the courser, when he bounds away, And gives his graceful limbs their freest play, And perks his ears, and waves his flowing tail, His broad mane proudly heaving on the gale, Now stops, now, with keen neigh and flashing eye, Leaps like the winds, and scours and gallops by,— So, in the bloom of early life I flew, Where'er the insect roved, the feather blew, For ever cheated, and for ever still The creature of a wild and reckless will, Pursuing after bees and flowers anew. I saw that neat white cottage, and I thought That was the shelter I so long had sought, And there with one companion I might rest My weary head on humble Quiet's breast; And see the Year come forth, and dress her bowers, And o'er the lattice weave her veil of flowers; And now, in playful wandering down the stream, Follow its mazy bend, and in a dream Of holy musing, on its banks of thyme Reposing, listen to its simple chime, Through glossy pebbles, over pearly shells; And, stealing through the sunny meadow, cull And crown our tresses with the lilies' bells, And with geraniums fill our bosoms full; And then return, and seated by the door, The scarlet woodbine flaunting over head, Recount our gathered stores of Nature o'er, From flower to flower by sweet enchantment led; And then go back to ages past, and dwell With Contemplation in her holy cell; And, turning o'er the treasures of the mind, Talk with the great, the witty, the refined, And kindle with the ardent; smile and laugh With Butler and Cervantes; deeply quaff Rich streams of inspiration from the fount That flowed on Zion and Aonia's mount; Hang on the tender tale with melting eye, Hour after hour unnoticed stealing by; Or with the patriot rising, feel the swell Of indignation heaving in the breast, And weeping go to Marathon and dwell On barrows, where the brave unhonored rest;— And from the kindled altar take the coal, That fires the lip, and animates the soul, And, mounting upwards on a seraph's wing, Break from this feeble tenement of clay, And, wrapt in reveries of glory, spring, Singing and soaring, to eternal day. [Motherless infant, to the quiet sleep] Motherless infant, to the quiet sleep Of early death descending, thou wilt die As others sink in slumber, and wilt lie Erelong within thy narrow grave. To weep For those who fall like thee befits not,—tears Are shed on those whom we have watched for years, Who, in our yielding hearts, have planted deep The rivets of affection. Thou art fair And pure as rock-sprung fountains, where they well Beneath o'erarching roots, and scatter there Light bubbling dews. Pale infant, thou canst tell Of pain, but thou art silent, for thy heart Is calm; Remorse has never barbed a dart To sting and tear thy vitals,—for to thee Regret can never come, and thou wilt part With being as a lock would fall from me. Thine eyes are closed, thy lip is still and pale, Thy cheek is deadly wan, or faintly flushed With hectic gushings; all thy cries are hushed, Thy breath is silent, as the summer gale Stealing through withered roses. Thou wilt die, And never know the thousand ills which wait The fairest and the brightest, and thine eye No bitter tears will scald,—thy early fate Is dealt to thee in mercy; thou wilt go, Unstained, unspotted, to a better state, And though thy scanty pilgrimage below Was weary, often painful, it was free From all those stings which long have tortured me. [Image of calm devotion, on thy brow] Image of calm devotion, on thy brow The peace of heaven is brooding, and thine eye Is lifted to its glories; deeply thou Hast drank of its pure fountain; therefore now Thy thoughts are centred in the world on high. Silently, as the midnight hours steal by, Thy watch is on the firmament,—and there Thou seest the hills of heaven in prospect lie, As on the passing gale the light clouds fly, And heave their fleecy folds, like curls of air, So thin and so transparent is their veil; Or dost thou mark some white-winged angel sail Slowly athwart the moonbeam, shining through His spiritual form in every lovely hue? Or do more gentle thoughts than these prevail, And is there in that fairy sky a bower Sacred to love and friendship, where the heart May all its unchecked tenderness impart, And feel again the bliss of that fond hour, When first affection budded, and its bloom Opened to suns and zephyrs, still and warm, Ere chilled and withered by that coming storm, Of all our brightest hopes the common doom? Young as thou art, thy heart must surely know Bitter and keen-felt sorrows, for the tear Is brimming on thine eyelids, and their flow Has stained thy cheeks. I look, and seem to hear From trembling lips a tone, that winds its way Into my sympathizing heart. How fair Thy soft, cherubic features! they were seen By feeling Fancy in its peopled air, That teems with all of beauty that hath been. Backward in waving ringlets flows thy hair Of auburn glossiness; thy brow of snow, Smoother than sculptured marble, full and high, And crowning with its graceful curve thine eye Pregnant with thought and feeling, and its glow, When kindled, like a blade of tempered steel; Those lips, that move so touchingly, and send Persuasion to the listening youth, and blend In rapid flow their smiles and tremblings,—all Around thy face so Grecian and so holy, That, as I gaze upon its charms, I feel My rising heart swell with the tears that fall In tender but delightful melancholy. Such tears are of a holy kind, that shed Brightness on those who weep them, like the veil Of dewy light, whose liquid lustre throws A clearer tint of beauty on the rose, Or like the folds of morning mist, that sail In iris pomp around the mountain's head. With thy pure spirit, thy enchanted eye Reading the visioned loveliness of air, The bright celestial forms that wander there, And often sweep with sounding pinion by; With thy soft bosom, melting at the tone Of tender, fond entreaty, burning still To reach with tireless step the golden throne That Truth has planted on her holy hill,— With one so fair, so sweet, and yet so high In all her aspirations, I could blend Thought, wish, and feeling,—Time might hasten by, And age invade us, Love could never end. SONNETS. [I. Winter is now around me, and the snow] Winter is now around me, and the snow Has thrown its mantle over herb, tree, flower: The icicle has tapestried the bower, And in a crystal sheet the rivers flow; And mustering from the north, at evening, blow The hollow winds, and through the star-lit hour Shake from the icy wood a rattling shower, That tinkles on the glassy crust below; And Morning rises in a saffron glow, Pouring her splendor through the fretted grove, In tints that round the heart enchantment throw, Like what the Graces in their girdle wove; And shining on the mountain's frosted brow, That o'er the gilded landscape looks afar, Her kindling beams the virgin mantle strow With drops of gold, that twinkle like a star. [II. Its bitterness the heart alone can know] Its bitterness the heart alone can know,— The blight, the death of hope, and love, and fame; The fire that all can dim, and none can tame; Departed peace, which time can ne'er bestow; The tender feelings of unsullied years, When earth and heaven are beautiful and bright, When nothing dims the eye's serenest light, And life is fairer seen through innocent tears. O, who would wear the tedious years away, That hang around us like a rusted chain, Clinging the closer each dull, joyless day, And printing all its links in scars of pain, O, who can feel this bitterness of heart, This death-like chill, that curdles all the soul, This ever-writhing round a venomed dart, Nor keenly wish to reach life's final goal. [III. What bird can sing when storms are in the sky] What bird can sing when storms are in the sky, When flowers and verdure from the turf are gone? How can the nighted traveller carol on When winds are loud, and lightning flashes by? How can the lip smile, when all prospects die, When earth is but one cold and lifeless waste? And how can pleasure brighten up the eye, When hope has, like a lovely night-dream, passed,— When days are lingering onward dark and slow, And suns arise, but brightly shine no more,— When gloom has covered all that charmed below, And nothing lures us on,—when life is o'er? The heart has then no fountain of delight, The eye has then no spirit to illume; A worse than death has withered with its blight All hope's fair visions, and all fancy's bloom. [IV. The blue heaven spreads before me, with its keen] The blue heaven spreads before me, with its keen And countless eyes of brightness,—worlds are there,— The boldest spirit cannot spring and dare The peopled universe, that burns between This earth and Nothing.—Thought can wing its way Swifter than lightning flashes, or the beam That hastens on the pinions of the morn; But quicker than the glowing dart of day It tires and faints along the starry stream, A wave of suns through boundless ether borne.— Though infinite, eternal! yet one power Sits on the Almighty centre, whither tend All worlds and beings from time's natal hour, Till suns and all their satellites shall end. MAID OF YEMEN. Dark maid of Yemen! from the tufted grove Of date-trees, full in bloom, at sunset glowing, And o'er the drifted sand their shadow throwing,— Maid of the flashing eye, that kindles love, Go with me now to yonder myrtle bower, That flings its perfume on the deep-green wave, And, gathering from the desert every flower, Bind in their sweetest links thy willing slave. Bring snowy rings from beds of coffee, twine The myrrh and cassia round my offered arms; O, let the red-rose blend its freshest charms, And all its breathing odors now be thine! Maid of the glossy brow, the swelling cheek Clear as the juice that ripens in the rind Of Granatine, whose locks flow on the wind, Like the light-streaming clouds, that often streak The pure sky of thy country,—maid, whose tone Tells of a heart that beats with keenest thrill, Whose glances burn, like serpent eyes, that kill,— O maid of Yemen! loose thy girded zone, And spread abroad thy beauty, now the hour Of tender thought steals on, and we are met In loneliness and freedom, when the power, That sported erst amid the Grecian isles, Against our hearts his point of flame has set, And, as he twangs his burning bow-string, smiles. FREEDOM. O thou, who dwelt in loftiness, Ere man had learned to fall; Ere penury drank, in bitterness, Its wormwood and its gall; Ere wealth had reared its golden piles Where nations bow the knee, But health, all radiant o'er with smiles, Made man unbent and free;— Thou Spirit! who pervad'st the wild And desert wilderness, But in thy wrath hast never smiled Where crouching thousands press; Who, through the danger and the dread, The high-souled hero bore, Unshook by fear, by glory led, Through battle's deepest roar;— O, thou wilt never come and dwell Where men in cities throng; Where heartless pimps, in triumph, swell, To power, a pæan song: Thou shun'st the base and crawling herd; The desert is thy home; And with the pinions of a bird, Thou only there wilt roam. O Spirit! take me then with thee, Where winds of ocean blow; Till life, replete with ecstasy, To inspiration glow: O, let me wander freely there, Till death my being sever; Then through the brightest fields of air, A Spirit, float for ever. [Give the Warrior Chief his due] Give the Warrior Chief his due, Him who, to his country true, Boldly, at her summons, flew, Fired with gallantry! Him who met the foe in fight, And with death-fires lit the night, Till his valor turned in flight Britain's chivalry. Crown him with the laurel wreath, Hail him with the clarion's breath, Him who, in the face of death, Battled fearlessly. Let the bard a chaplet twine, Deathless gift of song divine, And the hero's name will shine Through eternity. Cherish then the son of song: He shall proudly bear along, High above the meaner throng, Light and Liberty. Let the voice of music rise, Let the painter seek his dyes In the glory of the skies, For the bold and free. Let the rostral trumpet blow, And to Eastern monarchs show How the fires of freedom glow, Fires that cannot die. Then our nation's fame shall thrive, And to endless ages live, For the song and pen can give Immortality. [Hail to the land of the free and the bold] Hail to the land of the free and the bold, Where honor and justice have planted their throne, Where the hearts of the meanest can never be sold, But order and liberty reign there alone! Hail to the souls that can never be slaves, Who boast of the rights they have won by the sword, Who fight for their forefathers' altars and graves, And soar as the eagle who rescued them soared! Hail to the land we have cherished so long,— The soil where the bright tree of liberty grows! May its root deeper sink, and its branches be strong, While the wave of the ocean in majesty flows! Long may we meet and be glad in its shade, Secure from the tempests that madden the world; Its leaves shall be green, and its flowers never fade. And the starred flag, that tops it, be ever unfurled. Hail to the cradle where liberty drew The pure air that freemen alone can inhale! Here the crowd never toiled for the gain of the few, And the palace ne'er shadowed the cot in the vale: We swore on our swords and our hearts to unite, Till the chain should be broken, the slave should be free, And the hands that are daring in battle for right, To welcome as brothers, wherever they be. Then hail to the nations, who wake from the sleep Of a long night of darkness, like giants from wine, To the heroes who rouse in their greatness, and leap To gather the laurels on liberty's shrine! Their fetters are broken, their tyrants are fled, And the hands of the North and the South shall unite To raise, o'er the tombs of the glorious dead, A temple of honor, and crown it with light. [I saw the sun, at the dawning of day] I saw the sun, at the dawning of day, Chasing the mantling mist away, And tinging it over with gold; The clouds that before his face were driven Were rich with the deepest hues of heaven, And in volumes of crimson rolled: The world was blooming and bright and fair, But nor life nor love was moving there. I saw that sun, at his setting hour, Send over the hills an amber shower Of softer and mellower rays; It bronzed the trunks of the moss-grown wood, And bathed their leaves in a golden flood, As he sank in his fullest blaze: The world was dewy and calm and fair, But nor life nor love was moving there. I saw the moon, at the noon of night, Crowning the sky serenely bright, And gilding the waves below; Clear in her beam the white frost shone, As if over the fields were loosely thrown A sparkling sheet of snow: The world was silent and pure and fair, But nor life nor love was moving there. I saw, on her gay and purple wing, The light and laughing spirit of Spring, Strewing the earth with flowers; The leafless shrubs were hung with bloom, And an airy wave of soft perfume Was poured from the budding bowers: The world was smiling and sweet and fair, But nor life nor love was moving there. I saw through the shade of a maple grove, In the light of her youth and beauty, move The fancied queen of my soul; From her bright and quenchless orbs of blue The arrows of thought and feeling flew, And the tears of compassion stole: O, she was the image of all that is fair, And life and love were moving there. [Two flowers were budding on on stem] Two flowers were budding on one stem, Imbued with fragrance, fresh with dew, And bent with many a trickling gem, That trembled as the west wind blew; And softly shone their crimson through That veil of crystal purity, And as the thrush around them flew, He clearer piped his melody. Two fledglings, in a ring-dove's nest, With tender bill, and feeble wing, Sat brooding on their downy breast, And they had just begun to sing, And as they saw their mother bring, With tireless love, the food she bore, They made the woods around them ring The infant note they carolled o'er. I saw, along the ocean, sail Two barks, that flew before the wind; The canvas swelling to the gale, They left a foaming wake behind, And low the bellying sheet inclined, As freshly blew the sweeping blast; But still the pilot kept in mind, There was a peaceful port at last. I saw, along the cloudless sky, Two stars adorn the brow of night; They shone serenely on my eye, With pure and unoffending light; The beam was mellower than bright, Like gems that twinkle in their mine; It soothed and tranquillized the sight, And seemed a spark of love divine. I saw two sisters,—they were one In beauty, sweetness, age, and soul: Their bosom was the stainless throne Where virtue held supreme control, Their hearts were pointed to the pole By God to erring mortals given, The bright, the pure, the happy goal, That waits the fair and good in heaven. [I found thee on an apple-tree] I found thee on an apple-tree, Written on finding a tuft of blossoms, September, 1821,—the consequence of a violent southeast storm, which had destroyed the foliage exposed to it. Poor sickly and untimely flower! 'T is not the time for thee to be A garland to the sunny bower; Thou shouldst have waited for the hour When April dances o'er the plain; Without her soft, refreshing shower, Thy purple leaf is spread in vain. The bough is freshly green around With all the tender hue of May; But short thy stinted being's bound: One wind will blow thy leaves away, One frost will all thy honors lay, And seared and brown thy tint will be, And never on an Autumn's day The fruit will ripen after thee. Sad emblem of the timid mind, The delicate, the shrinking form, The heart too tender, too refined, To dwell in life's unpitying storm: But there shall come a still, a warm, A fragrant, an eternal Spring, Where envy never can deform, Nor power its chill, cold fetter fling. [Sweet, sainted haunt of early days!] Sweet, sainted haunt of early days! Suggested by reading an Ode to Vale Crucis Abbey, by William Stanley Roscoe, Esq. With thee my lingering spirit stays, And muses on the balmy hours, When forth I wandered after showers; When bushy knoll, and meadow green, Were spangled with the dewy sheen, And evening calmly came along, And gave my ear the rustic song. Sweet, sainted haunt! those days are flown, And I am left, to steal alone, In tears, along a foreign shore, And look the boundless ocean o'er For thy dear spot, and all that threw Enchantment on my simple view: But truth has told my heart too well, That joy can never with me dwell; For early hopes and loves are dead, And every charm of home has fled. [I saw, upon a mountain] I have here attempted to imitate a favorite pastoral measure of the Italian and Spanish poets. In this age of terza and ottava rime, of hexameters, sapphics, and anacreontics, I can surely be pardoned for imitating a measure in some degree associated with those of our language in rhyme and accent. I saw, upon a mountain, A violet newly springing, And round the broken rocks a perfume shedding; It grew beside a fountain, Its bubbling water flinging, And down a turfy slope its current spreading, And greenest grass imbedding; There the sunbeams poured their glory, At morn in golden brightness; And many a song of lightness The careless shepherd sung, and many a story He told of love despairing, Himself in all their joy and sorrow sharing. I loved that quiet valley, When sultry noon was firing The cloudless sky, that o'er my head was glowing; And in a cool, dark alley, In solitude retiring, Where bending elms their tufted boughs were throwing, And softest gales were blowing,— There I breathed my bosom's anguish In many a strain of sorrow, And from the dove would borrow Her melancholy tones and dying languish, When with the zephyr blending, That murmurs through the reeds before it bending. In lonely peace reposing, I gazed upon the ocean, That in the distant view was proudly swelling; I lay till day was closing, And with a softer motion The ringdove fluttered round his airy dwelling, Still to his turtle telling The tender love he bore her; And like a fond one sighing, As if his heart was dying, He sat among the boughs that trembled o'er her; The while, in eddies whirling, The mellow brook in day's last light was curling. The wind was faintly sighing, The boughs were lightly dancing, And down its stony bed the brook was chiming; And now the wind was dying, The leaves were dimly glancing, The loaded vine, that o'er the elm was climbing, Still with the light air timing, In a slower curve were waving Its clusters freshly breathing, And with its foliage wreathing, Like hyacinths the early meadow paving, And in the dewy morning With richest hues the grassy plain adorning. The moon was on the ocean; The billows, proudly swelling, Heaved to her light their tops in foamy brightness; With slow, majestic motion, O'er Tethys' coral dwelling They curled their glassy ridge in snowy whiteness, Tossing with downy lightness; And loud and long their roaring, Like peals of distant thunder, Or mountains rent asunder, When high in air the volcan's flame is soaring, Wide o'er the dark waste rolling, Seemed like a knell the sailor's ruin tolling. Through leaves and boughs inwoven, My grassy pillow shading, Her silver orb in broken light was gleaming; Now, where the rock was cloven, Through fleecy vapor wading, Her virgin fire, in deeper distance beaming, In one full flood was streaming: With tender, smeet emotion, My bosom gently swelling, I sought my quiet dwelling, And raised to heaven my heart's intense devotion, Walking beneath the mellow brightness, flowing From countless gems in yon blue ether glowing. [I will go to the grave where my child has gone] I will go to the grave where my child has gone, And strew its turf with flowers; He was my loved and only one, The charm of my lonely hours: O, he was life in its freshest bloom, He cheered me many a day; His smile and his beauty lit my gloom, And chased its night away. Day after day, like an opening flower, His mother's pride he grew; He seemed like an infant germ of power, So bright he met my view: I saw, in his gay, exulting face, The future greatness glow; And I thought his light infantine grace To manhood's might would grow. I read, in every word and smile, The father's look and tone; And I hung on those dear eyes, the while, As when first our hearts were one: So bright a vision could not last, That dear illusion fled; Like a rainbow-cloud away it passed To the cold and voiceless dead. But there is a home where dear ones meet, And blend their innocent love; Where hours of happiness never fleet, In the peaceful world above; Where the links, that bind our souls by death, Shall never be broken more, But a better life, with its quickening breath, Shall every charm restore: Then cease, ye bitter tears, to fall; My heart its grief shall bear, Till I hear, from Heaven, the tender call Of love invite me there. THE CARRIER PIGEON. Come hither, thou beautiful rover, Thou wanderer of earth and of air; Who bearest the sighs of the lover, And bringest him news of his fair: Bend hither thy light-waving pinion, And show me the gloss of thy neck; O, perch on my hand, dearest minion, And turn up thy bright eye, and peck. Here is bread, of the whitest and sweetest, And there is a sip of red wine; Though thy wing is the lightest and fleetest, 'T will be fleeter when nerved by the vine: I have written, on rose-scented paper, With thy wing-quill, a soft billet-doux, I have melted the wax in love's taper, 'T is the color of true hearts, sky-blue. I have fastened it under thy pinion, With a blue ribbon round thy soft neck; So go from me, beautiful minion, While the pure ether shows not a speck. Like a cloud in the dim distance fleeting, Like an arrow, he hurries away: And farther and farther retreating, He is lost in the clear blue of day. [These weeping skies, these weeping skies] These weeping skies, these weeping skies, They weep so much, that I weep too; And every thing, like Mary's eyes, Around, above, below, looks blue. Such days as these will never do, My Muse can never soar again; Her wings are wetted through and through, She tries to fly, but all in vain. Love brought a wreath, a laurel wreath, And it was steeped in fog, not dew; The little urchin drooped beneath, And gladly down his burden threw. “The Sylphs have sent a wreath to you.” He laughed as he his errand told. “What makes it look so very blue?” Says Love, “It 's only touched with mould.” I twined the wreath around my brow, And felt my brain grow numb and chill; If I had worn the wreath till now, My heart had been for ever still. Oh! skies that weep so much will kill The Muses, and their servant, Love; Their home is on the sunny hill, Where naught is blue but heaven above. [Fair breaks the morning on my eye] Fair breaks the morning on my eye, After long days of gloom and sorrow; Bright is the cloud, as it floats on high, Sailing along the purpling sky, Like the sign, at night, of a clear to-morrow. Light blows the wind along the sea, Heaving the wave with peaceful motion; Gayly the mariner carols, free As a heart that is light and strong can be, When afloat, like a bird, on the boundless ocean. Dimmer and dimmer grows the shore, Laid, like a fold, on the water's pillow; Steadily glides, the gale before, The ship, in its fullest canvas, o'er The glassy breast of the rolling billow. Riding along, like a mighty ark, The gallant vessel skims the water, Leaving behind a foaming mark, Like a whale, when he flies before the bark, Impelled in the crimson path of slaughter. O, how delightfully on my eye Comes the clear morn of sunny brightness! Higher and bluer swells the sky, With a swifter wing the gannets fly, And the billow heaves with a purer whiteness. Give me but winds that steadily blow, Sending the ship, like a dart, o'er the ocean; Then shall my life's blood lighter flow, And my eye shall beam with a brighter glow, And my heart shall swell in its deep devotion. Country and friends I leave behind, Flying, on wings, the ocean over: Come, with a fleeter foot, thou wind, And bear me on, till my heart shall find The home that awaits the restless rover. [Now the setting sun is glowing] Now the setting sun is glowing, Far along the golden sea; Many an ocean wave is flowing, Dearest, 'tween thy home and me; To my lonely bosom showing, I shall never meet with thee. Now my heart is madly beating, As I linger on the west, Where the golden sun, retreating, Blazes on the billow's breast; Bright and fair, but oh! as fleeting, Was the smile that made me blest. Now that orb is dimly stealing To his palace in the deep; Homeward now the gannets wheeling O'er the rolling ocean sweep: But in me the pang of feeling Time can never lay asleep. Let me onward, o'er the ocean, Distance cannot cure my ill; Rise, ye waves, in wildest motion, But my heart is throbbing still; Let it burn with full devotion,— Deeper,—it will sooner kill. SONG OF THE REIM-KENNAR. Eagle of the far Northwest! Thou, who bear'st the thunderer's bow, Thou, who com'st with lightning crest, And with eye of swarthy glow; Thou, who lashest with thy wing, Wild in rage, the foaming deep, Till the warring billows spring, And the upturned waters leap; Thou, who send'st thy scream of wrath, Like a nation's dying cry, Sweeping on thy surging path, Like the roar of tempest, by; When thy scream is wild in ire, When thy wing is swift as death, At my bidding, quench thy fire! At my bidding, hush thy breath! Thou hast met the mountain pine,— And the towering wood is low; Thou hast spread those wings of thine,— Ocean steeds their prowess know; When the bark in triumph rides Proudly in its press of sail, Lo! thy pinions lash the tides, And the stoutest seamen quail; Where aloft the tower of might Crowns in pride the cloud-capt rock, There thou bend'st thy maddening flight, And it shivers in the shock; Though the clouds before thee fly, Though thou rulest rock and tower, Thou shalt lay thy fury by, When thou hear'st my spell of power. At the uttering of my spell, Faint and fall the flying deer; Bloodhounds cease their muttered yell, When the mighty sound is near; Then the wild hawks stoop their wing, Then the wolves their howling hush, Then around the magic ring Glaring fiends and goblins rush: Thou, who scorn'st the scream and yell Echoed from the midnight wreck, Sneering with the laugh of hell As the wild waves sweep the deck; Thou, who hear'st, with shouts of glee, Crushing roof and pillar fall,— Thou shalt listen unto me,— Me, who rule and conquer all. From thy fury on the deep, From thy madness on the shore, Where the wailing widows weep Those who sink to rise no more, From the ravage of the wood, From the sweeping of the plain, From the swelling of the flood, Come, and hear my Runic strain. Let thy giant wing be still, Let the ocean cease to roar, Settle on that lonely hill, Dart thy bolt, and flash no more;— Thou, who, from the far Northwest, Scour'st the wild sea in thy course, Fold thy rapid wings in rest, Conquered by my magic force. Eagle of the far Northwest! Thou hast furled thy sweeping sail, Thou hast closed thy wings in rest, For my charm and spell prevail: Now I bid thee steal away, O'er the calmly rolling wave; Go, and till I call thee, stay Slumbering in thy icy cave: Sweet and silent be thy sleep, On the rock beneath the pole; Let thy rest be still and deep, Till thou feel'st my strong control: I can rouse thee with my spell, Bird of might and bird of flame! Then one word thy rage can quell, And thy wildest fury tame. [The wave is resting on the sea] The wave is resting on the sea, Or only ripples into smiles, That curl and twinkle silently Around the cocoa-tufted isles; Beneath the Moro's frowning walls The faintest chime of ocean falls, As if the rolling tempest-swell, Subdued by moonlight's magic spell, Were murmuring its last farewell. And now the distant breath of flutes, Or tinkling of the light guitars, The mellow sound of love, that suits The silent winds and drowsy stars, When each discordant note is still, And all the hum of day at rest, And tender tones more inly thrill The yet unstained and virgin breast,— These sounds, that tell the heart's devotion, Come floating upward from the ocean, As, skimming through the flaky foam, The light canoes are calmly driven By winds, that send them to their home, So soft, they seem the gales of heaven. But yet the reckless pirate keeps His tiger watch, while nature sleeps, And in his thirsting hope unsheathes The sword that glares with sullen flame; With firm-set teeth he sternly breathes His curses on each better name; Careless he stands, prepared to strike Friend, stranger, foe, for gain, alike. As wolves who gather in the wood, And lurk till chance their prey has given, Then, burning in their thirst for blood, With fiendlike yells are madly driven: So cowers the pirate in his cave, Till far away the snowy sail Moves calmly o'er the mirrored wave, And flutters in the dying gale; Then, with a demon swell of heart, He hurries from the guilty shore, And stealing on it, like a dart, He dyes that snowy sail in gore. [There's a valley that lies in the bosom of hills] There's a valley that lies in the bosom of hills, Where the wind ever calmly and silently blows, And a stream, that collects from the mountain its rills, Over pebbles and shells in a clear current flows, Whose waters through meadows go stealing away, Reflecting the willows that grow on their brim, And shun, under evergreen thickets, the day, Where the noon-hours, when brightest, like twilight are dim; Where the brook sleeps as still, in its ebony well, As the hush of a bee in the bell of a flower, Or the life that is waiting to burst from its shell, And charm with its melody meadow and bower; Where the leaves, that are platted and woven above, Shut out every glimpse of the sun and the sky, And the flowers are as pale as a mourner in love, And ever are wet like the lids of her eye; Where sorrow for ever her vigil might keep, And silence be still as the dead in their grave; Where the heart that is rifled and broken might weep, And mingle its tears with the motionless wave. In the shade of a valley so lonely and still, I could live in a quiet and fanciful dream; Not a wish of my heart would go over the hill, But life glide away like the flow of the stream. [I would follow the sun when the north winds arise] I would follow the sun when the north winds arise, And Autumn has taken its blue from the skies; I would go, with the birds and the flowers in their train, Like a sylph, o'er the wide-rolling waves of the main, And seek on a warmer and lovelier shore A home, till the dark storms of winter are o'er. 'T is pleasant to stray in a tropical grove, Where flowers, fruits, and foliage are blended above, Where the sky, as it opens so vividly through, Is pure as a spirit in mantle of blue, Where the wind comes perfumed from the orange and lime, And the myrtle is ever in bloom in that clime, Where the citron its green and its gold ever wears, And the birds are for ever caressing in pairs:— O, 't is pleasant awhile in those groves to remain, Till Spring comes to visit and charm us again. But I never could stay when the winter has fled, And the flowers of the valley awake from the dead, When April has moistened the earth with its shower, And May is enamelling meadow and bower, When the woods are in leaf, and the orchards are blooming, And the hill in the gray mist of morning is looming, When the air is as sweet from the pear-tree and clover, As a wind that has travelled rich Araby over, When the thickets are living with music and wooing, And the light wings of swallows their mates are pursuing:— O, when mountain birds call me, I cannot remain, So away to the land of my fathers again! THE PIRATE LOVER. Thou hast gone from thy lover, Thou lord of the sea! The illusion is over, That bound me to thee; I cannot regret thee, Though dearest thou wert, Nor can I forget thee, Thou lord of my heart! I loved thee too deeply To hate thee and live; I am blind to the brightest My country can give; But I cannot behold thee In plunder and gore, And thy Minna can fold thee In fondness no more. Far over the billow Thy black vessel rides; The wave is thy pillow, Thy pathway the tides; Thy cannon are pointed, Thy red flag on high, Thy crew are undaunted, But yet thou must die. I thought thou wert brave As the sea-kings of old; But thy heart is a slave, And a vassal to gold: My faith can be plighted To none but the free; Thy low heart has blighted My fond hopes in thee. I will not upbraid thee; I leave thee to bear The shame thou hast made thee, Its danger and care: As thy banner is streaming Far over the sea, O, my fond heart is dreaming, And breaking for thee. My heart thou hast broken, Thou lord of the wave! Thou hast left me a token To rest in my grave: Though false, mean, and cruel, Thou still must be dear, And thy name, like a jewel, Be treasured up here. THE FAREWELL. Must hearts who love so dearly part, And must they bid adieu? And must those eyes, in weeping, dart Their last and fondest view? How cruel comes the parting day, When we have parted never, And one must wander far away, To come no more for ever! They lived securely in their glen, Like doves they fondly loved, And never had their feet, till then, Beyond their mountains roved; But far away the trumpet calls To danger and to death; How cold and heavy on them falls That trumpet's warning breath! For war is now upon their shores, And he must meet the foe, Must go where battle's thunder roars, And brave men slumber low; Go, where the sleep of death comes on The proudest hearts, who dare To grasp the wreath by valor won, And glory's banquet share. O, bright the wreath the warrior twines! But dark the heart it covers, For like a blasting fire it shines On widowed wives and lovers: How glorious is the front of fight, When first the gun has spoken! But dimly gleams its after light, For many a heart is broken. Yes, they must part, who loved so long, And part for ever too; How many bitter feelings throng Around that last adieu! Their hands are pressed, their bosoms meet, That look—what words can tell? And faint the voice, when they repeat That cold, that wild Farewell. [Let us love while life is young] Let us love while life is young, And the vital stream is glowing; When the heart is newly strung, And the tide of health is flowing. Let us pluck the Paphian rose, When its bud is first unfolding; Ere its withered petals close, In the misty darkness moulding. Pluck it, when the morning dew Twinkles on the new-blown flower, And the vernal sky of blue Opens through the melting shower. Pluck it, when the air is sweet, And the winds no more are chilling; When the loving swallows meet, And the soft-eyed doves are billing. Weave it in a wreath of bloom, Let it bind our hearts together; Now when life is all perfume, Warm and bright as April weather; Now when life is dancing on, Like a brook, where flowers are blowing, Curling upward to the sun, Or in mirrored beauty flowing; Ere those waving locks of jet, By the touch of age, are thinning, While the cheek is blooming yet, And the eye is bright and winning. Love in life's delightful spring,— You will find returning passion; Wait till youth has taken wing,— Love will then be out of fashion. If you have a bosom bright Longer than the form around it, Beauty never will requite Love like that, but only wound it. [Thy charms are all decaying, love] Thy charms are all decaying, love, The smile that once was playing, love, So pure and bright, It seemed but light From day's clear fountain straying, love,— That smile away is stealing, love, Thy lip no more revealing, love, The sweets of soul, That Cupid stole To fill his cup of feeling, love. That lip will shed its sweetness, love, Thy form will lose its fleetness, love, Arrayed no more, As when it wore The snowy veil of neatness, love. O, time is stealing by us, love, And age is drawing nigh us, love; So let me sip Thy dewy lip Before the young hours fly us, love. The rose of youth is blowing, love, The tide of health is flowing, love; Then let me be Entwined to thee, As elms and vines are growing, love. A chain of flowers has twined us, love, And blest the hours shall find us, love; Then heart from heart No more shall part, Till age and death unbind us, love. THE LUNATIC GIRL. 'T was on a moonshine night like this, we took our last farewell; And as he gave his parting kiss, I felt my bosom swell; He said, “Adieu, my Caroline,” but I said not a word; Yet never heart was fond like mine,—how wild that dark bush stirred! The moon was round, the moon was bright, the moon was riding high; It was just such a pleasant night, and he was standing by: The sweet bird sung his roundelay, he mocked me all night long; 'T is winter, and he 's flown away, or I should hear his song. The moon looks down upon the spring,—she cannot melt it though; The pretty bird has spread his wing,—he does not love the snow; The winds blow hard,—they say, at sea, such winds will raise a storm; I wish my love was here by me,—my heart would keep him warm. I have a hat of straw for thee; I wove it, and I wept To think thou wert so far at sea, and I the toy have kept. I made a basket, which I filled with lilies to the brim; But plucking them their beauty killed, and so I thought of him. They say the moon loves such as I,—her love is very cold; She floats so softly through the sky, I 'd take her down and fold My cloak around her snowy face, and warm her on my heart;— O, no! she needs a warmer place!—How could we ever part! What can my heart have done, to make me love so much the moon? My fingers are so cold, they ache,—I shall be frozen soon: I would not love my lover so,—my tears are never dry; I hear him call, and I must go,—and so, sweet moon, good by. [Come to my heart, thou stricken deer!] Come to my heart, thou stricken deer! The world has aimed its shaft at thee; There is a welcome shelter here, There are no enemies with me. Thou art too fair and delicate, To bide the cold and pelting storm: O, fly the world, that can but hate The brighter cheek and fairer form. Fly to my heart, thou mourning dove! And seek a refuge in my nest; I'll fold around my wings of love, And hush thy beating pulse to rest. I heard the death-shot in the wood, I saw the fowler clip thy wing; Thy ruffled wings are dropped with blood, But here no foe a dart shall bring. Come to my home, thou bleeding heart! And trust thy woes to me alone; For thou mayst all thy griefs impart, And I will take them as my own. I have a healing balm for thee, To stanch thy blood, and soothe thy pain; For kindly touched by sympathy, Thy wound shall never bleed again. The world may scorn thee, if they please, But I will dare to love thee still; Beneath these darkly sheltering trees, I'll guard thee safe from every ill. For I have found thee kind and true, A tender heart, a melting soul, And still I see thine eye of blue As brightly and as purely roll. [O Mary, my dearest! though waves roll between us] O Mary, my dearest! though waves roll between us, The light of thy beauty still lives in my heart; Though gone all the bright sunny days, that have seen us Smiles and whispers and glances of feeling impart; Though gone are the hours when the universe brightened, And glowed with the purest effulgence of love, When joy, like the flash of a summer cloud, lightened, And life seemed as sweet as they say 't is above. O Mary, dear Mary! I cannot forget thee, Though coldness hath parted my spirit from thine; For ever the moment of bliss when I met thee Shall live and be bright in this bosom of mine; The smile on thy lip, and the words that were spoken, The glance that revealed me the fire of thy soul, Like a dream of enchantment that cannot be broken, Around me in all their first loveliness roll. O Mary, sweet Mary! O, canst thou forget me, And think, never think, how we looked and we loved? O, wilt thou not bid me return there, and let me Be yet by thy sweetness to ecstasy moved?— O, bid me return,—and my spirit shall fly then, Like doves from the storm and the hawk, to their home, And my heart for no happier dwelling shall sigh then, But cling to thee,—never, ah! never to roam. [Dove of my heart! I've built a nest] Dove of my heart! I've built a nest For thee, and for thy young ones too, Where they may sweetly sleep, caressed Beneath thy warm and downy breast, As infants in their cradles do. I 've bent around a limber vine, To form for thee a cool recess; I'll scatter roses there, and twine Above an arch of eglantine, That all within may charm and bless. And when the frequent falling showers Make green the tender turf in May, I'll go and pluck the young-eyed flowers, Just opening in the lilac bowers, And on thy mossy pillow lay. And when the sky is bright in June, I'll sit within a neighboring shade; And at the silent hour of noon I'll put my mourning voice in tune To sigh around the lonely glade. O, come, thou soft, retiring dove! And sit within my downy nest; I'll spread my sky-blue wings above, Then, in the shadow of my love, Brood o'er thy young ones, and be blest. [She has no heart, but she is fair] She has no heart, but she is fair,— The rose, the lily, can't outvie her; She smiles so sweetly, that the air Seems full of light and beauty nigh her. She has no heart, but yet her face So many hues of youth revealing, With so much liveliness and grace, That on my soul 't is ever stealing. She has no heart, she cannot love, But she can kindle love in mine;— Strange, that the softness of a dove Round such a thing of air can twine. She has no heart,—her eye, though bright, Has not the brightness of the soul; 'T is not the pure and tender light, That love from seraph beauty stole. 'T is but a wild and witching flame, That leads us on awhile through flowers, Then leaves us, lost in grief and shame, To mourn our vain, departed hours. Go then from me,—thou canst not chain A soul whose flight is winged above; Turn not on me thine eye again; Thou hast no heart, thou canst not love. [The winds of the winter are over] The winds of the winter are over, The flowers and the green leaves return; The meadow is mantled in clover, The hillock is scented with fern; The blue-birds are flitting and singing Their love-notes in thicket and tree, But the flowers and the sweet birds are bringing No spring and no beauty to me. My hopes have departed for ever, My vision of true love is o'er, My heart shall awaken—ah! never, There 's a spring to my bosom no more; The roses that crowned me are blighted, The garland I cherished is dead; The faith we had promised and plighted Is broken,—my lover has fled. They saw that my life was decaying, For my cheek lost its bloom, and grew pale; They saw that my spirit was straying, But I told not a word of my tale; Not a whisper revealed my deceiver, Not an ear heard me sigh or complain, For my heart still adored its bereaver, And I hoped I should meet him again. He came,—but another had rifled The troth he had plighted to me; I looked on, and my agony stifled, Though it burned like the sting of a bee. O, the sun is now sinking in billows That roll, o'er the hills, in the west; But morning will shine through the willows, And find me for ever at rest. [The dark cloud is over, the storm flies away] The dark cloud is over, the storm flies away, The sun glances out at the closing of day; The air now is freshened with rain and with dew, And the turf shows a greener and livelier hue; Though day is departing, the birds are awake, And in full burst are merry in forest and brake; The mist hovers over the fountain and rill, And curls in light folds on the slope of the hill; The bright arch of beauty its loveliness throws O'er the cloud, as the west takes the tint of the rose. New fragrance is flowing from garden and bower, The flowers are all urns deeply filled with the shower, And their incense is rising and floating away, To hallow and sweeten the closing of day; The lily, in purer and silkier white, Is gemmed with the tenderest touches of light, The rose shines with deeper carnation, and breathes Softer balm, as the maiden her coronal wreathes, And brighter and clearer the round pearls that drip From its leaflets to blend with the dew of her lip. O, there is not a sweeter and lovelier hour, Than the bright sunny evening that follows a shower! Like a hand o'er the heart-strings in tenderness thrown, It tunes every thought to the mellowest tone; Then the eye flashes keen, though the pressed lip be still, And hand touches hand with a livelier thrill; Then soft words, in whispers of fondness, are flowing, And the cheek with the warm flush of passion is glowing; There is silence and sweetness in earth and in air, And the spirit of love and of beauty is there. [The frenzy of a lover who can tell?] The frenzy of a lover who can tell? The glow and flush of feeling, when the eye Dilates o'er beauty, and the burning sigh Heaves deep, and strong, and frequent, from the swell Of hearts o'erwrought to rapture,—who can give The colors to the canvas, that portray, On cheek, and lip, and brow, the changeful play Of hope, despair, of ecstasy and pain Too keen for common hearts to feel and live, The long, long wish to meet those eyes again, The disappointed hope deferred, till all Is hung around with doubt's funereal pall, And darkness veils the spirit, like the gloom Thrown in embodied blackness from the tomb? O, there are feelings which no tongue hath power To utter, which come o'er him at the hour When looks of kindness flash into his soul, And tones that tell affection greet his ear, And sweet smiles answer, when she leans to hear His whispered heart! O, then their feelings roll Wild as the ocean, when the winds have blown Madly, but now the tempest far has flown, And on the curling foam, and bursting wave, The sun in all his pomp of brightness glows, And stars and flakes of liquid lightning pave The clefted billows, where they rush and rave Around the vessel, as she proudly goes, Leaping impetuous on, from surge to surge, Like coursers whom the calls of battle urge Onward, with quivering bound and flashing eye, To mingle in the thickest fight, and die. [They gazed upon each other. They were young] They gazed upon each other. They were young, In the first bloom of beauty. She was fair:— Around her marble neck her raven hair In flowing curls and waving tresses hung; There was a pensive spirit in her eye, Whose sparkling jet, beneath a falling lid Fringed with its long, dark lashes, vainly hid The fire of love that lit it. She would try To seem light-hearted, but whene'er she met The eye that fixed upon her, darkly set The dawning of her mirth, and deeper glowed The clear carnation of her tender cheek; And though she often strove to smile, and speak Gayly, the quivering lip and accent showed A fire was in her bosom, whose pure flame Not time, nor want, nor force, could quench or tame, But round her heart the torch would ever play, And eat, through hopeless years, her life away. [Beneath the pensive willow's shade] Beneath the pensive willow's shade, As evening melts in yonder sky, In careless ease inglorious laid, My dreaming moments hover by. Why should the mind be racked with care? Why should the bosom beat with pain? Our hopes all end in blank despair, Our strife for power and wealth is vain. They cannot dry one trickling tear, They cannot hush one bursting sigh, They cannot quell the gloomy fear Of death, or bid its phantoms fly. Then all in peace inglorious laid, At dewy evening's quiet dawn, O, let me trace the mellow shade Advancing o'er the silent lawn. Without one wish beyond my lyre, I 'd all my careless hours employ In music, and awake the wire To tones of grief and trills of joy. PARAPHRASE OF ISAIAH XXXIV. The imagery throughout has been adapted as much as possible to Babylon. Wherever a variation from the common translation has been made, the notes to Michaelis's Hebrew Bible have been followed. Come near, ye people, to the Almighty Lord; Come, listen, all ye nations, to his word, And hear the fiat of his sure decree: Let the wide earth re-echo to the sound, The world, and all its fulness, ring around; For what Jehovah utters—that shall be. Against the nations he has bared his wrath; Fury and indignation mark his path; And all their armies backward shrink in dread: Their hosts to one wide slaughter he hath given, And by his sweeping sword their cohorts driven, Shall roll in one deep, bleeding pile of dead. Their corpses heaped upon the battle-field, No friend the rites of sepulture shall yield; There they shall rot, and welter in the sun: The worm shall be their covering, and their shroud The stench that rises in a tainted cloud,— Like rivers from the hills their blood shall run. And all the host of heaven shall waste away, A sooty steam shall dim the light of day, And darkness brood o'er all with raven wing; The sun, the moon, the stars away shall roll, The skies convolving like a folding scroll, And there unmingled Night her veil shall fling. The hosts of heaven shall from their centres rush, And all their frame, in one tremendous crush, With trailing flames to earth its arches bend; As when the vine's sere foliage falling plays, And ripe figs drop in autumn's lonely days, So shall those countless worlds of light descend. The purple of their crime has filled the sky, And stained it with a deep, a guilty die; And there Jehovah bathes his burning sword: High o'er Chaldea's land that falchion waves, A people doomed and destined to their graves; It falls,—urged onward by the avenging Lord. It falls,—and every soul a victim dies; In mangled heaps their weltering corpses rise, The king, the prince, the servant, all are gone: That sword, with slaughter wearied, drips in gore; With clots and hair and brains bespattered o'er, It rests,—the work of vengeance now is done. Scared by the terrors of the Conqueror's eye, Like sheep and goats, a timorous flock, they fly: The sword behind them thirsts and flashes still: It longs on all their carcases to feed, And as the palpitating victims bleed, From the warm stream of life to drink its fill. Armies and peasants, camps and cities, all Doomed to one spreading desolation, fall, Like bulls and lambs before the lion driven: The soaked earth steams a hot and feverish cloud, The gore-fed weeds their crumbling bones enshroud:— Come near, and see the wrath of injured Heaven. 'T is silent, lonely, desolate,—a land Of molten rocks, of white and dazzling sand, Where stifling vapors fill the poisoned air; With pitchy slime its sluggish rivers flow, And lava-torrents heave and boil and glow; Bitumen burns, and sulphur flashes there. The quenchless fire shall redden through the night, And send aloft, by day, a smoky light, And rolling clouds in heavy folds ascend; From age to age, the traveller, on his path, Shuddering shall see that wasted land of wrath, And back with fearful steps his journey bend. Ruin is on that city of renown; Her towers and battlements have thundered down, The engine of the Lord hath laid them low: The busy hum of trade, the slave's employ, The warrior's echoed shout, the glee of joy, Are hushed in that eternal overthrow. The trumpet shall in vain to battle sound; No armed host shall proudly throng around Their captains; all their pomp and power is gone: The courts and chambers, to the Arab's tread, Ring, like the vaulted caverns of the dead, And silence sits upon the monarch's throne. And there the pelican shall build her nest, And feed her young ones from her bleeding breast, And by the bittern's boom the hush be broke; The owlet sit and mourn in every tower, And when the day is dark, and tempests lower, The raven in sepulchral omens croak. On every tumbling wall and mouldering shrine The Lord, the unerring Lord, shall stretch his line, And in eternal ruin thou shalt lie; Sure as the plummet settles to the ground, Thy courts shall echo, with an empty sound, To the scared wanderer, as he hurries by. And thorns shall choke the palace of her kings, The bramble and the nettle twine their stings, And mantle o'er her bulwarks and her walls; The lurking lizard there shall dwell and breed, The ostrich on the tall, rank grass shall feed, That rustling waves in her deserted halls. In the dark watches of the lonely night, In one infernal chorus shall unite The wild-cat's yell, the gaunt hyena's howl; The baboon to his fellow-baboon cry, The wild blast of the desert whistling by Ring with the harpy screaming of the owl. There shall the viper nestle, and shall lay Her filmy eggs, and there her young shall play; There she shall coil, and watch beneath the shade, And on the traveller, darting, fix her sting; And there the vulture fold his sooty wing, Beside his mate in sordid slumber laid. Go read the fatal volume of the Lord; Go listen to his sure, unerring word: “Thou, Babylon, shalt rise in glory—never; But I will sweep my besom over thee, And all thy pomp shall fade, and thou shalt be A desolation and a hiss for ever.” RELIGION. Sweet and soul-composing star Twinkling in the heavens afar,— Who through being's lonely night Guid'st me with unerring light, And though clouds awhile may roll O'er thy brightness and my soul, Soon the vapor flits away, And the world again is day,— Thou, with pure, consoling beam, Shin'st on life's unquiet stream; And thy ray of beauty guides O'er the dark and tossing tides, Rising with a smiling form From the bosom of the storm, Till, the gloom and tempest past, Safe we reach thy home at last. When I weep in grief alone, Every fond endearment flown, When the gay world has no power In this dark and lonely hour, Still thy calm and lovely beam, Bright as morning on a stream, Drops a light upon my breast, Hushing every pulse to rest. Life is poor and faint below; Never can its joy bestow Pleasure on the pure in heart,— They pursue a better part: O'er this dark and turbid sea, Hastening onward after thee, Stayed by calms, by tempests driven, All their hope, their aim is Heaven. [In wisdom God hath made the world] “The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork.” In wisdom God hath made the world, And still upholds its wondrous frame; The planets, in their orbits whirled, Roll round their endless path the same. The same unchanging laws control The suns that sparkle in the skies,— The waves that now in calmness roll, And now in wildest tempest rise. The winds obey his word, and go Where'er his mandate sends them forth; They now in balmy zephyrs flow, Now whistle from the icy North. The rain descends, the fields are green, And smile to catch the falling showers; The clouds are gone, and earth is seen To mourn in summer's scorching hours. Lightnings await his voice, and fly On wings of flame athwart the storm; Whose midnight volume, rolling by, Lifts, like a tower, its giant form. The spring is but his smile of love, The tempest but his angry frown; His music charms us in the grove, And then he pours his torrents down. The dew, the rain, the frost, the snow, And night and day, his power proclaim; And all their varying changes show The hand that guides them still the same. [There is an infant, pillowed sweetly] “Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of Heaven.” There is an infant, pillowed sweetly, Asleep upon its mother's breast; A cloak is wrapped around it neatly, And it is smiling in its rest; A halo seems to hover o'er it, An emanation of the skies, And the glad heart of her who bore it Reads peace around its sleeping eyes. The emblem of angelic spirits, Who live beyond the arching blue, Where every stainless soul inherits Delight, eternal ages through; The same pure light around it flowing, The same soft smile is imaged there, The same bright, burning heart is glowing, As in the forms divinely fair. To all who reach the gate of Heaven, And o'er its starry threshold go, A heart as pure, as soft, is given, It burns with holy feeling so; With love unstained their eye is beaming, Love for their God and all he made; Such, deem I, is the infant dreaming, Upon its tender pillow laid. Be like the infant—pure, unspotted, As fountains bubbling from their spring— Before the sheet of life is blotted, Or Peace, the dove, has taken wing; Be like the infant,—soft and tender, As flowers that just begin to blow; And God will be your kind defender, Where'er you rest, where'er you go. HOLY DYING. Calm is the parting hour, When death with sovereign power Throws o'er the righteous soul his heavy chain: Nor doubt, nor dread attend, While round him loved ones bend; But peace celestial mocks the body's pain. He sees the links of earth Part; and his final birth To perfect holiness, with raptured eye: Behind, a vale of tears, In cloud and shade appears; Before, the heaven-bright fields of promise lie. His friends hang round and weep, While, like an infant's sleep, The chilling lethargy of death steals on; And o'er his eye the glaze Falls, and the spirit's blaze Flashes for once, and all of earth is done. How silent, like the breath Of morning, was that death! No agony nor torturing thought was there: And what a holy smile Plays round those lips the while, And how, like heaven's own arch, that brow is fair! O, may my footsteps tread This path, by virtue led, And God's own day-star, till I sink in dust; And when I lay me down To sleep, O, may the crown Shine on my eye, that circles round the just! S. M. A. M. FISHER. I. We ask no flowers to deck thy tomb; Thy name, in purer light, shall bloom, When every flower of earth is dead, And all that bloom below are fled. To thee the light of mind was given, The centre of thy soul was heaven; In early youth, the spirit came, And wrapped thee in its wings of flame. The lambent light that round thee flowed Rose to its high and bright abode, And bore thy restless eye afar, To read the fate of sun and star. Fain would we think the chain is broke, That bound thy spirit to its yoke; That now no mist of earth can blind Thy bright, thy pure, and perfect mind. Thy grave is on a foreign strand, Thy tomb is in a distant land, No kinsman came, no friend was near, To close thine eye, and deck thy bier. But friends will gather round thy tomb, And long lament thy early doom, And thither Science oft repair, To plant her choicest laurels there. II. The brightest blossom soonest dies, The purest dew will early rise To mingle with the viewless air; The fairest rose will soon decay, The softest beauty pass away, And all be dark and lonely there. The brightest souls are soonest gone, The proudest race is quickest won, And genius finds, in youth, a grave; The hand that sent it from above Recalls it in its fondest love, And takes the choicest gift it gave. Mind cannot linger long below, And keep unstained its virgin snow; Earth will assert its base control: Happy the life that soon is o'er,— Pain ne'er can bow the spirit more, No force can crush the tender soul. A few short years, but oh! how bright With pure, serene and mellow light,— No hour, no moment spent in vain. Better, than base eternity, To live these transient years, like thee, In light, and die without a stain. CARMEN SECULARE. Into the gulf of past eternity Another year, in all its pride, has rolled, And soon its brightest pageantry shall be Lost in the long-forgotten days of old; Oblivion draws around its darkest fold To hide the pomp that millions gazed upon The curfew of departed joys has tolled, Another circle in our life is run, And nearer draws the goal, where all of earth is won. A year has ended,—let the good man pause, And think, for he can think, of all its crime And toil and suffering. Nature has her laws, That will not brook infringement; in all time, All circumstance, all state, in every clime, She holds aloft the same avenging sword; And, sitting on her boundless throne sublime, The vials of her wrath, with justice stored, Shall, in her own good hour, on all that's ill be poured. And kings, who hug themselves in sordid ease, And revel in their vassals' blood and tears, Who grasp at all can sense or passion please, And build their strength on others' wants and fears,— For them, the heaped-up vengeance of long years, Poised like a snow-cliff on a mountain's brow, Wild as the sounding avalanche careers, Or oceans rushing in their stormy flow, Shall bury all their power in one wide overthrow. Revenge may hold her breath awhile, but still The spirit boils within, and soon will burst, Like lavas from their vaults;—the long-checked will Breaks out with deeper fury, fed and nurst By ever-growing outrage, till the worst And reddest scourge of tyranny unbinds The rusted links of cent'ries, which, long cursed But dreaded, now the vassel rends, and finds At once his galled limbs free and chainless as the winds. Sovereigns may band in holy leagues, and lock Their fetters on a continent, which springs To claim its birthright,—they may coldly mock The strivings of young Liberty, as things That are to them but toys to play with;—kings Have long enough made men their play,—the hour When wrath shall wake, and triumph clap her wings Over the broken images of power, Draws nigh, and they who rear the haught crest soon will cower. The dawning year beheld a nation rise, Free in a glorious seeming,—but it fell. Where was the Roman fire? Italian skies Shone over them as purely; and the swell Of that wide gulf, where ancient glories dwell, Rolled with as bright a tint on Baiæ's coast. Though Rome's dark ruins frowned, as by a spell, At once before the German's hireling host They sunk, and, in one hour, forgot their proudest boast. They sunk, but yet in nobler souls lives still A feeling, fetters, swords, can never quell; Brute force may crush the heart, but cannot kill; The mind that thinks, no terrors can compel, But it will speak at length, and boldly tell The world its weakness and its rights; the night, Our race so long has groped through, since man fell From his imagined Eden of delight, Must, will erelong retire from Truth's fast-dawning light. For mind has dared assert its native claim, And bigot rage, and superstitious dread, And priesthood robed in purple, cannot tame Its strong uprisings. Power, with hydra head, On vice and self, as on a Lerne, fed, Awhile may bind the nations to its car: In thousand hearts a Hercules is bred, The fearless champion of a coming war, When Liberty, at last, shall break her dungeon bar, And, in the vigor of her youth, go forth, Unshackled and undaunted, and shall call, With the clear summons of her trump, the North To send its nerved sons on to scale the wall, Whereon the Cross and Crescent shadow all, That cradled glory in the olden time; And sack the Czar's firm bulwarks, wherein stall Slavery, and beastly ignorance, and crime, And sense, that drags its folds in pleasure's foulest slime. And on the sea, whose bright green waves should roll Without the stain of innocent blood, nor bear The burden of rank avarice to the goal Where toil and stripes await it,—where thieves dare Their darkest deeds of rapine,—she will there Ride in her car of vengeance, and proclaim To every plunderer, be it they who bear The ocean's lord, or dogs unknown to fame, That her strong arm shall soon their blood-drunk boasting tame. Go forth, ye navies, o'er the ocean go, Where havoc riots on the pirate's deck, Where steals along the cowering bark of woe, And bid those dens of torture float a wreck; And as you first the Invincible did check, So let him feel the force of Nature's sway. Would they might rouse, who worship at the beck Of Europe's would-be lord, and rend away The veil that hides from Greece the glories of that day, Of which all hearts are proud, the brightest hour In all the round of ages, which will stand A monument of light, the sacred dower Of never-dying truth. The tyrant's hand Awhile may dim the glories of that land, And doom it to be trampled on, but still There we shall image out the Spartan band, There we shall gaze on Freedom's holy hill, And from her kindling founts the cup that fires us fill. Where sleeps the fire that erst in Pylæ burned? Where lurks the spirit of that godlike age? Shall the bright soul for ever rest inurned? Is there no hand to check the Tartar's rage? Shall Turk on light and love and freedom wage A war, that swept whole nations like a flame? Shall Europe never in that cause engage, And wipe from off her shores that blot and shame?— Her feeblest arm might now the glutted vulture tame. But shall we mourn because those fanes are low Where Gods were knelt to, and where lust was right? There was a gladness in the overthrow Of temples, where Religion had no light; And though the Cross still left the land in night, And bound the spirit in as cold a chain, Yet we can still exult, and boldly write, “Idols and idol-worshippers again On lands where Truth has poured her light shall never reign.” There is a twilight dawning on the world, The herald of a full and perfect day, When Liberty's wide flag shall be unfurled, And kings shall bow to her superior sway: Already she is on her august way, And marching upward to her final goal; Nations the warning of her voice obey, Away the clouds of fear and error roll, The chain is broke that bound the thralled and fettered soul. That chain is off a continent, where man Begins anew his being,—where a course, Brighter than ever Greek or Roman ran, Spreads its wide list before him. From a source Unstained and deep, with strong, resistless force The unchecked wave of enterprise rolls on: Hope gilds it o'er with sunbeams; wild and hoarse As storm-lashed oceans, till the plain is won, Then in majestic might its calm, full waters run. Here Liberty shall build her proudest fane, Loftier than snow-topped Andes, and its dome Shall cast a burning brightness o'er the main, And all who seek a purer, calmer home Shall steer their bounding barks across the foam, And furl their sails on Freedom's chosen shore;— Here all that Law has in her choicest tome, And all the climes of Greece and Latium bore, Nature from her full stores around our hearts shall pour. Here shall the energy of mind be shown, In all its widest daring,—naught can check The generous spirit, which away hath thrown The yoke that galls and curbs, the toys that deck; Prescription cannot bow him at her beck, Nor rooted wrong command, nor force control; He is not of the sordid slaves, who reck The statesman's gilded bribe and stinted dole;— In vain corruption woos the high, enlightened soul. We have our sages, who drew down from heaven The bolt that shivers, and the light that warms; Who steered the helm of state, when madly driven It seemed the prey of power and civil storms. We have our heroes, who have met the swarms Of hireling butchers,—back the torrent rolled: Though want and terror took their direst forms, Proud in their simple freedom, sternly bold, They stood through trying years, and kept their last strong-hold. And they were victors, and new light hath risen From them upon the nations,—here they draw The energy that breaks their feudal prison; The light that guides them is our country's law: Too strong its perfect brightness,—when they saw, Maddened they rushed upon their lords, and tore The sceptre from their grasp,—the coward awe Of crown and mitre crushed their hearts no more,— They wildly fed the hate, so long they fiercely bore. They turned upon each other, with an ire Like that of ravening tigers, till their glut Of kindred slaughter quenched the maniac fire, And then again their prison-gate was shut. They grasped at full and perfect freedom, but A stronger bar confined them than before; Fetters of adamantine steel were put Around their scarce healed limbs; they dragged through gore, To please a driver's whim, the manacles they wore. Order alone is freedom. We must bend Beneath the sanctity of higher power,— Not transient will, but laws that have no end, Stamped and enforced in being's earliest hour; Sanctioned by time, they are the holy dower Of ages, which from darkness rose to light. Man first was fearless, then he learned to cower, And groped through superstition's Stygian night; Till Science rose, and day shone round him warm and bright. Few are the clear, strong spirits, who can bear To look on Truth in her unclouded blaze; Few are the high, heroic souls, who dare Above the low pursuit of gain to raise Their firm, unbending purpose; few can gaze At Virtue, on her pure and awful throne,— Ah! few can love the ethereal coin she pays,— But they must love it, for the souls alone Who master self can claim our birthright as their own. And Freedom thus, of old, so often fell Before Ambition, when the herd, that crawls Within the crowded haunt, the sordid hell Where luxury and lust have built their walls, Sunk in each vice that deadens and inthralls, Bartered their unprized liberty for gold;— As the pure stream upon the palate palls, When wine has fired the senses, so they sold The rights, that prouder hearts than being dearer hold. There is a twofold liberty in man, The liberty of knowledge and of power. This wanders in the desert with the clan, Or where aloft the Alpine summits tower. Limbs knit with iron cannot stoop or cower, Hands hardened by free toiling cannot bear The burden of a tyrant. He might pour Whole hosts around them; they would nobly dare To guard their desert rocks, or die unconquered there. The other hath its dwelling with the sage;— Where mind is dark, and appetites prevail, Where grovels lust, and brutal passions rage, The breathings of her spirit naught avail. Of cultured states 't is the eternal bale, That vice will grow with wealth and light, and bow The strength that reared the fabric; free hearts quail Before that torrent-wave, whose giant flow Buries a nation's pride in one deep overthrow. Cities have been, and vanished; fanes have sunk, Heaped into shapeless ruin; sands o'erspread Fields that were Edens; millions too have shrunk To a few starving hundreds, or have fled From off the page of being. Now the dead Are the sole habitants of Babylon; Kings, at whose bidding nations toiled and bled, Heroes, who many a field of carnage won, Their names—their boasted names to utter death are done. Such is the fate of empire:—Ashur rose, Where elder thrones and prouder warriors stood; Before the Memphian priest his precepts chose, Men reasoned greatly of the highest good; Before Troy was, or Xanthus rolled in blood, Armies were ranged in battle's dread array; They fought,—their glory withered in its bud; They perished,—with them ceased their tyrant sway; New wars, new heroes came,—their story passed away. They had no bard, and they are dead to fame; But they were brave, were demigods, and yet The spirit which no threat, no force could tame, Which burned the brighter when in conflict met, The sun of ancient valor long has set, Their deeds are swept from memory's teeming page. How soon the renovated race forget The chiefs who ground the nations in their rage!— Some lord must rise to curb and crush in every age. Napoleon, Frederic, Charles, and Cromwell,—these Swept the earth with a besom dipped in fire. They would have kings and nations bend their knees; Theirs was the untamed thirst of something higher, An energy of hope, that could not tire, The love of self to deeds of might sublimed, Ambition wrought to habitudes of ire, Force, reckless force, unchecked, unbent, untimed, An aim to gain a height where power had never climbed. They sought they knew not what,—they set no bound To their wide-clenching grasp,—their longing grew, As grew their empire,—keenly, as the hound Catches the deer-track in the morning dew, They snuffed the scent of conquest,—victory threw Her laurels at their feet,—awhile they gave Blood to the earth like water,—madly flew Their gore-fed eagles. But the wildest wave Breaks and subsides at last;—their end was in the grave. Now they are dust and ashes; other swarms People the ground they wasted, other men Rise to be torn and tossed by other storms. Ambition sleeps a moment in her den To gain new breath, and fire, and strength; but then She blows the embered coals, and they are flame. So it must be, for it hath ever been:— Age rolls on age, and heroes are the same,— The rest, the crowd, the mob, the warlike hunter's game; Food for the sword and cannon, steps to climb Ambition's ladder, brutes, who walk erect, Crouching and gloating on the dust and slime, Where they would creep and wallow, if not checked By biting wants, that man to man connect, The strong necessity of care and toil. Give them their own free scope, and they are wrecked; For master souls their passions will embroil, And tyranny at last will twine them in its coil. [There is a calm lagoon] There is a calm lagoon, Hid in the bosom of a cypress grove; Around deep shade, above The tropic sun pours down the heat of noon. The aged fathers of the forest wave Their giant arms athwart the gloom below, And as the winds in fitful breathing blow, Their rush is like the tide's resounding flow, Or sighs above a maiden's early grave. The long moss hangs its hair, In hoary festoons, on from tree to tree: Lianas, twining there, Ramble around the forest, wild and free; They wave their bowering canopy, Impervious to the faintest ray of light; The softest dew of night Steals never through its mantling tapestry, With blue and starry blossoms spangled o'er; And scarlet fruits, in clusters hung, Low bending, shine around the winding shore, Brighter than aught Hesperian gardens bore, Or Eastern bard, in vine-clad arbor, sung. And on that calm lagoon The water-lilies float; Blue, as the deepest tinctured sky at noon, Or white, as new-fallen mountain snow, Or died in carmine, like the stain Of clouds that on the verge of morning glow, Or golden, as the setting beam, When flashing on the burnished stream, Or veiled in mellow tinctures, like the flow Of milk and wine dissolving, or the plain Of ether, when its starry bow O'erspans the arch of midnight, as a belt, Or like the pearl and topaz, when they melt Their soft reflections in the folded chain, Around the fairest neck of beauty hung,— So sit they calmly in their cups, or swung Along the surface of the rippling wave, Whether the spirits of the air awake, And sport, with glancing pinions, on the lake, Or slumber in their silent cave. [All live and move to the poetic eye.] All live and move to the poetic eye. The winds have voices, and the stars of night Are spirits throned in brightness, keeping watch O'er earth and its inhabitants; the clouds, That gird the sun with glory, are a train, In panoply of gold around him set, To guard his morning and his evening throne. The elements are instruments, employed By unseen hands, to work their sovereign will. They do their bidding;—when the storm goes forth, 'T is but the thunderer's car, whereon he rides, Aloft in triumph, o'er our prostrate heads. Its roar is but the rumbling of his wheels, Its flashes are his arrows, and the folds That curl and heave upon the warring winds, The dust, that rolls beneath his coursers' feet. [I saw, on the top of a mountain high] I saw, on the top of a mountain high, A gem that shone like fire by night; It seemed a star, which had left the sky, And dropped to sleep on the lonely height; I climbed the peak, and I found it soon A lump of ice, in the clear, cold moon. Can you its hidden sense impart? 'T was a cheerful look, and a broken heart. SONNET. Again farewell,—perchance a last adieu! Our meeting was in loneliness and tears, For life looked frowning on my early years, And the bright moments of my youth were few. I longed to meet a bosom, fond and true, Where I might find a heart that beat with mine; I imaged out a beauty all divine, And there the homage of my soul I threw. Vain were those fond illusions! O, as vain The light of fame, that drew my spirit on To climb with patient step the lofty fane, Whereon the brightest wreath of mind is won, And on the proudest height of glory gain The twine of bay, that crowns her chosen one. SONNET. Why have ye lingered on your way so long, Bright visions, who were wont to hear my call, And with the harmony of dance and song Keep round my dreaming couch a festival? Where are ye gone, with all your eyes of light, And where the flowery voice I loved to hear, When, through the silent watches of the night, Ye whispered like an angel in my ear? O, fly not with the rapid wing of time, But with your ancient votary kindly stay; And while the loftier dreams, that rose sublime In years of higher hope, have flown away, O, with the colors of a softer clime, Give your last touches to the dying day. GENIUS SLUMBERING. He sleeps, forgetful of his once bright fame; He has no feeling of the glory gone; He has no eye to catch the mounting flame, That once in transport drew his spirit on; He lies in dull oblivious dreams, nor cares Who the wreathed laurel bears. And yet not all forgotten sleeps he there; There are who still remember how he bore Upward his daring pinions, till the air Seemed living with the crown of light he wore; There are who, now his early sun has set, Nor can, nor will forget. He sleeps,—and yet around the sightless eye, And the pressed lip, a darkened glory plays! Though the high powers in dull oblivion lie, There hovers still the light of other days; Deep in that soul a spirit, not of earth, Still struggles for its birth. He will not sleep for ever, but will rise Fresh to more daring labors:—now, even now, As the close shrouding mist of morning flies, The gathered slumber leaves his lifted brow; From his half-opened eye, in fuller beams, His wakened spirit streams. Yes, he will break his sleep. The spell is gone, The deadly charm departed. See him fling Proudly his fetters by, and hurry on, Keen as the famished eagle darts her wing; The goal is still before him, and the prize Still woos his eager eyes. He rushes forth to conquer:—shall they take, They, who with feebler pace still kept their way, When he forgot the contest—shall they take, Now he renews the race, the victor's bay? Still let them strive,—when he collects his might, He will assert his right. The spirit cannot always sleep in dust, Whose essence is ethereal,—they may try To darken and degrade it,—it may rust Dimly awhile, but cannot wholly die; And when it wakens, it will send its fire Intenser forth, and higher. GREECE, FROM MOUNT HELICON. This is the land of song:—the very mountains Are vocal with invisible minstrelsy; The valleys are the haunt of unseen choirs; The fountains utter music, and the hills Are full of pleasant sounds. Before me stands The temple of the Muses, Helicon, The seat of their divinity, when Greece Stood fair and glorious. It is beautiful, But lonely. Where are now the hallowed shrines, The pillared porches, and the sun-gilt domes, Where ancient Genius offered up his prayers, And kindled, on the altar of his God, A sacrifice, whose odor was divine, And breathed of inspiration?—Fallen, broken, And overgrown with natural wildness, like The intellect that wanders round these ruins, With all its brightness veiled. Now, I have come On a fond poet's pilgrimage; my foot, Wearied, yet eager still, shall find its way Upward to yonder pinnacle of rock, The mountain's sacred summit, by the side Of clear Termessus, where it throws itself, From leap to leap, over the polished stones, And with a sportive wildness hurries on To this secluded nook of bays and roses, This quiet shelter, where the dove of peace Nestles securely, while the distant roar Of violence comes from the open plains, Echoed, but faintly. Pleasant stream, that erst Gave water to the shepherd in old times, When from their cloudy dwelling they descended, Memory's bright daughters, in the silent night, Breathing sweet voices, through the slumbering air, Into his dreaming ear, and told to him Mysteries, which he revealed in harmonies Of measured sounds, high oracles that made The crowd his worshippers, and drew around The woodmen from their caves, to learn of him Kindness and love,—clear rolling stream, whose wave Shines in this gladdening sun like flowing gold Poured from a fretted urn, so smooth the rocks That border thee, and so fantastical Their time-worn hollows,—how it gushes out From some obscure recess, where it lay hidden In clustered vines and feathery foliage, wet With ever-falling dews! and how it bulges In silvery brightness o'er the polished boss Of marble, veined like pictures from the hand Of tasteful art, and yet the very sport Of frolic nature! what a busy din Of tinkling waterfalls! and how it blends With the low murmur of the shaken leaves, And the still hum of bees! These many sounds, These murmuring melodies of many voices, They lap me in oblivion, and I seem Living in dreams. I wonder not the bards Who gathered here in worship, and were filled With the dim feeling of religious awe,— That they imagined, on the shores of Lethe, Such murmurs from the beds of amaranth-flowers, When they went nodding to the odorous winds, That stole from laurel groves and myrtle shades, And crisped the waters as they glided on Over their sands of gold. Such happiness As now I feel in listening to thy music, And gazing on thy sparkling waterfalls, Thy bubbling wells, thy mossy-cinctured lakes, And rose-crowned islands, where the bird and bee Nestle and find their home,—such happiness Elysium well might envy. But I pause, Even on the threshold, when the far ascent Calls me to regions where a loftier power Dwelt on his airy throne. Then be my guide, Wandering Termessus, upward through thy vale, And let me find, beneath the twisted boughs Of these old evergreens, coolness and shade, To make my toil the easier. Darkly rolls Thy current under them, and hollower sounds Thy hidden roar. I just can catch a glimpse Of yon deep pool, dark and mysterious, Sunk in its well of rock; and now from out A tuft of seeded fern I see thee plunge, Tinted with golden green, for there a sunbeam Strays through thy arch of shade. Still as I climb Thy voice goes with me, like the laborer's song, To cheer me; and anon I see thee flashing Through the laburnum thickets, rivalling Their golden flowers; and then thou rushest by Crested with foam, the whiter for the darkness That covers thee; and then I pause and hang Over a broad, smooth mirror, where the sky Looks in, and sees itself, as purely blue, As vast and round, and all its cloudy folds; Their snowy bosses and their iris fringes Are there, and all the circling rocks repeat Their lights and shadows in that vacancy, So clear, it seems but air. Thou rollest on Thus brightly, and for ages thou hast kept This ever-varying, yet eternal way; And like the voice of a divinity Thou pourest thy endless song. But now the rocks That hemmed thee in recede, and, round and fair, The open vale of Aganippe smiles To greet me, as a fond and gentle mistress Welcomes her weary lover, when he comes At evening to her bower. Enchanted vale! Well did the early worshippers of song Choose thee to be their place of pilgrimage, That in thy quiet groves and still recesses They might invoke, with due solemnity, The boon-inspiring power. Here they would come, From the blue islands, and the olive-groves Of Thebes and Athens, and thy laurel-crowned And golden banks, Alpheus, and the shores Of far Ionia, where the wooing air Pants with a softer breath through myrtle groves, And thee, thou emerald gem, amid the foam Of ocean, whence thy guardian goddess rose, To be the world's delight. From every land That heard the echo of those flowing sounds, That dropping honey, which, from eloquent lips, Distilled persuasion, reverently they came, Clad in white robes, and crowned with wreaths of bay, And bearing golden harps and ivory citterns, And round the marble temple, and the fountain Of soft and gentle harmony, uplifted The joyous pæan, through the bright-eyed day Singing, till sunset threw its yellow veil Round thy blue summit, Helicon, and Night Sat on her purple cloud, and dipped her bough Of cypress in Nepenthe, and then waved, Over their leafy beds, oblivion And holy dreams;—and when their God arose, And shook his yellow locks in the blue air, And dropped his shining dews, then they began Anew their solemn chant, and up the heights They moved in measured march, bearing their hymns To Hippocrene and the crowning rocks, Whence they beheld Parnassus, white and bare, Glittering among the clouds, a golden throne Rich with a waste of gems; and, as it rose, Touched with the sun's first blaze, its forked peak Seemed like twin spires of flame, curling and trembling From earth to heaven. They saw,—and then they bowed, And worshipped in their hearts,—their voices paused, Their harps were mute, and fearful silence told, More eloquent than words, their love and awe. 'T was thus of old: now all is desolate, But fair and lovely. 'T is a wilderness Of bush and flower, and over it are hung A few old knotted oaks and untrimmed bays, That, in their careless dress, are like the hearts Of this rude land,—beautiful thoughts run wild,— Courage and tenderness concealed beneath Ungovernable rage and stern revenge. Here is a ruin,—once a temple, now Fallen, shapeless, and o'ergrown,—a mingled pile Of blocks and broken pillars, fretted ceilings And sculptured friezes, moulded cornices, And wreaths and garlands, heaped confusedly, And veiled with clematis and ivy, where, Under their verdurous tufts, the lizard lurks, And serpents cast their coats, or in the sun Lie basking in their burnished mail, and roll Their fascinating eyes. There is a hum Of settling bees, and the quick swallow darts Between two columns, sole amid the wreck Unbroken, with their brief entablature Telling in scattered characters, half worn And eaten out by time, here was the temple Of Pæan and the Muses. But the fountain, Where wells it? It has gathered in a marsh, O'ergrown with rustling reeds and water-lilies, And bordered round with tamarisks and osiers, The favorite haunt of painted flies and reptiles That love the midday sun; and here I trace it, Oozing through tall rank grass and irises From underneath a falling arch. Here flowed The gentle fountain,—here they built a shrine To its peculiar Naiad, where it threw Its bubbling waters from the opening rocks, In shade and coolness. Still it gushes over Through tangled leaves, and still it gives a murmur, That soothes and yet inspires. Methinks I see, Peeping from bosky dells, the nymphs who loved This sylvan hollow. Grecian girls are they, With braided locks twined gracefully around Their ivory foreheads, and their arching brows Pencilled above such eyes, gems, living gems, Dark as deep night, and wild, yet winning quick And darting like a flame; and now and then, Less timidly, they lean from their retreats; And then such lips, cheeks, dimples, necks like swans, And polished arms, colors so bright and clear, Still dripping from their fountains, glancing still With water-drops,—they seem to beckon me, Only to smile and vanish. Happy days, When ye were seen as real, worshipped too With dance and song,—worshipped by youths and maidens Only less bright and fair than deities, Full of high health and buoyant happiness, Creatures of poetry and love. Ye ages! Why have ye borne us downward, till the blood Flows stagnant, like this fountain from its well, 'Mid weeds and thorns? Or has it ever been Thus with the dreamer, Man,—ever in love With an imagined joy? But what is here, Perched on the hill-side? Here a chapel stands, Built of the fragments of the Muses' shrine, And with its humble cross and rude stone altar Telling of other faith and lowlier worship Than that of old. Here are no genial banquets, No songs nor dances. Here the lonely hermit Utters his feeble orisons, and chants His one unvaried hymn. A shadowy elm O'erhangs his cell; and here, upon the turf, Half slumbering, half awake, I muse away The hours of noon. The mountain tops around Sparkle and glow,—a quivering vapor floats Above them, and with strange, mysterious power Lifts them to loftier regions, where they hang Like hot and fiery clouds. How still the air! How motionless the leaves! The only sound Is the perpetual hum of water-flies Above the reedy pool. My brain feels dim, And slumber steals apace, and silently I sink in deep oblivion. Still my fancy Plays with the shapes before my half-shut eyes, And tunes the falling murmur in my ears To music. So I pass away in dreams The sultry hours; and now, the sun descending Behind the loftier summits, I awake, And feel the breezy coolness steal around me, And give me life and joy. I turn myself To the fresh evening air, and let it dry My feverish brow and dripping locks, and twine them In artless curls,—then to my pleasant task, And onward to the summit. Now my way Is by a gentler stream, that tinkles down Over the smooth-worn marbles, hollowed out In semblances of urns, and bowls, and lavers; And then in open pipes lapsing away, Clear as a gush of flowing pearls, and tinged With shifting colors, as it catches hues From the stained rock it kisses, purple, green, And golden,—hues that emulate the dove's Or trembling opal's,—soft and velvet hues Due to the water mosses, silent growth Of centuries, o'er which the hurrying wave Slides with a stiller murmur. Now the mountain, Lifted above the forest region, glows With flowering shrubs, that scatter odorous airs, Sweet as from Eden,—purple heath and balm, And lurking beds of thyme, and bright laburnum, And arbute hung with snowy flowers and fruits Red as a flammant's wing, and spiry grass, Breathing of early May, and calling up Memories of pastoral days, of shepherds lulled By whispering elms, and nymphs with flowing hair, Tressing it in the fountains, bleating flocks Calling their truant lambs, and browsing goats Pendant from bushy rocks, and harmonies Of pipes and flutes and voices, warbling out Unstudied songs, and with alternate verse Singing the sun to setting, while cool airs Came from the west, as if Favonius loved Their minstrelsy, and with the tuneful leaves Went dallying, and woke the slumbering pool To music faint but sweet. Such thoughts are wakened By the low whispering of the evening wind, Through tufts of flowering grass and withered halm, The golden harvest of an earlier year, Still in this happy climate undecayed, Still nodding with its ears. And as I move Thoughtfully on, how populous these flowers With honey-bees! how still their humming sounds O'er all the voiceless mountain, while they gather Nectar from golden cups, and urns of pearl, And homelier vases hidden in their beds Of heath and thyme, vases that breathe perfume, And lurking yet reveal their hiding-place, As if by clouds of incense. There they dart From bloom to bloom, and till the lengthening shadows Fall from the mountain peaks, and stretch away O'er vale and plain, and distant cottages Tell of their evening fires, they ply their task, And then go murmuring to their sheltered hives In cave, or hollow trunk, or straw-roofed shed. O'er which the ivy climbs. Thus whiled away, Time flies apace, till suddenly I pause, And greet the higher fountain, whence uprose The flying steed, that bore to loftier heights The young, aspiring soul. It gushes forth, Sparkling and bright and clear, from out the clefts Of living rocks, and throws at once a stream Full and o'erflowing. How the setting light Tinges it with its hues,—rich, golden hues, As if the God of Song still loved the spring, And smiled as he withdrew! No broken arch Chokes up its way, but from its natural caves At once it bursts to light, and hurrying takes Its journey to the plain. Here all is left Simple and void of art, but where the rock Is graved with moss-grown characters, that tell Of earlier pilgrims, when they came and paid Vows from the heart. Above me swells a throne Of broad, bare rock, and there Apollo sat, With all his train of Muses, and indulged The charm of thought. Here many a poet dreamed, When night was full of stars, that heavenly voices Came from that shadowy summit, and they told The bliss of song. They kindly led him on, Spite of a scornful world, and filled his heart With self-approving joy. Now, as the sun Bends to his ocean couch, and well has neared The far blue mountains, round his holiest shrine In Delphi, upward to that pinnacle My foot must hasten. Let no wandering look Turn from the one bright goal. Even as the pilgrim Goes with his eye fixed on his prophet's tomb, Or where his god is laid, so let me on, Bent to that summit, where retiring day Kindles its latest fires. I now have conquered, And heaven is all above me. Earth below Spreads infinite, and rolls its mountain waves Tumultuously around me. Breathless awe Broods o'er my spirit, and I stand awhile Rapt and absorbed. The magic vision floats Dimly before me, and uncertain lights Flash on my troubled eye, and then a calm, High and uplifted, like the peace of heaven, Steals on my heart, and instantly my thoughts Are fixed and daring. 'T is the land of song,— The home of heroes. O, ye boundless plains, Ye snowy peaks, ye dusky mountains, heaped Like ocean billows, far retiring vales, Blue seas, and gleaming bays, and islands set Like gems in gold! to you I kneel with awe Deep and unfeigned. If I have ever felt The stirring energies of warlike virtue, The sternness of unbending right, the bliss Of high and holy dreams, the charm of beauty, The power of verse and song, only to you Be all the praise. And now ye are before me, Rich with the tints of evening. What an arch Of golden light swells, from the point of setting, Over the Delphian hills! and how it rolls, In dazzling waves, round all the mingled heights That rise between! Yonder my eye can catch Glimpses from out the far Achaian gulf, Waving with flame, and seeming through the depths, That dimly open to them, fiery portals To brighter worlds. But now to calmer scenes, And shadier skies. I trace the silver stream Threading its way, now hidden, now revealed, To the round vale, half up the mountain-side, Then lost in woods, and then in distant windings Stealing along the plain. Yon lower ridge Lies dark in shade; and hidden half in trees, The whitewashed convent, with its gilded cross And humble tower, sends upward through the hushed And vacant air its vesper knoll, by distance Mellowed to music. This is all the sound That tells of life. Down through a gloomy gorge, Walled in by rifted rocks, the vale of Ascra Lies, like a nook withdrawn beyond the reach Of violence; and yet the crescent crowns A minaret, and tells a startling tale Of woe and fear. Beyond, the Theban plain Stretches to airy distance, till it seems Lifted in air,—green corn-fields, olive groves Blue as their heaven, and lakes, and winding rivers, And towns whose white walls catch the amber light, That burns, then dies away, and leaves them pale And glimmering, while a floating vapor spreads From marsh and stream, till all is like a sea, Rolling to Œta, and the Eubœan chain, Stretching, in purple dimness, on the verge Of this unclouded heaven. Far in the east The Ægean twinkles, and its thousand isles Hover in mist, and round the dun horizon Are many floating visions, clouds, or peaks, Tinted with rose. Before me lies a land Hallowed with a peculiar sanctity, The eye of Greece,—a wild of rocks and hills, Lifted in shadowy cones, and deep between Mysterious hollows, once the proud abodes Of Genius and of Power. Now twilight throws Around her softest veil, a purple haze Investing all at hand, and farther on Skyey and faint and dim. Methinks I catch, Through the far opening heights, the Parthenon, And all its circling glories. Salamis Lies on its dusky wave; and farther out Islands and capes, and many a flitting sail White as a sea-bird's wing. The stars are out, And all beneath is dark. The lower hills Float in obscurity, and plain and sea Are blended in one haze. Cyllene still Bears on her snowy crown the rosy blush Of twilight; and thy loftier head, Parnassus, Has not yet lost the glory and the blaze That suit the heaven of song. There let me pause; There fix my latest look. How beautiful, Sublimely beautiful, thou hoverest High in the vacant air! Thou seemest uplifted From all of earth, and like an island floating Away in heaven. How pure the eternal snows That crown thee! yet how rich the golden blaze That flashes from thy peak! how like the rose, The virgin rose, the tints that fade below, Till all is sweetly pale! Are there not harps Warbling above thee? voices, too, attuned To an unearthly song? Methinks I hear them Breathing around me, with a charm and spell, That melt my heart to weeping. It is sad, That song of heaven,—the funeral symphony Of ancient worthies, for the murdered peace And glory of their land. They greet the heroes, Who rise to meet them in these iron times, And hail them as their sons; and yet they weep Their unavailing toil. Is there no hand To grasp the avenging sword, and tear the knife From the assassin? Must these generous hearts Pour out their blood like water, till the flood Of rage and power has swept them from the earth, And buried all their bright and hallowed land In death and darkness? O, forbid it, nations Who bear the name of Christian, and are proud Of light and truth and mercy. Arm ye; take The cross and sword; move to the war of death Stern and devoted; pause not, till the Turk Has lost the power to harm; then give to Greece Her ancient liberty, and ye shall live Immortal, in your fame. THE PARTHENON. This rock was once the seat of pomp and power; Here rest the chiefs of olden time, And here the orator sublime Shed on their willing ears his golden shower. Here stood their temple in its beauty's blaze, When like a thing of light it rose, And proudly on their dazzled foes So brightly beamed, it quelled their daring gaze. Here stood Minerva with her guardian shield, And from her threatening lance Shot such a lightning glance, None dared to try the heaven-protected field. Here Genius, Glory, Piety were shrined, And hence that Spirit flew, Whose wing has hurried through The darkened world, and fired the inglorious mind. THE SUNIAN PALLAS. By Sunium's rock I took my way Along the blue Ægean sea, That bright in golden sunset lay Round the fair islands of the free: A form of more than mortal mould On the high rock sublimely rose; The bosses of her buckler rolled Like eyes of lightning on her foes: I looked,—the blue-eyed goddess there Stood glorious in the evening air. She stood and raised her brazen lance, That glittered like a meteor's beam; Its light below in quivering dance Flashed gayly on the ocean stream: Round her tall casque her plumy crest Shook with a terrible sign of power, And the grim Ægis on her breast Told to the Turk his destined hour: She spake,—and like the rush of flame Her voice in awful murmurs came. “Sons, worthy of your warrior sires! Yours is the cause of earth and heaven; Shame to the heart that faints or tires, Till the last sacrifice is given! Go fearlessly along your path,— It mounts to liberty and fame; Go, with an unrelenting wrath, And conquer till the Turk is tame: When the red fires of battle glare, Remember—I am with ye there. “These rocks that rise so rudely round Were consecrate to me of old; Here the Athenian sternly bound, For rapid fight, his mantle's fold: He saw the Persian tents below; They filled and blackened all the plain: He rushed,—and, like a torrent's flow, Swept them, and hurled them to the main: This was the wrath that made him free, The fearless wrath of Liberty. “What if a cold and coward world Leave ye to work your way alone; Be the new banner never furled Till Liberty is all our own. Tell them we ask no other aid Than our own hearts in such a cause; No, none but Freemen's hands were made To fight and win for equal laws. Go, with a firm, confiding breast,— Go, fight, and win the conqueror's rest.” THE GREEK MOUNTAINEERS. Now bind in myrtle wreaths the avenging sword, Like him who, at the Panathenian games, With the bold heart no tyrant quells nor tames, The bosom of the proud usurper gored. We have a sterner foe to wake our wrath,— Centuries of darkness have not dimmed us quite,— We have the heart to feel, the hand to smite. Wo to the wretch who dares to cross our path! Our souls are gathered to the effort,—free We have been, and we will be, and our sires Shall look from heaven, and see us light the fires On thy eternal altars, Liberty! Though the proud fanes of ancient glory lie Crushed by the hand of havoc and of time, Still tower, with front as lofty and sublime, Yon hoary peaks, the pillars of the sky. There lived the Suliote free, when all below Bowed to the Ottoman,—the Mainote there Wandered as wildly as his mountain air, And dealt at will his vengeance on his foe. These are thy temples, Liberty!—these heights Nursed the first hardy Dorian in his cave; And there, when Sparta sank, the free and brave Hung on the unconquered rocks their beacon lights. There stood thy altars, and the eternal flame Burns round the cloudy summits, with a glow As bright as when it cheered the plains below, And lit the sacred band to death and fame. We too will have our glory,—we will light Our torches in the fire that never dies; And with a terrible and solemn rite Devote us to our country's liberties. We bind our swords in myrtle, and we go To meet the proud oppressor on his way: Let but the tyrant sink beneath the blow, Gladly we die,—our foes can only slay. They cannot rob us of that wreath of fame, The glorious chiefs of ancient Athens bear: O, how they come to meet us in the air, Borne on their chariots and steeds of flame! We hasten to our vengeance and we die,— Wide to the winds our blood, our lives, are given; In the mid-joy of fight they hurry by, Seize us, and bear us to the Patriot's Heaven. THE LAST SONG OF THE GREEK PATRIOT. One last, best effort now! They shall not call us slaves,— These iron necks shall never bow To barter for a hated life, But we will tell, in mortal strife, What wrath a freeman braves: A few short years, and we have known The pride and joy—to live alone. Our ancient land was free; We washed its stains in blood: Again the hymn of Liberty Rose from the high Athenian shrine, And virgin hands did often twine, In the dark olive wood, Their garlands for the youthful brow Who taught the heathen Turk to bow. These have been glorious days: Let come what will, our fame Is like the sun's eternal blaze, And when they tell of Marathon, And all the fields our fathers won, They too shall name Bozzaris, and the few who died, Victims of glory, by his side. The world has told our doom,— 'T is liberty or death! The tree we planted must not bloom, For Turk and Christian—all unite, And royal hands our sentence write, And yet our breath, When trampled by the ruffian herd, Shall never breathe one recreant word. If we must die, then die! And let the foul disgrace Cling to their names eternally, Who, when they had the power to save, Doomed to a dark and bloody grave A high, devoted race. Awhile the sweets of life to know, O God, and then to perish so! But freedom has one shore: Would we could shelter there The tender ones we value more Than life or fame! O generous men! Be with us, as ye long have been, And we will share All the poor fruit of toils and pains,— Our hearts, our lives, perhaps our chains. Come, at this fatal hour, Ye last of high-born souls; Come, when the crushing weight of power Has all but bent our necks to earth; We will not shame our glorious birth; Nor Turk nor Hun controls The heart that holds the Spartan fire, The sacred relic of his sire. We know ye cannot fear, We know that ye are brave,— To us, your very name is dear: O, by that name, and all its light, We bid ye join the murderous fight, To win and save! O, come, if it be only time To fall with us, in death sublime! GRECIAN LIBERTY. Glorious Vision! who art thou, With thy starry crown of light, Like the diadem of night On the Æthiop monarch's brow? And why art thou descending From thy bright Olympian throne, And thy lavish glory lending, Like the ever-rolling sun, To the self-devoted band On the threshold of their land? Few, but hardy, are their ranks, And they never will retire, Though ten thousand on their flanks Hurl a storm of steel and fire,— Though an iron tempest rain Death and darkness, till the day Pass in dim eclipse away,— Though the thunderbolts of war Plough their furrows in the plain, And the echoing mountains bay To the tumult from afar. O, bright and glorious creature, Winged and mailed and armed for fight! Though beautiful in feature, Like a spirit of delight, Yet the arching of thy brow, And thy proud and gallant form, Tell of one who rides the storm, When the sternest warriors bow And the bravest yield their breath At the summoning of death. There thou standest on the mountains, And the sparkle of thy spear, Like a sunbeam on the fountains To the gallant few below, Is a sign of wrath and fear To the blind and brutal foe: Like a beacon, let it blaze Broad and flaring, till it daze All who come with foot profane To this consecrated plain, Where thy pure and perfect shrine Youths and maidens loved to twine With the laurel and the myrtle, And the shadow of thy grove, Haunt of innocence and love, Heard the winged arrows hurtle From the flowery-wreathen bow, With a whisper like the flow Of a brook, that winds afar Underneath the evening star. O, they were happy days, When, reposing in the shade, Elms and vines and poplars made, It was all thy joy to gaze On the races and the dances, Twining hands and burning glances, Where Passion went and came, Like an arrow tipped with flame. Though thou didst often lie With a pleased and placid eye, As thy children took their pleasure, And the merry flute and viol Told, in light and airy measure, All the joys and sports of leisure; Not the less, to meet the trial, Thou wouldst gird thy warlike arms, And with bare and eager blade, On, through dangers and alarms, To the wreath of Victory wade. Thou couldst leave thy pleasant woods, And the harvest of the plain, And along the torrent floods To the frozen mountains climb, Where they reared their fronts sublime; Or, scorning Slavery's chain, Make thy dwelling on the main. From the Dorian rocks and caves, When the gorged and glutted foe Lay in careless ease below, Like an Alpine stream that raves When the autumn rains are pouring, And the pines in mist are towering,— So thou didst rush and sweep To the dark, remorseless deep, With thy fury and thy force, Shield and chariot, man and horse, And thy sword wrought far and wide, Till the land was purified. And now thou dost awake, And thy dream of ages break. From the halls of ice and snow, Whence thy classic rivers flow; From thy palace in the clouds, Where the light of evening runs On the rolling wreath that shrouds The last refuge of thy sons,— Peaks, that never Turk has trod, Where the armed and ardent Klepht Found his shelter, when he left, For a prey to wasting fires, All the temples of his God, And the dwellings of his sires; From thy caverns in the rock, From thy dark and hidden hold, Thou hast nerved thee to the shock, And thy warning shout has rolled,— Height from height has caught the sound, And thy foes in haste retire; Now the tumult rises higher,— 'T is a nation's cry of joy,— “None to ravage and destroy,— Not a foreign foot is found On our consecrated ground.” HELLAS. Land of bards and heroes, hail! Land of gods and godlike men, Thine were hearts that could not quail,— Earth was glorious then; Thine were souls that dared be free, Power, and Fame, and Liberty. In thy best and brightest hour, Thou wert like the sun in heaven; Like the bow that spans the shower, Thou to earth wert given: Nations turned to thee and prayed Thou wouldst fold them in thy shade. Like the infant Hercules, Thou didst spring at once to power, With the energy that frees Millions in an hour: From the wave, the rock, the glen, Freedom called her chosen then. What though thousands fought with one,— Did thy sons draw back in fear? No,—with Ægis like a sun, Pallas hovered near: Wisdom with her diamond shield Guarded well the fatal field. Fair and bright her temple shone, Meet for such divine abode; There in majesty alone, Loftily she trode: Time in vain his bolt has hurled; Still it stands, to awe the world. Thine were all that rouse the spirit From its dim and deathly dreams: O, shall man again inherit Such undying beams? Lend thy kindling breath awhile; Earth shall then in glory smile. Land where every vale and mountain Echoes to immortal strains, Light is round the stream and fountain, Light on all thy plains. Never shall thy glory set; Thou shalt be our beacon yet. Yes,—for now thy sons are calling To the tombs that hold their sires,— One by one their chains are falling,— They have lit their fires: See! from peak to peak they run, Bearing Freedom's signal on. On, from peak to peak, they rush; Wide and far the glory flows; Streams of light unearthly gush From their crown of snows. Hear ye not the warning call? “Shall a nation rise and fall!” No! forbid it, gracious Heaven! Though a world look coldly on; Be the unyielding spirit given,— Be the battle won; Or if hope desert the brave, Be their land their common grave! If they lose the glorious prize, Be thy rocks a nation's tomb,— Man shall sink, no more to rise, If they meet that doom! Come, ye slaves! and read, and fear,— Freedom's last, best hope is here! ODE. FOR THE CELEBRATION AT BUNKER HILL, JUNE 17, 1825. When our patriot fathers met In the dark and trying hour, While the hand of Britain yet Pressed us with its weight of power, Still they dared to tell the foe They were never made for slaves,— Still they bade the nations know They were free as ocean's waves. Yonder is the glorious hill Where their blood was nobly shed,— Never with a firmer will Hearts of freemen beat and bled: Shall the son forget his sire? No,—the admiring world shall see High a pillared tomb aspire, Like a tower of Liberty. Now the arch of empire swells Proud and daring, fixed and strong: While the hand of ruin fells Nations that have flourished long; Loftier the temple springs, Telling on its front sublime, How it scorns the rage of kings, And the wasting tooth of time. From its high and lifted brow, See, it sends a wakening light, Where a world is slumbering now In the shades of eastern night; They shall feel the quickening fire, Rise and run to meet the day, And their hearts shall never tire, Till their chains are rent away. None shall ever rashly dare Lift his hand against this shrine, While its pediment shall bear Names so honored and divine: High above the sacred band, There in light unfading set, Like twin stars of glory, stand Washington and Lafayette. ODE. FOR THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF INDEPENDENCE, JULY 4, 1826. Bring to this high and holy rite A spirit worthy of our sires: Still may their zeal, a guiding light, Inform us with its noblest fires! This the day that saw them rise Bright, in glory, to the skies. Then came they forth, a nation new, To kindle and to warn a world; Then high to heaven their eagle flew; Defiance on their foe they hurled. Britons dared not call them slaves,— Freedom flourished on their graves. Be round us now, a sacred band; Assist us, at the shrine ye raised; Go forth to animate our land, Bright as at first your valor blazed. Fathers, heroes, you we call; May your spirit grace us all. Look down from that sublime abode, Where now ye sit in high repose; Fair are the battle-fields ye trod; No more the tide of slaughter flows. Welcome, Peace! the boon is due, Full and glorious, all to you. A few, an aged few remain, Your brethren in the war of death; Their presence—be it not in vain— It stirs us with a quickening breath. Let us emulate our sires,— Let us cherish long their fires. O, gladly beats the veteran's heart To hail this holiest Jubilee; Theirs was the noblest, proudest part, The toils that set a nation free. Now those generous toils are done; Liberty and peace are won. The flame that warmed and waked their souls, Burns like a beacon on our hills; Through all our favored land it rolls; Bright is the heart it fires and fills. Still the watch-word sounds,—be free: Still 't is Death or Liberty. Then close this high and holy rite With honor to the wise and brave; The men who dared the field of fight Their homes to bless, their land to save. Now to those who fought and fell, Bid the lofty chorus swell. SEA PICTURES. I. Wide to the wind the canvas throw; The moment calls,—away, away! And let the full libation flow To the bright sentinel of day; Fill high the beaker to its brim, And freely pour it in the sparkling sea, That the blue-cinctured galley swim Light as a bird who feels its liberty, And, gladdening in the sun's reviving smile, Floats o'er the water to its osier isle. Now let the sails be widely spread To catch the welcome breath of heaven; The light clouds hurry overhead, By the free mountain breezes driven. We catch it now,—the enlivening air Sounds cheerily amid the crackling sails; Away, away! the wind is fair: Haste on to meet the ever-blowing gales, Where, softly breathing o'er the marble main, They smooth its billows to a liquid plain. II. Spread every sail before the wind; Catch all the breathings of a gale so fair; It steals upon us from behind, Like an invisible spirit through the air: Wide laughs the quickly heaving sea,— Its foam-wreaths twinkle in the sun; Onward the galley hurries, steadily, Like the front horse who knows the victory won, And with his balanced limbs and waving mane Skims, lightly as a dove, the even plain. Yonder the mountains bluely rise, Their foreheads whitened by the smile of heaven; They hang like summer clouds around the skies Soft slumbering in the golden light of even: Yon peaks mount upward from the Elysian vales, Where an eternal spring unfolds Flowers never fading to her quickening gales, And the same tree in blended beauty holds Bud, bloom, and fruitage in its early down, Or brightly peering forth amid its leafy crown. There live the blessed,—a gentle air Steals round them laden with the breath of flowers; All tells of an eternal beauty there; One glorious sunshine gilds the amaranth bowers: No rolling cloud, no gusty rain, No light-winged snow, come rushing from the sky, But shining dews bedrop the spiky plain, Oft twinkling as the sea-wind flutters by; There hangs in middle air the princely palm, Swaying its broad leaves to the whispering gale, Its flower-tufts drooping low, as in a calm Floats the gay pennon round the uncertain sail; There springing from the ocean's breast, Silent and cool, Hesperian breezes rove; They only fan the happy to their rest, And give a pleasing murmur to the grove. III. Steadily breathes the ever-blowing gale; The ship rides proudly on the silent sea; There 's music in the bosom of the sail, Like the soft night-wind in a cypress-tree: Spread smoothly as a temple's marble floor, Heaves onward to the sky the long, long swell; Nothing is heard but the far-uttered roar, Stealing in undulations from the shore, Like the low murmur in a twisted shell. Steadily moves the ship along its way, Sporting its streamers in the tropic sun, While overhead glows a redoubled day, And the still hours in higher circles run, Till evening, in a wreath of glory drest, Comes blushing from the rosy kindling west. There is no visible motion in the air; 'T is one eternal tide for ever going On with the glorious orb that guides it there, Like rivers down to ocean's hollow flowing: The gull wheels round them on his balanced wing Light as a snow-flake calmly floating by, Watching with fixed eye, where with sudden spring The blue-fin leaps to catch the painted fly: So deep a calm broods over all, the crew Slumber at midday on the shaded deck, While the lone pilot safely steers them through Seas that have rarely borne the shattered wreck; Where the ship glides upon the pointed rock So gently, not a sleeper feels the shock, Then, slowly rocking, dips its plunging prow, And rushes headlong to the abyss below. The glory and the beauty of a calm; The sun throned proudly in a deep blue sky; No mist, no stain to dim its Tyrian dye; The air all living with a breathing balm Sent from the scarlet flower-tufts of the palm On the lone rocky islet lifted high; There the flamingo, like a thing of fire, Shoots in a meteor flight, and grandly there Sits the sea-eagle poised in middle air, Rolling his red eye with a monarch's ire. The ocean, as it moves along below, Just strikes the rock, and heaves one foaming wave, Or sends a hollow murmur through the cave, Then softly steals away in silent flow. How high, and yet how soothing, thus to sail Steadily o'er a sheet of glassy green, Curved to its centre like a verdant vale, Where, all her canvas spread to catch the gale, The vessel walks her way like ocean's queen,— Seeming at distance through the crystalline air, Her bright sails fringed with each aerial hue, An iris floating on its ground of blue, Or white-winged spirit calmly hovering there. A FRAGMENT. He long had wound his solitary way Beneath the branches of a forest old, And by his tangled path, in murmuring play, A little river down its waters rolled; Now in a deep and darkling pool it lay; Then from the sun it caught a touch of gold, As through the lightly opening leaves it passed, And gave a cheerful glance that could not last. And so in long and silent wandering He walked beneath the thick inwoven roof Of the long boughs, and leaves low whispering; And nothing sounded near him, but the hoof Of the scared deer, that with a sudden spring Fled his approach, and slyly kept aloof, Watching him with a dark and eager eye, Till he had passed the timid creature by. And so he travelled on till low the sun Had sank, and now looked through the ancient wood, And bronzed the mossy trunks, as one by one They met the flowing of that airy flood, Which seemed on the cool evening wind to run, Till it flowed o'er the thicket where he stood, And gave to every shivering leaf and spray A flush as of the merry morn in May. And now he saw that he had well-nigh passed The weary length of wilderness, for soon, Between two poplars slender as a mast, The sun shone broad, as when he holds at noon The middle sky, and from behind them cast A flash of light, till all the roof was strewn With brightness, like a multitude of stars, As the leaves shifted with the shifting airs. And forth he went, and all before him lay A meadow covered thick with summer flowers, And through that glade the river took its way, Now open, then beneath high-arching bowers, Where the vine hung its clusters, and the bay Shot through their purpling tufts its leafy towers; The wind blew fresher there, and all the grass Bent low its heavy head to let it pass. And all that meadow kindled by the flush Of the red sun, who now behind a hill Dipped his broad circle, and with deepening blush Each moment clipped his rosy fulness, till He vanished quite, and then with sudden rush Wide flashing streams of glory seemed to fill The sky above him, and then mounted higher, 'Till half the heaven was like a sea of fire. And gradually this glow of light grew pale, And only hung on the low-lying cloud; And then a long, dark shadow hid the vale, And covered up its beauty, like a shroud; Then all was dark, but the outspreading sail Of the lone eagle, where he circled proud, Seeming as if he could not bid adieu To his loved sun, and so to meet him flew. And then from out the forest boughs was heard, As if it faintly mourned the dying day, The soft complaining of a twilight bird; And as the visible world all silent lay, So that a bush or thicket hardly stirred, It floated through the darkness far away; Then sinking to a faint and fainter tone, It left the wearied wanderer alone. THE MYTHOLOGY OF GREECE. There was a time, when the o'erhanging sky And the fair earth with its variety, Mountain and valley, continent and sea, Were not alone the unmoving things that lie Slumbering beneath the sun's unclouded eye; But every fountain had its spirit then, That held communion oft with holy men, And frequent from the heavenward mountain came Bright creatures, hovering round on wings of flame, And some mysterious sibyl darkly gave Responses from the dim and hidden cave: Voices were heard waking the silent air, A solemn music echoed from the wood, And often from the bosom of the flood Came forth a sportive Naiad passing fair, The clear drops twinkling in her braided hair; And as the hunter through the forest strayed, Quick-glancing Beauty shot across the glade, Her polished arrow levelled on her bow, Ready to meet the fawn or bounding roe; And often on the mountain-tops the horn Rang round the rocky pinnacles, and played, In lighter echoes, from the checkered shade, Where through the silvery leaves at early morn Stole the slant sunbeams, shedding on the grass Brightness, that quivered with the quivering mass Of thickly arching foliage;—often there Dian and all her troop of girls were seen Dancing by moonlight on the dewy green, When the cool night-wind through the forest blew, And every leaf in tremulous glances flew; And in the cloudless fields of upper air, With coldly pale and melancholy smile The moon looked down on that bright spot, the while, Which in the depth of darkness shone as fair, As in lone southern seas a palmy isle; And when a hunter-boy, who far away Had wandered through the wild-wood from his home, Led by the eagerness of youth to roam, Buried in deep unbroken slumber lay,— Then as the full moon poured her mellow light Full on the mossy pillow where he slept, One more than nymph, in sylvan armor dight, Bent fondly over him, and smiled, and wept. Each lonely spot was hallowed then;—the oak That o'er the village altar hung, would tell Strange hidden things,—the old remembered well, How from its gloom a spirit often spoke. There was not then a fountain or a cave, But had its reverend oracle, and gave Responses to the fearful crowd, who came And called the indwelling deity by name. Then every snowy peak, that lifted high Its shadowy cone to meet the bending sky, Stood like a heaven of loveliness and light; And as the gilt cloud rolled its glory by, Chariots and steeds of flame stood harnessed there, And gods came forth and seized the golden reins, Shook the bright scourge, and through the boundless air Rode over starry fields and azure plains. It was a beautiful and glorious dream, Such as would kindle high the soul of song; The bard who struck his harp to such a theme Gathered new beauty as he moved along: His way was now through wilds and beds of flowers, Rough mountains met him now, and then again Gay valleys hung with vines in woven bowers Led to the bright waves of the purple main. All seemed one bright enchantment then;—but now, Since the long sought for goal of truth is won, Nature stands forth unveiled with cloudless brow, On earth One Spirit of Life, in heaven One Sun. PAINTING. A PERSONIFICATION. One bright sunshiny autumn day, When the leaves were just beginning to fade, I saw a gay and laughing maid Stand by the side of a public way. There she stood erect and tall; Her flowery cheek had caught the dyes Of the earliest dawn, and oh! her eyes, Not a star that shoots or flies, But those dark eyes outshine them all. She stood with a long and slender wand, With a tassel of hair at its pointed tip; And fast as the dews from a forest drip, When a summer shower has bathed the land, So quick a thousand colors came, Darting along like shapes of flame, At every turn of her gliding hand. She gave a form to the bodiless air, And clear as a mirrored sheet it lay; And phantoms would come and pass away, As her magical rod was pointed there. First the shape of a budding rose, Just unfolding its tender leaf; Then, all unbound its virgin zone, Full in its pride and beauty blown, It heavily hangs like a nodding sheaf; And a cloud of perfume around it flows. Then a mingling of vale and hill, Hung around with a woody screen,— O, how alive its quivering green! And there a babbling brook is seen To turn the wheel of a moss-grown mill: There is a clear and glassy pool, And a boy lies idly along its brink, And he drops a pebble to see it sink Down in that depth, so calm and cool; And out from behind a bowering tree There peeps a maiden crowned with flowers; The two are innocent paramours;— At her delicate laugh he turns to see, And then she darts like a frighted fawn That springs away from the turfy lawn, And far in the tangled thicket cowers: So she flies in her haste to hide The blush that mantles her cheek and brow; Then he languidly turns his eye aside To the quiet brook's eternal flow. There you may see a warrior horse, All his trappings are dropped with gold; How his eye sparkles! and oh! how bold, As he springs away in his pride and force. There a dark and keen-eyed Moor Hangs and pulls at his bridle-rein, But all his skill and might are vain; He prances and tosses,—and, hark! away, Bright as the flashing steeds of day, He has broke from his keeper, and flings his mane, Like a streaming meteor, over the plain. Can you not see the creature neigh, In his vapory nostrils panting wide, In his tossing head and his arch of pride, And his rapid glance from side to side, As he stands and beats the echoing ground With a quivering tramp, and sudden bound? Then with a tremble in every limb, And an angry snort, he darts away, And round in a circle he seems to swim, Or bends and turns like a lamb at play. What is that comes from a golden cloud, Floating along in thinnest air? Was there ever a shape so fine and fair? And oh! what wealth of sunny hair Clings around like a glittering shroud. See! she raises a snowy arm, Pure as a flake, ere it leaves the sky. She waves it around with a grace and a charm, And, putting her glossy ringlets by, Shows to the sight a lip and eye. Is it a shape of light and air, A vermeil cloud, and a midnight star, That meet and mingle in glory there, Or one of the winged spirits that fly Like the prophet who rose in his fiery car? No, 't is a being of human mould, Changing with blush, and tear, and smile, Such as the bard in his lonely isle Close to his heart would love to fold. Back she throws her tossing curls, Cheek and brow and neck are bare, Tenderly crimson and purely fair, Like a damask-rose when it first unfurls Its feathery bosom to light and air. Now that world of grace is calm, Sweeter and dearer, but not so bright,— Like a flower when it sends the dew of night Back from its breast in a cloud of balm. See on her lids the gathering tear, Clear as a star in the midnight main, Such she might drop on her mother's bier, Or shed for the youth who has long been dear, When she parts and never may meet again. O, what flashes of glory break From that crystalline fount of love and joy! All her smiles and glances wake, And those opening lips such music make, As rings from the heart of the hunter boy, When he springs through the forest, fleet and proud, And the startled echoes are many and loud, Loud as the burst of a nation's joy, In the rocks that girdle the mountain lake. Now for the touch of a master-hand! See! how she poises and waves her wand, As if in a dream of busy thought She sought for visions and found them not. Now it rises,—and look,—what power Springs to life, as she lifts her rod! Is it a hero, or visible god, Or bard in his rapt and gifted hour? What a lofty and glorious brow, Bent like a temple's towering arch, As if that a wondering world might march To the altar of mind, and kneel and bow; And then what a deep and spirited eye, Quick as a quivering orb of fire, Changing and shifting from love to ire, Like the lights in a summer-evening sky; Then the living and breathing grace Sent from the whole of that magic face, The eloquent play of his lips, the smile Sporting in sunbeams there awhile, Then with the throb of passion pressed Like a shivering leaf that cannot rest,— And still as a lake when it waits a storm, That wraps the mountain's giant form, When they lie in the shade of his awful frown, And his gathered brows are wrinkled down. Such the visions that breathe and live, The playful touch of her wand can give. MUSINGS. My spirit was o'er-wearied with the toil At which the heart revolts; and dark and chill The world was hushed around me, and all life Lay in a deathlike slumber. I alone Was wakeful, and I looked upon the night Beautiful in its cloudless firmament, And in its canopy of myriad stars, With such a sense of sorrow, as when one Deeply enamored gazes on a form Shaped to celestial beauty, with the keen And bitter thought that he can only gaze, And love and worship, but can never be Loved with an equal passion. It was dark, And all the light that looked upon the earth Was in those glorious creatures which afar Shone in their awful grandeur. No sweet moon Lent to the twilight hills a softer day, And threw upon the waving folds of mist, Then curling from the valley, such a tint Of purity, the far-off mountain snow Is dim and faint beside it. It was still; The winds were silent, and the forest boughs Stood hushed without a motion, and their leaves Sent out no more that harmony of sounds By which the unseen ministers of air Utter their low-tuned voices. All was mute, Solemnly mute, but the faint-falling chime Of a small rivulet, that stole away, Buried in tufts of roses, through a grove, That rose high-arching o'er it. This would come At times upon my ear with such sweet sounds Of clear, yet broken melody, my soul Drank in the quiet rapture, and was filled Awhile with a like sweetness, and I seemed A portion of the pure and motionless air, And that the voices of invisible forms, All young and lovely, were enshrined within The compass of my being, and myself Was living with their music. Then it sank Slowly away, and down the flowery bank, That still sent up its offerings of balm, And filled the night with odors wafted far On the calm breathings of the western gale, Which now seemed waking, and at times would wave In a wide fold the drapery of my couch, And shake the wild vine, where it clustered o'er My half-raised casement,—down the flowery bank Reflecting, in its beads of dropping dew Hung on the bending grass, the many eyes That calmly watched in heaven, and looked on earth, As mothers on their infants, when the night Draws near to its meridian, and the pale Fast-dying taper throws its trembling light Full on the innocent slumberer, whose repose Is happiness; whose dreams, if it has dreams, Are all in smiles; and as the day flits by Light-winged, and without tears that are not pure, So is its slumber full of deep delight, And unembittered by the keen regret Of past repented follies, or the fear That darkens in the future,—down the bank The tinkling of the water-fall would glide, And stealing through its canopy of flowers, It then would seem all silent;—yet my ear Followed it, and I hung upon its sounds Still warbling near in fancy, as we gaze Intently on the lips that lately breathed With a most tender music, and still seem To listen to that deep, mysterious flow Of spirit-touching melodies; and when They tremble with her breath, as the full leaves Shake on the rose when the still air awakes, And comes to kiss their dews,—O, then we hear, Though all is silent, such a strain, the heart Beats quickly, and dissolves in tears away. Thus were my feelings softened by the night, Its silence, and its darkness, and the sounds That made that silence deeper, as they came Low-whispering through my window, like the voice Of one who sighs in love, or as the breath Of a pure spirit on its ministry Of comfort to the wretched, or of hope And courage to the failing. Then my thoughts, Now freed from their dark burden, took a flight Into a fonder region, and they went Back to remembered days, when summer smiled, Not only in the blue sky, and the fields Ripe for the harvest, but more sweetly smiled In my young heart, and in its livery dressed All forms that moved around me, and endowed The lovely with a spirit's loveliness, And made them so divinely beautiful, I lived in beauty, and it was the sum Of all my thoughts and feelings, and it threw Its mantle o'er all creatures, and it gave An all-pervading color to my life, And happiness alone was centred in The contemplation of the fairest things; And whether it were forms, or hues, or sounds, Or looks that speak the heart, and shadow out The workings of the faculty within Which images all nature, and anew Shapes it to fresh creations of a port More lofty, and an attitude and air More kindred to its tastes and tendencies,— Whether it was in things that have no life, The sports of Nature's handiwork, or those Eternal statues where the soul of man Stands fixed in immortality,—in flowers Or leaves light-dancing, or in waving woods Poised in luxuriant majesty aloft On the uplifted mountain,—in the wing, That glided through the yielding element In every curve of gracefulness, and swept Proudly the deepest bosom of the air, And rode in light triumphant,—in the forms, That bounding scoured the meadow, tense with life, And nerved to trembling buoyancy,—or those Who are like us in shape, in look and soul, Only more beautiful, and nicely tuned To a far softer harmony:—where'er Nature was in its being, there my eye Drank nothing in but Beauty, and my thoughts Were hidden in a tide of loveliness, And with the delicate motion of young life My senses were one ecstasy, one thrill, Which was not hushed, but heightened in my dreams. I had gone back through darkly-shadowed years, One round of fears and sorrows, and its long And stagnant hours, which seemed for ever fixed In one blank, joyless moment, as if time Had grown eternity, and life could ne'er Reach its long wished-for ending,—those dark years Were passed like waves, when on the broken sea Before the steady wind the vessel glides Swift as a darting eagle, and my thoughts Soon centred in those happy summer days, And they were as realities, and seemed Fairer than any I had seen before; And in the deep intensity of soul, Drawn from all outward things, and poised and bound In this one pure enchantment,—then I formed Visions of paradise, which to have known And felt one fleeting moment, in their full O'erpowering presence, it is more, ah! more Than a whole age of cold and heartless years Spent in one round of animal wants and toils, With far less innocence and true delight Than the keen feelings of the mother-bird Who watches in the thicket o'er her young. [She faded, but in beauty;—not a charm] She faded, but in beauty;—not a charm Of feature or expression left her calm And all-enduring look, that meekly bore Smiles, as in happier years of infancy, Before her roses withered; not a sigh Escaped her, but she seemed to live in hope, That kindled by deferring. She had fed So long upon the higher sympathies, And had so purified her heart's desires, That all to her was spirit; and a veil Of an ethereal tenderness was thrown O'er all that once seemed beautiful; and thus She saw no other world than such as faith Had promised to her second life. No dark And bigot frown o'ershadowed her fair brow, That every day grew purer, till it seemed. Wrought of an angel's essence, and it rose Calm as the cloudless canopy of heaven; And through it came a light, that gave to all, On whom it sweetly shone, her peacefulness And silent hope. Her feelings ever grew Softer, and everything that had a sense Of suffering was pitied, if the winds Blew chillier; and even the falling flowers Were tenderly lamented. She had been A devotee to Nature, and she felt Intensely all its loveliness, and hung Delighted on its wonders, not with dumb And thoughtless ecstasy, but with an eye That read a soul within them, and a voice That hymned the song of gratitude. Her eye Yet stole abroad at evening, when the wind Is silent and the landscape all is still, And flowers are folding up their dewy leaves, And birds are going to their unfledged young Hid in the clustered foliage; when the air Just stirs enough to rock them to repose, And crisp the surface of a silent stream, That flashes in the last departing ray, And circles with its sheet of flowing gold The islet tufted with an iris crown, And the bright purple of the floating leaves, That wave along its current, as the wind Sways them in graceful curves, and slowly turns Their ever-changing mirrors to the sun, Till the pool glitters with their glancing light. She chose this hour of worship, and she knelt, Not to the beautiful creatures she beheld, But to their Common Parent;—though the world Might claim a spirit's awe, it spread so fair, So awful, and so wonderful around, And had such magic hues upon its clouds, And such a tint of love upon its sky, And such a blended harmony of light And shadow, such a host of fairy forms All mellowed by the misty evening air, And lovelier in their softness, that a soul Fresh from its fountain might have worshipped there Such rare and countless beauty. There she bent, Herself the fairest; and she first took in, With an intensest pleasure, all the fair And wondrous forms around her, and then raised Her eyes in adoration. Then her brow Met the clear sky, that was alone as pure, And her keen eyes, that gathered, as her life Grew weaker, more of spirit, till they flashed With her soul's inward movings,—those keen eyes Looked on the stars, that now came faintly forth On their night watching, and they seemed to find, In those ethereal messengers, their home; And there was such an ecstasy, her form Seemed changed to something heavenly, and to rise As a dove rises on a quiet wing, And float into her kindred purity. [She was the first I loved; but years had gone] She was the first I loved; but years had gone Since we had parted. Still the very look, That lent me such enchantment, that I seemed Raised to a higher being, when she sat Sweet in her mildness by me, or with light And flying footstep hastened to my call, And hung upon my words with such a fond And all-confiding earnestness,—that look Still lived in all its light before me, fair As the fresh dress of nature in the calm, Unclouded beauty of an April eve, When the gay twilight ends, and in her full The white-robed planet overtops the hill, And now is far in heaven, and rolls her way In majesty and love, shedding a wave Of soothing influences on them who sit Or walk beneath her all-embracing smile, To the wood-cinctured mountains in their groves Wrapped as in a dark mantle, to the hills Swelled to a sphere of fresh-grown turf, the vales More darkly greened and fairer-flowered, the lakes Sheeted in crystal purity, and all The winding brooks and thread-like rills, that lace The soft and oozy meadows, one calm look, Silent and yet expressive, one far glance Of peace and beauty lending. Thus she seemed, And fairer in my fancy; and where'er My eye roved in its wandering through dark shades, Down close embowered dells, where brooklets steal Their steps o'er glossy pebbles and bright sands,— Where'er my quick eye wandered, she was still The spirit of the beauty it beheld, The living thing that animates the wild, The nymph of the still waters, and the woods Uttering unnumbered whisperings of joy In their soft-rustling leaves, the Deity That consecrates the valley and the lake To her peculiar worship,—so her fair And tranquil features, and her sylph-like form Wrought in a purer world, and o'er-informed With the quick life of feeling,—so she filled Nature with her dear presence, and alone Adorned the rudest landscape, and embraced The desert with an atmosphere of love, And lent my hours of utter solitude A fellowship of fondest thoughts, too bright To be aught else than momentary gleams Of unsubstantial pleasure. So she lived, Still loved and lovely, in my head and heart, The image of my fancy, and the charm That mastered my affections; and the spot Where I had first beheld her innocent, And soft, and spotless features, where I heard The liquid music of her tender voice,— That home of all my wishes still commands My spirit to its centre, and I turn, Wearied and sated, from all other things, To that, and there find quietness. The charm, That hangs around the moment and the place Of our first sudden meeting, lives for ever, And grows in strength and freshness as in years. It cannot die, although thy love is gone, And thou, too, hast forgotten such a thing As I am has a being. Though thine eye Lights on another, dearer one, thy lip Smiles welcome to him, and thy voice is heard Inviting him to happiness,—though I Know this, and even have seen thee hand in hand With one whom I have scorned, as far beneath The scope of my high musings, as a toy Fit to be breathed on by the scented breath Of childish female flattery, as a thing Thy pure and lifted spirit would have deemed Unworthy of communion,—though I see Thy fond eye resting on him, and thy arm Locked tenderly in his, I will not curse, Nor wish thee aught of evil. Those dear hours Shall be thy safety, and the thoughts that dwell With a redeeming fondness there shall throw A veil o'er all thy weaker deeds, and quell All darker feelings, which might rise within My crushed and wounded bosom. I have lived Too long for such a heart as mine, and life Must henceforth be an unprized gift, resigned When Nature shall recall it, as a load That I have long cast from me with a wish To be from earth all free; for if a world Purer and brighter follows, I would know How it is pure and beautiful, and be One of its high inhabitants, and fly On a quick pinion through its cloudless skies, And with the gladness of life's newest spring Would breathe its balm, and wanton round its flowers! [He had a twofold nature, and the one] He had a twofold nature, and the one Was of a higher order, with the souls Who shine along the path of centuries In full and perfect brightness, standing forth In their own loftiness, the beacon-lights By which the world is guided and upborne From its forever downward tendency,— By which it gathers beauty and is formed To the one true refinement, that of thought And chastened feeling,—with such better souls Communing in an equal fellowship, As clear in intellect, as brightly clear In every high conception, and as warm In all emotions, where the heart of man Ascends and widens, and with outspread wings Shadows all human hearts in kindness, lending Its inspiration unto all who feel The glow of its benignity, and dwell Blessed in its steady sunshine. As a rock Lifts its blue forehead from a mountain ridge, And heaves a cloudless summit into heaven, For ever smiling in the softened beam Of an eternal noonday;—to the world Of living things, who watch it far below With a mute look of wonder, as a throne On which the gods are dwelling,—to that world, Soaring in unstained purity, it seems The centre of devotion, and the fane Where the heart bows in awe, and offers up Its deepest adoration:—so these souls Are to the humbler spirits, who go on Mincing along the track they draw, upreared To a commanding loftiness, and set As idols on their pedestals to fill The crowd with wonder. Men are made to bend Before the mighty, and to follow on Submissive where the great may lead,—the great Whose might is not in crowns and palaces, In parchment rolls or blazoned heraldry, But in the power of thought, the energy Of unsupported mind, whose steady will No force can daunt, no tangled path divert From its right-onward purpose. Few are they, And well that they are few, who in the blaze Of genius kindled, like a baleful star, To such a flame as terrifies, and bears Ruin when rushing onward,—who in wrath Are launched along the path where nations go, The highway of the battle, and the field Where power is won, and thrones are emptied. Few The spirits who originate and bend All meaner hearts to wonder and obey, As if their look were death, their word were fate; As if they held the balance and the sword To measure out their happiness, and give To each his stated portion, and avenge All such as dare to murmur. Few are they, And if they were not, earth would be the list Of an eternal conflict, the abode Of ever-warring fiends, who in the train Of a controlling spirit, in the march Of a high conqueror's madness, still athirst For a new field of bloodshed, never tired Of the hot harvest of a passionate war, Where the deep feelings of a nation's rage, And the awakened thoughts of long revenge, Are blended with those passions which arise From the uprooted evils of an age Of ever-growing tyranny, the sense That chains are broken, prison-gates unbarred, And the more galling servitude of mind, The bowing of the spirit to the weight Of a corrupted priesthood, and a court, Which robs to show unto their famished eyes Their earnings, with a splendid mockery Of pageants, and false justice, and the pomp Of a bedizened soldiery, the tools Who forge and link their fetters,—the glad sense That this deep charm is scattered, that this weight Is from their long-bowed shoulders shoved away, And, like the waking from a painful dream, Has left them in the wonder and the joy Of lightness and deliverance,—who go on, As tigers in bloodthirstiness, to slake Their longing in the plunder and the waste Of those who dare not, like themselves, be free, At least who dare not cast the spell aside That binds them to the altar and the throne, And palsies all their vigor, and subdues All their due might of soul; for men know not The force that sleeps within them, till the sound Of a loud warning wakes them from the sleep Of a long night of darkness,—they know not How they may rush upon the coward foe, Whose power was in delusion, and the maze Of falsehoods sanctified by time, and made Sacred by being hallowed to the use Of an unmeaning worship, feared the more, The more it is unmeaning: they know not How they have only to come forth, and say, “Ye shall not be our masters, ye shall not Riot, as ye were wont, in our best blood, And feed upon our toil, and in our sweat Bathe as in perfumed waters”; how at once By firm resolve, and union, and the act That lingers not one moment, they are free, And lords of those who were their lords. O slaves! How long will ye be silent, and await The task-word of a master, and bow down To his unfeeling ministers, and bear His manacles and stripes, and see your loves And little ones torn from you with a dumb And quivering terror, and with fruitless tears Water the bitter bread of toil, and fill The cup of want and sorrow? Ye are strong, And Nature has been kind to you;—your hands Might work an awful vengeance, could your minds Throw off the sottishness of servitude, And concentrate their energies, and feel Intensely their just power and rights. The heart Sinks when want presses on it, and the world Turns from the claims it urges, and will hear None of the earnest words by which it pleads For right and justice only,—then he feels Lost in that darkest wilderness, the crowd, Who know not, care not, when or how he die, Who pass him by as if he were a thing Fit only for the grave, and if he beg One single act of mercy, he has then Resigned all nobler feelings, and come down To such a sense of wretchedness, it weighs Like a cold rock upon him, and the strength And light and action of his soul are gone, And he can only linger on his way, The scorn of those who prosper, and the hate Of his own better spirit, which will seek Death or forgetfulness, its only cure. INSCRIPTION. THE NAIAD OF THE FOUNTAIN. Thou who art wearied with the idle world, Come to my hospitable shade. No sound Shall here disturb thee, but the gentle gush Of a clear-flowing fountain, poured away From a rude, rocky hollow. Overhead My branches weaved with ivy and spring flowers, Moss-rose and woodbine, intercept the day, And make perpetual twilight. Dark below Gushes the ever-spouting spring, and spreads Light dew upon the moss that beds it in, As with a velvet margin. There it lies Clear to its lowest depth, for ever circling With the undulation of the wave below, And with the faint, uninterrupted dash Of the bright crystal curve, that from the rocks Darts with a never-wearied leap away. Enter beneath my hospitable shade, And thou mayest hold communion with the world Of beautiful and pure imaginings, Egerias and Dianas, such as came On the soft moonlight to Endymion, Or such as to the thoughtful Roman king Were all apparent at the silent hour When the sun sank beneath the Iberian wave, And gayly on the Alban mountain's cone Glittered the last departing beam of day. Here thou mayest sit, and, making of the moss A pillow for thee, ponder silently On thy most inward feelings, and control Thy passions to a calm. 'T is wisdom oft To leave the bustle of resort, and seek Silence wherein to meditate and hold Communion with the spirits of better men, And better times,—for so we always deem, When we are over-wearied with the push And jostling of life,—of better times, When our gray ancestors grew purely old, And in the last declining hour of life Had all the innocence of childhood. Fond And soothing is the dream: it quickens us To emulate them, so that we may look Upon their monuments without the blush Of shame to mantle o'er our brows. One hour Of thoughtful solitude may nerve the heart For days of conflict,—girding up its armor To meet the most insidious foe, and lending The courage sprung alone from innocence And good intent. The sun glows overhead Intensely, and the hot and sultry blue, Unclouded and unstained, burns with the blaze That fills the orb of noon: the panting hart Looks for a shelter, and a cool, fresh spring To slake his thirst; the cattle in the brook Lave their hot sides, and underneath the elm, Arching its hanging branches till they dip And kiss the scarcely gliding water, mute And patiently await the coming on Of evening, to go out around the beds Of tufted grass and wild-flowers, there to crop The tender herbage. Wearied as thou art, Come to my woodland hall, and thou wilt find Beneath my canopy of leaf and vine, And on my beds of moss, so soft, they seem Instinct with a quick spirit swelling them To meet thy gentle pressure,—thou wilt find In these, and in the clear and glassy depth Of the round basin, strewed with sands, like snow Drifting and heaving, as the waters gush From their unknown and hidden cave,—the fall Of molten crystal lapsing from the rocks Amid an intertangled mass of fern And cresses, where the sifted fountain flies Away in a light vapory cloud, that fills Freshly my secret bower,—ah! thou wilt find The coolness thou dost long for, and the peace, The silent peace, thy over-wearied heart So long has sought and found not. A FRAGMENT. It is the noon of night,—the stars look faint With their long watching, and the slumbering earth Heaves not a breath,—the very air is still,— The waters hush their voices, and the leaf Hangs silent in the woods. No living thing Looks on the sleep of nature;—I alone Sit like a sentinel, and feel how calm And beautiful is night. I have thus often sat, and deep in thought Outwatched the stars; have seen their fires grow dim, Till the young morning stood upon the hills Wreathed with her dewy roses. I the while Have fed my spirit on the inspiring dreams Of the olden time, and with inquisitive eye Pried in the depths of nature. I have gained Much doubt and little certainty; have lost Youth and its innocent joys, and blanched my hairs, Even in my newest prime. But I have gained a mastery o'er spirits, And can evoke them from their secret caves, Or from the viewless regions of the air, And call them at my bidding. It is so. I have seen glorious creatures throng around me, All loveliness and light. They were not dreams, But were substantial essences, pure forms, That had a look and voice. I spake to them, And they did answer, and their tones were music, Such as they say the harmony of spheres, When the seven orbs move round the golden sun, Hymning too deep and ravishing melodies For mortal ear to listen to, and live. They spake, or rather chanted, and their song Revealed a mystery so high, methought The fountains of all knowledge opened up To meet my gaze, and from their hidden caves Came forth the darkest elements of things, And stood before my presence. I will try Once more the potency of muttered charms, And they shall come in their particular forms, And do as I shall bid them. Spirits! if ye are such, I do command ye, From your most secret hiding-place come forth, And be apparent to me. Spirit of light! From the clear concave of the southern sky, The world of elemental flame; and thou Whose dwelling is the abyss of rolling waters; And thou who lurkest deep in central caves; And thou, light-footed messenger of Heaven, Whose way is in the thin and empty air; I challenge your obedience. Hear ye not? There is no sound to interrupt my voice, And yet I have no answer. Comes there not New brightness from the south? The very air Burns with the living glory. Haste, thou spirit Of most celestial beauty! I have loved thee, And worshipped thee, when thou didst come at morning, Scattering thy light on earth, and kindling heaven, And wakening all to life. Dost thou not come; Or is it only that the moon looks out, In her unstained and virgin loveliness, From the white cloud that dimmed her like a veil? 'T is so. I have dreamed myself to the belief Of my own crowding fancies, and have made The visions of my brain realities. But no! there is a sound on the far waters; A form is rising from their depths, and shedding Brightness on the blue waves. It fades,—and now There is no other light shed on the waters, Than that beneath the moon, or some lone star Deep sunk amid their darkness. Ye have vanished, Dreams of delight and power! Ye gave to me All I have known of joy; for in the sense Of power I dwelt delighted: and though dreams, Baseless and empty dreams, ye had to me The force of strong reality, and made me, In the chill winter of untimely age, Even too happy. O, there was a spell In the belief that some unearthly spirit Held high communion with me, and informed My heart to higher deeds, and gave revealings Of a sublime futurity, and fed Those hopes that lend even to the grave a charm. But I have tried them, and have found them vain. I have sought wisdom, and for this have pored Over the blind imaginings of man, And racked unwilling nature to reveal A few half-hidden laws. In the vain search, Age has come on me, and the proper joys Of youth are lost for ever. O, how gladly Would I resign all I have ever gained, Or hoped to gain, of knowledge or of power, For a few moments of the innocent gladness A young heart feels, when the pure bloom of health Runs o'er the cheek, and all things look of love. THE DEATH OF A CHILD. I sat beside the pillow of a child,— His dying pillow,—and I watched the ebb Of his last fluttering breath. All tranquilly He passed away, and not a murmur came From his white lips. A film crept o'er his eye, But did not all conceal it, and at times The darkness stole away, and he looked out Serenely, with an innocent smile, as if Pleased with an infant's toy; and there was then A very delicate flush upon his cheek, Like the new edging of a damask-rose, When first the bud uncloses. As I watched, I caught at these awakenings better hope, And, yielding to the longing of my heart, Fancied I saw him opening from a trance, And with a gentle effort shaking off The oppression of a dream. A moment more, And the film mantled o'er his eye again, And the faint redness left his faltering lips, And backward to its centre in the heart The crimson current rallied, leaving him Like a chill statue, icy cold and pale. He was my only one, and I had long Loved him for all his innocent playfulness, And his endearing fondness. He would hang Whole days around me, watching all I did, And questioning each particular act, as if He could not rest till he had known the why Of every word and motion. I indulged him, And in that kind indulgence found his love Grow every hour, till I was as his life, And he was more than mine. Well pleased I saw His opening faculties, and well I knew His curious bent betokened better things In a maturer age; but when he seemed Rosy, and full of health, and o'er-informed With life's young buoyancy, a hidden blight Nipped him, and he decayed. He sank away With scarce a visible token, like a breath Of summer wind, when it has spent itself, And blows so faintly, that the feathery leaves Of the mimosa only tell of it, All others resting as if nothing stirred In the wide air. I watched him eagerly, And I could only see that he decayed, And soon must die. With a consenting stillness My heart grew calm, and while his dying breath Stole from his lips so faintly, not a murmur Met the deep listening ear; I felt a power, Too peaceful for an earthly emanation, Come with a tranquillizing influence o'er me And soothe me to the trial. As I looked, The quivering of his lids, that lay like leaves Of alabaster on his darkened eyes, And the small trembling of his parted lips, Curled outward like the margent of a lily, Suddenly died away, and all was still. Life was no more. I knew it, and at once The utter loneliness of sorrow sank Deep, deep within me, and awhile I sat Without a tear. The stream was frozen up And would not flow; but soon relenting nature Gave way, and a full burst of passionate weeping Flowed with a sudden gush, that quite unmanned me, Then ebbing silently, it left me calm. CLOUDS. Ye Clouds, who are the ornament of heaven; Who give to it its gayest shadowings, And its most awful glories; ye who roll In the dark tempest, or at dewy evening Hang low in tenderest beauty; ye who, ever Changing your Protean aspects, now are gathered Like fleecy piles, when the mid-sun is brightest, Even in the height of heaven, and there repose, Solemnly calm, without a visible motion, Hour after hour, looking upon the earth With a serenest smile:—or ye who, rather, Heaped in those sulphury masses, heavily Jutting above their bases, like the smoke Poured from a furnace or a roused volcano, Stand on the dun horizon, threatening Lightning and storm,—who, lifted from the hills, March onward to the zenith, ever darkening, And heaving into more gigantic towers And mountainous piles of blackness,—who then roar With the collected winds within your womb, Or the far uttered thunders,—who ascend Swifter and swifter, till wide overhead Your vanguards curl and toss upon the tempest Like the stirred ocean on a reef of rocks Just topping o'er its waves, while deep below The pregnant mass of vapor and of flame Rolls with an awful pomp, and grimly lowers, Seeming to the struck eye of fear the car Of an offended spirit, whose swart features Glare through the sooty darkness, fired with vengeance, And ready with uplifted hand to smite And scourge a guilty nation; ye who lie, After the storm is over, far away, Crowning the dripping forests with the arch Of beauty, such as lives alone in heaven, Bright daughter of the sun, bending around From mountain unto mountain like the wreath Of victory, or like a banner telling Of joy and gladness; ye who round the moon Assemble, when she sits in the mid-sky In perfect brightness, and encircle her With a fair wreath of all aerial dyes; Ye who, thus hovering round her, shine like mountains Whose tops are never darkened, but remain, Centuries and countless ages, reared for temples Of purity and light; or ye who crowd To hail the new-born day, and hang for him, Above his ocean couch, a canopy Of all inimitable hues and colors, Such as are only pencilled by the hands Of the unseen ministers of earth and air, Seen only in the tinting of the clouds, And the soft shadowing of plumes and flowers; Or ye who, following in his funeral train, Light up your torches at his sepulchre, And open on us through the clefted hills Far glances into glittering worlds beyond The twilight of the grave, where all is light, Golden and glorious light, too full and high For mortal eye to gaze on, stretching out Brighter and ever brighter, till it spread, Like one wide, radiant ocean without bounds, One infinite sea of glory:—Thus, ye clouds, And in innumerable other shapes Of greatness or of beauty, ye attend us, To give to the wide arch above us Life And all its changes. Thus it is to us A volume full of wisdom, but without ye One awful uniformity had ever With too severe a majesty oppressed us. THE GRAVES OF THE PATRIOTS. Here rest the great and good. Here they repose After their generous toil. A sacred band, They take their sleep together, while the year Comes with its early flowers to deck their graves, And gathers them again, as Winter frowns. Theirs is no vulgar sepulchre,—green sods Are all their monument, and yet it tells A nobler history than pillared piles, Or the eternal pyramids. They need No statue nor inscription to reveal Their greatness. It is round them; and the joy With which their children tread the hallowed ground That holds their venerated bones, the peace That smiles on all they fought for, and the wealth That clothes the land they rescued,—these, though mute, As feeling ever is when deepest,—these Are monuments more lasting than the fanes Reared to the kings and demigods of old. Touch not the ancient elms, that bend their shade Over their lowly graves; beneath their boughs There is a solemn darkness, even at noon, Suited to such as visit at the shrine Of serious liberty. No factious voice Called them unto the field of generous fame, But the pure consecrated love of home. No deeper feeling sways us, when it wakes In all its greatness. It has told itself To the astonished gaze of awestruck kings, At Marathon, at Bannockburn, and here, Where first our patriots sent the invader back Broken and cowed. Let these green elms be all To tell us where they fought and where they lie. Their feelings were all nature, and they need No art to make them known. They live in us, While we are like them, simple, hardy, bold, Worshipping nothing but our own pure hearts, And the one universal Lord. They need No column pointing to the heaven they sought, To tell us of their home. The heart itself, Left to its own free purpose, hastens there, And there alone reposes. Let these elms Bend their protecting shadow o'er their graves, And build with their green roof the only fane, Where we may gather on the hallowed day That rose to them in blood, and set in glory. Here let us meet, and while our motionless lips Give not a sound, and all around is mute In the deep sabbath of a heart too full For words or tears, here let us strew the sod With the first flowers of spring, and make to them An offering of the plenty Nature gives, And they have rendered ours—perpetually. THE DESOLATE CITY. I had a vision.— A city lay before me, desolate, And yet not all decayed. A summer sun Shone on it from a most ethereal sky, And the soft winds threw o'er it such a balm, One would have thought it was a sepulchre, And this the incense offered to the manes Of the departed. In the light it lay Peacefully, as if all its thousands took Their afternoon's repose, and soon would wake To the loud joy of evening. There it lay, A city of magnificent palaces, And churches towering more like things of Heaven, The glorious fabrics fancy builds in clouds, And shapes on loftiest mountains;—bright their domes Threw back the living ray, and proudly stood Many a statue, looking like the forms Of spirits hovering in mid-air. Tall trees, Cypress and plane, waved over many a hill Cumbered with ancient ruins,—broken arches, And tottering columns,—vaults, where never came The blessed beam of day, but only lamps Shedding a funeral light, were kindled there, And gave to the bright frescoes on the walls, And the pale statues in their far recesses, A dim religious awe. Rudely they lay, Scarce marking out to the inquisitive eye Their earliest outline. But as desolate Slumbered the newer city, though its walls Were yet unbroken, and its towering domes Had never stooped to ruin. All was still; Hardly the faintest sound of living thing Moved through the mighty solitude;—and yet All wore the face of beauty. Not a cloud Hung in the lofty sky, that seemed to rise In twofold majesty, so bright and pure, It seemed indeed a crystalline sphere;—and there The sun rode onward in his conquering march Serenely glorious. From the mountain heights, Tinged with the blue of heaven, to the wide sea, Glassed with as pure a blue, one desolate plain Spread out, and over it the fairest sky Bent round and blessed it. Life was teeming there In all its lower forms, a wilderness Of rank luxuriance; flowers, and purpling vines Matted with deepest foliage, hid the ruins, And gave the semblance of a tangled wood To piles, that once were loudly eloquent With the glad cry of thousands. There were gardens Round stateliest villas, full of graceful statues And temples reared to woodland deities; And they were overcrowded with the excess Of beauty. All that most is coveted Beneath a colder sky grew wantonly And richly there. Myrtles and citrons filled The air with fragrance. From the tufted elm, Bent with its own too massy foliage, hung Clusters of sunny grapes in frosted purple, Drinking in spirit from the glowing air, And dropping generous dews. The very wind Seemed there a lover, and his easy wings Fanned the gay bowers, as if in fond delay He bent o'er loveliest things, too beautiful Ever to know decay. The silent air, Floating as softly as a cloud of roses Dropped from Idalia in a dewy shower,— The air itself seemed like the breath of heaven Filling the groves of Eden. Yet these walls Are desolate,—not a trace of living man Is found amid these glorious works of man, And nature's fairer glories. Why should he Be absent from the festival of life, The holiday of nature? Why not come To add to the sweet sounds of winds and waters,— Of winds uttering Æolian melodies To the bright, listening flowers, and waters falling Most musical from marble fountains wreathed With clustering ivy, like a poet's brow,— Why comes he not to add his higher strains, And be the interpreter of lower things, In intellectual worship, at the throne Of the beneficent Power that gave to them Their pride and beauty?—“In these palaces, These awful temples, these religious caves, These hoary ruins, and these twilight groves Teeming with life and love, a secret plague Dwells, and the unwary foot that ventures here Returns not.—Fly! To linger here is death.” MORNING AMONG THE HILLS. A night had passed away among the hills, And now the first faint tokens of the dawn Showed in the east. The bright and dewy star, Whose mission is to usher in the morn, Looked through the cool air, like a blessed thing In a far purer world. Below there lay, Wrapped round a woody mountain tranquilly, A misty cloud. Its edges caught the light, That now came up from out the unseen depth Of the full fount of day, and they were laced With colors ever brightening. I had waked From a long sleep of many-changing dreams, And now in the fresh forest air I stood Nerved to another day of wandering. Before me rose a pinnacle of rock, Lifted above the wood that hemmed it in, And now already glowing. There the beams Came from the far horizon, and they wrapped it In light and glory. Round its vapory cone A crown of far-diverging rays shot out, And gave to it the semblance of an altar Lit for the worship of the undying flame, That centred in the circle of the sun, Now coming from the ocean's fathomless caves, Anon would stand in solitary pomp Above the loftiest peaks, and cover them With splendor as a garment. Thitherward I bent my eager steps; and through the grove, Now dark as deepest night, and thickets hung With a rich harvest of unnumbered gems, Waiting the clearer dawn to catch the hues Shed from the starry fringes of its veil On cloud and mist and dew, and backward thrown In infinite reflections, on I went, Mounting with hasty foot, and thence emerging, I scaled that rocky steep, and there awaited Silent the full appearing of the sun. Below there lay a far-extended sea, Rolling in feathery waves. The wind blew o'er it And tossed it round the high ascending rocks, And swept it through the half-hidden forest tops, Till, like an ocean waking into storm, It heaved and weltered. Gloriously the light Crested its billows, and those craggy islands Shone on it like to palaces of spar Built on a sea of pearl. Far overhead, The sky, without a vapor or a stain, Intensely blue, even deepened into purple, Where, nearer the horizon, it received A tincture from the mist, that there dissolved Into the viewless air,—the sky bent round, The awful dome of a most mighty temple, Built by omnipotent hands for nothing less Than infinite worship. There I stood in silence;— I had no words to tell the mingled thoughts Of wonder and of joy that then came o'er me, Even with a whirlwind's rush. So beautiful, So bright, so glorious! Such a majesty In yon pure vault! So many dazzling tints In yonder waste of waves,—so like the ocean With its unnumbered islands there encircled By foaming surges, that the mounting eagle, Lifting his fearless pinion through the clouds To bathe in purest sunbeams, seemed an ospray Hovering above his prey, and yon tall pines, Their tops half mantled in a snowy veil, A frigate with full canvas, bearing on To conquest and to glory. But even these Had round them something of the lofty air In which they moved; not like to things of earth, But heightened, and made glorious, as became Such pomp and splendor. Who can tell the brightness, That every moment caught a newer glow, That circle, with its centre like the heart Of elemental fire, and spreading out In floods of liquid gold on the blue sky And on the opaline waves, crowned with a rainbow Bright as the arch that bent above the throne Seen in a vision by the holy man In Patmos! who can tell how it ascended, And flowed more widely o'er that lifted ocean, Till instantly the unobstructed sun Rolled up his sphere of fire, floating away,— Away in a pure ether, far from earth, And all its clouds,—and pouring forth unbounded His arrowy brightness! From that burning centre At once there ran along the level line Of that imagined sea, a stream of gold,— Liquid and flowing gold, that seemed to tremble Even with a furnace heat,—on to the point Whereon I stood. At once that sea of vapor Parted away, and, melting into air, Rose round me, and I stood involved in light, As if a flame had kindled up, and wrapped me In its innocuous blaze. Away it rolled, Wave after wave. They climbed the highest rocks, Poured over them in surges, and then rushed Down glens and valleys, like a wintry torrent Dashed instant to the plain. It seemed a moment, And they were gone, as if the touch of fire At once dissolved them. Then I found myself Midway in air; ridge after ridge below Descended, with their opulence of woods, Even to the dim-seen level, where a lake Flashed in the sun, and from it wound a line, Now silvery bright, even to the farthest verge Of the encircling hills. A waste of rocks Was round me,—but below how beautiful, How rich the plain! a wilderness of groves And ripening harvests; while the sky of June, The soft blue sky of June, and the cool air, That makes it then a luxury to live, Only to breathe it, and the busy echo Of cascades, and the voice of mountain brooks, Stole with such gentle meanings to my heart, That where I stood seemed heaven. THE PERPETUAL YOUTH OF NATURE. A SOLILOQUY. With what a hollow voice these broken ruins Tell of the vanished past. Here they are thrown Too rudely for the most inquiring eye To read one legend of the men who reared them, Or even form a guess of those who made These walls their home. It is a beautiful clime, And all the year is lovely on these shores; For there is neither winter here to blight, Nor the hot sun to dry the fountains up, And make the plains a desert. Nature here Has built her bower of evergreens: and flowers Are never wanting for her festivals, And these are every day, and there is in them Such a perpetual variety Of bright and fair, the heart is never weary Of the soft revelry;—and yet no trace Of human footsteps on the bordering sands Of the calm ocean gives a sign that man Has found his way before me to this haunt Of silence and repose. Well, be it so, And I will hold myself the rightful lord Of all this fair domain, by the strong claim Of first discovery. No inheritance Of gilded palaces, or loaded fields Bent with a thousand harvests, could so fill My spirit with the stirring health of joy, As thus to hold myself the sole possessor Of such a solitude,—so full of life, And yet so mute,—so bright and beautiful, And yet so darkly shadowed with the pall Of buried ages. How the merry vines Go gadding in the brisk and spirited air, That even calls from out the barren rocks A welcoming smile. The wind is very low,— It hardly wags the shrinking violet, Or sends a quiver to the aspen-leaf, Or curls the green wave on the pebbled shore, Or gives a wrinkle to the quiet sea, That, like a giant resting from his toil, Sleeps in the morning sun. That flowery palm Has a most glorious aspect as he bows In silent worship to his rising god; And from his station on the tallest pile Of these mysterious ruins, once the shrine, It may be, of the living Sun himself, How like a most majestic sovereign He keeps his lofty seat, and yet adores The Lord that made him! It is wonderful That man should hold himself so haughtily, And talk of an immortal name, and feed His proud ambition with such daring hopes As creatures of a more eternal nature Alone should form. Why, 't is a mockery Too poor for tears, and yet too sad for smiles, To think how much of glitter and of pride Has flaunted in the sun, and sent him back His fullest beams. These rude, disjointed heaps, That seem the chaos of a broken world, And hardly give us signs enough to show They were not thrown from out the central earth By an upheaving earthquake,—these were bright With such barbaric pomp, as made the sun Muffle his head, and hide himself at noon To shun the poor encounter. So they sung, The sycophants, who told the gorgeous tyrant Of these once peopled shores, he was a god, And with the port and bearing of a god Sat on his throne, or in his chariot Went sounding on his long triumphal way. Fools! and where are they? Not a mark to tell The shadows of their names. The tooth of Time Has ground the marble sculptures to rude forms, Such as the falling waters eat from rocks In the deep gloom of caves!—and yet, as if They meant to show their scorn of him who calls Himself their lord, the beasts and creeping things Have come from out their deserts and their holes, And made their dens in the crushed palaces, And round the buried altars hollowed out Their lurking-places. O, how fresh and fair Grows the young grass, and how the wild vines clasp The rifted columns, with as bright a foliage As when from out the bosom of the earth First rose the rampant Spring, and the glad Sun Laughed from his azure throne to see the buds Put out their tender leaves, and the soft green Spread like a carpet to the tented sky. ITALY. A CONFERENCE. A. Why hast thou such a downward look of care, As if thine eye refused the sweet communion Of these enchanted skies? I cannot weary In gazing on them, there is such a clearness In the mid-noon; and then the calmer hours Have such a glory round them, that I grow Enamored of their clouds. O, they have caught Their hues in heaven, and they come stealing to us Like messengers of love, to kindle up This volatile air. How light and thin it floats! Methinks I now can pass into the depths Of yon wide firmament, it lies so open And shows so fair. The stars are hung below it, And they are moving in a vacancy, Like the poised eagle. How the studded moon, All dropped with glittering points, rolls on its way Between the pillowy clouds, and that which seems A crystalline arch,—a dome that rests on air, Buoyed by its lightness! Can thy heavy eyes Still pore on the discolored earth, and choose Their home in darkness? Something weighs upon thee With no light burden, if thou hast no heart To mingle with the beautiful world around thee. B. Thou talk'st of clouds and skies. Has the sweet face Of Spring a power to charm away the fiends That riot on the soul? Will the foul spirit Go, when the cock crows, like a muttering ghost, To find his kindred shades, and leave the heart To gladden through the day? and dares he not To fill it with his terrors when the sun Is out in heaven? Is there a sovereign balm In cloudless skies, and bright and glowing noons, To make the spirit light, and drive from it The moody madness and the listless sorrow? I feel there is not. Something tells me, here, There may be such a grief, that nothing earthly Hath power to stay it. I too have a feeling, How beautiful this clime! and though the native Looks on it with a blank indifference, To us who had our birth in clouded skies, And reckoned it a bright and fortunate day If the sun gave us but an hour at noon, It is indeed a luxury to see Whole days without a cloud, but these light shapes, That float around us more like heavenly spirits, They are so bright and wear such glorious hues, Or hang so quietly, and look so pure, When all is still at noon. O, I have felt This luxury of sense, but yet it comes not So far as here. The heart knows nothing of it; And now that I have seen so many days, All of an equal brightness, like the calm That reigns, they say, perpetually in heaven, Why, I grow weary of them, and my thoughts Are on the past. Thou need'st no other answer. A. 'T is not the barren luxury of sense That makes me love these skies; but there is in them A living spirit. I can feel it stealing Even to my heart of hearts, and waking there Feelings that never yet have stirred within me, So blessed, that I almost weep to think How poor my life without them. I now walk In a glad company of happy visions, And all the air seems like a dwelling-place For glorious creatures. Like the shifting waves, That toss on the white shore when evening breezes Steal to the land in summer, they are floating In airy trains around me. Now they come Laughing on yonder mountain-side, a troop Of jovial nymphs; and now they flit away Round the far islands of the golden sea, Islands of light that seem to hang in air, Midway in heaven. No wonder they so love The song and dance, and walk with such a look Of thoughtless gayety,—the merry beggars, Who breed like insects on these sunny shores, And live as idly. There are glorious faces Among them,—there are Roman spirits here, And Grecian eyes that tell a thousand fancies, Like those that shaped their deities, and wrought Perfection. True, they have no stirring hopes To lift them; yet at times they will give vent To the o'erburdened soul, and then they speak In oracles, or, like the harp of Memnon, They utter poetry, as the bright skies And wandering winds awake it. Who can wonder, That every voice is bursting out in music, And every peasant tunes his mandolin To the delicious airs, that creep so softly Into the slumbering ear! O, 't is a land Where life is doubled, and a brighter world Rolls over this, and there the spirit lives In a gay paradise, and here we breathe An atmosphere of roses! B. Yes,—but this Is nothing to the heart. They never felt, These summer flies, who buzz so gayly round us, They never felt, one moment, what we feel With such a silent tenderness, and keep So closely round our hearts. We do not wake The echoes with our loud and thoughtless carols, Nor sit whole days beneath a bowering vine, Singing its amber juice, and telling too Of starry eyes, and soft and languishing looks, And talking of our agonies with smiles, Making a sport of sorrow. No, our year, With its long time of gloom, and hurried days Of warmth, that call for more of toil than pleasure,— Our pensive year forbids the wandering spirit To make itself a song-bird. We must keep Our sorrows and our hopes close cherished by us, Till the heart softens, and by often musing Takes a deep, serious tone, and has a feeling For all that suffer. So we often bear A grief that is the burden of a life, And will not leave us. Something that would seem Too trifling to be laughed at here will weigh And weigh upon us, till we cannot lift it, And then we pine and die. Her heart is broken, And the worm feeds upon her early roses, And now her lily fades, and all its brightness Turns to a green and sallow melancholy, And then we strew her grave; but here the passion Breaks out in wildness, then is sung away With a complaining air, and so is ended. I have no sympathy with such light spirits, But I can see my sober countrymen Gather around their winter's hearth, and read Of no unreal suffering, and then weep Big tears that ease the heart, and need no words To make their meaning known. One silent hour Of deep and thoughtful feeling stands me more Than a whole age of such a heartless mirth, As a bright summer wakens. THE FAIR ITALIAN. She looked how lovely. Not the face of heaven In its serenest calm, nor earth in all Its garniture of flowers, nor all that live In the bright world of dreams, nor all the eye Of a creative spirit meets in air, Could, in the smile and sunshine of her charms, Not feel itself o'ermastered by such rare And perfect beauty. Grace was over all; Her form, her face, her attitudes, her motions, Each had peculiar charms. Like gliding swans, Sailing upon a smoothly mirrored lake Before the breeze of evening, when the waves Curl rippling round their bosoms, so she moved Through all the mazy dance. She bore herself So gently, that the lily on its stalk Bends not so easily its dewy head, As with a gliding step she wound her way To the soft echoes of the light guitar, The dreamy music of her sunny clime, Where all is languishing. There was a brightness, How high, and yet how soothing, in her smile! O, I could look on her a summer's day, Delighted,—every moment more delighted, With the soft sense that hovers over me When on a slope of moss I lay me down In the warm sun of April. I could kneel In worship to her, as a radiant vision Sent from a purer world, without a stain Of earth breathed over her, but all entire In infant loveliness, yet ripe and full In her meridian elegance, a flower With all its leaves expanded, and its hues Mellowed by kindly sunbeams. It was evening; The sun looked through the wood of chestnut-trees, And bronzed their rugged trunks, and lit their leaves, Till, as they rustled on the bending boughs, Each seemed a flake of gold; and far beyond them My eye caught glimpses of a quiet bay, A nook of sleeping waters, where the light Shone with a flashing blaze. It was so still! The wind had stolen into the mountain valleys, And left the plains and hillocks to the calm That sinks upon the world when night steals on, And the day takes its farewell, like the words Of a departing friend, or the last tone Of hallowed music in a minster's aisles, Heard, when it floats along the shade of elms, In the still place of graves. A wood of palms Rose on a far hill, where the amber light Was rich and dazzling, with their pointed leaves So nicely balanced, that the faintest breathing Of the wide air swayed them in graceful curves, While all below seemed in the still repose Of sleep, the twin of death, that infant slumber Where life is only visible in the play Of blushes, which for ever come and go On the soft cheek's transparency, as pure As the clear rime that masks the untimely rose, Mellowing its purple to the hues of heaven, The tremulous tints of air. I lay abroad In careless dreaming, by the twisted roots Of an outspreading beech-tree, and methought The swains of Enna and Parthenope Were dancing round me to the sound of viols And oaten pipes. As the light sank away, The rose and jasmine thickets, and the shades O'erhung with vines, in the full scent of flowers, Seemed populous with the sylvan family Of nymphs and fauns. I listened to the sounds Of Grecian melody and song, and lay Reclining on a couch of new-plucked leaves, Attentive to the many quiet voices, That fill a summer's night,—the drowsy hum Of beetles, and the shrill cicada's song, And the complaining of the nightingale, That in a bush of brambles passed away The silent hours in answering to the echoes Herself had made. As thus I sank away In pleasant thoughts of the dear times of old, I saw a group of dancers, on a lawn Not distant, to the music of a lute Cross the yet rosy twilight. She was there, Lovelier for the witching time they chose To be their hour of joy. Her full, dark curls Were clustered on a brow of ivory, And fell in lavish wealth, shading a neck Clear as an alabaster shrine concealing A ruby, that with soft suffusion fills it, As with a living glow. Her face was kindled By the quick glances of her large black eyes, That flashed from underneath her arching brows, Like gems in caves; and yet there was a softness At times, when shades of thought stole over her; But in the happy consciousness of beauty Her heart was all so joyous, that her smiles Gave a perpetual sunlight to that face, So beautiful, to see it was to love. I could not choose but watch with earnest gaze One of so perfect form, and finished grace, That those who moved around her were but foils Heightening the one sole diamond. When I look On one so fair, I must believe that Heaven Sent her in kindness, that our hearts might waken To its own loveliness, and lift themselves, By such an adoration, from a dark And grovelling world. Such beauty should be worshipped, And not a thought of weakness or decay Should mingle with the pure and hallowed dreams In which it dwells before us. It should live Eternal; or, if it must pass away, And lose one tint of its now perfect brightness, Let it be hidden from me, for the sense That all this glow must fade falls on my heart Like the cold weight of death. INSCRIPTION. Stranger, if thou hast ever blessed the shade That lent thee shelter from the sun and rain, Thou wilt not rest thee underneath this elm Without a sense of gratitude. The boughs That overshadow thee have borne the brunt Of centuries, and have records of the past In all their whispering leaves. We cannot hear them Telling their tales, through the long summer day, To the cool west-wind, and have other thoughts Than of the generations who have sat, In long succession, on the mossy turf That beds these twisted roots. Sunshine and calm, Darkness and storm, have been around these boughs, And they have smiled to the unclouded sky, And rocked in the rude tempest, but have stood Unbroken, while the stream of human life Has ebbed and flowed like the perpetual tide, And hardly left a trace upon its shores To tell us where it came. Then rest thee, stranger, And think thou hearest in the ancient wood A monitor, that warns thee of thy end With a low, earnest voice, a voice of kindness, That, like a silent fountain running over, Refreshes where it flows, and, like its waters, Gives life to the sere heart it passes by. A VISION. I have been haunted by an awful dream,— A vision of my childhood,—one that grew From an o'erheated fancy, nursed to fear In a dark, visionary creed. A star, Of a malign aspect, had been to me, For a few weeks of dread uncertainty, The prophet of evil; and I saw in it The minister of judgments, such as oft Had been denounced before me, and had grown To an undoubting faith. Methought that star, As in a vision of the night I lay, Stood with its train directed to the earth; And every moment it did spread itself, And grew a deeper crimson. Where I was, I could not tell; but I stood gazing on it With unaverted eye, and I could watch it Taking ten thousand fiery shapes, and changing To every terrible hue and form, and still Widening and widening out its burning orb, Till a whole quarter of the heavens was red And glowing like a furnace. Then, methought, A form stood visible within it, vast And indistinct, as a far mountain seen Through a dense vapor, when the morning strikes it, And makes it such a thing as the mind frames, When it goes wandering through the infinite, And builds on dreams. I gazed upon it, charmed And fascinated by its terrible glory, And with it such a sense of fear, the drops Stood thick upon my forehead, and my heart Was near to bursting. 'T was an agony Of wonder and of death; for I beheld Already come the day of doom, and earth Seemed parched and burnt by the intensity Of that approaching flame. The sky above Was like a vaulted furnace, and it quivered And sparkled in the heat, and at the centre, Transparent in the fierceness of its fire, Still that illimitable form did frown Blacker than tenfold night. His quick approach Left me no time to scan him, but he seemed To gather in himself all I had heard Or dreamed of horrible. A muttering sound, Like that of far-off winds, or smothered flame Roaring in caves,—a sound that fell like fate On my stunned ear,—came as a warning voice, That earth was now within the wasting sphere Of that consuming plague. At once the wind Seemed to blow over me, with hot, thick breath, Wafting such clouds of smoke and sheets of fire, That all around me seemed one conflagration; And even the firm foundations of the hills Cracked and fell inward, and one long, long peal Gave warning, that this ponderous globe was rent And shivered. Suddenly a burst of flame, So clear and strong no thought can image it, Filled the whole visible space; and still it flashed, And flashed, till in an instant utter darkness Closed heavily around me, and I woke: I woke, and yet the horrors of that dream Would visit me at times, even when I grew To know its causes, and could reason of it; And though the mind moved in its own pure light, And stood aloof from fear, yet there were moments, When the dark memory of this dream would quell me Well-nigh to trembling. DREAMS. “Aut quæ sopitos deludunt Somnia sensus.” I. Methought 'twas night; and my unquiet spirit Stood in the silent presence of a Power Invisible, though felt. There was no voice, And yet unutterable thoughts came o'er me, Accompanied by feelings such as grow From some unearthly music. There were words Spoken as in the fever of a dream, Breathless and indistinct, yet full of awe High and mysterious. The air was full Of sights, that scarce were seen, dim images, Crowding from out the depth of darkness, wild And terrible, though calm. They looked upon me Intensely, and they seemed to beckon me Thoughtful and sad. No utterance meanwhile Told me their wishes, but they made themselves Visible to me in their gathering brows And lowering glances. Then they waved me on To follow them, and, like a vanishing troop Of shadows, mingled in the thicker shades, And all were lost. A deeper darkness hung Around me, like a burden, and it seemed To close me in a prison, like the grave, Narrow and cold. A damp and deathly chill Ran through me, and methought the earth beneath Sunk, and the utter night that circled me Grew thicker, till all thoughts were objectless, And memory vanished. All the little light That centred in my brain seemed like a taper Amid the vapors of a charnel-house, Quivering and pale; a blue, unearthly flame Hovers awhile above it, and it falls Beneath the dank oppression, and then dies. So thought, and life, and all their energies Trembled awhile, and hung upon their close, And then went out. I lay entranced, I know not If hours or ages,—not a sleep of dreams, Busy and full of forms and fantasies, But blank and desolate, without a motion, Even in the spirit's core,—an utter death, That leaves no memory of itself, and makes Myriads of years a moment. So I lay, Forgotten and alone. Methought a stir Came to my heart and brain, and some dim feelings Were moving there, faint as the light of shadows, When night is deepest, and the waning moon Hurries behind a cloud. They grew upon me, And there was light and joy,—a happy dream, Confused and shapeless, but a dream of days That are to us our heaven; the early days Of wonder and of hope, the blissful days Of buoyancy and love, unspeakable And holy love, stainless and bright and pure,— The heart's devotion. They were in my dreams Struggling to life, and taking, every moment, A fairer being. I was on the hills, Methought; and it was spring; and one sweet bird Settled beside me, on a flowering thorn, And sang how softly! Then the morning came, And there was brightness, and the kindling clouds Were pearl and gold and flame; and then the sun Rolled up, and all was day. An avenue Of ancient elms bent over me their boughs, And the slant light came underneath the arch, And tinted all the leaves, the quivering leaves, With rainbows, till a vault of liquid fire Seemed lifted round me, and I walked unhurt Amid the glorious furnace. There was magic And wonder in the hour; and then I looked On the calm ocean, like a burnished sheet Of emerald, and all its long, long waves Were ridged with flame; and by me flowed a brook, Prattling its merry tale to the cool winds, That shook the grass and flowers, that stood around it To gaze upon its mirror, and behold, Narcissus-like, their beauty; and it wound Its way unto a meadow, all one bed Of glancing diamonds. 'T was a dream of light, And soon as full of love. Methought a voice, A well-known voice, a voice of very sweetness, So tender that I felt the first fresh tears Flow at its touch of music, and dissolve me In the young happiness, once known, and then For ever gone,—methought that tender voice Came from a wood hard by; and it was singing Catches of old familiar tunes, the treasures Of infant memory, that warble on In the bright stream of innocent joys, through all Our darker years, and hold their unchecked way Even to the old man's grave. I heard that voice,— And then awoke within me such a flow Of passionate thoughts, blended of bright and dark, Gentle and wild,—a flood that long had swelled And borne me on its crest, till it became A sea of cloud and storm,—that, in the grasp And agony of passion, and the last, Fixed struggle of despair, again the light Faded around me, and I sank once more In night and horror. II. Darkness was thick around me, as of old, In Egypt, it was felt. No glimmering lamp, Nor solitary starlight, found its way Through the dim shadows that encompassed me, But all was waste and void,—a desolation Without a form or voice,—a deathlike silence, Where even the waters had forgot to flow, And winds to whisper,—such a total silence, My breathing startled me, although I held it In fear and awe. The heavens had vanished then, And earth was gone, only the foothold where I stood and dared not move,—in like suspense As when, upon a mountain crag, a mist Sweeps suddenly around the hunter's path, And hides the precipice and dread descent, Where all is death,—he pauses, and awaits The passing of the vapor, till it rolls Its heavy wreaths around the glacier heights, And all at once reveals the dark abyss Below him, where he hung close on the verge, And knew not of his danger; such a fear And wild suspense held me, and then I stood Waiting for morning, while the laggard hours Seemed lengthened out to ages. Who has felt The sickening doubt, the cold uncertainty, The dying of all hope, when we have seen Day after day pass on, and yet no sight, No tidings of the expected happiness, On which our being rested, we had fixed it So deeply in our hearts,—he only knows How much I suffered in those long, dull hours, That heavily dragged on, and brought no dawn, No token of it; still the same blank void Closed me, and narrowed to a sepulchre's Scant compass all the universe to me, And left me nothing but to count my pulses, And tell my hours by throbs. The air seemed thick And deathly, aud a sense of suffocation Pressed on me, like a mountain's weight, and bore me Seemingly down a gulf, from which I struggled To lift me; but the ever-backward plunge Hurried me, like the rushing of a torrent, Farther and farther from all hope of light Or the sweet face of heaven. O, had a star, A single lonely star, one of the smallest, That scarcely twinkles when the winter's night Is clearest, and there is no moon to shade The lesser lights, and the bright evening planet Has set, and Jove not mounted yet his throne, And made his vassals dim,—had such a star Broke out a moment, from the thick obscure, To tell me where to look upon the sky, And, in that utter void, forget not where To wait the dawning, I had then had hope, And not been wholly desolate; and yet None greeted me, but all was like a chaos, After its waves have settled to a calm, And even the swell, that follows on the storm, Subsided into stillness. Then, methought, I heard a sound, like the far roar of winds Amid the forest oaks, when the whole sea Of branches tosses, as the coming tempest Stoops from its car of clouds, and scourges them, Till the wide wilderness bows to the dust Before its anger. Such a hollow sound Rolled onward, and, yet louder every moment, Seemed like the rush of myriad wings, or sweep Of mailed horsemen, when the beaten plain Trembles, and, in the mid-encounter, wide Their armor shocks and rings. A breathless fear, A terror that had winged my flying feet, Had not the deeper dread of what I knew not Beyond the point I stood on held me fixed And rooted to the ground, and with it, too, A mingled feeling of desire and hope, Wakened me from my trance, and turned me whence The rushing came. Methought the darkness seemed To fade, and from its womb a glimmering rose, Pale and uncertain, as the flitting glance Of moonlight through a storm. Anon it took More fixedness, and then it reared itself Into a dreamy shape, a wavering form, Hovering in mist far on the sleeping waves, When night is deep, and all the light in heaven Just gives a visible outline, so that earth Seems like a land of shadows. Then it stood Before me, and a chill and spectral glare Invested it, and as it onward drew, With ominous bearing, I could dimly catch Traces of human likeness, yet it seemed More like a moon-struck ghost than living thing; For there was not a motion in its limbs, Gesture, or step, but it seemed borne along On the swift tide of air,—its glaring eyeballs Rolled not, and had no meaning, but they stared, Like a blind statue's, with everted lids, Glassy and cold,—and from its bloodless lips There seemed to come no voice, for they were still, And yet stood open, like the last fixed gasp Of dissolution. Soon the vision neared me, And then I heard a low and muttering sound, Like the faint utterance of forbidden charms, When, even herself in fear, the sorceress Evokes the shades of hell, or calls the spirits Whose dwelling is in air. Then, as I heard it, I started and looked round me; for no breath Quivered upon those ashy lips, and yet I knew the voice came from them, and it sounded Hollow, as from the tomb: “Creature of earth, Child of despair and fear, of doubt and madness, I bid thee follow me; the spell is on thee, And where I go, thou must perforce attend me; And I will show thee such unearthly things As will not leave thee to thy dying day, But haunt thee like the secret consciousness Of undiscovered crime.” He said; and then Turned from me, and went moving through the darkness, Lofty and proud. At once I felt myself Lifted, as by the sweeping of a tempest, And borne along so rapidly, my breath And sense were lost. Awhile I knew of nothing, But that my flight was onward; then my brain Grew wonted to the change, and fined itself, So that all objects took a startling clearness, Though seen in deepest shade. A magic world Seemed bursting into being, wondrous, wild, Majestic, beautiful, obscure, and dark, Then bright to dazzling. Countless images Crowded before me, till the eye was weary In looking onward through the living sea, That rolled upon me, like the toppling waves Heaved from the womb of ocean, surge on surge, To burst upon the shore. I hurried by them, And back they rushed behind me, like the hills And groves and towns and spires, when borne along The bosom of some mighty stream by winds That send the vessel through the frothy waves, Like a shaft winged with fate. It were a tale Too high for mortal utterance, to tell The shapes that met me, and they ravished me With such unearthly joy, the vision melted In its own fervor, and I found myself Alone in darkness. III. I had a dream of music and of song. Methought one thrill of general harmony Pervaded all the region, and the winds Were all attuned, each to its several part, As if some master spirit had controlled Their sounds to one accord. Fast-flowing waves Seemed rolling from an ocean, whose deep heart Fed them and never failed; and they came onward, Each with its crown of foam; and as they struck The shaken shore, their burst was like the echo Of organ notes in heaven,—majestic sounds, Awful and terrible, yet far and sweet As the last pause of thunder, when it sinks In the embrace of silence. So my ear Seemed full to overflowing with these strains Of modulated sound,—loud, airy swells, And solemn pauses,—touches, as if made By a most gentle hand; then lingering peals, That died away in echoes; and again Soft-stealing symphonies, that wound their way Into my heart, like Zephyr, when he haunts The first-blown field of spring, in fond delay Pausing at every flower, and loading thence His wings with balm. As yet there was no vision, But deep and utter night,—the night of Hades, Through which the bodiless spirits make their way, Unheard, unseen, and one impervious veil Of darkness covers all. The music paused, And all was one deep hush,—so deep and still, The beating of my heart was audible, And my own breathing mingled in my dreams Like the far rush of waters. Then there came A solemn march of melody, a flow Of faint, unearthly warblings, like the sighs Of sorrowing ghosts; and these stole through my brain Like lapsing fountains; and anon there rushed One tide of sound, that poured its airy surges Into my inmost soul. And as the curtain Rolls up its shadowy folds, and slowly opens The glories of the scene, far back retiring In avenues of pomp, and fading off In the blue tint of mountains, where some rock Catches the coming dawn, all else below Cradled in slumbering shade, so, it meseemed, The vision opened on me. Faint and chill It rose before me; and its floating forms Drew their dim outlines on a cold, wan heaven, Where neither moon, nor star, nor even dawn Gave light and hope,—one rayless blank, embracing Within its leaden cope shapes indistinct, Confused, and void,—a chaos, like the dreams That haunt a sick man's couch,—a waste of shadows, Like mountains in a storm, swelling and heaving, Broader and higher still, their giant peaks, Till the eye shrinks from gazing. So it rose, That visonary pomp, and stood awhile In terrible obscure; but then it seemed As if the opening eyelids of the dawn Unveiled their kindly beams, and sent abroad The charm of early day. Soft lights and shadows Now parted from each other, till they took Distinct and certain shapes; and then a world Of beauty lay before me. O, how calm And still it lay!—an infant world, reposing In its fresh, dewy cradle, hung with flowers, And rocked by summer winds, such as in June Crisp the smoothed ocean, till it smiles and kisses The green, embracing shore. Methought I stood Somewhere above it, and it stretched beneath me In beautiful stillness, for no living sound Stole upward on the motionless atmosphere, That circled it as with a brooding wing, And hushed it all to peace. Far off it lay, Too far to give the fainter lineaments, But the broad outline, that was broad and clear,— Clear as, at noon, the ridges and the vales On the blue mountain sloping to the sun Its walls, a nation's bulwarks; liker still That mountain, when it comes in the dense air That with a crystalline brightness ushers in The invisible storm,—when it comes drawing near us, Till the eye looks into its closest dells, And sees the fountain flowing so at hand, That fancy hears it murmur. Thus it lay In the new dawn;—but soon a cone of flame Rose up behind a circling ridge that closed The bosom of a vale, and poured abroad Rich golden waves, wherewith the mountain peaks And lowest hollows kindled up, and shone In more than dazzling brightness,—burnished gold, And liquid, trembling silver, so the rocks And winding rivers shone; and far away Lay the wide sweep of ocean, like a sheet Of molten glass, and all its islands burnt Cerulean, like the many hues that play On the hot gush of steel. Such was the pomp That ushered in the day; but when the sun Had come abroad, and now in the wide heaven Held on his lordly way, these glorious hues Were faded, and a clear and steady light Settled on all below. Methought I sank Slowly to earth, as through the summer air Floats the light plume, or from his heavenward seat An angel stoops to be the messenger Of love and joy. So gently I descended Into a flowery plain. Then rose around me A spacious theatre of wood and mountain, Stage over stage, from the low shrub that blooms Beside the hunter's path, up to the rocks With forehead bald and bare. Not long I stood, Before a strain of music flowed from out The forest, as if harps and voices joined In one unearthly song. It had the power Of magic, for at once my eyes were closed On all the beauty, that with near embrace Threw round its circling arms. The waving woods, Fresh flowers, and gurgling brooks, and rustling winds Had vanished, and my spirit, at the sound Transported, saw another world, and heard That music all alone. There lay before me A broad, bright river, glancing to the morn In silent motion; waving to and fro, Not in the wind, for the tall palm-tops stood Still, as if pillared marble, and the canes Shook not their spiry blades. Not even a ripple Gurgled along the shore; but to and fro Slowly it waved, and from its sloping mirror Sent back the coming day. Masses of shade Lay on the sleeping water, and between Opened its depths, how clear!—far down, the heavens Were vaulted, and the bands of lazy clouds, All in their gorgeous trim, went moving by With scarce perceptible motion, and their trains Waved, like the heavy banner of a ship Down-rolling from the top-mast, when the calm Has only breath enough to bend its folds In slow meanderings, and its stars shine out A momentary glance, and then retire, And twinkle then again, even as at night The stars dance on a fountain. Smooth it spread, That river, and the lotus leaves and flowers Covered its quiet bays with broidery Of blue and scarlet, on a ground of purple And virgin green; and with the long, slow swell They turned their mirrors sunward, one short flash, And then fell back in shade. A tall pagoda Rose opposite, and stretched its frowning walls, And lifted high its pyramids, o'erfretted With a wild waste of dreams; and high above Glittered the golden trident, for the sun Had risen there, in all that burst of power Had risen, with which he rushes on the heaven In equatorial climes. This was the hour Of prayer, and many white-robed devotees Came to the river's brink, to sip its wave And bathe them in its waters. Then I saw One like a nymph in shape, yet darkly tinted, Sit on the shady shore. She wove a crown Of starry flowers, and twined it gracefully Over her locks of jet; then to the east She turned, and sung her hymn. “Forth from thy mountain throne Advance along thy starry-vaulted way, Thou burning Lord of day! Thou holdest on alone, And all the gods of darkness steal away. Before thy luminous ray Night and her shades are flown. “Forth from the Swerga's bowers Thou issuest in thy robe of flame; And over heaven's blue lotus-flowers Rush the wild steeds no other hand can tame. They champ, they snort, they blow; They heave their winnowing manes; And round thy wheels, in sparkling showers, Perpetual streams of lightning flow, And fill yon azure plains. “Thy beamy car descends, And, gliding o'er the forest-trees, To the still river bends, Up-curling with the newly wakened breeze. Over its bright expanse Thy bounding coursers dance, And sweep the rolling foam before thy path. They hurry, hurry by; I hear the chariot's thunder nigh, I see the radiant God; He lifts his golden rod,— How terrible the flashing of his eye! Surya, Lord of day, retain thy wrath,— Send forth thy light to bless, and not to scath.” Her song had ceased, Its magic ended; but another spell At once was on me. Then, methought, a garden Spread out its avenues, o'erarched with planes, And filled with citron-flowers. One ancient tree Towered over me, and threw its shadow broad And deep below. Beneath it flowed a fountain Hewn from a natural rock, and by it rose A tomb, plain wrought in marble, turban-crowned, And on it carved, “Gulgheshti Musellara.” This was the tomb of Hafiz,—these the walks Of roses, by the fountain Mosellay, Dearer to him than bowers of Paradise, The Eastern heaven of love. Far around me lay One harvest of ripe roses, sending out The vaporous dews in one invisible cloud Of odorous bliss. The silence and the calm, The coolness and the shade, the sweet, low sound Of the still-flowing fountain, and the breath Of a faint wind that panted through the thickets, Were beautiful. They sank upon my soul, Like dews on withering flowers. They quickened me, And freshened all my thoughts. And then a voice Came from the garden, silver-toned and clear, But melancholy sweet, and often choked By stifling sobs, as if the bulbul wooed And languished for his rose, or as the dove Gurgles around his mate, or sadly mourns His widowed nest, and makes the twilight wood Responsive to his sighs. Slowly it came On through the vaulted alleys, till a group Of maidens, veiled and fearful, from the bowers Stepped cautious forth. On to the poet's tomb They glided, and, low bowed, their offerings gave Of garlands silken-twined, and with them dressed Their favorite shrine; then, throwing back their veils, Revealed their sunny locks, and full black eyes, Soft as the dove's, and rich in starry light As the gazelle's. So to the fountain bending, They dipped their pictured vases, and then rose And sprinkled all their wreaths, and bade them hang Fresh till the coming dawn,—then round the tomb They linked their hands, and, slowly moving, sang Their pious hymn. “O, weave the poet's tomb with flowers, And bring it water from the spring; And ever with the dawning day, O, let us haunt these lonely bowers, And on our withering garlands fling The freshening dew of Mosellay. “He best deserves a maiden's heart, Who teaches best her heart to love. O, how can she so well repay The bard who taught the gentle art? O, can she give him aught above The freshening dew of Mosellay? “He loved this calm and cool retreat, And with his friend and mistress oft In music passed the summer day. In vain the noonbeam fiercely beat,— He only felt it murmuring soft, The gushing dew of Mosellay. “And then he crowned his bowl with wine, And pressed it to his maiden's lip,— She smiled, and moved the gift away. A maiden, who would seem divine, Had better fill her bowl, and sip The freshening dew of Mosellay. “O gentle bard of joy and love! A gentle heart can only feel Thy sweetness, and alone repay. O, may we, like the trembling dove, From care and tumult often steal Beneath the bowers of Mosellay.” Another change:—The desert, Wide as an ocean, indistinct and dim Beneath the moon, now full, but hanging low In the pale west. A well,—its clustered palms, Tall columns, throwing far upon the sands Their shadows, and the stars between their leaves Coming and going. All beneath in sleep,— A wandering tribe, stretched round the stifled glow Of a half-covered fire, and quietly Behind them in a circle, deep reposing, Their only friends, their camels and their steeds, Harnessed and ready. Not unguarded rest The wanderers, but a sentinel apart, With spear uplifted, watches through the night, With the keen tiger's instinct, and afar Catches the faintest sound, and quick espies The smallest creature, on the very verge Of the encircling waste. There on his watch, I hear him cheat his weary hours, with tales Slow chanted, and with songs of love and sorrow, The treasures of his tribe, from age to age Transmitted even with awe. A mournful air. Well suited to his utter loneliness, Is now his pastime; sung so faint and low, It rather seems but sighs,—some captive's song, In a far distant land. “My father's tent is far away, And they are weeping there; And often, often do they say, ‘Where is our Kaled, where?’ “My master tells me to forget My home, my own dear home:— ‘Why wouldst thou close thy heart, nor let Another fondness come?’ “And Leila, then, his dark-eyed girl, Sits blushing by her sire,— I know that sire is not a churl; Can love be pointed higher? “But Leila, fair and sweet and young, And gentle as a fawn,— Though fairer poet never sung, Though fresh as early dawn,— “O Leila, think not of my heart,— I left my heart at home; O, from my home it could not part,— My spirit could not roam. “A fairer and a sweeter one Has all my fondness there,— And, ‘Oh!’ she often sighs alone, ‘Where is my Kaled, where?’” Another change:— A valley, freshly green, and girdled round With white rocks, tufted o'er with feathery ferns And rambling vines, and at their foot a cave, The issue of a spring, clear bubbling out In a perennial flow. Religious hands Have arched it over, for a fount, a well, In such a thirsty land, is loved and cherished, As a choice gift of Heaven. A date-tree bends Its clustered fruit, and nard and cassia scent The ever dewy air. The bibulous turf Catches the rolling moisture, as it glances O'er the bright pebbles, down the winding dell, Till one intensest verdure tapestries The level lawn. Between the parting hills, Off-stretching into dimness, opens out A sweep of plain, spotted with clumps of palms, White cottages and dove-cotes, avenues Of sycamores, and woods of olives blue With their autumnal load, and vineyards hung On the slope mountains; in the midst, the walls, And towers, and temple-tops, and pinnacles Of a wide city, sitting like a queen Amid her beautiful fields, and shining bright In the low evening sun. Around it flows A wandering river, hidden now beneath Its willows, now outflashing like a gush From the tapped furnace, now its course revealing, By wilderness and garden, ever fed From out its quickening wave,—still further winding, Like a gilt serpent, through a naked plain, On to a lake, now bright, but dimly fading Into a boundless blue. Up in that cove, On whose encircling battlements the cedar Nods to the evening wind, and the set sun Gilds with a fringe of gold the tall, gray rocks, Now glittering, though beneath them all is dim And shadowy cool,—up in that cove, a tent Is planted for the night, and round it throng A shepherd's train,—his children and his dogs Busy at play, his ruminant sheep reposing Under the shelving walls, with here and there A lordly ram, gazing upon his likeness In the deep, mirrored pool, and seeming half Intent on war,—a patriarchal scene, Like that of old, when Abraham fed his flocks In Mamre. 'T is the hour of evening prayer. A reverent pause,—and then the loud, clear voice Comes up amid those rocks, to Him who rules Alone in heaven, and after it a hymn Low sung by gentle voices. From the tent Flows the soft melody, more touching sweet For the veiled mystery within whose shade So much of beauty breathes. With that low hymn Came darkness to my dream; and all the pomp Of mountain, forest, vale, and ocean faded Slowly and solemnly away, and vanished In utter gloom. As after many a train Of bright illusions, cities, camps, and caves, Dark robbers, helmed hosts, and monarchs seated Proud on their thrones,—after gay sights and sounds, The measured march, the merry dance, the rush And clash of battle,—when the eye is fixed Intensely on the full catastrophe, Glad for relief, yet lingering o'er the scene Of false but real woe,—slowly descend The curtain's massy folds, and, to the sound Of distant music, one by one withdraws Each glittering pomp, till dark before us hangs A funeral pall, as if in mockery Of this poor world;—so from my spirit's eye My dream withdrew, and to the still repose Of midnight left me. SONNETS. [I. If on the clustering curls of thy dark hair] If on the clustering curls of thy dark hair, And the pure arching of thy polished brow, We only gaze, we fondly dream that thou Art one of those bright ministers who bear, Along the cloudless bosom of the air, Sweet, solemn words, to which our spirits bow, With such a holy smile thou lookest now, And art so soft and delicately fair. A veil of tender light is mantling o'er thee; Around thy opening lips young loves are playing; And crowds of youths, in passionate thought delaying, Pause, as thou movest by them, to adore thee; By many a sudden blush and tear betraying How the heart trembles, when it bends before thee. [II. Oh! I could wish I sat upon yon cloud] Oh! I could wish I sat upon yon cloud, Moving with such a silent flight away, And pure, as if it were an angel's shroud, And bright, as if it were the veil of day. Silently on the wind it passes by, And o'er the mountain glides, and comes no more; So, when a few short days are gone, shall I Glide to a dim and undiscovered shore. O, thou art pure and beautiful, sweet form! Who softly movest by me in the light Of thy young beauty, as upon the storm Falls, with a fainter tint, the bow of night: Thy way is to a better world, and there Thou lookest as a cloud that smiles at even. O, be to me that cloud, and kindly bear My spirit with thee to thy own pure heaven. [III. Thy form may fade, but thou wilt not all die] Thy form may fade, but thou wilt not all die, For love with thee is deathless. Thou wilt be Dear, as thou ever hast been, unto me, For thou wilt ever have the speaking eye; And that alone is beauty, and it tells How many fond affections burn within; And it too hath a magic power to win, By the enchantment of its living spells. Only with that fond heart, and that dark eye, Thy love will ever guide me, and control My spirit to thy gentle sympathy; And as the needle trembles to the pole, So shall my heart for ever to thee fly, The centre and attraction of my soul. [IV. If, when I look on thee, and hear thy voice] If, when I look on thee, and hear thy voice In a low-whispered melody alone, When it is breathing in its softest tone, All the deep feelings of my heart rejoice,— O, what were it to sit beside thee long, And gaze on thy bright looks and thy dark eyes, And hear thy tender words and thy sweet song, As sweet as if it floated from the skies! O, what were it to know that thou art mine, Indissolubly mine!—that thou wilt be For ever as an angel unto me, Whether the day be dark, or fortune shine, Giving me, in the bliss of loving thee, A portion of the bliss they call divine. [V. Calm look of gentleness!—I see thee now] Calm look of gentleness!—I see thee now, Even in the dead of night I see thee. Fair Thou movest like a spirit through the air, And there is light unearthly on thy brow,— Yes, by that smile, it can be only thou; For as the fresh dew trembling on the rose, When first the silken leaves their red unclose, Or as the jewel on the frosted bough, So bright and pure thy tender look of love; And as thou hoverest over me, my heart Beats gentler, and I feel my spirit play Light as a linnet on his airy way; And as thy blue eyes look on me, they dart The soft and winning glances of the dove. [VI. Green herbs and flowers new opening, ye have known] Green herbs and flowers new opening, ye have known The soft hand that once gathered you, and made Of your bright leaves and tender stalks a braid, To crown those angel looks, which long have flown. Ere the warm wind from off the sea had blown, And waked the sleeping buds among the bowers, She loved to pluck the pale and soft-eyed flowers Of tint so purely fading, like her own. These were her chosen woodlands, where she paid The tribute of her spirit to the Power Whose voice is heard in every wind that blows, Whose tears descend in every vernal shower, And as they trickle through the mantling shade, A stream of life and love and beauty flows. [VII. O Love! thou art a pure and holy thing] O Love! thou art a pure and holy thing, And none should ever dare to breathe thy name Whose hearts are lit not with as bright a flame As sunward burns around the eagle's wing: O, let me not unworthy offerings bring To one, whose all-commanding power can tame Each vagrant wish, and stamp the brand of shame, Where the least stains of earthly passion cling: Then let me gather from my inmost heart Pure feelings, that from infancy have slept, Silent as waters in a hidden well; And to the gentle offering then impart The fire and tears that Sappho breathed and wept, When her faint cithern gave its dying swell. [When the woodlands are covered with leaves and flowers] When the woodlands are covered with leaves and flowers, In the loveliest time of the year; When the sky is now clear, and now checkered with showers, And life rambles on through the warm sunny hours, Undimmed with a shade or a tear; O, sweet are the feelings that kindle and burn As we gaze on the flowers and the sky; But to higher and purer devotion they turn, As water takes tint from the hue of its urn, When they burn in the light of thine eye And when, in the calm of a moonshiny night, A serenade steals o'er the bay, As it curls in the smile of her mellowest light, Or lies in its beauty, as silent and bright As it slept in the sunshine of day,— O, sweet is the clear and silvery tone, As it softly comes over my ear; But sweet as it breathes when I hear it alone, It breathes like a flute by a wind-spirit blown, When I know thou art listening near. O, the music and beauty of life lose their worth, When one heart only joys in their smile; But the union of hearts gives that pleasure its birth, Which beams on the darkest and coldest of earth, Like the sun on his own chosen isle; It gives to the fireside of winter the light, The glow, and the glitter of spring. O, sweet are the hours when two fond hearts unite, And softly they glide, in their innocent flight, Away on a motionless wing. SPRING. Again the infant flowers of Spring Call thee to sport on thy rainbow wing. Spirit of beauty! the air is bright With the boundless flow of thy mellow light; The woods are ready to bud and bloom, And are weaving for Summer their quiet gloom; The tufted brook reflects, as it flows, The tips of the half-unopened rose, And the early bird, as he carols free, Sings to his little love and thee, See how the clouds, as they fleetly pass, Throw their shadowy veil on the darkening grass; And the pattering showers and stealing dews, With their starry gems and skyey hues, From the oozy meadow, that drinks the tide, To the sheltered vale on the mountain side, Wake to a new and fresher birth The tenderest tribes of teeming earth, And scatter with light and dallying play Their earliest flowers on the Zephyr's way. He comes from the mountain's piny steep, For the long boughs bend with a silent sweep; And his rapid steps have hurried o'er The grassy hills to the pebbly shore; And now, on the breast of the lonely lake, The waves in silvery glances break, Like a short and quickly-rolling sea, When the gale first feels its liberty, And the flakes of foam, like coursers, run, Rejoicing beneath the vertical sun. He has crossed the lake, and the forest heaves, To the sway of his wings, its billowy leaves, And the downy tufts of the meadow fly In snowy clouds, as he passes by, And softly beneath his noiseless tread The odorous spring-grass bends its head; And now he reaches the woven bower, Where he meets his own beloved flower, And gladly his wearied limbs repose In the shade of the newly-opening rose. THE REIGN OF MAY. I feel a newer life in every gale; The winds that fan the flowers, And with their welcome breathings fill the sail, Tell of serener hours,— Of hours that glide unfelt away Beneath the sky of May. The spirit of the gentle south-wind calls From his blue throne of air, And where his whispering voice in music falls, Beauty is budding there; The bright ones of the valley break Their slumbers and awake. The waving verdure rolls along the plain, And the wide forest weaves, To welcome back its playful mates again, A canopy of leaves; And from its darkening shadow floats A gush of trembling notes. Fairer and brighter spreads the reign of May; The tresses of the woods With the light dallying of the west-wind play, And the full-brimming floods, As gladly to their goal they run, Hail the returning sun. TRUE GREATNESS. There is a fire, that has its birth Above the proudest hills of earth; And higher than the eternal snows, The fountain whence it rose. It came to man in ancient days, And fell upon his ardent gaze, A god descending in his car, The spirit of a star. And as the glorious vision broke Full on his eye, at once he woke, And with the rush of battling steeds He sprang to generous deeds. Then first he stood erect and free, And in the might of destiny A stern, unconquerable fate Compelled him to be great. He strove not for the wreath of fame; From Heaven the power that moved him came, And welcome as the mountain air The voice that bade him dare. Onward he bore, and battled still With a most firm, enduring will; His only hope, to win and rise, His only aim, the skies. He saw their glories blaze afar; A soul looked down from every star; And from its eye of lightning flew A glance, that thrilled him through. Full in the front of war he stood; His home, his country, claimed his blood: Without one sigh that blood was given; He only thought—of heaven. [There is nothing can equal the tender hours] There is nothing can equal the tender hours, When life is first in bloom; When the heart, like a bee in a wild of flowers, Finds everywhere perfume; When the present is all, and it questions not If those flowers shall pass away, But, pleased with its own delightful lot, Dreams never of decay. O, it dreams not the hue that freshly glows On the cheek shall ever flee, And fade away like the summer rose, Or the crimson on the sea, When far in the west the setting sun Goes down in the kindled main, And the colors vanish one by one, But never revive again. O, life in its springtime dances on In smiles and innocent tears; It casts not a look to the moments gone, But hails the coming years; They shine before its fancy's eye, Like eastern visions bright, Gay as the hues in the western sky At the coming on of night. Thus happy in all their bosoms feel, And in all their fancy dreams, Their quiet moments onward steal Like the silent flow of streams, Gliding through tufted flowers away To the far and unknown sea; So on with a flight that cannot stay Their days of innocence flee. But soon, too soon their hearts shall know, The future was falsely bright, And its gay and far-deluding glow Shall change to the gloom of night; O, then with a fond and lingering eye They shall turn to the early hours, When life, as their moments hurried by, Was a wild of sweets and flowers. [Dear moments of childhood! how sweetly ye smile] Dear moments of childhood! how sweetly ye smile, As I gaze on the vista of years that are gone! Ye smile in your innocent loveliness, while In the downhill of life we are hastening on. O, could I return to your beautiful prime, When ye shone like the morn of a clear summer day, And my spirit ne'er thought how the footsteps of time, Like the flight of an eagle, were hastening away; O, could I return to those innocent hours, When my heart knew no sorrow, that fled not as soon As the soft drops of April that fall upon flowers, And vanish at once in the bright air of noon;— O, then I might taste of the silent delight That beams in the eye of an infant, and flows As peacefully on as the dove in her flight, Or the dew stealing out of the cup of a rose; O, then I might lay all my sorrows at rest, And be calm as the first whispered zephyr of spring, When it comes on its pinions of down from the west, And shakes the soft fragrance of May from its wing; O, then I might know what it is to be free From a burden that presses a heart to the grave, Might charm back the feeling of lightness and glee, The first look of love and of gentleness gave. But no,—I have passed from the fresh blooming shore, Where life gathers round it its verdure and flowers; I can fondly look backward,—but ah! never more Can I taste of your sweetness, ye innocent hours! Then whither—ah, whither escape from the night, Which darkens more deeply, the farther I go! Look out from the gloom, some benevolent light! Like a star on the traveller who wanders below. A light now is breaking,—it comes from above,— Still clearer and purer than life's early dawn; It descends with the motionless flight of a dove, And guides me in safety and cheerfulness on. Then let me not turn to the innocent hours Of childhood, when brighter hours wait me before; There are thorns in life's earliest and tenderest flowers, But yonder are flowers that shall sting me no more. [Come from thy home in the far blue sky] Come from thy home in the far blue sky, Spirit of beauty and love and song! Hang on thy airy pinions nigh, When the dreams of my wayward fancy throng; Give them a brighter and gayer hue, Shape them to forms of finer mould, Fairer than ever painter drew, Brighter than all the gods of old. Lead me to that delicious clime, Where the anana swells and glows; Lay me beneath the flowering lime, Where the dew in drops of nectar flows: There let the visions of beauty rise, And float in fairy trains away, Bright as their own unclouded skies, And rich as the parting light of day. Bring to my heart the melting tone, Once so sweet to my lingering ear; Though the days of youth have flown, Still that tone to my heart is dear. Now it seems to murmur by, Soft as the wind in a bed of flowers; Now the falling whispers die,— Gone is the dream of my fairest hours. Dimly the visions of beauty fade, Like the cloud that melts in the evening air, When its colors vanish shade by shade, Till the blue of the sky alone is there; Ere they have wholly faded, throw, Spirit of beauty! one glance to me, Bright as the last and fullest glow Of the setting sun on the golden sea. [Thou hast come from thy home in the far blue sky] Thou hast come from thy home in the far blue sky, To dwell in the bosom of flowery dells; Thou hast laid thy mantle of glory by, With its heavenly hues and magic spells; Thou hast wrapped thee in weeds of sober gray, And simply braided thy flowing hair, And thy locks in fond and amorous play Sport with the soft and balmy air. From thy wintry hall in the evening cloud, Where gathered thy pomp of airy hues, And thine eye, from the folds of thy golden shroud, Looked down on the glistening of frozen dews, Where each drop, like a bright, particular star, Caught the iris colors around thy throne, And the moon, as she mounted the hills afar, On a world of seeded silver shone,— From thy glittering hall in the lonely sky, Thou hast come to dwell in the tangled bower, Where a stealing brook is murmuring by, And bathing the roots of herb and flower. Here thy beneficent hand shall throw Its thousand hues o'er the budding plain, Till we dream the clouds, in their sunset glow, Have melted in showers of golden rain. [Soul of the lyre and song!] Soul of the lyre and song! Who comest from the blue and boundless air, And bearest me along To read the starry glories gathered there,— Who callest from the deep The spirits of the long departed dead, To move in gallant sweep, And proud array, above their honored bed: Whether from air or sea Thy voice is uttered, or from mountain heights, Where the hawk hovers free, And morn and evening hang their thousand lights,— Whether from cove or stream Bosomed in shady forests, where of old To the rapt prophet's dream A tale of visionary pomp was told,— 'T is the one stirring breath That moves through every creature, urging on The warrior to death, The bard to give to fame the victory won. [I looked on the broad setting sun] I looked on the broad setting sun, When his flight through the wide heaven was done, And the waves glowing bright with his fire Rose around like a funeral pyre. I watched the red twilight decay, When its tints melted slowly away, Till the light of the soft evening-star Looked out on the blue sea afar. I saw it hang low in the west, Till it sank on the ocean's calm breast, And it seemed, as its brightness grew dim, In the mirror of waters to swim. I turned and beheld a new day From the low-lying clouds burst away, And its light on their wreathed volumes throw, Till they rolled like a deluge of snow. I followed the round, ruddy moon, Till she stood at the height of her noon, And watched her deep blushes expire, As she rose on the blue heaven higher. I saw the far ocean grow bright With the flow of her mellowest light, And the waves, in their long-rolling swell, Caught her smile as they mounted and fell. I marked, as her pale-tinted ray In the first flush of dawn died away, Broad pillars of fire dart again From the breast of the kindling main. Then the sea flashed, like gold, in its flow, And the clouds caught the beautiful glow, Till the sun from the wide ocean came, Like a god in his chariot of flame. [Thou glorious spirit of life and love!] Thou glorious spirit of life and love! There is not a leaf or flower, That spreads to the sun, when meadow and grove Awake with the April shower,— There is not a creature that walks the earth, And is glad in his liberty, But feels and knows, from his earliest birth, How his being is full of thee. The waters, that fall from the mountain's brow, Or in verdurous valleys flow; The waves, that around the gallant prow In the noon-light flash and glow; The sea, as it heaves from the line to the pole, In calm or in tempest—free, Feels deep in its heart the enlivening soul,— The ocean is full of thee. The clouds that hang in the evening sky, And burn with the setting sun; The glorious beings who meet on high When the light of day is done; The brightness that fills the boundless blue, When the shades of twilight flee,— O, the quickening air with its rain and dew,— The air is full of thee. [Where hast thou been on thy rainbow wing] “Where hast thou been on thy rainbow wing, Soul of the light and festive song?” “I have been where around the magic spring The spirits of love and beauty throng; There, to the sound of languishing airs, They wheel their dance on the moon-lit well, And every breath of the night-wind bears Through wilds of roses the warbled spell; Then it silently steals away, Like a floating bird, when the sea is calm, And the lingering breeze, with a fond delay, Hovers around those bowers of balm: Thence on my rainbow wing I flew, To bear this bud of a rose to thee; Never a fairer blossom blew, Than this when it opens its leaves shall be.” “Whither is now thy airy flight?” “Over the blue and boundless ocean, Where it lifts, to embrace the setting light, Its golden waves with a softest motion: Far to the pictured west I fly, Where the wings of the spirits of fire are glancing, And their radiant forms on the kindled sky, Like sparks in a stormy sea, are dancing: Thither I go, and I soon return, When my torch is lit in the fount of glory, That thy pen with a hallowed glow may burn, When thou givest the names of the good to story. “Then I will bring, from the coral cave, Flowers of a brighter and purer hue Than ever Hesperian gardens gave, Or drank from the sky its tender blue; Down in the fathomless deep they lie, Tufted with leaves of glassy green, And their pearly tints, like the opening sky Through the rift of a cloud, look out between; Some shall mimic the setting sun, Or the reddening glow of a distant fire, And in some every tint shall blend and run, Like the mingling sounds on a trembling wire; These I will pluck from the coral cave, In the silent depths of the tropic sea; Then the treasures of earth and sky and wave Shall be borne on my rainbow wing to thee. “Then I will bend my airy flight, From my wanderings, back to the magic well, Where the gentle spirits, who love the light Of the moon, in its fullest beauty, dwell; There, when the fountain bubbles over, Shedding a soft and vapory dew, Their glistening wings, as around they hover In the silvery cloud, shall quiver through; Whether I fly to the setting sun, Or down in the depths of ocean roam, Still I seek, when my flight is done, In the wild of flowers, my cherished home.” THE SPIRIT OF LIFE. From the flowery isles of the southern sea, Where the fulness of life for ever flows, Where the waters are ever gliding free, And the ripened fruit by its blossom glows: From the region of light and wooing gales, Where the plumed wanderer loves to roam, And glad, as the fair wind fills his sails, Bounds over the wave to his unseen home: From the flowery isles of the southern sea, Where life seems one long and glad repose, And the savage beneath his sheltering tree No fairer and happier being knows; Where he wakes to a clear and cloudless day With the notes of the earliest matin-song, And silently dreams the hours away, Or hurries to join the sportive throng: From those flowery and happy Elysian isles, Where the ocean kisses the coral shore, And, spread like a silvery mirror, smiles, Nor ever awakes to the whirlwind's roar; Where the halcyon ever might fold its wing, And float on the calm and silent sea, And wide the joyous mariner fling His sails to the wind's full mastery: I come from those blest Elysian isles, With the dews of life in my brimming urn; Young Spring at my bidding wakes and smiles, And the infant blushes of Beauty burn; A thousand busy and joyous wings O'er meadow and forest my treasures bear, And Health, in her innocent gladness, flings New-braided wreaths from her flowing hair: All waken and brighten where'er I go, Like the hearts that welcome a festive day, And happy creatures around me flow, Like the crowds that greet a conqueror's way. [Spirit of high and mighty souls!] Spirit of high and mighty souls! Thine is the darkly hovering cloud, Deep in whose heart the thunder rolls, With a murmuring echo long and loud; Thine the gulf where the cataract pours With a sudden rush its emerald tide; Thine the height where the eagle soars, And the winds in their stormy chariots ride: Thine the unbounded world of waves, Bursting aloft with fiery foam; Thine the fearless bark, that braves Danger and death on its ocean home; Thine the mountains that gird the pole, Wreathed like a starry crown of light,— These are the haunts of the mighty soul,— Thither it bends its daring flight. But by the side of the hidden spring Shaded with newly-budding flowers, Where the butterfly floats on its filmy wing, And the rose breathes sweetlier after showers; But in the cool, sequestered shade, At the lonely foot of a wooded hill, Where a low and pleasing din is made By the dash of the brook at the village mill; But in the colored sky at even, When the glorious tints are fading away, And shapes like the missioned spirits of heaven Round the top of the gilded forest play; But by the sweep of the silent river, Where its waters in gentle stillness roll, Like the tides of eternity, ruffled never;— O, these are the haunts of the tender soul. [Had I the pinions of an eagle's wing] Had I the pinions of an eagle's wing, In the pure mountain air, Poised like a glorious and celestial thing, My soul afar should fling Its glances there. Above the midway haunt of clouds and storms, In the bright summer sun, Whose tempered influence kindles, as it warms, O'er beauty's fairest forms My eye should run. There all that dims and darkens fades away; One flow of mellow light, Fresh as the newly-risen beam of day, In ever-varying play, Makes all things bright. The woods that wave below in tufted green, The meadows pranked with flowers, The pebbly brooks that wind in light between, Glad as their blushing queen Descends in showers,— From the clear height of that aerial throne, Heaved like a prop of heaven, Towering in solitary pride alone, Where never storms have blown, Nor clouds were driven,— Seen from that airy tower, so far below, They swim in waving gold, As when the misty hills at evening glow, And light in liquid flow On earth is rolled. On the far confines of the bending sky, Where ocean melts in air, Light curls of snowy vapors hover by, And azure islands lie In slumber there. Like halcyons floating on the silent sea, With wings of skyey hue Shading their weary eyes,—so tranquilly They take, bright heaven! from thee Thy purest blue. There as I gaze, I feel a gentle power Steal through my heart, and lay Its cares at rest, as when the dewy shower Freshens at night the flower That drooped by day. ON THE DEATH OF ?. I shed no tear upon thy early grave, For thy pure soul has found deliverance now, And from the eminence that Nature gave Looks down upon a world that sought to bow, With a low burden of consuming cares, Thy spirit to the reach of theirs. Thou wert not fashioned for the menial throng, Who plod with easy step the common way, But thy delight was in the sons of song, And, sooth, to play On the light strings of some unearthly lyre Was all thy office, and thy sole desire. Thy spirit could not brook the common lot. Not that it wore the plume and crest of pride, For the meek tenant of a shepherd's cot Went as a loved companion by thy side; But all thy thoughts were lent, With a perpetual bent, To meditations of an unknown sphere, And therefore life below Seemed all too lag and slow, And every look was cold that met thee here; So thou didst keep thy melancholy way, With earnest longing for a brighter day. And it has come,—and now a loftier air Encompasses about thy liberal soul: The welcome winds that blow around thee bear Sounds that from fitly-chiming planets roll, And now thy all-attentive spirit hears The harmony of spheres; Thy path is now through amaranth beds, and lines Of laurel, such as crown the chosen few, Whose tuneful company in glory shines Bathed with large offerings of Castalian dew, That from a golden overshadowing cloud In full effusion flows, And, while their harps and voices echo loud, Breathes round the living perfume of the rose. And now, admitted to their willing train, Thou standest high upon the starry floor, And thou shalt walk on that cerulean plain Inlaid with burning gems and sparkling ore: Thou shalt behold no more The clouds that overshade our darker day, For they have rolled away. Like a bright jewel in a coronet, Or, fitter simile, a rolling star, Imperial Jove in his eternal car, In the full front of Heaven's armada set, That ride the airy sea, Spreading without a limit or a shore, And, stead of rush and roar, Moving to a most gentle harmony,— Thus bright, and thus upheld in port and place, Thou shalt maintain thy station evermore, And, with such lofty grace As Theron erst the palmy garland wore, Bear on thy youthful brow the immortal bay, And so thy fame shall never pass away. Then why should we with long and vain lament Weep o'er thy early fate, as if it were Inflicted on thee with no good intent, But dropped unkindly from the infected air? Rather be glad, for 't is the blessed care Of some benevolent power, Whose wont it is with open hand to shower His liberal gifts, that thou so soon hast given Thy spirit to the full embrace of Heaven. THE LAST DAYS OF AUTUMN. Now the growing year is over, And the shepherd's tinkling bell Faintly from its winter cover Rings a low farewell:— Now the birds of Autumn shiver, Where the withered beech-leaves quiver, O'er the dark and lazy river, In the rocky dell. Now the mist is on the mountains, Reddening in the rising sun; Now the flowers around the fountains Perish one by one:— Not a spire of grass is growing, But the leaves that late were glowing Now its blighted green are strowing With a mantle dun. Now the torrent brook is stealing Faintly down the furrowed glade,— Not as when, in winter pealing, Such a din it made, That the sound of cataracts falling Gave no echo so appalling, As its hoarse and heavy brawling In the pine's black shade. Darkly blue the mist is hovering Round the clifted rock's bare height, All the bordering mountains covering With a dim, uncertain light:— Now, a fresher wind prevailing, Wide its heavy burden sailing, Deepens, as the day is failing, Fast the gloom of night. Slow the blood-stained moon is riding Through the still and hazy air, Like a sheeted spectre gliding In a torch's glare:— Few the hours her light is given,— Mingling clouds of tempest driven O'er the mourning face of heaven, All is blackness there. THE SOUL OF SONG. Where lives the soul of song? Dwells it amid the city's festive halls? Where crowd the eager throng, Or where the wanderer's silent footstep falls? Loves it the gay saloon, Where wine and dances steal away the night, And bright as summer noon Burns round the pictured walls a blaze of light? Seeks it the public square, When victory hails the people's choson son, And loud applauses there From lip to lip in emulous greetings run? Dwells it amid the host, Who bear their crimson banners waving high; Whose first and only boast Draws tears of anguish from the patriot's eye? Follows it on the path Where the proud conqueror marches to his home, And, wearied of his wrath, Smiles as he steps beneath the imperial dome? No,—not in festive halls, In crowded marts, nor in the gay saloon; Not in the forum falls, Nor on the conquering host, the gracious boon; But where blue mountains rise Silent and calm amid the upper air, And pure and cloudless skies Bend o'er a world, that lies below as fair; But where uncultured plains Spread far and wide their beds of grass and flowers, And heaven's bright pencil stains Clear gems that roll away in silent showers; But in the depth of woods, Where the slant sunbeam gilds the hoary trees, And the soft voice of floods Glides on the pinions of the evening breeze; But in the broken dell, Where the crisped ivy curls its tangled vines, And the wild blossom's bell Drops with the dew that in its hollow shines; But in the gulfy cave, Where pours the cascade from the glacier's height, And all its waters wave, Like rainbows, in their luxury of light;— There dwells the soul of song: It flies not to the city's festive halls, But loves to steal along, Where the lone wanderer's silent footstep falls. MORNING TWILIGHT. The mountains are blue in the morning air, And the woods are sparkling with dewy light; The winds, as they wind through the hollows, bear The breath of the blossoms that wake by night. Wide o'er the bending meadows roll The mists, like a lightly moving sea; The sun is not risen,—and over the whole There hovers a silent mystery. The pure blue sky is in calm repose; The pillowy clouds are sleeping there; So stilly the brook in its covert flows, You would think its murmur a breath of air. The water that floats in the glassy pool, Half hid by the willows that line its brink, In its deep recess has a look so cool, One would worship its nymph, as he bent to drink. Pure and beautiful thoughts, at this early hour, Go off to the home of the bright and blest; They steal on the heart with an unseen power, And its passionate throbbings are laid at rest; O, who would not catch, from the quiet sky And the mountains that soar in the hazy air, When his harbinger tells that the sun is nigh, The visions of bliss that are floating there! [Where are now the flowers that once detained me] “The memory of joys that are past.”— Ossian. Where are now the flowers that once detained me, Like a loiterer on my early way? Where the fragrant wreaths that softly chained me, When young life was like an infant's play? Were they but the fancied dreams, that hover Round the couch where tender hearts repose? Only pictured veils, that brightly cover With their skyey tints a world of woes? They are gone,—but memory loves to cherish All their sweetness in her deepest core. Ah! the recollection cannot perish, Though the eye may never meet them more. There are hopes, that like enchantment brighten Gayly in the van of coming years; They are never met,—and yet they lighten, When we walk in sorrow and in tears. When the present only tells of anguish, Then we know their worth, and only then: O, the wasted heart will cease to languish, When it thinks of joys that might have been! Age and suffering and want may sever Every link, that bound to life, in twain: Hope—even hope may vanish, but for ever Memory with her visions will remain. INSPIRATION. Glorious creatures! Shapes of light! Where are now those looks of power? Where the eyes that glistened bright, In my visionary hour? Ye were fair, and ye were high; Far, too far away from earth; Shadowy pinions hovered nigh, When my fancy gave you birth. I was in a trance of heaven; Spirits then would come and go: Where the eternal walls were riven, Rushed a dazzling overflow. I was then, on sounding wings, Borne along the living air; All of bright and beauteous things, All of great and good, were there. Not a sound, but seemed to tell Harmony and holy love; Every echo gently fell, Like an answer from above. Then the soul assumed its reign; Then it stood erect and bold; All it sought so long in vain, Then in torrents round it rolled. With a full and sudden rush, Thought and light and knowledge came, Like an instantaneous gush From the purest fount of flame. Thick as atoms in the sun, Dancing on the dusty way, Thousand sparkles seemed to run, Meeting, mingling into day. 'T was the spirit's jubilee; Passion sprang, and rent his chain, Mounting into ecstasy, Bright and free from every stain. Visions, many as the stars, Glowing like a summer even, Proud as victors on their cars, Heralded my way to heaven. REMORSE. I am banished from home and from heaven, Like the rush of a thunderbolt driven; Ever blacker the night sinks before me, And louder the storm rages o'er me; A whirlwind behind me is rushing, And torrents around me are gushing: My flight must be onward for ever, And a rest from my wandering be never. My proud heart is broken and saddened; My brain, like a scorpion, maddened, When a circle of flame has fast bound him, And death is within and around him; My hopes are all scattered and flying, And the last pulse that stirred me is dying: Of memory no time can bereave me; It may torture, but never will leave me. O, where the ambition that hovered, Till its pinions with glory were covered! Where the hopes, ever fonder and lighter, Like the morning sun brighter and brighter! Where the fancy that colored and painted, Till the picture was hallowed and sainted, And the love, a devoted adorer, That bent in his ecstasy o'er her! O, these were my forfeited heaven! But few were the days they were given: And now, like a wanderer benighted, Every blossom and bud torn and blighted, In the regions of darkness and sorrow, Forbidden the hope of a morrow, From all that was dear I must sever, And rush to my ruin for ever. Now rage, like a hurricane, wings me, And the goading of memory stings me; If I look for a moment behind me, The arrows of thought sear and blind me; The far-echoed music of gladness Now stirs me to fury and madness, And the fame that once wooed me now spurns me, And its brightness now scorches and burns me. Then welcome the rush and the roaring, And the storm that is bursting and pouring, And the darkness that thickens around me, As if earth in its centre had bound me; Better onward through chaos be driven, Than be scared by the frowning of heaven, Though a rest from my wandering be never, And my flight be for ever and ever. A FANCY-PIECE. I found thee where the woods were wild, And weeds and thorns had round thee grown; No hunter's foot, no wandering child, Had met thee, thou wert all so lone. Above, the cypress and the yew Had wreathed around their funeral shade, And the still wind, that faintly blew, A sound, like that of sorrow, made. And ever, as it o'er thee swept, Low-breathing melodies were heard, As if a mourner sobbed and wept, Or nightly sang the widowed bird. And now, as fitfully the blast Shook the tossed branches overhead, A voice like that of terror passed, And like a midnight vision fled. And then again a mingled tone Of all sweet echoes met my ear, Sweet as, when storms are over blown, The warm south-wind comes stealing near; Sweet as the closing breath of even, When wet with dews her pinions fall, And, like a messenger of Heaven, Night comes, and whispers peace to all. I took thee from thy sylvan haunt, And brought thee to the cultured plain, And saw thee flourish, like a plant Nursed by the dews and kindly rain. And there was music round thee still, And it was sweet—O, sweeter far! Like voices echoed from the hill, When Love has lit his trembling star: Or like the fluttering airs in May, Stealing among the musky flowers, And bearing mingled sweets away From pansied beds and orange bowers: A sound, that with the fretting stream, And feeding flocks, and murmuring bees, Blent, like the closing of a dream, In undistinguished harmonies. And ever, as the mounting sun Shone broader in the summer heaven, Voices and symphonies would run, In hurried chords around thee driven. And then the melody was high, Like organs pealing through a choir, Or thunders mingling in the sky, Or like the distant roar of fire,— A solemn, tempered tone, that gave A shuddering, not unmixed with joy, As when the proud, unshrinking boy Fears, and yet breasts the bursting wave. And ever as the loftier swell Sank from its airy throne, there came Soft utterings of peace, that fell Silently breathing one loved name. Still loftier grew the master-song, And sweeter stole the under-tone, When suddenly there rolled along Rude storms, and every breath had flown. Silent and cold I saw thee lay Thy honors and thy hopes aside, And slowly, faintly sink away, Slow as the long-retiring tide. The breath of spring to thee was balm, And summer gave thee light and love; Thy leaves were green, when air was calm, And heaven dropped blessings from above. But when the hills are bleak and bare, Thou canst not stand the open plain; But rather thou wouldst wither where I found thee, in thy woods, again. SPIRIT OF MAY. Welcome, thrice welcome, Spirit of May! Blessings be round thy airy way; Come, with thy train of rainbow hues, Of hovering clouds and falling dews,— Come to our garden beds and bowers, And cover them over with leaves and flowers. Already the summer bird is there, And he sings aloud to the warm, warm air; There he carols strong and free, And his song and his joy are all for thee. Come when the sparkling rivers run, Full and bright, to the gladdening sun; Come, when the grass and springing corn In their newest and tenderest green are born; When budding woods and tufted hills Wake to the music of foaming rills, As they rush from their fountains deep and strong, And in calm and in sunshine roll along; Come, when the soft and winning air Tells us a quickening life is there. Come to our bosoms, Spirit of May! We would not be sad when the earth is gay; Wake, in the heart that is newly strung, The love that dwells with the fair and young; Give, to their full and speaking eyes, Visions that glitter like sunset skies; Waft them with quick and favoring gales, Filling with music their glancing sails; Theirs be a flight o'er a summer sea, Where nothing of cloud or storm can be. And give us, who long have bode the storm, To feel for a moment our spirits warm; Let the hopes, that once were a world of light, Look out from our sorrows serene and bright, Like stars that come forth from the midnight air, When the cloud has passed and the sky is fair; Give us awhile to forget our cares, And be light as thy own enlivening airs; Let feelings of childhood awake like flowers, When they open to catch the falling showers. Come from thy palace, Spirit of May! Where flowers ever blossom and fountains play; Bring with thee Plenty's brimming horn, And the tears of evening and dews of morn; Build thy throne in the clear, blue air, And earth shall be bright, and heaven be fair, And the winds that rushed from the rolling cloud, And lifted their voices and called aloud, Shall sink to a softer and mellower tone, Like gales from a happy island blown. Then the sea shall glow in its darkest bed, And life shall revisit the mountain head; And the valley shall laugh, and the forest ring, For Joy shall be out on his glittering wing; And the old shall pause, and the young shall stare, As they hear his voice in the sunny air; Glad shall their hearts and their spirits be, When they know he is sent to tell of thee,— To tell them, the Queen of Love and May Is now on her bright, triumphal way. [Shall I gather the rose of the mountain] Shall I gather the rose of the mountain, Or the violet low in the vale, Or the birch bending over the fountain, Or the flower that wakes up with the gale? Shall I bring thee the pink-colored blossom, That closes its leaves on the rain, Or the petals that open their bosom To the night, and are lovely in vain? The violet is sweet in the valley, And the wind-flower that welcomes the gale; And the birch, where the bright waters sally, Tells the night-wind a murmuring tale. Not the sun-loving flower of the dry land Do I choose, nor the blossom that blows In the moon, but I go to the highland, And pluck from the mountain the rose. TO A SHIP, ON GOING TO SEA. The gallant ship is out at sea, Proudly o'er the water going; Along her sides the billows flee, Back in her wake, a river, flowing: She dips her stem to meet the wave, And high the tossed foam curls before it; As if she felt the cheers we gave, She takes her flight, Where the sea looks bright, And the sun in sparkles flashes o'er it. Gallantly on she cuts her way, And now in distance far is fleeting; There are some on board whose hearts are gay, And some whose hearts are wildly beating: Loud was the cheer her seamen gave, As back they sent our welcome cheering; Many a hand was seen to wave, And some did weep, And fondly keep Their gaze intent when out of hearing. They have parted, and now are far at sea,— Heaven send them fair and gentle weather! They part not for eternity; Our hands shall soon be linked together: The sea was smooth, and the sky was blue, And the tops of the ruffled waves were glowing, As proudly on the vessel flew, Like the feathered king, On his balanced wing, To a distant land o'er the ocean going. APOSTROPHE TO THE ISLAND OF CUBA. NOVEMBER, 1822. There is blood on thy desolate shore, Thou island of plunder and slaves! Thy billows are purpled with gore, And murder has crimsoned thy waves; The vengeance of nations will come, And wrath shall be rained on thy head, And in terror thy voice shall be dumb, When they ask for their brothers who bled. Thy hand was not stirred when their life-blood was spilt; And therefore that hand must partake in the guilt. Thou art guilty or weak,—and the rod Should be wrenched from thy palsied hand; By the pirate thy green fields are trod, And his steps have polluted thy land; Unmoved is thy heart and thine eye, When our dear ones are tortured and slain; But their blood, with a terrible cry, Calls on vengeance, and calls not in vain; If Europe regard not, our land shall awake, And thy walls and thy turrets shall tremble and shake. The voice of a world shall be heard, And thy faith shall be tried by the call; And that terrible voice shall be feared, And obeyed,—or the proud one shall fall. Enough of our life has been shed, In watching and fighting for thee; If thy foot linger still, on thy head The guilt and the vengeance shall be: We have sworn that the spirit of Allen shall lead, And our wrath shall not rest till we finish the deed. TO MELANTHE. I saw thee, like a lovely dream,— I heard thy flowery voice,— I saw that eye of mildness beam, And even the air around did seem, In brightness, to rejoice. Thou wert before me, pure and fair, A nymph, a saint, a child Of very loveliness, and there Was glory, such as angels wear, When all that beauty smiled. Thou wert before me, but my heart Was anything but gay,— There was a quick, a sudden start, And then my spirit took no part, But wandered far away. It could not rest in that delight, So natural to thine,— It had been darkling long in night, And it was round thee all too bright, Too gentle, too divine. The thoughts of many hopeless years, Dark, visionary hours, Wild phantoms of unholy fears, The woe that wrings, the grief that sears,— They could not dwell with flowers. Thou hadst a smile for me,—for me. O, would that I had known A friend, a more than friend, like thee, When my young heart was pure and free, When love was newly blown! My life had been a dearer thing,— I had not then despaired; And all the many joys, that fling Their colors round the fleeting wing Of time, been with thee shared. O, thou wert all I could have dreamed, In love's first purple bloom; I saw thee smile, and then it seemed As if a blessed vision beamed, All light and all perfume. The very air was musical,— A glory round thee flowed,— The winds sank to a dying fall, And melody encircled all In that serene abode. It could not last,—it would not stay,— It was not real,—no. Yet thou didst speak to me,—they say Such memories cannot pass away, And it is with me so. That smile,—that smile,—it was not mine; And yet on me it smiled. Would I had met thee so divine, When I could dare to call me thine, A boy, and thou a child! SONNET. Behold yon hills. The one is fresh and fair; The other rudely great. New-springing green Mantles the one; and on its top the star Of love, in all its tenderest light, is seen. Island of joys! how sweet thy gentle rays Issue from heaven's blue depths in evening's prime! But round yon bolder height no softness plays, Nor flower nor bud adorns its front sublime. Rude, but in majesty, it mounts in air, And on its summit Jove in glory burns; 'Mid all the stars that pour their radiant urns, None with that lordly planet may compare. But see, they move; and, tinged with love's own hue, Beauty and Power embrace in heaven's serenest blue. CANZONETS. I. Tell me, heart, O tell me where All my loves and hopes are flown? Ah! to weep and sigh alone Withers all that's fresh and fair. Hours of tenderest pleasure, where, Where have fled your golden dreams? Sorrow now in life's warm streams Mingles cold and wintry care. Youth,—how proud and light it springs, Shouting, “Welcome, flowery May! See, the turtle sleeks his wings, Roses bloom, and fountains play; Earth is full of joyous things!”— Ah! but soon they fade away. II. I die, my love, my treasure! My heart, my soul, I die. O, turn that gentle eye! My ebbing life shall fly Back, in one tide of pleasure. O fairest, sweetest, dearest!— O, soft as any dream, When by the meadow stream Thy loved one's lute thou hearest! I ask one gift, deny not,— Those eyes of living light, O, let them glad my sight! Look hither, love, and fly not. My heart, my heart is beating,— O, hear its fond entreating! O, turn those eyes in kindness,— What if the look be blindness! My prayer, my prayer, deny not. SONNET. [Acrostic tribute (in 1825) to a Boston lady of surpassing beauty.] Earth holds no fairer, lovelier one than thou, Maid of the laughing lip, and frolic eye! Innocence sits upon thy open brow, Like a pure spirit in its native sky. If ever beauty stole the heart away, Enchantress, it would fly to meet thy smile; Moments would seem by thee a summer day, And all around thee an Elysian isle. Roses are nothing to the maiden blush Sent o'er thy cheek's soft ivory, and night Has naught so dazzling in its world of light, As the dark rays that from thy lashes gush. Love lurks amid thy silken curls, and lies Like a keen archer in thy kindling eyes. THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS. In Eastern lands they talk in flowers, And they tell in a garland their loves and cares: Each blossom that blooms in their garden bowers, On its leaves a mystic language bears. The rose is the sign of joy and love,— Young, blushing love in its earliest dawn; And the mildness that suits the gentle dove From the myrtle's snowy flower is drawn. Innocence shines in the lily's bell, Pure as a heart in its native heaven; Fame's bright star, and glory's swell, By the glossy leaf of the bay are given. The silent, soft, and humble heart In the violet's hidden sweetness breathes; And the tender soul that cannot part, A twine of evergreen fondly wreathes. The cypress, that darkly shades the grave, Is sorrow, that mourns her bitter lot; And faith, that a thousand ills can brave, Speaks in thy blue leaves, forget-me-not. Then gather a wreath from the garden bowers, And tell the wish of thy heart in flowers. [Every day I muse upon thee] Every day I muse upon thee: Life and joy thou art to me. If a faithful heart could win thee, Soon my own love thou wouldst be. Ah, how sweet to dwell with thee! Swift my years would glide away; All around would laugh with pleasure; Rich would be the priceless treasure. Art could find no words to say, How my bounding thoughts would play. Let me then be ever nigh thee. Youth shall be our spring of love; Mild as any mother dove, Age shall sit in quiet by thee. Never may misfortune try thee. HOME. My place is in the quiet vale, The chosen haunt of simple thought; I seek not fortune's flattering gale, I better love the peaceful lot. I leave the world of noise and show, To wander by my native brook; I ask, in life's unruffled flow, No treasure but my friend and book. These better suit the tranquil home, Where the clear water murmurs by; And if I wish awhile to roam, I have an ocean in the sky. Fancy can charm and feeling bless With sweeter hours than fashion knows; There is no calmer quietness, Than home around the bosom throws. THE FLIGHT OF TIME. Faintly flow, thou falling river, Like a dream that dies away; Down to ocean gliding ever, Keep thy calm, unruffled way: Time with such a silent motion Floats along on wings of air, To eternity's dark ocean, Burying all its treasures there. Roses bloom, and then they wither; Cheeks are bright, then fade and die; Shapes of light are wafted hither,— Then, like visions, hurry by: Quick as clouds at evening driven O'er the many-colored west, Years are bearing us to heaven, Home of happiness and rest. FADING FLOWERS. Can the rose of summer fade, The bright and blooming rose? Shall winter sweep the glade, Where its tender beauty blows? There is perfume in the air, And it steals from the opening flower; But the winds shall rudely tear The treasures of field and bower. They fade,—how soon they fade, The flowers of earth and sky! Was all that beauty made, To smile a moment and die? O, will not the colors stay, That glow in the west at even, And the hues of the rising day Be ever the charm of heaven? O, let me not think the flowers Shall ever be borne away From the full and loaded bowers, Where they welcome the early day. I would not indulge one thought, That a rose or a cheek could wither; But believe their colors, caught From heaven, shall be wafted thither. MOONLIGHT IN A WOOD. Moonlight is gleaming, Where the brook, streaming Over the bright sands, Winds through the woodlands; Where the trees, bending Lowly, are lending Gloom to the clear flow, Erst in a full glow Under the broad light Of the starred midnight. But now it darkles, Save a few sparkles, Where some stray moonbeam Falls in a pale stream, Or a soft shower, Through the high bower Which the dark wood weaves Close with its young leaves. Then as I view them, Light trembles through them; While far above them, (O, how I love them!) See the stars twinkle, Where the clouds crinkle, And the bright moon sheds Light on the hill-heads, With such fair glances, As when she dances Where the calm ocean, With a soft motion Hushing its roar, Rolls its white breakers, Those wide earth-shakers, Slow to the shore. THE CONTRAST. I saw the fair one pass away, In her earliest beauty's bright array, In the glow of hope and the flush of pride, And the innocent joy of a virgin bride, When her heart, yet pure as the fallen snow, Gave loose to its feelings' fullest flow, And her cheek, as rich as the crimson flower That opens in India's sunny bower, Was hung with curls that danced and flew, As the wind of the morning lightly blew, And swelled the sail of the bark that bore The bride from that loved and lovely shore. O, thus in her maiden beauty gay I saw that fair one pass away! I saw that faded fair return With heart as chill as a marble urn, And cheek of as pale and wan a hue, As a blossom wet by the poison dew, That falls from the leaves of the funeral yew; Her eye had lost its glancing fire, Her cheek the glow of young desire, And she gazed on the home of her tender years With a look too cold for smiles or tears, But a look that told how her peace had flown, And how she was left in her grief alone. Thus pale and still to the shore she drew, As the wind of the morning lightly blew, O, how unlike to the joyous day When she passed in her beauty's pride away! MY NATIVE LAND. O, not the clear and sunny wave That rolls around the Ægean isles; Nor all that ancient beauty gave Of fondest dallyings and smiles; Nor all the spirit-stirring notes That come from high Apollo's shrine, When the full hymn and song divine Round Delphi's golden temple floats;— O, not the hills that bear the vine, And far their breathing odors throw; Not the bright skies, whose evening twine Outvies, in tints, the breded bow; Not all the luxury of shade Beneath the spreading chestnut-tree; Not all the flowers that never fade, Rude land of storms! can equal thee. In thee my infant being drew The first reviving breath of air; My early years in gladness flew, Light as a dream of summer there: Still round thy rocks my spirit clings,— It cannot tear itself away; And if it had an eagle's wings, There it would ever hovering play; For oh! there is no spot of earth Dear as the land that gave us birth. ODE. JULY 4, 1826. Bright day! with thee the song Of Independence rose; Then Freedom, bold and strong, Defied her mortal foes: Armed into life and light she sprung, Like Pallas born of Jove; At Britain's feet the gauntlet flung, And back her champion drove: Young, and yet wise, she won her cause, And war's red banner furled; Then fixed the reign of equal laws, And awed a wondering world. Bright day! with thee our sires Proclaimed Columbia free: Light with auspicious fires This holiest jubilee! 'Mid clouds of war thy sun arose, And danger met thy birth; Now wide and full thy bounty flows, It warms and kindles earth: The Andes redden in thy blaze; Their millions kneel to thee,— They hail thee, earliest born of days, First dawn of Liberty. Earth owns thy influence now: 'T is not the few who dared Refuse to bend and bow When Power's right arm was bared— 'T is not that sacred band who tore The charter and the chain, Then on a nation's altar swore Their birthright to maintain— Now hear a continent proclaim One vow, one prayer, to Heaven, For every foreign lord in shame Back to his home is driven. Then, be thy quickening light Still brighter as it rolls, Till all on earth unite, One band of kindred souls; For ever may thy altar burn With Freedom's holiest flame, And ages after ages turn To venerate thy name. O, never may our sons forget The men who dared be free, And on its firm foundations set Thy temple, Liberty! ODE. CONCORD, APRIL 19, 1825. When first from the land of the tyrant and slave Our forefathers ventured to cross the wide ocean, They kneeled as they came from the perilous wave, And uttered their vows with an earnest devotion: Bright Spirit! in thee We will ever be free, While thy sun gives its light To the land and the sea, And here on the storm-beaten rock we unite To conquer or die for our God and our right. Then deep in their bosoms they nourished the flame That burst from their hearts in the moment of danger, When proudly the minion of tyranny came, Polluting their homes with the foot of the stranger. Then they flew to the fight, Where Liberty's light Called the bold-hearted yeoman To rise in his might, And the hard hand of labor undauntedly gave The welcome of death to the murdering slave. Here first in the red field of battle they stood, And fearlessly gathered the harvest of glory; Here they first stamped the seal of their union in blood, And imprinted their names on the records of story: Here proudly again We meet on the plain Where England first tried To enslave us in vain, And, firm in their purpose, our fathers unfurled Bright Liberty's flag to a wondering world. Here, flushed with the high hopes of Freedom, we join In an act of the purest and deepest devotion. O, long may our children be drawn to this shrine, By an instinct as sure as the tides of the ocean; May they never forget How their forefathers met, And planted the green tree That flourishes yet, But, warm with the spirit of Liberty, raise To the brave hearts who saved us, one chorus of praise. WASHINGTON'S NAME. At the heart of our country the tyrant was leaping, To dye there the point of his dagger in gore, When Washington sprang from the watch he was keeping, And drove back that tyrant in shame from our shore: The cloud that hung o'er us then parted and rolled Its wreaths far away, deeply tinctured with flame; And high on its fold Was a legend that told The brightness that circled our Washington's name. Long years have rolled on, and the sun still has brightened Our mountains and fields with its ruddiest glow; And the bolt that he wielded so proudly, has lightened, With a flash as intense, in the face of the foe: On the land and the sea, the wide banner has rolled O'er many a chief, on his passage to fame; And still on its fold Shine in letters of gold The glory and worth of our Washington's name. And so it shall be, while eternity tarries, And pauses to tread in the footsteps of time; The bird of the tempest, whose quick pinion carries Our arrows of vengeance, shall hover sublime: Wherever that flag on the wind shall be rolled, All hearts shall be kindled with anger and shame, If e'er they are told They are careless and cold, In the glory that circles our Washington's name. LIBERTY. A voice is on our hills, And it echoes far at sea: With a quickening power it fills Every heart, and inly thrills,— 'T is the voice of Liberty. A glance darts from yon cloud, And it frights thee, tyrant,—thee: But the freeman rises proud, And his sire stirs in his shroud,— 'T is the glance of Liberty. A warning calls at night: “Nations, rouse ye, and be free.” They hear it with delight, But the monarch looks affright,— 'T is thy warning, Liberty. There 's a presence in the air, Which we feel, but cannot see; Every bosom gladdens there, High to hope, and strong to dare,— 'T is thy presence, Liberty. The God our hearts adore, Builds his throne on land and sea; He is in the tempest's roar, Or when ocean laps the shore,— That God is Liberty. THE GREEK SONG OF VICTORY. The red day of slaughter is done; The rose tint is pale in the west; The triumph of liberty won, Joy swells each Athenian breast: We have buried our foes in the wave That rolls on our iron-bound shore; And the foot of the Ottoman slave Shall dare scale our ramparts no more: They came in their pride and their pomp to the fight, But have scattered like dust, in the rush of our might. They came with the dawning of day; The sun brightly glanced on their sails, And their fleet, on its conquering way, Bore forward with favoring gales: Like a dark cloud of tempest they came; Already they uttered their yell,— When we let loose our arrows of flame, And the pride of the Mussulman fell: Then the waves with the fire and the slaughter were red, And our prows hurried on through the dying and dead. They are gone,—and the sea rolls again In peace on our iron-bound shore; They have left but the wreck and the stain, Where the green waves heaved purple with gore: As the last light grows dim in the west, O God of the brave and the free! How the fulness that swells in each breast Is poured forth in blessings to thee! For we trusted in thee,—and the arm of thy might Has scattered our foes in the perilous fight. BIRTHDAY OF LINNÆUS. In a temple built by God, The bright and boundless heaven,— Its pavement the green sod, With the woods to wave around, In a harmony of sound, To his favorites only given,— Only given to those ears Who can catch the chiming spheres,— Only given to those hearts Who can feel him in the flowers, Who with high and holy arts Know to steal away the hours From the blank of vulgar men,— We are spirits only then, And with voices pure and free Only then can worship thee,— Then can only at thy throne, Thou unseen, invisible One! At thy throne of earth and air, In the common gladness share Of a universe that smiles Underneath thy quickening ray, As we see at noon of day, Through wide groups of palmy isles. The ocean dance its way. In that temple, wide as earth, And unlimited as air, May the mind who called to birth A creation none may dare With a reckless hand profane,— May he look from out his heaven, And with smiles, like early rain Falling on the joyous flowers, Be among us through these hours, When we meet to weave a crown For his sacerdotal brow. Not to this our spirits bow: A better light came down With thy teaching,—thou didst ever Lead us upward to the Giver. Like the white-robed priest of old, In a mantle pure as light, Thou didst lead us on through night Into nature's deepest fold, Till we caught the fire divine Beaming from the inmost shrine,— Caught the radiance of that sun, Where the spirit dwells alone. 'T is a pure and holy rite, One that loves the blessed light. With a sacrifice of bloom, Rich in colors and perfume, Let the altar now be graced; And that living breath shall rise Unburnt incense to the skies. Be our hearts as free from stain, Thou, invisible One, shalt smile Kindly on our rites, the while. With our dear ones at our side, We are gathered here again, In thy fairest month of May, Our grateful debt to pay To thy servant, and our guide. HOPE OF FAME. To live beyond the grave,—to leave a name, That, like a living sun, shall hold its way Undimmed through ages,—to be hailed hereafter As first among the spirits who have gifted Their land with fame,—to dwell amid the thoughts Of all sublimer souls, as deities Are treasured in their shrines,—to load the tongues Of nations, and be uttered in the songs And prayers of millions;—he who bears such hope Fixed in his heart, and holds his lonely way Cheered by this only, and yet keeps himself Unwavering in the many shocks that push His purpose from its path,—he was not cast In nature's common mould. Such hope itself Is greatness. THE VOICE OF LOVE. “E 'l parlar di dolcezza e di salute.”— Petrarca. There is a voice, and there is only one, Thrilling my bosom, as if tuned on high Amid the spheres revolving round the sky, Whose roll is tempered to the sweetest tone, Whose blended harmonies are heard at night, Now falling distant, now ascending nigh, And with the saffron burst of dawning light Peal like the long, loud clarion-swell of fight, When columns in the deadly charge rush by. As sweet, but fainter, of as a clear a note, Yet softened into calmness, is that sound Whose tones in recollection round me float, Seeming to steal from some enchanted ground, Giving the present to oblivion, throwing Lightly around, in all its beauty glowing, The pictured veil that gave my early days A coming Eden, whose serene delight Shone with a pageant more intensely bright Than all the ever-changing pomp that plays On Iris, when she waves her wings in flight. So bright the tints, when first the vision shone, Rolling its lofty arch o'er all below, From peak to mountain-peak in glory thrown, Resting its pillars on their icy zone, Where myriad streams of liquid amber flow, When the low sun, emerging from the storm, Hangs broad and fiery on the gilded wave, That prouder swells around the godlike form, Who sinks, a conqueror, setting in his grave. Such were the dazzling tints, when first they threw Enchantment on the yet uncheated eye, Feeding upon the beautiful and new With all the keen delight of ecstasy; But such they were not ever;—as the bow Grows fainter when the setting sun retires, And clouds and peaks no longer, in his fires, Lift round the burning west their magic show, Wherein the waving summit, crowned with gold, Seems like a flash suspended on its path, And festooned light around the tempest rolled, The smile of beauty on the brow of wrath,— These fade away when night assumes her reign, Or only sicken in her paler beams, That mark with silver lines the hill and plain, Along the still meandering of streams;— So life, when novelty has gone, and youth Flitted on silent wings of down away, When now the clear and steady torch of truth Shows it, a moment's pride, a long decay,— So life grows pale and cold, and chillness creeps Through the crushed heart, elate and full before; So glory on his broken falchion sleeps, Nor love can fire, nor beauty madden more. O, in that night of feeling, still one tone Comes through the silent watches low and sweet, And hours of happiness for ever flown Are thronging round, and youthful pulses beat; A fountain of deep love the heart uncloses, And all its purest tides are flowing o'er, And memory, from the cell where she reposes, Brings out her fairest and her choicest store. Fancied or real, still that voice is flinging Its sweetness on the desert winds, and all The seraph choirs of heaven are round me singing, So loud and clear the tones; and now they fall, And as they die in languishment away, Stealing to some far-distant world above, Methinks I hear a well-known accent say, “Follow me,—'t is the voice of her you love.” ? ??????. “Omnia mutantur, nihil interit.”— Ovid. The world is thrown around us as a veil, To dim the searching of the spirit's eye Through all the fair variety that lies, In undiscovered majesty, beyond The canopy of light and beauty, rolled, In pure and awful distance, o'er the throne On which the Universal Being dwells Alone amid his wonders. Time goes on In its eternal orbit, and compels, As with a boundless torrent, all that move Nearer its consummation. All things change; As in the tranquil mirror of a lake, When Day has closed his portals, and his light, Softly retiring, throws upon the cloud Its fairest glances, and in pictured pomp Unrolls a magic curtain round his seat Of glory on the mountain-tops, and bends An iris arch above him;—as that cloud Sailing before the ministers who bear The message of the Mighty One abroad O'er continent and ocean, with a voice Now melting in a whisper, and now loud As waves that meet around a mid-sea crag, And lash it in their fury,—as that cloud Floats o'er the clear, deep water, till the sky, That swells within its bosom, seems on fire With quickly-coming flashes of bright hues Born of the beam of ether, and unstained With aught of earthly tincture,—all below In the calm depths of purity, flit by Like doves along the north-wind, when they seek The softness and the sweetness, and the light And warmth of spring unfading, on the shores Where ever bloom the orange and the lime, And fruits are ever hanging wreathed in flowers, And glancing out intensely from the dark, Full-tufted verdure, whose unwasting shade Hath ever spread abroad a sacred gloom Above the temple of the sylvan powers. So all things change, and yet are all the same: And He, whose eye looks forth, and measures all, As we behold the full moon, when she hangs Mantled in palest tenderness, and weeps Tears on the sleeping landscape, till the hills And plains and meadows catch her tender light, And softly send it on the musing eye In infinite reflections,—when we dream Of oceans rolling on her spotted orb, And islands crowned in beauty, and of fires Lit on her volcan summits, till we trace, On a bright map, a world for spirits, where Live the light forms that fancy oft at night Sees floating on the moonbeams, or at sail High on the fleecy vapor, as it rolls Its foam above the mountains,—whence they come, As angels came on messages of peace, To whisper consolation, or convey The wishes of a pure and humble heart Unto the Universal ear, where all May speak, and feel a kind reply descend In words of gentleness, as evening dews Melt on the silent landscape, and it smiles:— So the All-seeing eye, whose viewless seat Is shrouded in infinitude, beyond The flaming walls that gird creation in,— So the All-seeing eye looks forth, and blends The world of suns and satellites, that sweep O'er the broad path of ages, in one orb Hung in the centre of immensity, And from the solemn void, wherein he dwells, Contemplates all existence, as a point Twinkling amid the glory that enshrouds His throne, as with a mantle of dim shade, And from the eye of sense conceals the flame From whose exhaustless fount all being rose. SONNETS. [I. Is it not true, as one has proudly sung] Is it not true, as one has proudly sung, “A Poet's love is Immortality?” Many a time and oft that note has rung Echoings of high and heavenly harmony. Sweet, when the weary day is done, to be Greeted by budding lips and kindling eyes, Pressed to the one true heart in ecstasy,— Enchantment only worthy of the skies. Repose my heart has sought, and all in vain; Care, like a demon, hunts me everywhere; In vain this faded brow a wreath may wear,— Vain laurels, colder than the captive's chain: A look, a word of fondness, kindly given, Love-lit and tender, to that fame were heaven. [II. O thou sole-sitting Spirit of Loneliness] O thou sole-sitting Spirit of Loneliness! Whose haunt is by the wild and dropping caves, Thou of the musing eye and scattered tress, I meet thee with a passionate joy, no less Than when the mariner, from off his waves, Catches the glimpses of a far blue shore,— He thinks the danger of his voyage o'er, And, pressing all his canvas, steers to land, With a glad bosom and a ready hand. So I would hie me to thy desolate shade, And seat myself in some deep-sheltered nook, And never breathe a wish again to look On the tossed world, but rather, listless laid, Pore on the bubbles of the passing brook.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. PROMETHEUS. ?? ?? ?????? ????????, ???? ?????? ??????, ???? ???? ??????? ?? ???? ?????????? ??????. Æsch. Prom. Desm. 320. PART I. I. They talk of love and pleasure,—but 'tis all A tale of falsehood. Life is made of gloom: The fairest scenes are clad in ruin's pall, The loveliest pathway leads but to the tomb; Alas! destruction is man's only doom. We rise, and sigh our little lives away, A moment blushes beauty's vernal bloom, A moment brightens manhood's summer ray, Then all is wrapt in cold and comfortless decay. II. And yet the busy insects sweat and toil, And struggle hard to heap the shining ore: How trifling seems their bustle and turmoil, And even how trifling seems the sage's lore! Even he who, buried in the classic store Of ancient ages, ponders o'er the page Of Tully or of Plato, does no more Than with his bosom's quiet warfare wage, And in an endless round of useless thought engage. III. Then close thy ponderous folio, and retire To shady coverts, undisturbed retreats, And lay thy careless hand upon thy lyre, And call the Muses from their woodland seats: But ah! the poet's pulse how vainly beats! 'Tis but vexation to attune his strings. Even he who with the Chian bard competes Had better close his fancy's soaring wings, And own earth's highest bliss no true enjoyment brings. IV. We find this earth a gloomy, dull abode, And yet we wish for pleasure;—sense is keen, And so this life is but a toilsome road, That leads us to a more delightful scene. Well, if thou find'st a solace there, I ween It is the only joy thou e'er canst know; And yet it is but fancy, never seen By mortal eye was all that lovely show, That paradise where we so fondly wish to go. V. We have a body,—and the wintry wind Will not respect the poet. No, the storm Beats heavy on the case that holds a mind Of heavenly mould, as on the vulgar form; When bleak winds blow, how can the soul be warm? Can fancy brighten in the cell of care? Can inspiration's breath the soul inform, When the limbs shiver in the gusty air, And in the thin, pale face the fiends of hunger stare? VI. O, they may tell me of the ethereal flame That burns and burns for ever;—'t is the dream Of those high intellects, who well may claim Relation to the pure, celestial beam: The life eternal,—'t is a glorious theme, Whereon bards, sages, have outpoured their fire; Yet view it narrowly, and it will seem But the wild mounting of unquenched desire, The long extended wish to raise our being higher. VII. True, 't is a mighty stretch, when unconfined The soul expatiates in imagined being, And where the vulgar eye can only find Dust, by a second sight strange visions seeing, And still from wonder on to wonder fleeing, By its enkindled feelings wildly driven, It leaps the walls of earth, but ill agreeing With those high-mounting thoughts to genius given, Nor rests till it has set its eagle-foot in heaven. VIII. And there it culls the choicest fields of earth For all the pure and beautiful and bright, And gives a gay and odorous Eden birth, And rains around a flood of golden light, Where sun, moon, stars, no more awake the sight, But, pouring from the Eternal's viewless throne, It fills us with ineffable delight, And, every stain of earth for ever flown, We bathe and bask in this ethereal fount alone. IX. And flowers of every hue and scent are there; The laughing fields are one enamelled bed, And filled with sweetness breathes the fanning air, And soaring birds are singing overhead, And bubbling brooks, by living fountains fed, O'er pebbled gems and pearl-sands winding play; One boundless beauty o'er creation shed, The storm, the cloud, the mist, have hied away, And nothing dims the blaze of this immortal day. X. And man, a pure and quenchless beam of light, All eye, all ear, all feeling, reason, soul, He takes from good to good his tireless flight, And, ever aiming at perfection's goal, Sees at one instant-glance the moral whole; Powers ever kindling, always on the wing, The disembodied spark Prometheus stole, To science, virtue, love, devotion, spring His fancy, reason, heart,—creation's angel king. XI. The whole machine of worlds before his eye Unfolded as a map, he glances through Systems in moments, sees the comet fly In its clear orbit through the fields of blue, And every instant gives him something new, Whereon his ever-quenchless thirst he feeds; From star to insect, sun to falling dew, From atom to the immortal mind, he speeds, And in the glow of thought the boundless volume reads. XII. Truth stands before him in a full, clear blaze, An intellectual sunbeam, and his eye Can look upon it with unbending gaze, And its minutest lineaments descry; No speck nor line is passed unnoticed by, And the bright form perfection's image wears. And on its forehead sceptred majesty The calm, but awful port of justice bears, Who weeps when she condemns, but smiles not when she spares. XIII. Mercy! thou dearest attribute of Heaven, The attractive charm, the smile of Deity, To whom the keys of Paradise are given,— Thy glance is love, thy brow benignity, And bending o'er the world with tender eye, Thy bright tears fall upon our hearts like dew, And, melting at the call of clemency, We raise to God again our earth-fixed view, And in our bosom glows the living fire anew. XIV. The perfect sense of beauty,—how the heart, Even in this low estate, with transport swells, When Nature's charms at once upon us start! The ocean's roaring waste, where grandeur dwells, The cloud-girt mountain, whose bald summit tells, Beneath a pure black sky the faintest star, The flowery maze of woods, and hills, and dells, The bubbling brook, the cascade sounding far, Robed in a mellow mist, as Evening mounts her car, XV. And with her glowing pencil paints the skies In hues, transparent, melting, deep, and clear, The richest picture shown to mortal eyes, And lovelier when a dearer self is near, And we can whisper in her bending ear, “How fair are these, and yet how fairer thou!” And, pleased the artless flattery to hear, Her full blue eyes in meek confusion bow,— That hour, that look, that eye, are living to me now. XVI. But there the cloud of earth-born passion gone, Taste, quick, correct, exalted, raised, refined, Rears o'er the subject intellect her throne, The pure Platonic ecstasy of mind; By universal harmony defined, It feels the fitness of each tint and hue, Of every tone that breathes along the wind, Of every motion, form, that charm the view, And lives upon the grand, the beautiful, and new. XVII. The feelings of the heart retain their sway, But are ennobled;—not the instinctive tie, The storgè, that so often leads astray, And poisons all the springs of infancy, So that thenceforth to live is but to die, And linger with a venom at the heart, To feel the sinking of despondency, To writhe around the early-planted dart, And burn and pant with thirst that never can depart. XVIII. Such are the wounds indulgent parents give, Who slay the smiling blossom of their love; And if the blighted plant should lingering live, The spirit cannot wing its flight above, But in its restless agony will rove Still on and onward in forbidden joy, Till wildly, as a whirlwind's fury drove, He rushes to the foes that soon destroy, And then they weep, and curse their lost, deluded boy. XIX. His friendship warmed to love, all things, that feel, In all his tenderness of feeling share; His love, bright as devotion's holiest zeal, For sex, without its ill, has being there; All pleasure's smile and virtue's beauty wear, And kindred souls in dear communion blend, Love, purest love, without its sigh and care, And hand in hand their mounting way they wend, With hope that meets no chill, and joys that never end. XX. Devotion,—'tis an all-absorbing flame,— The omnipotent, all-perfect, endless Being, The Builder of the universal frame, At one quick glance past, present, future, seeing, By whom, hot, cold, moist, dry, good, ill, agreeing, At last, the perfect birth of bliss comes forth, And evil to its native darkness fleeing, Virtue shines out in her unspotted worth, And blasts to meanest dust the proudest forms of earth. XXI. Hark! hear the holy choir around the throne; Their lips are coals, their pæans vocal fire; They sing the Eternal Lord, who sits alone, And still their swelling anthem rises higher, The warbling of the universal lyre, The harmony of hearts and souls and spheres. O, how my bosom burns with long desire, How flow my bitter, penitential tears! O, 'tis a strain too loud and sweet for mortal ears! XXII. But stop, delirious fancy! now awaking From thy enchanted dream, what meets thy sight? The charmed spell, that bound thy senses, breaking, Thy Eden withers in a simoom's blight, And all its suns have set in endless night; Love, sanctity, and glory, all a gleam, Thy airy paradise has vanished quite, And, falling, fading, flickering, dies life's beam, Thy visioned heaven has fled. Alas! 't was but a dream! XXIII. O for those early days, when patriarchs dwelt In pastoral tents, that rose beneath the palm, When life was pure, and every bosom felt Unwarped affection's sweetest, holiest balm, And like the silent scene around them, calm, Years stole along in one unruffled flow! Their hearts aye warbled with devotion's psalm, And as they saw their buds around them blow, Their keenly glistening eye revealed the grateful glow. XXIV. They sat at evening, when their gathered flocks Bleated and sported by the palm-crowned well, The sun was glittering on the pointed rocks, And long and wide the deepening shadows fell; They sang their hymn, and in a choral swell They raised their simple voices to the Power Who smiled along the fair sky; they would dwell Fondly and deeply on his praise; that hour Was to them as to flowers that droop and fade the shower. XXV. He warmed them in the sunbeams, and they gazed In wonder on that kindling fount of light, And as, hung in the glowing west, it blazed In brighter glories, with a full delight They poured their pealing anthem, and when night Lifted her silver forehead, and the moon Rolled through the blue serenity, in bright But softer radiance, they blessed the boon That gave those hours the charm without the fire of noon. XXVI. Spring of the living world, the dawn of nature, When man walked forth the lord of all below, Erect and godlike in his giant stature, Before the tainted gales of vice 'gan blow; His conscience spotless as the new-fallen snow, Pure as the crystal spouting from the spring, He aimed no murderous dagger, drew no bow, But at the soaring of the eagle's wing, The gaunt wolf's stealthy step, the lion's ravening spring. XXVII. With brutes alone he armed himself for war; Free to the winds his long locks dancing flew, And at his prowling enemy afar He shot his death-shaft from the nervy yew; In morning's mist his shrill-voiced bugle blew, And with the rising sun on tall rocks strode, And bounding thro' the gemmed and sparkling dew, The rose of health, that in his full cheek glowed, Told of the pure, fresh stream that there enkindling flowed. XXVIII. This was the age when mind was all on fire, The day of inspiration, when the soul, Warmed, heightened, lifted, burning with desire For all the great and lovely, to the goal Of man's essential glory rushed; then stole The sage his spark from heaven, the prophet spake His deep-toned words of thunder, as when roll The peals amid the clouds,—words that would break The spirit's leaden sleep, and all its terrors wake. XXIX. He stood on Sinai, wrapped in storm-clouds, wild His loose locks streamed around him, and his eye Flashed indignation on a world defiled With sense and slavery, who lost the high Prerogative of power and spirit by Their longings for their flesh-pots:—O, 't is lust Which robs us of our freedom, makes us lie Wallowing in willing wretchedness, nor burst That thraldom of our woes, most foul, most hard, most curst. XXX. He saw those Samsons by a harlot shorn, He saw them take the distaff, and assume The soft and tawdry tunics which adorn The leering siren; all their flush and bloom, And might and vigor, all that can illume And blazon manhood, by the magic rod Of pleasure changed to weakness, squalor, gloom, And they, who erst with port majestic trod, Then drunk and gorged and numbed, in sleep lethargic nod. XXXI. He stood and raised his mighty voice in wrath, And sent it, like a whirlwind, o'er those ears, And thrilled them, like a simoom on its path Of havoc. See, the slumbering giant hears, And, waked and roused and kindled by his fears, Starts into new life with an instant spring; This is no time for soft, repentant tears; At once away their wine-drenched spoils they fling, Their energy is up, their souls are on the wing. XXXII. They did not lie, and wish, and long to break The manacles which clasped them; they did tear Cables as we would silk-threads, and did take An upward journey, where the world shines fair, The temple of true virtue, glory, where Man lives and glows in sunshine, where the prize, More rich than laurel wreaths, for all who dare To reason's perfect, fearless freedom rise, Sends forth bright beams, that dim and blind all meaner eyes. XXXIII. Go o'er the fields of Greece, and see her towers Fallen and torn and crumbled,—see her fanes Prostrate and weed-encircled; dimly lowers Brute ignorance around them, slavery reigns And lords it o'er their sacred cities, chains Are riveted upon them, and they gall Their cramped limbs to the bone, the lashed wretch strains To rend the gnawing iron,—but his fall Is in himself. Sleep on! ye well deserve your thrall. XXXIV. This is the old age of our fallen race; We mince in steps correct, but feeble; creep By rule unwavering in a tortoise pace; We do not, like the new-born ancient, leap At once o'er mind's old barriers, but we keep Drilling and shaving down the wall; we play With stones and shells and flowers, and as we peep In nature's outward folds, like infants, say, How bright and clear and pure our intellectual day. XXXV. We let gorged despots rise and plant their foot Upon our prostrate necks, if they but give Their golden counters. Tyranny takes root In a rich soil of sloth and self;—we live Like oysters in their closed shells;—can we strive For freedom when this cobweb circle draws Its tangling coils around us? Let us give Our hearts to Nature and her sacred laws, And we can fight unharmed, unchecked in freedom's cause. XXXVI. There are a few grand spirits who can feel The beauty of simplicity, and pour Their ardent wishes forth, and sternly deal Their crumbling blows around them; they would soar, Where man unfettered rises, proudly o'er The common herd of slaves to power and rule: Go, search the world, you cannot find a more Weak, drivelling subject for a despot's tool, Than him who dares not leave the lessons of his school. XXXVII. Cast back your sickened eye upon the dawn Of Greek and Roman freedom. See their sons Before the bulwark of their dear rights drawn, Proud in their simple dignity, as runs The courser to the fair stream;—on their thrones They sat, all kings, all people;—they were free, For they were strong and temperate, and in tones Deep and canorous, nature's melody, They sung in one full voice the hymn of liberty. XXXVIII. In Dorian mood they marched to meet their foes; With measured step their awful front they bore, As, when a mountain billow slowly flows, Rising and heaving onward to the shore, It rolls its mingled waters with a roar, That echoes through the mountains; wide they dash, Blue as the heavens they kiss, and, tumbling o'er, They burst upon the coast, and foaming lash The rocks and splintered cliffs; earth groans beneath the crash. XXXIX. Then liberty and law were brightest: men Were not themselves,—the city was their soul; They did not keep their treasures in a den, And brood them, as a fowl her eggs,—the pole To which their hearts were pointed, and the goal Of all their strivings, was the public good; The sage, with naked brow, and flowing stole, And snowy beard, and eye majestic, stood, And gave to willing minds their high but simple food. XL. It was not cates which pleased then, but they drew And filled their brimming goblet from the stream, And plucked the fruits that overhung it; few But noble were their works,—the living beam Of sunlight stamped their pages. We may dream Of monsters, till the brain is mad,—the pure, Bright images, wherewith their volumes teem, The taste of nature always will allure, And while man reads and thinks, and feels and loves, endure. XLI. Then Wisdom crowned her head with stars, and smiled In Socrates, and glowed in Plato, shone Like day's god in the Stagirite, who piled A pyramid of high thoughts; as a throne, It lorded o'er the world for ages; grown Weak in a second childhood, they did count And nicely measure each minutest stone, And crawled around the base, but could not mount And taste, upon the top, the pure ethereal fount. XLII. Then Eloquence was power,—it was the burst Of feeling, clothed in words o'erwhelming, poured From mind's long-cherished treasury, and nurst By virtue into majesty; it soared And thundered in Pericles; and was stored With fire that flashed and kindled in that soul Who called, when Philip, with barbarian horde, Hung over Athens, and prepared to roll His deluge on her towers, and drown her freedom's whole. XLIII. Then Poetry was inspiration,—loud, And sweet, and rich, in speaking tones it rung, As if a choir of muses from a cloud, Sun-kindled, on the bright horizon hung; Their voices harmonized, their lyres full strung, Rolled a deep descant o'er a listening world. There was a force, a majesty, when sung The bard of Troy,—his living thoughts were hurled, Like lightnings, when the folds of tempests are unfurled. XLIV. Was it the tumult of contending powers, The clash of swords and shields, the rush of cars, Or when aloft, in night's serenest hours, The moon, encircled by her train of stars, Poured her soft light around, and dewy airs Breathed through the camp and cooled the warrior's brow,— Was it the mellow slumber which repairs The languid limbs, or keen-edged words, that bow The soul in wondering awe,—or was it, round the prow, XLV. The purple wave disparting, and in foam Roaring behind the vessel, as she flew, A white-winged falcon, from her lessening home, Ploughing the sea's broad back, as loudly blew The winds among the cordage,—Nature threw Her energy athwart his page, and shed Her blaze upon his mind, and there we view, If, chance, by taste, unwarped, unfettered, led, A new-made world, all life and light, around us spread. XLVI. The times are altered:—man is now no more The being of his capabilities; The days of all his energy are o'er. And will those fallen demigods arise In all their panoply, and hear the cries Of king-crushed myriads, who wear the chain Of bondage? will light dawn upon their eyes, And wake them from their iron sleep, again To bare their breast in strife on freedom's holy plain? XLVII. A trumpet echoes o'er their tombs,—awake! The long full peal is “Vengeance!—sleep no more!” The marble walls, as by an earthquake, break, And, lo! an armed legion onward pour Bright casques and nodding plumes, and thirsting gore, The blood of awe-struck tyrants, flash their swords; Their march is as a torrent river's roar, And, with a waked slave's desperation, towards Their homes of icy gloom they drive Sarmatia's hordes. XLVIII. There is a flood of light rolled round the hill Of Jove, and from its cloudy brightness spring Spectres of long-departed greatness; still Their heart-felt homage to that shrine they bring, Which time has made all sacred, where the king Of thunder sat upon his ivory throne, And by him stood his bird, with ready wing To pounce upon his foes. The days are flown When darkness ruled as God,—Valor will claim his own, XLIX. And Rome again is free, and from thy shore, Italia! Gaul and Goth and Hun shall fly; Thy sons shall wash away their shame in gore, And once again the year of liberty, The mighty months of glory, they shall see, Along thy radiant zodiac, on the path Of ages, warn the nations, “We are free!” O, who can tell the madness and the wrath, The drunkenness of soul, a new-waked people hath? L. They stand for hearth and altar, wife and sire; Their lisping infants call them to the fight, And as they call, their eyeballs flashing fire, And shouting with a courser's wild delight, When loosed he bounds and prances in the might Of young life. There is in the sound of home A magic, and the patriot, in his right Strong-founded, meets the prowling foes that come To waste his land,—no threats his valor can benumb. LI. The torch that lights him in his high career Was kindled at the purest, holiest flame; He fights for all his bosom holds most dear, And oh! no voice so conquering as the claim Of filial tenderness and love; no name So melting as sire, wife, and children,—all Are in those sweet words blended. What is fame, Though pealing with her trumpet to the call Of kindred, bound and toiling in a tyrant's thrall? LII. He sees the noble and the learned stoop, And kiss the feet that crush them, and the crowd, In hopeless, cureless, willing bondage droop; And yet he does not shrink beneath that cloud, But, muttering execrations deep, not loud, He whets his sword upon his heaped-up wrong; And starting, like a spectre from his shroud, Stung by the lash of slavery's knotted thong, In all the might of wrath, he hurls his strength along. LIII. Even as a tigress, when her secret lair The hunter hath invaded,—how she draws Her limbs to all their tenseness, points her hair, Gnashes her grinding teeth, and bares her claws, And breathes a stifled growl, and in a pause Of burning fury hangs upon the spring, And, nerved and heated in a parent's cause, Bounds roaring on the robber, like the wing Of pouncing hawk, or stone hurled whizzing from the sling! LIV. They meet at Tivoli,—and night has spread Her curtain o'er those legions, who would quench The flame that Brutus, Tully, Cato, fed, And from its lofty column madly wrench The new-raised statue. Freemen will not blench, When they have broke their fetters; but will arm Their nervy hands with vengeance, and will clench And grapple with their masters; for the charm Of liberty's sweet voice the coldest heart will warm. LV. They meet, and they are victors;—but the soul, Like his own mountain's lava glowing, dies, And falls with hand firm-grasped upon the goal Of all his longings. As he mounts the skies, He drops his mantle on the youth, who rise To give their lives, like him, to liberty; Devoted to the noblest sacrifice, Like stars of purest brightness, they shall be The rallying-point where all the bruised and crushed shall flee. LVI. A dream,—a cruel dream! Fair rose the sun Of freedom on that sky without a cloud; Sweet was the dawn, when liberty was won By hands unweaponed; and they hasted, proud Of bloodless conquest, in their pæans loud To those who Samson-like had rent their chain; Then heavenward shone the foreheads which had bowed To foreign rule for ages, and again The people's majesty towered over hill and plain. LVII. And we did hope the Roman had awaked, And ancient valor had revived anew, And that the eagle's thirst of light unslaked, As when above the Capitol she flew, Still sought her eyry in the boundless blue; And we did hope a spirit had gone forth, Which tyrants and their parasites would rue, And, like a torrent rolling to the north, Would with it blend all hearts that kept man's native worth. LVIII. It seemed the renovation of the world, The knell of despots, and the day when thrones Were tottering, and crowns falling, when kings, hurled From their base height of lust, should leave their bones To moulder in their feudal filth; the stones Which bound the arch of empire lost their hold, And in the sudden crush were heard the groans Of gorged and pampered spoilers, who had rolled Like havoc on the dumb, weak tremblers of their fold. LIX. And we did see a nation on their way To stop the invading torrent, ere it came And deluged their fair fields. It was a day Of breathless expectation, when the flame Of freedom burned the highest, for the game Of man's emancipation was at stake. The heart that would not throb then, had no claim And place in Honor's column,—'t would not wake Even if a bolt from Heaven should by its pillow break. LX. They hung upon the mountains, like a storm Crowning the Apennine with deep, dun shade, And o'er them towered the bold and ardent form, Who seemed in panoply of fire arrayed; And from their pikes and bayonets there played A stream of lightnings on the advancing host, Which, trained and nurtured in the murdering trade, Like tempest-billows rolling to the coast, Marched slow and still and sure, to storm that rocky post. LXI. In all the discipline of war they came; Their strong, squared columns moved with heavy tread, Their step, their bearing, even their breath the same, And not a murmur whispered through the dead And boding silence; by a master led, Even as a rock, that fronts the infuriate wave, They saw them hanging on their mountain's head; With cold, proud sneer they marked the untutored brave, And knew here lay wide-yawned Italian freedom's grave. LXII. Secure and calm, they pitched their camp, and piled Their arms, and furled their banners; all was still, When, like the bursting of a hail-cloud, wild Those sun-fired legions hurried down the hill, And dashed against their robbers, with a will To do all deeds of daring, and a might Nerved into madness by those wrongs, that fill The heart to overflowing; from that height, In one wild rush, they poured their souls into the fight. LXIII. Awhile the Austrian wavered, for the blows Fell with a giant's vigor; but the clear, Quick-sighted leader bade their stretched wings close, And circle in the headlong swarms; then fear Usurped the seat of courage; far and near The plain was covered with the flying bands. In vain the patriot's effort, word, and tear, His life's blood only drenched his country's sands, Or stained with fruitless drops the brute invader's hands. LXIV. The invading wave rolls on,—no arm is raised To stem its ceaseless progress; in its flood It swallows all the hopes, on which men gazed With such deep yearnings, as when linnets brood Their callow nestlings,—they are now the food Of sceptred ribaldry and regal sneers. Well, let them laugh and revel in light mood,— A voice of wrath, erelong, will thrill their ears, And give them doubly full their cup of blood and tears. LXV. Fosterers of nations! whose parental hand Scourges the unwilling subject to obey, To you, ye self-misnomered holy band, The goaded slaves their stripes and wounds shall pay; Though now their heads in childlike fear they lay, They keenly feel the smart of all their wrong; They now may stoop and crawl, there is a day When they will rise and to their vengeance throng; Even now, ye trembling dread what will not linger long. LXVI. Aceldema of nations! thou hast bled From countless gashes,—thou must still bleed on; Thy children's gore that harvest-field has fed, Where thou thy chains and manacles hast won; Thy struggle for true liberty is done, France, Italy, have roused and burst their thrall, And started in that glorious race to run. Where have their high words ended? See their fall. The despots crush them now, and say, “So perish all LXVII. Who will not sleep contented, while we rule And fleece and flay them.” You may writhe and turn, And curse them, as you crouch, their earth-pressed stool; Yes, ye may start a moment, spring and spurn The foot that treads you; ye may glow and burn With wrath to be so scoffed at, but a weight Like mountains bows you down; dust is your urn; The spirit is besotted:—this your fate, To rise and stumble, kneel and kiss the hand you hate. LXVIII. One storm has come and gone;—the film is torn From off your eyes;—you look, and Power is there; Around his throne unnumbered shields are borne, Serried in close array; you cannot tear The monster from his pinnacle; his lair Is filled with bones of freemen he has slain. As a crouched lion, when his fangs are bare, He casts around his keen eye; Hope in vain Lifts up her gaze, his glance bends it to earth again. LXIX. Freedom can have no dwelling on that shore; She must away and cross the Atlantic flood. Why play the rude game over? you may pour In waves, like torrent rivers, your best blood, But it will end in “We have dared and stood In battle for our rights; we sink again Before an overwhelming weight, the food Of tyrants and their parasites, who drain Our tears like wine, and bind with doubled links our chain.” LXX. Severe and simple walked the Cyprian sage In Athens' pictured porch; he showed and taught Unbending virtue in a downward age, And reckoned all the joys of sense as naught, And mastered down the tide of swelling thought, And bound on passion an unyielding rein; With slow, sure step, the highest good he sought, And shunning, as a viper's tooth, the stain Of weakness, marched erect to Truth's majestic fane, LXXI. Which stood aloft in Doric plainness; bright The sunbeams played upon its marble pride, And from it flashed a stream of purest light Down its ascending path,—as rolls the tide Of snow-fed torrents, in a deep, a wide, Resistless rush of waters, till the plain Is satiate with its richness, then they glide In summer's scanty wave, so pure, no stain Darkens its liquid light, when rolling to the main. LXXII. So on the mind enwrapped in error's cloak, Whom bigotry and sense have led astray, If chance the fetters of his thought are broke, And all the night that dimmed him swept away, And on him Wisdom pours her fullest ray, A flood seems rolled through his exulting soul, And all its fulness hardly can allay His new-waked thirst for knowledge; to the goal Of truth he springs, and spurns indignant all control. LXXIII. Awhile he grasps at Science, with the strong, Fierce spirit of ambition, when his car O'er fortune's field of blood is borne along, Drawn by the wildly-rushing steeds of war, And hurrying on in quest of Fame's bright star, That shines through smoke and dust and wounds and gore; Justice and mercy cannot raise a bar Across the torrent of his wrath; its roar Drives virtue, love, and peace, affrighted from its shore. LXXIV. So on he rushes, in the high pursuit Of knowledge, till his stored and wearied mind Bows 'neath the weight of its collected fruit, And, casting all its useless load behind, No more to man's essential being blind, His thought dwells only on the good supreme; Then, calm in dignity, in taste refined, A spirit pure and lucid as the beam Ethereal, virtue's charms are his continual theme. LXXV. And what is virtue but the just employ Of all our faculties, so that we live Longest and soundest and serenest,—joy Its handmaid, all the sweets that health can give, The light heart, and the strong frame, which can strive, Delighted in the war we must endure; Thoughts clear, bold, tireless, feelings all alive, No passion can subdue, no sense allure, Even as our Sire in heaven, just, merciful, and pure. LXXVI. The animal is crushed, the god bears sway, The immortal essence, the enkindling fire; What powers, what energy, it can display, When, freed from life's gross wants, it dare aspire, And give a free reign to its high desire, And longing for a mind that cannot sleep, Even as Apollo with his golden lyre, And canopied in sunbeams, he would sweep His chords, and pour a hymn, harmonious, full, and deep. LXXVII. A hymn to Nature, and the unseen hand That guides its living wheels, the moving soul Of this material universe, who spanned Within his grasp its circle, where suns roll, Each in its fixed orb, and around the whole Has drawn in viewless light its flaming walls; This is the limit of our thought, the goal Where mind's imaginative pinion falls, When, wrapt in solemn thought, no link of earth inthralls. LXXVIII. I walk abroad at midnight, and my eye, Purged from its sensual blindness, upward turns, And wanders o'er the dark and spangled sky, Where every star, a fount of being, burns, And pours out life, as Naiads from their urns Drop their refreshing dew on herbs and flowers;— I gaze, until my fancy's eye discerns, As in an azure hall, the assembled powers Of nature spend in deep consult those solemn hours. LXXIX. Methinks I hear their language;—but it sounds Too high for my conception, as the roar Of thunder in the mountains, when it bounds From peak to peak; or on the echoing shore The tempest-driven billows bursting pour, And raise their awful voices; or the groan Rumbling in Ætna's entrails, ere its store Of lava spouts its red jets; or the moan Of winds, that war within their caverned walls of stone. LXXX. And there is melody among those spheres, A music sweeter than the vernal train, Or fay notes, which the nymph-struck shepherd hears. Where moonlight dances on the liquid plain, That curls before the west-wind, till the main Seems waving like a ruffled sheet of fire:— 'T is Nature's Alleluia; and again The stars exult, as when the Eternal Sire Said, “Be there light,” and light shone forth at his desire. LXXXI. How my heart trembles on so vast a theme!— The boundless source of energy and power, The living essence of the good supreme, The all-seeing eye that watches every hour, That marks the opening of each bud and flower, That paints the colors of the ephemeron's wing, That counts the myriad drops which form the shower, As wondrous, in the awakening call of spring, As worlds that lie beyond the stretch of fancy's wing. LXXXII. With brute, unconscious gaze, man marks the earth Take on its livery of early flowers; He sees no beauty in this annual birth, No ceaseless working of creative powers; His soul, lethargic, wakes not in those hours When air is living, and the waters teem With new-born being, and the mantling bowers Are full of love and melody, and seem The happy Eden of a poet's raptured dream. LXXXIII. The sky is then serenest, and its arch Of brighter sapphire; and the sportive train Of life-awakening zephyrs, on their march, Shed renovating influence o'er the plain; The blue waves sparkle on the laughing main, Which renders back to heaven its placid smile; The checkered sky, now clear, now dropping rain On flowers, that spread their leaves to catch it, while The full-swoln river rolls a fertilizing Nile. LXXXIV. How lovely is the landscape! Morning peeps Behind yon leafy mountain, and her eye Looks o'er a fresh, green world, that calmly sleeps In the sweet cradle of its infancy, And, clustering round the rocky summits, fly Light mists, now painted in the rich array Of Heaven's majestic spectrum, which on high Spans the dark tempest, as it steals away, And westward glows in pomp the golden eye of day. LXXXV. Beneath the cliff that frowns in blackness lies The mirror of dark waters, on it rest Soft wreaths of snowy vapor, such as rise Spotless in winter on the mountain's breast, Soft as the downy couch by beauty prest, And mantled in as gay a canopy Of overhanging clouds in crimson drest, All glow, transparency, and purity, Fit curtain to the throne where dwells Eternity. LXXXVI. And now the sun springs upward from his bed, Insufferably brilliant, and his blaze Tinges with flowing gold the icy head Of peaks which rise above the clouds, and gaze In lonely grandeur on an endless maze Of budding landscape, hills, woods, meadows, lakes, Rivers, and winding rivulets, where plays The wave in lines of silver. Day now breaks In dazzling floods of light, and living Nature wakes LXXXVII. Her woodland choristers, and air is breathing In tones of love-tuned harmony, the deep, Heart-kindling, soul-inspiring anthem wreathing The burst of native joy that will not sleep, But at the summons of the dawn will leap, And all its full-swoln tides of feeling pour, And, as the light winds from the bright lake sweep The mantling vapors, it will freely soar, And with its strong voice drown the waterfall's wide roar. LXXXVIII. Let man come forth, and in the general throng Of tuneful hearts his high devotion raise, And, joining in the universal song Of thankful rapture, centre all the rays Of that heaven-lighted intellect, whose blaze, Bright emanation from the ethereal beam, For ever kindling through eternal days, A disembodied spark, along life's stream, Shall always hasten on to excellence supreme. LXXXIX. There is its only resting-place,—while here We pine in heart-sick longing. Is the fire That burns within our bosoms, for a sphere Of brighter, purer being, something higher Than all man ever reached to, the desire Of sinless purity and tireless thought, But the vibration of a living wire, The motion of frail flesh more nicely wrought, That trembles here awhile, and then consumes to naught? XC. Our thoughts are boundless, tho' our frames are frail, Our souls immortal, though our limbs decay; Though darkened in this poor life by a veil Of suffering, dying matter, we shall play In truth's eternal sunbeams; on the way To Heaven's high capitol our car shall roll; The temple of the Power whom all obey, That is the mark we tend to, for the soul Can take no lower flight, and seek no meaner goal. XCI. I feel it,—though the flesh is weak, I feel The spirit has its energies untamed By all its fatal wanderings; time may heal The wounds which it has suffered; folly claimed Too large a portion of its youth; ashamed Of those low pleasures, it would leap and fly, And soar on wings of lightning, like the famed Elijah, when the chariot rushing by Bore him with steeds of fire triumphant to the sky. XCII. We are as barks afloat upon the sea, Helmless and oarless, when the light has fled, The spirit, whose strong influence can free The drowsy soul, that slumbers in the dead, Cold night of moral darkness; from the bed Of sloth he rouses at her sacred call, And, kindling in the blaze around him shed, Rends with strong effort sin's debasing thrall, And gives to God his strength, his heart, his mind, his all. XCIII. Our home is not on earth; although we sleep, And sink in seeming death awhile, yet then The awakening voice speaks loudly, and we leap To life and energy and light again; We cannot slumber always in the den Of sense and selfishness; the day will break, Ere we for ever leave the haunts of men; Even at the parting hour the soul will wake, Nor like a senseless brute its unknown journey take. XCIV. How awful is that hour, when conscience stings The hoary wretch, who on his death-bed hears, Deep in his soul, the thundering voice that rings, In one dark, damning moment, crimes of years, And, screaming like a vulture in his ears, Tells one by one his thoughts and deeds of shame! How wild the fury of his soul careers! His swart eye flashes with intensest flame, And like the torture's rack the wrestling of his frame. XCV. Our souls have wings; their flight is like the rush Of whirlwinds, and they upward point their way, Like him who bears the thunder, when the flush Of his keen eye feeds on the dazzling ray: He claps his pinions in the blaze of day, And, gaining on the loftiest arch his throne, Darts his quick vision on his fated prey, And, gathering all his vigor, he is gone, And in an instant grasps his victim as his own. XCVI. We soar as proudly, and as quickly fall, This moment in the empyrean, then we sink, And, wrapping in the joys of sense our all, The stream that flows from Heaven we cannot drink, But we will lie along the flowery brink Of pleasure's tempting current, till the wave Is bitter and its banks bare, then we think Of what we might have been, and, idly brave, We take a short, weak flight, and drop into the grave. XCVII. My heart has felt new vigor, and the glow Of high hopes and bright fancy, and the spring Of that unchanging being, whither flow The breathings of our spirit, when its wing Is spread to take its last flight, where we cling In all the storms of life, as to an oar; There, like the shining serpent, we shall fling Away our earthly shackles; there no more The wind shall lift the waves and send them to the shore, XCVIII. To make wild music on the surging beach, And fling the foam aloft in snowy curls, And, pouring headlong through the sea-wall's breach, Suck, in the raging vortex' giddy whirls, The sea-bird lighting on the wave, that hurls To swift destruction; but there is a rock, Built strong, deep-planted,—Mercy there unfurls Her white flag, and the bark that stands the shock, The tempest-tossing tide, the breaker's burst, shall mock. XCIX. Much study is a weariness:—so said The sage of sages, and the aching eye, The pallid cheek, the trembling frame, the head Throbbing with thought and torn with agony, Attest his truth; and yet we will obey The intellectual Numen, and will gaze In wondering awe upon it, and will pay Worship to its omnipotence; the blaze Of mind is as a fount of fire, that upward plays C. Aloft on snow-clad mountains, on whose breast Unspotted purity has ever lain; The clouds of sense and passion cannot rest Upon its shadowy summit, nor can stain The white veil which enwraps it, nor in vain Roll the white floods of liquid heat; they melt The gathered stores of ages, to the plain They pour them down in streams enkindling, felt By every human heart, in myriad channels dealt. CI. This is the electric spark sent down from Heaven, That woke to second life the man of clay; The torch was lit in ether, light was given, Which not all passion's storms can sweep away. There is no closing to this once-risen day; Tempests may darken, but the sun will glow, Serene, unclouded, dazzling, and its ray Through some small crevices will always flow, Nor leave in utter night the world that gropes below. CII. And now and then some spirit from the throng, With wings Dædalean, in his rage will soar, And spreading wide his pinions, with a strong And desperate effort, from this servile shore Mounting like Minder's swans, whose voices pour Melodious music, like the dying fall Of zephyrs in a pine grove, or the roar Heard through the lonely forest when the pall Of night o'erhangs us, borne from some far waterfall. CIII. With wing as tireless, and with voice as sweet, His eye the falcon's, and his heart the dove's, He lifts his heavenward daring, till the heat Of that same orb he aimed to, which he loves To mark with keen eye till the cloud removes That gave its glow a softness, with its blight Withers his sinewy strength: so Heaven reproves The minds that scan it with audacious sight, And seek with restless gaze too pure, unmingled light. CIV. Gay was the paradise of love he drew, And pictured in his fancy; he did dwell Upon it till it had a life; he threw A tint of Heaven athwart it. Who can tell The yearnings of his heart, the charm, the spell, That bound him to that vision? Cold Truth came And plucked aside the veil,—he saw a hell, And o'er it curled blue flakes of lurid flame. He laid him down, and clasped his damp, chill brow in shame. CV. His fall is as the Titans', who would tear The thunder from their monarch, and would pile Their mountain stairway to Olympus, where The bolt they grasped at pierced them; with a smile Of fearless power the thunderer sat the while, And mocked their fruitless toiling, then he hurled His whitening arrows, and at once their guile And force were blasted, and their fall unfurled An awful warning flag to a presumptuous world. CVI. They stand, a beacon chained upon the rock; Heaven o'er them lifts unveiled her boundless blue; Ambition's sun still scorches, and the mock Of all their high desires is full in view; Affection cools their foreheads with no dew Of melting hearts, no rain of pitying eyes; The vulture, conscience, gnaws them; ever new Their heart's torn fibres into life will rise; The gorging fury clings, repelled she never flies. CVII. These are the men who dared to rend the veil Religion hung around us; they would tear The film from off our eyes, and break the pale That bound the awe-struck spirit, nor would spare The worship paid by ages; in the glare Of their red torches Piety grew blind, And saw no more her comforter; her fair And fond hopes lost their beauty. Can the mind When rifled of its faith, so dear a solace find? CVIII. They pull down Jove from his Idæan throne; They quench the Jew's Shechinah, and the cross, That bore the mangled corse of Heaven's own Son, They trample in the dust, and spurn as dross; And will they recompense the world its loss? Have they a fairer light to cheer our gloom? O, no!—the grave yawns on us as a fosse, Where we must sleep for ever; this our doom,— Body and mind shall rot and moulder in the tomb. CIX. There is a mourner, and her heart is broken. She is a widow; she is old and poor; Her only hope is in that sacred token Of peaceful happiness, when life is o'er; She asks nor wealth nor pleasure, begs no more Than Heaven's delightful volume, and the sight Of her Redeemer. Sceptics! would you pour Your blasting vials on her head, and blight Sharon's sweet rose, that blooms and charms her being's night? CX. She lives in her affections; for the grave Has closed upon her husband, children; all Her hopes are with the arm she trusts will save Her treasured jewels; though her views are small, Though she has never mounted high, to fall And writhe in her debasement, yet the spring Of her meek, tender feelings cannot pall Her unperverted palate, but will bring A joy without regret, a bliss that has no sting. CXI. Even as a fountain, whose unsullied wave Wells in the pathless valley, flowing o'er With silent waters, kissing, as they lave, The pebbles with light rippling, and the shore Of matted grass and flowers,—so softly pour The breathings of her bosom, when she prays, Low-bowed, before her Maker; then no more She muses on the griefs of former days; Her full heart melts and flows in Heaven's dissolving rays. CXII. And Faith can see a new world, and the eyes Of saints look pity on her; death will come; A few short moments over, and the prize Of peace eternal waits her, and the tomb Becomes her fondest pillow; all its gloom Is scattered. What a meeting there will be To her and all she loved here, and the bloom Of new life from those cheeks shall never flee! Theirs is the health which lasts through all eternity. CXIII. There is a war within me, and a strife Between my meaner and my nobler powers; I would, and yet I cannot, part with life: 'T is as a scorpion's sting to view those hours Where soul has bowed to sense, and darkly lowers The future in the distance. There are men, Whose strange-blent nature now an angel's towers, And rides among the loftiest, and then Seeks, like a snarling dog, the cynic's squalid den. CXIV. They nestle in their prison; they can find No friend to pour their hearts on; they would cling Closer than ivy to the kindred mind They touch. Its ice-cold freezes; then they fling Affection to the winds, and madly spring To shun their hated fellows in some cave; A leaden weight confines their spirit's wing, Life palls them, there is naught beyond the grave, They turn a sneer on Him who gives his hand to save. CXV. Theirs is the boundless love of sentient being;— As they have now the will, had they the power, Were but their longings and their strength agreeing, Their outspread hand a flood of bliss would shower, And wake the moral world, as in the hour Of spring wakes living nature;—from his sleep Of vice and superstition man should tower; Thoughts pure, high feelings, purpose strong and deep, Should lift him on, like wings, up virtue's craggy steep. CXVI. And flowers should bloom on his ascending track, Like roses on their wild thorns, by the way The hunter scales the mountains, nor should lack Music of tuneful birds; the flute should play The soft airs of the shepherdess; when day Spreads the broad plane-tree's noon shade, and when night Spangles her silent canopy, away By some dark cavern on the lonely height, The full-voiced hymn should tell the hermit's holy flight; CXVII. Who sits alone in darkness, wrapped in musing, Communing with the Universe, the Power, Whose ceaseless mercy, love and life diffusing, Bids the sun dart his warm rays, sends the shower, Mantles the turf in green, and decks the bower With tufted leaves and wreathed flowers, whose perfume, Earth's incense, breathes most sweetly at the hour When soft-descending night-dews steep the bloom, And with their star-lit gems the mantling arch illume; CXVIII. And from this waste of beauty fills the urn Of plenty with her fair fruits, spreads the plain With all the wealth of harvest, the return Of spring's delightful promise, with a chain Of love and bounty binding life's domain To Him who by his fiat gave it birth. Else had these flowery fields a desert lain, And all the riches of the teeming earth Been withered by the touch of endless, hopeless dearth; CXIX. Else had one wilderness of rock and sand, Treeless and herbless, where no rain nor dew Poured their reviving influence, one land Of sparkling barreness, appalled the view, And o'er it heaven had raised its cloudless blue, Hot as the burning steel's cerulean glow, And the sun's blasting arrows darted through The scorched brain, till its lava blood would flow In torrents, and its veins throb with delirious throe; CXX. And man had died of thirst and famine;—Death Comes not with direr aspect; eyes of blood, Staring and bursting; frequent, fiery breath Heaved from the breast, that seems one boiling flood Of maddening pulses, writhing as a brood Of serpents roused to fury; like their hiss They rush along the swoln veins, and for food His parched jaws gnaw his flesh, and oh! what bliss To drain his life's warm stream!—there is no death like this. CXXI. This is the living prototype of hell,— The earth all fire without, all flame within, And conscience barking like a Hyæn's yell, And pouring out her vialed wrath on sin; She lights her torch unwasting,—then begin Ages of endless torture, for the heart Whom Circe and the tempting Sirens win, While listening to their voice, must feel the smart And pangs of unfed Hope's forever probing dart. CXXII. The clouds are gathering on the mountain-tops, And in their dark veil wrap those cliffs and towers Of wasteless granite, those enduring props, On which the arch of heaven rests, where the powers Of winter hold their rule, even in the hours When sultry summer scorches; there they roll And spread their frowning curtains; night there lowers With an unusual blackness, and the pole Rocks with the bolt, as if the knell of nature tolled. CXXIII. In hazy gloom the threatening tempest broods, Crowning with ebon wreaths the mountain's cone, And holding in its magazine the floods That soon will hurry headlong from its throne, From rock to rock impetuous pouring down Their dark, foam-crested waters, as the mane Waving amid the rush of war, and drown, In their wide-wasting waves, the cultured plain, And bear flocks, forests, towns, and harvests to the main. CXXIV. And see,—the cloudy billows heave their surges, In airy tides, along yon western wall, Now swiftly rolling as the roused wind urges, Now hanging silent as the wild blasts fall, Drooping in massy folds, as if the pall Of all these sweet scenes o'er us were outspread; Even as a spectre rising grim and tall At night to some scared wanderer, fancy-led, Sullen and dim and dark, towers yonder mountain's head. CXXV. A solemn pause,—the woods below are still; No breezes wave their light leaves, and the lake Lies like a sleeping mirror; on the hill The white flocks eye the rain-drops, that will slake Their hot thirst, and the screaming curlews take Their circling flight along the silent stream; Save their storm-loving music now awake, Nature seems slumbering in a midnight dream; She starts!—behold aloft that sudden, quivering gleam. CXXVI. The torch is lit among the clouds,—the peals Roar through the lonely wilds, and echoing swell Around the far horizon;—earth now feels And trembles as she listens. Who can tell The spirit's awe? as if it heard its knell, It bows before the Power, whose hand controls Lightning and wind and waves, who loves to dwell In storms, and on its path the tempest rolls, Whose words are bolts, whose glance electric pierces souls, CXXVII. And makes the bold blasphemer pale with awe, And stills the madman's laugh, and strikes with dread The brow, that bore defiance to the law Stamped on the universe; he hides his head In darkness like the ostrich; all those led By his once fearless mocking slink away, And o'er them prostrate, wrathful angels tread, And draw their fiery arrows, and repay With fear and death the hearts that dare to disobey. CXXVIII. 'Tis night, and we are on the mountain-top: The air is motionless, and not a breath Of wind is whispered, and the pure dews drop From heaven, like tears, upon this lovely death Of nature, while the landscape underneath, And the vast arch above, smile in the ray Of the full moon, who, circled in her wreath Of glory, walks, a queen, her lofty way, And pours upon the world a softer, calmer day. CXXIX. The hills, the plains, and meadows, far below, Sparkle with watery diamonds, and the stream That steals in oft meanders, in its flow Of peacefulness, is silvered with her beam, And the round basins in the woodlands seem Like mirrors circled in a pearly row, And like the colors of the dying bream, The soft mists hovering round them, bear the bow, The aerial brede of light, lit with a mellower glow, CXXX. Than when it sits majestic on the storm, What time it hangs along the eastern sky, The herald of returning calm, its form, As imaged erst, a maid of peaceful eye, Who on her dewy saffron wings would fly, And roll away the clouds along the wind, And laughing as she saw the car on high Shine in its full effulgence, as the mind, Whom sense can never sink, nor passion's fury blind. CXXXI. So rolls that car along its arch of blue, And shines with a serener effluence; air Wakened by fanning breezes, charms anew The flushed cheek with its coolness; heaven is fair, A speck dims not its liquid azure, there The eye can rest with calmness, and the green And bloom of grass and flowers new richness wear, And sweeter incense rises from the bean And jessamine and rose, that scent this dewy scene. CXXXII. As when the twilight of a weary life Comes on with quietness and purity, And, after vainly struggling in the strife Of pleasure or ambition, from the eye The film falls, and the mantling vapors fly, And man stands forth in his pure, native worth, And, after tears for lost years hurried by, The soul awakens to a second birth, And for a few hours knows there is a heaven on earth. CXXXIII. Live for the present moment, but live so As you might live for ever; let the cares And toils of this poor transient being go, And pluck the fruit the tree of knowledge bears, And gaze upon the charms which virtue wears, Till her eye's light has filled and warmed your breast;— Be strong and bold and active;—he who dares Contend in virtue's panoply is blest Alone with Heaven's unstained, enduring, noiseless rest. CXXXIV. Give me the evening of a summer's day, A long bright day of glory, when the sun Is most effulgent, and the earth most gay, And after deeds of lofty daring done, And palms on many a field of combat won, Where tempests rage, or noontide glows with power, And when the mind its high career has run, To seek a covert at this silent hour, Where songs and gales may lull in some secluded bower. CXXXV. 'T is night, and winds are hushed;—the leaves are still, Or scarcely ruffle on the poplar bough, And where a stream of waving light, the rill Drips o'er the face of yonder mountain's brow, The moonbeams shine as on Endymion; now The forests are unpeopled of those gay And lovely nymphs and wanton fauns, but how They gave the fancy of the poet play, And threw a rosy hue and perfume o'er his lay! CXXXVI. The Spring came forth, and with her came a train Of hours and loves and graces; every bower Concealed its nymph, and every flowery plain Was full of light-winged Cupids; for the power Of love awaked the universe, the hour, When Hymen lit his torch, and Psyche came Wrapped in the embrace of Eros, and a shower Of sweets was poured around them, and a flame Shot from the glowing eyes of that enamored dame. CXXXVII. She gave her soul to love, and on her lip Her heart stood, and he kissed the prize away, More sweet than when the dews from roses drip In spangles on the grass, in early day, When emerald sylphs on airy pinions play, And lightly hover, as the leaves unfold And spread their vermeil velvet, in the ray Poured through the leafy canopy, and rolled O'er all the bloom below in waving floods of gold: CXXXVIII. The lilac purpling with its luscious spires, Breathing a milky sweetness, like the balm From Aden's groves of myrrh, where summer fires The living world to rapture; but the calm, Cool shade of spreading maples, than the palm With all its crimson clusters charms me more; The violet, lurking underneath the halm Of withered grass tufts, has a dearer store Of sweets, than all the flowers that glow on Ceylon's shore. CXXXIX. The heart cannot be cold in such a shade; It will be melted, as the icy stream That steals with limpid current through the glade, And murmurs not in winter, but the beam Of warmth dissolves it; as a fleeting dream The fretted icicles are gone, the wave, Gliding o'er snowy sands in morning's gleam, Chimes like the song of sorrow Cycnus gave, In tones of dying woe, around his brother's grave. CXL. How poor, how weak, how impotent is man! Cradled in imbecility, the prey Of those who love him fondest, who will fan His passions by indulgence, and will sway To sense and self, and pride and fear, and play Their apish tricks upon him, till his soul Has lost its native innocence; the ray Kindled from Heaven, while feeble yet, is stole By sirens, and then quenched in pleasure's mantling bowl. CXLI. The foaming goblet sparkles to the brim, And heedless youth hangs o'er the glowing stream, And in its amber waters gayly swim The fairest visions of enchantment's dream, And o'er it plays a soft and sunny beam, That steals in serpent windings to the heart, And like a viper's hid in roses gleam The flashings of its keen eyes, as a dart With venom tipped, they give deep wounds that ne'er depart. CXLII. We lie along in gay voluptuous ease,— The full vine mantles o'er us, and our pillow Of mingled moss and flowers; the hum of bees Sucking the dew of roses, and the willow Now hung in downy bloom, and clothed in yellow, Comes like a drowsy zephyr on the ear, And the clear-flowing fountain murmurs mellow, And airy birds in mazy circles veer, And all seems fair and bright as some celestial sphere. CXLIII. We sip the cup of promise, and we drain With eager lip its nectar, till the fume Mounts kindling to the wild and heated brain; And then all things a richer tint assume, And are enrobed in splendor, and illumed With gay looks, and bright eyes, and speaking glances, And laughing frolic waves her spangled plume, And revelry with light step featly dances, And on their rainbow-wings flit round a crowd of fancies. CXLIV. And from our couch we spring,—we scarce can tread This poor earth in our ecstasy; on high We float through fields of ether, overhead Swells with a bluer, loftier arch the sky, And on an eagle's wings we seem to fly, And all the kingdoms of the world appear In dazzling beauty to the fancy's eye, And like the tuneful spirit of some sphere, The sweet winds pour full floods of music in our ear. CXLV. As breezes from Sabæa o'er the main Waft fragance on their pinions from the groves Of myrrh and cassia, and the snowy plain Of coffee-blossoms, where the Queen of Loves, Drawn in her pearly car by purple doves, Would linger with most fondness on her way; A land of passion,—under shady coves Hollowed in living rock, they spend the day, To see their houries dance and hear their citherns play. CXLVI. The past is gone,—it can return no more, The dew of life exhaled, its glory set; It has no other goods for me in store, It is a dreary wilderness, and yet I fondly look and linger. In the net Of pleasure all the breathings of my soul, The burning thoughts alone on Learning set In tender childhood, pointed to the goal Where bards and sages aimed, in youth blind leaders stole, CXLVII. And vile companions rifled, and they left My heart dispirited and sunk and poor, Of all its highest hopes and wants bereft, A pinnace on the waves with naught to moor Or bind it to the safe bank; from the shore, Where my best powers stood weeping, o'er the deep, Tossing and madly heaving, wild winds bore My dark, distracted being, where fiends keep Their orgies, and the worm that gnaws will never sleep. CXLVIII. There is no hope;—ten years the winds have blown, That bore me to my ruin, and the waves Roll in my wake like mountains. Joy has flown, And left behind the lonely, turfless graves Of early, fond attachments;—like the slaves Bound fettered to the galley, at the oar Still I must toil uncheered, or in the caves, Where not a ray of hope comes, I must pour Tears, bitter tears, that well from the heart's bleeding core. CXLIX. The soul that had its home with me was bright, Its early promise as the flowers of spring, Profuse in richness as the dawning light, When the gay, rosy-footed hours take wing, And from the glowing east the coursers spring, That bear the car of day along its road, And o'er a waking world their radiance fling,— So bright the stream of mind within me flowed, It had one only wish,—to scale the high abode, CL. Where Truth has reared her awful throne, and pure Platonic Beauty sits, a smiling bride, The Majesty that bows, and to allure The winning charms of Virtue by his side. Cursed be the drawling pedants, who divide The monarch from his lovely queen, and sink The soul in stupid awe, too soon to hide Its coward head in Pleasure's lap, and drink Her tempting, fiery draughts.—Stop! ye are on the brink CLI. Of endless woe and ruin;—sleep no more,— The charm will soon be broken. Ye will wake, And find the alluring hours that wooed you o'er, And, rising like a fury, Vice will shake Her smoky torch, and in your heart's blood slake Its hell-lit fires, and you will seek in vain The young days that have vanished; in the lake, That priests have drawn so highly, there remain But years of hopeless thought, and still returning pain. CLII. The world may scorn me, if they choose,—I care But little for their scoffings,—I will think Freely, while life shall linger on, and there I find a plank, that bears me;—I may sink For moments, but I rise again, nor shrink From doing what the love of man inspires: I will not flatter, fawn, nor crouch, nor wink At what high-mounted wealth or power desires; I have a loftier aim to which my soul aspires. CLIII. 'Tis of no common order, but is founded On all the capabilities of man, Not like Condorcet's waking dreams, 'tis bounded By what our free, unfettered efforts can, The high career that Tully, Plato, ran, Or higher still, the ideal they could form. 'T is ignorance, not nature, puts the ban On these bright, perfect visions, which could warm Worthies of old, who lived in virtue's darkest storm. CLIV. They saw man sunk around them, grovelling, vile, A mass of brutal grossness, shivering fear, Follies, that made the cold Abderite smile And on his fellows look with bitter sneer, And squalid woes, that drew the Ephesian's tear, Which flowed for miseries he could not heal; So wept the man, to whom all life was dear, Whose heart was made most sensitive to feel, And from a wretched world in hopeless sorrow steal. CLV. He could not cure the malady,—too deep The poisoned dart was planted; but he gave His witness, and his voice should never sleep, A warning sound should issue from his grave, And tell to ages words, which heard might save From woes like those he suffered, woes like mine; The man who will speak boldly, and will brave A thoughtless world's contempt, deserves to shine Bright in the loftiest niche of Fame's enduring shrine. CLVI. To feel a heart within thee, tender, flowing In tears at others pain, and racked with thine, A soul that longs for high attainments, glowing For all that can ennoble, raise, refine, Whose dearest longings seem almost divine, The insatiate grasp for knowledge, and the aim Of tireless, fearless virtue, then to pine, Unknown, unvalued, and to quench the flame Of mind in some low slough, and bid farewell to fame. CLVII. And why? because no hand was near to check The wanderings of my childhood, but their care, If care it could be called, which caused my wreck, Made sin's descending path to me seem fair; They poured her tempting fruits and viands there, And kindled in my heart the lava-stream Of wasting passion;—now I wake, and bare Before me lie the horrors of that dream, Which poor, perverted youth the fairest Eden deem. CLVIII. The world will never pity woes like mine,— 'T is only justice pouring out her flood. I ask no pity, nor will I incline Weakly before the cross, nor in the blood Of others wash away my crimes;—I stood Alone, wrapped in suspicion and despair, For they did goad me early to that mood;— I hate not men, but yet I will not share Again their follies, hopes, their toils and fears, nor wear CLIX. The mantle of the hypocrite, nor bow Before a fancied power, nor lisp the creed Which offers them new life, they know not how, A blind belief, whose ministers will lead, Even as a hireling slave the shackled steed, The many, who to Nature's laws are blind. The heart whom early wrongs have taught to bleed, When blended with a bright and well-stored mind, In solace such as this, no hope, no joy can find. CLX. I will not lift my hand against those laws, Which Nature wears enstamped upon her, nor Gird me to battle in so weak a cause, Nor waste my efforts in so fruitless war; But I will weep the hopes I panted for, Which virtue might have made reality, And know that fortune with malignant star Lighted my path, and with an evil eye Left me to those who crawled in Epicurus' stye. CLXI. I see the charms of Virtue;—can I take Again her narrow path, which leads to Heaven? Beside it flows a fountain, which can slake The temperate thirst of nature, there are given Fruits which refresh, not kindle;—I have striven Against the long perversions of my frame, And I will strive; but no, by passion driven, In evil hour I do the deed of shame, And for a time I quench the soul's reviving flame. CLXII. I have no hand to cheer me;—was there one, Whom I must ever long for, was that heart Still mine in all my failings, as the sun Wakens a slumbering world, she might impart New being to me, and my soul would start, As giants from their sleep, to run the race Of glory, and to hurl the unerring dart, Where Victory rears her palm-branch. No, my chase Of fame is done, and left behind it scarce a trace. PART II. I. Awake, thou sleeper, from thy languid dream Of pleasure crowned with roses; thou must take Anew the harp of solemn tone,—a theme Demands thee to attune it, which should wake The fire within thy bosom hid, and break The flowery fetters that entwine thee. Hark! A clear voice calls thee, where the blue waves make Music around the light and bounding bark, That rides the shoreless sea of mind, a heaven-built ark. II. Fair shines the sun to greet thee on thy way Over the hurried ocean, heaven is clear In its serenest vestment, light winds play And sport along the billows, far and near Earth, air, and sea are beautiful, a sphere Of purest light o'erhangs thee, full the sail Swells, as the north-wind, in its mild career, With the still breathing of a summer gale, O'er the long-rolling deep doth steadily prevail. III. On with thy voyage! leave the darker shore, Where keener spirits feel their light grow dim, And as thy white wing hastens on before The breath of heaven, exalt thy farewell hymn; Weave the fresh flowers to crown thy goblet's brim, And pour thy offering to the powers who keep Watch o'er the waters, while the vessel's rim Rides low along the green wave, up the steep Climbing, or sinking soft into the furrowed deep. IV. On o'er the boundless waters! thou wilt bear Prayers for mild winds and sunshine; every soul, That hath a portion of Heaven's fire, will share In all thy fortunes: whether ocean roll Calm in a mellowed brightness, or the whole Wrath of the tempest lash it, still steer on, Joyous or firm in courage; man's control Is on the sea, and proudest wreaths are won Alone in those wild storms where hardest deeds are done. V. Up with thy swelling canvas! now the gale Woos thee to strain thy cordage, down the bay The small waves fleet, like quick streams down the dale, Speeding o'er polished stones their babbling way; The shrill voice of the air forbids thy stay, It summons thee to take the gift it throws With such a smile before thee:—now when day Sits on its high throne, and the pure sky glows Unclouded, as the form of things in beauty rose; VI. Now, in this noon of life, this jubilee Of the united elements, this flow Of soul from eye to eye, this harmony Of all that shine above with all below In their unfaded loveliness, this glow Of nature in its manhood; now expand All to the embrace of the sweet airs, that blow, Wafting fresh odors from the bowers they fanned, To meet the sweeter breath of a diviner land: VII. Where on the coast the flowering myrtles bend, Laden with Love's own garlands; in its rear Towers a fair summit, where all treasures blend, That Spring showers from her full urn; one may hear Voices that speak all melody, tones dear To young hearts, as the tones of those we love; Sweeter the mellow touch, the more we near The thicket where it dwells, as from her cove The stock-dove's widowed voice comes wailing thro' the grove. VIII. Such is the land that welcomes thee afar To cut thy long, bright track, and proudly go, Led by the light of a celestial star, That from its seat of beauty sparkles so, As mind from its dark portal; in the flow Of the broad stream of ocean, with thy sky The dome to crown thy temple, and the glow Of suns to light and cheer thee, send on high, From off thy full-toned harp, sounds that should never die; IX. But with the hymns that have been sung, of old Burning on lips of inspiration, glowing Deep in those ancient hearts of keener mould, With tireless energy their treasure throwing In lavish gifts around them, and bestowing New being on the wanderer of the wild; Those spirits nerved with intellect, all-knowing, Whose voice now roused in terror, now they smiled, Reading soft words of love to the delighted child; X. With these, and all who have been of the train, That hold the power of harmony to give Joy unto others, as the melting rain Wakens the earth, so that all freshly live, And, as again in infancy, revive With an intenser hue and shade of green, When the waked bees come thicker from their hive,— O, when these lords of harmony convene, There be the farewell hymn that paints the parting scene. XI. Farewell to the lost land, where life was young, And the fresh earth seemed lovely; where the heart First felt the thrill of ecstasy, when, strung With its fine tender chords, all could impart Joy to its laughing innocence—I start To find I am so cold, where all before Was tinctured with divinity—we part, Land of my early loves! thy once bright shore Has lost its dearest charm. Farewell! we meet no more. XII. The world that is, seems Eden to the child; The rainbows on a bubble are a spell To chain him in sweet wonder; O, how wild Do the first wakened throbs of feeling swell! There is no music like the village bell, That o'er the far hills sends its silver sound, There is no beauty like the forms, that dwell In flower and bud, and shell and insect, found, When through the watered vale we take our infant round. XIII. But this is for the new mind,—soon we tire Of all this simple loveliness we form Within a magic fane, whose sun-gilt spire Burns in the azure firmament,—the storm Is portion of its majesty, we warm, Not tremble in the lightning's vivid glare,— Sounds must be heard from Heaven, that they inform The spirit with the life of thought, and bear, Through all their unseen flight, the souls that upward dare. XIV. The world imagined, to the world we feel, Is glory and magnificence; we turn From earth in sated weariness, but kneel Before the pomp we dream of;—when the urn Holds all that now hath form and life, we spurn The shackles that debase us and confine; Deep in its central fountain mind will burn Brighter in darkness, like the gems that shine With a fixed eye of fire, the stars of cave and mine. XV. When the gay visions once so fair are fled, When Time has dropped his rose-wreaths, and his brow Hath only snows to shade it; hearts have bled, And healed themselves to be all callous; now, In the cold years of vanished hope, we plough And sow in barrenness, to reap in blight,— Then the soul in its solitude doth bow To its own grandeur, and from outer night Turns to the world within, and finds all love and light. XVI. Darkness hath then no covering, but its veil Is as a pictured curtain o'er a scene, That hides the life of some bewitching tale, And is itself all beauty; on the green Before an ancient temple walks the queen Of smiles, dispensing happiness to choirs Of youths and maidens, whose ecstatic mien Tells of the heart within, whose keen desires Burn with the pure flame lit from Love's Olympian fires. XVII. Not kindled from the altar, which below Stood in Idalia, bowered in myrtle shades, The shrine of him who bore the burning bow, Whose earthly passion, ere it ripens, fades: 'T is the one Spirit, who with light pervades The infinite of being, but controls Alike the insect floating through the glades On the soft air of June, or human souls New in their merry morn, or all that lives and rolls XVIII. Wide through the waste of ether, sun or star, All linked by Harmony, which is the chain That binds to earth the orbs that wheel afar Through the blue fields of Nature's wide domain; From the last glimmerer in the starry train, To that which is to us the God of day, From the beam glancing on the tossing main, To the full floods that o'er creation play, And feed the lamps of life, all feel that boundless sway. XIX. Love is attraction, and attraction love;— The meeting of two fond eyes, and the beat Of two accordant pulses, are above Planets, that always tend, but never meet: To us, that have a feeling, love is sweet, The life of our existence, the great aim Of all our hope and beauty,—but they fleet, Moments of fond endearment,—years will tame The electric throb of bliss, and quench the spirit's flame. XX. But yet there is to us a purer light, And that is in the beautiful unfading, The mould wherein all phantoms of delight Are fashioned into loveliness; the shading Of earth may give it softness, kindly aiding The weakness of our feebler nature, while Mind has not fledged its pinions; soon pervading Space in its daring, as a long-sought isle, It turns with naked gaze to that Eternal smile, XXI. Whose charm is on the universe, the blue Mellowed with light's full essence on the sphere Wrapping us in its mantle, whence the dew Falls clear and pearly, like a tender tear Shed on the hues, that fade so quickly here, But are awhile so beautiful,—the sea That smooths its gold, or, as the light winds veer, Crisps it, or decks it o'er with stars,—the sea Takes all it hath to charm, Eternal Love! from thee. XXII. And thee the fountains worship, where they lie Curling in silent loveliness, or sending Through the flowered vale the brook that prattles by, Twinkling o'er polished pebbles; willows bending Wave in thy soft breath, when its fragrance lending Balm to the new spring makes the earth perfume: All hues, that, o'er the tufted meadow blending, As the wind sinks or rises oft, assume New shades and tints, in thee expand their buds and bloom. XXIII. In thee all creatures gladden, on the air Moving their filmy wings, or calm at sail Skimming the winding water sheeted fair, As the sun walks above it,—their bright mail Burns on the polished mirror, which doth veil To the bossed form, that studs it like a gem,— Whether their serried pinions cut the gale, Or their quick-glancing fins the current stem, Or earth is their domain,—thy life enkindles them. XXIV. And man becomes thy worshipper, when first The sense of beauty wakens him to kneel Before the images which thou hast nurst, And stamped them with thy deep eternal seal,— Forms from which age and ruin cannot steal The pure, free grace of nature;—but they wear The magic charm, in which we live and feel That we have caught a higher sense, and bear New-wrought within our souls the essence of the fair. XXV. And to those forms of light our wishes tend, And our fixed longing is to stand and gaze, Where to the Parian stone the mind doth lend Its own divinity, and pour its rays Harmonious o'er the canvas, where life plays In the flushed cheek, blue veins, and speaking eye, And lip with passion trembling;—Mind can raise From its unseen conceptions, where they lie Bright in their mine, forms, hues, that look Eternity; XXVI. That send through the long waste of ages, pure From the corruption of a grosser time, Those models of perfection, which endure, The guides of all the graceful and sublime In our own nature, fashioned in the clime Of the sweet myrtle, and the kindling vine, Of roseate skies, green vales, and rocks that climb Amid the never-wasting snows, and shine In the glad Sun,—the seat of all they held divine. XXVII. It was from gazing on the fairy hues That hung around the born and dying day, The tender flush, whose mellow stain imbues Heaven with all freaks of light, and where it lay Deep-bosomed in a still and waveless bay, The sea reflected all that glowed above, Till a new sky, softer but not so gay, Arched in its bosom, trembled like a dove, When o'er her silken plumes wanders the light of love. XXVIII. It was from gazing on them, when the flowers First wakened from their wintry sleep, and flung Their first warm tints o'er garden beds and bowers, When from the temple roof the swallow sung, And in the thorny thicket sweetly rung, Through the still moonlight hours, the heart-breathed tone Of the lone warbler,—when the loosed steed sprung Bright o'er the sounding plain, and the charmed zone, In one soft twine of love, round all that lived was thrown. XXIX. When there were dances in the Platane shades, And the vine arbors breathed with music,—Night Looked from her starry throne on youths and maids, Bounding and shouting in their full delight, From the round orb of azure sparkled bright The spirit in its ecstasy, wreathed gold Flowed tressed behind them, as their footsteps light Leaped in the mazy ring, and the wide fold Of mantles waved to fly the clasping girdle's hold: XXX. And feeling voices blended with the lute, Raising the hymn to beauty and to love, The parent and the infant boy,—the flute, In tempered sweetness, flowing like the dove, In her deep sorrow, from the elm above The dark stream sleeping in seclusion; so, As the voice ceased, and Echo from her cove Answered, the flute, in one continual flow, Breathed every winding note and falling touch of woe: XXXI. And smiles were changed to tears, the dance became Still, and the dancers breathless; you might see In the soft dews of sorrow quenched the flame Of buoyant passion;—soon the sound of glee Rang on the merry cymbal, then all free, As the winds hurry o'er the mountains, beat, In numbered steps attuned to melody, Round the close-shaven green their glancing feet, Light as the spotted fawns through Tegean forests fleet. XXXII. And there the pencil and the chisel drew Apollos and Dianas; there they wrought Into one form the charms that nature threw Round the fair youth of Athens; there they sought All the soft lines of elegance, and caught The grandeur too of loveliness, which lends Power to the young god; there they culled and brought From innocent forms the perfect grace, which sends Such magic on the heart of youth, that awed it bends. XXXIII. Once they were planted in a marble fane Built to the power that in the statue stood, Or underneath the blue sky on the plain, Or in the shadow of a sacred wood, Or where the poplar quivered o'er the flood, Itself in air, its image glassed below: But now they stand, the artist's holy food, Where the high dome permits the light to flow, Aloft above the crowd that wondering gaze below. XXXIV. And there they stand, still perfect; though the stain Of centuries has lent to them a hue, Which tells of age and change, 't is not in vain, But is their triumph: they have risen through The roar of ruin round them, to renew Taste in the land of music, and of form, And tint, and shade;—so eagerly we view The long-tost bark, that rudely beat the storm, And rode unharmed, unwrecked, where all its terrors swarm. XXXV. They stand replete with life, the marble speaks, And the cold eye looks passion; they might tell Of cultured fields, where now the dead fen reeks, Of pomp and feast, where bats and night birds dwell; Though from their first-raised pedestal they fell, Yet they revived in glory. It is sure, Stamped by the seal of nature, that the well Of Mind, where all its waters gather pure, Shall with unquestioned spell all meaner hearts allure. XXXVI. We gaze on them, and on the ancient page, And read its mystic characters, which seem, Through the expanding haziness of age, The fading forms of a majestic dream. Cold is the heart, that not on such a theme Feels the warm spirit kindle;—'t is the sound Of a gone trumpet rolling on the stream Of Time, and catching still at each rebound Deeper and clearer tones to bear its warning round, XXXVII. And ever waken from the dull repose Of peace and plenty, where we waste in rust That love of high emprise which ever glows When the roused mind hath sternly shook the dust From off its robe, and in a childlike trust To its own inspiration, and the power That speaks from buried nations, at the bust Of ancient Mind gives worship, in the hour When the waked eyes of Heaven their tempering influence shower. XXXVIII. Language of Gods and godlike men! thy tone First sounded on Olympus from the lyre Of the glad virgins, when around the throne They raised the joyful Pæan, in a choir Alternate with Apollo, sitting higher, The sovereign of all harmony;—thence came That sounding speech, whose words, imbued with fire, Could the wild wave of Athens bend and tame, And wreathe the poet's harp with locks of lambent flame. XXXIX. Thy faintest tone is music,—when thy words Come o'er my ear, I seem on wings at play With every bard who sung thee, like the birds Who feed on dewy air, and float in day, Speeding in endless round their lives away, Aloft above the region of the storm, Where naught can soil their golden plumes, nor stay Their swift career,—no sudden gust deform The beauty of their flight, but all is still and warm, XL. And the clear sun stands over them, his hair Waves gloriously athwart the perfect blue; There is no rustling in the deep, calm air, But one eternal tide is rolling through The far expanse, and thus it ever drew The waves of ether in its willing train; Higher than ever wing of eagle flew, Or white curl dimmed the noon-vault with its stain, There, bird of Eden, spreads thy pure and bright domain. XLI. And thou too hast a voice, and oft at night, When thy wing winds among the stars, 't is said By those who watch the sky in fixed delight, On fairy dreams of wooing fortune led, When the cool winds around the flowery bed Hid in the garden alcove long delay Because the spot is fragrant, then 't is said The midnight gazer hears thee far away, Like a sweet angel's voice, salute the coming day. XLII. Fit image of those subtile kindled souls, Who spurned at baseness, and arose from earth Indignantly, who fixed in Heaven their goals, Whose only rival was departed worth; Whose restless passion labored in the birth Of moral greatness;—whether on the page, Statue, or canvas, round the quiet hearth, On the loud Pnyx, or in the sanguine rage Of fight,—they sought to charm and conquer every age. XLIII. And this with such a language, sweetly blending All in one round of fulness, that it flowed A streamlet or a torrent, ocean sending Its blue waves on its rocky barrier,—glowed Sparkles of beauty thickly o'er it,—strode Mind on its breast, like Gods, who sail through air Throned on a tempest-cloud,—whether the ode Burned, or the epic thundered, or the fair, Fond Lesbian sighed and wooed, the magic sound was there. XLIV. Yes, but the accent, the nice touch and tone, Have perished with the tongues whose melody Was Music's essence. Yes, the sound has flown With the keen life aloft, where it will be Absorbed and blended in Eternity, The spirit of a grander, purer time: Language of Heaven, O lend thy voice to me! Give me the perfect note, the tempered chime, That I at times may feel and live with the sublime; XLV. That I may read the rhapsodies and odes, And proud harangues, and flowing histories, Those flights where mortals mingled with the Gods, And threw their eye beyond the life that is; Those sun-bright lessons of the good and wise, Those golden songs of a diviner age,— O, could my mind but gain that long-sought prize, O, could I take the early Grecian rage, And pour Homeric fire along my wandering page,— XLVI. There should be altars to thee, and the flame Should be ethereal, no gross earthly fire Should taint their marble purity, but tame The spark of Heaven should tremble down the wire, And with the lightest element conspire To roll full floods of snowy light to thee, And I would warm my spirit in that pyre, And all that lives within my heart should be Devoted to thy will, Eternal Harmony! XLVII. Are there not moments when we fly from earth And dwell in ether? Are there no bright hours Along the dull of life? Is not the dearth Of feeling quickened, and the dormant powers Wakened, by living with the domes and towers We fly to o'er the bounding sea? O fane Of Grecian wisdom! that in ruin lowers Over the rage of ignorance, again Thou shalt be bright, renewed, and pure from every stain. XLVIII. And I would go, and worship at thy door; I dare not enter, where thy form doth rear That beaming lance, which stilled the battle's roar, And stopped the clang of sword, the hum of spear, Cutting the murk air in its dark career, And thirsting for the shouting warrior's blood; I feel within my soul a holy fear Forbidding me to enter thy abode, Where none but grandest minds and purest hearts have trod. XLIX. Wisdom enshrined in beauty,—O, how high The order of that loveliness! the blue That rolls and flashes in thy full, round eye, Thy forehead arched with such a stainless hue, As crowns the eternal mountains lifted through The gathered night of clouds, the smile, the frown, Blended in sweetness,—all in thee can view How mind and virtue linked alone bring down On mortal heads from Heaven the star-wreathed laurel crown. L. Would I might stand beneath thy temple's roof, Closed from the entrance of all common light, From all the sound and stir of man aloof, Whose dark air makes thy ægis doubly bright, As the broad flash glares through the cloud of night With an intenser redness,—could I stand Beneath thy roof, and from thy pure lips write The volume of all Truth,—but no! my hand Will not,—I am not one by whom thy lore is scanned. LI. No, I should rather fly among the bowers That bloom around the Idalian dome, and take From soft Sicilian plains the leaves and flowers, Of which a coronal of love to make;— Better for me a seat beside the lake, Where the enchanter erst his wild harp hung To moulder in the birches. Why not wake Those witching notes again? Shall they be flung To the wild mountain winds from chords so long unstrung? LII. And now I turn me to the misty island, Which rises with its white cliffs from the ocean, I turn to where the storm broods on the highland, And the sea lifts its waves in angry motion, And there again I feel a new devotion Come with a spell of power athwart me; light Burns, blazes over Greece, but wild commotion Heaves in the bosoms of the North; their flight Is on the whirlwind's wing, their home the womb of night. LIII. They follow nature, who hath girt their hills With a dark belt of pines, whose fitful roar, Far wafted on the wind, the stout heart fills With its own wild sublimity; the shore Breasts the rude shock of waves, that rush before The north-wind bursting from the icy pole; Yon peaks, that lift their foreheads bald and hoar, Where the long wreaths, that tell of tempest, roll, Stamp mightily and deep their grandeur on the soul. LIV. They love the rock, whose dark brow beetles far Into the wallowing ocean, whose white waves Join round the thundering crag in mingled war, Where in the hollow cavern echo raves, Like the long groans that seem to come from graves, When sheeted spectres burst their cerements; high The gannet wheels and screams, then, stooping, braves The fury of the surge that rushes by, And then rolls dim and far to mingle with the sky. LV. Their home is on the mountain, where in mist They darkly dwell, and when the hollow sound Of the crushed woods comes on, they fondly list To hear the winds wake up, and gather round, Till from each rocky battlement they bound, Mingling and deepening, like the waves in war, Which on the mid-sea heave and strive around The rock, that dares their madness; loud afar Rolls on the foam-lit main the rush of Odin's car. LVI. And when the night comes down, and deeper gloom Falls on the cloud, that wraps the height in shade, When the mist moves away, and opens room To catch a glimpse of lakes in moonlight laid, For all below is by the clear wind made Serene in brightness, then the lone bard throws A glance on distant beauty, and the maid, White as the foam that on the lashed wave rose, Sits lonely in her bower, and weeps her tender woes. LVII. Their tenderness is dark; it hath the hue Of their own watery skies, and thence they bear Its tints of paleness, for the light sent through The floating veil of mist, that dims the air, Sheds a faint glimmering on the landscape there, So that the earth seems weeping; when they mourn Their tones are wild, but soft; they do not tear With a new pang the heart already torn, That finds in the still look what kills, yet must be borne. LVIII. The soaring of their heights uplifts the soul, And gives their heavenward daring to the heart, And the tossed waves, that midway round them roll, Seeming below, as if they were a part Of a new ocean raging there, will dart Their sternness on the eye, that loves to rise From the low vale, and as it gazes start To see above them floating in the skies Peaks white with eldest snow, and gilt with sunset dyes. LIX. Dofra, thy brow is in that upper air, No cloud e'er went as high, the eagle's wing Has been thy only visitant, thy bare And pillared cone is such a glorious thing To the far-gazing Norseman, when the sting Of a fond love of country prompts him on To worship at thy base, and upward spring To thy eternal walls, which in the sun Flash far and purely forth, when the long day is done. LX. Far round thy fir-shagged base the torrent winds, Hoarse as the voice of Liberty, who bears With open breast the tempest, when it binds Seas in its chain of frost, whose brow still wears Part of its once deep frown, the will that dares All, when invasion threats,—that torrent leaps Down the dark gulf, and with its dashing tears The rock in deeper rents, and ever keeps Wild music in the wood, that o'er it bends and weeps; LXI. The roar of waters, and the rush of winds Through the black boughs, whose tangled branches throw Night o'er the rift, where the dashed vapor blinds, And distant down the gushing waters glow In their intense convulsion, as they go Plunging and lifting high their frothy swell; Then, as a new-sprung arrow, on they flow, Roaring along a pit that seems a hell, Where the shook caverns ring their echoes like a knell. LXII. So Mind takes color from the cloud, the storm, The ocean, and the torrent: where clear skies Brighten and purple o'er an earth, whose form In the sweet dress of Southern summer lies, Man drinks the beauty with his gladdened eyes, And sends it out in music;—where the strand Sounds with the surging waves, that proudly rise To meet the frowning clouds, the soul is manned To mingle in their wrath, and be as darkly grand. LXIII. Nature! when looking on thee, I become Renewed to my first being, and am pure, As thou art bright and lovely; from the hum Of cities, where men linger and endure That wasting death, which kills them with a sure But long-felt torture, I now haste away To climb thy rugged rocks, and find the cure Of all my evils, and again be gay In the clear sun, that gilds the fair autumnal day. LXIV. I cannot look upon those cloudless skies, And not be lifted, for they seem to spread With an unbounded vastness, and they rise Beyond the height where early fancy, led By its own grand aspirings, which were fed On hopes nursed in their shrines below, had given To the first powers their throne; so o'er my head, As by an ever-moving hand still driven, Wider and wider spreads the azure deep of heaven. LXV. I gaze and I am vaster;—thought takes wing From off the rock I stand on, and goes far Into the pure blue gulf, and there I bring The myriad bands of night, and set each star In its peculiar station, till they wear All forms of brightness, and a magic train, Show all the fabled world in picture there, And then I seem to range them o'er again, Like him who read them first on the Chaldæan plain. LXVI. But Nature! thou hast more beneath me bright In their rich autumn tints, than all I throw Over the crystal arch, whose tranquil light Takes every hue of mellowness below; It kindles in the orchard's ruddy glow, And on the colored woods, whose dying shade Crowns the tall mountain with a wreath, whose flow, Softly descending to the silent glade, Seems like the evening cloud in airy tints arrayed. LXVII. And where the river winds along the vale, Bending through sloping hills, which o'er it lift Oaks faintly yielding to the rudest gale, And clinging with close twining to the rift Of the steep rocks, which, as the wild winds drift The rain-clouds o'er their quivering tops, still rise Contending with the gust, whose flight is swift, Scouring with stormy wing the cold, dun skies, On which the flock look up with faint, imploring eyes. LXVIII. Through that low, watered vale a sanguine stream Winds, where the maple gives its leaf a hue Of deepest carmine, and those wreathed boughs Tupelo. teem With the same tint of blood and berries blue; Deeper their contrast, as they meet us through The oak's dark russet and the walnut's brown; There we might weave of falling leaves a new And brighter wreath than earth e'er gave to crown The sun of lower life, before its light went down. LXIX. There is a pensive spirit in those woods, The sighing of the lone wind in their leaves Has much to soften; there the sunk heart broods Intenser o'er its many wrongs, and grieves With a far purer sorrow; it believes, With fond illusion, that a form is there Who hath her sorrows too; and then he weaves Of the pale-tinted flowers a wreath, to bear On his dishevelled locks, the garland of despair. LXX. To look upon thy form, thou dying year, To see thy brightest honors thickly shed, As withered flowers are scattered on a bier By pious hands, who mourn a loved one dead; To think how all that Spring and Summer spread Of freshness and maturity are torn By the rude winds, how coldly in their stead The crusted frost hangs glimmering on the thorn, And bends the widowed boughs, that stoop as if forlorn: LXXI. To think on this, and on the breathing hues That wreathed the same earth in its fairest prime, When the glad season with its life imbues The very clods, and wakens from the slime Of the low marsh new forms, that spread a time A pictured mantle o'er it; when it blows, Mocking the beauty of a tropic clime, Where one eternal round of flowering throws New bloom to crown the fruit, that swells and ripening glows: LXXII. To think on infancy, and then on death, In the wild herb, or those fair forms we bind Close to our hearts, as if their life and breath Were portion of our being, where the mind Is heightened, and all sympathies refined To that high state where we are not our own. To think on death—to leave the looks, that wind Round all our thoughts their tenderness,—alone To sit and hear the winds make sad and solemn moan LXXIII. Through the dark pines, whose foliage, in the sway Of fitful gusts, waves mournfully, and throws From its fine threads a sound, that sinks away Faintly and sweetly, to a dying close, Like a soft air to which the boatman rows Over the moon-lit lake his gliding keel, Which comes more calmly, for the still wind blows So meekly through the summer night, we feel Scarce on our wakeful ear the whispered echo steal,— LXXIV. To think on death, and how it rends the links Of long and close communion, how it tears One and another chord, till the heart sinks Without one friend on whom to lay its cares, And take his in return;—the spirit bears Better a loved one's woes, than those it feels Spring in its own lost hopes;—the heart that shares With a long bosom-friend his burdens, heals Its wounds, and still is soft;—alone, their closing steels. LXXV. 'Tis good to think on death;—it bends the will From that stern purpose which no man can hold And yet be happy;—we must go and fill Thought with affection, where pale mourners fold The shroud around those chill limbs, whose fair mould Imaged unearthly beauty. Why not blend With tears awhile, and leave that stern, that cold Contempt of all that waits us, when we end Our proud career in death, where all, hope-lifted, bend. LXXVI. 'Tis good to hold communion with the dead, To walk the lane where bending willows throw Gloom o'er the dark green turf, ere day is fled, And cast deep shadow on the tomb below; For, as we muse thus silently, we know The worth of all our longings, and we pay New worship unto purity, and so We gather strength to take our toilsome way, Which must be meekly borne, or life be thrown away. LXXVII. Better live long and tranquilly, if pure, Than rush into the madness of a crowd, Where all are eager for the prize, none sure; Where busy voices clamor long and loud, And man shows in the strife how feebly proud Are his best aims to raise himself, and cast His fellows in his rear;—how keen, when bowed Beneath a firmer heel, he finds at last, Are the condemning thoughts, that mock him, of the past. LXXVIII. But I must turn again to higher themes, And, from the lifted summit where I stand Casting a rapid glance o'er hills and streams, That checker with their light a happy land, Must find again my better powers expand To a fit harmony with earth and sky, Which spread before me, with so vast a hand, Those forms that seem to bear eternity Stamped on their iron brows, where age will ever be: LXXIX. The gray rocks, and the mountains wrapped in blue, Towering far distant through the silent air, That sleeps in noon-light, but in morning blew Fresh o'er the russet plain, and scattered there Shadows from flitting clouds, that earth seemed fair Robed in a sheet of light, and then grew dim;— Far distant through the haze, those mountains bear Sky-lifted walls, that frown along the brim Of earth, and, as I gaze, in vapor seem to swim. LXXX. They rise with twofold vastness through the dun And quivering air, that broods along the heath, Which gilds its dark waste with the reddening sun, Whose sinking light seems ominous of death; Air now is hushed, and not a whispered breath Bears from the cedar-woods one sound away To speak of life; a lightly curling wreath O'er the far lake alone is seen to play, And give one fairy hue to the departing day. LXXXI. 'Tis the fit hour of high and solemn thought; The sun sinks lower, and a wave of flame Burns on the distant peaks; I feel my lot Too scanty for those inner powers, that frame Visions of glory, which no want should tame To the poor level of our common days; I would be with the heights, which stand the same, Catching through countless years the dying rays, That every evening crown the rocks in one full blaze. LXXXII. And here shall be my temple, where I pay Devotion unto Nature, here the throne On which my soul shall sit, and pass away Beyond where ever wing of air has flown, Or first-created beam of morning shone, Through the void infinite, the far expanse, Spread out beyond all life, by thought alone Pervaded, where no atoms in their dance, Ere sun and star came forth, rolled on the waves of chance. LXXXIII. To think is to exist, and when we go Far in the range of intellect, we seem Heightened in our existence: brute below Move the dull crowd, a slow and sluggish stream, Who think us madmen, who on mountains deem There are more lofty musings, and new force Caught from the purer air and clearer beam; They know no upward hours, and as their source Of life is in the dust, such is their being's course. LXXXIV. They are the pillars on which nations rest, Useful, but rude. All beauty took its birth In the rank mould,—now worshipped and caressed, It once lay buried in its parent earth; And thus the mean and sordid have their worth, To bear aloft the finer form, and rear The prouder seat of soul, that sallies forth High in a purer element, to hear The lore of minds who dwell in a celestial sphere; LXXXV. Who have been in the common herd, but long Have found a home more genial, and have grown, From this our infancy of reason, strong In all that gives to intellect the tone Of an exalted essence, such as shone Faint in the bard and sage of ancient days; Earth was around them,—now, they would not own Those visions, where they wandered in a maze Of dreams, that were sublime, and dazzle all who gaze. LXXXVI. But these were dreams of infancy; they broke The chain of earthly appetite,—the will To be all greatness burst the binding yoke That ever bore their spirit downward, till They leaped on a free pinion to fulfil The grandeur they had purposed,—then the sky Received them in its bosom, where they still Haste on in eager hopes that never die, To read all things that are, with an unsated eye. LXXXVII. Space is to them an ocean, where they rush Voyaging in an endless circle; light Comes from within, and as the mountains flush, When morning sails athwart them, so their flight Kindles all things they pass by, with so bright And searching glance, they read them in their core: Like a quick meteor hasting on in night, They wander through a sea without a shore, Which still hath something new to gather to their store. LXXXVIII. And they too have a centre, where they tend; The universe rolls round it; there all power Comes and goes forth; though lesser beings end, Wasting and born and dying every hour, Yet like the fabled amaranthine flower, That ever held the same unfading glow, Shedding its fragrance through the holy bower, Where angels took their slumbers, in a flow That bore a sense of Heaven to purer hearts below,— LXXXIX. Yet, like that never-dying flower, the whole Lives one unchanging round, and ever draws New motion from the animating soul, Which acts on matter with eternal laws, And is to each event the one first cause, From which all changes emanate; like rays, All spirits point to this, and there they pause, And when all worlds are passed, the soul there lays Its separate life aside, and mingles in that blaze. XC. Here we have only moments when we speed Round the aerial ocean, o'er whose tides The mind goes onward, like the breathless steed On which the wretch who flies his ruin rides; But the base will to earth for ever guides The soaring pinion in its highest flight; We cannot go where the free spirit glides Serenely in a flowing wave of light; We may be bright awhile, but more of life is night. XCI. 'Tis a vain toil to send our fancy on, In quest of higher worlds than this we know; Cold want will come, when all we sought is won, And then our new-fledged wing must stoop below; I am not to the hope of Heaven a foe, It comforts, lifts, and widens all who share In the pure streams that from its fountain flow; We must be pure ourselves, if we would dare Take of the holy fire that wells and gushes there. XCII. 'Tis a weak madness, or a base deceit, To talk of hope like this, when life is stained With all rank, reeking grossness;—when we meet, In a fair life, a goodness all unfeigned, Where one long love of purity hath reigned, And the meek spirit charms us, like the rose That in a thicket lurks, and there hath gained Sweetness from all it fed on, till it throws New fragrance on the wind,—we give a Heaven to those. XCIII. They have a heaven on earth: it ever springs In the calm round of tender feeling, shown By the dear cares and toils which Nature wrings, With a most gentle pressure, from the lone But happy parent, who amid her own, Smiling like first-blown flowers around her, feeds Her spirit with their looks of love; unknown She lives within her shrine; her fond heart needs No tongue to tell her worth, to gladden in her deeds. XCIV. They have their own reward: it is the law Of our existence, that our hearts should cling To those who from our life their being draw; The favors that we render ever bring Closer the cherished, till they are a thing We cannot sever from us, but they tear Roots from our hearts; the thankless child may sting, Even as a serpent, but we meekly bear All wrongs, and when the storm beats on him, clasp him there. XCV. The feeling of a parent never dies But with our moral nature; all in vain The wretch, by cold and cruel spurning, tries To change that love to hate: the sense of pain Shoots keenly through a mother's heart, the chain Wound through life's tender years twines closer so; Feelings, that in our better hours had lain Silent, are often waked by some deep throe, And as the torture racks, our loves intenser grow. XCVI. We send these fond endearments o'er the grave: Heaven would be hell, if loved ones were not there, And any spot a heaven, if we could save From every stain of earth, and thither bear The hearts that are to us our hope and care, The soil whereon our purest pleasures grow; Around the quiet hearth we often share, From the quick change of thought, the tender flow Of fondness waked by smiles, the world we love, below. XCVII. But now I turn me to the setting sun, Whose broad fire dips behind yon rock, a tower Fit for the eagle's aerie; day is done, And earth is hushed at evening's dewy hour; Down the high, wooded peak a golden shower Flows through the twinkling leaves, that lightly play In the cool wind, that wakens from its bower, Hung where the curling river winds away Through the green, watered vale, to meet the sheeted bay; XCVIII. On which the moon, who long had watched the set Of the bright lord who gives her light, but dims Her brightness, when they two in heaven are met, Casts her pale shadow, which as softly swims As nymphs who cleave the wave with snowy limbs, Like lilies floating on a falling stream, Whose incense-breathing cup now lightly skims The crinkling sheet, and now with opal gleam Dips in the brook, and takes from air a brighter beam; XCIX. Which is condensed, and parted into hues That charm us in the rainbow; each waved tip Of the glossed petals, in that light imbues Its paleness with an iris fringe; the lip Thus takes a sweeter beauty, when we sip The infant stream of life from some bright bowl Fretted with Eastern flowers; and as they drip From the new rose, the pearls of morning roll Such tints upon the eye, they pass into the soul. C. Sunlight and moonlight now are met in heaven; This, like a furnace blazing in the west, Lifts a wide flame, that, as a banner driven, Glows where the mountain lake unfolds its breast, And every tree in amber locks is tressed, Flowing in waved fire down the green hill-side; Round the far eastern sky the blue is dressed With blushes, like a sweet Circassian bride, Who looks with melting eye on Helle's rolling tide. CI. The vast arch lifts a darker canopy, The perfect dome of nature, reared aloft Above the columned rocks, that send it high, Like a round temple-roof, which rises soft Melting in evening air, where sunbeams waft Flashes, that tip with gold the pointed spire, And crown the statue there, and gem the haft Of the bent sword, that, like a stream of fire, Waves o'er the startled crowd, the sign of God's first ire. CII. But as I turn me to the silent sea, Where not a wind is breathing, no calm swell Creeps slowly whispering on; where in his lee, Through the far deep, the sailor-boy can tell, On the white bed of sand, each twisted shell That lies where never waves in tempest sweep;— I look, and as I hear the vesper bell Swing solemnly afar, the moonbeams keep Watch o'er the silver tide, that now is hushed in sleep. CIII. Day fades, and night grows brighter in her orb, Which walks the blue air with a queen-like smile, And seems with a soft gladness to absorb All the deep blaze that lit yon rocky pile, Where the sun took his farewell glance, the while He rested on the throne of parting day, Which is his royal seat;—as a far isle Rolling amid the upper deep its way, The moon glides on, as glides her shadow on the bay. CIV. Beauty is doubled here, and both are fair, But the reflection hath a paler tint, As when from out a calm and hazy air The first wan rays in frosted autumn glint; The moon aloft comes freshly from the mint, Where first she took her loveliness; the bright And dark she bears, like bosses by the dint Of a deep die, give changes to her light, As if a snowy veil with glittering pearls were dight. CV. Night steals apace, and brings the hour of stars, Which come emerging from heaven's azure flow; First in the west the loving planet bears The charm of light, that hath a power to throw Hope on the impassioned heart, who in her glow Reads the fond omen of his happy flame; She leads the way; then thicker splendors go. Each to his seat, as when at once they came Obedient to the voice whose word all power can tame. CVI. And now the night is full; unnumbered eyes Look on us from infinitude; the dome Whereon they hang, in darker azure lies Round their intenser light; as when the foam Crests the green wave, when barks are hurrying home From the wild cloud that skirts the brooding sky, And gives the sea a frown, before it come To plough the surge in wrath, and roll it by The rock, which in that rush still lifts its forehead high. CVII. They gather on the far-expanded arch, Each in their separate orders, and go on Sweeping the long, dark vault in silent march, Until at last the western goal is won, Or on the orient hill the morning sun Come forth and quench their lesser light; yon plain Is a wide list, where higher souls may run In the bright form of star, and grandly gain The only good reward, which here we seek in vain. CVIII. No wonder nations worshipped here, and bowed Their foreheads in the dust before the fires That watch o'er earth, and seem to speak aloud The deeds of unborn ages;—man aspires To the high seat of gods, and never tires To read the infinite, the past, and throw Looks full of hope before him; so those fires, Which are so high, and look so far, must know All that is big with fate, and will have birth below. CIX. Faith centres in the sky;—'t is there we turn, When earth is only darkness, there we send Our vows to those we fear, and there we burn, When the last pulse beats low, to find the end Of all we hate, and thus in hope we tend To the high dwelling of the stars;—bright souls Love with the purer elements to blend, And so, when the deep knell its parting tolls, They gaze on the pure light that ever round us rolls: CX. So those who have been gifted with the flame Of an ascending intellect, whose light Kindled as death drew near, and seemed the same, Or fairer, on the verge of being's night;— So they have fixed their last look on the bright, Clear sky, as if awhile insphered and bound In a full sense of glory;—their delight Was too intensely keen to have a sound; It spake in the long smile they cast so calmly round. CXI. The sun was setting when the Gueber drew His parting breath; he gazed in worship there, Life seemed concentred in that ardent view, His spirit wandered into worlds of air, To mingle with his god, and dying share In the last flash of day;—the cold dim glaze Fell on his eye, but yet he oft would bear A fond look to the cloud that drank the rays, And then he calmly died, as one who only pays CXII. Devotion on his pillow, ere he draw His curtain round, and close his eye in sleep; That fond idolater in dying saw, As the day sank in glory in the deep, That rolled in gilt waves o'er it with the sweep Of a far-flashing brightness, there his eye Beheld his god enshrined;—his soul could leap, At such a calm and holy hour, to lie Serenely on his couch, and with his loved lord die. CXIII. Centre of light and energy! thy way Is through the unknown void; thou hast thy throne, Morning, and evening, and at noon of day, Far in the blue, untended and alone; Ere the first-wakened airs of earth had blown, On thou didst march, triumphant in thy light; Then thou didst send thy glance, which still hath flown Wide through the never-ending worlds of night, And yet thy full orb burns with flash as keen and bright. CXIV. We call thee Lord of day,—and thou dost give To Earth the fire that animates her crust, And wakens all the forms that move and live, From the fine viewless mould, which lurks in dust, To him who looks to heaven, and on his bust Bears stamped the seal of God, who gathers there Lines of deep thought, high feeling, daring trust In his own centred powers, who aims to share In all his soul can frame of wide and great and fair. CXV. Thy path is high in heaven;—we cannot gaze On the intense of light that girds thy car; There is a crown of glory in thy rays, Which bear thy pure divinity afar, To mingle with the equal light of star, For thou, so vast to us, art in the whole One of the sparks of night, that fire the air, And as around thy centre planets roll, So thou too hast thy path around the central soul. CXVI. I am no fond idolater to thee, One of the countless multitude who burn, As lamps, around the one Eternity, In whose contending forces systems turn Their circles round that seat of life, the urn Where all must sleep, if matter ever dies:— Sight fails me here, but fancy can discern, With the wide glance of her all-seeing eyes, Where, in the heart of worlds, the ruling Spirit lies. CXVII. And thou too hast thy world, and unto thee We are as nothing;—thou goest forth alone, And movest through the wide aerial sea, Glad as a conqueror resting on his throne From a new victory, where he late had shown Wider his power to nations;—so thy light Comes with new pomp, as if thy strength had grown With each revolving day, or thou at night Had lit again thy fires, and thus renewed thy might. CXVIII. Age o'er thee has no power;—thou bringest the same Light to renew the morning, as when first, If not eternal, thou, with front of flame, On the dark face of earth in glory burst, And warmed the seas, and in their bosom nursed The earliest things of life, the worm and shell; Till through the sinking ocean mountains pierced, And then came forth the land whereon we dwell, Reared like a magic fane above the watery swell. CXIX. And there thy searching heat awoke the seeds Of all that gives a charm to earth, and lends An energy to nature; all that feeds On the rich mould, and then in bearing bends Its fruit again to earth, wherein it blends The last and first of life; of all who bear Their forms in motion, where the spirit tends Instinctive, in their common good to share, Which lies in things that breathe, or late were living there. CXX. They live in thee; without thee all were dead And dark, no beam had lighted on the waste, But one eternal night around had spread Funereal gloom, and coldly thus defaced This Eden, which thy fairy hand had graced With such uncounted beauty;—all that blows In the fresh air of Spring, and growing braced Its form to manhood, when it stands and glows In the full-tempered beam, that gladdens as it goes. CXXI. Thou lookest on the Earth, and then it smiles; Thy light is hid, and all things droop and mourn; Laughs the wide sea around her budding isles, When thro' their heaven thy changing car is borne; Thou wheel'st away thy flight, the woods are shorn Of all their waving locks, and storms awake; All that was once so beautiful is torn By the wild winds which plough the lonely lake, And in their maddening rush the crested mountains shake. CXXII. The Earth lies buried in a shroud of snow; Life lingers, and would die, but thy return Gives to their gladdened hearts an overflow Of all the power that brooded in the urn Of their chilled frames, and then they proudly spurn All bands that would confine, and give to air Hues, fragrance, shapes of beauty, till they burn, When on a dewy morn thou dartest there Rich waves of gold, to wreathe with fairer light the fair. CXXIII. The vales are thine; and when the touch of Spring Thrills them, and gives them gladness, in thy light They glitter, as the glancing swallow's wing Dashes the water in his winding flight, And leaves behind a wave, that crinkles bright, And widens outward to the pebbled shore;— The vales are thine, and when they wake from night, The dews, that bend the grass tips, twinkling o'er Their soft and oozy beds, look upward and adore. CXXIV. The hills are thine: they catch thy newest beam, And gladden in thy parting, where the wood Flames out in every leaf, and drinks the stream That flows from out thy fulness, as a flood Bursts from an unknown land, and rolls the food Of nations in its waters,—so thy rays Flow and give brighter tints than ever bud, When a clear sheet of ice reflects a blaze Of many twinkling gems, as every glossed bough plays. CXXV. Thine are the mountains, where they purely lift Snows that have never wasted, in a sky Which hath no stain; below the storm may drift Its darkness, and the thunder-gust roar by, Aloft in thy eternal smile they lie Dazzling but cold; thy farewell glance looks there, And when below thy hues of beauty die, Girt round them as a rosy belt, they bear Into the high, dark vault a brow that still is fair. CXXVI. The clouds are thine, and all their magic hues Are pencilled by thee; when thou bendest low, Or comest in thy strength, thy hand imbues Their waving fold with such a perfect glow Of all pure tints, the fairy pictures throw Shame on the proudest art,—the tender stain Hung round the verge of heaven, that as a bow Girds the wide world, and in their blended chain All tints to the deep gold, that flashes in thy train,— CXXVII. These are thy trophies, and thou bend'st thy arch, The sign of triumph, in a seven-fold twine, Where the spent storm is hasting on its march; And there the glories of thy light combine, And form with perfect curve a lifted line, Striding the earth and air;—man looks and tells How Peace and Mercy in its beauty shine, And how the heavenly messenger impels Her glad wings on the path, that thus in ether swells. CXXVIII. The ocean is thy vassal; thou dost sway His waves to thy dominion, and they go, Where thou in heaven dost guide them on their way, Rising and falling in eternal flow; Thou lookest on the waters, and they glow, They take them wings and spring aloft in air, And change to clouds, and then, dissolving, throw Their treasures back to earth, and, rushing, tear The mountain and the vale, as proudly on they bear. CXXIX. I too have been upon thy rolling breast, Widest of waters! I have seen thee lie Calm as an infant pillowed in its rest On a fond mother's bosom, when the sky, Not smoother, gave the deep its azure dye, Till a new heaven was arched and glassed below, And then the clouds, that gay in sunset fly, Cast on it such a stain, it kindled so, As in the cheek of youth the living roses grow. CXXX. I too have seen thee on thy surging path, When the night tempest met thee; thou didst dash Thy white arms high in heaven, as if in wrath Threatening the angry sky; thy waves did lash The laboring vessel, and with deadening crash Rush madly forth to scourge its groaning sides; Onward thy billows came to meet and clash In a wild warfare, till the lifted tides Mingled their yesty tops, where the dark storm-cloud rides. CXXXI. In thee, first light, the bounding ocean smiles, When the quick winds uprear it in a swell, That rolls in glittering green around the isles, Where ever-springing fruits and blossoms dwell; O, with a joy no gifted tongue can tell, I hurry o'er the waters, when the sail Swells tensely, and the light keel glances well Over the curling billow, and the gale Comes off from spicy groves to tell its winning tale. CXXXII. The soul is thine; of old thou wert the power Who gave the poet life, and I in thee Feel my heart gladden, at the holy hour When thou art sinking in the silent sea; Or when I climb the height, and wander free In thy meridian glory, for the air Sparkles and burns in thy intensity; I feel thy light within me, and I share In the full glow of soul thy spirit kindles there. CXXXIII. All have their moments, when the world looks dark Behind, around, before them. Some have steeled Their hearts to hope, and put out every spark Faith lends the future,—minds, who will not yield To aught but sense, who lurk beneath a shield That bears unshocked the rudest brunt of fate; They boast of their fixed hardness; they have healed All the heart's wounds by searing; love and hate Have died alike;—unmoved they sit, and sternly wait CXXXIV. Death, which hath lost all terrors, in the cold Stifling of every passion and desire; 'T is the same sound, whether the bell has tolled, Or the flute warbled out the lover's fire; They laugh at Heaven and all who there aspire, Who lowly crouch and bend to fear, they mock; They strive, while they have vigor; when they tire, They sit and muse, like Marius on a rock, And thus in calm, deep thought the Book of Life unlock:— CXXXV. “It came, is gone, whence, whither, none can know: Darkness behind, as deep a gloom before: Wave after wave our generations go Rolling to break upon an unknown shore; Awhile we toss and sparkle, then no more The eye beholds our being; we are fled, And they who moved alone, and they who bore Navies and convoys, soon, as quickly sped, Have vanished in the waste, dark vacuum of the dead. CXXXVI. “Graves tell no tales, but silence dread and deep Broods over them for ever; one long night Wraps all that enter their domain in sleep, On which no day hath ever poured its light; But time, as it advances, still doth write Eternity above their dark repose; Ages have wheeled away in silent flight, Man ever to his long oblivion goes; What if he hath new life? Who hath it only knows. CXXXVII. “We stand the centre of Eternity, Infinity around us: but we cling To the few sands of life, that soon will be Lost in the common mass, when Death shall fling His clay-cold hand athwart us, and shall wring The spirit from our forms; then dust to dust Shall meanly moulder; we shall be a thing For worms to feast on; do we rightly trust We shall be then all mind, or is it a vain lust? CXXXVIII. “So man has questioned, since his being came Forth from the womb of Nature; he has found This dull life for his inner powers too tame, And therefore he hath cast his view around, And wandered far away, beyond the bound Of the seen universe, to find a home For his high soul to dwell in; though the ground Receive the wasted corpse, yet he may roam, On a swift, airy wing, beneath heaven's proudest dome. CXXXIX. “There is a lifting grandeur in the thought; 'Tis the extreme of ecstasy to rear Our now base life above its sordid lot, And kindle in a holy, happy sphere, Where all that is of intellect is near, And all pure feeling finds eternal food: No wonder better souls have rested here Intensely, as the sparrow guards her brood; And it attracts the more, the more it is pursued. CXL. “They live in holy musing,—mind is drawn From all external being,—calm repose In the one chiefest essence, as the dawn Sleeps on the silent valley, when the rose Drips with its seeded dew, that slowly flows From the still leaves, all are so hushed and calm, When the blue flowers of day their leaves unclose, And wake their azure eyes, and breathe their balm, And the green linnet sucks the honey of the palm, CXLI. “Whose broad leaves hang unruffled by the sway Of the cool air, that from the ocean steals With breath so faint, that scarce the silk-tufts play Round the green cane, when the night beauty seals Her golden eye in slumber, but reveals In tender lines of light the fringed lid; When all that hath a life in silence feels The moving of that Power, whose ways are hid Deep in the core of things, unresting, and amid CXLII. “Myriads of viewless instruments, the springs By which the eternal round of life goes on, Whose sleep is in the tomb, when spirit flings Its faded slough aside, again to run In a fresh-glowing spoil, that gives the sun Its light in burnished beauty. Do we fly, Thus parted, Earth for ever? or does one Take from another life, wherewith to ply Awhile on gladdened wings, and then grow old and die? CXLIII. “Nature is one eternal circle: Life Floats through the void, and is attracted, where The elements, in their collected strife, From Chaos raise a world in order fair, To float through space, and on its bosom bear Forms, that are fashioned with unnumbered wheels, To walk, or swim, or on the buoyant air Float in the calm of motion;—Life there steals, And finds its home prepared; it enters, Matter feels, CXLIV. “And all awakes to energy; the blood Courses the winding arteries, which convey Spirit and heat in its air-kindled flood, And send to all, the atoms which array The form in rounded beauty, and their play Paints on the new-born cheek the one full rose, Which is the flower of love; we all obey, Uncheated of our due, the charm, that glows, And then turns sweetly pale, as passion ebbs and flows. CXLV. “Above the temple, where the Godhead sits, Reason, the Deity and guide of man, In the most lofty seat, as well befits The Power whose sacred office is to span All that is working round us, or that can Meet us to please, to harm us, or destroy; Who hath his band of feelings, who may scan All that would seek an entrance; who, as joy Draws or pain frights, seeks, shuns, what charm us or annoy. CXLVI. “There sits the Power upon his higher throne, In a fair palace wrought, when life at first In the grand form, where mind alone is shown, The elements of thought and feeling nurst From the blank infant state, till Genius burst All earthly barriers, and aspired to Heaven;— He sought to grasp its fire, and he was curst By his own daring; now by fancy driven, The victim of belief, he finds a longing given CXLVII. “To dwell with angels, and to fashion dreams Of glory, goodness, perfect mind, pure love, Consummate beauty, in whose gladdening beams We seem exalted to a sense above The common life, that chills us; but we prove, In all this ecstasy, the torturing fire Of a keen thirst, whose fountain doth remove Farther, the more we seek it;—such desire Burns the lost wretch, who finds, each step, the desert drier. CXLVIII. “Man, in the temperate use of all his powers, Is happy: with the simple fruit and stream, Labor and rest in their alternate hours, His life is golden, as fond poets dream Of the first age, the Paradise, the theme Where the rapt spirit gladdens, and runs wild Through citron shades, whose fruitage woos the beam, To harden in its rind, through all that smiled In the Elysian isles, where air was ever mild, CXLIX. “Brushing the light leaves on its jocund way, Borne from the breast of ocean without cloud, Save such light streaks as give the setting day Its gilded glory, where the year was bowed With an eternal harvest, in whose shroud Earth seemed a heaven for gods, not home for men; They dreamed of all these phantoms, and were proud Of their creations, but cold winter then Shut them to gnaw their hearts, and grovel in their den. CL. “Rapture is not the aim of man; in flowers The serpent hides his venom, and the sting Of the dread insect lurks in fairest bowers; We were not made to wander on the wing, But if we would be happy, we must bring Our buoyed hearts to a plain and simple school; We may, as the wild-vines their tendrils fling, And waste their barren life, o'erleap all rule, And grasp all light, till age our fruitless ardor cool. CLI. “We would be gods, and we would know all things, And therefore we know nothing well; our thought Would lift itself upon an eagle's wings, And speed through all that Deity hath wrought And fashioned by his fiat, until naught Should be untravelled; but the aspiring flame Consumes the active mind, and all it sought Becomes its torment, for the breath of fame, Like a Sirocco's blast, will sear and scorch our frame. CLII. “We seek the fountain-head, whence Genius flowed Pure from the breast of Nature, where her stream Was sparkling as the crystal, and it showed The bright reflection of the solar beam, Which from the Sun of mind, the high supreme Of moral grace and beauty, and the throne Of majesty unbounded, took its theme, And in the Muse's morning splendor shone, As in the dawn of light some snow-capped mountain's cone: CLIII. “And we go down the stream of ages, borne Through cultured fields and deserts, and we take All that is poured from Plenty's brimming horn Of mind's collected treasures; there we slake Our growing thirst, and thus by quenching make Burning and wasting our intense desire; We gather burdens, till our spirits ache Beneath the weight of our attainments; higher, Even on the grave's close brink, our mounting souls aspire: CLIV. “And then Death comes, which we have hurried on, By our own longing to escape it; still Hope points the temple we had almost won, Its Doric columns crown the lifted hill, And the departed great its porches fill, And all the springs of Truth at last unlock; Onward we leap to join them, with a will That dies in effort;—so from the doomed rock Prometheus saw the sea roll near, his torture's mock. CLV. “We are the slaves of Nature; sun and cloud Brighten and darken,—cold and heat compel The spirit to their rule; we may be proud That we are lords of earth, and greatly tell How elements, obedient to the spell Of our high reason, follow where we go: 'T is a vain pride; for Glory's upward swell, Lifting its tides, like oceans in their flow, Finds in the meanest check full oft its overthrow. CLVI. “A breath may quell the tempest of a soul, Whose gusts blow o'er a continent, and pour Madness through nations; who, as wild seas roll, When wind and earthquake dash them on the shore, To bury thousands in their rush and roar, Where ages had been calm and happy, send One host to sweep a feebler host before Its brute and causeless rage,—that life may end By the dark, stagnant air, whose poison doth defend CLVII. “With a securer bulwark than the rock Crowned with its iron jaws of death, which speak Defiance to the invading wave, and mock All, who, in their insatiate longing, seek Wider and richer regions, where to wreak The lust of a false greatness: in his snows The Switzer finds his safeguard; winds are bleak, And earth is barren, but his bosom shows How hard and firmly nerved to bear and to oppose: CLVIII. “And in his damp, close woods the Carib dwells Free, for the pestilence for ever spreads Its purple folds around him, till it swells Dire as a Hydra with its hundred heads; Where snakes and reptiles batten in their beds, And round the boughs their bloated circles twine; Where the dull air its fatal influence sheds In one eternal mist,—no pure beams shine, But all that sleeps below is rayless as the mine. CLIX. “Man would be free, but is his own worst slave; His tyrant is his appetite; he lives Calmly in bondage, if he thus can save The lust he long hath cherished; then he gives His birthright to the pander, and believes He hath his surest safety in that power; He rests in quiet sloth; he never grieves For the high glories of that ancient hour, When Liberty sprang forth, and fiercely claimed her dower. CLX. “Base passions are our lords; and thus we bend So silently to those who let us feed On the rank garbage of low joys; we send Rarely, if ever, to the hopes that breed Strength in the heart, and give the mind the speed Of a young courser, on its upward way; The strong and lofty love the daring deed,— Free in their own wide circuit, they obey No power but their own might,—the weak too are their prey. CLXI. “Weakness is vice: man first was bold and strong, Prompt to repel all force, to spurn all rule; He felt his wants, he knew his rights; that throng Of prurient, pampered appetites, which fool The soul of its true being, in the school Of reeking cities taught, he had not known; And therefore he was not the flatterer's tool, Who gives the cup of Circe, but alone He walked erect, a god, and made the earth his own. CLXII. “We tell of meekness,—'t is the very curse Of our degraded nature; we are driven Close in a crowd, where all mean feelings nurse Their blackness, and the feebler thus in Heaven Look for the help that here they find not given, And patiently submit to those who crush; Fetters so galling had been sternly riven By the first upward race; they would not hush Wild nature in their hearts, but spend it in the rush CLXIII. “Of a determined will; though now firm laws Rear iron walls to hem us darkly in, We can be just, and ever in the cause Of the first liberty speak in the din Of prating slaves, who strive, and only win New shackles by their toil; the few will hate The tyrant, and be nobly free within; They live in their own world; the mean will wait Fawning around a lord;—such is the doom of fate. CLXIV. “It is our pride to conquer Nature:—Mind Is an internal force, that oft can sway Things to its great dominion; 't is designed As the one balance, which at least can stay Awhile the haste of causes, which convey All in their downward flood, to where they mix Again in that great furnace, where the play Of first attractions ever will unfix The binding links of life, and send us o'er the Styx, CLXV. “To wander through ten thousand changes, where All first is gross and hateful, till we rise From the rank, putrid heap, to spread in air New forms, that veil at first their energies; But as the tireless wing of Being flies, Hasting for ever onward, they grow pure, And spread new beauty to the admiring eyes Of the pleased Earth, and silently allure To taste their fleeting charms, too lovely to endure. CLXVI. “Why was the sense of beauty lent to man, The feeling of fine forms, the taste of soul, That speaks from eye and lip, and thus will fan Love in the young beholder? Why the whole Waste of creation sweetly can control The fixed heart to devotion? Why hath Night So many golden eyes? Why is the roll Of Nature so accordant, when a blight Withers our very lives, and poisons all delight? CLXVII. “Why are we not like Nature, ever new, Freshening with every season? It is pain To gaze, when sick and wasted, on the blue Arching as purely o'er us, and the stain Of the curled clouds that gather in the train Which the low Sun makes glorious with his smile: To see the light Spring weave her rosy chain, And sow her pearls, no longer can beguile, When age and want and sin our sinking hearts defile. CLXVIII. “Youth is the season when we must enjoy, If we would know the sweets of life; the mind Is then pure feeling, for no base alloy Of gain hath blended with the ore refined By the wise hand of Nature, who designed The beautiful years to be alone the time When we can fondly love, and loving find In the adored the same glad passion chime, As if two spirits met in one most tuneful rhyme. CLXIX. “O, there are eyes that have a language!—sweet Comes their soft music round us, till the air Is one intensest melody;—we beat Through every pulse, as if a spring were there To buoy us into upper worlds, and bear Our fond hearts with linked arms, on whitest wings, To a far island, where we two may share Eternal looks, such as the live eye flings, When it collects all fire, and as it blesses, stings. CLXX. “O, could we stop at this glad hour the wheels Of Time, and make this point Eternity! Could check that onward flight, which ever steals Hues, forms, and soul, as the twined colors flee, Which are above the sevenfold Harmony, Whose perfect concord meets in the soft light That sits upon a wave of clouds,—a sea Of rolling vapor, pearled and purely white, That as a curtain hangs the pale-lit throne of Night: CLXXI. O, could we dwell in rapture thus for ever, Hearts burning with a high, empyreal flame, Whose blended cones no reckless storm could sever, But they should tremble upward till the same Fine point of centred heat should ever aim Higher and higher to the perfect glow; As Dante saw from that celestial dame, Once loved, now worshipped, Heaven's own splendors flow, And gather in her smile, that looked so calm below. CLXXII. “It is not in us; we were fashioned here For a more tranquil feeling, such as home Sheds on two hearts, whose true and lasting sphere Is round the holy hearth; hearts do not roam When they are pledged by the young shoots, that come, Like the green root-twigs, sweetly to renew Our life in their dear lives, which are the sum Of all our after being, where we view Heaven, as the soul's fond smile those rose-lips trembles through. CLXXIII. “O, had I one on whom to fix my heart, To sit beside me when my thoughts are sad, And with her tender playfulness impart Some of her pure joy to me, in whose glad, Up-gazing eyes the love that once I had Might find its lesser image formed complete In all its mellow mildness! We grow mad In dwelling on ideal woes,—we meet Those loved looks in their smile, and mind regains its seat. CLXXIV. “And as those blue eyes on the canvas throw Their watery glances to me, where the tear Seems gathering to a starry drop, to flow Down the soft damask of her cheek, I hear From her moved lips a voice salute my ear, That was so kind and so confiding; pain, Which once did throb within me, now doth veer To a calm stillness; the delirious brain Seems by cool drops renewed to life's young bliss again. CLXXV. “And I would then that pictured form could talk Of hours that once were happy, in the round Of thought still growing, as at each new walk With deeper hue the early bud is found, Till it unfold its leaves, and scatter round Its purest incense;—so our life steals by, Catching new loves and hopes, which, closely wound With every blended thought and wish, will try The heart to its last throb, when loved ones leave or die. CLXXVI. “But there is one affection, which no stain Of earth can ever darken, when two find, The softer and the manlier, that a chain Of kindred taste hath fastened mind to mind;— 'T is an attraction from all sense refined, Not purer shone the sky-born vestal fire; The good can only know it; 't is not blind, As love is, unto baseness; its desire Is, but with hands intwined, to lift our being higher. CLXXVII. “'T is life the twine of hearts from infancy Beneath the same roof, who have kindly shown All the fond aids of childhood;—such as we see In minds, that have one sympathy alone, That answer to each other, as the tone Of woman's voice to the deep sounds that flow From the fit organ-tubes more grandly blown; With a dissolving concord blended so, On through the waste of life those happy spirits go. CLXXVIII. “Life is to them in its revolving years One round of fragrance, one parterre of flowers: There is a very blessing in their tears; They are as to the earth the first spring showers, When, wakened by the music of the hours, All loose their wintry bonds, and leap in air, When up the mountain, which a forest towers, The busy hands of life their colors bear, Darkening the yellow tint, till one deep green is there. CLXXIX. “There is a very blessing in their tears; Their fountain is in purity, they well In a clean heart, whose fondness more endears Than all the forms and blended tints that dwell On a first master's canvas, and compel Worship unto that miracle of skill, Which can at once create, as with a spell, On the blank sheet, such things of life as fill The gazer with mute awe, and bend the sterner will. CLXXX. “There is a very blessing in their tears, For while they flow in happiness, they heal Wounds that bleed deep in other hearts,—Grief hears, With a sweet sense of gladness, tones that feel The sorrow they would comfort; we may steel, In our despair, our hearts to all who lend Kindness to those who suffer; but the seal Of our shut tears is broken, when a friend Weeps with us all our woes, and then our sorrows end. CLXXXI. “And we weep on and smile; the cloud gives way, And a new light comes trembling through its shade; We weep till all our grief is gone, and day Again is pure above us;—thus we aid One in another's evils, which were made Partly to bind more feelingly the chain, That links existence;—we are doubly paid By our own calm from tears, and by the pain Which we have gently healed, and made it bliss again. CLXXXII. “I turn me back, and find a barren waste, Joyless and rayless; a few spots are there, Where briefly it was granted me to taste The tenderness of youthful love, and share In the fond, mutual sympathy, the care Of those on whom our full affections rest: I dreamed, or it was real; but in air The charm was broken; it was mine to test With a long pang how dark and cold the rifled breast. CLXXXIII. “There was a madness in the feeling; fire Seemed to rush through my whirling brain; one stream Bathed it in torture: thought could never tire In painting all that I could shape or dream Of years of mingled joy, till one supreme And perfect sense of glory filled me: light Was in my life—a moment; then the beam Sunk, and a sudden rush of tenfold night Chilled me to my heart's core; all being seemed one blight. CLXXXIV. “And then that deep intensity of pain;— I could have pressed my forehead with the weight Of a whole world, and yet my throbbing brain Bounded beneath my strained hand: all seemed hate And leering scorn around me, tyrant fate Methought had stamped me for eternal woe; There was no cool, soft dew shed to abate The fever of despair;—tears could not flow, But with another's tears, and then I melted so, CLXXXV. “As the doomed wretch, who on the scaffold hears Pardon:—at first he gazes wildly round, And mocks the offer; hope is lost in fears, But as he drinks renewed the silver sound, With such interest joy his heart-strings bound, It is too keen, too deadening:—tears first start Few to his swimming eyes, but he has found Freshness in those scant drops, and then his heart Flows, and his melting frame in every gush takes part. CLXXXVI. “I wept and I was calm; as when at night, After a stormy day, the sky turns clear, And all the world of stars are doubly bright, As the cloud sails away, and the wide sphere Swells darkly pure behind it, till it near The orb that rules the still hours, then its fold Whitens and shines impearled, and then we hear The cock crow, as the silver planet, rolled On the unshaded heaven, makes all things bright, but cold. CLXXXVII. “The earth, that sleeps below in silence, seems Sprinkled with light, for each clear drop of rain, That bends the leaves, and grass, and closed flowers, teems With her mild lustre;—now she casts a stain On the white clouds behind her, not in vain, Bending athwart their curls the breded bow; And as the north-wind whispers o'er the plain, The drops, that fell with such a silent flow, Harden to fretted frost, and whiten all below. CLXXXVIII. “It is one land of loveliness;—but chill Comes the pale landscape o'er me;—not a tread Disturbs the calm;—the lone tree on the hill Waves in its frosted foliage;—fountains fed From earth's warm bosom, as they kiss it, shed A fresh green o'er the meadow-grass, alone Living amid a world that lies as dead In a pale, corpse-like beauty, while a zone Of a most tender tint round all that is seems thrown. CLXXXIX. “Such was the calm that brooded o'er my heart, Silent but cold;—I wondered, and I grew Tranquil, though but a moment; as a dart Leaps on the lurking deer, who wildly flew, Seeking the woodland covert, as they blew The maddening horn behind him, so there came, Through my hot brain, to madden me anew, The same wild thoughts, which soon were blown to flame, Till one convulsive throb ran quivering through my frame. CXC. “And then I thought of death, I sternly rushed To the steep brink, and eyed the depth below: I stood poised for the plunge; my forehead, flushed With the hot pain within me, seemed to glow On the cool wave;—with a last parting throe I yielded up my being, but a thought Checked me,—I might not perish. Some sure blow, That would end all at once,—such death I sought, To wither in one breath, then go where all is naught. CXCI. “Again I steeled me, and the flashing tip Of a sharp dagger met my bounding breast; It seemed with drops of living blood to drip; Already on the seat of life 't was prest, And I was sinking to eternal rest, When a loud voice seemed yelling, ‘Madman, stay! Bear with a sterner will the stern behest Of fate.’ I threw the shining dirk away, And with a deep, wild groan I hasted to obey. CXCII. “My heart seemed hardened from that very hour,— Feeling was deadened in it,—smiles and tears Were gone for ever,—friendship had no power To give me comfort,—all that so endears In the fair face of woman, hopes and fears That have in her their fountain, all had fled; But life had grown eternal, countless years At once had flown, a wider being spread, Dark, silent, dim, around,—I wandered with the dead. CXCIII. “And coldly I live on, and will live on, Till life hath ceased to torture, and the grave Hides me from man, and that long home is won Which welcomes us to quench us, or to save From all that sinks us here. O, I could brave Hell and its fires, if with it strength would grow. There is no pain like weakness;—Justice gave No keener rack than this, to live and know, Weak, scorned, that our own hand had wrought our overthrow. CXCIV. “Well, let the world pass on; I stand unmoved In all its uproar,—all it hath of good Is now turned poison,—those I fondly loved Have died, or hate me;—as the tempter stood In Eden, nursing in his heart a brood Of all dark passions, so I look on life; I find no charm without, my only food Of thought is in the keen and quenchless strife,— I wrestle with despair, where all of ill is rife. CXCV. “But evil is my good;—I cannot turn Back to renew the freshness of young days. Talk not to me of penitence,—I spurn The weakness of the stooping wretch, who pays Awe to the hand that crushes him, and lays The weight of such existence on his soul; I asked not to have being, nor to raise My life from out the brute and senseless whole, Which ever sleeps the same, though years and ages roll. CXCVI. “We must submit or die:—If all would end With the last twinkling of this lamp,—why, well; I could bear on; but thought will sometimes send Questions across the dark, dread gulf, where dwell All wild and formless visions,—'t is the hell That kindles with its fires the doubting brain; It may be,—and those few short words will tell Racks to the lingering heart, that longs in vain To find some calm retreat to quell its raging pain. CXCVII. “There is, they say, a bending form of love, Who spreads his dove-wings over us, and bears The wearied in his gentle arms above All earth has to assail us, sorrows, cares, Toil and disease and want, till cool, sweet airs Breathe odors from the never-fading flowers That grow in Heaven, where peace eternal wears The same undying smile, and, as the hours Steal silently along, descends in balmy showers. CXCVIII. “'T is a fond fancy;—some may find it sweet, Full of all happy visions,—life will seem Bliss in their upward longings,—there they meet All their once loved ones heightened;—such a dream Heals many a broken heart, and then they deem All is one light around them: let them bend Deep o'er their long devotion,—let the theme Of all their words be, of the one Great Friend, Who saves them from all pain, and bids all sorrows end. CXCIX. “'T is not for me,—I am of sterner mould; I must live on in my own heart, and find Strength to sustain—by thought; my only hold Is on that unbent energy of mind, Which, as the storm beats harder on, will bind Closer its will around it, and endure; Which shuns all concord with its own base kind, Where it for ever totters, but grows pure And firm in solitude, which is its only cure. CC. “I will not look on Nature,—'t is too fair, And hath too much of beauty, when it lies Spread in the sunlight;—we must hate, or share In the same being;—when the clouded skies In one black front of coming tempest rise, And bear their rolling waves in torrents on, Then I can wander forth, and lift my eyes With a wild sense of power,—the hollow moan Of the far mountain-winds hath music in its tone. CCI. “I must make home in darkness,—I can sit Days on the sunward rocks that crown the peak Of a long Alpine wave,—such things befit The soul collected in its might to seek Food in the desert: as the raven's beak Bore life unto the lonely man, so I Feed on the darkest forms, and proudly wreak My wrath on Nature, who hath bent the sky, So glorious and so vast, round such as crawl and die. CCII. “The sense of fair and lofty,—this will wring The form that finds itself in cold decay, Hateful to those we loved, and thus we fling The wooing Beauty from us, and array All in a shroud: we cast all hope away, As a fond thing to cheat the infant; pride Comes where ambition fled, and when the gay And lovely from our dark looks turn aside, Abhorrent and in fear, our part is to deride. CCIII. “We have gone through the dusk of death, and known All the grave hath of horrors; we have seen Each separate form of pain, have heard the groan, And the loud maniac laugh; we too have been Partakers in these torments, and have then Come out to be the scorner, and to wear One broad, cold sneer;—we have no part with men, But like a leering devil we must bear Proud on our up-curled lips the scoff that trembles there. CCIV. “We now can smile, and feel at heart a hell;— 'T is a blue meteor on a cloud, that brings Plague o'er a sleeping earth, and tolls the knell Of a lost land, and scatters from its wings Big drops of venom;—such the smile hate wrings From the crushed heart, that hardened as it bore; So I must live, and look on men as things That are my bane,—so hide in my heart's core The grief I cannot tell, till life's poor dream is o'er. CCV. “Then be my spirit firm: the storm may rush In all its rage around me,—clouds may rend Their gloom in one broad flash, and in one gush Pour their wide deluge o'er me,—earth may send Swarms of all ills and plagues,—they shall not bend My soul from its fixed bearing: here on high, Where the rude rocks and snows eternal lend Bulwarks to my retreat, and the clear sky Lifts over me its roof,—I sternly sit and die.” CCVI. 'T is the wild rage of madness, thus to send Defiance unto Nature, thus to build A wall of scorpions, cherishing a fiend Within a human bosom, sternly willed To be the common foe, and darkly filled With all that form the worst of passions,—hate, Till every warning voice within is stilled, And all is nerved to meet the doom of fate, As if man stood alone without a lord or mate; CCVII. As if these feeble bodies had the power To battle with the elements, to stand Sole, as an oak, to whom the wintry shower And summer dew fall like: no heart is manned, Or fenced in iron, that the icy hand Of want may not subdue it, and compel The boldest daring to its stern command; 'T is the relentless tyrant of a hell, In whose cold, sordid dens the heart turns hard and fell. CCVIII. Man is a very infant, when alone;— The desert, and the forest, and the sea, Lifting its boundless brine, and with a zone Of azure clasping earth,—man cannot be, Lost in their barren silence, firm and free,— Nature will lift her voice, and bend him low; Thirst, hunger, fear, and madness, like the tree Whose dew is death, a chilling shade will throw, Where the heart kindles not with a fond, social glow. CCIX. Then farewell, Solitude! where hate is nursed, And doubt is cherished; I would rend away The links that bind my spirit there, and burst From my dark cell of silence into day, And climb with tireless hand my upward way, Where all who wield the hearts of men have trod; Honor and love are there, and these repay For the dull cares and toils wherein we plod,— They have a spell to charm the slave, who turns the clod. CCX. Why mount the higher track, that leads to fame? Why seek to twine a halo round thy brow? Can the wide echo of a bruited name Stifle the cry of vulgar want, when thou Art in the ruder conflict forced to bow To the hard insolence of common men? Better have dug the earth, or steered the prow, Than gain the heights which few can gain, and then Drudge in the sordid path, where meaner minds have been. CCXI. And wherefore doubt? Belief is doubly dear, When truth has never drawn aside the veil That hides the laws of Nature. All who fear Will find a hope,—one voice can ill avail Amid the cry of thousands,—we must quail Submissive to the common creed, or die, Should fortune waft not with a flattering gale, And send the gilded bark in triumph by;— They can do all, who daze with pomp the vulgar eye. CCXII. My work is ended:—I have gained the shore, Whose flowers are fancy, and whose fruits deceit; And I have furled my sail to try no more The gentle breath of favor, nor to beat With adverse gales, nor where the wild winds meet On the contending waters: youth's quick swell Is sunk to manhood's calm, and now my feet Must take a weary pilgrimage, and tell, On through the waste of age, to all I loved, farewell. THE MIND. Read before the Connecticut Alpha of the Phi Beta Kappa Society, September 13, 1825. Of Mind, and its mysterious agencies, And most of all, its high creative power, In fashioning the elements of things To loftier images than have on earth Or in the sky their home,—that come to us In the still visitation of a dream, Or rise in light before us when we muse, Or at the bidding of the mightier take Fixed residence in fitly-sounding verse, Or on the glowing canvas, or in shapes Hewn from the living rock:—of these, and all That wake in us our better thoughts, and lead The spirit to the enduring and sublime, It is my purpose now to hold awhile Seemly discourse, and with befitting words Clothe the conceptions I have sought to frame. There are, diffused through nature, certain Forms, That ever hold dominion o'er the Mind, And with an awful or a pleasing power Control it to their bidding. Life may change In its perpetual round; Manners may take All fashions and devices, putting on Greater variety of antic shapes, Than Puck or Proteus; but with an eternal And ever-constant unity, they keep Their stations and their aspects. Whether high, Or simply fair, mighty, or only turned To elegant minuteness, still they stand On the wide forehead of the Universe, As undecaying as its suns and stars, As bright, and as divine. The willing soul Bows to them with an adoration pure And unalloyed by aught that can defile Or darken. No mean interest hath a place In the still worship offered up to them, Whether we meet them in the vaulted sky Or the invisible air, or see them round us, Creatures of earth, as we are, but informed With this unquestioned title to command The heart's obedience. Hence in every age Men have been devotees unto their shrine; And they have stood erect, when all beside Went to the ground in ruin; or if fallen In some convulsion, when a starless night Clouded the nations, they have risen again With the first touch of dawn, and as they came Into the light of day, man's orisons Were first to them directed,—all his awe And love and silent wonder planted there, As if they were the centre of his soul, The point to which his passions and desires Bent as unto their lode-star. These are they To which the generous spirit ever turns, When he is kindled by the holy fire From off the eternal altar, and has caught Unwearied longing for the blest abode Of all departed greatness. When he rises To the conception of enduring fame, And has revealed before the keener eye Of his most inward sense the great and fair, The beautiful and lofty,—then his vows Are paid to these alone;—no other power Can claim his high devotion, none can awe His fearless will, nor steal upon his heart With an inviting smile,—his eye is dim, His ear untuned, his every feeling dull To aught beside,—nothing can charm him then, That breathes not this pure essence,—nothing draw His love, nor kindle hope,—the nicest work Of Art without the impress of these forms Can fix no wandering glance,—no linked sounds Of most elaborate music, if they flow not, With ready lapse, from this perpetual fount Of all blest harmony, can soothe his ear Even to a moment's listening;—all to him Is jarring and discordant, if it tell not Of these enduring forms, that have no change. They are but one with Truth;—only that Truth Comes to us with a slow and doubtful step, Measuring the ground she treads on, and for ever Turning her curious eye to see that all Is right behind, and with a keen survey Choosing her onward path. But these, which are Lords of the Heart, as she is of the Mind In its pure reason,—these at once approach, And with their outstretched pennons overshadow The willing soul. We look abroad on earth And heaven,—we see the glories of the day, And night's more tranquil glories,—we look down From some uplifted pinnacle, and gaze On waving woods and ever-varying shapes Of hill and level,—we behold the sea Working in ceaseless undulation, while Its never-wearied voice sends up to Heaven Its one eternal hymn,—we stand and look, Shuddering, down to the gulf, where leaps the river With all its wealth of waves, and through the night Of the profound catch only now and then A flash of foam,—we listen to the sound Of its unwasting din, and feel the earth Shake where we tread,—and as we look, we tremble, And know at once the mighty and the vast That dwell around us. Like the revelation Of centuries and ages yet to come, That in the moment of a hallowed dream Startle the prophet's eye, so the sublime Strikes instant on the heart. 'T is but to look, And all is felt and known,—and he who then Is equal to the burden may be filled With the conceptions of a loftier vision Than poet ever sung, or painter drew, And yet find all his efforts to portray The thoughts that fill him, like the faint endeavor To throw off from his laboring heart the weight Of an oppressive dream. Much has been thrown On living canvas,—much been cast abroad In words of loftiest import,—much been framed By plastic hands to shapes of awe and wonder; But nothing ever bodied out the soul In its most daring flight. The eagle soars not Above the highest clouds; and when at sunset The sky is full of fiery shapes, that lie Filling the half of heaven, there are that catch The sun's last smile, too high for any wing To fly to,—but they are the loveliest And brightest;—so the visions of the soul Are often higher than the boldest leap Of Execution, who with vain attempt Lags far behind the rapid lightning-glance Of quick Conception. Hence there may have been Poets who never framed a show of words From out the busy workings of their brain, And who in solitude and loneliness Communed with all sublimity, and played With every shape of beauty, and yet never Put forth one visible sign to tell the world How much they felt and knew. And some there are Whose minds are like a treasure-house of art, Full of such pictures as an Agnolo Would summon forth in vain,—faces that breathe All passion and all pride, and attitudes All might and force, all loveliness and love; Shrinking from sight, and with beseeching art Kneeling before their fond idolatry; Or shrouded in inherent majesty, And wrapped about with mystery as with clouds, Looking a soul of high command, beneath Portending brows, where terror sits, and scorn Of every meaner thing. Yes, there are minds Who know not even the names of these high arts, And yet have all their elements and powers; The imagination, wonder, love, and awe, Awe silent, deep, and wonder proud and high, And love tender and glowing, and a wealth Of bright creations, richer than the west, When, at the hour of setting, overcast With every shape of air. Then who shall say, That Poetry consists in ordered verse, And Painting in the rules of light and shade, And measured tint, and shapes exact and true? Who would not rather own, these are but aids To give a higher charm to what alone Is all attractive? If the unchanging forms Of greatness or of beauty fill the page Or canvas, little care we, if all art Is centred there. We see them, and we pay Due homage, and in doing this, we own There is one beautiful, and only one, One great, one true. Hence there are bards, who lived So early, that their very lives are fable, Whose rhapsodies and songs have come to us From ages of which history has no record, And yet are read with the same eagerness As when they first were sung. Eternal youth Is round them. Like the never-fading bay, They flourish in a green old age, and go Forward, with step as firm, and brow as high, To the last consummation, as at first They charmed the listening crowd in chieftain's hall, Or after battle in the tented field, Or when at night they sat beneath the moon, The round, full moon, and o'er the Ægean sailed, Keeping due time, with balanced oars, to sounds Of minstrel music. Though a chosen few Alone can read the ancient words, that seem Like magic letters to the common eye; Yet in the humble garb of common prose, Or in the guise of more ambitious verse; Bereft of all their sounding harmony, Or hidden by a load of modern art, Unseemly ornament, and fitted ill To the simplicity of heroic times;— Yet even through all these shadowings, every eye, That hath a natural sense, can see the brightness And beauty Time can never dim or fade. And yet these are, for minds that have a share In that imaginative opulence Which gives a life to all created things, The coldest and the dumbest. Not the crowd, Who keep the gift of nature unperverted, Through all the busy clamorings of want, And all the needful cares of animal life, The toils that comfort and necessity Impose so quickly on us. Therefore they Look not with transport on the enduring forms Of an eternal nature. Not the whole In its unchanging rest commands their eye, But ever shifting circumstance alone Sways them, and therefore what is falsely styled By the great name of Life, the sacred name Of the pure vital Being, calls alone Their hearts to joy. They praise the ready hand That imitates the imitative tricks One from another borrows in the round Of senseless ceremony and idle form; And with their noisy plaudits cheer the voice That gives an echo to the vapid jest Of poor mechanic life, and wakes a laugh Only because it comes upon their blank And stolid dulness, like a farthing candle Lighting a stifled vault. These have their day, And well are they rewarded. What they give, That they receive. They deal in common things,— They tell the vulgar, be they high or low, Just what they are; and for this, they may live As richly vulgar as their wishes claim. Not so the few, who earnestly have sought To seat themselves on the far eminence Where the eternal Geniuses are holding Their intellectual court. Not so with them. Their aim was not to catch the popular air. They did not seek to spread their open wings To such a fickle gale. They took their way Beneath the guidance of a better star, And with the heralding of better sounds Than the cheap clamors of the common voice. They formed their own conceptions, and with toil, Long, earnest toil, they brought their laboring minds To the high level of the fame they loved, And then went boldly on. They were alone In their endeavor. None to cheer them nigh; None to speak favorable words of praise. They charmed their solitude with lofty verse, And made their hours of exile bright with song. They had no comforter, and asked for none; No help, for none they needed. Loneliness Was their best good; it left them to themselves, Kept out all vain intrusion, and around them Spread silently an atmosphere of thought, A Sabbath of devotion, such as never Hallowed the twilight vaults of ancient minster, Or filled with many prayers the hermit's cave. It was the deep devotion of the mind In all its powers, sending itself abroad In search of every fair and blessed thing, And with a winning charm enticing home All to itself. They came at its command, Trooping like summer clouds, when the wide air Is thick with them, and every one is touched By the full noon to a transparent brightness, Like heaps of orient pearl. The kindled eye Ran over them, as lightning sends its flash Instant through all the billows of the storm, And took the fairest, and at once they stood In meet array, as if a temple rose, Graced with the purest lines of Grecian art, At the sweet touch of an Apollo's lyre. But they are gone, and now are of the few, Whose fame goes brightening on from age to age, Taking allowed precedency of all Who in their day were lauded by the crowd, For motley jests, and tales of low intrigue, And such entangled stories as they love, Like riddles, to untie. These lived at ease, Courting and courted; shaping all to suit The ear of such as had the strings of favor At their control; speaking smooth flatteries, And with obsequious readiness commending Their suit of wealth, not fame. The present day Bounded their narrow aim. They cared for naught, So they were wafted swimmingly along The even tide. Opinions, none they sought, But golden; and they recked not if oblivion Seized them and all their deeds, when they had danced Their merry life away, and death had come To close their masquerade, and send them where No laugh could reach them, and no goblet flow. And such has been their fate,—for novelty Is the fantastic sovereign of the train Of their once high admirers. 'T is with them, As with the imps of fortune. When they shine Gaudy and glittering, they are then surrounded By a whole swarm of such as are, like them, The insects of a day; but when they lose The polish of their plumes, and dark adversity Hovers above them, like a boding owl, Scared by the omen, all their summer friends Fly to the shelter of a newer shade. But the true champions of the undying strain, That ever-sounding melody of Heaven, Whose essence is eternally the same,— These, as they had no favor from the world Whose love is change, so they are still above it, And ever mounting to a purer sky, And a less clouded air, a clearer sun Lights them, and fuller emanations flow From their inherent brightness, so that they Kindle with years, and catch from every age Some new reflection of their glory, till Like Deities they ride in the mid-heaven, Commanding worship and forbidding doubt, And with a sure compulsion leading us To look upon them with becoming awe. It were not difficult to say of them, Theirs was the better choice, if all we knew Were this their end. The generous love of fame! There is no higher passion that can fill The laboring breast. It hath a touch of Heaven; And he who owns it is awhile refined From the poor dross of earth, and then he shines In Nature's purest ore. His thoughts are bent From the base aim of mercenary life, And, centred in the goal of his desires, Bear the man upward, till he wears about him The livery of honor, and the weeds Of Mind's nobility, whose seal is stamped In the true mint of Glory. If we knew Only the first warm breathings after fame, The strife to gain the lofty seat they hold, While yet the heart was young, the spirit full Of crowding fancies, and the vigorous arm Ready to do the bidding of the will, And do it bravely,—could we then behold him Wearing his clustering honors with a grace That showed he well deserved them, neither bowed Beneath their weight, nor yet elate with pride, But keeping on his even way, well knowing They were his due, and so were but a part Of his own state,—not as a mumming pageant Worn for a moment's bravery, then cast off, Like borrowed robes,—not as a player's crown, Who struts awhile the King, and then retires To revel with his menial,—but as things Of high concernment, which with gentle bearing He should assume, and with a household thrift Closely retain;—could we then follow him To his recess, and mark his holy musing, The quick and sudden motion of his eye, The working of his eloquent lips, the lines Deep furrowed in his brow, the dexter hand Armed for its toil, the other firmly clasped, As if the earnest purpose of his will Had set its token there,—had we then seen How when his upward glance had caught the light, That falls from Heaven, and the prophetic power Descended on him, how his flying fingers Ran o'er the page, giving to fleeting thoughts A soul and form, and coining words of might, Such as shall ever hold mysterious power Over the listening world;—could we then leap Athwart the desolate gulf, wherein he sank, When the loud burst of curious novelty Had died away,—when all his noblest doings Were as a twice-told tale,—when but to say, This thing is Tasso's, were enough to damn it, And call from some low scribbler high remarks, How he had fallen away,—how he had then Lost his first fire and finish,—lost the beauty And all the sweetness of his earlier strains,— How, when he scorned to be the drudge of princes, And do their bidding for a scanty dole, When he preferred to follow out the path He had begun so nobly, to the toil That breaks the spirit, and unmans the heart, By which some great man sought to bind him down To be his client and his slave, and when He found for this, and all that he had shed Of light around his country's name, neglect And bitterer taunts, and false upbraidings, telling How he had thrown aside that good the state And people pressed upon him, and had chosen To wander forth in povery, and beg His way from door to door, casting dishonor On the high art he practised, and despite On those who patiently, with kind intent, Sought to befriend him warmly, but in vain,— How, with a spirit that disdained to tell His sorrows, or repel the insolent falsehoods A cold world loaded him withal, and choosing Rather to keep the freedom of his thoughts, Than live a gilded bondsman, he retired Silently to an unobserved retreat, And there with lean and chilling poverty Wrestled his way to death;—could we o'erleap That interval of woe, and see him now In his confirmed regality, the monarch Of a whole host of worthies, like the star Of Jove, who shows his golden front in heaven First of the midnight train,—O, we would proudly Pronounce his choice the happiest, and our yearnings Would be to live and die and rule like him. But these are only men. The glowing mind Rich in unborrowed light,—the feeling heart, Whose strings are moved by every breath of hope And joy and fear,—the spirit, whose aspirings Are after loftiest fame,—the vast desires For knowledge and for power,—these cannot save The man, who bears them deep within himself, From the assaults of fortune. He has need, Like other men, of comfort and of friends, And most of all,—of love. Such men are made To be most happy, or most miserable, According as their life is turned to hope Or to despair. Open the path of Fame Brightly before them,—let their motives, toils, Rewards, and honors be proportioned to them, Filling the very compass of their powers, And moving onward with an even flow,— None are so happy,—none so full of hope, So earnest in their labors, and so bent To measure life by deeds, and not by years. But set them on a path that they abhor, Where every day tells them more sullenly, They only toil to live, and live to toil,— Where not a ray of hope falls on the dull And joyless round of labor, ever turning In the same fruitless circle,—not a motive To bear them onward,—all their best desires Lavished in bitterest regrets, their powers Buried in cold obstruction, and their strength Wasted in most laborious idleness,— Bind them to such a slavish lot as this, And they will wear their life away in sighs; And if they plunge not in their deep despair In some forbidden gulf of appetite, Seeking to drown the keener sense of wrong In the mere animal and grosser pleasures, They will go sorrowing to an early grave, Or in their madness rush before their time, Unsummoned and unbidden, to their doom. O, would that History had not to tell The wrongs of those that now are reverenced With a religious awe! Who would not change The best estate that wealth or present power Can lavish on the man, whose path has been Ever ascending, and that easily, As if it were a pastime to be great In the world's way,—who would not change it all, To wear the crown of Milton or of Dante, Spenser or Tasso? Who but must allow The meanness of his spirit, and confess He has no feeling of the stirring hope That sends us after fame. And yet 't is painful To think how these were left to pine away A sad old age, and sink into a grave, Unwept, unhonored;—how the Bard of Heaven, Who could not plume his wing for lower flight Than its empyreal towers,—how he decayed, Blind, lonely, poor, the prey of slow disease, And harsh neglect, that eat with keener tooth Into his generous heart,—how he retired Into a dark retreat, that he might shun The sentence of outlawry from a king, Who played the fool and vice upon his throne, Making one half his people fools like him, And on the rest slipping the dogs of war;— How Dante, who with his capacious mind Mastered his age, and held the golden key Of all its wisdom,—he who equally Sang of the bliss of Heaven, the woe of Hell, Groping through the dim caves of Erebus, And winding up the penitential mount, Then soaring through the widening orbs of Heaven Up to the Holiest,—how his native Florence, His dear, ungrateful Florence, thrust him out, And on him closed her ponderous iron doors, Barring to the last moment all return, And with a stern and savage cruelty Chasing him in his exile, till they left No pillow for his head, no dying pillow, Where he might find an instant of repose, Even for his last confession,—how he went Sadly from court to court, seeking a shelter, And, all too bold and free to please the ear Of princes, or command the turbulent crowd, How, after many wanderings, he found 'T was hard to climb another's stair, and bitter To eat another's bread, and leaving this, His only legacy, went to his grave Willingly, as a laborer to his couch, Seeking in death the kindness he had never Found in his home,—thus telling to the world, How desolate and cold the height of fame. Nor can we think with less indignant sorrow, How Tasso, full of tenderness and love, The worshipper of beauty, with a heart Framed to all gentleness and elegance, Whose very words were music, and whose thoughts Were all of hope and joy,—how he was doomed To wear the maniac's chain, and keep account Of the long, lingering hours, and days, and years, Within the narrow compass of his cell, Feeding at times his heart on dreams of love, And visions of bright honor, then upbraiding The dark barbarian who had bound him there, Till reason went indeed, and his high soul Raved in distempered conference with spirits, For even his madness was sublime, and took Its color from the mind that wrought the web Of love and war;—how Spenser sued in vain, At the deaf ears of courtiers, for a boon, Only a pittance of the fair estate Rent from him by the hand of violence,— How, when through long entreaty, which had bowed His better spirit, though it proudly scorned To play the beggar's part, his queen had deigned To give a scanty dole, the unfeeling Burleigh Withheld it, even in his extremity, Withheld it, though it might have given his heart A warmer fire, and helped to smooth for him The passage to the grave;—O, it is painful, To think the very chiefest of the mighty, Heroes in song, as there are those in war,— How they were made the butt and sport of fools, Trampled and crushed by such as would have perished Utterly, had not they asserted thus An impious fame! O, 't is enough to deaden All the fond hopes, the generous desires, The emulous strivings of a heart awake To high ambition, and with early glow Bearing itself up the proud eminence Of intellectual fame! Go on, fond youth, While yet the charm is on thee, and the power Of virtue is unquestioned,—let no thought Of what may come disturb thee,—there is in thee A buoyancy that can awhile sustain The world's cold burden;—let this time of respite Be filled up well, for it may give to thee Fit leisure for attaining such a height As after violence cannot wrench thee from. Know too the high-strung hopes of youth impart An energy and passion to the song That they inspire. There may be nicer art, And a more fitting harmony of sounds, And words of better choice in riper strains; But youth, and, much too often, hope is gone,— At least the hope of greatness, and for this Nothing is left, but what the erring light Of a far-distant glory, or the call Of instant need, can waken. Therefore seize The undoubting moment, and may Heaven befriend thee, And lead thee in the shadow of thy faith, Nor quite desert thee, till the point is gained When thou canst say, a victory is won, That none should scorn. But let us turn aside, From thoughts so little kindred to the scope Of our endeavor,—let us rather choose A path that winds through a fair wilderness, Where all the visible things are leaves and flowers, Green leaves and sunny flowers, and all the air Is ravishing with perfume and with song. So let us to a feast of nectared sweets, The banquet of celestial poesy,— And while the hours permit us to enjoy The blessed light of heaven, let us abroad, And 'mid the graceful garniture of fields Take our delighted way. Nor shall we lack Companions to our revelry in air, Or the still waters. Sounds shall go with us, The voice of the light winds, the liquid lapse Of sunny streams, and haply from the wood A choir of tuneful birds, taking their last, And not ungrateful, farewell of the shades Where they have nestled and have plumed their young In the gay season. If our thoughts incline To a more gentle mood, we shall have friends In the now fading boughs, and withered flowers. They will have meanings for us, such as quell Heart-stirring discontent, and hopes too high For the mind's peace. They tell us of decay, And lead us to the evening of our days, Making life's darker shades familiar to us, In no ungraceful guise, but shedding round them A pensive beauty. Let us then abroad, And in the open theatre of fields And forests let us read the magic lines, Where Spirit stamps on all inferior Being Its essence and its power. There is a life In all things, so a gifted mind hath told In most oracular verse,—and we may well Forgive a heart, that could not brook the sight Of any suffering thing, that he indulged Such fond imaginings as gave to him Companions wheresoe'er he took his way Through hill or valley. He beheld himself Surrounded by a multitude of friends, Who with familiar faces welcomed him In the blank desert; for the changing sky, Cloudless, or overshadowed by all shapes, That grow from air, the sun who walks at noon Untended, and the lesser light that binds Her brow with stars, and all her retinue Of living lamps, had each a voice for him Distinctly audible, though to other ears They had no sound. The mountain, whose bald forehead Looked o'er a host of hills, each compassing A grassy vale, and in each vale a lake Of crystalline waters, and a busy brook Winding in ever-shifting light along The daisy-tufted meadows, now asleep In a smooth-mirrored pool, then all awake To leap the cascade, and go hurriedly Over the sparkling pebbles and bright sands,— The mountain, and its train, had all for him A welcome, and they uttered it with smiles All the long summer, and they told to him In winter such high mysteries, he learned To speak a holier language, and his heart Was ever haunted by a silent power, In whose immediate presence he became Thoughtful and calm;—and so his lofty faith, Which some of poorer spirit have pronounced A madness, was to him the quickening spring Of Poesy, such as we cannot read Without a sense of awe. Then wherefore doubt, At least the gracious tendency of belief So rich in comfort to the lonely mind, That oftentimes finds all access denied To the society of living men, Perchance, of books? The captive, who may catch Glimpses of nature through his dungeon bars, If so persuaded, may have friends with him, The livelong day: and in his darker hours, The silver planet, or the many lights, That keep their watch above him, or the clouds, That lie so tranquilly on the far hills, Will speak a meaning, that hath power to calm His passionate soul, and lead him unto rest Through a fair train of sadly pleasing dreams. With such a gifted spirit, one may read The open leaves of a philosophy, Not reared from cold deduction, but descending, A living spirit, from the purer shrine Of a celestial reason. One is found By slow and lingering search, and then requires Close questioning of minutest circumstance, To know it has the genuine stamp. The other Is in us, as an instinct, where it lives A part of us, we can as ill throw off As bid the vital pulses cease to play, And yet expect to live,—the spirit of life, And hope, and elevation, and eternity,— The fountain of all honor, all desire After a higher and a better state,— An influence so quickening, it imbues All things we see with its own qualities, And therefore Poetry, another name For this innate Philosophy, so often Gives life and body to invisible things, And animates the insensible, diffusing The feelings, passions, tendencies of man, Through the whole range of being. Though on earth, And most of all in living things, as birds And flowers, in things that beautify, and fill The air with harmony, and in the waters, So full of change, so apt to elegance Or power,—so tranquil when they lie at rest, So sportive when they trip it lightly on Their prattling way, and with so terrible And lion-like severity, when roused To break their bonds, and hurry forth to war With winds and storms,—though it find much on earth Suited to its high purpose, yet the sky Is its peculiar home, and most of all, When it is shadowed by a shifting veil Of clouds, like to the curtain of a stage, Beautiful in itself, and yet concealing A more exalted beauty. Shapes of air, Born of the woods and waters, but sublimed Unto a loftier Being! ye alone Are in perpetual change. All other things Seem to have times of rest, but ye are passing With an unwearied flow to newer shapes Grotesque and wild. Ye too have ever been The Poet's treasure-house, where he has gathered A store of metaphors, to deck withal Gentle or mighty themes. I then may dare To call ye from your dwellings, and compel ye To stoop and listen. Who that ever looked Delighted on the full magnificence Of a stored Heaven, when all the painted lights Of morning and of evening are abroad, Or watched the moon dispensing to the wreaths, That round her roll, tinctures of pearl and opal,— Who would not pardon me this invocation To things like clouds? I recollect one night, A winter's night,—the air is clearer then, And all the skyey creatures have a touch Of majesty about them,—there were clouds, So thick, they blotted out the maiden moon, Then in her fulness, and the scanty light That visited the earth came through the rifts Where they had parted. I had gone abroad Upon some fanciful intent, and long Had dallied with the dancing radiance, That now and then flitted from parting clouds Over the snow-fields, when at once it seemed, Just by me, as if Heaven itself were opened, And from the Visible Presence there had come A sudden flash, to herald the approach Of some celestial messenger. I stood As startled as if instantly a bolt Fell smouldering at my feet; but on the moment Turning me whence the emanation flowed, I saw the moon unveiled,—pure, spotless orb She stood in a deep sea of glorious light, Too deep to sound. It seemed as if a wall Were built around her, of the brightest silver, Or rather like the changeful brilliancy Of girasole or opal. It enclosed The semblance of a well, and it meseemed I occupied its depth, and from above The sky looked in, sole tenanted and filled By the round moon. Language were all in vain To give a body to the spectacle That met me then; and yet I will not shrink From my endeavor. First there seemed below A solid mass just touched by the full light, And palely passing into utter darkness On the low-lying clouds;—above it rose Huge piles, like rounded rocks, that glowed intensely With a rich golden blaze; and higher still There lay ten thousand painted heaps of foam, Pure white, and covered over with such rainbows As gem the morning dew; and still above them Shone a whole harvest of such seeded pearl As the swart Genii pour from coral urns, To win the favor of their love,—they seemed All hues, and from them mounted waveringly, Even to the centre, where they seemed to fan Pale Dian's face, long shadowy streamers, floating Like pennons on the newly risen gale, That freshly steals ashore,—they seemed to grow From that deep bed of pearls, like sea-fans waving Over the white sands of the ocean's floor. Glorious creation!—vision of a moment! It vanished, leaving not a rack behind. The clouds closed in, heavy and lowering clouds, And the night thickened, and the flaky snow Began to fall. I then betook myself To my warm hearth, and musing, as I sat, A vision stood before me. Then, methought, A mountain rose above the highest clouds, Far in the distance, like a shadowy thing Floating in thinnest air. The driven snow, Hardened by centuries of frost, beheld, A winter's midnight, on the highest Alps, When the moon holds unquestioned sway in heaven, Were dim to such a brightness as encompassed That shadowy cone. Methought, around it flew A multitude of white-winged cherubim, And well as I could read their looks, so far, Each with a most severe serenity, As if all thought;—and at the highest point There seemed the likeness of a throne, whereon Sat one, whose eye steadily gazed upon The sky above him, reading all there therein, Planet and star, as most familiar letters, His pastime, not his toil;—and by him sat One, who ran over with perpetual glance All visible things, seeking to fashion them To one fixed law; and at his other hand, A spirit of a most sagacious eye, With an internal vision questioning Mind and its thoughts. Methought a voice proclaimed, This is the seat of intellect, where pure And freed from all investment, passion, pride Fancy, and other shades, that might impair The edge of sight,—it holds supremacy Over imagination's highest flight, And the most gifted spirits, who would throw Their rainbow colors round the form of Truth Masking the perfect brightness of the sun With infinite variety of hues Born of the pictured morning. As I gazed With deep intensity, rapt and engulfed In wonder and in awe, as when the martyr Sees the world passing with its clouds away, And from the sapphire walls and crystal gates Of the highest Heaven a wave of light descending, And round it myriads of golden wings, Like the bright margin of the o'erflowing stream At which he drinks and lives,—drinks and awakes To immortality and joy;—or rather Like the strong gaze of Dante, when he saw, Then standing in the loftiest sphere of Heaven, A radiant point, shedding such burning brightness, None but the blessed could behold and live, And therefore veiled by the nine circular choirs Of saints and angels;—or when he beheld, As to that empyrean he ascended, His guide, his own Beatrice, there transformed To a most spiritual shape of light, encircled With such a dazzling glory as the sun Holds at the fullest noon, when the clear air, Dense in its clearness, heightens to the highest The lustre of his beams;—then as I gazed, A most majestic sea of rolling clouds Seemed to surround that throne, and it advanced, And gradually took form, and I beheld, Each on his shadowy car, spirits, who told, By their commanding attitudes, that they Were wont to rule. They occupied three spheres;— The highest, like the throne they now surrounded, Bright, snowy, pure, only the waving folds That circled it were tinted with the hues That fall from diamond prisms, the deepest hues That flow from light. The one below it seemed Woven from silken curls of tenderest blue, Edged with the ruby tints that fill the sky Just as the twilight vanishes. The lowest Was like an awful thunder-cloud, a ridge Of gloomy towers, each with its summit bronzed By an ill-omened flame, and all beneath Purple and dun, down to its lowest depth, Where all was dark,—unmingled darkness, deep As bottomless abyss, or the profound Of central caves. This sea of clouds rolled on, Like the slow tide of lavas, or the storm That hangs for hours on the far-distant hills, Deepening its horrors, till the unclouded sun Is saddened in its shade. The highest sphere Bore on its airy seats four of the train, Who, by their calm serenity, betokened How deep their thoughts,—and therefore they were seated The nearest to the Mind's celestial throne: But by the golden hues that flowed around them, Visions of fancy, such as they had loved, Were shadowed forth. Two were bereft of sight; Their outward eyes were closed, yet not the less They rolled their sightless orbs from earth to heaven With hurried glance, and often fixed them long On the bright sky, as if in holy trance They saw unveiled the very throne of glory, The habitation of the One Supreme, Or the Olympian dwelling of the gods Of the olden time, before the living Sun Descended, and made visible to man The secrets of the Mightiest. I could hear Their voices, full, sonorous, rolling on, Like the perpetual stream of ocean, borne To earth's remotest shores. Yet not alike Their tones,—for one was ever up at heaven, Or, if it took a softer note, as pure As the far echo of an angel's lyre Behind a golden cloud. Less harmony Was in the other song, for now the bolt Seemed suddenly hurled in rattling peals, and then The shrill blast of the trumpet told of war, And then the merry din of flutes and viols Rang, like a festive glee; and then, methought, Loud laughter shook the dome, and last of all Came a low-muttered sound, as if from caves An oracle went forth, or bodiless ghost Gibbered in Hades. Of the other two, One by the broad expansion of his brow, And his high-arching forehead, fair as heaven When air is purged by storms, and by an eye, Now calm, anon in a fine frenzy rolling, Then all dissolved in smiles, and by the light And delicate contour of his lips, revealed, Not only all the majesty of thought, But a quick change of fancy, ever shifting Like clouds before the wind, and with it too A nice observance of the smallest seemings, By which the admiring world have judged him gifted With a seer's eye. The summit where he sat Was fair as bodiless thought; but all below There hung such wealth of folds as round the couch Of royal beauty wave;—and they were part Too rich to gaze on fixedly, while others, Sweeping in cumbrous trains, were dim and dark With horror, and beside them not a few Trailed to the ground like serpent coils, obscenely Dallying with meanest things. The last who held That upper station wore a thoughtful look Of mild humanity, whereon was stamped The seal of power. It seemed his happiness To gaze on loftiest Being, and to read The deep recesses of the human heart, And with a chain of tenderest links to twine Man and his feeblest nature to the height Of all Divinity;—so, though his voice At times might chide the thunder, it resounded So full and loud, it stole at other times Like the low breathings of a happy child In its undreaming sleep, or like the whisper Of summer winds through the still forest boughs, Or like the scarce heard murmur of a brook Kissing its turfy margin. These were they Who rode the proudest; but so much of thought, Busy and deep, and such a silent calmness Of passion filled them, that they bore themselves Meekly in all their honors. In the sphere Beneath them, there were many; but I marked Two of so gentle aspect, they controlled My thoughts to them alone. The one had bound His front with olive, where few scattered leaves Of laurel, and a twine of greenest myrtle, Added their graces. He had sung of peace Cheerfully and most sweetly, and of love With an undying strain; but when he took The warlike trumpet, broken were the sounds That issued, though a few were nobly filled: And soon he laid it by with a sad look, As if he had done violence to himself By so unwelcome effort. Then he sung: “Lay me beneath the hospitable shade Of ancient boughs, and let me dream away, In quiet musing, such a blameless life As marked the golden age; and let me hear The sweet musician of the silent night Pour out her tender heart, till sleep steal on, Opening the ivory door of happy visions, Though all unreal, that the cheated soul, Awhile may wander through Elysium, And quaff oblivion on a couch of flowers.” Thus sang he, while the other listening lay, Propped on his elbow, like a heart-sick girl Reading a tale of visionary grief. There was a dewy softness in his eye, And this awhile threw over him a cloud, That added sweeter beauty to his face, Itself so beautiful, it seemed the shrine Of all the fair and lovely. One would say His being was essential elegance, And nothing came within its charmed sphere But took a brighter hue, and bore around it Something to grace and please. Even majesty Softened itself before him, and became The minister of kindness. He could sing Of war, but it was honorable war, The pride of chivalry, that sunned itself In ladies' eyes; but most of all he loved To tell us of enchanted palaces, Groves, gardens, lakes, and rivers, mingled all, As if not art, but nature, had bestowed them, And yet so tasteful that the hand of art Was surely there, and then to fill their shades With a voluptuous beauty, wantoning In innocent dalliance, for he never dreamed Of aught that was not pure,—his inmost soul Shone as sincerely pure as mountain ice Hewn from the glacier. So he played with beauty, And with enamored fondness followed it Through sorrow to his grave. I turned me then To the lower sphere, and on its fiery towers Saw three, who there sat proudly eminent, Erect and firm. Lines of unwearied thought Were stamped, but an intensity of passion, That burned like a red furnace, gave to them A wild, mysterious glare. Passion had gained The mastery, and meditation served Only to give more fatal energy To what it willed, and, willing, bore at once To the irrevocable act. Such spirits Have made the world turn pale. Passion thus guided Has given us conquerors, who have swept the earth With a consuming fire, and with the blaze Of conflagration dazzled us, and then Left after them a gloom, that sank like night Over the frighted nations. Of the three, One sat with sternly gathered brows, and mused Earnestly, while his swart eye shot beneath A fire that had no rest. He found his pleasure In planting daggers in the naked heart, And one by one drawing them out again, To count the beaded drops, and slowly tell Each agonizing throb. Therefore he took The horrors of the Atridæ for his theme, Where every passion strove for mastery, And every sense of duty went to war With hatred and revenge;—fit theme for one Who loved to put the spirit on the rack, And wrench the instincts of our better nature From all they clung to. He too willingly Sent all his energy into the wrongs Of that mysterious Titan, who bestowed On man the gift of fire, or rather gave A light from heaven,—Knowledge, the blessed light That quickens us, and bids our clay-cold spirits Awake and live,—and for this act of kindness Was seized by the revengeful gods, and bound In adamantine chains,—confined by power Struggling with truth in a captivity That has no end, till one shall stoop from Heaven To bear for him his sufferings, and descend Into the gloomy depths of Tartarus. Strange and mysterious words, and spoken too In a dark age, when nothing yet of light From off a higher altar had descended To fill the idol temple. Boldly, too, This, and full many a startling truth were spoken, That have been, and will yet be, carried on To their fulfilment. Yes, the time will come When all the fetters violence and pride, Hypocrisy and fraud, have twined around The soul of man, shall sever like the flax Before the furnace, and the united voice Of earth proclaim, that every chain is broken, And every spirit free. The time draws nigh When the glad shout shall ring. It will not come At the loud summons of impatient pride, But in the silent going on of things All shall be finished. Let us then await Calmly the close. Another sat with eye Scowling in sickly hate of human things, And now with loftiest aspirations breathing After sublimer worlds, then pouring out Reproach and scorn, and with indignant wrath Cursing the meanness of the baser crowd, Whose touch he felt was bane,—then with a sneer Laughing at folly like a gay buffoon, Seemingly, but a bitterness withal Curled on his lip, and gave a hollow sound Even to his merriest gibes. A fallen spirit Had better filled his place, for so he seemed, Pandering the baser passions, with a voice That might have borne itself among the highest, And long been hailed, for its redeeming power, By all the wise and good. Between the two Sat one, who seemed to rule. His deep sunk eye Burnt with an ominous glare, and on his brow Strong passion worked; and yet at times he raised His look aloft, and then a moment's calmness Stilled it, but soon prevailing nature took Her wonted way. This man had suffered wrong, Foully and cruelly had suffered wrong, And this he had resented, till his mind Lost the kind balance which had lifted him To the calm regions of unruffled thought, And holy musing. His resentment gained Such mastery o'er him, he contrived a web Of most unearthly dreams,—visions of hell And all its horrors,—that he thus might vent His hatred, and deal out a deep damnation On all his foes. Methought he yet looked down Into his gulfs, and saw them writhing there, With a delighted scorn. While thus I gazed, Silent and wondering, from his cloudy seat He moved to meet me, like a messenger Deputed from the spirits there assembled To hold communion with me. He advanced Till he bent over me, and then, meseemed, He stretched his ghostly hand, and with a sign Of mute attention thus addressed me: “Hear Carefully what I utter, and retain it Deep in thy heart of hearts. We are a band Who gave ourselves in life to the high art Of song. For this we left the flowery walks Of pleasure, and forewent the better aims Of wealth and power,—and some of us were doomed To bear the burden of consuming care, And wrestle onward to a welcome grave Through poverty and scorn,—and yet we bore Manfully all our wrongs, and never broke The allegiance we had vowed, but rather chose To leave all the world covets most, and keep The honorable service of the lyre, Whose rich reward is fame. And we have gained it, And thus far we are happy. If thy heart Feel aught of longing to be one of us, Be cautious and considerate, ere thou take The last resolve. If thou canst bear alone Penury and all its evils, and yet worse Malevolence, and all its foul-mouthed brood Of slanderers, and if thou canst brook the scorn And insolence of wealth, the pride of power, The falsehood of the envious, and the coldness Of an ungrateful country,—then go on And conquer. Long and arduous is the way To climb the heights we hold, and thou must bide Many a pitiless storm, and nerve thyself To many a painful struggle. If thy purpose Is fixed, then welcome. We will hover o'er thee, Thy guardian spirits, and thy careful ear May often listen to our friendly voice, After thy earnest toils. We now are with thee;— Thou hast the records we have left behind, And thou canst read them, as we wrote them down, Fresh from the heart,—and this it is to hold Communion with us. Let it not depress thee, That few will bid thee welcome on thy way, For 't is the common lot of all who choose The higher path, and with a generous pride Scorn to consult the popular ear. This land Is freedom's chosen seat, and all may here Live in content and bodily comfort, yet 'T is not the nourishing soil of higher arts, And loftier wisdom. Wherefore else should he, Who, had he lived in Leo's brighter age, Might have commanded princes, by the touch Of a magician's wand, for such it is That gives a living semblance to a sheet Of pictured canvas,—wherefore should he waste His precious time in painting valentines, Or idle shepherds sitting on a bank Beside a glassy pool, and, worst of all, Bringing conceptions only not divine To the scant compass of a parlor piece,— And this to furnish out his daily store, While he is toiling at the mighty task To which he has devoted all his soul And all his riper years,—which, when it comes To the broad light, shall vindicate his fame In front of every foe, and send to ages His name and power,—else wherefore lives he not Rich in the generous gifts of a glad people, As he is rich in thought? There is no feeling Above the common wants and common pleasures Of calm, contented life. So be assured, If thou hast chosen our companionship, Thou shalt have solitude enough to please A hermit, and thy cell may show like his.” THE SUICIDE. 'T was where a granite cliff high-beetling towered Above the billows of the western main, Deep in a grot, by sable yews imbowered, A youth retired to ponder and complain. 'T was near the nightfall of a winter's day, The sun was hid in clouds of dunnest gloom; Before the north-wind rose the whitening spray, And the loud breakers roared the sailor's doom. Dark, sullen, gloomy as the scene around, The soul that harbored in that youthful breast; To him the wild roar was a soothing sound, The only one could hush his woes to rest. His was a soul that once was warm and kind,— That once could love with gentlest, purest flame; So mild, so lovely, was his infant mind, His cheek ne'er reddened with the blush of shame. But never could he brook the frown of pride,— This was the killing stroke that smote his heart; All other wounds of fortune he defied,— This—this to him was death's envenomed dart. He felt himself too good to crouch and bend Before the man whose only boast was birth; O, he would sooner his own bosom rend, Than bow before the haughtiest lord of earth! There was a savage sternness in his breast; No half-way passion could his bosom move, None e'er by him were scorned and then caressed; His was all gloomy hate, or glowing love. Those whom he scorned he passed unheeded by; He never lured a foe with artful wile, But when a friend or lover met his eye, Each word was sweetness and each look a smile. He once could love, but oh! that time was o'er; His heart was now the seat of hate alone; As peaceful—is the wintry tempest's roar, As cheerful—torture's agonizing groan. He would have loved, had not his frozen heart Suspected every form, though e'er so fair; How could he love, when racked by every smart, And all the gloomy horrors of despair? Insult him, he was wilder than the storm; His blood in boiling vengeance through him rushed, And those who thought they trampled on a worm Soon found an adder in the form they crushed. In dissipation he had revelled long, Had known the wildest paths that vice e'er trod; He roamed, seduced by pleasure's siren song, Until he hated man, himself, and God. He hated man, because he thought a foe Smiled in each scene, and lurked in every path; He scorned himself, for he had sunk so low; He hated God, because he feared his wrath. So warm his passions, and so stern his will, So wild, and yet so tender, was his eye, So warped his heart to everything that 's ill, He was not fit to live,—much less to die. The wind that whistled round the gloomy walls, The billows roaring on the rocks below, The trickling drop that freezes as it falls, Seemed warm and cheerful as that child of woe. Oft had I seen this youth pass heedless by, All negligent his dress, and wild his mien; The tear was always starting in his eye, A smile was never in his features seen. With languid air, with eye by sorrow seared, And downcast look, he walked,—then paused awhile, And in the darkness of his gloom he feared To raise his head, lest he should see a smile. So much the victim of despair and fear, He looked more sadly when he heard one speak; And when he saw a smile,—O, then the tear Streamed o'er the furrows of his woe-worn cheek! So wan his cheek, his countenance so pale, He seemed just sinking to an early tomb; So tottering were his steps, his form so frail, A ghost seemed wandering in the cavern's gloom. He walked, then stopped; then started, stopped again; Then raised to Heaven his wild and impious eye; Then gnashed his teeth, as in severest pain, Or feebly groaned, or heaved a long-drawn sigh. With hands in fury clenched, he beat his breast, Then smote his forehead, stamped, and wildly raved; It seemed no soothing hand could give him rest, He seemed too far abandoned to be saved. “Are these the joys of life?” he wildly cried; “Are these the pleasures man enjoys below? The siren voice that said, ‘Be happy,’ lied, It called me not to happiness, but woe. “Life,—'t is a pang that racks us for a while, Then like a bubble bursts and all is o'er; Its highest joys, even woman's lovely smile, To me are gloomy as yon billows' roar. “I'll live no more,—I know the world too well,— I'll trust no longer to its soothing voice;— Let those who choose in pain and sorrow dwell,— Death is my fondest, death my only choice. “Live,—shall I live without the slightest meed, Without one voice to dwell upon my name, With hand too weak to do one noble deed, Or pluck one leaflet from the wreath of fame?— “Live, while consumption, ghastly, gloomy, pale, Even to a shadow wears my form away,— Shrink at the rustling of the gentlest gale, And pine, to dark despondency a prey? “Say, is this life? How trifling, O how vain, To give one struggle for a world like this! How cold, how heavy, pleasure's flowery chain, How sickening every cup of earthly bliss! “I've drained the goblet, and I know how vile, How mean and empty, all terrestrial joys; Reason surveys them with a pitying smile, And stamps with words of lightning, ‘Infant toys.’ “How easy, when depression sinks me low, To leave this world and seek another shore,— Careless if pleasure laugh, or all be woe, If smooth the waves, or loud the billows roar! “How easy, O how trifling, with the steel To pierce a heart that loves no scene below, To wound a breast too callous e'er to feel A pang less cruel than a demon's woe! “Does not the smiling surface of the wave Kindly invite to take my endless sleep? How sweet to rest within a watery grave How soft those slumbers,—that repose how deep! “The death-winged ball can pierce my frenzied brain, The knife can loose the shackles of my soul, An opiate, that can ease my every pain, Smiles, how inviting! in the poisoned bowl. “And thou, sweet drug! canst shed the balmy dew Of sleep eternal o'er my wearied eyes, And give repose, as calm to mortal view As when the infant wrapt in slumber lies. “Still thou art slow, though sure,—ah! can I wait A single moment, ere I sink in death? Perhaps I may lament it when too late, And struggle to regain my fleeting breath. “Give me the knife, the dagger, or the ball;— O, I can take them with a smile serene! Then like a flash of lightning I may fall, And rush at once into the world unseen.” The withered leaves, that decked a beechen bough, Rustled,—he turned and gazed with frozen stare; Such gloom, such horror, settled on his brow, He seemed the very image of despair: “Disturb me not,—there 's naught can give relief; Heaven deigns no soothing comforter to send; There is but one can soothe my gnawing grief, It is the best of earthly good,—a friend. “A friend,—I thought I once had friends,—but no! Friendship, thou cherub! ne'er wert to me given; Friendship is not a flower that blooms below,— If there is friendship it must be in Heaven: “And when I 've seen the pious widow's woe, And viewed no Christian friend or heaven-born fair E'er deign to wipe away the tears that flow, I 've thought even friendship was not real there: “And when no human form on me would roll The glance that soothes, or beam the smiles that bless, My dog, the only solace of my soul, Even bit the hand extended to caress. “What if some female form should deign to smile, And chase away the gloom that clouds my breast? Could I be happy,—could I stay awhile? Yes, woman's smile could make me cheerful,—blest. “The heart that 's tortured with remorse is dead To all the joys that woman's love can give; Affection does not smile where hope is fled; Where conscience frowns, that charmer cannot live. “Can Love, the sweetest cherub, ever deign To live, where doubt, despair, distraction, dwell? Ah, no! this fond idea must be vain, Love in my bosom is a saint in hell. “Let others boast their skill to charm the soul, And proffer pleasure to the expecting eye, To bid the glance with mimic sweetness roll, And heave the bosom with an empty sigh; “Away such base deceivers from my sight! Hide them, ye shades of midnight, from my view! Think you such flatteries can my soul delight? Farewell such love, such hollow friends adieu. “No smooth deceit e'er floated from my tongue, By flattery's wiles these lips of mine ne'er moved; On them—on them this truth has always hung, ‘I ever hated all, and nothing loved.’ “And what if man or woman shun my form. And view a tiger in the gloom I wear? To me their smiles are blacker than the storm; There seems a serpent ever lurking there. “The charms of Vice detained my soul too long: What sounds of sweetness in her love-notes flow! But misery's sigh is in her sweetest song, And in her gayest smile the tear of woe. “The eye that beams so fondly ill conceals Distraction's silent gaze and icy glare; The lip that smiles so sweetly still reveals The paleness, and the quivering of despair. “I drank her cup of promised bliss,—I lay In soft repose on beds of roses flung, There heard her Ariel harp its wind-notes play, And all the siren music of her tongue,— “In slumber soft, I closed my swimming eyes, While sounds ecstatic seemed around to flow: I slept—no more in happiness to rise; I closed my eyes to bliss,—I woke to woe. “Look at my eye, and see the glare of pain; Look at my cheek, it is the hue of death; See there the softness of her flowery chain, There mark the sweetness of her balmy breath. “Shun, shun the road she points to,—death is there; Her sweetest voice is but a funeral knell, Her gayest smile is but the gloom of care, And though she calls to heaven, she leads to hell. “What's earth, what's life, to space, eternity? 'Tis but a flash, a glance, from birth to death; And he who ruled the world would only be Lord of a point,—a creature of a breath. “And what is it to gain a hero's name, Or build one's greatness on the rabble's roar? 'T is but to light a feeble, flickering flame, That shines a moment, and is seen no more. “Once Cæsar gained the summit of renown, For him fame's trumpet blew its loudest peals; But what to him is Glory's shining crown? It heightens but the blackness it reveals. “What is the greatness Science can display, Or from the best-tuned lyre what can we gain? But that the fluttering insect of a day May hum our praise, and all be still again. “What if a Titian's tints, a Rubens' fire, A Raphael's grandeur, o'er my canvas glow? These tints, that fire, that grandeur, soon expire, And melt as quickly as the summer's snow. “Let boastful Wealth his richest stores unfold, And Pride his pomp of ancestry display; A speck of yellow dust is all their gold, An infant's rattle, all their proud array. “What praise to shine in Fashion's brightest ray? What is that fame by fops so dearly sought? 'T is but the mere ephemeron of a day,— 'T is but the very meanest part of naught. “And thou, proud monarch, frowning on thy throne! What is the space between thy power and me? 'T is but to sit above the crowd alone, And lord it o'er a few poor worms like thee. “Ah! when I look on man, and see how low, How vile, has sunk the basely grovelling crowd, I still can scarcely think this child of woe Can have sufficient meanness to be proud. “Depart, Renown! O, hie thee far away! And Fortune, though in all thy splendor drest! O, from this world you 've torn my only stay, And left not even one motive in my breast. “This world has now so dull and gloomy grown, So sickening every sight where'er I range,— 'Mid all life's bustle, I am still so lone, I'd leave it, were it only for a change. “What balm shall heal my wounds, or soothe my woes? How shall I sink to my untimely grave? Shall this sweet opiate lull me to repose, Or shall I plunge beneath the roaring wave? “Come, sweetest draught, I woo thee to my lips With all the fondness of a lover's breast; No thirsty, weary pilgrim fondlier sips The cooling fount, or lays him down to rest. “Come, do thy work, and free my struggling soul, Swift as the lightning, from life's heavy chain: I care not if I reach Heaven's shining goal, Or plunge beneath the waves of endless pain. “You gave me life,—take back the gift you gave, Nor think I 'd thank you for such trash as this; Sweeter to me annihilation's grave, O, sweeter than the highest heaven of bliss! “Roll on the winds your most terrific storm, And shade the skies with more than Egypt's gloom; Then with your vengeful lightnings scathe my form, And hurl me to my never-ending doom. “I've plunged in guilt, till I can plunge no more; I've been to man and God the fellest foe; On me—on me each cup of fury pour, And whelm me in the deepest gulf of woe.” But ere the sun had dipped his orb of light Beneath the wave that swelled along the main, A momentary brilliance met the sight, And shone reflected o'er the watery plain. The trembling lustre glanced upon his eye,— There was a something, neither smile nor tear, A sound, nor comfort's voice, nor sorrow's sigh, Fell scarcely heard upon the listener's ear. “Can there no ray like this of mercy shine, To dissipate my soul's terrific gloom? Is there no beam from Heaven, no light divine, Can gild the path that leads me to my tomb? “Must all within be desolate and sad, Must all seem frowning to the mental sight, When the last sunbeam makes all nature glad, And ushers in with smiles the shades of night? “May I not hope, although dark clouds of woe Hang o'er my soul, and sink it to the grave,— May I not hope for happiness below, That Heaven will smile, and mercy deign to save? “The light is gone, and all is dark again,— So flies the light that shone upon my soul; Night's horrors thicken o'er the heaving main,— So round my heart despair, distraction, roll. “What! shall I catch at hope's illusive gleams, That glance like meteors thro' my frenzied brain? What! shall I trust to fancy's wildering dreams? No! death and ruin welcome once again. “No! I can pierce the grave's tremendous gloom, And through its dunnest shades unfaltering pry, Can read with look unmoved my direst doom, And view the world of woe with heedless eye. “O, you may tell me of the quenchless flame, And gnawing worm that never, never dies, Or read each furious devil name by name,— The hottest hell within my bosom lies. “Is this your kindness,—you who made my soul, And formed it to be sensible of woe, Then bade a world of anguish o'er it roll, And through my veins despair's dark currents flow? “Why was I made for misery alone? Why were my joys but preludes to my pain? Why was my voice but formed to breathe the groan, Or why my tongue but fashioned to complain? “You bade a thousand pleasures round me smile, But mingled poison in their balmy breath; Bade angel forms exert their every wile, To lure me sweetly on to sin and death: “Is this your kindness,—thus to charm my eyes, By what would certainly my soul undo? O, is it not sufficient to chastise? Must you allure me, and then punish too? “O happy prospect! for before my sight Annihilation rises dark and drear: Or to my vision glares hell's murky light, And sighs, and groans, and gnashings, fill my ear. “What clouds around the grave's dark regions roll! I'd give the wealth of worlds to pierce their gloom, And read, imprinted on the eternal scroll, The awful words of flame that mark my doom. “The thoughts of an hereafter wake my fear, And fill my soul with agonizing throes; Methinks some accent whispers in my ear, And tells me, nothing will my pangs compose. “Nothing!—there 's something awful in that sound; O, shall my all be crumbled into dust? Shall mind—shall body rot beneath the ground, Nor soul immortal from my cerement burst? “Nothing!—away, thou phantom, from my brain! Away, thou deadlier fiend than ever rose To rack the doubting soul with hellish pain, Or fill it with a maniac fancy's woes! “Nothing!—unreal shade of all that's ill, Cease, cease thy clamors, nor disturb me more! Hush! let that demon voice of thine be still,— O, hie thee to thy dark Tartarean shore! “What if I pry beyond the yawning grave? Is there a light can point my wildered way? Is there an arm of Mercy stretched to save? O, help that arm, and guide me, genial ray! “I look, but all is darker than the gloom That hung, a sooty mist, o'er Egypt's land; I listen, all is stiller than the tomb; There is no ray,—no Mercy's outstretched hand. “Come, then, each busy devil to my breast, Come every fiend of hell, and nestle there. Rack me,—Religion cannot give me rest; If Mercy will not whisper,—yell, Despair! “My ear is open to thy piercing cry: Pour it,—to every suffering I'm resigned. But hark!—methought I heard an angel fly With downy pinions on the passing wind. “No! 't was an idle fancy,—mock no more, Thou cheating spirit, thou art false though fair; No! 't was the wave of ruin's sullen roar; No! 't was the hollow voice of dark Despair. “Come, grisly Death! and whet thy bloody dart; Come, waft upon the breeze my dying knell; O, misery and woe have filled my heart! O, hell to me is nothing,—nothing 's hell!” He said, and lifted high the poisoned draught; “This gives,” he cried, “my body to the tomb,— To nothing, dreary nothing, it shall waft My soul, or yield it to its endless doom. “A doom that strikes my shuddering soul with dread, And almost drives my purpose from my breast; Speak not those words,—for every hope is fled; In death, in darkness, is my only rest. “Come to my lips,” he spake, with features calm, “Come to my lips, thou cordial of my woes; Pour in my wounded heart thy healing balm, And in eternal sleep my eyelids close. “Come, lovely draught! O, lovelier than the spring! And sweeter than the morning's dewy breath! Come, to my soul oblivion's comforts bring.” He said, and calmly drank the cup of death. When life was weak and faint, his ardent soul Unfolded all the vigor of its powers; Then through the fields of lore he flew, and stole With ceaseless toil, the honey of its flowers. His heart expanded with his growing mind, And love, and charity, and thirst of fame, Unbending worth, ambition unconfined, O, these he wished, his bosom's only aim! O, he would think of these, until the glow Brightened his cheek and kindled up his eye; Then in a rushing flood his thoughts would flow, And lift him to the all-o'erarching sky. And yet his soul was tender;—there was one Who made his heart throb, and his pulses beat; She was his all, his only light, his sun,— Her eye was brightest, and her voice most sweet. She was to him an angel;—he was young, The down of youth had just begun to grow; His eye for ever on her image hung, There would his centring thoughts for ever flow. O love how ill requited!—could a soul, Then soaring to perfection, blend with one Who only thought of transient sport, whose whole Enjoyment ceased below, where his begun? And then his fearfulness and shrinking eye,— She knew her power, and yet she could not know The worth of him who doated;—with a sigh Of grief and wounded pride, he let her go. First love,—with what a deep, strong, fixed impress It prints the yielding heart of childhood! Gone, No other eye the lone, lost soul can bless, Hope then is fled, the feelings are undone. How all unequal were his mind and form! This knew the blinking owls, that shunned his light; To wound his bosom, and to raise the storm He ill could master, seemed their sole delight. Abused, neglected, fatherless, no hand To guide or guard him, left alone to steer His dangerous way,—can youth securely stand, When not a parent, friend, or hope is near? He conquered in intelligence, but those Who felt his strength there, still his weakness knew; They crushed his spirit first, and then, to close Their work, they made him like their grovelling crew. The light of Heaven was gone,—ambition still Lurked with him to the last, but he was blind; And genius struggled on through every ill, But peace and innocence were left behind. Years hurried by,—but what a raging sea Was that young heart!—wild as a steed he ran, Till he was swallowed in misanthropy, And swore eternal enmity to man. And yet he could not hate,—at every look, That told the wounded bosom's throbbing swell, His frame in sympathetic shivering shook, His hand, though raised in wrath, in pity fell. He longed to cast his hateful chains away, He longed to be all virtue, reason, soul; In vain he strove against the headlong sway Of passion,—till its gulf absorbed the whole. 'Mid all his folly, weakness, guilt, one beam Across the darkness of his being shone,— Most dastardly and shameful did he deem To take one mite that was not all his own. She came,—at last the kindred spirit came, The same bright look, the same dissolving eye; Her bosom lit with that ethereal flame, Which warmed him, when in youth his soul was high. Informing and informed, theirs was the pure Delight of blended intellect,—their way Was strewed with reason's choicest pleasures, sure To last with those whom guilt leads not astray. Awhile his spirit kindled,—hope, and love, And friendship, days of peace and joy arose, And lifted all his ardent thoughts above The memory of his follies and his woes. His way had been unequal—now he soared On rushing wings, and now he sunk in night; But then he felt new life around him poured, He aimed to Heaven his strong, untiring flight. 'T was but a moment,—like the dying flash, The soul's last sparkle, ere its lights are fled; Then folly came, his kindling hopes to dash, And hide his spirit with the moral dead. Too late! too late!—thou couldst not call him back, With all thy charms thou couldst not: guilt, despair, So long had dogged him in his wayward track, They quenched the light that once shone brightly there. An outcast, self-condemned, he takes his way, He knows and cares not whither; he can weep No more,—his only wish his head to lay In endless death and everlasting sleep. Ah, who can bear the self-abhorring thought Of time, chance, talent, wasted,—who can think Of friendship, love, fame, science, gone to naught, And not in hopeless desperation sink? Behind are summits, lofty, pure, and bright, Where blow the life-reviving gales of Heaven; Below expand the jaws of deepest night, And there he falls, by power resistless driven. The links that bind to life are torn away; The hope, the assuring hope of better days, Friendship that warms us with a genial ray, And love, that kindles with an ardent blaze. These he has left, and books have lost their charm; The brightest sky is but a veil of gloom; His mind, hand, useless, where can be the harm In drawing to his only couch, the tomb? Ye who abused, neglected, rent, and stained That heart, when pure and tender, come and dwell On these dark ruins, and, by Heaven arraigned, Feel, as you look, the scorpion stings of hell. But no! your cold, black bosoms cannot feel; Amid the rank weeds, flowers can never blow; Your hearts, encrusted in their case of steel, No feelings of remorse or pity know. Yes, you will say, poor, weak, and childish boy, Infirm of purpose, shook by every sigh, A thing of air, a light, fantastic toy,— What reck we if such shadows live or die? But no! my life's blood calls aloud to Heaven, The arm of Justice cannot, will not sleep; A perfect retribution shall be given, And Vengeance on your heads her coals shall heap. Where minds like this are ruined, guilt must be, And where guilt is, remorse will gnaw the soul, And every moment teem with agony, And sleepless thoughts in burning torrents roll. And thou, arch moral-murderer! hear my curse: Go, gorge and wallow in thy priestly sty; Than what thou art, I cannot wish thee worse,— There with thy kindred reptiles crawl and die. THE WRECK. A TALE. 'T was a calm summer evening. On the sea, Spread out a perfect mirror, there was seen, In the blue, hazy distance, one white sail, That caught the eye of hope and love. She came, When her light task was ended, to the brow Of a commanding precipice, that hung Its dark wall o'er the waters. By the staff, On which a flag was hoisted, she sat down In the red sun-light, which, to all below, Gave a deep tincture to the towering cliff, And the loose folds that tremulously waved In the scarce-breathing sea-wind, and the snow Of her own tender paleness. She had caught The sail from the lone cottage of her sire; For she was motherless, and had not known The name of sister; but her heart was bound In the affection of a father's heart, And in the love of one who was not there, But far upon the ocean. She had been Nursed tenderly and fondly; for the hand That reared her in that solitude was full, And might have lived in cities, and have been Courted by the vain crowd, but that he chose The silence of a distant, wild retreat, Which left him to the company of books, And the dear culture of the infant mind, To which his heart was knit by all the links That bind us to the cherished and the young, The gentle and the lovely. He had fled From a harsh world; and on the ocean's brink, And in the bosom of romantic hills, And by the channel of a broken stream, Had sought communion with the beautiful And the sublime of Nature; but he still Nourished the kindest feelings; and in one Who had from him her life, and was the life Of his decaying years, he treasured up All he had ever known of early love And youth's devoted passion. She had grown, In her unstained seclusion, bright and pure As a first opened rose-bud, when it spreads Its pink leaves to the sweetest dawn of May, After a night-shower, which had wet the woods And gardens with the big, round drops that hang Dancing in the fresh breeze, and tremblingly Specking the flowers with light. She too had been Not only shielded from all tint and stain Of the world's evil, that the first clear stream Of feeling in her heart still flowed as clear As when it first ran onward, like a spring That ever comes from the deep-caverned rock Flowing in virgin crystal,—but her mind Was lifted by the guidance of a mind Wrought to habitual greatness, and endued With the true sense of glory. She was taught That happiness was in the tender heart And the waked soul; that the full treasure spread In beauty o'er the ocean and the earth, With change of season, and its ever new And grand or lovely aspect was enough To move the heart to rapture, and supply The food of thought, the never-failing spring Of sweet sensations and unwasting joys. But nature still was in her, and she soon Felt, that the fond affection of her sire, And her loved tasks,—the study of high thoughts, Poured out in sainted volumes, which had been Stamped in the mint of Genius, and had come Unhurt through darkest ages, bright as gems That sparkle, though in dust,—the skilful touch Of instruments of music, and the voice Sweet in its untaught melody, as birds Clear-warbling in the bushes, but attuned To the just flow of harmony,—the hand That woke the forms of pencilled life, and gave Its color to the violet, and its fire To the dark eye, its blushes to the cheek And to the lip its sweetness, or that drew O'er the pure lawn the silken thread, and wove The full-leafed vine, and the luxuriant rose, All petals and vermilion,—or the walk On the rude shore, to hear the rushing waves, Or view the wide sea sleeping,—on the hill To catch the living landscape, and combine The miracles of Nature in one full And deep enchantment,—or to trace the brook Up to its highest fountain in the shade Of a thick tuft of alders, and go down By all its leaps and windings, gathering there The forest roses, and the nameless flowers, That open in the wilderness, and live Awhile in sweetest loveliness, and die Without an eye to watch them, or a heart To gladden in their beauty,—or in that, The fondest to the pure and delicate, The gentle deed of charity, the gift That cheers the widow, or dries up the flow Of a lone orphan's bitterness, the voice, The melting voice of sympathy, which heals, With a far softer touch, the wounded heart, Than the cold alms dropped by a scornful hand, That flings the dole it grudges,—such but tears Anew the closed wound open, while the friend, Who smiles when smoothing down the lonely couch, And does kind deeds, which any one can do Who has a feeling spirit, such a friend Heals with a searching balsam:—though her days Passed on in such sweet labors, still she felt Alone, and there was in her virgin heart A void that all her pleasures could not fill. She was not made to waste her years alone, But the great voice of Nature spake to her, That loving, and beloved by one like her, Youthful and beautiful, her heart would find In the fond interchange of looks and thoughts, And in the deep anxiety of love, The measure of her joyous spirit full. And such an one she found. One Sabbath eve She sat within an ivied church hard by, Beside her honored father, when the choir Sang their last chant, and the deep organ-peal Was dying through the twilight vault away; When the set sun had thrown upon the broad And checkered window one full saffron blaze, So that the pillars glittered, and the gold And crimson of the pulpit tapestry Shone like the clouds that curtained o'er the west, And seemed to glow, as they were folds of fire Hung round the dark blue mountains; when the light Fell through the aisles, and glanced along the seats So clear, the eye was dazzled, and all forms Were half intensely bright, and half deep shade;— Then, as the magic sunset, and the place Hallowed to her pure spirit, and the sounds Of closing melody, and the calm words, That asked a blessing on the silent crowd, Who listened to the prayer with breathless awe,— As these came o'er her feelings with a charm Of most delicious sweetness, when her soul Caught part of the new energy abroad In that deep-hallowed mansion, and was far Ascending to the glory which pervades The one Eternal Temple,—then her eye, Living with her rapt spirit, chanced to fall On the bright features of a noble youth, Whose eye fell full on hers. As if a sense Of kindred being had at once possessed Their spirits, and a sacred fire informed Their souls with one new life, they looked and loved. It was the birth of passion;—there went forth From each an influence, that as a chain Linked their young hearts together. They would turn Aside their eyes, but in an instant back They glanced and met; and as they met, they fell In deep confusion downward. Then their hearts Beat throbbingly; a blush rose on their cheeks, Flushing and fading like the changeful play Of colors on a dolphin. Thus they looked Few minutes, and then parted; but as back They sauntered to their several homes, they turned Momently to behold the lovely thing, Which, once beloved, grew dearer every time Their fond eyes met; and when they heard a sound From lips that long had trembled,—when the touch Thrilled them, and tender words were given in fear, So that the low voice quivered, and the words Died half unfinished,—it was then beheld As something more than mortal. Love went on, Day after day expanding, like the flower That closes with the darkness, and awakes When the new morn awakens. So their love Caught new life from their often interviews, And opened, and grew riper; their young hearts Beat in a truer harmony the more Their looks were blended, and their words exchanged. So they passed on in love, a flowery path Over a fragrant meadow, where all hues Of loveliness were painted, and all airs Of fragrance flowing. In the pure blue heaven, Calm as a summer day, serenity Smiled ever, and their hearts partook the calm That reigned so bright around them. 'T was a time Of Eden, such as soon will pass away, And leave the storm behind it. Not for earth, Not for the changeful beings who in sport Or sorrow dwell amid its thorns and flowers, Is this serenity a certain thing, Above the reach of passion, or the clouds That chill and darken. They had lived awhile Most happy, in their pure and innocent love: They were too young for evil; and they knew But ill the feeling which pervaded them, And drew them to each other's side, and made Their hours of meeting ecstasy. Their play, Their walks, their books, their talk of other days And other nations, all that they had gleaned From Nature and from man,—these had a zest, Which they could ill account for; but they knew, And keenly felt, its happiness. They looked Affection, but they told it not: their love Was silent; it grew on through many years, And ripened as the tender down of youth Showed the approach of manhood. Then it spake, And would not be denied. The quiet stream, Which through its banks of velvet turf and flowers Flowed in an unseen channel, with a voice Low whispering o'er its smooth and sandy bed,— This stream now gathered strength, and, checked and bound, Rushed to its freedom;—it could not prevail. The laws of honor, and the stern behest Of a false order, chained them, and compelled Their kindred spirits to a separate path, And told them they must part, and meet no more. Her life was humble, and her simple home Showed little of the greatness which lay hid Beneath so plain a shelter. Ivied walls, And woodbines trained to overarch the doors And windows; some few beds of summer flowers, And a wild shrubbery, where neatness reigned, And only checked the too luxuriant growth Of Nature, but subdued it not; within, A plain, well-ordered household, without show Of wealth or fashion;—this concealed from all, Who were not in the secret, what had marred The peace of its possessor, and had drawn The parasite and flatterer to disturb The rest he sought so earnestly and long. He found it, and was happy. He had marked The growing fondness of these youthful ones, And sometimes feared, but did not yet refuse His sanction to their interviews. No sign Of aught but common friendship yet had met His watchful eye; but when he saw the flame Come forth in energy, and at the time When love is danger, and, if checked not, death,— Then he was filled with fears, and well he knew, Unless their fondness could be linked by law, In the pure bond of wedded love, that ruin Would soon o'ertake them, and his treasured child Be cast on the cold world, its sport and scorn Therefore he sought the parents of the youth, The high and lordly. In their castle hall They met him, under frowning battlements, Behind the high-arched gateway, in the midst Of trophies and of pictures, which revealed The greatness of their ancestry. Their pride Was stung by the base offer, and they spurned The good man from their presence, and pronounced Their deepest malediction on their son, If he should ever think of stooping down From the high perch of his nobility, To-woo and wed with plebeians, and those poor. It soon was ended;—with the generous heart Of a young noble, who has joined the pride Of lofty birth with all the unchecked force Of nature, he refused to bend his soul To the stern mandates of society. He loved,—loved keenly; and he could not bow To what seemed tyranny, and so he sought His wonted happiness, at least the bliss Of mutual tears, and vows of tenderness, Never to leave their loves, but always cling To the fixed hope, that there should be a time When they could meet unfettered, and be blessed With the full happiness of certain love. He sought his usual meeting, but he found The welcome door closed on him, and was told, He must away, for though his noble life, Bright with its many virtues, and high deeds, Had naught to alienate her father's heart, Yet their unequal fortunes must for ever Part them, and therefore he must not delay. He turned with heavy heart, and slowly went, With often pauses, to the sounding shore, And, seated on a broken rock, looked long Over the far, blue waters. “I will go,” He said, after long silence, “I will go To other lands, and find in other worlds Wherewith to quell this passion, if a love So long and deeply cherished can be quelled By time and change. There is no pleasure here; The cold, dead-hearted nuptials, which the great Seek, in their anxious longing to retain The show of their once sure ascendency, Made sure by personal greatness, and the sway Of a high spirit, and a lofty mind O'er meaner souls,—these are my deepest scorn, My horror, and my loathing. I am one Who find within me a nobility That spurns the idle prating of the great, And their mean boast of what their fathers were, While they themselves are fools, effeminates, The scorn of all who know the worth of mind And virtue. I have cherished in my heart A love for one whose beauty would have charmed In Athens, and have won the sensual love Of Eastern monarchs; but to the pure heart, And the great soul within her, 't is to me As nothing, and I know what 't is to love A spiritual beauty, and behind the foil Of an unblemished loveliness still find Charms of a higher order, and a power Deeper and more resistless. Had I found Such thoughts and feelings, such a clear, deep stream Of mind, in one whom vulgar men had thrown As a dull pebble from them, I had loved, Not with a love less fond, nor with a flame Of less intense devotion. I must go; I must forget. There is a sense of death Comes o'er me, when I tear myself away From one so bright and lovely. Had the sun Set in an endless darkness, life had been Not darker than the journey I must take Alone, along a hard and thorny way, Where only interest rules, and faith and love Are banished, and the cold and heartless crowd Live, each the other's plunderer, as if life Were only meant for rapine, and poor man Were made to prey upon his kindred wretch. But I must go;—only one short adieu, Only a few fond words, a few dear looks, One kiss at parting, and our hopes are ended. We long have dreamed of happiness, long known Joys which were more than mortal, long have felt The bliss of mingled hearts and blended souls, And long have thought the vision was eternal; It vanishes, and I am now a wretch, And what will be her sorrows, none can tell.” The sun was setting, and his last rays threw Bright colors on the clouds that hung around The mountains, dimly rising in the west, Over a broad expanse of sheeted gold, On which a ship lay floating. It was calm,— Her sails were set, but yet the dying wind Scarce wooed them, as they trembled on the yard With an uncertain motion. She arose, As a swan rises on her gilded wings, When on a lake at sunset she uprears Her form from out the waveless stream, and steers Into the far, blue ether,—so that ship Seemed lifted from the waters, and suspended, Winged with her bright sails, in the silent air. A voice came from that ship, the voice of joy, The song of a light heart, and it invoked The coming of the breeze, to send them forth Over the rolling ocean. He looked out On the wide sea, and on the sheeted bay, And on the rocking vessel; and at once His purpose was resolved. He must away, He must to other regions, and there strive To conquer love so cherished. He drew out His pencil, and then traced few hurried lines, Telling her of his absence, and his hope Of happiness at his return, and yet Ending it with a fear that he should never Cross the wide waters to her. He too gave His signal; if perchance a ship drew near, And bore a pennon on the topmast yard, White with a heart stamped on it, she might know He was there, hastening home, and be prepared To meet him, and be happy. This he took, And up a narrow valley, hung with trees, Whose roots clung to the rifted rock, whose boughs Met, and o'erarched the glade,—along the bank Of a clear stream, that calmly wound its way Under this verdant canopy, and flowed Through a fresh turf, and beds of scented flowers,— Up this he took his path, and as he drew Near to the garden wall, and stood with ear Attentive to a sound, that came to him On the still evening air as if a hymn Were sung above the clouds, and floated down Through mist and dews, and softly fell to earth, Charming the ear of darkness, soon he saw Beneath a vine bower, seated on a couch Of closely matted turf, the tender girl, Where all his wishes centred, and he drew Silently through the thicket to her side. She started first in fear, but when she saw The well-known youth, she deeply blushed and smiled; Then thinking of his banishment, she dropped Warm tears of truest sorrow. He, with fond And feeling voice, consoled her, and renewed His oft repeated vows, and told of years Of undisturbed affection,—how that time And truth would conquer, and their love would be Brighter by their affliction. Though his heart Ached with the thought of parting, and was forced Even to a stern composure, yet he smiled To make her happy. “We must part awhile; I must go o'er the sea to other lands; It is the call of duty; but fear not, I shall return, and then our loves are sure. Dream not of danger on the sea,—one Power Protects us always, and the honest heart Fears not the tempest. We must part awhile; A few short months,—though short, they must be long Without thy dear society; but yet We must endure it, and our love will be The fonder after parting,—it will grow Intenser in our absence, and again Burn with a keener glow when I return. Fear not; this is my last resolve, and this My parting kiss.” He put the folded lines In her soft hand, and kissed her offered lips Ardently, and then suddenly withdrew From her embrace, and down the narrow vale Fled on with hasty footsteps to the shore. Along the beach he wandered, looking out Upon the glorious sunset, which arrayed All things in glory, painting them with gold And deepest red and azure. Overhead The sky was colored with a purest blue, And there one star shone forth, the star of love, His beacon; and it hung above the ship As if it led him thither. He received The omen, and went onward. Out at sea The broad waves heaved, now blue, now green, now tipped With a gilt foam, and on the unruffled bay There was a circle round the setting sun Of a most glittering gold; and as it spread Farther and farther out, it changed its hue To a clear, glassy silver, till it seemed Thin air, and the far mountains hung above it Suspended in the sky. They darkly frowned, And their long shadows travelled o'er the bay, As the sun sank still lower, while their ridge Glowed like a flaming furnace, and a line Of mottled clouds, that rose behind them, streaming Into the clear, cold north, was dyed with tints, Like the new rainbow when it first comes out From the dark bosom of the thunder-cloud, And spans it with its beauty, or the hues That veiled Aurora, when she first awoke And sprang from darkness, and with saffron robe And rosy fingers, drove her fiery car On over Ida to the higher heaven. He went amid these glorious things of earth, Transient as glorious, and along the beach Of snowy sands, and rounded pebbles, walked, Watching the coming of the evening tide, Rising with every ripple, as it kissed The gravel with a softly gurgling sound, And still advancing up the level shore, Till, in his deep abstraction, it flowed round His footprints, and awoke him. When he came Where a long reef stretched out, and in its bays, Scooped from the shelving rocks, received the sea, And held it as a mirror deep and dark, He paused, and standing then against the ship, He gave his signal. Soon he saw on board The stir of preparation; they let down A boat, and soon her raised and dipping oars Flashed in the setting light, and round her prow The gilt sea swelled and crinkled, spreading out In a wide circle; and she glided on Smoothly, and with a whispering sound, that grew Louder with every dipping of the oars, Until she neared the reef, and sent a surge Up through its coves, and covered them with foam. He stepped on board, and soon they bore him back To the scarce rocking vessel, where she lay Waiting the night-wind. On the deck he sat, And looked to one point only, save at times, When his eye glanced around the mingled scene Of beauty and sublimity. Meanwhile The sun had set, the painted sky and clouds Put off their liveries, the bay its robe Of brightness, and the stars were thick in heaven. They looked upon the waters, and below Another sky swelled out, thick set with stars, And checkered with light clouds, which from the north Came flitting o'er the dim-seen hills, and shot Like birds across the bay. A distant shade Dimmed the clear sheet; it darkened, and it drew Nearer. The waveless sea was seen to rise In feathery curls, and soon it met the ship, And a breeze struck her. Quick the floating sails Rose up and drooped again. The wind came on Fresher; the curls were waves; the sails were filled Tensely; the vessel righted to her course, And ploughed the waters; round her prow the foam Tossed, and went back along her polished sides, And floated off, bounding the rushing wake, That seemed to pour in torrents from her stern. The wind still freshened, and the sails were stretched, Till the yards cracked. She bent before its force, And dipped her lee-side low beneath the waves. Straight out she went to sea, as when a hawk Darts on a dove, and with a motionless wing Cuts the light, yielding air. The mountains dipped Their dark walls to the waters, and the hills Scarce reared their green tops o'er them. One white point, On which a lighthouse blazed, alone stood out In the broad sea, and there he fixed his eye, Taking his last look of his native shore. Night wore away, and still the wind blew strong, And the ship ploughed the waves, which now were heaved In high and rolling billows. All were glad, And laughed and shouted as she darted on, And plunged amid the foam, and tossed it high Over the deck, as when a strong, curbed steed Flings the froth from him in his eager race. All had been dimly star-lit, but the moon, Late rising, silvered o'er the tossing sea And lighted up its foam-wreaths, and just threw One parting glance upon the distant shores. They met his eye;—the sinking rocks were bright, And a clear line of silver marked the hills, Where he had said farewell. A sudden tear Gushed, and his heart was melted; but he soon Repressed the weakness, and he calmly watched The fading vision. Just as it retired Into the common darkness, on his eyes Sleep fell, and with his looks turned to his home, And, dearer than his home, to her he loved, He closed them, and his thoughts were lost in dreams, Bright and too glad to be realities. Calmly he slept, and lived on happy dreams, Till from the bosom of the boundless sea, Now spreading far and wide without a shore, The cloudless sun arose, and he awoke. The sky was still serene, and from the bed Of ocean darted forth the glowing sun, And flashed along the waters. On they sailed: The wind blew steady, and they saw that sun Rise, and go down, and set, and still it blew Freshly and calmly. They had left the shore Long leagues behind them, and the mid-sea now Bore them upon its bosom on their way To lands where other flowers and other trees Dress out the landscape, and where other men Walk in the light of heaven. Thither he went, And none knew, of his kindred, when or where He had escaped them. They with anxious quest Sought him, and after long and fruitless search Believed him dead. Awhile they mourned his loss, As great ones mourn, and then he passed away Into oblivion, and they filled his place In their affections with a gilded toy, And found their treasures ampler by his death. Not so with her who loved him; when he fled, She followed, but soon sank beneath the weight Of deep and sudden sorrow. He had gone Over the sea; had sought the dangerous wave, And might be wrecked, or on some distant shore Lingering a hopeless captive. To that point Where the flag waved, she often bent her steps, And gazed upon the ocean earnestly, Watching each dim speck on the farthest verge Of sight, and deeming every cloud a sail, And every wreath of foam her lover's sign. Two years had gone away, and she had thus Sought the high cliff at morning, noon, and night, And gazed in eager longing till her eye Was fixed and glazed. Her cheek grew thin and pale; Her form was wasted; and all knew that sorrow Preyed on the blossom of her health, and ate Her life away. A little while, and death Would come to her deliverance. Little know The cold, unfeeling crowd how strong the love, The first, warm love of youth; how long it lives Unfed and unrequited; how it bears Absence and cruel scorn, and still looks calm And patient on the eye that turns aside And shows its studied coldness,—how much more It burns and feeds upon the flame of life, When it was fully met, and found a heart As warm and ardent, and as bent to hers, As hers to him. Youth is the time of love; All other loves are lifeless, and but flowers Wreathed round decay, and with a livid hue Blowing upon a grave. The first, fresh love Dies never wholly; it lives on through pain And disappointment: often when the heart Is crushed, and all its sympathies pressed out, This lingers and awakens, and shines bright, Even on the borders of a wretched grave. Unhappy he, who throws that gift away; Unhappy he, who lets a tender heart, Bound to him by the earliest ties of love, Fall from him by his own neglect and die, Because it met no kindness, and was spurned Even in the earnest offer. Life soon fades, And with it love; and when it once has faded, There is no after bloom, no second spring. “So passes in the passage of a day The flower and verdure of our mortal life; Nor, though the Spring renew her fruits and flowers, Doth it renew its beauty, but it fades Once and for ever. Let us pluck the rose In the unclouded morning of this day, Which soon will lose its bright serenity. O, let us pluck the first blown rose of love; Let us love now in this our fairest youth, When love can find a full and fond return.” “Cosi trapassa al trapassar d' un giorno,” &amp;c.— Tasso. One evening I had wandered by the shore, Looking upon the ocean, as it lay Spread in its beauty round me. 'T was a time For spirits, all had such serenity. Scarce had a cloud checkered the autumn sky, That rose above me in a boundless arch Of purest azure. All the woods were hung With many tints, the fading livery Of life, in which it mourns the coming storms Of winter, and the quiet winds awoke Faint dirges in their withered leaves, and breathed Their sorrows through the groves. My heart felt soft Under their tender influence. I seemed A sharer in the grief of sighing winds And whispering trees. I clomb the rock, and trod The dying grass that grew upon its brow, And gazed upon the ocean, now as bright As in the freshest spring, unchangeable, Always the same, or only to the force Of calm and tempest yielding, never old, And never fading; in its wildest storms Soon to be calm, and when in sheeted light Spread to the farthest circle of the sky, Soon to obey the winds and wake in wrath. I walked along that rock, and heard the waves Chafing its foot, and saw the tossing foam Playing in eddies round it. Then the tide Had risen, and a wind came from the sea, Curling the little waves, until they broke In infant surges on the murmuring shore. The sky grew dark; and, as I homeward turned, I saw a woman sitting by the staff On which the signal hung, with mantle wrapped Close round her, and with eye intently fixed On an approaching vessel, as it came Quickly before the wind, and up the bay Glided. She followed it with earnest look, Until it turned a distant point, and drew Dimly behind the hills, and vanished. Then She turned again to sea, and long she looked On the white curls of foam, as if she saw A signal there; but yet there was no sail On the dark waters. With a lingering foot Back she retired, and, often turning, looked Still earnestly abroad, and found no hope. I saw her weep, and faintly hang her head, As a pale lily hangs, when, filled with rain, After long summer heat and heavy showers, It bends upon its withered stalk, and sheds The unwelcome moisture. Slowly she withdrew Into a thicket, where a trodden path, Her daily path, led to her father's home. He saw her fading cheek; he knew the fire That wasted her; and with a parent's love He sought to heal her grief, but only made The wound still deeper. Comfort cannot soothe The heart, whose life is centred in the thought Of happy loves once known, and still in hope Living with a consuming energy. He found remonstrance fruitless, reason vain; And therefore, with a kindness which was wise, He humored her, and let her seek that rock Unchecked, and only watched, that naught of harm Might meet her. So she sought it when the snow Mantled it, and the sea was rudely lashed By the cold north-wind; but a father's hand Was near to guard her. It was now divined, That he whom she had loved had crossed the sea, And still was living, and would soon return. Some then were joyous, not with unfeigned joy; For when they told their hopes, that he would come From his long wanderings home, they inly felt A sorrow, which revealed itself, and checked Often the words of comfort which they gave To those who wept his loss sincerely, those Who cannot conquer nature, which will make A child for ever dear, and through the clouds, That vice and selfish greatness cast around, Sometimes will flash abroad, and be revealed. Winter had passed away, and then Spring came, Lovely as ever, with her crown of flowers, And dress of verdure. She was decked with smiles, And as she danced along the springing turf, New flowers awoke to welcome her, and birds Hailed her from bush and forest. Then the sea, Girt by its greener shores, seemed rolling on With brighter waves, and the sun sparkled there With an unusual brilliancy. The earth Was beautiful, and like the seat of Gods, Or what we dream of Eden; and all hearts Were sharers in its gladness. Bird and beast Felt it, and, as they leaped, or as they flew, They spake their joy; and even the voiceless woods, Mute in themselves, were vocal with the winds, And the low-murmuring breezes through their boughs Seemed to speak out their still and quiet bliss. All hearts were glad with the glad season. One Alone knew naught of pleasure, and the smiles Of others were a mockery to her, And told her of the joy that once had been, But was not, and she could not hope would be. Hope, by too long deferring, had gone out, And left her soul in darkness. Still she went Daily to that one point, and there she gazed Fixedly on the ocean, till her head Grew dizzy, and her reason almost went; And then she wandered home, and wept away The fever of her brain. A woodbine grew Over her window, and its leaves shut out The light, and now its flowers were opening forth Their sweetness, and the wind that entered there Came loaded with its perfume. Once she loved The tufted flowers, and she inhaled their breath With a deep sense of gladness; but she now Repelled it as a hateful thing, and wished The vine were torn and scattered. Every year A linnet came, and built her cup-like nest Within that arbor, and she fed her young, And sang them to their slumbers, and at dawn Wakened them with her clear and lively note. She fed the timid creature, till it grew Familiar, and would sit upon her hand, And pick the crumbs she gave it; but she now Neglected it, and when it came, and sought Her former kindness, she regarded not Its fluttering and its song. Her heart was chilled And dead to all its softer sympathies. It cherished but one feeling,—hopeless love, Love stronger by endurance, ever growing With the decay of life and all its powers. He had been wandering long, and found no rest. Nothing could tear the image from his soul, That dwelt there as an ever-present God, Controlling all his being. He had seen Nature in a new beauty; and a heart Free from all other influence had swelled Beneath the bright enchantment; but he looked On all the fair variety around With a cold eye, because he looked alone, And felt that what he looked on was not seen By one who had been ever in his walks, As an attendant spirit, watching all That lifted him, or soothed him, with a sense Of kindred awe or pleasure. When alone, He could not mingle with the glorious things Of earth and heaven; he could not pass away Into the open depths of the far sky, And dwell among its many-colored forms Of cloud and vapor, where they hung the arch, As with imperial tapestry, and veiled The throne of the Omnipotent. The Earth, Now in its newest spring, all dressed with flowers, And redolent of roses and of vines From their wide purple beds, and sunward slopes, Where the bee murmured, and the early dews Soon rose in clouds of perfume, as the dawn Came o'er the pine-clad mountains, and lit up A world of present life and ancient ruin, Where the rose bloomed as brightly, and the vine Shot forth as heavy clusters, and full wreaths Of ivy twined around each tottering pile, And mantled arch and column, with its deep, Luxuriant verdure; all that he beheld Of ever-growing nature, and of man, Whose works are fading, and when they decay Have no restoring energy, but drop Fragment by fragment into utter ruin,— All that had waked in other hearts the love Of ancient glory, and the proud resolve To be, as they were, glorious, or had filled The soul with sorrow, and the eyes with tears, Over their fallen greatness, yet had made This sorrow partly joyous, by the sight Of a new life for ever springing round them, And still as fresh and fragant as when first, Bright from the quarry, their new temples stood Proud in the sun, and lifted high their fronts To the admiring eye of gods and men,— This had to him no pleasure; he could not Rase out the deep-fixed passion, which so long Had been his daily happiness, and formed And fashioned all his studies and his joys To this one pure enjoyment. Earth was fair, And Heaven was glorious, when he heard her say They were thus fair and glorious; but alone, They had no form nor color, and were lost In one dim, melancholy hue of death. And so with man,—he wandered through the crowd In solitude, that coldest solitude, Which tortures, while it chills us. They were gay And busy, but he heeded not; the great Rolled by him, and were noticed not; the poor Pleaded, and yet he listened not;—one thought Alone went with him, and all other things Stirred round him like the shadows of a dream. He would not linger thus; he looked to home, And her who gave to home a double charm. He was resolved, and soon again the sea Received him; and for many days the sun Beheld him steering to his native shore. 'T was a calm summer evening. One white sail Moved on the silent water, motionless, Scarce stealing to the shore. She watched that sail, And followed it with an inquiring eye, In every tack it took to catch the wind, Fancying she saw the signal. Slowly on It came. The glassy ocean seemed to change At distance into air; and so the ship Seemed moving like a bird along the sky. Sometimes it stood athwart her, and the sails, Hung loosely on the yards, seemed waving lines Tinged with the sunset; and again it turned With prow directed to her, and at once The broad white canvas threw its silvery sheet Full on her eye, and glittering in the west. Nearer it came, but slowly; till at length Its form was marked distinctly, and she caught Eagerly, as it waved upon a yard Near the main topmast, what her wearied eye Had sought so long, and found not. It was there,— The signal, one white pennon, with a heart Stamped in its centre; and at once her joy Was speechless and overflowing. Fixed, she looked With trembling earnestness, and down her cheeks The tears ran fast, and her scarce-moving lips Had words without a voice. Thus she sat long, Motionless in the fervor of her joy, Absorbed in one emotion, which had bound Her form unto her spirit, and had made All other powers the ministers to thought. They hurried through her mind, her first, fond love, Its many pleasures, hours of early hope Unclouded by the fear of coming ill, And present happiness, which, like the dawn In the sweet month of May, is full of life, And yet serene and tranquil, budding out With blossoms of futurity, and spreading To the bright eye of Heaven the tender flowers, Where the young fruit lies hidden, till the sun Ripen it to its full maturity. These hurried through her mind, and with them came Long, anxious days, long days of bitterness, Dark with the fears that weigh upon the heart Whose love is young and tender, when the chance Of sea or battle passes o'er the head Of him who has the secret of her soul. The sun was setting, and the dazzling orb Sunk down behind the mountains, darting up Long rays of golden light into the air, Like glories round the sacred countenance In one of Raphael's pictures. All was clear But one dark cloud, which rose from out the point Where the storm gathers after sultry days, And launches forth the lightning. This heaved up Its dusky billows, and their tips were tinged With a bright flame, while all below was dark Fearfully, and it swelled before the wind, Like the strong canvas of a gallant ship Standing before the tempest. It just crowned The hill at sunset; but it now came on, First slowly, till it rose upon the air, Frowning, and threw its shadow o'er the earth, And flashed intensely; then it seemed to move With a new pace, and every instant swept Still farther on the sky, and sent its voice Deep-roaring with the mingled sound of winds Amid the shaken forests, and the peals Re-echoed from the mountains. Now the sea Darkened beneath its shadow, and it curled Without a breath, as if it shook in fear Before the coming tempest. She looked wild, First on the cloud, then on the ship, which now Steered to a cove behind a sandy point, On which the lighthouse stood, but yet the winds Were light and baffling, and against her course; And so the sails flapped loosely, and she rocked Motionless on the crisping waves, and lay Waiting, a victim, for the threatening storm. Then, as she looked with an intenser gaze, She saw the sweeps put out, and every arm Strained to the effort, but their strength availed not To send them to a haven. Then her heart Sank, and her hopes were darkened, till her form Shook with her fears. The clouds rolled on the wind In mingling billows, and the lightnings leaped From point to point; then in an instant burst The thunder-crash, and one undying roar Filled the wide air. At last the cold wind came, And the flag streamed and quivered, and her robes Flew lightly round her. First, short broken waves Rose on the bay; their tops were white with foam, And on they hurried, like the darting flight Of sea-mews when they fly before the storm. She looked upon the ship; all hands aloft Took in the sails, and scarcely were they furled, When the blast struck her. To its force she bowed, And as the waves rose now with mountain swell, Upward she sprang, and then she rushed away Into the gulfy waters. Now the storm Stood o'er her, and the rain and hail came down In torrents. All was darkness; through the air The gushing clouds streamed onward, and they took The nearest headlands from her straining sight, And made the sea invisible, but when A flash revealed it, and she saw the surge Pouring upon the rocks below, all foam And fury. What a mingled sound above, Around her, and beneath her! One long peal Seemed to pervade the heavens; and one wide rush Of winds and rain poured by her; and the sound Of the dashed billows on the rocks below Rang like a knell. No vessel met her then; They lit the signal lamp, she saw it not; They fired the gun, but in the louder roar Of waters it was drowned, and they were left Alone to struggle with the warring waves. A cry went forth, “A ship was on the rocks!” And hundreds crowded to the shore to aid The suffering crew, and fires were kindled there, But all availed not,—not a man was saved. The storm went swiftly by; and soon the winds Subsided, and the western sky shone out, And light glanced o'er the waters. On a reef, That stretched from off the cliffs along that shore, The broken wreck lay scattered; and at last One and another corse came floating up, But none were saved. They wandered o'er the sands; And here a bale lay stranded, there an oar, And there a yard. Just as the cloud had flown Over the zenith, and the moon shone out From its dark bosom, she went down the rocks, And bent her trembling steps along the shore. The moon looked out in sadness, and her light Threw a faint glimmering on the broken waves, And paled the dying watch-fires, as they fell Flickering away, and showed the fearful looks Of those who watched the wreck, and stood to save. The waves still rolled tremendously, and burst Loud thundering on the rocks: they tossed the foam High up the hills, and ploughed the moving sands, Sweeping the fragments forth, then rushing back With a devouring strength, that cleared the shore. The west shone fair; the evening star was bright, And many glittering stars were gathering round, Set in a deep, dark blue. The distant hills Showed faintly, and long wreaths of mist arose Curling around their sides, like cottage smoke Sent from the hidden valley in the dawn. O'er all the moon presided, and her face, Though clear, was darkened, and it filled the heart Of the beholder with a silent awe, And a cold, heavy sadness. On the sea Her light descended, and a silver wake Came from beneath her onward to the shore, Crossing the bursting waves. The cloud still lay Dark-rolling in the east, and often sent Pale flashes forth; and still the thunder growled Fainter and fainter, as the storm moved on Over the distant ocean. There the moon Lit a faint bow, that spanned the cloud, and seemed Just fading into darkness. All was still, But the contending waters, and the drops, Now trickling from the forest leaves, were heard Pattering upon the grass; and as a sign That a sure calm had come, the fire-fly lit Its lamp along the meadows, and the chirp Of the green locust from the thicket told How tranquil was the air. A solemn fear Went through the hearts of all, as they surveyed The corpses, but their faces all were strange. They took them from the beach, and decently Conveyed them to a shelter, there to wait The last sad offices. Alone she went Still farther on the shore, until she came Where a long reef stood out, on which the ship Was broken; and the very reef where he First went on board, despairing and resolved. One feeling led her onward, and sustained Her wasted body (which was sinking fast Beneath the desperate conflict) with the strength Of madness, and her easy steps betrayed not The woe that wrung within her. She had seen Her lover standing far upon that reef; Had seen the boat go there, and bear him off, And as the ship went out to sea had fainted. Therefore she sought that reef, with a wild hope— Such often tokens madness—that she there Might find him safely rescued. She now stood On the projecting rocks, and as she threw Her dark eye downward to a glimmering cove, She saw him. Lifted by the swelling wave, He seemed yet living, and a shrill laugh told Her glad but wandering spirit. Down she leaped And clasped him;—he was motionless and cold. She kissed him, but he opened not his eyes, And smiled not. Then she spake the much-loved name, With an endearing tone, but none replied. “Art thou not living? Thou wert once so kind, Thy smile so happy, and thy kiss so warm! But thou art cold now, and thine eye darts not Upon me, as it wont to do; thy lips Move not, thou hast no voice, no welcome for me.” She raised her head, and as she caught the moon Half veiled in vapor, from her glassy eye The tears stole down, and with a quivering voice, Faint as a night-wind through the falling leaves In autumn, “It is over then,” she spake; “The dream is over; he indeed is wrecked, As I had fancied long; he cannot wake; This is not sleep; there is no life-blood here; No flush upon his forehead; he is cold, And will not wake again. He said to me, Farewell, perhaps for ever;—O, too true The last fond words at parting!—but for ever— Ah, no!—I meet him,—I have lingered long,— He calls me on my journey,—he awaits me, And why do I delay?—I come, my love;— Only a moment, and I come, my love.” Suddenly she sprang forth, with outstretched arms, And a wild look, that told there was no hope; A few short steps, she paused, and then sank down, As a flower sinks upon the new-mown turf, Beautiful even in death. They came, and raised The dying girl. Her loose locks floated wide; And on her slender neck her languid head Drooped, and her eyes were closed. Her lips still moved With the last breath, and then were still. At once Her madness was no more. A tender smile Played round her, and her looks were full of love And gentleness, such as when first she met, And first awoke his love. She long had borne The conflict, and with desperate energy Been nerved to all endurance; but this shock Subdued her, and her spirit had departed, And well they knew its passage was in peace. They both were buried, where they first had met, Beneath one stone, and they were wept by all. A willow grows above them, with its boughs Drooping, as if in sorrow; and at night A sweet bird sings there, and the village girls Say 't is a spirit's voice. They dress that grave Each Sabbath-day with roses; and they strew Fresh violets there on May-day, and then sing A simple tale of true love, till their hearts Are swelling, and their cheeks are bathed in tears. Love knows no rank, and when two hearts would meet On earth, but cannot, they will meet in Heaven. All hearts that love are equal in the grave. THE DREAM OF A DAY, AND OTHER POEMS. FIRST PUBLISHED IN 1843. THE DREAM OF A DAY. In silent gloom the world before me lay, In deepest night embosomed it reposed; All genial hues of life had passed away, In sleep profound the eye of day had closed; Beamed through the voiceless calm no fitful ray, Great Nature's heart to stillness all composed; Oblivious dreams alone were moving there, Like soft wings fanning light the summer air. Meseemed a rustling plume was hovering o'er me,— Unwonted yearnings thronged around my heart; A spirit, half unseen, stood dim before me;— I caught the vision with unconscious start, And suddenly a shadowy grasp upbore me, Swift as the glancing of a feathered dart, Gently as stream of air through darkness gliding, Then softly as on pillowed down subsiding. Silence was broken, as my flight descended;— A whispered tone of most Æolian sweetness, Where many voices seemed accordant blended All to a dulcet swell of full completeness, Breathing as if by golden harps attended, Now lingering slow, now waked to magic fleetness, Heaved now in solemn surge, now faintly falling, Like voice of love in airy distance calling. Again all laid in deeper calm, as when The midnight storm, far o'er the hills departing, Murmurs in echoes lightly first, and then Whispers its soft farewell, the spirit starting At the still hush that follows, or as when pain, Like flashes through the frame intensely darting, Yields to a soothing balm, how blest reposes The heart, and slumber sweet the eyelid closes. All lay a void before me, when afar Just gleamed, as moonlight through a rifted cloud, A tremulous ray, fainter than smallest star Quivering through haze, and dim as spectre shroud Floating in night of caves, while round the air Gathered intenser gloom: as ocean, ploughed By gliding keel, trembles in liquid light, So dawned that ray forth from profoundest night. Slowly it dawned, and images arose From out the void, as worlds from chaos born, Hovering like phantoms o'er a stream that flows Deep under veil of mist in earliest morn: As leafy boughs, when fresh the zephyr blows, Shift in the wave, or on the dew-bright thorn Quick rainbows dance, uncertain so they played, And half unveiled, amid that world of shade. Then from the abyss, as pillared flame ascending, Upstreamed a fuller day, and widely rolled Its kindling light, distincter being lending To what seemed shadowy dreams; its iris fold Turned slowly back the night, in vain contending Before its fulgent arms: first silvery cold They gleamed, then warm and golden glowed before me; Earth smiled around, and heaven's blue glittered o'er me. A scene of orient pomp, where lay united In loved embrace the vivid and the tender,— Temple and tower, by self-effulgence lighted, Streaming through clustered palms their magic splendor,— Column, the fervent pilgrim hailed delighted, Reared to his country's saviour and defender,— Palace, whose thousand windows, ruby-flashing, Tinted the fountain o'er its terrace dashing. Again in classic beauty still reposing, A soft Ionian sky above it swelling,— Long flowery vales in gentle vistas closing,— Peaks snowy pure, dark summits cloud-compelling,— Smooth marble hills, the wandering bee composing To nectared sleep,—rocks, the mysterious dwelling Of prescient god,—bright city, fitly moulded, Round lofty fane and citadel enfolded. Again wild nature,—Alp on Alp uplifted, Shooting into the heaven in pointed pride,— Rose-tinted snows, blue, glassy torrents rifted Deep to dark night,—dim gorges yawning wide 'Mid jetty crags, o'er which the cat'ract, drifted In surging foam, heaved broad its thund'ring tide,— Far glimpses through rude glens to lake and stream Reposing peacefully, as in a dream. And then a pastoral scene of my own land,— Groves darkly green, white farms, and pastures gay With golden flowers,—brooks stealing over sand Or smooth-worn pebbles, murmuring light away,— Blue rye-fields, yielding to the gentle hand Of the cool west-wind,—scented fields of hay, Falling in purple bloom,—free hearts that feel Their being doubled in their country's weal. And there my heart reposed, as mother yearning Over her cradled infant, sweetly smiling In innocent dreams,—its rose lip lightly turning In slumbering joy, some shape of love beguiling Its quiet soul to bliss; so I, discerning Those scenes where erst my happy spirit, whiling In sportful peace life's dawn away, yet knew No griefs that wring, felt life revived anew. Beneath a broad-crowned oak, on sloping hill O'erlooking wide the lovely region round, On soft, thick turf I lay: the air was still; Distinctly heard was each remotest sound, The clacking wheel in cornfield, at the mill The circling plash, and far the faint rebound Of low and bleat from mountain-side, the stir Of insect swarms, the drone bee's hum and swirr. The sun rolled on to noon: through the light leaves Scarce quivering in the tremulous air, the blue Of heaven looked gently, as when fondly weaves Young love its tenderest smile, while trembling through Checked tears—for even when blest it inly grieves Unconscious—darts its glance, as light through dew. In the cool shade I lay, while o'er the ground Waved the warm undulations wide around. Half slumbering I lay:—then as a veil Fell the faint lid, and dim the scene afar Floated in magic shade: the freshening gale, Breathed from the rolling sea, then stirred the air And whispering softly, as the fond heart's tale Told in the twilight dusk, awoke me there With its cool kisses; low the sun descending With the blue mountain haze was richly blending. Evening came on apace: in full-orbed glory The sun drew to his couch,—through vistaed trees He glided,—flashing broad and full he wore a Look of unwonted joy, for rest and ease After his day of toil,—far clouds hung hoary Along the east, then kindled by degrees As slow he sunk,—fresh bloomed the aerial rose, While streamed the west, as gushing furnace glows. Twilight erelong to solemn darkness faded: The wide funereal flame grew amber clear, And, ever lower sinking, softly shaded Its light with mellower tints; round the wide sphere A belt of palest violet was braided, Pale as the flower we scatter on the bier; This died away, and one by one on high The stars took up their night-watch in the sky. I sat amid the darkness, and above The oak looked spectrally, while every star Hung o'er me like a messenger of love, Herald of some fair world, if world more fair Than this brave earth has being; as a dove Hovering suspended in the summer air, Peace brooded with light wings, the voiceless sleep Of tired hearts beating low in slumber deep. A spirit stood before me, half unseen, Majestic and severe, yet o'er him played A genial light;—subdued though high his mien, As by a strong, collected spirit swayed,— In even balance justly poised between Each wild extreme, proud strength by feeling stayed,— Dwelling in upper realms serenely bright, Lifted above the shadowy sphere of night. He stood before me, and I heard a tone, Such as from mortal lips had never flowed, Soft, yet commanding, gentle, yet alone It bowed the listener's heart;—anon it glowed Intensely fervent, then, like wood-notes thrown On the chance winds, in airy lightness rode,— Now swelled like ocean surge, now pausing fell Like the last murmur of a muffled bell. “Lone pilgrim through life's gloom,” thus spake the shade, “Hold on with steady will along thy way: Thou by a kindly favoring hand wert made: Hard though thy lot, yet thine what can repay Long years of bitter toil,—the holy aid Of spirit aye is thine, be that thy stay: Thine to behold the true, to feel the pure, To know the good and lovely,—these endure. “Hold on,—thou hast in thee thy best reward; Poor are the largest stores of sordid gain, If from the heaven of thought the soul is barred, If the high spirit's bliss is sought in vain: Think not thy lonely lot is cold or hard, The world has never bound thee with its chain; Free as the birds of heaven thy heart can soar, Thou canst create new worlds,—what wouldst thou more? “The future age will know thee,—yea, even now Hearts beat and tremble at thy bidding, tears Flow as thou movest thy wand, thy word can bow Even ruder natures, the dull soul uprears As thou thy trumpet-blast attunest,—thou Speakest, and each remotest valley hears; Thou hast the gift of song,—a wealth is thine, Richer than all the treasures of the mine. “Hold on,—glad spirits company thy path,— They minister to thee, though all unseen; Even when the tempest lifts its voice in wrath, Thou joyest in its strength; the orient sheen Gladdens thee with its beauty; winter hath A holy charm that soothes thee, like the green Of infant May,—all nature is thy friend, All seasons to thy life enchantment lend. “Man too thou know'st and feelest,—all the springs That wake his smile and tear, his joy and sorrow, All that uplifts him on emotion's wings, Each longing for a fair and blest to-morrow, Each tone that soothes or saddens, all that rings Joyously to him, thou canst fitly borrow From thy own breast, and blend it in a strain, To which each human heart beats back again. “Thine the unfettered thought, alone controlled By Nature's truth; thine the wide-seeing eye, Catching the delicate shades, yet apt to hold The whole in its embrace,—before it lie Pictured in fairest light, as chart unrolled, Fields of the present and of destiny: The voice of Truth amid the senseless throng May now be lost; 't is heard and felt erelong. “Hold on,—live for the world,—live for all time;— Rise in thy conscious power, but gently bear Thy form among thy fellows; sternly climb The spirit's alpine peaks; 'mid snow towers there Nurse the pure thought, but yet accordant chime With lowlier hearts in valleys green and fair. Sustain thyself,—yield to no meaner hand, Even though he rule awhile thy own dear land. “Brief is his power; oblivion waits the churl Bound to his own poor self; his form decays, But sooner fades his name. Thou shalt unfurl Thy standard to the winds of future days;— Well mayest thou in thy soul defiance hurl On such who would subdue thee; thou shalt raise Thy name, when they are dust, and nothing more: Hold on,—in earnest hope still look before. “Nerved to a stern resolve, fulfil thy lot,— Reveal the secrets Nature has unveiled thee; All higher gifts by toil intense are bought;— Has thy firm will in action ever failed thee? Only on distant summits fame is sought;— Sorrow and gloom thy nature has entailed thee, But bright thy present joys, and brighter far The hope that draws thee like a heavenly star.” The voice was still;—its tone in distance dying Breathed in my ear, like harp faint heard at even, Soft as the autumn wind through sere leaves sighing, When flaky clouds athwart the moon are driven. Far through the viewless gloom the spirit flying, Winged his high passage to his native heaven, But o'er me still he seemed in kindness bending, Fresh hope and firmer purpose to me lending. GENIUS WAKING. Slumber's heavy chain hath bound thee,— Where is now thy fire? Feebler wings are gathering round thee,— Shall they hover higher? Can no power, no spell recall thee From inglorious dreams? O, could glory so appall thee With his burning beams? Thine was once the highest pinion In the midway air; With a proud and sure dominion, Thou didst upward bear: Like the herald, winged with lightning, From the Olympian throne, Ever mounting, ever brightening, Thou wert there alone. Where the pillared props of heaven Glitter with eternal snows, Where no darkling clouds are driven, Where no fountain flows,— Far above the rolling thunder, When the surging storm Rent its sulphury folds asunder, We beheld thy form. O, what rare and heavenly brightness Flowed around thy plumes, As a cascade's foamy whiteness Lights a cavern's glooms;— Wheeling through the shadowy ocean, Like a shape of light, With serene and placid motion, Thou wert dazzling bright. From that cloudless region stooping, Downward thou didst rush, Not with pinion faint and drooping, But the tempest's gush;— Up again undaunted soaring, Thou didst pierce the cloud, When the warring winds were roaring Fearfully and loud. Where is now that restless longing After higher things? Come they not, like visions, thronging On their airy wings? Why should not their glow enchant thee Upward to their bliss? Surely danger cannot daunt thee From a heaven like this. But thou slumberest;—faint and quivering Hangs thy ruffled wing, Like a dove's in winter shivering, Or a feebler thing. Where is now thy might and motion, Thy imperial flight? Where is now thy heart's devotion, Where thy spirit's light? Hark! his rustling plumage gathers Closer to his side, Close, as when the storm-bird weathers Ocean's hurrying tide;— Now his nodding beak is steady, Wide his burning eye,— Now his opening wings are ready, And his aim—how high! Now he curves his neck, and proudly— Now is stretched for flight;— Hark! his wings—they thunder loudly, And their flash—how bright! Onward—onward, over mountain, Through the rack and storm, Now like sunset over fountain Flits his glancing form. Glorious bird! thy dream has left thee, Thou hast reached thy heaven;— Lingering slumber hath not reft thee Of the glory given;— With a bold, a fearless pinion, On thy starry road, None, to fame's supreme dominion, Mightier ever trode. TO THE EAGLE. Bird of the broad and sweeping wing! Thy home is high in heaven, Where wide the storms their banners fling, And the tempest clouds are driven. Thy throne is on the mountain-top; Thy fields the boundless air; And hoary peaks, that proudly prop The skies, thy dwellings are. Thou sittest, like a thing of light, Amid the noontide blaze; The midway sun is clear and bright,— It cannot dim thy gaze. Thy pinions, to the rushing blast O'er the bursting billow spread, Where the vessel plunges, hurry past, Like an angel of the dead. Thou art perched aloft on the beetling crag, And the waves are white below, And on, with a haste that cannot lag, They rush in an endless flow. Again thou hast plumed thy wing for flight To lands beyond the sea, And away like a spirit wreathed in light, Thou hurriest wild and free. Thou hurriest over the myriad waves, And thou leavest them all behind; Thou sweepest that place of unknown graves, Fleet as the tempest wind. When the night-storm gathers dim and dark, With a shrill and a boding scream, Thou rushest by the foundering bark, Quick as a passing dream. Lord of the boundless realm of air! In thy imperial name The hearts of the bold and ardent dare The dangerous path of fame. Beneath the shade of thy golden wings, The Roman legions bore, From the river of Egypt's cloudy springs, Their pride, to the polar shore. For thee they fought, for thee they fell, And their oath was on thee laid: To thee the clarions raised their swell, And the dying warrior prayed. Thou wert, through an age of death and fears, The image of pride and power, Till the gathered rage of a thousand years Burst forth in one awful hour. And then, a deluge of wrath it came, And the nations shook with dread; And it swept the earth, till its fields were flame, And piled with the mingled dead. Kings were rolled in the wasteful flood, With the low and crouching slave; And together lay, in a shroud of blood, The coward and the brave. And where was then thy fearless flight? “O'er the dark, mysterious sea, To the lands that caught the setting light, The cradle of liberty. There, on the silent and lonely shore, For ages I watched alone, And the world, in its darkness, asked no more, Where the glorious bird had flown. “But there came a bold and hardy few, And they breasted the unknown wave; I caught afar the wandering crew, And I knew they were high and brave. I wheeled around the welcome bark, As it sought the desolate shore, And up to heaven, like a joyous lark, My quivering pinions bore. “And now that bold and hardy few Are a nation wide and strong, And danger and doubt I have led them through, And they worship me in song; And over their bright and glancing arms, On field and lake and sea, With an eye that fires, and a spell that charms, I guide them to victory.“ SENECA LAKE. One evening in the pleasant month of May, On a green hillock swelling from the shore Above thy emerald wave, when the clear west Was all one sheet of light, I sat me down, Wearied, yet happy. I had wandered long, That bright, fair day; and all the way my path Was tended by a warm and soothing air, That breathed like bliss; and round me all the woods Opened their yellow buds, and every cottage Was bowered in blossoms, for the orchard trees Were all in flower. I came, at close of day, Down to thy brink, and it was pleasure there To bathe my dripping forehead in thy cool, Transparent waters. I refreshed me long With the bright sparkling stream, and from the pebbles, That bedded all thy margin, singled out Rare casts of unknown shells, from off thy cliffs Broken by wintry surges. Thou wert calm, Even as an infant calm, that gentle evening; And one could hardly dream thou 'dst ever met And wrestled with the storm. A breath of air, Felt only in its coolness, from the west Stole over thee, and stirred thy golden mirror Into long waves, that only showed themselves In ripples on thy shore,—far distant ripples, Breaking the silence with their quiet kisses, And softly murmuring peace. Up the green hillock I mounted languidly, and at the summit On the new grass reposed, and saw that evening Fade sweetly over thee. Far to the south Thy slumbering waters floated, one long sheet Of burnished gold,—between thy nearer shores Softly embraced, and melting distantly Into a yellow haze, embosomed low 'Mid shadowy hills and misty mountains, all Covered with showery light, as with a veil Of airy gauze. Beautiful were thy shores, And manifold their outlines, here up-swelling In bossy green,—there hung in slaty cliffs, Black as if hewn from jet, and overtopped With the dark cedar's tufts, or new-leaved birch, Bright as the wave below. How glassy clear The far expanse! Beneath it all the sky Swelled downward, and its fleecy clouds were gay With all their rainbow fringes, and the trees And cliffs and grassy knolls were all repeated Along the uncertain shores,—so clearly seen Beneath the invisible transparency, That land and water mingled, and the one Seemed melting in the other. O, how soft Yon mountain's heavenly blue, and all o'erlaid With a pale tint of roses! Deep between The ever-narrowing lake, just faintly marked By its reflected light, and farther on Buried in vapory foam, as if a surf Heaved on its utmost shore. How deep the silence! Only the rustling boughs, the broken ripple, The cricket and the tree-frog, with the tinkle Of bells in fold and pasture, or a voice Heard from a distant farm, or hollow bay Of home-returning hound,—a virgin land Just rescued from the wilderness, still showing Wrecks of the giant forest, yet all bright With a luxuriant culture, springing wheat, And meadows richly green,—the blessed gift Of liberty and law. I gazed upon them, And on the unchanging lake, and felt awhile Unutterable joy,—I loved my land With more than filial love,—it was a joy That only spake in tears. With early dawn I woke, and found the lake was up before me, For a fresh, stirring breeze came from the south, And all its deep-green waves were tossed and mingled Into a war of foam. The new-risen sun Shone on them, as if they were worlds of stars, Or gems, or crystals, or some other thing Sparry and flashing bright. A gentle murmur, A roar scarce uttered, like a voice of mirth Amid the dancing waters, blended well With the Æolian whispering of boughs In a wide grove of pines. The fields and woods Were sparkling all with dew, and curling smoke Rose from the cottage fires;—the robin, too, And the brown thrush, and other birds concealed Amid the half-blown thickets, joyously Poured out their morning songs, and thus attended, I wandered by the shore. O, it was pleasant To feel the dashing of the dewy spray Rain on my forehead, and to look between Long crests of foam, into an unknown depth Of deepest green, and then to see that green Soft changing into snow. Over this waste Of rolling surges, on a lofty bank, With a broad surf beneath it, brightly shone White roofs and spires, and gilded vanes, and windows, Each like a flame,—thy peaceful tenements, Geneva, aptly named; for not the walls By the blue, arrowy Rhone, nor Leman's lake, With all its vineyard shores and mouldering castles, Nor even its shaggy mountains, nor above Its world of Alpine snows,—these are not more Than thou, bright Seneca, whether at peace, As I at evening met thee, or this morning, Tossed into foam. Thou too shalt have thy fame: Genius shall make thy hills his home, and here Shall build his airy visions,—bards shall come, And fondly sing thee,—pilgrims too shall haunt Thy sacred waters, and in after ages, O, may some votary sit on the hillock, At evening, by thy shore! LAYS OF THE SEASONS. SPRING. Come to my festival! Come to my festival! This is the first day of May; The sun is rejoicing alone in heaven; The clouds have all hurried away. Down in the meadow the blossoms are waking, Light on their twigs the young leaves are shaking; Round the warm knolls the lambs are a-leaping, The colt from his fold o'er the pasture is sweeping; And on the bright lake the little waves break, For there the cool west is at play. Come to my festival! Come to my festival! This is the first day of May. Come to my festival! Come to my festival! Lose not so happy a day: The maidens are pranking their locks with flowers, And donning their proudest array. Over the mountain the south-wind is rolling, And tossing its forest in billows, Through orchard and vineyard and garden strolling, And whispering among the green willows. Then mount the plumed bonnet, with true-love knots on it, Haste hither!—O, how can ye stay? Come to my festival! Come to my festival! This is the first day of May. SUMMER. Golden is the harvest field, Bright the sky above, And its orb a burning shield On the arm of Jove; Hot the wearied reaper toils Till the day is done, And the flashing ocean boils Round the setting sun. O, some cool, some midnight cave By the rushing river, There my beating pulse to lave, Sleep and dream for ever! All are now in serious strife, Gathering in their grain; 'T is their being, hope, and life:— Hark! the hurrying wain,— No! the distant thunder peal, Rolling from the hills:— See the eddying tempest wheel! How it swells and stills! High above its brazen van Juts—behind it roars Wind, hail, thunder;—what is man, When the deluge pours! AUTUMN. My horn is overflowing, My fruits all red, And not a wind is blowing, But sweets have fed. The vineyard slope is gushing With purple wine, And amber streams are rushing From every vine. Near hill to far blue mountain, Low vale and plain, Wild lake and rock-built fountain, My song of joy repeat again. Young girls beside their lovers Now pluck the vine,— Its yellow foliage covers Love's softest twine. With loaded baskets reeling, They home return; And when the dance is wheeling, Black eyes—they burn. Io, Io triumphe! The pæans swell; And now their nectar flowing, That gush of joy, O, who can tell! WINTER. Below me rings the lake, The stars above me burn, Away the skaters break, And glide and wheel and turn; Keen blows the cutting north, Against the wind they drive, And as they hurry forth, The air is all alive. Shout and carol, jest and boast, So they sound along; Send thy keenest arrows, Frost! We will give thee song. The east is growing bright, The crystal forest flashes, And in the dawning light, Like gold the cascade dashes. The rainbow spans the sky, But all her proudest show, Her deepest tinctures die Before the pomp below. Rock and river, tree and fountain, Glitter thick with gems; Rolling hill and craggy mountain Glow like diadems. THE LIGHT GUITAR. The light guitar, the light guitar! I hear its tinkling sound afar, Where underneath the evening star The dance is wheeling; And many a laugh, and many a shout, The busy echoes toss about, Till joyous with the merry rout The hills are pealing. The light guitar,—I know it well; I heard it first when evening fell Around the vine-embowered well By Rhone's broad river. Joy to thy valleys, gay Provence! Thou sunny paradise of France; Carols at eve, and song and dance, Are thine for ever. The light guitar,—it sends me where A living glory fills the air, And all of gay and bright and fair Is full to flowing. Below me sleeps the purple sea, Above me clouds of amber flee, And gold on every tower and tree And spire is glowing. The light guitar,—its warning sound Maiden and youth are thronging round, With song and shout, and leap and bound,— No dream of sorrow. Away with grief, away with care! Glad thoughts alone are welcome there; They care not, if or dark or fair May rise the morrow. Then glory to the light guitar,— Its holiest time the evening star, When liquid voices echo far By rock and river. O, might such heavenly nights be mine, Where overhead the rambling vine Lets quivering through the bright moonshine, By Rhone for ever! THE VINTAGE DANCE. Come, the dance, the dance! Night is nigh us: How the shades advance! Soon joy will fly us: Be happy while we may; Dull cares, away, away! Be only song and play, As time speeds by us. Our vintage all is in; Our vats o'erflowing;— Now wake the merry din, Eyes, cheeks, all glowing. We owe the generous vine A pledge of best old wine, And clustering ivy's twine, And flowers new blowing. Pluck, pluck the autumn flowers, And deftly twine them;— Maidens, in lonely hours, May then divine them: One, with its eye of blue, Shall tell the heart is true; Another, blushing new, Softly incline them. Then wheel the dance, the dance, Around the fountain;— The satyrs hear, and prance On ivied mountain; The fauns come stealing nigh, And roll the roguish eye, Quick mischief in it:— Back to your craggy wood! The maiden's heart is good; Ye cannot win it. SONG. Long years have seen me roaming A sad and weary way, Like traveller tired at gloaming, A sultry summer's day; No lamp of love before me, No twinkling parlor fire, But clouds and darkness o'er me, My only friend my lyre. A welcome shed now greets me, Though low its portal be, And ready kindness meets me, And peace that will not flee: So here my heart reposes, And finds at last its home; Its day of wandering closes; It rests, no more to roam. So when, by tempest battered, The seaman, bent ashore, Sails torn and colors tattered, Still ploughs the ocean's roar, If but a watch-light twinkle With hospitable glow, Joy-tears his hard cheeks sprinkle, And hope's bright fountains flow: His home is all before him, The dwelling of his sires; His own blue sky is o'er him, And near his altar-fires: Awhile his burdened feelings Like silent waters run, Then burst in echoed pealings, “My land—my land is won!” SONG. Strike, strike the note of sorrow, That late so moved me! My sinking heart would borrow, From sounds so passing sweet, Fond moments once so fleet Beside the youth who loved me. O, set the music flowing! My soul for ever Could dwell on words so glowing, On sounds so soft and clear, To all my heart so dear, They can be silent never. Give me the lute,—the lute, For I would ring it! O, breathe that Spartan flute, And wake my languid soul, Till, loosed from earth's control, Heaven's fire shall wing it! No! touch the chord of feeling, And lightly wake it! And as I hear, come stealing From out my bleeding heart Tears, such as woes impart:— Be still, or else ye break it. TO A BUTTERFLY. Thou, who in the early spring Hoverest on filmy wing, Visiting the bright-eyed flowers, Fluttering in loaded bowers, Settling on the reddening rose, Reddening ere it fully blows, When its crisp and folded leaves Just unroll their dewy tips, Soft as infant beauty's lips, Or anything that love believes,— Little wanderer after pleasure, Where is that enchanted treasure, All that live are seeking for? Is it in the blossom, or Where we seek it, in the roses Of a maiden's cheek, or rather In the many lights that gather When her smiling lip uncloses? Wouldst thou rather kiss a flower, When 't is drooping with a shower, Or with trembling, quivering wing Rest thee on a dearer thing, On a lip that has no stain, On a brow that feels no pain, In the beamings of an eye, Where a world of visions lie, Such as to the blest are given, All of heaven,—all of heaven? If thou lovest the blossom, I Love the cheek, the lip and eye. THE VOICE OF NATURE. A voice is heard in the winds and waves, In the sound of the ever-rolling sea; 'T is whispered amid the gloom of graves, And it speaks from the hill-top loud and free: 'T is murmuring in every breath of air, And it pauses not when the leaves are still; Where the waters are falling, it prattles there, And it whistles along the heathery hill. Up on the brown and briery steep, When the bramble stirs with the nestling bird, Down in the green and glassy deep, When the coral rustles, that voice is heard: Far it is borne on the summer breeze, O'er sunny meadow and flowery plain; Then it steals to the glancing trees, And is lost in their shadowy gloom again. Hark! its wandering echoes wake;— They are now in the heart of the rifted rock; Now they lie on the slumbering lake; Now are at play with the bounding flock. Not a withering leaf by the wind is stirred. Not a murmur moves through the bending corn, But far that summoning voice is heard, Like the loud, clear notes of the winding horn. O, 't is a voice that comes from Heaven, Borne like a spirit in light along, Now like the rush of a tempest driven, Murmuring now in the charm of song. Hear ye the voice?—then come away Far from the haunts of ruder men,— Come, where the leaves and fountains play;— You may love and be happy then. SONG. Ye come to me with eyes of light, Fair creatures of my dreams! Ye move around me, calm and bright, Like sunset over streams, When the last flush of dying day In liquid lustre glows, Then passes into night away, Like rain-drops from a rose. Fair creatures! soft your voices are: I hear their tender tone, And all the twilight echoes bear Their melody alone. It fills the rocks, the woods, the plain, With an all-pervading thrill; And, listening to the invisible strain, The breathless air is still. All innocent your beauty blows,— 'T is bright and purely fair: The rose, the young and virgin rose, Buds forth in sweetness there; And there are light and laughing eyes, That never have wept in pain,— Hope beckons you on, as away she flies, And love, that must all be vain. O, stay, fair creatures,—I bid you stay! With you my dreams are heaven. Too soon the vision must fade away; Not for ever those joys were given. Bend over me now that winning smile, That lingering look of light! Ye fade:—O, pause and charm awhile, Ere ye vanish away in night! SONG. O, sing to me one song of thine, One song before we part, That I may bear away with me Its music in my heart. Let it be a gentle one, A song of early joy, Such as a fair-haired maiden sings To win her much-loved boy. O, sing to me the song I heard, The other day, at noon, When it came to me like a warbling bird, And ceased as short and soon. Bashfully that song was still, For I started from out the trees; So the bird is hush, when the bramble-bush Stirs with the passing breeze. Turn not so tearfully away,— I cannot bear to part, With anything but hope and joy In the swelling of my heart. Look up to me with laughing eyes,— We shall meet again erelong; And then the greeting I shall have Will be thy gentle song. So sing to me that song of joy, That song of summer bowers, Murmuring like the soft, warm breath Of a south-wind over flowers. I will kiss thee as thou warblest on, My token as I part, And so will bear away with me Thy music in my heart. SAPPHO. She stands in act to fall;—her garland torn, Its withered rose-leaves round the rock are blowing; Loose to the winds her locks dishevelled flowing, Tell of the many sorrows she has borne. Her eye, up-turned to heaven, has lost its fire;— One hand is pressed to feel her bosom beating, And mark her lingering pulses back retreating, The other wanders o'er her silent lyre. Clear rolls the midway sun,—she knows it not; Vainly the winds waft by the flower's perfume; To her the sky is hung in deepest gloom,— She only feels the noon-beam burning hot. What to the broken heart the dancing waves, The air all kindling,—what a sounding name? O, what a mockery, to dream of fame! It only lures us on to make us slaves. And Love,—O, what art thou with all thy light? Ineffable joy is round thee, till we know Thou art but as a vision of the night;— And then the bursting heart, how deep its woe! “They tell me I shall live,—my name shall rise When nature falls;—O, blest illusion, stay!” A moment hopes and joys around her play; Then darkness hides her,—faint she sinks and dies. SONNETS. [I. O, there are moments, when the dreaming soul] O, there are moments, when the dreaming soul Forgets this earth, and wanders far away Into some region of eternal day, Where the bright waves in calm and sunshine roll. Thither it wanders, and has reached its goal;— The good, the great, the beautiful are there, And wreaths of victory crown their flowing hair, And as they move, such music fills the air, As ne'er from fabled bower or cavern stole. Soft to the heart it winds, and hushes deep Its cares and sorrows. Thought then, fancy-free, Flies on from bliss to bliss, till finding thee It pauses, as the musk-rose charms the bee, Tranced, as in happy dream of magic sleep. [II. O Evening! I have loved thee with a joy] O Evening! I have loved thee with a joy Tender and pure, and thou hast ever been A soother of my sorrows. When a boy, I wandered often to a lonely glen, And, far from all the stir and noise of men, Held fond communion with unearthly things, Such as come gathering brightly round us, when Imagination soars and shakes her wings. Yes, in that secret valley, doubly dear For all its natural beauty, and the hush That ever brooded o'er it, I would lay My thoughts in deepest calm, and if a bush Rustled, or small bird shook the beechen spray, There seemed a ministering angel whispering near. [III. O, there are tears of joy, and they are fed] O, there are tears of joy, and they are fed From the heart's secret fountain, where they well Like springs in some mysterious cavern's bed, Made holy by the sibyl's murmuring spell. Forth from the darkling cave they calmly flow, Crystalline pure, to heaven's rejoicing light, And over sifted sands and pebbles bright, Down through the sacred grove of laurels go. So when my thoughts, long wearied by the rush Of life's too busy cares, would pause and keep Awhile a sabbath's stillness, and would lay Each passionate longing, then I can but weep Tears, happy tears, in many a sudden gush, And with them all my sorrows melt away. [IV. O would that dreams were not the things they are] O would that dreams were not the things they are, Mere unsubstantial pageants, born and dying With the light sleep that makes them, coming, flying, Like evening clouds, how beautiful and fair. O, they are thinner than the empty air, And yet how blessed, when they bend and smile How the heart flows away in rapture, while, Dear fond illusions, they are lingering there! They have a touch and voice. That bosom, swelling With a young world of joys, how softly heaves: It lifts its gauzy veil, like feathery leaves Waved lightly over Yemen's palmy dwelling, A higher bliss than even hope believes, To the fixed eye of slumbering fondness telling. [V. Shadows of hoary forests, solemn haunts] Shadows of hoary forests, solemn haunts Of wild, unearthly glooms! O, I would be A dweller in your darkness, and to me There I would find all that the spirit pants To reach of boundless thoughts. Ye are the fane To mightiest musings sacred,—to the sweep Of visions dim but high, emotions deep, Such as in breathless rest till then had lain. Then go they forth, and, from the flowery vale Of life's too joyous spring, among the storms Launch their unfettered wings, till giant forms, Born of the tempest, round them fold a veil Of awe and lifting wonder. Such the flight Of the waked spirit, when the world is night. [VI. My soul goes often wandering to your glooms] My soul goes often wandering to your glooms, And rests beneath your shadow,—often dwells My spirit in your silence, often tells Over your opening glades their mingled blooms. How, like a vein of silver, steals along The mountain brook 'mid ferns and brakes and flowers; And how, when all is still in calmer hours, Comes floating o'er the hills some artless song! Low lies yon narrow vale, and there it strays, The truant stream, to either wooded steep, As if to kiss its mossy foot, and plays Now over pebbly shallows, and now deep Rests in a sheeted pool, while opening through The wide plain melts in soft and shadowy blue. [VII. Am I not all alone? The world is still] Am I not all alone? The world is still In passionless slumber;—not a tree but feels The far pervading hush, and softer steals The misty river by. Yon broad, bare hill Looks coldly up to heaven, and all the stars Seem eyes deep fixed in silence, as if bound By some unearthly spell;—no other sound But the owl's unfrequent moan. Their airy cars The winds have stationed on the mountain peaks. Am I not all alone?—A spirit speaks From the abyss of night, “Not all alone,— Nature is round thee with her banded powers, And ancient genius haunts thee in these hours;— Mind and its kingdom now are all thine own.” [VIII. Deep sunk in thought, he sat beside the river] Deep sunk in thought, he sat beside the river,— Its wave in liquid lapses glided by, Nor watched, in crystal depth, his vacant eye The willow's high o'er-arching foliage quiver. From dream to shadowy dream returning ever, He sat, like statue, on the grassy verge; His thoughts, a phantom train, in airy surge Streamed visionary onward, pausing never. As autumn wind, in mountain forest weaving Its wondrous tapestry of leaf and bower, O'ermastering the night's resplendent flower, With tints, like hues of heaven, the eye deceiving,— So, lost in labyrinthine maze, he wove A wreath of flowers; the golden thread was love. [IX. Whence? Whither? Where?—A taper point of light] Whence? Whither? Where?—A taper point of light, My life and world,—the infinite around; A sea, not even highest thought can sound; A formless void; unchanging, endless night. In vain the struggling spirit aims its flight To the empyrean, seen as is a star, Sole glimmering through the hazy night afar,— In vain it beats its wings with daring might. What yonder gleams? What heavenly shapes arise From out the bodiless waste? Behold the dawn, Sent from on high! Uncounted ages gone, Burst full and glorious on my wondering eyes: Sun-clear the world around, and far away A boundless future sweeps in golden day. THE CONTRAST. To his gallant horse the warrior sprung,— They called, but he would not stay; And the hoof of his hurrying charger rung, As to battle he rushed away. She stood aloft on the warder's tower, And she followed him over the plain, And she watched through many a silent hour, But she heard not his tramp again. They came, when the morning was cold and pale, With a warrior on his bier, And his banner, rent like a tattered sail, Showed he died not the death of fear. They brought him in pride and sorrow back To the home he had left so gay, When he gallantly flew on glory's track, And to battle rushed away. BALLAD. “Whither away, in thy swift-winged bark, Over the waters blue?” “The way is long, and the night is dark, And before the song of the matin lark My voyage must be through. “On Clutha's rock a castle tall Frowns over the waters blue. My lord, within that castle tall, In deadly peril holds his all; And my life to my lord is due. “I have twenty stout and stalwart men, As ever tugged at yew. You may search the land, nor find again Twenty such stout and stalwart men, Nor twenty hearts so true. “And every man, by his trusty side, Has a falchion keen and new; And with blades so keen and hearts so tried, Their way to their lord they would soon divide A host of leaguers through. “And hosts of leaguers throng around My lord and his vassals few; And where shall his valiant liege be found, Who would not stand his inch of ground, To his lord and his honor true? “Many long months they have stood at bay, With sword and spear and yew; And the few the leaguers could not slay, Famine and toil have thinned away,— But firm that noble few. “To lend our lives to a lord so brave, We skim the waters blue; And we would hurry us over the wave, That noble few to reach and save, Though a raging whirlwind blew. “The wave curls high, and its top is white As the plume of the wild sea-mew; And the bark cuts swift as an arrow's flight, And its way is like the track of light, Where the falling meteor flew. “Though dark the night, and the wind blow strong As ever tempest blew, To Clutha's rock we scud along, And cheer our way with tale and song Of the fearless heart and true. “Then away, away, in my swift-winged bark, Over the waters blue;— The way is long, and the night is dark, And before the song of the matin lark My voyage must be through.” SONGS. [I. O Guadalaxara!] O Guadalaxara! Thy beautiful river Is rolling on ever Its waters so clear. O Guadalaxara! Thy evergreens, bending Their wide boughs, are lending A shadow, how dear. O Guadalaxara! Thy current is flowing, Like gales softly blowing, Or flutes breathing near. The town of Pesara Stands brightly beside thee, And gay galleys ride thee, O Guadalaxara! [II. Murmuring river] Murmuring river, Falling ever, And silent never, Thou hurriest by. Now softly flowing, And brightly glowing, And clearly showing, Thy waters lie. Through meadows bending, Sweet flowers are sending Their breath, and lending Thy wave perfume. The myrtle covers Thy banks, and lovers, As evening hovers, Are in its gloom. And lilies, swelling With dew, and smelling Of morn, are telling Their leaves below. No fairest flower, In bush or bower, So takes the shower, And scents it so. Dark eyes are flashing, And fair hands dashing Thy foam, and plashing The bubbles fly. So, murmuring river, Falling ever, And silent never, Thou hurriest by. [III. Music and dances] Music and dances, Smiles and bright glances, Love's happy chances, All are at play. Youths with gay sashes, Girls with calashes, Quick as light flashes, Foot it away. Viols are tinkling, Light feet are twinkling, Snowy veils crinkling, Round as they go. Soft voices prattle, Castanets rattle, Love's mimic battle Mingles them so. Now the dance closes,— Baskets of roses, Woven in posies, Gayly they twine. Goblets are clashing, Amber lights flashing, Young lovers dashing Beauty in wine. All now is over,— White mantles hover, Each with a lover, Back to the town. None of them misses Sweetest of blisses, Dewy wet kisses,— That is love's crown. GREEK APPEAL TO AMERICA. 1827. Rouse ye at a nation's call,— Rouse, and rescue, one and all! Help, or liberty shall fall, Fall in blood and shame! Shame to him who coldly draws Backward from the noblest cause! Not to him who fights and fa's,— His a glorious name. Sons of more than mortal sires, We have lit again their fires, Or to be our funeral pyres, Or our sun of fame. Hear ye not the widow's cry? “Help us, or we faint and die: See! the murderous foe is nigh,— Hark, the wasting flame! “Whither shall we fly for aid? Where is now the warrior's blade? Low the mighty heart is laid, Death alone could tame. “To the mountain, to the cave, Let us go, and weep the brave;— Better die than live a slave,— Better death than shame!” No,—forbid it, chosen land! Open wide thy helping hand,— Pour thy corn and wine, like sand;— What is wealth to fame! Quick, before the flame expire,— Feed, O, feed the holy fire! Feed, and it shall kindle higher,— Win a generous name! OUR FLAG. Lift, lift the eagle banner high, Our guide to fame;— On ocean's breezes bid it fly, Like meteors wafting through the sky Their pomp of flame, Till, wide on every sea unfurled, It tell to an admiring world Our name. O, proudly burns its beacon light On victory's path! Thro' freedom's dawn, thro' danger's night, Onward, still onward, rolling bright, It swept in wrath;— Still lightning-like, to him who dares Confront the terror of our stars, Its scath. Still heavenward mounts the generous flame, And never tires:— Does Envy dare insult our name, Or lurking Falsehood brand with shame Our buried sires? The armed Colossus thunders by, Wide wave our stripes,—the dastard lie Expires. SPRING. Low breathed the western wind at close of day; The bloomy shrubs were bent with heavy showers; The clouds had hardly rolled their wreaths away, They darkly hung, where high the mountain towers; Through flowery vale, the dashing stream Leaped sparklingly, in many a fall; And evening's rosy beam Tinted the forest tall. The loving birds were emulous in song; The cattle lowed; on slope of sunny hill Sported the lambs, and wildly raced along The turf that bore its beaded treasures still; And as they swept, a shower of light Flew round, like gems that deck the snow, When morning glances bright On hill and valley flow. And gleaming o'er a wood-embowered lake, Floated 'mid dreamy haze the golden ray; The rippling wave, in many a yellow flake, Curled round the dewy rock, and slid away: In rustic boat, his dipping oars Attuned to song the peasant-boy; Gliding by happy shores, He felt the season's joy. By willowy isle, with silvery catkins bowed, He skimmed the sheeted gold; and on my ear Echoed his song, now sweetly low, now loud As when the patriot ode is swelling near. From rock to rock the music rung; By wooded hill it died along: Light was the heart that sung That wild and woodland song. “The buds are now unfolding, And gayly swings the vine; In woods the birds are holding Their merry valentine; On hill, in meadow waking, Peep out the blue-eyed flowers: And forest-leaves are making A shade for summer hours: And why should not my heart be gay, When all the world is now at play? “And every heart is beating, Is beating full with love; Advancing, now retreating, How gently woos the dove! On topmost bough high swinging,— Ah, there is none so gay! So clear his voice is ringing, As merry thrush to-day: And I will merrily sing my song, As o'er the lake I skim along.” YOUTH RECALLED. In deepest shade, by fountain sparkling clear, High o'er me, darkly heaved, the forest dome, Sweet tones, long silent, melt upon my ear,— They soothe my spirit like the voice of home; And, blended with them, floats a beam of light, Radiant, but gentle, through the shadowy night. My heart, that sunk in dim, oblivious dream, Wakes at the tones, and feels its life again; My downcast eye uprises to the beam; Softly untwines my bosom's heavy chain: A stream of melody around me flows; Anew the smothered fire of feeling glows. The charm, long lost, is found, and gushing pours, From fancy's heaven, its beauty, as a shower; The mystic deep casts up its wondrous stores; Mind stands in panoply of fullest power. Heaving with wakened purpose, swells the soul Its barriers fall; its gathered treasures roll. Light covers all around,—light from on high, Soft as the last retiring tint of even, Full as the glow that fills the morning sky, Pure as the midmost blue of cloudless heaven: Like pillared bronze the lofty trunks aspire, And every leaf above is tipped with fire. And round me still the magic music flows; A thousand different tones dissolve in one: Softer than ever gale of evening blows, They blend in harmony's enchanted zone. With pictured web and golden fringe they bind, For higher flight, the renovated mind. I feel it round me twine,—the band of power; Youth beats in every vein; life bursts in bloom: All seems as when, at twilight's blissful hour, Breathed from the flowery grove the gale's perfume; The laugh, the shout, the dance,—and then the strain Of tenderest love dissolved the heart again. Ye greet me fair, ye years of hope and joy, Ye days of trembling fears and ardent loves, The reeling madness of the impassioned boy;— Through wizard wilds again my spirit roves, And beauty, veiled in fancy's heavenly hue, Smiles and recedes before my longing view. The light has fled; the tones that won my heart Back to its early heaven, again are still: A deeper darkness broods,—with sudden start Repelled, my life relapses from its thrill: Heavier the shades descend, and on my ear Only the bubbling fountain murmurs near. A VISION. “Whence dost thou come to me, Sweetest of visions, Filling my slumbers with holiest joy?” “Kindly I bring to thee Feelings of childhood, That in thy dreams thou be happy awhile.” “Why dost thou steal from me Ever as slumber Flies, and reality chills me again?” “Life thou must struggle through: Strive,—and in slumber Sweetly again I will steal to thy soul.” THE POET'S WORLD. Bright World! too beautiful for human eye, Creation of poetic thought, in vain I seek thee here. Thou bendest far away Thy airy orbit. Thine are other suns, And other stars,—a brightness all thy own, A day self-lighted, and thy magic night Is but a veil o'er day. I seek thee here, When morning lights the east, and tips with gems Deep set in waving gold, high mountain-peak, Then tower and tree, and over field and grove Pours out a flood of pearls, and sheets the sea With liquid flame;—I seek thee, when at noon High on his throne, the visible lord of light Rides in his fullest blaze, and dashes wide Thick flashes from his wheels;—I seek thee, too, When twilight shades the meadow, and the hills Alone are lighted,—when the sky above Smiles with a fading beauty, and below Uncertain floats the plain,—nor less when night, Clad in her sable robe, sits silently Above the slumbering earth, and through the vast, Immeasurable darkness, shadowy forms Unbidden come and go;—I seek thee here, And yet I find thee not. In all its change Of time and season,—all its shifting scenes Of sun and storm,—of life new bursting forth In blossomy spring, vigorous in manly pride, Or ripe for harvest,—all of high and bright, Deep and obscure,—the clear, expanded arch Broad sweeping o'er us, or with pictured wreaths Hung festively at dawn, or heaving forth Black, billowy mountains, like a chain of Alps Uplifted into heaven,—wide forest glooms Far stretching into night, and yawning caves Where the void infinite opens,—still retreats Low under sheltering woods, and shady banks Hollowed in coves, where fountains welling out Freshen the turf and flowers;—in all its change Earth holds thee not. Thine is a fuller growth Of beauty,—thine the genial life that springs From the o'erteeming mind, and heightens all That even here seems glorious. Man, who walks In dignity and grace,—heroic pride, Or yielding loveliness,—earth's angel erst, Radiant and pure,—now sad and dimly fair, Even when brightest,—Man is but the shade Of thy Humanity,—such heavenly forms, As float amid the stars, and dwell enthroned In light unstained. Thou risest to the eye Of solitary thought, as from the depths Of mountain valleys, when the level ray First paints the aerial rose, uprolling clouds Swell into towering peaks, and glitter bright With all the glow of dawn,—intenser far In brightness,—more magnificent and vast In thy extension, and thy several hues And shapes purer and fairer. Mind in thee Reveals its heavenly spring,—in thee it tells Its godlike birth,—not from the trivial play Of blended atoms, but a spiritual flame Warming and kindling into higher life Our perishable frames, here poor and weak, The creatures of decay, obscuring oft Its living beams, and even in dim eclipse Quenching its orb,—and yet the eye within Still gazes on thee, through the gathered mist Of evil passions, sees thee rolling free In thy unclouded track, and at the sight Hope springs and hurries to thee. MINNESONG. I. “In dem walde süze döne Singent kleiniu vogellin; An der heide blümen schöne Blüjent gein des Meien schin.”— Liehtenstein. “In the wood the little birdis Warble sweet their roundelay; On the heath the pretty flouris Blossom in the sheen of May.” May has come:—the woods are ringing; Clearer sounds the hunter's horn; Birds in every brake are singing; Yellow-green the springing corn. May has come:—in field and meadow Starry bloom the virgin flowers; Broad the maple flings its shadow; Snowy white the elder bowers. Green the slope of yonder mountain, Mellowed to a golden glow; Under feathery birch, the fountain Sparkles in its gurgling flow. Orchards redden,—crimson blushes Tremble o'er the apple-boughs; There her young the robin hushes, Still beside her trilling spouse. Joy, on glittering pinions driven, Gayly flits around, above; Glancing, kindles earth and heaven;— All is life and light and love. II. “Ir wangen wurden rot, Sam diu rose, da si bi den lilien stat.”— Vogelweide. “Her cheeks grew red as the rose, That by the lily blows.” “Take this garland for thy golden hair,”— So I spake unto a maiden fair, Maid with eyes of love, like heaven's own blue, Thinnest veil of cloud soft shining through;— “Take this garland,—'t is of earliest bloom, Newly plucked, and filled with fresh perfume. Had I jewel rare, and precious stone, Gems of Ind, O, they were thine alone; Costliest gift for thee were all too poor;— Take this garland,—I can give no more. Fairer flowers than these indeed I know; On the lonely heath afar they blow: There the violet peeps beside the spring, Coyly peeps, as loving linnets sing;— Go with me, and we will gather there Fairer, sweeter flowers to wreathe thy hair.” Bashfully the maid the garland took; Like rewarded child, she blushed and shook: Clearest red her cheek, as when the rose, Dewy sheen, behind the lily blows. Low she bowed, and love-looks sparkled clear, Under silken lashes, through a tear: That was my reward;—O, there was one, Holier far, my lips shall breathe to none. III. “Vor dem walde, in einem tal, Schone sank diu nahtegal.”— Vogelweide. “'Fore the wood, and in a dale, Lovely sang the nightingale.” Under the willow, in a meadow, Where the brook was running clear, There was my pillow, dark in shadow, Blossom and verdure springing near. 'Fore the wood, and in a dale, Lovely sang the nightingale. Silent reclining the willow under, Just as evening faded away, Sweetly shining, a heavenly wonder Bent over me, as there I lay: Light her form; her face was pale;— Lovely sang the nightingale. Nymph of fountain, in dewy brightness Rising from wave in vest of green; Dryad of mountain, with airy lightness Flitting around the huntress queen;— All to that heavenly form must veil, Smiling as sang the nightingale. Then she addressed me,—“O, why dost linger Here in a world that chains thy will?” Softly she pressed me with snowy finger; Pulse and beating heart were still. Lovely sang, in the lonely dale, Fainter and fainter, the nightingale. THE KNIGHT. “Was er trug von eysen an Das were wiser als ein Swan Sein Waffenrock gab lichten schin. “Di clare süsse reine Di werde ussekorne Di edelhochgeborne Eyn vil hercelibes wip.”— Rudolff. “What he had of iron on, That was whiter than a swan; Light and bright his armor shone. “The bright, sweet, pure, The worthy chosen, The nobly high-born, A wife to heart most dear.” Who yonder rides through wind and rain, With plumed helm and shield and spear? How fleet he dashes o'er the plain! The distant shelter soon is near. With bearing bold he scours along; He bends with practised hand the rein: From clash of arms and battle throng, To wife and home he turns again. He who so proudly speeds afar Is the famed champion, Adhemar. On gallant steed, in armor bright, To serve his king he rode to war: Erect he moved in burnished light; 'Mid crowds his helmet shone, a star. He couched his lance; he burst away; His gallop thundered o'er the field: In dust the bleeding foeman lay; Unhurt by splintered lance his shield. He drew his flashing blade,—and wide Rolled startled back the warrior tide. The victory won, with glory crowned, To wife and home, as country, true, As praise and blessing echoed round, Back to that wife and home he flew. Loud bursts the storm; the river swells; He dashes through the roaring wave: Nor field nor flood his spirit quells,— Life has no terrors for the brave. And now across that sweep of plain, See, see! the gallant champion strain. She gazes from the highest tower;— The night is dark; the wind is chill. Through midnight's wildest, dreariest hour, With sleepless eye she gazes still. The bright, the pure, the chosen one, Of noblest dames the fairest star, In worth, in loveliness, alone, Through night and storm, sat watching there. Hark, yonder horn! He comes!—she springs, And flies, as if her feet were wings. She draws the bolt; the ponderous gate Rolls back, as from a giant's hand: Quick falls the bridge,—she cannot wait; Love draws her forth with magic band. Tramp! tramp!—her Adhemar is near, And now she sees his armor bright,— His eager welcome meets her ear; He comes,—he springs,—she clasps her knight. What cares he for the wind or rain? He holds his Ylia again. LIFE'S DREAM. “Ach! dürften wir mit Trämen nicht Die Wirklichkeit verweben, Wie arm an Farbe, Glanz und Licht Wärst dann du Menschenleben?”— A. W. Schlegel. “Ah! could we not entwine Reality with dreams, How poor in color, glow, and light Wert thou then, Human Life?” “Wer trüge Lebenslast und seine Leere, Wenn nicht der kurze Traum der Liebe wäre?”— Meyer. “Who would bear the burden and emptiness of life, if the short dream of love were not?” “Des Lebens Traum verschwindet, Mit ihm des Lebens Glück.”— Ernst B?sch?. “Life's dream disappears,—with it, life's bliss.” Light and bright the vision plays, Like the evening's fitful blaze Over meadow careering along. Fairy phantoms hover; blossoms strow Thick the verdure, as with snow; Breathes the elfin's magical song. Fair the moon in azure floats, Bending o'er the enchanting notes, As if longing to glide from her sphere: White wings faintly quiver; near and far Glow-worm twinkles back to star, Lighting a softer galaxy here. Sweet by sparkling fountain sings, Sweet and clear, as tone that rings Pure from Harmony's crystalline throne,— Sweetly sings a spirit; still the air Drinks the song,—its pulses bear Far through the night the heavenly tone. Peering quick from shadowy glades, Glancing back to deeper shades, Forms too bright and beautiful play: Gentle voices whisper; snowy doves Circle forth, as sent by loves,— Wheel then on fanning pinions away. Quick steps hurry to my side; Round my heart soft touches glide, Wreathing fetters of lily and rose. Viewless forms embrace me; whispers say, “Press the joys,—not long they stay: Comes like a stream the pleasure, and flows.” Sweetly dim the trance of love: As through veil of roses wove, Steals its purple light to the soul. Break the magic slumber,—cold and bare, Waste and dark, life meets us there: Break the dream,—thou hast withered the whole! THE HEXLI. (LITTLE WITCH.) “I lauf no alli Dörfer us, i such und frog vo Hus zu Hus, und würd mer nit mi Hexli chund, se würdi ebe nümme g'sund.”— Hebel. “I run through all the villages, I seek and ask from house to house, And if I do not find my Hexli, Then I shall never be well.” I whittled at a stick one day,— 'T was just to pass the time away: A little girl came tripping by, With rosy look and witching eye. With artless smile and simple grace, She loooked me sweetly in my face, And said, “That knife is sharp, I ween,— Another thing will cut as keen.” And then she laughed, and said, “Good-day,” And like a dream had flown away; The voice, the look, was with me still, When all at once I felt me ill. I could not work, I could not play; I saw and heard her all the day. That witching eye was sharp, I ween; O, that was what would cut so keen. I saw and heard her day and night,— Her voice so soft, her eye so bright: When others lay in slumber sweet, I heard the clock each hour repeat I could not stay and linger so: Like one entranced, away I go; Through field and forest, far and wide, I seek if there the witch doth hide. By bush and brake, by rock and hill, Where'er I go, I see her still: The little girl, with witching eye, Is ever, ever tripping by. Through town and village, too, I stray; At every house I call and say, “O, can you tell me where to find The little girl that witched my mind?” I 've sought her many a weary mile; Methought I saw her all the while: Ah! if I can't the witch obtain, I never shall be well again. THE MAIDEN. “Ein schlichtes Mädchen nur, Einfach und treu dem angebohrnen Stande, War seine Welt diess Thal.”— Schink. “Only a modest maiden, Simple, and faithful to her native manners, Was all her world this vale.” “Solch einen Geist, in einem solchen Blicke, Zeigt nur dein Lächeln uns.”— Von Friedelberg. “Such a soul, in such a look, Thy smile alone reveals us.” Through a valley flows a gentle river, Gently flows, with waters deep and clear; In a flowery meadow, spreading near, Silken leaves of slender poplars quiver. There a quiet maiden singeth ever Simple melodies of truth and love: Pure and artless as the snowy dove, Evil thought hath stained her bosom never. Lovely, too, as rose but half unfolded; Modest as that rose, when bent with dew: Blue her eye, as heaven's own softest hue; Lip as fresh as living ruby moulded. Smiles she hath that tell of sunny feeling,— Only smiles like hers such feeling tell; Touch the chord of grief, and at the spell, Tears of love and innocence are stealing. Home and parent, kindred, friend and lover, All embraced within this lonely vale,— All beyond is to her but a tale: This her world, and heaven just arches over. THE POWER OF SONG. “Sângen innehar all lifvets lycka.”— Hedborn. “The bliss of life is all in song.” “Zatichli vieterki, zamolkli pticzek chory, I prilegli stada.”— Krilov. “Still became the winds, silent the choirs of birds, and side by side the flocks reclined.” “Og dets betydningsrige toner svæved' Melodisk giennem Seclets storme hen, Men ak!—som Æolsharpens harmonier, Tidt overdövede afhule vindstöd, Dog aldrig qvalte.”— Pram. “And away its full-meaning tones floated melodiously through the storms of time, but ah! like the harmonies of the Æolian harp, often drowned by the hollow blast, yet never stifled.” In the temple stands the golden lyre, Near the presence of the genial power; Round it plays an orb of holiest fire;— So it stands, and waits the inspiring hour. Rolls the sun unto his highest throne; Broad he fills the temple's vaulted shade: Touched by hands unseen, in solemn tone, Rings the harp,—the winds are laid. Slow and full they swell,—the mystic chords; Stillness, more than awful, fills the air: Mingled with the tones, sublimest words High the listening soul, in glory, bear. Light is all around him; light and love, As on wings, aloft the listener raise: Ever wider heaves the arch above; Fairer beauty round him plays. Now they swell, the tones, and swells the breast, Kindled with the bliss of great design: Faint the music whispers; hushed to rest, Couched on flowers, the passions all recline: Clear the harp resounds; the spirit's eye Keenest glance through nature's wonders throws: Tenderer touches glide, and silently Blest the tear of feeling flows. How hushed the winds! how calm the air! The leaf is still on bush and tree; No blossom shakes, and quietly The herd and flock are resting there. They feel the soothing power of song; A stream of love, it flows along;— The winds are still; the sky is fair. By magic shores the vessel glides; Entranced by song, the waves are laid: Visions of home, forgotten, fade; In peace the storm-beat wanderer rides. Smooth sleeps the sea; serenest day Smiles o'er the ocean far away: The power of song has hushed the tides. Pale in the west the glow decays, That late arose in golden fire; Waked by the touch of soft desire, Through twilight shades the music plays. In darkened vale its pulses thrill; Peace broods above the glimmering hill; His flight the fleeting moment stays. It comes—the storm, so long repelled, In wilder rage again; Like wintry stream, by barrier swelled, Loud bursts it o'er the plain: With gathered might it sweeps along; Like thunder, peals its roar: The Æolian melodies of song Are lost, amid the wildering throng; The lyre is heard no more. A moment's pause the tempest feels, And soft the heavenly tone, As evening hymn from cottage steals, Breathes sweetly faint and lone. Uncertain, as if thrilled with fear, It melts and dies away: I turn, and wait with longing ear, And low and dim it rises near, Quick falls,—it cannot stay. Serene and calm the world of song, Above the cloud and gale: There flows a sheeted stream along, Through many a silent vale: There ever blue the sunny sky; Spring-warm the wooing air: White filmy wreaths of beauty lie, Alone, in holiest rest, on high;— Love dwells for ever there. LAYS. [I. Mellow fades the glow of even] Mellow fades the glow of even; Cool the shadow round the spring: Clouds, by Autumn breezes driven, Stream along the amber heaven, Bright and clear as spirit's wing. From the holy shrine of feeling, Kindled by departing day, Blessed visions flit away,— Through the pictured forest stealing, Round the magic mountain play. Melting with the blue afar, Lightly tipped with golden flame, Flashing like the regal star, Sky-o'ercrowned, ascends the car, Bent around the course of fame. Far it sweeps in dazzling light; Fire-winged coursers urge the wheel; Echoes wide the ringing steel:— Who can tell the full delight, Tell the joy the champions feel? Soft its dreamy shade diffusing, Twilight streams athwart the grove, Fills the soul with silent musing, Till in devious trances losing All its thoughts, it sinks in love. Soft and still as moonlit ocean, Silver-mirrored, deep and clear, Hidden music pulsing near, Glides it, with unconscious motion, Far away to holier sphere. Startled by the instant flash, Breaks the flower-enwoven dream;— Thunder rends with deadening crash; Winds the mingling branches lash; Bursts the storm, like wintry stream. Where is now the musing soul? Nerved to meet the raging war, Stern it mounts its iron car: Swift the crushing chariots roll, Fierce his steeds the warrior bear. Far away the pausing thunder Echoes from remotest hill; Faint the rain-drop patters under Loaded leaves that bend asunder, As with trickling streams they fill. So the still, small voice of feeling, 'Mid the din of inward strife, To the heart with passion rife, Mild as zephyr whispers healing, Breathes, and wakes the soul to life. [II. Hark! the song] Hark! the song Floats along, Clearly swelling, softly dying, Soft as wind in roses sighing. O'er the plain Sweeps again Sudden burst of hope and gladness,— Trembles then the trill of sadness. Rock and hill Give it still, Bright and clear, the sweet emotion,— Deep and full, the heart's devotion. Shadows fall,— Voices call Fondly home the truant, straying Down the brook in eddies playing. Daylight flies,— Amber skies, O'er the shadowy mountain glowing, Darken; yet the song is flowing. [III. Through the wood, in evening's shadow, straying] Through the wood, in evening's shadow, straying; O'er me arched the boughs, in silent gloom; Deep in dreamy vision, long delaying, Fades to night the day's departing bloom. Fades the skyey rose, that over mountain Blossomed wide and full in fields of air,— Bloomed in heaven aloft, and low in fountain Shone in softer tints, as pure and fair. Darkness veils me round, and voices, gliding Through the murmuring foliage, seem to say: “Pause, and listen to the spirit's chiding,— Haste, O, haste to brighter worlds away! “Mark the last, soft tint of day, receding O'er the top of yonder solemn pine! So departs the lingering spirit, leading To yon purer day's eternal shine. “There await thee all thy heart has cherished; There the early loved, the hoped and gone: Not a treasure of thy heart has perished,— All to yonder world of rest have flown.” [IV. Speed thee far] Speed thee far,— Fancy lends thee her car;— Over ocean away Speed to holier day. Ocean's swell Bears on its bosom the shell; Love shall open the sail Full to the favoring gale. Wing of might, Sent from the fountain of light, High on billows of air Thee, in triumph, shall bear. Youth shall bring Wine from perennial spring,— Over the goblet shall shine Halo of glory divine. Round the throne, Beauty shall loosen her zone;— Melting in kindling shower, Spirit shall fill thee with power. [V. O that I lay on yonder mountain] O that I lay on yonder mountain, So blue and fair,— In shade of rock, by gushing fountain, Aloft in air. The cloud and storm might swell below me, The thunder roll,— Yet waves of light should overflow me, And warm my soul; And peace, unbroken peace, for ever Around me play; And thought, serene and calm, be never Compelled away; And blush of dawn, and rose of even, My heart should fill Oft with the loveliness of heaven, So bright and still. O, had I but the eagle's pinion, Thither I'd soar, And there possess my sole dominion, Till life be o'er. [VI. They call me,—they call me, from meadow and grove] They call me,—they call me, from meadow and grove; They sing to me sweetly of hope and of love; And dove-like and peacefully, over My pillow they hover. And they say to me kindly: “O, hasten away! No longer in dreamy oblivion stay;— Young life with its bloom is before thee, And heaven is o'er thee. “O'er valley and mountain, in beauty and light, The world stretches onward, so dewy and bright; The roses are budding beside thee;— What joy shall betide thee! “The day has awakened, so fresh and so fair; The clouds float aloft in the warm summer air; All nature is swelling with gladness;— O, sink not in sadness.” I hear ye,—I hear ye,—I will not delay, But up, and o'er valley and mountain away;— Through life, like a bird, I will hie me;— Hope never shall fly me. [VII. “O, rest thee here in silent bower] “O, rest thee here in silent bower;— The noon-shut folds its yellow flower, The air shines quivering o'er the hill, And all around is hushed and still. “On mossy pillow lay thee here. A spring, so cool, is bubbling near;— O, lay thee down!—a draught I'll bring, So clear and sparkling, from that spring. “Ah! thou a long and weary way Hast travelled through the sultry day;— Close soft thy eyes, and I will keep Watch o'er thee in thy gentle sleep. “My heart is rich,—my hand is free, However poor and low I be: I have but little in my store;— I give thee all,—what could I more?” “Thy cup I drink, and now I close My weary eyes in sweet repose. Thy heart is rich,—thy hand is free! A princess, thou shalt go with me.” [VIII. The song is still, that over heath and mountain] The song is still, that over heath and mountain, When closed the day, Thro' glimmering wood, by sky-empurpled fountain, Stole soft away,— In shady vale, by stream through roses playing, On golden hill, Breathed faint and low, as tenderly delaying,— The song is still. The song is still, that clear in morning hovered O'er field and grove, When billowy mist the winding valley covered, Rocks glowed above,— When bleat and bark, from bushy lawn repeated, Rose round the hill,— The joyous song, that light and buoyant fleeted,— The song is still. O, wake the song!—its notes remembered waken My love of home: Spite of my firmer will, my heart is shaken By thoughts that come, Thoughts of my early days,—in frolic measure They glide along: The song of youth, to notes of love and pleasure,— O, wake the song! [IX. Night is on the hill] Night is on the hill,— Hushed the clattering mill: Deeper shadows fall,— Only mothers call, Careless as they roam, Laughing youngsters home. Now the evening star, Over mountain far, Mild in beauty beaming, On the fountain streaming, Turns the eye of love To the heaven above. Dark and darker spread Shadows o'er the bed Of the woodland lake; Fainter ripples break On the pebbled shore: Evening's breeze is o'er. Night is deep and still; Stars unnumbered fill Nature's temple o'er me; Glides a light before me, Steals in darkness far,— 'T is my spirit's star. [X. Bells are ringing] Bells are ringing; Maidens singing By the village tree: Wreaths and banners flying, Youth his vigor trying, Joy is wild and free. Harvest over, Friend and lover Hasten to the green: Love with crown of myrtle, Health in forest kirtle, Beauty rules as queen. Fleetly glancing, Lightly dancing, All is laugh and song; So till golden even Kindles earth and heaven, So they wheel along. Bright in gushes, Smiles and blushes Come and flit away. Harvest now is over, So shall friend and lover Greet the festive day. [XI. The snow is gone] The snow is gone; The waters run, Through valley rushing, From cavern gushing, And foam along In light and song. The sky is blue; The Spring is new; The buds are swelling; The stag is belling; The lark and dove Bring life and love. The woods are green; In emerald sheen The grass is springing; The vales are ringing With hound and horn: Young May is born! [XII. Give me that fond music] Give me that fond music, That charmed my heart so sweetly: Softly breathed its numbers, Deep to my inmost soul. The light-winged dance obeys it; The maidens trip it featly; All darker passion slumbers; Full tides of gladness roll. Still the sound is flowing, Like summer brook at even, Over pebbles leaping In sparkling joy along. The wind is faintly blowing; The clouds are bright in heaven; The spirits there are keeping A festival of song. Wake the sounding viol! Dark eyes, with speaking glances, Kindle high with pleasure, As rings the well-known strain. With easy gliding motion, Involved in graceful fancies Of light uncertain measure, Responds the mimic train. [XIII. Morning is lightest] Morning is lightest Only when heaven is fair. Beauty is brightest Only when virtue is there. Crystal of fountain, Foam from the heart of the sea, Snow of the mountain, Virtue! are emblems of thee. Beauty! we lend thee Blossom and gem of the mine: Stars, too, attend thee; Thine are the rose and the vine. Flowers by the fountain, Mirrored below in the spring; Gems on the mountain, Studding the snow as a ring;— Clearest and whitest Soften by veiling their glow: Fairest and brightest Only are loveliest so. [XIV. 'T is dawn] 'T is dawn: The rosy light is breaking; To song the birds are waking; And starry beads are shaking Along the grassy lawn. 'T is noon: Blue rise the hills before me; Pure swells the azure o'er me; And radiant blossoms pour me The balmy breath of June. 'T is even: Gay clouds, like curtains, lie Athwart the golden sky; The wind goes whispering by, Like soothing voice from heaven. 'T is night: The world how hushed and still! Dim towers the shadowy hill; Earth's guardian spirits fill Their urns with holy light. [XV. Joy! Joy!] Joy! Joy! The long dark night is past; The weary way is done; Bright o'er the mountain, fast Ascends the cheering sun. Joy! Joy! My heart revives again; My soul new lights its fires; I speed along the plain, With hope that never tires. See! See! The well-known hill is nigh; The spiry poplars rise; The brook is winding by; There still my cottage lies. Hark! Hark! What welcome sounds of home! I know their meaning well: Far, far my foot may roam, Yet deep and strong their spell. Hark! Hark! The longing heifer lows; Shrill barks my faithful Tray: His master's tread he knows, And see! he bounds away. Shout! Shout! The goal, the goal is nigh; My love is at the door: We run, we leap, we fly; We meet to part no more! [XVI. Faintly breathes the maiden's song] Faintly breathes the maiden's song Through the twilight grove; Softly sweet it steals along; — 'T is the song of love. Evening slumbers hushed and still; Mute the hum of day: Only winds the gurgling rill Under flowers away. Whispered voices echo far Through the shadowy vale; Glimmers by a twinkling star Dian's crescent pale. Fade in darkness bush and tree: Rock and wood grow dim: Wide o'er plain and silent sea Wavering phantoms swim. Still the maiden's murmured song Trembles through the grove; Steals, like spirit's breath, along;— 'T is the song of love. [XVII. In sheeted gold the river glides] In sheeted gold the river glides By rock with forest crowned; Deep-mirrored in its crystal tides, Bright swell the hills around. High over yonder mountain wall, That darkly girds the west, Broad flashes light heaven's airy hall, And stream on ocean's breast. Shot upward as a furnace flare, Day's funeral fires ascend; Then, fading through the hazy air, The softer colors blend: And as each fleecy cloud they stain, Filling the sky with bloom, The freshening breeze along the plain Wafts from the flowers perfume: And wakened by the gentle hour, From garden thicket flows Love-music, worthy of its bower, Its sheltering bower of rose. It steals along in softest tone, The siren melody: I sit and drink the song alone; My spirit then how free! [XVIII. Sitting by a meadow brook] Sitting by a meadow brook, In the month of June, Once a short repose I took, Just at sunny noon. Blossoms, many-tinted, shone O'er the meadow far; But one blossom stood alone, 'Mong them all a star. Once it seemed a full-blown rose; Golden lily then: Wreaths of snowdrops now unclose; Blooms the rose again. Who can tell the wondrous flower,— Flower that reigns alone? He who beauty's magic power O'er the heart has known. [XIX. How gentle the water's motion] How gentle the water's motion,— How silent the silver sea! The moonbeam sleeps on the ocean, How calmly and peacefully! My bark, on the mirror gliding, Seems borne by spirits along, Or in tremulous stillness riding, Deep fixed by the siren's song. Bright quivers the sea before me, Like gush of furnace in flow; The stars are glittering o'er me,— Bright glitter the stars below. What voice faint uttered is stealing In silence along the sea? It wakes my inmost feeling;— Thou fairest, it leads me to thee. [XX. The night is still:—on meadow and silvery fountain] The night is still:—on meadow and silvery fountain The moonbeam sleeps, like innocence cradled in love: With softened smile, it rests on the snow of the mountain, And tints the sky, like wing of ethereal dove. A cloud sails by, with lightest and easiest motion, Now bossed with pearl, now shining with purple and gold,— It glides away, like vessel afar on the ocean, And spirits of bliss seem borne on its silvery fold. A gentle wind, with fragrance of jessamine laden, Steals faintly on, as longing for calm and repose, And with it steals the lingering song of the maiden, Whose lonely heart is lightened by song of its woes. O, list the song!—if beauty and innocence ever Have touched thy soul, thy heart will respond to the strain. The voice of love, of sorrow and longing, will never, In soothing tones, be lost to thy spirit again. [XXI. Over hill and plain and mountain] Over hill and plain and mountain Speeds away, on pinions strong, Nerved with life from holy fountain, Far away, the soul of song. O'er it swells the arch of heaven, Boundless arch of softest blue; Round it rise the halls of even, Hung with every gorgeous hue. To the spirit-land of wonder, Cloud-concealed, it speeds afar, Borne on wings of rushing thunder, Sounding like the tempest car,— Rolling high, like ocean surges, When the midnight Typhon rings,— Hollow as a nation's dirges, When the Almighty vengeance stings,— Deep and full as torrent pouring From a wasted Alp of snows,— Awful as a Volcan roaring, Ere its fiery deluge flows;— Yet as stream in shady valley, Gurgling low through grass and flowers; Evening wind in garden alley, Brushing dew from lilac bowers; Mellow horn, as twilight closes, Winding through the slumbering grove; Maiden heart, by hedge of roses, Murmuring faint its lay of love;— Yet so soft their echo lingers Round the tranced listener's ear, Sweet as, struck by fairy fingers, Breathes the wind-harp, dim and clear. On by keenest longing driven, Speeds away their eagle flight, Till, the magic cloud-wall riven, Dazzling pours a sea of light. Then as beams the land of wonder, Bursting from its cloudy veil, Anthem tones, like peals of thunder, Bid the new inspirer hail. [XXII. From rock rebounding] From rock rebounding, Through wood resounding, In changeful echo is ringing The early horn, And Youth from his couch is springing, To greet the morn. The bright beams quiver On lake, and on river; The dew from the forest is falling, In starry light; And Spring on her train is calling, To wing their flight. Young Day! we hail thee! Gay clouds half veil thee, As over the dewy mountain Thou risest fair: Beneath thy smile, the fountain High sparkles there. Glad songs attend thee; New blossoms lend thee, By fairy touch unfolded, Their first perfume, And delicate hands have moulded Their varied bloom. Joy hovers by thee, And Health is nigh thee; A merry dance is bounding Before thy car; Their songs, aloft resounding, Are borne afar. I run to meet thee,— With song to greet thee: Thy handmaid, Beauty, around me Her loosened zone Has flung, and laughing has bound me, To be her own. SLAVONIA. PART I. [The following series of Sonnets is applicable to the four leading branches of the Slavonic race, namely: the first two, to the Russian; the third, to the Servian; the fourth, to the Polish; and the fifth, to the Bohemian.] [I. Near Moskva's stream, through heath and forest gliding] “Malenkoy krolik w trawkie zelenoy S miloy podruz'koy tam otdychaet; Golub na wietoczkie spit.”— Karamsin. “There, in the green grass, softly reposes, Close by his dear little loveling, the cony; There the dove sleeps on the bough.” Near Moskva's stream, through heath and forest gliding, Deep in a river-vale, by meadow green, Embowered in beech, a lonely church is seen, Like timid fawn in dewy thicket hiding. Above its roof, a Grecian crosslet, shining, Points to the pious serf his heavenward way; Around it spreads, bestrewn with blossoms gay, The field, where wearied hearts are safe reclining. O'er swelling graves, the bounding rabbit plays; All breathes of peace and gentleness around; Light steals the maiden by; subdued each sound; Even fainter glances there the evening blaze. There, nestling side by side, at twilight's close, Soft coo the billing doves, and then repose. [II. Inspiring Spirit! thou art everywhere] “Tam widiel gory nad soboiu, I sprasziwal, kotoroy wiek Zastal ich w molodosti suszczich.”— Dmitriev. “There I saw above me mountains, And I asked of them, what century Met them in their youth.” Inspiring Spirit! thou art everywhere. The forest and the desert; ocean's breast; The ice-peak, where the condor builds his nest; The plain; the hill; the vale;—thou still art there. 'T is not alone on Zion's holy height, Nor on Parnassus, thou hast reared thy shrine: Thy kindling voice and energy divine Are felt in realms of old Cimmerian night. By Volga's princely stream, thy fiery car Uplifts the gifted soul, that owns thy sway, Aloft, above the gilded dome of Tzar;— O'er boundless steppes and dusky wilds away, O'er castled hill, where reigns the proud Boyar, Free, amid slaves, he mounts to meet thy day. [III. What is that descending yonder mountain?] “Trepetin li nowi wenci na naszoj snaszi? Wije li se crwen barjak nad milim kumom? Jeli zdrawo ko? zelenko pod mladoz'e?om?”— Nar. Srp. Pjesm. “Tremble not new-woven garlands there on our sister? Waves not the crimson banner over the sponsor? Is not strong the dapple-gray under the bridegroom?” “What is that descending yonder mountain? Waves the Aga's crimson flag afar? Comes the Turkish wolf to wage us war? Or does shepherd lead his flock to fountain? “Yonder see the wedding-banner flying,— Garlands waving in the maiden's hair;— O, how tall and slender, fresh and fair!” So the long expectant train is crying. Give this happy day aloose to joy; Glad the heart with instrument and song; Flit, with maiden dear, in dance along; Let not care nor thought your bliss annoy! Under slavery's chain the bosom swells;— There, the fount of gentle feeling wells. [IV. Still Spring returns, and scatters wide its roses] “Piekny to widok Czertomeliku, Sto wysp przerz'nely Dniepru strumienie, Brzoza sie kapie w kaz'dym strumyku, Slychac szum trzciny, slowika pienie.” —Slowacki. “How beautiful this view of Czertomelik! The Dnieper's streams divide a hundred islands; In every stream the birch-tree dips its branches; We hear the murmuring reed, and night-bird warbling.” Still Spring returns, and scatters wide its roses; The nightingale in leafy thicket sings, And heavenward mounts the lark on quivering wings; In flowery pomp the silent plain reposes. Nature is still the same, unchanging ever; She brings her gifts with each returning year, And lavish pours her horn of plenty here, By castled hill and silver-sheeted river. Still lordly Dnieper rolls as wild and free, As when the Polish banner graced its shore;— That banner waves along its banks no more; Through isles as green it seeks the Pontic sea. Nature is ever free!—Why should the brave And noble heart of Poland sink,—a slave! [V. By Muldava trips a rose-lipped maiden] “Gdi, ma mila, gdi do lesa; Podjwey se geli rosa: Rosyczka ge piekna bjla, Roste na nj rosmaryna, Bude gj z'jt moge mila.”— Czesk. Nar. Pjsn. “Go, my dearest, to the wood; See if still the dew is there: Lovely is the early dew; In it grows the rosemary; Thou shalt on it live, my love.” By Muldava trips a rose-lipped maiden,— She has crowned her hat with summer flowers; Fresh and dewy as the fabled Hours, There she trips along, with blossoms laden. How the valley with her voice is ringing, Like the evening songster's, soft and clear! In her happy eye a sparkling tear: She a simple Cheskian lay is singing. O, how strong the love of country glows In the peasant's heart, when all is gone, King and state, his language left alone, Blooming still, as over graves the rose. From his bosom pours the stream of song, Full, in artless melody, along. PART II. RUSSIA. [I. Still burns the prophet's fire, as when of old] “Niczto!—no Ty wo mnie sijaesz Weliczestwom Twoich debrot; Wo mnie sebia izobraz'aesz, Kak solnce w maloy kaplie wod.”— Derzhavin. “Nothing!—but thou shinest in me with the majesty of thy goodness; in me thou imagest thyself, like the sun in a little drop of water.” Still burns the prophet's fire, as when of old Elijah called, on Carmel, on the name, The one sole name; and see! it mounts in flame, Just on the limits of eternal cold. Pure, bright, and full, it swells;—a sacred glow Rolls o'er the spotless wilderness of snow, And floating flakes of crystal burn as gems, Worthy to shine in angels' diadems: And then, in sounding tones, come thoughts of power, Full of sublimity and truth and awe: Thunders in majesty the unyielding law; Relenting grace descends in healing shower. We feel as nothing in the infinite: We feel that infinite within our souls,— Away the cloud of doubt and darkness rolls; Our spirits stand, assured and free, in light. [II. Not the trumpet calls to fight] “Och wy Ruskïe dobrye molodcy! Nadiewayte wy sabli wostryia, Czto idet zlodiey na swiatuju Rus.”— Shulepnikov. “Hey, brave Russian youths! Gird your swords so keen, For your holy land the foe invades.” Not the trumpet calls to fight,— Louder calls the patriot Tzar. Strongly armed with sword and right, We rush to war. Treads the Frank our holy land, By the world-invader led,— Soon we make the ruffian band Its gory bed. Moscow's fire, an altar-flame, Lights us through a waste of snow; On, through ice, we chase the game With fervid glow. Louder than the trumpet's peal, Rings the voice of patriot Tzar;— With fiery hearts and flashing steel, We rush to war. SERVIA. [I. Go forth, and ask no blessing on thy sword] “Zemalsko je za maleno carstwo, A nebesko u wek i do weka.”— N. S P. (Tzar Lazar.) “Small and transient is an earthly kingdom, But the heavenly is now and ever.” “Go forth, and ask no blessing on thy sword,— Go forth, and rush upon the turbaned foe: Strong be the hand that deals the deadly blow; That hand shall scatter wide the Turkish horde.” “Thine shall be earthly power and fame; but know, The gates of Heaven shall ever on thee close;— In vain for thee the stream of mercy flows, For thou hast chosen thy good, thy all, below. “Pause on the field, and bend thyself in prayer; Yield reverently unto thy God and Lord; Listen the hopes and terrors of his word. Then thou shalt fall,—thy better lot is there,— Thy crown shall be in Heaven.” He knelt and prayed; He marched and fought, and low in death was laid. [II. For faith and fame! be that the cry] “Srbli wiczu: za wjeru risztiansku, I za slawu imena Srpskoga!”— N. S. P. “Cry the Servians: For the faith of Christians, And the glory of the name of Servia!” For faith and fame! be that the cry. We have our pride, and we our fame;— Heroes, of high and mighty name, On thousand fields of battle lie. Long centuries we in arms have stood; Have kept our faith, when others fell: The Turk might crush, he could not quell;— Our covenant we have sealed in blood. Our land is free,—the cross alone Shines o'er our vales, and crowns our hills: The peasant reaps the soil he tills; The Moslem vultures far have flown. Again they come!—like clouds of night, They hang along yon mountain's brow. Rise, Servians! be heroes now;— This be the last and fatal fight. Hark to the charge! their Allahu, It rings, not ours,—it rings their knell. Rush to the shock, and, bursting through, Leave not a Turk the tale to tell. POLAND. [I. Thou standest as a castle on a rock] “Dzis sepy czarnem skrzydlem oblatuja groby, Jak w miescie, ktore calkiem wybije zaraza, Wiecznie z baszt powiewaja choragwie z'aloby.” Mickiewicz. “Now, black-winged vultures hover over graves, As in a town, by wasting plague consumed, Wave ever funeral-banners on the walls.” Thou standest as a castle on a rock, Dismantled, dark;—the hospitable flame No longer lights its halls; unknown to fame, The simple shepherd shelters there his flock. With trumpet-peal its gilded arches rung; Forth from its gates the lordly champions rode; Bannered and helmed, the dazzling torrent flowed; On tower and keep the royal standard hung. A fire has swept along those festive halls; Broken and toppling, reel the blackened walls; The voice of love and hope and joy is gone. Like funeral-flags, the raven spreads his wings; In chambers once the proud abode of kings, Now dwell the lizard and the owl alone. [II. Vengeance calls you! quick, be ready] “Zemsta pospiech radzi. Juz' pojechali—Niech ich Bog prowadzi.”— Slowacki. “Vengeance bids haste. Already they are gone—may God conduct them.” Vengeance calls you! quick, be ready! Rouse ye, in the name of God. Onward, onward! strong and steady;— Dash to earth the oppressor's rod. Vengeance calls! ye brave, ye brave! Rise, and spurn the name of slave. Grasp the sword! its edge is keen: Seize the gun! its ball is true: Sweep your land from tyrants clean,— Haste, and scour it through and through. Onward, onward!—vengeance cries. Rush to arms,—the tyrant flies. By the souls of patriots gone, Wake! arise! your fetters break! See, Kosciuszko bids you on! Hark, Sobieski cries, Awake! Rise, and front the despot Czar,— Rise, and dare the unequal war. Vengeance calls you! quick, be ready! Think of what your sires have been. Onward, onward! strong and steady;— Drive the tyrant to his den. On, and let the watchword be, Country, home, and liberty! BOHEMIA. [I. The rose now blooms,—with love my bosom heaves] “Wyrostla mnie bjla ruoz'e, ga gi trhat nebudu; Milowala gsem Wencliczka, wjc milowat nebudu.” Czesk. Nar. Pjsn. “Full for me the rose has opened, but I will not pluck the rose; I have given my heart to Wensly, but I'll love the youth no more.” The rose now blooms,—with love my bosom heaves; It fades and withers,—sorrow chills my heart: The cold rains trickle o'er the faded leaves,— Tears from their secret fount unbidden start. The dewy morning rises fresh and fair,— Hope comes again, to wake my love anew: With blooms of May the maiden wreathes her hair,— Joy swells my heart, as swells the rose with dew. Thus flows the Cheskian song; the song thus flows In Servia's vales, on Russia's boundless plains, By Visla's banks, unfettered or in chains, Where'er the pure Slavonian spirit glows. Ages have rolled away, yet still remain The seeds, that time and force have crushed in vain. [II. A holy feeling leads them on] “Kdoz' gste Boz'j bogownjky A zakona geho.”— Zizka. “Ye warriors of God, and of his law.” A holy feeling leads them on; For God their swords they draw: Their chief, the fearless champion Of God, and of his law. Not theirs, the strength of mortal fight; Religion nerves their hands: They lift their arms for truth and right; For faith, each warrior stands. The ardent hymn, the solemn prayer, Instead of trump and drum, Tell to their enemies: “Beware!— The sacred legions come.” With brow serene and steady eye, Firm foot and measured tread,— “Huss!” burst at once the battle-cry,— “His blood for truth was shed.” And loud, as pealing thunder, breaks From thousand hearts their hymn: Headlong they rush,—earth 'neath them shakes,— Smoke rolls,—the day is dim. “Huss!” swells the cry, and Zizka's shout Rings through the roar of war. The foe recoils,—he breaks in rout And scatters wide and far. “Glory to God!” the victory song;— “Praise him,—the field is won. He only makes the warrior strong. His will—his will be done!” TEUTONIA. [Under this head is grouped a number of pieces, which, by the structure of their verse, if not by their style and manner, are, in character, German. The stanza, in each, is formed on the model indicated by the motto prefixed. In the third and fifth, the rhythm of the air is observed, rather than that of the original verse.] HOPE. “Hoffnung, Hoffnung, immer grün.”— Herder. “Hope, Hope, for ever green.” Dark before me lies my way: Not a blossom by it springs; Not a bird, on sunny wings, Hovers round, and tunes his lay. On it stretches, wild and lone: Chill the wind is whistling there; Gone the light that early shone; Vanished long, the young and fair. As with heaving heart I tread Silent onward, heaven uncloses; Hope descends on clouds of roses; Instant all my gloom has fled. Like an overswelling river, Round her flows a stream of light: Radiant pinions o'er it quiver; Countless joys are there in flight. But a moment—dark again, Dark and dreary, shuts the sky: Heavy clouds above me lie; Round me clings an icy chain. O, could but a single ray Gleam from cottage lamp or star, Then, along my lingering way, I could seek my home afar. Hark! what low and distant note Softly through the gloom is stealing? With it comes a voice of healing; Sounds of heaven around me float. Light, like vernal dawn, ascending, O'er new-wakened beauty plays; Flowers, with feathered foliage blending, Tremble in the golden blaze. Soon the soothing voice is still; Broods the silence of the grave: O'er me shades of cypress wave; Darker fears my bosom fill. Thus must ever be my doom:— Light and song a moment shed; Then a cloud of deeper gloom Rolled, like torrent, o'er my head. “Speed thee on!”—in sweetest tone, Hope, the young and lovely ever, Breathes,—the song shall leave me never,— “Speed thee!—soon thy night has flown. All the light, the love, the bliss, E'er in holiest vision given, In a fairer world than this, Greet thee soon;—thy home is Heaven!” SKATING. “Wir gleiten, o Brüder, mit fröhlichem Sinn Auf Sternengefilden das Leben dahin.”— Herder. “We glide, O brothers! in cheerful play, O'er starry fields, through life away.” We speed o'er the star-lighted mirror along, And the wood and the mountain re-echo our song. As on, like the wing of the eagle, we sweep, Now gliding, now wheeling, we ring o'er the deep. The winds whistle keenly,—the red cheek is warm, And there's none who would yield not his breast to the storm. The stars are above us, so full and so bright, And the mirror below us is gemmed with their light. Like the far-wheeling hawk, in the mid-air we fly; A sky is above us,—below us a sky. As onward we glide in our race, we keep time; And clear as the morning bell echoes our chime. By pine-covered rock, and by willow-bound shore, Breast even with breast, like a torrent we pour. Short, quick are our strokes, as we haste to the mark, And shrill is our cry, as the trill of the lark. The goal is now reached, and we bend us away, Wide wheeling, or curving in fanciful play. How fondly I loved, when my life-blood was young,— When buoyant my heart, and my limbs newly strung,— When the friends of my childhood were round me and near,— O'er the dark lake to sweep in our sounding career; And high beat my soul, with enthusiast glow, As a clear-ringing music was pealing below. We heeded no danger,—we carelessly flew O'er a deep, that in darkness was lost to our view; And onward we rushed, in the heat of our strife, As, o'er danger and ruin, we hurry through life. So we sped in our flight, as on pinions along, And the wood and the mountain re-echoed our song. THE CHARGE. “Wohlauf Kameraden, aufs Pferd, aufs Pferd! Ins Feld, in die Freyheit gezogen.”— Schiller. “Arouse ye, my comrades,—to horse, to horse! To the field, and to freedom, advancing.” The horn and the trumpet are ringing afar, As the summons to battle is sounding; And the steed, as he catches the signal of war, In the pride of his spirit is bounding. Shrill it echoes afar, over hill and o'er plain, And the wide distant mountains repeat it again; And the shout of the warrior, and nearer the song, Peal aloud, as the glittering bands are hurrying along. As on, on, on, on, pours the tide of fight, Still aloft floats the tossing flag, in the glance of morning's light. We leap to our saddles, we range us in line, As the voice of the trumpet is calling. O'er the crown of yon ridge, bright their drawn sabres shine; Down its slope, like a flood, they are falling. “Give the spur,—to the charge,—ere the foeman is nigh: Rush amain, as the forest rings loud with your cry: Speed on to the shock, in his midway career,— For our sires still were first in fight; they never thought of fear!” So on, on, on, on, o'er the sounding plain, To the wild conflict fierce they rush, and together dash amain. THE WILD HUNTER. “Es kam die Nacht gezogen.”— Schreiber. What gloomy shapes are bending, In darkness, o'er the plain? The distant hills ascending, Behold! they sweep amain. The rock and the forest re-echo the sound Of horn and of trumpet, of horse and of hound;— Hurra! with horn and hound, The rocks and woods resound. He hurries on affrighted, The wanderer, through the gloom Alone by flashes lighted, He hurries to his doom! Then it rolls from afar, like the echoing peal Of the storm, and the mountain-tops quiver and reel,— The quivering mountains reel, As bursts the echoing peal! “And whither art thou flying, Thou wanderer, on thy way? The heavy wind is sighing, And see, the lightnings play.” “But hark, from the heart of the deep-rolling cloud, The horn of the huntsman is ringing aloud,— From the deep-rolling cloud, The horn rings long and loud.” “And why so wildly straying? Seest not, on yonder height, Around the white walls playing, The mellow evening light?” “In terror I haste from that castle away; There wildly the hounds of the dark hunter bay,— The hounds there wildly bay; In fear I haste away!” “Unreal dreams affright thee; Wild visions haunt thy soul. Wouldst thou 'mid rocks benight thee, When near the thunders roll?” “The steeds are in chase, and the bay of the hound, Keen scenting my track, is now pealing around,— The hollow bay of hound Peals awfully around!” In wild despair retreating Before the gathering host, Through rock and forest fleeting, He mutters, Lost! lost! lost! Then the storm bursts above him with echoing peal! And around him the troops of the wild hunter wheel,— As bursts the echoing peal, Around they dash and wheel! And swift the host advancing, Beneath their thundering tread, The rocks and trees are dancing; Their blades flash keenly red. The woods bow before them; the cliffs crack, and pour Their avalanche prone, 'mid the rush and the roar,— The cliffs loud crackling pour, Amid the rush and roar! How sweetly dawns the morning! The fearful night is gone. Yon chapel bell its warning Rings faintly all alone. On the breeze, as it curls over meadow and lake, Breathes the voice of the bird from her nest in the brake, And, floating far away, Welcomes the peaceful day! THE HUNTER DEATH. “Ich hab' eine Wiege so schmuck und nett.”— Schmidt. I am a bold hunter,—my hunt is wide; I mount in the morning, and swift I ride; O'er vale, o'er hill, I speed away, And pause not, rest not, through the long, long day. My string is of sinew, my bow is long, And sharp is my arrow, my arm is strong: I point my shaft with deadly aim; It whizzes, pierces,—then it burns like flame. And I have a carabine slung on my back,— It rings through the forest with startling crack; Like thunder-crash it echoes round, And, jarring, quivering, 'neath it shakes the ground. And sure is the foot of my coal-black steed; Ever onward he rushes with lightning speed: He snuffs in every wind the prey, Then, high exulting, wildly bursts away. And keen is the scent of my well-trained pack; Through wood and through thicket they keep the track; The game his subtlest art may try,— It aids not, boots not, quick the hounds are by. I sound on my clanging horn his knell, And fiercely they answer with howl and yell: They plunge through swamp, they dash through flood, Yet wilder rages, hot, their thirst for blood. One hound is jet-black, and I call him War; And his strong limbs are spotted with wound and scar; His eye is red, like coal its fire, And ever sleepless burns his demon ire. Another close follows with hoarser din, Coarse-featured and shaggy,—I call him Sin: Bloodshot his eye,—his froth is blue, And drips its venom thick, like poison dew. Another is sallow, and gaunt of limb; His lips are pale, and his eye is dim: I call him Famine,—but he is strong, And swift, yet silent, sweeps, like night, along. So with twanging bow, and with clanging horn, To dusk of night, from break of morn, On coal-black steed, I speed away, And pause not, rest not, through the long, long day. THE BARD. “Was hör' ich draussen vor dem Thor.”— Goethe. The bard sits lonely in the hall, His cherished harp beside him. From friend so dear, whate'er befall, No moment can divide him. Erect and calm, he sits alone,— The only friend he feels his own, His cherished harp beside him. A pageant throng now fills the hall:— There beauty darts her glances, And mingled voices joyous call For song and wine and dances. He sits apart from all the train,— The song and dance invite in vain; Unfelt are beauty's glances. The present has no charms for him; The distant only wakes him. Where hoary eld lies dark and dim, A living spirit takes him. Unbidden to life's banquet, he Wide wanders, all alone, yet free, As ancient glory wakes him. The song is swelling in the hall, Loud music clangs around him, When quick, as touched by lightning, fall The chains that silent bound him. He throws his hand athwart his strings; A clear, sweet tone, preluding, rings; His Genius hovers round him. The song is hushed; the clang is still; Spell-bound, they pause to hear him: He bends and sways their hearts at will; Entranced they gather near him: Full-toned, yet soft, his measures roll; They fill with deep delight the soul: They cannot choose but hear him. The bard has gone,—his song is o'er, Yet still he sits before them. He wakes his magic harp no more; Its tones still hover o'er them. Away he wanders, sad and lone,— Still sits he there, as on a throne, Erect and calm, before them. SONGS I. THE BOATMAN. Our oars keep time In merry chime, As light we pull to the shore. By greenwood tree My home I see,— So heave! for our voyage is o'er. The golden day Now fades away, And red uprises the moon The water-flake, Along our wake, Is lost in darkness soon. And west, afar, The evening star Looks over the curling lake; And hark! my ear— The shore is near— Can hear the ripples break. The window-light Now greets my sight,— My wife is waiting there. Along the strand I see them stand, My boys, so gentle and fair. So pull away;— I hear them say, “See! yonder, father has come. The window is bright,— A happy night There'll be in the boatman's home. II. WINTER EVENING. The fire is burning cheerly bright, The room is snug and warm; We keep afar the wintry night, And drive away the storm; And when without the wanderer pines, And all is dark and chill, We sit securely by the fire, And sparkling glasses fill. And ever as the hollow wind Howls through the moaning trees, Strange feelings on the boding heart With sudden chillness seize: But brightly blazes then the hearth, And freely flows the wine; And laugh of glee, and song of mirth, Then wreathe their merry twine. We think not how the dashing sleet Beats on the crusted pane; We care not though the drifting snow Whirls o'er the heath amain: But haply, while our hearts are bright, Far struggling through the waste, Some traveller seeks our window's light, With long and fruitless haste. Hark his halloo!—we leave the fire, And hurry forth to save: A short half-hour, and he had found, Beneath the snow, a grave. Pile on the wood,—feed high the flame,— Bring forth our choicest store! The traveller's heart grows warm again; His spirit droops no more. III. EVENING. The evening star is sparkling bright, And in darkness fades the rosy light: How sweetly shines that evening star, Bright-twinkling o'er the hills afar! The last expiring gleam of day, The mellow twilight, steals away; But soon, with full and silver light, The moon walks forth and cheers the night. What softer feelings through my soul, What tender, sweet emotions roll! Though the light of day is gone, is gone, My love still burns as brightly on: And beneath the moon I rove along, And low I hum my own dear song; Away 't is floating on the air,— O, will it reach my fair, my fair? [IV. O the days of blooming youth are gone] O the days of blooming youth are gone! How swift the years are hasting on! My eye has lost its lustre bright; My flowing locks are thin and white. The blissful moments would not stay; Like dreams, they glided quick away: But still in memory they remain; Those happy hours are young again. And oh! may they be ever there, As dear to me, as sweet and fair; And even till life's last sand is run, O may they flow as brightly on! My eye grows dim; my pulse beats still; Life's winter waxes dark and chill: But still youth's dreams are fresh and bright; Still burns as pure love's holy light. [V. O, how softly sweet the song is flowing] O, how softly sweet the song is flowing, Softly flowing through the mellow air, Kind refreshment on my heart bestowing, Waking thoughts that long had slumbered there! Then fond memory sweetly loves to bring me Scenes that still forgotten long had lain; Youth's emotions, bright and joyous, wing me Lightly to the heaven of love again. And its earliest blossoms have not faded;— Still they fill around the sunny air; And with bower of heavenly rose is shaded Still the spring of joy that bubbles there. O, when softly sweet the song is flowing, Ever glides from me my spirit's chain! Then I mount, with youth's first passion glowing, Lightly to the heaven of love again. [VI. The night is dark; the hollow wind] The night is dark; the hollow wind Is breathing faint and low: Though loth to leave my love behind, Perforce away I go. Away o'er mountain and o'er moor,— My guide, no friendly star; No window-light, to lead me o'er The heath, that spreads afar. Though dark the night, a darker shade Hangs heavy round my heart. How deep it sank, as cold she said Those bitter words: “We part!” “We part, and, ay, for ever too: My love for thee has gone.” I turned, and bade no last adieu But wildly hurried on. O, on, through sleet and driving rain, Still let me ever haste! Day breaks not on my heart again, Life lies for ever waste. Away o'er mountain and o'er moor, Though cold the gusty wind: No light to cheer me on before,— Hope, love, all left behind! [VII. O come, loved Spirit, come to me] O come, loved Spirit, come to me! My heart, my heart, invoketh thee. Though dark and cheerless broods my night, Thy presence fills it all with light. O come, loved Spirit, gently come! O make beside my heart thy home! Look on me with endearing smile,— That look shall all my woes beguile. O be thou ever, ever nigh! Bend on me thy complacent eye: Then shall my heart swell up to thee, My soul be large, my spirit free. Bear me away, through sun and star, To worlds of softest light afar: Then bid my wearied eyelids close, On pillowed flowers, in blest repose. [VIII. Wife! I am dying] Wife! I am dying,— Life is departing; Soon I must leave thee, Soon I am gone. O, wilt thou weep me When I have left thee? O, wilt thou weep me When I am gone? If I have ever Wronged thee or grieved thee, O now forgive me, Ere I am gone! Sadly I rue it,— Thou wilt forget it; O then forgive me, Ere I am gone! Darkness is round me,— Dimly I see thee; Life is just closing,— Soon I am gone. O, thou wilt weep me, Truly wilt weep me,— Yes, thou wilt weep me, When I am gone! IX. EVENING. The evening star now sparkles bright; Full shines the rising moon; And fleetly fades the rosy light Around the horizon. The bosom swells with holy joy; The heart beats soft and low: No longer care and pain annoy; Unchecked the feelings flow. The meadow brook now dances light, Its wave shines silver-clear: The stars are dancing strangely bright, Along yon azure sphere. The nightingale her melody Trills lightly from the brake; And trembling floats, in harmony, The moonbeam on the lake. The lovelorn maiden listens long, As trills the melody: Her tender bosom feels it strong; Her tears are flowing free. She fondly thinks her lover then Is serenading nigh; And sadly sweet in dreams again She sees him standing by. O, evening is the time for me! Be thine the gairish day: My spirit is so full and free, As fades the light away! My bosom swells with holy joy; My heart beats soft and low; And fondly then, without annoy, My gentler feelings flow. X. AWAKE, MY LYRE. Awake, my lyre, awake! Breathe aloud the choral strain; From thy heavy slumber break; Wake to life and joy again. Hark! how on thy trembling strings Songs of hope and love rebound! Brushed as by an angel's wings, How the vocal chords resound! Now thy long, deep sleep has flown; Spirit burns along thy wire: How the swelling peals roll on, Full, instinct with living fire. O, be silent nevermore! Soar to day's eternal blue; Through the solemn midnight pour Notes that fall like starry dew. As on eagle's pinions, take High to heaven thy sweep again; Light and music o'er us shake, Like a shower of golden rain. Awake, my lyre, awake! Breathe aloud the choral strain. XI. HUNTING SONG. O, see how the red-deer boundeth, As he hears the horn in the morning! He leaps, as the blast resoundeth, In his flight the hunter scorning. And away, away, O, away, He fleets through the forest drear: 'T is more wild freedom's play, Than the hurried speed of fear. He leaps, as the blast resoundeth, In his flight the hunter scorning; And away, away he boundeth, As he hears the horn in the morning. Then oho! oho! oho! Away to chase the deer! Oho! oho! oho! The free, the free are here. And on, through the forest fleeting, He hies to the rock-built fountain, And hears but the echo retreating To the dells and glens of the mountain. He stands by the welcome spring, And looks in the mirror below,— When hark! through the green-wood ring The horn and the loud oho! He leaps, as the blast resoundeth, In his flight the hunter scorning; And away, away he boundeth, As he hears the horn in the morning. Then oho! oho! oho! Away to chase the deer! Oho! oho! oho! The free, the free are here. XII. MEMORY. O, when Memory brings her light, And sweetly calls me home, Swifter than the swallow's flight, Bright visions to me come. Such fond Memory brings On her golden wings,— O, she brings them with her light, And sweetly calls me home. Visions, veiled in roseate light, Then gently round me throng; Softest tones of young delight, Sweet tones, forgotten long, Melt into my soul, While with blest control, Hopes and fancies, starry bright, Mingle in the song. Memory, be thou ever near, To glad me on my way: Thy light to greet, thy voice to hear, O, I would fondly stay. Days that knew no shade, Ah! they never fade,— Beams from Heaven's eternal year Still lightly o'er them play. XIII. THE GERMAN EMIGRANT'S SONG. O Deutschland, our good Fatherland! Where grows the vine, along the Rhine; Where far the Alpine summits stand, And o'er the free-born Switzer shine; Where bright thy southern summer glows, Thy northern winter sleeps in snows: Thy pine-clad hills, thy heaths of sand, All linked by Union's golden band, Thou art our fathers' Fatherland. O Deutschland, blue-eyed Herman's home! Thou, earliest free, thy liberty Hast sent where'er the Saxon roam; Earth's new-born freedom sprang from thee. First o'er thy woods it dawned, nor yet Has there its pure effulgence set: On to the west still rolls the day, O'er ocean holds its heavenward way; Its Fatherland, still thou for aye. My Country! Home, where first I heard, Full, deep, and strong, the patriot song,— First learned to lisp the sacred word, As pealed the bells thy vales along,— Still with thee faith and honor dwell; The oath we swear, we keep it well: Nor needs our faith so strong a token; A grasp of hand, a pledge just spoken, Sure as our hearts, is never broken. O Deutschland, our own Fatherland! Though distant far, thou, like a star, Beamest on us from the Frisian strand; Our hearts, our loves, still centre there: Still we behold the purpling vine, Full clustered, crown the noble Rhine. O, may thy sons, by valor manned, With earnest soul, and strenuous hand, Strike for thee, sacred Fatherland! XIV. THE HARPER. The harper once in Tara's halls Rung loud the martial strain; Nor were those full and stirring notes Struck by his hand in vain. They roused the sons of Erin, far To drive the invading foe; They fired the heart, they nerved the hand, To deal the avenging blow. In vest of green, the harper sat Beside the royal throne; The golden chain, that slung his harp, In pride around him thrown. Wide through the halls his music rang, And warriors leaped to hear; Drew the bright sword, and shook it high, And tossed the beamy spear. But Tara's halls are seen no more; In ruin low they lie: The green turf o'er them weaves its sod, The weeds there mantle high; And Erin's sons no longer leap To hear their harp's wild tone: The light, that o'er their country shed Its beams from Heaven, has flown. And sadly now the harper wends To other realms his way: He seeks a freer, happier land, Where Britons bear no sway. Then welcome here, with generous cheer, The minstrel wandering lone; And let us ever hold him dear, And prize him as our own. [XV. That strain o' music greets my ear] That strain o' music greets my ear, Like joys o' days departed, When ilka mornin' dawn'd sae fair, An' fand me lightsome-hearted: It tells o' loves that ance I knew, O' een that shone sae clearly, An' ah! it minds me o' the voice O' her I loe'd sae dearly. It minds me o' the welcome, when I met her aft at gloamin; It minds me o' the sweet fareweel, When we had lang been roamin'. It is her sang,—I ken it true; Nae ither voice could breathe it; Nane wi' sic artless melody, Sae woodland wild, enwreath it. Flow gently on, thou sweetest strain; My heart is fain to hear thee; My loves I'll never know again; They dwell in heav'n a' near thee. An' yet the hopes o' ither days Dawn, as thou breathest round me; My spirit bursts to light an' life, Frae sorrow's chain that bound me. Thou stealest to my inmost soul, An' charm'st awa my sadness; The clouds, that heavy round me roll, Now break, an' a' is gladness. O fly na' yet! wi' lang delay, Still fondly linger near me; Blest voice o' joy an' comfort, stay! I'll never tire to hear thee. [XVI. An' hae ye heard the bonnie birds] An' hae ye heard the bonnie birds, That sing sae sweet i' the birken shaw? O ye may tell o' your nightingales,— Thae bonnie birds outsing them a'. An' ye may tell o' the minstrels too, Wha tune their harps in bower an' ha',— I better loe the bonnie birds, That sing sae sweet i' the birken shaw. Nae cushat ever safter croods, Amang the woods, her dyin' fa', Nae lav'rock louder lilts at morn, When mountin' high to heaven's ha'. Nae gloamin win' aye sighs sae low 'Mang autumn leaves in birken shaw; Nae pibroch 'mang the mountains rings Wi' fu'er swell its gatherin' ca'. An' wha can be the bonnie birds, That sing sae sweet i' the birken shaw? Twa bonnie lasses be thae birds, An' they might sing in palace ha'; Ae bonnie lassie sings sae sweet, Ye feel the tears unbidden fa'; But tither starts ye to your feet, An' stirs ye high, she sings sae braw. XVII. THE SPIRITS' LULLABY. When the night is still, On the moon-lit hill We sink in soft repose; While the cool winds sigh, And the rivulet nigh In mellow music flows. Then, as in dreams we float in light along, Sweet round us breathes from Heaven a cradle song: Slumber! slumber! Angels watch you nigh. Slumber! slumber! Spirits, gathering by, Sing their lullaby. Hushed to slumber deep, Softly then we sleep, And happy is our dream: Forms of beauty rare Float along the air; Their eyes how kindly beam. Then, as we listen, harps around us play; Gentlest of voices bid us come away: Hither, hither, where the heavens are bright,— Hither, hither, to this world of light,— Hither take your flight. [XVIII. Softly flow, thou gentle river] Softly flow, thou gentle river, Through the vale where dwells my love: Tell her, I am constant ever; Naught from her my heart can move. Bear this rose-leaf on thy bosom, Image of my constancy: Waft it safely to her cottage; Tell her it was sent by me. She will fondly stoop to gather From thy wave the welcome leaf, Press it to her lips, and smother Lightly so her swelling grief. Murmur faintly, as she takes it: “Faithful lover sent it thee; Be the treasure to thee ever Image of his constancy.” [XIX. Once I saw, in pride of beauty] Once I saw, in pride of beauty, Full unveiled, a golden flower; Sweetest perfume flowed around it: It was evening's winning hour. I approached the splendid blossom, Kissed its bosom, softly swelling; But no odors breathed around it, Though it seemed their chosen dwelling. By this blossom bloomed unseen, Low in shade, a milder flower; Pale its cheek and wet its eye, Bathed in evening's dewy shower. O'er the lonely flower I hung,— Thence the sweets that filled the air: To that gentle flower I clung,— Pale, yet seemed it more than fair. [XX. Once, in the heart of a desert] Once, in the heart of a desert, Blossomed a rose-bush unseen: Only the sands were around it; Naught but its leaf was there green. Ever, at evening and morning, Trickled its flowers with dew; And then, in light circles, round it Fondly a nightingale flew. Over the sands strayed a pilgrim, Lost in the midst of the wild, When on his faint eye, at evening, Sweetly the rose-blossom smiled: Sweetly the nightingale wooed him, Under its shade to repose; There his song charmed him to slumber, Wet by the dew of the rose. Freshly he rose in the morning, Dug in the sand by the flower, And a bright fountain up-sparkled, Welling with bubbling shower: Over the sands as it murmured, Green sprung the grass by its side; Round it a garden soon blossomed, Fed by its life-giving tide. There, too, a wild vine up-started; Under its shelter he dwelt: Morning and evening, yet ever Low by the rose-bush he knelt. So in the far waste, forgotten, Still flowed his pure life along, Soothed by the rose-blossom's fragrance, Charmed by the nightingale's song. [XXI. When the violet blows] When the violet blows, Light the swallow plumes his wings, Sweet the earliest robin sings; Something dearer brings the rose. Fairer forms are nigh, When the rose is full and bright: Ever shapes of softest light Then in glancing flight go by. From what clime are they? From the wakened heart they rise, Bright as hues of orient skies:— Soon the vision flies away. THE SISTER SPIRITS. A CANTATA. FIRST VOICE. I in the morning flutter Over the dew-lit flowers, Light in the morning flutter Around the rosy bowers. Gay as the mavis singing Among the dew-lit flowers, You hear my clear voice ringing Out of the rosy bowers, Out of the rosy bowers, Around the rosy bowers,— You hear my clear voice ringing Around the rosy bowers. SECOND VOICE. I, when the night is still, Over the ocean glide, Or round the silent hill, Upon the moonbeam ride. When all is dark and lone, From deep and winding dell You hear my magic tone, Like the distant mermaid's shell. From winding dell You hear it swell, Far, then near, like the mermaid's shell. BOTH. We are two sister peris, Floating in light along, Dancing at night with the fairies, Joining the lark in his song. We come and go, Like the sea in its flow, And soft as the snow, As it falls on the river, Steal to the heart, And are gone for ever. Sister spirits are we, From the heaven of song descending; Our feelings and tones agree, In harmony ever blending. FIRST VOICE. When o'er the hills the dawn is stealing, Hark to my trill of joyous feeling. SECOND VOICE. When the evening has faded and gone, List to my song as it dies away. FIRST VOICE. Hear me, too, when the dews are falling, Home to her bower the truant calling. SECOND VOICE. When the bright moon is rolling on, Hear my deep shell on the silvered bay, Hear my deep shell on the silvered bay. FIRST VOICE. Hark to my trill of joyous feeling, Like the young lark's, in his gladness wheeling. SECOND VOICE. List to my song as it dies away. List to my song as it bursts again, Loud as the trump on the battle-plain: Now, like the mountain horn, Clanging through wood and dell, Far on the echoes borne,— O, hark to its rolling swell! Careering, careering afar, It pours like a flood from the height, Answers from crag and scar, Then breathes like the whisper of night. FIRST VOICE. Merrily, merrily ringing, My clear voice wakens the grove, Clear as the woodman's, singing The song of his happy love. Like bees on the purple heather, When summer is still and bright, My tones, light hovering, gather New sweets in their airy flight. SECOND VOICE. Mine is the spell of power. FIRST VOICE. Mine is the charm of feeling. SECOND VOICE. Night is my chosen hour. FIRST VOICE. Mine is the cheerful day. BOTH. Each to the heart appealing, We rule with a magic sway, And willing spirits obey The sweet influence over them stealing. Winningly thus our tones combine, Like the lily and rose in perfect twine. A moment we hover, then take our flight: Good night to you all! Good night! Good night! CLASSIC MELODIES. PART I. [I have attempted, below, a series of imitations of four of the leading classes of ancient measures; namely, the Dactylic (Elegiac), Iambic (including the Anacreontic), Anapestic, and Trochaic. The first I have adapted, after the manner of Tyrtæus, to the Patriotic Elegy; the Iambic proper (Trimeter), to a subject not unsuited to its tragic character; the Anacreontic, to its not inappropriate purpose, as a Dithyrambic. The Anapestic has the proper movement of a march; in the longer lines (Tetrameter), that of a dead march; in the shorter (Dimeter), that of an onset. The Trochaic I have adapted to the sentimental; in the longer lines (Tetrameter), to the more tender and pathetic; in the shorter (Dimeter), to the lighter and more exhilarant. Here, too, in lines of equal length, the character varies, as the measure is complete or incomplete (Acatalectic or Catalectic); in the former case, the movement being more gentle; in the latter, more spirited. I have aimed at classic imagery and sentiment in all these pieces, except the first Trochaic, the character of which is rather modern; but such is the dominant influence of the Subjective in modern poetry, that I am conscious I have not attained, as well as I could wish, to the purer Objective of the ancients.] ELEGIAC. O, it is great for our country to die, where ranks are contending! Bright is the wreath of our fame; Glory awaits us for aye,— Glory, that never is dim, shining on with a light never ending,— Glory, that never shall fade, never, O, never away! O, it is sweet for our country to die! How softly reposes Warrior youth on his bier, wet by the tears of his love, Wet by a mother's warm tears. They crown him with garlands of roses, Weep, and then joyously turn, bright where he triumphs above. Not to the shades shall the youth descend, who for country hath perished: Hebe awaits him in heaven, welcomes him there with her smile; There, at the banquet divine, the patriot spirit is cherished; Gods love the young, who ascend pure from the funeral pile. Not to Elysian fields, by the still, oblivious river; Not to the isles of the blest, over the blue-rolling sea; But on Olympian heights shall dwell the devoted for ever; There shall assemble the good, there the wise, valiant, and free. O, then, how great for our country to die, in the front rank to perish, Firm with our breast to the foe, victory's shout in our ear! Long they our statues shall crown, in songs our memory cherish; We shall look forth from our heaven, pleased the sweet music to hear. IAMBIC. My heart is sad, my hope is gone, my light has fled; I sit and mourn, in silent grief, the lingering day. Ah! never more he comes, my love; among the dead, O far, O far, his fleeting shade has flown away! Far o'er the dark and dismal wave, whence no return, In deepest night he wanders now, a shape of air: He hears me not,—hears not the sighs, with love that burn; I see no more that form, so bright, so young and fair. O, bright and fair, as shapes that oft from Heaven descend, And on Parnassus stand before the setting sun! Bright, when he moved in shining arms, home to defend; Bright, when, a champion strong, the eager race he run: O fair, as rose and lily fair, when they entwine, In asphodelian meads, their wreath of virgin bloom! His heart was kind as brave; O, he was doubly mine! But now I only weep beside his early tomb. Death, with inverted torch, the young and gentle death, Weeps o'er him now, and mourns the plucked and withered flower: All bloom must fade;—the south-wind breathes its withering breath, And the clear-blowing north sweeps on, with blasting power. I too must soon be gone; in grief I glide away: The rose has left my cheek; my eye looks dim through tears. Come, gentle death! here with the youth in silence lay My form, ere it has felt the icy touch of years. ANACREONTIC. Come, crown my cup with roses With wine now brim it over: My heart in joy reposes; Around it pleasures hover. The nectar sparkles brightly, With light from love's full quiver: Come, drain it, drain it lightly, And shout: Io for ever! With wreathen ivy crown me, Dark-eyed Æolian maiden! In sweet oblivion drown me, Till deep with joy o'erladen. I sink in blissful slumber, And dream of love and Zoe; Till, at some merry number, I wake, and shout: Evoe! I seize my lyre,—loud ringing, It bounds beneath my fingers: To frantic dances springing, What heart so cold it lingers? Toss, toss, the vine-clad thyrses! Wine fires: extol the giver. Shout, with a cry that pierces The soul: Io for ever! ANAPESTIC. [I. In the silence of night, and in solemn array, by the glimmer of torches, is wheeling] In the silence of night, and in solemn array, by the glimmer of torches, is wheeling, Majestic, the funeral train, on its way, and its music is plaintively stealing,— Is plaintively stealing, in echoes, afar, awaking emotions of sorrow; It mourns, how the youth march to-day to the war, but return to us never to-morrow. Spear and buckler reversed, slow the army moves on, its standards and banners low trailing: Not a shout now is heard for the victory won; all is hushed, but the flute softly wailing. Light and still glide their steps, and in unison all, attuned to their solemn emotion; One faint, hollow murmur is heard at each fall, like the far-echoed roar of the ocean. Home, in urns, they are bearing the dust of the dead, dark veils o'er each urn low depending: How sacred the relics of those who have bled, for hearth and for altar contending! Not a trophy they rear, till they lay in the tomb, the ashes that sleep there in glory,— Till their pæans are sung, and the words that illume, transmit their proud record to story. So on through the streets of the city they move, and the old and the young there attend them: They meet them with greetings of sorrow and love,—fondly welcome the brave who defend them; And they weep from their hearts, as each urn passes by, a child or a parent enclosing: As he left them, his patriot bosom beat high; now in death he is darkly reposing. [II. O, waken the music of battle] O, waken the music of battle! Let the clash of the cymbals ring loudly, As the spears on the shields dash and rattle, When onward the youth rushes proudly: Let the horn and the trumpet, resounding In long rolling echoes, inspire us, Till our hearts like the billow are bounding, And omens of victory fire us. Hark the shout!—far its echo is rolling; Eleleu! Eleleu! swells it onward: Sword and shield clang in time, high controlling Each hero, quick hurrying vanward. On the foe moves in line, firm and steady, To the soft breath of flutes slow advancing; Drawn each sword, poised each spear, all are ready; Bright the sun on their plumed helms is glancing. To the charge! like the rush of the ocean,— Like torrents, from mountain-tops dashing Down the gulf, where, in mingled commotion, Crag and wood 'mid the white flood are crashing. Hark the shock! shield on shield rings, rebounding: As a rock firmly set, they repel it. On again, louder Eleleus sounding; Ours such fire, not the Spartan can quell it. TROCHAIC. [I. Softly sweet the song is stealing, softly through the night afar] Softly sweet the song is stealing, softly through the night afar; Faint and low the bell is pealing; dim, through haze, the light of star; Hushed and still is all around me; cold and still my brooding heart: Sure some magic spell hath bound me,—bid, O bid the spell depart! O, that song, so softly breathing,—how it flows into my soul! Memory then her twine unwreathing, tears of young emotion roll: And, as far the knell is tolling, how my spirit floats away, Over years, like billows, rolling, to the scenes where youth was gay! But the night, so hushed around me, and the sky, so dim above, In a lonely trance have bound me,—trance of mingled grief and love. Still on early fondness dwelling, faded bloom of vernal years; All I hear, the sigh faint swelling; all I feel, my trickling tears. [II. Maids are sitting by the fountain] Maids are sitting by the fountain; Bright the moon o'er yonder mountain O'er her shepherd watching lonely, On his sleep she looketh only. Softly whispering by the fountain, Oft they look unto the mountain, Think how, through the midnight hours, There the shepherd sleeps on flowers. Clear the fountain wave is gleaming; Still the happy youth is dreaming: Chastest love is watching o'er him; Crouched his faithful dog before him. Now the bubbling wave is sparkling; Now beneath a shadow darkling: O'er the moon a cloud is stealing; Passes now, her light revealing. Night-winds o'er the fountain blowing, Like Æolian music flowing, Far their warbled breath is gliding, Swelling, trembling, then subsiding. Of the shepherd on the mountain Sing the maids beside the fountain: Each then seems in air to hover, Watching o'er her sleeping lover. [III. See the bounding bark afloat] See the bounding bark afloat! Steady blows the willing gale! Joy, with merry, merry note, Hoists and spreads the purple sail. Far away, O far away! I must cross the dashing sea; So, my dearest, do not stay,— Boldly cross the wave with me. To the far Elysian isles, 'Mid the ocean, in the west, Where the sky for ever smiles, All the year one halcyon rest,— Shall we thither speed our flight? Only cross the wave with me, I shall find, my love and light, All Elysian with thee. On the dark Cimmerian strand, Where eternal shadows reign; Where Caucasian summits stand, Towering o'er the untrodden plain; Where, along the fatal shore, Music lulls the soul to death; Wastes, that hear the lion's roar; Sands, where kills the dragon's breath: Or in flowery gardens, where Bends the lotus, passing sweet; Vales, where roses fill the air; Meads, where silent waters meet, Lingering on through asphodel;— With thee, all alike would be: If with me thou deign to dwell, All Elysian smiles to me. PART II. [In the present section, several varieties of ancient measures are attempted, in addition to those in the preceding. In the series of Dactylics, the effect of the different degrees of Catalexis is, if I mistake not, clearly evident; that on one syllable (as in the Hexameter II. and in the Pentameter and Tetrameter here given) leading to a more subdued or sustained expression; and that on two syllables (as in the Heroic Hexameter I.), to a higher and more energetic expression, peculiarly suited to the Epic; while the Acatalectic (complete) termination on three syllables gives a fuller expression, approaching the magniloquent, or a lighter movement, verging on levity. The Hypercatalectic termination of the Hexameter (IV.), which is really a Heptameter, Catalectic on one syllable, presents a very singular measure, as happy in its expression as it is difficult of execution. The Iambic Tetrameter Catalectic (I.) is the “O Miss Baily!” measure, so much a favorite in Romaic poetry, as in the ?????? ????????????? of Christopoulos. This is strikingly different, in its light, tripping movement, from the corresponding Acatalectic verse (II.), which is always marked, more or less, by a slow and dignified or plaintive expression, similar to that of the Tragic Iambic (Part I.). The Choriambic, from the natural pause between the measures, has a bounding, but at the same time energetic movement, which may, by changing the pause to a slide, become subdued and flowing. But a continuous series of Choriambics has a monotonous effect, and doubtless for this reason they were usually accompanied with other feet, particularly as terminations. Thus the Choriambic (I.) has an Iambic (Catalectic) termination, or its equivalent; while the Choriambic Polyschematist consists of two members, each with an Iambic termination (the first complete, the second Catalectic). The Choriambic (II.) is composed of a pure series of Choriambics, but is so arranged, if I mistake not, as to give, in most instances, an easy slide from one measure to another, thus relieving the natural abruptness of the verse. The two specimens, under the head of Glyconic and Pherecratean, differ only in the distribution of the two varieties of verse combined; the latter specimen forming the verse called Priapeian by the ancients. The specimen marked Eupolidean and Cratinean, consists of a stanza of the former verse, followed by one of the latter; the two differing so little, as to be readily combined in the same series. The Epionic (Polyschematist), like the Choriambic Polyschematist, consists of two members, the last of which, as in the latter, is one syllable shorter than the first. The Asynartete verse is characterized by a change of movement in the middle of the line; the first member, in this instance, beginning with the accent (arsis); the second, with an unaccented syllable (thesis). An instance of such verse occurs in the first half of the stanza in Lay XII. (p. 269), where the lines are alternately Trochaic and Iambic. This verse corresponds to the succession of verses or strains in music, beginning alternately with full and broken measures, an instance of which occurs in the Barcarole in Masaniello. This alternation, both in poetry and music, produces an effect at once striking and pleasing. Several of the varieties of verse here attempted might form agreeable stanzas, even in our inflexible language, particularly if the hemistichs were written in distinct lines. This is more especially true of the Glyconic and Pherecratean, the Eupolidean and Cratinean, the Asynartete, and the two Polyschematists. All the specimens in the first part, and all thus far in the second, are rhymed, which undoubtedly relieves the ear not a little in adapting itself to measures so unusual, particularly to the longer lines, such as the Hexameters and the Dipodial Tetrameters. A few specimens of unrhymed Horatian stanzas are also given in the present section, viz. the Sapphic, Alcaic, and two Asclepiadian, corresponding respectively to those of the second, ninth, sixth, and fifth odes of the first book. In all these, I have endeavored to follow as near as possible the ancient quantity. The Sapphic consequently differs essentially in its rhythm from that of the English accentual Sapphic. The Galliambic and the Saturnian verse I have adapted not inappropriately to Roman subjects. The former is immortalized in the Atys of Catullus, while in the latter we have a genuine Latin measure, in which not improbably the old ballads of early Rome were composed. This, too, is Asynartete in its structure; a fact perhaps connected with the similar movement in some of the popular airs of the Italians, above alluded to.] DACTYLIC HEXAMETER. I. Heroic. Bard of the bright Chian isle, from snow-crowned Olympus descending, Come to my spirit at night, thy own full ecstasy lending: Bear me away through thy world, still with youth's first energy glowing; Still with the great and the fair in wide effusion o'erflowing. Other creations may fade, to shapeless ruin decaying: Over the world of thy song, youth's earliest dawn is still playing. Long the tall turrets of Troy have perished, by centuries riven,— Still at thy bidding they rise, untouched and immortal, to heaven. Still rise her sons in their might, dark plumes o'er their helmets wide waving,— Armed for their altars and homes, the god and the warrior braving. Hector still burns in the fight, awhile the wild torrent controlling; Then, like the thunderer's, in wrath, the car of Achilles is rolling. Ever new forms, at thy touch, to life and to beauty are starting;— Helen still wins with her smile; Andromache trembles at parting; Lone sits the hero apart, by the shore of the sea wide resounding; Light o'er the high purple wave the fair-freighted vessel is bounding. Still through the darkness of night the grief-stricken monarch is stealing, Falls at the feet of his foe, and melts him to tenderest feeling. Nature! thy power is supreme; no proud-hearted victor can sway thee; When thy soft whisper is heard, the strong and the mighty obey thee. [II. Deep, 'mid the shades of night, I sink in silent repose] Deep, 'mid the shades of night, I sink in silent repose; Pressed by the soft touch of sleep, my lids on the outer world close; But to the eye of my soul a fairer vision unfolds, That, with a charm of delight, my spirit long wondering holds. There are the bright forms of youth, creations too lovely to stay: Ever they come in my dreams,—I wake, and they hasten away. Over my pillow they hover, as clouds o'er the far golden west, When, in the soft-heaving wave, Day sinks to the couch of his rest. There rise, in beauty, the shapes that gladdened in earliest time, Where spread the lily and rose, full-bloomed, in Ionia's clime: Nymphs, too, of forest and grove, of fountain and blue-rolling deep, Still, with their dark-beaming eyes, fond watch o'er the slumberer keep. Still, from the high walls of heaven, the gods in their glory descend; Still, to the bold-bearing youth, their power and their spirit they lend; Still, o'er the dark-rolling clouds, triumphant they ride in their cars; Still, from victorious death, the demigod mounts to the stars. Eldest and highest of bards! thy song, with its music divine, Rolls through this magical world, my spirit has raised for its shrine. Still, as when first from thy lyre its tones in harmony stole, Breathes, through the silence of night, its influence deep in my soul. [III. Still, as in youth, ever green, the laurel of Homer is flourishing] Still, as in youth, ever green, the laurel of Homer is flourishing; Life-giving streams bathe its roots, its wide-waving foliage nourishing: Light, from the ever-bright throne, still over its summit is hovering, Blossom and leaf, as they wave, still with heavenly radiance covering. And, as I look to its sky-piercing summit, an eagle has taken me, Bears me aloft, where the blasts from Olympus to keener life waken me. Hail to the herald, whose cloud-cleaving pinion from earth can deliver me! Nothing below from the high train of bards and of heroes shall sever me. [IV. Herald of earliest dawn! at thy smile the blue waters are stirring again] Herald of earliest dawn! at thy smile the blue waters are stirring again: Wide the sea wakes from its sleep, as thy bright eye enkindles the sky and the main. As the wind flutters thy locks, and plays with the folds of thy many-dyed veil, Boldly we launch on the deep, and deck with thy purple the snow of our sail. Earth then gives tokens of life, and again, as a giant refreshed with repose, Youthfully starts from its dreams, and its cheeks are all flushed with the bloom of the rose. Phosphor leads on thy bright train, and waves his clear torch, as the night steals away; Then come the light-footed hours, and with soft hands unfold the fair portals of day: Forth on thy rose-wreathen car, thou rollest 'mid billows of saffron and gold; Loves, on their thin iris wings, the red-streaming mists, as thy canopy, hold. Gracefully ever at morn, thy car thus aloft o'er the mountain is borne; And as thou comest, the woods ring aloud with the clang of the welcoming horn. DACTYLIC PENTAMETER. Spirit of hope and of joy, who, in holiest day, Dwellest 'mid ever-bright flowers, from thy home of delight, Come to me still as a friend, 'mid the visions of night,— Bear me, on pinions of love, to thy heaven away. There, where the fountains of life in the clear morning play, Bathing the blossoms around with their freshening dew, Waking for ever the rose, its sweet youth to renew, Couched on the ever-green grass, I would lingering stay. Blest with thy presence alone, I would ever remain, Live on thy smile and thy song:—wouldst thou ever be near, Breathing the tones of thy heart, as a lute, in my ear, Never the cold realm of earth should possess me again. O, shall I never be free from this heart-crushing chain? Shall the fond dreams of my youth be around me no more? Shall there no bright morning dawn, to revive and restore? Fondly I look to thy aid;—let me look not in vain! DACTYLIC TETRAMETER. Ever thou comest, at even and morn,— Comest, attended with flute and with horn: Over the mountain, and over the hill, Lightly and brightly thou hoverest still. All the gay rites of thy worship are gone; All the bright train that once graced thee have flown: Not even the fauns with their whistles would stay; They too have fled through the forests away: But thou, enchantress, still ever art nigh,— Breathest, at even and dawn, from the sky. Softly the west-wind now wafts thee along,— Wafts over meadow and valley thy song: Then the wild songster is hushed at thy flight; Silent he pauses, entranced in delight. Naiads have vanished from fountain and stream; Nymph of the forest has fled, like a dream; Down in the depth of the blue-rolling deep, Pillowed for ever, the sea-maidens sleep: Spirit of melody! still thou art nigh,— Breathest, at even and dawn, from the sky. IAMBIC TETRAMETER. [I. Aurora rises o'er the hills, by graceful hours attended] Aurora rises o'er the hills, by graceful hours attended, And in her train a merry troop of bright-eyed loves are blended. Away they fly, o'er wood and wild, o'er lake and winding river; And as they fly, the kindling sky is growing brighter ever. The world now wakes, and silence flies to cave of lonely mountain: The deer steal from their forest glades; the birds sing o'er the fountain: The cottage smoke, o'er vale and plain, in many a curl, is flowing; And guided by the tinkling bell, the herd afield is going. The level sunbeams touch the lake,—its sheeted wave is flashing; And brighter still, from eastward hill, the waterfall is dashing: The plashing wheel revolves below,—a shower of light is round it; Those orient hues, the drops diffuse, with mazy circles bound it. O, gay the plastic dreams of old, the world their touch created! The poet's eye, with fervent gaze, still o'er it broods unsated. Fair forms still haunt the forest-wild, still dwell by shady river: Their loveliness shall never fade; their bloom is fresh for ever. [II. O, turn not, dearest, on me so!—I cannot bear that grief of thine] O, turn not, dearest, on me so!—I cannot bear that grief of thine: Thy sorrow stealeth to my heart,—there silently it feedeth mine. The grief I feel, I would subdue, and then would wipe thy tears away; But while I see thee sorrowing so, this gloom around my heart will stay. O, let me only catch one smile, like morning's glance from drop of dew! O, let the soft light flow again, that once so filled thy eye of blue! O, tell me so, thy heart hath peace!—like withered flowers revived by rain, Gay thoughts would open in my heart, and fond emotions bloom again. CHORIAMBIC. [I. Bear me afar over the wave, far to the sacred islands] Bear me afar over the wave, far to the sacred islands, Where ever bright blossoms the plain, where no cloud hangs on the highlands: There be my heart ever at rest, stirred by no wild emotion; There on the earth only repose, halcyon calm on the ocean. Lay me along, pillowed on flowers, where steals in silence for ever, Over its sands, still as at noon, far the oblivious river. Scarce through the grass whispers it by; deep in its wave you may number Pebble and shell, and image of flower, folded and bent in slumber. Spirit of life! rather aloft, where, on the crest of the mountain, Clear blow the winds, fresh from the north, sparkles and dashes the fountain, Lead me along, hot in the chase, still 'mid the storm high glowing: Only we live—only, when life, like the wild torrent, is flowing. [II. When the blue wave sinks on the sea, and the still night hushes the deep] When the blue wave sinks on the sea, and the still night hushes the deep, Ever my soul hastens to thee, ever thy smile blesses my sleep. Then a few hours, blest, thou art nigh; then, too, as once, thou art my own: But when the dawn kindles the sky, sadly I wake,—far thou hast flown. Canst thou not take me in thy flight, when with the dawn thou art no more? Fairer thou seemest, spirit of heaven, though thou didst seem fairest before. Now thou art gone, earth all is dark;—O, wilt thou ne'er bear me away? Here only night deadens my soul,—yonder alone, yonder is day! CHORIAMBIC POLYSCHEMATIST. Come to the dance! awake! awake! bound with the music lightly! Evening is falling on the lake,—flashes the mirror brightly. Come, where the elm is arching high, bent with its purple treasure: Bid to the toil of day good-by,—yield to the call of pleasure! Come to the dance, ye maidens fair! gayly the song invites you: Joy with his golden lamp is there,—on to the ring he lights you. Circle around the festive tree! then, as the music wakes you, Trip to its measures, light and free,—flit, where in sport it takes you! Haste to the dance, away, away! viol and lute attend you: Evening winds, as with flowers they play, sweets from the rose-buds send you. Haste to the dance! the music calls!—haste to the smile of lover! Soon the chilly night-dew falls,—then must the dance be over. GLYCONIC AND PHERECRATEAN. [I. Hark! the echo of shout and song] Hark! the echo of shout and song! See the bacchanals troop along! Loud the cymbals are sounding. Then, as wildly they onward pour, Swells the drum, with its hollow roar, Deep from cavern rebounding. Quick the Graces, with timid flight, Far retire to the forest-night, Scared, as the din is pealing. Gentle Nymphs to the thicket fly, Wait till the tumult has hurried by, Racked each tenderer feeling. Such the tumult and din of life; So it rushes, in storm and strife Flies the ideal before it: And as its discord rolls along, Still is the gentle voice of song: Only can peace restore it. [II. Bright ascends the festal dawn; bright the temple is flashing] Bright ascends the festal dawn; bright the temple is flashing: Wide a nation is rolling on; spear and armor are clashing. Garlands circle each helmet there, high on standard are glancing: Shouts are filling the vernal air; gayly the youth are dancing. So they haste to the sacred games,—wild each bosom is beating: Victory high each soul enflames,—loud the champion's greeting. Swiftly flies the race of car and steed,—far sweeps the dust to heaven: Glorious shines the conqueror's meed, when by a nation given. EUPOLIDEAN AND CRATINEAN. When the Spring has wakened the flowers, and the day is warm and still,— When the rose has woven its bowers,—be my haunt the sunny hill. Then as breathes the whispering air, o'er my head the cloudless sky, Dreams from heaven visit me there,—holy visions pass me by. Silently sleep the woods around; mute the sheeted river flows; Hushed, as in death, the world of sound; voiceless, too, the zephyr blows: But to my heart a music steals, faint at first, then full and clear; Deep in my soul, from Heaven it peals,—borne as from some celestial sphere. EPIONIC. What joy at even to hear thee, sweet voice of tenderest love! How blest, alone to be near thee, thou soft and sorrowing dove! Thou seemest all sad and forsaken; thy song dies sobbing away: But yet, as I hear thee, I waken; thou singest of love and of May. And oft in summer thou sittest, concealed in shadowy pine, Or where, in loneliest valley, the tangled cedars entwine. Beneath their shadow reposing, in dim, mysterious light, I hear thy song, at its closing, like voice of spirit at night. 'Tis ever pleasant to hear thee,—I always welcome thy song; For gentle the feelings thou wakest,—the heart can indulge them long. A strain of livelier measure may rouse and quicken its play; But short and fleeting the pleasure,—the gentle only can stay. ASYNARTETE. Merrily, merrily rings the joyous shout of harvest-home: Merrily, merrily springs the homeward bark through dashing foam. Gayly the villagers leap, as red and ripe the vintage flows: Lightly and brightly they sweep, the glancing swords, as the conflict glows. Bursts, in its fulness, the heart, in laugh and shout, in festive song; So when the labor is done,—so when toil strives along. Hope cheers the combatant on; in pride and joy the victor sings: Crows, 'mid the fight, the cock,—conqueror then claps his wings. GALLIAMBIC. The clouds roll from the mountains; the storm sweeps o'er the plain; And the boldest shrink in terror; the proudest shake with fear. The scared soldiers are flying, 'mid hail and dashing rain; And the ground thickly is covered with scattered shield and spear. With loud burst, as of thunder, 'mid a wide whirlwind of fire, From the high heaven, in glory, descends the god of war. The fearless hero, exulting, beholds his warrior sire; And he mounts, joyous, beside him, the bright triumphal car. Aloft sweeps it to heaven, and the white steeds, as they fly Over clouds, rolling like surges, are dashing the lightnings around. The eye in vain can follow their quick flight through the sky; From mountain far to mountain, they leap at every bound. Weep not your king, ye Romans! for he now is a god above. Late, when alone, I saw him, and he rose like a tower of light. Lofty and stern, he met me: he seemed like a son of Jove. Far through the darkness glittered his armor, intensely bright. “Go now, and tell my people!” he spake in solemn tone, And as I heard, I trembled, and listened with holiest awe; “I am their guardian genius; I dwell by the highest throne: Bid them be wise and temperate, and reverent to faith and law!” SATURNIAN. A shout, a shout for Cocles, brave among the bravest! For he the bridge defended, and fearless swam the river. A wreath for noble Cocles,—a civic wreath for ever! He saved our sacred city,—glory crown the hero! A shout, a shout for Cocles! Tell the gallant story, O, tell it to your children, and they shall tell it further. On the bridge he fronted all Porsenna's army: Spear and arrow round him flew,—alone he braved them. A shout, a shout for Cocles! Now the bridge is broken, And see! he plunges headlong in the foaming river. He stems the flood undaunted; his joyous friends embrace him; He has saved our city:—twine the wreath around him! SAPPHIC. Soft he sleeps, where floweth the winding river: Winds blow light; they dare not awake the sleeper,— One so young and lovely, so full of beauty, Grandeur, and glory. Soft he sleeps, a child on his cross reposing,— Smiles in peace, unknowing of future sorrows; Bright and pure, as spirit of life,—as rose-bud, Fresh in his beauty. Yet that look reveals, in its pensive sweetness, Deep and holy love, that will after lead him Forth to heal and save, and to higher being Kindly allure us. Now that cross the couch, where he sweetly slumbers: When his deeds of love have alarmed and maddened, On that cross, in death, he shall yield his spirit Back to its heaven. ALCAIC. To arms! to arms! the trumpet is summoning. What heart is cold, when glory awakens us! When youth, for hearth and shrine contending, Rush to the shock, and in death are happy! A holy feeling stirs, as the signal sounds. To die for home, how high and how glorious! The recreant only hears and trembles. Give me my sword,—I will haste and meet them! Raise high the song,—the foe is discomfited! Our sacred soil untouched and unsullied! With laurel wreathed, by loved ones greeted, Proudly we move, as the pæan echoes. ASCLEPIADIAN. [I. Not for wealth or for power, conquest or victory] Not for wealth or for power, conquest or victory, Not for shout and applause, honor and dignity, Speeds my soul to the strife; higher and holier Is the feeling that wakens me. Duty calls me to yield life and its happiness, Calls me to part from friend, part from a dearer one; Duty calls, and I know honors immortal wait, Even when earth has forgotten me. So I rush to the strife,—rush where the bravest yield. They only look to renown; mightier impulses Bear me on, as with wings,—on, till, victorious, Death I greet as the foe retires. [II. When the rose is in bloom, violets opening] When the rose is in bloom, violets opening, Fresh and dewy, their leaves, let me, in early morn, Wake the slumbering echoes, Till the mountains have caught the sound: Till from loftiest height, deep to the winding dell, Cave and forest repeat, vocal, my minstrelsy, As if dryad were greeting Sweetly the tones of my Alpine horn. Or when twilight grows dim, far in the rosy west, And o'er green wood and crag sparkles the evening star, Let me hear, in the distance, Faintly the voice of the vesper hymn. Where the lake spreads its wave, clear to the rising moon, O'er the water it steals, whispers along the shores, As if song of Undine Rose from her hall in the deep below. SONGS FOR NATIONAL AIRS. [The following songs have been written to accompany different National Airs, and compose but a small part of an extended series. The verse has been formed in all, except those adapted to the German airs, on the rhythm of the music, not exactly note for note, but so as to give a corresponding flow and expression. In the German series, the verse of the original German songs has been followed, with a few slight deviations, in most instances, to suit more exactly the rhythm of the airs. The Norwegian airs are taken from Derwent Conway's Journey through Norway, &amp;c. The German series is taken from an old German Convivial Song-Book (Taschenbuch fur Freunde der Freude). The airs of the first ten were composed by J. A. P. Schultz; those of the remaining eight, by J. F. Reichardt. The mottos prefixed indicate the original songs and their authors. The Russian specimens are from a small collection of Russian popular airs accompanying Götze's Collection of Russian Popular Poetry (Stimmen des Russischen Volks in Liedern): the Bohemian from an extensive series of popular airs accompanying the Collection of Bohemian Popular Poetry by Ritter von Rittersberg (Czeske Narodnj Pjsnie): the Gaelic, from a small collection of genuine Gaelic airs, in Logan's Scottish Gael: and the Welsh, except the Rising of the Lark, from a collection of old Welsh tunes in E. Jones's Bardic Museum. It is hardly necessary to remark, that the poetry is, in most instances, adapted to the national or particular character of the air or song which it was intended to accompany.] NORWEGIAN. I. National Air. Ye sons of sires who fought and bled For liberty and glory, Whose fame shall ever wider spread Till Time is bent and hoary, Awake to meet the invading foe! Rouse at the call of danger! Beat down again his standard low, And backward hurl the stranger! They knew no fear, those sires of old,— 'Mid swords and bayonets clashing, Still high they bore their banner's fold, Its stars, like lightnings, flashing. Be like those sires! With freeborn might Renew the deeds of story! Who lives, shall win a wreath of light! Who falls, shall sleep in glory! II. Mountain Air. Sons of the chase, awake! Haste, see the morning break! Wake to the horn! Ere fades the morning star, Echoes, 'round crag and scar, Proudly its blast afar,— Far rings the horn! Hark to the bay of hound, Tossed from the mountains 'round! Hark to the horn! Mount,—mount, and hark-away! Bright dawns the glorious day,— Soon we 've the stag at bay: Loud wind the horn! GERMAN. I. The Flower of Liberty. “Es giebt der Plätzchen überall.”— Stollberg. There is no land so fair and bright As this, where first I drew the light: There is no land so dear to me As this, that bears the strong and free, The cradle-home of liberty! Here blooms a sweeter flower, Than aught in orient bower. The flower of freedom, fair and bright, Here spreads its leaves of roseate light. Yes, freedom's flower here, fair and bright, Unfolds its leaves of roseate light! Though far around the world I roam, My heart still lingers for its home; And even where Spring for ever dwells Each flower I meet but only tells Of that for which my bosom swells. The flower that graces free Thy temple, Liberty! Though far away my steps may roam, That flower still wins me back to home. Yes, far away my steps may roam,— That flower still wins me back to home. II. The Chain of Love. “Wir trinken, kühl umschattet.”— Voss. O, there are links that bind us, Of magic power,— The links, that softly twined us In Eden's hour. Joy wreathes his flowers around them, And love with silk has bound them. O, there 's a charm, no tongue can tell; But still the heart, with hidden swell, Can speak it well! That chain,—the freeman wears it With generous pride: That chain,—the hero bears it, With haughty stride. Yes, lion hearts receive it, As fairy fingers weave it. Subdued by love, they still can dare The battle-field, and fearless there Its dangers share! III. The Patriot. “Dass nie ein Land zu keiner Zeit.”— Baggesen. Who loves his country, firm will stand To meet the fierce invader; Will lift his sword, with earnest hand, To aid her. He knows no fear, when danger calls The patriot to his country's walls: When danger forth the patriot calls, Fearless he fights, and willing falls. So stood our fathers, side by side, In freedom's cause victorious, When back recoiled the invading tide, Inglorious. And when our country calls again, O, be her voice not heard in vain! When loud our country calls again, Our home shall be the tented plain! IV. Wealth of Soul. “Freund, ich achte nicht des Mahles.”— Voss. Not for gold, and not for splendor; Not for crown or throne;— No, never will my soul surrender What it holds its own. They may dote on piles of treasure,— They may swim in streams of pleasure,— Poor their gain! Poor their gain! Poor, ah! poor beyond all measure! Vain, O, vain! Only slavery's chain. Not for all that wealth can offer Would I check my soul,— No, not for regal bounty, suffer Slavery's base control. Ever in my own dominion, I would mount on eagle's pinion, Free as light! Free as light! Far above the tyrant's minion, Wing my flight, Nerved with strong delight. V. The Festive Evening. “Friert der Pol mit kaltem Schimmer.”— Voss. Cheerful glows the festive chamber; In the circle pleasure smiles: Mounts the flame, like wreaths of amber; Bright as love its warmth beguiles. Glad the heart with joy is lighted; Hand with hand, in faith, is plighted, As around the goblet flows. Fill,—fill,—fill, and quaff the liquid rose! Bright it glows,— O, how bright the bosom glows! Pure as light our social meeting: Here no passion dares invade. Joys we know, not light and fleeting; Flowers we twine that never fade. Ours are links, not time can sever: Brighter still they glow for ever,— Glow in yon eternal day. No,—no,—no, ye will not pass away Ye will stay,— Social joys, for ever stay! VI. Our Country. “Bekränzt mit Laub den lieben vollen Becher.”— Claudius. The vine may glow, with purple clusters bending, Where proudly flows the Rhine, Or, richer pomp to classic ruins lending, Round tower and temple twine. We need no vine our country's hills to brighten: We need no boasted wine. Be ours the sails, that o'er the ocean whiten, Around the masted pine. Be ours the nervy hands that spread and furl them, With gallant hearts to dare,— Ours freedom's bolts, with sinewy arms to hurl them, When threatening comes the war. Mild as the morn, in peace, our starry splendor Afar shall light the main. That flag may perish,—never shall surrender To boastful pride again! VII. Washington. “Füllt an die Gläser, füllt bis oben.”— Voss. Fill, fill your glasses,—brim them over! We drink a health of high renown! No patriot brow shall glory ever With brighter wreaths of honor crown! Our country's Sire!—with fond emotion, With firm resolve, and deep devotion, Around our Union's altar-flame, Here we invoke his sacred name! That name shall be our watchword ever When danger threats, or foe is nigh. Cursed be the hand that dare dissever The holy bond we prize so high. Do thou, blest shade! this Union cherish; Thy memory here shall never perish. Long as thy deeds shall here remain. O, bind us in thy golden chain! VIII. Liberty. “Im Hut der Freyheit stimmet an—” Beneath our country's flag we stand, And give our hearts to thee, Bright power, who steel'st and nerv'st our hand, Thou first born, Liberty! Here, on our swords, we swear to give Our willing lives, that thou mayst live! For thee, the Spartan youth of old, To death devoted, fell; Thy spirit made the Roman bold, And fired the patriot Tell. Our sires, on Bunker, fought for thee,— Undaunted fought, and we are free! Run up our starry flag on high! No storm shall rend its folds; On, like a meteor, through the sky, Its steady course it holds. Thus high in heaven our flag unfurled, Go, bear it, Freedom, round the world! IX. The Banquet. “Dem Kindlein, das gebohren ward.”— Stollberg. Loud rings the golden cup of joy, Amid the banquet halls, And manhood, light as sportful boy, For mirth and music calls. Give loose to pleasure! send it free,— O, send it free, To roam in wildest liberty! CHORUS. Our hearts are free! They mount in wildest liberty! As bird on pinion swift and strong, In airy flight we play, And as a bird's, our festive song, Full echoing, floats away. Joy crowns the banquet! We are free! O, we are free! But pure and high our liberty! CHORUS. Yes, we are free; But pure and high our liberty! X. Spring. “Der Frühling ist gekommen.”— Stollberg. The Spring, the Spring is coming; The birds are merrily singing: The Spring, the Spring is coming; We hear the nightingale,— In shade of rose, at evening, We hear the nightingale. The yellow buds are breaking; The flowers in meadow are blowing; And gentle winds are playing Along the grassy vale, Around the airy mountain, And down the grassy vale. The Spring, the Spring is with us, And light the swallow is flitting; The Spring, the Spring is with us,— It brings the nightingale,— In cool of shady evening, It brings the nightingale. XI. The Seasons. “Der Herbst beginnt.”— Schulz. The Spring is gone, And, one by one, The blossoms are withered and faded: The Summer, too, Is almost through, And thinner the fountain is shaded. Come, Autumn, come! Thou lead'st me home: The birds of the Summer are flying. Thou wilt not stay, But steal'st away, And Winter behind thee is sighing. The stars are bright, This winter night: The lake is merrily ringing. The skater there, To the frosty air, His open bosom is flinging. But Spring again Shall wake the plain, And showers the blossoms sprinkle. As through the vale Light blows the gale, The lake shall curl and crinkle. And Summer, thou, With dripping brow, Shalt plunge in the shady river, When golden day Is on his way, And field and meadow quiver. But, Autumn, come! I welcome home Fallen leaves and faded flowers. Thy sky is blue, And soft as dew Thy still and gentle hours. XII. The Boatmen of the Rhine. “Ein Leben, wie im Paradies.”— Hölty. A joyous life, like Paradise, We lead along the Rhine, From where it springs 'mid glacier ice, To where it meets the brine. By mountain farm, and moated tower, By ancient town, we glide: By vine-clad hill, and fabled bower, By castled rock, we ride. 'Mid Alpine song we float along; Through field and meadow stray: Where grows the vine, in purple twine, We win our easy way. We left the free, brave Tell, with thee, Their earliest rights to keep: Now through a realm, that once was free, We hasten to the deep. XIII. Festivity. “Fröhlich tönt der Becherklang.”— Stollberg. Joyous rings the goblet's chime, In our merry meeting; And our cheerful hearts keep time, As the hours are fleeting. Wake the echoes round us! Friendship's chain has bound us! Only love can wound us! Fill your glasses,—fill them o'er! Drink, and care shall vex no more! Joy ascends on purple wings, Golden clouds around him: Lightly to the wind he flings Every chain that bound him. From his heaven descending, See him o'er us bending, Brightest influence lending! Fill your glasses,—fill them high! Quick as light, the minutes fly. XIV. Youth. “Rosen auf den Weg gestreut.”— Hölty. Roses strewed along my way, Round me songs of gladness, On I speed in youthful play; Mine nor care nor sadness. By me pleasure trips along, Maid with eye bright glancing; Round the woods repeat her song, As their leaves are dancing. Gayly thus we trip it on, Frolic youth and pleasure, Gayly, as the moments run By, in lightest measure. While the spring of life is new, Fresh its roses blowing, So its early joys pursue,— Quick the stream is flowing. XV. The Vintage. “Bekränzet die Tonnen.”— Hölty. The vines are deeply blushing; The vintage is nigh; And plenty is gushing, In showers, from the sky. Bright spirits are fleeting, On white clouds, along; And glad hearts are greeting Their presence with song. The youth and the maiden Now haste to the vine; The choicest of clusters They gracefully twine: With music and dances, They bear them away; Their toil is but pastime, Their labor is play. O'er hill, and o'er valley, Is calm and repose; The voice of the fountain Is hushed as it flows; The lake, too, is sleeping, Unruffled its breast: All nature is keeping A Sabbath of rest. The vintage is gathered; The harvest is in; The fruitage of autumn Is piled in its bin: The swallows are flitting To sunnier shore; We care not for Winter,— We 've plenty in store. XVI. Spring. “Freude jubelt; Liebe waltet.”— Matthisson. Mirth is shouting, joy is singing, Far o'er hill, o'er vale and plain! Love his merry flight is winging Through the flowery groves again. Even the secret forest feeleth, Trembling deep, his magic power. Round the hill, at evening, stealeth Music, gentle as the hour. Spring is with us,—flowers are blowing; Round their leaves the west-wind plays: As afar their breath is flowing, To their couch he hastes, and stays. Every sound, that nature utters, Blends in harmony with all,— Bee that hums, and leaf that flutters, Whispering wind, and waterfall. XVII. Evening. “Phöbus eilet, nach der Reise.”— Köpken. Evening o'er the vales descending, Fresh the wind from mountain blows; And the stars, their influence lending, Win the laborer to repose. Night resumes her silent reign,— Shadowy coolness soothes again! CHORUS. Blessings on her gentle reign! Coolness soothes our hearts again. Dimly o'er the mountain fading, Sunset glories die away. Night, each hue of beauty shading, Robes the earth in dun array. But she brings us still repose,— Soft our wearied eyelids close! CHORUS. Grateful is her still repose,— Pressed by sleep, our eyelids close! XVIII. Hope. “Hoffnung, Hoffnung, immer grün.”— Herder. Hope! thou art my only friend. When the light that shone around me All has fled, and grief has bound me, Though not love his influence lend, Thou, O Hope! art still my friend. All the flowers of life may wither, Friend and lover, glory, gold,— All may fly, we know not whither, But thy arms shall still enfold. Hope! thou ever art my friend. Though my dearest joys should leave me, Fate of all I loved bereave me, Thou a cheering light wilt send, Still, O Hope! my only friend. All that wins the heart is fleeting; Ere 't is known, it flits away, Ever from our grasp retreating: Thou, O Hope! alone wilt stay. RUSSIAN. I. The Battle Call. “Ach ty pole, moe pole czistoe—” “Ah! thou plain, my open plain!” Loud rings the battle trumpet, Far resounding, far swelling! Rouse, heroes, rouse to the conflict! See, yonder the dark foe Sweeps, like a winter storm! On speeds the fierce invader, Wild as ocean high-heaving! Strong nerve ye, boldly to meet him! Back hurl him, as dashed wave Rolls from the rock-bound shore! Earth far has shook beneath him, All-invading, all-subduing! Yet fear not,—country is sacred! Who arms for his loved home, Fights with the sword of Heaven! [II. Think, O think, how much thou lov'dst me] “Wspomni, wspomni, moy liubeznoy, Moiu prez'niuju liubov—” “Think, O think, beloved, Of my early love!” Think, O think, how much thou lov'dst me, When my cheek was fresh and fair! Do not coldly now forget me, Though its bloom has gone! Think how oft we sat together! Happy were our moments then. Then my eye was bright with pleasure,— Now 't is dimmed with tears. Like a rose was then my beauty, Rose that opens first in spring. Then my charms could more allure thee,— I could love not more. Leave, O, leave me not forsaken! I will love thee ever true. Pale my cheek, and sorrow-stricken,— Love still lights my soul. III. The Willow. “Iwuszka, iwuszka, zelenaia moia—” “Willow, my green willow!” Bright flows the meadow stream, and o'er it bends the willow;— There sat the maid I love, and wove her flowers in garlands: There sits no gentle maid;—O, canst thou tell me, willow, Where I can find the maid that sat at evening by thee? Light on the meadow stream there floats a rosy garland;— Fair maiden wove the flowers, and dropped them in the water. “Go, garland,” thus she said, “and whisper to my lover: True ever is thy love,—her heart will ne'er forget thee.” Low droops the willow-tree,—its leaf is pale and yellow: There flows no meadow stream,—the summer sun has dried it. Brown all the grass below,—no maiden gathers flowers; Sits there no more at eve, to weave her flowers in garlands. See! on the pebbles lies a soiled and withered garland;— Such is my withered heart, and so my hope has faded. False maiden wove the flowers, and cast them in the water;— Soon dried the stream away, and withered lay the garland. BOHEMIAN. I. Bird of the Mountain. “Lasstowiczka ljta, ljta, Powjda z'e swjta—” “The swallow is flying, is flying; He tells me it dawns.” Bird of the mountain, sweetly thou singest,— O, sweet thy song! Over the fountain, high in the branches, Thou sitt'st alone. There oft, at evening, I linger to hear thee: Bird of the mountain, sweetly thou singest,— O, sweet thy song! Bird of the mountain, why art thou ever So sad and lone? Only I hear thee breaking the silence So deep around. Art thou the spirit of heart-broken maiden? Bird of the mountain, why art thou ever So sad and lone? II. The Bird that has lost its Young. “Wy panenky sedlsky, ge was tu gen dwanact—” Why so sadly sing'st thou? Hast thou lost thy loved one? Why art thou so lonely, 'Mid the woods afar? “They have stolen all my young ones,— That is why so sad my song!” Cease thy song of sorrow! Spring is all around thee,— Other loves may bless thee,— Break not so thy heart! “They have stolen all my loved ones,— Other loves I cannot know!” III. Dushka. The two songs under this head were written to accompany the same air as differently modified in its time. The original time of the air is triple (3–4), with a syncopated note (a pointed fourth) in the middle of the first measure. The second song, not including the words in brackets, it is adapted to this time including the words in brackets, it is adapted to a triple time, in which the first measure is resolved into a uniform series of eights. This last modification has a much slower movement than the preceding, the absolute time of which is determined by the syncopated note in the first measure. The movement of the verse is determined, the other lines remaining the same, by the varying length of the first line: quicker when that is shorter, and slower when that is longer, that an equilibrium of time may be preserved throughout. The first song is adapted to the same air, in 6–8 time; moving by triplets, as the second by couplets of syllables. “Prawda a z'adna lez'—” I. Dushka, fairest of maidens! Long have I sought for thy love. Long have I courted thee; Long have I lingered; Yet not a smile have I won. Still thou art dear to me,— Ever art dear to me; Ever till death I am thine. Dushka, fairest of maidens! Give me, O, give me thy love! Dushka, fairest of maidens! Turn not so coldly away. Thou wilt remember me, When they have left thee, When all the faithless are gone. Then thou wilt think of me, Fondly wilt think of me, Know I am faithful and true. Dushka, fairest of maidens! Yield me, O, yield me thy heart! II. Dushka, fairest [dearest] maiden! Thou art still my only love. When the early blossom Of thy beauty fades, Thou wilt find me ever true. Other youths may leave thee When thy roses wither; Still my heart is ever thine. Dushka, fairest [dearest] maiden! Thou art still my only love. Dushka, fairest [dearest] maiden! Thou wilt ever be my love. Not, like bird of summer, Do I flit away; Even in winter I remain. I will never leave thee, Though the storm be rising; Then I'll press thee to my heart. Dushka, fairest [dearest] maiden! Thou wilt ever be my love. GAELIC. I. Homeward Bound. Air: “An Iorram Fhir a Bhata.”—(The Song of the Boatmen.) O'er the foaming sea, Far the ship hastens, To the green island Where my love dwells. There we meet, love; Never part more, Till our eyes close In their last sleep. Bear me swiftly on, Fresh and fair breezes, O'er the blue ocean;— Fill my white sail! For my heart longs For its dear home,— Longs to meet her Whom my youth loved. Yonder rises dim, O'er the dark waters, Far, the green island I have sought long. Speed thee, swift bark, As a dart flies! Soon my loved shore I shall greet again. II. The Tryst. Air: “Righil Thulaichean.”—(Tulloch Reel.) O come, lassie, come and meet me! Come, lassie, to the hazel! There, lassie, thou hast trysted, At the gloamin' hour to meet me. We will sit beneath its shadow, As the gloamin' light is fading, And the mist, along the meadow, All its dewy flowers is shading. We will sit and talk together,— Tell how much we love each other; As the lambs among the heather, Gentle aye to one another;— With a kiss of love and kindness, Then we'll part, to meet again. O, come, lassie, come and meet me! Come, lassie, to the hazel! There, lassie, thou hast trysted, At the gloamin' hour to meet me. O come, lassie, come and meet me! Come, when the lambs are faulding,— Come to the hazel, lassie! I'll be early there to meet thee. Thou wilt na' distrust thy laddie,— Truthful aye he 's been unto thee: He has ever loe'd thee, lassie,— He will ever dearly loe thee. Now the heather bells are swinging, And the gowany turf is glowing, Bright the saugh, and gay the rowan, Red the rose, and green the rashes, Meet me, lassie, by the hazel,— Meet me by the mountain burn! O, come, lassie, come and meet me! Come, when the lambs are faulding,— Come to the hazel, lassie! I'll be early there to meet thee. III. The Lover's Lament. Air: “Cuilfhionn.”—(The Holly.) O, closed the eye that beamed so kindly, Mild as the morn, when it first uncloses! O, pale the lip, that smiled so fondly, Pure, in its hue, as the dewy rose! O, like the rose, that lip has faded! Cold in the grave thy form reposes; Dark, dark as night, my soul is shaded; Full as the fountain, my heart now flows. Long shall I think of the hours when I sat with thee. Under the shade of the trysting tree, at silent gloaming; Long shall I dwell on the scenes I have viewed with thee; But I shall see thee no more again. Yet shall I never forget how I strayed with thee, Over the hills, in the sunny noon of April, roaming; Never forget how in childhood I played with thee, Hours, that, like thee, were without a stain. IV. Clan Donnal's Gathering. A Pibroch. Air: “Cogadh na Sith.”—(War or Peace.) Up, Clan Donnal! Wild rings the pibroch through glen and through valley; Loud peals the slogan, that calls you to war! Haste! Donnal's bold warriors on yonder hill rally; High blaze the bale-fires o'er heath and o'er mountain; And broad waves the standard, and streams afar. Up, Clan Donnal! Gird on the broadsword, and on with the tartan! Haste, where the pipes shrilly waken the echoes, For there is the gathering of Donnal to-day! Up, Clan Donnal! Haste ye from lake, and from glen, and from mountain, From forest and heath, from the well and the fountain, And rush ye, like eagles who sweep to their quarry, Or sons of the mountain, abroad on their foray, Nor think of aught else, but the loved ones behind you, Who faithful defenders, in battle, shall find you. So up, and away! Up, Clan Donnal! Haste to the gathering, as hounds in the morning Speed where the horn rings o'er heath and o'er hill! Haste! Clansmen should spring as the pipes give their warning,— Dash from their heights, like a flood from its fountain, When swelled by the burst of a cloud to its fill. Up, Clan Donnal! Trusty and faithful we ever have known you;— Fearless and true were your fathers before you;— Long may their pride and their glory remain! Up, Clan Donnal! On through the torrent, and on through the river, And on up the steep where the mountain-sides shiver, For spirits of heroes are hovering o'er you, And yonder the Saxon invader before you;— On, from your soil with your good claymores sweep them, And high at the foot of your Grampians heap them. So up, and away! WELSH. [I. Of Hoel, high and glorious, raise the pæan The air in this instance is in quadruple time (4–4). The first of the songs accompanying it is written with a syllable to each note of the music. The second is written in the regular metrical rhythm of the air, with only one syllable to each eighth of time, but with a repeat of the first four lines. By reading in the second line of the first piece, “like meteor, streaming wide,”—in the fifth line, “the deeds of days departed,”—and in the eleventh line, “No more shall arm of hero,”—the rhythm of the verse becomes that of declamation.] Air: “Blodau yr Gogledd.”—(The Flower of the North.) I. The Song of Heroes. Of Hoel, high and glorious, raise the pæan, Bards, with hoary hair, like streaming meteor! Strike the harp, in martial symphony! Close the strain in sadness! The deeds of other days, worthy heroes, Bright as holy Heaven, fair as vernal flowers, Strong as mountain wolves, lions too in fight, Mild as April showers, in their peaceful days, Ruling righteously, conquering nobly,— Such, alas! are seen no more. No more shall hero's arm wield the falchion High-born Hoel bore to victory. Rust has dimmed it; time has tarnished it:— Breathe us tones of sorrow! II. Aloft resounds Llewellyn's horn; Sharp rings its blast, like note of scorn; From Snowdon's peaks it rolls at morn, O'er Gwynedd proudly swelling. Its echoes bound from crag and scar, And, borne by mountain winds afar, They call the Cambrian youth to war,— The Saxon's death-peal knelling. Like lightning's flash on lake or stream, The sword of Rhydderch darts its gleam. None, but its own unconquered lord, Can bear in fight that magic sword. Who else dares draw it from its sheath, Finds in its wasting flame his death. In Rhydderch's strong right-hand, it waves, A meteor, o'er yon Saxon slaves. Such Rhydderch's sword, Llewellyn's horn, Far-flashing, proudly swelling. II. The Bard's Song. Air: “Y Bardd yn ei Awen.”—(The Bard in his Inspiration.) Hark! yonder swells a music, Full, yet distant; as from Heaven, Flows it through the air. Bards! wake ye, and in chorus Tune your harps, and raise your voices,— Welcome here the song! Hail, heroes, bards and sages, Princely Hoel, high Cadwallon! Night veils us, but around us Heaven is opened, and its music Lifts us to its halls! III. The Song of Victory. Air: “Tôn Alarch.”—(The Swan's Note.) Shout, shout for victory! Raise high the pæan! Strong arms have conquered,— Strong hearts impelled them. Bright hymns shall welcome us, Loved arms embrace us, Fond blessings follow us Home to our halls. Full is our triumph; Home now is rescued: Sun-bright our victory; Stain cannot dim it. But for the fallen Breathe now the requiem! Glad songs should bear them High to their heaven. Shout, shout for victory! Low lies the invader: Heaven still protects us, Shields hearth and altar. Bards, tune your symphonies! Swell full your chorus! Bright deeds to other days Flow on your songs. Loud rings the pæan,— Youth fondly listens; Hearts so inspirited Pant high for glory. Soft tones of sorrow Breathe for the fallen,— Welcome as incense, Rise to the stars. IV. The Rising of the Lark. See! Morning breaks, And pours its light O'er yonder height, And, dewy bright, Young Day awakes. I mount and sing, On quivering wing, And bear to heaven My joyous song. In midway air, As flitting star, 'Mid golden beams I float along; While far below In dawn's first glow, The woods attune Their vocal throng. Thus lost in light, With sudden fall, From Heaven's high hall, At love's sweet call, I drop my flight; Then mount again. The eye in vain Can trace me, As I sweep on high; But still the ear Can ever hear My clear notes Falling from the sky, As if in bush, At evening's hush, The nightingale Close warbled by. Sing, joyous lark! My heart with thee Mounts light and free, High liberty Its shining mark. Still heavenward fly! With thee, on high, My spirit speeds From earth afar;— On airy wings, Aloft it springs, To dwell 'mid light Of sun and star;— Full-voiced and strong, It pours its song, Like hymn that greets The victor's car. THE NORNS. [The three Norns (Nornir) were the three Fates or Destinies of the Scandinavian Mythology. They were really only personifications of the three periods of time: the Past (Urd), the Present (Verandi), and the Future (Skuld).] Urd. Far in the depths of ages gone I dwell,— Around me forms of earliest splendor rise; Temple and heaven-like dome, with graceful swell, Blend, in their brightness, with the orient skies. On pyramid and column, glorious, shine High myths of heroes, carved in mystic line; Mysterious light o'er all, from Heaven, is thrown: And songs of glory fill the vocal air, Aloft the deeds of fame sublimely bear; Deep as the thunder, but how sweet, their tone! Verandi. On the rushing stream I sweep along; Sun-bright o'er me swells the cloudless blue; Joys around, a gay, triumphant throng, Lead me on, with high and cheerful song, Give me ever greetings, bright and new. Onward still the stream, in golden glow, Heaves and tosses, as if life were there: Warm and kindling, breathes the inspiring air; Wakened by its touch, in bounding flow, Thought and feeling in the joyance share. Urd. Calm, on my high-piled trophies, I repose,— On polished bronze I grave the immortal lay. A stream, from unseen fountain, by me flows, And hurrying bears my scattered leaves away. That is the rushing stream that leads thee on: Catch from its wave the leaves that, in the sun, Quick flash, like ice-gems in the dawn's first light. These from the holy past to thee are borne: Look reverent back, nor, in thy joyance, scorn The gifts from me that make thy present bright. Verandi. In my heart a living spirit burns, Nerved to earnest act and daring deed. Never, as it hastens, back it turns; All the past holds buried in its urns Win it not to check its onward speed. Who would give this glorious world around, Sun-bright stream, and fair and flowery shore, Hopes, like visions, leading on before, On, in light, to time's remotest bound,— Give, for all the great thou hast in store! Urd. Then speed thee reckless on,—but I remain, Where ancient glories still unfading tower: Deeds such as mine shall ne'er be done again,— The fruits of godlike thought and Titan power. Where, in the mystic light of orient skies, Vast pyramid and massive temple rise, In shade of sacred laurel I recline. The golden sun of morning meets me there; The first-born world, around me, fresh and fair,— Its life, its love, its music, all divine! Verandi. On the rushing stream, away! away! While the moments win us, speed along! As the favoring winds around us play, We have, too, a heart-inspiring lay; Only joy and hope awake our song. Or should tempest meet me on my path, Fearlessly my track I still pursue; Strength and skill is mine, to bear me through; Soon the wasting storm shall spend its wrath,— Joyous day again its light renew. Skuld. Far on the boundless deep I hold my throne, Where clouds and darkness rear their wondrous wall: Deep in their solemn shades I dwell alone; No stranger's foot has ever touched my hall. The stream of time still rushes to the main; Its golden waves attract the eye in vain: Amid the clouds that round me rise afar, One faint light draws it, like a magic star. That light is from my shrine;—in fuller glow It burns, than all your brightest years have known: Still burns it on, in one eternal flow, When past and present fame is ever gone. Speed on, then, o'er the deep! though, dim and dark, High heave the clouds, be that your beacon mark! Through the dun shades ye pass; then holiest day Sweeps, in illimitable bliss, away! END OF “THE DREAM OF A DAY,” ETC. POSTHUMOUS POEMS. INVOCATION. 1844. Once thou wast ever nigh me: now so long We have been parted, that I seek thee far, And find thee not. Once ever to my song Thou hastedst; in thy flight, as lambent star Shot from the highest sphere: And with thee, to my ear Came heartening tones, that kindly drew me on, Until, as self-evolved, my lay was done. Yet I would win thee still To dwell beside me, as in earlier days. That time of flowers is gone; its memory stays, And often will its dreams my spirit fill With youth's full joy. Where shall I seek thee now? Is it upon the sky-crowned mountain's brow? Or sit'st thou rather by the sounding shore,— Fit music for thee in its rush and roar,— Or roamest free the desert's boundless plain? O, lead me even so far, to find thee once again! A storm rose 'mid the gloom of yesternight; And as it just o'ertopped the distant hill, Forked lightnings played in jets of starry light, And yet the hushed and slumbrous air was still: But as the cloud rolled, billowy, up the sky, The flash soon heralded the bursting peal; 'Mid the wild conflict, then I felt me high Uplifted to thee, for I well could feel, Thou with the winds and thunders hadst thy flight. To-day the sky is clear; serenely blue It swells above me, and a freshening gale Tosses the sparkling sea, full in my view, Crested with many a bright and bellying sail. Thou too art hovering, in the sunny air, Over this fair spring-time of budding groves: Thou listen'st to the voice of happy loves; Smilest,—and answering smiles await thee there. But I would rather seek thee, where alone Thou find'st thy home, in the Ideal;—there Thou sittest, as a conqueror on his throne; Around thee stand the great, the good, the fair, Perfect as highest thought,—no dim decay Can ever waste them,—free from spot or stain, They live, unchanged, one long, eternal day;— Thither I haste, for there I cannot seek in vain. In that high home, O, pour thy sacred light Around my soul, that I may feel and know How godlike man, when, on his utmost height, He looks, as Washington, on all below, Mild, yet unbending; stern to keep the right, Yet filled with love of country's warmest glow, And holier love of all! Inspired by thee, O, be my theme alone the perfect and the free! THE STARLET. FROM THE DANISH OF STAFFELDT. There stood a star in the heaven's blue, And it sparkled so sweetly bright, A milder glance I never knew, And it filled me with delight. Methought all beauty and loveliness met In its softly-twinkling beam; I watched the bright star till I saw it set, In a still and happy dream. Each night 'mid the dew of the flowers I lay, And intently gazed on the star, Till the misty veil of the morning gray Hung over the hills afar. But since I have met thee, charmer dear, The star has no longer my love; I seek not the bliss that invites me here, In the blue of the heaven above. NATURE'S LYRE. “Is there no hand to wake my ancient lyre?” So, through the solemn hush of midnight, came Late to my soul a tone, that seemed, like fire, Within my heart to light its early flame. Far from on high it flowed, and to my ear Bore through the dark profound the song of holiest sphere. “Is there no hand to tune my harp again, As once it rung on Zion's sacred hills, Whence borne by airs from heaven o'er vale and plain, The desert smiled, the sea was smooth and still? Is there no voice to swell that lofty lay Up to the golden gates of never-ending day? “Will none awake again the heroic string, Such as Olympus heard 'mid sky-crowned snows? The bounding accents leap; responsive ring Struck swords on brazen shield that burnished glows. Will no proud youth take up the epic song, And 'mid triumphal halls its wondrous charm prolong? “Is there no lip can fill the pastoral flute, And pour its sweetness on the vernal air; To the blest time of loves and blossoms suit The strain that breathes alone the soft and fair? Is there no joyous heart to give once more The festal hymn, that rose by myrtle-tufted shore? “When shall the lyric trumpet, from its sleep Start to new life, as when of old it blew Summons to patriot souls, and stirred them deep, That to the joy of fight, like heroes, they flew, Whether on Ilium's glory-lighted coast, Or where the Baltic rolls 'mid Valhall's realms of frost? “And who is there can lead the fairy dance, To ever-changeful notes, from citherns borne Through the wild, tangled shadows of Romance, Oft startled by the clang of elfin horn? Is there a voice can render, full and free, That song of tenderest love, and gayest revelry? “And dare one touch the lyre of many tones, That spake the all-meaning language of a world, So clear and true, the song each passion owns,— Hope's swelling lip, and pride's in anger curled? Will none that fullest harmony display, And lead it with strong hand careering on its way? “Have ye, then, all forgot my ancient lyre, To Nature's pure and simple music strung? Have poor conceits subdued its native fire, And a false art cold fetters round it flung? True art is perfect nature:—wake and give New motion to its chords, and know, thy song shall live!” MASONIC SONGS. I. MASTER'S SONG. BY A BROTHER. In harmony the social band Are met around the fount of light, To spend beneath the Master's hand, In decent joy, the festive night; Let each, in truth and honor bright, Be present at the secret hall, And on his heart in silence write The sacred word that binds us all. Beneath the blue and starry zone Whose arch, high-swelling, girds the pole, The Master, on his orient throne, Unfolds to view the mystic roll; At once the pure, fraternal soul Bends to the sign, with sacred awe, And reads upon the lettered scroll, In words of light, the unuttered law. Let us our hearts and hands entwine, And form one perfect wreath of love; Then, kneeling at the voice divine That spake to mortals from above, Put on the meekness of the dove, And the white robes of charity, And, in unerring wisdom, prove Our brethren with the single eye. Be there no darkling scowl of hate Upon the calm, unruffled brow; But each, in innocence elate, To virtue's brightness only bow: Blest guardian of all pleasures! thou Be ever at our Master's side, And mark, with radiant finger, how Thy words can be our only guide. By thee conducted, we ascend The steps that lead above to Heaven; And where the mounting arches end, To each the sign of worth is given; Then, mantled by the shades of even, We meet beneath the unclouded sky, And bind the links no power hath riven, In which we swear to live and die. Let us these favored hours employ, These moments of the social night, To sing the silver song of joy, And make the chain of union bright; So may we ever here unite To spend the hours in mercy given, Led by the tokens which invite Alone to happiness and Heaven. II. ROYAL ARCH SONG. BY A COMPANION. Joy! the sacred law is found, Now the temple stands complete; Gladly let us gather round Where the Pontiff holds his seat. Now he spreads the volume wide, Opening forth its leaves to-day,— And the Monarch by his side Gazes on the bright display. Joy! the secret vault is found; Full the sunbeam falls within, Pointing, darkly underground, To the treasure we would win: They have brought it forth to light, And again it cheers the earth; All its leaves are purely bright, Shining in their newest worth. This shall be the sacred mark Which shall guide us to the skies, Bearing, like a holy ark, All the hearts who love to rise; This shall be the corner-stone, Which the builders threw away, But was found the only one Fitted for the arch's stay. This shall be the gavel true, At whose sound the crowd shall bend, Giving to the law its due; This shall be the faithful friend; This the token which shall bring Kindness to the sick and poor, Hastening on an angel's wing To the lone and darksome door. This shall crown the mighty arch, When the temple springs on high, And the brethren bend their march, Wafting incense to the sky; Then the solemn strain shall swell From the bosom and the tongue, And the Master's glory tell In the harmony of song. Here the exile, o'er the waste Trudging homeward, shall repose; All his toils and dangers past, Here his long sojourning close; Entering through the sacred veils, To the holy arch he bends; Then, as sinking nature fails, Hope in glad fruition ends. III. SELECT MASTER'S SONG. BY A COMPANION. The vault arches o'er us, and night broods around; Not a whisper is heard through the depth of the cave; All hearts, in the silence of secrecy bound, Are reading the words the Great Architect gave: United they listen the voice of the law, The guide to our reason, the spur of the soul, And they feel in the sounds a sweet mystery draw Their hearts to the Spirit who uttered the whole. Now the work is completed, and all are combined, To close in the secret and deep-hidden cell The words which are treasured as light to the mind, Like the waters of truth in their close-covered well; Here safely secured, they shall live in the rock, When the storm rages o'er it and levels the wall, And still, in the rage of the conqueror's shock, The arches shall neither be shaken nor fall. We have laid in its secret and silent retreat The treasure that kings shall exult to behold; And the pilgrim shall hasten with ardor to meet This gift, valued higher than jewels or gold: Ages roll on their way, and no foot shall be heard In search of this scroll to enlighten the world; But a hand shall be found to recover the word, And then shall the standard of truth be unfurled. We are seated in silence, and nothing can find Its way to our distant and mystical cave; And the watchman who guards not, our mandate shall bind In the deeper concealment of death and the grave: Be faithful and true, ever firm to your trust, Is the lesson we give in the council of light, And the herald shall summon you forth from the dust, Above in the meeting of souls to unite. SONG. SEPTEMBER, 1852. [Written for the dedication of a monument in Milford, Connecticut, over the graves of a number of American soldiers, who died of fever contracted while prisoners in New York.] Honor, for ever honor due Be paid the patriot brave,— The men, to home and country true, Who died our rights to save. They planted on this fertile soil, And wet with blood, the tree; Ours is the fruit of all their toil, They bled—and we are free. They bound the chain of union strong, And bade it ever hold; That we, their sons, may gather long Within its happy fold. That chain of union let us keep Bright as when first it shone; The love they cherished fixed and deep, That love be all our own. Let years roll on, and far and wide Still spread our free domain, The dead who rest here side by side Will not have died in vain. MIDNIGHT MUSIC. [The following is an imitation of Goethe's Night Song (Nachtgesang), in measure, number of stanzas, and order of repetition, but not in language. I give it as a specimen of versification, rather than of poetry.] What sound of midnight music Comes stealing on my ear? How sweet, and oh! how holy, The solemn strain I hear! How sweet, and oh! how holy, It echoes far and near, As if an angel warbled The solemn strain I hear. As if an angel warbled From out the highest sphere: Sure mortal could not utter The solemn strain I hear. Sure mortal could not utter A song so soft and clear: O, might it ever linger, The solemn strain I hear! O, might it ever linger, Thus breathing in my ear, That sound of midnight music, The solemn strain I hear! JUVENILE POEMS. The following pieces were printed in the author's first volume, which appeared in 1821. The motto on the title-page of the original book was this verse from Southey: “Go, little book, from this my solitude: I cast thee on the waters,—go thy ways, And if, as I believe, thy vein be good, The world may find thee after certain days.” AN ODE TO MELANCHOLY. “The joy of grief.”— Ossian. Melancholy! blue-eyed maid, Clad in simple russet stole, Thou who lov'st the silent shade, And weep'st where murmuring rivulets roll, Calmer of the troubled breast, Heaving wild with passion's throe, Thou who lay'st the heart at rest, And cool'st distraction's fevered glow! When thou leanest o'er the rill, And minglest with its wave thy tear, O, what sounds the woodland fill, And softly whisper in my ear! Come then, enchanting Melancholy, Thou sweetest mistress of my heart! Come, let us leave the haunts of folly, And taste the joys that ne'er depart. Melancholy! maid of Heaven! Thine are pleasures known by few,— Joys to favorites only given,— Joys that soothe like summer dew; Thine the harp, whose golden wire Bids Heaven's sweetest music roll, Kindling with a seraph's fire, And calmly stealing to the soul. When thou pour'st the dying strain, Naiads smile along the wave, Shepherds listen on the plain, And hermits in the mountain cave. Come then, &amp;c. Melancholy! Pity's child! Turn on me thine eye of blue, Soft as when affection smiled, Or wept compassion's purest dew; Wake thy voice that charms the grove, Breathe thy calmest, sweetest lay,— Strike thy silver chord of love, And drive the cruel fiend away; For thou sooth'st the tortured heart To a holy, heavenly calm, And gently heal'st affliction's smart With thy music's softening balm. Come then, &amp;c. Angel of the green-wood shade! Let me lie on moss reclined, When the hues of evening fade, And calmly blows the fragrant wind,— Let me lie beside thy rill, And view the stream that ripples by, Till my soul shall drink its fill Of thy delightful melody. O, how soft, how sweet, how mild, All the sounds that kiss thy string! How they echo from the wild, And in the flowery valleys ring! Come then, &amp;c. Melancholy! dearest maid, Bending low thine eyes of blue! Roam the gently opening glade, And thickets gemmed with morning dew; Seek the cool, sequestered cave, When the noon is glowing bright; Rest where forests slowly wave, And floats a faintly trembling light. Where'er thou rov'st at early dawn, Or sit'st, when glows the noontide sky, Dearer at night the quiet lawn And winding rill that ripples by. Come then, enchanting Melancholy, Thou sweetest mistress of my heart; Come, let us leave the haunts of folly, And taste the joys that ne'er depart. FRAGMENT OF AN ODE TO FANCY. Let us in the early dawn, Seek the mountain's awful brow, When the shades of night are gone, And calmly smiles the scene below;— Let us wander carelessly Through the silence-breathing wood, And gaze where swiftly rushes by, Whitened with foam, the troubled flood;— Let us steal along the vale, Where the bee is humming round, And the velvet-pinioned gale Whispers o'er the flowery ground. Nymph of most enchanting power, Let us roam the wild-wood through, When at morn or evening's hour Droop the leaves with pearly dew. NAPOLEON. His glance was fixed on power alone, His breast was steeled to woe; He cared not for the dying groan, His tears could never flow: Hard as the rock, his flinty soul Sported with life and blood; Impatient of the least control, Above the world, he stood. O'er Europe's plains he marched to slay; He spoke—and empires fell; Destruction's gory path his way; His voice—a nation's knell: Kings bent their necks beneath his rod, And owned his iron sway; On crowns and thrones he proudly trod, Or threw the toys away. “Be free,” the lying despot said,— “Be free,”—and they were slaves; Before him every virtue fled,— He dug their dreary graves: Madly he hoped to be obeyed By realms in ruin hurled, And 'neath his banner's awful shade To gather in the world. ODE ON DEATH. Toll for the brave! He whom we saw afar, First in the ranks of war, Sleeps in the grave; No flags or pennons o'er the hero wave; Ne'er shall the cannon's roar, the trumpet's breath The drum's loud tumult, wake the sleep of death, No shout of triumph animate the brave; No burnished eagle glitters o'er his head,— High from his tomb the bird has ta'en her flight, While sable yews o'ershadow Honor's bed, And coldly fall the chilling dews of night, Steeping the wintry turf that hides the mighty dead. Toll for the just! That eye of tempered fire, Which shunned each wrong desire, Fades in the dust; Hushed is that eloquence so nobly bold; The heart that felt for suffering is cold; Affliction mourns above his honored bust,— Her tears, slow-stealing o'er its marble cheek, Tell of his soul of majesty and love, His eye, that ever glanced on things above, At once in justice firm, in kind compassion meek: Goodness must fade;—the equal hand of death Quenches the villain's and the just man's breath. Toll for the fair! Go, seek the lonely tomb, Go, wander through its gloom, She slumbers there: Her angel look, that melted every soul, Her eye, that rolled its glance of tenderness, Her form encircled round with every grace, Now moulder 'neath corruption's sable stole; The worm is cradled on her forehead fair, And wantons 'mid the ringlets of her hair,— Each tint of faded beauty charms no more; The fragrance of her lip, its living rose, No more in Heaven's own purest crimson glows,— 'Tis livid as the stream that laves th' Avernian shore. A fleeting day The cheek of beauty glows, The voice of music flows, Then melts away; Fluttering amid the summer's transient ray, The gaudy fop expands his shining wing; In bounding step the merry dancers spring, Like insects sportive, like the rainbow gay: Soon o'er this smiling scene the wintry storm Of dark affliction sheds its lurid gloom, Wafting upon its blast Destruction's form, Who calls, with voice of thunder, to the tomb; Like lightning flashing o'er the sleeper's head, He wakes them from their dream, then hides them with the dead. We all must die! Each form, that proudly soars Where war's confusion roars, Must lowly lie; The bard must hush his voice, and close his eye; His clay-cold hand must rest upon his lyre, No more to wake its hallowed soul of fire, No more to swell the heart or steal the sigh: Low in the humid dust, the noisome grave, We rest our wearied limbs, we end our toils; There fade the short-lived laurels of the brave, There melt away the statesman's causeless broils, There wastes the corpse to dust,—'t is all we know Of man, the tenant of a world of woe. How dark the tomb! Doubt shades that dreary cave, And curtains round the grave With formless gloom. O, what a spectre issues from its womb! How dark his swarthy eye, its lurid glare Like flames that in the dreary midnight flare! With what a hollow voice he speaks our doom! Impervious darkness on its raven wing Hangs o'er the bed of death; the sceptic eye Sees no fair realm beyond this being lie, While wan despair and ghastly terror fling Their horrors o'er the couch, where helpless mortals die. Is there a ray Whose brightness can illume The grave, and bid the gloom Disperse away? Is there a twinkling star amid this storm, Where all is cold and cheerless, all despair? Reveals it to the sight an angel form, Whose pinions, floating on the murky air, Scatter the tempest-clouds, and o'er the sky Unveil a morning tint of rosy hue, And clothe the noontide vault with lovely blue, While through the vale light airs and balmy zephyrs fly? There is a form, Whose brightly beaming eye Disperses from the sky Life's gloomy storm: Around her brow celestial radiance plays, Her candid vestments shine with dazzling light, A thousand twinkling gems, like stars of night, In virtue's ægis, on her bosom blaze; She speaks,—and tones of heavenly harmony Flow through the air and tremble on the gale; The mourner raises her desponding eye, And the heart-broken maid remits her wail;— 'T is Hope, who, bending from her native skies, Bids through Death's dreary vale delicious beauties rise. ODE TO RELIGION. Daughter of Heaven! whose tender eye Bends from thy throne of light above, And in the wounds of misery Distils the healing tears of love; Clad in the spotless robes of day, Thou clear'st the moral night away, And at thy touch dispersive roll The dark, impervious clouds, that shroud the guilty soul. Along the vale of death and pain, In sable weeds, a band appears; Around them fly a horrent train Of sharp regrets and boding fears; O'er flinty paths their way they wind, And leave their track in blood behind; Remembrance has no light to cheer, And dim, through lowering clouds, the beams of hope appear. They backward look on early flowers, On buds of bliss and dews of joy: How few, how fleeting, were those hours! They flattered only to destroy: Amid the woven blossoms rose The gloomy forms of real woes, And Disappointment backward threw, With cold, repulsive hand, the eager-hastening crew. With bounding heart and burning soul With look elate, and eye of fire, Youth hurried from the lifted goal, Impelled by glory, love, desire: Before him shone the dazzling prize,— Hope flashed exulting from his eyes; He stretched his hand,—Despair, with thrilling scream, Repelled his grasp, and broke his gilded dream. Celestial maid! thy mellow light Can pierce the clouds that round us lower, And pour upon the drooping sight From Heaven the soul-enkindling shower; And as the soft-distilling rain Enlivens all the thirsty plain, Thy drops of love awake the heart, And heal the festering wounds of sorrow's venomed dart. O come! and on me kindly lay The mantle of thy loveliness, And all my errors wash away In the pure fountain of thy grace; And when I weep o'er joys gone by, And view the past with wishful eye, Be thine to lift my sinking soul, And guide my wearied steps to Heaven's eternal goal. STAR OF BETHLEHEM. Brighter than the rising day, When the sun in glory shines, Brighter than the diamond's ray Sparkling in Golconda's mines, Beaming through the clouds of woe, Smiles in Mercy's diadem Brighter on the world below, The Star that rose in Bethlehem. When our eyes are dimmed with tears, This can light them up again, Sweet as music to our ears Faintly warbling o'er the plain. Never shines a ray so bright From the purest earthly gem; O, there is no soothing light Like the Star of Bethlehem! Grief's dark clouds may round us roll, Every heart may sink in woe, Gloomy conscience rack the soul, And sorrow's tears in torrents flow; Still through all these clouds and storms Shines this purest heavenly gem, With a ray that kindly warms,— The Star that rose in Bethlehem. When we cross the roaring wave That rolls on life's remotest shore, When we look into the grave And wander through this world no more, This the lamp, whose genial ray, Like some brightly glowing gem, Points to man his darkling way,— The Star that rose in Bethlehem. Let the world be sunk in sorrow, Not an eye be charmed or blest; We can see a fair to-morrow Shining in the rosy west; For this beacon Hope displays, For in Mercy's diadem Shines with Faith's serenest rays The Star that rose in Bethlehem. When this gloomy life is o'er, When we smile in bliss above, When on that delightful shore We enjoy the heaven of love; O, what dazzling light shall shine Round salvation's purest gem! O, what rays of love divine Gild the Star of Bethlehem! TRUMPET OF LIBERTY. Trumpet of Liberty! Trumpet of Freedom! Call on thy sons, And to victory lead them: Youth whose bright tresses wave, Age with locks hoary, All who are good and brave, Summon to glory. Trumpet of Liberty! Rend thou asunder Slavery's chains With a war-note of thunder. Slaves, from your slumbers start, Wake ye from slavery! O, let the warrior's heart Kindle in bravery! Trumpet of Liberty! Europe shall hear thee. Blow Freedom's blast, Every tyrant shall fear thee. Call on the brave, And to victory lead them,— Tyrants to death, And the slave to his freedom. Nations arise! In the might of your bravery; Banish your kings,— Live no longer in slavery; Rise in your strength,— They shall tremble and fear you; Call for your rights,— Every tyrant shall hear you. Nations, be free! 'T is your good and your glory; Then shall your deeds Live and brighten in story. Trumpet of Liberty! On to fame lead them. O, they shall conquer, For sacred is freedom! ODE ON THE EMANCIPATION OF SPAIN. From her slumber the Genius of Freedom is waking, Where her flag through long ages of darkness lay furled; From slavery's cloud all her bright beams are breaking, Like the sun from a tempest that saddened the world. At her touch, see her banner exultingly wave; At her call, see the Spaniard to liberty springing, Hear each voice the wild hymn of deliverance singing, While the funeral knell of the tyrant is ringing, That calls him to death and the gloom of the grave. O'er those hills rich with vines, o'er those plains gay with roses, Where Bigotry glared like a meteor of night, Now the sunbeam of Liberty sweetly reposes, And gently re-echoes the song of delight; The fetters that clanked round the form of the slave Melt away like the transient dew of the morning; While bright as yon rainbow, the blue heavens adorning, Of his doom of destruction base Tyranny warning, Shines Freedom's starred wreath on the brow of the brave. O, long have ye slept in the dungeon of woe, And mourned o'er your fetters through lingering years, Where the dirges of sorrow unceasingly flow, And the eye of the mourner is melted in tears! No sound but the death-knell was poured in your ear, No sight, but Despair in his agony starting, Distraction his glance like the thunderbolt darting, The wretch 'neath the red scourge of Bigotry smarting, The wild glare of madness, the shivering of fear. But the lightning of Freedom has roused every soul From the chill, icy slumber, the sleep of the grave; With radiant fingers she points to the goal, Where glitters the crown that encircles the brave: Then burst into life like the beast from his lair, When he stalks through the desert with hunger wild roaring, Rush on like the flood through the mountain glen pouring, Rise, rise like the hawk on his pinions high-soaring, And show to the tyrant what freemen can dare. [Day-star of Liberty! dawn on our sky] Day-star of Liberty! dawn on our sky; Day-star of Liberty! kindle thy light; Dawn on the plains where the Polanders lie Slumbering in slavery, buried in night. Day-star of Liberty! bright are thy rays; Day-star of Liberty! clear is thy beam: Dawn on our hills with thy ruddiest blaze, Shine through the forest and brighten the stream. Wake from his slumber the high-hearted Pole, Point him to freedom, and summon him on; Spirit him up in his vengeance to roll Backward the Russ and the Cossack of Don. Shine on the tombs where our heroes are laid,— Heroes, who died for their country, and hurled Solyman's legions in crowds to the dead,— Heroes, who rescued from Mahmoud the world. Hark! Sobieski has called from his tomb: “Think of our glory,—no longer be slaves; Summon the merciless Russ to their doom,— O let the fields they have robbed be their graves!” Poles, will you sleep when your demigod calls? Poles, will you bend to the yoke of the Czar? Think of Suwarrow,—of Prague's mouldering walls; Raise freedom's flag, sound the trumpet of war. Vengeance! to arms! Sobieski! the word; Vengeance! to arms! on, ye Polanders, on! Hurl from your plains, with the might of your sword, Backward the Russ and the Cossack of Don. ODE ON THE EMANCIPATION OF SOUTH AMERICA. Star of the Southern pole, That from the Atlantic deep Rose, and on Andes' steep Shone with a beacon-light, And woke from moral night The Spaniard's haughty soul! They started from their sleep, and tore The chains that bound them to their tyrant's throne: Uncheered, unaided, they alone Their banner reared on Plata's shore, And in the dawning light of Liberty Swore they would live and die united, firm, and free. Where, rising o'er the silver tide, That rolls its host of waters wide, Resistless as a sea, Fair shine their city's happy walls, Convened within the sacred halls Of infant Liberty, They banded round their flag, and gave Redemption to the fettered slave, And o'er those plains like ocean spread, And o'er their mountains' icy head, And o'er their full, majestic river, And through their halls, their fanes, their towers, They lit a flame, shall burn for ever; Nor Tyranny with all her powers, Though battled in her holy league, shall dare The statue they have reared from its high column tear. Sister in freedom! o'er the main We send our hearts to thee; O, ne'er may kings and priests again Stain with their steps thy flowery plain, Nor vex the brave and free. When earth beside was wrapped in night, Here Freedom lit her quenchless light, And hence its rays shall always beam, And Europe yet shall hear the voice, And wake from her inglorious dream, And in her new-found strength rejoice. In one fraternal band, let all The nations, who would spurn the chains That tyrants forge, would burst their thrall, And wash away their servile stains, And, proud of independent worth, In honest dignity go forth,— Let all who will not bow the knee, Nor humbly kiss the trampling heel, Who swear to perish or be free, Unite, and draw their flashing steel, And proud and daring in their second birth Purge from its crowns and thrones the renovated earth. ODE ON THE EMANCIPATION OF GREECE. ????? ?????? ??? ???????.— Greek War Song. O'er Greece a dawn is rising; The clouds that shroud her break away: Again, behold! the immortal day, When Persia's hosts chastising, In Marathon's unequal fight, The demigods of old arose, And, mantled in the patriot's might, Drove back in shame their myriad foes, And crowned their brows with civic wreaths of light. That day shall never perish! The grass grows green above their graves; But Liberty will cherish The turf for ages trod by slaves. She sounds her trumpet: “Greeks, arise! Be men once more! O, let the hallowed stream That flows to you from Lacedæmon, glow With new-waked ardor; let the beam Of independence purge your eyes, And, waking from your long, long dream Of prostrate thraldom, front the skies, And bear, with onward breast, against your tyrant foe.” She stands on mangled Parthenon, And in her raised, commanding hand She waves aloft her thirsty brand, And points to fields your hardy parents won, When not a foe dared touch their land, Who fled not, clothed with blood and shame: O, what a pure, unmingled flame Of high, enduring, jealous freedom shone In hearts of stern, but fine-wrought mould,— Hearts that spurned at power and gold, And scorned the proudest monarch on his throne! Though few, they shrunk not when the prowlers came In countless swarms, like locusts, to devour Their harvests and destroy their name, And o'er their much-loved country shower Blood and havoc, tears and flame: Yes, in that dark and awful hour, When Xerxes, with his ravening host, Hung, threatening vengeance, on their coast, No eye was dim, no cheek was pale; Their blood was up, their hearts were glowing, And, like a storm-fed torrent flowing With foam and fury through the echoing vale, From their rude battlements of rocks they rushed, And with their giant tread the awe-struck Persian crushed. Greeks! arise, be free! Arm for liberty! Men of Sparta! hear the call, Who could never bear the thrall Of coward Frank or savage Turk! From those mountains where you lurk, Send the voice of Freedom forth, Spread it through the fettered North, And from Morea tear her funeral pall. Now the nations are waking From slavery's night; Their manacles breaking, They haste to the fight, Where tyrants shall make their last stand for their thrones: O, by your stripes, your tears, your groans, Now gird your loins with vengeance! let the fire Of high achievement heart and soul inspire; Be nerved to die or conquer, fixed to fall, Like Sparta's sacred band before the wall, Which stood a bulwark to the invading swarm! O, be your hearts thus bold, thus warm, Devoted to your country's cause! Be there no stay, no rest, no pause! Once more the sun of Liberty shall pour Its brightest glories on the Ægean shore. SONNET TO ITALY. I acknowledge I have not given the fine image expressed in the seventh and eighth lines of the original. I have given them another turn. I refer to those struggles in which Italy has been the prize of contending nations. Since the downfall of the Roman Empire, she has never made an energetic resistance to her invaders. Her bloodiest wars have been those in which she has torn her own vitals, or in which other nations have fought together for her possession. In these conflicts she has stood like Virgil's heifer, and she has truly found the passion of her lovers selfish and inhuman. The work is not yet ended, and never will be, till the spirit of Brutus shall awake and enkindle her now degraded population. FROM THE ITALIAN OF VINCENZO DA FILICAIA. Italia! O Italia! whom the hand Of Heaven arrayed in beauty,—fatal dower, For which unnumbered wrongs afflict thy land And on thy furrowed brow the wasting power Has stamped his burning characters of shame; Less sweet and fair, but more robust and brave, Thou hadst not been of lords the lovely slave, Who seek thee with an all-devouring flame, Pouring their blood in strife, and wasting thine. O, wert thou braver and less fair, no more Should I behold the armed torrents roar Down those tall Alps, where snows eternal shine; Nor see again those tireless hounds of war, The French, their limbs with battle heated, lave In Po or Lodi's gore-impurpled wave; Nor see thee, chained to some proud nation's car, And girt with foreign armor, idly brave, Beneath the Gaul or Gothic despot's star, For ever, conqueror or conquered, slave. AN ODE SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN SUNG AT NIAGARA FALLS, ON AN ANNIVERSARY OF OUR INDEPENDENCE. O'er the blue, swelling sky, with a heavenly ray, The sun shines serene on this glorious day; And the flag of Columbia waves o'er the steep, Where Niagara pours all its floods in the deep. Let the roar of the cannon, the blast of the horn, Usher in with their wild notes this glorious morn: Let the toast of warm hearts be drank round to the brave, Who defended our flag on Ontario's wave. Let England exult in the fire of her tars: We can boast braver souls 'neath the blaze of our stars,— Hearts that glow when the cannon, resounding afar, Gives the signal of battle, the larum of war. On the billow of ocean to glory they sail, While the stars proudly float on the wild-blowing gale; And a halo encircles the brow of the brave, When to triumph they march on Ontario's wave. Let the cannon resound, let the trumpet be blown; For the demon of War o'er the ocean has flown, And Peace with her olive-leaf honors the brave, Who fought for their homes on Ontario's wave. Let the banner of blood on the wind be unfurled, And the tempest of discord o'ershadow the world; Let Peace, with her angel of Mercy, be fled, And Murder exult in the groans of the dead: When the trumpet and drum give the signal of war, The Spirit of Freedom shall kindle her star,— Shall clothe with her mantle of glory the brave, Or rock them to rest on Ontario's wave. They shall march to her foes by her beacon's red light, And conquer or die in the glorious fight; And Honor shall dig for the sailor a grave, Or light him to fame, on Ontario's wave. Then exult in the day when our nation was born: Raise the shout of delight,—wind the blast of the horn,— Peal the roll of the drum,—let the cannon's loud roar Resound with the torrent that lashes the shore. Should Britain insult us, our eagle shall fly, Encircled with stars, on our flag through the sky; From the mouth of the cannon, the free and the brave Shall reply to our foes on Ontario's wave. THE DEATH OF LAWRENCE. Evening has closed o'er the wave of the ocean, Peace has returned to the sailor again, Hushed is the din of the battle's commotion, Nothing is heard but the roar of the main: Far as the eager eye through the dark shade can spy, Nothing is seen but the foam of the wave; While the loud tempests sweep wild o'er the heaving deep, Ploughing the breast of bold Lawrence's grave. What is that steals on my listening ear? O, 't is the accent of mourning and woe! Grief, for the loss of a leader so dear,— Grief, for the death of a generous foe. Now bleeds each sailor's heart,—wounded by sorrow's dart, Tears flow in torrents for Lawrence the bold; O, we shall ne'er, they cry, see his fire-flashing eye, When on his country's foes fiercely it rolled! O, what a sight, on that glorious morning, Glanced our bold ship o'er the billowy wave! Freedom and valor its banner adorning, Victory cheering the hearts of the brave. Glittered the sailor's eye, throbbed his rough bosom high, While the starred flag floated wide on the wind; Bright glowed the hero's soul,—proudly his glance did roll,— Fixed were his features, and nobly resigned. See, on the distant main swiftly advancing, Albion's sons spread their banner afar; Light on the crest of the foamy wave dancing, See, they unfurl the red ensign of war. Marked you the hero's eye,—bright as the noontide sky, Stern as the frown that the roused lion wears, When, like the whirlwind's rage, fiercely the foes engaged,— Mingling in battle, the cross and the stars. Loud swelled the cannon's roar o'er the wide ocean, Lashed by the prow, heaved the crimson-dyed foam; Wild was the din of the battle's commotion, While many a soul sought its long, latest home; Bright glared the fatal flame,—death-winged the bullet came, Full on our leader it darted its blow; Then each tar heaved a sigh,—tears gushed from every eye,— Lawrence is wounded, our hero is low. Mark, from his breast how his life-blood is streaming; Mark, how his eyeballs in agony roll; Still through that mist valor's spirit is beaming, Still his last words speak the fire of his soul: “Rear up the Eagle high! point it unto the sky,— There let it soar while the bloody fight raves, There let its wings outspread,—flap o'er the mighty dead, Till it shall plunge in the fathomless waves.” Long shall his spirit illumine our stars, Long as our flag on the tempest shall fly; Long as our Eagle the thunderbolt bears, It shall soar on its pinions and flash in its eye: When on the stormy main venture our ships again, Then shall his valor our bosoms inspire; When we the broadsides pour, and war's dread thunders roar, Lawrence shall lead like a pillar of fire. PERRY'S VICTORY ON LAKE ERIE. Bright was the morn,—the waveless bay Shone like a mirror to the sun; 'Mid greenwood shades and meadows gay, The matin birds their lays begun: While swelling o'er the gloomy wood Was heard the faintly-echoed roar,— The dashing of the foamy flood, That beat on Erie's distant shore. The tawny wanderer of the wild Paddled his painted birch canoe, And, where the wave serenely smiled, Swift as the darting falcon, flew; He rowed along that peaceful bay, And glanced its polished surface o'er, Listening the billow far away, That rolled on Erie's lonely shore. What sounds awake my slumbering ear? What echoes o'er the waters come? It is the morning gun I hear, The rolling of the distant drum. Far o'er the bright illumined wave I mark the flash,—I hear the roar, That calls from sleep the slumbering brave, To fight on Erie's lonely shore. See how the starry banner floats, And sparkles in the morning ray: While sweetly swell the fife's gay notes In echoes o'er the gleaming bay: Flash follows flash, as through yon fleet Columbia's cannons loudly roar, And valiant tars the battle greet, That storms on Erie's echoing shore. O, who can tell what deeds were done, When Britain's cross, on yonder wave, Sunk 'neath Columbia's dazzling sun, And met in Erie's flood its grave? Who tell the triumphs of that day, When, smiling at the cannon's roar, Our hero, 'mid the bloody fray, Conquered on Erie's echoing shore? Though many a wounded bosom bleeds For sire, for son, for lover dear, Yet Sorrow smiles amid her weeds,— Affliction dries her tender tear; Oh! she exclaims, with glowing pride, With ardent thoughts that wildly soar, My sire, my son, my lover died, Conquering on Erie's bloody shore! Long shall my country bless that day, When soared our Eagle to the skies; Long, long in triumph's bright array, That victory shall proudly rise: And when our country's lights are gone, And all its proudest days are o'er, How will her fading courage dawn, To think on Erie's bloody shore! [By the spirits of the dead] By the spirits of the dead, Who sunk to death in Erie's wave,— By the hearts that nobly bled,— By the free, unconquered brave,— We will draw the freeman's sword, When the Briton threats our shore; Mingle freedom's battle-word Proudly with the cannon's roar. We have faced, will face again, Death and slaughter;—shall we fly? Shall we leave the tented plain,— Leave it, when the foe is nigh? Come, invader! here we stand, On the border of the wave; Ere thou touch our native land, Thou shalt lay us in the grave. Here we stand, and here we die; Bring thy ships, thy rockets bring; Here our nation's flag shall fly, Here shall wave our Eagle's wing. Range in battle-line thy fleet,— Ravage—burn—destroy; but know, Though we perish, thou shalt meet— Meet in every form a foe. Sons of freedom! seize the gun, Level well the marksman's eye, Tell them how the deed is done, Tell how sure our bullets fly. Draw a sword, the brave may wield, Draw it, when the Britons come, “Hurry, hurry to the field,” With the fife and rolling drum. Point thy cannons on the foe, Bid their lightnings flash afar, Far and wide his thousands strow With thy thunder-bolts of war. Mingle boldly in the fray, Shrink not at the sight of blood, Think how, on his fatal day, Firm, undaunted, Lawrence stood. See! his spirit strides the wave, Calls you where he nobly fell,— Victory's summons to the brave, To the foe his funeral knell. By that soul of ardent flame, By that soul that could not yield, Hurry to the field of fame,— Hurry to the battle-field. ODE TO THE MEMORY OF PERRY. With brow serene a form advanced, His lofty eye was fixed on heaven, To him the strength of soul was given, A frown on vice he sternly glanced; His purpose firm, his bosom clear, He could not stoop, he could not fear; With giant step he trod the ground, The living waves rolled back, and gave An honorable space around; Such soul-subduing power attends the virtuous brave. Amid the deafening roar of War, Or mad Sedition's thundering shock, The senate's brawl, the forum's jar, He stands, an intellectual rock: In vain the storms of party rage Against his moveless form engage, In vain the torrent rushes by,— He views the chafing flood with firm, undaunted eye. At once he rose in dazzling light,— No deed of arms had graced his shield, Nor proudly bore its argent field The story of victorious fight: He burst, a sun, upon the world. He stood his country's brazen wall, Her bolt with conquering arm he hurled, And, springing at her sacred call, Through death and danger fearless rushed: His hand was nerved, his heart inspired, By valor's fire his soul was flushed; Nor stopped he till his foe retired, Their rage subdued, their thunders hushed;— Then in a youthful victor's might he trod, And owned no sovereign but his land and God. A nation's dawning light has fled: Beyond the ocean's purple wave, He coldly sleeps among the dead, Without a stone to deck his grave: Cut off in honor's early bloom, When life was young and spirits high, He sank in silence to the tomb, Forbid in valor's field to die. Pale sickness o'er him spread her gloom; And he who, in the mortal strife, Where nations toil for death or life, Had better winged his heavenward flight, Who should have slept on glory's bed, In sorrow quenched his new-dawned light, And feebly mingled with the dead. O, had he met on Erie's wave The glorious death he nobly sought, That death by matchless valor bought,— A hero generous as brave,— We then had borne him to his tomb With all the tenderness of grief, And wept with honest pride his doom, And hailed him as our darling chief. The sailor asks no sweeter grave Than ocean's gore-impurpled wave; His life is in his country's hand, And where she calls he loves to fly, In battle's shock unmoved to stand, In battle's carnage fearless die: He sees the light of fame aspire And kindle, as the dun clouds roll, Its quenchless pyramid of fire,— He sees, and hurries to the goal; And while the voice of conflict roars, His ardent spirit springs and soars; By glory's breath his soul is driven, He walks on earth, but lives in heaven; And, as the mounting arrow flew Along the lofty fields of blue, Ascending still, he onward flies, And dies in flame amid the skies. How few attain that envied height, Where all is cloudless, pure, and bright! How few the souls that never stoop, How few the hearts that never droop, Who always fix their eye on fame, Their only wealth their mighty name, Their only boast, to do the deed That all may love, but none decry,— In freedom's holy cause to bleed, Where Glory calls, to rush and die! Glory is not the blasting flame That burns around a Cæsar's head; Beneath the golden wreath of fame None but the wise and good may tread: The hand must toil, the foot must strive, No selfish feeling stain the breast, No passion wild-careering drive The soul, that longs for Glory's rest. Sweet after labor comes repose, And he who toils through life can die, His long career of honor close, With brow unruffled, tearless eye: He knows, though envy blot his name, When time has swept those clouds away That o'er the purest light will stray, No shade can dim his sun of fame. How sweet the calm that fills his breast, When after years of generous strife, He sinks, by every bosom blest, And bursts from pain to light and life! Around his brow the beams of glory play, And o'er him settles Heaven's eternal day. DITHYRAMBIC. I. Balmy juice of rich Madeira, How thy amber bubbles shine! How thy fragrance charms the weary, Soothing like a song divine! When thy nectar gayly flushes, And thy hues the goblet stain, How the mounting spirit rushes Lightly through the dancing brain! Every scene of sadness brightens, All is robed in vestment fair; How the cloud of sorrow lightens, As we sip, and banish care! Now the patriot bosom throbbing Swells to deeds of high renown; And the lover ceases sobbing, Though beneath his mistress' frown. Now, his eye with frenzy rolling, How the poet sweeps his lyre, While, no hand his fire controlling, Madness thunders o'er his wire! Fired by thee, he grasps the lightning, Hurls it fiercely through the air; And a wreath of glory bright'ning Flames around his waving hair. When my fancy, faintly drooping, Loses all its fire divine, Let me, o'er thy fountain stooping, Quaff the richly mantling wine. II. They may tell me, the sages who soberly think, That water was all that sire Adam would drink; They may tell of the calm, philosophical brain In those who from all that is kindling refrain,— What serene, energetic, and straight-forward thought, By living as Nature would have us, is bought;— They may keep their cool reason who like it,—be mine A fancy that glows in a bumper of wine. Our life was not made to flow out like a stream In the low lands of Holland; the soul's brightest beam Will die without feeding, as lamps without oil, And something reviving must water the soil. The dew may enliven the flowers of the spring, And a sprinkling of rain make the nightingale sing; But the heart cannot glow, and the eye cannot shine, Nor the tongue roll, unless in a bumper of wine. Bright nectar that foamed in the goblet of Jove! Thou quickener of fancy and kindler of love! By thee heroes rush without dread to the fight, And cheer the long watch through a cold, frosty night: When the orator seeks inspiration from thee, His words how commanding, expressive, and free! And ev'n the poor poet seems doubly divine, When he fills from Castalia a bumper of wine. Thy ruby-cheeked face is the idol for me; But the tenderer vessels hold nothing but tea, And that warm, cloudy spirit so weakens their prattle, Their nonchalant flippancy flows tittle-tattle: Though Hyson can call forth such lightness of heart, Where the voluble tongue plays unshackled by art, Yet their wit and their fancy are wondrously fine, When by chance they have sipped a bumper of wine. Then be mine in the storms and the winter of life, And fill up the place of friends, children, and wife; Be thou born on the orange-clad mountains of Spain, Or nursed in the green, sparkling fields of Champagne, In sea-girt Madeira, or sunny Tokay, Or where Italy laughs, all enlivened and gay,— May my last smile at parting complacently shine, Like the sun on the waves, in a bumper of wine. LOCH MAREE. Wouldst thou a scene of quiet view, When all is gemmed in evening dew,— When the fair planet's silver blaze On some lone water sweetly plays,— When every twinkling star of night Shines in the sky serenely bright, And on the rock, the wave, the tower, And on the lover's secret bower, Peace furls her pinions on her breast, And calls the weary world to rest,— When not a breath of wind is waking, And not an aspen-leaf is shaking,— When not a ripple beats the shore, And faintly swells the torrent's roar In yonder mountain vale,— When on the cliff the wild duck broods, And slumbers o'er the marble floods, Rocked by the dying gale,— When far around, in dewy bush And quiet grove, the minstrel thrush Reposes silently,— Go, at the hour of evening pale, Go, wander through the lonely vale, And view by moonlight Loch Maree. The western wind is gently blowing, The rising tide is softly flowing, Its billow heaves along the shore With rippling dash and solemn roar; The screaming gull has gone to rest, The puffin seeks her caverned nest, On curving wing the ospray soars, Where on the rocks the breaker pours, And, dashing 'mid the foamy brine, His plumes with dewy lustre shine. Descending on the ocean blue, Trickles from melting clouds the dew; The sun, that late with crimson vest Glowed on the billow's golden breast, No longer meets the gazing eye, Nor stains the ruddy evening sky; For sunk in Thetis' saffron bed, Each gleam of parting day has fled. The abbey bell is slowly ringing, The nun her vesper hymn is singing, The notes, resounding o'er the bay, Now sweetly swell, now die away: Seems, as the winding shores prolong The melody of sacred song, An angel's harp had caught the strain, And gave it to the distant main; Such sounds in mellow echoes roll, And wind their way into the soul. 'T is night, but o'er the peaceful bay The rising moon's unsullied ray Shines on its pure, unruffled breast, Where every wave is smoothed to rest. Beneath her light, the billows flow With quiet dash and mellow glow, And far around, the waveless main Seems spreading like a glassy plain; On distant rocks the mermaid weeps, While round her form the sturgeon leaps, And long she listens on the shore The ocean's faintly echoed roar; The sea-dogs, dashing through the foam, In sportive gambols wildly roam, And, rising lightly o'er the brine, Their skins like polished marble shine. Now up the brook, that gently flows, The moon in beam of silver glows, And through the vale, from lake to bay, Winds like a stream of light away; And where the brook, with ceaseless brawl, Tumbles along the sloping fall, With light all trembling and uneven It twinkles like the stars of heaven: But as you scale the mountain high, What scene of beauty meets the eye! Stretched through the vale a sheet of light, It bursts upon the startling sight, And back reflects the queen of night, Whose silver image, far below, Seems like a gliding orb of snow, So pure, so lovely o'er the billow— It sleeps as on a watery pillow: Around, above, below, in streams Of mellow radiance flow the beams, That silver o'er the sky, and shed Their rays on ocean's sandy bed; They shine on wood and lofty hall, They glitter on the castle wall, And tremble waveringly, Where, sitting in her lonely bower, In sorrow spends the moonlight hour The maid of Loch Maree. The glassy wave, the sandy shore, The rock with lichen covered o'er, The cliff that frowns, the wave that smiles, The gloomy firs, the willowy isles, The castle on the dizzy steep, Whose lamps their lonely vigils keep, In such repose are sunk, they seem The fancy of a poet's dream,— So fair, so peaceful, one might say It was a paradise that lay So far and deep below,— Some sweet Utopian scene of pleasure, Where angels dance in lightest measure, And seraph-warblings flow,— Or fairy-land, where sylphs might lave Their forms of beauty in the wave, And sport upon the balmy wind, To love and happiness resigned. Go, range the world from pole to pole, Go where Arcadia's streamlets roll, And Tempe's waters play,— Go, scale Parnassus' flowery steep, Go where Castalia's muses weep The mournful hours away,— Go, view each scene of loveliness, And tell, if thou canst ever grace A scene so fair and gay. [Adieu, my love, my Mary dear!] “Perhaps there is scarcely a man who has once experienced the genuine delight of virtuous love, however great his intellectual pleasures may have been, that does not look back to the period as the sunny spot in his whole life, where his imagination loves most to bask, which he recollects and contemplates with the fondest regret, and which he would most wish to live over again.”— Malthus. Adieu, my love, my Mary dear! Fair rose of innocence, adieu! The stifled sob, the burning tear, The trembling voice, are all for you; For I must cross the stormy main,— Already comes the parting day; But when on Plata's distant plain, I'll think of thee, though far away. Each scene of youthful joys gone by, That now in memory's chamber sleep, Shall often rise before my eye, And bid me think of thee and weep: And while reclining 'neath the palm, That rocks before the breeze's sway, O, to my spirit what a balm, To think of thee, though far away. The lonely vale, the quiet tower, The maple waving on the hill, Where oft at evening's balmy hour We listened to the murmuring rill,— Where oft we saw the glowing west, Rich with the hues of parting day,— Shall waken in my throbbing breast Sweet thoughts of thee, though far away. The pomp of wealth, the blaze of war, Shall ever seem a trifling dream, When, smiling o'er the main afar, I mark thy star's benignant beam; When sickness sinks my drooping head, This star shall shed a soothing ray, And cheer the lonely dying-bed With thoughts of thee, though far away. Adieu, my love, my Mary dear! Charm of my heart, a fond adieu! Forgive me if I shed a tear, Forgive me if I weep for you: The streamer wantons in the wind, The sailor shouts with spirits gay: O, bear my image in thy mind, I'll think of thee, though far away. HENRY AND MARY. The sun was sinking in the west, When Mary sought the birken grove; In snowy lawen simply drest, She came to meet her own true love. To meet her own true love she came, Just at the hour of gloamin' gray, To light anew her virgin-flame, And blend with his her softer ray. The dewy breath of evening blew, And rustled through the spangled brake; On wings of down the west-wind flew, And lightly curled the placid lake; Around on ilka brier and bush, The throstles sung their evening lay, And hoarsely swelled the torrent's rush, As down the glen it swept away. Through trembling boughs, that met the gale, And danced in wanton sportiveness, Light-waving streaks of lustre pale Shone on her maiden loveliness. As o'er her glowing cheek they played, They tinged it with a heavenly hue, And made the tear that down it strayed Smile like a pearl of Eden's dew. She rested on the mossy bank, And leaned upon a birken tree, Whose roots the crystal water drank, And swept its pure translucency. Why steals the tear along her cheek? Why seeks her eye the parting ray? She came her own true love to meet, But ah! her love was far away. The hand of death has closed his eye, And laid him in the soldier's grave; On honor's bed I saw him lie, And sleep the slumber of the brave. And ne'er shall Mary meet her love, And press him to her heaving breast; The dart of grief has pierced that dove, And death has hushed her woes to rest. She leant upon that birken tree, And saw the sun's departing beam, She saw the latest twilight flee, That silvered o'er that mountain stream. Her tears she mingled with the wave, And “Henry” trembled on her tongue; A voice cried, “Henry's in the grave, His corpse is cold, his knell has rung.” She started from her sorrowing trance, 'T was Henry's spirit caught her eye; He cast on her one pitying glance, Then melted in the evening sky. She shrieked,—an ashy hue o'erspread Her cheek,—she plunged beneath the wave, The waters circled o'er her head, And gave her broken heart a grave. [Star of my heart! though far away] Star of my heart! though far away The brightness of thy beauty shines, Thy soft and soul-dissolving ray With every thought and feeling twines; And though thy full and perfect glow, On other eyes and hearts is shed, In memory still thy bright beams flow, Like Heaven's own purest light, around my lonely head. How sweet to wander up the dell, And trace the wildly-roving stream, And, bending o'er the crystal well, To read the moon's reflected beam, The dancing light, the checkered glow, That o'er the bubbling fountain play! But sweeter are the beams that flow From thy pure loveliness, though glimmering far away. How sweet at sunset on the hill To look upon the purple ocean, When all that moves on earth is still, But that for-ever heaving motion! What hues of heaven around the throne Of day's departing monarch glow! O, sweeter still to view alone From thy blue melting eye love's hallowed lustre flow! Than moonlight sleeping on the spring, Than sunset purpling o'er the main, Than morning's rosy welcoming, Than night-dew sparkling on the plain, More sweet thy beams in memory shine: My last, last thoughts to thee are given; My heart, my soul, my all are thine; To think of thee is hope, to live with thee is heaven. [Star of my heart! thy light has gone] Star of my heart! thy light has gone, A cloud has hid it from my view, A night has come that has no dawn, A storm I cannot struggle through; For, like a boatman on the deep Without a compass, or an oar, Where wild winds howl, and tempests sweep, My life must still drift on, and find no port, no shore. Well,—I have toiled to reach a haven, Where joy at length in peace might dwell, And many a mountain billow braven, Still drawn by thy bewitching spell: It led me on through all that life Had dark and cold and hard for me, For still I hoped to end this strife, And that my last, bright days might sweetly flow with thee. Thou smil'dst, a beacon on that shore Where Fancy builds her airy bowers, And gems her grots with sparkling ore, And weaves her shady arch of flowers; And I did hope thy light would shine And charm with beam more warm and bright, And still I hoped its rays were mine:— A sullen cloud came o'er, and all was wrapped in night. But though my course is lone and wild, Through booming waves, and wreck and sorrow, I would be firm as when day smiled; Beyond the grave—there shines a morrow. Awhile chilled, harassed, dashed, and tost, Through raging seas I plough my way To some dark, undiscovered coast, Where hope holds out no flag, and mercy lights no ray. [I thought I loved,—no form of earth] I thought I loved,—no form of earth, A soul, a visioned shape of air, The teeming heart and fancy's birth, The image of all good and fair; It had a life, a place, a home, Had smile and glance and voice and tone; Like green fields in the ocean's foam, 'T was with me still when all alone. There was a Heaven upon its brow, An Eden in its happy eye; It charmed,—the sage may tell me how; It still has lived, it will not die,— In pain and pleasure, weal and woe, Has always been my heart's fond goal, The centre where my feelings flow, The point where all my wishes roll; The harmony of heart and thought, The smile that always answers smile, The peace that man disturbeth not, The pure, free spirit's happy isle; The words that glow, the eyes that sparkle, The hand that melts and clings to mine, The lips that smile when sorrows darkle, As, when storms revel, beacons shine; The flow, the mingled flow of mind, Through science, fancy, art, and lore, A feeling taste alike refined, A blending of each other's store; The perfect confidence, the thrill When kindred spirits join their whole, The joys unthought, untold, that fill, When heart loves heart, and soul loves soul. [Is there a tear that scalds the cheek?] Is there a tear that scalds the cheek? Is there a sigh the bosom rends? Is there a grief we cannot speak? 'T is at the last adieu of friends. The hearts that long have blent their cares Are by a thousand fibres twined, And cruel is the pang that tears The links that fasten mind to mind. But friends must part with those most dear, The severing pang their hearts must swell; Misfortune will extract the tear That trickles when we bid farewell. [To see a dear one close her eyes] To see a dear one close her eyes, With whom fond years have rolled away, When, mounting to her kindred skies, Her dying features sweetly play, This is no light nor transient woe; But there is hope to meet again, And those warm drops, that streaming flow, Are tears of joy as well as pain. Yes, hope will cheer the widowed heart, When weeping o'er the dear one's urn; But who can hope or joy impart To him whose love has no return? [There is an hour, a heavenly hour] There is an hour, a heavenly hour, When rapture swells my throbbing breast, When joy exerts her siren power To lull my cares and woes to rest: It is the hour of evening pale, Beside the maiden of my heart; 'T is when within the quiet vale We meet and hope no more to part. Let proud ambition boast his fame, And point where burns his glory-star; I envy not the hero's name, I care not for the blaze of war: Give me, when evening draws around The silent dell its rosy veil, To hear her harp's wild-warbling sound, And listen to her soothing tale. This is the star that charms my sight, The mildly beaming star of love; There is no star of purer light, That sparkles in the heavens above. Lay me beneath the willow's shade, Where softly sighs the evening gale, Love's paradise can never fade With Mary in the quiet vale. ['T is night,—but yet the moon is high] 'T is night,—but yet the moon is high, And floating round her shadowy throne The fleecy clouds in slumber lie, And gird her with a golden zone. The air is hushed, the leaves are still; The lake its glassy mirror spreads; The moonlight settles on the hill And silvers o'er the mountain-heads. There is a spirit in the wind,— It whispers peace into the soul; A balm that stills the ruffled mind, The heaving bosom's sweet control. Though passion sleeps, yet memory wakes, And fancy calls her airy train; A thousand blended hues she takes, And lost enjoyments live again. She summons up the raptured hour When life was pure, and thought was free, And, swayed alone by Nature's power, I roamed in careless liberty. My being's dawn, my days of feeling, The sunny spring-time of my soul, When the warm tide of life is swelling, And all our pulses wildly roll,— The days of health and joy and love, And glowing hopes and prospects high,— I see them—and my heart's fond dove, Her beck'ning smile, her speaking eye. Ah, thou art here!—I feel thy breath; It fans my pale and withered cheek, It starts me from my dream of death;— O, it is heaven to hear thee speak! And then to hang upon thee so, Those lips how sweet, how warm that kiss! What words of honey o'er them flow! Those liquid tones, how full of bliss! And how our meeting bosoms beat, And how our mutual feelings blend! I call thee love and life and sweet, And oh! thou say'st, my heart's sole friend. Our thoughts, our hopes, our joys are one, In one full tide our being rolls; This is the bosom's unison, The harmony of kindred souls. Our spirits burst the bands of earth, By love's o'erpowering influence driven; This is indeed a second birth, O, this it is to live in heaven! Begone, fond dream! I stand alone,— By night's chill dews my locks are wet, Love's paradise for ever flown, My sun in utter darkness set. Slow through my veins the ice-drops creep, My fancy's cherished vision fled, My feelings wrapt in endless sleep;— I live, but oh! my heart is dead. THE LAMP OF LOVE. Light the lamp of love,— Light it with a fire Falling from above, Sparkling with desire. When the flame is bright, Place it in the bower Where true hearts delight To pass the evening hour: It will softly shine Through the mantling leaves, Which the Graces twine, And affection weaves,— Weaves into a chain, With the smile of bliss, Melting looks that banish pain, And pure enjoyment's honeyed kiss. See! how bright it gleams, Like the evening star,— How its mellow beams Scatter wide and far, Lighting on his way, To the lonely bower, Him who loves to stray Round affection's modest flower, Him who loves the blush that glows On the cheek of innocence, Brightening like the dewy rose, And breathing like it to the sense. But there is a ray More delightful still, Beams that softlier play, Looks that sweetlier thrill; 'T is the eye whose light, Sparkling from the heart, Pours upon the night Joys that ne'er depart; 'T is the look that tells Love is living there, And, like the fairy's witching spells, Bids every scene enchantment wear. Ah! the light has faded In the darkened bower, Jealousy has shaded Every leaf and smiling flower. Can the dying beams Shine again as bright as ever? No! the demon's inky streams, When once they quench them, quench for ever. THE GALLEY SLAVE. How dark is the night! no planet is gleaming, To light the lost mariner over the wave; How dark is my fortune! no sunshine is beaming From Hope, on the poor galley slave. The mariner waits till the morning is breaking, When daylight shall point him his path to the shore; By night and by day the poor galley slave, waking, Must sigh as he tugs at the oar. Though cold be the storm on the wand'rer descending, And chill be the tempests that over him blow, Still Hope on this storm some few bright rays is blending, And smiles on the dark cloud of woe. But never shall Hope, to the poor galley slave, His friends or the love of his bosom restore; No, never, the wretch, till he sleeps in the grave, Must sigh as he tugs at the oar. And oft, as around him the billows were roaring, He struggled to sweep his broad oar through the wave, I've marked him in tears his lost freedom deploring, I've marked the poor heart-broken slave. “Ah! ne'er shall I meet my lost friends,” he was crying; “O, ne'er shall my woes and my sorrows be o'er!” Then faintly his voice on his pallid lips dying, He sighed as he tugged at the oar. When nature has sunk, and the poor galley slave, In short broken slumbers, is resting from pain, He dreams that he crosses the far distant wave, And meets with his Mary again. But soon from his slumber in anguish awaking, His fond dream of love and pleasure is o'er, And leaves him with naught, while his full heart is breaking, But to sigh as he tugs at the oar. ON THE DEATH OF MISS ?, WHO WAS DROWNED WHILE BATHING AT ?. The sun from his soft-swelling palace of blue Looked down on the waves of the ocean: O'er the breast of the billow the razor-bill flew, All hushed was its stormy commotion. The halcyon rocked on his wave-cradled bed, And slept on the surge as a pillow; The gulls flapped their wings o'er the mariner's head, As his bark ploughed the foam of the billow. Like the goddess of beauty, arrayed in her charms, When from Ida in triumph descending, Maria, unmindful of future alarms, O'er the breaker that rippled was bending. She saw in the wave, as it rolled on the shore, Her charms, with triumphant emotion, And little she thought, 'mid the billows' loud roar, How soon she should sleep in the ocean. Her maids stood around her, and scarce at her feet Ascended the soft-kissing billow; Ah! little they thought that an angel so sweet Should repose on a watery pillow. While securely they dipped in the scarce-heaving wave, That softly around them was swelling, The sea-nymphs were decking her coralline grave, And her parting bell slowly was knelling. A breaker arose, like the wave of the storm, It foamed with a wild, heaving motion, And dashed o'er the strand,—overwhelmed her fair form, And buried her deep in the ocean. A faint shriek was heard, and 't was silent again; She has gone,—she has vanished for ever: Long, long shall they seek for her corse in the main, But when shall they find it?—ah! never. On sea-weeds and corallines softly reclined, Maria is calmly reposing: Round her wave-polished bones the sea-mosses shall wind, Till time o'er the ocean is closing. And long shall the sea-boy, while wrapped in his dream, At midnight awake from his pillow, And wondering view, in the moon's silver beam, Her fair spirit glide o'er the billow. [Give me a lonely seat] Give me a lonely seat, Where she reposes, Where the rude billows beat, As the day closes, Where the waves on the shore, White with commotion, Raise the loud-pealing roar Over the ocean. There I would sadly rest On my cold pillow, There seek to soothe my breast Under the willow; But, O my Mary dear! Parted for ever, Comfort I cannot hear, Never, O, never! Oft when the silver beam Kisses the billow, Oft shall my sorrow stream Under the willow; And though the midnight storm Howls o'er the ocean, Still I shall view thy form, Rapt in emotion. Billows are roaring, And ocean is swelling, I am deploring, My death-bell is knelling. O, in the stormy main, Loving for ever, When can we part again? Never, O, never! Oft shall the mariner, Ploughing the billow, Start from his slumber Of peace on his pillow; Then, while the moonbeam Is silvering the ocean, And the wave tosses him With its light motion,— Then shall he view us glide, Like a bright vision, Over the heaving tide, Sweetly Elysian. O, can the stormy main Hearts so fond sever? O, can we part again? Never, O, never! THE VIOLET. Among all the sweet-blooming flowers of the spring, That deck every meadow, and scent every gale, There is none to my heart such a transport can bring As the violet that blossoms unseen in the vale. The rose may delight with its odors and blushes, We may hang on the lily's leaves tender and pale, Hues of beauty may glow on the laurel's gay bushes, But lovelier the violet that blooms in the vale. Though the earliest dawn of the morning should find me Inhaling the fragrance that breathes in the gale, I would leave all the flowers of the garden behind me, To view the sweet violet that blooms in the vale. When the fields are one flower-bed, all blooming and gay, And far-floating clouds of aroma exhale; Still, no hues in the sunbeams so pleasingly play As those on the violet that blooms in the vale. I have seen many beauties in woman's soft form,— In the cheek gay with hope, or with sorrow all pale; But none could my heart so delightfully charm As the maiden that bloomed in obscurity's vale. At the accent of joy, O how bright was her eye! How she wept when she listened to pity's soft tale! From every gay beauty of fashion I'd fly, To the maiden who bloomed in obscurity's vale. [How sweet is the turf on the grave of my friend] How sweet is the turf on the grave of my friend, Where the joy of my heart, wrapt in slumber, reposes! On the dew-spangled sod how the morning rays blend, Like the bright, airy colors that evening discloses! And bright be the rays,—for a soul that was bright As the star of the morning here peacefully slumbers: O where is the mortal so dear to my sight! O what sounds are so sweet as his harp's lively numbers! He tuned all the chords of his harp to a strain— It seemed as if angels were waking their lyres: There seemed every wild-warbling bird on the plain, When his fingers swept gracefully over the wires. But there always was heard in his liveliest notes A slight strain of sorrow, that breathed in my ear, As when on the west-wind the dirge sweetly floats, And from the eye gently elicits the tear. I have heard him, when sorrowful, pour on the gale Such soft notes of sadness, I wept at the sound; It seemed that the turtle-dove's heart-breathing wail Was filling the pines that waved gloomily round. He would sweep o'er the chords all the power of his arm, And wake such a strain,—'t was alive to my soul,— So sweet, 't would each pang of my bosom disarm, And bid all my feelings in ecstasy roll. But, minstrel of Nature! thy soul breathes no more, Thine eye darts no longer enlivening fire; O, ne'er shall thy harp its wild witchery pour,— No descant of sorrow e'er flow from thy lyre. Life's sea was too stormy for bosoms like thine,— As well might the child front the tempest's loud wave; But I'll often retire to weep over thy shrine, And the turf shall for ever grow green on thy grave. [Rest, O my lyre! till the winter of sorrow] Rest, O my lyre! till the winter of sorrow Is gone, and the spring-tide of pleasure return: It may kindle its smile ere the dawn of to-morrow, And shake the sweet dews of delight from its urn. Then let thy strings, brushed by fancy's light wings, Breathe the music of joy in the listener's ear: Then let thy note, like the nightingale's, float, Lighting rapture's gay smile, stealing pity's soft tear. Though I should tune to the key-note of gladness Thy chords, yet the blast of the winter's chill wind Would wake them to naught but the moaning of sadness, To an air that would sink, not enliven the mind. Rest then, my lyre, awhile!—rest till with vernal smile Spring decks the mead and enkindles the grove; Then let the zephyr's wings brush gently o'er thy strings, Waking them all to the music of love. Now I am sorrowful,—tears give me pleasure: Hush then thy music,—be silent my lyre! For thy strings, tuned to grief's mournfullest measure, Wake in my heart an enlivening fire; When pleasure wreathes my head, and sorrow's tear has fled, Then let the wind kiss thy chords as it flies, Wafting a strain along, sweet as the robin's song, Bidding joy sparkle in beauty's blue eyes. Lyre of my soul! sorrow's dark clouds are breaking; Smiles through their gloom the clear azure of bliss, Every sweet warbler of rapture is waking, Every vale listens to love's fondest kiss. Now to the passing wind be all thy chords resigned, Let each gay pinion, that shines in its wing, Wake all thy melody, swell all thy wild notes high, Till rock and wood with thy ecstasy ring. [She's gone, the idol of my heart] She's gone, the idol of my heart,— She's gone, alas! for ever. Could Heaven such tender lovers part, Such links of fondness sever? So strong we twined the chain of love, We thought no force could break it; Such flowers within its links we wove, 'T was sweet as bliss could make it. It was a silken, flowery chain, And soft as downy pinions; So bright its links, night shows in vain Heaven's glittering “starred dominions.” And oh! I thought no power so strong, This chain of love to sever; But ah! her vows were but a song,— She's gone, alas! for ever. There is an angel in her eye, So modest, sweet, and charming; And when her sudden glances fly, The bosom's peace alarming, Reason cannot withstand her power, Its light by passion shaded: So falls the blooming April flower, 'T is plucked, rejected, faded. O save me from a woman's eye! There is a fiend within it. O, guard me from a woman's sigh, For death is breathing in it. She smiles, enchants us, then betrays; Her charms are man's undoing, And in her flowery paths there strays The harbinger of ruin. You cannot tell when woman loves, For all she does is smiling; And when those charming lips she moves, 'T is all for man's beguiling; And though her face like heaven is fair, Each dart of Cupid wielding, Her heart is still like gossamer, As fluttering and as yielding. Each idle glance can make her sigh A moment, and 't is over. There 's nothing like a woman's eye, So wild, so light a rover. She loves the coxcomb when he smiles, And poets when they praise her; But gold alone has those dear wiles That can to rapture raise her. Then go, thou false unmeaning thing,— Go, and begone for ever! Shalt thou again my bosom wring, And steal my tears?—No, never! [When the winter of sorrow's keen tempests are blowing] When the winter of sorrow's keen tempests are blowing, There is naught can the gloom of affliction beguile, O, there 's nothing can set all my spirits a-flowing, Like the playfulness sporting in woman's soft smile! To me, 't is the sweet-beaming star of the morning, When it shines o'er the fields all bespangled with dew; Or the rose in its full bloom the valley adorning, When the Spring spreads its flowers, and the sky is all blue. You may lay my lorn head on the pillow of anguish, You may draw round my couch the dark curtain of woe, By night and by day I may painfully languish, While the big drops of sorrow unceasingly flow: But the sweet smile that breathes on the lips that are dear, All my anguish can soothe, all my sorrow remove; When woman looks kindly, I dry every tear; O, there's nothing can charm like the smile of my love! When the Spring blooms delightfully, clothing the scene With sweet-breathing festoons of lilacs and roses, And veils every meadow in Nature's pure green, Where the eye as on pillows of softness reposes,— Though this scene every thorn of affliction beguiles, And smooths every passion to quiet repose, There is nothing like beauty all beaming with smiles, Like the play of her lips, and her cheek's blooming rose. [When I roam o'er the fields at the opening of dawn] When I roam o'er the fields at the opening of dawn, On the flowers that bloom round how enchanted I dwell! But sweeter the dew-drops that spangle the lawn, And dearer the gem in the gay blossom's bell: So when beauty is beaming and blooming around, Though her bloom and her smile to my bosom are dear, Yet dearer the eye that is bent on the ground, And sweeter the ray of affliction's soft tear. When the blossoms of Nature are spangled with dew, Or wet with the drops of the Spring's gentle shower, O, there's naught in creation more sweet to my view, And that which droops most is the loveliest flower: So when beauty is weeping, her charms are more dear, Those tears all her blushes, like rainbows, illume; And oh! the most charming and heavenly tear A fair sister sheds on a loved brother's tomb. [I was once happy and blest] I was once happy and blest; But pleasure has flown from me long. I was once love and caressed; But my loves only live now in song. I was once cheerful and gay, The rose on my cheek spread its bloom; But the roses have faded away, And left but the hue of the tomb. Pleasure once beamed in my eye,— O how blithely I laughed and I sung! But those moments of bliss are gone by, And my bower all with mourning is hung. They called me an angel, and smiled, And I smiled, and believed they spoke true; O, how my weak heart was beguiled! I was ruined,—then bidden adieu. Ye who exult in your youth And your beauty, be taught by my tear; O, listen to nothing but truth, And close on the flatterer your ear. [Arabia may boast of its coffee-clad mountains] Arabia may boast of its coffee-clad mountains, And frankincense thickets that sweeten its gales; I love my green meadows, and clear-flowing fountains, My hills gently swelling, and soft-winding vales. When morning is glowing, or evening is fading, These scenes all the beauties that soften us wear; For reclined on the seat, which the vine-leaves are shading, I listen the music of Mary, my fair. The blossoms that grow in Peruvian bowers May sparkle with colors more vivid and bright; But still the soft charms of our dew-breathing flowers Are sweeter to sense and more dear to the sight: So the maiden—whose smiles, like the ray of the morning, Can soften the bosom and free it from care, Whom roses and lilies and diamonds adorning Have fashioned an angel—is Mary my fair. [Dear little angel of my heart] Dear little angel of my heart, How full of life thy cheek is flushing! But when I tell thee we must part, How softly pure thy tears are gushing! Though thou art but the opening bloom, The promise of a richer treasure; Thy breath is still love's sweet perfume, Thy smile, the dearest smile of pleasure. But love with thee is heavenly love, And pleasure—O how pure, how holy! The fondness of a cooing dove, That toys and sports, nor dreams of folly. Sweet innocent, O, I could dream Of thy pure angel-charms for ever, Could sun me in thine eye's warm beam, And when thou smil'st, be sad—O, never! I love thee as I love the child, When on its mother's bosom smiling, And low she sings her murmur wild, The startled cherub's fears beguiling. Thy flaxen locks, thine eyes of blue, Thy ruby lips all sweetly blooming, Thy smile, like roses wet with dew, The murmuring breath of morn perfuming,— Thy glance, that smiles when joy is nigh, Now through the tear of pity stealing, When faintly bursts the stifled sigh, And sweetly breathes the voice of feeling,— O, when I gaze on charms so bright, So heavenly fair, so richly glowing, I feel a thrilling, pure delight Through every vein and fibre flowing: As if my eyes beheld a form Of cherub-light from Heaven descending, With looks that speak affection warm, O'er sorrow's couch in pity bending. O, dearest! thou art happy now, No pang thy bosom's peace alarming; Contentment smiles upon thy brow, And virtue—O how pure, how charming! And let it not disturb thy rest, That soon thou meet'st a world of sorrow; But from the heaven within thy breast, The aid to bear its evils borrow. And O, my dear,—my only dear,— Should fate the bands that twine us sever, I still would shed the bitter tear, And think of Mary—O, for ever! [Come, come away, unto the silent grove] Come, come away, unto the silent grove, And in this solitude Indulge thy melancholy mood, And weep for fruitless love: Come, come and seek the cedar's shade; Beneath its gloomy shadow laid, List to the turtle's mournful lay, That fills the solemn hush around, Broke by this soft-lamenting sound, Until it dies away. There lie and let thy tears unceasing flow; Indulge thy swelling grief, Until thou find'st a sweet relief, A balm for all thy woe; For tears can soothe the anxious breast, Compose affliction's throb to rest, Instil a holy calm of peace, A calm that lights a placid smile Upon our lips, and bids awhile Our melancholy cease. Then rise and seek the brightly flowering field. And, as you careless stray, Hear the brisk songsters warbling gay, And taste the joy they yield: Then think no more of cruel love; But let thy thoughts unfettered rove, And o'er the landscape wander free; And while thou feel'st relief from pain, O, never, never think again That Mary 's deaf to thee. [One evening, when the sky was blue] One evening, when the sky was blue, When Spring was clad in greenest hue, When gently fell the cooling dew, I saw sweet Mary. The roses bloomed upon her cheek, Her sparkling eye, though bright, was meek, 'T was music, when I heard her speak. Ah! dearest Mary. Her forehead, white as drifted snow, Was soft as downy plumes, that flow Wide o'er the fields, when zephyrs blow. Ah! dearest Mary. Her look, the picture of her mind, By every charm and grace refined, To calmest musing seemed resigned. Ah! dearest Mary. She sung,—her sweetly soothing strain Floated along the flowery plain, So sweet, the robin sings in vain. Ah! dearest Mary. Her voice was still,—her hand she threw Around her robe, and lightly flew, Brushing the faintly glistening dew. Ah! dearest Mary. Entranced in bliss, I saw her fly, Fair as the moon that gilds the sky, Sailing enrobed in silver dye. Ah! dearest Mary. And when I laid me down to rest, I saw her smile, in beauty drest, And clasped her vision to my breast. Ah! dearest Mary. We roamed through cool and shady groves, We told our pure, unsullied loves, We kissed with hearts as true as doves'. Ah! dearest Mary. O may this vision ne'er depart, But dwell for ever round my heart, Untouched by disappointment's dart! Ah! dearest Mary. Then I, a cheerful, happy swain, With her, a nymph, might rove the plain, Nor ever, ever leave again My dearest Mary. [I love the ruddy cheek, that glows] I love the ruddy cheek, that glows Bright as the crimson-flowering rose, That in the Spring most sweetly blows; But yet I love to see, More than this cheek that brightly glows, The eye that sparkles brilliantly. I love the arm of fairest snow, Round as the tapering trees that grow, Where streams in purest currents flow; But yet I love to see, More than this arm of fairest snow, The eye that sparkles brilliantly. I love the jetty, curling hair, That floats around the bosom fair, And waves in tresses on the air; But yet I love to see, More than this jetty, curling hair, The eye that sparkles brilliantly. I love the gently heaving breast, In robe of milky softness drest, By love and all the graces prest; But yet I love to see, More than this gently heaving breast, The eye that sparkles brilliantly. I love the lips like ruby flowers, That blow amid the sweetest bowers, Smiling as wet with dewy showers; But yet I love to see, More than these lips like ruby flowers, The eye that sparkles brilliantly. I love the tender hand, whose white Seems melting to the enamored sight, And calls to bowers of pure delight; But yet I love to see, More than this hand of melting white, The eye that sparkles brilliantly. I love the artless, winning form, Whose easy gracefulness can charm And fill the heart with soft alarm; But yet I love to see, More than this artless, winning form, The eye that sparkles brilliantly. The mind imbued with wisdom's lore, And rich in learning's fairest store, Than sparkling eye delights me more,— Yes, I had rather see The mind imbued with wisdom's lore, Than eye that sparkles brilliantly. The breast that feels another's woes, With charity intensely glows, And the kind heart of feeling shows,— Yes, I had rather see The breast that feels another's woes, Than eye that sparkles brilliantly. The life that flows in gentle love, That would each passing hour improve, And tread the path to worlds above,— Yes, I had rather see The life that flows in gentle love, Than eye that sparkles brilliantly. May all these charms and graces blend, And beauty, love, and wit attend The feeling heart, the tender friend; Oh! I would love to see The form, the heart, the spirit, blend With eye that sparkles brilliantly. [Who is that mourner bending o'er yon grave] Who is that mourner bending o'er yon grave, Whose glistening tears flow down her pallid cheek, Whose voice, like cooing dove's, Is full of plaintive woe? A mother, weeping for her infant dear,— A smiling babe, who, like the early flower, Just blossomed for a day, And then was seen no more. See how her tears bedew that verdant grave, And on that slowly-waving blade of grass, Mark how that crystal drop Shines in the moon's pale beam. Ah! listen to her softly uttered tale, Which, touching all the chords of sympathy, Bids the unsullied tear Stand in the stranger's eye. “Ah! lovely babe, sweet image of thy sire, Who in the stormy bosom of the deep, Ere thou hadst seen the light, Found his cold, watery grave: “I fondly hoped to rear thy angel form, To make thee first and fairest of the fair, In every virtuous grace, In every mental charm. “This cheering thought enlivened all my toil, This sweetened all my anxious, watchful hours, When through the wintry night I hushed thy cries to rest. “Oft I would look upon thy sleeping form, And the calm smile that played upon thy lips, And when I saw thee move, Would sing my lullaby. “But cruel death thy opening blossom nipped, And laid thee low within the silent tomb, And robbed me of my sole, My sole surviving joy. “Ah! can I tell the agony I feel, The cruel pang that wrung my bleeding heart, When hollow-sounding clods Fell in thy narrow grave? “How pleasing—to behold thy early bloom, Like morning flowers; but ah! how mournful too— So sweet to taste of bliss, So soon to lose its balm! “Soon I shall leave this tenement of clay, Soon I shall meet thee and thy much-loved sire, Above yon starry sky, In one eternal Heaven. “For o'er my cheek the lily's hue is spread, And scarce the pulses beat within my heart, While death, with awful voice, Rings loudly in my ear. “But I can leave this mournful world with joy, Can view the last recess of parting life, And feel the icy chill Creep through my withered veins.” [See, how the clear, unsullied streamlet strays] See, how the clear, unsullied streamlet strays Along the windings of the blossomed vale, And o'er the gentle slope Dashes its crystal flood: With soothing sweetness slowly tinkles on, Rippling around the verdant, mossy stone, Or in the unruffled pool A pearly mirror shows: Now murmurs softly o'er its gravelly bed, Now silent curls along a sandy shoal, And now beneath a root Its lucid current hides. Emerging thence, it scarcely steals along, Where bubbles tinged with rainbows lightly glide, And, dancing on the wave, Are broken by the gale. Now, standing in a pool, the whispering breeze Uprears the water, pure as new-fallen snow, And throws it wildly round In every lovely form. It flows thus sweetly through the silent vale, In youthful gentleness, until, increased By rills and cool, clear springs, It swells into a brook. Louder the murmur rises on the gale, And dashed along the rudely broken steep, O'ertopped with whitest foam, The billows tumble on. Now sunk to peace, the unambitious stream Floats in broad current o'er the smiling mead, Reflecting as a glass The lily's snowy bloom. Again it darts with loud increasing roar Along the rapid, pouring o'er the rocks, And swelling on the breeze, That waves the boughs above. At last it plunges in a dark abyss, And throws amid the cliffs, that rise around, The gayly colored spray, As sets the evening sun. 'T is lost,—for in a hoarse-resounding cave, Retiring from the ken of mortal eye, It hides its manly flood Within the mountain's womb. Thus the bright youth, whom genius raises high Above the ignoble throng that grovel round, Passes his boyish days In playful innocence. To him, the mellow flute's melodious lay, The fair one's sweetly uttered song of love, Are charming as the strains That heavenly angels sing. To him the cool, retired grotto's still And gloomy solitude is sweeter far Than all the pomp of wealth, Than all the glare of pride. Unnoticed and unknown he tunes his lyre, And weaves the lovely hymn of melody, Unheard but by the grove, That shields him from the sun. But when his genius forms the manly song, And from his lips the patriot accents breathe, He seeks the mountain's brow, And dwells amid the storm. Thus fair he rises, like the towering pine That on Monadnock courts the cloudless sky, And fondly hopes to gain The highest seat of fame. But stranger to the baser arts of life, By disappointment sunk into the grave, And crushed by power and pride, He slumbers in the dust. TO THE ROSE. I. Tender rose-bud! sweetly blooming,— Drooping with the dews of morn, Every sighing breeze perfuming, As it flutters round thy thorn;— Tender rose-bud! soon thy blossom, Nursed by dews, and fed by light, Will unfold its velvet bosom, Spreading beauty to the sight. Then, sweet bud, I'll softly pluck thee, Drooping low with early dew; Then to Mary will I give thee, She whose cheek is thine own hue. When the dew-drops, sweetly shining, Gently to my lips are prest, In the woodbine bower reclining, I will lay thee on her breast. Could I, like thee, flower of feeling, Rest upon her bosom fair, Like the bee its sweetness stealing, I would dwell for ever there. II. Fairest Nymph of lovely Flora, Brightest beauty of the Spring, See, around thy kindling glory, How the zephyr sports his wing. When Aurora gayly flashes, Rising from her saffron bed, O, what richly crimson blushes Wanton round thy drooping head! When the morning-glory closes In the sultry noontide air, O, how soft the bee reposes, Humming on thy bosom fair! When the zephyrs, gently blowing, All the sweets of nature bring, Round thy virgin beauties glowing, See, the hummer spreads his wing. When the breezy breath of morning Calls him to his airy flight, How his hues, thy bloom adorning, Glitter in the dawning light! When the evening shades are blending In the gay enamelled west, See, the dews of night, descending, Softly slumber on thy breast. Blooming Nature's sweetest blossom! Let me pluck, in morning's hour, To adorn Maria's bosom, Thy enchanting, dewy flower. III. See, the rose is freshly glowing Through its veil of morning dew; Round it perfumed gales are blowing, Sweeter ne'er in Eden blew. May has clad the tangled bower In a robe of softest green, Blended every early flower,— But the rose is Flora's queen. Showers of bloomy snow, descending From the pear-tree, deck the mead; Honeysuckles richly blending Weave their many-tinctured brede. When the first spring cloud is flying, What the flower that freshest glows? Sweet when blooming, sweet when dying, O, the fair Idalian rose! See the sylph on emerald pinions Lightly woo the floweret's smile, Ranging Flora's bright dominions, Sip at each and stay awhile: When the rose's breathing blossom By his ruby throat is prest, Lights he on its yielding bosom, Furls his wings and sinks to rest. Though, the exotic bower adorning, India's richest blossom glows, Give me, wet with dews of morning, Give, O, give the breathing rose! [I saw a flower of softest hue] I saw a flower of softest hue Within a lonely vale, Around its head serenely blew The evening's dewy gale; The gem was sparkling in its bell, 'T was like the mourner's tear, And like the dirge of sorrow fell The zephyr on my ear. The scene that bloomed around was calm, The sky was softly blue, The zephyr breathed its sweetest balm, And gently fell the dew; At that mild hour, when lovers lie Beneath the maple shade, This modest floweret met my eye, This beauty of the glade. With careful, trembling hand, I raised The floweret from its bed, And on its weeping beauties gazed, And kissed its balmy head; Then laid it gently on my heart, And pressed the treasure there, And whispered, “We will never part, Thou fairest of the fair! “Though pale the tints, that deck thy leaf Upon its ground of snow, Thy dew-drops like the tear of grief, That gems the eye of woe,— Though thou recall'st the dying bed, Where mourners weep sincere, The chamber where the pall is spread, And dirges soothe the ear,— “For this, sweet flower, I love thee more Within the lonely vale, When bending o'er the riv'let's shore, I list the turtle's wail: For round thy unobtrusive form Soft-breathing odors dwell, Beauties that like enchantment warm, And calm the bosom's swell.” TO THE GENTIANA CRINITA, THE LAST FLOWER OF AUTUMN. Sweet floweret of the waning year, Last blossom of the fading plains, The leaves are falling wan and sere, And the lone, widowed bird complains: Still thou art dearer to my heart, Than all the sweets the Spring unveils; Thy blooms a softer mood impart, Than violets breathing in the vales. There is a melancholy grace, That spreads thy lonely petals o'er; They tell that winter comes apace, That soon will rise the tempest's roar. The flowers decay, the fields are bare, The humble violet fears to blow, The woods no more their honors wear, Light rustling fall the leaves below. Still thou unfold'st thy lovely leaf, And smil'st amid the fields alone, Thou seem'st some weeping child of grief, That mourns her every comfort flown, Had I not roved the desert plain, Where 'neath the hedge you sweetly blew, Your petals had been spread in vain, Your only guest the evening dew. Or when amid the leafless wood The blue-bird chirped with drooping wing, He might have o'er thy beauty stood, And sung his lay, and thought it Spring. How richly purple is thy hue, Thy fringe like beauty's ebon rays, Where the eye's lustre glances through, And meeker shines its living blaze. In vain the pencil would essay To give thy form its native grace; How weaker still the feeble lay, That would thy mellow features trace! Where'er I meet thee on the plains, Thy beauties to my soul how dear! How worthy thou of higher strains, Sweet floweret of the waning year! [Can I touch my harp again?] Can I touch my harp again? Can I wake its mellow strain? In the damp it long has hung, Long its chords have been unstrung, Moss around its frame has twined, It has only felt the wind, All its soothing tones have slept In the shade where dews have wept, Scarce a sigh the wind has breathed Through its strings, by grasses wreathed: Though it long unused has lain, I will touch my harp again. I will touch my harp again, Wake it to a cheerful strain; Like the whispering breeze, that flings Sweetness from its waving wings, It shall shed on all around Notes that softly, sweetly sound. Come, my harp, and let me try, If my fingers now can fly As they could when youth was high. Age has numbed them,—cankering care Chilled my heart, and planted there ('Stead of love and joy and pleasure, Mirth that wakes the frolic measure) Sorrow for a world of woe, And grief, whose tears for ever flow: Spite of this, a cheerful strain Shall my harp awake again. Autumn smiles, the sky is blue: Let me for an hour or two Draw thee from thy rest of years, Brush away thy dewy tears, Brighten up thy chords again, And wake them to a cheerful strain. They will bid my sorrows fly, They will light my fading eye; Only for a fleeting hour Let me feel their soothing power; Let me, while they breathe of love, All my griefs, my woes remove; Though the joy is short, 't is dear:— Cease to flow, thou falling tear, For I wake my harp again To a sweetly soothing strain. [Give me the lyre of harmony] Give me the lyre of harmony To calm the passions of my soul, O, wake its choral symphony, And bid it with my griefs condole. Sweet are the echoes of its strings, Sweet as the sylvan choir of May, When on the rose the robin sings, And hails with song the rising day. And though the storm, that gathers round, Be cold as winter's blasting wind, Still can this lyre's bewitching sound Beguile my lorn and widowed mind. Though love is fled, and friends are gone, This lyre, my solace, lingers nigh:— O, leave me not to droop alone, But be thy music whispering by! And what shall ease my troubled heart? Shall Roslin's voice of sorrow flow, Or shall thy trembling chords impart A deeper, darker strain of woe? I hear it swell,—the death-march rings, The muffled drum is rolling by, The burning tear of sorrow springs And trickles from the melting eye. The bier, with slow and solemn tread, Attired in sables, steals along, And o'er the grave's cold, earthy bed The minstrel pours his broken song. The notes ascend,—the shriek and scream Alternate mingle in the lay; They fall,—like night's unreal dream, The wail of anguish melts away. Again it strikes the watchful ear, Convulsed with sobs and choked with sighs; What bursts of agony I hear,— A groan as when a sinner dies! How sweet, when sorrow clouds the soul, To hear thy strains funereal flow, To hear the burst of anguish roll, And listen to the wail of woe! And when my heart is flowing o'er, Come, weave thy choral symphony, Come, bid my bosom ache no more, Thou witching lyre of harmony. [My heart is sad, my harp is still] My heart is sad, my harp is still, It hangs upon the willow-tree; No hand shall wake its lively trill, No strain shall e'er enliven me. The serpent care has stung my heart, And left his venom in my soul; No balm can heal the cruel smart, No hand my bosom's pangs control. No,—I must sit me down and die: Far better, far—to die, than live; For death is but a pang and sigh, And what can life beside them give? Far better, far—to close our eyes, And slumber in the dust below; In peace the toil-worn sufferer lies, In death he found his kindest foe. Then let me dry my tears, and wake My harp to some funereal strain, Then all its chords of sweetness break, And seek the silent grave again. BOAT SONG. We rest at Peter's Point to-night,— Blow light, ye winds! flow smooth, ye billows! The promised headland heaves in sight, Where we shall stay, till morning light, And bind our bark beneath the willows. Heave, boatmen! heave, and sweep the oar; Soon we shall drown all care and sorrow. Bend to the willow-bordered shore, And there repose till early morrow. We rest at Peter's Point to-night,— And now we hear its billows breaking; The golden sun is setting bright, The wild swans take their homeward flight, The owl her lonely hoot is waking. Heave, boatman! heave, and sweep the oar, And dash the white foam from the billows; Bend to the soft and sandy shore, And bind the bark beneath the willows. And now the boat draws nigh to land, The winds blow light and kiss the billows; The boatmen leap upon the strand, And draw their bark upon the sand, And bind it fast beneath the willows. Now, boatmen! rest upon the oar,— The sun has set, your toils are over. Eat, drink, and dream of care no more, And sing, “How gay the Western rover! [They say, that esteem is a diamond so bright] They say, that esteem is a diamond so bright, It enkindles the eye that by sorrow is shaded; But glory to me is the sun's dazzling light, That illumines a world, which in darkness had faded. You may dwell on esteem's twinkling diamond who will, And love the faint gleam of its scarce-living fire: I gaze on the sun's dazzling brilliancy still, And ask no esteem if the world but admire. Esteem is the dew-drop that freshens the flower; Admiration, the arched hues that splendidly shine. The one is a sprinkle, the other a shower,— Let mine be the rainbow, the dew may be thine. Esteem is a maiden, whose blue, melting eye, When she smiles or she weeps, all in languishment moves; Admiration, a beauty, whose love-arrows fly, Like the falcon-glance, killing wherever she roves. One's cheek is a rose, that is shaded with dew; The other's a russet, with vermeil tints brightening. One's eye is an orb, softly, tearfully blue; The other's jet-black, but it flashes like lightning. One's air is so melting, so mournfully sweet, You love, and you pity, but cannot admire; In the other, such soul-killing blandishments meet, That she wakes in the breast every wild-raging fire. Then talk as they will of esteem's gentle form, Of those eyes, that so tenderly, meltingly roll: Let mine be the sun-burst, the bolt of the storm, That dazzles, astounds, and subdues every soul. ['T is morning, and all is gay around] 'T is morning, and all is gay around;— The sunbeam flames on the billow, And sparkles along the dewy ground, While I'm dreaming on my pillow; The music that breathes cannot bid me wake, Though like siren melody closing, While slumber's soft wings all their opiates shake O'er the couch, where I'm reposing. But Nature wears her loveliest smile, The smile of her maiden beauty, And while she invites by the softest wile, I hear the loud call of duty: Then I'll sleep not beneath the morning's beam, That smiles like affection upon me, Nor longer lie wrapt in slumber's dream, Though she shower all her roses on me. It is sweeter to breathe the balmy breeze Than to dream of the brightest vision; And dearer to view the wide-waving trees Than fancy's scenes Elysian: Though the one every hue of loveliness wears, Though like bloomy Eden charming, Yet she leaves us too soon to think of our cares, While her softness the heart is disarming: O, who would be happy in fancy alone, When reality's self can delight us, Or be charmed with a smile, that is instantly flown, When long-living beauties invite us? Then I'll sleep not, &amp;c. How oft in my childhood's lovely days, When I woke with the lark from my slumbers, I loved the sun's first-brightening rays, And the warbler's waking numbers; And while each dewy bush and brake Was vocal with sounds of gladness, And while the sun glowed on the lake, How could I be sunk in sadness! O, in morning's earliest, brightest dawn, There are charms more sweetly smiling, Than in dearest scenes by Fancy drawn, Though like beauty's self, beguiling! Then I'll sleep not, &amp;c. Now the birds are singing their amorous notes Amid the boughs wide-waving; And the whispered sigh of the zephyr floats Where the brooks their banks are laving; And now is the time, when all is bright, And in softest peace reposing, To kindle affection's purest light, Where the sprays of the bower are closing; Then love will burn with a brighter ray, And smile with a glance more tender, And dearer charms on his features play, While our hearts to his sway we render. Then I'll sleep not beneath the morning's beam, That smiles like affection upon me, Nor longer lie wrapt in slumber's dream, Though she shower all her roses on me. [Why slumbers thy lyre, which so often resounded] “Why slumbers thy lyre, which so often resounded With the trill of delight and the warble of love, By whose lively numbers the heart featly bounded, Which so often the sweet wreath of melody wove? “Why sleeps it so silently? Is there no lover That asks for its strain with his heart to condole? Are there no light pinions, that carelessly hover, To wake all its sweetness, and kindle its soul? “Why hangs on the willow thy harp of delight? Why loves it the gloom of those low-drooping boughs? Why hides it so deeply in shadows of night, And asks for no hand its wild sweetness to rouse? “Has the hand of the bard lost its magical skill? Is it palsied with sickness, or nerveless with woe? Are its fingers benumbed by cold poverty's chill, That they bid not its wild notes enchantingly flow?” “'T is not sickness or sorrow that palsies my arm; 'T is not poverty's winter that weakens its powers; 'T is what can the hero's bold spirit disarm, And start the salt tear in love's amaranth-bowers. “'T is because no sweet pæans are swelling my fame, No halo of glory encircles my brow: 'T is because no dear maid fondly dwells on my name, Kindly smiles when we meet, and repeats the warm vow. “When my spirits are sunk, when despondency reigns, I hang up my harp on the low-drooping willow. How can I then waken its soft-breathing strains? How can pleasure look smiling on grief's thorny pillow? “Should I tune my sweet harp, how discordant would sound All its chords, when the demon is wringing my soul! The strain would depress even mirth's lightest bound, And sadden the eyes that in ecstasy roll. “When you hear no light strain from my grot gently flow, When you scarce hear a breath in the willow's dark grove, Then know, that my bosom is bursting with woe, For fruitless ambition, and fond, hopeless love. “When scarce a faint warble is heard on the wire, And sounds o'er the chords slowly, dyingly move, O, there's nothing can kindle anew my lost fire, But the meteor of fame and the soft light of love!” AN IMPRECATION. Ismir! fare thee well for ever! From they walls with joy I go, Every tie I freely sever, Flying from thy den of woe. Thou my swelling heart hast riven, Torn my every hope away; May, for this, the arm of Heaven Mark thee for its destined prey. May the knell of ruin tolling, Wake thee from thy feverish dream, While the awful bolt is rolling, And the hags of vengeance scream. May the bird of desolation, On its wings of ebon hue, Shrieking death and devastation, Rest and hover over you. May the owl, at midnight screaming, Lighting on yon lofty tower, Tell each soul, in horror dreaming, How the clouds of ruin lower. May an awful bolt of thunder From those clouds of blackness burst, Rending all thy walls asunder, Scatter them in formless dust. When thy walls and turrets, riven By that bolt, to earth are hurled, Ruin's share, in fury driven, Blot thy memory from the world. May a foe, like Gaul's dark legions, Or the swarthy fiends of Hell, Issuing from the infernal regions, Through thy streets at midnight yell. May thy bell, its curfew ringing, Sound as by a demon strook, And each wretch, from slumber springing, Start as if an earthquake shook. Wrapped in gory sheets of lightning, While cursed night-hags ring thy knell, May the arm of vengeance bright'ning O'er thee wave the sword of Hell. May a sudden inundation Rise in many a roaring wave, And with hurried devastation Whelm thy thousands in the grave. When the flood, in fury swelling, Heaves their corpses on the shore, May fell hyæns, madly yelling, Tear their limbs and drink their gore. While starved hounds the moon are baying, Foxes yell, and gaunt wolves howl, May the nighted wanderer straying Startle at the tiger's growl. When the moon, in crimson gleaming, Rises in the gloomy east, Through thy vaults may spectres streaming Seek in yawning graves their feast. Through thy ruined mansions prowling, Where foul spirits love to tread, May lean wolves, and tigers growling, Gnash their teeth and tear the dead. Ismir! land of cursed deceivers, Where the sons of darkness dwell, Hope, the cherub's base bereavers,— Hateful city! fare thee well. DESPONDENCY. I. It is not mirth can ease my heavy woes, Or calm the throbbing tumults of my breast; O, there is naught that can my eyelids close, Or rock my spirits to a peaceful rest! No,—life appears in ebon colors drest, Where'er I turn my woe-worn, aching sight; The morning dawns by every grief opprest, And sombre twilight fades to cheerless night, Bereft of every joy, and void of each delight. If pleasure meet my ever-weeping eye, I see a demon lurking 'neath its flowers; The smile of joy but wakes the heavy sigh, And seems as sad as when the tempest lowers: O, there is nothing in love's rosy bowers Can charm my heart, or blunt grief's poisoned stings! Despair each cup of bliss with misery sours, And o'er the scene a shade of sorrow flings, While ever in my ear the knell of ruin rings. O, how I love to ponder o'er the tomb, And view the clay that wraps my Ellen's form! Sweet to my soul the yew's funereal gloom, And lovely to my sight the coming storm; The smiling flower would but her grave deform, Its gayest charms would give me no delight, No warbling sound my frozen heart could warm; But O how dear the owlet's silent flight, The lonely turtle's wail, the deepest shade of night! Cease, comforter! to pour thy honeyed strain, But whisper sorrow's accents in my ear; O, let me hear the mournful lute complain, And breathe the sound that starts the sudden tear! Can aught that 's gay or cheerful now be dear? Think you, this world will ever please me more? No,—let me rest upon my Ellen's bier: O, let me hasten to that peaceful shore, Where hushed is every storm, and still the tempest's roar! II. O, I could hide me in the darkest cave, And weep till grief my heavy eyelids close; My only solace is the gloomy grave, 'T is there alone my heart can find repose: Life is a dreary wilderness of woes,— No flower of friendship blossoms on the wild, Despair's dark wave in freezing current flows, Where mercy ne'er the orphan heart beguiled, Where pity never wept, and friendship never smiled. What is a friend? A hollow-hearted thing, That smiles and smiles when fortune's look is fair; But when the knell of ruin 'gins to ring, Those lying lips no smiles nor simpers wear. Can I this cruel coldness longer bear? Ah! shall I bend, and scarcely dare complain? No,—for the horrors of the grave I dare; I long that dreary, still abode to gain, Where friends shall ne'er deceive, nor flatterers mock again. To play upon a soul that feels like mine, To raise its hopes, then brush them all away, To charm it with a transient rainbow's shine,— It is a devil's sport, a demon's play. Sport with the soul that's never sad nor gay, But always plods in life's dull, joyless road, That never smiled in pleasure's shining ray, That ne'er was chilled with grief, with passion glowed,— But leave the feeling mind to its own thoughts and God. [Methought 'twas in the desert, at the hour] Methought 'twas in the desert, at the hour Of universal stillness,—the repose Of living nature. With a dead'ning power, The hand of ruin pressed me, and the throes Of parting life seemed passing by;—the grave Had half enthralled me,—o'er my sinking head The dust of everlasting death was thrown. A moment's consciousness,—then being fled, The last weak thought evanished, and the groan Of dying nature ceased. I stood alone, And seemed, how long I know not, in the tomb Of nothing,—thought and consciousness and life Stirred not the deadness of my soul: the womb Of endless night received me, and the strife, Of leaving all we know for ?,was still; The feeling of the present and the past Alike had fled before me, and the will To do what sense refused to do, the vast, O'erwhelming view of ceaseless darkness, all The hopes of better. Then oblivion's pall Seemed drawn around me, and the sullen shroud Of dim forgetfulness, and from the sight Of man I was withdrawn for ever; proud Of standing on an eminence, the height Of genius, I had sunk, and in the night Of gloom interminable my memory lay. How all those golden blossoms, by the blight Of a cold, cankering wind, had passed away! And now not even one form shall come and tell, This was the fatal spot where I arose and fell. THE SUICIDE'S GRAVE. 'T was at the dark, the solemn hour, When midnight throws its gloom around, When the deep-frowning tempests lower, And the shrill-whistling winds resound Along the forest drear, and o'er the lonely grave; When even the courage of the brave Sinks 'neath the pressure of the sullen shade; When the heart's deceitful visions fade,— Visions of bliss by mortals never known, Since virtue from the earth had flown, And anger bared his blood-distilling blade. Lone I wandered by the tomb, Where a wretch, who with his keen-edged knife Loosed the bands that bind the soul to life, And plunged himself in misery's deepest gloom, Slumbered in sleep of death profound,— Which shall ne'er awake, Till the earth's foundations shake, And the last trumpet cleaves the solid ground. A grisly spectre met my staring sight, Dim as the purple meteor of the night, In robe of gory crimson clad; His clotted hands were smeared with red, His eyeballs rolled in frenzy mad, His hollow voice seemed issuing from the dead. “Shun the gloomy thought, that loves to prey On the heart, and eats the soul away, If you dread a living hell, Nor with misery love to dwell.” He said,—and from the tomb Three yells, like hyæns rushing on their prey, Burst their rapid way. It seemed as if the womb Of those eternal realms of woe and pain, Where agonizing demons reign, Had cleaved its iron walls again. Soon he vanished from my eye, In a shower of blood that stained the sky. Dreadful was the sight Of that lonely night, Now in ebon darkness veiled, Now with crimson overspread; So dreadful, that the stoutest heart had quailed, And even the undaunted brave in breathless terror fled. ON MY FATHER'S TOMB. No splendid stone adorns this honored dust, Or points me where my father's relics lie; No beauteous urn, or nicely sculptured bust, Recalls his once-loved image to my eye. But memory still his features can impart, When by his evening fire he sweetly smiled, Or when, with serious look and swelling heart, He kindly checked the wanderings of his child. Ah! there are those, who gratefully can tell How oft his skill detained the parting breath, Composed the tortured bosom's throbbing swell, And smoothed to soft repose the bed of death,— Can tell how oft he eased the racking pain, How oft he cooled the fever's burning glow, And bade fair health revisit once again The hapless child of sickness and of woe. All these can speak,—although no splendid tomb Recount his virtues or adorn his grave, No yew-trees weave their dark, funereal gloom Nor bending willows o'er his relics wave. [See how the floweret blushes in the morn] See how the floweret blushes in the morn,— A thousand colors o'er its bosom play; But soon these hues, that Nature's robe adorn, Rent by the winds, are scattered far away. 'T is thus with beauty, lovely, transient flower,— How soon, alas! its maiden sweetness flies! How soon it fades in life's declining hour, And in the dust a withering rose-bud lies! THE MOURNER. Low sinks the sun beneath the western wave, And twilight deepens in the eastern sky; Pale is the gloom that shades yon lonely grave, Where, twined in death, two lovely sisters lie. Slow wave the boughs above their clay-cold bed, And sighing zephyrs breathe a mournful sound; Hushed is each song,—each beam of day is fled, And chilly dew-drops softly fall around. As fades the gleam of day, the cypress-gloom Weaves its dark curtain o'er the lonely grave; Pale moonbeams sadly glisten on the tomb, As evening mists the weeping marble lave. There bending o'er the turf, where violets shed Their sweetest fragrance on the passing gale, A pensive maiden droops her downcast head, And breathes in angel strains a mourner's wail. Her cheek is white,—no rose is blushing there; The tear of grief has dimmed her sparkling eye; Loose o'er her shoulders falls her flowing hair; Faint from her lips is heard the feeble sigh. Sweet mourner! thou hast lost thy joy,—thy all; No sister now shall meet thee with her smile,— Ne'er shalt thou run at Mary's gentle call, No more shall Laura's voice thy heart beguile. Cold is that lip, where played the smile of love,— Pale is that cheek, which vied the rose of May,— Quenched is that eye, once meekly raised above,— Hushed is that voice,—that soul has flown away. How calm they sleep!—the storm is heard no more; This world shall never bid them weep again; This scene of toil and weariness is o'er, Soothed into Heaven's own peace is every pain. Then let thy tears, dear maid! no longer flow: Wouldst thou confine a soul that seeks the sky? Wouldst thou recall it to a world of woe, And dim with grief that now exulting eye? Nay, dry thy tears,—for see, they bend in love, And drop the dew of pity on thy head; Their love the tenderness that smiles above,— Their tears the crystal drops that angels shed. How sweetly sleep their forms, in death enshrined! And as they loved in this dark vale of woe, So 'neath the heaving clod, in death entwined, And locked in love's embrace, they rest below. They could not part: Heaven saw, with pitying eye, How fond they loved, and joined their souls in death, And kindly bade the sad survivor's sigh Become the dying Christian's parting breath. Slow on the breeze the bending willows wave; That marble monument how coldly fair! Still is that tomb, and dark that lonely grave; But meek Religion smiles serenely there. Still flow thy tears, a brother bids them flow: He, who was once so dear, is now no more; Safe he is rescued from this world of woe, And let us hope has found a happier shore. Far, far from thee he closed his dying eye: No sister's hand was there to give relief; But still Affection o'er him breathed her sigh, And weeping Fondness shed the tears of grief. Friends, who could calm his heart and dry his tear, Around his dying couch in sorrow stood; O'er him that form his bosom held most dear, Low bending, wept affection's purest flood. Soft was the pillow where his parting breath Hung faintly trembling on his lips of snow; Bereft of half its stings, the dart of death Deep in his bosom gave the fatal blow. His eye is dim,—his cheek has lost its glow; Cold is his stiffened hand, and mute his tongue; White as the waving drift of mountain snow, Those lips where sounds of love and sweetness hung. His soul—here darkness spreads her gloomy veil, But Hope, the cherub, points to worlds on high: He may be happy,—cease thy plaintive wail, And wipe the tear of anguish from thy eye. [Slow, through the twilight gloom, Valerio's knell] Slow, through the twilight gloom, Valerio's knell Swells in heart-rending peals along the gale: It summons me to take my last farewell, And with the mourners blend my feeling wail. Gone is my only friend, my dearest mate, With whom, a child, I prattled o'er the plain, Or 'neath the village shade attentive sat, And lisping conned, well pleased, the rural strain; With whom I turned the classic volumes o'er, And drew from Maro's verse a noble flame; With whom in Alma's walls the palm I bore, And keenly struggled for collegiate fame. Dear were the days in mutual kindness spent,— How fair they rise to retrospective view!— When each to each our aid we kindly lent, Unconscious of the hours that o'er us flew. How oft we wept at Orpheus' plaintive tale, How oft, for hapless Dido's slighted love! How often knew the moral muse prevail, And felt our kindling spirits mount above! How often loved the Teian's mellow strain, And Flaccus' happy elegance admired; Or drove with Homer o'er the embattled plain, Our souls ennobled and our bosoms fired! On Ovid's mournful strain we fondly hung, When, banished to Euxina's dreary shore, He swept his careless hand o'er chords ill-strung, And bade his harp his hopeless fate deplore. Warm was that heart which soon is wrapped in clay; For want he always had a boon to give; He took with freest choice fair Virtue's way, And listened to the words that bid us live. Whenever Nature's wonders met his view, With eye effulgent as the star of even, His pious glance serene he upward threw, And traced the chain of causes back to Heaven. Forgive, dear shade! this lisping of thy praise: Thou little need'st the plaudits of thy friend; But deign, when clothed in glory's cloudless blaze, A guardian angel o'er my form to bend. [Hard is the Poet's fate,—but more severe] Hard is the Poet's fate,—but more severe To luckless bard, who muses here, the doom; Long he may shed the ineffectual tear, Then starve, and sink unnoticed to the tomb. What though his genius burned with dazzling light, And vied with those who graced imperial Rome? Wealth he neglected, and the heedless wight Must seek in bridewell or the grave his home. But if we spurn the living, shall the dead Ne'er claim from us the tribute of a sigh? Taste by exotic streams alone is fed,— Each tongue is mute, and every cheek is dry. We might, when years have rolled around his tomb, Should foreign critics deign to crown his bust, Or should their praise his withering bays illume, Drop one scant tear upon the Poet's dust. Some son of wealth, who thinks he loves the Muse, May yield a stinted tribute to his fame, And, 'neath the shelter of low-bending yews, Erect a wooden altar to his name. Shame on my country!—shall ignoble gain Be all that charms or wakes the voice of praise? O, wilt thou never hear the Poet's strain, And weave for him Columbia's native bays? [The last blue hill is fading in the sky] The last blue hill is fading in the sky, The shores are melting in the distant wave; 'T is there thy lovely woods and meadows lie, Land of my birth, my home, my father's grave But fate commands me, and I now must go, And leave my friends and parent all behind; Beneath my feet the waves of ocean flow, And o'er them bounds the ship before the wind. Land of my boyish days! and must we part? Must all thy fond endearments charm no more? Must I forego that ecstasy of heart I felt with friends so often on thy shore? The ocean foams before me,—there I go. Who knows I ever shall return again? Who knows what gloomy scenes of deepest woe Await me far—far distant o'er the main? But I must go,—my land has bid me fly, The sword of justice drives me o'er the wave. Yes, I must go, in foreign lands to die, And find, with strangers cold, a tearless grave. How gush my tears,—how throbs my fevered brain, To think my folly drove me from that shore! O, I shall never sleep in peace again! Pleasure shall dawn and mercy smile no more. My prospects—O how fair! the morning sun Ne'er shone more lovely on a world in bloom; But ere I left the goal my race was done, My scenes of pleasure changed to scenes of gloom. Justice pursues me,—I must leave that shore, And trust my hopeless fortune to the wave; O how I long, when life shall all be o'er— O how I long to rest me in the grave! SONNETS. I. THE ROSE-BUSH. I would not rob that rose-bush of a flower,— No! not for all the charms of Mary's smile, Although she begged the blooming gift the while With all a lovely woman's softening power: No! for that glowing shrub at morning's hour, While bending o'er the bank of yonder isle, Can with its spangled gems my soul beguile, Such soothing influence hath a dewy flower. And, Mary, when I see thee gently bending O'er yonder monument, where Laura lies, Where marble-snow and crimson blooms are blending, Methinks I see an angel in thine eyes, While heavenly tears, in crystal drops descending, Tell of our anguish when a sister dies. II. THE BOWER. Retreat of Innocence! receive my form,— The form of one who wishes for repose, And asks a pillow, where his eyes may close,— Where he may slumber safe from earthly harm: And oh! within thy shade, where every charm Of Nature wantons on the dewy rose, Where sweetest music on the zephyr flows, E'en now I feel my chilly heart grow warm: Sure angels might repose in such a bower, No stain of earth might dim their purity; Here slumbering at the even's quiet hour, The dew of innocence might o'er them lie, While heavenly harps a seraph strain might pour, And raise the listener's soul to ecstasy. III. THE EYELID. Soft, velvet lid, that shades the living spring Whence flows the stream of sensibility,— Where meek-eyed loves in gentle ambush lie, And graces flutter round on glittering wing! Why o'er that sparkling fount thy curtain fling? Why hide the lustre of that ebon eye, Where Sylphs, on filmy pinions, hover nigh, And Fairies trip around in frolic ring? Like morning dew-drops on a bed of roses, Serenely shines my loved Maria's tear, When on that orb of light the drop reposes, Or slowly steals along the sable bier, And as her strain of sorrow sweetly closes, There seems an angel breathing in my ear. [IV. Soft heaving wave, whose pure translucency] Soft heaving wave, whose pure translucency Swells on the bosom of the placid lake, And as it slowly swells, the watery flake Plays on the snowy pebble gracefully, While breathes around fair Nature's minstrelsy, And morning zephyrs in the willows wake, And from the boughs the showery moisture shake, And winding riv'lets murmur tunefully: How sweet upon the mossy bank to lie, And view the shining trout that darts below, While drowsy slumber hovers o'er my eye, And all its poppy dews around me flow, While through the quivering leaves the breezes sigh, And round my pillow whisper mournfully! V. SPRING. Winter has gone, and Spring returns again: The lonely thrush is singing by the rill, The lively robin warbles on the hill, And blue-birds flutter o'er the flowery plain, And, as they flutter, breathe a cheerful strain; While homelier sounds the budding scenery fill,— The tinkling shepherd-bell, the rattling mill, And the faint rolling of the distant wain; And lovely is the lay the milkmaid sings, As 'neath the elm she fills her snowy pail, And sweet the tolling bell, that slowly rings, The softly breathing flute within the vale, While zephyrs hover round on downy wings, And the rapt Poet strikes his quivering strings. VI. TO SLEEP. Hail, universal friend! whose gentle hand Showers o'er our heavy eyes thy cooling dew, And closes for a time the anxious view Of past existence. Thou, with mighty wand, Above the tortured couch art seen to stand, And lay the brain's delirious rage at rest, And ease the heart by sorrow's weight opprest. All-conquering power! to whose supreme command All living nature bows,—whose deep control O'ermasters mightiest monarchs,—calm and still Thou stealest on the sage's unfleshed soul, And bendest pride and glory to thy will: Thy whispered voices harmonize the whole, And all beneath thy sway in peaceful current roll. VII. TO THE GRAVE. There is a couch, whereon we all must lie; There is a pillow, where the burning thought Will find the oblivious ease it long has sought, And memory will close her wakeful eye, And conscience spread her vulture wings, and fly To find on Caucasus another prey, Where she may pounce and pounce, from day to day, The heart that longs for death, but will not die; And there forgetfulness has drawn around Her raven curtain, and her hand has sealed The inflamed eye of sorrow, and has bound The venomed gash of early wrong, and healed The spirit's every malady; for deep We fall in dreamless, unawakening sleep. [VIII. 'T is not the future dread that makes me shun] 'T is not the future dread that makes me shun The end of all the living,—not the fear Of that which thunders in the coward's ear, And drives him to his fancied hell,—not one Of those the hypocrite can work upon, Who plays with childish, female weakness:—No, There is no darker world where I can go, And all that justice can inflict is done: But life will linger even when hope has flown, And we will cling to all that once had power To charm us, soothe us, bless us, and the hour Of early, unstained passion—that alone Comes like a flash of light across the heart, From whose imagined heaven we cannot, will not part. [IX. We think of what we might have been: the stream] We think of what we might have been: the stream Was crystal at its fountain,—though it flowed Without that strong, deep current, still it glowed Beneath a brighter sky, and gay the beam Played on its dancing waters, as we dream In sunny climes of fairy-land, where blows In never-fading hues the living rose, Where myrtles shed their fragrance, and we seem, Such is the luxury of feeling there, The kindling energy our souls inhale, Ourselves a portion of the balmy air,— So flowed the stream of life, as through the vale It threw its unstained waters from the spring, And with its freshness wet the zephyr's silent wing. But while the scanty rill stole through the glen In peaceful playfulness, it chanced to meet The turbid torrent of the wide world; beat By rushing floods, its shores re-echoed; then In its devouring vortex sucked, again To be no more the pure, unmingled stream, We hurried down the steep, which most men deem The only path to pleasure, but the den Lies at the bottom, where Remorse has built Her iron walls, wherein the boiling surge, Whirled round and round with all the rage of guilt, The ever-rushing past will madly urge; For in the heart where sense and passion dwell, Erelong will heave the flood of such a restless hell. But there are some more silent, calm, and slow; Through temperate climes they take their steady way; Their wave scarce ruffled by the ripple's play, Enlarging through the wide, rich plain they flow, While brooks on brooks uniting swell it so, At length it rolls a river broad and deep; In calmest light the tranquil waters sleep, And there in gallant trim proud vessels go, And moving like a swan along the tide, With cleaving prow, and wide-extended wing, And oary arms, the bounding wave they ride, And as their canvas to the gale they fling, In stately march they walk the liquid plain, And down the widening stream plough to the deep blue main, The boundless hall of ocean:—Life the shore, The only shore, it spreads and spreads for ever, And though the bark sail onward, it can never Traverse the unlimited expanse,—its floor Inlaid with blue and green and gold, as rise Its lifted waves, its canopy the skies, The ever-glowing sun its lamp, the roar Of seas its music, and the sun-lit sparkle Of curling foam, the phosphorescent glow That flashes when at night the waters darkle, The pearls and gems and sands and ores that strow Its pavement,—'t is the home of majesty, The palace and the shrine, where dwells eternity. [X. I too have seen thy ever-pouring flood] I too have seen thy ever-pouring flood, Mightiest of cataracts, Niagara! Have seen thy restless waters rush away, And on thy beetling rock alone have stood, And seen the morning sunbeams paint thy spray, And countless rainbows on thy light mist play; And I have walked along thy field of blood, Whereon the free invaders stood at bay, And, mantled in the shadow of the night, Infuriate warriors wrestled in the fight, The pale moon weeping o'er the mortal fray; And I have gazed, from Queenston's hallowed height, On river, lake, and plain, in sunset bright, Gilt streams, dark woods, blue waves in sweet array: And hither, as the years shall roll away, The pilgrim of our land shall fondly hie, And here the tribute of his heart shall pay, And kneel before the shrine of God and liberty. [XI. My hand is clasped upon my burning brow] Myhand is clasped upon my burning brow, And pressed to ease the tortures of my brain; I seek to cool my parched thirst, but in vain, The unpitying fiend no respite will allow,— My life consumes within me with a slow, Delirious fever,—in a heavy chain Depression fetters all my hopes,—again No days in love and innocence shall flow. We might have been,—that is the maddening thought Which gnaws my heart untiring,—I have thrown The jewel of my life away:—I sought Bliss high and perfect; but the prize has flown, And I must grope in darkness, till I fall, And slumber in the grave that shrouds my being's all. XII. TO THE PIANO. Sweet instrument, whose mellow voice is flowing, From yonder silken canopy, in waves Canorous, like the hidden stream that laves Its grassy banks, where eglantines are blowing, And, arching o'er the waters, deeply glowing; And as the music murmurs in my ear, The days of long-lost happiness appear, When, early life its dearest gifts bestowing, I glided smoothly down the sunny stream, And dreaming eyed the oft-reflected beam, That o'er the crisping waters gayly sparkled, And breathed the scent of blossoms from the bank, Where bloomy shrubs the flowing crystal drank; And where beneath the plane its bosom darkled, I rested on my oar, and heard a sound, Tender and sweetly modulate, that filled The thicket with its echoes, far around Unnumbered voices whispered from the wild, The zephyr drooped his wings, the clear wave smiled, And nature seemed as by enchantment thrilled. There was a form, who breathed that melting tone; She sat beneath the branches, and she threw Her fairy fingers o'er her keys, and drew The essence of their melody;—alone She sat, and seemed enamored of her strain, And now she eyed her notes, and then again Lifted her brow to heaven;—and O what pure, Exalted harmony breathed from that face, The living seat of symmetry and grace! I gazed, and from that kindling fountain bore A draught of love admiring, which no more Can fail, but in perennial flow endure. I hear thy voice, sweet instrument! and then This fairy vision comes, and o'er me throws The mantle of its magic, and again I hear the mellow tone, that from her sweet lip flows. THE INTERLUDES OF TASSO'S AMINTA. I. Yes, I am he, who, on the sounding shore Of that lone island, to the wondrous man Who o'er the sea his fated exile ran, So many varying forms and features wore; By me was found the art to change the scene Of the life-mocking theatre, when night Holds such a kindling mirror to the sight, That things seem gay and bright, which else were mean: And then how many images are seen, All pure and sweet and beautiful, light shades Of raptured youths, and coy, retiring maids! And when the night is silent and serene, And throws her star-lit canopy around, I show the scenic pomp, the elastic bound Of merry revellers, while no rude throng Disturbs the harmony of heart and song II. Ye sacred laws of love, by Nature given,— Ye holy chains, where purest constancy And warm desire are blent, like hues of heaven Dissolving in Aurora's brilliancy, Whose links, of kindred thoughts and feelings woven, No other hand but death's can rend away, By all the tender cares of marriage proven, Grow easier and dearer day by day,— Sweet yoke, delightful burden! O how sweet And how delightful on the unequal way, Where thorns and roses meet, thy gentle sway, O Love! by whom two hearts together beat, Two souls are kindled in one mutual flame, And every thought, wish, feeling, is the same, And till the last and bitter parting come Time flows on in one bright, unruffled stream. Thou art the kindling and consoling beam Of life for ever hastening to the tomb, Tired nature's sweet, restoring anodyne;— What other power, like thee, can make our souls divine? III. Yes, we are gods, and in the blue serene Of ever-during heaven, among the gems That deck the night, the crystal diadems Of sainted souls, on a celestial scene, We sport in mingled dances, where the green Of Spring of ever flourishes, her flowers Are always bright and balmy, and her showers Of dropping nectar light their pearly sheen. Such high adventure, such immortal grace, We in this mimic school of life display, And here the world's best imagery we trace, And sport in playful dance the hours away,— And here, at night, along the lighted hall, Where burning cressets emulate the day, And harmony's soft flutes and citterns play, Shepherds and nymphs, in youth and beauty gay, In blended choirs lead round the flying ball. IV. Farewell! 't is now the hour of soft repose, Ye pensive lovers and ye ladies fair! Now to your silent couch of sleep repair; Now night with showering hand her poppies strows, And rains her violets;—now the dew-steeped rose Hangs faintly drooping, for the day is done, And mountain peaks with the departing sun Are gayly glowing. Now your eyelids close; But if your thoughts will wake, and fancy paint Her airy hues of ecstasy, may love, Wakeful or dreaming, all your cares remove, Nor night nor morning hear your sad complaint. Our pastoral is ended, now adieu! And may the young God still be kind to you. ANACREONTIC. ?? ????? ?? ??? ??????. Anac. Od. E. Now blend the breathing roses Of love with Dionusos; Now bind the fair-leafed roses Around your dripping temples, And, laughing, drain the goblet That foams with brimming nectar. O rose! the sweetest blossom, Of spring the fairest flower, O rose! the joy of heaven. The god of love, with roses His yellow locks adorning, Dances with the hours and graces. Then crown my head with roses, For, by thy festive temple, I tune my harp, Lyæus! And wreathed with rosy garlands I dance among the maidens. [O for a mantling bower hung by the loaded vine] “Quis multa gracilis te puer in rosa.”— Hor. L. I. 5. O for a mantling bower hung by the loaded vine, Through whose quivering leaves shines the moon's mellow light, Sunk on pillowy roses, Silent to muse all the night away! O for a soft hour at eve, with her my heart adores! O for that union of souls, where thought to thought responds, And our harmonized feelings Blended may rise on the winds to heaven. O for that language of looks, where eye to eye speaks love, Where smile answers to smile, and tear is shed for tear, Where our kindling glances Tell all the wishes that burn within! O for those days that are gone, when one heart beat with mine, When she smiled as we met, wept her soul's tribute at leaving me, And with seeming devotion Hung on the lessons I loved to give. Days! ye were lovely to me, brightest I ever knew; Brighter ye still might have been, had not a cloud from hell, Over my ill-fated fortunes Hung, till the light of my soul was gone. Backward I look on a dream checkered with bright and dark; Youth swelled with hope, fame-enthralled, health, peace, and innocence, And thy Elysian bowers, Love, life's dearest and sweetest charm. Such were the lights; but the shades—fear and despondency, Hopes blighted, health lost, neglect, folly, and indolence, Till despair wrapped her raven pall Round my torn heart to eternity. Fairest and purest and best,—fair as the world in bloom, Pure as the clear mountain spring, bright as the souls in heaven,— Such my fancy believes thee, Such—but no efforts can make thee mine. Life without thee is a waste, with thee a paradise; Never on earth can we meet,—O, can we meet in heaven? We have parted for ever,— Thine be the joy, mine the wretchedness. Tossed like a ship on the sea, mast broke and rudder gone, Sorrow and madness behind, darkness and death before, Live a few moments in agony, Then be as though I had never been. [High they raised the mast, and spread the white sail to the zephyr] ????? ?? ????????? ?????? ??????? ???????? ?????? ?????????. Homer, Odyss. II. 424. High they raised the mast, and spread the white sail to the zephyr, Wide before the wind the bellying canvas yielded, Round the gliding keel roared loud the purple billow, Over the foaming waves the swift-flying vessel bounded, She flew, like a hawk, through the sea, and the shores drew nearer and nearer, The foam curled round the prow as the wind impelled her onward, Through the silent night she sailed, till morning lit the mountains. [The thirsty fields a robe of sadness wear] “Aret ager, vitio moriens sitit aeris herba.”— Virgil, Ecl. VII. 57. The thirsty fields a robe of sadness wear, And the grass withers in the sultry air; On the fair hillocks, where the swains recline, The yellow leaf drops from the parched vine: Let Phyllis come, the groves are green again, And the dark clouds pour down reviving rain; Smiles every meadow, blooms each lovely flower, And the pleased songsters hail the genial shower. The dark-green poplar whispers o'er the rills, And the vine blushes on the sunny hills; The beauteous myrtle trembles o'er the wave, The laurel shades the cool, sequestered cave: But while my Phyllis loves the hazel grove The lowly hazel I shall ever love. The lofty ash is fairest in the woods, The trembling aspen o'er the crystal floods, In flowery gardens waves the whispering pine, The fir looks fair where towering hills decline; But when, my Lycidas, you once return, When for your absence I shall cease to mourn, The ash shall yield to you among the woods, And aspen trembling o'er the crystal floods. [Here mossy fountains pour their cooling wave] “Hic gelidi fontes.”— Ecl. X. 42. Here mossy fountains pour their cooling wave, And quiet streams their pebbly borders lave, Here thickest shades inweave a lovely gloom And blushing flowerets shed a sweet perfume, Here, dear Nerine, we can spend each day, And here can wear our cheerful lives away. Happy old man! here, 'mid your well-known streams “Fortunate senex, hic inter flumina nota.”— Ecl. I. 52. Happy old man! here, 'mid your well-known streams And sacred fountains, you may long enjoy The quiet coolness of the solemn shade. There o'er the hedge, that bounds your narrow field, The bees, that wanton on the willow's bloom, Shall, by their hum, invite you to repose: There, 'neath the brow of yonder lofty cliff, The pruner's voice shall sing aloud to heaven: Meanwhile, amid the still and gloomy grove, The hoarse wood-pigeons, thy delight, shall coo, And high amid the elm's aerial boughs The lonely turtle pour her ceaseless moan. [I. Thou, who erst on Ætna's top] [The following were written in imitation of the irregular Greek poems of Simmias, the Rhodian. They can only be considered as trifles, whose sole merit must rest in their poetical language and rhythm. I have not chosen to give them in printing their original form, but merely to arrange them in an irregular blank measure.] Thou, who erst on Ætna's top, In dreaming fancy, sat, And looked on wide Sicania's plains, Adorned with fruits and flocks and golden grain, Where Ceres, Flora, Pan, in mingled dance combined, Led on the jocund hours to music's sweetest breath: And as the sun at height of noon, From heaven's blue canopy, effused His living radiance o'er the earth, Shining on mountains capped with snow and ice, Or blackened with a waving wilderness Of forests, that for ages long had braved The shock of tempests and the war of winds, When rushing from the dark Liparian caves they fly, And sweep o'er land and sea, Upturning from its lowest bed, In curling foam, old Ocean's rolling waves; Glittering on sunny rocks and hills, Where purple vineyards teem with nectared juice, the fount of joy, On hillocks sweet with thyme and dittany, Where Hybla's murmuring bees, from laughing flowers, Ambrosia cull, like molten gold in hue, Translucent as the crystal wave, That, in Ortygia's sea-surrounded isle, From Arethusa wells; Glowing on plains perfumed with roses, where the shepherd's flute An amorous descant warbled, while the bleat of flocks And low of herds came floating on the wind; And pouring all its kindling power On meadows, where the reed Shook and snowy lilies bloomed. [II. The cypress, in its dark funereal dress] The cypress, in its dark funereal dress, Hangs o'er the sacred tomb where Virgil lies, And as the evening breeze begins to curl The golden waves that lave the Baian shores, And heave in gurgling tides their crest of foam, Kissing the polished shells and snowy sands, A strain of sorrow seems to breathe From those low-bending boughs, the whispering wind Wakes every leaf to music, and the tree becomes a harmony Of myriad voices, as if Heaven's whole choir, Cherub and Seraph, on their harps of gold, Should pour a dirge for man's unhappy fall, And weep that powers, which took in Heaven The kindling spark of life, Should lose that light and die. The mind is bound to sense, And if the reins of sense Are loosed in youth's impetuous hour, Without a skilful hand to check or guide, Like full-fed, fiery coursers bursting from the goal They rush, and with them hurry on the mind, the charioteer: Then Reason's voice is heard in vain, Wild as the tempest-winds they fly, Obscured by dust, and bathed in foam, They burst away, they know not whither. Death Sits on his storm-cloud, draws his dart, and bends his bow; The arrow flies with awful twang,— It leaves the body spent, but kills the mind; And souls, that might have soared aloft and sung, Like him who sleeps within this hallowed cave, Lose all their fire, and sink to earth, in dust and darkness lost. [III. The clouds are black in heaven, the roar of winds] The clouds are black in heaven, the roar of winds Is heard among the tall, aspiring tops Of hoary oaks, that wave on Gargarus, And proudly heave their giant arms. These oaks have stood unhurt, unmoved, The storms of ages as they rolled: No tempest broke their boughs, No lightning scathed their trunks. They stand in mockery against the winds, And laugh the fury of the storm to scorn; But man, poor feeble man, can lay Their honors in the dust; By constant toil he rules. But man, to rule, must rule himself, Or all his toil is vain. In life's first dawn he needs The watchful care of friends. The flower that early blooms, Must from the chilly winds Be shielded, or it droops and dies; The tender plant of childhood needs that care,— It takes each form you give; the parent's hand Can, if the task with life begin, Train it as easily To virtue as to vice; But if you let it shoot luxuriant, wild, Or train it up to vice in life's weak dawn, It wastes its early strength for naught, And when the time of fruit arrives, you come And find its branches withered, scorched, and bare. THE GOBLET. Where gay Falernum lifts its sunny brow O'er wide Campania's sea of bending corn, I rose and shook my tendrils to the gale, And glowed with living purple and gold. How rich, to see the teeming clusters Droop beneath their nectared load, To inhale the airs of fragrance, As the wanton wind Loaded his wings with dewy sweetness, culled The choicest perfumes that I shed, And, whispering o'er the banks Of blossoms, gave them richer sweets! Fluttering zephyrs hovered round me, Kissed my purple, frosted coat, And tinged their lips with honey. Dews Wet my clusters, till themselves Imbibed my sweets, and then exhaled In fragrant mist away. Pressed, and refined by time, I stand Within the crystal goblet, while a light Of purest amber floats around and sheds a mellow beam, As if a cloud of clustering roses Crossed the sun and crimsoned all the earth. [Expand your snowy wings, ye swans of Helicon] Expand your snowy wings, ye swans of Helicon! And bear me to some paradise On India's verdant mountains, or on Iran's plains: Lay me beneath the spreading palm, That heaves its polished shaft aloft, and waves Its capital of verdure; flowers that glow Like morning's gay effulgence, fruits that hang Their purple clusters, in communion blent, Mingle their beauty and their sweetness;—gales Breathe from the lovely union, fragrance-laden, And cheer for many a league the desert round, As budding, blooming, ripening, and mature, In soft accordance pensilely they droop:— The camel scents the wind,—he knows the spring Of living coolness bubbles where it loads Its wings with odors, and at once he starts And scours the dazzling plain:—O, lay me there, And, hovering over, pour your dying notes, The dirge of one who sang and shone, a child, And sunk at manhood in the dust, despised. [How happy is the pure, good man, whose life] How happy is the pure, good man, whose life Was always good, who in the tender years Of childhood, and the trying time of youth, Was shielded by a kind parental hand! No stain deforms the brightness of his soul, Only those specks of frail humanity, Which almost need the microscopic eye To trace their being. As the river rolls Pure and unsullied o'er its sandy bed In gentle agitation, that its waves Sink not in silent stagnancy, his life Passes in peaceful industry its round. He rises with the lark, and like that bird, Who sings her morning melody aloft Amid the blue of heaven, he pours his voice To God in secret prayer: “Father in Heaven! Omnipotent, eternal! ere the world Rose, at thy bidding, from the formless void, Blest in thy own essential good, thou liv'dst, With space thy home, eternity thy day. Before the Sun of Being rose, when night And chaos brooded o'er the seeds of things, Thy spirit wandered through the black abyss, And o'er the boundless waste of waters moved. The word went forth,—Confusion's voice was still. At once from darkness, light and form and life, And harmony and beauty, love and joy, And melody and sweetness rose and filled Creation with the wonders of thy power. How sprang the infant sun from ocean's bed, And glowed and glittered o'er its tossing waves! How all the effulgent company of stars, Blent in a choir of perfect harmony, Lifted their voices in the arch of heaven, And sang the birth of Being! how the moon, Mantled in paler lustre, filled her orb With borrowed beams, and thro' the dark-blue sky, Dispensing love, her nightly journey ran! How from its calm, the yet untainted air, Waked by the morning, swept the teeming earth In gentle gales and zephyrs bland, and shook The vocal forest, and the glassy plain Of ocean curled with billows! Then no storm, Pregnant with the munitions of thy wrath, Hung frowning on the mountains, black as night, And grim as terror, waiting for thy voice To unfold its lurid skirts, and onward move To do thy vengeance. Then the sky was clear, No fleecy vapor dimmed its purity, Gay laughed the sun amid its fields of blue, And peace and health and pleasure cheered the world. No stagnant marsh nor festering swamp sent up Its venomed mists and baleful fogs, the dews, Drawn by the sun from living plants, dropped free From all infection,—then no pestilence Lifted its hydra-head, and through the streets Of cities, conscience-struck, replete with vice, And misery and filth, its fruit, stalked on Exhaling death,—no battle squared its front, To feed its ravening maw with human blood,— No prison spread its gates, to swallow up And bury in its hidden gloom the wretch Who dared to violate thy holy law, And lift against society his hand; Nor had the grave its all-devouring jaws Disclosed, the couch where man must lay his head, And sleep with rank corruption and the worm. “All then was pure; the blue sky overhead Transparent opened to the farthest ken Of human vision, like a hollow sphere Of crystal, closing all creation in. The star of day, a radiant jewel set In that unblemished azure, to the eye Insufferably brilliant, from the east Impurpled, as the dewy morning rose And wrung the tears, that night wept, from her hair, To the midway throne, whereon he sits at noon And pours his most effulgent effluence down, And thence descending to the western wave, Or forest ridge, that tosses like a sea Its living billows, as a conqueror, marched,— Thy purest spark, vicegerent of thy love. That orb has dipped his brightness in the stream Of ocean, and his last rays on the clouds Have painted evening's tapestry, wherewith She curtains round her canopy with gold And purple, ruby and emerald and blue: Then night ascends her car,—her plumy steeds, Like birds nocturnal, through the drowsy air, Fly silently and slow; she waves her wand, And evening's many-colored veil is gone; The sky puts off its soft cerulean robe, And decks itself in sable livery, Whereon innumerous gems of starry gold Shine, with their bright eyes twinkling, as a train, Encircling yon fair light, that charms the west, Following the set of sun, or in the east, Gay Phosphor, bringing on his orient beams. Thus one unvaried mantle hid the face Of earth from every eye, and blended all The charms of hill and valley, bush and tree, River and fountain, in one common shade: Until the queen of heaven, from the deep, Emerged, and blushing through the fiery zone Of the low-hanging vapor, by her light Enkindled, slowly onward held her way, Walking in regal majesty, until She reached the clear meridian,—there she hung, An orb of purest silver, with the shades Of sea and mountain checkered, as with pearls Laid glittering on a snowy satin ground; Ascending there, she hung a milder sun, And poured her borrowed brightness o'er the face Of this round earth, that rolls self-poised thro' space, And takes its annual journey round the sun, For ever balanced in its orbit. Night, By this illumined, silvered o'er her brow; And straightway, rising from a formless waste, Smiled hill and forest, meadow, vale, and stream, And many a white tent, where the shepherd lies Enwrapped in downy slumber, many a fold, Where flocks and herds concoct the feed of day, And many a loaded bower with purple hung, And many a harvest field, that called the swain To put his sickle forth and reap its gold. “The unseeded earth was bare,—its towering rocks And sparkling sands, its snowy chalks and clays Imbrowned, were void of vegetation, when The word went forth, ‘Let herb and tree appear.’ As by the touch of some magician's wand, Fair palaces, bright domes, and gardens gay With all the wealth of art and nature, rise, And occupy the cheerless desert,—Life, In all its countless forms of plant, arose, And in its mantle robed the barren earth. The Cedar sprang on Lebanon, the Fir Waved on the rocks of Norway, whispering Pines, Towering on Alpine summits, widely spread Their feathered umbrage, dancing to the gale And murmuring with the zephyr; o'er the plains Of sterile sand, along the southern shores Of tideless Baltic, or the long-drawn coast, By which the ocean torrent rushes, plains Beneath a tropic sun, like Zara, bare, The home of desolation,—here by dews, From sea and lake and neighboring mountain, clad With dark, perennial foliage, like the shade Funereal, that enwraps the sepulchre Of Turk and Persian in an awful gloom,— There o'er the dry, unwatered ridge, that swells Round as the ocean wave that erst involved The forest in its waters, and the sand, Now filled with shells and corals, made its bed,— The pitch-tree lifts her spiry head, with cones In russet mantled, when the north-wind blows, Black at a distance, as the mourning pall, When all the world is gay with new-born life, And mantled in a sea-blue covering at The coming on of winter, taking on Her young leaves, when deciduous foliage drops And strows the ground it shaded, in the day Of general mourning to the field and grove, Smiling in tears to see herself renewed, When Death is riding round her. Where the streams And fountains send their tribute, in the vale Scooped out among the hillocks, like a bowl, And o'er the boundless plain, low-lying, drenched By torrent rains, the cypress weaves its dusk, Dank canopy, that in its mantle shrouds The stagnant flood teeming with life below. Ah! who would venture through those boundless fens, O'er which the tree of ages frowns, bowed down With mossy tresses, spangled o'er with flowers, Like gay Anacreon in his rosy wreath? There grenadillas ramble o'er the boughs, Laden with blue and crimson blossoms, hung With tempting fruits, like golden apples, which Stole on the virgin's heart and conquered her: Above 't is beauty, and below green sedge And spiry reeds and purpled flags conceal The hideous forms that batten there, the snake, Who twines his jetty folds of giant length, And throws around his fascinating eye Of living glow, to draw the heedless prey Within his crushing coils. The wanderer's foot Disturbs a reedy tuft; the rustling grass Awakes the serpent, who, with tooth of fire, Lurks in the thicket,—hark! the warning sound, The death-announcing rattle sings and bids The invader fly his danger,—adders hiss, And lizards roar, unseen destroyers wait To instil their poison, with a living wall Of separation cutting from the world These sweltering holds, wherein is found the home Of reptiles, plagues, and pestilence and death: But from their watery stores the sun draws up Dews, mists, and clouds, that quench the thirsty sands And clothe what else had been one sparkling waste In a wide sea of never-dying green.” Thus pass the moments by, till night draws on; At rest with all the world, calm in himself, Conscious of rectitude and purity, He lays him down upon his homely couch; Peace, on her dove-wings, hovers o'er his head And fans his pillow; through the slumbrous night Fair dreams of calm oblivion soothe his soul; No muttered groan, no sudden shriek, nor start, Disturb his quiet, but his sleep is sweet, And gives him kind refreshment till the morn. [We have a body,—and its clamorous calls] We have a body,—and its clamorous calls And appetites importunate demand The service of our nobler part, the soul. O, how I long to throw this garment off, Which burdens me with flesh, which dims the light That else had shone so brilliantly, and moved With such a lofty grandeur through the fields Of intellect and fancy! Had not sense Inthralled me in my childhood, ere the bud Had opened to the influence of Heaven And hope and love and beauty, had no worm Crept to the core, and nested and consumed The heart within, while all without was fair, Until it slowly withered, and the bloom Of youth was changed to paleness, where the hand Of death had set its seal, and ruin traced Its mark indelible, I now had walked With front erect beneath the argent shield Of conscious rectitude, despising wealth And pomp and power and pride, and trampling down Vice, though she came in all the outward charms Of paradisal houris, or in folds Alluring twined herself around, and fawned With leering eye, and called with flattering tongue. [Youth sees the world before him, and the path] Youth sees the world before him, and the path Of sin how fair, hedged in by every sweet That flowers can breathe, or melting fruits distil; For ever winding in its blossomed maze, It meets the eye with pleasures ever new; It leads to luscious gardens, snowy beds Of lilies, heaps of roses, citron shades, That breathe alluring fragrance, cool retreats Beneath o'erarching vines, and lonely grots, Where nectared fountains bubble, amber streams Of kindling waters murmur, on whose banks Couches of matted grass and scented bloom Invite to slumber; music flows around, The flute soft-warbling, and the violin, That calls the dance, and wakes the revelry Of jolly hearts, who float like bubbles down The wave of being; myrtle thickets hide The haunts of lawless love, where whispered sighs And tittering voices through the night are heard, And every deed of dallying wantonness Conceived and done; fair women, like the forms Who spread their arms to meet the warm embrace Of saints, who dwell beneath the golden groves Of Paradise, as Eastern fables tell, Call to illusive pleasures. How the form Mantled in gauzy drapery, which shows Each fair-turned limb and rounded muscle, steeps The soul in dreams voluptuous! how the face, Whereon a thousand seeming graces sit, Where the eye shines in ebon brightness, dark, Insufferably dark, and with its lure In fascination chains the gazer, till She come and clasp her prey, or, dyed in blue Of liquid softness, rolls its languid look, And often throwing round the artful leer, Turns from the meeting eye and sinks abashed! The cheek for ever dimpling with the play Of life's red current, now the crimson stream Departing leaves it just incarnardined, And melting into milky softness, then The blush calls all the living lustre forth, And like a full-blown rose it kindling swells. Such is her path of roses; but its end Is sickness, sorrow, shame, despair, and death. [The stream of life that flowed on Calvary] The stream of life that flowed on Calvary May yet have power to wash away my stains, And leave my suffering spirit pure in Heaven. She must be there, such innocence and grace, Such cherub mildness, must find there its home. O, had I never wandered in my youth, Had but the living wave flowed onward pure, As when it left its fountain, I might now Mingle my hopes and happiness with hers. But this can never be: the ills of life Have thrown a separating gulf between, Impassable, till I shall launch my bark Upon the sea of dark futurity, And steer my course for Heaven, those happy shores, That bloom with love eternal; there our souls May mingling meet, and never part again. THE DRAMA. Where is the light that shed its holy beam And fired the bard by Avon's silver stream, When Nature threw her mantle o'er her child And woke his infant voice to wood-notes wild, Bathed in her kindling flood his ardent soul, And bade his heavenward eye in frenzy roll,— That falcon eye which looked creation through, From earth to heaven in quick conception flew, Left all the fainter pinions far behind, And read at one wide glance th' expanded mind, Knew every spring and passion of the heart, And rivalled Greece in all the pride of art? Where is that daring, strong, gigantic age, The glorious morning of the English stage, When Genius took a bold and lofty flight, And burst, all dazzling, from her Gothic night? O, where are now those souls, that seemed on fire And burning with a poet's wild desire, Who saw and keenly loved the grand and fair, And bodied forth their forms of viewless air? O, where are now those thoughts and words of flame, That shine most brightly on the roll of fame, Those passion-speaking sounds, which fire and thrill, And bind, as with a magic chain, the will, Those streams of native eloquence, that flow Like torrents rushing to the vales below, Pouring their white floods down the mountain's height, And sparkling in the blaze of solar light? Is Genius dead? shall fancy wake no more? Are all the triumphs of our drama o'er? Is there no infant Shakespeare, who would spring, And soar, with upward breast and daring wing,— Who gnaws with restless tooth his galling chain, And toils for freedom, toils and strives in vain,— Who looks on glory with untiring eyes, Who would be great, but cannot, dare not rise? Awake, ye sons of poesy! awake, And, with determined grasp, your fetters break; Against the painted swarms of fashion dare, And from their locks her perfumed garlands tear, Indignant sweep her cobweb strains away, And hush the love-sick warblers of the day: Dare with a frown to front this downward age, And drive melodious weakness from the stage, And once more seating Nature on her throne, There bid her reign for ever and alone, And from her full, exhaustless fountain roll The words that kindle and exalt the soul. Where, throned on Alps, eternal winter reigns, And Freedom wanders through her rude domains, A race of demigods she loves to breed, And with the bitter bread of hunger feed; Till, hardy as the rocks that round them rise, And stainless as their own unclouded skies, Her strong-nerved sons, by want and labor nursed, Like giants from those hard-bound mountains burst, Fierce as the tiger, when he stands at bay, And wild as gaunt wolves rushing on their prey; Cruel as hyæns, when they rend the grave, And on the red field tear the slaughtered brave: Thus, in their new-waked might, they rush amain, And crush the puny driv'lers of the plain, Then, sheathing in a myrtle wreath their swords, Walk with the port and majesty of lords. So wake, ye true and native sons of song! Pour all your unbought wealth of soul along, And every energy to Nature give:— Then once more Hamlet, Richard, Lear, shall live. [There is a world of mind, which few can know] There is a world of mind, which few can know, High raised above the sensual crowd below, Where thought is pure and free, and fancy fires In rapture, where the mounting soul aspires, And sails on wings untiring,—heaven is there, And all is grand and beautiful, and fair. How the heart swells beneath the living tide, That rolls in kindling effluence, deep and wide! How man drinks in the clear, untainted ray, And dwells delighted in meridian day! The mists that dimmed him, and the crimes that sunk, When blind with folly and with pleasure drunk, Are all dispersed, and o'er his august head Heaven's purest light in streams of love is shed: As when an eagle, from the mountain's height, Lifts to the god of day his towering flight, Spurns with strong wing the fields of nether air, And soars where ether girds him, pure and rare, With keen eye fixed upon the burning ball, He feels no more this cold and earthly thrall, But, ever mounting with intense desire, Seeks with untiring flight the fount of fire. O that my soul had always been thus high, Had found no joy, no home beneath the sky! O had perfection been my only aim, My spirit kindled with a purest flame, Its energies all active, all awake, A thirst that heaven, and heaven alone, could slake,— O had this boundless, quenchless fire been mine, My soul might still in all its brightness shine: But sense has poured around its inky streams, And in its Stygian current quenched the beams; It cannot rise, it will not sink, it must Waste with this mortal body into dust; It has one wish, one only,—in the grave To find for all its sorrows Lethe's wave, And there in deep forgetfulness to lie, And know that body, feeling, thought, must die, That all the glories of our heaven will fade, And hell be but a formless phantom's shade. [He spake, and, springing from th' embattled ground] He spake, and, springing from th' embattled ground, Soared from the wond'ring hosts that gazed around: Transformed to spirit, through the yielding air His wavy wings aloft their burden bear; His shield hangs o'er his shoulder, like the moon, When pale she glitters in her highest noon; His spear is tipt with lightning, and his crest Waves with majestic sweep, and round his breast His gold-bossed corselet flashes, like the gem That glitters in a Cæsar's diadem; His flight is as a meteor, when it sails O'er the blue sky, and far behind it trails A stream of liquid silver;—now more dim, His airy form in ether seems to swim, Lessens and lessens to the admiring sight, Then disappears amid the solemn night: So fled the prodigy, and, wrapped in awe, The kneeling hosts the heavenly herald saw. [Malvacea calls her tribes around her throne] Malvacea calls her tribes around her throne, Decked in her crimson robe and golden zone; Around her flowing locks she binds a wreath Of brightest blossoms, while her curls beneath, Of softest auburn, wanton in the wind, And her argentine veil floats loose behind. Her nymphs attend, from meadow and from stream, From plain and hillock,—gay as morning's beam. The tropic Naiad, Carolinea, moves Resplendent through Guiana's giant groves; O'er the blue wave she bends, and round her binds Loose floating robes, that wanton in the winds; A gaudy chaplet decks her flowing hair, Such as the the festal maids of Chio wear, Bright crimson sprigs on yellow beds repose, And morning's radiance mingles with the rose. Where Niger grandly rolls his mystic wave, And Afric's jetty nymphs in freedom lave, Majestic Adansonia rears her form, And braves, through countless years, the flood and storm; The gathered tribes beneath her boughs enjoy Kind Nature's simple gifts without alloy, Indulge in slumbers, which no cares invade, Secure beneath this wilderness of shade, Or, dancing, lead the happy moments by, When evening suns go down the golden sky; And as the ceaseless generations roll, From life's first dawn, to death's unerring goal, Amid the wreck, her head she firmly rears, And bears the wasting of a thousand years. In silken fleece more white than Zemla's snow, Whose spotless folds in loose disorder flow, Through India's forests soft Bombacia moves, And lightly wanders in the woods she loves; Above her tower the Gauts, their sable walls, Down which the rain-stream, thund'ring, foaming, falls, Shed coolness o'er her, and the plains below, Through which those streams in soft meanders flow, Their flower-starred thickets and their rice-clad vales, Their groves that load with balm the passing gales, Their tapering pagods and their spiry walls, Their vine-clad cots, their bamboo-pillared halls, All lie before her, like a fairy dream, That glows and glitters in the evening beam. [In endless contrariety has fled] In endless contrariety has fled My feverish being; love and fame have fed My better thoughts, and been my life. My frame Was ill adapted to my spirit's flame, And blasted with the cold and heavy curse Of fear and weakness, Heaven can send no worse; And they were both perverted in the hour When unfledged reason had but feeble power, And they did war together, till the clay Gained mastery o'er the mind's immortal ray; Immortal in its longings, for it felt The beauty of perfection, and it dwelt On images of light and love, and drew Those pictured pleasures that are known by few, And it would fix the deep glance of its eye Upon the brightness of an evening sky, And it would fashion on the arch of blue, And on the rainbow-clouds of gayest hue, A world of happiness, and there would trace The ideal form of loveliness and grace, And then I was entranced, and I would seem Ascending to my Eden on the beam That fell so bright upon me, and my flight Was as the twinkling of a ray of light, And I would dream for hours, until my soul In unmixed feeling, soft and pure, would roll. SONNET. Farewell! ye visions of my wayward brain, Farewell! I send you from this lonely bower; But I shall ne'er forget your soothing power, Although perhaps we never meet again; Yet I have not communed with you in vain, If but some portion of that hallowed fire, Which roused the ancient bard to pour his strain, Has warmed my lips and raised my spirit higher. Ye go abroad upon a stormy sea, But there are some, perchance, may not despise Such trifles, though they were composed by me, And they may view them with approving eyes While I, as I have ever been, shall be, Lone reader of the woods, the waters, and the skies. THE END.</field>
