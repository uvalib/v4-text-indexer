      <field name="fulltext">ON THE DEATH OF THE Rev. NATHANIEL EVANS, Who departed this Life in his 26th Year; a dutiful and only Son of aged and affectionate Parents. By LAURA. Slow to yon Grave approaches Strephon's Bierâ Why down each Cheek descends the tender Tear? When, unreclaim'd, the Vicious fall, we weep; But with the virtuous Dead each Woe should sleep; For Heav'n ordain'd, that Death should boast his Reign, Ere the purg'd Soul celestial Heights can gain. Yet such a Train of dawning Virtues join'd, To grace, in bright Assemblage, Strephon's Mind, Our Loss we mourn, nor think that such alone Are those a gracious Saviour deigns to ownâ That Thought, that cheering Thought, ye ancient Pair, Must calm your Woe, and wipe the falling Tear; There's nought besides can mitigate your Grief; No human Hand can minister Reliefâ A Son, a darling Son, your Maker gave! Behold him breathless in yon gloomy Grave! With every Virtue opening fair to View; Lost to the WorldâA Season lost to you! As some fair Plant in blooming Verdure gay, Refresh'd with Rain, beneath the solar Ray, Kindly unfolds to shade its natal Earth, In grateful Tribute for its genial Birth; Till, from the North, some chilling Blast descendsâ Instant, the Plant, beneath its Fury, bends, Struggles awhile, and thenâdrops quite away To fell Destruction a fair blooming Prey. The Parent Soil, left desolate and bare, Shrinks with each Ruffle of th' inclement Air. Thus fell, ye mournful Pair, your Ages' Prop; Yet still Religion gives this cheering Hope, That, when some Years have rolled their Cares away, Your Souls, transported to the Realms of Day, Shall join your Strephon, who kept full in Sight Those sacred Mansions of eternal Light. A manly, modest Piety inform'd His searching Spirit, and his Bosom warm'd: Blest with a Judgment, steady, strong and clear, That shunn'd alike the Giddy and Severe, He scorn'd to drag stern Superstition's Chain, Or mingle with th' enthusiastic Train! JEHOVAH's Justice fill'd his Soul with Awe, Yet from EMANUEL's Love he learnt to draw That heav'nly Peace, which taught his Soul to singâ His dying SoulâO Death, where is thy Sting? O Grave, the Victor! where is now thy Boast? Come, JESUS, comeâin Thee their Pangs are lost! DAPHNIS and MENALCAS, A PASTORAL ECLOGUE. WRITTEN 1758. Shall fam'd Arcadia own the tuneful choir, And fair Sicilia boast the matchless lyre? Shall Gallia's groves resound with heav'nly lays, And Albion's poets claim immortal bays? And this new world ne'er feel the muse's fire; No beauties charm us, or no deeds inspire? O Pennsylvania! shall no son of thine Glow with the raptures of the sacred nine? Ne'er rouze the soul, by strokes of magic kind, Just war to wage, or humanize mankind; With sweetest sounds the virgin's soul control, Or in Elysium wrap the lover's soul? Fir'd with the thought, I court the Sylvan muse, Her magic influence o'er me to diffuse; Whilst I aspire to wake the rural reed, And sing of swains, whose snowy lambkins feed On Schuylkill's banks, with shady walnuts crown'd; And bid the vales with music melt around. Soon as the rays that gild the orient dawn, Ting'd the blue hills, and pearl'd each dewy lawn, Two swains arose and spread their bleating train O'er the fresh verdure of a flow'ry plain; Then sought a hill where purple violets bloom'd, And fragrant scents the downy air perfum'd; Close by whose side there stray'd a murm'ring brook, Where soft reclin'd, each fix'd his oaken crook; When gay Menalcas the long silence broke, And pensive Daphnis, thus returning spoke. Menalcas, See Nature's sweets profusely round display'd, Flow'rs paint the lawn, and green bedecks the shade; The feather'd choir in carols hail the day, And new-blown hawthorns feel yon heav'nly ray; Pomona spreads her dulcet charms around, And buxom Pan o'erleaps the pregnant ground. All but my Daphnis hail the rising morn; Each face but his congenial smiles adorn. When kindly nature thus invites to joy, What irksome cares can Daphnis' rest destroy? Have thy young lambs by wolves devouring bled, Or some kind brother mingled with the dead? O say what grief involves the troubled swain, That thus he slights the shepherd and his strain? Daphnis. Nature, 'tis true, exults in vernal bloom, Each grove is music, and each field perfume; The fruitful trees their blossom'd foliage rear, And jocund shepherds hail the golden year; The groves, the vales, the hills and ev'ry lawn, With sprightly echoes wake the blushing dawnâ But lawns, and hills, and vales and groves around, Are nought to Daphnis but an empty sound; The linnet's songs no more entice my ear, Nor charm the beauties of the smiling year; The day's refulgence now delights no more, Nor night's cool shade expanded to each shore! But since my friend can sympathize with pain, Know then why this indifference to thy strain. On my young lambs no prowling wolves have fed, No brother-swain is number'd with the dead; But cruel Delia has unfaithful prov'd, And slights the swain that oft she swore she lov'd. Say then, Menalcas! has not Daphnis cause To break all Nature's and all Reason's laws; To plunge me headlong from yon mountain's brow, And end my sorrows in the waves below. Menalcas. Can lovely Delia e'er unfaithful prove, Or slight the swain to whom she vow'd her love? The rabid wolves may browse with harmless sheep, And forest-doves with tow'ring eagles keep; The crabbed thorn with clustering grapes may bend, And humble willows to proud oaks ascend; The vales out-top the lofty mountain's browâ But charming Delia cannot break her vow! Daphnis. Cease shepherd, cease! for now no Delia charms, Nor more shall Daphnis wanton in her arms; The spreading boughs no more shall guard our love, Nor Delia's name be figur'd in each grove! For me, my sheep run bleating o'er the plain, While I to woods and flinty rocks complain! Milder than Delia flinty rocks are grown, For in sad echoes they return my moan; But haughty Delia scorns my ardent flame, And bids her shepherd woo some humbler dame! Menalcas. The sportful trouts may leave their wat'ry plains, To dwell in woods, and tune spontaneous strains; The warbling linnets may in rivers glide, And dash the billows with the dolphin's pride; Yon distant steers, that drag the heavy plough, May, like the squirrel, spring from bough to boughâ But heav'nly Delia cannot faithless prove, Nor barter for vile gain her promis'd love! Daphnis. The breeze that shakes the spangl'd dew-drops round, The swelling floods that burst the meadow's bound, Are not more wav'ring than the female mind! Wild as the waves, unstable as the wind! Menalcas. With gentler manners treat the beauteous race, Nor say, if one's unfaithful, all are base! Let thy sweet pipe beguile this ill-tim'd woe, While from my reed spontaneous notes shall flow. Behold our flocks are scatt'ring o'er the plain, Proceed we then to chaunt the Sylvan strain. Daphnis. Come, then, Menalcas! tuneful shepherd rise, Thy song shall praise the Sovereign of the skies; Whilst I will join in that exalted theme, Nor more repeat the faithless fair-one's name! ODE TO A FRIEND. 1758. I. Why so tim'rous, gentle friend? Pri'thee, banish care and dread; Of harmless pleasure, know no end, Till thou'rt number'd with the dead. II. What can keep thee from the grave, If it please th' Almighty pow'r? What destroy thee if he'll save, Or rob thee of the passing hour? III. What should move the pow'r divine, Thee, good mortal, to destroy? Then, with me, right-pleasing join, To gild the wing'd time with joy. IV. But not in pleasure's Syren-charms, I mean to lose the heart: I know that mirth has sad alarms Where wisdom has no part. V. But let passion's easy gale, Thy bark with rapture sweep, While powerful reason shall prevail And guide her o'er the deep. VI. Then chearful flow thy transient breath, With courage arm thy heart; Immortal life begins in death, And smiles at his grim dart. EPISTOLARY ODE To a FRIEND. I. Like as Lybia's burning sand, Or the parch'd Arabian plain, Which gentle Eurus never fann'd, Wou'd drink th' unfathomable mainâ So is the wretch who endless craves, And restless pines in ev'ry stateâ O place him with the worst of slaves, Whether in high or low estate. Heap him around with massy wealth, High-throne him on the seat of pow'r; Each gen'rous joy he'll use by stealth, While want shall prey on ev'ry hour. Let glitt'ring pomp allure his soul, Or nobler fame his mind dilate; Thro' complicated plagues he'll roll, And dire vexations still create. The first-born mortal upon earth, When round him smiling Nature play'd, With discontent was void of mirth, Tho' he o'er ev'ry creature sway'd. II. He who contented spends his daysâ Calm as the clear unruffled stream, His life in gentle current strays, Mild as the maiden's silver dream. Be he born to till the field, Or in war the sword to wield; If he o'er the midnight oil, Wastes his life in learned toil, Studious to instruct mankind Where true happiness to find; Or if o'er the lawless main, He roams in search of sordid gain; Or sorts with nobles in proud ease, Or humble swains in cottages; Be he with content but blestâ He's the happy man confest! III. Listen, dear Strephon to my songâ O herd not with ambitious slaves, Nor join thou with the vulgar throngâ Their joys unstable as the waves. Strephon, thrice blest with fruitful plains, The lover of a sapient theme; Strephon, whose sweetly-soothing strains Flow gently as thy native streamâ O leave the ruthless scenes of war, Unfit art thou for rude alarms, Beside thy gentle That great river on which Philadelphia stands.Delaware, Come, Strephon, seek more pleasing charms. Here, while o'er the fertile vallies Thou shalt tuneful stray along, I will make repeated sallies, To catch the transport of thy song; Then mutual joy shall swell our soul, Attendant to bright wisdom's strain, While we shall quaff the friendly bowl Far from the noisy and the vain. PANEGYRIC ODE TO THE MEMORY OF GENERAL WOLFE, SLAIN AT THE SIEGE OF QUEBEC. I. What theme propitious to the lay; What gallant hero shall we choose, Whose name the sounding chord shall sway, And fire the glowing muse? What chief in Britain's martial train, Has fame with palm victorious crown'd, Whose deeds upon the embattled plain, Her golden trump shall ceaseless sound? 'Tis WolfeâBeneath the spacious sky, A hero of sublimer name, The searchful muse shall ne'er descry To consecrate with deathless fame. II. Where great St. Lawrence rolls its awful flood, He, daring, led Britannia's warrior-band, Scal'd its proud banks, and pierc'd the desart wood, That veils the horrors of the hostile land. Soon Canada confess'd his warlike might, If on the plain conspicuous he appear'd, Or 'gainst Quebec's aspiring tow'ry height, His thund'ring arm all-dreadfully he rear'd. III. Now lights his vengeance on the dastard foeâ So once Pelides, on the Trojan field, (Whilst death stood glaring on his crimson'd shield) Fill'd ev'ry trembling Dardan heart with woe. Thick as loud whirlwinds strew the fading leaves, Along the autumnal plain, Array'd in arms, he fell'd the Gallic chiefs; A welt'ring breathless train. IV. What shall Britannia's wrath appease, Or what restrain her flaming ire, When foes disturb her sacred peace, And with just rage her champions fire? What glorious deeds around thee beam'd, O Wolfe! on Abram's The plains near Quebec, where Wolfe engaged and routed the French, are called Abraham's Plains. purpled plain, When the warm sanguin'd current stream'd Of all the flow'r of Gallia slain? Nought but the trumpet's martial sound, The clang of polish'd arms, The thund'ring steed that beats the ground, Could fill thy soul with charms! V. The destin'd hour at length appears, Celestial victory emits her ray, And rids Britannia of her fears, And echoes round propitious day: The hills around With joy resound, And spread the golden tidings far; The trident-bearing god Mounting from his deep abode, To Albion tells the auspicious war; Tells how, with ancient valour fraught, Her sons resum'd paternal might; How the intrepid Townshend fought, And mighty Wolfe put hosts to flight! VI. But while superior to all fear, With his bold ranks the hero drove, O'er heaps of slain, in full careerâ A shaft, commission'd from above, Full to his breast with fatal speed, Took its unerring way, Down fell great Wolfe amidst the dead, And purpled where he layâ âHow goes the fight?â he cries, (For round his head Grim death was spread And dim'd his rolling eyes.) A gen'rous friend reply'd, âThe foes are fled!â âEnough!â he said, And without groaning dy'd. VII. Such are the chiefs that merit fair renown, And follow bold where glory leads the way! Such are the chiefs that grace a monarch's crown, And from the muse demand th' immortal lay! Chiefs that from Albion's billow-beaten shore, Can risque the perils of th' Atlantic flood, And dauntless ride thro' fields bedew'd with gore, To bathe their youthful arms in Gallic blood! Proud in the cause of honour to expire, To stem the onset of the hostile band; And dare the deep-mouth'd cannon's thund'rous fire, To crown with joy Britannia's happy land. Tho' Wolfe shall shine in flaming arms no more, Now thron'd in bliss above the cloudless skies; Cease, O ye sons of Britain, to deplore, Whilst Brunswick reigns, yet other Wolfes shall rise! ELEGY TO THE Memory of Theophilus Grew, A. M. Professor of Mathematics in the College of Philadelphia. Why will soft sorrow thus o'erwhelm my soul, And heart-felt anguish ev'ry thought control? To scenes of woe why will the muse retire, And cull sad sounding accents for the lyre? What shade neglected asks the gentle tear, To bathe in grief the long forgotten bier? 'Tis Grew descends unheeded to the grave, With no libation of Castalia's wave. What tho' the theme transcends my artless lays, The muse shall swell her numbers in thy praise: The murm'ring streams shall echo to the sound, And groves responsive spread the strains around; Slow winds shall bear the heavy notes along, And distant hills return the mournful song. T' enlarge the soul, and clear the dubious mind, T' unfold celestial wonders to mankind, To stamp bright knowledge on thy youthful care, With sweet persuasion and endearing air, With gentle manners to entice the heart, Was once thy happy and peculiar art. But snatch'd, alas! to yon immortal plains, Where glorious angels hymn seraphic strains; High where yon beamy orbs, resplendent, glow, He drops a tear for this sad world below. But Grew, thy planets downward shall be hurl'd, And wild confusion sink a guilty world; E'en time's white fore-lock shall in chains be bound, Earth melt to dross, and Cynthia cease her round. Then shall oblivion blast the hero's fame, The pomp of monarchs, and the poet's flame; Then thy good name with matter's self shall blend, Forgot the father, husband, and the friend. Quick as the shuttle fly all human things, Time wafts us rapid on his fleeting wings; Soon shall the swain that tunes this plaintive lyre, Kiss the cold earth, and all his flame expire; Then may some muse, by tender pity mov'd, Moan in soft elegy the youth she lov'd. Yet blooming virtue shall triumphant rise, Spurn the dull earth, and gain her native skies; Then shall the just with holy raptures fir'd, With charms transported, and with God inspir'd, Strike their gold harps, and wake the lofty chord, In joyful chorus round th' eternal Lord! Oh! may my soul by thy example warm'd, With Virtue's rules, and Virtue's sons be charm'd; Regard them tho' they shine in humble state, Far from the glitter of the wealthy great. Blest man, in counsel as in sense profound, True to thy trust, and ever blameless found; Stranger to strife, a noble mind confest, No raging discord harbour'd in thy breast; Peaceful thou walk'd this wild of âweeds and flow'rs,â Where envy hisses, and blind fortune show'rs; Where systems endless frantic zeal inspire, Warm youth they madden, and cold age they fire. Led by no mode, thou follow'd Nature's laws, And trusted in the one unerring cause! Thus pass'd thy footsteps thro' this mazy round Whilst thy wing'd genius soar'd to worlds around; Till grisly death with darkness clos'd thy eyes, And angels snatch'd thy spirit to the skies! But God is wiseâthen, to his righteous sway, Submit, my muse, and cease thy plaintive lay. A RIDDLE. WRITTEN 1759. Barricado'd with white bone, Lab'ring under many a groan, Curtain'd in my room with red, And smoothly laid in crimson bed; 'Tis I dissolve the stony heart, And comfort's balmy joys impart; 'Tis I can rule the wav'ring croud, Or tame the haughty and the proud; 'Tis I o'er beauty oft prevail, That queen of life's capricious vale; 'Tis I can fire the warrior's soul, Or passion's giddy voice control; Senates have felt my lordly sway, And kings my magic pow'r obey; 'Tis I, so garrulously gay, That rouze the dames whose heads are grey; Gilded o'er with truth and lies, Under many a mixt disguise, I dress to cheat unpractis'd youth, With falshood's garb for honest truth; Xantippe bold, in dead of night, Taught Socrates to own my might! Strange enchantress, motely creature, Oddest prodigy of nature! As raging billows, now I'm wild, And now as warbling fountains mild; Now religion's laws proclaiming, And now the good and just defaming; Now cementing patriotism, And now in church provoking schism. Enough, O muse!âkind reason cries, The man who has this monster dies! Expound my riddle, if you're able, For 'twas this confounded Babel! ODE ON THE PROSPECT OF PEACE. 1761. I. I. When elemental conflicts rage, And heav'n is wrap'd in tempests dire, When storms with storms dread combat wage, And thunders roll Ã¦therial fire;â Returning zephyrs od'rous race, And radiant Sol's all-chearing face, The trembling mortals most desire. When Eurus charg'd with livid clouds, Scours o'er old ocean's wild domain, And Boreas rends the vessel's shrouds, And o'er her swells the raging main; If lighter breezes should succeed, And Iris sweet, of varied hue, Lift o'er the main her beamy head, What raptures fill the marine crew! Thus, when Bellona (ruthless maid!) Her empire thro' the world has spread, And death his flag has proud-display'd O'er legions that in battle bled;â If Peace, bedeck'd with olive robe, (Resplendent nymph, sweet guest of heav'n) Transfuse her balm around the globe, A theme of joy to man is giv'n. Then wake, O muse! thy sweetest laysâ Returning peace demands thy praise; And while the notes in varied cadence sound, Eye thou the Theban Pindar. Swan that soars o'er heav'nly ground. II. If thou from Albion's sea-girt shore, Advent'rous muse wilt deign to rove, Inclin'd remotest realms t'explore And soothe the savage soul to love; Hither wave thy wand'ring pinion, Here be fix'd thy last dominion, Warbling in For Pennsylvania 'Sylvania's grove. Bright-ey'd Euphrosyne! attend, If genial Peace can aught avail, With all thy graceful charms descend, And o'er the youthful lyre prevail. BounteousPages 23 and 24 are printed at the end of the volume in the source text. Peace with lavish hand, To ev'ry shore thy blessings strew, O veil the blood-polluted land, And all they grateful joys renew. Thy blissful pregnant reign restore, And calm the breasts of angry Kings; Thy horn of Amalthean shore Ope, and expand thy golden wings; Till trade secure her treasure beams, And science re-assumes her shades; Till shepherds quass untainted streams, And hinds enjoy their native glades; Till the glad muses strike the lyre, And virtuous social deeds inspire; Till the loud drums no more shall bid to arms prepare, Nor brazen trumpets breath horrid din of war. III. Auspicious pow'r, whose salutary ray Form'd this new world, and rear'd her infant fame, Extend anew thy mitigating sway, And quell the hero's battle-breathing flame, Ye fragrant myrtles, ope your peaceful bow'rs, And charm the warrior with your pleasing scenes, Shield him with woodbine's aromatic flow'rs, And for his sopha spread your velvet greens, For him the flute mellifluous shall blow In Lydian music, sounding soft and low, And blooming beauty with attractive art, Shall sweetly melt the tumults of his heart; The nectar'd bowl with rosy garlands twin'd, Shall waft his sorrows to the vagrant wind, While the victorious laurel of renown, In verdant wreaths his manly brows shall crown. II. I. Too long has war's terrific train, (The barbed spear and reeking blade) Made nations rue their chieftains slain, And sanguin'd every muse's shade. From distant Volga's rapid floods, To Canada's high-tow'ring woods, Has the deadly cannon bray'd. From where th'effulgent god of day Impearls Arabia's spicy fields, To where his setting lustres playâ The world to British valor yields. How has bold Clive, with martial toil, O'er India born his conqu'ring lance, For Brunswick gain'd the distant soil, And dash'd th'aspiring hopes of France? Let Goree, rich with flaming ore, Heroic Keppel's acts proclaim, And Senegal's Ivory.Eburnean shore Resound to future times his name. O'er red Germania's hostile waste, Britannia's chiefs have conquering shone. Brave Elliot's warlike fates have grac'd His Monarch's high illustrious throne; And Granby's deeds the muses claim To swell th' immortal trump of fame. But victory enough has wav'd her glitt'ring wand, With British honors grac'd, o'er ev'ry prostrate land! II. Witness ye plains bedew'd with gore, So late ambitious Gallia's boast, Where howling o'er the desert shore, Was seen the genius of the coast. Thus, leaning on her shatter'd spear, She wildly wail'd in deep despair, Her fall'n tow'rs and vanquish'd hostâ âAs Niobe (when Juno's hate Pursu'd to death her tender care) I moan my offspring's hapless fate, And vex with sighs the passing air. Not with less grief my bosom heaves, Than did the breast of Hector's sire, When slain were all his Dardan chiefs, And Ilium blaz'd with Grecian fire. For lo! where heap'd with slaughter'd Gauls, Is Louisburgh a ruin'd pile! Her bulwarks and stupendous walls Are whelm'd in dust and ashes vile. Imperial Lawrence heaves with woe, Of many a Gallic chief the grave, And as his purple billows flow, To hoary Neptune's coral cave, Tells how my vaunting troops, o'erthrown, Britannia's matchless prowess own; Tells how Quebec, so late for martial might renown'd, Her rocky ramparts crush'd, lies smoaking on the ground. III. What force can Albion's warlike sons dismay, Dauntless who mingle in th' embattled plain? What toils dishearten, or what dangers stay? Not rocks, nor deserts, nor the boisterous main! How torn my laurels, by her Wolfe's dread arm! O'er mountains huge, who chas'd my armed band, Rouz'd the fierce savage, with dire war's alarm, And hurl'd his thunder o'er my carnag'd land! No more gay trophies shall emblaze my name, Nor Gallia's realms re-echo with my fame. Lost are those honours which my heroes gain'd, With blood my temples and my domes are stain'd; But men directed by a heav'nly hand, 'Tis vain, 'tis mad, 'tis impious to withstandââ She spoke, and mounting from a lofty height, Westward she wing'd her solitary flight. III. I. Thus has Britannia's glory beam'd Where'er bright PhÃ¦bus, from his car, To earth his chearful rays hath stream'd, Adown the chrystal vault of air. Enough o'er Britain's shining arms, Hath victory display'd her charms, Amid the horrid pomp of warâ Descend then, Peace, angelic maid, And smooth Bellona's haggard brow; Haste to diffuse thy healing aid, Where'er implor'd by scenes of woe. Henceforth, whoe'er disturbs thy reign, Or stains the world with human gore, Be they from earth (a gloomy train!) Banish'd to hell's profoundest shore; Where vengeance, on Avernus' lake, Rages with furious AtÃ© bound; And black rebellion's fetters shake, And discord's hideous murmurs sound; Where envy's noxious snakes entwine Her temples round, in Gorgon-mood, And bellowing faction rolls supine Along the flame be-curled flood!â Hence, then, to that accursed place, Disturbers of the human race! And with you bear ambition wild, and selfish pride, With persecution foul, and terror by her side. II. Thus driv'n from earth war's horrid trainâ O Peace, thou nymph divine, draw near! Here let the muses fix their reign, And crown with fame each rolling year. Source of joy and genuine pleasure, Queen of quiet, queen of leisure, Haste thy votaries to chear! Cherish'd beneath thy hallow'd rule, Shall Pennsylvania's glory rise; Her sons, bred up in Virtue's school, Shall lift her honors to the skiesâ A state thrice blest with lenient sway, Where liberty exalts the mind; Where plenty basks the live long day, And pours her treasures unconfin'd. Hither, ye beauteous virgins tend, With Arts and Science by your side, Whose skill th' untutor'd morals mend, And to fair honor mankind guide; And with you bring the graces three, To fill the soul with glory's blaze; Whose charms give charms to poesy, And consecrate th' immortal laysââ Such as when mighty Pindar sung, Thro' the Alphean vallies rung; Or such as, Meles, by thy lucid fountains flow'd, When bold MÃ¦onides with heav'nly transports glow'd. III. To such, may Delaware, majestic flood, Lend, from his flow'ry banks, a ravish'd ear; Such notes as may delight the wise and good, Or saints celestial may endure to hear! For if the muse can aught of time descry, Such notes shall sound thy crystal waves along, Thy cities fair with glorious Athens vie, Nor pure Ilissus boast a nobler song. On thy fair banks, a Fane to Virtue's name Shall riseâand Justice light her holy flame. All hail then, Peace! restore the golden days, And round the ball diffuse Britannia's praise; Stretch her wide empire to the world's last end, Till Kings remotest to her sceptre bend! A RURAL ODE, Written by the Author at the Age of Sixteen. I. Ye Dryads fair, whose temples round, Wave wreaths of odoriferous flow'rs; Lead me your Sylvan scenes amidst, Where bloom your rosy-fringed bow'rs. II. Nymph of the wave Scene, the banks of Schuylkill, which runs by the west side of Philadelphia, and falls into the Delaware a little below the city., sweet Naiad hear, While thy clear waters banks along, With careless steps, I pleasing stray, And warble forth my youthful song. III. Now the gay rays of orient light, Bedeck the saffron-mantled morn, And from Favonius' balmy wing, Drops liquid pearl on ev'ry thorn. IV. The gilded groves, with verdure clad, Reflect bright PhÃ¦bus' golden beams, While his celestial glories flame, Down the translucent purling streams. V. From off each daisy-painted field, And from the lilly-paved vales, Zephyr collects a rich perfume, And scents his soft cosmetic gales; VI. Whose honied pinions round dispense, Hygeia's heav'n-descended store, Chasing each noxious breath away, And sweet'ning every fragrant shore. VII. Here keeps his court fresh-blushing health, His brows with blooming garlands bound; Here bathes him in fair Schuylkill's wave, And sports its hills and lawns around; VIII. Two virgins mild his train support, In snowy spotless robes array'd, One guides his will to actions pure, And e'er by one his table's spread; IX. These virgins twain, were ever nam'd, Sweet Temperance, with eye serene; And Chastity, whose heav'nly birth, Was pictur'd in her modest mein. X. Still, as Aurora onward moves, His fleecy flocks the shepherd-swain Drives from their folds, in jovial glee, And whitens all the verdant plain. XI. The fawns, with nimble-footed speed, (Fleet as the winged passing gale) Bound o'er the mountains flow'ry side, Or sweep the low-descending vale. XII. In yonder gay-enamell'd mead, The starling plumes his golden wings, Then tow'ring up the azure height, He mounts sublime, and soaring sings. XIII. The yellow finch, and linnet blue, In mattins wild salute the day, While their sweet songs, by echo caught, In double-sounding notes decay. XIV. A limpid fountain gurgling flows, From 'midst yon ivy-twisted cave; And lo! the lovely Chloe cools Her limbs in its translucent wave! XV. Deep in yon old sequest'red grove, Where the down-dashing torrents roll, Ascends on fancy's roving wing, The rapture-breathing poet's soul! XVI. Lo! foaming o'er the rough cascade, The lab'ring billows force their way, Then mingling with the snow-white flood, In curling eddies onward stray; XVII. While down the smooth-meand'ring stream, The shining fishes, sportive, glide; The perch with silver-glitt'ring scales, And trout with gold-besprinkled side. XVIII. These are your blessings, Sylvan maidsâ The sunny hills and shady woods, Delightful vallies, pleasant plains, Clear skies, sweet air, and crystal floodsâ XIX. For hills ye have, (tho' lost to fame) That fair as thy my Hybla show, And fields that would with Tempe vie, Streams that might with A river in Lydia, said to flow on golden sands; mentioned by Horace, Juvenal, &amp;c. Pactolus flow. XX. Here could I ever, ever rove, And quit the world's contentious scenesâ What joy, with innocence and truth, To wrap me in your charming greens? XXI. But fate and fortune adverse call, And snatch me to the busy throng! Adieu then, rural sweets, adieu! And cease, thou dear-deluding song! ODE TO A FRIEND. Quem tu Melpomene, semel Nascentem placido lumine videris, &amp;c. Hor. I. Thrice blest is he, whose placid birth The warbling Muses hover'd round; Novice to all the ills of earth, While wrapt in music's soothing sound. II. If stern Bellona's thund'ring ire, Hurls the proud Monarch from his throne, He whom the sacred Nine inspire Shall make each fleeting hour his own. III. Let Gaul with Belgia's arms unite, And haughty Spain resume her rage; He whom Castalia's streams delight, Shall ev'ry rising fear assuage. IV. If hostile savages alarm, And threat'ning warriors fill each plain, Sweet poesy his grief shall charm, And sportive breezes steal his pain. V. If grisly death, with terrors crown'd, His heav'n-attender'd soul dismay; Hark! he awakes th' enchanting sound, And ev'ry spectre shrinks away. VI. But when resplendent beauty's train Commands the soft accordant lyre; What transports breathe in ev'ry strain, And kindle Love's celestial fire! VII. Her cheeks he paints as blushing dawn, Her eyes to dim Apollo's rays, Her breath more balmy than lawn When round the orient lustre plays. VIII. Yet if fair Friendship's hallow'd flame In his enraptur'd bosom glows, His strain still rises with his theme, Each note still more divinely flows. IX. Let wretched misers clasp their ore, And vulgar breasts in sense delight; The muse shall purer joys explore, And wing a more exalted flight. HYMN TO MAY. I. Now had the beam of Titan gay Usher'd in the blissful May, Scatt'ring from his pearly bed, Fresh dew on ev'ry mountain's head; Nature mild and debonnair, To thee, fair maid, yields up her care. May, with gentle plastic hand, Clothes in flow'ry robe the land; O'er the vales the cowslips spreads, And eglantine beneath the shades; Violets blue befringe each fountain, Woodbines lace each steepy mountain; Hyacinths their sweets diffuse, And the rose its blush renews; With the rest of Flora's train, Decking lowly dale or plain. II. Thro' creation's range, sweet May! Nature's children own thy swayâ Whether in the chrystal flood, Am'rous, sport the finny brood; Or the feather'd tribes declare, That they breathe thy genial air, While they warble in each grove Sweetest notes of artless love; Or their wound the beasts proclaim, Smitten with a fiercer flame; Or the passion higher rise, Sparing none beneath the skies, But swaying soft the human mind With feelings of extatic kindâ Thro' wide creation's range, sweet May! All Nature's children own thy sway. III. Oft will I, (e'er Phosphor's The Morning Star. light Quits the glimm'ring skirts of night) Meet thee in the clover-field, Where thy beauties thou shalt yield To my fancy, quick and warm, List'ning to the dawn's alarm, Sounded loud by The Cock. Chanticleer, In peals that sharply pierce the ear. And, as Sol his flaming car Urges up the vaulted air, Shunning quick the scorching ray, I will to some covert stray; Coolly bow'rs or latent dells, Where light-footed silence dwells, And whispers to my heav'n-born dream, Fair Schuylkill by thy winding stream! There I'll devote full many an hour, To the still-finger'd Morphean-pow'r, And entertain my thirsty soul With draughts from Fancy's fairy bowl; Or mount her orb of varied hue, And scenes of heav'n and earth review. IV. Nor in milder Eve's decline, As the sun forgets to shine, And slopping down th' Ã¦therial plain, Plunges in the Western main, Will I forbear due strain to pay To the song-inspiring May; But as The Evening Star. Hesper 'gins to move Round the radiant court of Jove, (Leading thro' the azure sky All the starry progeny, Emitting prone their silver light, To re-illume the shades of night) Then, the dewy lawn along, I'll carol forth my grateful song, Viewing with transported eye The blazing orbs that roll on high, Beaming lustre, bright and clear, O'er the glowing hemisphere. Thus from the early-blushing morn, Till the dappled eve's return, Will I, in free unlabour'd lay, Sweetly sing the charming May! AN ANACREONTIC ODE. Hence with sorrow, spleen and care! Muse, awake the jocund air; Wreathe thy brows in myrtle twine, And assist the gay design; Strike the trembling string with pleasure. Till it sound the enchanting measure. Avaunt! thou fiend, pale melancholy! We are mortals free and jolly, Who delight to lose the soul, In the joy-inspiring bowlâ Fill the foaming chalice high, Till it speak with extasy; With rosy garland crown the wine, And steep Nepenthe, herb divine, In the bright nectareous cup, Till it swallow sadness up. Wine can dullest mortals raise, To deeds of glory, deeds of praise; If the warrior's breast it warms, Quick he burns for glorious arms, And nightly dreams of battles dire, Of giants huge in steel attire; Battlements he, proud, o'erthrows, And rides amidst a thousand foes. Thus, when Philip's dauntless son, With his drinking bouts had done, He rush'd a whirlwind on the plain, And mountain'd it with heaps of slain. If wine inspires the tuneful band, Who can the glowing strain withstand? Floods of music, all divine, Pour along in every line; And the wild Dithyrambic strain, Rushes thro' the poet's brain. AlcÃ¦us lov'd the purple juice; Sprightly Flaccus felt its use; And the sweet Anacreon, Warbled best when half-seas gone. Ivy-crown'd Bacchus hail! And, o'er my reeling song prevail! SONG. Extempore. I. The sprightly eye, the rosy cheek, The dimpled chin, and look so meek, The nameless grace and air; The ruby lip in sweetness drest, The softly-swelling angel breastâ All these adorn my fair! II. See! what unnumber'd beauties rove Around each feature of my love, And fire my rapt'rous soul! Ten thousand sweets her looks disclose; At ev'ry look my bosom glows, And yields to love's control. III. Just heav'ns! why gave ye charms like these, With ev'ry graceful art to please, To her whom rigid fate, Permits me not my pain to tell, And makes me sacred truth conceal From one I wish my mate. IV. Curse on the sordid thirst of gold! When tend'rest passions all are sold To win the world's applause; When, for desire, and love, and joy, Low interest shall our hours employ, And gain th' ignoble cause. To SYLVIA. A SONG. After her recovery from a fit of sickness. I. When at bleak Winter's stern command, Fair nature's blooming beauties fade, And the sad groves all leafless stand, And wither'd is each pleasing shade; II. No nightingale, or linnet gay, Is heard to wake the sprightly strain, No turtle pours her love-lorn lay, To sooth the soul of am'rous swain. III. But when the jovial hours appear, That usher in the vernal breeze, When young-ey'd spring bedecks the year, And clothes in verdant robe the trees; IV. The feather'd choristers prepare To swell the gratulating song, While thro' the soft expanse of air, Wild Music sweetly floats along. V. So when my Sylvia, lovely maid! Is by the touch of sickness pain'd, When on her cheeks the roses fade, And with pale white her lips are stain'd; VI. Oh then! my heart, oppress'd with woe And inward anguish, pines away; Nor from my lips does music flow, A stranger to the warbling layâ VII. But if the charming nymph renews The lively look, and health's soft bloom; Into my breast it does infuse New life, and dissipates my gloom. VIII. Soon then I snatch the willing reed, And soon it sounds my Sylvia's name; My wond'ring flocks forget to feed, And listen while I tell my flame. IX. Again the smiling sparkling eye Beams lustre o'er her heav'nly face; Again the cheek of vermil dye Sheds, blushful round, its wonted graceâ X. Again her heaving breasts betray A passion of sublimer kind; There all the loves and graces play, And there th' unerring archer Cupid. blind. XI. Again I clasp her round, in bliss, And press the yielding melting palm; Again I steal th' ambrosial kiss From lips distilling sweetest balm! SONG. I. Oft had I laugh'd at female pow'r, And slighted Venus' chainâ Then cheerful sped each fleeting hour, Unknown to eating pain; II. By Stoic rules, severely taught, To scorn bright beauty's charms, Sage wisdom sway'd each rising thought, And woo'd me to her arms; III. Till Sylvia, heav'nly Sylvia, came, Sweet pleasure play'd her round; Her lucid eyes shot forth a flame, That hardest hearts would wound. IV. Quick from my breast each bold resolve, In empty Ã¦ther flew; My limbs in trembling bliss dissolve, All wet with chilling dew. V. O charmer! cease that ardent gaze, Nor rob me of my rest; Such light'ning from those eye-lids plays, It burns my tortur'd breast. VI. Deluded swains, who, vainly proud, Assume gay freedom's air, And, boastful, scorn the prostrate crowd That sigh before the fair! VII. If once fair Sylvia you should meet, And view her heav'nly mien; To Love converted, at her feet, You'll hug the pleasing chain. AN ODE, Attempted in the Manner of Horace, TO MY INGENIOUS FRIEND, Mr. See an account of the Thomas Godfreys, father and son, in the American Magazine. The above little ode is addressed to the son. Mr. Evans and he were intimate in life, and in death not long divided. They possessed a kind of congenial spirits, and their fates were not dissimilar. Both courted the Muses from their very infancy; and both were called from this world as they were but entering into their state of manhood. On Mr. Godfrey's death, Mr. Evans collected and published his pieces in a small volume, and soon afterwards left his own pieces to the like friendly care of others.THOMAS GODFREY. I. While you, dear Tom, are forc'd to roam, In search of fortune, far from home, O'er bogs, o'er seas and mountains; I too, debar'd the soft retreat Of shady groves, and murmur sweet Of silver-prattling fountains, II. Must mingle with the bustling throng, And bear my load of cares along, Like any other sinner: For, where's the ecstasy in this, To loiter in poetic bliss, And go without a dinner? III. Flaccus, we know, immortal bard! With mighty kings and statesmen far'd, And liv'd in chearful plenty: But now, in those degenerate days, The slight reward of empty praise, Scarce one receives in twenty. IV. Well might the Roman swan, along The pleasing Tiber, pour his song, When blest with ease and quiet; Oft did he grace MÃ¦cenas' board, Who would for him throw by the lord, And in Falernian riot. V. But, dearest Tom! these days are past, And we are in a climate cast Where few the muse can relish; Where all the doctrine now that's told, Is that a shining heap of gold Alone can man embellish. VI. Then since 'tis thus, my honest friend, If you be wise, my strain attend, And counsel sage adhere to; With me, henceforward, join the crowd, And like the rest proclaim aloud, That MONEY is all VIRTUE! VII. Then may we both, in time, retreat To some fair villa, sweetly neat, To entertain the muses; And then life's noise and trouble leaveâ Supremely blest, we'll never grieve At what the world refuses. A SONG To MIRA; ON PARTING. I. Can my Mira leave her lover? Two long-ling'ring months to partâ World of time! Thou gentle rover, Where, O where's thy tender heart? II. Wilt thou thus thy person fever From my eyes and from my arms? For two tedious months, I never More shall view thy heav'nly charms! III. When, in some fair streams meander, Thou thy beauteous looks shall trace, May sweet echo cry,ââPhilander âClaims, as his, that angel-face.ââ IV. When thou tread'st, in blooming lustre, Some gay meadow's flow'ry side, And gay youths around thee cluster, To behold fair Nature's pride; V. Then, Oh then, my Mira! mind thee To beware each shepherd's art; Know that heav'n and love design'd thee Mistress of Philander's heart. VI. Then remember each sweet hour That in pleasing pain we've spent, When Cupid, in triumphant pow'r, Thro' our hearts his arrows sent. VII. Think, how by each other sighing, We confess'd the mutual flame, Looking, melting, panting, dyingâ Joy was then too weak a name! VIII. Think on these, and never yield thee To a heart less true than mine; Then shall heav'n's bright angels shield thee, As a being half-divine! VERSES FOR THE NEW-YEAR 1762 Still as emerges from the womb of time, Each circling year, you claim our humble rhyme; But where's the muse whose fiery numbers best, Shall rouze heroic ardor in each breast? To wing the flight where conquest leads the way, Transcends our song, and mocks the feeble lay. Such themes sublime best suit a rapt'rous lyre, And bards transported with poetic fireâ Yet when inspir'd with Britain's glorious fame, What bosom glows not with the hallow'd flame? When angry Gallia pour'd her hostile train, Intent on plunder, o'er th' Atlantic main; Strangers to arms, we knew no murd'rous art, Nor crimson faulchion, nor the pois'nous dart, From earliest youth, instructed to abhor The deadly engines of destructive war; The cannon's sound, as dire assail'd our ears, As Jove's red thunder, when he shakes the spheres. Yet to our aid when mighty Brunswick came, It kindled in each breast the martial flame; Undaunted as our warlike troops advance, To walls, inglorious, shrink the sons of France; Their cities storm'd, their chiefs in fetters bound, And their proud ramparts levell'd with the ground. O'er this new world, thus has Britannia's arms Restor'd lost peace, and exil'd war's alarms; Again rich commerce crowns the merchant's toil, And smiling Ceres paints the pregnant soil. Thus the good shepherd, when he views from far The deadly wolves beset his fleecy care, Quick to their help his guardian crook he wields, And soon the prowling throng is scatter'd o'er the fields. Yet not to us is Britain's care confin'd, Her fame is wafted to remotest Ind; By justice call'd, her chiefs, with matchless swords, Have humbled mighty Asia's proudest lords; Far distant scenes her martial deeds proclaim, And Pondicherry bows to Britain's name. See the sad chance of all-destructive warâ See Lally captiv'd at the victor's car; Lally, whose soul the madd'ning furies claim, And curs'd with longings for the voice of fame. So when a tyger, flush'd with reeking blood, Ramps o'er the plains, and tears the leafy wood, A lion spies him from his secret cave, Bursts from his stand, to seize th' insulting slave; Then hunts him, gen'rous, from the neighb'ring fields, And peace and safety to the forest yields. O'er Europe too, great George's arms prevail, And on its seas his fleets triumphant sail; Witness Belleisle, around whose wave-worn shore His navies ride, and his loud cannons roar. Oh! could we boast the seeds of epic song, Immortal Frederick should the verse prolong; The chief should shine, inclos'd with fields of dead, And guardian-angels hov'ring round his head; There, in dread chains, the barb'rous Russ should bow, And here, submissive, kneel th' Hungarian foe; There should be seen to bend, the sons of Gaul, Here lesser troops, his enemies, should fall. Thus a firm rock, begirt with raging waves, Stands the fierce charge, tho' all the tempest raves; Now round his summit dash the broken tides, And vainly beat his adamantine sides! But these we leave to deck th' historic page, And wake the wonder of a future age. Now let our muse the Paphian trumpet blow, Beauty's the theme, and melting strains shall flow. See Neptune, mounting with his nereid train, To smooth the surface of the azure main; As conscious of his charge, he joys to please The beauteous Charlotte, mistress of the seas! The jovial sailors ply their shining oars, And now they reach fair Albion's white-cliff shores; With warbling flutes, and hautboy's pleasing sound, They spread sweet music's silver notes around. On Cydnus stream, so once array'd was seen Fair Cleopatra, Egypt's beauteous Queen. But here we fix, rejoic'd to see you blest, And Britain's glory in each clime confest! N. B. The New-Year's Verses for 1763, are omitted, the substance of them being included in the Poem, entitled, Heroic Stanzas on the successes of 1762, p. 64, &amp;c. An ODE, On completing my One and Twentieth Year of Age. Father Time. of old oblivion, hail! Restrain thy swift-revolving glass; If soothing verse can ought avail, To charm thy moments as they pass. Still shall I let thee onward glide, To waft me down thy boundless tide, And unimprov'd remain my soul, When twenty-one quick summers from me thou hast stole? Adieu! amusements of my youth, My childhood and my boyish days! For virtue, probity, and truth, I quit my sports and frolic lays! Yet will remembrance bring to view, The years, in playful bliss, that flew, When careless of the passing hours, My whistle sweet I blew, or cull'd the muse's flow'rs! Then oft in Schuylkill's silver wave, Or Delaware's majestic tide, My limbs, delighted, would I lave, Or thro' the foamy billow's glide; Then chase the plover o'er the brake, Or treach'ry cast along the lake, Pleas'd to delude the finny fry, The perch with glittering scales, or trout of golden dye. Oft too, as Sol's resplendent ray With ardour beam'd thro' Cancer's sign, Would I the river's margent stray, Or on its velvet brink recline. Then would Fancy ope her treasures, Pouring on the mind new pleasures, Unlocking all her fairy scenes Of gay enamell'd groves and sweet Elysian greens. How would she then uncurtain fate, And snatch the soul to yonder sky, Events unknown to man create, And read conceal'd futurity? Or, ages old revolving o'er, Their worthies place my eyes before; Hero or patriot, saint or sage, Or who e'er smote the lyre with bold poetic rage. Flush'd with these glowing visions bright, What noble frenzy seiz'd the soul! Each phantom then of dear delight Would round the impassion'd eye-balls roll; Then o'er my temples oft the muse Vouchsaf'd to shed nectareous dews; How would I eye her ivy crown, And pant, in youthful heat, for deathless fair renown? But hence, ye dear delusions all, 'Tis time I tear you from my breast; Methinks! I hear sweet Reason call, âBe not with empty dreams possest!â Away, ye pleasing shades away, I brook no longer fond delayâ Reluctant still ye from me fly, Your airy forms I see yet flit before my eye! But come, thou habitant of heav'n! Inspirer of each gallant deed; Virtue, bright queen, to whom 'tis given The soul for purer joys to breed; High-arch'd, o'er yon cerulean plain, Sublimely shines thy sacred fane, The graces wait its portals nigh, Which perfect shall endure thro' vast eternity. Come, and thy gracious aid impart, Each perishing pursuit to tame; O root out folly from my heart, And thou the full possession claim. Each roving wish, each vain desire, O purge with thy celestial fire; What is the world's, the people's gaze? Hence with the bubble fame, and idle breath of praise! Whether, adown the stream of time, I pass with easy prosp'rous sails; Or o'er its waves I painful climb, Forlorn and toss'd by stormy gales; Still let me check the wanton breeze, Nor be absorb'd in slothful ease; But stedfast steer, when tempests rise That rend my shatter'd bark, or mount it to the skies. So come what will, the adverse scene, Or fortune's gay alluring smile, Still shall I keep my soul serene, Superior to all sinful guile; Then, whether Fate's resistless shears, Shall clip my thread in ripen'd years; Or, in my Prime, my doom be spoke, Undaunted shall I yield, and fearless meet the stroke. HEROIC STANZAS, On the Successes of his Majesty's Arms, and the Greatness of the English Nation; 1762. I. Hail sacred muse! thou harbinger of fame, To Britain's glory sound the lofty rhime; A pleasing task her greatness to proclaim, And stamp her honours on the page of time. II. For sure, the praises of her warlike train, To the harmonious deathless lyre belong; For them, sweet Clio, raise the rapt'rous strain, And the rich tide of music pour along. III. As when the monarchs of the bestial race, Triumphant, rove the sterile Lybian sand; The tyger fierce, and lordly pard they chase, Nor dare the trembling flocks their rage withstand; IV. Or, as the sovereigns of the briny flood, From shore to shore, imperial, cleave their way; Before them fly the fearful finny brood, And all confess their wide-extended sway; [V.] So when Britannia lifts her glitt'ring spear, Her ensigns blazing o'er th' embattl'd field; Heart-struck with awe, and chill'd with instant fear, Her foes inglorious fly, or trembling yield. VI. Or if some Blake her navies, vengeful, lead O'er the wide bosom of the surging wave; At her red flag, her en'mies, fill'd with dread, Shrink to their ports, or find a wat'ry grave. VII. Not Carthage old, for opulence renown'd, Nor Tyre, long noted for her purple dye; Nor aught that in th' historic page is found, With Britain's isle in wealth and strength can vie. VIII. Her's is fair Commerce to earth's distant end, Whether rich India yields her spicy store, Or Persian looms their silken beauties blend, Or mines Peruvian give the glitt'ring ore. IX. True to her ports, her num'rous vessels bear The costly freight from each prolific soil; Soft Persia's silks, and India's spice, we share, And gold Peruvian gain without the toil. X. Well doth Britannia the fair path pursue, Which ancient Rome with glory trod before; Abroad, each haughty tyrant to subdue, At home, t'encrease each happy subject's store. XI. Won by the valour of her martial bands, Lo! this new world boasts her auspicious name; Scant are the tracts the lordly Gaul commands, And lessen'd proud Iberia's ample claim. XII. Thro' yon fair isles that grace the western main, Like gems bespangling Neptune's azure vest, Or stars that deck the blue etherial plain, The feats of British heroes are confest. XIII. Struck with the thought, I feel unusual fire, When Martinico is the glorious themeâ Heroic deeds heroic songs inspire, And fill the bard with all the warrior's flame. XIV. See the brave youths, as breathes the trump of war, Tremendous, rushing on the armed foe; With mingled shouts they wield the deadly spear, And o'er the field the crimson torrents flow. XV. Th' intrepid chiefs their fiery steeds impel, Where glows the fury of the battle dire, Where shrill-voic'd clamour lifts her stunning yell, And ghastly terror rolls his eyes of fire. XVI. Th' astonish'd foes, as Monckton's bands advance, Fly to the hills, or shrink to dreary caves; O'er them black horror shakes his iron lance, And desolation her dread banner waves. XVII. So when the princely eagles sail the sky, If aught of meaner fowl oppose their flight, Soon hurled headlong from the realms on high, Vanquish'd, they seek to hide their heads in night. XVIII. Nor stop we yet the current of our verse, Still other heroes claim our rapt'rous lays; Brave Albemarle's exploits, O muse! rehearse, And waft, to distant times, his well-earn'd praise. XIX. Let youths unborn say how th' Iberian fled, Before th' British chieftan's conqu'ring host; How, o'er the field, Havannah's pride was spread, And Moro's ramparts levell'd with the dust. XX. Nor blush, O muse! thy chaplet to bestow On him who led th' unhappy sons of Spain; Be virtue honour'd, or in friend or foe, Or in Britannia's, or Iberia's, train. XXI. Thus fought Rome's champion, Africanus bold, And thus the dauntless Hannibal withstood; Till Latian Ardor, Punic rage, control'd, And drench'd the fields with Carthaginian blood. XXII. Thus shine the acts of George's glorious day, Illustrious Prince, with early honours crown'd; Ordain'd by heav'n a matchless race to sway, In arms victorious, as in arts renown'd! XXIII. Give way ye wonders of an ancient date! Enough have liv'd old Cressy and Poitiers; Henry and Edward long have shone in state, And Alfred's name subdu'd a waste of years. XXIV. These once o'er Europe spread their glories wideâ But now new worlds our Monarch's sceptre own, And tho' the deep his distant realms divide, In ev'ry subject's heart is fix'd his throne. XXV. Happy this America.Tract of rich productive soil (No more the dwelling of a savage race) Where golden harvests crown the peasant's toil, And cheerful plenty gladdens ev'ry face. XXVI. But happier still, if war's sad scenes were o'er, And widows ceas'd to mourn their husbands slain; When Peace shall spread her reign from shore to shore, And orphans for their sires no more complain. XXVII. Then might the Muses (sweet celestial Maids!) In this fair land vouchsafe to fix their seat; Nor leaving A city in BÅotia, at the foot of Parnassus.ThespiÃ¦'s ever-pleasing shades, Would the harmonious Sisters then regret. XXVIII. Much boots it us to court their sacred lore, To gen'rous deeds to animate the soul, The sage instruction o'er the mind to pour, And all the giddy passions to control; XXIX. To brand proud Folly, and bold Vice to shame, To teach that Wealth is but a transient joy, To shew that Honour is the road to fame, And Virtue is true bliss, without alloy. XXX. Such are the maxims which the sacred Nine Delight to warble o'er the deathless lyre; Such are the garlands they delight to twine; Then hither haste ye soul-exalting Choirâ AN EXERCISE; CONTAINING, A DIALOGUE AND ODE On OCCASION of the PEACE. Performed at the Public Commencement in the College of Philadelphia, May 17th, 1763. Oh! stretch thy reign, fair Peace! from shore to shore, 'Till conquest cease, and slav'ry be no more; 'Till the freed Indians, in their native groves, Reap their own fruits and woo their fable loves. Pope. Pacatumque reget patriis virtutibus orbem. Virg. A DIALOGUE, &amp;c. HORATIO, PALEMON, PHILANDER. Horatio. When flourish'd Athens with the Grecian reign, And liv'd her heroes, an illustrious train! When by her arms each neighb'ring state was sway'd And kings an homage to her warriors paid; E'en then those chiefs, with rev'rent awe ador'd The fane of Pallas more than Mars's sword; (And Latium's lords, who all the world subdu'd, Low'r'd their proud This passage alludes to an incident which Pliny informs us of, that when Pompey was about to enter the house of Posidonius, a man renown'd for his profession of philosophy, he forbad the lictor to strike the door, according to custom; and he to whom the east and the west had submitted, lowered his fasces to the gate of letters. fasces to the learn'd and good;) And with less glory in the rolls of fame, Shines ev'ry hero's than each sage's name. Hail blest Ilissus! in whose sacred shade, The muses warbled and the graces stray'd; There the deep Stagirite his pupils taught, And Plato lay intranc'd in heav'nly thought. This joyful day, in miniature hath shew'd, Scenes that enraptur'd Athens would have view'd; Science triumphant! and a land refin'd, Where once rude ign'rance sway'd th' untutor'd mind; Of uncouth forms no more the dark retreat, Transform'd to virtue's and the muse's seat. Welcome! thrice welcome, ye who grace our dome, To Wisdom's schools so throng'd the sons of Rome; To fire their youth, and nurse their rising taste! So the wise Greeks the fair Lyceum grac'd, Come, then, my friends, your notes mellifluous pour, And the soft soul of harmony explore; With melting strains the happy day prolong, What more enchanting than the charms of song? Palemon. Joyous we join thee in the choral lay, To add new transports to this blissful day; To trace the muses to their hallow'd spring, Catch the sweet sounds, and as they fire us, sing. The pleasing theme, Philander, shall be thine, To wake the raptures of th' immortal Nine; Say, in thy breast what sprightly thoughts arise, Illume thy face, and kindle in thine eyes? Philander. Not with more pleasure o'er the fragrant lawn Sports the fleet hare, or bounds the exulting fawn, When to black storms succeeds the solar ray, And gilds each beauty of the smiling day, Than my heart gladdens at the dawn of peace, As wrath subsides, and war's loud tumults cease. George gave the wordâand bade mankind reposeâ Contending Monarchs blush'd that they were foes. Old warriors now with rage shall glow no more, But reap the fields their valour won before. Such is the subject which my soul enjoy'd, In my eyes sparkled, and my thought employ'd. Horatio. Auspicious theme! for which shall be display'd Th' richest chaplets of th' Aonian shade. How bright the scene! unsullied days arise, And golden prospects rush before my eyes! Hail smiling goddess in whose placid mein, Celestial bliss with every grace is seen; O'er thy smooth brow no rugged helmet frowns, An olive wreath thy shining temple crowns. Far shalt thou banish barb'rous strife and woe, With purple vengeance to the realms below. Palemon. Stern chiefs no more their crimson'd blade, shall wield, Nor deadly thunders bellow o'er the field; Satiate of war, the battle-breathing steed Peaceful shall range the grove and verdant mead; No drum shall animate the soldier's breast, Nor piercing fife arouse him from his rest; The trump shrill sounding, and the clang of arms, Shall shake the plain no more with dire alarms. Philander. The useless rampart shall its strength resign, And o'er the bastion spread the curling vine; Th' aspiring ivy round old tow'rs shall stray, And in the trenches harmless flocks shall play; The crystal streams shall flow without a stain, The groves bloom spotless, and each flow'ry plain; Countries oppress'd by war's destructive rage, Again revive to bless a milder age; In the same fields where groves of lances rose, The furrow'd grain shall golden ranks compose. Horatio. Oh haste fair peace! begin thy pleasing reign; Come, with each lovely virtue in thy train; Then pure Religion's precepts shall prevail, Impartial justice poize her balanc'd scale; Bright liberty shall wanton in the breeze, Innoxious pleasure, philosophic ease, Heart-cheering mirth, and plenty ever gay, With rosy joy shall tend thy gentle sway! Palemon. Haste then, O haste, thy soft'ning pow'r renew, Bless ev'ry clime, the old world and the new! In friendly league, unite each distant shore, And bid mankind with anger burn no more. Commerce shall then expand without control, Where coasts extend, or farthest oceans roll; These spacious realms their treasures shall unfold, And Albion's shores shall blaze with Indian gold. Philander. Hail! happy Britain, in a Sovereign blest, Who deems in Kings a virtuous name the best; Guardian of right and sacred liberty, Rome's glorious Numa shall be seen in thee; Beneath thy smile fair Science shall increase, And form one reign of Learning and of Peace. E'en we who now attempt the muse's shell, Great George's kind Alluding to his Majesty's granting and subscribing so graciously to the Brief for the establishment of the Colleges of Philadelphia and New-York.munificence can tell, Tho' far remov'd from his illustrious throne, Yet have these walls his regal bounty known. Thus universal shines the god of day, Each land enlight'ning with his genial ray. Horatio. Enough, my friends!âye sweeter numbers flow, And let the deep ton'd swelling organ blow; Ye tuneful quire, your dulcet warblings join, And sooth th' attentive soul with harmony divine. PSALM XCVII. Paraphrased. PSALM XCVII. Paraphrased. There is in no collection of devout compositions a greater diversity of matter than in the Psalms of David. They appear to have been pen'd while the author was under the immediate impression of those feelings which he so admirably describes; whether of religious pensiveness, devout contemplation, admiration of God's attributes, pious joy, gratitude, and thanksgiving, arising from the various state of his mind or temporal affairs. They are, therefore, wonderfully fitted and adapted to the case of men in general, who, at one time or other, are in some of those situations, and actuated by the same sensations: And as they are written with great fervour of spirit, solidity of understanding, strength of fancy, and a soul illuminated by divine inspiration, it is not to be wondered that they have so often charmed the best and greatest geniuses.âSundry of our most celebrated English poets have employed their pens in rendering divers of those excellent pieces into verseâand there is not a sublimer and more musical poem in the compositions of Addison, than that which is wrought out of the 19th Psalm. I have thus far premised, to induce, if possible, those youths among us, who have enjoyed the advantage of a liberal education, and have leisure for literary pursuits and a taste and capacity for poetry, which some have lately evinced, to turn their talents towards such instructive performances.âThe Holy Scriptures are the true fountain from which to extract the richest draughts of poesy, both as to dignity of matter and embellishment of figures; witness the noble use the great Milton made of them in his marvellous poems, and though few must expect to reach to such heights as did that prodigy of learning and genius, yet all, according to their ability, may follow his illustrious example; and if we would wish to excel and atchieve any thing great and laudable, we should always look to a mark superior to ourselves. The 145th psalm, in particular, one of those paraphrased below, is a most beautiful picture of the Supreme Being, whom the Psalmist extols for those amiable attributes, which most of all must affect men with joy, as subjects of God's moral government, his goodness and mercy. Such a theme needs no apology; and as to the present handling of it, if it should excite others, of a similar taste, who, like the Author, may sometimes have an hour in the country unoccupied by duty, business, or friends, which they would wish rationally to employ in such like amusements, he hopes it will plead his excuse. Exult, O earth! ye nations sound his praise, One God supreme, with pow'r unbounded sways; Offspring of nature! the glad tidings hear, Th'eternal Ruler makes the world his care; Enthron'd sublime, with awful glory crown'd, Vindictive thunders his bright seat surround; Rob'd in thick clouds his rapid lightning flies, And hurls destruction on his enemies; Celestial righteousness, with truth her own, And perfect justice form his sacred throne; This rolling ball he pour'd his light around, And the world trembled to its utmost bound; Mountains, whose brows in lofty Ã¦ther nod, Melt at the presence of th' all-potent God. Omniscient Lord! immaculate, divine, Thro' all creation's frame thy glories shine! Suns, at thy word, illume each distant pole, Earth teams with joy and azure oceans roll. Abash'd, confus'd be those who, vain, adore Idols of wood, or bend to imag'd ore; Before his throne let gods and mortals all In grateful adoration prostrate fall. The ardent strain, lo! joyous Zion heard, And Judah's nymphs their tuneful voices rear'd, Praising transported, and in sweet accord, Thy holy judgments, ever-righteous Lord. For thou, Great Monarch of this mighty Whole! Dost all the pow'rs of heav'n and earth control. Ye mortals, who to love divine aspire, From vice polluting and foul sin retire; Fix on the law of heav'n your steady gaze, And Wisdom's self shall pleas'd protect your ways. Those who thy laws, all-gracious Sire, obey, Are crown'd with bliss, in realms of endless day. Wake then, ye virtuous! wake the rapt'rous lays, Join the loud choir of universal praise! Hail! highest Sovereign! Godhead infinite! Supreme in glory, majesty and might! PSALM CXLV. Paraphrased. I. To Thee, all-bounteous Lord and King, My muse in sweetest strains shall sing; Her morning and her evening lays, Shall warble forth thy glorious praise. Nor ever shall my grateful soul, Forget thy goodness to extol. Of pow'r and wisdom, source immense! Unsearchable to mortal sense! From age to age, the human race Thro' all thy works, the God shall trace, Declaring to their progeny, The wonders of thy majesty. I too will join th' adoring throng, Thy name shall dignify my song, And with thy acts my tongue shall sound, Responsive to the world around. II. The world around with heav'n shall join, To tell that thou art love divine; Compassion, grace, and mercy sweet, Hover, like cherubs, round thy seat. And Goodness too, whose smile alone Can beautify thy awful throne; Justice, with fear, would strike us dead, But Mercy rears each sinner's head. Thy Love inspir'd the breathless clay, And man sustains from day to day; And not alone to man confin'd, It gladdens ev'ry living kind; Show'ring its blessings in each clime, Thro' all the ceaseless rounds of time; Painting the seasons as they roll, And scatt'ring bliss from pole to pole; Darting the sun's prolific beams, Filling with silver fish the streams; Giving sweet vegetation birth, And breathing fragrance o'er the earth. III. To Thee, then, let all beings bend, And shouts of joy the Ã¦ther rend. And chiefly let thy saints on high, Laud the great Sovereign of the sky; Leading on the exultant choir, In strains of rapture, words of fire, Till heav'n and earth and hell profound, With the triumphant shouts resound. Till all confess thy glorious fame, And tremblingly adore thy name; Thus ever shall thy reign endure, In endless majesty secure. IV. When trouble sinks us to the dust, To Thee, for aid, O Lord, we trust. 'Tis thine to heal affliction's smart, And raise from death the languid heart. In meagre want or poverty, To thee we lift the suppliant eye; Thy bounteous hand, profusely kind, Pours the rich banquet unconfin'd; To man and beast thou giv'st their food, While all enjoy their proper good. V. Righteous and holy is the Lord, And will to all his grace afford, To all who his great name revere, And worship him with hearts sincere. Such in his glorious courts shall dwell, And triumph over death and hell. But those who his displeasure move, Shall never share his heav'nly love. Bless then, my soul, his sacred name, And let all nature join the theme; All nature to its God shall cry, Who lives thro' vast eternity. PSALM CXXXVII. VERSIFIED. I. 'Twas on the gentle brink reclin'd, Of fair Euphrates' murm'ring wave, When Zion's fate we call'd to mind, Salt tears our languid cheeks did lave. II. There, on the willows bending low, Our untun'd joyless harps we hung; For what but grief could from us flow, When unrelenting foes among? III. Ah! how the victors mock'd our story, Exulting o'er our helpless state; Sing now, said they, of Zion's glory, And, in your mirth, forget your fate. IV. How shall we joy in land prophane, Or sound Jehovah's matchless praise? How sing the wonders of his reign, To those who slight celestial lays? V. Rather than I, in evil hour, Should cease to think of Judah's wrong, May my right arm be void of pow'r, And dumb, for ever, be my tongue. VI. Let, O Lord, thy wrath in thunder, Speak devoted Edom's ruin; Who, a-thirst for blood and plunder, Work'd fair Judah's sad undoing. VII. And thou, O Babel! doom'd to slaughter, With just return of sighs and groans! Blest, who each infant son and daughter, Shall dash for thee against the stones. To William Lauder, P. P. Pears, apples, cheese, dear Will, and wine, If thou wilt grace my house, are thine; (For these are in my pow'r. When the last ray of yon bright sun, Shall round its whirling axle run, And hasten the sixth hour. Thy wife delights in her neat home And babes, but let her boldly come, Provided she's at leisure. Thy beauteous boy shall also find, Altho' unask'd, a welcome kind, And be receiv'd with pleasure. And with thee haste the virgin Muse, And jest that laughter shall diffuse, And mirth that cheers the soul: Banish afar corroding care, Severity with gloomy air, That might our joys control. More wisely thou procrastinate These evils to a wrinkled state, When life's no more inviting: E'er age comes on, while yet thy blood Flows in a sprightly vig'rous flood, Be cheerful and delighting. Live! live, my Will, for now's the day; Time, like a current, glides away, Or th' evanescent wind; Unstaid by stout Herculean force, Nought can protract its rapid course, And fleeting moments bind. Shadows we are, or empty dust, And vapour-like dissolve we must, Nor are we more secure; Nought can escape the dreary pit But virtue and immortal wit, Which endless shall endure. A Pastoral, from the Latin of the same. On a firm rock, enroll'd in ancient fame, A city stands, and Edinburgh its name; Here came fair Phyllis from her native hills, Whose beauty all the Scottish maids excels; First of the rural nymphs in Venus' arms, Nor yet had twenty summers crown'd her charms. This lovely fair, her father's joy and pride, Once, as she heedless pass'd, Urbanus ey'd. Quick as the lightning darts from pole to pole, An instant passion fir'd his am'rous soul; With pray'rs and bribes he strove to win her mind, But she, unmov'd, his tender suit declin'd. Soon then the ruthless rocks he rov'd among, And with his plaints Arcturus' summit rung. Echo too heard his tear-exciting strain, And back resounded every groan again. Echo, says he, alone laments my woe, In hollow accents from the caves below. My pipe sad warb'ling fills the groves around, While she redoubles ev'ry plaintive sound. Ah! wretched me! I mournfully exclaim; Ah! wretched me! the vales repeat again. Alas! alas! I sigh to ev'ry shade; Alas! alas! returns the piteous Maid. Ye sunny banks that once were my delight, With precipices awful to the sight. And vales that heard the bright-hair'd Phyllis sing, What aid to me can all your beauties bring? Phyllis is gone, with her my pleasures flew, Gone, and has bid a killing long adieu. My pipe and brittle reed I'll now destroy; Phyllis is fled, the source of all my joy. Not songs, nor flocks, can now my bliss recal, Nor charming Muses, sweeter than them all. The blue-ey'd Naiads now delight no more, Nor frolic Pan that sports the mountains o'er; His idle reed no cure for me can find, Music enchants alone th' unruffl'd mind. O cruel love! and cruel oxen too, With savage rocks that never passion knew; Those ills ye feel not that my soul infest, Nor raves the furious tempest in your breast. Such as when swells old Ãtna's restless womb, And bursts the caverns of Typhean gloom, Fierce stones, and flames, and globes of fiery red, It spouts tremendous from its burning bed, And rolls the melted sulph'rous mass amain, A flaming river down Sicilia's plain. You are relentless too, my fleecy care, Ye, nor your shepherds, pity my despair. May frosts severe the cruel rocks divide, And sudden whirlwinds tear the mountain's side; May dark December reign with icy snow, And Boreas ever round the Ã¦ther blow; Let the hard earth with cold perpetual freeze. Nor ever feel the balmy-breathing breeze. And you my flock, may madness seize your joy, And dire distempers all your race destroy; Or wolves innumerable your members tear, And far disperse them through the fields and air; May the curs'd plague your watchful swains consume, Or heav'n's dread thunder speak their instant doom. But why will fancy thus wild warfare wage, And swell my sick-mind with an impious rage? How have the rocks and air arous'd my ire? Nor goats, nor sheep, nor shepherds did conspire To pain my bosom, nor to fix my fate; Why then shall harmless these deserve my hate? Oh, I repent! my furious vows recant, With all my wrathful execrating rant. For if what anger's fierce vindictive arm, Or madness' rash precipitate alarm, Should bid, and in their order be obey'd, How could I hope to see the beauteous Maid? No! let the tender blandishments of all, Unite their charms my Phyllis to recal. Let the rough thorn with fragrant roses blow, And the green earth with golden harvests glow; Let the soft air the feather'd songsters fill With wood-notes warbled from each dale and hill; Let the glad herds their joyful lowings raise, And blythsome flocks in foodful pastures graze; Ye swains, for you may pleasures new appear, And spring perpetual rule the circling year; May winter's face with lasting green be crown'd, And gentle suns enrich the fruitful ground. Thus, as he sung, the herdsmen, flocks and swains, Bedew'd their cheeks to hear his moving strains; Cupid himself (the savage archer) moan'd, And from its caves the hollow mountain groan'd. ELEGY, To the MEMORY of My beloved FRIEND, Mr. THOMAS GODFREY, Who died near Wilmington, North-Carolina, August 3d, 1763. O death! thou victor of the human frame! The soul's poor fabric trembles at thy name! How long shall man be urg'd to dread thy sway, For those whom thou untimely tak'st away? Life's blooming spring just opens to our eyes, And strikes the senses with a sweet surprize, When thy fierce arm uplifts the fatal blow That hurls us breathless to the earth below. Sudden, as darts the lightning thro' the sky, Around the globe thy various weapons fly. Here war's red engines heap the field with slain, And pallid sickness there extends thy reign; Here the soft virgin weeps her lover dead, There maiden beauty sinks the graceful head; Here infants grieve their parents are no more, There rev'rend sires their childrens' deaths deplore Here the sad friendâO! save the sacred name, Yields half his soul to thy relentless claim; O pardon, pardon the descending tear! Friendship commands, and not the muses here. O say, thou much lov'd dear departed shade, To what celestial region hast thou stray'd? Where is that vein of thought, that noble fire Which fed thy soul, and bade the world admire? That manly strife with fortune to be just, That love of praise? an honourable thirst! The Soul, alas! has fled to endless day, And left its house a mould'ring mass of clay. There, where no fears invade, nor ills molest, Thy soul shall dwell immortal with the blest; In that bright realm, where dearest friends no more Shall from each other's throbbing breasts be tore, Where all those glorious spirits sit enshrin'd, The just, the good, the virtuous of mankind. There shall fair angels in a radiant ring, And the great Son of heav'n's eternal King, Proclaim thee welcome to the blissful skies, And wipe the tears for ever from thy eyes. How did we hopeâalas! the hope how vain! To hear thy future more enripen'd strain; When fancy's fire with judgment had combin'd To guide each effort of th' enraptur'd mind. Yet are those youthful glowing lays of thine The emanations of a soul divine; Who heard thee sing but felt sweet music's dart In thrilling transports pierce his captiv'd heart? Whether soft melting airs attun'd thy song, Or pleas'd to pour the thundring verse along, Still nobly great, true offspring of the Nine, Alas! how blasted in thy glorious prime! So when first opes the eye-lids of the morn, A radiant purple does the heav'ns adorn, Fresh smiling glory streaks the skies around, And gaily silvers each enamel'd mound, Till some black storm o'erclouds the Ã¦ther fair, And all its beauties vanish into air. Stranger, who e'er thou art, by fortune's hand Tost on the baleful Carolinian strand, Oh! if thou seest perchance the Poet's grave, The sacred spot with tears of sorrow lave; Oh! shade it, shade it with ne'er-fading bays. Hallow'd's the place where gentle Godfrey lays. (So may no sudden dart from death's dread bow Far from the friends thou lov'st e'er lay thee low) There may the weeping morn its tribute bring, And angels shield it with their golden wing, Till the last trump shall burst the womb of night, And the purg'd atoms to their soul unite! October 1, 1763. TO BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, Esq; L. L. D. Occasioned by hearing him play on the Harmonica. In grateful wonder lost, long had we view'd Each gen'rous act thy patriot-soul pursu'd; Our Little State resounds thy just applause, And, pleas'd, from thee new fame and honour draws; In thee those various virtues are combin'd, That form the true pre-eminence of mind. What wonder struck us when we did survey The lambent lightnings innocently play, And down thy Alluding to his noble discovery of the use of Pointed Rods of metal for saving houses from damage by lightning. rods beheld the dreaded fire In a swift flame descendâand then expire; While the red thunders, roaring loud around, Burst the black clouds, and harmless smite the ground. Blest use of art! apply'd to serve mankind, The noble province of the sapient mind! For this the soul's best faculties were giv'n, To trace great nature's laws from earth to heav'n! Yet not these themes alone thy thoughts command, Each softer science owns thy fostering hand; Aided by thee, Urania's heav'nly art, With finer raptures charms the feeling heart; Th' Harmonica shall join the sacred choir, Fresh transports kindle, and new joys inspireâ Hark! the soft warblings, sounding smooth and clear, Strike with celestial ravishment the ear, Conveying inward, as they sweetly roll, A tide of melting music to the soul; And sure if aught of mortal-moving strain, Can touch with joy the high angelic train, 'Tis this enchanting instrument of thine, Which speaks in accents more than half divine! On the ÃOLIAN HARP. Sweet Zephyr leave th' enamel'd plain, And hither wave thy gentle wing; Would'st thou out-rival Orpheus' strain, O haste and touch this trembling string. The balmy-breathing power obeys,â 'Tis his my slender harp to claim; He comes, and o'er its bosom plays, And rapture wakes the slender frame! The tender, melting notes of love, The soul in soothing murmurs steal; Low as the languor-breathing dove, That, lonesome, coos her plaintive tale. Hark! what sounds of pleasing pain, Deep as some bleeding lovers lay, Sad as the cygnet's moving strain, When on the shore she dies away. A nobler gale now sweeps the wire, The hollow frame responsive rings, Loud as when angels strike the lyre, Sweet as the heav'nly chorus sings. And hark! the numbers roll along, Majestically smooth and clear, Like Philomel's enchanting song, The notes mellifluous pierce the ear. Thus as the varying accents flow, Each passion feels th' accordant soundâ This lifts the soul, that sinks it low, We seem to tread on fairy ground. An EPISTLE to MIRA. How slow to him who feels the smart of love Time's leaden hours to sweet possession move! His wing'd desires out-strip each tardy morn; Eager he criesâlong-wish'd for day be born, When to my heart soft vows shall Mira tie, And love's own laws the priest shall sanctify! Dull lingering days revolve, and nights succeed, And still on love's fond dreams I hapless feed. The throbs of passion, and the heart-felt pain, The hope far distant, and the longing vain; The sigh unfeigned, the bosom's troublous swellâ Ah! what are these?âsay lovers, ye can tell! What shall divide the pair whom love hath join'd, And heaven hath form'd with sympathy of mind? Shall grov'ling fortune basely interpose, To part those hearts where mutual passion glows? Forbid it love!âFor raiment, house and food, These brows shall be with honest sweat bedew'd. Early each morn I'll wake the cherub health, And cheerful industry's best prize is wealth; We'll bound our wishes in a temp'rate round, Yet shall our table be with plenty crown'd; No friend, nor stranger, will we send away Without a meal, and glass, discreetly gay; Neat elegance shall deck our little store, And fair Åconomy shall keep the door; How shall the proud with wonder then behold Our blissful lives without a hoard of gold! Oh then! my Mira, love-inspiring fair, Who with thy swain should then in bliss compare? Not only that thy beauty's pleasing charms Shall fire my panting soul with love's alarms; Nor that thy cheek which shames the peach's bloom, And ruby lips that breathe divine perfume, Enchant me all; nor yet thy spotless breast, Which gently heaves, can make me wholly blest. 'Tis that thy manners, void of guile and art, Speak the internal goodness of thy heart; 'Tis that thy sweetness heightens ev'ry grace, And dove-like innocence adorns thy face. 'Tis that thy soul is warm'd with virtue's fire, Merit can love, and real worth admire! Can view a coxcomb's tinsel and despise, And sense, without a But to the world no bugbear is so great, As want of figure and a small estate. Pope. figure, truly prize. Can with thy lover feel unfeign'd desire, And own that passion which thy charms inspire. Nor blush at these, thou dearest, lovely maid; These shall attract, when beauty's bloom shall fade; When all the radiance of thy form shall die, These, with fresh lustre, shall thy age supply; Enhance our love when sprightly youth is past, Improve with years, and all our lives shall last. AN ORATION ON SCIENCE. Spoken at a Performance of Solemn Music and Oratory, in the Hall of the College of Philadelphia. In Wisdom's lore the tender mind to frame, The youthful breast to fire with virtue's flame, The thoughts to raise, the passions to control, And plant each godlike purpose in the soul; To Science this illustrious field's assign'd, To beam the rays of knowledge o'er mankind; For this were plan'd the noble laws of art, T' unfold the embrio powers of the heart; To guide each movement to its native goal, And scan the systems of this mighty whole! Heav'n has on man the reasoning gift bestow'd, And in his breast sublime ideas sow'd; But as it fares with rich luxuriant land, When left to chance, nor till'd by culture's hand, For fragrant flowers the rankling weeds arise, Poison the plains and all their charms disguise; So when the thoughts are in a lawless state, Which in the mind's fair garden vegetate, Soon shall intentions foul pollute the breast, Like noxious weeds that flow'ry lawns infest. Not more distinguish'd in creation's chain Is man, by reason, o'er the bestial train, Than man from man, by education made, When native sense by Science is array'd, When ev'ry faculty matur'd by skill, Obeys the dictates of the sapient will; Then, led by Science, fancy wings her flight Round the wide world, or to the realms of light, Extracting wisdom from each scene below, Or soaring 'mid the radiant planets glow;â Where, wonder struck!âshe finds their sparkling rays, But bright reflections from the solar blaze! And views with steady eye those wandering stars, That fright the world with prodigies and wars! By Science youthful minds are taught to know, What to their God, their Country, Friends, they owe; Life's glorious scope, and whence it first began, What springs direct the Microcosm, Man; What bids a savage like a sage to shine, Or makes an The tyrannical King of the Hunns. Attila an Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, equally fam'd for his clemency and philosophy. Antonine; All that ennobles man's exalted race, All that Religion, Virtue, Truth, embrace! 'Tis her's with loftier feelings to inspire, And fit a mortal for the heavenly choir! VERSES, ADDRESSED TO THE TRUSTEES of the College and Academy OF PHILADELPHIA. Written and pronounced as an Exercise at the Public Commencement, May 30, 1765, on taking the Degree of M. A. in said College. 'Twas nobly done! the Muse's seat to raise In this fair land, and earn immortal praise! To civilize our first fam'd sires began, 'Twas yours to prosecute the glorious plan; They peopled deserts with unwearied toil, Establish'd laws and till'd the fruitful soil; 'Twas yours to call in each refining art, T' improve the manners and exalt the heart; To train the rising race in wisdom's lore, And teach them virtue's summit to explore. What land than this can choicer blessings claim, Where sacred liberty has fixt her name; Where o'er each field gay Plenty spreads her store, Free as yon The Delaware. river laves the winding shore; Where active Trade pours forth her jovial train O'er the green bosom of the boundless main; Where honest Industry's bright tools resound, And Peace her olive scepter waves around? To such a state fair Science to convey, And beam afar the philosophic day; To make our native treasures doubly blest, Was sure a scheme to fire each worthy breast; Was fit for gen'rous patriots to pursue, Was fit for learning's patronsâand for you! As from the east yon orb first darts his ray O'er heav'ns blue vault, and westward bends his way, So Science in the orient climes begun, And, like bright Sol, a western circuit run; From eastern realms to Greece was learning brought, What e'er Pythagoras or Cadmus taught; Her form illustrious Athens did illume, And rais'd the genius of imperial Rome; From Latium's plains she sought Britannia's shore, And bid her barb'rous sons be rude no more; Fierce nations roam'd around the rugged isle, Till Science on its fields began to smile; Fair Cam and Isis heard no muse's strains, Their shades were trod by wolves and fiercer Danes, Till with the Arts Augusta's grandeur rose, And her loud thunder shook the deep's repose. Just so, in time (if right the Muse descries) Shall this wide realm with tow'ry cities rise; The spacious Delaware, thro' future song, Shall roll in deathless majesty along; Each grove and mountain shall be sacred made, As now is Cooper's hill and Windsor's shade. Flush'd with the thought I'm borne to ages hence, The muse-wrought vision rushes on my sense. Methinks Messiah's ensign I behold In the deep gloom of yonder shades unroll'd, And hear the Gospel's silver clarion sound, Rousing with heav'nly strains the heathen round; Methinks I hear the nations shout aloud, And to the glory-beaming standard crowd; New inspirations shake each trembling frame, The Paraclete pours forth the lambent flame, In renovating streams on ev'ry soul, While through their breasts celestial transports roll. Stupendous change! methinks th' effects appear; In the dark region sacred temples rear Their lofty heads; fair cities strike my sight, And heav'n-taught Science spreads a dazzling light O'er the rough scene, where error's court was found, And red-ey'd slaughter crimson'd all the ground. O haste, blest days! till ign'rance flee the ball, And the bright rays of knowledge lighten all, Till in yon wild new seats of Science rise, And such as you the arts shall patronize! For this your names shall swell the trump of fame, And ages yet unborn your worth proclaim. EPITAPH, In MEMORY of Mrs. MARGARET ROBINSON, WIFE OF Capt. JAMES ROBINSON, Who died March 22, 1765, and was buried in St. Catharine's Church, London. Thou, who within these hallow'd walls shalt move, Know that this stone was fix'd by gen'rous love; A husband's fondest hopes beneath it rest, A wife, in whom fair virtue stood confest; In whom sweet love, and mild compassion join'd, With each soft grace that decks the female mind; A wife who never gave her husband pain, But when pale death had rank'd her with the slain! What soothing joys her goodness did impart, Ah! read them in her partner's broken heart! Think, in his grief, thou seest her virtues rise, And pity's streams shall soon o'erflow thine eyes! To CLARINDA. May 20, 1768. I. Soft breathing o'er the velvet green, Is felt the heart-reviving gale; Gay Spring unfolds the blooming scene, The budding grove and scented vale. II. The orchard's sweets, the garden's flowers, The brook that babbles thro' the plain, The bladed lawns and blossom'd bowers, The wild notes of the feather'd trainâ III. In vain their matchless charms unite, Poetic rapture to diffuse; I view them with a calm delight, But uninspir'd remains the muse. IV. Too dull I grow to sport in rhime, No rapt'rous warmth elates my soul; No more the muse's hill I climb, Nor in bright fancy's chariot roll. V. The glories of the vernal year, The lustre of the female form, Could once awake the sprightly air, And all my soul with transport warm. VI. But, now transform'd to hermit grave, These radiant prospects languid seem, I haunt no more the flow'ry cave, Nor loll aside the plaintive stream. VII. Th' enchanting pow'r of verse no more In sweet Elysium wraps my heart; O'er heaps of musty prose I pore, Forgetful of the Muse's art. VIII. What then can re-illume my breast, And light the long neglected fire, When Nature's landscape gaily drest, Can scarce a glowing thought inspire? IX. When e'en Clarinda's winning charms, But half excites the sprightly strain; Tho' form'd to raise love's soft alarms, And rank'd in beauty's lucid train. X. Yet though these flatt'ring themes no more, Allure the moral bard to stray, Still shall the Muse a theme explore, Deserving of her choicest lay. XI. Good-nature shall new string the lyre, Which marks Clarinda for her own; Clarinda's Beauty all admire, I praise her for this charm alone. THE MORNING INVITATION, To Two YOUNG LADIES at the Gloucester Spring. I. Sequester'd from the city's noise, Its tumults and fantastic joys, Fair nymphs and swains retire, Where Delaware's far rolling tide, Majestic winds by Glo'ster's side, Whose shades new joys inspire. II. There innocence and mirth resort, And round its banks the graces sport, Young love, delight and joy; Bright blushing health unlocks his springs, Each grove around its fragrance flings, With sweets that never cloy. III. Soon as from out the orient main, The sun ascends th' etherial plain, Bepearling ev'ry lawn; Wild warbling wood-notes float around, While echo doubles ev'ry sound, To hail the gladsome dawn. IV. Now Celia with thy Cloe rise, Ye fair unlock those radiant eyes, Nor more the pillow press; Now rise and taste of vernal bliss, Romantic dreams and sleep dismiss, New joys your sense shall bless. V. Whether along the velvet green, Adorning all the sylvan scene, The fair incline to stray; Where lofty trees o'ershade the wave, And Zephyrs leave their secret cave, Along the streams to play. VI. There lovely views the Delaware. river crown, Woods, meadows, ships, yon Philadelphia. spiry town, Where wit and beauty reign; Where Cloe and fair Celia's charms, Fill many a youth with love's alarms, Sweet pleasure, mix'd with pain. VII. Or whether o'er the fields ye trip, At yon salubrious The chalybeate spring near Gloucester. fount to sip, Immur'd in darksome shade; Around whose sides The laurel-leaved tulip tree. This beautiful tree is one of the greatest ornaments of the American woods, of which it is a native. magnolias' bloom, Whose silver blossoms deck the gloom, And scent the spicy glade. VIII. These are Aurora's rural sweetsâ Fresh dew-drops, flowers and green retreats, Perfume the balmy air; Rise then and greet the new-born day, Rise, fair ones, join the linnet's lay, And Nature's pleasures share. IX. So shall gay health your cheeks adorn, With blushes sweeter than the morn, And fresh as early day; And then, that Glo'ster is the place, To add to beauty's brightest grace, The world around shall say. FRAGMENTS, AND Unfinished POEMS. On TIME. O time! still urging to eternity, In thy deep womb the world's vast actions lieâ Thy hours still whirl us on in full career, Day following day, and year succeeding year; Old moments ending as the new ones riseâ For thy first child, Succession, never dies; But all things human own thy sov'reign pow'r, Just live and dieâa thousand in an hour. Kings, empires, thrones and nations fade away, And others still succeed as they decay; Fair peace and horrid war still rule by turns, With love and rage the world, alternate, burns; And thus the same rotation shall be seen, Till consummation shuts this earthly scene! What then avails t' invoke the sacred Nine, Or humbly bend us at the Muse's shrine, When we, together with our loftiest rhime, Shrink to oblivion, at one blast of Time? INTRODUCTION TO A NIGHT-PIECE. Hush'd was the air, the howling winds were still, And icy fetters bound each silver rill; Old Night her raven mantle cast around, And Spectres rose from consecrated ground; The full orb'd moon a pallid lustre shed, And o'er each scene a livelier horror spread. 'Twas then aside the frozen Delaware, (To the bleak north, her bosom, heaving, bare) Revolving various troubles in her mind, Fair Pennsylvania's genius sad reclin'd, Her olive crown, scarce cleans'd from reeking gore, She dash'd, indignant, on the flinty shore; Then, sorrowful, she turn'd her briny eyes To where her Capital's proud turrets rise. Thus, as she rested on a bank of snow, Breathing deep sighs, and lost in speechless woe; Sudden, a solemn murmur fill'd the air, And rous'd the Goddess from her trance of care.â A SEA-PIECE. I. What solemn awe pervades my wond'ring soul, While o'er the deep I cast my straining eye? Around me, waves on waves, stupendous roll, And, mounting, seem to meet the bending sky. II. Whether the rosy-fringed dawn I view, Purpling the golden east with infant light, While the red sun yet drinks the falling dew, And dissipates the lazy shades of night; III. Or whether, mounted in his glitt'ring car, He darts meridian splendor o'er the main; Or sinking softer down the western air, He clothes with crimson clouds th' etherial plain; IV. The heavens and ocean still my vision bound, Nor other object save what they dispense; Within the vast circumference is found, To charm the heart, or rouse the eager sense. V. Yet still the man, by Nature's grandeur fir'd, Whom Heav'n's inimitable works can please; Will feel his soul with gen'rous thoughts inspir'd, Struck with the pow'r that form'd those awful seas. VI. How sweet the morn, when zephyrs round us sweep, And in the east, with blushing beauty gay, Bright Sol emerging from the pearly deep, Leads on, in dazzling majesty the day? VII. The orient billows seem one living blaze; The grey mists rise, with amber skirted o'er, And float afar before the solar rays, Collecting, in their march the showery store. VIII. Along the boundless Ã¦ther, light, they sail, Remotest regions feel their kindly aid; Or, on the hills they break, or lowly vale Refresh, and fructify the thirsty glade. IX. Then, in meand'ring streams, they prattling glide, Wat'ring the green savannahs in their course; And swell the river's oft revolving tide, And mingle, foaming, with their native source. X. Oft when, in silent calm, the noon-day beam Reflects its glory down heav'n's azure steep, Through the clear waves, resplendent dolphins gleam, And whales, enormous, gambol round the deep. XI. Oft in this wat'ry region fish are found, Resembling animals of earthly form; Here, in black droves, the nimble Porpoise. sea-hogs bound, Omen to mariners of coming storm.â TO MELANCHOLY. Come, thou Queen of pensive air, In thy sable, sooted car, By two mournful turtles drawnâ Let me meet thee on yon lawn, With decent vestments wrapt around, And thy brows with cypress bound! Quickly come, thou sober dame, And thy musing Poet claim. Bear me, where thou lov'st to rove, In the deep, dark, solemn grove; Where, on banks of velvet green, Peace, with Silence, still is seen; And Leisure, at the sultry noon, On flowry carpet flings him downâ There, sweet Queen! I'll sing thy pleasures In enthusiastic measures, And sound thy praise thro' the lone vale, Responsive to the hollow gale; The murm'ring rills shall spread it round, And grottoes the wild notes rebound.â Beginning of a POEM, ON THE Passion and Resurrection of CHRIST. Now came the hour, th' important hour, When Heav'n's eternal Son, (Who deign'd the fleshly form to wear, And all our sins and troubles bear) His sacred blood for man must pour, By Satan's wiles undone. O Thou! all-hallow'd Spirit, hear! Inspirer of the prophets old, Who tun'd the royal David's ear, When thro' his breast sweet transports roll'd; Thou Paraclete divine, o'er-rule my humble lyre, And touch a mortal breast with thy celestial fire; For all in vain We wake the strain, Our gratitude to prove And sing Messiah's love, Unless thy holy flame our frozen hearts inspire.â AN INVOCATION, For the Return of Spring; March 17th, 1760. I. Ye southern gales, that fan Peruvian groves, With gentle am'rous wing, Awhile suspend your tender loves, And chide the loit'rer spring! O gently chide th' unkind delay, That keeps the nymph so long away From northern climes, whose drooping swains Long to hail her on their frozen plains. II. Where'er the ling'ring maid you find, By stream or vocal grove, Around her waist soft osiers bind That she may cease to rove. Then swiftly ply your rapid wing, The captive fair-one hither bring, That all our fields in renovated charms may smile, And flow'rs unnumber'd deck the loosen'd soil. III. All nature mourns thee, blooming fairâ No more the streams delight; No more embroider'd vales appear, To check the wand'ring sight. E'en PhÃ¦bus darts a sickly ray, And pours a dull dejected day, Refusing to dispense his splendid beams To loose the frozen glebe, and thaw the icy streams. IV. Yet sad Canadia's sons, with dread, Still court the wintry gloom; For frost and snow on them more pleasure shed, Than thy enliv'ning bloom! With eyes aghast, they view the plain Portending thy approaching reign, And wish St. Lawrence streams may never flow, But, bound in icy chains, repel their conquering foe. V. Not such the prayer of vet'ran bands Whom Wolfe to glory led, Beneath whose gallant warlike hands, The pride of Gallia bled. With ardent wish for Spring's return, And martial rage, their bosoms burn, Impatient once again the foe to meet, And, in one well-fought field, their labours to complete???? ON SOLITUDE. Hail Solitude! thou friend to virtue, hail! To me thy blissful presence oft reveal, Lest worldly scenes my foolish heart ensnare, And all my hopes of bliss be lost in air! The noblest heroes e'er the sun survey'd, With joy approach'd thy venerable shade; And far from wishing for the toys of state Or mean amusements of the vulgar great, Possess'd their minds in philosophic case, Till nature fix'd a period to their days; Then void of fear, each anxious thought supprest, They gain'd, with joy, the land of endless rest. When Cynthia, peerless regent of the night, Ascends her polish'd car divinely bright; Often, with care opprest, I pensive stray, Where Schuylkill winds his solitary way; Beneath some mountain's wild romantic brow, Whose pendent cliffs alarm the flood below, I lay me downât'indulge the solemn hour, And yield myself to contemplation's pow'r; I feel the goddess rouse my slumb'ring soul, And all my vain and wand'ring thoughts control; I seem to breathe on consecrated ground, And wisdom speaks in ev'ry object round; Each scene delightsâthe breeze that gently roves, In hollow murmurs thro' th' illumin'd groves, The moon-light dancing down the trembling stream, Or darting thro' the trees with fainter gleamâ These and a thousand charms, alternate rise, To wake sweet musing, and to feast the eyes! And hark! from yon tall mountain's cloud-wrapt brow, What notes majestic hither seem to flow! Angelic voices, lutes melodious, join, To praise the maker of this frame divineâ With voice distinct, they say, or seem to say, âWho gave yon glorious orbs their bright array? âWhat careful hand their golden lamps supplies, âOr marks their courses thro' yon azure skies? âWhat wond'rous pow'r, amid the pathless plain, âPrevents confusion in their sparkling train? â'Tis God aloneââthe heavenly chorus singsâ â'Tis God aloneââthe wide empyrean ringsâ If heavenly hosts with such devotion burn, What equal honours can frail man return? Yet, wake my soul, prepare the grateful lay, In emulation of those sons of day; Whose glorious bands, unseen by mortal eye, Visit this earth, or hover in the sky; For saints expiring, tune the silver lyre, And thro' their doubting souls sweet confidence inspire. Hail! all-improving sacred solitude! Thou best companion of the wise and good! Why should vain man from thy blest presence run, And all self-converse, with such caution, shun? Can sensual pleasures so o'erwhelm the mind As not to leave one trace of thought behind? Alas! they canâand hence, that strange delight In all that's wicked, empty, vain and light. Thy faithful mirror no false charms bestows, But, in just colours, each affection shows If pure the mind, new transports seize the breast, And give a foretaste of celestial rest; But if foul vice should in the glass appear, The conscious heart is fill'd with black despair???? END OF THE FRAGMENTS. ORPHEUS AND EURYDICE. Orpheus, of old, as poets tell, Took a fantastic trip to hell, To seek his Wifeâas wisely guessing, She must be there, since she was missing. Downward he journey'd, wond'rous gay, And, like a lark, sang all the way; The reason was, or they bely'd him, His yoke-fellow was not beside him. Whole grottoes, as he pass'd along, Danc'd to the music of his song. So have I seen, upon the plains, A fiddler captivate the swains, And make them caper to his strains. To Pluto's court at last he came, Where the god sat enthron'd in flame, And ask'd if his lost love was there, Eurydice, his darling fair? The fiends, who list'ning round him stood, At the odd question laugh'd aloudâ âThis must some mortal madman be, âWe fiends are happier far than he.â But music's sounds o'er hell prevail; Most mournfully he tells his tale, Sooths with soft arts the monarch's pain, And gets his bargain back againâ âThy pray'rs are heard,â grim Pluto cries, âOn this condition take thy prizeâ âTurn not thine eyes upon the fair, âIf once thou turn'st, she flies in air.â In am'rous chat they climb th' ascent, Orpheus âNamque hanc dederat Proserpina legem., as order'd, foremost went; (Tho' when two lovers downwards steer, The man, as fit, falls in the rear.) Soon the fond fool âHeu, victusque animi, respexit. See Virg. Georg. IV. line 556, &amp;c. where this story is beautifully told. turns back his head, Assoon in air his spouse was fled. If 'twas design'd, 'twas wond'rous well; But, if by chance, more lucky still. Happy the man, all must agree, Who once from wedlock's noose gets free; But he who from it twice is freed, Has most prodigious luck indeed! An ODE. WRITTEN AT G?ME PARK. I. How breathes the morn her incense round, And sweetens ev'ry sylvan scene? Wild warblings thro' the groves resound, And op'ning flow'rs bedeck the green. II. Bright o'er the hills the solar ray Its gaily trembling radiance spreads, Pleas'd on the glassy fount to play, And pearl the dew-bespangled meads. III. How sweet this hour the fields to rove, When Nature sheds her charms profuse; Or hide me in th' embow'ring grove, And court the thought-inspiring Muse? IV. What joy, aside the plaintive fount, Dissolv'd in pleasing thought, to stray, And swift on Fancy's wing to mount, And tread the bright ethereal way? V. Thus musing o'er the charming plains, (Where G?me the just and good retires, Where Laura breathes her tender strains, Whom ev'ry graceful muse inspires) VI. Young Damon pour'd his artless lay, Beam'd from imagination's light, When sudden from the realms of day, A form of glory struck his sight. VII. Wisdom's grave matron, from the skies, Before the trembling youth appear'd, (Tho' seen but by poetic eyes) And thus to speak the dame was heard. VIII. Would'st thou, O youth, these scenes enjoy, The solemn grove and fragrant lawn, And pleasure taste without alloy, Wake jolly Health at early dawn. IX. Banish Ambition from thy breast, And sordid-minded Av'rice fly; Nor let pale Spleen thy ease infest, Nor gloomy Sorrow cloud thine eye. X. Thy heart an off'ring nobly yield At Virtue's high exalted shrine; Thy soul let Resolution shield, And e'er to dove-ey'd Peace incline. XI. Let Cheerfulness, with placid mein, Hold a firm empire o'er thy heart, And sweet Content shall ceaseless reign, And never-ending bliss impart. XII. Then shall th' immortal Nine unfold What sweets the sylvan scenes can give; In heav'n thy name shall be enroll'd, And others learn like thee to live. Some Lines out of Mr. POPE's ELOISE TO ABELARD. âHow happy is the blameless vestal's lot? âThe world forgetting, by the world forgot; âEternal sun-shine of the spotless mind; âEach prayer accepted and each wish resign'd; âLabour and rest, that equal periods keep; âObedient slumbers, that can wake and weep; âDesires compos'd, affections ever even; âTears that delight, and sighs that waft to heaven. âGrace shines around her with serenest beams, âAnd whisp'ring angels prompt her golden dreams. âFor her the spouse prepares the bridal ring, âFor her white virgins hymeneals sing; âFor her th' unfading rose of Eden blooms, âAnd wings of seraphs shed divine perfumes; âTo sounds of heav'nly harps she dies away, âAnd melts in visions of eternal day. A PARODY On the foregoing Lines, by a Lady, assuming the Name of LAURA. How happy is the country Parson's lot? Forgetting Bishops, as by them forgot; Tranquil of spirit, with an easy mind, To all his Vestry's votes he sits resign'd: Of manners gentle, and of temper even, He jogs his flocks, with easy pace, to heaven. In Greek and Latin, pious books he keeps; And, while his Clerk sings psalms, heâsoundly sleeps. His garden fronts the sun's sweet orient beams, And fat church-wardens prompt his golden dreams. The earliest fruit, in his fair orchard, blooms; And cleanly pipes pour out tobacco's fumes. From rustic bridegroom oft he takes the ring; And hears the milk-maid plaintive ballads sing. Back-gammon cheats whole winter nights away, And Pilgrim's Progress helps a rainy day. N. B. The foregoing Parody occasioned the following epistolary contest, and poetical Raillery, between our Author and Laura. An EPISTLE To LAURA, on her PARODY. I lately saw, no matter where, A parody, by Laura fair; In which, beyond dispute, 'tis clear, She means her country friend to jeer; For, well she knows, her pleasing lays, (Whether they banter me or praise, Whatever merry mood they take) Are welcome for their author's sake. Tobacco vile, I never smoak, (Tho' Laura loves her friend to joke) Nor leave my flock all in the lurch, By being lullaby'd in church; But, change the word from clerk to priest, Perhaps I lull my sheep to rest. As for the table of Back-gammon, 'Tis far beyond the reach of Damon; But, place right gammon on a table, And then to play a knifeâI'm able. âHow happy is my lot,â you say, Because from Bishops far away! Happy I am, I'll not deny, But then it is when you are nigh; Or gently rushes o'er my mind Th' idea of the nymph refin'd; In whom each grace and virtue meet, That render woman-kind complete; The sense, the taste, the lovely mien Of Stella, pride of Patrick's Dean. O Laura! when I think of this, And call you friendâ'tis greater bliss. Than all the âfat church-wardens schemes,â Which rarely âprompt my golden dreams;â Yet, if the happiness, fair maid, That sooths me in the silent shade, Should, in your eye, appear too great, Come, take it allâand share my fate! LAURA's ANSWER. Laura to Damon health doth send, And thus salutes her saucy friend. Because you would exert your wit, You take the cap ne'er made to fit; And then your sprighly verse display, To prove me out in every wayâ But I'll proceed, nor care one farthing; Nor shall you make me sue for pardon, Nor once recant what I asserted, Tho' from my pen in haste it flirted. Truly, because you do inherit Some portion of the Dean's queer spirit, You want to prove, in wondrous haste, That Laura too has Stella's taste; As if it must directly follow, Since you are favour'd by Apollo, That he his choicest gifts must send, To ev'ry scribbling female friend. I thank you, sirâyou're wond'rous kind! But think me not so vain or blind, As to believe the pretty things, Your muse, with ease, at Laura flings. 'Tis true, the moments I beguil'd, And at a country parson smil'd; Unhappy me! who ne'er could dream, That you should think yourself the theme; Unless my muse, thro' rank ill-nature, Had turn'd what follows into satyrâ âA manner frank and debonnair, âA heart that's open and sincere, âPlain sense, strip'd of pedantic rules, âAnd formal precepts, hatch'd in schools; âFirm honesty without parade, âSimplicity in truth array'd; âA sprightly vein of humour too, âKnown only by a favour'd few.â Had Madam Muse, in spleen or spight, Plac'd all those graces in a light, To make us laugh, more than admireâ Then Damon might have taken fire, And said,â'tis past dispute and clear, I meant my country friend to jeer. Yet, e'er I closeâallow me time, But just to add another rhyme. Since I esteem your bliss so great, In pennance you will chuse a mate, And tell meââI may share your fate!â The scheme is good, I must confess, If you have bliss, to make it less! Yet take a hint, before resolv'd, And in the dragging chain involv'd. While youthful joys around you shine, Haste not to bend at Hymen's shrine; Let friendship, gen'rous friendship, be The bond to fetter you and me, Vestal, Platonicâwhat you will, So virtue reigns with freedom still. But if, in matrimonial noose, You must be boundâand have a spouse; The faithful rib that heav'n shall fend, I'll fondly greet, and call her friend ??? To LAURA, In REPLY to the ABOVE. Laura, for once excuse, I pray, The pertness of a rural lay; And I will ne'er again offend, Or need the name of saucy friend; Stella, (for now I see it clearly, Who loves a little mischief dearly) Resolv'd to carry a gay farce on, Told me I was the country parson, Described in your melodius strain; To which I now return again. I, like my namesake, without Nathaniel. guile, Thought in my turn that I might smile, So seis'd my pen, in a brisk sally, Determin'd to pay off the tally; And, in a fit of warm regard, Dropt a few wordsâquite off my guard; For which I Laura's mercy crave, And shall remain her humble slaveâ She's pleas'd to say, that âI inherit, âSome portion of the Dean's queer spirit.â If aught in me was ever seen, Resembling Patrick's boasted Dean; It was his faults, I fearârank pride, Which, for my life, I cannot hide, And one less vain than Swiftâor me, Might e'en both proud and saucy be, When such fine things of him are said By Laura, the harmonious maid; Yet still her compliments, I fear, Are only sent her friend to jeer. Or sugar o'er a little smart And close the bleedings of a heartâ Thus, without cause, when children cry, And put their finger in their eye, Kind mamma gives them aught that's handy, Cakes, marmalade, or sugar-candy. Fair Laura hintsâthe hint I take. And honour for its mistress' sakeâ Yet when great Cupid is inclin'd, To fix his empire o'er my mind, A silken cord, no âdragging chain,â Shall lead me to his sacred fane; For none, I trust, shall e'er discover, In me aught like the whimp'ring lover; The fault'ring voice, the sigh of care, The languid look, the dying air. When abject thus behaves the muse, May I kind Laura's friendship lose, That friendship which I dearer hold, Than silver heaps or shining gold. And now, farewell!âmay ev'ry hour Fresh happiness on Laura pourâ Whether in sacred wedlock join'd, Or to the Vestal state inclin'd; May constant joys before her rise, Till, for low earth, she gains the skies! VERSES ON THREE LADIES, Who filled up Filling up blank rhimes is often a trial of skill among the French; that is, the rhimes, or final words of the different lines, are given, and the remainder is to be filled up so as to make sense and poetry. Les Bouts Rimez and desired the Author to decide which was best. When the Juno. wife of old Jove, with the child of his Pallas. brain, And his Venus. daughter so fair, attack'd the young swain; Poor Paris was sadly bewilder'd to find, To which of the fair-ones his heart was inclin'd; Till at length, from his quiver, a mischievous shaft, Little Cupid produc'dâat which the boy laugh'dâ Then gave it to Venus, who straight let it fly, And sudden as light'ning reach'd Paris's eye; For the queen of sweet smiles the shepherd then sighs, And yields to bright Venus the laurel and prize. Thus Damon was smitten with rapture and joy When your contest, fair ladies, his thoughts did employ. The praise of Madona vermilion'd his face With blushesâfor want of that virtue and grace, Which her good-natur'd pen could so easily paint, Tho' the portrait was bright and original taint. Next Laura, accomplish'd in head and in heart, Fair daughter of Clio produc'd her sweet art, Apollo himself, I fancy, with zeal, Would wish to imprint the poetical seal. The third tuneful lady that makes up the choir, Entranc'd my poor brain, and my heart set on fireâ Ah, Clara! I fear the arrow of Cu', Instead of the muse's soft weapon you drew; Or why through my breast do such ecstacies roll, And the throbs of sweet passion beat high in my soul. In the name of Apollo, a sprig of green bays I grant to each lady for her witty lays. ANSWER BY LAURA, One of the THREE LADIES above mentioned. I. 'Tis true that Paris was a beau, But yet was not polite; For he on Ida's top could show To two bright nymphs a slight. II. Three fair ones begg'd him to decide Which was the greatest beautyâ He might have sooth'd each lady's pride And yet have done his duty. III. To one he might have given shape, And piercing eyes to t'other; Then had he made a good escape, And sav'd a mighty pother. IV. Minerva then had dwelt in peace, And Juno, without passion, Have caus'd a ten years war to cease, And sav'd old Priam's nation. V. Young Damon, in a like dispute, Took care to shun a quarrel; He try'd each lady's taste to suit, And gave to each the laurel. VI. Had one alone obtain'd the bays, And wit's bright prize have borne, The other two, throughout their days, The willow must have worn.</field>
