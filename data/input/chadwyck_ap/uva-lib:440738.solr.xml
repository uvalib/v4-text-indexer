      <field name="fulltext">SEEKING FOR HAPPINESS Seeking for happiness we must go slowly; The road leads not down avenues of haste; But often gently winds through by ways lowly, Whose hidden pleasures are serene and chaste. Seeking for happiness we must take heed Of simple joys that are not found in speed. Eager for noon-time's large effulgent splendour, Too oft we miss the beauty of the dawn, Which tiptoes by us, evanescent, tender, Its pure delights unrecognised till gone. Seeking for happiness we needs must care For all the little things that make life fair. Dreaming of future pleasures and achievements We must not let to-day starve at our door; Nor wait till after losses and bereavements Before we count the riches in our store. Seeking for happiness we must prize this— Not what will be, or was, but that which is. In simple pathways hand in hand with duty (With faith and love, too, ever at her side), May happiness be met in all her beauty The while we search for her both far and wide. Seeking for happiness we find the way Doing the things we ought to do each day. THE RIVER OF SLEEP There are curious isles in the River of Sleep, Curious isles without number. We'll visit them all as we leisurely creep Down the winding stream whose current is deep, In our beautiful barge of Slumber. The very first isle in this wonderful stream Quite close to the shore is lying, And after a supper of cakes and cream We come to the Night-Mare-Isle with a scream, And hurry away from it crying. And next is the Island-of-Lullaby, And every one there rejoices. The winds are only a perfumed sigh, And the birds that sing in the treetops try To imitate Mothers' voices. A little beyond is the Isle-of-Dreams; Oh, that is the place to be straying. Everything there is just as it seems; Dolls are real and sunshine gleams, And no one calls us from playing. And then we come to the drollest isle, And the funniest sounds come pouring Down from its borderlands once in a while, And we lean o'er our barge and listen and smile; For that is the Isle-of-Snoring. And the very last isle in the River of Sleep Is the sunshiny Isle-of-Waking. We see it first with our eyes a-peep, And we give a yawn—then away we leap, The barge of Slumber forsaking. THE THINGS THAT COUNT Now, dear, it isn't the bold things, Great deeds of valour and might, That count the most in the summing up of life at the end of the day. But it is the doing of old things, Small acts that are just and right; And doing them over and over again, no matter what others say; In smiling at fate, when you want to cry, and in keeping at work when you want to play— Dear, those are the things that count. And, dear, it isn't the new ways Where the wonder-seekers crowd That lead us into the land of content, or help us to find our own. But it is keeping to true ways, Though the music is not so loud, And there may be many a shadowed spot where we journey along alone; In flinging a prayer at the face of fear, and in changing into a song a groan— Dear, these are the things that count. My dear, it isn't the loud part Of creeds that are pleasing to God, Not the chant of a prayer, or the hum of a hymn, or a jubilant shout or song. But it is the beautiful proud part Of walking with feet faith-shod; And in loving, loving, loving through all, no matter how things go wrong; In trusting ever, though dark the day, and in keeping your hope when the way seems long— Dear, these are the things that count. LIMITLESS When the motive is right and the will is strong There are no limits to human power; For that great Force back of us moves along And takes us with it, in trial's hour. And whatever the height you yearn to climb, Though it never was trod by the foot of man, And no matter how steep—I say you can, If you will be patient—and use your time. CERTITUDE There was a time when I was confident That God's stupendous mystery of birth Was mine to know. The wonder of it lent New ecstasy and glory to the earth. I heard no voice that uttered it aloud, Nor was it written for me on a scroll; Yet, if alone or in the common crowd, I felt myself a consecrated soul. My child leaped in its dark and silent room And cried, ‘I am,’ though all unheard by men. So leaps my spirit in the body's gloom And cries, ‘I live! I shall be born again.’ Elate with certitude towards death I go, Nor doubt, nor argue, since I know, I know! THREE SOULS Three Souls there were that reached the Heavenly Gate, And gained permission of the Guard to wait. Barred from the bliss of Paradise by sin, They did not ask or hope to enter in. ‘We loved one woman (thus their story ran); We lost her, for she chose another man. So great our love, it brought us to this door; We only ask to see her face once more. Then will we go to realms where we belong, And pay our penalty for doing wrong.’ ‘And wert thou friends on earth?’ (The Guard spake thus.) ‘Nay, we were foes; but Death made friends of us. The dominating thought within each Soul Brought us together, comrades, to this goal, To see her face, and in its radiance bask For one great moment—that is all we ask. And, having seen her, we must journey back The path we came—a hard and dangerous track.’ ‘Wait, then,’ the Angel said, ‘beside me here, But do not strive within God's Gate to peer Nor converse hold with Spirits clothed in light Who pass this way; thou hast not earned the right.’ They waited year on year. Then, like a flame, News of the woman's death from earth-land came. The eager lovers scanned with hungry eyes Each Soul that passed the Gates of Paradise. The well-beloved face in vain they sought, Until one day the Guardian Angel brought A message to them. ‘She has gone,’ he said, ‘Down to the lower regions of the dead; Her chosen mate went first; so great her love She has resigned the joys that wait above To dwell with him, until perchance some day, Absolved from sin, he seeks the Better Way.’ Silent, the lovers turned. The pitying Guard Said: ‘Stay (the while his hand the door unbarred), There waits for thee no darker grief or woe; Enter the Gates, and all God's glories know. But to be ready for so great a bliss, Pause for a moment and take heed of this: The dearest treasure by each mortal lost Lies yonder, when the Threshold has been crossed, And thou shalt find within that Sacred Place The shining wonder of her worshipped face. All that is past is but a troubled dream; Go forward now and claim the Fact Supreme.’ Then clothed like Angels, fitting their estate, Three Souls went singing, singing through God's Gate. WHEN LOVE IS LOST When love is lost, the day sets towards the night, Albeit the morning sun may still be bright, And not one cloud-ship sails across the sky. Yet from the places where it used to lie Gone is the lustrous glory of the light. No splendour rests in any mountain height, No scene spreads fair and beauteous to the sight; All, all seems dull and dreary to the eye When love is lost. Love lends to life its grandeur and its might; Love goes, and leaves behind it gloom and blight; Like ghosts of time the pallid hours drag by, And grief's one happy thought is that we die. Ah, what can recompense us for its flight When love is lost? THE VALLEY OF FEAR In the journey of life, as we travel along To the mystical goal that is hidden from sight, You may stumble at times into Roadways of Wrong, Not seeing the sign-board that points to the right. Through caverns of sorrow your feet may be led, Where the noon of the day will like midnight appear. But no matter whither you wander or tread, Keep out of the Valley of Fear. The Roadways of Wrong will wind out into light If you sit in the silence and ask for a Guide; In the caverns of sorrow your soul gains its sight Of beautiful vistas, ascending and wide. In by-paths of worry and trouble and strife Full many a bloom grows bedewed by a tear, But wretched and arid and void of all life Is the desolate Valley of Fear. The Valley of Fear is a maddening maze Of paths that wind on without exit or end, From nowhere to nowhere lead all of its ways, And shadows with shadows in more shadows blend. Each guide-post is lettered, ‘This way to Despair,’ And the River of Death in the darkness flows near, But there is a beautiful Roadway of Prayer This side of the Valley of Fear. This beautiful Roadway is narrow and steep, And it runs up the side of the Mountain of Faith. You may not perceive it at first if you weep, But it rises high over the River of Death. Though the Roadway is narrow and dark at the base, It widens ascending, and ever grows clear, Till it shines at the top with the Light of God's face, Far, far from the Valley of Fear. When close to that Valley your footsteps shall fare, Turn, turn to the Roadway of Prayer— The beautiful Roadway of Prayer. WHAT WOULD IT BE? Now what were the words of Jesus, And what would He pause and say, If we were to meet in home or street, The Lord of the world to-day? Oh, I think He would pause and say: ‘Go on with your chosen labour; Speak only good of your neighbour; Widen your farms, and lay down your arms, Or dig up the soil with each sabre.’ Now what were the answer of Jesus If we should ask for a creed, To carry us straight to the wonderful gate When soul from body is freed? Oh, I think He would give us this creed: ‘Praise God whatever betide you; Cast joy on the lives beside you; Better the earth, by growing in worth, With love as the law to guide you.’ Now what were the answer of Jesus If we should ask Him to tell Of the last great goal of the homing soul Where each of us hopes to dwell? Oh, I think it is this He would tell: ‘The soul is the builder—then wake it; The mind is the kingdom—then take it; And thought upon thought let Eden be wrought, For heaven will be what you make it.’</field>
