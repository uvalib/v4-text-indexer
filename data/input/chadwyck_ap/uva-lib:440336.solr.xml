With War Democrats Seymour's for war; with Peace cowards for peace he'll hurrah; Let him get in the way of the mower some day, And he'll find there's no quibbling with war. [The Copperhead lotterie hath a curious policie] The Copperhead lotterie hath a curious policie; For a man of low rank can draw naught save a blank, Unless an accomplice he be.

[The traitor our Common Cents mars, And on Liberty plainly he wars] “So much dishonor my fair stars.”— King Richard III., IV. 1.
