      <field name="fulltext">WOLFE AT QUEBEC September, 1759 Cloudy that momentous morning, over sheer Canadian steeps, Broke upon the insurgent silver that St. Lawrence bends and sweeps. Bourgainville had rashly blundered; Vergor did his trust betray; Brave Mountcalm stood guard at Beauport, miles from where the danger lay. Off at Cap Rouge, cloaked by midnight, clomb the intrepid Wolfe, even then, Struggling through the tangled pines with seventeen hundred sturdy men. Up and on they pushed and clambered, briar and rock and slag their track, Up and on, with each his musket slung behind his straining back. Though achieved this arduous vantage, yet beyond still gleamed the goal; âNow for victory or for ruin!â murmured Wolfe to his own soul. Troops ere long tumultuous joined him, from the war-ships massed below, On the Plains of Abraham, with redcoats reddening its plateau. Troops ere long tumultuous faced him, whitecoats of Quebec each one, Scampering from the gate St. Louis, scurrying from the gate St. John. Languedoc's tough legion, victors in Ticonderoga's fray; Rousillon's, that made the ramparts of Fort William Henry sway; Bold BÃ©arns, that whelmed Oswego, ere its hour of ghastly sack; These, and more, that plunged through slaughter at Crown Point and Frontenac. Swift they sped, while Indian allies, wrath and scorn in every glance, Swelled with war-paint, shrieks and scalp-locks the battalions of old France. Strategist of rapier cunning, soldier of superb command, Wolfe, undaunted as a whirlwind, met and smote them with his band. Front and flank their fire beset him; knoll and thicket devilish grew, Where with ambuscaded muzzle sly sharpshooters crawled and slew. Weak of body, although in spirit staunch like his bright warrior sword, Recked he but of King and Country, heedless of renown's award. While the clansmen's Highland slogan pierced through storms of British cheers, Charged he in the teeth of peril with his Louisbourg grenadiers. Hot shot buzzed and showered about him; wounded, he would still persistâ Binding quick a random kerchief round one bullet-shattered wrist. Keen at last the death-blow came, and staggering from its hurt he fell; Hands of eager comrades caught himâcamp-fire friends that loved him well. Ere he died they bore him tidings of the enemy's routed host; Then, with passionate thanks to God, he rendered up that gallant ghost! Large from history's pale perspective doth his valorous image press, Towering o'er the dusk of discord with memorial stateliness; His indeed the loftier laurel, his indeed the patriot's palm, His the fame Time's benediction should immortally embalm. Dear to England shines his honour, yet with radiance not more mild Than to us, o'er tracts of ocean, England's transatlantic child. America, 1896. THE OLD ACTOR He plays the parts we watched him play of old With supple and vibrant voice, with healthful frame; But all his ancient skill has now grown cold And tame. The people are kind; their strenuous welcome cheers, Yet rings as if 'twere echoing, loud or low, The hardier plaudits that were given him years Ago. His art of yore, both real and regnant then, Courts now mere vacant mummery; and at whiles Mirth wages fight with melancholy ... as when He smiles. Or yet so tired he seems, by claims that task Those powers of portraiture once firm and high, Pathos but half screens humour, like a mask Worn wry. Ah, piteous trend of time, that thus may bring Genius from grand achievement to grotesqueâ Turn Falstaff tragic, and round Hamlet fling Burlesque! CONJECTURE How sad it seems that Earth should reign in space Thus lonely, and yet companioned, as we mark, By stellar myriads that so throng her dark Nightly with their pale-glittering populace! Why should her glory and grandeur miss the grace To win from heaven's creation-crowded arc At least one obvious if elusive spark Of tidings from some sister star's vague race? Nay, is it not that thousands of far spheres Yearn for communion with our own this hour, Yet find her speechless as a dead man's lip? Ah, what if Science, amid the unborn years, Might vest her with some new strange bounteous power Of interplanetary kindredship! NATURE TO ART Painter, beware lest thou too dearly prize All variant blame or cheer from clique or clan. Below the intense blue blaze of tropic skies, In valley and dell untrod by mortal man, For centuries do my giant fern-plumes tower, My bristling cacti break in glorious flower, Or yet my lissome orchids throng to raise The delicate rainbow splendours of their sprays. Sculptor, be warned ere thou too precious rate Censure or eulogy. ... Thou dost behold How carelessly in heaven I lift the great Palatial purples of my sunsetsâmould The snows of my proud mountain-summitsâcurl To airier symmetries the plastic pearl Of my pale dawnsâor hew, year after year, With silver-chiselling waves my cliffs austere. Master of music, let thine own soul make Its choicest audience. ... Do I reck who heeds Melodious and delirious winds that wake Lyres in my tree-tops, lutes among my reeds? Or if alone the meek brute grazing herds Hark to the blithe arpeggios of my birds? Or if blank sands and crags alone may hear The orchestral ocean I sublimely rear? Thee, last yet loftiest, Poet, I would remind That ever in thine own large passionate heart Thou shalt for thine own song the encomiums find Worthier as they are wiser. ... I, apart From all men, mantle my enormous nights In silence, yet their labyrinthine lights Thrill deeply with grand strains no discord mars,â The rhythm and cadence of my choric stars. PORTRAITS I THE PRIG Though genius clad you with a golden mist, For him your verses would but lamely stammer, If in their texture should by chance exist One least unholy blemish of bad grammar. Vainly, for him, the powers you would unite Of Shakespeare, Virgil, Dante, Lope de Vega, If, quoting Greek, you once presumed to write An omicron in place of an omega. II A FAILURE With all the Egyptian dynasties he copes Undaunted, and the whole long line of Popes. To nimblest English, if the mood may please, He turns the tough Greek of Thucydides. Than he no pundit wiser views may give On Sanskrit and the Ãolic optative. With ease his memory, name by name, can shoot Backward from Queen Victoria to Canute. Yet still, at fifty-seven, he sighs and frets, Pinioned by poverty and dogged by debts. III A KIND OF HYPOCRITE He grips your hand with hearty and fervid pressure; A wealth of candour beams from his full smile; And yet no Machiavelli could outmeasure The compass of his ambuscaded guile. Others by artful flatteries may caress you; Not he, thank heaven, with warm phrase blunt and terse! And yet, his most ingenuous-toned âGod bless youâ Can cloak the sleeping scorpion of a curse. Thus brazenly through life, its one most daring And dangerous masquerader, doth he go; Frank as Jack Falstaff in his outward bearing, But wily as Mephistopheles below! IV AN OLD LADY As bold October checks his gaudier tints Frosting some sheltered tree with tenderer trace, So, mild of mood, relentless age imprints With delicate blight her pink autumnal face. V A YOUNG GIRL Her mouth demure, with that shy smile it houses Below the silvery dusk of those deep eyes, Hath semblance of a curled wild-rose that drowses, Watched by mesmeric stars in summer skies. BURIALS When thou hast conquered in thine errant heart Evil desires, base passions bold or sly, Fighting them till to death at last they yield, Then bid oblivion bury them apart From all thy future, and so let them lie In their own ignominious Potter's Field! But when sweet aims and acts that now control Moods of warm human pity and helpful care, Cease from thy days, by full achievement crowned, Bid memory build for these within thy soul A mausoleum of majesty as fair As any in earthly sculpture to be found. AUX INVALIDES What dead king ever knew sepulchral gloom Lordlier than he in this last haughty home, Below the Invalides' huge golden dome, Twelve marble Victories ranging round his tomb? Here from mosaics of laurel-pictured floor We throng to mark his monolith high loom; Here sculptures laud for us his deeds and state; Here lie his brothers, kings too, since they bore His name. As though to have breathed here were to be By some reflected force of greatness great, The insensate air itself seems charged with immortality. And yet these proud memorial grandeurs, wed With reverence for the regal dust they hide, Are in their glory and pomp like petrified Tears that by widow and orphan have been shed. These porphyries and chalcedonies are cold As once was his ambition; overhead St. Louis, offering Christ the martial blade, Stares mockery; still in mockery we behold On arch or spandrel saints of earlier times; ... Till now the twelve great marble Victories fade, And in their stead tower twelve great ghosts of war's colossal crimes. Paris. LUTE AND FLUTE [I Fancy, my falcon, from this willing wrist] Fancy, my falcon, from this willing wrist Leap forth, and roam the radiant morning weather! Float high, till all its ambient amethyst Has bathed thy bold wings to their downiest feather! Here, far below thee, in the meadow's mist, I feel, dear bird, that still we bide together, Since back to earth, whene'er the mood may list, I lure thee by a touch upon thy tether! II WHITE VIOLETS While Hesper gemmed the ruby West, And lulled was all the land, You broke white violets from your breast, You laid them in my hand. âTheir poor pale ghosts,â with sighs you saidâ You said with shadowy tears, âWill haunt, long after they are dead, The unalienating years!â White violets, ah, white violets, love, Whene'er I see them now, Mysterious from their pallor steals The beauty of your white brow! I kissed the frail flowers one by one, With pangs of speechless pain; For me full many a future sun Might shine, yet shine in vain! For me, howe'er the altering scene Should shift from dark to fair, White violets must for ever mean White memories of despair! White violets, ah, white violets, love, In hope's last long eclipse The fragrance is but anguish, now, That floats from their white lips! [III I dreamed that Love came knocking] I dreamed that Love came knocking At your door one winter night, While the spectre trees were rocking In a blast of savage blight. âOh, I perish!â poor Love pleaded; âOpe the door, for Love's dear sake.â But although you heard and heeded, Still no answer would you make! Not one word of sweet replying Would your haughty lips have said, Even if Love had lain there dying, Even if Love had lain there dead! Then I dreamed that Love o'er-ruled you; For in tenderest voice he cried, âNay, dear lady, I sadly fooled you, Since I am not Love, but Pride.â And you straightway oped your portals With a merry and welcome nod, To that wiliest of immortals, To that masquerading god. Ah, you oped your portals lightly, Not for Love's but Pride's dear sake; Yet, O lady, if I dreamed rightly, Love soon taught you your mistake! IV BOUNDARY LINES Who can tell when sleep and waking meet to mingle, Meet to mingle so that sleep's deft opiate wins? Who can tell when waking pushes past the portals, Past the portals whence its potency begins? Just the moment for the breaking Of the spell between our waking And our sleep, who can tell? Just the moment for the breaking of the firm yet fragile spell, Who can tell? Who can tell when girl and woman meet to mingle, Meet to mingle so that woman wins the day? Who can tell when woman wanders past the portals, Past the portals whence outsweeps her witching sway? Just the moment for assuming That the flower at last is blooming From its bud, who can tell? Just the moment that bids girlhood from its bondage first rebel, Who can tell? Who can tell when love and languor meet to mingle, Meet to mingle so that love may win the soul? Who can tell when love goes proudly past the portals, Past the portals whence its radiant realms outroll? Just the moment of surrender To that new large life of splendour And surprise, who can tell? Just the moment that would make of earth a heaven if it were hell, Who can tell? [V From its myriads mazy] From its myriads mazy Pluck with laughter lazy This the daintiest daisy That your look descries. Tear its bloom to tatters That the south wind scatters. ... Well-and-away! what matters If it lives or dies? From this breast where dart, love, Pangs of sorrow and smart, love, Pluck the adoring heart, love, Howsoe'er it sigh! ... Heart that reverie flatters Till despair's hand shatters, Well-and-away! what matters If you live or die? [VI In her bodice there were lilies of the valley] In her bodice there were lilies of the valley, While we strolled the starlit lane between mossed bars; All the valleys of the night seemed sown with lilies, All the lilies at her bosom burned like stars. Now the valleys of the night, whene'er I search them, Bear but melancholy splendours, proudly far; And a Lily of the Valley of the Shadow Is her lost face, that was once my pilot star! VII BROWN EYES In one maid's eyes, demurely blue, Coy imps of mirth conspire; Another maid's, grey-green of hue, Are sea-mist flecked with fire; In yet another's, darkly deep, Shy flames of shadowy passion sleep. But dowered for me with dearer worth Are one more maid's rich eyes, Brown like the old brown human earth, Yet starred like midnight skiesâ As though in their warm glooms 'twere given That earth should interblend with heaven! [VIII In this green glade, at set of sun] In this green glade, at set of sun, I clasp your timorous hand; Things more divine hath nature done, In generous mood or grand; But rarely, even with spells of subtlest power, Hath she made flesh to such perfection flower. These agile fingers' willowy pearl, Each with a dimple of snow, This palm of tenderest roseleaf curl, These nails of sea-shell glow,â What choicer bevy of charms could she create? So dear a miracle how duplicate? Nay, but erroneous have I been And self-condemned I stand! For lo, the birdlike-fluttering twin Of this belovÃ¨d hand! Nature, deft counterfeiter, your device The same sweet miracle has fashioned twice! IX SYMPATHY The breeze is abroad with the daisies, Like a playmate that never tires, And they flutter in pale pulsations, They are stirred as by dim desires. Do they dream of the poor wan children In the slums of the stifling towns, Who would love so to romp through their blossoms And to wreathe them in holiday crowns? [X Girt by a meadow mirthful in flowers] Girt by a meadow mirthful in flowers, Yonder a mountain massively towers. Heaven his firm comrade through smile or frown, Moonlight his mantle, starbeams his crown, Grand gales to bear him homage unsought, Still would he languish but for the thought That far beneath him, hauntingly sweet, Daisies and buttercups break at his feet. XI FLOWER GIRLS I know a girl who's a pansy, Wistful and shy of face, Yet with her lowly and wildwood air Blending patrician grace. I know a girl who 's an orchid, Symmetry's choicest mould, Body and soul as by sculpture wrought, Both statuesquely cold. I know a girl who 's a red rose, Passionate, proud, yet sweet; I know a girl who 's a white rose, Pensive, serene, discreet. But ah, one girl, who 's a rose-in-bloom, Is dearer than all to me, While my love o'er the opening leaves of her life Hangs poised like a buoyant bee. XII INNUENDO While Paris wears her midnight calms, You lounge among your lamps and palms, Natalie; Your saint-like porcelain brows outvie The meek star of each vestal eye, Natalie! Yet when you fill with cool gold wine These flower-shaped beakers opaline, Natalie, The foamy and fragrant vintage makes A delicate hiss like some coiled snake's, Natalie! Paris. [XIII The flowers have their bold bees to woo them] The flowers have their bold bees to woo them; The brooks have their fresh rains to feed them; The nights have their stars to o'erstrew them; The dawns have their pure dews to bead them: Yet my steps go darkling, With but the dim sparkling Of memory's lamp, love, to lead them! The sea hath its waves to make sheen with; The winds have their music to sigh with; The groves have their boughs to be green with; The birds have their fleet wings to fly with: But I, in my lonely Allegiance, have only This deep-wounded heart, love, to die with! XIV EXTRAVAGANZA Were I the sun that shines for you Betwixt your arbour screens, I 'd fill with autumn wines for you The grapes that summer greens. I 'd turn your pippins gold for you Ere fierce July had fled, And bid the rose unfold for you In May its richest red. Were I the moon that beams for you, I 'd quench the unwilling stars, And flower the night with dreams for you Like silvery nenuphars. But ere my light should break from you, As heavenward larks upsoared, With silvery showers I'd make from you The DanaÃ« I adored! XV FELICIA'S FAN I Felicia's fan, that flimsy thing, A fairy calendar I call. She opes it, and you smell the spring; She furls it, and the snowflakes fall. Nay, more: Watteau-like, on one side, Felicia's fan, that flimsy thing, Is wrought with shepherdesses, tied By cherubs in a silken string. But on the other, dark elves cling To lily or fern-leaf, and burlesque Felicia's fan, that flimsy thing, With goblin antics Rembrandtesque. And so the airiest little sway Has power distractingly to bring From day to night, from night to day Felicia's fan, that flimsy thing. II Felicia's fan, that flimsy thing, Such winnowing welcomes now pervade, You dream that she hath stolen a wing From Cupid's roseate shoulder-blade. Anon, if adverse moods prevail, Felicia's fan, that flimsy thing, Is flirted like the fluttering sail Where barks are tossed and tempests ring. But when the tale of love's keen sting Your frenzied murmurs may have breathed, Felicia's fan, that flimsy thing, Shuts tightly, as though a dagger sheathed. Yet fate, however fleet or slack, Shall turn at last, when Love grows king. To mere innocuous bric-a-brac Felicia's fan, that flimsy thing! [XVI I am alone with you, Ellen Vane] I am alone with you, Ellen Vane, In the dim room where you lie; You cannot hear the wind in the pines, Nor see the red sunset die. The peace on your brow is an utter peace, Your rest an unchanging rest,â With one white rose in your hand, Ellen Vane, And one white rose on your breast. In life you loved me not, Ellen Vane. ... Do you love me now when dead? Believe me, I cast no sad reproach On your beautiful stirless head. Perhaps ... and perhaps ... and perhaps ... who knows? âBut now, good-morrow, good rest, With one white rose in your hand, Ellen Vane, And one white rose on your breast. XVII SERENADE Every flower in your garden Has a star to love it, On your lawn every grass-blade A dew-pearl above it. Every rose at your lattice Has a breeze to adore it,â Blossoming to praise it, Or dying deplore it! I that am lonely Linger and long for you,â Pale with my passion, Weave this poor song for you! White-winnowing the darkness, Dawn will behold you, With delicate splendour Inform and enfold you. From the elm at your casement The bold birds will fling you Those revelling plaudits They love so to sing you! I that am lonely Linger and sigh for you, Wearying to live for you, Willing to die for you! XVIII SANCTUARY Come, love, while the light is yet lowly and lazy O'er languors of evening's red glooms; While still the pale disc of each delicate daisy Has died not from pastures it plumes. Come, hear the large boughs of the sycamores quiver With breeze that the sunset has brought, And watch how the reeds by the rims of the river To luminous ripples are wrought. Here bide we encompassed with calms and contentments, Our souls full of exquisite rest, The haughty old world, with its hollow presentments, Remoter than yonder dim west. Its fevers and follies, its boasts and ambitions, Like vanishing vapours are past; We flouted the flaunt of their trivial traditions; We broke from their bondage at last. Great Nature has girt us with spells like the greeting Of arms that allure and enwreathe; Her brooks in their flowing, her winds in their fleeting, Have grown like the breaths that we breathe. She sighs, and we sadden; she laughs, and we brighten; Her gay moods or sombre we share; Our hope to the reach of her rainbow can heighten, Or turn, with her tears, to despair. She charms, yet she chides us, denies, yet endows us, And brews for us bitter with sweet; Yet never by tawdry pretension o'erbrows us, Nor stings us by stealthy deceit. Her gifts to no caste or preferment she panders; Divine her democracy stays; In sequences kinned with magnificent candours, We search all her deeds and her days. At last have we changed for these pageants of cloudland The pomp that from falsity flows; At last have we bartered the loud land, the proud land, For bournes of relief and repose. ... Come, love, while the light is yet lazy and lowly, Ere starshine the rich blue has cleft; Come, learn from great Nature how lofty and holy She looms o'er the life we have left. BLUEBEARD'S CHAMBER Strange old tale of crime and woe, Told heaven knows how long ago, With what shrewd insidious fret Do you haunt our memories yet! Ever as the years glide by, Fatima, with footstep sly, Lures us while her trembling tread Seeks the dim lair of the dead. Ever through long lapse of years Thrill we, as with storms of tears Fain poor Fatima would free Red stains from the ensanguined key. Round this nursery legend dwells What continuing spell of spells? Few grim husbands hide to-day Slaughtered wives in weird array, Yet how many a husband's heart Hoards in selfish pride apart, Hope, regret, ambition, aim, From the wife that wears his name! Ah, the Bluebeard's Chamber still Bides, yet bears no blood-stained sill Blest the wives that need not learn What its envious walls inurn. Blame not Fatima to-day If too venturesome she stray; Blame not Fatima if she Scours to-day the tell-tale key! MONITIONS TO A COQUETTE They laud to-night your dark eyes' diamond thrall, Your lily of hand or rose of lip. ... And yet Some trick of lamplight on the gilded wall Has made your shadow a hag's gaunt silhouette. TO A POET First from pure strong thought build your structure strong, Then deck with beauty and music its firm shape, Till rich rilievos round its portals throng And garland-wise its roofs and oriels drapeâ But ah! beware lest from your sculptured song The gargoyles of hysteria idly gape! TO A STATESMAN Never canst thou so near true grandeur's goal, Nor from penurious life wring such choice gains, As when in some dim reach of thine own soul Dungeoned Ambition clanks his hopeless chains. AN EPITAPH Imperial was the palace of his life; With memory you may roam its chambers yet. Here was the throne-room of his intellect, Sumptuous for purple tapestries; and here The aerial domed hall of his eloquence; And here the innumerous-alcoved library Of his vast erudition; and here drowsed The rosy and many-mirrored lair of all His fine poetic visions; and here gleamed The sanctum of his heartiest friendships, fair With clustering lights, heaped fruit, and ruddy wine; And here, august and sculptural, abode The shrine of his white honour. Oh, in truth, Imperial was the palace of his life! Yet memory, if you will, may lead you past The cobwebbed gloom of yonder bolted door, And show you there the assassinated shape Of Charity. Long since he smote her dead, And hid her thus, to moulder through the years In that dark haunt, once beautiful, but now Dolorous with mildewed garnitureâsole blot On this the imperial palace of his life. ASSOCIATION I know a maid who says me nay, But whose warm wizardries of lure, Whate'er the distance I shall stray, With dear companionships endure. For when the lily of dawn breaks pure, Its peace and sanctity impart In chaste auroral portraiture The semblance of her virgin heart. Or yet, while pulses glow and start, Her voice my answering spirit thrills, When deep through lyres of leafage dart The zephyr's long euphonious trills. Or in some damask rose that spills Rare balms and dews her lips I trace; Her laugh the allegros of the rills Repeat; the willow applauds her grace. And when the darkening doors of space Benignant night's bold hand unbars, The silvery symbols of her face Throng earthward from a thousand stars. THE AÃRONAUT An aÃ«ronaut, who dwelt upon the moon Of a huge planet which at night's full noon From shadow and mystery anon and oft Would loom in gold enormity aloft, After long labours wrought a wondrous car, Wherewith to journey toward that statelier star. Alone he ventured, in audacious flight, From world to world,âa task of peerless might! But when he had reached the star, at bland mid-day, One of its giant habitants, who lay Dreamily dozing near a summer sea, With vast prone breast and mountainous crooked knee, Deemed him some insect, troublous although small, And brushed him to oblivion, car and all! THE OLD NOVELIST'S MONOLOGUE So you've written a novel, you clever boy, and ask me to read it through? A serious task, at my time of life, when I'm turning seventy-two. But it 's complimentary, nevertheless, for a grandson twenty-four To vote his grandfather's views and creeds are a boon instead of a bore. I 've written famous novels, you say? Dear Guy, it was long ago! I must read myself up. I 've forgotten the names of at least a dozen or so. Do the people take to them kindly still? I recallâthe publishers do ... That 's a bit of a pose, I'm afraid you'll think, for a fellow of seventy-two. But I never posed, and I told my tales no less with head than with heart, And I trusted art for the sake of truth, not art for the sake of art. Let me give you a bit of warning, boy; it 's a path full of snares and slips Before, like Roland, you reach the tower and set the slug to your lips. Hell 's paved, they say, with intentions good; you may take it ill or well, But you'll find before you are forty, Guy, that literature is hell! God help the best of 'em when they seek, howsoever brave their laugh, To make it (as old Sir Walter said) a crutch instead of a staff! But thanks to your dear dead father's thrift, you can twirl the cane to your tasteâ You never need drown in the newspaper sea; there 's a belt of cork round your waist. I 've seen so many who went like thatâpoor, dauntless, with troops of friends; They burned their candle to quite a blaze, for they burned it at both its ends. And soon they had left but the smoking wicks in lieu of the bridling flame, And even the smoke long ago has gone, though the world once called it fame. But you, dear boy, have the chance and choice; you 've the honey without the gall; Euterpe may wait in your anteroom and Pegasus fume in your stall. You can spend a week on the turn of a phrase till its tinkle is deftly placed; You haven't that hair at the nib of your pen, with its harsh little name of haste. You can stare in Minerva's grey-green eyes, and vow, by their dreams beguiled, That you'll ache with a discontent divine till her sculptured lips have smiled. But ah, be cautious, my gifted Guy; there are waves that lurk to whelm Even hardier-builded boats than yours, when leisure is at the helm. Excalibur meant mere clumsy steel till Pendragon its hilt had reared, And Aladdin, you know, had to rub his lamp before the genie appeared. You ask me for counsel? Gird your loins; disheartenment laugh to scorn; With a sturdy alpenstock clamber up where the mountains meet the morn. Don't aspire to scale the loftiest peak; Shakespearian lungs are rare. ... Still, climb as long as your own can breathe the attenuated air. Of its tonic opal quaff great gulps ere you look on the lands below; For the lands will be Life; you must watch them well, with their wonderful overflow. Then choose what you cannot will but choose in their bounty of shades and shines, From the glimpses of brooks' far silver threads to the glooms of austere pines; From the heavenward hope of a neighbour hill to the storm-cloud's black despair; From arrogances of the splintry crags to the meek sweet moss they wear; From the sleepy calms (with their browsing goats) of the emerald vales and glades To those pale perpetual suicides of the precipiced cascades. You will find them all, for they all are merged, with their moods of peace or strife, In the deeps and heights, in the lengths and breadths, of that Switzerland called Life. ... Out of Life take phases you love the bestâonly these, if you are wise; Through Inferno Dante walked like a god, but he stumbled in Paradise. Yet be most of all your authentic self. Seek truth and beauty and power By a straight road, not by sinuous ones. Disdain the ephemeral hour. From the cavern of memory brush with zeal all the echoes that bat-like cling Till the only echoes its walls throw back from your own voice rise and ring. Academic? Gothic? Who cares which, so long as you shun mere sham? If you long for a Parthenon, try it, lad. If you don't, try a Notre Dame. But whatever conception you may plan, make sure it is crystal-clear. Half a thought, half a brain. Besides, the obscure is mostly the insincere. ... So, I'll read your novel. My eyes are poor, but I'll read it faithfully throughâ A serious task, at my time of life, when I'm turning seventy-two. DEI GRATIÃ The height of his dead father's throne he gained, With supple courtiers cringing at his nod. A shallow and beardless boy, thenceforth he reigned By the grace of God. Impervious to the people's blame or praise, Through codes of civic needs he scorned to plod; With harlots, dice and wine he passed his daysâ By the grace of God. But oft, when spurned by some rash whim of rule, O'er laws and liberties he rode rough-shod, And lived as reprobate no less than fool, By the grace of God. For years the crown did he thus coarsely keep, Wearing its grandeur like a dolt and clod, Then died one evening in a drunken sleepâ By the grace of God. BASILICA SAN PIETRO I Here in firm armistice do I behold Antagonisms commingled with strange easeâ Humility and grandeur blent in one, And meekness with humility allied. How sovereign these vast ceilings, groined with gold! This bounty of paintings, frescoes, pillars; these Rich mausoleums of martyr, pope, saint, nun; This baldachino, towering in bronze pride! II And yet the Christ, for whose apostle's fame Such flare and riot of luxury were wrought, Went barefoot over Galilean sand, Among the obscure and outcast lowliest He! Nay, of the suppliant votaries that came Seeking His benediction, He besought Renouncement of their moneys, flocks, and land, Saying to them, âLeave all and follow Me.â Rome. THE TWILIGHT OF POETRY I moved at midnight through veils of vapour that interblended or backward blew, Until the folds of their drowsy volumes at last had faded like morning dew. And then before me a land was visioned, a land of dimness and calm intense, By dawn or sunset alike discarded, illumined vaguely, I knew not whence. Through laurelled verges a stream went slipping where towered a temple in marble peace, A pillared fabric that wore like fragrance the skill, the grandeur, the grace of Greece. Beneath it wandered a stately wardress, whose brows were god-like, who roamed and sang Melodious tumults of lamentation, where lyric anguish divinely rang. âThough vestured once with its vaunted homage, I droop to-day with the world's disdain; Lo, these my fountains and courts forsaken; lo, this my temple, deserted fane! âAbove me arches no more the azure that warmed and welcomed my birds and blooms; I dwell diskingdomed in desolation; I grope and falter through taunting glooms. âWhite-bearded Homer once blindly sought me; from foot-worn sandals I loosed their thongs, And bade him smite me his harp of thunder, and bade him sing me his mighty songs. âClear on through ages, like pious pilgrims, all proudest minstrels, with humbled air, Have crossed my thresholds and craved my counsels, have paced my gardens and found them fair. âIn lofty converse my lips have taught them the creeds of beauty and all its claims; For beauty and poesy intertangle, and flash from contact ambrosial flames. âI told of languors on lakes that slumber where dense woods clasp them and boughs hang low; Of mountains plunging and tumbling skyward to fling at failure clenched hands of snow. âI spake of nights, how they know as mortals long lonesome vigils, like prayer and pain, With stars like hopes and with moons like passions, that wax for ever, for ever wane. âI spake of days, how they die as men do, their listless lilacs, their silvers cold, Their pearly rose-tints like resignation, delirious crimsons, rebellious gold. âOf that huge portrait, the sea, where mingle such myriad emblems of human fatesâ Its wrath like man's and its lulls repentant, its deeps unsounded, its loves, its hates. âFor man to nature by bonds of beauty is bound in spirit, and ever shares The march and meaning of her mutations, her calms or frenzies, her joys, despairs. âWhat power like mine may reveal or picture these forms and phases, twofold yet one? What power like Poesy, me, arch artist, whom throngs that worshipped now spurn and shun! âO sister Music, full well thou knowest, howe'er thine altars be crowned and kissed, That I transcend thee and tower above thee, as heaven o'ermantles its moods of mist. âO sister Painting, for all thy potence, for all thy wonder of hue and line, I am to thee as an oak to its ivy, and thou to me art as palm to pine. âO sister Sculpture, whose charms I cherish, whose pale dominions my heart adores, Thy genius breaks on my grander genius like shining surges on beetling shores. âYe are three sweet strings, O my three sweet sisters, of that great lute which my arms can shrine; There are many strings besides these ye symbol, but these and the lute itself are mine! âFor I am intellect, love, emotion; my realm is vast as the human soul; I oversoar ye and undersweep ye; I comprehend ye and I control. âMen flout me and fleer me in this base epoch, degrade my godship, despise my tears, While racked with odium of such gross usage, I bide immortal, for all their jeers!â So Poesy in my vision lifted her voice of protest, of woe and pride; And yet through all the ungrateful twilight not even one pitying echo sighed. AN IDYL OF THE SLUMS Daughter. How the stench reeks from that piled garbage there, Out in the courtyard at the alley's end! I can't sleepâMother, are you still dead-drunk? Mother. No. What 's o'clock, Jess? Daughter. Clock? We 've got no clock. You pawned it yesterday to buy more drink. Mother. Yes, I remember. Daughter. Mother, you believe There 's a God somewhere, don't you? Mother. Go to sleep. Daughter. I can't. I keep so wishing I was well, Not stung with this dry cough that splits my throat, Not lame of an ankle, not so cursed with scabs On hips, breasts, eyelids. I'm half blind, sometimes, The rank sores weigh and drag so. Mother, hark: Is there a God? A God that cares, I mean. Mother. Go to sleep. Daughter. Now, if I was like Nell Page! She 's got a clean pink skin and big blue eyes. Last night a sailor stopped her in the street And took her to a place where they had beer, Cheese, meatâyou know the rest. But when we met, Why, Nell was merry as a canary-bird While its cage brims with sun. I 'd get a meal, A ribbon, and things to light up life a bit, If I 'd Nell's eyes and skin. The meanest man Won't give me one kind look. Say, mother, sayâ Is there a God? Mother. Go to sleep, rattle-tongue! Curse ye, to keep me awake! Daughter. Oh, I was cursed Before you 'd brought me forth. Folks tell me blunt That this weak sick maimed body o' mine was made All by my father. Yes, folks tell me blunt He 'd put some filthy poison in his blood. Where is my father? Do you know for sure? Mother. Go to sleep, brat, or else I'll crack your skull With the old rusted axeâI swear I will! Daughter. How the lice pester! Oh, I'll soon sleep sound! Yet, ah, before then I 'd so like to face That father o' mine and shame him if I could, With this poor twisted piteous little shape, With these red sores that itch and burn me so. I'm sure, though he were scarlet from raw drink As you are now, I 'd bring a kind o' a new Flush to his bloated cheeks, once harrying him With the hurt thing he 's made me. Come, now; say Who is my father? Tell me; you must know. Mother (drowsily). Goâtoâsleep. âWho 'sâyourâfather?â Iâforget. CONTEMPLATIONS I ONE TOUCH OF NATURE I believed thee, friend, with unflinching faith, I revered and loved thee well, Till the foe drew near whom I need not name, with his hints like sparks from hell. He showed me a blot that I dared not doubt on thy large unsullied soul; He tore from the sacred head of my saint its illumining aureole. Oh, strange by the shattered statue's form to watch where its fragments lie! From the lute's half-ruptured strings, oh, strange to hear the old music sigh! Oh, strange where the bounteous lamp once beamed, its enfeebled flame to scan! In place of the white-browed god, oh, strange to behold but the earthly man! And yet is perfection always rich in the rarer, the subtler charms? Would the Venus of Melos lure the same were she reendowed with arms? Has the speckless pearl a delight to match the pearl that must always bear Its pathos of one little birth-mark flaw to remind us it still is fair? So now, while I feel thee fallible thus, I find (as 'twere fate's choice boon!) That reverence had keyed my love too high, and that sympathy sets it in tune. Nay, the fault I have loathed for the stain it stamps on a purity such as thine, Makes thee dearer still to my human heart, since it leaves thee less divine. [II A thousand years ago] A thousand years ago Two lovers, fond as we, Saw the rich moondawn glow On glooms of breezy sea. The same titanic moon, the same swart waves! Where are those lovers? Who may break the oblivion of their graves? A thousand years from now Two lovers will behold A moondawn wake and plough These tides to airy gold. The same grand moon, the same lulled sea's caress! Where are those unborn lovers? Who shall dare even dream or guess? A thousand years ago? A thousand years from now? ... Let us not care to know If ardour of kiss or vow To slumberous past or mystic future be Either, for time's unswerving sweep, memory or prophecy! Let us this one supreme Night so augustly dower With passion that 'twill seem A dark yet gorgeous flower, Blossoming for love to pluck, for love to bruise, For love with holy and fiery tears to dim its heavenly hues! III HOME-COMING Back after journeying leagues of guileful sea, Back from long tarriance among climes remote. I did not guess what heats of amity Lay hidden among the hearts of these my friends. Absence has clothed me with a purple state, Crowned me and sceptred me a transient king With those I love and those I had dreamed till now Not half so rich in love's warm loyalties; While clear through every greeting, equable As breezes through a grove of sister trees, One bland familiar human impulse floats! Different indeed the welcome, had I fared Back from that vaporous voyage we all must make Sooner or later to the Unknowable! How then the faces leaned toward mine would flash With query, amazement, awe! How Faith would clutch My hand victoriously! How Science, then, Eager for larger lore, would clasp my knees! And ah, how chill Negation's eyes of ice Would blaze upon me their supreme surprise! IV ENCOURAGEMENT Pause if the adverse phrase Too careless from your lips Unpitying slips, Whene'er you are prompted to dispraise Man's dreams in poem or painting wrought, Music or marble. Ask your thought If power and purpose may not here Inseparably bide, Yet to your cursory heed appear Valueless because dim-descried. From charms of sky, field, brook, Coldly one oft will turn, While some more fortunate look, Gifted with keener pupil, suppler lid, Magic may there discern And treasure. To the Egyptian, drowsy-eyed, Half its grey grandeur may perforce be hid, Even as the pages of an unread book, By his familiar yet proud pyramid. Ye that, being human, therefore should be kind, Bear well in mind That he who strives to trim art's holy flame, Finds in the applausive glance Given him sincerely, zest for larger aimâ For loftier effort finds rare sustenance. Spleen on conspicuous faults forbear to wreak, Nor merely carp and cavil at what is weak In his creation. Better gaze askance At flaws, remembering how rich help is lent By even a whispered word Heard faintly, and yet when heard Dear as choice balms to limbs fatigue hath spent, A boon and benediction sweetly blent, Live with the elixir of encouragement. V HOLLYHOCKS Your long stalks bend not, though some drowsy breeze Comes flying to their gay blooms with warm caress; And yet you allure and cheer us, none the less, By sturdy beauty and honest homespun ease. Like some sweet housewife whose plain graces please, Dear charms of domesticity you possess, In simple uncoquettish motherliness Taking the homage of allegiant bees. Around you countless happy memories thrive: We hear the cluck of chickens or low of kine; We see the old dog, the willow gnarled and great, The meek grey horse that rosy children drive, The mossy well with lattice-tangled vine, The lovers loitering by the moonlit gate. [VI O Prejudice, thou spider shrewd] O Prejudice, thou spider shrewd, For ever weaving on, in wicked mood, From threads of slander, threads of shame, Thy cobwebs through the halls of fame, Till Death, with besom bluff and strong, From groins and rafters where they throng, Sweeps clear away The unclean array! [VII There are three ways God might reveal Himself] There are three ways God might reveal Himself To one that sought His deity full declared. The first, through Natureâmountain, valley or sea, From heaven's height to cave's deep; from clod to star. The second, still through Nature, and that man'sâ His loftier doings, his diviner aims. The third, through ScripturesâBible or Koran, Or Zendavestaâwords that seem God's own. Of these three ways, tired mortal, which thy choice? Either, or none? If none, doubt bravely on. [VIII If, after many a year of cold eclipse] If, after many a year of cold eclipse, I broke death's bonds and breathed once more on earth, What question, then, from these long-exiled lips, Would leap to instant and impetuous birth? How sweet of Science, and its new stronger sway, To ask! Yet all such query, I do avow, Would be postponed that I might merely say: âTell me what new grand poet have ye now?â [IX Imperious to the dying rose rang forth] Imperious to the dying rose rang forth A blare of autumn, like a blast of fate: âThe South was once your lover; now the North Shall whelm you with a wave of equal hate. Quick from your lissome leaves the glad red goesâ Quick from their deep heart floats the fragrant breath! Of all your beauty and grace, O boastful rose, I am the desolation and the death!â Mysterious where a withered rose-tree grew, Murmured Spring's voice, half cadence, half caress: âWake, flower, below bland calms of summer blue, With lures of reincarnate loveliness! Back to your phantom leaves the sly red flowsâ Full soon with heavenly balm shall they be rife! Of all your beauty and grace, O trustful rose, I am the resurrection and the life!â X A VISION OF PROGRESS I dreamed that on some planet like our own Man had for certainty at last found out There was no God. All possibility Of faith had shrivelled into nothingness. The secret of the Sphinx at last was told; The universe had no more mystery Wherewith to enmantle its magnificence. Knowledge reigned victor; from minutest life To lordliest she had solved the Why and Whence. Then thousands, crying in horror and dismay âThere is no God!â slew misery and despair By the same stab, leap, bane that slew themselves, Till all the lands reeked red with suicide. But myriads more (so marked I in my dream) Dared to live on, desired it, and communed Thus with their own souls: âDie, if so ye must; Humanity is with immortality Still wedded; right and justice, truth and love Shall be our deity. Tear our churches down; Too long their spires have pointed to a lie. Far holier temples than their holiness Are built invisibly yet palpably By mutual pity, fellowship, and help.â Years passed like minutes in my dream. I saw Life grown a sanctitude of high resolve, Centred in one divine democracy, With Now and Here its region of reward, Not fabulous Hereafter. And I saw Death utterly dispeopled of its dreads, Ghosts, legends, fantasies and menaces. Then, in my dream, I said to my glad heart, âKnowledge hath told this world there is no God, Yet left it love and cast out fear of death. Surely such boon of unexampled peace Were worth a million vacuous creeds and prayers!â [XI To the ivy said the oak] To the ivy said the oak: âHalf my majesty you cloak, Half my power and pride efface! You are beauteous, yet I vow That I tire, through bole and bough, Of your burdening embrace.â From the heavens a wild storm broke, Gashed with lightning the grand oak, Then in roars of wrath withdrew. But the pitying ivy twined Round the great tree's ruined rind, And so veiled its blight from view. [XII We greet with quickening pulse the story] We greet with quickening pulse the story That shrouds a warrior's name in glory. Yet loftier courage means the giving Far less to dying than to living. It means with grip no stress can sever To clutch the sword of high endeavour, And wage, in patience and persistence, This bloodless battle called existence. XIII THE OUTLOOK We prate of progress with so sure A trust in its firm onward sweep, As though mankind from sluggard sleep Had risen, and sturdier and more pure, Since warmed by his awakening hour, Bloomed unmolested into statelier power. Nay, Evolution, in thy name Bewildering errors have been wrought. Thou deadenest retrospective thought Until its reach and scope are lame, Until even fancy's backward bound Thrills, pauses, at thine origins profound. Centuries are thy mere minutes; all Of seeming betterment we trace In any or every earthly race To-morrow extinction with her pall May shroud; and where vast sea now sighs, Old submerged continents may re-arise! Once more from protoplasm's dull mire May man crawl slothful, and once more May nature thrust him, as of yore, Through ape and cannibal to higher, Till superstition's loom re-weaves New mythic Edens, with new Adams, Eves. Once more the old train of tragic things May find our history so rehearsed That poor mortality will be cursed By new popes, priests, fanatics, kings, New Neros, Torquemadas, new Odiums of sect, with all dire deeds they do. Again, for ages dim as dream, The annihilation may precede The recommencement. Love, hate, greed, Humanity, envy, ruth, may seem To threads of that famed broidery kin Which the Greek Queen, unravelling, would re-spin. But always through each phase of change Loitering, will flow henceforth as flows To-day, one strenuous force (who knows?) Toward riper growth and richer range. ... It cost a million million years To shape your eye that sees, mine ear that hears. The individual perishes; man thrives, Though Ã¦ons of stern failure balk With ruining hindrance. We may talk Whole heavens of hope about our lives Hereafter, while our spendthrift days Glare at us here with sarcasm in their gaze. Live for the actual balm or sting Of joys and sufferings that concern The intense keen present. Nay, nor turn Mystery's mute acolyte, and swing Blind faith's theatric censer, fraught With suave insidious fumes that strangle thought! [XIV So many of us are dead before we die] So many of us are dead before we die! The rhythm of life has lost for us all tune; Our dial of sunshine hath forgot its noon; We think in autumns, while the ungrudging sky Still bends to us the effulgence of its June, And every flower amid our garden's maze, With each bluff zigzag bee that thither strays, Plots blithe rebellion against winter's blast. Thus we turn callous to the live day's deeds, Deafening our ears howe'er the present pleads, Crowning with memory's myrtles our pale past, A thankless ghost that neither hears nor heeds. SLEEP AND DEATH In ancient years, where yew and cypress made Long avenues of labyrinthine shade, Death, while he sauntered through their cryptic deep, Came sudden upon the spectral shade of Sleep. âHow like, though differing,â mused he, âis our lot! Thou art my sister, yet I know thee not; Thou hast thy sorceries, even as I have mineâ Tell me, sweet ghost, what spells do they enshrine?â Then Sleep, with sorrowing voice: âMy reign would be All bounty of sacred blessing, save for thee! To-day earth's millions cower thy servile slaves, Wide-wandering one, whose footsteps are men's graves! âThy boon, I grant, is infinite release; But ah, how oft, before its final peace, The appointed paths thy vassalages tread, Archways of lingering anguish overspread! âGhastly thy cold halls of oblivion gleam; Ethereal float through mine fair forms of dream. How ruthless frown thy ministries! In mine Are opiates and mandragoras divine!â Then Death: âWith nightmares, too, thy realm is rife;â Signs of our kinship, these, being death-in-life! Thus merge our mysteries, even as sea with sky; Sovereigns alike we reign, yet know not why. âStill, with strange whispers, full of charm and cheer, The spirit whose name is Hope hath sought mine ear. Boast not that thou alone from realms of rest Benignantly thy votaries wakenest. âPerchance for my nepenthes fate may bring Some antidote's revitalising sting. Perchance the drafts lethean that I distil May kill far kindlier than they seem to kill. âPerchance when all, sweet sister, hath been said, I am clad far more with mercy than with dread. Ah! wait with me, through all time's vague advance, The authentication of that bright Perchance.â HYDE PARK ON SUNDAY In weather matchless for a London March, I rambled slowly past the Marble Arch. The Common, broad below a silver sun, Swept its green turf toward misty Kensington. But nearer still, huge pearls of transient clouds Flung sprays of rainfall on the unheeding crowds. Engirt by one, a lean and flame-eyed man Thundered his theories red-republican. In one a scoffer glowered o'er huddled heads, And tore with sneers the Bible into shreds. Keen through a third some woman's dismal yell Pictured in vocal daubs a chronic Hell. I sauntered onward. ... âVulgarisms of rant, Half pompous brawl,â I mused, âhalf piteous cant! âFor gyves disrupt, for tyrannies defied, Too many an English life has bled and died âThat liberty from its ideal should stray In this licentious and fantastic way!â Yet soon like bell-peals that new measures clang, My altering mood with self-reproaches rang. âCarper,â I said, âin penitence confess The folly of your own fastidiousness! âThis freedom you deplore with dainty hate Old England laboured centuries to create. âLet them shout on, in sunshine, rain, or mist, Fanatic, bigot and sensationalist, âWhile clear through all the clamorous webs they weave Wisdom's authentic voice will sometimes cleave. âBetter their coarsest babblings than the banes Of choked opinion, argument in chains; âBetter their worst of spleens unthralled should fume Than rankle and fester in a dungeon's gloom. âBetter this wordy warfare, loth to cease, Than pests of parliamentary police. âBetter these lingual wranglings, first and last, Than chill star-chambers of the purblind past. âBetter Hyde Park on Sunday, though it shock Taste and decorum, than the Tower and Block. âBetter loud rights of speech, whate'er the creeds, Than those vile silences the despot breeds!â LOVE AT SCHOOL Fatigued by tricks whose guile and glee Would man or maid for ever fool, At last Love told himself that he Would mend his ways and go to school. His purple-shimmering wings he slipped Inside a jerkin plain and spare; With dews that strange dark night-flowers dripped He stained his glorious golden hair. Then, carrying neither dart nor bow, Meek-browed beneath his raven curls, To school he fared, with eyelids low, And joined the little boys and girls. In goggles green a grisly shrew Flung forth her questions, harsh and quick; She made her pupils bound Peru; She racked them with arithmetic. She shook her birch, while pale and dumb They balked at grammar, piteous throng! ... She bade them spell âchrysanthemum,â And snorted when they spelt it wrong. With gaze demure and mien sedate Through all the bluster she revealed, Now mirthful, now compassionate, His mighty wisdom Love concealed. Exempt from tasks, a scholar new, He slyly marked his mates forlorn, And while he watched them yearnings grew To quell their tyrant's wrath and scorn. âQuit books,â he cried, in merriest voice, And pranced impetuous from his chair; âThe heavens with holiday rejoice, And buds are bursting everywhere!â He lightly doffed his dull disguise And lightly dashed, in gladsome haste, To seize, despite her wild surprise, The beldame by her bony waist. âCome, dance!â he hailed, and woke the wiles Whose power no vantage may avert. ... Her doleful wrinkles died in smiles; With nimble wrist she twirled her skirt. Then straight the stiff room's ugly square Was filled with torches' fairy jets, And all the new irradiate air Was loud with lutes and clarionets. Love laughed as though gone wild for joy, Pirouetting on his bloomy toes, And every little girl and boy Tumultuous from their seats arose. Unchecked, unchid, they romped and raced, By spells of mystic zeal possessed, And every little boy embraced The little girl he liked the best. âA reel!â they heard their master shout, And swept to shape the double row, With round-about and in-and-out, With down-in-the-middle and dos-Ã -dos. They danced like mad, but madder yet The gaunt old teacher's form would whirl. She kissed each little boy she met, But did not kissâeach little girl. So all his caprioles, curves and springs Love made their scampering steps obey,â Till tired he oped his orient wings And impudently flew away. And then, while fleeting fast and free, With diamond eyes and dimpled cheeks, He cried: âWhat fools these mortals be! I have not found such fun for weeks!â ANTITHESES Ethel's eyes are evening, In their vaporous blue; Mabel's eyes are morning, Diamonded with dew. Ethel's hair hath lustres Like a midnight sea's; Mabel's daffodil tresses Might delude the bees. Ethel's voice flows golden, Like her calm wise words; Mabel's treble of laughter Stills the envious birds. Ethel's brows are sculpture, And a lily her lips; Mabel's mouth is rosier Than dawn's finger-tips. Ethel's air shines candour Unto all she meets; Mabel's varying dimples Are divine deceits. Ethel has one sweetheart, Held in holiest thrall; Mabel at least has twenty, And she mocks them all. ACTÃON Long had I known that steep wood you may enter Best where the labyrinthine laurels clusterâ Long heard that in its breezy and pool-pearled centre, With gold hair showering o'er her snow-chaste lustre, The goddess bathed, of rough intrusion fearless, Ringed by her maids, herself a maid of mien sublime and peerless. What dolt in all BÅotia knew not surely The sheer-perched grove no mortal had invaded, Where every flickering leaf shone out more purely Because of the immaculate Shape it shaded? How oft in woodside strolls, when but a stripling, Heard I from this fair mountain-slope Ã¦olian laughters rippling! âThither forbear with impious feet to venture,â My kindred warned, in eager tones yet tender; âHot on his head shall fall the fury and censure Who scans but one brief instant her white splendour. Better the boar's rude tusk to fleet death called him Than that those luminous limbs of hers and sea-green eyes appalled him.â And yet, that noon, while my tired dogs were lolling, Loose-tongued from chase, on turfy emerald reaches, With folly I spurned the wiser will controlling All that is best in man. ... Great murmurous beeches And shadowy firs before my stretched hands yielded; I glided slowly alongâthen, shuddering, my rash gaze I shielded. Nude, lovely, and terrible, I saw her clearly ... Yet from that hour the sun in heaven turned sickly; The violet valley-mist grew vapour merely; Tame the pale cataract from the crag shot quickly: For so the immortal in her might had chidden This insolence of mine entrance past the bounds of the forbidden. And thus, being shorn of every earthly gladness, I drag my days out. ... Silly and false the story That these my faithful dogs were fired by madness, Fought for my body and ate its fragments gory. A deadlier vengeance yet from life hath reft me: I have drained all joy at one wild draughtâthe lees alone are left me! TO DANTE O Dante, if you had lived in later years, I think the regal radiance of your brain Would not have spent itself on all those vain Sarcasms and ironies, where vengeance rears A crest so viperous! Not the groans and tears Wrung from your foes in their eternal pain Would best have pleased you, but that loftier gain Of pity and pardon for the world's worst jeers. This house of hate you have builded, wrought so dread With gargoyles that leer scorn below, above; With huge dark spires; with noisome crypt and den;â Ah, Dante, if you had fashioned it, instead, From the pure marble of mercy and of love, How mightier and more beauteous were it then! SLANDER From random converse, grave or gay, A poisonous little lie was born. Like many a lie that looks on day, It failed to hold itself in scorn. It preened each tiny and bat-black wing, And felt for its nice poignant sting, And said, with secret gladness, âI Am a full-fledged symmetric lie.â Mounting in air, it paused a while, Then lighted on a gossip's lip; The gossip, with indifferent smile, Brushed it aside, yet bade it slip Into an old beau's prattling mouth, Whence wandering north, east, west and south, It buzzed beside the ear, at last, Of one who gazed on it aghast. Slyly it buzzed a tale of taint That smirched with blame the treasured life Of one whose duteous deeds made saint The unworded synonym for wife. He caught the weak slim wasp-like lie, Crushed it in both hands, watched it die. .. But dying it dared this taunt to fling: âMy ghost lives on; my ghost can sting!â ALLEGORY One day sweet Poesy, with her cheeks aflame, To the large land of Science angered came. She had borne till now from her new neighbour foe A thousand odious wrongsâor fancied so. But he, indifferent to her love or hate, Had smiled contemptuous at her vaunted state. Yet both, being met, were pierced with sharp surprise At deeps divine in one another's eyes. âI deemed,â said Poesy, âthou couldst never wear So much of human in thine austere air!â âAnd I,â said Science, âdreamed not thou couldst be So simple and yet so clad with sovereignty!â Hence 'tis now rumoured that erelong these twain Shall merge in marriage their divided reign, And that grim Reason, when the knot is tied (Science commanding), shall as priest preside, While Poesy issues an august decree: All the Nine Muses must her bridesmaids be. TRIUMPH He sat alone, with brooding glance; He gnawed his lips, with angered frown; He thought of how austere mischance Had crushed him tyrannously down. Faint footfalls echoed at his side: He turned; a shadowy shape was near; He scanned it with rebellious pride: âDark form,â he breathed, âwhat dost thou here?â The strange guest laughed in harsh disdain: âForbear,â she scoffed, âfrom tame deceit. Behold, I am the incarnate pain Long dealt thee by thine own defeat!â He rose and faced her, stern of brow. ... âI know thee, Failure, fierce and brave! So be it; thou shalt not quit me now, But bide my prisoner and my slave!â His rough hands caught her as to kill; With scorn he marked her moan and plead; He bowed her to his dauntless will; He bent her like a wind-bent reed. For days his mastery taxed her sore; No menial task she dared refuse; She cooked his meat; she swept his floor; She trimmed his lamp; she latched his shoes. Yet always, while she served him so, Her mien of gloom with gradual stir Kept altering, till at last the glow Of glorious change invested her. Then low, in tenderer mood, said he, With softening gaze, with fond caress: âCome, reign my wedded wife, and be Henceforth not Failure, but Success!â THE DAWN OF ETHICS (The heart of a tree. A man-ape, a woman-ape. It is early twilight, thousands of years ago.) Man-ape. You know that huge tree by the small stream's edge, Where dwells, with two weak babes, the pair we hate? Woman-ape. I know. Man-ape. To-night both sire and dam will join The great dance in the valley at moonrise. I Shall mix not with them, this once, nor do thou. Woman-ape. Why thus resolve? The Moon-God may be wroth If we shriek not his praise and gash ourselves On this the sacred night when he beams full. Man-ape. 'Tis a mild god. His wrath we need not fear. He is not like the Sun-God, who darts death, Nor like the erratic lightning, nor its mate, The august thunderânay, nor like those gods Of snow, flood, pest, grim powers we dare not slight. Stay thou, as I have bid thee. When those babes, Left all alone, are slumbering, seek their sides, Leap at their throats and choke them. Afterward Bring me their corpses to that cave whose mouth Is bearded thick with vinesâyou know the spot. There shall I feast that have not sucked man's blood For days, but starve lean-lipped on herb and root. Woman-ape. I will obey thee. Man-ape. Else, I'll beat thee so That thou shalt writhe and rave beneath my strokes! (He goes away, and the woman-ape muses.) Woman-ape. There, in a covert of cool leaves, with limbs Laid languid on the bough's clean brawn of bark, Slumbers my babe. If I indeed should slip At moonrise to that big stream-bowering tree, Clutch those two babes and choke them ere they waked, Hurrying their dead forms to the cave where crouched My mate, with hunger's glare in his fierce eyes Between dark fells of hair on brows and cheeks,â If so I obeyed this murderous hest of his, What chance for my poor babe, some future eve, When parents of those twain I late had killed Should scent my guilt and lust for vengeance dread? ... Nay, I'll not do this work he bade me do,â Not though he beat me till my yells rang out Keener than those wild voices that erelong Shall fill the valley at moonrise, when mad throngs Tear limb-from-limb our heaven-doomed captives' frames And toss their bleeding fragments to the stars. WHOM THE GODS LOVE You say that being so old 'Twas time for him to die? Rings not your comment cold And even inhuman? Why Should tenderer tears be shed When death lays young lives low, Spared years of sorrow and fret, Spared age's overthrow? When young we are called away, We shirk untold regret; For austere time will slay Not merely ourselves, but yet Brand with authentic sign His despotisms elsewhereâ Drape wisps of silvering hair O'er eyes belovedâplough line And furrow on treasured cheeks. âWhom the gods love die young.â .. Ah me! there wisdom's tongue With sovereign accent speaks! Pity the old who die; The young behind them leave Such bounteous grief whereby Fate bids they shall not grieve! Heart-racked with many a sigh, Wounded with many a scar, Pity the old who die; The young are happier far! POMPEII One bland morn, while I stood near that famed bay Which fronts the world's most tragic ruin of all, And while, in violet vapour's dimming thrall, Castellammare and Sorrento lay Southward beyond the luminous cove, some sway Of trance, or witchery still more magical, Seized me and bade, with swiftness to appal, The live luxurious past my soul dismay. From many a villa's bright floor, flower-bestrewed, Fountains leaped glittering; temple and street and square Swarmed with gay Greeks; rich chariots rumbled by; And in one sweet miraculous glimpse I viewed, Rebuilt, repeopled, reincarnate there, The revel of radiance that was Pompeii! Naples. HER STATUE A sculptor who adored his fair young wife, Wrought her as Purity from marble pure. But snatched by sudden malady out of life, She vanished, leaving that pale portraiture In sanctity of pathos to endure. Greatly the sculptor mourned her. But one day, Searching among old letters of the dead, He found, with pangs of anguish and dismay, She had never loved himâthat her love, instead, Elsewhere with affluent ardour had been shed. âAh, wiliest hypocrite!â he cried, and raised His mallet, threatening that majestic stone Whose white curves many a eulogist had praised For proofs of genius that by power unknown Such charm of chastity could so enthrone. But soon, with softening tempest of intent, Though all his desolate soul was yet astir, âNay, it shall live,â he sighed, âthe embodiment Of love's ideal, and shall to art aver Through ages my past passionate faith in her!â Time fled. Innumerous wayfarers had won That bourne of shadow and silence all shall win; Yet still with rapture did throngs gaze upon This flower of sculpture that for years had been Blossoming so stainless from a soil of sin! Florence. âBLEST BE THAT PATRIOTâ Blest be that patriot whose firm-handed might Can twist the snake of bribery till its fangs Turn on its own coils with self-murdering pangs And slay them with its own shrewd guile and spite! Sovereign, yet servant of the people's right, A chief contemptuous of all deft harangues Whose oily flattery soothes rash mobs and gangs,â History's wide page could have no grander sight. On faction's crags, where feuds in ireful foam Tumble tempestuous tides, big-packed with ill, The lamp of his large honour shines and stays: And here greeds, frauds (the sinewy birds that roam Our storm-swept sea of life to swoop and kill), Dash themselves dead against its blinding blaze. LOVE'S LITTLE DIARY Sunday To-day I found, in mischief's mood, A fair young shepherd, whom with speed Two desperate damosels pursued, Each wrangling for his tender heed. My feathery arrow's impish touch The lad's rare coldness quick had slainâ And lo, he loved them both so much He could not choose betwixt the twain. Monday To-day Sir Light-of-Heart through town Rode languid on his charger fleet, While high dames from their bowers flung down Fond glances he disdained to greet. I drew my bow; I poised its dart. .. Pert country Doris waved a hand. .. And now even less cares Light-of-Heart For all the ladies in the land. Tuesday To-day, deep-stirred by wistful ruth, A pale girl, in the cypressed gloom, Knelt sorrowing near a gentle youth, Stretched Romeo-like beside a tomb. I wrought my archery's pranksome spell, And lingeringly, ere set of sun, This Romeo had found out there dwell More Juliets in the world than one. Wednesday To-day where grouped like rusty spears Dry reeds below the misted skies, I saw Queen Summer chide with tears King Autumn in his conqueror guise. His rule she spurned; he scorned her charms; Fierce clashed they, till two shafts I sped. .. Then soon in Autumn's pitying arms Poor Summer bowed her sovereign head. Thursday To-day I chanced upon a maid Who crouched beside a woodland well, With rapture-lighted look that strayed Where sweet her own reflection fell. Such rank self-worship roused my spleen. .. The clumsiest oaf came rambling by. .. Henceforth with fervours fiery-keen For him she lives, for him would die. Friday To-day it pleased my whim to join A dungeoned miser, grey and spare, Who slowly counted coin by coin With greedy clutch and fevered glare. His dear dead sweetheart's fleshly mould Re-sentient to his sight I gave ... Swift at my feet he swept his gold, And cowered before me like a slave. Saturday To-day I chose, at early dawn, Through palace walls unseen to float, And watch, from draperies half withdrawn, The sleeping princess, Ivory Throat. With airy kiss I brushed her cheek, Then backward sprang, a wondering elfâ Since I, Love, I (O fate unique!) Had fallen in love with her myself! WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY The family coach, in cumbrous pride, Rolls creaking through the verdant lane. Demure and sweet she sits beside Her portly parent, Lady Jane. In rank her peer, though poor of purse, He notes her while she nearer draws, And flings an acrimonious curse At lucre's desolating laws. âOh, shameâ (his wrath and scorn rewake), âTo shatter thus a maid's pure life! So meek a pearl of girls to make Lord Steeplechaser's purchased wife!â A furtive glance, and lo, 'tis done; She hears his heart's unspoken prayer: âThe Romilly elm at set of sunâ Dear Marian, will you meet me there?â From her shy lids one starrier glow The alert assent has full confessed. He hears her love's voice whispering low: âDear Algy, I will do my best!â BORROWED PLUMES Once through an ancient garden, Austere and with solemn strides, Death came stalking where Laughter Was holding both her sides. The sound was so unfamiliar That he heard it with bated breath; For strange indeed was all music Of mirth to the ears of Death. Yet the silvery trill entranced him As it leaped from the lips of the elf, And he tried, like a clumsy mimic, To laugh the same way himself. But the only sound he could utter Was so raucous with hates and sneers, That while Death broke into laughter, Poor Laughter burst into tears. VENICE Great lute, once played upon by history's hand, But now lying indolent, with shattered shell; Proud lily of civic pomp, whose floral spell, Once daybreak's own, wears now such withering brand; High sovereignty disthroned, whose lost command The Campanile's thunder-throated bell, The erratic sea-gull's cry, can fitliest knell;â What speech may voice thy sorrow, obscure yet grand? Court, campo and palace glimmer bleared and wan; Weeds fringe the marble of stairways, bridges, piers; Dank labyrinths of canals crawl everywhere Through squalor, desuetude!âO dying swan, Thy death-song, freighted with five centuries' tears, Flutes o'er the Adriatic its despair! Venice, 1898. LONDON Haunted by all the historic smiles and tears Of many a great soul vanished into space, Tomb of prides, aims and passions, pure or base, Yet theatre where life loudly domineers, From fabulous epochs through a thousand years Of battle and dear-bought peace your annals trace, Till now (on earth man's mightiest meeting-place) Your vastness this columnar fame uprears! In fogs of noonday night, in rains and sleets, In yellow and silver mists, or suns blood-red, Or violet alps of cloud, deep charm I see, ... For always through your monstrous maze of streets, With steps unechoing, walk your Deathless Dead, O city of ghosts, that can so ghostly be! FOUR CHORUSES I CHORUS OF UNTHINKING TOILERS Through years and years, Fate's living jeers, We've soaked our blood in bread and tears. What wonder now If bold of brow Its nauseous vileness we avow? Go, search the spots Where squalor squats, Custodian of our loathsome lots; Then dare to blame The frenzied shame That riotous in revolt would flame. Then dare to tell If life may dwell This side the grave in ghastlier hell; Then dare to speak, Ye rich and sleek, Of tolerance that should make us meek. From dens of slums Our chorus comes, From penury's pale martyrdoms. To judge us fair Would be to share The abysmal deeps of our despair. We, reared in dearth, Dull rabble of earth, Were branded prisoners at our birth. To each befell, As each learned well, The heirloom of a dungeon cell. On each the curse Was wreaked adverse Of ragged beggary for his nurse; To each the cheer Of want's chill sneer Became his cradle and swaddling-gear. While new suns rise, Our roaming eyes Glare haggard at the unaidful skies. While new suns fade Our worn feet wade Through rubble and slush whose filths degrade. No more we heed, In our strong need, Mild-murmuring patience if she plead; With maxims wise In vain she sighs For suffering to philosophise. Nay, is it strange Our fancies range Through visions of volcanic change? Or that intrigue Would vengeance league To attest our terrible fatigue? Shrewd tongues may prate That this hot hate Its mad self would annihilate; Yet captive pain At least would gain Some transient shattering of its chain. Ah, sweet to stray Through frantic fray For even one red tempestuous day! Ah, sweet to shower, For one wild hour, The slaves' wrath on the despot's power! II CHORUS OF SO-CALLED CHRISTIANS Do not heed their foolish plaints; Dense they teem with envious taints. Chaste religion's holy dawn Spurn they, anarchy's dull spawn. When we bid them to endure, Their responses rise impure. Blasphemy their speech outrolls That appals our Christian souls. They have often dared to claim We are Christians but in name. They have insolently said: âNot for such as you Christ bled.â Mouthing at us, in coarse glee, His âLeave all and follow me,â They have insolently cried Shame upon our greed and pride. âPah! You Christians?â they have scoffed, âHoused in ease, clad warm and soft, âGiving from your golden store Stray gratuities, and no more? âTell us, would such boons be priced Precious in the eyes of Christ? âWas not this the creed that taught Self-disdain in deed and thought? âEach He loved in like degree, Sacrifice and charity. Slight the second would He rate If the first were not its mate. âGive not save the gift be blent With your own impoverishment. âGive not save at heart ye choose From your feet to strip the shoes. âGive not save the mood invoke From your back to pluck the cloak. âThis is Christ, and this alone His clear doctrine, blood and bone. âIf ye spurn such holy thrall, Best ye did not give at all. âTake some other creed, and be Buddhist, Mussulman, Parsee, âBrahman, Jew, so ye evade This coarse Christian masquerade!â Thus the raucous cries have rung, Hot from many a reckless tongue. We but hold them void of sense, Pitying their impertinence. Serious heed we scarce have lent Their anarchical ferment. We not Christians?âwe that pray Night and morn in holiest way! We that reverently brood On our own rare rectitude; Aid the poor, and yet restrain Prodigalities insane; Love our neighbour, yet disclose No grand philanthropic pose; Lie not, steal not, do, in fact, All that Scripture's laws exact! âNay, with idiot rant let these Blusterers prattle what they please! How could Christ, alive to-day, Our gentility gainsay, Or demand that we should flee From respectability! Altered lands and altered skies He Himself would recogniseâ Years wherethrough fresh thoughts have ranged, Habits, fashions, customs changed. Nineteen centuries' gloom and shine Part New York from Palestine; Hold at each far-sundered hem London and Jerusalem; Broad in severance, verge from verge Hudson and Euphrates urge; Thames and Jordan, tide from tide, Incontestably divide. âWherefore, at thy throne-foot now, Heavenly Hierarch, we bow, Feeling thine approval sure Of our decorous lives and pure; Confident thou wilt not think Duty and piety we blink, For the simple cause that we Take religion rationally, Nor its precious codes attire In cheap spangles and red fire. III CHORUS OF THINKING TOILERS We scorn the insurgence of that shriek Which far too oft is flung From feverish lips that only speak With acrimonious tongue; No more we crave, no more we plead Than Justice would herself concede. The lands are loud, the lands are hot With hates of ravenous rage; The labourer loathes his drudging lot, He loathes his vassalage; He learns at last his own large power, He longs to make his tyrants cower. Yet we, rough labour's burly brood, That ache in thew and bone, The murderous paroxysmal mood Disfavour and disown; We rate as weapons weak and slight Incendiarism and dynamite. At learning's font stray draughts we drank, Yet sweet as May's mild rains; Deep in our thirsting souls they sank And vitalised our veins. Invaluable the draught to us, For its ennobling stimulus! The rare elixir cleared our glance, Like sunshine scattering snow; Mankind must cope with ignorance And lay its cohorts low. Life hath no genie, luck no elf, To help him till he helps himself. 'Tis vain to dream our freedom's day Fortuitously shall rise; Millennial morrows long delay The bloom of their bright skies; From darkness and turmoil are drawn The peace and splendour of their dawn. A century since, beyond the sea, Our motto and watchword flamed; Of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity 'twas framed. Where battle and massacre prevailed, It towered unsoiled and unassailed. But though man's mind hath striven to free His fate from creeds unsound, Though liberty and equality In largess he hath found, Still doth fraternity remain Thus far his unaccomplished gain. Sweet thoughts of help may haunt his ken, But these coarse interests gloom; Men do not love their fellow-men, Howe'er they so assume. We paupers, prospering by their aid, Know just how grudgingly 'tis paid. They love us not; their happier lives Are swayed by severing powers; They love their parents, children, wives, As we in turn love ours; Why blame their souls if unenticed By the grand altruism of Christ? That rigorous and divine unrest Obeys but one clear call; Spontaneous throbs it in the breast, Or fails to throb at all; More firm than subterranean gold, The future doth its fires enfold. Rich beauty of its unrisen day, While time's tides onward sweep, Our children's children's children may Inestimably reap. For us the hid seeds torpid cower; For them shall blaze the effulgent flower. âThey serve who only stand and wait,â Sang Milton, long ago. Our toil is harsh; our need is great; Our trust in heaven ebbs low; We wait, yet ah! not idly stand; We bow tired back, ply wearied hand. Complaint is fatuous; wrath even worse; Revolts fresh wrongs evolve; We can but hope the unholy curse In blessing may dissolveâ In bounteous blessing without flawâ When Love grows universal law! IV CHORUS OF EVERYDAY OPTIMISTS âHeigh! the stream of pompous prattle! Ho! the gush of high-flown tattle! Life 's a bow to bravely bend; Life 's a coin to wisely spend. We, for all that say us nay, Answer: âFolderolderado,â Answer: âFolderolderay!â âWhy, if you 've with want fought vainly, Scold society insanely? How may any man dare think That the world should wait his wink? We, to all who claim he may, Toss our âFolderolderado,â Fling our âFolderolderay.â âTrue, it 's heartily distressful Not to find one's self successful; Yet you'll scarce revoke missed aims Calling skilled shots ugly names. All such babble is apt to weigh Light asâfolderolderado, Light asâfolderolderay. âIf the rich and poor were equals, How absurd would be the sequels! Millionaire and pauper peers, Where would work find volunteers? Each man toil so long each day? Pooh! mere folderolderado! Pah! mere folderolderay! âSocialism 's a madhouse revel; Anarchy 's a masquing devil. Greet your joys; accept your cares; Go to church and say your prayers. Every other earthly way Is but folderolderado, Is but folderolderay! âRead good books, but writing sceptic Hold obnoxious and dyspeptic; It can ne'er (wise, witty or terse) Re-create the universe. When such task it would essay Cry it âFolderolderado,â Cry it âFolderolderay!â âSwing to men like Herbert Spencer No encomiastic censer; Darwin, Huxley, Tyndall, bring No devout burnt-offering. If you hear they 've âcome to stay,â Laugh your âFolderolderado,â Laugh your âFolderolderay! âProffer all time-worn traditions Your unqualified submissions; Gaze askance at silly storms Big with picturesque reforms. Quick their bubbles, glittering gay, Turn to folderolderado, Turn to folderolderay! âTake the world as you have found it; Neither seek to gauge nor sound it. In this one stanch maxim rest: Everything that is, is best. You'll but follow, if thence you stray, Wraiths likeâfolderolderado, Ghosts likeâfolderolderay!â A MILLIONAIRE'S FUNERAL Stand with me here where these rich draperies fall, Shadowing this alcoved orchid. We can mark The costly and simple coffin, and the face It holds, part visible, with waxen brow And pale pinched nostrils, from the satined sides. This was a bad man. (Start not; I speak low.) For years he clad his life in sordidness, The idolater of gain. He played with chance Like the coarse gambler, rattling random dice, Brooding o'er slippery and fortuitous cards. Yet loftier was heâgrander, if you pleaseâ Just as an arch-fiend might above his imps Loom in sheer evil. Dice and cards to him Were fluctuant millions, ever lost or won In that gross bevy of gamesters not far off, Our New York Wall Street. Rainbow-tinted dreams Of some half-baby Aladdin might not cope With his gold splendours of rank loot and luck. Anarchy spawned him. The metropolis Reeked, in his youth, with those vile fumes of fraud Which mean the lingering fever-heats that fold A nation while it wakes from war's hot trance. He seized the occasion; judges had grown base Barterers of justice; these he bribed with zeal. The rulers of his land had flung in slime Their sacred national trust, and these he lured To infamies. His railroads poured their steam With big vuluminous deceptive clouds Into the people's eyes. Throngs watched him wear The stolen insignia of philanthropy And gaped, some reverent, some with covert scorn. This was a bad man. If America Had more such insolent egotists as he, Heaven save our proud republic! Their cold souls Are ice whose chill would freeze all patriot warmth Which pulsed, a century since, in our loved land. Between himself and many an outcast doomed To shorn head and guilt's flaring livery dwells One difference: they were thieves begot of slums; He was the statelier kind of thief that stole Pictoriallyâa Claud Duval who drave The pistol-muzzle of his brigandage Into the vehicle-window of the Stateâ A fierce Dick Turpin of finance, who clothed His crime in galliard swagger, tinged it red With bluff romanticism. As ripe result, You see the mass abhor one thief and lift The other to that same bad eminence Glorious dead Milton made his Satan scale. Dare we to doubt the civic wrong he wrought? Perchance the mob doubts, but the mob has gone Sheep-like and plaintless for so many a year Into the shambles of gross bigot faiths Built for it by such despot slaughterers! ... Mark! The clergyman comes now; draw back a step. Ah, how incongruous that the saintly name Of Christ should sound above this greed-racked flesh! Still, charity is the noblest human trait; Let us have mercy on him at this last hour; Let us recall the age that moulded him; Let us be mindful of heredity, With all its deadly and subtle flows of force. This railroad-wrecker, this corruptionist, This bane of widow and orphan whose past tears Have dropped so copious that if all were blent, Their salt tides might have drowned him, this dacoit, Revelling in cut-purse arrogance ... who knows The mystic ante-natal trends that met To make him what he was? A scorpion tempts Our loathing, not our spleen; we shun it, packed With venomous ill, nor think to blame the sting It carries. That we accept, like destiny. See yonder pale girl at the coffin's edge, With bright hair brighter from her garb's black folds; His only child. Of all his kith or kin Alone she is left, too. Note her plaintive eyes Brim with large tears, like over-plenteous dew Burdening twin blooms. At least this delicate girl Has loved him, and can weep that he is dead! Perchance no life was ever lived in vain If just one sentient human soul could grieve Above its grave. ... And yet even Nero dead (Save history blunders) knew such fate benign. Well, better we should lapse not, you and I, Into harsh dictatorial pessimisms. They serve no end. We'll both stay merciful. Come; the crowd parts; the coffin-lid has fallen: Once more dust claims this towering plutocrat. LITERATURE Four are the sovereign arts that echoes call Out from those large dim deeps, our human heart; But yet the inclusive magic of one art, While being allied to each, transcends them all. Here rhythms and melodies rise, pause or fall Perpetual; here hues, tinges, gleam or start With rainbow glory; and here, too, hold their part Form, symmetry, twin powers of cogent thrall. With marvel of colour Painting may delight; Music the wings of our pent souls may free; Sculpture may charm us with high dreams and pure; But thou that mirrorest the beauty and might, The delicacy and splendour of all three, Still than all three art loftier, Literature! SURRENDER Come, my Despair; 'tis either fight or truce; I will not longer bear thy thrall one hour! I will not watch thee lying, as 'twas her use To lie, in yonder cushioned alcove's gloom, And mark thee shame with the white spectral flower Of thy loathed face the lovely and living bloom Of hers! Thou shalt not borrow, austere Despair, The flutterings of her garment on my floor, Nor ape the lily of her uplifted hand; Thou shalt not, in thy marble mockery, wear The dear dishevelled mutinies of her hair! Nay, as entreaty and tears alike were vain, So fight proves failure, truce thy look doth greet With blankness drearier than waste arctic snow! Come, then, Despair, since thou wilt have it so: I break at last my rebel sword in twain, I fling its powerless fragments at thy feet. Her face, her form, her presence, till I die, Usurp thou with imperious travesty! A VENETIAN HONEYMOON For us the marvel and magic have not flown That once were Venice in her palmy prime; For us bloom taintless from the blights of time Her pale mediÃ¦valisms of sculptured stone. As though mysteriously for us alone, Piazzetta and San Marco blend like rhyme Their festal pomps; for us the church-bells chime Dead hours, and shadowy Doges re-enthrone! The past its beauty accords us, not its tears; Lagoon, canal, street, campo are fairied thus, And Lido, and all her sweet calm sister isles. But where the Riva is massed with gondoliers, To-day reasserts itself, and lo, for us, The Bridge of Sighs becomes the Bridge of Smiles! Venice. THE STRUGGLER Zealots, philosophers, makers of creeds, Infidels, pantheists, makers of doubt, Hear me, the Struggler; I lift up my voice, I, of the universe impulse immense, I, coexistent with time and with space. Formless yet multiform, ever I strive, Blazing in suns or uproarious in seas, Torpid in worms or in tigers alert, Lissome in lilies or stalwart in oaks, Riotous in thunder or lyric in birds. Shapeless yet palpable, age after age Yearn I insatiate through world upon world, Always by throes of supreme discontent Harried and thwarted, from mammoth to gnat, Balked and defeated, from grass-blade to pine. Resolute, obstinate, still do I strive; For the imperious purpose I hold Millions of failures have failed to disturb. Nay, since already, on stars that I know, Up sheer through brute have I pushed into man. I, the endeavour, the spirit, the will, I that am All yet that aim to be One, I that on boundless experiment thrive, I, unabashed by enormous rebuff, I, having made Man, at last shall make God. A BOY'S THOUGHTS OF LIFE The years have left me a boy no longer; yet boyhood lingers in breast and brain,â Dear careless boyhood, that soon must perish, and clothe its parting with tender pain! A few more morrows, and I shall wonder how mirth and frolic so long could stay,â From skies familiar the same sun shining, yet ah, not shining the same sweet way! 'Tis no real sadness that steals to warn me; it half is pleasure and half regret, As though a welcome had met a farewell, and intermingled when they had met. For while gay fancies may from the future delight and longing my spirit bring, I'm like a nestling whose wings unfolded feel yet the nest-warmth about them cling. This life that waits me, I yearn to know it; my heart is with it, my hope is there; The large winds float it across my forehead, with tingle of nostrils, caress of hair. It moves in mornings; it speaks in starlight; it lurks in sunset's fantastic hues; I hear it murmur through swaying tree-tops; I watch it sparkle from roadside dews! All nature tells me my altered impulse, my manhood's heirdoms to gifts unguessed; The streams in flowing, the blooms in blowing, are rich with prophecies half-confessed! I listen, I tremble with expectation; the secret answer I vainly plead! To learn that answer is to have lived it;âto live it nobly were life indeed! LANDSCAPE IN SOME OTHER PLANET The sun, that eastward drops, pours purplish lights On blood-red foliage by dense woods outrolled, Till fiercely with long level rays he smites A towering mountain shaped from solid gold. White gloaming spills erelong its noiseless damps On sweeps of ebon grass by faint wind stirred, And lo, through yonder thicket softly tramps A monstrous mild-eyed thing, half beast, half bird. In glooms of heaven, while day still eastward dies, The dim discs of strange alien stars are seen, And nowâah, look!ânorth, south and west uprise Three mighty moons, two violet and one green! HELEN, OLD There, in my mirror's gloss of steel, Jeers the gaunt mockery I am grown. For me did heroes bleed and reel? For me was Ilium overthrown? For me did Greece, in those wild years, Throng her dark ships with wrathful spears? Did grand Achilles, frowning doom, Slay glorious Hector, and then drag His body about Patroclus' tomb For me, this bony and withered hag? For these blanched lips and locks of snow Did tides of scarlet slaughter flow? This wreck with beauty a brief sweet while, Ah, pitying goddess, re-endow! Give me again the auroral smile, The sunlight hair, the moonlight brow, The heaven of eyes, the heaven of headâ Then, if thy mood wills, dash me dead! THE PAWNBROKER In some grim purlieu doth he dwell, that seems Always through tricks of sorcery midnight's lair; Above his door, in lamplight's dubious beams, Darts out one shadowy word that reads âDespair.â With marble face, with quick insidious hand Whose fingers glide like pale snakes to and fro, Behind his dark-barred grating doth he stand, To meet the timorous forms that come and go. Each with some treasured offering that allures His look, and wins from it satanic glee, These vague and variant forms are mine, are yours, Yes, even are thousands' wild and weak as we! Love, pride, hope, honour, fame, year after year We pawn him, by infatuate ardours urged, Then grasp the coin he doles, and disappear Back to the swallowing gloom whence we emerged. But oft, with pay close-clutched, while hurrying o'er His threshold, bent on our fleet homeward course, We cast one farewell glance at his dim door, And in the flickering lamplight read âRemorse.â CLOUDED NIGHTS Nights clothed in dense cloud I have rarely seen But subtle and vague remonstrance thrilled me through, Fain to unveil that vault of heavenly blue Where myriad swarms of shining worlds convene. Why, being so brief and transient, should life screen Our vision from one hour's dear chance to view This meadow of heaven whose dusk so guards its dew In diamond immobility serene? Unpitying for those tireless eyes that toil The devious deeds of stars to scan and trace, Are clouds whence no sweet beam shall dare to burst; Since, ah, not even a single night should foil The soul of Science, harrying time and space With all its glory of hunger and of thirst! HOPE Blithe portress at the gateways of the soul! Dear sycophant, that dost so fondly cling To even our worst of sorrows! Bark whose wing Dauntlessly voyages to illusion's goal, Heedless if it be shadow, if rock and shoal! White bird that carollest unwearying Trebles of song, like those by new-born spring Lured skyward from some blossom-tinted knoll! Ah, Hope, thou art sweet when mad seas glass wild skies, When war, pest, earthquake riots in bitter glee, Or yet when tyranny tortures and enslaves; But sweetest when thy shape phantasmal flies, A will-o'-the-wisp named Immortality, Over the darkness of earth's myriad graves! PAVEMENT PICTURES Wild storm, this languid summer night, Clashed o'er the city an hour ago; But now, released in heaven's blue height, A moon has brought her sorrowing glow, To flood the massed roofs' dimness dense With pale celestial penitence. The breeze wakes rich in soothing damps; Faint spires loom silvered; and one sees In street or square, by rain-splashed lamps, The wet leaves flickering on stray trees; While black fantastic shapes of dream Bold from the drying pavements gleam. Chance moods of moisture's random change, The dumb stone flaunts their blots grotesque, Where freaks of spectral traceries range Through many an elfin arabesqueâ Till the huge town's vice, crime, despair, Seems devilishly pictured there. TRAFFIC Life, the shrewd lapidary, is rich in wares Whose worth our casual glances may decree; And like perpetual purchasers are we, Won by the bounteous opulence he airs. Here shines a pearl of hope; here subtly glares An emerald of revenge; here thrilled we see A diamond of ambition; here may be Some ruby of sin that lures us and ensnares. Incessantly above this bright array, As time flows on, we mortals flock to bend, Till body and limbs turn frail, till brows grow grey, Through trading, haggling, bartering without endâ While for the inexorable price we pay, Months, years, even centuries, are the coins we spend. WAYNE AT BRANDYWINE The autumn dawn was dim with mists on that disastrous day; With dews like tears the oaks were strung, below still skies of grey. In fringy throngs the stirless pines were gloomed as with regret; The clustering laurels glimpsed no ray from foliage dark and wet. All earth and heaven, in blended pain, seemed prescient of the ills That war would shower erelong on those green Pennsylvanian hills. The sun crept higher in mantling fog; the battle growled and broke; You heard its thunderous onslaughts crash; you saw them blaze and smoke. From Osbourne's Hill Cornwallis rushed, with troops of well-tried power; He dreamed not then, this high-born Earl, of Yorktown's humbling hour. He scanned our shabby and rebel hordes, nor dared to rate them peers Of all his dexterous infantry, chasseurs and grenadiers. Hurling his trained battalions down, he deemed their might anon Would crush like gnats the astounded bands of Greene and Washington. Yet these with zeal struck firmly back, defiant of hope's eclipse, And bade the scarlet tongues of flame lick their black cannons' lips. Like some fleet silvery mountain stream their serried bayonets flashed, As with the impetuous foe above they sternly closed and clashed. In furious wise fought Sullivan (whose blunders heaven forget!); Down from his steed, with rallying shouts, leaped fiery Lafayette. De Gorre and Conway strained and strove; so, too, with high-waved sword, Lord Stirling, falsely titled thus, though every inch a lord. Fierce waxed the fray on blood-soaked turf; in sheets the bullets flew; A battle of men it ceased to be, a battle of tigers grew. Artillery clamoured on the slopes, from sheltering rocks and trees; Artillery from the meadows roared voluminous repartees. One storm of sound, as though in words, tempestuous challenge threw: âGod save King George the Third and blast all traitorous droves like you!â One answering storm of equal sound, as though in words, rang then: âGo back and tell your idiot King we are not slaves, but men!â Meanwhile at Chad's Ford, vigilant, a sombre warrior stood, Light glittering from his hazel eyes, though marble seemed his mood. A stalwart shape in buff and blue, he noted without sign The hirelings of Knyphausen mass beside the Brandywine. Roods off he saw, with stolid mien, the reddening river glow, And knew the precious patriot blood ensanguining its flow. Erewhile from vaporous rifts of sky one slanted beam had filled Pulaski's dark proud Polish face, by glorious courage thrilled. And reared beyond him, it had shown, that same bright random beam, The loftier form of Washington, in dignity supreme. A form this watcher by the bridge beheld with bated breathâ A form he would have died to shield from such engirding death. He looked along the Brandywine; he marked, in ominous ranks, The fierce dragoons of Anspach wheel beside its willowy banks. What menace ruled their mustering scores he read with rapid ease, Then vaulted on the sinewy roan that neighed to feel his knees. A thousand hardy followers heard his voice quick mandates throw, And sprang to obey them as the shaft will spring to obey the bow. âMad Anthonyâ he oft was named, yet these that knew him best, What method in his madness lay had learned with loving zest. And each was keen, with him for chief, to front war's harms and smartsâ Tatterdemalions, if you will, but all with heroes' hearts. Accoutred rich in black-and-gold by black plumes overspread, Five thousand rancorous Hessians poured, Knyphausen at their head. Ah, not in legend or in song does lordlier daring shine Than this, the intrepid countercharge of Wayne at Brandy-wine. Riflemen, horsemen, stanch alike, the greybeard by the youth, His rabble of Continentals rushed, magnificent, uncouth. Straight on tornado-wise they tore, and bluffly set at naught The butchering tactics, deft and shrewd, that British pounds had bought. Splendid for bravery did they smite, and bleed, and kill, and die, With country, honour, home and kin their blows to sanctify. And even in teeth of such harsh odds the prize perchance were won, If prudence had not pushed from fight the army of Washington. Afar, through lurid air Wayne saw, with pangs of sharp dismay, His dear Commander's trusted troops retire in broken array. Then full amid thick hail of shot, with victory almost gained, Back on its haunches, in a trice, his good brown steed he reined. Veering, he signalled swift recoil, howe'er his pride it stung, And with vociferous resonance these words broadcast he flung: âSuperior numbers have o'erwhelmed our main force with defeat; We follow (it is our sacred task!) protecting their retreat!â He bade them leave their dying and deadâtheir guns, munitions, allâ He steeled his heart, he bowed his head, to duty's claim and call. And though from bearded Teuton lips the insulting laughter pealed, He did not heed, but swept his men sheer on to Dilworth field. And there, with many a gallant blade uplifted in the sun, He grandly guarded the retreat of Greene and Washington! 'Twere easy, in sooth, to snatch the palm from triumph's outstretched hand, Yet oh, how hard, at wisdom's will, such guerdon to withstand! Nay, for that high-strung spirit, I know, renouncement brought reward Past all his prowess at Stony Point, his pluck at Jamestown Ford! Ah, not in story or myth or song does deed more stoic shine Than this, the exalted self-control of Wayne at Brandywine! TO ROBERT G. INGERSOLL Thou hast peered at all creeds of the past, and each one hath seemed futile and poor As a firefly that fades on a marsh, as a wind that makes moan on a moor; For thy soul in its large love to man, in its heed of his welfare and cheer, Bids him hurl to the dust whence they sprang all idolatries fashioned by fear. Not the eagle can gaze at the sun with more dauntless and challenging eyes Than thou at the radiance of truth when it rifts the dark durance of lies. From thy birth wert thou tyranny's foe, and its deeds were disdain in thy sight; Thou art leagued with the dawn as the lark isâlike him dost thou leap to the light! Having marked how the world's giant woes for the worst part are bigotry's brood, Thou hast hated, yet never with malice, and scorned but in service of good. Thy compassionate vision saw keen how similitude always hath dwelt Between fumes poured from altars to God and from flames haggard martyrs have felt. What more splendid a pity than thine for the anguish thy race hath endured Through allegiance to spectres and wraiths from the cohorts of fancy conjured? At the bold pomps of temple and church is it wonder thy wisdom hath mourned, Since the architect, Ignorance, reared them, and Fright, the pale sculptor, adorned? But sterner thy loathing and grief that the priesthoods have shamed not to tell Of an infinite vengeance enthroned in the heart of an infinite hell; That they shrank not to mould from void air an Omnipotence worship should heed, And yet clothed it with ruffian contempt for the world's multitudinous need! Thy religion is loftier than theirs; nay, with vehement lips hast thou said Its foundations are rooted in help to the living and hope for the dead. All eternity's richest rewards to a spirit like thine would prove vain, Were it sure of but one fellow-mortal that writhed in unperishing pain. Like a mariner drifted by night where tempestuous wracks overshade Every merciful star that perchance might with silvery pilotage aid, Resolution and vigilance each close-akin as thy heart-beat or breath, Dost thou search in thy courage and calm the immense chartless ocean of death. There are phantoms of ships that lurch up, and thou seÃ«st them and art not allured By their masts made of glimmering dream, by their bulwarks from cloudland unmoored; For the helmsmen that steer them are mist, and the sails they are winged with, each one, By the feverish hands of fanatics on looms of delusion are spun. At the vague stems are visages poised that in variant glimpses appear. .. Here the swart and imperial Osiris, the crescent-crowned Mahomet here; Or again, mystic Brahma, with eyes full of omens, monitions, and vows; Or again, meek and beauteous, the Christ, with the blood-crusted thorns on his brows. But thou sayest in thy surety to all: âEmpty seemings, pass onward and fade!â ... Not by emblems and symbols of myth wert thou born to be tricked and betrayed; For aloof o'er the desolate blank thou discernest, now dubious, now plain, The expanse of one sheltering shoreland, worth ardours untold to obtain. Full of promise, expectancy, peace, in secure sequestration it lies, Undismayed by a menace of storm from its arch of inscrutable skies. ... Canst thou reach it, strong sea-farer? ... Yes! for the waves are thy bondsmen devout. Look! they wash thee safe-limbed on its coast, clinging firm to thy tough spar of doubt! Roam at large in its glorious domain; from its reaches night half has withdrawn; Over inlet, bay, meadow, and creek broods the delicate damask of dawn; Roam at large; 'tis a realm thou shouldst love; 'tis the kingdom where Science reigns king; In its lapses of grove and of greensward sleeps many a crystalline spring. To the eastward are mountains remote, with acclivities towering sublime: The repose of their keen virgin peaks mortal foot hath not ventured to climb. In their bastions and caverns occult, in their bleak lairs of glacier and stream, There are treasures more copious and costly than fable hath yet dared to dream. Thou shalt see not their splendours, for fate may retard through long ages the hour That in bounteous bestowal at last shall mankind inconceivably dower. Yet thy prophecies err not, O sage; thou divinest what wealth shall outpour When exultant those proud heights of knowledge posterity sweeps to explore. Not for thee, not for us, those dear days! In oblivion our lots will be cast When the future hath built firm and fair on the bulk of a petrified past. Yet its edifice hardier shall bide for the boons fraught with help that we giveâ For the wrongs that we cope with and slay, for the lies that we crush and outlive. And if record of genius like thine, or of eloquence fiery and deep, Shall remain to the centuries regnant from centuries lulled into sleep, Then thy memory as music shall float amid actions and aims yet to be, And thine influence cling to life's good as the sea-vapours cling to the sea! TO A YOUNG VERSIFIER A slender book of lyrics you have printed, Echoing the famous bards you most esteem; Yet woe betide the man who shall have hinted Its authenticity is not supreme! With scorn austere, with prejudice in plenty, Your moods toward fellow-singers are replete;â Last January you were three-and-twenty, Though seventy in your own sublime conceit. For life has no dark deeps that your bold plummets Of self-believed experience do not dare; No laurel thrives on calm Parnassian summits Too green or bounteous for your brows to bear. Thrice-blest, indeed, if you should deign to prize him, The poet of this dull age you scarce endure! And yet, if Shakespeare lived, you'd patronise him, And grieve that Hamlet should be so âobscure.â NOCTES DOLOROSAE At the might of the night when its light and its gloom Have been blent like the scent and the tinge of a bloom, At the might of the night while its height is one haze From the stars it unbars out of darkness, we gaze,â Till our pain like the strain of a god's voice would smite On the might of the night, on the might of the night. Keen-possessed by a quest whose unrest seems to roam All the might of the night from its base to its dome, Fierce-possessed by a quest that would wrest what we miss From the might of the night in its lift or abyss, Our despair like the flare of a god's wrath takes flight Through the might of the night, through the might of the night. COINCIDENCE Where these waste winter swamplands quaff A brackish creek's chill ooze and drain, The uncouth poles of the telegraph Loom spangled thick with frozen rain. Careless of each rude blast that stings, A bevy of birds, in tumult fleet, Shower down upon the ice-clad strings And clutch them with courageous feet. And now, below the sky's harsh gleams, In teeth of gusts whence discord floats, A monstrous bar of music seems To tower, with birds' black shapes for notes. Then, radiant where the steel-grey west Has drowsed like some stern arctic lake, Roughening it into glad unrest, The obtrusive sun's broad splendours break. On the strange emblem full they dash The glory of their fresh-kindled fires, Till visible music seems to flash And fade along the illumined wires! ANDRÃE Far where the daybreak's domains beyond porches of pearl are reposing, Wanders with bravery and buoyance the lark in its passion for light; Far where steep hills are to heaven all their tumults of silence disclosing, Float the huge condors round peaks which no thunderbolt's ravage may smite. Yet since the wisdom of man could its fables from history sever, Since from miraculous valour was torn the impossible palm, Still more adventurous thou, in the dash of thy peerless endeavour, Bankrupting courage with prowess, and shattering frenzy to calm. Angers of sky, land or sea thou hast daunted alike in thy daring, Poised on thy perilous craft between tempests aloft or below, Whirled toward the bleak polar glooms whence auroras are rosily flaring, Swept where the sun hangs appalled o'er illimited stagnance of snow. Thine was the purpose, the project, that veiled as with volumes of splendour Tawdrier glories and honours, chance-garnered where battlefields blaze; Thine the ambition that bounded, in flush of superb self-surrender, Past all the tinsels and spangles man loots from his fratricide frays. Laud not the captains that kill or the soldiers whom slaughter hath sated; Here was a captaincy spotless and here was a soldiership high; Broad though the doom of our death, 'tis alone with divinity freighted When for large help to the living unsullied by bloodshed we die. If thou indeed art no more, flung to earth from thy dome of defiance, Warrior of warfare so matchless, meteor so fervid of flame, Have not the winds and the waters achieved thee in stately alliance Elegies, eulogies, obsequies, meet for so mighty a name? Nay, among lands thou hast left, with requital and requiem blending, Memory shall bide monumental and grief despite pain shall be proud: Yonder in lands that beheld thine austere and magnificent ending,â Ice for thy sepulchre, blast for thy mourners, and frost for thy shroud! KNOW THYSELF Know thyself, said the old Greek. Obey his hest Invaluable. With hand that swerves no jot, Lift thou the torch of knowledge and roam on Through all those devious corridors that branch Darkly below thy labyrinthine soul. Leave not one cranny or nook unvisited. As though, some reverend monk, thy feet should break The calm of some long-slumbering catacomb, Peer in this niche whose dusk may hide a skull, Delve in this pit where vermin broods may nest. With torch firm-gripped prowl onward, prowl and stare, Till all thy soul's dread coigns of evil-doing Are mercilessly envisaged. Search each lair That peradventure some base tenant shields, And flash on each, howe'er they toadlike squat, Serpentlike coil, or batlike cling, or crawl Wormlike, thy cresset's tyrannous blaze of quest. So much of this weird edifice, thy soul, Deep-rooted in creation's mysteries, Thou shalt have learned. Yet be thou not content With wanderings through these crypts of grosser build, This heritage of animalism, so rank With records of the earlier ape. Ascend By yonder twilight stair to higher haunts, Where chamber sweeps toward chamber, luminous With lamps that dim thy torch, all being the abode Of intellect, thy soul's first privilege, A crowd of towers, high-bastioning thy state Above those lives unspiritual that swarm In frailty or hardihood earth's million holds. This new realm shalt thou roam with loftier mood, Among thine own mind's large palatial bounds. Reason its hall of sculptural stone waits here; There Truth its bower of gold; there tapestries Pictured with history's deeds may Justice gird; For Wisdom stateliest preparation gleams From yonder marble sanctuary. All these, And moreâthat rare imperialism we name The Virtues, thy stanch allies, aids and guides, If so thou choose to accede themâshall attend Thy summons, and their various vantages At thy decree, thine only, shall assume. Know thyself better still. Mount higher, and heed With what fine delicacy of trellisings, What loggias, galleries, belfries, balconies, Thy subterranean yet aspirant soul Can crown itself. The Emotions harbour here, In all their mutability and sweet grace. They front the billowing clouds, the bedouin gales, The oracular moon, mesmeric stars, dawns pale With fire of prophecy, and sunsets red With passion of farewell, and are kinned to these In splendour, beauty and charm of symbolism. Such bright aerial summits of thy soul May rainbow Imagination, Fancy fleet, Love, Hope, Awe, Pity and Sympathy possess, If thus thy choice, and Art, which means them all, Though Love than all hath mightier dominance. Wild birds of dream, yet quick to obey thy beck, On palisade and parapet their wings May scatter at thy command white benisons Of welcome. Yet pay rich thy fostering care, Else Love, the loveliest of them, will be first To fly, should he and every volatile mate Feed not undaunted from thy lavish hand, Crouch not elate below thy sheltering heart. So, having known thyself, abide thou firm Against the assailant and distracting world. Adore thine own idealsânot secretly, Nor timorously, but with proud nakedness. Each creed thou hast made sure thou reverencest Grasp at and fight for, though Babelian tongues May chatter about thine ears dissentience fierce. Live thou thy life; thou hast but one to live, And pedestal that upon consistency. Let not thy just wraths cower for prudence' sake; Rather unleash them, bloodhounds though they be, And watch with joy their fangs plough deep in wrong. Nay, though thou canst not kill wrong, once to have plunged A dirk of odium past its callous hide Spurs by this act intrepid myriads Abominative as thou of its brute reign. Having once loved the good in thee and spurned The ill, stay incontestibly thyself. Slavery has vanished; kindred shames have died; Others endure. If these thou dost abhor, Strike at them, even with maimed and bleeding hands. If thou detestest war, as all men should, Make monumental thine antipathy; Intoxicate thyself with loathing of it; Give policy's least mood of protean guile No quarter. Sound one note, and vary it not, While tumults of insidious âifsâ and âthoughs,â Like locust-legions loudening as they swell, Would buzz and hiss thee mute. Even so with Caste, With despotisms of Capital, with laws Perverted and evaded, briberies, pacts To filch the labourer's loafâquick dagger-blows That wealth, turned cut-throat, may creep up to deal In the back of prostrate poverty. Should harms Freighted like these with poison, breed thy hate, Shower out such hate from every duct and sluice Of thine indignant spirit, shower it out Unstintedly, torrentially, and cleave Its onslaught with thy scorn's hot lightnings. Think: Thine individual span is but a day; Posterity is for aeons; help its weal, If only a mite of betterment shall bide As earnest of thine effort. Interblend Thy conscience and conviction till the twain Are twinned like flower to fragrance. Ocean's waste Hath not one star in its huge canopy Whose pilotage is radianter than theirs. ÅDIPUS AND THE SPHINX âThis way, Lysander,â shouted Ådipus, âWhy tarriest thou inert? Here, where these bluff crags glisten against the blue, Our fated path sheers. Come! A hollow of rock is twisted summitward, Even as I said. From yonder vale we reach, By just these devious clamberings, we two, The vile Thing's lair. So shall we steal upon It, swords alert, Ere It hath time to turn Its greedy gaze From the broad popular stream-rimmed street. Nay, boy, thy courage? Hast thou moulted it Like a sick eagle his feathers? Come!â âLook, Ådipus!â Yards down, through prongs of cliff, Lysander's cry shot shuddering. âBy this dread signal, rolled from yonder steeps, We are warned! The fates rule unpropitiable! Fare back, dear friend, Fare back, though all Thebes hiss thy baffled vaunt! Fare back, I adjure thee!â Pity and scorn laughed Ådipus, and now Impetuously upsprang. Cloakless his breast and shoulders braved the breeze With symmetries august As those the great Greek sculptors give their gods; With feet a goat's for surety, and his eyes Radiant rebellions. The strait ravine veered narrowing till it coiled A stair whose rough sides pricked his restless arms. Then sudden, as though your step Should crush dry reeds, the youth trod snarls of bones In hideous lacework; some gnawed nude, And others bloody and ragged, as from wrench Of ravelling teeth. He paused, An instant numbed by nausea; then Dashed on and up, imperious, terrible. At last the ascent ceased, and a flat space gleamed, Ranged round with splints of rock, and foully paved With pallors and raw reds of carnage. Here Lodged the unutterable Thing. Here, hereâbut where? Beyond him, drowsed With marble might of tower and temple Thebes; But ere one reached it, one must thread The people's wayâwide-winding cityward Between two bright streams, Dirce and Ismenus, For months by this live Horror sentinelled. Here, there, the youth gazed searchingâ Stony yellow, and stony brown, And stony white on every side of him! No hint of life, all immobilityâAh! Yonder a movement! Yellow and brown and white, Like Its encompassings, a Shape sprawled huge. He dashed to assault It; but his two-edged sword Grew instantaneously void air, While the Shape turned and looked on him. A lion, a bird, yet human! Ådipus Felt first the intense monstrosity Of wings half sheathed, of leonine body. Then A woman's breast, a woman's face Dizzied him with wild wonder. Centuries Of effort to attain the beautiful Seemed in that breast and visage concentrate. Massive were both, yet rich with delicacies; The neck, throat, bust, one lily of regal grace; The lips, a flowering passion; brow, cheek, chin, Melodiously attuned and intertwined, As if their curves were rhythms of some high strain Inaudible here, and heard alone in realms Where gods commingle; and the eyes, For pupil and orbit grand, Emeralds of drowsy mystery, drowsy fire, Twilights of eves or dawns, howbeit the soul Might will to interpret them; twin deeps, Fathomless and crepuscular. Rallying from shock, spake Ådipus: âThou art That pest who fain would desolate fair Thebes. Thou art goddess, too; else my stout sword Had not so vanished from this grasp whose aim Was thy destruction.â Loiteringly the Sphinx: âI am goddess. Why Hast thou adventured thus By sidelong stealth upon my vantageâthou, A mortal? Didst thou dream By trickeries to o'erthrow me? Look On these crude records of audacity Less rash than thine.â âI have looked,â he hurled, still obdurate Though awed. âI have known, besides, The abomination of thy questionings To all who pass thee. Nay, if such thy power, Kill me, as thou hast melted into naught The sword I had meant to plunge in thy dark heart. Yet, ere thy Riddle is asked, Thy Riddle it bodes quick death To fail of answering, tell me what thou art, And wherefore, and how long thy beauty of beast, Blent with thy beauty of woman, shall inflict Bane upon Thebes.â âI tell thee nothing. Guess my Riddle or die.â With fierceness of the tiger and wolf in one, He darted toward her. âGive thy Riddle, O fiend, And may the gods befriend me!â âFatuous boy,â she laughed, In calm of supercilious indolence, âGuess this.â And then with tones of gold, Languid, yet savouring of harsh cruelty, She further spake. What fell from her was not The old legendary enigma, catchword snare, That children learn to-day, but weightfuller With many a pregnant meaning. Time Was in it, and eternity, and the flux Or reflux of man's destiny; the laws Of love, hate, honour, duty, obedience; Of art, song, music, and the idealisms That haunt us with such tender tyrannies; The starry and silver cobweb spun by space; The whither, whence, beginning, end of all We have named Divinity, glimpsed vague through life. And ever amid this awful monologue, A note of query implacably would ring, Until at last the tones of gold grew hoarse: âYou hear my Riddle. Unweave it me, or die.â A trance had fallen on Ådipus. He stood Statuesquely motionless and calm, While some power made of him an oracle, Delivering from unconscious lips Largess of truth and wisdom. Then he waked, As from a dream sublime, with echo and throb Of thoughts miraculous in brain and blood. But violently the Sphinx Had risen erect. Against her lion flanks Lashed the sleek lion tail; her claws distent Rasped the tough rock; strange pulses woke In her chimÃ¦ric wings. Yet boundless burned The tragedy of anguish on her face. âThine is the victory. Take it, Ådipus! I had feared this, dubiously, yet feared it. Now The death dealt many another swings Back with annihilation upon myself. But thou, my conqueror, be thou merciful! Think not of me hereafter in hard scorn, As glacial intellect with animalism Conjoined, an individuality Spurred by its own will to its own crime. Nay, I was but the incarnate Prophecy Of what the People in future years will prove, Half bestial and half spiritual. I flaunt My Riddle, as they will flaunt their own. Time thus doth pre-delineate their wild need, And they will punish, even as I have done, Thousands incapable of answering it. But thou art emblem of the omnipotence Which Knowledge, luminous guide and guard and god Of man, will somehow, sometime, somewhere, pour Torrentially, beneficently down Upon his darkness and his ignorance. For all is Knowledge; even the loftiest Love Is parcel of it. We are but images And symbols. In rehearsal weird Thou hast slain me, Superstition. Thou, Science, assaulter of the Unknowable Until it yields its ultimate secret, thou Must suffer, and with exorbitance of pain, This being the doom of all who fight to tear From nature, deity, what thou wilt, its mask Of incommunicable reserveâ O Ådipus, farewell! yet thou shalt fare, I fear me, not so calmly as I, whom now Morningless night enshrouds. We are shadows both, Flung on the eternal by the temporal, And both in shadow at last one shadowland Obliviously shall sepulchre. Farewell!â âStay, stay!â cried Ådipus, âI am fain To question of thee ...â But, with drearier cry The Sphinx, her vast vans opening, upward soared. One moment lofty in air she hung, Without a quiver of plumage hung serene, As though in fixity perpetual; then, With speed to have shamed the eye's alertest wink, Whirled herself to the chaos whence she had come. ANNORUM RECENTIORUM THE PHILIPPINE PURCHASE We that believed thee and loved thee, despite multitudinous errors, Can we forgive, O Republic, thy deep degradation to-day? Thou that hast boasted of freedom from talons of tyranny wrested, Thou to turn tyrant thyself, and their freedom from others despoil! Thus canst thou mock thine own valour, and all the chill hand-clasps of anguish There in that blaze of rebellion whence England recoiled with fatigue? Was it for this that thy loathing the rancours of slavery slaughtered? Thus canst thou waste thine Antietam? Thy Gettysburg squander disfamed? Once through the harp of thine honour great winds of democracy wandered, Straining to thunders aeolian the strength of its eloquent strings. Why unto earth hast thou flung it and shattered the might of its music? Why from the oak of its framework hast lighted the bonfires of greed? Spirits of Washington, Lincoln, and throngs of thy patriot helpers, Quicken their dust at thine outrage and scan thee with spectral rebuke; Faithless Republic, thou quenchest the stars that have burned on thy banners, Leaving the stripes but as emblems of scorn that thy body should bear! Thou that for safeguard and shelter from stains of monarchial stigmas Fledst where new skies might envault thee, new breezes pour balm on thy breast, Thou to dare envy the ravage of empire that once thou contemnedst, Craving with terrible famine thine own Finlands, Polands, and Cretes! Thou that hast loomed for thy lovers in wisdom's large warless aloofness, Thou that wert so statuesquely the world's one republic erewhile, Thou to stretch arms across ocean, where far-away Philippines cluster, Babbling the shibboleths ancient of âdestiny,â âprogressâ and âtradeâ! Name it by what name thou choosestâprotectiveness, guidance, or pity, Suzerainty's resolute vigil, fraternity's bountiful aid; Lust for the lucre of conquest and arrogance trampling the vanquishedâ These are the names that thy barter should glare with while truth remains truth. Ah, the old storyâwe know it! From king-beguiled priest-ridden Europe, On through the ages it echoes: the weak overswept by the strongâ Vultures of plunder and cunning, in âcivilisation'sâ false plumage, Fierce for the signs to dismantle its flesh from slain liberty's bones! 1901. THE ENIGMA Sweeps of mellowing prairie, soaked with suns and rains; Breadths of patriarch forest never an axeblow stains; Wreaths of radiant rivers, marged with fecund soil; Miles of houseless farmland, hungering for man's toil; Troops of sovereign mountains, rich with precious ore; Droves of game that scamper, flocks that float or soar; Nature's hand so bounteous!âYet (whate'er it means!) Twenty million dollars, twenty million dollars, twenty million dollars For the Philippines! Factories crammed with craftsfolk, deft at spools and looms; Mines where grisly thousands delve in sullen glooms; Fields where stalwart scythemen crop the lissome wheat; Seas where tawny fishers urge the fruitful fleet; Bred and reared and slaughtered, swarms of swine and kine; Orchards orbed with apples, grapes that whelm their vine; Largess poured from Labour!âYet (whate'er it means!) Twenty million dollars, twenty million dollars, twenty million dollars For the Philippines! In the mightiest city that our New World rears Bribery stalking lawless, justice choked with jeers; Washingtonian Senates fouled by guileful tricks; Halls of court and council smeared with politics; Money and honour fightingâstrong that fights with frail; Patriotism at auction, statesmanship for sale; Civic avarice rampantâYet (whate'er it means!) Twenty million dollars, twenty million dollars, twenty million dollars For the Philippines! School, asylum and sick-house yet forlornly few; Mercy in anguish pleading for the dole her due; Throngs of ragged children lean from famine's irk; Many a sturdy workman craving honest work; Widow and orphan helpless, age from comfort shorn; Dark disease rank-flowering where in filth 'twas born; Plenty and want still battlersâYet (whate'er it means!) Twenty million dollars, twenty million dollars, twenty million dollars For the Philippines! AMERICAN IMPERIALISM Avert, my country, from thine ear the voice That urges empire as thy chance or choice. Shame on the demagogues who plan thy doom Till foul with sophistries their senates fume. No sibyl yet among thy natal stars Hath leagued thy destiny with kings and czars. What boon or bourne could flattering conquest pledge Thee whose enormity two oceans edge? Nay, when at last, war's hells of gloom withdrawn, White peace brings daybreak whiter than earth's dawn, Set Cuba free, if such thy civic mood, Yet claim no tribute save her gratitude. Quit Asian waves; let Europe's prides and spleens Bicker like minnows round the Philippines. Tell Spain what heartless tactics thy soul shuns Of Alexanders and Napoleons; Reveal to her there is one land this hour Lured by no lust of territorial power; Teach her thy troops (though churlish be her thanks) Have drummed old veteran Greed from out their ranks. Flaunt not, Republic, from thy victory won Coarse triumphs to the unsympathetic sun. Hermit of nations let them call thee still; Hermits at least for bloodshed have no will. Agrarianism in menace let them cite; Vast houseless plains thy tillage yet invite. For lordlier commerce let them prate and pleadâ Meaning monopoly's brute maw to feed. ... Dear land, whose promises were half divine, Shalt thou to deeps of sordidness decline? About the calms and grandeurs of thy shape Tradition's purples deign once more to drape. Vulgar imperialism should vainly thrall Thee whose ideals were so imperial. The gladdest pÃ¦an of battle, thou shalt own, Has merely for its echo an orphan's moan; Though mightful be the warrior's pluck or grit, The widow's heartbreak may outmeasure it. A thousand slaughterous fields thou shouldst command Hereafter, but with unensanguined hand; A thousand batteries where the foe fights hard Thy cannonades of wisdom should bombard. And when to science and intellect low bow The last of all the inimic legions, thou Monarchical for motherhood mayst be, Gathering thy children round thy mighty knee. How falls it, O my country, that the schemes Of avarice tempt with these ignoble dreams? Would that my verse, in hatred of such wrong, Might flash from every line a sword of song! Would that my words, this madness to arraign, Were squadrons and battalions of disdain! Would that my grief might drown, for untold years, This rash fatuity with tides of tears! Yet few the bards from whose firm lips are borne Miltonic thunder, Juvenalian scorn; And in thy peril fate allots my strain Only the weak prerogative of pain. ... Yet still this unction to unrest I layâ The shadow hath stolen, but it will not stay. For now, even now, while doubt and dread are sore, I hear strange melodies wax more and more, That bode through all my spirit's listening scope Tempestuous music from the harp of hope! July 1898. THE SULTAN'S JUBILEE Strange are these plaudits thy foul reign begets, When fitlier all Gehenna might discuss With glee demoniac thine iniquitous Annals of agonies and bloody sweats. Insurgently the soul of progress frets To mark eulogium's blasphemy deck thus Thy City of Shame, where the blue Bosphorus Reduplicates her domes and minarets. Murder and slavery at thy jubilee Shall riot unseenâthe assassinated shapes Of many a martyr wail unheard their woes! And when thy revel is done, Polygamy Shall guide thee at dawn, gross Abdul, where sin drapes With poisonous purples thy seraglios! TO NIKOLA TESLA If power and confidence were wed as one In thy bold search o'er that far heavenward track, Renown as dominant thou shouldst not lack As all that fable on her dim loom hath spun. Thou shouldst be held in high communion With him Caucasian agonies did wrack; With Atlas, pondering Earth on his huge back; Or even Apollo, charioting the sun. Yet ah, too venturous, though man's toil may wrest Rich ores and gems from his dull globe's domain And bid their smothered light subservient shine, What mortal here, when spiritual his quest, Hath pick or spade that shall not quarry in vain Those blue vaults of Eternity's vast mine? LINCOLN LOQUITUR I Sternly the spirit of Lincoln speaks from the vague inane: âHear me and heed, O my children, me for the love of you slain! Whence is the wild war-madness, thralling your brains and souls? Where have your footsteps wandered, scornful of wisdom's goals? Was it for this that my starlight glittered while hurricanes raved? Was it for this that I served you? Was it for this that I saved? How should your impulse and purport lapse to such paltrier gain? Hear me and heed, O my children, me for the love of you slain! II âWhen amid frenzies of faction shuddered and shouted our land, Slavery's curse from its annals tore I with terrible hand. Postured sublimely unselfish, earth should envisage at last You, the one perfect Republic, found after venturings vast. Closer I burned to rebuild youâpediment, girder, and copeâ Fervid with dreams of your future, high as my haughtiest hope. Such was your prophesied splendour. ... Weak does it falter and wane? Hear me and heed, O my children, me for the love of you slain! III âWhat of the bondsmen I rescued? Can ye so lightly forget Wrong that of old was their durance, wrong that to-day is your debt? These from the blight of their bondage have ye upraised so supreme That in remote isles of ocean others ye fain would redeem? Yonder, unbarred from debasement, scourged by the lashes of caste, Look to your true âFilipinos,â heirs of an infamous past! Let not your lips laud as martyr him whom your actions profane; Hear me and heed, O my children, me for the love of you slain!â September 1899. INGERSOLL DEAD What ails the blue of day, the mirth of birds, The pomps of dawn and evening, the high calms Of night's miraculous gardens flowered with stars? Why sobs the ocean sadlier, and why laugh Less jocundly its bright innumerous lips? What spell hath stolen the emerald from the turf, And made the majesty of mountains loom Lowlier? It is the loss that sears our souls; It is not nature sorrowing; it is we! Nature, in mindless mechanism superb, Neither laments nor yet doth she rejoice. Nay, she but takes the tints, chameleon-wise, Of our own agony, while we stretch void arms For him that yesterday sublimely was! August 1899. THE AMERICAN ELECTIONS November 8, 1898 Sweet urn of poesy by Petrarca wrought, The lily or rose of his rare love to rear, Presumptuous do I choose thy sculptures clear To shrine this gaudier passion-flower of thought. Still, though in petal and calix it is fraught With fire whose vehemence might scorch and sear, Even hate hath moods when she is love's compeer, When sorrow an equal task to both has taught. Nay, wert thou not, my country, dear through dower Of acts that diamond from thine annals glow, To applaud or to upbraid thee were as one. But now? Ah, shame for lust of needless power, Shame for gross treachery to a fallen foe, Shame for this rank jeer at thy Washington! PRIDE OF NATIONS Pride of nations, work your will While its powers are in their prime, Hedge it round with tact and skill, Paint it fair in prose and rhyme; Tinge it gaudier than the slime That red battlefields distil; Stain it with the gold you spill Brighter than the daffodil; Work your will; yetâWar is crime. Pride of nations, work your will; Bid its fiery meanings chime With an epic charm sublimeâ Teach your eloquence to thrill Gathered throngs in many a clime; Wrest from words, âThou shalt not kill,â Their appropriate sense, until Conscience, grown a dexterous mime, Raiments good in robes of illâ Work your will; yetâWar is crime. Pride of nations, work your willâ Cleanliness was never grime; Chaste the woodland's crystal rill; Gross the swine and rank the swill; Pure the pasture's clustering thyme; Foul the swamp and fresh the hillâ Pride of nations, work your will; Save all heaven's fleet stars grow still, One stern truth shall bide through time: War is crime. TO ZOLA IN EXILE Weaver of tales that thrill the world With fearless fact in art's rare guise, What wonder your disdain is hurled On treason's labyrinth of lies? Nay, from your own proud fame you tore The safe insignia of its pride, And chose the brand your country bore In patriot passion to deride. All wars you loathe, but chiefly these Where scorpion guile would sting and fell; And when your pitying spirit sees Poor Dreyfus in his island hell, Old memories haunt you, crimson-streaked With brute mediÃ¦val brawls of class, With martyrdoms insanely wreaked On Ghetto and on Judenstrasse. âGive this man liberty,â you cry, âReft of its boon by rogue and cheat,â While starlike burns your poignant eye Through fogs of forgery and deceit. But ah, too idly falls your breath (With mercy, entreaty, wisdom rife) On souls for whom steel, blood and death Are creeds and litanies of life. Zola, the France wherewith you wrest Adores to-day at hate's black shrine; Sedan still rankles in her breast, She drinks revenge's dizzying wine. Vainly doth Justice rear the scales Your grand zeal strives to poise aright. Alas, the heavier sword prevails; The honour of your land weighs light! Still, bide your time, with droopless brow; In pain and exile, bide your time; ... This France you love hath known ere now Repentances that were sublime. Truth groans already in its drugged sleep; Your haughtiest foes fate snares and slaves; The mirk and mire they dig so deep Are their own ignominious graves! September 1898. AFRICA AD EUROPAM Here for milleniads my immensity Hath cloven the waters of the world and stretched South from that sea of story and song to where Welter, like thresholds of the infinite, Surges that break upon the Antarctic Pole. Ere through the granite of my loins had thronged Sphinxes and obelisks that once were Thebes, Were Karnak, I was old in memories. The Pyramids are but my yesterdays; The Ptolemies that many an age have lain Shrivelling among their spice and linens, count Only as upstarts from the soil I clasp. And yet thou, Europe, wouldst invade me thus, Thou that from Norway sheer to Greece my realm Could compass, while it spared for surplusage A continent Australia ill might match! Why hast thou left me not, O Malcontent, Sovereign of this my heritage from time? Barbarian though I be, barbarianism Is part and parcel of me, my nature's growth, Heightening toward phases that the future stores In mystery. Not by hest and hurry of thine Should bud to flower be forced, or flower to fruit. Nay, long I have watched thee from afar, with stare Of wonderment, thou Europe, whose past swarms One rhythm of vermin! Thou, whose tyranny Of avarice, pride, voluptuousness, deceit I have gazed on with abhorrence, thou to uplift My savages, who hast thyself scarce found Humanitarianism's mere fundaments! Look to thine England, soaked in pauperdom; Look to thy France, democracy's burlesque; Look to thy Germany, a swagger of swords; Look to thine Austria, torn with feuds and spites; Thine Italy, a braggadocio armed; Thy Spain, a corpse on horseback, like her Cid! Thou thus to have lessoned me, thou riot of spleens, Wrangling since Attila! Why hast thou dared Pour this the mockery of thy tutelage Among my lions and serpents and gazelles, My deserts where thy London were a speck, My forests that in gloom could sepulchre Scores of thy Parises, my leagues of lakes, My majesties of mountains, my repose Of pampa or swamp, whose flat rims cleave the flames Dawn lights or sunset lulls, my glory and grace Of rivers, and my cataractsâaltars raised Heavenward in scintillance, with haze of pearl For incense? Fain my Genius would attend Undesecrate the centuries' doles of doom, Here girt with swarthy myriads, men like thine. Fain unmolestedly would I live out The individuality of my lot. Thou hast achieved thy destiny. For me It flares all folly and failure. I mine own Would solve unmarred. Back, tamperer, to thy brawls! THE BATTLE SONG OF PEACE I saw, in a dream of the years to be, how Peace, with her gaze aglow, Shall throne herself on a throne too firm for earthquakes to overthrow. I heard how the chords of her great gold harp shall wait on her white hand's flash, With music now like the break of a brook and now like the whirlwind's crash. Then her voice, in my vision, skyward soared, with sublimity of release, And she sang me her song that the world awaits. 'Twas the Battle Song of Peace. âDay had come. Fate spoke. No tarriance, now; no manÅuvre of shift and screen; Only two vast armies face to face, with a vast bare plain between. âEre the reddening east from startled stars their last vague silver stole, I unsheathed my sword, bade our clarions play and our drums defiance roll. âAt the enemy's lines full speed we plunged; they marked us, intent to spring; And then, while the lurid sun lurched up, did our battle reel and ring. âMy troops of Charity massed their might as the great gales mass the tide, And shoulder to shoulder poured hot shot on the ranks of Civic Pride. âWith homespun serge o'er their stout young hearts, my hordes of Humanity dashed At the dainty and picked-out clans of Caste, white-gauntleted, silken-sashed. âSharpshooters all were the soldieries of Ambition, Hate and Greed; They sidled rearward, they slipped like snakes, while scattering deadly seed. âBut the Warriors Born were bolder far; they pushed us with haughty stress, Till shelled by our batteries on the heights, from Fort Loving-Kindliness. âTo Order and Wisdom and Law, staunch Aides, I would murmur my brief commands, And lightning-like would they leap to obey through our smoke-entangled bands. âThe Makers of Money from Politics were a cohort fierce and foul, But our Makers of Money from Honest Toil held chat with them, cheek by jowl. âThe Cut-Throats Commercial were firm at first, but we routed them till they ran, With our big battalions of Peace on Earth, our brigades âGood Will to Man.â âThen at last from a woodside's muffling boughs, on their steeds that reared and neighed, The Scorners of Arbitration rushed, an imperious cavalcade. ââHave at them!â I heard old Justice cry, through the fitful dins and flares, And his horsemen, bannered âThou Shalt not Kill,â came thundering thick on theirs. âAll the air clashed, roared; it was wrath against wrath, it was frenzy with frenzy at bay; They were fighting to keep the whole world in their clutch; we were fighting to tear it away. âIn our strength we trusted, yet dared not exult, for we knew them a host grim, strong; And we knew that though ours was the right, still the right had too oft been crushed by the wrong. âSo the turmoils of onslaught grew terribler yet, while from zenith to verge day passed, And I wondered its globe did not pause for sheer awe, and like Joshua's watch us aghast. âBut by eve strife ended; the conquest was ours; all opponents that yet lived had fled. ... As I leaned on my sword in the dimness I heard many voices that called âWar is Dead.â âThen they brought me to where archangelic he lay, on a sweep of the blood-soaked sod, With the hilt of a shattered blade in his hand, with the brows and brawn of a god. âAnd I stooped, stung by pity, beside his grand form, while the zephyrs of twilight veered south, And I that am woman, I, Peace, laid my lips on his cruel and beautiful mouth. âAnd I said: âThrow about him the purples of pomp: let his tomb like a king's be built; Let the fame of his courage be legended clear, but forbear to emblazon his guilt.â âNay, to them that grouped round me with marvelling looks, from the deeps of my pity I said: âThough alive I have loathed him through thousands of years, thus I pardon him now, being dead!ââ THE YELLOW DANGER O Europe, that so long hath spent thy spleen In tough trans-barrier battlings, till no peace Has thriven secure, from Denmark sheer to Greece, Past all thy heavens of hills and grandeurs green, Beware this menace, dire and unforeseen, That big with rally of onslaught, ere it cease, Calamitous through thy lands, at fate's caprice, Mongolian millions wildly would convene! Half yours the blame, Britannia, and half yours, Omnivorous Russia, since your greeds dared wake These torpid swarms to furious flame of ill! Yet shun Japan's conciliatory lures, Lest she, the old kith of China, turn and make This loathsome Yellow Danger yellower still! July 1900. SOCIALISM Mould me a thousand men who shall together bide Harmoniously for ten staunch years, whate'er betide. Let them to love's large creed secure obedience bring; From envy and malice freed, from egotism's cold sting, Let them to avarice, pride and fraud unwavering challenge fling. Let them, in reverent mood, each for the other toil, One mutual gain of good their victory and their spoil. With neither plaint nor pause, though strenuous tasks dismay, To self-surrendering laws let them allegiance pay; Let them break bread with life the ideal fraternal way. When these ten crucial years have proved these thousand men Impervious to all jeers of sarcasm's tongue or pen,â Have watched them struggle uncowed for honour's height and might,â Let faith's glad lips cry loud, âI have seen, with raptured sight, Sepulchral darkness flower at last in pure prophetic light!â Yet while the unravelled skein of human wrong persists, Even such weak test were vain, precipitate Socialists! The goals your gaze descries prodigious barriers block; Till your Utopias rise, great throes our world shall shock. The hours are centuries long on hope's millennial clock. THE CZAR'S MESSAGE Wake from a thousand thunderbolts one crash Win from a thousand lightning-strokes one flash Revive, in ravages of blasts and rains, The uproar of a century's hurricanes; Let earthquake, locked by slumber from alarms, Yawn yet again with subterranean arms; Bid pest and famine riot anew; make all A single concentrated blow to appal Our world;âand still such magnitude of might Were weak beside the amazement, the affright, The opprobrium, eulogy, disdain or joy Wrought in an hour by this Imperial Boy. From lands that despotism and slavery sear, What means his heavenly heart-cry, pealing clear? Aghast we marvel at the work so grand That fate's miraculous mystery hath planned. Though oft her whims be wayward, sharp her shocks, Why daze us with such dizzying paradox? ... Is this the Russia that we knew erewhile, Knouts in her frown and sabres in her smile? Whose ruffian dynasty of sovereigns rose Crime-crowned and ermined by Siberian snows? Whose thrones were scaffolds, and who shaped her laws Taloned with terror, like her bear's black paws? In galleries of whose palaces would lurk Assassination with its butchering dirk? The rubies of whose Urals were not more Than blood-drops on her torture-chamber's floor? Whose halls of justice were a dungeon's hells, Whose juries were its Moujik sentinels? Whose Alexanders, Katharines, Pauls, IvÃ ns Gave every sin full freedom, yet slew man's? Ah, never yet, sage history, hast thou known Figs thus from thorns or grapes from thistles grown! In vain, philosophy, shall thy best lore This radiant inconsistency explore! Yet even as through a swamp's dark reek of mire Some lily of taintless petal may aspire, So climbs through tyranny's gross mirk and bane The power and splendour of a soul humane. At last we read on destiny's dim scroll What empire may an emperor control, And thrilled through earth's five continents we see An autocrat's divine autocracy. Heed it or scorn, ye kings whose prides and fears With death have barricaded your frontiers; Heed it or scorn, abuzz like broods of gnats, Ye deft and oleaginous diplomats; Heed it or scorn, ye money-gorging mess, Who coin from slaughter your percentages; Heed it or scorn, ye politicians wise, Who garb self-worship in a patriot's guise; Heed it or scorn, ye concourse near and far, Who feast like vultures on the woes of war, And quaff with thirst unsated from their flood Inebriant vintages of tears and blood! Heed it or scorn. ... Howe'er with subtlest mien Procrastination on her crutch may lean; Howe'er expediency, like some coy lass, May attitudinise before her glass; Howe'er sly sophistry, with leer of ice, Clicks or manipulates his loaded dice; Howe'er all hindrance, massed and interblent, Grow mountainous in its impediment, Still shall this Message, rich with sacred cheers, Lend ardour to the iconoclastic years, And bid them, at some future hour's glad reign, Cleanse from all nations' brows the Brand of Cain. Oct. 4, 1898. ANARCHY Out of your own black records, reeking with shame and sham, Ye have wrought me, O nations of Europe, the leprous thing that I am. Aloof in humanity's twilight, where kings and gods were as one, I was born like the swine that wallow, like the moles that slink from sun. Raw feudalism begot me, with shuddering fear for mate; I was rocked in my cradle by squalor and my swaddling-gear was hate. Through the dark mediÃ¦val decades, forgot amid mirk and ruck, An infant, a giant, a monster, despair from its dugs gave me suck. I was earthy and yet was I spirit, demoniac and yet was I meek, While the vulture of degradation in my vitals would plunge its beak. Even thus lying helpless, I waited, alone with my fiery tears, Unaware how I won slow vigour from the stealthy and strengthening years. Yet the pageants of history passed me as I writhed in my lair of mud, All their purples of arrogance flaunted, and their crimsons ablaze with blood. I beheld how the backs of the people were branded with scar upon scar From the curses of caste, from the curses of greed, from the curses of war. And at last I arose, I exulted, with my hardihood fostered of time, An Anguish by anguish made potent, a Crime procreated by crime. If ye ask me my purport what boots it your heed on my answer to hang? Do they question the cobra where found he the venom that leaps from his fang? Can ye tear the foul fume from corruption, or cleanse from dishonour the stain? To a tiger your logic is lifeless, to a viper your maxims are vain. When ye slay in your own souls their evil, my infamies then shall ye slay; I am sin that man sinned through the ages; I am sin that he still sins to-day. And like dews below noons I shall perish, when shall perish from lands that they mar The curses of caste and the curses of greed and the curses of war. And while these are yet regnant and rampant, in my veins their vile spell shall not die; Nay, while these o'er the world loom colossal, the shadow of them shall be I! October 20, 1898. THE FORBIDDEN CITY Not holy of holies were your sitting nameâ Profanest of profanities were best, O lair whence long toward heaven hath reeked the pest Of crime concentrate, of sequestered shame! But now spoliation pours its tardy flame On garden, temple and throne with equal zest; Violation poniards now through each rash breast The inviolabilities you dare to claim. So, City of Arrogance, your vauntful sway Hath vanished from below the insulted sky That long too leniently endured its den. And lo, you have learned at last in what sure way Nations that scorn their fellow-nations die, Cursed like the men who scorn their fellow-men. 1900. PEACE INDIGNANT I weary of all this moving to and fro, This welcome and exile, thraldom and release. To-day I am throned a queen; to-morrow, lo, My dignities lie whelmed in overthrowâ From sovereignty my crown and sceptre cease. Shame, bitter shame, ye people of ampler mind, My shivering spirit now to wrench and rack, As once, in thought's dim twilight, centuries back, While plaintless to barbarianism resigned, I bore your ribaldries demoniac. Hope dawned for me when Egypt, India, Greece Flowered out from brutish darkness, and when Rome At her wise councils gave me help and homeâ Nay, built me as Divinity of Peace Temples with pillared porch and stainless dome. Yet ah, she worshipped me in nameâno more! Her smoking tripods were the flare of fools, Her homage was the speech an idiot drules; She blotched my robes with desecrating gore, With battle invaded my pure vestibules. At last in its immensity Rome fell, Scourged of the Christ whose lash was love alone. ... I reared my head, bound firmer my gold zone, And murmuring to my glad heart âAll is well,â Dreamed that war's foul vans were for ever flown. Mockery of promise! I have proved, since then, With pain whose ache dealt many a throb and pang, Those perfidies whence my delusion sprang; I have learned how âpeace on earth, good will to menâ With but the hypocrisy of braggarts rang. What wonder that from these tumultuous veins Meekness and tolerance alike ye scare, O giddy and greedy nations that still dare To insult your Prince of Peace, through all his fanes, With sarcasms and with blasphemies of prayer? Nay, mother and wife and daughter, how shall fail Your agony while hideous hates intrigue To fire it, and so fiercely against it league? ... For me, my pity and wrath and scorn prevail, Even though I falter with a god's fatigue. THE FALLEN CAMPANILE As one that draws the drapery from a face Where some great painter's power hath sought to crush The souls of lily and rose in one rare blush Of heavenly womanhood, I seem to trace Ethereal hands that tenderly displace Memory's dull veils, till o'er my spirit rush Tumultuous dreams of Venice, with her flush Of beauty and pomp, her grandeurs robed in grace. Folded for ever by the sweet caress Of arms that from the blue auxiliar sea Glide up to engird and clasp her as their own, O flower of cities, with pale palaces And glitter of waves for petals, can it be That time thy glorious crest hath overthrown? September 1902. THE NEGRO LYNCHINGS Blacker the crime, I grant, than his black skin, O ye who hale him to hot penances. And yet he is manâthough bestial, still is man, And law was made for man, however large May tower his turpitude. The strength and right Of Justice in her scales and bandaged eyes Hold sanctuary, and when from hand or brow Ye ravish these, the insignia of her rule, Forthwith ye have turned her fragile as a reed. Throne in her place Revenge, if so ye will, With torture for its minion. What avails? Lo, placid History plucks ye by the sleeve. ... Who is this monster that your blasts of wrath Buffet so furiously? Bid patience track With rearward look his paths of pedigree. In Africa, through shades of giant fern, To some near verge of ocean spired with palms, A youth strayed careless from his playfellows, When suddenly ambushed captors leapt on him, And felled his body, and leashed his limbs, and gagged His mouth, and rowed him where a bark hugged shoreâ That scorpion of the sea, their slave-ship! Here In filth and fetor many a night and day Of anguish did he toss, moan, supplicate. Then came release, though slavery brought its boon! And on through generations born of him Did slavery linger. Who but knows the tale? Whittier's melodious muse hath sung it us, The oratory of Summer phrased it us, The guns of Grant and Sherman roared it us, And yet with mightier meaning than all these, The martyrdom of Lincoln left it us! A zephyr, and not a whirlwind, shall we reap When once we have sown the wind? Who dares to dream That ignorance and abasement breed their kind Unsmirched? O ye that with the autocracy Of lawlessness would cloak yourselves, beware! Punishment shorn of justice rates ye all A bevy of mere assassins, who defame The freedom that your sires' blood-sacrifice Inviolable should keep. Ah, yes, we know Your grievance to its hideous depth and height. But these no longer are the days that robe Precipitate passion with spectacular Tinsels of dignity. Each thrust of blade, Each glittering fagot, each lewd jeer ye deal The swart bound wretch who shrieks his vile life mute, Infects your own souls with his bane of sin, Rebrutalises there the brute benumbed By civilisation, drags ye darkly back To savagery whence life hath striven to steer Your destinies, and swathes with ruffian fog The august gold orb of wisdom's pilot star. THE OLD CENTURY TO THE NEW While feebly at last in my great soul has burned That flame whose full resplendence did confer Far mightier meeds than thrones and miniver On generations that have here sojourned, Oh thou, toward whose bright face hope's tides are turned, I feel thy warm palm in this cold clasp stir,â Cold as the long walls of that sepulchre Where many a dead forefather lies inurned. Farewell! I have sought with majesty to bear My sceptre; shames and wrongs I have sought to kill; Knowledge to feed;âlend virtue hardier girth. Go, therefore, thou, mine offspring and mine heir; With boons and benedictions costlier still, Go grandly forth and greet the awaiting earth. December 1900.</field>
