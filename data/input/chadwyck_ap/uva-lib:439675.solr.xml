      <field name="fulltext">GLOUCESTER MOORS And Other Poems GLOUCESTER MOORS A mile behind is Gloucester town Where the fishing fleets put in, A mile ahead the land dips down And the woods and farms begin. Here, where the moors stretch free In the high blue afternoon, Are the marching sun and talking sea, And the racing winds that wheel and flee On the flying heels of June. Jill-o'er-the-ground is purple blue, Blue is the quaker-maid, The wild geranium holds its dew Long in the boulder's shade. Wax-red hangs the cup From the huckleberry boughs, In barberry bells the grey moths sup, Or where the choke-cherry lifts high up Sweet bowls for their carouse. Over the shelf of the sandy cove Beach-peas blossom late. By copse and cliff the swallows rove Each calling to his mate. Seaward the sea-gulls go, And the land-birds all are here; That green-gold flash was a vireo, And yonder flame where the marsh-flags grow Was a scarlet tanager. This earth is not the steadfast place We landsmen build upon; From deep to deep she varies pace, And while she comes is gone. Beneath my feet I feel Her smooth bulk heave and dip; With velvet plunge and soft upreel She swings and steadies to her keel Like a gallant, gallant ship. These summer clouds she sets for sail, The sun is her masthead light, She tows the moon like a pinnace frail Where her phosphor wake churns bright. Now hid, now looming clear, On the face of the dangerous blue The star fleets tack and wheel and veer, But on, but on does the old earth steer As if her port she knew. God, dear God! Does she know her port, Though she goes so far about? Or blind astray, does she make her sport To brazen and chance it out? I watched when her captains passed: She were better captainless. Men in the cabin, before the mast, But some were reckless and some aghast, And some sat gorged at mess. By her battened hatch I leaned and caught Sounds from the noisome hold,â Cursing and sighing of souls distraught And cries too sad to be told. Then I strove to go down and see; But they said, âThou art not of us!â I turned to those on the deck with me And cried, âGive help!â But they said, âLet be: Our ship sails faster thus.â Jill-o'er-the-ground is purple blue, Blue is the quaker-maid, The alder-clump where the brook comes through Breeds cresses in its shade. To be out of the moiling street With its swelter and its sin! Who has given to me this sweet, And given my brother dust to eat? And when will his wage come in? Scattering wide or blown in ranks, Yellow and white and brown, Boats and boats from the fishing banks Come home to Gloucester town. There is cash to purse and spend, There are wives to be embraced, Hearts to borrow and hearts to lend, And hearts to take and keep to the end,â O little sails, make haste! But thou, vast outbound ship of souls, What harbor town for thee? What shapes, when thy arriving tolls, Shall crowd the banks to see? Shall all the happy shipmates then Stand singing brotherly? Or shall a haggard ruthless few Warp her over and bring her to, While the many broken souls of men Fester down in the slaver's pen And nothing to say or do? GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT At last the bird that sang so long In twilight circles, hushed his song: Above the ancient square The stars came here and there. Good Friday night! Some hearts were bowed, But some amid the waiting crowd Because of too much youth Felt not that mystic ruth; And of these hearts my heart was one: Nor when beneath the arch of stone With dirge and candle flame The cross of passion came, Did my glad spirit feel reproof, Though on the awful tree aloof, Unspiritual, dead, Drooped the ensanguined Head. To one who stood where myrtles made A little space of deeper shade (As I could half descry, A stranger, even as I), I said, âThese youths who bear along The symbols of their Saviour's wrong, The spear, the garment torn, The flaggel, and the thorn,â âWhy do they make this mummery? Would not a brave man gladly die For a much smaller thing Than to be Christ and king?â He answered nothing, and I turned. Throned in its hundred candles burned The jeweled eidolon Of her who bore the Son. The crowd was prostrate; still, I felt. No shame until the stranger knelt; Then not to kneel, almost Seemed like a vulgar boast. I knelt. The doll-face, waxen white, Flowered out a living dimness; bright Dawned the dear mortal grace Of my own mother's face. When we were risen up, the street Was vacant; all the air hung sweet With lemon-flowers; and soon The sky would hold the moon. More silently than new-found friends To whom much silence makes amends For the much babble vain While yet their lives were twain, We walked along the odorous hill. The light was little yet; his will I could not see to trace Upon his form or face. So when aloft the gold moon broke, I cried, heart-stung. As one who woke He turned unto my cries The anguish of his eyes. âFriend! Master!â I cried falteringly, âThou seest the thing they make of thee. Oh, by the light divine My mother shares with thine, âI beg that I may lay my head Upon thy shoulder and be fed With thoughts of brotherhood!â So through the odorous wood, More silently than friends new-found We walked. At the first meadow bound His figure ashen-stoled Sank in the moon's broad gold. ROAD-HYMN FOR THE START Leave the early bells at chime, Leave the kindled hearth to blaze, Leave the trellised panes where children linger out the waking-time, Leave the forms of sons and fathers trudging through the misty ways, Leave the sounds of mothers taking up their sweet laborious days. Pass them by! even while our soul Yearns to them with keen distress. Unto them a part is given; we will strive to see the whole. Dear shall be the banquet table where their singing spirits press; Dearer be our sacred hunger, and our pilgrim loneliness. We have felt the ancient swaying Of the earth before the sun, On the darkened marge of midnight heard sidereal rivers playing; Rash it was to bathe our souls there, but we plunged and all was done. That is lives and lives behind usâlo, our journey is begun! Careless where our face is set, Let us take the open way. What we are no tongue has told us: Errand-goers who forget? Soldiers heedless of their harry? Pilgrim people gone astray? We have heard a voice cry âWander!â That was all we heard it say. Ask no more: 't is much, 't is much! Down the road the day-star calls; Touched with change in the wide heavens, like a leaf the frost winds touch, Flames the failing moon a moment, ere it shrivels white and falls; Hid aloft, a wild throat holdeth sweet and sweeter intervals. Leave him still to ease in song Half his little heart's unrest: Speech is his, but we may journey toward the life for which we long. God, who gives the bird its anguish, maketh nothing manifest, But upon our lifted foreheads pours the boon of endless quest. AN ODE IN TIME OF HESITATION (After seeing at Boston the statue of Robert Gould Shaw, killed while storming Fort Wagner, July 18, 1863, at the head of the first enlisted negro regiment, the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts.) I Before the solemn bronze Saint Gaudens made To thrill the heedless passer's heart with awe, And set here in the city's talk and trade To the good memory of Robert Shaw, This bright March morn I stand, And hear the distant spring come up the land; Knowing that what I hear is not unheard Of this boy soldier and his negro band, For all their gaze is fixed so stern ahead, For all the fatal rhythm of their tread. The land they died to save from death and shame Trembles and waits, hearing the spring's great name, And by her pangs these resolute ghosts are stirred. II Through street and mall the tides of people go Heedless; the trees upon the Common show No hint of green; but to my listening heart The still earth doth impart Assurance of her jubilant emprise, And it is clear to my long-searching eyes That love at last has might upon the skies. The ice is runneled on the little pond; A telltale patter drips from off the trees; The air is touched with southland spiceries, As if but yesterday it tossed the frond Of pendant mosses where the live-oaks grow Beyond Virginia and the Carolines, Or had its will among the fruits and vines Of aromatic isles asleep beyond Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. III Soon shall the Cape Ann children shout in glee, Spying the arbutus, spring's dear recluse; Hill lads at dawn shall hearken the wild goose Go honking northward over Tennessee; West from Oswego to Sault Sainte-Marie, And on to where the Pictured Rocks are hung, And yonder where, gigantic, wilful, young, Chicago sitteth at the northwest gates, With restless violent hands and casual tongue Moulding her mighty fates, The Lakes shall robe them in ethereal sheen; And like a larger sea, the vital green Of springing wheat shall vastly be outflung Over Dakota and the prairie states. By desert people immemorial On Arizonan mesas shall be done Dim rites unto the thunder and the sun; Nor shall the primal gods lack sacrifice More splendid, when the white Sierras call Unto the Rockies straightway to arise And dance before the unveiled ark of the year, Sounding their windy cedars as for shawms, Unrolling rivers clear For flutter of broad phylacteries; While Shasta signals to Alaskan seas That watch old sluggish glaciers downward creep To fling their icebergs thundering from the steep, And Mariposa through the purple calms Gazes at far Hawaii crowned with palms Where East and West are met,â A rich seal on the ocean's bosom set To say that East and West are twain, With different loss and gain: The Lord hath sundered them; let them be sundered yet. IV Alas! what sounds are these that come Sullenly over the Pacific seas,â Sounds of ignoble battle, striking dumb The season's half-awakened ecstasies? Must I be humble, then, Now when my heart hath need of pride? Wild love falls on me from these sculptured men; By loving much the land for which they died I would be justified. My spirit was away on pinions wide To soothe in praise of her its passionate mood And ease it of its ache of gratitude. Too sorely heavy is the debt they lay On me and the companions of my day. I would remember now My country's goodliness, make sweet her name. Alas! what shade art thou Of sorrow or of blame Liftest the lyric leafage from her brow, And pointest a slow finger at her shame? V Lies! lies! It cannot be! The wars we wage Are noble, and our battles still are won By justice for us, ere we lift the gage. We have not sold our loftiest heritage. The proud republic hath not stooped to cheat And scramble in the market-place of war; Her forehead weareth yet its solemn star. Here is her witness: this, her perfect son, This delicate and proud New England soul Who leads despisÃ¨d men, with just-unshackled feet, Up the large ways where death and glory meet, To show all peoples that our shame is done, That once more we are clean and spirit-whole. VI Crouched in the sea fog on the moaning sand All night he lay, speaking some simple word From hour to hour to the slow minds that heard, Holding each poor life gently in his hand And breathing on the base rejected clay Till each dark face shone mystical and grand Against the breaking day; And lo, the shard the potter cast away Was grown a fiery chalice crystal-fine Fulfilled of the divine Great wine of battle wrath by God's ring-finger stirred. Then upward, where the shadowy bastion loomed Huge on the mountain in the wet sea light, Whence now, and now, infernal flowerage bloomed, Bloomed, burst, and scattered down its deadly seed,â They swept, and died like freemen on the height, Like freemen, and like men of noble breed; And when the battle fell away at night By hasty and contemptuous hands were thrust Obscurely in a common grave with him The fair-haired keeper of their love and trust. Now limb doth mingle with dissolvÃ¨d limb In nature's busy old democracy To flush the mountain laurel when she blows Sweet by the southern sea, And heart with crumbled heart climbs in the rose:â The untaught hearts with the high heart that knew This mountain fortress for no earthly hold Of temporal quarrel, but the bastion old Of spiritual wrong, Built by an unjust nation sheer and strong, Expugnable but by a nation's rue And bowing down before that equal shrine By all men held divine, Whereof his band and he were the most holy sign. VII O bitter, bitter shade! Wilt thou not put the scorn And instant tragic question from thine eye? Do thy dark brows yet crave That swift and angry staveâ Unmeet for this desirous mornâ That I have striven, striven to evade? Gazing on him, must I not deem they err Whose careless lips in street and shop aver As common tidings, deeds to make his cheek Flush from the bronze, and his dead throat to speak? Surely some elder singer would arise, Whose harp hath leave to threaten and to mourn Above this people when they go astray. Is Whitman, the strong spirit, overworn? Has Whittier put his yearning wrath away? I will not and I dare not yet believe! Though furtively the sunlight seems to grieve, And the spring-laden breeze Out of the gladdening west is sinister With sounds of nameless battle overseas; Though when we turn and question in suspense If these things be indeed after these ways, And what things are to follow after these, Our fluent men of place and consequence Fumble and fill their mouths with hollow phrase, Or for the end-all of deep arguments Intone their dull commercial liturgiesâ I dare not yet believe! My ears are shut! I will not hear the thin satiric praise And muffled laughter of our enemies, Bidding us never sheathe our valiant sword Till we have changed our birthright for a gourd Of wild pulse stolen from a barbarian's hut; Showing how wise it is to cast away The symbols of our spiritual sway, That so our hands with better ease May wield the driver's whip and grasp the jailer's keys. VIII Was it for this our fathers kept the law? This crown shall crown their struggle and their ruth? Are we the eagle nation Milton saw Mewing its mighty youth, Soon to possess the mountain winds of truth, And be a swift familiar of the sun Where aye before God's face his trumpets run? Or have we but the talons and the maw, And for the abject likeness of our heart Shall some less lordly bird be set apart?â Some gross-billed wader where the swamps are fat? Some gorger in the sun? Some prowler with the bat? IX Ah no! We have not fallen so. We are our fathers' sons: let those who lead us know! 'T was only yesterday sick Cuba's cry Came up the tropic wind, âNow help us, for we die!â Then Alabama heard, And rising, pale, to Maine and Idaho Shouted a burning word. Proud state with proud impassioned state conferred, And at the lifting of a hand sprang forth, East, west, and south, and north, Beautiful armies. Oh, by the sweet blood and young Shed on the awful hill slope at San Juan, By the unforgotten names of eager boys Who might have tasted girls' love and been stung With the old mystic joys And starry griefs, now the spring nights come on, But that the heart of youth is generous,â We charge you, ye who lead us, Breathe on their chivalry no hint of stain! Turn not their new-world victories to gain! One least leaf plucked for chaffer from the bays Of their dear praise, One jot of their pure conquest put to hire, The implacable republic will require; With clamor, in the glare and gaze of noon, Or subtly, coming as a thief at night, But surely, very surely, slow or soon That insult deep we deeply will requite. Tempt not our weakness, our cupidity! For save we let the island men go free, Those baffled and dislaureled ghosts Will curse us from the lamentable coasts Where walk the frustrate dead. The cup of trembling shall be drainÃ¨d quite, Eaten the sour bread of astonishment, With ashes of the hearth shall be made white Our hair, and wailing shall be in the tent; Then on your guiltier head Shall our intolerable self-disdain Wreak suddenly its anger and its pain; For manifest in that disastrous light We shall discern the right And do it, tardily.âO ye who lead, Take heed! Blindness we may forgive, but baseness we will smite. 1900. THE QUARRY Between the rice swamps and the fields of tea I met a sacred elephant, snow-white. Upon his back a huge pagoda towered Full of brass gods and food of sacrifice. Upon his forehead sat a golden throne, The massy metal twisted into shapes Grotesque, antediluvian, such as move In myth or have their broken images Sealed in the stony middle of the hills. A peacock spread his thousand dyes to screen The yellow sunlight from the head of one Who sat upon the throne, clad stiff with gems, Heirlooms of dynasties of buried kings,â Himself the likeness of a buried king, With frozen gesture and unfocused eyes. The trappings of the beast were over-scrawled With broideriesâsea-shapes and flying things, Fan-trees and dwarfed nodosities of pine, Mixed with old alphabets, and faded lore Fallen from ecstatic mouths before the Flood, Or gathered by the daughters when they walked Eastward in Eden with the Sons of God Whom love and the deep moon made garrulous. Between the carven tusks his trunk hung dead; Blind as the eyes of pearl in Buddha's brow His beaded eyes stared thwart upon the road; And feebler than the doting knees of eld, His joints, of size to swing the builder's crane Across the war-walls of the Anakim, Made vain and shaken haste. Good need was his To hasten: panting, foaming, on the slot Came many brutes of prey, their several hates Laid by until the sharing of the spoil. Just as they gathered stomach for the leap, The sun was darkened, and wide-balanced wings Beat downward on the trade-wind from the sea. A wheel of shadow sped along the fields And o'er the dreaming cities. Suddenly My heart misgave me, and I cried aloud, âAlas! What dost thou here? What dost thou here?â The great beasts and the little halted sharp, Eyed the grand circler, doubting his intent. Straightway the wind flawed and he came about, Stooping to take the vanward of the pack; Then turned, between the chasers and the chased, Crying a word I could not understand,â But stiller-tongued, with eyes somewhat askance, They settled to the slot and disappeared. 1900. ON A SOLDIER FALLEN IN THE PHILIPPINES Streets of the roaring town, Hush for him, hush, be still! He comes, who was stricken down Doing the word of our will. Hush! Let him have his state, Give him his soldier's crown. The grists of trade can wait Their grinding at the mill, But he cannot wait for his honor, now the trumpet has been blown; Wreathe pride now for his granite brow, lay love on his breast of stone. Toll! Let the great bells toll Till the clashing air is dim. Did we wrong this parted soul? We will make up it to him. Toll! Let him never guess What work we set him to. Laurel, laurel, yes; He did what we bade him do. Praise, and never a whispered hint but the fight he fought was good; Never a word that the blood on his sword was his country's own heart's-blood. A flag for the soldier's bier Who dies that his land may live; O, banners, banners here, That he doubt not nor misgive! That he heed not from the tomb The evil days draw near When the nation, robed in gloom, With its faithless past shall strive. Let him never dream that his bullet's scream went wide of its island mark, Home to the heart of his darling land where she stumbled and sinned in the dark. UNTIL THE TROUBLING OF THE WATERS Two hours, two hours: God give me strength for it! He who has given so much strength to me And nothing to my child, must give to-day What more I need to try and save my child And get for him the life I owe to him. To think that I may get it for him now, Before he knows how much he might have missed That other boys have got! The bitterest thought Of all that plagued me when he came was this, How some day he would see the difference, And drag himself to me with puzzled eyes To ask me why it was. He would have been Cruel enough to do it, knowing not That was the question my rebellious heart Cried over and over one whole year to God, And got no answer and no help at all. If he had asked me, what could I have said? What single word could I have found to say To hide me from his searching, puzzled gaze? Some coward thing at best, never the truth; The truth I never could have told him. No, I never could have said, âGod gave you me To fashion you a body, right and strong, With sturdy little limbs and chest and neck For fun and fighting with your little mates, Great feats and voyages in the breathless world Of out-of-doors,âHe gave you me for this, And I was such a bungler, that is all!â O, the old lieâthat thought was not the worst. I never have been truthful with myself. For by the door where lurked one ghostly thought I stood with crazy hands to thrust it back If it should dare to peep and whisper out Unbearable things about me, hearing which The women passing in the streets would turn To pity me and scold me with their eyes, Who was so bad a mother and so slow To learn to help God do his wonder in her That sheâO my sweet baby! It was not The fear that you would see the difference Between you and the other boys and girls; No, no, it was the dimmer, wilder fear, That you might never see it, never look Out of your tiny baby-house of mind, But sit your life through, quiet in the dark, Smiling and nodding at what was not there! A foolish fear: God could not punish so. Yet until yesterday I thought He would. My soul was always cowering at the blow I saw suspended, ready to be dealt The moment that I showed my fear too much. Therefore I hid it from Him all I could, And only stole a shaking glance at it Sometimes in the dead minutes before dawn When He forgets to watch. Till yesterday. For yesterday was wonderful and strange From the beginning. When I wakened first And looked out at the window, the last snow Was gone from earth; about the apple-trees Hung a faint mist of bloom; small sudden green Had run and spread and rippled everywhere Over the fields; and in the level sun Walked something like a presence and a power, Uttering hopes and loving-kindnesses To all the world, but chiefly unto me. It walked before me when I went to work, And all day long the noises of the mill Were spun upon a core of golden sound, Half-spoken words and interrupted songs Of blessed promise, meant for all the world, But most for me, because I suffered most. The shooting spindles, the smooth-humming wheels, The rocking webs, seemed toiling to some end Beneficent and human known to them, And duly brought to pass in power and love. The faces of the girls and men at work Met mine with intense greeting, veiled at once As if they knew a secret they must keep For fear the joy would harm me if they told Before some inkling filtered to my mind In roundabout ways. When the day's work was done There lay a special silence on the fields; And, as I passed, the bushes and the trees, The very ruts and puddles of the road Spoke to each other, saying it was she, The happy woman, the elected one, The vessel of strange mercy and the sign Of many loving wonders done in Heaven To help the piteous earth. At last I stopped And looked about me in sheer wonderment. What did it mean? What did they want with me? What was the matter with the evening now That it was just as bound to make me glad As morning and the live-long day had been? Me, who had quite forgot what gladness was, Who had no right to anything but toil, And food and sleep for strength to toil again, And that fierce frightened anguish of my love For the poor little spirit I had wronged With life that was no life. What had befallen Since yesterday? No need to stop and ask! Back there in the dark places of my mind Where I had thrust it, fearing to believe An unbelievable mercy, shone the news Told by the village neighbors coming home Last night from the great city, of a man Arisen, like the first evangelists, With power to heal the bodies of the sick, In testimony of his master Christ, Who heals the soul when it is sick with sin. Could such a thing be true in these hard days? Was help still sent in such a way as that? No, no! I did not dare to think of it, Feeling what weakness and despair would come After the crazy hope broke under me. I turned and started homeward, faster now, But never fast enough to leave behind The voices and the troubled happiness That still kept mounting, mounting like a sea, And singing far-off like a rush of wings. Far down the road a yellow spot of light Shone from my cottage window, rayless yet, Where the last sunset crimson caught the panes. Alice had lit the lamp before she went; Her day of pity and unmirthful play Was over, and her young heart free to live Until to-morrow brought her nursing-task Again, and made her feel how dark and still That life could be to others which to her Was full of dreams that beckoned, reaching hands, And thrilling invitations young girls hear. My boy was sleeping, little mind and frame More tired just lying there awake two hours Than with a whole day's romp he should have been. He would not know his mother had come home; But after supper I would sit awhile Beside his bed, and let my heart have time For that worst love that stabs and breaks and kills. This I thought over to myself by rote And habit, but I could not feel my thoughts; For still that dim unmeaning happiness Kept mounting, mounting round me like a sea, And singing inward like a wind of wings. Before I lifted up the latch, I knew. I felt no fear; the One who waited there In the low lamplight by the bed, had come Because I was his sister and in need. My word had got to Him somehow at last, And He had come to help me or to tell Where help was to be found. It was not strange. Strange only He had stayed away so long; But that should be forgottenâHe was here. I pushed the door wide open and looked in. He had been kneeling by the bed, and now, Half-risen, kissed my boy upon the lips, Then turned and smiled and pointed with his hand. I must have fallen on the threshold stone, For I remember that I felt, not saw, The resurrection glory and the peace Shed from his face and raiment as He went Out by the door into the evening street. But when I looked, the place about the bed Was yet all bathed in light, and in the midst My boy lay changed,âno longer clothed upon With scraps and shreds of life, but like the child Of some most fortunate mother. In a breath The image faded. There he lay again The same as always; and the light was gone. I sank with moans and cries beside the bed. The cruelty, O Christ, the cruelty! To come at last and then to go like that, Leaving the darkness deeper than before! Then, though I heard no sound, I grew aware Of some one standing by the open door Among the dry vines rustling in the porch. My heart laughed suddenly. He had come back! He had come back to make the vision true. He had not meant to mock me: God was God, And Christ was Christ; there was no falsehood there. I heard a quiet footstep cross the room And felt a hand laid gently on my hair,â A human hand, worn hard by daily toil, Heavy with life-long struggle after bread. Alice's father. The kind homely voice Had in it such strange music that I dreamed Perhaps it was the Other speaking in him, Because his own bright form had made me swoon With its too much of glory. What he brought Was news as good as ever heavenly lips Had the dear right to utter. He had been All day among the crowds of curious folk From the great city and the country-side Gathered to watch the Healer do his work Of mercy on the sick and halt and blind, And with his very eyes had seen such things As awestruck men had witnessed long ago In Galilee, and writ of in the Book. To-morrow morning he would take me there If I had strength and courage to believe. It might be there was hope; he could not say, But knew what he had seen. When he was gone I lay for hours, letting the solemn waves Thundering joy go over and over me. Just before midnight baby fretted, woke; He never yet has slept a whole night through Without his food and petting. As I sat Feeding and petting him and singing soft, I felt a jealousy begin to ache And worry at my heartstrings, hushing down The gladness. Jealousy of what or whom? I hardly knew, or could not put in words; At least it seemed too foolish and too wrong When said, and so I shut the thought away. Only, next minute, it came stealing back. After the change, would my boy be the same As this one? Would he be my boy at all, And not another'sâhis who gave the life I could not give, or did not anyhow? How could I look in his new eyes to claim The whole of him, the body and the breath, When some one not his mother, a strange man, Had clothed him in that beauty of the fleshâ Perhaps (for who could know?), perhaps, by some Hateful disfiguring miracle, had even Transformed his sprit to a better one, Better, but not the same I prayed for him Down out of Heaven through the sleepless nights,â The best that God would send to such as me. I tried to strangle back the wicked pain; Fancied him changed and tried to love him so. No use; it was another, not my child, Not my frail, broken, priceless little one, My cup of anguish, and my trembling star Hung small and sad and sweet above the earth, So sure to fall but for my cherishing! When he had dropped asleep again, I rose And wrestled with the sinful selfishness, The dark injustice, the unnatural pain. Fevered at last with pacing to and fro, I raised the bedroom window and leaned out. The white moon, low behind the sycamores, Silvered the silent country; not a voice Of all the myriads summer moves to sing Had yet awakened; in the level moon Walked that same presence I had heard at dawn Uttering hopes and loving-kindnesses, But now, dispirited and reticent, It walked the moonlight like a homeless thing. O, how to cleanse me of the cowardice! How to be just! Was I a mother, then, A mother, and not love her child as well As her own covetous and morbid love? Was it for this the Comforter had come, Smiling at me and pointing with his hand? âWhat had He meant to have me think or do, Smiling and pointing? All at once I saw A way to save my darling from myself And make atonement for my grudging love! Under the sycamores and up the hill And down across the river, the wet road Went stretching cityward, silvered in the moon. I who had shrunk from sacrifice, even I, Who had refused God's blessing for my boy, Would take him in my arms and carry him Up to the altar of the miracle. I would not wait for daylight, nor the help Of any human friendship; I alone, Through the still miles of country, I alone, Only my arms to shield him and my feet To bear him: he should have no one to thank But me for that. I knew the way was long, But knew strength would be given. So I came. Soon the stars failed; the late moon faded too: I think my heart had sucked their beams from them To build more blue amid the murky night Its own miraculous day. From creeks and fields The fog climbed slowly, blotted out the road; And hid the signposts telling of the town; After a while rain fell, with sleet and snow. What did I care? Baby was snug and dry. Some day, when I was telling him of this, He would but hug me closer, hearing how The night conspired against us. Better hard Than easy, then: I almost felt regret My body was so capable and strong To do its errand. Honeyed drop by drop, The ghostly jealousy, loosening at my breast, Distilled into a dew of quiet tears And fell with splash of music in the wells And on the hidden rivers of my soul. The hardest part was coming through the town. The country, even when it hindered most, Seemed conscious of the thing I went to find. The rocks and bushes looming through the mist Questioned and acquiesced and understood; The trees and streams believed; the wind and rain, Even they, for all their temper, had some words Of faith and comfort. But the glaring streets, The dizzy traffic, the piled merchandise, The giant buildings swarming with fierce lifeâ Cared nothing for me. They had never heard Of me nor of my business. When I asked My way, a shade of pity or contempt Showed through men's kindnessâfor they all were kind. Daunted and chilled and very sick at heart, I walked the endless pavements. But at last The streets grew quieter; the houses seemed As if they might be homes where people lived; Then came the factories and cottages, And all was well again. Much more than well, For many sick and broken went my way, Alone or helped along by loving hands; And from a thousand eyes the famished hope Looked out at mineâwild, patient, querulous, But always hope and hope, a thousand tongues Speaking one word in many languages. In two hours He will come, they say, will stand There on the steps, above the waiting crowd, And touch with healing hands whoever asks Believingly, in spirit and in truth. Can such a mercy be, in these hard days? Is help still sent in such a way as that? Christ, I believe; pity my unbelief! JETSAM I wonder can this be the world it was At sunset? I remember the sky fell Green as pale meadows, at the long street-ends, But overhead the smoke-wrack hugged the roofs As if to shut the city from God's eyes Till dawn should quench the laughter and the lights. Beneath the gas flare stolid faces passed, Too dull for sin; old loosened lips set hard To drain the stale lees from the cup of sense; Or if a young face yearned from out the mist Made by its own bright hair, the eyes were wan With desolate fore-knowledge of the end. My life lay waste about me: as I walked, From the gross dark of unfrequented streets The face of my own youth peered forth at me, Struck white with pity at the thing I was; And globed in ghostly fire, thrice-virginal, With lifted face star-strong, went one who sang Lost verses from my youth's gold canticle. Out of the void dark came my face and hers One vivid momentâthen the street was there; Bloat shapes and mean eyes blotted the sear dusk; And in the curtained window of a house Whence sin reeked on the night, a shameful head Was silhouetted black as Satan's face Against eternal fires. I stumbled on Down the dark slope that reaches riverward, Stretching blind hands to find the throat of God And crush Him in his lies. The river lay Coiled in its factory filth and few lean trees. All was too hatefulâI could not die there! I whom the Spring had strained unto her breast, Whose lips had felt the wet vague lips of dawn. So under the thin willows' leprous shade And through the tangled ranks of riverweed I pushedâtill lo, God heard me! I came forth Where, 'neath the shoreless hush of region light, Through a new world, undreamed of, undesired, Beyond imagining of man's weary heart, Far to the white marge of the wondering sea This still plain widens, and this moon rains down Insufferable ecstasy of peace. My heart is man's heart, strong to bear this night's Unspeakable affliction of mute love That crazes lesser things. The rocks and clods Dissemble, feign a busy intercourse; The bushes deal in shadowy subterfuge, Lurk dull, dart spiteful out, make heartless signs, Utter awestricken purpose of no sense,â But I walk quiet, crush aside the hands Stretched furtively to drag me madmen's ways. I know the thing they suffer, and the tricks They must be at to help themselves endure. I would not be too boastful; I am weak, Too weak to put aside the utter ache Of this lone splendor long enough to see Whether the moon is still her white strange self Or something whiter, stranger, even the face Which by the changed face of my risen youth Sang, globed in fire, her golden canticle. I dare not look again; another gaze Might drive me to the wavering coppice there, Where bat-winged madness brushed me, the wild laugh Of naked nature crashed across my blood. So rank it was with earthy presences, Faun-shapes in goatish dance, young witches' eyes Slanting deep invitation, whinnying calls Ambiguous, shocks and whirlwinds of wild mirth,â They had undone me in the darkness there, But that within me, smiting through my lids Lowered to shut in the thick whirl of sense, The dumb light ached and rummaged, and without, The soaring splendor summoned me aloud To leave the low dank thickets of the flesh Where man meets beast and makes his lair with him, For spirit reaches of the strenuous vast, Where stalwart stars reap grain to make the bread God breaketh at his tables and is glad. I came out in the moonlight cleansed and strong, And gazed up at the lyric face to see All sweetness tasted of in earthen cups Ere it be dashed and spilled, all radiance flung Beyond experience, every benison dream, Treasured and mystically crescent there. O, who will shield me from her? Who will place A veil between me and the fierce in-throng Of her inexorable benedicite? See, I have loved her well and been with her! Through tragic twilights when the stricken sea Groveled with fear; or when she made her throne In imminent cities built of gorgeous winds And paved with lightnings; or when the sobering stars Would lead her home 'mid wealth of plundered May Along the violet slopes of evensong. Of all the sights that starred the dreamy year, For me one sight stood peerless and apart: Bright rivers tacit; low hills prone and dumb; Forests that hushed their tiniest voice to hear; Skies for the unutterable advent robed In purple like the opening iris buds; And by some lone expectant pool, one tree Whose grey boughs shivered with excess of awe,â As with preluding gush of amber light, And herald trumpets softly lifted through, Across the palpitant horizon marge Crocus-filleted came the singing moon. Out of her changing lights I wove my youth A place to dwell in, sweet and spiritual, And all the bitter years of my exile My heart has called afar off unto her. Lo, after many days love finds its own! The futile adorations, the waste tears, The hymns that fluttered low in the false dawn, She has uptreasured as a lover's gifts; They are the mystic garment that she wears Against the bridal, and the crocus flowers She twined her brow with at the going forth; They are the burden of the song she made In coming through the quiet fields of space, And breathe between her passion-parted lips Calling me out along the flowering road Which summers through the dimness of the sea. Hark, where the deep feels round its thousand shores To find remembered respite, and far drawn Through weed-strewn shelves and crannies of the coast The myriad silence yearns to myriad speech. O sea that yearns a day, shall thy tongues be So eloquent, and heart, shall all thy tongues Be dumb to speak thy longing? Say I hold Life as a broken jewel in my hand, And fain would buy a little love with it For comfort, say I fain would make it shine Once in remembering eyes ere it be dust,â Were life not worthy spent? Then what of this, When all my spirit hungers to repay The beauty that has drenched my soul with peace? Once at a simple turning of the way I met God walking; and although the dawn Was large behind Him, and the morning stars Circled and sang about his face as birds About the fieldward morning cottager, My coward heart said faintly, âLet us haste! Day grows and it is far to market-town.â Once where I lay in darkness after fight, Sore smitten, thrilled a little thread of song Searching and searching at my muffled sense Until it shook sweet pangs through all my blood, And I beheld one globed in ghostly fire Singing, star-strong, her golden canticle; And her mouth sang, âThe hosts of Hate roll past, A dance of dust motes in the sliding sun; Love's battle comes on the wide wings of storm, From east to west one legion! Wilt thou strive?â Then, since the splendor of her sword-bright gaze Was heavy on me with yearning and with scorn My sick heart muttered, âYea, the little strife, Yet see, the grievous wounds! I fain would sleep.â O heart, shalt thou not once be strong to go Where all sweet throats are calling, once be brave To slake with deed thy dumbness? Let us go The path her singing face looms low to point, Pendulous, blanched with longing, shedding flame Of silver on the brown grope of the flood; For all my spirit's soilure is put by And all my body's soilure, lacking now But the last lustral sacrament of death To make me clean for those near-searching eyes That question yonder whether all be well, And pause a little ere they dare rejoice. Question and be thou answered, passionate face! For I am worthy, worthy now at last After so long unworth; strong now at last To give myself to beauty and be saved; Now, being man, to give myself to thee, As once the tumult of my boyish heart Companioned thee with rapture through the world, Forth from a land whereof no poet's lip Made mention how the leas were lily-sprent, Into a land God's eyes had looked not on To love the tender bloom upon the hills. To-morrow, when the fishers come at dawn Upon that shell of me the sea has tossed To land, as fit for earth to use again, Men, meeting at the shops and corner streets, Will speak a word of pity, glossing o'er With altered accent, dubious sweep of hand, Their virile, just contempt for one who failed. But they can never cast my earnings up, Who know so well my losses. Even you Who in the mild light of the spirit walk And hold yourselves acquainted with the truth, Be not too swift to judge and cast me out! You shall find other, nobler ways than mine To work your soul's redemption,âglorious noons Of battle 'neath the heaven-suspended sign, And nightly refuge 'neath God's Ã¦gis-rim; Increase of wisdom, and acquaintance held With the heart's austerities; still governance, And ripening of the blood in the weekday sun To make the full-orbed consecrated fruit At life's end for the Sabbath supper meet. I shall not sit beside you at that feast, For ere a seedling of my golden tree Pushed off its petals to get room to grow, I stripped the boughs to make an April gaud And wreathe a spendthrift garland for my hair. But mine is not the failure God deplores; For I of old am beauty's votarist, Long recreant, often foiled and led astray, But resolute at last to seek her there Where most she does abide, and crave with tears That she assoil me of my blemishment. Low looms her singing face to point the way, Pendulous, blanched with longing, shedding flame Of silver on the brown grope of the flood. The stars are for me; the horizon wakes Its pilgrim chanting; and the little sand Grows musical of hope beneath my feet. The waves that leap to meet my swimming breast Gossip sweet secrets of the light-drenched way, And when the deep throbs of the rising surge Pulse upward with me, and a rain of wings Blurs round the moon's pale place, she stoops to reach Still welcome of bright hands across the wave And sings low, low, globed all in ghostly fire, Lost verses from my youth's gold canticle. THE BRUTE Through his might men work their wills. They have boweled out the hills For food to keep him toiling in the cages they have wrought; And they fling him, hour by hour, Limbs of men to give him power; Brains of men to give him cunning; and for dainties to devour Children's souls, the little worth; hearts of women, cheaply bought: He takes them and he breaks them, but he gives them scanty thought. For about the noisy land, Roaring, quivering 'neath his hand, His thoughts brood fierce and sullen or laugh in lust of pride O'er the stubborn things that he, Breaks to dust and brings to be. Some he mightily establishes, some flings down utterly. There is thunder in his stride, nothing ancient can abide, When he hales the hills together and bridles up the tide. Quietude and loveliness, Holy sights that heal and bless, They are scattered and abolished where his iron hoof is set; When he splashes through the brae Silver streams are choked with clay, When he snorts the bright cliffs crumble and the woods go down like hay; He lairs in pleasant cities, and the haggard people fret Squalid 'mid their new-got riches, soot-begrimed and desolate. They who caught and bound him tight Laughed exultant at his might, Saying, âNow behold, the good time comes for the weariest and the least! We will use this lusty knave: No more need for men to slave; We may rise and look about us and have knowledge ere the grave.â But the Brute said in his breast, Till the mills I grind have ceased, The riches shall be dust of dust dry ashes be the feast! âOn the strong and cunning few Cynic favors I will strew; I will stuff their maw with overplus until their spirit dies; From the patient and the low I will take the joys they know; They shall hunger after vanities and still an-hungered go. Madness shall be on the people, ghastly jealousies arise; Brother's blood shall cry on brother up the dead and empty skies. âI will burn and dig and hack Till the heavens suffer lack; God shall feel a pleasure fail Him, crying to his cherubim, âWho hath flung you mud-ball there Where my world went green and fair?â I shall laugh and hug me, hearing how his sentinels declare, â'T is the Brute they chained to labor! He has made the bright earth dim. Store of wares and pelf a plenty, but they got no good of him.ââ So he plotted in his rage: So he deals it, age by age. But even as he roared his curse a still small Voice befell; Lo, a still and pleasant voice bade them none the less rejoice, For the Brute must bring the good time on; he has no other choice. He may struggle, sweat, and yell, but he knows exceeding well He must work them out salvation ere they send him back to hell. All the desert that he made He must treble bless with shade, In primal wastes set precious seed of rapture and of pain; All the strongholds that he built For the powers of greed and guiltâ He must stew their bastions down the sea and choke their towers with silt; He must make the temples clean for the gods to come again, And lift the lordly cities under skies without a stain. In a very cunning tether He must lead the tyrant weather; He must loose the curse of Adam from the worn neck of the race; He must cast out hate and fear, Dry away each fruitless tear, And make the fruitful tears to gush from the deep heart and clear. He must give each man his portion, each his pride and worthy place; He must batter down the arrogant and lift the weary face, On each vile mouth set purity, on each low forehead grace. Then, perhaps, at the last day, They will whistle him away, Lay a hand upon his muzzle in the face of God, and say, âHonor, Lord, the Thing we tamed! Let him not be scourged or blamed, Even through his wrath and fierceness was thy fierce wroth world reclaimed! Honor Thou thy servants' servant; let thy justice now be shown.â Then the Lord will heed their saying, and the Brute come to his own, 'Twixt the Lion and the Eagle, by the armpost of the Throne. THE MENAGERIE Thank God my brain is not inclined to cut Such capers every day! I'm just about Mellow, but thenâThere goes the tent-flap shut. Rain 's in the wind. I thought so: every snout Was twitching when the keeper turned me out. That screaming parrot makes my blood run cold. Gabriel's trump! the big bull elephant Squeals âRain!â to the parched herd. The monkeys scold, And jabber that it's rain water they want. (It makes me sick to see a monkey pant.) I'll foot it home, to try and make believe I'm sober. After this I stick to beer, And drop the circus when the sane folks leave. A man's a fool to look at things too near: They look back, and begin to cut up queer. Beasts do, at any rate; especially Wild devils caged. They have the coolest way Of being something else than what you see: You pass a sleek young zebra nosing hay, A nylghau looking bored and distinguÃ©,â And think you've seen a donkey and a bird. Not on your life! Just glance back, if you dare. The zebra chews, the nylghau has n't stirred; But something's happened, Heaven knows what or where To freeze your scalp and pompadour your hair. I'm not precisely an Ã¦olian lute Hung in the wandering winds of sentiment, But drown me if the ugliest, meanest brute Grunting and fretting in that sultry tent Did n't just floor me with embarrassment! 'T was like a thunder-clap from out the clear,â One minute they were circus beasts, some grand, Some ugly, some amusing, and some queer: Rival attractions to the hobo band, The flying jenny, and the peanut stand. Next minute they were old hearth-mates of mine! Lost people, eyeing me with such a stare! Patient, satiric, devilish, divine; A gaze of hopeless envy, squalid care, Hatred, and thwarted love, and dim despair. Within my blood my ancient kindred spoke,â Grotesque and monstrous voices, heard afar Down ocean caves when behemoth awoke, Or through fern forests roared the plesiosaur Locked with the giant-bat in ghastly war. And suddenly, as in a flash of light, I saw great Nature working out her plan; Through all her shapes from mastodon to mite Forever groping, testing, passing on To find at last the shape and soul of Man. Till in the fullness of accomplished time, Comes brother Forepaugh, upon business bent, Tracks her through frozen and through torrid clime, And shows us, neatly labeled in a tent, The stages of her huge experiment; Blabbing aloud her shy and reticent hours; Dragging to light her blinking, slothful moods; Publishing fretful seasons when her powers Worked wild and sullen in her solitudes, Or when her mordant laughter shook the woods. Here, round about me, were her vagrant births; Sick dreams she had, fierce projects she essayed; Her qualms, her fiery prides, her crazy mirths; The troublings of her spirit as she strayed, Cringed, gloated, mocked, was lordly, was afraid, On that long road she went to seek mankind; Here were the darkling coverts that she beat To find the Hider she was sent to find; Here the distracted footprints of her feet Whereby her soul's Desire she came to greet. But why should they, her botch-work, turn about And stare disdain at me, her finished job? Why was the place one vast suspended shout Of laughter? Why did all the daylight throb With soundless guffaw and dumb-stricken sob? Helpless I stood among those awful cages; The beasts were walking loose, and I was bagged! I, I, last product of the toiling ages, Goal of heroic feet that never lagged,â A little man in trousers, slightly jagged. Deliver me from such another jury! The Judgment-day will be a picnic to 't. Their satire was more dreadful than their fury, And worst of all was just a kind of brute Disgust, and giving up, and sinking mute. Survival of the fittest, adaptation, And all their other evolution terms, Seem to omit one small consideration, To wit, that tumblebugs and angleworms Have souls: there's soul in everything that squirms. And souls are restless, plagued, impatient things, All dream and unaccountable desire; Crawling, but pestered with the thought of wings; Spreading through every inch of earth's old mire Mystical hanker after something higher. Wishes are horses, as I understand. I guess a wistful polyp that has strokes Of feeling faint to gallivant on land Will come to be a scandal to his folks; Legs he will sprout, in spite of threats and jokes. And at the core of every life that crawls Or runs or flies or swims or vegetatesâ Churning the mammoth's heart-blood, in the galls Of shark and tiger planting gorgeous hates, Lighting the love of eagles for their mates; Yes, in the dim brain of the jellied fish That is and is not livingâmoved and stirred From the beginning a mysterious wish, A vision, a command, a fatal Word: The name of Man was uttered, and they heard. Upward along the Ã¦ons of old war They sought him: wing and shank-bone, claw and bill Were fashioned and rejected; wide and far They roamed the twilight jungles of their will; But still they sought him, and desired him still. Man they desired, but mind you, Perfect Man, The radiant and the loving, yet to be! I hardly wonder, when they came to scan The upshot of their strenuosity, They gazed with mixed emotions upon me. Well, my advice to you is, Face the creatures, Or spot them sideways with your weather eye, Just to keep tab on their expansive features; It is n't pleasant when you're stepping high To catch a giraffe smiling on the sly. If nature made you graceful, don't get gay Back-to before the hippopotamus; If meek and godly, find some place to play Besides right where three mad hyenas fuss: You may hear language that we won't discuss. If you're a sweet thing in a flower-bed hat, Or her best fellow with your tie tucked in, Don't squander love's bright springtime girding at An old chimpanzee with an Irish chin: There may be hidden meaning in his grin. THE GOLDEN JOURNEY All day he drowses by the sail With dreams of her, and all night long The broken waters are at song Of how she lingers, wild and pale, When all the temple lights are dumb, And weaves her spells to make him come. The wide sea traversed, he will stand With straining eyes, until the shoal Green water from the prow shall roll Upon the yellow strip of sandâ Searching some fern-hid tangled way Into the forest old and grey. Then he will leap upon the shore, And cast one look up at the sun, Over his loosened locks will run The dawn breeze, and a bird will pour Its rapture out to make life seem Too sweet to leave for such a dream. But all the swifter will he go Through the pale, scattered asphodels, Down mote-hung dusk of olive dells, To where the ancient basins throw Fleet threads of blue and trembling zones Of gold upon the temple stones. There noon keeps just a twilight trace; Twixt love and hate, and death and birth, No man may choose; nor sobs nor mirth May enter in that haunted place. All day the fountain sphynx lets drip Slow drops of silence from her lip. To hold the porch-roof slender girls Of milk-white marble stand arow; Doubt never blurs a single brow, And never the noon's faintness curls From their expectant hush of pride The lips the god has glorified. But these things he will barely view, Or if he stay to heed them, still But as the lark the lights that spill From out the sun it soars unto, Where, past the splendors and the heats, The sun's heart's self forever beats. For wide the brazen doors will swing Soon as his sandals touch the pave; The anxious light inside will wave And tremble to a lunar ring About the form that lieth prone Before the dreadful altar-stone. She will not look or speak or stir, But with drowned lips and cheeks death-white Will lie amid the pool of light, Until, grown faint with thirst of her, He shall bow down his face and sink Breathless beneath the eddying brink. Then a swift music will begin, And as the brazen doors shut slow, There will be hurrying to and fro, And lights and calls and silver din, While through the star-freaked swirl of air The god's sweet cruel eyes will stare. HEART'S WILD-FLOWER To-night her lids shall lift again, slow, soft, with vague desire, And lay about my breast and brain their hush of spirit fire, And I shall take the sweet of pain as the laborer his hire. And though no word shall e'er be said to ease the ghostly sting, And though our hearts, unhoused, unfed, must still go wandering, My sign is set upon her head while stars do meet and sing. Not such a sign as women wear who make their foreheads tame With life's long tolerance, and bear love's sweetest, humblest name, Nor such a passion eateth bare with its crown of tears and flame. Nor such a sign as happy friend sets on his friend's dear brow When meadow-pipings break and blend to a key of autumn woe, And the woodland says playtime 's at end, best unclasp hands and go. But where she strays, through blight or blooth, one fadeless flower she wears, A little gift God gave my youth,âwhose petals dim were fears, Awes, adorations, songs of ruth, hesitancies, and tears. O heart of mine, with all thy powers of white beatitude, What are the dearest of God's dowers to the children of his blood? How blow the shy, shy wilding flowers in the hollows of his wood! HARMONICS This string upon my harp was best beloved: I thought I knew its secrets through and through; Till an old man, whose young eyes lightened blue 'Neath his white hair, bent over me and moved His fingers up and down, and broke the wire To such a laddered music, rung on rung, As from the patriarch's pillow skyward sprung Crowded with wide-flung wings and feet of fire. O vibrant heart! so metely tuned and strung That any untaught hand can draw from thee One clear gold note that makes the tired years youngâ What of the time when Love had whispered me Where slept thy nodes, and my hand pausefully Gave to the dim harmonics voice and tongue? ON THE RIVER The faint stars wake and wonder, Fade and find heart anew; Above us and far under Sphereth the watchful blue. Silent she sits, outbending, A wild pathetic grace, A beauty strange, heart-rending, Upon her hair and face. O spirit cries that sever The cricket's level drone! O to give o'er endeavor And let love have its own! Within the mirrored bushes There wakes a little stir; The white-throat moves, and hushes Her nestlings under her. Beneath, the lustrous river, The watchful sky o'erhead. God, God, that Thou should'st ever Poison thy children's bread! THE BRACELET OF GRASS The opal heart of afternoon Was clouding on to throbs of storm, Ashen within the ardent west The lips of thunder muttered harm, And as a bubble like to break Hung heaven's trembling amethyst, When with the sedge-grass by the lake I braceleted her wrist. And when the ribbon grass was tied, Sad with the happiness we planned, Palm linked in palm we stood awhile And watched the raindrops dot the sand; Until the anger of the breeze Chid all the lake's bright breathing down, And ravished all the radiancies From her deep eyes of brown. We gazed from shelter on the storm, And through our hearts swept ghostly pain To see the shards of day sweep past, Broken, and none might mend again. Broken, that none shall ever mend; Loosened, that none shall ever tie. O the wind and the wind, will it never end? O the sweeping past of the ruined sky! THE DEPARTURE I I sat beside the glassy evening sea, One foot upon the thin horn of my lyre, And all its strings of laughter and desire Crushed in the rank wet grasses heedlessly; Nor did my dull eyes care to question how The boat close by had spread its saffron sails, Nor what might mean the coffers and the bales, And streaks of new wine on the gilded prow. Neither was wonder in me when I saw Fair women step therein, though they were fair Even to adoration and to awe, And in the gracious fillets of their hair Were blossoms from a garden I had known, Sweet mornings ere the apple buds were blown. II One gazed steadfast into the dying west With lips apart to greet the evening star; And one with eyes that caught the strife and jar Of the sea's heart, followed the sunward breast Of a lone gull; from a slow harp one drew Blind music like a laugh or like a wail; And in the uncertain shadow of the sail One wove a crown of berries and of yew. Yet even as I said with dull desire, âAll these were mine, and one was mine indeed,â The smoky music burst into a fire, And I was left alone in my great need, One foot upon the thin horn of my lyre And all its strings crushed in the dripping weed. FADED PICTURES Only two patient eyes to stare Out of the canvas. All the restâ The warm green gown, the small hands pressed Light in the lap, the braided hair That must have made the sweet low brow So earnest, centuries ago, When some one saw it change and glowâ All faded! Just the eyes burn now. I dare say people pass and pass Before the blistered little frame, And dingy work without a name Stuck in behind its square of glass. But I, well, I left Raphael Just to come drink these eyes of hers, To think away the stains and blurs And make all new again and well. Only, for tears my head will bow, Because there on my heart's last wall, Scarce one tint left to tell it all, A picture keeps its eyes, somehow. A GREY DAY Grey drizzling mists the moorlands drape, Rain whitens the dead sea, From headland dim to sullen cape Grey sails creep wearily. I know not how that merchantman Has found the heart; but 't is her plan Seaward her endless course to shape. Unreal as insects that appall A drunkard's peevish brain, O'er the grey deep the dories crawl, Four-legged, with rowers twain: Midgets and minims of the earth, Across old ocean's vasty girth Toilingâheroic, comical! I wonder how that merchant's crew Have ever found the will! I wonder what the fishers do To keep them toiling still! I wonder how the heart of man Has patience to live out its span, Or wait until its dreams come true. THE RIDE BACK Before the coming of the dark, he dreamed An old-world faded story: of a knight, Much like in need to him, who was no knight! And of a road, much like the road his soul Groped over, desperate to meet Her soul. Beside the bed Death waited. And he dreamed. His limbs were heavy from the fight, His mail was dark with dust and blood; On this good horse they bound him tight, And on his breast they bound the rood To help him in the ride that night. When he crashed through the wood's wet rim, About the dabbled reeds a breeze Went moaning broken words and dim; The haggard shapes of twilight trees Caught with their scrawny hands at him. Between the doubtful aisles of day Strange folk and lamentable stood To maze and beckon him astray, But through the grey wrath of the wood He held right on his bitter way. When he came where the trees were thin, The moon sat waiting there to see; On her worn palm she laid her chin, And laughed awhile in sober glee To think how strong this knight had been. When he rode past the pallid lake The withered yellow stems of flags Stood breast-high for his horse to break; Lewd as the palsied lips of hags The petals in the moon did shake. When he came by the mountain wall, The snow upon the heights looked down And said, âThe sight is pitiful. The nostrils of his steed are brown With frozen blood; and he will fall.â The iron passes of the hills With question were importunate; And, but the sharp-tongued icy rills Had grown for once compassionate, The spiteful shades had had their wills. Just when the ache in breast and brain And the frost smiting at his face Had sealed his spirit up with pain, He came out in a better place, And morning lay across the plain. He saw the wet snails crawl and cling On fern-stalks where the rime had run, The careless birds went wing and wing, And in the low smile of the sun Life seemed almost a pleasant thing. Right on the panting charger swung Through the bright depths of quiet grass; The knight's lips moved as if they sung, And through the peace there came to pass The flattery of lute and tongue. From the mid-flowering of the mead There swelled a sob of minstrelsy, Faint sackbuts and the dreamy reed, And plaintive lips of maids thereby, And songs blown out like thistle seed. Forth from her maidens came the bride, And as his loosened rein fell slack He muttered, âIn their throats they lied Who said that I should ne'er win back To kiss her lips before I died!â SONG-FLOWER AND POPPY I IN NEW YORK He plays the deuce with my writing time, For the penny my sixth-floor neighbor throws; He finds me proud of my pondered rhyme, And he leaves meâwell, God knows It takes the shine from a tunester's line When a little mate of the deathless Nine Pipes up under your nose! For listen, there is his voice again, Wistful and clear and piercing sweet. Where did the boy find such a strain To make a dead heart beat? And how in the name of care can he bear To jet such a fountain into the air In this grey gulch of a street? Tuscan slopes or the Piedmontese? Umbria under the Apennine? South, where the terraced lemon-trees Round rich Sorrento shine? Venice moon on the smooth lagoon?â Where have I heard that aching tune, That boyish throat divine? Beyond my roofs and chimney pots A rag of sunset crumbles grey; Below, fierce radiance hangs in clots O'er the streams that never stay. Shrill and high, newsboys cry The worst of the city's infamy For one more sordid day. But my desire has taken sail For lands beyond, soft-horizoned: Down languorous leagues I hold the trail, From Marmalada, steeply throned Above high pastures washed with light, Where dolomite by dolomite Looms sheer and spectral-coned, To purple vineyards looking south On reaches of the still Tyrrhene; Virgilian headlands, and the mouth Of Tiber, where that ship put in To take the dead men home to God, Whereof Casella told the mode To the great Florentine. Up stairways blue with flowering weed I climb to hill-hung Bergamo; All day I watch the thunder breed Golden above the springs of Po, Till the voice makes sure its wavering lure, And by Assisi's portals pure I stand, with heart bent low. O hear, how it blooms in the blear dayfall, That flower of passionate wistful song! How it blows like a rose by the iron wall Of the city loud and strong. How it cries âNay, nayâ to the worldling's way, To the heart's clear dream how it whispers, âYea; Time comes, though the time is long.â Beyond my roofs and chimney piles Sunset crumbles, ragged, dire; The roaring street is hung for miles With fierce electric fire. Shrill and high, newsboys cry The gross of the planet's destiny Through one more sullen gyre. Stolidly the town flings down Its lust by day for its nightly lust; Who does his given stint, 't is known, Shall have his mug and crust.â Too base of mood, too harsh of blood, Too stout to seize the grosser good, Too hungry after dust! O hark! how it blooms in the falling dark, That flower of mystical yearning song: Sad as a hermit thrush, as a lark Uplifted, glad, and strong. Heart, we have chosen the better part! Save sacred love and sacred art Nothing is good for long. II AT ASSISI Before St. Francis' burg I wait, Frozen in spirit, faint with dread; His presence stands within the gate, Mild splendor rings his head. Gently he seems to welcome me: Knows he not I am quick, and he Is dead, and priest of the dead? I turn away from the grey church pile; I dare not enter, thus undone: Here in the roadside grass awhile I will lie and watch for the sun. Too purged of earth's good glee and strife, Too drained of the honied lusts of life, Was the peace these old saints won! And lo! how the laughing earth says no To the fear that mastered me; To the blood that aches and clamors so How it whispers âVerily.â Here by my side, marvelous-dyed, Bold stray-away from the courts of pride, A poppy-bell flaunts free. St. Francis sleeps upon his hill, And a poppy flower laughs down his creed; Triumphant light her petals spill, His shrines are dim indeed. Men build and plan, but the soul of man, Coming with haughty eyes to scan, Feels richer, wilder need. How long, old builder Time, wilt bide Till at thy thrilling word Life's crimson pride shall have to bride The spirit's white accord, Within that gate of good estate Which thou must build us soon or late, Hoar workman of the Lord? HOW THE MEAD-SLAVE WAS SET FREE Nay, move not! Sit just as you are, Under the carved wings of the chair. The hearth-glow sifting through your hair Turns every dim pearl to a star Dawn-drowned in floods of brightening air. I have been thinking of that night When all the wide hall burst to blaze With spears caught up, thrust fifty ways To find my throat, while I lay white And sick with joy, to think the days I dragged out in your hateful Northâ A slave, constrained at banquet's need To fill the black bull's horns with mead For drunken sea-thievesâwere henceforth Cast from me as a poison weed, While Death thrust roses in my hands! But you, who knew the flowers he had Were no such roses ripe and glad As nod in my far southern lands, But pallid things to make men sad, Put back the spears with one calm hand, Raised on your knee my wondering head, Wiped off the trickling drops of red From my torn forehead with a strand Of your bright loosened hair, and said: âSea-rovers! would you kill a skald? This boy has hearkened Odin sing Unto the clang and winnowing Of raven's wings. His heart is thralled To music, as to some strong king; âAnd this great thraldom works disdain Of lesser serving. Once release These bonds he bears, and he may please To give you guerdon sweet as rain To sailors calmed in thirsty seas.â Then, having soothed their rage to rest, You led me to old Skagi's throne, Where yellow gold rims in the stone; And in my arms, against my breast, Thrust his great harp of walrus bone. How they came crowding, tunes on tunes! How good it was to touch the strings And feel them thrill like happy things That flutter from the grey cocoons On hedge rows, in your gradual springs! All grew a blur before my sight, As when the stealthy white fog slips At noonday on the staggering ships; I saw one single spot of light, Your white face, with its eager lipsâ And so I sang to that. O thou Who liftedst me from out my shame! Wert thou content when Skagi came, Put his own chaplet on my brow, And bent and kissed his own harp-frame? A DIALOGUE IN PURGATORY Poi disse un altro.... âIo son Buonconte: Giovanna o altri non ha di me cura; Per ch' io vo tra costor con bassa fronte.â Seguito il terzo spirito al secondo, âRicorditi di me, che son la Pia; Siena mi fe, disfecemi Maremma. Salsi colui che inannellata pria Disposata m' avea colla sua gemma.â Purgatorio, Canto V. I BUONCONTE Sister, the sun has ceased to shine; By companies of twain and trine Stars gather; from the sea The moon comes momently. On all the roads that ring our hill The sighing and the hymns are still; It is our time to gain Strength for to-morrow's pain. Yet still your eyes are wholly bent Upon the way that Virgil went, Following Sordello's sign, With the dark Florentine. Night now has barred their upward track: There where the mountain-side folds back And in the Vale of Flowers The Princes count their hours Those three friends sit in the clear starlight With the green-clad angels left and right,â Soul made by wakeful soul More earnest for the goal. So let us, sister, though our place Is barren of that Valley's grace, Sit hand in hand, till we Seem rich as those friends be. II LA PIA Brother, 't were sweet your hand to feel In mine; it would a little heal The shame that makes me poor, And dumb at the heart's core. But where our spirits felt Love's dearth, Down on the green and pleasant earth, Remains the fleshly shell, Love's garment tangible. So now our hands have naught to say: Heart unto heart some other way Must utter forth its pain, Must glee or comfort gain. Ah, no! For souls like you and me Some comfort waits, but never glee: Not yours the young men's singing In Heaven, at the bride-bringing; Not mine, beside God's living waters, Dance of the marriageable daughters, The laughter and the ease Beneath His summer trees. III BUONCONTE In fair Arezzo's halls and bowers My Giovanna speeds her hours Delicately, nor cares To shorten by her prayers My days upon this mount of ruth: If those who come from earth speak sooth, Though still I call and call, She does not heed at all. And if aright your words I read At Dante's passing, he you wed Dipped from the drains of Hell The marriage hydromel. O therefore, while the moon intense Holds yonder dreaming sea suspense, And round the shadowy coasts Gather the wistful ghosts, Let us sit quiet all the night, And wonder, wonder on the light Worn by those spirits fair Whom Love has not left bare. IV LA PIA Even as theirs, the chance was mine To meet and mate beneath Love's sign, To feel in soul and sense The solemn influence Which, breathed upon a man or maid, Maketh forever unafraid, Though life with death unite That spirit to affright,â Which lifts the changÃ¨d heart high up, As the priest lifts the changÃ¨d cup, Boldens the feet to pace Before God's proving face. O just a thought beyond the blue The wings of the dove yearned down and through! Even now I hear and hear How near they were, how near! I murmur not. Rightly disgraced, The weak hand stretched abroad in haste For gifts barely allowed The tacit, strong, and proud. But therefore was I so intent To watch where Dante onward went With the Roman spirit pure And the grave troubadour, Because my mind was busy then With the loves that wait those gentle men: Cunizza one; and one Bice, above the sun; And for the other, more and less Than woman's near-felt tenderness, A million voices dim Praising him, praising him. V BUONCONTE The waves that wash this mountain's base Were crimson in the sun's low rays, When, singing high and fast, An angel downward passed, To bid some patient soul arise And make it fair for Paradise; And upward, so attended, That soul its journey wended; Yet you, who in these lower rings Wait for the coming of such wings, Turned not your eyes to view Whether they came for you, But watched, but watched great Virgil stayed Greeting Sordello's couchant shade, Which to salute him rose Like lion from its pose; While humbly by those lords of song Stood he whose living limbs are strong To mount where Mary's bliss Is shed on Beatrice. On him your gaze was fastened, more Than on those great names Mantua bore: Your eyes hold the distress Still, of that wistfulness. Yea, fit he seemed much love to rouse His pilgrim lips and iron brows Grew like a woman's, dim, While you held speech with him; And troubled came his mortal breath The while I told him of my death; His looks were changed and wan When Virgil led him on. VI LA PIA E'er since Casella came this morn, Newly o'er yonder ocean borne, Bound upward for the choir Who purge themselves in fire, And from that meinie he was of Stayed backward at my cry of love, To speak awhile with me Of life and Tuscany, And, parting, told us how e'er day Was done, Dante would come this way, With mortal feet, to find His sweetheart, sky-enshrined,â E'er since Casella spoke such news My heart has lain in a golden muse, Picturing him and her, What starry ones they were. And now the moon sheds its compassion O'er the hushed mount, I try to fashion The manner of their meeting, Their few first words of greeting. O well for them, with claspÃ¨d hands, Unshamed amid the heavenly bands! They hear no pitying pair Of old-time lovers there Look down and say in an undertone, âThis latest-come, who comes alone, Was still alone on earth, And lonely from his birth.â Nor feel a sudden whisper mar God's weather, âDost thou see the scar That spirit hideth so? Who dealt her such a blow âThat God can hardly wipe it out?â And answer, âShe gave love, no doubt, To one who saw not fit To set much store by it.â THE DAGUERREOTYPE This, then, is she, My mother as she looked at seventeen, When she first met my father. Young incredibly, Younger than spring, without the faintest trace Of disappointment, weariness, or tean Upon the childlike earnestness and grace Of the waiting face. These close-wound ropes of pearl (Or common beads made precious by their use) Seem heavy for so slight a throat to wear; But the low bodice leaves the shoulders bare And half the glad swell of the breast, for news That now the woman stirs within the girl. And yet, Even so, the loops and globes Of beaten gold And jet Hung, in the stately way of old, From the ears' drooping lobes On festivals and Lord's-day of the week, Show all too matron-sober for the cheek,â Which, now I look again, is perfect child, Or noâor noâ't is girlhood's very self, Moulded by some deep, mischief-ridden elf So meek, so maiden mild, But startling the close gazer with the sense Of passions forest-shy and forest-wild, And delicate delirious merriments. As a moth beats sidewise And up and over, and tries To skirt the irresistible lure Of the flame that has him sure, My spirit, that is none too strong to-day, Flutters and makes delay,â Pausing to wonder on the perfect lips, Lifting to muse upon the low-drawn hair And each hid radiance there, But powerless to stem the tide-race bright, The vehement peace which drifts it toward the light Where soonâah, now, with cries Of grief and giving-up unto its gain It shrinks no longer nor denies, But dips Hurriedly home to the exquisite heart of pain,â And all is well, for I have seen them plain, The unforgettable, the unforgotten eyes! Across the blinding gush of these good tears They shine as in the sweet and heavy years When by her bed and chair We children gathered jealously to share The sunlit aura breathing myrrh and thyme, Where the sore-stricken body made a clime Gentler than May and pleasanter than rhyme, Holier and more mystical than prayer. God, how thy ways are strange! That this should be, even this, The patient head Which suffered years ago the dreary change! That these so dewy lips should be the same As those I stooped to kiss And heard my harrowing half-spoken name, A little ere the one who bowed above her, Our father and her very constant lover, Rose stoical, and we knew that she was dead. Then I, who could not understand or share His antique nobleness, Being unapt to bear The insults which time flings us for our proof, Fled from the horrible roof Into the alien sunshine merciless, The shrill satiric fields ghastly with day, Raging to front God in his pride of sway And hurl across the lifted swords of fate That ringed Him where He sat My puny gage of scorn and desolate hate Which somehow should undo Him, after all! That this girl face, expectant, virginal, Which gazes out at me Boon as a sweetheart, as if nothing loth (Save for the eyes, with other presage stored) To pledge me troth, And in the kingdom where the heart is lord Take sail on the terrible gladness of the deep Whose winds the grey Norns keep,â That this should be indeed The flesh which caught my soul, a flying seed, Out of the to and fro Of scattering hands where the seedsman Mage, Stooping from star to star and age to age Sings as he sows! That underneath this breast Nine moons I fed Deep of divine unrest, While over and over in the dark she said, âBlessÃ¨d! but not as happier children blessedââ That this should be Even she.... God, how with time and change Thou makest thy footsteps strange! Ah, now I know They play upon me, and it is not so. Why, 't is a girl I never saw before, A little thing to flatter and make weep, To tease until her heart is sore, Then kiss and clear the score; A gypsy run-the-fields, A little liberal daughter of the earth, Good for what hour of truancy and mirth The careless season yields Hither-side the flood of the year and yonder of the neap; Then thank you, thanks again, and twenty light good-byes.â O shrined above the skies, Frown not, clear brow, Darken not, holy eyes! Thou knowest well I know that it is thou! Only to save me from such memories As would unman me quite, Here in this web of strangeness caught And prey to troubled thought Do I devise These foolish shifts and slight; Only to shield me from the afflicting sense Of some waste influence Which from this morning face and lustrous hair Breathes on me sudden ruin and despair. In any other guise, With any but this girlish depth of gaze, Your coming had not so unsealed and poured The dusty amphoras where I had stored The drippings of the winepress of my days. I think these eyes foresee, Now in their unawakened virgin time, Their mother's pride in me, And dream even now, unconsciously, Upon each soaring peak and sky-hung lea You pictured I should climb. Broken premonitions come, Shapes, gestures visionary, Not as once to maiden Mary The manifest angel with fresh lilies came Intelligibly calling her by name; But vanishingly, dumb, Thwarted and bright and wild, As heralding a sin-defiled, Earth-encumbered, blood-begotten, passionate man-child, Who yet should be a trump of mighty call Blown in the gates of evil kings To make them fall; Who yet should be a sword of flame before The soul's inviolate door To beat away the clang of hellish wings; Who yet should be a lyre Of high unquenchable desire In the day of little things.â Look, where the amphoras, The yield of many days, Trod by my hot soul from the pulp of self And set upon the shelf In sullen pride The Vineyard-master's tasting to abideâ O mother mine! Are these the bringings-in, the doings fine, Of him you used to praise? Emptied and overthrown The jars lie strown. These, for their flavor duly nursed, Drip from the stopples vinegar accursed; These, I thought honied to the very seal, Dry, dry,âa little acid meal, A pinch of mouldy dust, Sole leavings of the amber-mantling must; These, rude to look upon, But flasking up the liquor dearest won, Through sacred hours and hard, With watching and with wrestlings and with grief, Even of these, of these in chief, The stale breath sickens, reeking from the shard. Nothing is left. Ay, how much less than naught! What shall be said or thought Of the slack hours and waste imaginings, The cynic rending of the wings, Known to that froward, that unreckoning heart Whereof this brewage was the precious part, Treasured and set away with furtive boast? O dear and cruel ghost, Be merciful, be just! See, I was yours and I am in the dust. Then look not so, as if all things were well! Take your eyes from me, leave me to my shame, Or else, if gaze they must, Steel them with judgment, darken them with blame; But by the ways of light ineffable You bade me go and I have faltered from, By the low waters moaning out of hell Whereto my feet have come, Lay not on me these intolerable Looks of rejoicing love, of pride, of happy trust! Nothing dismayed? By all I say and all I hint not made Afraid? O then, stay by me! Let These eyes afflict me, cleanse me, keep me yet Brave eyes and true! See how the shriveled heart, that long has lain Dead to delight and pain, Stirs, and begins again To utter pleasant life, as if it knew The wintry days were through; As if in its awakening boughs it heard The quick, sweet-spoken bird. Strong eyes and brave, Inexorable to save!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SECOND COMING And Later Poems SECOND COMING Once, by an arch of ancient stone, Beneath Italian olive-trees (In pentecostal youth, too prone To visions such as these), And now a second time, to-day, Yonder, an hour ago! 'T is strange. âThe hot beach shelving to the bay, That far white mountain range, The motley town where Turk and Greek Spit scorn and hatred as I pass; Seraglio windows, doors that reek Sick perfume of the mass; The muezzin cry from Allah's tower, French sailors singing in the street; The Western meets the Eastern power, And minglesâthis is Crete. Yonder on snowy Ida, Zeus Was cradled; through those mountain haunts The new moon hurried, letting loose The raving Corybants, Who after thrid the Cyclades To Thebes of Cadmos, with the slim Wild god for whom Euripides Fashioned the deathless hymn. And yonder, ere in Ajalon Young Judah's lion ramped for war, DÃ¦dalus built the Knossian House of the Minotaur. â'T is strange! No wonder and no dread Was on me; hardly even surprise. I knew before he raised his head Or fixed me with his eyes That it was he; far off I knew The leaning figure by the boat, The long straight gown of faded hue; The hair that round his throat Fell forward as he bent in speech Above the naked sailor there, Calking his vessel on the beach, Full in the noonday glare. Sharp rang the sailor's mallet-stroke Pounding the tow into the seam; He paused and mused, and would have spoke, Lifting great eyes of dream Unto those eyes which slowly turnedâ As once before, even so nowâ Till full on mine their passion burned With, âYes, and is it thou?â Then o'er the face about to speak Again he leaned; the sunburnt hair, Fallen forward, hid the tawny cheek; And I who, for my share, Had but the instant's gaze, no more, And sweat and shuddering of the mind, Stumbled along the dazzling shore, Until a cool sweet wind From far-off Ida's silver caves Said, âStayâ; and here I sit the while. âSilken Mediterranean waves, From isle to fabled isle, Flame softly north to Sunium, And west by England's war-cliff strong To where Ulysses' men saw loom The mount of Dante's song. As far as where the coast-line dies In sharp sun-dazzle, goes the light Dance-dance of amber butterflies Above the beach-flowers, bright And jealous as the sudden blood The lovers of these island girls Spill in their frays; o'er flower and bud The light dance dips and whirls. And all my being, for an hour, Has sat in stupor, without thought, Empty of memory, love, or power, A dumb wild creature caught In toils of purpose not its own! But now at last the ebbed will turns; Feeding on spirit, blood, and bone, The ghostly protest burns. âYea, it is I, 't is I indeed! But who art thou, and plannest what? Beyond all use, beyond all need! Importunate, unbesought, âUnwelcome, unendurable! To the vague boy I was beforeâ O unto him thou camest well; But now, a boy no more, âFirm-seated in my proper good, Clear-operant in my functions due, Potent and plenteous of my mood,â What hast thou here to do? âYes, I have loved theeâlove thee, yes; But alsoâhear'st thou?âalso him Who out of Ida's wilderness Over the bright sea-rim, âWith shaken cones and mystic dance, To Dirce and her seven waters Led on the raving Corybants, And lured the Theban daughters âTo play on the delirious hills Three summer days, three summer nights, Where wert thou when these had their wills? How liked thee their delights? âPast Melos, Delos, to the straits, The waters roll their spangled mirth, And westward, through Gibraltar gates, To my own under-earth, âMy glad, great land, which at the most Knows that its fathers knew thee; so Will spend for thee nor count the cost; But follow thee? Ah, no! âThine image gently fades from earth! Thy churches are as empty shells, Dim-plaining of thy words and worth, And of thy funerals! âBut oh, upon what errand, then, Leanest thou at the sailor's ear? Hast thou yet more to say, that men Have heard not, and must hear?â OLD POURQUOI 'T was not yet night, but night was due; The earth had fallen chalky-dun; Our road dipped straight as eye could run, Between the poles, set two and two, And poplars, one and one, Then rose to where far roofs and spires Etched a vague strip of Norman sky: The sea-wind had begun to sigh From tree to tree, and up the wires Slid its frail, mounting cry. All afternoon our minds had reveled In steep, skylarking enterprise; Our hearts had climbed a dozen skies, And fifty frowning strongholds leveled Of Life's old enemies. A trifle, here and there, was spared Till morning found us more adept; But, broadly speaking, we had swept Earth of her wrongs; light had been flared Where the last Error slept! Then, nothing said and nothing seen, Misgiving gripped us. Treeless, bare, The moorland country everywhere Lay blackened; but a powdery sheen Hung tangled in the air. And Heaven knows what suspense and doubt Prowled in the dusk! A peasant's door, Where naught was visible before, Opened, and let the lamp shine out Across the crumpled moor. A stone's-throw off some drowsy sheep Took fright; across a rise of land In shadowy scamper went the band; Three bleating ewes held back to keep Their coward young in hand. And borne across the shallow vale, Along the highway from the town, A voice the distance could not drown Chanted an eerie, endless tale, Now shrill, now dropping down To querulous, questioning minor song; Now sweeping in a solemn gust, As if some great dishonoured dust Came crying its ancestral wrong, And found no listener just. And as the voice drew nearer toward, It dropped through vague disastrous bars, Heart-broken roulades, sudden jars Of discord; then superbly soared Into a heaven whose stars Twinkled to some immortal jest, And satire was the cosmic mood;â Upon which, down the twilight road, With stolid haste, monotonous zest, Shuffled or limped or strode,â Who? What? King David, crazed and free! Hamlet, grown old, and wandering! The ghost of Tiryns' murdered king Clamorous by its native sea; Or his who made to sing The Frogs, and set the Wasps to buzz Round plague-struck Athens; the mid-pain Of old LaocoÃ¶n; Paul Verlaine, In high talk with the Man of Uz Outside his prison-pane! One moment by the darkening West We saw the grand old grizzled head, The stricken face, the rolling, red, Quizzical eyeballs, the bared chest, Hairy, Homeric, spread And laboring with the grievous chant, The knotted hands raised high and wrung, As, craning through the gloom, he flung Into our teeth that iterant Enormous word he sung. Then he was gone. Slow up the hill, And faster down the other side, The wild monotonous question died; Again the sea-wind whispered shrill, As if the sea replied. I muttered, âDid you hear?â and you Nodded. In silence half a mile We stumbled onward: you meanwhile Had paper out, your pencil flew In quirk and quiddet vile. Till in disgust I seized your hand, And thundered, âScratching music, clod? Getting his tune down? Suffering God! Have you no heart to understand?â One more New-England nod, And âYes, I heard, my son, I heard. A tune fit for the mutinous dead To march to when, Prometheus-led, They storm high Heaven! As for his word, Pourquoi? was all he said!â Pourquoi? Pourquoi? Yes, that was all! Only the darkest cry that haunts The corridors of tragic chance, Couched in the sweet, satirical, Impudent tongue of France. Only the bitterest wail flung out From worlds that traffic to their mart Without a pilot or a chart; With âWhat?â the body of their doubt, And âWhy?â the quaking heart. Old bard and brother to the Sphinx! I wonder what abysmal luck Had left your face so planet-struck, And driven you on such horrid brinks To play the run-amuck. I wonder down what road to-night You shuffle; from what plunging star Your gnarled old hands uplifted are, Between moth-light and cockshut-light, Calling young hearts to war! I AM THE WOMAN I am the Woman, ark of the law and its breaker, Who chastened her step and taught her knees to be meek, Bridled and bitted her heart and humbled her cheek, Parceled her will, and cried, âTake more!â to the taker, Shunned what they told her to shun, sought what they bade her seek, Locked up her mouth from scornful speaking: now it is open to speak. I am she that is terribly fashioned, the creature Wrought in God's perilous mood, in His unsafe hour. The morning star was mute, beholding my feature, Seeing the rapture I was, the shame, and the power, Scared at my manifold meaning; he heard me call, âO fairest among ten thousand, acceptable brother!â And he answered not, for doubt; till he saw me crawl And whisper down to the secret worm, âO mother, Be not wroth in the ancient house; thy daughter forgets not at all!â I am the Woman, fleer away, Soft withdrawer back from the maddened mate, Lurer inward and down to the gates of day And crier there in the gate, âWhat shall I give for thee, wild one, say! The long, slow rapture and patient anguish of life, Or art thou minded a swifter way? Ask if thou canst, the gold, but O, if thou must, Good is the shining dross, lovely the dust! Look at me, I am the Woman, harlot and heavenly wife; Tell me thy price, be unashamed; I will assuredly pay!â I am also the Mother: of two that I bore I comfort and feed the slayer, feed and comfort the slain. Did they number my daughters and sons? I am mother of more! Many a head they marked not, here in my bosom has lain, Babbling with unborn lips in a tongue to be, Far, incredible matters, all familiar to me. Still would the man come whispering, âWife!â but many a time my breast Took him not as a husband: I soothed him and laid him to rest Even as the babe of my body, and knew him for such. My mouth is open to speak, that was dumb too much! I say to you I am the Mother; and under the sword Which flamed each way to harry us forth from the Lord, I saw Him young at the portal, weeping and staying the rod, And I, even I was His mother, and I yearned as the mother of God. I am also the Spirit. The Sisters laughed When I sat with them dumb in the portals, over my lamp,â Half asleep in the doors: for my gown was raught Off at the shoulder to shield from the wind and the rain The wick I tended against the mysterious hour When the silent City of Being should ring with song, As the Lord came in with Life to the marriage bower. âLook!â laughed the elder Sisters; and crimson with shame I hid my breast away from the rosy flame. âAh!â cried the leaning Sisters, pointing, doing me wrong; âDo you see?â laughed the wanton Sisters. âShe will get her a lover erelong!â And it was but a little while till unto my need He was given, indeed, And we walked where waxing world after world went by; And I said to my lover, âLet us begone, O, let us begone, and try Which of them all the fairest to dwell in is, Which is the place for us, our desirable clime!â But he said, âThey are only the huts and the little villages, Pleasant to go and lodge in rudely over the vintage-time!â Scornfully spake he, being unwise, Being flushed at heart because of our walking together. But I was mute with passionate prophecies; My heart went veiled and faint in the golden weather, While universe drifted by after still universe. Then I cried, âAlas, we must hasten and lodge therein, One after one, and in every star that they shed! A dark and a weary thing is come on our headâ To search obedience out in the bosom of sin, To listen deep for love when thunders the curse; For O my love, behold where the Lord hath planted In every star in the midst his dangerous Tree! Still I must pluck thereof and bring unto thee, Saying, âThe coolness for which all night we have panted; Taste of the goodly thing, I have tasted first!â Bringing us noway coolness, but burning thirst, Giving us noway peace, but implacable strife, Loosing upon us the wounding joy and the wasting sorrow of life! I am the Woman, ark of the Law and sacred arm to upbear it, Heathen trumpet to overthrow and idolatrous sword to shear it: Yea, she whose arm was round the neck of the morning star at song, Is she who kneeleth now in the dust and cries at the secret door, âOpen to me, O sleeping mother! The gate is heavy and strong. Open to me, I am come at last; be wroth with thy child no more. Let me lie down with thee there in the dark, and be slothful with thee as before!â THE DEATH OF EVE I At dawn they came to the stream Hiddekel, Old Eve and her red first-born, who was now Greyer than she, and bowed with more than years. Then Cain beneath his level palm looked hard Across the desert, and turned with outspread hand As one who says, âThou seest; we are fooled.â But Eve, with clutching fingers on his arm, And pointing eastward where the risen sun Made a low mist of light, said, âIt is there!â II For, many, many months, in the great tent Of Enoch, Eve had pined, and dared not tell Her longing: not to Irad, Enoch's son, Masterful like his father, who had held Harsh rule, and named the tent-place with his name; Not to mild Seth, given her in Abel's stead; Not unto angry Lamech, nor his wives, Usurpers of her honor in the house; Not to young Jubal, songs-man of the tribe, Who touched his harp at twilight by her door; And not to bed-rid Adam, most of all Not unto Adam. Yet at last, the spring Being at end, and evening with warm stars Falling upon them by the camel kraal, Weary with long desire she spoke to Seth, Touching her meaning faintly and far off To try him. With still scrutiny awhile He looked at her; then, lifting doubtful hands Of prayer, he led her homeward to the tent, With tremulous speech of small and week-day things. Next, as she lay by Adam before dawn, His big and wasted hand groping for hers Suddenly made her half-awakened heart Break back and back across the shadowy years To Eden, and God calling in the dew, And all that song of Paradise foredone Which Jubal made in secret, fearing her The storied mother; but in secret, too, Herself had listened, while the maids at toil Or by the well at evening sang of her Untruthful things, which, when she once had heard, Seemed truthful. Now, bowed upon Adam's breast, In the deep hush that comes before the dawn, She whispered hints and fragments of her will; And when the shaggy forehead made no sign, And the blind face searched still as quietly In the tent-roof for what, these many months, It seemed to seek for there, she held him close And poured her whole wild meaning in his ear. But as a man upon his death-bed dreams That he should know a matter, and knows it not, Nor who they are who fain would have him know, He turned to hers his dim, disastrous eyes, Wherein the knowledge of her and the long love Glimmered through veil on veil of vacancy. That evening little Jubal, coming home Singing behind his flock, saw ancient Eve Crouched by the ruined altar in the glade, The accursÃ¨d place, sown deep each early spring With stones and saltâthe Valley of the Blood; And that same night Eve fled under the stars Eastward to Nod, the land of violence, To Cain, and the strong city he had built Against all men who hunted for his soul. III She gave her message darkly in the gates, And waited trembling. At day-fall he came. She knew him not beneath his whitened hair; But when at length she knew him, and was known, The whitened hair, the bent and listening frame, The savage misery of the sidelong eyes, Fell on her heart with strangling. So it was That now for many days she held her peace, Abiding with him till he seemed again The babe she bare first in the wilderness, Her maiden fruits to Adam, the new joy The desert bloomed with, which the desert stars Whispered concerning. Yet she held her peace, Until he seemed a young man in the house, A gold frontlet of pride and a green cedar; Then, leading him apart, Eve told her wish, Not faltering now nor uttering it far off, But as a sovereign mother to her son Speaks simple destiny. He looked at her Dimly, as if he saw her not; then stooped, Sharpening his brows upon her. With a cry She laid fierce, shaken hands about his breast, Drew down his neck, and harshly from his brow Pushing the head-band and the matted locks, Baring the livid flesh with violence, She kissed him on the Sign. Cain bowed his head Upon her shoulder, saying, âI will go!â IV Now they had come to the stream Hiddekel, And passed beyond the stream. There, full in face, Where the low morning made a mist of light, The Garden and its gates lay like a flower Afloat on the still waters of the dawn. The clicking leap of bright-mailed grasshoppers, The dropping of sage-beetles from their perch On the gnawed cactus, even the pulsing drum Of blood-beats in their ears, merged suddenly Into ethereal hush. Then Cain made halt, Held her, and muttered, â'T is enough. Thou sawest! His Angel stood and threatened in the sun!â And Eve said, âYea, and though the day were set With sworded angels, thou would'st wait for me Yonder, before the gates; which, look you, child, Lie open to me as the gates to him, Thy father, when he entered in his rage, Calling thee from the dark, where of old days I kept thee folded, hidden, till he called.â So grey Cain by the unguarded portal sat, His arms crossed o'er his forehead, and his face Hid in his meagre knees; but ancient Eve Passed on into the vales of Paradise. V TrancÃ¨d in lonely radiance stood the Tree, As Eve put back the glimmering ferns and vines And crept into the place. Awhile she stooped, And as a wild thing by the drinking-pool Peers ere it drinks, she peered. Then, laughing low, Her frame of grief and body of her years She lifted proudly to its virgin height, Flung her lean arms into the pouring day, And circling with slow paces round the Tree, She sang her stifled meaning out to God. EVE'S SONG Behold, against thy will, against thy word, Against the wrath and warning of thy sword, Eve has been Eve, O Lord! A pitcher filled, she comes back from the brook, A wain she comes, laden with mellow ears; She is a roll inscribed, a prophet's book Writ strong with characters. Behold, Eve willed it so; look, if it be so, look! Early at dawn, while yet thy watchers slept, Lightly her untamed spirit over-leapt The walls where she was kept. As a young comely leopardess she stood: Her lustrous fell, her sullen grace, her fleetness, They gave her foretaste, in thy tangled wood, Of many a savage sweetness, Good to fore-gloat upon; being tasted, sweet and good. O swayer in the sunlit tops of trees, O comer up with cloud out of the seas, O laugher at thine ease Over thine everlasting dream of mirth, O lord of savage pleasures, savage pains, Knew'st Thou not Eve, who broughtest her to birth? Searcher of breast and reins, Thou should'st have searched thy Woman, the seed-pod of thine earth! Herself hath searched her softly through and through; Singing she lifts her full soul up to view; Lord, do Thou praise it, too! Look, as she turns it, how it dartles free Its gathered meanings: woman, mother, wife, Spirit that was and is and waits to be, Worm of the dust of life, Child, sisterâghostly rays! What lights are these, Lord, see! Look where Eve lifts her storied soul on high, And turns it as a ball, she knows not why, Save that she could not die Till she had shown Thee all the secret sphereâ The bright rays and the dim, and these that run Bright-darkling, making Thee to doubt and fear,â Oh, love them every one! Eve pardons Thee not one, not one, Lord; dost Thou hear? Lovely to Eve was Adam's praising breath; His face averted bitter was as death; Abel, her son, and Seth Lifted her heart to heaven, praising her; Cain with a little frown darkened the stars; And when the strings of Jubal's harp would stir, Like honey in cool jars The words he praised her with, like rain his praises were. Still, still with prayer and ecstasy she strove To be the woman they did well approve, That, narrowed to their love, She might have done with bitterness and blame; But still along the yonder edge of prayer A spirit in a fiery whirlwind cameâ Eve's spirit, wild and fairâ Crying with Eve's own voice the number of her name. Yea, turning in the whirlwind and the fire, Eve saw her own proud being all entire Made perfect by desire; And from the rounded gladness of that sphere Came bridal songs and harpings and fresh laughter; âGlory unto the faithful!â sounded clear, And then, a little after, âWhoso denyeth aught, let him depart from here!â Now, therefore, Eve, with mystic years o'er-scored, Danceth and doeth pleasure to Thee, Lord, According to the word That Thou hast spoken to her by her dream. Singing a song she dimly understands, She lifts her soul to let the splendor stream. Lord, take away thy hands! Let this beam pierce thy heart, and this most piercing beam! Far off, rebelliously, yet for thy sake, She gathered them, O Thou who lovest to break A thousand souls, and shake Their dust along the wind, but sleeplessly Searchest the Bride fulfilled in limb and feature, Ready and boon to be fulfilled of Thee, Thine ample, tameless creature,â Against thy will and word, behold, Lord, this is She! VI From carven plinth and thousand-galleried green Cedars, and all close boughs that over-tower, The shadows lengthened eastward from the gates, And still Cain hid his forehead in his knees, Nor dared to look abroad lest he might find More watchers in the portals: for he heard What seemed the rush of wings; from while to while A pallor grew and faded in his brain, As if a great light passed him near at hand. But when above the darkening desert swales The moon came, shedding white, unlikely day, Cain rose, and with his back against the stones, As a keen fighter at the desperate odds, Glared round him. Cool and silent lay the night, Empty of any foe. Then, as a man Who has a thing to do, and makes his fear An icy wind to freeze his purpose firm, He stole in through the pillars of the gate, Down aisles of shadow windowed with the moon, By meads with the still stars communicant, Past heaven-bosoming pool and poolÃ¨d stream, Until he saw, through tangled fern and vine, The Tree, where God had made its habitation: And crouched above the shape that had been Eve, With savage, listening frame and sidelong eyes, Cain waited for the coming of the dawn. THE THREE ANGELS Before my feet the curving strand Unblurs its outline from the sea, And light feels upward like a hand To find if yet creation be. Like one whose eyes in fear are furled It feels about the pallid world, And gropes and lingers anxiously. And sure at length that all is good, Upon the pavement of the deep Dawn walks with wings that burn abroad And lifted hands that seem to keep Attention till a word be said; And now day lifts above its head A harp that soon those hands will sweep. O angel day, if thou wilt sing Look hither what has fallen to usâ Me on the bright beach wandering And her within the cliff-hung house! The word thou darest not say, she says; A wilder than thy song, I raise Above the passes perilous. Last night I sat at her right hand: Though Death upon the left hand stood, Our hearts were ne'er so light and bland; As in a moonlit summer wood Friend unto happy friend we spake, As swan by swan on a windless lake We drifted down God's glassy flood. We had been sweet friends long before, But till this evening's dark mischance, Aye, never till this deep death-hour Had such a heart been ours to dance Childlike upon the hills of glee; So on those hills she played with me, Through swooning pain and ether trance. And yet had not been breathed a sound Of love, nor a thought of love been thought. With light of light her brow was wound When mutely she made question, âWhat Means this strange light about your brow?â And I made answer mute, âYou know It is the love that we have found.â Like flame afar her life did rise And from the ends of being came, Bare as at birth, without disguise, To meet my spirit's naked flame Which towered from out the primal mist To her.âHer lips lay all unkissed; We made no sign, we named no name. O angel day, O seraph bright! As thou upon the mortal deep We o'er these coasts of deathless light, With lifted wings strong silence keep. Between the plumed and whispering fires We raise on high the golden lyres Which soon our burning hands shall smite! A PRAIRIE RIDE I When I look back and say, of all our hours This one or that was best, Straightway, from north and south, from east and west, With banners strange and tributary powers The others camp against me. Thus, Now for many nights and days, The hills of memory are mutinous, Hearing me raise Above all other praise That autumn morn When league on league between ripe fields of corn, Galloping neck and neck or loitering hand in hand, We rode across the prairie land Where I was born. II I never knew how good Were those fields and happy farms, Till, leaning from her horse, she stretched her arms To greet and to receive them; nor for all My knowing, did I know her womanhood Until I saw the gesture understood, And answer made, and amity begun. On the proud fields and on her proud bent head The sunlight like a covenant did fall; Then with a gesture rich and liberal She raised her hands with laughter to the sun,â And it was done, Never in life or death to be gainsaid! And I, till then, Home-come yet alien, Held by some thwart and skeptic mind aloof From nature's dear behoof, Knelt down in heart and kissed the kindly earth, And, having swept on wings of mirth The big horizon round, I swiftly clomb, And from the utter dome Of most high morning laughed, and sang my loved one home! Meanwhile, within the rings our laughter made, Bending like a water-arum Where impetuous waters meet, Rhythmic to the strong alarum, Of her horse's rushing feet, Before me and beside me and on before me swayed Her body like a water-arum blade, Like a slanted gull for motion, And the blown corn like an ocean For its billows and their rumor, and the tassels snapping free As whittled foam and brine-scud of the sea. Thanks to God, No ocean, but the rife and homely sod, And golden corn to feed A universe at need! Land of mine, my mother's country! My heritage!âBut through her loosing hair Sha has tossed me back the dare. Drunken-hearted! shall it be a race indeed? Then drink again, and drink again, to reeling drink the winy speed! III Ye on the jealous hills, Ye shall not have your wills For many a dreaming day And haunted night. To that high morning, walled and domed with light, I am given away; And often here, above the weary feet That pour along along this fierce and jaded street, As from a taintless source Of power and grace, Anxious and shrill and sweet I hear her strong unblemished horse Neigh to the pastured mothers of the race. SONG My love is gone into the East Across the wide dawn-kindled sea; My love remembreth naught of me Nor of my lips nor of my breast, For he has gone where morning dwells Into the land of dreams and spells. But yet sometimes deep in the night A foolish little cricket thing, A kind of voice, will wake and sing And drone and sing till it is light; I am not sure, but every day I grow to think he sings this way:â âInto the West, or late or soon, Across dim seas into the West, Thy lover will sail back in quest Of Earth's one gift and life's one boon, Of simple love that comes to pass As dew falls or as springs the grass.â MUSA MERETRIX I turn the last leaf down, and lay The flaunting rubbish in the grass; With folded arms across my face I shut the summer light away. On him too the old trick to play! Too dull, too base! I see again his dream-worn hand Shaken by my poor praise, his brow Flushed by the words I scarce knew how To speak at all, so shadowy grand He stalked there in Song's lonely land, Under the vow. So rare a spirit, and if frailâ Curse thee! what should a spirit be That ate not, drank not, save for thee? Flat brothel-jestress, thing of sale, On his head too to pour the stale Indignity! THE COUNTING MAN I Eeny, meeny, miney, mo, Cracka feeny, finey, fo; Omma nooja, oppa tooja, Rick, bick, ban, do! II Eeny, meeny, miney, mo,â All the children in a row. Cracka feeny, who is he, Counting out so solemnly? III Eeny, meeny, look how tall, Like a shadow on the wall! When did he come down the street, Muffled up from head to feet? IV Listen! Don't you hear the shiny Shadow-man count meeny-miney? Hush! when all the counting's done Maybe I might be The One! V Cracka feeny, finey, fo, Watch his shining fingers go! He can see enough to play, Though he hides his face away. VI Oppa tooja, rick, bick, ban, O the solemn Counting Man! Forty-'leven from the topâ Now where will his fingers stop? VII Eeny, meeny, miney, mo, Cracka feeny, finey, fo; Omma nooja, oppa tooja, Rick, bick, ban, do! THE MOON-MOTH Again the steep path turns, and pained at heart With prescience of the beauty soon to be, Climbing I break the flowering weeds apart And the low vines that mat about my knee, Till airy-strong against the sky and sea Juts out the fragment of a temple's base And one great corner-stone. Deep, deep, within me, in some deepest place Of unknown being, laughter wakes, and moans, As on the marble ledge I lay my face, Bowed down with thoughts of Her who had this house and throne. Above the market and the popular well Within whose carven niche the old men sat To murmur at Medea, and to tell How her witch-love for Jason turned to hate, High o'er the struggles old men wonder at, High in the delicate heavens, beheld of none Save who should climb above Yonder hill-fountain where Bellerophon Snared the winged horse and backed him in the moon,â Corinth the city raised up unto Love This specular temple pure and its far-gazing grove; That in the intense zenith laughing free, Making inviolable light its screen, Passion might know a wilder secrecy, To an abandonment more wounding lean, More richly healing of a hurt more keen; That, high in prospect of all Hellene story, Love, which will gather power From all it sees of beauty and of glory, And on the top of every lifted hour Stand singing of itself as from a tower, Might stand and sing at ease from this bright promontory. Temple and grove are gone; the summit lies Bare to the feet of the fantastic year. Weeds of strange flower, and moths of many dyes, Creepers and flyers small, that, watched anear, Are as outlandish gods and things of fear Seen at their amorous revels and their warsâ These only keep the height, These and the jeweled air that laps and jars In tide and gulf-stream of ecstatic light, Through pale gold deeps, whereof no ripple mars Outspreaded Greece flame-pale and more than earthly bright. Those faint vermilion hills that southward peer Look over into Clytemnestra's land, As if each crouching summit leaned to hear White-lipped Cassandra, by Apollo banned To drink with cries of loathing from his hand Her horrid vision of the house of sin; Those heights of flame and dew, Gleaming far westward, lock Arcadia in; And where the olive-mottled gulf burns blue, The Muses' mount, with silver summits twin, Shines o'er the violet steep that Delphi clings unto. Yonder a name, yonder a name, and yonder A name to make the troubled blood beat fast And the o'ertaken spirit ache with wonder: Daphne, whose slope the spring-time revelers passed, With Eleusinian Demeter to taste The bread of resurrection; Sunion, Glad shrine and pharos glad; Hymettos and grape-dark Pentelicon; And bright, O bright against their bronzen shade, Athens, by time and ruin undismayed, Lifting her solemn crown of temples to the sun. Mountains and seas, cities and isles and capes, All frail as dream and painted like a dream, All swimming with the fairy light that drapes A bubble, when the colors curl and stream And meet and flee asunder. I could deem This earth, this air, my dizzy soul, the sky, Time, knowledge, and the gods Were lapsing, curling, streaming lazily Down a great bubble's rondure, dye on dye, To swell the perilous clinging drop that nods, Gathers, and nods, and clings, through all eternity. We cry with drowsy lips how life is strange, And shadowy hands pour for us while we speak Old bowls of slumber, that the stars may range And the gods walk unhowled-at.... To my cheek This stone feels blessÃ¨d cool. My heart could break Of its long searching and its finding not, But that it has forgot What 't was it searched, and how it failed thereof. âO soft, ye flute-players! No temple dove Be fluttered! Soft, sing soft, ye lyric girls, Till the shrine portals ope and the blue smoke outcurls! Dance slowly, singing as if Pindar heard And loved again this sweet fruit of his breast. O let the strophe, like a smooth sea-bird, Drift down the wave, and wheel again to rest One long, long instant on the glittering crest. Scare not the sacred peacock where he spreads His fan upon the wall; Let not a flower, let not a petal fall From those fresh-woven garlands on your heads; Dance delicately slow as yon light treads From isle to isle: though late, love comes at last to all! And might it not be sweeter late than soon? What though the western radiance flame and fail? What though the ivory circle of the moon Deepen to gold? What though the keen stars tell Through Heaven's abysm their midnight and all's-well, And still not yet the jealous doors unclose? Despair not; these delays We know are Paphian, and the waked thrush knows Who from the grove chants love's heart-broken praise. âToo late, too soon! Too soon, too late!â he says, âO goddess, hear them now, before the sweet night goes!â Aye, deeply heard! In Aphrodite's porch Perfect of her the slumbering lovers lie, And on the shrine steps where her saffron torch, Lights their young bosoms when they turn and sigh, And in the moonlit grove, and round the high Plinth, where her fiery urns purpureal Signal her native deep; To these she giveth all things, even sleep. But, rich, rich giver, hast thou given all? Dost thou not some diviner secret keep For me, though outland, though half-atheist in thy hall? âShattered! And I awake. The prayer was rash. Daylight is hardly touched with failure yet, Though there a glowing headland drops to ash And there a chanting island will forget Its glory soon. The stones with dew are wet. The moon sings up the worldâor in my blood Climbs it, the choiring peace? What have I done, what suffered or withstood, That all within me is so bright and good? âLook, lo, the rainbow-colored pinions please To settle! A moon-moth, by all my dreams it is! Rich as a pulse a worshiped head rests on, The glimmering vans that time the trembling life Open and close above the moon-washed stone, As if the fairy heart were fugitive, As if it halted panting from a strife Too large for its frail day. O missionary Winds of the far and dear! O elfin ship, why flap your gallants there? My heart has many a brimming estuary Where you can ease you from the endless air, The ocean light you sailed to bring me news of her! Our souls had risen from their second birth, And were at peace within the land thereof; With tears we trod there, and with careless mirth: And sometimes on the bosom of my love, Or on her lips or brow, or poised above All palpitant and doubtful on her head, A soft-winged splendor lit; And I would say, âThe Butterfly!â and sit Loving it till it went. And once I said âHush, the Moon-Moth!â That evening we were wed Anew, and we were glad as the uprisen dead. And now, what gladness ails thee now, my soul? For all the desolate, all the wasted days Nothing but strong delight? The lifted bowl, The cones of ecstasy, the wands of praise, Tossing delirious down the mountain ways Of all that's forfeit, all that is foregone? Triumphing through the seas, And past the ghostly power that, leagued with these, Did make as if the bolts of God were drawn Between her life and me? And like a fawn Thou 'lt dance there in the moon, where now the moon-moth flees? But whither, flame of pearl, vapor of pearl, Breath and decantment of sea-buried gems That with the foam-born Woman did upswirl To wreathe their brightness round her breast and limbs And give their color to the cup that dims Earth's piercing cry to music,âwhither now Do the weighed wings intend? Fawn heart of me, that with the upflung brow Followest on, where will thy dances end? O after many days! O let me bow, Let me be risen lordly up! My love, my friend, My wild one, my soul's need, my song of life! Through the strange seas and past the ghostly powers Safe come and sure, and like a festal wife, Admonished of the seasons and the hours, The time of times and the preparÃ¨d bowers! Above thy brow floats like an influence The moon-moth, our dear sign, No plainer now than when these eyes of mine In faith imagined and beheld it once, As these thy hands to all my thirsting sense, To lips and breast and brow, are palpable as then. More palpable, by that dark curtain wove And hung between us for Earth's lie of lies! Which these our meeting hands make nothing of And this thy happy bending-down denies, And these our clinging lips and closÃ¨d eyes And mating breasts have never, never known But for the cheat it was. âSigh not, love; tremble not! Be all at peace! You will not go because the moth is flown? âGone, beyond passion's cry!âThe moon-washed stone, The sleeping weeds, the stars few over dreaming Greece. And my far country swims into the light. The seaboard states are up, the prairies stay But little longer now to make them bright. Westward the burning bugles of the day Are blowing strong across America. New laws, new arts, new gods, new souls of men, New hopes and charities! Why do I traffic where no profit is, Taking but one or two where they take ten Who trade to their own shores, and back again To their own shores? O my beloved! Who replies But thou, fled heart, who cling'st here close and true! For us the future was, the past will be, And all the holy human years are new, And all are tasted of eternally, And still the eaten fruit shines on the tree. âLet us go down. There, in that naked glen, Bellerophon played the thief. Much lower lies the well where the old men Sat murmuring at Medea, and at their chief Spoused to the witch. Love, we'll not grieve again, We ne'er shall grieve again, not what we could call grief! THE FOUNTAIN Another evening falls, another leaf Drops from the withered bough. Here let us rest Till dawn, if still another dawn be ours, And these be not the limits of our hopes. This desert starlight seems to shale away The crust and rind of our disfigurement, And I can see us on the palm-fringed shore, Young, in a land of virgin miracle. With laughter and light words we burnt the ships, And waited while the morning jewel-pure Between the flaming zenith and the sea Drank up the smoke, and left all crystalline. Then, after prayer and planting of the cross, Our captain rose, and o'er us where we kneeled Let stream the ensign of our strange attempt. With shout and song we took the wilderness, Light song which in the arrogance of joy Mocked all the shadowy issues of our search. âWondrously near those first days rise to-night Bright-pictured to the visionary sense, And like a stepping music, full of gust And savorous to the marrow of the tune. But dim and without sound, a realm inert, Lie the long stretches of our after-toil. You know how hunger, accident, disease, Ambush and open battle wore us down, How schism split us, envious leadership Ditched into rivulets of little head The stream and onset of our expedition; How some for love of women, some for sloth, Some for a taint of wildness in the blood, Some brain-sick, or with dreams of savage rule, Fell off from us and mingled with the tribes. You know how, when the knighthood we were of Was broken, when despair was in the ranks, And the main voice was loud for turning back, This handful, heroes of a dwindling hope, Bade deep farewell, and set our faces on. Long, long ago the others found their kin, Wept in the shrunken bosoms of their wives, And leaned their weight of weakness on their sons, Or else, not fortunate, sank by the way, With eyes turned homeward, and delirious hands Held up through the death-mist to signal Spain. But we, who now out-tarry our own selves, Who are as our own spectres haunting us, Many a dim immemorable year We grope about, at hazard of our clue; Again and yet again the thin thread snaps, The half-heard rumor dies upon the air; Then sit we drowsed, forgetting what we seek, Again remembering only to forget, Till, in some wakeful moment such as this, Or such as come under the struggling dawn, When earth is taken with anxiety, And till the crisis all the gates of life Swing wide, and there is access everywhere And mighty recognitions, then once moreâ I know not how ye others keep the quest, I know not on what root of hope ye feed, But as for me, the voices that I hear, The beckoning hands I follow, are of them Whom you reject as false and lying guides. Again I see that dark-eyed leaf-crowned boy, That tawny budding girl, earnest and vague, Who took our meaning with soft-brightening gaze, And beckoning slipped before us through the wild; And like a fountain on the hills of dream Wells the clear music of their mated throats, Now rising from the maiden's single heart, Now from the youth's, rejoicing far away, But ever wedded in the secret depths And raining up inextricable song. âHasten, hasten, turn and twine Body mine, spirit mine, Spells behind me, Lest he follow me and find me! Never stay, but as we may Fleeing, fleeing, bar the way; To my love's delicious moan Make the air no thoroughfare, Lock the light to stone! By the heavenly pool to-day, Body mine, spirit mine, We must bathe, we must play Alone, alone!â âI knew not when I rose from thee, I only knew That on from tree to dreaming tree All the wet, dark forest through I touched and traced the fairy clew. Upland silences unstirred By wind of dawn Or wakeful bird, With signals wan and unaverred Led me, lured me, lulled me on, To where a brook or little river Bubbled from a Source divineâ O, by many a mighty sign Sealed and set apart forever Mine, mine!â Again I listened to that married pair, Who laid their hands upon the giant trees, Saying, âWhen these were seedlings, we were far Gone in the wonder and the peace of love,â Yet seemed young as the bloom they led us through. And I can hear again the husband's song At which the woman clung to him and wept, And after seemed more blessÃ¨d than before. âDost thou fear, my bride, to dwell Longer near the wondrous well, Where we, careless leaning, Drank and were glorified? Stirs and flutters in thy side, Love, the sweet meaning Why we abide, Here where the waters flow Till the heart-prophecied hour! When with tears of weakness, songs of power, We have knelt the stream beside, And poured the chrysm wild Over our deathless child, Then we will goâ O whither, whither, love, seeking our child that died!â Yea, yea, I know to what unlikely springs, To what mere household wells and neighbor brooks Some led us, saying, âHere by chance we drank And suffered the bright change; stoop ye and drink!â Also I know how others stood at loss, Saying, â'T was here, 't was such a place as this; But nowhere wells the water. Blame us not! Perhaps it has its seasons!â Seasons four We waited once, and when the fourth was run We put our guide to deathâunrighteously! For look you, but a little after that, Upon the monstrous borders of this place, We met the ancient comrades of our quest. A lifetime since, they fell away from us And mingled with the tribes. Nine souls we met, Seven thereof as old and worn as we, And with them women-kind more broken still; But two were more divine uplifted men Than when we knelt beside the burning ships. You know how, at our question, one spake naught, But wept, and gave us mutely of his store, Filling our hands with precious necessaries; The other, from our vasty mountain shelf, Pointed far westward over silver peaks. Then she who went beside him as his bride Smiled and said Nay to the uplifted arm; Yet followed where he led us. Twelve days march By west and north we journeyed, through a world Gigantic and phantasmal, as if flung In terror of their fancy from the hands Of rude and early gods. And as we went, Ever before us that bright woman sang Many a bright, disturbing song, whereof One was the strangest among many strange. âI saw a thousand gates unclose, A risen woman in each gate; Each woman cried, âFor thee I rose: Waitest thou? I can wait!â âI scared the stars above the sun, I shook the old roots of the sea, The anchored continents did shun My importunity. âI cried, âI will not suffer death, Nor shameful age, the death in life! What from our love God hidden hath Be wrung from Him with strife!â âIn faintness once again I lay, And saw those gates unclose about me, I heard the thousand women say âHow long, then, wilt thou doubt me? ââFor thee, I rose, for thee I wait Who am thyself, long, long uprisen; Come to the Fountain; it is late; And darker grows thy prison!â âAll mutinous thoughts away I flung, And I, a risen woman, trod Those liberties where gushed and sung The living wells of God.â So, for twelve days, her singing led us on: The twelfth day, in the fading light, we came Into a region where the laboring earth Spouted whale-like her fountains, icy some And clear as ice, some boiling sulphurous. Then, by the master-water in the midst, He who far off had pointed out the land Halted us, saying, âHere I drank; drink ye!â And when we drank and found no virtue in it, He muttered, âEven as the other seven!â And beckoning his bright woman, slipped away. But he, our other comrade, who had wept To see us, and had followed without speech, Broke silence then, and as the mountain dusk Shut over them, we heard his lessening song Mix with the pouring waters and the wind. âNot with searching, not with strife, Not by traveler's true reporting, Nor by signs of old importing, Win ye to the Fount of Life. But as the husband to the wife At evening thoughtless goes, And lo, about her careless head Twines terror like a flashing knife, Breathes wonder like a climbing rose, And dreams wherewith his youth was rife, The sorrowed-for, the long-since dead, He finds up-gathered in her eyes Beyond belief, beyond surpriseâ So shall ye find, not otherwise! For ere with striving you are come The fountain's singing heart is dumb, Faded its spell; And down the world at random hurled By conduits and thwart understreams, The secret waters of the wellâ Where the thirsty millions dwell Or 'neath unvisited moonbeamsâ Renew their miracle!â To-morrow morn, yet fewer than to-night, We will go on, leaving the fallen head. These peaceful desert men will give it honor. From moon to moon they hold us more in awe, And as they deal with their outlying gods,â Them of the farther fields and water-holes, Too shy to climb into their rock-perched towns So do they unto us, in lonely places Setting us sacred food, honey and maize, Sun-baken fruits and sacrificial bread. I think there have been battles waged for us, And vigil set in all their eagle-towers; I think their priests come with us afar off, Staying when we stay, moving when we move: Either 't is so, or 't is a thing I dream. Though order and the comeliness of truth No more reign constant in the spirit's house, Though far and near shift places, and our sleep Tangles itself with what we are awake, Yet, O worn brothers, much-enduring men, Without search, without striving, go we on, For I am told at heart that we shall find! ... Perhaps within the pictured water-jars They fill and place for us along our path; Perhaps in stooping where the wild and tame Fight for the thread of moisture in the rocks; Perhaps as ghosts beside the ghostly lakes Which noonday paints upon the distant sand; Perhaps far sunken by a canyon pool, Under the soft rein of a cataract Which leaps and scatters down the walls of Death. THAMMUZ Daughters, daughters, do ye grieve? Crimson dark the freshes flow! Were ye violent at eve? Crimson stains where the rushes grow! What is this that I must know? Mourners by the dark red waters, Met ye Thammuz at his play? Was your mood upon you, daughters? Had ye drunken? O how grey Looks your hair in the rising day! Mourners, mourn not overmuch That ye slew your lovely one. Such ye are; and be ye such! Lift your heads; the waters run Ruby bright in the climbing sun. Raven hair and hair of gold, Look who bendeth over you! This is not the shepherd old; This is Thammuz, whom ye slew, Radiant Thammuz, risen anew!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">POETIC DRAMAS THE FIRE-BRINGER And when Zeus determined to destroy the men of the brazen age, Deukalion, being forewarned by Prometheus, built a boat, and putting into it food and drink, embarked with Pyrrha. Zeus sent a great rain from heaven, so that all men were overwhelmed, except a few who fled to the high places. Deukalion was driven upon the darkness of the waters until he came to Parnassus; and there, when the rains had abated, he landed and made sacrifice, praying for men to repeople the earth. Then Deukalion and Pyrrha took stones, and threw them over their heads; those which Deukalion threw became men, and those which Pyrrha threw became women. ... Also Prometheus gave to them fire, bringing it secretly in a fennel stalk. When Zeus learned of this, he commanded HephÃ¦stos to bind the body of Prometheus upon Mount Caucasus; and for the theft of fire Prometheus suffered this punishment.â Apollodorus. The Fire-Bringer is intended as the first member of a trilogy on the Promethean theme, of which The Masque of Judgment is the second member; but the connection between the present poem and the one which follows it in the dramatic sequence is informal, and the action of each is complete in itself. DRAMATIS PERSONÃ Prometheus Pandora Deukalion Pyrrha Ãolus Lykophon Alcyone Rhodope The Stone Men The Earth Women A Priest of Zeus Various persons, survivors of Deukalion's flood. ACT I Darkness covers the scene. Faintly discernible, a mountain slope, backed by low cliffs, and beyond these the upper stretches of the mountain. In the cliffs a small cave, and before the mouth of the cave a rude altar or earth. Deukalion and Pyrrha are seated against the cliff; Ãolus lies on his face at their feet. Deukalion. Thou hast slept long. Pyrrha. I saw a burning lamp That passed between the levret and the dove On Zeus's altar, and a smoke went up. Deukalion. Dreams: we are old. The green heart and the sear He feeds with dreams; having some purpose in it, Or else His idleness. Pyrrha. No lamp was here? No fire, no light? Deukalion. Some fire-sparks in the eyes Of dull bewildered beasts that came to gaze, And dully moved again into the mist. They have forgot their natures, even as we, And those who tremble yonder on the heights For fear the ebbing deep should mount again, Breathing this darkness have forgot ourselves, Our natures, and the motions of our souls. Pyrrha. Was not the Titan here? Seemed as he stood, Behind him dawn, and in his lifted handâ Deukalion. He came, in darkness. Pyrrha. What word should he bring? Deukalion. I feigned to sleep. I had no heart for speech. Pyrrha. What did he, being with us? Deukalion. Stood awhile Watching thy slumber; touched the sleeping head Of Ãolus; gazed upward to the heights; Then vanished down the slope: and far below Pandora sang. Pyrrha. Again?â Deukalion. I say below I heard her once, and once upon the peaks. A little after, thunder tore the sky, And 't was as if, far off, unearthly steeds And cloudy chariots plunged across the dark. Hush fell; and, wailing like a broken bird, I heard her dropping down from rock to rock. Then for an endless season sat she here, Her head between her knees, and all her hair Spread like a night-pool in the autumn woods. Pause. Pyrrha. Since the loosed raven flew, nor came again, And since the black wind ceasing cast us here, How long should the time be? Deukalion. A week, a month, Measureless years, some moments. Time is dead, Drowned in the waste of waters; or it lies Somewhere abolished in the primal mud, Caught in the rings of Python, whom at dusk Of that last day, peering in terror forth Before we shut the windows of our boat, We heard hiss from the north and from the south, And from the east and west, and saw him lay His circles round the frothy rim of the world; Or fled above the dark, Time softly there Laughs through the abyss of radiance with the gods. Pyrrha. Think'st thou the gods laugh, now the colored world They sought to when the spring was on the hills, And had their stolen loves here, lies snuffed out, A reeking lamp? Deukalion. Also therefore they laugh: And therefore also do we bow us down In fear and worship. Pyrrha. Aye, so.âWhat sayest thou? Deukalion. I say supernal laughter and smooth days Fill up Heaven's golden room. For that the earth Hath her dim sorrow and her shrouded face, Should the gods grieve? Pyrrha. Husband, these breasts are dry That fed our many sons; that head of thine Is hoar with majesty of years and rule; Much have I learned of thee and stored at heart Concerning gods and men, the elder age Of golden peace, the silver time between, When lust and strife began to gnaw the world, And these wild latter days. In the ark also, Crouching in darkness, and upon this mount Of weary darkness, hast thou held a torch To light my mind to patience of these woes Through understanding. Yet, behold, O king, I understand not! Wherefore hath great Zeus, Thy likeness in the heavens, bound like thee To shepherd his wide people, sent his floods To whelm them up, shut from the remnant clans Sun, moon, and stars; and for a final curse Drawn from the flints and dry boughs of the pine The seed of divine fire,âyea, from our blood, Yea, from the secret places of our frames Sucked up the fire of passion and of will, And left us here by the desolate black ebb To rot and crumble with the crumbling world? Wherefore is this, O king? Deukalion. Thyself hast said. Pyrrha. Yet know not.âHeavy of thought! Make me to know. Deukalion. Because these latter days are full of pride And lust and wrangling; because his skies were vexed With the might of rearing horses, and the wheels Of chariots, and the young men blowing horns Against his citadel; because the south In all its chambers laughed a grievous red Out of the vineyards of its wantonness; Because our fitful pulses, when they fell, Sang grief, division, terror, shame, and loss, Troubling that harmony which is the breath Of the gods' nostrils, yea the delicate tune To which they pace their souls, and act with joy Their several ministries. Pyrrha. Why then so long Do these flat slugs, that once were statured men, Cling to the oozy earth-rind He would cleanse For some new perfect race? Why, when thou heard'st Prometheus whisper thee his fearful news That evening by the farm-gate, did'st thou grant No sleep to slave or free, till from the hills The mighty pines were dragged, the hull-beams laid, The roof-tree raised, the doors and windows set, And through the muttering thunder all thy house Led in to safety? When the holy fire, Brought by thine own hands from the hearth, went out, Why did'st thou bare thy white head to the storm To fetch another brand, and, finding none, Come forth with lamentation? Why were seen, Through all thy mountain kingdom, runners stripped, And panted words, and flying to the peaks? Thou answerest not; but leaning darkly down Over the head of little Ãolus, Fingerest a tarnished lock from out the dust! Speak, father! Through this numbing gloom, this death, This veil of years, thy silence pierceth me. Deukalion. I try to feel again the thing I felt, But cannot, so the sinews of my soul Are loosened. Yet 't was for this radiant head That all was done defiantly toward God. His father Hellen and our other sons Were wandering, or had poured their lifeblood out In obscure battle. This alone was left, This little flower of Greece, for whom I dreamed Kingdoms and glories, plaudits, trophies, palms, And sound of deathless lyres across the world. For his sake, fumbling in the gloom I built This altar, and have groped about the rocks For live thing worthy sacrifice; have lain In bush and hollow till some dreaming bird Or sleep-besotted beast fell to my hands, And rent the same, and offered it with groans Upon the smokeless altar. Pyrrha. Once He heard, Thou knowest. Deukalion. I know. We will not think thereon! Pyrrha. The unwrought shapes, the unmoulded attitudes! The tongues of earth, the stony craving eyes! Deukalion. Unto the husband was the wife's desire No longer, nor the husband's to the wife. The young maid lay undreamed on by the boy. The little life that was, was sinking fast Or sunk beyond recall. God's doubtful voice Out of the wind of the oak was fair to hear, Seeming to promise store of goodly men, And women vessels for the flowing life To enter and be spilled not. There was hope. Prometheus said not nay. Beside the verge Of the spent flood did we not see him stoop, Kneading the clay in with the roilÃ¨d foam, Breathing and breathing with his fiery breath, Then cry upon his work, and scattering it Rise up in haste and wrath? Yet here was hope! Pyrrha. Yea, as I flung the clods, and stooped and flung, I dared not look behind, for hope; and thou, Stooping and flinging the allotted stones, Seemed clothed in prime of years, foreseeing earth With a big breed replenished; till on a sudden Terribly out of the gloom the Titan cried; Then we, ceasing, beheld, and fled in fear. Deukalion. Would they might sit as now, removed apart, Brooding upon the ground; nor come again With vague slow motion up the shrouded slope, Filling the mist with formless utterance, As craving to be born! My men of stone In dreams appal me with their lifted hands Of threat and supplication, and by thee Stand the earth-women pleading. Pyrrha. Ere I slept I was anhungered. Searching for sweet roots I crawled and groped my way, till I was come Unto a brackish water cupped and held From that same sea whereof the gurge but then Lessened its roar far down the craggÃ¨d dark. There by the pool they sat, with faces lift And brows of harsh attention; in their midst Pandora bowed, and sang a doubtful song, Its meaning faint or none, but mingled up Of all that nests and housekeeps in the heart, Or puts out in lone passion toward the vast And cannot choose but go. Deukalion. In mockery sent, In mercy be she taken, or on the hills Drinking this darkness, wither and be changed To such as we are! Pyrrha. Thinkest thou that Zeus In anger made her thus? Deukalion. 'T will be so. When she came Our minds were dim and fearful. Pyrrha. Very dim, And blurred with fearful dream; butâBy the boat We crouched, and hearkened if the water still Drew downward, or was crawling up again To seize us unaware; the mist was full Of beasts and men in wretched fellowship; Then suddenly a breath like morning blew; I saw as 't were a shadowy sun and moon Go up the blinded sky; far off yet near I heard Prometheus speaking, and her voice In low and happy answer. Deukalion. He would catch The hurlÃ¨d thunder-bolt, and forge from it A reaper's hook; the vials of white wrath He spills to make a wine-cup for a feast; Curses he knows not from the gifts of love; And in the shadow of this death, even here, As low as from her pitch of pride earth's fallen, He will be plotting that whereby to climb And lift us high above the peaks of God One dizzy instant, ere we fall indeed And he with us forever! Pandora. Sings, below. Along the earth and up the sky The Fowler spreads his net: O soul, what pinions wild and shy Are on thy shoulders set? What wings of longing undeterred Are native to thee, spirit bird? Pyrrha. Hearken, is 't not Her song again? Far down among the vales Did'st hear it? Faint and far, butâHearken still! Pandora. Sings. What sky is thine behind the sky, For refuge and for ecstasy? Of all thy heavens of clear delight Why is each heaven twain, O soul! that when the lure is cast Before thy heedless flight, And thou art snared and taken fast Within one sky of light, Behold, the net is empty, the cast is vain, And from thy circling in the other sky the lyric laughters rain! Deukalion. Through the gorge thereâa shadowâPyrrha, look! Over the torrent bed and up the slope Something comes on, in stature more than man, And swifter. Pyrrha. O swift-comer, it is thou! None other, thou, wind-ranger, bringer-in! Child, be awake! Prometheus! Prometheus. Entering, lifts Pyrrha. Do not so; These hands come poor; these feet bring nothing back. Pyrrha. Thy hands come filled with thee, thy feet from thence Have brought thee hither; it is gifts enough. Deukalion. Is there no hope? Pyrrha. Speak! speak! Through this dark cloud The eyes of Zeus's eagle cannot pierce Or any listener heed. Have we a hope? Prometheus. From earth and all this lower realm of air The fire is gone. Pyrrha. Thy searchings!âGiveth ease If but to hear thy voice. Prometheus. Seats himself beside the cliff. I clambered down Old earthquake-cloven rifts and monstrous chasms Where long ago the stripling Titans peered At play and dared not venture,âfound me out Flint-stones so buried in disastrous rock I thought the Darkener sure had passed them by; But not a spark lived in them. Past the walls Rhipean, and the Arimaspian caves, I sought the far hyperborean day, But not a banner of their rustling light Flapped through the sagging sky, nor did the Fates Once fling their gleaming shuttles east or west. By Indian Nysa and the Edonian fount Of HÃ¦mus long I lurked, in hope to find Young Dionysus as he raced along And wrest his pine-torch from him, or to snare Some god-distracted dancing Ã¦gipan, And from his garland crush a wine of fire To light the passion of the world again And fill man's veins with music; but there went A voice of sighing through the ghostly woods, And up the mountain pastures in the mist Desolate creatures sorrowed for the god. Across the quenched Ãgean, where of old The shining islands sang their stasimon, Forever chorusing great hymns of light Round Delos, through the driving dark I steered To seek HephÃ¦stos on his Lemnian mount; But found him not. His porches were o'erthrown, His altar out, and round his faded peak The toilÃ¨d Cyclops, bowing huge and dim, Uncouthly mourned. ... He starts up, and gazes toward the mountain-top. Soon will the smouldering life Cease even to smoulder! I must forth again. But where? But where? Pause. Deukalion. Where suppliants still must go, But with the act of suppliance, and the mind. Not stiff and rebel brows, not daring deeds Be of availment, but to clasp the knees And touch the beard of Zeus. Within his house Still lives the sacred fire. 'T is there to have, If one by sacrifice and rites full-brought Could find the way. Prometheus. Laughs. 'T is there to have; thou sayst! One thistledown of fortune to the good And 't had been ravished thence, an hour ago, To better uses! Deukalion. 'T was but so long since The thunder spake. Across the vault of heaven Plunged down the shadowy furnishment of war. Pyrrha. Thou'rt wounded! Lo, this arm hangs helpless by!â O, rash and overbold! Thouâthou hast daredâ The hermÃ¦ holding vigil at Heaven's bound Have cried thy name out, and the shadows vast Of perished gods, beside the inmost hearth, Have spoken of thee, that the soul of Zeus Hath shook with dreams of evil to his house! Deukalion. How might'st thou pass the terror of his ward, Tread his serenest citadel, and come Not thunder-blasted hither, with slight wound? Prometheus. Flings himself again upon the ground. When each great cycle of Olympian years Rounds to its end, there comes upon the gods Mysterious compulsion. As a gem Borne from a lighted chamber into dusk, Heaven of its splendor disarrays itself, Hushes its dyes, and all the whispering sphere Hangs like a moon of change. Knowing not why, Nor unto what, each brooding deity Wends to the sacred old Uranian field, Where bloom old flowers, which, in the morn of time, Forgotten gods did garland for their hair, To celebrate some long-forgotten joy That then did pierce the heart of the young world. Here gather they, with mute and doubtful looks At one another, waiting till She comes, Mnemosyne, mother of thought and tears, Remembrancer, and bringer out of death Burden of longing and sweet-fruited song. Then toward the upper windows of the stars, The roof and dome of things, the place supreme Of speculation inward on the frame Of life create, and outward on the abyss That moans and welters in the wind of love, She leadeth up their shining theory, And there they stand and wonder on the time When they were not and when they shall not be. This was my moment; for I knew 't was near, And laired away among the steep-up crags That bastion and shore-fast his pearl of power, His white acropolis. Soft as light I passed The perilous gates that are acquainted forth, The walls of starry safety and alarm, The pillars and the awful roofs of song, The stairs and colonnades whose marble work Is spirit, and the joinings spirit also,â And from the well-brink of his central court Dipped vital fire of fire, flooding my vase, Glutting it arm-deep in the keen element. Then backward swifter than the osprey dips Down the green slide of the sea, tillâFool, O fool! 'T was in my hands! 'T was next my bosom! Fierce Sang the bright essence past my scorching cheek, Blown up and backward as I dropped and skimmed The glacier-drifts, cataracts, wild moraines, And walls of frightful plunge. Upon the shore Of this our night-bound wretched earth I paused, Lifted on high the triumph of my hands, And flung back words and laughter. As I dropped, The dogs of thunder chased me at the heels, A white tongue shook against me in the dark, And lo, my vase was rended in my hands, And all the precious substance that it held Spread, faded, and was gone,âwas quenched, was gone! Pause. Deukalion. In a low voice. We cannot thank thee, though thy love be love. Great is thy heart; we cannot praise thy deed. Prometheus. It was not therefore done! Pyrrha. For our poor praise, For our poor love and praise; albeit now The shouting of thy loud blood drowneth all! Deukalion. After a long silence. Prometheus, thou hast thought to be our friend, Our blood-kin, our indweller; hast indued Vesture of our mortality and pain,â Wherefore if not for pride, for fiercest pride? Thou hast found out wild pathways for our treading, Whispered us Nature's secrets, given to our hand The spirit of fire and all its restless works, Yea, blown aflame our all too eager blood Till earth went red and reeling like a torch When Dionysus calls under the moon. Look round thee, O storm-sower, what we reap Now in the season's fullness! Is it good? Pride was thy lesson, and earth learned so well That she is fallen more low than she was high. Prometheus. And shall be higher than that height she was, By all this depth she has fallen! Deukalion. In that day Let Chronos lift his old abolished head From mid Lethean mallows, and dim-tongued Call to thy shadowy brothers where they dream, And leading up his faint forgetful host, Rive the great diadem from Zeus's brow. Then may thy stormy will at last be thine; But as for now, even for thy earth's dear sake, Be humble, O be humble! Bind thy hair With willow, and put on the iron ring, That so, by walking fearfully at last, We bend Heaven from its anger. Else shall man Suffer such woes as now we muse not of, And thou such punishment as quails the heart To think on. Prometheus. Either now with violent hand We snatch salvation home, or here we sit Till Python, hissing softly up the dark, Dizzy our lapsÃ¨d souls, and headlong down We drop into his jaws, which from the firstâ See, the boy wakes! Ãolus. Waking. Give me to eat and drink. Pyrrha. Water and roots I hoarded in the cave. I will go fetch them forth. She goes into the cave. Deukalion. Was 't well with thee In slumber, child? Ãolus. I know not. I did sleep. Pyrrha. Coming out. The roots are gnawed, and the sweet water spilled. Be patient, Ãolus, I will seek thee more. Deukalion. Stay; let me fetch them rather. Thou wilt fall, Or meet some fear. The sluggish serpents lie And will not move, though trodden, save to sting. Pyrrha. Thou knowest not where the roots are still to find. Deukalion. Rising painfully. Together then. Ah, me! Where is thy hand? Pyrrha. Here, father. No, this way! They go slowly out, feeling along the cliff. Prometheus. Poor poisoned flower, Poor droop-head, down again! Stoops over Ãolus. Woe for the house, Woe for the vineyard, woe for the orchard croft, The oil-tree and the place of standing corn! Woe for the ships of venture! Woe on Him Who sows and will not gather; shame and woe Who sendeth forth and when the message comes Makes deaf and strange! He sinks down beside the cliff. O Mother Clymene, What of the song-thrush and the morning star, The moon deep-hung with increase down the dawn, The wet fields brightening fast, the hour thy pangs Came on thee for my sake? What of the earth Thou loved'st so well and taught'st me well to love? âHears not! 'T was long ago. His head falls upon his knees. One deep, deep hour! To drop ten thousand fathoms softly down Below the lowest heaving of life's sea, Till memory, sentience, will, are all annulled, And the wild eyes of the must-be-answered Sphinx, Couchant at dusk upon the spirit's moor, Blocking at noon the highway of the soul, At morn and night a spectre in her gates,â For once, for one deep hourâ He lifts his head slowly, and peers into the darkness. Say who ye are That fill the night with deeper heaviness! Break up your strangling circle and come out. More, more, and wretcheder! A spirit pass Into some old and unachievÃ¨d world, A storm-fall in some wood of rooted souls! But O, what spirit-piercing flower of life Blooms from the wasteful heap? From among the crouching figures of the Stone Men and Earth Women, Pandora's voice is heard. Pandora. Sings. Of wounds and sore defeat I made my battle stay; WingÃ¨d sandals for my feet I wove of my delay; Of weariness and fear, I made my shouting spear; Of loss, and doubt, and dread, And swift oncoming doom I made a helmet for my head And a floating plume. From the shutting mist of death, From the failure of the breath, I made a battle-horn to blow Across the vales of overthrow. O hearken, love, the battle-horn! The triumph clear, the silver scorn! O hearken where the echoes bring, Down the grey disastrous morn, Laughter and rallying! Prometheus. Thou! Is it thou? Pandora. Comes from among the recumbent figures, holding something aloft. Where is Prometheus? Prometheus. I am I, thou knowest. Pandora. I had a gift for him. Where is he gone? Prometheus. Give me thy gift. 'T will bring Prometheus back To the high home and fortress of his soul, Where thou and he made gladness. She gives him a fennel stalk. What is this? Pandora. A hollow reed. I found it on the hills. Prometheus. Such used the mothers in the upland farms Fetch unpolluted fire in, once a year, To light their hearths anew; such would the girls Crown with fir-cone and smilax when they heard The frenzied pipe call in the midnight hills, And whisperings of anguish dimmed their blood. Pandora. Such had Prometheus, were he here again, Wreathed for his listening earth; such had he filled With unpolluted fire, and kindled new The hearth-cheer of the world. Prometheus. Earth, sea, and air, The caverned clouds, the chambers of the storm, Yea, the thrice perilous alps and crags of Heaven Have watched the robber lurk, and laughed at him! Do not thou mock him too! Pandora. Him I will mock Who, being thirsty, climbs not to the spring, But meanly drinks at rillet and low pool, And thirsteth still the more. Prometheus. The spring? The spring? He hesitates, then starts up with a wild gesture. I could have done it once! I could have done it! Pandora. Coming nearer. Stranger! Prometheus. Hush, look! They rise at me again! The Stone Men. When earth did heave as the sea, at the lifting up of the hills, One said, âYe shall wake and be; fear not, ye shall have your wills.â We waited patient and dumb; and ere we thought to have heard, One said to us, âStay!â and âCome!ââa dim and a mumbled word. Mortise us into the wall again, or lift us up that we look therefrom! The Earth Women. The night, the rain, and the dew from of old had lain with us, The suns and winds were our lovers too, and our husbands bounteous: But lo, we were sick at heart when we leaned from the towers of the pine, We yearned and thirsted apart in the crimson globes of the vine. O tell us of them that hew the tree, bring us to them that drink the wine! They disappear. Prometheus. Only a moment did they strain their brows In weary question at me, ere they turned And melted down into the blotting dark! He starts slowly down the slope. Pandora. They go to find Prometheus. Prometheus. Of these stones To build my rumoring city, basÃ¨d deep On elemental silence; in this earth To plant my cool vine and my shady tree Whose roots shall feed upon the central fire! He turns to Pandora. Love! Pandora. Where thou goest, I am; there, even now I stand and cry thee to me. Prometheus. Starts again down the slope. Yea, I come, I come; to find somewhere through the piled gloom A mountain path to unimagined day, Build all this anger into walls of war Not dreamed of, dung and fatten with this death New fields of pleasant life, and make them teem Strange corn, miraculous wine! Pandora. Watching him disappear. Prometheus, lord! ACT II Scene as before. The space below the cliffs is deserted; on the slope above, voices of men and women are heard. First Voice. Peer farther down! Hear'st thou the waters yet? Second Voice. With sea-slime and with lichen-tangled shells The rocks are strewn, and ocean-breathing things Gasp in the shallow pools; but the main flood Is sunken further than the ear can hark. They descend. A Young Man's Voice. Above. A little strength, sister, a little strength! Nay, then, I die with thee. An Old Man's Voice. My son, my son, Where art thou? Answer me! Another Voice. Peace. He is dead. I saw him sink upon the farther slope. Back to him, if thou wilt; thou'lt come too late. Chorus of Men. The fallen must lie where they fell, For the dead cannot succor the dead. Chorus of Women. O when through the valleys of hell Shall the light of our Saviour be shed? They descend. Others appear from above. First Voice. Above. Trust not the sea! Look where the frothing lip Curls off the giant fang! Back to the heights! Second Voice. Nay, fallen are the waters. It is past. Third Voice. The life we hurled from off the temple crag With supplications and with piercing song, Has made thus much appeasement. One more life Will roll away the ocean of main dark; Unless we be forever doomed to lie As now, blind bulks of sleep, or hunger-bitten To creep the stagnant bottom of the world. Fourth Voice. This way, 't is said, Deukalion carried him. Follow on, yonder, where the cliff breaks down. They descend; others follow. From the side, below the cliffs, a muttering group presses in; in their midst are Deukalion and Pyrrha, who shield Ãolus against the cliff. The space about the altar is filled with indistinct figures. Deukalion. I am king, hear ye, am I not the king? Higher than I is none. Take me! Why him, Little of strength and wisdom? I am wise, My cunning brain is stronger than a host. Though this my spear-arm be a little fallen From when it led you out against the north, I am more terrible and mighty now, An old, much-seeing spirit. In my death The gods will taste a pleasure and be soothed. But from this child, this playmateâlook ye hereâ This piece of summer's carelessness, this tuft Of hyssop planted by the wells of glee,â What honor should the dread gods have on him? They shall have me, Deukalionâ A Man's Voice. Bring not on us With wordy shifts, the last steep horror down! That is no babe thy withered arm hides there. We know him; we have seen. If he might live His name would fill the future, and make big The story of his folk. He is our best, Our soul of price, and him the gods demand, Together with the maid, whose father hereâ O how much more a kinglier will than thou!â Deukalion. Where art thou, Lykophon? Mine eyes are dim. Lykophon. Here by the altar. Deukalion. And thy child? Lykophon. Here too. Deukalion. Thy heart is firm to do it? Thou wilt live, And think on t' after? Ay, remember that! Hast weighed that with the rest? Lykophon. He was my slave, Whose crazed old voice cried yonder of his son. Was it to win a remnant of dim days, A handful of poor mealtimes and to-beds, He offered him? To watch some mornings rise, Some evenings fall, fringing with fearful light The cliff he hurled him from to the hungry sea? Am I a lesser than my bondman is? Deukalion. Yea, ye will teach me, and I'll bear it tame! I know what fits a king, what he must pay In peace of soul and heart's blood for his folk. King-drownling of an island of drowned dogs, Wolves, snakes, and field-rats, crept from out the flood For hunger and the hell-bred fog to rot! Rot ye! I'll keep my own. Lykophon. To the crowd. Back, back, I say! The gods despise enforcÃ¨d offerings. When the heart brings its dearest and its last Then only will they hearâif then, if then! Deukalion. Be this life taken, what is left? O friends, O wretched children, lift your hearts and eyes, Look through the death-dark hither and be known On what you ask; think on yourselves, on me, On them that keep the heights, and who lie strewn Along the downward path. See how the price Doth shame the purchase! A Man's Voice. We have thought on these, And find they are our brothers and our friends, Our parents, children, wives; and that they die. Lykophon. Not they alone. The past, the future dies. A Woman's Voice. Hark what he says! He knows not, yet he says! None of you know. I have cried unto you And told you of it, but you will not know! You will not listen what I carry here Under my heart, and feed and shelter now, That then shall be the bread and wine of the world, The torch and sword and lyre, the water-brook, The lion-gate and wall of many towers, The marshaler of dances,âthere, O there Beyond the shadow and the sorrow, far In God's new garden, his green virgin mount! Chorus of Women. Would, would we might be silent, for we know Though now He puts us by, Though now He heeds us not nor hearkeneth, The groping of our anguish up the sky Will wean and wear Him so That in the vexÃ¨d sendings of his breath He will breathe out a deeper than the gloom Of our deep doom, And put in death a sting sharper than death. Distant thunder. Chorus of Men. Seize them and stifle up their irking lips! He grudgeth at us, but forgetteth where He felt our spreaded palms, and was aware Of fierce and tedious prayer. Yonder of us night darkens with his frown; Far off, and all forgetfully He drips His drowsy anger down. The thunder rolls nearer, and terrific storm sweeps over the scene. A Woman's Voice. Ah, no, He smiteth us! His lightning leaps From end to end of the world! A Man's Voice. His thunder shakes The pillars of the dark. Lo, up above The roof of darkness ruins and lets in Thrice horrible night! Another Voice. Alas, the wind, the wind! The trampling and the bellowing herds of rain Loose on the mountain slopes! Bow down! Bow down! Deukalion. Gropes forward through the tempest and lifts Ãolus upon the altar. Lord, stretch thy hand and take him! He is thine. Lykophon. What criest thou, Deukalion? Deukalion. Take the child. The gods' dark will be done! I am content. He falls. Lykophon. Bending over him. Deukalion! Pyrrha. Husband! Father! Speak, look up! Lykophon. Rising. The king is down. Here in his mighty room I stand up over you! Where is the priest Who serves the altar on God's mountain top? A Man's Voice. Yonder he crouches, and his sacred eyes Are set athwart; he wanders in his wit. Lykophon. Prepare him for his ministry....And thou, Alcyone, sweet head! Thou keepsake life Left me for memory, thou precious seal Stamped with her mystic love-sign unto me, I put her blessing on thee; and do thou Kiss me, and put her blessing upon me For this I do. He lifts her upon the altar. Weep not.âRoom for the priest! The priest advances, holding the sacrificial knife. Pyrrha. Flings herself before the altar. Hold off your hands, hold off! The king is fallen, And falling spake somewhat. But I, who drank Of his deep will, who ever was and am His heart's high furtherer, cry over him Ye shall not touch them yet! Not yet ye shall! Not till Prometheus comes or makes a sign! Lykophon. Thou see'st the grey eternities of time That we have waited, till our minds are crazed With watching, and our all o'er-hearkened ears Hear silence roar and mutter like a sea; And still he comes not, and no word comes past The crouching places and close lairs of death. A Man's Voice. Yet he will come: his haughty soul shall not Be hindered of its walk. Priest. Behind the wall A thief was taken, and his sons at dawn Said, âNow he comes with purchase; we will feast,ââ Even while the ravens on his glazing eyes Were feasted, and the master of the house Said, âI have judged him and forgotten him.â Ye blind and credulous, ye whispering things! Mutterers, collusioners! What wait we for? Chorus of Women. O that our spirits might not thus Afflict us, making pictures on the dark, And giving silence tongues to cry against us! For though we shut our ears and will not hark, And blind our eyes from seeing, he is there; The dust of heavenly battle dims his hair, The large gods close about him, he is down; Now thrice three times about the shining town The thunder-wingÃ¨d chariot drags his corse; And now they bind him to the wingÃ¨d horse With chains of burning light; the portent rears away O'er prairies of insufferable day! Chorus of Men. 'Twixt Berenice's tangled hair And that blue region of the morning where The bright wind-shaken Lyre Sheds down the dawn its spilth of silver fire, We saw him stoop and run upon the air, Shielding from region gusts the stolen flame; But from a steep cloud warping up the west A curse of lightning came. With tort-flung neck and clutchÃ¨d breast He fell, a ruined star; And now the char Had quenched itself with hissing, in the sea, But lo, again his soul flamed gloriously! The eagle tempest, gyring from its place, Seized him, and whirled, And hung him on the plunging prow of the world, To shed the anguish of his face Upon the reefs and shoals of space, To lighten with the splendor of his pain Earth's pathway through the main, Though death was all her freightage, and the breath That swelled her sails was death. A Man's Voice. He will not come. I heard an old bard once Sing of him, saying Titan Iapetos Fathered him not; his mother Clymene, Wandering in the morning of the world, Suffered human embraces. 'T will be so, For he is human-minded, and too slight To wrest from God's hand the withholden fire. Second Voice. Hearken! One sings upon the upper slopes. Third Voice. 'T is she, the other gift in mockery sent, Pandora. Fourth Voice. Haunting, cruel to the heart. She opens sunny doors, which ere we look Are closed foreverlasting, and their place Not to be guessed. Fifth Voice. This was another thing Prometheus did. Whom the gods sent in wrath To make us know how wondrous was the life That inchmeal they took from us, even her He chose out for his love, and even here He made his bridals. Sixth Voice. Some say 't is not so, But she Pandora is a child he had Before the sea rose and the night came down, And others say his sister, whom he fetched From Hades, where she was with Clymene, Being childed late, after the Titans fell. A Woman's Voice. Hush, hark, the pouring music! Never yet The pools below the waterfalls, thy pools, Thy dark pools, O my heartâ! A Young Man's Voice. Delirious breast! She jetteth gladness as a sacred bird, That o'er the springtime waves, at large of dawn, Off Delos, to the wakening Cyclades Declares Apollo. A Girl's Voice. Once more, once more, O sisters, ere we die I will lift up my cry To Him who loved us though He puts us by. For yonder singer with the golden mouth Hath fallen upon us privily as falls The still spring out of the south On the shut passes and locked mountain walls, And suddenly from out my frozen heart Dark buds of sorrow start, Freshets of thought through my faint being roll, And dim remembrance gropes and travails in my soul. I will cry on Him piercingly By reason of my girlhood how it ailed, Then when I seemed Unto myself a thing myself had dreamed, And for whose sake the visionary Spring High in the chilly meadows where she stood With lips of passionate listening In the sea-wind above the moaning wood, Scattered her discrowned hair, and bowed herself, and wailed. And then, a little after, came a day That loosed my bands of ailing all away; For somewhere in the wilds a spirit spoke, The ghostly earth went past me like a stream, And swooning suddenly aloft I woke To an intenser dream. Would mine were that same spirit's tongue to tell The joy that then befell,â Rather befell not, but refrained, Lurked and withdrew, And was an inner freshness in the dew, A look inscrutable the stars put on, A fount of secret color in the dawn, After day-fall a daylight that remained Brighter than what was gone. O sisters, kiss the numbing death away From off my heavy lips, and let me say How fair my summoned spirit blossomed in its clay, When the girls sang of me that I was his Whose voice I heard treading the wilderness; And I had followed him as the homing dove That furtive way he went, Till now he had brought me up into his tent, Where flutes made mention of love, and wild throats said With wine and honey of love were his tables spread, Also the banner over us was love! Pause. A Woman's Voice. Look, Pandora comes! See, there above the cliff she glimmers down, And darker shapes come with her. A Man's Voice. The big seed Deukalion and Pyrrha sowed in hope To reap in terror; the scarce-featured sons Of stone, and daughters of the sullen glebe. Deukalion. Waking. Pyrrha! Where art thou? Pyrrha. 'T is my face thou feelest, Thy groping hands are even on me, father. Deukalion. Who are these? How is 't with us? O wherefore Gaze ye all thus aloft? Pyrrha. Pandora comes. Deukalion. I see naught. Since a little while mine eyes And brain are faded. Help mine eyes to see. Pyrrha. She pauses on the margin of the cliff. About her are the shapes of them who rose Behind us, when we sowed the heavy seed. Her either hand is on a kneeling head, Female and male; her forehead more than theirs Is lifted up in yearning, and her face Is like the lyrist's when at first he waits And drifts his heart up through the cloudy strings. A Man's Voice. Take heed there to the lad, where he hath risen His height upon the altar! And the maid Is risen. Look to them! Pyrrha. Children! Ãolus! What is 't with you? What search ye in the heavens? O, to what high thing do your spirits strain And your hands tremble up? Ãolus and Alcyone. Looking and pointing upward. The stars! The stars! Pause. Deukalion. Why hath so deep a hush fallen on the night? I heard a whispering cry. What whisper they? Pyrrha. Ãolus pointedâwhispering of the stars. Deukalion. Ãolusâstars. Pyrrha! Pyrrha. With thee! Deukalion. Spakest thou Of stars? Pyrrha. Ay, so he whispered! Deukalion. Thouâand thou? Pyrrha. Nothing, nothing. My soul was as a lake Spread out in utter darkness; to its depth There pierced a silvery tremblingâ Deukalion. Look again. Wife, cease to pray! Look out again! Pyrrha. The dark Gathers and flees, and the wide roof of night Leans in as it would break; the mountainous gloom Unmoors, and streameth on us like a sea. O Earth, lift up thy gates! It is the stars! It is the stars! It is the ancient stars! It is the young and everlasting stars! Pandora. Sings. Because one creature of his breath Sang loud into the face of death, Because one child of his despair Could strangely hope and wildly dare, The Spirit comes to the Bride again, And breathes at her door the name of the child; âThis is the son that ye bore me! When Shall we kiss, and be reconciled?â Furtive, dumb, in the tardy stone, With gropings sweet in the patient sod, In the roots of the pine, in the crumbled cone, With cries of haste in the willow-rod,â By pools where the hyla swells his throat And the partridge drums to his crouching mate, Where the moorland stag and the mountain goat Strictly seek to the ones that wait,â In seas aswing on the coral bar, In feasting depths of the evening star, In the dust where the mourner bows his head, In the blood of the living, the bones of the dead,â Wounded with love in breast and side, The Spirit goes in to the Bride! Pyrrha. The veil that hid the holy sky is rent; The vapors ravel down; and a bright wind Blows, that the planets and the shoalÃ¨d worlds Stoop from their dance, and wheel and shout again, Scattering influence as a mÃ¦nad shakes Pine sparks and moon-dew from her whirling hair. And hark, below, the many-voicÃ¨d earth, The chanting of the old religious trees, Rustle of far-off waters, woven sounds Of small and multitudinous lives awake, Peopling the grasses and the pools with joy, Uttering their meaning to the mystic night! A Man's Voice. Within my soul there is a rushing down Like darkness, and my being, as a heaven, Soareth apparent, as a heaven with stars. A heaven hung with stars my spirit is, And all among them walks a wind of will, Uttering life, and purpose, and desire! A Woman's Voice. O for the dreaming herbs, the whispering trees, And rustling, far-off waters of my heart! O for the mystic night risen within me! The multitudinous life, the busy sounds Of woven love, the hushed and pouring love, The pouring love and stillness of the night! Deukalion. Wife, wife, what falleth since? Pyrrha. A stir of joy Troubles the fields of air 'twixt star and star. Across the quivering acres, by and large, An unimaginable Reaper goes, And where he walks the heavens are seldom-sown; Till o'er wan earth the spreaded heavens are bare, Save for one mighty star that gathers light And stands like a flushed singer telling glory. Now he, now even he has no dominion, For he has looked behind him to the mountains, O, he has looked up to the lovely mountains Of the unimagined morning, and has hearkened The pouring of the chill, eternal urns! Over the solemn world grey habitation Wonders at habitation. Room by room, The heavens tremble and put on delight, Ignorant one to another why it is The festal wish compels them. They are brightened Under the feet of many breathless spirits, Who, lifting up their hands by the springs of ocean, Cried âPÃ¦an!â and âO, Hymen!â As a stream Silvereth in a wind-start, heaven is brightened Under the speed and striving of those spirits,â Who now, even now dissolve, and leave behind them Only their gladness and their speed; for now Through all its height and frame of living light, Through all its clear creation, breathing depths And fleeing distances, the sacred sky Pulses and is astonished like a heart; It looketh inward and bethinks itself, Outward, and putteth all its question by, To shine and soar and sing and be at one!â Nearhand the slopes drink light, and far about Among the mountain places, headlands, cliffs, Lone peaks, and brotherhoods of battlement Shout, having apprehended.âPaler grow The gulfs of shadowy air that brim the vales; As ocean bateth in her thousand firths, The grey and silver air draws down the land. The little trees that climb among the rocks As high as they can live, pierce with their spires The shoaling mist, swim softly into light, And stand apparent, shapely, every one A dream of divine life, a miracle. Chasms are cloven in the violet And amethystine waters of the air; Forests and winding rivers of the plain Are given and withdrawn; a moment since I saw, I thought I saw a strength of hill Uplifted far below us, built upon With what was once a lordly place of souls, A carved and marble place of puissant souls, Builded to such strong music that the sea Had hardly heaved one lintel from its post, Or marred one face of all the sculptured men, Or shaken from his seat one musing god.â Again the air is cloven; I have seen Fane-crownÃ¨d promontories, curving sweeps Of silver shore, islands, and straits, and bays; And bright beyond, the myriad ocean stream. And O, beyondâbeyond!âO shelter me! Bow down! Cover your eyes! Confused Voices. Terrible wings!â Light awfuller than darkness or the sea!â O spirit of sharp flame amid the burning! A Boy's Voice. My hands are on my eyelids, and my knees Shelter my face. O mother, lay thy breast About me, and shut out the killing light, Before my eyeballs and my brain be dead! Deukalion. On his knees, with outstretched hands. Of late mine eyes were quenched, and now I see. Pyrrha. Thine eyelids are not open, but thy face Searcheth into the radiance. Father, cease! Look not upon it with thy soul. Thy face Is terrible with beauty in the light. I cannot look upon thy seeing face. Take not the mortal glory on thy face! Bow downâO let me shield thy sightless eyes! Deukalion. Burning is laid unto the roots of the world; The deep spouts conflagration from her springs; And fire feeds on the air that feeds the stars. Out of the sea has burst, from rended deeps Of the unthought-on rearward has leapt out The appearance of the glory of the sun, Filling the one side of the roaring world With creatures and with branch-work of pale fire; And through the woods of fire the beasts of fire, The birds and serpents and the naked souls Flee, that their fleeing startles the slow dead Through all their patient kingdoms, and the gods In their faint spheres are flown and passionate. A Man's Voice. My soul is among lions. God, my God, Thou see'st my quivering spirit what it is! O lay not life upon it! We not knew The thing we asked for. We had all forgot How cruel was thy splendor in the house Of sense, how awful in the house of thought, How far unbearable in the wild house That thou hast cast and builded for the heart! Lykophon. Deukalion, speak again! Pyrrha. If yet thy flesh Endure to look upon it, speak again. Deukalion. His soul is strong and will deliver him! The feature of his anguish and his joy Makes dim the light adjacent, and his soul Is bright to overcome. He treads the glory Over against the roaring, hitherward. Seeing the taper of small excellent light He lifteth in his hand, the night rolls on Before him, and day follows after him. The hours, the months, the seasons, and the times Acknowledge him; the waste calls to the sown; The islands and hoar places of the sea Sing, as the chief of them that are taught praises. About his torch shineth a dust of souls, Daughters and sons, who fly into the light With trembling, and emerge with prophecy; And round about goeth a wind of tongues, A wind as of the travailing of the nations; Vast sorrow, and the cry of desperate lives To God, and God to them crying or answering.â Child! Ãolus! My child. Where is my child? Pyrrha. I cannot see; the dazzle of his coming Makes blind the place. Here, father, in thy knees! Feel, 't is the darling head! Wild comer, when? Hasten, have pity, we are nothing strong! Father, how is 't with thee? Why bow'st thou down? Thy hand is cold, thy lips are very cold.â O gone, O gone, even at the entering-in! A Voice. Who are these coming down, that they are mighty To walk with foreheads forward to the light, Singing the mortal radiance to its face? A Voice. It is Pandora and the unborn men, Deukalion's seed. She doth it of her power, They of their weakness. Pandora. Sings, invisible in the light. Ye who from the stone and clay Unto godhood grope your way, Hastening up the morning see Yonder One in trinity! The Earth Women. Save us, flaming Three! Pandora. Dionysus hath the wine, Eros hath the rose divine, Lord Apollo hath the lyre: Three and one is the soul's desire. The Stone Men. Save us, sons of fire! A Woman's Voice. Listen, they have passed. They go with singing forward down the light. Prometheus. Below, invisible. Thou gavest me the vessel; it is filled. Pandora. I am the vessel, and with thee 't is filled. Pause. Lykophon. Whispers. Pyrrha! Pyrrha. Who whispers me? Lykophon. Is he not come? Is he not busied by the altar there? Pyrrha. NayâLo, the terrible taper! It is he! I see him not; my spirit seeth him; My heart acheth upon him busied there. âDeukalion, O Deukalion! Prometheus. From the altar. Pyrrha! Pyrrha! Pyrrha. Prometheus, saviour! Prometheus. Lykophon! Lykophon. Lo, me! Prometheus. Bring me your children hither. Pyrrha and Lykophon. Groping forward with Ãolus and Alcyone. Here are they! Prometheus. Unto this twain, man-child and woman-child, I give the passion of this element; This seed of longing, substance of this love; This power, this purity, this annihilation. Let their hands light the altar of the world. 'T is yours forever. I have brought it home! The radiant mist fades; it is clear day, flooded with morning sunlight. The children apply the burning reed to the fuel, and fire flames high upon the altar. Pandora's voice is heard faintly, far below. Pandora. Too far, too far, though hidden in thine arms; Too darkly far, though lips on lips are laid! Love, love, I am afraid; I know not where to find thee in these storms That dashed thy changÃ¨d breast my breast upon, Here in the estranging dawn. Unsteadfast! who didst call and hast not stayed. Tryst-breaker! I have heard Thy voice in the green wood, and not deferred:â O fold me closer, fugitive one, and say where thou art gone! Nay, speak not, strive not, sorrow not at all! O, dim and gradual!â BelovÃ¨d, my belovÃ¨d, shall it be? Keep me, keep me with thy kiss, Save me with thy deep embrace; For down the gulfs of spirit space, The slow, the implacable winds, now unescapably Wheel us downward to our bliss, Whelm us, darken usâO lethal winds!âdown to our destined place. Swimming faint, beneath, afarâ O lover, let there be No haste, nor clamor of thy heart to see! But I have seen, and I whisper thee How the rivers of peace apparent are, And the city of bridal peace Waits, and wavers, and hardly is, Fades, and is folded away from sight; And now like a lily it openeth wistfully, Whispering through its courts of light âHow long shall we be denied? How long must the eastern gate stand wide, Ere these who are called shalt enter in, and the bridegroom be with the bride?â ACT III An open rocky place higher in the mountains; in the rock-wall at one side is a rough-hewn open tomb; in the rear the stranded ark of Deukalion, caught amid great rocks, is outlined against snow-peaks and against a vast sunset cloud, full of shifting light. The funeral train of Deukalion winds up the steep path from below. Lykophon and a company of grown men carry the bier, beside which walk Pyrrha and Ãolus. Chorus of Old Men. In one same breath Uttering life and death, Whatso his mouth seems darkly to ordain The darkling signal of his hand makes vain, And like a heart confused He sayeth and gainsaith. With himself He wrestles thus Or gives this wrestling unto us. Whichever, it is well. O children, we are risen out of hell, And it is pleasant evening! Daughters, sing! Upon his way let soft and golden mirth Be spoken round the king, And unto heaven be told the sweetness of the earth. Chorus of Girls. How shall the thought of our hearts be said, Here, where this averted head Lonely walks by the lonely dead? 'T were better others sang, Not we, not we! For when the mighty morning sprang Terrible in gladness from the sea, When, entering the high places of the air, Noontide unbelievably Possessed them, and lifted up his trophy there,â Yea, all the noon and all the afternoon, We could have put our secret by, we could have spoken Well before thee, O mourner, O heart broken! But now, but nowâMother, mother, We have seen one coming with thee up the steep; His mild great wing we saw him keep Over thee like a sheltering arm, And the shadow of one pinion fell across To shield the bosom of thy lord from harm; We have seen him, the dark peace-giver, Thanatos;â But O, we have seen also another, Winged like him, and dazzling dim, He came up out of the sun, yet he goeth not down therewith; For, ever warmer, closer, as the evening falleth pale, His arm is over our necks, and his breath Searches whispering under our hair; and his burning whisper saith A thing that maketh the heart to cease and the limbs to fail, And the hands to grope for they know not what; We would not find what he whispers of, and we die if we find it not! Chorus of Young Women. Ere our mothers gave us birth, Or in the morning of the earth The high gods walked with the daughters and found them fair, Ere ever the hills were piled or the seas were spread, His arm was over our necks, my sisters, his breath was under our hair! Their spirits withered and died who then Found not the thing that his whisper said, But we are the living, the chosen of life, who found it and found it again. Where, walking secret in the flame, Unbearably the Titan came, Eros, Eros, yet we knew thee, Yet we saw and cried unto thee! Where thy face amid exceeding day more excellently shone There our still hearts laughed upon thee, thou divine despaired-of one! Though o'er and o'er our eyes and ears the heavy hair was wound, Yet we saw thee, yet we heard thy pinions beat! Though our fore-arms hid our faces and our brows were on the ground, Yet, O Eros, we declare That with flutes and timbrels meet, Whirling garments, drunken feet, With tears and throes our souls arose and danced before thee there! They place the body in the hewn vault of the rock. Pyrrha. Go down now. I and Ãolus will watch Till dawn, when ye will come to shut the tomb And sing him to his peace. Lykophon. Some few with thee Will hold the watch, for safety. Pyrrha. None. Alone. The others go down the path, leaving Pyrrha and Ãolus seated by the tomb; a girl lingers behind, and when the last figure has disappeared, throws herself at Pyrrha's feet. Rhodope. See, it is Rhodope, thy handmaiden! Behold, thou knowest. He loved her. She would stay. Pyrrha. Touching her head. Thy heart shall take no fear. O, stay with us! The voices of the young men are heard, descending. Chorus of Young Men. When, to the king's unveilÃ¨d eyes The rended deeps and the rended skies Seemed as a burning wood,â Iacchos! Iacchos! When flame took hold of the place of the dead, And burning seized on the throne of God, And birds and beasts and the souls of men As a wind of burning fled,â Iacchos! Yea, in the blinding radiance when The Bringer of Light by the altar stood, Iacchos! Iacchos! EvoÃ«! We saw thee, we knew thee, we cried upon thee! We had lost thee and had thee again! Plucker of the tragic fruit, Eater of the frantic root, Shaker of the cones of raving, sounder of the panic flute Over man and brute, Iacchos! Hunter in the burning wood, Planter of the mystic vine, From the spirit and the blood Crusher of the awful wine, Iacchos! EvoÃ«! Iacchos! The voice dies away in the distance. Silence. Ãolus. Whispers to Rhodope. See'st thou? The cloud! Touching Pyrrha. Mother, what means the cloud? Pyrrha. Raising her head. How, child? Ãolus. The cloud. See how it lives within! Pyrrha. 'T will rain; he brought us back the blessÃ¨d rain, And storm, and natural darkness, with the light. Bows her head again. As also to our hearts the shutting-in Of rain and natural darkness. Rhodope. Looking up from Pyrrha's knees. All the hours Since long ago at dawn, the livelong hours Of glory, since he brought the morning back, The cloud has piled itself, and wondrous lights Have been thus restless in it. Ãolus. Where is he? Pyrrha. I know not, child. It may be that he sleeps, Being weary; or he wanders with his love To gaze upon the gladness of the world. Rhodope. No one has seen him since he fetched the light. They say of himâI heard the old men sayâ Pyrrha. The sun goes down: we will be silent now. Silence. Ãolus and Rhodope, leaning together, fall asleep. Pyrrha kneels by the tomb, with hands stretched aloft upon the king's breast. Pyrrha. Speaks low. Thou whom my glad heart once deliberately Chose, and this morning suddenly with tears Chose, and was chosen, and was made thine at last In the destroying lightâDeukalion, lord, The day is past, the evening cometh on. Once more to thy full-wishing lips I hold The chalice of my heart up, husband! husband! For night begins to pour her voices out, And thou art stayed for on the voiceless hills. She lifts her head and listens. In the distance Pandora's voice is heard, sharp and agonized. Pyrrha. For thee too, then! Even also for thee He smote the rock; thy spirit thirsted too Afar there in the desert of thy joy, And came and drank against the morning ray Waters of trembling. By the pools in haste Thy soul stooped, plucking herb and flower of pain That groweth newly there, by the new stream! Rhodope. Runs with Ãolus, and crouches beside Pyrrha. Pyrrha! Mother Pyrrha! Look, alas, Lo, how it comes upon us! The bird! The bird! Pyrrha. Whatâwhere? How suddenly has darkness fallen, And now as suddenly 't is light again! How terribly the lion thunder roared Leaping along the mountains to the sea! âWhat saw ye? What went by us in the wind? Rhodope. Look where the giant wings rock down the slope! Pyrrha. Gazing below. God's bird of wrath! Swift is thy wrath, O God, Strong is thy jealousy! Rhodope. Awhile I slept; Then as I looked and wondered at the cloud, The restless lights flushed angry, and all the west Shone stormy bright with ridges of blown fire. The cloud flamed like a peak of the fiery isles, Where in the western seas HephÃ¦stos toils. Then from yon cloven valley in the midst Came forth the wings and shadow of the bird, And grew towards us vaster than storm, more swift Than I could cry upon him, and passed down. Once o'er the plain and o'er the ocean straits, And twice o'er the old olives by the stream Where the folk rest to-night, his shadow wheeled, And now he towers straight upward like a smoke, High, high, into the evening. Pandora's cry is heard again; she appears in the rocks above the tomb, gazing upward. After a moment she comes down and kneels beside Pyrrha, hiding her face against the rocks. Pause. Pyrrha. In a low voice, gazing at the cloud. Deemest thou That he will yield himself unmurmuring up, Or will he make wild war along the peaks? Prometheus enters swiftly from below, and raises Pandora. They stand clasped in each other's arms beside Pyrrha, who, still kneeling, draws herself up to gaze into the king's face, then clasps Ãolus with one arm and with the other the knees of Prometheus. Pyrrha. Leave us not yet, before another dawn Comes, bringing surety! For the giant dark, Seeing thee absent, may arise again, And Python lift unnameably his head In hell, hearing the gods hiss him awake. Prometheus. Be comforted; it is established sure. Light shall arise from light, day follow day, Season meet season, with all lovely signs And portents of the year. These shall not fail; From their appointed dance no star shall swerve, Nor mar one accent of one whirling strophe Of that unfathomed chorus that they sing Within the porch and laughing house of Life, Which Time and Space and Change, bright caryatids, Do meanwhile pillar up. These shall not fail; But O, these were the least I brought you home! The sun whose rising and whose going down Are joy and grief and wonder in the heart; The moon whose tides are passion, thought, and will; The signs and portents of the spirit year,â For these, if you would keep them, you must strive Morning and night against the jealous gods With anger, and with laughter, and with love; And no man hath them till he brings them down With love, and rage, and laughter from the heavens,â Himself the heavens, himself the scornful gods, The sun, the sun-thief, and the flaming reed That kindles new the beauty of the world. He draws Ãolus and Rhodope to him. For you the moon stilly imagineth Her loiterings and her soft vicissitudes; For you the Pleiades are seven, and one Wanders invisible because of you; For you the snake is burnished in the spring, The flower has plots touching its marriage time, The queen-bee from her wassailed lords soars high And high and high into the nuptial blue, Till only one heroic lover now Flies with her, and her royal wish is prone To the elected one, whose dizzy heart Presageth him of ecstasy and death. For you the sea has rivers in the midst, And fathomless abysses where it breeds Fantastic life; and each its tiniest drop Flung from the fisher's oar-blade in the sun Has rivers, abysses, and fantastic life. For your sakes it was spoken of the soul That it shall be a sea whereon the moon Has might, and the four winds shall walk upon it,â Also it has great rivers in the midst, Uncharted islands that no sailor sees, And fathomless abysses where it breeds Mysterious life; yea, each its tiniest drop Flung from the fisher's oar-blade in the sun Has rivers, tempests, and eternal tides, Untouched-at isles, horizons never hailed, And fathomless abysses where it breeds Incredible life, without astonishment. He bends over Deukalion. O death, majestic mood! Transfigured brow And eyes heavy with vision, since the time They saw creation sitting like a sphinx, Woman and lion, riddling of herself At twilight, in the place of parted soulsâ He pauses, looks at the lighted cloud, and below at the darkening earth, where a mist is beginning to rise. As far as being goes out past the stars Into unthinkable distance, and as far As being inward goes unthinkably, Traveling the atom to its fleeing core, Through world in world, heaven beneath wheeling heaven, Firmament under firmament, without end,â To-day there is rejoicing, and the folk, Though ignorant, call us blessÃ¨d in their hearts. Yea, He who is the Life of all this life, Death of this death and Riser from this death, Calleth us blessÃ¨d in his heart of hearts; And once again, in the dim end of things, When the sun sickens, and the heaven of heavens Flames as a frosty leaf unto the fall, In swoon and anguish shall his stormÃ¨d heart Cry unto us; his cry is ringing there In the sun's core! I heard it when I stood Where all things past and present and to come Ray out in fiery patterns, fading, changing, Forevermore unfaded and unchanged. Ãolus. Behold, alas, mother, look up! O haste, let us be hidden in the rocks! Pyrrha. The wings that were a little cloud in heaven Shed doom over the third part of the north; And now he slants enormous down the west Toward his throne and eyrie in the cloud. In the background, about the ark of Deukalion, the figures of the Stone Men and Earth Women emerge, and stand darkly outlined against the sunset cloud. Prometheus speaks low to Pandora, who falls at his feet. Pandora. I would be there with thee, love. O, not here! Prometheus. Stooping over her. There where I go thou art; there, even now Thou cried'st me to thee, and I come, I come. He lays her in Pyrrha's arms, and disappears in the rocks; he emerges on a higher level behind, and turns westward. Pausing beside the ark. O rude and dazÃ¨d spirits! Ye shall grope And wonder toward a knowledge and a grace That now we dream not of; then loneliness Shall flee away, and enmity no more Be spectral in the houses and the streets Where walk your primal hearts in the large light That floods the after-earth. He raises his arms over them. Out of these stones I build my rumoring city, basÃ¨d deep On elemental silence; in this soil I plant my cool vine and my shady tree, Whose roots shall feed upon the central fire! He crosses a rocky stretch leading to the western heights over which the cloud rests, and disappears in a mist-filled pass. Ãolus and Rhodope creep closer to Pyrrha and Pandora, sheltering themselves from the chill of the rising mist, which slowly covers the scene. There is a long silence, broken by faint peals of thunder. Ãolus. Whispers. Mother, the mist was grey and thick to breathe But now; and now 't is thin, and flushes red As if all round the forests were aflame. Rhodope. Whispers. Hush! See'st thou not it is the mighty cloud, That flames more fiery when the thunder speaks? Heavy thunder; Pandora starts wildly up. Pyrrha. Drawing her down. Thou spirit bird, that sangest all night long And mad'st sweet utterance from the secret shade Where his wild heart spread coolness in the sun, For thee to flit and sing,âO look not out! Still hide thee in my breast! Pandora sinks back. Pyrrha whispers to Rhodope. Rise thou, and look! Rhodope. Rises and speaks in a low voice. Over against the region where he went Thunder has torn the curtain of the mist, And out of moving darkness soars the cloud Like as a shadowed ruby, but above Like as an opal and a sardine stone Sun-touched to the panting heart; and in the midst Are shapes throned on the moving of the lights, Who ride the wrathful lights, and are the lights. Up through the driving fringes of the mist Battle a living splendor and a gloom. O, while the shapes gather and wait at gaze, That pharos of our peril in the straits, That treader of the cups of gladness out In the sun's vineyard for usâMother! Mother! Look hither, look at last, for it is time. Up through the crud and substance of the cloud Prometheus wrestles with the bird of God! Pyrrha rises, lifting Pandora. Ãolus. Look how the sudden wind has quenched the cloud, And them that were therein; and how its blowing Shoulders the mist away from the keen stars That rushed out at the fading of the lights! Look you, the cloud comes on us in the wind! It tramples down the mountains, and above Reaches abroad in darkness, blotting out Place upon place of stars. Rhodope. The smoky air Climbs up and eddies round us and falls down, Rolling and spreading wider than the world! As the cloud advances, Pandora goes toward it with outstretched hands, and pauses beside the prow of the ark, among the Stone Men and Earth Women, while deeper and deeper darkness drifts over the scene. The voices of Pyrrha and Pandora are heard as from the midst of the cloud. Pyrrha. Vast sorrow, and the voice of broken souls; A cry as of all kinds and generations, Times, places, and tongues; or as a mother Heareth her unborn child crying for birth. Pandora. Sings. A thousand Ã¦ons, nailed in pain On the blown world's plunging prow, That seeks across the eternal main,â Down whatever storms we drift, What disastrous headlands lift, Festal lips, triumphant brow, Light us with thy joy, as now! Pyrrha. A sound of calling and of answering; Answer or watch-cry of all desperate lives To God, and God to them calling or answering. The Stone Men and Earth Women sing, their voices growing fainter as they descend the valley behind. The Stone Men and Earth Women. We have heard the valleys groan With one voice and manifold; Stone is crying unto stone, Mould is whispering unto mould. The Stone Men. Hear them whisper, hear them call, âAll for one, and one for all, Dig the well and raise the wall.â The Earth Women. âFor the nations to be born, Root away the bitter thorn, Reap and sow the golden corn.â Rhodope. To Pyrrha. Hear'st thou this yet that thou didst whisper of, Or is all silence now even to thee? Pyrrha does not answer. Pandora's voice is heard, also from the valley behind, but more distant. Pandora. Sings. I stood within the heart of God; It seemed a place that I had known: (I was blood-sister to the clod, Blood-brother to the stone.) I found my love and labor there, My house, my raiment, meat and wine, My ancient rage, my old despair,â Yea, all things that were mine. Rhodope. To Ãolus. Doth not the cloud go by us? Yonder, see, A star looks dimly through. And there, and there 'T is all awake with stars! Pandora. Sings. I saw the spring and summer pass, The trees grow bare, and winter come; All was the same as once it was Upon my hills at home. Then suddenly in my own heart I felt God walk and gaze about; He spoke; his words seemed held apart With gladness and with doubt. âHere is my meat and wine,â He said, âMy love, my toil, my ancient care; Here is my cloak, my book, my bed, And here my old despair. âHere are my seasons: winter, spring, Summer the same, and autumn spills The fruits I look for; everything As on my heavenly hills. Rhodope. How swiftly now, As if it had a meaning in its haste, The cloud-bank fades and dwindles in the north! Starlight and silence. After a time, dawn begins to break in the east. Pyrrha rises and kneels again by the tomb. As the light increases, Ãolus and Rhodope climb higher among the rocks and watch for the rising of the sun. Below, the voices of the young men are heard. Chorus of Young Men. Ascending. One large last star, not yet persuaded well, Expected till the mountains should declare; But from his hesitant attitude, From his wild and waiting mood, Wildly, waitingly there came Over sea and earth and air And on our bended hearts there fell Trembling and expectation of thy name, Apollo! Now the East to the West has flung Sudden hands aloft, and sung Thy titles, and thy certain coming-on; Wheeling ever to the right hand, wheeling ever to the dawn, The South has danced before the North, And the text of her talking feet is the news of thy going forth, Apollo! Apollo! Apollo! When radiance hid the Titan's face And all was blind in the altar place, Then we knew thee, O we cried upon thee then, Apollo! Apollo! Past thee Dionysus swept, The wings of Eros stirred and slept, And we knew not the mist of thy song from the mist of the fire, As out of the core of the light thy lyre laughed and thundered again! Eros, how sweet Is the cup of thy drunkenness! Dionysus, how our feet Hasten to the burning cup Thou liftest up! But O how sweetest and how most burning it is To drink of the wine of thy lightsome chalices, Apollo! Apollo! To-day We say we will follow thee and put all others away. For thou alone, O thou alone art he Who settest the prisoned spirit free, And sometimes leadest the rapt soul on Where never mortal thought has gone; Till by the ultimate stream Of vision and of dream She stands With startled eyes and outstretched hands, Looking where other suns rise over other lands, And rends the lonely skies with her prophetic scream. THE MASQUE OF JUDGMENT PRELUDE The action falls immediately before the Incarnation. PERSONS OF THE PRELUDE Raphael Uriel The Angel of the Pale Horse A Shepherd A Shepherd Boy A Young Man (persona muta) A Girl SCENE I A meadow and coppice near the sea; beyond low hills the roofs of a town. Dawn. Raphael. Another night like this would change my blood To human: the soft tumult of the sea Under the moon, the panting of the stars, The notes of querulous love from pool and clod, In earth and air the dreamy under-hum Of hived hearts swarming,âsuch another night Would quite unsphere me from my angelhood! Thrice have I touched my lute's least human strings And hushed their throbbing, hearing how they spake Sheer earthly, they that once so heavenly sang Above the pure unclouded psalmody. Sing as thou wilt, then, since thou needs must sing! For ever song grows dearer as I walk These evenings of large sunset, these dumb noons Vastly suspended, these enormous nights Through which earth heaves her bulk toward the dawn. With song I shelter me, who else were left Defenseless amid God's infinitudes, Bruised by the unshod trample of his hours. He sings. The late moon would not stay, The stars grow far and few; Into her house of day Hung with Sidonian blue Stealeth the earth, as a mÃ¦nad girl Steals to her home when the orgies are o'er That startled the glens and the sleeping shore, And up from the passionate deeps of night Into the shallows and straits of light Softly the forests whirl. Laugh, earth! For thy feigning-face is wise; There is naught so clear as thy morning eyes; And the sun thy lord is an easy lord! What should they be to him,â Thine hours of dance in the woodland dim, The brandished torch and the shouted word, The flight, the struggle, the honeyed swoon 'Neath the wild, wild lips of the moon? Beyond the seaward screen of hazel boughs The waves flash argent 'neath the clambering light; But wherefore do these wondrous colors run Out of the place of morning? The young leaves Are swept and winnowed upward as a flame, And in their whispering glories swiftly dawns A shape of lordly wings, each plume distinct With dyes auroral. Where, 'mid store of light, Most spiritual silver burns, a face comes through. My comrade Uriel cometh from the sun! Uriel. Appearing. Why tarriest on thine errand, Raphael? Raphael. I do no errand here. Uriel. Why camest thou then? Raphael. Since earth is dear to me. Sometimes it seemsâ Treading the prairie's autumn sibilance, Or when the tongues of summer lightning speak In the corners of the cloudâI could forget My station 'mid the deathless hierarchies, And change into a clot of anxious clay. Uriel. Mock not, sweet brother! thou who knowest wellâ Better than I or Michael or the restâ The throes that shake these clots of passionate clay; Knowest their lewd harsh blood, their shell of sense So frail, so piteously contrived for pain. Raphael. I dare to say how little jest it was. Oft, as I leave these sliding shafts of dark, And homeward climb the immaterial cliffs, My heart makes question which were worthier state For a free soul to choose,âangelic calm, Angelic vision, ebbless, increscent, Or earth-life with its reachings and recoils, Its lewd harsh blood so swift to change and flower At the least touch of love, its shell of sense So subtly made to minister them delight, So frail, so piteously contrived for pain. Uriel. Brother, thou dost not well to wander here. If thou wilt roam, choose some less troubled star. The roaring midst of the insatiate sun Where God has set my watch, is peace to this! Of all the bitter drops that dewed His brow In his old agony, this earth-drop fell Most bitter salt, and ever since hath been Fuller of travailing than other worlds. Raphael. Thy speech is dark. I understand it not. Uriel. Of a dark thing I speak a few dark words. Put from thy gaze the sweet bloom of these hills And all this gorgeous dapple of the sea, And let thy memory stand again with me On Time's untrodden threshold, that first day Which searched and stung our immemorial peace With pangs of vernal influence. Heaven rose As if from sleep, and, lo, through all the void Clambered and curled creation like a vine, Hanging the dark with clusters of young bloom. Then from the viewless ever-folded heart Of the mystic Rose, stole breath and pulse of change, Delicious pantings such as seize the breast Of lovers when the love-tide nears its flood, Yet touched with endless potency of pain, As lips of mothers when their anguish ebbs And leaves the waifling life. Then first the Dove Began to mourn above the mercy-seat, And the dear sister spirits of the Lamps Bent all their shimmering wings one way to screen Their wicks from the wind-flaw. Large with question turned Angelic eyes to archangelic eyes, Archangels laid changed lips to the ears of Thrones, Thrones gazed at Dominations, Powers made sign To Principalities; but not one dared, Voicing the fear that filled him, to cry, âLord, What hast Thou brought upon Thy kingdom, Thou Ancient of Days!â Their silence was right well. Raphael. All this the meditative spirits oft Have pondered. But thy meaning still is dark. Uriel. Ourselves who questioned why the world was made Were born of the same questionable seed, And we who feared were the first cause of fear. Of a dark thing I speak a few dark words. Of old the mind of God, coiled on itself In contemplation single and eterne, Felt suddenly a stealing wistfulness Sully the essence of his old content With pangs of dim division. Long He strove Against his bosom's deep necessity, Then, groping for surcease, put forth the orbs Of Paradise, with all their imagery, And the ordered hierarchies where we stand; Some sharing more in his essential calm, Some, rebel spirits, banished now or quelled, The ill-starred sons of his disquietude,â Disquietude not quenched when fell the pride Of Lucifer, long bastioned in the North. Demand of joy, hardly to be gainsaid, And vast necessity of grief, still worked Compulsive in his breast: our essence calm, Those lucid orbs accordant, could not bring Nepenthe long. His hand He still withheld Ages of ages, fearing the event, Till, bathed in brighter urge and wistfulness He put forth suddenly this vine of Time And hung the hollow dark with passionate change. Raphael. I think for me Heaven seemed not Heaven till then, When from our seats of peace we could behold The strife of ripening suns and withering moons, Marching of ice-floes, and the nameless wars Of monster races laboring to be man; When we could hear the wrestle of hoarse sound Hurl gust on gust obscurely toward the time Of disinvolvÃ¨d music: till at last, Standing erect amid the giant fernâ Uriel. At last! At last! O shaken Breast, nowhere Couldst thou find quiet save in putting forth This last imagination? Could no form Of being stanch thee in thy groping thought Save this of Man? Puny and terrible; Apt to imagine powers beyond himself In wind and lightning; cunning to evoke From mould and flint-stone the surprising fire, And carve the heavy hills to spiritual shapes Of town and temple; nursing in his veins More restlessness than called him from the void, Perfidies, hungers, dreams, idolatries, Pain, laughter, wonder, anger, sex, and song! Raphael. God had one other thought, more sweet, more dire; Thy latest words remind thee. Behind the trees a girl's voice sings. O daughters of Jerusalem! What said ye unto her Who took her love by the garment's hem, Where the tanned grape-gatherers were? Did any go down and see If she led him into her house? Or was it aloft where the wild harts flee, Was it high in the hills, 'neath the cedar-tree, That she kissed him and called him spouse? A young man and a girl come over the hill from the town. Uriel. Unto man Woman was due. To hearts of fire more fire, To pride of strength a still subduing strength. As they pass through the coppice, the girl sings. O keepers of the city walls! Have ye taken her veil away, Whose hasting feet and low love-calls Ye heard at the drop of day? Have ye taken her ankle-rings, Who is fair, who hath eyes like a dove? Must she seek her lover, her king of kings, Naked, stripped of her costly things? Must she have no garment but love? SCENE II A mountain glade and forest. Midnight. Shepherd. Here stand, if thou wilt see, by this great bole. This way they passed, and hither should return. But pray thee, gentle god, when they draw near Abate the splendor of thy face, fold close Thine eyed and irised plumage. God thou art, But thou must needs be mighty to escape The hill girls when they rage! From these old boughs The climbing moon will soon pour deeper shade To screen thee more. Raphael. How looked they when they passed? Shepherd Boy. Coney, how passed the hailstorm o'er, quotha! Patter! patter! 't was sung beneath i' the dark. I lost a birch cup full of whortleberries Scrambling to cover when I heard their songs. But when they burst across the glade, I peeped, And saw their breasts gleam through their angry hair. EvoÃ«! they had snared the village lad They hanker for so long. I hear them talk, Dawdling on well-curbs with their water-skins Or picking the May-apples. Shepherd. 'T is the lad Who sat mute at the merry threshing-stead, Turned from their orgies in the sacred wood With large bright eyes unamorous, and sang In lonesome places piercing lonesome songs Of other lives and other gods than theirsâ Perchance of thee and thy bright-wingÃ¨d mates, If mates be thine, for god thou surely art. Shepherd Boy. To-night they have him limed! Brow of the hawk, Throat of the hermit-thrush, and ring-dove eyes! Shepherd. He came across the moon-drench dragged by three Whose bodies shone like the peeled willow wand; The little snakes they knot into their hair Lipping his neck, where oozed the red of grapes From his crushed garland; his hands flung aloft To the symbol of their fierce licentious god. His eyes were large and fixed, his lips apart, As I have seen him in the lonesome woods, But madder than the maddest bacchant there! Raphael. Who cometh yonder? Shepherd. Where? Raphael. Across the glade. Shepherd. I see nought. Raphael. There, behind the trailing mist. The moonlight gathers to a ghostly shape, Unearthly silver, throbbing like a heart! It seems a beast and rider. The shepherds make off. Ah, I know That icy influence, and the voice I know, First heard in Heaven when time began to be,â A voice above our voices, and a hush Beneath our hush, freezing the heart with fear, With fear the heart even of spirit-kind. ... The Angel of the Pale Horse. Sings. The scourge of the wrath of God We swing and we stay: (Rest, my steed, rest!) On the green of the hill we have trod, And the green is grey. Ours is his scourging rod. Yea, thy hoofs long to be fleet On the armied hills; (Yet rest, my steed, rest!) Scent of the arrowy sleet Broadens thy nostrils; The mown field smelleth sweet. God giveth his loins' increase Into our hand; (Rest, my steed, rest!) We shall establish his peace By sea and by land. Soon shall their troubling cease! Raphael. What makes thine errand here? Angel of the Pale Horse. Still as of old. Raphael. I think thou art way-wandered. Here is life. Angel of the Pale Horse. My horse's feet err not; they are way-wise. Raphael. Stand by me in the shade of these old boughs, And let no anger fan thy wings alight Or flake the nostrils of thy horse with fire When the young bacchants halloo down the steep. Angel of the Pale Horse. Thou feedest thy giddy and half-human mind Still on these little spectacles of change, Forgetting Heaven's great woes! Raphael. What woe can come Into those courts of old beatitude? Angel of the Pale Horse. Hast thou not felt its presence there? Raphael. Yesânayâ I know not ... When I enter Heaven gate, Fear comes upon me, for I seem to feel Some subtle waning of accustomed joy, Some dying off of musicâthin, minute, As the single cricket amid chorusing fields, Whose ceasing breaks the rapture. Often, too, Wan faces shun me in the woods of light And voices of vague dolor die away Along the living lilies as I come. But this I held a phantasy of dream, Bred of too earnest looking on the blight That falls on mortal things. Angel of the Pale Horse. It is no dream; Though more mysterious, more dark than dream. Momently fades the splendor, momently Silence and dissonance like eating moths Scatter corruption on the choiring orbs. Raphael. No one declares the cause? Angel of the Pale Horse. The cause is here, Here in the vagrant courses of the moon, Who makes her lair and wanders for her love After her own loose law; in yonder stars, Gay spendthrifts of their plentitude of fire; In this most dissolute earth, who decks herself With gorgeous phantasy, and delicate whim, And paces forth before the worlds to dance A maiden measure, modest lids downcast To hide her harlot's guile; but more than these, And more than all, unutterably more, Here in the wild and sinful heart of man,â Of all the fruits upon creation's vine The thirstiest one to drain the vital breast Of God, wherein it grows. Raphael. Too fiery sweet Gushes the liquor from the vine He set, Man the broad leaf and maid the honeyed flower! The shepherds creep back, and stand peering from behind the tree at the angels. Raphael. Musing. What if they rendered up their wills to His? Hushed and subdued their personality? Became as members of the living tree? Angel of the Pale Horse. A whisper grows, various from tongue to tongue, That so He will attempt. Those who consent To render up their clamorous wills to Him, To merge their fretful being in his peace, He will accept: the rest He will destroy. The boy whispers to Raphael. Raphael. What wilt thou, little friend? Shepherd Boy. Hither, sweet god! But let the ghostly centaur stay behind. Shepherd. Lean o'er this rock and look into the gorge. See how their torches dip from ledge to ledge. They race beside some shape the torrent bears: The eddies seize it now, and leaning out Over the pool they stop to howl their hymns, And, now it plunges, how they madden down With laughter keen above the drumming foam. Raphael. Is 't not a man's torn trunk? Shepherd Boy. See those behind Grasping the antlers of the lunging stag, That bellows when their torches bite his flanks! I know the witch who rides him! Raphael. Come away That is a bleeding head she holds aloft Above the clutching of her comrades' hands! Shepherd Boy. No more thou 'lt shun their orgies in the wood, Throat of the hermit-thrush and ring-dove eyes! Throat of the mourning thrush, thy songs are done; Sad ring-dove eyes, the lids have shut you in! Shepherd. That is his harp the dancers bear before, Mocking his solemn songs of other gods And other lives than theirs. Raphael. Musing. Those who consent He will accept: the rest He will destroy! Shepherd Boy. Look! look! the ghostly centaur goeth down. ACT I Time: as in the Prelude PERSONS OF THE MASQUE Raphael Uriel Michael Azaziel The Angel of the Pale Horse The Angel of the White Horse The Angel of the Red Horse Spirits of the Throne-Lamps The Lion of the Throne The Eagle of the Throne The Angel of the Tree of Knowledge Spirits of the Saved Spirits of the Lost Moon-Spirits Voices SCENE I. A high mountain pass, down which flows a brook, with pools and waterfalls. Early morning. Raphael. Climbing, sings. On earth all is well, all is well on the sea; Though the day breaks dull All is well. Ere the thunder had ceased to yell I flew through the wash of the sea Wing and wing with my brother the gull. On the crumbling comb of the swell, With the spindrift slashing to lee, Poised we; The petrel thought us asleep Till sidewise round on stiffened wing, Keen and taut to take the swing With the glass-green avalanches in their swerving plunge and sweep, Down the glassy, down the prone, Swift as swerving thunder-stone, We shot the green crevasses And we hallooed down the passes Of the deep. On earth all is well, all is well. In the weeds of the beach lay the shell With the sleeper within, And the pulse of the sleeper showed through The walls of his delicate house That will wake with the sun into silver and purple and blue. Where the creek makes out and the sea makes in Between the low cliff-brows Was borne the talk of the aldered linn Matching the meadow's subtile din; And hark, from the grey high overhead The lark's keen joy was shed! For what though the morning sulky was And the punctual sun belated, His nest was snug in the tufted grass, Soft-lined and stoutly plaited, And shine sun may or stay away Nests must be celebrated! Drowsy with dawn, barely asail, Buzzes the blue-bottle over the shale, Scared from the pool by the leaping trout; And the brood of turtlings clamber out On the log by their oozy house. Round the roots of the cresses and stems of the ferns The muskrat goes by dodges and turns; Till she has seized her prey she heeds not the whine of her mouse. Lovingly, spitefully, each Kind unto kind makes speech; Marriage and birth and war, passion and hunger and thirst, Song and plotting and dream, as it was meant from the first! He climbs higher, and sings. Peering in the dust I thought âHow all creatures, small and great, For his pleasure God hath wrought!â When I saw the robins mate Low I sang unto my harp, âHappy, happy, his estate! âDown curved spaces He may warp With old planets; long and long, Where the snail doth tease and carp, âAsking with its jellied prong, A whole summer He may bide, Wondrous tiny lives among, Curious unsatisfied.â Still climbing. The trees grow stunted in this keener air, And scarce the hardiest blossoms dare to take Assurance from the sun. Southward the rocks Boast mosses and a poor increase of flowers, But all the northern shelters hold their snow. Such flowers as come, come not quite flower-like, But smitten from their gracious habitudes By some alarm, some vast and voiceless cry That just has ceased to echo ere I came. These white buds stand unnaturally white, Breathing no odors till their terror pass; Those grey souls toss their arms into the wind, Peer through their locks with bright distracted eyes And hug the elfin horror to their breastsâ Poor brain-turned gypsy wildings, doomed to birth In this uneasy region! ... Yonder lift The outposts of the habitable land. Ages of looking on the scene beyond Have worn the granite into shapes of woe And old disaster. He climbs higher, to where the ravine debouches into the Valley of the Judgment. Each time when I stand Upon the borders of this monstrous place, I still must question wherefore it was flung Thus ruinous with toppled peak and scaur, Sheer from the morning cliffs that hold up Heaven To nether caverns where no foot of man Has clambered down, nor eye of angel dared To spy upon the sluggish denizens, If any dwell so deep. What giant plow Harnessed to behemoth and mastodon Set this slope furrow down the side of the world? And to what harvest? ... Here the sons of men, Living and dead and yet unborn, might come Unto the final judgment; here the lost Might make one desperate stand. ... What moveth there? What leonine and wingÃ¨d shape is he Steals up yon gorge all desolate of light Whence voices of fierce-tongued and desperate streams Sound faint as throats of nooning doves? Till now Never have I beheld a living thing Amid these wastes. What manner beast is he That he hath power to awe me, though removed So far the fallen vastness of a cliff Wherefrom a temple might be quarried, looks Fit for a shepherd's sling? ... Surely he comes From nameless battle yonder in the depths; But whither steals he homeward there aloft? What lair is his cloud-hidden in the snows, Whose mates and loves wait 'neath the desert palms To hear him tell his deed? Huge was the fight That left that mighty prowess broken so! For sorely is he broken: now he stops And lies exhausted by an icy pool, Now labors up the shale, skirts the bald top, Drops with fierce caution down the further slope Eyeing the next hard pass. I wonder ... ? No ... Strange! 't was a blood-drop fell upon that flower A-tremble from the brink. Another here Upon the ground-mossânay, upon my handâ It falls all round me! ... Looking upward. Ah, an eagle goes Lame from the battle, mate or duelist Of him who crept by yonder. Even here I see the vast wings, shattered and unpenned, Almost refuse their labor; now he swerves To rest upon a needled dolomite, Then upward grievously another stage Toward some sad eyrie where his heart abides. I too must seek my eyrieâsad enough, Since there my heart abides not any more, Amid the waste infinitudes of light Missing the flow of day, the refluent dark; Amid the bliss of unconcerning eyes Remembering woman's anguish, man's resolve, Youth's wistful darling guess, kindled and quenched And quenched and kindled yet a little year In eyes too frail to hold their meaning long Where chance and enmity conspire with death. He flies up the Valley. SCENE II Above the peaks that crown the head of the Valley of the Judgment. Raphael. Flying. Soon will the cliffs of Heaven give easier way, For though my heart grows human, yet my frame With immaterial things accordance keeps, And to my feet these spiritual hills Feel native, and the climate kind to breathe; Still kindlier for the shredded mist of song That wanders here at morning and at eve Whispering witless words and prophecy. Voices. Above. Through the vines of tangled light In the jungles of the sun Swept the Hunter in his might And his lion-beagle dun Gaped for prey to left and right. O'er the passes of the moon Strode the Hunter in his wrath: The eagle sniffed the icy noon, âMaster, knowest thou the path? Shall we meet thy foe-man soon? âOn what interstellar plain, 'Mid what comet's blinding haze, Storm of star dust, meteor rain, Shall we spy his crouching gaze, Leap at him, and end thy pain?â Peace is on the heavenly meres, Sabbath lies on Paradise; But the little Throne-Lamp fears, For she sees the Master's eyes, And she tastes the Master's tears. Raphael. Many an age your song has hovered round This theme of Heaven's distress. What mean ye now? Was that the lion-hound of which ye sing Crept wounded hither, masterless, this hour? Voices. As before. Where had his gadding spirit led? Beside what peopled water-head Stooped he, or on what sleeping face Was he intent the dream to trace? Had creature love upon him fawned Or had he drunk of mortal mirth That he knew not what a morning dawned Over his darling earth? Heard not the storm, heard not the cries, Heard not the talk of the startled skies Over the guilty earth? Raphael. Those dubious voices fade, and in their stead Succeeds a sound more anxious and perturbed, Voices and mutterings of supernal wrath Or whisperings of fear. ... Ah, there aloft Upon the beetling rosy crag they stand, The pale horse and the white horse and the red! What rage vermilions his expanded wing? Why streams his mane so fiery on the wind Back from his staring eyeballs? What should make His brother's steady candor pulse and throb And falter like the light on cavern walls Rocked under by the tide? O never yet Did the pale horse seem terrible as now, Pawing the margent cliff and snorting down Pale fire into the Valley! ... Brothers, hail! I fare from outland. Tell me what befalls. Angel of the White Horse. He strays too much abroad. He hath not heard. Angel of the Pale Horse. They say that he has lived too much in the sun And waxes mortal, mortal. We shall see. Angel of the Red Horse. Saw'st thou aught stirring in the valley deeps? Raphael. Far down below a beast crept wounded hither. Why gaze ye on each other thus aghast? Angel of the Red Horse. Cast ye that wayâthe passes and defiles! This way will I. The Angels of the Horses disappear. Raphael. What news has spread concern Even to these marks and purlieus of God's dream? Below the sun's pale rim a paleness moves, Grows larger, blots the disc with deepening light. ... And now above the Valley treads a shape Too lordly to be aught but Uriel! Poised on a peak he halts to gaze behind; Now wingeth nearer, in the Eagle's trackâ Uriel. Approaching. Hail, brother. Raphael. Hail! Saw'st thou the fight below? Uriel. Of what I saw I cannot spell the sense, Too darkly hid for me! Raphael. Share me at least Thy news, though scant. That winged and brindled bulk, Whence came it and what quarry did it seek? And the great eagle, was it mate or foe? Uriel. No earthly beast it was, no earthly bird, Seeking no earthly quarry. More than this I know not how to say, ere I have mused Where in the sun's core light and thought are one. Raphael. But yet conjecture clamors at thy heart. Uriel. Thou knowest what whispers are abroad in Heaven; How God pines ever for his broken dream, Broken by vague division, whence who knows! And pangs of restless love too strong to quench Save by the putting of creation forth,â Quenched then but for a moment, since the worlds He made to soothe Him only vex Him more, Being compact of passion, violent, Exceeding quarrelsome, and in their midst Man the arch-troubler. Fainter whispers say He ponders how to win his prodigal By some extremity to render back The heritage abused, to merge again Each individual will into his will: Till when, his pangs increase. Raphael. A nine days' tale. I hold Him no such weakling! Yet ... and yet ... I have beheld ... I know not ... pallor couched On brows that wont to beacon; through the orbs Quivers of twilight, hints and flecks of change. ... We cannot be, we would not be, I deem, The same as ere space was, or time began To trellis there life's wild and various bloom. âWe linger. Let me hear. Uriel. Some things He made Out of his wistfulness, his ecstasy, And made them lovely fair; yet other some Out of his loathing, out of his remorse, Out of chagrin at the antinomy Cleaving his nature; these are monstrous shapes, Whereof the most abhorred one dwells below Within the caves and aged wells of dark Toward which this Valley plunges. There it waits Hoarding its ugly strength till time be full. Raphael. How nam'st thou him? Uriel. The spirits meditative Darkly name him: The Worm that Dieth not,â Perhaps the scourge reserved for those who prove Rebellious in the event, perhaps himself Scourge of the Scourger, biding but his hour To 'venge his miscreation. So he lies, A thing most opposite to spirit-kind, Most hated by the Four who guard the Throne, Within the viewless panoply of light Immediately ministrant. To them, But to the Lion and the Eagle most, Is given to gaze in the Eternal eyes Like hounds about a hunter's knee, that watch Each passion written on their master's brow, And having read his trouble, steal away To taste the troubler's flesh beneath their fangs. So stole away the Lion of the Throne, The Eagle for his aid. Beneath the moon Last night I came upon them stealing down, Too eager on the scent to mark my flight. Even to the splintered curb of the last profound I followed, and thence heard the battle rage Bellowed above by the loath elements, Till dawn showed in the east, an ashen dawn Clotted and drizzled o'er with sullen light. Raphael. Their hearts were faithful. They were fain to save The Master from some sad extremity. ... But not in yonder depths, alas, doth lie The arch-foe of his peace. Would it were so! A monster bred to hatred in the dark. Would it were so! not rather, as we fear, Man the uplifted stature, the proud mind, The laughter! Uriel. Speedily our doubt shall end, For not much more delayeth the event. âMy watch is set within the sun, and thither My hour constrains me. Raphael. Heavenward I. Farewell! SCENE III A garden in Heaven. The Eagle sits on the Tree of Knowledge; the Lion and the Angel of the White Horse rest beneath. Angel of the White Horse. Deep in the purple umbrage droops the bird, His sick eye sealed beneath the weary lid Which scarce his right wing's torn and gaping gold Disfeathered hideth, since long hours ago He sidewise tucked his wounded head away, Shunning the light's offense; and through the boughs Let sink this mighty pinion sinister A vast and ruined length, whereof the plumes That yesterday planed sunlike o'er the Throne Are all blood-rusted now and misted on With obscure breathings of a nadir clime. Between the Lion's paws a thousand flowers Have withered since he laid him groaning down, And in uneasy slumber racked with dreams Flingeth at whiles a sanguine froth abroad To sear what rests of herbage or of bloom Unwithered by his breath. They saw me not Though close I tracked them up the cloudy heights, Nor once have marked me through the exhausted hours While here I wait the time to question them. Hark! in their dreams they speak, and in their dreams Do act again their awful enterprise. The Eagle. Creep softly, softly! Heaven's streets are still, Each seraph sentry drowseth on his hill, The winds of song are folded, and as flowers Folded are all the domes and dreaming towers. Creep softly, softly; I am with thee, mate! Softly I soar above the shrouded gate, And till thou comest past the warding swords Lone in the outer moonlight I will wait. The Lion. Wing swiftly! For the walls of chrysopras Have melted at my roar to let me pass; But Heaven is up and peers with mazÃ¨d eyes, And wings are weighed to hinder our emprise. Wing swiftly, swiftly, down the glooming air, Past cloud and precipice and mountain stair, For ere another morning drowns the stars We must have met the Worm within his lair. The Eagle. Drear are the depths, O brother, Bitter the fight! Vainly we stand by each other. Thy might and my might Are as straw, in the flame and the smother. Angel of the White Horse. O ye familiars benedite, Who, hidden in the eternal glow, Keep guard about the Throne, What things were given to your sight Ere to the hold of such a foe Ye dared to venture down? The Lion. Awaking. Ages and ages we gazed, Stricken at heart and amazed, Till the morning look From his brow was strook, Silver and vair In the flame of his hair And his lip with anguish crazed. Then low I spoke to my mate, âMy heart must unburden its hate. I will walk through the pathless woods Where the wild stars hatch their broods, I will girdle the steppes Where the meteor creeps Like a slug on the rimy sward Perhaps at the trampled brink Where the Bear goes down to drink, Perhaps where on the purple seas Dance the young Pleiades, Somewhere at length I shall laugh in my strength Spying the Shape abhorred, Somewhere at last I shall break my fast On the flesh of the Foe of the Lord!â The Eagle. Wearily thou crep'st back Sore from the track; Thy hide was torn and thy tongue was black. Long thou did'st slumber and deep. The Lion. A voice came in my sleep Saying, âWhy wander so far? Nearhand lieth the earth Full of rumors of war, Of passion and pride no dearth. There in his cavern cold Lurketh the Dragon old; He lies and pastures, plain to see, On God's heart, sluggishly, As once he sucked of the fruits of gold Ages ago, on the Eden tree. Angel of the White Horse. Hearken! A wind walks in the Tree Though the lily-heads are still, From bough to bough inscrutably It feeleth out its will; And now the leaves, a-tremble long, Utter impulsive song. The Angel of the Tree. Not in the loosened whirlwinds that invade The sun's white core with shade, Not in the wandering tribes of fire that sweep With rapine through the deep, Not in the venom of the caverned Worm That drowseth out his term, Nay, not in these or aught akin to these Consisteth of God's groaning and disease The incorporeal germ. Though all that He hath made Rebels and is exceeding turbulent, Though all his loins' increase Go after pleasures other than He meant, And with excessive claims Drain and defile the founts of his content,â Yet only one of all the shapes He brought Out of the gulfs of thought, One only creature of his quickening hands Hath from its brow With reckless laugh and with reiterate vow Stripped clean away all decencies and shames; Till with continual strife And divagant demands Of separate life, The searching and the scornful heart of Man God's inmost being maims. The Eagle. For naught have my wings been broken, Vain are the wounds of thy paws! Hark what the Tree hath spoken. Angel of the Pale Horse. Hush! For a murmur shakes the bloom That once drank Eden dew, A shadowed wind like a word of doom Darkens the branches through. The Angel of the Tree. Now draweth on the time declared of old When He shall make division of the fold, Shall winnow out the kernels from the chaff, Shall tread his grapes, and in a silver cup Chalice the good wine up And cast away the pummace and the draff. Too long and much too long He hath endured his wrong. A little vine of life He set to grow Not far off from the footstool of his feet, That it might be in spring a pleasant show Of budding charities, In autumn clothe itself with temperate sweet Of love's long-mellowing fruit So mild the angel youth might pluck and eat Nor feel the mortal savor trouble shoot Across their holy ease. But now the vine, Grown waste and riotous, has sent its root With monstrous loop and twine In circles nine times nine About the bowels of his holy hill, And million-fold its mouth Has drunk his songful springs and quenched his veins with drouth. Twelve shapes of sculptured dream On Heaven's twelve gateways gleam, Jasper, chalcedony, and jade, Beryl and lazuline; And there-amid the rank leaves of the vine Earthy and lush At morn with laughter push, At evening droop and fade. Its carnal fruits are insolently laid, With stealth and hasty birth, Even in God's streets and in his garden bowers, And from the topmost glory of his towers Singeth and maketh mirth The exultation of its sudden flowers. Long and too long hath his compassion shrunk From laying of the axe unto the trunk; Nor, though the blade is ground, and kindled white The furnace, will He quite Even now, Even now, though day is late, Utterly burn and cast into the slough The thing He made to love and still is loath to hate. But first He will put off eternity And put on body of their flowering clay, That thus brought near He may familiarly Close in each ear the word of pleading say. Each blinding heart that stubborns all astray Shall hear Him calling closer than the blood That both its ruby gates with tumult fills; And to the wild procession of their wills Raving idolatrous in the sacred wood, His voice of poignant love Though quiet as the voice of dust to dust Shall clearly sound above The beaten cymbal and the shrewd-blown shell, Saying as soft as rain, âThe gift I gave I fain would have again, Ye have not used it well! Break ye the thyrsus and the phallic sign, Put off the ivy and the violet, A dearer standard shall before you shine And for your lustral foreheads ye shall twine A fairer garland yet, When the processions mild Shall greet you and behold you reconciled And sing you home across the deathless asphodel. But ye who will not so, Take up the phallus and the wreathÃ¨d snake, Let the wine flow, And let the mountains echo to your yell. Your ways lie by the burning of the lake Long kindled for your sake: Be ye not slow, But go Urging your panther teams through the wide woods of Hell!â ACT II Time: during and immediately after the Crucifixion. The outlying plains of Heaven. Storm and darkness. Raphael. But now the air was thick with panic shades Who made no answer when I cried to them Across the vortices of spiritual dark. Upon what stricken plain have I been flung, Whose miscreations blot with leaves like hands The far horizon light? Some glow-worm ghost Flees yonder, pauses, turns, and flees again: A woman spirit, by the anguish sweet Wakes in me at her anguish. Sister, hear! The Spirit of the Throne-Lamp. O Light undimmed, if thou art powerful, Speak to the wind! For see, my wings are torn And shelter not my lamp; 't is almost spent. Raphael. Me too the wind afflicts. Together thus Our wings will shield the flame. Already, see, It climbs and steadies in the crystal bowl, And purges half the terror from thine eyes, Thou love-lamp of the Lord! Are these his storms? By his allowance are we thus distraught? The Spirit of the Lamp. His throne is empty and Himself is gone. Raphael. Child, fright hath crazed thee. Lean thy shaking breast On mine: shut out the terrifying dark. The Spirit of the Lamp. He died with grieving o'er the world He made. Raphael. We live in Him; with Him shall all things die. Bright burns thy lamp; take heart, and tell me soon What hath befallen in Heaven. The Spirit of the Lamp. I know not well. My secret lies upon my heart too long.... Raphael. Nay, tremble not. Rather look out and see What presence comes; its influence makes cheer; 'T will be some spirit glad and resolute. Put by thy wings and look; my eyes are blind Watching the feverous pulsings of thy lamp. The Spirit of the Lamp. 'T is he whose tent is pitched within the sun, But hardly glad, no longer resolute. Even Uriel's lordly light the wind subdues. Raphael. Hail, Uriel! The Spirit of the Lamp. Hail! Uriel. Hail, brother! Sister, hail! Raphael. Close, lend thy breadth of wing! Thou art a strength. Speak, if thou knowest what has come to pass. Uriel. Something I know, and hither through the storms That vex the deeps and on disastrous shores Fling all frail stars that coast and merchant there, I come to learn the sequelâif to learn Be mine, in such a matter. Raphael. Speak. The Spirit of the Lamp. Oh, speak! Uriel. 'Neath pleachÃ¨d boughs and vines of ancient fire In the white centre of the sun I lay, And watched the armies of young seraphim Naked at play on the candescent plains, When suddenly the skies of flame were rent In sunder, and the plain became a sea Whereon the whirlwind walked through weltering lanes To the sun's core. With pain I made my way 'Twixt element and angry element. Vast shapes of gathering and dissolving fire That seemed as beast and bird, and awful frames Of shadow, dubious whether bird or beast Or fish or reptile, hidden until now In shifting caverns of the photosphere, Rose up across my path; and in their eyes Sat fear, and on their limbs astonishment. At last, long battling and bewildered oft, I gained the solar coasts. Wide round I saw Each planet passion-changed, each haggard star Reeling from flight and swoon, and the great deep Toiled like a runner's heart who runs with death. Calm at confusion's centre stood the Earth, A spiritual nimbus round her brow Like as a woman angel-visited, Sightless and deaf to all things save her swoon And her heart's solemn hallelujah. The Spirit of the Lamp. Oh, What hath He sent upon the joyous Earth? The Earth that has the blue and little flowers Thou brought'st me once to wreath my lamp withal, Earth-lover! But they faded very soon, And left a nameless hunger in my heart. Thy Earth was chosen, Raphael! Art thou glad? Raphael. Not glad nor sorry, sister, since not yet I know the meaning of our brother's words. Earth-wandering, and the shows of restless time, Have weighed the eyelids of my spirit down. Speak, Uriel, and speak plain. What followed then? Uriel. That rapt and solemn aspect of the Earth Soon drew me to her through the shuddering air; And circling swiftly round her as she went I neared the twilight verge that dipped toward night. Here on a sunset hill I stayed my wings. Rabble of people and much soldiery Poured thence into their city gates; the place Was steeped in level spendor after storm, And like to pillars of advancing fire Three trees of crucifixion loomed, whereon Three men hung crucified, one beautiful Beyond the measure of Man's flowering clay, Conspicuous o'er the world placed for a sign. Slowly to meet my gaze the dying lids Were lifted, and the faint eyes swam on mineâ Raphael. Nay, sister, sink not! We are three: be strong. The Spirit of the Lamp. I know whose eyes swam faint on thine! I know The sorrows that He suffered for his world, Ere ever He put off eternity And put on clay, to be by hands of clay Hung for a sign! Raphael. Above the pausing wind Hearken! a rush of pinions. Who are these That put an influence in this bitter air Like Spring when she comes galliard from the south? Uriel. The globe of amber light wherein they fly Goes ashen in the flaws. That ship of souls Tacks in the wind's teeth and is blown abroad Nigh Heaven's last confines. Now it veers again, And groweth larger: they will pass this way. Brother, lift up thy voice and sing to them. These be the spirits that within the moon Wander the lucent forests; shy are they Amid their wood-thoughts and their shy love-thoughts, Only by song their minds are quickly swayed. Wide has the ocean been for their frail wings, And wild the panic that has driven them forth From their still lunar isle. Thy song shall be A kindly net to snare them as they pass. Raphael. Sings. Shore-birds wet with deep-sea dew, Fold your wings and stay your flight; Stay, stay! Long was the way, Grieved with wind is your tender light, Stay, till our love rekindle you. Wood-birds that through lunar glens Flood the noon of night with singing, Hearken, hearken! Our minds undarken: O'er your phosphor forests winging, Say, what shadow scared you thence? The moon-spirits alight in a circle round the three angels. The Spirit of the Lamp. How fair they must have been ere yet their light Was ruined with the wind and flying spume, Being so fair, though ruined! First Moon-Spirit. Who are ye That seem so safe when every shaken world Voideth its tenantry, and even those stars That keep the marches and strongholds of space Flee with affrighted eyes down alien deeps, Or cling to the necks of comets, whispering words That stop them in their courses, though they be Violent souls and outlaw. Uriel. We are such As share God's sorrow in his evil time, And wait the issue of the desperate draught He drinks this hour to win surcease of pain. Second Moon-Spirit. Speak simply to the simple; make thy words Accordant to our minds; our element Is the moon's meek, unintellectual day. Uriel. You in the moon have felt his pangs more near Than may the passionate dwellers in quick worlds Wrapped in their own hot being; for your sphere Has cooled the angry metal in its veins, Its spent volcanoes utter now no more Their proud and hasty meanings; age by age Your world tends back to silence, rendering up Its selfhood and control into his hands Whence it rebelled, like all his prodigals, To spend the hoard of fire He dowered them with Too rashly. So it hangs, a doubtful ground: Now, brooded on by powers of heavenly peace, It goeth darkling and your hearts are dumb, Now, caught within the orbits of desire, It gathers ghostly splendor; in your woods Old rites are paid, and o'er your crystal peaks, That burn at the heart like genie-haunted gems, Sweeps revelry so wild that mortal men, Shepherds or sailors, gazing half a night, Wander at dawn brain-crazed. Third Moon-Spirit. Angel, we wait, We wait with trembling till thy lips declare This present hour's disaster. Whose the arm That broke our steppes in twain, and from the roots Of cloven hills haled shapes of former men And frames of monstrous ravin, ages dead? Whose mouth was set against the moon-children To blow their sheeny pleasances to dust And scare them from their world? What plains are these Whose spiritual pulse of light and dark Throbs as if hope and terror struggled there? Uriel. These are the plains of Heaven, least create Of God's creation, nearest to his hand When He would discreate, as now perchance, The deeps that teem with rebel energies Wanton, unteachable, intolerable, Whereof the soul of man, though meant to be His dearest pride and joy, is frowardest And first to vex Him: were Man's will subdued, The rest beneath his banners soon would swarm. Long hath He warned and pleaded, but to-day With a most searching bosom-whisper pleads; For in their likeness clad He gives Himself To die that they may live, accepting Him, Or, still rejecting, and preferring still Their own unto his pleasure, may be cast To outer darkness and the second death. These storms and perturbations are his throes, And here we wait until He reassume His attributes and kingdom. The Spirit of the Lamp. Will He come? And will the ancient peace be ours again? Speak, brother, will it be? Uriel. Hope still is ours. Tremble no more, sweet Flame! Good hope is ours. The Spirit of the Lamp. My secret lies upon my heart too long! Since first the trumpet told of Time begun, And in the seven bowls the seven flames, So white before and still, a patient praise, Leaped up in restless colors, fear hath stood A whispering eighth among the sisters seven, A thin small voice singing above our songs, A hush beneath our hush. Each side the throne The mystic olive trees began to blow, And on the candlesticks that burn beneath Dropped dying bloom and fruitage mortal ripe. When evening spread upon the holy hill Its excellence of peace, small restless wings, To Heaven unnative, fluttered round our lamps, Forever circling nearer till they threw Into the flame their lives of longing dust, And though we plucked the char out hastily A climbing rust had dulled our torch of praise. Nay, where the very breast of God should be, Forever panoplied with viewless light, Gnawed darkness like a worm, and when this wind That never came till now, blew wide and thin The splendor of the Throne-steadâhush, bend close!â His eyes were old with pain. Then all at onceâ O brothers, is it hours or Ã¦ons since?â Intolerable lambence lit the air; The sea of glass whereon the nations stand At morn to carol, curdled red as blood, And rolled a moaning billow to the shore; The Eagle screamed; upon the tabled gem Where was the footstool of God's feet, lay prone The Lion's whining muzzle; and the Calf Bleated beneath his six-times-folded wing. My sister lamps were quenched, but ere I fled I crept up past the Lion's awful paws, Up past the shrouding light, and saw His place Was empty. ... Is it hours or Ã¦ons since? I found the shadowed fields about me, grey Each hearted amaranth and asphodel, The living forests with their veins of light Looped thickly, and the burning flowers between, The living waters, and the lily souls Along the watersâall a stricken grey! Where'er I fled or turned it still pursuedâ That Nothingness that sat upon the Throne; And now it waits to seize meâyonder, here! Uriel. Hush, be of better comfort. Through the plain Auroral pallors wake the asphodels; The wind at last is still; and eastward far Beyond the friths and islands of that sea Which spreads before his dwelling in the Mount, Behold, beginning glories star the dusk, As if the clouds rolled burning from the throne, To show us signs and wonders risen there. And hark! the happy presage of keen wings Ingathering from the corners of the winds; Large light, and silvery calls and far replies, And deeps of song that call unto the deeps. Raphael. His agony is done: a little while He tarries, but He surely comes again Even though but for a little. The Spirit of the Lamp. Let us join These hasting companies whose steady flight Goes tempered to all manner instruments Borne in their midst by hidden taborists, Lute-players, and them that pluck the dulcimerâ All sweet musicians! Surely these go in Unto some holy matter. Raphael. Surely. Come! ACT III. SCENE I A peak above the Valley of the Judgment. Between midnight and dawn of the Day of Judgment. Raphael. Alas, on this lone height my pinions fail, And half my dreaming world unvisited! As a sick woman, who, when morning glooms Must leave for aye the house where she was wed, Yearns to behold the thrice-familiar rooms, And rises trembling, and with watch-lamp goes From chamber unto chamber, stopping now To muse upon her dead child's pictured brow, And now to dream of little merriments Enacted, and of trivial dear events, Until her weakness grows Upon her, and she sinks and cannot rise,â So, since upon the sad and prescient skies The darkness of this ultimate night was shed, My feet from haunted place to haunted place Of my familiar earth have kept their pace: Alas, that ere the half be mused upon, And while the coming up of dreadful day Is still an hour away My wing is broken, and my strength is gone! Star after star goes out above the peak, And only from the morning star is shed Keen influence. Great star! He is not weak, His pinions fail not; for he never quaffed This frail and fiery air that mortals drink: He has not heard when little children laughed; He has not watched old pensioners break their bread; To woman's lips he never held the draught Of anguish, that a man-child might be born; The May woods never saw him hiding there His wings and flaming hair To watch the young men pluck the budded thorn; Nor has his mouth put off its seraph scorn To hang with startled cry Of grievous inquiry Above the stoic forehead of the dead. O heart of man, how I have loved thee! Hidden in sunlight what sweet hours were mine Of lover-like espial upon thine; Thrilled with thy shadowy fears, half guessing The hope that lit thy veins like wine, Musing why this was bane and that thy blessing, My angel-ichor moved by all that moved thee; Though oft the meanings of thy joy and woe Were hid, were hard to know; For deep beneath the clear crystalline waters That feed the hearts of Heaven's sons and daughters, The roots of thy life go. O dreamer! O desirer! Goer down Unto untraveled seas in untried ships! O crusher of the unimagined grape On unconceivÃ¨d lips! O player upon a lordly instrument No man or god hath had in mind to invent; O cunning how to shape Effulgent Heaven and scoop out bitter Hell From the little shine and saltness of a tear; Sieger and harrier, Beyond the moon, of thine own builded town, Each morning won, each eve impregnable, Each noon evanished sheer! Thou fiery essence in a vase of fire! What quarry gathered and packed down the clay To make this delicate vessel of desire? Who digged it? In what mortar did he bray? Whose wistful hand did lead All round the lyric brede? Who tinted it, and burned the dross away? âHe, He,â (doth some one say?) âWhose mallet-arm is lift and knitted hard To break it into shard!â Were that the Maker's way? Who brings to being aught, Love is his skill untaught, Love is his ore, his furnace, and his tool; Who makes, destroyeth not, But much is dashed in pieces by the fool. O struggler in the mesh Of spirit and of flesh Some subtle hand hath tied to make thee Man, That now is unto thee a wide domain To laugh and love and dare in for a span, And straightway is a prison-house of pain, A den of loathing, and a violent place, A hold for unclean wing and cruel face That mock the searÃ¨d heart and darkened brain,â My bosom yearns above thee at the end, Thinking of all thy gladness, all thy woe; Whoever is thy foe, I am thy friend, thy friend! As thou hast striven, I strove to comprehend The piteous sundering set betwixt the zenith And nadir of thy fates, Whose life doth serious message send To moon and stars, anon itself demeaneth Below the brute estates. Wild heart, that through the steepening arcs art whirled To a bright master-world, And in a trice must blindly backward hark To the subtÃ¨rrene dark, Deem not that mighty gamut-frame was set For wanton finger-fret! No empty-hearted gymnast of the strings Gave the wild treble wings, Or flung the shuddering bass from Hell's last parapet. Though now the Master sad With vehemence shall break thee, Not lightly did He make thee, That morning when his heart was music-mad: Lovely importings then his looks and gestures had. Whatever cometh with to-morrow's light, Oh, deem not that in idlesse or in spite The strong knot of thy fate Was woven so implicate, Or that a jester put thee in that plight. Darkly, but oh, for good, for good, The spirit infinite Was throned upon the perishable blood; To moan and to be abject at the neap, To ride portentous on the shrieking scud Of the arousÃ¨d flood, And halcyon hours to preen and prate in the boon Tropical afternoon. Not in vain, not in vain, The spirit hath its sanguine stain, And from its senses five doth peer As a fawn from the green windows of a wood; Slave of the panic woodland fear, Boon-fellow in the game of blood and lust That fills with tragic mirth the woodland year, Searched with starry agonies Through the breast and through the reins, Maddened and led by lone moon-wandering cries. Dust unto dust complains, Dust laugheth out to dust, Sod unto sod moves fellowship, And the soul utters, as she must, Her meanings with a loose and carnal lip; But deep in her ambiguous eyes Forever shine and slip Quenchless expectancies, And in a far-off day she seems to put her trust. O Morning Star! that dost arise Haughtily now from off thy flaming throne, And standest in thy wings' outspreaded zone, With hand uplift and intense vision glad, More kindling while thy brother planets fade,â Wilt thou, the seldom-speaker, speak and say If this, if this be then the far-off day When God shall give the substance for the shade? When Man shall wake, and be no more adrad To lose the precious dream he dreamed he had, And the long groping of his heart be stayed? He answers not; the globÃ¨d light he wears Largens and largens like a wondrous flower, And in the midst his wavering radiance fades. Behold, upon the waters, them that be Above the heavens, how the lily light Blooms mystical and vast! till all the stars And all the gathered clouds that wait the day Are blotted by its rondure. Dimly grows From height to depth of that magnificence A splendor sad that taketh feature on. ... Lo! where God's body hangs upon the cross, Drooping from out yon skyey Golgotha Above the wills and passions of the world! O doomed, rejected world, awake! awake! See where He droopeth white and pitiful! Behold, his drooping brow is pitiful! Cry unto Him for pity. Climb, oh, haste, Climb swiftly up yon skyey Golgotha To where his feet are wounded! Even now He must have pity on his childish ones; He knoweth, He remembereth they are dust! Earth slumbers; and the freshening winds begin To blow from out the unuprisen east; Yet still abides that awful Eidolon Large on the face of Heaven, and its light Is as the patience of a thousand moons Upon the peaks and gorges of the vale. Now on that giant forehead slowly dawns Again the star, the bright, the morning star; Amid the changeful lampings of his orb The Angel stands, with keen out-spreaded wings, And lifted hand and intense vision glad, As when he led his brother orbs in song. But yet no word nor any breath of song Begins upon the region silences: All's hushed as ere the first-created throat Was vocal. Now remoter wonders wake, Impatient glories gather and transpeer That sky-suspended Image. Three by three The beryl gates, the gates of chrysoprase, And those that are a very perfect pearl Open, and all the citadel of God Even to the bright acropolis thereof, The temple of the ark of the covenant, Lies open, steeped in wroth light from the Throne; And all the heavenly folk are busy there. SCENE II A peak above the Valley of the Judgment. Twilight of the Day of Judgment. Michael. God's vengeance is full wrought, unless this form That labors from the dark mists of the Vale Be one whose strength has overlived our wrath, And the last hunger of whose heart shall be To creep from out that mass of death, and wait High on these ruined hills for death to come At nightfall, when the last strong soul must die. Nay, 't is no mortal creature, though he wears A fallen unhappy splendor, and his wings, All eyed and irised like the gladdest ones That glimmer in the pageantry of Heaven, Are folded sadly o'er his downcast eyes As now he sits and dreams. 'T is Raphael. Michael descends. Why sitteth Raphael disconsolate After the manifest glories of this day? Raphael. The rest may keep the glory. Michael. Wilt thou share The love-feast of the saved in Heaven to-night With hidden traitorous thoughts clouding thy heart? Raphael. Never again! Never again for me! Never again the lily souls that live Along the margent of the streams, shall grow More candid at my coming. Never more God's birds above the bearers of the Ark Shall make a wood of implicated wings, Swept by the wind of slow ecstatic song. Thy youths shall hold their summer cenacles; I am not of their fellowship, it seems. God's ancient peace shall feed them, as it feeds These yet uplifted hills. I would I knew Where bubbled that insistent spring. To drink Deep, and forget what I have seen to-day! Michael. What thou hast seen? The splendor of his power Sent forth against the wicked; his right arm Cleaving unbearable glories, lifted high To hurl his chivalry down slopes of flame With wheels and tramplings; the wide threshing-floor Become a furnace; drop by anguished drop The oozing of the wine-press of his wrath; The gross pulp cumbering the floor of the world, The little priceless liquor chaliced up, Borne back 'mid plaining silver and sweet throats For the Spirit's earliest house-gift to the Bride! Thou would'st forget this gladly, Raphael? Raphael. Yes, yes; right gladly. Michael. Yonder where the fight Flung its main sea of blood and broken souls Into the nether dark, I saw a youth Cling for a moment to a jutting rock And gaze back at the angel shapes that rode The neck of the avalanche; between the wings Of the pale horse and the red his vision pierced, Between the ranks of spectral charioteers, Supernal arms and banners prone for speed, Up to the central menace of the Hand That launched that bulk of ruin; and I saw A light of mighty pleasure fill his eyes At all that harness and dispatch of war Storming aslope. He laughed defiance back Ere down cascades of blood and fire was flung His body indistinguishably damned. How should this puny valor rise in glee To greet the power that crushed it, and thy heart, Angelically dowered, stand listless by? Raphael. Perhaps for thinking on another sight. After thy chivalry passed down and left The valley-trough cumbered and heaped with death, A broken girl o'er-lived to find the breast Her arms had clung to in the awful fall Strange, alien, not her lover's boyish shape She deemed she held, but gross with years and sins. Her changed eyes heavily a moment roamed, Then settled back on his, the darkened mate Whom chance had flung her at the hour extreme In scornful bridals. From his brow she drew The war-worn locks, and laid her kisses there Unutterable with life's Ã¨xtreme tenderness. Hark! where the last of those redeemed go by, Companioned of the hasting paranymphs Who hear afar the Spirit and the Bride Say âCome,â and see the nuptial torch alight Ere they have put their saffron vesture on,â Too eager for their goal to join the song Those throats redeemÃ¨d raise, save that their hearts Throb rhythmic with it, systole dim And bright diastole, with wax and wane Of spirit-splendor pulsing to the tune. Redeemed Spirits. Sing, as they fly past below. In the wilds of life astray, Held far from our delight, Following the cloud by day And the fire by night, Came we a desert way. O Lord, with apples feed us, With flagons stay! By Thy still waters lead us! As bird torn from the breast Of mother-cherishings, Far from the swaying nest Dies for the mother wings, So did the birth-hour wrest From Thy sweet will and word Our souls distressed. Open Thy breast, thou Bird! Raphael. Another neareth, chill upon the wind; Wan fire-flakes stain the clustering spires of cliff, From ledge to shoulder hapless echo clings And falters up. Michael. The pale one's homing-song! To-day he makes good harvest, and his voice Has autumn meanings; jealously and late His steed foregoes the trampled threshing-stead. Raphael. Terrible angel! Never until now Have I beheld his features through the veil Of pallor that enwrapped them; now at last Their terror is distinct, for triumph now And large appeasement lights them visibly, As o'er his horse's neck he strains for speed. Michael. One flieth with him, rosy-lit within. Raphael. Not as the battailous breathing of thy mates Enrubies them: more vesperine and sad. 'T will be the lordly light of Uriel, dimmed. Hail, Uriel! Quench thy speed. The Angel of the Pale Horse. Flying. Why tarry now? God's acts are throughly complished: Heaven stays Till all her sons be gathered. Flies past. Uriel. Alighting. Here I wait To see the swift reprisals Man shall take. Michael. Blaspheme not, lest I hurl thee down to swell The carrion sin that Raphael mourns above! Raphael. Uriel's place is there, by those pale heads, Those sightless eyes with awful question changed, Those desperate broken hands cheated in death With poor embraces chance and alien. Not Uriel's only,âmine, and thine, and theirs Thy warrior mates, and chiefly his whose breast Bathed in some dawn's bright urge and wistfulness Put out this lovely fruitage, this sweet vine Of man the leaf and maid the honeyed flower In mystic alternation, and when noon Spread clamor in the pulses of the vine, Was pined and plucked it up! Not so shall one Deal with another's, much less with his own. Michael. For sins not to be borne He cut them off. Murders, adulteries, and acts unclean, Idolatries, and broken covenants, Violent hearts and unconsidering tongues. Uriel. The violence and the unclean acts were his; Unto Himself himself brake covenant; Before the monstrous fancies of his heart His heart made heathen mummery and song. Wherefore to-day himself He punishes. Michael. Thy mouth uttereth darkness. Is all dream? Human and heavenly deed unmeaning both? Raphael. To Uriel. Brother, thou art all wisdom, as I know And still have proved rejoicingly, but now Thy word indeed is difficult and dark. Take not away Man's ancient dignity, The privilege and power to elect his ways, His kingly self-possession. Level not The head that lies too low to-day. Snatch not From brows abased the crown of personal will Which made them noble, though it brought them down, Being worn too carelessly, too like a wreath Of ivy or poppies meant for holiday. Man's agonies and ecstasies obscure Were more than shadow-show! Not all in vain His groping toward some quaint imagined good, His blood shed for a scruple, his low days Winged and illumined with long-suffering love! Uriel. Nay, not in vain were these, though otherwise Bound with the sum of things than unto Man Seemed likely, wearing that glad wreath he wore. And going after good the headstrong way. Raphael. We wait to hear this riddling talk made plain. Uriel. Truth is not soon made plain, nor in a breath Fluently solved while the chance listener waits, Nor by the elemental wrestling mind Wrung from the rock with sobs. Myself have held, Where in the sun's core light and thought are one, Ãons of question, and am darkling still. Raphael. Speak, brother, though thy words be hard and scant. The candle flame goes far a moonless night. Uriel. The worlds and all their tenantry are Him, Even to the utmost archipelagoes Gazed at by maritime angels ere they veer Homeward, awestruck by omens and sea-signs Known to no pilot of them, and far off Watch the scared islanders beside the straits,â All these, and whatso lies beyond our hail, Are effluence of the life that moves in Him, Thought of his brain, wish of his working blood: Yet every separate creature of his thought Hath separate claims and separate potencies. Oh, not a sparrow falleth to the ground But He regardeth it! Since ere it fell A little gladness died away in Him. And not a creature sinneth but He weeps His own sin with his creature'sâfourfold pain. Since god and creature, false each to itself, Was false each to the other. Not a heart O'ercometh evil and mounts up to good, But He o'ercometh and is lifted too. Each life of clay that flowered in fragrant deed, Each grass-blade that grew willingly, each bird That through the churlish weather hoarded song. Not only worked its own salvation out But helped Him in his old struggle with himselfâ Or might have helpedâor might have helped, it seemed. ... Raphael. Yet did not, thy disconsolate ending says. Uriel. Who shall dispute finalities with Him? Not Uriel. But as far as Uriel sees, Salvation lies annulled in yonder Vale And prone are God's true helpers. Michael. Clay of clay! Wassailers, fleshlings, quarrel-mongers, thieves Of pleasure, plighters of unholy troth, Mimes, gypsies, idol-breakers, idol-smiths, Dervishing fantasistsâmost likely help! Uriel. Unlikely: yet the marrow of his bones; Heat of the breath of his mouth; corpuscles red Energic in his veins, loud gainsayers Of death's insinuating whisper, âPeace!â ... Before the Heavens were spread, or He himself Rose from his changeless and unpictured dream, These stirred in Him, demanding to be dowered With individual shape and destiny,â Each one a soul, yet each incorporate With his great soul, which to far happy ends Should henceforth in a million shapes of will Immensely groan and travail, not with tears Alone, but laughter, with singing as with sobs. Oh, many a golden station on that march Lie backward of us! when the armÃ¨d worlds Broke leaguer round some conquered capital, And in the pleasure-places of its kings Sat down to feast, the unhelmed gleemen chanting Victory past and victory to come. Let me not darken thought with imagery! Still the naked word escapes me, being too vast, Too simple, for our little pictured speech. This chiefly I would say: the restless joy Which called God from his sleep and bade his hand Depict much life and language on the dark, Had other aims and meanings than are writ In yonder Valley for an epilogue. Man's violence was earnest of his strength, His sin a heady overflow, dynamic Unto all lovely uses, to be curbed And sweetened, never broken with the rod! Raphael. Why did He quench their passion? I have walked The rings of planets where strange-colored moons Hung thick as dew, in ocean orchards feared The glaucous tremble of the living boughs Whose fruit hath eyes and purpose; but nowhere Found any law but this: Passion is power, And, kindly tempered, saves. All things declare Struggle hath deeper peace than sleep can bring: The restlessness that put creation forth Impure and violent, held holier calm Than that Nirvana whence it wakened Him. Uriel. This day declares He deemeth otherwise. The Shining Wrestler, tired of strife, hath slain The dark antagonist whose enmity Gave Him rejoicing sinews; but of Him His foe was flesh of flesh and bone of bone; With suicidal hand He smote him down: Soon we shall feel His lethal pangs begin. Raphael. Fiercer than those that clove thy burning realms And sent grey winds to waste the plains of Heaven When on the Cross He sought to purchase peace And lure his wayward world back to his hand! Michael. His lightning dry thy tongue! Why should our minds Peer and conjecture of the danger past? Thou knowest what glory followeth. Raphael. Yes, I know. The clouds at last rolled burning from the Throne And let us see the risen wonders there. Again I hear the gathering psalmody Chant out the clement taleâeternal God Made clay, by hands of clay unto the Cross Hung for a sign, that who beholding Him Should find Him very God, might dwell with us In endless light and life. Again I hear The deep consenting chorus mount and merge The wayward crests of treble into one; But still between the calling deeps of song Vague and unacquiescent hung my heart, Conning the burden wistfully anew In hopes to find the joy my comrades found Hid in the dubious notes. Vague hung my heart, Wistful as morning boughs that watch the moon, Not strong as now when I have seen all clear And o'er the ashes of the world declareâ Listen! Are there not voices in the Vale? Michael. They talk together. Some die not till dark. Raphael. Aye, until dark! 'T will be a starless night. ACT IV Time: evening of the Day of Judgment. A rock in the Valley of the Judgment; about the rock, and filling the whole trough of the valley, lie the bodies of the lost. Twilight. Raphael. My lot is cast with these: I watch to-night Here islanded in death. Say me not nay: Till from the last lip anguish is unwreathed, From the last brow the frown of horror fades, Here I must sit, witness and comforter If any more conspicuous strengths survive To mutter or make signal in the dusk. Michael. Nay, brother, stay not. Though thy words are calm, Thy desperate eyes betray thee; thou resolvest Some sudden irremediable thing. The past is done, and, whether well or ill, Necessitously. Put on that robe of song Woven of youngest light and over-runed With flickerings of the golden elder speech, Wherein thou led'st the lily souls along Choregic o'er the unclouded psalmody And wert so starry long agone! Arise! My soul is heavy at thee. Thou art wan; Thine eyes are dull yet wild, even as these Who lie involved and heaped along the Vale Seeming in death to threaten and to rave. Arise and come away! Why tarry here To mourn above these outcast, since the fan Hath winnowed them and left no righteous one? Rather arise, make glad thy countenance, And through the courts of day let herald throats Softly declare thy coming, virgin hands, From that oraculous tree whose leaves are tongues, Laurel thee best of Heaven's lutanists And seat thee at the minstrel-hand of God. Raphael. You urge me well. I think my songs to-night Would cheer their festivals: I have a theme Of very present gladness, deeply conned. But if amid the gratulating chant, If through the dances orbed and interorbed, Furnished with solemn symbol and device, Perchance there stole a quite unfurnished shape Nakedly risen from this company? Holding up horrible accusing hands Against the nuptial light? That were scarce well. I fear my lute would glance and jangle off To themes as good unsung. Hark! Michael. 'T was a voice, Not distant. Raphael. Nay, 't is yonder,âhe who lies Half lifted from the jetsam of this sea Across that ragged reef. Another, hush! A woman's voice, was 't not? And see, belowâ That aged throat would fain articulate. ... They taste sweet speech ere the long silence comes. A Youth's Voice. Do any live but me? Do any wake to hear A word spoke in the dark before I die? An Old Man. An old and wakeful spirit rests thee near. A Young Woman. Long had I lain asleep, but wakened at thy cry. The Youth. Not all discourteous is the Conqueror's heart, Since now of that good strength I wore at noon Ebbs back a little part. Old Man. Enough to syllable thy soul's young scorn, Though all unripe, unwise; And haply rouse some one of these that lie Fixing the dark with undivining eyes Of human wit and seemliness forlorn, To speak their separate word or unto thine reply. The Youth. A song of scorn I minded to have sung, But all the words are faded from my tongue. Mysteriously withdrawn, Out of this desolation I am gone Aloft into the light of other days. My heart runs naked in the wind, more fleet Than are my flying feet, Above the misty foss and up the mountain lawn To seek the place of Morning where she stays. The silver summits held across the dawn By some gigantic arm, like wrought candelabras, Kindle their wicks of praise To light the temple builded not with hands Above the prostrate lands, And the religious winds, song-stoled, Pacing the mighty nave Fill azure dome and star-held architrave With hymns unto the gods that grow not old,â Lords of the joy of life made known Not unto gods alone, But perfectly to man and beast and stone, And by the atomies with rapture shared, But ne'er by poet's golden mouth Nor by the west wind singing to the south Fitly declared. Oh, for a voice Here in the doors of death To speak the praise of life, existence mere, The simple come and go of natural breath, And habitation of the body's house with its five windows clear! O souls defeated, broken, and undone, Rejoice with me, rejoice That we have walked beneath the moon and sun Not churlishly, nor slanderous of the bliss; But rather leaving this To the many prophets strict and sedulous Of that sad-spoken god Who now hath conquered and is surely king, Have given our lips for life to closely kiss, Have heard the sweet persuasion of the sod And been heart-credulous To trust the signs and whispers of the spring. Second Youth. Various the reasons why we could not pay The price exacted from us! My ear, though fain, I might have turned away From spring's love-startled promise, I might have given up the glorious sea And the majestic mountains might for me Have ceased to be; God, with one sudden rinsing of his hand, Might have wiped bare The earth-ball of its deeds and pageantries, Yea, even of light and air, That on the stark circumference I might stand And choose deliberately, unvexed of these, Between my will and his. Then I had said, with cheerful voice and strong, Somewhat dismayed, yet with a cheerful voice, âThis many days, Lord, I have thought it long Till I could put away creation's noise, The tragic streets, the poignant drip of rains, But chiefly the loud speaking in my veins Concerning this and that desirable. Now you have put me in a quiet place, Take but away your too expectant face, And all shall then be well. Then I can ponder, as I meant to do And as I singly long since thought was mine, The mysteries divine; Make quiet proof of you If you be verily my lord or no, And, having found you to be truly so, Shall understand for sooth, That down the eternities I may launch my mind Not as a tame hawk haggard down the wind, Whom huntsman's cry pursueth, But as an eagle without bell or jess, Obedient alone to his soul's lordliness. Third Youth. Better with captives in the slaver's pen Hear women sob, and sit with cursing men, Yea, better here among these writhen lips, Than pluck out from the blood its old companionships. If God had set me for one hour alone, Apart from clash of sword And trumpet-pealÃ¨d word, I think I should have fled unto his throne. But always ere the dayspring took the sky, Somewhere the silver trumpets were acry,â Sweet, high, oh, high and sweet! What voice could summon so but the soul's Paraclete? Whom should such voices call but me, to dare and die? O ye asleep here in the eyrie town, Ye mothers, babes, and maids, and aged men, The plain is full of foemen! Turn againâ Sleep sound, or waken half Only to hear our happy bugles laugh Lovely defiance down, As through the steep Grey streets we sweep, Each horse and man a ribbÃ¨d fan to scatter all that chaff! How from the lance-shock and the griding sword Untwine the still small accents of the Lord? How hear the Prince of Peace and Lord of Hosts Speak from the zenith 'mid his marshalled ghosts, âVengeance is mine, I will repay; Cease thou and come away!â Or having seen and harkened, how refrain From crying, heart and brain, âSo, Lord, Thou sayest it, Thineâ But also mine, ah, surely also mine! Else why and for what good This strength of arm my father got for me By perfect chastity, This glorious anger poured into my blood Out of my mother's depths of ardency?â A Confused Voice. Not very long to-day Thy arm held back the mischief of the tide! Thou could'st not check the play Of scythes, the awful chariots beside! Thy blood has ebbed a little from its pride. A Girl's Voice. I waited patiently and thought to hear The secret reason dark, The secret reason dark and dear Why none of us had heart to mark The pale evangel whispering from the sphere. For oft the moon between the garden boughs Her looks of summer longing would efface, And come to be a halo round the brows Of Him who died to give the sinner grace, Now saddening o'er His purchase from that place. And oft at dawn I heard the Sons of Morning Silvered with lovely menace fill the sky, And heard their solemn lips deliver warning What time the central singer lifted high, In the deep hush twixt ode and palinode, The sangrael of the sun, brimmed with redeeming blood. But how might I attend the minatory Voices of many angels breathing doom, When from the window of the little room My love's face had not faded, and the story His wakeful mouth had whispered in the gloom Spake in my pulses yet? And how at evening turn To feel those sad eyes down the moonlight yearn, When mouth to mouth and breast to aching breast I held my lover close, and by his nest The nightingale, scarce master of his mood, Now after faint essay And amorous dim delay Suddenly steeped his heart in song's mad plenitude? A Woman's Voice. What unripe girl is this who maketh bold To speak for lovers at the extreme hour, Yet fancy-paints the flower? Yet hides with image-gilt the naked gold? O sisters, brothers, help me to arise! Of God's two-hornÃ¨d throne I will lay hold And let Him see my eyes; That He may understand what love can be, And raise his curse, and set his children free. Another Woman's Voice. My life was a rank venomed weed And hers, I think, a flower; But my harsh voice shall have a power Fiercer than hers to plead. About his knees with curses I will cling, My veins I will break open, till He see The barb of the intolerable sting, The tongues of the immitigable fire He planted there to fret and fumble through me, To craze and to undo me, Till on the cruel altars where He threw me I slew my heart's desire! Old Man. Of double fetters be not fain, my child, To these thou wearest be thou reconciled. Spread not before his dark averted gaze (Now that He holds his hand and seemeth satisfied) The love that called you unappointed ways And filled your hearts with pride. A little while He left you free In passion's privilege To god it on the peaks of personality, But ye have walked too near the hither edge. Yet once I thoughtâ My old heart meekened to an evening mood By dint of years and much beatitudeâ He was not jealous as the prophet taught, Nor loving-tolerant as mild teachers held But swayed to mystical participation Of various delight By every chrysalid's meandering flight And million-footed onset of heroic nation; To instant joy impelled By every jet of life that from Time's fountain quelled. So deemed I, musing on the headstrong glee Of children at my knee, But He ordained his ways after another fashion. Fourth Youth. 'T was not the lover nor the warrior stirred His jealous arm to smite, Nor he who longed to launch forth as a bird In far and lonely flight To seek the truth of things, nor he who heard The choral winds in Nature's temple chaunting. All these He could endure, Since his creation and its furniture They merely used, nor vexed his ears with vaunting Themselves creators too And fashioners of worlds, and pilots of them flaunting Beside his in the blue. But some there were infatuate, audacious, To whom the world's vast girth Seemed niggard and unspacious; Who, having clambered or been borne on wings Above the realms of sense From off God's secret altars ravished thence The plastic fire of his imaginings And brought it down to earth. Then, pale with supernatural intention, We builders of the over-world arose, And softly to their houses of ascension, Orbing as soft as April buds unclose, But bowelled of the furious lava-stream, Star after ordered star went up the heavens of dream: Each from the other ever differing, Glory from glory, And each a world summed and replete With all the human heart forebodeth well Or hoardeth to repeat Of tragical and sweet In earthly summer and the mortal spring And man's peculiar story, Yet by the mind made an immortal thing, Patiently purged and weaned of its corruptible. Oh, how should Man into the dust be trod, Who is himself a god? How should the lord of each enchanted isle For gazing on a brother god's high sacrificial sorrow Say himself low and vile, Or for that Sufferer's sake Teen to his own undarkened being borrow, And in a gloom of abnegation break The wand wherewith he summoned from their sleep The whirlwinds of the everlasting deep, And souls of men and spirits of lost hours And spring's sequestered firstlings, the sky flowers, Bound to his golden powers? Michael. I wait no longer on their stammering tongues! Once more I pray thee rise and come away. The Valley darkens fast, and Heaven stays Thy single voice to make its concord full. Raphael. These voices we have hearkened lack as well, To make such concord as I care to hear. Michael. Then curse thee for a stubborn heart!âNay, nay, I will not curse thee whom I love. ... Take heed Lest any wing patrolling in the dark, Mistaking thee for one of these, should smite. Raphael. Already from the deeps approacheth one, Staining the limbs and faces of the dead With amber as he flies. What clime has blown Azaziel's radiance to so blear a tinct? Azaziel. Flying past. Woe! Woe! unto the dwellers in this Vale. Woe unto them who wait the second death! Prepare to meet the Worm that dieth not! Raphael. Azaziel, hear! What meaneth ...? Michael. He is past, Bearing his message further. How it sobs And falters on the wind! Raphael. In the deeps begins A myriad lamentation. ... Michael. Nearer now, And mixed with keener individual cry. ... Raphael. The sea of death sways moaning and recoils, Bristling with serried surf of forms uplift, Postures of supplication and despair, Forlorn attitudes! Michael. From the starless sky A star shoots screaming, hushes in mid-flight, And stands at gaze above the vasty caves, The caÃ±ons and the agÃ¨d wells of dark Toward which this Valley plunges. Raphael. Far below Disastrous splendor glares above the abyss, And in the midst a bulk of sinuous shade That lifts and swings a snaky head aloft Surveying where to strike. ... Michael. Away! Away! Even now his pendulous neck doth sweep the Vale From wall to wall, incredibly advanced Leagues hither, though his lewder folds are still Hid backward in the abyss. Away! Away! From yonder peak we may behold all safe: To linger here even spirits dare not. Raphael. Go; I tarry. Let me take thy mighty sword. A minstrel's hand can swing a blade at need. Michael. Not so. Forgive me this my violence! Thy soul is all distraught and desperate, And I must save thee in thine own despite. He overpowers Raphael, and bears him aloft just as the enormous swinging head of the Serpent blots out the scene. ACT V. SCENE I Time: as in Act IV. An exposed upland: one side looks down into the Valley of the Judgment, on the others the snow-peaks fade into the visionary cliffs and slopes crowned by the battlements of Heaven. Sunset glow still lingers on the heights: the moon is rising. Raphael. Awaking. Where are we, brother? I remember naught. Michael. Safe lifted o'er the Vale, and none too soon. Raphael. Help me to rise. Michael. Nay, rest thee yet a while. Raphael. Something of portent passes in the Valeâ I cannot well recall, but know 't is so By thy wild looking. Can thy vision pierce So downward through the mists? Mine eyes are weak And blink at the mild moon. Michael. Spare thou to look. Even me it grieveth, thee it will destroy With present heart-break. Raphael. O remembrance now Creeps moaning through the sea-halls of my mind,â A sluggish neap, with loss and wreckage strewn! Michael. The Serpent enters now that last defile High lifted toward the spiritual hills. Behind him as he came has silence fallen And gesture ceased: final ineloquence. These hither people are the lesser thewed But more inspirited, who held the fight Vanward against us, and who fell the first Before the whirlwind of our going down. Raphael. Is it too late to save this remnant few For seed of a new world, planted afar Beyond this trouble? Come, thy might and mine! He lifts a questioning head and seems to stand Hesitant at the mouth of the defile: There give him battle.... Michael. Nay. Raphael. Then I alone. Michael. Too late; and even if sooner, much too late! He brings the second death; his fangs have power, 'T is whispered, on the flaming seraphim To tarnish or to quench; one venom fleck Flung from his jaws, how might it lame and scar Our substance archangelical. Raphael. Yes, yes, You give me reasons to it. Lovelier Such scars upon the breast, though mortal proven, Than that fair sigil set upon thy brow The morn of thy first victory. Why live, Why live, when all these wills that searched the earthâ Until they found their one and inward love, Refusing to be stillâhave ceased to search, Though quite unsatisfied? To feel the night Unvexed of longing, and the day purged blank Of laughter and of sorrow and of brawl; No pride of life to glory in the sun, No ecstasy to mate the moon's increase, No heart interpreting the twilight thrushâ All the heart's business done! Nay, not for me! Mine ear hath lain too long on Nature's pulse, I cannot miss that music. Let me go. Michael. Still detaining him. Govern thy heart and tongue. Nature, thou knowest, Was but a bye-thought of the Eternal Mind, A whimâextravagant, repented of, And now in its chief element of Man Annihilate and put away, save those Who rendered up their wills to His, and share This night with Him the immortal quietudes. Lo, where the Serpent enters! Quick and dead Loosen their maimed embraces. From beneath Heaves the incumbent carnage. In the clefts And on the headlands scattered souls arise Expectant or imploring ... Now he reigns Instant among them, and their sayings-nay Decrease and come to nothing. Raphael. All is done: The great refusal made. The wayward heats That might have moved God's blood to sweetest ends In dreams and deed, have bled themselves away, And peace is his, though profitless. Michael. Hush! Look! The Worm goes on! Raphael. What say'st thou? Speak! Mine eyes are still too dim, I see not well What passes 'neath the drifting fogs. Michael. He mounts! He lays his length upward the visioned hills, The inviolable fundaments of Heaven! There where he climbs the kindled slopes grow pale, Ashen the amethystine dells, and dim The starry reaches. ... Now he coils his bull About a foreland, and the nacrous light It beetled with turns cinder. High he piles His folds, and seems to note the upward way. Hark, the trump sings to battle! I am called. He flies upward toward the walls of Heaven. Raphael. Alone. O darkest creature of God's shaping thought, Shamefulest born, in that unsacred hour When, pining for the pools of ancient sloth, His soul repenteth Him that He had made Man, and had put that passion out to use! Cleavest thou inward now to find the heart That bore thee shuddering and hath fostered thee With secret sweat of agonizing brows? Has this day's great defection armed thy fang And lit thy wrath to seek Him where He sits Sickening amid his harsh-established peace? On which side then shall Raphael be found,â The sociable spirit, very friend of man And Nature's old-time lover? Surely there At God's right hand, with a loud song for sword To beat the Spectre back when armies fail, And cheer Him as the shepherd Israel's king. He flies after Michael. SCENE II Raphael stands on a promontory of the cloudy slope up which the Serpent has passed. The Valley of the Judgment lies far below. Raphael. A mortal weariness beats down my wing; I cannot farther. Here I must remain, Whether I will or no a truant still, While battle rages round the heart of God,â A recreant on the very slopes where first With wistful feet from Heaven adventuring I sought those little flowers of shyest light Whose earthy hue and palpitance would speak A wild distress of sweetness, till my blood Sang wander-songs, and pictured to itself The happy outland chances of the spring. I think none grow now in the muted dells Nor on the chidden reaches; yetâperhapsâ If I should search as earnestly as once. ... My mind strays like a fevered child's to-night And plays with leaves and straws, regarding not How fate comes on next instant! ... Not alone, Not all companionless must I abide Its coming, love be praised who sends me love And comradeship now at my dearest need! For hither through the wintry windelstrae Flee, veer, and flee a fluttered company With hands outstretched and groping. Womankind, By the lorn influence that companions them And hangs grief in the wind. ... A taper's flame Streams backward o'er each trembling hand. 'T will be The seven dear sister spirits ancillary Who tend their lamps of laud before the Throne. Stay, sisters, stay! They swerve aside and flee More terror-stricken still. I prithee stay; 'T is Raphael calls! First Lamp. O then art thou too fled? Haste, let us flee together! We had thought All but the timid spirits still abode The battle's outcome. Timid thou art not, Though woman-gentle; is the battle lost? Or won? Oh, surely won, since thou art here. Raphael. I come from earthward. Mortal weariness Beat down my wing, and I was forced to stay. How goes the struggle? First Lamp. In and in it stormed From ring to lessening ring, until we fled, I and the sister Lamps, save only one, Our meekest and most patient flame of praise, Whom naught could make afraid. Now by the wind Distract, we wander on these withered hills. Second Lamp. How withered from the day thou brought'st us hence Flowers for our lampads!âtiny troublous things That living pierced us with a faint unrest And dying left a nameless woe behind. Raphael. Call up each sweetness over-lived, for soon Sweet shall be sweet no more, nor sad be sad. Momently yonder Heaven's heart of light Throbs feebler, and the dark gains on the day. Now where he runs afar, the sun hath felt Sharp pangs delay his feet, for swiftly hither In the distressful beaming of the moon Comes on the wasted light of Uriel. Uriel. Approaching. The dream is done! Petal by petal falls The coronal of creatured bloom God wove To deck his brows at dawn. Raphael. No hope remains? Uriel. To save Him from himself not cherubim Nor seraphim avail. Who loves not life Receiveth not life's gifts at any hand. Raphael. And life He loved not, though it sprang from Him? Uriel. He loved it not entirely, good and ill. Raphael. For what end should we love an evil thing? Uriel. Better than I thou knowest, truant soul! Who all the summer hours didst love to stoop O'er insect feuds, herb-whisperings, and watch The prurient-fingered sap startle the trees To sudden laughter of bloom. Better than I Thou knowest what lewd rebellion stings the core Of nature, bidding every seed awake To sacramental life after its kind; Better than I thou knowest what cruelties Rage round about each starry heroism, Out of what murky stuff the lover builds His soul's white habitation. 'T is not mine To lesson thee how height and depth are bound So straitly that when evil dies, as soon Good languishes, nor how the flesh and soul Quicken with striving, and when strife is done Decline from what they were. Raphael. Would He had dared To nerve each member of his mighty frameâ Man, beast, and tree, and all the shapes of will That dream their darling ends in clod and starâ To everlasting conflict, wringing peace From struggle, and from struggle peace again, Higher and sweeter and more passionate With every danger passed! Would He had spared That dark Antagonist whose enmity Gave Him rejoicing sinews, for of Him His foe was flesh of flesh and bone of bone, With suicidal hand He smote him down, And now indeed His lethal pangs begin. First Lamp. To Uriel. Brother, what lies beyond this trouble? Death? Uriel. All live in Him, with Him shall all things die. Second Lamp. And the snake reign, coiled on the holy hill? Uriel. Sorrow dies with the heart it feeds upon. Raphael. Look, where the red volcano of the fight Hath burst, and down the violated hills Pours ruin and repulse, a thousand streams Choked with the pomp and furniture of Heaven. In vain the Lion ramps against the tide, In vain from slope to slope the giant Wraths Rally but to be broken. Dwindling dim Across the blackened pampas of the wind The routed Horses flee with hoof and wing, Till their trine light is one, and now is quenched. Uriel. The spirits fugitive from Heaven's brink Put off their substance of ethereal fire And mourn phantasmal on the phantom alps. Fourth Lamp. Mourn, sisters! For our light is fading too. Thou of the topaz heart, thou of the jade, And thou sweet trembling opalâye are grown Grey things, and aged as God's sorrowing eyes. First Lamp. My wick burns blue and dim. Second Lamp. My oil is spent. Raphael. The moon smoulders; and naked from their seats The stars arise with lifted hands, and wait. THE DEATH OF EVE A Fragment ACT I A rocky mountain slope rising on the left by rude stone stairs towards Cain's stronghold in Nod, dimly discerned above. On the right and toward the rear the scene falls away to a wide desert country. In the foreground, on the lowest level of a terraced plateau, is a rudely sculptured well-curb. Behind this, on a higher level, a stone seat, known as the Seat of Supplication, faces the Mercy-Seat, a throne of the same primitive type, carved from the living rock. The mountain stair, which rises behind the Mercy-Seat toward the distant city, is barred, at a higher elevation, by a stone gateway. On the Seat of Supplication sits Eve, shrouded. Her hand rests on the shoulder of Jubal, who sits at her feet. As the scene progresses, the sky gradually fades, then flushes with the colors of a tropical sunset. Eve. Yea, Jubal? Jubal. Nothing, mother. Eve. Thy lips moved; The hand upon thy knee rose as in question, And fell as in reply. Jubal. I slept; I dreamed. Eve. Sleep yet; the heat is strong. Pause. Jubal. I dreamed he came At sunset here unto the Strangers' well To know us and our errand. Eve. Soon or late, They say; his custom. Jubal. Aye, they say it is. But why should travelers seeking to great Cain, Wayfarers, weaponed only with their hands, Or come, as now, in love and duty to himâ? Eve. I know not. 'T is his pleasure. Jubal. And 't is thine, Being, O mother, even what thou art And hast been what thou hast beenâ't is thy will To hide thy name, to wait obscurely here, Where at Cain's feet the desert suppliants Kneel to unload their wrongs! Eve. Question it not. Jubal. But I must wonder. Eve. Wonder not either. Jubal. Nay, I will not then. Pause. At home 't will be the hour When the parched flocks climb faster as they feed, Scenting the upper cisterns. Downward again Toward folding time. Eve. Gazing at the sky. I think the sun at home Sits not in such a shoulder of the heavens. We fetch him all about and overtake him. Jubal. So do we. Pause. Is it well that we do so? Eve. We make our journey; if the lights of Heaven Move from their ancient places as we move, Let the Heavens look to it; it is none of ours! Jubal. Thou sayest; and Jubal rises to thy words.â At home Eve never spake so. Eve. Jubal, Jubal, I know not what is in me! I am changed From all I was. Or am I back-returned Through life's deep changes to my changeless self? Look in my face, and say. Jubal. Thy face is changed;â And that behind the face, which looketh through, Peers like a stranger. Eve. Since our latest guide, Standing upon the red cliffs yester dawn, Pointed and said, âCain's City!ââ Jubal. Longer ago The change came. Eve. Murmurs. Know'st me. Jubal. O mother, since the night When thy loud whisper startled me awake, And following thee in wonder from the tents I found our camels houseled for the start, And the wide moonlit stretches calling us,â Since then, through desert perils, famine, beasts, More ravenous men, and thirst the crown of terrors, Thou art Eve, not that bowed soul we knew, Not that great worn and patient majesty; But like an angel going on an errand Not for his lord but for his longing self, Who burns from morn to morn and deep to deep Toward his place, so Eve is, since the time She fled, by night and stealth, from Adam's tent, And took the wilderness.âTo what purpose took, She keeps from me too long! Eve. Have I not said? To look upon my first-born's face again, And know him what he grows to. Jubal. I am content. Eve. Jubal believes I scant him? Jubal. I am content! There is no scanting in thee. Silence, speech, Giving, withholding, doing, and letting be, Sit on thee lovely as a change of jewels And bounteous as the River of the South: Forget my lips that they were troublesome. Eve. Why do you hold my words for less than truth? Jubal. Nay. Eve. Say on. Jubal. Freely? Eve. Say right freely on. Jubal. Eve knows ere Jubal speaks, yet he will speak. At home lies bed-rid Adam in the tent, With wasted hands and slow blank eyes agrope To find the sole things they remember plain, The hands and eyes of Eve, who never failed To meet that need till now. And Eve sits here, Within her eyes a high and thirsty light, Brighter than burning Adam ever stilled In that far storied morning of their loves; Within her handsâAlas, I speak too near! Eve. Speak on. Jubal. And in her handsâI know not how To say my meaning. Eve. Say, though. Jubal. On her hands, That lie so quiet and so empty here, A look as if they seized the hands of God, And dragged Him with her through his holy mountain Unwillingly to do her glorious will. Eve. Draws him to her. Nearer. Bend back. Now by sweet Adah's pangs, It is a goodly boy's face. Is it strong As it is fresh and goodly? Jubal. It is his Whom Eve chose out, a boy, and left unchosen Others, firm men. Eve. What if she tried them first, The others, the firm men? Seth, Enoch, all? Thy father Lamech, too, and Irad, too? Firm men, firm men! I shook them from their firmness! Sinews and blood and heart-strings, at a word Melted to water! At a woman's word, Touching far off her cloudy enterprise! Pause. One more is left to try! Long pause. Jubal. Mother, I saw When thou did'st speak with Seth. Eve. Startled. Saw'st? Thou saw'st? Jubal. I saw but heard not. Am no eaves-dropper, No peep-thief neither, but mind eyes had looked Before I knew 't was secret. Eve. Low. When was this? Jubal. Early the third night ere we fled away From Adam's tent-place. In the camel-close I sat among the beasts, for one was big And near her time. 'T was star-dusk, very still; Only the beast groan'd low and human-like, Or nosed my stroking hand and held her peace. Thereby, over against, a voice, thy voice, Never the words, only the naked voice, Heavy and scant, as if a half-dead tongue Fashioned its meaning stiffly. Then the moon Stood all at once her height upon the hill And showed thy form and Seth's within the gate. Thy face I could not see, but saw thy hands Raised unto Seth, pleading or threatening, And saw the face of Seth, with mortal fear Disfeatured,âupdrawn forehead, loosened jaw, And staring eyes gone empty.âThen, as one Who shakes the night-witch Lilith from his breast, He came into his manhood, took thy hands And drew them down, kissed thee, and spoke thee small As one bespeaks a trance-awakened child, Softly and small, until it knows itself And its familiar things. So went ye hence. And next day and the next Seth's eyes were on thee, Frightened and vague; but Eve walked straight her ways Not heeding him. Eve. Who heeds a broken staff? âNay, nay, that wrongs him! Broken not, but bent, No more but bent a little.âA good son, Tender and meek and patient with all men, And most with me, child, most of all with me! I blame not Seth. Let him look to it, then, He blame me not. O would't were by with blame! When has the oak been proud against the willow? Or the light aspen shook her jeweled hands In scorn of the removeless mountain pine? To every soul his stature, girth, and grain, Each sovereign to its end: the use is all.â And yet, and yetâLook you, he thought me crazed! So did the others, or were ripe to think. Some day they would have risen and stoned me forth, To be like those banned women of the rocks, Who haunt the savage summits of our land, Aye, you have seen them! They were human once, Daughters and sisters, mothers and right wives; And now they sit there, high up in the sun On noon-steeped crags, naked but for their hair,â She-satyrs laughing with their satyr mates: I might have sat aloft with them by now, And thought not strange to be there. Pause. Jubal. Eve must know Another thing, ere I have cleared my life. Eve. Clear thee! Jubal. I saw her speak with Abel too. Eve. Looking fearfully about. Thou sunlight shelter us! Abel? Jubal. His ghost. Eve. The night we fled away? Jubal. Thou know'st 't is so. Eve. How know? Albeit I blench to hear it said, Yet I do talk with Abel, my lost son, By night and day, forever! Jubal. Day and night, Life, death, the hid, the shown, are in thy knowledge. In his simplicity hath Jubal spoke, And now his heart is free. Eve. Not yet! Not yet! Abel? Thine eyes saw Abel? His risen ghost? Jubal. The thousand eyeballs of this flesh, they saw, What time my crowding spirits, wild and pale, Made all my curdled blood from head to heel Their tower of outlook. Eve. By the altar? Was it? Jubal. Yea, yea. Eve. Cain's altar? Jubal. Abel's altar mound; Though both be eat to nothing with the years. Eve. Aye, aye, the eating years! At first I thought I was mistook; 't would be the farther mound. After these years they should let something grow there. Jubal. Though salt were sown not, nor the stones not flung, No plant would spring within the awful vale Where murder first was born.âI followed thee Scarce hoping to come thence again alive, And crouched apart while Eve did call on Abel; Thrice did she cry on him. Eve. Ere I cried once I knew 't was vain. He would not let me go. Living and dead they failed me! Pause. Jubal. Lamech too! Eve. Ah, for thy father Lamech, honor him! Good father, and good husband to his wives! They point him and he goes, what man would not? Both fair, and one right good; Adah is good. Loves not much farther outward than her door, But that is well for women,ânarrow love, Narrow and deep. Jubal. Then 't is not well with Eve, Who loves as wide as life, though deep as death. Eve. Once, once! No longer now, these years of years! They would not have me so.âGreat years of years Since Eve in anguish called her wild heart in And taught it what to do.âYet, yet, thou sayestâ What said'st thou of me? Jubal. What thyself said first, O mighty Eve! Thy soul is back returned Through life's sad changes to that joy it was When first it soared into the new-made light. Eve. Seemeth almost it is so.âYears of years! Pause. Jubal. Hark! Heard'st thou? Eve. Women coming to the well. Jubal. As the voices approach. Mother, beseech ye, be as if we slept! For they will mock thee as before they did. Eve. I care not for their mocking. Jubal. Be besought! Chorus of Water-Bearers. Two groups, one of young, the other of old women, sing in alternation. Old Women. Like a hunter in his mountain walks the purpose of the Lord! Young Women. O, the prey alert and little, be its littleness its ward! Old Women. Like a linnet on the lime-twig sings the bow-string on the bow. Young Women. O, the serpent when he sitteth on his coils singeth so! Chorus (in unison). Even though, even though! Be it ours to flee and double, be it His to bring us low. Blessed she who tastes his arrow and lies broken in the wood. She has fled, she has fallen: it is good. They fill their jars at the well. First Woman. What makes the witch-wife hither? Have ye heard? Second Woman. What makes they all, who sit on yonder stone To wait Cain's coming? Third Woman. The old tale. Some sons of jackals, loping sharp-set by, Have sniffed her hut, and stopped unbid to meat; Some neighbor hath put sheep's-bane in her well; An idle whirlwind, rising up to play, Has wantoned with her little patch of dates, And left it bleeding. Second Woman. Has none spoke with her? Fourth Woman. Aye, to much purpose! She is sullen dumb, Sun-crazed, or hath a spirit. 'T was my son Who found her in the gates. âCain!â would she cry, And âCain!â again. By what she mumbled else She will be outlandish. Fifth Woman. By raiment too. And then the starveling camel, did you mark? Longer in limb and muzzle than our breed, The pelt more reddish. Fourth Woman. Let us stir her up! Some go toward Eve and Jubal. Abdera, a young girl, puts herself in their path. Abdera. Ye shall not mock them! Fourth Woman. What! Weaned since, swaddling-clout? Second Woman. The maid says well. They are all travel-spent. They sit like souls foredone for weariness. Fourth Woman. They feign! They feign! Saw ye? The stripling peeps And lowers beneath his arm! Second Woman. And let them feign. Take up your jars, and take your singing up. All except Abdera mount the path behind. Fourth Woman. Looking back. Look yon! Look yon! The little harlotry Stops for her hire. Third Woman. 'T will be the lad that pays! Chorus of Water-Bearers. As they ascend the slope behind, and pass through the gate. Till the coming up of day, Till the cool night flee away, Till the Hunter rises up to pursue, O my sisters, we will laugh, we will play! Though He wake and walk anear us, He is mused, He will not hear us; Though He wanders lone and late, He will never hear how mate whispereth to darkling mate. Yea, and though He hear, and though! Will He judge us, even so? He is mused, He walketh harmless. In the shadowy mountain hid We will lure our lovers to us, even as our mothers did! When He cometh forth at dawn, and His anger burns anew, As our hunted mothers did, even so we will do: Flee and crouch and feint and double, leap the snare or gnaw it through! Eve. Who art thou? Tell us. Abdera. Abdera. Eve. Whose daughter? Abdera. Till now the daughter of captivity, A leaf blown in by tempest of those wars Which crushed the stem I grew to. Eve. And from now? Abdera. Kneeling. If thou art earthly and hast need of love, Thy servant and thy daughter.âO receive me! Pause. Jubal. Mother, she waits. Wilt thou not speak to her? Her countenance, that was so bright, is fallen. Eve draws Abdera near and bends over her. Abdera. To Eve. Why weep'st thou? Pause. To Jubal. O why weeps she? At my words She looked beyond, with thinking, sightless eyes, As I have seen my father's gods to look Out of the dreaming stone; and thenâalas, Tell me what 't is you weep for! Eve. Lifting her head. Sweet my child, My fair new daughter, 't is for thee I weep. Abdera. No cause. See, I am glad now; all is well. Eve. Therefore I weep, that we all three are glad, And all is well, thrice well. She draws Jubal to her, also. To Jubal. What say you, boy? Hearts change! Here is a stranger in thy place. âThere is a wondrous vine called Jealousy; It springs between this pulse-beat and the next, And hangs the roofs of heaven with bitterness. Does Jubal feel it growing? Jubal. Nay,âI know not. Eve. To Abdera. He knows not. Then, alas, we know too well! Jubal. Touching his heart. Mother, the Vine! I felt it springing here Even as thou spakest, and hanging as it were The roofs of Heaven, but not with bitterness. Eve. There may be other seeds I know not of, That spring as fast, and load their trellises With leaves of light and lovely fruits between. Abdera. Some I have seen with fairy vans outspread Sail high, and yet no wind, or good as none. And some have hands and finger they will cling To sheep or goat or ass, all one to them So they be carried where they long to be. Eve. Aye, where they long to be! Winds of the world, Blow as ye will and blow what seeds ye will If this kind mingle in. Jubal. She wonders at us. Speak to her. Eve. Wonder'st thou? Are we so strange? Abdera. I was brought young to Cain's fierce citadel. And since, day after day, season by season, Now stark alone and now in bands of trouble, The hurt and hungry people gather in, To crouch upon this stone. Some I have feared, Yea, hated for the wickedness in them, Being myself made wicked by that hate; Some seemed to fade to nothing where they sat, Scarce there at all, and hardly gone, forgotten; Of some I asked in wonder, âWho are ye? What countrymen, what errand, and what cheer?â My heart not beating till the answer fell, And long, long wildly beating to remember.â To-day I came, and lo, nothing to wonder, Nothing to question of! Two trees of life Planted from always unto everlasting By the still waters; and my quiet soul, With outspread hands and upturned countenance In the bright shadow, saying, âGlory, glory!â Jubal. Low. One tree. Abdera. Low to Jubal. Thy parable? Jubal. Indicating Eve, who sits in reverie. She is the tree; And I with thee stand singing in her shadow. Eve. Rousing. What think the people of their master Cain? Abdera. That he is master; that he is lord and king. Eve. No more? Abdera. Some mutter darkly and apart. Eve. What should they mutter of? Abdera. Looking about as in fear. That Cain is old; That as he grows more weak he grows more cruel. Jubal. Cruel? To thee? Abdera. The storm that breaks the tower Roots not the little hyssop from the chink. Nor do I hold him cruel of his will, But in his withered blood a poison works, Distilling wrath and panic.âLong ago, In his hot youth, upon some jealousy He slew his brother. Then the angry gods Set on his brow a sign to know him by; And since, in hopeless visions of his bed, Or when the priestesses rave round his car, Gashing themselves, and to their frothÃ¨d mouths Setting the adder's mouth, or when he lairs, His madness on, with demons of the wasteâ The patient gods, the unwithdrawing gods, Dropwise and piecemeal wean his soul from him. Eve. Old? Madness? Withered? Girl, can'st thou not speak plain? Mutter not thou, whate'er yon rebels do! To Jubal. Did she say âoldâ? Jubal. What has she said amiss? âShe shrinks with fear. Eve. Old! Jubal. Seth, though the later born, Thou knowest, Seth tooâ Eve. Seth too? And what of him? Yes, yes, all's clear. Seth truly! That is well. Children as ye two be! To the dropped lamb The yearling from the father of the flock Stands not a hair apart in reverend time.â And cruel, say they? He was never so! Hasty and hot, a blood where rage would run As swift as sun-fire through dry prairie grass, But cruelânever that.âThy shoulder, Jubal. A faintness is come on me. 'Twill pass, 't is passing. Oldâold and cruel. She rouses again. Girl, girl! What else was't, then? Weak? As he grows more weak? Why I have seen The young oak shudder in his wrestling arms, And its torn roots come groaning from the hill, When for a sport he did but breathe himself. âAges of years!âThrust from his gate like dogs! Weak, weak, indeed, to be afeard of us. Her head sinks on Jubal's shoulder; her eyes close. Abdera kisses the hem of Eve's garment, rises, and takes up her jar. Abdera. She set me in the garden of her love; At first I grew, as ne'er by so sweet clime A tree was told to prosper and put forth; But at the last not so.âSour were my fruits, Apples of ignorance. She turns to go. Jubal. Where wilt thou go? Stay yet! I thoughtâO ye two spake such things! I thoughtâand thou wilt leave us now again? Abdera. Let me not leave you! Whither should I go? I know naught else.âI have been always here. Jubal. He draws Abdera to him. O never leave us more! Abdera. Yielding to his embrace. Fair, fair my brother. Jubal. âKnow'st thou nor guessest nothing who she is? Abdera. She is the tree 'neath which we sing together, Herself in all her boughs to Heaven singing. Jubal. She sings not to the Heavens, but to the earth; Once hoarsely, like a look-out overwatched, Now in a new voice, battle-songs and birth-songs. Abdera. When first I looked on her I seemed to sit A child and sleepy in my father's tent; The wandering prophet sang, and 'neath my lids I saw great shapes rise out of elder time; Beginning earth, with other beasts and birds; Ãonian forests where winged serpents flew; Seasons not ours, and long since fallen gods. Jubal. She saw creation's morning; she will stay To watch the everlasting twilight fall.â Abdera. Hush!â Jubal. Looking about. None to hear. Abdera. Pointing in fear. Look where above the sand The hot light dances. Should it dance for naught? Jubal. Know ye more gods but One? Abdera. My fathers knew; And sometimes IâHush! Bow thee! They walk, they hear! Jubal. Looking upward, toward the citadel. Not gods, but men, come from the eyrie town, Slow down the mountain stair! One walks between, And two that stead him upon either hand; And some before with singing, and yet some Behind, with spears and banners. Abdera. Whispers to Eve. Cain, he comes! All three rise and gaze upward. The procession descends. Cain, aged, and broken, seats himself in the throne-seat surrounded by his armed men, while Eve, veiled but for the eyes, stands supported by Jubal and Abdera. The chief officer at Cain's side lifts his hand. Chief Officer. The king is come into his judgment seatâ If any in this presence have a cause, The time is gracious, and the king gives ear. Eve. Gazing from Cain to one and another of his men. Seek not to try me, who am overtried! Is this the king, or sits one in his room? Cain. What says the woman? Officer. If thou be the king. Cain. What should be answered? Officer. Mock not thy servant, lord, Nor thy great self. Cain. Mutters. Still king, or not yet wakened From dreaming such a matter. To Eve. Unveil thy face. Uncover thee and speak. Eve drops her veil. Cain stares with slow gathering terror, then rises. Thou hag of hell, Glare not upon me with those caverned eyes! To his officers. Whoever has done this, his life shall pay. Do ye spread out your nets among the dead, And toll them here out of the earth and air To daunt me, and to shake me from myself? To the priests who advance. Try her if she be human! Speak the word! Make the dread sign! Eve. Make not your sign on me! For on your bloods and bodies ere the birth Myself have made on you a mightier sign. âCain, Cain, dost thou not know me? Look again! Cain, gazing at her stupefied, makes a sign to his men to leave him. Cain. As they linger. Back to the city! Away! Go, every one! They mount the steps, with backward looks. An aged warrior lingers. Jubal and Abdera, clinging together in awe and fear, slip away down the desert path behind. Warrior. By one who in suspicion has grown grey, And all to shield and warn thee, lord, be warned. Many and subtle are thine enemies. In many shapes they hunt thee for thy soul. Cain. Leave us alone! Go, go! Alone, alone. The old man mounts the steps. Cain, with averted head, mutters to Eve. God knows I know thee not. Eve. Approaching nearer. Cain, Cain, look up! Grieve no more; pity my grief. Eve knows thou knowest. He draws her to him, and sinks on the bench,âshe at his feet, her head buried in his knees. Song above, distant. Cain. As the singing ceases. The first that I remember of my life Was such a place, such a still afternoon, I sitting thus, thy bright head in my knees, And such a bird above us as him yonder Who dips and hushes, lifts and takes his note. I know not what child's trespass I had done, Nor why it drove the girl out of thy face, Clutched at thy heart with panic, and in thine eyes Set shuddering love. Eve. O my first-born, my child! O herald star in the wilderness appearing, After the nine-fold moon of dubious speech, Proclaiming silence soon to fall in Heavenâ The everlasting silence that soon did fall, When by me lay thy little frame of breathing, And blind and weak thou foundest out the breast! Cain. There was a day when winter held the hills And all the lower places looking sunward Knew that the spring was near. Until that day I had but walked in a boy's dream and dazzle, And in soft darkness folded on herself My soul had spun her blind and silken house. It was my birthday, for at earliest dawn You had crept to me in the outer tent, Kissed me with tears and laughter, whispering low That I was born, and that the world was there, A gift you had imagined and made for me. Now, as I climbed the morning hills, behold, Those words were true: the world at last was there; At last 't was mine, and I was born at last. I walked, and on my shoulders and my reins Strength rang like armor; I sat, and in my belly Strength gnawed like a new vinegar; I ran And strength was on me like superfluous wings, Even the six wings of the cherubim, Twice twain to cover me and twain to fly. Eve. O green tree! O the young man in the house! A gold frontlet of pride, and a green cedar! Pause. Cain. His voice changes. I knew that you would come. Eve. Lo, I am here. Cain. And knew 't would be too late. Eve. In full good time. Cain. Look on me; look once. Is this crazed frame The thing Eve bare in joy? Let us climb down Unto the sheep-pools; I will sit apart, And do thou lean thee out over the pool And look and tell me if that face be hers Who waited while yon silence fell in Heaven And Cain came forth the doors.âToo late, too late! Eve. Late, lateâbut in fair time! Never too late. Silence. Cain. They told me Eve was dead. Eve. Startled. They toldâalas, Who told? Cain. Chance-comers, wanderers from the waste. Eve. And do chance-wandering tongues still sound this name? Cain. Here one and there one, never aught aright, But every man his tale, after his heart. Eve. Even in the tent my people do me this. Even in my face, almost! Yea, I have lain, Bowed on thy father's breast, and heard them do it. I feigned to sleep; I heard them. And look you, son, Here is the worst. Their glozing tales once heard, Once pored on through long watches of the night, They rise before my soul like very truth, As bright, as fair, as strange,âalmost, almost! Cain. Darkly. On Adam's breast? How long since? Eve. The road is far, And hard to find. Also, the second moon, One camel sickened, and his pining mate Went laggard.âSon, what ails thee? Cain. He lives? Eve. Who lives? âAye, aye, he lives. Hast heard aught, child? He lives, Surely thy father lives. Cain. And thou art here? Eve. But most for his sake.âListen while I tell! âWhy do you harshly thrust my hands away, And lift your clenched hands trembling to the sky With wild and smothered words? Cain. Pushing her from him. I know you not, Unclasp my knees.âI thought you were yourself Yours, therefore mine at last. It is not so. His, his, the same as when he cursed me forth And Eve stood stockish, never one plea made, One wail set up, one gesture of farewell, No more than from a stone! Eve. She was a stone; As afterwards, long years, a frozen stone. No seasons and no weather on the earth; Sun, moon, and stars dead in a field of death; And in her dead heart, nothing, nothing, nothing! After long years, she wakened, knew herself, Rose up to wring some profit from her days, Conceived again, and once again brought forth; Yea, saw the teeming race in circles kindle Roaring to God, a flame of generation. From out the tossing battle of that fire Flashed seldom and again wild news of thee, And one red instant, ere night drove between, Thy form would stand gigantic in the glare, Islanded huge among thine enemies,â As when the ice-bear rears upon the floe And swings her flailing paws against the pack, Or when the sea-volcano from his loins Shakes climbing cities. Cain. Better, better far That Eve had never sought, nor Cain been found, Than thus, being together, to be sundered More than by ice-fields or the raving sea. Eve. O Cain, how sundered?âLook on me! Kiss my lips, And feel it is not so. Cain. Repulsing her. 'T is not so then. There is no gateway shut between our souls, No watchers stationed, and no lifted sword Flaming forever! Eve. Ere I fled to thee I knelt in fear by Abel's altar-mound And begged his leave to go. His spirit rose, Or seemed to rise, and seemed to threaten me. The same night on thy father's breast I bowed, And spoke of this my journey. In his eyes, If still they seemed to know me who I was, Kindled none other knowledge.âAlbeit I rose, And fled away, and suffered much, and came, Thy name among the nations my sole guide, Desire of thee my strength and company. âBe glad of me! O lovingly entreat me! Make all my meanings good, till such a time As these our wounds are healed. Then if, perchance, Our hearts at ease, I something should unveil My stranger will, my cloudier purposesâ Cain. Yea, yea, I wondered what would lurk behind! âNot for my sake, that were too mere a mother. âWills, purposes! Lo, am I taken in Because your tongue veers off and skirts the quick? Do I not hear the words you dare not speak Thunder above your speech? Do not your eyes Hover and flinch and crawl upon my brow, Seeking, and shuddering off to turn again In sick and deadly search?âLook then! 'T is here. He pushes back the head-band, baring the sign. It is not faded, though these hands have shed Rivers of kindred blood to wash it off. â'T was this you came for: bring your errand full. Look and begone! Eve, staring at the Sign, has fainted. Her head drops on Cain's shoulder. He tries to lift her head. Pitiful God, not this! She could not come after the endless years, To go so soon.âMother, thou wilt not deal Thus much unkindness to an unkind son, As leave him when harsh words were on his lips. Of old, when in our rage we thrust thee out, Thou wouldst return again, unreconciled To harshness and to wrath. O do it now, In pity! Eve. Waking. Where am I? Cain. Thou living Dread, Whose fountains yet flow mercy! Eve. What hath passed?â A faintness overfell me. Often of late, But never quite so deep, so heavy deep. I am far come, child. Lead me to thy house. Much must be said, but there is time for all. Nothing in haste; nothing before its hour. Cain. Wait till I call my people. Eve. Rising. I am strong. We will go up together.âI have dreamed Of this our going-in, and spite of all 'T is very like my dream, yea, very like.â Thy people cursed me, stoned and thrust me down; But now I walk under thy mighty shadow.â She pauses in their ascent, and looks out over the desert. Where will my children be? Cain. Thy children, mother? Eve. Jubal, my travel-mate, a stripling boy But great of heart; and Abdera, thy maid. Cain. Mine? Eve. So: thou hast forgot or never knew. Leave them; no matter where. They cannot stray. The sun will shepherd them. Cain. The sun is set. Eve. The stars, then, pouring influence.âLead me on. Art thou faint, also? Two can make a strength. They begin to mount the steps. Above, Azrael, the Death Angel, appears, slowly descending, as from the city. With his left hand he clasps to his breast the hilt of a long sword; in his right he holds a stalk of flowering asphodel. Eve, seeing him, shrinks back, drawing Cain with her. Azrael, gazing at the pair, lifts the asphodel and descends to the left by a desert path, disappearing behind the Seat of Supplication. Eve gazes at the apparition in terrified silence, points at it as it disappears, then hides her head in Cain's breast. Cain. What ails thee, mother? Why dost thou point and peer And shrink awayâ? Eve. Whispers. Saw'st nothing? Cain. Where? Eve. Pointing. Yonder. And there, and yonder. Cain. Nothing. Eve. Look again! Eve stands with face averted, while Cain peers over where the path behind the Seat of Supplication descends hidden to the plain. Cain. Two by the sheep-wells walking. Eve. Two? Cain. Thine eyes! Thy lips, mother! Eve. How many did ye say? Cain. Twain, boy and girl. Eve. Lord, Lord! Cain. Mother, thy faceâ? Eve. And this my son saw nothing! Cain. What should I see? Eve. Nothing.âI praise Him. Long years yet for thee,â Fair years, till then.âNothing. I praise Him! Cain. Thou hast endured too much. If in her house And throne of rule that sovereign mind be shaken, Yet night and sleep and the new-risen dayâ Eve. Nor night nor day can help me who have seen The angel of the Lord, the summoner. There, there he stood, and lifted slowly up His pallid flower, and without speech said, âCome!â As once before in Adam's tent he did, And Eve, beholding, rose and fled away, To look on thee ere darkness. Son, thou strength, Spread thy strong hands o'er this rebellious head, That our two strengths yet for a little while May hold against Jehovah! My fierce son, Thou burning flame from childhood, look on me And say that thou wilt do it, though the skies Open to warn us back! Thy promise, Cain! Cain. What would ye of me, that these opening skies And that up-startled Wrathâ? Eve. I had a son Who questioned his own wrath, the skies thereof, His own heart's wrathful skies, what they were prone to, And seeing where his will went, followed it. I came to find that son. And shall I find him But as the rest, whose marrow in their bones Curdles to hear Eve's whisper? Nay, thou Cain, Whose soul is as a torch blown back for speed, 'T is thou shalt light me on that fearful way That I must go, and that I haste to go Ere darkness falls forever. Cain. Though Cain were still That flame which once he was, how should he light thee, Not knowing of thy way nor of thine errand? Fearful? And be it so. My goings-out And comings-in be fearful. Tell me plain. Eve. Plain will I tell thee, son.âThere was a placeâ There was a placeâand it will still be there, For nightly I am told soâthere is a place That onceâ Cain. Mother! Eve. That once I knewâ Cain. O woman! Eve. Thou sayest.âA place that Eve the woman knew, Once, far off, long ago, when she was youngâ With himâ Cain. Hush! Eve. Young with himâ Cain. Wilt thou be still? Eve. Adam the manâ Cain. Woe on thee! Eve. Him the man And her the woman, in their ignoranceâ And still it waits there, waits for her to come, Now she has gathered up a little knowledge.â Be patient, child.âSee, I am very patient. I tell thee quietly I would go thither; Ere darkness falls, Eve must go back again. She hath an errand. Cain. Will thy lips cease now, Ere they bring doomsday down? Eve. Hast everâlistenâ Hast ever, in thy desert wanderings, Seen, or had news? Seen mayhap afar offâ? Cain. Once, once! Eve. Far off? Or near to? Cain. Near enough. Eve. Ye stood and saw? Cain. Yea, verily. Eve. How near? Cain. Flesh goes not nearer than this flesh went near, Yet 't was far off. Eve. How far? Cain. Far as a hawk Up-wind can keep his wings set. Eve. Very near! âSaw'st thouâ? Cain. O mother, hush on what I saw! Hush, for thy life's sake, for thy reason's sake. âNight falls. Lean on me; let me lead thee home. Eve. Home thou must lead me, to that wondrous home That was and is and shall be till I come. âTurn not away so!âTouching this same journey, I humbly do beseech thee, look thereon, And be well pleased to lend thy royal favor, Thereto the needed beasts and muniments Proportioned to the distance and the time; This only being besought, that my twain children, Jubal and her, go up with me along Into the gaze and silence of the Lord, And that our starting be by dawn to-morrow.â Unless, by favor, thy decreeing lips Should breathe âTo-nightâ and do it. Might it be? 'T is but an hour to moonrise, and the moon Is at her full, or nearly. Say'st âTo-night?â Aye, aye, thy silence cries I have a son! âTo-night! That is right royal. Cain. Neither to-night, Nor yet to-morrow, nor the day to come, Nor any day till Cain, Eve's bloody son, Gone brain-sick as his damâCall to him then And haply he will hear thee where he raves Above his moaning nation! But for nowâ Eve. Now, even now. So, I beseech no more. But lay on thee my still and high command. Cain. I will not hear thee; cannot, dare not hear! Eve. Thou wilt not hear me? Yea, but thou wilt hear! Thy ears be not thy ears. I moulded them. Thy life is not thy life. I gave it thee, And do require it back. Thy beating heart Beats not unto itself, but unto me, Whose voice did tell it when to beat and how. Thy deeds are not thy deeds. Ye conned them here, Under this breast, where lay great store of deeds Undone, for thee to choose from. She uncovers the Sign on his forehead. 'T is not thy head Weareth this Sign. 'T is my most cruel head, Whose cruel hand, whose swift and bloody hand Smote in its rage my own fair man-child down. Not thy hand, Cain, not thine; but my dark hand; And my dark forehead wears the sign thereof, As now I take it on me. She kisses him on the Sign. Cain. With bowed head. Peace, at last. After these struggles, peace. Eve. At dawn, O Cain? Cain. Whenever and wherever. Eve. My great son! Cain and Eve mount toward the gate, and pass through, out of sight. Jubal and Abdera appear from the valley, behind the Seat of Supplication, and mount toward the city. Under the gate Jubal stops and looks over the desert. Jubal. O Abdera, the strangeness of the world. Abdera. Not strange.âStrange, strange before; no longer so. Jubal. Look where the star leans flaming from his throne And viewless worlds are suppliant in his porches. They pass through the gate and disappear, climbing upward. END OF VOLUME I</field>
