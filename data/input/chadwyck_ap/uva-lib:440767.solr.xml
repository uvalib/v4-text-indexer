      <field name="fulltext">Prologue Lord, Can a Crumb of Dust the Earth outweigh, Outmatch all mountains, nay the Chrystall Sky? Imbosom in't designs that shall Display And trace into the Boundless Deity? Yea hand a Pen whose moysture doth guild ore Eternall Glory with a glorious glore. If it its Pen had of an Angels Quill, And Sharpend on a Pretious Stone ground tite, And dipt in Liquid Gold, and mov'de by Skill In Christall leaves should golden Letters write It would but blot and blur yea jag, and jar Unless thou mak'st the Pen, and Scribener. I am this Crumb of Dust which is design'd To make my Pen unto thy Praise alone, And my dull Phancy I would gladly grinde Unto an Edge on Zions Pretious Stone. And Write in Liquid Gold upon thy Name My Letters till thy glory forth doth flame. Let not th'attempts breake down my Dust I pray Nor laugh thou them to scorn but pardon give. Inspire this Crumb of Dust till it display Thy Glory through't: and then thy dust shall live. Its failings then thou'lt overlook I trust, They being Slips slipt from thy Crumb of Dust. Thy Crumb of Dust breaths two words from its breast, That thou wilt guide its pen to write aright To Prove thou art, and that thou art the best And shew thy Properties to shine most bright. And then thy Works will shine as flowers on Stems Or as in Jewellary Shops, do jems. Preparatory Meditations before my Approach to the Lords Supper. Chiefly upon the Doctrin preached upon the Day of administration 1. Meditation Westfield 23.5m [July] 1682. What Love is this of thine, that Cannot bee In thine Infinity, O Lord, Confinde, Unless it in thy very Person see, Infinity, and Finity Conjoyn'd? What hath thy Godhead, as not satisfide Marri'de our Manhood, making it its Bride? Oh, Matchless Love! filling Heaven to the brim! O're running it: all running o're beside This World! Nay Overflowing Hell; wherein For thine Elect, there rose a mighty Tide! That there our Veans might through thy Person bleed, To quench those flames, that else would on us feed. Oh! that thy Love might overflow my Heart! To fire the same with Love: for Love I would. But oh! my streight'ned Breast! my Lifeless Sparke! My Fireless Flame! What Chilly Love, and Cold? In measure small! In Manner Chilly! See. Lord blow the Coal: Thy Love Enflame in mee. 2. Meditation on Can. 1.3. Thy Name is an Ointment poured out. 12.9m [Nov.] 1682. My Dear, Deare, Lord I do thee Saviour Call: Thou in my very Soul art, as I Deem, Soe High, not High enough, Soe Great; too small: Soe Deare, not Dear enough in my esteem. Soe Noble, yet So Base: too Low; too Tall: Thou Full, and Empty art: Nothing, yet all. A Precious Pearle, above all price dost 'bide. Rubies no Rubies are at all to thee. Blushes of burnisht Glory Sparkling Slide From every Square in various Colour'd glee Nay Life itselfe in Sparkling Spangles Choice. A Precious Pearle thou art above all price. Oh! that my Soul, Heavens Workmanship (within My Wicker'd Cage,) that Bird of Paradise Inlin'de with Glorious Grace up to the brim Might be thy Cabbinet, oh Pearle of Price. Oh! let thy Pearle, Lord, Cabbinet in mee. I'st then be rich! nay rich enough for thee. My Heart, oh Lord, for thy Pomander gain. Be thou thyselfe my sweet Perfume therein. Make it thy Box, and let thy Pretious Name My Pretious Ointment be emboxt therein. If I thy box and thou my Ointment bee I shall be sweet, nay, sweet enough for thee. Enough! Enough! oh! let me eat my Word. For if Accounts be ballanc'd any way, Can my poore Eggeshell ever be an Hoard, Of Excellence enough for thee? Nay: nay. Yet may I Purse, and thou my Mony bee. I have enough. Enough in having thee. 3. Meditation. Can. 1.3. Thy Good Ointment 11.12m [Feb.] 1682. How sweet a Lord is mine? If any should Guarded, Engarden'd, nay, Imbosomd bee In reechs of Odours, Gales of Spices, Folds Of Aromaticks, Oh! how sweet was hee? He would be sweet, and yet his sweetest Wave Compar'de to thee my Lord, no Sweet would have. A Box of Ointments, broke; sweetness most sweet. A surge of spices: Odours Common Wealth, A Pillar of Perfume: a steaming Reech Of Aromatick Clouds: All Saving Health. Sweetness itselfe thou art: And I presume In Calling of thee Sweet, who art Perfume. But Woe is mee! who have so quick a Sent To Catch perfumes pufft out from Pincks, and Roses And other Muscadalls, as they get Vent, Out of their Mothers Wombs to bob our noses. And yet thy sweet perfume doth seldom latch My Lord, within my Mammulary Catch. Am I denos'de? or doth the Worlds ill sents Engarison my nosthrills narrow bore? Or is my smell lost in these Damps it Vents? And shall I never finde it any more? Or is it like the Hawks, or Hownds whose breed Take stincking Carrion for Perfume indeed? This is my Case. All things smell sweet to mee: Except thy sweetness, Lord. Expell these damps. Breake up this Garison: and let me see Thy Aromaticks pitching in these Camps. Oh! let the Clouds of thy sweet Vapours rise, And both my Mammularies Circumcise. Shall Spirits thus my Mammularies suck? (As Witches Elves their teats,) and draw from thee My Dear, Dear Spirit after fumes of muck? Be Dunghill Damps more sweet than Graces bee? Lord, clear these Caves. These Passes take, and keep. And in these Quarters lodge thy Odours sweet. Lord, breake thy Box of Ointment on my Head; Let thy sweet Powder powder all my hair: My Spirits let with thy perfumes be fed And make thy Odours, Lord, my nosthrills fare. My Soule shall in thy sweets then soar to thee: I'le be thy Love, thou my sweet Lord shalt bee. The Experience. Oh! that I alwayes breath'd in such an aire, As I suckt in, feeding on sweet Content! Disht up unto my Soul ev'n in that pray're Pour'de out to God over last Sacrament. What Beam of Light wrapt up my sight to finde Me neerer God than ere Came in my minde? Most strange it was! But yet more strange that shine Which filld my Soul then to the brim to spy My Nature with thy Nature all Divine Together joyn'd in Him thats Thou, and I. Flesh of my Flesh, Bone of my Bone. There's run Thy Godhead, and my Manhood in thy Son. Oh! that that Flame which thou didst on me Cast Might me enflame, and Lighten ery where. Then Heaven to me would be less at last So much of heaven I should have while here. Oh! Sweet though Short! Ile not forget the same. My neerness, Lord, to thee did me Enflame. I'le Claim my Right: Give place, ye Angells Bright. Ye further from the Godhead stande than I. My Nature is your Lord; and doth Unite Better than Yours unto the Deity. Gods Throne is first and mine is next: to you Onely the place of Waiting-men is due. Oh! that my Heart, thy Golden Harp might bee Well tun'd by Glorious Grace, that e'ry string Screw'd to the highest pitch, might unto thee All Praises wrapt in sweetest Musick bring. I praise thee, Lord, and better praise thee would If what I had, my heart might ever hold. The Return. Inamoring Rayes, thy Sparkles, Pearle of Price Impearld with Choisest Gems, their beams Display Impoysoning Sin, Guilding my Soule with Choice Rich Grace, thy Image bright, making me pray, Oh! that thou Wast on Earth below with mee Or that I was in Heaven above with thee. Thy Humane Frame, with Beauty Dapled, and In Beds of Graces pald with golden layes, Lockt to thy Holy Essence by thy hand, Yields Glances that enflame my Soul, that sayes Oh! that thou wast on Earth below with mee! Or that I was in Heaven above with thee. All Love in God, and's Properties Divine Enam'led are in thee: thy Beauties Blaze Attracts my Souls Choice golden Wyer to twine About thy Rose-sweet selfe. And therefore prayes Oh! that thou wast on Earth below with mee! Or, that I was in Heaven above with thee. A Magazeen of Love: Bright Glories blaze: Thy Shine fills Heaven with Glory; Smile Convayes Heavens Glory in my Soule, which it doth glaze All ore with amoring Glory; that she sayes, Oh! that thou wast on Earth below with mee! Or, that I was in Heaven above with thee! Heavens Golden Spout thou art where Grace most Choice Comes Spouting down from God to man of Clay. A Golden Stepping Stone to Paradise A Golden Ladder into Heaven! I'l pray Oh! that thou wast on Earth below with mee Or that I was in Heaven above with thee. Thy Service is my Freedom Pleasure, Joy, Delight, Bliss, Glory, Heaven on Earth, my Stay, In Gleams of Glory thee to glorify. But oh! my Dross and Lets. Wherefore I say Oh! that thou wast on Earth below with mee: Or that I was in Heaven above with thee. If off as Offall I be put, if I Out of thy Vineyard Work be put away: Life would be Death: my Soule would Coffin'd ly, Within my Body; and no longer pray Oh! that thou wast on Earth below with mee: But that I was in Heaven above with thee. But I've thy Pleasant Pleasant Presence had In Word, Pray're, Ordinances, Duties; nay, And in thy Graces, making me full Glad, In Faith, Hope, Charity, that I do say, That thou hast been on Earth below with mee. And I shall be in Heaven above with thee. Be thou Musician, Lord, Let me be made The well tun'de Instrument thou dost assume. And let thy Glory be my Musick plaide. Then let thy Spirit keepe my Strings in tune, Whilst thou art here on Earth below with mee Till I sing Praise in Heaven above with thee. 4. Meditation. Cant. 2.1. I am the Rose of Sharon. 22.2m [April] 1683. My Silver Chest a Sparke of Love up locks: And out will let it when I can't well Use. The gawdy World me Courts t'unlock the Box, A motion makes, where Love may pick and choose. Her Downy Bosom opes, that pedlars Stall, Of Wealth, Sports, Honours, Beauty, slickt up all. Love pausing on't, these Clayey Faces she Disdains to Court; but Pilgrims life designs, And Walkes in Gilliads Land, and there doth see The Rose of Sharon which with Beauty shines. Her Chest Unlocks; the Sparke of Love out breaths To Court this Rose: and lodgeth in its leaves. No flower in Garzia Horti shines like this: No Beauty sweet in all the World so Choice: It is the Rose of Sharon sweet, that is The Fairest Rose that Grows in Paradise. Blushes of Beauty bright, Pure White, and Red In Sweats of Glory on Each Leafe doth bed. Lord lead me into this sweet Rosy Bower: Oh! Lodge my Soul in this Sweet Rosy bed: Array my Soul with this sweet Sharon flower: Perfume me with the Odours it doth shed. Wealth, Pleasure, Beauty Spirituall will line My pretious Soul, if Sharons Rose be mine. The Blood Red Pretious Syrup of this Rose Doth all Catholicons excell what ere. Ill Humours all that do the Soule inclose When rightly usd, it purgeth out most clear. Lord purge my Soul with this Choice Syrup, and Chase all thine Enemies out of my land. The Rosy Oyle, from Sharons Rose extract Better than Palma Christi far is found. Its Gilliads Balm for Conscience when she's wrackt Unguent Apostolorum for each Wound. Let me thy Patient, thou my Surgeon bee. Lord, with thy Oyle of Roses Supple mee. No Flower there is in Paradise that grows Whose Virtues Can Consumptive Souls restore But Shugar of Roses made of Sharons Rose When Dayly usd, doth never fail to Cure. Lord let my Dwindling Soul be dayly fed With Sugar of Sharons Rose, its dayly Bread. God Chymist is, doth Sharons Rose distill. Oh! Choice Rose Water! Swim my Soul herein. Let Conscience bibble in it with her Bill. Its Cordiall, ease doth Heart burns Causd by Sin. Oyle, Syrup, Sugar, and Rose Water such. Lord, give, give, give; I cannot have too much. But, oh! alas! that such should be my need That this Brave Flower must Pluckt, stampt, squeezed bee, And boyld up in its Blood, its Spirits sheed, To make a Physick sweet, sure, safe for mee. But yet this mangled Rose rose up again And in its pristine glory, doth remain. All Sweets, and Beauties of all Flowers appeare In Sharons Rose, whose Glorious Leaves out vie In Vertue, Beauty, Sweetness, Glory Cleare, The Spangled Leaves of Heavens cleare Chrystall Sky. Thou Rose of Heaven, Glory's Blossom Cleare Open thy Rosie Leaves, and lodge mee there. My Dear-Sweet Lord, shall I thy Glory meet Lodg'd in a Rose, that out a sweet Breath breaths. What is my way to Glory made thus sweet, Strewd all along with Sharons Rosy Leaves. I'le walk this Rosy Path: World fawn, or frown And Sharons Rose shall be my Rose, and Crown. The Reflexion. Lord, art thou at the Table Head above Meat, Med'cine, sweetness, sparkling Beautys to Enamour Souls with Flaming Flakes of Love, And not my Trencher, nor my Cup o'reflow? Be n't I a bidden Guest? Oh! sweat mine Eye. Oreflow with Teares: Oh! draw thy fountains dry. Shall I not smell thy sweet, oh! Sharons Rose? Shall not mine Eye salute thy Beauty? Why? Shall thy sweet leaves their Beautious sweets upclose? As halfe ashamde my sight should on them ly? Woe's me! for this my sighs shall be in grain Offer'd on Sorrows Altar for the same. Had not my Soule's thy Conduit, Pipes stopt bin With mud, what Ravishment would'st thou Convay? Let Graces Golden Spade dig till the Spring Of tears arise, and cleare this filth away. Lord, let thy spirit raise my sighings till These Pipes my soule do with thy sweetness fill. Earth once was Paradise of Heaven below Till inkefac'd sin had it with poyson stockt And Chast this Paradise away into Heav'ns upmost Loft, and it in Glory Lockt. But thou, sweet Lord, hast with thy golden Key Unlockt the Doore, and made, a golden day. Once at thy Feast, I saw thee Pearle-like stand 'Tween Heaven, and Earth where Heavens Bright glory all In streams fell on thee, as a floodgate and, Like Sun Beams through thee on the World to Fall. Oh! sugar sweet then! my Deare sweet Lord, I see Saints Heavens-lost Happiness restor'd by thee. Shall Heaven, and Earth's bright Glory all up lie Like Sun Beams bundled in the sun, in thee? Dost thou sit Rose at Table Head, where I Do sit, and Carv'st no morsell sweet for mee? So much before, so little now! Sprindge, Lord, Thy Rosie Leaves, and me their Glee afford. Shall not thy Rose my Garden fresh perfume? Shall not thy Beauty my dull Heart assaile? Shall not thy golden gleams run through this gloom? Shall my black Velvet Mask thy fair Face Vaile? Pass o're my Faults: shine forth, bright sun: arise Enthrone thy Rosy-selfe within mine Eyes. 5. Meditation. Cant. 2.1. The Lilly of the Vallies. 2.7m [Sept.] 1683. My Blessed Lord, art thou a Lilly Flower? Oh! that my Soul thy Garden were, that so Thy bowing Head root in my Heart, and poure Might of its Seeds, that they therein might grow. Be thou my Lilly, make thou me thy knot: Be thou my Flowers, I'le be thy Flower Pot. My barren heart thy Fruitfull Vally make: Be thou my Lilly flouerishing in mee: Oh Lilly of the Vallies. For thy sake, Let me thy Vally, thou my Lilly bee. Then nothing shall me of thyselfe bereave. Thou must not me, or must thy Vally leave. How shall my Vallie's Spangling Glory spred, Thou Lilly of the Vallies Spangling There springing up? Upon thy bowing Head All Heavens bright Glory hangeth dangling. My Vally then with Blissfull Beams shall shine, Thou Lilly of the Vallys, being mine. [6.] Another Meditation at the same time. Am I thy Gold? Or Purse, Lord, for thy Wealth; Whether in mine, or mint refinde for thee? Ime counted so, but count me o're thyselfe, Lest gold washt face, and brass in Heart I bee. I Feare my Touchstone touches when I try Mee, and my Counted Gold too overly. Am I new minted by thy Stamp indeed? Mine Eyes are dim; I cannot clearly see. Be thou my Spectacles that I may read Thine Image, and Inscription stampt on mee. If thy bright Image do upon me stand I am a Golden Angell in thy hand. Lord, make my Soule thy Plate: thine Image bright Within the Circle of the same enfoile. And on its brims in golden Letters write Thy Superscription in an Holy style. Then I shall be thy Money, thou my Hord: Let me thy Angell bee, bee thou my Lord. 7. Meditation. Ps. 45.2. Grace in thy lips is poured out. 10.12m [Feb.] 1683. Thy Humane Frame, my Glorious Lord, I spy, A Golden Still with Heavenly Choice drugs filld; Thy Holy Love, the Glowing heate whereby, The Spirit of Grace is graciously distilld. Thy Mouth the Neck through which these spirits still. My Soul thy Violl make, and therewith fill. Thy Speech the Liquour in thy Vessell stands, Well ting'd with Grace a blessed Tincture, Loe, Thy Words distilld, Grace in thy Lips pourd, and, Give Graces Tinctur in them where they go. Thy words in graces tincture stilld, Lord, may The Tincture of thy Grace in me Convay. That Golden Mint of Words, thy Mouth Divine, Doth tip these Words, which by my Fall were spoild; And Dub with Gold dug out of Graces mine That they thine Image might have in them foild. Grace in thy Lips pourd out's as Liquid Gold. Thy Bottle make my Soule, Lord, it to hold. 8. Meditation. Joh. 6.51. I am the Living Bread. 8.4m [June] 1684. I kening through Astronomy Divine The Worlds bright Battlement, wherein I spy A Golden Path my Pensill cannot line, From that bright Throne unto my Threshold ly. And while my puzzled thoughts about it pore I finde the Bread of Life in't at my doore. When that this Bird of Paradise put in This Wicker Cage (my Corps) to tweedle praise Had peckt the Fruite forbad: and so did fling Away its Food; and lost its golden dayes; It fell into Celestiall Famine sore: And never could attain a morsell more. Alas! alas! Poore Bird, what wilt thou doe? The Creatures field no food for Souls e're gave. And if thou knock at Angells dores they show An Empty Barrell: they no soul bread have. Alas! Poore Bird, the Worlds White Loafe is done. And cannot yield thee here the smallest Crumb. In this sad state, Gods Tender Bowells run Out streams of Grace: And he to end all strife The Purest Wheate in Heaven, his deare-dear Son Grinds, and kneads up into this Bread of Life. Which Bread of Life from Heaven down came and stands Disht on thy Table up by Angells Hands. Did God mould up this Bread in Heaven, and bake, Which from his Table came, and to thine goeth? Doth he bespeake thee thus, This Soule Bread take. Come Eate thy fill of this thy Gods White Loafe? Its Food too fine for Angells, yet come, take And Eate thy fill. Its Heavens Sugar Cake. What Grace is this knead in this Loafe? This thing Souls are but petty things it to admire. Yee Angells, help: This fill would to the brim Heav'ns whelm'd-down Chrystall meele Bowle, yea and higher. This Bread of Life dropt in thy mouth, doth Cry. Eate, Eate me, Soul, and thou shalt never dy. 9. Meditation. Joh. 6.51. I am the Living Bread. 7.7m [Sept.] 1684. Did Ever Lord such noble house mentain, As my Lord doth? Or such a noble Table? 'T would breake the back of kings, nay, Monarchs brain To do it. Pish, the Worlds Estate's not able. I'le bet a boast with any that this Bread I eate excells what ever Caesar had. Take earth's Brightst Darlings, in whose mouths all flakes Of Lushous Sweets she hath do croude their Head, Their Spiced Cups, sweet Meats, and Sugar Cakes Are but dry Sawdust to this Living Bread. I'le pawn my part in Christ, this Dainti'st Meate, Is Gall, and Wormwood unto what I eate. The Boasting Spagyrist (Insipid Phlegm, Whose Words out strut the Sky) vaunts he hath rife The Water, Tincture, Lozenge, Gold, and Gem, Of Life itselfe. But here's the Bread of Life. I'le lay my Life, his Aurum Vitae Red Is to my Bread of Life, worse than dead head. The Dainti'st Dish of Earthly Cookery Is but to fat the body up in print. This Bread of Life doth feed the Soule, whereby Its made the Temple of Jehovah in't. I'le Venture Heav'n upon't that Low or High That eate this Living Bread shall never dy. This Bread of Life, so excellent, I see The Holy Angells doubtless would, if they Were prone unto base Envie, Envie't mee. But oh! come, tast how sweet it is. I say, I'le Wage my Soule and all therein uplaid, This is the sweetest Bread that e're God made. What wonder's here, that Bread of Life should come To feed Dead Dust? Dry Dust eate Living Bread? Yet Wonder more by far may all, and some That my Dull Heart's so dumpish when thus fed. Lord Pardon this, and feed mee all my dayes, With Living Bread to thy Eternall Prayse. 10. Meditation. Joh. 6.55. My Blood is Drinke indeed. 26.8m [Oct.] 1684. Stupendious Love! All Saints Astonishment! Bright Angells are black Motes in this Suns Light. Heav'ns Canopy the Paintice to Gods tent Can't Cover't neither with its breadth, nor height. Its Glory doth all Glory else out run, Beams of bright Glory to't are motes i'th'sun. My Soule had Caught an Ague, and like Hell Her thirst did burn: she to each spring did fly, But this bright blazing Love did spring a Well Of Aqua-Vitae in the Deity, Which on the top of Heav'ns high Hill out burst And down came running thence t'allay my thirst. But how it came, amazeth all Communion. Gods onely Son doth hug Humanity, Into his very person. By which Union His Humane Veans its golden gutters ly. And rather than my Soule should dy by thirst, These Golden Pipes, to give me drink, did burst. This Liquour brew'd, thy sparkling Art Divine Lord, in thy Chrystall Vessells did up tun, (Thine Ordinances,) which all Earth o're shine Set in thy rich Wine Cellars out to run. Lord, make thy Butlar draw, and fill with speed My Beaker full: for this is drink indeed. Whole Buts of this blesst Nectar shining stand Lockt up with Saph'rine Taps, whose splendid Flame Too bright do shine for brightest Angells hands To touch, my Lord. Do thou untap the same. Oh! make thy Chrystall Buts of Red Wine bleed Into my Chrystall Glass this Drink-Indeed. How shall I praise thee then? My blottings Jar And wrack my Rhymes to pieces in thy praise. Thou breath'st thy Vean still in my Pottinger To lay my thirst, and fainting spirits raise. Thou makest Glory's Chiefest Grape to bleed Into my cup: And this is Drink-Indeed. Nay, though I make no pay for this Red Wine, And scarce do say I thank-ye-for't; strange thing! Yet were thy silver skies my Beer bowle fine I finde my Lord, would fill it to the brim. Then make my life, Lord, to thy praise proceed For thy rich blood, which is my Drink-Indeed. 11. Meditation. Isai. 25.6. A Feast of Fat things. 31.3m [Mar.] 1685. A Deity of Love Incorporate My Lord, lies in thy Flesh, in Dishes stable Ten thousand times more rich than golden Plate In golden Services upon thy Table, To feast thy People with. What Feast is this! Where richest Love lies Cookt in e'ry Dish? A Feast, a Feast, a Feast of Spiced Wine Of Wines upon the Lees, refined well Of Fat things full of Marrow, things Divine Of Heavens blest Cookery which doth excell. The Smell of Lebanon, and Carmell sweet Are Earthly damps unto this Heavenly reech. This Shew-Bread Table all of Gold with white Fine Table Linen of Pure Love, 's ore spred And Courses in Smaragdine Chargers bright Of Choicest Dainties Paradise e're bred. Where in each Grace like Dainty Sippits lie Oh! brave Embroderies of sweetest joy! Oh! what a Feast is here? This Table might Make brightest Angells blush to sit before. Then pain my Soule! Why wantst thou appitite? Oh! blush to thinke thou hunger dost no more. There never was a feast more rich than this: The Guests that Come hereto shall swim in bliss. Hunger, and Thirst my Soule, goe Fasting Pray, Untill thou hast an Appitite afresh: And then come here; here is a feast will pay Thee for the same with all Deliciousness. Untap Loves Golden Cask, Love run apace: And o're this Feast Continually say Grace. 12. Meditation. Isai. 63.1. Glorious in his Apparell. 19.5m [July] 1685. This Quest rapt at my Eares broad golden Doores Who's this that comes from Edom in this shine In Died Robes from Bozrah? this more ore All Glorious in's Apparrell; all Divine? Then through that Wicket rusht this buss there gave, Its I that right do speake mighty to save. I threw through Zions Lattice then an Eye Which spide one like a lump of Glory pure Nay, Cloaths of gold button'd with pearls do ly Like Rags, or shooclouts unto his he wore. Heavens Curtains blancht with Sun, and Starrs of Light Are black as sackcloath to his Garments bright. One shining sun guilding the skies with Light Benights all Candles with their flaming Blaze So doth the Glory of this Robe benight Ten thousand suns at once ten thousand wayes. For e'ry thrid therein's dy'de with the shine Of All, and Each the Attributes Divine. The sweetest breath, the sweetest Violet Rose, or Carnation ever did gust out Is but a Foist to that Perfume beset In thy Apparell steaming round about: But is this so? My Peuling soul then pine In Love untill this Lovely one be thine. Pluck back the Curtains, back the Window Shutts: Through Zions Agate Window take a view; How Christ in Pinckted Robes from Bozrah puts Comes Glorious in's Apparell forth to Wooe. Oh! if his Glory ever kiss thine Eye, Thy Love will soon Enchanted bee thereby. Then Grieve, my Soul, thy vessell is so small And holds no more for such a Lovely Hee. That strength's so little, Love scarce acts at all. That sight's so dim, doth scarce him lovely see. Grieve, grieve, my Soul, thou shouldst so pimping bee, Now such a Price is here presented thee. All sight's too little sight enough to make All strength's too little Love enough to reare All Vessells are too small to hold or take Enough Love up for such a Lovely Deare. How little to this Little's then thy all. For Him whose Beauty saith all Love's too small? My Lovely One, I fain would love thee much But all my Love is none at all I see, Oh! let thy Beauty give a glorious tuch Upon my Heart, and melt to Love all mee. Lord melt me all up into Love for thee Whose Loveliness excells what love can bee. 13. Meditation. Col. 2.3. All the Treasures of Wisdom. 27.7m [Sept.] 1685. Thou Glory Darkning Glory, with thy Flame Should all Quaint Metaphors teem ev'ry Bud Of Sparkling Eloquence upon the same It would appeare as dawbing pearls with mud. Nay Angells Wits are Childish tricks, and like The Darksom night unto thy Lightsom Light. Oh! Choicest Cabbinet, more Choice than gold Or Wealthist Pearles Wherein all Pearls of Price All Treasures of Choice Wisdom manifold Inthroned reign. Thou Cabinet most Choice Not scant to hold, not staind with cloudy geere The Shining Sun of Wisdom bowling there. Thou Shining Golden Lanthorn with pain'd Lights Of Chrystall cleare, thy golden Candles flame, Makes such a Shine, as doth the Sun benights. Its but a Smoaky vapor to the Same. All Wisdom knead into a Chrystall Ball, Shines like the Sun in thee, its azure Hall. Thou rowling Eye of Light, to thee are sent All Dazzling Beams of Shine the Heavens distill. All Wisdoms Troops do quarter in thy Tents And all her Treasures Cabin in thy tills. Be thou, Lord, mine: then I shall Wealthy bee, Enricht with Wisdoms Treasures, Stoughd in thee. That little Grain within my golden Bowle, Should it attempt to poise thy Talent cleare, It would inoculate into my Soule, As illookt Impudence as ever were. But, loe, it stands amaizd, and doth adore, Thy Magazeen of Wisdom, and thy Store. 14. 15. Meditations. Heb. 4.14. A Great High Priest. 14.9m [Nov.] 1685. 10.11m [Jan.] 1685. Raptures of Love, surprizing Loveliness, That burst through Heavens all, in Rapid Flashes, Glances guilt o're with smiling Comliness! (Wonders do palefac'd stand smit by such dashes). Glory itselfe Heartsick of Love doth ly Bleeding out Love o're Loveless mee, and dy. Might I a glance of this bright brightness shew; Se it in him who gloriously is dresst: A Gold Silk Stomacher of Purple, blew Blancht o're with Orient Pearles being on his Breast: And all his Robes being answerable, but This glory seen, to that unseen's a Smut. Yea, Beauteous Hee, in all his Glory stands, Tendring himselfe to God, and Man where hee Doth Justice thus bespeake, Hold out thy hands: Come, take thy Penworths now for mine of mee. I'le pay the fine that thou seest meet to set Upon their Heads: I'le dy to cleare their debts. Out Rampant Justice steps in Sparkling White, Him rends in twain, who on her Altar lies A Lump of Glory flaming in her bright Devouring Flames, to be my Sacrifice Untill her Fire goes out well Satisfide: And then he rose in Glory to abide. To Heav'n went he, and in his bright Throne sits At Gods right hand pleading poor Sinners Cases. With Golden Wedges he of Promise, splits The Heav'ns ope, to shew what Glory 'braces. And in its thickness thus with Arms extended, Calls, come, come here, and ever be befriended. Frost bitten Love, Frozen Affections! Blush; What icy Chrystall mountain lodge you in? What Wingless Wishes, Hopes pinfeatherd tush! Sore Hooft Desires hereof do in you spring? Oh hard black Kirnell at the Coare! not pant? Encastled in an heart of Adamant! What strange Congealed Heart have I when I Under such Beauty shining like the Sun Able to make Frozen Affection fly, And Icikles of Frostbitt Love to run. Yea, and Desires lockt in an heart of Steel Or Adamant, breake prison, nothing feel. Lord may thy Priestly Golden Oares but make A rowing in my Lumpish Heart, thou'lt see My Chilly Numbd Affections Charm, and break Out in a rapid Flame of Love to thee. Yea, they unto thyselfe will fly in flocks When thy Warm Sun my frozen Lake unlocks. Be thou my High Priest, Lord; and let my name Ly in some Grave dug in these Pearly rocks Upon thy Ephods Shoulder piece, like flame Or graved in thy Breast Plate-Gem: brave Knops. Thou'lt then me beare before thy Fathers Throne Rowld up in Folds of Glory of thine own. One of these Gems I beg, Lord, that so well Begrace thy Breast Plate, and thy Ephod cleaver To stud my Crown therewith: or let me dwell Among their sparkling, glancing Shades for ever. I'st then be deckt in glory bright to sing With Angells, Hallelujahs to my King. 16. Meditation. Lu. 7.16. A Greate Prophet is risen up. 6.1m [Mar.] 1685/6. Leafe Gold, Lord of thy Golden Wedge o'relaid My Soul at first, thy Grace in e'ry part Whose peart, fierce Eye thou such a Sight hadst made Whose brightsom beams could break into thy heart Till thy Curst Foe had with my Fist mine Eye Dasht out, and did my Soule Unglorify. I cannot see, nor Will thy Will aright. Nor see to waile my Woe, my loss and hew Nor all the Shine in all the Sun can light My Candle, nor its Heate my Heart renew. See, waile, and Will thy Will, I must, or must From Heavens sweet Shine to Hells hot flame be thrust. Grace then Conceald in God himselfe, did rowle Even Snow Ball like into a Sunball Shine And nestles all its beams buncht in thy Soule My Lord, that sparkle in Prophetick Lines. Oh! Wonder more than Wonderfull! this Will Lighten the Eye which Sight Divine did spill. What art thou, Lord, this Ball of Glory bright? A Bundle of Celestiall Beams up bound In Graces band fixt in Heavens topmost height Pouring thy golden Beams thence, Circling round Which shew thy Glory, and thy glories Way And ery Where will make Celestiall Day. Lord let thy Golden Beams pierce through mine Eye And leave therein an Heavenly Light to glaze My Soule with glorious Grace all o're, whereby I may have Sight, and Grace in mee may blaze. Lord ting my Candle at thy Burning Rayes, To give a gracious Glory to thy Prayse. Thou Lightning Eye, let some bright Beames of thine Stick in my Soul, to light and liven it: Light, Life, and Glory, things that are Divine; I shall be grac'd withall for glory fit. My Heart then stufft with Grace, Light, Life, and Glee I'le sacrifice in Flames of Love to thee. 17. Meditation. Rev. 19.16. King of Kings. 13.4m [June] 1686. A King, a King, a King indeed, a King Writh up in Glory! Glorie's glorious Throne Is glorifide by him, presented him. And all the Crowns of Glory are his own. A King, Wise, Just, Gracious, Magnificent. Kings unto him are Whiffles, Indigent. What is his Throne all Glory? Crown all Gay? Crown all of Brightest Shine of Glory's Wealth? This is a Lisp of Non-sense. I should say, He is the Throne, and Crown of Glory 'tselfe. Should Sun beams come to gilde his glory they Would be as 'twere to gild the Sun with Clay. My Phancys in a Maze, my thoughts agast, Words in an Extasy; my Telltale Tongue Is tonguetide, and my Lips are padlockt fast To see thy Kingly Glory in to throng. I can, yet cannot tell this Glory just, In Silence bury't, must not, yet I must. This King of King's Brave Kingdom doth Consist Of Glorious Angells, and Blesst Saints alone Or Chiefly. Where all Beams of Glory twist, Together, beaming from, lead to his throne Which Beams his Grace Coiles in a Wreath to Crown His, in the End in Endless Bright Renown. His Two-Edg'd Sword, not murdering Steel so base, Is made of Righteousness, unspotted, bright Imbellisht o're with overflowing Grace Doth killing, Cure the Sinner, kills Sin right. Makes milkwhite Righteousness, and Grace to reign, And Satan and his Cubs with Sin ly slain. Were all Kings deckt with Sparkling Crowns, and arm'd With flaming Swords, and firy Courage traind And led under their King Abaddon, Charmd In battell out against their foes disdaind One smiling look of this bright Shine would fell Them and their Crowns of Glory all to Hell. Thou art my king: let me not be thy Shame. Thy Law my Rule: my Life thy Life in Mee. Thy Grace my Badge: my Glory bright thy Name. I am resolv'd to live and dy with thee. Keep mee, thou King of Glory on Record. Thou art my King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. 18. Meditation. Isai. 52.14. His Vissage was marr'd more than any man. 29.6m [Aug.] 1686. Astonisht stand, my Soule; why dost not start At this surprizing Sight shewn here below? Oh! let the twitch made by my bouncing Heart Gust from my breast this Enterjection, Oh! A Sight so Horrid, sure its Mercies Wonder Rocks rend not at't, nor Heavens split asunder. Souls Charg'd with Sin, Discharge at God, beside Firld up in Guilt, Wrapt in Sins Slough, and Slime. Wills wed to Wickedness, Hearts Stonifide Flinty Affections, Conscience Chalybdine Flooding the World with Horrid Crimes, arise Daring Almighty God Contemptuouswise. Hence Vengeance rose with her fierce Troops in Buff, Soul-piercing Plagues, Heart-Aching Griefs, and Groans, Woes Pickled in Revenges Powdering Trough: Pain fetching forth their Proofs out of the boanes. Doth all in Flames of Fire surround them so Which they can ne're o'recome, nor undergo. In this sad Plight the richest Beauty Cleare That th'bravest Flower, that bud was big with, wore, Did glorify those Cheeks, whose Vissage were Marr'd more than any mans, and Form spoild more. Oh! Beauty beautifull, not toucht with vice! The fairest Flower in all Gods Paradise! Stept in, and in its Glory 'Counters all. And in the Belly of this Dismall Cloud, Of Woes in Pickle is gulpht up, whose Gall He dranke up quite. Whose Claws his Face up plow'd. Yet in these Furrows sprang the brightest Shine That Glory's Sun could make, or Love Enshrine. Then Vengeance's Troops are routed, Pickled Woe Heart-aching Griefes, Pains plowing to the boanes, Soul piercing Plagues, all Venom do foregoe. The Curse now Cures, though th'Griefe procureth groans. As th'Angry Bee doth often lose her Sting, The Law was Cursless made in Cursing him. And now his shining Love beams out its rayes My Soul, upon thy Heart to thaw the same: To animate th'Affections till they blaze; To free from Guilt, and from Sins Slough, and Shame. Open thy Casement wide, let Glory in, To Guild thy Heart to be an Hall for him. My Breast, be thou the ringing Virginalls: Ye mine Affections, their sweet Golden Strings, My Panting Heart, be thou for Stops, and Falls: Lord, let thy quick'ning Beams dance o're the Pins. Then let thy Spirit this sweet note resume, altaschath michtam, in Seraphick Tune. 19. Meditation. Phil. 2.9. God hath highly exalted him. 14.9m [Nov.] 1686. Looke till thy Looks look Wan, my Soule; here's ground. The Worlds bright Eye's dash't out: Day-Light so brave Bemidnighted; the sparkling sun, palde round With flouring Rayes lies buri'de in its grave The Candle of the World blown out, down fell. Life knockt a head by Death: Heaven by Hell. Alas! this World all filld up to the brim With Sins, Deaths, Divills, Crowding men to Hell. For whose reliefe Gods milkwhite Lamb stept in Whom those Curst Imps did worry, flesh, and fell. Tread under foot, did Clap their Wings and so Like Dunghill Cocks over their Conquourd, Crow. Brave Pious Fraud; as if the Setting Sun: Dropt like a Ball of Fire into the Seas, And so went out. But to the East come, run: You'l meet the morn Shrinde with its flouring Rayes. This Lamb in laying of these Lyons dead; Drank of the brooke: and so lift up his Head. Oh! sweet, sweet joy! These Rampant Fiends befoold: They made their Gall his Winding sheete; although They of the Heart-ach dy must, or be Coold With Inflamation of the Lungs, they know. He's Cancelling the Bond, and making Pay: And Ballancing Accounts: its Reckoning day. See, how he from the Counthouse shining went, In Flashing Folds of Burnisht Glory, and Dasht out all Curses from the Covenant Hath Justices Acquittance in his hand Pluckt out Deaths Sting, the Serpents Head did mall The Bars and Gates of Hell he brake down all. The Curse thus Lodgd within his Flesh, and Cloyde, Can't run from him to his, so much he gave. And like a Gyant he awoke, beside, The Sun of Righteousness rose out of's Grave. And setting Foot upon its neck I sing Grave, where's thy Victory? Death, Where's thy Sting? 20. Meditation. Phil. 2.9. God hath highly Exalted him. 9.11m [Jan.] 1686. View all ye eyes above, this sight which flings Seraphick Phancies in Chill Raptures high, A Turffe of Clay, and yet bright Glories King From dust to Glory Angell-like to fly. A Mortall Clod immortalizde, behold, Flyes through the Skies swifter than Angells could. Upon the Wings he of the Winde rode in His Bright Sedan, through all the Silver Skies And made the Azure Cloud his Charriot bring Him to the Mountain of Celestiall joyes. The Prince o'th'Aire durst not an Arrow spend While through his Realm his Charriot did ascend. He did not in a Fiery Charriot's Shine, And Whirlewinde, like Elias upward goe. But th'golden Ladders Jasper rounds did climbe Unto the Heavens high from Earth below. Each step trod on a Golden Stepping Stone Of Deity unto his very Throne. Methinks I see Heavens sparkling Courtiers fly, In flakes of Glory down him to attend: And heare Heart Cramping notes of Melody, Surround his Charriot as it did ascend Mixing their Musick making e'ry string More to inravish as they this tune sing. God is Gone up with a triumphant Shout The Lord with sounding Trumpets melodies. Sing Praise, sing Praise, sing Praise, sing Praises out, Unto our King sing praise seraphickwise. Lift up your Heads ye lasting Doore they sing And let the King of Glory Enter in. Art thou ascended up on high, my Lord, And must I be without thee here below? Art thou the sweetest Joy the Heavens afford? Oh! that I with thee was! what shall I do? Should I pluck Feathers from an Angells Wing, They could not waft me up to thee my King. Lend mee thy Wings, my Lord, I'st fly apace. My Soules Arms stud with thy strong Quills, true Faith, My Quills then Feather with thy Saving Grace, My Wings will take the Winde thy Word displai'th. Then I shall fly up to thy glorious Throne With my strong Wings whose Feathers are thine own. 21. Meditation. Phil. 2.9. God hath Highly Exalted Him. 13.1m [Mar.] 1686/7. What Glory's this, my Lord? Should one small Point Of one small Ray of't touch my Heart 'twould spring Such joy as would an Adamant unjoynt If in't, and tare it, to get out and sing. T'run on Heroick golden Feet, and raise Heart Ravishing Tunes, Curld with Celestiall praise. Oh! Bright! Bright thing! I fain would something say: Lest Silence should indict me. Yet I feare To say a Syllable lest at thy day I be presented for my Tattling here. Course Phancy, Ragged Faculties, alas! And Blunted Tongue don't Suit: Sighs Soile the Glass. Yet shall my mouth stand ope, and Lips let run Out gliding Eloquence on each light thing? And shall I gag my mouth, and ty my Tongue, When such bright Glory glorifies within? That makes my Heart leape, dancing to thy Lute? And shall my tell tale tongue become a Mute? Lord spare I pray, though my attempts let fall A slippery Verse upon thy Royall Glory. I'le bring unto thine Altar th'best of all My Flock affords. I have no better Story. I'le at thy Glory my dark Candle light: Not to descry the Sun, but use by night. A Golden Throne whose Banisters are Pearles, And Pomills Choicest Gems: Carbuncle-Stayes Studded with Pretious Stones, Carv'd with rich Curles Of Polisht Art, sending out flashing Rayes, Would him surround with Glory, thron'de therein. Yet this is to thy Throne a dirty thing. Oh! Glorious Sight! Loe, How Bright Angells stand Waiting with Hat in hand on Him alone That is Enthron'de, indeed at Gods right hand: Gods Heart itselfe being his Happy Throne. The Glory that doth from this Person fall, Fills Heaven with Glory, else there's none at all. 22. Meditation. Phil. 2.9. God hath Highly Exalted him. 12.4m [June] 1687. When thy Bright Beams, my Lord, do strike mine Eye, Methinkes I then could truely Chide out right My Hide bound Soule that stands so niggardly That scarce a thought gets glorified by't. My Quaintest Metaphors are ragged Stuff, Making the Sun seem like a Mullipuff. Its my desire, thou shouldst be glorifi'de: But when thy Glory shines before mine eye, I pardon Crave, lest my desire be Pride. Or bed thy Glory in a Cloudy Sky. The Sun grows wan; and Angells palefac'd shrinke, Before thy Shine, which I besmeere with Inke. But shall the Bird sing forth thy Praise, and shall The little Bee present her thankfull Hum? But I who see thy shining Glory fall Before mine Eyes, stand Blockish, Dull, and Dumb? Whether I speake, or speechless stand, I spy, I faile thy Glory: therefore pardon Cry. But this I finde; My Rhymes do better suite Mine own Dispraise than tune forth praise to thee. Yet being Chid, whether Consonant, or Mute, I force my Tongue to tattle, as you see. That I thy glorious Praise may Trumpet right, Be thou my Song, and make Lord, mee thy Pipe. This shining Sky will fly away apace, When thy bright Glory splits the same to make Thy Majesty a Pass, whose Fairest Face Too foule a Path is for thy Feet to take. What Glory then, shall tend thee through the Sky Draining the Heaven much of Angells dry? What Light then flame will in thy Judgment Seate, 'Fore which all men, and angells shall appeare? How shall thy Glorious Righteousness them treate, Rend'ring to each after his Works done here? Then Saints With Angells thou wilt glorify: And burn Lewd Men, and Divells Gloriously. One glimps, my Lord, of thy bright Judgment day, And Glory piercing through, like fiery Darts, All Divells, doth me make for Grace to pray, For filling Grace had I ten thousand Hearts. I'de through ten Hells to see thy Judgment Day Wouldst thou but guild my Soule with thy bright Ray. 23. Meditation. Cant. 4.8. My Spouse. 21.6m [Aug.] 1687. Would God I in that Golden City were, With Jaspers Walld, all garnisht, and made swash, With Pretious Stones, whose Gates are Pearles most cleare And Street Pure Gold, like to transparent Glass. That my dull Soule, might be inflamde to see How Saints and Angells ravisht are in Glee. Were I but there, and could but tell my Story, 'Twould rub those Walls of Pretious Stones more bright: And glaze those Gates of Pearle, with brighter Glory; And pave the golden Street with greater light. 'Twould in fresh Raptures Saints, and Angells fling. But I poore Snake Crawl here, scarce mudwalld in. May my Rough Voice, and my blunt Tongue but spell My Tale (for tune they can't) perhaps there may Some Angell catch an end of't up, and tell In Heaven, when he doth return that way, He'l make thy Palace, Lord, all over ring, With it in Songs, thy Saint, and Angells sing. I know not how to speak't, it is so good: Shall Mortall, and Immortall marry? nay, Man marry God? God be a Match for Mud? The King of Glory Wed a Worm? mere Clay? This is the Case. The Wonder too in Bliss. Thy Maker is thy Husband. Hearst thou this? My Maker, he my Husband? Oh! strange joy! If Kings wed Worms, and Monarchs Mites wed should, Glory spouse Shame, a Prince a Snake or Fly An Angell Court an Ant, all Wonder would. Let such wed Worms, Snakes, Serpents, Divells, Flyes. Less Wonder than the Wedden in our Eyes. I am to Christ more base, than to a King A Mite, Fly, Worm, Ant, Serpent, Divell is, Or Can be, being tumbled all in Sin, And shall I be his Spouse? How good is this? It is too good to be declar'de to thee. But not too good to be believ'de by mee. Yet to this Wonder, this is found in mee, I am not onely base but backward Clay, When Christ doth Wooe: and till his Spirit bee His Spokes man to Compell me I deny. I am so base and Froward to him, Hee Appears as Wonders Wonder, wedding mee. Seing, Dear Lord, its thus, thy Spirit take And send thy Spokes man, to my Soul, I pray. Thy Saving Grace my Wedden Garment make: Thy Spouses Frame into my Soul Convay. I then shall be thy Bride Espousd by thee And thou my Bridesgroom Deare Espousde shalt bee. 24. Meditation. Eph. 2.18. Through him we haveâan Accessâunto the Father. 6.9m [Nov.] 1687. Was there a Palace of Pure Gold, all Ston'de And pav'de with Pearles, whose Gates Rich Jaspers were, And Throne a Carbuncle, whose King Enthronde Sat on a Cushion all of Sunshine Cleare; Whose Crown a Bunch of Sun Beams was: I should Prize such as in his favour shrine me Would. Thy Milke white Hand, my Glorious Lord, doth this: It opes this Gate, and me Conducts into This Golden Palace whose rich Pavement is Of Pretious Pearles: and to this King also. Thus Thron'de, and Crown'd: whose Words are 'bellisht all With brighter Beams, than e're the Sun let fall. But oh! Poore mee, thy sluggish Servant, I More blockish than a block, as blockhead, stand. Though mine Affections Quick as Lightning fly On toys, they Snaile like move to kiss thy hand. My Coal-black doth thy Milke white hand avoide, That would above the Milky Way me guide. What aim'st at, Lord? that I should be so Cross. My minde is Leaden in thy Golden Shine. Though all o're Spirit, when this dirty Dross Doth touch it with its smutting leaden lines. What shall an Eagle t'catch a Fly thus run? Or Angell Dive after a Mote ith'Sun? What Folly's this? I fain would take, I thinke, Vengeance upon myselfe: But I Confess, I can't. Mine Eyes, Lord, shed no Tears but inke. My handy Works, are Words, and Wordiness. Earth's Toyes ware Knots of my Affections, nay, Though from thy Glorious Selfe they're Stoole away. Oh! that my heart was made thy Golden Box Full of Affections, and of Love Divine Knit all in Tassles, and in True-Love Knots, To garnish o're this Worthy Worke of thine. This Box and all therein more rich than Gold, In sacred Flames, I to thee offer would. With thy rich Tissue my poore Soule array: And lead me to thy Fathers House above. Thy Graces Storehouse make my Soule I pray. Thy Praise shall then ware Tassles of my Love. If thou Conduct mee in thy Fathers Wayes, I'le be the Golden Trumpet of thy Praise. 25. Meditation. Eph. 5.27. A Glorious Church. 22.11m [Jan.] 1687. Why should my Bells, which Chime thy Praise, when thou My Shew-Bread, on thy Table wast, my King, Their Clappers, or their Bell-ropes want even now? Or those that can thy Changes sweetly ring? What is a Scar-Fire broken out? No, no. The Bells would backward ring if it was so. Its true: and I do all things backward run, Poor Pillard I have a sad tale to tell: My soule starke nakt, rowld all in mire, undone. Thy Bell may tole my passing Peale to Hell. None in their Winding sheet more naked stay Nor Dead than I. Hence oh! the Judgment Day. When I behold some Curious Piece of Art, Or Pritty Bird, Flower, Star, or Shining Sun, Poure out o'reflowing Glory: oh! my Heart Achs seing how my thoughts in Snick-Snarls run. But all this Glory to my Lord's a spot While I instead of any, am all blot. But, my sweet Lord, what glorious robes are those That thou hast brought out of thy Grave for thine? They do outshine the Sun-Shine, Grace the Rose. I leape for joy to thinke, shall these be mine? Such are, as waite upon thee in thy Wars, Cloathd with the Sun, and Crowned with twelve Stars. Dost thou adorn some thus, and why not mee? Ile not believe it. Lord, thou art my Chiefe. Thou me Commandest to believe in thee. I'l not affront thee thus with Unbeliefe. Lord, make my Soule Obedient: and when so, Thou saist Believe, make it reply, I do. I fain the Choicest Love my soule Can get, Would to thy Gracious selfe a Gift present But cannot now unscrew Loves Cabbinet. Say not this is a Niggards Complement. For seing it is thus I choose now rather To send thee th'Cabbinet, and Pearle together. 26. Meditation. Act. 5.31. To GiveâForgiveness of Sins. 15.1m [Mar.] 1688. My Noble Lord, thy Nothing Servant I Am for thy sake out with my heart, that holds, So little Love for such a Lord: I Cry How should I be but angry thus to see My Heart so hidebound in her Acts to thee? Thou art a Golden Theame: but I am lean, A Leaden Oritor upon the same. Thy Golden Web excells my Dozie Beam: Whose Linsy-Wolsy Loom deserves thy blame. Its all defild, unbiasst too by Sin: An hearty Wish for thee's scarce shot therein. It pitties mee who pitty Cannot show, That such a Worthy Theame abusd should bee. I am undone, unless thy Pardons doe Undoe my Sin I did, undoing mee. My Sins are greate, and grieveous ones, therefore Carbuncle Mountains can't wipe out their Score. But thou, my Lord, dost a Free Pardon bring. Thou giv'st Forgiveness: yet my heart through Sin, Hath naught but naught to file thy Gift up in. An hurden Haump doth Chafe a Silken Skin. Although I pardons beg, I scarce can see, When thou giv'st pardons, I give praise to thee. O bad at best! what am I then at worst? I want a Pardon: and when pardon'd, want A Thankfull Heart: Both which thou dost disburst. Giv'st both, or neither: for which Lord I pant. Two such good things at once! methinks I could Avenge my heart, lest it should neither hold. Lord tap mine Eyes, seing such Grace in thee, So little doth affect my Graceless Soule. And take my teares in lue of thanks of mee, New make my heart: then take it for thy tole. Thy Pardons then will make my heart to sing Its Michtam-David: With sweet joy Within. 27. Meditation. Col. 1.19. In Him should all Fulness Dwell. 1.5m [July] 1688. Oh! Wealthy Theam! Oh! Feeble Phancy: I Must needs admire, when I recall to minde, That's Fulness, This it's Emptiness, though spy I have no Flowring Brain thereto inclinde. My Damps do out my fire. I cannot, though I would Admire, finde heate enough thereto. What shall I say? Such rich rich Fullness would Make stammering Tongues speake smoothly, and Enshrine The Dumb mans mouth with Silver Streams like gold Of Eloquence making the Aire to Chime. Yet I am Tonguetide stupid, sensless stand, And Drier drain'd than is my pen I hand. Oh! Wealthy Box: more Golden far than Gold A Case more Worth than Wealth: a richer Delph, Than Rubies; Cabbinet, than Pearles here told A Purse more glittering than Glory 'tselfe A Golden Store House of all Fulness: Shelfe, Of Heavenly Plate. All Fulness in thyselfe. Oh! Godhead Fulness! There doth in thee flow All Wisdoms Fulness; Fulness of all Strength: Of Justice, Truth, Love, Holiness also And Graces Fulness to its upmost length Do dwell in thee. Yea and thy Fathers Pleasure. Thou art their Cabbinet, and they thy Treasure. All Office Fulness with all Office Gifts Imbossed are in thee, Whereby thy Grace, Doth treat both God, and Man, bringst up by hifts Black Sinner and White Justice to imbrace. Making the Glory of Gods Justice shine: And making Sinners to Gods glory Climbe. All Graces Fulness dwells in thee, from Whom The Golden Pipes of all Convayance ly, Through which Grace to our Clayie Panchins Come. Fullness of Beauty, and Humanity. Oh! Glorious Flow're, Glory, and Sweetness splice, In thee to Grace, and sweeten Paradise! But, oh! the Fathers Love! herein most vast! Angells engrave't in brightest Marble, t'see This Flower that in his Bosom sticks so fast, Stuck in the Bosom of such stuffe as wee That both his Purse, and all his Treasure thus, Should be so full, and freely sent to us. Were't not more than my heart can hold, or hord, Or than my Tongue can tell; I thus would pray, Let him in Whom all Fulness Dwells, dwell, Lord Within my Heart: this Treasure therein lay. I then shall sweetly tune thy Praise, When hee In Whom all Fulness dwells, doth dwell in mee. 28. Meditation. Joh. 1.16. Of His Fulness wee all receive: and Graceâ 2.7m [Sept.] 1688. When I Lord, send some Bits of Glory home, (For Lumps I lack) my Messenger, I finde, Bewildred, lose his Way being alone In my befogg'd Dark Phancy, Clouded minde. Thy Bits of Glory packt in Shreds of Praise My Messenger doth lose, losing his Wayes. Lord Cleare the Coast: and let thy sweet sun shine. That I may better speed a second time: Oh! fill my Pipkin with thy Blood red Wine: I'l drinke thy Health: To pledge thee is no Crime. Although I but an Earthen Vessell bee Convay some of thy Fulness into mee. Thou, thou my Lord, art full, top full of Grace, The Golden Sea of Grace: Whose springs thence come, And Pretious Drills, boiling in ery place. Untap thy Cask, and let my Cup Catch some. Although its in an Earthen Vessells Case, Let it no Empty Vessell be of Grace. Let thy Choice Caske, shed, Lord, into my Cue A Drop of Juyce presst from thy Noble Vine. My Bowl is but an Acorn Cup, I sue But for a Drop: this will not empty thine. Although I'me in an Earthen Vessells place, My Vessell make a Vessell, Lord, of Grace. My Earthen Vessell make thy Font also: And let thy Sea my Spring of Grace in't raise. Spring up oh Well. My Cup with Grace make flow. Thy Drops will on my Vessell ting thy Praise. I'l sing this Song, when I these Drops Embrace. My Vessell now's a Vessell of thy Grace. 29. Meditation. Joh. 20.17. My Father, and your Father, to my God, and your God. 11.9m [Nov.] 1688. My shattred Phancy stole away from mee, (Wits run a Wooling over Edens Parke) And in Gods Garden saw a golden Tree, Whose Heart was All Divine, and gold its barke. Whose glorious limbs and fruitfull branches strong With Saints, and Angells bright are richly hung. Thou! thou! my Deare-Deare Lord, art this rich Tree The Tree of Life Within Gods Paradise. I am a Withred Twig, dri'de fit to bee A Chat Cast in thy fire, Writh off by Vice. Yet if thy Milke white-Gracious Hand will take mee And grafft mee in this golden stock, thou'lt make mee. Thou'lt make me then its Fruite, and Branch to spring. And though a nipping Eastwinde blow, and all Hells Nymps with spite their Dog's sticks thereat ding To Dash the Grafft off, and it's fruits to fall, Yet I shall stand thy Grafft, and Fruits that are Fruits of the Tree of Life thy Grafft shall beare. I being grafft in thee there up do stand In us Relations all that mutuall are. I am thy Patient, Pupill, Servant, and Thy Sister, Mother, Doove, Spouse, Son, and Heire. Thou art my Priest, Physician, Prophet, King, Lord, Brother, Bridegroom, Father, Ev'ry thing. I being grafft in thee am graffted here Into thy Family, and kindred Claim To all in Heaven, God, Saints, and Angells there. I thy Relations my Relations name. Thy Father's mine, thy God my God, and I With Saints, and Angells draw Affinity. My Lord, what is it that thou dost bestow? The Praise on this account fills up, and throngs Eternity brimfull, doth overflow The Heavens vast with rich Angelick Songs. How should I blush? how Tremble at this thing, Not having yet my Gam-Ut, learnd to sing. But, Lord, as burnish't Sun Beams forth out fly Let Angell-Shine forth in my Life out flame, That I may grace thy gracefull Family And not to thy Relations be a Shame. Make mee thy Grafft, be thou my Golden Stock. Thy Glory then I'le make my fruits and Crop. 30. Meditation. 2 Cor. 5.17.âHe is a New Creature. 6.11m [Jan.] 1688. The Daintiest Draught thy Pensill ever Drew: The finest vessell, Lord, thy fingers fram'de: The statelist Palace Angells e're did view, Under thy Hatch betwixt Decks here Contain'd Broke, marred, spoild, undone, Defild doth ly In Rubbish ruinde by thine Enemy. What Pittie's this? Oh Sunshine Art! What Fall? Thou that more Glorious wast than glories Wealth! More Golden far than Gold! Lord, on whose Wall Thy scutchons hung, the Image of thyselfe! Its ruinde, and must rue, though Angells should To hold it up heave while their Heart Strings hold. But yet thou stem of Davids stock when dry And shrivled held, although most green was lopt Whose sap a sovereign Sodder is, whereby The breach repared is in which its dropt. Oh Gracious Twig! thou Cut off? bleed rich juyce T'Cement the Breach, and Glories shine reduce? Oh Lovely One! how doth thy Loveliness Beam through the Chrystall Casements of the Eyes Of Saints, and Angells sparkling Flakes of Fresh Heart Ravishing Beauty, filling up their joyes? And th'Divells too; if Envies Pupills stood Not peeping there these sparkling Rayes t'exclude? Thou Rod of Davids Root, Branch of his Bough My Lord, repare thy Palace, Deck thy Place. I'm but a Flesh and Blood bag: Oh! do thou Sill, Plate, Ridge, Rib, and Rafter me with Grace. Renew my Soule, and guild it all within: And hang thy saving Grace on ery Pin. My Soule, Lord, make thy Shining Temple, pave Its Floore all o're with Orient Grace: thus guild It o're with Heavens gold: Its Cabbins have Thy Treasuries with Choicest thoughts up filld. Pourtray thy Glorious Image round about Upon thy Temple Walls within, and Out. Garnish thy Hall with Gifts, Lord, from above With that Rich Coate of Male thy Righteousness, Truths Belt, the Spirits Sword, the Buckler Love Hopes Helmet, and the Shield of Faith kept fresh. The Scutchons of thy Honour make my Sign As Garland Tuns are badges made of Wine. New mould, new make me thus, me new Create Renew in me a spirit right, pure, true. Lord make me thy New Creature, then new make All things to thy New Creature here anew, New Heart, New thoughts, New Words, New wayes likewise. New Glory then shall to thyselfe arise. 31. Meditation. 1 Cor. 3.21.22. All things are yours. 17.12m [Feb.] 1688. Begracde with Glory, gloried with Grace, In Paradise I was, when all Sweet Shines Hung dangling on this Rosy World to face Mine Eyes, and Nose, and Charm mine Eares with Chimes. All these were golden Tills the which did hold My evidences wrapt in glorious folds. But as a Chrystall Glass, I broke, and lost That Grace, and Glory I was fashion'd in And cast this Rosy World with all its Cost Into the Dunghill Pit, and Puddle Sin. All right I lost in all Good things, each thing I had did hand a Vean of Venom in. Oh! Sad-Sad thing! Satan is now turnd Cook: Sin is the Sauce he gets for ev'ry Dish. I cannot bite a bit of Bread or Roote But what is sopt therein, and Venomish. Right's lost in what's my Right. Hence I do take Onely what's poison'd by th'infernall Snake. But this is not the Worst: there's worse than this. My Tast is lost; no bit tasts sweet to mee, But what is Dipt all over in this Dish Of Ranck ranck Poyson: this my Sauce must bee. Hell Heaven is, Heaven hell, yea Bitter Sweet: Poison's my Food: Food poison in't doth keep. What e're we want, we cannot Cry for, nay, If that we could, we could not have it thus. The Angell's can't devise, nor yet Convay Help in their Golden Pipes from God to us. But thou my Lord, (Heart leape for joy and sing) Hast done the Deed: and't makes the Heavens ring. By mee all lost, by thee all are regain'd. All things are thus fall'n now into thy hande. And thou steep'st in thy Blood what Sin had stain'd That th'Stains, and Poisons may not therein stand. And having stuck thy Grace all o're the same Thou giv'st it as a Glorious Gift again. Cleare up my Right, my Lord, in thee, and make Thy Name stand Dorst upon my Soule in print, In grace I mean, that so I may partake Of what I lost, in thee, and of thee in't. I'l take it then, Lord, at thy hand, and sing Out Hallelujah for thy Grace therein. 32. Meditation. 1 Cor. 3.22. Whether Paul or Apollos, or Cephas. 28.2m [Apr.] 1689. Thy Grace, Dear Lord's my golden Wrack, I finde Screwing my Phancy into ragged Rhimes, Tuning thy Praises in my feeble minde Untill I come to strike them on my Chimes. Were I an Angell bright, and borrow could King Davids Harp, I would them play on gold. But plung'd I am, my minde is puzzled, When I would spin my Phancy thus unspun, In finest Twine of Praise I'm muzzled. My tazzled Thoughts twirld into Snick-Snarls run. Thy Grace, my Lord, is such a glorious thing, It doth Confound me when I would it sing. Eternall Love an Object mean did smite Which by the Prince of Darkness was beguilde, That from this Love it ran and sweld with spite And in the way with filth was all defilde Yet must be reconcild, cleansd, and begrac'te Or from the fruits of Gods first Love displac'te. Then Grace, my Lord, wrought in thy Heart a vent, Thy Soft Soft hand to this hard worke did goe, And to the Milke White Throne of Justice went And entred bond that Grace might overflow. Hence did thy Person to my Nature ty And bleed through humane Veans to satisfy. Oh! Grace, Grace, Grace! this Wealthy Grace doth lay Her Golden Channells from thy Fathers throne, Into our Earthen Pitchers to Convay Heavens Aqua Vitae to us for our own. O! let thy Golden Gutters run into My Cup this Liquour till it overflow. Thine Ordinances, Graces Wine-fats where Thy Spirits Walkes, and Graces runs doe ly And Angells waiting stand with holy Cheere From Graces Conduite Head, with all Supply. These Vessells full of Grace are, and the Bowls In which their Taps do run, are pretious Souls. Thou to the Cups dost say (that Catch this Wine,) This Liquour, Golden Pipes, and Wine-fats plain, Whether Paul, Apollos, Cephas, all are thine. Oh Golden Word! Lord speake it ore again. Lord speake it home to me, say these are mine. My Bells shall then thy Praises bravely chime. 33. Meditation. 1 Cor. 3.22. Life is youres. 7.5m [July] 1689. My Lord my Life, can Envy ever bee A Golden Vertue? Then would God I were Top full thereof untill it colours mee With yellow streaks for thy Deare sake most Deare, Till I be Envious made by't at myselfe, As scarcely loving thee my Life, my Health. Oh! what strange Charm encrampt my Heart with spite Making my Love gleame out upon a Toy? Lay out Cart-Loads of Love upon a mite? Scarce lay a mite of Love on thee, my Joy? Oh, Lovely thou! Shalt not thou loved bee? Shall I ashame thee thus? Oh! shame for mee! Nature's amaz'de, Oh monstrous thing Quoth shee, Not Love my life? What Violence doth split True Love, and Life, that they should sunder'd bee? She doth not lay such Eggs, nor on them sit. How do I sever then my Heart with all Its Powers whose Love scarce to my Life doth crawle. Glory lin'de out a Paradise in Power Where e'ry seed a Royall Coach became For Life to ride in, to each shining Flower. And made mans Flower with glory all ore flame. Hells Inkfac'de Elfe black Venom spat upon The same, and kill'd it. So that Life is gone. Life thus abusde fled to the golden Arke, Lay lockt up there in Mercie's seate inclosde: Which did incorporate it whence its Sparke Enlivens all things in this Arke inclosde. Oh, glorious Arke! Life's Store-House full of Glee! Shall not my Love safe lockt up ly in thee? Lord arke my Soule safe in thyselfe, whereby I and my Life again may joyned bee. That I may finde what once I did destroy Again Conferde upon my soul in thee. Thou art this Golden Ark; this Living Tree Where life lies treasurde up for all in thee. Oh! Graft me in this Tree of Life within The Paradise of God, that I may live. Thy Life make live in mee; I'le then begin To bear thy Living Fruits, and them forth give. Give mee my Life this way; and I'le bestow My Love on thee my Life, and it shall grow. 34. Meditation. 1 Cor. 3.22. Death is Yours. 25.9m [Nov.] 1689. My Lord I fain would Praise thee Well but finde Impossibilities blocke up my pass. My tongue Wants Words to tell my thoughts, my Minde Wants thoughts to Comprehend thy Worth, alas! Thy Glory far Surmounts my thoughts, my thoughts Surmount my Words: Hence little Praise is brought. But seing Non-Sense very Pleasant is To Parents, flowing from the Lisping Child, I Conjue to thee, hoping thou in this Will finde some hearty Praise of mine Enfoild, But though my pen drop'd golden Words, yet would Thy Glory far out shine my Praise in Gold. Poor wretched man Deaths Captive stood full Chuffe But thou my Gracious Lord didst finde reliefe, Thou King of Glory didst, to handy cuff With King of Terrours, and dasht out his Teeth, Plucktst out his sting, his Poyson quelst, his head To pieces brakest. Hence Cruell Death lies Dead. And still thou by thy gracious Chymistry Dost of his Carkass Cordialls make rich, High, To free from Death makst Death a remedy: A Curb to Sin, a Spur to Piety. Heavens brightsom Light shines out in Death's Dark Cave. The Golden Dore of Glory is the Grave. The Painter lies who pensills death's Face grim With White bare butter Teeth, bare staring bones, With Empty Eyeholes, Ghostly Lookes which fling Such Dread to see as raiseth Deadly groans, For thou hast farely Washt Deaths grim grim face And made his Chilly finger-Ends drop grace. Death Tamde, Subdude, Washt fair by thee! Oh Grace! Made Usefull thus! thou unto thine dost say Now Death is yours, and all it doth in't brace. The Grave's a Down bed now made for your clay. Oh! Happiness! How should our Bells hereby Ring Changes, Lord, and praises trust with joy. Say I am thine, My Lord: Make me thy bell To ring thy Praise. Then Death is mine indeed A Hift to Grace, a Spur to Duty; Spell To Fear; a Frost to nip each naughty Weede. A Golden doore to Glory. Oh I'le sing This Triumph o're the Grave! Death where's thy Sting? 35. Meditation. 1 Cor. 3.22. Things Present. 19.11m [Jan.] 1689. Oh! that I ever felt what I profess. 'Twould make me then the happi'st man alive. Ten thousand Worlds of Saints can't make this less By living on't, but it would make them thrive. These Loaves and Fishes are not lessened Nor Pasture over stock, by being fed. Lord am I thine? art thou, Lord, mine? So rich! How doth thy Wealthy bliss branch out thy sweets Through all things Present? These the Vent-holes which Let out those Ravishing Joys our Souls to greet? Impower my Powers sweet Lord till up they raise My 'Fections that thy glory on them blaze. How many things are there now, who display'th? How many Acts each thing doth here dispense? How many Influences each thing hath? How many Contraries each Influence? How many Contraries from Things do flow? From Acts? from Influences? Who can show? How Glorious then is he that doth all raise Rule and Dispose and make them all Conspire In all their Jars, and Junctures, Good-bad wayes To meliorate the self same Object higher? Earth, Water, Fire, Winds, Herbs, Trees, Beasts and Men, Angells, and Divells, Bliss, Blasts, advance one stem? Hell, Earth, and Heaven with their Whole Troops come Contrary Windes, Grace, and Disgrace, Soure, Sweet, Wealth, Want, Health, Sickness, to Conclude in Sum All Providences Works in this good meet? Who, who can do't, but thou, my Lord? and thou Dost do this thing. Yea thou performst it now. Oh, that the Sweets of all these Windings, spoute Might, and these Influences streight, and Cross, Upon my Soule, to make thy Shine breake out That Grace might in get and get out my dross! My Soule up lockt then in this Clod of Dust Would lock up in't all Heavenly Joyes most just. But oh! thy Wisdom, Lord! thy Grace! thy Praise! Open mine Eyes to see the same aright. Take off their film, my Sins, and let the Rayes Of thy bright Glory on my peepholes light. I fain would love and better love thee should, If 'fore me thou thy Loveliness unfold. Lord, Cleare my Sight, thy Glory then out dart. And let thy Rayes beame Glory in mine eye And stick thy Loveliness upon my heart, Make me the Couch on which thy Love doth ly. Lord make my heart thy bed, thy heart make mine. Thy Love bed in my heart, bed mine in thine. 36. Meditation. 1 Cor. 3.22. Things to come yours. 16.1m [Mar.] 1689. What rocky heart is mine? My pincky Eyes Thy Grace spy blancht, Lord, in immensitie. But finde the Sight me not to meliorize, O Stupid Heart! What strang-strange thing am I? I many months do drown in Sorrows Spring But hardly raise a Sigh to blow down Sin. To find thee Lord, thus overflowing kinde, And t'finde mee thine, thus overflowing vile, A Riddle seems onrivetted I finde. This reason saith is hard to reconcile. Dost Vileness choose? Or can't thy kindness shown Me meliorate? Or am I not thine own? The first two run thy glory would to Shame: The last plea doth my Soule to hell Confine. My Faith therefore doth all these Pleas disdain. Thou kindness art, it saith, and I am thine. Upon this banck it doth on tiptoes stand To ken o're Reasons head at Graces hand. But Did I say, I wonder, Lord, to spie Thy Selfe so kind; and I so vile yet thine? I eate my Word: and wonder more that I No viler am, though all ore vile do shine. As full of Sin I am, as Egge of meate. Yet finde thy golden Rod my Sin to treate. Nay did I say, I wonder t'see thy Store Of kindnesses, yet me thus vile with all? I now Unsay my Say: I wonder more Thou dash me not to pieces with thy maule, But in the bed, Lord, of thy goodness lies The Reason of't, which makes my Wonders rise. For now I wonder t'feele how I thus feele. My Love leapes into Creatures bosoms; and Cold Sorrows fall into my Soule as Steel, When faile they, yet I kiss thy Love's White hand. I scarce know what t'make of myselfe. Wherefore I crave a Pardon, Lord, for thou hast Store. How wondrous rich art thou? Thy Storehouse vast Holdes more ten thousand fold told ore and ore Than this Wide World Can hold. The doore unshasp. And bring me thence a Pardon out therefore. Thou Stoughst the World so tite with present things That things to Come, though crowd full hard, cant in. These things to Come, tread on the heels of those. The presents breadth doth with the broad world run. The Depth and breadth of things to come out goes Unto Times End which bloweth out the Sun. These breadth and length meate out Eternity. These are the things that in thy Storehouse ly. A Cockle Shell contains this World as well As can this World thy Liberallness contain. And by thy Will these present things all fell Unto thy Children for their present gain; And things to Come too, to Eternity. Thou Willedst them: they're theirs by Legacy. But am I thine? Oh! what strange thing's in mee? Enricht thus by thy Legacy? yet finde When one small Twig's broke off, the breach should bee Such an Enfeebling thing upon my minde. Then take a pardon from thy Store, and twist It in my Soule for help. 'Twill not be mist. I am asham'd to say I love thee do. But dare not for my Life, and Soule deny't. Yet wonder much Love's Springs should lie so low Thy loveliness its Object shines so bright. Shall all the Beams of Love upon me shine? And shall my Love Love's Object still make pine? I'me surely made a Gazing Stock to all. The Holy Angells Wonder: and the Mock Of Divells (pining that they misse it all) To see these beams gild me a Stupid Stock. Thy Argument is good, Lord point it, come Let't lance my heart, till True Loves Veane doth run. But that there is a Crevice for one hope To creep in, and this Message to Convay That I am thine, makes me refresh. Lord ope The Doore so wide that Love may Scip, and play. My Spirits then shall dance thy Praise. I'me thine. And Present things with things to come are mine. 37. Meditation. 1 Cor. 3.23. You are Christ's. 4.3m [May] 1690. My Soule, Lord, quailes to thinke that I should bee So high related, have such colours faire Stick in my Hat, from Heaven: yet should see My Soule thus blotcht: Hells Liveries to beare. What Thine? New-naturizd? Yet this Relation Thus barren, though't 's a Priviledg-Foundation? Shall I thy Vine branch be, yet grapes none beare? Grafft in thy Olive stand: and fatness lack? A Shackeroon, a Ragnell, yet an Heire? Thy spouse, yet, oh! my Wedden Ring thus slack? Should Angel-Feathers plume my Cap, I should Be swash? but oh! my Heart hereat grows Cold. What is my Title but an empty Claim? Am I a fading Flower within thy Knot? A Rattle, or a gilded Box, a Flame Of Painted Fire, a glorious Weedy Spot? The Channell ope of Union, the ground Of Wealth, Relation: yet I'me barren found? What am I thine, and thou not mine? or dost Not thou thy Spouse joyn in thy Glory Cleare? Is my Relation to thee but a boast? Or but a blustring say-so, or spruice jeere? Should Roses blow more late, sure I might get, If thine, some Prim-Rose or sweet Violet? Make me thy Branch to bare thy Grapes, Lord, feed Mee with thy bunch of Raisins of the Sun. Mee stay with apples; let me eate indeed Fruits of the tree of Life: its richly hung. Am I thy Child, Son, Heir, thy Spouse, yet gain Not of the Rights that these Relations claim? Am I hop't on thy knees, yet not at ease? Sunke in thy bosom, yet thy Heart not meet? Lodgd in thine Arms? yet all things little please? Sung sweetly, yet finde not this singing sweet? Set at thy Table, yet scarce tast a Dish Delicious? Hugd, yet seldom gain a Kiss? Why? Lord, why thus? Shall I in Question Call All my Relation to thyselfe? I know It is no Gay to please a Child withall But is the Ground whence Priviledges flow. Then ope the sluce: let some thing spoute on me. Then I shall in a better temper bee. 38. Meditation. 1 Joh. 2.1. An Advocate With the Father. 6.5m [July] 1690. Oh! What a thing is Man? Lord, Who am I? That thou shouldst give him Law (Oh! golden Line) To regulate his Thoughts, Words, Life thereby. And judge him Wilt thereby too in thy time. A Court of Justice thou in heaven holdst To try his Case while he's here housd on mould. How do thy Angells lay before thine eye My Deeds both White, and Black I dayly doe? How doth thy Court thou Pannellst there them try? But flesh complains. What right for this? let's know. For right, or wrong I can't appeare unto't. And shall a sentence Pass on such a suite? Soft; blemish not this golden Bench, or place. Here is no Bribe, nor Colourings to hide Nor Pettifogger to befog the Case But Justice hath her Glory here well tri'de. Her spotless Law all spotted Cases tends. Without Respect or Disrespect them ends. God's Judge himselfe: and Christ Atturny is, The Holy Ghost Regesterer is founde. Angells the sergeants are, all Creatures kiss The booke, and doe as Evidences abounde. All Cases pass according to pure Law And in the sentence is no Fret, nor flaw. What saist, my soule? Here all thy Deeds are tri'de. Is Christ thy Advocate to pleade thy Cause? Art thou his Client? Such shall never slide. He never lost his Case: he pleads such Laws As Carry do the same, nor doth refuse The Vilest sinners Case that doth him Choose. This is his Honour, not Dishonour: nay No Habeas-Corpus gainst his Clients came For all their Fines his Purse doth make down pay. He Non-Suites Satan's Suite or Casts the Same. He'l plead thy Case, and not accept a Fee. He'l plead Sub Forma Pauperis for thee. My Case is bad. Lord, be my Advocate. My sin is red: I'me under Gods Arrest. Thou hast the Hint of Pleading; plead my State. Although it's bad thy Plea will make it best. If thou wilt plead my Case before the King: I'le Waggon Loads of Love, and Glory bring. 39. Meditation. from 1 Joh. 2.1. If any man sin, we have an Advocate. 9.9m [Nov.] 1690. My Sin! my Sin, My God, these Cursed Dregs, Green, Yellow, Blew streakt Poyson hellish, ranck, Bubs hatcht in natures nest on Serpents Eggs, Yelp, Cherp and Cry; they set my Soule a Cramp. I frown, Chide, strik and fight them, mourn and Cry To Conquour them, but cannot them destroy. I cannot kill nor Coop them up: my Curb 'S less than a Snaffle in their mouth: my Rains They as a twine thrid, snap: by hell they're spurd: And load my Soule with swagging loads of pains. Black Imps, young Divells, snap, bite, drag to bring And pick mee headlong hells dread Whirle Poole in. Lord, hold thy hand: for handle mee thou may'st In Wrath: but, oh, a twinckling Ray of hope Methinks I spie thou graciously display'st. There is an Advocate: a doore is ope. Sin's poyson swell my heart would till it burst, Did not a hope hence creep in't thus, and nurse't. Joy, joy, Gods Son's the Sinners Advocate Doth plead the Sinner guiltless, and a Saint. But yet Atturnies pleas spring from the State The Case is in: if bad its bad in plaint. My Papers do contain no pleas that do Secure mee from, but knock me down to, woe. I have no plea mine Advocate to give: What now? He'l anvill Arguments greate Store Out of his Flesh and Blood to make thee live. O Deare bought Arguments: Good pleas therefore. Nails made of heavenly Steel, more Choice than gold Drove home, Well Clencht, eternally will hold. Oh! Dear bought Plea, Deare Lord, what buy't so deare? What with thy blood purchase thy plea for me? Take Argument out of thy Grave t'appeare And plead my Case with, me from Guilt to free. These maule both Sins, and Divells, and amaze Both Saints, and Angells; Wreath their mouths with praise. What shall I doe, my Lord? what do, that I May have thee plead my Case? I fee thee will With Faith, Repentance, and obediently Thy Service gainst Satanick Sins fulfill. I'l fight thy fields while Live I do, although I should be hackt in pieces by thy foe. Make me thy Friend, Lord, be my Surety: I Will be thy Client, be my Advocate: My Sins make thine, thy Pleas make mine hereby. Thou wilt mee save, I will thee Celebrate. Thou'lt kill my Sins that cut my heart within: And my rough Feet shall thy smooth praises sing. 40. Meditation. 1 Joh. 2.2. He is a Propitiation for our Sin. 12m [Feb.] 1690/1. Still I complain; I am complaining still. Oh! woe is me! Was ever Heart like mine? A Sty of Filth, a Trough of Washing-Swill A Dunghill Pit, a Puddle of mere Slime. A Nest of Vipers, Hive of Hornets; Stings. A Bag of Poyson, Civit-Box of Sins. Was ever Heart like mine? So bad? black? Vile? Is any Divell blacker? Or can Hell Produce its match? It is the very Soile Where Satan reads his Charms, and sets his Spell. His Bowling Ally, where he sheeres his fleece At Nine Pins, Nine Holes, Morrice, Fox and Geese. His Palace Garden where his courtiers walke. His Jewells Cabbinet. Here his Caball Do sham it, and truss up their Privie talk In Fardells of Consults and bundles all. His shambles, and his Butchers stale's herein. It is the Fuddling Schoole of every sin. Was ever Heart like mine? Pride, Passion, fell. Ath'ism, Blasphemy, pot, pipe it, dance Play Barlybreaks, and at last Couple in Hell. At Cudgells, Kit-Cat, Cards and Dice here prance. At Noddy, Ruff-and-trumpt, Jing, Post-and-Pare, Put, One-and-thirty, and such other ware. Grace shuffled is away: Patience oft sticks Too soon, or draws itselfe out, and's out Put. Faith's over trumpt, and oft doth lose her tricks. Repentance's Chalkt up Noddy, and out shut. They Post, and Pare off Grace thus, and its shine. Alas! alas! was ever Heart like mine? Sometimes methinks the serpents head I mall: Now all is still: my spirits do recreute. But ere my Harpe can tune sweet praise, they fall On me afresh, and tare me at my Root. They bite like Badgers now nay worse, although I tooke them toothless sculls, rot long agoe. My Reason now's more than my sense, I feele I have more Sight than Sense. Which seems to bee A Rod of Sun beams t'whip mee for my steele. My Spirits spiritless, and dull in mee For my dead prayerless Prayers: the Spirits winde Scarce blows my mill about. I little grinde. Was ever Heart like mine? My Lord, declare. I know not what to do: What shall I doe? I wonder, split I don't upon Despare. Its grace's wonder that I wrack not so. I faintly shun't: although I see this Case Would say, my sin is greater than thy grace. Hope's Day-peep dawns hence through this chinck. Christs name Propitiation is for sins. Lord, take It so for mine. Thus quench thy burning flame In that clear stream that from his side forth brake. I can no Comfort take while thus I see Hells cursed Imps thus jetting strut in mee. Lord take thy sword: these Anakims destroy: Then soake my soule in Zions Bucking tub With Holy Soap, and Nitre, and rich Lye. From all Defilement me cleanse, wash and rub. Then wrince, and wring mee out till th'water fall As pure as in the Well: not foule at all. And let thy Sun, shine on my Head out cleare. And bathe my Heart within its radient beams: Thy Christ make my Propitiation Deare. Thy Praise shall from my Heart breake forth in streams. This reeching Vertue of Christs blood will quench Thy Wrath, slay Sin and in thy Love mee bench. 41. Meditation. Joh. 14.2. I go to prepare a Place for you. 24.3m [May] 1691. A Clew of Wonders! Clusterd Miracles! Angells, come whet your sight hereon. Here's ground. Sharpen your Phansies here, ye Saints in Spiricles. Here is enough in Wonderment to drownd's. Make here the Shining dark or White on which Let all your Wondring Contemplations pitch. The Magnet of all Admiration's here. Your tumbling thoughts turn here. Here is Gods Son, Wove in a Web of Flesh, and Bloode rich geere. Eternall Wisdoms Huswifry well spun. Which through the Laws pure Fulling mills did pass. And so went home the Wealthy'st Web that was. And why thus shew? Hark, harke, my Soule. He came To pay thy Debt. And being come most Just The Creditor did sue him for the same, Did winn the Case, and in the grave him thrust. Who having in this Prison paid the Debt. And took a Quittance, made Death's Velvet fret. He broke her Cramping tallons did unlute The sealed Grave, and gloriously up rose. Ascendeth up to glory on this Sute, Prepares a place for thee where glorie glowes. Yea yea for thee, although thy griefe out gush At such black Sins at which the Sun may blush. What Wonder's here? Big belli'd Wonders in't Remain, though wrought for Saints as white as milk. But done for me whose blot's as black as inke. A Clew of Wonders finer far than Silke. Thy hand alone that wound this Clew I finde Can to display these Wonders it unwinde. Why didst thou thus? Reason stands gasterd here. She's overflown: this Soares above her Sight. Gods onely Son for Sinners thus appeare, Prepare for Durt a throne in glory bright! Stand in the Doore of Glory to imbrace Such dirty bits of Dirt, with such a grace! Reason, lie prison'd in this golden Chain. Chain up thy tongue, and silent stand a while. Let this rich Love thy Love and heart obtain To tend thy Lord in all admiring Style. Lord screw my faculties up to the Skill And height of praise as answers thy good Will. Then while I eye the Place thou hast prepar'de For such as I, I'le sing thy glory out Untill thou welcome me, as 'tis declar'de In this sweet glory runing rounde about. I would do more but can't, Lord help me so That I may pay in glory what I owe. 42. Meditation. Rev. 3.22. I will give Him to sit with me in my Throne. 2.6m [Aug.] 1691. Apples of gold, in silver pictures shrin'de Enchant the appetite, make mouths to water. And Loveliness in Lumps, tunn'd, and enrin'de In Jasper Cask, when tapt, doth briskly vaper: Brings forth a birth of Keyes t'unlock Loves Chest, That Love, like Birds, may fly to't from its nest. Such is my Lord, and more. But what strang thing Am I become? Sin rusts my Lock all o're. Though he ten thousand Keyes all on a string Takes out, scarce one, is found, unlocks the Doore. Which ope, my Love crincht in a Corner lies Like some shrunck Crickling: and scarce can rise. Lord ope the Doore: rub off my Rust, Remove My sin, And Oyle my Lock. (Dust there doth shelfe). My Wards will trig before thy Key: my Love Then, as enliven'd, leape will on thyselve. It needs must be, that giving handes receive Again Receivers Hearts furld in Love Wreath. Unkey my Heart; unlock thy Wardrobe: bring Out royall Robes: adorne my Soule, Lord: so, My Love in rich attire shall on my King Attend, and honour on him well bestow. In Glory he prepares for his a place Whom he doth all beglory here with grace. He takes them to the shining threashould cleare Of his bright Palace, cloath'd in Grace's flame. Then takes them in thereto, not onely there To have a Prospect, but possess the same. The Crown of Life, the Throne of Glorys Place, The Fathers House blancht o're with orient Grace. Can'an in golden print enwalld with jems: A Kingdome rim'd with Glory round: in fine A glorious Crown pal'de thick with all the stems Of Grace, and of all Properties Divine. How happy wilt thou make mee when these shall As a bless't Heritage unto mee fall? Adorn me, Lord, with Holy Huswifry. All blanch my Robes with Clusters of thy Graces: Thus lead me to thy threashold: give mine Eye A Peephole there to see bright glories Chases. Then take mee in: I'le pay, when I possess, Thy Throne, to thee the Rent in Happiness. 43. Meditation. Rev. 2.10. A Crown of Life. 8.9m [Nov.] 1691. Fain I would sing thy Praise, but feare I feign. My Sin doth keepe out of my heart thy Feare, Damps Love: defiles my Soule. Old Blots new stain. Hopes hoppled lie, and rusty Chains worn cleare. My Sins that make me stand in need of thee, Do keep me back to hugge all Sin I see. Nature's Corrupt, a nest of Passion, Pride, Lust, Worldliness, and such like bubs: I pray, But struggling finde, these bow my Heart aside. A Knot of Imps at barly breaks in't play. They do inchant me from my Lord, I finde, The thoughts whereof proove Daggers in my minde. Pardon, and Poyson them, Lord, with thy Blood. Cast their Curst Karkasses out of my Heart. My Heart fill with thy Love: let Grace it dub. Make this my Silver Studs by thy rich art. My Soule shall then be thy sweet Paradise. Thou'st be its Rose, and it thy Bed of Spice. Why mayn't my Faith now drinke thy Health, Lord, ore, The Head of all my Sins? And Cast her Eye, In glorifying glances, on the Doore Of thy Free Grace, where Crowns of Life do lie? Thou'lt give a Crown of Life to such as bee Faithfull to Death. And shall Faith faile in mee? A Crown of Life, of Glory, Righteousness, Thou wilt adorn them with, that will not fade. Shall Faith in mee shrinke up for Feebleness? Nor take my Sins by th'Crown, till Crownless made? Breath, Lord, thy Spirit on my Faith, that I May have thy Crown of Life, and Sin may dy. How Spirituall? Holy shall I shine, when I Thy Crown of Righteousness ware on my Head? How Glorious when thou dost me glorify To ware thy Crown of Glory pollished? How shall I when thy Crown of Life I ware In lively Colours flowrish, fresh, and fair? When thou shalt Crown me with these Crowns I'l bend My Shallow Crown to crown with Songs thy Name. Angels shall set the tune, I'le it attend: Thy Glory'st be the burden of the same. Till then I cannot sing, my tongue is tide. Accept this Lisp till I am glorifide. 44. Meditation. 2 Tim. 4.8. A Crown of Righteousness. 17.11m [Jan.] 1691. A Crown, Lord, yea, a Crown of Righteousness. Oh! what a Gift is this? Give Lord I pray An Holy Head, and Heart it to possess And I shall give thee glory for the pay. A Crown is brave, and Righteousness much more. The glory of them both will pay the score. A Crown indeed consisting of fine gold Adherent, and Inherent Righteousness, Stuck with their Ripe Ripe Fruits in every fold Like studded Carbuncles they do it dress. A Righteous Life doth ever ware renown And thrusts the Head at last up in this Crown. A Milk whit hand sets't on a Righteous Head. An hand Unrighteous can't dispose it nay It's not in such an hande. Such hands would bed Black Smuts on't should they fingers on it lay. Who can the Crown of Righteousness suppose In an Unrighteous hand for to dispose. When once upon the head its ever green And altogether Usde in Righteousness, Where blessed bliss, and blissfull Peace is seen, And where no jar, nor brawler hath access. Oh! blessed Crown what hold the breadth of all The State of Happiness in Heavens Hall. A Crown of Righteousness, a Righteous Head, Oh naughty man! my brain pan turrit is Where Swallows build, and hatch: Sins black and red. My head and heart do ach, and frob at this. Lord were my Turret cleansd, and made by thee Thy Graces Dovehouse turret much might bee. Oh! make it so: then Righteousness pure, true Shall Roost upon my boughs, and in my heart And all its fruits that in Obedience grew To stud this Crown like jems in every part. Ist then be garnisht for this Crown, and thou Shalt have my Songs to diadem thy brow. Oh! Happy me, if thou wilt Crown me thus. Oh! naughty heart! What swell with Sin? fy, fy. Oh! Gracious Lord, me pardon: do not Crush Me all to mammocks: Crown and not destroy. Ile tune thy Prayses while this Crown doth come. Thy Glory bring I tuckt up in my Songe. 45. Meditation. 1 Pet. 5.4. Ye shall receive a Crown of Glory. 24.2m [Apr.] 1692. A Crown of Glory! Oh! I'm base, its true. My Heart's a Swamp, Brake, Thicket vile of Sin. My Head's a Bog of Filth; Blood bain'd doth spew Its venom streaks of Poyson o're my Skin. My Members Dung-Carts that bedung at pleasure, My Life, the Pasture where Hells Hurdloms leasure. Becrown'd with Filth! Oh! what vile thing am I? What Cost, and Charge to make mee Meddow ground? To drain my Bogs? to lay my Frog-pits dry? To stub up all my brush that doth abound? That I may be thy Pasture fat and frim, Where thy choice Flowers, and Hearbs of Grace shine trim? Vast charge thus to subdue me: Wonders play Hereat like Gamesters; 'bellisht Thoughts dresst fine, In brave attire, cannot a finger lay Upon it that doth not besmut the Shine. Yet all this cost and more thou'rt at with me. And still I'm sad, a Seing Eye may see. Yet more than this: my Hands that Crown'd thy Head With sharpest thorns, thou washest in thy Grace. My Feet that did upon thy Choice Blood tread Thou makest beautifull thy Way to trace. My Head that knockt against thy head, thou hugg'st Within thy bosom: boxest not, nor lugg'st. Nay more as yet: thou borrow'st of each Grace That stud the Hearts of Saints, and Angells bright Its brightest beams, the beams too of the place Where Glory dwells: and all the Beames of Light Thy, and thy Fathers Glorious Face out spread, To make this Crown of Glory for my head. If it was possible the thoughts that are Imbellisht with the riches of this tender Could torment such as do this bright Crown Ware, Their Love to thee Lord's lac'de so streight, and slender. These beams would draw up Griefe to cloude this Glory, But not so then; though now Grace acts this Story. My Pen enravisht with these Rayes out strains A sorry Verse: and when my gold dwells in A Purse guilt with the glory bright that flames Out from this Crown, I'le tune an higher pin. Then make me Lord heir of this Crown. Ile sing And make thy Praise on my Heroicks ring. 46. Meditation. Rev. 3.5. The same shall be cloathed in White Raiment. 17.5m [July] 1692. Nay, may I, Lord, believe it? Shall my Skeg Be ray'd in thy White Robes? My thatcht old Cribb (Immortal Purss hung on a mortall Peg,) Wilt thou with fair'st array in heaven rig? I'm but a jumble of gross Elements A Snaile Horn where an Evill Spirit tents. A Dirt ball dresst in milk white Lawn, and deckt In Tissue tagd with gold, or Ermins flush, That mocks the Starrs, and sets them in a fret To se themselves out shone thus. Oh they blush. Wonders stand gastard here. But yet my Lord, This is but faint to what thou dost afford. I'm but a Ball of dirt. Wilt thou adorn Mee with thy Web wove in thy Loom Divine The Whitest Web in Glory, that the morn Nay, that all Angell glory, doth ore shine? They ware no such. This whitest Lawn most fine Is onely worn, my Lord, by thee and thine. This Saye's no flurr of Wit, nor new Coin'd Shape Of frollick Fancie in a Rampant Brain. It's juyce Divine bled from the Choicest Grape That ever Zions Vinyarde did mentain. Such Mortall bits immortalliz'de shall ware More glorious robes, than glorious Angells bare. Their Web is wealthy, wove of Wealthy Silke Well wrought indeed, its all brancht Taffity. But this thy Web more white by far than milke Spun on thy Wheele twine of thy Deity Wove in thy Web, Fulld in thy mill by hand Makes them in all their bravery seem tand. This Web is wrought by best, and noblest Art That heaven doth afford of twine most choice All brancht, and richly flowerd in every part With all the sparkling flowers of Paradise To be thy Ware alone, who hast no peere And Robes for glorious Saints to thee most deare. Wilt thou, my Lord, dress my poore wither'd Stump In this rich web whose whiteness doth excell The Snow, though 'tis most black? And shall my Lump Of Clay ware more than e're on Angells fell? What shall my bit of Dirt be deckt so fine That shall Angelick glory all out shine? Shall things run thus? Then Lord, my tumberill Unload of all its Dung, and make it cleane. And load it with thy wealthi'st Grace untill Its Wheeles do crack, or Axletree complain. I fain would have it cart thy harvest in, Before its loosed from its Axlepin. Then screw my Strings up to thy tune that I May load thy Glory with my Songs of praise. Make me thy Shalm, thy praise my Songs, whereby My mean Shoshannim may thy Michtams raise. And when my Clay ball's in thy White robes dresst My tune perfume thy praise shall with the best. 47. Meditation on Matt. 25.21. Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord. 9.8m [Oct.] 1692. Strang, strang indeed. It rowell doth my heart With pegs of Greefe, and tents of greatest joy: When I wore Angells Glory in each part And all my skirts wore flashes of rich die Of Heavenly Colour, hedg'd in with rosie Reechs, A spider spit its Vomit on my Cheeks. This ranckling juyce bindg'd in its cursed stain Doth permeat both Soul and Body: soile And drench each Fibre, and infect each grain. Its ugliness swells over all the ile. Whose stain'd mishapen bulk's too high, and broad For th'Entry of the narrow gate to God. Ready to burst, thus, and to burn in hell: Now in my path I finde a Waybred spring Whose leafe drops balm that doth this venom quell And juyce's a Bath, that doth all stains out bring And sparkling beauty in the room convay. Lord feed me with this Waybred Leafe, I pray. My stain will out: and swelling swage apace. And holy Lusters on my shape appeare. All Rosie Buds: and Lilly flowers of grace Will grace my turfe with sweet sweet glory here. Under whose shades Angells will bathing play Who'l guard my Pearle to glory, hous'd in clay. Those Gates of Pearle, porter'd with Seraphims, On their carbuncle joynts will open wide. And entrance give me where all glory swims In to the Masters Joy, e're to abide. O sweet sweet thought. Lord take this praise though thin. And when I'm in't Ile tune an higher pin. 48. Meditation on Matt. 25.21. Enter into the Joy of thy Lord. 10m? [Dec.] 1692. When I, Lord, eye thy Joy, and my Love, small, My heart gives in: what now? Strange! Sure I love thee! And finding brambles 'bout my heart to crawl My heart misgives mee. Prize I ought above thee? Such great Love hugging them, such small Love, thee! Whether thou hast my Love, I scarce can see. My reason rises up, and chides my Cup Bright Loveliness itselfe. What not love thee! Tumbling thy Joy, Lord, ore, it rounds me up. Shall loves nest be a thorn bush: not thee bee? Set Hovells up of thorn kids in my heart! Avant adultrous Love. From me depart. The Influences my vile heart sucks in Of Puddle Water boyld by Sunn beams till Its Spiritless, and dead, nothing more thin Tasts wealthier than those thou dost distill. This seems to numb my heart to think that I Should null all good to optimate a toy. Yet when the beamings, Lord, of thy rich Joys, Do guild my Soule, meethinks I'm sure I Love thee. They Calcine all these brambly trumperys And now I'm sure that I prize naught above thee. Thy beams making a bonefire of my Stack Of Faggots, bring my Love to thee in'ts pack. For when the Objects of thy Joy impress Their shining influences on my heart My Soule seems an Alembick doth possess Love stilld into rich Spirits by thy Art. And all my pipes, were they ten thousand would Drop Spirits of Love on thee, more rich than gold. Now when the world with all her dimples in't Smiles on me, I do love thee more than all: And when her glory freshens, all in print, I prize thee still above it all. And shall. Nay all her best to thee, do what she can, Drops but like drops dropt in a Closestoole pan. The Castings of thy Joy, my Lord therefore Let in the Cabbin of my Joy rise high, And let thy Joy enter in mee before I enter do into my masters joy. Thy joyes in mee will make my Pipes to play For joy thy Praise while teather'd to my clay. 49. Meditation. Matt. 25.21. The joy of thy Lord. 26.12m [Feb.] 1692. Lord, do away my Motes: and Mountains great. My nut is vitiate. Its kirnell rots: Come, kill the Worm, that doth its kirnell eate And strike thy sparkes within my tinderbox. Drill through my metall-heart an hole wherein With graces Cotters to thyselfe it pin. A Lock of Steel upon my Soule, whose key The serpent keeps, I fear, doth lock my doore. O pick't: and through the key-hole make thy way And enter in: and let thy joyes run o're. My Wards are rusty. Oyle them till they trig Before thy golden key: thy Oyle makes glib. Take out the Splinters of the World that stick Do in my heart: Friends, Honours, Riches, and The Shivers in't of Hell whose venoms quick And firy make it swoln and ranckling stand. These wound and kill: those shackle strongly to Poore knobs of Clay, my heart. Hence sorrows grow. Cleanse, and enlarge my kask: It is too small: And tartarizd with worldly dregs dri'de in't. It's bad mouth'd too: and though thy joyes do Call That boundless are, it ever doth them stint. Make me thy Chrystall Caske: those wines in't tun That in the Rivers of thy joyes do run. Lord make me, though suckt through a straw or Quill, Tast of the Rivers of thy joyes, some drop. 'Twill sweeten me: and all my Love distill Into thy glass, and me for joy make hop. 'Twill turn my water into wine: and fill My Harp with Songs my Masters joyes distill. Preparatory Meditations SECOND SERIES 1. Meditation. Col. 2.17. Which are Shaddows of things to come and the body is Christs. [16]93. Oh Leaden heeld. Lord, give, forgive I pray. Infire my Heart: it bedded is in Snow. I Chide myselfe seing myselfe decay. In heate and Zeale to thee, I frozen grow. File my dull Spirits: make them sharp and bright: Them firbush for thyselfe, and thy delight. My Stains are such, and sinke so deep, that all The Excellency in Created Shells Too low, and little is to make it fall Out of my leather Coate wherein it dwells. This Excellence is but a Shade to that Which is enough to make my Stains go back. The glory of the world slickt up in types In all Choise things chosen to typify, His glory upon whom the worke doth light, To thine's a Shaddow, or a butterfly. How glorious then, my Lord, art thou to mee Seing to cleanse me, 's worke alone for thee. The glory of all Types doth meet in thee. Thy glory doth their glory quite excell: More than the Sun excells in its bright glee A nat, an Earewig, Weevill, Snaile, or Shell. Wonders in Crowds start up; your eyes may strut Viewing his Excellence, and's bleeding cut. Oh! that I had but halfe an eye to view This excellence of thine, undazled: so Therewith to give my heart a touch anew Untill I quickned am, and made to glow. All is too little for thee: but alass Most of my little all hath other pass. Then Pardon, Lord, my fault: and let thy beams Of Holiness pierce through this Heart of mine. Ope to thy Blood a passage through my veans. Let thy pure blood my impure blood refine. Then with new blood and spirits I will dub My tunes upon thy Excellency good. 2. Meditation. Coll. 1.15. The First Born of Every Creature. Oh! Golden Rose! Oh. Glittering Lilly White Spic'd o're With heavens File divine, till Rayes Fly forth whose Shine doth Wrack the strongest Sight That Wonders Eye is tent of, while't doth gaze On thee. Whose Swaddle Bonde's Eternity. And Sparkling Cradle is Rich Deity. First Born of e'ry Being: hence a Son Begot o'th'First: Gods onely Son begot. Hence Deity all ore. Gods nature run Into a Filiall Mould: Eternall knot. A Father then, and Son: persons distinct. Though them Sabellians contrar'ly inckt. This mall of Steell falls hard upon those foes Of truth, who make the Holy Trinity Into One Person: Arrians too and those Socinians calld, who do Christs Deity Bark out against. But Will they, nill they, they Shall finde this Mall to split their brains away. Come shine, Deare Lord, out in my heart indeed First Born; in truth before thee there was none First Born, as man, born of a Virgin's seed: Before or after thee such up ne'er sprung. Hence Heir of all things lockt in natures Chest: And in thy Fathers too: extreamly best. Thou Object of Gods boundless brightest Love, Invested with all sparkling rayes of Light Distill thou down, what hony falls above Bedew the Angells Copses, fill our Sight And hearts therewith within thy Father's joy. These are but Shreads under thy bench that ly. Oh! that my Soul was all enamored With this First Born enough: a Lump of Love Son of Eternall Father, Chambered Once in a Virgins Womb, dropt from above. All Humane royalty hereby Divin'de. The First Born's Antitype: in whom they're shrin'de. Make mee thy Babe, and him my Elder Brother. A Right, Lord grant me in his Birth Right high. His Grace, my Treasure make above all other: His Life my Sampler: My Life his joy. I'le hang my love then on his heart, and sing New Psalms on Davids Harpe to thee and him. 3. Meditation. Rom. 5.14. Who is the Figure of Him that was to come. 15.8m [Oct.] 1693. Like to the Marigold, I blushing close My golden blossoms when thy sun goes down: Moist'ning my leaves with Dewy Sighs, half frose By the nocturnall Cold, that hoares my Crown. Mine Apples ashes are in apple shells And dirty too: strange and bewitching spells! When Lord, mine Eye doth spie thy Grace to beame Thy Mediatoriall glory in the shine Out Spouted so from Adams typick streame And Emblemiz'd in Noahs pollisht shrine Thine theirs outshines so far it makes their glory In brightest Colours, seem a smoaky story. But when mine Eye full of these beams, doth cast Its rayes upon my dusty essence thin Impregnate with a Sparke Divine, defacde, All Candid o're with Leprosie of Sin, Such Influences on my Spirits light, Which them as bitter gall, or Cold ice smite. My brissled sins hence do so horrid peare, None but thyselfe, (and thou deckt up must bee In thy Transcendent glory sparkling cleare) A Mediator unto God for mee. So high they rise, Faith scarce can toss a Sight Over their head upon thyselfe to light. Is't possible such glory, Lord, ere should Center its Love on me Sins Dunghill else? My Case up take? make it its own? Who would Wash with his blood my blots out? Crown his shelfe Or Dress his golden Cupboard with such ware? This makes my pale facde Hope almost despare. Yet let my Titimouses Quill suck in Thy Graces milk Pails some small drop: or Cart A Bit, or Splinter of some Ray, the wing Of Grace's sun sprindgd out, into my heart: To build there Wonders Chappell where thy Praise Shall be the Psalms sung forth in gracious layes. 4. Meditation. Gal. 4.24. Which things are an Allegorie. 24.10m [Dec.] 1693. My Gracious Lord, I would thee glory doe: But finde my Garden over grown with weeds: My Soile is sandy; brambles o're it grow; My Stock is stunted; branch no good Fruits breeds. My Garden weed: Fatten my Soile, and prune My Stock, and make it with thy glory bloome. O Glorious One, the gloriou'st thought I thincke Of thee falls black as Inck upon thy Glory. The brightest Saints that rose, do Star like, pinck. Nay, Abrams Shine to thee's an Allegory, Or fleeting Sparke in th'Smoke, to typify Thee, and thy Glorious Selfe in mystery. Should all the Sparks in heaven, the Stars there dance A Galliard, Round about the Sun, and stay His Servants (while on Easter morn his prance Is o're, which old wives prate of) O brave Play. Thy glorious Saints thus boss thee round, which stand Holding thy glorious Types out in their hand. But can I thinck this Glory greate, its head Thrust in a pitchy cloude, should strangled ly Or tucking up its beams should go to bed Within the Grave, darke me to glorify? This Mighty thought my hearts too streight for, though I hold it by the hand, and let not goe. Then, my Blesst Lord, let not the Bondmaids type Take place in mee. But thy blesst Promisd Seed. Distill thy Spirit through thy royall Pipe Into my Soule, and so my Spirits feed, Then them, and me still into praises right Into thy Cup where I to swim delight. Though I desire so much, I can't o're doe. All that my Can contains, to nothing comes When summed up, it onely Cyphers grows Unless thou set thy Figures to my Sums. Lord set thy Figure 'fore them, greate, or small. To make them something, and I'l give thee all. 5. Meditation on Gal. 3.16. And to thy Seed Which is Christ. 4.1m [Mar.] 1693/4. Art thou, Lord, Abraham's Seed, and Isaac too? His Promisd Seed? That One and Only Seed? How can this bee? Paul certainly saith true. But one Seed promisd. Sir this Riddle read. Christ is the Metall: Isaack is the Oar. Christ is the Pearle, in Abraham's tread therefore. Christ's Antitype Isaac his Type up spires In many things, but Chiefly this because This Isaac, and the Ram caught in the briars One Sacrifice, fore shew by typick laws Christs Person, all Divine, joynd whereto's made Unperson'd Manhood, on the Altar's laid. The full grown Ram, provided none knows how, Typing Christ's Manhood, made by God alone Caught in the brambles by the horns, must bow, Under the Knife: The manhoods Death, and Groan. Yet Isaac's leaping from the Altar's bed, Foretold its glorious rising from the Dead. But why did things run thus? For Sin indeed, No lesser price than this could satisfy. Oh costly Sin! this makes mine intraills bleed. What fills my Shell, did make my Saviour die. What Grace then's this of God, and Christ that stills Out of this Offering into our tills? Lord with thine Altars Fire, mine Inward man Refine from dross: burn out my sinfull guise And make my Soul thine Altars Drippen pan To Catch the Drippen of thy Sacrifice. This is the Unction thine receive; the which Doth teach them all things of an happy pitch. Thy Altars Fire burns not to ashes down This Offering. But it doth roast it here. This is thy Roastmeate cooked up sweet, brown, Upon thy table set for Souls good cheer. The Drippen, and the meate are royall fair That fatten Souls, that with it welcomd are. My Trencher, Lord, with thy Roast Mutton dress: And my dry Bisket in thy Dripping Sap. And feed my Soul with thy Choice Angell Mess: My heart thy Praise, Will, tweedling Larklike tap. My florid notes, like Tenderills of Vines Twine round thy Praise, plants sprung in true Love's Mines. 6. Meditation on Isai. 49.3. Thou art my Servant, Oh, Israel. 27.3m [May] 1694. I fain would praise thee, Lord, but finde black Sin, To stain my Tunes my Virginalls to spoile. Fetch out the same with thy red blood and bring My Heart in kilter, and my Spirits oyle. My Theme is rich: my Skill is poore untill Thy Spirit makes my hand its holy quill. I spy thyselfe, as Golden Bosses fixt On Bible Covers, shine in Types out bright, Of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, where's immixt Their streaming Beames of Christ displaying Light. Jacobs now jog my pen, whose golden rayes Do of thyselfe advance an holy blaze. His Name as Jacob, saith there's stow'd in thee All Wisdom to mentain all Pious Skill And that the Divells Heels should tript up bee By thee alone, thou dost his brains out spill. The Name of Israel in Scutcheons shows Thou art Gods Prince to batter down his Foes. His Fathers blessing him, shews thou camest down Full of thy Fathers blessing: and his Griefe That thou shouldst be a man of Grief: a Crown Of Thorns thou wer'st to purchase us reliefe. Isr'el by Joseph's had to Egypt, and Joseph thee thither, and from thence did hand. Jacob doth from his Father go and seek A Spouse and purchasd by his service two. Thou from thy Father came'st thy Spouse most meek Of Jews, and Gentiles down to purchase, Wooe And gain, and as Twelve Stems did from him bud Thou twelve Apostles sentst, the Church to stud. In all those Typick Lumps of Glory I Spy thee the Gem made up of all their shine Which from them all in thickest glory fly And twist themselves into this Gem of thine. And as the Shine thereof doth touch my heart, Joy sincks my Soule seeing how rich thou art. How rich art thou? How poore am I of Love To thee, when all this Glory at my Doore Stands knocking for admission: and doth shove To ope't, and Cabbinet in't all her Store? Make Love inflamed rise, and all entwine About Thyselfe her Object all in Shine. Lord pardon mee, my Sin, and all my trash: And bring my Soule in Surges of rich flame Of love to thee. I truely Envie dash Upon my selfe, my hidebound selfe for shame, I fain would prize and praise thee, but do sende My Flame up smootherd by a Carnall minde. Oh! blow my Coale with thy blesst Bellows till It Glow, and send Loves hottest Steams on thee. I shall be warm; and thou mine arms shalt fill And mine Embraces shall thy Worship bee. I'le sacrifice to thee my Heart in praise, When thy Rich Grace shall be my hearty Phrase. 7. Meditation. Ps. 105.17. He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold etc. 5.6m [Aug.] 1694. All Dull, my Lord, my Spirits flat, and dead All water sockt and sapless to the skin. Oh! Screw mee up and make my Spirits bed Thy quickening vertue For my inke is dim, My pensill blunt. Doth Joseph type out thee? Haraulds of Angells sing out, Bow the Knee. Is Josephs glorious shine a Type of thee? How bright art thou? He Envi'de was as well. And so was thou. He's stript, and pick't, poore hee, Into the pit. And so was thou. They shell Thee of thy Kirnell. He by Judah's sold For twenty Bits, thirty for thee he'd told. Joseph was tempted by his Mistress vile. Thou by the Divell, but both shame the foe. Joseph was cast into the jayle awhile. And so was thou. Sweet apples mellow so. Joseph did from his jayle to glory run. Thou from Death's pallot rose like morning sun. Joseph layes in against the Famine, and Thou dost prepare the Bread of Life for thine. He bought with Corn for Pharaoh th'men and Land. Thou with thy Bread mak'st such themselves Consign Over to thee, that eate it. Joseph makes His brethren bow before him. Thine too quake. Joseph constrains his Brethren till their sins Do gall their Souls. Repentance babbles fresh. Thou treatest sinners till Repentance springs Then with him sendst a Benjamin like messe. Joseph doth Cheare his humble brethren. Thou Dost stud with Joy the mourning Saints that bow. Josephs bright shine th'Eleven Tribes must preach. And thine Apostles now Eleven, thine. They beare his presents to his Friends: thine reach Thine unto thine, thus now behold a shine. How hast thou pensild out, my Lord, most bright Thy glorious Image here, on Josephs Light. This I bewaile in me under this shine To see so dull a Colour in my Skin. Lord, lay thy brightsome Colours on me thine. Scoure thou my pipes then play thy tunes therein. I will not hang my Harp in Willows by. While thy sweet praise, my Tunes doth glorify. 8. Meditation. Rom. 5.8. God commends his Love unto us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. 14.8m [Oct.] 1694. Thou pry'st thou screw'st my sincking Soul up to, Lord th'Highest Vane amazements Summit Wears Seeing thy Love ten thousand wonders do Breaking Sins Back that blockt it up: us snares. The Very Stars, and Sun themselves did scoule, Yea Angells too, till it shone out, did howle. Poore sinfull man lay grovling on the ground. Thy wrath, and Curse to dust lay grinding him. And Sin, that banisht Love out of these bounds Hath stufft the world with curses to the brim. Gods Love thus Caskt in Heaven, none can tap Or breake its truss hoops, or attain a Scrap. Like as a flock of Doves with feathers washt, All o're with yellow gold, fly all away At one Gun crack: so Lord thy Love Sin quasht And Chased hence to heaven (Darksom day). It nestles there: and Graces Bird did hatch Which in dim types we first Pen feather'd catch. God takes his Son stows in him all his Love, (Oh Lovely One), him Lovely thus down sends His rich Love Letter to us from above And chiefly in his Death his Love Commends, Writ all in Love from top to toe, and told Out Love more rich, and shining far than gold. For e'ry Grain stands bellisht ore with Love, Each Letter, Syllable, Word, Action sounde Gods Commendations to us from above, But yet Loves Emphasis most cleare is found Engrav'd upon his Grave Stone in his blood He shed for Sinners, Lord what Love? How good? It rent the Heavens ope that seald up were Against poore Sinners: rend the very Skie And rout the Curse, Sin, Divell, Hell (Oh Deare,) And brake Deaths jaw bones, and its Sting destroy. Will search its Coffers: fetch from thence the Dust Of Saints, and it attend to glory just. My God! this thy Love Letter to mee send. Thy Love to mee spell out therein I will. And What choice Love thou dost mee there commend, I'le lay up safely in my Souls best till. I'le read, and read it; and With Angells soon My Mictams shall thy Hallelujahs tune. 9. Meditation. Deut. 18.[15] The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophetâlike unto mee. 16.10m [Dec.] 1694. Lord, let thy Dazzling Shine refracted fan'de In this bright Looking Glass, its favour lay Upon mine Eyes that oculated stand And peep thereat, in button moulds of clay. Whose glory otherwise that Courts mine eye Will all its sparkling family destroy. Yea let thy Beams, better ten thousand times Than brightest Eyebright, cherishing revive The Houshold that possesseth all the Shrines In Visions Palace, that it well may thrive. Moses is made the Looking glass: in which Mine Eyes to spie thee in this Type I pitch. Poor Parents bring him in, when bondage state On Israel lay: and so it was with thee. He's persecuted. All male babes a late Are to be slain. Thy case was such we see. He's sav'de by miracle: and raisd up by A sire reputed. So thy matters ly. Was he most Meeke, Courageous, Faithfull, Wise? These all shine bright in thee, out shine the Sun. Did he his Father then in law suffice With faithfull service? So thou well hast done. Did he a gentile Wed? Thy Spouse so shines. Was he a Mediator? This thee twines. Did he Gods Israel from Egypt through The Red Sea lead, into the Wilderness? Thou bringst Gods Israel from bondage too Of Sin into the World here through no less Than thy red blood: and in this Chace t'assoile The firy Serpents, whose black venoms boile. He Fasted fourty days, and nights, did give Them Gods own Law: Thou didst the very same. The Morall Law whereto we ought to live. The Gospell Law to laver out our Shame. Then Israel's Church-hood, Worship, Ministry He founded: which thou didst too gospelly. He did confirm his Office Worke with Wonders, And to the Covenant annexed Seals. Thou thine in miracles, and more in numbers. And Gospell Seals unto thy Church out dealst. He intercession made, and pardon gain'd Unto his people. Thou didst so, its fam'de. He led them to the border of God's Land, Sang like a Swan his dying Song (Well known) Laid down his hilts: and so discharg'd his hand. Dy'de, Buri'de, Rose, and went to glories throne. All which shine gloriously in thee that wee Do Moses finde a Well drawn Map of thee. Good God! what grace is this takes place in thee? How dost thou make thy Son to shine, and prize His glory thus? Thy Looking-glass give mee. And let thy Spirit wipe my Watry eyes. That I may see his flashing glory darte Like Lightening quick till it infire my heart. I long to see thy Sun upon mee shine, But feare I'st finde myselfe thereby shown worse. Yet let his burning beams melt, and refine Me from my dross, yet not to singe my purse. Then of my metall make thy Warbling harp: That shall thy Praise deck't in sweet tunes out warp. 10. Meditation. Which our Fathers that Follow'd after, brought in with Jesus, into the Possession of the Gentiles. Acts. 7.45. 10.12m [Feb.] 1694. Moses farewell. I with a mournfull teare Will wash thy Marble Vault, and leave thy Shine To follow Josuah to Jordan where He weares a Type, of Jesus Christ, divine. Did by the Priests bearing the Arke off Cut Her Stream, that Isr'el through it drieshod foot. Doth twelve men call who in the Channell raise Twelve Stones, and also other twelve up take And Gilgal stud therewith, like pearles that blaze In Rings of Gold, this passage to relate. All speaking Types of Christ whose Ministry Doth Jordans Streams cut off, that 'fore them fly. And brings the Church into the Promisd Coast And singles out his twelve Apostles who Twelve flaming Carbuncles before his host Out of the Channell take, and them bestow As Monuments upon its banck most fair, Twelve Articles th'Apostles Creed doth bare. Now Farewell Wilderness, with all thy Fare. The Water of the Rock, and Mannah too. My Old-New Cloaths my Wildernesses Ware, The Cloud and Pillar bright, adjue adjue. You onely in the Wilderness did flower As flowring Types. With Angells now I bower. Let Gilgal speake for mee, where Egypts Stain Lapt in my Foreskin up clipt off off took. I feed on Can'ans Wheat, Mannah's plump grain. All Evangelicall our Bakers Cooke. I drink the Drink of Life and weare Christs Web And by the Sun of Righteousness am led. Our Joshua doth draw his Troops out to The Lunar coast, this Jericho the World And rounds it while the Gospell Levites blow Their Gospell Rams Horn Trumpets till down hurld Its walls lie flat, and it his sacrifice Doth burn in Zeale, whose Flame doth sindge the Skies. As Joshuah doth fight Haile Stones smite down The Can'anites: so Christ with Haile Stones shall Destroy his Enemies, and breake their Crown. The Sun and Moon shall stand to see them fall The Heavens Chrystall Candlestick-like stand Holding for him their Candles in their hand. Yet such as Rahab like come o're to him His Grace implanteth in his Golden Stock. As Joshuah did each Tribe his lot out fling So Christ doth his in Glory portions lot. As Joshua fixt Gods Worship, and envest Them with the Promise. Christ thus his hath blest. That blazing Star in Joshua's but a Beam Of thy bright Sun, my Lord, fix such in mee. My Dish clout Soul Rence Wring, and make it clean. Then die it in that blood that fell from thee. And make the Waiting men within my heart Attend thy sweetest praise, in evry part. 11. Meditation. Jud. 13.3. The Angell of the Lord appeared to the Woman, etc. 19.3m [May] 1695. Eternall Love burnisht in Glory thick, Doth butt, and Center in thee, Lord, my joy. Thou portrai'd art in Colours bright, that stick Their Glory on the Choicest Saints, Whereby They are thy Pictures made. Samson Exceld Herein thy Type, as he thy foes once queld. An Angell tells his mother of his birth. An Angell telleth thine of thine. Ye two Both Males that ope the Womb in Wedlock Kerfe Both Nazarited from the Womb up grew. He after pitchy night a Sunshine grows And thou the Sun of Righteousness up rose. His Love did Court a Gentile spouse, and thine Espous'd a Gentile to bebride thyselfe. His Gentile Bride apostatizd betime. Apostasy in thine grew full of Wealth. He sindgd the Authours of't with Foxes tails. And foxy men by thee on thine prevaile. The Fret now rose. Thousands upon him poure. An asses Jaw his javling is, whereby He slew a Thousand, heap by heap that hour. Thou by weake means makest many thousands fly. Thou ribbon like wast platted in his Locks And hence he thus his Enemies did box. He's by his Friend betray'd, for money sold, Took, bound, blindfolded, made a May game Flout Dies freely with great sinners, when they hold A Sacred Feast. With arms stretcht greatly out, Slew more by death, than in his Life he slew. And all such things, my Lord, in thee are true. Samson at Gaza went to bed to sleep. The Gazites watch him and the Soldiers thee. He Champion stout, at midnight rose full deep. Took Gaza's Gate on's back away went hee. Thou rose didst from thy Grave and also tookst Deaths Doore away throwing it off o'th'hooks. Thus all the shine that Samson wore is thine, Thine in the Type. Oh. Glorious One, Rich glee. Gods Love hath made thee thus. Hence thy bright shine Commands our Love to bow thereto the Knee. Thy Glory chargeth us in Sacrifice To make our Hearts and Love to thee to rise. But woe is me! my heart doth run out to Poor bits of Clay: or dirty Gayes embrace. Doth leave thy Lovely Selfe for loveless show: For lumps of Lust, nay sorrow and disgrace. Alas, poore Soule! a Pardon, Lord, I crave. I have dishonourd thee and all I have. Be thou my Samson, Lord, a Rising Sun, Of Righteousness unto my Soule, I pray. Conquour my Foes. Let Graces Spouts all run Upon my Soule O're which thy sunshine lay. And set me in thy Sunshine, make each flower Of Grace in me thy Praise perfum'd out poure. 12. Meditation. Ezek. 37.24. David my Servant shall be their King. 7.5m [July] 1695. Dull, Dull indeed! What shall it e're be thus? And why? Are not thy Promises, my Lord, Rich, Quick'ning things? How should my full Cheeks blush To finde mee thus? And those a lifeless Word? My Heart is heedless: unconcernd hereat: I finde my Spirits Spiritless, and flat. Thou Courtst mine Eyes in Sparkling Colours bright, Most bright indeed, and soul enamoring, With the most Shining Sun, whose beames did smite Me with delightfull Smiles to make mee spring. Embellisht knots of Love assault my minde Which still is Dull, as if this Sun ne're shin'de. David in all his gallantry now comes, Bringing to tende thy Shrine, his Royall Glory, Rich Prowess, Prudence, Victories, Sweet Songs, And Piety to Pensill out thy Story; To draw my Heart to thee in this brave shine Of typick Beams, most warm. But still I pine. Shall not this Lovely Beauty, Lord, set out In Dazzling Shining Flashes 'fore mine Eye, Enchant my heart, Love's golden mine, till't spout Out Streames of Love refin'd that on thee lie? Thy Glory's great: Thou Davids Kingdom shalt Enjoy for aye. I want and thats my fault. Spare me, my Lord, spare me, I greatly pray, Let me thy Gold pass through thy Fire untill Thy Fire refine, and take my filth away. That I may shine like Gold, and have my fill Of Love for thee; untill my Virginall Chime out in Changes sweet thy Praises shall. Wipe off my Rust, Lord, with thy wisp me scoure, And make thy Beams pearch on my Strings their blaze. My tunes Cloath with thy Shine, and Quavers poure My Cursing Strings on, loaded with thy Praise. My Fervent Love with Musick in her hand, Shall then attend thyselfe, and thy Command. 13. Meditation. Ps. 72. The title. A Psalm for Solomon. 1.7m [Sept.] 1695. I fain would praise thee, Lord, but when I would, I finde my Sin my Praise dispraises bring. I fain would lift my hands up as I should, But when I do, I finde them fould by Sin. I strive to heave my heart to thee, but finde When striving, in my heart an heartless minde. Oh! that my Love, and mine Affections rich Did spend themselves on thee and thou hadst them. I strive to have thy Glory on them pitch And fetch thee them. Hence Solomon thy jem, And glorious Type thy Sparkling Beams out flings But in the same my Love but little springs. Was He a bud of Davids stock? So thou. Was he a King? Thou art a King of Kings. Was He a Make-peace King? Thy royall brow Doth weare a Crown which peace Eternall brings. Did He Excell in Wisdome? Thine doth flame. And thou art Wisdom's Storehouse whence his came. I may aver he's of all fallen men The perfect'st piece that Nature ever bred. Thy Human nature is the perfect'st jem That Adams offspring ever brudled. No spot nor Wrinckle did it ever smite. Adams in Paradise was ne're so bright. Did He Gods Temple Build, in glory shown? Thou buildst Gods House, more gloriously bright. Did he sit on a golden ivery Throne With Lions fenc'd? Thy Throne is far more White And glorious: garded with Angells strong. A Streame of fire doth with the Verdict come. Did he his Spouse, a glorious Palace build? The Heavens are thy Palace for thy Spouse. Gods house was by his pray're with Glory filld. God will for thine his Church in Glory house. Did Sheba's Queen faint viewing of his glory? Bright Angells stand amazed at thy Story. But hence griefe springs, finding these rayes of Light Scarce reach my heart, it is so ditcht with Sin. I scarce can see I see it, or it smite Upon my Love that it doth run to him. Why so? my Lord! Why so? Shall Love up shrink? Or mine Affection to thee be a Shrimp? Oh! feed me at thy Table, make Grace grow Knead in thy Bread, I eate, thy Love to mee, And spice thy Cup I take, with rich grace so, That at thy Table I may honour thee. And if thy Banquet fill mee with thy Wealth, My growing Grace will glorify thyselfe. 14. Meditation. Col. 2.3. In whom are hid all the Treasures of Wisdom, and Knowledge. 3d.9m [Nov.] 1695. Halfe Dead: and rotten at the Coare: my Lord! I am Consumptive: and my Wasted lungs Scarce draw a Breath of aire: my Silver Coard Is loose. My buckles almost have no tongues. My Heart is Fistulate: I am a Shell. In Guilt and Filth I wallow, Sent and Smell. Shall not that Wisdom horded up in thee (One key whereof is Sacerdotall Types) Provide a Cure for all this griefe in mee And in the Court of Justice save from Stripes, And purge away all Filth and Guilt, and bring A Cure to my Consumption as a King? Shall not that Wisdom horded in thee (which Prophetick Types enucleate) forth shine With Light enough a Saving Light to fix On my Poore Taper? And a Flame Divine? Making my Soule thy Candle and its Flame Thy Light to guide mee, till I Glory gain? Shall not that Wisdom horded in thee up (Which Kingly Types do shine upon in thee) Mee with its Chrystall Cupping Glasses cup And draine ill Humours wholy out of mee? Ore come my Sin? And mee adorn with Grace And fit me for thy Service, and thy Face? How do these Pointers type thee out most right As Graces Officine of Wisdom pure The fingers Salves and Medicines so right That never faile, when usd, to worke a Cure? Oh! that it would my Wasted lungs recrute. And make my feeble Spirits upward shute. How Glorious art thou, Lord? Cloathd with the Glory Of Prophets, Priests, and Kings? Nay all Types come To lay their Glory on thee. (Brightsome Story). Their Rayes attend thee, as Sun Beams the Sun. And shall my Ulcer'd Soule have such reliefe? Such glorious Cure? Lord strengthen my beliefe. Why dost not love, my Soule? or Love grow strong? These glorious Beams of Wisdom on thee shine. Will not this Sunshine make thy branch green long, And flowrish as it doth to heaven climbe? Oh! chide thyselfe out of thy Lethargie, And unto Christ on Angells wings up fly. Draw out thy Wisdom, Lord, and make mee just. Draw out thy Wisdom. Wisdoms Crown give mee. With shining Holiness Candy my Crust: And make mee to thy Scepter bow the knee. Let thy rich Grace mee save from Sin, and Death: And I will tune thy Praise with holy Breath. 15. Meditation. Mat. 2.23. He shall bee called a Nazarite. Westfield 12.10m [Dec.] 1695/6. A Nazarite indeed. Not such another. More rich than Jasper, finer far than Silke More cleane than Heavens froth the Skies out pother: Purer than snow: and Whiter far than Milke. In Bodie ruddier than Rubies, nay Whose pollishing of Sapphire's brave, and gay. Devoted by thy Father and thy selfe To all Examplary Holy Life. Grace's Chiefe Flower pot on highest shelfe In all God's Hall. Here Holiness is rife. And higher Herbs of Grace can never grow In Bulk, or Brightness, than before us flow. Thy Typick Holiness, more sweet than Muske, Ore tops the paltry Dainties of Strong Drinke: Or Vines whose Fruite is Casked in an huske, And Kirnells with hard Stones: though from their Chink: Bleeds royall Wine: and grapes Sweet Raisens make The Wine will soure. Types may not of it take. The letter of the Law of Nazarites Concerns thee not. The Spirit oft is meet For thee alone. Thou art the Vine t'invite The Grape without Husk, Stone, The Raisen Sweet. Yea, thou thyselfe, the Wine, and Strong Drink art. E're sweet, nere Vinegar, or soureing sharp. Thy Head that wares a Nazaritick Crown Of Holiness Deckt with its purple Hair Dide in the Blood thy Grape shed when presst down Derides the Rasor. Saints there nestled are. And when thy Vow is o're, under the wing Of their Peace offering thy praise they'l sing. Thou never wast defiled by the Dead. No Dead thing ever, yet disstained thee. Life from thy Fingers ends runs, and ore spred Itselfe through all thy Works what e're they bee. Thy Thoughts, Words, Works are lively, frim, do still Out Spirituall Life. Thy Spirit doth them fill. Pare off, my Lord, from mee I pray, my pelfe. Make mee thy Nazarite by imitation Not of the Ceremony, but thy selfe, In Holiness of Heart, and Conversation. Then I shall weare thy Nazarite like Crown In Glory bright with Songs of thy Renown. 16. Meditation. Lu. 1.33. He shall reign over the house of Jacob forever. Westfield 9.1m [Mar.] 1695/6. Thou art, my Lord, the King of Glory bright. A glory't is unto the Angells flame To be thy Harauld publishing thy Light Unto the Sons of Men: and thy rich Name. They are thy Subjects. Yea thy realm is faire. Ore Jacobs House thou reignest: they declare. Their brightest glory lies in thee their king. My Glory is that thou my king maist bee. That I may be thy Subject thee to sing And thou may'st have thy kingdoms reign in mee. But when my Lips I make thy Scepter Kiss Unheartiness hatcht in my heart doth hiss. Rich Reason, and Religion Good thus cry, Be Subject, Soule: of Jacobs house be one. Here is a king for thee, Whom Angells fly To greet and honour sitting on his throne. Sins mutiny, and marr his intrest brave. My Pray'res grow Dead. Dead Corps laid in the grave. The lowly Vine Grows fruitfull clusters, Rich. The Humble Olive fat with oyle abounds. But I like to the fiery Bramble, Which Jumps at a Crown am but an empty Sound. A guilded Cask of tawny Pride, and Gall, With Veans of Venom o're my Spirits sprawle. Like to the Daugh all glorious made when dresst In feathers borrowed of other birds Must need be King of birds: but is distresst, When ery bird its feather hath, and Curbd Doth glout, and slouch her Wings. Pride acts this part. And base Hypocrisy. Oh! rotten heart! Blesst Lord, my King, where is thy golden Sword? Oh! Sheath it in the bowells of my Sin. Slay my Rebellion, make thy Law my Word. Against thine Enemies Without within. Implant mee as a branch in Gods true vine And then my grape will yield thy Cup rich wine. Shall I now grafted in thy Olive tree The house of Jacob, bramble berries beare? This burdens me to thinke of, much more thee. Breake off my black brire Claws: mee scrape, and pare. Lord make my Bramble bush thy rosie tree. And it will beare sweet Roses then for thee. Kill my Hypocrisie, Pride Poison, Gall. And make my Daugh thy Turtle Dove ore laid With golden feathers: and my fruites then shall Flock Dovelike to thy Lockers, oh! Choice trade. My Cooing then shall be thy Musick in, The House of Jacob, tun'de to thee, my King. 17. Meditation. Eph. 5.2. And gave himselfe for us an offering, and a Sacrifice to God. Westfield 16.6[m] [Aug.] 1696. Thou Greate Supream, thou Infinite first One: Thy Being Being gave to all that be Yea to the best of Beings thee alone To serve with Service best for best of fee. But man the best servd thee the Worst of all And so the Worst of incomes on him falls. Hence I who'me Capable to serve thee best Of all the ranks of Beings here below And best of Wages win, have been a pest And done the Worst, earn'd thus the Worst of Woe. Sin that imploys mee findes mee worke indeed Me qualifies, ill qualities doth breed. This is an hell indeed thus to be held From that which nature holdst her chiefe delights To that that is her horrour and refelld Ev'n by the Law God in her Essence writes. But for reliefe Grace in her tender would Massiah cast all Sacrifices told. I sin'd. Christ, bailes. Grace takes him Surety, Translates my Sin upon his sinless Shine. He's guilty thus, and Justice thus doth eye And sues the band, and brings on him the fine. All Sacrifices burn but yet their blood Can't quench the fire, When laid upon the Wood. The type thy Veane phlebotomizd must bee To quench this Fire: no other blood nor thing Can do't. Hence thou alone art made for mee Burnt, Meat, Peace Sin, and Trespass Offering. Thy blood must fall: thy life must go or I Under the Wrath of God must ever fry. This fire upon thee burnt, and is allay'd For all of thine. Oh make mee thine I pray. So shall this Wrath from mee be retrograde. No fire shall sindge my rags nor on them stay. New qualify mee. I shall then on go Anew about thy Service, and it do. What Grace in God? What Love in Christ thus spring Up unto men, and to my poore poore heart? That so thy burning fire no Sparke can fling Or sparkle on such Tinder, This impart Unto thy Servant. This will be my Health: And for a gift to thee I send myselfe. Oh! that my Love, was rowld all ore and ore In thine, and Candi'd in't, and so refin'd More bright than gold, and grown in bulke, far more Than tongue can tell of each best sort, and kind. All should be thine, and I thine own will be. Accept my gift, no better is with mee. Then own thine own. Be thou my Sacrifice, Thy Father too, that he may father mee, And I may be his Child, and thy blood prize, That thy attonement may my clearing bee. In hope of Which I in thy Service sing Unto thy Praise upon my Harp within. 18. Meditation. Heb. 13.10. Wee have an Altar. Westfield 18.8m [Oct.] 1696. A Bran, a Chaff, a very Barly yawn, An Husk, a Shell, a Nothing, nay yet Worse, A Thistle, Bryer prickle, pricking Thorn A Lump of Lewdeness, Pouch of Sin, a purse Of Naughtiness, I am, yea what not Lord? And wilt thou be mine Altar? and my bord? Mine Heart's a Park or Chase of sins: Mine Head 'S a Bowling Alley. Sins play Ninehole here. Phansy's a Green: sin Barly breaks in't led. Judgment's a pingle. Blindeman's Buff's plaid there. Sin playes at Coursey Parke within my Minde. My Wills a Walke in which it aires what's blinde. Sure then I lack Atonement. Lord me help. Thy Shittim Wood ore laid With Wealthy brass Was an Atoning altar, and sweet smelt: But if ore laid with pure pure gold it was It was an Incense Altar, all perfum'd With Odours, wherein Lord thou thus was bloom'd. Did this ere during Wood when thus orespread With these erelasting Metalls altarwise Type thy Eternall Plank of Godhead, Wed Unto our Mortall Chip, its sacrifice? Thy Deity mine Altar. Manhood thine. Mine Offring on't for all men's Sins, and mine? This Golden Altar puts such weight into The sacrifices offer'd on't, that it Ore weighs the Weight of all the sins that flow In thine Elect. This Wedge, and beetle split The knotty Logs of Vengeance too to shivers: And from their Guilt and shame them cleare delivers. This Holy Altar by its Heavenly fire Refines our Offerings: casts out their dross And sanctifies their Gold by its rich 'tire And all their steams with Holy Odours boss. Pillars of Frankincense and rich Perfume They 'tone Gods nosthrills with, off from this Loom. Good News, Good Sirs, more good than comes within The Canopy of Angells. Heavens Hall Allows no better: this atones for sin, My Glorious God, Whose Grace here thickest falls. May I my Barly yawn, Bran, Bryer Claw, Lay on't a Sacrifice? or Chaff or Straw? Shall I my sin Pouch lay, on thy Gold Bench My Offering, Lord, to thee? I've such alone But have no better. For my sins do drench My very best unto their very bone. And shall mine Offering by thine Altars fire Refin'd, and sanctifi'd to God aspire? Amen, ev'n so be it. I now will climb The stares up to thine Altar, and on't lay Myselfe, and services, even for its shrine. My sacrifice brought thee accept I pray. My Morn, and Evning Offerings I'le bring And on this Golden Altar Incense fling. Lord let thy Deity mine Altar bee And make thy Manhood, on't my sacrifice. For mine Atonement: make them both for mee My Altar t'sanctify my gifts likewise That so myselfe and service on't may bring Its worth along with them to thee my king. The thoughts whereof, do make my tunes as fume, From off this Altar rise to thee Most High And all their steams stufft with thy Altars blooms, My Sacrifice of Praise in Melody. Let thy bright Angells catch my tune, and sing't. That Equalls Davids Michtam which is in't. 19. Meditation. Can. 1.12. While the King sits at his Table, my Spicknard sends forth the Smell thereof. Westfield 7.10m [Dec.] 1696. Lord dub my tongue with a new tier of Words More comprehensive far than my dull Speech That I may dress thy Excellency Lord In Languague welted with Emphatick reech. Thou art my King: my Heart thy Table make And sit thereat untill my Spicknard wake. My Garden Knot drawn out most curiously By thy brave hand set with the bravest Slips Of Spicknard: Lavender that thence may fly Their Wealthy Spirits from their trunks and tips. That Spicknard Oyle, and Oyle of Spike most sweet May muskify thy Palace with their Reeke. Then sit at thy round Table with delight And feast in mee, untill my Spicknard bloome, And Crown thy head with Odour-Oyle rich bright And croud thy Chamber with her sweet perfume. The Spicknard in my knot then flourish will: And frindge thy Locks with odour it doth still. And when thou at thy Circuite Table sitst Thine Ordinances, Lord, to greet poor hearts Such Influences from thyselfe thou slipst And make their Spicknard its sweet Smell impart. So make my Lavender to spring, and sent. In such attire her Spirits ever tent. And as thou at thy Table sitst to feast Thy Guests there at, Thy Supper, Lord, well drest, Let my sweet Spicknard breath most sweet, at least Those Odours that advance thy Glory best. And make my heart thine Alabaster Box Of my Rich Spicknard to perfume thy locks. If this thou grant, (and grant thou this I pray) And sit my King at thy rich table thus, Then my Choice Spicknard shall its Smell display, That sweetens mee and on thee sweet doth rush. My Songs of Praise too sweeten'd with this fume Shall scale thine Eares in Spicknardisick Tune. 20. Meditation. Heb. 9.11. By a Greater, and more Perfect Tabernacle. 7.12m [Feb.] 1696. Didst thou, Lord, Cast mee in a Worship-mould That I might Worship thee immediatly? Hath Sin blurd all thy Print, that so I should Be made in vain unto this End? and Why? Lord print me ore again. Begon, begon, Yee Fly blows all of hell: I'le harbour none. That I might not receive this mould in vain Thy Son, my Lord, my Tabernacle he Shall be: me run into thy mould again. Then in this Temple I will Worship thee. If he the Medium of my Worship stand Mee, and my Worship he will to thee hand. I can't thee Worship now without an House. An house of Worship here will do no good, Unless it type my Woe, in which I douse, And Remedy in deifyed Blood. Thy Tabernacle, and thy Temple they Such Types arose. Christ is their Sun, and Ray. Thou wast their Authour: Art Christs too and his. They were of Choicest Matters. His's th'best blood. Thy Spirits over shaddowing form'd them, This Did overshaddow Mary. Christ did bud. The Laver, Altar, Shew Bread, Table Gold And Golden Light and Oyle do Christs Shine hold. The Efficacy that's lodgd in them all Came from thyselfe in influences, nay Their Glory's but a painted Sun on th'Wall Compar'd to thine and that thou dost display. How glorious then art thou, when all their glory Is but a Paintery to thy bright Story. Thou art the Laver to wash off my Sin: The Altars for atonement out of hand: The Sweet Sweet Incense cast the fire within The Golden Table, where the Shew bread stand. The Golden Candlestick with holy Light Mentain'd by holy Oyle in Graces Pipe. The flames whereof, enmixt with Grace assaile With Grace the heart in th'Light that takes the Eye To light us in the way within the Vaile Unto the Arke in which the Angells prie Having the Law stand in't, up Coverd under The Mercy Seate, that Throne of Graces Wonder. Thou art my Tabernacle, Temple right, My Cleansing, Holiness, Atonement, Food, My Righteousness, My Guide of Temple Light In to the Holy Holies, (as is shewd) My Oracle, Arke, Mercy Seat: the place Of Cherubims amazde at such rich grace. Thou art my Medium to God, thou art My Medium of Worship done to thee, And of Divine Communion, Sweet heart! Oh Heavenly intercourse! Yee Angells see! Art thou my Temple, Lord? Then thou Most Choice Art Angells Play-House, and Saints Paradise. Thy Temples Influences stick on mee, That I in Holy Love may stow my heart Upon thyselfe, and on my God in thee, And with thy Holiness guild Every part Of me. And I will as I walke herein Thy Glory thee in Temple Musick bring. 21. Meditation. Col. 2.16.17. In respect of an Holy Day, of a New Moon, or a Sabbath. Which are figures. 16.3m [May] 1697. Rich Temple Fair! Rich Festivalls my Lord, Thou makest to entertain thy Guests most dresst In dishes up by SEVENS which afford Rich Mystery under their brims expresst. Which to discover clearly, make the brain Of most men wring, their kirnells to obtain. Each Seventh Day a Sabbath Gracious Ware. A Seventh Week a yearly Festivall. The Seventh Month a Feast nigh, all, rich fare. The Seventh Yeare a Feast Sabbaticall. And when seven years are seven times turnd about A Jubilee. Now turn their inside out. What Secret Sweet Mysterie under the Wing Of this so much Elected number lies? What Vean can e're Divine? Or Poet sing? Doubtless most Rich. For such shew God most Wise. I will adore the same although my quill Can't hit the String that's tun'd by such right Skill. Sharpen my Sight my Lord that I may spie A lively Quickness in it jump for joy And by the breaking of the Shell let fly Such pleasant Species as will folly stroy. Out of these Feasts, although the Number Seven I leave untill my Soul is housd in Heaven. And here I beg thy aide Mine eyes refine Untill my Sight is strong enough to spy Thyselfe my Lord deckt all in Sun Like Shine. And see myselfe cloathd in thy Beams that fly. My Sight is dim: With Spectacles mee suite Made of a pair of Stars it to recrute. Make mee thy Lunar Body to be filld In full Conjunction, with thy Shining Selfe The Sun of Righteousness: whose beams let guild My Face turnd up to heaven, on which high Shelfe I shall thy Glorys in my face that shine, Set in Reflected Rayes. Hence thou hast thine. Moon-like I have no light here of mine own. My shining beams are borrowd of this Sun, With which when 'ray'd its Rayes on mee are shown Unto this World as I it over run. My black Side's Earthward Yet thy beams that flew Upon mee from thy face, are in its view. Hence Angells will in heaven blow up aloud For joy thy Trumpet on my new Moon day And in its Prime, the Golden Rayes that shroud Within thy Face will guild my Edges gay. Oh! Happy Change. The Sun of Righteousness With's healing Wings my moon doth richly dress. And though this world doth eye thy brightness most When most in distance from thyselfe I'm backt, Yet then I most am apt even from this Coast To be Ecclipsed, or by its fogs be blackt. My back at best, and dark side Godward bee, And pitchy clouds do hide thy face from mee. Oh! let not Earth nor its thick fogs I pray E're slip between me, and thy lightsome Rayes But let my Cloathing be thy Sunshine Ray. My New-Moon Trumpet then shall sound thy praise. I then in sweet Conjunction shall with thee The Sun of Righteousness abiding bee.[The following four stanzas appear after the conclusion of this poem in PW. They have been crossed out and appear, in slightly altered form, as the conclusion of Meditation 22.] But now I from the New Moon Feast do pass And pass the Passo're o're unto Gods Seales, And come to Whitsuntide, and turn its glass To search for pearles amongst its sands and meals. For Israel had not fifty dayes been out Of Egypt, ere at Sinai Law did spout. So Christ our Passover had not passt ore Full fifty dayes before in fiery wise The Law of Spirit and of Life much more Went out from Zion. Gospell Law did rise. The Harvest of the former yeare is in'd. Injoy'd, and Consecrated Thanks for't pay'd. All holding out the Right in things we sind Away restored is, and they all made Fit for our use, and that we thankfully Ourselves unto the using them should ply. Then make me to this Penticost repare. Make mee thy Guest, Lord, at this feast, and live Up to thy Gospell Law. And let my Fare Be of the two Wave Loaves this Feast doth give. If th'Prophets Seedtime spring my harvest I Will, as I reape't, sing thee my harvest joy. 22. Meditation. 1 Cor. 5.7. Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us. I from the New Moon of the first month high Unto its fourteenth day When she is Full Of Light the Which the Shining Sun let fly And when the Sun's all black to see Sins pull The Sun of Righteousness from Heaven down Into the Grave and weare a Pascall Crown. A Bond Slave in Egyptick Slavery This Noble Stem, Angellick Bud, this Seed Of Heavenly Birth, my Soul, doth groaning ly. When shall its Passo're come? When shall't be Freed? The Lamb is slaine upon the fourteenth day Of Month the first, my Doore posts do display. Send out thy Slaughter Angell, Lord, and slay All my Enslaving 'Gypsies Sins, while I Eate this rost Mutten, Paschall Lamb, Display Thy Grace herein, while I from Egypt high. I'le feed upon thy Roast meat here updresst, With Bitter hearbs, unleaven'd bread the best. I'le banish Leaven from my very Soule And from its Leanetoe tent: and search out all With Candles lest a Crum thereof should rowle Into its Corners or in mouseholes fall, Which when I finde I'le burn up, and will sweep From every Corner all, and all cleane keep. My Bunch of Hyssop, Faith, dipt in thy blood My Paschall Lamb, held in thy Bason bright Baptize my Doore Posts shall, make Crimson good. Let nothing off this Varnish from them wipe, And while they weare thy Crimson painted dy, No Slaughter Angell shall mine house annoy. Lord, purge my Leaven out: my Tast make quick: My Souls strong Posts baptize with this rich blood By bunch of Hyssop, then I'le also lick Thy Dripping Pan: and eat thy Roast Lamb good, With Staff in hand, Loins Girt, and Feet well shod With Gospell ware as walking to my God. I'le Goshen's Ramesis now leave apace. Thy Flag I'le follow to thy Succoth tent. Thy sprinkled blood being my lintells grace Thy Flesh my Food With bitter herbs attent To minde me of my bitter bondage State And my Deliverance from all such fate. I'le at this Feast my First Sheafe bring, and Wave Before thee, Lord, my Crop to sanctify That in my first Fruits I my harvest have May blest unto my Cyckle Constantly. So at this Feast my harp shall Tunes advance Upon thy Lamb, and my Deliverance. But now I from the Passover do pass. Easter farewell, rich jewells thou did shew, And come to Whitsuntide; and turn the Glass To search her Sands for pearles therein anew. For Isra'l a fift'th day from Egypt broke, Gave Sinai's Law, and Crown'd the mount with Smoke. And Christ oure Passover had not passt o're Full fifty dayes before in fiery guise He gave Mount Zions Law from graces store. The Gospell Law of Spirit and Life out highs In fiery Tongues that did confound all those At Pentecost that Zions King oppose. The Harvest of the year through Grace now inn'd, Enjoyd and Consecrated with Right praise, All typefying that the right we sind Away's restor'd by Christ: and all things raisd Fit for our use, and that we thankfully Unto the use thereof ourselves should ply. Lord make me to the Pentecost repare, Make me thy Guest too at this Feast, and live Up to thy Gospell Law: and let my fare Be of the two white Loaves this feast doth give. If Prophets Seeding yield me harvest, I Will as I reap sing thee my harvest joy. 23. Meditation. 1 Joh. 2.2. He is the Propitiation for our Sins. 17.7m [Sept.] 1697. Greate Lord, yea Greatest Lord of Lords thou art, And King of Kings, may my poor Creaking Pipe Salute thine Eare; This thought doth sink my heart Ore burdened with over sweet Delight. An Ant bears more proportion to the World Than doth my piping to thine eare thus hurld. It is a Sight amazing strange to see An Emperour picking an Emmets Egge. More strange it's that Almighty should to mee E're lend his Eare. And yet this thing I beg. I'm small and Naught, thou mayst much less me spare Than I the Nit that hangeth on my hair. But oh thy Grace! What glory on it hings, In that thou makest thy Son to bare away The marrow of the matter choice that Clings Unto the Service of Atonment's day? This was his Type, He is its Treasure rich That Reconciles for Sin that doth us ditch. Sins thick and threefold at my threshold lay At Graces threshold I all gore in Sin. Christ backt the Curtain, Grace made bright the day, As he did our Atonement full step in. So Glorious he. His Type is all unmeet To typify him till aton'd and sweet. A'ron as he atonement made did ware His milke white linen Robes, to typify Christ cloath'd in human flesh pure White, all fair, And undefild, atoneing God most High. Two Goates he took, and lots to know Gods will, Which he should send away: and Which, should kill. Dear Christ, thy Natures two are typ't thereby Making one Sacrifice, Humane, Divine. The Manhood is Gods Lot, and this must dy. The Godhead as the Scape Goate death declines. One Goat atones, one beares all Sin away. Thy natures do this work, each as they lay. Aaron the blood must catch in's Vessell to hold. Lord let my Soule the Vessell be of thine. Aaron must in a Censar all of Gold Sweet incense burn with Altars fire Divine To Typify the Incense of thy Prayer Perfuming of thy Service thou didst beare. Aaron goes in unto the Holy place With blood of Sprinkling and sprinkles there Atones the Tabernacle, Altars face And Congregation, for defild all were. Christ with his proper blood did enter in The Heavens bright, propitiates for Sin. Aaron then burns the Goat without the Camp And Bullock too whose blood went in the Vaile. Christ sufferd so without the Gate Deaths Cramp, And Cramped Hell thereby. The Divells quaile. Thus done with God Aaron aside did lay His Linen Robes, and put on's Golden Ray. And in this Rich attire he doth apply Himselfe before the peoples very eyes, Unto the other Service, richly high To typify the gracious properties Wherewith Christs human nature was bedight In which he mediates within Gods Sight. What wonder's here? Shall such a sorry thing As I have such rich Cost laid down for mee Whose best at best as mine's not worth a Wing Of one poore Fly, that I should have from thee Such Influences of thy goodness smite mee And make me mute as by delight envite mee? Lord let thy Gracious hand me chafe, and rub Till my numbd joynts be quickn'd and compleat, With Heate and Spirits all divine, and good, To make them nimble in thy Service Greate. Oh! take my ALL thyselfe, all though I bee All bad, I have no better gift for thee. Although my gift is but a Wooden toole If thou receive it, thou wilt it enrich With Grace, thats better than Apollo's Stoole. Thy Oracles 'twill utter out the which Will make my Spirits thy bright golden Wyers, altaschat Michtam tune in Angells Quires. 24. Meditation Joh. 1.14. ????????[?] ?? ???? Tabernacled amongst us. 25.10m [Dec.] 1697. My Soul would gazing all amazed stand, To see the burning Sun, with'ts golden locks (An hundred sixty six times more than th'land) Ly buttond up in a Tobacco box. But this bright Wonder, Lord, that fore us playes May make bright Angells gasterd, at it gaze. That thou, my Lord, that hast the Heavens bright Pav'd with the Sun, and Moon, with Stars o're pinckt, Thy Tabernacle, yet shouldst take delight To make my flesh thy Tent, and tent with in't. Wonders themselves do seem to faint away To finde the Heavens Filler housd in Clay. Thy Godhead Cabbin'd in a Myrtle bowre, A Palm branch tent, an Olive Tabernacle, A Pine bough Booth, An Osier House or tower A mortall bitt of Manhood, where the Staple Doth fixt, uniting of thy natures, hold, And hold out marvels more than can be told. Thy Tabernacles floore Celestiall Doth Canopie the Whole World. Lord; and wilt Thou tabernacle in a tent so small? Have Tent, and Tent cloath of a Humane Quilt? Thy Person make a bit of flesh of mee Thy Tabernacle, and its Canopee? Wonders! my Lord, Thy Nature all With Mine Doth by the Feast of Booths Conjoynd appeare Together in thy Person all Divine Stand House, and House holder. What Wonder's here? Thy Person infinite, without compare Cloaths made of a Carnation leafe doth ware. What Glory to my nature doth thy Grace Confer, that it is made a Booth for thine To tabernacle in? Wonders take place. Thou low dost step aloft to lift up mine. Septembers fifteenth day did type the Birth Of this thy tabernacle here on earth. And through this leafy Tent the glory cleare Of thy Rich Godhead shineth very much: The Crowds of Sacrifices which swarm here Shew forth thy Efficacy now is such Flowing in from thy natures thus united As Clears off Sin, and Victims all benighted. But yet the Wonder grows: and groweth much, For thou wilt Tabernacles change with mee. Not onely Nature, but my person tuch. Thou wilst mee thy, and thee, my tent to bee. Thou wilt, if I my heart will to thee rent, My Tabernacle make thy Tenement. Thou'lt tent in mee, I dwell in thee shall here. For housing thou wilt pay mee rent in bliss: And I shall pay thee rent of Reverent fear For Quarters in thy house. Rent mutuall is. Thy Tenent and thy Teniment I bee. Thou Landlord art and Tenent too to mee. Lord lease thyselfe to mee out: make mee give A Leafe unto thy Lordship of myselfe. Thy Tenent, and thy Teniment I'le live. And give and take Rent of Celestiall Wealth. I'le be thy Tabernacle: thou shalt bee My Tabernacle. Lord thus mutuall wee. The Feast of Tabernacles makes me sing Out thy Theanthropy, my Lord, I'le spare No Musick here. Sweet Songs of praises in The Tabernacles of the Righteous are. My Palmifer'd Hosannah Songs I'le raise On my Shoshannims blossoming thy praise. 25. Meditation Numb. 28.4.9. One Lamb shalt thou offer in the Morning, and the other at Even. And on the Sabbath day two Lambs etc. 6.1m [Mar.] 1698. Guilty, my Lord, What can I more declare? Thou knowst the Case, and Cases of my Soule. A Box of tinder: Sparks that falling o're Set all on fire, and worke me all in Shoals. A Pouch of Passion is my Pericarde. Sparks fly when ere my Flint and Steele strike hard. I am a Dish of Dumps: yea ponderous dross, Black blood all clotted, burdening my heart, That Anger's anvill, and my bark bears moss. My Spirits soakt are drunke with blackish Art. If any Vertue stir, it is but feeble. Th'Earth Magnet is, my heart's the trembling needle. My Mannah breedeth Worms: Thoughts fly blow'd are. My heart's the Temple of the God of Flies. My Tongue's an Altar of forbidden Weare Fansy a foolish fire enflam'd by toys Perfum'de with reeching Offerings of Sins Whose steaming reechs delight hobgoblings. My Lord, is there no help for this with thee? Must I abuse, and be abused thus? There Morn, and Even Sacrifices bee: To cleans the Sins of Day, and Night from us. Christ is the Lamb: my Pray're each morn and night As Incense offer I up in thy Sight. My morn, and evening Sacrifice I bring With Incense sweet upon mine Altar Christ, With Oyle and Wine two quarters of an Hin With flower for a Meat Offering all well spic'dt, On bended knees, with hands that tempt the Skies. This is each day's atoning Sacrifice. And thou the Sabbath settledst at the first And wilt continue it till last. Wherefore, Who strike down Gospell Sabbaths are accurst. Two Lambs, a Meat, and Drinke offering God more Conferd on it than any other Day As types the Gospell Sabbaths to display. Here is Atonement made: and Spirituall Wine Pourd out to God: and Sanctified Bread From Heaven's givn us: What! shall we decline With God Communion, thus to be fed? This Heavenly fare will make true Grace to thrive. Such as deny this thing are not alive. I'le tend thy Sabbaths: at thine Altar feed. And never make thy type a nullitie. The Ceremonies cease, but yet the Creede Contained therein, continues gospelly, That make my feeble Spirits will grow frim. Hence I in Sabbath Service love to swim. My Vespers, and my Mattins Ile attend: My Sabbath Service carry on I will. Atoning Efficacy God doth send To Sinners in this path, and grace here stills. Still this on me untill I glory Gain. And then Ile sing thy praise in better Strain. 26. Meditation Heb. 9.13.14. How much more shall the blood of Christ, etc. 26.4m [June] 1698. Unclean, Unclean: My Lord, Undone, all vile Yea all Defild: What shall thy Servant doe? Unfit for thee: not fit for holy Soile, Nor for Communion of Saints below. A bag of botches, Lump of Loathsomeness: Defild by Touch, by Issue: Leproust flesh. Thou wilt have all that enter do thy fold Pure, Cleane, and bright, Whiter than whitest Snow Better refin'd than most refined Gold: I am not so: but fowle: What shall I doe? Shall thy Church Doors be shut, and shut out mee? Shall not Church fellowship my portion bee? How can it be? Thy Churches do require Pure Holiness: I am all filth, alas! Shall I defile them, tumbled thus in mire? Or they mee cleanse before I current pass? If thus they do, Where is the Niter bright And Sope they offer mee to wash me White? The Brisk Red heifer's Ashes, when calcin'd, Mixt all in running Water, is too Weake To wash away my Filth: The Dooves assign'd Burnt, and Sin Offerings neer do the feate But as they Emblemize the Fountain Spring Thy Blood, my Lord, set ope to wash off Sin. Oh! richest Grace! Are thy Rich Veans then tapt To ope this Holy Fountain (boundless Sea) For Sinners here to lavor off (all sapt With Sin) their Sins and Sinfulness away? In this bright Chrystall Crimson Fountain flows What washeth whiter, than the Swan or Rose. Oh! wash mee, Lord, in this Choice Fountain, White That I may enter, and not sully here Thy Church, whose floore is pav'de with Graces bright And hold Church fellowship with Saints most cleare. My Voice all sweet, with their melodious layes Shall make sweet Musick blossom'd with thy praise. 27. Meditation Upon Heb. 9.13.14. How much more shall the Blood of Christ etc. 4.7m [Sept.] 1698. My mentall Eye, spying thy sparkling Fold Bedeckt, my Lord, with Glories shine alone, That doth out do all Broideries of Gold: And Pavements of Rich Pearles, and Precious Stone Did double back its Beams to light my Sphere Making an inward Search, for what springs there. And in my Search I finde myselfe defild: Issues and Leprosies all ore mee streame. Such have not Enterance. I am beguild: My Seate, Bed, Saddle, Spittle too's uncleane. My Issue Running Leprosy doth spread: My upper Lip is Covered: not my Head. Hence all ore ugly, Nature Poysond stands, Lungs all Corrupted, Skin all botch't and scabd A Feeble Voice, a Stinking Breath out fand And with a Scurfy Skale I'me all ore clagd. Robes rent: Head bare, Lips Coverd too, I cry, Unclean, Unclean, and from thy Camp do fly. Woe's mee. Undone! Undone! my Leprosy! Without a Miracle there is no Cure. Worse than the Elephantick Mange I spie My Sickness is. And must I it endure? Dy of my Leprosy? Lord, say to't nay, I'le Cure thee in my wonder working way. I see thy Gracious hand indeed hath caught Two Curious pritty pure Birds, types most sure Of thy two Natures, and The one is brought To shed its blood in running waters pure Held in an Earthen Panchin which displays Thy Blood and Water preacht in Gospell dayes. The slain Dove's buri'de: In whose Blood (in water) The Living Turtle, Ceder, Scarlet twine, And Hysop dipted are (as an allator) Sprinkling the Leper with it Seven times That typify Christs Blood by Grace applide To Sinners vile, and then they're purifide. Sprindge Lord mee With it. Wash me also in The Poole of Shiloam, and shave mee bare With Gospells Razer. Though the Roots of Sin Bud up again, again shave off its hair. Thy Eighth dayes Bath, and Razer make more gay, Than th'Virgin Maries Purifying day. My Tresspass, Sin, and my Burnt Sacrifices My Flowre and Oyle, for my meate Offering My Lord, thou art. Whether Lambs or Doves up rise And with thy Holy Blood atonement bring, And put thy Blood upon my Right Eare fair Whose tip shall it, its Onely jewell, Ware. And put it Gold-Ring-like on my Right Thumbe And on my Right Greate toe as a Rich Gem. Thy Blood will not Head, Hand nor Foot benum, But satisfy and cleans all fault from them. Then put thy Holy Oyle upon the place Of th'Blood of my Right Eare, Thumb, Toe. Here's Grace. Then Holiness shall Consecrate mine Eare. And sanctify my Fingers Ends, and Toes. And in my hearing, Working, Walking here The Breath of Sanctifying Grace out goes. Perfuming all these Actions, and my life. Oh! Sweetest Sweet. Hence Holiness is rife. Lord, Cleanse mee thus with thy Rich Bloods Sweet Shower My Issue stop: destroy my Leprosy. Thy Holy Oyle upon my Head out poure And cloathe my heart and Life with Sanctity. My Head, my Hand and Foot shall strike thy praise, If thus besprinkled, and Encamp thy Wayes. 28. Meditation Isai. 32.2. A man shall be for a hiding place from the Winde. 11.10m [Dec.] 1698. That Bowre, my Lord, which thou at first didst build Was pollished most gay, and every ranck Of Creatures in't shone bright, each of them filld With dimpling Glory, Cield with golden planck Of smiling Beauty. Man then bore the Bell: Shone like a Carbuncle in Glories Shell! How brave, and bright was I then, Lord, myselfe? But woe is mee! I have transgresst thy Law, Undone, defild, Disgrac'd, destroy'd my Wealth, Persu'de by flaming Vengeance, as fire dry straw. All Ranks I broake, their Glory I benighted Their Beauty blasted, and their Bliss befrighted. Hence Black-Blew, Purple Spots of Horrid guilt, Rise in my Soule. Mee Vengeance hath in Chase To spill my blood, 'cause I her Glory spilt, And did the Creatures Glory all disgrace. Shall I fall by the Venger's hand, before I get within the Refuge Citie's doore? Oh! give me Angells Wings to fly to thee, My Lord, all stumbling stones pick out of th'way. Thou art my Refuge City, and shalt bee. Receive me in, let not th'Avenger slay. I do attempt to over run my Sin: And fly to thee, my Refuge. Let mee in. Ive by my Sin a man, the Son of man Slain, and myselfe, Selfe Murderer, I slew. Yet on the Golden Wings of Faith which fan The Gospell Aire the Altars Horns I wooe, Renouncing all my Sins, and Vanity And am resolv'd before the same to dy. Accept me, Lord, and give my Sailes thine Aire, That I may swiftly sayle unto thyselfe. Be thou my Refuge and thy Blood my faire. Disgrace my Guilt, and grace me with thy Wealth. Be thou my Refuge City, take mee in. And I thy Praise will on Muth Labben sing. 29. Meditation 1 Pet. 3.20. While the Ark was Building. 5.12m [Feb.] 1698. What shall I say, my Lord? with what begin? Immence Profaneness Wormholes ery part. The World is saddlebackt with Loads of Sin. Sin Craks the Axle tree of this greate Cart. Floodgates of Firy Vengeance open fly And Smoakie Clouds of Wrath darken the Skie. The Fountains of the Deep up broken are. The Cataracts of heaven do boile ore With Wallowing Seas. Thunder, and Lightenings tare Spouts out of Heaven, Floods out from hell do roare. To overflow, and drownd the World all drownd And overflown with Sin, that doth abound. Oh! for an Ark: an Ark of Gopher Wood. This Flood's too stately to be rode upon By others boats, which are base swilling tubs. It gulps them up as gudgeons. And they're gone. But thou, my Lord, dost Antitype this Arke, And rod'st upon these Waves that toss and barke. Thy Humane Nature, (oh Choice Timber Rich) Bituminated ore within, and out With Dressing of the Holy Spirits pitch Propitiatory Grace parg'd round about. This Ark will ride upon the Flood, and live Nor passage to a drop through Chink holes give. This Ark will swim upon the fiery flood: All Showrs of fire the heavens rain on't will Slide off: though Hells and Heavens Spouts out stood And meet upon't to crush't to Shivers, still It neither sinks, breaks, Fires, nor Leaky prooves, But lives upon them all and upward mooves. All that would not be drownded must be in't Be Arkd in Christ, or else the Cursed rout Of Crimson Sins their Cargoe will them sinke And suffocate in Hell, because without. Then Ark me, Lord, thus in thyselfe that I May dance upon these drownding Waves with joye. Sweet Ark, with Concord sweetend, in thee feed The Calfe, and Bare, Lamb, Lion at one Crib. Here Rattlesnake and Squerrell jar not, breed. The Hawk and Dove, the Leopard, and the Kid Do live in Peace, the Child, and Cockatrice. As if Red Sin tantarrow'd in no vice. Take me, my Lord, into thy golden Ark. Then when thy flood of fire shall come, I shall Though Hell spews streams of Flames, and th'Heavens spark Out Storms of burning Coals, swim safe ore all. I'le make thy Curled flames my Citterns Wire To toss my Songs of Praise rung on them, higher. 30. Meditation Math. 12.40. As Jonah was three Dayes, and three nights in the Whales belly. So must etc. 9.2m [Apr.] 1699. Prest down with sorrow, Lord, not for my Sin But with Saint 'Tony Cross I crossed groane. Thus my leane Muses garden thwarts the spring Instead of Anthems, breatheth her ahone. But duty raps upon her doore for Verse. That makes her bleed a poem through her searce. When, Lord, man was the miror of thy Works In happy state, adorn'd with Glory's Wealth What heedless thing was hee? The serpent lurks Under an apple paring, and by stealth Destroy'd her Glory. O poor keeper hee Was of himselfe: lost God, and lost his Glee. Christ, as a Turtle Dove, puts out his Wing. Lay all on me, I will, saith hee, Convay Away thy fault, and answer for thy sin. Thou'st be the Stowhouse of my Grace, and lay It and thyselfe out in my service pure And I will for thy sake the storm Endure. Jonas did type this thing, who ran away From God and shipt for Tarsus, fell asleep. A storm lies on the Ship. The Seamen they Bestir their stumps, and at wits end do weep. Wake, Jonas, who saith Heave me over deck. The Storm will Cease then, all lies on my neck. They cast him overboard out of the ship. The tempest terrible, lies thereby still. A Mighty Whale nam'd Neptunes Dog doth skip At such a Boon, Whose greedy gorge can't kill Neither Concoct this gudgeon, but its Chest Became the Prophets Coffin for the best. He three dayes here lies trancifi'de and prayes. Prooves working Physick in the Fishes Crop. Maybe in th'Euxine, or the Issick Bay She puking falls and he alive out drops. She vomits him alive out on the Land Whence he to Ninive receives command. A sermon he unto the Gentiles preacht, Yet fortie dayes, and Ninus is destroy'd. Space granted, this Repentance doth them teach God pardons them, and thus they ruine 'void. Oh! Sweet Sweet Providence, rich Grace hath spic'te This Overture to be a type of Christ. Jonas our Turtle Dove, I Christ intend Is in the ship for Tarsus under saile. A fiery storm tempestiously doth spend The Vessill, and its hands. All Spirits faile. The ship will sink or Wrack upon the rocks Unless the tempest cease the same to box. None can it Charm but Jonas. Christ up posts Is heaved overboard into the sea. The Dove must die. The storm gives up its Ghost And Neptune's Dogg leapes at him as a Prey. Whose stomach is his Grave where he doth sleep, Three Dayes sepulchred, Jonas in the Deep. The Grave him swallow'd down as a rich Pill Of Working Physick full of Virtue which Doth purge Death's Constitution of its ill. And womble-Crops her stomach where it sticks. It heaves her stomach till her hasps off fly. And out hee comes Cast up, rais'd up thereby. In glorious Grace he to the Heathen goes Envites them to Repentance, they accept. Oh! Happy Message squandering Curst foes. Grace in her glorious Charriot here rides deckt. Wrath's Fire is quencht. And Graces sun out shines. Death on her deathbed lies, Consumes and pines. Here is my rich Atonement in thy Death, My Lord, nought is so sweet, though sweat it cost. This turns from me Gods wrath: Thy sweet sweet breath Revives my heart: thy Rising up o're bosst My Soule with Hope seeing acquittance in't. That all my sins are kill'd, that did mee sinke. I thanke thee, Lord. Thy death hath deadned quite The Dreadfull Tempest. Let thy Dovy wings Oreshadow me, and all my Faults benight And with Celestiall Dews my soule besprindge. In Angells Quires I'le then my Michtams sing, Upon my Jonath Elem Rechokim. 31. Meditation Joh. 15.13. Greater Love hath no man etc. 4.4m [June] 1699. Its said H doth enjoy A Tree of Gold whose Root is deemd t'have birth At Centre of the Earth whose Spirits fly Ore all its body blossoming on the earth. Leaves dance and Fruits grow on its twigs and limbs. That make a golden Smile on Spanish Kings. Yet this rich vegitable tree of Gold Is but a Toade Stoole bowre compar'd to thee My blessed Lord, whose tent of Humane mould Shines like Gods Paradise, Where springs the tree Of Pure, Pure Love that doth thy friends enfold In richer Robes than all those Leaves of gold. Thy Love-Affection, rooted in the Soyle, Of Humane Nature, springing up all ore With Sanctifying Grace, of brightest file Brings Loads of Love to sinfull man all gore. Here is greate Love, greaten'd by influences To which thy Godhead to the same dispenses. No Spirits ever yet were founde within The golden Tree of Humane nature, bud, Or blossom such a Love, or Lovely thing As this thy nature doth so greate so good. The Plant's set in a Soile Pure, faultless, stronge, Its fruite sores to the highst pitch, Good, Greate, and Longe. There is no Sin can touch this Lovely Love. Its Holy, with a perfect Holiness. Its grown unto the highst Degree, above All Stuntedness, or stately Stintedness. The Soile is faultless, and doth give its Strength. The Plant doth beare its fruite of largest length. This Love in thee most pure, and perfect stands A Relative, and hath its object here Which it befriends with all good things, and hands In holy wayes to heavenly Glory cleare. Oh! happy such as with it are befriended: With perfect Love, to perfect bliss they're tended. Make me thy Friend: Befriend me with thy Love. Here's cloaths more rich than Silk or Cloth of gold. I'le in the Circuite of thy Friendship moove So thy Warm Love enspire mine Organs would. My Garden will give sweet, and Lovely Flowers If thou distill thereon thy Love in Showres. Lord, let thy Sunshine-Love my Dial grace. Then what a Clock it is, it will display. The glory of the Sunshine on it's Face Will take the light and tell the time of Day. My Hammer then shall greet this Shine as well With praise tun'de on my bell. 32. Meditation Joh. 15.13. Greater Love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his Life for his friends. 30.5m [July] 1699. Oh! that I could, my Lord, but chide away That Dulness and the Influences which Thy All wise Providence doth brieze, display, Unedging of my Spirits, them down pitch, Although thy quick'ning Love might make them spring With its Warm Sun Shine till like birds they sing. That Love of in thy Person dwells All Wonderful in Birth, in Natures shine In Union too, o're leaping Reason's Shells One made of twoness Humane, and Divine Of Infinite, and Finite, (take my Word) Compound, and Uncompound compose a Third. That Love I see that in thy Person dwells, So Great and Good, nothing too good appeares For it to give to such on whom it fell. Although it shine on mee I hang mine Eares, Although it smiles thy doth scowle In some Things whence my seems fowle. Love One Object Thy Life (that Wond'rous Life) is One Thy people the other though they snug In Satans Arms, in Sin and Wrath ore grown This Object then much Unless thy Love from Love borrows Wisdome's Eyes and with them lookes O're Nature's Cabbinet of Jewells bright And then attemps th'Accounts down in Gods Books If Credit may be made and they made right. But here she findes the Sums so greate, the Debt Exceed the Worth in Nature's Cabinet. Alass! what now? shall Satans wiles out wit Wisdom itselfe and take away Christs eye His portion from him, and off tare and split The Object of his Love and Oh! Cursed Elf the fool dost thy beams of Wisdome's toole. How doth she now, my Lord, spy out the Way Her object and thy merit to set free? She Comes to thee, and makes thy person pay Seing sufficient worth alone in thee. Hence to the Debtor goes to end the strife Ore payes their debts in laying down her Life. The Better object of thy Love, Christs Love, Surrenders up to ruin to redeem The Other Object of it and remove That Wrath that else would ever on it been, Which done it did resume the Life down laid And both its Objects from the Curse free made. O let thy lovely streams of Love distill Upon myselfe and spoute their spirits pure Into my Viall, and my Vessell fill With liveliness, from dulness me secure. And I will answer all this Love of thine When with it thou hast made me all Divine. What wilt thou, Lord, deny mee this, that would Not once deny to lay thy Choice Life downe? To make a Cabbinet of't more worth than gold, To give to thine, and buy them Glories Crowne, My Heart shall harbor better than If thou my dross dost but refine from mee. Lord! make my Leaden Whistle metall good, That in thy Service it may split an haire. If thou wilt whet it on thy Holy Rub Twill trim my Life of sin, and make mee fair. And I will sing a song of Love to thee In a Seraphick tune and full of glee. 33. Meditation Joh. 15.13. Greater Love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his Life for his Friend. 1.8m [Oct.] 1699. Walking, my Lord, within thy Paradise I finde a Fruite whose Beauty smites mine Eye And Taste my Tooth that had no Core nor Vice. An Hony Sweet, that's never rotting, ly Under a Tree, which view'd, I knew to bee The Tree of Life whose Bulk's Theanthropie. And looking up, I saw its boughs all bow With Clusters of this Fruit that it doth bring, Nam'de Greatest LOVE. And well, For bulk, and brow, Thereof, of th'sap of Godhood-Manhood spring. What Love is here for kinde? What sort? How much? None ever, but the Tree of Life, bore such. Who is the Object of this Love? and in Whose mouth doth fall the Apple of this tree? Is't Man? A Sinner? Such a Wormhol'de thing? Oh! matchless Love, Laid out on such as Hee! Should Gold Wed Dung, should Stars Wooe Lobster Claws, It would no wonder, like this Wonder, cause. Is sinfull Man the Object of this Love? What then doth it for this its Object doe, That doth require a purging far above The whiteness, Sope and Nitre can bestow, (Else Justice will its Object take away Out of its bosome, and to hell't convay?) Hence in it steps, to justice saith, I'll make Thee satisfaction, and my Object shine. I'l slay my Humane Nature for thy sake Fild with the Worthiness of thy Divine Make pay therewith. The Fruite doth sacrifice The tree that bore't. This for its object dies. An Higher round upon this golden scale Love cannot Climbe, than to lay down the Life Of him that loves, for him belov'd to bale, Thereby to satisfy, and end all strife. Thou lay'st, my Lord, thy Life down for thy Friend And greater Love than this none can out send. Then make me, Lord, thy Friend, I humbly pray Though I thereby should be deare bought by thee. Not dearer yet than others, for the pay Is but the same for others as for mee. If I be in thy booke, my Life shall proove My Love to thee, an Offering to thy Love. 34. Meditation. Rev. 1.5. Who loved us and washed away our Sins in his Blood. 26.9m [Nov.] 1699. Suppose this Earthy globe a Cocoe Nut Whose Shell most bright, and hard out challenge should The richest Carbunckle in gold ring put How rich would proove the kirnell it should hold? But be it so, who then could breake this Shell, To pick the kirnell, walld within this Cell? Should I, my Lord, call thee this nut, I should Debase thy Worth, and of thee basely stut. Thou dost its worth as far excell as would Make it to thine worse than a worm eat nut. Were all the World a sparkling pearle, 't would bee Worse than a dot of Dung if weighd with thee. What Elemented bit was that, thine eyes Before the Elements were moulded, ey'd? And it Encabbineting Jewell wise Up in thy person, be'st nigh Deified? It lay as pearle in dust in this wide world, But thou it tookst, and in thy person firld. To finde a Pearle in Oister Shells's not strange: For in such rugged bulwarks such abound. But this Rich Gem in Humane Natures grange So bright could by none Eye but thine be found. Its mankind flowr'd, searst, kneaded up in Love To Manna in Gods moulding trough above. This bit of Humane Flesh Divinizd in The Person of the Son of God; the Cell Of Soule, and Blood, where Love Divine doth swim Through veans, through Arteries, Heart flesh, and fell, Doth with its Circkling Arms about entwinde A Portion of its kindred choice, Mankinde. But these defild by Sin, Justice doth stave Off from the bliss Love them prepar'de, untill She's satisfide, and sentence too she gave That thou should feel her vengeance and her will. Hence Love steps in, turns by the Conduit Cock: Her Veans full payment on the Counter drop. Now Justice satisfi'de, Loves Milke white hand Them takes and brings unto her Ewer of blood Doth make Free Grace her golden Wisp, and Sand With which she doth therein them Wash scoure, rub And Wrince them cleane untill their Beauty shows More pure, and white, than Lilly, Swan, or Rose. What love, my Lord, dost thou lay out on thine When to the Court of Justice cald they're judg'd. Thou with thy Blood and Life dost pay their fine Thy Life, for theirs, thy Blood for theirs must budge. Their Sin, Guilt, Curse upon thyselfe dost lay: Thy Grace, thy Justice, Life on them Convay. Make such a Change, my Lord, with mee, I pray. I'le give thee then, my Heart, and Life to th'bargen. Thy golden Scepter then my Soule shall sway Along my Path unto thy Palace garden. Wash off my filth, with thy rich blood, and I Will stud thy praise with thankfull melody. 35. Meditation Joh. 15.5. Without me yee can do nothing. 3.1m [Mar.] 1699/1700. My Blessed Lord, that Golden Linck that joyns My Soule, and thee, out blossoms on't this Spruice Peart Pronown my more spiritous than wines, Rooted in Rich Relation, Graces Sluce. This little Voice feasts mee with fatter Sweets Than all the Stars that pave the Heavens Streets. It hands me All, my heart, and hand to thee And up doth lodge them in thy persons Lodge And as a Golden bridg ore it to mee Thee, and thine All to me, and never dodge. In this small Ship a mutuall Intrest sayles From Heaven and Earth, by th'holy Spirits gales. Thy Ware to me's so rich, should my Returns Be packt in sparkling Metaphors, out stilld From Zion's garden flowers, by fire that burns Aright, of Saphire Battlements up filld And sent in Jasper Vialls it would bee A pack of guilded Non-Sense unto thee. Such Golden Palace Walled round With Walls made of transparent Silver bright With Towers of Diamonds and in't is found A Throne of Sparkling Carbuncle like light Wherein sits Crownd one with the Sunn. The same Would be but Smoak compar'd to thy bright flame. Thy Humane frame's a Curious Palace, raisd Of th'Creame of Natures top Perfection here Where Grace sits Sovereign that ere ore blazd The splendent beams of precious Stones most clear. Whose Mace, and Scepter richer Matter shine, Than Berill, Amathyst or Smaregdine. Here is a Living Spring of power which tapt All-doing influences hence do flow. What we have done undone us hath, (sad hapt) That we without thee now can nothing do. We cannot do what do we should, (in Summ) Nor undo what undoes us, by us done. We have our Souls undone, Can't undo this. We have Undone the Law, this can't undo: We have undone the World, when did amiss, We can't undoe the Curse that brings in Woe. Our Undo-Doing can't undo, its true. Wee can't our Souls, and things undone, renew. Without thee wee can nothing do, its sure. Thou saidst the same. We finde thy Saying true. Thou canst do all things: all amiss canst cure, Undo our Undo-doing, make all new. Thou madst this World: dost it thy play-house keep Wherein the Stars themselves play Hide-and-Seek. It is thy Green, where all thy Creatures play At Barly-Breake and often lose their fleece. But we poore wee our Soules a wager lay At Nine-Mens Morrice, and at Fox and Geese. Let me not play myselfe away, nor Grace. Nor lose my Soule, My Lord, at prison base. Reclaim thy Claim: finde me refinde; I'm thine. Without thee I can nothing do, Dispense, Thyselfe to me, and all things thine are mine, I'le not account of what thou countst offence. Give me thy Power to work, and thou shalt finde Thy Work attended with my hand, and minde. 36. [Meditation.] Col. 1.18. He is the Head of the Body. 19.3m [May] 1700. An Head, my Lord, an honourable piece; Nature's high tower, and wealthy Jewelry; A box of Brains, furld up in reasons fleece: Casement of Senses: Reason's Chancery: Religions Chancell pia-mater'd ore With Damask Roses that Sweet wisdom bore. This is, my Lord, the rosie Emblem sweet, Blazing thyselfe out, on my mudd wall, fair, And in thy Palace, where the rosy feet Of thy Deare Spouse doth thee her head thus ware. Her Head thou art: Head glory of her Knot. Thou art her Flower, and she thy flower pot. The Metall Kingdoms had a Golden head, Yet had't no brains, or had its brains out dasht. But Zions Kingdome fram'd hath better sped, Through which the Rayes of thy rich head are lasht. She wares thee Head, thou art her strong defence Head of Priority, and Excellence. Hence art an head of Arguments so strong To argue all unto thyselfe, when bent And quickly tongue ty, or pluck out the tongue Of all Contrary pleas or arguments. It makes them weake as water, for the tide Of Truth and Excellence rise on this Side. Lord, let these barbed Arrows from thy bow Fly through mine Eyes, and Eares to strike my heart. And force my Will, and Reason to thee so And stifle pleas made for the other part That so my Soule, rid of their Sophistry In rapid flames of Love to thee may fly. My Metaphors are but dull Tacklings tag'd With ragged Non-Sense. Can such draw to thee My stund affections all with Cinders clag'd, If thy bright beaming headship touch not mee? If that thy headship shines not in mine eyes, My heart will fuddled ly with wordly toyes. Lord play thy Excellency on this pin To tongue ty other pleas my gadding heart Is tooke withall. Chime my affections in To serve thy Sacred selfe with Sacred art. Oh! let thy Head stretch ore my heart its wing And then my Heart thy Headships praise shall sing. 37. Meditation. Col. 1.18. He is the Head, etc. 14.5m [July] 1700. It grieves mee, Lord, to thinke thy famous Name Should not be guilded ore with my bright Love. Yet griev'd I am to thinke thy splendid fame Should be bedotcht by such poore Stuff I moove, That thy Bright Pearle, impald in gold, My Theme, Should by my addle brains, finde a dull veane. Thou art an Head, the richest, that e're wore A Crown of Glory, where the Kirnell lies Of deepest Wisdom, boxt in Brains, that sore In highest Notions, of the richest Sise Compar'd whereto man's Wisdom up doth rise Like Childrens catching speckled Butterflies. Thou art the Head of Causes to thy Church: Its Cause of Reconciliation art, Thou it Redeemdst, and hast gi'n hell the lurch. Thou Sanctifiest it in Life, and Heart. Thou dost it Form, Inform, Reform, and Try Conform to thee, marre her Deformity. A Glorious Heade of Choicest influence More rich than Rubies, golden rivlets lie Convaying Grace along these channells thence To heart, hand, foot, head, tongue, to eare, and eye. That man, as th'golden Tree, golde blossoms shoots. And glorifieth God with golden fruites. A Royall Head of Majesty to make Heade of thy foes thy footstoole Stepping Stone. Thou giv'st forth Holy Laws, and up dost take The Ruling Scepter over every one. The Golden Rule is ever in thy hand By which thine walk unto the golden Strand. Be thou my Head: and of thy Body make mee Thy Influences in my Cue distill. Guild thou my Chamber with thy Grace, and take mee Under thy Rule, and rule mee by thy Will. Be thou my head, and act my tongue whereby Its tittle-tattle may thee glorify. 38. Meditation. Col. 1.18. He is the Head of the Body, the Church, who is the Beginning. 22.7m [Sept.] 1700. If that my Power was answerable to My minde, my Lord, my little mite would rise With something in its hand of Worth to 'stow And send to thee through the bright azure Skies. For next unto Infinity, I finde Its Love unto thyselfe of boundless kinde. Its Love, Desire, Esteem of thee all scorn Confining limits, whose Dimensions stand Immeasurable, but my Power's down born, Its impotency; Cannot heave a Sand Over a Straw, that all the fruites my Will Can e're produce can't or one Sin kill. This Wracks my heart, and low my person layes And rowles mee in the dust at thoughts hereon. That thou, who dost deserve all glorious praise Should with an Empty Will, whose power is none Be paid, indeed; But yet, (O pardon mee) I want a power, not will to honour thee. Thou Wisdom art, Wisdom's the heads Chiefe thing, Thou the Beginning art of Gods Creation. And therefore art of Excellence the Spring And the Beginning of all Holy Station. First born from th'Dead: Sun like thy Excellence All Good things doth like Sunbeames forth dispense. All Love, and Praise, all Service, Honour bright From all the Sons of men is but thy due. Thou their beginning art: they and their might Should sing thy glory out and it forth show. But, oh my Shame, I have no Power nor Skill To do the Same, onely an Empty Will. But, O my Lord, thou the Beginning art, Begin to draw afresh thine Image out In Shining Colours, on my Life, and Heart Begin anew thy foes in mee to route. Begin again to breize upon my Soule Breize after brieze untill I touch the goale. Thou the Beginning art of Order, and Art Head of Principalities and Power Archont of Kings, Archangell to the Band Of Angells, and Archangells in their flower. Thou art, Lord, Principall: whose Beings run And all best things, like Sun beames from the Sun. Be ever, Lord beginning till I end, At carrying on thine Intrest in my Soule. For thy beginning will my marrd minde mende And make it pray Lord, take mee for thy tole. If mee as Wheate thy Tole-Dish doth once greet My tune's to thee Al-tashcheth Mictam Sweet. 39. Meditation. Col. 1.18. The First Born from the Dead. 10m [Dec.] 1700. Poor wither'd Crickling, My lord, am I Whose shrunke up Skin hidebounds my kirnell so That Love its Vitall Sparke's so squeezd thereby 'T must breake the prisons Walls ere it can go Unto thyselfe. Hence let thy warm beams just Make it to grow that it may breake its husk. Love like to hunger'll breake through stone strong Walls. Nay brazen Walls cannot imprison it Up from its object, when its object calls In Beams attractive falling on it thick. My Chilly Love sick of the Ague lies. Lord touch it with thy Sun shine, make it rise. Death shall not deaden it, while thy Sun shines. The keyes of Hell, and Death are at thy Side. Thy Conquoring Powre draws ore the grave thy lines, Whose darksom Dungeon thy dead body tri'de. Thou hast Death's Shady Region Conquoured Rose, as the Sun, up First born from the Dead. First Fruits of them that sleep to sanctify The Harvest all, thou art. Thou art therefore The First born from the Dead in Dignity In kinde, Cause, Order, to dy, and rise no more, As those raisd up before must, whose Erection Rather Reduction was than Resurrection. Thy Humane Nature in the Cock-Pit dread, Like as the morning birds when day peeps, strout Stands Crowing ore the Grave, laid Death there dead, And ore its Carkass neckt, doth Crow about, Throws down the Prison doors, comes out, and lay Them ope that th'Prisoners may come away. But Lord strike down the iron Gate also Of Spirituall Death. Unprison thus my Soule. Breath in the Realm of Life on it bestow, And in thy Heavenly Records me enrowle. And then my bird shall Crow thus roosted high Death, where's thy Sting? Grave, where's thy Victory? The Golden Twist of Unity Divine Lord make the Ligaments to ty mee fast Unto thyselfe, a Member with this twine Binde me to thee, For this will ever last. My Tunes shall rap thy prayses then good Store In Death upon the Resurrection Doore. 40. Meditation. Col. 1.18. That in all things he might have the Preheminence. 1701. Under thy Rod, my God, thy smarting Rod, That hath off broke my James, that Primrose, Why? Is't for my sin? Or Triall? Dost thou nod At me, to teach mee? or mee sanctify? I needed have this hand, that broke off hath This Bud of Civill, and of Sacred Faith. But doth my sickness want such remedies, As Mummy draind out of that Body spun Out of my bowells first? Must th'Cure arise Out of the Coffin of a pious son? Well: so be it. I'le kiss the Rod, and shun To quarrell at the Stroake. Thy Will be done. Yet let the Rose of Sharon spring up cleare, Out of my James his ashes unto mee, In radient sweet and shining Beames to cheer My sorrowfull Soule, and light my way to thee. Let thy Preheminence which, Lord, indeed Ore all things is, me help in time of need. Thy Humane nature so divinely ti'de Unto thy Person all Divine's a Spring So high advanc'd, that in it doth reside Preheminence large over ev'ry thing. Thy Humane flesh with its Perfections shine So 'bove all others Beauties in their prime. The like ne're seen in Heaven, nor Earth so broad. Adorn'd with Graces all, grown ripe in glory. Thy Person with all Excellency stowd Perfections shine is lodgd in ev'ry story. Here all Created, all Creating faire, And Increated Eminences are. Here all Preheminence of Offices Priest, Prophet-King-Hood too, their glorys rise Conferrd on thee, my Lord, and all their Keyes That open us thy shining Mysteries Which do enflame our hearts their heads to run Under the shining Wings of this bright Sun. Lord lead my sight to thy Preheminence. Raise thou in mee right feare of thee thereby. My Love to thee advance till it Commence In all Degrees of Love, a Graduate high. When thy Preheminence doth ply this pin, My Musick shall thy Praises sweetly bring. 41. Meditation. Heb. 5.8. He learned by the things which he suffered. 6.5m [July] 1701. That Wisdom bright whose vastness for extent Commensurates Dimension infinite A Palace built with Saphir-Battlement Bepinkt with Sun, Moon, Starrs, all gold-fire bright, Plac'de man his Pupill here, and ev'ry thing, With loads of Learning, came to tutor him. But he (alas) did at the threashould trip Fell, Crackt the glass through which the Sun should shine That darkness gross his noble Soule doth tip. Each twig is bow'd with loads of follies Rhime. That ev'ry thing in tutoring, is a toole To whip the Scholler that did play the foole. The Case thus stands: Hence matters up arose More sweet than Roses, and out-shine the Sun: That Living Wisdom put on dying Cloaths: In mortal roabs to Sorrows Schoole house run. The Vessell full can hold no more, doth goe To Schoole to learn, whose learning cannot grow. Christ, where all Wisdom's Treasures hidden are, Is Schollar, Suffering's his Tutor-Master: Obedience, is his Lesson, which (as fair As Light in th' Sun) flows from him, yea and faster. But how should he learn any learning more In whom all Learning's ever lodg'd before? Surely it must be said, the Humane Hall, Though furnished with all Ripe Grace, yet was Not all ore Window, that no beame at all Of further light could have into it pass. He grew in Wisdom, Wisdom grew in him As in's, though's Godhead other wayes did't bring. Though Grace in Christ forever perfect was And he e're perfectly was free from Sin His progress yet in Knowledg needs must pass The Passes, humane modes, admit the thing. Hence learnd Obedience in his Suff'ring-Schoole. Experience taught him (though a Feeble toole). O Condescention! Shall the Heavens do Low Conjues to the Earth? or Sun array Itselfe with Clouds, and to a Glow worm go For Light to make all o're the World light day? That thou should learn in Sorrows Schoole, in whom All learning is, and whence all learnings come? Wonder, my Soule, at this great Wonder bright And in this frame, Lord, let my heart to thee On Angells Wings fly, out of Earths Eyesight. Obedience learn in Sorrows Schoole of thee Till right Obedience me hath handed in Among thy Palace Songs thy praise to sing. 42. Meditation. Heb. 10.5. A Body hast thou prepared mee. ???? ?? ????????? ??? 31.6m [Aug.] 1701. I fain would prize thee, Lord, but finde the price Of Earthy things to rise so high in mee That I no pretious matter in my choice Can finde within my heart to offer thee. The price of worldly toyes is grown so deare, They pick my purse. Thy Gaine is little there. But oh! if thou one Sparke of heavenly fire Wilt but drop on my hearth; its holy flame Will burn my trash up. And refin'de desire Will rise to thee in th'Curlings of the same, As Pillars of Perfumeing incense rise, And Surges bright of Glory, 'bove the Skies. Oh! that my Soul was Walled round about With Orient Pearle fetcht out of holy Mine And made a Castle, where thy Graces stoute Keep garison against my foes and thine. Then they each peeping thought sent Scout of Sin Would quickly take, and gibbit up therein. But oh! the Swarms of enemies to thee (Bold Sawceboxes) make in these quarters spoile, Make insurrection 'gainst the motions free Of thy good Spirit: Lord, come, scoure the Ile Of these and quarter here each flourishing grace. The Whole will then be in a Wealthy Case. Thou for this end, a Body hadst preparde, Where Sin ne'er set a foot, nor shewd its head But ev'ry grace was in it, and Well far'de. Whose fruite, Lord, let into my heart be shed. Then grace shall grace my Soule, my Soule shall thee Begrace, and shall thy gracefull Palace bee. Thy Body is a Building all like mine, In Matter, Form, in Essence, Properties. Yet Sin ne'er toucht it, Grace ne'er ceast in't'shine. It, though not Godded, next to th'Godhead lies. This honour have I, more than th'Angells bright. Thy Person, and my Nature do Unite. Oh! Thanks, my Lord, accept this dusty thing: If I had better, thou should better have. I blush, because I can no better bring: The best I do possess, I for thee save. Wash in thy blood, my gift till white it bee: And made acceptable to God by thee. In humble wise I thee implore to make Me, what thou, and thy Father ever love. Empt me of Sin: Fill mee with Grace: and take Up while I'me here, my heart to thee above. My Soule shall sing Thanksgiving unto thee, If thou wilt tune it to thy praise in mee. 43. Meditation. Rom. 9.5. God blessed forever. 26.8m [Oct.] 1701. When, Lord, I seeke to shew thy praises, then Thy shining Majesty doth stund my minde, Encramps my tongue and tongue ties fast my Pen, That all my doings, do not what's designd. My Speeche's Organs are so trancifide My words stand startld, can't thy praises stride. Nay Speeches Bloomery can't from the Ore Of Reasons mine, melt words for to define Thy Deity, nor t'deck the reechs that sore From Loves rich Vales, sweeter than hony rhimes. Words though the finest twine of reason, are Too Course a web for Deity to ware. Words Mentall are syllabicated thoughts: Words Orall but thoughts Whiffld in the Winde. Words Writ, are incky, Goose quill-slabbred draughts, Although the fairest blossoms of the minde. Then can such glasses cleare enough descry My Love to thee, or thy rich Deity? Words are befould, Thoughts filthy fumes that smoake, From Smutty Huts, like Will-a-Wisps that rise From Quaugmires, run ore bogs where frogs do Croake, Lead all astray led by them by the eyes. My muddy Words so dark thy Deity, And cloude thy Sun-Shine, and its Shining Sky. Yet spare mee, Lord, to use this hurden ware. I have no finer Stuff to use, and I Will use it now my Creed but to declare And not thy Glorious Selfe to beautify. Thou art all-God: all Godhead then is thine Although the manhood there unto doth joyne. Thou art all Godhead bright, although there bee Something beside the Godhead in thee bright. Thou art all Infinite although in thee There is a nature pure, not infinite. Thou art Almighty, though thy Humane tent Of Humane frailty upon earth did sent. He needs must be the Deity most High, To whom all properties essensiall to The Godhead do belong Essentially And not to others: nor from Godhead go And thou art thus, my Lord, to Godhead joynd. We finde thee thus in Holy Writ definde. Thou art Eternall; Infinite thou art; Omnipotent, Omniscient, Erywhere, All Holy, Just, Good, Gracious, True, in heart, Immortal, though with mortall nature here. Religious worship hence belongs to thee From men and angells: all, of each degree. Be thou my God, and make mee thine Elect To kiss thy feet, and worship give to thee: Accept of mee, and make mee thee accept. So I'st be safe, and thou shalt served bee. I'le bring thee praise, buskt up in Songs perfum'de, When thou with grace my Soule hast sweetly tun'de. 44. Meditation Joh. 1.14. The word was made Flesh. 28.10m [Dec.] 1701. The Orator from Rhetorick gardens picks His Spangled Flowers of sweet-breathd Eloquence Wherewith his Oratory brisk he tricks Whose Spicy Charms Eare jewells do commence. Shall bits of Brains be candid thus for eares? My Theme claims Sugar Candid far more cleare. Things styld Transcendent, do transcende the Stile Of Reason, reason's stares neere reach so high. But Jacob's golden Ladder rounds do foile All reasons Strides, wrought of theanthropie. Two Natures distance-standing, infinite, Are Onifide, in person, and Unite. In Essence two, in Properties each are Unlike, as unlike can be. One All-Might A Mite the other; One Immortall fair. One mortall, this all Glory, that all night. One Infinite, One finite. So for ever: Yet oned are in Person, part'd never. The Godhead personated in Gods Son Assum'd the Manhood to its Person known, When that the Manhoods essence first begun That it did never Humane person own. Each natures Essence e're abides the same. In person joynd, one person each do claim. Oh! Dignifide Humanity indeed: Divinely person'd: almost Deifide. Nameing one Godhead person, in our Creed, The Word-made-Flesh. Here's Grace's 'maizing stride. The vilst design, that villany e're hatcht Hath tap't such Grace in God, that can't be matcht. Our Nature spoild: under all Curses groans Is purg'd, tooke, grac'd with grace, united to A Godhead person, Godhead-person owns Its onely person. Angells, Lord its so. This Union ever lasts, if not relate Which Cov'nant claims Christs Manhood, separate. You Holy Angells, Morning-Stars, bright Sparks, Give place: and lower your top gallants. Shew Your top-saile Conjues to our slender barkes: The highest honour to our nature's due. Its neerer Godhead by the Godhead made Than yours in you that never from God stray'd. Here is good anchor hold: and argument To anchor here, Lord, make my Anchor stronge And Cable, both of holy geer, out sent And in this anch'ring dropt and let at length. My bark shall safely ride then though there fall On't th'strongest tempests hell can raise of all. Unite my Soule, Lord, to thyselfe, and stamp Thy holy print on my unholy heart. I'st nimble be when thou destroyst my cramp And take thy paths when thou dost take my part. If thou wilt blow this Oaten Straw of mine, The sweetest piped praises shall be thine. 45. Meditation. Col. 2.3. In whom are hid all the Treasures of Wisdom. 15.12m [Feb.] 1701. My head, my Lord, that ivory Cabinet 'S a nest of Brains dust, dry, ne're yet could Ware The Velvet locks of Vertue for its deck Or golden Fleece of Wisdoms virdent hair. The Scull without, not fring'd with Wisdom fleece. The pan within a goose pen full of geese. There Reason's wick yarn-like ore twisted Snarles Chandled with Sensuall tallow out doth blaze A smoaky flame upon its hurden harles That Wil-a-Wisps it into boggy wayes. Melt off this fat, my Reason make thy Candle And light it with thy Wisdom's flames that spangle. Thy Person's Wisdoms Sparkling Treasury: Consisting of two natures: One of which Runs parallell with blest infinity All treasures here of Wisdom ever pitch. Wise Counsills all, of everlasting date, And Wisdom them t'effect, here sits in state. Th'other's a Locker of a Humane frame With richer than Corinthian Amber tills And Shelves of Emralds. Here to deck the same All Wisdom that's Created comes, and fills. Created Wisdom all and all its Wealths Of Grace are treasur'de in these Tills and Shelfes. Like to a Sparkling Carbuncle up Caskt Within a Globe of Chrystall glass most cleare Fills 't all with Shine which through its sides are flasht And makes all glorious Shine: so much more here These treasures of thy Wisdom shine out bright In thee. My Candle With thy Flame, Lord, Light. Or as the Sun within its Azure bowre That guilds its Chrystall Walls with golden rayes It from its bowl like body, light out poures Exiling darkness, making glorious dayes All Wisdom so, and Wisdoms Treasures all Are shining out in thee, their Arcinall. Unlock thy Locker, make my faith Key here To back the Wards. Lord ope the Wicket gate And from thine Emrald Shelves, and Pinchase there A beame of every sort of Wisdom take And set it in the Socket of my Soule To make all day within, and night controle. And from these tills, and drawers take a grain Of evry sort of Sanctifying grace Wherewith impregnate thou the former beame. Set in my Soule a lamp to light that place That so these beames let in, may generate Grace in my Soule, and so an Holy State. If wisdom in the Socket of my heart And Grace within its Cradle rockt do shine My head shall ware a frindg of Wisdoms art. Thy grace shall guild this pilgrim life of mine. Thy Wisdom's Treasure thus Conferrd on mee Will have my glory all Conferrd on thee. 46. Meditation. Col. 2.9. The Fulness of the Godhead dwelleth in him bodily. 10.3m [May] 1702. I drown, my Lord. What though the Streame I'm in Rosewater bee, Or Ocean to its brinkes Of Aqua Vitae where the Ship doth swim? The Surges drown the Soul, oreflowd, that sinks. A Sea of Liquid gold with rocks of pearle May drownd as well as Neptune's Fishy Well. Thy Fulness, Lord, my Filberd cannot hold. How should an acorn bowle the Sea lade dry? A Red rose leafe the Suns bright bulk up fold? Or halfe an Ants egge Canopy the Sky? The world play in a Sneale horn Hide, and Seek May, ere my thimble can thy fulness meete. All fulness is in thee my Lord, and Christ. The fulness of all Excellence is thine. All's palac'de in thy person, and bespic'de. All Kinds, and Quantities of't in thee shine. The Fulness of the Godhead in respect Unto the Manhood's in thy person kept. Hence all the Properties, that Godhead hath, And all their Godhead Operations brave, Which are the Fulness Godhead forth display'th, Thy person for their Temple ever have. All always as transcendent Stones bright, set, Encabin'd are in thee their Cabbinet. Oh! what a Lord and Lordship's here my Lord? How doth thy Fulness, fill thy Hall with Shine? Some Rayes thereof my Cottage now afford And let these golden rayes its inside line. Thy Fulness all, or none at all, Will goe Together, and in part will never flow. All, Lord, or None at all! this makes mee dread. All is so Good, and None at all so bad. All puts faith to't: but none at all strikes dead. I'le hope for all, lest none at all makes sad. Hold up this hope. Lord, then this hope shall sing Thy praises sweetly, spite of feares Sad Sting. 47. Meditation. Joh. 5.26. The Son hath life in himselfe. 12.5m [July] 1702. Noe mervaile if my mite amaized bee Musing upon Almighties Mighty ALL In all its Fulness socketed in thee As furniture, my Lord, to grace thy Hall. Thy Work requires that so the Case should goe. But oh! what Grace doth hence to Sinners flow? I strike mine oare not in the golden Sea Of Godhead Fulness, thine essentially. But in the Silver Ocean make my way Of All Created Fulness, thine Most high. Thy Humane Glass, God wondrously did build: And Grace oreflowing, with All fulness Filld. Thou dost all Fulness of all Life possess. Thy Life all varnisht is with virdent flowers 'Bove Sense and Reason in their brightest dress. Lifes best top gallant ever in thee towers. The Life of Grace that Life of Life within Thy knot in heavenly Sparks is flourishing. Besides thy proper Lifes tall fulness-Wealth, There's Life in thee, like golden Spirits, stills, To ery member of thy Mystick Selfe, Through secret Chases into th'vitall tills Or like the Light embodi'd in the Sun That to each living thing with life doth run. A Well of Living Water: Tree of Life From whom Life comes to every thing alive: Some Eate and Drink Eternall Life most rife. Some life have for a while by a reprive. Who in this well do let their bucket down Shall never in the lake of Lethe drown. Lord, bath mee in this Well of Life. This Dew Of Vitall Fruite will make mee ever live. My branch make green: my Rose ware vivid hew An Holy and a fragrant sent out give. My kirnell ripe shall rattle out thy praise And Orient blush shall on my actions blaze. 48. Meditation. Rev. 1.8. The Almighty. 13.7m [Sept.] 1702. O! What a thing is Might right mannag'd? 'Twill That Proverb brain, whose face doth ware this paint. (Might ore goe's Right) for might doth Right fulfill Will Right revive when wrong makes Right to faint. Might hatches Right: Right hatches Might, they are Each Dam, and Chick, to each: a Lovely paire. Then Might well mannag'd riseth mighty: yet Doth never rise up to Almightiness. Almightiness nere's in a mortall bit. But, Lord, thou dost Almightiness possess. Might in it's fulness: all mights Fulness bee Of ery Sort and Sise stow'd up in thee. But what am I, poor Mite, all mightless thing! That cannot rive a rush, that I should e're Adventure t'dress Almighty up, or bring Almightiness deckt in its mighty geere? Then spare my Stutting Stamring, inky Quill, If it its bowells on thy Power distill. My Mite (if I such Solicisms might But use) would spend its mitie Strength for thee Of Mightless might, of feeble stronge delight. Its little ALL thy Sacrifice showld bee. For thee't would mock at all the Might and Power That Earth, and Hell possess: and on thee shower. A Fig for Foes, for Divells, Hell, and all The powres of darkness, thou now on my Side Their Might's a little mite, Powers powerless fall. My Mite Almighty will not let down slide. I will not trust unto this Might of mine: Nor in my Mite distrust, while I am thine. Thy Love Almighty is, to Love mee deare, Thy Grace Almighty mee to save: thy Truth Almighty to depend on. Justice cleare Almighty t'justify, and judge. Grace shewth. Thy Wisdom too's Almighty all to eye, And Holiness is such to sanctify. If thy Almightiness, and all my Mite United be in sacred Marriage knot, My Mite is thine: Mine thine Almighty Might. Then thine Almightiness my Mite hath got. My Quill makes thine Almightiness a String Of Pearls to grace the tune my Mite doth sing. 49. [Meditation.] Joh. 1.14. Full of Grace. 8.9m [Nov.] 1702. Gold in its Ore, must melted be, to bring It midwift from its mother womb: requires To make it shine and a rich market thing, A fining Pot, and Test, and melting fire. So do I, Lord, before thy grace do shine In mee, require, thy fire may mee refine. My Flame hath left its Coale, my fire's gone t'bed: Like Embers in their ashie lodgen gray. Lord let the Influences of thy head Most graciously remoove this rug away. If with the Bellows of thy grace thou blow My ashes off, thy Coale will shine, and glow. Thy Clay, and Mine, out of one pit are dug: Although with Spades of vastest differing kinde. Thine all bright Godhead; mine of mortall Wood. Thine shod with Glory; Mine with Sin all rin'de. Thy Soule, and Mine made of one minerall And each made regent o're their Clayie Hall. But oh! alas! mine's Wall is worm-hold, and My House and Household sogd with noisom Sin And no reliefe can have in Creature's hand While thine all Sparkling Shines without, and in, Fild with all Grace, and Graces Fullness all Adorning of thy Household and thy Hall. But woe is mee. Unclean I am: my Slips! Lord, let a Seraphim a live Coale take Off of thine Altar, with it touch my lips. And purge away my Sins for mercys sake. I thus do pray finding thy Cask within With Grace, and graces fulness fild to th'brim. I empty, thou top full, of Grace! Lord, take A Gracious Cluster of thy glorious grace And busk it in my bosom, Sweet to make It, and my life: and gracious, in thy face. If thou with gracious Sweetness sweeten mee My Life with Grace sweetly perfum'd shall bee. Can I a graceless member be of thee, While that thy hand's a Spring of Grace? and Heart All gracious is to give? Then influence mee With thy free Grace. Thou art my lovely marke. When thy rich Grace doth tune my Song, sung high Thy Glory then shall rise its melody. 50. Meditation. Joh. 1.14. Full of Truth. 27.10m [Dec.] 1702. The Artists Hand more gloriously bright, Than is the Sun itselfe, in'ts shining glory Wrought with a stone axe made of Pearle, as light As light itselfe, out of a Rock all flory Of Precious Pearle, a Box most lively made More rich than gold Brimfull of Truth enlaid. Which Box should forth a race of boxes send Teemd from its Womb such as itselfe, to run Down from the Worlds beginning to its end. But, o! this box of Pearle Fell, Broke, undone. Truth from it flew: It lost Smaragdine Glory: Was filld with Falshood: Boxes teemd of Sory. The Artist puts his glorious hand again Out to the Worke: His Skill out flames more bright Now than before. The worke he goes to gain, He did portray in flaming Rayes of light. A Box of Pearle shall from this Sory, pass More rich than that Smaragdine Truth-Box was. Which Box, four thousand yeares, o'r ere 'twas made, In golden Scutchons lay'd in inke Divine Of Promises, of a Prophetick Shade, And in embellishments of Types that shine. Whose Beames in this Choice pearle-made-Box all meet And bedded in't their glorious Truth to keep. But now, my Lord, thy Humane Nature, I Doe by the Rayes this Scutcheon sends out, finde Is this Smaragdine Box where Truth doth ly Of Types, and Promises, that thee out lin'de. Their Truth they finde in thee: this makes them shine. Their Shine on thee makes thee appeare Divine. Thou givst thy Truth to them, thus true they bee. They bring their Witness out for thee. Hereby Their Truth appeares emboxt indeed in thee: And thou the true Messiah shin'st thereby. Hence Thou, and They make One another true And They, and Thou each others Glory shew. Hence thou art full of Truth, and full dost stand, Of Promises, of Prophesies, and Types. But that's not all: All truth is in thy hand, Thy lips drop onely Truth, give Falshood gripes. Leade through the World to glory, that ne'er ends By Truth's bright Hand all such as Grace befriends. O! Box of Truth! tenent my Credence in The mortase of thy Truth: and Thou in Mee. These Mortases, and Tenents make so trim, That They and Thou, and I ne'er severd bee. Embox my Faith, Lord, in thy Truth a part And I'st by Faith embox thee in my heart. 51. Meditation. Eph. 1.23. Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all. 14.12m [Feb.] 1702. My Heart, my Lord, 's a naughty thing all o're: Yet if renew'd, the best in mee, 't would fain Find Words to waft thy praises in, ashore, Suited unto the Excellence in thee. But easier 't is to hide the Sun up under Th'black of my naile, than words to weald this Wonder. Had I Corinthian Brass: nay Amber here Nay Ophir Gold transparently refinde. Nay, th'heavenly Orbs all Quintessenced clear, To do the deed, 't would quite deceive my minde: Words all run wast, so these a nit may Weigh: The World in scale, ere I thy wealth display. Then what doe I, but as the Lady Bee Doth tune her Musick in her mudd wall Cell: My Humming so, no musick makes to thee: Nor can my bagpipes play thy glory well. Amaizd I stand to see thee all Compleate: Compleated by a body, thou makst neate. Thy Church, (what though its matter of it here Be brightest Saints, and Angells, all Compact With Spirituall Glow, with grace out shining cleare And brimfull full of what the World ere lackt) Whom thou hast filld with all her fulness, shee Thy fulness is, and so she filleth thee. Oh! wondrous strange. Angells and Men here are Incorporated in one body tite. Two kinds are gain'd into one mortase, fair. Me tenent in thyselfe my Lord, my Light. These are thy body: thou their head, we see Thou fillst them first, then they do fill up thee. This gracious fulness thus runs to and fro From thee to them: from them to thee again: Not as the tides that Ebbe, as well as flow. The Banks are ever Full, and so remain. What mystery's here. Thou canst not wanty bee. Yet wantest them, as sure as they want thee. Necessity doth in the middle stand Layes hands on both: constrains the body to The head and head unto the body's band. The Head, and Body both together goe. The Head Compleats the body as its such: The Body doth Compleate the Head, as much. Am I a bit, Lord, of thy Body? Oh! Then I do claim thy Head to be mine own. Thy Heads sweet Influence let to mee flow, That I may be thy fulness, full up grown. Then in thy Churches fullness thou shalt be Compleated in a Sense, and sung by mee. 52. Meditation. Mat. 28.18. All Power in Heaven, and Earth is given mee. 11.2m [Apr.] 1703. What Power is this? What all Authoritie In Earth and Heaven too? What Lord is here? And given All to thee! Here's Majisty. All Worldly Power hence slinks away for feare. Then blush, my Soule that thou dost frozen ly: Under the beams of such bright Majesty. What flying Flakes of Rapid flames of Love Scal'de from my heart by those bright beams that bed Do in thy selfe, up mount to thee above Oretoping golden mountains with their head. But Why, my heart? O! why so drossy now; When such Authority doth to thee bow? One Sprig of this Authority doth beare The Tree of Life, that spreads ore heaven quite And Sinners sprinkles with its Sap t'make faire. And with its juyce doth quench Gods wrath out right. With God it maketh Reconciliation By offering, and Holy Intercession. Within whose Shade my sin scorcht Soule doth bathe In Gods bright Sun shine, smiling heart-sweet beams. Whose Rosie sents reviv'de my Spirits have. Whose Spirits wash away my guilt and Stains. Amongst whose leaves my heart doth shroude its head And in whose buds my grounded hopes do bed. O that I could once frown away my sloath: And dart my dulness through with glouts that stroy! That mine Affections, (O! their sluggish growth) Might with Seraphick Wings, Lord, swiftly fly, Unto thine Altar for an Holy Cure Produced by a Coale thence took most pure. When this is gain'd, a Golden Trumpet I, All full of Grace shall be, wherein, in rayse Of thy bright Priesthoods sweet Authority My spirit trumpet shall, tun'd to thy praise Till when let this unskilfull ditty still Tunes in thine Eares, pipd through my sorry quill. 53. Meditation. Mat. 28.18. All Power is given me in Heaven, and in earth. 13th.4m [June] 1703. Were not my fancy stagnate, and the Lake Of mine affections frozen ore with ice And Spirits Crampt, or else Catochizate The sweet breath'd smells the briezes of the Spice My Theme doth vent, would raise such waves upon The Sea of Eloquence, they'd skip thereon. Shall I be lumpish when such lightsom showers Of livning influences still on mee? Shall I be lowring, when such lovely flowers Spring smiling up, and Court mee too for thee? When such heart liv'ning glances breake and fly Out through the Sides of thy Authority? Oh! that this, Thine Authority was made A Golden Anvill: and my Contemplation A Smiting Hammer: and my heart was laid Thereon, and hammerd up for emendation. And anvilld stoutly to a better frame To entertain thy rayes that round the same. Thou hast the golden key, that doth unlock, The heart of God: Wisdoms bright Counsills Tower All Power Prophetick This the boundless Stock Of Gods Designs displayes in Gospell Shower. These gleames may liven our dead Spirits then, File bright our rusty brains, and sharpen them. Thou nothing but the Will of God declarst. And nothing less: For thine Authority Should be abusd; if not improov'd, or spar'd. If't more or less than Gods good Will descry. This cannot be abusd: We therefore must The Lesson learn then setst, and therein trust. But here is still another gleame out breakes, All Royall Power in heaven, and earth do lodge In thee, my Lord, this thou wilt not out leake Nor smoother up: it will not hast nor dodge. A right to mannage all things: therefore thou Wilt thine secure, and make thy foes down bow. Thou Law deliverst: Thine Authority Cannot be idle; nor exceed the right. Hence such as will not with thy rule Comply, Thou with thy iron Scepter down wilt smite. This Power will raise the dead, and judge all too. His own will Crown with Life. To hell foes throw. Lord let thy Doctrine melt my Soule anew: And let thy Scepter drill my heart in mee: And let thy Spirits Cotters pierce it through Like golden rivits, Clencht, mee hold to thee. Then thou and I shall ne'er be separate. Thy Praise shall be my Glory sung in state. 54. Meditation. Matt. 28.18. All Power is given mee In Heaven, and in earth. 22th.6m [Aug.] 1703. Untun'de, my Lord. My Cankard brassy wire 'S unfit to harp thee Musick. Angells pipes Are squeaking things: soon out of breath. Desires Exceed them; yet screwd highst up are but mites To meddle with the Musicking thy glory. What then's my jews trump meet to tune thy Story? File off the rust: forgive my Sin, and make My Heart thy Harp: and mine Affections brac'de With gracious Grace thy Golden Strings to shake With Quavers of thy glory well begrac'de. Though small's my mite, its dusty Wings e're will Sprindg out thy fame tun'de by thy Spirits Skill. Three Shining Suns rise in the Chrystall Skies Of Mankinde Orbs, and Orbs Angelicall. Whose Rayes out Shine all pimping Stars that rise Within these Spheres and Circuite through them all. These do evigorate all Action done By men and angells right, wherein they run. The Shine of these three Suns is all the Same, Yet sparkling differently according to The Matter form'd therewith, and beares the Name Authority, and by the Same doth goe, Into a trine of Offices. Hence springs Good warrant, for just Prophets, Priests and Kings. These three are brightest Suns, held in the Skies Or shining Orb of Man, or Angell kinde. And all attain unto a Sovereign Sise Of Shine, that hitherto ascend, we finde. The brightest brightness, and the mighti'st Might Is lodg'd in each one of these Balls of Light. He that hath any one of these, doth weare A Supreme Shine. But all these three Suns came To no man; but alone unto thy Share, My Lord, they fall. Thou hast the Sovereign name. And all the glorious Sunshine of these three Bright Suns, shines bright and powerfull out in thee. Here's three fold glory, Prophet's, Priest's and King's Trible Authority bestud thy Crown. As Mediatour all that Pow're within The Heaven, and Earth is thine. O bright Renown. To view those glories in thy Crown that vapor, Would make bright Angells eyes to run a-water. O! plant mee in thy Priestly Sunshine, I Shall then be reconcild to God. In mee A beame of thy Propheticke Sun imploy. 'Twill fill my Spirits Eye with light to see. Make in my heart thy Kingly Sunshine flame. 'Twill burn my Sin up, sanctify my frame. My Gracious-Glorious Lord, shall I be thine? Wilt thou be mine? Then happy, happy mee! I shall then cloath'd be with the Sun, and shine, Crown'd with tweelve Starrs, Moon under foot too see. Lord, so be it. My rusty Wires then shall Bee fined gold, to tune thee praise with all. 56. Meditation. Joh. 15.24. Had I not done amongst them the works, that none other man hath done, etc. 10.8m [Oct.] 1703. Should I with silver tooles delve through the Hill Of Cordilera for rich thoughts, that I My Lord, might weave with an angelick skill A Damask Web of Velvet Verse thereby To deck thy Works up, all my Web would run To rags, and jags: so snicksnarld to the thrum. Thine are so rich: Within, Without. Refin'd. No workes like thine. No Fruits so sweete that grow On th'trees of righteousness, of Angell kinde And Saints, whose limbs reev'd with them bow down low. Should I search ore the Nutmeg Gardens shine Its fruits in flourish are but skegs to thine. The Clove, when in its White-green'd blossoms shoots, Some Call the pleasentst sent the World doth show. None Eye e're saw, nor nose e're smelt such Fruits My Lord, as thine, Thou Tree of Life in'ts blow. Thou Rose of Sharon, Vallies Lilly true Thy Fruits most sweet and Glorious ever grew. Thou art a Tree of Perfect nature trim Whose golden lining is of perfect Grace Perfum'de with Deity unto the brim, Whose fruits, of the perfection, grow, of Grace. Thy Buds, thy Blossoms, and thy fruits adorne Thyselfe, and Works, more shining than the morn. Art, natures Ape, hath many brave things done As th'Pyramids, the Lake of Meris vast The Pensile Orchards built in Babylon, Psammitich's Labyrinth. (arts Cramping task) Archimedes his Engins made for war. Romes Golden House. Titus his Theater. The Clock at Strasburgh, Dresdens Table-Sight Regiamonts Fly of Steele about that flew. Turrian's Wooden Sparrows in a flight. And th'Artificiall man Aquinas slew. Mark Scaliota's Lock, and Key and Chain Drawn by a Flea, in our Queen Betties reign. Might but my pen in natures Inventory Its progress make, 't might make such things to jump All which are but Inventions Vents or glory Wits Wantonings, and Fancies frollicks plump. Within whose maws lies buried Times, and Treasures Embalmed up in thick dawbd sinfull pleasures. Nature doth better work than Art: yet thine Out vie both works of nature and of Art. Natures Perfection and the perfect shine Of Grace attend thy deed in ev'ry part. A Thought, a Word, and Worke of thine, will kill Sin, Satan, and the Curse: and Law fulfill. Thou art the Tree of Life in Paradise, Whose lively branches are with Clusters hung Of Lovely fruits, and Flowers more sweet than spice Bende down to us: and doe out shine the sun, Delightfull unto God, doe man rejoyce The pleasentst fruits in all Gods Paradise. Lord feed mine eyes then with thy Doings rare, And fat my heart with these ripe fruites thou bearst. Adorn my Life well with thy works, make faire My Person with apparrell thou prepar'st. My Boughs shall loaded bee with fruits that spring Up from thy Works, while to thy praise I sing. 58. Meditation. Math. 2.15. Out of Egypt have I called my Son. 5.10m [Dec.] 1703. When in Italian flourisht hand I would Lord, flourish up thy praise, my Quills too dry, My Inke too thick and naught (though liquid Gold) That will not write, this will not run, nay I My Standish finde is empty, Paper loose That drains all blotches from my inkie Sluce. What shall I then, Lord, doe? Desist thy praise? Thou Canst amend it. Steep my Stubborn Quill In Zions Wine fat, mend my pen, and raise Thy right arms Vean, a drop of'ts blood distill Into mine inkhorn, make my paper tite That it mayn't blot. In Sacred Text I write. Christen mine Eyeballs with thine Eye Salve then, Mine Eyes will spy how Isra'ls journying Into, and out of Egypt's bondage Den A Glass thy vissage was imbellisht in. Hunger Constrains. Jacob to Egypt highs. Herod Constrains and Christ to Egypt flies. God Jacob calls. Jacobs Son Joseph there Him brings and nourisht there, and God doth call Jacobs Son Joseph, Jesus brings there, where He nourisht him. This spills the Dragons gall And broke that aching tooth that at him snapt In Herods jaw bone and his Chops it flapt. God Israel calls from Egypt: up he 'pears. God calls his Son from Egypt: up he highs. The Wilderness tries Isr'el 40 years. Christ 40 days in Wilderness tride lies. The Cockatrice's egg in Jewry hatcht He shuns, and Nazareth doth him inlatch. But Isra'ls coming out of Egypt thus, Is such a Coppy that doth well Descry Not onely Christ in person unto us. But Spirituall Christ, and Egypt Spiritually. Egyptian Bondage whence gates Israel shows The Spirituall bondage whence Christs children goe. The Bondage State to Sin and Satan stand, In Peckled Black, red hellish Colours laid, By wicked Pharao and his hellish hand On Egypts Bondage in the brickiln trade. God Israel Calls . . . Pharao and Egypt grin. God calls the Soule. Satan now greatens Sin. God miracles doth work. Wonders out fly, Like flocks of birds with golden wings, and Claws. For Israels Sake, Pharao and Egypt fry In fiery Wrath. Israel attends Gods Cause. So here, when once the Soule doth Gods call heare Satan red mad doth rage. Wonders appeare. Isra'l Complies: runs into fire by this, Which Pharao's Wrath, and Egypts rage procure. Now Farewell Goshen; Farewell Rameses. Your Pleasures and Commotions we abjure. So here the Soule attends Gods Call. Farewell Worlds Smiling Sunshine. Tole your passing bell. Out Israel comes to Succoth, and from thence To Etham. God his banner ore them bright Erects His Cloude and firy pillard fence A Fence from foes. Lanthorn makes day of night. Pharao, and's Peers, horse, hosts and Charet wheels Rise and with flaming Swords persue at heels. So here, the Soul Call'd to Effect out goes To Succoth, to Gods tabernacles wings, The firy flag, God, banner ore him throws To keep, and Conduct him ins journeyings. Though Hell is all in arms, persues him hard, The Cloud and Fiery Pillar doe him guard. Isra'l thus bannerd Hiroths mouth attempt Whose teeth are Migdol, Baalzephon high. And throate the red Sea, Pharao's host them pent Behinde up, they then terrifide out Cry. Moses his rod divides the red Sea so They safely pass't but Pharao't ore doth flow. So here the Soule on goes into the jaws Of Worldly rage with mountains him do round. Hells armies Chase to tare him with their paws. The red Sea of Gods wrath seems quite to drownd. He Cries, Christs Cross divides the Sea whereby He passeth safe, and it his foes doth stroy. Isra'l sings praise, but yet finds weeping Cheere. Wilderness State is his and waters are At Mara bitter. Yet God sheweth here A tree whose wood did sweetly them repare. So here the Soul sings praise in Christ, yet shall The wilderness work griefe, but Christ makes all. Isra'l to Elim comes. Sweet joyes here findes Twelve Springs of Water Every tribe a Well, And Seventy Palm trees fruitfull to their minde A type that might things past, and future tell. Twelve Patriarchs the wells they sprung from so, And Seventy Elders that from them did flow. So here the Soule in Christ at twelve wells, drinks Of Living waters, twelve Apostles shewd Dates bore by seventy Palms set at their brinks The Seventy disciples, are this food. The Holy Scriptures, and Christs Doctrine are Waters these Wells, and Dates these Palm trees bare. Hence Israel goes the red Sea back to see, To minde him of the mercy shewn him there, And thence into the Wilderness goes hee Of Sin, where tried, and so to Sinai where By open Covenant God Israel takes His onely Church: and select peoples makes. Gives him his Laws and ordinances just. Erects his Worship, open fellowship Holds with him in the same wherein he must In the desert through various Changes trip Some very sweet, some of a bitter hande, Untill they Come to keep in Canaans land. So here indeed, the Soul in Christ doth back From Elim pass unto the Red Sea deare Of Christ's rich blood the mercy of that track To take more in as he about to viere Thence through the Wilderness of Sin, to rise In Covenant on Zion mount like wise. And here enricht with Holy Oracles And fellowship in holy worship so Through interchanging Course, like miracles, The Diaperd Encheckerd works must goe Of Providences, Honycombs and Stings Till here within Celestiall Canaan sings. What Wisdom's here? My Lord, what Grace? What bright Encheckerd Works, more rich than Rubies fair? Doe thou my Soule with this Rich trade delight And bring mee thus into thy promisd aire Wherein my Virginalls shall play for joy Thy Praise with Zions virgins Company. 59. Meditation. 1 Cor. 10.2. Baptized in the Cloud. 6.12m [Feb.] 1703. Wilt thou enoculate within mine Eye Thy Image bright, My Lord, that bright doth shine Forth in the Cloudy-Firy Pillar high Thy Tabernacles Looking-Glass Divine? What glorious Rooms are then mine Eyeholes made. Thine Image on my windows Glass portrai'd? Oh! Pillar strange, made of a Cloude, and Fire. Whose Stoole is Israels Camp, it sits upon. Whose Skirts doe Canopy that Camp: Whose Spire Doth kiss the Heavens, leading Israel on. Sure't is Christ's Charret drawn by Angells high. The Humane jacket, typ'te, of's Deity. A Sun by night, to Dayify the dark. A Shade by Day, Sunbeames to mollify. The Churches Pilot out her way to mark: Her Quarter Master quarters to descry. Its Christ's Watch tower over his Churches Host, With Angells kept. Tent of the Holy Ghost. Christs Looking Glass that on his Camp gives Shine. Whose backside's pitchy darkness to his foes. A Wall of Fire about his Israel twines To burn up all that offer to oppose: The Mediatory Province in a Map. The Feather in the Tabernacle's Cap. Christ in this Pillar, Godhead-Man'd doth rise The Churches King, to guid, support, Defend. Her Priest to Cleanse her: in the Cloud to baptize. And Reconcile with Incense that ascends. Her Prophet too that Lights her in her way By Night With Lanthorn Fire. With Cloud by day. Then lead me, Lord, through all this Wilderness By this Choice shining Pillar Cloud and Fire. By Day, and Night I shall not then digress. If thou wilt lead, I shall not lag nor tire But as to Cana'n I am journeying I shall thy praise under this Shadow sing. 60[A]. Meditation. Joh. 6.51. I am the Living Bread, that came down from Heaven. 16.2m [Apr.] 1704. Count me not liquorish if my Soule do pine And long for Angells bread of Heavens wheate Ground in thy Quorns, Searcde in the Laws Lawn fine And bakt in Heavens backhouse for our meate. Ist die of Famine, Lord, My Stomach's weak. And if I live, Manna must be my meate. I'm sick; my sickness is mortality And Sin both Complicate (the worst of all). No cure is found under the Chrystall Sky Save Manna, that from heaven down doth fall. My Queasy Stomach this alone doth Crave. Nought but a bit of manna can mee save. This Bread came down from heaven in a Dew In which it bedded was, untill the Sun Remoov'd its Cover lid: and did it shew Disht dayly food, while fourty years do run. For Isra'ls Camp to feast upon their fill Thy Emblem, Lord, in print by perfect Skill. Thou in thy word as in a bed of Dewes Like Manna on thy Camp dost fall and light Hid Manna, till the Sun Shine bright remooves The Rug, and doth display its beauty bright Like pearly Bdellium White and Cleare to set The Sight, and Appetite the same to get. This is a Shining Glass, wherein thy face My Lord, as Bread of Life, is clearly seen. The Bread of Life, and Life of lively Grace Of such as live upon't do flowrish Green. That makes their lives that on it live ascend In heav'nly rayes to heaven that have none end. Refresh my Sight, Lord, with thy Manna's eye. Delight my tast with this sweet Honied Cake. Enrich my Stomach with this Cake bread high. And with this Angells bread me recreate. Lord, make my Soule thy Manna's Golden Pot Within thine Arke: and never more forgot. Here's food for ery day, and th'Seventh too: (Though't never fell upon the Seventh day But on the first, and ery week day new) And now is on the Camp shour'd ery way. Yet where it is not rightly usd it turns To nauseous sent, and doth occasion worms. It's first daye's Mess Disht up in Heavenly Dew. Lord feede mee all wayes with't: it will enable Mee much to live up to thy praise anew. Angells delight, attending on this table. If on this Angell fare I'm fed, I shall Sing forth thy glory with bright Angells all. 60[B]. Meditation. Cor. 10.4. And all drunk the same spirituall drinke. 30.5m [July] 1704. Ye Angells bright, pluck from your Wings a Quill. Make me a pen thereof that best will write. Lende me your fancy, and Angellick skill To treate this Theme, more rich than Rubies bright. My muddy Inke, and Cloudy fancy dark, Will dull its glory, lacking highest Art. An Eye at Centre righter may describe The Worlds Circumferentiall glory vast As in its nutshell bed it snugs fast tide, Than any angells pen can glory Cast Upon this Drink Drawn from the Rock, tapt by The Rod of God, in Horeb, typickly. Sea water straind through Mineralls, Rocks, and Sands Well Clarifi'de by Sunbeams, Dulcifi'de, Insipid, Sordid, Swill, Dishwater stands. But here's a Rock of Aqua-Vitae tride. When once God broacht it, out a River came To bath and bibble in, for Israels train. Some Rocks have sweat. Some Pillars bled out tears. But here's a River in a Rock up tun'd Not of Sea Water nor of Swill. Its beere. No Nectar like it. Yet it once Unbund A River down out runs through ages all. A Fountain opte, to wash off Sin and Fall. Christ is this Horebs Rock, the streames that slide A River is of Aqua Vitae Deare Yet costs us nothing, gushing from his side. Celestiall Wine our Sinsunk souls to cheare. This Rock and Water, Sacramentall Cup Are made, Lords Supper Wine for us to sup. This Rock's the Grape that Zions Vineyard bore Which Moses Rod did smiting pound, and press Untill its blood, the brooke of Life, run ore. All Glorious Grace, and Gracious Righteousness. We in this brook must bath: and with faiths quill Suck Grace, and Life out of this Rock our fill. Lord, oynt me with this Petro oyle. I'm sick. Make mee drinke Water of the Rock. I'm dry. Me in this fountain wash. My filth is thick. I'm faint, give Aqua Vitae or I dy. If in this stream thou cleanse and Chearish mee My Heart thy Hallelujahs Pipe shall bee. 61. Meditation. Joh. 3.14. As Moses lift up the Serpent in the Wilderness so must the Son of man be lift up. 17.7m [Sept.] 1704. My Mights too mean, lend your Angelick might Ye mighty Angells, brightly to define. A piece of burnisht brass, formd Serpent like To Countermand all poison Serpentine. No Remedie could cure the Serpents Bite But One: to wit, The brazen Serpent's Sight. Shall brass the bosoms poison in't Contain A Counter poison, better than what beds In Creatures bosoms? Nay, But its vertue came Through that brass Shapt from God that healing sheds. Its Vertue rode in th'golden Coach of th'eyes Into the Soule, and Serpents Sting defies. So that a Sight of the brazen Serpent hung Up in the Banner Standard of the Camp Was made a Charet wherein rode and run A Healing vertue to the Serpents Cramp. But that's not all. Christ in this Snake shapt brass Raist on the Standard, Crucified was. As in this Serpent lay the onely Cure Unto the fiery Serpents burning bite, Not by its Physick Vertue, (that is sure) But by a Beam Divine of Grace's might Whose Vertue onely is the plaster 'plide Unto the Wound, by Faith in Christs blood di'de. A Sight of th'Artificiall Serpent heales The venom wound the naturall Serpent made. A Spirituall Sight of Christ, from Christ down steals. A Cure against the Hellish Serpents trade. Not that the Springhead of the Cure was found In Christs humanity with sharp thorns Crownd. This Brazen Serpent is a Doctors Shop. On ev'ry Shelfe's a Sovereign remedy. The Serpents Flesh the Sovereign Salve is got Against the Serpents bite, gaind by the eye. The Eyebeames agents are that forth do bring The Sovereign Counter poison, and let't in. I by the fiery Serpent bitt be here. Be thou my brazen Serpent me to Cure. My Sight, Lord, make thy golden Charet cleare To bring thy remedy unto my Sore. If this thou dost I shall be heald: My wound Shall sing thy praises: and thy glory sound. 62. Meditation. Can. 1.12. While the King sitteth at his table, my Spicknard sendeth forth the smell thereof. 18.9m [Nov.] 1704. Oh! thou, my Lord, thou king of Saints, here mak'st A royal Banquet thine to entertain. With rich, and royall fare, Celestiall Cates, And sittest at the Table rich of fame. Am I bid to this Feast? Sure Angells stare, Such Rugged looks, and Ragged robes I ware. I'le surely come, Lord fit mee for this feast: Purge me with Palma Christi from my Sin. With Plastrum Gratiae Dei, or at least Unguent Apostolorum healing bring. Give me thy Sage, and Savory: me dub With Golden Rod, and with Saints Johns Wort good. Root up my Henbain, Fawnbain, Divells bit. My Dragons, Chokewort, Crosswort, Ragwort, vice, And set my knot with Honysuckles, stick Rich Herb-a-Grace, and Grains of Paradise Angelica, yea Sharons Rose the best And Herba Trinitatis in my breast. Then let thy Sweetspike sweat its liquid Dew Into my Crystall Viall: and there swim. And as thou at thy Table in Rich Shew With royal Dainties, sweet discourse as King Dost Welcome thine. My Spiknard with its Smell Shall vapour out perfumed Spirits Well. Whether I at thy Table Guest do sit, And feed my tast: or Wait, and fat mine Eye And Eare with Sights and Sounds, Heart Raptures fit, My Spicknard breaths its sweet perfumes with joy. My heart thy Viall with this spicknard fill. Perfumed praise to thee then breath it will. 63. Meditation. Cant. 6.11. I went down into the Garden of Nuts, to see the fruits etc. 4.12m [Feb.] 1704. Oh that I was the Bird of Paradise! Then in thy Nutmeg Garden, Lord, thy Bower Celestiall Musick blossom should my voice Enchanted with thy gardens aire and flower. This Aromatick aire would so enspire My ravisht Soule to sing with angells Quire. What is thy Church, my Lord, thy Garden which Doth gain the best of Soils? Such Spots indeed Are Choicest Plots empalde with Palings rich And set with slips, herbs best, and best of seed. As th' Hanging Gardens rare of Babylon And Palace Garden of King Solomon. But that which doth excell all gardens here Was Edens Garden: Adams Palace bright. The Tree of Life, and knowledge too were there Sweet herbs and sweetest flowers all sweet Delight A Paradise indeed of all Perfume That to the Nose, the Eyes and Eares doth tune. But all these Artificiall Gardens bright Enameled with bravest knots of Pincks And flowers enspangld with black, red and White Compar'd with this are truely stincking sincks. As Dunghills reech with stinking sents that dish Us out, so these, when balanced with this. For Zions Paradise, Christs Garden Deare His Church, enwalld, with Heavenly Crystall fine Hath every Bed beset with Pearle all Cleare And Allies Opald with Gold, and Silver Shrine. The shining Angells are its Centinalls With flaming Swords Chaunting out Madrigalls. The Sparkling Plants, Sweet Spices, Herbs and Trees, The glorious Shews of aromatick Flowers, The pleasing beauties soakt in sweet breath lees Of Christs rich garden ever upward towers. For Christ Sweet Showers of Grace makes on it fall. It therefore bears the bell away from all. The Nut of evry kinde is found to grow big, With food, and Physick, lodgd within a tower A Wooden Wall with Husky Coverlid, Or Shell flesht ore, or in an Arching bower Beech, Hazle, Wallnut, Cocho, Almond brave Pistick or Chestnut in its prickly Cave. These all as meate, and med'cine, emblems choice Of Spirituall Food, and Physike are which sport Up in Christs Garden. Yet the Nutmeg's Spice A leathern Coate wares, and a Macie Shirt, Doth far excell them all. Aromatize My Soule therewith, my Lord, and spirituall wise. Oh! Sweet Sweet Paradise, Whose Spiced Spring Will make the lips of him asleep to tune Heart ravishing tunes, sweet Musick for our king In Aromatick aire of blesst perfume Open thy garden doore: mee entrance give And in thy Nut tree garden make me live. If, Lord, thou opst, and in thy garden bring Mee, then thy little Linet sweetly Will Upon thy Nut tree sit and sweetly sing Will Crack a Nut and eat the kirnell still. Thou wilt mine Eyes, my Nose, and Palate greet With Curious Flowers, Sweet Odors, Viands Sweet. Thy Gardens Odorif'rous aire mee make Suck in, and out t'aromatize my lungs. That I thy garden, and its Spicie State May breath upon with such ensweetned Songs. My Lungs and Breath ensweetend thus shall raise The Glory of thy garden in its praise. 64. Meditation. Can. 6.11. To seeâif the Vine Flowrisht, and the Pomegranate bud. 2.2m [Apr.] 1705. Oh! that my Chilly Fancy, fluttering soe, Was Elevated with a dram of Wine The Grapes and Pomegranates do yield, that grow Upon thy Gardens Appletrees and Vines. It shouldst have liquour with a flavour fraight To pensil out thy Vines and Pomgranates. But I, as dry, as is a Chip, scarce get A peep hole through thy garden pales at these, Thy garden plants. How should I then ere set The glory out of its brave Cherry trees? Then make my fancy, Lord, thy pen t'unfold Thy Vines and Pomegranates in liquid gold. Whence come thy garden plants? So brave? So Choice? They Almugs be'nt from Ophirs golden land: But Vines and Pomegranates of Paradise Spicknard, Sweet Cane, and Cynamon plants here stand. What heavenly aire is breezing in this Coast? Here blows the Trade winde of the Holy Ghost. Thy Pomegranates that blushy freckles ware Under their pleasant jackets spirituall frize, And Vines, though Feeble, fine, and flowrishing are Not Sibmahs, but mount Zions here arise. Here best of Vines, and Pomegranates up hight, Yea Sharons Rose, and Carmels Lillies White. These trees are reev'd with Gilliads balm each one Myrrh trees, and Lign Aloes: Frankincense, Here planted grow; heres Saffron Cynamon Spicknard and Calamus with Spice Ensenc'd. Oh fairest garden: evry bed doth beare All brave blown flowers whose breath is heavenly aire. Make me thy Vine and Pomegranate to be And in thy garden flowrish fruitfully And in their branches bowre, there then to thee In sweetend breath shall come sweet melody. My Spirit then engrapd and pomegranat'de Shall sweetly sing thee o're thy garden gated. 65. Meditation. Can. 6.11. To see the Fruits of the Vally. 10.4m [June] 1705. The Vines of Lebanon that briskly grew Roses of Sharon in their flowrish fair, The Lillies of the Vallies Beauteous shew And Carmels Glorious Flowery Robes most rare In all their lively looks blusht brisk, appeare Dull Wan lookt things, Lord, to thy Gardens geere. Engedi's Vineyard, that brave Camphire bower, The Cypress Banks and Beds of bravery And Eshcol's Grapes that royall juyce out shower, And Wine of Hesbon in its flavor high With Elevating Sparks stand shrinking, blush To see the flowrish of thy Garden flush. Mount Olivet with Olive Trees full green, The flowrishing Almonds in their smiling ray And Sibma's vaporing Wines that frolick seem Are all unmand as tipsy, slink away As blushing at their manners to behold Thy Nut trees Gardens buds and flowers unfold. Whose Buds not Gracious but pure Grace do shine. Whose blossoms are not sweet but sweetness 'brace Whose Grapes are not Vine berries, but rich Wine: Whose Olives Oyle Springs be'n't, but Oyle of Grace. When pound and presst, they Cordiall juyce bleed all And Spirits Unction. Oh! Sweet Hony fall. These Buds are better than blown Roses fair: These Blossoms fairer bee than Carmels hew: These Vines beare Grapes sweeter than Raisens are. These Nuts are better than ere Nutmegs grew. Olivets Olive's but a grease pots mate To thy Nut Gardens Vine and Pomegranate. In thy Nut Garden make my heart a Bed And set therein thy Spicknard, Cypress, Vine Rose, Olive, Almonds, Pares, Plumbs White, and Red, Pomegranats, Spices, Frankincense divine. If thou dost stud my heart with graces thus My heart shall beare thee fruits perfumed flush. Make thou my Soule, Lord, thy mount Olivet And plant it with thy Olive Trees fair Green, Adornd with Holy blossoms, thence beset With Heavens Olives, Happy to be seen. Thy Sacred Oyle will then make bright to shine My Soul its face, and all the works of mine. Set thou therein thy Pomegranate of State Thy Spice Trees, Cloves and Mace, thy Cynamon. Thy Lemons, Orenges, Nuts, Almonds, Dates, Thy Nutmeg trees and Vines of Lebanon With Lillies Violets Carnations rare. My heart thy Spice box then shall breath sweet aire. My Vine shall then beare Raisens of the Sun, My Grapes will rain May Shower of Sacred Wine. The Smiling Dimples on my Fruits Cheeks hung Will as rich jewells adde unto their Shine. Then plant my heart with thy rich fruit trees sweet And it shall beare thee Fruits stew'd in sweet reech. 66. Meditation. Joh. 15.13. Greater Love hath no man than this That a man lay down his Life for his Friends. 19.6m [Aug.] 1705. O! what a thing is Love? who can define Or liniament it out? Its strange to tell. A Sparke of Spirit empearld pill like and fine In't shugard pargings, crusted, and doth dwell Within the heart, where thron'd, without Controle It ruleth all the Inmates of the Soule. It makes a poother in its Secret Sell Mongst the affections: oh! it swells, its paind, Like kirnells soked untill it breaks its Shell Unless its object be obtained and gain'd. Like Caskd wines jumbled breake the Caske, this Sparke Oft swells when crusht: untill it breakes the Heart. O! Strange Strange Love! 'Stroy Life and't selfe thereby. Hence lose its Object, lay down all't can moove. For nothing rather choose indeed to dy, And nothing be, than be without its love. Not t'be, than be without its fanci'de bliss! Is this Love's nature? What a thing is this? Love thus ascending to its highest twig, May sit and Cherp such ditties. Sing and dy. This highest Note is but a Black-Cap's jig Compar'd to thine my Lord, all Heavenly. A greater love than such man ne'er mentain'd. A greater Love than such thou yet hast gain'd. Thy Love laid down thy Life hath for thy Sheep: Thy friends by grace: thy foes by Nature's Crimes. And yet thy Life more precious is and sweet More worth than all the World ten thousand times. And yet thy Love did give bright Wisdoms Shine In laying down thy precious life for thine. This Love was ne'er adulterate: e're pure. Noe Whiffe of Fancy: But rich Wisdomes Beams, No Huff of Hot affection men endure. But sweetend Chimings of Celestiall gleams Play'd and Display'd upon the golden Wyer That doth thy Human Cymball brave, attire. Thy Love that laid thy life all down for thine Did not thereby destroy itselfe at all. It was preserved in thy Selfe Divine When it did make thy Humane Selfe down fall. And when thy body as the Sun up rose It did itselfe like flaming beames disclose. Lord, let thy Love shine on my Soule! Mee bath In this Celestiall Gleame of this pure Love. O! gain my heart and thou my Love shalt have Clime up thy golden Stares to thee above. And in thy upper Chamber sit and sing The glory of thy Love when Entred in. 67[A]. Meditation. Mal. 4.2. But unto you that Feare my name, shall the Sun of Righteousness arise. 21.8m [Oct.] 1705. My China Ware or Amber Casket bright, Filld with Ambrosian Spirits soakt and Bindg'd, Made all a Mass of Quicken'd metall right, Transparent Silver Bowles with flowers Enfringd Sent to the Temple by king Ptolemy Compard thereto are but vile Trumpery. These Spirits, drawn by heavens Chymistry And Casked up, with Cask Conspire into A Lump of Sacred Fire that actively About thy Sacred Selfe entwine and grow So that this Cask bindgd with these Spirits rise A fearer of Jehovah, holy wise. In acting of the same with Holy Skill And Sanctifying Sight as Shining Eyes Some soure, and muddy Humors soon do still When that the Glass is jumbled up arise Or in its China ware some spot or Dimple, Or Amber Cask unhoopt hath Crack or Wrinkle. The Spirits and the Vial both are sick. The Lump Consisting of them both so trim Is out of trim, sore wounded to the quick Distemperd by ill Humors bred therein. Some poyson's in the golden Cup of wine, That treason works against the king Divine. I fain would purge the poison out, and Cleare The liquor from the musty dregs therein. The Bottle free from Crack, Dint, and bad geer, The China Ware from Spot or Wrinkling And all the Quickend Lump I fain would Cure Of all ill Humors, Sickness, wound, or Sore. But cannot do the same, yet this I finde, To them that feare thy Name Lord, there doth rise The Sun of Righteousness, (this Cheers my minde) With healing in his Wings Physicianwise. This yields reliefe. Some things in such as do The Fear is bad: in them diseases grow. Mine argument let winde into thine heart, That hence I do assume seing its sure None that do feare thee, perfect bee, each part. I'm one of them or none of them I'm sure. If one of them, my bad Distempers shall Not it disproove. I don't excell them all. They want a Cure: and so do I: I'm not Pleasd with my mud: Sin doth not tickle mee. The Wrinkles Crest, or Dints my ware hath got My Sores and Sicknesses my Sorrows bee. I'l strive against them till I'st strive no more. While healing Wings abide, Ile not give o're. The Objects of the Sun of Righteousness Doth with its healing wing rise Cleare upon Have need of healing. I do need no less. Our wants for kinde are equall hereupon. We both are of our sickness sick. Hence shown We both are by the argument proovd one. Hence this I pray, and pray no less than this. Grant, Lord, mine Eyes with acute Sight not dim, Thy Shining Sun of Righteousness may kiss And broodled bee under its Healing Wing. My Bird like to a Nighting gaile in th'Spring With breast on sharpest thorn, thy praise shall sing. 68[A]. Meditation. Mal. 4.2. The Sun of Righteousness, etc. 16.10m [Dec.] 1705. Methinks I spy Almighty holding in His hand the Crystall Sky and Sun in't bright: As Candle and bright Lanthorn lightening, The World with this bright lanthorns flaming light Endungeoning all Darkness underground, Making all Sunshine Day Heavenward abound. The Spirituall World, this world doth, Lord out vie: Its Skie this Crystall Lanthorn doth orematch. Its Sun, thou Art, that in'ts bright Canopy Outshines that Candle, Darkness doth dispatch. Thy Crystall Globe of Glorious Sunshine furld Light, Life and heate in't Sundayeth the World. The World without the Sun,'s as dungeon, darke. The Sun without its Light would Dungeon spring. The Moon and Stars are but as Chilly Sparks Of Dying fire. The Sun Cheeres ery thing. But oh thy Light, Lightsom, delightsom falls Upon the Soul above all Cordialls. All Light delights. Yet Dozde wood light is cold. Some light hath heate yet Darkness doth it bound As Lamp and Glowworm light. The Stars do hold A twinkling lifeless Light. The Sun is found A Ball of Light, of Life, Warmth to natures race. But thou'rt that Sun, that shines out Saving Grace. Doz'de wood-light is but glimmer, with no Smoke. And Candle Light's a smoaky lifeless thing. The light lodgd in the glowworm's peticoate Is but a Shew. Star light's nights twinkling. Moonlight is nightish, Sun makes day: these all Without our Visive Organs lightless fall. But thou, my Lord no Dozed Wood Shine art. No Smoky Candle Light rose from thy Wick. Thy Light ne'er linde the glowworms velvet part. Thy Shine makes Stars, Moons, Sunlight darkness thick. Thou art the Sun of Heavens bright light rose in The Heavenly Orbs. And Heavens blesst glories spring. Were all the trees on earth fir'de Torches made, And all her Grass Wax Candles set on flame This Light could not make day, this lightsom trade Would be a darksom Smoke when Sun shines plaine. But thy Shine, Lord, darkens this Sunshine bright, And makes the Seing Organ, and its Light. Within the Horizontall Hemisphere Of this Blesst Sun, Lord, let mee Mansion have. Make Day, thou Shining Sun, unto mee cleare Thy Sorry Servant earnestly doth crave. Let not the Moon ere intervene or fix Between me and this Sun to make Ecclipse. O! bright, bright Day. Lord let this Sun Shine flow. Drive hence my Sin and Darkness greate profound And up them Coffin in Earths Shade below In darkness gross, on th'other side the ground. Neer let the Soyle spew fogs to foile the Light Of this Sweet Aire pregnant with Sunbeams bright. How shall my Soule (Such thoughts Enravish mee) Under the Canopy of this bright Day Imparadisde, Lightend and Livend bee Bathd in this Sun Shine 'mong bright Angells play And with them strive in sweetest tunes expresst Which can thy glorious praises sing out best. 67[B]. Meditation. Mal. 4.2. With Healing in His Wings. 10.12m [Feb.] 1705. Doe Fables say, the Rising Sun doth Dance On Easter Day for joy, thou didst ascende. O Sun of Righteousness; tho't be a glance Of Falshoods Spectacles on Rome's nose end? And shall not I, furled in thy glorious beams, Ev'n jump for joy, Enjoying such sweet gleams? What doth the rising Sun with its Curld Locks And golden wings soon make the Chilly world Shook with an Ague Fit by night shade drops, Revive, grow brisk, Suns Eyebright on it hurld? How should my Soule then sick of th'Scurvy spring When thy sweet medicating rayes come in? Alas! Sweet Sun of Righteousness, Dost shine Upon such Dunghills, as I am? Methinks My Soule sends out such putrid sents, and rhimes That with thy beams would Choke the aire with Stincks. And Nasty vapors ery where, whereby Thy rayes should venom'd be that from thee fly. The Fiery Darts of Satan stob my heart. His Punyards Thrusts are deep, and venom'd too. His Arrows wound my thoughts, Words, Works, each part They all a bleeding ly by th' Stobs, and rue. His Aire I breath in, poison doth my Lungs. Hence come Consumptions, Fevers, Head pains: Turns. Yea, Lythargy, the Apoplectick Stroke: The Catochee, Soul Blindness, Surdity, Ill Tongue, Mouth Ulcers, Frog, the Quinsie Throate The Palate Fallen, Wheezings, Pleurisy. Heart Ach, the Syncopee, bad stomach tricks Gaul Tumors, Liver grown; spleen evills Cricks. The Kidny toucht, The Iliak, Colick Griefe The Ricats, Dropsy, Gout, the Scurvy, Sore The Miserere Mei. O Reliefe I want and would, and beg it at thy doore. O! Sun of Righteousness Thy Beams bright, Hot Rafter a Doctors, and a Surgeons Shop. I ope my Case to thee, my Lord: mee in Thy glorious Bath, of Sun Shine, Bathe, and Sweate. So rout Ill Humors: And thy purges bring. Administer in Sunbeame Light, and Heate. Pound some for Cordiall powders very small To Cure my Kidnies, Spleen, My Liver, Gaul. And with the same refresh my Heart, and Lungs From Wasts, and Weakness. Free from Pleurisy Bad Stomach, Iliak, Colick Fever, turns, From Scurvy, Dropsy, Gout, and Leprosy From Itch, Botch Scab. And purify my Blood From all Ill Humors: So make all things good. Weave, Lord, these golden Locks into a web Of Spiritual Taffity; make of the same A sweet perfumed Rheum-Cap for my head To free from Lythargy, the Turn, and Pain, From Waking-Sleep, Sin-Falling Mallady From Whimsy, Melancholy Frenzy-dy. Thy Curled Rayes, Lord, make mine Eare Picker To Cure my Deafeness: Light, Ophthalmicks pure To heate my Eyes and make the Sight the Quicker. That I may use Sins Spectacles no more. O still some Beams. And with the Spirits fresh My Palate Ulcerd Mouth, and Ill Tongue dress. And ply my wounds with Pledgets dipt therein. And wash therewith my Scabs and Boils so sore, And all my Stobs, and Arrow wounds come, bring And syrrindge with the Same. It will them Cure. With tents made of these Beams well tent them all. They Fistula'es and Gangrenes Conquour shall. Lord plaster mee herewith to bring soon down My Swellings. Stick a Feather of thy Wing Within my Cap to Cure my Aching Crown. And with these beams Heale mee of all my Sin. When with these Wings thou dost mee medicine I'st weare the Cure, thou th'glory of this Shine. 68[B]. Meditation. Mal. 4.2. Ye shall go forth and grow as Calves of the Stall. 28.2m [Apr.] 1706. My megre Soule, when wilt thou fleshed bee, With Spirituall plumpness? Serpents flesh dost eat Which maketh leane? Thy bones stick out in thee. Art thou Consumptive? And Concoctst not meat? Art not a Chick of th'Sun of Righteousness? Do not its healing Wings thy ailes redress? Hast not Chang'd place with Mercury? And made Thy robes of Broadcloath of the Golden Fleece Of Wooly Sun beams? (O! Warm Shining trade!) Souls freshen sure in Cloaths of such a piece And gloriously dance on these golden Cords. Yet till a Cure is got, Griefe o're them Lords. And if thou bruddled liest, (though Qualms arise) Under the healing wings of this bright Sun Of Righteousness, as Chicken Chearping wise Under its Dam, the Cure is surely Done. Some healing Beam a Certain med'cine brings To all Distemper'd Souls under these wings. This is the Heavenly Alkahest that brings Lean Souls t'ore thrive all Pharao's fattest Ware. Grow like the Stalled Oxe, or Fattlings Plump, Fleshy, Fat, Slick, brisk, and rightly fair. A spirituall fat of Collops, gracious greate Shall Cloath the Whole and make it grace-Compleat. Though th'Wicker bird Cage is of rusty Wyer: This Sunshine will imbellish it and bright. Though th'bird in't of immortall breed, much tire These healing wings will make it fully ripe. My little Pipkin Soule of heavenly Clay Shall fatted to the brim with grace grow gay. My Heade, O Sun, hide in thy healing Wing. Thy Warmth will to my megre Soule flesh give. My growth shall Beauty to thine Eyesight bring. Thy Sight shall make me plump and pleasant live, And all my Growth to thee shall bud with blooms Of Praises Whistling in Angelick Tunes. 69. Meditation. Cant. 2.2. The Lillie of the Vallies. 30.4m [June] 1706. Dull! Dull! my Lord, as if I eaten had A Peck of Melancholy: or my Soule Was lockt up by a Poppy key, black, sad: Or had been fuddled with an Hen bane bowle. Oh, Leaden temper! my Rich Thesis Would Try metall to the back, sharp, it t'unfold. Alas! my Soule, Thy Sunburnt Skin looks dun: Thy Elementall jacket's Snake like pi'de. I am Deform'd, and Uggly all become. Soule Sicknesses do nest in mee: and Pride. I nauseous am: and mine iniquites Like Crawling Worms doe worm eat on my joys. All black though plac'de in a White lilly Grove: Not sweet, though in a bed of Lillies rowle, Though in Physicians shop I dwell, a Drove Of Hellish Vermin range all ore my Soul. All Spirituall Maladies play rex in mee, Though Christ should Lilly of my Vally bee. But, Oh! the Wonder! Christ alone the Sun Of Righteousness, that he might do the Cure The Lilly of the Vallies is become Whose Lillie properties do health restore. It's glory shews I'm filthy: yet must spring Up innocent, and beautifull by him. Its Vally State and Bowing Head declare I'm Haughty but must have a Humble minde. Its Healing Virtue shew I'm sick: yet rare Rich Remedies I'st in this Lilly finde. Yea Christ the Lilly of the Vallies shall Be to mee Glory, Med'cine, Sweetness, all. The Lillies Beautie, and its Fragrancy Shews my ill-favourdness, and Nauseous Stinck: And that I must be beautifull, fully, And breath a Sweetness that the aire must drink. This Beauty, Odour, Med'cin, Humble Case This Vallys Lilly shall my Soul begrace. Lord, make me th'Vally where this Lilly grows. Then I am thine, and thou art mine indeed. Propriety is mutuall: Glorious shows And Oderif'rous breath shall in me breed, Which twisted in my Tunes, thy praise shall ring On my Shoshannim's sweetest Well tun'de string. 70. Meditation. Col. 2.11.12. In whom also ye are Circumcised with Circumcision made without hands, in putting off of the sins of the flesh by the Circumcision of Christ, buried with him in baptism: etc. 25.6m [Aug.] 1706. I humbly Crave this Riddle to unfold Seing, Lord, thou madst man Compleate at first, How comes't to pass When Natures egge, that holds Her Chicken brake, the bird defilde out burst? A Callous doth the Heart Disspiritualize Till Gilgal's Razer doth it Circumcise. Thy first Free Covenant, Calld not for this: Thy Covenant of Graces Quilting kinde, Shall it require a Seale that Cutting is? That fleys the Skin off, that the heart doth rinde? What is Rebellions Castle made the heart, Filld up with filth, to be skin'd off? O sharp. Hath Sin encrusted thus my heart? Sad! Sad! And latcht my Lips? And Eares made deafe, and ditcht? O! Lord! pare off, I pray, what ere is bad: And Circumcise my Heart, mine Eares and Lips. This in thy Circumcisions heart doth bed. The Same in baptism is bosomed. What must Christs Circumcision pacify Gods Wrath? And's Blood of's Circumcision sore, Bring Righteousness, Purge Sin, and Mortify Proude Naughtiness? And wash with Grace mee o're? And my Uncircumcisedness all slay? That I might walke in glorious Graces way? The Infant male must lose its Foreskin first, Before Gods Spirit Workes as Pulse, therein To sanctify it from the Sin in't nurst, And make't in Graces Covenant to spring. To shew that Christ must be cut off most Pure, His Covenantall blood must be mans Cure. And shall this sweet kinde Covenant of Grace Ware on't a Seale so keen and Cutting sharp When it its brightst Edition doth embrace? No, no. Baptism is a better marke. It's therefore Circumcision's Rightfull Heir Bearing what Circumcision in't did beare. Hence me implant in Christ, that I may have His Blood to wash away the filth in mee. And finde his Wounds that are so deep, the grave Wherein my Sins ly dead and buri'de bee. From which let such sweet Exhalations rise As shall my Soule deck with an Holy guise. Lord bed mee in thy Circumcisions Quilt. My wounds bathe with New Covenantall blood. My ears with Grace Lord syringe, scoure off guilt. My Tongue With holy tasled Languague Dub. And then these parts, baptisde thine Organs keep, To tune thy Praise, run forth on golden feet. 71. Meditation. 1 Cor. 5.8. Let us keep the Feast, not with old Leven. 20.8m [Oct.] 1706. Oh! What a Cookroom's here? all Deity Thick blancht all ore with Properties Divine Varnisht with grace that shineth gloriously. Pollisht with glorious folds of brightest Shine Enricht with Heavens Cookery the best The Turtle Dove, and Paschall Lamb's here drest. Oh! Dove most innocent. O Lamb, most White. A spotless Male in prime. Whose blood's the Dier That dies the Doore posts of the Soule most bright. Whose body all is rost at justice's fire And yet no bone is broken, though the Spit Whereon its rost runs speare like, thorow it. This Choicest Cookery is made the Feast Where glories king doth entertain his Guests. Where Pastie past is Godhead, filld at least With Venison, of Paschall Lamb the best. All spic'd and Plumb'd with Grace and disht up right Upon Gods Table Plate Divinely bright. This Spirituall Fare in Ordinances, and The Wine bled from the Holy Grape, and Vine, Thats on the Table orderd by God's hand The Supper of the Lord, the feast Divine God's Gospel Priests this to that Table beare Where Saints are Guests and Angells waiters are. The Wedden garment of Christs Righteousness And Holy Cloathes of Sanctity most pure, Are their atire, their Festivall rich dress: Faith feeds upon the Paschall Lamb its sure That on God's Porslain Dish is disht for them And drinks the Cup studded with graces Gem. Let at this Table, Lord, thy Servant sit, And load my trencher with thy Paschall Lamb. My Doore posts dy with the red blood of it. The stroying angells weapon therewith sham And let my Faith on thy rost mutton feed And Drinke the Wine thy holy grape doth bleed. Lord make my Faith feed on it heartily. Let holy Charity my heart Cement Unto thy Saints: and for a Cordiall high Make mee partaker of thy Sacrament. When with this Paschall bread and Wine I'm brisk I in sweet Tunes thy sweetest praise will twist. 72. Meditation. Mar. 16.19. Sat down on the right hand of God. 15.10m [Dec.] 1706. Enoculate into my mentall Eye The Visive Spirits of the Holy Ghost My Lord, that I may see the Dignity Of thy bright Honour in thy heavenly Coast Thou art deckt with as Sunshine bright displaid That makes bright Angells in it, cast a Shade. Enrich my Phansy with Seraphick Life, Enquicknd nimbly to catch the Beams Thy Honour flurs abroad: in joyous Strife To make sweet Musick on such Happy Themes. That in such Raptures, and Transports of joy, To Honour kings I may my Phansy 'ploy. At God's Right Hand! Doth God mans parts enjoy? This with Infinity can never stande. Yet so God sayes, His Son to Dignify In manhood, said, sit at my right hand. The manhood thus a brighter Honour bears By Deity than Deity ere wares. The Splendor of the matter of each Story Of th'Heavenly Palace Hall all brightend cleare, The Presence Chamber of the King of Glory Common with thee, to Saints and Angells there. They share with thee in this Celestiall Shine. Although their Share is lesser far than thine. Yet they in all this glorious Splendor bright, So many Suns like, shining on each other, Encreasing each's glory, fall down right To kiss thy feet, whose Shine this glorie Covers. Their brightest Shine, in Glory's highest Story, Is t'stand before thee in thy bright-bright glory. Thy Honour brightens theirs, as't on theirs falls. Its Royall Honour thou inheritst, Cleare, A Throne of Glory in bright glories Hall: At Gods right Hand thou sits enthroned there. The Highest Throne in brightest glory thou Enjoyest. Saints, and Angels 'fore thee bow. Come down, bright Angells, Now I claim my place. My nature hath more Honour due, than yours: Mine is Enthron'de at Gods Right-Hand, through Grace. This Grace for mine and not for yours, endures. Yours is not there, unless in part of mine, As Species in their Genus do combine. Hence make my Life, Lord, keep thine Honour bright. And let thine Honour brighten mee by grace. And make thy Grace in mee, thee honour right. And let not mee thy Honour ere deface. Grant me the Honour then to honour thee And on my Bells thine Honour chimed shall bee. 73. Meditation. 1 Tim. 3.16. Received into Glory. 9.12m [Feb.] 1706. Glory! oh Glory! Wonderfull, and more. How dost thou Croude with all thy Ranks most bright? Thou never playdst such Glorious Cast, before Nor ever wor'st such flourishing delight. Thy heart doth leape for joy, to have the gain When thou Receivdst my Lord in Glories Flame. Who can the Ranks of Glory ere relate, As they stand up in Honours Palace Hall? They sparkle Flashing spangles, golden flakes Of burnisht shines, with lowly Conjues all To kisse thy hand, my Lord, and hande thee in To tend thee and attend thee, her head spring. Glory was never glorifide so much, She ne're receiv'd such glory heretofore. As that that doth Embrace her, (it is such,) As she unto my Lord, doth ope her doore. When he receivd was into glory's Sphere Glory then found her glory brightest were. When unto Angell's Glory opens doore, Or unto Saints, all to be glorifi'de, She well bestows herselfe, t'enriche her Store: Yet blushes much to eye thy Glories tide. When she doth make herselfe thy Cloaths to bee, She's cloathd with brighter glory far by thee. The greatest glory glory doth enjoy, Lies in her hanging upon thee Wherein Glory that glorifies thee mightily, Is far more glorifide. Hence Glories spring. Now Graces Glory, Heavens Glory, and Gloryes of Saints, and Angells, guild thy hand. A Glorious Palace, a Bright Crown of Glory A glorious train of Saints, and Angells Shine And glorious exercise as sweetest posy, Do sacrifice themselves unto thy Shrine. They give their all to thee. And so receive Therein from thee a much more brighter Wreath. Let some, my Lord, of thy bright Glories beams, Flash quickening Flames of Glory in mine eye T'enquicken my dull Spirits, drunke with dreams Of Melancholy juyce that stupify. A Coale from thy bright Altars Glory sure Kissing my lips, my Lethargy will Cure. If Envy ere by Sanctifying Skill Could gracious be, or be a Grace, I would I could it on my Spirits Cold and Chill Well Exercise, that Love thus ever should Ly lockt by Melancholy's key up in my Heart. And hardly smile when Glories beautyes dart. Lord make thy beams my frost bit heart to warm. Ride on these Rayes into my bosom's chill And make thy Glory mine affections Charm. Thy rapid flames my Love enquicken will. Then I in Glories Tower thy Praise will sing On my Shoshanims tun'd on ev'ry String. 74. Meditation. Phi. 3.21. His Glorious Body. ?? ?????? ??? ????? ????? 6.2m [Apr.] 1707. I fain would have a rich, fine Phansy ripe That Curious pollishings elaborate Should lay, Lord, on thy glorious Body bright The more my lumpish-heart to animate. But searching ore the Workhouse of my minde, I but one there; and dull and meger finde. Hence, Lord, my Search hand thou from this dark Shop (Its foule, and wanteth Sweeping) up unto Thy Glorious Body whose bright beames let drop Upon my heart: and Chant it with the Show. Because the Shine that from thy body flows, More glorious is than is the brightest Rose. Sun Shine is to this Glory but a Smoke. Saints in their brightest Shines are clouds therein. Bright Angells are like motes i'th'Sun unto't. Its Beames gild heavens bright Hall, that's sparkling. Of all Created Glory, that doth shine Thy Bodies Glory is most bright and fine. The Beauty of Humanity Compleate, Where ery organ is adepted right, Wherein such Spirits brisk, do act full neate Make Natures operations fully ripe. All Harmonizing in their actions done That ery twig's with glorious blossoms hung. And still more sweet: thou'rt with more glory deckt. The Glory of ripe Grace of brightest kinde Like lumps of living Fire, by nothing Checkt Thrumping the Stars, as pinking things half blinde. This makes thy Bodies glory Choice and fine, A spirituall light in Corporall Lanthorn shine. Yea, still more Glory. Oh! thy Humane Frame Is th'brightst Temple of the Holy Ghost. Whose Rayes run through the Whole in brightest flame. Hence on thy body campeth Glories Hoast. What more can still be said? I add but this. That Glory bright thy Bodies Tilt-Clothe is. Oh! Glorious Body! Pull my eye lids ope: Make my quick Eye, Lord, thy brisk Glory greet, Whose rapid flames when they my heart revoke From other Beauties, make't for thee more sweet. If such blest Sight shall twist my heart with thine, Thy Glory make the Web, thy Praise the Twine. 75. Meditation. Phil. 3. ult. Our Vile Bodie ?? ???? ??? ??????????? ???? 1.4m [June] 1707. Oh! Strang, my Lord. Here's reason at a set. Run out of 'ts Wits, construing Grace's Style. Nay Shining Angells in an holy fret Confounded are, to see our Bodies Vile Made Cabinets of Sparkling Gems that far Out shine the brightest shining heavenly Star. Mudd made with Muscadine int' mortar Rich, Dirt wrought with Aqua-Vitae for a Wall Built all of Precious Stones laid in it, Which Is with leafe gold bespangled, 'maizes all. Yet this Amaizment's scarce a minutes Sise Compar'd unto the matter 'fore our eyes. Here is a Mudwall tent, whose Matters are Dead Elements, which mixt make dirty trade: Which with Life Animall are wrought up faire A Living mudwall by Gods holy Spade. Yet though a Wall alive all spruice, and crouce Its Base, and Vile. And baseness keeps its House. Nature's Alembick 't is, Its true: that stills The Noblest Spirits terrene fruits possess, Yet, oh! the Relicks in the Caldron will Proove all things else, Guts, Garbage, Rotteness. And all its pipes but Sincks of nasty ware That foule Earths face, and do defile the aire. A varnisht pot of putrid excrements, And quickly turns to excrements itselfe, By natures Law: but, oh! there therein tents A sparke immortall and no mortall elfe. An Angell bright here in a Swine Sty dwell! What Lodge of Wonders's this? What tongue can tell? But, oh! how doth this Wonder still encrease? The Soule Creeps in't. And by it's too defil'd. Are both made base, and vile, can have no peace Without, nor in: and's of its Shine beguil'd. And though this Spirit in it dwells yet here Its glory will not dwell with such sad geere. Both grac'd together, and disgrac'd. Sad Case. What now becomes of Gods Electing Love? This now doth raise the Miracle apace, Christ doth step in, and Graces Art improove. He kills the Leprosy that taints the Walls: And sanctifies the house before it falls. And nature here, though mean and base beside, With marks and Stains of Sin, and Sin not dead, Though mortifi'de and dying, in't reside, With Graces precious Pearls its flourished. And in our bodies very vile and base Christ hath enthron'de all sanctifying Grace. That these dark Cells, and Mudwalld Tents defild, With nastiness should Cabinets be made For th'Choicest Pearls in Glories ring enfoild Out shining all the shining starry trade. Its glorious Wonders, wrought by Graces hand, Whereat bright Angells all amaized stand. Oh! make my Body, Lord, Although its vile, Thy Warehouse where Grace doth her treasures lay. And Cleanse the house and ery Room from Soile. Deck all my Rooms with thy rich Grace I pray. If thy free Grace doth my low tent, perfume, I'll sing thy Glorious praise in ery room. 76. Meditation. Phi. 3.21. Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like his Glorious body. 27.5m [July] 1707. Will yee be neighbourly, ye Angells bright? Then lend mee your Admiring Facultie: Wonders presented stand, above my might. That call from mee the highest Extasie. If you deny mee this: my pimping Soule, These Wonders pins up in an Auger hole. If my Rush Candle on its wick ware flame, Of Ignis lambens. Oh! bright garb indeed: What then, when Flakes of flaming Glory train From thy bright glorious bulk to 'ray my weed. What my vile Body like thy Glorious, Formd? What Wonder here? My body thus adornd! What shall mine hempen harle wove in thy Loome Into a web (an hurden web indeed) Be made its Makers Tent Cloth? I presume. Within these Curtains Grace keeps Hall, and breeds: But shall my hurden-hangings ever ware A bright bright Glory like thy body faire? Meethinks thy smile doth make thy Footstoole so Spread its green Carpet 'fore thy feet for joy. And Bryers climb in t'bright Rose that flows Out in sweet reechs to meet thee in the sky: And makes the sportive Starrs play Hide-and-Seek And on thy bodies Glory peeping keep. And shall not I (whose form transformd shall bee To be shap'te like thy glorious body, Lord. That Angells bright, as Gasterd, gaze at mee To see such Glory on my dresser board), Transported be hereat for very joy, Whose intrest lies herein, and gloriously? What shall the frosty Rhime upon my locks, Congeale my brains with Chilly dews, whereby My Phansie is benumbd: and put in Stocks, And thaws not into Steams of reeching joy? Oh! strange Ingratitude! Let not this Frame Abide, Lord, in mee. Fire mee with thy flame. Lord, let thy glorious Body send such rayes Into my Soule, as ravish shall my heart, That Thoughts how thy bright Glory out shall blaze Upon my body, may such Rayes thee dart. My Tunes shall dance then on these Rayes and Caper Unto thy Praise. When Glory lights my Taper. 77. Meditation. Zech. 9.11. The Pit wherein is no water. 5.8m [Oct.] 1707. A State, a State, Oh! Dungeon State indeed. In which mee headlong, long agoe Sin pitcht: As dark as Pitch, where Nastiness doth breed: And Filth defiles: and I am with it ditcht. A Sinfull State: This Pit no Water's in't. A Bugbare State: as black as any inke. I once sat singing on the Summit high 'Mong the Celestiall Coire in Musick Sweet On highest bough of Paradisall joy, Glory and Innocence did in mee meet. I, as a Gold-Fincht Nighting Gale, tun'd ore Melodious Songs 'fore Glorie's Palace Doore. But on this bough I tuning Pearcht not long: Th'Infernall Foe shot out a Shaft from Hell, A Fiery Dart pilde with Sins poison strong: That struck my heart, and down I headlong fell. And from the Highest Pinicle of Light Into this Lowest pit more darke than night. A Pit indeed of Sin: No water's here: Whose bottom's furthest off from Heaven bright, And is next doore to Hell Gate, to it neer: And here I dwell in sad and solemn night, My Gold-Fincht Angell Feathers dapled in Hells Scarlet Dy fat, blood red grown with Sin. I in this Pit all Destitute of Light Cram'd full of Horrid Darkness, here do Crawle Up over head, and Eares, in Nauseous plight: And Swinelike Wallow in this mire, and Gall: No Heavenly Dews nor Holy Waters drill: Nor Sweet Aire Brieze, nor Comfort here distill. Here for Companions, are Fears, Heart-Achs, Grief Frogs, Toads, Newts, Bats, Horrid Hob-Goblins, Ghosts: Ill Spirits haunt this Pit: and no reliefe: Nor Coard can fetch me hence in Creatures Coasts. I who once lodgd at Heavens Palace Gate With full Fledgd Angells, now possess this fate. But yet, my Lord, thy golden Chain of Grace Thou canst let down, and draw mee up into Thy Holy Aire, and Glory's Happy Place. Out from these Hellish damps and pit so low. And if thy Grace shall do't, My Harp I'le raise, Whose Strings toucht by this Grace, Will twang thy praise. 78. Meditation. Zech. 9.11. By the Blood of thy Covenant I have sent forth thy Prisoners out of the Pit wherein is no water. 14.10m [Dec.] 1707. Mine Eyes, that at the Beautious Sight of Fruite On th'Tree of, Knowledge, drew black venom in That did bemegerim my brains at root That they turnd round, and tippled me int' Sin. I thus then in t'Barath'rick pit down fell. Thats Waterless and next doore is to Hell: No water's here: It is a Springless Well. Like Josephs Pit, all dry of Comforts Spring. Oh! Hopeless, Helpless Case: In such I fell. The Creatures buckets dry, no help can bring: Oh, here's a Spring: Indeed its Lethe Lake Of Aqua-Infernales: don't mistake. This Pit indeed's Sins Filthy Dungeon State, No water's in't, but filth, and mire, Sins juyce. Wherein I sinke ore Head, and Eares: sad fate, And ever shall, if Grace hath here no Sluce. Its Well Coards whip Coards are: not Coards to draw (Like Pully Coards) out of this Dungeons maw. Yet in the upper room of Paradise An Artist anvill'd out Reliefe sure, Good, A Golden Coarde, and bucket of Grace Choice Let down top full of Covenantall blood. Which when it touches, oh! the happy Cry! The doores fly ope. Now's jayle's Deliverie. This is a Spring of Liquour, heavenly, Cleare. Its Streams oreflow these banks. Its boundless Grace Whose Spring head's Godhead, and its Channells where It runs, is Manhood veans that Christ keeps Chase For it, and when it makes a Springtide Flood This Pit is drown'd with Covenantall blood. And now the Prisoners sent out, do come Padling in their Canooes apace with joyes Along this blood red Sea, Where joyes do throng, And sayling in the Arke of Grace that flies Drove sweetly by Gailes of the Holy Ghost Who sweetly briezes all along this Coast. Here's Covenant blood, indeed: and 't down the banks Of this dry Pit breakes: Also 'tis a key T'unlock the Shackles Sin hung on their Shanks And wash the durt off: send them cleane away. The Pris'ners freed, do on this Red Sea swim In Zions Barke: and in their Cabbins sing. Lord let this Covenantall blood send mee Poore Prisner, out of Sins dry Dungeon pound. And on this Red Sea saile mee safe to thee In which none Israelite was ever drown'd. My Sayles shall tune thee praise along this coast If waft with Gailes breath'd by the Holy Ghost. 79. Meditation.

Had I Promethius' filching Ferula Filld with its sacred theft the stoln Fire: To animate my Fancy lodg'd in clay, Pandora's Box would peps the theft with ire. But if thy Love, My Lord, shall animate My Clay with holy fire, 'twill flame in State. Fables fain'd Wonders do relate so strange That do amuse when heard. But oh! thy Fame Pend by the Holy Ghost, (and ne'er shall Change Nor vary from the truth) is wonders flame Glazde o're with Heavens Embelishments, and fan'd From evry Chaff, Dust, Weedy Seed, or Sand. What wilt thou change thyselfe for me, and take In lew thereof my sorry selfe; whereby, I am no more mine own, but thine, probate, Thou not so thine, as not mine too thereby? Dost purchase me to be thine own, thyselfe And be'st exchange for mee, thyselfe, and wealth? I'm Thine, Thou Mine! Mutuall propriety: Thou giv'st thyselfe. And for this gift takst mee To be thine own. I give myselfe (poore toy) And take thee for myne own, and so to bee. Thou giv'st thyselfe, yet dost thyselfe possess, I give and keep myselfe too neretheless. Both gi'n away and yet retain'd aright. Oh! Strange! I have thee mine, who hast thyselfe, Yet in possession Thou hast mee as tite, Who still enjoy myselfe, and thee my wealth. What strang appropriations hence arise? Thy Person mine, Mine thine, even weddenwise? Thine mine, mine Thine, a mutuall claim is made. Mine, thine are Predicates unto us both. But oh! the Odds in th'purchase price down laid: Thyselfe's thy Price, myselfe my mony go'th. Thy Purchase mony's infinitly high; Of Value for me: mine for thee, 's a toy. Thou'rt Heir of Glory, dost Bright image stand Ev'n of the God of Glory. Ownest all. Hast all Wealth Wisdom Glory, Might at hand And all what e're can to mans Glory fall. And yet thou givst thyselfe to purchase mee Ev'n of myselfe, to give myselfe to thee. And what am I? a little bit of Clay. Not more, nor better thing at all I give. (Though give myselfe) to thee as Purchase pay. For thee, and for thy all, that I may live. What hard terms art thou held unto by me. Both in thy Sale, and Purchase, laid on thee? But yet this thing doth not impov'rish thee Although thou payest down thy glorious selfe. And my down laying of myselfe I see For thee,'s the way for mee to blessed wealth. Thou freely givst what I buy Cheape of thee. I freely give what thou buyst deare of mee. The Purchasd Gift, and Given Purchase here (For they're both Gifts, and Purchases) by each For each, make each to one anothers deare, And each delight t'heare one anothers Speech. Oh! Happy Purchase. And oh! Happy Sale: Making each others joye in joyous gales. Let this dash out the snarling teeth that grin, Of that Damnd Heresy, calld sherlosism, That mocks, and scoffs the union (that blesst thing) To Christs Blesst Person, Happy Enkentrism. For if thats true, Christs Spouse spake false in this Saying My Beloved's Mine, and I am his. Hence, Oh! my Lord, make thou mee thine that so I may be bed wherein thy Love shall ly, And be thou mine that thou mayst ever show Thyselfe the Bed my Love its lodge may spy. Then this shall be the burden of my Song My Well belov'de is mine: I'm his become. 80. Meditation. Joh. 6.53.

This Curious pearle, One Syllable, call'd LIFE, That all things struggle t'keep, and we so prize I'd with the Edge of sharpen'd sight (as knife) My understanding sheath'th anatomize But finde Life far too fine, I can not know't. My sight too Dull; my knife's too blunt to do't. And if you say, What then is Life? I say I cannot tell you what it is, yet know That Various kinds of Life lodg in my clay. And ery kinde an Excellence doth show: And yet the lowest sort so secret lies I cannot finde it nor anatomize. But here I finde, that all these kindes proove Stares Whereon I do ascende to heaven to, My Lord, thyselfe, and so do mock earths Snares Those snick snarls, and thus my Soul Steps goe From Vegetate to Sensitive thence trace To Rationall, and thence to th'Life of Grace. What though I know not what it is? I know, It is too good to bee full known by any Poor Perblinde man, that squints on things, although It's Life, its quickening Life to very many, Yea t'all th'Elect. It is a slip up bred Of Godlike life, in graces garden bed. Grace is the Pearle, the Mother Pearle of Pearles In which this Pearle of Life is kirnell choice. Christ dropt it in the Soule, which up it ferles A Lignum Vitae's chip of Paradise. Its Heart and Soule of Saving Grace outspred And can't be had till Grace be brought to bed. The Soule's the Womb. Christ is the Spermodote And Saving Grace the seed cast thereinto, This Life's the principall in Graces Coate, Making vitality in all things flow, In Heavenly verdure brisking holily With sharp ey'de peartness of Vivacity. Dead Looks, and Wanness, all things on them weare, If this Life Quickens not, Things Spirituall Dead. The Image too of God is grown thrid bare If this Choice Life be n't with Christ's body fed. All other lives dance on, in hellish wayes Eternally, unless this Life out blaze. Thou art, my Lord, the Well-spring of this life. Oh! let this Life send Rivelets in my heart. That I may by lifes streames in Holy Strife Conquour that death, at whose dead Looks I start. When of this Life my soule with Child doth spring The Babe of Life swath'de up in Grace shall sing. 81. Meditation. Joh. 6.53. unless ye eat the Flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, you have no life in you. 2.3m [May] 1708. I fain would praise thee, Lord, but often finde Some toy or trinket slipping in between My heart and thee, that whiffles hence my minde From this I know not how, and oft unseen. That such should interpose between my Soule And thee, is matter for mee to Condole. I finde thou art the Spring of Life, and Life Is up Empon'd in thee, that's Life indeed. Thou art Lifes Fountain and its Food. The Strife Of Living things doth for Life Sake proceed. But he that with the best of Lifes is spic'te Doth eate, and drinke the Flesh, and blood of Christ. What feed on Humane Flesh and Blood? Strang mess! Nature exclaims. What Barbarousness is here? And Lines Divine this sort of Food repress. Christs Flesh and Blood how can they bee good Cheer? If shread to atoms, would too few be known, For ev'ry mouth to have a single one? This Sense of this blesst Phrase is nonsense thus. Some other Sense makes this a metaphor. This feeding signifies, that Faith in us Feeds on this fare, Disht in this Pottinger. Faith feeds upon this Heavenly Manna rare And drinkes this Blood. Sweet junkets: Angells Fare. Christs works, as Divine Cookery, knead in The Pasty Past, (his Flesh and Blood) most fine Into Rich Fare, made with the rowling pin His Deity did use. (Obedience prime) Active, and Passive is the Food that all That have this Life feed on within thy Hall. Here's Meate, and Drinke for Souls to use: (Good Cheer,) Cookt up, and Brewd by Pure Divinity The juyce tund up in Humane Casks that ne'er Were musty made by any Sluttery. And tapt by Graces hand whose table hold This fare in Dishes far more rich than Gold. Thou, Lord, Envit'st me thus to eat thy Flesh, And drinke thy blood more Spiritfull than wine. And if I feed not here on this rich mess, I have no life in mee: no life Divine. The Spirituall Life, the Life of God, and Grace Eternall Life, obtain in me no place. The Naturall Life the Life of Reason too Are but as painten Cloths to that I lack The Spirituall Life, and Life Eternall View. If none of mine, my Glorys face grows black. And how should I upon this food ere feed, If thou give unto me no vitall Seed? Those Fruits (the Works) that gloriously do shine Upon thy Humane Nature Flesh and Blood From thy Divine, are th'Purchase price, and th'Fine Set on our heads, and made our Spirituall Food. Faith thats the feeding on these pleasant flowers, Incorporates thy Flesh and Blood with ours. Thy Flesh, and Blood and Office Fruites shall bee My Souls Plumb Cake it eates, as naturally, In Spirituall wise mixt with my soul, as wee Finde food doth with the body properly. So that my life shall be mentain'd and thrive Eternally when Spiritually alive. Oh! feed mee, Lord, on thy rich Florendine. Made of the Fruites which thy Divinity As Principall did beare, (more sweet than wine) Upon thy Manhood, meritoriously. If I be fed with this rich fare, I will Say Grace to thee with Songs of holy Skill. 82. Meditation. Joh. 6.53. Unless yee eate the Flesh of the Son of Man, and drinke his blood, ye have no life. 27.4m [June] 1708. My tatter'd Fancy; and my Ragged Rymes Teeme leaden Metaphors: which yet might serve To hum a little touching terrene Shines. But Spirtuall Life doth better fare deserve. This thought on, sets my heart upon the Rack. I fain would have this Life but han't its knack. Reason stands for it, moving to persue't. But Flesh and Blood, are Elementall things. That sink me down, dulling my Spirits fruit. Life Animall a Spirituall Sparke ne'er springs. But if thy Altars Coale Enfire my heart, With this Blesst Life my Soule will be thy Sparke. I'm Common matter: Lord thine Altar make mee. Then sanctify thine Altar with thy blood: I'l offer on't my heart to thee. (Oh! take mee) And let thy fire Calcine mine Altars Wood, Then let thy Spirits breath, as Bellows, blow That this new kindled Life may flame and glow. Some Life with Spoon, or Trencher do mentain Or suck its food through a Small Quill, or Straw: But make me, Lord, this Life thou givst, sustain With thy Sweet Flesh, and Blood, by Gospell Law. Feed it on Zions Pasty Plate-Delights: I'de suck it from her Candlesticks Sweet Pipes. Need makes the Old wife trot: Necessity Saith, I must eate this Flesh, and drinke this blood. If not, no Life's in mee that's worth a Fly, This mortall Life, while here eats mortall Foode. That sends out influences to mentaine, A little while, and then holds back the same. But Soule Sweet Bread, is in Gods Back house, made On Heavens high Dresser Boarde and throughly bakd: On Zions Gridiron, sapt in'ts dripping trade, That all do live that on it do partake, Its Flesh, and Blood even of the Deity; None that do eat, and Drinke, it, ever dy. Have I a vitall Sparke even of this Fire? How Dull am I? Lord let thy Spirit blow Upon my Coale, untill its heart is higher, And I be quickned by the same, and Glow. Here's Manna Angells food to fatten them. That I must eate or be a witherd stem. Lord, make my Faith thy golden Quill where through I vitall Spirits from thy blood may suck. Make Faith my Grinders, thy Choice Flesh to chew, My Witherd Stock shall with frim Fruits be stuck. My Soule shall then in Lively Notes forth ring Upon her Virginalls, praise for this thing. 83. Meditation. Can. 5.1. I am come into my Garden, etc. 29.6m [Aug.] 1708. A Garden, yea a Paradise indeed, Of all Delightfull Beauteous flowers and sweet, (A Cloud of rich perfume hence did proceed From sweet breathd plants,) first Adam was to keep. But sinning here he's from this Farm exilde, And th'Farm, Lord, thou camst to, 's a Garden stylde A Garden-Church, set with Choice Herbs and Flowers. Here Lign-Aloes. And th'Tree of Life. Here trees of Frankincense and Myrrh up towers. Here's Sharons Rose and Lillie: Beauties Strife. Here's Cassia, Cinnamon, Cloves, Nut Megs, Mace. Sweet Calamus: and all Heavens herbs of Grace. Here's Order Choice, Beds, Allies all in print. Here bud sweet blushing Blossoms, sparkling brave And Beautifull rich, spangled Flowers bepinckt Which White, Red, Blushie, Cherry Cheek't Smiles have, Making Celestiall aire their Civit Box Of Aromatick Vapors: Spirituall Drops. This Garden, Lord, thy Church, this Paradise Thou comst into, with thy Choice Spirits Gales Making all Plants of Grace gust out like Spice Their sweet perfumed breath that us assailes. And sacrifice their Spirits sweet upon Their Beauties Altar to thee, Holy One. This Garden too's the Soule, of thy Redeem'd: When thou thy Spirits plants therein hast set In their Conversion now most Choicely 'steemd Embeautified with Graces bracelet. If that my Soule thy Paradise once bee: Thou wilt emparadise it e're with thee. Make mee thy Garden; Lord, thy Grace my plant: Make mee thy Vineyard, and my plants thy Vine: Then come into thy Garden: View each ranck: And make my Grape bleed in thy Cup rich wine. When thou comest in, My Garden flowers will smile And blossom Aromatick Praise the while. 84. Meditation. Can. 5.1. I have gatherd my Myrrh with my Spice. 17.8m [Oct.] 1708. Hast made mee, Lord, one of thy Garden Beds? And myrrhiz'd mee with bitter Exercise? Stubd up the Brush, toore up the Turfy head? And Combt it with thy Harrow teeth likewise? Hast set therein thy Myrrhy Trees, that so Sweet Spice might in this Garden bed forth flow? This Bitter myrrh will keep Corruption out Will kill the Worms that Worm hole do my heart: Will breath sweet breath of rich perfumes about, That sweetest Sents though bitter tast impart. Such med'cine, Lord, I lack my Sin to calm, To kill Corruption and my Soule Embalm. But doth thy Myrrh tree Flowrish in my Soule? Doth it bleed Myrrh, and Myrrhy blossoms beare? Do thy Convictions bring mee to Condole My Sinfulness with griefe, Hearts bitter fare? And pickle up my Soule in teares whereby My Sins are mortifi'de repentingly? Is this the State, Lord, of my Garden Bed? And com'st thou in thy Garden, Lord, anew? And gatherst thou thy Myrrh that's therein bred With thy Sweet Spices? Oh! this matter shew. Thy bitter Myrrh that then my Sins doth quell, Will mee revive with its sweet gracious Smell. How graciously then dost thou deale with mee, Wrapping this bitter myrrh in Odours sweet? Tho'ts bitter rellish yet sweet sented wee Do finde it: when our Senses do it greet. Its bitter kills the Vermin in my Hive: The Sweetness makes my inward man revive. This myrrh in killing putrid vermin Sins, Will keep my Soule from putrifying here, Will ease the Conscience of its dreadfull Stings: And sweeten all with its perfumed Cheere. Thou art delighted in this Myrrh For Why? Thou dost it gather with thy Spice, oh! Joy. Then spice my Soule, Lord, with sweet myrrh that drops Off of my Myrrh tree in thy garden Bed. Thou gatherdst with thy Spice, this garden Crops Thy Garden bore thee. Oh! Choice Crop it bred. Apply this Myrrh on me, and on mee keep't. My Soules Cure lies indeed in Bitter-Sweet. If with thy Myrrh, thou curs't my mallody Which hitherto hinders my Songs of Praise And with its spicy gales that from it fly, Thou dost perfume my Spirits, Songs to raise. My Spirits stufft with sweetest joy will bring Thy Glory tun'de on my perfumed String. 85. Meditation. Can. 5.1. I have eate my Hony Come with my Hony. I have drunk my Wine with my Milk. 26.10m [Dec.] 1708. Oh! Angells, stand agastard at my Song; The Aire scarce e're sedans such news as this. The Soule Christs Spouse his garden Bed's become Where Christ doth walk in Aromatick bliss. Sin slaying Grace he gets as Myrrh and Spice. Grace Nutritive's his Wine, Milk, Hony Choice. Repentance, Patience, and Humility And Graces such that mortify our Sin Thou gatherst up as garden fruits with joy, Thy bitter Myrrh and Sweet Spice note this thing. The Exercising of these graces Choice, Perfume thy Ambient aire with Holy Spice. Faith, Hope, and Love with Heavenizing Joy. These graces Nutritive to Souls arise As Honey in its Comb, deliciously Unto thy Palate in their Exercise Thou in the Garden eats as Hony Good, And drinkst as wine and milk, sweet Sillibub. Hast set these Slips, Lord, of the Holy Ghost In me thy gardens bed? Do they grow there And bear thee spirituall fruits the which thou dost Delight thy Palate with, as Choicest Cheere? Oh! Do these graces that thou sets in mee Thy Hony, Wine, and Milk Cook up for thee? Who could believe it, if thou hadst not said I'm come into my Garden, in its Shine Have got my myrrh with Spice up. (Oh! sweet trade) My Hony ate and drunk with milk my Wine? Hast Eate and drunk my Holy Fair and Good? Hony ints Comb, and Winemilk Sillibub? What thing is this? How sweet? How Good? How brave? Oh! Leape my Soule for joy: art thou become A Spice bed in Christ's Garden where each Wave Of spiced aire brieze all his Walks along: Oh! dress thy Garden, Lord; it fatten well That I its bed may with such Fruits excell. Be thou my Gardener, Lord, make my Soule Thy Gardens Knot. Thy Grace my plants set there. And make my fruits, thy Myrrh and Spice out rowle, My Hope, Faith, Charity, thy Chiefe good cheere. Then Hony, Wine, and Milk Well Spic'de by mee Shall disht with Praise, thy entertainment bee. 86. Meditation. Can. 5.1. Eat Oh! Friends. Drink, yea drink abundantly Oh! Beloved. 21.12m [Feb.] 1708. Sometimes, my Lord, while that my Soule enwarms Heroicks to thy Violl, I did finde My heart enchanted with thy Ambient Charms, That like an Angell, agitate my minde, Soaring't as on seraphick wings on high. But now, like lead, I Cold, and Heavy lie. Lord, touch it with thine Altars quick, live Coale, And then my Spirits, (oh! how brisk? How Quick?) Will sweetest melody upon thee rowle. Their Tunes shall with thy praises frisk and skip. When on thy Sillibubb I sup and bib, Thy wine and milk will make my Notes run glib. But is it thus? Do graces blossoms grow As Myrrh? And Spice? Hony? And Hony Comb? Yea Wine, and Milk, which as they overflow? For thee, thou eatst, and drinkst, and sayst come come Furnish my Table with the same I'l cry Eat here my Friends, drink, drinke abundantly? Wilt thou me spice with spice that spiceth thee? Shall I eat of the Hony Comb thou eatst? Shall I drinke of the Cup thou drinkst of? See! Drink of thy Wine and Milk! eat of thy meats? What Love? What Honour? Shall I have such share And hearty welcome of thy Trencher fare? Oh that the Quintessence, Lord, of mee here In the pure Spirits then of Zions Wine Extracted were all into Praise most cleare I'd raise to thee Up Praise. Id all be thine. Could I refine myselfe thus melt to praise All should be thine on this account, and blaze. Then make mee, Lord, one of thy garden beds The Herb of Trinity set in my Heart. Herb True Love. Herb of Grace with Rosie Sheds, Which springing up may beauties sweet impart. Then I shall yield thee Hony, Milk and Wine: And Spice too, sweet to thee, and t'sweeten thine. Mee gracious make, then Graces fruits I'st beare. Which thou, Lord, callst thy Myrrh, thy Spice and Milk Thy Wine thy Hony too, of which a Share To mee to wonderment, impart thou wilt. Eate at thy Table, and drinke too shall I? Then o're this Feast, I will say grace for joy. 87. Meditation. Joh. 10.10. I am come that they might have Life. 17.2m [Apr.] 1709. Life! Life! What's That? It is a Taske too hard For my Goose Quill with 'Bellisht Definitions To set it out: It would thereby be marrd: My inke would black it, though a gold Edition. Its Natures Principall, that makes all brisk, Peart, Flowerish, Glorious where it consists. Its such a Thing that makes all things in which It doth embower, and while they're with it fraught To be full Worthy, Beautifull and Rich While in them. But when Gone, they're good for naught. Where ere it is, its th'chiefest excellence: And where it is not, is no Worth, nor Sense. Its such a thing, that all things else attende. Earths Golden Fleece, and Flourish, Fruits, and Flower Of ery sort, their sweet Consent do sende, To Honour, and mentain it in its Tower. Heaven smiles on't and in 'ts Crystall Candle Stick Stand Sun, Moon, Stars blazing to Lighten it. It from the Worlds Birth runs unto its End Along Lifes Channells of each sort of things And all their peart Eyde beauty doth them send. What of all worldly Glory is the Spring, Whose brightest Flower of all this Beauty bright Is Humane Life. Oh! a most beautious sight. This Life adepts mans Person to be made All Glorious with shining Grace indeed, And in this glory in Gods Holy trade Of Grace unto his Glory to proceed. But oh! Sin fould this Glory: Man hath lost it: Death by a Sinfull Morsell killd and crost it. But oh! what Grace, my Blessed Lord, hast thou? What vallue sets't thou on mans life, now vile? Prize it thou dost 'bove all the world, that Now To save't from Death, thou leapest ore the Stile, Dy'dst in our Stead, that wee might still have Life Appeasing Justice, Ending thereby Strife. But oh! how precious is this Life of Man, Seing thou cam'st from heaven for this end That we might live, Do Satan what he can, Myselfe to thee, my Lord, I therefore give. Give me, Lord, Life and Grace to boot then I Will give My Life and Selfe to thee with Joy. 89. Meditation. Joh. 10.10. I am come that they might have Life. 12.4m [June] 1709. What Birth of Wonders from thy Fingers ends Dropt, when the World, Lord, dropt out of the Womb Of its Non-Entity for to attende Thy Will its Cradle. And its Midwife Strong. Non-Entity in Travail full did bare The World, big belli'd with all Wonders rare. The Infant born, in'ts Cradle dorment lay, As Dead, yet Capable of Ery Form. A jumbled Lump of all things ery Way Not any single birth of its yet born, But when this Lump einjoy'd a Vitall Heate All Kinds of things did from its belly leape. Life Vegetative now hatcht in the Egge, Flourishing some things nobler than the rest. Life sensitive gives some of these its Head, Inspiring them with honour next the best. And some of which Life Rationall Enfires, Cloathd with a Spiritualizing Life, aspires. This Life thy Fingers freely dropt into The Humane shaped Elements and made The same Excell the Rest and nobler goe Enspirited with Heavenizing trade. But man by Sin hath lost all life, and marr'd Himselfe eternally. Death's his reward. But thou my Lord, before its Execution Didst Step from heaven down Death to deterr And that we might have life: making Solution Unto the Creditor, dost Grace Conferr, Oh! what a thing is life then. Choice? how Good, In that thou camst to buy it with thy blood? Life Naturall indeed is in the Bill Thou with thy Father drewst up, it to buy. Life Spirituall much more; which ever Will As Heaven doth Earth, all Naturall Life out Vie. Life Naturall is Common makes to live Things Vegetative, and things Sensitive. The Spirituall Life is never founde but where Life Naturall indeed doth make its nest, Which builds as well in Bruits and Wicked geers As in God's Children, and in holy breasts. But Spirituall Life falls onely to Gods Sons And Out in Holy Conversation runs. It doth Saints Souls and Conversation gild With Godlike Glory of a Gracious Shine Brightens its Superstructure where it builds A Lofty Tower of Holy Life Divine. The Richest Jewell in the Cabinet Of Nature made, this Spirituall Life is set. The Spirituall Life is nighst Gods Life in kinde. In Godlike Properties it doth Consist. Hence't glorifies the Soule and Life with it lin'de. Lord, in my Soul and Life this life entwist. Thou cam'st that I might live thus. Then grant me This Life. And I shall Glory beare for thee. 90. Meditation. Joh. 10.28. I give unto them Eternal Life. 14.6m [Aug.] 1709. Eternal Life! What Life is this, I pray? Eternity snick snarls my Brains, thought on: Its the Arithimaticians Wrack each way. It hath begining, yet it end hath none. He that hath been ten thousand years therein, 'S as far from 'ts end, as when they did begin. Eternity indeed is Adjunct to The Life of Man. Of all men Good, and Bad. As to Deaths Darksom Entery they goe They e're shall live and joyous be, or sad. Eternall life, then is dicotamizd Into a Life of Joy or miseries. This last is Calld Everlasting Punishment Or Everlasting sad Distruction, Or second Death. Not Life. Its Life all shent Of Good, and filld with Deaths Edition. This though the Worms alive, is Living Death, A thousand times worse than to have no breath. Eternall Life then's in a right Sense this. That All things blissfull do to it belong Life Naturall, and Spirituall Life's in bliss Eternizde in Eternall Joyes that throng. Though all by Nature Death indeed doth fine. Yet, Lord, thou giv'st Eternall Life to thine. Oh! what a Lord is mine? How rich? that he Gives his, Eternall Life: that doth Contain All Heaven and its Glory, Bliss, and Glee Within it, Hee is Rightfull Lord of th'Same. For none can give that which he never had: Wheather that gift he gives be good, or bad. And though he give this Gift so rich to his His Wealth and Glory's not thereby Diminisht. He hath the Spring of Life, and Life of bliss. When they their Pilgrimage have fully finisht, Out of His Spring of life and Bliss that flowth, Confer Eternall Life on them he doth. Life Naturall (although Essentiall to All Living things) and Spirituall Life indeed, Peculiar to Rationalls also Containd are in Christs Gift as in a Seed, Are both Adjuncted with Eternity In that he gives them them Eternally. Ripe Grace in all its Orient Blossoms bright Ripe Glory in its flower of brightest Shine, Ripe joy upon the highest branch full ripe Are in this Life Eternall made most fine, All blanched o're in orient Glory all Do send their Shining Rayes on them to fall. Oh! Boundless Sea, and Bottomless of Love, Confer'd on Saints. Oh! richest gift ere gi'n! Worth more than thousands Worlds: all Heaven above, Whole Heavens of Love; and God to boot therein: God, Bliss, Joy, Glory, Eternal Life enjoy'de Oh! Happiness! Saints Happy shall abide. Hence, Lord, I kiss thy Feet, and humbly Cry Give mee this Gift, Eternall Life I pray. 'Twill gild my Harp O're very gloriously, And spiritualize my Strings thy tunes to play. Life Naturall's the Base: the Spirituall is The Meane: the Tenour is Eternall Bliss. Lord, make my Person, subject of thy Gift Eternal Life its Adjunct gi'n by thee. My Person then, thy Well-Tun'de Harp shall lift Thy Praises up in Tunes sung forth by mee. Then on my Spirituall Wiars harmoniously Thy Sweetest Tunes shall ring Eternall Joy. 91. Meditation. Matth. 24.27. So also shall the coming of the Son of Man be. 2.8m [Oct.] 1709. What once again, My Lord, allowst thou mee, Ev'n Mee, poore Dusty thing, thus to enjoy, With Thee, ev'n thee, 'fore whom, 't's said, Bow the Knee Ye Angells bright, Communion Graceously? Thou art so glorious, thy Very Feet Its glory to the Angells bright to greet. And shall I on thy Table Fare, Lord, feed, That is Cookt up by much more Whiter hands Than ever Angells usd? Thy flesh indeed Is meate, and Blood is Drink and on it stands. The Waiters are bright Angells all in Shine Of their White, Holy, Sapphick Robes Divine. The thoughts hereof entring upon my Heart Nigh sink, and drown my fainty Soule ev'n in The Ocean Sea of Flaming Joy best part. As she attempts Magnificat to sing And plunging down and up herein, oft Cries, As she pops up her head, Raptures of Joyes. And now, my Lord, me with thy foode sustain: Mee in good liking make, yea Fat, and fine, To wait on thee when thou hast come again: For Come thou wilt, and kindely visit thine. Thou lov'dst our Nature that its blossoms hang In thy Description. Hence the Son of Man. Thou art Continually a Comming, its true, In Providences Some, that scowle and lower, That Thunder sharp and fiery lightening spew. Yet Roses Some, and Mary golds out shower. Thou comst in Ordinances too: and dost The golden gifts give of the Holy Ghost. But still, besides this, there's another which Our text Embellisheth in glory bright. Part of thy Exaltations Glory rich When thou comst with all Angells train of Light. Then by thy present Comings furnish mee That I when thou shalt come, may wait on thee. Hence loade my Trencher with thy Flesh Divine: Its Angells foode. My Soule doth almost sink: And press thy Grape into my Cup: Rich Wine. Lord make thy Blood indeed, my dayly drinke. When with thy Fare my Vessels fill to th'brim, Thy Praise, on my Shoshannims, Lord, shall Ring. 92. Meditation. Math. 24.27. So also shall the Coming of the Son of Man be. 27.9m [Nov.] 1709. It grieves mee, Lord, my Fancy's rusty: rub And brighten't on an Angells Rubston sharp. Furbish it with thy Spirits File: and dub It with a live Coale of thine Altars Spark. Yea, with thy holly Oyle make thou it slick Till like a Flash of Lightning, it grow Quick. My Heart may ake to finde so bright a Theme Which brighten might even Angels wits, to bee, By my thick, Rusty Fancy and dull Veane Barbd of its brightsom sparkling Shine by mee. Quicken my Fancy Lord; and mend my Pen: To Flowerish up the same, as brightest Gem. What is thy Humane Coach thy Soule rides in, Bathing in Bright, Heart ravishing glory all In Gods Celestiall splendent Palace trim, Full of it's Fulgient Glory of that hall? And wilt thou from this glorious Palace come Again to us on earth, where Sinners throng? Methinks I see, when thou appearest thus, The Clouds to rend, and Skies their Crystall Doore Open like thunder for thy pass to us And thy Bright Body deckt with Shine all Ore Flash through the Same like rapid Lightening Waver That gilds the Clouds, and makes the Heavens Quaver. Proud Sinners now that ore Gods Children crow Would if they could creep into Augur holes, Thy Lightening Flashing in their faces so, Melts down their Courage, terrifies their Souls. Thy Rapid Lightning Flashes pierce like darts Of Red hot fiery arrows through their hearts. Now Glory to the Righteous is the Song. Their dusty Frame drops off its drossiness Puts on bright robes, doth jump for joy, doth run To meet thee in the Clouds in lightning Dress. Whose nimble Flashes dancing on each thing While Angells trumpet-musick makes them sing. Make Sanctifying Grace, my tapestry, My person make thy Lookinglass Lord, clear And in my Looking Glass cast thou thine Eye. Thy Image view that standeth shining there. Then as thou com'st like Light'ning, I shall rise In Glories Dress to meet thee in the Skies. 93. Meditation. Joh. 14.2. In my Fathers house are many Mansions. 22.11m [Jan.] 1709. Could but a Glance of that bright City fair, Whose walls are sparkling, Pretious Stones, whose Gates Bright pollisht Splendent Pearls, Whose Porters are Swash Flaming Angells, and Whose Streets rich Plates Of pure transparent Gold, mine Eyes enjoy, My Ravisht heart on Raptures Wings would fly. My Lumpish Soule, enfir'd with such bright flame And Quick'ning influences of this Sight Darting themselves throughout my drossy frame Would jump for joy, and sing with greate delight To thee, my Lord, who deckst thy Royall Hall, With glorious Mansions for thy Saints even all. Thy Lower House, this World well garnished With richest Furniture of Ev'ry kinde Of Creatures of each Colours varnished Most glorious, a Silver Box of Winde. The Crystall Skies pinkt with Sun, Moon, and Stars Are made its Battlements on azure Spars. But on these Battlements above, thoust placdst Thy Upper House, that Royall Palace town, In which these Mansions are, that made thou hast For Saints and Angells Dwellings of renown. Should we suppose these mansions, Chambers neate Like ours, 't would sordid be, not fit this Seate. But if these Mansions, built so very bright Beyond the worlds Bright Battlements, yet should Be of materialls Celestiall right Streets of such Houses, of transparent gold For Saints and Angells to possess in Glory's Would they unfit thy Upper House as Stories. Though we can't ken these Mansions, now, yet this Our Faith doth dwell upon while on this Shore That there are Mansions, in Celestiall Bliss For Saints and Angells t'dwell in evermore. Then cheer up, Soule, and take the Kings path brave Unto these Mansions promises do pave. Bright Jasper Hall Walld with translucid gold, Floors pav'd with Pearls, to these are durty Sells. Then what bright lives ought all men here uphold That hope within these mansions ere to dwell? Adorne my Soule, Lord, with thy Graces here Till by their Shine, I'm fitted to dwell there. Let as I bring thy Glory home, in mee Grace shine, and me thy paths tread pav'de with jems, Unto thy house, wherein these Mansions bee, And let mee dwell within their Curtain Hems. Thy Praise shall then my Virginalls inspire To play a Michtam on her golden wyer. 94. Meditation. Joh. 14.2. In my Fathers House are Many Mansions. 19.1m [Mar.] 1709/10. Celestiall Mansions! Wonder, oh my Soul! Angells Pavillions surely: and no Halls For Mud walld Matter, wherein Vermins rowle, Worm eaten'd ore with Sin, like wormhold Walls. Shall Earthen Pitchers set be on the Shelfe Of such blesst Mansions Heavenly Plate of Wealth? May I presume to screw a single thought Well splic'de with Saving Faith, into my Heart, That my poore Potshread, all o're good for nought May ever in these Lodgens have a part The influences of the Same would fly With rapid flashes through my heart of joy. Oh! that thy Spirit would my Soule Inlay With such rich lining, Graces Web, that would While in my Loom, me in these Tents convay, And that thy Sovereign Love might ever hold Me in the paths that to these Mansions bring, That I might ever dwell with thee therein. Oh! that my Meditations all were frindg'd With Sanctifying Gifts: and all my wayes Borderd were with Obedience rightly hindg'd Lord on thy word thy Honour bright to raise. Oh! that my Paths were pavde with Holiness And that thy Glory were their shining dress. Array me, Lord, with such rich robes all ore As for their Matter, and their modes usd are Within these Mansions. Dye them all therefore Deep in thy blood: to make them gracious Ware. If with thy precious robes will't dress me here My present tunes shall sing thy praise when there. 95. Meditation. Joh. 14.2. I go to prepare a place for you. 14.3m [May] 1710. What shall a Mote up to a Monarch rise? An Emmet match an Emperor in might? If Princes make their personall Exercise Betriming mouse holes, painting with delight! Or hanging Hornets nests with rich attire All that pretende to Wisdome would admire. The Highest Office and Highst Officer Expende on lowest intrest in the world The greatest Cost and wealthiest treasure far Twould shew mans wisdom's up in folly furld. That Humane Wisdom's hatcht within the nest Of addle brains which wisdom ne'er possesst. But blush, poor Soule, at th'thought of such a thought Touching my Lord, the King of Kings most bright As acting thus, for us all over nought, Worse than poor Ants, or Spider catchers mite Who goes away t'prepare's a place most cleare Whose Shine o're shines the shining Sunshine here. Ye Heavens wonder, shall your maker come To Crumbs of Clay, bing'd all and drencht in Sin To stop the gap with Graces boughs, defray The Cost the Law transgresst, doth on us bring? Thy head layst down under the axe on th'block That for our Sins did off the same there lop: But that's not all. Thou now didst sweep Death's Cave Clean with thy hand: and leavest not a dust Of Flesh, or Bone that there th'Elect dropt have, But bringst out all, new buildst the Fabrick just, (Having the Scrowle of Gods Displeasure clear'd) Bringst back the Soule putst in its tent new rear'd. But thats not all: Now from Deaths realm, erect, Thou gloriously gost to thy Fathers Hall: And pleadst their Case preparst them place well dect All with thy Merits hung. Blesst Mansions all. Dost ope the Doore lockt fast 'gainst Sins that so These Holy Rooms admit them may thereto. But thats not all. Leaving these dolefull roomes Thou com'st and takst them by the hands, Most High, Dost them translate out from their Death bed toombs, To th'rooms prepar'd filld with Eternall joy. Them Crownst and thronst there, there their lips be shall Pearld with Eternall Praises that's but all. Lord Let me bee one of these Crumbs of thine. And though Im dust adorn me with thy graces That though all flect with Sin, thy Grace may shine As thou Conductst me to these furnisht places. Make mee, thy Golden trumpet, sounded bee, By thy Good Spirits melody to thee. 96. Meditation. Cant. 1.2. Let him kiss me with the Kisse of his mouth. 9.5m [July] 1710. What placed in the Sun: and yet my ware, A Cloud upon my head? an Hoodwinke blinde? In middst of Love thou layst on mee, despare? And not a blinke of Sunshine in my minde? Shall Christ bestow his lovely Love on his, And mask his face? allowing not a kiss? Shall ardent love to Christ enfire the Heart? Shall hearty love in Christ embrace the Soule? And shall the Spirituall Eye be wholy dark, In th'heart of Love, as not belov'd, Condole? In th'midst of Loves bright Sun, and yet not see A Beame of Love allow'd to lighten thee? Lord! read the Riddle: Shall a gracious heart The object of thy love be sick of Love? And beg a kiss under the piercing Smart, Of want thereof? Lord pitty from above. What wear the Sun, without a ray of light? In midst of Sunshine, meet a pitchy night? Thy foes, whose Souls Sins bowling alley's grown With Cankering Envy rusty made, stand out Without all Sense of thy Sweet Love ere shown Is no great wonder. Thou lov'st not this rout. But wonder't is that such that grudge their hearts Hold love too little for thee, should thus smart. Nay, nay, stand Sir: here's wisdom very cleare. None sensibly can have thy love decline: That never had a drop thereof: nor ere Did tast thereof. This is the right of thine. Such as enjoy thy Love, may lack the Sense May have thy love and not loves evidence. Maybe thy measures are above thy might. Desires Crave more than thou canst hold by far: If thou shouldst have but what thou would, if right, Thy pipkin soon would run ore, breake, or jar. Wisdom allows enough: none t'wast is known. Because thou hast not all, say not, thoust none. Christ loves to lay thy Love under Constraint. He therefore lets not's Love her Candle light, To see her Lovely arms that never faint Circle thyself about, with greate Delight. The prayers of Love ascend in gracious tune To him as Musick, and as heart perfume. But listen, Soule, here seest thou not a Cheate. Earth is not heaven: Faith not Vision. No. To see the Love of Christ on thee Compleate Would make heavens Rivers of joy, earth overflow. This is the Vale of tears, not mount of joyes. Some Crystal drops while here may well suffice. But, oh my Lord! let mee lodge in thy Love. Although thy Love play bow-peep with me here. Though I be dark: want Spectacles to prove Thou lovest mee: I shall at last see Clear. And though not now, I then shall sing thy praise. In that thy love did tende me all my dayes. 97. Meditation. Can. 1.2. Let him kiss me with the Kisses of his mouth. 3.7m [Sept.] 1710. My onely Lord, when with no muddy Sight, Mine Eyes behold that ardent Flame of Love, Thy Spouse, when that her day Light seemed night In passionate affection seemd to move. When thou to her didst onely Cease to show Thy sweet love token: makes me cry out, Oh! Although in trying, I through grace can finde My heart holds such Conclusions in't, that I Account this World, Silver, and Gold, refinde Pearles, Pretious Stones, Riches, and Friends a toy. Methinks I could part with them all for thee Yet know not what I should if tri'de should bee. I dare not say, such ardent flames would rise Of true Loves passion, in its Blinks or Blisses, As in thy Holy Spouse's heart that cries Oh! let him kiss mee with his orall kisses. Should he but stop such acts of love and grace Making dark Clouds mask up his brightsom face. If such strong Flame of Love, be made the mark And Cata Pantos of true Love, then who Can prove his marriage knot to Christ in's heart That doth not finde such ardent flames oreflow? When thy bright Sun-Shine Face doth weare a Cloude Methinks my Soule in Sorrows thicket shroudes. Yet pardon, Lord, give me this word again: I feare to wrong myselfe, or Gracious thee. This I can say, and can this say mentain, If thou withdrawst, my heart soon sinks in mee. Though oftentimes my Spirits dulled, grow, If so I am, I am not alwayes soe: When thou dost shine, a Sunshine day I have: When I am cloudy then I finde not thee: When thou dost cloud thy face, thy Face I crave. The Shining of thy face enlivens mee. I live and dy as Smiles and Frowns take place: The Life, and Death of Joy Lodge in thy face. But yet methinks my pipkin is too small. It holds too little of Loves liquour in't. All that it holds for thee seems none at all. Thou art so dear, it is too cheape a Drink. If I had more thou shouldst have more of mee If Better, better too. I all give thee. If thou, my Lord, didst not accept a mite More than a mountain, if the mite doth hold More than a mountain of the heart Love right I should be blankt, my heart would grow so cold. A Quarter of a Farthen halfe a mite Of Love thou likest well, its heart delight. Then let thy Loveliness, Lord touch my heart. And let my heart imbrace thy loveliness: That my small mite of Love might on thee dart, And thy great selfe might my poor love possess. My little mite of Love shall musick sweet Tune forth on thee, its harp, that heaven shall greet. 98. Meditation. Can. 1.2. Thy Love is better than Wine. 29.8m [Oct.] 1710. A Vine, my Lord, a noble Vine indeed Whose juyce makes brisk my heart to sing thy Wine. I have read of the Vine of Sibmahs breed, And Wine of Hesbon, yea and Sodoms Vine, All which raise Clouds up when their Liquour's High In any one: but thine doth Clarify. The Choicest Vine, the royallst grape that rose, Or ere in Cana'ns Vinyard did take Root, Did Emblemize thy selfe the True Vine those Are not like thee for Nature, nor for fruite. Thy noble royall nature Ever blesst Produceth spiced juyce by far the best. The Vine deckt in her blosom frindge the Aire With sweet perfume. O! Smell of Lebanon! Her Grapes when pounded and presst hard (hard fare) Bleed out both blood and Spirits leaving none Which too much tooke, the brain doth too much tole, Tho't smacks the Palate, merry makes the Soule. But oh! my Lord, thou Zions Vine most deare, Didst send the Wealthi'st juyce and Spirits up to Thy Grape which prest in Zions Wine fat Geere Did yield the Welthi'st wine that ere did flow. Its Loves Rich liquour spice't with Grace even thine, And thus thy love is better far than wine. This Wine thy Love bleeds from thy grape, how sweet? To spiritualize the life in every part. How full of Spirits? And of a spirituall reech, To th' blood and Spirits of the gracious heart? How warming to the Chilly person grown? And Cordiall to spirituall feeble one? How sweet? how warm? how Cordiall is thy Love That bleeds thy grapes sweet Juyce into the Soule? How brings it Grace, and Heaven from above. And drops them in the Heart its Wassell bowle? Wine th'Nectar of all juyces with its sapor Compared to thy love is but a Vaper. Its not like other wine which took too much, Whose Spirits vapor. And do wise men foole. But this the more is tooke, the Better such Servants and Service best, best grace the Schoole. Lord tun this Wine in me and make my Savour Be ever richly filled with its flavour. Lord make mee Cask, and thy rich Love its Wine. Impregnate with its Spirits, Lord, my heart. And make its heat my heart and blood refine, And Sweetness sweeten me in ery part. Give me to drinke the juyce of this true Vine Then I will sing thy Love better than Wine. 99. Meditation. Isa. 24.23. He shall walk before his Ancient gloriously. 24.10m [Dec.] 1710. Glory! what art? O! Sparkling Spark all bright, Thy Shining Robes all gallantry do ware Dazling the Eye of such as have the Sight Of anyone deckt with thy Sparklings rare. Guilding the Ambient aire with golden shine In which its Subjects stande in glory fine. This pale-fac'de Moon that Silver Snowball like That Walkes ints Silver Glory, paints the Skies The tester of the Bed, where day and night Each Creature Coverd ore with glory lies, She with her Silver Rayes envarnish doth In Silver paint, the Skies as out she go'th. But oh! the Sun, that golden Ball of Glory That Walkes in his Celestiall Galleries In flaming Broad cloth wove, in th'Highest Story, Of Glories Rayes, and aires fine twine webwise Doth make her golden Beams, her tapestry Which gilds the heavens ore, hung out on high. But all this glory pleasent to behold, Is but a drop of ink compar'd with thine, My Deare-Dear Lord whose Sparkling glory would Enravish all that sees but halfe its Shine. The bodies eyes want Strength to beare the Sight From sinking when a beam of't on't doth Light. Thy elementall Frame, that China Dish, Varnisht with nature's rich perfection o're, The top of beauty, humane nature's bliss, Most naturally deckt with all beauties glore, A Crystall Glass, Transparent Silver bowle. Or Golden Tabernacle of the Soule. Eyes ne'er beheld Humanity so brave, So Beautifull a piece of manhood-frame. Filld all with graces glory, whose bright Wave Is dasht all ore, with orientall flame. A Golden Viol full of gracious Grace Whose flashing Shine out shines the Angells face. Hence ery thought that in thy heart was hatcht. And ery word that from thy lips did fall And ery act thy person ere dispatcht, Came glorifide with graces glory all That eyes enlighten'd with thy glory, said We saw his glory as God's Son's, displaid. When thou the Curtain backtst a little t'shew A little flash of thy greate glory bright Thy Countenance did shine like lightning: true, Thy Raiment was as white as Snow, or light. Angells adore and Saints admire thy brightness And hunger to bee filled with thy likeness. Lord, make me with thy likeness like to thee. Upon my Soule thy Shining Image place. And let thy glorious grace shine bright in mee. Enlay my thoughts, my words, and Works with Grace. If thou wilt dub mee with bright gracious geere, I'le sing thee Songs of Grace in Glories Spheare. 100. Meditation. Isai. 24.23. The Lord of Hosts shall reign in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem and before his Ancients gloriously. 18.12m [Feb.] 1710. Glory, What art thou? tell us: Dost thou know? Its native to our nature to desire To weare thy Shine. Our Sparkling Eyes bestow Their kisses on the Cheeks thou dost attire. Our Fancies fed therewith grow lively briske. Acts always lodged in happy glances frisk. Then Glory as a Metaphor, Il 'tende And lay it all on thee, my Lord! to bring My Heart in Flames of love, its rayes out send Whose Curled tops shall ever to thee cling. But all the glory Sunbeams on them beare Is but a Smoaky vapour to thy Weare. To see thee king it in mount Zion bright And in Jerusalem, wherein the Shine Of thy Right Scepter pinkt with Starrs of Light Thy Gospell Law, and Miracles Divine, Enravish may my Soule untill it flies To thee upon the Wings of Extasies. To see thee thron'de in Spirituall Zion Bright, Where Sanctifying Grace doth gild the Throne Raisd in the heart In which thou sitst as Light And swayst the Realm of thoughts, now gracious grown Where Sins arraignd are sentenced and slain Will hearts with rapid raptures entertain, To see thee reign in Heavenly Zion, Oh! Wherein the Throne of Glory all beset With Sparkling Angells round about it throw Bright flashes of their glory as they step Thee to attend, exceeds all Sight each way And make might to my Soule, all Heavenly day. The Suns bright Glory's but a smoky thing Though it oft 'chants mans fancy with its flashes. All other glories, that from Creatures spring Are less than that: but both are sorry Swashes. But thine is purely bright, and spotless cleare That will inravish in the Heavenly Sphere. Then set thy Throne, Lord, in my Souls bright Hall: And in thy throne let Grace enthroned bee And let thy Grace gild ore thy Palace Wall And let thy Scepter sway and rule in mee. While in my heart thou'rt thron'd my Quill shall greet Thyselfe with Zions Songs in musick Sweet. 101. Meditation. Isai. 24.23. Then shall the Moon be Confounded, and the Sun ashamed when the Lord of host shall rain in Mount ZionâGloriously. 15.2m [Apr.] 1711. Glory, thou Shine of Shining things made fine To fill the Fancy peeping through the Eyes At thee that wantons with thy glittering Shine That onely dances on the Outside guise Yet art the brightest blossom fine things bring To please our Fancies with and make them sing. But spare me, Lord, if I while thou dost use This Metaphor to make thyselfe appeare In taking Colours, fancy it to Choose To blandish mine affections with and Cheare Them with thy glory, ever shining best. Thus brought to thee so takingly up dresst. May I but Eye thy Excellency's guise From which thy glory flows, all sparkling bright Th'Property of all thy Properties Being both inside, and their Outside Light The flowing flakes of brightest glories flame Would my affections set on fire amain. Thy Holy Essence, and its Properties Divine and Human all this Glory ware. Thou art Bright Sun Glorie the Beams our Eyes Are gilded with which from its body are. Magnetick vertue raising Exhalation Out of the humble soule unto thy Station. My blissful Lord, thou and thy properties And all thy Adjuncts that upon thee throng Enbedded altogether up arise And moulded up into a Splenderous Sun And in thy Kingly Glory out do shine In Zions mount, outshineing Glories line. Created Glory dangling on all things Of brightest sweet breathd flowers and Fields and glaze The spurred starry Tribes whose sparkling wings Flur glory down in Shining Beames and Rayes Do blush and are asham'd of all their grace Beholding that bright Glory of thy Face. The Silver Candlesticks of th'heaven bright, Bearing the Blazing torches round about The Moon and Sun the Worlds bright Candle's light These Candles flames thy Glory blows all out. These Candle flames lighting the World as tapers, Set in thy Sunshine seem like smokie vapors. The Glory bright of Glorified Saints And brightest Glory sparkling out with grace Comparde with thine my Lord is but as Paint But glances on them of thy glorious Face. Its weak reflection of thy glories Shine, Painting their Walls not to compare with thine. But, Lord, art thou deckt up in glory thus? And dost thou in this Glory come and Wooe To bring our hearts to thee compelling us With such bright arguments of Glories hew? Oh! Adamantine Hearts if we withstand Such taking Charming pleas in Glories hand. Thy splendid glory lapt in Graces mantle Confer on mee Lord, with thy gracious hand. Let not my feet upon such glory trample But make me for thee and thy Glory stand. If that thy Gracious Glory win my Heart Thy Glory's Grace I'le on Shoshannims harp. 102. Meditation. Mat. 26.26. While they were Eating, he took Bread and Blessed etc. 10.4m [June] 1711. What Grace is here? Looke ery way and see How Grace's Splendor like the bright Sun, shines Out on my head, and I encentred bee Within the Center of its radien lines, Thou glories King send out thy Kingly Glory In shining Institutions laid before mee. The Basis of thy gracious functions stands Ensocketted in thy Essentiall Grace As its foundation, Rock (not loose loose Sands) Bearing the Splendor of this shining face Th'New Covenant, Whose Articles Divine Do far surmount lines wrote in Gold for Shine. And as the King of Zion thou putst out Thy Institutions, Zions Statutes, th'Laws Of thy New Covenant, which all through out Thy bright Prophetick trumpet sounds, its Cause. To this New Covenant, thou sets thy hand And Royall Seale eternally to stand. A Counterpane indented right with this Thou giv'st indeed a Deed of Gift to all That Give to thee their Hearts, a Deed for bliss. Which with their hands and Seales they sign too shall. One seale they at the Articling embrace: The other oft must be renew'd, through grace. Unto the Articles of this Contract Our Lord did institute even at the Grave Of the Last Passover, when off its packt. This Seale for our attendance oft to have. This Seal made of New Cov'nant wax, red di'de, In Cov'nant blood, by faith to be appli'de. Oh! this Broad Seale, of Grace's Covenant Bears, Lord, thy Flesh set in its rim aright. All Crucifide and blood, (Grace hath no want) As shed for us, and on us us to White. Let's not neglect this gracious law nor breake But on this Flesh and blood both drinke and Eate. Seing thou, Lord, thy Cov'nant writst in blood My blood red Sins to blot out quite from me Bathe thou my Soule in this sweet gracious flood, Give me thy Grace that I may live to thee. My heart, thy harp, make, and thy Grace my string. Thy Glory then shall be my Song I'l sing. 103. Meditation. Mat. 26.26. As they were eating he tooke bread etc. 12.6m [Aug.] 1711. The Deity did call a Parliament Of all the Properties Divine to sit About mankinde. Justice her Law out went. All Vote man's life to stand or fall by it, But Grace gave band securing Gods Elect. Justice, if Wisdom tended Grace, accepts. Man out doth come, and soon this Law disgrac't. Justice offended, Grace to worke doth Fall And in the way of Purest wisdom, traced New Covenants man and to return him calls. Erects New Cov'nant worship suited to His present State to save him from all Woe. And in this Course Glory to offer bright Through Graces Hand unto Almighty God Her Credits Good. Justice therein delights. Rests in her Bill yet Grace prepares a Rod That if her subjects her sweet rules neglect, She with her golden rod may them Correct. New Covenant worship Wisdom first proclaims Deckt up in Types and Ceremonies gay. Rich Metaphors the first Edition gains. A Divine key unlocks these trunks to lay All spirituall treasures in them open Cleare. The Ark and Mannah, in't, Christ and Good Cheere. This first Edition did the Cov'nant tend With Typick Seales and Rites and Ceremonie That till the Typick Dispensations end Should ratify it as Gods Testimony. 'Mong which the Passover (whose Kirnell's Christ) Tooke place with all its Rites, graciously spic't. But when the Pay day came their kirnells Pickt. The Shell is cast out hence. Cloudes flew away. Now Types good night, with Ceremonies strict, The Glorious Sun is risen, its broad day. Now Passover farewell, and leave thy Place. Lords Supper seales the Covenant of Grace. But though the Passover is passt away. And Ceremonies that belong'd to it, Yet doth its kirnell and their Kirnell stay Attending on the Seale succeeding it. The Ceremony parting leaves behinde Its Spirit to attend this Seale designd. As it passt off, it passt its place o're to The Supper of the Lord (Choice Feast) to seale The Covenant of Grace thus, even so The Ceremoniall Cleaness did reveale A Spirituall Cleaness qualifying all That have a Right to tend this Festivall. All must grant Ceremonies must have Sense. Or Ceremonies are but senseless things. Had God no reason when, for to dispense His Grace, he ope'd all Ceremoniall Springs? The reason why God deckt his sacred Shine With Senseless Ceremonies, here Divine. A Typick Ceremony well attends A Typick Ordinance, these harmonize. A Spirituall Ordinance the Type suspendes And Onely owneth Spirituall Qualities To have a right thereto. And this the Will The dying Ceremony made, stands still. Morall, and Ceremoniall cleaness, which The Pascall Lamb requir'd Foreshow the Guests Must at the Supper Seale with Spoiles be rich Of Sin and be with Saving Grace up dresst. God Chose no Ceremonies for their sake But for Signification did them take. Give me true Grace that I may grace thy Feast. My Gracious Lord, and so sit at thy Table. Thy Spirituall Dainties this Rich Dress at least Will have the Guests have. Nothing less is able To prove their right to't. This therefore bestow. Then as I eate, my lips with Grace shall flow. 104. Meditation. Matth. 26.26.27. He tooke Bread.âAnd he also tooke the Cup 30.7m [Sept.] 1711. What? Bread, and Wine, My Lord! Art thou thus made? And made thus unto thine in th'Sacrament? These are both Cordiall: and both displai'd Food for the Living. Spirituall Nourishment. Thou hence art food, and Physick rightly 'pli'de To Living Souls. Such none for dead provide. Stir up thy Appetite, my Soule, afresh, Here's Bread, and Wine as Signs, to signify The richest Dainties Cookery can Dress Thy Table with, filld with felicity. Purge out and Vomit by Repentance all Ill Humours which thy Spirituall Tast forestall. Bread, Yea substantiall Bread dresst daintily Gods White bread made of th'kidnie of Wheate Ground in his Mill to finest Flowre, we spy, Searc'de through his strict right Bolter, all compleate Moulded up by Gods hand and baked tite In Justices hot oven, Gods Cake-bread white. It is Gods Temple bread; the fine Flower Cake. The pure Shew Bread on th'golden Table set, Before the Mercy-Seate in golden Plate, Thy Palate for this Zions Simnill whet. If in this oyled Wafer thou dost eate Celestiall Mannah, Oh! the Happy meate. But that's not all. Here's wine too of brave State. The Blood, the pure red blood of Zions Grape Grounde in the Mill of Righteousness to 'bate Gods firy wrath and presst into the Shape Of Royall Wine in Zion's Sacred bowles That Purges Cleanse and Chearish doth poore Soules. This Bread, and Wine hold forth the selfe same thing As they from their first Wheat and Vine made flow Successively into their Beings, bring The manner of Christs Manhood and forth show It was derived from th'head Humanity Through Generations all successively. And as this Bread and Wine receive their forms Not fram'd by natures acting, but by Art. So Christs Humanity was not ere born By natures Vertue which she did impart. But by Almighty power which acted so Transendently, did nature overdoe. These two are of all food most Choice indeed Do Emblemise Christ's Elementall frame Most Excellent and fine, of refinde Seed, With Sparkling Grace deckt, and their Works in flame As grafted in and flowing from his Nature And here is food of which his are partaker. Bread must be broke and Eate Wine pourd out too And drunke and so they feed and do delight. Christ broken was upon Gods wheele (its true) And so is spirituall bread that feeds aright And his Choice blood shead for our Sins is made Drinke for our Souls: a Spirituall Drinke displaid. Food though its ne're so rich, doth not beget Nor make its Eaters; but their Lives mentain. This Bread and Wine begets not Souls; but's set 'Fore spirituall life to feed upon the Same. This Feast is no Regenerating fare. But food for those Regenerate that are. Spit out thy Fur, my Tongue; renew thy Tast. Oh! whet thine Appetite, and cleanly brush Thy Cloaths and trim thy Soule. Here food thou hast Of Royall Dainties, that requires thee thus That thou adorned be in Spirituall State: This Bread ne're moulds, nor wine entoxicate. They both are Food, and Physick, purge out Sin From right Receivers. Filth, and Faults away: They both are Cordialls rich, do Comfort bring. Make Sanctifying Grace thrive ery day, Making the spirituall man hate spirituall sloath And to abound in things of Holy growth. Lord, feed me with th'Bread of thy Sacrament: And make me drinke thy Sacramentall Wine: That I may Grow by Graces nourishment Wash't in thy Vinall liquour till I shine, And rai'd in Sparkling Grace unto thy Glory, That so my Life may be a gracious story. 105. Meditation. Matt. 26.26. Jesus tooke Bread and blessed it, and brake it. 23.10m [Dec.] 1711. If I was all well melted down, refinde In graces Furnace and run in the mould Of bright bright Glory, that with Glory shinde More bright than glory doth, my Lord I would Crown thee therewith thou shouldst have all, except The dross I in refining did eject. Hast thou unto thy Godhead nature tooke My nature and unto that nature joyn'de Making a Union thereby, whose root Too deep's for reasons delving toole to finde, Which is held out thus by thy Taking Bread, In this sweet Feast in which our Souls are fed? This Union, that it is, wee clearely see But se not How, or What it is; although We stande and gaze on't, at't amazed bee. But Why it is Grace graciously doth show. These natures thus United have (as't shown) Each done by each, what neither could alone. The Reason of it Grace declares, whose hand This Union made; its made (and thinke hereon) That so our Nature Cansell might that Bande. She'd forfeited, and Justice sude upon. For natures Purse could not the Fine defray. Hence she had Gold from Godheads Mint to pay. This Mystery more rich than massy gold Our Lord lapt up in a Choice napkin fine Of Heavenly trade an Ordinance that hold The same out doth to us all sweet, Divine, That this might live, he in his Dying night Portraide it on his Supper last, as light. To shew that he our nature took, he then Tooke breade, and wine best Elementall trade, Designed as the Sign thereof. Which when He had his blessing over it display'de To shew his Consecration, then it brake, To signify his Sufferings for our sake. Hence in this Bread, and Wine thou dost present Thyselfe, my Lord, Celestiall Food indeed, Rich spirituall fare Soul-Food, Faiths nourishment, And such as doth all Saving Graces feed. For which an Heavenfull of thanks, all free, Is not too much my Lord to render thee. Yet my poore Pipe can hardly stut a tune Above an hungry thanks unto thy name For all this grace, My Lord, My heart perfume With greater measures, till thy Grace out flame And leade mee on in Graces path along To Glory, then I'l sing a brighter song. 106. Meditation. Matth. 26.26.27âtake EateâDrinke yee. 17.12m [Feb.] 1711. I fain would Prize, and Praise thee, Lord, but finde My Prizing Faculty imprison'd lyes. That its Appreciation is confinde Within its prison walls and small doth rise. Its Prizing Act it would mount up so high That might oremount its possibility. I fain would praise thee, but want words to do't: And searching ore the realm of thoughts finde none Significant enough and therefore vote For a new set of Words and thoughts hereon And leap beyond the line such words to gain In other Realms, to praise thee: but in vain. Me pitty, parden mee and Lord accept My Penny Prize, and penny worth of Praise. Words and their Sense within thy bounds are kept And richer Fruits my Vintage cannot raise. I can no better bring, do what I can: Accept thereof and make me better man. With Consecrated Bread and Wine indeed Of Zions Floore, and Wine press me sustain. These fruits thy Boddy, and thy blood doth breed Thy Pay and Purchase for mee mee to gain. Lord make thy Vitall Principall in mee In Gospellwise to eate and drink on thee. These acts of mine that from thy Vitall Spark In mee being to thyself, my Lord, my Deare, As formative in touching thee their marke Of this thy Sacrament, my Spirituall Cheere. Life first doth Act and Faith that's lifes First-born Receiving gives the Sacramentall form. Hence its as needfull as the forme unto This Choice formation Hypocrites beg on. Elfes Vizzarded, and Lambskinde Woolves hence goe. Your Counterfeted Coine is worse than none. Your gilding though it may the Schoole beguile The Court will Cast and all your gilt off file. Morality is here no market ware, Although it in the Outward Court is free. A State of Sin this Banquet cannot beare. Old and New Cov'nant Guests here don't agree. The Wedden Robe is Welcome, but the back This Supper cloaths not with, that doth it lack. Food is for living Limbs, not Wooden legs: Life's necessary, unto nourishment. Dead limbs must be cut off: the Addle Eggs Rot by the heat the dam upon them spent. A State of Sin that takes this bread and Wine From the Signatum tareth off the Signe. A Principle of life, to eate implies, And of such life that sutes the Foods desire. Food naturall doth naturall Life supply. And spirituall food doth spirituall life require. The Dead don't eate. Though Folly childish dotes In th'Child that gives his Hobby horses oates. To Eat's an Act of life that life out sent Employing Food. Life's property alive Yet acts uniting with foods nourishment Which spreads o're nature quite to make it thrive. Life Naturall and Spirituall Life renewd Precedes their Acts, their Acts precede their food. Then form mee Lord, a former here to bee Of this thy Sacrament receiving here And let me in this Bread and Wine take thee: And entertain me with thy Spirituall Cheer. Which well Concocted will make joy up start, That makes thy praises leape up from my heart. 107. Meditation. Lu. 22.19. This do in remembrance of Mee. 13.2m [Apr.] 1712. Oh! what a Lord is mine? There's none like him. Born heir of th'Vastest Realms, and not Confinde, Within, nor o're the Canopy or rim Of th'Starry Region, and as vastly kinde. But's bright'st Dominion gloriously lies In th'Realm of Angells above the Starry Skies. When man had sin'd he saw that nothing could In all's Dominnion Satisfaction make To milke white Justice, but himselfe, who should Then Drinke Deaths health, he did the matter take Upon himselfe by Compact, new and good On such Conditions that requir'd his blood. Yet entred he in Cov'nant with God, The Father for to do the thing himselfe Which to perform he took a Humane Clod In union to his Godhead, it enwealth, That he might in it fully pay the Score Of's fallen friends, and them from death restore. And having in our nature well sufficde The hungry law, with active Righteousness His life did pay our debt. Death him surprizde. His blood he made the Law's sufficing mess. With Active and with Passive duties hee Balanc't th'accounts, and set the Captives free. But drawing nigh upon Death's Coasts indeed He made his Will bequeathing legacies To all his Children, a Choice Holy seed As they did up in Covenant new arise. He his last Night them feasts and at that meale His Supper institutes his Cov'nant Seale. Four Causes do each thing produc'd attend: The End, Efficient, Matter and the Form. These last th'Efficient passt through to the End, And so obtains the same the babe is born. So in this Supper causes foure attend Th'Efficient, Matter, Form, and now the End. The Primall End whereof is Obsignation Unto the Covenant of Grace most sweet. Another is a right Commemoration Of Christs Rich Death upon our hearts to keep And to declare his own till he again Shall come. This Ordinance doth at these aim. And Secondary Ends were in Christ's Eye In instituting of this Sacrament, As Union, and Communion Sanctity Held with himselfe by these usd Elements In Union and Comunion which are fit, Of Saints Compacted in Church Fellowship. But lest this Covenant of Grace should ere Be held by doubting Saints all Violate By their infirmities as Adams were By one transgression and be so vacate Its Seale is food and's often to be usd, To seale new pardons freshening faith, misusd. Then make me, Lord, at thy Sweet Supper spy Thy graces all well flourishing in mee. And seale me pardon up and ratify Thy Covenant with mee, thus gracious bee. My Faculties all deckt with grace shall Chime Thy praise, with Angells and my grace shall shine. 108. Meditation. Matt. 26.26.27. Jesus took breadâand he took the Cup 8.4m [June] 1712. What Royall Feast Magnificent is this, I am invited to, where all the fare Is spic'd with Adjuncts, (ornamentall bliss) Which are its robes it ever more doth ware? These Robes of Adjuncts shining round about Christs golden Sheers did cut exactly out. The Bread and Wine true Doctrine teach for faith (True Consequence from Truth will never ly) Their Adjuncts teach Christs humane nature hath A Certain place and not Ubiquity. Hence this Condemns Ubiquitarians And whom deny Christs Manhood too it damns. It Consubstantiation too Confounds. Bread still is bread, Wine still is wine its sure. It Transubstantiation deadly wounds. Your touch, Tast, Sight say true. The Pope's a whore. Can Bread and Wine by words be Carnifide? And manifestly bread and Wine abide? What monsterous thing doth Transubstantiation And Consubstantiation also make Christs Body, having a Ubique-Station, When thousands Sacraments men Celebrate Upon a day, if th'Bread and wine should e're Be Con?, or Trans-Substantiated there? If in Christs Doctrine taught us in this Feast, There lies No ly. (And Christ can never ly) The Christian Faith cannot abide at least To dash out reasons brains, or blinde its eye. Faith never blindeth reasons Eye but cleares Its Sight to see things quite above its Sphere. These Adjuncts shew this feast is ray'd in ware Of Holiness enlin'de with honours Shine. Its Sabbath Entertainment, spirituall fare. It's Churches banquet, Spirituall Bread and Wine. It is the Signet of the Kings right hande, Seale to the Covenant of Grace Gods bande. The Sign, bread, made of th'kidnies of Wheate That grew in Zions field: And th'juyce we sup Presst from the grape of Zions Vine sweet, great Doth make the Signall Wine within the Cup. Those Signals Bread and Wine are food that bear Christ in them Crucified, as spirituall fare. Here is a feast indeed! in ev'ry Dish A Whole Redeemer, Cookt up bravely, Good, Is served up in holy Sauce that is, A mess of Delicates made of his blood, Adornd with graces Sippits: rich Sweet-Meats. Comfort and Comforts sweeten whom them eats. Lord, Make thou me at this rich feast thy Guest And let my food a whole redeemer bee. Let Grace Carve him for mee in ev'ry mess: And rowle her Cuttings in this Sawce for mee. If thou me fatten with this Faire While here. Here after shall thy praise be my good Cheere. 109. Meditation. Mat. 26.26.27: And gave it to his Disciples. 3.6m [Aug.] 1712. A Feast is said to be for Laughter made. Belshazzars Feast was made for Luxury. Ahashueru's feast for pomp's displayde. George Nevill's Feast at Yorks, for gluttony. But thou my Lord a Spirituall Feast hast dresst Whereat the Angells gaze. And Saints are Guests. Suppose a Feast in such a Room is kept Thats deckt in flaming Guildings every where, And richest Fare in China Chargers deckt And set on golden Tables. Waiters there In flaming robes waite pouring Royall wine In Jasper Cups out. Oh! what glories shine? But all this Glorious Feast seems but a Cloud, My Lord, unto the Feast thou makst for thine. Although the matters thou hast thine allowd, Plain as a pike Staffe bee, as Bread and Wine, This feast doth fall below thine, Lord, as far As the bright Sun excells a painted Star. Thine is a Feast, the Funerall feast to prize The Death, Oh! my Redeemer, of the Son Of God Almighty King of Heaven and'ts joys, Where spirituall food disht on thy Table comes. All Heavenly Bread and Spirituall Wine, rich rare, Almighty gives, here's Mannah, Angells Fare. This Feast indeed yields gracious Laughing ripe Wherein its Authour laugheth Hell to Scorn: Lifts up the Soule that drowns in tears, a wipe To give th'old Serpent. Now his head piece's torn. Thou art, my Lord, the Authour, and beside The Good Cheer of this Feast, as Crucifide. The Palace where thou this dost Celebrate Is New Jerusalem with Precious Stones Walld in: all pavde with Gold: and Every Gate, A precious pearle: An Angell keeps each one. And at the Table head, more rich than gold, Dost sit thyselfe, and thy rich fare unfold. Thy Table's set with fare that doth Excell The richest Bread, and Wine that ever were Squeezd out of Corn or Vines: and Cookt up well. Its Mannah, Angells food. Yea, Heavens Good Cheer. Thou art the Authour, and the Feast itselfe. Thy Table Feast hence doth excell all wealth. Thou sittest at the table head in Glory, With thy brave guests With grace adornd and drest. No Table e're was set like thine, in Story, Or with such guests as thine was ever blesst, That linings have embroider'd as with gold, And upper robes all glorious to behold. They'r Gods Elect, and thy Selected Ones, Whose Inward man doth ware rich robes of Grace, Tongues tipt with Zion Languague, Precious Stones. Their Robes are quilted ore with graces lace. Their Lives are Checker work of th'Holy Ghost. Their 'ffections journy unto Heavens Coast. The Subjects that at first sat at this feast With Christ himselfe, faithfull Disciples were Whose gracious frames 'fore this time so increast Into Apostleship that brought them here. Who when Christ comes in Glory, saith, they shall Sit with him on twelve thrones in's Judgment hall. These sample out the Subjects and the Guests That Welcome are unto this Table bright, As Qualifide Disciples up well drest In Spiritual apparell whitend white Else Spot there's in this feast. They cannot thrive For none can eate, or ere he be alive. Thou satst in flaming Grace at table head. Thy flaming Grace falling upon the rest That with thee sat, did make their graces shed Their Odours out most sweet which they possesst. Judas that graceless wretch packt hence before. That onely gracious ones enjoyd this Store. Lord Deck my Soule with thy bright Grace I pray: That I may at thy Table Welcome bee, Thy hand Let take my heart its Captive prey In Chains of Grace that it ne're slip from thee. When that thy Grace hath set my heart in trim My Heart shall end thy Supper with an Hymn. 110. Meditation. Matt. 26.30. When they had sung an Hymn. 5.8m [Oct.] 1712. The Angells sung a Carole at thy Birth, My Lord, and thou thyselfe didst sweetly sing An Epinicioum at thy Death, on Earth And order'st thine, in memory of this thing Thy Holy Supper, closing it at last Up with an Hymn, and Choakst the foe thou hast. This Feast thou madst in memory of thy death Which is disht up most graciously: and towers Of reeching vapours from thy Grave (Sweet breath) Aromatize the Skies. That sweetest Showers Richly perfumed by the Holy Ghost, Are rained thence upon the Churches Coast. Thy Grave beares flowers to dress thy Church withall. In which thou dost thy Table dress for thine. With Gospell Carpet, Chargers, Festivall And Spirituall Venison, White Bread and Wine Being the Fruits thy Grave brings forth and hands Upon thy Table where thou waiting standst. Dainties most rich, all spiced o're with Grace, That grow out of thy Grave do deck thy Table To entertain thy Guests, thou callst, and place Allowst, with welcome, (and this is no Fable) And with these Guests I am invited to't And this rich banquet makes me thus a Poet. Thy Cross planted within thy Coffin beares Sweet Blossoms and rich Fruits, Whose steams do rise Out of thy Sepulcher and purge the aire Of all Sins damps and fogs that Choake the Skies. This Fume perfumes Saints hearts as it out peeps Ascending up to bury thee in th'reechs. Joy stands on tiptoes all the while thy Guests Sit at thy Table, ready forth to sing Its Hallilujuhs in sweet musicks dress Waiting for Organs to imploy herein. Here matter is allowd to all, rich, high, My Lord, to tune thee Hymns melodiously. Oh! make my heart thy Pipe: the Holy Ghost The Breath that fills the same and Spiritually. Then play on mee thy pipe that is almost Worn out with piping tunes of Vanity. Winde musick is the best if thou delight To play the same thyselfe, upon my pipe. Hence make me, Lord, thy Golden Trumpet Choice And trumpet thou thyselfe upon the same Thy heart enravishing Hymns with Sweetest Voice. When thou thy Trumpet soundst, thy tunes will flame. My heart shall then sing forth thy praises sweet When sounded thus with thy Sepulcher reech. Make too my Soul thy Cittern, and its wyers Make my affections: and rub off their rust With thy bright Grace. And screw my Strings up higher And tune the same to tune thy praise most Just. Ile close thy Supper then with Hymns, most sweet Burr'ing thy Grave in thy Sepulcher's reech. 111. Meditation. 1. Cor. 10.16. The Cup of blessing which wee bless, is it not the Comunion of the body of Christ? etc. 7.10m [Dec.] 1712. Oh! Gracious Grace! whither soarst thou? How high Even from thy root to thy top branch dost tower? Thou springst from th'essence of blesst Deity And grow'st to th'top of Heavens all blissfull flower. Thou art not blackt but brightend by the Sin Of Gods Elect, whom thou from filth dost bring. Thou Graces Egg layst in their very hearts Hatchest and brudl'st in this nest Divine Its Chickin, that it fledge. And still impartsts It influences, through their lives that shine. Them takest by the hand, and handst them o're The Worlds wild waves to the Celestiall Shoare. And as thou leadst them 'long the way to glory Thou hast the Wells of Aqua Vitae cleare. For them to take good drachms of (Oh! blesst Story) And Inns to entertain them with good Cheere. That so they may not faint, but upward grow Unto their ripeness, and to glory Soe. They take a drachm of Heavenly Spirits in, From every Duty. Here is blessed Ware. Thou hast them draughts of Spiritual Liquour gi'n And ev'ry Sabbath tenders us good fare, But Oh! the Supper of our Lord! What joy? This Feast doth fat the Soul most graceously. Theandrick Blood, and Body With Compleate Full Satisfaction and rich Purchase made Disht on this golden Table, spirituall meate Stands. And Gods Saints are Welcom'd with this trade The Satisfaction, and the Purchase which Thy Blood and Body made, how Good,? how rich? Oh! blesst effects flow from this table then. The feeding on this fare and Spiritually Must needs produce a Spirituall Crop for them That rightly do this table fare enjoy Whatever other Ordinances doe! This addeth Seale, and Sealing wax thereto. This is a Common that consists of all That Christ ere had to give. And oh! how much! Of Grace and Glory here? These ripe fruits fall Into Saints baskets: they up gather Such. All fruits that other ordinances which Are Edifying, Do this Feast enrich. But still besides these there are properly Its own effects which it doth beare and hath. Its Spirituall Food that nourisheth spiritualy. The new born babe to thrive in using Faith The Soule it quiets: Conscience doth not sting. It seales fresh pardon to the Soul of Sin. It maketh Charity's sweet rosy breath Streach o're the Whole Society of Saints. It huggeth them. That nothing of the Earth Or its infection its affections taints. Grace now grow strong, Faith sturdy. Joy, and Peace And other Vertues in the Soule encrease. Gods Love shines brighter now upon the heart: In that he seals Christ Dying with a Feast Wherein he smiles doth on the Soul impart: With all Christs Righteousness: Joy now's increast. The Soul grows valient and resists the foe. The Spirituall Vigour vigorous doth grow. Lord, on thy Commons let my Spirits feed So nourish thou thy new Born babe in mee. At thy Communion Table up mee breed Communicate thy Blood and Body free. Thy Table yielding Spirituall Bread, and Wine Will make my Soul grow brisk, thy praise to Chime. 112. Meditation. 2 Cor. 5.14. If one died for all then are all Dead. 15.12m [Feb.] 1712. Oh! Good, Good, Good, my Lord. What more Love yet. Thou dy for mee! What, am I dead in thee? What did Deaths arrow shot at me thee hit? Didst slip between that flying shaft and mee? Didst make thyselfe Deaths marke shot at for mee? So that her Shaft shall fly no far than thee? Di'dst dy for mee indeed, and in thy Death Take in thy Dying thus my death the Cause? And lay I dying in thy Dying breath, According to Graces Redemption Laws? If one did dy for all, it needs must bee That all did dy in one, and from death free. Infinities fierce firy arrow red Shot from the splendid Bow of Justice bright Did smite thee down, for thine. Thou art their head. They di'de in thee. Their death did on thee light. They di'de their Death in thee, thy Death is theirs. Hence thine is mine, thy death my trespass clears. How sweet is this: my Death lies buried Within thy Grave, my Lord, deep under ground, It is unskin'd, as Carrion rotten Dead. For Grace's hand gave Death its deadly wound. Deaths no such terrour on th'Saints blesst Coast. Its but a harmless Shade: No walking Ghost. The Painter lies: the Bellfrey Pillars weare A false Effigies now of Death, alas! With empty Eyeholes, Butter teeth, bones bare And spraggling arms, having an Hour Glass In one grim paw. Th'other a Spade doth hold To shew deaths frightfull region under mould. Whereas its Sting is gone: its life is lost. Though unto Christless ones it is most Grim Its but a Shade to Saints whose path it Crosst, Or Shell or Washen face, in which she sings Their Bodies in her lap a Lollaboy And sends their Souls to sing their Masters joy. Lord let me finde Sin, Curse and Death that doe Belong to me ly slain too in thy Grave. And let thy law my clearing hence bestow And from these things let me acquittance have. The Law suffic'de: and I discharg'd, Hence sing Thy praise I will over Deaths Death, and Sin. 113. Meditation. Rev. 22.16. I am the Root and Offspring of David. 12.2m [Apr.] 1713. Help, oh! my Lord, anoint mine Eyes to see How thou art Wonderfull thyselfe all ore, A Common Wealth of Wonders: Rich Vine tree Whose Boughs are reevd with miracles good Store. Let thy Sweet Clew lead me thy Servant right Throughout this Labyrinth of Wonders bright. Here I attempt thy rich delightfull Vine Whose bowing boughs buncht with sweet clusters, ripe Amongst the which I take as Cordiall wine This Bunch doth bleed into my Cup delight. It Cramps my thoughts. What Root, and Offspring too Of David: Oh! how can this thing be true? What top and bottom, Root and Branch unto The selfe same tree how can this be? oh-fiddle! It cannot be. This thing may surely goe As harder far to read than Sampsons Riddle. A Father and a Son to th'selfe same man! This wond'rous is indeed: read it who can. The Root the tree, the Tree the branch doth beare. The tree doth run between the branch, and Root. The root and branch are too distinct a pair To be the same: Cause and Effect they sute. How then is Christ the Root, and Offspring bright Of David, Shew, come, read this riddle right. Lend me thy key, holy Eliakim, T'unlock the doore untill thy glory shine. And by thy Clew me thorow lead and bring Cleare through this Labyrinth by this rich twine. Posamnitick's Labyrinth now doth appeare An Easy thing unto the passage here. But this doth seem the key unto the Lock. Thy Deity, my Lord, is Davids root: It sprang from it: its rooted on this rock. Thy Humane nature is its Offspring-Sute. Thy Deity gave David Being, though Thy Humane Being did from David flow. Hence thou both Lord, and Son of David art, Him Being gav'st, and Being tookst of him. This doth unbolt the Doore, and light impart To shew the nature of this wondrous thing. Hence two best natures do appeare to stand United in thy Person hand in hand. My blessed Lord, thou art like none indeed. Godhead, and Manhood harmonize in thee. Hence thou alone wee mediator read, 'Tween God, and Man, and setst Gods Children free From all Gods wrath, and wholy them restore Into that Favour, which they lost before. Hence give thou me true Faith in thee to have: Make me thy branch, be thou my root thyselfe, And let thy Grace root in my heart, I Crave And let thy purchase be my proper Wealth: And when this Sweet hath in my heart full Sway My sweetest musick shall thy praise display. 114. Meditation. Rev: 22.16. The bright and morning Star. 9.6m [Aug.] 1713. A Star, Bright Morning Star, the shining Sun Of Righteousness, in Heaven Lord thou art. Thou pilotst us by night, which being run Away, thou bidst all darkness to depart. The Morning Star peeps up an usher gay 'Fore th'Sun of Righteousness to grace the day. All men benighted are by fall, and Sin: Thou Graces pole star art to pilote's from it: The night of Sorrow and Desertion spring, Thou morning Starr dost rise, and not a Comet. This night expired now, is dead and gone: The Day Spring of sweet Comfort cometh on. The Morning Star doth rise, Dews gracious fall: And spirituall Herbs, and sweet Celestiall flowers Sprinkled therewith most fragrantly do call The Day Star up, with golden Curls, and Towers Put back the Curtains of the azure skies And gilde the aire while that the Sun doth rise. The night of Persecution up arose. Not Even, but the morning star there to Soon riseth: vant ill looks: the last Cock Crows The Morning Star up: out the Sun doth go. Farewell darke night, Welcome bright gracious day. As Joy Divine comes on, Griefe goes away. This world's a night-shade, or a pitchy night, All Canopi'de with storms and Cloudes all darke. Sending out thunders, Lightnings and with might, But thou our Pole star art, which we must marke. While th'morning Star hands dawning light along: Let Grace sing now, Birds singing time is come. Whilst thou, my Pole-star shinst my Lord, on mee Let my poore pinnace saile thereby aright, Through this darke night untill its harbor bee The Daystars bay, the spring of dayly light, The Usher bidding of the night, good night And Day, Good morrow lightend with delight. If I by thee, my Pole star, steere aright Through this dark night of foule hard weather here My Vessell safely to the harbour bright Of thee, my Morning Star, ere shining clear. I then shall soon Eternal Day possess Wherever shines the Sun of Righteousness. Grant me, my Lord, by thee, my Star to steere. Through this darke vale of tears untill I meet, Thee here my morning Star outshining cleare, Shewing my night is past, and day doth peep. When thou my Sun of Righteousness makst day. My Harp shall thy Eternall praise then play. Thou Jacobs Star, in's Horizon didst rise. And fix't in Heaven, Heavens Steeridge Star. To steer poor sinners out from Enemies Coasts unto Graces Realm, (Best State by far). Thou sentst a star in th'East to lead Wise men Thence to thyselfe, when born in Bethlehem. The golden locks of this bright star, I pray, Make leade us from sins quarters to the Coast Of Graces tillage: darkness from, to th'Bay Of Consolation and the Holy Ghost. And from this Vale of tears to Glory bright Where our tunde breath shall ne're be Choakt by th'night. 115. Meditation. Cant. 5:10. My Beloved. 4.7m [Sept.] 1713. What art thou mine? Am I espousd to thee? What honour's this? It is more bright Renown. I ought to glory more in this sweet glee Than if I'd wore greate Alexanders Crown. Oh! make my Heart loaded with Love ascend Up to thyselfe, its bridegroom, bright, and Friend. Her whole delight, and her Belov'de thou art. Oh! Lovely thou: Oh! grudg my Soule, I say, Thou straitend standst, lockt up to Earths fine parts Course matter truly, yellow earth, Hard Clay. Why should these Clayey faces be the keyes T'lock, and unlock thy love up as they please? Lord, make thy Holy Word, the golden Key My Soule to lock and make its bolt to trig Before the same, and Oyle the same to play As thou dost move them off and On to jig. The ripest Fruits that my affections beare I offer, thee. Oh! my Beloved faire. Thou standst the brightest object in bright glory More shining than the shining sun to 'lure. Unto thyselfe the purest Love. The Stories Within my Soul can hold refinde most pure In flaming bundles polishd all with Grace Most sparklingly about thyselfe t'imbrace. The most refined Love in Graces mint In rapid flames is best bestowd on thee The brightest: metall with Divinest print Thy tribute is, and ever more shall bee. The Loving Spouse and thou her Loved Sweet Make Lovely Joy when she and thee do meet: Thou art so lovely, pitty 'tis indeed That any drop of love the Heart can hold Should be held back from thee, or should proceed To drop on other Objects, young, or old. Best things go best together: best agree: But best are badly usd, by bad that bee. Thou all o're Lovely art, Most lovely Thou: Thy Spouse, the best of Loving Ones: Her Love, The Best of Love: and this she doth avow Thyselfe. And thus she doth thyself approve. That object robs thee of thy due that wares Thy Spouses Love. With thee none in it shares. Lord fill my heart with Grace refining Love. Be thou my onely Well-Belov'd I pray. And make my Heart with all its Love right move Unto thyselfe, and all her Love display. My Love is then right well bestow'd, alone When it obtains thyselfe her Lovely One. My Best love then shall on Shoshannim play, Like David her Sweet Musick, and thy praise Inspire her Songs, that Glory ever may In Sweetest tunes thy Excellency Glaze. And thou shalt be that burden of her Song Loaded with Praise that to thyselfe belong. 116. Meditation Can. 5.10. My Beloved is White, and Ruddy, the Chiefest among ten thousand. 21.9m [Nov.] 1713. When thou, my Lord, mee mad'st, thou madst my heart A Seate for love, and love enthronedst there. Thou also madst an object by thy Art For Love to be laid out upon most Cleare. The ruling Stamp of this Choice object shows God's Beauty, beautifuller than the rose. I sent mine Eye, love's Pursevant, to seek This Object out, the which to naturall I found it mixt with White and Red most sweet. On which love naturall doth sweetly fall. But if its spirituall, then Orient Grace Imbellisheth th'object in this Case. Such Beautie rose in Sharon's Rose and keeps Its pleasing blushes of pure White, and Red Where spirituall blossoms give their Spirituall Reech, And on thy Spirituall Countenance do bed. Thou art this Rose Whose rosy Cheeks are found In purest White and Red of Grace abound. Thou art arrayed in Gods Whitest Lawn And with the purest ruddy looks Sweet Rose, White Righteousness, And Sufferings too out drawn. Thy purest blood thy blessed veans did lose Was Lasht, Gasht slain paying our debts in which Thy beauty rose unto the highest pitch. Hence purest White and red in Spirituall Sense Make up thy Beauty to the Spirituall Eye. Thus thou art object to love Spirituall. Hence The Purest Spirituall Love doth to thee high. Thou art the loveli'st object over spread With brightest beauty Object ever wore Of purest flushes of pure white and red That ever did or could the Love allure. Lord make my Love and thee its Object meet And me in folds of Such Love raptures keep. Oh! thou most beautiful of Objects gay Dart out thy Heavenly beams into my breast. And make thy Beauty Lord, thy Golden key For to unlock and open right my Chest Loves Cabinet and take the best thyselfe Of all my Love therein. Its all thy Wealth. When I bring forth the best of Love to thee And poure its purest Streams all reeching Warm The best of Love, and Beautiest object bee Then met together, Love by Beauties Charm Embrace thyselfe in her pure milke white Hands Thy Holy Beauty lays my love in bands. Thy beauty then shall weare the best of mee. My Love shall then the best of Beauties have. My Love's my best, thy Beauty's best in thee. For thy Best Beauty, my best love I save. While my best love doth thy best beauty greet My purest Love shall sing thy Beauty sweet. 117. Meditation. Cant. 5.10. The Chiefest among ten thousand.

A King thou art, my Lord, yea King of Kings. All Kings shall truckle and fall fore thee down. Thou hast a Kingdom too Whose great bell rings A Passing peale to Worldly Kings and Crowns. Thou art the King of Saints and Angells bright. Thou art the King of Glory, and all Light. Thy Kingdom is with walls encircled Stronger than Walls of Brass or Solid Gold. Its walld about with fire: Stones Cemented With all the Promises Gods booke doth hold. And all its buildings laid upon the Rock Eternall: that Hell gates can't make them shock. Thou hast a Throne, Crown, Scepter, Mace all Rich Richer than golden Crowns, pearld all about. Thou hast a Body of just Laws, all Which Transcend all Lawes that ever Kings put out. Thou also hast both Foes and Enemies That up against thee and thy Realm arise. Thou hast a Standard and a Banner greate. Thy Gospell and all Gospell Grace, its flag: Thy Standards Colours blancht with Grace compleat Enrich thy Banner doth (that is no rag). Thou hast a Drum thou beatest up apace For Volunteers, that thou enlists with Grace.

And lead'st them out against thy foes, the King Abaddon, Divells, Wicked Ones and Sin. Their glittering Swords and Spears Edgd sharp with Grace Wherewith they are well arm'd do surely bring Thy Adversaries under and apace Their hearts do pierce that foes do rise to Ring; And from the fight to th'Throne triumphantly Them leadest while Drums beat and Colours fly. All these thy men under thy flag that fight In ranke and file, and Graces Exercise In all the way go 'till they Come aright Unto thy Palace back triumphing wise Their Colours on their golden Streamers flying Do with thy glorious selfe there enter, joying. Under thy Banner Lord, enlist thou mee. Make me to ware thy Colours, saving grace. Them flourish in my Life, and make thou mee To beare thy Standerd and thy Banner trace And so me to thy Palace Glory bring Where I thy Standards Glory ere may sing. 118. Meditation. Can. 5.11. His Head is most fine Gold. 14.1m [Mar.] 1713. Oh! Hide bound Heart. Harder than mountain Rocks Can not one beam of this bright golden Head Have enterance, thats trim'd with black Curld Locks In all its vigrous green up flowerished My Child affections thus to touch and thaw. And to thy golden head their Spirits draw? The stateliest Head that ever body Bore Not gilt but finest gold, of Heavens Gold. The golden Head that Neb'chadnezzer wore Was but a durt ball to't of tainted mould. It's true indeed, I call't not Deity, But a Bright Emblem of bright Majesty. This Golden head holds Sovereignity And Sovereignity being relative Constrains a golden body Worthily Both politick and properly native. The Best of Humane Bodies Golden should And politicke, ere weare this head of gold. These Bodies fitted to this Golden Head Must needs be golden. Oh the best of all! Because it is their Sovereign: and doth bed And board the best things in its golden Hall. Faith, Hope and Charity and all graces still Out from this Head, and every member fill. The Brains that in this golden brain Pan dwell Must needs be golden, Golden Wisdom breed. Its Eyes weare Golden Apples. Th'Senses Cell Is all fine Gold, all Golden trade indeed. If Wisdom's Palace is the finest Gold, Then Golden laws and statutes hence behold. Hence Golden influences out are sent To Every member of this Golden Head The Body Naturall, Whose acts intent Upon their Golden Rule are Golden bread And hence a golden life my Lord did lead, From top to toe, most gloriously displayd. Also the Body Politick, the Realm Having its members every one possess These golden influences from their Helm Do make all golden motions ever fresh. Hence th'golden Laws with Golden influences A golden race produce and in all senses. Thy Golden Head a golden Kingdom hath To which it Golden Statutes out doth give And golden influences it display'th, That make the Subjects golden lives to live, And by these golden Laws thy walke to hold Thy glorious City to, whose Streets pure gold. Oh! glorious Lord, make mee make thy Gold Head To bee my Sovereign, and make thou mee A member of thy Golden body led By its blesst Golden Lines that lead to thee That as my Life thy lines do parallell, My Harp shall play: thy Golden head Excell. 119. Meditation. Can. 5.12. His Eyes are as the Eyes of Doves by Rivers of Waters washed with milk, and fitly set. 9.3m [May] 1714. My Lord, (my Love,) what loveliness doth ly, In this pert percing fiery Eye of thine? Thy Dove like Eyes ore varnish gloriously Thy Face till it the Heavens over shine. No Eye did ever any face bedight As thine with Charming Beauty and Delight. No Eye holes did at any time enjoy, An apple of an Eye like this of thine Nor ever held an Apple of an Eye Like that thine held. Apple and Eye hole fine Oh! How these Apples and these Eye holes fit, Its Eye Omniscient on its fulness sits! Never were Eyeballs so full trust with might With such rich, sharp, quick visive Spirits tite Nor gave such glances of such beauty bright As thine, my Lord, nor wore so smart a Sight. All bright, All Right, all Holy, Wise, and Cleare Or ere discover did such beauty here. Look here, my Soule, thy Saviours Eye most brisk Doth glaze and make't most Charming beauty weare That Ever Heaven held or ever kisst. All Saints, and Angells at it Gastard stare.

Then they must be the Spirits nest also Wherein the Spirit doth an holy race Hatch, and doth rain Sweet Shoures for grace apace And hands that hand thy Spouse up, tenderly To thy Bride Chamber of Eternall joy. Lord! let these golden Orbs thy hands that have All Graces Operations in them cleare Bestow thy Holy Berill green and brave Upon my Soule, and rain Sweet Dews down there. Upon my Heart and make the Application Of thy rich Grace, and mee its Habitation.

Will not the Vine of Lebanon yield Wine, To quicken up my Spirits? Or have I Not tasted of thy Wine, for to refine My Fancy at thy feast and't vivify?

Be thou the Lilly, me its vally right. Thou th'Lillie then shalt make my Vallys shine Thou feeding mongst the lillies, with delight. I then shall weare thy Lillies Whitness fair. My Lungues like bellows shall puff out sweet air. My Vally then shall filld be with Sweet air.

Thou far the fairest of all female dress Whose spirituall beauty doth arise with Shine Of th'Beams of the blesst Son of Righteousness, Glazing thy face with glory all Divine. All Sparkling Glory like as Moses Face Shining was dreadfull so is thine with grace. Thy Intellects a Saphrin Socket bears Christ's flaming Torch of Grace that sanctifies. Thy Will Christs Cabinet of Rich Grace Wares Top full of Grace of Every Sort and Sise. Thy Body's like a golden Lanthorn trim Through which the lamps of Grace shine from within. Thine Eye balls rowle like fiery balled Sparks That graces beams like fiery arrows fling Whose fiery bullets, graces flaming Darts Most terrible to such as rowle in Sin. Thy Mouths Christs Morter piece lets granades fly Of th'holy Ghost all wicked ones to 'stroy. Nay still the more Artiliry is there. A Brazeel Bow's thy mouth, thy Tong's the String That shoots his Arrows pild, both in and through The Sinners Soules that make deep wounds therein. Yet more, thy mouth doth use his furbusht Sword By thy bright tongue in truth, his dreadfull word. Christs golden Canon Balls that dash asunder, Whereby thou Satans garrisons dost bomb.

Oh! what a word is this thy Lips Let fall. Here in these drops of Honey dews whereby Thou dost bedew mine Olive Copses all Within the garden of my Soul, oh joy? Its such a word so wondrous and so high Hadst not thou said it, sure 'twas blasphemy. How shouldst it be that thou should charge thy Spouse To turn away her glancing face from thee? Whose Charming glances are quick Flames to rouse The dull affections rich flaming Glee And these glances which most delightful be That thou should say they overcome have mee. What do these Eyes then raise thy Joys so much And do they so dilate thy Spirits pure To such a breadth though thou dost joy in such, Thy Spirits run so from thy heart, its sure then robs thy heart of all Its Vitall Spirits that it fainting falls? O wondrous Beauty that doth sorely Cramp Our Wondring Faculty and make it strain Untill it feeble grows and groweth faint If such Eyes Sparkling start us with their flame! Art thou my Lord who are too strong for all Orecome hereby when they upon thee fall? But yet this thy Serprize seems Rationall In some respect seing thy glorious selfe Stands graciously portrayed Ever shall Within thy Spouses Eyes with richest Wealth That Grace's Gold mine hath, so that it seems Thou must these Eyes esteem, ere thy heart 'steems. Seeing thy Spouse that doth consist of all Gods blesst Elect regenerate within The tract of time from first to last send shall From her bright Eyes her gracious beams and fling I wonder't would be topping very high If that such Eyes should not advance thy joy. Then let the Beams of my Souls eye ev'n meet The brightsome Beams of thy blesst Eye my Lord, And in their meeting let them sweetly greet And back return laded as each affords. Mine then return'd well loaded with thine flame Shall tune my harp to sing thy glories fame. My Soul then quickend by thy beames brought in By my Souls Eye beams and glaz'd be thereby With glorious Grace that will mee make more sing Thy praise my Lord, then shall thou have more joy. My Soul strung with thy grace as golden Wier, Will by its musick Raise thy joy the Higher. 137. Meditation. Cant. 6.5. Thy hair is like a flock of Goats that graze on mount Gilliad. 14.7m [Sept.] 1717. How precious are thy thoughts my Lord, to mee! Oh that my thoughts on mee were Crystallizd, Within the same, like Gems that sparkling bee, Like Gilliads Flock of Goats by his so prizde, A precious remedy for th'Souls Distempers. A spirituall Cure on which my Soule adventures. How doth this praise thy Spouse whose Hair doth shine How like a flock of Goats that Gilliad graze And by their keepers set and Order'd fine And stately go in their slick Glory rayes, These hairs assembled like a flock in fold On Gilliads top, there feeding on to hold. Thy Gilliads top Thy Testimonies place, In Zions mount thy testimonies there Thy spirituall pasture whose frim grass is Grace. The Spouses Hairs, thy flock, feed on this Cheere. With Grace thou feedst and fatst thy flock and down Dost make them ly. And in these folds them Crown. In the High places of the City where Wisdome lifts up her Voice and food in't gives Unto the Flock upon her head and there Administers them grace that they may live. These Spirituall Hairs do ware a spirituall grace Feeding in Graces pastures thrive apace. Are these thy Spouses Curled hairs trimd fine Adorning her all in rich Graces Shine Like Gilliads Flocks that Graze her Sweet herbs prime? Make me then one of them an hair of thine, Fed in thy fold. Assemblies pure and fair With Spirituall Crisping pins adorning hair. If thou dost make mee thus one of the Hairs Even of thy Spouse and in thy 'Semblies sit Me with thy Spirits Crisping pins prepare Me as a Curled lock thy glory t'hit. I'st honour then thy Spouse and thee also As I like one of Gilliads flock do grow. 138. Meditation. Can. 6.6. Thy Teeth are like a flock of Sheep that come Up from Washing whereof every one bears twins. 25.9m [Nov.] 1717. My blessed blessing Lord I fain would try To heave thy Glory 'bove the Heavens above, But finde my lisping tongue can never prie It up an inch above this dirt nor move. Thy brightsom glory o're this dirty slough We puddle in below and Wallow now. But though I can but stut and blur what I Do go about and so indeed much marre Do thy bright Shine: I fain would slick up high Although I foul it by my pen's harsh jar. Pardon my faults: they're all against my Will. I would do Well but have too little Skill. What Golden words drop from thy gracious lips, Adorning of thy Speech with Holy paint, Making thy Spouses teeth like lambs that skip, Oh flock of Sheep that come from Washing quaint. Each bearing twins a pleasant sight to spy Whose little lambs have leaping play and joy. a flock of pure Washt Sheep more white: borne babe and Church that hath relief Whose name is in the book of Life wrote right The New born Soule and that Society I such espoused to my Lord most High. What are these Teeth? Pray show, Some do suppose They are the Spouses Military armes: The Arguments that do destroy her Foes: And do defend the Gospell truths from harms, But Teeth in Sheep are not their Wepon though The Lions teeth and Cur dogs teeth are so. And others do say they note Christ's ministers: That dress the Spouses food. Yet such seem Cooks. When these are 'ployd like teeth 'bout meat as its dresser. Yet still this seems a lesson not in books. Methinks Christs Ministers may rather beare The name of Cooks, than Teeth that eat the fare, Hence methinks they the righter judge, that hold These Teeth import true Faith in Christ alone And Meditation on the Gospell, should Be signifide thereby to every one. Teeth are for the eating of the Food made good And Meditation Chawing is the Cud. The proper use of Teeth gives the first stroke Unto the Meat and food we feed upon And fits it for the Stomach there to sooke In its Concoction for nutrition. And Meditation when 'tis Concocted there Take's its rich liquour having nurishment, And distributes the same Choice Spirituall Cheer Through all the new man by its instrument, And hence that means of Grace doth as I thinke Give nurishment hereby as meate and drinke. This Faith and Meditation a pair appears As two like to the two brave rows of Teeth The Upper and the neather, well set cleare Exactly meet to chew the food, beliefe. Both eate by biting; meditation By Chewing Spiritually the Cud thereon. two those two exactly answer right Grindeing them and operation Those in a naturall Sense in spirituall These two, and so they pare, each on their station. The fore and hinder teeth, that bite and Grinde, So Spiritually these bite and Chew in minde. They paire each other too, in whiteness cleare As those like Olivant, these sparkling show With glorious Shine in a most brightsome geare Of spirituall whitness that exceeds pure Snow. Christ's milk white Righteousness and splendent Grace Faith doth and Meditation ever trace. 139. Meditation Cant. 6.[7.] Like a piece of a Pomegranate are thy Temples within thy Locks. My Deare, Deare Lord, oh that my Heart was made Thy Golden Vessel filld with Graces Wine Received from thy Fulness and displaide Even by thy Spouse in her sweet Wine cup fine Unto thy blessed selfe to drinke at Will, Of her Sweet Wine unto thy very fill. Thy Love that's in thy Spouses Countenance Is so delighted with her Temples State, The Seate of Modesty that in't doth glance, Her Temples like a piece of Pomegranate That with Arteriall blood blossom with blushes, That in her Temples yield do spirituall flushes. The Temples where's the purest blood indeed Impregnate with the working Spirits ripe. That Warm and work the Brains as they proceed, Even from the Heart through the Arteriall pipe. Hence modest Looks and head that contemplate The Temples proper exercise and State. The Temples like a piece of Pomegranate Import thy Spirituall Beauty and Spirits high In purest heart blood through th'Arteriall Gate Into the Head. Hence these thy Visage dy Pomegranat like with Ruby blushes Stains And sharpen do thine Eyes with Spirituall Strains. And through thy Temples Silver Wickets go Int' Contemplations Temple brave and there In Spirituall Contemplations labour do On Christs rich Grace, and Glory every where, And how to manage well in Grace's wayes Sin to destroy.

My all Deare Lord, I fain would thee adore But finde my Pen and Inke too faint to do't.

Them thou here thus dost Court saying even thus, Like to a piece of a Choice Pomegranate Thy Temples shine and glaze thy Cheeks that blush, With their Arteriall heart blood, modest state, Whose Vitall heate and Spirits in these pipes Make peart thy Countenance in gracious plites. Th'Arteriall pipes that from thy heart do run Conveigh unto thy Temples the best Cheare Of Hearty Spirits that to thy Temples come, And dy them like a pomegranate looks cleare, And make thy Cheeks to ware a Scarlet Maske Of Modest blushes, on thy Cheeks well dasht. Thy Countenance hence is the Looking Glass Into thy heart wherein in cleare cleare shapes Appear doth Choice Humility that doth pass Most Currant coin in Graces Markets, Mates. These pomegranated Temples exercise A contemplation of a Spirituall Guise. A Spirituall Beauty on the Spouse hence flames Thats Emblemized by the Pomegranate Unto us on the temples by its grains Wearing a scarlet dy upon their Shape All holding out a Spirituall Beauty fresh And Chiefly to Christ's Eye in loveliness. My Lord my Temples pomegranate make thus That I may ware this Holy Modesty Upon my Face maskt with thy Graces blush, That never goes without Humility. Thy lovely object then all grace shall bee Shall Humbly sing forth graces notes to thee. 141. Meditation Cant. 6.8.9.

My Only Dear, Dear Lord, I search to finde My golden Arck of Thought, thoughts fit and store: And search each Till and Drawer of my minde For thoughts full fit to Deck thy kindness o're, But find my foreheade Empty of such thoughts And so my words are simply ragged, nought. Thoughts though the fairest Blossoms of my minde Are things too loose and light t'strew at the gate Of thy bright Palace. My words hence are winde Moulded in print up thee to decorate. Hence th'glory of thy Love Whose Sunshine here I shall but darken with my dusty geere. Hence I do humbly stand, and humbly pray, Thee to accept my homely Style although Its too too hurden a bearing blancket, nay For to lap up thy Love in, it to show. When spruiced up therein, it seems like thatch Upon a golden Palace (Dirty slatch). Thy Love dropt on thy Spouses Loveliness Out measures all Dimention ne'er so wide. Nay Angills pen can't pencill out its dress Nor can its length or breadth ere out describe: They never can thy gloryous Love out lay Whose brightness doth out shine the brightest day. All Virgins in their Virginall Attire: Ladies of Honour eighty in array, And threescore Queens robde shining out like fire Can never match thy Spouses Beauty gay. Though these for Number and for Glory rise In sparkling glory get not to her Sise. Thy boundless Love thy Spouses boundless prove Doth take up all and in't did ever latch. Oh Boundless Loveliness, and boundless Love You neither either ever over match. Yet know this thing, thy Boundless Love hath made This Loveliness thus boundless where its laid. Oh! let thy boundless Love my Lord, a Kiss Bestow on me and joyn me to thy Dove That is but one, Whose members have such Bliss. And in its blissfull beams I'st ever move. My portion then shall far excell the Share Those Queens and Concubines and Virgins weare. If one bright beam of this thy boundless Love Do light on me, enlightend I shall bee To Cooe thy praise as joyned to thy Dove And double back thy Love with songs to thee. Thy Love I'le thus requite with Songs Ile sing Unto thy lovely selfe, under loves Wing. 142. Meditation. Can. 6.9.

Thy Dove all Undefiled doth excell All though but one the onely in thine Eyes All Queen and Concubines that bear the bell. Her excellence all excellency far Transcends as doth the Sun a pinking Star. She is the Onely one her mother bore Jerusalem ever above esteems Her for her Darling her choice one therefore Thou holdst her for the best that ere was seen. The Sweetest Flower in all thy Paradise And she that bore her Made her hers most Choice. That power of thine that made the Heavens bow, And blush with shining glory ever cleare Hath taken her within his glorious brow And made her Madam of his Love most Deare Hath Circled her within his glorious arms Of Love most rich, her shielding from all harms. She is thy Dove, thy Undefiled, she shines In thy rich Righteousness all Lovely, White The onely Choice one of her Mother, thine Most beautifull beloved, thy Delight. The Daughters saw and blessed her, the Queens And Concubines her praisd and her esteem. Thy Love that fills the Heavens brimfull throughout Coms tumbling on her with transcendent bliss Even as it were in golden pipes that spout In Streams from heaven, Oh! what love like this? This comes upon her, hugs her in its Arms And warms her Spirits. Oh! Celestiall Charms. Make me a member of this Spouse of thine I humbly beg deck thus, as Tenis Ball I shall struck hard on th'ground back bounce with Shine Of Praise up to the Chamber floor thy Hall, Possesses.

But still the Wonders stand, shall I looke like The glorious morning that doth gild the Skie With golden beams that make all day grow light And View the World ore with its golden Eye? And shall I rise like fair as the fair Moon, And bright as is the Sun, that lights Each room? When we behold a piece of China Clay Formd up into a China Dish compleat All spiced ore as with gold Sparks display Their beauty all under a glass robe neate, We gaze thereat and wonder rise up will Wondring to see the Chinees art and Skill.

Wonders are nonplust to behold thy Spouse Look forth like to the morning whose sweet rayes Gild ore our Skies as with transparent boughs Like Orient gold of a Celestiall blaze. Fair as the Moon bright as the Sun most cleare Gilding with spirituall gold graces bright Sphere. O Blessed!

And like the fair face of the Moon: whose Cheere Is very brave and like the bright Sun peare, Thus gloriously fitted in brightest Story Of Grace espousd to be the king of glory.

No wonder then and if the Bridesgroom say Thou art all fair my Love, Yea Everyway. May I a member be, my Lord, once made Here of thy Spouse in truest Sence, though it bee The meanest of all, a Toe, or Finger 'rayde Ist have enough of bliss, espousd to thee.

I went down into the Garden of nuts to se the fruits of the Vally, to se whether the Vine flowerished and the Pomegranate Budded. 14.7m [Sept.] 1718. Eternal Majesty, my blessed Lord, Art thou into thy Nutty Garden come? To se the Vallys fruits on thy accord: Whether thy Vines do flowrish and thick hange To se whether thy Pomegranates do bud, And that thy nuttree gardens fruit is good? Am I a grafted Branch in th' true true Vine? Or planted Pomegranat thy Garden in And do I flowerish as a note of Wine? And do my pomegranates now bud and spring? Oh let my blossoms and my Buds turn fruite Lest fruitless I suffer thy prooning Hook. And with thy Spirituall Physick purge thou mee: My very Essence that much fruite't may beare, Most joyous and delightfull unto thee. The Spirituall Grapes and Pomegranates most fare.

If in thy nuttery, I should be found To beare no Nutmegs, Almonds, but a nut All Wormeate, or in barrenness abound I well may feare thy prooning hook will Cut And Cut me off as is the fruitless Vine: That evermore doth fruitfulness decline. But when thou in thy garden dost descend And findst my branch clusterd with spirituall Grapes; And my trees limbs with fruits downward to bend, Each bows full reev'd with Spirituall Pomegranates. My Vines and blossom and the Grapes thereon Will smell indeed like Smell of Lebanon. Shall this poore barren mould of mine e're bee Planted with Spirituall Vines and pomegranates? Whose Bud and Blossome flowrish shall to thee? And with perfumed joys thee graciate? Then Spirituall joyes flying on Spicy Wings Shall entertain thee in thy Visitings. And if thou makest mee to be thy mold Though Clayey mould I bee, and run in mee Thy Spirits Gold, thy Trumpet all of gold, Though I be Clay Ist thy Gold-Trumpet bee.

My Blessed Lord, how doth thy Beautious Spouse In Stately Stature rise in Comliness? With her two breasts like two little Roes that browse Among the lillies in their Shining dress Like stately milke pailes ever full and flow With spirituall milke to make her babes to grow. Celestiall Nectar Wealthier far than Wine Wrought in the Spirits brew house and up tund Within these Vessells which are trust up fine Likend to two pritty neate twin Roes that run'd Most pleasently by their dams sides like Cades And suckle with their milk Christs Spirituall Babes. Lord put these nibbles then my mouth into And suckle me therewith I humbly pray, Then with this milk thy Spirituall Babe I'st grow, And these two milke pails shall themselves display Like to these pritty twins in pairs round neate And shall sing forth thy praise over this meate. 151. Meditation. Cant. 7.4. Thy Neck is like a Tower of Ivory: thine Eyes are like the Fishpools of Heshbon, at the Gate of Bath Rabbim: thy Nose is like the tower of Lebanon that Looketh towards Damascus. 31.8m [Oct.] 1719. My Glorious Lord, how doth the Worlds bright Glory Grow great? Yet loe, thy Spouse doth ware a Shine That far ore shines the Worlds bright Shining Story More than the Sun a glow worms glitter prime. Thy Neck is like a Tower of Ivory White, pure and bright, streight upright, neatly High. Noting thy Pretious Faith which Pillar like Bears up the golden Head: and joyns it to Herselfe thy Body mystick, thy delight: And is the very pipe through which do flow All Vitall Spirits from the head t'revive And make the Bodies members all to thrive. This Neck Compleats thy Spouse, her stately steps, As a Celestiall Majesty Upright Not ry nor Rugged Whight smooth; hath no frets. Thyselfe her Head fix on her neck all White. It never breaks but makes the Spouse a neate And statly person, Body and head compleate. All Spirituall Vitall Influences soaking through They through it drench all its passports, or wayes Though never so secret to each member so And make them grow most gay. This office performs and uniting hold The Head and Body, feet more bright than gold. Her Eyes the fayer glory, the Looking Glass Wherein her minde sees all things shining peep. They are like Heshbon's fish pooles sparkling as The Lymphick Rayments Scally Robes there keep Her cleare clear knowledge in her Spirituall Eye As Viewing things Divine is held thereby. These Fish pools then of Heshbon of rare Art And at Bath Rabbim's gate erected cleare Bright shining do unto us thus impart As they stand at the Rabbins Hall door neer That bright bright Light that doth thy Spouse attend, That doth all Hellish darkness quite dispend. It is the Holy Ghosts bright Lanthorn in Her hand That lights her feet to take the path of Grace And makes the night time daylight. No stop nor stand Hence she hath as she doth to glory trace. The Sun of Righteousness'es beams make day Within, through these and out hence she sees th'right way. Her Nose, the Faces Ornamental Dress Like Lebanon's brave tower, that hath its Eye Upon Damascus which Enemies possess. And smells the actions of Christs Enemy: The Senses and the Neck Eyes, Nose speake beauty bright Being Compleat and Watchfull Weights. And hence these Metaphors we spirituallized Speake out the Spouses spirituall Beauty cleare: And morallizd do speake out Enemies And hence declare the Spouses Lovely deare To be the best and Enemies hath though they Assaulting her shall perish in th'assay. Make me a member of thy Beautious Bride, I then shall wear thy lovely Spouses Shine And shall envest her with my Love beside Which with thy graces shall a dorn her fine. Ist then be deckt up in thy Glorious vests And sing the Bridall Melodies out best. 152. Meditation. Can. 7.5. Thy Head Upon thee is like Carmel and the hair of thy head like Purple. The King is held in the galleries. 27.10m [Dec.] 1719. My Deare Deare Lord! my Soul is damp Untun'd. My strings are fallen and their screw pins slipt. When I should play thy praise each grace perfumd My strings made fit with graces wax most slick. My notes that tune thy praise should, pleasantly, Will onely make an harish symphony. Thou gildest ore with sparkling Metaphors The Object thy Eternall Love fell on Which makes her glory shine 'bove brightest stars Carbuncling of the Skies Pavillion That pave that Crystal Roofe the Earth's Canopy With golden streaks, border'd with Pomell high. The inward Tacles and the outward Traces Shine with the Varnish of the Holy Ghost Are th'Habit and the Exercise of Graces Sent out with glorifying a part an host. Yea every part from leg to toe do shine Or Rather from the toe to th'top Divine. Thus waring of the sparkling shine most bright, Of Sanctifying Grace in every part She is an Object of thy blesst delight That with her beauty doth attack thy heart. Hence in her galleries thou'rt held, thy Eye Detains thyselfe surprised with such joy. Then make me Lord a member of thy Spouse Thus Varnisht with thy spirit, a part of Gold, A Toe, a Foot, a Navill, Nose or brows, An Arm, an Hand, a lock of hair, or fold All sparkling with thy Grace in brightest Rayes And golden Tunes I'l ever singing praise. 153. Meditation. Cant. 7.6. How Fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delight? 12m [Feb.] 1719. My Glorious Lord thy work upon my hand A work so greate and doth so Ample grow Too larg to be by my Souls limits spand. Lord let me to thy Angell Palace goe To borrow thence Angelick Organs bright To play thy praises with these pipes aright. You Holy Angells lend yee mee your Skill. Your Organs set and fill them up well stuft With Christs rich praises whose lips do distill Upon his Spouse such ravishing dews to gust With Silver Metaphors and Tropes bedight. How fair, how pleasant art, Love, for delight? Which Rhetorick of thine my Lord descry Such influences from thy Spouses face That do upon me run and raise thy Joy Above my narrow Fancy to uncase. But yet demands my praise so high, so much The which my narrow pipe can neer tune such. Hence I come to your doors bright Starrs on high And beg you to imply your pipes herein. Winde musick makes the Sweetest Melody. I'le with my little pipe thy praises sing. Accept I pray and what for this I borrow, I'le pay thee more when rise on heavens morrow. 154. Meditation. Heb. 11.6. Without Faith its impossible to please God. 10.5m [July] 1720. Faith! Faith! my Lord! there is none other Grace. Like suitable thyself to grace most High. Of all thy glorious Graces, oh! the place, That Faith obtains 'mongst them to magnify Thyselfe, it is the Golden twist thou hast To tie my Soule to thee my Lord most Fast. That Golden Lace thy Ephod fast to ty Unto thy Glorious Breast plate deckt with Stones Rather the golden Button Curiously Together on thy shouldier bone alone Or golden Girdle that the Breast plate ties Upon thy breast, my Lord, my High Priest wise. Within whose fold these Oracles Divine The Urim and the Thummim doe outshine. Which utter Oracles of shining Light, That shine among the Glittering precious Stones Oucht in their rows upon the Breastplate right Dancing among their sparkling glances known Upon the High Priest, in his rich Robes drest. Stars in his glorious breast plate on his breast. Faith doth ore shine all other Grace set in The Soule that Cabbinet of Grace up fild As far as doth the Shining Sun in'ts run Walking within its golden path ore gild The little pinking Stars playing boe peep. As walking in their Azure room they keep. And though their glorys brave, its borrow Shine And when each doth its glorious glory lay Upon the heap of eachs glory fine That lump thus made's but nighty, makes no day. But when the Sun with its Curld locks out Crowds They blush as shamd and hide out in the Clouds. Even such is Faith amongst these Graces all, It is a grace that doth them grace indeed. It layes a Shine upon their Glory all That further glory hence on them proceed. They in its Glory do more glorious grow. It strengthens and doth nourish them also. Faith is the Curious Girdle that ties to The King of Glory, glorifide with Grace The bundled beams of th'Sun, Gods Son that flow In graces Sunshine on the Soul apace Making their graces all invest them bright In brightest Robes by Faith more light than Light. It is Golden Bosses of Gods Booke that do Clasp it, the soule, to God and seals up fast. The Golden Belt that doth unite also Christ and the Soule together: buckled clasp Christ and the Soule the seal of Grace and brings All grace with't to the Soul Gods praise to sing. 155. Meditation. 2 Cor. 13.5. Examine yourselves whether you be in the Faith; know you not yourselves that Christ is in you except you be reprobats? The 18. of 7m [Sept.] 1720. My blessed Lord, I fain would thee advance But finde my Pen is workd to the very Stumps. My tongue my Speeches tabber Stick can't dance Unto thy prais as I would have it jump. My Drumb Stick thin of Dogtree Wood is made And is unfit to beat thy praises trade. Thou bidst me try if I be in the Faith, For Christ's in me if I bee'nt Reprobate. Thou me dost Check if ignorance displaith Itself in me. And I know not my State. A Reprobate my Lord, let not this come On mee to be the burden of the Song. Grant me thy Spectacles that I may see To glorify aright thy glorious Selfe. And see this Saving Faith grafted in mee. Then thou wilt me inrich with Gospell Wealth. This Faith most Usefull is I ever finde To glorify thyself, of all Grace-kinde. It Usefull is for every Duty here Thou calst us to, and to the Same fit make Its Subject doth, for every prayer most deare And for the Lord's rich Supper to partake. It Oyles indeed the very Wheels of Grace And makes them bravely run aright apace. It is the Grace of Grace begracing all. Usefull for Grace, for Sacraments and Prayer. Religion is without it an empty Call And Zeale without it is a fruitless Care. Preaching without it's as a Magpies Chatter And as a little tittle tattles Clatter. Prayer without Faith is but as prittle pratle. Fasts and Thanksgiving are but barren things And Sacraments without it but as rattles But where this faith is all things gracious spring. What ere it fills it Midas like is 'ts told It Certainly turns into gospell Gold. The Heart that it doth make its Feather Bed It purifies, makes graces Lodgen Roome. It makes th'Tongue tipt with it silver, the Couch orespreds With Gospell Pillows, Sheets, and sweet perfumes And sweetest tunes sings in the Spirit Halls Sweet musick on the Spirits Virginalls. Lord give me Saving Faith and then my Heart Thou'lt make thy gospell golden mine of Grace. Studded with precious Stones in every part Of thy Sweet Spirit gilding ery place. If thou wilt give me this my heart shall sing On'ts Virginall, thy holy praise, within. 156. Meditation Cant. 5.1. Eate oh Friendes and drink yea drink abundantly oh Beloved. The 12.9m [Nov.] 1720. Callst thou me Friend? What Rhetorick is this? It is a Piece of heavenly Blandishments. Can I befriend thee, Lord? Grace dost thou miss Miss name me by such lushous Complements. The Poles may kiss and Parallels meet I trow And Sun the Full moon buss, e're I do so. 'Twould be too much for Speeches Minted Stamp. Sure it would set sweet Grace nigh on the Wrack To assert I could befriend thee and her Cramp. Methinke this tune nigh makes thy Harp Strings crack. Yet Graces note claims kindred nigh this knell Saying Eate Oh Friend, Yea drinke Beloved Well. Friend, and Beloved calld to and welcom'd thus At thy Rich Garden feast with spiced joy. If any else had let such Dainties rush It would be counted sauced blasphemy. But seing Graces Clouds such rain impart, Her Hony fall for joy makes leape my heart. A Friend, yea the best friend that heaven hath Thou art to me; how do thy sweet lips drop Thy Gospell Hony Dews her sky display'th Oh Sweetness such never to be forgot. All Trees of Spices planted in this plot Rich hung with Hony dews that on them dropt. Thou drinkst thy Gardens Syllabub in trine Honide with the drops thy Hony Comb distills. Thou drinkst a Cup to me of't spiced wine And bidst mee pledge thee and I pledge will. My heart top full of these sweet dainties comes Runs over with thy prais in sweetest songs. 157A. Meditation.

How Blest am I having so blesst a Lord If I improve in blessedness a right He loves me so that he doth mee afford A Banquet such that none can make the like. Its not a single meate but certainly It life mentains and that eternally. The sweetest dainties that were ever disht On any Table by Best Cookery In Heavens made.

The sweetest dainties cookt most graciously Is truly spiced Mess And tis the Holy Ghost sweet This is the Banquets Christ The liquour at this table's juyce of the Vine Far richer spirit than the Cana wine. This Drinke here drunk is Zions water red It is the Blood of the Grape that In Gods sweet Vineyard on that noblest The true true Vine; from this press grape What wine is this? it's bled out of Christ's side Tapt by the speare, Doth always best abide.

Meditation on Joh. 1.14. We beheld his Glory as the Glory of the Onely begot Son, full of Grace and Truth. 14.3m [May] 1721. My Deare Deare Lord what shall I render thee? Words spoken are but breesing boxed Winde. If written onely inked paper bee. Unless truth mantle, they bely the minde. Is this sylabicated jumble whist Out of my pen, for thee fit meed by my fist? My deare dear Lord, thou king of Gloriousness, Who can sufficiently thyself admire? The Heavens themselves cannot the same express. It then their Covering ascends still Higher. Nor can the Heavens e're thy glory hold. Its brightness doth exceed all pearls, and Gold. I fain would give thee all my Love and all Its Cabbinet wherein it keeps its Case. My heart with it, yea, and myselfe too shall Go with it to thee, that in holy chase Is all too foule and small a thing for thee. Yet I no better finde to furnish mee. If thus my Love dresst with the Quintessence Of its choice Faith and dear affection, Extract by thy Spirits Chymistry, Expence Being for this thing this rich Ejection 'Twould be onely Sweate of thy drops of Grace Upon my heart, thus trickling down my face. These Spirits of Love with th'Quintesses pure Of all th'affection never could the Eye Ever behold thy Glory, nor endure To look upon it without dazling joy. Thy beaming Glory falling on its Sight Would make its Vision darke as dark as night. Thy Glory Lord all other glory blinds. The glory of thy Nature pure Divine. The glory that thy Human Nature joyns, Out shines all mortall glory that doth shine. Thy Persons glory makes all others Smutt And seem to it but like to Chimny Sut. The Glory of thy Human birth, by right Did make an Host of glorious Angells sing. And all their spirituall instruments and pipes Melodiously tune praises to our King. Thus when God brought his First born Son to light He said ye Angells Worship him aright. Thy glory shone through ery step thou tookst And did attend each word dropt from thy tongue. Thy Doctrine did shine out thy life like shoots And glorious miracles were along With this life full cleare And made the actions of thy life bright here. The glory of thy powerfull words did make The fiends of hell to tremble and to fly. And made their stoughtest blades their hearts to quake. And turn away their feet, and out to cry. The wind and Sea amaizd stand still. Divills shrinke. The Sun within the Skies hereby's made blinke. The Grave is gilded where thy body lay Even with thy glory. That Sting of death puld out. The Earth a dancing fell when thy bright day Of its uprising shining all about Angells put on their glorious robes to tend Thy tryumph over death and as thy freinds. And still to make our Happiness compleate Thou art top full of Grace and truth Wherby The Object art of Intellects the Seate In us and of our Wills, therein to 'ploy. Themselves in truth and Goodness at thy Will These Faculties with happiness, to th'fill. Then thou upon the Wings of Glories Beams Ridst through the realm of th'Enemies; the Skies: Unto thy throne of Glorys brightest Streams And hosts of Sparkling Angells glorious wise. And whilst thy Captives thou dost Captive bring The Heavens thy Triumphant glory sing. Such glory ne'er seen under the Canopy The Copes of Heaven these golden letters savour This truth, we saw his Glory gloriously As th'glory of th'onely Son of th'Father. Lord ope mine eyes to se thy glory bright And tune thy praise in beams of glorious light. 159. Meditation Rev. 3.10. He that over comes will I give to eat of the Hidden Mannah. 8m [Oct.] 1722. Pardon my Lord, this is my great request. For that thy Table of such Spirituall Cheere Hath been by me so long a time undresst My tenderness to the Offender were A cause of this long intermission Yet it at length producde Confession. And now dear Lord, I do return thee praise For such forbearance and such Victory Over the powers of darkness, that did raise The storm to blow the Candle out thereby But Faith that gains the Conquest over hell Hath here tryumphd. And born away the bell. Thou saist thou'lt feed with hidden Mannah them That in the spiritual Combate overcom. Give mee I pray this Conquouring Faith and then I'le sing a Tryumph: it shall be my song. I honour will my Captain, sing his praise Who leads me on and in my song him grace. He in the War knows well us to Command. The word is very ready in his lip. He leads us on, when weary bids us stand. Lets not us fall, although we've many a slipp. He gives us Heart a grace, come on brave boys I'le give you Angells, Dainties, heavenly joyes. He'l feast us now with such a feast as made George Nevills Feast although prodigeous 't were With dainties, things all fat and trade Was but like th'indian broths of Garbag'd deer With which the Netop entertain his guests When almost starv'd, yea Welcome Sir, its our Mess. Ahashuerus his banquet long and linde And larded too with fatness and the Choicest Wine, Was but a little milk wash it lin'd To be compar'd to this that's all divine. It is a feast so sweet, so taking flavour, That make the very Angells mouths to water. The Table, Benches Chairs and Cushens and Their Table cloaths and Napkins all of Grace The drinking Cups and Trenchers all at hand, Gold hath no market for this feasting place. The Guests are Saints, the Waiters Angells are The Entertainment Mannah. Angells fare. The Drinking Glass is of Sapharin full of Grace. The Pasty past is of the Wheat of Heaven. The Holy Ghost managed the Cooke choice place The Venison its filld with free from Leaven Was taken in Gods parke and dresst, but where By Whom it matter not, its Choicest cheare. Minced pies most choise spic'd with the richest spice Enriched with the Wealthi'st wine indeed And plumbt with raisins, those of Paradise Our Mannah thus prepar'd lets now proceed. Lord make me then to overcome I 'treat. Then thou will give mee hid'n mannah t'eate. 160. Meditation Cant. 2.1. I am the Lilly of the Vallie. Westfield 22.10m [Dec.] 1722. My Lord my Love I want words fit for thee. And if't were otherwise, affections want To animate the words that they might bee A mantle to send praise to praises camp But want I word and Spirits for the Same; If I omit thy praise I sure have blame. Lord make my heart in mee an humble thing The humble hearts thy Habitation bright. Its fatted then by thee and thou therein Enrich it will with thy Celestiall Light. Thyselfe, dear Lord, shall be its gloryous Shine Wherewith it shall adorned be and fine. I being thus, become thy Vallie low. O plant thyselfe my lilly flower there. Sure then my lilly in it up will grow In beauty. And its fragrancy will fleer. My heart thy spirituall valie all divine Thyselfe the lilly of the Vally thine. I am thy Vally where thy lilly grows Thou my White and Red blesst lilly fresh; Thy Active and thy Passive 'bedience do Hold out Active and Passive Right'ousness. Pure White and Red making a lovely grace, Present thee to our Love to hug and 'brace. The Medicinall Virtue of the lilly speake That thou my Lilly are Physician who Healst all Diseased Souls both small and greate. None dy of any Spirituall Sores that to thee goe. The Vally lilly then doth Emblemize Thy fitness for thy Mediatoriall guise. Shall Heaven itselfe with all its glorious flowers Stick them as feathers in thy Cap my king And in this glory bow to plant in, power Them as a lilly flower my Vally in, Which is not onely deepe but durty too, What wonders this? What praise and thanks hence due? But oh! alas my pin box is too small To hold praise meet for such praiseworthiness. The Angells and Archangells in Gods hall Mee your Shoshannim tend then to adress My Lord with praises bright in highest tunes And though they are Stuttings they are sweet perfumes. If thou the Lilly of my Vally bee My Vally shall then glorious be and shine Allthough it be a barren Soile for thee: The Lilly of my Vally is divine. I'le borrow heavenly praise for thee my king To sacrifice to thee on my Harps sweet string. 161A. Meditation. Cant. 2.3. As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. Westfield 12m 3 day [Feb.] 1722. My double Dear Lord, and doubl't ore and ore Ten thousand times it would indeed still rise A bubbe too small to knock at thy blesst doore Of Loveliness, ten thousand times to thy sise. It would be a gift ten thousand times too low Though 't is the best I have on thee to bestow. My Love alas is but a shrimpy thing A sorry Crickling a blasted bud A little drachm, too light a gift to bring. Its but a grain weight and scarce ever good, And shall I then presume thee to obtain If I should rob thee of so small a grain. Thou art as Apple tree 'mong sons of man As was the Apple tree amonge the trees That many are, (the Worlds geese are white swans In its account.) but thou excellest all these Ten thousand times bearing on every limb All golden apples; ripest grace that springs. Not like the tree that once in Eden grew Amongst whose fruits the serpent old soon lops And in his very teeth the poison threw Into our Mother Eves her sorry Chops. Nor like the Serpents Egge the Squerill held Secur'd itselfe from th'venom that on it fell. Lord shake their bower and let these apples fall Into my Wicker basket and it fill. Then I shall have rich spirituall food for all Occasions as they essences do still And I shall feed on their rich grace my fare As they drop from thy Apple tree most rare. And as thou serv'st up in thy Charger bright A messe of these rich apples, sweet imbrace I tasting them do in their reech delight And over them will surely sing thee grace. Thou tree of Life that ever more dost stand Within the Paradise of God and hast The Promise to him gi'n whose happy hand Doth overcome, shall of it eate and tast. Lord feed mee with this promisd food of Life And I will sing thy praise in songs most rife. 161B. Meditation Cant. 2.3. As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. Westfield 22.3m [May] 1723. My double Deare Lord, yea doubld ore and ore Ten thousand times, it would indeed still rise Too little for to knock at thy blesst doore Of Loveliness ten thousand times its sise. 'Twould be a gift ten thousand times too small For my poor love to honour thee withall. My Love alas is a small shrivled thing A little Crickling a blasted bud, Scarce a grain in weight that can't unto thee bring Scarce lump nor give And shall I then presume therewith to greet The precious jewells that adorn thy feet? Thou as the Apple tree, in wood dost rise Even such among the Sons and them Excellst The world in envy's eyes But thou these White thou tellst, Twould this gold Martyre relats in's streams indeed its but golden dreams. Not like the tree that once in Eden grew Out of whose bows th'old serpent drops Into our Mother Eve's lap the apple threw The which she quickly mumbled in her Chops. That tree of Life god's Paradise within That healing fruite brings froth to heale 'gainst sin. Its better far then was the snakes eges found By the poore squerrell, and did arm itselfe Therewith held in its teeth when th'Snake did round Assault it who held them unto this Elfe. She tendered the Eggs held in its mouth strange fate And so repelld away the Rattle Snake. Oh! Shake the tree and make these apples fall Into my Wicker Basket oh how free Art thou my Apple tree, surpassing all Then spirituall Food and Physick, curing mee. Then I shall have rich spirituall Balms, once had The Balm of Gilliad to make me glad. Lord serve up in thy Saphire Charger bright A service of these golden Apples brave Whose sight and sent will fill me with delight As they come tumbling Wave, My food will Food and Med'cine to mee bee Which Grace itselfe cooks up aright for mee. Thou tree of Life yea life erelasting stand Within the Paradise of God thou hast That promisd them that hath that happy hand As to overcome shall Eating of it tast. Lord send me with this promisd branch of Life And I will sing thy Grace with gracious strife. 162. Meditation Cant. 2.3. I sat under his shadow with greate delight and his fruit was sweet to my taste. Westfield 31.12m [Feb.] 1723. A shadow, Lord, not such as types show here Nor such as Titerus his broad Beech made In which he with his Oat straw pipe't there A Forrest march, such his dark blackish trade. But tis a milke white Shadow sparkling bright That doth excell all excellent delight. It doth delight the Saints in glorious wise As shadow of a rock in weary land. It doth revive them when the Clouds arise And maske the brows of heaven's bright shining hand. Grace gilds this shade with brightsom shines Godward And manward doth bring a blest reward. A Shadow not a scowling cloud that rose Big belli'd with hard Cracks of frightful thunder And rapid frightful firy flashes throws A with horrid rending thunder Making the hinds to calve and Lebanon To skip like to a frighted Unicorn. A shade indeed did hap cluster of bright Angells up Made a Brave feather to adorn the Cap Upon the Tabernakles By Day and Night the Camp as on they stand Through the Wilderness to the promisd land. Lord let this shadow as a Canopy Catch all perfumes that from the Earth arise in to fill My drinking cup when squezd I shall it prize. Then when my Crystall Cup grows full to the brim Thy praise sweet to my tast my harp shall sing. 163. Meditation Cant. 2.3. His fruit was Sweet to my Tast. Sweet Lord, all sweet from top to bottom all From Heart to hide, sweet, mostly sweet. Sweet Manhood and sweet Godhead and ere shall. Thou art the best of Sweeting. And so keep. Thou art made up of best of sweetness brast. Thy Fruit is ever sweet unto my tast. Thou art my sweetest one, my Onely sweet. From kirnel to the rinde, all sweet to mee. Thy bitterness is sweet: no choaking reech Nor damping Steams arise to damp from thee The Sacred Spices. Muske them Are unto thee, sweet, like to faded gum. Thou unto mee art onely sweet all sweet Sweet in the Virgin wombe and horses Manger. Sweet in thy swath band and thy Childhood meete Yea, sweet to all, to neighbour and to Stranger. Sweet in thy Life and Conversation, friends. Thy Sweetness dropest from thy fingers Ends. My Lord, my Love, my Lilly, my Rose and Crown My brightest Glory, and my Hony sweet My Happiness, my Riches, my Renown. My Shade for Comfort, in thee good things meet. Not one thing in thee that admits of Spot All Heavens Scutchen, and a bright Love knot. Heavens Carnation with most sweet perfume, Pinkes, Roses, Violets that perfume the Aire Inchant the Eyes and fancy in their bloome Entoxicate the Fancy with their Ware That fuddled, turne and reele and tumble down From holly sweet to Earthly damps like Clowns. It gathers not the Lillys nor doth Picke This double sweet rose in Zions Rose tree breede Nor climbs this Apple tree, nor doth it sit At all in'ts Shade, nor on its Apple feed. Its lost within the fog and goes astray Like to a fuddled person out of's way. But Oh! my Lord, how sweet art thou to mee In all thy Mediatoriall actions sweet Most sweet in thy Redemtion all way free Thy Righteousness, thy holiness most meeke. In Reconciliation made for mee With God offended in the highst degree. A Cabbinet of Holiness, Civit box Of Heavenly Aromatick, still much more, A treasury of Spicery, rich knots, Of Choicest Merigolds, a house of Store Of never failing dainties to my tast Delighting holy Palates, such thou hast. A sugar Mill, an Hony Hive most rich Of all Celestial viands, golden box Top full of Saving Grace, a Mint house which Is full of Angells, and a cloud that drops Down better fare than ever Artist could, More pleasant than the finest liquid Gold. Then glut me Lord, ev'n on this dainty fare, Here is not Surfeit; look upon this dish: All is too little to suffice, this fare Can surfeit none that eatest; none eate amiss, Unless they eat too little. So disgrace The preparation of the banquit place. While I sat longing in this Shadow here To tast the fruite this Apple tree all ripe How sweet these Sweetings bee. Oh! sweet good Cheere How am I filld with sweet most sweet delight. The fruite, while I was in its shady place Was and to mee is now sweet to my tast. 164. Meditation Cant. 2.4. He brought mee into his Banqueting house (house of Wine) and his banner over me was love. Month 6th [Aug.] Anno 1723. Words are Dear Lord, notes insignificant But Curled aire when spoke Sedan'd from the Lip Into the Eare, soon vanish, though don't Cant, Yea run on tiptoe, and hence often trip Sometimes do poother out like th'Chimny Smoake Hence often smut the matter, and nigh Choake. Hence, my Dear Lord, the mantle I would make Thee, I do feare will run all Counter buffe, To my design, and streakt be like a Snake, That's new crept out of 'ts garment, a slunk Slough, Or have a smoaky Smell, and Choaky lodge Within its Clasp. And so it proove a blodge. But, oh Dear Lord, though my pen pikes no gold To lace these robes with, I would dress thee in And its a Shame that Tinsyl ribbon should Be all the trimming that I own to bring Yet seeing, Lord, my shop board hath no better, I do presume thou'lt take it of thy debtor. Thou hast me brought into thy house of Wine, The Saphire Caske of thy rich precepts And thy Carbunkled Firkins tappt divine And Choicest Nectar in Sweet Promises. When thou hath Thy sweetest praise my Muse shall melodiously out sing. 165. Meditation. Cant. 2.5. I am sick of Love. Month 8 [Oct.] 1725. Heart sick my Lord heart sick of Love to thee! pain'd in Love oh see Its parchments ready to crack, it was so free. It so affects true love As taken sends my Lords pledge But seeing its so small and hence not fledge, It hates confinement, can't confine its Love It sends to thee, disdains an Hidebound gift. But ever doth esteem great Love to move Unto thyself my Lord, from all else rifts All hatcht in heaven of an heavenly Egge The Holy Ghost layd there in'ts feather bed. If it be hatcht in Heaven, and thence brought Back in the bill of th'brightest Angel there My heart would feare it was but stolen, and caught Thence and me given, unfit for thee most deare. The Holy Spirits Egg hatcht in this nest Would onely bee a gift, of Gifts the best. I do bewaile my heart hath little of this Thee to assail therewith, but oh the Smell Of such a gift, that thou art pleast with, yes. Hence hope there's Something in't will please thee well. Hence Lord accept of this, reject the rest. I grudg my heart if it send not thee th'best. Had I but better thou shouldst better have. I nought withold from thee through nigerdliness, But better than my best I cannot save From any one, but bring my best to thee. If thou acceptst my sick Loves gift I bring Thy it accepting makes my sick Love sing. Gods Determinations touching his Elect: and The Elects Combat in their Conversion, and Coming up to God in Christ together with the Comfortable Effects thereof. The Preface. Infinity, when all things it beheld In Nothing, and of Nothing all did build, Upon what Base was fixt the Lath, wherein He turn'd this Globe, and riggalld it so trim? Who blew the Bellows of his Furnace Vast? Or held the Mould wherein the world was Cast? Who laid its Corner Stone? Or whose Command? Where stand the Pillars upon which it stands? Who Lac'de and Fillitted the earth so fine, With Rivers like green Ribbons Smaragdine? Who made the Sea's its Selvedge, and it locks Like a Quilt Ball within a Silver Box? Who Spread its Canopy? Or Curtains Spun? Who in this Bowling Alley bowld the Sun? Who made it always when it rises set To go at once both down, and up to get? Who th'Curtain rods made for this Tapistry? Who hung the twinckling Lanthorns in the Sky? Who? who did this? or who is he? Why, know Its Onely Might Almighty this did doe. His hand hath made this noble worke which Stands His Glorious Handywork not made by hands. Who spake all things from nothing; and with ease Can speake all things to nothing, if he please. Whose Little finger at his pleasure Can Out mete ten thousand worlds with halfe a Span: Whose Might Almighty can by half a looks Root up the rocks and rock the hills by th'roots. Can take this mighty World up in his hande, And shake it like a Squitchen or a Wand. Whose single Frown will make the Heavens shake Like as an aspen leafe the Winde makes quake. Oh! what a might is this Whose single frown Doth shake the world as it would shake it down? Which All from Nothing fet, from Nothing, All: Hath All on Nothing set, lets Nothing fall. Gave All to nothing Man indeed, whereby Through nothing man all might him Glorify. In Nothing then imbosst the brightest Gem More pretious than all pretiousness in them. But Nothing man did throw down all by Sin: And darkened that lightsom Gem in him. That now his Brightest Diamond is grown Darker by far than any Coalpit Stone. The Effects of Mans Apostacy. While man unmarr'd abode his Spirits all In Vivid hue were active in their hall, This Spotless Body, here and there mentain Their traffick for the Universall gain. Till Sin Beat up for Volunteers. Whence came A thousand Griefs attending on the same. Which march in ranck, and file, proceed to make A Battery, and the fort of Life to take. Which when the Centinalls did spy, the Heart Did beate alarum up in every part. The Vitall Spirits apprehend thereby Exposde to danger great the suburbs ly, The which they do desert, and speedily The Fort of Life the Heart, they Fortify. The Heart beats up still by her Pulse to Call Out of the outworks her train Souldiers all Which quickly come hence: now the Looks grow pale Limbs feeble too: the Enemies prevaile. Do scale the Outworks where there's Scarce a Scoute That can be Spi'de sent from the Castle out. Man at a muze, and in a maze doth stand, While Feare the Generall of all the Band Makes inroads on him: then he Searches why, And quickly Findes God stand as Enemy. Whom he would fain subdue, yet Fears affright In Varnishing their Weapons in his Sight. Troops after troops, Bands after Bands do high, Armies of armed terrours drawing nigh: He lookes within, and sad amazement's there, Without, and all things fly about his Eares. Above, and sees Heaven falling on his pate, Below and spies th'Infernall burning lake, Before and sees God storming in his Face, Behinde, and spies Vengeance persues his trace. To stay he dares not, go he knows not where From God he can't, to God he dreads for Feare. To Dy he Dreads; For Vengeance's due to him; To Live he must not, Death persues his Sin: He Knows not what to have, nor what to loose Nor what to do, nor what to take or Choose: Thus over Stretcht upon the Wrack of Woe, Bereav'd of Reason, he proceeds now so, Betakes himself unto his Heels in hast, Runs like a Madman till his Spirits wast, Then like a Child that fears the Poker Clapp Him on his face doth on his Mothers lap Doth hold his breath, lies still for fear least hee Should by his breathing lowd discover'd bee. Thus on his face doth see no outward thing But still his heart for Feare doth pant within. Doth make its Drummer beate so loud it makes The Very Bulworks of the City Quake: Yet gets no aide: Wherefore the Spirits they Are ready all to leave, and run away. For Nature in this Pannick feare scarce gives Him life enough, to let him feel he lives. Yet this he easily feels, he liveth in A Dying Life, and Living Death by Sin, Yet in this Lifeless life wherein he lies, Some Figments of Excuses doth devise That he may Something say, when rain'd, although His Say seems nothing, and for nought will go. But while he Sculking on his face close lies Espying nought, the Eye Divine him spies. Justice and Mercy then fall to debate Concerning this poore fallen mans estate, Before the Bench of the Almighties Breast Th' ensuing Dialogues hint their Contest. A Dialogue between Justice and Mercy. Offended Justice comes in fiery Rage, Like to a Rampant Lyon new assaild, Array'd in Flaming fire now to engage, With red hot burning Wrath poore man unbaild. In whose Dread Vissage sinfull man may spy Confounding, Rending, Flaming Majesty. Out Rebell, out (saith Justice) to the Wrack, Which every joynt unjoynts, doth streatch, and strain, Where Sinews tortur'de are untill they Crack And Flesh is torn asunder grain by grain. What Spit thy Venom in my Face! Come out To handy gripes seing thou art so stoute. Mercy takes up the Challenge, Comes as meeke As any Lamb, on mans behalfe, she speakes Like new blown pincks, breaths out perfumed reech And doth revive the heart before it breaks. Justice (saith Mercy) if thou Storm so fast, Man is but dust that flies before thy blast. JUSTICE My Essence is ingag'de, I cannot bate, Justice not done no Justice is; and hence I cannot hold off of the Rebells pate The Vengeance he halls down with Violence. If Justice wronged be she must revenge: Unless a way be found to make all friends. MERCY My Essence is engag'de pitty to show. Mercy not done no Mercy is. And hence I'le put my shoulders to the burden so Halld on his head with hands of Violence. As Justice justice evermore must doe: So Mercy Mercy evermore must show. JUSTICE I'le take thy Bond: But know thou this must doe. Thou from thy Fathers bosom must depart: And be incarnate like a slave below Must pay mans Debts unto the utmost marke. Thou must sustain that burden, that will make The Angells sink into th' Infernall lake. Nay on thy shoulders bare must beare the smart Which makes the Stoutest Angell buckling cry Nay makes thy Soule to Cry through griefe of heart, eli, eli, lama sabachtani. If this thou wilt, come then, and do not spare. Beare up the Burden on thy Shoulders bare. MERCY All this I'le do, and do it o're and o're, Before my Clients Case shall ever faile. I'le pay his Debt, and wipe out all his Score And till the pay day Come I'le be his baile. I Heaven, and Earth do on my shoulders beare, Yet down I'le throw them all rather than Spare. JUSTICE Yet notwithstanding still this is too Small, Although there was a thousand times more done. If sinless man did, sinfull man will fall: If out of debt, will on a new score run. Then stand away, and let me strike at first: For better now, than when he's at the Worst. MERCY If more a thousand times too little bee Ten thousand times yet more than this I'le do: I'le free him from his Sin, and Set him free From all those faults the which he's subject to. Then Stand away, and strike not at the first. He'l better grow when he is at the worst. JUSTICE Nay, this ten thousand times as much can still Confer no hony to the Sinners hive. For man though shrived throughly from all ill His Righteousness is merely negative. Though none be damnd but such as sin imbrace: Yet none are sav'd without Inherent Grace. MERCY What, though ten thousand times, too little bee? I will ten thousand thousand times more do. I will not onely from his sin him free, But fill him with Inherent grace also. Though none are Sav'd that wickedness imbrace. Yet none are Damn'd that have Inherent Grace. JUSTICE Yet this ten thousand thousand times more shall, Though Doubled o're, and o're for little stands. The Righteousness of God should be his all The which he cannot have for want of hands. Then though he's spar'de at first, at last he'l fall For want of hands to hold himselfe withall. MERCY Though this ten thousand thousand times much more Though doubled o're and o're for little go, I'le double still its double o're and ore And trible that untill I make it do. I'le make him hands of Faith to hold full fast. Spare him at first, then he'l not fall at last. For by these hands he'l lay his Sins Upon The Scape Goats head, o're whom he shall Confess And with these hands he rightly shall put on My milkwhite Robe of Lovely Righteousness. Now Justice on, thy Will fulfilled bee. Thou dost no wrong: the Sinner's just like thee. JUSTICE If so, its so: then I'l his Quittance seale: Or shall accuse myselfe as well as him: If so, I Justice shall of Justice faile Which if I do, Justice herselfe should sin. Justice unspotted is, and therefore must, MERCY I do foresee Proud man will me abuse, He'th broke his Legs, yets Legs his stilts must bee: And I may stand untill the Chilly Dews Do pearle my Locks before he'l stand on mee. For set a Beggar upon horseback, see He'll ride as if no man so good as hee. JUSTICE And I foresee Proude man will me abuse. Judging his Shekel is the Sanctuaries: He on his durty stilts to walk will Choose: Yea is as Clean as I, and nothing Varies Although his Shekel is not Silver good And's tilting stilts do stick within the mudd. MERCY But most he'l me abuse, I feare, for still Some will have Farms to farm, some wives to wed: Some beasts to buy; and I must waite their Will. Though while they scrape their naile, or scratch their head Nay though with Cap in hand I Wooe them long They'l whistle out their Whistle e're they'l come. JUSTICE I see I'st be abus'de by greate, and small: And most will count me blinde, or will not see: Me leaden heel'd, with iron hands they'l Call: Or am unjust, or they more just than mee. And while they while away their Mercy so, They set their bristles up at Justice do. MERCY I feare the Humble Soul will be too shie; Judging my Mercy lesser than his Sin. Inlarging this, but lessening that thereby. 'S if Mercy would not Mercy be to him. Alas! poore Heart! how art thou damnifide, By Proud Humility, and Humble Pride? JUSTICE The Humble Soul deales worse with me, doth Cry If I be just, I'le on him Vengeance take As if I su'de Debtor, and Surety And double Debt and intrest too would rake. If Justice sue the Bonds that Cancelld are Sue Justice then before a juster bar. MERCY But in this Case alas, what must be done That haughty souls may humble be, and low? That Humble souls may suck the Hony Comb? And thou for Justice, I for Mercy go? This Query weighty is, Lets therefore shew What must be done herein by me, and you. JUSTICE Lest that the Soule in Sin securely ly, And do neglect Free Grace, I'le steping in Convince him by the Morall Law, whereby Ile'st se in what a pickle he is in. For all he hath, for nothing stand it shall If of the Law one hair breadth short it fall. MERCY And lest the Soule should quite discourag'de stand I will step in, and smile him in the face, Nay I to him will hold out in my hand The golden scepter of my Rich-Rich Grace. Intreating him with smiling lips most cleare At Court of Justice in my robes t'appeare. JUSTICE If any after Satans Pipes do Caper Red burning Coales from hell in Wrath I gripe, And make them in his face with Vengeance Vaper, Untill he dance after the Gospell Pipe. Whose Sun is Sin, when Sin in Sorrows shrow'd, Their Sun of Joy sets in a grievous Cloud. MERCY When any such are startled from ill, And cry help, help, with tears, I will advance The Musick of the Gospell Minsterill, Whose strokes they strike, and tunes exactly dance. Who mourn when Justice frowns, when Mercie playes Will to her sounding Viall Chant out Praise. JUSTICE The Works of Merit-Mongers I will weigh Within the Ballance of the sanctuary: Their Matter, and their Manner I will lay Unto the Standard-Rule t'see how they Vary. Whosever trust doth to his golden deed Doth rob a barren Garden for a Weed. MERCY Yet if they'l onely on my Merits trust They'st in Gods Paradise themselves solace, Their beauteous garden knot I'le also thrust With Royall Slips, Sweet Flowers, and Herbs of Grace. Their Knots I'le weed, to give a spangling show In Order: and perfumes shall from them flow. JUSTICE Those that are ignorant, and do not know What meaneth Sin, nor what means Sanctity, I will Convince that all save Saints must go Into hot fire, and brimston there to fry. Whose Pains hot scalding boyling Lead transcends, But evermore adds more and never Ends. MERCY Though simple, learn of mee. I will you teach, True Wisdom for your Souls Felicity, Wisdom Extending to the Endless reach And blissfull end of all Eternity. Wisdom that doth all else transcend as far As Sol's bright Glory doth a painted Star. JUSTICE You that Extenuate your sins, come see Them in Gods multiplying Glass: for here Your little sins will just like mountains bee, And as they are just so they Will appeare. Who doth a little sin Extenuate Extends the same, and two thereof doth make. MERCY A little sin is sin: and is Sin Small? Excuse it not, but aggrivate it more. Lest that your little Sin asunder fall And two become, each bigger than before. Who scants his sin will scarce get grace to save. For little Sins, but little pardons have. JUSTICE Unto the Humble Humble Soule I say, Cheer up, poor Heart, for satisfi'de am I. For Justice nothing to thy Charge can lay, Thou hast Acquittance in thy surety. The Court of Justice thee acquits: therefore Thou to the Court of Mercy are bound o're. MERCY My Dove, come hither linger not, nor stay. Though thou among the pots hast lain, behold Thy Wings with Silver Colours I'le o're lay: And lay thy feathers o're with yellow gold. Justice in Justice must adjudge thee just: If thou in Mercies Mercy put thy trust. Mans Perplexity when calld to an account. Justice, and Mercy ending their Contest, In such a sort, now thrust away the Desk. And other titles come in Majesty, All to attend Almighty royally. Which sparkle out, call man to come and tell How he his Cloath defild and how he fell? He on his skirts with Guilt, and Filth out peeps With Pallid Pannick Fear upon his Cheeks, With Trembling joynts, and Quiverring Lips, doth quake As if each Word he was about to make, Should hackt a sunder be, and Chopt as small As Pot herbs for the pot before they Call Upon the Understanding to draw neer, By tabbering on the Drum within the eare. His Spirits are so low they'l scarce afford Him Winde enough to wast a single word Over the Tongue unto one's eare: yet loe, This tale at last with sobs, and sighs lets goe, Saying, my Mate procurde me all this hurt, Who threw me in my best Cloaths in the Dirt. Thus man hath lost his Freehold by his ill: Now to his Land Lord tenent is at Will. And must the Tenement keep in repare Whate're the ruins, and the Charges are. Nay, and must mannage war against his Foes. Although ten thousand strong, he must oppose. Some seeming Friends prove secret foes, which will Thrust Fire i'th'thatch, nay stob, Cut throate and kill. Some undermine the Walls: Some knock them down, And make them tumble on the Tenents Crown. He's then turnd out of Doors, and so must stay, Till's house be rais'd against the Reckoning day. Gods Selecting Love in the Decree. Man in this Lapst Estate at very best, A Cripple is and footsore, sore opprest, Can't track Gods Trace but Pains, and pritches prick Like poyson'd splinters sticking in the Quick. Yet jims in th'Downy path with pleasures spread As 'twas below him on the Earth to tread. Can prance, and trip within the way of Sin, Yet in Gods path moves not a little wing. Almighty this foreseing, and withall That all this stately worke of his would fall Tumble, and Dash to pieces Did in lay Before it was too late for it a Stay. Doth with his hands hold, and uphold the same. Hence his Eternall Purpose doth proclaim. Whereby transcendently he makes to shine Transplendent Glory in his Grace Divine. Almighty makes a mighty sumptuous feast: Doth make the Sinfull Sons of men his guests. But yet in speciall Grace he hath to some, (Because they Cripples are, and Cannot come) He sends a Royall Coach forth for the same, To fetch them in, and names them name by name. A Royall Coach whose scarlet Canopy O're silver Pillars, doth expanded ly: All bottomed with purest gold refin'de, And inside o're with lovely Love all linde. Which Coach indeed you may exactly spy All mankinde splits in a Dicotomy. For all ride to the feast that favour finde. The rest do slite the Call and stay behinde. O! Honour! Honour! Honours! Oh! the Gain! And all such Honours all the saints obtain. It is the Chariot of the King of Kings: That all who Glory gain, to glory brings. Whose Glory makes the rest, (when spi'de) beg in. Some gaze and stare. Some stranging at the thing. Some peep therein; some rage thereat, but all, Like market people seing on a stall, Some rare Commodity Clap hands thereon And Cheapen't hastily, but soon are gone. For hearing of the price, and wanting pay Do pish thereat, and Coily pass away. So hearing of the terms, whist, they'le abide At home before they'l pay so much to ride. But they to whom its sent had rather all, Dy in this Coach, than let their journey fall. They up therefore do get, and in it ride Unto Eternal bliss, while down the tide The other scull unto eternall woe; By letting slip their former journey so. For when they finde the Silver Pillars fair The Golden bottom pav'de with Love as rare, To be the Spirits sumptuous building cleare, When in the Soul his Temple he doth reare And Purple Canopy to bee (they spy) All Graces Needlework and Huswifry; Their stomachs rise: these graces will not down. They think them Slobber Sawces: therefore frown. They loath the same, wamble keck, heave they do: Their Spleen thereat out at their mouths they throw, Which while they do, the Coach away doth high Wheeling the Saints in't to eternall joy. These therefore and their journey now do come For to be treated on, and Coacht along. The Frowardness of the Elect in the Work of Conversion. Those upon whom Almighty doth intend His all Eternall Glory to expend, Lulld in the lap of sinfull Nature snugg, Like Pearls in Puddles cover'd ore with mudd: Whom, if you search, perhaps some few you'l finde, That to notorious Sins were ne're inclinde. Some shunning some, some most, some greate, some small. Some this, that or the other, some none at all. But all, or almost all you'st easly finde, To all, or almost all Defects inclinde To Revell with the Rabble rout who say Let's hiss this Piety out of our Day. And those whose frame is made of finer twine Stand further off from Grace than Wash from Wine. Those who suck Grace from th'breast, are nigh as rare As Black Swans that in milkwhite Rivers are. Grace therefore calls them all, and sweetly wooes. Some won come in, the rest as yet refuse, And run away: Mercy persues apace, Then some Cast down their arms, Cry Quarter, Grace. Some Chased out of breath drop down with feare Perceiving the persuer drawing neer. The rest persude, divide into two rancks And this way one, and that the other prancks. Then in comes Justice with her forces by her, And doth persue as hot as sparkling fire. The right wing then begins to fly away. But in the streights strong Baracadoes lay. They're therefore forc'd to face about, and have Their spirits Queld, and therefore Quarter Crave. These Captivde thus: justice persues the Game With all her troops to take the other train. Which being Chast in a Peninsula And followd close, they finde no other way To make escape, but t'rally round about: Which if it faile them that they get not out, They're forct into the Infernall Gulfe alive Or hackt in pieces are or took Captive. But spying Mercy stand with Justice, they Cast down their Weapons, and for Quarter pray. Their lives are therefore spar'de, yet they are ta'ne As th'other band: and prisoners must remain. And so they must now Justice's Captives bee On Mercies Quarrell: Mercy sets not free. Their former Captain is their Deadly foe. And now, poor souls, they know not what to do. Satans Rage at them in their Conversion. Grace by the Aide of Justice wins the day. And Satans Captives Captives leads away, Who finding of their former Captains Cheates, To be Rebellion, him a Rebell Greate, Against his Rightfull Sovereign, by whom He shortly shall to Execution Come, They sue for Pardon do at Mercies Doore Bewailing of that war they wag'd before. Then Satan in a red-hot firy rage Comes belling, roaring ready to ingage To rend, and tare in pieces small all those, Whom in the former Quarrell he did lose. But's boyling Poyson'd madness, being by A shield Divine repelld, he thus lets fly. You Rebells all, I Will you gripe, and fist. I'le make my Jaws a Mill to grin'de such Grists. Look not for Mercy, Mercy well doth see You'l be more false to her than Unto mee. You're the first Van that fell; you're Traitors, Foes, And Unto such Grace will no trust repose. You Second Ranck are Cowards, if Christ Come With you to fight his field, you'l from him run. You third are feeble-hearted; if Christs Crown Must stand or fall by you, you'l fling it down. You last did last the longest: but being ta'ne Are Prisoners made, and Jayle Birds must remain. It had been better on the Turff to dy Then in such Deadly slavery to ly. Nay, at the best you all are Captive Foes. Will Wisdom have no better aid than those? Trust to a forced Faith? To hearts well known To be (like yours) to all black Treason Prone? For when I shall let fly at you, you'l fall: And so fall foule Upon your Generall. Hee'l Hang you up alive then; by and by. And I'le you wrack too for your treachery. He will become your foe, you then shall bee Flanckt of by him before, behinde by mee. You'st stand between us two our spears to dunce. Can you Offend and Fence both wayes at once? You'l then have sharper service than the Whale, Between the Sword fish, and the Threshers taile. You'l then be mawld worse than the hand thats right Between the heads of Wheelhorn'd Rams that fight. What will you do when you shall squezed bee Between such Monstrous Gyants Jaws as Wee? The Souls Address to Christ against these Assaults. Thou Gracious Lord, Our Honour'd Generall May't suite thy Pleasure never to impute, It our Presumption, when presume we shall To line thy Noble Ears with our Greate suite? With ropes about our necks we come and lie, Before thy pleasure's Will, and Clemency. When we unto the height of Sin were grown, We sought thy Throne to overthrow; but were In this our seeking Quickly overthrown: A Mass of Mercy in thy face shone cleare. We quarter had: though if we'de had our share We had been quarter'd up as Rebells are. Didst thou thy Grace on Treators arch expend? And force thy Favour on thy stubborn Foe? And hast no Favour for a failing Friend, That in thy Quarrell trippeth with his toe? If thus it be, thy Foes Speed better far, Than do thy Friends, that go to fight thy War. But is it as the Adversary said? Dost thou not hear his murdering Canons roare? What Vollies fly? What Ambushments are laid? And still his stratagems grow more, and more. Lord, fright this frightfull Enemy away. A Trip makes not a Traitor: Spare we pray. And if thou still suspect us come, and search: Pluck out our hearts and search them narrowly. If Sin allow'd in any Corner learch, We beg a Pardon, and a Remedy. Lord Gybbit up such Rebells Arch Who do Set ope the back doore to thy Cursed foe. Christs Reply. I am a Captain to your Will. You found me Gracious, so shall still, Whilst that my Will is your Design. If that you stick unto my Cause Opposing whom oppose my Laws I am your own, and you are mine. The weary Soule I will refresh And Ease him of his heaviness. Who'le slay a Friend? And save a Foe? Who in my War do take delight, Fight not for prey, but Pray, and Fight Although they slip, I'le mercy show. Then Credit not your Enemy Whose Chiefest daintie is a lie. I will you comfort sweet extend. Behold I am a sun and shield And a sharp sword to win the field. I'l surely Crown you in the End. His murdering Canons which do roare And Engins though as many more Shoot onely aire: no Bullets fly. Unless you dare him with your Crest, And ope to him the naked breast, Small Execution's done thereby. To him that smiteth hip, and thigh, My foes as his: Walks warily, I'le give him Grace: he'st give me praise. Let him whose foot doth hit a Stone Through weakeness, not rebellion Not faint, but think on former dayes. The Effect of this Reply with a fresh Assault from Satan. Like as the Shining Sun, we do behold, Is hot, and Light, when th'Weather waxeth Cold: Like as brave Valour in a Captain steels His Armies Courage, when their spirit reels. As Aqua Vitae when the Vitalls faile: So doth this speech the Drooping Soul availe. How doth this Answer Mercies Captives Cheer? Yet those whom Justice took still Drooping were, And in this nick of time the Foe through spite Doth like a glorious Angell seem of Light. Yet though he painteth o're his Velvet smut. He Cannot yet Conceal his Cloven foot. Hence in their joy he straweth poyson on, Those Objects that their senses feed upon. By some odde straggling thought up poyson flies Into the heart: and through the Eares, and Eyes. Which sick, lies gasping: Other thoughts then high To hold its head; and Venom'd are thereby. Hence they are influenc't to selfe Ends: these darts Strike secret swelling Pride up in their hearts. The which he fosters till the bladder flies In pieces; then joy lies agast and dies. Now Satan counts the Cast his own thus thrown: Off goes the Angels Coate, on goes his own. With Griping Paws, and Goggling Eyes draws nigher, Like some fierce Shagg'd Red Lion, belching fire: Doth stoutly Charge them home that they did fall And breake the Laws of their Choice Admirall. And his attend: and so were his. For they Must needs be his whom ever they obey. Thus he in frightfull wise assaults them all, Then one by one doth singly on them fall, Doth winnow them with all his wiles, he can, As Wheate is winnow'd with the Sieve, and Fan. First Satans Assault against those that first Came up to Mercys terms. SATAN Soon ripe, soon rot. Young Saint, Old Divell. Loe Why to an Empty Whistle did you goe? What Come Uncalld? And Run unsent for? Stay Its Childrens Bread: Hands off: out, Dogs, away. SOUL It's not an Empty Whistle: yet withall, And if it be a Whistle, then a Call: A Call to Childrens Bread, which take we may. Thou onely art the Dog whipt hence away. SATAN If I then you: for by Apostasy You are the Imps of Death as much as I. And Death doth reign o're you through Sin: you see, As well as Sin doth reign to Death in mee. SOUL It is deni'd: Gods Mercy taking place, Prepared Grace for us, and us for Grace. And Graces Coach in Grace hath fetcht us in, Unto her Feast. We shall not dy in Sin. SATAN If it be so, your sins are Crucifide: Which if they be, they struggl'd when they di'de. It is not so with you: you judge before You felt them gird, you'de got them out of Doore. SOUL Mercy the Quartermaster speedily, Did stifle Sin, and still its hidious Cry, Whose Knife at first stuck in its heart to th'head: That sin, before it hard did sprunt, fell dead. SATAN A mere Delusion! Nature shows that Life Will strugle most upon the bloody Knife And so will Sin. Nay Christ doth onely Call, And offer ease to such as are in thrall. SOUL He offer'd unto mee, and I receiv'd Of what hee wrought, I am not yet bereav'd. Though Justice set Amercement on mee Mercy hath took it off, and set me free. SATAN Is Mercy impudent? or Justice blinde? I am to make distraint on thee Designd. The North must wake before the South proves Kind. The Law must breake before the Gospell binde. SOUL But Giliads Balm, like Balsom heald my wound Makes not the Patient sore, yet leaves him sound. The Gospell did the Law prevent: my heart Is therefore dresst from Sin: and did not smart. SATAN A likely thing! Oh shame! presume on Grace! Here's Sin in Grain: it hath a Double Face. Come, Come with mee I'le shew your Outs, and Inns, Your Inside, and your out: your Holy things. For these I will anatomize then see, Believe your very Eyes, believe not mee. The Accusation of the Inward Man. You want Cleare Spectacles: your eyes are dim: Turn inside out: and turn your Eyes within. Your sins like motes in th'sun do swim: nay see Your Mites are Molehills, Molehills Mountains bee. Your Mountain Sins do magnitude transcend: Whose number's numberless, and do want end. The Understandings dark, and therefore Will Account of Ill for Good, and Good for ill. As to a Purblinde man men oft appeare Like Walking Trees within the Hemisphere. So in the judgment Carnall things Excell: Pleasures and Profits beare away the Bell. The Will is hereupon perverted so, It laquyes after ill, doth good foregoe. The Reasonable Soule doth much delight A Pickpack t'ride o'th'Sensuall Appitite. And hence the heart is hardened and toyes, With Love, Delight, and Joy, yea Vanities. Make but a thorow search, and you may spy Your soul a trudging hard, though secretly Upon the feet of your Affections mute. And hankering after all forbidden fruite. Ask but yourselfe in secret laying neer Thy head thereto: 'twill Whisper in thine eare That it is tickled much, though secretly. And greatly itches after Vilany. 'Twill fleere thee in thy face, and though it say, It must not tell, it scorns to tell thee nay. But Slack the rains, and Come a Loophole lower: You'l finde it was but Pen-coop't up before. Nay, muster up your thoughts, and take the Pole Of what walk in the Entry of your Soule Which if you do, you certainly will finde With Robbers, Cut-throats, Theives its mostly linde. And hundred Roagues you'l finde, ly gaming there. For one true man, that in that path appears. Your True man too's oft footsore, sildom is, Sound Winde, and Limb: and still to add to this, He's but a Traviller within that Way: Whereas the rest there pitch their Tents, and stay. Nay, nay, what thoughts Unclean? Lacivious? Blasphemous? Murderous? and Malicious? Tyranick? Wrathfull? Atheistick rise Of Evills New, and Old, of e'ry Sise? These bed, and board here, make the heart a sty Of all Abominable Brothlery. Then is it pure? is this the fruite of Grace? If so, how do yee: You and I Embrace. The Outward Man accused. Turn o're thy Outward man, and judge aright. Doth not a Pagans Life out Shine thy Light? Thy fleering Looks, thy Wanton Eyes, each part Are Painted Sign-Post of a Wanton heart. If thou art weigh'd in Golden Scales; Dost do To others as thou wouldst be done unto? Weigh weigh thy Words: thy Untruths, all which came Out of thy mouth, and thou Confest the same. Why did thy Tongue detract from any one, Whisper such tales thou wouldst not have be known? When thou was got in such a merry veane How far didst thou exceed the golden mean? When that thou wast at such a Boon, or Feast Why didst thou rather ly, than lose thy jeast? How wast thou tickled when thy droughty Eares Allay'de their Thirst with filthy squibs, and jears? Why didst thou glaver men of place? And why, Scowle, Glout, and Frown, on honest Poverty? Why did'st thou spend thy State in foolish prancks? And Peacock up thyselfe above thy rancks? Why thoughtst thyselfe out of the World as shut, When not with others in the Cony Cut? Hold up thy head, is't thus or no? if yea, How then is all thy folly purgd away? If no, thy tongue belies itselfe, for loe Thou saidst thy heart was dresst from sin also. The Soul accused in its Serving God. When thou dost go to serve thy God, behold What greate Distractions do thy Soule infold? How thy Religious Worship's much abusde? And with Confusion greate thy Soul's amus'de? What thoughts to God on Errand dost thou send That have not Sin therein, or in the End? In Holy-Waters I delight to fish For then I mudd them, or attain a Dish, Of Holy things. I oft have Chiefest part, And Cutting: nay do Carve the fat, and heart. For in Gods worship still thy heart doth cling Unto and follows toyish Earthly things. And what thou offer'st God his Holy Eye Sees, is an Offering of Hypocrisy. And if thou saw'st no hell, nor heaven; I see, My Soule for thine, thy Soule and mine agree. What then's thy Love to God, and Piety? Is it not selfish? And Comes in by th'by? For selfe is all thine aim; not God thine end: And what Delight hath he in such a friend? Lip Love is little else, but such a ly, As makes the matter but Hypocrisy. What's thy Repentance? Can'st thou come and show By those salt Rivers which do Ebb, and Flow By th'motion of that Ocean Vast within, Of pickled sorrow rising for thy Sin? For Sin prooves very Costly unto all. It Cost Saint Peter bitter tears, and Paul. Thy joy is groundless, Faith is false, thy Hope Presumption, and Desire is almost broke. Zeale Wildfire is, thy Pray'res are sapless most, Or like the Whistling of some Dead mans Ghost: Thy Holy Conference is onely like An Empty Voice that tooteth through a pipe. Thy Soule doth peep out at thine Eares, and Eyes To bless those bawbles that are earthly toyes. But when Gods Words in at those Windows peepe To kiss thy Soul, thy Soul lies dead asleep. Examine but thy Conscience, her reply, Will suite hereto: For Conscience dare not ly. When did thine Eyes run down for sin as sin, That thus thy heart runs up with joy to sing? Thy sins do sculk under a flowrisht paint. Hence thou a Sinner art, or I a Saint. SOUL Well, Satan, well: with thee I'le parle no more. But do adjure thee hence: begone therefore. If I as yet was thine, I thus do say I from thy flag would quickly flag away. Begone therefore; to him I'le send a groane Against thee drawn, who makes my heart his Throne. The Souls Groan to Christ for Succour. Good Lord, behold this Dreadfull Enemy Who makes me tremble with his fierce assaults, I dare not trust, yet feare to give the ly, For in my soul, my soul finds many faults. And though I justify myselfe to's face: I do Condemn myselfe before thy Grace. He strives to mount my sins, and them advance Above thy Merits, Pardons, or Good Will Thy Grace to lessen, and thy Wrath t'inhance As if thou couldst not pay the sinners bill. He Chiefly injures thy rich Grace, I finde Though I confess my heart to sin inclin'de. Those Graces which thy Grace enwrought in mee, He makes as nothing but a pack of Sins. He maketh Grace no grace, but Crueltie, Is Graces Honey Comb, a Comb of Stings? This makes me ready leave thy Grace and run. Which if I do, I finde I am undone. I know he is thy Cur, therefore I bee Perplexed lest I from thy Pasture stray. He bayghs, and barks so veh'mently at mee. Come rate this Cur, Lord, breake his teeth I pray. Remember me I humbly pray thee first. Then halter up this Cur that is so Curst. Christs Reply. Peace, Peace, my Hony, do not Cry, My Little Darling, wipe thine eye, Oh Cheer, Cheer up, come see. Is anything too deare, my Dove, Is anything too good, my Love To get or give for thee? If in the severall thou art This Yelper fierce will at thee bark: That thou art mine this shows. As Spot barks back the sheep again Before they to the Pound are ta'ne, So he and hence 'way goes. But yet this Cur that bayghs so sore Is broken tootht, and muzzled sure, Fear not, my Pritty Heart. His barking is to make thee Cling Close underneath thy Saviours Wing. Why did my sweeten start? And if he run an inch too far, I'le Check his Chain, and rate the Cur. My Chick, keep clost to mee. The Poles shall sooner kiss, and greet And Paralells shall sooner meet Than thou shalt harmed bee. He seeks to aggrivate thy sin And screw them to the highest pin, To make thy faith to quaile. Yet mountain Sins like mites should show And then these mites for naught should goe Could he but once prevaile. I smote thy sins upon the Head. They Dead'ned are, though not quite dead: And shall not rise again. I'l put away the Guilt thereof, And purge its Filthiness cleare off: My Blood doth out the stain. And though thy judgment was remiss Thy Headstrong Will too Wilfull is. I will Renew the same. And though thou do too frequently Offend as heretofore hereby I'l not severly blaim. And though thy senses do inveagle Thy Noble Soul to tend the Beagle, That t'hunt her games forth go. I'le Lure her back to me, and Change Those fond Affections that do range As yelping beagles doe. Although thy sins increase their race, And though when thou hast sought for Grace, Thou fallst more than before If thou by true Repentence Rise, And Faith makes me thy Sacrifice, I'l pardon all, though more. Though Satan strive to block thy way By all his Stratagems he may: Come, come though through the fire. For Hell that Gulph of fire for sins, Is not so hot as t'burn thy Shins. Then Credit not the Lyar. Those Cursed Vermin Sins that Crawle All ore thy Soul, both Greate, and small Are onely Satans own: Which he in his Malignity Unto thy Souls true Sanctity In at the doors hath thrown. And though they be Rebellion high, Ath'ism or Apostacy: Though blasphemy it bee: Unto what Quality, or Sise Excepting one, so e're it rise. Repent, I'le pardon thee. Although thy Soule was once a Stall Rich hung with Satans nicknacks all; If thou Repent thy Sin, A Tabernacle in't I'le place Fild with Gods Spirit, and his Grace. Oh Comfortable thing! I dare the World therefore to show A God like me, to anger slow: Whose wrath is full of Grace. Doth hate all Sins both Greate, and small: Yet when Repented, pardons all. Frowns with a Smiling Face. As for thy outward Postures each, Thy Gestures, Actions, and thy Speech, I Eye and Eying spare, If thou repent. My Grace is more Ten thousand times still tribled ore Than thou canst want, or ware. As for the Wicked Charge he makes, That he of Every Dish first takes Of all thy holy things. Its false, deny the same, and say, That which he had he stool away Out of thy Offerings. Though to thy Griefe, poor Heart, thou finde In Pray're too oft a wandring minde, In Sermons Spirits dull. Though faith in firy furnace flags, And Zeale in Chilly Seasons lags. Temptations powerfull. These faults are his, and none of thine So far as thou dost them decline. Come then receive my Grace. And when he buffits thee therefore If thou my aid, and Grace implore I'le shew a pleasant face. But still look for Temptations Deep, Whilst that thy Noble Sparke doth keep Within a Mudwald Cote. These White Frosts and the Showers that fall Are but to whiten thee withall. Not rot the Web they smote. If in the fire where Gold is tride Thy Soule is put, and purifide Wilt thou lament thy loss? If silver-like this fire refine Thy Soul and make it brighter shine: Wilt thou bewaile the Dross? Oh! fight my Field: no Colours fear: I'l be thy Front, I'l be thy reare. Fail not: my Battells fight. Defy the Tempter, and his Mock. Anchor thy heart on mee thy Rock. I do in thee Delight. An Extasy of Joy let in by this Reply returnd in Admiration. My Sweet Deare Lord, for thee I'le Live, Dy, Fight. Gracious indeed! My Front! my Rear! Almighty magnify a Mite: O! What a Wonder's here? Had I ten thousand times ten thousand hearts: And Every Heart ten thousand Tongues; To praise, I should but stut odd parts Of what to thee belongs. If all the world did in Alimbeck ly, Bleeding its Spirits out in Sweat; It could not halfe enlife a Fly To Hum thy Praises greate. If all can't halfe enlife a Fly to hum, (Which scarce an Animall we call) Thy Praises then which from me come, Come next to none at all. For I have made myselfe ten thousand times More naught than nought itselfe, by Sin. Yet thou extendst thy Gracious Shines For me to bath therein. Oh! Stand amaizd yee Angells Bright, come run Yee Glorious Heavens and Saints, to sing: Place yee your praises in the sun, Ore all the world to ring. Nay stand agast, ye sparkling Spirits bright! Shall little Clods of Dust you peere? Shall they toote Praises on your pipe? Oh! that we had it here. What can a Crumb of Dust sally such praise Which do from Earth all heaven o're ring Who swaddle up the suns bright rayes Can in a Flesh Flie's Wing? Can any Ant stand on the Earth and spit Another out to peer with this? Or Drink the Ocean up, and yet Its belly empty is? Thou may'st this World as easily up hide Under the Blackness of thy naile: As scape Sins Gulph without a Guide: Or Hell without a bale. If all the Earthy Mass were rambd in Sacks And saddled on an Emmet small, Its Load were light unto those packs Which Sins do bring on all. But sure this burden'd Emmet moves no wing. Nay, nay, Compar'd with thee, it flies. Yet man is easd his weight of Sin. From hell to Heav'n doth rise. When that the World was new, its Chiefe Delight, One Paradise alone Contain'de: The Bridle of Mans Appetite The Appletree refrain'de. The which he robbing, eat the fruit as good, Whose Coare hath Chokd him and his race. And juyce hath poyson'd all their blood, He's in a Dismall Case. None can this Coare remove, Poyson expell: He, if his Blood ben't Clarifi'de Within Christs veans, must fry in Hell, Till God be satisfi'de. Christ to his Father saith, Incarnate make Mee, Mee thy Son; and I will doe't: I'le purify his Blood, and take The Coare out of his Throate. All this he did, and did for us, vile Clay: Oh! let our Praise his Grace assaile. To free us from Sins Gulph each way, He's both our Bridge, and Raile. Although we fall and Fall, and Fall and Fall And Satan fall on us as fast. He purgeth us and doth us call Our trust on him to Cast. My Lumpish Soule why art thou hamper'd thus Within a Crumb of Dust? Arise, Trumpet out Praises. Christ for us Hath slain our Enemies. Screw up, Deare Lord, upon the highest pin: My soul thy ample Praise to sound. O tune it right, that every string May make thy praise rebound. But oh! how slack, slow, dull? with what delay, Do I this Musick to, repare, While tabernacled in Clay My Organs Cottag'de are? Yet Lord accept this Pittance of thy praise Which as a Traveller I bring, While travelling along thy wayes In broken notes I sing. And at my journies end in endless joyes I'l make amends where Angells meet And sing their flaming Melodies In Ravishing tunes most sweet. The Second Ranke Accused. You that are branded for Rebellion What whimsy Crotchets do you feed upon? Under my Flag you fighting did Defie And Vend much Venom spit at God most high: You dar'de him as a Coward, out, and Went Flinging your Poyson'd darts against his tent. When Grace did sound her parle, you stopt the Eare: You backward drew as she to you drew neere. But whats this Grace, which you, forsooth, so prize, For which you stand your own Sworn Enemies? Whoever saw smelt, tasted felt the same? Its but an airy notion, or a name. Fine food for fools, or shallow brains, who know No better fair and therefore let all go. Did mercy better Cain, or make him thrive When he pronounc'd himselfe a Fugitive? What Benefit had Esau who did weep And in Repenting teares did scald his Cheek? Or what King Ahab, that he softly went? Or what poore Judas that he did repent? Grace doom'd them down to hellish flames, although To Court the same they steep't their Souls in woe. To whom she yields a smile, she doth expect That with a smile, her smile they soon accept But you have hitherto like sturdy Clowns Affronted Grace and paid her Smiles with Frowns. Nay Mercy lookes before she Gives, to see That those to whom she gives true Christians bee. That all the Graces of the Spirit do Like Clouds of sweet perfume from such forth flow. And that their Souls be to the spirits feet An Aromatick Spicery most sweet. Is't so with you? You from her scepter fly, As judging it a grace graceless to dy. Your Faith's a Phancy: Fear a Slavery. Your Hope is Vain, Patience Stupidity. Your Love is Carnall, selfish, set on toyes: Your Pray'res are Prattle, or Tautologies. Your Hearts are full of sins both small, and Greate. They are as full as is an Egge of meate. Your Holy Conference and talkings do But for a Broken Piece of Non-Sense go. If so, you are accurst; God doth impart His Blessings onely on the broken heart. But search your peace turnd o're, and view each side Graces Magnetick touch will it abide? Doth Mercys Sun through Peaces lattice clear Shine in thy Soule? Then what's that Uproare there? Look well about you, try before you trust. Though Grace is Gracious; Justice still is just. If so it be with you, say what you can You are not Saints, or I no Sinner am. The Third Rank accused. What thou art too for Christ, it seems? Yet fain Thou wouldst the World with all her Pomps mentain. But such as share of Christ, fall short of these. And have but faint affections to such fees. Go Coach thy Eyes about the world, and eye Those Rich inchanting Braveries there Cry Give us your heart? Wherefore thy heart doth ake That it such Amorous Objects must forsake. The Love whereto so stuffs thy heart; no place Is left therein for any Saving Grace. Its folly then to think that Grace was shown, When in persute thy heart was overthrown. It was not Grace in Grace that made thee fall: For unto Grace thou hast no heart at all. Thou thoughtst these Objects of thy Love would faile. The thoughts of which do make thy Spirits faile. And this is easely prov'd: for thou didst goe Into the field with God, as with a foe. And bravely didst outbrave the Notion Grace. And Chose to flee rather than it imbrace. And well thou mightst, A Bird in hand doth far Transcend the Quires that in the Hedges are. And so its still: turn o're thy heart, thou'lt finde As formerly so still thou art inclinde. In sin thou hadst delight, didst grace defy: And dost so still: For still thou dost reply. Whoever went to Hell, and Came again To shew to anyone, what is that pain? Did ever any slip to Heaven to see Whether there's there a God? and who is hee? What is that fancide God rowld o're the tongue? Oh! Brainsick Notion, or an Oldwifes Song! That He should wholy be in e'ry place At once all here, and there, yet in no space. That all should be in any part though small: That any part of him should be him all. And that he hath no parts though Head, and Heart. Hands, Ears, and Eyes he hath, he hath no part. That he is all in all, yea all in thee, That he is also all that time in mee. That he should be all in each Atom small: And yet the whole cannot contain him all. That he doth all things in a moment see, At once, of things to Come, Past, and now bee. That He no Elder, he no Younger is, Than when the World began: (What wonders this?) That time that flies from all with him remains, These are Chamaera's Coin'd in Wanton brains. Among which Fopperies mans Soul may go, Concerning which thou mak'st so much ado. Nay; what? or where is Hell Can any show? This Bugbare in the Darke, 's a mere Scar-Crow. But say its true, there is an Hell: a God. A Soul Immortall in a mortall Clod: Did God such principles infuse as egge The Soul from him into Eternall plague? Thou dost Confess that God doth not Command Such things of us as had are of no hand. Which sure he doth, if he deny to save Whom live by Natures Law: which Law he Gave. Yet grant this tenet which thy heart denies, Christ saveth none but whom he sanctifies. Thou art not sanctifide in any part: For sins keepe Centinall within thy heart And there they train, therein they Rentdevouz. Her troops therein do quarter: and do house. And hence as from a fountain Head there streams Through ev'ry part Pollution in the Veans. Hence sprouts Presumption making much too bold To catch such Shaddows which no hand can hold. Hence Harebrain'd Rashness rushes in the Brain: Hence Madbrain'd Anger which no man can tame. Hence Crackbrain'd folly, or a shatter'd Wit That none Can Plaster: none can med'cine it. Hence a stiff, stubborn, and Rebellious Will That sooner breakes than buckles to fulfill Gods Laws: and so for other sins thou'lt find A Forward Will joyn'd with a froward minde. Thy Heart doth lip such Languague, though thy Lip Is loath to let such Languague open slip. I see thy secret thoughts: and such they bee, That Wish there was no God, or I was Hee. Or that there was no Holiness, unless Those sins thou'rt given to, were Holiness. Or that there was no Hell, except for those Who stand for Holiness, and sin oppose. Or that there was no heaven t'enter in, Except for those Who pass their Lives in Sin. Though thou the Languague of thy heart outface Dost, yet thou huggest sin, dost hiss out Grace. Set Heaven, and Hell aside its clearly shown, Thou lov'st mee more than God thou seem'st to own. Hence was it not for these, it plainly 'pears Thy God for servants might go shake his ears. For thou to keep within my booke dost still Ungod thy God not walking by his Will. This Languague of thy heart doth this impart I am a Saint, if thou no Sinner art. A Threnodiall Dialogue between The Second and Third Ranks. SECOND Oh you! How do you? Alas! how do things go With you, and with your Souls? For once we know You did as we, Welt, Wallow, Soake in Sin; For which Gods ire infires our hearts within. THIRD Ne're worse, though when secure in sin much worse. Though curst by sin, we did not feele the Curse. Now seing we no help can see, we, rue. Would God it was with us as't is with you. SECOND With us! alas! a Flint would melt to see A Deadly foe, in such a Case as wee. God seems our Foe, repent we Can't: but finde To ill Goodwill, to Good, a wayward minde. THIRD This is in you your Grace, we easely spie The Love of God within your looks to ly. But oh! our Souls set in sins Cramp stand bent To Badness, and no Grace we have t'Repent. SECOND This is your Charity. But if you saw Those ugly Crawling Sins that do us knaw You'd Change your minde. You mourn, and pray we see: We would not for a World, you were as wee. THIRD Repent! and Pray! Aye, so the Traytor Cast, Cries, Good my Lord! yea, when his Doom is past. You erre through your Abundant Charity. We dare not wish, as we, our Enemy. SECOND Your Low esteemings of yourselves enlarge Ours of you much. But oh, that Dismall Charge! We don't Repent, Believe, we nothing do: No Grace we have though something Gracelike show. THIRD Is't so with you who do so much out do Poor nothings us? Oh! whither shall we go? Our Grace a Mockgrace is: of Ulcerous Boiles. We are as full, as Satan is of Wiles. SECOND There's not a Sin that is not in our Heart. And if Occasion were, it would out start. There's not a Precept that we have not broke. Hence not a Promise unto us is spoke. THIRD Its worse with us: The Preacher speaks no word. The Word of God no sentence doth afford; But fall like burning Coals of Hell new blown Upon our Souls: and on our Heads are thrown. SECOND Its worse with us. Behold Gods threatonings all; Nay Law, and Gospell, on our Heads do fall. Both Hell, and Heaven, God and Divell Do With Wracking Terrours Consummate our Woe. THIRD We'le ne're believe that you are worse than wee, For Worse than us wee judge no Soul can bee. We know not where to run, nor what to doe. Would God it was no worse with us than you. SECOND Than us, alas! What, would you fain aspire Out of the Frying Pan into the Fire? Change States with you with all our hearts we would Nay, and give boot therewith, if that we could. THIRD Say what you can, we can't but thinke this true That Grace's Ambush hath surprized you. But Judgment layes an Ambush strong to take SECOND What Charity have you for us? When thus You judge amiss both of yourselves and us? What pitty is't? Yet God will you repay. Although we perish, and be cast away. THIRD The Lord forbid the last, and grant we may Deceived be wherein we be, you say. We Cannot wish a Toade as wee, but Crave, Your prayers for us, that we may pardon have. SECOND Our Pray'res, are pray'reless: Oh! to what we bee An ugly Toad's an Angell bright we see. Oh pray, pray you, oh pray, for us that so The Lord of Mercy Mercy on's may show. THIRD O would we could! but oh Hells Gripes do grinde Yea writh our Souls with Cramps of e'ry kinde. If Grace begrace us not, we go to Hell. The Good Lord help us both, thus fare you Well. Their Call in this Sad State for Mercy. We humbly beg, oh Lord, to know our Crime. That we thus tortur'de are before our time. Before our Time? Lord give's this Word again. For we have long ago deserv'de Hells flame. If Mercy wrought not Miracles none could Us monuments of mercy now behold. But oh! while Mercy waits we slaves to sin, Heap up sins Epha far above the brim. What shall we do when to account we're Calld? How will abused Mercy burn, and scald? We know not How, nor Where to stay or goe. We know not whom, nor What to trust or doe. Should we run hence from Mercy, Justice will Run hotly after us our blood to spill. But should we run to Mercy, Justice may Hold Mercies hands while Vengeance doth us slay. And if we trust to Grace, necessity Binds us by force at Grace's Grace to ly. But if we run from Grace, we headlong cast Ourselves upon the Spiles of Ruine Vast. And if we claim her ours, she'l surely smite Us, for presuming on an others right. Who'le with a Leaking, old Crack't Hulk assay, To brave the raging Waves of Adria? Or who can Cross the Main Pacifick o're? Without a Vessell Wade from Shore to Shore? What wade the mighty main from brim to brim, As if it would not reach above the Chin? But, oh! poor wee, must wade from brinck to brinck With such a Weight as would bright Angells sink. Or venture angry Adria, or drown When Vengeance's sea doth break her floodgates down. If stay, or Go to sea we drown. Then see In what a wofull Pickle, Lord, we bee. Rather than tarry, or the rough sea trust, On the Pacificke Ocean forth we thrust. Necessity lies on's: we dare not stay: If drown we must, we'l drown in Mercy's Sea. Impute it not presumption if we high To Cast ourselves on Mercies Clemency. Is't not as great Presumption, Lord, to stand And gaze on ruine, but refuse the hand Which offers help? Or on such Courses fall Which fall to ruin, ruinating all? Lord, pitty, pitty us, Lord pitty send: A thousand pitties tis we should offend. But oh! we did, and are thereto propence: And what we count off, oft thou Countst offence. We've none to trust: but on thy Grace we ly, If dy we must, in mercy's arms wee'l dy. Then pardon, Lord, and put away our guilt. So we be thine, deale with us as thou wilt. The Soule Bemoning Sorrow rowling upon a resolution to seek Advice of Gods people. Alas! my Soule, product of Breath Divine, For to illuminate a Lump of Slime. Sad Providence! Must thou below thus tent, In such a Cote as strangles with ill sent? Or in such sensuall Organs make thy stay Which from thy noble end do make thee stray? My nobler part, why dost thou laquy to The Carnall Whynings of my senses so? What? thou become a Page, a Peasant, nay, A Slave unto a Durty Clod of Clay! Why should the Kirnell bring such Cankers forth To please the shell, as will devour them both? Why didst thou thus thy Milkwhite Robes defile With Crimson spots of scarlet sins most vile? My Muddy Tent, Why hast thou done so ill To Court, and kiss my Soule, yet kissing kill? Why didst thou Whyning, egg her thus away Thy sensuall Appetite to satisfy? Art thou so safe, and firm a Cabinet As though thou soaking lie in nasty wet, And in all filthy Puddles: yet though thin Can ne're drench through to stain the Pearle within? Its no such thing: Thou'rt but a Cawle-wrought Case. And when thou fallst, thou foulst its shining face. Or but her mudwalld Lid which, wet by sin Diffuseth all in her that it shuts in. One stain stains both, when both in one Combine. A Musty Cask doth marre rich Malmsy Wine. Woe's mee! my mouldring Heart! What must I do? When is my moulting time to shed my woe? Oh! Woefull fall! what fall from Heavenly bliss To th'bottom of the bottomless Abyss? Above an angry God! Below, black-blew Brimstony flames of hell where Sinners rue! Behinde, a Traile of Sins! Before appeare An Host of Mercies that abused were! Without a Raging Divell! and Within A Wracking Conscience Galling home for Sin! What Canst not finde one Remedy, my Soule, On Mercies File for mee? Oh! Search the Rowle. What freeze to death under such melting means, Of Grace's Golden, Life Enliv'ning Beams? What? not one Hope? Alas! I hope there's some. Although I know not in what way it come. Although there is no hope within my minde I'le force Hope's Faculty, till Hope I finde. Some glimmerings of Hope, I hope to spy In Mercies Golden Stacks, or Remedy. I therefore am Resolv'd a search to make, And of the Pious Wise some Counsill take. Ile then in Pensiveness myselfe apply To them in hope, but yet halfe hopelessly. Perhaps these thoughts are blessed motions, though From whence they are, as yet I do not know. And if from Christ, Oh! then thrice Happy mee. If not, I'st not be worser than I bee. The Preface. SOUL Long lookt for Sir! Happy, right Happy Saint. I long to lay before you my Complaint: And gain your Counsill: but you're strange: and I Through backwardness lost opportunity. SAINT How is't good Sir: methinks I finde there dart Some pleasant Hopes of you within my heart. What is your Rantery declinde, foregone? Your looks are like the Earth you Tread upon. SOUL Its true: I do, and well may look so, too For worse than mee the world did never show. My sins are dide in grain: all Grace I lack. This doth my Soul on tenterhooks enwrack. Wherefore I Counsill Crave touching my sin My Want of Grace. Temptations too within. The Souls Doubts touching its Sins Answerd. SAINT Is this thy Case, Poor Soul, Come then begin: Make known thy griefe: anatomize thy sin. Although thy sins as Mountains vast do show, Yet Grace's fountain doth these mountains flow. SOUL True, true indeed, where Mountains sinke but where They swim, their Heads above these mountains peare. Mine swim in Mercies boundless Ocean do: Therefore their Heads above these waters goe. SAINT I thought as you, but loe the Lyon hee Is not so fierce as he is feign'd to bee. But grant they swim, they'l then swim quite away On Mercies main, if you Repenting stay. SOUL I swim in Mercy: but my sins are sayles That waft my barke to Hell by Graces Gales. Is't possible for such as Grace outbrave (Which is my Case) true Saving Grace to have? SAINT That's not thy Sin: thou didst not thus transgress, Thy Grace-outbraveing sin is bashfulness. Thou art too backward. Satan strives to hold Thee fast hereby, and saith, thou art too bold. SOUL Alas! How are you out in mee, behold My best is poison in a Box of Gold. If with mine Eyes you saw my hearts black stain, You'de judge my Sins were double dide in grain. SAINT Deluded Soul, Satan beguiles thee so Thou judgst the bend the back side of the bow Dost press thyselfe too hard: Straite Wands appeare Crook't in, and out, in running rivlets Clear. SOUL You raise the fabrick of your pious hope Upon such water Bells, as rots denote. For my Profession doth but cloake my sin. A guilded Maukin's stufft with Chaff within. SAINT I love not thus to row in such a Stream: And if I did, I should so touch my Theme. But muster up your Sins, though more or few: Grace hath an Edge to Cut their bonds atwo. SOUL This is my Sin, My Sin I love, but hate God and his Grace. And who's in such a state? My Love, and Hatred do according rise Unto Sins height, and unto Grace's sise. SAINT I thought as you when first to make me see God powred out his Spirit sweet on mee. But oh strange Fetch! What Love, yet hate to have? And hate in heart what heartily you Crave? SOUL Sometimes meethinks I wish. Oh! that there were No Heaven nor Hell. For then I need not feare. I'm pestred with black thoughts of Blasphemy, And after thoughts do with these thoughts Comply. SAINT See Satans Wiles: while thou in sin didst dwell Thou Calledst not in Question Heaven, or Hell. But now thou'rt out with sin he makes thee Call In Question both, that thou in Hell mightst fall. SOUL But, oh! methinks, I finde I sometimes wish There was no God, or that there was not this. Or that his wayes were other than they bee. Oh! Horrid, horrid, Hellish thoughts in mee! SAINT 'Twas thus, or worse with me. I often thought, Oh! that there was no God: or God was Naught. Or that his Wayes were other Wayes. Yet hee In mighty mercy hath bemerci'de mee. SOUL My Heart is full of thoughts, and ev'ry thought Full of Sad, Hellish, Drugstery enwrought. Methinks it strange to Faith that God should bee Thus All in All, yet all in Each part. See. SAINT 'Twas so with me. Then let your Faith abound For Faith will stand where Reason hath no ground. This proves that God is Onely God: for hee Surpasseth the superlative degree. SOUL Methinks I am a Frigot fully fraught, And stoughed full with each Ath'istick thought. Methinks I hate to think on God: anone Methinks there is no God to thinke upon. SAINT I thought as much at first: my thoughts, so vain, Were thus that God was but stampt i'th'brain. But God disperst these Wicked thoughts. Behold The Various methods of the serpent old! SOUL All arguments against mee argue still: I see not one bespeaks me ought, but ill. Whatse're I use I do abuse: Oh! shew, Whether the Case was ever thus with you. SAINT It was: But see how Satan acts, for his He troubles not with such a thought as this. But Wicked thoughts he in the Saints doth fling, And saith they're theirs, accusing them of Sin. SOUL Methinks my heart is harder than a flint, My Will is Wilfull, frowardness is in't, And mine Affections do my Soule betray, Sedaning of it from the blessed way. SAINT Loe, Satan hath thy thoughts inchanted quite, And Carries them a pickpack from the right. Thou art too Credulous: For Satan lies. It is not as you deem: deem otherwise. SOUL But I allow of sin: I like it Well, And Chiefly grieve, because it goes to hell. And Were it ever so with you, I see Grace hath prevented you which doth not mee. SAINT I thought as you: but now I clearly spy, These Satans brats will like their Curst Sire ly. He squibd these thoughts in you, you know not how. And tempts you then to deem you them allow. SOUL And so I do: would I could Sins disown: But if I do, thy'l own me for their own. I have no Grace to do't: this prooves me in A Lamentable State, a State of Sin. SAINT What ambling work within a Ring is here? What Circular Disputes of Satans Geer? To proove thee Graceless he thy sins persues: To proove thee sinfull, doth thy Grace accuse. Why dost thou then believe the Tempter so? He seeks by helping thee thy Overthrow. Doubts from the Want of Grace Answerd. SOUL Such as are Gracious grow in Grace therefore Such as have Grace, are Gracious evermore. Who sin Commit are sinfull: and thereby They grow Ungodly. So I feare do I. SAINT Such as are Gracious, Graces have therefore They evermore desire to have more. But such as never knew this dainty fare Do never wish them 'cause they dainties are. SOUL Alas! alas! this still doth me benight. I've no desire, or no Desire aright. And this is Clear: my Hopes do witherd ly, Before their buds breake out, their blossoms dy. SAINT When fruits do thrive, the blossom falls off quite. No need of blossoms when the seed is ripe. The Apple plainly prooves the blossoms were. Thy withred Hopes hold out Desires as Cleare. SOUL Alas! my Hopes seem but like blasted fruit. Dead on the Stoole before it leaves its root. For if it lively were a growth it hath, And would be grown e're this to Saving Faith. SAINT I'le make most plain Which lively is, layes hold on Christ too, though Thou deemst it doth like blasted blossoms show. SOUL If it was so, then Certainly I should, With Faith Repentance have. But, oh! behold, This Grace leaves not in mee a single print. Mine Eyes are Adamant, my Heart is Flint. SAINT Repentance is not argued so from Tears. As from the Change that in the Soul appears. And Faith Ruld by the Word. Hence ever spare To mete Repentance out by Satans square. SOUL I fear Repentance is not Genuine. Its Feare that makes me from my sins decline. And if it was, I should delight much more, To bathe in all Gods Ordinances pure. SAINT And dost thou not? Poore Soule, thou dost I know. Why else dost thou Relent, and sorrow so? But Satan doth molest thee much to fling Thee from thy Dutie into e'ry Sin. SOUL If these were my Delight, I should Embrace The royall Retinue of Saving Grace, Peace, Patience Pray're, Meekness, Humility, Love, Temp'rance, Feare, Syncerety, and Joy. SAINT You do: though not alike at all times sure, And you do much desire to have more. I wonder that you judge them worth the having, Or Crave them, if they are not got by Craving. SOUL My measure is so small, I doubt, alas! Its next to none, and will for nothing pass. But if I had but this or that Degree, Of all these Graces, then thrice Happy mee! SAINT You have not what you Would, and therefore will Not own you have at all. What Sullen still? If God should fill you, and not work your bane, You would not be Content, but would Complain. SOUL What must my vessell voide of Grace be thrust By you in Glory thus among the Just As Gracious though the Dose of Grace I finde Is scarce a Grain? Can this Content your minde? SAINT God, and His All, 's the Object of the Will: All God alone can onely it up fill. He'd kill the Willer, if his Will he should Fill to the brim, while Cabbined in mould. What Mortall can contain immortall bliss; If it be poured on him as it is? A single Beam thus touching him Would make The stoutest mortall man to ashes shake. Will nothing give Content unless you have While here a mortall, all your Will can Crave? If so, the Promise which is made to those That hunger after Righteousness you'l lose. For being full, you could not hunger still Nor Wish for more you having once your Will. You cant contain Halfe, what in truth you would Or do not Wish for Halfe of what you should. Can't all the sea o'refill an Acorn bole? Can't God orefill a little Whimpring Soul? What Can a Nutshell all the World Enfold? Or can thy Heart all Heavens Glory Hold? And never break? What! Canst thou here below Weld Heavens bliss while mortall thus? Oh! No. God Loves you better than to grant your Cry, When you do Cry for that which will destroy. Give but a Child a Knife to still his Din: He'l cut his Fingers with it ere he blin. SOUL Had I but any Sparke of Grace, I might Have much more than I have with much delight. How can I trust to you? You do not know Whether I have a Grain of Grace, or no. SAINT You think you might have more: you shall have so, But if you'd all at once, you could not grow. And if you could not grow, you'd grieving fall. All would not then Content you, had you all. Should Graces Floodgate thus at once breake down You most would lose, or else it would you drown. He'l fill you but by drops that so he may Not drown you in't, nor Cast a Drop away. Doubts from Satans Temptations Answered. SOUL But oh the Tempter harries me so fast And on me falls to make me fall at last. Had I but Grace surely I might repell His firy Darts that dart on fire from hell. SAINT If you had none, he never would bestow Such darts upon you Grace to overthrow. The Bullets shot are blinde, the fowlers eye Aims at the marke before he lets them fly. SOUL But he bewilders me: I scarce can finde But lose myselfe again within my minde. My thoughts are Laberryntht, I can't enjoyn Any thereof the rest to discipline. SAINT I once was thus. The Crooked Serpent old Doth strive to hinder what he can't withhold. And where he cannot keep from Grace, he's loath, To keep from keeping Saving Grace from Growth. SOUL But if a Pious thought appeare, I finde It's brambled in the briers of my minde. Or in those brambles lost, or slinks away: But Viprous thoughts do in these thickets stay. With these I pest'red am in Duty so, I doubt I undo all thereby I do. SAINT First Satan envies each Choice thought: then hee To murder it, or make't short winded bee Doth raise a Fog, or fude of thoughts most vile Within the soul; and darkens all that ile. And when he cannot hinder pray're he'le strive To spoil the same, but still hold on, and thrive. SOUL But yet I feare there oft lurks secretly Under each Duty done Hypocrisy. I finde no heart unto the Wayes of Grace. It's but their End my heart would fain imbrace. SAINT Why give you Credit to your deadly foe? He turns ore ery stone Grace t'overthrow. He'l fight on both sides Grace, Grace to destroy. To ruinate your Souls Eternally. He makes some thus red mad on mischiefe grow And not to matter what they say, or do. He makes Civility to pass for Grace, With such as hunt riches hot senting trace. To such as God doth Call, he doth reply That all their Grace is but Hypocrisy. Contrarily, a Refuge strong to make For e'ry sin, he doth this method take. He tells the Doubting soul, this is no Sin, Until he Diveth over head therein. But then to breake his Heart he doth reply: That done is Sin, He sinned willingly. He to the Sinner saith, Great Sins are small, Small Sins he telleth him, are none at all. And so to such there is no sin: for why Great sins are small, Small None. But oh but eye If God awakes a Soul, he doth begin To make him count indifferent things as Sin, Nay Lawfull things wanting a Circumstance Or having one too much although by Chance. And thus he doth involve the doubting soule In dismall doubts and makes it fear to rowle, Himselfe on Christ for fear it should presume. But if he doth he quickly turns his tune And doth accuse, because he did not take As soon as mercy did an offer make. Oh! see the Craft the Serpent old doth use To hopple souls in Sin, and Sin to Choose. One while he terms true Grace a morall thing. One while morality a splendid Sin. SOUL You shew the matter as the matter is But shew me how in such a Case as this, T'repell the Tempter, and the field t'obtain, To Chaff away the Chaff and Choose the grain. SAINT Perform the Duty, leave th'event unto His Grace that doth both in, and outside know. Beg pardon for your Sins: bad thoughts defy, That are Cast in you by the Enemy. Approove yourselfe to God, and unto his And beg a pardon where you do amiss. If wronged go to God for right, and pray Hard thoughted Saints black thoughted thoughts away. Renew your acts of Faith: believe in him, Who died on the Cross to Cross out Sin. Allow not any Sin: and if you sin Through frailty, Faith will a new pardon bring. Do all Good Works, work all good things you know As if you should be sav'd for doing so. Then undo all you've done, and it deny And on a naked Christ alone rely. Believe not Satan, Unbelieve his tales Lest you should misbelieve the Gospell bales. Do what is right, and for the right Contend. Make Grace your way, and Glory'l be your End. Yet as a further Caution still I'le shew You other Wiles of Satan to eschue. And that a Saint may of a Saint account Not as a Saint though once with God in th'mount. Some of Satans Sophestry. The Tempter greatly seeks, though secretly, With an Ath'istick Hoodwinke man to blinde, That so the Footsteps of the Deity Might stand no longer stampt upon his minde. Which when he can't blot out, by blinding quite, He strives to turn him from the Purer Light. With Wiles enough, he on his thoughts intrudes, That God's a Heape of Contradictions high, But when these thoughts man from his thoughts excludes Thou knowst not then (saith he) this Mystery. And when the first String breaks, he strives to bring Into sins brambles by the other string. When God Calls out a Soule, he subtilly Saith God is kinde: you need not yet forsake Your Sins: but if he doth, he doth reply, Thou'st outstood Grace. Justice will vengeance take. He'l tell you you Presume on Grace, to fright You to despare, beholding Justice bright. Though just before mans mountain sins were mites, His mites were nothing. Now the scales are turn'd. His mites are mountains now, of mighty height And must with Vengeance-Lightening be burn'd. Greate Sins are Small, till men repent of Sin: Then Small are far too big to be forgi'n. While man thinks slightly, that he will repent, There's time enough (saith he), it's easly done. But when repent he doth, the time is spent, Saith he, it is too late to be begun. To keep man from't, it's easly done, saith he, To dant him in't, he saith, it Cannot bee. So Faith is easy till the Soule resolves To Live to Christ, and upon Christ rely. Then Saving Faith he bold presumption Calls. Hast thou (saith he) in Christ propriety? The Faithfulls Faith, he stiles Presumption great, But the Presumptuous, theirs is Faith Compleat. Nay though the Faith be true he acts so sly, As to raise doubts: and then it must not do: Unless Assurance do it Certify: Which if it do, it douts of it also. Faith is without Assurance shuffled out, And if Assurance be, that's still a Doubt. But should the Soule assured once, once Doubt, Then his Assurance no Assurance is: Assurance doth assure the Soul right out Leave not a single Doubt to do amiss. But Satan still will seeke to Pick an hole In thy Assurance to unsure thy Soul. Should any Soule once an Assurance get, Into his hands, soon Satans Pick-Lock key With Sinfull Wards Unlocks his Cabinet To Steal the Jewell in it thence away. The Soul thus pillag'de, droops unto the grave. It's greater grief to lose than not to have. He doth molest the Soule, it cannot see Without Assurance Extraordinary Which should it have, it would soon take to bee A Mere Delusion of the Adversary. Assurance would not serve, should God Convay It in an Usuall or Unusuall way. Thus I might search, Poor Soul, the Magazeen Of Gospell Graces over: I might paint Out Satan sculking each side each unseen To Hoodwinck Sinners, and to hopple Saints. For he to dim their Grace, and slick up sin Calls Brass bright Gold, bright Golde but brass or tin. He tempts to bring the soul too low or high, To have it e're in this or that extream: To see no want or want alone to eye: To keep on either side the golden mean. If it was in't to get it out he'l 'ledge, Thou on the wrong side art the Pale or Hedge. When God awakes a Soule he'l seeke to thrust It on Despare for want of Grace or get And puff't with Pride, or in Securety hush't Or Couzen it with Graces Counterfet. Which if he can't he'l Carp at Grace, and raile And say, this is not Grace, it thus doth faile. And thus he strives with Spite, Spleen, bitter Gall That Sinners might Dishonour God Most high: That Saints might never honour God at all. That those in Sin, Those not in Grace might dy. And that the Righteous, Gracious, Pious, Grave, Might have no Comfort of the Grace they have. Lest you be foild herewith, watch well unto Your Soul, that thrice Ennobled noble Gem: For Sins are flaws therein, and double woe Belongs thereto if it be found in them. Are Flaws in Venice Glasses bad? What in Bright Diamonds? What then in man is Sin? Difficulties arising from Uncharitable Cariages of Christians. When these assaults proove vain, the Enemy One Saint upon another oft doth set, To make each fret like to Gum'd Taffity, And fire out Grace thus by a Chafe or Fret. Uncharitable Christians inj'rous are: Two Freestons rubd together each do ware. When Satan jogs the Elbow of the one To Spleenish Passions which too oft doth rise, For want of Charity, or hereupon From some Uncharitable harsh Surmise, Then the Poore Doubting Soul is oft oppresst, By hard Reflections from an harder breast. Th' Uncharitable Soul oft thus reflects, After each Birth a second birth doth Come. Your Second Birth no Second Birth ejects. The Babe of Grace then's strangld in the Womb. There's no new Birth born in thy Soul thou'lt find If that the after Birth abide behinde. The Babe of Grace, thinks he, 's not born its sure. Sins Secundine is not as yet out Cast. The Soul no Bracelet of Graces pure Doth ware, while wrapt in nature's slough so fast. And thus he doth for want of Charity, The wounded wound Uncharitably. And thus some Child of God, when led awry By Satan, doth with Satan take a part, Against some Child of God, whom frowardly He by Reflections harsh wounds thus in heart. Pough! Here's Religion! Strange indeed! Quoth hee. Grace makes a Conscience of things here that bee. Grace Conscious makes one how to spend ones time How to perform the Duties of one's place Not onely in the things which are Divine; But in the things which ware a Sublime Face. Do you do so? And order good persue? Don't Earth and Heaven interfer in you? Will God accept the service if the time Is stolen from our Calling him to pay? What will he yield that Sacrifice his shine, That from anothers Altar's stole away? God and our Callings Call: and th' Sacrifice Stole from our Callings Altar he defies. Yet if it falls on worldly things intense Its soon scourgd then with whips of Worldliness: It gives to many, nay to all, offence And gathers to itselfe great penciveness. Intense on God, or on the world, all's one. The Harmless Soule is hardly thought upon. Such Traps, and Wilds as these are, Satan sets, For to intrap the Innocent therein: These are his Wyers, Snares, and tangling Nets, To hanck, and hopple harmless souls in Sin. If in such briars thou enbrambled light Call on the Mighty God with all thy might. On God in Christ Call hard: For in him hee Hath Bowells melting, and Expanded arms: Hath sweet imbraces, Tender mercy free Hath Might Almighty too to save from harms. Into his Dove streakt Downy bosom fly, In Spite of Spite, or Spiters Enmity. These are Gods Way-Marks thus inscrib'd; this hand Points you the way unto the Land Divine, The Land of Promise, Good Immanuels Land. To New Jerusalem above the line. Ten thousand times thrice tribled blesst he is, That walketh in the suburbs here of bliss. His Wildred state will wane away, and hence These Crooked Passages will soon appeare The Curious needlework of Providence, Embrodered with golden Spangles Cleare. Judge not this Web while in the Loom, but stay From judging it untill the judgment day. For while its foiled up the best Can see But little of it, and that little too Shews weather beaten but when it shall bee Hung open all at once, Oh beautious shew! Though thrids run in, and out, Cross snarld and twinde The Web will even be enwrought you'l finde. If in the golden Meshes of this Net (The Checkerwork of Providence) you're Caught And Carride hence to Heaven, never fret: Your Barke shall to an Happy Bay be brought. You'l se both Good and Bad drawn up hereby, These to Hells Horrour, those to Heavens Joy. Fear not Presumption then, when God invites: Invite not Fear, when that he doth thee Call: Call not in Question whether he delights In thee, but make him thy Delight, and all. Presumption lies in Backward Bashfulness, When one is backward though a bidden Guest. The Effect of this Discourse upon the second, and third Rancks. RANK TWO Whence Come these Spicy Gales? Shall we abuse Such sweet Perfumes with putrid noses? Who did in this Diffusive Aire Diffuse Such Aromatick fumes or Posies? These Spirits are with Graces sweetly splic'te; What Good Comes in them? Oh! they Come from Christ! RANK THREE Whence Come these Cloudy Pillars of Perfume? Sure Christ doth on his Garden blow Or open Graces Spice Box, I presume From whence these Reechs do flow: For oh! heart Ravishing steams do scale my Soule, And do in Heavenly Raptures it enrowle. RANK TWO Sure Grace a progress in her Coach doth ride, Lapt up in all Perfumes, whose sent, Hath suffocated sin, and nullifi'de Sad Griefe, as in our Souls it went. Sin sincks the Soul to Hell: but here is Love Sincks Sin to Hell; and soars the Soul above. RANK THREE I strove to soar on high. But oh! methought Like to a Lump of Lead my sin Prest down my Soul; But now it's off, she's Caught In holy Raptures up to him. Oh! let us then sing Praise: methinks I soar Above the stars, and stand at Heavens Doore. Our Insufficiency to Praise God suitably, for his Mercy. Should all the World so wide to atoms fall Should th'Aire be shred to motes, should we Se all the Earth hackt here so small That none Could smaller bee? Should Heaven, and Earth be Atomizd, we guess The Number of these Motes were numberless. But should we then a World each Atom deem, Where dwell as many pious men As all these Motes the world Could teem Were it shred into them? Each Atom would the World surmount wee guess Whose men in number would be numberless. But had each pious man, as many Tongues At singing all together then The Praise that to the Lord belongs As all these Atoms men? Each man would sing a World of Praise, we guess, Whose Tongues in number would be numberless. And had each Tongue, as many Songs of Praise To sing to the Almighty ALL As all these men have Tongues to raise To him their Holy Call? Each Tongue would tune a World of Praise, we guess Whose songs in number would be numberless. Nay, had each song as many Tunes most sweet Or one intwisting in't as many, As all these Tongues have songs most meet Unparallelld by any? Each song a world of Musick makes we guess Whose Tunes in number would be numberless. Now should all these Conspire in us that we Could breath such Praise to thee, Most High? Should we thy Sounding Organs be To ring such Melody? Our Musick would the World of Worlds out ring Yet be unfit within thine Eares to ting. Thou didst us mould, and us new mould when wee Were worse than mould we tread upon. Nay Nettles made by Sin wee bee. Yet hadst Compassion. Thou hast pluckt out our Stings; and by degrees Hast of us, lately Wasps, made Lady-Bees. Though e're our Tongues thy Praises due can fan A Weevle with the World may fly, Yea fly away: and with a span We may out mete the Sky. Though what we can is but a Lisp, We pray Accept thereof. We have no better pay. The Soule Seeking Church-Fellowship. The Soul refresht with gracious Steams, behold, Christs royall Spirit richly tended With all the guard of Graces manifold Throngs in to solace it amended And by the Trinity befriended. Befriended thus! It lives a Life indeed A Life! as if it Liv'd for Life. For Life Eternall: wherefore with all heed It trims the same with Graces rife To be the Lambs espoused Wife. Yea, like a Bride all Gloriously arraide It is arrai'de Whose dayly ware Is an Imbrodery with Grace inlaide, Of Sanctuary White most Faire, Its drest in Heavens fashion rare. Each Ordinance and Instrument of Grace Grace doth instruct are Usefull here. They're Golden Pipes where Holy Waters trace Into the spirits spicebed Deare, To vivify what withering were. Hence do their Hearts like Civit-Boxes sweet Evaporate their Love full pure, Which through the Chincks of their Affections reechs To God, Christ, Christians all, though more, To such whose Counsills made their Cure. Hence now Christ's Curious Garden fenced in With Solid Walls of Discipline Well wed, and watered, and made full trim: The Allies all Laid out by line: Walks for the Spirit all Divine. Whereby Corruptions are kept out, whereby Corrupters also get not in, Unless the Lyons Carkass secretly Lies lapt up in a Lamblike skin Which Holy seems yet's full of sin. For on the Towers of these Walls there stand Just Watchmen Watching day, and night, And Porters at each Gate, who have Command To open onely to the right. And all within may have a sight. Whose Zeale, should it along a Channell slide Not banckt with Knowledg right and Good, Nor Bottomed with Love: nor wiers ti'de To hinder prejudiciall Blood The Currant will be full of mud. But yet this Curious Garden richly set, The Soul accounts Christs Paradise Set with Choice slips, and flowers: and longs to get Itselfe set here: and by advice To grow herein and so rejoyce. The Soul admiring the Grace of the Church Enters into Church Fellowship. How is this City, Lord, of thine bespangled With Graces shine? With Ordinances alli'de, and inam'led, Which are Divine? Walld in with Discipline her Gates obtaine Just Centinalls with Love Imbellisht plain. Hence glorious, and terrible she stands; That Converts new Seing her Centinalls of all demand The Word to shew; Stand gazing much between two Passions Crusht Desire, and Feare at once which both wayes thrust. Thus are they wrackt. Desire doth forward screw To get them in, But Feare doth backward thrust, that lies purdue, And slicks that Pin. You cannot give the word, Quoth she, which though You stumble on't its more than yet you know. But yet Desires Screw Pin doth not slack: It still holds fast. But Fears Screw Pin turns back or Screw doth Crack And breaks at last. Hence on they go, and in they enter: where Desire Converts to joy: joy Conquours Fear. They now enCovenant With God: and His: They thus indent. The Charters Seals belonging unto this The Sacrament So God is theirs avoucht, they his in Christ. In whom all things they have, with Grace are splic'te. Thus in the usuall Coach of Gods Decree They bowle and swim To Glory bright, if no Hypocrisie Handed them in. For such must shake their handmaid off lest they Be shakt out of this Coach, or dy in th'way. The Glory of and Grace in the Church set out. Come now behold Within this Knot What Flowers do grow: Spanglde like gold: Whence Wreaths of all Perfumes do flow. Most Curious Colours of all sorts you shall With all Sweet Spirits sent. Yet thats not all. Oh! Look, and finde These Choicest Flowers most richly sweet Are Disciplinde With Artificiall Angells meet. An heap of Pearls is precious: but they shall When set by Art Excell: Yet that's not all. Christ's Spirit showers Down in his Word, and Sacraments Upon these Flowers The Clouds of Grace Divine Contents. Such things of Wealthy Blessings on them fall As make them sweetly thrive: Yet that's not all. Yet still behold! All flourish not at once. We see While some Unfold Their blushing Leaves, some buds there bee. Here's Faith, Hope, Charity in flower, which call On yonders in the Bud. Yet that's not all. But as they stand Like Beauties reeching in perfume A Divine Hand Doth hand them up to Glories room: Where Each in sweet'ned Songs all Praises shall Sing all ore heaven for aye. And that's but all. The Souls Admiration hereupon. What I such Praises sing! How can it bee? Shall I in Heaven sing? What I, that scarce durst hope to see Lord, such a thing? Though nothing is too hard for thee: One Hope hereof seems hard to mee. What, Can I ever tune those Melodies Who have no tune at all? Not knowing where to stop nor Rise, Nor when to Fall. To sing thy Praise I am unfit. I have not learn'd my Gam-Ut yet. But should these Praises on string'd Instruments Be sweetly tun'de? I finde I nonplust am: for no Consents I ever minde. My Tongue is neither Quill, nor Bow: Nor Can my Fingers Quavers show. But was it otherwise I have no Kit: Which though I had, I could Not tune the strings, which soon would slip Though others should. But should they not, I cannot play: But for an F should strike an A. And should thy Praise upon Winde Instruments Sound all o're Heaven Shrill? My Breath will hardly through such Vents A Whistle fill, Which though it should, its past my spell By Stops, and Falls to sound it Well. How should I then, joyn in such Exercise? One sight of thee'l intice Mine Eyes to heft: Whose Extasies Will stob my Voice. Hereby mine Eyes will bind my Tongue. Unless thou, Lord, do Cut the thong. What Use of Useless mee, then there, poore snake? There Saints, and Angels sing, Thy Praise in full Cariere, which make The Heavens to ring. Yet if thou wilt thou Can'st me raise With Angels bright to sing thy Praise. The Joy of Church Fellowship rightly attended. In Heaven soaring up, I dropt an Eare On Earth: and oh! sweet Melody: And listening, found it was the Saints who were Encoacht for Heaven that sang for Joy. For in Christs Coach they sweetly sing; As they to Glory ride therein. Oh! joyous hearts! Enfir'de with holy Flame! Is speech thus tassled with praise? Will not your inward fire of Joy contain; That it in open flames doth blaze? For in Christ's Coach Saints sweetly sing, As they to Glory ride therein. And if a string do slip, by Chance, they soon Do screw it up again: whereby They set it in a more melodious Tune And a Diviner Harmony. For in Christs Coach they sweetly sing As they to Glory ride therein. In all their Acts, publick, and private, nay And secret too, they praise impart. But in their Acts Divine and Worship, they With Hymns do offer up their Heart. Thus in Christs Coach they sweetly sing As they to Glory ride therein. Some few not in; and some whose Time, and Place Block up this Coaches way do goe As Travellers afoot, and so do trace The Road that gives them right thereto While in this Coach these sweetly sing As they to Glory ride therein. Miscellaneous Poems [1.] [When] Let by rain. Ye Flippering Soule, Why dost between the Nippers dwell? Not stay, nor goe. Not yea, nor yet Controle. Doth this doe well? Rise journy'ng when the skies fall weeping Showers. Not o're nor under th'Clouds and Cloudy Powers. Not yea, nor noe: On tiptoes thus? Why sit on thorns? Resolve the matter: Stay thyselfe or goe. Be n't both wayes born. Wager thyselfe against thy surplice, see, And win thy Coate: or let thy Coate Win thee. Is this th'Effect, To leaven thus my Spirits all? To make my heart a Crabtree Cask direct? A Verjuicte Hall? As Bottle Ale, whose Spirits prisond nurst When jog'd, the bung with Violence doth burst? Shall I be made A sparkling Wildfire Shop Where my dull Spirits at the Fireball trade Do frisk and hop? And while the Hammer doth the Anvill pay, The fireball matter sparkles ery way. One sorry fret, An anvill Sparke, rose higher And in thy Temple falling almost set The house on fire. Such fireballs droping in the Temple Flame Burns up the building: Lord forbid the same. 2. Upon a Spider Catching a Fly. Thou sorrow, venom Elfe. Is this thy play, To spin a web out of thyselfe To Catch a Fly? For Why? I saw a pettish wasp Fall foule therein. Whom yet thy Whorle pins did not clasp Lest he should fling His sting. But as affraid, remote Didst stand hereat And with thy little fingers stroke And gently tap His back. Thus gently him didst treate Lest he should pet, And in a froppish, waspish heate Should greatly fret Thy net. Whereas the silly Fly, Caught by its leg Thou by the throate tookst hastily And 'hinde the head Bite Dead. This goes to pot, that not Nature doth call. Strive not above what strength hath got Lest in the brawle Thou fall. This Frey seems thus to us. Hells Spider gets His intrails spun to whip Cords thus And wove to nets And sets. To tangle Adams race In's stratigems To their Destructions, spoil'd, made base By venom things Damn'd Sins. But mighty, Gracious Lord Communicate Thy Grace to breake the Cord, afford Us Glorys Gate And State. We'l Nightingaile sing like When pearcht on high In Glories Cage, thy glory, bright, And thankfully, For joy. 3. Upon a Wasp Child with Cold. The Bare that breaths the Northern blast Did numb, Torpedo like, a Wasp Whose stiffend limbs encrampt, lay bathing In Sol's warm breath and shine as saving, Which with her hands she chafes and stands Rubbing her Legs, Shanks, Thighs, and hands. Her petty toes, and fingers ends Nipt with this breath, she out extends Unto the Sun, in greate desire To warm her digits at that fire. Doth hold her Temples in this state Where pulse doth beate, and head doth ake. Doth turn, and stretch her body small, Doth Comb her velvet Capitall. As if her little brain pan were A Volume of Choice precepts cleare. As if her sattin jacket hot Contained Apothecaries Shop Of Natures recepts, that prevails To remedy all her sad ailes, As if her velvet helmet high Did turret rationality. She fans her wing up to the Winde As if her Pettycoate were lin'de, With reasons fleece, and hoises sails And hu'ming flies in thankfull gails Unto her dun Curld palace Hall Her warm thanks offering for all. Lord cleare my misted sight that I May hence view thy Divinity. Some sparkes whereof thou up dost hasp Within this little downy Wasp In whose small Corporation wee A school and a schoolmaster see Where we may learn, and easily finde A nimble Spirit bravely minde Her worke in e'ry limb: and lace It up neate with a vitall grace, Acting each part though ne'er so small Here of this Fustian animall. Till I enravisht Climb into The Godhead on this Lather doe. Where all my pipes inspir'de upraise An Heavenly musick furrd with praise. 4. Huswifery. Make me, O Lord, thy Spining Wheele compleate. Thy Holy Worde my Distaff make for mee. Make mine Affections thy Swift Flyers neate And make my Soule thy holy Spoole to bee. My Conversation make to be thy Reele And reele the yarn thereon spun of thy Wheele. Make me thy Loome then, knit therein this Twine: And make thy Holy Spirit, Lord, winde quills: Then weave the Web thyselfe. The yarn is fine. Thine Ordinances make my Fulling Mills. Then dy the same in Heavenly Colours Choice, All pinkt with Varnisht Flowers of Paradise. Then cloath therewith mine Understanding, Will, Affections, Judgment, Conscience, Memory My Words, and Actions, that their shine may fill My wayes with glory and thee glorify. Then mine apparell shall display before yee That I am Cloathd in Holy robes for glory. 5. Another upon the Same. Make me thy Spinning Wheele of use for thee Make me thy Spinning Wheele of use for thee, Thy Grace my Distaffe, and my heart thy Spoole. Turn thou the wheele: let mine Affections bee The flyers filling with thy yarne my soule. Then weave the web of Grace in mee, thy Loome And Cloath my soule therewith, its Glories bloome. Make mee thy Loome: thy Grace the warfe therein, My duties Woofe, and let thy word winde Quills. The shuttle shoot. Cut off the ends my sins. Thy Ordinances make my fulling mills, My Life thy Web: and cloath me all my dayes With this Gold-web of Glory to thy praise. 6. Upon Wedlock, and Death of Children. A Curious Knot God made in Paradise, And drew it out inamled neatly Fresh. It was the True-Love Knot, more sweet than spice And set with all the flowres of Graces dress. Its Weddens Knot, that ne're can be unti'de. No Alexanders Sword can it divide. The slips here planted, gay and glorious grow: Unless an Hellish breath do sindge their Plumes. Here Primrose, Cowslips, Roses, Lilies blow With Violets and Pinkes that voide perfumes. Whose beautious leaves ore laid with Hony Dew. And Chanting birds Cherp out sweet Musick true. When in this Knot I planted was, my Stock Soon knotted, and a manly flower out brake. And after it my branch again did knot Brought out another Flowre its sweet breathd mate. One knot gave one tother the tothers place. Whence Checkling smiles fought in each others face. But oh! a glorious hand from glory came Guarded with Angells, soon did Crop this flowre Which almost tore the root up of the same At that unlookt for, Dolesome, darksome houre. In Pray're to Christ perfum'de it did ascend, And Angells bright did it to heaven tend. But pausing on't, this sweet perfum'd my thought, Christ would in Glory have a Flowre, Choice, Prime, And having Choice, chose this my branch forth brought. Lord take't. I thanke thee, thou takst ought of mine, It is my pledg in glory, part of mee Is now in it, Lord, glorifi'de with thee. But praying ore my branch, my branch did sprout And bore another manly flower, and gay And after that another, sweet brake out, The which the former hand soon got away. But oh! the tortures, Vomit, screechings, groans, And six weeks Fever would pierce hearts like stones. Griefe o're doth flow: and nature fault would finde Were not thy Will, my Spell Charm, Joy, and Gem: That as I said, I say, take, Lord, they're thine. I piecemeale pass to Glory bright in them. I joy, may I sweet Flowers for Glory breed, Whether thou getst them green, or lets them seed. 7. The Ebb and Flow. When first thou on me Lord wrought'st thy Sweet Print, My heart was made thy tinder box. My 'ffections were thy tinder in't. Where fell thy Sparkes by drops. Those holy Sparks of Heavenly Fire that came Did ever catch and often out would flame. But now my Heart is made thy Censar trim, Full of thy golden Altars fire, To offer up Sweet Incense in Unto thyselfe intire: I finde my tinder scarce thy sparks can feel That drop out from thy Holy flint and Steel. Hence doubts out bud for feare thy fire in mee 'S a mocking Ignis Fatuus Or lest thine Altars fire out bee, Its hid in ashes thus. Yet when the bellows of thy Spirit blow Away mine ashes, then thy fire doth glow. 8. Upon the Sweeping Flood Aug: 13. 14. 1683. Dated as above. Oh! that Id had a tear to've quencht that flame Which did dissolve the Heavens above Into those liquid drops that Came To drown our Carnall love. Our cheeks were dry and eyes refusde to weep. Tears bursting out ran down the skies darke Cheek. Were th'Heavens sick? must wee their Doctors bee And physick them with pills, our sin? To make them purg and Vomit, see, And Excrements out fling? We've griev'd them by such Physick that they shed Their Excrements upon our lofty heads. A Funerall Poem Upon the Death of my ever Endeared, and Tender Wife Mrs. Elizabeth Taylor, Who fell asleep in Christ the 7th day of July at night about two hours after Sun setting 1689 and in the 39 yeare of her Life. PART. 1. My Gracious Lord, I Licence of thee Crave, Not to repine but drop upon the Grave Of my Deare Wife a Teare, or two: or wash Thy Milk White hand in tears that downward pass. Thou summond hast her Noble part away: And in Salt Tears I would Embalm her Clay. Some deem Death doth the True Love Knot unty: But I do finde it harder tide thereby. My heart is in't and will be squeez'd therefore To pieces if thou draw the Ends much more. Oh strange Untying! it ti'th harder: What? Can anything unty a True Love Knot? Five Babes thou tookst from me before this Stroake. Thine arrows then into my bowells broake, But now they pierce into my bosom smart, Do strike and stob me in the very heart. I'de then my bosom Friend a Comfort, and To Comfort: Yet my Lord, I kiss thy hand. I Her resign'd, thou tookst her into thine, Out of my bosom, yet she dwells in mine: And though her Precious Soule now swims in bliss, Yet while grim Death, that Dismall Sergeant is, Between the Parts Essentiall now remote, And hath this stately Tabernacle broke My Harp is turnd to mourning: Organ sweet Is turn'de into the Voice of them that weep. Griefe swelling girds the Heart Strings where its purst, Unless it Vent the Vessell sure will burst. My Gracious Lord, grant that my bitter Griefe Breath through this little Vent hole for reliefe. PART. 2. My Dear, Deare Love, reflect thou no such thing, Will Griefe permit you at my Grave to sing? Oh! Black Black Theme! The Girths of Griefe alone Do gird my heart till Gust of Sorrows groan And dash a mournfull Song to pieces on The Dolefull Face of thy Sepulcher Stone. My Onely DOVE, though Harp and Harrow, loe, Better agree than Songs and Sorrows doe, Yet spare me thus to drop a blubber'd Verse Out of my Weeping Eyes Upon thy Herse. What shall my Preface to our True Love Knot Frisk in Acrostick Rhimes? And may I not Now at our parting, with Poetick knocks Break a salt teare to pieces as it drops? Did Davids bitter Sorrow at the Dusts Of Jonathan raise such Poetick gusts? Do Emperours interr'd in Verses lie? And mayn't such Feet run from my Weeping Eye? Nay, Dutie lies upon mee much; and shall I in thy Coffin naile thy Vertues all? How shall thy Babes, and theirs, thy Vertuous shine Know, or Persue unless I them define? Thy Grace will Grace unto a Poem bee Although a Poem be no grace to thee. Impute it not a Crime then if I weep A Weeping Poem on thy Winding Sheet. Maybe some Angell may my Poem sing To thee in Glory, or relate the thing, Which if he do, my mournfull Poem may Advance thy Joy, and my Deep Sorrow lay. PART. 3. Your Ears, Bright Saints, and Angells: them I Choose To stough her Praises in: I'le not abuse. Her Modesty would blush should you profess, I in Hyperboles her praises dress. Wherefore as Cramping Griefe permitts to stut Them forth accept of such as here I put. Her Husbands Joy, Her Childrens Chiefe Content. Her Servants Eyes, Her Houses Ornament. Her Shine as Child, as Neighbour, flies abroad As Mistress, Mother, Wife, her Walke With God. As Child she was a Tender, Pious Bud Of Pious Parents, sprang of Pious Blood Two Grandsires, Gran'ams: one or two, she had A Father too and Mother, that englad The Gracious heart to thinke upon, they were Bright Pillars in Gods Temple shining cleare. Her Father, and her Mothers Father fix As shining Stars in Golden Candlesticks. She did Obedient, Tender, Meek Child prove The Object of her Fathers Eye, and Love. Her Mother being Dead, her heart would melt When she her Fathers looks not pleasant felt. His smile Would her enliven, Frown, down pull Hence she became his Child most Dutifull. As Neighbour, she was full of Neighbourhood Not Proud, or Strang; Grave, Courteous, ever good. Compassionate: but unto none was Soure. Her Fingers dropt with Myrrh, oft, to her power. As Mistress she order'd her Family With all Discretion, and most prudently In all things prompt: Dutie in this respect Would to the meanest in it not neglect. Ripe at her Fingers Ends, Would nothing flinch. She was a neate good Huswife every inch. Although her weakenesse made her let alone Things so to go, as made her fetch a groan. Remiss was not, nor yet severe unto Her Servants: but i'th' golden mean did goe. As Mother, Oh! What tender Mother She? Her bowells Boiled ore to them that bee Bits of her tender Bowells. She a share Of her affections ever made them ware. Yet never chose to trick them, nor herselfe In antick garbs; or Lavishness of Wealth. But was a Lover much of Comeliness: And with her Needle work would make their Dress. The Law of Life within her Lips she would Be dropping forth upon them as shee should. Foolishly fond she was not but would give Correction wisely, that their Soules might Live. As Wife, a Tender, Tender, Loving, Meet, Meeke, Patient, Humble, Modest, Faithfull, Sweet Endearing Help she was: Whose Chiefest Treasure Of Earthly things she held her Husbands pleasure. But if she spi'de displeasure in his face, Sorrow would spoile her own, and marr its grace. Dear Heart! She would his Joy, Peace, Honour, Name, Even as her very Life, seeke to mentain. And if an hasty word by chance dropt in: She would in secret sigh it or'e with him. She was not wedded unto him alone But had his joy, and sorrow as her own. She, where he chanc'd to miss, a Cover would lay Yet would in Secret fore him all Display In meekness of sweet wisdom, and by Art, As Certainly would winde into the heart. She laid her neck unto the Yoake he draws: And was his Faithfull Yoake Mate, in Christ's Cause. As to her walk with God, she did inherit The very Spirits of her Parents Spirit. She was no gaudy Christian, or gilt Weed: But was a Reall, Israelite indeed. When in her Fathers house God toucht her Heart, That Trembling Frame of Spirit, and that Smart, She then was under very, few did know: Whereof she somewhat to the Church did show. Repentance now's her Work: Sin poyson is: Faith, carries her to Christ as one of his. Fear Temples in her heart; Love flowers apace To God, Christ, Grace Saints, and the Means of Grace. She's much in Reading, Pray're, Selfe-Application Holds humbly up, a pious Conversation In which she makes profession Which unto Westfield Church she did disclose. Holy in Health; Patient in Sickness long. And very great. Yet gracious Speech doth throng: She oft had up, An Alwise God Doth this. And in a filiall way the Rod would kiss. When Pains were Sore, Justice can do no wrong, Nor Mercy Cruell be; became her Song. The Doomsday Verses much perfum'de her Breath, Much in her thoughts, and yet she fear'd not Death. An Elegy upon the Death of that Holy and Reverend Man of God, Mr. Samuel Hooker, . Pastor of the Church of Christ at Farmington, (and Son to the Famous Mr. Thomas Hooker, who was a Pastor of, and began with the Church of Christ at Hartford on Connecticut in New England) who slept in Christ, the 6th day of November, about one a Clock in the morning in the 64 year of his age entered upon. Annoque Domini 1697 [PART. 1.] Griefe sometimes is a duty yet when Greate And geteth vent, it Non-Sense sobs, doth speake Cutting off Sentences by Enterjections Made by the force of hard beset Affections. Should I in mine pass through this Hemisphere And beg of ev'ry Eye a Trickling teare To wash thy Tombe, Deare Hooker, bright therein, All would not Drown the Griefe that thence doth spring. Shall thy Choice Name here not embalmed ly In those Sweet Spices whose perfumes do fly From thy greate Excellence? It surely would Be Sacraledge thy Worth back to withhold. Lord spare the Flock. Shall brave brave Jon'than dy? And David's place be empty? Sling ly by? Before their heads those Almond Trees are white And ere they're mellow'd by old age's weight? When Birds new Hatcht ware, as in nest they ly, Presbytick Down, Pinfeatherd Prelacy (Young Cockerills, whose Combs soare up like Spires That force their Dams: and Crow against their Sires?) Dost thou withdraw? and now? Where are thy Spurs Then to be had? Whose sight would work demurrs. Where hast thou left thy Strenth, and Potency? And Congregationall Artillery? We need the Same, and need it more and more. For Babels Canons 'gainst our Bulworks roare. [PART.] 2. TO NEW ENGLAND. Alas! alas! New England go weep. Thy loss is greate in him: For he did keep Within thine Orb as a bright shining Sun To give thee Light, but now his race is run. And though his Epicycle was but small His shining Beams did fly to lighten all. He was in Person neat, of lesser Sise, With Ruddy Looks, and with quick rowling eyes. His Head a Magazeen of Wisdom rich, With Spirits fand from foggy Vapors which Do Reason cloud: a Fine spun Fancy, Quick, Producing Notions brave, and Rhetorick. A Son of such a Father, whose name Flew Like sweet Perfume o're Englands Old, and New. A Son, though youngest, yet that did inherit, A noble portion of his Fathers Spirit, Wise, Pious, Prudent, had a Strong, Cleare Head, That entertaind the Strength of what he red. Grave, not Morose, Courteous; yet did Command A Distance due: and by a gentle hand. Not Verbous, yet, his lips would oft distill Brave Apophthegms: Facete Wit, and Skill. In Councill Choice, deliberate, and full. In Disputation, Acute. Home, not Dull Meek as a Lamb, yet as a Lion, hee Could put on Majesty, if't needs must bee. Keen in Rebukes yet Candid, Corrosive Where Cases calld, would to the bottom rive. A True Peace-Maker, Farmington may say, Offt in the fire and Flame of others fray Calazy-Gem like quencht it. And as fring'd With Salamanders Woole, he was not sindg'd. He steady was: Not on, and Off. His Minde John Baptist like's no Reed shook with the Winde. Concocted not, though neatly minced Slops, A mess of Windmills, or of Weather-Cocks. Not Esau like selling his choice Free Sockage Then left his Birthright for a bowl of Pottage. He, and the best of Queens, we thus describe'm Agreeing in one Motto Semper idem. A Box of Jewells, string of Pearls bright, High. Of Heavenly Graces a sweet Spicery. Humble, and full of selfe abasement, though Such Excellency did in him e're flow. A Rich Divine: a Pastour very choice Dispensing Grace, with a sweet piercing voice (Like to the still small Voice Elijah heard) That rended Rocks, and Satans Intrest marr'd. In Prayre sweet, the musick of which String Celestiall Wealth unto the Earth would bring Like little Paul in Person, Voice, and Grace Advancing Christ and sinfull things out race. The Sacred Writ with joy he did attend. And Scriptures dropt even at his fingers end. A Weighty Preacher: never notion Sick: An Angel in a Golden Candlestick. He had the knack of Preaching: and did dart Christs fiery Shafts into the flinty heart; Till it was broken: Then the smarting wound Would dress with Gilliads Balm to make it sound. The Gospell Bow and balsom well he knewâ Barjona was; and Boanerges true. Great Gregry, its said, did Peters Coffin Wrest Wide ope, and found his Keyes in't. (Ah! well Blesst) But Hooker bravely handed Aaron Rod Christ's own Choice Keyes, and gently, and for God. A Loving Husband; tender Father, who In sweet affections oft would overflow With Pious, Rich Discourse, that was well spic'd With Gospell Grace, to bring them up to Christ. And holy Counsill on them he would shoure With Death Bed Charges till his dying hour. But seing Death Creep on his Fingers ends, And on his Hands, and Arms, bespake his Friends Thus, saying, They are Dead, you see, and I Have done with them: warm cloaths thereto apply, But Death admits no check mate. Out he poures His Soul on Christ. On him they weep in showers. But art thou gone, Brave Hooker, hence? and Why? What, wast thou weary of thy Ministry? Or weari'd out by thy fed flock? Alas! Or did the Countrey's Sins it bring to pass? He was a Samuel in his place, and breath. Let Israel do him honour at his Death. Mourn, mourn, New England, alas! alas! To see thy Freckled Face in Gospell Glass: To feele thy Pulse, and finde thy Spleen's not well: Whose Vapors cause thy Pericordium t'swell: Do suffocat, and Cramp thee, and grow worse By Hypochondrik Passions of the purse, Affect thy Brains toucht with the Turn, till thou Halfe sick of Preachers false, and Gospell Plow. Such Symptoms say, if nothing else will ease, Thy Sickness soon will cure thy sad Disease. For when such Studs, as stop, and scotch the Way Of thy Declensions are remoov'd thy bay, Apostasy wherewith thou art thus driven Unto the tents of Presbyterianism (Which is refined Prelacy at best) Will not stay long here in her tents, and rest, But o're this Bridge will carry thee apace Into the Realm of Prelates arch, the place Where open Sinners vile unmaskt indeed Are Welcom Guests (if they can say the Creed) Unto Christs Table, While they can their Sins Atone in Courts by offering Silverlings. Watch, Watch thou then: Reform thy life: Refine Thyselfe from thy Declentions. Tend thy line. Steeples ware Weathercocks: but Turrits gain An Happiness under a Faithfull Vane. And weep thy Sins away, lest woe be nigh. For Angells with thy Lots away do high. PART. 3. TO CONNECTICUT. Mourn, mourn, Connecticut; thou'st lost a Gem; A Carbuncle, (and thou hast few of them) Is fallen from thy Crown, a Sun full bright Is set, bidding thine Horizon good night. Mourn Hartford, mourn; a bud of thine is gone: A Gem that grew on thy Foundation Stone (Not Stone's, but Hooker's who did in thee Shine In Light, Life, Line, and Gospell Discipline) Who griev'd to see thee warpe from thy foundation And leave thy first Love thus, and Education. Of all thy Sons thou hast not such another To stay thy Head, and heart from ill recover. PART. 4. Alas poor Farmington, of all the rest Most Happy, and Unhappy, Blesst unblesst: Most Happy having such an Happiness: And most unhappy losing of no less. Oh! mourn, and weep, remember thou the Call Thy Prophet gave thee to't before his fall. Oh Daughter of my people, (that last text) Gird thee with Sackcloth, Wallow thee perplext In ashes. Mourn thou lamentably As for an onely Son: weep bitterly, For lo, the Spoiler suddenly shall come Upon us. And his Sermon being done The motive to the Call, the Prophesy Had an accomplishment before your eye. For he much spent desired you to sing A Psalm while he refresht and rested him, Which done he prayed over you intent, Dismist you with a blessing briefe, and bent Under the Spoiler down that suddenly Assaulted him. And gave discharg thereby Unto his pulpit from all right of Claim For ever after in this man of Fame. He bowing goes unto a neighbours, whence After a while he rideth home from thence Betook him to his dying Bed perfum'd With prayers to God, and Charges he assum'd And laid his friends and Wife and Children under While five dayes run, and Illiak pains did thunder. That Hooker now by this sharp tyranny Forcing things back that should go on, should dy Lord grant it be n't an Omen of our Fate Foreshewing our apostate following State. Then mourn poore Church, thy Prophets race is run As for a Father, or an onely Son. After three tens, and seven years were past Under thy rocky hill by him, at last He thus doth leave thee. Search into thy Sin, Repent, and grieve that ere thou grievedst him, Or rather God in him, lest suddenly The Spoiler still should on thee come and stroy. Lord, art thou angry with the Flock, that thou Dost slay their Shephard? Or dost disallow The Fold, and lay it Common that thou smite Down dost the shory that upheld it right? Shall angling cease? And no more fish be took That thou callst home thy Hooker with his Hook? Lord, spare the flock: uphold the fold from falling. Send out another Hooker of this Calling. PART. 5. TO THE FAMILY RELICT. Thou mourning Family, what shall I say? Shall Passion, or compassion o're me sway? It is a day of Griefe: Tears are a Dress Becoming us, come they not to excess. Then keep due measure. Should you too much bring, Your too much is too little far for him. Thou mourning Widdow! oh! how sad? how sharp? Poor bleeding Soule! how turned is thy Harp Into the Voice of mourning? Organ sweet Into the bitter Voice of them that weep. But yet cheere up: New England layes her head To thine, to weep with thee over thy Dead. Thou may'st therefore spend fewer tears of Sorrow Out of thine own, thou dost so many borrow. Christs Napkin take, Graces green Taffity And wipe therewith, thy Weeping, watry eye And thou shalt see thy Hooker all ore gay With Christ in bliss, adorn'd with Glories Ray, And putting out his shining hand to thee Saying, My Honey, mourn no more for mee. That Love wrongs both, that wills mee with thee hence. But joy to see my Joy, and Glory mence. In Faith, Obedience, Patience, walk awhile And thou shalt soon leape ore the parting Stile, And come to God, Christ, Angells, Saints, and Mee. So wee in Bliss together e're shall bee. When we did wed, we each a mortall took. And ever from that day for this did look Wherein we parted are; and one should have Griefe, I o're thy, or thou over my grave. The Lot is cast on thee. I first must go And leave thee weeping o're my Grave in woe. But stay thy Sorrow: bless my Babes. Obey. And soon thou shall with mee enjoy good day. And as for you his Buds, and Blossoms blown, Stems of his Root, his very Flesh and Bone, You needs must have great droopings, now the Tree Is fallen down the boughs whereof you bee. You have a Father lost, and Choice one too. Weeping for him is honour due from you. Yet let your Sorrows run in godly wise As if his Spirits tears fell from your eyes. Strive for his Spirit: rather Christ's, than His To dwell, and act his Flesh, yourselves, to bliss. Its pitty these in him conjoyn'd, up grew Together, should be parted here in you. Plants of a Noble Vine, a Right, Right Seed. Oh! turn not to a Strange Wild vine or Weed. Your Grand sire were a Chiefe Foundation Stone In this Blesst Building: Father was well known To be a Chiefe Good Builder in the Same And with his might did ever it mentain. Your Grandsire's Spirit through your Father breathd In Life, on you, and as his Life he leav'd, Striving to breath into your hearts his Spirit As out of him it passed, to inherit. Be n't like such babes as parents brains out pull To make a Wassill Bowle then of the Skull. That Pick their Parents eyes out, and the holes Stuff up with folly, as if no braind Souls. You are of better form than this sad guise Yet beare this Caution: Some apostatise. And strive your Sires, and Grandsires Life and Line Through you their Flesh and blood may brightly shine. Imminde your Father's Death bed Charge and aime. You are his Very Flesh, and Blood, and Name. The name of hooker precious in our story Make you more precious, adding to its Glory, At the Bright flaming Sun of Righteousness, With a Celestiall Light, e're burning fresh. A Cabbinet of Vertue, ever brave. A Magazeen of Counsill, Weighty, Grave. A Treasury of Grace, th'Imbroideries Of th'Holy Ghost in Heart, and Life here lies. A Temple bright of Piety in print, To glorify that God that dwelled in't. A Stage of War, Whereon the Spirits Sword Hew'd down the Hellish foes that did disturb. A Cage whose bird of Paradise therein Did sing sweete Musick forth to glories King. A Silver Trumpet of the Temple bright Blown by an Angell of Celestiall light A Temple deckt, and with all graces spic'de For God the Father, Spirit, and for Christ. A Golden Pulpit Where an Angell Choice Preacht Zions Grace with Sinai's thundering voice. An Oratore of Prayre, which, rapt up, hopt Up Souls to Heaven, Heaven down to Souls oft knockt. Were there a Metempsychosis, we say Greate Hookers Soule, sure, once possest this Clay. Elijah's Mantle: and the dust that fell Of th'Charriot, and the Horse of Israel, Scarce ever dust more glorious made for bliss With glorious Grace, or better usd than this, That here now stript of all that Wealth, and Station Doth lie, yet firmly holds its high Relation. And here we leave it, till the last Dayes Shoute Breaking its Coffin brings it glorious out. And wipe those drops wrung from thy Winding Sheet Brave Sir, off from our Eyes, that weeping keep, With thy White Lawn thou wearst in Glory Gay, Charming our Griefe therewith, Amen we say. HIS EPITAPH. A turffe of Glory, Rich Celestiall Dust, A Bit of Christ here in Death's Cradle husht. An Orb of Heavenly Sunshine: a bright Star That never glimmerd: ever shining faire, A Paradise bespangled all with Grace: A Curious Web o'relaid with holy lace A Magazeen of Prudence: Golden Pot Of Gracious Flowers never to be forgot Farmingtons Glory, and its Pulpits Grace Lies here a Chrystallizing till the trace Of Time is at an end and all out run. Then shall arise and quite outshine the Sun. A Fig for thee Oh! Death. Thou King of Terrours with thy Gastly Eyes With Butter teeth, bare bones Grim looks likewise. And Grizzly Hide, and clawing Tallons, fell, Opning to Sinners Vile, Trap Door of Hell, That on in Sin impenitently trip The Downfall art of the infernall Pit, Thou struckst thy teeth deep in my Lord's blest Side: Who dasht it out, and all its venom 'stroyde That now thy Poundrill shall onely dash My Flesh and bones to bits, and Cask shall clash. Thou'rt not so frightfull now to me, thy knocks Do crack my shell. Its Heavenly kernells box Abides most safe. Thy blows do break its shell, Thy Teeth its Nut. Cracks are that on it fell. Thence out its kirnell fair and nut, by worms Once Viciated out, new formd forth turns And on the wings of some bright Angell flies Out to bright glory of Gods blissfull joyes. Hence thou to mee with all thy Gastly face Art not so dreadfull unto mee through Grace. I am resolvde to fight thee, and ne'er yield, Blood up to th'Ears; and in the battle field Chasing thee hence: But not for this my flesh, My Body, my vile harlot, its thy Mess, Labouring to drown me into Sin, disguise By Eating and by drinking such evill joyes Though Grace preserv'd mee that I nere have Surprised been nor tumbled in such grave. Hence for my strumpet I'le ne'er draw my Sword Nor thee restrain at all by Iron Curb Nor for her safty will I 'gainst thee strive But let thy frozen gripes take her Captive And her imprison in thy dungeon Cave And grinde to powder in thy Mill the grave, Which powder in thy Van thou'st safely keep Till she hath slept out quite her fatall Sleep. When the last Cock shall Crow the last day in And the Arch Angells Trumpets sound shall ring Then th'Eye Omniscient seek shall all there round Each dust death's mill had very finely ground, Which in death's smoky furnace well refinde And Each to'ts fellow hath exactly joyn't, Is raised up anew and made all bright And Christalized; all top full of delight. And entertains its Soule again in bliss And Holy Angells waiting all on this, The Soule and Body now, as two true Lovers Ery night how do they hug and kiss each other. And going hand in hand thus through the skies Up to Eternall glory glorious rise. Is this the Worst thy terrours then canst, why Then should this grimace at me terrify? Why camst thou then so slowly? Mend thy pace. Thy Slowness me detains from Christ's bright face. Although thy terrours rise to th'highst degree, I still am where I was, a Fig for thee.</field>
