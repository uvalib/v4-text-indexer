      <field name="fulltext">BENEVOLENCE, AND GRATITUDE: A POEM. TO MY BENEFACTORS, AND BENEFACRESSES. Descend cÅlestial Muse! my Song inspire; With sentiments sublime, my bosom fire, To sing the gifts conferr'd on human race; With gratitude the streams of bliss to trace, Back to the fount of inexhausted love; Who, with all-bounteous kindness from above, Show'rs blessings down, benevolently meant, To make men happy, chearful, and content. And teach me in a proper light to place Those brightest ornaments of human race; Who can, with great benignity of heart, To their inferiors happiness impart: Who, by their actions, which from pity flow, Resemble most their Maker here below: And when I shall the pleasing task begin, Awake each grateful sentiment within. E'er time began his destin'd course to run With steady pace; or the unweary'd sun Shone round the world, to give the nations light, Confusion reign'd, and black tremendous night. Then, e'er Omnipotence created man, As wisdom pre-design'd the noble plan; God's spirit mov'd wide o'er the pregnant deep, Gave chaos laws, and lull'd uproar asleep. Let there be gladsome light diffus'd abroad, So spake th' omnipotent creating God: Wide thro' all space the great command was heard, From gloom divided heav'nly light appear'd; And day God call'd the sweet all-chearing light, On darkness he impos'd the name of night: This the prime day of time, so call'd by man, When wisdom first its wond'rous works began. God's fiat next produc'd the lofty sky Of azure blue, and hung the roof on high; Above the arch unbounded waters roll; Below, earth's ocean stretch'd from pole to pole; This was the second day, in which we read, Creating wisdom its great pow'r display'd. God spake, and congregating waters hear, In channels roll, and let dry land appear; Waters obedient, sunk within their bound; The land emerg'd, with verdure yet uncrown'd: God saw 'twas good, and every thing did please, Call'd dry land earth, and call'd the waters seas: At his command, the world was clad around With grass, herbs, trees, sprung from the teeming ground; Each in its kind, seed yielding herbs for food; Trees yielding fruit, and God beheld it good: This was perform'd before the third day's close, In which the wonders of creation rose. Let there be lights, said God, in heav'n display'd, To rule the day, and chear the gloomy shade, And let them be for signs, days, seasons, years; It was his will, and what he wills appears: The sun, and moon, now first began their round, With stars unnumber'd, Heav'n's expanse was crown'd: Launch'd from their Maker's hand, they ceaseless glow, Unerring roll, and send their light below: Thro' boundless space refulgent glories shine, And speak their Maker wise, immense, divine: This the fourth day, by Moses we are taught, Creating wisdom's mighty fiat wrought. Let waters breed of living creatures store, Said God, and fowls, in air aloft to soar; Rivers brought forth, and seas, from shore to shore. His fiat rais'd (as wisdom predesign'd) The feather'd fowls on wing, of ev'ry kind; Created whales, and all the num'rous brood Of moving creatures in the briny flood: He bless'd the whole, (let men his goodness praise) Be fruitful, multiply, fill earth, air, seas: On this fifth day, these creatures rose to view, When big with life the seas, and rivers grew. Let earth bring forth, said Heav'n's eternal King, Cattle, and beasts, and ev'ry creeping thing, Each in its kind, the earth obedient heard; Cattle, and beasts, and creeping things appear'd. Naked to view the grand production stood, Compleatly whole, and God beheld it good. His next great work was lordly man to make; As if in council, thus the God-head spake; Man let us make, divinely form'd, erect, Him, as their Lord, let all below respect; With winged fowls, subjected to him thrown, Strong and fierce beasts, shall his dominion own, With whatsoever moveth in the sea, Or creeps on earth, shall feel his sov'reign sway; So God created man with upright heart, In his own image, of himself a part; Breath'd vital warmth, and vigor, thro' the whole, And straightway man became a living soul: He deign'd the creature of his love to fill With reason, mem'ry, understanding, will; And added this great benediction too, Be fruitful, multiply; the earth subdue; Beasts, fishes, fowls, and ev'ry living thing, Shall all submit, and own their earthly king: The benediction operates we see; For none can null Jehovah's firm decree. Omnipotence the whole creation view'd, Unerring wisdom saw 'twas very good: Thus in six days Vide the first chapter of Genesis. the mighty fiat wrought, And to perfection all creation brought. Now, man supply'd by God's benevolence, With ev'ry thing delectable to sense, Was plac'd in Vide the second chapter of Genesis. paradise, as lord of all, Ruler supreme o'er this terraqueous ball. The solitary monarch, tho' possess'd Of all the world, was not compleatly bless'd: Kind heav'n had yet the greatest bliss in store; Its last best gift; and man cou'd wish no more; He said, to whom all nature's laws are known, It is not Vide the second chapter of Genesis. fit that man shou'd be alone; For him I'll make a delicate helpmeet, To give him joy, and render life more sweet: From Adam's side, lock'd up in sleep profound, God took a rib, and clos'd the harmless wound: Beneath the Maker's hand, that rib became Man's second self, but of a softer frame; Wisdom seem'd pleas'd, and led her deck'd with charms And native innocence, to Adam's arms, Who said, when he the lovely object view'd, Absorb'd in joy, and full of gratitude! This is my flesh, my bone, from me she came; Woman shall be the charming creature's name; Fathers, and mothers, future men shall leave, And to their wives with fond affection cleave; They twain shall be one flesh, by friendship ty'd, One heart, one soul, one sentiment shall guide; One shall they be, in sacred mystic sense, In kindness, love, and sweet benevolence: This dear companion, charming bosom friend, With pleasure, life's corroding cares shall blend; Her converse shall intruding griefs alloy; In her shall center all terrestrial joy. Let spiteful satyrists their brains perplex, And rail in rhime against that lovely sex; Let them despise our mother Eve, and call Her auth'ress of our father Adam's fall: From thence, thro' ev'ry age their plan pursue, And set the most detestable to view: To match each female, search the world around, Men equally pernicious may be found; And 'tis a bold assertion to declare, That Adam wou'd have shunn'd the tempter's snare; We may suppose had woman never been, Man would no doubt have try'd this mode of sin, Wou'd in th' unbeaten path alone have trod, Proud to become a sublunary God: Let this suffice to baffle all dispute, And strike th' envenom'd tongue of slander mute, The promis'd Vide the third chapter of Genesis, verse 16. advocate, th' incarnate God, Upon the serpent's head victorious trod; Thro' her bless'd Vide the third chapter of Genesis, verse 16. seed who for our ransom dy'd, We rise immortal, amply justify'd. Let th' avaricious, impotent, and old, Whose summum bonum centers all in gold, Let mole-ey'd stoics cold neglect assume, Whose optics woman never cou'd illume; Who, during life, might stupid stand and gaze On fascinating eyes, and beauty's blaze, Nor feel one gleam rush on their dazzled sight, From living orbs of captivating light; Who, never felt the least delight to hear The conversation of the well taught fair; But deaf as adders to the charmer's song, Heed not the most melodious female's tongue, With music bless'd, or cloath'd with solid sense, Or arm'd with pleasing prattling eloquence. Let those, t' whom niggard nature has deny'd Th' endearing joys of passions gratify'd, Let Farinellis and Platonics boast, With souls engender'd on cold Greenland's coast, Whose almost stagnant blood, from its first source, Rolls in a languid tide its wonted course A gelid principle, which never darts Its animating fire, to distant parts, That they can live with women here below, Despise their charms, nor feel an am'rous glow; This only will their impotence display, Not take one jot of sterling worth away. The brave returning from rough wars alarms, Impatient fly to charming womens arms; The king, the peasant, statesman, and the sage, Have thought no joy like them in ev'ry age; Search from the torrid to the frigid zone, A greater pleasure never yet was known: To meanest slaves who drudge from morn till night, A smiling woman gives supreme delight, Charms in the midst of toil, and on her breast, In sweet oblivion lulls their griefs to rest. Increase and multiply, and fill the land, Was the benign Creator's first command: Woman was made, destin'd to be belov'd, And men in gen'ral have the gift approv'd; The major part, have thought the fair to be The charming summit of felicity. Thus have I sung, and gratefully set forth Jehovah's love, (and darling woman's worth,) Display'd his goodness, who, on wisdom's plan, First built the world, e'er he created man, Bespangled heav'n with stars, fill'd earth, air, seas With ev'ry thing, to gratify, and please, And gave to man an helpmeet, she might prove All joys compris'd in amicable love. Which shou'd, I think, induce us to declare, How sensible of benefits we are, In deeds, and words, our gratitude to shew From creatures, to the great Creator due. This debt of all, this prime grand tribute paid, Grant me Urania! thine inspiring aid, To sing their worth, whose ample souls we know, Feel true seraphic charitable glow: Where affability, and kindness meet; With godlike mercy, and compassion sweet: Void of detraction, calumny, and spite, Worse than the most envenom'd adder's bite. For method's sake, that I more fully may Those laudable good qualities display; I shall at first an effort make to paint Th' ingrateful person, proud, malevolent; 'Gainst which in contrast may be better view'd, Godlike benevolence, and gratitude: And this I dare affirm whene'er the two, Are plac'd in any proper point of view, This virtue, cloath'd in robes of noblest worth, That vice, in all its turpitude set forth, Wou'd equal in comparison be found, No more than a neglected piece of ground, On whose poor soil a stony surface lies, 'Mongst which thorns, thistles, nettles, Briars, rise, Compar'd against a tract of fertile land, Dress'd, till'd, and manag'd, by some able hand, Where plants, fruits, flow'rs arise, the field t'adorn, Or yellow ridges wave of standing corn. To hear without a sympathizing sigh, The wretched paupers for assistance cry; To see unmov'd, unmerited distress, And not a sign of tenderness t'express; To give advice with a malignant will, Design'd to do th' advised person ill; By winks, shrugs, nods, and innuendos vile, Full of uncharitable sland'ring guile, To strive to lay an undeserved blame On any one, to blast unsully'd fame, (Which delicate possessors value more, Than greedy misers bags of golden ore;) To make black calumny the darling theme, To be the foremost, loudly to proclaim What others do, and with intention sly, Their inadvertencies to magnify; To construe words quite wrong, and to declare, Unmeaning looks a fraudful meaning wear; To wish, hope, think the worst, and grow elate, When male or female neighbours deviate From rectitude, and strongly tempted make Thro' ignorance, or frailty, some mistake; Humanum est errare to forget, (For ev'ry living soul a sentence fit;) Who does all this, may well be deem'd to be Uncharitable in a great degree; These qualities denote in truest sense, A sordid heart fraught with malevolence; And black ingratitude is near ally'd To avarice, and self-sufficient pride: An avaricious heart, full well 'tis known, Is never satisfy'd with favours shown: As soon will death, and th' insatiate grave, Declare it is enough, and cease to crave, As he that's puff'd with self-sufficient pride And curs'd with avarice, be satisfy'd: Nor will the proud of heart e'er condescend, T'acknowledge the most gen'rous hearted friend, Has any favours shown, or great, or small, But what his merit far outweigh'd them all. O! that it was impossible to find Such barren rude uncultivated mind, Unmov'd by benefits bestow'd to show Some faint expressions of a grateful glow! But this we see, whene'er we look around, Such monsters are 'mongst men and women found, The parrot, daw, canary bird, and dove, Return their benefactors love for love; Chirp, flutter, prattle, coo, and strive t'express By gestures apt, their inward happiness; Grateful they bend, smooth'd by their owner's hand, Or pearch'd thereon, exulting gayly stand. Pards, lions, tygers, ev'ry beast of prey, With gratitude man's kindnesses repay, Throw off their savage fierceness at command, Gently they crouch, and lick their feeder's hand, And seldom, prompted by ingratitude, Will tear the hand that gives them daily food. The feather'd, and the quadrupeded kind, Repeated acts of kindnesses can bind, And make them act as nature first design'd. Of ev'ry living creature here below, On man, and woman only, we bestow This epithet, and make th' assertion good, Proud grov'ling monsters of ingratitude! The genial show'rs, and Sol's warm rays produce Throughout the spacious earth, things fit for use, Some parts excepted, and amongst the worst, Afric, with burning sands, and monsters curst, Teems with rank weeds, and a vast pois'nous brood; So ranc'rous men, fraught with ingratitude, With base malevolence incessant glow; And whilst their benefactors oft bestow Great benefits, with an obliging smile, Their gloomy hearts, like slimy muddy Nile, O'erflow with pride, and black infernal guile! As a poor traveller, that miss'd his way, In a thick wood, at the decline of day, Walks slowly on, and cautiously proceeds Through briars, thorns, and rankest noxious weeds, Whilst savage beasts of prey, that nightly prowl, Traverse the forest, and discordant howl: So, cheerless I the dismal prospect view'd, Malevolence, and black ingratitude Op'd to my view, and like that trav'ler made A progress thro' the barren gloomy shade; As he emerges with the rising day, From that drear place, and hast'ning on his way, Enjoys the prospect fertile nature yields, In gardens, groves, and cultivated fields; So with that most distasteful subject cloy'd, I make a pleasing progress overjoy'd At the fair prospect which before me lies, The great superior virtues of the skies, And their benevolent possessors too, With courteous aspects rising to my view. How chang'd the scene! from black infernal night, I seem t'advance towards cÅlestial light! The virtue which may first precedence claim, Benevolence; shall be the pleasing theme. To scorn revenge, and lay resentment by, Whene'er th' offending person shall apply For pardon, and his corresponding deeds, Prove from conviction the request proceeds, Makes the possessors eminently shine, Adorn'd with virtues nearest to divine; When men for pardon penitent implore, Almighty justice then demands no more. To sympathize, and gen'rous pity show, To those, whom providence hath station'd low: T'extend compassion with a tranquil eye, When vanquish'd enemies at mercy lie; To give advice, and by the same intend, To serve in any shape th' advised friend; To shun the cause of any evil thought; (A nod, a wink, a shrug, hath mischief wrought:) A just report of ev'ry one to give, And ne'er to close with butâa narrative: When base detraction seems the gen'ral aim, And death of characters becomes the theme; When defamation from each busy tongue, (With worse than venom'd Aspic's poison hung,) Like a fierce blast of scorching lightning flies, Wounding the destin'd victims by surprize; Then, the bright shield of truth to interpose 'Twixt them, and base assassinating foes, To stop th' abusive torrent, with intent To wipe aspersions from the innocent; Silent to sit at least, if shou'd not suit To contradict, and raise a warm dispute; To wish, hope, think the best of all mankind, Tho' not to their miscarriages quite blind, Their failings not t'explore with eagles eyes, And magnify their faults of smallest size; To judge with charity, and candour too, When those we know blame worthy actions do, (Remembring this, when harsh suspicions rise, No mortal man can be at all times wise: With double vigor, from a shameful fall Some men arise, at charming virtue's call:) Never to think with a malicious will, Mens words, and actions, have a meaning ill, Without sufficient cause, and shou'd there be Sufficient cause, to judge with lenity; (Search thro' the world, I dare affirm there's none Whose conscience dictates thou may'st cast the stone,) To construe not with spleen another's look; (Gestures, and aspects, oft' have been mistook;) To banish thoughts of supercilious pride, And make complacency the charming guide; Whoever shuns with care contentious strife, And makes these virtues the chief rule of life, May be esteem'd as one supremely blest, Of palliating charity possest; That robe, so pleasing in Jehovah's sight, On which he looks with such supreme delight, A multitude of sins are cover'd o'er; That heart's infirmities he'll not explore; His justice its severity abates, Where godlike charity predominates. Religion's preachers, 'tis a truth well known, Are not possess'd of this rare gift alone: Both far, and wide, its influence divine Is spread, and makes the rich possessors shine With sweet superior gen'rous excellence, The deputies of all-wise providence. The most intrepid sons of Mars may have This certain mark, of being truly brave; Ev'n whilst their martial souls are in a flame, By honour prompted, and a thirst of fame; With mild regret the vengeful sword they wield! And roll destructive thunder o'er the field! They grieve to see all humane ties made void, Forts raz'd, towns sack'd, the peasants hopes destroy'd: They conquer, wishing honourable peace; With pleasure see grim war and slaughter cease. In hottest fight, when mischief flies around, And purple torrents drench disputed ground, Benevolent commanders give the word, When mercy's crav'd, to sheath the slaught'ring sword. Arm'd in their country's cause, they rush to fight The common foe, and do the nation right: Meet in the field; promiscuously engage; 'Gainst troops imbody'd spend their utmost rage; No individual's foe; the battle o'er, The shouting ceas'd, silenc'd th' artill'ry's roar; Banish'd each savage thought, smooth'd ev'ry frown, And each ferocious sentiment cool'd down; Their ardent ireful eyes now gently roll; Godlike compassion rushes on the soul; E'en whilst the loud glad shout of triumph rings, Mild mercy, like a cherub spreads her wings O'er the dread spot, now drown'd in hostile blood, Where late the vanquish'd flying forces stood: Around the victor leaders turn their eyes, And soft emotions in their bosoms rise; To see the young, the strong, the gay, the brave, Fall'n, wounded, pain'd, and verging on the grave, To give them ease, and stop their fleeting breath, And snatch them from the jaws of greedy death, They give command, as time permits to bear The wounded off, and order decent care. This is compassion in the noblest sense; A manly laudable benevolence; To save their foes, ev'n whilst perhaps they feel The recent painful wounds of hostile steel: The truly brave, however fierce in fight, In gen'rous acts of mercy take delight. Let any search to nature's utmost bound, In ev'ry region persons may be found, Whose souls detest uncharitable guile, Who, with a sympathetic pity smile Upon the poor, the friendless, and distress'd; Who' judge with candour; most supremely bless'd With that sweet philanthropy of the mind, To sect, nor sex, nation, nor tribe confin'd; Whose objects are the race of all mankind. More than all nations of the spacious earth, Britain may boast of those of noble birth, And others, blest with smiles of prosp'rous fate, Who, voluntary strive t' alleviate The troubles and distresses of the poor, Bestowing largely of their ample store: The num'rous edifices which they raise, Speak their benevolence, and sound their praise. A house The Charter-house, founded by Mr. Thomas Sutton, 1611, in which eighty decayed men, of good characters, which ought to be gentlemen, merchants, sailors, or soldiers, are allowed lodging, diet, cloaths, &amp;c. and forty scholars are to be instructed in learning; from whence, some are sent to the universities, and others so disposed, put apprentice to trades and callings, and have necessary allowance during the time they remain at the university, or till their apprenticeship expires. This, doubtless, is the greatest charitable foundation, that ever was given by one man of his rank, especially in his life-time; for we are informed, Mr. Sutton gave the earl of Suffolk at first, for the estate, thirteen thousand pounds, besides making over estates, lands, and lordships, in divers places of considerable value, for a yearly maintenance of it for ever. For further information, vide an account of the Charter-house. expands its hospitable door, Within whose walls the meritorious poor, Receiv'd as guests, no future want may dread; Are decent cloath'd, and lodg'd, and daily fed.

King Edward the Sixth, and king Charles the Second have been likewise great, and royal benefactors to this Hospital. Sir Robert Clayton, according to his accustomed charitable generosity, was a great benefactor to this hospital; as were likewise Sir Patience Ward, Sir John Frederick, Sir John Moore, knight; Mr. John Morrice, &amp;c. and in our own times, many of our truly charitable and well disposed nobility, and gentry, have contributed largely to the support and maintenance thereof; so that some years they have had near a thousand boys and girls, and in general from about five to 700, or more. They have places in the country belonging to the foundation, to which the children are sent; where proper masters, nurses, and all necessaries are provided. In this hospital there is a grammar school, a mathematical school, a writing school, and a school for the girls; and a worthy matron always resides in the hospital, to inspect the behaviour of the nurses and servants, and to superintend the whole domestic department, which falls under the female inspection. Scholars are sent from hence to the universities, to sea, and apprenticed out to such trades and callings as shall appear suitable; and the girls are instructed in every thing necessary to make them useful members of society.

By the timely assistance which the poor have already obtained, many cancers in the breasts, and old inveterate ulcers in the Legs have been cured; and many have, from total blindness, been restored to sight; and by the timely assistance which they may in future there obtain, no doubt many will regain the use of their legs, preserve their affected sight, or recover it when lost, and be blessed with ease and sound constitutions; all which perhaps might be totally lost and destroyed by the delays which generally attend the reception of patients at hospitals. house receives the poor, The lame, the blind: compassion keeps the door: Within, they find a skilful friend, t'impart The pow'rful aids of Esculapian art.

Kind providence was pleas'd my steps to guide, Where these, munificent, oftimes reside, Dispensing bounties, and rewards around, To ev'ry rank, and sex, where merit's found. When introduc'd by long known friends to these, They soon approv'd my willingness to please; To my endeavours paid a kind regard, And gave my service all its wish'd reward. By sweet experience I have often felt The vivifying comforts they have dealt, Which never from my mind eras'd shall be: Giving both me, and mine, felicity! To show how strong their benefits have wrought, To action spurr'd, and rul'd in ev'ry thought, Have taught my soul with ardent wish to glow, I cou'd by service earn what they bestow, Wing'd with desire! and proud my friends to please, Ambitiously, I'll each occasion seize! And prove when duty calls me to the test, I wish to serve my benefactors best. But how shall I for their benevolence, Return by deeds, an ample recompence! When largest rivers, which incessant glide, And mix their currents with the briny tide, Fall vastly short, and from each copious urn, Cannot an adequate supply return; Tho' disembogueing ages, they repay Diurnal tribute to their parent sea. After a life of service shall be spent, Assiduously resolv'd to give content, I yet shall wish if possible t'impart In ampler sort, the dictates of my heart; Still striving to discharge for past and present good, The vast accumulating debt of gratitude.
