      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME IV SHAPES OF CLAY THE PASSING SHOW I I know not if it was a dream. I viewed A city where the restless multitude, Between the eastern and the western deep Had reared gigantic fabrics, strong and rude. Colossal palaces crowned every height; Towers from valleys climbed into the light; O'er dwellings at their feet, great golden domes Hung in the blue, barbarically bright. But now, new-glimmering to-east, the day Touched the black masses with a grace of gray, Dim spires of temples to the nation's God Studding high spaces of the wide survey. Well did the roofs their solemn secret keep Of life and death stayed by the truce of sleep, Yet whispered of an hour when sleepers wake, The fool to hope afresh, the wise to weep. The gardens greened upon the builded hills Above the tethered thunders of the mills With sleeping wheels unstirred to service yet By the tamed torrents and the quickened rills. A hewn acclivity, reprieved a space, Looked on the builder's blocks about his base And bared his wounded breast in sign to say: âStrike! 'tis my destiny to lodge your race. â'Twas but a breath ago the mammoth browsed Upon my slopes, and in my caves I housed Your shaggy fathers in their nakedness, While on their foemen's offal they caroused.â Ships from afar afforested the bay. Within their huge and chambered bodies lay The wealth of continents; and merrily sailed The hardy argosies to far Cathay. Beside the city of the living spreadâ Strange fellowship!âthe city of the dead; And much I wondered what its humble folk, To see how bravely they were housed, had said. Noting how firm their habitations stood, Broad-based and free of perishable woodâ How deep in granite and how high in brass The names were wrought of eminent and good, I said: âWhen gold or power is their aim, The smile of beauty or the wage of shame, Men dwell in cities; to this place they fare When they would conquer an abiding fame.â From the red East the sunâa solemn riteâ Crowned with a flame the cross upon a height Above the dead; and then with all his strength Struck the great city all aroar with light! II I know not if it was a dream. I came Unto a land where something seemed the same That I had known as 'twere but yesterday, But what it was I could not rightly name. It was a strange and melancholy land, Silent and desolate. On either hand Lay waters of a sea that seemed as dead, And dead above it seemed the hills to stand. Grayed all with age, those lonely hillsâah me, How worn and weary they appeared to be! Between their feet long dusty fissures clove The plain in aimless windings to the sea. One hill there was which, parted from the rest, Stood where the eastern water curved a-west. Silent and passionless it stood. I thought I saw a scar upon its giant breast. The sun with sullen and portentous gleam Hung like a menace on the sea's extreme; Nor the dead waters, nor the far, bleak bars Of cloud were conscious of his failing beam. It was a dismal and a dreadful sight, That desert in its cold, uncanny light; No soul but I alone to mark the fear And imminence of everlasting night! All presages and prophecies of doom Glimmered and babbled in the ghastly gloom, And in the midst of that accursÃ¨d scene A wolf sat howling on a broken tomb. ELIXIR VITÃ Of life's elixir I had writ, when sleep (Pray Heaven it spared him who the writing read!) Settled upon my senses with so deep A stupefaction that men thought me dead. The centuries stole by with noiseless tread, Like spectres in the twilight of my dream; I saw mankind in dim procession sweep Through life, oblivion at each extreme. Meanwhile my beard, like Barbarossa's growing, Loaded my lap and o'er my knees was flowing. The generations came with dance and song, And each observed me curiously there. Some asked: âWho was he?â Others in the throng Replied: âA wicked monk who slept at prayer.â Some said I was a saint, and some a bearâ These all were women. So the young and gay, Visibly wrinkling as they fared along, Doddered at last on failing limbs away; Though some, their footing in my beard entangled, Fell into its abysses and were strangled. At last a generation came that walked More slowly forward to the common tomb, Then altogether stopped. The women talked Excitedly; the men, with eyes agloom Looked darkly on them with a look of doom; And one cried out: âWe are immortal nowâ How need we these?â And a dread figure stalked, Silent, with gleaming axe and shrouded brow, And all men cried: âDecapitate the women, Or soon there'll be no room to stand or swim in!â So (in my dream) each lovely head was chopped From its fair shoulders, and but men alone Were left in all the world. Birth being stopped, Enough of room remained in every zone, And Peace ascended Woman's vacant throne. Thus, life's elixir being found (the quacks Their bread-and-butter in it gladly sopped) 'Twas made worth having by the headsman's axe. Seeing which, I gave myself a hearty shaking, And crumbled all to powder in the waking. CONVALESCENT What! âOut of danger?â Can the slighted Dame Or canting Pharisee no more defame? Will Treachery caress my hand no more, Nor Hatred lie alurk about my door?â Ingratitude, with benefits dismissed, Not understanding what 'tis all about, Will Envy henceforth not retaliate For virtues it were vain to emulate? Will Ignorance my knowledge fail to scout, Not understanding what 'tis all about, Yet feeling in its light so mean and small That all his little soul is turned to gall? What! âOut of danger?â Jealousy disarmed? Greed from exaction magically charmed? Ambition stayed from trampling whom it meets. Like horses fugitive in crowded streets? The Bigot, with his candle, book and bell, Tongue-tied, unlunged and paralyzed as well? The Critic righteously to justice haled, His own ear to the post securely nailedâ What most he dreads unable to inflict, And powerless to hawk the faults he's picked? The Liar choked upon his choicest lie, And impotent alike to vilify Or flatter for the gold of thrifty men Who hate his person but employ his penâ Who love and loathe, respectively, the dirt Belonging to his character and shirt? What! âOut of danger?ââNature's minions all, Like hounds returning to the huntsman's call, Obedient to the unwelcome note That stays them from the quarry's bursting throat?â Famine and Pestilence and Earthquake dire, Torrent and Tempest, Lightning, Frost and Fire, The soulless Tiger and the mindless Snake, The noxious Insect from the stagnant lake,â These from their immemorial prey restrained, Their fury baffled and their power chained? I'm safe? Is that what the physician said? What! âOut of danger?â Then, by Heaven, I'm dead! AT THE CLOSE OF THE CANVASS 'Twas a Venerable Person, whom I met one Sunday morning, All appareled as a prophet of a melancholy sect; And in a Jeremiad of objurgatory warning He lifted up his jodel to the following effect: âO ye sanguinary statesmen, intermit your verbal tussles! O ye editors and orators, consent to hear my lay! Rest a little while the digital and maxillary muscles And attend to what a Venerable Person has to say. âCease your writing, cease your shouting, cease your wild unearthly lying; Cease to bandy such expressions as are never, never found In the letter of a lover; cease âexposingâ and âreplyingâ Let there be abated fury and a decrement of sound. âFor to-morrow will be Monday and the fifth day of Novemberâ Only day of opportunity before the final rush. Carpe diem! go conciliate each person who's a member Of the other partyâdo so while you can without a blush. âLo! the time is close upon you when the madness of the season Having howled itself to silence like a Minnesota 'clone, Will at last be superseded by the still, small voice of reason, When the whelpage of your folly you would willingly disown. âAh, 'tis mournful to consider what remorses will be thronging, With a consciousness of having been so ghastly indiscreet, When by accident untoward two ex-gentlemen belonging To the opposite political denominations meet! âYes, 'tis melancholy, truly, to forecast the fierce, unruly Supersurging of their blushes, like the flushes upon high When Aurora Borealis lights her circumpolar palace And in customary manner sets her banner in the sky. âEach will think: âThis falsifier knows that I too am a liar. Curse him for a son of Satan, all unholily compound! Curse my leader for another! Curse that pelican, my mother! Would to God that I when little in my victual had been drowned!ââ Then that venerable warner disappeared around a corner, And the season of unreason having also taken flight, All the cheeks of men were burning like the skies to crimson turning When Aurora Borealis fires her premises by night. GEOTHEOS As sweet as the look of a lover Saluting the eyes of a maid That blossom to blue as the maid Is ablush to the glances above her, The sunshine is gilding the glade And lifting the lark out of shade. Sing therefore high praises, and therefore Sing songs that are ancient as gold, Of earth in her garments of gold; Nor ask of their meaning, nor wherefore They charm as of yore, for behold! The Earth is as fair as of old. Sing songs of the pride of the mountains, And songs of the strength of the seas, And the fountains that fall to the seas From the hands of the hills, and the fountains That shine in the temples of trees, In valleys of roses and bees. Sing songs that are dreamy and tender, Of slender Arabian palms, And shadows that circle the palms, Where caravans out of the splendor, Are kneeling in blossoms and balms, In islands of infinite calms. Barbaric, O Man, was thy runing When mountains were stained as with wine By the dawning of Time, and as wine Were the seas, yet its echoes are crooning, Achant in the gusty pine And the pulse of the poet's line. POLITICS That land full surely hastens to its end Where public sycophants in homage bend The populace to flatter, and repeat The doubled echoes of its loud conceit. Lowly their attitude but high their aim, They creep to eminence through paths of shame, Till, fixed securely in the seats of pow'r, The dupes they flattered they at last devour. THE VALLEY OF DRY BONES With crow bones all the land is white, From the gates of morn to the gates of night. Picked clean, they lie on the cumbered ground, And the politician's paunch is round; And he strokes it down and across as he sings: âI've eaten my fill of the legs and wings, The neck, the back, the pontifical nose, Breast, belly and gizzard, for everything goes. The meat that's dark (and there's none that's white) Exceeded the need of my appetite, But I've bravely stuck to the needful work That a hungry domestic hog would shirk. I've eaten the fowl that the Fates commend To reluctant lips of the People's Friend. Rank unspeakably, bitter as gall, Is the bird, but I've eaten it, feathers and all. I'm a dutiful statesman, I am, although I really don't like a diet of crow. So I've dined all alone in a furtive way, But my platter I've cleaned every blessed day. They say that I bolt; so I doâmy bird; They say that I sulk, but they've widely erred! O Lord! if my enemies only knew How I'm full to the throat with the corvic stew They'd open their ears to hear me profess The faith compelled by the corvic stress, (For, alas! necessity knows no law) In the heavenly caucusââCaw! Caw! Caw!ââ And that ornithanthropical person tried By flapping his arms on the air to ride; But I knew by the way that he clacked his bill He was just the poor, featherless biped, Dave Hill. 1896. POLYPHEMUS Twas a sick young man with a face ungay And an eye that was all alone; And he shook his head in a hopeless way As he sat on a roadside stone. âO, ailing youth, what untoward fate Has made the sun to set On your mirth and eye?â âI'm constrained to state I'm an ex-West Point cadet. â'Twas at cannon-practice I got my hurt And my present frame of mind; For the gun went off with a double spurtâ Before it, and also behind!â âHow sad, how sad, that a fine young chap, When studying how to kill, Should meet with so terrible a mishap Precluding eventual skill. âAh, woful to think that a weapon made For mowing down the foe Should commit so dreadful an escapade As to turn about to mow!â No more he heeded while I condoled: He was wandering in his mind; His lonely eye unconsidered rolled, And his views he thus defined: â'Twas O for a breach of the peaceâ'twas O For an international brawl! But a piece of the breechâah no, ah no, I didn't want that at all.â IN DEFENSE You may say if you please, Johnny Bull, that our girls Are crazy to marry your dukes and your earls; But I've heard that the maids of your own little isle Greet bachelor lords with a favoring smile. Nay, titles, 'tis said in defense of our fair, Are popular here because popular there; And for them our ladies persistently go Because 'tis exceedingly English, you know. Whatever the motive, you'll have to confess The effort's attended with easy success; Andâpardon the freedomâ'tis thought, over here, 'Tis mortification you mask with a sneer. It's all very well, sir, your scorn to parade Of the high nasal twang of the Yankee maid, But, ah, to my lord when he dares to propose No sound is so sweet as that âYesâ from the nose. Ah, well, if the dukes and the earls and that lot Can stand it (God succor them if they can not!) Your commoners ought to assent, I am sure, And what they're not called on to suffer, endure. â'Tis nothing but money?âyour nobles are boughtâ? As to that, I submit, it is commonly thought That England's a country not specially free Of CrÅsi and (if you'll allow it) CrÅsÃ¦. You've many a widow and many a girl With money to purchase a duke or an earl. 'Tis a very remarkable thing, you'll agree, When goods import buyers from over the sea. Alas for the woman of Albion's isle! She may simper; as well as she can she may smile; She may wear pantalettes and an air of reposeâ But my lord of the future will talk through his nose. INVOCATION Read at the Celebration of Independence in San Francisco, in 1888. Goddess of Liberty! O thou Whose tearless eyes behold the chain, And look unmoved upon the slain, Eternal peace upon thy brow,â Before thy shrine the races press, Thy perfect favor to imploreâ The proudest tyrant asks no more, The ironed anarchist no less. Thine altar-coals that touch the lips Of prophets kindle, too, the brand By Discord flung with wanton hand Among the houses and the ships. Upon thy tranquil front the star Burns bleak and passionless and white, Its cold inclemency of light More dreadful than the shadows are. Thy name we do not here invoke Our civic rites to sanctify: Enthroned in thy remoter sky, Thou heedest not our broken yoke. Thou carest not for such as we: Our millions die to serve the still And secret purpose of thy will. They perishâwhat is that to thee? The light that fills the patriot's tomb Is not of thee. The shining crown Compassionately offered down To those who falter in the gloom, And fall, and call upon thy name, And die desiringâ'tis the sign Of a diviner love than thine, Rewarding with a richer fame. To him alone let freemen cry Who hears alike the victor's shout, The song of faith, the moan of doubt, And bends him from his nearer sky. God of my country and my race! So greater than the gods of oldâ So fairer than the prophets told Who dimly saw and feared thy face,â Who didst but half reveal thy will And gracious ends to their desire, Behind the dawn's advancing fire Thy tender day-beam veiling still,â To whom the unceasing suns belong, And cause is one with consequence,â To whose divine, inclusive sense The moan is blended with the song,â Whose laws, imperfect and unjust, Thy just and perfect purpose serve: The needle, howsoe'er it swerve, Still warranting the sailor's trust,â God, lift thy hand and make us free To crown the work thou hast designed. O, strike away the chains that bind Our souls to one idolatry! The liberty thy love hath given We thank thee for. We thank thee for Our great dead fathers' holy war Wherein our manacles were riven. We thank thee for the stronger stroke Ourselves delivered and incurred Whenâthine incitement half unheardâ The chains we riveted we broke. We thank thee that beyond the sea Thy people, growing ever wise, Turn to the west their serious eyes And dumbly strive to be as we. As when the sun's returning flame Upon the Nileside statue shone, And struck from the enchanted stone The music of a mighty fame, Let Man salute the rising day Of Liberty, but not adore. 'Tis Opportunityâno moreâ A useful, not a sacred, ray. It bringeth good, it bringeth ill, As he possessing shall elect. He maketh it of none effect Who walketh not within thy will. Give thou more or less, as we Shall serve the right or serve the wrong. Confirm our freedom but so long As we are worthy to be free. But when (O, distant be the time!) Majorities in passion draw Insurgent swords to murder Law, And all the land is red with crime; Orânearer menace!âwhen the band Of feeble spirits cringe and plead To the gigantic strength of Greed, And fawn upon his iron hand;â Nay, when the steps to state are worn In hollows by the feet of thieves, And Mammon sits among the sheaves And chuckles while the reapers mourn: Then stay thy miracle!âreplace The broken throne, repair the chain, Restore the interrupted reign And veil again thy patient face. Lo! here upon the world's extreme We stand with lifted arms and dare By thine eternal name to swear Our country, which so fair we deemâ Upon whose hills, a bannered throng, The spirits of the sun display Their flashing lances day by day And hear the sea's pacific songâ Shall be so ruled in right and grace That men shall say: âO, drive afield The lawless eagle from the shield, And call an angel to the place!â RELIGION Hassan Bedreddin, clad in rags, ill-shod, Sought the great temple of the living God. The worshipers arose and drove him forth, And one in power beat him with a rod. âAllah,â he cried, âthou seest what I got: Thy servants bar me from the sacred spot.â âBe comforted,â the Holy One replied; âIt is the only place where I am not.â TWO SOCIALISTS Brand Whitlock sped from Hell through space, To be remanded neverâ For having such a saintly face, Set free forever, With due apology. He came To a world so base and bestial No tongue infernal spake its nameâ No tongue celestial. So foul it was that even He Had cast it off Who made it: Adrift in space, as on a sea, No mooring stayed it. That orb unclean, denied the aid Of gravitation's tether, For centuries had blindly strayedâ Lost altogether! The sun disdainfully declined To light the villain planet, And the whole universe combined To curse and ban it. The Thief Impenitent, his grim Recusance unabated, Was its sole occupant: for him It was created. For when the wretch was newly dead 'Twas thought Hell had not ample Restraints to check the local spread Of his example, Nor apparatus that insured A proper pang; though lately The woes that he at first endured Had softened greatly. But still one fierce, vain longing he Suffered, nor could o'ercome itâ The wish to sit in reverie On Calvary's summit. Beneath that orb's unjoyous sky Brand Whitlock found the sinner. Affinity!âthe outer eye Lit by the inner. Said Whitlock: âHere my stay is brief; Take, brother, ere we sever, Thy pardon. Be a better thief Henceforth forever. âGod gives me power to condone All scalawags' offending, For the sweet faith that I have shown In their amending.â When so he'd said with solemn grace, As was that good soul's habit, The Thief directly into space Sprang like a rabbit! (He might have left at any time Had freedom been his passion, For God had long forgot his crime. Crime was the fashion.) The Saint, resuming soon his flight, Met him through chaos floating. Three stolen post-holes that poor wight Was gaily toting. A MORNING FANCY I drifted (or I seemed to) in a boat Upon the surface of a shoreless sea Whereon no ship nor anything did float, Save only the frail bark supporting me; And thatâit was so shadowyâseemed to be Almost from out the subtle azure wrought Of the great ocean underneath its keel; And all that blue profound appeared as naught But thicker sky, translucent to reveal, Miles down, whatever through its spaces glided, Or at the bottom traveled or abided. Great cities there I saw; of rich and poor The palace and the hovel; mountains, vales, Forest and field; the desert and the moor; Tombs of the good and wise who'd lived in jails; Seas of a denser fluid, white with sails Pushed at by currents moving here and there And sensible to sight above the flat Of that opaquer deep. Ah, strange and fair The nether world that I was gazing at With beating heart from that exalted level, And, lest I founder, trembling like the devil! The cities all were populous: men swarmed In public placesâchattered, laughed and wept; And savages their shining bodies warmed At fires in primal woods. The wild beast leapt Upon its prey and slew it as it slept. Armies went forth to battle on the plain So far, far down in that unfathomed deep The living seemed as silent as the slain, Nor even the widows could be heard to weep. One might have thought their shaking was but laughter; And, truly, most were married shortly after. Above the wreckage of that silent fray Strange fishes swam in circles, round and roundâ Black, double-finned; and once a little way A bubble rose and burst without a sound And a man tumbled out upon the ground. Lord! 'twas an eerie thing to drift apace On that pellucid sea, beneath black skies And o'er the heads of an undrowning race! And when I woke I saidâto her surprise Who came with chocolate, for me to drink it: âThe atmosphere is deeper than you think it.â VISIONS OF SIN Kraslajorsk, Siberia.âMy eyes are better, and I shall travel slowly toward home.â Danenhower. From the regions of the Night, Coming with recovered sightâ From the spell of darkness free, What will Danenhower see? He will see when he arrives Doctors taking human lives. He will see a learned judge Whose decision will not budge Till both litigants are fleeced And his palm is duly greased. Lawyers he will see who fight Day by day and night by night; Never both upon a side, Though their fees they still divide. Preachers he will see who teach That it is divine to preachâ That they fan a sacred fire And are worthy of their hire. He will see a trusted wife, Pride of some good husband's life, Enter at a certain door Andâbut he will see no more. He will see Good Templars reelâ See a prosecutor steal, And a father beat his child. He'll perhaps see Oscar Wilde. From the regions of the Night Coming with recovered sightâ From the bliss of blindness free, That's what Danenhower'll see. 1882. GENIUS What is the thing called Genius? One has said 'Tis general ability directed Into a special channel. One, instead, Proffers a definition much respected By toiling dullards: genius, he explains, Is infinite capacity for taking pains. Max Nordau, seeing he has not the thing, Has solemnly decided, with Lombroso, That genius is degeneracy. Ring The curtain downâthe show is only so-so; I'd rather see a dog-fight than sit out This inconclusive definition-bout. What, then, is genius? Faith, I'm only sure That I am deep in doubt about the matter; But this I think: of two in literature He is the greater genius who's the fatter. 'Twas in an age less prosperous that those Were kings of thought who starved by verse and prose. Lo! the lean rhapsodist whose soul surveys, Ecstatic, his unprofitable vision, Interprets it in cleanly speech; arrays His jeweled words with scholarly precision! Faith, he's a dunce or he would never lack The means to wedge his belly from his back. 'Twere passing easy to allay his pang Had he the geniusâthat's to say, the insight Commercial. If he would but sing in slang He'd earn the wherewithal to make his skin tight. Genius (let's now define the word afresh) Is the capacity to take on flesh. Spirit of Letters, hail! Thy reign is Now; Thy ministers are gentlemen that waddleâ Children of light and leading who avow They swap, for tallow, speech that's not a model,â For laminated kidney-suet trade Unsavory words. You must be stout, George Ade. THE TOWN OF DÃ Swains and maidens, young and old, You to me this tale have told. Where the squalid town of DÃ¦ Irks the comfortable sea, Spreading webs to gather fish, As for wealth we set a wish, Dwelt a king by right divine, Sprung from Adam's royal line. Town of DÃ¦ by the sea, Divers kinds of kings there be. Name nor fame had Picklepip: Ne'er a soldier nor a ship Bore his banners in the sun; Naught knew he of kingly sport, And he held his royal court Under an inverted tun. Love and roses, ages through, Bloom where cot and trellis stand; Never yet these blossoms grewâ Never yet was room for twoâ In a cask upon the strand. So it happened, as it ought, That his simple schemes he wrought Through the lagging summer's day In a solitary way. So it happened, as was best, That he took his nightly rest With no dreadful weight of woe, This way eyed and that way tressed, Featured thus, and thus, and so, Lying lead-like on a breast By cares of state enough oppressed. Yet in dreams his fancy rude Claimed a lordly latitude. Town of DÃ¦ by the sea, Dreamers mate above their state And waken back to their degree. Once to cask himself away He prepared at close of day. As he tugged with swelling throat At a most unkingly coatâ Not to get it off but on, For the serving sun was goneâ Passed a silk-appareled sprite Toward her castle on the height, Seized and set the garment right. Turned the startled Picklepip Splendid crimson cheek and lip! Turned again to sneak away, But she bade the villain stay, Bade him thank her, which he did With a speech that slipped and slid, Sprawled and stumbled in its gait As a dancer tries to skate. Town of DÃ¦ by the sea, In the face of silk and lace Rags too bold should never be. Lady Minnow cocked her head: âMister Picklepip,â she said, âDo you ever think to wed?â Town of DÃ¦ by the sea, No fair lady ever made a Wicked speech like that to me! Wretched little Picklepip Said he hadn't any ship, Any flocks at his command, Nor to feed them any land; Said he never in his life Owned a mine to keep a wife. But the guilty stammer so That his meaning wouldn't flow; So he thought his aim to reach By some figurative speech: Said his Fate had been unkind Had pursued him from behind (How the mischief could it else?) Came upon him unaware, Caught him all too roughlyâthere Gushed the little lady's glee Like a gush of golden bells: âPicklepip, why, that is me!â Town of DÃ¦ by the sea, Grammar's for great scholarsâshe Loved the summer and the lea. Stupid little Picklepip Allowed the subtle hint to slipâ Maundered on about the ship That he did not chance to own; Told this grievance o'er and o'er, Knowing that she knew before; Told her how he dwelt alone. Lady Minnow, for reply, Cut him off with âSo do I.â But she reddened at the fib; Servitors had she, ad lib. Town of DÃ¦ by the sea, In her youth who speaks no truth Ne'er shall young and honest be. Witless little Picklepip Manned again his mental ship And veered her with a sudden shift: Painted to the lady's thought How he wrestled and he wrought Stoutly with the swimming drift By the kindly river brought From the mountain to the sea, Fuel for the town of DÃ¦. Tedious tale for lady's ear: From her castle on the height, She had watched her water-knight Through the seasons of a year Challenge more than met his view And conquer better than he knew. Now she shook her pretty pate And stamped her footâ'twas growing late: âMister Picklepip, when I Drifting seaward pass you by; When the waves my forehead kiss And my tresses float aboveâ Dead and drowned for lack of loveâ You'll be sorry, sir, for this!â And the silly creature criedâ Feared, perchance, the rising tide. Town of DÃ¦ by the sea, Madam Adam, when she had 'em. May have been as bad as she. Fiat lux! Love's lumination Fell in floods of revelation! Blinded brain by world aglare, Sense of pulses in the air, Sense of swooning and the beating Of a voice somewhere repeating Something indistinctly heard! And the soul of Picklepip Sprang upon his trembling lip, But he spake no further word Of the wealth he did not own; In that moment had outgrown Ship and mine and flock and landâ Even his cask upon the strand. Dropped a stricken star to earth, Type of wealth and worldly worth. Clomb the moon into the sky, Type of love's immensity! Shaking silver seemed the sea, Throne of God the town of DÃ¦! Town of DÃ¦ by the sea, From above there cometh love, Blessing all good souls that be. AN ANARCHIST False to his art and to the high command God laid upon him, Demagogo's hand Beats all in vain the harp he thrilled before: It yields a jingle and it yields no more. No more the strings beneath his finger-tips Sing harmonies divine. No more his lips, Touched with a living coal from sacred fires, Lead the sweet chorus of the golden wires. The voice is raucous and the phrases squeak; They labor, they complain, they sweat, they reek! The more the wayward, disobedient song Errs from the right to advocate the wrong, More diligently still the singer strums, To drown the horrid sound, with all his thumbs. Gods, what a spectacle! The angels lean Out of high Heaven to view the sorry scene, And Israfel, âwhose heart-strings are a lute,â Though now compassion makes their music mute, Among the weeping company appears, Pearls in his eyes and cotton in his ears. AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE Once I âdipt into the future far as human eye could see,â And sawâit was not Sandow, nor John Sullivan, but sheâ Emancipated Woman, who was weeping as she ran Here and there for the discovery of Expurgated Man. But the sun of Evolution ever rose and ever set, And that tardiest of mortals hadn't evoluted yet. Hence the tears that she cascaded, hence the sighs that tore apart All the tendinous connections of her indurated heart. Cried Emancipated Woman, as she wearied of the search: âIn Advancing I have left myself distinctly in the lurch! Seeking still a worthy partner, from the land of brutes and dudes I have penetrated rashly into manless solitudes. Now without a mate of any kind where am I?âthat's to say, Where shall I be to-morrow?âwhere exert my rightful sway And the purifying strength of my emancipated mind? Can solitude be lifted up, vacuity refined? Calling, calling from the shadows in the rear of my Advanceâ From the region of Unprogress in the dark domain of Chanceâ Long I heard the Unevolvable beseeching my return To share the degradation he's reluctant to unlearn. But I've held my way regardless, evoluting year by year Till I'm what you now behold meâor would if you were hereâ A condensed Emancipation and a Purifier proud, An Independent Entity appropriately loud! Independent? Yes, in spirit, but (O woful, woful state!) Doomed to premature extinction by privation of a mateâ To extinction or reversion, for Unexpurgated Man Still awaits me in the backward if I sicken of the van. O the horrible dilemma!âto be odiously linked With an Undeveloped Species, or become a Type Extinct!â As Emancipated Woman wailed her sorrow to the air, Stalking out of desolation came a being strange and rareâ Plato's Man!âa biped, featherless from mandible to rump, Its wings two quilless flippers and its tail a plumeless stump. First it scratched and then it clucked, as if in hospitable terms It invited her to banquet on imaginary worms. Then it strutted up before her with a lifting of the head, And in accents of affection and of sympathy it said: âMy estate is some'at 'umble, but I'm qualified to draw Near the hymeneal altar and whack up my heart and claw To Emancipated Anything as walks upon the earth; And them things is at your service for whatever they are worth. I'm sure to be congenial, marm, nor e'er deserve a scowlâ I'm Emancipated Rooster, I am Expurgated Fowl!â From the future and its wonders I withdrew my gaze, and then Wrote this wild, unfestive lay of Evolutionated Hen. ARMA VIRUMQUE âOurs is a Christian armyâ; so he said A regiment of bangomen who led. âAnd ours a Christian navy,â added he Who sailed a thunder-junk upon the sea. Better they know than men unwarlike do What is an army, and a navy too. Pray God there may be sent them by-and-by The knowledge what a Christian is, and why. For somewhat lamely the conception runs Of a brass-buttoned Jesus firing guns. ON A PROPOSED CREMATORY When a fair bridge is builded o'er the gulf Between two cities, some ambitious fool, Hot for distinction, pleads for earliest leave To push his clumsy feet upon the span, That men in after years may single him, Saying: âBehold the fool who first went o'er!â So be it when, as now the promise is, Next summer sees the edifice complete Which some do name a crematorium, Within the vantage of whose greater maw's Quicker digestion we shall cheat the worm And circumvent the handed mole who loves, With tunnel, adit, drift and roomy stope, To mine our mortal parts in all their dips And spurs and angles. Let the fool stand forth To link his name with this fair enterprise, As first decarcassed by the flame. And if With rival greedings for the fiery fame They push in clamoring multitudes, or if With unaccustomed modesty they all Hold off, being something loth to qualify, Let me select the fittest for the rite. By Heaven! I'll make so warrantable, wise And excellent censure of their true deserts, And such a searching canvass of their claims, That none shall bait the allot. I'll spread my choice Upon the main and general of those Who, moved of holy impulse, pulpit-born, Protested 'twere a sacrilege to burn God's gracious images, designed to rotâ Who bellowed for the right of way for each Distempered carrion through the water pipes. With such a sturdy, boisterous exclaim They did discharge themselves from their own throats Against the splintered gates of audience 'Twere wholesomer to take them in at mouth Than ear. These shall burn first: their ignoble And seasoned substancesâtrunks, legs and arms, Blent indistinguishable in a mass, Like winter-woven serpents in a pit, None vantaged with unfair precedency And all impartially aliveâshall serve As fueling to fervor the retort For after cineration of true men. A DEMAND You promised to paint me a picture, Dear Mat, And I was to pay you in rhyme. Although I am loth to inflict your Most easy of consciences, I'm Of opinion that fibbing is awful, And breaking a contract unlawful, Indictable, too, as a crime, A slight and all that. If, Lady Unbountiful, any Of that By mortals called pity has part In your obdurate soulâif a penny You care for the health of my heart, By performing your undertaking You'll succor that organ from breakingâ And spare it for some new smart, As puss does a rat. Do you think it is very becoming, Dear Mat, To deny me my rights evermore? Andâbless you! if I begin summing Your sins they will make a long score! You never were generous, madam: If you had been Eve and I Adam You'd have given me naught but the core, And little of that. Had I been content with a Titian, A cat By Landseer, a meadow by Claude, No doubt I'd have had your permission To take itâby purchase abroad. But why should I sail o'er the ocean For Landseers and Claudes? I've a notion All's bad that the critics belaud. I wanted a Mat. Presumption's a sin, and I suffer For that: But still you did say that sometime, If I'd pay you enough (here's enougherâ That's more than enough) of rhyme You'd paint me a picture. I pay you Hereby in advance; and I pray you Condone, while you can, your crime, And send me a Mat. But if you don't do so I warn you, Dear Mat, I'll raise such a clamor and cry On Parnassus the Muses will scorn you As mocker of poets and fly With bitter complaints to Apollo: âHer spirit is proud, her heart hollow, Her beautyââthey'll hardly deny, On second thought, that! THE WEATHER-WIGHT The way was long, the hill was steep, My footing scarcely I could keep. The night enshrouded me in gloom, I heard the ocean's distant boomâ The trampling of the surges vast Was borne upon the rising blast. âGod help the mariner,â I cried, âWhose ship to-morrow braves the tide!â Then from the impenetrable dark A solemn voice made this remark: âFor this localityâwarm, bright; Barometer unchanged; breeze light.â âUnseen consoler-man,â I cried, âWhoe'er you are, where'er abide, âThanksâbut my care is somewhat less For Jack's, than for my own, distress. âCould I but find a friendly roof, Small odds what weather were aloof. âFor he whose comfort is secure Another's pain can well endure.â âThe latch-string's out,â the voice replied, âAnd so's the doorâjes' step inside.â Then through the darkness I discerned A hovel into which I turned. Groping about beneath its thatch, I struck my head and then a match. A candle by that gleam betrayed Soon lent paraffinaceous aid. A pallid, bald and thin old man I saw, who this complaint began: âThrough summer suns and winter snows I sets observin' of my toes. âI rambles with increasin' pain The path of duty, but in vain. âRewards and honors pass me byâ No Congress hears this raven cry!â Filled with astonishment, I spoke: âThou ancient raven, why this croak? âWith observation of your toes What Congress has to do, God knows! âAnd swallow me if e'er I knew That one could sit and ramble too!â To answer me that ancient swain Took up his parable again: âThrough winter snows and summer suns A Weather Bureau here I runs. âI calls the turn, and can declare Jes' when she'll storm and when she'll fair. âThree times a day I sings out clear The probs to all which wants to hear. âSome weather stations, run with light Frivolity, is seldom right. âA scientist from times remote, In Scienceville my birth is wrote. âAnd when I h'ist the ârainyâ sign Jes' take your clo'es in off the line.â âNot mine, O marvelous old man, The methods of your art to scan, âYet here no instruments there beâ Nor 'ometer nor 'scope I see. âDid you (if questions you permit) At the asylum leave your kit?â That strange old man with motion rude Rose to surprising altitude. âTools (and sarcazzems too) I scornsâ I tells the weather by my corns. âNo doors and windows here you seeâ The wind and m'isture enters free. âNo fires nor lights, no wool nor fur Here falsifies the tempercher. âMy corns unleathered I expose To feel the rain's foretellin' throes. âNo stockin' from their ears keeps out The comin' tempest's warnin' shout. âSech delicacy some has got They know next summer's to be hot. âThis here one says (for that he's best): âStorm center passin' to the west.â âThis feller's vitals is transfixed With frost for Janawary sixt'. âOne chap jes' now is occypied In fig'rin on next Fridy's tide. âI've shaved this cuss so thin and true He'll spot a fog in South Peru. âSech are my tools, which ne'er a swell Observatory can excel. âBy long a-studyin' their throbs I catches onto all the probs.â Much more, no doubt, he would have said, But suddenly he turned and fled; For in mine eye's indignant green Lay storms that he had not foreseen, Concerning which, as Fear appeals To Speed, his toes had told his heels. T. A. H. Yes, he was that, or that, as you preferâ Did so and so, though, faith, it wasn't all; Lived like a fool, or a philosopher, And had whatever's needful to a fall. As rough inflections on a planet merge In the true bend of the gigantic sphere, Nor mar the perfect circle of its verge, So in the survey of his worth the small Asperities of spirit disappear, Lost in the grander curves of character. He lately was hit hard: none knew but I The strength and terror of that ghastly strokeâ Not even herself. He uttered not a cry, But set his teeth and made a revelry; Drank like a devilâstraining sometimes red The goblet's edge; diced with his conscience; spread, Like Sisyphus, a feast for Death and spoke His welcome in a tongue so long forgot That even his ancient guest remembered not What race had cursed him in it. Thus my friend, Still conjugating with each failing sense The verb âto dieâ in every mood and tense, Pursued his awful humor to the end. When like a stormy dawn the crimson broke From his white lips he smiled and mutely bled, And, having meanly lived, is grandly dead. MY MONUMENT It is pleasant to think, as I'm watching my ink A-drying along my paper, That a monument fine will surely be mine When death has extinguished my taper. From each pitiless scribe of the critic tribe Purged clean of all sentiments narrow, A pebble will mark his respect for the stark Stiff body that's under the barrow. Thus stone upon stone by reviewers thrown, Will make my celebrity deathless. O I wish I could think, as I gaze at my ink, They'd wait till my carcass is breathless. MAD O ye who push and fight To hear a wanton singâ Who utter the delight That has the bogus ring,â O men mature in years, In understanding young, The membranes of whose ears She tickles with her tongue,â O wives and daughters sweet, Who call it love of art To kiss a woman's feet That crush a woman's heart,â O prudent dams and sires, Your docile young who bring To see how man admires A sinner if she singâ O husbands who impart To each assenting spouse The lesson that shall start The buds upon your brows,â All whose applauding hands Assist to rear the flame That throws o'er all the lands The shadow of its shame,â Go drag her car!âthe mud Through which its axle rolls Is partly human blood And partly human souls. Mad, mad!âyour senses whirl Like devils dancing free Because a strolling girl Can hold the note high C. For this the avenging rod Of Heaven ye dare defy, And tear the law that God Thundered from Sinai! FOR COERCION OF COLOMBIA âThe ships steam south From the harbor mouth In warlike, grim array! They load the seas, And on every breeze I hear the brass bands play As the squadrons steer away. âFrom each foreign shore They are coming o'er The oceans big and small, With cheering crews And churning screws, And guns and shot and all, And Admirals that appal! âIn tropical seas They are thick as bees. Oh, ne'er on the Trojan strand Was gathered a fleet So hard to beat As sails to that southern land. 'Tis terribly, terribly grand! âO sailorman stout, What's it all about? If you happen to know tell me. That the foe has no chance His troops to advance To the field we all agree, And the devil a ship has he.â He shifted his quid, The sailorman did, To the starboard side of his face. His trousers he hitched As he rolled and pitched, Maintaining his dubious place With a certain maritime grace. He looked at the sky With a studious eye, And this singular yarn he spun: âWhen the wind's sou'west Every man's possessed Of a devil!âno son-of-a-gun Can tell what's fit to be done.â Perhaps it was naught But a sailorman's thought, But I said to myself: âI'm blest If I can't mark down A man of renown Who is living in mental unrest Where the wind is forever sou'west.â A TEAGOING ADMIRAL Once the Queen of Nether China (So benign a Messalina!) Said: âI'll make a Naval Hero Without fearâO brave as Nero! He shall dominate the ocean By promotion, that's my notion. All my other sons of thunder Then shall plunder vainly under This Incomparable Person, Interspersin' lively cursin' With their futile strife to shiver Every river-pirate's liver, And to ascertain the measure Of his treasure at their leisure. For I'll so arrange the looting And the shooting and the hooting, And the making frightful faces (These grimaces are the bases Of our tactics) that they never, Howsoever brave and clever, Shall have any kind of inning In the skinning now beginning. And I'll see that in the story Of the gory game of glory The historian shall slight 'em Or indict 'emâmaybe bite 'em. But the Hero of my making, Whom I'm aching to be waking Into visible existence, He shall distance these Philistines. Fame's loud trumpetâhe shall hear it. Blown with spirit in his ear, it Shall extol his birth and breeding, His exceeding knack at leading In a sanguinary sea fight, Or a tea fight, or a flea fight, Till he burst with admiration Of his station in the nation! Then while all the people mock him, I'll unfrock him! That will shock him.â Thus the Queen of Nether China, The Regina Mun-Kee-Shina, Made to Naval Evolution A Confucian contribution. 1898. THE WOOER In Ballybazoo the young men woo With the irresistible hob-nail shoe; But in Ghargharoo lived a maiden who Was pleased to remark that it wouldn't do. From Ghargharoo to Ballybazoo This sternly dissenting maiden (who, Etc.) went to resideâa lass With a cheek of steel and a brow of brass. Then all the young men of Ballybazoo Took turns in calling early to woo (With the irresistible hob-nail shoe) The beautiful maiden from Ghargharoo. As each fond lover with ardor threw His heel in her upturned face there flew A rain of sparks that consumed his eyes, Affecting his mind with a great surprise. When all the young men had renounced their sight, The metal-faced maiden she sat upright, Remarking: âThere's nothing here to doâ A dull, dull village is Ballybazoo.â From Ballybazoo to Ghargharoo The cheek-whole maiden her armament drew, And her playmate lovers raised a hurroo That saddened the sightless in Ballybazoo. A stranger there was who cherished a heel Of double-case-hardened, cold-rolled chrome steel! And taking thought he decided to woo, As 'twas his undoubted right to do. To display his charms he removed his shoe, And boarding her visage, began to woo. And there in the gloaming, and not in vain, The old, old story was told again. It was long ago in the sainted past, But traits long latent crop out at last; And I know a live newspaper fellow who Has ancestors buried in Ghargharoo. SILHOUETTES OF ORIENTALS The Sultan is a Muscleman; He's full of vim and whack, And if you want a tussle man His back. Because he's a Mahometan, They think him mighty slow. He's quicker than a cometâan Auto! He doesn't often waste a fit, But throws it where 'twill tell. Blood? Yes, he likes the taste of it Right well. That angel, the Bulgarian, Is just a bird of pray. His soul's as white as Parian, They say. His halo fits him pleasantly And he has two great wings. He tunes his harp, and presently He sings: âMy shoulder inoffensively Bears this dear little chip. Pass on, wayfarer, pensivelyâ Don't flip.â The thoughtful Moslem pins the chip Fast with a dagger. Oh, That angel-person's sins of lip Are low! The Armenian is a sassy cur, Cantankerous to boot, Nor draws the line at massacre And loot. But when the Kurd in revelry Slays, burns, imprisons, fines, That bad gent to the devil he Consigns. My muse cannot exemplify The Macedonianâshe Refuses to attempt to fly So free. Old Philip, King of Macedon, Is many ages dead; We have this little gassy don Instead. Is he a Unitarian, A Moslem, Buddhist, Jewâ Or just a gowned barbarian With trousers on his Mary Ann? Don't knowâdo you? LAND OF THE PILGRIMS' PRIDE I dreamed, and in my dream came one who said: âBecause thou art all sullen; and because Thou sayest thou hast not for thy country, love; Because thou dost begrudge the foolish blood That in the far heroic days thou didst (Or sayst thou didst) pour from thy riven vein In testimony to thy patriot zeal; Because thou seekest ever to promote Distrust of the benign and wholesome rule Of the MajorityâGod's Ministers; Because thou hearest in the People's voice Naught but the mandate of an idiot will Clamoring in the wilderness, but what Or why it knoweth not; because all this And much beside is true, I comeââ âForbear,â I cried, âto name thine errandâall Too well I know it for the sword, the scales, The shrouded eyes (albeit methinks I catch A twinkle now and then beneath the band) Speak to my conscience of a traitor's doom! Strike, then, but hear. To westward, roaring up From far beyond the earth's vast curvature, Come sounds of discord horribleâthe jar And thunder of exploding bombs; The crackle of the flames that eat away The means of life of those who kindle them; The shouts and curses of the robber mob, Drunk with a sense of numbersâlike the wolves, Numerically braveâon ravin bent And murder! Hear the moans of honest men, With shameful by-name vilified, denied The right to earn their bread, and with a blind, Mad cruelty the devil would weep to see, Beaten and tortured, even by the hands Of the barbarian's female and his whelps! Meanwhile the coward rulers of the land Prate of âthe People's wrongs.â The coward press (Thrifty withal to purse a double gain By two-faced flattery) prates like a fool Of the conservative and saving strength Of Anglo-Saxon institutions, or With magic words, as âfreedom,â and the like, Would conjure order from inharmony. The land is foul with crime, and none declares Our shame and downfall. Even the women rise And seeing the rack and ruin men have wrought, Strip their weak bodies with a silly zeal Something to save from the chaotic wreck; And in the reek and sweat of their absurd And awkward efforts, lose even what remainedâ Their own morality and men's respect. Therefore I say to youââ âNay say no more,â Cried she who came into my dream, âfor thou Dost wander. What, pray, has all this to do With what thou'rt charged with?âthat thou dost not loveâ Such as it isâthy country?â Faith, I would, But 'tis infested by my countrymen!â What she replied I know not, for a bomb, Spitting and sputtering on my chamber floor, Awoke me and I fled into the night. A SINGLE TERMER When Senator Foraker came to die His features lit up with a glow, And he said: âI am going to dwell on high And the Democrats down below. âI have kept the faith, I have fought the fight, To the Trusts forever true. With Elkins to lead, I have followed the lightâ Saint Peter, it's up to you.â Said Peter: âWe strive to please in vain; Many a soul coming here Escapes to earth to be born again And resume the old career.â Here he opened the gate. âAlthough, no doubt, This fellow's a son of sin, The devil himself can't keep him out, But I'll lock the fine gentleman in.â A PLAGUE OF ASSES Alas, we've fallen upon an evil time, Our journals are all in a rash of rhyme. Slang, âdialect,â the humor of the slum, Done into stanzas by the rule of thumb, The peasant word, the coarse, colloquial phrase, Fitting the pauper thought that it conveys, March to the meter-master's âhep, hep, hep,â With every second soldier out of step. What sins of ours deserve this heavy curse? Who taught our clowns 'tis easy to write verse If neither poetry nor wit be deemed A needful ornament, nor sense esteemed A twin of sound? O rustics of the quill, Ill-made by Nature, making others ill, (Landlubbers on the sea of song a-sail Uttering your fancies o'er the leeward rail) Forgive the wicked wish I cannot choose But entertainâthat, luckless, you may lose Each one a thumb of the tormenting ten Whereon you reckon syllables. Ah, then, Restored to what it was before you learned That grinning through horse-collars ever earned Plaudits of rustics and enough of dollars To pay the weekly rental of the collars, With something over for the stomach's throes, Your ailing verse will turn to ailing prose. Then joyous angels will look down and say: âBehold! the ninety-nine that went astray Return to where, from fields of noxious grass, Sweet thistles beckon each repenting ass.â IN CUBA Our Administration Had made a new nationâ As new as a nation could be. A raven was flapping Above it and snapping His beak with a manifest glee. âO raven, what is it you see That causes the manifest glee? âYou can't be designing A programme of dining On anything living and free. You're famous for dinners That plain-speaking sinners Condemn with the Terrible D! (The word is abhorrent to me That begins with the Terrible D.) âCome down from your airy Position and tarry Awhile on this cocoanut tree, And tell me what joying You find in annoying A nation so young and so freeâ Not dead in the slightest degree, But lively and healthy as we.â The raven, complying, Said, solemnly eying My edible parts from the tree: âIt isn't to nations I look for my rations To any extent or degree. They don't fill the hollow in me To an appreciable degree. âYet the seasons ensuing Will see something doing To heighten my manifest glee. 'Tis soldiers that mostly Appeal to my ghostly Unusual appetite, see? They're easy digesting to me With my singular appetite, see?â Then I hammered my forehead To think of that horrid Old bird with his appetite free, A-sitting there, lacking Compassion and cracking His beak, on a cocoanut tree, As if merely saying to me: âOh, what a fine cocoanut tree.â I said somewhat later: âOur Administrator Of Freedom's estate, O see! His Administration Presents us a ânationâ That's spelled with the Terrible D! And ânationâ is hateful to me When led by the Terrible D.â FOR A CERTAIN CRITIC Let lowly theme engage my humble penâ Stupidities of critics, not of men. Be it mine once more the maunderings to trace Of the expounders' self-directed raceâ Their wire-drawn fancies, finically fine, Of diligent vacuity the sign. Let them in jargon of their trade rehearse The moral meaning of the random verse That runs spontaneous from the poet's pen To be half-blotted by ambitious men Who hope with his their meaner names to link By writing o'er it in another ink The thoughts unreal which they think they think, Until the mental eye in vain inspects The hateful palimpsest to find the text. The lark, ascending heavenward, loud and long Sings to the dawning day his wanton song. The moaning dove, attentive to the sound, Its hidden meaning hastens to expound: Explains its principles, designâin brief, Pronounces it a parable of grief! The bee, just pausing ere he daubs his thigh With pollen from a hollyhock near by, Declares he never heard in terms so just The labor problem thoughtfully discussed! The browsing ass looks up and clears his whistle To say: âA monologue upon the thistle!â Meanwhile the lark, descending, folds his wing And innocently asks: âWhat!âdid I sing?â O literary parasites! who thrive Upon the fame of better men, derive Your sustenance by suction, like a leech, And, for you preach of them, think masters preach,â Who find it half is profit, half delight, To write about what you could never write,â Consider, pray, how sharp had been the throes Of famine and discomfiture in those You write of if they had been critics, too, And doomed to write of nothing but of you! Lo! where the gaping crowd throngs yonder tent, To see the lion resolutely bent! The prosing showman who the beast displays Grows rich and richer daily in its praise. But how if, to attract the curious yeoman, The lion owned the show and showed the showman? ARTHUR McEWEN Posterity with all its eyes Will come and view him where he lies. Then, turning from the scene away With a concerted shrug, will say: âH'm, ScarbÃ¦us Sisyphusâ What interest has that to us? We can't admire at all, at all, A tumble-bug without its ball.â And then a sage will rise and say: âGood friends, you errâturn back, I pray: This freak that you unwisely shun Is bug and ball rolled into one.â CHARLES AND PETER Ere Gabriel's note to silence died All graves of men were gaping wide. Then Charles A. Dana, of The Sun Rose slowly from the deepest one. âThe dead in Christ rise first, 'tis writ,â Quoth heââick, bick, ban, doe,âI'm It!â (His headstone, footstone, counted slow, Were âickâ and âbick,â he âbanâ and âdoeâ: Of beating Nick the subtle art Was part of his immortal part.) Then straight to Heaven he took his flight, Arriving at the Gates of Light. There Warden Peter, in the throes Of sleep, lay roaring in the nose. âGet up, you sluggard!â Dana criedâ âI've an engagement there inside.â The Saint arose and scratched his head. âI recollect your face,â he said, â(And, pardon me, 'tis rather hard) Butââ Dana handed him a card. âAh, yes, I now rememberâbless My soul, how dull I am!âyes, yes, âWalk in. But I must tell you this: We've nothing better here than bliss. âWe've rest and comfort, though, and peace.â âH'mâpuddles,â Dana said, âfor geese. âHave you in Heaven no Hell?â âWhy no,â Said Peter, ânor, in truth, below. â'Tis not included in our schemeâ 'Tis but a preacher's idle dream.â The great man slowly moved away. âI'll call,â he said, âanother day. âOn earth I played it, o'er and o'er, And Heaven without it were a bore.â âO, stuff!âcome in. You'll make,â said Pete, âA Hell where'er you set your feet.â CONTEMPLATION I muse upon the distant town In many a dreamy mood. Above my head the sunbeams crown The graveyard's giant rood. The lupin blooms among the tombs, The quail recalls her brood. Ah, good it is to sit and trace The shadow of the cross; It moves so still from place to place O'er marble, bronze and moss; With graves to mark upon its arc Our time's eternal loss. And sweet it is to watch the bee That revels in the roses, And sense the fragrance floating free On every breeze that dozes Upon the mound, where, safe and sound, Mine enemy reposes. THE GOLDEN AGE Long ago the world was finerâ Why it failed I do not know: All the virtues were diviner; Robber, miser, and maligner Had not been created. No, Truth and honor flourished, though, Long ago. Sages in procession stalking Moved majestic to and fro, And each lowly mortal walking In their shadow stilled his talking, Heeding the sonorous flow Of their wisdom, loud or low, Long ago. Angel Woman, younger, fairer Far than she that now we know, Gave men meeting with a rarer Grace. No graybeard cried, âBeware her Tongue and temper!â She was slow To wrath. I tell you that was so, Long ago. Ah, the miracle of morning, Setting all the world aglow Like a smile of light adorning God's own face, held no forewarning Of the tempest that would blowâ Sign and prophecy of woe, Long ago. Hope from every hilltop beckoned To the happy throngs below; And they confidently reckoned On a hero every second. Best of all that goodly show, I was but a laddieâO, So long ago! A PROPHET OF PEACE âThe world is young, perverse, and bad, The virtues all are wanting; The gods are dead and men are mad And wickedness is haunting The human heart, an honored guest, As robbers of the night infest A wayside inn in Camilhad. âHate walks the earth all unafraid, And neighbor murders neighbor; Greed draws on Greed the battle-blade, And Labor strangles Labor. The widow and the orphan cry For bread while benefactors ply Unlashed by law, their dreadful trade. âKing, president, and patriot Serve their accurst ambition; The soldier and the sans-culottes, The priest and politician, Are blowing with impested breath The coals of war that sparkle death. Peace, righteousness, and love are not. âBut I shall live to see the day Whose golden dawn is breaking! The reign of war no more shall lay Our dust, nor hearts be aching. Lo! all mankind in brotherhood Shall study only to be good, And fling the sword of self away!â So chanted one inspired and fain His message to deliver To men who toiled upon the plain And bled along the river, And all the world was foul with crime! This prophet lived about the time That Lamech's wife bare Tubal-cain. AN UNREFORMABLE REFORMER I know not how they come aboutâ These alterations in our spelling, But sometimes am disposed to doubt The efficacy of compelling (As still is done to one in school By threatening to whack or twist him) Observance of an iron rule Despite one's better private system. For when the sinner's freed from fear He spells, as formerly, by ear. That's what I have observed, but much By that, I fear, is not decided Against the iron hand (whose touch May none experience, as I did) For under this White House rÃ©gime Condemning every silent letter, This is the motto, it would seem: âWho spells by ear spells all the better.â If that is what these pranks entail, Executive Compulsion, hail! God grant I know not envy nor, When chatting over cup and saucer, Betray my secret hunger for The high renown of Geoffrey Chaucer. Yet now at last I seem to see My way to equal approbation: When I'm as hard to read as he Phonetes of that far generation Will study me and say: âHow grand!â So difficult to understand!â The President, the President!â How enterprising in revision Of Nature's laws!âhow diligent In cutting out a court decision!â How sedulous the stars to woo And keep the seasons rightly going! Ah, seldom we remember who Establishes the time of sowing And reaping, makes the harvest good, And a great man of Leonard Wood. This world is variously bad, And mad as hares in January ('Tis later that the hares are mad, But similes and seasons vary) And Presidents have much to do To keep the March of Mind a-walking, To level up the birth rate, to Pain William Chandlerâall by talking. O Father Adam, how you must Rejoice that both your ears are dust! THE WORD-WAY IN PANAMA I dreamed I sailed along a tropic shore, The Line behind me and the Star before. A savage coast, it was, of wood and fen, And monkeys gabbled there, instead of men. Once, as the blessed sun his head upraised, On what a wondrous spectacle he gazed! A mile away upon the starboard beam Fell into ocean a deep sluggish stream, Yet not a drop of water passed its mouthâ Thy way, Kentucky, glory of the South! Words, words alone it âuttered to the day,â As if from Kansas it had gone astray. Yea, disemboguing grandly on the beach, Flowed thickly, viscidly, the parts of speech! Some, by their dead, incalculable weight Held to the bottom of that turbid strait, Slid seaward fathoms deep, nor saw the light That shone above their everlasting night! Some, such their levity, remained atop, Frolicked and flashedâdid everything but stop. Others, too grave to float, too light to sink, Forever rolled and tumbled on the brinkâ Spread north and south along the cumbered strand, And babbled ever between sea and land. Ah! 'twas a famous spectacle indeed, This wordy welter!âverbs that disagreed With nominatives; prepositions all Too weak to hold the objective case in thrall; Adverbs and adjectives disparted quite From parent-words and in a woful plight Of orphanage; conjunctions, interjections With truly anarchistic predilections; And pronouns whichâa gutter-blooded swarm!â Denied their antecedents in their form! Greatly I marveled whence this language cameâ No âwell of Englishâ like it could I name, Nor think how such a stream, however free Its flow, could wear a channel to the sea! As Hudson bears his never-failing fleet Of dead dogs, verdant, poddy and unsweet, To pile themselves upon the Jersey shore, Or in Sargasso's Sea rest evermore, So poured this torrent through its delta's breaches, And all these parts of speech were parts of speeches!â All gushing from that word-way like a flood Of swearing tomcats militant in mud! They leapt, they smelled, they clamored, like a line Of pagans faring to a sacred shrine! âNo more my heart the dismal din sustainedâ (See HomerâPope's translation) for it strained My sensesâthis uncouth, infragrant, hoarse âFine flow of languageâ from its Northern source. Cold drops of terror from my body broke!â I 'bouted ship, and from my dream awoke. 1902. THE JACK OF CLUBS Jerome, you are a mighty famous manâ District Attorney, I believe they call you. Some shout your praise as loudly as they can, And some, apparently, just live to maul you. But whether good or ill repute befall you, Your critics can't deny that, as a rule, You take it standingâthough the wits among Them say you stand, as does the singing mule, The better to perform your feats of lung. And, truly from the dawning to the gloaming, When in good voice, you're usually Jeroming. O, well, we must have musicâ'tis a need, Like Ibsen, Shaw or the âEdenic dietâ; Though sometimes silence is desiredâindeed, There's much that may be said in praise of quiet, And possibly you might do worse than try it. 'Twere better, anyhow, than fool advice To the police to club their fellow men, Too sore already. Sir, it is not nice To free your snouty virtues from the penâ Unless, as once in Gadara, they'll scamper Down a steep place to where 'tis greatly damper. Jerome, the best of us are those who care To hide from view the monsters that inhabit Our hearts, and when too closely questioned swear We've nothing fiercer than a sheep or rabbit. Seeing an opportunity, you grab it And lifting up the curtain, show the whole Menagerie of thoughts and feelings which Infest the secret places of your soul Like newts and water-puppies in a ditch. O, great reformer! hide from observation The unpleasing spectacle of Reformation. 1905. A NAVAL METHOD Captain Purvis, for aught we know, Never slew a Filipino; Played exceeding well at polo, But invited not the bolo. Though his form was big and burly, And his fist was hard and knurly, And his cocktail hour came early, Yet he was devoid of thirst For the blood of the accurst, Inconsiderate Tagallo (Seas of gore, however shallow, He regarded very lightly, As inutile and unsightly); So he did not much frequent That insurrectionary gent. Captain Purvis went a-scouting (Truth to tell, he took an outing)â Found a Filipino sleeping, Bound and took him into keeping. Calling Sergeant-Major Gump, They conveyed him to a pump, Laid him on his back beneath, With his tongue between his teeth. Said the captain: âWe'll not thump him, But he is a spyâwe'll pump him. That's our duty; information, Secrets useful to the nation, We'll wring from him. Tell me, sir, Tell me truly, why a cur Wags its tailâand, furthermore, When a door is not a door.â But that person obstinacious Answered, with a look ungracious, That he'd see them (he was witty) Both in Helfurstâthat's a city In Silesia, I suppose, Where no proper person goes. So they pumped him full of waterâ Son of Temperance, or Daughter, Ne'er was half so full as that, Nor any poison-fevered rat Trying with a fervor frantic To abolish the Atlantic. Yes, that Filipino bloated Till his snowy liver floated Like a lily on a pond. And his soul to the Beyond Drifted on the strong, full tide, âBy word of mouth,â from his inside. Captain Purvis being duly Tried, the President said: âTruly, He's a water-warrior; he Would more fitly serve at sea.â So the Navy broke his fallâ Rearest-Admiral of all! By his ironclad desk he's sitting, Sometimes writing, sometimes knitting, For he's Chief (and that's enough) Of the Bureau of Plum Duff. 1902. ANOTHER ASPIRANT George Dewey, dear, I did not think that youâ So very married and so happy, tooâ Would go philandering with another girl And give your gay mustache a fetching curl And set your capâI should say your cocked hatâ At Miss Columbia the like o' that. Pray what can you expect to get by throwing Sheep's eyes at one so very, very knowing? See how she served McKinley! All his life He wooed her for his morganatic wife, Swore that he loved her better than his soul (I'm half inclined to think, upon the whole, She better did deserve his love) then vowed He'd marry her alive, or even aloud! What did she? Ere his breath he could recover She heartlessly accepted that poor lover! There's William Bryan of the silver tongue, Old in ambition, in discretion youngâ He courts her with the song, the dance, the lute, But knows how suitors feel who do not suit. And Teddy Roosevelt, plucking from its sheath The weapon that he wears behind his teeth, Endeavors in his simple, soldier fashion, But all in vain, to touch her heart by slashin'. Beware, my web-foot friend, beware her wiles: Fly from her sighs and disregard her smiles. She's no fool mermaid with a comb and glass, But Satan's daughter with a breast of brass. Put out your prow to sea againâbut hold! If Bryan and McKinley, all too bold, Show up along the beach with little Teddyâ Well, Dewey, you may fire when you are ready. April, 1900. A LEARNER I do not think you rightly understand: My foolish tongue imperfectly has caught The trick of loving words, nor, as it ought, Serves the sweet purpose of the heart's command. Dear, I'm untraveled in the golden land Of love, and in its language all untaught, Like some poor mariner by tempest brought 'Mongst alien races to a foreign strand. So, pretty native, bear with me until My simple wants I rightly can avowâ My will to serve you with my men and ships. For lo! already I've some little skill In the strange tongue. Ask me to kiss you nowâ I'll read the riddle ere it leaves your lips! TO BRIDGET Have ye heard what the news is, me darlint? The Fenians have threatened the Pope! But, begorra, I think there's a snarl in't That's twisted it up like a rope, From a kink in the telescope. For the news, ye must know, Biddy, reaches This counthry by means of a wire; And sometimes the heat o' the speeches Just warrups it up like a fire. Faith! who but the Divil would bother The likes o' the Howly Father? And the Divil is in it, I'm fearin', When a gintleman's called on to chuse Betwixt Howly Church and Ould Erinâ The shamrock and harp to refuse, Or be like the murtherin' Jews. Och! Biddy, me mind it is troublin' To know where me body's at homeâ With half o' me sowl there in Dublin And t'other half over in Rome! Bedad, there's a shplit in the party Of the name of O'Malley McCarty! AFTER TENNYSON You ask me why, though ill at ease, Within this region I subsist, Where honor's dead, and law is hissed, And all men pillage as they please. It is the land where freemen kill In warm debate their party foes; The land where judges come to blows And speak the things that make us ill; A land of base expedient; A land where gold can justice drown; Where Freedom's chains are handed down From President to President; Where factions wrangle for the bread Of honest men; where, fearing naught, Accurst monopolies have caught The people in the nets they spread; Where branded convicts execute The laws that in a better time They broke, and every kind of crime Stalks unashamed and resolute. Should honor e'er possess the land, And patriots control the State, And Justice rise, divine with hate, To choke the politician band, O waft me from the harbor forth, Wild winds. I'll see Alaska's sky. Here 'twill have grown too warm, and I Will run for office in the North. TO MY BIRD If I were screaming in a cage, Parrot mine, parrot mine, And you were rhyming on this page, Parrot mine, I'd try to shriek a fresher bit Of wisdom to excite your wit, Parrot mine. All you have said is nothing new, Parrot mine, parrot mine, By Jove, I taught it all to you, Parrot mine. While you nor can, nor could, nor might Have thought what I could care to write, Parrot mine. Your life in order to maintain, Parrot mine, parrot mine, You daily dine upon my brain, Parrot mine. My mind, a torn and mangled wreck, Is disappearing down your neck, Parrot mine. Well, be it so: present your bill, Parrot mine, parrot mine, And on my virtues feast your fill, Parrot mine. My vices, though, will disagree With you, my pet. They do with me, Parrot mine. BUSINESS Two villains of the highest rank Set out one night to rob a bank. They found the building, looked it o'er, Each window noted, tried each door, Scanned carefully the lidded hole For minstrels to cascade the coalâ In short, examined five-and-twenty Short cuts from poverty to plenty. But all were sealed, they saw full soon, Against the minions of the moon. âEnough,â said one: âI'm satisfied.â The other, smiling fair and wide, Said: âI'm as highly pleased as you: No burglar ever can get through. Fate surely prospers our designâ The booty all is yours and mine.â So, full of hope, the following day To the exchange they took their way And bought, with manner free and frank, Some stock of that devoted bank; And they became, inside the year, One President and one Cashier. Their crime I can no further traceâ The means of safety to embrace, I overdrew and left the place. A POSSIBILITY If the wicked gods were willing (Pray it never may be true!) That a universal chilling Should ensue Of the sentiment of loving,â If they made a great undoing Of the plan of turtle-doving, Then farewell all poet-lore, Evermore. If there were no more of billing There would be no more of cooing And we all should be but owlsâ Lonely fowls Blinking wonderfully wise, With our great round eyesâ Sitting singly in the gloaming and no longer two and two, As unwilling to be wedded as unpracticed how to woo; With regard to being mated, Asking still with aggravated Ungrammatical acerbity: âTo who? To who?â TO A CENSOR The delay granted by the weakness and good nature of our judges is responsible for half the murders.â Daily Newspaper. Delay responsible? Why, then, my friend, Impeach Delay and you will make an end. Thrust vile Delay in jail and let it rot For doing all the things that it should not. Put not good-natured judges under bond, But make Delay in damages respond. Minos, Ãacus, Rhadamanthus, rolled Into one pitiless, unsmiling scoldâ Unsparing censor, be your thongs uncurled To âlash the rascals naked through the world.â The rascals? Nay, Rascality's the thing Above whose back your knotted scourges sing. Your satire, truly, like a razor keen, âWounds with a touch that's neither felt nor seen;â For naught that you assail with falchion free Has either nerves to feel or eyes to see. Against abstractions evermore you charge: You hack no helmet and you need no targe. That wickedness is wrong and sin a vice, That wrong's not right, nor foulness ever nice, Fearless affirm. All consequences dare: Smite the offense and the offender spare. When Ananias and Sapphira lied Falsehood, had you been there, had surely died. When money-changers in the Temple sat, At money-changing you'd have whirled the âcatâ (That John-the-Baptist of the modern pen) And all those brokers would have cried amen! Good friend, if any judge deserve your blame Have you no courage, or has he no name? Upon his method will you wreak your wrath, Himself all unmolested in his path? Fall to! fall to!âyour club no longer draw To beat the air or flail a man of straw. Scorn to do justice like the Saxon thrall Who cuffed the offender's shadow on a wall. Let rascals in the flesh attest your zealâ Knocked on the mazzard or tripped up at heel! We know that judges are corrupt. We know That crimes are lively and that laws are slow. We know that lawyers lie and doctors slay; That priests and preachers are but birds of pray; That merchants cheat and journalists for gold Flatter the vicious while at vice they scold. 'Tis all familiar as the simple lore That two policemen and two thieves make four. But since, while some are wicked some are good, (As trees may differ though they all are wood) Names here and there, to show whose head is hit, The bad would sentence and the good acquit. In sparing everybody none you spare: Rebukes most personal are least unfair. To fire at random if you still prefer, And swear at Dog but never kick a cur, Permit me yet one ultimate appeal To something that you understand and feel: Let thrift and vanity your heart persuadeâ You might be read if you would learn your trade. Good brother censors (you have doubtless guessed Not one of you but all are here addressed) Remember this: the shaft that seeks a heart Draws all eyes after it; an idle dart Shot at some shadow flutters o'er the green, Its flight unheeded and its fall unseen. âTHE WHOLE WORLD KINâ âLiars for witnesses; for lawyers brutes Willing to lose their souls to win their suits; Cowards for jurors, and for judge a clown Who ne'er took up the law, yet lays it down; Justice denied, authority abused, And the one blameless person the accusedâ Thy courts, my country, all these dreadful years, Move fools to laughter and the wise to tears.â So moaned an alien from beyond the foam. Come here, my lad, I think you'll feel at home. A FUTURE CONVERSATION If the coal strike is not settled satisfactorily I shall lead the wives of the miners in a march on Washington.â Mother Jones. âWhat is this I see, what is this I see In this year of our Lord 3003? What ruins are spread in confusion wide Over hill and plain by Potomac's side?â âThese, traveler, these are the leveled stones Attesting the prowess of Mother Jones.â âO plowman, I never in history grew To the high attainments of Smith Carew, Whose noble book, âThe Decline and Fall Of America,â holds the respect of all. Of Mother Jones I often have heard, But thoughtâpray pardon if I have erredâ That the ancient lady became renowned By embroidering cats on a velvet ground.â âYour error is wide, remote, extreme: Not the needle's shine, but the sabre's gleam Delighted of old her heroic soul And made her unloved of the Lords of Coal. In that distant day when the miner ârose,â And to spite his countenance severed his nose, And owners permitted each mine of the trust To fill up with water to lay his dust, She marshaled the women, with sabre and gun, And marched with banners on Washington.â âI see, I see in these ruins gray Through which you are urging your plowshare gay The work of their hands, slender and white, That plied the pick and the crowbar bright.â âThe cannon, my friend,âbut no harm was done, For before the city was overrun By the warrior-dames of that rebel rout The politicians had cleaned it out, And the stones that about the plain they spread Were served to the poor when they asked for bread.â âO affable plowman, I'd fain admire Your tale, but, alas, I'm myself a liar! Besides, I've a better one, which, mayhap, You'd like to be hearing.â âGiddap, giddap!â THE HESITATING VETERAN When I was young and full of faith And other fads that youngsters cherish A cry rose as of one that saith With emphasis: âHelp or I perish!â 'Twas heard in all the land, and men The sound were each to each repeating. It made my heart beat faster then Than any heart can now be beating. For the world is old and the world is grayâ Grown prudent and, I think, more witty. She's cut her wisdom teeth, they say, And doesn't now go in for Pity. Besides, the melancholy cry Was that of one, 'tis now conceded, Whose plight no one beneath the sky Felt half so poignantly as he did. Moreover, he was black. And yet That sentimental generation With an austere compassion set Its face and faith to the occasion. Then there were hate and strife to spare, And various hard knocks a-plenty; And I ('twas more than my true share, I must confess) took five-and-twenty. That all is over nowâthe reign Of love and trade stills all dissensions, And the clear heavens arch again Above a land of peace and pensions. The black chapâat the last we gave Him everything that he had cried for, Though many white chaps in the grave 'Twould puzzle to say what they died for. I hope he's better offâI trust That his society and his master's Are worth the price we paid, and must Continue paying, in disasters; But sometimes doubts press thronging round ('Tis mostly when my hurts are aching) If war for Union was a sound And profitable undertaking. 'Tis said they mean to take away The Negro's vote for he's unlettered. 'Tis true he sits in darkness day And night, as formerly, when fettered; But pray observeâhowe'er he vote To whatsoever party turning, He'll be with gentlemen of note And wealth and consequence and learning. With saints and sages on each side, How could a fool through lack of knowledge, Vote wrong? If learning is no guide Why ought one to have been in college? O Son of Day, O Son of Night! What are your preferences made of? I know not which of you is right, Nor which to be the more afraid of. The world is old and the world is bad, And creaks and grinds upon its axis; And man's an ape and the gods are mad!â There's nothing sure, not even our taxes. No mortal man can Truth restore, Or say where she is to be sought for. I know what uniform I woreâ O, that I knew which side I fought for! A YEAR'S âCASUALTIESâ Slain as they lay by the secret, slow, Pitiless hand of an unseen foe, Two score thousand old soldiers have crossed The river to join the loved and lost. In the space of a year their spirits fled, Silent and white, to the camp of the dead. One after one they fall asleep And the pension agents awake to weep, And orphaned statesmen are loud in their wail As the souls flit by on the evening gale. O Father of Battles, pray give us release From the horrors of peace, the horrors of peace! TO-DAY I saw a man who knelt in prayer, And heard him say: âI'll lay my inmost spirit bare To-day. âLord, for to-morrow and its need I do not pray; Let me upon my neighbor feed To-day. âLet me my duty duly shirk And run away From any form or phase of work To-day. âFrom Thy commands exempted still, Let me obey The promptings of my private will To-day. âLet me no word profane, no lie, Unthinking, say If any one is standing by To-day. âMy secret sins and vices grave Let none betray; The scoffer's jeers I do not crave To-day. âAnd if to-day my fortune all Should ebb away Help me on other men's to fall To-day. âSo, for to-morrow and its mite I do not pray; Just give me everything in sight To-day.â I cried: âAmen!â He rose and ran Like oil away. I said: âI've seen an honest man To-day.â AN ALIBI A famous journalist who long Had told the great unheaded throng Whate'er they thought, by day or night, Was true as Holy Writ, and right, Was caught inâwell, on second thought, It is enough that he was caught And, thrown into a jail, became The fuel of a public flame. âVox populi vox Dei,â said The jailer. Inxling bent his head Without remark: that motto good In bold-faced type had always stood Above the columns where his pen Had rioted in praise of men And all they saidâprovided he Was sure they mostly did agree. Meanwhile a sharp and bitter strife To take, or save, the culprit's life Or liberty (which, I suppose, Was much the same to him) arose Outside. The journal that his pen Adorned denounced his crimeâbut then Its editor in secret tried To have the indictment set aside. The opposition papers swore His father was a rogue before, And all his wife's relations were Like him and similar to her. They begged their readers to subscribe A dollar each to make a bribe That any Judge would feel was large Enough to prove the gravest chargeâ Unless, it might be, the Defense Put up superior evidence. The law's traditional delay Was all too short: the trial day Dawned red and menacing. The Judge Sat on the Bench and wouldn't budge, And all the motions counsel made Could not move himâand there he stayed. âThe case must now proceed,â he said, âWhile I am just, in heart and head. It happensâas, indeed, it oughtâ Both sides with equal sums have bought My favor: I can try the cause Impartially.â (Prolonged applause.) The prisoner was now arraigned And said that he was greatly pained To be suspectedâhe, whose pen Had charged so many other men With crimes and misdemeanors! âWhy,â He said, a tear in either eye, âIf men who live by crying out âStop thief!â are not themselves from doubt Of their integrity exempt Let all forego the vain attempt To make a reputation! Sir, I'm innocent, and I demur.â Whereat a thousand voices cried That he indubitably liedâ Vox populi as loudly roared As bull by picadores gored, In his own coin receiving pay To make a Spanish holiday. The juryâtwelve good men and trueâ Were then sworn in to see it through, And each made solemn oath that he As any babe unborn was free From prejudice, opinion, thought, Respectability, brainsâaught That could disqualify; and some Explained that they were deaf and dumb. A better twelve, his Honor said, Was rare, except among the dead. The witnesses were called and sworn. The tales they told made angels mourn, And the Good Book they'd kissed became Red with the consciousness of shame. Whenever one of them approached The truth, âThat witness wasn't coached, Your Honor!â cried the lawyers both. âStrike out his testimony,â quoth The learned Judge; âthis court denies Its ear to stories that surprise. I hold that witnesses exempt From coaching all are in contempt.â Both Prosecution and Defense Applauded the judicial sense, And the spectators all averred Such wisdom they had never heard: 'Twas plain the prisoner would be Found guilty in the first degree. Meanwhile that wight's pale cheek confessed The nameless terrors in his breast. He felt remorseful, too, because He wasn't half they said he was. âIf I'd been such a rogue,â he mused On opportunities unused, âI might have easily become As wealthy as Methusalum.â This journalist adorned, alas, The middle, not the Bible, class. With equal skill the lawyers' pleas Attested their divided fees. Each gave the other one the lie, Then helped him frame a sharp reply. Good Lord! it was a bitter fight, And lasted all the day and night. When once or oftener the roar Had silenced the judicial snore The speaker suffered for the sport By fining for contempt of court. Twelve jurors' noses good and true Unceasing sang the trial through, And even vox populi was spent In rattles through a nasal vent. Clerk, bailiff, constables and all Heard Morpheus sound the trumpet call To armsâhis armsâand all fell in Save counsel for the Man of Sin. That thaumaturgist stood and swayed The wand their faculties obeyedâ That magic wand, which, like a flame, Leaped, wavered, quivered and became A wonder-workerâknown among The ignoble vulgar as a Tongue. How long, O Lord, how long my verse Runs on for better or for worse In meter which o'ermasters me, Octosyllabically free!â A meter, which, the poets say, No power of restraint can stay;â A hard-mouthed meter, suited well To him who, having naught to tell, Must hold attention as a trout Is held by paying out and out The slender line which else would break Should one attempt the fish to take. Thus tavern guides who've naught to show But some adjacent curio By devious trails their patrons lead And make them think 'tis far indeed. Where was I? While the lawyer talked The rogue took up his feet and walked: While all about him loudly slept, Into the street he calmly stepped. In very truth, the man who thought The people's voice from heaven had caught God's inspiration took a change Of venueâit was passing strange! Straight to his editor he went And that ingenious person sent A Negro to impersonate The fugitive. In adequate Disguise he took the vacant place And buried in his arms his face. When all was done the lawyer stopped And silence like a bombshell dropped Upon the court: Judge, jury, all Within that venerable hall (Except the deaf and dumb, indeed, And one or two whom death had freed) Awoke and tried to look as though Slumber was all they did not know. And now that tireless lawyer-man Took breath, and then again began: âYour Honor, if you did attend To what I've urged (my learned friend Nodded concurrence) to support The motion I have made, this court May soon adjourn. With your assent I've shown abundant precedent For introducing now, though late, New evidence to exculpate My client. So, if you'll allow, I'll prove an alibi!â âWhat?âhow?â Stammered the Judge. âWell, yes, I can't Deny your showing, and I grant The motion. Do I understand You undertake to proveâgood land!â That when the crimeâyou mean to show Your client wasn't there?â âO, no, I cannot quite do that, I find: My alibi's another kind Of alibiâI'll make it clear, Your Honor, that he isn't here.â The Darky here upreared his head, Tranquillity affrighted fled And consternation reigned instead! A MEETING âGood morning,â said Garfield, extending his hand, To Mr. Parnell in the Heavenly Land. âGood morning, good morning,â said Mr. Parnell; âI hope (though 'tis needless to ask) you are well. How sweetly that chorus of cherubim sings! Pray how do you manage these cumbersome wings? This haloâI dare say I'm terribly green, But somehow I can't make it hold my dudheen. This harp is all right, but the shamrock I miss, AndâO, by the way, in this region of bliss I trust that the rascally schemer who wrote The Morey epistle, which lost you the vote Electoral, I am not likely to meet?â Then Garfield, his eyes on the cloud at his feet, Burned in the cheeks with a fervor divine That conquered his halo's inferior shine; Then said, with a look that was level and far: âI fear (to be honest and frank) that you are. The person who wrote that mysterious, queer, Bad letter is hereâah, exceedingly here.â And he smiled in an infantile sort of a way, Like a man with a qualm, and went on to say: âI'm happy to meet you. What news from below? Did it look when you left there as if they would show Who wrote, with a villainous purpose in view, The peppery letters imputed to you?â Said Mr. Parnell: âYes, it did, I must sayâ In fact, that's the reason I hastened away.â Then they sang a psalm, and they sang so well That Murchison heard it while sobbing in Hell. J. F. B. How well this man unfolded to our view The world's beliefs of Death and Heaven and Hellâ This man whose own convictions none could tell, Nor if his maze of reason had a clew. Dogmas he wrote for daily bread, but knew The fair philosophies of doubt so well That while we listened to his words there fell Some that were strangely comforting if true. Marking how wise we grew upon his doubt, We said: âIf so, by groping in the night, He can proclaim some certain paths of trust, How great our profit if he saw about His feet the highways leading to the light.â Now he sees all. Ah, Christ! his mouth is dust! THE DYING STATESMAN It is a politician manâ He draweth near his end, And friends weep round that partisan, Of every man the friend. Between the Known and the Unknown He lieth on the strand; The light upon the sea is thrown That lay upon the land. It shineth in his glazing eye, It burneth on his face; God send that when we come to die We know that sign of grace! Upon his lips his blessed sprite Poiseth her joyous wing. âHow is it with thee, child of light? Dost hear the angels sing?â âThe song I hear, the crown I see, And know that God is love. Farewell, dark worldâI go to be A postmaster above!â For him no monumental arch, But, O, 'tis good and brave To see the Grand Old Party march To office o'er his grave! THE DEATH OF GRANT Father! whose hard and cruel law Is part of thy compassion's plan, Thy works presumptuously we scan For what the prophets say they saw. Unbidden still the awful slope Walling us in we climb to gain Assurance of the shining plain That faith has certified to hope. In vain!âbeyond the circling hill The shadow and the cloud abide. Subdue the doubt, our spirits guide To trust the record and be still. To trust it loyally as he Who, heedful of his high design, Ne'er raised a seeking eye to thine, But wrought thy will unconsciously, Disputing not of chance or fate, Nor questioning of cause or creed; For anything but duty's deed Too simply wise, too humbly great. The cannon syllabled his name; His shadow shifted o'er the land, Portentous, as at his demand Successive bastions sprang to flame! He flared the continent with fire, The rivers ran in lines of light! Thy will be done on earthâif right Or wrong he cared not to inquire. His was the heavy hand, and his The service of the despot blade; His the soft answer that allayed War's giant animosities. Let us have peace: our clouded eyes, Fill, Father, with another light, That we may see with clearer sight Thy servant's soul in Paradise. THE FOUNTAIN REFILLED Of Hans Pietro Shanahan (Who was a most ingenious man) The Muse of History records That he'd get drunk as twenty lords. He'd get so truly drunk that men Stood by to marvel at him when His slow advance along the street Was but a vain cycloidal feat. And when 'twas fated that he fall With a wide, geographic sprawl, They signified assent by sounds Heard (faintly) at its utmost bounds. And yet this Mr. Shanahan (Who was a most ingenious man) Cast not on wine his thirsty eyes When it was red or otherwise. All malt or spirituous tope He loathed as cats dissent from soap; And cider, if it touched his lip, Evoked a groan at every sip. But still, as heretofore explained, He not infrequently was grained. (I'm not of those who call it âcornedââ Coarse speech I've always duly scorned.) Though, truth to say, and that's but right, Strong drink (it hath an adder's bite!) Was what had put him in the mud, The only kind he used was blood! Alas that an immortal soul Addicted to the flowing bowl The emptied flagon should again Replenish from a neighbor's vein! But, Mr. Shanahan was so Constructed, and his taste that low. Not more deplorable was he In kind of thirst than in degree; For sometimes fifty souls would pay The debt of nature in a day To free him from the shame and pain Of dread Sobriety's misreign. His native land, with a proud sense Of his unique inabstinence, Abated something of its pride At thought of his unfilled inside; And some the boldness had to say 'Twere well if he were called away To slake his thirst for evermore In oceans of celestial gore. But Hans Pietro Shanahan (Who was a most ingenious man) Knew that his thirst was mortal; so Remained unsainted here belowâ Unsainted and unsaintly, for He neither went to glory nor To abdicate his power deigned Where, under Providence, he reigned, But kept his Boss's power accurst To serve his wild uncommon thirst, Which now had grown so truly great It was a drain upon the State. Soon, soon there came a time, alas! When he turned down an empty glassâ All practicable means were vain His special wassail to obtain. In vain poor Decimation tried To furnish forth the needful tide; And Civil War as vainly shed Its niggard offering of red. Poor Shanahan! his thirst increased Until he wished himself deceased, Invoked the firearm and the knife, But could not die to save his life! He was so dry his own veins made No answer to the seeking blade; So weak that when he would have passed Away he could not breathe his last. 'Twas then, when almost in despair, (Unlaced his shoon, unkempt his hair) He saw as in a dream a way To wet afresh his mortal clay. Yes, Hans Pietro Shanahan (Who was a most ingenious man) Saw freedom, and with joy and pride âThalassa! (or Thalatta!)â cried. Straight to the alderman went he, With many a âpullâ and many a fee, And many a most corrupt âcombineâ (The Press for twenty cents a line Held out and fought himâO God bless Forevermore the holy Press!) Till he had franchises complete For trolley lines on every street! The cars were builded and, they say, Were run on rails laid every wayâ Rhomboidal roads, and circular, And ovalâeverywhere a carâ Square, dodecagonal (in great Esteem the form called Figure 8) And many other kinds of form As different as paths of storm. No other group of men's abodes E'er had so odd electric roads, Which, winding in and winding out, Began and ended all about. No city had, unless in Mars, That city's fatal gift of cars. They ran by day, they flew by night, And O, the sorry, sorry sight! And Hans Pietro Shanahan (Who was a most ingenious man) Incessantly, the Muse records, Lay drunk as twenty thousand lords! LAUS LUCIS Theosophists are about to build a âTemple for the Revival of the Mysteries of Antiquity.ââ Vide the Newspapers, passim. Each to his taste: some men prefer to play At mystery, and others at piquet. Some sit in mystic meditation; some Parade the street with tambourine and drum. One studies to decipher ancient lore Which, proving stuff, he studies all the more; Another swears that learning is but good To darken things already understood, Then writes upon Simplicity so well That none agree on what he wants to tell, And future ages will declare his pen Inspired by gods with messages to men. To found an ancient order, these devote Their timeâwith ritual, regalia, goat, Blankets for tossing, chairs of little ease And all the modern inconveniences; Those, saner, frown upon unmeaning rites And go to church for rational delights. So all are suited, shallow and profound, The prophets prosper and the world goes round. For meâunread in the occult, I'm fain To damn all mysteries alike as vain, Spurn the obscure and base my faith upon The Revelations of the good St. John. NANINE We heard a song-bird trillingâ 'Twas but a day ago. Such rapture he was rilling As only we could know. This morning he is flinging His music from the tree, But something in the singing Is not the same to me. His inspiration fails him, Or he has lost his skill. Nanine, Nanine, what ails him That he should sing so ill? Nanine is not replyingâ She hears no earthly song. The sun and bird are lying And the night is, O, so long! TECHNOLOGY 'Twas a serious person with locks of gray And a figure like a crescent; His gravity, clearly, had come to stay, But his smile was evanescent. He stood and conversed with a neighbor and With (likewise) a high falsetto; And he stabbed his forefinger into his hand As if it had been a stiletto. His words, like the notes of a tenor drum, Came out of his head unblended, And the wonderful altitude of some Was exceptionally splendid. While executing a shake of the head, With the hand, as it were, of a master, This agonizing old gentleman said: â'Twas a truly sad disaster! âFour hundred and ten longs and shorts in all, Went downââhe paused and snuffled. A single tear was observed to fall, And the old man's drum was muffled. âA very calamitous year,â he said, And again his head-piece hoary He shook, and another pearl he shed, As if he wept con amore. âO lacrymose person,â I cried, âpray why Should these failures so affect you? With speculators in stocks no eye That's normal would ever connect you.â He focused his orbs upon mine and smiled In a sinister sort of manner. âYoung man,â he said, âyour words are wild: I spoke of the steamship âHanner.â âFor she has went down in a howlin' squall, And my heart is nigh to breakin'â Four hundred and ten longs and shorts in all Will never need undertakin'! âI'm in the business myself,â said he, âAnd you've mistook my expression; For I uses the technical terms, you see, Employed in my perfession.â That old undertaker has joined the throng On the other side of the River, But I'm still unhappy to think I'm a âlong,â And a tape-line makes me shiver. A REPLY TO A LETTER O nonsense, parsonâtell me not they thrive And jubilate who follow your dictation. The good are the unhappiest lot aliveâ I know they are from careful observation. If freedom from the terrors of damnation Lengthens the visage like a telescope, And lacrymosity's a sign of hope, Then I'll continue, in my dreadful plight, To tread the dusky paths of sin, and grope Contentedly without your lantern's light; And though in many a bog beslubbered quite, Refuse to flay me with ecclesiastic soap. You say 'tis a sad world, seeing I'm condemned, With many a million others of my kidney. Each continent's Hammed, Japheted and Shemmed With sinnersâworldlings like Sir Philip Sidney And scoffers like Voltaire, who thought it bliss To simulate respect for Genesisâ Who bent the mental knee as if in prayer, But mocked at Moses underneath his hair, And like an angry gander bowed his head to hiss. Seeing such as these, who die without contrition, Must go toâbeg your pardon, sirâperdition, The sons of light, you tell me, can't be gay, But count it sin of the sort called omission The groan to smother or the tear to stay Or fail toâwhat is that they live by?âpray. So down they kneel, and the whole serious race is Put by divine compassion on a praying basis. Well, if you take it so to heart, while yet Our own hearts are so light with nature's leaven, You'll weep indeed when we in Hades sweat, And you look down upon us out of Heaven. In fancy, lo! I see your wailing shades Thronging the crystal battlements. Cascades Of tears spring singing from each golden spout, Run roaring from the verge with hoarser sound, Dash downward through the glimmering profound, Quench the tormenting flame and put the Devil out! Presumptuous fool! to you no power belongs To pitchfork me to Heaven upon the prongs Of a bad pen, whose disobedient sputter, With less of ink than incoherence fraught, Befits the folly that it tries to utter. Brains, I observe, as well as tongues, can stutter: You suffer from impediment of thought, Save when considering your bread-and-butter. When next you âpoint the way to Heaven,â take care: Your fingers being thumbs, point Heaven knows where! Farewell, poor dunce! your letter though I blame, Bear witness how my anger I can tame: I've called you everything except your hateful name! TO OSCAR WILDE Because from Folly's lips you got Some babbled mandate to subdue The realm of Common Sense, and you Made promise and considered not,â Because you strike a random blow At what you do not understand, And beckon with a friendly hand To something that you do not know, I hold no speech of your desert, Nor baffle with porrected shield The wooden weapon that you wield, But meet you with a cast of dirt. Dispute with such a thing as youâ Twin show to the two-headed calf? Why, sir, if I repress my laugh, 'Tis more than half the world can do. 1882. BORN LEADERS OF MEN Tuckerton Tamerlane Morey Mahosh Is a statesman of world-wide fame, With a notable knack at rhetorical bosh To glorify somebody's nameâ Somebody chosen by Tuckerton's masters To succor the country from divers disasters Portentous to Mr. Mahosh. Percy O'Halloran Tarpy Cabee Is in the political swim. He cares not a button for men, not he: Great principles captivate himâ Principles cleverly cut out and fitted To Percy's capacity, duly admitted And fought for by Mr. Cabee. Drusus Tum Swinnerton Porfer Fitzurse Holds office the most of his life. For men nor for principles cares he a curse But much for his neighbor's wife. The Ship of State leaks, but he doesn't pump anyâ Messrs. Mahosh, Cabee &amp; Company Pump for good Mr. Fitzurse. THE CRIME OF 1903 Time was, not very long ago, As by historians time is reckoned, When first of virtues here below Was hatred of secession, though Some swore it wasn't even second; But these (they mostly were down South) Have all renounced their view with candorâ Some tardily by word of mouth, Some, earlier, in a manner grander. To stamp their error out, 'tis true, We paid enough of blood (the treasure Would pave with gold an avenue) To float a battleship or two, If so the cost we choose to measure. 'Twas worth it all, we say and sayâ The President has often said it; And so it wasâto us; and they Say nothing, as a rule, who shed it. âTimes change and we change with them,â men Of old renown averred in Latin; And that's as true on tongue or pen This blessed century as when The seat of empire CÃ¦sar sat in. For see how many play their parts As ardent lovers of secession, Promoting it with all their heartsâ In countries out of our possession. O men of variable views, How can you be so light and fickle? Is it because you think the news From Panama portends no bruise To you, nor payment of a nickel? Nay, is it that you scent a gain In troubles of a neighbor nation, And so appraise her loss and pain As nothing worth a valuation? Those ills 'tis easy to endure That light upon and sting anotherâ That's Christian fortitude; but sure There's somewhere an account of your Least feeling toward a hapless brother. Himself may show by deed and speech Less racial sympathies than tribal, Butâwell, this is no place to preach; The sermon's mostly in the Bible. We're false to trust and quick to spy The fissure in a friendly armor, Even Freedom can no more rely Upon our promise not to harm her. O Guardian of Continents, My country! shall that evil dower, The passion for preÃ«minence, Cry from thy seaward battlements A soul already drunk with power? 1903. FOR EXPULSION They say, Brig. Roberts, you have seven wives, And every one a beauty! As to that I'm not informed; in the domestic hives Of Utah, where I've sometimes hung my hat, Not all the dames were comely. Like a cat That has nine lives and must support them all, You have to hustle round a bit, I fancy. Now don't you really agree with Paul That women are the devil?âeven Nancy And Mary Jane and Caroline and Ella And Ruth and Adeline and Isabella! If I had half as many wives as you (That's three wives and a half as I compute) I hardly know what I'd be driven to. I might in desperation play the flute, Or Congress find in me a raw recruit. Then, I suppose, the country would uprise And say the things I least should care to hear: And virtuous editors would damn my eyes, And cartilaginous virgins pain my ear, And now and then some pious person clamor, Blessed with one wife, ten wenches and no grammar. All that and more you're suffering, my friend, For, having married all the maids you saw, You contumaciously refuse to bend A corrigible back to altered law And leave them (all but one) lamenting. Pshaw! Don't be so squeamish. Yes, the children may Lament a little too when made acquainted With their mischance in being put away, And your own countenance with shame be painted; But that's the smallest price for which we'll sell A seat in Congress and a bed in Hell. JUDEX JOCOSUS We blench when maniacs to dance begin. What makes a skull so dreadful is the grin. When horrible and ludicrous unite, Our sense of humor does but feed our fright. As the shocked spirit with a double dread Might see a monkey watching by the dead, Or headsman part a neck, without a fault, While turning o'er the block a somersault. So, Judge Hilario, the untroubled awe And reverence men cherish for the law Turn all to terror when with wit profound And tricksy humor you the law expound. More frightful sounds the felon's doom by half From lips still twisted to an idiot laugh. âGRAFTâ Cuba, our pupil, let thy glory shineâ Our own is brighter, but effulgent thine! Lately thine arms struck terror to the foe, And now thy hands bring treasuries to woe! Daughter of Terrors, Mother of Alarms, Courage himself may fly before thine arms; But O, what thing escapes, what thing withstands, The power of those comprehensive hands? THE TALE OF A CRIME Once, in the olden time, a certain King (But where he reigned I know not) said: âGo bring My Chief Adviser here before the throne, And cut his head off clear down to the bone!â âWith pleasure, Sire,â saidâkeen to earn his wageâ The High Dissuader from the Sin of Age; âBut kings should still be civil, even when just: You'll charge the villain with some crime, I trust?â âWhy, that's no more than fair,â the King replied. They brought the culprit in, securely tied, And the King said: âLet some one who can read Stand forward and unfold the Golden Screed, Bright with the names of all the sins and crimes And vices ever known from ancient times. We'll fit the fellow for the headsman's prank With one appropriate to his face and rank.â In drowsy monotone the Lector read The shining list, beginning at the head. (LÃ¨se majestÃ© was naturally firstâ Of crimes conceivable, the blackest, worst!) As each was named the prisoner addressed The throne and, as the law compelled, confessed. 'Twas fatal not to: in that olden day Little was heard about the law's delay. But still the royal taste could find for him No crime well suited to the royal whim, And, wearied by the reader's droning voice, The sovereign fell asleep, nor made a choiceâ Snored like an organ till the stones were jarred Distinguishing the palace from the yard. Meantime, the accused continued to confess, Each nod said âguiltyâ and each look said âyes.â And still the monarch slept: each courtier feared To wake him lest himself should âlose his beard.â ('Twas a fine euphemism, and meant his headâ Some things for prudence are obliquely said.) âFinis,â the reader said, and roundabout Fell silence like a loud awakening shout! The startled sovereign left a snore half-snoredâ âThat's what the scoundrel's guilty of!â he roared. So there before the king upon his throne They cut his head off clean down to the bone! And all the devils made a joyous din To celebrate the new and lovely sin. TO THE BARTHOLDI STATUE O Liberty, God-giftedâ Young and immortal maidâ In your high hand uplifted, The torch declares your trade. Its crimson menace, flaming Upon the sea and shore, Is, trumpet-like, proclaiming That Law shall be no more. Austere incendiary, We're blinking in the light; Where is your customary Grenade of dynamite? Where are your staves and switches For men of gentle birth? Your mask and dirk for riches? Your chains for wit and worth? Perhaps, you've brought the halters You used in the old days, When round religion's altars You stabled Cromwell's bays? Behind you, unsuspected, Have you the axe, fair wench, Wherewith you once collected A poll-tax from the French? America salutes youâ Preparing to âdisgorge.â Take everything that suits you, And marry Henry George. 1894. AN UNMERRY CHRISTMAS Christmas, you tell me, comes but once a year. One place it never comes, and that is here. Here, in these pages no good wishes spring, No well-worn greetings tediously ringâ For Christmas greetings are like pots of ore: The hollower they are they ring the more. Here shall no holly cast a spiny shade, Nor mistletoe my solitude invade, No trinket-laden vegetable come, No jorum steam with Sheolate of rum. No shrilling children shall their voices rear. Hurrah for Christmas without Christmas cheer! No presents, if you pleaseâI know too well What Herbert Spencer, if he didn't tell (I know not if he did) yet might have told Of present-giving in the days of old, When Early Man with gifts propitiated The chiefs whom most he doubted, feared and hated, Or tendered them in hope to reap some rude Advantage from the taker's gratitude. Since thus the Gift its origin derives (How much of its first character survives You know as well as I) my stocking's tied, My pocket buttonedâwith my soul inside. I save my money and I save my pride. Dinner? Yes; thank youâjust a baby's body Done to a nutty brown, and a tear toddy To give me appetite; and as to drink, About a half a jug of blood, I think, Will do; for still I love that good red wine, Coagulating well, with wrinkles fine Fretting the satin surface of its flood. O tope of kingsâdivine Falernianâblood! Duse take the shouting fowls upon the limb, The kneeling cattle and the rising hymn! Has not a pagan rights to be regardedâ His heart assaulted and his ear bombarded With sentiments and sounds that good old Pan Even in his demonium would ban? No, friendsâno Christmas here, for I have sworn To keep my heart hard and my knees unworn. Enough you have of jester, player, priest: I as the skeleton attend your feast, In the mad revelry to make a lull With shaken finger and with bobbing skull. However you my services may flout, Philosophy disdain and reason doubt, I mean to hold in customary state, My dismal revelry and celebrate My yearly rite until the crack o' doom,â Ignore the cheerful season's warmth and bloom And cultivate an oasis of gloom. FROM VIRGINIA TO PARIS The polecat, sovereign of its native wood, Dashes damnation upon bad and good; The health of all the upas trees impairs By exhalations deadlier than theirs; Poisons the rattlesnake and warts the toadâ The creeks go rotten and the rocks corrode! She shakes o'er breathless hill and shrinking dale The horrid aspergillus of her tail! From every saturated hair, till dry, The spargent fragrances divergent fly, Stifle the world and reek along the sky! Removed to alien scenes, amid the strife Of urban odors to ungladden lifeâ Where gas and sewers and dead dogs conspire The flesh to torture and the soul to fireâ Where all the âwell defined and several stinksâ Known to mankind hold revel and high jinksâ Humbled in spirit, smitten with a sense Of lost distinction, leveled eminence, Her powers atrophied, her vigor sunk, She lives deodorized, a sweeter skunk. A âMUTE INGLORIOUS MILTONâ âO, I'm the Unaverage Man, But you never have heard of me, For my brother, the Average Man, outran My fame with rapiditee, And I'm sunk in Oblivion's sea; But my bully big brother the world can span With his wide notorietee. I do everything that I can To make 'em attend to me, But the papers ignore the Unaverage Man With a weird uniformitee.â So sang with a dolorous note A voice that I heard from the beach; On the sable waters it seemed to float Like a mortal part of speech. The sea was Oblivion's sea, And I cried as I plunged to swim: âThe Unaverage Man shall reside with me.â But he didn'tâI stayed with him! THE FREE TRADER'S LAMENT Oft from a trading-boat I purchased spice And shells and corals, brought for my inspection From the fair tropicsâpaid a Christian price And was content in my fool's paradise, Where never had been heard the word âProtection.â 'Twas my sole island; there I dwelt aloneâ No customs-house, collector nor collection, But a man came who in a pious tone Condoled with me that I had never known The manifest advantage of Protection. So when the trading-boat arrived one day He threw a stink-pot into its mid-section. The traders paddled for their lives away, Nor came again into that haunted bay, The blessed home thereafter of Protection. Then down he sat, that philanthropic man, And spat upon some mud of his selection, And worked it with his knuckles in a pan To shapes of shells and coral things, and span A thread of song in glory of Protection. He baked them in the sun. His air devout Enchanted me. I made a genuflexion: âGod help you, gentle sir,â I said. âNo doubt,â He answered gravely, âI'll get on without Assistance now that we have got Protection.â Thenceforth I bought his waresâat what a price For shells and corals of such imperfection! âAh, now,â said he, âyour lot is truly nice.â But still in all that isle there was no spice To season to my taste that dish, Protection. SUBTERRANEAN PHANTASIES I died. As meekly in the earth I lay, With shriveled fingers reverently folded, The wormâuncivil engineer!âmy clay Tunneled industriously, and the mole did. My body could not dodge them, but my soul did; For that had flown from this terrestrial ball And I was rid of it for good and all. So there I lay, debating what to doâ What measures might most usefully be taken To circumvent the subterranean crew Of anthropophagi and save my bacon. My fortitude was all the while unshaken, But any gentleman, of course, protests Against receiving uninvited guests. However proud he might be of his meats, Not even Apicius, nor, I think, Lucullus, Wasted on tramps his culinary sweets; âAut CÃ¦sar,â say judicious hosts, âaut nullus.â And though when Marcius came unbidden Tullus Aufidius feasted him because he starved, Marcius by Tullus afterward was carved. We feed the hungry, as the book commands (For men might question else our orthodoxy) But do not care to see the outstretched hands, And so we minister to them by proxy. When Want, in his improper person, knocks he Finds we're engaged. The graveworm's very fresh To think we like his presence in the flesh. So, as I said, I lay in doubt; in all That underworld no judges could determine My rights. When Death approaches them they fall, And falling, naturally soil their ermine. And still below ground, as above, the vermin That work by dark and silent methods win The caseâthe burial-case that one is in. Cases at law so slowly get ahead, Even when the right is visibly unclouded, That if all men are classed as quick and dead, The judges all are dead, though some unshrouded. Pray Jove that when they're actually crowded On Styx's brink, and Charon rows in sight, His bark prove worse than Cerberus's bite. Ah! Cerberus, if you had but begot A race of three-mouthed dogs for man to nourish And women to caress, the muse had not Lamented the decay of virtues currish, And triple-hydrophobia now would flourish. For barking, biting, kissing to employ Canine repeaters were indeed a joy. Lord! how we cling to this vile world! Here I, Whose dust was laid ere I began this carping, By moles and worms and such familiar fry Run through and through, am singing still and harping Of mundane mattersâflatting, too, and sharping. I hate the Angel of the Sleeping-Cup: So I'm for gettingâand for shuttingâup. IN MEMORIAM Beauty (they called her) wasn't a maid Of many things in the world afraid. She wasn't a maid who turned and fled At sight of a mouse, alive or dead. She wasn't a maid a man could âshooâ By shouting, however abruptly, âBoo!â She wasn't a maid who'd run and hide If her face and figure you idly eyed. She wasn't a maid who'd blush and shake When asked what part of the fowl she'd take. (I blush myself to confess she preferred, And commonly got, the most of the bird.) She wasn't a maid to simper because She was asked to singâif she ever was. In short, if the truth must be displayed All nakedâBeauty wasn't a maid. Beauty, furry and fine and fat, Yawny and clawy, sleek and all that, Was a pampered and spoiled Angora cat! I loved her well, and I'm proud that she Wasn't indifferent, quite, to me; In fact I have sometimes gone so far (You know, mesdames, how silly men are) As to think she preferredâexcuse the conceitâ My legs upon which to sharpen her feet. Perhaps it shouldn't have counted for much, But I started and thrilled beneath her touch! Ah, well, that's ancient history now: The fingers of Time have touched my brow, And I hear with never a start to-day That Beauty has passed from the earth away. Gone!âher death-song (it killed her) sung. Gone!âher fiddlestrings all unstrung. Gone to the bliss of a new rÃ©gime Of turkey smothered in seas of cream; Of roasted mice (a superior breed, To science unknown and the coarser need Of the living cat) cooked by the flame Of the dainty soul of an erring dame Who had given to purity all her care, Neglecting the duty of daily prayer,â Crisp, delicate mice, just touched with spice By the ghost of a breeze from Paradise; A very digestible sort of mice. Let scoffers sneer, I purpose to hold That Beauty has mounted the Stair of Gold, To eat and eat, forever and aye, On a velvet rug from a golden tray. But the human spiritâthat is my creedâ Rots in the ground like a barren seed. That is my creed, abhorred by Man But approved by Cat since time began. Till Death shall kick at me, thundering âScat!â I shall hold to that, I shall hold to that. THE STATESMEN How blest the land that counts among Her sons so many good and wise, To execute great feats of tongue When troubles rise. Behold them mounting every stump, By speech our liberty to guard. Observe their courageâsee them jump, And come down hard! âWalk up, walk up!â each cries aloud, âAnd learn from me what you must do To turn aside the thunder cloud, The earthquake too. âBeware the wiles of yonder quack Who stuffs the ears of all that pass. IâI alone can show that black Is white as grass.â They shout through all the day and break The silence of the night as well. They'd makeâI wish they'd go and makeâ Of Heaven a Hell. A advocates free silver, B Free trade and C free banking laws. Free board, clothes, lodging would from me Win warm applause. Lo, D lifts up his voice: âYou see The single tax on land would fall On all alike.â More evenly No tax at all. âWith paper money,â bellows E, âWe'll all be rich as lords.â No doubtâ And richest of the lot will be The chap without. As many âcuresâ as addle-wits Who know not what the ailment is! Meanwhile the patient foams and spits Like a gin fizz. Alas, poor Body Politic, Your fate is all too clearly read: To be not altogether quick, Nor very dead. You take your exercise in squirms, Your rest in fainting fits between. 'Tis plain that your disorder's wormsâ Worms fat and lean. Worm Capital, Worm Labor dwell Within your maw and muscle's scope. Their quarrels make your life a Hell, Your death a hope. God send you find not such an end To ills however sharp and huge! God send you convalesce! God send You vermifuge. BROTHERS SceneâA lawyer's dreadful den. Enter stall-fed citizen. Lawyer. âMornin'. How-de-do? Citizen. Sir, same to you. Called as counsel to retain you In a case that I'll explain you. Sad, so sad! Heart almost broke. Hang it! where's my kerchief? Smoke? Brother, sir, and I, of late, Came into a large estate. Brother'sâh'm, ha,ârather queer Sometimes [tapping forehead] here. What he needsâyou knowâa âwritââ Something, eh? that will permit Me to manage, sir, in fine, His estate, as well as mine. Of course he'll storm; 'twill break, I fear, His loving heartâexcuse this tear. Lawyer. âHave you nothing more? All of this you said beforeâ When last night I took your case. Citizen. âWhy, sir, your face Ne'er before has met my view! Lawyer. âEh? The devil! True: My mistakeâit was your brother. But you're very like each other. THE CYNIC'S BEQUEST In that fair city, Ispahan, There dwelt a problematic man, Whose angel never was released, Who never once let out his beast, But kept, through all the seasons' round, Silence unbroken and profound. No Prophecy, with ear applied To key-hole of the future, tried Successfully to catch a hint Of what he'd do nor when begin't; As sternly did his past defy Mild Retrospection's backward eye. Though all admired his silent ways, The women loudest were in praise: For ladies love those men the most Who never, never, never boastâ Who ne'er disclose their aims and ends To naughty, naughty, naughty friends. Yet, sooth to say, the fame outran The merit of this doubtful man, For taciturnity in him, Though not a mere caprice nor whim, Was not a virtue, such as truth, High birth, or beauty, wealth or youth. 'Twas known, indeed, throughout the span Of Ispahan, of Gulistanâ These utmost limits of the earth Knew that the man was dumb from birth. Unto the Sun with deep salaams The Parsee spreads his morning palms (A beacon blazing on a height Warms o'er his piety by night.) The Moslem deprecates the deed, Cuts off the head that holds the creed, Then reverently goes to grass, Muttering thanks to Balaam's Ass For faith and learning to refute Idolatry so dissolute! But should a maniac dash past, With straws in beard and hands upcast, To him (through whom, whene'er inclined To preach a bit to Madmankind, The Holy Prophet speaks his mind) Our True Believer lifts his eyes Devoutly and his prayer applies; But next to Solyman the Great Reveres the idiot's sacred state. Small wonder then, our worthy mute Was held in popular repute. Had he been blind as well as mum, Been lame as well as blind and dumb, No bard that ever sang or soared Could say how he had been adored. More meagerly endowed, he drew An homage less prodigious. True, No soul his praises but did utterâ All plied him with devotion's butter, But none had outâ'twas to their creditâ The proselyting sword to spread it. I state these truths, exactly why The reader knows as well as I; They've nothing in the world to do With what I hope we're coming to If Pegasus be good enough To move when he has stood enough. Egad! his ribs I would examine Had I a sharper spur than famine, Or even with that if 'twould incline To examine his instead of mine. Where was I? Ah, that silent man Who dwelt one time in Ispahan. He had a nameâwas known to all As Meerza Solyman Zingall. There lived afar in Astrabad, A man the world agreed was mad, So wickedly he broke his joke Upon the heads of duller folk, So miserly, from day to day, He gathered up and hid away In vaults obscure and cellars haunted What many worthy people wanted. A stingy man!âthe tradesmen's palms Were spread in vain: âI give no alms Without inquiryââso he'd say, And beat the needy duns away. The bastinado did, 'tis true, Persuade him, now and then, a few Odd tens of thousands to disburse To glut the taxman's hungry purse, But still, so rich he grew, his fear Was constant that the Shah might hear. (The Shah had heard it long ago, And asked the taxman if 'twere so, Who promptly answered, rather airish, The man had long been on the parish.) The more he feared, the more he grew A cynic and a miser, too, Until his bitterness and pelf Made him a terror to himself; Then, with a razor's neckwise stroke, He tartly cut his final joke. So perished, not an hour too soon, The wicked Muley Ben Maroon. From Astrabad to Ispahan At camel-speed the rumor ran That, breaking through tradition hoar, And throwing all his kinsmen o'er, The miser'd left his mighty store Of goldâhis palaces and landsâ To needy and deserving hands (Except a penny here and there To pay the dervishes for prayer.) 'Twas known indeed throughout the span Of earth, and into Hindustan That our beloved mute was the Residuary legatee. The people said 'twas very well, And each man had a tale to tell Of how he'd had a finger in't By dropping many a friendly hint At Astrabad, you see. But ah, They feared the news would reach the Shah! To prove the will, the lawyers bore't Before the Kadi's awful court, Who nodded, when he heard it read, Confirmingly, his drowsy head, Nor thought, his sleepiness so great, Himself to gobble the estate. âI give,â the dead had writ, âmy all To Meerza Solyman Zingall Of Ispahan. With this estate I might quite easily create Ten thousand ingrates, but I shun Temptation and create but one, In whom the whole unthankful crew The rich man's air that ever drew To fat their pauper lungs I fire With vain vicarious desire! From foul Ingratitude's base rout I pick this hapless devil out, Bestowing on him all my lands, My treasures, camels, slaves and bands Of wivesâI give him all this loot, And throw my blessing in to boot. Behold, all men, in this bequest Philanthropy's long wrongs redressed: To speak me ill that man I dower With fiercest will who lacks the power. Allah il Allah! now let him bloat With rancor till his heart's afloat, Unable to discharge the wave Upon his benefactor's grave!â Forth in their wrath the people came And swore it was a sin and shame To trick their blessed mute; and each Protested, serious of speech, That though he'd long foreseen the worst He'd been against it from the first. By many means they vainly tried The testament to set aside, Each ready with his empty purse To take upon himself the curse; For they had powers of invective Enough to make it ineffective. The ingrates mustered, every man, And marched in force to Ispahan (Which had not quite accommodation) And held a camp of indignation. The man, this while, who never spokeâ On whom had fallen this thunder-stroke Of fortune, gave no feeling vent, Nor dropped a hint of his intent. Whereas no power to him came His benefactor to defame, Some (such a length had slander gone to) Even whispered that he didn't want to! But none his secret could divine; If suffering he made no sign Until one night as winter neared From all his haunts he disappearedâ Evanished in a doubtful blank Like little crayfish in a bank, Their heads retracting when you find 'em, And pulling in their holes behind 'em. All through the land of Gul, the stout Young Spring is kicking Winter out. The grass sneaks in upon the scene, Defacing it with bottle-green. The stumbling lamb arrives to ply His restless tail in every eye, Eats nasty mint to spoil his meat And make himself unfit to eat. His noisy throat the bulbul tearsâ In every grove blasphemes and swears As the immodest rose displays Her shameless charms a dozen ways. Lo! now, throughout the utmost span Of Ispahanâof Gulistanâ A big new book's displayed in all The shops and cumbers every stall. The price is lowâthe dealers say 'tisâ And the rich are treated to it gratis. Engraven on its foremost page These title-words the eye engage: âThe Life of Muley Ben Maroon, Of AstrabadâRogue, Thief, Buffoon And MiserâLiver by the Sweat Of Better Men: A Lamponette Composed in Rhyme and Written All By Meerza Solyman Zingall!â CORRECTED NEWS 'Twas a maiden lady, the newspapers say, Pious and prim and a bit gone-gray. She slept like an angel, holy and white, Till ten o'clock in the shank o' the night, When men and other wild animals prey, And then she cried in the viewless gloom: âThere's a man in the room, a man in the room!â And this maiden lady, they make it appear, Leapt out of the window, five fathom sheer! Alas, that lying is such a sin When newspaper men need bread and gin And none can be had for less than a lie! For the maiden lady a bit gone-gray Saw the man in the room from across the way, And leapt, not out of the window but inâ Ten fathoms sheer, as I hope to die! MR. FINK'S DEBATING DONKEY Of a person known as Peters I will humbly crave your leave An unusual adventure into narrative to weaveâ Mr. William Perry Peters, of the town of Muscatel, A public educator and an orator as well. Mr. Peters had a weakness which, 'tis painful to relate, Was a strong predisposition to the pleasures of debate. He would foster disputation wheresoever he might be; In polygonal contention none so happy was as he. 'Twas observable, however, that the exercises ran Into monologue by Peters, that rhetorical young man. And she Muscatelian rustics who assisted at the show, By involuntary silence testified their overthrowâ Mr. Peters, all unheedful of their silence and their grief, Still effacing every vestige of erroneous belief. O, he was a sore affliction to all heretics so bold As to entertain opinions that he didn't care to hold. One dayâ'twas in pursuance of a pedagogic plan For the mental elevation of Uncultivated Manâ Mr. Peters, to his pupils, in dismissing them, explained That the Friday evening following (unless, indeed, it rained) Would be signalized by holding in the schoolhouse a debate Free to all who their opinions might desire to ventilate On the question, âWhich is better, as a serviceable gift, Speech or hearing, from barbarity the human mind to lift?â The pupils told their fathers, who, forehanded always, met At the barroom to discuss it every evening, dry or wet. They argued it and argued it and spat upon the stove, And the non-committal barman on their differences throve. And I state it as a maxim in a loosish kind of way: You'll have the more to back your word the less you have to say. Public interest was lively, but one Ebenezer Fink Of the Rancho del Jackrabbit, only seemed to sit and think. On the memorable evening all the men of Muscatel Came to listen to the logic and the eloquence as wellâ All but William Perry Peters, whose attendance there, I fear, Was to wreak his ready rhetoric upon the public ear, And prove (whichever side he took) that hearing wouldn't lift The human mind as ably as the other, greater gift. The judges being chosen and the disputants enrolled, The question he proceeded in extenso to unfold: âResolvedâThe sense of hearing lifts the mind up out of reach Of the fogs of error better than the faculty of speech.â This simple proposition he expounded, word by word, Till they best understood it who least perfectly had heard. Even the judges comprehended what he ventured to explainâ The impact of a spit-ball admonishing in vain. Beginning at a period before Creation's morn, He had reached the bounds of tolerance and Adam yet unborn. As down the early centuries of pre-historic time He tracked important principles and quoted striking rhyme, And Whisky Bill, prosaic soul! proclaiming him a jay, Had risen and like an earthquake, âreeled unheededly away,â And a late lamented cat, when opportunity should serve, Was preparing to embark upon her parabolic curve, A noise arose outsideâthe door was opened with a bang, And old Ebenezer Fink was heard ejaculating âG'lang!â Straight into that assembly gravely marched without a wink An ancient assâthe property it was of Mr. Fink. Its ears depressed and beating time to its infestive tread, Silent through silence, moved amain that stately quadruped! It stopped before the orator, and in the lamplight thrown Upon its tail they saw that member weighted with a stone. Then spake old Ebenezer: âGents, I heern o' this debate On w'ether v'ice or y'ears is best the mind to elevate. Now 'yer's a bird ken throw some light uponto that tough theme: He has 'em both, I'm free to say, oncommonly extreme. He wa'n't invited for to speak, but he will not refuse (If t'other gentleman ken wait) to exposay his views.â Ere merriment or anger o'er amazement could prevail, He cut the string that held the stone on that canary's tail. Freed from the weight, that member made a gesture of delight, Then rose until its rigid length was horizontal quite. With lifted head and level ears along his withers laid, Jack sighed, refilled his lungs and thenâto put it mildlyâbrayed! He brayed until the stones were stirred in circumjacent hills, And sleeping women rose and fled, in divers kinds of frills. 'Tis said that awful bugle-blastâto make the story briefâ Wafted William Perry Peters through the window, like a leaf! Such is the tale. If anything additional occurred 'Tis not set down, though, truly, I remember to have heard That a gentleman named Peters, now residing at Soquel, A considerable distance from the town of Muscatel, Is opposed to education, and to rhetoric, as well. TO MY LAUNDRESS Saponacea, wert thou not so fair I'd curse thee for thy multitude of sinsâ For sending home my clothes all full of pins, A shirt occasionally that's a snare And a delusion, got, the Lord knows where, The Lord knows why, a sock whose outs and ins None know, nor where it ends nor where begins, And fewer cuffs than ought to be my share. But when I mark thy lilies how they grow, And the red roses of thy ripening charms, I bless the lovelight in thy dark eyes dreaming. I'll never pay thee, but I'd gladly go Into the magic circle of thine arms, Supple and fragrant from repeated steaming. FAME One thousand years I slept beneath the sod, My sleep in 1901 beginning, Then, by the action of some scurvy god Who happened then to recollect my sinning, I was revived and given another inning. On breaking from my grave I saw a crowdâ A formless multitude of men and women, Gathered about a ruin. Clamors loud I heard, and curses deep enough to swim in; And, pointing at me, one said: âLet's put him in!â Then each turned on me with an evil look, As in my ragged shroud I stood and shook. âNay, good Posterity,â I cried, âforbear! If that's a jail I fain would be remaining Outside, for truly I should little care To catch my death of cold. I'm just regaining The life lost long ago by my disdaining To take precautions against draughts like those That, haply, penetrate that cracked and splitting Old structure.â Then an aged wight arose From a chair of state in which he had been sitting, And with preliminary coughing, spitting And wheezing, said: â'Tis not a jail, we're sure, Whate'er it may have been when it was newer. â'Twas found two centuries ago, o'ergrown With brush and ivy, all undoored, ungated; And in restoring it we found a stone Set here and there in the dilapidated And crumbling frieze, inscribed, in antiquated Big characters, with certain uncouth names, Which we conclude were borne of old by awful Rapscallions guilty of all sinful gamesâ Vagrants engaged in practices unlawful, And orators less sensible than jawful. So each ten years we add to the long row A name, the most unworthy that we know.â âBut why,â I asked, âput mine in?â He replied. âYou look itââand the judgment pained me greatly; Right gladly would I then and there have died, But that I'd risen from the grave so lately. But on examining that solemn, stately Old ruin I remarked: âMy friends, you errâ The truth of this is just what I expected. This building in its time made quite a stir. I lived (was famous, too) when 'twas erected. The names here first inscribed were much respected. This is the Hall of Fame, or I'm a stork, And this goat-pasture once was called New York.â OMNES VANITAS Alas for ambition's possessor! Alas for the famous and proud! The Isle of Manhattan's best dresser Is wearing a hand-me-down shroud. The world has forgotten his glory; The wagoner sings on his wain, And Chauncey Depew tells a story, And jackasses laugh in the lane. CONSOLATION Little's the good to sit and grieve Because the serpent tempted Eve. Better to wipe your eyes and take A club and go out and kill a snake. But if you prefer, as I suspect, To philosophize, why, then, reflect: If the cunning rascal upon the limb Hadn't tempted her she'd have tempted him. FATE Alas, alas, for the tourist's guide!â He turned from the beaten trail aside, Wandered bewildered, lay down and died. O grim is the Irony of Fate: It switches the man of low estate And loosens the dogs upon the great. It lights the fireman to roast the cook; The fisherman writhes upon the hook, And the flirt is slain with a tender look. The undertaker it overtakes; It saddles the cavalier, and makes The haughtiest butcher into steaks. Assist me, gods, to balk the decree! Nothing I'll do and nothing I'll be, In order that nothing be done to me. PHILOSOPHER BIMM Republicans think Jonas Bimm A Democrat gone mad, And Democrats consider him Republican and bad. The Lout reviles him as a Dude And gives it him right hot; The Dude condemns his crassitude And calls him sans-culottes. Derided as an Anglophile By Anglophobes, forsooth, As Anglophobe he feels, the while, The Anglophilic tooth. The Churchman calls him Atheist; The Atheists, rough-shod, Have ridden o'er him long and hissed: âThe wretch believes in God!â The Saints whom clergymen we call Would kill him if they could; The Sinners (scientists and all) Complain that he is good. All men deplore the difference Between themselves and him, And all devise expedients For paining Jonas Bimm. I too, with wild demoniac glee, Would put out both his eyes; For Mr. Bimm appears to me Insufferably wise! REMINDED Beneath my window twilight made Familiar mysteries of shade. Faint voices from the darkening down Were calling vaguely to the town. Intent upon a low, far gleam That burned upon the world's extreme, I sat, with short reprieve from grief, And turned the volume, leaf by leaf, Wherein a hand long dead had wrought A million miracles of thought. My fingers carelessly unclung The lettered pages, and among Them wandered witless, nor divined The wealth in which, poor fools, they mined. The soul that should have led their quest Was dreaming in the level west, Where a tall tower, stark and still, Uplifted on a distant hill, Stood lone and passionless to claim Its guardian star's returning flame. I know not how my dream was broke, But suddenly my spirit woke Filled with a foolish fear to look Upon the hand that clove the book, Significantly pointing; next I bent attentive to the text, And readâand as I read grew oldâ The mindless words: âPoor Tom's a-cold!â Ah me! to what a subtle touch The brimming cup resigns its clutch Upon the wine. Dear God, is't writ That hearts their overburden bear Of bitterness though thou permit The pranks of Chance, alurk in nooks, And striking coward blows from books, And dead hands reaching everywhere? SALVINI IN AMERICA Come, gentlemenâyour gold. Thanks; welcome to the show, To hear a story told In words you do not know. Now, great Salvini, rise And thunder through your tears! Aha! friends, let your eyes Interpret to your ears. Gods! 'tis a goodly game. Observe his strideâhow grand! When legs like his declaim Who can misunderstand? See how that arm goes round. It says, as plain as day: âI love,â âThe lost is found,â âWell met, sir,â or, âAway!â And mark the drawing down Of brows. How accurate The language of that frown: Pain, gentlemenâor hate. Those of the critic trade Swear it is all as clear As if his tongue were made To fit an English ear. Hear that Italian phrase! Greek to your sense, 'tis true; But shrug, expression, gazeâ Well, they are Grecian too. But it is Art! God wot Art's tongue to all is known. Faith! he to whom 'twere not Would better hold his own. Shakespeare says act and word Should match together true. For what you've seen and heard, How can you doubt they do? Enchanting drama! Mark The crowd âfrom pit to domeâ; One box alone is darkâ The prompter stays at home. Stupendous artist! You Are lord of joy and woe: We thrill if you say âBoo,â And thrill if you say âBo.â ANOTHER WAY I lay in silence, dead. A woman came And laid a rose upon my breast and said: âMay God be merciful.â She spoke my name, And added: âIt is strange to think him dead. âHe loved me well enough, but 'twas his way To speak it lightly.â Then, beneath her breath: âBesidesââI knew what further she would say, But then a footfall broke my dream of death. To-day the words are mine. I lay the rose Upon her breast, and speak her name, and deem It strange indeed that she is dead. God knows I had more pleasure in the other dream. ART For Gladstone's portrait five thousand pounds Were paid, 'tis said, to Sir John Millais. I cannot help thinking that such fine pay Transcended reason's uttermost bounds. For it seems to me uncommonly queer That a painted British statesman's price Exceeds the established value thrice Of a living statesman over here. TO ONE ACROSS THE WAY When at your window radiant you've stood I've sometimes feltâforgive me if I erredâ That some slight thought of me perhaps has stirred Your heart to beat less gently than it should. I know you beautiful; that you are good I hopeâor fearâI cannot choose the word, Nor rightly suit it to the thought. I've heard Reason at love's dictation never could. Blindly to this dilemma so I grope, As one whose every pathway has a snare: If you are minded in the saintly fashion Of your pure face my passion's without hope; If not, alas! I equally despair, For what to me were hope without the passion? TO A DEBTOR ABROAD Grief for an absent lover, husband, friend, Is barely felt before it comes to end: A score of early consolations serve To modify its mouth's dejected curve; But woes of creditors when debtors flee Forever swell the separating sea. When standing on an alien shore you mark The steady course of some intrepid bark, How sweet to think a tear for you abides, Not all unuseful, in the wave she rides!â That sighs for you commingle in the gale Beneficently bellying her sail! GENESIS God said: âLet there be Man,â and from the clay Adam came forth and, thoughtful, walked away. The matrix whence his body was obtained, An empty, man-shaped cavity, remained All unregarded from that early time Till in a recent storm it filled with slime. Now Satan, envying the Master's power To make the meat himself could but devour, Strolled to the place and, standing by the pool, Exerted all his will to make a fool. A miracle!âfrom out that ancient hole Rose Doxey, lacking nothing but a soul. âTo give him that I've not the power divine,â Said Satan, sadly, âbut I'll lend him mine.â He breathed it into him, a vapor black, And to this day has never got it back. LIBERTY ââLet there be Liberty!â God said, and lo! The skies were red and luminous. The glow Struck first Columbia's kindling mountain peaks One hundred and eleven years ago!â So sang a patriot whom once I saw Descending Bunker's holy hill. With awe I noted that he shone with sacred light, Like Moses with the tables of the Law. One hundred and eleven years? O small And paltry period compared with all The tide of centuries that flowed and ebbed To etch Yosemite's divided wall! Ah, Liberty, they sing you always young Whose harps are in your adoration strung. (Each swears you are his countrywoman, too, And speak no language but his mother tongue.) And truly, lass, although with shout and horn Man has all-hailed you from creation's morn I cannot think you oldâI think, indeed, You are by twenty centuries unborn. THE PASSING OF SHEPHERD The sullen church-bell's intermittent moan, The dirge's melancholy monotone, The measured march, the drooping flags, attest A great man's progress to his place of rest. Along broad avenues himself decreed To serve his fellow men's disputed needâ Past parks he raped away from robbers' thrift And gave to poverty, wherein to lift Its voice to curse the giver and the giftâ Past noble structures that he reared for men To meet in and revile him, tongue and pen, Draws the long retinue of death to show The fit credentials of a proper woe. âBossâ Shepherd, you are dead. Your hand no more Throws largess to the mobs that ramp and roar For blood of benefactors who disdain Their purity of purpose to explain, Their righteous motive and their scorn of gain. Your period of dreamâ'twas but a breathâ Is closed in the indifference of death. Sealed in your silences, to you alike If hands are lifted to applaud or strike, No more to your dull, inattentive ear Praise of to-day than curse of yesteryear. From the same lips the honied phrases fall That still are bitter from cascades of gall. We note the shame; you in your depth of dark The red-writ testimony cannot mark On every honest cheek; your senses all Locked, incomunicado, in your pall, Know not who sit and blush, who stand and bawl. âSeven Grecian cities claim great Homer dead, Through which the living Homer begged his bread.â âNeglected genius!ââthat is sad indeed, But malice better would ignore than heed, And Shepherd's soul, we rightly may suspect, Prayed often for the mercy of neglect When hardly did he dare to leave his door Without a guard behind him and before To save him from the gentlemen that now In cheap and easy reparation bow Heads hypocritical above his corse To counterfeit a grief that's half remorse. The pageant passes and the exile sleeps, And well his silent tongue the secret keeps Of the great peace he found afar, until, Death's writ of extradition to fulfill, They brought him helpless, from that friendly zone To be a show and pastime in his ownâ A final opportunity to those Who fling with equal aim the stone and rose; That at the living till his soul is freed, This at the body to conceal the deed! Lone on his hill he's lying to await What added honors may befit his stateâ The monument, the statue, or the arch (Where knaves may come to weep and dupes to march) Builded by clowns to brutalize the scenes His genius beautified. To get the means, His newly good traducers all are dunned For contributions to the conscience fund. If each subscribe (and pay) one cent 'twill rear A structure taller than their tallest ear. 1903. TO MAUDE Not as two errant spheres together grind With monstrous ruin in the vast of space, Destruction born of that malign embrace, Their hapless peoples all to death consignedâ Not so when our intangible worlds of mind, Even mine and yours, each with its spirit race, Of beings shadowy in form and face, Shall drift together on some blessed wind. No, in that marriage of gloom and light All miracles of beauty shall be wrought, Attesting a diviner faith than man's; For all my sad-eyed daughters of the night Shall smile on your sweet seraphim of thought, Nor any jealous god forbid the banns. THE BIRTH OF VIRTUE When, long ago, the young world circling flew Through wider reaches of a richer blue, New-eyed, the men and maids saw, manifest, The thoughts untold in one another's breastâ Each wish displayed, and every passion learned; A look revealed them as a look discerned. But sating Time with clouds o'ercast their eyes; Desire was hidden, and the lips framed lies. A goddess then, emerging from the dust, Fair Virtue rose, the daughter of Distrust. THE SCURRIL PRESS Tom Jonesmith (loquitur): I've slept right through The nightâa rather clever thing to do. How soundly women sleep [looks at his wife]. They're all alike. The sweetest thing in life Is woman when she lies with folded tongue, Its toil completed and its day-song sung. [Thump!] That's the morning paper. What a bore That it should be delivered at the door. There ought to be some expeditious way To get it to one. By this long delay The fizz gets off the news [a rap is heard]. That's Jane, the housemaid; she's an early bird; She's brought it to the bedroom door, good soul. [Gets up and takes it in.] Upon the whole, The system's not so bad a one. What's here? Gad! if they've not got afterâlisten, dear, [To sleeping wife]âyoung Gastrotheos. Well, If Freedom shrieked when Kosciusko fell She'll shriek againâwith laughterâseeing how They treated Gast. with her. Yet I'll allow 'Tis right if he goes dining at The Pup With Mrs. Thing. Wife [briskly, waking up]: With her? The hussy! Yes, it serves him right. Jonesmith [continuing to âseek the lightâ]: What's this about old Impycu? That's good! Gripâthat's the funny manâsays Impy should Be used as a decoy in shooting tramps. I knew old Impy when he had the âstampsâ To buy us all out, and he wasn't then So bad a chap to have about. Grip's pen Is just a tickler!âand the world, no doubt, Is better with it than it was without. What? thirteen ladiesâJumping Jove! we know Them nearly all!âwho gamble at a low And very shocking game of cards called âdrawâ! O cracky, how they'll squirm! ha-ha! haw-haw! Let's see what else [wife snores]. Well, I'll be blest! A woman doesn't understand a jest. Hello! What, what? the scurvy wretch proceeds To take a fling at me, condemn him! [reads]: Tom Jonesmithâmy name's Thomas, vulgar cad!â Of the new Shavings Bankâthe man's gone mad! That's libelous; I'll have him up for thatâ Has had his corns cut. Devil take the rat! What business is't of his, I'd like to know? He didn't have to cut them. Gods! what low And scurril things our papers have become! You skim their contents and you get but scum. Here, Mary [waking wife] I've been attacked In this vile sheet. By Jove, it is a fact! Wife [reading it]: How wicked! Who do you Suppose 'twas wrote it? Jonesmith: Who? why, who But Grip, the so-called funny-manâhe wrote Me up because I'd not discount his note. [Blushes like sunset at the hideous lieâ He'll think of one that's better by and by; Throws down the paper on the floor, and treads A merry measure on it; kicks the shreds And patches all about the room, and still Performs his jig with unabated will.] Wife [warbling sweetly, like an Elfland horn]: Dear, do be careful of that second corn. STANLEY Noting some great man s composition vile: A head of wisdom and a heart of guile, A will to conquer and a soul to dare, Joined to the manners of a dancing bear, Fools unaccustomed to the wide survey Of various Nature's compensating sway; Untaught to separate the wheat and chaff, To praise the one and at the other laugh; Yearn all in vain and impotently seek Some flawless hero upon whom to wreak The sycophantic worship of the weak. Not so the wise, from superstition free, Who find small pleasure in the supple knee; Quick to discriminate 'twixt good and bad, And willing in the king to find the cadâ No reason seen why genius and deceit, The power to dazzle and the will to cheat, The love of daring and the love of gin, Should not dwell, peaceful, in a single skin. To such, great Stanley, you're a hero still, Despite your cradling in a tub for swill. Your peasant manners can't efface the mark Of light you drew across the Land of Dark. In you the extremes of character are wed, To serve the quick and vilify the dead. Hero and clown! O, man of many sides, The Muse of Truth adores you and derides, And sheds, impartial, the revealing ray Upon your head of gold and feet of clay. ONE OF THE UNFAIR SEX She stood at the ticket-seller's Serenely removing her glove, While hundreds of strugglers and yellers, And some that were good at a shove, Were clustered behind her like bats in a cave and dissembling their love. At night she still stood at that window Endeavoring her money to reach; The crowds in her rear, how they sinnedâO, How dreadfully sinned in their speech! Ten miles and a fraction extended their line, the historians teach. She stands there to-dayâlegislation Has failed to remove her. The trains No longer pull up at that station; And over the ghastly remains Of the army that waited and died of old age fall the snows and the rains. THE LORD'S PRAYER ON A COIN Upon this quarter-eagle's leveled face, The Lord's Prayer, legibly inscribed, I trace. âOur Father whichââthe pronoun there is funny, And shows the scribe to have addressed the moneyâ âWhich art in Heavenââan error this, no doubt: The preposition should be stricken out. Needless to quote; I only have designed To praise the frankness of the pious mind Which thought it natural and right to join, With rare significancy, prayer and coin. AD ABSURDUM Congressman Rixey, you're a statesmanâyou Yourself will hardly say that you are not; And yet I know not what you hope to do For those Confederates whose luckless lot Is to have lived through storms of Yankee shot To this our day. They draw their breath, indeed, But from the Government no cent of what So admirably serves your nobler need. You work for it? Why, that all cavilers concede. You'd call these ârebelsâ to the Soldiers' Homes On equal terms with persons whom they fought! Whereat the âtruly loyalâ statesman foams At the loud mouth of him. But that is naughtâ He foams, not for he must, but for he ought: For the Poll-patriot's emotions flow By taking (with much else of value) thought. His feelings, if he have them, never blow His cooling coal of anger to a brighter glow. Well, well, sir, even the Devil may be right Through ignorance or accident. 'Tis said We're sometimes dazzled with too great a light, In which the blind, with customary tread (And by a small, unblinking puppy led) Walk prosperous courses to appointed goals. And so your critics, though without a head Among themâeyeless, therefore, as the molesâ May wiser be than you, who damn their little souls! If of two aged Southern gentlemen Of equal need and worth, the one that tried To cook the country's gooseâor say its henâ Be blest with all the cheer we can provide, And which to t'other sternly is denied Because he didn't, it will seem right queer. The gods are logical and may deride. Respect the Southern veteran, but fear The laughter of Olympus sounding loud and clear! SAITH THE CZAR My people come to me and make their moan: âWe starve, your Majestyâgive us a stone.â That's flat rebellion!âhow the devil dare They starve right in my capital? Their prayer For something in their bellies I will meet With that which I'll not trouble them to eat. They ask for greater freedom. No, indeedâ What happened to my ancestor who freed The serfs? His grateful subjects duly flung Something that spoke to him without a tongue. So he was sacrificed for Freedom's sake, And gathered to his fathers with a rake. I from Autocracy my people free? Ah, would to Heaven they could deliver me! THE ROYAL JESTER Once on a time, so ancient poets sing, There reigned in Godknowswhere a certain king. So great a monarch ne'er before was seen: He was a hero, even to his queen, In whose respect he held so high a place That none had higher,ânay, not even the ace. He was so just his parliament declared Those subjects happy whom his laws had spared; So wise that none of the debating throng Had ever lived to prove him in the wrong; So good that Crime his anger never feared, And Beauty boldly plucked him by the beard; So brave that if his army got a beating None dared to face him when he was retreating. This monarch kept a fool to make his mirth, And loved him tenderly despite his worth. Prompted by what caprice I cannot say, He called the Fool before the throne one day And to that minion seriously said: âI'll abdicate, and you shall reign instead, While I, attired in motley, will make sport To entertain your Majesty and Court.â 'Twas done and the Fool governed. He decreed The time of harvest and the time of seed; Ordered the rains and made the weather clear, And had a famine every second year; Altered the calendar to suit his freak, Ordaining six whole holidays a week; Religious creeds and sacred books prepared; Made war when angry and made peace when scared. New taxes he imposed; new laws he made; Drowned those who broke them, who observed them, flayed. In short, he ruled so well that all who'd not Been starved, decapitated, hanged or shot Made the whole country with his praises ring, Declaring he was every inch a king; And the High Priest averred 'twas very odd If one so competent were not a god. Meantime, his master, now in motley clad, Wore such a visage, woful, wan and sad, That some condoled with him as with a brother Who, having lost a wife, had got another. Others, mistaking his profession, often Approached him to be measured for a coffin. For years this highborn Jester never broke The silenceâhe was pondering a joke. At last, one day, in cap and bells arrayed, He strode into the Council and displayed A long bright smile, that glittered in the gloom Like a gilt epitaph within a tomb. Poising his bauble like a leader's staff, To give the signal when (and why) to laugh, He brought it down with peremptory stroke And simultaneously cracked his joke! I can't repeat it, friends. I ne'er could school Myself to quote from any other fool: A jest, if it were worse than mine, would start My tears; if better, it would break my heart. So, if you please, I'll hold you but to state That royal Jester's melancholy fate. The insulted nation, so the story goes, Rose as one manâthe very dead arose, Springing indignant from the riven tomb, And babes unborn leapt swearing from the womb! All to the Council Chamber clamoring went, By rage distracted and on vengeance bent. In that vast hall, in due disorder laid, The tools of legislation were displayed, And the wild populace, its wrath to sate, Seized them and heaved them at the Jester's pate. Mountains of writing paper; pools and seas Of ink awaiting, to become decrees, Royal approvalâand the same in stacks Lay ready for attachment, backed with wax; Pens to make laws, erasers to amend them, With mucilage convenient to extend them; Scissors for limiting their application, Trash-baskets to repeal all legislationâ These, flung as missiles till the air was dense, Were most offensive weapons of offense, And by their aid the man was nigh destroyed. They ne'er had been so harmlessly employed. Whelmed underneath a load of legal cap, His mouth egurgitating ink on tap, His eyelids mucilaginously sealed, His fertile head by scissors made to yield Abundant harvestage of ears, his pelt, In every wrinkle and on every welt, Quickset with pencil-points from feet to gills And thickly studded with a pride of quills, The royal Jester in the dreadful strife Was made (in short) an editor for life! An idle tale, and yet a moral lurks In this as plainly as in greater works. I shall not give it birth: one moral here Would die of loneliness within a year. A CAREER IN LETTERS When Liberverm resigned the chair Of This or That in college, where Two decades he had gorged his brain With more than it could well contain, In order to relieve the stress He took to writing for the press. Then Pondronummus said: âI'll help This mine of talent to devel'p:â And straightway bought with coin and credit The Thundergust for him to edit. The great man seized the pen and ink And wrote so hard he couldn't think. Ideas grew beneath his fist And flew like falcons from his wrist. His pen shot sparks all kinds of ways Till all the rivers were ablaze, And where the coruscations fell Men uttered words I dare not spell. Eftsoons with corrugated brow, Wet towels bound about his pow, Locked legs and failing appetite, He thought so hard he couldn't write. His soaring fancies, chickenwise, Came home to roost and wouldn't rise. With dimmer light and milder heat His goose-quill staggered o'er the sheet, Then dragged, then stopped; the finish cameâ He couldn't even write his name. The Thundergust in three short weeks Had risen, roared, and split its cheeks. Said Pondronummus, âHow unjust! The storm I raised has laid my dust!â When, Moneybagger, you have aught Invested in a vein of thought, Be sure you've purchased not, instead, That salted claim, a bookworm's head. THE FOLLOWING PAIR O very remarkable mortal, What food is engaging your jaws And staining with amber their portal? âIt's 'baccy I chaws.â And why do you sway in your walking, To right and left many degrees, And hitch up your trousers when talking? âI follers the seas.â Great indolent shark in the rollers, Is â'baccy,â too, one of your faults?â You, too, display maculate molars. âI dines upon salts.â Strange diet!âintestinal pain it Is commonly given to nip. And how can you ever obtain it? âI follers the ship.â POLITICAL ECONOMY âI beg you to note,â said a Man to a Goose, As he plucked from her bosom the plumage all loose, âThat pillows and cushions of feathers, and beds As warm as maids' hearts and as soft as their heads, Increase of life's comforts the general sumâ Which raises the standard of living.â âCome, come,â The Goose said impatiently, âtell me or cease, How that is of any advantage to geese.â âWhat, what!â said the manââyou are very obtuse! Consumption no profit to those who produce? No good to accrue to Supply from a grand Progressive expansion, all around, of Demand? Luxurious habits no benefit bring To those who purvey the luxurious thing? Consider, I pray you, my friend, how the growth Of luxury promisesââ âPromises,â quoth The sufferer, âwhat?âto what course is it pledged To pay me for being so often defledged?â âAccustomedââthis notion the plucker expressed As he ripped out a handful of down from her breastâ âTo one kind of luxury, people soon yearn For others and ever for others in turn. The man who to-night on your feathers will rest, His mutton or bacon or beef to digest, His hunger to-morrow will wish to assuage With goose and a dressing of onions and sage.â THE UNPARDONABLE SIN I reckon that ye never knew, That dandy slugger, Tom Carew. He had a touch as light an' free As that of any honey-bee; But where it lit there wasn't much To jestify another touch. O, what a Sunday-school it was To watch him puttin' up his paws An' roominate upon their heftâ Particular his holy left! Tom was my styleâthat's all I say; Some others may be equal gay. What's come of him? Dunno, I'm sure; He's deadâwhich makes his fate obscure. I only started in to clear One vital p'int in his career, Which is to sayâafore he died He soiled his erming mighty snide. Ye see he took to politics And learnt them statesmen-fellers' tricks; Pulled wires, wore stovepipe hats, used scent, Just like he was the President; Went to the Legislater; spoke Right out agin the British yokeâ But that was right. He let his hair Grow long to qualify for Mayor, An' once or twice he poked his snoot In Congress like a low galoot! It had to comeâno gent can hope To wrastle God agin the rope. Tom went from bad to wuss. Being dead, I s'pose it oughtn't to be said, For sech inikities as flow From politics ain't fit to know. But, if you think it's actin' white To tell itâThomas throwed a fight! INDUSTRIAL DISCONTENT As time rolled on the whole world came to be A desolation and a darksome curse; And some one said: âThe changes that you see In the fair frame of things, from bad to worse, Are wrought by strikes. The sun withdrew his glimmer Because the moon assisted with her shimmer. âThen, when poor Luna, straining very hard, Doubled her light to serve a darkling world, He called her âscab,â and meanly would retard Her rising: and at last the villain hurled A heavy beam which knocked her o'er the Lion Into the nebula of great O'Ryan. âThe planets all had struck some time before, Demanding what they said were equal rights: Some pointing out that others had far more Than a fair dividend of satellites. So all went outâbut those the best provided, If they had dared would rather have abided. âThe stars struck tooâI think it was because The comets had more liberty than they, And were not bound by any hampering laws, While they were fixed; and there are those who say The comets' tresses nettled poor Antares, A bald old orb, whose disposition varies. âThe earth's the only one that isn't in The movementâI suppose because she's watched With horror and disgust how her fair skin Her pranking parasites have fouled and blotched With blood and grease in every labor riot, When seeing any purse or throat to fly at.â TEMPORA MUTANTUR âThe world is dull,â I cried in my despair: âIts myths and fables are no longer fair. âRoll back thy centuries, O Father Time: To Greece transport me in her golden prime. âGive back the beautiful old gods againâ The sportive Nymphs, the Dryad's jocund train, âPan piping on his reeds, the Naiades, The Sirens singing by the sleepy seas. âNay, show me but a Gorgon and I'll dare To lift mine eyes to her peculiar hair â(The fatal horrors of her snaky pate, That stiffen men into a stony state) âAnd dieâbecoming, as my spirit flies, A noble statue of myself, life size.â Straight as I spoke I heard the voice of Fate: âLook up, my lad, the Gorgon sisters wait.â Lifting my eyes, I saw Medusa stand, Stheno, Euryale, on either hand. I gazed unpetrified and unappalledâ The girls had aged and were entirely bald! A FALSE ALARM When Gertrude Atherton pronounced the ladies Of fair Manhattan hideous as Hadesâ In eyes no splendor, and in cheeks no roses, And, O ye godlings! rudimentary nosesâ To pass a bad half-hour before their glasses, Straight to their dressing-rooms ran dames and lasses, Who, still dissenting from her curst appraisal, Grew more pugnacious, but not less pugnasal. Ladies, be calm: there's nothing to distress youâ The Sacred Englishman will rise and bless you. No nosesânone to speak ofâis alarming, But that you can't speak through themâthat is charming! CONTENTMENT Sleep fell upon my senses and I dreamed Long years had circled since my life had fled. The world was different, and all things seemed Remote and strange, like noises to the dead. And one great Voice there was; and some one said: âPosterity is speakingârightly deemed Infallibleâ; and so I gave attention, Hoping Posterity my name would mention. âIllustrious Spirit,â said the Voice, âappear! While we confirm eternally thy fame, Before our dread tribunal answer, here, Why do no statues celebrate thy name, No monuments thy services proclaim? Why did not thy contemporaries rear To thee some schoolhouse or memorial college? It looks almighty queer, you must acknowledge.â Up spake I hotly: âThat is where you err!â But some one thundered in my ear: âYou shan't Be interrupting these proceedings, sir; The question was addressed to General Grant.â Some other things were spoken which I can't Distinctly now recall, but I infer, By certain flushings of my cheek and forehead, Posterity's environment is torrid. Then heard I (this was in a dream, remark) Another Voice, clear, comfortable, strong, As Grant's great shade, replying from the dark, Said in a tone that rang the earth along, And thrilled the senses of the judges' throng: âI'd rather you would question why, in park And street, my monuments were not erected Than why they were.â Then, waking, I reflected. 1885. CONSTANCY I had a dream. A throng of people sped Hard after something that before them fledâ A ball that leapt and bounded. I pursued, Kicking, like all the rest, at Bryan's head. Ah, God, it was indeed a ghastly play! That noble headâits locks in disarray Streaming like feathers of a shuttlecockâ Urged with resounding buffets on its way. Ever the foremost in the chase accurst Ran Two who in his life, too, had been first Among his followers. âBehold,â I cried, âThose twins of constancy, the Devil and Hearst!â Smitten in spirit with a sudden shame, And from intemperate exertion lame, I sprang, and skyward with a parting kick Hoisted that mellow bulb, and left the game. THE NEW ENOCH ARDEN Enoch Arden was an able Seaman; hear of his mishapâ Not in wild mendacious fable, As 'twas told by t'other chap; For I hold it is a youthful Indiscretion to tell lies, And the writer that is truthful Has the reader that is wise. Enoch Arden, able seaman, On an isle was cast away, And before he was a free man Time had touched him up with gray. Long he searched the far horizon, Seated on a mountain top; Vessel ne'er he set his eyes on That would undertake to stop. Seeing that his sight was growing Dim and dimmer day by day, Enoch said he must be going. So he rose and went awayâ Went away and so continued Till he lost his lonely isle: Mr. Arden was so sinewed He could row for many a mile. Compass he had not, nor sextant, To direct him o'er the sea: Ere 'twas known that he was extant, At his boyhood's home was he. When he saw the hills and hollows And the streets he could but know, He gave utterance as follows To the sentiments below: âBlast my tarry toplights! (shiver, Too, my timbers) but, I say, W'at a larruk to diskiver That I've lost my blessed way! âW'at, alas, would be my bloomin' Fate if Philip now I see, Which I lammed?âor my old 'oman, Which has frequent basted me?â All the landscape swam around him At the thought of such a lot: In a swoon his Annie found him And conveyed him to her cot. 'Twas the very house, the garden, Where their honeymoon was passed: 'Twas the place where Mrs. Arden Would have mourned him to the last. Ah, what grief she'd known without him! Now what tears of joy she shed! Enoch Arden looked about him: âShanghaied!ââthat was all he said. DISAVOWAL Two bodies are lying in PhÅnix Park, Grim and bloody and stiff and stark, And a Land League man with averted eye Crosses himself as he hurries by. And he says to his conscience under his breath: âI have had no hand in this deed of death.â A Fenian, making a circuit wide And passing them by on the other side, Shudders and crosses himself and cries: âWho says that I did it, he lies, he lies!â Gingerly stepping across the gore, Pat Satan comes after the two before, Makes, in a solemnly comical way, The sign of the cross and is heard to say: âO dear, what a terrible sight to see, For babes like them and a saint like me!â 1882. AN AVERAGE I ne'er could be entirely fond Of any maiden who's a blonde, And no brunette that e'er I saw My whole devotion e'er could draw. Yet sure no girl was ever made Just half of light and half of shade. And so, this happy mean to get, I love a blonde and a brunette. INCURABLE From pride, guile, hate, greed, melancholyâ From any kind of vice, or folly, Bias, propensity or passion That is in prevalence and fashion, Save one, the sufferer or lover May, by the grace of God, recover. Alone that spiritual tetter, The zeal to make creation better, Glows still immedicably warmer. Who knows of a reformed reformer? THE PUN Hail, peerless Pun! thou last and best, Most rare and excellent bequest Of dying idiot to the wit He died of, rat-like, in a pit! Thyself disguised, in many a way, Thou let'st thy sudden splendor play, Adorning all where'er it turns, As the revealing bull's-eye burns For the dim thief, and plays its trick Upon the lock he means to pick. Yet sometimes, too, thou dost appear As boldly as a brigadier Tricked out with marks and signs all o'er Of rank, brigade, division, corps, To show by every means he can An officer is not a man; Or naked, with a lordly swagger, Proud as a cur without a wagger, Who says: âSee simple worth prevailâ All dog, sirânot a bit of tail!â 'Tis then men give thee loudest welcome, As if thou wert a soul from Hell come. O obvious Pun! thou hast the grace Of skeleton clock without a caseâ With its whole boweling displayed, And all its organs on parade. Dear Pun, thou'rt common ground of bliss, Where Punch and I can meet and kiss; Than thee my wit can stoop no lowerâ No higher his does ever soar. TO NANINE Dear, if I never saw your face again; If all the music of your voice were mute As that of a forlorn and broken lute; If only in my dreams I might attain The benediction of your touch, how vain Were Faith to justify the old pursuit Of happiness, or Reason to confute The pessimist philosophy of pain. Yet Love not altogether is unwise, For still the wind would murmur in the corn, And still the sun would splendor all the mere; And IâI could not, dearest, choose but hear Your voice upon the breeze and see your eyes Shine in the glory of the summer morn. VICE VERSA Down in the state of Maine, the story goes, A woman, to secure a lapsing pension, Married a soldierâthough the good Lord knows That very common act scarce takes attention. What makes it worthy to be writ and readâ The man she married had been nine hours dead! Now, marrying a corpse is not an act Familiar to our daily observation, And so I crave her pardon if the fact Suggests this interesting speculation: Should some mischance restore the man to life Would she be then a widow, or a wife? Let casuists contest the point; I'm not Disposed to grapple with so great a matter. 'Twould tie my thinker in a double knot And drive me staring mad as any hatterâ Though I submit that hatters are, in fact, Sane, and all other human beings cracked. Small thought have I of Destiny or Chance; Luck seems to me the same thing as Intention; In metaphysics I could ne'er advance, And think it of the Devil's own invention. Enough of joy to know: Though when I wed I must be married, yet I may be dead. A BLACKLIST âResolved that we will post,â the tradesmen say, âAll names of debtors who do never pay.â âWhose shall be first?â inquires the ready scribeâ âWho are the chiefs of the marauding tribe?â Lo! high Parnassus, lifting from the plain, Upon his hoary peak, a noble fane! Within that temple all the names are scrolled Of village bards, upon a slab of gold; To that bad eminence, my friend, aspire, And copy thou the Roll of Fame, entire. Yet not to total shame those names devote, But add in mercy this explaining note: âThese cheat because the law makes theft a crime, And they obey all laws but laws of rhyme.â AUTHORITY âAuthority, authority!â they shout Whose minds, not large enough to hold a doubt, Some chance opinion ever entertain, By dogma billeted upon their brain. âHa!â they exclaim with choreatic glee, âHere's Dabster if you won't give in to meâ Dabster, sir, Dabster, to whom all men look With reverence!â The fellow wrote a book. It matters not that many another wight Has thought more deeply, could more wisely write On t'other sideâthat you yourself possess Knowledge where Dabster did not badly guess. God help you if ambitious to persuade The fools who take opinions ready-made And ârecognize authorities.â Be sure No title of their folly they'll abjure For all that you can say. But write it down, Publish and die and get a great renownâ Faith! how they'll snap it up, misread, misquote, Swear that they had a hand in all you wrote, And ride your fame like monkeys on a goat! THE PSORIAD The King of Scotland, years and years ago, Convened his courtiers in a gallant row And thus addressed them: âGentle sirs, from you Abundant counsel I have had, and true: What laws to make to serve the public weal; What laws of Nature's making to repeal; What old religion is the only true one, And what the greater merit of some new one; What friends of yours my favor have forgot; Which of your enemies against me plot. In harvests ample to augment my treasures, Behold the fruits of your sagacious measures! The punctual planets, to their periods just, Attest your wisdom and approve my trust. Lo! the reward your faith and wisdom bring: The grateful placemen bless their useful king! But while you quaff the nectar of my favor I mean somewhat to modify its flavor By just infusing a peculiar dash Of tonic bitter in the calabash. And should you, too abstemious, disdain it, Egad! I'll hold your noses till you drain it! âYou know, you dogs, your master long has felt A keen distemper in the royal peltâ A testy, superficial irritation, Brought home, I fancy, from some foreign nation. For this a thousand simples you've prescribedâ Unguents external, draughts to be imbibed. You've plundered Scotland of its plants, the seas You've ravished, and despoiled the Hebrides To brew me remedies which, in probation, Were sovereign only in their application. In vain, and eke in pain, have I applied Your flattering unctions to my soul and hide: Physic and hope have been my daily foodâ I've swallowed treacle by the holy rood! âYour wisdom which sufficed to guide the year And tame the seasons in their mad career, When set to higher purposes has failed me And added anguish to the ills that ailed me. Nor that alone, but each ambitious leech His rivals' skill has labored to impeach By hints equivocal in secret speech. For years, to conquer our respective broils, We've plied each other with pacific oils In vain: your turbulence is unallayed, My flame unquenched; your quarreling unstayed; My life so wretched from your strife to save it That death were welcome did I dare to brave it. With zeal inspired by your intemperate pranks, My subjects muster in contending ranks. Those fling their banners to the startled breeze To champion some royal ointment; these The standard of a royal purge display And 'neath that ensign wage a wasteful fray! Brave tongues are thundering from sea to sea, Torrents of sweat roll reeking o'er the lea! My people perish in their martial fear, And rival bagpipes cleave the royal ear! âNow, caitiffs, tremble, for this very hour Your injured sovereign shall assert his power! Behold this lotion, carefully compound Of all the poisons you for me have foundâ Of biting washes such as tan the skin, And drastic drinks to vex the parts within. What aggravates an ailment will produceâ I mean to rub you with this dreadful juice! Divided counsels you no more shall hatchâ At last you shall unanimously scratch. Kneel, villains, kneel, and doff your shirtsâGod bless us! They'll seem, when you resume them, robes of Nessus!â The sovereign ceased, and, sealing what he spoke, From Arthur's Seat A famous height overlooking Edinburgh. confirming thunders broke. The conscious culprits, to their fate resigned, Sank to their knees, all piously inclined. This act, from high Ben Lomond where she floats, The thrifty goddess, Caledonia, notes. Glibly as nimble sixpence, down she tilts Headlong, and ravishes away their kilts, Tears off each plaid and all their shirts discloses, Removes each shirt and their broad backs exposes. The king advancedâthen cursing fled amain, Dashing the phial to the stony plain (Where't straight became a fountain brimming o'er, Whence Father Tweed derives his liquid store) For lo! already on each back sans stitch The red sign manual of the Rosy Witch! PEACE When lion and lamb have together lain down Spectators cry out, all in chorus: âThe lamb doesn't shrink nor the lion frownâ A miracle's working before us!â But 'tis patent why Hot-head his wrath holds in, And Faint-heart her terror and loathing; For the one's but an ass in a lion's skin, The other a wolf in sheep's clothing. THANKSGIVING The Superintendent of an Almshouse. A Pauper. Superintendent: So you're unthankfulâyou'll not eat the bird? You sit about the place all day and gird. I understand you'll not attend the ball That's to be given to-night in Pauper Hall. Pauper: Why, that is true, precisely as you've heard: I have no teeth and I will eat no bird. Superintendent: Ah! see how good is Providence. Because Of teeth He has denuded both your jaws The fowl's made tender; you can overcome it By suction; or at leastâwell, you can gum it, Confirming thus the dictum of the preachers That Providence is good to all His creaturesâ Turkeys excepted. Come, ungrateful friend, If our Thanksgiving dinner you'll attend You shall say graceâask God to bless at least The soft and liquid portions of the feast. Pauper: Without those teeth my speech is rather thickâ He'll hardly understand Gum Arabic. No, I'll not dine to-day. As to the ball, 'Tis known to you that I've no legs at all. I had the goutâhereditary; so, As it could not be cornered in my toe They cut my legs off in the fond belief That shortening me would make my anguish brief. Lacking my legs I could not prosecute With any good advantage a pursuit; And so, because my father chose to court Heaven's favor with his ortolans and port (Thanksgiving every day!) the Lord supplied Saws for my legs, an almshouse for my pride And, once a year, a bird for my inside. No, I'll not danceâmy light fantastic toe Took to its heels some twenty years ago. Some small repairs would be required for putting My body on a saltatory footing. [Sings:] O the legless man's an unhappy chapâ Tum-hi, tum-hi, tum-he o'haddy. The favors o' fortune fall not in his lapâ Tum-hi, tum-heedle-do hum. The plums of office avoid his plate No matter how much he may stump the Stateâ Tum-hi, ho-heeee. The grass grows never beneath his feet, But he cannot hope to make both ends meetâ Tum-hi. With a gleeless eye and a somber heart, He plays the rÃ´le of his mortal part: Wholly himself he can never be. O, a soleless corporation is he! Tum. Superintendent: The chapel bell is calling, thankless friend, Balls you may not, but church you shall, attend. Some recognition cannot be denied To the great mercy that has turned aside The sword of death from us and let it fall Upon the people's necks in Montreal; That spared our city, steeple, roof and dome, And drowned the Texans out of house and home; Blessed all our continent with peace, to flood The Balkan with a cataclysm of blood. Compared with blessings of so high degree, Your private woes look mighty smallâto me. L'AUDACE Daughter of God! Audacity divineâ Of clowns the terror and of brains the signâ Not thou the inspirer of the rushing fool, Not thine of idiots the vocal drool: Thy bastard sister of the brow of brass, Presumption, actuates the charging ass. Sky-born Audacity! of thee who sings Should strike with freer hand than mine the strings; The notes should mount on pinions true and strong, For thou, the subject, shouldst sustain the song, Till angels lean from Heaven, a breathless throng! Alas! with reeling heads and wavering tails, They (notes, not angels) drop and the hymn fails; The minstrel's tender fingers and his thumbs Are torn to rags upon the lyre he strums. Have done! the lofty thesis makes demand For stronger voices and a harder handâ Night-howling apes to make the notes aspire, And Poet Riley's fist to slug the rebel wire! THE GOD'S VIEW-POINT Cheeta Raibama Chunder Sen, The wisest and the best of men, Betook him to the place where sat With folded feet upon a mat Of precious stones beneath a palm, In sweet and everlasting calm, That ancient and immortal gent, The God of Rational Content. As tranquil and unmoved as Fate, The deity reposed in state, With palm to palm and sole to sole, And beaded breast and beetling jowl, And belly spread upon his thighs, And costly diamonds for eyes. As Chunder Sen approached and knelt To show the reverence he felt; Then beat his head upon the sod To prove his fealty to the god; And then by gestures signified The other sentiments inside; The god's right eye (as Chunder Sen, The wisest and the best of men, Half-fancied) grew by just a thought More narrow than it truly ought. Yet still that prince of devotees, Persistent upon bended knees And elbows bored into the earth, Declared the god's exceeding worth And begged his favor. Then at last, Within that cavernous and vast Thoracic space was heard a sound Like that of water undergroundâ A gurgling note that found a vent At mouth of that Immortal Gent In such a chuckle as no ear Had e'er been privileged to hear! Cheeta Raibama Chunder Sen, The wisest, greatest, best of men, Heard with a natural surprise That mighty midriff improvise. And greater yet the marvel was When from between those massive jaws Fell words to make the views more plain The god was pleased to entertain: âCheeta Raibama Chunder Sen,â So ran the rede in speech of menâ âForemost of mortals in assent To creed of Rational Content, Why come you here to impetrate A blessing on your scurvy pate? Can you not rationally be Content without disturbing me? Can you not take a hintâa winkâ Of what of all this rot I think? Is laughter lost upon you quite, To check you in your pious rite? What! know you not we gods protest That all religion is a jest? You take me seriously?âyou About me make a great ado (When I but wish to be alone) With attitudes supine and prone, With genuflexions and with prayers, And putting on of solemn airs, To draw my mind from the survey Of Rational Content away! Learn once for all, if learn you can, This truth, significant to man: A pious person is by odds The one most hateful to the gods.â Then stretching forth his great right hand, Which shadowed all that sunny land, The deity bestowed a touch Which Chunder Sen not overmuch Enjoyedâa touch divine that made The sufferer hear stars! They played And sang as on Creation's morn When spheric harmony was born. Cheeta Raibama Chunder Sen, The most astonished man of men, Fell straight asleep and when he woke The deity nor moved nor spoke, But sat beneath that ancient palm In sweet and everlasting calm. THE ÃSTHETES The lily cranks, the lily cranks, The loppy, loony lasses! They multiply in rising ranks To execute their solemn pranks, They moon along in masses. Blow, sweet lily, in the shade! O, Sunflower decorate the dado! The maiden ass, the maiden ass, The tall and tailless jenny! In limp attire as green as grass, She stands, a monumental brass, The one of one too many. Blow, sweet lily, in the shade! O, Sunflower decorate the dado! 1883. WITH MINE OWN PETARD Time was the local poets sang their songs Beneath their breath in terror of the thongs I snapped about their shins. Though mild the stroke Bards, like the conies, are âa feeble folk,â Fearing all noises but the one they make Themselvesâat which all other mortals quake. Now from their cracked and disobedient throats, Like rats from sewers scampering, their notes Pour forth to move, whene'er the season serves, If not our legs to dance, at least our nerves; As once a ram's-horn solo maddened all The sober-minded stones of Jerich's wall. A year's exemption from the critic's curse Mends the bard's courage but impairs his verse. Thus poolside frogs, when croaking in the night, Are frayed to silence by a meteor's flight, Or by the sudden plashing of a stone From some adjacent cottage garden thrown, But straight renew the song with double din Whene'er the light goes out or man goes in. Shall I with arms unbraced (my casque unlatched, My falchion pawned, my buckler, too, attached) Resume the cuishes and the broad cuirass, Accomplishing my body all in brass, And arm in battle-royal to oppose A village poet singing through the nose? No, let them rhyme; I fought them once before And stilled their songsâbut, Satan! how they swore!â Cuffed them upon the mouth whene'er their throats They cleared for action with their sweetest notes; Twisted their ears (they'd oft tormented mine) And damned them roundly all along the line; Clubbed the whole crew from the Parnassian slopes, A wreck of broken heads and broken hopes! What gained I so? I feathered every curse Launched at the village bards with lilting verse. The town approved and christened me (to show its High admiration) Chief of Local Poets! RESTORED Dull were the days and sober, The mountains were brown and bare, For the season was sad October And a dirge was in the air. The mated starlings flew over To the isles of the southern sea. She wept for her warrior loverâ Wept and exclaimed: âAh me! âLong years have I mourned my darling In his battle-bed at rest; And it's O, to be a starling, With a mate to share my nest!â The angels pitied her sorrow, Restoring her warrior's life; And he came to her arms on the morrow To claim her and take her to wife. An aged loverâa portly, Bald lover, a trifle too stiff, With manners that would have been courtly, And would have been graceful, ifâ If the angels had only restored him Without the additional years That had passed since the enemy bored him To death with their long, sharp spears. As it was, he bored her, and she rambled Away with her father's young groom, And the old lover smiled as he ambled Contentedly back to the tomb. SIRES AND SONS Wild wanton Luxury lays waste the land With difficulty tilled by Thrift's hard hand! Then dies the State!âand, in its carcass found, The millionaires all maggot-like abound. Alas! was it for this that Warren died, And Arnold sold himself to t'other side, Stark piled at Bennington his British dead, And Gates at Camden, Lee at Monmouth, fled?â For this that Perry did the foeman fleece, And Hull surrender to preserve the peace? Degenerate countrymen, renounce, I pray, The slothful ease, the luxury, the gay And gallant trappings of this idle life, And be more fit for one another's wife. A CHALLENGE A bull imprisoned in a stall Broke boldly the confining wall, And found himself, when out of bounds, Within a washerwoman's grounds. There, hanging on a line to dry, A crimson skirt inflamed his eye. With bellowings that woke the dead, He bent his formidable head, With pointed horns and knurly forehead; Then, planting firm his shoulders horrid, Began, with rage made half insane, To paw the arid earth amain, Flinging the dust upon his flanks In desolating clouds and banks, The while his eyes' uneasy white Betrayed his doubt what foe the bright Red tent concealed, perchance, from sight. The garment, which, all undismayed, Had never paled a single shade, Now found a tongueâa dangling sock, Left carelessly inside the smock: âI must insist, my gracious liege, That you'll be pleased to raise the siege: My colors I will never strike. I know your sexâyou're all alike. Some small experience I've hadâ You're not the first I've driven mad.â TWO SHOWS The showman (blessing in a thousand shapes!) Parades a âSchool of Educated Apes!â Small education's needed, I opine, Or native wit, to make a monkey shine. The brute exhibited has naught to do But ape the larger apes that come to viewâ The hoodlum with his horrible grimace, Long upper lip and furtive, shuffling pace, Significant reminders of the time When hunters, not policemen, made him climb; The lady loafer with her draggling âtrail,â That free translation of an ancient tail; The sand-lot quadrumane in hairy suit, Whose heels are thumbs perverted by the boot; The painted actress throwing down the gage To elder artists of the sylvan stage, Proving that in the time of Noah's flood Two ape-skins held her whole profession's blood; The critic waiting, like a hungry pup, To write the schoolâperhaps to eat itâup, As chance or luck occasion may reveal To earn a dollar or maraud a meal. To view the school of apes these creatures go, Unconscious that themselves are half the show. These, if the simian his course but trim To copy them as they have copied him, Will call him âeducated.â Of a verity There's much to learn by studying posterity. A POET'S HOPE 'Twas a weary-looking mortal, and he wandered near the portal Of the melancholy City of the Discontented Dead. He was pale and worn exceeding and his manner was unheeding, As if it could not matter what he did nor what he said. âSacred stranger,ââI addressed him with a reverence befitting The austere, unintermitting, dread solemnity he wore; 'Tis the custom, too, prevailing in the vicinage when hailing One who possibly may be a person lately âgone beforeââ âSacred stranger, much I ponder on your evident dejection, But my carefulest reflection leaves the riddle still unread. How do you yourself explain your dismal tendency to wander By the melancholy City of the Discontented Dead?â Then that solemn person, pausing in the march that he was making, Roused himself as if awaking, fixed his dull and stony eye On my countenance and slowly, like a priest devout and holy, Chanted in a mournful monotone the following reply: âO my brother, do not fear it; I'm no disembodied spiritâ I am Lampton, the Slang Poet, with a price upon my head. I am watching by this portal for some late lamented mortal To arise in his disquietude and leave his earthy bed. âThen I hope to take possession and pull in the earth above me And, renouncing my profession, ne'er be heard of any more. For there's not a soul to love me and no living thing respects me, Which so painfully affects me that I fain would âgo before.ââ Then I felt a deep compassion for the gentleman's dejection, For privation of affection would refrigerate a frog. So I said: âIf nothing humanâif neither man nor woman Can appreciate the fashion of your merit buy a dog.â THE WOMAN AND THE DEVIL When Man and Woman had been made, All but the disposition, The Devil to the workshop strayed, And somehow gained admission. The Master rested from his work, For this was on a Sunday, The man was snoring like a Turk, Content to wait till Monday. âToo bad!â the Woman cried; âO, why, Does slumber not benumb me? A disposition! Oh, I die To know if 'twill become me!â The Adversary said: âNo doubt 'Twill be extremely fine, ma'am, Though sure 'tis long to be withoutâ I beg to lend you mine, ma'am.â The Devil's disposition when She'd got, of course she wore it, For she'd no disposition then, Nor now has, to restore it. TWO ROGUES Dim, grim, and silent as a ghost, The sentry occupied his post, To all the stirrings of the night Alert of ear and sharp of sight. A sudden somethingâsight or sound, About, above, or underground, He knew not where nor whatâensued, Thrilling the sleeping solitude. The soldier cried: âHalt! Who goes there?â The answer came: âDeathâin the air.â âAdvance, Deathâgive the countersign, Or perish if you cross that line!â To change his tone Death thought it wiseâ Reminded him they'd been allies Against the Russ, the Frank, the Turk, In many a bloody bit of work. âIn short,â said he, âin every weather We've soldiered, you and I, together.â The sentry would not let him pass. âGo back,â he growled, âyou tiresome assâ Go back and rest till the next war, Nor kill by methods all abhor: Miasma, famine, filth and vice, With plagues of locusts, plagues of lice, Foul food, foul water, and foul gases, Rank exhalations from morasses. If you employ such low allies This business you will vulgarize. Renouncing then the field of fame To wallow in a waste of shame, I'll prostitute my strength and lurk About the country doing workâ These hands to labor I'll devote, Nor cut, by Heaven, another throat!â THE PIED PIPER OF BROOKLYN So, Beecher's dead. He was a great soul, tooâ Great as a giant organ is, whose reeds Hold in them all the souls of all the creeds That man has ever taught and never knew. When on this mighty instrument was laid His hand Who fashioned it, our common moan Was suppliant in its thundering. The tone Grew more vivacious when the Devil played. No more those luring harmonies we hear, And lo! already men forget the sound. They turn, retracing all the dubious ground O'er which he'd led them stoutly by the ear. NOT GUILTY âI saw your charms in another's arms,â Said a Grecian swain with his blood a-boil; âAnd he kissed you fair as he held you there, A willing bird in a serpent's coil!â The maid looked up from the cinctured cup Wherein she was crushing the berries red, Pain and surprise in her honest eyesâ âIt was only one o' those gods,â she said. PRESENTIMENT With saintly grace and reverent tread, She walked among the graves with me; Her every foot-fall seemed to be A benediction on the dead. The guardian spirit of the place She seemed, and I some ghost forlorn Surprised in the untimely morn She made with her resplendent face. Moved by some waywardness of will, Three paces from the path apart She stepped and stoodâmy prescient heart Was stricken with a passing chill. The folk-lore of the years agone Remembering, I smiled and thought: âWho shudders suddenly at naught, His grave is being trod upon.â But now I know that it was more Than idle fancy. O, my sweet, I did not think so little feet Could make a buried heart so sore! A STUDY IN GRAY I step from the door with a shiver (This fog is uncommonly cold) And ask myself: What did I give her?â The maiden a trifle gone-old, With the head of gray hair that was gold. Ah, well, I suppose 'twas a dollar, And doubtless the change is correct, Though it's odd that it seems so much smaller Than what I'd a right to expect. But you pay when you dine, I reflect. So I walk up the streetâ'twas a saunter A score of years back, when I strolled From this door; and our talk was all banter Those days when her hair was of gold, And the sea-fog less searching and cold. A score? Why, that isn't so very Much time to have lost from a life. There's reason enough to be merry: I've not fallen down in the strife, But marched with the drum and the fife. If Hope, when she lured me and beckoned, Had pushed at my shoulders instead, And Fame, on whose favors I reckoned, Had laureled the worthiest head, I could hallow the years that are dead. Believe me, I've held my own, mostly Through all of this wild masquerade; But somehow the fog is more ghostly To-night, and the skies are more grayed, Like the locks of the restaurant maid. If ever I'd fainted and faltered I'd fancy this did but appear; But the climate, I'm certain, has alteredâ Grown colder and more austere Than it was in that earlier year. The lights, too, are strangely unsteady That lead from the street to the quay. I think they'll go outâand I'm ready To follow. Out there in the sea The fog-bell is calling to me. FOR MERIT To Parmentier Parisians raise A statue fine and large: He cooked potatoes fifty ways, Nor ever led a charge. âPalmam qui meruitââthe rest You know as well as I; And best of all to him that best Of sayings will apply. Let meaner men the poet's bays Or warrior's medal wear; Who cooks potatoes fifty ways Shall bear the palmâde terre. A BIT OF SCIENCE What! photograph in colors? 'Tis a dream And he who dreams it is not overwise, If colors are vibration they but seem, And have no being. But if Tyndall lies, Why, come, thenâphotograph my lady's eyes. Nay, friend, you can't; the splendor of their blue, As on my own beclouded orbs they rest, To naught but vibratory motion's due, As heart, head, limbs and all I am attest. How could her eyes, at rest themselves, be making In me so uncontrollable a shaking? 1894. THE TABLES TURNED Over the man the street car ran, And the driver did never grin. âO killer of men, pray tell me when Your laughter means to begin. âTen years to a day I've observed you slay, And I never have missed before Your jubilant peals as your crunching wheels Were spattered with human gore. âWhy is it, my boy, that you smother your joy, And why do you make no sign Of the merry mind that is dancing behind A solemner face than mine?â The driver replied: âI would laugh till I cried If I had bisected you; But I'd like to explain, if I can for the pain, 'Tis myself that I've cut in two.â TO A DEJECTED POET Thy gift, if that it be of God, Thou hast no warrant to appraise, Nor say: âHere part, O Muse, our ways, The road too stony to be trod.â Not thine to call the labor hard And the reward inadequate. Who haggles o'er his hire with Fate Is better bargainer than bard. What! count the effort labor lost When thy good angel holds the reed? It were a sorry thing indeed To stay him till thy palm be crossed. âThe laborer is worthyâânay, The sacred ministry of song Is rapture!â'twere a grievous wrong To fix a wages-rate for play. THE HUMORIST âWhat is that, mother?â âThe humorist, child. His hands are black, but his heart is mild.â âMay I touch him, mother?â â'Twere needlessly done: He is slightly touched already, my son.â âO, why does he wear such a ghastly grin?â â'Tis the outward sign of a joke within.â âWill he crack it, mother?â âNot so, my saint; 'Tis meant for the Saturday Livercomplaint.â âDoes he suffer, mother?â âGod help him, yes!â A thousand and fifty kinds of distress.â âWhat makes him sweat so?â âThe demons that lurk In the fear of having to go to work.â âWhy doesn't he end, then, his life with a rope?â âAbolition of Hell has deprived him of hope.â MONTEFIORE I sawâ'twas in a dream the other nightâ A man whose hair with age was thin and white: One hundred years had bettered by his birth, And still his step was firm, his eye was bright. Before him and about him pressed a crowd. Each head in reverence was bared and bowed, And Jews and Gentiles in a hundred tongues Extolled his deeds and spoke his fame aloud. I joined the throng and, pushing forward, cried, âMontefiore!â with the rest, and vied In efforts to caress the hand that ne'er To want and worth had charity denied. So closely round him swarmed our shouting clan He scarce could breathe, and taking from a pan A gleaming coin, he tossed it o'er our heads, And in a moment was a lonely man! DISCRETION She: I'm told that men have sometimes got Too confidential, and Have said to one another what Theyâwell, you understand. I hope I don't offend you, sweet, But are you sure that you're discreet? He: 'Tis true, sometimes my friends in wine Their conquests do recall, But none can truly say that mine Are known to him at all. I never, never talk you o'erâ In truth, I never get the floor. AN EXILE 'Tis the census enumerator A-singing all forlorn: âIt's ho! for the tall potater, And ho! for the clustered corn. The whiffle-tree bends in the breeze and the fine Large eggs are a-ripening on the vine. âSome there must be to till the soil And the widow's weeds keep down. I wasn't cut out for rural toil But they won't let me live in town! They're not so many by two or three, As they think, but ah! they're too many for me.â Thus the census man, bowed down with care, Warbled his wood-note high. There was blood on his brow and blood in his hair, But he had no blood in his eye. THE DIVISION SUPERINTENDENT Baffled he stands upon the trackâ The automatic switches clack. Where'er he turns his solemn eyes The interlocking signals rise. The trains, before his visage pale, Glide smoothly by, nor leave the rail. No splinter-spitted victim he Hears uttering the note high C. In sorrow deep he hangs his head, A-wearyâwould that he were dead. Now suddenly his spirits riseâ A great thought kindles in his eyes. Hope like a headlight's vivid glare, Splendors the path of his despair. His genius shines, the clouds roll backâ âI'll place obstructions on the track!â TO A PROFESSIONAL EULOGIST Newman, in you two parasites combine: As tapeworm and as graveworm too you shine. When on the virtues of the quick you've dwelt, The pride of residence was all you felt (What vain vulgarian the wish ne'er knew To paint his lodging a flamboyant hue?) And when the praises of the dead you've sung, 'Twas appetite, not truth, inspired your tongue; As ill-bred men when warming to their wine Boast of its merit though it be but brine. Not gratitude incites your song, nor shouldâ Even Charity would shun you if she could. You share, 'tis true, the rich man's daily dole, But what you get you take by way of toll. Vain to resist youâvermifuge alone Has power to push you from your robber throne. When to escape you he's compelled to die, Hey! presto!âin the twinkling of an eye You vanish as a tapeworm, reappear As graveworm and resume your curst career. As host no more, to satisfy your need He serves as dinner your unaltered greed. O thrifty sycophant to wealth and fame, Son of servility and priest of shame, While naught your mad ambition can abate To lick the spittle of the rich and great; While still like smoke your eulogies arise To soot your heroes and inflame our eyes; While still with holy oil, like that which ran Down Aaron's beard, you smear each famous man, I cannot choose but think it very odd It ne'er occurs to you to fawn on God. ELECTION DAY Despots effete upon tottering thrones Unsteadily poised upon dead men's bones, Walk up! walk up! the circus is free, And this wonderful spectacle you shall see: Millions of voters who mostly are fools, Demagogues' dupes and candidates' toolsâ Armies of uniformed mountebanks, And braying disciples of brainless cranks. Many a week they've bellowed like beeves, Bitterly blackguarding, lying like thieves, Libeling freely the quick and the dead And painting the New Jerusalem red. Tyrants monarchicalâemperors, kings, Princes and nobles and all such thingsâ Noblemen, gentlemen, step this way: There's nothing, the Devil excepted, to pay, And the freaks and curios here to be seen Are very uncommonly grand and serene. No more with vivacity they debate, Nor cheerfully crack the dissenting pate; No longer, the dull understanding to aid, The stomach accepts the instructive blade, Nor the stubborn heart learns what is what From a revelation of rabbit-shot; And vilification's flamesâbehold! Burn with a bickering faint and cold. Magnificent spectacle!âevery tongue Suddenly civil that yesterday rung (Like the clapper beating a brazen bell) Each fair reputation's eternal knell; Hands no longer delivering blows, And noses, for counting, arrayed in rows. Walk up, gentlemenânothing to payâ The Devil goes back to Hell to-day. THE MILITIAMAN âO warrior with the burnished arms, With bullion cord and tassel, Pray tell me of the lurid charms Of service and its fierce alarms: The storming of the castle, The charge across the smoking field, The rifles' busy rattleâ What thoughts inspire the men who wield The bladeâtheir gallant souls how steeled And fortified in battle.â âNay, man of peace, seek not to know War's baleful fascinationâ The soldier's hunger for the foe, His dread of safety, joy to go To court annihilation. Though calling bugles blow not now, Nor drums begin to beat yet, One fear unmans me, I'll allow, And poisons all my pleasure: How If I should get my feet wet!â A WELCOME Because you call yourselves Knights Templars, and There's neither Knight nor Temple in the land,â Because you thus by vain pretense degrade To paltry purposes traditions grand,â Because to cheat the ignorant you say The thing that's not, elated still to sway The crass credulity of gaping fools And women by fantastical display,â Because no sacred fires did ever warm Your hearts, high knightly service to performâ A woman's breast or coffer of a man The only citadel you dare to storm,â Because while railing still at lord and peer, At pomp and fuss-and-feathers while you jeer, Each member of your order tries to graft A peacock's tail upon his barren rear,â Because that all these things are thus and so, I bid you welcome to our city. Lo! You're free to come, and free to stay, and free, As soon as it shall please you, sirsâto go. A SERENADE â??? ?????, ??? ?????,â He sang beneath her lattice. ââSas agapoâ?â she murmuredââO, I wonder, now what that is!â Was she less fair that she did bear So light a load of knowledge? Are tender looks got out of books, Or kisses taught in college? Of woman's lore give me no more Than how to love. In many A tongue men brawl; she speaks them all Who says âI love,â in any. THE WISE AND GOOD âO father, I saw at the church as I passed The populace gathered in numbers so vast That they cculdn't get in; and their voices were low, And they looked as if suffering terrible woe.â â'Twas the funeral, child, of a gentleman dead For whom the great heart of humanity bled.â âWhat made it bleed, father, for every day Somebody, somewhere, passes away? Do the newspaper men print a column or more Of every person whose troubles are o'er?â âO, no; they could never do thatâand indeed, Though printers might print it, no reader would read. To the sepulcher all, soon or late, must be borne, But 'tis only the Wise and Good that we mourn.â âThat's right, father dear, but how can our eyes Distinguish in dead men the Good and the Wise?â âThat's easy enough to the stupidest mind: They're poor, and in dying leave nothing behind.â âSeest thou in mine eye, father, anything green? And takest thy son for a gaping marine? Go tell thy fine tale of the Wise and the Good Who are poor, yet lamented, to babes in the wood.â And that horrible youth as I hastened away Was building a wink that affronted the day. THE LOST COLONEL â'Tis a woful yarn,â said the sailorman bold Who had sailed the northern lakesâ âNo wofuler one has ever been told, Exceptin' them called âfakes.ââ âGo on, thou son of the wind and fog, For I burn to know the worst!â But his silent lip in a glass of grog Was dreamily immersed. Then he wiped it upon his sleeve and said: âIt's never like that I drinks But what of a gallant gent that's dead I truly mournful thinks. âHe was a soldier chapâleastways As âColonelâ he was knew; An' he hailed from some'rs where they raise A grass that's heavenly blue. âHe sailed as a passenger aboard The schooner âHenery Jo.â O wild the waves and galeses roared, Like taggers in a show! âBut he sat at table that calm an' mild As if he never had let His sperit know that the waves was wild An' everlastin' wet!â âJest set with a bottle before his nose, As was labeled âTotal Eclipseâ (The bottle was) an' he frequent rose A glass o' the same to his lips. âAn' he says to me (for the steward slick Of the âHenery Joâ was I): âThis sailor life's the very old Nickâ On the lakes it's powerful dry!â âI says: âAye, aye, sir, it beats the Dutch. I hopes you'll outlast the trip.â But if I'd been himâan' I said as muchâ I'd âaâ took a faster ship. âHis laughture, loud an' long an' free, Rang out o'er the tempest's roar. âYou're an elegant reasoner,â says he, âBut it's powerful dry ashore!ââ âO mariner man, why pause and don A look of so deep concern? Have another glassâgo on, go on, For to know the worst I burn.â âOne day he was leanin' over the rail, When his footing some way slipped, An' (this is the wofulest part o' my tale) He was accidental unshipped! âThe empty boats was overboard hove, As he swum in the âHenery'sâ wake; But 'fore we had 'bouted ship he had drove From sight on the ragin' lake!â âAnd so the poor gentleman was drownedâ And now I'm apprised of the worst.â âWhat! him? 'Twas an hour afore he was foundâ In the yawlâstone dead o' thirst!â FOR TAT O heavenly powers! will wonders never cease?â Hair upon dogs and feathers upon geese! The boys in mischief and the pigs in mire! The drinking water wet! the coal on fire! In meadows, rivulets surpassing fair, Forever running, yet forever there! A tail appended to the gray baboon! A person coming out of a saloon! Last, and of all most marvelous to see, A female Yahoo flinging filth at me! If 'twould but stick I'd bear upon my coat May Little's proof that she is fit to vote. A DILEMMA Filled with a zeal to serve my fellow men, For years I criticised their prose and verses: Pointed out all their blunders of the pen, Their shallowness of thought and feeling; then Damned them up hill and down with hearty curses! They said: âThat's all that he can doâjust sneer, And pull to pieces and be analytic. Why doesn't he himself, eschewing fear, Publish a book or two, and so appear As one who has the right to be a critic? âLet him who knows it all forbear to tell How little others know, but show his learning.â And then they added: âWho has written well May censure freelyââquoting Pope. I fell Into the trap and books began out-turning,â Books by the scoreâfine prose and poems fair, And not a book of them but was a terror, They were so great and perfect; though I swear I tried right hard to work in, here and there, (My nature still forbade) a fault or error. 'Tis true, some wretches, whom I'd scratched, no doubt, Professed to findâbut that's a trifling matter. Now, when the flood of noble books was out I raised o'er all that land a joyous shout Till I was thought as mad as any hatter! (Why hatters all are mad, I cannot say. 'Twere wrong in their affliction to revile 'em, But truly, you'll confess 'tis very sad We wear the ugly things they make. Begad, They'd be less mischievous in an asylum!) Consistency, thou art aâwell, you're paste! When next I felt my demon in possession, And made the field of authorship a waste, All said of me: âWhat execrable taste, To rail at others of his own profession!â Good Lord! where do the critic's rights begin Who has of literature some clear-cut notion, And hears a voice from Heaven say: âPitch inâ? He finds himselfâalas, poor son of sinâ Between the devil and the deep blue ocean! METEMPSYCHOSIS Once with Christ he entered Salem, Once in Moab bullied Balaam, Once by Apuleius staged He the pious much enraged, And, again, his head, as beaver, Topped the neck of Nick the Weaver. Omar saw him (minus tetherâ Free and wanton as the weather: Knowing naught of bit nor spur) Stamping over Bahram-Gur. Now, as Altgeld, see him joy As Governor of Illinois! THE SAINT AND THE MONK Saint Peter at the gate of Heaven displayed The tools and terrors of his awful trade; The key, the frown as pitiless as night, That slays intending trespassers at sight, And, at his side in easy reach, the curled Interrogation points all ready to be hurled. Straight up the shining cloudway (it so chanced No others were about) a soul advancedâ A fat, orbicular and jolly soul With laughter-lines upon each rosy jowlâ A monk so prepossessing that the saint Admired him, breathless until weak and faint, Forgot his frown and all his questions too, Foregoing even the customary âWho?ââ Threw wide the gate and with a friendly grin Said: â'Tis a very humble home, but pray walk in.â The soul smiled pleasantly. âExcuse me, pleaseâ Who's in there?â By insensible degrees This impudence dispelled the saint's esteem, As dawning consciousness dispels a dream. The frown began to blacken on his brow, His hand to reach for âWhence?â and âWhy?â and âHow?â âO, no offense, I hope,â the soul explained; âI'm ratherâwell, particular. I've strained A point in coming here at all; 'tis said That Susan Anthony (I hear she's dead At last) and all her followers are here. As company, they'd beâconfess itârather queer.â The saint replied, his rising anger past: âWhat can I do?âthe law is hard-and-fast, Albeit unwritten and on earth unknownâ An oral order issued from the Throne: By but one sin has Woman e'er incurred God's wrath. To accuse Them Loud of that would be absurd.â That friar sighed, but, calling up a smile, Said, slowly turning on his heel the while: âFarewell, my friend. Put up the chain and barâ I'm going, so please you, where the pretty women are.â 1895. IN HIGH LIFE Sir Impycu Lacquit, from over the sea, Has led to the altar Miss Bloatie Bondee. The wedding took place at the Church of St. Blare; The fashion, the rank, and the wealth were all there. No person was absent of all that one meets: Lord Mammon himself bowed them into their seats, While good Sir John Satan attended the door, And Sexton BeÃ«lzebub managed the floor, Respectfully keeping each dog on its rugâ Preserving the peace between poodle and pug. Twelve bridesmaids escorted the bride up the aisle, To blush in her blush and to smile in her smile; Twelve groomsmen supported the eminent groom, To scowl in his scowl and to gloom in his gloom. The rites were performed by the hand and the lip Of his Grace the Diocesan, Osculo Grip Assisted by three able-bodied divines; He prayed and they grunted, he read, they made signs. Such fashion, such beauty, such gowning, such grace Were ne'er before seen in that heavenly place! That night, full of gin and patrician pride, Sir Impycu blackened the eyes of his bride. A WHIPPER-IN Commissioner of Pensions Dudley has established a Sunday-school and declares he will remove any clerk in his department who does not regularly attend.â N. Y. World. Dudley, great placeman, man of mark and note, Worthy of honor from a feeble pen Blunted in service of all true, good men, You serve the Lordâin courses, table d'hÃ´te: Au naturel, as well as Ã  la Nickâ âEat and be thankful, though it make you sick.â O, truly pious caterer, forbear To push the Saviour and Him crucified (Brochette you'd call it) into their inside Who're all unused to such ambrosial fare. The stomach of the soul makes quick revulsion Of aught that it has taken on compulsion. I search the Scripture, but I do not find That e'er the Spirit beats with angry wings For entrance to the heart, but sits and sings To charm away the scruples of the mind. It says: âReceive me, please; I'll not compelââ Though if you don't you will go straight to Hell! Well, that's compulsion, you will say. 'Tis true: We cower timidly beneath the rod Lifted in menace by an angry God, But won't endure it from an ape like you. Detested simian with thumb prehensile, Switch me and I would brain you with my pencil! Face you the Throne, nor dare to turn your back On its transplendency to flog some wight Who gropes and stumbles in the infernal night Your ugly shadow lays along his track. O, Thou who from the Temple scourged the sin, Behold what rascals try to scourge it in! JUDGMENT I drew aside the Future's veil And saw upon his bier The poet Whitman. Loud the wail And damp the falling tear. âHe's deadâhe is no more!â one cried, With sobs of sorrow crammed; âNo more? He's this much more,â replied Another: âhe is damned!â 1885. A BUBBLE Mrs. Mehitable Marcia Moore Was a dame of superior mind, With a gown which, modestly fitting before, Was greatly puffed up behind. The bustle she wore was ingeniously planned With an inspiration bright: It magnified seven diameters and Was remarkably nice and light. It was made of rubber and edged with lace And riveted all with brass, And the whole immense interior space Inflated with hydrogen gas. The ladies all said when she hove in view Like the round and rising moon: âShe's a stuck up thing!â which was partly true, And men called her the Captive Balloon. To Manhattan Beach for a bath one day She went and she said: âO dear! If I leave off this what will people say? I shall look so uncommonly queer!â So a costume she had accordingly made To take it all nicely in, And when she appeared in that suit arrayed, She was greeted with many a grin. Proudly and happily looking around, She waded out into the wet; But the water was very, very profound, And her feet and her forehead met! As her bubble drifted away from the shore, On the glassy billows borne, All cried: âWhy, where is Mehitable Moore? I saw her go in, I'll be sworn!â Then the bulb it swelled as the sun grew hot, Till it burst with a sullen roar, And the sea like oil closed over the spotâ Farewell, O Mehitable Moore! FRANCINE Did I believe the angels soon would call You, my beloved, to the other shore, And I should never see you any more, I love you so I know that I should fall Into dejection utterly, and all Love's pretty pageantry, wherein we bore Twin banners bravely in the tumult's fore, Would seem as shadows idling on a wall. So daintily I love you that my love Endures no rumor of the winter's breath, And only blossoms for it thinks the sky Forever gracious, and the stars above Forever friendly. Even the fear of death Were frost wherein its roses all would die. AN EXAMPLE They were two deaf mutes. They loved and they Resolved to be groom and bride; And they listened to nothing that any could say, Nor ever a word replied. From wedlock when warned by the married men, Maintain an invincible mind: Be deaf and dumb until weddedâand then Be deaf and dumb and blind. REVENGE A spitcat sate on a garden gate And a snapdog fared beneath; Careless and free was his mien, and he Held a fiddle-string in his teeth. She marked his march, she wrought an arch Of her back and blew up her tail; And her eyes were green as ever were seen, And she uttered a woful wail. The spitcat's plaint was as follows: âIt ain't That I am to music a foe; For fiddle-strings bide in my own inside, And I twang them soft and low. âBut that dog has trifled with art and rifled A kitten of mine, ah me! That catgut slim was marauded from him: 'Tis the string that men call E.â Then she sounded high, in the key of Y, A note that cracked the tombs; And the missiles through the firmament flew From adjacent sleeping-rooms. As her gruesome yell from the gate-post fell She followed it down to earth; And that snapdog wears a placard that bears The inscription: âBlind from birth.â THE GENESIS OF EMBARRASSMENT When Adam first saw Eve he said: âO lovely creature, share my bed.â Before consenting, she her gaze Fixed on the greensward to appraise, As well as vision could avouch, The value of the proffered couch. And seeing that the grass was green And soft and scrupulously clean; Observing that the flow'rs were rare Varieties, and some were fair, The posts of precious woods, and each Bore luscious fruit in easy reach, And all things suited well her worth, She raised her angel eyes from earth To his and, blushing to confess, Murmured: âI love you, Adamâyes.â Since then her daughters, it is said, Look always down when asked to wed. IN CONTUMACIAM Och! Father McGlynn, Ye appear to be in Fer a bit of a bout wid the Pope; An' there's devil a doubt But he's knockin' ye out While ye're hangin' onto the rope. An' soon ye'll lave home To thravel to Rome, For its bound to Canossa ye are. Persistin' to shtay When ye're ordered awayâ Bedad! that is goin' too far! FROM THE MINUTES When, with the force of a ram that discharges its ponderous body Straight at the rear elevation of the luckless culler of simples, The foot of Herculean Kilgoreâstatesman of surname suggestive Or carnage unspeakable!âlit like a missile solid, prodigious Upon the Congressional door with a monstrous and mighty momentum, Causing the vain ineffective bar to political freedom To fly from its hinges, effacing the nasal excrescence of Dingley, That luckless one, decently veiling the ruin with ready bandanna, Lamented the loss of his eminence, sadly with sobs as follows: âAh, why was I ever elected to the halls of legislation, So soon to be shown the door with pitiless emphasis? Truly, I've leaned on a broken Reed, and the same has gone back on me meanly. Where now is my prominence, erstwhile in council conspicuous, patent? Alas, I did never before understand what now I see clearly, To wit, that Democracy tends to level all human distinctions!â A WOMAN IN POLITICS What, madam, run for School Director? You? And want my vote and influence? Well, well, That beats me! Gad! what are we coming to? In all my life I never have heard tell Of such sublime presumption, and I smell A nigger in the fence! Excuse me, madam; We statesmen sometimes speak like the old Adam. But now you mention itâwell, well, who knows? We might, that's certain, give the sex a show. I have a cousinâteacher. I suppose If I stand in and you're electedâno? You'll make no bargains? That's a pretty go! But understand that school administration Belongs to politics, not education. We'll pass the teacher deal; but it were wise To understand each other at the start. You know my businessâbooks and school supplies; You'd hardly, if elected, have the heart Some small advantage to deny meâpart Of all my profits to be yours. What? âStealingâ? Please don't express yourself with so much feeling. You pain me, truly. Now one question more. Suppose a fair young man should ask a place As teacherâwould you (pardon) shut the door Of the Department in his handsome face UntilâI know not how to put the caseâ Would you extort a kiss to pay your favor? Good Lord! you laugh? I thought the matter graver. Well, well, we can't do business, I suspect: A woman has no head for politics. My profitable offers you reject And will not promise anything to fix Things right that civic saints and angels mix. Good morning. StayâI'm chaffing you, conceitedly. Madam, I mean to vote for youârepeatedly. A BALLAD OF PIKEVILLE Down in Southern Arizona where the Gila monster thrives, And the âMescalero,â gifted with a hundred thousand lives, Every hour renounces one of them by drinking liquid flameâ The assassinating wassail that has given him his name; Where the enterprising dealer in Caucasian hair is seen To hold his harvest festival upon the village-green, While the late lamented tenderfoot upon the plain is spread With a sanguinary circle on the summit of his head; Where the cactuses (or cacti) lift their lances in the sun, And incautious jackass-rabbits come to sorrow as they run, Lived a colony of settlersâold Missouri was the State Where they formerly resided at a prehistoric date. Now, the spot that had been chosen for this colonizing scheme Was as waterless, believe me, as an Arizona stream. The soil was naught but ashes, by the breezes driven free, And an acre and a quarter were required to sprout a pea. So agriculture languished, for the land would not produce, And for lack of water, whisky was the beverage in useâ Costly whisky, hauled in wagons many a weary, weary day, Mostly needed by the drivers to sustain them on their way. Wicked whisky! King of Evils! Why, O why did God create Such a curse and thrust it on us in our inoffensive state? Once a parson came among them, and a holy man was he; With his ailing stomach whisky wouldn't anywise agree; So he knelt upon the mesa and he prayed with all his chin That the Lord would send them water or incline their hearts to gin. Scarcely was the prayer concluded ere an earthquake shook the land, And with copious effusion springs burst out on every hand! Merrily the waters gurgled, and the shock which gave them birth Fitly was by some declared a temperance movement of the earth. Astounded by the miracle, the people met that night To celebrate it properly by some religious rite; And 'tis truthfully recorded that before the moon had sunk Every man and every woman were devotionally drunk. A half a standard gallon (says history) per head Of the best Kentucky prime was at that ceremony shed. O the glory of that country! O the happy, happy folk By the might of prayer delivered from Nature's iron yoke! Lo! the plains to the horizon all are yellowing with rye, And the corn upon the hill-top lifts its banners to the sky! Gone the wagons, gone the drivers, and the road is grown to grass, Over which the incalescent Bourbon did aforetime pass. Pikeville (that's the name they've given, in their wild, romantic way, To that irrigation district) now distills, statistics say, Something like a hundred gallons, out of each recurrent crop, To the head of populationâand consumes it, every drop! AN AUGURY Upon my desk a single spray, With starry blossoms fraught. I write in many an idle way, Thinking one serious thought. âO flowers, a fine Greek name ye bear, And with a fine Greek grace.â (Be still, O heart that turns to share The sunshine of a face.) âHave ye no messagesâno brief, Still sign: âDespair,â or âHopeâ?â A sudden stir of stem and leafâ A breath of heliotrope! LUSUS POLITICUS Come in, old gentleman. How do you do? Delighted, I'm sure, that you've called. I'm a sociable sort of a chap and you Are a pleasant-appearing person, too, With a head agreeably bald. That's rightâsit down in the scuttle of coal And put up your feet in a chair. It is better to have them there; And I've always said that a hat of lead, Such as I see you wear, Is a better hat than a hat of glass. And your boots of brass Are a natural kind of boots, I swear. âMay you wipe your nose on a paper of pins?â Why, certainly, man, why not? I rather expected you'd do so before, When I saw you poking it in at the door. It's dev'lish hotâ The weather, I mean. âYou are twins?â Why, that was evident at the start, From the way that you paint your head In stripes of purple and red, With dots of yellow. That proves you a fellow With a love of legitimate art. âYou've bitten a snake and are feeling badâ? That's very sad, But Longfellow's words I beg to recall: Your lot is the common lot of all. âHorses are trees and the moon is a sneezeâ? That, I fancy, is just as you please. Some think that way, and others hold The contrary view; I never quite knew, For the matter o' that, When everything has been said. May I offer this mat If you will stand on your head? I suppose I look to be upside down From your present point of view. It's a giddy old world, from king to clown. And a topsy-turvy, too. But, worthy and now uninverted old man, You're built, at least, on a normal plan If ever a truth I spoke. Smoke? Your air and conversation Are a liberal education, And your clothes, including the metal hat And the brazen bootsâwhat's that? âYou never could stomach a Democrat Since General Jackson ran? You're another sort, but you predict That your party'll get consummately licked?â Good God! what a queer old man! BEREAVEMENT A Countess (so they tell the tale) Who dwelt of old in Arno's vale, Where ladies, even of high degree, Know more of love than of A, B, C, Came once with a prodigious bribe Unto the learned village scribe, That most discreet and honest man Who wrote for all the lover clan, Nor e'er a secret had betrayed Save when inadequately paid. âWrite me,â she sobbedââI pray thee doâ A book about the Prince di Giuâ A book of poetry in praise Of all his works and all his ways; The godlike grace of his address, His more than woman's tenderness, His courage stern and lack of guile, The loves that wantoned in his smile. So great he was, so rich and kind, I'll not within a fortnight find His equal as a lover. O, My God! I shall be drowned in woe!â âWhat! Prince di Giu is dead?â exclaimed The honest man for letters famed, The while he pocketed her gold; âOf what?âif I may be so bold.â Fresh storms of tears the lady shed: âI stabbed him fifty times,â she said. A PICKBRAIN What! imitate me, friend? Suppose that you With agony and difficulty do What I do easilyâwhat then? You've got A style I heartily wish I had not. If I from lack of sense and you from choice Grieve the judicious and the unwise rejoice, No equal censure our deserts will suitâ We both are fools, but you're an ape to boot! THE NAVAL CONSTRUCTOR He looked upon the ships as they All idly lay at anchor, Their sides with gorgeous workmen gayâ The riveter and plankerâ Republicans and Democrats, Statesmen and politicians. He saw the swarm of prudent rats Swimming for land positions. He marked each âbelted cruiserâ fine, Her poddy life-belts floating In tether where the hungry brine Impinged upon her coating. He noted with a proud regard, As any of his class would, The poplar mast and poplar yard Above the hull of bass-wood. He saw the Eastlake frigate tall, With quaintly carven gable, Hip-roof and dormer-windowâall With ivy formidable. In short, he saw our country's hope In best of all conditionsâ Equipped, to the last spar and rope, By working politicians. He boarded then the noblest ship And from the harbor glided. âAdieu, adieu!â fell from his lip. Verdict: âHe suicided.â 1881. DETECTED In Congress once great Mowther shone, Debating weighty matters; Now into an asylum thrown, He vacuously chatters. If in that legislative hall His wisdom still he'd vented, It never had been known at all That Mowther was demented. BIMETALISM Ben Bulger was a silver man, Though not a mine had he: He thought it were a noble plan To make the coinage free. âThere hain't for years been sech a time,â Said Ben to his bull pup, âFor bizâthe country's broke and I'm The hardest kind of up. âThe paper says that that's because The silver coins is sca'ce, And that the chaps which makes the laws Puts gold ones in their place. âThey says them nations always be Most prosperatin' where The wolume of the currency Ain't so disgustin' rare.â His dog, which hadn't breakfasted, Dissented from his view, And wished that he could swell, instead, The volume of cold stew. âNobody'd put me up,â said Ben, âWith patriot galoots Which benefits their feller men By playin' warious roots; âBut havin' all the tools about, I'm goin' to commence A-turnin' silver dollars out Wuth eighty-seven cents. âThe feller takin' 'em can't whine; (No more, likewise, can I): They're better than the genooine, Which mostly satisfy. âIt's only makin' coinage free, And mebby might augment The wolume of the currency A noomerous per cent.â I don't quite see his error nor Malevolence prepense, But fifteen years they gave him for That technical offense. TWO METHODS To bucks and ewes by the Good Shepherd fed The Priest delivers masses for the dead, And even from estrays outside the fold Death for the masses he would not withhold. The Parson, loth alike to free or kill, Forsakes the souls already on the grill, And, God's prerogative of mercy shamming, Spares living sinners for a harder damning. FOUNDATIONS OF THE STATE Observe, dear Lord, what lively pranks Are played by sentimental cranks! First this one mounts his hinder hoofs And brays the chimneys off the roofs; Then that one, with exalted voice, Expounds the thesis of his choice, Our understandings to bombard, Till all the window panes are starred! A third augments the vocal shock Till steeples to their bases rock, Confessing, as they humbly nod, They hear and mark the will of God. A fourth in oral thunder vents His pinching penury of sense Till dogs with sympathetic howls, And lowing cows, and cackling fowls, Hens, geese, and all domestic birds, Attest the terror of his words. Cranks thus their intellects deflate Of theories about the State. This one avers 'tis built on Truth, And that on Temperance. This youth Declares that Science bears the pile; That graybeard, with a holy smile, Says Faith is the supporting stone; While women swear that Love alone Could so unflinchingly endure The heavy load. And some are sure The solemn state of Christian Wedlock Is the indubitable bedrock. Physicians once about the bed Of one whose life was nearly sped Blew up a disputatious breeze About the cause of his disease: This, that and t'other thing they blamed. âTut, tut!â the dying man exclaimed, âWhat made me ill I do not care; You've not an ounce of it, I'll swear. And if you had the skill to make it I'd see you hanged before I'd take it!â AN IMPOSTOR Must you, Carnegie, evermore explain Your worth, and all the reasons give again Why black and red are similarly white And you and God identically right? Still must our ears without redress submit To hear you play the solemn hypocrite Walking in spirit some high moral level, Raising at once his eye-balls and the devil? Great King of Cant! if Nature had but made Your mouth without a tongue I ne'er had prayed To have an earless head. Since she did not, Bear me, ye whirlwinds, to some favored spotâ Some mountain pinnacle that sleeps in air So delicately, mercifully rare That when the fellow climbs that giddy hill, As, for my sins, I know at last he will, To utter twaddle in that void inane His soundless organ he will play in vain. FRANCE Unhappy State! with horrors still to strive: Thy Hugo dead, thy Boulanger alive; A Prince who'd govern where he dares not dwell, And who for power would his birthright sellâ Who, eager o'er his enemies to reign, Grabs at the scepter and conceals the chain; While pugnant factions mutually strive By cutting throats to keep the land alive. Perverse in passion, as in pride perverseâ To all a mistress, to thyself a curse; Sweetheart of Europe! every sun's embrace Matures the charm and poison of thy grace. Yet time to thee nor peace nor wisdom brings: In blood of citizens and blood of kings The stones of thy stability are set, And the fair fabric trembles at a threat. A GUEST Death, are you well? I trust you have no cough That's painful or in any way annoyingâ No kidney trouble that may carry you off, Nor heart disease to keep you from enjoying Your mealsâand ours. 'Twere very sad indeed To have to quit the busy life you lead. You've been quite active lately for so old A person, and not very strong-appearing. I'm apprehensive, somehow, that my bold, Bad brother gave you trouble in the spearing. And my two friendsâI fear, sir, that you ran Quite hard for them, especially the man. I crave your pardon: 'twas no fault of mine; If you are overworked I'm sorry, very. Come in, old man, and have a glass of wine. What shall it beâmadeira, port or sherry? What! just a mug of blood? That's funny grog To ask a friend for, eh? Well, take it, hog! A FALSE PROPHECY Dom Pedro, Emperor of far Brazil (Whence coffee comes, and the three-cornered nut) They say that you're imperially ill, And threatened with paralysis. Tut-tut! Though Emperors are mortal, nothing but A nimble thunderbolt could catch and kill A man predestined to depart this life By the assassin's bullet, bomb or knife. Sir, once there was a President who freed Four million slaves; and once there was a Czar Who freed ten times as many serfs. Sins breed The means of punishment, and tyrants are Hurled headlong out of the triumphal car If faster than the law allows they speed. Lincoln and Alexander struck a rut; You freed slaves too. Paralysis!âtut-tut. 1885. A SONG OF THE MANY God's people sorely were oppressed, I heard their lamentations long;â I hear their singing, clear and strong, I see their banners in the West! The captains shout the battle-cry, The legions muster in their might; They turn their faces to the light, They lift their arms, they testify: âWe sank beneath the masters' thong, Our chafing chains were ne'er undone;â Now clash your lances in the sun And bless your banners with a song! âGod bides His time with patient eyes While tyrants build upon the land;â He lifts His face, He lifts His hand, And from the stones His temples rise. âNow Freedom waves her joyous wing Beyond the foemen's shields of gold. March forward singing, for, behold, The right shall rule while God is King!â ONE MORNING Because that I am weak, my love, and ill I cannot follow the impatient feet Of my desire, but sit and watch the beat Of the unpitying pendulum fulfill The hour appointed for the air to thrill And brighten at your coming. O my sweet, The tale of moments is at last completeâ The tryst is broken on the gusty hill! O lady, faithful-footed, loyal-eyed, The long leagues silence me; yet doubt me not: Think rather that the clock and sun have lied And all too early you have sought the spot. For lo! despair has darkened all the light, And till I see your face it still is night. THE KING OF BORES Abundant bores afflict this world, and some Are bores of magnitude that come andâno, They're always coming, but they never goâ Like funeral pageants, as they drone and hum Their lurid nonsense like a muffled drum, Or bagpipe's dread, unnecessary flow. But one superb tormentor I can showâ Prince Fiddlefaddle, Duc de Feefawfum. He the johndonkey is who, when I pen Amorous verses in an idle mood To nobody, or of her, reads them through And, smirking, says he knows the lady; then Calls me sly dog. I wish he understood This tender sonnet's application too. HISTORY What wrecked the Roman power? One says vice, Another indolence, another dice. Emascle says polygamy. âNot so,â Says Impycuââ'twas luxury and show.â The parson, lifting up a brow of brass, Swears superstition gave the coup de grÃ¢ce. Great Allison, the statesman-chap affirms 'Twas lack of coin (croaks Medico: â'Twas worms!â)â And John P. Jones the swift suggestion collars, Averring the no coins were silver dollars. Thus, through the ages, each presuming quack Turns the poor corpse upon its rotten back, Holds a new âautopsyâ and finds that death Resulted partly from the want of breath, But chiefly from some visitation sad That points his argument to serve his fad. They're all in errorânever human mind The cause of the disaster has divined. What slew the Roman power? Well, provided You'll keep the secret, I will tell you. I did. THE HERMIT To a hunter from the city, Overtaken by the night, Spake, in tones of tender pity For himself, an aged wight: âI have found the world a fountain Of deceit and Life a sham. I have taken to the mountain And a Holy Hermit am. âSternly bent on Contemplation, Far apart from human kindâ In the hill my habitation, In the Infinite my mind. âTen long years I've lived a dumb thing, Growing bald and bent with dole, Vainly seeking for a Something To engage my gloomy soul. âGentle Pilgrim, while my roots you Eat, and quaff my simple drink, Please suggest whatever suits you As a Theme for me to Think.â Then the hunter answered gravely: âFrom distraction free, and strife, You could ponder very bravely On the Vanity of Life.â âO, thou wise and learned Teacher, You have solved the Problem wellâ You have saved a grateful creature From the agonies of Hell! âTake another root, another Cup of water: eat and drink. Now I have a Subject, brother, Tell me what, and how, to think.â THE YEARLY LIE A merry Christmas? Prudent, as I live!â You wish me something that you need not give. Merry or sad, what does it signify? To you 'tis equal if I laugh, or die. Your hollow greeting, like a parrot's jest, Finds all its meaning in the ear addressed. Why âmerryâ Christmas? Faith, I'd rather frown Than grin and caper like a tickled clown. When fools are merry the judicious weep; The wise are happy only when asleep. A present? Pray you give it to disarm A man more powerful to do you harm. 'Twas not your motive? Well, I cannot let You pay for favors that you'll never get. Perish the ancient custom of the gift, Founded in terror and maintained in thrift! What men of honor need to aid their weal They purchase, or, occasion serving, steal. Go celebrate the day with turkeys, pies, Sermons and psalms and, for the children, lies. Let Santa Claus descend again the flue; If Baby doubt it, swear that it is true. âA lie well stuck to is as good as truth,â And God's too old to legislate for youth. Hail Christmas! On my knees and fowl I fall; For greater grace and better gravy call. Vive l'Humbug!âthat's to say, God bless us all! AN APOLOGUE A traveler observed one day A loaded fruit-tree by the way, And reining in his horse exclaimed: âThe man is greatly to be blamed Who, careless of good morals, leaves Temptation in the way of thieves. Now lest some villain pass this way And by this fruit be led astray To bag it, I will kindly pack It snugly in my saddle-sack.â He did so; then that Salt o' the Earth Rode on, rejoicing in his worth. DIAGNOSIS Cried Allen Forman: âDoctor, pray Compose my spirit's strife: O what may be my chances, say, Of living all my life? âFor lately I have dreamed of high And hempen dissolution! O doctor, doctor, how can I Amend my constitution?â The learned leech replied: âYou're young And beautiful and strongâ Permit me to inspect your tongue: H'm, ah, ahem!â'tis long.â FALLEN O, hadst thou died when thou wert great, When at thy feet a nation knelt To sob the gratitude it felt And thank the Saviour of the State, Gods might have envied thee thy fate! Then was the laurel round thy brow, And friend and foe spake praise of thee, While all our hearts sang victory. Alas! thou art too base to bow To hide the shame that brands it now. The Day of Wrath A recent republication of the late Gen. John A. Dix's disappointing translation of this famous medieval hymn, together with some researches into its history, which I happened to be making at the time, induces me to undertake a translation myself. It may seem presumption in me to attempt that which so many eminent scholars of so many generations have attempted before me; but failure of others encourages me to hope that success, being still unachieved, is still achievable. The fault of many translations, from Lord Macaulay's to that of Gen. Dix, has been, I venture to think, a too strict literalness, whereby the delicate irony and subtle humor of the immortal poemâthough doubtless these admirable qualities were valued by the translatorsâhave been sacrificed in the result. In none of the English versions that I have examined is more than a trace of the mocking spirit of insincerity pervading the whole prayer,âthe cool effrontery of the suppliant in enumerating his demerits, his serenely illogical demands of salvation in spite, or rather because, of them, his meek submission to the punishment of others, and the many similarly pleasing characteristics of this amusing work being most imperfectly conveyed. By permitting myself a reasonable freedom of renderingâin many cases boldly supplying that âmissing linkâ between the sublime and the ridiculous which the author, writing for the acute monkish apprehension of the thirteenth century, did not deem it necessary to insertâI have hoped at least partly to liberate the lurking devil of humor from his letters, letting him caper, not, certainly, as he does in the Latin, but as he probably would have done had his creator written in English. In preserving the meter and trochaic rhymes of the original, I have acted from the same reverent regard for the music with which, in the liturgy of the Church, the verses have become inseparably wedded that inspired Gen. Dix; seeking rather to surmount the obstacles to success by honest effort, than to avoid them by adopting an easier versification which would have deprived my version of all utility in religious service I must bespeak the reader's charitable consideration in respect of the first stanza, the insuperable difficulties of which seem to have been purposely contrived in order to warn off trespassers at the very boundary of the alluring domain. I have got over the inhibitionâsomehowâbut David and the Sibyl must try to forgive me if they find themselves represented merely by the names of those conspicuous personal qualities to which they probably owed their powers of prophecy, as Samson's strength lay in his hair. Day of Satan's painful duty! Earth shall vanish, hot and sooty; So says Virtue, so says Beauty. Ah! what terror shall be shaping When the Judge the truth's undrapingâ Cats from every bag escaping! Now the trumpet's invocation Calls the dead to condemnation; All receive an invitation. Death and Nature now are quaking, And the late lamented, waking, In their breezy shrouds are shaking. Lo! the Ledger's leaves are stirring, And the Clerk, to them referring, Makes it awkward for the erring. When the Judge appears in session, We shall all attend confession, Loudly preaching non-suppression How shall I then make romances Mitigating circumstances? Even the just must take their chances. King whose majesty amazes, Save thou him who sings thy praises; Fountain, quench my private blazes. Pray remember, sacred Saviour, Mine the playful hand that gave your Death-blow. Pardon such behavior. Seeking me, fatigue assailed thee, Calvary's outlook naught availed thee; Now 'twere cruel if I failed thee. Righteous judge and learnÃ¨d brother, Pray thy prejudices smother Ere we meet to try each other. Sighs of guilt my conscience gushes, And my face vermilion flushes; Spare me for my pretty blushes. Thief and harlot, when repenting, Thou forgavestâcomplimenting Me with sign of like relenting. If too bold is my petition I'll receive with due submission My dismissalâfrom perdition. When thy sheep thou hast selected From the goats, may I, respected, Stand amongst them undetected. When offenders are indicted, And with trial-flames ignited, Elsewhere I'll attend if cited. Ashen-hearted, prone and prayerful, When of death I see the air full, Lest I perish too be careful. On that day of lamentation, When, to enjoy the conflagration, Men come forth, O be not cruel: Spare me, Lordâmake them thy fuel. ONE MOOD'S EXPRESSION See, Lord, fanatics all arrayed For revolution! To foil their villainous crusade Unsheathe again the sacred blade Of persecution. What though through long disuse 'tis grown A trifle rusty? 'Gainst modern heresy, whose bone Is rotten, and the flesh fly-blown, It still is trusty. Of sterner stuff, thine ancient foes, Unapprehensive, Sprang forth to meet thy biting blows; Our zealots chiefly to the nose Assume the offensive. Then wield the blade their necks to hack, Nor ever spare one. Thy crowns of martyrdom unpack, But see that every martyr lack The head to wear one. SOMETHING IN THE PAPERS What's in the paper?â O, it's dev'lish dull: There's nothing happening at allâa lull After the war-storm. Mr. Someone's wife Killed by her lover with, I think, a knife. A fire on Blank Street and some babiesâone, Two, three or four, I don't remember, done To quite a delicate and lovely brown. A husband shot by woman of the townâ The same old story. Shipwreck somewhere south, The crew all savedâor lost. Uncommon drouth Makes hundreds homeless up the River Mudâ Though, come to think, I guess it was a flood. 'Tis feared some bank will burstâor else it won't; They always burst I fancyâor they don't; Who cares a cent?âthe banker pays his coin And takes his chances. Bullet in the groinâ But that's another item. Suicideâ Fool lost his money (serve him right) and died. Heigh-ho! there's nothâJerusalem! what's this? Tom Jones has failed! My God, what an abyss Of ruin!âowes me seven hundred, clear! Was ever such a damned disastrous year? THE BINNACLE The Church possesses the unerring compass whose needle points directly and persistently to the star of the eternal law of God.â Religious Weekly. The Church's compass, if you please, Has two or three (or more) degrees Of variation; And many a soul has gone to grief On this or that or t'other reef Through faith unreckoning or brief Miscalculation. Misguidance is of perils chief To navigation. The obsequious thing makes, too, you'll mark, Obeisance through a little arc Of declination; For Satan, fearing witches, drew From Death's pale horse, one day, a shoe, And nailed it to his door to undo Their machination. Since then the needle dips to woo His habitation. ONE PRESIDENT âWhat are those, father?â âStatesmen, my childâ Lachrymose, unparliamentary, wild.â âWhat are they that way for, father?â âLast fall, âOur candidate's better,â they said, âthan all!ââ âWhat did they say he was, father?â âA man Built on a straight and superior planâ Believing that none for an office would do Unless he were honest and capable too.â âPoor gentlemenâso disappointed!â âYes, lad, That is the feeling that's driving them mad; They're weeping and wailing and gnashing because They find that he's all that they said that he was.â THE BRIDE âYou know, my friends, with what a brave carouse I made a second marriage in my houseâ Divorced old barren Reason from my bed And took the Daughter of the Vine to spouse.â So sang the Lord of Poets. In a gleam Of light that made her like an angel seem, The Daughter of the Vine said: âI myself Am Reason, and the Other was a Dream.â THE MAN BORN BLIND A man born blind received his sight By a painful operation; And these are things he saw in the light Of an infant observation. He saw a merchant, good and wise And greatly, too, respected, Who looked, to those imperfect eyes, Like a swindler undetected. He saw a patriot address A noisy public meeting. He said: âWhy, that's a calf, I guess, That for the teat is bleating.â A doctor stood beside a bed And shook his summit sadly. âO see that foul assassin!â said The man that saw so badly. He saw a lawyer pleading for A thief whom they'd been jailing, And said: âThat's an accomplice or My sight again is failing.â Upon the Bench a Justice sat, With nothing to restrain him; â'Tis strange,â said the observer, âthat They ventured to unchain him.â With theologic works supplied, There was a solemn preacher; âA burglar with his kit,â he cried, âTo rob a fellow creature.â A bluff old farmer next he saw Sell produce in a village, And said: âWhat, what! is there no law To punish men for pillage?â A dame, tall, fair and stately, passed, Who many charms united; He thanked his stars his lot was cast Where sepulchers were whited. He saw a soldier stiff and stern, âFull of strange oathsâ and toddy, But was unable to discern A wound upon his body. Ten square leagues of rolling ground To one great man belonging, Looked like one little grassy mound With worms beneath it thronging. A palace's well carven stones, Where Dives dwelt contented, Seemed built throughout of human bones With human blood cemented. He watched the shining yellow thread A silk-worm was a-spinning; âThat creature's coining gold,â he said, âTo pay some girl for sinning.â His eyes were so untrained and dim All politics, religions, Arts, sciences, appeared to him But modes of plucking pigeons. And as he drew his final breath, He thought he saw with sorrow Some persons weeping for his death Who'd be all smiles to-morrow. A NIGHTMARE I dreamed that I was dead. The years went by: The world remembered gratefully that I Had lived and written, although other names Once hailed with homage, had in turn to die. Out of my grave a giant beech upgrew. Its roots transpierced my body, through and through, My substance fed its growth. From many lands Men came in troops that noble tree to view. 'Twas sacred to my memory and fameâ But Julian Hawthorne's wittol daughter came And with untidy finger daubed upon Its bark a reeking record of her name. A WET SEASON Horas non numero nisi serenas. The rain is fierce, it flogs the earth, And man's in danger. O that my mother at my birth Had borne a stranger! The flooded ground is all around, The depth uncommon. How blest I'd be if only she Had borne a salmon! If still denied the solar glow 'Twere bliss ecstatic To be amphibiousâbut O, To be aquatic! We're worms, men say, o' the dust, and they That faith are firm of. O, then, be just: show me some dust To be a worm of. The pines are chanting overhead A psalm uncheering. It's O, to have been for ages dead And hard of hearing! Restore, ye Pow'rs, the last bright hours The dial reckoned; 'Twas in the time of Egypt's primeâ Rameses II. THE CONFEDERATE FLAGS Tut-tut! give back the flagsâhow can you care, You veterans and heroes? Why should you at a kind intention swear Like twenty Neros? Suppose the act was not so overwiseâ Suppose it was illegal; Is't well on such a question to arise And pinch the Eagle? Nay, let's economize his breath to scold And terrify the alien Who tackles him, as Hercules of old The bird Stymphalian. Among the rebels when we made a breach Was it to get their banners? That was but incidentalâ'twas to teach Them better manners. They know the lesson well enough to-day; Now, let us try to show them That we're not only stronger far than they, (How we did mow them!) But more magnanimous. My lads, 'tis plain 'Twas an uncommon riot; The warlike tribes of Europe fight for gain; We fought for quiet. If we were victors, then we all must live With the same flag above us; 'Twas all in vain unless we now forgive And make them love us. Let kings keep trophies to display above Their doors like any savage; The freeman's trophy is the foeman's love, Despite war's ravage. âMake treason odious?â My friends, you'll find You can't, in right and reason, While âWashingtonâ and âtreasonâ are combinedâ âHugoâ and âtreason.â All human governments must take the chance And hazard of sedition. O wretch! to pledge your manhood in advance To blind submission. It may be wrong, it may be right, to rise In warlike insurrection: The loyalty that fools so dearly prize May mean subjection. Be loyal to your country, yesâbut how If tyrants hold dominion? The South believed they did; can't you allow For that opinion? He who will never rise though rulers plot, His liberties despisingâ How is he manlier than the sans-culottes Who's always rising? Give back the foolish flags whose bearers fell, Too valiant to forsake them. Is it presumptuous, this counsel? Well, I helped to take them. 1891. HÃC FABULA DOCET A rat who'd gorged a box of bane And suffered an internal pain Came from his hole to die (the label Required it if the rat were able) And found outside his habitat A limpid stream. Of bane and rat 'Twas all unconscious; in the sun It ran and prattled just for fun. Keen to allay his inward throes, The beast immersed his filthy nose And drankâthen, bloated by the stream, And filled with superheated steam, Exploded with a rascal smell, Remarking, as his fragments fell Astonished in the brook: âI'm thinking This water's damned unwholesome drinking!â AGAIN Well, I've met her againâat the Mission. She'd told me to see her no more; It was not a commandâa petition; I'd granted it once before. Yes, granted it, hoping she'd write me, Repenting her virtuous freakâ Subdued myself daily and nightly For the better part of a week. And then ('twas my duty to spare her The shame of recalling me) I Just sought her again to prepare her For an everlasting good-bye. O that evening of blissâshall I ever Cease living it over?âalthough She said, when 'twas ended: âYou're never To see me again. And now go.â As we parted with kisses 'twas human And natural for me to smile As I thought, âShe's in love, and a woman: She'll send for me after a while.â But she didn't; soâwell, the old Mission Is fine, picturesque and gray; 'Tis an excellent place for contritionâ And sometimes she passes that way. That's how it occurred that I met her, And that's all there is to tellâ Except that I'd like to forget her Calm way of remarking: âI'm well.â It was hardly worth while, all this keying My soul to such tensions and stirs To learn that her food was agreeing With that little stomach of hers. HOMO PODUNKENSIS As the poor ass that from his paddock strays Might sound abroad his field-companions' praise, Recounting volubly their well-bred leer, Their port impressive and their wealth of ear, Mistaking for the world's assent the clang Of echoes mocking his accurst harangue; So the dull clown, untraveled though at large, Visits the city on the ocean's marge, Expands his eyes and marvels to remark Each coastwise schooner and each alien bark; Prates of âall nationsâ, wonders as he stares That native merchants sell imported wares, Nor comprehends how in his very view A foreign vessel has a foreign crew; Yet, faithful to the hamlet of his birth, Swears it superior to aught on earth, Sighs for the temples locally renowned, The village school-house and the village pound, And chalks upon the palaces of Rome The peasant sentiments of âHome, Sweet Home!â A SOCIAL CALL Well, well, old Father Christmas, is it you, With your thick neck and thin pretense of virtue? Less redness in the noseânay, even some blue, Would not, I think, particularly hurt you. When seen close to, not mounted in your car, You look the drunkard and the pig you are. No matter, sit you down, for I am not In a gray study, as you sometimes find me. Merry? O, no, nor wish to be, God wot, But there's another year of pain behind me. That's something to be thankful for: the more There are behind, the fewer are before. I know you, Father Christmas, for a scamp, But Heaven endowed me at my soul's creation With an affinity to every tramp That walks the world and steals its admiration. For admiration is, like linen left Upon the line, got easiest by theft. Good God! old man, just think of it! I've stood, With brains and honesty, some five-and-twenty Long years as champion of all that's good, And taken on the mazzard thwacks a-plenty. Yet now whose praises do the people bawl? Those of the fellows whom I live to maul. Why, this is odd!âthe more I try to talk Of you, the more my tongue grows egotistic To prattle of myself! I'll try to balk Its waywardness and be more altruistic. So let us speak of othersâhow they sin, And what a devil of a state they're in! That's all I have to say. Good-bye, old man. Next year you possibly may find me scoldingâ Or miss me altogether: Nature's plan Includes, as I suppose, a final folding Of these poor empty hands. Then drop a tear To think they'll never box another ear. MY DAY OF LIFE I know not how it isâit seems Fantastic and surprising That after all these dreams and dreams, Here in the sun's first level beams, The sun is still just rising! When first he showed his sovereign face, And bade the night-folk scuttle Back to their holes, I took my place Here on the hill, and God His grace Sent slumber soft and subtle. Among the poppies red and white, I've lain and drowsed, for all it Appears a sluggardly delight. I must have had a wakeful night, Though, faith, I don't recall it. And, O I've dreamed so many things! One hardly can unravel The tangled web of visionings That slumber-of-the-morning brings: Play, study, work and travel; The love of women (mostly those Were fairest that were newest); Hard knocks from friends and other foes: Compacts with men (my memory shows The deadest are the truest); Warâwhat a hero I became By merely dreaming battle! Athwart the field of letters, Fame Blared through the brass my weary name With an ominous death-rattle. Such an eternity of thought Within a minute's fraction! Such phantoms out of nothing wrought, And fading suddenly to naught As I awake to action! They scamper each into its hole, These dreams of my begetting. They've had their moment; take, my soul, Thy day of life. ... Gods! this is drollâ That thieving sun is setting! SOME ANTE-MORTEM EPITAPHS A KING OF CRAFT Here lies Sam Chamberlain; his fatal smile Survives its wielder for a little while In nightmares of the prudent few who fled The Judas kisses that it heraldedâ Those all are dreamless who stood still to view The smile that stayed them for the stab that slew. Against his God his warfare now is o'er: His bloodless heart (no colder than before) No longer with a mute ambition swells To run a half-a-hundred little Hells. With ever a polite, perfidious artâ A dove in manner and a snake in heart, This titmouse Machiavelli ne'er again Will feel the urge, the passion and the strain To prove it true that one may smile and smile And be a Chamberlain the blessed while. Sharp at both ends, his secret soul Was like a double-headed mole Equipped with equal nose to prod This way or that beneath the sod. Conjecture fitted to confound If seen a moment out of groundâ Its former, as its future, route The matter of a vain dispute, Save where a dunghill's lure supplied Its aid the riddle to decide. When that occurred (his nearer nose Pointing the way with happier throes) He sought it as a bee the rose. And as that robber daubs its thighs With pollen till it cannot rise, So he, with glutted mind, remained Inert, and Christ arose and reigned. We raise the stone, we carve the solemn word, The sign of promise and the symbol grim; His voice and vice are in the land unheardâ Yet all is doubtful that relates to him. No more he twirls his smile to work us woe; We saw him put a fathom under sod: Flung down at lastâbut so was Aaron's rod. We hope he's dead, but only this we know: He does not smile. O glory be to God! STEPHEN DORSEY Flee, heedless stranger, from this spot accurst, Where rests in Satan an offender first In point of greatness, as in point of time, Of new-school rascals who proclaim their crime. Skilled with a frank loquacity to blab The dark arcana of each mighty grab, And famed for lying from his early youth, He sinned secure behind a veil of truth. Some lock their lips upon their deeds; some write A damning record and conceal from sight; Some, with a lust of speaking, die to quell it. His way to keep a secret was to tell it. MR. JUSTICE FIELD Here sleeps one of the greatest students Of jurisprudence. Nature endowed him with the gift Of juristhrift. All points of law alike he threw The dice to settle. Those honest cubes were loaded true With railway metal. GENERAL B. F. BUTLER Thy flesh to earth, thy soul to God, We gave, O gallant brother; And o'er thy grave the awkward squad Fired into one another! REPARATION Beneath this monument which rears its head, A giant note of admirationâdead, His life extinguished like a taper's flame, John Ericsson is lying in his fame. Behold how massive is the lofty shaft; How fine the product of the sculptor's craft; The gold how lavishly applied; the great Man's statue how impressive and sedate! Think what the cost was! It would ill become Our modesty to specify the sum; Suffice it that a fair per cent. we're giving Of what we robbed him of when he was living. DISINCORPORATED Of Corporal Tanner the head and the trunk Are here in unconsecrate ground duly sunk. His legs in the South claim the patriot's tear, But, stranger, you needn't be blubbering here. A KIT Here Ingalls, sorrowing, has laid The tools of his infernal tradeâ His pen and tongue. So sharp they grew, And such destruction from them flew, His hand was wounded when he wrote, And when he spoke he cut his throat. DISJUNCTUS Within this humble mausoleum Poor Guiteau's flesh you'll find. His bones are kept in a museum, And Tillman has his mind. A TRENCHER-KNIGHT Stranger, uncover; here you have in view The monument of Chauncey M. Depew, Eater and orator, the whole world round For feats of tongue and tooth alike renowned. Dining his way to eminence, he rowed With knife and fork up water-ways that flowed From lakes of favorâpulled with all his force And found each river sweeter than the source. Like rats, obscure beneath a kitchen floor, Gnawing and rising till obscure no more, He ate his way to eminence, and Fame Inscribes in gravy his immortal name. A trencher-knight, he, mounted on his belly, So spurred his charger that its sides were jelly. Grown desperate at last, it reared and threw him, And Indigestion, overtaking, slew him. A VICE-PRESIDENT Here the remains of Schuyler Colfax lie; Born, all the world knows when, and God knows why. In '71 he filled the public eye, In '72 he bade the world good-bye; In God's good time, with a protesting sigh, He came to life just long enough to die. A WASTED LIFE Of Morgan here lies the unspirited clay, Who secrets of Masonry swore to betray. He joined the great Order and studied with zeal The awful arcana he meant to reveal. At last in chagrin by his own hand he fellâ There was nothing to learn, there was nothing to tell. The Masons are said to have killed him. Not soâ Even a secret so foul, they're compelled to forego. THE SCRAP HEAP POESY Successive bards pursue Ambition's fire That shines, Oblivion, above thy mire. The latest mounts his predecessor's trunk, And sinks his brother ere himself is sunk. So die ingloriously Fame's Ã©lite, But dams of dunces keep the line complete. HOSPITALITY Why ask me, Gastrogogue, to dine, (Unless to praise your rascal wine) Yet never ask some luckless sinner Who needs, as I do not, a dinner? MAGNANIMITY âTo the will of the people we loyally bow!â That's the minority shibboleth now. O noble antagonists, answer me flatâ What would you do if you didn't do that? UNDERSTATED âI'm sorry I married,â says Upton Sinclair: âThe conjugal status is awful!â The devil's device, a delusion and snare.â Worse, far worse than thatâit is lawful! AN ATTORNEY-GENERAL Philander Knox!âI know him by the sound; His sleep, unlike his learning, is profound. No dreams of duty mar his loud repose, Nor strain the cobwebs tethering his nose, Which, roaring ever like the solemn sea, Proclaims to all the world that this is he. In thought a tortoise but in act a hare, Slow to decide and impotent to dare, Yet no important crisis he ignores, But sleeps upon it, and for actionâsnores. FINANCIAL NEWS Says Rockefeller: âMoney is not tight,â And, faith, I'm thinking that the man is right. If it were not, at least in morals, loose He hardly could command it for his use. ASPIRATION No man can truthfully say that he would not like to be President.â William C. Whitney. Lo! the wild rabbit, happy in the pride Of qualities to meaner beasts denied, Surveys the ass with reverence and fear, Adoring his superior length of ear, And says: âNo living creature, lean or fat, But wishes in his heart to be like That!â DEMOCRACY Let slaves and subjects with extolling psalms Before their sovereign execute salaams; The freeman scorns one idol to adoreâ Tom, Dick, and Harry and himself are four. AN ENEMY TO LAW AND ORDER A is defrauded of his land by B, Who's driven from the premises by C. D buys the place with coin of plundered E. âThat A's an Anarchist!â says F to G. FORESIGHT An âactors' cemetery!â Sure The devil never tires Of planning places to procure The sticks to feed his fires. A FAIR DIVISION Another Irish landlord gone to grass, Slain by the bullets of the tenant class! Pray, good agrarians, what wrong requires Such foul redress? Between you and the squires All Ireland's parted with an even handâ For you have all the ire, they all the land. A LACKING FACTOR âYou acted unwisely,â I cried, âas you see By the outcome.â He calmly eyed me: âWhen choosing the course of my action,â said he, âI had not the outcome to guide me.â THE POLITICIAN Let patriots manipulate The tiller of the Ship of State; Be mine the humble, useful toil To work the tiller of the soil. ELIHU ROOT Stoop to a dirty trick or low misdeed? What, bend him from his moral skies to it? No, no, not he! To serve his nature's need He may upon occasion rise to it. AN ERROR âI never have been able to determine Just how it is that the judicial ermine Is safely guarded from predacious vermin.â âIt is not so, my friend; though in a garret 'Tis kept in camphor, and you often air it, The vermin will get into it and wear it.â VANISHED AT COCK-CROW âI've found the secret of your charm,â I said, Expounding with complacency my guess. Alas! the charm, even as I named it, fled, For all its secret was unconsciousness. WOMAN Study good women and ignore the rest, For he best knows the sex who knows the best. A PARTISAN'S PROTEST O statesmen, what would you be at, With torches, flags and bands? You make me first throw up my hat, And then my hands. A BEQUEST TO MUSIC âLet music flourish!â So he said and died. Hark! when he's gone the minstrelsy begins: The symphonies ascend, a swelling tide, Melodious thunders fill the welkin wideâ The grand old lawyers, chinning on their chins! ONEIROMANCY I fell asleep and dreamed that I Was flung, like Vulcan, from the sky; Like him, was lamedâanother part: His leg was crippled, and my heart. I woke in time to see my love Conceal a letter in her glove. JULY FOURTH God said: âLet there be noise.â The dawning fire Of Independence gilded every spire. A PARADOX âIf life were not worth living,â said the preacher, â'Twould have in suicide one pleasant feature.â âAn error,â said the pessimist, âyou're making: What's not worth having cannot be worth taking.â REEDIFIED Lord of the Tempest, pray refrain From leveling this church again. Now in its doom, since so you've willed it, We acquiesce: but you'll rebuild it. A BULLETIN âLothario is very low,â So all the doctors tell. Nay, nay, not so,âhe will be, though, If ever he get well. AN INSCRIPTION For a Statue of Napoleon A conqueror as provident as brave, He robbed the cradle to supply the grave. His reign laid quantities of human dust: He fell upon the just and the unjust. AN ERRONEOUS ASSUMPTION Good for he's old? Ah, Youth, you do not dream How sweet the roses in the autumn seem! A CONSTRUCTOR I saw the devil. He was working freeâ A customs-house he builded by the sea. âWhy do you this?â The devil raised his head: âOf churches I have built enough,â he said. GOD COMPLIES âBy prayer see Megapomp restored,â Shouts Martext, pious creature. Yes, God by supplication bored From every droning preacher, Exclaimed: âSo be it, tiresome crew; But I've a crow to pick with you.â IN ARTICULO MORTIS The paper presented he solemnly signed, Gaspingâperhaps 'twas a jest he meant: âThis of a sound and disposing mind Is the last illwill and contestament.â THE DISCOVERERS My! how my fame rings out in ever zoneâ A thousand critics shouting: âHe's unknown!â UNEXPOUNDED On Evidence, on Deeds, on Bills, On Copyhold, on Loans, on Wills, Lawyers great books indite. The creaking of their busy quills I never heard on Right. THE EASTERN QUESTION Looking across the line, the Grecian said: âThis border I will stain a Turkey red.â The Moslem smiled serenely and replied: âNo Greek has ever for his country dyed.â While thus each patriot guarded his frontier The Powers stole the country in his rear. TWO TYPES Courageous fool!âthe peril's strength unknown. Courageous man!âso conscious of your own. TO A CRITIC OF TENNYSON Affronting fool, subdue your transient light; When Wisdom's dull dares Folly to be bright? If Genius stumble in the path to fame 'Tis decency in dunces to go lame. COOPERATION No more the swindler singly seeks his prey: To hunt in couples is the modern wayâ A rascal from the public to purloin, An honest man to hide away the coin. HUMILITY Great poets fire the world with fagots big That make a crackling racket, But I'm content with but a whispering twig To warm some single jacket. STRAINED RELATIONS Says England to Germany: âAfrica's ours.â Says Germany: âOurs, I opine.â Says Africa: âTell me, delectable Powers, What is it that ought to be mine?â EXONERATION When men at candidacy don't connive, From that suspicion if their friends would free 'em The teeth and nails with which they do not strive Should be exhibited in a museum. AFTER PORTSMOUTH Begirt with bombs that fall and flames that rise, The Tsar, bewildered, stares. âAlas,â he cries, âLife withholds joy and death denies release! And Roosevelt would have me think this peace.â A VOICE FROM PEKIN ââEmpress of Chinaâ! I nor rule nor reign: I wear the purple but to hide the chainâ Free only to hold back the open door For foreign devils drunk upon my floor.â A PIOUS RITE On Maunday Thursday, as was good and meet, The Emperor of Austria washed the feet Of twelve poor men to show how humble he For twenty minutes of the year could be. O Thou, who trackest tenants of the throne Through moral quagmires, make them wash their own. JUSTICE She jilted me. I madly cried: âThe grave at least can hold her!â Reflecting then that if she died 'Twould stop her growing older, I pitilessly sheathed the knife And sternly sentenced her to life! AT THE BEACH List, England, to our words of scorn For noblemen to title born! Yet be thine eyes awhile depressed, For one has turned his prow to-west, And we, to catch his landing-line, Are pickling all our shins in brine.

The man was so rude, That he made an attempt to kill! CONVERSELY There's grief in Belgrade, for no crown, it is said, Is found for King Peter in all of the town. How sad that he's lacking a crown for his head! How sweet were he lacking a head for his crown! A WARNING Cried Age to Youth: âAbate your speed!

PSYCHOGRAPHS Says Gerald Massey: âWhen I write, a band Of souls of the departed guides my hand.â How strange that poems cumbering our shelves, Penned by immortal parts, have none themselves! FOR WOUNDS O bear me, gods, to some enchanted isle Where woman's tears can antidote her smile. A LITERARY METHOD His âHoosier poemsâ Riley says he writes Upon an empty stomach.

      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME V BLACK BEETLES IN AMBER AVALON I dreamed I was dreaming one morn as I lay In a garden with flowers teemingâ On an island I lay, in a mystical bay, In the dream that I dreamed I was dreaming. The ghost of a scentâhad it followed me there From the place where I truly was resting? It filled like an anthem the aisles of the air, The presence of roses attesting. Yet I thought in the dream that I dreamed I dreamed That the place was all barren of rosesâ That it only seemed; and the place, I deemed, Was the Isle of Bedeviled Noses. Full many a seaman had testified How all who sailed near were enchanted, And landed to search (and in searching died) For the roses the Sirens had planted. For the Sirens were dead, and the billows boomed In the stead of their singing forever; But the roses bloomed on the graves of the doomed, Though man had discovered them never. I thought in my dream 'twas an idle tale, A delusion that mariners cherishedâ That the fragrance loading the conscious gale Was the ghost of a garden long perished. I said, âI will fly from this island of woes,â And acting on that decision, By that odor of rose I was led by the nose, For 'twas truly, ah! truly, Elysian. I ran, in my madness, to seek out the source Of the redolent riverâdirected By some supernatural, sinister force To a forest, dark, haunted, infected. And still as I threaded ('twas all in the dream That I dreamed I was dreaming) each turning There were many a scream and a sudden gleam Of eyes all uncannily burning! The leaves were all wet with a horrible dew That mirrored the red moon's crescent, And all shapes were fringed with a ghostly blue, Dim, wavering, phosphorescent. But the fragrance divine, coming strong and free, Led me on in my resolute seeking, Till!âah, joy!âI could see, on the limbs of a tree, Mine enemies hanging and reeking! CAIN Lord, shed Thy light upon his desert path, And gild his branded brow, that no man spill His forfeit life to balk Thy holy will That spares him for the ripening of wrath. Already, lo! the red sign is descried, To trembling jurors visibly revealed: The prison doors obediently yield, The baffled hangman flings the cord aside. Powell, the brother's blood that marks your trailâ Hark, how it cries against you from the ground, Like the far baying of the tireless hound. Faith! to your ear it is no nightingale. What signifies the date upon a stone? To-morrow you shall die if not to-day. What matter when the Avenger choose to slay? Or soon or late the Devil gets his own. Thenceforth through all eternity you'll hold No one advantage of the later death. Though you had granted Ralph another breath Would he to-day less silent lie and cold? Earth cares not, curst assassin, when you die; You never will be readier than now. Wear, in God's name, that mark upon your brow, And keep the life you purchased with a lie! ONE JUDGE Wallace, created on a noble plan To show us that a Judge can be a Man; Through moral mire exhaling mortal stench God-guided sweet and foot-clean to the Bench; In salutation here and sign I lift A hand as free as yours from lawless thrift, A heartâah, would I truly could proclaim My bosom lighted with so pure a flame! Alas, not love of justice moves my pen To praise, or to condemn, my fellow men. Good will and ill its busy point incite: I do but gratify them when I write. In palliation, though, I'd humbly state, I love the righteous and the wicked hate. So, sir, although we differ we agree, Our work alike from persecution free, And Heaven, approving you, consents to me. Take, therefore, from this not all useless hand The crown of honorânot in all the land One honest man dissenting from the choice, Nor in approval one Fred Crocker's voice! AN OBITUARIAN A newspaper Death-poet sat at his desk, Wrapped in appropriate gloom; His posture was pensive and picturesque, Like a raven charming a tomb. Enter a party a-drinking the cup Of sorrowâand likewise of woe: âSome harrowing poetry, Mister, whack up, All wrote in the key of O. âFor the angels have called my old woman hence From the strifeâwhere she fit mighty free. It's a nickel a line? Cond?n the expense! For wealth is now little to me.â The Bard of Mortality looked him through In the piercingest sort of a way: âIt is much to me though it's little to youâ I've taken a wife to-day.â So he twisted the tail of his mental cow And made her give down her flow. The grief of that bard was long-winded, somehowâ There was reams and reamses of woe. The widower man which had buried his wife Grew lily-like round each gill, For she turned in her grave and came back to life! Then he cruel ignored the bill. Then Sorrow she opened her gates a-wide, As likewise did also Woe, And the death-poet's song, as is heard inside, Is sang in the key of O. A COMMUTED SENTENCE Boruck and Waterman upon their grills In Hades lay, with many a sigh and groan, Hotly disputing, for each swore his own Were clearly keener than the other's ills. And truly each had much to boast ofâbone And sinew, muscle, tallow, nerve and skin, Blood in the vein and marrow in the shin, Teeth, eyes and other organs (for the soul Has all of these and even a wagging chin) All blazed and coruscated like a coal! For Lower Sacramento, you remember, Has trying weather, even in mid-December. Now this occurred in the far future. All Mankind had been a million ages dead, And each to her reward above had sped, Each to his punishment below,âI call That quite a just arrangement. As I said, Boruck and Waterman in warmest pain Crackled and sizzed with all their might and main. For, when on earth, they'd freed a scurvy host Of crooks from the State prison, who again Had robbed and ravaged the Pacific Coast And (such the felon's predatory nature) Even got themselves into the Legislature. So Waterman and Boruck lay and roared In Hades. It is true all other males Felt the like flames and uttered equal wails, But did not suffer them; whereas they bored Each one the other! But indeed my tale's Not getting on at all. They lay and browned Till Boruck (who long since his teeth had ground Away and spoke Gum Arabic and made Stump speeches even in praying) looked around And said to Bob's incinerated shade: âYour Excellency, this is mighty hard on The inventors of the unpardonable pardon.â The other soulâhis right hand all aflame, For 'twas with that he'd chiefly sinned, although His tongue, too, like a wick was working woe To the reserve of tallow in his frameâ Said, with a sputtering, uncertain flow, And with a gesture like a shaken torch: âYes, but I'm sure we'll not much longer scorch. Although this climate is not good for Hope, Whose joyous wing 'twould singe, I think the porch Of Hell we'll quit with a pacific slope. Last century I signified repentance And asked for commutation of our sentence.â Even as he spoke, the form of Satan loomed In sight, all crimson with reflection's fire, Like some tall tower or cathedral spire Touched by the dawn while all the earth is gloomed In mists and shadows of the night-time. âSire,â Said Waterman, his agitable wick Still sputtering, âwhat calls you back so quick? It scarcely was a century ago You left us.â âI have come to bring,â said Nick, âSt. Peter's answer (he is never slow In correspondence) to your application For pardonâpardon me!âfor commutation. âHe says that he's instructed to reply (And he has so instructed me) that sin Like yoursâand this poor gentleman's who's in For bad advice to youâcomes rather high; But since, apparently, you both begin To feel some pious promptings to the right, And fain would turn your faces to the light, Eternity seems all too long a term. So 'tis commuted to one-half. I'm quite Prepared, when that expires, to free the worm And quench the fire.â And, civilly retreating, He left them holding their protracted meeting. A LIFTED FINGER [The Chronicle did a great public service in whipping ? and his fellow-rascals out of office.âM. H. de Young's Newspaper.] What! you whip rascals?âyou, whose gutter blood Bears, in its dark, dishonorable flood, Enough of prison-birds' prolific germs To serve a whole eternity of terms? You, for whose back the rods and cudgels strove Ere yet the ax had hewn them from the grove? You, the De Young whose splendor bright and brave Is phosphorescence from another's graveâ Till now unknown, by any chance or luck, Even to the hearts at which you feebly struck? You whip a rascal out of office?âyou Whose leadless weapon once ignobly blew Its smoke in six directions to assert Your lack of appetite for other's dirt? Practice makes perfect: when for fame you thirst, Then whip a rascal. Whip a cripple first. Or, if for action you're less free than bold (Your palms both brimming with dishonest gold) Entrust the castigation that you've planned, As once before, to woman's idle hand. So in your spirit shall two pleasures join To slake the sacred thirst for blood and coin. Blood? Souls have blood, even as the body hath, And, spilled, 'twill fertilize the field of wrath. Lo! in a purple gorge of yonder hills, Where o'er a grave a bird its day-song stills, A woman's blood, through roses ever red, Mutely appeals for vengeance on your head. Slandered to death to serve a sordid end, She called you murderer and called me friend. Now, mark you, libeler, this course if you Dare to maintain, or rather to renew; If one short year's immunity has made You blink again the perils of your tradeâ The ghastly sequence of the maddened âknave,â The hot encounter and the colder grave; If the grim, dismal lesson you ignore While yet the stains are fresh upon your floor, And calmly march upon the fatal brink With eyes averted to your trail of ink, Counting unkind the services of those Who pull, to hold you back, your stupid nose, The day for you to die is not so far, Or, at the least, to live the thing you are! Pregnant with possibilities of crime, And full of felons for all coming time, Your blood's too precious to be lightly spilt In testimony to a venial guilt. Live to get whelpage and preserve a name No praise can sweeten and no lie unshame. Live to fulfill the vision that I see Down the dim vistas of the time to be: A dream of clattering beaks and burning eyes Of hungry ravens glooming all the skies; A dream of gleaming teeth and fÅtid breath Of jackals wrangling at the feast of death; A dream of broken necks and swollen tonguesâ The whole world's gibbets loaded with De Youngs! TWO DELEGATES In that fair city by the inland sea Where Blaine unhived his Presidential bee Frank Pixley's meeting with George Gorham sing, Celestial muse, and what events did spring From the encounter of those mighty sons Of thunder, and of slaughter, and of guns. Great Gorham first, his yearning tooth to sate And give him stomach for the day's debate, Entering a restaurant, with eager mien Demands an ounce of bacon and a bean. The trembling waiter, by the statesman's eye Smitten with terror, hastens to comply; Nor chairs nor tables can his speed retard, For famine's fixed and horrible regard He takes for menace. As he shaking flew, Lo! the portentous Pixley heaved in view! Before his yawned invisible the cell, Unheard, behind, the warden's footsteps fell. Thrice in convention rising to his feet, He thrice had been thrust back into his seat; Thrice had protested, been reminded thrice The nation had no need of his advice. Balked of his will to set the people right, His soul was gloomy though his hat was white. So fierce his mien, with provident accord The waiters swarmed him, thinking him a lord. He spurned them, roaring grandly to their chief: âGive me (Fred Crocker pays) a leg of beef!â His wandering eye's deluminating flame Fell upon Gorham and the crisis came! For Pixley scowled and darkness filled the room Till Gorham's flashing orbs dispelled the gloom. The patrons of the place, by fear dismayed, Sprang to the street and left their scores unpaid. So, when Jove thunders and his lightnings gleam To sour the milk and curdle, too, the cream, And storm-clouds gather, o'er the shadowed hill, The ass forsakes his hay, the pig his swill. Hotly the heroes now fell toâtheir breath Came short and hard, as in the throes of death. They clenched their hands, their weapons brandished high, Cut, stabbed, and hewed, nor uttered any cry, But gnashed their teeth and struggled on! In brief, One ate his bacon, t'other one his beef. MATTER FOR GRATITUDE [Especially should we be thankful for having escaped the ravages of the yellow scourge by which our neighbors have been so sorely afflicted.âGovernor Stoneman's Thanksgiving Proclamation.] Be pleased, O Lord, to take a people's thanks That Thine avenging sword has spared our ranksâ That thou hast parted from our lips the cup And forced our neighbors' lips to drink it up. Father of Mercies, with a heart contrite We thank Thee that Thou goest south to smite, And sparest San Francisco's loins, to crack Thy lash on Hermosillo's bleeding backâ That o'er our homes Thine awful angel spread A friendly wing, and Guaymas weeps instead. We praise Thee, God, that Yellow Fever here His horrid banner has not dared to rear, Consumption's jurisdiction to contest, Her dagger deep in every second breast! Catarrh and Asthma and Congestive Chill Attest Thy bounty and perform Thy will. These native messengers obey Thy callâ They summon singly, but they summon all. Not, as in Mexico's impested clime, Can Yellow Jack commit recurring crime. We thank Thee that Thou killest all the time. Thy tender mercies, Father, never end: Upon all heads Thy blessings still descend, Though their forms vary. Here the sown seeds yield Abundant grain that whitens all the fieldâ There the smit corn stands barren on the plain, Thrift reaps but straw and Famine gleans in vain. Here the fat priest to the contented king Points to the harvest and the people singâ There mothers eat their offspring. Well, at least Thou hast provided offspring for the feast. An earthquake here rolls harmless through the land, And Thou art good because the chimneys standâ There templed cities sink into the sea, And damp survivors, shrieking as they flee, Skip to the hills and hold a celebration In honor of Thy wise discrimination. O God, forgive them all, from Stoneman down, Thy smile who construe and expound Thy frown, And fall with saintly grace upon their knees To render thanks when Thou dost only sneeze. THREE KINDS OF A ROGUE I Sharon, ambitious of immortal shame, Fame's dead-wall daubed with his illustrious nameâ Served in the Senate, for our sins, his time, Each word a folly and each vote a crime; Law for our governance well skilled to make By knowledge gained in study how to break; Yet still by the presiding eye ignored, Which only sought him when too loud he snored. Auspicious thunder!âwhen he woke to vote He stilled his own, to cut his country's, throat; That rite performed, fell off again to sleep, While statesmen ages dead awoke to weep! For sedentary service all unfit, By lying long disqualified to sit, Wasting below as he decayed aloft, His seat grown harder as his brain grew soft, He left the hall he could not bring away, And grateful millions blessed the happy day! Whate'er contention in that hall is heard, His sovereign State has still the final word: For disputatious statesmen when they roar Startle the ancient echoes of his snore, Which from their dusty nooks expostulate And close with stormy clamor the debate. To low melodious thunders then they fade; Their murmuring lullabies all ears invade; Peace takes the Chair; the portal Silence keeps; No motion stirs the dark Lethean deepsâ Washoe has spoken and the Senate sleeps. II Lo! the new Sharon with a new intent, Making no laws, but keen to circumvent The laws of Nature (since he can't repeal) That break his failing body on the wheel. As Tantalus again and yet again The elusive wave endeavors to restrain, To slake his awful thirst, so Sharon tries To purchase happiness that age denies; Obtains the shadow, but the substance goes, And hugs the thorn, but cannot keep the rose; For Dead Sea fruits bids prodigally, eats, And then, with tardy reformationâcheats. Alert his faculties as three score years And four score vices will permit, he nearsâ Dicing with Deathâthe finish of the game, And curses still his candle's wasting flame, The narrow circle of whose feeble glow Dims and diminishes at every throw. Moments his losses, pleasures are his gains, Which even in his grasp revert to pains. The joy of graspingâthat alone remains. III Ring up the curtain and the play protract! Behold our Sharon in his last mad act. With man long warring, quarreling with God, He crouches now beneath a woman's rod Predestined for his back while yet it lay Closed in an acorn which, one luckless day, He stole, unconscious of its fÅtal twig, From the scant garner of a sightless pig. With bleeding shoulders pitilessly scored, He bawls more lustily than once he snored. The sympathetic âComstocksâ droop to hear, And Carson river sheds a viscous tear Which sturdy tumble-bugs assail amain, With ready thrift, and urge along the plain. The jackass rabbit sorrows as he lopes; The sage-brush glooms along the mountain slopes; In rising clouds the poignant alkali, Tearless itself, makes everybody cry. âWashoe canariesâ on the Geiger Grade Subdue the singing of their cavalcade, And, wiping with their ears the tears unshed, Grieve for their family's unlucky head. Virginia City intermits her trade And well-clad strangers walk her streets unflayed. Nay, all Nevada ceases work to weep, And the recording angel goes to sleep. But in his dreams his goose-quill's creaking fount Augments the debits in the long account. And still the continents and oceans ring With royal torments of the Silver King! Incessant bellowings fill all the earth, Mingled with inextinguishable mirth. He roars, men laugh, Nevadans weep, beasts howl, Plash the affrighted fish, and shriek the fowl! With monstrous din their blended thunders rise, Peal upon peal, and blare along the skies, Startle in hell the Sharons as they groan, And shake the splendors of the great white throne! Still roaring outward through the vast profound, The spreading circles of receding sound Pursue each other in a failing race To the cold confines of eternal space; There break and die along that awful shore Which God's own eyes have never dared exploreâ Dark, fearful, formless, nameless evermore! Look to the west! Against yon steely sky Lone Mountain rears its holy cross on high. About its base the meek-faced dead are laid To share the benediction of its shade. With crossed white hands, shut eyes and formal feet, Their nights are innocent, their days discreet. Sharon, some years, perchance, remain of lifeâ Of vice and greed, vulgarity and strife; And thenâGod speed the day if such His willâ You'll lie among the dead you help to kill, And be in good society at last, Your purse unsilvered and your face unbrassed. A MAN Pennoyer, Governor of Oregon, Casting to South his eye across the bourne Of his dominion (where the Palmiped, With leathers 'twixt his toes, paddles his marsh, Amphibious) saw a rising cloud of hats, And heard a faint, far sound of distant cheers Below the swell of the horizon. âLo,â Cried one, âthe President! the President!â All footed webwise then took up the wordâ The hill tribes and the tribes lacustrineâall The folk riparian and littoral, Cried with one voice: âThe President! He comes!â And some there were who flung their headgear up In emulation of the Southern mob, While some, more soberly disposed, stood still And silently had fits; and others made Such reverent genuflexions as they could, Having that climate in their bones. Then spake The Court Dunce, humbly, as became him: âSire, If thou, as heretofore thou hast, wilt deign To reap advantage of a fool's advice By action ordered after nature's way, As in thy people manifest (for still Stupidity's the only wisdom) thou Wilt get thee straight unto to the border land To mark the President's approach with such Due, decent courtesy as it shall seem We have in custom the best warrant for.â Pennoyer, Governor of Oregon, Eying the storm of hats which darkened all The Southern sky, and hearing far hurrahs Of an exulting people, answered not. Then some there were who fell upon their knees, And some upon their Governor, and sought Each in his way, by blandishment or force, To gain his action to their end. âBehold,â They said, âthy brother Governor to South Met him even at the gateway of his realm, Crook-kneed, magnetic-handed and agrin, Backed like a rainbowâall things done in form Of due observance and respect. Shall we Alone of all his servitors refuse Swift welcome to our master and our lord?â Pennoyer, Governor of Oregon, Answered them not, but turned his back to them And as if speaking to himself, the while He started to retire, said: âHe be damned!â To that High Place o'er Portland's central block, Where the Recording Angel stands to view The sinning world, nor thinks to move his feet Aside and look below, came flocking up Inferior angels, all aghast, and cried: âPennoyer, Governor of Oregon, Has said, O what an awful word!âtoo bad To be by us repeated!â âYes, I know,â Said the superior birdââI heard it too, And have already booked it. Pray observe.â Splitting the giant tome, whose covers fell Apart, o'ershadowing to right and left The Eastern and the Western world, he showed The newly written entry, black and bigâ Upon the credit side of thine account, Pennoyer, Governor of Oregon. Y? FOE TO CATHAYE O never an oathe sweares he, And never a pig-taile jerkes; With a brick-battle he ne lurkes For to buste y? crust, perdie, Of y? man from over sea, A-synging as he werkes. For he knows ful well, y? youth, A tricke of exceeding worth: And he plans withouten ruth A conflagration's birth! SAMUEL SHORTRIDGE Like a worn mother he attempts in vain To still the unruly Crier of his brain: The more he rocks the cradle of his chin, The more uproarious grows the brat within. AT A âNATIONAL ENCAMPMENTâ You're grayer than one would have thought you: The climate you have over there In the East has apparently brought you Disorders affecting the hair, Whichâpardon meâseems a bit spare. You'll not take offence at my giving Expression to notions like these. You might have been stronger if living Out here in our sanative breeze. It's unhealthy here for disease. No, I'm not so plump as a pullet, But that's the old wound, you see. Remember my paunching a bullet?â And how that it didn't agree With?âwell, honest hardtack for me. Just pass me the wineâI've a helly And horrible kind of drouth! When a fellow has that in his belly Which didn't go in at his mouth He's hotter than all Down South! Great Scott! what a nasty day that wasâ When every galoot in our crack Division who didn't lie flat was Dissuaded from further attack By the bullet's felicitous whack. 'Twas there that our major slept under Some cannon of ours on the crest, Till they woke him by stilling their thunder, And he cursed them for breaking his rest, And died in the midst of his jest. That nightâit was late in Novemberâ The dead seemed uncommonly chill To the touch; and a chap I remember Who took it exceedingly ill When I dragged myself over his bill. Well, comrades, I'm off nowâgood morning. Your talk is as pleasant as pie, But, pardon me, one word of warning: Speak little and seldom, say I. That's my way. God bless you. Good-bye. THEOSOPHISTRY Says Anderson, Theosophist: âAmong the many that exist In modern halls, Some lived in ancient Egypt's clime, And in their childhood saw the prime Of Karnak's walls.â Ah, Anderson, if that is true 'Tis my conviction, sir, that you Are one of those That once resided by the Nileâ Peer to the Sacred Crocodile, Heir to his woes. My judgment is, the Holy Cat Mews through your larynx (and your hat) These many years. Through you the Hallowed Onion brings Its melancholy sense of things, And moves to tears. In you the Bull Divine again Bellows and paws the dusty plain, To nature true. I challenge not his ancient hate, But, lowering my knurly pate, Lock horns with you. And though Reincarnation prove A creed too stubborn to remove, And all your school Of Theosophs I cannot scare,â All the more earnestly I swear That you're a fool! You'll say that this is mere abuse Without, in fraying you, a use. That's plain to see With only half an eye. Come, now, Be fair, be fair,âconsider how It eases me. AZRAEL The moon in the field of the keel-plowed main Was watching the growing tide; A luminous peasant was driving his wain, And he offered my soul a ride. But I nourished a sorrow uncommonly tall, And I fixed him fast with my eye. âO peasant,â I sang with a dying fall, âGo leave me to sing and to die.â The water was weltering round my feet, As prone on the beach they lay. I chanted my death-song loud and sweet: âKioodle, ioodle, iay!â Then I heard the swish of erecting ears Which caught that enchanting strain. The ocean was swollen with storms of tears That fell from the shining swain. âO poet,â leapt he to the soaken strand, âThat ravishing song would make The devil a saint!â He held out his hand And solemnly added: âShake.â We shook. âI crave a victim, you see,â He saidââyou came hither to die.â The Angel of Death, 'twas he! 'twas he! And the victim he crove was I! 'Twas I, Fred Emerson Brooks, the bard; And he knocked me on the head. O Lord! I thought it uncommonly hard, For I didn't want to be dead. âYou'll sing no worser for that,â said he And he drove with my soul away. O death-song singers, be warned by me, Kioodle, ioodle, iay! COMPETITION The Seraphs came to Christ and said: âBehold! The man, presumptuous and overbold, Who boasted that his mercy could excel Thine own, is dead and on his way to Hell.â Gravely the Savior asked: âWhat did he do To make his impious assertion true?â âHe was a Governor, releasing all The vilest felons ever held in thrall. No other mortal, since the dawn of time, Has ever pardoned such a mass of crime!â Christ smiled benignly on the Seraphim: âYet I am victor, for I pardon him.â A VISION OF DOOM I stood upon a hill. The setting sun Was crimson with a curse and a portent, And scarce his angry ray lit up the land That lay below, whose lurid gloom appeared Freaked with a moving mist, which, reeking up From dim tarns hateful with some horrid ban, Took shapes forbidden and without a name. Gigantic night-birds, rising from the reeds With cries discordant, startled all the air, And bodiless voices babbled in the gloomâ The ghosts of blasphemies long ages stilled, And shrieks of women, and men's curses. All These visible shapes, and sounds no mortal ear Had ever heard, some spiritual sense Interpreted, though brokenly; for I Was haunted by a consciousness of crime, Some giant guilt, but whose I knew not. All These things malign, by sight and sound revealed, Were sin-begotten; that I knewâno moreâ And that but dimly, as in dreadful dreams The sleepy senses babble to the brain Imperfect witness. As I stood, a voice, But whence it came I knew not, cried aloud Some words to me in a forgotten tongue, Yet straight I knew me for a ghost forlorn, Returned from the illimited inane. Again, but in a language that I knew, As in reply to something which in me Had shaped itself a thought, but found no words, It spake from the dread mystery about: âImmortal shadow of a mortal soul That perished with eternity, attend. What thou beholdest is as void as thou: The shadow of a poet's dreamâhimself As thou, his soul as thine, long dead, But not like thine outlasted by its shade. His dreams alone survive eternity As pictures in the unsubstantial void. Excepting thee and me (and we because The poet wove us in his thought) remains Of nature and the universe no part Nor vestige but the poet's dreams. This dread, Unspeakable land about thy feet, with all Its desolation and its terrorsâlo! 'Tis but a phantom world. So long ago That God and all the angels since have died That poet livedâyourself long deadâhis mind Filled with the light of a prophetic fire, And standing by the Western sea, above The youngest, fairest city in the world, Named in another tongue than his for one Ensainted, saw its populous domain Plague-smitten with a nameless shame. For there Red-handed murder rioted; and there The people gathered gold, nor cared to loose The assassin's fingers from the victim's throat, But said, each in his vile pursuit engrossed: âAm I my brother's keeper? Let the Law Look to the matter.â But the Law did not. And there, O pitiful! the babe was slain Within its mother's breast and the same grave Held babe and mother; and the people smiled, Still gathering gold, and said: âThe Law, the Law.â Then the great poet, touched upon the lips With a live coal from Truth's high altar, raised His arms to heaven and sang a song of doomâ Sang of the time to be, when God should lean Indignant from the Throne and lift His hand, And that foul city be no more!âa tale, A dream, a desolation and a curse! No vestige of its glory should survive In fact or memory: its people dead, Its site forgotten, and its very name Disputed.â âWas the prophecy fulfilled?â The sullen disc of the declining sun Was crimson with a curse and a portent, And scarce his angry ray lit up the land Freaked with a moving mist, which, reeking up From dim tarns hateful with a horrid ban, Took shapes forbidden and without a name. And bodiless voices babbled in the gloom. But not to me came any voice again; And, covering my face with thin, dead hands, I wept, and woke, and cried aloud to God! GENESIS God said: âLet there be Man,â and from the clay Adam came forth and, thoughtful, walked away. The matrix whence his body was obtained, An empty man-shaped cavity, remained All unregarded from that early time Till in a modern storm it filled with slime. Now Satan, envying his Master's power To make the meat himself could but devour, Strolled to the place and, standing by the pool, Exerted all his will to make a fool. A miracle!âfrom out that ancient hole Rose Morehouse, lacking nothing but a soul. âTo give him that I've not the power divine,â Said Satan, sadly, âbut I'll lend him mine.â He breathed it into him, a vapor black, And to this day has never got it back. RELIGIOUS PROGRESS [Every religion is important. When men rise above existing conditions a new religion comes in, and it is better than the old one. âProfessor Howison.] Professor dear, I think it queer That all these good religions ('Twixt you and me, some two or three Are schemes for plucking pigeons)â I mean 'tis strange that every change Our poor minds to unfetter Entails a new religionâtrue As t' other one, and better. From each in turn the truth we learn, That wood or flesh or spirit May justly boast it rules the roast Until we cease to fear it. Nay, once upon a time long gone Man worshiped Cat and Lizard: His God he'd find in any kind Of beast, from a to izzard. When risen above his early love Of dirt and blood and slumber, He pulled down these vain deities, And made one out of lumber. âFar better that than even a cat,â The Howisons all shouted; âWhen God is wood religion's good!â But one poor cynic doubted. âA timber Godâthat's very odd!â Said Progress, and invented The simple plan to worship Man, Who, kindly soul! consented. But soon our eye we lift asky, Our vows all unregarded, And find (at least so says the priest) The Truthâand Man's discarded. Along our line of march recline Dead gods devoid of feeling; And thick about each sun-cracked lout Dried Howisons are kneeling. THE FALL OF MISS LARKIN Hear me sing of Sally Larkin who, I'd have you understand, Played accordions as well as any lady in the land; And I've often heard it stated that her fingering was such That Professor Schweinenhauer was enchanted with her touch, And that beasts were so affected when her apparatus rang That they dropped upon their haunches and deliriously sang. This I know from testimony, though a critic, I opine, Needs an ear that is dissimilar in some respects to mine. She could sing, too, like a jaybird, and they say all eyes were wet When Sally and the ranch-dog were performing a duetâ Which I take it is a song that has to be so loudly sung As to overtax the strength of any single human lung. That, at least, would seem to follow from the tale I have to tell, Which (I've told you how she flourished) is how Sally Larkin fell. One day there came to visit Sally's dad as sleek and smart A chap as ever wandered there from any foreign part. Though his gentle birth and breeding he did not at all obtrude It was somehow whispered round he was a simon-pure Dude. Howsoe'er that may have been, it was conspicuous to see That he was a real Gent of an uncommon high degree. That Sally cast her tender and affectionate regards On this exquisite creation was, of course, upon the cards; But he didn't seem to notice, and was variously blind To her many charms of person and the merits of her mind, And preferred, I grieve to say it, to play poker with her dad, And acted in a manner that in general was bad. One eveningâ't was in summerâshe was holding in her lap Her accordion, and near her stood that melancholy chap, Leaning up against a pillar with his lip in grog imbrued, Thinking, maybe, of that ancient land in which he was a Dude. Now Sally, who was melancholy too, began to hum And elongate the accordion with a preluding thumb. Then sighs of amorosity she painfully exhaled, And her music apparatus sympathetically wailed. âIn the gloaming, O my darling!â rose that wild impassioned strain, And her eyes were fixed on his with an intensity of pain, Till the ranch-dog from his kennel at the postern gate came round, And going into session strove to magnify the sound. He lifted up his spirit till the gloaming rang and rang With the song that to his darling he impetuously sang! Then that musing youth, recalling all his soul from other scenes, Where his fathers all were Dudes and his mothers all Dudines, From his lips removed the beaker and politely, o'er the grog, Said: âMiss Larkin, please be quiet: you will interrupt the dog.â A RENDEZVOUS Nightly I put up this humble petition: âForgive me, O Father of Glories, My sins of commission, my sins of omission, My sins of the Mission Dolores!â YORICK Hard by an excavated street one sat In solitary session on the sand; And ever and anon he spake and spat And spake againâa yellow skull in hand, To which that retrospective Pioneer Addressed the few remarks that follow here: âWho are you? Did you come âder blains agross,â Or âHorn aroundtâ? In days o' '49 Did them thar eye-holes see the Southern Cross From the Antar'tic Sea git up an' shine? Or did you drive a bull team âall the way From Pike,â with Mr. Joseph Bowers?âsay! âWas you in Frisco when the water came Up to Montgum'ry street? and do you mind The time when Peters run the faro gameâ Jim Peters from old Mississipâbehind Wells Fargo's, where he subsequent was bust By Sandy, as regards both bank and crust? âI wonder was you here when Casey shot James King o' William? And did you attend The neck-tie dance ensuin'? I did not, But j'ined the rush to Go Creek with my friend Ed'ard McGowan; for we was resolved In sech diversions not to be involved. âMaybe I knowed you; seems to me I've seed Your face afore. I don't forget a face, But names I disrememberâI'm that breed Of owls. I'm talking some'at into space, An' maybe my remarks is too derned free, Seein' your name is unbeknown to me. âTher' was a time, I reckon, when I knowed Nigh onto every dern galoot in town. That was as late as '50. Now she's growed Surprisin'! Yes, me an' my pardner, Brown, Was wide acquainted. If ther' was a cuss We didn't know, the cause wasâhe knowed us. âMaybe you had that claim adjoinin' mine Up thar in Calaveras. Was it you To which Long Mary took a mighty shine, An' throwed squar' off on Jake the Kangaroo? I guess if she could see ye now she'd take Her chance o' happiness along o' Jake. âYou ain't so purty now as you was then: Yer eyes is nothin' but two prospect holes, An' women which are hitched to better men Would hardly for sech glances damn their souls, As Lengthie did. By God! I hope it's you, Forâ (kicks the skull) âI'm Jake the Kangaroo.â STANFORD'S WELCOME âO son of mine age, these eyes lose their fire: Be eyes, I pray, to thy dying sire.â âO father, fear not, for mine eyes are brightâ I read through a millstone at dead of night.â âMy son, O tell me, who are those men, Rushing, like pigs to the feeding-pen?â âWelcomers they of a statesman grand. They'll shake, and then they will pocket, his hand.â âSagacious youth with the wondrous eye, They seem to throw up their headgear. Why?â âBecause they've thrown up their hands until, O, They're so tired!âand dinners they've none to throw.â âMy son, my son, though dull are mine ears, I hear a great sound like the people's cheers.â âHe's thanking them, father, with tears in his eyes, For giving him lately that fine surprise.â âMy memory fails as I near mine end; How did they astonish their grateful friend?â âBy letting him buy, like apples or oats, With that which has made him so good, the votes Which make him so wise and grand and great. Now, father, please die, for 'tis growing late.â POSTERITY'S AWARD I'd long been dead, but I returned to earth. Some small affairs posterity was making A mess of, and I came to see that worth Received its dues. I'd hardly finished waking, The grave-mould still upon me, when my eye Perceived a statue standing straight and high. 'Twas a colossal figureâbronze and goldâ Nobly designed, in attitude commanding. A toga from its shoulders, fold on fold, Fell to the pedestal on which 'twas standing. Nobility it had and splendid grace, And all it should have hadâexcept a face! It showed no features: not a trace nor sign Of any eyes or nose could be detectedâ On the smooth oval of its front no line Where sites for mouths are commonly selected. All blank and blind its faulty head it reared. Let this be said: 'twas generously eared. Seeing these things, I straight began to guess For whom this mighty image was intended. âThe head,â I cried, âis Upton's, and the dress Is Parson Bartlett's own. True, his cloak ended Flush with his lowest vertebra, but no Sane sculptor ever made a toga so.â Then on the pedestal these words I read: âErected Eighteen Hundred Ninety-sevenâ (Saint Christofer! how fast the time had sped! Of course it naturally does in Heaven) âTo?â (here a blank space for the name began) âThe Nineteenth Century's Great Foremost Man!â âCompleted,â the inscription ended, âin The Year Three Thousandââwhich was just arriving. By Jove! thought I, 'twould make the founders grin To learn whose fame so long has been survivingâ To read the name posterity will place In that blank void, and view the finished face. Even as I gazed, the year Three Thousand came, And then by acclamation all the people Decreed whose was our century's best fame; Then scaffolded the statue like a steeple, To make the likeness; and the name was sunk Deep in the pedestal's metallic trunk. Whose was it? Gentle reader, pray excuse The seeming rudeness, but I can't consent to Be so forehanded with important news. 'Twas neither yours nor mineâlet that content you, If not, the name I must surrender, which, Upon a dead man's word, was Deacon Fitch! AN ART CRITIC Ira P. Rankin, you've a nasal nameâ I'll sound it through âthe speaking-trump of fame,â And wondering nations, hearing from afar The brazen twang of its resounding jar, Shall say: âThese bards are an uncommon classâ They blow their noses with a tube of brass!â So you object to Cytherea! Do, The picture was not painted, sir, for you! Your mind to gratify and taste address, The masking dove had been a dove the less. Provincial censor! all untaught in art, With mind indecent and indecent heart, Do you not knowânay, why should I explain? Instruction, argument alike were vainâ I'll show you reasons when you show me brain. THE SPIRIT OF A SPONGE I dreamed one night that Stephen Massett died, And for admission up at Heaven applied. âWho are you?â asked St. Peter. Massett said: âJeems Pipes, of Pipesville.â Peter bowed his head, Opened the gates and said: âI'm glad to know you, And wish we'd something better, sir, to show you.â âDon't mention it,â said Stephen, looking bland, And was about to enter, hat in hand, When from a cloud below such fumes arose As tickled tenderly his conscious nose. He paused, replaced his hat upon his head, Turned back and to the saintly warden said, O'er his already sprouting wings: âI swear I smell some broiling going on down there!â So Massett's paunch, attracted by the smell, Followed his nose and found a place in Hell. ORNITHANTHROPOS âLet John P. Irish rise!â the edict rang As when Creation into being sprang! Nature, not clearly understanding, tried To make a bird that on the air could ride. But naught could baffle the creative planâ Despite her efforts 'twas almost a man. Yet he had risenâto the bird a twinâ Had she but fixed a wing upon his chin. TO E. S. SALOMON, Who in a Memorial Day oration protested bitterly against decorating the graves of Confederate dead. What! Salomon! such words from you, Who call yourself a soldier? Well, The Southern brother where he fell Slept all your base oration through. Alike to himâhe cannot know Your praise or blame: as little harm Your tongue can do him as your arm A quarter-century ago. The brave respect the brave. The brave Respect the dead; but youâyou draw That ancient blade, the ass's jaw, And shake it o'er a hero's grave. Are you not he who makes to-day A merchandise of old renown Which he persuades this easy town He won in battle far away? Nay, those the fallen who revile Have ne'er before the living stood And stoutly made their battle good And greeted danger with a smile. What if the dead whom still you hate Were wrong? Are you so surely right? We know the issues of the fightâ The sword is but an advocate. Men live and die, and other men Arise with knowledges diverse: What seemed a blessing seems a curse, And Now is still at odds with Then. The years go on, the old comes back To mock the newâbeneath the sun Is nothing new; ideas run Recurrent in an endless track. What most we censure, men as wise Have reverently practised; nor Will future wisdom fail to war On principles we dearly prize. We do not knowâwe can but deem, And he is loyalest and best Who takes the light full on his breast And follows it throughout the dream. The broken light, the shadows wideâ Behold the battle-field displayed! God save the vanquished from the blade, The victor from the victor's pride! If, Salomon, the blessed dew That falls upon the Blue and Gray Is powerless to wash away The sin of differing from you, Remember how the flood of years Has rolled across the erring slain; Remember, too, the cleansing rain Of widows' and of orphans' tears. The dead are deadâlet that atone: And though with equal hand we strew The blooms on saint and sinner too, Yet God will know to choose his own. The wretch, whate'er his life and lot, Who does not love the harmless dead With all his heart and all his headâ May God forgive him, I shall not. When, Salomon, you come to quaff The Darker Cup with meeker face, I, loving you at last, shall trace Upon your tomb this epitaph: âDraw near, ye generous and braveâ Kneel round this monument and weep For one who tried in vain to keep A flower from a soldier's grave.â DENNIS KEARNEY Your influence, my friends, has gathered headâ To east and west its tides encroaching spread. There'll be, on all God's fool-stool, when they meet, No clean spot left for Him to set His feet. FINIS ÃTERNITATIS Strolling at sunset in my native land, With fruits and flowers thick on either hand, I crossed a Shadow flung athwart my way, Emerging on a waste of rock and sand. âThe apples all are gone from here,â I said, âThe roses perished and their spirits fled. I will go back.â A voice cried out: âThe man Is risen who eternally was dead!â I turned and saw an angel standing there, Newly descended from the heights of air. Sweet-eyed compassion filled his face, his hands A naked sword and golden trumpet bare. âNay, 'twas not death, the shadow that I crossed,â I said. âIts chill was but a touch of frost. It made me gasp, but quickly I came through, With breath recovered ere it scarce was lost.â 'Twas the same land! Remembered mountains thrust Grayed heads asky, and every dragging gust, In ashen valleys where my sons had reaped, Stirred in familiar river-beds the dust. Some heights, where once the traveler was shown The youngest and the proudest city known, Lifted smooth ridges in the steely lightâ Bleak, desolate acclivities of stone. Where I had worshiped at my father's tomb, Within a massive temple's awful gloom, A jackal slunk along the naked rock, Affrighted by some prescience of doom. Man's vestiges were nowhere to be found, Save one brass mausoleum on a mound (I knew it well) spared by the artist Time To emphasize the desolation round. Into the stagnant sea the sullen sun Sank behind bars of crimson, one by one. âEternity's at hand!â I cried aloud. âEternity,â the angel said, âis done. âFor man is ages dead in every zone; The angels all are dead but I alone; The devils, too, are cold enough at last, And God lies dead before the great white throne! â'Tis foreordained that I bestride the shore When all are gone (as Gabriel did before, When I had throttled the last man alive) And swear Eternity shall be no more.â âO AzraelâO Prince of Death, declare Why conquered I the grave?â I cried. âWhat rare, Conspicuous virtues won this boon for me?â âYou've been revived,â he said, âto hear me swear.â âThen let me creep again beneath the grass, And knock you at yon pompous tomb of brass. If ears are what you want, Charles Crocker's thereâ Betwixt the greatest ears, the greatest ass.â He rapped, and while the hollow echoes rang, Out at the door a curst hyena sprang And fled! Said Azrael: âHis soul's escaped,â And closed the brazen portal with a bang. THE VETERAN John Jackson, once a soldier bold, Hath still a martial feeling; So, when he sees a foe, behold! He charges himâwith stealing. He cares not how much ground to-day He gives for men to doubt him; He's used to giving ground, they say, Who lately fought withâout him. When, for the battle to be won, His gallantry was needed, They say each time a loaded gun Went offâso, likewise, he did. And when discharged (for war's a sport So hot he had to leave it) He made a very loud report, But no one did believe it. AN âEXHIBITâ Goldenson hanged! Well, Heaven forbid That I should smile above him: Though truth to tell, I never did Exactly love him. It can't be wrong, though, to rejoice That his unpleasing capers Are ended. Silent is his voice In all the papers. No longer he's a show: no more, Bear-like, his den he's walking. No longer can he hold the floor When I'd be talking. The laws that govern jails are bad If such displays are lawful. The fate of the assassin's sad, But ours is awful! What! shall a wretch condemned to die In shame upon the gibbet Be set before the public eye As an âexhibitâ?â His looks, his actions noted down, His words, if light or solemn, And all this hawked about the townâ So much a column? The press, of course, will publish news However it may get it; But blast the sheriff who'll abuse His powers to let it! Nay, this is not ingratitude; I'm no reporter, truly, Nor yet an editor. I'm rudeâ Perhaps unrulyâ Because I burn with shame and rage Beyond my power of telling To see assassins in a cage And keepers yelling. âWalk up! Walk up!â the showman cries: âObserve the lion's poses, His stormy mane, his glooming eyes, Hisâhold your noses!â How long, O Lord, shall Law and Right Be mocked for gain or glory, And angels weep as they recite The shameful story? THE TRANSMIGRATIONS OF A SOUL What! Pixley, must I hear you call the roll Of all the vices that infest your soul? Was't not enough that lately you did bawl Your money-worship in the ears of all? Still must you crack your brazen cheek to tell That though a miser you're a sot as well? Still must I hear how low your taste has sunkâ From getting money down to getting drunk? Who worships money, damning all beside, And shows his callous knees with pious pride, Speaks with half-knowledge, for no man e'er scorns His own possessions, be they coins or corns. You've money, neighbor; had you gentle birth You'd know, as now you never can, its worth. You've money; learning is beyond your scope, Deaf to your envy, stubborn to your hope. But if upon your undeserving head Science and letters had their glory shed; If in the cavern of your skull the light Of knowledge shone where now eternal night Breeds the blind, poddy, vapor-fatted naughts Of cerebration that you think are thoughtsâ Black bats in cold and dismal corners hung That squeak and gibber when you move your tongueâ You would not write, in Avarice's defense, A senseless eulogy on lack of sense, Nor show your eagerness to sacrifice All noble virtues to one loathsome vice. You've money; if you'd manners too you'd shame To boast your weakness or your baseness name. Appraise the things you have, but measure not The things denied to your unhappy lot. He values manners lighter than a cork Who combs his beard at table with a fork, Hare to seek sin and tortoise to forsake, The laws of taste condemn you to the stake To expiate, where all the world may see, The crime of growing old disgracefully. Distinction, learning, birth and manners, too, All that distinguishes a man from you, Pray damn at will: all shining virtues gain An added luster from a rogue's disdain. But spare the young that proselyting sin, A toper's apotheosis of gin. If not our young, at least our pigs may claim Exemption from the spectacle of shame! Are you not he who lately out of shape Blew a brass trumpet to denounce the grape?â Who led the brave teetotalers afield And slew your leader underneath your shield?â Swore that no man should drink unless he flung Himself across your body at the bung?â Who vowed if you'd the power you would fine The Son of God for making water wine? All trails to odium you tread and boast, Yourself enamored of the dirtiest most. One day to be a miser you aspire, The next to wallow drunken in the mire; The third, lo! you're a meritorious liar! Pray, in the catalogue of all your graces Have theft and cowardice no honored places? Yield thee, great Satanâhere's a rival name With all thy vices and but half thy shame! Quick to the letter of the precept, quick To the example of the elder Nick; With as great talent as was e'er applied To fool a teacher and to fog a guide; With slack allegiance and boundless greed, To paunch the profit of a traitor deed, He aims to make thy glory all his own, And crowd his master from the infernal throne! INDICTMENT ON EVIDENCE Bruce Douglas, nephew to a Scottish Earl, Sat in the City Prison, low in heart And spirits. Round him lay the forms of menâ Men of the people, of ignoble birthâ Prone or supine in sleep; but sleep and he Were out: the Douglas was too drunk for sleep. And so he sat and moaned; and still his moan Had all the cadences and stops of songâ Recurrent swells and measured silences Which sought the ear as ocean's billows roll, At even spaces and with matching speed, One after one ashore. Wherefore uprose An old gray constable who in the morn And blossom of his life had courted fame As horse-reporter for a public print, And so was skilled in letters, and he spake, There to the sergeant, saying: âSurely, now, The man's a poet. In his moan I hear The pulsing and the passion of the seaâ Hear the far beating of the waterfall, Throbbing of noon-day insects in the grassâ All rhythmic movements of the universe Which poets echo in their thought and speech, Even in their inarticulate complaints Of pain. My life I'll hazard that the man's A bard disguised to look a gentleman.â So, bringing his effects, which had till then Lain unconsideredâfrom his pockets plucked And tossed asideâall curiously they Explored the papers. Odes and odes there were, And every ode in praise of some fair scene In a fair land; and the fair land was this Our California. From the snowy peaks That glitter in the skies of Siskiyou, Down to the golden margin where the land Slips underneath the San Diegan bay; And from the dim Sierra, far across To where old Ocean bears upon his breast The Mongol horde returning to its own, Its native land and its dear household gods, Bruce Douglas, nephew of a Scottish Earl, Had sung the beauty of the Golden State! So then the Clerk, splitting the Book of Doom, Charged him therein with murder, arson, rape, Theft, libel, mayhem and intent to leave The State and so defraud his creditorsâ With vagrancy, extortion and assault Felonious, obtaining cash by false Pretensesâwith infanticideâeven him, Bruce Douglas, nephew of a Scottish Earl. TO AN ASPIRANT What! you a Senator?âyou, Mike de Young? Still reeking of the gutter whence you sprung? Sir, if all Senators were such as youâ Their hands so slender and so crimson too (Shaped to the pocket for commercial work, For literary, fitted to the dirk)â So black their hearts, so lily-white their liversâ The toga's touch would give a man the shivers! AT THE WHITE HOUSE Among the notables one day that came To see the President was one whose name Was known from Porto Rico to Luzon, Although it wasn't Smith nor even John. Renowned in field and council too, for he Had tilled the soil and been a school trustee. Occasionally, just to pass the time, He worked at patriotism and scowled at crime; Went up and down the land denouncing those Who loved him little as the country's foes; Predicted famine when they scorned his story, And for the ensuing harvest claimed the glory. His name indeed was famous, but because My memory's weak I know not what it was. The President he came that day to see Was as illustrious in his way as he. His name a household wordâthat is to say Men damned him roundly to begin the day, Deplored him in the fireside's rosy light And grunted disesteem throughout the night. Not all menâsome, the sons of pious mothers, Prayed for him daily as upon him others. Sleek, snug, self-righteous, cunning as a rat, A fish in fervor and in faith a cat, Obscure by nature, he had ne'er been great If Fortune had not kicked him into state. His name? Go ask Posterity, not meâ From words opprobrious my page is free. So they were marriedâno I mean they met; For aught I know they are in session yet, There in the White House, for each swore the place Belonged to him by God's abounding grace. But, O, may He take measures to prevent If both at once they would be President. TIDINGS OF GOOD Old Nick from his place of last resort Came up and looked the world over. He saw how the grass of the good was short And the wicked lived in clover. And he gravely said: âThis is all, all wrong, And never by me intended. If to me the power ever belong I shall have this thing amended.â He looked so solemn and good and wise As he made this observation That the men who heard him believed their eyes Instead of his reputation. So they bruited the matter about, and each Reported the words as nearly As memory servedâwith additional speech To bring out the meaning clearly. The consequence was that none understood, And the wildest rumors started Of something intended to help the good And injure the evil-hearted. Then Robert Morrow was seen to smile With a bright and lively joyance. âA man,â said he, âthat is free from guile Will now be free from annoyance. âThe Featherstones doubtless will now increase And multiply like the rabbits, While jailers, deputy sheriffs, police, And writers will form good habits. âThe widows more easily robbed will be, And no juror will ever heed 'em, But open his purse to my eloquent plea For security, gain, or freedom.â When Benson heard of the luck of the good (He was eating his dinner) he muttered: âIt cannot help me, for 'tis understood My bread is already buttered. âMy plats of surveys are all false, they say, But that cannot greatly matter To me, for I'll tell the jurors that they May lick, if they please, my platter.â AN ACTOR Some one ('tis hardly new) has oddly said The color of a trumpet's blare is red; And Joseph Emmett thinks the crimson shame On woman's cheek a trumpet-note of fame. The more the red storm rises round her noseâ The more her eyes averted seek her toes, He fancies all the louder he can hear The tube resounding in his spacious ear, And, all his varied talents to exert, Deepens his dullness to display his dirt. And when the gallery's applauding crowd, And gentlemen below, with hisses loud, In hot contention (these his art to crown, And those his naked nastiness to drown) Make such a din that cheeks erewhile aflame Grow white and in their fear forget their shame, With impudence imperial, sublime, Unmoved, the patient actor bides his time, Till storm and counter-storm are both allayed, Like donkeys, each by t'other one outbrayed. When all the place is silent as a mouse One slow, suggestive gesture clears the house! FAMINE'S REALM To him in whom the love of Nature has Imperfectly supplanted the desire And dread necessity of food, your shore, Fair Oakland, is a terror. Over all Your sunny level, from Tamaletown To where the Pestuary's fragrant slime, With dead dogs studded, bears its azure fleet, Broods the still menace of starvation. Bones Of men and women bleach along the ways And pampered vultures sleep upon the trees. It is a land of death, for Famine there Holds sovereignty; though some there be her sway Who challenge, and intrenched in larders live, Drawing their sustentation from abroad. But woe to him, the stranger! He shall die As die the early righteous in the bud And promise of their prime. He, venturesome To penetrate the wilds rectangular Of grass-grown ways luxuriant of blooms, Frequented of the bee and of the blithe, Bold squirrel, strays with heedless feet afar From human habitation and is lost In mid-Broadway. There hunger seizes him, And (careless man! deeming God's providence Extends so far) he has not wherewithal To bate its urgency. Then, lo! appears A restaurantâa mealeryâa place Where poison battles famine, and the two, Like fish-hawks warring in the upper sky For that which one has taken from the deep, Manage between them to dispatch the prey. He enters and leaves hope behind. There ends His history. Anon his bones, clean-picked By buzzards (with the bones himself had picked, Incautious) line the highway. O, my friends, Of all felonious and deadlywise Devices of the Enemy of Souls, Planted along the ways of life to snare Man's mortal and immortal part alike, The Oakland restaurant is chief. It lives That man may die. It flourishes that life May wither. Its foundation stones repose On human hearts and hopes. I've seen in it Crabs stewed in milk and salad offered up With dressing so unholily compound That it included flour and sugar! Yea, I've eaten dog there!âdog, as I'm a man, Dog seethed in sewage of the town! No moreâ Thy hand, Dyspepsia, assumes the pen And scrawls a tortured âFinisâ on the page. THE MACKAIAD Mackay's hot wrath to Bonynge, direful spring Of blows unnumbered, heavenly goddess, singâ That wrath which hurled to Hellman's office floor Two heroes, mutually smeared with gore, Whose hair in handfuls marked the dire debate, And riven coat-tails testified their hate. Sing, muse, what first their indignation fired, What words augmented it, by whom inspired. First, the great Bonynge comes upon the scene And asks the favor of the British Queen. Suppliant he stands and urges all his claim: His wealth, his portly person and his name, His habitation in the setting sun, As child of nature; and his suit he won. No more the Sovereign, wearied with his plea, From slumber's chain her faculties can free. Low and more low the royal eyelids creep, She gives the assenting nod and falls asleep. Straightway the Bonynges all invade the Court And telegraph the news to every port. Beneath the seas, red-hot, the tidings fly, The cables crinkle and the fishes fry! The world, awaking like a startled bat, Exclaims: âA Bonynge? What the devil's that?â Mackay, meanwhile, to envy all attent, Untaught to spare, unable to relent, Walks in our town on needles and on pins, And in a mean, revengeful spiritâgrins! Sing, muse, what next to break the peace occurredâ What act uncivil, what unfriendly word? The god of Bosh ascending from his pool, Where since creation he has played the fool, Clove the blue slush, as other gods the sky, And, waiting but a moment's space to dry, Touched Bonynge with his finger-tip. âO son,â He said, âalike of nature and a gun, Knowest not Mackay's insufferable sin? Hast thou not heard that he doth stand and grin? Arise! assert thy manhood, and attest The uncommercial spirit in thy breast. Avenge thine honor, for by Jove I swear Thou shalt not else be my peculiar care!â He spake, and ere his worshiper could kneel Had dived into his slush pool, head and heel. Full of the god and to revenges nerved, And conscious of a will that never swerved, Bonynge set sail: our world beyond the wave As gladly took him as the other gave. New York received him, but a shudder ran Through all the western coast, which knew the man; And science said the seismic agitation Was due to mutable equilibration. O goddess, sing what Bonynge next essayed. Did he unscabbard the avenging blade, The long spear brandish and porrect the shield, Havoc the town and devastate the field? His sacred thirst for blood did he allay By halving the unfortunate Mackay? Small were the profit and the joy to him To hew a base-born person, limb from limb. Let vulgar souls to low revenge incline, That of diviner spirits is divine. Bonynge at noonday stood in public places And (with regard to the Mackays) made faces! Before those formidable frowns and scowls The dogs fled, tail-tucked, with affrighted howls, And horses, terrified, with flying feet O'erthrew the apple-stands along the street, Involving the metropolis in vast Financial ruin! Men themselves, aghast, Retreated east and west and north and south Before the menace of that twisted mouth, Till Jove, in answer to their prayers, sent Night To veil the dreadful visage from their sight! Such were the causes of the horrid strifeâ The mother-wrongs that nourished it to life, O, for a quill from an archangel's wing! O, for a voice that's adequate to sing The splendor and the terror of the fray, The scattered hair, the coat-tails all astray, The parted collars and the gouts of gore Reeking and smoking on the banker's floor, The interlocking limbs, embraces dire, Revolving bodies in deranged attire! Vain, vain the trial: 'tis vouchsafed to none To sing two millionaires rolled into one! My hand and pen their offices refuse, And hoarse and hoarser grows the weary muse. Alone remains, to tell of the event, Abandoned, lost and variously rent, The Bonynge nethermost habiliment. A SONG IN PRAISE Hail, blessed Blunder! golden idol, hail!â Clay-footed deity of all who fail. Celestial image, let thy glory shine, Thy feet concealing, but a lamp to mine. Let me, at seasons opportune and fit, By turns adore thee and by turns commit. In thy high service let me ever be (Yet never serve thee as my critics me) Happy and fallible, content to feel I blunder chiefly when to thee I kneel. But best felicity is his thy praise Who utters unaware in works and waysâ Who laborare est orare proves, And feels they suasion wheresoe'er he moves, Serving thy purpose, not thine altar, still, And working, for he thinks it his, thy will. If such a life with blessings be not fraught, I envy Peter Robertson for naught. A POET'S FATHER Welcker, I'm told, can boast a father great And honored in the service of the State. Public Instruction all his mind employsâ He guides its methods and its wage enjoys. Prime Pedagogue, imperious and grand, He waves his ferule o'er a studious land Where humming youths, intent upon the page, Thirsting for knowledge with a noble rage, Drink dry the whole Pierian spring and ask To slake their fervor at his private flask. Arrested by the terror of his frown, The vaulting spit-ball drops untimely down; The fly impaled on the tormenting pin Stills in his awful glance its dizzy din; Beneath that stern regard the chewing-gum Which writhed and squeaked between the teeth is dumb; Obedient to his will the dunce-cap flies To perch upon the brows of the unwise; The supple switch forsakes the parent wood To settle where 'twill do the greatest good, Puissant still, as when of old it strove With Solomon for spitting on the stove. Learned Professor, variously great, Guide, guardian, instructor of the Stateâ Quick to discern and zealous to correct The faults that mar the public intellect From where of Siskiyou the northern bound Is frozen eternal to the sunless ground To where in San Diego's torrid clime The swarthy Greaser swelters in his grimeâ Beneath your stupid nose can you not see The dunce whom once you dandled on your knee? O mighty master of a thousand schools, Stop teaching wisdom, or stop breeding fools. A COWARD When Marriot, distressed by an âattack,â Has the strange insolence to answer back He hides behind a name that is a lie, And out of shadow falters his reply. God knows him, thoughâidentified alike By hardihood to rise and fear to strike, And fitly to rebuke his sins decrees, That, hide from others with what care he please, Night sha'n't be black enough nor earth so wide That from himself himself can ever hide! Hard fate indeed to feel at every breath His burden of identity till death!â No moment's respite from the immortal load, To think himself a serpent or a toad, Or dream, with a divine, ecstatic glow, He's long been dead and canonized a crow! TO MY LIARS Attend, mine enemies of all degrees, From sandlot orators and other fleas To fallen gentlemen and rising louts Who babble slander at your drinking bouts, And, filled with unfamiliar wine, begin Lies drowned, ere born, in more congenial gin. But most attend, ye persons of the press Who live (though why, yourselves alone can guess) In hope deferred, ambitious still to shine By hating me at half a cent a lineâ Like drones among the bees of brighter wing, Sunless to shine and impotent to sting. To estimate in easy verse I'll try The controversial value of a lie. So lend your earsâGod knows you have enough!â I mean to teach, and if I can't I'll cuff. A lie is wicked, so the priests declare; But that to us is neither here nor there. 'Tis worse than wicked, it is vulgar too; N'importeâwith that we've nothing here to do. If 'twere artistic I would lie till death, And shape a falsehood with my latest breath, Parrhasius never more did pity lack, The while his model writhed upon the rack, Than I should for my adversary's pain, (Who, stabbed with fibs again and yet again, Would vainly seek to move my stubborn heart) If slander were, and wit were not, an art. The ill-bred and illiterate can lie As fast as you, and faster far than I. Shall I compete, then, in a strife accurst Where Allen Forman is an easy first, And where the second prize is rightly flung To Charley Shortridge or to Mike de Young? In mental combat but a single end Inspires the formidable to contend. Not by the raw recruit's ambition fired, By whom foul blows, though harmless, are admired; Not by the coward's zeal, who, on his knee Behind the bole of his protecting tree, So curves his musket that the bark it fits, And, firing, blows the weapon into bits; But with the noble aim of one whose heart Values his foeman for he loves his art The veteran debater moves afield, Untaught to libel as untaught to yield. Dear foeman mine, I've but this end in viewâ That to prevent which most you wish to do. What, then, are you most eager to be at? To hate me? Nay, I'll help you, sir, at that. This only passion does your soul inspire: You wish to scorn me. Sir, you shall admire. 'Tis not enough my neighbors that you school In the belief that I'm a rogue or fool; That small advantage you would gladly trade For what one moment would yourself persuade. Write, then, your largest and your longest lie: You sha'n't believe it, howsoe'er you try. No falsehood you can tell, no evil do, Shall turn me from the truth to injure you, So all your war is barren of effect; I find my victory in your respect. What profit have you if the world you set Against me? For the world will soon forget It thought me this or that; but I'll retain A vivid picture of your moral stain, And cherish till my memory expire The sweet, soft consciousness that you're a liar. Is it your triumph, then, to prove that you Will do the thing that I would scorn to do? God grant that I forever be exempt From such advantage as my foe's contempt. âPHILâ CRIMMINS Still as he climbed into the public view His charms of person more apparent grew, Till the pleased world that watched his airy grace Saw nothing of him but his nether faceâ Forgot his follies with his head's retreat, And blessed his virtues as it viewed their seat. ON THE SCALES The proverb hath it, Waterman: âThere never is great loss without Some little gain.â 'Tis Nature's plan Of restitution, I've no doubt; As sometimes a repentant thief Restores, for conscience's relief, Some ten per cent., or thereabout, Of all the loot with which he ran. Dear Governor, when you were ill You lost, they say, some twenty pound; But, muse and ponder as I will, And cast my searching thoughts around, I find in that great loss no gainâ Unless indeed in heart and brain You suffered it; but I'll be bound That they are unaffected still. For still you're foolish and absurd, And still malicious and perverse As ever; and in truth I've heard That since recovering you're worse. The inference, I think, is fair: You lost not what we best could spare: Your character remains to curse The State until you're sepulchred. 'Tis true there's measurably less Of you to packâand you're a loadâ But chiefly that concerns, I guess, The patient beast that you bestrode When, booted, spurred and gloved and all, You led Mark Boruck from the stall, To ride him on that rocky road, Political unrighteousness. In gain to Boruck, though, we scan A loss to every honest soul, It aids the weekly Harridan, His thoroughbred-and-butter foal. To end: the weight whose loss we mourn, From Waterman by illness torn, Was mostly waterâit were droll To learn he'd twenty pounds of man! CODEX HONORIS Jacob Jacobs, of Oakland, he swore: âDat Solomon MartinâI'll haf his gore!â Solomon Martin, of Oakland, he said: âOf Shacob Shacobs der bleed I vill shed!â So they met, with seconds and surgeon at call, And fought with pistol and powder andâall Was done in good faith,âas before I said, They fought with pistol and powder andâshed Tears, O my friends, for each other they marred Fighting with pistol and powder and lard! For the lead had been stolen away, every trace, And Christian hog-product supplied its place. Then the shade of Moses indignant arose: âQuvicker dan lighdnings go vosh yer glose!â Jacob Jacobs, of Oakland, they say, Applied for a pension the following day. Solomon Martin, of Oakland, I hear, Will call himself Colonel for many a year. TO W. H. L. B. Refrain, dull orator, from speaking out, For silence deepens when you raise the shout; But when you hold your tongue we hear, at least, Your noise in mastering that little beast. EMANCIPATION Behold! the days of miracle at last Returnâif ever they were truly past: From sinful creditors' unholy greed The church called Calvary at last is freedâ So called for there the Savior's crucified, Roberts and Carmany on either side. The circling contribution-box no more Provokes the nod and simulated snore; No more the Lottery, no more the Fair, Lures the reluctant dollar from its lair, Nor Ladies' Lunches at a bit a bite Destroy the health yet spare the appetite, While thrifty sisters o'er the cauldron stoop To serve their God with zeal, their friends with soup, And all the brethren mendicate the earth With viewless placards: âWe've been so from birth!â Sure of his wage, the pastor now can lend His whole attention to his latter end, Remarking with a martyr's prescient thrill The Hemp maturing on the cheerless Hill. The holy brethren, lifting pious palms, Pour out their gratitude in prayer and psalms, Chant De Profundis, meaning âout of debt,â And dance like madâor would if they were let. Deeply disguised (a deacon newly dead Supplied the means) Jack Satan holds his head As high as any and as loudly sings His jubilate till each rafter rings. âRejoice, ye ever faithful,â bellows he, âThe debt is lifted and the temple free!â Then says, aside, with gentle cachination: âI have a mortgage on the congregation.â JOHNDONKEY [There isn't a man living who does not have at least a sneaking reverence for a horse-shoe. âEvening Post.] Thus the poor ass whose appetite has ne'er Known than the thistle any sweeter fare Thinks all the world eats thistles. Thus the clown, The wit and Mentor of the country town, Grins through the collar of a horse and thinks Others for pleasure do as he for drinks, Though secretly, because unwilling still In public to attest their lack of skill. Each dunce whose life and mind all follies mar Believes as he is all men living areâ His vices theirs, their understandings his; Naught that he knows not, all he fancies, is, How odd that any mind such stuff should boast! How natural to write it in the Post! HELL The friends who stood about my bed Looked down upon my face and said: âGod's will be doneâthe fellow's dead.â When from my body I was free I straightway felt myself, ah me! Sink downward to the life to be. Full twenty centuries I fell, And then alighted. âHere you dwell For aye,â a Voice criedââthis is Hell!â A landscape lay about my feet, Where trees were green and flowers sweet. The climate was devoid of heat. The sun looked down with gentle beam, Upon the bosom of the stream, Nor saw I any sign of steam. The waters by the sky were tinged, The hills with light and color fringed. Birds warbled on the wing unsinged. âAh, no, this is not Hell,â I cried; âThe preachers ne'er so greatly lied, This is Earth's spirit glorified! âGood souls do not in Hades dwell, And, look, there's John P. Irish!â âWell,â The Voice said, âthat's what makes it Hell.â BY FALSE PRETENSES John S. Hittell, whose sovereign genius wields The quill his tributary body yields; The author of an operaâthat is, All but the music and libretto's his: A work renowned, whose formidable name, Linked with his own, repels the assault of fame From the high vantage of a dusty shelf, Secure from all the world except himself;â Who told the tale of âCultureâ in a screed That some might understand if all would read;â Master of poesy and lord of prose, Dowered, like a setter, with a double nose; That one for Erato, for Clio this; He flushes bothânot his fault if we miss;â Judge of the painter's art, who'll straight proclaim The hue of any color you can name, And knows a painting with a canvas back Distinguished from a duck by the duck's quack;â This thinker and philosopher, whose work Is famous from Commercial street to Turk, Has now a fortune, of his pen the meed. A woman left it him who could not read, And so went down to death's eternal night Sweetly unconscious that the wretch could write. LUCIFER OF THE TORCH O Reverend Ravlin, once with sounding lung You shook the bloody banner of your tongue, Urged all the fiery boycotters afield And swore you'd rather see them die than yield. Alas, how brief the time, how great the change!â Your dogs of war are ailing all of mange; The loose leash dangles from your finger-tips, But the loud âhavocâ dies upon your lips. No spirit animates your feeble clayâ You'd rather yield than even run away. In vain McGlashan labors to inspire Your pallid nostril with his breath of fire: The light of battle's faded from your faceâ You keep the peace, John Chinaman his place. O Ravlin, what cold water, thrown by whom, Upon the kindling Boycott's ruddy bloom, Has slaked your parching blood-thirst and allayed The flash and shimmer of your lingual blade? Your salaryâyour salary's unpaid! In the old days, when Christ with scourges drave The Ravlins headlong from the Temple's nave, Each bore upon his pelt the mark divineâ The Boycott's red authenticating sign. Birth-marked forever in surviving hurts, Glowing and smarting underneath their shirts, Successive Ravlins have revenged their shame By blowing every coal and flinging flame. And you, the latest (may you be the last!) Endorsed with that hereditary, vast And monstrous rubric, would the feud prolong, Save that cupidity forbids the wrong. In strife you preferably pass your daysâ But brawl no moment longer than it pays. By shouting when no more you can incite The dogs to put the timid sheep to flight To load, for you, the brambles with their fleece, You cackle concord to congenial geese, Put pinches of goodwill upon their tails And pluck them with a touch that never fails. âTHE WHIRLIGIG OF TIMEâ Dr. Jewell speaks of Balaam And his vices, to assail 'em. Ancient enmities how cruel!â Balaam cudgeled once a Jewell. A RAILROAD LACKEY Ben Truman, you're a genius and can write, Though one would not suspect it from your looks. You lack that certain spareness which is quite Distinctive of the persons who make books. You show the workmanship of Stanford's cooks About the region of the appetite, Where geniuses are singularly slight. Your friends the Chinamen are understood, Indeed, to speak of you as âbelly good.â Still, you can writeâspell, too, I understandâ Though how two such accomplishments can go, Like sentimental schoolgirls, hand in hand Is more than I can ever hope to know. To have one talent good enough to show Has always been sufficient to command The veneration of the brilliant band Of railroad scholars, who themselves, indeed, Although they cannot write, can mostly read. There's Towne, with Fillmore, Goodman and Steve Gage Ned Curtis of Napoleonic face, Who used to dash his name on glory's page, âA. M.â appended to denote his place Among the learned. Now the last faint trace Of Nap, is all obliterate with age, And Ned's degree less precious than his wage. He says: âI done it,â with his every breath. âThou canst not say I did it,â says Macbeth. Good land! how I run on! I quite forgot Whom this was meant to be about; for when I think upon that odd, unearthly lotâ Not quite Creed Haymonds, yet not wholly menâ I'm dominated by my rebel pen That, like the stubborn bird from which 'twas got, Goes waddling forward if I will or not. To leave your comrades, Ben, I'm now content: I'll meet them later if I don't repent. You've writ a letter, I observeânay, more, You've published itâto say how good you think The coolies, and invite them to come o'er In thicker quantity. Perhaps you drink No corporation's wine, but love its ink; Or when you signed away your soul and swore On railrogue battle-fields to shed your gore You mentally reserved the right to shed The raiment of your character instead. You're naked, anyhow: unragged you stand In frank and stark simplicity of shame. And here upon your flank, in letters grand, The iron has marked you with your owner's nameâ Needless, for none would steal and none reclaim. But âÂ£eland ?tanfordâ is a pretty brand, Wrought by an artist with a cunning hand. But comeâthis naked unreserve is flat: Don your habilimentâyou're fat, you're fat! THE LEGATEEE In fair San Francisco a good man did dwell, And he wrote out a will, for he didn't feel well. Said he: âIt is proper, when making a gift, To stimulate virtue by comforting thrift.â So he left all his property, legal and straight, To âthe cursedest rascal in all of the State.â But the name he refused to insert, for, said he: âLet each man consider himself legatee.â In due course of time that philanthropist died, And all San Francisco, and Oakland besideâ Save only the lawyersâcame each with his claim, The lawyers preferring to manage the same. The cases were tried in Department Thirteen; Judge Murphy presided, sedate and serene, But couldn't quite specify, legal and straight, The cursedest rascal in all of the State. And so he remarked to them, little and bigâ To claimants: âYou skip!â and to lawyers: âYou dig!â They tumbled, tumultuous, out of his court And left him victorious, holding the fort. 'Twas then that he said: âIt is plain to my mind This property's ownerlessâhow can I find The cursedest rascal in all of the State?â So he took it himself, which was legal and straight. âDIED OF A ROSEâ A reporter he was, and he wrote, wrote he: âThe grave was covered as thick as could be With floral tributesââwhich reading, The editor man he said, he did so: âFor âfloral tributesâ he's got for to go, For I hold the same misleading.â Then he called him in and he pointed sweet To a blooming garden across the street, Inquiring: âWhat's them a-growing?â The reporter chap said: âWhy, where's your eyes? Them's floral tributes!â âArise, arise,â The editor said, âand be going.â A LITERARY HANGMAN Beneath his coat of dirt great Neilson loves To hide the avenging rope. He handles all he touches without gloves, Excepting soap. AT THE ELEVENTH HOUR As through the blue expanse he skims On joyous wings, the late Frank Hutchings overtakes Miss Sims, Both bound for Heaven's high gate. In life they loved and (God knows why A lover so should sue) He slew her, on the gallows high Died piousâand they flew. Her pinions were bedraggled, soiled And torn as by a gale, While his were brightâall freshly oiled The feathers of his tail. Her visage, too, was stained and worn And menacing and grim; His sweet and mildâyou would have sworn That she had murdered him. When they'd arrived before the gate He said to her: âMy dear, 'Tis hard once more to separate, But you can't enter here. âFor you, unluckily, were sent So quickly to the grave You had no notice to repent, Nor time your soul to save.â â'Tis true,â said she, âand I should wail In Hell even now, but I Lingered about the county jail To see a Christian die.â A CONTROVERSIALIST I've sometimes wished that Ingersoll were wise To hold his tongue, nor rail against the skies; For when he's made a point some pious dunce Like Bartlett of the Bulletin âreplies.â I brandish no iconoclastic fist, Nor enter the debate an atheist; But when they say there is a God I ask Why Bartlett, then, is suffered to exist. Even infidels that logic might resent, Saying: âThere's no place for his punishment That's worse than earth.â But humbly I submit That he's himself a hell wherever sent. MENDAX High Lord of Liars, Senex, unto thee Let meaner mortals bend the subject knee! Thine is mendacity's imperial crown, Alike by genius, action and renown. No man, since words could set a cheek aflame, E'er lied so greatly with so little shame! O bad old man, must thy remaining years Be passed in leading idiots by their earsâ Thine own (which Justice, if she ruled the roast Would fasten to the penitential post) Still wagging sympatheticallyâhung On the same rocking-bar that bears thy tongue? Thou dog of darkness, dost thou hope to stay Time's dread advance till thou hast had thy day? Dost think the Strangler will release his hold Because, forsooth, some fibs remain untold? No, noâbeneath thy multiplying load Of years thou canst not tarry on the road To dabble in the blood thy leaden feet Have pressed from bosoms that have ceased to beat. Tell to thyself whatever lies thou wilt, Catch as thou canst at pennies got by guiltâ Straight down to death this blessed year thou'lt sink, Thy life washed out as with a wave of ink. But if this prophecy be not fulfilled, And thou who killest patience be not killed; If age assail in vain and vice attack Only by folly to be beaten back; Yet Nature can this consolation give: The rogues who die not are condemned to live! THE RETROSPECTIVE BIRD His caw is a cackle, his eye is dim, And he mopes all day on the lowest limb; Not a word says he, but he snaps his bill And twitches his palsied head, as a quill, The ultimate plume of his pride and hope, Quits his now featherless nose-o'-the-Pope, Leaving that eminence brown and bare, Exposed to the Prince of the Power of the Air. And he sits and he thinks: âI'm an old, old man, Mateless and chickless, the last of my clan, But I'd give the half of the days gone by To perch once more on the branches high, And hear my great-grand-daddy's comical croaks In authorized versions of Bulletin jokes.â THE OAKLAND DOG I lay one happy night in bed And dreamed that all the dogs were dead. They'd all been taken out and shotâ Their bodies strewed each vacant lot. O'er all the earth, from Berkeley down To San Leandro's ancient town, And out in space as far as Nilesâ I saw their mortal parts in piles. One stack upreared its ridge so high Against the azure of the sky That some good soul, with pious views, Put up a steeple and sold pews. No wagging tail the scene relieved: I never in my life conceived (I swear it on the Decalogue!) Such penury of living dog. The barking and the howling stilled, The snarling with the snarler killed, All nature seemed to hold its breath: The silence was as deep as death. True, candidates were all a roar On every platform, as before; And villains, as before, felt free To finger the calliope. True, the Salvationist by night, And milkman in the early light, The lonely flutist and the mill Performed their functions with a will. True, church bells on a Sunday rang The sick man's curtain downâthe bang Of trains, contesting for the track, Out of the shadow called him back. True, cocks at all unheavenly hours Crew with excruciating powers; Cats on the woodshed rang and roared; Fat citizens and fog-horns snored. But this was all too fine for ears Accustomed, through the awful years, To the nocturnal monologues And day debates of Oakland dogs. And so the world was silent. Now What else befellâto whom and how? Imprimis, then, there were no fleas, And days of worth brought nights of ease. Men walked about without the dread Of being torn to many a shred, Each fragment holding half a cruse Of hydrophobia's quickening juice. They had not to propitiate Some curst kioodle at each gate, But entered one another's grounds Unscared, and were not fed to hounds. Women could drive and not a pup Would lift the horse's tendons up And let them goâto interject A certain musical effect. Even children's ponies went about, All grave and sober-paced, without A bulldog hanging to each noseâ Proud of his fragrance, I suppose. Dog being dead, Man's lawless flame Burned out: he granted Woman's claim, Children's and those of country, artâ They all took lodgings in his heart. When memories of his former shame Crimsoned his cheeks with sudden flame He said; âI know my fault too wellâ They fawned upon me and I fell.â Ah! 'twas a lovely world!âno more I met that indisposing bore, The unseraphic cynogogue, The man who's proud to love a dog. Thus in my dream the golden reign Of Reason filled the world again, And all mankind confessed her sway, From Walnut Creek to San Jose. THE UNFALLEN BRAVE Not all in sorrow and in tears, To pay of gratitude's arrears The yearly sumâ Not prompted wholly by the pride Of those for whom their friends have died, To-day we come. Another aim we have in view Than for the buried boys in blue To drop a tear: Memorial Day revives the chin Of Barnes, and Salomon chimes inâ That's why we're here. And when in after ages they Shall pass, like mortal men, away, Their war-song sungâ When Fame shall tell the tale anew Of how intrepidly they drew The deadly tongueâ Then cull white lilies for the graves Of Loyalty's loquacious braves, And roses red. Those represent their livers, these The blood that in unmeasured seas They did not shed. A CELEBRATED CASE Way down in the Boom Belt lived Mrs. Roselle; A person named Petrie, he lived there as well; But Mr. Roselle he resided awayâ Sing tooral iooral iooral iay. Once Mrs. Roselle in her room was alone: The flesh of her flesh and the bone of her bone Neglected the wife of his bosom to wooâ Sing tooral iooral iooral ioo. Then Petrie, her lover, appeared at the door, Remarking: âMy dear, I don't love you no more.â âThat's awfully rough,â said the lady, âon meâ Sing tooral iooral iooral iee.â âCome in, Mr. Petrie,â she added, âpray do: Although you don't love me no more, I love you. Sit down while I spray you with vitriol nowâ Sing tooral iooral iooral iow.â Said Petrie: âThat liquid I know won't agree With my beauty, and then you'll no longer love me; So spray and beââO, what a word he did say!â Sing tooral iooral iooral iay. She deluged his head and continued to pour Till his bonny blue eyes, like his love, were no more. It was seldom he got such a hearty shampooâ Sing tooral iooral iooral ioo. Then Petrie he rose and said: âMrs. Roselle, I have an engagement and bid you farewell.â âYou see,â she began to explainâbut not he!â Sing tooral iooral iooral iee. The Sheriff he came and he offered his arm, Saying, âSorry I am for disturbin' you, marm, But business is business.â Said she, âSo they sayâ Sing tooral iooral iooral iay.â The Judge on the bench he looked awfully stern; The District Attorney began to attorn; The witnesses lied and the lawyersâO my!â Sing tooral iooral iooral iyi. The chap that defended her said: âIt's our claim That he loved us no longer and told us the same. What else than we did could we decently do?â Sing tooral iooral iooral ioo.â The District Attorney, sarcastic, replied: âWe loved you no longerâthat can't be denied. Not having no eyes, we may dote on you nowâ Sing tooral iooral iooral iow.â The prisoner wept to entoken her fears; The sockets of Petrie were flooded with tears. O heaven-born Sympathy, bully for you!â Sing tooral iooral iooral ioo. Four jurors considered the prisoner mad, And four thought her victim uncommonly bad, And four that the acid was âall in his eyeââ Sing rum tiddy iddity iddity hi. COUPLETS [For Inscription on a Sword Presented to Colonel Cutting of the National Guard.] I am for Cutting. I'm a blade Designed for use at dress parade. My gleaming length when I display Peace rules the land with gentle sway; But when the war-dogs bare their teeth Go seek me in the modest sheath. I am for Cutting. Not for me The task of setting nations free; Let soulless blades take human life, My softer metal shuns the strife. The annual review is mine, When gorgeous shopmen sweat and shine, And Biddy, tip-toe on the pave, Adores the cobble-trotting brave. I am for Cutting. 'Tis not mine To hew amain the hostile line; Not mine all pitiless to spread The plain with tumuli of dead. My grander duty lies afar From haunts of the insane hussar Where charging horse and struggling foot Are grimed alike with cannon-soot. When Loveliness and Valor meet Beneath the trees to dance, and eat, And sing, and much besides, behold My golden glories all unfold! There formidably are displayed The harmless horrors of my blade. In time of feast and dance and ballad. I am for cutting chicken salad. A RETORT As vicious women think all men are knaves, And shrew-bound gentlemen discourse of slaves; As reeling drunkards judge the world unsteady, And idlers swear employers ne'er get readyâ Thieves that the constable stole all they had, The mad that all except themselves are mad; So, in another's clear escutcheon shown, Barnes rails at stains reflected from his own; Prates of âdocility,â nor feels the dark Ring round his neckâthe Ralston collar mark. Back, man, to studies interrupted once, Ere yet the rogue had sunk into the dunceâ Back, back to Yale! and, grown with years discreet, The course a virgin's lust cut short, complete. Go drink again at the Pierian pool, And learn at least better to play the fool. No longer scorn the draught, although the font Unlike Pactolus, waters not Belmont. A VISION OF RESURRECTION I had a dream. The habitable earthâ Its continents and islandsâall was bare Of cities and of forests. Naught remained Of its old aspect, and I only knew (As men know things in dreams, unknowing how) That this was earth and that all men were dead. On every side I saw the barren land, Even to the distant sky's inclosing blue, Thick-pitted all with graves; and all the graves Save one were openânot as newly dug, But rather as by some internal force Riven for egress. Tombs of stone were split And wide agape, and in their iron decay The massive mausoleums stood in halves. With mildewed linen all the ground was white. Discarded shrouds upon memorial stones Hung without motion in the soulless air. While greatly marveling how this should be I heard, or fancied that I heard, a voice, Low like an angel's, delicately strong, And sweet as music. âSpirit,â it said, âbehold The burial place of universal Man! A million years have rolled away since here His sheeted multitudes (save only some Whose dark misdeeds required a separate And individual arraigning) rose To judgment at the trumpet's summoning And passed into the sky for their award, Leaving behind these perishable things Which yet, preserved by miracle, endure Till all are up. Then they and all of earth, Rock-hearted mountain and storm-breasted sea, River and wilderness and sites of dead And vanished capitals of men, shall spring To flame, and naught shall be forevermore! When all are risen that wonder will occur. 'Twas but ten centuries ago the last But one came forthâa soul so black with sin, Against whose name so many crimes were set That only now his trial is at end. But one remains.â Straight, as the voice was stilledâ That single rounded mound cracked lengthliwise And one came forth in grave-clothes. For a space He stood and gazed about him with a smile Superior; then laying off his shroud Disclosing two attenuated legs Which, like parentheses, bent outwardly As by the weight of saintliness above, Sprang upward and full soon was lost to view. Noting his headstone overthrown, I read: âSacred to the memory of George K. Fitch, Deacon and Editorâa holy man Who fell asleep in Jesus, full of years And blessedness. The dead in Christ rise first.â MASTER OF THREE ARTS Your various talents, Goldenson, command Respect: you are a poet and can draw. It is a pity that your gifted hand Should ever have been raised against the law. If you had drawn no pistol, but a picture, You would have saved your throttle from a stricture. About your poetry I'm not so sure: 'Tis certain we have much that's quite as bad, Whose hardy writers have not to endure The hangman's fondling. It is said they're mad: Though lately Mr. Brooks (I mean the poet) Looked well, and if demented didn't show it. Well, Goldenson, I am a poet, tooâ Taught by the muses how to smite the harp And lift the tuneful voice, although, like you And Brooks, I sometimes flat and sometimes sharp. But let me say, with no desire to taunt you, I never murder even the girls I want to. I hold it one of the poetic laws To sing of life, not take it. I have shown A high regard for human life because I have such trouble to support my own. And youâwell, you'll find trouble soon in blowing Your private coal to keep it red and glowing. I fancy now I see you at the Gate Approach Saint Peter, crawling on your belly. You cry: âGood sir, take pity on my stateâ Forgive the murderer of Mamie Kelly!â And Peter says: âO, that's all rightâbut, mister, You scribbled rhymes. In Hell I'll make you blister!â THERSITES So, in the Sunday papers you, Del Mar, Damn all great Englishmen in English speech? I am no Englishman, but in my reach A rogue shall never rail where heroes are. You are the man, if I mistake you not, Who lately with a supplicating twitch Plucked at the pockets of the London rich, And paid your share-engraver all you got. Because that you have greatly lied, because You libel nations, and because no hand Of officer is raised to bid you stand, And falsehood is unpunished of the laws, I stand here in a public place to mark With level finger where you part the crowdâ I stand to name you and to cry aloud: âBehold mendacity's great hierarch!â A SOCIETY LEADER âThe Social World!â O what a world it isâ Where full-grown men cut capers in the German, Cotillion, waltz, or what you will, and whiz And spin and hop and sprawl about like mermen! I wonder if our future Grant or Sherman, As these youths pass their time, is passing hisâ If eagles ever come from painted eggs, Or deeds of arms succeed to deeds of legs. I know they tell us about Waterloo: How, âforemost fighting,â fell the evening's dancers. I don't believe it: I regard it true That soldiers who are skillful in the Lancers Less often die of cannon than of cancers. Moreover, I am half-persuaded, too, That David when he danced before the Ark Had the reporter's word to keep it dark. Ed Greenway, you fatigue. Your hateful name Like maiden's curls, is in the papers daily. You think it, doubtless, honorable fame, And contemplate the cheap distinction gaily, As does the monkey the blue-painted tail he Believes becoming to him. 'Tis the same With men as other monkeys: all their souls Crave eminence on any kind of poles. But cynics (barking tribe!) are all agreed That monkeys upon poles performing capers Are not exalted, they are only âtreed.â A glory that is kindled by the papers Is transient as the phosphorescent vapors That shine in graveyards and are seen, indeed, But while the bodies that supply the gas Are turning into weeds to feed an ass. One can but wonder sometimes how it feels To be an assâa beast we beat condignly Because, like yours, his life is in his heels And he is prone to use them unbenignly. The ladies (bless them!) say you dance divinely. I like St. Vitus better, though, who deals His feet about him with a grace more just, And hops, not for he will, but for he must. Doubtless it gratifies you to observe Elbowy girls and adipose mamas All looking adoration as you swerve This way and that; but prosperous papas Laugh in their sleeves at you, and their ha-has, If heard, would somewhat agitate your nerve. And dames and maids who keep you on their shelves Don't seem to want a closer tie themselves. Gods! what a life you live!âby day a slave To your exacting back and urgent belly; Intent to earn and vigilant to save; By night, attired so sightly and so smelly, With countenance as luminous as jelly, Bobbing and bowing! King of hearts and knave Of diamonds, I'd bet a silver brick If brains were trumps you'd never take a trick. EXPOSITOR VERITATIS I slept, and, waking in the years to be, Heard voices, and approaching whence they came, Listened indifferently where a key Had lately been removed. An ancient dame Said to her daughter: âGo to yonder caddy And get some emery to scour your daddy.â And then I knewâsome intuition saidâ That tombs were not and men had cleared their shelves Of urns; and the electro-plated dead Stood pedestaled as statues of themselves. With famous dead men all the public places Were thronged, and some in piles awaited bases. One mighty structure's high faÃ§ade alone Contained a single monumental niche, Where, central in that steep expanse of stone, Gleamed the familiar form of Thomas Fitch. A man cried: âLo! Truth's temple and its founder!â Then gravely added: âI'm her chief expounder.â THE TROUBADOUR Professor Gayley, you're a great man, sure! They say that you can almost fly!âcan spell And parse, but cannot figure well (For mathematics is not literature) And holdâwith rancorâthat twice two are fewer Than they're cracked up to be. Let sinners tell Wherein you disappoint, but I will swell The chorus of your greatness. I'll procure For that exploit a megaphone of brass, And roar your excellences to the sky, And fill with witness all the world! Alas, You can't write poetry! No more can I, But that, you'll notice, is another matter. Besides, I'm less ubiloquent, and fatter. You hold the Chair, so your credentials say, Of English Letters. That is well and fine. Through teaching diligently, line by line, You may yourself have the good luck some day To learn enough of it to bid you stay Your red right hand from making it. The nine Dear Muses then with laurels will entwine Your brows and leg it lightly to display Their joy. O bold, bad poet, hear These words of wisdom (from a grizzled head) Inserted civilly into your ear: In teaching verse you'll better earn your bread, And on our feelings less unkindly trample, If you will work by precept, not example. Not all the shouting capitals you use Can strengthen feebleness, nor all the skill You lack conceal the foolish hates that fill The fountain whence the driblet of your views Flows in a dirty channel to suffuse With slime the British Empire! Dip your quill In something sweeter and you'll write less illâ At least your rant we better can excuse. No doubt you wish you had been born a Boer (Spelling excepted, so indeed you were; A Bore as well) but that's a very poor Ambition. By the Lord! I should prefer To be a Briton though they shot me daily And threw my body to your hoofs, Jack Gayley. A FINGER ON THE LIPS O Mike, have ye heard the good news? They're gwan to have Home Rule at last; An' a Parlyment fine they will chuse, An' wurruk's a thing o' the past. They'll vote every man an estate, Wid all he can drink and ate. Indade it's the blessedest day We've seen since we landed here In America. Whisht! thoughâI sayâ Bedad, it's no place to cheer! For Home Rule we mustn't hurrooâ They'll be wantin' it here if we do. THREE HIGHWAYMEN A street contractor, t'other morn, Walked out before the day was born. The silver moon beyond his reach Had prudently retired, and each Fair golden star his clutch that feared Trembled, grew pale, and disappeared. The sun rose notâafraid to risk His tempting, double-eagle disk. Our heroâwhy spin out the verse?â Two robbers robbed him of his purse, Left him uncomfortably spread On his own pavement, semi-dead, And ran away exultant. He Sang âMurder!â âFire!â in every key, Until politeness bade him cease For fear of waking the police. Then straight unto the Chief, all faint, He made his way and his complaint: âI met two robber-men,â said he; âWe battled andâwell, look at me!â Sad citizen, O Chief, you see.â âHow much?â asked that sententious man. âWell, sir, as nearly as I can Compute it, though I gave them fits, They got awayâwith my six bits.â âWhy, damn your avaricious soul!â The Chief said: âdo you claim the whole? You did quite well to get, begad, Within six bits of all they had!â TO âCOLONELâ DAN BURNS They say, my lord, that you're a Warwick. Well, The title's an absurd one, I believe: You make no kings, you have no kings to sell, Though really 'twere easy to conceive You stuffing half-a-dozen up your sleeve. No, you're no Warwick, skilful from the shell To hatch out sovereigns. On a mare's nest, maybe, You'd incubate a trivial mule baby. I fancy, too, that it is naught but stuff, This âpowerâ that you're said to be âbehind The throne.â I'm sure 'twere accurate enough To represent you simply as inclined To push poor Markham (ailing in his mind And body, which were never very tough) Round in an invalid's wheeled chair. Such menial Employment to low natures is congenial. No, Dan, you're an impostor every way: A human bubble, for âthe earth,â you know, âHath bubbles, as the water hath.â Some day Some careless hand will prick your film, and O, How utterly you'll vanish! Daniel, throw (As fallen Woolsey might to Cromwell say) Your curst ambition to the pigsâthough truly 'Twould make them greater pigs, and more unruly. GEORGE A. KNIGHT Attorney Knight, it happens so sometimes That lawyers, justifying cut-throats' crimes For hireâcalumniating, too, for gold, The dead, dumb victims cruelly unsouledâ Speak, through the press, to a tribunal far More honorable than their Honors are,â A court that sits not with assenting smile While living rogues dead gentleman revile,â A court where scoundrel ethics of your trade Confuse no judgment and no cheating aid,â The Court of Honest Souls, where you in vain May plead your rights to falsity for gain, Sternly reminded if a man engage To serve assassins for the liar's wage, His mouth with villifying falsehoods crammed, He's twice detestable and doubly damned! Attorney Knight, defending Powell, you, To earn your fee, so energetic grew (So like a hound, the pride of all the pack, Clapping your nose upon the dead man's track To run his faults to earthâat least proclaim At vacant holes the overtaken game) That men who marked you flourishing the tongue, And saw your arms so vigorously swung, All marveled how so light a breeze could stir So great a windmill to so great a whir! Little they knew, or surely they had grinned, The mill was laboring to raise the wind. Ralph Smith a âshoulder-striker!â God, O hear This hardy man's description of thy dear Dead child, the gentlest soul, save only One, E'er born in any land beneath the sun. All silent benefactions still he wrought: High deed and gracious speech and noble thought, Kept all thy law and, seeking still the right, Upon his blameless breast received the light. âAvenge, O Lord, Thy slaughtered saints,â one cried Whose wrath was deep as his compassion wideâ Milton, Thy servant. Nay, Thy will be done: To smite or spareâto me it all is one. Can vengeance bring my sorrow to an end, Or justice give me back my buried friend? But if some Milton vainly now implore, And Powell prosper as he did before, Yet 'twere too much that, making no ado, Thy saints be slaughtered and be slandered too. So, Lord, make Knight his weapon keep in sheath, Or do Thou wrest it from between his teeth! UNARMED Saint Peter sat at the jasper gate, When Senator White arrived in state, âAdmit me.â âWith pleasure,â Peter said, Pleased to observe that the man was dead; âThat's what I am here for. Kindly show Your ticket, my lord, and in you go.â White stared in blank surprise. Said he: âI run this placeâjust turn that key.â âYes?â said the Saint; the Senator heard With pain the inflection of that word. But, mastering his emotion, he Remarked: âMy friend, you're too damned free; âI'm Stephen M., by thunder, White!â And, âYes?â the guardian said, with quite The self-same irritating stress Distinguishing his former yes. And still demurely as a mouse He twirled the key to that Upper House. Then Stephen, seeing his bluster vain Admittance to those halls to gain, Said, neighborly: âPray tell me, Pete, Does any one contest my seat?â The Saint replied: âNay, nay, not so; But you voted always wrong below: âWhate'er the question, clear and high You're voice rang: âI,â âI,â ever âI.ââ Now indignation fired the heart Of that insulted immortal part. âDie, wretch!â he cried, with blanching lip, And made a motion to his hip, With purpose murderous and hearty, To draw the Democratic party! He felt his fingers vainly slide Upon his unappareled hide (The dead arise from their âsilent tentsâ But not their late habiliments) Then wailedâthe briefest of his speeches: âI've left it in my other breeches!â A POLITICAL VIOLET Come, Stanford, let us sit at ease And talk as old friends do. You talk of anything you please, And I will talk of you. You recently have said, I hear, That you would like to go To serve as Senator. That's queer! Have you told William Stow? Once when the Legislature said: âGo, Stanford, and be great!â You lifted up your Jovian head And overlooked the State. As one made leisurely awake, You lightly rubbed your eyes And answered: âThank youâplease to make A note of my surprise. âBut who are they who skulk aside, As to get out of reach, And in their clothing strive to hide Three thousand dollars each? âNot members of your body, sure? No, that can hardly be: All statesmen, I suppose, are pure. What! there are rogues? Dear me!â You added, you'll recall, that though You were surprised and pained, You thought, upon the whole, you'd go, And in that mind remained. Now, what so great a change has wrought That you so frankly speak Of âseekingâ honors once unsought Because you âscorned to seek?â Do you not fear the grave reproof In good Creed Haymond's eye? Will Stephen Gage not stand aloof And pass you coldly by? O, fear you not that Vrooman's litch Will rise from earth and point At you a scornful finger which May lack, perchance, a joint? Go, Stanford, where the violets grow, And join their modest train. Await the work of William Stow And be surprised again. THE SUBDUED EDITOR Pope-eater Pixley set in his den A-chewin' upon his quid. He fancied it Leo Thirteen, and then He bit it intenser, he did. The amber which overflew from the cud Like rivers which burst out of boundsâ 'Twas peculiar pleasant to think it blood A-gushin' from Papal wounds. A knockin' was heard uponto the door Where some one a-waitin' was. âCome in,â said the shedder of priestly gore, Arrestin' to once his jaws. The person which entered was curly of hair And smilin' as ever you see; His eyes was blue, and uncommon fair Was his physiognomee. And yet there was some'at remarkable grandâ And the editor says as he looks: âYour Heightâ (it was Highness, you understand That he meant, but he spoke like books)â âYour Height, I am in. I'm the editor man Of this paperâwhich is to say, I'm the owner, too, and it's always ran In the independentest way! âNot a dam galoot can interfere, A-shapin' my course for me: This paper's (and nothing can make it veer) Pixleian in policee!â âIt's little to me,â said the sunny youth, âIf journals is better or worse: Where I am to home they won't keep, in truth, The climate is that perverse. âI've come, howsomever, your mind to light With a more superior fire: You'll have naught hencefor'ard to do but write, While I sets by to inspire. âWe'll make it hot all round, bedad!â And his laughture was loud and free. âThe devil!â cried Pixley, surpassin' mad. âExactly, my friendâthat's me.â So he took a chair and a feather fan, And he sets and sets and sets, Inspirin' that humbled editor man, Which sweats and sweats and sweats! All unavailin' his struggles be, And it's, O, a weepin' sight To see a great editor, bold and free, Reducted to sech a plight! âBLACK BART, Po8â Welcome, good friend; as you have served your term, And found the joy of crime to be a fiction, I hope you'll hold your present faith, stand firm And not again be open to conviction. Your sins, though scarlet once, are now as wool: You've made atonement for all past offenses, And conjugatedâ'twas an awful pull!â The verb âto payâ in all its moods and tenses. You were a dreadful criminalâby Heaven, I think there never was a man so sinful! We've all a pinch or two of Satan's leaven, But you appeared to have an even skinful. Earth shuddered with aversion at your name; Rivers fled backward, gravitation scorning; The sea and sky, from thinking on your shame, Grew lobster-red at eve and in the morning. But still red-handed at your horrid trade You wrought, to reason deaf, and to compassion. But now with gods and men your peace is made I beg you to be good and in the fashion. What's that?âyou âne'er again will rob a stage?â What! did you do so? Faith, I didn't know it. Was that what threw poor Themis in a rage? I thought you were convicted as a poet! I own it was a comfort to my soul, And soothed it better than the deepest curses, To think they'd put one poet in a hole Where, though he wrote, he could not print his verses. I thought that Welcker, Stuart, Brooks and all The ghastly crew who always are begriming With villain couplets every page and wall, Might be arrested and ârun inâ for rhyming. And then Parnassus would be left to me, And Pegasus should bear me up it gaily, Nor down a steep place run into the sea, As now he must be tempted to do daily. Well, grab the lyre-strings, hearties, and begin: Bawl your harsh souls all out upon the gravel. I must endure you, for you'll never sin By robbing coaches, until dead men travel. A âSCION OF NOBILITYâ Come, sisters, weep!âour Baron dear, Alas! has run away. If always we had kept him here He had not gone astray. Painter and grainer it were vain To say he was, before; And if he was, yet ne'er again He'll darken here a door. We mourn each matrimonial planâ Even tradesmen join the cry: He was so promising a man Whenever he did buy. He was a fascinating lad, Deny it all who may; Even âmoneyedâ men confess he had A very taking way. So from our tables he is goneâ Our tears descend in showers; We loved the very fat upon His kidneys, for 'twas ours. To women he was all respect To duns as cold as ice; No lady could his suit reject, No tailor get its price. He raised our hope above the sky; Alas! alack! and O! That one who worked it up so high Should play it down so slow. THE NIGHT OF THE ELECTION âO venerable patriot, I pray Stand not here coatless; at the break of day We'll know the grand resultsâand even now The eastern sky is faintly touched with gray. âIt ill befits thine age's hoary crownâ This rude environment of rogue and clown, Who, as the lying bulletins appear, With drunken cries incarnadine the town. âBut if with noble zeal you stay to note The outcome of your patriotic vote For Blaine, or Cleveland, and your native land, Takeâand God bless you!âtake my overcoat.â âDone, pardâit's mighty white of you. And now I guess the country'll keep the trail somehow. I ain't allowed to vote, the Warden said, But whacked my coat up on old Stanislow.â THE CONVICTS' BALL San Quentin was brilliant. Within the halls Of the noble pile with the frowning walls (God knows they've enough to make them frown, With a Governor trying to break them down!) Was a blaze of light. 'Twas the natal day Of his nibs the popular John S. Gray. âThe ball is free!â cried Black Bart, and they all Said a ball with no chain was a novel ball; âAnd I never have seed,â said Jimmy Hope, âSech a lightsome dance withouten a rope.â Chinamen, Indians, Portuguese, Blacks, Russians, Italians, Kanucks and Kanaks, Chilenos, Peruvians, Mexicansâall Greased with their presence that notable ball. None were excluded excepting, perhaps, The Rev. Morrison's churchly chaps, Whom to prevent a religious debate, The Warden had banished outside of the gate. The fiddler, fiddling his hardest the while, âCalled offâ in the regular foot-hill style: âCircle to the left!â and âForward and back!â And âHellum to port for the stabbard tack!â (This great virtuoso, it would appear, Was Mate of the Gatherer many a year.) âAlly man left!ââto a painful degree His French was unlike to the French of Paree, As heard from our countrymen lately abroad, And his âdoe cee doeâ was the gem of the fraud. But what can you hope from a gentleman barred From circles of culture by dogs in the yard? 'Twas a glorious dance, though, all the same: The Jardin Mabille in the days of its fame Never saw legs perform such springsâ The cold-chisel's magic had given them wings. They footed it featly, those ladies and gents: Dull care (said Long Moll) had a helly go-hence! 'Twas a very aristocratic affair: The crÃªme de la crÃªme of the place was thereâ The swells and belles of our toughest sets, And Hubert Howe Bancroft sent his regrets. TO ONE DETESTED Sir, you're a veteran, revealed In history and fable As warrior since you took the field, Defeating Abel. As Commissary later (or If not, in every cottage The tale is) you contracted for A mess of pottage. In civil life you were, we read (And our respect increases) A man of peaceâa man, indeed, Of thirty pieces. To paying taxes when you turned Your mind, or what you call so, A wide celebrity you earnedâ Sapphira also. In every age, by various names, You've won renown in story, But on your present record flames A greater glory. Cain, Esau, and Iscariot too, And Ananias, likewise, Each had peculiar powers, but who Could lie as Mike lies? THE BOSS'S CHOICE Listen to his wild romances: He advances foolish fancies, Each expounded as his âviewââ Gu. In his brain's opacous clot, ah He has got a maggot! What a Man with âviewsâ to overwhelm us!â Gulielmus. Hear his demagogic clamor Hear him stammer in his grammar! See him laboring to spellâ Gulielmus L. Slave who paid the price demandedâ With two-handed iron branded By the bossâpray cease to dose us, Gulielmus L. Jocosus. A MERCIFUL GOVERNOR Standing within the triple wall of Hell, And flattening his nose against a grate Behind whose brazen bars he'd had to dwell A thousand million ages to that date, Stoneman bewailed his melancholy fate, And his big tear-drops, boiling as they fell, Had worn between his feet, the record mentions, A deep depression in the âgood intentions.â Imperfectly by memory taught howâ For prayer in Hell is a lost artâhe prayed, Uplifting his incinerated brow And flaming hands in supplication's aid. âO grant,â he cried, âmy torment may be stayedâ In mercy, some short breathing spell allow! If one good deed I did before my ghosting, Spare me and give Delmas a double roasting.â Breathing a holy harmony in Hell, Down through the appalling clamors of the place, Charming them all to willing concord, fell A Voice ineffable and full of grace: âBecause of all the law-defying race One single malefactor of the cell Thou didst deny a pardon, thy petition Gains thee ten thousand years of intermission.â Back from their fastenings began to shoot The rusted bolts; with dreadful roar, the gate Laboriously turned; and, black with soot, The extinguished spirit passed that awful strait, And as he legged it into space, elate, Muttered: âYes, I remember that galootâ I'd signed his pardon, ready to allot it, But stuck it in my desk and quite forgot it.â AN INTERPRETATION Now Lonergan appears upon the boards, And Truth and Error sheathe their lingual swords. No more in wordy warfare to engage, The commentators bow before the stage, And bookworms, militant for ages past, Confess their equal foolishness at last, Re-read their Shakespeare in the newer light And swear the meaning's obvious to sight. For centuries the question has been hot: Was Hamlet crazy, or was Hamlet not? Now, Lonergan's illuminating art Reveals the truth of the disputed âpart,â And shows to all the critics of the earth That Hamlet was an idiot from birth! A SOARING TOAD So, Waterman, you would not serve again Although we'd all agree to pay you double. You find it all is vanity and painâ One clump of clover in a field of stubbleâ One grain of pleasure in a peck of trouble. 'Tis sad, at your age, having to complain Of disillusion; but the fault is whose When pigmies stumble, wearing giants' shoes? I humbly told you many moons ago For high preferment you were all unfit. A clumsy bear makes but a sorry show Climbing a pole. Let him, judicious, sit With dignity at bottom of his pit, And none his awkwardness will ever know. Some beasts look better, and feel better, too, Seen from above; and so, I think, would you. Why, you were mad! Did you suppose because Our foolish system suffers foolish men To climb to power, make, enforce the laws, And, it is whispered, break them now and then, We love the fellows and respect them when We've stilled the volume of our loud hurrahs? When folly blooms we trample it the more For having cultivated it before. Behold yon laborer! His garb is mean, His face is grimy, but who thinks to ask The measure of his brains? 'Tis only seen He's fitted for his honorable task, And so delights the mind. But let him bask In droll prosperity, absurdly cleanâ Is that the man whom we admired before? Good Lord, how ignorant, and what a bore! Better for you that thoughtless men had said (Noting your fitness in the humbler sphere): âWhy don't they make him Governor?â instead Of, âWhy the devil did they?â But I fear My words on your inhospitable ear Are wasted like a sermon to the dead. Still, they may profit you if studied well: You can't be taught to think, but may to spell. AN UNDRESS UNIFORM The apparel does not proclaim the manâ Polonious lied like a partisan, And Salomon still would a hero seem If (Heaven dispel the impossible dream!) He stood in a shroud on the hangman's trap, His eye burning holes in the black, black cap. And the crowd below would exclaim amain: âHe's ready to fall for his country again!â THE PERVERTED VILLAGE AFTER GOLDSMITH Sweet Auburn! liveliest village of the plain, Where Health and Slander welcome every train, Whence smiling innocence, its tribute paid, Retires in terror, wounded and dismayedâ Dear lovely bowers of gossip and disease, Whose climate cures us that thy dames may tease, How often have I knelt upon thy green And prayed for death, to mitigate their spleen! How often have I paused on every charm With mingled admiration and alarmâ The brook that runs by many a scandal-mill, The church whose pastor groans upon the grill, The cowthorn bush with seats beneath the shade, Where hearts are struck and reputations flayed; How often wished thine idle wives, some day, Might more at whist, less at the devil, play. Unblest retirement! ere my life's decline (Killed by detraction) may I witness thine. How happy she who, shunning shades like these, Finds in a wolf-den greater peace and ease; Who quits the place whence truth did earlier fly, And rather than come back prefers to die! For her no jealous maids renounce their sleep, Contriving malices to make her weep; No iron-faced dames her character debate And spurn imploring mercy from the gate; But down she lies to a more peaceful end, For beasts don't villify, they only rendâ Sinks piecemeal to their maws, a willing prey, While resignation lubricates the way, And all her prospects brighten at the last: To wolves, not women, an approved repast. MR. SHEETS The Devil stood before the gate Of Heaven. He had a single mate: Behind him, in his shadow, slunk Clay Sheets in a perspiring funk. âSaint Peter, see this season ticket,â Said Satan; âpray undo the wicket.â The sleepy Saint threw slight regard Upon the proffered bit of card, Signed by some sacerdotal cheats: âAdmit the bearer and Clay Sheets.â Peter expanded all his eyes: ââClay Sheets?ââwell, I'll be damned!â he cries. âOur couches are of golden cloud; Nothing of earth is here allowed. I'll let you in,â he added, shedding On Nick a smileââbut not your bedding.â A JACK-AT-ALL-VIEWS So, Estee, you are still alive! I thought That you had died and were a blessed ghost. I know at least your coffin once was bought With Railroad money; and 'twas said by most Historians that Stanford made a boast The seller âthrew you in.â That goes for naughtâ Man takes delight in fancy's fine inventions, And woman too, 'tis said, if they are French ones. Do you remember, Esteeâah, 'twas long And long ago!âhow fierce you grew and hot When anything impeded the straight, strong, Wild sweep of the great billow you had got Atop of, like a swimmer bold? Great Scott! How fine your wavemanship! How loud your song Of âDown with railroads!â When the wave subsided And left you stranded you were much divided. Then for a time you were content to wade The waters of the ârobber barons'â moat. To fetch and carry was your humble trade, And ferry Stanford over in a boat, Well paid if he bestowed the kindly groat And spoke you fair and called you pretty maid. And when his stomach seemed a bit unsteady You got your serviceable basin ready. Strange man! how odd to see you, smug and spruce, There at Chicago, burrowed in a Chair, Not made to measure and a deal too loose, And see you lift your little arm and swear Democracy shall be no more! If it's a fair And civil question, and not too abstruse, Were you elected as a ârobber baron,â Or as a Communist whose teeth has hair on? MY LORD POET âWho drives fat oxen should himself be fat;â Who sings for nobles, he should noble be. There's no non sequitur, I think, in that, And this is logic plain as a, b, c. Now, Hector Stuart, you're a Scottish prince, If right you fathom your descentâthat fall From grace; and since you have no peers, and since You have no kind of nobleness at all, 'Twere better to sing little, lest you wince When made by heartless critics to sing small. And yet, my liege, I bid you not despairâ Ambition conquers but a realm at once: For European bays arrange your hairâ Two continents, in time, shall crown you Dunce! TO THE FOOL-KILLER Ah, welcome, welcome! Sit you down, old friend: Your pipe I'll serve, your bottle I'll attend. 'Tis many a year since you and I have known Society more pleasant than our own In our brief respites from excessive workâ I pointing out the hearts for you to dirk. What have you done since lately at this board We canvassed the deserts of all the horde, And chose what names would please the people best, Engraved on coffin-platesâwhat bounding breast Would give more satisfaction if at rest? But never mindâthe record cannot fail: The loftiest monuments will tell the tale. I trust ere next we meet you'll slay the chap Who calls old Tyler âJudgeâ and Merry âCapââ Calls John P. Irish âColonelâ and John P., Whose surname Jack-son speaks his pedigree, By the same titleâmen of equal rank Though one is belly all, and one all shank, Showing their several service in the fray: One fought for food and one to get away. I hope, I say, you'll kill the âtitleâ man Who saddles one on every back he can, Then rides it from BeÃ«rsheba to Dan! Another fool, I trust, you will perform Your office on while my resentment's warm: He shakes my hand a dozen times a day If, luckless, I so often cross his way, Though I've three senses besides that of touch, To make me conscious of a fool too much. Seek him, friend Killer, and your purpose make Apparent as his guilty hand you take, And set him trembling with a solemn: âShake!â But chief of all the addle-witted crew Conceded by the Hangman's League to you, The fool (his dam's acquainted with a knave) Whose fluent pen, of his no-brain the slave, Strews notes of introduction o'er the land And calls it hospitality. His hand May palsy seize ere he again consign To me his friend, as I to Hades mine! Pity the wretch, his faults howe'er you see, Whom A accredits to his victim, B. Like shuttlecock which battledores attack (One speeds it forward, one would drive it back) The trustful simpleton is twice unblestâ A rare good riddance, an unwelcome guest. The glad consignor rubs his hands to think How duty is commuted into ink; The consignee (his hands he cannot rubâ He has the man upon them) mutters: âCub!â And straightway plans to lose him at the club. You know, good Killer, where this dunce abidesâ The secret jungle where he writes and hidesâ Though no exploring foot has e'er upstirred His human elephant's exhaustless herd. Go, bring his blood! We'll drink itâletting fall A due libation to the gods of Gall. On second thought, the gods may have it all. ONE AND ONE ARE TWO The trumpet sounded and the dead Came forth from earth and ocean, And Pickering arose and sped Aloft with wabbling motion. âWhat makes him fly lop-sided?â cried A soul of the elected. âOne ear was wax,â a rogue replied, âAnd isn't resurrected.â Below him on the pitted plain, By his abandoned hollow, His hair and teeth tried all in vain The rest of him to follow. Saint Peter, seeing him ascend, Came forward to the wicket, And said: âMy mutilated friend, I'll thank you for your ticket.â âThe Call,â said Pickering, his hand To reach the latch extended. Said Peter, affable and bland: âThe free-list is suspendedâ âWhat claim have you that's valid here?â That ancient villifier Reflected; then, with look austere, Replied: âI am a liar.â Said Peter: âThat is simple, neat And candid Anglo-Saxon, Butâwell, come in, and take a seat Up there by Colonel Jackson.â MONTAGUE LEVERSON As some enormous violet that towers Colossal o'er the heads of lowlier flowersâ Its giant petals royally displayed, And casting half the landscape into shade; Delivering its odors, like the blows Of some strong slugger, at the public nose; Pride of two Nationsâfor a single State Would scarce suffice to sprout a plant so great; So Leverson's humility, outgrown The meaner virtues that he deigns to own, To the high skies its great corolla rears In the benign sufflation of his cheers. THE WOFUL TALE OF MR. PETERS I should like, good friends, to mention the disaster that befell Mr. William Perry Peters, of the town of Muscatel. Whose fate is full of meaning if correctly understoodâ Admonition to the haughty, consolation to the good. It happened in the hot snap which we recently incurred, When 'twas warm enough to carbonize the feathers of a bird, And men exclaimed: âBy Hunky!â who were bad enough to swear, And pious persons supervised their adjectives with care. Mr. Peters was a pedagogue of honor and repute, His learning comprehensive, multifarious, minute. It was commonly conceded in the section whence he came That the man who played against him needed knowledge of the game. And some there were who whispered, in the town of Muscatel, That besides the game of Draw he knew Orthography as well; Though the school directors, frigidly contemning that as stuff, Thought that Draw (and maybe Spelling, if he had it) was enough. Withal, he was a haughty manâindubitably great, But too vain of his attainments and his power in debate. His mien was contumelious to men of lesser gift: âIt's only me,â he said, âcan give the human mind a lift. âBefore a proper audience, if ever I've a chance, You'll see me chipping in, the cause of Learning to advance. Just let me have a decent chance to back my mental hand And I'll come to center lightly in a way they'll understand.â Such was William Perry Peters, and I feel a poignant sense Of grief that I'm unable to employ the present tense; But Providence disposes, be our scheming what it may, And disposed of Mr. Peters in a cold, regardless way. It occurred in San Francisco, whither Mr. Peters came In the cause of Education, feeling still the holy flame Of ambition to assist in lifting up the human mind To a higher plane of knowledge than its Architect designed. He attended a convention of the pedagogic host; He was first in the Pavilion, he was last to leave his post. For days and days he narrowly observed the Chairman's eye, His efforts ineffectual to catch it on the fly. The blessed moment came at last: the Chairman tipped his head; âThe gentleman from ahâumâer,â that functionary said. The gentleman from ahâumâer reflected with a grin; âThey'll know me better by-and-by, when I'm a-chipping in.â So William Perry Peters mounted cheerfully his feetâ And straightway was aglow with an incalculable heat! His face was as effulgent as a human face could be, And caloric emanated from his whole periphery; For he felt himself the focus of non-Muscatelish eyes, And the pain of their convergence was a terror and surprise! As with pitiless appulsion all their heat-waves on him broke He was seen to be evolving awful quantities of smoke! âPut him out!â cried all in chorus; but the meaning wasn't clear Of that succoring suggestion to his obfuscated ear; And it notably augmented his incinerating glow To regard himself excessive, or in any way de trop. Gone was all his wild ambition to lift up the human mind!â Gone the words he would have uttered!âgone the thought that lay behind! For âwords that burnâ may be consumed in a superior flame, And âthoughts that breatheâ may breathe their last, and die a death of shame. He'd known himself a shining light, but never had he known Himself so very luminous as now he knew he shone. âA pillar, I, of fire,â he'd said, âto guide my race will be;â And now that very inconvenient thing to him was he. He stood there all irresolute; the seconds went and came; The minutes passed and did but add fresh fuel to his flame. How long he stood he knew notâ'twas a century or moreâ And then that incandescent man levanted for the door! He darted like a comet from the building to the street, Where Fahrenheit attested ninety-five degrees of heat. Vicissitudes of climate make the tenure of the breath Precarious, and William Perry Peters froze to death! TWIN UNWORTHIES Ye parasites that to the rich men stick, As to the fattest sheep the thrifty tickâ Ed'ard to Stanford and to Crocker, Ben (To Ben and Ed'ard many meaner men, And lice to these)âwho do the kind of work That thieves would have the honesty to shirkâ Whose wages are that your employers own The fat that reeks upon your every bone And deign to ask (the flattery how sweet!) About its health and how it stands the heat,â Hail and farewell! I meant to write about you, But, no, my page is cleaner far without you. ART Lo! tooth and nail my countrymen contest Which portrait of Columbus is the best. Considering that the pirate never âsat,â That is as like as this, and this as that. We want a face that shows, by all the rules, A prophecy of ninety million fools. A WAR CRY Charles Shortridge, with his martial mouth in place At his own ear, shouts dreadful! Pale horrors shudder through eternal spaceâ Of which he has a headful. IN DISSUASION Dan Burns, you'd be a Senator, I hear, And Senators are persons of much note. I cannot choose but think it very queer That you solicit for the place a vote. Why, don't you know you'll have to ride the goat, Be skyward from a shaken blanket hurled And put in session on a heated chair Till your immortal part is more than rareâ Your foretaste of another, warmer world? 'Tis said that all ambitious louts who dare Aspire to Senatorial fame receive it In some such fashion, though I don't believe it. Still, you'll suppose that this has all occurred. If in that Upper House you e'er arise, Trembly and hot, to speak your maiden wordâ Walls, desks, floor, ceiling to your failing eyes Seeming to blend, and Senators like flies To spin about in space! Rash man, forbear To cherish your accurst ambition! Sir, Your breeding and your character confer Small right to breathe in that expanded air. For toads to perch with eagles is to err. Pray Heaven to send contentment with your station And bar you from the hauls of legislation. The toga, if you win it, scarce will serve To cover up the stripes (where are the stars?) Which to a fertile fancy seem to curve Round you like shadows of the prison bars. Embezzlement, I'm told, exists in Mars, Where sometimes an official will âconveyâ And in âthe shadow of the jailâ abide Till it seems photographed upon his hide And shapes his gait, as if he dragged alway A ball-and-chain. Upon the Moon's far side Dwells such a man, who knows not (goes the story) Which of the saints he is when out for glory. A PREDICTION When the skies are green with clover, And the cows are flying over; When the roses lose their fragrance; When the ants are shiftless vagrants; When the peacocks pluck their tails, And the lion pares his nails; When old ocean's roaring ridges Roll beneath iridium bridges; When diseases and physicians Quarrel; when the politicians Go to work; when lawyers never Fib no more again forever; When we gather ice to burn, And to eggs potatoes turn; When the pie-distended sleeper On the nightmare keeps his peeper. Quick to round her up and mount her, Field and Terry will âencounter.â When the whales, in battle order, March across our northern border; When the serpent of the sea Is no longer known to be; When the cats intone in Latin, And the lady ape wears satin; When the vulture, Mortgage, perches Nevermore upon the churches; When the sycophant despises Arts by which the bird-louse rises Comfortably to the sky, And the smithy-haunting fly, Sitting on the swelling bellows, Is no prouder than his fellows; When the mocking-bird eschews All of his assenting views, Nor proclaims them out of season; When the poets learn to reason; When lieutenants damn the bullets Penetrating captains' gullets, And a major feels the pain Of his colonel's shattered brain; When the best of human creatures Is the most austere of preachers, And the woman who's demurest Is the truest and the purest; When the Mississippi, yearning For its native hills and turning Deftly backward in its bed, Lays its mouth against its head; When the turtle-doves are cruelâ Field and Terry'll fight a duel. ANOTHER PLAN Editor Owen, of San Jose, Commonly known as âour friend J. J.,â Weary of scribbling for daily bread, Weary of writing what nobody read, Slept one day at his desk and dreamed That an angel before him stood and beamed With compassionate eyes upon him there. Editor Owen is not so fair In feature, expression, form or limb But glances like that are familiar to him; And so, to arrive by the shortest route At his visitor's will he said simply: âToot.â âEditor Owen,â the angel said, âScribble no more for your daily bread. Your intellect staggers and falls and bleeds, Weary of writing what nobody reads. Eschew now the quillâin the coming years Homilize man through his idle ears. Go lecture!â âJust what I intended to do,â Said Owen. The angel looked pained and flew. Editor Owen, of San Jose, Commonly known as âour friend J. J.,â Scribbling no more to supply his needs, Weary of writing what nobody reads, Passes of life each golden year Speaking what nobody comes to hear. A POLITICAL APOSTATE Good friend, it is with deep regret I note The latest, strangest turning of your coat; Though any way you wear that mental clout The seamy side seems always to be out. Who could have thought that you would e'er sustain The Southern shotgun's arbitrary reign?â Your sturdy hand assisting to replace The broken yoke on a delivered race; The ballot's purity no more your care, With equal privilege to dark and fair. To Yesterday a traitor, to To-day You're constant but the better to betray To-morrow. Your convictions all are naught But the wild asses of the world of thought, Which, flying mindless o'er the barren plain, Perceive at last they've nothing so to gain, And, turning penitent upon their track, Economize their strength by flying back. Ex-champion of Freedom, battle-lunged, No more, red-handed, or at least red-tongued, Brandish the javelin which by others thrown Clove Sambo's heart to quiver in your own! Confess no more that when his blood was shed, And you so sympathetically bled, The bow that spanned the mutual cascade Was but the promise of a roaring trade In offices. Your fingering now the trigger Shows that you knew your Negro was a nigger! Ad hominem this argumentum runs: Peace!âlet us fire another kind of guns. I grant you, friend, that it is very true The Blacks are ignorantâand sable, too. What then? One way of two a fool must vote, And either way with gentlemen of note Whose villain feuds the fact attest too well That pedagogues nor vice nor error quell. The fiercest controversies ever rage When Miltons and Salmasii engage. No project wide attention ever drew But it disparted all the learned crew. As through their group the cleaving line's prolonged With fiery combatants each field is thronged; In battle-royal they engage at once For guidance of the hesitating dunce. The Titans on the heights contend full soonâ On this side Webster and on that Calhoun, The monstrous conflagration of their fight Startling the day and splendoring the night! Both are unconquerableâone is right. Will't keep the pigmy, if we make him strong, From siding with a giant in the wrong? When Genius strikes for error, who's afraid To arm poor Folly with a wooden blade? O Rabelais, you knew it all!âyour good And honest judge (by men misunderstood) Knew to be right there was but one device Less fallible than intellectâthe dice. The time must comeâHeaven expedite the day!â When all mankind shall their decrees obey, And nations prosper in their peaceful sway. TINKER DICK Good Parson Dickson preached, I'm told, A sermonâah, 'twas very old And very, very bald! 'Twas all aboutâI know not what It was about, nor what 'twas not. âA Screw Looseâ it was called. Whatever, Parson Dick, you say, The world will get each blessed day Still more and more askew, And fall apart at last. Great snakes! What skillful tinker ever takes His tongue to turn a screw? A PEACEFUL COMMUNITY With lifted hands, Lone Mountain's giant cross Stands in the sky against the Western splendor! (A ship beyond is playing pitch-and-toss; She hugsâships all are feminine in genderâ The shore, then fickly turns away to find Another shore to suit her altered mind.) About the foot of that tall rood are spread The simple mound and pompous mausoleumâ Three several republics of the dead, Whose citizens love peace. You'll never see 'em Assail a street-car passenger with stones, Nor brain a woman with their marrow bones. Not even in Potter's Field the pauper crew E'er go on strike to get a fair division Of monumental fame. (If they but knew, Their barren paddock is a Field Elysian, Compared with many an historic place, Where royal odors leg it into space.) The dead intimidate no Sandlot Judge, Nor was it ever their besetting sin to Scare burly Sheriffs. Faith! I'd not begrudge That cross the necks if it were fashioned into A double gibbet, on one arm to bear A rioter, on t'other one a Mayor. Long live the dead! Since they prefer to live Within the law, it is a monstrous pity That early legislation did not give Them the authority to rule this city. Here's to their health! and may their tribe increaseâ Recruited from the Judges and Police. WITH A BOOK Words shouting, singing, smiling, frowningâ Sense lacking. Ah, nothing, more obscure than Browning, Save blacking. A COMPETITOR Mrs. Frona Eunice Wait, My legs are not so very straight; My spine, I'm sorry to observe, Maintains a most rebellious curve; My neck is skinny, and my bust Would justify a husband's trust. But papa thinks his Mary Ann Is built upon a gorgeous plan. Mrs. Frona Eunice Wait, I take the liberty to state That Venuses would go on strike If ordered to be all alike; For some are made for this, and some For thatâyou take 'em as they come. But papa says: âMy Mary Ann Knocks out the whole damn caravan!â Mrs. Frona Eunice Wait, They think in Greaserville I'm greatâ They say in Greaserville: âYou bet She'll make them hens get up and get! She's just a bird!â So when I clout Myself in cheese-cloth you look out! For papa says: âMy Mary Ann Has win whenever she has ran.â Mrs. Frona Eunice Wait, I'm giving you the business straight: Make any standards that you please Beneath my cloth I'm just the cheese. I care not what the artists sayâ I'm in it and I'm in to stay. For papa says: âIf Mary Ann Will advertise she'll get a man.â Mrs. Frona Eunice Wait, Head Venus-herder of the State, Round up your girls. But Frona, dear I think it very, very queer That you yourself do not compete. Are you too plump or too petite? My papa says: âWhy, Mary Ann, She's from BeÃ«rsheba to Dan!â GENEROSITY By seven brave poems the Mikado shows His royal fitness for the field of prose. Of bold, bad bards to crown him brother-chief Dick Watson Gilder spares one laurel leaf. BATS IN SUNSHINE Well, Mr. Kemble, you are called, I think, A great divine, and I'm a great profane. You as a Congregationalist blink Some certain truths that I esteem a gain, And drop into the coffers of my brain, Pleased with the pretty music of their chink. Perhaps your spiritual wealth is such A golden truth or two can't count for much. You say that you've no patience with such stuff As by RÃ©nan is writ, and when you read (Why do you read?) have hardly strength enough To hold your hand from flinging the vile screed Into the fire. That were a wasteful deed Which you'd repent in sackcloth extra rough; For books cost money, and I'm told you care To lay up treasures Here as well as There. I fear, good, pious soul, that you mistake Your thrift for toleration. Never mind: RÃ©nan in any case would hardly break His great, strong, charitable heart to find The bats and owls of your myopic kind Pained by the light that his ideas make. 'Tis Truth's best purpose to shine in at holes Where cower the Kembles, to confound their souls! A WORD TO THE UNWISE [Charles Main, of the firm of Main &amp; Winchester, has ordered a grand mausoleum for his plot in Mountain View Cemetery.â City Newspaper.]. Charles Main, of Main &amp; Winchester, attend With friendly ear the chit-chat of a friend Who knows you not, yet knows that you and he Travel two roads that have a common end. We journey forward through the time allowed, I humbly bending, you erect and proud. Our heads alike will stable soon the wormâ The one that's lifted, and the one that's bowed. You in your mausoleum shall repose, I where it pleases Him who sleep bestows; What matter whether one so little worth Shall stain the marble or shall feed the rose? Charles Main, I had a friend who died one day. A metal casket held his honored clay. Of cyclopean architecture stood The splendid vault where he was laid away. A dozen years, and lo! the roots of grass Had burst asunder all the joints; the brass, The gilded ornaments, the craven stones Lay tumbled all together in a mass. A dozen years! That taxes your belief. Make it a thousand if the time's too brief. 'Twill be the same to you; when you are dead You cannot even count our days of grief. Suppose a pompous monument you raise Till on its peak the solar splendor blaze While yet about its base the night is black; But will it give your glory length of days? Say, when beneath, your rubbish has been thrown, Some rogue to reputation all unknownâ Men's backs being turnedâshould lift his thieving hand, Efface your name and substitute his own, Whose then would be the monument? To whom Would be the fame? Forgotten in your gloomâ Your very name forgotten!âah, my friend, The name is all that's rescued by the tomb. For memory of worth and work we go To other records than a stone can show. These lacking, naught remains; with these The stone is needless for the world will know. Then build your mausoleum if you must, And creep into it with a perfect trust; But in the twinkling of an eye the plow Shall pass without obstruction through your dust. Another movement of the pendulum, And, low! the desert-haunting wolf shall come, And, seated on the spot, shall howl by night O'er rotting cities, desolate and dumb. ON THE PLATFORM When Dr. Bill Bartlett stepped out of the hum Of Mammon's distracting and wearisome strife To stand and deliver a lecture on âSome Conditions of Intellectual Life,â I cursed the offender who gave him the hall To lecture on any conditions at all! But he rose with a fire divine in his eye, Haranguing with endless abundance of breath, Till I slept; and I dreamed of a gibbet reared high, And Dr. Bill Bartlett was dressing for death. And I thought in my dream: âThese conditions, no doubt, Are bad for the life he was talking about.â So I cried (pray remember this all was a dream): âGet down off the platform!âit isn't the kind!â But he fell through the trap, with a jerk at the beam, And wiggled his toes to unburden his mind. And, O, so bewitching the thoughts he advanced That I clung to his ankles, attentive, entranced! JUDGE NOT To foreigners in San Francisco, greeting. When you see a labor-leader fiercely beating The air with all his fingers to betoken His view of this or that ere yet 'tis spoken,â When you see him, as in dancing, foot it featly To manifest dissent the more completely,â When you hear him in a tempest of emotion Deflate himself of some unpeaceful notion, Don't prophesy a blazing revolution; Don't drag the guillotine from its seclusion; Don't whistle up a storm of blood and thunder, To fill the world with horror, fear and wonder! He's dreadful in defining his position, He's terrible in threatening seditionâ And a Past Grand Master of Submission. DESPERATION My days all are wasted in vainly Contesting the field against Fate; My nights with remorses insanely Are swarming, and spectres of hate. âO for rest! O for peace!â I cry madlyâ âLet me fall, for I faint in the strife. To be dead, to be dead, I'd give gladly All, all that I have, except life.â TO DOG Pervading pest! Old Adam, when he saw Thy prime progenitor, I doubt not, swore And kicked the curst kioodle from the door, Though now thy whelpage we protect by law. In faith, thou must have been a beastly, raw, Uncultivated monster many score Immemorable centuries before Thy rigor was by breeding made to thaw. How racy of the soil thou must have been!â Indigenous and close to nature's heart! How strong thy jaw-lock, habits how unclean, And what a sink of infamy thy heart! It may be, though, thou wert created upright. If Man (the angels' care) could fall, a pup might. TO A GRABBER If, Prentiss Maslin, you would kindly leave A coin or two of what the State has hoarded We'd think it generous of you; for we've But just begun our fortunes to retrieve, Having lost all our treasury afforded To certain robbers, who, departing, left Us you as a memorial of the theft. Memorial? Bless you! you're the very thing Incarnateâand by no means any cleaner For incarnation. Sir, you are the king Of crimes, grown great and proud remembering When you were young and but a misdemeanor. Let lesser souls be ravenous of pelf, He scorns the gains of greed who's greed itself. What! shall a firework covetously yearn While splendoring the skiesâa gorgeous rocket Where golden constellations grandly burnâ To take the earth along? 'Tis sad to learn That even the robe of glory has a pocket. In you, alas! I'd fondly hoped to see One man that loved himself unselfishly. MEMORIAL DAY The bands have played, the singers finished singing, The flags done flapping and the bells done ringing. Hereditary candidates have spoken; Their tongues are silent and their hearts are brokenâ Barnes, Shortridge, Salomon-in-all-his-glory, With wounds (their mouths) no longer wide and goryâ Healed by the touch of time; for even orations Must sometimes come to end if one have patience. And still in spite of all the din infernal Of every âGeneralâ and âJudgeâ and âColonel,â Our grand old heroes sleep in peace eternal! A DAMPENED ARDOR The Chinatown at Bakersfield Was blazing bright and high; The flames to water would not yield, Though torrents drenched the sky And drowned the ground for miles aroundâ The houses were so dry. Then rose an aged preacher man Whom all did much admire, Who said: âTo force on you my plan I truly don't aspire, But streams, it seems, might quench these beams If turned upon the fire.â The firemen said: âThis hoary wight His folly dares to thrust On us! 'Twere well he felt our mightâ Nay, he shall feel our must!â With jet of wet and small regret They laid that old man's dust. ADAIR WELCKER, POET The Swan of Avon diedâthe Swan Of Sacramento'll soon be gone; And when his death-song he shall coo, Stand back, or it will kill you too. TO A WORD-WARRIOR Frank Pixley, you, who kiss the hand That strove to cut the country's throat, Cannot forgive the hands that smote Applauding in a distant land,â Applauding carelessly, as one The weaker willing to befriend Until the quarrel's at an end, Then learn by whom it was begun. When North was pitted against South Non-combatants on either side In calculating fury vied, And fought their foes by word of mouth. That made logomachy you led With formidable feats of tongue. Then on the battle's rear you hungâ With Samson's weapon slew the dead! So hot the ardor of your soul That every fierce civilian came His torch to kindle at your flame, Or have you blow his cooling coal. Men prematurely left their beds And sought the gelid bathâso great The heat and splendor of your hate Of Englishmen and âCopperheads.â King Liar of deceitful men, For imposition doubly armed! The patriots whom your speaking charmed You stung to madness with your pen. There was a certain journal here, Its English owner growing richâ Your hand the treason wrote for which A mob cut short its curst career. If, Pixley, you had not the brain To know the true from false, or you To Truth had courage to be true, And loyal to her perfect reign; If you had not your powers arrayed To serve the wrong by tricksy speech, Nor pushed yourself within the reach Of retribution's accolade, I had not had the will to go Outside the olive-bordered path Of peace to cut the birch of wrath, And strip your body for the blow. Behold how dark the war-clouds rise About the mother of our race! The lightnings gild her tranquil face And glitter in her patient eyes. Her children throng the hither flood And lean intent above the beach. Their beating hearts inhibit speech With stifling tides of English blood. âTheir skies, but not their hearts, they change Who go in ships across the seaââ Through all the centuries to be The strange new land will still be strange. The Island Mother holds in gage The souls of sons she never saw; Superior to law, the law Of sympathetic heritage. Forgotten now the foolish reign Of wrath that sundered trivial ties. A soldier's sabre vainly tries To cleave a spiritual chain. The iron in our blood affines, Though fratricidal hands may spill. Shall Hate be throned on Bunker Hill, Yet Love abide in Seven Pines? A CULINARY CANDIDATE A cook adorned with paper cap, Or waiter with a tray, May be a worthy kind of chap In his way, But when we want one for Recorder, Then, Mr. Walton, take our order. TO ONE ACQUITTED Sir, you have killed a man and you are freeâ That is, your hanging ne'er will come about; For I've observed when jurors disagree 'Tis not as 'tis when other thieves fall out. Some honest men are in the case, no doubt, But none come by their ownânot even the chap Whose honest office is to spring the trap. Some needy tramp, I think, is deputized That lowly function to performâalthough I must confess I am not well advised Concerning that: I ne'er did undergo A hanging; but if I am right you owe The customary perquisite to some Poor shivering and disappointed âbum.â If Californian hangmen are too proud To wear the clothing of the wretch they string, And the good ancient custom's been allowed To lapse; or if so seldom murderers swing In this good land that there is no such thing As custom in the case, the truth we reach is: You've forfeited your life, but not your breeches. CONTENT One day when Satan visited the earth In order that his eyes might feed his mirth, A loyal follower in sorrow said, âFather of Falsehood, to our idols wed We rear memorials in bronze and stone To every kind of mortal greatness known; But not in this thy realm stands anywhere A monument or statue to declare Thy greater glory.â With the modest mien Of violet that loves to bloom unseen, Satan replied: âAll earthly fame I shun, Content with consciousness of work well done. Statues to heroes! Mine the humble glory To tell on every pedestal the story.â AT THE OBSERVATORY Mahatma Holden, Autocrat of Stars, Fixed to the telescope his curious eye And waited for some great phenomenon To seek his field of vision. Years and years, Retiring early, rising with the sun, With patience proof against defeat, he still Had sought some grand discovery; and still, Dogging the footsteps of endeavor, came Grim disappointment and in mockery Derided him. But now, even as he gazed, A great white light crept up the sky, and lo! Into the telescope's illumined ken Swam with a stately grace a noble orb, And paused in mid-field of the mighty tube! Mahatma Holden, Autocrat of Stars, Was found next morn beneath the instrument, Senseless and motionless as one that's dead. âBy some emotion overcome,â said one (Sometime physician to the Ghug of Smat) Who with sharp stimulants and kindly words Strove to revive him. Scarcely had the fresh And wholesome air saluted both his lungs Than, âPaper!â cried heââpaper, pen and ink! Quick, ere the glorious memory fades! Ah, friends, Not all in vain my vigils and my skill To read the secrets of the upper deep: At last I'm famous and my name shall ring Adown the centuries unlinked with theirs, My menials, Burnham, Bar?â he faltered then, Yet with a mighty effort peaced himself, Mastered his spirit, calmly gazed about And, with angelic dignity, explained: âI've found the Moon!â And it was even so. THE OLEOMARGARINE MAN Onceâin the county of Marin, Where milk is sold to purchase ginâ Renowned for butter and renowned For fourteen ounces to the poundâ A bull stood watching every turn Of Mr. Wilson with a churn, As that designing worthy stalked About him, eying as he walked El Toro's sleek and silken hide, His neck, his flank and all beside; Thinking with secret joy: âI'll spread This mammal on a slice of bread!â Soon Mr. Wilson's keen concern To get the creature in his churn Unhorsed his cautionâmade him blind To the fell vigor of bullkind, Till, filled with valor to the teeth, He drew his dasher from its sheath And bravely brandished it; the while He smiled a dark, portentous smile; A deep, sepulchral smile; a wide, And open smile, which, at his side, The churn to copy vainly tried; A smile so like the dawn of doom That all the field was palled in gloom, And all the trees within a mile, As tribute to that awful smile, Made haste, with loyalty discreet, To fling their shadows at his feet. Then rose his battle-cry: âI'll spread This mammal on a slice of bread!â To such a night the day had turned That Taurus dimly was discerned. He wore so meek and grave an air It seemed as if, engaged in prayer This thunderbolt incarnate had No thought of anything that's bad: This concentrated earthquake stood And gave his mind to being good. Lightly and low he drew his breathâ This magazine of sudden death! All this the thrifty Wilson's glance Took in, and crying, âNow's my chance!â Upon the bull he sprang amain To put him in his churn. Again Rang out his battle-yell: âI'll spread This mammal on a slice of bread!â Sing, Muse, that battle-royalâsing The deeds that made that region ring: The blows, the bellowing, the cries, The dust that darkened all the skies, The thunders of the contest, all! Nay, none of these things did befall. A yell there wasâa rushâno more: El Toro, tranquil as before, Still stood there basking in the sun, Nor of his legs had shifted oneâ Stood there and conjured up his cud And meekly munched it. Scenes of blood Had little charm for him. His head He merely nodded as he said: âI've spread that butterman upon A slice of Southern Oregon.â THE GENESIS OF CRIME God said, âLet there be Crime,â and the command Brought Satan, leading Stoneman by the hand. âWhy, that's Stupidity, not Crime,â said Godâ âBring what I ordered.â Satan with a nod Replied, âThis is one elementâwhen I The otherâOpportunityâsupply In just equivalent, the two'll affine And in a chemical embrace combine And Crime result; for Crime can only be Stupiditate of Opportunity.â So leaving Stoneman (not as yet endowed With soul) in special session on a cloud, Nick to his sooty laboratory went, Returning soon with t'other element. âHere's Opportunity,â he said, and put Pen, ink and paper down at Stoneman's foot. He seized themâHeaven was filled with fires and thunders, And Crime was added to Creation's wonders! LLEWELLYN POWELL Villain, when the word is spoken, And your chains at last are broken; When the gibbet's chilling shade Ceases darkly to enfold you, And the angel who enrolled you As a master of the trade Of assassination sadly Blots the record he has made, And your name and title paints In the calendar of saints; When the devils, dancing madly In the midmost Hell, are very Multitudinously merryâ Then beware, beware, beware! Nemesis is everywhere! You shall hear her at your back, And, your hunted visage turning, Fancy that her eyes are burning Like a tiger's on your track! You shall hear her in the breeze Whispering to summer trees. You shall hear her calling, calling To your spirit through the storm When the giant billows form And the splintered lightning, falling Down the heights of Heaven, appalling, Splendors all the tossing seas! On your bed at night reclining, Stars into your chamber shining As they roll around the Pole, None their purposes divining, Shall appear to search your soul, And to gild the mark of Cain That burns into your tortured brain! And the dead man's eyes shall ever Meet your own wherever you, Desperate, shall turn you to, And you shall escape them never! By your heritage of guilt; By the blood that you have spilt; By the Law that you have broken; By the terrible red token That you bear upon your brow; By the awful sentence spoken And irrevocable vow Which consigns you to a living Death and to the unforgiving Furies who avenge your crime Through the periods of time; By that dread eternal doom Hinted in your future's gloom, As the flames infernal tell Of their power and perfection In their wavering reflection On the battlements of Hell; By the mercy you denied, I condemn your guilty soul In your body to abide, Like a serpent in a hole! THE SUNSET GUN Off Santa Cruz the western wave Was crimson as with blood: The sun was sinking to his grave Beneath that angry flood. Sir Walter Turnbull, brave and stout, Then shouted, âHo! lads; runâ The powder and the wad bring out To fire the sunset gun. âThat punctual orb did ne'er omit To keep, by land or sea, Its every engagement; it Shall never wait for me.â Behold the black-mouthed cannon stand, Ready with charge and prime, The lanyard in the gunner's hand. Sir Walter waits the time. The glowing orb sinks in the sea, And clouds of steam aspire, Then fade, and the horizon's free. Sir Walter thunders: âFire!â The gunner pullsâthe lanyard parts And not a sound ensues. The beating of ten thousand hearts Was heard at Santa Cruz! Off Santa Cruz the western wave Was crimson as with blood; The sun, with visage stern and grave, Came back from out the flood. THE âVIDUATE DAMEâ 'Tis the widow of Thomas Blythe, And she goeth upon the spree, And red are cheeks of the bystandÃ©rs For her acts are light and free. In a seven-ounce costÃºme The widow of Thomas Blythe, Y-perchÃ¨d high on the window ledge, The difficult can-can tryeth. Ten constables they essay To bate the dame's halloing. With the widow of Thomas Blythe Their hands are overflowing. And they cry: âCall the National Guard To quell this parlous mussâ For all the widows of Thomas Blythe Are upon the spree and us!â O long shall the eerie tale be told By that posse's surviving tithe; And with tears bedewed he'll sing this rude BallÃ d of the widow of Thomas Blythe. FOUR OF A KIND ROBERT F. MORROW Dear man! although a stranger and a foe To soft affection's humanizing glow; Although untaught how manly hearts may throb With more desires than the desire to rob; Although as void of tenderness as wit, And owning nothing soft but Maurice Schmitt; Although polluted, shunned and in disgrace, You fill me with a passion to embrace! Attentive to your look, your smile, your beck, I watch and wait to fall upon your neck. Lord of my love, and idol of my hope, You are my Valentine, and I'm A Rope. ALFRED CLARKE, JR. Illustrious son of an illustrious sireâ Entrusted with the duty to cry âFire!â And call the engines out, exert your power With care. When, looking from your lofty tower, You see a ruddy light on every wall, Pause for a moment ere you sound the call: It may be from a fire, it may be, too, From good men's blushes when they think of you. JUDGE RUTLEDGE Sultan of Stupids! with enough of brains To go indoors in all uncommon rains, But not enough to stay there when the storm Is past. When all the world is dry and warm, In irking comfort, lamentably gay, Keeping the evil tenor of your way, You walk abroad, sweet, beautiful and smug, And Justice hears you with her wonted shrug, Lifts her broad bandage half-an-inch and keeps One eye upon you while the other weeps. W. H. L. BARNES Happy the man who sin's proverbial wage Receives on the instalment planâin age. For him the bulldog pistol's honest bark Has naught of terror in its blunt remark. He looks with calmness on the gleaming steelâ If e'er it touched his heart he did not feel: Superior hardness turned its point away, Though urged by fond affinity to stay; His bloodless veins ignored the futile stroke, And moral mildew kept the cut in cloak. Happy the man, I say, to whom the wage Of sin has been commuted into age. Yet not quite happyâhark, that horrid cry!â His cruel mirror wounds him in the eye! RECONCILIATION Stanford and Huntington, so long at outs, Kissed and made up. If you have any doubts Dismiss them, for I saw them do it, man; And thenâwhy, then I clutched my purse and ran. A VISION OF CLIMATE I dreamed that I was poor and ill and sad, Broken in hope and weary of my life; My ventures all miscarryingânaught had For all my labor in the heat and strife. And in my heart some certain thoughts were rife Of an unsummoned exit. As I lay Considering my bitter state, I cried: âAlas! that hither I did ever stray. Better in some fair country to have died Than live in such a land, where Fortune never (Unless one be successful) crowns Endeavor.â Then, even as I lamented, lo! there came A troop of PresencesâI knew not whence Nor what they were: thought cannot rightly name What's known through spiritual evidence, Reported not by gross material sense. âWhy come ye here?â I seemed to cry (though naught My sleeping tongue did utter) to the firstâ âWhat are ye? with what woful message fraught? Ye have a ghostly look, as ye had burst Some sepulcher in memory. Weird creatures, I'm sure I'd know you if ye had but features.â Some subtle organ noted the reply (Inaudible to ear of flesh the tone): âThe Finest Climate in the World am I, From Siskiyou to San Diego knownâ From the Sierra to the sea. The zone Called semi-tropical I've pulled about And placed it where it does most good, I trust. I shake my never-failing bounty out Alike upon the just and the unjust.â âThat's very true,â said I, âbut when 'tis shaken My share by the unjust is ever taken.â âPermit me,â it resumed, ânow to present My eldest son, the Champagne Atmosphere, And others to rebuke your discontentâ The Mammoth Squash, Strawberry All the Year, The fair No Lightningâflashing only hereâ The Wholesome Earthquake and Italian Sky, With its Unstriking Sun; and last, not least, The Compos Mentis Dog. Now, ingrate, try To bring a better stomach to the feast: When Nature makes a dance and pays the piper, To be unhappy is to be a viper!â âWhy, yet,â said I, âwith all your blessings fine (And Heaven forbid that I should speak them ill) I'm poor and ill and sorrowful. Ye shine With more of splendor than of heat: for still, Although my will is warm, my bones are chill.â âThen warm you with enthusiasm's blazeâ Fortune waits not on toil,â they cried; âO then, Join the wild chorus clamoring our praiseâ Throw up your beaver and throw down your pen!â âBegone!â I shouted. They bewent, a-smirking, And I awakening, fell straight a-working. A âMASSâ MEETING It was a solemn rite as e'er Was seen by mortal man. The celebrants, the people there, Were all Republican. There Estee bent his grizzled head, And General Dimond, too, And oneâ'twas Reddick, some one said Though no one clearly knew. I saw the priest, white-robed and tall (Assistant, Father Stow)â He was the pious man men call Dan Burns of Mexico. Ah, 'twas a high and holy rite As any one could swear. âWhat does it mean?â I asked a wight Who knelt apart in prayer. âA mass for the repose,â he said, âOf Colonel Markham'sâââWhat, Is gallant Colonel Markham dead? 'Tis sad, 'tis sad, God wot!â âA massâârepeated he, and rose To go and kneel among The worshipersââfor the repose Of Colonel Markham's tongue.â THE NEW DENNIS Lo! Kearney, rising on his hinder legs, For higher rates of freight and passage begs. Time was when Dennis talked another wayâ Because he drove an opposition dray. Thus, soon or late, to override the laws All common carriers make common cause, Pool the foul issues of their dirty lungs, Lick each other with fraternal tongues. Crocker and Kearney, men of equal leather, Arcades amboâthey are pigs together. A RATIONAL ANTHEM My country, 'tis of thee, Sweet land of felony, Of thee I singâ Land where my fathers fried Young witches and applied Whips to the Quaker's hide And made him spring. My knavish country, thee, Land where the thief is free, Thy laws I love; I love thy thieving bills That tap the people's tills; I love thy mob whose will's All laws above. Let Federal employees And rings rob all they please, The whole year long. Let office-holders make Their piles and judges rake Our coin. For Jesus' sake, Let's all go wrong! INCIVISM âHe's no good citizen!â the crowd Of politicians cries aloud. âHow so?â says one. âBecauseâwhy, curse The man! while we deplete his purse Some air contentedly he hums, Or twiddles his incivic thumbs.â âWhat more could you desire?â âThe whelp! We want him to stand in and help.â âTwo crowds contend, his purse to twist Awayâpray which should he assist?â âIt matters not whose hand unsacks His shekels, for we all go snacks.â FAMINE IN PROSPERITY Two monks upon a field of battle Observed some lean and hungry cattle. Said one: âBut little feed is growing Where Death so lately has been mowing.â Replied the other, gravely eying The piles of dead about them lying: âAll flesh is grassâI'm quite confounded That cows should starve by hay surrounded.â AN EPIGRAMMATIST Once Hector Stuart in his tersest mood Took up his pencil. âBy the holy rood!â He cried, âI'll write an epigram.â He didâ Nay, by the holy mile his pencil slid. FIG LEAF (A Definition) An artist's trick by which the Nude's Protected from the eyes of prudes, Which else with their peculiar flame Might scorch the canvass in its frame, Or melt the bronze, or burn to lime The marble, in a minute's time. For sparks are sometimes seen to dance Where falls a dame's offended glance, And little curls of smoke to rise From fingers veiling virgin eyes. O prudes I know you,âonce you made Among us here a fool crusade Against some casts from the antique, Great, naked, natural and Greek, Whereto you flocked, a prurient crush, And diligently tried to blush, Half strangled in the vain attempt Till some one (may the wretch be hemped!) Depressed his lordly length of ear Your loud lubricity to hear, Then took his chisel up and dealt At Art a blow below the belt. Insulted, crimson with the shame, Her cheeks aglow, her eyes aflame, The goddess spread her pinions bright, Sprang, and the town was left in night! Since then in vain the painter toils: His canvass still repels the oils. In vain with melancholy sighs His burin the engraver plies; Lines multiply beneath his handâ Their meaning none can understand. With stubborn clay and unsubdued, The sculptor shapes his fancies crude, Unable to refine the work, And makes a god look like a Turk. To marble grown, or metal, still The monstrous image makes him ill, Till, crazed with rage, the damaged lot He breaks, or sells to Irving Scott. FOR PRESIDENT, LELAND STANFORD Mahomet Stanford, with covetous stare, Gazed on a vision surpassingly fair: Far on the desert's remote extreme A mountain of gold with a mellow gleam Reared its high pinnacles into the sky, The work of mirage to delude the eye. Pixley Pasha, at the Prophet's feet, Piously licking them, swearing them sweet, Ventured, observing his master's glance, To beg that he order the mountain's advance. Mahomet Stanford exerted his will, Commanding: âIn Allah's name, hither, hill!â Never an inch the mountain came. Mahomet Stanford, with face aflame, Lifted his foot and kicked, alack! Pixley Pasha on the end of the back. Mollified thus and smiling free, He said: âSince the mountain won't come to me, I'll go to the mountain.â With infinite pains, Camels in caravans, negroes in trains, Warriors, workmen, women, and fools, Food and water and mining tools He gathered about him, a mighty array, And the journey began at the close of day. All night they traveledâat early dawn Many a wearisome league had gone. Morning broke fair with a golden sheen, Mountain, alas, was nowhere seen! Mahomet Stanford pounded his breast, Pixley Pasha he thus addressed: âDog of mendacity, cheat and slave, May jackasses sing o'er your grandfather's grave!â FOR MAYOR O Abner Dobleâwhose âcatarrhal nameâ Budd of the same might envyâ'tis a rough Rude thing to say, but it is plain enough Your name is to be sneezed at: its acclaim Will âfill the speaking trump of future fameâ With an impeded utteranceâa puff Suggesting that a pinch or two of snuff Would clear the tube and somewhat disinflame. Nay, Abner Doble, you'll not get from me My voice and influence: I'll cheer instead, Some other man; for when my voice ascends a Tall pinnacle of praise, and at high C Sustains a chosen name, it shan't be said My influence is naught but influenza. A MINE FOR REFORMERS When God resolved to make the world He gathered all the matter In Chaos that was mixed and whirled In unassorted scatter. He separated that from this, And tagged on each a label, Naming all kinds of substances As far as he was able. He lacked of learning, though, enough To execute his aim, for There still remained a lot of stuff He hadn't any name for. And this (the world completed) lies Without concatenationâ All unassortedâand supplies Ideals for all Creation. IN PICKLE The journals say that the embalming done To Garfield's body badly was begun, Faultily finished all too soonâin short Was of a most unsatisfactory sort. Unsatisfactory? How so? To whom? Has the long sullen silence of the tomb At last been broken? Is rebellion's head Reared in the subject province of the dead? Unsatisfactory, forsooth! Who'd wish To satisfy, in salting it, a fish? With spices when the conscious cook supplies The autumnal mince-meat for the winter pies He makes no question if the meat prefer Clove, cinnamon or pepper, sage or myrrh. âThere was,â says Chowder if a clam upbraid, âNo thought of pleasing thee when I was made.â What! shall the dead with impudence complain Of how we've potted each inert remain?â The pickle criticise and even condemn, As if the purpose were to pleasure them? Their cure they rightly canvass in disease; We'll cure them after in what way we please. With blazing eulogies in crowded halls, And mourning emblems blackening the walls; With gorgeous funerals, both at the spot Where you were buried and where you were notâ A dummy funeral's inutile show Fifty to manifest a dummy woe; With black-ruled journals, selling all at twice The customary uneventful price; With guarded tomb and monument as fine As any light-house on the ocean lineâ Garfield, if still you are dissatisfied You might as profitably not have died. So you're complainingâvive la bagatelle! The brine, no doubt, was weak, and cheap as well, Got for a song an undertaker sang (We paid him for it through the noseâthe pang More keen than all our sorrow.) Even so, Your bones that served us for a public show Outlast already our unsalted woe. JAMES MONTAGUE, POET 'Tis said he wrote with wondrous ease, And that is here conceded; But anybody, if he please, Can write such verse as he did. Although for James 'twas easy quite, Another's difficulty might In self-defense be pleaded. A CHEATING PREACHER Munhall, to have my soul you bravely try, Although, to save my soul, I can't say why. 'Tis naught to you, to me however muchâ Why, bless it! you might save a million such, Yet lose your own; for still the âmeans of graceâ That you employ to turn us from the place By the arch-enemy of souls frequented Are those which to ensnare us he invented! I do not say you utter falsehoodsâI Would scorn to give to ministers the lie: They will not fightâtheir calling has estopped it. True, I did not persuade them to adopt it. But, Munhall, when you say the Devil dwells In all the breasts of all the infidelsâ Making a lot of individual Hells, You talk as I should if some world I trod Where lying is acceptable to God. I don't at all objectâforbid it Heaven!â That your discourse you temperately leaven With airy reference to wicked souls Cursing impenitent on glowing coals, Nor quarrel with your fancy, blithe and fine, Which represents the wickedest as mine. Each ornament of style my spirit eases: The subject saddens, but the manner pleases. But when you âdeal damnation roundâ 'twere sweet To think hereafter that you did not cheat. Deal, and let all accept what you allot 'em; But, blast you! you are dealing from the bottom! A CROCODILE Nay, Peter Robertson, 'tis not for you To blubber o'er Max Taubles for he's dead. By Heaven! my hearty, if you only knew How better is a grave-worm in the head Than brains like yoursâhow far more decent, too, A tomb in far Corea than a bed Where Peter lies with Peter, you would covet His happier state and, dying, learn to love it. In the recesses of the silent tomb No Maunderings of yours disturb the peace. Your mental bag-pipe, droning like the gloom Of Hades audible, perforce must cease From troubling further; and that crack o' doom, Your mouth, shaped like a long bow, shall release In vain such shafts of wit as it can utterâ The ear of death can't even hear them flutter. THE AMERICAN PARTY Oh, Marcus D. Boruck, me hearty, I sympathize wid ye, poor lad! A man that's shot out of his party Is mighty onlucky, bedad! An' the sowl o' that man is sad. But, Marcus, gossoon, ye dersarve itâ Ye know for yerself that ye do, For ye j'ined not intendin' to sarve it, But hopin' to make it sarve you, Though the roll of its members wuz two. The other wuz Pixley, an', âSurely,â Ye said, âhe's a kite that wull sail.â An' so ye hung till him securely, Enactin' the role of a tail. But there wuzn't the ghost of a gale! But the party to-day has behind it A powerful backin', I'm told; For just enough Irish have j'ined it (An' I'm m'anin' to be enrolled) To kick ye out into the cold. It's hard on ye, darlint, I'm thinkin'â So young, so American, too, Wid bypassers grinnin' an' winkin', An' sayin', wid ref'rence to you: âGet onto the murtherin' Joo!â Republicans never will take yeâ They had ye for many a year; An' Democratsâangels forsake ye!â If ever ye come about here We'll brand ye and scallop yer ear! UNCOLONELED Though war-signs fail in time of peace, they say, Two awful portents gloom the public mind: All Mexico is arming for the fray, And Colonel Mark McDonald has resigned! We know not by what instinct he divined The coming troubleâmaybe, like the steed Described by Job, he smelled the fight afar. Howe'er it be, he left, and for that deed Is an aspirant to the G. A. R. When cannon flame along the Rio Grande A citizen's commission will be handy. THE GATES AJAR The Day of Judgment spread its glare O'er continents and seas. The graves cracked open everywhere, Like pods of early peas. Up to the Court of Heaven sped The souls of all mankind; Republicans were at the head And Democrats behind. Reub Lloyd was there before the tube Of Gabriel could call: The dead in Christ rise first, and Reub Had risen first of all. He sat beside the Throne of Flame As, to the trumpet's sound, Four statesmen of the Party came And ranged themselves aroundâ Pure spirits shining like the sun, From taint and blemish freeâ Great William Stow was there for one, And George A. Knight for three. Souls less indubitably white Approached with anxious air, Judge Blake at head of them by right Of having been a Mayor. His ermine he had donned again, Long laid away in gums. 'Twas soiled a trifle by the stains Of politicians' thumbs. Then Knight addressed the Judge of Heaven: âYour Honor, would it trench On custom here if Blake were given A seat upon the Bench?â 'Twas done. âTom Shannon!â Peter cried. He came, without ado, In forma pauperis was tried, And was acquitted, too! Stow rose, remarking: âI concur.â Lloyd added: âThat suits us. I move Tom's nomination, sir, Be made unanimous.â TO A BULLY They say, George Perry, you're a lawyer. Well, At least that's your profession, but in fact, Law's like religion (though, the truth to tell, The likeness is not otherwise exact) In this, that in them both, my learned brother, Profession's one thing, practice quite another. But you do practice, for the other day I saw you mentioned in a case in court, Cross-questioning a witness. I must say You did it as a cat that loves to sport With an unworthy mouse all too unwilling To accept the justice of repeated killing. This witness, so the tale is told to me, Fatigued of your attempt upon his lifeâ I mean his reputationâmade him free With yours, affirming that you beat your wife. If that is true (they say that it upset you) She must be monstrous cowardly to let you! You hold it right to torture men who come (Heaven knows unwillingly) to aid the law, So that by terror of your tongue made dumb They can't tell rightly what they heard or saw, âImpeaching credibility,â you call it When, seeing an honest looking head, you maul it. Well, witnesses are fallibleâinvolved Sometimes in scandals; and 'tis true that they Are factors in the problem to be solved, The judge and jury led by what they say. But lawyersâthey are factors too, their problem Being foolish clients and how best to rob them. They've more to say than witnesses, and more Important 'tis that they be truthful, too. Were't not, then, right the witness take the floor And mercilessly cross-examine you? Were truth your jewel (bless us! what a setting!) I've certain questions that would set you sweating! Nay, don't be fidgeting; to ask them here Were perilous, for I no license hold To be a blackguard; and no judge is near To jail you for replies too sharp and bold. Besides, it were no easy task to shame you, And till I'm paid a fee I'll not defame you. You see I lack advantages that you Possess, and therefore cannot be so brave. Who has, and uses, them's respected; who Has not, yet bullies, is a scurril knaveâ Though, faith, the difference is narrow, very, By which a knave's distinguished from a Perry. You served, if rightly I remember, once A term in the State Legislature, where You figured merely as a harmless dunce, Save when, ambitious, in the larger air Of rhetoric you held the floor a season To give yourself for sin sufficient reason. Thus a great bird whose nature is in doubt With difficulty rises from the earth, His wide wings spreading with an effort out, And shows by his unconscionable girth E'er yet the agitated air insult your Resentful nose, he's but a glutted vulture. Touching these matters I would fain inquire If I but had you on the witness-grill, Over the slow but efficacious fire Of cross-examination; and I'd kill The worm with quite insensible gradation, And quench the fire with great deliberation. What, you're no worse than other lawyers? Well, I never said you were, my little man. Do you suppose I run this private Hell For one small soul? 'Tis your entire clan I'm trying to barbecue, despite their pleadings. Get out, you brat! you hamper the proceedings! A LAND FIGHT Great Dewey, mightiest of men, To sink or take a ship, Shows the white flag and feather when He hears the guns of Grip. Great Grip! Great Dewey! Oh, my heart, There's less tempestuous weather When they are leagues and leagues apart Than when they get together. The air is full of uniformâ Gold lace with buttons blent!â And then a voice succeeds the storm: âI've downed that festive gent.â Long shall the tale be told by brave And high-born cavaliers, And old Montojo from the grave Shall rise with all his ears. COMPLIANCE Said Rockefeller, senior, to his boy: âBe good and you shall have eternal joy.â Said Rockefeller, junior, to his dad: âI never do a single thing that's bad.â Said Rockefeller, seniorâlong gone gray In service at the altar: âEver pray.â And Rockefeller, junior, being bid, Upon his knees and neighbors ever did. ARBORICULTURE [Californians are asking themselves how Joaquin Miller will make the trees grow which he proposes to plant in the form of a Maltese cross on Goat Island, in San Francisco Bay.âNew York Graphic.] You may say they won't grow, and say they'll decayâ Say it again till you're sick of the say, Get up on your ear, blow your blaring bazoo And hire a hall to proclaim it; and you May stand on a stump with a lifted hand As a pine may stand or a redwood stand, And stick to your story and cheek it through. But I point with pride to the far divide Where the Snake from its groves is seen to glideâ To Mariposa's arboreal suit, And the shaggy shoulders of Shasta Butte, And the feathered firs of Siskiyou; And I swear as I sit on my marvelous hairâ I roll my marvelous eyes and swear, And sneer, and ask where would your forests be To-day if it hadn't been for me! Then I rise tip-toe, with a brow of brass, Like a bully boy with an eye of glass; I look at my gum-sprouts, red and blue, And I say it loud and I say it low: âThey know their man and you bet they'll grow!â A HOLIDAY 'Tis Master Barry, editor; He takes an holiday. Now wherefore, venerable sir, So resolutely gay? He lifts his head, he laughs aloud, Odzounds! 'tis drear to see! âBecause the Boodle-Scribbler crowd Will soon be far from me. âFull many a year I've striven well To freeze the caitiffs out By making this good town a Hell, But still they hang about. âThey maken mouths and eke they grin At the dollar limit game; And they are holpen in that sin By many a wicked dame. âIn sylvan bowers hence I'll dwell My bruised mind to ease. Farewell, ye urban scenes, farewell! Hail, unfamiliar trees!â Forth then did Master Barry hie, And all the country folk Besought him that he come not nigh The deadly poison oak! He smiled a cheerful smile (the day Was straightway overcast)â The poison oak along his way Was blighted as he passed! REJECTED When Dr. Charles O'Donnell died They sank a box with him inside. The plate with his initials three Was simply gravenââC. O' D.â That night two demons of the Pit Adown the coal-hole shunted it. Ten million leagues it fell, Alighting at the gate of Hell. Nick looked upon it with surprise, A night-storm darkening his eyes. âThey've sent this rubbish, C. O. D.â I'll never pay a cent!â said he. JUDEX JUDICATUS Judge Armstrong, when the poor have sought your aid, To be released from vows that they have made In haste, and leisurely repented, you, As stern as Rhadamanthus (Minos too, And Ãacus) have drawn your fierce brows down And petrified them with a moral frown! With iron-faced rigor you have made them run The gauntlet of publicityâeach Hun And Vandal of the public press allowed To throw their households open to the crowd And bawl their secret bickerings aloud. When Wealth before you suppliant appears, Bang! go the doors and open fly your ears! The blinds are drawn, the lights diminished burn, Lest eyes too curious should look and learn That gold refines not, sweetens not, a life Of conjugal brutality and strifeâ That vice is vulgar, though it gilded shine Upon the curve of a judicial spine. The veiled complainant's whispered evidence, The plain collusion and the no defense, The sealed exhibits and the secret plea, The unreported and unseen decree, The midnight signature andâchink! chink! chink!â Nay, pardon, upright Judge, I did but think I heard that sound abhorred of honest men; No doubt it was the scratching of your pen. O California! long-enduring land, Where Judges fawn upon the Golden Hand, Proud of such service to that rascal thing As slaves would blush to render to a kingâ Judges, of judgment destitute and heart, Of conscience conscious only by the smart From the recoil (with caution-bump enlarged) Of duty accidentally dischargedâ Invoking still a âsong o' sixpenceâ from The Scottish fiddle of each lusty palm,â Thy Judges, California, skilled to play This silent music, through the livelong day, Perform obsequious before the rich, And still the more they scratch the more they itch! ON THE WEDDING OF AN AERONAUT AÃ«ronaut, you're fairly caught, Despite your bubble's leaven: Out of the skies a lady's eyes Have brought you down to Heaven! No more, no more you'll freely soar Above the grass and gravel: Henceforth you'll walkâand she will chalk The line that you're to travel! A HASTY INFERENCE The Devil one day, coming up from the Pit All grimy with perspiration, Applied to Saint Peter and begged he'd admit Him a moment for consultation. The Saint showed him in where the Master reclined On the throne where petitioners sought him; Both bowed, and the Evil One opened his mind Concerning the business that brought him: âFor ten million years I've been kept in a stew Because you have thought me immoral; And though I have had my opinion of you, You've had the best end of the quarrel. âBut nowâwell, I venture to hope that the past With its misunderstandings we'll smother; And you, sir, and I, sir, be throned here at last As equals, the one to the other.â âIndeed!â said the Master (I cannot convey A sense of his tone by mere letters) âWhat makes you presume you'll be bidden to stay Up here on such terms with your betters?â âWhy, sure you can't mean it!â said Satan. âI've seen How Stanford and Crocker you've nourished, And Huntingtonâbless me! the three like a green Umbrageous great bay-tree have flourished. âThey are fat, they are rolling in gold, they command All sources and well-springs of power; You've given them houses, you've given them landâ Before them the righteous all cower.â âWhat of that?â âWhat of that?â cried the Father of Sin; âWhy, I thought when I saw you were winking At crimes such as theirs that perhaps you had been Converted to my way of thinking.â A VOLUPTUARY Who's this that lispeth in the thickening throng Which crowds to claim distinction in my song? Fresh from âthe palms and temples of the South,â The mixed aromas quarrel in his mouth: Of orange blossoms this the lingering gale, And that the odor of a spicy tale. Sir, in thy pleasure-dome down by the sea (No finer one did Kubla Khan decree) Where, Master of the Revels, thou dost stand With joys and mysteries on either hand, Dost keep a poet to report the rites And sing the tale of those Elysian nights? Faith, sir, I'd like the place if not too young. I'm no great bard, butâI can hold my tongue! AD CATTONUM I know not, Mr. Catton, who you are, Nor very clearly why; but you go far To show that you are many things beside A Chilean Consul with a tempting hide; But what they are I hardly could explain Without afflicting you with mental pain. Your name (gods! what a name the muse to wooâ Suggesting cats, and hinting kittens, too!) Points to an originâperhaps Maltese, Perhaps Angoranâwhere the wicked cease From fiddling, and the animals that grow The strings that groan to the tormenting bow Live undespoiled of their insides, resigned To give their name and nature to mankind. With Chilean birth your name but poorly tallies; The test isâDid you ever sell tamales? It matters very little, though, my boy, If you're from Chile or from Illinois; You can't, because you serve a foreign land, Spit with impunity on ours, expand Cock-turkeywise and strut with blind conceit, All heedless of the hearts beneath your feet, Fling falsehoods as a sower scatters grain And, for security, invoke disdain. Sir, there are laws that men of sense observe, No matter whence they come nor whom they serveâ The laws of courtesy; and these forbid You to malign, as recently you did, As servant of another State, a State Wherein your duties all are concentrate; Branding its Ministers as roguesâin short, Inviting cuffs as suitable retort. Chileno or American, 'tis oneâ Of any land a citizen, or noneâ If like a new Thersites here you rail, Loading with libels every western gale, You'll feel the cudgel on your scurvy hump Impinging with a salutary thump. 'Twill make you civil and 'twill make you jump! THE NATIONAL GUARDSMAN I'm a gorgeous golden hero And my trade is taking life Hear the twittle-twittle-tweero Of my sibillating fife And the rub-a-dub-a-dum Of my big bass drum! I'm an escort strong and bold, The Grand Army to protect. My countenance is cold And my attitude erect I'm a Californian Guard And my banner flies aloft, But the stones are O, so hard! And my feet are O, so soft! A REAR ELEVATION [He can speak with his eyes, his hands, arms, legs, body ânay, with his very bones, for he turned the broad of his back upon us in âConrad,â the other night, and his shoulder-blades spoke to us a volume of hesitation, fear, submission, desperationâeverything which could haunt a man at the moment of inevitable detection.â A âDramatic Critic.â] Once Moses (in Scripture the story is told) Entreated the favor God's face to behold. Compassion divine the petition denied Lest vision be blasted and body be fried. Yet this much, the Bible informs us, took place: Jehovah, concealing His terrible face, Protruded His rear from behind a great rock, Exodus xxxiii, 21â23. And edification ensued without shock. So godlike Salvini, lest worshipers die, Averting the blaze of his withering eye, Tempers his terrors and shows to the pack Of feeble adorers the end of his back. The fires of their altars, which paled and declined Before him, burn all the more brightly behind. O happy adorers, to care not at all Where fawning may tickle or lip-service fall! IN UPPER SAN FRANCISCO I heard that Heaven was bright and fair, And politicians dwelt not there. 'Twas said by knowing ones that they Were in the Elsewhereâso to say. So, waking from my last long sleep, I took my place among the sheep. I passed the gateâthough angels eyed Me sharply as I stepped inside. The new Jerusalemâah me, It was a sorry sight to see! The mansions of the blest were there, And mostly they were fine and fair; But O, such streets!âso deep and wide And all unpaved, from side to side! And in a public square there grew A blighted tree, most sad to view. From off its trunk the bark was rippedâ Its very branches all were stripped! An angel perched upon the fence With all the grace of indolence. âCelestial bird,â I cried in pain, âWhat vandal wrought this wreck? Explain.â He raised his eyelids as if tired: âWhat is a Vandal?â he inquired. âThis is the Tree of Life. 'Twas stripped By Durst and Siebe, who have shipped âThe bark across the Jordanâsee?â And sold it to a tannery.â âAlas,â I sighed, âtheir old-time tricks! That pavement, too, of golden bricksâ âThey've gobbled that?â But with a scowl, âYou greatly wrong them,â said the fowl: â'Twas Gilleran did that, I fearâ Head of the Street Department here.â âWhat! what!â cried Iââyou let such chaps Come here? You've Satan, too, perhaps.â âWe had him, yes, but off he went, Yet showed some purpose to repent; âBut since your priests and parsons filled The place with those their preaching killedââ (Here Siebe passed along, and Durst, Psalming as if their lungs would burst)â âHe swears his foot no more shall press Our soilâ'tis cloven, though, I guess. âIn short, the fellow's out on strikeâ But devils are not all alike.â Lo! Gilleran came down the street, Pressing the soil with broad, flat feet! NIMROD There were brave men, some one has truly said, Before Atrides (those were mostly dead Behind him) and long ages ere you were ActÃ¦on lived, Nimrod and Bahram-Gur. In strength and speed and daring they excelled: The stag they overtook, the lion felled. Ah, yes, great hunters flourished before you, Andâfor Munchausen livedâgreat talkers too. There'll be no more; there's much to kill, butâwell, You have left nothing in the world to tell! THE NEW DECALOGUE Have but one God: thy knees were sore If bent in prayer to three or four. Adore no images save those The coinage of thy country shows. Take not the Name in vain. Direct Thy swearing unto some effect. Thy hand from Sunday work be heldâ Work not at all unless compelled. Honor thy parents, and perchance Their wills thy fortunes may advance. Kill notâdeath liberates thy foe From persecution's constant woe. Kiss not thy neighbor's wife. Of course There's no objection to divorce. To steal were folly, for 'tis plain In cheating there is greater gain. Bear not false witness. Shake your head And say that you have âheard it said.â Who stays to covet ne'er will catch An opportunity to snatch. ULTRA CREPIDAM [I think there must be some misunderstanding regarding my reference to the Catholic Church in the Philippines in my address at the Stanford University.â Gen. Funston.] A misunderstanding? Why, that's a great scandal! So stick to the weapon you know how to handle. The tongue is a very uncertain convincer; Don't draw it at allâkeep it in, keep it in, sir. I never have heard it was any great labor To dig out your meaning when swinging your sabre. Even dull Filipino (ah, green be the bed of him!) Can manage to get it somehow through the head of him. CENSOR LITERARUM So, Parson Stebbins, you've released your chin To say that here, and here, we press-folk ail. 'Tis a great thing an editor to skin And hang his faulty pelt upon a nail (If over-eared, it has, at least, no tail) And, for an admonition against sin, Point out its maculations with a rod, And act, in short, the gentleman of God. 'Twere needless cruelty to spoil your sport By comment, critical or merely rude; But you, too, have, according to report, Despite your posing as a holy dude, Imperfect spiritual pulchritude For so severe a judge. May't please the court, We shall appeal and take our case at once Before that higher court, a taller dunce. Sir, what were you without the press? What spreads The fame of your existence, once a week, From the Pacific Mail dock to the Heads, Warning the people you're about to wreak Upon the human ear your Sunday freak?â Whereat the most betake them to their beds, Though some prefer to slumber in the pews And nod assent to your hypnotic views. Unhappy man! can you not still your tongue When (like a luckless brat afflict with worms, By cruel fleas intolerably stung, Or with a pang in its small lap) it squirms? Still must it vulgarize your feats of lung? There were no better preachering beneath The sun if you'd naught there behind your teeth. BORROWED BRAINS Writer folk across the bay Take the pains to see and sayâ All their upward palms in air: âJoaquin Miller's cut his hair!â Hasten, hasten, writer folkâ In the gutters rake and poke, If by God's exceeding grace You may hit upon the place Where the barber threw at length Samson's literary strength. Find it, find it if you can; Happy the successful man! He has but to put one strand In his beaver's inner band And his intellect will soar As it never did before! While an inch of it remains He will noted be for brains, And at last ('twill so befall) Fit to cease to write at all. YE FYGHTYNGE SEVENTH It is the gallant Seventhâ It fyghteth faste and free! God wot the where it fyghteth I ne desyre to be. The Gonfalon it flyeth, Seeming a Flayme in Sky; The Bugel loud yblowen is, Which sayeth, Doe and dye! And (O good Saints defende us Agaynst the Woes of Warr) Drawn Tongues are flashing deadly To smyte the Foeman sore! With divers kinds of Riddance. The smoaking Earth is wet, And all aflowe to seaward goe The Torrents wide of Sweat! The Thunder of the Captens, And eke the Shouting, mayketh Such horrid Din the Soule within The boddy of me quayketh! Whom fyghteth the bold Seventh? What haughty Power defyes? Their Colonel 'tis they drubben sore, And dammen too his Eyes! INDICTED Dear Bruner, once we had a little talk (That is to say, 'twas I did all the talking) About the manner of your moral walk: How devious the trail you made in stalking, On level ground, your law-protected gameâ âAnother's Dollarâ is, I think, its name. Your crooked course more recently is not So blamable; for, truly, you have stumbled On evil days; and 'tis your luckless lot To traverse spaces (with a spirit humbled, Contrite, dejected and divinely sad) Where, 'tis confessed, the walking's mighty bad. Jordan, the song says, is a road (I thought It was a river) that is hard to travel; And Dublin, if you'd find it, must be sought Along a highway with more rocks than gravel. In difficulty neither can compete With that wherein you navigate your feet. As once George Gorham said of Pixley, so I say of you: âThe prison yawns before you, The turnkey stalks behind!â Now will you goâ Or lag, and let that functionary floor you? To change the metaphorâyou seem to be Between Judge Wallace and the deep, deep sea! OVER THE BORDER O Justice, you have fled, to dwell In Mexico, unstrangled, Lest you should hang as high asâwell, As Haman dangled. (I know not if his cord be twanged, Or the King proved forgiving. 'Tis hard to think of Haman hanged, And Haymond living.) Yes, as I said: in mortal fear To Mexico you journeyed; For you were on your trial here, And ill attorneyed. The law had long regarded you As an extreme offender. Religion looked upon you, too, With thoughts untender. The Press to you was cold as snow, For sin you'd always call so. In Politics you were de trop, In Morals also. All this is accurately true And, faith! there might be more said; Butâwell, to save your thrapple you Fled, as aforesaid. You're down in Mexicoâthat's plain As that the sun is risen; For Daniel Burns down there his chain Drags round in prison. TO AN INSOLENT ATTORNEY So, Hall McAllister, you'll not be warnedâ My protest slighted, admonition scorned! To save your scoundrel client from a cell As loth to swallow him as he to swell Its sum of meals insurgent (it decries All wars intestinal with meats that rise) You turn your scurril tongue against the press And damn the agency you ought to bless. Had not the press with all its hundred eyes Discerned the wolf beneath the sheep's disguise And raised the cry upon him, he to-day Would lack your company, and you would lack his pay. Talk not of âhireâ and consciences for saleâ You whose profession 'tis to threaten, rail, Calumniate and libel at the will Of any villain who can pay the bill,â You whose most honest dollars all were got By saying for a fee âthe thing that's not!â To you 'tis one, to challenge or defend; Clients are means, their money is an end. In my profession sometimes, as in yours Always, a payment large enough secures A mercenary service to defend The guilty, or the innocent to rend. But mark the difference, nor think it slight: We do not hold it proper, just and right; Of selfish lies a little still we shame And give our villainies another name. Hypocrisy's an ugly vice, no doubt, But blushing sinners can't get on without. Happy the lawyer!âat his favored hands Nor truth nor decency the world demands. Secure in his immunity from shame, His cheek ne'er kindles with the tell-tale flame. His brains for sale, morality for hire, In every land and century a licensed liar! No doubt, McAllister, you can explain How honorable 'tis to lie for gain, Provided only that the jury's made To understand that lying is your trade. A hundred thousand volumes, broad and flat, (The Bible not included) proving that, Have been put forth, though still the doubt remains If God has read them with befitting pains. No Morrow could get justice, you'll declare, If none who knew him foul affirmed him fair. Ingenious man! how easy 'tis to raise An argument to justify the course that pays! I grant you, if you like, that men may need The services performed for crime by greed,â Grant that the perfect welfare of the State Requires the aid of those who in debate As mercenaries lost in early youth The fine distinction between lie and truth,â Who cheat in argument and set a snare To take the feet of Justice unaware,â Who serve with livelier zeal when rogues assist With perjury, embracery (the list Is long to quote) than when an honest soul, Scorning to plot, conspire, intrigue, cajole, Reminds them (their astonishment how great!) He'd rather suffer wrong than perpetrate. I grant, in short, 'tis better all around That ambidextrous consciences abound In courts of law to do the dirty work That self-respecting scavengers would shirk. What then? Who serves however clean a plan By doing dirty work, he is a dirty man! ACCEPTED Charles Shortridge once to Saint Peter came. âDown!â cried the saint with his face aflame; â'Tis written that every hardy liar Shall dwell forever and ever in fire!â âThat's what I said the night that I died,â The sinner, turning away, replied. âWhat! you said that?â cried the saintââwhat! what! You said 'twas so writ? Then, faith, 'tis not! I'm a devil at quoting, but, faith, I begin To fail in my memory. Pray walk in.â A PROMISED FAST TRAIN I turned my eyes upon the Future's scroll And saw its pictured prophecies unroll. I saw that magical life-laden train Flash its long glories o'er Nevada's plain. I saw it smoothly up the mountain glide. âO happy, happy passengers!â I cried. For Pleasure, singing, drowned the engine's roar, And Hope on joyous pinions flew before. Then dived the train adown the sunset slopeâ Pleasure was silent and unseen was Hope. Crashes and shrieks attested the decay That greed had wrought upon that iron way. The rusted rails broke down the rotting ties, And clouds of flying spikes obscured the skies. My coward eyes I drew away, distressed, And fixed them on the terminus to-West, Where soon, its melancholy tale to tell, One bloody car-wheel wabbled in and fell! FROM THE DEATH-COLUMN âOpen wide, ye golden gates That lead to the heavenly shore: Our father suffered in passing through, And mother weighs still more.â âOur papa dear has gone to heaven To make arrangements for eleven.â âThe winter's snow Congealed his form, But now we know Our uncle's warm.â âWe can but mourn our loss, Though wretched was his life. Death took him from the crossâ Erected by his wife.â âWeep not, mother: little Will Is gone to Upper Louisville.â THE FARMERS' PRAYER O Lord, incline Thine ear unto our prayer And preachers' intercession: This strange discrimination is unfairâ That's our impression. Our neighbors all about have copious rains That fall on them like manna. Send us the showers, Lord, and parch the plains Of Indiana. Upon the just and unjust, sayest Thou, Thou'lt sprinkle without favor. The sin of promise-breaking, all allow, Could not be graver. We're just, and still our whistles are not wet, And still 'tis growing hotter; While every scamp in Michigan can get His fill of water. We ask but justice: treat us not with scorn; Our comfort make less chilly; And those who pray for an advance in cornâ O smite them silly! Let corn be plentiful, and cheap: our hops Look well without a shower; We've sold our wheat: that profitable crop's Beyond Thy power. ONE OF THE SAINTS Big Smith is an Oakland School Board man, And he looks as good as ever he can; And he's such a cold and a chaste Big Smith That snowflakes all are his kin and kith. Wherever his eye he chances to throw The crystals of ice begin to grow, And the fruits and flowers he sees are lost By the singeing touch of a sudden frost. The women all shiver whenever he's near, And look upon us with a look austereâ Effect of the Smithian atmosphere. Such, in a word, is the moral plan Of the Big, Big Smith, the School Board man. When told that Madame Ferrier had taught Hernani in school, his fist he brought Like a trip-hammer down on his bulbous knee, And he roared: âHer Nanny? By gum, we'll see If the public's time she dares devote To the educatin' of any dam goat!â âYou do not entirely comprehendâ Hernani's a play,â said his learned friend, âBy Victor Hugoâimmoral and bad. What's worse, it's French!â âWell, well, my lad,â Said Smith, âif he cuts a swath so wide I'll have him took re'glar up and tried.â And he smiled so sweetly the other chap Thought that himself was a Finn or Lapp Caught in a storm of his native snows, With a purple ear and an azure nose. The Smith continued: âI never pursue Immoral readin'.â And that is true: He's a saint of remarkably high degree, With a mind as chaste as a mind can be; But read!âthe devil a word can he. A MILITARY INCIDENT Dawn heralded the coming sunâ For Douglas was computing The minuteâand the sunrise gun Was manned for his saluting. The gunner at that firearm stood, The which he slowly loaded, When, bang!âI know not how it could, But sure the charge exploded! Yes, to that veteran's surprise The gun went off sublimely, And both his busy arms likewise Went off with it, untimely. Then said that gunner to his mate (He was from Ballyshannon): âBedad, the sun's a minute late, Accardin' to this cannon!â SUBSTANCE OR SHADOW So, gentle critics, you would have me tilt, Not at the guilty, only at their guilt!â Spare the offender and condemn Offense, And make life miserable to Pretense! âWhip Vice and Follyâthat is satire's useâ But be not personal, for that's abuse; Nor e'er forget what, âlike a razor keen, Wounds with a touch that's neither felt nor seen.ââ Well, friends, I venture, destitute of awe, To think that razor but an old, old saw, A trifle rusty; and a wound, I'm sure, That's felt not, seen not, one can well endure. Go to! go to!âyou're as unfitted quite To give advice to writers as to write. I find in Folly and in Vice a lack Of head to stirke, and for the lash no back, Whilst Pixley has a pow that's easy struck. And though good Deacon Fitch (a Fitch for luck!) Has none, yet, lest he go entirely free, God gave to him a corn, a heel to me. He, also, sets his face (so like a flint The wonder grows that Pickering doesn't skin't) With cold austerity, against these wars On scampsâ'tis Scampery that he abhors! Behold advances in dignity and stateâ Grave, smug, serene, indubitably greatâ Stanford, philanthropist! One hand bestows In alms what t'other one to justice owes. Rascality attends him like a shade, But closes, woundless, o'er my baffled blade, Its limbs unsevered, spirit undismayed. Faith! I'm for something can be made to feel, If, like Pelides, only in the heel. The fellow's self invites assault; his crimes Will each bear killing twenty thousand times! Anon Creed Haymondâbut the list is long Of names to point the moral of my song. Rogues, fools, impostors, sycophants, they rise; They foul the earth and horrify the skiesâ With Collis Huntington (sole honest man In all the reek of that rapscallion clan) Denouncing Theft as hard as e'er he can! THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC MORALS The Senate met in Sacramento city; On public morals it had no committee, Though greatly these abounded. Soon the quiet Was broken by the Senators in riot. Now, at the end of their infectious quarrels, There's a committee but no public morals. A PLAYWRIGHT Saint Peter, sitting at the Gate of Gold, Looked idly down the cloudway and, behold, A soul ascending from this world of woe, Head up, hands pocketedâserene and bold! (To souls, such pockets are, I know, denied As in the flesh we wear on either side, But the dead richâor else they wouldn't playâ With souls of perished pockets are supplied.) âAh, Harrison,â the Saint saidââWilliam Greer, 'Twill do you little good to come, I fear; I've certain crows to pick with youâand, first, You were a âpatron of the ring,â I hear.â Nodding and smirking, said the soul: âThat's right; Nothing so charmed me as to see a fight. But pray observe that as a man of peace, Meek under challenge, I was âout of sightâ!â To this the Saint made answer: âAlthough gay, You were not reckless; but, my friend, they say Youâwhat the devil was it that you did? Ah, once you wrote, I understand, a play. âYou had the right to do so, 'tis agreed; The Ring and Stage are near akin, indeed, With you to write and Sullivan to act. But, sir, the play you wrote was âRunnymedeâ!â âWell?â âWorst I ever saw!â The pride alurk In authorship flashed forth, and like a dirk That seeks a heart the cutting answer came: âI guess you haven't seen my later work.â âWhat? you impenitent, you've written since?â The Warder thundered, making William wince. âOnly to lie about my critics, please. Of liarsâbar Sam ChamberlainâI'm Prince!â The Saint drew back his great two-handed key And, as the nude immortal turned to flee, Swung the big engine of his holy wrath, And smote him where the back forgets to be! All Heaven resounded with the dreadful blow, And Echo babbled of it down below! To farthest reaches of the shoreless void Raced the receding sound-waves of his âO!â Rubbing the part with many a grimace, He said while hurtling Sheolward through space: âPoor old Saint Peter!â and with a blue grin Added: âThat Paradise is a jay place.â THE LEADER OF THE MINORITY He tolls them along through the wilderness dire, Ever in sightâ A clod by day and a pillar of fire- Water by night. CALIFORNIA [The Chinaman's Assailant was allowed to walk quietly away, although the street was filled with pedestrians. âNewspaper.] Why should he not have been allowed To thread with peaceful feet the crowd That filled that Christian street? The Decalogue he had observed, From Faith in Jesus had not swerved, And scorning pious platitudes, He saw in the Beatitudes A lamp to guide his feet. He knew that Jonah downed the whale And made no bones of it. The tale That Ananias told He swore was true. He had no doubt That Daniel laid the lions out. In short, he had all holiness, All meekness and all lowliness, And was with saints enrolled. 'Tis true, some slight excess of zeal A little to promote the weal Of this most Christian state Had moved him rudely to divide The queue that was a pagan's pride, And in addition certify The Faith by making fur to fly From pelt as well as pate. But, Heavenly Father, thou dost know That in this town these actions go For nothing worth a name. Nay, every editorial ass, To prove they never come to pass Will damn his soul eternally, Although in his own journal he May read the printed shame. From bloody hands the reins of pow'r Fall slack; the high-decisive hour Strikes not for liars' ears. Remove, O Father, the disgrace That stains our California's face, And consecrate to human good The strength of her young womanhood And all her golden years! GEORGE C. PERKINS Running for Senator with clumsy pace, He stooped so low to win the foremost place That Fortune, tempted by a mark so droll, Sprang in and kicked him to the winning pole. TO EITHER Back farther than I know, in San Francisco dwelt a wealthy man. So rich was he That none could be Wise, good and great in like degree. 'Tis true he wrought, In deed or thought, But few of all the things he ought; But men said: âWho Would wish him to? Great souls are born to be, not do!â One thing, indeed, He did, we read, Which was becoming, all agreed: Grown provident, Ere life was spent He built a mighty monument. For longer than I know, in San Francisco lived a beggar man; And when in bed They found him deadâ âJust like the scamp!â the people said. He died, they say, On the same day His wealthy neighbor passed away. But matters it When beggars quit Their beats? I answer: Not a bit. They got a spade And pick and made A hole, and there the chap was laid. âHe asked for bread,â 'Twas neatly said: âHe'll get not even a stone instead.â The years rolled round: His humble mound Sank to the level of the ground; And men forgot That the bare spot Was (and was like) the beggar's lot. Forgotten, too, Was t'other, who Had reared the monument to woo Inconstant Fame, Though still his name Shouted in granite just the same. That name, I swear, They both did bear The beggar and the millionaire. That lofty tomb, Then, honoredâwhom? For argument here's ample room. DISAPPOINTMENT The Senate woke; the Chairman's snore Was stilled, its echoes balking; The startled members dreamed no more, For Steele, who long had held the floor, Had suddenly ceased talking. As, like Elijah, in his pride, He to his seat was passing, âGo up thou baldhead!â Reddy cried, Then six fierce bears ensued and tried To sunder him for âsassing.â Two seized his legs, and one his head, The fourth his trunk, to munch on; The fifth preferred an arm instead; The sixth with rueful visage, said: âPray what have I for luncheon?â Then to that disappointed bear Said Steele, serene and chipper, âMy friend, you shall not lack your share: Look in the Treasury, and there You'll find his other flipper.â THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF THEFT In fair Yosemite, that den of thieves Wherein the minions of the moon divide The travelers' purses, lo! the Devil grieves, His larger share as leader still denied. El Capitan, foreseeing that his reign May be disputed too, beclouds his head. The joyous Bridal Veil is torn in twain And a crÃªpe streamer dangles there instead. The Vernal Fall abates her pleasant speed And hesitates to take the final plunge, For rumors reach her that another greed Awaits her in the Valley of the Sponge. The Brothers envy the accord of mind And peace of purpose (by the good deplored As honor among Commissioners) which bind That confraternity of crime, the Board. The Half-Dome bows his riven head to weep, But not, as formerly, because bereft: Prophetic dreams afflict him when asleep Of losing his remaining half by theft. Ambitious knaves! has not the upper sod Enough of room for every crime that crawls But you must loot in Palaces of God And daub your filthy names upon the walls? DOWN AMONG THE DEAD MEN Within my dark and narrow bed I rested well, new-laid: I heard above my fleshless head The grinding of a spade. A gruffer note ensued and grew To harsh and harsher strains: The poet Bashford then I knew Was âsnatchingâ my remains. âO poet, let your hand be stayed And leave me here in peace. Of your revenge you should have made And end with my decease.â âHush, Mouldyshanks, and hear my moan: I once, as you're aware, Was eminent in lettersâknown And honored everywhere. âMy splendor made Milpitas bright And San Francisco blind. Men swore no writer e'er could write Like meâif I'd a mind. âWith honors all insatiate, With curst ambition smit, Too far, alas! I tempted fateâ I published what I'd writ! âGood Heavens! with what a hunger wild Oblivion swallows fame! Men who have known me from a child Forget my very name! âEven creditors with searching looks My face cannot recall; My heaviest oneâhe prints my booksâ Forgetful most of all. âO I should feel a sweet content If one poor dun his claim Would bring to me for settlement, And bully me by name. âMy dog is at my gate forlorn; It howls through all the night, And when I greet it in the morn It answers with a bite!â âO poet, what in Satan's name To me's all this ado? Will snatching me restore the fame That printing snatched from you?â âPeace, dread Remains; I'm not about To do a deed of sin. I come not here to hale you outâ I'm trying to get in.â THE LAST MAN I dreamed that Gabriel took his horn On Resurrection's fateful morn, And lighting upon Laurel Hill Blew long, blew loud, blew high and shrill. The houses compassing the ground Rattled their windows at the sound, But no one rose. âAlas!â said he, âWhat lazy-bones these mortals be!â Again he plied the horn, again Deflating both his lungs in vain; Then stood astonished and chagrined At raising nothing but the wind. At last he caught the tranquil eye Of an observer standing byâ Last of mankind, not doomed to die. To him thus Gabriel: âSir, I pray This mystery you'll clear away. Why do I sound my note in vain? Why spring they not from out the plain? Where's Luning, Blythe and Michael Reese, Magee, who ran the Golden Fleece? Where's Asa Fisk? Jim Phelan, who Was thought to know a thing or two Of land which rose but never sank? Where's Con O'Conor of the Bank, And all who consecrated lands Of old by laying on of hands? I ask of them because their worth Was known in all they wishedâthe earth. Brisk boomers once, alert and wise, Why don't they rise, why don't they rise?â The man replied: âReburied long With others of the shrouded throng In San Mateoâcarted there And dumped promiscuous, anywhere, In holes and trenchesâall misfitsâ Mixed up with one another's bits: One's back-bone with another's shin, A third one's skull with a fourth one's grinâ Your eye was never, never fixed Upon a company so mixed! Go now among them there and blow: 'Twill be as good as any show To see them, when they hear the tones, Compiling one another's bones! But here 'tis vain to sound and wait: Naught rises here but real estate. I own it all and shan't disgorge. Don't know me? I am Henry George.â ARBOR DAY Hasten, children, black and whiteâ Celebrate the yearly rite. Every pupil plant a tree: It will grow some day to be Big and strong enough to bear A School Director hanging there. THE PIUTE Unbeautiful is the Piute! Howe'er bedecked with bravery, His person is unsavoryâ Of soap he's destitute. He multiplies upon the earth In spite of all admonishing; All censure his astonishing And versatile unworth. Upon the Reservation wide We give for his inhabiting He goes a-jackass rabbiting To furnish his inside. The hopper singing in the grass He seizes with avidity: He loves its tart acidity, And gobbles all that pass. He penetrates the spider's veil, Industriously pillages The toads' defenseless villages, And shadows home the snail. He lightly runs to earth the faint Red worm and, deftly troweling, He makes it with his boweling Familiarly acquaint. He tracks the pine-nut to its lair, Surrounds it with celerity, Regards it with asperityâ Smiles, and it isn't there! I wish he'd open up a grin Of adequate vivacity And carrying capacity To take his Agent in. FAME He held a book in his knotty paws, And its title grand read he: âThe Chronicles of the Kingsâ it was, By the History Companee. âI'm a monarch,â he said (But a tear he shed) âAnd my picter here you see. âGreat and lasting is my renown, However the wits may floutâ As wide almost as this blessed townâ (But he winced as if with gout.) âI paid 'em like sin For to put me in, But it's O, and O, to be out!â ONE OF THE REDEEMED Saint Peter, standing at the Gate, beheld A soul whose body Death had lately felled. A pleasant soul as ever was, he seemed: His step was joyous and his visage beamed. âGood morning, Peter.â There was just a touch Of foreign accent, but not overmuch. The Saint bent gravely, like a stately tree, And said: âYou have the advantage, sir, of me.â âRÃ©nan of Paris,â said the immortal partâ âA master of the literary art. âI'm somewhat famous, too, I grieve to tell, As controversialist and infidel.â âThat's of no consequence,â the Saint replied, âWhy, I myself my Master once denied. âNo one up here cares anything for that. But is there nothing you were always at? âIt seems to me you were accused one day Of somethingâwhat it was I can't just say.â âQuite likely,â said the other; âbut I swear My life was irreproachable and fair.â Just then a soul appeared upon the wall, Singing a hymn as loud as he could bawl. About his head a golden halo gleamed, As well befitted one of the redeemed. A harp he bore and vigorously thumbed, Strumming he sang, and, singing, ever strummed. His countenance, suffused with holy pride, Glowed like a pumpkin with a light inside. âAh! that's the chap,â said Peter, âwho declares: âRÃ©nan's a rake and drunkardâsmokes and swears.â âYes, that's the fellowâhe's a preacherâcame From San Francisco. Mansfield was his name.â âDo you believe him?â said RÃ©nan. âGreat Scott! Believe? Believe the blackguard? Of course not! âJust walk right in and make yourself at home, And if he pecks at you I'll cut his comb. âHe's only here because the Devil swore He wouldn't have him, for the smile he wore.â Resting his eyes one moment on that proof Of saving grace, the Frenchman turned aloof, And stepping down from cloud to cloud, said he: âThank you, monsieur,âI'll see if he'll have me.â A CRITIC [Apparently the Cleveland Leader is not a good judge of poetry. âThe Morning Call.] That from you, neighbor! to whose vacant lot Each rhyming literary knacker scourges His cart-compelling Pegasus to trot, As folly, vanity or famine urges? Admonished by the stimulating goad, How gaily, lo! the spavined crow-bait prancesâ Its cart before itâeager to unload The dead-dog sentiments and swill-tub fancies. Gravely the sweating scavenger pulls out The tail-board of his curst imagination, Shoots all his rascal rubbish and, no doubt, Thanks Fortune for so good a dumping-station. To improve your property, the vile cascade Your thrift invitesâto make a higher level. In vain: with tons of garbage overlaid, Your baseless bog sinks slowly to the devil. âRubbish may be shot hereââfamiliar sign! I seem to see it in your every column. You have your wish, but, sir, if I had mine 'Twould to your editors mean something solemn. A QUESTION OF ELIGIBILITY It was a bruised and battered chap The victim of some dire mishap, Who sat upon a rock and spent His breath in this ungay lament: âSome warsâI've frequent heard of suchâ Has beat the everlastin' Dutch! But never fight was fit by man To equal this which has began In our (I'm in it, if you please) Academy of Sciences. For there is various gents belong To it which go persistent wrong, And loving the debate's delight Calls one another names at sight. Their disposition, too, accords With fighting like they all was lords! Sech impulses should be withstood: 'Tis scientific to be good. â'Twas one of them, one night last week, Rose up his figure for to speak: âPlease, Mr. Chair, I'm holding here A resolution which, I fear, Some ancient fossils that has bust Their cases and shook off their dust To sit as members here will find Unpleasant, not to say unkindâ. And then he read it every word, And silence fell on all which heard. That resolution, wild and strange, Proposed a fundamental change, Which was that idiots no more Could join us as they had before! âNo sooner was he seated than The members rose up, to a man. Each chap was primed with a reply And tried to snatch the Chairman's eye. They stomped and shook their fists in air, And, O, what words was uttered there! âThe Chair was silent, but at last He hove up his proportions vast And stilled them tumults with a look By which the undauntedest was shook. He smiled sarcastical and said: âIf Argus was the Chair, instead Of me, he'd lack enough of eyes Each orator to recognize! And since, denied a hearing, you Might maybe undertake to do Each other harm before you cease, I've took some steps to keep the peace: I've ordered outâalas, alas, That Science e'er to such a pass Should come!âI've ordered outâthe gas!â âO if a tongue or pen of fire Was mine I could not tell entire What the ensuin' actions was! When swollered up in darkness' jaws We fit and fit and fit and fit, And everything we felt we hit! We gouged, we scratched and we pulled hair, And O, what words was uttered there! And when at last the day dawn came Three hundred Scientists was lame; Two hundred others couldn't stand, They'd been so careless handled, and One thousand at the very least Was spread upon the floor deceased! 'Twere easy to exaggerate, But lies is things I mortal hate. âSuch, friends, is the disaster sad Which has befell the Cal. Acad. And now the question is of more Importance than it was before: Shall vacancies among us be To idiots threw open free?â FLEET STROTHER What! you were born, you animated doll, Within the shadow of the Capitol? 'Twas always thought (and history so assures Its trusting readers) it was reared in yours. RECIPROCITY The night was dark, the way was steep: I scarcely, for fatigue, could creep. âFatigue, begone!â I cried. Not so; It tarried and would not bego. At length the last wan glimmer died, Of hope that lit up my inside. I let go all, and thought to sink Back, headlong, from the mountain's brink. But ere I fell my startled eyes Beheld a wonder in the skies. I grasped again a friendly tree, To stay me till I more could see. (When shows are free that men admire 'Tis most unthrifty to expire.) Seven clustered planets rose as one; Their light was like another sun! Straight upward to the zenith they, Without defection, held their way. Then paused, revealing with their light A massive building on the height. Before my very eyes its face It reared; my feet were at its base, And well I knew that I had clomb To Lick's renowned memorial dome, Where Holden's mammoth tube betrays The stellar gambols to his gaze. With lifted brow and heart elate I entered by the stranger's gate. Smit with a reverential awe, The great man's figure there I saw. He sat bolt upright in a chairâ Legs crossed, arms folded and head bare. No king that I had ever seen (Nor surely any jack nor queen) Had ever on a golden throne With such a gracious aspect shone. The giant telescope, reversed, Seemed diving from the sky head first! Its broader end remained at rest Within two yards of Holden's breast. âO mighty scientist,â I cried, âLet me beneath this dome abide. âThe night is bad, and o'er your roof Seven crazy planets are aloof. âThe trails are terrors to my shanks; I dread the planetary pranks!â He deigned no word, but gave the nod, That sign of an assenting god. Meantime the telescope's great eye With splendor smote him, hip and thigh. It seethed him in a lambent light, Sharp, searching, glorious and white! âIllustrious man,â I said again, âThis mystery I pray explain. âWhy is the glass reversed, and why Are you in session 'neath its eye? â'Tis little that I know of stars, And Venus is to me as Mars; âBut, pardon me, I know aright How gentlemen should pass the night.â That great professor smiled, and O, The smile was light and cold as snow! âKnow, then,â he said âthat what you view Is payment of a debt long due. âFor years I've watched the planets roll, And mapped the stars from pole to pole. â'Tis true I once, the people say, Charted the lights of San Jose, âBut, generally speaking, I Can tell the valley from the sky. âThose planets up in Heaven's high cope I long have studied through the 'scope. âFair play's a jewel, and to-night Their observation I invite. âI turn the tube and, as you see, Permit them now to study Me.â Next morn as on my way I sped, âI've seen a just, good man,â I said. CALIFORNIAN SUMMER PICTURES THE FOOT-HILL RESORT Assembled in the parlor Of the place of last resort, The smiler and the snarler And the guests of every sortâ The elocution chap With rhetoric on tap; The mimic and the funny dog; The social sponge; the money-hog; Vulgarian and dude; And the prude; The adiposing dame With pimply face aflame; The kitten-playful virgin Of a half-a-hundred years; The solemn-staring sturgeon Of a firm of auctioneers; The widower flirtatious; The widow all too gracious; The man with a proboscis and a sepulcher beneath. One assassin picks his banjo, and another one his teeth. THE IN-COMING CLIMATE Now o' nights the ocean breeze Makes the patient flinch, For that zephyr bears a sneeze In every cubic inch. Lo! the admiring population Chorusing in sternutation A catarrhal acclamation! A LONG-FELT WANT Dimly apparent, through the gloom Of Market-street's opaque simoom, A queue of people, parti-sexed, Awaiting the command of âNext!â A sidewalk booth, a dingy sign: âTeeth dusted niceâfive cents a shine.â TO THE HAPPY HUNTING GROUNDS Wide windy reaches of high stubble field; A long gray road, bordered with dusty pines; A wagon moving in a âcloud by dayâ; Two city sportsmen with a dove between, Breast-high upon a fence and fast asleepâ A solitary dove, the only dove In twenty counties, and it sick, or else It were not there. Two guns that fire as one, With thunder simultaneous and loud; Two shattered human wrecks of blood and bone! And later, in the gloaming, comes a manâ The worthy local coroner is he, Renowned all thereabout, and popular With many a remain. All tenderly Compiling in a game-bag the remains, He glides into the gloom and fades from sight. The dove, cured of its ailment by the shock, Has flown, meantime, on pinions strong and fleet, To die of age in some far foreign land. SLANDER FITCH: âAll vices you've exhausted, friend; So all the papers say.â PICKERING âAh, what vile calumnies are penned!â 'Tis just the other way.â JAMES L. FLOOD As oft it happens in the youth of day That mists obscure the sun's imperfect ray, Who, as he's mounting to the dome's extreme, Smites and dispels them with a steeper beam, So you the vapors that begirt your birth Consumed, and manifested all your worth. But still one early vice obstructs the light And sullies all the visible and bright Display of mind and character. You write. THREE CANDIDATES FOR SENATOR To sleek your way to the goal of your hope, O plausible Mr. Perkins, You'll need ten tons of the softest soap And butter a thousand firkins. The soap you could put to a better use In washing your hands of ambition Ere the butter's used for cooking your goose To a beautiful brown condition. âThe Railroad can't run Stanford.â That is soâ The tail can't curl the pig; but then, you know, Inside the vegetable-garden's pale The pig destroys more cabbage than the tail. Gods! what a sight! Astride McClure's broad back Estee jogs round the Senatorial track, The crowd all undecided, as they pass, Whether to cheer the man or cheer the ass. They stop; the man to lower his feet is seen, And the tired beast, withdrawing from between, Mounts, as they start again, the biped's neck, And scarce the crowd can say which one's on deck. A GROWLER Judge Shafter, you're an aged man, I know, And learned too, I doubt not, in the law; And a head white with many a winter's snow (I wish, however, that your heart would thaw) Claims reverence and honor; but the jaw That's always busy with a word malign, Nagging and scolding every one in sight As harshly as a jaybird in a pine, And with as little sense of wrong and right As animates that irritable creature, Is not a very venerable feature. You damn all witnesses, all jurors too, And swear at the attorneys, I suppose (But that's a far more righteous thing to do) And what it's all about, the good Lord knows, Not you; but all the hotter, fiercer glows Your wrath for thatâas dogs the louder howl With only moonshine to incite their rage, And bears with more ferocious menace growl, Even when their food is flung into the cage. Reform, your Honor, and forbear to curse us, Lest all men, hearing you, cry: âEcce ursus!â AD MOODIUM Tut! Moody, do not try to show To gentlemen and ladies That if they have not âFaith,â they'll go Headlong to Hades. Faith is belief; and how can I Have that by being willing? This dime I cannot, though I try, Believe a shilling. Perhaps you can. If so, pray doâ Believe you own it, also. But what seems evidence to you I may not call so. Heaven knows I'd like the Faith to think This little vessel's contents Are liquid gold. I see 'tis ink For writing nonsense. Minds prone to Faith, however, may Come now and then to sorrow: They put their trust in truth to-day, In lies to-morrow. No doubt the happiness is great To think as one would wish to; But not to swallow every bait, As certain fish do. To think a snake a cord, I hope, Would bolden and delight me; But some day I might think a rope Would chase and bite me. âCurst Reason! Faith forever blest!â You're crying all the season. But who decides that Faith is best? Why, Mr. Reason. He's right or wrong; he answers you According to your folly, And says what you have taught him to, Like any polly. A SPADE [The spade that was used to turn the first sod in the construction of the Central Pacific Railroad is to be exhibited at the New Orleans Exposition. âPress Telegram.] Precursor of our woes, historic spade, What dismal records burn upon thy blade! On thee I see the maculating stains Of passengers' commingled blood and brains, In this red rust a widow's curse appears, And here an orphan tarnished thee with tears. Upon thy handle sanguinary bands Reveal the clutching of thine owner's hands When first he wielded thee with vigor brave To cut a sod and dig a people's graveâ For they who are debauched are dead and ought, In God's name, to be hid from sight and thought. Within thee, as within a magic glass, I seem to see a foul procession passâ Judges with ermine dragging in the mud And spotted here and there with guiltless blood; Gold-greedy legislators jingling bribes; Kept editors and sycophantic scribes; Liars in swarms and plunderers in tribes! They fade away before the night's advance, And fancy figures thee a devil's lance Gleaming portentous in the growing shade, While ghosts of murdered virtues shriek about thy blade! THE VAN NESSIAD From end to end, thine avenue, Van Ness, Rang with the cries of battle and distress! Brave lungs were thundering with dreadful sound And perspiration smoked along the ground! Sing, heavenly muse, to ears of mortal clay, The meaning, cause and finish of the fray. Great Porter Ashe (invoking first the gods, Who signed their favor with assenting nods That snapped off half their headsâtheir necks grown dry Since last the nectar cup went circling by) Resolved to build a stable on his lot, His neighbors fiercely swearing he should not. Said he: âI build that stable!â âNo you don't,â Said they. âI can!â âYou can't!â âI will!â âYou won't!â âBy heaven!â he swore; ânot only will I build, But purchase donkeys till the place is filled!â âNeedless expense,â they sneered in tones of iceâ âThe owner's self, if lodged there, would suffice.â For three long months the awful war they waged: With women, women, men with men, engaged, While roaring babes and shrilling poodles raged! Jove, from Olympus, where he still maintains His ancient session (with rheumatic pains Touched by his long exposure) marked the strife, Interminable but by loss of life; For malediction soon exhausts the breathâ If not, old age itself is certain death. Lo! he holds high in heaven the fatal beam; A golden pan depends from each extreme; One feels of Porter's fate the downward stress, One bears the destiny of all Van Ness. Alas, the rusted scales, their life all gone, Deliver judgment neither pro nor con: The dooms hang level and the war goes on. With a divine, contemptuous disesteem Jove dropped the pans and kicked, himself, the beam: Then, to decide the strife, with ready wit, The nickel that he did not care for it Twirled absently, remarking: âSee it spin: Head, Porter loses; tail, the others win.â The conscious nickel, charged with doom, spun round, Portentously and made a ringing sound, Then, staggering beneath its load of fate, Sank rattling, died at last and lay in state. Jove scanned the disk and then, as is his wont, Raised his considering orbs, exclaiming: âFront!â With leisurely alacrity approached The herald god, to whom his mind he broached: âIn San Francisco two belligerent Powers, Such as contended round great Ilion's towers, Fight for a stable, though in either class There's not a horse, and but a single ass. Achilles Ashe, with formidable jaw Assails a Trojan band with fierce hee-haw, Firing the night with brilliant curses. They With dark vituperation gloom the day. Fate, against which nor gods nor men compete, Decrees their victory and his defeat. With haste, good Mercury, betake thee hence And salivate him till he has no sense!â Sheer downward shot the messenger afar, Trailing a splendor like a falling star! With dimming lustre through the air he burned, Vanished, but with another sun returned. The sovereign of the gods superior smiled, Beaming benignant, fatherly and mild: âIs Destiny's decree performed, my lad?â And has he now no sense?â âAh, sire, he never had.â VALEDICTORY They tell me, Deacon Fitch, that you are out: The Bulletin being sold, you couldn't buy it. My, my! what could you, man, have been about These many years of editoring? Why, it Seems hardly credible that you have made So little, working at so good a trade. Why, bless you! there is Mike de Young, a manâ At least aâwell, it doesn't greatly matter; He's famous from the water-front to San Juan Smith street as less good than you, though fatter. He's rich! Among the things he's proved to own Are half a million dollars and Frank Stone. So rich is he that many persons swear He ought as Senator to be elected. He's rich enough to want the earth and air, Although not rich enough to be respected. You say that's nothing to the purpose. True, I meant to sing about, not him, but you. You're hardly worth it, maybe: he who scorns His opportunities of gain by mounting, And then dismounting, other person's corns Discredits journalism. There's no accounting For tastes; no doubt you think yourself as good As if in mail of black you proudly stood. I do not think you soâthe rich are best. They've leisure, they explain, for moral culture. (What fowl so meditative on the nestâ So introspective as the glutted vulture?) âOur Mikeâ is noble, I'm persuadedânay, He'll tell you so himself ten times a day. He will slip in: I can't at all prevent His reasonless and seasonless intrusion. I wish that, like Mo. Gunst, the wretch âhad went.â Come, Deacon, let us drink to his confusion. On second thoughts, I can't afford, I thinkâ No more can youâto buy befitting drink. Ah, well, in all these long, contentious years 'Tis many an ill turn we've done each other. You ne'er could altogether stay your sneers, Nor I regard you as an elder brother. You every way invited my dislike, Excepting by comparison with Mike. The cause of quarrel (now at end of war The hatchet we'll inter and marble-slab it) Was plain to either adversary, for 'Twas very simple, though sufficient: Habit. If there was aught behind I know notâthat Explains full twenty years of dog-and-cat. Now, as you leave the field, let me be frank: Excepting various errors of the noddle, Such as made talk of âcaving down the bank,â And lately a bad flow of Sandlot twaddle, And always a bat's blindness to my worth, Your record's clean and laudable from birth. Fitch, here's my hand; my heart is in it, too. (That organ's somewhat out of shape, however, From use in football.) Really, 'twould not do Our long relation sullenly to sever. Soon comes the silence. May we then be laid Where Mike's tall monument bestows its shade! A FISH COMMISSIONER Great Joseph D. Reddingâillustrious name!â Considered a fish-horn the trumpet of Fame. That goddess was angry, and what do you think? Her trumpet she filled with a gallon of ink, And all through the Press, with a devilish glee, She sputtered and spattered the name of J. D. TO A STRAY DOG Well, Towser (I'm thinking your name must be Towser) You're a decentish puppy as puppy dogs go, For you never, I'm sure, could have dined upon trowser, And you tail's unimpeachably curled just so. But, dear me! your nameâif 'tis yoursâis a âposerâ: Its meaning I cannot get anywise at, When spoken correctly perhaps it is Toser, And means one who toses. Max Muller, how's that? I ne'er was ingenious at all at divining A word's prehistorical, primitive state, Or finding its root, like a mole, by consigning Its bloom to the turnip-top's sorrowful fate. And, now that I think of it well, I'm no nearer The riddle's solution than everâfor how's My pretty invented word, âtose,â any clearer In point of its signification than âtowseâ? So, Towser (or Toser), I mean to rename you In honor of some good and eminent man, In the light and the heat of whose quickening fame you May grow to an eminent dog if you can. In sunshine like his you'll not long be a croucher: The Senate shall hear youâfor that I will vouch. Come here, sir. Stand up. I rechristen you Goucher. But damn you! I'll shoot you if ever you Gouch! IN HIS HAND De Young (in Chicago the story is told) âTook his life in his hand,â like a warrior bold, And stood before Buckleyâwho thought him behind, For Buckley, the man-eating monster is blind. âCount fairly the ballots!â so rang the demand Of the gallant De Young, with his life in his hand. 'Tis done, and the struggle is ended. No more He havocs the battle-field, gilt with the gore Of slain reputations. No more he defies His âlying opponentsâ with deadlier lies. His trumpet is hushed and his belt is unboundâ His enemies' characters cumber the ground. They bloat on the war-plain with ink all asoak, The fortunate candidates perching to croak. No more he will charge, with a daring divine, His foes with corruption, his friends by the line. The thunders are stilled of the horrid campaign, De Young is triumphant, and never again Will he need, with his life in his hand, to roar: âCount fair or, by God, I will die on your floor!â His life has been spared, for his sins to atone, And the hand that he took it in washed with cologne. A DEMAGOGUE âYawp, yawp, yawp! Under the moon and sun. It's aye the rabble, And I to gabble, And hey! for the tale that is never done. âChant, chant, chant! To woo the reluctant vote. I would I were dead And my say were said And my song were sung to its ultimate note. âStab, stab, stab! Ah! the weapon between my teethâ I'm sick of the flash of it; See how the slash of it Misses the foeman to mangle the sheath! âBoom, boom, boom! I'm beating the mammoth drum. My nethermost tripes I blow into the pipesâ It's O for the honors that never come!â 'Twas the dolorous blab Of a tramping âscabââ 'Twas the eloquent Swift Of the marvelous giftâ The wild, weird, wonderful gift of gab! IGNIS FATUUS Weep, weep, each loyal partisan, For Buckley, king of hearts; A most accomplished man; a man Of partsâof foreign parts. Long years he ruled with gentle sway, Nor grew his glory dim; And he would be with us to-day If ye were but with him. Men wondered at his going off In such a sudden way; 'Twas thought, as he had come to scoff He would remain to prey. Since he is gone we're all agreed That he is what men call A crook: his very steps, indeed, Are bentâto Montreal. So let our tears unhindered flow, Our sighs and groans have way: It matters not how much we O!â The devil is to pay. FROM TOP TO BOTTOM [Japan has 73,759 Buddhist priests, âmost of whom,â says a Christian missionary, âare grossly ignorant, and many of them lead scandalous lives.â] O Buddha, had you but foreknown The vices of your priesthood It would have made you twist and moan As any wounded beast would. You would have damned the entire lot And then turned Christian, would you not? There were no Christians, I'll allow, In your day; that would only Have brought distinction. Even now A Christian might feel lonely. All take the name, but facts are things As stubborn as the will of kings. The priests were ignorant and low When ridiculed by Lucian; The records, could we read, might show The same of times Confucian. And yet the fact I can't disguise That Deacon Rankin's good and wise. 'Tis true he is not quite a priest, Nor more than half a preacher; But he exhorts as loud at least As any living creature. And when the plate is passed about He never takes a penny out. From Buddha down to Rankin! There,â I never did intend to. This pen's a buzzard's quill, I swear, Such subjects to descend to. When from the humming-bird I've wrung A plume I'll write of Mike de Young. AN IDLER Who told Creed Haymond he was witty?âwho Had nothing better in this world to do? Could no greased pig's appeal to his embrace Kindle his ardor for the friendly chase? Did no dead dog upon a vacant lot, Bloated and bald, or curdled in a clot, Stir his compassion and inspire his arms To hide from human eyes its faded charms? If not to works of piety inclined, Then recreation might have claimed his mind. The harmless game that shows the feline greed To cinch the shorts and make the market bleed âPussy Wants a Corner.â Is better sport than victimizing Creed; And a far livelier satisfaction comes Of knowing Simon, autocrat of thumbs. âSimon Says Thumbs Up.â If neither worthy work nor play command This gentleman-of-leisure's heart and hand, Then Mammon might his idle spirit lift By hope of profit to some deed of thrift. Is there no cheese to pare, no flint to skin, No tin to mend, no glass to be put in, No housewife worthy of a morning visit, Her rags and sacks and bottles to solicit? Lo! the blind sow's precarious pursuit Of the aspiring oak's familiar fruit!â 'Twould more advantage any man to steal This easy victim's undefended meal Than tell Creed Haymond he has wit, and so Expose the state to his narcotic flow! THE DEAD KING Hawaii's King resigned his breathâ Our Legislature guffawed. The awful dignity of death Not any single rough awed. But when our Legislators die All Kings, Queens, Jacks and Aces cry. A PATTER SONG There was a cranky Governorâ His name it wasn't Waterman. For office he was hotter than The love of any lover, nor Was Boruck's threat of aiding him Effective in dissuading himâ This pig-headed, big-headed, singularly self-conceited Governor Nonwaterman. To citrus fairs, et cetera, He went about philandering, To pride of parish pandering, He knew not any betterâah, His early education had Not taught the abnegation fadâ The wool-witted, bull-witted, fabulously feeble-minded king of gabble-gandering! He conjured up, ad libitum, With postures energetical, One day (this is prophetical) His graces, to exhibit 'em. He straddled in each attitude, Four parallels of latitudeâ The slab-footed, crab-footed, galloping gregarian of presence unÃ¦sthetical! An ancient cow, perceiving that His powers of agility Transcended her ability (A circumstance for grieving at) Upon her horns engrafted him And to the welkin wafted himâ The high-rolling, sky-rolling, hurtling hallelujah lad of peerless volatility! A CALLER âGood morning; are you looking very well,â Said Death as, strolling through the County Jail, And entering a fat assassin's cell, He hung his hat and coat upon a nail. âI think that life in this secluded spot Agrees with men of your trade, does it not?â âWell, yes,â was the reply, âI can't complain: Life anywhereâprovided it is mineâ Agrees with me; but I observe with pain That still the people murmur and repine. It hurts their sense of harmony, no doubt, To see a persecuted man grow stout.â âO no, 'tis not your growing stout,â said Death, âWhich makes these malcontents complain and scold; They like you to be, somehow, scant of breath. What they object to is your growing old. Andâthough indifferent to lean or fatâ I don't myself entirely favor that.â With brows that met above the orbs beneath, And nose that like a soaring hawk appeared, And lifted lip, uncovering his teeth, The pampered butcher glacially sneered: âO, so you don't! Well, how will you assuage Your spongy passion for the blood of age?â Death with a clattering convulsion drew His coat on, hatted his unmeated pow, Unbarred the door and, stepping partly through, Turned and made answer: âI will show you how. I'm going to the Bench you call Supreme And tap the old women who sit there and dream.â THE SHAFTER SHAFTED Well, James McMillan Shafter, you're a Judgeâ At least you were when last I knew of you; And if the people since have made you budge I did not notice it. I've much to do Without endeavoring to follow, through The miserable squabbles, dust and smudge, The fate of all political contenders Who fight with flying colors and suspenders. Being a Judge, 'tis natural and wrong That you should villify the public pressâ Save while you are a candidate. That song Is easy quite to sing, and I confess It wins applause from hearers who have less Of spiritual graces than belong To audiences of another kidneyâ Men, for example, like Sir Philip Sidney. Newspapers, so you say, don't always treat The Judges with respect. That may be so And still no harm done, for I swear I'll eat My legs and in the long hereafter go, Snake-like, upon my belly if you'll show All Judges are respectable and sweet. For some of them are rogues and the Lord's laughter's Directed at some others, for they're Shafters. TO ONE OUT OF FAVOR Attention, Miles! You have observed, no doubt, That General Sam Young is âfired outâ; That is to say, retired for age. Just so; You were yourself retired not long agoâ Just âcast as rubbish to the voidâ (for such Is Law's demand)âalighting where 'tis much Too cold for comfort. There you may be found Piled up on Fame's eternal dumping-ground. If you've a memory you still can tell Yourself how singularly hard you fell, And no one âkissed the place to make it well.â I know not (Mr. Root knows little else) Why Sam should fare so better far than Nelse, But so he did, for scarcely did he light Ere Mr. Secretary gripped him tight, Stood him erect, removed his coat and shirt, And, finding on his person where it hurt, Performed, in pity for his hapless plight, The appropriate consolatory rite. Miles, you are lucky! True, you're badly bruised, The wound administered, the balm refused; But if too rashly you had dared to strip Your aching back for the official lip, Consider the temptation (none can fight it Who has Administration teeth) to bite it! PRIVATION With her grief the widow was so engrossed As she rode at the hearse's rear, That I really think the dead man's ghost Must have shed the ghost of a tear. She murmured and moaned and wiped her eyes And blew her pale nose for relief, Then started and cried, as in pained surprise, âI've forgotten my handkerchief! âO, what shall I do when we get to the grave And the coffin is put in the ground? I know I shall weep, for I cannot be brave With those staring people all round.â âBe calm,â said one; âthere is nothing forgot, For your handkerchief you bringâ You are holding itâsee.â Said the widow: âWhat! This pokey old linen thing?â TO ONE IN CUSTODY Villain! for years you've plied your awful trade For wife, for widow andâno, not for maid: Even you'll confess in chastity one true Advantageâits immunity from you. About your hand, in clamorous appeal, As round the blade of Calmar, shriek and wheel, Like flights of Arctic seabirds, the forlorn Pale ghostsâmothers and babes unborn. Now, villain, now, I pray your time has comeâ Mercy be deaf and intercession dumb! No more, red-handed, in the path to life May you be found alurk with eager knife, Nor longer o'er the door to death display The sign, âFor Ladies.â Lo! day after day For twenty years I've read on every wall A handwriting prophetic of your fall. And now the last dread syllable I spell That damns your body to a felon's cellâ Your soul has long awaited you in Hell! FOR A REVISED VERSION Oh, deem it not presumption, Lord, In me to revise Thy holy Wordâ No jot or tittle I'd efface, No menace dire, nor pledge of grace. No poetry I'd blot (although it's Well known to Thee that I hate poets), But humbly, reverently try Some missing mandates to supply. For lo! I fall of dunces ill, Who've got by heart Thy written will; I turn, behold! in tears away From rogues Thy bidding who obey. Wherever âThou shalt notâ occurs I'd add âThou shalt the exact reverse,â And many a virtue, too, compel (By plain command and threat of hell) Which has no corresponding vice To interdict in terms precise. Thus I'd exterminate the brood Of rascals negatively goodâ Men Bible-clear, who ought to smart Beneath the lash at tail of cart. Each soul (masks, too, would then be thinner) If not a saint, should be a sinner. In error, Lord, if I am found, Observe how clouds my vision bound: Forgive my narrowness of sight, And bless me with the larger light In Thine imperfect law to trace The perfect purpose of Thy grace. THE MORMON QUESTION By J-qu-n M-ll-r I said I will shake myself out of my clothes, I will roll up my sleeves, I will spit on my hands (The hands that I kissed to the sun in the lands To the north, to the east, to the south, and the west Of every sea that is under the sun), I will go to the land that the Gentile loathes As he gathers his one small wife to his breast And curses and loathes till his life is done. I will go to the place of the Mormon: the place Where the jackass rabbit is first in the race And the woodchuck chatters in meaningless gleeâ Chatters and twists all his marvelous faceâ Twists it and chatters and looks like me. And I rose in the strongest strength of my strength, With my breast of brass and my hair's full length, And I shook myself out of my clothes in the land Of the Mormons, and stood there and kissed my hand. AN ELECTION EXPENSE Stanford, when recently you gave Tom Fitch Ten thousand dollars, gold, to âstump the Stateâ (A circumstance of no importance, which You deemed it right, however, to relate To the grand jury) did you calculate That it and other sums, which I will not Embarrass you by naming, would come back, As bread upon the waters, piping hot, With added pancakes in an ample stack? 'Twere better, sir, to cast your bread-and-butter (You'd get that back, at least) into the gutter. Tom Fitch's âsilver tongueâ is very well If let aloneâthough that he'll never do. For he must live by what he has to sell, And silver should be âfree,â that's very true. But how the devil could the thing help you? Like an unruly child, it kicks and squalls In mutiny whene'er he moves his chin, And ne'er is faithful except when he falls Asleep in JeâI mean, of course, in Gin. Tom's tongue make Senators? No, no, that's gammon; They're made by Mr. Stow and Mr. Mammon. I know they are, for once I saw the two Hobnobbing in a friendly kind of way Up there at Sacramento. It is true You were not with them. I heard statesmen say You took good care to tarry at the Bay, Where you could be âsurprisedâ when Creed should claim Your ear, and hope you'd pardon him, and sigh, And say he'd ventured to propose your name, And that all men had thrown their hats so high That none had yet come down, and split their collars With cheers, andâwould you loan him twenty dollars? A famous person said that God and he Were a majority; so, by your leave, Are you and Mammon; but it seems to me That you and he on this Thanksgiving eve Should drink a stirrup-cup (for I perceive You ride your philanthropic hobbyâNed Curtis astride behind you) and so part. For, after all is done and all is said, Mammon &amp; Stanford are not over-smart. The firm's an old one, but not quite respected Since you in statesmanship have been detected. WILLIAM F. SMITH Light lie the earth upon his dear dead heart, And dreams disturb him never. Be deeper peace than Paradise his part Forever and forever. JUVENTUS MUNDI Dr. Allen Griffiths is an audible Theosopherâ A student of Blavatsky, inconsolable for loss of her. He says (he's seen the figures, too) the human race was flourishing Three hundred million years upon this planet, ever nourishing The flame of immortality (which always, though, was flickering Until it burned, a still, eternal red, in Mr. Pickering) Before that microbe-chief of all the spiritual faculties, The Faculty of Thinking, heard of Man and lightly tackled his Poor brain, then sleeping sweetly in his undefended cranium, Unable to distinguish a surmise from a geranium. O happy, happy period of mental independency! O golden, golden age of Theosophical ascendency! TWO GUIDES [Ingersoll has neither philosophy nor logic. He has only sentiment, wit and rhetoric. âBulletin.] You, Fitch, are known to be a Deaconâ A shining light, a holy beacon Upon the walls of Zion, blazing With an effulgency amazing. And yet, I think, between the two (Bob Ingersoll, I mean, and you) A man in want of light to read Between the lines of nature's Creed Would rather scrutinize Creation By Robert's clear illumination, Than blind his eyes with smoke and vapor From your infernal sputtering taper. Though Ingersoll, perchance, had not Of wisdom or of truth one jot, I'd rather miss with him the clew To life than follow it with you. IN WARNING They tell us, dear Kipling, you're coming to shoot In the hills of the wide, wild West. There's a lot of cost and a risk to bootâ I don't at all think it is best, And hope it is only a jest. For, Rudyard, although you're a terrible swell You're not in high favor out here; For you said San Francisco was meaner thanâwell, You said it was very small beer And Chicago uncommonly queer. You put your legs under our tables, you did, You dined at the Jollidog Club; And when of your hunger you well were rid (And you manners too) like a cub You snarled at the speeches and grub. You saidâI don't know the one half that you said, But I know you pretended to meet Some folk that existed not out of your head Or an English comical sheet. And you vilified Kearny street! Our statesman apparently didn't get far In the favor of one so too, Too utterly fine. Nor the plump cigar Nor the shiny hat could woo The sweet and beautiful You. But hardest of all our hearts you wrung With assorted pangs and woes When you said you could speak the English tongue, But not the American nose. And you damned our orators o's! For all of this and for all of that You'd better abate your flame, And remain where pheasants are tame and fat And the sportsman takes his aim, As a general thing, at the game. Out here when we go to shoot, perhaps Nor beast nor bird we see; So we just let go at the Britisher chaps Who have made remarks too free, And the same surcease to be. APPARITION âThe ghosts are all gone,â the Bulletin cries. O neighbor, good neighbor, where are your eyes? Gruesome and ghastly, beneath your nose A ghost is stalking that never goes. With a stony eye and a brow of gloom, It enters the editorial room, It haunts the passages, haunts the stairsâ Editors, printers alike it scares; But the reader most it appals, for still It writes and writes with a real quill, On real paper, in real ink, The phantoms of thoughts that dead men think. Sheeted ideas from wormy brains Troop o'er the paper, and spooks of strains Of sepulchral laughter seem to float In the air as the ghost reads what it wrote; And a faint, white, phosphorescent rayâ The visible eloquence of decayâ Gleams on its lips as it reads each word In a tone that no mortal before has heard. Copy to printer and ghost to tombâ Silent the editorial room. O the Bulletin ghost is indeed a most Remarkable kind of a Bulletin ghost. Who sees it cries, as his heart were bled: âO God! will Bill Bartlett never stay dead?â A CREDITABLE COLLISION There was once a brave collision In Imaginary Bay, When a steamer with precision Clove its comfortable way Through another, which had hospitably stood To receive it, as a civil steamer should. Then the people on the latter Said they didn't understand, But they thought they'd better scatter To the most adjacent land; And the people on the former said: âThat's soâ You will find it sixty fathoms down below.â Then the skipper of the vessel Which was sinking in the brine Said to t'other one: âI guess I'll Trouble you to drop a line.â âWell, just give me your address,â was the reply, âI am busy but I'll write you by-and-by.â Then the carpenter whose function Was to mend the leaky boat Said: âSo wide is our disjunction That we cannot longer float. See the rats already leave us!â And so he Up and hove his kit among them in the sea. Though these incidents are cheerful For a landsman to relate, Yet the passengers were fearful Of a melancholy fate; For their knowledge was imperfect of the way That the fishes have of breathing in the bay. Some of them, who were accounted Quite unmannerly and rude, On the floating steamer mounted, Saying: âHope we don't intrude.â But the others, with politeness rare and fine, Said their tickets were not good upon that line. But the skipper of the wetter Ship, the pilot and the mateâ Nothing ever yet was better Than the way they met their fate; For the perils that beset them in their climb They encountered with alacrity sublime. When the troubles all were ended And the living safe in port Invitation was extended For them all to come to court. Where the officers (they afterward explained) Were with deferential kindness entertained. Twenty Consuls, ten Inspectors, Thirty Coroners were there, Eighty-seven skilled objectors And a Notary to swear; And before that court the sailor-people sighed And expounded how the passengers had lied. The unanimous decision Of that high and mighty court Was âspontaneous collisionââ (I am quoting the report) And the skippers were commended who had fed To the lobsters each a bellyful of dead. AN EMIGRANT (AFTER TENNYSON) You ask me why, though ill at ease, Within this region I subsist, Where all defaulters fill the fist Ere sailing o'er the western seas. It is a land where one may kill With sober-sided freedomâbruise And shoot and stab whome'er he choose, And thugs may wreak their own sweet will. A land of such misgovernment That Justice here has not a frown, And greed still broadens slowly down, From Scavenger to President; Where Faction gathers to a head, And in his greasy, foulest thought Sets law and order all at naughtâ Goes in for anarchy instead. If banded unions prosecute Our unions like the deuce, and I'm About to be had up for crime, Or made to keep my clapper mute; And Power should take from purse and till, The gains that I appropriate From every coffer of the State, And I to fight have not the will, Then waft me from the harbor south, Wild winds! I seek a safer sky, Where I can plunder still, and I Can still shoot off my loaded mouth. CONTEMPT OF COURT So, Juror Simpson, you got drunk And was a holy show! Who could have thought that you had sunk So very low As not to hold it clearly sinful To get your miserable skin full? Defendant has a right, I think, To trial by her peers; Are you one when you are in drink Up to your ears? You're not her equal by a pailful When you've enough to make a whale full. Judge Ross, who never, never looks On wine when it is red, But sits cold sober cramming books Into his head, Poor fellow! must have felt quite rueful, Observing, not himself, but you full. Ah, well, I know you did not meanâ 'Twas all an accident: You drank between drinks, and between Them you repent. But just prepare for something awful In words: That jurist has his jaw full. A PARTIAL ECLIPSE A Person of Consequence rose from the dead, And to him a curious citizen said: âBeg pardon, but why is your glorious name Not blazoned in gold on the Temple of Fame?â âI truly don't know,â said the spook in reply, âAnd was just on the point of asking you why Those other names are.â And the risen one made A wink that threw half of the land into shade, Sent half of the hens to their perches aloof, And half of the cats to the peak of a roof, Half-crazed the foreseer of eclipses, and fooled The funny left lobe of the brain of Miss Gould. THE MUMMERY THE TWO CAVEES DRAMATIS PERSONÃ Fitch a Pelter of Railrogues Pickering his Partner, an Enemy to Sin Old Nick a General Blackwasher Dead Cat a Missile Antique Egg Another Railrogues, Dump-Carters, Navvies and Unassorted Shovelry in the Lower Distance. SceneâThe Brink of a Railway Cut, a Mile Deep. Timeâ1875. Fitch: Gods! what a steep declivity! Below I see the lazy dump-carts come and go, Creeping like beetles and about as big. The delving Paddiesâ Pickering: Case of infra dig. Fitch: Loring, light-minded and unmeaning quips Come with but scant propriety from lips Fringed with the blue-black evidence of age. 'Twere well to cultivate a style more sage, For men will fancy, hearing how you pun, Our foulest missiles are but thrown in fun. (Enter Dead Cat) Here's one that thoughtfully has come to hand; Slant your fine eye below and see it land. (Seizes Dead Cat by the tail and swings it in act to throw.) Dead Cat (singing): Merrily, merrily, round I goâ Over and under and at. Swing wide and free, swing high and low The anti-monopoly cat! O, who wouldn't be in the place of me, The anti-monopoly cat? Designed to admonish, Persuade and astonish The capitalist andâ Fitch (letting go): Scat! (Exit Dead Cat.) Pickering Huzza! good Deacon, well and truly flung! Pat Stanford it has grassed, and Mike de Young. Mike drives a dump-cart for the villains, though 'Twere fitter that he pull it. Well, we owe The traitor one for leaving us!âsome day We'll get, if not his place, his cart away. Meantime fling missilesâany kind will do. (Enter Antique Egg.) Ha! we can give them an ovation, too! Antique Egg: In the valley of the Nile, Where the Holy Crocodile Of immeasurable smile Blossoms like the early rose, And the Sacred Onion growsâ When the Pyramids were new And the Sphinx possessed a nose, By a storkess I was laid In the cool papyrus shade, Where the rushes later grew, That concealed the little Jew, Baby Mose. Straining very hard to hatch, I disrupted there my yolk; And I felt my yellow streaming Through my white; And the dream that I was dreaming Of posterity was broke In a night. Then from the papyrus-patch By the rising waters rolled, Passing many a temple old, I proceeded to the sea. Memnon sang, one morn, to me, And I heard Cambyses sass The tomb of Ozymandias! Fitch: O, venerablest orb of all the earth, God rest the lady fowl that gave thee birth! Fit missile for the vilest hand to throwâ I freely tender thee mine own. Although As a bad egg I am myself no slouch, Thy riper years thy ranker worth avouch. Now, Pickering, please expose your eye and say Ifâwhoop!â (exit Egg.) I've got the range. Pickering: Horray! hooray! A grand good shot, and Teddy Colton's down: It burst in thunderbolts upon his crown! Larry O'Crocker drops his pick and flies, And deafening odors scream along the skies! Pelt 'em some more. Fitch: There's nothing left but tarâ I wish I were a Yahoo. Pickering: Well, you are. But keep the tar. How well I recollect, When Mike was in with usâproud, strong, erectâ Mens conscia rectiâflinging mud, he stood, Austerely brave, incomparably good, Ere yet for filthy lucre he began To drive a cart as Stanford's hired man, That pitch-pot bearing in his hand, Old Nick Appeared and tarred us all with the same stick. (Enter Old Nick.) I hope he won't return and use his arts To make us part with our immortal parts. Old Nick: Make yourself easy on that score my lamb; For both your souls I wouldn't give a damn! I want my tar-potâhello! where's the stick? Fitch: Don't look at me that fashion!âlook at Pick. Pickering: Forgive me, fatherâpity my remorse! Truth isâMike took that stick to spank his horse. It fills my pericardium with grief That I kept company with such a thief. (Endeavoring to get his handkerchief, he opens his coat and the tar-stick falls out. Nick picks it up, looks at the culprit reproachfully and withdraws in tears.) Fitch (excitedly): O Pickering, come hither to the brinkâ There's something going on down there, I think! With many an upward smile and meaning wink The navvies all are running from the cut Like lunatics, to right and leftâ Pickering: Tut, tutâ 'Tis only some poor sport or boisterous joke. Let us sit down and have a quiet smoke. (They sit and light cigars.) Fitch (singing): When first I met Miss Toughie I smoked a fine cigyar, An' I was on de dummy And she was in de cyar. Both (singing): An' I was on de dummy An' she was in de cyar. Fitch (singing): I couldn't go to her, An' she wouldn't come to me; An' I was as oneasy As a gander on a tree. Both (singing): An' I was as oneasy As a gander on a tree. Fitch (singing): But purty soon I weakened An' lef' de dummy's bench, An' frew away a ten-cent weed To win a five-cent wench! Both (singing): An' frew away a ten-cent weed To win a five-cent wench! Fitch: Is there not now a certain substance sold Under the name of fulminate of gold, A high explosive, popular for blasting, Producing an effect immense and lasting? Pickering: Nay, that's mere superstition. Rocks are rent And excavations made by argument. Explosives all have had their day and season; The modern engineer relies on reason. He'll talk a tunnel through a mountain's flank And by fair speech cave down the tallest bank. (The earth trembles, a deep subterranean explosion is heard and a section of the bank as big as El Capitan starts away and plunges thunderously into the cut. A part of it strikes De Young's dump-cart abaft the axletree and flings him, hurtling, skyward, a thing of legs and arms, to descend on the distant mountains, where it is cold. Fitch and Pickering pull themselves out of the dÃ©bris and stand ungraveling their eyes and noses.) Fitch: Well, since I'm down here I will help to grade, And do dirt-throwing henceforth with a spade. Pickering: God bless my soul! it gave me quite a start. Well, fate is fateâI guess I'll drive this cart. (Curtain) METEMPSYCHOSIS DRAMATIS PERSONÃ St. John a Presidential Candidate McDonald a Defeated Aspirant Mrs. Hayes a Former President Pitts-Stevens a Water Nymph SceneâA Small Lake in the Alleghany Mountains. St. John (solus): Hours I've immersed my muzzle in this tarn And, quaffing copious potations, tried To suck it dry; but ever as I pumped Its waters into my distended skin The labor of my zeal extruded them In perspiration from my pores; and so, Rilling the marginal declivity, They fell again into their source. Ah, me! Could I but find within these ancient hills Some long extinct volcano, by the rains Of countless ages in its crater brimmed Like a full goblet, I would lay me down Prone on the outer slope, and o'er its edge Arching my neck, I'd siphon out its store And flood the valleys with my sweet for aye. So should I be accounted as a god, Even as Father Nilus is. What's that? Methought I heard some sawyer draw his file With jarring, stridulous cacophany Across his notchy blade, to set its teeth And mine on edge. Ha! there it goes again! Song, within: Cold water's the milk of the mountains, And Nature's our wet-nurse. O then, Glue thou thy blue lips to her fountains Forever and ever, amen! St. John: Why surely there's congenial company Aloofâthe spirit, I suppose, that guards This sacred spot; perchance some water-nymph Who laving in the crystal flood her limbs Has taken cold, and so, with raucous voice Afflicts the sensitive membrane of mine ear The while she sings my sentiments. (Enter Pitts-Stevens.) Hello! What fiend is this? Pitts-Stevens: 'Tis I, be not afraid. St. John: And who, thou antiquated crone, art thou? I ne'er forget a face, but names I can't So well remember. I have seen thee oft. When in the middle season of the night, Curved with a cucumber, or knotted hard With an eclectic pie, I've striven to keep My head and heels asunder, thou hast come, With sociable familiarity, Into my dream, but not, alas, to bless. Pitts-Stevens: My name's Pitts-Stevens, age just seventeen years; Talking teetotaler, professional Beauty. St. John: What dost thou here? Pitts-Stevens: I'm come, fair sir, With paints and brush to blazon on these rocks The merits of my master's nostrumâso: (paints rapidly: ââMcDonald's Vinegar Bitters!â) St. John: What are they? Pitts-Stevens: A woman suffering from widowhood Took a full bottle and was cured. A man There wasâa murderer; the doctors all Had given him upâhe'd but an hour to live. He swallowed half a glassful. He is dead, But not of Vinegar Bitters. A wee babe Lay sick and cried for it. The mother gave That innocent a spoonful and it smoothed Its pathway to the tomb. 'Tis warranted To cause a boy to strike his father, make A pig squeal, start the hair upon a stone, Or play the fiddle for a country dance. (Enter McDonald, reading a Sunday-school book.) Good morrow, sir; I trust you're well. McDonald: H'lo, Pitts! Observe, good friends, I have a volume here Myself am author ofâa noble book To train the infant mind (delightful task!) It tells how one Samantha Brown, age six, A gutter-bunking slave to rum, was saved By Vinegar Bitters, went to church and now Has an account at my Pacific Bank. I'll read the whole work to you. St. John: Heaven forbid! I've elsewhere an engagement. Pitts-Stevens: I am deaf. McDonald (reading regardless): âOnce on a time there livedââ (enter Mrs. Hayes, as a tree walking) Behold our queen! All: Her eyes upon the ground Before her feet she low'rs, Walking, in thought profound, As 'twere, upon all fours. Her visage is austere, Her gait a high parade; At every step you hear The plashing lemonade! Mrs. Hayes (to herself): Once, sitting in the White House, hard at work Signing state papers (Rutherford was there, Knitting some hose) a sudden glory fell Upon my paper. I looked up and saw An angel, holding in his hand a rod Wherewith he struck me. Smarting with the blow I rose and (cuffing Rutherford) inquired: âWherefore this chastisement?â The angel said: âFour years you have been President, and still There's rum!ââthen flew to Heaven. Contrite, I swore Such oath as lady Methodist might take, My second term should medicine my first. The people would not have it that way; so I seek some candidate who'll take my soulâ My spirit of reform, fresh from my breast, Giving me his instead; and thus equipped With my imperious and fiery essence, Drive the Drink-Demon from the land and fill The people up with water till their teeth Are all afloat. (St. John discovers himself.) What, you? St. John: Aye, Madam, I'll Swap souls with you and lead the cold sea-green Amphibians of Prohibition on, Pallid of nose and webbed of foot, swim-bladdered, Gifted with gillsâinvincible! Mrs. Hayes: Enough, Stand forth and consummate the interchange. (While McDonald and Pitts-Stevens modestly turn their backs, the latter blushing a delicate shrimp-pink, St. John and Mrs. Hayes effect an exchange of immortal parts. When the transfer is complete McDonald turns and advances, uncorking a bottle of Vinegar Bitters.) McDonald (chanting): Nectar compounded of simples Cocted in Stygian shadesâ Acids of wrinkles and pimples From faces of ancient maidsâ Acrid precipitates sunken From tempers of scolding wives Whose husbands, sagaciously drunken, Rejoice in oblivious lives,â With this I baptize and appoint thee (to St. John) To marshal the vinophobe ranks. In Neptune's name I anoint thee (pours the liquid down St. John's back) As King of aquatical cranks! (The liquid blisters the royal back, and His Majesty starts on a dead run, energetically exclamatory. Exit St. John.) Mrs. Hayes: My soul! My soul! I'll never get it back Unless I follow nimbly on his track. (Exit Mrs. Hayes.) Pitts-Stevens: O my! he's such a beautiful young man! I'll follow, too, and wed him if I can. (Exit Pitts-Stevens.) McDonald (solus): He scarce is visible, his dust so great! Methinks for so obscure a candidate He runs quite well. But as for Prohibitionâ I mean myself to hold the first position. (Produces a pocket flask, topes a cruel quantity of double-distilled thunder-and-lightning out of it, smiles so grimly as to darken all the stage and sings): Though fortunes vary, let all be merry, And then if e'er a disaster befall, At Styx's ferry is Charon's wherry In easy call. Upon a ripple of golden tipple That tipsy ship'll convey you best. To king and cripple, the bottle's the nipple Of Nature's breast! (Curtain) SLICKENS DRAMATIS PERSONÃ Hayseed a Granger Nozzle a Miner Ringdivvy a Statesman Feegobble a Lawyer Junket a Committee SceneâYuba Dam. Feegobble, Ringdivvy, Nozzle Nozzle: My friends, since '51 I have pursued The evil tenor of my watery way, Removing hills as by an act of faithâ Ringdivvy: Just so; the steadfast faith of those who hold, In foreign lands beyond the Eastern sea, The shares in your concernâa simple, blind, Unreasoning belief in dividends, Still stimulated by assessments which, When the stars fall, upon the backs of toads, Will bring, no doubt, a very great return. All (singing): O the adequate assessment, The annual assessment, The regular assessment, That makes the water flow. Ringdivvy: The rascally assessment! Feegobble: The murderous assessment! Nozzle: The glorious assessment That makes my mare to go! Feegobble: But, Nozzle, you, I think, were on the point Of making a remark about some rightsâ Some certain vested rights you have acquired By long immunity; for still the law Holds that if one do evil undisturbed His right to do so ripens with the years; And one may be a villain long enough To make himself an honest gentleman. All (singing): Hail, holy law, The soul with awe Bows to thy dispensation. Nozzle: It breaks my jaw! Ringdivvy: It qualms my maw! Feegobble: It feeds my jaw, It crams my maw, It is my soul's salvation! Nozzle: Why, yes, I've floated mountains to the sea For lo! these many years; though some, they say, Do strand themselves along the bottom lands And cover up a village here and there, And here and there a ranch. 'Tis said, indeed, The granger with his female and his young Does not infrequently go to the dickens By premature burial in slickens. All (singing): Could slickens forever Choke up the river, And slime's endeavor Be tried on grain, How small the measure Of granger's treasure, How keen his pain! Ringdivvy: These rascal grangers would long since have been Submerged in slimes, to the last man of them, But for the fact that all their wicked tribes Affect our legislation with their bribes. All (singing): O bribery's greatâ 'Tis a pillar of State, And the people they are free! Feegobble: It smashes my slate! Nozzle: It is thievery straight! Ringdivvy: But it's been the making of me! Nozzle: I judge by certain shrewd sensations here In these callosities I call my thumbsâ A thrilling sense as of ten thousand pins, Red-hot and penetrant, transpiercing all The cuticle and tickling through the nervesâ That some malign and awful thing draws near. (Enter Hayseed.) Good Lord! here are the ghosts and spooks of all The grangers I have decently interred, Rolled into one! Feegobble: Plead, phantom. Ringdivvy: You've the floor. Hayseed: From the margin of the river (Bitter Creek, they sometimes call it) Where I cherished once the pumpkin, And the summer squash promoted, Harvested the sweet potato, Dallied with the fatal melon And subdued the fierce cucumber, I've been driven by the slickens, Driven by the slimes and tailings! All my familyâmy Polly Ann and all my sons and daughters, Dog and baby both includedâ All were swamped in seas of slickens, Buried fifty fathoms under, Where they lie, prepared to play their Gentle prank on geologic Gents that shall exhume them later, In the dim and distant future, Taking them for melancholy Relics antedating Adam. I alone got up and dusted. Nozzle: Avaunt! you horrid and infernal shape! What dire distress have you prepared for us? Ringdivvy: Were I a buzzard stooping from the sky My craw with filth to fill, Into your honorable body I Would introduce a bill. Feegobble: Defendant, hence, or, by the gods, I'll brain thee!â Unless you saved some turnips to retain me. Hayseed: As I was saying, I got up and dusted, My ranch a graveyard and my business busted! But hearing that a fellow from the City, Who calls himself a Citizens' Committee, Was coming up to play the very dickens, With those who cover up our farms with slickens, And make himselfâunless I am in errorâ To all such miscreants a holy terror, I thought if I would join the dialogue I maybe might get payment for my dog. All (singing): O the dog is the head of Creation, Prime work of the Master's hand; He hasn't a known occupation, Yet lives on the fat of the land. Adipose, indolent, sleek and orbicular, Sun-soaken, door-matted, cross and particular. Men, women, children, all coddle and wait on him, Then, accidentally shutting the gate on him, Miss from their calves, ever after, the rifted out Mouthful of tendons that doggy has lifted out! (Enter Junket.) Junket: Well met, my hearties! I must trouble you Jointly and severally to provide A comfortable carriage, with relays Of hardy horses. This Committee means To move in state about the country here. I shall expect at every place I stop Good beds, of course, and everything that's nice, With bountiful repast of meat and wine. For this Committee comes to see and mark And inwardly digest. Hayseed: Digest my dog! Nozzle: First square my claim for damages: the gold Escaping with the slickens keeps me poor! Ringdivvy: I merely would remark that if you'd grease My itching palm it would more glibly glide Into the public pocket. Feegobble: Sir, the wheels Of justice move but slowly till they're oiled. I have some certain writs and warrants here, Prepared against your advent. You recall The tale of Zaccheus who did climb a tree, And Jesus said: âCome downâ? Junket: Why, bless your souls! I've got no money; I but came to see What all this noisy babble is about, Make a report and file the same away. Nozzle, Dingdivvy, Feegobble, Hayseed: How'll that help us? Reports are not our style Of provender! Junket: Well, you can gnaw the file.

(Curtain) ASPIRANTS THREE DRAMATIS PERSONÃ QUICK: De Young a Brother to Mushrooms DEAD: Swift an Heirloom Estee a Relic IMMORTALS. The Spirit of Broken Hopes. The Author. MISCELLANEOUS. A Troupe of Coffins. The Moon. Various Colored Fires. SceneâThe Political Graveyard at Bone Mountain. De Young (solus): This is the spot agreed upon. Here rest The sainted statesmen who upon the field Of honor have at divers times laid down Their own, and ended, ignominious, Their lives political. About me, lo! Their silent headstones, gilded by the moon, Half-full and near her settingâmidnight. Hark! Through the white mists of this portentous night (Which throng in moving shapes about my way, As they were ghosts of candidates I've slain, To fray their murderer) my open ear Engulfs a footstep. (Enter Estee from his tomb.) Ah, 'tis he, my foe, True to appointment; and so here we fightâ Though truly 'twas my firm belief that he Would send regrets, or I had not been here. Estee: O moon that hast so oft surprised the deeds Whereby I rose to greatness!âtricksy orb, The type and symbol of my politics, Now draw my ebbing fortunes to their flood, As, by the magic of a poultice, boils That burn ambitions with defeated fires Are lifted into eminence. (Sees De Young.) What? you! Faith, if I had suspected you would come From the fair world of politics wherein So lately you were whelped, and which, alas, I vainly to revisit strive, though still Rapped on the rotting head and bidden sleep Till Resurrection's morn,âif I had thought You would accept the challenge that I flung I would have seen you damned ere I came forth In the night air, shroud-clad and shivering, To fight so mean a thing. But since you're here, Draw and defend yourself. By gad, we'll see Who'll be Postmaster-General! De Young: We willâ I'll fight (for I am lame) with any blue And redolent remain that dares aspire To wreck the Grand Old Grandson's cabinet. Here's at you, nosegay! (They draw tongues and are about to fight, when from an adjacent whited sepulcher, enter Swift.) Swift: Hold! put up your tongues! Within the confines of this sacred spot Broods such a holy calm as none may break By clash of weapons, without sacrilege. (Beats down their tongues with a bone.) Madmen! what profits it? For though you fought With such heroic skill that both survived, Yet neither should achieve the prize, for I Would wrest it from him. Let us not contend, But friendliwise by stipulation fix A slate for mutual advantage. Why, Having the pick and choice of seats, should we Forego them all but one? Nay, we'll take three, And part them so among us that to each Shall fall the fittest to his powers. In brief, Let us establish a Portfolio Trust. Estees: Agreed. De Young: Aye, truly, 'tis a greedâand one The offices imperfectly will sate, But I'll stand in. Swift. Well, so 'tis understood, As you're the junior member of the Trust, Politically younger and undead, Speak, Michael: what portfolio do you chose? De Young: I've thought the Postal service best would serve My interest; but since I have my pick, I'll take the War Department. It is known Throughout the world, from Market street to Pine, (For a Chicago journal told the tale) How in this hand I lately took my life And marched against great Buckley, thundering My mandate that he count the ballots fair! Earth heard and shrank to half her size! Yon moon, Which rivaled then a liver's whiteness, paused That night at Butchertown and daubed her face With sheep's blood! Then my serried rank I drew Back to my stronghold without loss. To mark My care in saving human lifeâmy ownâ The Peace Society bestowed on me Its leather medal and the title, too, Of Colonel. Yes, my genius is for war. Good land! I naturally dote on a brass band! (Sings.) O, give me a life on the tented field, Where the cannon roar and ring, Where the flag floats free and the foemen yield And bleed as the bullets sing. But be it not mine to wage the fray Where matters are ordered the other way, For that is a different thing. O, give me a life in the fierce campaignâ Let it be the life of my foe: I'd rather fall upon him than the plain; That service I'd fain forego. O, a warrior's life is fine and free, But a warrior's deathâah me! ah me! That's a different thing, you know. Estee: Some claim I might myself advance to that Portfolio. When Rebellion raised her head, And you, my friends, stayed meekly in your shirts, I marched with banners to the party stump, Spat on my hands, made faces fierce as death, Shook my two fists at once and introduced Brave resolutions terrible to read! Nay, only recently, as you do know, I conquered Treason by the word of mouth, And slew again (to her surprise) the South! Swift: You once fought Stanford, too. Estee: Enough of thatâ Give me the Interior and I'll devote My mind to agriculture and improve The breed of cabbages, especially The Brassica Celeritatis, named For you because in days of long ago You sold it at your market stall,âand, faith, 'Tis said you were an honest huckster then. I'll be Attorney-General if you Prefer; for know I am a lawyer too! Swift: I never have heard that!âhave you, De Young? De Young: Never, so help me! And I swear I've heard A score of Judges say that he is not. Swift (to Estee): You take the Interior. I might aspire To military station too, for once I led my party into Pixley's camp, And he paroled me. I defended, too, The State of Oregon against the sharp And bloody tooth of the Australian sheep. But I've an aptitude exceeding neat For bloodless battles of diplomacy. My cobweb treaty of Exclusion once, Through which a hundred thousand coolies sailed, Was much admired, but most by Colonel Bee. Though born a tinker, I'm a diplomat From old Missouri, and Iâha! what's this? (Exit Moon. Enter Blue Lights on all the tombs, and a circle of Red Fire on the grass; in the center the Spirit of Broken Hopes, and round about, a Troupe of Coffins, dancing and singing.) Chorus of Coffins: Two bodies dead and one aliveâ Yo, ho, merrily all! Now for office strain and striveâ Buzzards all a-warble, O! Prophets three, agape for bread; Raven with a stone insteadâ Providential raven! Judges two and Colonel oneâ Run, run, rustics, run! But it's O, the pig is shaven, And oily, oily all! (Exeunt Coffins, dancing. The Spirit of Broken Hopes advances, solemnly pointing at each of the Three Worthies in turn.) Spirit of Broken Hopes: Governor, Governor, editor man, Rusty, musty, spick-and-span, Harlequin, harridan, dicky-dout, Demagogue, charlatanâo, u, t, OUT! (De Young falls and sleeps.) Antimonopoler, diplomat, Railroad lackey, political rat, One, two, threeâSCAT! (Swift falls and sleeps.) Boycotting chin-worker, working to woo Fortune, the fickle, to smile upon you, Jo-coated acrobat, shuttle-cockâSHOO! (Estee falls and sleeps.) Now they lie in slumber sweet, Now the charm is all complete, Hasten I with flying feet To where beyond the farther sea A babe upon its mother's knee Is gazing into skies afar And crying for a golden star. I'll drag a cloud across the blue And break that infant's heart in two! (Exeunt the Spirit of Broken Hopes and the Red and Blue Fires. Re-enter Moon.) Estee (waking): Why, this is strange! I dreamed I know not what. It seemed that certain apparitions were, Which sang uncanny words, significant And yet ambiguousâhalf-understoodâ Portending evil; and an awful spook, Even as I stood with my accomplices, Counted me out, as children do in play. Is that you, Mike? De Young (waking): It was. Swift (waking): And I all that? Then I'll reform my life. (Reforms his life.) Ah! had I known How sweet it is to be an honest man I never would have stooped to turn my coat For public favor, as chameleons take The hue (as near as they can judge) of that Supporting them. Henceforth I'll buy With money all the offices I need, And know the profit of an honest life, Or stay forever in this dismal place. Now that I'm good, it will no longer do To make a third with such a wicked two. (Returns to his tomb.) De Young: Prophetic dream; by some good angel sent To make me with a quiet life content. The question shall no more my bosom irk, To go to Washington or go to work. From Fame's debasing struggle I'll withdraw, And taking up the pen lay down the law. I'll leave this rogue, lest my example make An honest man of himâhis heart would break. (Exit De Young.) Estee: Out of my company these converts flee, But that advantage is denied to me: My curst identity's confining skin Nor lets me out nor tolerates me in. But since my hopes eternally have fled, And, dead before, I'm more than ever dead, To find a grander tomb be now my task, And pack my pork into a stolen cask. (Exit, searching. Loud calls for the Author, who appears, bowing and smiling. Enter Faint Odor of Mortality. Exit the Gas.) THE BIRTH OF THE RAIL DRAMATIS PERSONÃ Leland the Kid a Road Agent Cowboy Charley Same Line of Business Happy Hunty Ditto in All Ways Sootymug a Devil SceneâThe Dutch Flat Stage Road, at 12 P. M., on a Night of 1864. Cowboy Charley: I fear the coach will not come by to-night. Already it is past the hour, and yet My ears have reached no sound of wheels; no note Melodious, of long, luxurious oaths Betokens the traditional dispute (Unsettled from the dawn of time) between The driver and off wheeler; no clear chant Nor carol of Wells Fargo's messenger Unbosoming his soul upon the airâ Singing his prowess to the tenderfoot, And how at divers times in sundry ways He strewed the roadside with our carcasses. Clearly, the stage-coach will not pass to-night. Leland the Kid: I now remember that but yesterday I saw three ugly looking fellows start From Colfax with a gun apiece, and they Did seem on business of importance bent, Furtively casting all their eyes about And covering their tracks with all the care That business men do use. I think perhaps They were Directors of that rival line, The great Pacific Mail. If so, they have Indubitably taken in that coach, And we are overreached. Three times before This thing has happened, and if once again These outside operators dare to cut Our rates of profit I shall quit the road And take my money out of this concern. When robbery no longer pays expense It loses then its chiefest charm for me, And I prefer to cheatâyou hear me shout! Happy Hunty: My chief, you do but echo back my thoughts: This competition is the death of trade. 'Tis plain (unless we wish to go to work) Some other business we must early find. What shall it be? The field of usefulness Is yearly narrowing with the advance Of wealth and population on this coast. There's little left that any man can do Without some other fellow stepping in And doing it as well. If one essay To pick a pocket he is sure to feel (With what disgust I need not say to you) Another hand inserted in the same. You crack a crib at dead of night, and lo! As you explore the dining-room for plate You find in session there a graceless band Stuffing their coats with spoons, their skins with wine. And so it goes. Why, even undertake To salt a mine and you will find it rich With noble specimens placed there before! Leland the Kid: And yet this line of immigration has Advantages superior to aught That elsewhere offers: all these passengers, If punched with careâ Cowboy Charley: Significant remark! It opens up a prospect wide and fair, Suggesting to the thoughtful mindâmy mindâ A scheme that is the boss lay-out. Instead Of stopping passengers, let's carry them. Instead of crying out: âThrow up your hands!â Let's say: âWalk up and buy a ticket!â Why Should we unwieldy goods and bullion take, Watches and all such trifles, when we might Far better charge their value three times o'er For carrying them to market? Leland the Kid: Put it there, Old son! Happy Hunty: You take the cake, my dear. We'll build A mighty railroad through this pass, and then The stage folk will come up to us and squeal, And say: âIt is bad medicine for both; What will you give or take?â And then we'll sell. Cowboy Charley: Enlarge your notions, little one; this is No petty, slouching, opposition scheme, To be bought off like honest men and fools; Mine eye prophetic pierces through the mists That cloud the future, and I seem to see A well-devised and executed scheme Of wholesale robbery within the law (Made by ourselves)âgreat, permanent, sublime, And strong to grapple with the public throatâ Shaking the stuffing from the public purse, The tears from bankrupt merchants' eyes, the blood From widows' famished carcasses, the bread From orphans' mouths! Happy Hunty: Hooray! Leland the Kid: Hooray! All: Hooray! (They tear the masks from their faces, and discharging their shotguns, throw them into the chaparral. Then they join hands, dance and sing the following song): Ah! blessed to measure The glittering treasure! Ah! blessed to heap up the gold Untold That flows in a wide And deepening tideâ Rolled, rolled, rolled From multifold sources, Converging its courses Upon ourâ Leland the Kid: Just wait a bit, my pards: I seem to hear A sneaking grizzly cracking the dry twigs. Such an intrusion might deprive the State Of all the good that we intend it. Ha! (Enter Sootymug. He saunters carelessy in and gracefully leans his back against a redwood.) Sootymug: My boys, I thought I heard Some careless revelry, As if your minds were stirred By some new devilry. I too am in that line. Indeed, the mission On which I comeâ Happy Hunty: Here's more damned competition! (Curtain) A BAD NIGHT DRAMATIS PERSONÃ Villiam a Sen Needleson a Sidniduc Smiler a Scheister Ki-Yi a Trader Grimghast a Spader Saralthia a Lovelorn Nymph Nellibrac a Sweetun A Body; a Ghost; an Unmentionable Thing; Skulls; Hoodoos; etc. SceneâA Cemetery in San Francisco. Saralthia: The red half-moon is dipping to the west, And the cold fog invades the sleeping land. Lo! how the grinning skulls in the level light Litter the place! Methinks that every skull Is a most lifelike portrait of my Sen, Drawn by the hand of Death; each fleshless pate, Cursed with a ghastly grin to eyes unrubbed With love's magnetic ointment, seems to mine To smile an amiable smile like his Whose amiable smile IâI alone Am able to distinguish from his leer! See how the gathering coyotes flit Through the lit spaces, or with burning eyes Star the black shadows with a steadfast gaze! About my feet the poddy toads at play, Bulbously comfortable, try to hop, But tumble clumsily with all their warts; While pranking lizards, sliding up and down My limbs, as they were public roads, impart A singularly interesting chill. The circumstance and passion of the time, The cast and manner of the placeâthe spirit Of this confederate environment, Command the rights we come to celebrate Obedient to the Inspired Hagâ The seventh daughter of the seventh daughter, Who rules all destinies from Minna street, A dollar a destiny. Here at this grave, Which for my purposes thou, Jack of Spadesâ (to Grimghast) Corrupter than the thing that reeks belowâ Hast opened secretly, we'll work the charm. Now what's the hour? (Distant clock strikes thirteen.) Enoughâhale forth the stiff! (Grimghast by means of a boat-hook stands the coffin on end in the excavation; the lid crumbles, exposing the remains of a man.) Ha! Master Mouldybones, how fare you, sir? The Body: Poorly, I thank your ladyship; I miss Some certain fingers and an ear or two. There's something, too, gone wrong with my inside, And my periphery's not what it was. How can we serve each other, you and I? Nellibrac: O what a personable man! (Blushes bashfully, drops her eyes and twists the corner of her apron.) Saralthia: Yes, dear, A very proper and alluring male, And quite superior to Lubin Rroyd, Who has, however, this distinct advantageâ He is alive. Grimghast: Missus, these yer remains Was the boss singer back in '72, And used to allers git invites to go Down to Swellmont and sing at every feed. In t'other Villiam's time, that was, afore The gent that you've hooked onto bought the place. The Body (singing): Down among the sainted dead Many years I lay; Beetles occupied my head, Moles explored my clay. There we feasted day and nightâ I and bug and beast; They provided appetite And I supplied the feast. The raven is a dicky-bird, Saralthia (singing): The jackal is a daisy, Nellibrac (singing): The wall-mouse is a worthy third, A Spook (singing): But mortals all are crazy. Chorus of Skulls: O mortals all are crazy, Their intellects are hazy; In the growing moon they shake their shoon And trip it in the mazy. But when the moon is waning, Their senses they're regaining: They fall to prayer and from their hair Remove the straws remaining. Saralthia: That's right, Rogues' Gallery, pray keep it up: Your song recalls my Villiam's âAuld Lang Syne,â What time he came and (like an amorous bird That struts before the female of its kind, Warbling its knightly preference) piped high His cracked falsetto out of reach. Enoughâ Now let's to business. Nellibrac, sweet child, Saint Cloacina's future devotee, The time is ripe and rottenâgut the grip! (Nellibrac brings forward a valise and takes from it five articles of clothing, which, one by one, she lays upon the points of a magic pentagram that has thoughtfully inscribed itself in lines of light on the wet grass. The Body holds its late lamented nose.) Nellibrac (singing): Fragrant socks, by Villiam's toes Consecrated to the nose; Shirt that shows the well worn track Of the knuckles of his back, Handkerchief with mottled stains, Into which he blew his brains; Collar crying out for soapâ Prophet of the future rope; An unmentionable thing It would sicken me to sing. Unmentionable Thing (aside): What! I unmentionable? Just you wait! In all the family journals of the State You'll some time see that I'm described at length, With supereditorial grace and strength. Saralthia (singing): Throw them in the open tombâ They will cause his love to bloom With an amatory boom! Chorus of Invisible Hoodoos: Hoodoo, hoodoo, voudou-vet Villiam struggles in the net! By the power and intent Of the charm his strength is spent! By the virtue in each rag Blessed by the Inspired Hag He will be a willing victim Limp as if a donkey kicked him! By this awful incantation We decree his animationâ By the magic of our art Warm the cockles of his heart. Villiam, if alive or dead, Thou Saralthia shalt wed! (They cast the garments into the grave and push over the coffin. Grimghast fills up the hole. Hoodoos gradually become apparent in a phosphorescent light about the grave, holding one another's back-hair and dancing in a circle.) Hoodoos (singing): O we're the larrikin hoodoos! The chirruping, lirruping hoodoos! We mix things up that the Fates ordain, Bring back the past and the present detain, Postpone the future and sometimes tether The three and drive them abreast togetherâ We rollicking, frolicking hoodoos! To us all things are the same as none And nothing is that is under the sun. Seven's a dozen and never is then, Whether is what and what is when, A man is a tree and a cuckoo a cow For gold galore and silver enow To magical, mystical hoodoos! Saralthia: What monstrous shadow darkens all the place, (enter Smyler) Flung like a doom athwartâha!âthou? Portentous presence, art thou not the same That stalks with aspect horrible among Small youths and maidens, baring snaggy teeth, Champing their tender limbs till crimson spume, Flung from thy lips in cursing God and man, Incarnadines the land? Smyler: Thou dammid slut! (Exit Smyler.) Nellibrac: O what a pretty man! Saralthia: Now who is next? Of tramps and casuals this graveyard seems Prolific to a fault! (Enter Needleson, exhaling, prophetically, an odor of decayed eggs and, actually, one of unlaundered linen. He darts an intense regard at an adjacent marble angel and places his open hand behind his ear.) Needleson: Hay? (Exit Needleson.) Nellibrac: Sweet, sweet male! I yearn to play at Copenhagen with him! (Blushes diligently and energetically.) Chorus of Skulls: Hoodoos, hoodoos, disappearâ Some dread deity draws near! (Exeunt Hoodoos.) Smitten with a sense of doom, The dead are cowering in the tomb, Seas are calling, stars are falling And appalling is the gloom! Fragmentary flames are flung Through the air the trees among! Lo! each hill inclines its headâ Earth is bending 'neath his tread! (On the contrary, enter Villiam on a chip, navigating an odor of mignonette. Saralthia springs forward to put him in her pocket, but he is instantly retracted by an invisible string. She falls headlong, breaking her heart. ReÃ«nter Villiam, Needleson, Smyler. All gather about Saralthia, who loudly laments her accident. The Spirit of Tar-and-Feathers, rising like a black smoke in their midst, executes a monstrous wink of graphic and vivid significance, then contemplates them with an obviously baptismal intention. The cross on Bone Mountain takes fire, splendoring the peninsula. Tableau. Curtain.) ON STONE ON STONE As in a dream, strange epitaphs I see, Inscribed on yet unquarried stone, Where wither flowers yet unstrownâ The Campo Santo of the time to be. LORING PICKERING (After Pope) Here rests a writer, great but not immense, Born destitute of feeling and of sense. No power he but o'er his brain desiredâ How not to suffer it to be inspired. Ideas unto him were all unknown, Proud of the words which only were his own. So unreflecting, so confused his mind, Torpid in error, indolently blind, A fever Heaven to quicken him applied, But rather than revive, the sluggard died. A WATER-PIRATE Pause, strangerâwhence you lightly tread Bill Carr's immoral part has fled. For him no heart of woman burned, But all the rivers' heads he turned. Alas! he now lifts up his eyes In torment and for water cries, Entreating that he may procure One drop to cool his parched McClure! THE REV. JOSEPH HEMPHILL He preached that sickness he could floor By prayer and by commanding; When sick himself he sent for four Physicians in good standing. He was struck dead despite their care, For, fearing their dissension, He secretly put up a prayer, Thus drawing God's attention. OTHERS [Cynic perforce from studying mankind] Cynic perforce from studying mankind In the false volume of his single mind, He damned his fellows for his own unworth, And, bad himself, thought nothing good on earth. Yet, still so judging, and so erring still, Observing well, but understanding ill, His learning all was got by dint of sight, And what he knew by day he lost by night. When hired to flatter he would never cease Till those who'd paid for praises paid for peace. Not wholly miser and but half a knave, He yearned to squander but he lived to save, And did not, for he could not, cheat the grave. Hic jacet Pixley, scribe and muleteer: Step lightly, stranger, anywhere but here. [McAllister, of talents rich are rare] McAllister, of talents rich are rare, Lies at this spot at finish of his race.

[Judge Sawyer, whom in vain the people tried] Judge Sawyer, whom in vain the people tried To push from power, here is laid aside. Death only from the bench could ever start That clinging surface, his immortal part. In Sacramento City here This wooden monument we rear In memory of Dr. May, Whose smile even Death could not allay. He's buried, Heaven alone knows where, And only the hyenas care; This May-pole merely marks the spot Where, ere the wretch began to rot, Fame's trumpet, with its brazen bray, Bawled: âWho (and why) was Dr. May?â [Dennis Spencer's mortal coil] Dennis Spencer's mortal coil Here is laid away to spoilâ Great riparian who said Not a stream should leave its bed. Now his soul would have a river Turned upon its parching liver. [For those this mausoleum is erected] For those this mausoleum is erected Who Stanford to the Upper House elected.

Alas, no more he'll climb the sacred steep To wake the lyre and put the world to sleep! To his rapt lip his soul no longer springs And like a jaybird from a knot-hole sings. No more the clubmen, pickled with his wine, Expand their ears and hiccough: âThat's divine!â The genius of his purse no longer draws The pleasing thunders of a paid applause. All silent now; nor sound nor sense remains, Though riddances of worms improve his brains.

When he died the people, weeping (For they thought him only sleeping) Cried: âAlthough he now is quiet And his tongue is not a riot, Soon, the spell that binds him breaking, He a motion will be making. Then, alas, he'll rise and speak In support of it a week.â [Rash mortal! stay thy feet and look around] Rash mortal! stay thy feet and look aroundâ This vacant tomb as yet is holy ground; But soon, alas! Jim Fair will occupy These premisesâthen, holiness, good-bye! [Here Salomon's body reposes] Here Salomon's body reposes; Bring roses, ye rebels, bring roses. Set all of your drumsticks a-moving, Discretion and Valor approving; Discretionâhe always retreatedâ And Valorâthe dead he defeated. Bring roses, ye loyal, bring roses: As patriot here he re-poses. [When Waterman ended his bright career] When Waterman ended his bright career He left his wet name to history here. To carry it with him he thought unfair: 'Twould tantalize spirits of statemen There. [Here lies the remains of Fred Emerson Brooks] Here lies the remains of Fred Emerson Brooks, A poet, as every one knew by his looks Who hadn't, unluckily, met with his books. On civic occasions he sprang to the fore With poems consisting of stanzas three score. The men whom they deafened enjoyed them the more. In this peaceful spot, so the grave-diggers say, With pen, ink and paper they laid him awayâ The Poet-elect of the Judgment Day. [George Perry here is stiff and stark] George Perry here is stiff and stark, With stone at foot and stone at head. His heart was dark, his mind was darkâ âIgnorant ass!â the people said. Not ignorant but skilled, alas, In all the secrets of his trade: He knew more ways to be an ass Than any ass that ever brayed. [Here lies the last of Deacon Fitch] Here lies the last of Deacon Fitch, Whose business was to melt the pitch. Convenient to this sacred spot Lies Sammy, who applied it hot. 'Tis hardâso much alike they smellâ One's grave from t'other's grave to tell, But when his tomb the Deacon's burst (Of two he'll always be the first) He'll see by studying the stones That he's obtained his proper bones, Then, seeking Sammy's vault, unlock it, And put that person in his pocket. [Beneath this stone O'Donnell's tongue's at rest] Beneath this stone O'Donnell's tongue's at restâ Our noses by his spirit still addressed. Living or dead, he's equally Satanicâ His noise a terror and his smell a panic. [Hangman's hands laid in this tomb an] Hangman's hands laid in this tomb an Imp of Satan's getting, whom an Ancient legend says that woman Never boreâhe owed his birth To Sin herself. From Hell to Earth She brought the brat in secret state And laid him at the Golden Gate, And they named him Henry Vrooman. While with mortals here he stayed, His father frequently he played. Raised his birth-place and in other Playful ways begot his mother. [When Gabriel blows a dreadful blast] When Gabriel blows a dreadful blast And swears that Time's forever past, Days, weeks, months, years all one at last, Then Asa Fiske, lying here unblest, Will beat (and skin his hand) his breast: There'll be no rate of interest! [Here Porter Ashe is in the ground] Here Porter Ashe is in the ground Green grows the grass upon his mound. This patron of the turf, I vow, Ne'er served it half so well as now. [Here Stanford lies, who thought it odd] Here Stanford lies, who thought it odd That he should go to meet his God. He looked, until his eyes grew dim, For God to hasten to meet him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME VII THE DEVIL'S DICTIONARY A Abdication, n. An act whereby a sovereign attests his sense of the high temprature of the throne. [Poor Isabella's dead, whose abdication] Poor Isabella's dead, whose abdication Set all tongues wagging in the Spanish nation. For that performance 'twere unfair to scold her: She wisely left a throne too hot to hold her. To History she'll be no royal riddleâ Merely a plain parched pea that jumped the griddle. G. J. Abracadabra. [By Abracadabra we signify] By Abracadabra we signify An infinite number of things. 'Tis the answer to What? and How? and Why? And Whence? and Whither?âa word whereby The Truth (with the comfort it brings) Is open to all who grope in night, Crying for Wisdom's holy light. Whether the word is a verb or a noun Is knowledge beyond my reach. I only know that 'tis handed down From sage to sage, From age to ageâ An immortal part of speech! Of an ancient man the tale is told That he lived to be ten centuries old, In a cave on a mountain side. (True, he finally died.) The fame of his wisdom filled the land, For his head was bald, and you'll understand His beard was long and white And his eyes uncommonly bright. Philosophers gathered from far and near To sit at his feet and hear and hear, Though he never was heard To utter a word But âAbracadabra, abracadab, Abracada, abracad, Abraca, abrac, abra, ab!â 'Twas all he had, 'Twas all they wanted to hear, and each Made copious notes of the mystical speech, Which they published nextâ A trickle of text In a meadow of commentary. Mighty big books were these, In number, as leaves of trees; In learning, remarkableâvery! He's dead, As I said, And the books of the sages have perished, But his wisdom is sacredly cherished. In Abracadabra it solemnly rings, Like an ancient bell that forever swings. O, I love to hear That word make clear Humanity's General Sense of Things. Jamrach Holobom. Abscond, v. i. To âmove in a mysterious way,â commonly with the property of another. [Spring beckons! All things to the call respond] Spring beckons! All things to the call respond; The trees are leaving and cashiers abscond. Phela Orm. Absent, adj. Peculiarly exposed to the tooth of detraction; vilified; hopelessly in the wrong; superseded in the consideration and affection of another. [To men a man is but a mind. Who cares] To men a man is but a mind. Who cares What face he carries or what form he wears? But woman's body is the woman. O, Stay thou, my sweetheart, and do never go, But heed the warning words the sage hath said: A woman absent is a woman dead. Jogo Tyree. Abstainer, n. A weak person who yields to the temptation of denying himself a pleasure. A total abstainer is one who abstains from everything but abstention, and especially from inactivity in the affairs of others. [Said a man to a crapulent youth: âI thought] Said a man to a crapulent youth: âI thought You a total abstainer, my son.â âSo I am, so I am,â said the scapegrace caughtâ âBut not, sir, a bigoted one.â G. J. Accountability, n. The mother of caution. [âMy accountability, bear in mind,â] âMy accountability, bear in mind,â Said the Grand Vizier: âYes, yes,â Said the Shah: âI doâ'tis the only kind Of ability you possess.â Joram Tate.

Aim, n. The task we set our wishes to. [âCheer up! Have you no aim in life?â] âCheer up! Have you no aim in life?â She tenderly inquired. âAn aim? Well, no, I haven't, wife; The fact isâI have fired.â G. J. Allah, n. The Mahometan Supreme Being, as distinguished from the Christian, Jewish, and so forth. [Allah's good laws I faithfully have kept] Allah's good laws I faithfully have kept, And ever for the sins of man have wept; And sometimes kneeling in the temple I Have reverently crossed my hands and slept. Junker Barlow. Allegiance, n. [This thing Allegiance, as I suppose] This thing Allegiance, as I suppose, Is a ring fitted in the subject's nose, Whereby that organ is kept rightly pointed To smell the sweetness of the Lord's anointed. G. J. Alone, adj. In bad company. [In contact, lo! the flint and steel] In contact, lo! the flint and steel, By spark and flame, the thought reveal That he the metal, she the stone, Had cherished secretly alone. Booley Fito. Altar, n. The place whereon the priest formerly raveled out the small intestine of the sacrificial victim for purposes of divination and cooked its flesh for the gods. The word is now seldom used, except with reference to the sacrifice of their liberty and peace by a male and a female fool. [They stood before the altar and supplied] They stood before the altar and supplied The fire themselves in which their fat was fried. In vain the sacrifice!âno god will claim An offering burnt with an unholy flame. M. P. Nopput. Anoint, v. t. To grease a king or other great functionary already sufficiently slippery.

Yes, all you get,â Consenting, he did speak up; â'Tis better you should eat it, pet, Than put it in my teacup.â Joel Huck. Art, n. This word has no definition. Its origin is related as follows by the ingenious Father Gassalasca Jape, S. J. [One day a wagâwhat would the wretch be at?â] One day a wagâwhat would the wretch be at?â Shifted a letter of the cipher RAT, And said it was a god's name! Straight arose Fantastic priests and postulants (with shows, And mysteries, and mummeries, and hymns, And disputations dire that lamed their limbs) To serve his temple and maintain the fires, Expound the law, manipulate the wires. Amazed, the populace the rites attend, Believe whate'er they cannot comprehend, And, inly edified to learn that two Half-hairs joined so and so (as Art can do) Have sweeter values and a grace more fit Than Nature's hairs that never have been split, Bring cates and wines for sacrificial feasts, And sell their garments to support the priests. Ass, n. A public singer with a good voice but no ear. In Virginia City, Nevada, he is called the Washoe Canary, in Dakota, the Senator, and everywhere the Donkey. The animal is widely and variously celebrated in the literature, art and religion of every age and country; no other so engages and fires the human imagination as this noble vertebrate. Indeed, it is doubted by some (Ramasilus, lib. II., De Clem., and C. Stantatus, De Temperamente) if it is not a god; and as such we know it was worshiped by the Etruscans, and, if we may believe Macrobious, by the Cupasians also. Of the only two animals admitted into the Mahometan Paradise along with the souls of men, the ass that carried Balaam is one, the dog of the Seven Sleepers the other. This is no small distinction. From what has been written about this beast might be compiled a library of great splendor and magnitude, rivaling that of the Shakspearean cult, and that which clusters about the Bible. It may be said, generally, that all literature is more or less Asinine. [âHail, holy Ass!â the quiring angels sing] âHail, holy Ass!â the quiring angels sing; âPriest of Unreason, and of Discords King! Great co-Creator, let Thy glory shine: God made all else; the Mule, the Mule is thine!â G. J. Avernus, n. The lake by which the ancients entered the infernal regions. The fact that access to the infernal regions was obtained by a lake is believed by the learned Marcus Ansello Scrutator to have suggested the Christian rite of baptism by immersion. This, however, has been shown by Lactantius to be an error. [Facilis descensus Averni] Facilis descensus Averni, The poet remarks; and the sense Of it is that when down-hill I turn I Will get more of punches than pence. Jehal Dai Lupe. B Babe or Baby, n. A misshapen creature of no particular age, sex, or condition, chiefly remarkable for the violence of the sympathies and antipathies it excites in others, itself without sentiment or emotion. There have been famous babes; for example, little Moses, from whose adventure in the bulrushes the Egyptian hierophants of seven centuries before doubtless derived their idle tale of the child Osiris being preserved on a floating lotus leaf. [Ere babes were invented] Ere babes were invented The girls were contented. Now man is tormented Until to buy babes he has squandered His money. And so I have pondered This thing, and thought may be 'T were better that Baby The First had been eagled or condored. Ro Amil. Bacchus, n. A convenient deity invented by the ancients as an excuse for getting drunk. [Is public worship, then, a sin] Is public worship, then, a sin, That for devotions paid to Bacchus The lictors dare to run us in, And resolutely thump and whack us? Jorace. Baptism, n. A sacred rite of such efficacy that he who finds himself in heaven without having undergone it will be unhappy forever. It is performed with water in two waysâby immersion, or plunging, and by aspersion, or sprinkling. [But whether the plan of immersion] But whether the plan of immersion Is better than simple aspersion Let those immersed And those aspersed Decide by the Authorized Version, And by matching their agues tertian. G. J. Bath, n. A kind of mystic ceremony substituted for religious worship, with what spiritual efficacy has not been determined. [The man who taketh a steam bath] The man who taketh a steam bath He loseth all the skin he hath, And, for he's boiled a brilliant red, Thinketh to cleanliness he's wed, Forgetting that his lungs he's soiling With dirty vapors of the boiling. Richard Gwow. Beg, v. To ask for something with an earnestness proportioned to the belief that it will not be given. [Who is that, father?] Who is that, father? A mendicant, child, Haggard, morose, and unaffableâwild! See how he glares through the bars of his cell! With Citizen Mendicant all is not well. Why did they put him there, father? Because Obeying his belly he struck at the laws. His belly? Oh, well, he was starving, my boyâ A state in which, doubtless, there's little of joy. No bite had he eaten for days, and his cry Was âBread!â ever âBread!â What's the matter with pie? With little to wear, he had nothing to sell; To beg was unlawfulâimproper as well. Why didn't he work? He would even have done that, But men said: âGet out!â and the State remarked: âScat!â I mention these incidents merely to show That the vengeance he took was uncommonly low. Revenge, at the best, is the act of a Siou, But for triflesâ Pray what did bad Mendicant do? Stole two loaves of bread to replenish his lack And tuck out the belly that clung to his back. Is that all father dear? There is little to tell: They sent him to jail, and they'll send him toâwell, The company's better than here we can boast, And there'sâ Bread for the needy, dear father? Umâtoast. Atka Mip. Behavior, n. Conduct, as determined, not by principle, but by breeding. The word seems to be somewhat loosely used in Dr. Jamrach Holobom's translation of the following lines in the Dies IrÃ¦: [Recordare, Jesu pie] Recordare, Jesu pie, Quod sum causa tuÃ¦ viÃ¦. Ne me perdas illa die. Pray remember, sacred Savior, Whose the thoughtless hand that gave your Death-blow. Pardon such behavior. Benedictines, n. An order of monks otherwise known as black friars. [She thought it a crow, but it turned out to be] She thought it a crow, but it turned out to be A monk of St. Benedict croaking a text. âHere's one of an order of cooks,â said sheâ âBlack friars in this world, fried black in the next.â âThe Devil on Earthâ (London, 1712). Berenice's Hair, n. A constellation (Coma Berenices) named in honor of one who sacrificed her hair to save her husband. [Her locks an ancient lady gave] Her locks an ancient lady gave Her loving husband's life to save; And menâthey honored so the dameâ Upon some stars bestowed her name. But to our modern married fair, Who'd give their lords to save their hair, No stellar recognition's given. There are not stars enough in heaven. G. J. Body-snatcher, n. A robber of grave-worms. One who supplies the young physicians with that with which the old physicians have supplied the undertaker. The hyena. [âOne night,â a doctor said, âlast fall] âOne night,â a doctor said, âlast fall, I and my comrades, four in all, When visiting a graveyard stood Within the shadow of a wall. âWhile waiting for the moon to sink We saw a wild hyena slink About a new-made grave, and then Begin to excavate its brink! âShocked by the horrid act, we made A sally from our ambuscade, And, falling on the unholy beast, Dispatched him with a pick and spade.â Bettel K. Jhones. Brahma, n. He who created the Hindoos, who are preserved by Vishnu and destroyed by Sivaâa rather neater division of labor than is found among the deities of some other nations. The Abracadabranese, for example, are created by Sin, maintained by Theft and destroyed by Folly. The priests of Brahma, like those of the Abracadabranese, are holy and learned men who are never naughty. [O Brahma, thou rare old Divinity] O Brahma, thou rare old Divinity, First Person of the Hindoo Trinity, You sit there so calm and securely, With feet folded up so demurelyâ You're the First Person Singular, surely. Polydore Smith. C Carmelite, n. A mendicant friar of the order of Mount Carmel. [As Death was a-riding out one day] As Death was a-riding out one day, Across Mount Carmel he took his way, Where he met a mendicant monk, Some three or four quarters drunk, With a holy leer and a pious grin, Ragged and fat and as saucy as sin, Who held out his hands and cried: âGive, give in Charity's name, I pray. Give in the name of the Church. O give, Give that her holy sons may live!â And Death replied, Smiling long and wide: âI'll give, holy father, I'll give theeâa ride.â With a rattle and bang Of his bones, he sprang From his famous Pale Horse, with his spear; By the neck and the foot Seized the fellow, and put Him astride with his face to the rear. The Monarch laughed loud with a sound that fell Like clods on the coffin's sounding shell: âHo, ho! A beggar on horseback, they say, Will ride to the devil!ââand thump Fell the flat of his dart on the rump Of the charger, which galloped away. Faster and faster and faster it flew, Till the rocks and the flocks and the trees that grew By the road were dim and blended and blue To the wild, wide eyes Of the riderâin size Resembling a couple of blackberry pies. Death laughed again, as a tomb might laugh At a burial service spoiled, And the mourners' intentions foiled By the body erecting Its head and objecting To further proceedings in its behalf. Many a year and many a day Have passed since these events away. The monk has long been a dusty corse, And Death has never recovered his horse. For the friar got hold of its tail, And steered it within the pale Of the monastery gray, Where the beast was stabled and fed With barley and oil and bread Till fatter it grew than the fattest friar, And so in due course was appointed Prior. Cat, n. A soft, indestructible automaton provided by nature to be kicked when things go wrong in the domestic circle. [This is a dog] This is a dog, This is a cat, This is a frog, This is a rat. Run, dog, mew, cat, Jump, frog, gnaw, rat. Elevenson. Cemetery, n. An isolated suburban spot where mourners match lies, poets write at a target and stone-cutters spell for a wager. The inscriptions following will serve to illustrate the success attained in these Olympian games: His virtues were so conspicuous that his enemies, unable to overlook them, denied them, and his friends, to whose loose lives they were a rebuke, represented them as vices. They are here commemorated by his family, who shared them. [In the earth we here prepare a] In the earth we here prepare a Place to lay our little Clara. âThomas M. and Mary Frazer. P. S.âGabriel will raise her. Christian, n. One who believes that the New Testament is a divinely inspired book admirably suited to the spiritual needs of his neighbor. One who follows the teachings of Christ in so far as they are not inconsistent with a life of sin. [I dreamed I stood upon a hill, and, lo!] I dreamed I stood upon a hill, and, lo! The godly multitudes walked to and fro Beneath, in Sabbath garments fitly clad, With pious mien, appropriately sad, While all the church bells made a solemn dinâ A fire-alarm to those who lived in sin. Then saw I gazing thoughtfully below, With tranquil face, upon that holy show A tall, spare figure in a robe of white, Whose eyes diffused a melancholy light. âGod keep you, stranger,â I exclaimed. âYou are No doubt (your habit shows it) from afar; And yet I entertain the hope that you, Like these good people, are a Christian too.â He raised his eyes and with a look so stern It made me with a thousand blushes burn Repliedâhis manner with disdain was spiced: âWhat! I a Christian? No, indeed! I'm Christ.â G. J. Clock, n. A machine of great moral value to man, allaying his concern for the future by reminding him what a lot of time remains to him. [A busy man complained one day] A busy man complained one day: âI get no time!â âWhat's that you say?â Cried out his friend, a lazy quiz; âYou have, sir, all the time there is. There's plenty, too, and don't you doubt itâ We're never for an hour without it.â Purzil Crofe. Close-fisted, adj. Unduly desirous of keeping that which many meritorious persons wish to obtain. [âClose-fisted Scotchman!â Johnson cried] âClose-fisted Scotchman!â Johnson cried To thrifty J. Macpherson; âSee meâI'm ready to divide With any worthy person.â Said Jamie: âThat is very trueâ The boast requires no backing; And all are worthy, sir, to you, Who have what you are lacking.â Anita M. Bobe. CÅnobite, n. A man who piously shuts himself up to meditate upon the sin of wickedness; and to keep it fresh in his mind joins a brotherhood of awful examples. [O CÅnobite, O cÅnobite] O CÅnobite, O cÅnobite, Monastical gregarian, You differ from the anchorite, That solitudinarian: With vollied prayers you wound Old Nick; With dropping shots he makes him sick. Quincy Giles. Commonwealth, n. An administrative entity operated by an incalculable multitude of political parasites, logically active but fortuitously efficient. [This commonwealth's capitol's corridors view] This commonwealth's capitol's corridors view, So thronged with a hungry and indolent crew Of clerks, pages, porters and all attachÃ©s Whom rascals appoint and the populace pays That a cat cannot slip through the thicket of shins Nor hear its own shriek for the noise of their chins. On clerks and on pages, and porters, and all, Misfortune attend and disaster befall! May life be to them a succession of hurts; May fleas by the bushel inhabit their shirts; May aches and diseases encamp in their bones, Their lungs full of tubercles, bladders of stones; May microbes, bacilli, their tissues infest, And tapeworms securely their bowels digest; May corn-cobs be snared without hope in their hair, And frequent impalement their pleasure impair. Disturbed be their dreams by the awful discourse Of audible sofas sepulchrally hoarse, By chairs acrobatic and wavering floorsâ The mattress that kicks and the pillow that snores! Sons of cupidity, cradled in sin! Your criminal ranks may the death angel thin, Avenging the friend whom I couldn't work in. K. Q. Controversy, n. A battle in which spittle or ink replaces the injurious cannon-ball and the inconsiderate bayonet. [In controversy with the facile tongue] In controversy with the facile tongueâ That bloodless warfare of the old and youngâ So seek your adversary to engage That on himself he shall exhaust his rage, And, like a snake that's fastened to the ground, With his own fangs inflict the fatal wound. You ask me how this miracle is done? Adopt his own opinions, one by one, And taunt him to refute them; in his wrath He'll sweep them pitilessly from his path. Advance then gently all you wish to prove, Each proposition prefaced with, âAs you've So well remarked,â or, âAs you wisely say, And I cannot dispute,â or, âBy the way, This view of it which, better far expressed, Runs through your argument.â Then leave the rest To him, secure that he'll perform his trust And prove your views intelligent and just. Conmore Apel Brune. Corporal, n. A man who occupies the lowest rung of the military ladder. [Fiercely the battle raged and, sad to tell] Fiercely the battle raged and, sad to tell, Our corporal heroically fell! Fame from her height looked down upon the brawl And said: âHe hadn't very far to fall.â Giacomo Smith. Critic, n. A person who boasts himself hard to please because nobody tries to please him. [There is a land of pure delight] There is a land of pure delight, Beyond the Jordan's flood, Where saints, apparelled all in white, Fling back the critic's mud.

An ancient religious symbol erroneously supposed to owe its significance to the most solemn event in the history of Christianity, but really antedating it by thousands of years. By many it has been believed to be identical with the crux ansata of the ancient phallic worship, but it has been traced even beyond all that we know of that, to the rites of primitive peoples. We have to-day the White Cross as a symbol of chastity, and the Red Cross as a badge of benevolent neutrality in war. Having in mind the former, the reverend Father Gassalasca Jape smites the lyre to the effect following: [âBe good, be good!â the sisterhood] âBe good, be good!â the sisterhood Cry out in holy chorus, And, to dissuade from sin, parade Their various charms before us. But why, O why, has ne'er an eye Seen her of winsome manner And youthful grace and pretty face Flaunting the White Cross banner? Now where's the need of speech and screed To better our behaving? A simpler plan for saving man (But, first, is he worth saving?) Is, dears, when he declines to flee From bad thoughts that beset him, Ignores the Law as 't were a straw, And wants to sinâdon't let him. D Danger, n. [A savage beast which, when it sleeps] A savage beast which, when it sleeps, Man girds at and despises, But takes himself away by leaps And bounds when it arises. Ambat Delaso. Dead, adj. [Done with the work of breathing; done] Done with the work of breathing; done With all the world; the mad race run Through to the end; the golden goal Attained and found to be a hole! Squatol Johnes. Debt, n. An ingenious substitute for the chain and whip of the slave-driver. [As, pent in an aquarium, the troutlet] As, pent in an aquarium, the troutlet Swims round and round his tank to find an outlet, Pressing his nose against the glass that holds him, Nor ever sees the prison that enfolds him; So the poor debtor, seeing naught around him, Yet feels the narrow limits that impound him, Grieves at his debt and studies to evade it, And finds at last he might as well have paid it. Barlow S. Vode. Decalogue, n. A series of commandments, ten in numberâjust enough to permit an intelligent selection for observance, but not enough to embarrass the choice. Following is the revised edition of the Decalogue, calculated for this meridian. [Thou shalt no God but me adore] Thou shalt no God but me adore: 'Twere too expensive to have more. No images nor idols make For Robert Ingersoll to break. Take not God's name in vain; select A time when it will have effect. Work not on Sabbath days at all, But go to see the teams play ball. Honor thy parents. That creates For life insurance lower rates. Kill not, abet not those who kill; Thou shalt not pay thy butcher's bill. Kiss not thy neighbor's wife, unless Thine own thy neighbor doth caress. Don't steal; thou'lt never thus compete Successfully in business. Cheat. Bear not false witnessâthat is lowâ But âhear 'tis rumored so and so.â Covet thou naught that thou hast not By hook or crook, or somehow, got. G. J. Decide, v. i. To succumb to the preponderance of one set of influences over another set. [A leaf was riven from a tree] A leaf was riven from a tree, âI mean to fall to earth,â said he. The west wind, rising, made him veer. âEastward,â said he, âI now shall steer.â The east wind rose with greater force. Said he: â'Twere wise to change my course.â With equal power they contend. He said: âMy judgment I suspend.â Down died the winds; the leaf, elate, Cried: âI've decided to fall straight.â âFirst thoughts are best?â That's not the moral; Just choose your own and we'll not quarrel. Howe'er your choice may chance to fall, You'll have no hand in it at all. G. J. Delusion, n. The father of a most respectable family, comprising Enthusiasm, Affection, Self-denial, Faith, Hope, Charity and many other goodly sons and daughters. [All hail, Delusion! Were it not for thee] All hail, Delusion! Were it not for thee The world turned topsy-turvy we should see; For Vice, respectable with cleanly fancies, Would fly abandoned Virtue's gross advances. Mumfrey Mappel. Deputy, n. A male relative of an officeholder, or of his bondsman. The deputy is commonly a beautiful young man, with a red necktie and an intricate system of cobwebs extending from his nose to his desk. When accidentally struck by the janitor's broom, he gives off a cloud of dust. [âChief Deputy,â the Master cried] âChief Deputy,â the Master cried, âTo-day the books are to be tried By experts and accountants who Have been commissioned to go through Our office here, to see if we Have stolen injudiciously. Please have the proper entries made, The proper balances displayed, Conforming to the whole amount Of cash on handâwhich they will count. I've long admired your punctual wayâ Here at the break and close of day, Confronting in your chair the crowd Of business men, whose voices loud And gestures violent you quell By some mysterious, calm spellâ Some magic lurking in your look That brings the noisiest to book And spreads a holy and profound Tranquillity o'er all around. So orderly all's done that they Who came to draw remain to pay. But now the time demands, at last, That you employ your genius vast In energies more active. Rise And shake the lightnings from your eyes; Inspire your underlings, and fling Your spirit into everything!â The Master's hand here dealt a whack Upon the Deputy's bent back, When straightway to the floor there fell A shrunken globe, a rattling shell, A blackened, withered, eyeless head! The man had been a twelvemonth dead. Jamrach Holobom. Diary, n. A daily record of that part of one's life, which he can relate to himself without blushing. [Hearst kept a diary wherein were writ] Hearst kept a diary wherein were writ All that he had of wisdom and of wit. So the Recording Angel, when Hearst died, Erased all entries of his own and cried: âI'll judge you by your diary.â Said Hearst: âThank you; 'twill show you I am Saint the Firstââ Straightway producing, jubilant and proud, That record from a pocket in his shroud. The Angel slowly turned the pages o'er, Each stupid line of which he knew before, Glooming and gleaming as by turns he hit On shallow sentiment and stolen wit; Then gravely closed the book and gave it back. âMy friend, you've wandered from your proper track: You'd never be content this side the tombâ For big ideas Heaven has little room, And Hell's no latitude for making mirth,â He said, and kicked the fellow back to earth. âThe Mad Philosopher.â Die, n. The singular of âdice.â We seldom hear the word, because there is a prohibitory proverb, âNever say die.â At long intervals, however, some one says: âThe die is cast,â which is not true, for it is cut. The word is found in an immortal couplet by the eminent poet and domestic economist, Senator Depew: [A cube of cheese no larger than a die] A cube of cheese no larger than a die May bait the trap to catch a nibbling mie. Disobey, v. t. To celebrate with an appropriate ceremony the maturity of a command.

Duel, n. A formal ceremony preliminary to the reconciliation of two enemies. Great skill is necessary to its satisfactory observance; if awkwardly performed the most unexpected and deplorable consequences sometimes ensue. A long time ago a man lost his life in a duel. [That dueling's a gentlemanly vice] That dueling's a gentlemanly vice I hold; and wish that it had been my lot To live my life out in some favored spotâ Some country where it is considered nice To split a rival like a fish, or slice A husband like a spud, or with a shot Bring down a debtor doubled in a knot And ready to be put upon the ice. Some miscreants there are, whom I do long To shoot, or stab, or some such way reclaim The scurvy rogues to better lives and manners, I seem to see them nowâa mighty throng. It looks as if to challenge me they came, Jauntily marching with brass bands and banners! Xamba Q. Dar. Duty, n. That which sternly impels us in the direction of profit, along the line of desire. [Sir Lavender Portwine, in favor at court] Sir Lavender Portwine, in favor at court, Was wroth at his master, who'd kissed Lady Port.

Secretly to overhear a catalogue of the crimes and vices of another or yourself. [A lady with one of her ears applied] A lady with one of her ears applied To an open keyhole heard, inside, Two female gossips in converse freeâ The subject engaging them was she. âI think,â said one, âand my husband thinks That she's a prying, inquisitive minx!â As soon as no more of it she could hear The lady, indignant, removed her ear. âI will not stay,â she said, with a pout, âTo hear my character lied about!â Gopete Sherany. Editor, n. A person who combines the judicial functions of Minos, Rhadamanthus and Ãacus, but is placable with an obolus; a severely virtuous censor, but so charitable withal that he tolerates the virtues of others and the vices of himself; who flings about him the splintering lightning and sturdy thunders of admonition till he resembles a bunch of firecrackers petulantly uttering its mind at the tail of a dog; then straightway murmurs a mild, melodious lay, soft as the cooing of a donkey intoning its prayer to the evening star. Master of mysteries and lord of law, high-pinnacled upon the throne of thought, his face suffused with the dim splendors of the Transfiguration, his legs intertwisted and his tongue a-cheek, the editor spills his will along the paper and cuts it off in lengths to suit. And at intervals from behind the veil of the temple is heard the voice of the foreman demanding three inches of wit and six lines of religious meditation, or bidding him turn off the wisdom and whack up some pathos. [O, the Lord of Law on the Throne of Thought] O, the Lord of Law on the Throne of Thought, A gilded impostor is he. Of shreds and patches his robes are wrought, His crown is brass, Himself is an ass, And his power is fiddle-dee-dee. Prankily, crankily prating of naught, Silly old quilly old Monarch of Thought. Public opinion's camp-follower he, Thundering, blundering, plundering free. Affected, Ungracious, Suspected, Mendacious, Respected contemporaree! J. H. Bumbleshook. Egotist, n. A person of low taste, more interested in himself than in me. [Megaceph, chosen to serve the State] Megaceph, chosen to serve the State In the halls of legislative debate, One day with all his credentials came To the capitol's door and announced his name.

A composition in verse, in which, without employing any of the methods of humor, the writer aims to produce in the reader's mind the dampest kind of dejection. The most famous English example begins somewhat like this: [The cur foretells the knell of parting day] The cur foretells the knell of parting day; The loafing herd winds slowly o'er the lea; The wise man homeward plods; I only stay To fiddle-faddle in a minor key. Emancipation, n. A bondman's change from the tyranny of another to the despotism of himself.

[The man was perishing apace] The man was perishing apace Who played the tambourine: The seal of death was on his faceâ 'Twas pallid, for 'twas clean. âThis is the end,â the sick man said In faint and failing tones.

Erudition, n. Dust shaken out of a book into an empty skull.

Romach Pute. Excess, n. In morals, an indulgence that enforces by appropriate penalties the law of moderation. [Hail, high Excessâespecially in wine] Hail, high Excessâespecially in wine. To thee in worship do I bend the knee Who preach abstemiousness unto meâ My skull thy pulpit, as my paunch thy shrine. Precept on precept, aye, and line on line, Could ne'er persuade so sweetly to agree With reason as thy touch, exact and free, Upon my forehead and along my spine. At thy command eschewing pleasure's cup, With the hot grape I warm no more my wit; When on thy stool of penitence I sit I'm quite converted, for I can't get up. Ungrateful he who afterward would falter To make new sacrifices at thine altar! Excommunication, n. [This âexcommunicationâ is a word] This âexcommunicationâ is a word In speech ecclesiastical oft heard, And means the damning, with bell, book and candle, Some sinner whose opinions are a scandalâ A rite permitting Satan to enslave him Forever, and forbidding Christ to save him. Gat Huckle. Existence, n.

[A king there was who lost an eye] A king there was who lost an eye In some excess of passion; And straight his courtiers all did try To follow the new fashion. Each dropped one eyelid when before The throne he ventured, thinking 'Twould please the king. That monarch swore He'd slay them all for winking. What should they do? They were not hot To hazard such disaster; They dared not close an eyeâdared not See better than their master. Seeing them lacrymose and glum, A leech consoled the weepers: He spread small rags with liquid gum And covered half their peepers. The court all wore the stuff, the flame Of royal anger dying. That's how court-plaster got its name Unless I'm greatly lying. Naramy Oof. Female, n. One of the opposing, or unfair, sex. [The Maker, at Creation's birth] The Maker, at Creation's birth, With living things had stocked the earth. From elephants to bats and snails, They all were good, for all were males. But when the Devil came and saw He said: âBy Thine eternal law Of growth, maturity, decay, These all must quickly pass away And leave untenanted the earth Unless Thou dost establish birthââ Then tucked his head beneath his wing To laughâhe had no sleeveâthe thing With deviltry did so accord, That he'd suggested to the Lord. The Master pondered this advice, Then shook and threw the fateful dice Wherewith all matters here below Are ordered, and observed the throw; Then bent His head in awful state, Confirming the decree of Fate. From every part of earth anew The conscious dust consenting flew, While rivers from their courses rolled To make it plastic for the mould. Enough collected (but no more, For niggard Nature hoards her store) He kneaded it to flexile clay, While Nick unseen threw some away. And then the various forms He cast, Gross organs first and finer last; No one at once evolved, but all By even touches grew and small Degrees advanced, till, shade by shade, To match all living things He'd made Females, complete in all their parts Except (His clay gave out) the hearts. âNo matter,â Satan cried; âwith speed I'll fetch the very hearts they needââ So flew away and soon brought back The number needed, in a sack. That night earth rang with sounds of strifeâ Ten million males had each a wife; That night sweet Peace her pinions spread O'er Hellâten million devils dead! G. J. Fib, n. A lie that has not cut its teeth. An habitual liar's nearest approach to truth: the perigee of his eccentric orbit. [When David said: âAll men are liars,â Dave] When David said: âAll men are liars,â Dave, Himself a liar, fibbed like any thief. Perhaps he thought to weaken disbelief By proof that even himself was not a slave To Truth; though I suspect the aged knave Had been of all her servitors the chief Had he but known a fig's reluctant leaf Is more than e'er she wore on land or wave. No, David served not Naked Truth when he Struck that sledge-hammer blow at all his race; Nor did he hit the nail upon the head: For reason shows that it could never be, And the facts contradict him to his face. Men are not liars all, for some are dead. Bartle Quinker. Fiddle, n. An instrument to tickle human ears by friction of a horse's tail on the entrails of a cat.

[Folly! although Erasmus praised thee once] Folly! although Erasmus praised thee once In a thick volume, and all authors known, If not thy glory yet thy power have shown, Deign to take homage from thy son who hunts Through all thy maze his brothers, fool and dunce, To mend their lives and to sustain his own, However feebly be his arrows thrown, Howe'er each hide the flying weapons blunts. All-Father Folly! be it mine to raise, With lusty lung, here on this western strand With all thine offspring thronged from every land, Thyself inspiring me, the song of praise. And if too weak, I'll hire, to help me bawl, Dick Watson Gilder, gravest of us all. Aramis Loto Frope. Force, n. [âForce is but might,â the teacher said] âForce is but might,â the teacher saidâ âThat definition's just.â The boy said naught but thought instead, Remembering his pounded head: âForce is not might but must!â Forma Pauperis (Latin).

G. J. Freedom, n. Exemption from the stress of authority in a beggarly half dozen of restraint's infinite multitude of methods. A political condition that every nation supposes itself to enjoy in virtual monopoly. Liberty. The distinction between freedom and liberty is not accurately known; naturalists have never been able to find a living specimen of either. [Freedom, as every schoolboy knows] Freedom, as every schoolboy knows, Once shrieked as Kosciusko fell; On every wind, indeed, that blows I hear her yell. She screams whenever monarchs meet, And parliaments as well, To bind the chains about her feet And toll her knell.

For all to whom the power's given To sway or to compel, Among themselves apportion Heaven And give her Hell. Blary O'Gary. Friendship, n. A ship big enough to carry two in fair weather, but only one in foul. [The sea was calm and the sky was blue] The sea was calm and the sky was blue; Merrily, merrily sailed we two.

One part of the penal apparatus employed in that punitive institution, a woman's kitchen. The frying-pan was invented by Calvin, and by him used in cooking span-long infants that had died without baptism; and observing one day the horrible torment of a tramp who had incautiously pulled a fried babe from the waste-dump and devoured it, it occurred to the great divine to rob death of its terrors by introducing the frying-pan into every household in Geneva. Thence it spread to all corners of the world, and has been of invaluable assistance in the propagation of his sombre faith. The following lines (said to be from the pen of his Grace Bishop Potter) seem to imply that the usefulness of this utensil is not limited to this world; but as the consequences of its employment in this life reach over into the life to come, so also itself may be found on the other side, rewarding its devotees: [Old Nick was summoned to the skies] Old Nick was summoned to the skies. Said Peter: âYour intentions Are good, but you lack enterprise Concerning new inventions. âNow, broiling is an ancient plan Of torment, but I hear it Reported that the frying-pan Sears best the wicked spirit. âGo get oneâfill it up with fatâ Fry sinners brown and good in't.â âI know a trick worth two o' that,â Said NickââI'll cook their food in't.â Funeral, n.

The stars that danced before his ken He wildly brushed away, and then He saw a post. Jared Macphester. Gnu, n.

The water-drinkers and the cranks Who load their skins with liquorâ I'll gladly bare their belly-tanks And tap them with my sticker.

A place in which the dead are laid to await the coming of the medical student. [Beside a lonely grave I stood] Beside a lonely grave I stoodâ With brambles 'twas encumbered; The winds were moaning in the wood, Unheard by him who slumbered.

Plain iron forceps we employ To mitigate the miser's joy Who hoards, with greed that never tires, That which your Majesty requires.â Deep lines of thought were seen to plow Their way across the royal brow. âYour state is desperate, no question; Pray favor me with a suggestion.â âO King of Men,â the spokesman said, âIf you'll impose upon each head A tax, the augmented revenue We'll cheerfully divide with you.â As flashes of the sun illume The parted storm-cloud's sullen gloom, The king smiled grimly. âI decree That it be soâand, not to be In generosity outdone, Declare you, each and every one, Exempted from the operation Of this new law of capitation. But lest the people censure me Because they're bound and you are free, 'Twere well some clever scheme were laid By you this poll-tax to evade.

Though Hebrew and Howison cannot agree On a modus vivendiânot they!â Yet Heaven has had the designing of me, And I haven't been reared in a way To joy in the thick of the fray. For this of my creed is the soul and the gist, And the truth of it I aver: Who differs from me in his faith is an 'ist, An 'ite, an 'ic, or an 'erâ And I'm down upon him or her! Let Howison urge with perfunctory chin Tolerationâthat's all very well, But a roast is ânutsâ to his nostril thin, And he's runningâI know by the smellâ A secret and personal Hell!

Ignoramus, n. A person unacquainted with certain kinds of knowledge familiar to yourself, and having certain other kinds that you know nothing about. [Dumble was an ignoramus] Dumble was an ignoramus, Mumble was for learning famous. Mumble said one day to Dumble: âIgnorance should be more humble. Not a spark have you of knowledge That was got in any college.â Dumble said to Mumble: âTruly You're self-satisfied unduly. Of things in college I'm denied A knowledgeâyou of all beside.â Borelli. Immodest, adj. Having a strong sense of one's own merit, coupled with a feeble conception of worth in others. [There was once a man in Ispahan] There was once a man in Ispahan Ever and ever so long ago, And he had a head, the phrenologists said, That fitted him for a show. For his modesty's bump was so large a lump (Nature, they said, had taken a freak) That its summit stood far above the wood Of his hair, like a mountain peak. So modest a man in all Ispahan, Over and over again they sworeâ So humble and meek, you would vainly seek; None ever was found before. Meantime the hump of that awful bump Into the heavens contrived to get To so great a height that they called the wight The man with a minaret. There wasn't a man in all Ispahan Prouder, or louder in praise of his chump: With a tireless tongue and a brazen lung He bragged of that beautiful bump Till the Shah in a rage sent a trusty page Bearing a sack and a bow-string too, And that gentle child explained as he smiled: âA little present for you.â The saddest man in all Ispahan, Sniffed at the gift, yet accepted the same. âIf I'd lived,â said he, âmy humility Had given me deathless fame!â Sukker Uffro. Immortality, n. [A toy which people cry for] A toy which people cry for, And on their knees apply for, Dispute, contend and lie for, And if allowed Would be right proud Eternally to die for. G. J. Imposition, n. The act of blessing or consecrating by the laying on of handsâa ceremony common to many ecclesiastical systems, but performed with the frankest sincerity by the sect known as Thieves. [âLo! by the laying on of hands,â] âLo! by the laying on of hands,â Say parson, priest and dervise, âWe consecrate your cash and lands To ecclesiastic service. No doubt you'll swear till all is blue At such an imposition. Do.â Pollo Doncas. Improbability, n. [His tale he told with a solemn face] His tale he told with a solemn face And a tender, melancholy grace. Improbable 'twas, no doubt, When you came to think it out, But the fascinated crowd Their deep surprise avowed And all with a single voice averred 'Twas the most amazing thing they'd heardâ All save one who spake never a word, But sat as mum As if deaf and dumb, Serene, indifferent and unstirred. Then all the others turned to him And scrutinized him limb from limbâ Scanned him alive; But he seemed to thrive And tranquiler grow each minute, As if there were nothing in it. âWhat! what!â cried one, âare you not amazed At what our friend has told?â He raised Soberly then his eyes and gazed In a natural way And proceeded to say, As he crossed his feet on the mantel-shelf: âO noânot at all; I'm a liar myself.â Inauspiciously, adv. In an unpromising manner, the auspices being unfavorable. Among the Romans it was customary before undertaking any important action or enterprise to obtain from the augurs, or state prophets, some hint of its probable outcome; and one of their favorite and most trustworthy modes of divination consisted in observing the flight of birdsâthe omens thence derived being called auspices. Newspaper reporters and certain miscreant lexicographers have decided that the wordâalways in the pluralâshall mean âpatronageâ or âmanagementâ; as, âThe festivities were under the auspices of the Ancient and Honorable Order of Body-Snatchersâ; or, âThe hilarities were auspicated by the Knights of Hunger.â [A Roman slave appeared one day] A Roman slave appeared one day Before the Augur. âTell me, pray, Ifââ here the Augur, smiling, made A checking gesture and displayed His open palm, which plainly itched, For visibly its surface twitched. A denarius (the Latin nickel) Successfully allayed the tickle, And then the slave proceeded: âPlease Inform me whether Fate decrees Success or failure in what I To-night (if it be dark) shall try. Its nature? Never mindâI think 'Tis writ on thisââand with a wink Which darkened half the earth, he drew Another denarius to view, Its shining face attentive scanned, Then slipped it into the good man's hand, Who with great gravity said: âWait While I retire to question Fate.â That holy person then withdrew His sacred clay and, passing through The temple's rearward gate, cried âShoo!â Waving his robe of office. Straight Each sacred peacock and its mate (Maintained for Juno's favor) fled With clamor from the trees o'erhead, Where they were perching for the night. The temple's roof received their flight, For thither they would always go, When danger threatened them below. Back to the slave the Augur went: âMy son, forecasting the event By flight of birds, I must confess The auspices deny success.â That slave retired, a sadder man, Abandoning his secret planâ Which was (as well the crafty seer Had from the first divined) to clear The wall and fraudulently seize On Juno's poultry in the trees. G. J. Indifferent, adj. Imperfectly sensible to distinctions among things. [âYou tiresome man!â cried Indolentio's wife] âYou tiresome man!â cried Indolentio's wife, âYou've grown indifferent to all in life.â âIndifferent?â he drawled with a slow smile; âI would be, dear, but it is not worth while.â Apuleius M. Gokul. Infralapsarian, n. One who ventures to believe that Adam need not have sinned unless he had a mind toâin opposition to the Supralapsarians, who hold that that luckless person's fall was decreed from the beginning. Infralapsarians are sometimes called Sublapsarians without material effect upon the importance and lucidity of their views about Adam. [Two theologues once, as they wended their way] Two theologues once, as they wended their way To chapel, engaged in colloquial frayâ An earnest logomachy, bitter as gall, Concerning poor Adam and what made him fall. â'Twas Predestination,â cried oneââfor the Lord Decreed he should fall of his own accord.â âNot soâ'twas Free will,â the other maintained, âWhich led him to choose what the Lord had ordained.â So fierce and so fiery grew the debate That nothing but bloodshed their dudgeon could sate; So off flew their cassocks and caps to the ground And, moved by the spirit, their hands went round. Ere either had proved his theology right By winning, or even beginning, the fight, A gray old professor of Latin came by, A staff in his hand and a scowl in his eye, And learning the cause of their quarrel (for still As they clumsily sparred they disputed with skill Of foreordinational freedom of will) Cried: âSirrahs! this reasonless warfare compose: Atwixt ye's no difference worthy of blows. The sects ye belong toâI'm ready to swear Ye wrongly interpret the names that they bear. YouâInfralapsarian son of a clown!â Should only contend that Adam slipped down; While youâyou Supralapsarian pup!â Should nothing aver but that Adam slipped up.â It's all the same whether up or down You slip on a peel of banana brown. Even Adam analyzed not his blunder, But thought he had slipped on a peal of thunder! G. J. Ingrate, n. One who receives a benefit from another, or is otherwise an object of charity. [âAll men are ingrates,â sneered the cynic. âNay,â] âAll men are ingrates,â sneered the cynic. âNay,â The good philanthropist replied; âI did great service to a man one day Who never since has cursed me to repay, Nor vilified.â âHo!â cried the cynic, âlead me to him straightâ With veneration I am overcome, And fain would have his blessing.â âSad your fateâ He cannot bless you, for I grieve to state The man is dumb.â Ariel Selp. Inscription, n. Something written on another thing. Inscriptions are of many kinds, but mostly memorial, intended to commemorate the fame of some illustrious person and hand down to distant ages the record of his services and virtues. To this class of inscriptions belongs the name of John Smith, penciled on the Washington monument. Following are examples of memorial inscriptions on tombstones: (See Epitaph.) [In the sky my soul is found] âIn the sky my soul is found, And my body in the ground. By and by my body'll rise To my spirit in the skies, Soaring up to Heaven's gate. 1878.â âSacred to the memory of Jeremiah Tree. Cut down May 9th, 1862, aged 27 yrs. 4 mos. and 12 ds. Indigenous.â [Affliction sore long time she boar] âAffliction sore long time she boar, Phisicians was in vain, Till Deth released the dear deceased And left her a remain. Gone to join Ananias in the regions of bliss.â [The clay that rests beneath this stone] âThe clay that rests beneath this stone As Silas Wood was widely known. Now, lying here, I ask what good It was to me to be S. Wood. O Man, let not ambition trouble you, Is the advice of Silas W.â âRichard Haymon, of Heaven. Fell to Earth Jan. 20, 1807, and had the dust brushed off him Oct. 3, 1874.â Insectivora, n. [âSee,â cries the chorus of admiring preachers] âSee,â cries the chorus of admiring preachers, âHow Providence provides for all His creatures!â âHis care,â the gnat said, âeven the insects follows: For us He has provided wrens and swallows.â Sempen Railey. Intimacy, n. A relation into which fools are providentially drawn for their mutual destruction. [Two Seidlitz powders, one in blue] Two Seidlitz powders, one in blue And one in white, together drew, And having each a pleasant sense Of t'other powder's excellence, Forsook their jackets for the snug Enjoyment of a common mug. So close their intimacy grew One paper would have held the two. To confidences straight they fell, Less anxious each to hear than tell; Then each remorsefully confessed To all the virtues he possessed, Acknowledging he had them in So high degree it was a sin. The more they said, the more they felt Their spirits with emotion melt, Till tears of sentiment expressed Their feelings. Then they effervesced! So Nature executes her feats Of wrath on friends and sympathetes The good old rule who won't apply, That you are you and I am I. J Jester, n. An officer formerly attached to a king's household, whose business it was to amuse the court by ludicrous actions and utterances, the absurdity being attested by his motley costume. The king himself being attired with dignity, it took the world some centuries to discover that his own conduct and decrees were sufficiently ridiculous for the amusement not only of his court but of all mankind. The jester was commonly called a fool, but the poets and romancers have ever delighted to represent him as a singularly wise and witty person. In the circus of to-day the melancholy ghost of the court fool effects the dejection of humbler audiences with the same jests wherewith in life he gloomed the marble hall, panged the patrician sense of humor and tapped the tank of royal tears. [The widow-queen of Portugal] The widow-queen of Portugal Had an audacious jester Who entered the confessional Disguised, and there confessed her. âFather,â she said, âthine ear bend downâ My sins are more than scarlet: I love my foolâblaspheming clown, And common, base-born varlet.â âDaughter,â the mimic priest replied, âThat sin, indeed, is awful: The church's pardon is denied To love that is unlawful. âBut since thy stubborn heart will be For him forever pleading, Thou'dst better make him, by decree, A man of birth and breeding.â She made the fool a duke, in hope With Heaven's taboo to palter; Then told a priest, who told the Pope, Who damned her from the altar! Barel Dort. K Keep, v. t. [He willed away his whole estate] He willed away his whole estate, And then in death he fell asleep, Murmuring: âWell, at any rate, My name unblemished I shall keep.â But when upon the tomb 'twas wrought Whose was it?âfor the dead keep naught. Durang Gophel Arn. King, n. A male person commonly known in America as a âcrowned head,â although he never wears a crown and has usually no head to speak of. [A king, in times long, long gone by] A king, in times long, long gone by, Said to his lazy jester: âIf I were you and you were I My moments merrily would flyâ No care nor grief to pester.â âThe reason, Sire, that you would thrive,â The fool saidââif you'll hear itâ Is that of all the fools alive Who own you for their sovereign, I've The most forgiving spirit.â Oogum Bem. King's Evil, n. A malady that was formerly cured by the touch of the sovereign, but has now to be treated by the physicians. Thus âthe most pious Edwardâ of England used to lay his royal hand upon his ailing subjects and make them wholeâ [a crowd of wretched souls] a crowd of wretched souls That stay his cure: their malady convinces The great essay of art; but at his touch, Such sanctity hath Heaven given his hand, They presently amend, as the âDoctorâ in Macbeth hath it. This useful property of the royal hand could, it appears, be transmitted along with other crown properties; for according to âMalcolm,â ['tis spoken] 'tis spoken, To the succeeding royalty he leaves The healing benediction. But the gift somewhere dropped out of the line of succession: the later sovereigns of England have not been tactual healers, and the disease once honored with the name âking's evilâ now bears the humbler one of âscrofula,â from scrofa, a sow. The date and author of the following epigram are known only to the author of this dictionary, but it is old enough to show that the jest about Scotland's national disorder is not a thing of yesterday. [Y? Kynge his evill in me laye] Y? Kynge his evill in me laye, Wh. he of Scottlande charmed awaye. He layde his hand on mine and sayd: âBe gone!â Y? ill no longer stayd. But O y? wofull plyght in wh. I'm now y-pight: I have y? itche! The superstition that maladies can be cured by royal taction is dead, but like many a departed conviction it has left a monument of custom to keep its memory green. The practice of forming in line and shaking the President's hand had no other origin, and when that great dignitary bestows his healing salutation on ['strangely visited people] 'strangely visited people, All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye, The mere despair of surgery, he and his patients are handing along an extinguished torch which once was kindled at the altar-fire of a faith long held by all classes of men. It is a beautiful and edifying âsurvivalââone which brings the sainted past close home to our âbusiness and bosoms.â Knight, n. [Once a warrior gentle of birth] Once a warrior gentle of birth, Then a person of civic worth, Now a fellow to move our mirth. Warrior, person, and fellowâno more: We must knight our dogs to get any lower. Brave Knights Kennelers then shall be, Noble Knights of the Golden Flea, Knights of the Order of St. Steboy, Knights of St. Gorge and Sir Knights Jawy. God speed the day when this knighting fad Shall go to the dogs and the dogs go mad. L Land, n. A part of the earth's surface, considered as property. The theory that land is property subject to private ownership and control is the foundation of modern society, and is eminently worthy of the superstructure. Carried to its logical conclusion, it means that some have the right to prevent others from living; for the right to own implies the right exclusively to occupy; and in fact laws of trespass are enacted wherever property in land is recognized. It follows that if the whole area of terra firma is owned by A, B and C, there will be no place for D, E, F and G to be born, or, born as trespassers, to exist. [A life on the ocean wave] A life on the ocean wave, A home on the rolling deep, For the spark that nature gave I have there the right to keep. They give me the cat-o'-nine Whenever I go ashore. Then ho! for the flashing brineâ I'm a natural commodore! Dodle. Last, n. A shoemaker's implement, named by a frowning Providence as opportunity to the maker of puns. [Ah, punster, would my lot were cast] Ah, punster, would my lot were cast, Where the cobbler is unknown, So that I might forget his last And hear your own. Gargo Repsky. Law, n. [Once Law was sitting on the bench] Once Law was sitting on the bench, And Mercy knelt a-weeping. âClear out!â he cried, âdisordered wench! Nor come before me creeping. Upon your knees if you appear, 'Tis plain your have no standing here.â Then Justice came. His Honor cried: âYour status?âdevil seize you!â âAmica curiae,â she repliedâ âFriend of the court, so please you.â âBegone!â he shoutedââthere's the doorâ I never saw your face before!â G. J. Lead, n. A heavy blue-gray metal much used in giving stability to light loversâparticularly to those who love not wisely but other men's wives. Lead is also of great service as a counterpoise to an argument of such weight that it turns the scale of debate the wrong way. An interesting fact in the chemistry of international controversy is that at the point of contact of two patriotisms lead is precipitated in great quantities. [Hail, holy Lead!âof human feuds the great] Hail, holy Lead!âof human feuds the great And universal arbiter; endowed With penetration to pierce any cloud Fogging the field of controversial hate, And with a swift, inevitable, straight, Searching precision find the unavowed But vital point. Thy judgment, when allowed By the chirurgeon, settles the debate. O useful metal!âwere it not for thee We'd grapple one another's ears alway: But when we hear thee buzzing like a bee We, like old Muhlenberg, âcare not to stay.â And when the quick have run away like pullets Jack Satan smelts the dead to make new bullets. Leonine, adj. Unlike a menagerie lion. Leonine verses are those in which a word in the middle of a line rhymes with a word at the end, as in this famous passage from Bella Peeler Silcox: [The electric light invades the dunnest deep of Hades] The electric light invades the dunnest deep of Hades. Cries Pluto, 'twixt his snores: âO tempora! O mores!â It should be explained that Mrs. Silcox does not undertake to teach the pronunciation of the Greek and Latin tongues. Leonine verses are so called in honor of a poet named Leo, whom prosodists appear to find a pleasure in believing to have been the first to discover that a rhyming couplet could be run into a single line. Lexicographer, n. A pestilent fellow who, under the pretense of recording some particular stage in the development of a language, does what he can to arrest its growth, stiffen its flexibility and mechanize its methods. For your lexicographer, having written his dictionary, comes to be considered âas one having authority,â whereas his function is only to make a record, not to give a law. The natural servility of the human understanding having invested him with judicial power, surrenders its right of reason and submits itself to a chronicle as if it were a statute. Let the dictionary (for example) mark a good word as âobsoleteâ or âobsolescentâ and few men thereafter venture to use it, whatever their need of it and however desirable its restoration to favorâwhereby the process of impoverishment is accelerated and speech decays. On the contrary, the bold and discerning writer who, recognizing the truth that language must grow by innovation if it grow at all, makes new words and uses the old in an unfamiliar sense, has no following and is tartly reminded that âit isn't in the dictionaryââalthough down to the time of the first lexicographer (Heaven forgive him!) no author ever had used a word that was in the dictionary. In the golden prime and high noon of English speech; when from the lips of the great Elizabethans fell words that made their own meaning and carried it in their very sound; when a Shakspeare and a Bacon were possible, and the language now rapidly perishing at one end and slowly renewed at the other was in vigorous growth and hardy preservationâsweeter than honey and stronger than a lionâthe lexicographer was a person unknown, the dictionary a creation which his Creator had not created him to create. [God said: âLet Spirit perish into Form,â] God said: âLet Spirit perish into Form,â And lexicographers arose, a swarm! Thought fled and left her clothing, which they took, And catalogued each garment in a book. Now, from her leafy covert when she cries: âGive me my clothes and I'll return,â they rise And scan the list, and say without compassion: âExcuse usâthey are mostly out of fashion.â Sigismund Smith. Liberty, n. One of Imagination's most precious possessions. [The rising People, hot and out of breath] The rising People, hot and out of breath, Roared round the palace: âLiberty or death!â âIf death will do,â the King said, âlet me reign; You'll have, I'm sure, no reason to complain.â Martha Braymance. Life, n. A spiritual pickle preserving the body from decay. We live in daily apprehension of its loss; yet when lost it is not missed. The question, âIs life worth living?â has been much discussed; particularly by those who think it is not, many of whom have written at great length in support of their view and by careful observance of the laws of health enjoyed for long terms of years the honors of successful controversy. [âLife's not worth living, and that's the truth,â] âLife's not worth living, and that's the truth,â Carelessly caroled the golden youth. In manhood still he maintained that view And held it more strongly the older he grew. When kicked by a jackass at eighty-three, âGo fetch me a surgeon at once!â cried he. Han Soper. Limb, n. The branch of a tree or the leg of an American woman. ['Twas a pair of boots that the lady bought] 'Twas a pair of boots that the lady bought, And the salesman laced them tight To a very remarkable heightâ Higher, indeed, than I think he oughtâ Higher than can be right. For the Bible declaresâbut never mind: It is hardly fit To censure freely and fault to find With others for sins that I'm not inclined Myself to commit. Each has his weakness, and though my own Is freedom from every sin, It still were unfair to pitch in, Discharging the first censorious stone. Besides, the truth compels me to say, The boots in question were made that way. As he drew the lace she made a grimace, And blushingly said to him: âThis boot, I'm sure, is too high to endure, It hurts myâhurts myâlimb.â The salesman smiled in a manner mild, Like an artless, undesigning child; Then, checking himself, to his face he gave A look as sorrowful as the grave, Though he didn't care two figs For her pains and throes, As he stroked her toes, Remarking with speech and manner just Befitting his calling: âMadam, I trust That it doesn't hurt your twigs.â B. Percival Dike. Logomachy, n. A war in which the weapons are words and the wounds punctures in the swim-bladder of self-esteemâa kind of contest in which, the vanquished being unconscious of defeat, the victor is denied the reward of success. ['Tis said by divers of the scholar-men] 'Tis said by divers of the scholar-men That poor Salmasius died of Milton's pen. Alas! we cannot know if this is true, For reading Milton's wit we perish too. Lord, n. In American society, an English tourist above the state of a costermonger, as, Lord 'Aberdasher, Lord Hartisan and so forth. The traveling Briton of lesser degree is addressed as âSir,â as, Sir 'Arry Donkiboi, of 'Amstead 'Eath. The word âLordâ is sometimes used, also, as a title of the Supreme Being; but this is thought to be rather flattery than true reverence. [Miss Sallie Ann Splurge, of her own accord] Miss Sallie Ann Splurge, of her own accord, Wedded a wandering English lordâ Wedded and took him to dwell with her âpaw,â A parent who throve by the practice of Draw. Lord Cadde I don't hesitate here to declare Unworthy the father-in-legal care Of that elderly sport, notwithstanding the truth That Cadde had renounced all the follies of youth; For, sad to relate, he'd arrived at the stage Of existence that's marked by the vices of age. Among them, cupidity caused him to urge Repeated demands on the pocket of Splurge, Till, wrecked in his fortune, that gentleman saw Inadequate aid in the practice of Draw, And took, as a means of augmenting his pelf, To the business of being a lord himself. His neat-fitting garments he wilfully shed And sacked himself strangely in checks instead; Denuded his chin, but retained at each ear A whisker that looked like a blasted career. He painted his neck an incarnadine hue Each morning and varnished it all that he knew. The moony monocular set in his eye Appeared to be scanning the Sweet Bye-and-Bye. His head was enroofed with a billycock hat, And his low-necked shoes were aduncous and flat. In speech he eschewed his American ways, Denying his nose to the use of his A's And dulling their edge till the delicate sense Of a babe at their temper could take no offence. His H'sâ'twas most inexpressibly sweet, The patter they made as they fell at his feet! Re-outfitted thus, Mr. Splurge without fear Began as Lord Splurge his recouping career. Alas, the Divinity shaping his end Entertained other views and decided to send His lordship in horror, despair and dismay From the land of the nobleman's natural prey. For, smit with his Old World ways, Lady Cadde Fellâsuffering CÃ¦sar!âin love with her dad! G. J. Loss, n. Privation of that which we had, or had not. Thus, in the latter sense, it is said of a defeated candidate that he âlost his electionâ; and of that eminent man, the poet Gilder, that he has âlost his mind.â It is in the former and more legitimate sense, that the word is used in the famous epitaph: [Here Huntington's ashes long have lain] Here Huntington's ashes long have lain Whose loss is our own eternal gain, For while he exercised all his powers Whatever he gained, the loss was ours. Lyre, n. An ancient instrument of torture. The word is now used in a figurative sense to denote the poetic faculty, as in the following fiery lines of our great poet, Ella Wheeler Wilcox: [I sit astride Parnassus with my lyre] I sit astride Parnassus with my lyre, And pick with care the disobedient wire. The stupid shepherd lolling on his crook With deaf attention scarcely deigns to look. I bide my time, and it shall come at length, When, with a Titan's energy and strength, I'll grab a fistful of the strings, and O, The world shall suffer when I let them go! Farquharson Harris. M Machination, n. The method employed by one's opponents in baffling one's open and honorable efforts to do the right thing. [So plain the advantages of machination] So plain the advantages of machination It constitutes a moral obligation, And honest wolves who think upon't with loathing Feel bound to don the sheep's deceptive clothing. So prospers still the diplomatic art, And Satan bows, with hand upon his heart. R. S. K. Macrobian, n. One forgotten of the gods and living to a great age. History is abundantly supplied with examples, from Methuselah to Old Parr, but some notable instances of longevity are less well known. A Calabrian peasant named Coloni, born in 1753, lived so long that he had what he considered a glimpse of the dawn of universal peace. Scanavius relates that he knew an archbishop who was so old that he could remember a time when he did not deserve hanging. In 1566 a linen draper of Bristol, England, declared that he had lived five hundred years, and that in all that time he had never told a lie. There are instances of longevity (macrobiosis) in our own country. Senator Chauncey Depew is old enough to know better. The editor of The American, a newspaper in New York City, has a memory that goes back to the time when he was a rascal, but not to the fact. The President of the United States was born so long ago that many of the friends of his youth have risen to high political and military preferment without the assistance of personal merit. The verses following were written by a macrobian: [When I was young the world was fair] When I was young the world was fair And amiable and sunny. A brightness was in all the air, In all the waters, honey. The jokes were fine and funny, The statesmen honest in their views, And in their lives, as well, And when you heard a bit of news 'Twas true enough to tell. Men were not ranting, shouting, reeking, Nor women âgenerally speaking.â The Summer then was long indeed: It lasted one whole season! The sparkling Winter gave no heed When ordered by Unreason To bring the early peas on. Now, where the dickens is the sense In calling that a year Which does no more than just commence Before the end is near? When I was young the year extended From month to month until it ended. I know not why the world has changed To something dark and dreary, And everything is now arranged To make a fellow weary. The Weather ManâI fear he Has much to do with it, for, sure, The air is not the same: It chokes you when it is impure, When pure it makes you lame. With windows closed you are asthmatic; Open, neuralgic or sciatic. Well, I suppose this new rÃ©gime Of dun degeneration Seems eviler than it would seem To a better observation, And has for compensation Some blessings in a deep disguise Which mortal sight has failed To pierce, although to angels' eyes They're visibly unveiled. If Age is such a boon, good land! He's costumed by a master hand! Venable Strigg. Maiden, n. A young person of the unfair sex addicted to clewless conduct and views that madden to crime. The genus has a wide geographical distribution, being found wherever sought and deplored wherever found. The maiden is not altogether unpleasing to the eye, nor (without her piano and her views) insupportable to the ear, though in respect to comeliness distinctly inferior to the rainbow, and, with regard to the part of her that is audible, beaten out of the field by the canaryâwhich, also, is more portable. [A lovelorn maiden she sat and sang] A lovelorn maiden she sat and sangâ This quaint, sweet song sang she: âIt's O for a youth with a football bang And a muscle fair to see! The Captain he Of a team to be! On the gridiron he shall shine, A monarch by right divine, And never to roast on itâme!â Opoline Jones. Mammon, n. The god of the world's leading religion. His chief temple is in the holy city of New York. [He swore that all other religions were gammon] He swore that all other religions were gammon, And wore out his knees in the worship of Mammon. Jared Oopf. Man, n. An animal so lost in rapturous contemplation of what he thinks he is as to overlook what he indubitably ought to be. His chief occupation is extermination of other animals and his own species, which, however, multiplies with such insistent rapidity as to infest the whole habitable earth and Canada. [When the world was young and Man was new] When the world was young and Man was new, And everything was pleasant, Distinctions Nature never drew 'Mongst king and priest and peasant. We're not that way at present, Save here in this Republic, where We have that old rÃ©gime, For all are kings, however bare Their backs, howe'er extreme Their hunger. And, indeed, each has a voice To accept the tyrant of his party's choice. A citizen who would not vote, And, therefore, was detested, Was one day with a tarry coat (With feathers backed and breasted) By patriots invested. âIt is your duty,â cried the crowd, âYour ballot true to cast For the man o' your choice.â He humbly bowed, And explained his wicked past: âThat's what I very gladly would have done, Dear patriots, but he has never run.â Apperton Duke. Material, adj. Having an actual existence, as distinguished from an imaginary one. Important. [Material things I know, or feel, or see] Material things I know, or feel, or see; All else is immaterial to me. Jamarach Holobom. Meekness, n. Uncommon patience in planning a revenge that is worth while. [M is for Moses] M is for Moses, Who slew the Egyptian. As sweet as a rose is The meekness of Moses. No monument shows his Post-mortem inscription, But M is for Moses, Who slew the Egyptian. The Biographical Alphabet. Meerschaum, n. (Literally, seafoam, and by many erroneously supposed to be made of it.) A fine white clay, which for convenience in coloring it brown is made into tobacco pipes and smoked by the workmen engaged in that industry. The purpose of coloring it has not been disclosed by the manufacturers. [There was a youth you've heard before] There was a youth (you've heard before, This woful tale, may be), Who bought a meerschaum pipe and swore That color it would he! He shut himself from the world away, Nor any soul he saw. He smoked by night, he smoked by day, As hard as he could draw. His dog died moaning in the wrath Of winds that blew aloof; The weeds were in the gravel path, The owl was on the roof. âHe's gone afar, he'll come no more,â The neighbors sadly say. And so they batter in the door To take his goods away. Dead, pipe in mouth, the youngster lay, Nut-brown in face and limb. âThat pipe's a lovely white,â they say, âBut it has colored him!â The moral there's small need to singâ 'Tis plain as day to you: Don't play your game on any thing That is a gamester too. Martin Bulstrode. Misdemeanor, n. An infraction of the law having less dignity than a felony and constituting no claim to admittance into the best criminal society. [By misdemeanors he essayed to climb] By misdemeanors he essayed to climb Into the aristocracy of crime. O, woe was him!âwith manner chill and grand âCaptains of industryâ refused his hand, âKings of financeâ denied him recognition And ârailway magnatesâ jeered his low condition. He robbed a bank to make himself respected. They still rebuffed him, for he was detected. S. V. Hanipur. Monosyllabic, adj. Composed of words of one syllable, for literary babes who never tire of testifying their delight in the vapid compound by appropriate googoogling. The words are commonly Saxonâthat is to say, words of a barbarous people destitute of ideas and incapable of any but the most elementary sentiments and emotions. [The man who writes in Saxon] The man who writes in Saxon Is the man to use an ax on. Judibras. Monument, n. A structure intended to commemorate something which either needs no commemoration or cannot be commemorated. [The bones of Agamemnon are a show] The bones of Agamemnon are a show, And ruined is his royal monument, but Agamemnon's fame suffers no diminution in consequence. The monument custom has its reductiones ad absurdum in monuments âto the unknown deadââthat is to say, monuments to perpetuate the memory of those who have left no memory. Mummy, n. An ancient Egyptian, formerly in universal use among modern civilized nations as medicine, and now engaged in supplying art with an excellent pigment. He is handy, too, in museums in gratifying the vulgar curiosity that serves to distinguish man from the lower animals. [By means of the Mummy, mankind, it is said] By means of the Mummy, mankind, it is said, Attests to the gods its respect for the dead. We plunder his tomb, be he sinner or saint, Distil him for physic and grind him for paint, Exhibit for money his poor, shrunken frame, And with levity flock to the scene of the shame. O, tell me, ye gods, for the use of my rhyme: For respecting the dead what's the limit of time? Scopas Brune. N Nectar, n. A drink served at banquets of the Olympian deities. The secret of its preparation is lost, but the modern Kentuckians believe that they come pretty near to a knowledge of its chief ingredient. [Juno drank a cup of nectar] Juno drank a cup of nectar, But the draught did not affect her. Juno drank a cup of ryeâ Then she bade herself good-bye. J. G. Nose, n. The extreme outpost of the face. From the circumstance that great conquerors have great noses, Getius, whose writings antedate the age of humor, calls the nose the organ of quell. It has been observed that one's nose is never so happy as when thrust into the affairs of another, from which some physiologists have drawn the inference that the nose is devoid of the sense of smell. [There's a man with a Nose] There's a man with a Nose, And wherever he goes The people run from him and shout: âNo cotton have we For our ears if so be He blow that interminous snout!â So the lawyers applied For injunction. âDenied,â Said the Judge: âthe defendant prefixion, Whate'er it portend, Appears to transcend The bounds of this court's jurisdiction.â Arpad Singiny. O Old, adj. In that stage of usefulness which is not inconsistent with general inefficiency, as an old man. Discredited by lapse of time and offensive to the popular taste, as an old book. [âOld books? The devil take them!â Goby said] âOld books? The devil take them!â Goby said. âFresh every day must be my books and bread.â Nature herself approves the Goby rule And gives us every moment a fresh fool. Harley Shum. Olympian, adj. Relating to a mountain in Thessaly, once inhabited by gods, now a repository of yellowing newspapers, beer bottles and mutilated sardine cans, attesting the presence of the tourist and his appetite. [His name the smirking tourist scrawls] His name the smirking tourist scrawls Upon Minerva's temple walls, Where thundered once Olympian Zeus, And marks his appetite's abuse. Averil Joop. Opera, n. A play representing life in another world, whose inhabitants have no speech but song, no motions but gestures and no postures but attitudes. All acting is simulation, and the word simulation is from simia, an ape; but in opera the actor takes for his model Simia audibilis (or Pithecanthropos stentor)âthe ape that howls. [The actor apes a manâat least in shape] The actor apes a manâat least in shape; The opera performer apes an ape. Oppose, v. To assist with obstructions and objections. [How lonely he who thinks to vex] How lonely he who thinks to vex With badinage the Solemn Sex! Of levity, Mere Man, beware; None but the Grave deserve the Unfair. Percy P. Orminder. Orthography, n. The science of spelling by the eye instead of the ear. Advocated with more heat than light by the outmates of every asylum for the insane. They have had to concede a few things since the time of Chaucer, but are none the less hot in defence of those to be conceded hereafter. [A spelling reformer indicted] A spelling reformer indicted For fudge was before the court cicted. The judge said: âEnoughâ His candle we'll snough, And his sepulchre shall not be whicted.â Out-of-Doors, n. That part of one's environment upon which no government has been able to collect taxes. Chiefly useful to inspire poets. [I climbed to the top of a mountain one day] I climbed to the top of a mountain one day To see the sun setting in glory, And I thought, as I looked at his vanishing ray, Of a perfectly splendid story. 'Twas about an old man and the ass he bestrode Till the strength of the beast was o'ertested; Then the man would carry him miles on the road Till Neddy was pretty well rested. The moon rising solemnly over the crest Of the hills to the east of my station Displayed her broad disk to the darkening west Like a visible new creation. And I thought of a joke (and I laughed till I cried) Of an idle young woman who tarried About a church-door for a look at the bride, Although 'twas herself that was married. To poets all Nature is pregnant with grand Ideasâwith thought and emotion. I pity the dunces who don't understand The speech of earth, heaven and ocean. Stromboli Smith. Ovation, n. In ancient Rome, a definite, formal pageant in honor of one who had been disserviceable to the enemies of the nation. A lesser âtriumph.â In modern English the word is improperly used to signify any loose and spontaneous expression of popular homage to the hero of the hour and place. [âI had an ovation!â the actor man said] âI had an ovation!â the actor man said, But I thought it uncommonly queer, That people and critics by him had been led By the ear. The Latin lexicon makes his absurd Assertion as plain as a peg; In âovumâ we find the true root of the word. It means egg. Dudley Spink. Overeat, v. To dine. [Hail, Gastronome, Apostle of Excess] Hail, Gastronome, Apostle of Excess, Well skilled to overeat without distress! Thy great invention, the unfatal feast, Shows Man's superiority to Beast. John Boop. P Peace, n. In international affairs, a period of cheating between two periods of fighting. [O, what's the loud uproar assailing] O, what's the loud uproar assailing Mine ears without cease? 'Tis the voice of the hopeful, all-hailing The horrors of peace. Ah, Peace Universal; they woo itâ Would marry it, too. If only they knew how to do it 'Twere easy to do. They're working by night and by day On their problem, like moles. Have mercy, O Heaven, I pray, On their meddlesome souls! Ro Amil. Perseverance, n. A lowly virtue whereby mediocrity achieves an inglorious success. [âPersevere, persevere!â cry the homilists all] âPersevere, persevere!â cry the homilists all, Themselves, day and night, persevering to bawl. âRemember the fable of tortoise and hareâ The one at the goal while the other isâwhere?â Why, back there in Dreamland, renewing his lease Of life, all his muscles preserving the peace, The goal and the rival forgotten alike, And the long fatigue of the needless hike. His spirit a-squat in the grass and the dew Of the dogless Land beyond the Stew, He sleeps, like a saint in a holy place, A winner of all that is good in a race. Sukker Uffro. Physiognomy, n. The art of determining the character of another by the resemblances and differences between his face and our own, which is the standard of excellence. [âThere is no art,â says Shakspeare, foolish man] âThere is no art,â says Shakspeare, foolish man, âTo read the mind's construction in the face.â The physiognomists his portrait scan, And say: âHow little wisdom here we trace! He knew his face disclosed his mind and heart, So, in his own defence, denied our art.â Lavatar Shunk. Picture, n. A representation in two dimensions of something wearisome in three. [Behold great Daubert's picture here on view] âBehold great Daubert's picture here on viewâ Taken from Life.â If that description's true, Grant, heavenly Powers, that I be taken, too. Jali Hane. Pie, n. An advance agent of the reaper whose name is Indigestion. Cold pie was highly esteemed by the remains.â The Rev. Dr. Mucker, in a Funeral Sermon Over a British Nobleman.

Anteprandial. [Precipitate in all, this sinner] Precipitate in all, this sinner Took action first, and then his dinner. Judibras. Prehistoric, adj. Belonging to an early period and a museum. Antedating the art and practice of perpetuating falsehood. [He lived in a period prehistoric] He lived in a period prehistoric, When all was absurd and phantasmagoric. Born later, when Clio, celestial recorder, Set down great events in succession and order, He surely had seen nothing droll or fortuitous In anything here but the lies that she threw at us. Orpheus Bowen. Preside, v. To guide the action of a deliberative body to a desirable result. In Journalese, to perform upon a musical instrument; as, âHe presided at the piccolo.â [The Headliner, holding the copy in hand] The Headliner, holding the copy in hand, Read with a solemn face: âThe music was very uncommonly grandâ The best that was every provided, For our townsman Brown presided At the organ with skill and grace.â The Headliner discontinued to read, And, spreading the paper down On the desk, he dashed in at the top of the screed: âGreat playing by President Brown.â Orpheus Bowen. President, n. The leading figure in a small group of men of whomâand of whom onlyâit is positively known that immense numbers of their countrymen did not want any of them for President. [If that's an honor surely 'tis a greater] If that's an honor surely 'tis a greater To have been a simple and undamned spectator. Behold in me a man of mark and note Whom no elector e'er denied a vote!â An undiscredited, unhooted gent Who might, for all we know, be President By acclamation. Cheer, ye varlets, cheerâ I'm passing with a wide and open ear! Jonathan Fomry. Prison, n. A place of punishments and rewards. The poet assures us thatâ [âStone walls do not a prison make,â] âStone walls do not a prison make,â but a combination of the stone wall, the political parasite and the moral instructor is no garden of sweets. Prospect, n. An outlook, usually forbidding. An expectation, usually forbidden. [Blow, blow, ye spicy breezes] Blow, blow, ye spicy breezesâ O'er Ceylon blow your breath, Where every prospect pleases, Save only that of death. Bishop Sheber. Q Quiver, n.

Oglum P. Boomp. Quixotic, adj. Absurdly chivalric, like Don Quixote. An insight into the beauty and excellence of this incomparable adjective is unhappily denied to him who has the misfortune to know that the gentleman's name is pronounced Ke-ho-tay.

The act of repeating erroneously the words of another. The words erroneously repeated.

[This is a truth, as old as the hills] This is a truth, as old as the hills, That life and experience teach: The poor man suffers that keenest of ills, An impediment in his reach. G. J. Reading, n. The general body of what one reads. In our country it consists, as a rule, of Indiana novels, short stories in âdialectâ and humor in slang.

The doctrine of Redemption is the fundamental mystery of our holy religion, and whoso believeth in it shall not perish, but have everlasting life in which to try to understand it. [We must awake Man's spirit from its sin] We must awake Man's spirit from its sin, And take some special measure for redeeming it; Though hard indeed the task to get it in Among the angels any way but teaming it, Or purify it otherwise than steaming it.

Sometimes it is conferred by an unfriendly and inconsiderate hand. [I touched the harp in every key] I touched the harp in every key, But found no heeding ear; And then Ithuriel touched me With a revealing spear. Not all my genius, great as 'tis, Could urge me out of night. I felt the faint appulse of his, And leapt into the light! W. J. Candleton. Repentance, n.

Joel Spate Woop. Responsibility, n. A detachable burden easily shifted to the shoulders of God, Fate, Fortune, Luck or one's neighbor. In the days of astrology it was customary to unload it upon a star. [Alas, things ain't what we should see] Alas, things ain't what we should see If Eve had let that apple be; And many a feller which had ought To set with monarchses of thought, Or play some rosy little game With battle-chaps on fields of fame, Is downed by his unlucky star, And hollers: âPeanuts!âhere you are!â âThe Sturdy Beggar.â Retribution, n. A rain of fire-and-brimstone that falls alike upon the just and such of the unjust as have not procured shelter by evicting them. In the lines following, addressed to an Emperor in exile by Father Gassalasca Jape, the reverend poet appears to hint his sense of the imprudence of turning about to face Retribution when it is taking exercise: [What, what! Dom Pedro, you desire to go] What, what! Dom Pedro, you desire to go Back to Brazil to end your days in quiet? Why, what assurance have you 'twould be so? 'Tis not so long since you were in a riot, And your dear subjects showed a will to fly at Your throat and shake you like a rat.

[To set your wisdom holding not a doubt of it] To set your wisdom (holding not a doubt of it, Although in truth there's neither bone nor skin to it) At work upon a book, and so read out of it The qualities that you have first read into it. Right, n. Legitimate authority to be, to do or to have; as the right to be a king, the right to do one's neighbor, the right to have measles, and the like. The first of these rights was once universally believed to be derived directly from the will of God; and this is still sometimes affirmed in partibus infidelium outside the enlightened realms of Democracy; as the well known lines of Sir Abednego Bink, following: [By what right, then, do royal rulers rule?] By what right, then, do royal rulers rule? Whose is the sanction of their state and pow'r? He surely were as stubborn as a mule Who, God unwilling, could maintain an hour His uninvited session on the throne, or air His pride securely in the Presidential chair. Whatever is is so by Right Divine; Whate'er occurs, God wills it so. Good land! It were a wondrous thing if His design A fool could baffle or a rogue withstand! If so, then God, I say (intending no offence) Is guilty of contributory negligence. Rimer, n. A poet regarded with indifference or disesteem. [The rimer quenches his unheeded fires] The rimer quenches his unheeded fires, The sound surceases and the sense expires.

A strip of land along which one may pass from where it is too tiresome to be to where it is futile to go. [All roads, howsoe'er they diverge, lead to Rome] All roads, howsoe'er they diverge, lead to Rome, Whence, thank the good Lord, at least one leads back home. Borey the Bald. Rumor, n. A favorite weapon of the assassins of character. [Sharp, irresistible by mail or shield] Sharp, irresistible by mail or shield, By guard unparried as by flight unstayed, O serviceable Rumor, let me wield Against my enemy no other blade. His be the terror of a foe unseen, His the inutile hand upon the hilt, And mine the deadly tongue, long, slender, keen, Hinting a rumor of some ancient guilt. So shall I slay the wretch without a blow, Spare me to celebrate his overthrow, And nurse my valor for another foe. Joel Buxter. S Sabbath, n. A weekly festival having its origin in the fact that God made the world in six days and was arrested on the seventh. Among the Jews observance of the day was enforced by a Commandment of which this is the Christian version: âRemember the seventh day to make thy neighbor keep it wholly.â To the Creator it seemed fit and expedient that the Sabbath should be the last day of the week, but the Early Fathers of the Church held other views. So great is the sanctity of the day that even where the Lord holds a doubtful and precarious jurisdiction over those who go down to (and down into) the sea it is reverently recognized, as is manifest in the following deep-water version of the Fourth Commandment: [Six days shalt thou labor and do all thou art able] Six days shalt thou labor and do all thou art able, And on the seventh holystone the deck and scrape the cable. Decks are no longer holystoned, but the cable still supplies the captain with opportunity to attest a pious respect for the divine ordinance. Sacred, adj. Dedicated to some religious purpose; having a divine character; inspiring solemn thoughts or emotions; as, the Dalai Lama of Thibet; the Moogum of M'bwango; the temple of Apes in Ceylon; the Cow in India; the Crocodile, the Cat and the Onion of ancient Egypt; the Mufti of Moosh; the hair of the dog that bit Noah, etc. [All things are either sacred or profane] All things are either sacred or profane. The former to ecclesiasts bring gain; The latter to the devil appertain. Dumbo Omohundro. Safety-Clutch, n. A mechanical device acting automatically to prevent the fall of an elevator, or cage, in case of an accident to the hoisting apparatus. [Once I seen a human ruin] Once I seen a human ruin In a elevator-well, And his members was bestrewin' All the place where he had fell. And I says, apostrophisin' That uncommon woful wreck: âYour position's so surprisin' That I tremble for your neck!â Then that ruin, smilin' sadly And impressive, up and spoke: âWell, I wouldn't tremble badly, For it's been a fortnight broke.â Then, for further comprehension Of his attitude, he begs I will focus my attention On his various arms and legsâ How they all are contumacious; Where they each, respective, lie; How one trotter proves ungracious, T'other one an alibi. These particulars is mentioned For to show his dismal state, Which I wasn't first intentioned To specifical relate. None is worser to be dreaded That I ever have heard tell Than the gent's who there was spreaded In that elevator-well. Now this tale is allegoricâ It is figurative all, For the well is metaphoric And the feller didn't fall. I opine it isn't moral For a writer-man to cheat, And despise to wear a laurel As was gotten by deceit. For 'tis Politics intended By the elevator, mind, It will boost a person splendid If his talent is the kind. Col. Bryan had the talent (For the busted man is him) And it shot him up right gallant Till his head begun to swim. Then the rope it broke above him And he painful come to earth Where there's nobody to love him For his detrimented worth. Though he's livin' none would know him, Or at leastwise not as such. Moral of this woful poem: Frequent oil your safety-clutch. Porfer Poog. Satire, n. An obsolete kind of literary composition in which the vices and follies of the author's enemies were expounded with imperfect tenderness. In this country satire never had more than a sickly and uncertain existence, for the soul of it is wit, wherein we are dolefully deficient, the humor that we mistake for it, like all humor, being tolerant and sympathetic. Moreover, although Americans are âendowed by their Creatorâ with abundant vice and folly, it is not generally known that these are reprehensible qualities, wherefore the satirist is popularly regarded as a sour-spirited knave, and his every victim's outcry for codefendants evokes a national assent. [Hail Satire! be thy praises ever sung] Hail Satire! be thy praises ever sung In the dead language of a mummy's tongue, For thou thyself art dead, and damned as wellâ Thy spirit (usefully employed) in Hell. Had it been such as consecrates the Bible Thou hadst not perished by the law of libel. Barney Stims. Scarabee, n. The same as scarabÃ¦us. [He fell by his own hand] He fell by his own hand Beneath the great oak tree. He'd traveled in a foreign land. He tried to make her understand The dance that's called the Saraband, But he called it Scarabee. He had called it so through an afternoon, And she, the light of his harem if so might be, Had smiled and said naught. O the body was fair to see, All frosted there in the shine o' the moonâ Dead for a Scarabee And a recollection that came too late. O Fate! They buried him where he lay, He sleeps awaiting the Day, In state, And two Possible Puns, moon-eyed and wan, Gloom over the grave and then move on. Dead for a Scarabee! Fernando Tapple. Scrap-Book, n. A book that is commonly edited by a fool. Many persons of some small distinction compile scrap-books containing whatever they happen to read about themselves or employ others to collect. One of these egotists was addressed in the lines following, by Agamemnon Melancthon Peters: [Dear Frank, that scrap-book where you boast] Dear Frank, that scrap-book where you boast You keep a record true Of every kind of peppered roast That's made of you; Wherein you paste the printed gibes That revel round your name, Thinking the laughter of the scribes Attests your fame; Where all the pictures you arrange That comic pencils traceâ Your funny figure and your strange Semitic faceâ Pray lend it me. Wit I have not, Nor art, but there I'll list The daily drubbings you'd have got Had God a fist. Seine, n. A kind of net for effecting an involuntary change of environment. For fish it is made strong and coarse, but women are more easily taken with a singularly delicate fabric weighted with small, cut stones. [The devil casting a seine of lace] The devil casting a seine of lace, (With precious stones 'twas weighted) Drew it into the landing place And its contents calculated. All souls of women were in that sackâ A draft miraculous, precious! But ere he could throw it across his back They'd all escaped through the meshes. Baruch de Loppis. Severalty, n. Separateness, as, lands in severalty, i. e., lands held individually, not in joint ownership. Certain tribes of Indians are believed now to be sufficiently civilized to have in severalty the lands that they have hitherto held as tribal organizations, and could not sell to the Whites for waxen beads and potato whiskey. [Lo! the poor Indian whose unsuited mind] Lo! the poor Indian whose unsuited mind Saw death before, hell and the grave behind; Whom thrifty settlers ne'er besought to stayâ His small belongings their appointed prey; Whom Dispossession, with alluring wile, Persuaded elsewhere every little while! His fire unquenched and his undying worm By âland in severaltyâ (charming term!) Are cooled and killed, respectively, at last, And he to his new holding anchored fast! Sheriff, n. In America the chief executive officer of a county, whose most characteristic duties, in some of the Western and Southern States, are the catching and hanging of rogues. [John Elmer Pettibone Cajee] John Elmer Pettibone Cajee (I write of him with little glee) Was just as bad as he could be. 'Twas frequently remarked: âI swon! The sun has never looked upon So bad a man as Neighbor John.â A sinner through and through, he had This added fault: it made him mad To know another man was bad. In such a case he thought it right To rise at any hour of night And quench that wicked person's light. Despite the town's entreaties, he Would hale him to the nearest tree And leave him swinging wide and free. Or sometimes, if the humor came, A luckless wight's reluctant frame Was given to the cheerful flame. While it was turning nice and brown, All unconcerned John met the frown Of that austere and righteous town. âHow sad,â his neighbors said, âthat he So scornful of the law should beâ An anar c, h, i, s, t.â (That is the way that they preferred To utter the abhorrent word, So strong the aversion that it stirred.) âResolved,â they said, continuing, âThat Badman John must cease this thing Of having his unlawful fling. âNow, by these sacred relicsââhere Each man had out a souvenir Got at a lynching yesteryearâ âBy these we swear he shall forsake His ways, nor cause our hearts to ache By sins of rope and torch and stake. âWe'll tie his red right hand until He'll have small freedom to fulfil The mandates of his lawless will.â So, in convention then and there, They named him Sheriff. The affair Was opened, it is said, with prayer. J. Milton Sloluck. Smithareen, n. A fragment, a decomponent part, a remain. The word is used variously, but in the following verses on a noted female reformer who opposed bicycle-riding by women because it âled them to the devilâ it is seen at its best: [The wheels go round without a sound] The wheels go round without a soundâ The maidens hold high revel; In sinful mood, insanely gay, True spinsters spin adown the way From duty to the devil! They laugh, they sing, andâting-a-ling! Their bells go all the morning; Their lanterns bright bestar the night Pedestrians a-warning. With lifted hands Miss Charlotte stands, Good-Lording and O-mying, Her rheumatism forgotten quite, Her fat with anger frying. She blocks the path that leads to wrath, Jack Satan's power defying. The wheels go round without a sound The lights burn red and blue and green. What's this that's found upon the ground? Poor Charlotte Smith's a smithareen! John William Yope. Sophistry, n. The controversial method of an opponent, distinguished from one's own by superior insincerity and fooling. This method is that of the later Sophists, a Grecian sect of philosophers who began by teaching wisdom, prudence, science, art and, in brief, whatever men ought to know, but lost themselves in a maze of quibbles and a fog of words. [His bad opponent's âfactsâ he sweeps away] His bad opponent's âfactsâ he sweeps away, And drags his sophistry to light of day; Then swears they're pushed to madness who resort To falsehood of so desperate a sort. Not so; like sods upon a dead man's breast, He lies most lightly who the least is pressed. Polydore Smith. Success, n. The one unpardonable sin against one's fellows. In literature, and particularly in poetry, the elements of success are exceedingly simple, and are admirably set forth in the following lines by the reverend Father Gassilasca Jape, entitled, for some mysterious reason, âJohn A. Joyce.â [The bard who would prosper must carry a book] The bard who would prosper must carry a book, Do his thinking in prose and wear A crimson cravat, a far-away look And a head of hexameter hair. Be thin in your thought and your body'll be fat; If you wear your hair long you needn't your hat. Sycophant, n. One who approaches Greatness on his belly so that he may not be commanded to turn and be kicked. He is sometimes an editor. [As the lean leech, its victim found, is pleased] As the lean leech, its victim found, is pleased To fix itself upon a part diseased Till, its black hide distended with bad blood, It drops to die of surfeit in the mud, So the base sycophant with joy descries His neighbor's weak spot and his mouth applies, Gorges and prospers like the leech, although, Unlike that reptile, he will not let go. Gelasma, if it paid you to devote Your talent to the service of a goat, Showing by forceful logic that its beard Is more than Aaron's fit to be revered; If to the task of honoring its smell Profit had prompted you, and love as well, The world would benefit at last by you And wealthy malefactors weep anewâ Your favor for a moment's space denied And to the nobler object turned aside. Is't not enough that thrifty millionaires Who loot in freight and spoliate in fares, Or, cursed with consciences that bid them fly To safer villainies of darker dye, Forswearing robbery and fain, instead, To steal (they call it âcorneringâ) our bread May see you groveling their boots to lick And begging for the favor of a kick? Still must you follow to the bitter end Your sycophantic disposition's trend, And in your eagerness to please the rich Hunt hungry sinners to their final ditch? In Morgan's praise you smite the sounding wire, And sing hosannas to great Havemeyer! What's Satan done that him you should eschew? He too is reeking richâdeducting you. Symbolic, adj. Pertaining to symbols and the use and interpretation of symbols. [They say 'tis conscience feels compunction] They say 'tis conscience feels compunction; I hold that that's the stomach's function, For of the sinner I have noted That when he's sinned he's somewhat bloated, Or ill some other ghastly fashion Within that bowel of compassion. True, I believe the only sinner Is he that eats a shabby dinner. You know how Adam with good reason, For eating apples out of season, Was âcursed.â But that is all symbolic: The truth is, Adam had the colic. G. J. T Table d' HÃTE, n. A caterer's thrifty concession to the universal passion for irresponsibility. [Old Paunchinello, freshly wed] Old Paunchinello, freshly wed, Took Madame P. to table, And there deliriously fed As fast as he was able. âI dote upon good grub,â he cried, Intent upon its throatage. âAh, yes,â said the neglected bride, âYou're in your table d'hÃ´tage.â Associated Poets. Tariff, n. A scale of taxes on imports, designed to protect the domestic producer against the greed of his consumer. [The Enemy of Human Souls] The Enemy of Human Souls Sat grieving at the cost of coals; For Hell had been annexed of late, And was a sovereign Southern State. âIt were no more than right,â said he, âThat I should get my fuel free. The duty, neither just nor wise, Compels me to economizeâ Whereby my broilers, every one, Are execrably underdone. What would they have?âalthough I yearn To do them nicely to a turn, I can't afford an honest heat. This tariff makes even devils cheat! I'm ruined, and my humble trade All rascals may at will invade: Beneath my nose the public press Outdoes me in sulphureousness; The bar ingeniously applies To my undoing my own lies; My medicines the doctors use (Albeit vainly) to refuse To me my fair and rightful prey And keep their own in shape to pay; The preachers by example teach What, scorning to perform, I preach; And statesmen, aping me, all make More promises than they can break. Against such competition I Lift up a disregarded cry. Since all ignore my just complaint, By Hokey-Pokey! I'll turn saint!â Now, the Republicans, who all Are saints, began at once to baw] Against his competition; so There was a devil of a go! They locked horns with him, tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte In acrimonious debate, Till Democrats, forlorn and lone, Had hopes of coming by their own. That evil to avert, in haste The two belligerents embraced; But since 'twere wicked to relax A tittle of the Sacred Tax, 'Twas finally agreed to grant The bold Insurgent-protestant A bounty on each soul that fell Into his ineffectual Hell. Edam Smith. Tenacity, n. A certain quality of the human hand in its relation to the coin of the realm. It attains its highest development in the hand of authority and is considered a serviceable equipment for a career in politics. The following illustrative lines were written of a Californian gentleman in high political preferment, who has passed to his accounting: [Of such tenacity his grip] Of such tenacity his grip That nothing from his hand can slip. Well-buttered eels you may o'erwhelm In tubs of liquid slippery-elm In vainâfrom his detaining pinch They cannot struggle half an inch! 'Tis lucky that he so is planned That breath he draws not with his hand, For if he did, so great his greed He'd draw his last with eager speed. Nay, that were well, you say. Not so He'd draw but never let it go! Tortoise, n. A creature thoughtfully created to supply occasion for the following lines by the illustrious Ambat Delaso: TO MY PET TORTOISE My friend, you are not gracefulânot at all; Your gait's between a stagger and a sprawl. Nor are you beautiful: your head's a snake's To look at, and I do not doubt it aches. As to your feet, they'd make an angel weep. 'Tis true you take them in whene'er you sleep. No, you're not pretty, but you have, I own, A certain firmnessâmostly you're backbone. Firmness and strength (you have a giant's thews) Are virtues that the great know how to useâ I wish that they did not; yet, on the whole, You lackâexcuse my mentioning itâSoul. So, to be candid, unreserved and true, I'd rather you were I than I were you. Perhaps, however, in a time to be, When Man's extinct, a better world may see Your progeny in power and control, Due to the genesis and growth of Soul. So I salute you as a reptile grand Predestined to regenerate the land. Father of Possibilities, O deign To accept the homage of a dying reign! In the far region of the unforeknown I dream a tortoise upon every throne. I see an Emperor his head withdraw Into his carapace for fear of Law; A King who carries something else than fat, Howe'er acceptably he carries that; A President not strenuously bent On punishment of audible dissentâ Who never shot (it were a vain attack) An armed or unarmed tortoise in the back; Subjects and citizens that feel no need To make the March of Mind a wild stampede; All progress slow, contemplative, sedate, And âTake your timeâ the word, in Church and State. O Tortoise, 'tis a happy, happy dream, My glorious testudinous rÃ©gime! I wish in Eden you'd brought this about By slouching in and chasing Adam out. U Understanding, n. A cerebral secretion that enables one having it to know a house from a horse by the roof on the house. Its nature and laws have been exhaustively expounded by Locke, who rode a house, and Kant, who lived in a horse. [His understanding was so keen] His understanding was so keen That all things which he'd felt, heard, seen, He could interpret without fail If he was in or out of jail. He wrote at Inspiration's call Deep disquisitions on them all, Then, pent at last in an asylum, Performed the service to compile 'em. So great a writer, all men swore, They never had not read before. Jorrock Wormley. Urbanity, n. The kind of civility that urban observers ascribe to dwellers in all cities but New York. Its commonest expression is heard in the words, âI beg your pardon,â and it is not inconsistent with disregard of the rights of others. [The owner of a powder mill] The owner of a powder mill Was musing on a distant hillâ Something his mind forebodedâ When from the cloudless sky there fell A deviled human kidney! Well, The man's mill had exploded. His hat he lifted from his head; âI beg your pardon, sir,â he said; âI didn't know 'twas loaded.â Swatkin. V Vanity, n. The tribute of a fool to the worth of the nearest ass. [They say that hens do cackle loudest when] They say that hens do cackle loudest when There's nothing vital in the eggs they've laid; And there are hens, professing to have made A study of mankind, who say that men Whose business 'tis to drive the tongue or pen Make the most clamorous fanfaronade O'er their most worthless work; and I'm afraid They're not entirely different from the hen. Lo! the drum-major in his coat of gold, His blazing breeches and high-towering capâ Imperiously pompous, grandly bold, Grim, resolute, an awe-inspiring chap! Who'd think this gorgeous creature's only virtue Is that in battle he will never hurt you? Hannibal Hunsiker. W Wall Street, n. A symbol of sin for every devil to rebuke. That Wall Street is a den of thieves is a belief that serves every unsuccessful thief in place of a hope in Heaven. Even the great and good Andrew Carnegie has made his profession of faith in the matter. [Carnegie the dauntless has uttered his call] Carnegie the dauntless has uttered his call To battle: âThe brokers are parasites all!â Carnegie, Carnegie, you'll never prevail; Keep the wind of your slogan to belly your sail, Go back to your isle of perpetual brume, Silence your pibroch, doff tartan and plume: Ben Lomond is calling his son from the frayâ Fly, fly from the region of Wall Street away! While still you're possessed of a single baubee (I wish it were pledged to endowment of me) 'Twere wise to retreat from the wars of finance Lest its value decline ere your credit advance. For a man 'twixt a king of finance and the sea, Carnegie, Carnegie, your tongue is too free! Anonymus Bink. Washingtonian, n. A Potomac tribesman who exchanged the privilege of governing himself for the advantage of good government. In justice to him it should be said that he did not want to. [They took away his vote and gave instead] They took away his vote and gave instead The right, when he had earned, to eat his bread. In vainâhe clamors for his âboss,â poor soul, To come again and part him from his roll. Offenbach Stutz. Weather, n. The climate of an hour. A permanent topic of conversation among persons whom it does not interest, but who have inherited the tendency to chatter about it from naked arboreal ancestors whom it keenly concerned. The setting up of official weather bureaus and their maintenance in mendacity prove that even governments are accessible to suasion by the rude forefathers of the jungle. [Once I dipt into the future far as human eye could see] Once I dipt into the future far as human eye could see, And I saw the Chief Forecaster, dead as any one can beâ Dead and damned and shut in Hades as a liar from his birth, With a record of unreason seldom paralleled on earth. While I looked he reared him solemnly, that incandescent youth, From the coals that he'd preferred to the advantages of truth. He cast his eyes about him and above him; then he wrote On a slab of thin asbestos what I venture here to quoteâ For I read it in the rose-light of the everlasting glow: âCloudy; variable winds, with local showers; cooler; snow.â Halcyon Jones. Whangdepootenawah, n. In the Ojibwa tongue, disaster; an unexpected affliction that strikes hard. [Should you ask me whence this laughter] Should you ask me whence this laughter, Whence this audible big-smiling, With its labial extension, With its maxillar distortion And its diaphragmic rhythmus Like the billowing of ocean, Like the shaking of a carpet, I should answer, I should tell you: From the great deeps of the spirit, From the unplummeted abysmus Of the soul this laughter welleth As the fountain, the gug-guggle, Like the river from the caÃ±on, To entoken and give warning That my present mood is sunny. Should you ask me further questionâ Why the great deeps of the spirit, Why the unplummeted abysmus Of the soul extrudes this laughter, This all audible big-smiling, I should answer, I should tell you With a white heart, tumpitumpy, With a true tongue, honest Injun: William Bryan, he has Caught It, Caught the Whangdepootenawah! Is't the sandhill crane, the shankank, Standing in the marsh, the kneedeep, Standing silent in the kneedeep With his wing-tips crossed behind him And his neck close-reefed before him, With his bill, his william, buried In the down upon his bosom, With his head retracted inly, While his shoulders overlook it? Does the sandhill crane, the shankank, Shiver grayly in the north wind, Wishing he had died when little, As the sparrow, the chipchip, does? No 'tis not the Shankank standing, Standing in the gray and dismal Marsh, the gray and dismal kneedeep. No, 'tis peerless William Bryan Realizing that he's Caught It, Caught the Whangdepootenawah! Worms'-meat, n. The finished product of which we are the raw material. The contents of the Taj Mahal, the Tombeau Napoleon and the Grantarium. Worm's-meat is usually outlasted by the structure that houses it, but âthis too must pass away.â Probably the silliest work in which a human being can engage is construction of a tomb for himself. The solemn purpose cannot dignify, but only accentuates by contrast the foreknown futility. [Ambitious fool! so mad to be a show!] Ambitious fool! so mad to be a show! How profitless the labor you bestow Upon a dwelling whose magnificence The tenant neither can admire nor know. Build deep, build high, build massive as you can, The wanton grass-roots will defeat the plan By shouldering asunder all the stones In what to you would be a moment's span. Time to the dead so all unreckoned flies That when your marble all is dust, arise, If wakened, stretch your limbs and yawnâ You'll think you scarcely can have closed your eyes. What though of all man's works your tomb alone Should stand till Time himself be overthrown? Would it advantage you to dwell therein Forever as a stain upon a stone? Joel Huck. Y Yesterday, n. The infancy of youth, the youth of manhood, the entire past of age. [But yesterday I should have thought me blest] But yesterday I should have thought me blest To stand high-pinnacled upon the peak Of middle life and look adown the bleak And unfamiliar foreslope to the West, Where solemn shadows all the land invest And stilly voices, half-remembered, speak Unfinished prophecy, and witch-fires freak The haunted twilight of the Dark of Rest. Yea, yesterday my soul was all aflame To stay the shadow on the dial's face At manhood's noonmark! Now, in God His name I chide aloud the little interspace Disparting me from Certitude, and fain Would know the dream and vision ne'er again. Baruch Arnegriff. It is said that in his last illness the poet Arnegriff was attended at different times by seven doctors. Z Zeal, n. A certain nervous disorder afflicting the young and inexperienced. A passion that goeth before a sprawl. [When Zeal sought Gratitude for his reward] When Zeal sought Gratitude for his reward He went away exclaiming: âO my Lord!â âWhat do you want?â the Lord asked, bending down. âAn ointment for my cracked and bleeding crown.â Jum Coople. Zigzag, v. t. To move forward uncertainly, from side to side, as one carrying the white man's burden. (From zed, z, and jag, an Icelandic word of unknown meaning.) [He zedjagged so uncomen wyde] He zedjagged so uncomen wyde Thet non coude pas on eyder syde; So, to com saufly thruh, I been Constreynet for to doodge betwene. Munwele.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME VI THE SLEEPING LION A Bull, the angel of the wild, A Bull as gentle as a child, A pleasant mannered Bull that lay Upon a hill at break of day And munched his cud, observed a gleam Of crimson on the world's extreme Where the Dawn-Spirit had released His flaring banner in the east. The Bull, a flame in either eye That frightened the offending sky, Rose, pawed the earth until his skin Was dun with dust from tail to chin, And lowering his horrid brows, Roared out: âHow dare you thus arouse The sleeping lion in my breast!â Then, like a storm from out the west, He blindly charged, and without check, Went o'er a cliff and broke his neck! A Tiger, calm, serene, sedate, Administered on his estate, And as he turned him into chyle Remarked with a contented smile: âThat sleeping lion in his breast Was just an ass that needed rest.â IN DOGLAND A Man who fared along a road That passed a yellow Dog's abode Incurred a paralyzing bite From that incarnate appetite, Creation's joy and hope and crownâ The pride and terror of the town! The Man in anger went before The nearest Magistrate and swore A warrant out for the Dog's Master, As author of the dire disaster. Haled into court, that citizen Employed attorneys, eight or ten, Who as one man arose, and O, The kind of things they said were so! All honest souls, a crowd immense, Were witnesses for the defense, And when they came to testify Of that bad plaintiffâmy, O my! Defendant rose and gravely swore The Dog had never bit before. âHow could I know, till he transgressed, The serpent lurking in his breast?â And all the people cried: âThat's so! How could he know? How could he know?â That wonâDefendant left the place On shoulders of the populace. The miserable Plaintiff slunk Away and soon was dead or drunk, Tradition says not which; I think Death is inferior to drink. But that's irrelevant: what now Concerns us is the bow and wow Made by the snapdogs of that region (Their name, tradition says, was Legion) When, with a sound of trumpets blown, The great decision was made known From Sweetpotatoville to Pone. They said, the dogs did, that the law Was goodâpro bonos mores (Latin That dogs and lawyers mostly chat in). They said, the while their bosoms burned With ardor, that their souls discerned âThe dawn of a new era,â which They promptly âhailedâ at concert pitch! As dogs had now the legal right To trouble Man for one free bite 'Twas voted that they would. They did: That land, from Glorypool to Squid, With snarl and yelp and snap of teeth (Flashing like falchions from the sheath) Was vocal till each cur beneath The sun had fleshed his maiden fang In some one of the human gang! True, all the dogs whose heads were frosted With age had long before exhausted Their lawful privilege, and these Died of chagrin among their fleas; But there were pups enough at heel Of every human leg to deal Out floods of hydrophobia's sap And wash that country from the map. A PAIR OF OPPOSITES A Fabulist of wide repute, Whose laugh was loud and wit was muteâ Whose grammar had the grace of guess, And language an initial Sâ Whose tireless efforts, long sustained, Proved him far better brawned than brained, Once met a Toad. âMy son,â said he, â'Twould jar you to get onto me! You're swell, but I'm the dandy guy That slings the gilt-edged lullaby. Dost tumble? What I'm shouting, see, Is, you're the antithesis of Me.â âThat compliment,â the Toad replied, âIs grateful to my foolish pride: It seems to mean that though I hop Right awkwardly I sometimes stop.â The gods, whom long the Fabulist Had plagued (the Toad had only hissed) Emitted loud Olympian snorts Of joy to hear the King of Warts Administer a mental pang To the Protagonist of Slang. So Jove appointed him to be Chief Jester by divine decree, And ne'er another joke made he. THE DEGENERATE Two Horses that had always chewed The bitter grain of servitudeâ Between their meals had ever felt The bit in mouth and lash on peltâ Once, as they drew the creaking wain, Saw a wild Zebra of the plain, Unknown to halter, stall or cage. Cried one: âGood Lord! this is an age Of miracle!â âNot so,â said t'other, âThat vision is a horse-and-brother. Degraded as he is by sin, He has an equine soul within, Albeit Law, with stern reproof, Has laid on him the heavy hoof. Those stripes but show he's âserving timeâ In punishment of some great crime.â The other thought an hour's span, Then said: âPerhaps he stole a man.â THE VAIN CAT Remarked a Tortoise to a Cat: âYour speed's a thing to marvel at! I saw you as you flitted by, And wished I were one-half so spry.â The Cat said, humbly: âWhy, indeed I was not showing then my speedâ That was a poor performance.â Then She said exultantly (as when The condor feels his bosom thrill Remembering Chimborazo's hill, And how he soared so high above, It looked a valley, he a dove): â'Twould fire your very carapace To see me with a dog in chase!â Its snout in any kind of swill, Pride, like a pig, will suck its fill. A SOCIALIST âYou're keeping me poorâI have only this egg. All rich men are rascals!â said Impycu Dregg. Couponicus Pigg said: âYour thanks, then, are due To me for not making a rascal of you.â But Impycu Dregg all the same flung his egg, Which burst in the wig of Couponicus Pigg. THE CO-DEFENDANTS A Jackass by a Lion chased Had made so admirable haste That his pursuer, far behind, Had, long before, his hope resigned And gone to sleep; but still poor Jack Pressed on, nor ventured to look back. âWhy, what's the matter?â cried a Steer, Obstructing him in his career. âOut of the way and let us pass!â Roared the still apprehensive Ass. ââUsâ? Why, my friend,â the Steer replied, âI see but you, and none beside.â âI'm but the foremost,â answered Jackâ âThe woods are full of us 'way back. Behold, he clawed me here and here; See how he tore my precious ear! Believe me, sir, your count's at faultâ No one escapes that cat's assault.â To let them limp along, the Steer Backed off in wonder and in fear. The Ass evanished like a flame, But not another donkey came. Then said the Steer: âI've savedâwell done!â All jackasses beneath the sun, Rolled into one, rolled into one.â IN CONSEQUENCE OF APPLAUSE âWhat makes you so round?â Said an indolent Hound To a Tiger that looked As if he had booked All the pilgrims of earth For an inside berth. Said the Tiger: âI strayed To the edge of a glade Where a man on a stump, Sleek, handsome and plump, His notions expounded To those who surrounded Him there with their ears Erected like spears For the words that he flung From his flickering tongue.â âYes, yes, my good cat, But what of all that? That statesman, I swear, Had enough and to spare Of the breezes that blow Out of heaven, but, O 'Tis remarkably odd he Could blow up your body And make you so poddy.â âBy-and-by the man stopped, And his forehead he mopped, And his scalpâwhich was bald. Then somebody called For three cheersââ âHully Gee! I'm beginning to see.â âAnd a tiger. That's me.â</field>
