      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. PREFACE. The following work is the result of an attempt to do something for the cause of American literature, by calling into notice and preserving a portion of what is valuable and characteristic in the writings of our native poets. As a pursuit of mere literary curiosity, there exist no ordinary inducements to the prosecution of such an enterprise, but when we take into view the influence which an endeavor like this, to rescue from oblivion the efforts of native genius must necessarily have upon the state of letters among us, we shall have occasion to wonder that an undertaking of the kind has not sooner been entered upon. The truth is, that our neglect upon this point is in some degree a matter of reproach to us. The literary productions of our fathers have been held in unwarrantable disesteem by their descendants, who have reason to pride themselves upon the monuments of genius and learning left them by preceding generations. What though our early literature cannot boast of a Dante or a Chaucer, it can furnish such testimonials of talent and mental cultivation as are highly creditable to the country, and of sufficient interest to call upon the attention of those who are desirous of tracing the general history of letters, and their connexion with the development of the moral and intellectual character of a people; while to us, as Americans, they possess a double value, and deserve to be cherished, as the inheritance of a race whose virtues have consecrated whatever they have left behind them. Again, everything published among us must have some value, if not on account of its intrinsic merits, at least as affording some insight into the spirit and temper of the times, and illustrating the degree of social and mental improvement in the community. Hitherto we have paid too little regard to our native literature in this last relation, and while the polite letters of foreign countries have been studied in such a philosophical view by the most accomplished scholars of our land, the same interesting field of observation at home has been overlooked. We have known men familiar with the details of Tiraboschi, Bouterwek and Sismondi, who had hardly bestowed a thought upon the most gifted spirits of the soil where they were born and bred: as if the poets of the western world could not bear some characteristic traits of their day and generation as well as the Minnesingers and Trouvéres; or as if a lay of the pilgrim fathers of New England could not illustrate a point of national or individual character as effectually as the Gongorism of the Castilian rhymesters of old. This is surely a preposterous state of things. What has been produced in the shape of literature among us merits regard. It must furnish something worthy of note in respect to the intellectual character of our nation. If it exhibit no marks of originality, it must show something of imitation, and it cannot but interest us to know the fact, for even that must have its significance. The object, therefore, of the work which I here present to the public, is to answer, so far as my opportunities would enable me to do it, the demand which has already been manifested, to know in a general and comprehensive view, what has been done in the department of poetry by American writers. Thus far we have seen no such thing as a collection of American poetry designed for such a purpose, nor a treatise designating with fulness and accuracy, the character of the various performances in verse of our native authors, nor even a tolerably complete list of their names. We are now becoming a literary people, and are already inquisitive upon all matters connected with our character and prospects in that relation. We begin to show a national spirit in letters, and deem it important not only to exhibit to the world what manner of men we are, but to cast an eye upon those who preceded us in the career of literary improvement, and look seriously into the grounds of the insinuation thrown out some years ago by our neighbors across the ocean, that there was no such thing as an American book worthy of being read. Our countrymen have done sufficient since that period to free us from the apprehension that the charge will be repeated; still it is a matter of interest to inquire whether nothing had been achieved before the days of Irving and Cooper and Pierpont and Percival, or whether, on the contrary, there were brave men living before Agamemnon. I have endeavored to perform the task of supplying what seemed a desideratum. Whatever may be the estimation set upon my labors, I have the pleasure of presenting my countrymen with a collection of matter which no one can deny to be highly honorable to the land of our birth. The American reader will learn with surprise and gratification that a body of literature so respectable under all circumstances, as that contained in the following pages, can be gathered from the writings of our native authors. If, as I flatter myself, they may succeed so far as to make us better acquainted with the master spirits of our literature, and of consequence lead us to a more exalted appreciation of the intellectual capabilities of our countrymen, I shall reap a full reward for my exertions, in the reflection of having assisted in fostering a national spirit in a department, where, until such a spirit prevails, neither ourselves, nor the world will do full credit to the principles of our institutions, or the genius of our people. That I have done entire justice to my task, I will not pretend. Were it allowed an author to go into a detail of the disadvantages under which he sets about his work, for the purpose of excusing its faults, I could furnish without difficulty in the present instance, a catalogue sufficient to account for the imperfections which I cannot help foreseeing, will be charged against these volumes. But with the greater part of a writer's disabilities or disadvantages, the world has no concern, and very properly will not suffer them to be pleaded in excuse for the defects which mar his productions. I shall therefore speak only of the difficulties inseparable from the present undertaking. I allude chiefly to the collection of the materials for the work. When it is considered, that nothing similar to this enterprise has ever before been attempted, the reader must be aware of the laborious nature of the researches necessary to be made. The whole collection of American literature was to be explored minutely without guide or direction, and the difficulty of such a task can be estimated only by those who have attempted something similar. There was no where, as I before remarked, even a tolerably accurate list of American authors. Their works were scattered as diversely as the leaves of the Sybil, and many of them were about as easily to be procured. We have no collections of them in public libraries, The principal libraries in Boston and the neighborhood, New York, Philadelphia, and Worcester, have been examined in search of materials for the work. In neither of these does there appear to have been any attempt made at such a collection. The most valuable one is in the possession of Professor Ticknor of this city, comprising about seventy volumes of the scarce old writers. That gentleman will accept my thanks for the readiness he has manifested to afford me all such assistance as his library could furnish. and some had become so completely forgotten that I was indebted in many cases to accident for their discovery. The ommissions therefore which may be discerned in these volumes the reader I trust will ascribe to the right cause. For inaccuracies in the biographical department, should any be discovered, I must plead for a similar indulgence. The best authorities however have been applied to for this species of information, and I feel confident in asserting that it may in general be relied upon. In the case of many of the most important subjects, the facts have been furnished by the authors themselves, in others, by their relations, or intimate associates. The additions thus made to the stock of biography by this original matter, forms not the least valuable portion of the work. The plan upon which the latter part has been executed, will, it is hoped, meet the general approbation, although, perhaps, somewhat different from what the public had been led to expect. It was thought best upon mature consideration, to extend the work down to the present day, and embrace within it every one who had written with credit. On account of the rapid extension of literature among us within a short period, a fair representation could not in any other way be given of what we are likely to accomplish. It will be perceived that I have left out the drama. It was originally intended to include all the dramatic productions in verse, but having learnt that a History of the American Stage was preparing by one who has been long conversant with the subject, and who possesses peculiar advantages for such a business, I deemed it most advisable to leave that part of the field untouched. It remains for me to speak of the assistance which I have received in the course of my labors, and of the obligations due from me to those gentlemen who have so kindly lent me their aid in various shapes. Some of the biography and criticism, has been furnished by other hands. This will account for those slight discrepancies of opinion, which may be detected in two or three different pieces. To Mr Frederic S. Hill, who in the outset took the editorial charge of the work, I am indebted for all which relates to Mather, Wolcott, Wigglesworth, Colman, Mrs Turell, Adams and J. Osborn. A few other articles are also the contributions of my friends. For the general character of these portions of the work, however, I hold myself responsible. In selecting the specimens it will be observed that I have extracted pretty liberally from the volumes of some of our most distinguished writers. It seemed the most eligible method to give entire pieces of some length, when this could be done advantageously, rather than short and detached portions of different poems. I have in all cases where it was practicable, applied to the authors for permission to make such an appropriation of their writings, and this they have in every instance been so obliging as to grant. Under the persuasion that the American public will look with indulgence upon the effort here shown to turn their attention to the literature and talent of their own countyr, I now submit these volumes to their inspection. The undertaking is one which I think they cannot but contemplate with interest. With what degree of credit I have aquitted myself of the charge, it remains for them to determine. S. K. Boston, April, 1829. INTRODUCTION. The early settlers of New England were no less distinguished for their attachment to letters than for their strong religious character; and although their taste and partialities lay rather toward the substantial than the ornamental parts of literature, yet the commune vinculum, the natural and intimate connexion of all liberal pursuits, unavoidably turned their studies in some degree in the latter direction. A great number of the earliest emigrants were men of the first attainments in the principal sciences held in repute at that period, and their writings reflect no small honor on their character for learning and ability. Their earliest attempts in the department of polite literature, must certainly be considered rude and feeble, when compared with the contemporaneous productions of Europe, but they deserve attention from the influence which they undoubtedly exercised upon the writers who succeeded them, no less than from the light they throw upon the character of the writers and the state of society. They also possess an interest arising from the curiosity we naturally feel to view the most ancient memorials of literary effort on record among us. We shall proceed therefore to enumerate such of the first settlers of the country as were known for any productions in verse which have remained to the present day, and give a brief historical sketch of the early poetical literature of the English Colonies. It was hardly three years from the arrival of the pilgrims that the first essay of this kind was made by William Morell, an episcopal clergyman, who wrote a description of New England in Latin hexameter verse. Morell came to this country in 1623 and remained about a year. Except therefore, as being the earliest attempt at versification within the present limits of the country, his performance can hardly claim any remark here. It was published in England with a translation by the author. Both have been reprinted in the collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society. The next poetical production which offers itself to our notice is the version of the Psalms published at Cambridge in 1640, and which was the first book printed in the United States. Although this was the first book, it was not the first specimen of printing in the country. The year previous there was published an Almanack and The Freeman's Oath. About the year 1639 the clergymen of New England considering that in their new residence they had been enabled to enjoy most of the ordinances of christian worship in all desirable purity, were induced to extend the reform they had thus effected, to the ordinance of the singing of psalms. The common metrical translation of the psalms was considered to deviate so far from the original as to be an unsatisfactory help to their devotions. A new version was therefore resolved upon, and the several portions of the work were assigned to the most eminent divines of the country. The principal of these whom we find mentioned were John Eliot of Roxbury, the celebrated Indian Apostle, Thomas Welde of Roxbury, and Richard Mather of Dorchester. The work thus produced was such as might have been expected from the plan. The main object of the translators was of course to make the version as literal as possible. An extract from their preface may serve to give the reader the views which they entertained of the nature of their task. “If therefore the verses are not always so smooth and elegant as some may desire and expect, let them consider that God's altar needs not our polishings; for wee have respected rather a plain translation, than to smooth our verses with the sweetness of any paraphrase, and so have attended to conscience rather than elegance, fidelity rather than poetry, in translating the Hebrew words into English language, and David's poetry into English meetre.” This book was called The Bay Psalm Book. The version is exact enough in respect of adherence to the original to satisfy the scruples of the most rigid critic. But the versification is harsh and unmusical to the last degree, and it was soon found expedient to give it a little more polish. The following extract will convey some idea of the rest of the work. PSALM CXXXVII. 1. The rivers on of Babilon, there when wee did sit downe, Yea even then wee mourned when wee remembered Sion. 2. Our harp wee did hang it amid, Upon the willow tree, 3. Because there they that us away led in captivitee Requir'd of us a song, and thus ask't mirth us waste who laid, Sing us among a Sion's song, unto us then they said. 4. The Lord's song sing can wee? being in strangers land, then let 5. loose her skill my right hand if I Jerusalem forget. 6. Let cleave my tongue my pallate on if minde thee doe not I, if chiefe joyes o're I prize not more Jerusalem my joy. 7. Remember Lord, Edoms sons' word, unto the ground said they, it rase it rase, when as it was Jerusalem her day. 8. Blest shall hee bee that payeth thee daughter of Babilon, who must be waste, that which thou hast rewarded us upon. 9. O happie hee shall surely bee that taketh up, that eke thy little ones against the stones doth into pieces breake. After two editions had been printed, an improvement of the language was declared necessary. It was therefore put into the hands of the Rev. Henry Dunster, President of Harvard College and Mr Richard Lyon, a tutor to a young student at Cambridge. These editors gave the work a revision “with a special eye,” as they inform us, “both to the gravity of the phrase of sacred writ, and sweetness of the verse.” They added versifications of some other portions of scripture, entitling them The Spiritual Songs of the Old and New Testament. This “improved version” has gone through more than thirty editions in this country, and has been often reprinted in Scotland and England, and used in many of the English dissenting congregations. The earliest poet of New England, however, was Anne Bradstreet, the wife of Simon Bradstreet, Governor of the Massachusetts colony, and daughter of Thomas Dudley, also Governor. She was born in 1612, probably at Northampton or Boston in England. She was married to Mr Bradstreet at the age of sixteen, and came the next year, 1630, with her husband to this country. The preface to the second edition of her poems published after her death, declares the volume to be “the work of a woman honored and esteemed, where she lives, for her gracious demeanor, her eminent parts, her pious conversation, her courteous disposition, her exact diligence in her place, and discreet managing of her family occasions; and more than so these poems are the fruit but of some few hours, curtailed from her sleep and other refreshments.” She died September 16th, 1672. One of the pieces in her volume bears the date of 1632, Ætatis suæ 19. Her writings gained her great celebrity among her contemporaries. Cotton Mather is warm in her praise and declares that “her poems, divers times printed, have afforded a grateful entertainment unto the ingenious, and a monument for her memory beyond the stateliest marbles.” The learned and excellent John Norton of Ipswich calls her the “mirror of her age and glory of her sex.” He wrote a funeral eulogy in which he did not scruple to pun upon her name according to the fashion of the time. “Her breast was a brave pallace, a broad street, Where all heroic, ample thoughts did meet, Where nature such a tenement had tane That other souls to hers dwelt in a lane.” Many others wrote verses in her commendation, and it is much to their credit that they so justly appreciated her talents; for we must come down to a late period in the literary annals of the country before we find her equal, although her productions are not without the marks of the barbarous taste of the age. Her first essays in polite composition had but an untoward guidance from the authors most esteemed at that time. The models they presented were not adapted to promote either good taste or excellence of any sort, in writing. Du Bartas Guillaume de Salluste du Bartas was a French poet of the time of Henry IV. His chief work was a poem on the creation, stuffed with absurdities. He called the head the lodging of the understanding, the eyes the twin stars, the nose the ‘gutter’ or ‘chimney,’ the teeth a double palisade used as a mill to the open throat. This poem was as much admired as is now Pollok's Course of Time, and in five or six years passed through thirty editions. It was translated into English. The earliest writings of New England abound with allusions to this author. was the favorite poet of the day, and his conceits seem to have been, in particular, the admiration of our author. She appears also to have caught something of his spirit. The contents of her volume are a poem upon the Four Elements, upon the Four Humors in Man's Constitution, upon the Four Ages of Man, and the Four Seasons of the Year. In these we are presented with personifications of Fire, Air, Earth and Water; Choler, Blood, Melancholy and Phlegm; and Childhood, Youth, Middle Age and Old Age, each of whom comes forward with an address in which its peculiar excellences are set forth. Then follows a versified history of the Four Monarchies of the World, and some shorter pieces, one of which, for its great merit, we shall extract; it shows Mrs Bradstreet to have possessed genuine poetical feeling. This poem is entitled CONTEMPLATIONS. Some time now past in the Autumnal Tide, When Phœbus wanted but one hour to bed, The trees all richly clad, yet void of pride, Were gilded o'er by his rich golden head. Their leaves and fruits seem'd painted, but was true Of green, of red, of yellow, mixed hew, Wrapt were my senses at this delectable view. I wist not what to wish, yet sure thought I, If so much excellence abide below; How excellent is He, that dwells on high! Whose power and beauty by his works we know. Sure he is goodness, wisdome, glory, light, That hath this under world so richly dight: More heaven than earth was here no winter and no night. Then on a stately oak I cast mine eye, Whose ruffling top the clouds seem'd to aspire; How long since thou wast in thine infancy? Thy strength, and stature, more thy years admire. Hath hundred winters past since thou wast born? Or thousand since thou brak'st thy shell of horn, If so, all these as nought, eternity doth scorn. Then higher on the glistering sun I gaz'd, Whose beams were shaded by the leavie tree, The more I look'd, the more I grew amaz'd, And softly said, what glory's like to thee? Soul of this world, this Universe's eye, No wonder, some made thee a deity; Had I not better known, (alas) the same had I. Thou as a bridegroom from thy chamber rushest, And as a strong man, joyes to run a race, The morn doth usher thee, with smiles and blushes, The earth reflects her glances in thy face. Birds, insects, animals with vegetive, Thy heart from death and dulness doth revive: And in the darksome womb of fruitful nature dive. Thy swift annual, and diurnal course, Thy daily straight, and yearly oblique path, Thy pleasing fervor, and thy scorching force, All mortals here the feeling knowledge hath. Thy presence makes it day, thy absence night, Quaternal seasons caused by thy might: Hail creature, full of sweetness, beauty and delight. Art thou so full of glory, that no eye Hath strength, thy shining rayes once to behold? And is thy splendid throne erect so high? As to approach it, can no earthly mould. How full of glory then must thy Creator be, Who gave this bright light luster unto thee! Admir'd, ador'd for ever, be that Majesty. Silent alone, where none or saw, or heard, In pathless paths I lead my wandering feet, My humble eyes to lofty skyes I rear'd To sing some song, my mazed Muse thought meet. My great Creator I would magnifie, That nature had, thus decked liberally: But Ah, and Ah, again, my imbecility! I heard the merry grasshopper then sing, The black clad cricket, bear a second part, They kept one tune, and plaid on the same string, Seeming to glory in their little art. Shall creatures abject, thus their voices raise? And in their kind resound their maker's praise: Whilst I as mute, can warble forth no higher layes. When present times look back to ages past, And men in being fancy those are dead, It makes things gone perpetually to last, And calls back months and years that long since fled. It makes a man more aged in conceit, Than was Methuselah, or's grand-sire great; While of their persons and their acts his mind doth treat. Sometimes in Eden fair he seems to be, Sees glorious Adam there made Lord of all, Fancyes the Apple, dangle on the Tree, That turn'd his Sovereign to a naked thral. Who like a miscreant's driven from that place, To get his bread with pain, and sweat of face: A penalty impos'd on his backsliding race. Here sits our Grandame in retired place, And in her lap, her bloody Cain new born, The weeping Imp oft looks her in the face, Bewails his unknown hap, and fate forlorn; His mother sighs, to think of Paradise, And how she lost her bliss, to be more wise, Believing him that was, and is, Father of lyes. Here Cain and Abel come to sacrifice, Fruits of the earth, and fatlings each do bring; On Abel's gift the fire descends from skies, But no such sign on false Cain's offering; With sullen hateful looks he goes his wayes. Hath thousand thoughts to end his brothers dayes, Upon whose blood his future good he hopes to raise. There Abel keeps his sheep, no ill he thinks, His brother comes, then acts his fratricide, The Virgin Earth, of blood her first draught drinks, But since that time she often hath been cloy'd; The wretch with ghastly face and dreadful mind, Thinks each he sees will serve him in his kind, Though none on Earth but kindred near then could he find. Who fancyes not his looks now at the barr, His face like death, his heart with horror fraught, Nor male-factor ever felt like warr, When deep despair, with wish of life hath sought, Branded with guilt, and crusht with treble woes, A vagabond to Land of Nod he goes, A city builds, that wals might him secure from foes. Who thinks not oft upon the Fathers ages. Their long descent, how nephew's sons they saw, The starry observations of those Sages, And how their precepts to their sons were law How Adam sigh'd to see his progeny, Clothed all in his black sinfull livery, Who neither guilt, nor yet the punishment could fly. Our Life compare we with their length of dayes, Who to the tenth of theirs doth now arrive? And though thus short, we shorten many ways, Living so little while we are alive; In eating, drinking, sleeping, vain delight, So unawares comes on perpetual night, And puts all pleasures vain unto eternal flight. When I behold the heavens as in their prime, And then the earth (though old) still clad in green, The stones and trees, insensible of time, Nor age nor wrinkle on their front are seen; If winter come, and greenness then do fade, A Spring returns, and they more youthful made; But Man grows old, lies down, remains where once he 's laid. By birth more noble than those creatures all, Yet seems by nature and by custome cursed, No sooner born, but grief and care make fall That state obliterate he had at first. Nor youth, nor strength, nor wisdom spring again, Nor habitations long their names retain, But in oblivion to the final day remain. Shall I then praise the heavens, the trees, the earth, Because their beauty and their strength last longer? Shall I wish their, or never to had birth, Because they're bigger, and their bodyes stronger? Nay, they shall darken, perish, fade and dye, And when unmade, soever shall they lye, But man was made for endless immortality. Under the cooling shadow of a stately elm Close sate I by a goodly River's side, Where gliding streams the rocks did overwhelm; A lonely place, with pleasures dignified. I once that lov'd the shady woods so well, Now thought the rivers did the trees excell, And if the sun would ever shine, there would I dwell. While on the stealing stream I fixt mine eye, Which to the long'd-for Ocean held its course, I markt nor crooks, nor rubs that there did lye Could hinder aught, but still augment its force: O happy Flood, quoth I, that holdst thy race Till thou arrive at thy beloved place, Nor is it rocks or shoals that can obstruct thy pace. Nor is 't enough, that thou alone may'st slide, But hundred brooks in thy cleer waves do meet, So hand in hand along with thee they glide To Thetis' house, where all embrace and greet: Thou Emblem true, of what I count the best, O could I lead my Rivulets to rest, So may we press to that vast mansion, ever blest. Ye Fish which in this liquid region 'bide, That for each season, have your habitation, Now salt, now fresh, where you think best to glide, To unknown coasts to give a visitation, In lakes and ponds, you leave your numerous fry, So nature taught, and yet you know not why, You watry folk that know not your felicity. Look how the wantons frisk to taste the air, Then to the colder bottome straight they dive, Eftsoon to Neptune's glassie Hall repair To see what trade the great ones there do drive, Who forrage o'er the spacious sea-green field, And take the trembling prey before it yield, Whose armour is their scales, their spreading fins their shield. While musing thus with contemplation fed, And thousand fancies buzzing in my brain, The sweet-tongued Philomel percht o'er my head, And chanted forth a most melodious strain Which rapt me so with wonder and delight, I judg'd my hearing better than my sight, And wisht me wings with her a while to take my flight. O merry Bird (said I) that fears no snares, That neither toyles nor hoards up in thy barn, Feels no sad thoughts, nor cruciating cares To gain more good, or shun what might thee harm; Thy cloaths ne'er wear, thy meat is every where, Thy bed a bough, thy drink the water cleer, Reminds not what is past, nor what's to come dost fear The dawning morn with songs thou dost prevent, i. e. Anticipate. Setts hundred notes unto thy feather'd crew, So each one tunes his pretty instrument, And warbling out the old, begins anew, And thus they pass their youth in summer season, Then follow thee into a better Region, Where winter's never felt by that sweet airy legion. Man's at the best a creature frail and vain, In knowledge ignorant, in strength but weak: Subject to sorrows, losses, sickness, pain, Each storm his state, his mind, his body break: From some of these he never finds cessation, But day or night, within, without, vexation, Troubles from foes, from friends, from dearest, near'st Relation. And yet this sinfull creature, frail and vain, This lump of wretchedness, of sin and sorrow, This weather-beaten vessel wrackt with pain, Joyes not in hope of an eternal morrow: Nor all his losses, crosses and vexation, In weight, in frequency and long duration Can make him deeply groan for that divine Translation. The Mariner that on smooth waves doth glide, Sings merrily, and steers his barque with ease, As if he had command of wind and tide, And now become great Master of the seas; But suddenly a storm spoils all the sport, And makes him long for a more quiet port, Which 'gainst all adverse winds may serve for fort. So he that saileth in this world of pleasure, Feeding on sweets, that never bit of th' sowre, That's full of friends, of honour and of treasure, Fond fool, he takes this earth ev'n for heav'ns bower. But sad affliction comes and makes him see Here's neither honor, wealth, nor safety; Only above is found all with security. O Time the fatal wrack of mortal things, That draws oblivion's curtains over kings, Their sumptuous monuments, men know them not, Their names without a Record are forgot, Their parts, their ports, their pomp's all laid in th' dust, Nor wit nor gold, nor buildings scape time's rust; But he whose name is grav'd in the white stone Shall last and shine when all of these are gone. The sister of Mrs Bradstreet, Mrs Woodbridge, the wife of John Woodbridge, minister at Andover and Newbury, was likewise an adventurer in verse. An epistle which she addressed to her sister upon the subject of her volume, is still extant. The poetry is respectable, but has no striking passages. Governor Dudley, the father of Mrs Bradstreet, was a versifier. He wrote an epitaph on himself which was found in his pocket after his death; it is hardly worth quoting, and we know not whether any other of his rhymes have been preserved. William Bradford, the second Gove nor of Plymouth Colony, who came over in the first ship in 1620, figured also as a poet. He died in 1657. His Descriptive and Historical Account of New England in verse, containing about three hundred lines, may be found in the Historical Collections. He is commended by the author of the Magnalia for his great learning and particularly for his skill in various languages. His verses however have little to recommend them. John Cotton, the minister of Boston, must be recorded among those who attempted poetry. Some of his verses upon the death of two of his children have been preserved, written in Greek letters upon the blank leaves of his Almanack. His elegy upon the death of Thomas Hooker, the first minister of Hartford, Connecticut, who died in 1647, has been commended as sensible and correct. We give a short extract. Twas of Geneva's worthies said with wonder, (Those worthies three) Farel was wont to thunder; Viret like rain on tender grass to shower, But Calvin, lively oracles to pour. All these in Hooker's spirit did remain, A soc of thunder and a shower of rain; A pourer forth of lively oracles, In saving soul the summ of miracles. Ezekiel Rogers the minister of Rowley, who gave that town its name, and died in 1660, also ‘embalmed’ the memory of Hooker in the following epitaph, every line of which, in the judgment of Cotton Mather, deserved a reward equal to that which Virgil received for his verses upon Marcellus in the Æneid. America, although she do not boast Of all the gold and silver from that coast, Lent to her sister Europe's need and pride; (For that repaid her with much gain beside, In one rich pearl which heaven did thence afford, As pious Herbert gave his honest word;) Yet thinks she in the catalogue may come With Europe, Africk, Asia, for one tomb. The same event was lamented in an elegy by Peter Bulkly, the first minister of Concord, whose latin verses written at the age of seventy-six, are preserved in the Magnalia, along with the latin poetry of Elijah Corlet of Cambridge upon the character of Hooker. The death of any noted divine in those days seems to have been very certain to arouse the muse of our ancestors. Scarcely one of any eminence closed his mortal career without drawing forth a profusion of elegiac strains. When John Cotton died in 1652, the event afforded a theme to Benjamin Woodbridge for a poem which contains a somewhat remarkable passage, as it has been conjectured that it suggested to Franklin the hint for his celebrated epitaph upon himself. Benjamin Woodbridge was educated partly at Oxford in England, and coming to this country finished his studies at Harvard College, of which he had the honor of being the first graduate. He afterwards returned to England and became one of the chaplains of Charles II. The passage referred to is this. A living breathing bible; tables where Both covenants at large engraven were; Gospel and law in 's heart had each its column, His head an index to the Sacred volume, His very name a title-page, and next His life a commentary on the text. O what a monument of glorious worth, When in a new edition he comes forth, Without erratas, may we think he'll be, In leaves and covers of eternity! Joseph Capen, minister of Topsfield, wrote some lines upon the death of Mr John Foster, a mathematician and printer, which have a still more remarkable similarity to the epitaph of Franklin. Thy body which no activeness did lack, Now 's laid aside like an old almanack; But for the present only 's out of date, 'T will have at length a far more active state: Yea, though with dust thy body soiled be, Yet at the resurrection we shall see A fair edition, and of matchless worth, Free from erratas, new in heaven set forth; Tis but a word from God the great Creator, It shall be done when he saith Imprimatur. John Norton also commemorated the death of Cotton by an elegy; his verses in praise of Mrs Bradsheet have already been mentioned. Nathaniel Ward, the Simple Cobler of Agawam, wrote poetry in his facetious way Edward Johnson the author of the Wonder Working Providence, interspersed his history with a multitude of verses, laudatory of the several worthy and eminent men of whom he had occasion to speak. His poetry is to be found in the records of Woburn, the town where he passed the latter part of his life. Roger Williams wrote verses among his other works during his banishment; some of them have been preserved in his Key to the Indian Languages. We offer a short specimen. Yeeres thousands since God gave command, As we in scripture find, That earth and trees and shrubs should bring Forth fruits each in his kind. The wilderness remembers this; The wild and howling land Answers the toiling labour of The wildest Indian's hand. But man forgets his maker who Fram'd him in righteousnesse A Paradise in Paradise now worse Than Indian wildernesse. Jonathan Mitchel, Pastor of the church in Cambridge, deserves some notice for his attempts at poetry. Upon the death of Henry Dunster, one of the translators of the Bay Psalm Book, who was dismissed from his office as President of Harvard College for his heterodox opinions upon the subject of baptism, Mitchel wrote an elegy, some stanzas of which deserve transcribing for the strain of liberal sentiment which they breathe on the subject of the President's religious notions. Where faith in Jesus is sincere, That soul, he saving, pardoneth; What wants or errors else be there, That may and do consist therewith. And though we be imperfect here, And in one mind can't often meet, Who know in part, in part may err, Though faith be one, all do not see 't. Yet may we once the rest obtain, In everlasting bliss above, Where Christ with perfect Saints doth reign, In perfect light and perfect love. Then shall we all like-minded be, Faith's unity is there full grown; There one truth all both love and see, And thence are perfect made in one. There Luther both and Zuinglius, Ridley and Hooper there agree There all the truly righteous Sans feud live to eternity. John Wilson, the Paul of New England, who is celebrated by Cotton Mather as the greatest “anagrammatizer” The rage for anagrams appears to have been universal in the country at that time. The biographer of Wilson cites the criticisms of the Jews upon the Old Testament in defence of the practice, and declares that much devout instruction was realized from this play upon names. He complains that there were not a greater number of anagrams made upon the name of Wilson, and insinuates that the muses looked very dissatisfied when they beheld the inscription on his tomb without this customary appendage. since the days of Lycophron, and who even uttered anagrams by improvisation, has also left specimens of his verse behind him; they may be found in the Magnalia. Thomas Shepard of Charlestown, who died in 1677, has left similar relics. He is better known by the Elegy which Urian Oakes, the President of Harvard College wrote upon his death. President Oakes was styled the Lactantius of New England; his fame as a scholar was widely extended, and his character pre-eminent for piety and benevolence. His elegy on Shepard's death was printed in 1677; a good authority has pronounced it a highly meritorious performance. We give a few stanzas taken from different parts of the poem. Art, nature, grace in him were all combined To show the world a matchless paragon, In whom of radiant virtues no less shined Than a whole constellation, but hee 's gone! Hee's gone, alas! down in the dust must ly As much of this rare person as could die! To be descended well, doth that commend? Can sons their fathers' glory call their own? Our Shepard justly might to this pretend, (His blessed father was of high renown: Both Englands speak him great, admire his name,) But his own personal worth's a better claim. His look commanded reverence and awe, Though mild and amiable, not austere: Well humour'd was he as I ever saw, And ruled by love and wisdom more than fear. The muses and the graces too conspired To set forth this rare piece to be admired. He breathed love and pursued peace in hisday, As if his soul were made of harmony. Scarce ever more of goodness crowded lay In such a piece of frail mortality. Sure Father Wilson's genuine son was he, New England's Paul had such a Timothy. The successor of President Oakes at Harvard was John Rogers. He came in his youth to New England and was educated at the College over which he was called to preside. Before he was chosen to the presidency he had been first a preacher and then a physician. He died suddenly in 1684, having been President but two years. His verses addressed to Mrs Bradstreet merit an insertion here. They have more correctness and elegance than are to be found in any we have yet noticed except those of the writer to whom they are addressed. Madam, twice through the Muses' grove I walkt, Under your blissfull bowres, I shrowding there, It seem'd with Nymphs of Helicon I talkt, For there those sweet-lip'd sisters sporting were. Apollo with his sacred lute sate by, On high they made their heavenly sonnets flye, Posies around they strow'd, of sweetest poesie. Twice have I drunk the nectar of your lines, Which high sublim'd my mean born phantasie, Flusht with these streams of your Maronean wines Above myself rapt to an extasie: Methought I was upon mount Hybla's top, There where I might those fragrant flowers lop, Whence did sweet odors flow, and honey spangles drop. To Venus' shrine no altars raised are, Nor venom'd shafts from painted quiver fly: Nor wanton Doves of Aphrodite's carr, Or fluttering there, nor here forlornly lie: Lorne paramours, not chatting birds tell news, How sage Apollo Daphne hot pursues, Or stately Jove himself is wont to haunt the stews. Nor barking Satyrs breathe, nor dreary clouds Exhaled from Styx, their dismal drops distil Within these fairy, flowry fields, nor shrouds The screeching night raven, with his shady quill: But lyrick strings here Orpheus nimbly hitts, Arion on his sadled dolphin sits, Chanting as every humour, age and season fits. Here silver swans, with nightingales set spells, Which sweetly charm the traveller, and raise Earth's earthed monarchs, from their hidden cells, And to appearance summon lapsed dayes, Their heav'nly air becalms the swelling frayes, And fury fell of elements allayes, By paying every one due tribute of his praise. This seem'd the scite of all those verdant vales, And purled springs, whereat the Nymphs do play: With lofty hills, where Poets rear their tales, To heavenly vaults, which heav'nly sound repay By echo's sweet rebound: here ladye's kiss, Circling nor songs, nor dance's circle miss; But whilst those Syrens sung, I sunk in sea of bliss. Thus weltring in delight, my virgin mind Admits a rape; truth still lyes undescri'd, Its singular that plural seem'd: I find 'T was fancie's glass alone that multipli'd; Nature with art so closely did combine, I thought I saw the Muses treble trine, Which prov'd your lonely Muse superiour to the Nine. Your only hand those poesies did compose: Your head the source, whence all those springs did flow: Your voice, whence changes sweetest notes arose: Your feet that kept the dance alone, I trow: Then vail your bonnets, Poetasters all, Strike, lower amain, and at these humbly fall, And deem yourselves advanc'd to be her pedestal. Should all with lowly congees laurels bring, Waste Flora's magazine to find a wreathe, Or Pineus' banks, 'twere too mean offering; Your Muse a fairer garland doth bequeath To guard your fairer front; here 't is your name Shall stand immarbled; this your little frame Shall great Colossus be, to your eternal fame. Peter Folger, who settled at Nantucket, where he kept a school, was the author of a poetical work entitled “A Looking Glass for the Times.” This was published in 1675 or 1676. Folger's daughter was the mother of Benjamin Franklin, and Franklin in his own life has given a description of the poem. We have not been able to obtain a sight of this performance. The only copy we have yet heard of, was in the possession of a friend a year or two since but is now lost. A few extracts have been published in one of our literary journals. We will quote the words of Franklin in describing the poem. “The author addresses himself to the governors for the time being; speaks for liberty of conscience, and in favor of the Anabaptist Quakers, and other sectaries who had suffered persecution. To this persecution he attributes the war with the natives and other calamities which afflicted the country, regarding them as the judgments of God in punishment of so odious an offence; and he exhorts the government to the repeal of laws so contrary to charity. The poem appeared to be written with a manly freedom and a pleasing simplicity.” Folger's book we understand is accurately described in the above paragraph, and a short extract which we have at hand will give an idea of the poetry. The rulers in the country I do own them in the Lord! And such as are for government, with them I do accord. But that which I intend hereby is that they would keep bound, And meddle not with God's worship for which they have no ground. And I am not alone herein, there many hundreds more, That have for many years ago spoke much upon that score. Indeed I really believe it 's not your business, To meddle with the church of Christ in matters more or less. The Rev. Samuel Danforth, of Roxbury, was a writer of verse. He was more celebrated, however, as a mathematician and astronomer. He calculated the trajectory of the great comet which appeared in 1664, and published a treatise on it entitled, “An astronomical description of the late comet with a brief theological description thereof.” John Danforth, of Dorchester, son of the above, claims to be mentioned for his verses; he wrote against religious controversy in the following strains. By hot contention's thunderbolts Are armies rent in twain. Armies of Abels too advance Arm'd with the clubs of Cain. Batter'd and shatter'd by such storms Are best men's reputation. In vain they talk while strife is loud Of waking reformation. In the following verses written in 1690, he attempted to point out the best method of christianizing the Indians. Address I pray, your Senate for good orders To civilize the heathen in our borders. Virtue must turn into necessity, Or this brave work will in its turn still lie. Till agriculture and cohabitation Come under full restrain and regulation, Much you would do you'll find impracticable, And much you do will prove unprofitable. In common lands that lie unfenced, you know, The husbandman in vain doth plough and sow. We hope in vain the plant of grace will thrive In forests where civility can't live. The next poet that offers himself to our notice is Benjamin Tompson the “learned schoolmaster and physician.” By the Boston Records it appears that he was master of the public school in Boston from 1667 to 1670, when having had and accepted a call to Charlestown, he removed thither and was succeeded by Cheever. He was the son of William Thompson or Tompson, the minister of Braintree, and was born at that place within the limits of the present town of Quincy, in 1640, and received a degree at Cambridge in 1662. To Benjamin Tompson His name B. Tompson, is subscribed to the original edition of one of his poems. The epitaph on his tombstone at Roxbury is as follows. Sub spe immortali ye herse of Mr Benjamin Thomson, learned schoolmaster and physician, and ye renowned poet of New England. Obiit Aprilis 13, Anno Domini 1714, et ætatis suæ 74. Mortuus sed immortalis must therefore be awarded all distinction of being the first native American poet. All his poetry hitherto known, was thought to be comprised in an Elegy upon the Rev. Samuel Whiting of Lynn, a poem addressed to Hubbard, and a few lines upon Cotton Mather. But we have lately discovered another work of his, which we consider the greatest curiosity as an antiquarian relic, that the early writings of New England present to us. It is a Poem on Philip's War, written and published, according to undoubted internal evidence, during that desperate struggle with the natives in which the very existence of the New England colonies was at stake. The poem is entitled New England's Crisis. We shall offer the reader one or two extracts of some length, no less to set in a fair light the merits of Tompson's poetry, than to gratify the curious with an exhibition of the strains in which our first native bard sung the wars which threatened the extinction of his nation. The author begins with a “Prologue,” in which he complains seriously of the great increase of luxurious habits in the country! One would think the land of the Pilgrims stood hardly in danger from this cause in 1675, when the females personally assisted to build a fortification on Boston neck for a protection against the savages. NEW ENGLAND'S CRISIS. THE PROLOGUE. The times wherein old Pompion was a saint, When men fared hardly yet without complaint, On vilest cates; the dainty indian maize Was eat with clamp-shells out of wooden trayes, Under thatch'd hutts without the cry of rent, And the best sawce to every dish, content. When flesh was food and hairy skins made coats, And men as wel as birds had chirping notes. When Cimnels Simnels. were accounted noble bloud; Among the tribes of common herbage food. Of Ceres' bounty form'd was many a knack, Enough to fill poor Robin's Almanack. These golden times (too fortunate to hold,) Were quickly sin'd away for love of gold. 'T was then among the bushes, not the street, If one in place did an inferior meet, “Good morrow brother, is there aught you want? “Take freely of me, what I have you ha'nt.” Plain Tom and Dick would pass as currant now, Then. As ever since “Your Servant Sir,” and bow. Deep-skirted doublets, puritanick capes, Which now would render men like upright apes, Was comlier wear, our wiser fathers thought, Than the cast fashions from all Europe brought. 'T was in those dayes an honest grace would hold Till an hot pudding grew at heart a cold. And men had better stomachs at religion, Than I to capon, turkey-cock, or pigeon; When honest sisters met to pray, not prate, About their own and not their neighbour's state. During Plain Dealing's reign, that worthy stud Of the ancient planters' race before the flood, Then times were good, merchants car'd not a rush For other fare than Jonakin and Mush. Although men far'd and lodged very hard, Yet innocence was better than a guard. 'T was long before spiders and worms had drawn Their dungy webs, or hid with cheating lawne New England's beautyes, which stil seem'd to me Illustrious in their own simplicity. 'T was ere the neighbouring Virgin-Land had broke The hogsheads of her worse than hellish smoak. 'T was ere the Islands sent their presents in, Which but to use was counted next to sin. 'T was ere a barge had made so rich a fraight As chocolate, dust-gold and bitts of eight. Ere wines from France and Moscovadoe to, Without the which the drink will scarsly doe. From western isles ere fruits and delicacies Did rot maid's teeth and spoil their handsome faces. Or ere these times did chance, the noise of war Was from our towns and hearts removed far. No bugbear comets in the chyrstal air Did drive our christian planters to despair. No sooner pagan malice peeped forth But valour snib'd it. Then were men of worth Who by their prayers slew thousands, angel-like; Their weapons are unseen with which they strike. Then had the churches rest; as yet the coales Were covered up in most contentious souls: Freeness in judgment, union in affection, Dear love, sound truth, they were our grand protection. Then were the times in which our councells sate, These gave prognosticks of our future fate. If these be longer liv'd our hopes increase, These warrs will usher in a longer peace. But if New England's love die in its youth, The grave will open next for blessed truth. This theame is out of date, the peacefull hours When castles needed not, but pleasant bowers. Not ink, but bloud and tears now serve the turn To draw the figure of New England's urne. New England's hour of passion is at hand; No power except divine can it withstand. Scarce hath her glass of fifty years run out, But her old prosperous steeds turn heads about, Tracking themselves back to their poor beginnings, To fear and fare upon their fruits of sinnings. So that the mirror of the christian world Lyes burnt to heaps in part, her streamers furl'd. Grief sighs, joyes flee, and dismal fears surprize Not dastard spirits only, but the wise. Thus have the fairest hopes deceiv'd the eye Of the big-swoln expectant standing by: Thus the proud ship after a little turn, Sinks into Neptune's arms to find its urne: Thus hath the heir to many thousands born Been in an instant from the mother torn: Even thus thine infant cheeks begin to pale, And thy supporters through great losses fail. This is the Prologue to thy future woe, The Epilogue no mortal yet can know. Having despatched his preliminaries the author plunges in medias res and gives us a representation of King Philip, who calls his warriors around him and makes to them a speech in choice Indian. We next have the incidents of the campaign, the marches of the troops, and the storming of an Indian fort. Then follow detached portions, celebrating battles, and the burning of towns, which items of intelligence appear to have come to hand while the author was writing his poem. In this manner we are presented with Marlburye's Fate; the Town called Providence, its Fate; Seaconk Plain Engagement; Seaconk or Rehoboth's Fate; Chelmsford's Fate, and lastly Lines On a Fortification at Boston begun by women. The subjoined extract will give an idea of his general manner. Many how welcomes from the natives' arms Hid in their sculking holes, many alarms Our brethren had, and many weary trants: Sometimes in melting heat and pinching wants. Sometimes the clouds with sympathizing tears Ready to burst, discharged about their ears. Sometimes on craggy hills, anon in bogs, And miry swamps, better befitting hogs; And after tedious marches, little boast Is to be heard of stew'd, or bakt, or roast. Their beds are hurdles, open house they keep, Through shady boughs the stars upon them peep: Their chrystal drink drawn from the mother's breast, Disposes not to mirth, but sleep and rest. Thus many dayes and weeks some months run out, To find and quell the vagabonding rout, Who like enchanted castles fair appear, But all is vanisht if you come but near. Just so we might the pagan archers track, With towns and merchandize upon their back: And thousands in the South who settled down, To all the points and winds are quickly blown. At many meetings of their fleeting crew, From whom like haile, arrows and bullets flew, The English courage with whole swarms dispute, Hundreds they hack in pieces in pursuit: Sed haud impuné, English sides do feel As well as tawny skins, the lead and steel; And some such gallant sparks by bullets fell As might have curst the powder back to hell. Had only swords these skirmishes decided, All pagan sculls had been long since divided. The ling'ring war outlives the summer sun, Who hence departs hoping it might be done Ere his return at spring; but ah! hee'l find The sword still drawn, men of unchanged mind. Cold winter now nibbles at hands and toes, And shrewdly pinches both our friends and foes. Fierce Boreas whips the pagan tribe together, Advising them to fit for foes and weather. The axe which late had tasted christian bloud, Now sets its steely teeth to feast on wood. The forests suffer now, by waight constrain'd To kiss the earth with soldiers lately brain'd. The lofty oakes and ashe doe wagge the head To see so many of their neighbours dead. Their fallen carcases are carried thence To stand our enemies in their defence. Their Myrmidons inclosed with clefts of trees, And busie like the ants or nimble bees. And first they limber poles fix in the ground, In figure of the heavens convex: all round They draw their arras-matts and skins of beasts, And under these the elves do make their nests. Rome took more time to grow than twice six hours, But half that time will serve for indian bowers; A citty shall be rear'd in one daye's space, As shall an hundred Englishmen out face. Canonicus' precints these swarmes unite, Rather to keep a winter guard than fight. A dern Lonely. and dismal swamp some scout had found, Whose bosom was a spot of rising ground Hedg'd up with mighty oakes, maples and ashes, Nurst up with springs, quick boggs and miery plashes; A place which nature coyn'd on very nonce, For tygers, not for men to be a sconce; Twas here these monsters shapt and fac'd like men Took up their Rendezvouz and brumal den. On the whole, Tompson must be allowed considerable praise; he is exceeded by none of his contemporaries for correct and smooth versification. Nicholas Noyes is another native poet; he was the nephew of James Noyes, the first minister of Newbury, and was born in that town December 22d, 1647. He was graduated at Cambridge in 1667, and settled in the ministry at Salem. His poem on the death of the Rev. Joseph Green, of Salem village, we have not seen. He wrote a prefatory poem to the Magnalia, from which we take the following lines complimentary of the author. Heads of our tribes whose corps are under ground, Their names and fames in chronicles renown'd, Begemm'd on golden ouches he hath set Past envy's teeth and time's corroding fret. Of death and malice he 's brush'd off the dust, And made a resurrection of the just. This well instructed scribe brings new and old, And from his mines digs richer things than gold; Yet freely gives, as fountains do their streams, Nor more than they, himself, by giving, drains. He 's all design, and by his craftier wiles Locks fast his reader, and the time beguiles; Whilst wit and learning move themselves aright, Through every line and colour in our sight, So interweaving profit with delight, And curiously inlaying both together That he must needs find both who looks for either. His preaching, writing, and his pastoral care Are very much to fall to one man's share. This added to the rest is admirable, And proves the author indefatigable. Play is his toyl, and work his recreation, And his inventions next to inspiration. His pen was taken from some bird of light, Addicted to a swift and lofty flight. Dearly it loves art, air, and eloquence, And hates confinement, save to truth and sense. The stuff is true, the trimming neat and spruce, The workman 's good, the work of public use; Most piously design'd, a Public Store, And well deserves the public thanks and more. Timothy Woodbridge, minister of Hartford, brother of Benjamin Woodbridge, already quoted, also complimented Mather and his book in a poetical address. Whether he was a native of this country or England we know not. We extract a few lines from his poem. Let the remotest parts of earth behold New England's crowns excelling Spanish gold. Here be rare lessons set for us to read, That offsprings are of such a goodly breed. The dead ones here so much alive are made, We think them speaking from blest Eden's shade. Hark how they check the madness of this age, The growth of pride, fierce lust and worldly rage; They tell we shall to clam-banks come again, If heaven still doth scourge us all in vain. But Sir, upon your merits heap'd will be The blessings of all those that here shall see Virtue embalm'd: this hand seems to put on The laurel on your brow, so justly won. The death of Urian Oakes in 1681 was lamented in an Elegy by Daniel Gookin, jr. son of Daniel Gookin who made the valuable Historical Collections respecting the Indians of New England. Daniel Gookin, jr. was born, as we have reason to think, at Cambridge. He was ordained as a minister there, and was afterwards a missionary among the Indians. We have never met with any mention of him as a poet. The elegy above-mentioned exists only in a single manuscript, the autograph perhaps of the author. We have a quotation of two stanzas at hand. This turns our dance to halting, lames our mirth, Untunes our harps, our hearts doth wound; No music 's now in any sound: Our hopes are cover'd o'er with clods of earth: 'T is this that kills the springing joys we had; Not heads but hearts are now in mourning clad. The time doth signalize this fatal turn: 'T was when the Father of the Day In haste was posting on his way To bury Summer in th' autumnal urn. 'T was when, as loath to see the dismal sight, Phœbus had coffin'd up himself in night. We know not whether John Hawkins, of Boston, has left any other specimen of his metre behind him, but we will introduce here his EPIGRAM ON PROVIDENCE. Lord are not ravens daily fed by thee? And wilt thou clothe the lilies and not me? Begone distrust, I shall have clothes and bread While lilies flourish and the birds are fed. Samuel Sewall, who came to America in his youth, was educated at Harvard College and afterwards became Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, was also a poet. His Hymn for the New Year, written Jan. 1st, 1701, “a little before break a day, at Boston of the Massachusetts,” we will cite as the earliest specimen we have of that sort of occasional composition. Once more our God vouchsafe to shine, Tame thou the rigour of our clime; Make haste with thy impatient light And terminate this long dark night. Let the translated English vine Spread further still, still call it thine. Prune it with skill, for yield it can More fruit to thee the husbandman. Give the poor Indians eyes to see The light of life, and set them free; That they religion may profess, Denying all ungodliness. From hardened Jews the veil remove, Let them their martyr'd Jesus love: And homage unto him afford, Because he is their rightful Lord. So false religion shall decay, And darkness fly before bright day; So man shall God in Christ adore, And worship idols vain no more. So Asia and Africa, Europa with America, All four in concert join'd, shall sing New songs of praise to Christ our King. Of the poetry of William Wetherell, of Scituate, we can offer no specimen. The same must be said of Joseph Rowlandson, of Lancaster, whose verses exist in some ancient manuscript files. There was an Indian youth by the name of Eleazar, who studied at Harvard College in 1678. He wrote Latin and Greek poetry, which has been preserved, but we have seen no verses in English from his pen. The Rev. Nathaniel Pitcher, of Scituate, was also a versifier. An anonymous poem on his death, compares him to Pindar, Horace and Casimir. How well he deserved this praise we have no means of knowing. The Elegy just mentioned is a curiosity. It is entitled Pitchero Threnodia; it is written in an odd metre, and with a great display of classical learning. Of the poetry nothing need be said. It was published at Bostonin 1724. An anonymous performance of contemporary date and greater merit, is the Gloria Britannorum, or the British Worthies, which appeared also at Boston. In this work the political and military events of the time are sung in the manner of Addison's Campaign, from which production the design was evidently borrowed. The versification is quite spirited and correct for the period. We must notice in this place, although a little in anticipation of the chronological order of persons, John Seccomb. He was esteemed a wit, and wrote the ballad entitled Father Abdy's Will. It is rather of the doggerel species, but was popular in the author's day, and pleased Governor Belcher so much that he sent it to England, where it was first published in the Gentleman's Magazine, in 1732. Seccomb was also considered the author of an Eclogue on the death of Dr Colman, and some other anonymous pieces. From a review of the character of these early and imperfect endeavours in the rhyming art, and of our literature generally, down to a very recent date, we perceive the perfectly spontaneous growth to every branch of polite letters among us. The common incitements to literary exertion, rivalry and the prospect of fame and emolument, cannot be said to have exerted any material influence in prompting the efforts of American writers. Authors have been too few to create competition, and the public, to whom they addressed themselves, too much occupied with matters of direct practical interest to bestow any high consideration upon the talents which are exerted only in the embellishment of life. Hence we have never known till the present day such a thing as a professed author. All the talent and industry of the people have been called into the field of active employment, and the most of what has been written among us consists of such productions as were executed in the early days of our authors, before the serious business of life was entered upon; or in such leisure moments as were snatched from constant and laborious occupations. We have obtained therefore only the unripe fruits of their youth, or the imperfect performances of casual moments. The cultivation of literary talent has moreover been retarded by the state of dependence as to literature, in which we have continued, to the writers of Great Britain. Without searching for causes which lie deep in the character of our nation, we may assert that the“bales and hogsheads” of learning which our friends beyond the ocean speak of having supplied us with, have been dealt to us in such abundance that the great stimulus to exertion has been wanting, and no pressing necessity has thrown us upon our own resources. Still the feeling of patriotism must prompt the desire that native genius should be conspicuous in every high career of human intellect, and that a national spirit in the liberal arts should be encouraged, as instruments to nourish the civic virtues and give scope to the energies of mind among our countrymen. That this has not hitherto been effected, can hardly excite surprise in any one acquainted with our history. While we have been filling this wide land with people, it is not remarkable that as a nation, we should have found little leisure to cultivate the refinements of intellectual taste, The present state and future prospects of literature among us offer a theme for fond anctipation and sagacious conjecture, but hardly for certain calculation. There is a vast amount of intellect daily developing in the community, and again absorbed in the great purposes to which the ingenuity and enterprise of our busy population are constantly giving birth. The precise effect of this power, when settled into regular channels of action in the various departments of literature cannot be foreseen. In the twilight of the morning of letters which now dawns upon us, the general outline of the view is indistinct and wavering, and the eye meets with hardly a point upon which to rest with steadiness. But nothing lingers; every moment some new element is unfolding, the shadows flee, and the hour cometh, we doubt not, which shall usher in a new scene, and englighten us with the fulness and splendor of a brighter day. COTTON MATHER. ON THE DEATH OF HIS SON. The motto, inscribed on the grave stone, “Reserved for a glorious Resurrection.” The exhortation of the Lord, With consolation speaks to us; As to his children his good word, We must remember speaking thus: My child, when God shall chasten thee, His chastening do thou not contemn: When thou his just rebukes dost see, Faint not rebuked under them. The Lord with fit afflictions will Correct the children of his love; He doth himself their father still, By his most wise corrections prove. Afflictions for the present here The vexed flesh will grievous call; But afterwards there will appear, Not grief, but peace, the end of all. ON THE DEATH OF HIS DAUGHTER. The motto, inscribed on the grave stone, “Gone, but not lost.” The dearest Lord of heaven gave Himself an offering once for me: The dearest thing on earth I have, Now, Lord, I'll offer unto Thee. I see my best enjoyments here, Are loans, and flowers, and vanities; Ere well enjoy'd they disappear: Vain smoke, they prick and leave our eyes. But I believe, O glorious Lord, That when I seem to lose these toys, What 's lost will fully be restor'd In glory, with eternal joys. I do believe, that I and mine, Shall come to everlasting rest; Because, blest Jesus, we are Thine, And with thy promises are blest. I do believe that every bird Of mine, which to the ground shall fall, Does fall at thy kind will and word; Nor I, nor it, is hurt at all. Now my believing soul does hear This among the glad angels told; I know, thou dost thy Maker fear, From whom thou nothing dost withhold! Some offers to Embalm the Memory of the truly reverend and renowned John Wilson; the first Pastor of Boston, in New England; Interr'd (and a great part of his Country's Glory with him) August 11, 1667. Aged 79. Might Aaron's rod (such funerals mayn't be dry) But broach the rock, 'twould gush pure elegy, To round the wilderness with purling lays, And tell the world, the great Saint Wilson's praise. Here 's one (pearls are not in great clusters found) Here 's one, the skill of tongues and arts had crown'd; Here 's one (by frequent martyrdom was tried) That could forego skill, pelf, and life beside, For Christ: both Englands' darling, whom in swarms They press'd to see, and hear, and felt his charms. 'Tis one (when will it rise to number two? The world at once can but one phœnix show:) For truth a Paul, Cephas for zeal, for love A John, inspir d by the celestial dove. Abram's true Son for faith; and in his tent Angels oft had their table and content. So humble, that alike on's charity, Wrought Extract gent. with Extract rudii. Pardon this fault; his great excess lay there, He 'd trade for Heaven with all he came anear; His meat, clothes, cash, he'd still for ventures send Consign'd, per brother Lazarus, his friend. Mighty in prayer, his hands uplifted reach'd Mercy's high Throne, and thence strange bounties fetch'd, Once and again, and oft: so felt by all, Who weep his death, as a departing Paul. All, yea, baptiz'd with tears, lo children come, (Their baptism he maintain'd!) unto his tomb. 'Twixt an Apostle, and Evangelist, Let stand his order in the heavenly list. Had we the costly alabaster box, What 's left, we'd spend on this New-English Knox; True Knox, fill'd with that great reformer's grace, In truth's just cause, fearing no mortal's face. Christ's word, it was his life, Christ's church, his care; And so great with him his least brethren were, Nor heat, nor cold, nor rain, or frost, or snow, Could hinder, but he'd to their sermons go: Aaron's bells chim'd from far, he'd run, and then His ravish'd soul echo'd amen, amen! He travers'd oft the fierce Atlantic sea, But, Patmos of confessors, 'twas for thee. This voyage lands him on the wished shore, From whence this Father will return no more, To sit the moderator of thy sages. But tell his zeal for thee to after ages, His care to guide his flock, and feed his lambs, By words, works, prayers, psalms, alms, and anagrams: Those anagrams, in which he made no start Out of mere nothings, by creating art, Whole words of counsel; did to motes unfold Names, till they lessons gave richer than gold, And every angle so exactly fay, It should outshine the brightest solar ray. Sacred his verse, writ with a cherub's quill; But those wing'd choristers of Zion's hill, Pleas'd with the notes, call'd him a part to bear With them, where he his anagram did hear, “I pray come in, heartily welcome sir.” REMARKS On the bright and the dark side of that American pillar, the Reverend Mr William Thompson; Pastor of the Church at Braintree. Who triumphed on Dec. 10, 1666. But may a rural pen try to set forth Such a great Father's ancient grace and worth? I undertake a no less arduous theme, Than the old sages found the Chaldee dream. 'Tis more than tythes of a profound respect, That must be paid such a Melchizedeck. Oxford this light, with tongues and arts doth trim; And then his northern town doth challenge him. His time and strength he center'd there in this; To do good works, and be what now he is. His fulgent virtues there, and learned strains, Tall, comely presence, life unsoil'd with stains, Things most on worthies, in their stories writ, Did him to moves in orbs of service fit. Things more peculiar yet, my muse, intend, Say stranger things than these; so weep and end. When he forsook first his Oxonian cell, Some scores at once from popish darkness fell; So this reformer studied! rare first fruits! Shaking a crab-tree thus by hot disputes, The acid juice by miracle turn'd wine, And rais'd the spirits of our young divine. Hearers, like doves, flock'd with contentious wing, Who should be first, feed most, most homeward bring. Laden with honey, like Hyblæan bees, They kneed it into combs upon their knees. Why he from Europe's pleasant garden fled, In the next age, will be with horror said. Braintree was of this jewel then possess'd, Until himself, he labor'd into rest. His inventory then, with John's, was took; A rough coat, girdle with the sacred Book. When reverend Knowles and he sail'd hand in hand, To Christ espousing the Virginian land, Upon a ledge of craggy rocks near stav'd, His Bible in his bosom thrusting sav'd; The Bible, the best of cordial of his heart, “Come floods, come flames, (cried he) we'll never part.” A constellation of great converts there, Shone round him, and his heavenly glory were. Gookins was one of these; by Thompson's pains, Christ and New England, a dear Gookins gains. With a rare skill in hearts, this doctor could Steal into them words that should do them good. His balsams, from the tree of life distill'd, Hearts cleans'd and heal'd, and with rich comforts fill'd. But here 's the wo! balsams which others cur'd. Would in his own turn hardly be endur'd. Apollyon owing him a cursed spleen Who an Apollos in the church had been, Dreading his traffic here would be undone By num'rous proselytes he daily won, Accus'd him of imaginary faults, And push'd him down so into dismal vaults: Vaults, where he kept long ember-weeks of grief, Till heaven alarmed sent him a relief. Then was a Daniel in the lion's den, A man, oh, how belov'd of God and men! By his bed side an Hebrew sword there lay, With which at last he drove the devil away. Quakers too durst not bear his keen replies, But fearing it half drawn the trembler flies, Like Lazarus, new rais'd from death, appears The saint that had been dead for many years. Our Nehemiah said, “shall such as I Desert my flock, and like a coward fly!” Long had the churches begg'd the saint's release; Releas'd at last, he dies in glorious peace. The night is not so long, but Phosphor's ray Approaching glories doth on high display. Faith's eye in him discern'd the morning star, His heart leap'd; sure the sun cannot be far. In extacies of joy, he ravish'd cries, “Love, love the Lamb, the Lamb!” In whom he dies. ROGER WOLCOTT. [Brief Account of the Agency of the Honorable John Winthrop, Esq. in the Court of King Charles the Second, Anno Dom. 1662; when he obtained a Charter for the Colony of Connecticut.] “Rise up,” quoth Charles; “my liberal hand supplies All needful help to every one that cries; Nor shall I be illiberal to you: But, prithee, Winthrop, please to let me know By whom it was your place did first commence, Your patriarchs that led your tribes from hence?” “If to declare their worth, is what you ask, Then I must beg your pardon. That's a task So worthy due performance, and so great, As goes beyond my utterance and conceit: But virtue never fails; succeeding days Shall much regard their merits, and shall raise Men of bright parts and moving oratory, Who shall emblazon their immortal glory. But if you ask to gain intelligence, What were the reasons why they went from hence, What straits they met with in their way, and there? These facts I think I'm able to declare. Religion was the cause: Divinity Having declar'd the gospel shine should be Extensive as the sun's diurnal shine; This mov'd our founders to this great design. And sure the holy spirit from above, That first did quickning on the waters move, Inspir'd their minds, and fill'd them with intents, To bring to pass such glorious events. And now they wholly to this work devote, Mind not the country they are going out: Their ancient homes they leave, to come no more. Their weeping friends and kindred on the shore They bid adieu, and with an aching heart Shake hands; 'tis hard when dearest friends must part. But here they part, and leave their parent isle, Their whilome happy seat. The winds awhile Are courteous, and conduct them on their way, To near the midst of the Atlantic sea, When suddenly their pleasant gales they change For dismal storms that on the ocean range. For faithless Æolus, meditating harms, Breaks up the peace, and priding much in arms, Unbars the great artillery of heaven, And at the fatal signal by him given, The cloudy chariots threatening take the plains; Drawn by wing'd steeds, hard pressing on their reins. These vast battalions, in dire aspect rais'd, Start from the barriers—night with lightning blaz'd. Whilst clashing wheels resounding thunder cracks, Struck mortals deaf, and heaven astonish'd shakes. Here the ship captain, in the midnight watch, Stamps on the deck, and thunders up the hatch; And to the mariners aloud he cries, ‘Now all from safe recumbency arise: All hands aloft, and stand well to your tack, Engendering storms have cloth'd the sky with black, Big tempests threaten to undo the world: Down topsail, let the mainsail soon be furl'd: Haste to the foresail, there take up a reef: 'Tis time, boys, now if ever, to be brief; Aloof for life; let 's try to stem the tide, The ship 's much water, thus we may not ride: Stand roomer then, let 's run before the sea, That so the ship may feel her steerage way: Steady at helm!’ Swiftly along she scuds, Before the wind, and cuts the foaming suds. Sometimes aloft she lifts her prow so high, As if she 'd run her bowsprit through the sky; Then from the summit ebbs and hurries down, As if her way were to the centre shown. Meanwhile our founders in the cabin sat, Reflecting on their true and sad estate; Whilst holy Warham's sacred lips did treat About God's promises and mercies great. Still more gigantic births spring from the clouds, Which tore the tatter'd canvass from the shrouds, And dreadful balls of lightning fill the air, Shot from the hand of the great Thunderer. And now a mighty sea the ship o'ertakes, Which falling on the deck, the bulk-head breaks; The sailors cling to ropes, and frighted cry, ‘The ship is foundered, we die! we die!’ Those in the cabin heard the sailors screech; All rise, and reverend Warham do beseech, That he would now lift up to heaven a cry For preservation in extremity. He with a faith sure bottom'd on the word Of Him that was of sea and winds the Lord, His eyes lifts up to Heaven, his hands extends, And fervent prayers for deliverance sends. The winds abate, the threatening waves appease, And a sweet calm sits regent on the seas, They bless the name of their deliverer, Who now they found a God that heareth prayer. Still further westward on they keep their way, Ploughing the pavement of the briny sea, Till the vast ocean they had overpast, And in Connecticut their anchors cast. Here came Soheage, and told the company, The garden of America did lie Further up the stream, near fifty miles from hence, Part of which country he himself was prince. Much ask'd of th' soil, much of the government, What kings were there? The land of what extent? All which, by his free answers, when they knew, They o'er his back a scarlet mantle threw. And now, invited with fresh southern gales, They weigh their anchors, and they hoist their sails, And northward for th' expected country stood, Upon the smiling pavement of the flood. At length they entered those awful straits, Where the stream runs through adamantic gates. 'Twas strange to see the banks advanc'd so high, As if with Atlas they bore up the sky. But when those dismal straits were passed through, A glorious country opens to their view, Cloth'd all in green, and to the eye presents Nature's best fruits and richest ornaments. Cheer'd with the sight, they set all sails a-trip, And rais'd the English ensign on their ship. Brave youths, with eager strokes, bend knotty oars, Glad shouts bring cheerful echoes from the shores. As when the wounded amorous doth spy His smiling fortune in his lady's eye, O how his veins and breast swell with a flood Of pleasing raptures, that revive his blood! And grown impatient now of all delays, No longer he deliberating stays; But through the force of her resistless charms, He throws him, soul and body, in her arms. So we, amazed at these seen delights, Which to fruition every sense invites, Our eager minds, already captive made, Grow most impatient now to be delay'd, This most delightful country to possess; And forward, with industrious speed, we press, Upon the virgin stream, who had, as yet, Never been violated with a ship. Upon the banks king Aramamet stood, And round about his wondering multitude, Greatly amaz'd at such an uncouth show: What is 't? they cried. Some say, a great canoe. Others, a bird that in the air doth fly, With her long bill, and wings up to the sky. But other some, whom fear did terrify, Cried, 'tis some ill-presaging prodigy. Nothing on earth more impetuous we find Than terror, when it seizeth on the mind. Dreadful effects of this did soon appear, The multitude surpris'd with chilling fear; With looks distracted, and out staring eyes, Each scares himself, and others terrifies; Only the king, who had within his breast, A heart which foolish fear could not infest, Perceived the matter, and the ship he hails: ‘Now drop your anchors, and unbend your sails; And if for peace and friendship you are come, And do desire this land should be your home, Let some of your chief leaders come to land, And now with me join their right hand to hand. Sails lower amain, nor oars now touch the flood, Down drop the anchors deep into the mud: Their chiefs repair to land, and with them bring, Obliging presents for the Indian king. Majestic Aramamet, with his lords, Steps forth to meet those guests without his guards; Meeting he paus'd, astonish'd at the sight; Such men, such airs, with countenances bright, He ne'er had seen, nor now to see expecting; Amaz'd he stood a while! but recollecting His scatter'd intellect, he cries, ‘Who's there? Whence come you? Seek you with us peace or war?’ ‘Britons you see, say they, and we are come From England, happiest seat in Christendom, Where mighty Charles obligeth sea and land, To yield obedience to his sceptred hand; Nor came we here to live with you in wars, As He knows best, that made sun, moon, and stars; But rather here to live with you in peace, Till day and night's successive changes cease. This we propose; and this if you approve, And do respect our neighborhood and love, Then sell us land, whereon we towns may plant, And join with us in friendly covenant.’ ‘What you propose, (quoth he,) is just and good, And I shall e'er respect your neighborhood; Land you may have, we value not the soil, Accounting tillage too severe a toil.’ Then he his own right hand to theirs doth join, Of his sure friendship the undoubted sign; Then brings them to his house, and from his boards Feasts them with what his country best affords. Whilst here they stay at Aramamet's court, Hither the neighboring Indian kings resort, And join with them in articles of peace, And of their lands make firm conveyances; And being now by deeds and leagues secure, Their towns they build, their purchas'd land manure.” Thus far he said; Then said his majesty, “Methinks, I have a curiosity To know this country, that for ages past Lay hid, and you have now found out at last; This new found river, is it fresh and fair? What land adjoins to it? Has 't a pleasant air?” “This gallant stream keeps running from the head Four hundred miles ere it with Neptune bed, Passing along hundreds of rivulets, From either bank its crystal waves besets, Freely to pay their tributes to this stream, As being chief and sovereign unto them; It bears no torrent nor impetuous course, As if 'twere driven to the sea by force. But calmly on a gentle wave doth move, As if 'twere drawn to Thetis' house by love. The water 's fresh and sweet; and he that swims In it, recruits and cures his surfeit limbs. The fisherman the fry with pleasure gets, With seines, pots, angles, and his trammel nets. In it swim salmon, sturgeon, carp and eels; Above, fly cranes, geese, ducks, herons and teals; And swans, which take such pleasure as they fly, They sing their hymns oft long before they die. The grassy banks are like a verdant bed, With choicest flowers all enameled, O'er which the winged choristers do fly, And wound the air with wondrous melody, Here philomel, high perch'd upon a thorn, Sings cheerful hymns to the approaching morn. The song once set, each bird tunes up his lyre, Responding heavenly music through the quire, Within these fields, fair banks of violets grows; And near them stand the air perfuming rose, And yellow lilies fair enameled, With ruddy spots here blushing hang the head. These meadows serve not only for the sight, To charm the eye with wonder and delight; But for their excellent fertility, Transcends each spot that ere beheld Sol's eye, Here lady Flora's richest treasure grows, And here she bounteously her gifts bestows. The husbandman, for all his diligence, Receives an ample, liberal recompense, And feasting on the kidneys of the wheat, Doth soon his labor and his toil forget. After the meadows thus have took their place, The champion plains draw up to fill the space. Fair in their prospect, pleasant, fruitful, wide, Here Tellus may be seen in all his pride. Cloud-kissing pines in stately mangroves stand, Firm oaks fair branches wide and large extend. The fir, the box, the balm tree, here stand mute, So do the nut trees, laden down with fruit. In shady vales the fruitful vine o'erwhelms The waving branches of the bending elms. Within the covert of these shady boughs, The loving turtle and his lovely spouse, From bough to bough, in deep affection move, And with chaste joy reciprocate their love. At the cool brooks, the beavers and the minks Keep house, and here the hart and panther drinks. And partridges here keep in memory, How to their loss they soared once too high. Within these spacious forests, fresh and green, No monsters of burnt Afric may be seen. No hissing basilisk stands to affright, Nor seps, nor hemorhus, with mortal bite; The Lybian lion ne'er set footing here, Nor tigers of Numidia do appear. But here the moose his spreading antlers sways, And bears down stubborn standels with their sprays. These sport themselves within these woods, and here The fatted roebuck and the fallow deer Yield venison as good as that which won The patriarchal benediction. Each plain is bounded at its utmost edge With a long chain of mountains in a ridge, Whose azure tops advance themselves so high, They seem like pendants hanging in the sky. Twentyfour miles, surveyors do account Between the eastern and the western mount; In which vast interspace, pleasant and fair, Zephyrus whispers a delightful air. These mountains stand at equidistant space From the fair flood, in such majestic grace, Their looks alone are able to inspire An active brain with a mercurial fire. The muses hence their ample dews distil, More than was feigned from the twy-topt hill. And if those witty men that have us told Strange tales of mountains in the days of old, Had they but seen how these are elevated, We should have found them far more celebrated, In the fine works that they have left to us, Than high Olympus or long Caucasus; Or Latmos, which Diana stops upon, There to salute her dear Endymion. Hither the eagles fly, and lay their eggs; Then bring their young ones forth out of those crags. And force them to behold Sol's majesty, In mid noon glory, with a steady eye. Here the old eagle his long beak belays Upon a rock, till he renews his days. And hence they from afar behold their prey, And with a steady pinion wing their way. But why so excellent a land should lie So many ages in obscurity, Unseen, unheard of, or unthought upon, I think there's no good reason can be shown Unless 'twere as it seems the mind of fate, Your royal name long to perpetuate, So order'd it that such a land might owe Thanks for its liberties, great Sir, to you.” “After devotions thus to Heaven paid, Up to the enemy our armies led, Silent as the riphean snow doth fall, Or fishes walk in Neptune's spacious hall. Now Lucifer had just put out his head, To call Aurora from old Tithon's bed. Whereat the troops of the approaching light, Began to beat the reg'ments of the night. But Morpheus, with his unperceived bands, Had clos'd the Pequots' eyes, and chain'd their hands. All lay asleep, save one sagacious wretch, Who destin'd was to stand upon the watch. Firm to his charge, with diligence he applies, And looks around with fierce lyncean eyes. When our avant couriers he espy'd, Opening his lungs aloud, ‘Auwunux!’ cry'd.” “Auwunux,” said our king, “what does that mean?” “It signifies,” said Winthrop, “Englishmen. The startling news doth every soldier rouse, Each arms and hastens to his rendezvous. Meantime the English did the fort attach And in the same had opened a breach, Through which our brave Alcides enter'd first, In after whom his valiant soldiers thrust. Before the breach an unappalled band Of warlike Pequots, with bow and arrows stand. With cheerful accents these themselves confirm, To die like men, or to outface the storm. Then gallantly the English they assail, With winged arrows, like a shower of hail. These ours endure; and with like violence, Sent lead and sulphur back in recompense. And now the sight grew more and more intense, Each violent death enflames the violence. Charge answered charge, and shout reply'd to shout; Both parties like enraged furies fought; Till death, in all its horrid forms appears, And dreadful noise keeps clamoring in our ears. Now as some spacious rivers in their way, By which they travel onwards to the sea, Meet with some mighty precipice, from whence, Enrag'd, they throw themselves with violence Upon the stubborn rocks that lie below, To make disturbance in the way they go. Here, though the fury of the fray doth make The near adjacent rocks and mountains quake, Still the remorseless stream keeps on its course, Nor will abate a moment of its force, But rather hastens by impetuous facts To throw itself into those cataracts. And so it happened with our soldiers here, Whose fortune 'twas to travel in the rear. The combatings of these within the breaches, With dreadful noise their listening ears attaches; And from their foes, and from their brethren, Loud cries of fighting and of dying men. Sense of the danger doth not them affright, But rather proves a motive to excite The martial flame in every soldier's breast, And on they like enraged lions prest; Determined upon the spot to die, Or from the foe obtain the victory. Now fortune shows to the beholders' sight, A very dreadful, yet a doubtful fight; Whilst mighty men, born in far distant land, Stood foot to foot, engaging hand to hand. As when some mighty tempests that arise, Meet with embattled fury in the skies: Fire balls of lightnings and loud thunders rend And tear the raging parties that contend. So did the fury of these mighty foes, With which they did each others' force oppose, Bring on such ruins as might daunt with fears The hearts of any men, excepting theirs. Never did Pequots fight with greater pride; Never was English valor better tried. Never was ground soak'd with more gallant blood Than the aceldama whereon we stood. Sometimes one party victory soon expect, As soon their eager hopes are countercheck'd. And those that seem'd as conquered before, Repel with greater force the conqueror. Three times the Pequots seemed to be beat: As many times they made their foes retreat. And now our hope and help for victory, Chiefly depended from the arm on high. As when Euroclydon the forest rends, The bigger oaks fall down, the lesser bends The beaten limbs and leaves before him scour, Affrighted and enforced by his power; To some huge rock, whose adamantine brow, Outbraves the fury of all winds that blow; There hoping to be hid from the high charge Of fierce pursuers, by his mighty verge. The winds in pressing troops demand surrender, Of the pursued, and boisterous storm and thunder; But he browbeats, and masters all their pride, And sends them roaring to the larboard side. So Mason here, most strongly dress'd in arms, Reanimates his men, their ranks reforms; Then leading on, through deaths and dangers goes, And beats the thickest squadrons of the foes. Prince Mononotto sees his squadrons fly, And on our general having fix'd his eye, Rage and revenge his spirits quickening, He set a mortal arrow in the string. Then to his god and fathers' ghosts he pray'd, ‘Hear, O immortal powers, hear me,’ he said; ‘And pity Mistick, save the tottering town, And on our foes hurl dreadful vengeance down. Will you forsake your altars and abodes, To those contemners of immortal gods? Will those pay hecatombs unto your shrine, Who have deny'd your powers to be divine? O favor us; our hopes on you are built; But if you are mindful of our former guilt, Determine final ruin on us all; Yet let us not quite unrevenged fall. Here I devote this of our enemies His precious life to you a sacrifice. Nor shall I covet long to be alive, If such a mischief I might once survive. But, O indulgent, hearken to my prayer; Try us once more; this once the city spare: And take my gift, let your acceptance be An omen we shall gain the victory.’ That very instant Mason did advance, Whereat rage interrupts his utterance; Nor could he add a word to what was said, But drew the winged arrow to the head: And aiming right, discharg'd it; whereupon Its fury made the piercing air to groan. But wary Mason, with his active spear, Glanced the prince's arrow in the air: Whereat the Pequots, quite discouraged, Threw down the gauntlet, and from battle fled. Mason, swift as the chased roe on foot, Outstrips the rest in making the pursuit. Entering the palace, in a hall he found A multitude of foes, who gather'd round This mighty man, on every side engag'd Like bears bereaved of their whelps enrag'd. One finding such resistance where His mind, his weapons and his eyes Their boldness much his martial sprite provokes, And round he lays his deep inveterate strokes. Making his sword at each enforced blow Send great soul'd heroes to the shades below. But as when Hercules did undertake A doubtful combat with the Lernian snake, Fondly propos'd, if he cut off her head, The monster might with ease be vanquished. But when he the experiment did make, Soon to his hazard found his dear mistake, And that as often as he cut off one, Another instantly sprang in its room. After so many deaths and dangers past, Mason was thoroughly enflam'd at last: He snatch'd a blazing bavin with his hand, And fir'd the stately palace with the brand. And soon the towering and rapacious flame All hope of opposition overcame. Eurus and Notus readily subjoin Their best assistance to this great design; Drive pitchy flames in vast enfoldings down, And dreadful globes of fire along the town. And now the English army marched out, To hem this flaming city round about; That such as strived to escape the fire, Might by the fury of their arms expire. But O what language or what tongue can tell, This dreadful emblem of the flames of hell! No fantasy sufficient is to dream, A faint idea of their woes extreme. Some like unlucky comets do appear, Rushing along the streets with flagrant hair: Some seeking safety clamber up the wall, Then down again with blazing fingers fall. In this last hour of extremity, Friends and relations met in company; But all in vain, their tender sympathy Cannot allay, but makes their misery. The paramour here met his amorous dame, Whose eye had often set his heart in flame: Urg'd with the motives of her love and fear, She runs and clasps her arms about her dear: Where weeping on his bosom as she lies, And languisheth, on him she sets her eyes; Till those bright lamps do with her life expire, And leave him weltering in a double fire. The fair and beauteous bride, with all her charms, This night lay melting in her bridegroom's arms. This morning in his bosom yields her life, While he dies sympathizing with his wife. In love, relation, and in life the same, The same in death, both die in the same flame. Their souls united, both at once repair Unto their place appointed through the air. The gracious father here stood looking on His little brood with deep affection; They round about him at each quarter stands, With piteous looks, each lifts his little hands To him for shelter, and then nearer throng, Whilst piercing cries for help flow from each tongue. Fain would he give their miseries relief, Though with the forfeiture of his own life: But finds his power too short to shield off harms, The torturing flame arrests them in his arms. The tender mother with like woes opprest, Beholds her infant frying at her breast; Crying and looking on her, as it fries; Till death shuts up its heart affecting eyes. The conquering flame long sorrows doth prevent, And vanquish'd life soon breaks imprisonment. Souls leave their tenements, gone to decay, And fly untouched through the flames away. Now all with speed to final ruin haste, And soon this tragic scene is overpast. The town, its wealth, high battlements and spires, Now sinketh, weltering in conjoining fires. The general commands the officers with speed, To see his men drawn up and martialed: Which being done, they wheel the ranks, And kneeling down, to Heaven all gave thanks. By this Aurora doth with gold adorn The ever beauteous eyelids of the morn; And burning Titan his exhaustless rays, Bright in the eastern horizon displays; Then soon appearing in majestic awe, Makes all the starry deities withdraw; Veiling their faces in deep reverence, Before the throne of his magnificence. And now the English their red cross display, And under it march bravely toward the sea; There hoping in this needful hour to meet Ample provisions coming with the fleet. Meantime came tidings to Sasacus' ears, That Mistick town was taken unawares. Three hundred of his able men he sent, With utmost haste its ruin to prevent: But if for that they chance to come too late, Like harms on us they should retaliate. These, with loud outcries, met us coming down The hill, about three furlongs from the town; Gave us a skirmish, and then turn'd to gaze Upon the ruin'd city yet on blaze. But when they saw this doleful tragedy, The sorrow of their hearts did close their eye: Silent and mute they stand, yet breathe out groans; Nor Gorgon's head like this transforms to stones. Here lay the numerous bodies of the dead; Some frying, others almost calcined: All dolefully imprison'd underneath The dark and adamantine bars of death. But mighty sorrows never are content, Long to be kept in close imprisonment; When once grew desperate, will not keep under, But break all bands of their restraint asunder. And now with shrieks the echoing air they wound, And stamp'd and tore and curst the suffering ground. Some with their hands tore off their guiltless hair, And throw up dust and cinders in the air. Thus with strange actions and horrendous cries, They celebrate these doleful obsequies. At length revenge so vehemently doth burn, As caused all other passions to adjourn. Alecto raves and rates them in the ear, ‘O sensless cowards, to stand blubbering here! Will tears revive these bodies of the slain, Or bring their ashes back to life again? Will tears appease their mighty ghosts, that are Hoping to be revenged, hovering here? Surely expecting you will sacrifice To them the lives of those their enemies: And will you baffle them thus by delay, Until the enemy be gone away? O cursed negligence!’ And then she strips, And jirks and stings them with her scorpion whips; Until with anger and revenge they yell, As if the very fiends had broke up hell. That we shall die, they all outrageous swear, And vomit imprecations in the air: Then, full speed! with ejulations loud, They follow us like an impetuous cloud. Mason, to stop their violent career, Rallies his company anew to war; Who finding them within a little space, Let fly his blunderbusses in their face. Thick sulphurous smoke makes the sky look black, And heaven's high galleries thunder with the crack. Earth groans and trembles, and from underneath, Deep vaulted caverns horrid echoes breathe. The volley that our men first made, Struck down their stout file leaders dead. To see them fall, a stupifying fear Surpris'd and stop'd their soldiers in the rear: The numerous natives stop'd, and fac'd about; Whereat the conquering English gave a shout. At which they start, and through the forest scour, Like trembling hinds that hear the lions roar. Back to great Sasacus they now return again; And of their loss they thus aloud complain, ‘Sir, 'tis in vain to fight: The fates engage Themselves for those with whom this war we wage. We Mistick burning saw, and 'twas an awful sight; As dreadful are our enemies in fight: And the loud thunderings that their arms did make, Made us, the earth, yea heaven itself, to shake.’ Very unwelcome to Sasacus' ears Were these misfortunes, and his subject's fears: Yet to his men, the English he contemns, And threats to ruin us with stratagems. And now his thoughts ten thousand ways divide, And swift through all imaginations glide. Endless projections in his head he lays, Deep policies and stratagems he weighs. Sometimes he thinks, he'll thus the war maintain, Reviews the scheme, and throws it by again: Now thus, or thus, concludes 'tis best to do; But neither thus, nor thus, on the review. And thus his mind on endless projects wanders, Till he is lost in intricate meanders. At last gives up the case as desperate, And sinks, bewailing his forlorn estate. He and his people quite discouraged, Now leave their seats, and towards Monhattons fled. But in his way the English sword o'ertakes His camp, and in it sad massacres makes. Yet he escap'd, and to the Mohawks goes, Where he to them keeps reckoning up his woes: And they to cure the passions of his breast, Cut off his head, and all his cares released. MICHAEL WIGGLESWORTH. VANITY OF VANITIES. Vain, frail, short-liv'd, and miserable man, Learn what thou art when thy estate is best: A restless wave o' the troubled ocean, A dream, a lifeless picture finely dress'd. A wind, a flower, a vapor and a bubble, A wheel that stands not still, a trembling reed, A trolling stone, dry dust, light chaff and stubble, A shadow of something but truly nought indeed. Learn what deceitful toys, and empty things, This world, and all its best enjoyments be: Out of the earth no true contentment springs, But all things here are vexing vanity. For what is beauty, but a fading flower? Or what is pleasure, but the devil's bait, Whereby he catcheth whom he would devour, And multitudes of souls doth ruinate. And what are friends, but mortal men, as we, Whom death from us may quickly separate: Or else their hearts may quite estranged be, And all their love be turned into hate. And what are riches to be doted on? Uncertain, fickle, and ensnaring things; They draw men's souls into perdition, And when most needed, take them to their wings. Ah foolish man! that sets his heart upon Such empty shadows, such wild fowl as these, That being gotten will be quickly gone, And whilst they stay increase but his disease. As in a dropsy, drinking draughts begets, The more he drinks, the more he still requires; So on this world, whoso affection sets, His wealth's increase, increaseth his desires. Oh happy man, whose portion is above, Where floods, where flames, where foes cannot bereave him Most wretched man that fixed hath his love Upon this world, that surely will deceive him. For what is honor? What is sovereignty, Whereto men's hearts so restlessly aspire? Whom have they crowned with felicity? When did they ever satisfy desire? The ear of man with hearing is not fill'd; To see new lights still coveteth the eye: The craving stomach, though it may be still'd Yet craves again without a new supply. All earthly things man's cravings answer not, Whose little heart would all the world contain, (If all the world should fall to one man's lot,) And notwithstanding empty still remain. The eastern conqueror was said to weep, When he the Indian ocean did view, To see his conquest bounded by the deep, And no more worlds remaining to subdue. Who would that man in his enjoyment bless, Or envy him, or covet his estate, Whose gettings do augment his greediness, And make his wishes more intemperate. Such is the wonted and the common guise Of those on earth that bear the greatest sway; If with a few the case be otherwise, They seek a kingdom that abides for aye. Moreover they, of all the sons of men, That rule, and are in highest places set, Are most inclin'd to scorn their bretheren; And God himself (without great grace) forget. For as the sun doth blind the gazer's eyes, That for a time they nought discern aright: So honor doth befool and blind the wise, And their own lustre 'reaves them of their sight. Great are their dangers, manifold their cares, Through which, whilst others sleep, they scarcely nap, And yet are oft surprised unawares, And fall unwilling into envy's trap. The mean mechanic finds his kindly rest, All void of fear sleepeth the country clown: When greatest princes often are distress'd And cannot sleep upon their beds of down. Could strength or valor men immortalize, Could wealth or honor keep them from decay, There were some cause the same to idolize, And give the lie to that which I do say. But neither can such things themselves endure, Without the hazard of a change, one hour, Nor such as trust in them can they secure, From dismal days, or death's prevailing power. If beauty could the beautiful defend From death's dominion, then fair Absalom Had not been brought to such a shameful end: But fair and foul unto the grave must come. If wealth or sceptres could immortal make Then wealthy Crœsus, wherefore art thou dead? If warlike force, which makes the world to quake, Then why is Julius Cæsar perished? Where are the Scipios' thunder bolts of war? Renowned Pompey, Cæsar's enemy? Stout Hannibal, Rome's terror known so far? Great Alexander, what's become of thee? If gifts and bribes death's favor might but win, If power, if force, or threat'nings might it fray, All these, and more had still surviving been: But all are gone, for death will have no nay. Such is this world with all her pomp and glory; Such are the men whom worldly eyes admire, Cut down by time, and now become a story, That we might after better things aspire. Go boast thyself of what thy heart enjoys, Vain man! Triumph in all thy worldly bliss: Thy best enjoyments are but trash and toys, Delight thyself in that which worthless is. Omnia prætereunt præter amare Deum. THE DAY OF DOOM. Still was the night, serene and bright, When all men sleeping lay; Calm was the season, and carnal reason Thought so 't would last for aye. Soul, take thine ease, let sorrow cease, Much good thou hast in store: This was their song, their cups among, The evening before. Wallowing in all kind of sin, Vile wretches lay secure: The best of men had scarcely then Their lamps kept in good ure. Virgins unwise, who through disguise Amongst the best were number'd, Had clos'd their eyes; yea, and the wise Through sloth and frailty slumber'd. Like as of gold, when men grow bold God's threat'nings to contemn, Who stop their ear, and would not hear; When mercy warned them: But took their course, without remorse, Till God began to pour Destruction the world upon In a tempestuous shower. They put away the evil day, And drown'd their care and fears, Till drown'd were they, and swept away By vengeance unawares: So at the last, whilst men sleep fast In their security, Surpris'd they are in such a snare As cometh suddenly. For at midnight break forth a light, Which turn'd the night to day, And speedily an hideous cry Did all the world dismay. Sinners awake, their hearts do ache, Trembling their loins surpriseth; Amaz'd with fear, by what they hear, Each one of them ariseth. They rush from beds with giddy heads, And to their windows run, Viewing this light, which shines more bright Than doth the noonday sun. Straightway appears (they see 't with tears,) The Son of God most dread; Who with his train comes on amain To judge both quick and dead. Before his face the heavens gave place, And skies are rent asunder, With mighty voice, and hideous noise, More terrible than thunder. His brightness damps heaven's glorious lamps, And makes them hide their heads, As if afraid and quite dismay'd, They quit their wonted steads. Ye sons of men that durst contemn The threat'nings of God's word, How cheer you now? your hearts I trow, Are thrill'd as with a sword. Now atheist blind, whose brutish mind A God could never see, Dost thou perceive, dost now believe That Christ thy judge shalt be? Stout courages, (whose hardiness Could death and hell outface,) Are you as bold now you behold Your judge draw near apace? They cry, “no, no: alas! and wo! Our courage is all gone: Our hardiness (fool hardiness) Hath us undone, undone.” No heart so bold, but now grows cold And almost dead with fear: No eye so dry, but now can cry, And pour out many a tear. Earth's potentates and powerful states, Captains and men of might, Are quite abash'd, their courage dash'd At this most dreadful sight. Mean men lament, great men do rent Their robes, and tear their hair: They do not spare their flesh to tear Through horrible despair. All kindreds wail: all hearts do fail: Horror the world doth fill With weeping eyes, and loud outcries, Yet knows not how to kill. Some hide themselves in caves and delves In places under ground: Some rashly leap into the deep, To 'scape by being drown'd: Some to the rocks (O senseless blocks!) And woody mountains run, That there they might this fearful sight, And dreaded presence shun. In vain do they to mountains say, Fall on us and us hide From judge's ire, more hot than fire, For who may it abide? No hiding place can from his face, Sinners at all conceal, Whose flaming eye hid things doth spy, And darkest things reveal. Then were brought in, and charg'd with sin. Another company, Who by petition obtain'd permission, To make apology: They argued, “We were misled, As is well known to thee, By their example, that had more ample Abilities than we: Such as profess'd they did detest And hate each wicked way: Whose seeming grace whilst we did trace, Our souls were led astray. When men of parts, learning and arts. Professing piety, Did thus and thus, it seem'd to us We might take liberty. The judge replies, “I gave you eyes, And light to see your way, Which had you lov'd, and well improv'd, You had not gone astray. My word was pure, the rule was sure, Why did you it forsake, Or thereon trample, and men's example, Your directory make? This you well knew, that God is true, And that most men are liars, In word professing holiness, In deed thereof deniers. O simple fools! that having rules Your lives to regulate, Would them refuse, and rather choose Vile men to imitate.” “But Lord,” say they, “we went astray, And did more wickedly, By means of those whom thou hast chose Salvation heirs to be.” To whom the judge; “what you allege, Doth nothing help the case; But makes appear how vile you were, And rendereth you more base. You understood that what was good Was to be followed, And that you ought that which was naught To have relinquished. Contrary ways, it was your guise, Only to imitate Good men's defects, and their neglects That were regenerate. But to express their holiness, Or imitate their grace, You little car'd, nor once prepar'd Your hearts to seek my face. They did repent, and truly rent Their hearts for all known sin: You did offend, but not amend, To follow them therein.” “We had thy word,” say some, “O Lord, But wiser men than we Could never yet interpret it, But always disagree. How could we fools be led by rules, So far beyond our ken, Which to explain did so much pain, And puzzle wisest men.” “Was all my word abstruse and hard?” The judge then answered: “It did contain much truth so plain, You might have run and read. But what was hard you never car'd To know nor studied. And things that were most plain and clear You never practised. The mystery of piety God unto babes reveals; When to the wise he it denies, And from the world conceals. If to fulfil God's holy will Had seemed good to you You would have sought light as you ought, And done the good you knew.” Then at the bar arraigned are An impudenter sort, Who to evade the guilt that's laid Upon them thus retort; “How could we cease thus to transgress? How could we hell avoid, Whom God's decree shut out from thee, And sign'd to be destroy'd? Whom God ordains to endless pains, By law unalterable, Repentance true, obedience new, To save such are unable: Sorrow for sin, no good can win, To such as are rejected: Nor can they grieve, nor yet believe, That never were elected. Of man's fall'n race who can true grace Or holiness obtain? Who can convert or change his heart, If God withhold the same? Had we applied ourselves and tried As much as who did most God's love to gain, our busy pain And labor had been lost. Christ readily makes this reply; “I damn you not because You are rejected or not elected, But you have broke my laws: It is but vain your wits to strain The end and means to sever: Men fondly seek to part or break What God hath link'd together. Whom God will save such will he have The means of life to use: Whom he'll pass by, shall choose to die, And ways of life refuse. He that foresees, and foredecrees, In wisdom order'd has, That man's free will electing ill, Shall bring his will to pass. High God's decree, as it is free, So doth it none compel Against their will to good or ill, It forceth none to hell. They have their wish whose souls perish With torments in hell fire, Who rather chose their souls to lose, Than leave a loose desire. Then to the bar, all they drew near Who died in infancy, And never had or good or bad Effected personally, But from the womb unto the tomb Were straightway carried, (Or at the last ere they transgress'd) Who thus began to plead: “If for our own transgression, Or disobedience, We here did stand at thy left hand, Just were the recompense: But Adam's guilt our souls hath spilt, His fault is charged on us; And that alone hath overthrown, And utterly undone us. Not we, but he ate of the tree, Whose fruit was interdicted: Yet on us all of his sad fall, The punishment 's inflicted. How could we sin that had not been, Or how is his sin our Without consent, which to prevent, We never had a power? O great Creator, why was our nature Depraved and forlorn? Why so defil'd, and made so vild Whilst we were yet unborn? If it be just and needs we must Transgressors reckon'd be, Thy mercy, Lord, to us afford, Which sinners hath set free. Behold we see Adam set free, And sav'd from his trespass, Whose sinful fall hath split us all, And brought us to this pass. Canst thou deny us once to try, Or grace to us to tender, When he finds grace before thy face, That was the chief offender?” Then answered the judge most dread, “God doth such doom forbid, That men should die eternally For what they never did. But what you call old Adam's fall, And only his trespass, You call amiss to call it his, Both his and yours it was. He was design'd of all mankind To be a public head, A common root, whence all should shoot, And stood in all their stead. He stood and fell, did ill or well, Not for himself alone, But for you all, who now his fall And trespass would disown. If he had stood, then all his brood Had been established In God's true love never to move, Nor once awry to tread: Then all his race, my Father's grace, Should have enjoy'd for ever, And wicked sprites by subtle sleights Could then have harmed never. Would you have griev'd to have receiv'd Through Adam so much good, And had been your for evermore, If he at first had stood? Would you have said, ‘we ne'er obey'd, Nor did thy laws regard; It ill befits with benefits, Us, Lord, so to reward.’ Since then to share in his welfare, You could have been content, You may with reason share in his treason, And in the punishment. Hence you were born in state forlorn, With nature so deprav'd: Death was your due, because that you Had thus yourselves behav'd. You think, ‘if we had been as he, Whom God did so betrust, We to our cost would ne'er have lost All for a paltry lust.’ Had you been made in Adam's stead, You would like things have wrought, And so into the selfsame wo, Yourselves and yours have brought. I may deny you once to try, Or grace to you to tender, Though he finds grace before my face, Who was the chief offender: Else should my grace cease to be grace; For it should not be free, If to release whom I should please, I have no liberty. If upon one what's due to none I frankly shall bestow, And on the rest shall not think best, Compassion's skirts to throw, Whom injure I? will you envy, And grudge at others' weal? Or me accuse, who do refuse Yourselves to help and heal. Am I alone for what's my own, No master or no Lord? O if I am, how can you claim What I to some afford? Will you demand grace at my hand, And challenge what is mine? Will you teach me whom to set free, And thus my grace confine? You sinners are, and such a share As sinners may expect, Such you shall have; for I do save None but my own elect. Yet to compare your sin with their Who liv'd a longer time, I do confess yours is much less, Though every sin's a crime. A crime it is, therefore in bliss You may not hope to dwell But unto you I shall allow The easiest room in hell.” The glorious king thus answering, They cease, and plead no longer: Their consciences must needs confess His reasons are the stronger. Thus all men's pleas the judge with ease Doth answer and confute. Until that all, both great and small, Are silenced and mute. Vain hopes are crop'd, all mouths are stop'd, Sinners have nought to say, But that 'tis just, and equal most They should be damn'd for aye. Now what remains, but that to pains And everlasting smart, Christ should condemn the sons of men, Which is their just desert; Oh rueful plights of sinful wights! Oh wretches all forlorn: 'T had happy been they ne'er had seen The sun, or not been born. The saints behold with courage bold, And thankful wonderment, To see all those that were their foes Thus sent to punishment: Then do they sing unto their king A song of endless praise: They praise his name and do proclaim That just are all his ways. Thus with great joy and melody To heaven they all ascend, Him there to praise with sweetest lays, And hymns that never end. Where with long rest they shall be blest, And nought shall them annoy: Where they shall see as seen they be, And whom they love enjoy. BENJAMIN COLMAN. ON ELIJAH'S TRANSLATION, Occasioned by the death of the reverend and learned Mr Samuel Willard. I sing the man, by heaven's peculiar grace, The prince of prophets, of the chosen race, Rais'd and accomplish'd for degenerate times, To stem the ebb with faith and zeal sublime; T' assert forsaken truth, to check the rage Of rampant vice, and cure a wicked age. Such times need such a prophet,—in his death Is quench'd the light of Israel, and their breath. Plain was the saint, his soul by grace refin'd, His girdle mean, but much adorn'd his mind: In face, as well as mind, above the toys Of this vain world, and all its sensual joys: Simple in diet, negligent of dress, Hairy and rough his robe, meet to express One mortify'd to things of time and sense, To truth and things divine a love intense. Jealous for Israel and the Lord of hosts, Disdain'd to see Him rival'd by a post, Mourn'd his forsaken covenant, and worship lost. Courageous, dar'd alone to stand the shock, Of numerous priests of Baal and to deride their stock. Fac'd fierce tyrannous powers, told their crimes And shames deserv'd the judgments of their times. His and truth's triumphs glorious: strange to say! A debauch'd nation convert in a day, And sham'd, enrag'd imposters fled away! A wondrous saint; inspir'd, employ'd and led By heavenly love; by many wonders fed. The care of heaven, the darling of his God, Signally sav'd, cheer'd by His staff and rod. Voracious ravens yield him up their prey: Glad angels to his succor wing away: And heaven, to show its empire more, commands Hopeless relief from famishing widow's hands. He pray'd, the sealed heavens withheld their rain; He pray'd, the open'd clouds discharge again. Provok'd he ask'd; strange blazing showers of flame Stream down, and Sodom's day renewed came. He struck the floods,—the refluent waves divide; His mantle's breath drove back the flowing tide. What ail'd thee, O astonish'd sea, to fly? Jordan! from Joshua's days thy banks not dry! Yet greater wonders view: he spake,—the dead In sin, or grave, lift up their fallen head: Witness the happy mother, fully won To heaven as she receiv'd her raised son: Blest work of grace! the mercy of the mean Illustrious, as the saving change is seen. Not less miraculous the prophet's fast, Labors and travels gloriously surpass'd: His strength and application, as his trust, Noble and vast, angelic and august: In public toils consum'd, of life profuse, Exhausted in retired holy muse, On the deep things of God, and mysteries abstruse. Such labors bounteous heaven is wont to crown With heavenly visions, light and joys unknown. So heavenly glories dazzled Moses' eyes, And laboring Paul was caught to paradise. No less Elijah to his Saviour dear, No less his cares and toils, his prayers and tears; Nor less would heaven his suff'ring soul to cheer. The God of Israel pass'd before the cave, In majesty, as erst the law he gave, And frighten'd nature seem'd to seek a grave. Tempests, and flames, and earthquakes march'd before, Speaking the terrors of almighty power; These usher'd in the small still voice of grace; His soul grew calm, serene the troubled place; Hush'd as the winds were all his boisterous fears, The humble saint, call'd forth by God, appears; With mantle wrapt about his face he stood, Afraid to hear, nor wish'd to see his God. Yet lest the hero as his God we show, Or he elate with visions, vain should grow, At times his passions did the man betray, That saints have sin, and prophets are but clay. Too timorous, 'midst his triumphs; left to fly A woman's rage and threats, and wish to die. Desponding moan'd Christ of his church bereft, And not a single saint in Israel left. All to hide pride from man, to show how vain We are at best, and undue thoughts restrain. God is the light, in whom's no shade at all, To him in prostrate adorations fall. Created brightness ever has its blots, And even Persia's idol has its spots. Yet admiration, reverence and love Are due to saints on earth, or those above. Sure the curst spirit that hates is born of hell, Nor is less monster then foul Jezebel: She murd'rous sought his blood: Ahab his name (Dearer than life) with slanderous lies defames: And both invet'rate hate, and deadly war proclaim. Yet spite of envy, spite of malice curst, Virtue shall live: see, bloated fiend, and burst! See the fair name immortal in my verse! See the strew'd glories on the hero's hearse! A name embalm'd shall be the just man's lot, While vicious teeth shall gnash, and names shall rot. Return, my muse, and sing his faithful care, And noblest trust, in happy Bethel's chair. Hail, venerable seat! from Jacob's days Sacred to Israel's God, and to his praise! Blest evermore with visions! the resort Of holy angels! heaven's inferior court! Hail dreadful place! the Eternal's blest abode! The gate of heaven, and the house of God! Here stood the spacious college, Israel's pride: And here the illustrious seer did preside. Stately the dome, worthy the beauteous train, Religion pure devoted to maintain, And to the age to come the laws divine explain. Richly endow'd by every pious zeal, Studious of Zion's glory and her weal: Blest tribute! dear to heaven: a pious aid Given to Christ, and liberally repaid In richer blessings to the church and state; So he returns us what we consecrate. Hence Israel's chiefs, and hence our teachers came; Hence truth and grace, hence issued light and flame; Hence men renown'd, and of celebrious fame. Micaiah one: from foul illusion free, Faithful to God, and Ahab true to thee! Kings trembled as he spake, and homage paid, Of truth and the superior man afraid. Elisha too, to greater glories born, Was hence: and high exalted is his horn! These beauteous sons were the blest prophet's pride, Under his wing they bloom'd, and flourish'd by his side; Paid him a reverence profound and true, To heaven's election, Israel's suffrage due. Them, as by office bound, he did inspect, Taught heavenly truth, and errors did correct: Cherish'd the good, and form'd their manners well, But search'd out vice, th' infection to expel. Meek and majestic, affable and grave, Lowly and good; and all that's great and brave, He overaw'd and charm'd: base hearts he won, And perfected where goodness was begun. To them, his lectures on the holy law, Sublime they were, new mysteries they saw: Like him with heavenly light and joys inspir'd, Their ravish'd minds the sacred deeps admir'd. They saw the promised Messiah's days, And the glad schools resounded with his praise. They sang the Baptist in their prophet's spirit, And bless'd the saint elect that should inherit. They sang of the transfigur'd Saviour's rays, What favorite saints from heaven itself to gaze On glories yet unknown; and talk of high Mysterious truths; into which angels pry, And pass in transports immortality. They sang his high ascent, and gifts ineffable, The cloven tongues of fire on Pentecost that fell, And what great type should all these wonders figure and foretel. Thus taught, they waited long the great event, Foresaw the day, amaz'd at the portent: Stupendous grace and power they view'd, ador'd The sov'reign God, and pry'd into his word. And now the saint had his last visit made, His solemn charge, and final blessing said. His weeping sons receiv'd his last adieu, With eager eyes their breath departing view, And following far behind to Jordan's brink they drew. Each emulous to succeed, but well prepar'd To welcome him whom heaven had heir declar'd. Elisha he! The wisdom of the choice Applauded with united hearts and voice. Unenvy'd in the schools, had long outshone In gifts divine, and rival there was none. Glorious the seer's fidelity was here, And heaven's good conduct splendid did appear. Nor blood, nor name, his upright zeal retard, God's choice and will he simply did regard; Whom heaven accomplishes it will reward. The happy youth cleav'd to his father's feet, Minist'ring to him with a duty meet; From his oraculous lips ask'd counsel sage, And had the prayers and blessings of his age. Yet there remain'd the last and dying bequest, And the wise son had ready his request. “Say, now at parting, what I shall bequeath!” Trembling he fell the prophet's feet beneath, Grieved to part, afraid to speak his thought, Conscious how vast the blessing was he sought: With mouth in dust he said,—“May I inherit A double portion of thy blessed spirit! O might my last and highest wish have place, An em'nent measure of thy gifts and grace!” Divine ambition! to be wise and good! So he his fame and interest understood. Modest his wish, he only ask'd a part, And heaven gave all, even an equal heart: Obvious the truth from sacred record known, None came so near Elijah as his wondrous son. 'T was at high noon, the day serene and fair, Mountains of lum'nous clouds roll'd in the air, When on a sudden, from the radiant skies, Superior light flash'd in Elisha's eyes: The heavens were cleft, and from th' imperial throne A stream of glory, dazzling splendor shone: Beams of ten thousand suns shot round about, The sun and every blazon'd cloud went out: Bright hosts of angels lin'd the heavenly way, To guard the saint up to eternal day. Then down the steep descent, a chariot bright, And steeds of fire, swift as the beams of light. Wing'd seraphs ready stood, bow'd low to greet The fav'rite saint, and hand him to his seat. Enthron'd he sat, transform'd with joys his mein, Calm his gay soul, and like his face serene. His eye and burning wishes to his God, Forward he bow'd, and on the triumph rode. Saluted, as he pass'd the heavenly cloud, With shouts of joy, and hallelujahs loud. Ten thousand thousand angel-trumpets sound, And the vast realms of heaven all echo'd round. They sang of greater triumphs yet to come, Their next descent to wait the Saviour home: And the glad errand of the final day, The raised dust of saints to bring away In equal triumph, and in like array. Thus 'midst inspir'd, sublime, prophetic songs, (Sweet melody,) the vision pass'd along. The prince of air accurs'd fled swift the light, And heavenly sounds, more grating than the sight; Blasphem'd, and rag'd, and gnash'd in furious spite, Elisha saw: “My father,” loud he cried, “My father! Israel's safety! and her pride! More wert thou our defence and glory far, Than all our chariots and strong troops of war. Thy prayers and power with God did more secure Our tott'ring state, and naked coasts immure, Than all our arms.”— He said: nor more could see: immense the space! The flying glory now had gain'd the place Of light, ne'er to be seen by mortal eye: No longer gaz'd he on the closing sky. With anguish seiz'd his goodly robes he rent, Himself, the church, and schools did sore lament. The prophet's bliss could not his tears restrain, He wept their loss, in his eternal gain. Nor yet in useless tears stay'd he to vent His mighty griefs, on greater things intent: The mantle fall'n with joy surprising spy'd, Laid the dear pledge close to his panting side; Sovereign receipt! his fainting heart reviv'd, By it install'd in the blest Prophet's place! With it receiv'd his spirit and his grace! The sacred banner flying in his hand, Display'd his empire, on the distant strand; Nature obsequious, to his dread command. Triumphant-wise, the pensive conqueror stood, The precious relic wav'd, and smote the flood: “Where is the Lord, Elijah's God?” he cry'd. Th' obedient waves again in haste divide. He pass'd: the ravish'd Prophets saw: confess'd The miracle of grace, and thankful bless'd Th' Eternal Spirit, and his glorious rest. O'erjoy'd they ran the saint elect to meet, And bow beneath the bright successor's feet. They breathe their prayers and blessings in his arms, Cheer his sad soul, and their own passions charm. Their hearts within 'em glow, their graces burn; Each speak mysterious oracles in their turn: Inspired their mind, transform'd their very mien, In both superior grace and beauty seen. In holiness and truth sweet their accord, And faith their consolation did afford, Elijah's more illustrious second coming with his Lord. JANE TURELL. A PARAPHRASE OF THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-FOURTH PSALM. As on the margin of Euphrates' flood We wail'd our sins, and mourn'd an angry God; For God provoked, to strangers gave our land, And by a righteous Judge condemn'd we stand; Deep were our groans, our griefs without compare, With ardent cries we rent the yielding air. Borne down with woes no friend at hand was found, No helper in the waste and barren ground: Only a mournful willow wither'd there, Its aged arms by winter storms made bare; On this our lyres, now useless grown, we hung, Our lyres by us forsaken and unstrung! We sigh'd in chains, and sunk beneath our wo, Whilst more insulting our proud tyrants grow. From hearts oppress'd with grief they did require A sacred anthem on the sounding lyre: Come, now, they cry, regale us with a song, Music and mirth the fleeting hours prolong. Shall Babel's daughter hear that blessed sound? Shall songs divine be sung in heathen ground? No, Heaven forbid that we should tune our voice, Or touch the lyre! whilst slaves we can't rejoice. O Palestina! our once dear abode, Thou once wert blest with peace, and loved by God! But now art desolate, a barren waste, Thy fruitful fields by thorns and weeds defaced. If I forget Judea's mournful land, May nothing prosper that I take in hand! Or if I string the lyre, or tune my voice, Till thy deliverance cause me to rejoice; O may my tongue forget her art to move, And may I never more my speech improve! Return, O Lord! avenge us of our foes, Destroy the men that up against us rose: Let Edom's sons thy just displeasure know, And, like us, serve some foreign conquering foe In distant realms; far from their native home, To which dear seat O let them never come! Thou, Babel's daughter! author of our wo, Shalt feel the stroke of some revenging blow: Thy walls and towers be levell'd with the ground, Sorrow and grief shall in each soul be found: Thrice blest the man, who, that auspicious night, Shall seize thy trembling infants in thy sight; Regardless of thy flowing tears and moans, And dash the tender babes against the stones. Her father says of this Paraphrase, “The serious melancholy Psalm is well turned in the most parts of it, considering your years and advantages for such a performance. You speak of a single withered willow which they hung their harps on; but Euphrates was covered with willows along the banks of it, so that it has been called the River of Willows. I hope, my dear, your lyre will not be hung on such a sorrowful shrub. Go on in sacred songs, and we'll hang it on the stately cedars of Lebanon. Or let the pleasant elm before the door where you are suffice for you.” TO MY MUSE. Come, gentle muse, and once more lend thine aid, O bring thy succor to a humble maid! How often dost thou liberally dispense To our dull breast thy quick'ning influence! By thee inspired, I'll cheerful tune my voice, And love and sacred friendship make my choice. In my pleased bosom you can freely pour, A greater treasure than Jove's golden shower. Come now, fair muse, and fill my empty mind, With rich ideas, great and unconfin'd. Instruct me in those secret arts that lie Unseen to all but to a poet's eye. O let me burn with Sappho's noble fire, But not like her for faithless man expire. And let me rival great Orinda's fame, Or like sweet Philomela's Philomela was the name on the title page of Miss Singer's poems. Mr Colman, it seems, had not forgotten to discourse to his daughter of the fair maid of Bath. be my name. Go lead the way, my muse, nor must you stop Till we have gain'd Parnassus' shady top: Till I have view'd those fragrant soft retreats, Those fields of bliss, the muses' sacred seats. I'll then devote thee to fair virtue's fame, And so be worthy of a poet's name. ON THE POEMS OF SIR RICHARD BLACKMORE. Blackmore, thou wondrous bard! whose name inspires My glowing breast to imitate thy fires, O that my muse could give a lasting fame! Then should my verse immortalize thy name. Thy matchless lines thy inborn worth displays, Inspires our souls, and fills our mouths with praise. Thou for mankind's preceptor Heaven design'd, To form their manners, and instruct their mind. In virtue's cause undaunted you engage, To stem the tide of vice, reform the stage, And place the present with the golden age. What eyes can view thy heroes, and not find In them the lively copy of thy mind? None but a soul profusely great and good, A soul with every princely gift endow'd, Could draw such virtues in their native light; Virtues in which heroic souls delight. With what sweet majesty Eliza stands, While valiant Vere attends her high commands? The vanquish'd Gauls before her cohorts fly, And with their blood the Danube's current dye. Here pious Arthur ploughs the watery main, Heaven's righteous cause and worship to maintain; His pious deeds and his victorious arms Are crown'd with peace, and Ethelina's charms. The virtuous Alfred next imbark'd we find, In quest of wisdom for a princely mind, To empire born and for a throne design'd. Sages and kings alike the prince admire, The schools and courts yield him his whole desire: His virtue, faithful Guithun, was thy care; Nobly he fled the lewd Sicilian fair! Chaste he return'd, and as an angel wise, And more than crowns he found in fair Elsitha's eyes. Thus Arthur, Alfred, and Eliza stand, Drawn for examples by your matchless hand. Had but the Mantuan felt that heavenly fire, That warms thy breast, whene'er you tune the lyre, Rome ne'er had known a rival in her praise, Nor to Augusta e'er resign'd the bays. To sacred numbers next your lyre is strung, And mysteries divine flow from your tongue. What heart's not sad, what eye flows not with tears, When Job in all the pomp of grief appears? His learned friends in vain attempt and try God's secret springs of acting to descry; And Job condemn, till God does justify. With Israel's Psalmist next in cheerful lays, Raptur'd in sacred love and heavenly praise, To Israel's God your purer offerings rise, For a sweet smell and grateful sacrifice. No more shall Epicurean doctrine find Belief in any but a sickly mind; Nor will the Stagyrite again persuade, 'Twas not in time these mighty orbs were made, Who read creation by your wit display'd. Nor the bold Arian, whose blasphemous breath The impure steam of sulphurous hell and death, Shall scan the Almighty's ways, his truths deny, And from the Saviour tear the Deity: No more shall he the gazing world delude, Nor on mankind his hellish schemes obtrude: While you Redemption sing our faith does cry, “My God, my God, I see thy deity!” O happy land! and of unrivall'd fame, That claims thy birth, and boasts so great a name! Albion alone is blest with such a son, A birth to ages past, and thee, O Greece, unknown. AN INVITATION INTO THE COUNTRY, IN IMITATION OF HORACE. From the soft shades, and from the balmy sweets Of Medford's flowery vales, and green retreats, Your absent Delia to her father sends And prays to see him ere the Summer ends. Now while the earth's with beauteous verdure dyed, And Flora paints the meads in all her pride; While laden trees Pomona's bounty own, And Ceres' treasures do the fields adorn, From the thick smokes, and noisy town, O come, And in these plains awhile forget your home. Though my small incomes never can afford, Like wealthy Celsus to regale a lord; No ivory tables groan beneath the weight Of sumptuous dishes, served in massy plate: The forest ne'er was search'd for food for me, Nor from my hounds the timorous hare does flee: No leaden thunder strikes the fowl in air, Nor from my shaft the winged death do fear: With silken nets I ne'er the lakes despoil, Nor with my bait the larger fish beguile. No luscious sweetmeats, by my servants plac'd In curious order e'er my table grac'd; To please the taste, no rich Burgundian wine, In chrystal glasses on my sideboard shine; The luscious sweets of fair Canary's isle Ne'er fill'd my casks, nor in my flagons smile: No wine, but what does from my apples flow, My frugal house on any can bestow: Except when Cæsar's birth day does return, And joyful fires throughout the village burn; Then moderate each takes his cheerful glass, And our good wishes to Augustus pass. But though rich dainties never spread my board, Nor my cool vaults Calabrian wines afford; Yet what is neat and wholesome I can spread, My good fat bacon and our homely bread, With which my healthful family is fed. Milk from the cow, and butter newly churn'd, And new fresh cheese, with curds and cream just turn'd. For a dessert upon my table's seen The golden apple, and the melon green; The blushing peach and glossy plum there lies, And with the mandrake tempt your hands and eyes. These I can give, and if you'll here repair, To slake your thirst a cask of Autumn beer, Reserv'd on purpose for your drinking here. Under the spreading elms our limbs we'll lay, While fragrant Zephyrs round our temples play. Retir'd from courts, and crowds, secure we'll set, And freely feed upon our country treat. No noisy faction here shall dare intrude, Or once disturb our peaceful solitude. No stately beds my humble roofs adorn Of costly purple, by carved panthers borne; Nor can I boast Arabia's rich perfumes, Diffusing odors through our stately rooms. For me no fair Egyptian plies the loom, But my fine linen all is made at home. Though I no down or tapestry can spread, A clean soft pillow shall support your head, Fill'd with the wool from off my tender sheep, On which with ease and safety you may sleep. The nightingale shall lull you to your rest, And all be calm and still as is your breast. JOHN ADAMS. ADDRESS TO THE SUPREME BEING, For his assistance in my Poetical Compositions. To Thee, great GOD! I lift my humble strains, My verse inspire; let judgment hold the reins, And curb my fancy's fierce unruly fire, Which else would, wild, to boundless flights aspire. May I not write too little, or too much, But paint with care, not with a hasty touch. May all my thoughts be rather just than high, And never let me rave when I should fly. But yet secure me from the low extreme, Of writing meaner than becomes my theme. Through all my works, let order clearly shine, And let me know the reason of each line. Give me to trace out nature in each thought, And let each piece be to perfection brought; A subject for my genius fit to choose, Not vainly light, nor yet profanely loose, But innocent, at least, if not sublime, And let my numbers smoothly flow in rhyme. May each production, writ with strength and ease, The ear, the judgment, and the fancy please. But if my soul, by a superior flame, Was never fir'd to merit lasting fame, Awaken'd, let me see my fond mistake, And with just anger from my folly break. Nor let me in the poet lose the priest, But know both what and when to write is best; From wasting, to redeem my vacant hours, And to refine the roughness of my powers. The brightest ancients let me read and know, And let their spirit in my numbers flow; And all the moderns, who, by thee inspired, Will be, as long as nature lasts, admired: By nobler patterns so to form my lays, As from the thinking few to merit praise. But most, dear God, assist my towering lyre, To sound thy name upon its trembling wire; Be thou the subject of my lofty verse, And, thine unbounded work, the universe: The streaming purple, gushing from his heart, Which made the Saviour's suffering soul depart. Doubly immortal, then, shall be my fame, Heaven shall contain my soul, and earth my name. [Version of the Apocalypse] The Sardian angel, Jesus bids attend, Before whose throne the radiant spirits stand And seven celestial lights adorn his hand. “Through the thin veil of thine hypocrisy I cast the flames of mine omniscient eye; The form that lives, and dazzles all around, Conceals a heart corrupt, a bleeding wound; Through which your dying grace shall soon be spent, Unless your care and penitence prevent. Few are your deeds, nor will those pious acts Atone the greater sum of your neglects. Past admonitions present to your fear, The lightnings seem to see, the thunders hear; Nor let the less'ning sounds die on your ear. Retain your former faith and former life, Or else expect my judgments like a thief, Shall steal in wrath on your unguarded hours, The bolts descending while the tempest pours: Too much like Sodom, Sardis has her lots, Whose shining garments are distain'd with spots. Their fairer vesture, whiten'd into snow, Shall o'er the flowery walks of Eden flow. The worthy victor shall be cloth'd in white; At once the garb of innocence and light; In heaven's fair books, in golden figures wrote, His name shall shine, nor endless ages blot. When heaven shall pour its angels all around, And all the dead shall live before the sound, And tribes unnumber'd circle round the king, His name shall glitter in the shining ring: The godlike man my Father, too, shall own, My lips acquit him, and my hand shall crown: Th' applauded saint, proclaim'd by every tongue, The saints shall shout, while angels give their song. Whose ears these counsels in attention bind, The same or greater happiness shall find. The Saviour holy, and the witness true, O Philadelphia's Guardian, writes to you. The scenes of joy and wo are in his hand Who doth the keys of life and death command; The gates of heaven, and hell's tremendous flame, These none can open, nor can shut but him. Thy power, in fiery persecutions show'd, Though small thy strength, the rage of hell withstood: Since in the storm thy growing courage rose, The opening hours shall smiling scenes disclose; Nor more shall shut by clouds of rising foes. The boasted Jews, who Satan's army meet, Shall own my love, and own it at your feet. On nations round, discharg'd from throne to throne, The storm shall fall, but fly from thee alone. When all the driving tempest roars around, The heavens serene and spotless will be found. Behold I come, with speedy vengeance come, Big with the joys of nations, or their doom: Then let thy faith and constancy prepare The golden crown and regal robes to wear. A victor then, the palm shall grace thy hand, And thou a pillar in the temple stand; Secure, sublime, and beauteous thou shalt rise To prop and grace the church within the skies. Thy vesture, too, the name of God shall wear, And that fair city, pendent in the air; The offspring of the skies, and modell'd there; And thy new title glitt'ring on thy vest, Shall join a dazzling lustre to the rest. Ye churches hear, and ponder what is said, For depths are here, and boundless fields are spread Laodicea, hear the great amen, For ever true his witness will remain; And rising at his word the world began: I know your works; in vain you would conceal Your dull indifference, and your languid zeal; Or throw aside the form, and show the cheat, Or let devotion raise a vital heat. As water which is free from each excess Breaks from the bosom which it did oppress; My vengeance shall your lifeless forms explore, And from my mouth the nauseous draught shall pour. As, when distraction seizes on the brain, The beggar with imagin'd wealth is vain; His treasures flow, and plenty crowns his board, He sees his servants, and he seems a lord; Naked, the purple vestments seem to wear, And every want is fled, and every fear; So, in the garments of affected pride, The poor and naked hypocrite is hid: Blind to himself, his fancy gilds the stains Which strike with horror, when his reason reigns. To me thy poverty and wants impart, My golden furniture shall grace thy heart: Nor snow can rival the celestial vest In which thy naked spirit shall be dress'd; Where every virtue shall attract the eye, And all the sister graces of the sky. Blind as thou art, my salve can give thee light, And pour the heavenly object on thy sight. Repent, and kindle up a vigorous zeal, Believe my mercy when my rod you feel. See where I stand, and wait your open breast, Not once invited, but a pleading guest! Happy the man who hears the welcome sound, The king shall enter; and, the table crown'd, Celestial dainties shall regale his mind; The food ambrosia, and the wine refin'd. Though vile the man, with freedom I will sup, The broken bread bestow, and purple cup. Soft on his ear my milky speech shall flow, As gentle showers, or drops of heavenly dew. Who gives his lord a kind reception here Shall, rapt to paradise, the bridal supper share. The christian hero, seated on a throne, Shall reign with me, and triumph in a crown. My sufferings gave the empire of the skies, And such as die like me, like me shall rise: Happy, whose pensive mind shall make him wise.” Now kindled, on the vacant fields of space, New shining worlds, and heaven renew'd its face; Earth, circling smooth, without an ocean rose, With hills unwrinkled and unclouded brows. The sacred city, modell'd in the sky, Shot in a trail of glory from on high; Till resting on the floating fields of air, Dress'd like a bride, it shone divinely fair. Then a loud voice a sacred seraph sent, Which rang through all th' extended firmament. “A God, a God! to dwell with men descends, See where his sparkling tent sublimely stands! His nation shall th' imperial city hold, And God shall lead them through the streets of gold; Wipe every tear from every flowing eye, And death shall from his courts for ever fly: And pensive moans, and silent grief and pain, And toilsome labor, sin's detested train; For every former shady scene is fled, And light, eternal, lifts its cheerful head.” Then spoke th' almighty Sire of endless days, Who sits enthron'd in light's severest blaze; “My forming word shall every thing renew, And let thy pen proclaim my sayings true. All things to a conclusion swiftly tend, But ne'er begun, my years can never end; The Alpha I, who spoke the birth of things, And the Omega who their period brings.” [Translation of an Ode of Horace] Mæcenas, whose ennobled veins The blood of ancient monarchs stains; My safeguard, beauty and delight. Some love the chariot's rapid flight, To whirl along the dusty ground, Till with Olympic honors crown'd: And if their fiery coursers tend Beyond the goal, they shall ascend In merit, equal to the gods, Who people the sublime abodes; Others, if mingled shouts proclaim Of jarring citizens their name, Exalted to some higher post, Are in the clouds of rapture lost. This, if his granary contain In crowded heaps the ripen'd grain, Rejoicing his paternal field To plough, a future crop to yield; In vain his timorous soul you'd move Though endless sums his choice should prove, To leave the safety of the land, And trust him to the wind's command. The trembling sailor, when the blue And boisterous deep his thoughts pursue, Fearful of tempests, dreads his gain To venture o'er the threatening main: But loves the shades and peaceful town Where joy and quiet dwell alone. But when impatient to be poor, His flying vessels leave the shore. Others the present hour will seize, And less for business are than ease; But flowing cups of wine desire, Which scatter grief, and joy inspire; Joyful they quaff, and spread their limbs Along the banks of murm'ring streams, While trees which shoot their tow'ring heads, Protect them with their cooling shades. Some love the camp and furious war, Where nations, met with nations, jar; The noise of victors, and the cries Of vanquish'd, which assault the skies, While at the trumpet's piercing ring Their mounting spirits vigorous spring; When fainting matrons in a swound, Receive the martial music's sound. The morning hunter seeks his prey, Though chill'd by heaven's inclemency Forgets his house: with dogs pursues The flying stag in her purlieus. Or his entangling net contains The foaming boar in ropy chains. But me the ivy wreaths which spread Their blooming honors round the head Of learned bards, in raptures raise, And with the gods unite in praise. The coolness of the rural scenes, The smiling flowers and evergreens, And sportful dances, all inspire My soul with more than vulgar fire. If sweet Euterpe give her flute, And Polyhymnia lend her lute— If you the deathless bays bestow, And by applauses make them grow, Toward the stars my winged fame Shall fly, and strike the heavenly frame. JAMES RALPH. ZEUMA, OR THE LOVE OF LIBERTY. FROM THE FIRST BOOK. Beyond the vast Peruvian realms, whose wealth Supports the Iberian throne, and freights whole fleets To Europe's hostile strand; a wond'rous ridge Of cumb'rous hills, vast, huge, and piled abrupt, Ascend above the clouds, and bound the view From sky to sky; aloft bleak winter holds Eternal reign, and from the mountain's brow, All cover'd o'er with ice, and white with snow, Looks hideous down, breathes out his chilling gales, And the sad wand'rer freezes to the ground, A ghastly statue, with the dread of death, Still graved upon his face; sometimes he bids The whirlwinds roar, and with destruction wing'd Impels it on the realms below, and oft, Assembling clouds on clouds, draws o'er the world A midnight darkness; and with sudden gush Pours down the rain in dreadful showers, and drowns The hope of harvest on the field. Where ends This rocky chain, succeeds a dreary length Of barren sands, torn up by every wind, And roll'd in heaps, like the vex'd billows On the stormy main: around, a frightful, wild, And horrid prospect, tires the lab'ring eye In gazing for its end. No vernal green E'er cheers the yellow waste; no bubbling spring Its cooling azure rolls along; no rains, Nor kindly dews refresh the burning soil: But nature looks as crumbled into dust; And ruin, sole possessor of the void. Yet on the sterile desert's utmost verge, And the rude mountain's skirt, the Spaniards found A land of plenty, where enlivening Spring And fruitful Autumn, with alternate change, Rejoiced the year; where wealth immense (the hope And end of all their execrable deeds,) Was found in earth's dark womb, and every joy Invited their abode. Such Peru was; And when, subjected to their arms, its tribes Became the vassals of their power, athwart This ridge of mountains they pursued Their way to conquest, and in Chili's realms, Resolved to fix their arbitrary rule, Though death in all its horrid forms opposed Their common toil, and not a soul return'd In safety from the war. There Zeuma reign'd, A prince, who in the opening bloom of youth, Preferr'd his country's welfare to his own. Once, as with ardent zeal he urged the chase, And press'd, with matchless swiftness, to secure His frighted prey, through the thick wood, from far He spied, low-bending o'er the limpid stream, An aged hermit; who seem'd wrapp'd in thought And solitary muse; behind him, arch'd By nature in the hollow rock, appear'd A gloomy cave, o'ergrown with moss, his calm Abode; above, with difficult ascent, Arose the hill, with vivid verdure crown'd; Around, the forest spread its grateful shade, And gently murmur'd to the gale; beneath, Spontaneous flowers adorn'd the grassy turf, And sweeten'd every breeze: long gazed the king On the enchanting scene, and wonder'd much It had till then escaped his haunt; when, waked By his approaching step, the father rose, And with meek rev'rence thus began. “'Tis not, Great prince, by accident you 've stray'd to this Sequester'd place, but by divine decree; That you may know what instant dangers threat Your rule, what miseries your realms; That no surprise enervate your resolves When war alarms you to the field; no dread Of stranger nations, or unusual arms Confuse the combat, and in foul retreat Disperse your routed squadrons o'er the plain.” He said, and led him, by a winding way, To the high brow of that delightful hill, And bid him view the prospect round. He look'd, And lo! the whole world's globe seem'd stretch'd along Before his view, so far the landscape reach'd, So many objects crowded on the eye; On this side cities stand, and forests wave, Green fields extend, and gentle rivers glide; O'erhanging precipices frown, and hills Ascend on high: on this the white sea foams, And on the nearer shores, with speedy roll, Breaks wide its hasty billows. Zeuma starts At the surprising roar, yet still intent, Beholds the restless wave, when, new and strange! High tossing on the angry surge appear Vast floating piles, that with capacious wings Collect the breathing gale, and by degrees Approach the strand; with thund'ring voice discharge Huge streams of ruddy flame, in cloudy smoke Involved, and fright the nations round. Again The monarch starts, astonish'd at the noise, While, down their steepy sides, descend a throng Of bearded men, of foreign look and mien; That brighten'd o'er the plain with shining arms, And all the pomp of war. To them succeeds An herd of creatures, fierce and active, train'd To battle, and the din of arms; on which The warriors mounting, all proceed, in firm And regular array, across the field; Then sound a charge; and o'er the tranquil glebe Let loose destruction, and with slaughter glut The sword; with dire oppressive force, and stern Dominion fix their barb'rous rule, and lord It o'er the groaning tribes. With horror struck, Sad Zeuma overlook'd the scene, and mourn'd The dire event: when thus the hoary sage His lore renew'd. “These are the foes that now Are marching to invade your land; and such The ills that must afflict your tribes; see o'er Yon ridge of hills, contemning all the force Of freezing cold, and wintry gales, they pass Unwearied with the toil: then haste away, Alarm your people, and with princely care Draw all your squadrons to the field. If aught Of doubt yet hangs upon your mind, Again survey the landscape, and believe My mission from above.” He look'd, and all Th' illusive prospect vanish'd from the view, And nought remain'd, but one vast length of wood, That murm'ring bow'd before the wanton gale. So, where the setting sun, with upward ray Adorns the evening clouds in fleecy gold, And purple deeply dyed, th' attentive eye, With wonder, views a maze of objects dawn In bright confusion o'er the blue sky's edge, And with a round of never ceasing change Perplex the doubtful scene, till night's deep shade, Ascending swiftly, darkens o'er the heavens, And in grey vapors sweeps the whole away. FROM THE THIRD BOOK. —He said; and, turning swiftly round, began His solemn charms; when sudden darkness veil'd The starry skies, and hollow murm'ring gales Sung dreadful in the trees; red meteors flash'd Along the troubled air; and, from beneath, Loud inbred thunders shook the steadfast earth; Unnumber'd ghosts, all pale with hostile wounds, Stalk'd o'er the green, and fill'd the night's dark gloom With ghastly terror and distracting groans: Silence succeeds, vanish the ghosts away, And earth no longer shakes; the lab'ring clouds Unveil'd the heavens, and, in their stony caves, The slumb'ring winds their weary pinions rest. Then sleep's still influence seized the drowsy king, And down he sunk, unable to resist The pressing weight of the prevailing god: But inspiration waked his inward powers, And roused light fancy, in her thousand forms, To strike the wond'rous vision on the mind. First his great father's shade, with glory crown'd, Descends, and, through the fluid realms of air, Bears the young monarch, swift as tempests fly When the grim ruler of the raging winds, Drives down their fury o'er the Atlantic seas, And, in a moment, to the farthest verge Of the vex'd ocean, heaps the roaring waves. The crystal gates of Cynthia's silver orb Unfold, and, up the portals' bright ascent, The rev'rend guardian leads his earthly charge Entranced in raptures; when the glorious scene, To his attentive view, unveil'd its charms: For there soft pleasures, in eternal rounds, For ever circle with an easy wing; All that the realms of either India boast, Or Afric's regions, or Europa's lands, By turns delight the happy tribes, and more, Ten thousand more, than man's experience knows, Or fancy forms, maintain eternal rule, And bless the immortals with continual joy. Music, through every shade sweet warbling breathes Soft gladness on the soul; the dulcet voice Attempers the respondent lyre. —Eternal verdure cheers the gladsome green, And odorous flowers, for ever blooming, wast Unfading sweets, and fume the wanton gale: From the slope hills, descend the trickling streams, And, through the fruitful vales, o'er sands of gold, In gentle currents, smoothly roll along; The mountain's brow with tufted woods is crown'd, With sparkling gems the silent grot's emblazed, And luscious plenty gladdens every field: No wintry snows, or summer suns infest The blissful climes, nor war's destructive rage Lays waste the regions, and deforms the plain; But heaven-born love and everlasting spring Dance hand in hand, and lead the smiling hours, All gay with newborn happiness and joy. Through spicy forests, and through flowery fields, The sweet abode of souls for ever bless'd! The princely ghost his raptured offspring led To that sublime retreat, where patriot shades, In matchless pleasures, and supreme delights, Enjoy the great reward their virtues earn'd, With long fatigue, and endless toils, below; There pointed, to his view, the illustrious chiefs, Who, scorning bribes, and all the baits of sense, Trod, with undaunted soul, the paths of death, When freedom claim'd the sword, and honor call'd to arms. Zymron, Kings of America famous for valor and virtue. the best, and bravest of mankind, Towers with superior glory, and presides Amidst the noblest heroes of the globe; Dreadless he looks, as when his rightful arms O'ercame the tyrants of an hundred realms, And made that bold attempt to free the western world. His mighty ancestor, of deathless name, The next in order treads the social green, Round his distinguish'd head bright virtue ties The laurel wreath, and glories in his deeds; Nations, preserved by his indulgent care, Shout his applause, and fame's eternal trump, Fill'd with his praises, shakes the tyrant's throne. Alascar, chief of Montezeuma's line, Stands at his side, severe his awful brow, As when, impartial to his country's laws, He doom'd his sons to ignominious death, And, in a patriot's zeal, restrain'd the parent's tears. The brave Atalgah, steadfast as the earth Pois'd on itself, and glorious as the sun In its meridian height, transported hears The wonders of his toilsome march rehearsed With loud acclaim, when, scorching in the heat, He patient bore the raging pangs of thirst, Till the last fainting soldier was refresh'd With frequent draughts from the enlivening spring. See! fair Amrena, with majestic front, And eye sublime, among the mightiest stand, Fond of the liquid death, which freed her soul From the proud insults of the victor's rage; Surrounding chiefs admire the heroic deed, And hail her dauntless mind which dared to lead An host to war, and, by the dint of sword, Restore lost freedom to her mourning realm. A thousand more, the champions of the world! Dwell here encircled with superior bliss, And dream of dangers and of toil no more. —“But now, descending to the seats of wo, And vengeful torments, where the sons of men Are rack'd for all the enormities of life, We for a while must leave these happy plains.” He said; and, plunging from the argent world, Sails on the winds, and bears his son along: At last upon a huge volcano's brink, With clouds of gloomy smoke involved, they stoop, And sink immediate down the vast profound; Nor stay'd till (through unnumber'd caverns pass'd, The abodes of fear, of horror and despair,) They reach'd the dreadful dungeons of the great. Where, bound in adamantine chains, they lie On beds of raging fire, and no hope Of comfort, or a kind reprieve from pain; From pain, which every hour increasing, gives A keener twinge; while fiercer flames prepare Their eager vengeance, and exert their rage; While round, the sad companions of their crimes, Condemn'd to endless woe, attend their lords, And aid the furies, and increase the fires. Indian tyrants.Here haughty Nimroc, plunged in burning lakes, And deeply drench'd beneath the sulphurous wave, No longer grasps at universal rule, Or wastes the nations with destructive arms; But, inly tortured with incessant pangs, Reflects with horror on his impious schemes. Fix'd in a ruddy car of burning steel, With sullen sadness, proud Guascara mourns His fond ambition to be thought a god, While, o'er the scorching soil, he 's dragged along, And scornful dæmons aggravate his wo, With pageant grandeur, and disdainful state. Tlaxcalla's A province bordering on Mexico. vaunt, great Zagnar's martial son, Extended on the rack, no more complains That realms are wanting to employ his sword; But, circled with innumerable ghosts, Who print their keenest vengeance on his soul, For all the wrongs, and slaughters of his reign, Howls out repentance to the deafen'd skies, And shakes hell's concave with continual groans. Ten thousand thousand more, whom fame records As the dread tyrants of the tortured globe, 'Midst the dire rigors of surrounding flames, Clank their huge fetters, and, with ceaseless yell, Bewail the frantic fury of their lives, Which forced down all the vengeance of the gods. This dreadful scene survey'd, again the ghost Broke the long silence, and his lore renew'd; “These, these are they, the execrable souls, Who vaunted heavenly birth, yet scorning truth, And virtue's sacred laws, acted worse deeds Than all the infernals could inspire; the worst, The basest of the sons of men, whose joy Was murther, whose delight was death, who thought. Mankind was destined only to adore Their transient glories, live upon their breath; Who laugh'd at justice, trampled on the laws, And gave whole armies to the rage of war! JOHN MAYLEM. THE CONQUEST OF LOUISBOURG. Not to Aonian spring, Parnassian mount, Famed Helicon, nor Aganippe's fount, For fancied fire, I aim the wonted flight, Nor yet explore Olympus' craggy height; Where fabled gods in famed assembly meet, Self-poised the globe, an atom at their feet— But to th' empyreal Throne, for solid rhyme, Address the Universal Cause sublime. O God! Immortal Deity—Supreme! Father of goodness! deign a heavenly gleam. Me with celestial ray benign inspire, And through each vein diffuse poetic fire! Æthereal vigor in each line display, While I the man and glitt'ring arms essay: Since Thou, great Parent, deign'd paternal aid, And terrible thy mighty power display'd. Heroic verse to noble deeds belong, Arms and the hero claim immortal song. These I attempt—but first the mighty cause, And bold infringer of establish'd laws— (How violate so beautiful a plan?) The peace of nature, and the tie of man. In that warm season of the rolling year, When fields begin fresh livery to wear, And the gay meads display their varied hue, With all green nature open to the view; 'Twas then the winding maze of vernal trees Deign'd a safe covert, and benignant breeze, To the fell savage; who in skulking mood Ranged the vast circuit of eternal wood, Through the meanders of the forest scour, And the long winding labyrinth explore: By Gallia won to fell Canadian rage With murd'rous shaft, to horrid deeds engage. Nor frontier village, garrison, or seat, But a dire ravage, or destruction meet. Where fathers stabb'd, and mothers in despair, With piteous shrieks, and cries, afflict the air, The brother, and fond sister meet in death, And hapless babes resign their infant breath. And now the drums beat up, and now appears With hearts elate, twelve thousand volunteers. Fired with ambition in their country's cause, Resolved to purchase fame, and loud applause, The ample sea-ports each assiduous man Their floating bulwarks for the mighty plan. The gather'd navy, glorious in her pride, In Plymouth's safe, capacious harbor ride. Till the fair summons of a genial breeze, Call forth to weigh, and cut the briny seas. Then for Cape Breton the Atlantic plough, While joy sat smiling on each martial brow, Urge their swift passage through the liquid green, Till all Britannia sinks behind the scene. The dancing castles, fann'd by easy gales, Hide half the circuit with their canvass sails. Thus forty days, the yielding deep explore, And reach at length Acadia's distant shore; Where generous Lawrence, with propitious sway, Harmonious, rules in peace the genial day; Whose fair metropolis, and growing town, By Halifax in Nova-Scotia's known. To a safe harbor bids the welcome fleet, And hails the heroes to his ample seat. A spacious basin now the fleet immure Where the tall navy rendezvous secure. See Amhurst now his warlike squadrons range, Portending dreadful death, and loud revenge. Forms his fierce legions in embattled ranks With van, and rear guard, and important flanks— Then at their head, heroic and serene, March'd like young Scipio to a bloodier scene, To a high battery, or winding length, Of double embrasures, of double strength, Whose mighty walls the enemy immure, And the long trenches, aid their great secure. Now o'er the heath his brave myrmidons leads, While the shrill music sounds to noble deeds, And the warm sunbeams on their firelocks play, Strike off in spires, and aid the blaze of day. A general halt ensues—nor yet the van Had the fierce onset of attack began, Six deep the front a martial grace disclose, That dared the thunder of their Gallic foes. But lo! while ready for the charge they stood, Death, blunderbuss, artillery, and blood! Blue smoke, and purple flame, around appear, And the hot bullets hail from front to rear. Tremendous fate by turns incessant flies, While the black sulphur clouds the azure skies. And ghastly savages, with fearful yell, Invoke their kindred of profoundest hell. Whose hoarse shrill powaws valiant Amhurst scorns, And roars loud thunder from his dread cohorns. Now, dire confusions on confusions rise, And the deep conflict aids the mighty noise. From hills of smoke see spire ascend on spire; And Amhurst there enveloped all in fire. With his drawn sabre from a livid cloud, With teeming death, emerging like a god! Ten thousand beams spire from the flaming steel, And Gallia's sons his weighty prowess feel. Now the vast tumult wakes the drowsy gods, Who all look down to see the mighty odds. When Amhurst there, like Peleus' mighty son, Dreadful in arms, and Tyrian scarlet shone, Engaging here, in martial order stood Fierce as Alcides or the Scythian god; Till thundering Mars no more the sight could bear, Turn'd pale with envy, and let drop his spear. And fame, all flaming from the imperial car, Hail'd him sole rival of the god of war. 'Twas such inspired immortal Maro's tongue, When Ilium's fate, “arms and the man” he sung. Thus the long conflict, undecided held, And each fierce veteran maintain'd the field. The conscious hero, thoughtful of our good, Fierce in the van, bespatter'd o'er with blood, With mien majestic, thrice his sabre shook, Thrice waved his arm, and thus, heroic, spoke. “Intrepid heroes—Britain's loyal band! Who valiant fought on this important land, In equal poise of this exploit th' event As yet hangs dubious—you fatigued and spent, Like valiant boys, give three huzzas and rush Victorious on—and give a final push.” He said—and swift as the revolving sun, Drove rapid through, and urged his passage on; While mighty Wolf, in terrible array, With dreadful phalanx, change the face of day; There sable chiefs and Gallic heroes yield, And vital carnage spreads the ample field. See! Whetmore, yonder, moving o'er the heath, Makes it one sad continued scene of death. Or, bending victor o'er the ample soil, Reaps a huge conquest with herculean toil. With Lawrence there, whose gen'rous bosom warms, And like Ascanius their enclosure storms. Of the deep trenches quick essays the verge, And deals wide slaughter with a heavy charge. Intrepid Frazer rushes impetuous on, Whose wielding broad-sword flames a circling sun. And Highland heroes charge their double flanks, Attack whole squadrons, and enclose their ranks. And Scott with ardor penetrates the wood, And sable warriors weep a vital flood; So a young lion with amazing dread, Strews the green covert with the passive dead. Opposed to where their famed asylum stood, Was a fair rising by a neighb'ring wood, An easy eminence, whose top accline, To their strong ramparts bore a level line. To this grand object of their martial scenes, Through fierce encounters move the huge machines. Now Wolf's long trenches and fascines appear, And conquer'd batteries ope each embrasure, With horrid mortars gaping on their tier, And the fix'd cannon point their fatal maws, While peals of thunder issue from their jaws. Boscawen now his naval vengeance hurls, And clouds of sulphur fleet away in curls; Intrepid Hardy, from his floating force, Wings fate on fate, with an incessant course, And brave Durell his keen combustions throw, While shells or break above or burst below. Thus long the sun in his diurnal race, Saw the dire conflict from his radiant space: When now a bomb of huge diameter, From a vast mortar, flamed a livid sphere, With dire combustion fill'd, and death innate, The last sad prelude to their final fate! Aloft in ambient ether now it spires, Strikes on the sunbeams, interchanging fires; Now prone inclines in terrible display, Like the last comet at the judgment day; On the French admiral, tremendous cracks, And swift as lightning drops beneath the decks. Meanwhile, alternate deaths promiscuous fly, And the fierce meteors blaze along the sky; Then shiver in the air, and sudden pour A cloud of atoms, in a sulphur shower; Or in their city wild convulsive burst Ten thousand ways, and mingle with the dust, A gaping chasm in their wall disclose, The reeking soldier at his death repose. While fate in showers of lead connected rains, And wings famed heroes to her dark domains; The cutting grape-shot spatter o'er the heath, And the fierce langrel aid the glare of death. In such sad scenes alternately involved, Till one fair season half her course dissolved; Too much the odds—the Gallic ensigns struck, By all their patron images forsook, With drooping flag and solemn pace advance, Their courage faints, nor more can stand the chance, The last sad purpose of their souls impart, And claim the mercy of a British heart. THOMAS GODFREY. THE COURT OF FANCY. 'Twas sultry noon,—impatient of the heat I sought the covert of a close retreat; Soft by a bubbling fountain was I laid, And o'er my head the spreading branches play'd; When gentle slumber stole upon my eyes, And busy fiction bid this vision rise. Methought I pensive, unattended, stood, Wrapp'd in the horrors of a desert wood; Old night and silence spread their sway around, And not a breeze disturb'd the dread profound. To break the wild, and gain the neighboring plain, Oft I essay'd, and essay'd oft in vain; Still in intricate mazes round I run; And ever ended where I first begun. While thus I laboring strove t' explore my way, Bright on my sense broke unexpected day: Retiring night in haste withdrew her shade, And sudden morn shone through the opening glade. No more the scene a desert wild appear'd, A smiling grove its vernal honors rear'd; While sweetness on the balmy breezes hung, And all around a joyful matin rung. Soft was the strain of Zephyr in the grove, Or purling streams that through the meadows rove. Now wild in air the varying strain is toss'd, In distant echoes then the sound is lost; Again revived, and lo! the willing trees Rise to the powerful numbers by degrees. Trees now no more, robb'd of their verdant bloom, They shine supporters of a spacious dome, The wood to bright transparent crystal changed, High fluted columns rise, in order ranged. So to the magic of Amphion's lyre Stones motion found, and Thebes was seen t' aspire; The nodding forests rose with the soft sound, And gilded turrets glitter'd all around: Each wond'ring god bent from his heavenly seat To view what powerful music could complete. High on a mountain was the pile disclosed, And spreading limes th' ascending walks composed; While far below the waving woods declined. Their verdant tops bow'd with the gentle wind. Bright varying novelty produced delight, And majesty and beauty charm'd the sight. Such are the scenes which poets sweetly sing, By Fancy taught to strike the trembling string. Here Fancy's fane, near to the blest abode Of all her kindred gods, superior stood. Dome upon dome it sparkled from on high, Its lofty top lost in the azure sky. By fiction's hand the amazing pile was rear'd, In ev'ry part stupendous skill appear'd; In beautiful disorder, yet complete, The structure shone irregular and great: The noble frontispiece of antique mould Glitter'd with gems, and blazed with burnish'd gold. Now through the sounding vaults, self-opening, rung The massy gates on golden hinges hung; All the bright structure was disclosed to view, Magnificent with beauty ever new! Trembling I stood absorb'd in dread surprise, And sudden glory dimm'd my aching eyes. Unnumber'd pillars all around were placed, Their capitals with artful sculpture graced. Wide round the roof a fictious sky was raised, A glorious sun in the meridian blazed, On the rich columns played his dazzling ray, And all around diffused immortal day; A shining phœnix on the effusive rays Fix'd his aspiring eye with steady gaze. Beneath appear'd a chequer'd pavement, bright With sparkling jaspanyx and chrysolite. Round, by creating Fiction's hand renew'd Gay visionary scenes in order stood; The obedient figures at her touch disclosed, And various tales the glowing walls composed. Here mighty Jove, amidst assembled gods, Raised on his starry throne, majestic nods; On his right hand the dreadful fates are seen, And on his left is placed his haughty queen. There the pale tyrant of the dreary coasts Sways with his powerful sceptre fleeting ghosts. Blue Neptune scours along his wat'ry reign, Now lifts the waves aloft, now stills the raging main. Perch'd on a lofty rock Æolus stands, And holds the winds in strong coercive bands. Here the bright queen of beauty stands confess'd, There angry Mars in martial honors dress'd. Alcides here appears with warrior pride, The lion's spoil descending o'er his side, The watchful dragon at his feet is lain, The Lernean Hydra and dire Centaurs slain. Here glows Diana, eager in the chace, And there Minerva shows with sober grace. There with the maddening rout close at his heels, Young Bacchus, jolly god, triumphant reels. Gay Maia's son, high mounted on the wind, Cuts through the air and leaves the clouds behind. Toward the rosy east, great Mithra shone, Bright in the glories of a rising sun. Beneath, in solemn pomp, with hands uprear'd, In flowing robes the Magi all appear'd; Here the sage Zoroaster. Bactrian poised his magic wand, Obedient Genii waited his command. There Thammuz lay, while from the gaping wound Pour'd the rich stream, and sanguined all the ground. Amidst his impious votaries Chemos stood, And horrid Moloch, smear'd with infant blood. Northward fierce Woden stood, with terrors crown'd, And angry Thor threw heedless thunder round. Fair Friga with her lovely train was seen, The beauteous rival of the Paphian queen. Old Merlin struck the lyre, the wond'ring throng Attended round to his prophetic song. Southward disorder'd figures struck my eyes, Monkeys and serpents raised to deities; Mad, superstitious Egypt these revered, And to the hideous tribe their prayers preferr'd. Maim'd Memnon there seem'd on his harp to play, And hail Osiris bringing on the day. Pale Isis' crescent faintly glimmer'd here, And barking Anubis display'd the year. Gay sportive fawns adorn'd the distant scene, In antic measures skipping o'er the green. There sea nymphs wanton'd on the wat'ry gleam, Rode on the waves, or cleaved the yielding stream. Here the pale Sybils ranged their mystic leaves, And Ætna with the laboring Cyclops heaves. There craggy rocks the sons of Titan tore, And mountains shaggy roots tremendous bore, And threaten'd Jove with the promiscuous war. Bold Phaeton here urged his mad request, Ambitious joy swell'd his presumptuous breast; Elate he mounted in the flaming car, The sire attended with a fix'd despair; Nor could the parent's tears the youth restrain, He laugh'd at fear, and daring took the rein. The fiery steeds his feeble hand despise, And stretch'd with glowing ardor through the skies; Now thunders roll'd, pale lightning play'd around, And the rash boy soon felt the burning wound. Pygmalion there the statue seem'd to move, Assisted by the powerful queen of love; With rapture fired, to his exulting breast The animated stone he fondly press'd; Transported on each shining feature gazed, Now soften'd into life, and saw amazed, Awaken'd into sense, her eye-balls roll, And heaving breasts bespoke the entering soul; Saw on her cheek the rosy tincture burn, And felt her lips the ravish'd kiss return. Famed Dædalus here wing'd the midway air, And sighing, saw his son disdain his care. Young Icarus on spreading pinions rose, And scorn'd the path his weary sire had chose: For heaven the aspiring boy his flight begun, But felt the ardor of too near a sun; The temper'd wax before the scorching ray Melted, and lo! the loosen'd wings gave way; And while his father's name his accents gave, Fell from the height, and sunk beneath the wave. Diana's rage there hapless Acteon feels, And saw his hounds pursuing at his heels; Changed to a stag, he swept along the plain, In vain his speed, he flew from death in vain. Elysium next disclosed its blissful bowers, With heavenly fruitage deck'd, and radiant flowers; Celestial Amaranth eternal bloom'd, And the bright plains with odorous scents perfumed; Through the gay meads an amber current roll'd, O'er sands resplendent as Arabia's gold, On whose green banks the happy shades reclined, Quaff'd its sweet stream, and left their cares behind. What ever dreamer dreamt, or poet sung, Or lying fable with her double tongue Told the believing world, now did appear Delusions all, for when approaching near, They shunn'd the view, and shrunk to empty air. High in the midst, raised on her rolling throne, Sublimely eminent, bright Fancy shone. A glitt'ring This conceit is occasioned, by the tiara's being a badge of royalty used in the east, and the oriental writers abounding much in pieces of imagination. tiara her temples bound, Rich set with sparkling rubies all around; Her azure eyes roll'd with majestic grace, And youth eternal bloom'd upon her face, A radiant bough, ensign of her command, Of polish'd gold, waved in her lily hand; The same the sybil to Æneas gave, When the bold Trojan cross'd the Stygian wave. In silver traces fix'd unto her car, Four snowy swans, proud of the imperial fair, Wing'd lightly on, each in gay beauty dress'd, Smooth'd the soft plumage that adorn'd her breast. Sacred to her the lucent chariot drew, Or whether wildly through the air she flew, Or whether to the dreary shades of night, Oppress'd with gloom she downward bent her flight, Or proud aspiring sought the bless'd abodes, And boldly shot among the assembled gods. On her right hand appear'd the joyful nine, And on her left the graces all divine; Young infant love soft on her breast reclined, And with his mother's glowing beauty shined. Her favorite sons were ranged in order round; In three bright bands with deathless laurels crown'd; Great Homer here enjoy'd superior day, Illuminated by bright fancy's ray; Apelles there, whose magic hand could give Form to the mass, and bid the fiction live; Timotheus next, whose animated lyre Cold grief could charm, and thoughtless rage inspire. Close at her feet a bard in raptures lost, Was placed, and wildly round his eyeballs toss'd; Great Fancy was the theme! the soothing train In floods of pleasure thrill'd through every vein. Thus, while the trembling notes ascend on high, He sung; “Indulgent queen of every joy, What rapture fills the breast thou dost inspire, The lover's transport, and the poet's fire! At thy command obedient pleasure bends, And rosy beauty to thy call attends; The fanning gales shall swelling spread thy fame, And echoing groves well pleased resound thy name!” While thus around my eyes I wildly threw, From charm to charm, and did each wonder view, Pleased on the heavenly ravishment to gaze, Rose with the strain, or wanton'd in the blaze! Her awful silence the bright goddess broke, And frowning, thus in angry mood she spoke: “Com'st thou, vain mortal, here with searching eye, Into the secrets of our court to pry? What rash presumption swells thy youthful breast, That in our presence thus you 've rudely press'd?” Trembling I kneel'd, with fear my tongue was tied A space, when speech regain'd, I thus replied: “With lowly reverence I hither came, Not to deride, but to adore thy name; To thee I ever dedicate my song, To hail thy glories 'midst this suppliant throng.” Then from her shining seat, the heavenly maid In beautiful arrision, answering said; “Then have thy wish—here, mortal, take this lyre, Strike bold the strings, and sing as I inspire. Humbly I bow'd, her mild commands obey'd, And careless o'er the lyre my fingers laid, And soon with wild poetic rage possess'd, All my frame shook, and laboring heaved my breast. By Fancy fired, enraptured thus I sung, Whilst all around redoubling echoes rung. “Zephyr attend, or whether through the grove Soft whisp'ring, you the leafy branches move, Or, shaking dulcet dew-drops from each flower, Wide through the plain you spread the fragrant shower, Or whether Sylvia, panting in some shade, In tender accents woos thee to her aid! No more in amorous sporting spend the day, No longer wanton on her bosom play; Fancy commands! obey the regal fair, Fancy commands! quick all your wings prepare! From the sun's early dawn till where again He sets his glories in the azure main; Through every clime her royal mandate bear, And bid mankind to her bright court repair. Hear, earth's inhabitants! ye mortals, hear! And let attentive wonder fix each ear. Fancy invites! nor let her ask in vain. Come, taste her heavenly sweets, and hail her reign!” Zephyr, obedient, on his wings convey'd The joyful summons warbling through the glade; Swiftly he swept along the spicy vale, Caught all its sweets, and in a balmy gale Gently he stole on the fond lover's ear, And in loud accents bade the warrior hear! From different climes the thronging nations came, And rush'd promiscuously before the dame; Prostrate before her throne their hands they rear, And to the goddess loud prefer their prayer. Confused, they all demand her promised joys, While the long vaults resound their clamorous noise. As when loud billows break upon the shore, Or o'er the opposing rocks the torrents roar. Her glittering branch impatient round she swung, And instant silence seized each babbling tongue. Abash'd they trembling stood, and seem'd to be Transfix'd in mute insensibility. Quick was dispersed each wild tumultuous sound, And the soft breezes all were hush'd around. Now swiftly forward false Delusion came, Wrapt in a fulvid cloud appear'd the dame. Thin was her form, in airy garments drest, And grotesque figures flamed upon her vest; In her right hand she held a magic glass, From whence around reflected glories pass. Blind by the subtle rays, the giddy croud Rush'd wildly from the dome and shouted loud. The few remain'd whom Fancy did inspire, Yet undeceived by vain Delusion's fire. A troop of shining forms the next came on, Foremost bright Nature's awful goddess shone. Fair Truth she led, in spotless white array'd, And pleasing Beauty, sweet celestial maid; Where Truth and Nature aid the great design, Beauty attends, and makes it all divine. Sweet Poesy was seen their steps behind, With golden tresses sporting in the wind; In careless plaits did her bright garments flow, And nodding laurels waved around her brow; Sweetly she struck the string, and sweetly sung, Th' attentive tribe on the soft accents hung. 'Tis hers to sing who great in arms excel, Who bravely conquer'd or who glorious fell; Heroes in verse still gain a deathless name, And ceaseless ages their renown proclaim. Oft to philosophy she lends her aid, And treads the sage's solitary shade; Her great first task is nobly to inspire The immortal soul with Virtue's sacred fire. Then Painting forward moved in garlands drest, The rainbow's varied tints adorn'd her vest. Great Nature's rival!—quick to her command Beauty attends, and aids her powerful hand. At her creative touch gay fictions glow, Bright tulips bloom, and opening roses blow. The canvass see, what pleasing prospects rise! What varying beauty strikes our wondering eyes! Chill winter's wastes, or spring's delightful green, Hot summer's pride, or autumn's yellow scene; Here lawns are spread, there towering forests wave, The heights we fear, or wish the cooling lave! Her blooming sister in her hand she led, Joy in her eye, fair Sculpture, heaven-taught maid. 'Tis hers to stone a mimic life to give, Heroes and sages at her call revive; See flowery orators with out-stretched hand Addressed to speak, in glowing marble stand! Sudden I heard soft sounds, a pleasing strain! Music advanced with all her heavenly train. Sweetly enraptured then my pulse beat high, And my breast glow'd, fraught with unusual joy. 'Tis harmony can every passion move, Give sorrow ease, or melt the soul to love; Exulting pleasure to her call attends, E'en stormy rage to powerful Music bends. With turrets crown'd bright Architecture shone. The lovely maid with easy steps came on; Graceful her mien, her looks celestial shined, Where majesty and softening beauty join'd. At her command see lofty piles ascend, Columns aspire, triumphal arches bend. Astronomy, with proud aspiring eye, Gazed on the glowing beauties of the sky. Her vest with glittering stars was spangled o'er, And in her hand a telescope she bore. With this she marked the rolling planet's way, Or where portentous comets dreadful stray. Though last, not least, Philosophy was seen: Slow was her step, and awful was her mien. A volume open in her hand she held; With nature's law the ample page was fill'd. 'Tis hers great Nature's wondrous depths t' explore, Or to the gods in heavenly rapture soar. With these bright Fancy's sons their hours employ, Pursue their lore, and taste each rising joy. Now suddenly the scene was changed again, And brought to view Delusion's spreading reign: There intermingled hills and rocks were seen, Here shady groves and flowery lawns between. Full in the front a lofty pile was rear'd, The architecture old and rude appear'd. Delusion's residence, within confined Gay fictions lurk, and dreams of every kind. Constant as waters roll, or flames ascend, Hither their course the rising vapors bend; Dress'd by her hand they shine with mimic bloom, Or at her word their nothingness resume. But still from Fancy all her power she draws, Bows to her name, and owns her sacred laws. Some in light dreams the sleeping senses move, And led by them the thoughts unsettled rove, Others, more bold, majestic portments take, And plague delighted those who dream awake. Such are the dreams of those who thirst for power, The superstitious, and a thousand more. Others usurp the features of the dead, And shake the torch around the murderer's bed; Affright the vigil, or in wanton mirth, Make fools seek hidden treasures in the earth, Or lead the weary traveller awry, Or rising, flame amazement in the sky. Now with the crowd Delusion forward came, A troop of phantoms flutter'd round the dame; In bands the throng she instantly divides, A phantom over every band presides. Foremost a bright majestic form appear'd, And in her hand the honor'd fasces rear'd; Forward she strode with more than virgin pace, And leer'd upon the crowd with haughty grace. Power was her name; assuming, selfish Pride And glittering Pomp attended by her side. Her favorite son on a high seat she placed, With mimic gems and glassy bawbles graced; Close by his side was seated wrinkled Care, While Envy view'd him with malicious stare: Sternly he eyed around the servile throng, While loud acclaim proceeded from each tongue; But from the giddy height devolving soon, Reproach, contempt, and shame is on him thrown. Eager another mounts the chair of power, And shines the empty pageant of an hour. Dame Superstition was the next came on, Bright on her head the gilded mitre shone, Varying her aspect, now she raised her eye, And seem'd bewilder'd with ecstatic joy; Then sudden gloom her countenance depress'd, Tears roll'd apace, and sorrow heaved her breast; Now calm again she silent view'd around The prostrate crowd bent humbly to the ground: Then, caught with sudden rage, she hurl'd about Her thund'ring anathema 'mong the rout. An aged, wrinkled hag the next appear'd, Four mouldering turrets o'er her temples rear'd; In rows like beads the faithful medals tied, In ornamental rust adorn'd her side. A broken column of an ancient date She dragg'd, and sinking seem'd beneath the weight. The column all admired, the medals more, “The inscription value, but the rust adore.” The next to her approach'd a reverent dame, In trophies great, from insects torn, she came; With stately step she trod the plain along, And threw her treasure 'midst the admiring throng. Forward with joy each curious mortal sprang, This caught a gaudy wing, and that a pointed fang. Before the giddy throng, which now advanced, With mincing step gay Affectation danced, Then sudden stopp'd, and staring on the crowd, She frown'd, then smiled, and giggled out aloud. The numerous throng attending round the fair, Mimic'd her gestures, and assumed her air. A crowd of mortals here, with wondering eyes, All pale and trembling gazed upon the skies; Where on blue plains opposing hosts engage, While shouts are heard and all the battle's rage. Amidst the throng stood cold and heartless Fear, The fall of nations whispering in each ear. Here pallid spectres gleam'd, and there were seen The fairy train in gambols on the green. Through miry ways the rustic journeys round, Nor dares presuming tread the hallow'd ground; Dire ills await the wretch, so fable sings, Or pinch'd all o'er, or pierced with thousand stings. The structure entering, as around I threw My wondering eyes, gay forms arose to view. False Pleasure here the borrow'd form of Joy Assumed, and roll'd around her sparkling eye. But who, allured by her enchanting song, From virtue shrinks, and mingles with her throng, Soon sees her beauties fade, and to his eyes Deformity and sad disease arise. In a dark corner hell-born Jealousy, A wan and haggard sprite, I did espy; Watchful she roll'd her ghastly eyes around, And cautious trod, to catch the whispering sound. Her heart for ever deathless vultures tear, And by her side stalk anguish and despair. Curst is the wretch with her dire rage possess'd, When fancied ills destroy his wonted rest. Pale Avarice was seen with looks of care, And clasp'd her bags with never ceasing fear. Close following her, a wretched spectre came, With tatter'd garments, Poverty her name. In vain her search t' elude still Avarice strives, Amidst her store in endless want she lives. False Honor here I saw all gaily dress'd, Glass were her beads, and tinsel'd was her vest; Form'd in barbaric ages, rude her mien, And in her hand the sanguined sword was seen. Not stain'd like patriots in their country's cause, To save religion, or support the laws; In private strife the crimson torrents flow, Their country wounded by each fatal blow. With chequer'd hood Dissembling stood behind, And Falsehood, coining lies to cheat mankind; While with smooth art deceitful Flattery Address'd the ear of listening Vanity. The gloom was now disclosed where Spleen remain'd: A thousand various ills the goddess pain'd. As powerful Fancy works, here mortals are Transform'd to glass, or China's brittle ware; Oppress'd by Spleen, no longer joy they know, For ever tortured with imagined woe. As thus I onward moved with wandering pace, And view'd the varied wonders of the place; “Just heaven,” I cried, “Oh! give me to restrain Imagination with a steady rein! Though oft she leads through Pleasure's flowery ways, In Error's thorny path she sometimes strays. Let me my hours with solid judgment spend, Nor to Delusion's airy dreams attend; By Reason guided, we shall only know Those heavenly joys which Fancy can bestow! EPISTLE TO A FRIEND. FROM FORT HENRY. From where his lofty head Talheo rears, And o'er the wild in majesty appears, What shall I write that—wont disdain, Or worth, from thee one moment's space to gain? The muse,—in vain I court the lovely maid,— Views with contempt the rude unpolish'd shade; Nor only this, she flies fierce war's alarms, And seeks where peace invites with softer charms; Where the gay landscapes strike the traveller's eyes, And woods and lawns in beauteous order rise; Where the glad swain sings on the enamell'd green, And views, unawed by fears, the pleasing scene. Here no enchanting prospects yield delight, But darksome forests intercept the sight; Here fill'd with dread the trembling peasants go, And start with terror at each nodding bough, Nor as they trace the gloomy way along, Dare ask the influence of a cheering song. If in this wild a pleasing spot we meet, In happier times some humble swain's retreat; Where once with joy he saw the grateful soil Yield a luxuriant harvest to his toil, (Bless'd with content, enjoy'd his solitude, And knew his pleasures, though of manners rude;) The lonely prospect strikes a secret dread, While round the ravaged cot we silent tread, Whose owner fell beneath the savage hand, Or roves a captive on some hostile land, While the rich fields, with Ceres' blessings stored, Grieve for their slaughter'd or their absent lord. Yet would I now attempt some sprightly strain, And strive to wake your breast to mirth again, Yet would I call you from your Delia's urn, But Britain's genius bids her sons to mourn; She shows the fatal field, all drench'd in gore, And in sad accents cries, “My Howe's no more!” Then let again the briny torrents flow. Oh! teach your breast a nobler kind of woe! To mourn her faded beauties now forbear, And give the gallant chief a British tear. NATHANIEL EVANS. EPISTOLARY ODE TO A FRIEND. Like as Lybia's burning sand, Or the parch'd Arabian plain, Which gentle Eurus never fann'd, Would drink the unfathomable main— So is the wretch who endless craves, And restless pines in every state— O! place him with the worst of slaves, Whether in high or low estate; Heap him around with massy wealth, High-throne him on the seat of power; Each generous joy he'll use by stealth, While want shall prey on every hour; Let glittering pomp allure his soul, Or nobler fame his mind dilate; Through complicated plagues he'll roll, And dire vexations still create. The first-born mortal upon earth, When round him smiling nature play'd, With discontent was void of mirth, Though he o'er every creature sway'd. He who contented spends his days— Calm as the clear unruffled stream, His life in gentle current strays, Mild as the maiden's silver dream— Be he born to till the field, Or in war the sword to wield; If he o'er the midnight oil Wastes his life in learned toil, Studious to instruct mankind Where true happiness to find; Or if o'er the lawless main He roams in search of sordid gain; Or sorts with nobles in proud ease, Or humble swains in cottages; Be he with content but blest— He 's the happy man confest! Listen, dear Strephon, to my song— O herd not with ambitious slaves, Nor join thou with the vulgar throng— Their joys unstable as the waves. Strephon, thrice blest with fruitful plains, The lover of a sapient theme; Strephon, whose sweetly soothing strains Flow gently as thy native stream— O leave the ruthless scenes of war, Unfit art thou for rude alarms, Beside thy gentle Delaware, Come, Strephon, seek more pleasing charms. Here, while o'er the fertile valleys Thou shalt tuneful stray along, I will make repeated sallies, To catch the transport of thy song; Then mutual joy shall swell our soul, Attendant to bright wisdom's strain, While we shall quaff the friendly bowl, Far from the noisy and the vain. ODE ON THE PROSPECT OF PEACE. 1761. When elemental conflicts rage, And heaven is wrapp'd in tempests dire, When storms with storms dread combat wage, And thunders roll etherial fire;— Returning zephyr's odorous race, And radiant Sol's all-cheering face, The trembling mortals most desire. When Eurus, charged with livid clouds, Scours o'er old ocean's wild domain, And Boreas rends the vessel's shrouds, And o'er her swells the raging main; If lighter breezes should succeed, And Iris sweet, of varied hue, Lift o'er the main her beamy head, What raptures fill the marine crew! Thus, when Bellona (ruthless maid!) Her empire through the world has spread, And death his flag has proud display'd O'er legions that in battle bled;— If peace, bedeck'd with olive robe, (Resplendent nymph, sweet guest of heaven) Transfuse her balm around the globe, A theme of joy to man is given. Then wake, O muse! thy sweetest lays— Returning peace demands thy praise; And while the notes in varied cadence sound, Eye thou the Theban swan that soars o'er heav'nly ground. If thou from Albion's sea-girt shore, Advent'rous muse, wilt deign to rove, Inclined remotest realms to explore And soothe the savage soul to love; Hither wave thy wandering pinion, Here be fix'd thy last dominion. Warbling in 'Sylvania's grove, Bright-eyed Euphrosyne! attend. If genial peace can aught avail, With all thy graceful charms descend, And o'er the youthful lyre prevail. Bounteous peace with lavish hand, To every shore thy blessings strew, O veil the blood-polluted land, And all thy grateful joys renew. Thy blissful pregnant reign restore, And calm the breasts of angry kings; Thy horn of Amalthean store Ope, and expand thy golden wings; Till trade secure her treasure beams, And science reassumes her shades; Till shepherds quaff untainted streams, And hinds enjoy their native glades; Till the glad muses strike the lyre, And virtuous social deeds inspire; Till the loud drum no more shall bid to arms prepare, Nor brazen trumpets breathe the horrid din of war. Auspicious power, whose salutary ray Form'd this new world, and rear'd her infant fame, Extend anew thy mitigating sway, And quell the hero's battle-breathing flame. Ye fragrant myrtles, ope your peaceful bowers, And charm the warrior with your pleasing scenes, Shield him with woodbine's aromatic flowers, And for his sopha spread your velvet greens. For him the flute mellifluous shall blow In Lydian music, sounding soft and low, And blooming beauty, with attractive art, Shall sweetly melt the tumults of his heart; The nectar'd bowl, with rosy garlands twined, Shall waft his sorrows to the vagrant wind, While the victorious laurel of renown, In verdant wreaths his manly brows shall crown. Too long has war's terrific train, (The barbed spear and reeking blade) Made nations rue their chieftains slain, And sanguined every muse's shade. From distant Volga's rapid floods, To Canada's high towering woods, Has the deadly cannon bray'd. From whence the effulgent god of day Impearls Arabia's spicy fields, To where his setting lustres play— The world to British valor yields. How has bold Clive, with martial toil, O'er India borne his conquering lance, For Brunswick gain'd the distant soil, And dash'd th' aspiring hopes of France? Let Goree, rich with flaming ore, Heroic Keppel's acts proclaim, And Senegal's Eburnean shore Resound to future times his name. O'er red Germania's hostile waste, Britannia's chiefs have conquering shone. Brave Elliot's warlike fates have graced His monarch's high illustrious throne; And Granby's deeds the muses claim To swell the immortal trump of fame. But victory enough has waved her glittering wand, With British honors graced, o'er every prostrate land! Witness, ye plains bedew'd with gore, So late ambitious Gallia's boast, Where howling o'er the desert shore, Was seen the genius of the coast. Thus, leaning on her shatter'd spear, She wildly wail'd in deep despair, Her fallen towers and vanquish'd host— “As Niobe (when Juno's hate Pursued to death her tender care) I moan my offspring's hopeless fate, And vex with sighs the passing air. Not with less grief my bosom heaves, Than did the breast of Hector's sire, When slain were all his Dardan chiefs, And Ilium blazed with Grecian fire. For lo! where heap'd with slaughter'd Gauls, Is Louisbourg a ruin'd pile! Her bulwarks and stupendous walls Are whelm'd in dust and ashes vile. Imperial Lawrence heaves with woe, Of many a Gallic chief the grave, And as his purple billows flow To hoary Neptune's coral cave, Tells how my vaunting troops, o'erthrown, Britannia's matchless prowess own; Tells how Quebec, so late for martial might renown'd, Her rocky ramparts crush'd, lies smoking on the ground. “What force can Albion's warlike sons dismay, Dauntless who mingle in the embattled plain? What toils dishearten, or what dangers stay? Not rocks, nor deserts, nor the boisterous main! How torn my laurels, by her Wolfe's dread arm! O'er mountains huge, who chased my armed band, Roused the fierce savage with dire war's alarm, And hurl'd his thunder o'er my carnaged land! No more gay trophies shall emblaze my name, Nor Gallia's realms re-echo with my fame. Lost are those honors which my heroes gain'd, With blood my temples and my domes are stain'd; But men directed by a heavenly hand, 'Tis vain, 'tis mad, 'tis impious to withstand.”— She spoke, and mounting from a lofty height, Westward she wing'd her solitary flight. Thus has Britannia's glory beam'd, Where'er bright Phœbus, from his car, To earth his cheerful rays hath stream'd, Adown the crystal vault-of air. Enough o'er Britain's shining arms, Hath victory display'd her charms, Amid the horrid pomp of war— Descend then, Peace, angelic maid, And smooth Bellona's haggard brow; Haste to diffuse thy healing aid, Where'er implored by scenes of woe. Henceforth, whoe'er disturbs thy reign, Or stains the world with human gore, Be they from earth (a gloomy train!) Banish'd to hell's profoundest shore; Where vengeance, on Avernus' lake, Rages, with furious Até bound; And black rebellion's fetters shake, And discord's hideous murmurs sound; Where envy's noxious snakes entwine Her temples round, in gorgon mood, And bellowing faction rolls supine Along the flame-becurled flood!— Hence, then, to that accursed place, Disturbers of the human race! And with you bear ambition wild, and selfish pride, With persecution foul, and terror by her side. Thus driven from earth war's horrid train— O Peace, thou nymph divine, draw near! Here let the muses fix their reign, And crown with fame each rolling year. Source of joy and genuine pleasure, Queen of quiet, queen of leisure, Haste thy votaries to cheer! Cherish'd beneath thy hallow'd rule, Shall Pennsylvania's glory rise; Her sons, bred up in Virtue's school, Shall lift her honors to the skies— A state thrice blest with lenient sway, Where liberty exalts the mind; Where plenty basks the live long day, And pours her treasures unconfined. Hither, ye beauteous virgins tend, With Arts and Science by your side, Whose skill the untutor'd morals mend, And to fair honor mankind guide; And with you bring the graces three, To fill the soul with glory's blaze; Whose charms give charms to poesy, And consecrate the immortal lays— Such as, when mighty Pindar sung, Through the Alphean village rung; Or such as, Meles, by thy lucid fountains flow'd, When bold Mæonides with heavenly transports glow'd. To such, may Delaware, majestic flood, Lend, from his flowery banks, a ravish'd ear; Such note as may delight the wise and good, Or saints celestial may endure to hear! For if the muse can aught of time descry, Such notes shall sound thy crystal waves along, Thy cities fair with glorious Athens vie, Nor pure Ilissus boast a nobler song. On thy fair banks, a fane to Virtue's name Shall rise—and justice light her holy flame. All hail then, Peace! restore the golden days, And round the ball diffuse Britannia's praise; Stretch her wide empire to the world's last end, Till kings remotest to her sceptre bend! ODE TO MY INGENIOUS FRIEND, MR THOMAS GODFREY. While you, dear Tom, are forced to roam, In search of fortune, far from home, O'er bogs, e'er seas and mountains; I too, debarr'd the soft retreat Of shady groves, and murmur sweet Of silver prattling fountains, Must mingle with the bustling throng, And bear my load of cares along, Like any other sinner: For, where 's the ecstasy in this, To loiter in poetic bliss, And go without a dinner? Flaccus, we know, immortal bard! With mighty kings and statesmen fared, And lived in cheerful plenty: But now, in these degenerate days, The slight reward of empty praise, Scarce one receives in twenty. Well might the Roman swan, along The pleasing Tiber pour his song, When bless'd with ease and quiet; Oft did he grace Mæcenas' board, Who would for him throw by the lord, And in Falernian riot. But, dearest Tom! these days are past, And we are in a climate cast Where few the muse can relish; Where all the doctrine now that's told, Is that a shining heap of gold Alone can man embellish. Then since 't is thus, my honest friend, If you be wise, my strain attend, And counsel sage adhere to; With me, henceforward, join the crowd, And like the rest proclaim aloud, That money is all virtue! Then may we both, in time, retreat To some fair villa, sweetly neat, To entertain the muses; And then life's noise and trouble leave— Supremely blest, we'll never grieve At what the world refuses. HYMN TO MAY. Now had the beam of Titan gay Usher'd in the blissful May, Scattering from his pearly bed, Fresh dew on every mountain's head; Nature mild and debonair, To thee, fair maid, yields up her care. May, with gentle plastic hand, Clothes in flowery robe the land; O'er the vales the cowslips spreads, And eglantine beneath the shades; Violets blue befringe each fountain, Woodbines lace each steepy mountain; Hyacinths their sweets diffuse, And the rose its blush renews; With the rest of Flora's train, Decking lowly dale or plain. Through creation's range, sweet May! Nature's children own thy sway— Whether in the crystal flood, Amorous, sport the finny brood; Or the feather'd tribes declare, That they breathe thy genial air, While they warble in each grove Sweetest notes of artless love; Or their wound the beasts proclaim, Smitten with a fiercer flame; Or the passions higher rise, Sparing none beneath the skies, But swaying soft the human mind With feelings of ecstatic kind— Through wide creation's range, sweet May! All nature's children own thy sway. Oft will I, (e'er Phosphor's light Quits the glimmering skirts of night) Meet thee in the clover field, Where thy beauties thou shalt yield To my fancy, quick and warm, Listening to the dawn's alarm, Sounded loud by Chanticleer, In peals that sharply pierce the ear. And, as Sol his flaming car Urges up the vaulted air, Shunning quick the scorching ray, I will to some covert stray, Coolly bowers or latent dells, Where light-footed silence dwells, And whispers to my heaven-born dream, Fair Schuylkill, by thy winding stream! There I'll devote full many an hour, To the still-finger'd Morphean power, And entertain my thirsty soul With draughts from Fancy's fairy bowl; Or mount her orb of varied hue, And scenes of heaven and earth review. Nor in milder eve's decline, As the sun forgets to shine, And sloping down the ethereal plain, Plunges in the western main, Will I forbear due strain to pay To the song-inspiring May; But as Hesper 'gins to move Round the radiant court of Jove, (Leading through the azure sky All the starry progeny, Emitting prone their silver light, To re-illume the shades of night) Then, the dewy lawn along, I'll carol forth my grateful song, Viewing with transported eye The blazing orbs that roll on high, Beaming lustre, bright and clear, O'er the glowing hemisphere. Thus from the early blushing morn, Till the dappled eve's return, Will I, in free unlabor'd lay, Sweetly sing the charming May! VERSES FOR THE NEW YEAR, 1762. Still as emerges from the womb of time, Each circling year, you claim our humble rhyme; But where 's the muse, whose fiery numbers best Shall rouse heroic ardor in each breast? To wing the flight where conquest leads the way, Transcends our song, and mocks the feeble lay. Such themes sublime best suit a rapturous lyre, And bards transported with poetic fire— Yet when inspired with Britain's glorious fame, What bosom glows not with the hallow'd flame? When angry Gallia pour'd her hostile train, Intent on plunder, o'er th' Atlantic main; Strangers to arms, we knew no murderous art, Nor crimson falchion, nor the poisonous dart, From earliest youth, instructed to abhor The deadly engines of destructive war; The cannon's sound, as dire assail'd our ears, As Jove's red thunder, when he shakes the spheres. Yet to our aid when mighty Brunswick came, It kindled in each breast the martial flame; Undaunted as our warlike troops advance, To walls, inglorious, shrink the sons of France; Their cities storm'd, their chiefs in fetters bound, And their proud ramparts levell'd with the ground. O'er this new world, thus have Britannia's arms Restored lost peace, and exiled war's alarms; Again rich commerce crowns the merchant's toil, And smiling Ceres paints the pregnant soil. Thus the good shepherd, when he views from far The deadly wolves beset his fleecy care, Quick to their help his guardian crook he wields, And soon the prowling throng is scatter'd o'er the fields. Yet not to us is Britain's care confined, Her fame is wafted to remotest Ind; By justice call'd, her chiefs, with matchless swords, Have humbled mighty Asia's proudest lords; Far distant scenes her martial deeds of proclaim, And Pondicherry bows to Britain's name. See the sad chance of all destructive war— See Lally captived at the victor's car; Lally, whose soul the maddening furies claim, And cursed with longings for the voice of fame. So when a tyger, flush'd with reeking blood, Ramps o'er the plains, and tears the leafy wood, A lion spies him from his secret cave, Bursts from his stand, to seize the insulting slave; Then hunts him, generous, from the neighboring fields, And peace and safety to the forest yields. O'er Europe too, great George's arms prevail, And on its seas his fleets triumphant sail; Witness Belleisle, around whose wave-worn shore His navies ride, and his loud cannons roar. Oh! could we boast the seeds of epic song, Immortal Frederick should the verse prolong; The chief should shine, inclosed with fields of dead, And guardian angels hovering round his head. There, in dread chains the barbarous Russ should bow, And here, submissive, kneel the Hungarian foe; There should be seen to bend, the sons of Gaul, Here lesser troops, his enemies, should fall. Thus firm a rock, begirt with raging waves, Stands the fierce charge, though all the tempest raves; Now round his summit dash the broken tides, And vainly beat his adamantine sides! But these we leave to deck the historic page, And wake the wonder of a future age. Now let our muse the Paphian trumpet blow, Beauty 's the theme, and melting strains shall flow. See Neptune, mounting with his nereid train, To smooth the surface of the azure main; As conscious of his charge, he joys to please The beauteous Charlotte, mistress of the seas! The jovial sailors ply their shining oars, And now they reach fair Albion's white-cliff shores; With warbling flutes, and hautboy's pleasing sound, They spread sweet music's silver notes around. On Cydnus' stream, so once array'd was seen Fair Cleopatra, Egypt's beauteous queen. But here we fix, rejoiced to see you bless'd, And Britain's glory in each clime confess'd! ELEGY TO THE MEMORY OF MR THOMAS GODFREY. O death! thou victor of the human frame! The soul's poor fabric trembles at thy name! How long shall man be urged to dread thy sway, For those whom thou untimely tak'st away? Life's blooming spring just opens to our eyes, And strikes the senses with a sweet surprise, When thy fierce arm uplifts the fatal blow That hurls us breathless to the earth below. Sudden, as darts the lightning through the sky, Around the globe thy various weapons fly. Here war's red engines heap the field with slain, And pallid sickness there extends thy reign; Here the soft virgin weeps her lover dead, There maiden beauty sinks the graceful head; Here infants grieve their parents are no more, There reverend sires their children's deaths deplore; Here the sad friend—O! save the sacred name, Yields half his soul to thy relentless claim; O pardon, pardon the descending tear! Friendship commands, and not the muses, here. O say, thou much loved, dear departed shade, To what celestial region hast thou stray'd? Where is that vein of thought, that noble fire, Which fed thy soul, and bade the world admire? That manly strife with fortune to be just, That love of praise? an honorable thirst! The soul, alas! has fled to endless day, And left its house a mouldering mass of clay. There, where no fears invade, nor ills molest, Thy soul shall dwell immortal with the blest; In that bright realm, where dearest friends no more Shall from each other's throbbing breasts be tore, Where all those glorious spirits sit enshrined, The just, the good, the virtuous of mankind. There shall fair angels in a radiant ring, And the great Son of heaven's eternal King, Proclaim thee welcome to the blissful skies, And wipe the tears for ever from thine eyes. How did we hope—alas! the hope how vain! To hear thy future more enripen'd strain; When fancy's fire with judgment had combined To guide each effort of the enraptured mind. Yet are those youthful glowing lays of thine The emanations of a soul divine; Who heard thee sing, but felt sweet music's dart In thrilling transports pierce his captive heart? Whether soft melting airs attuned thy song, Or pleased to pour the thundering verse along, Still nobly great, true offspring of the Nine, Alas! how blasted in thy glorious prime! So when first ope the eyelids of the morn, A radiant purple does the heavens adorn, Fresh smiling glory streaks the skies around, And gaily silvers each enamel'd mound, Till some black storm o'erclouds the ether fair, And all its beauties vanish into air. Stranger, whoe'er thou art, by fortune's hand Toss'd on the baleful Carolinian strand, Oh! if thou seest perchance the poet's grave, The sacred spot with tears of sorrow lave; Oh! shade it, shade it with ne'er fading bays. Hallow'd 's the place where gentle Godfrey lays. (So may no sudden dart from death's dread bow, Far from the friends thou lov'st, e'er lay thee low,) There may the weeping morn its tribute bring, And angels shield it with their golden wing, Till the last trump shall burst the womb of night, And the purged atoms to their soul unite! JOHN OSBORN. A WHALING SONG. When spring returns with western gales, And gentle breezes sweep The ruffling seas, we spread our sails To plough the wat'ry deep. For killing northern whales prepared, Our nimble boats on board, With craft and rum (our chief regard) And good provisions stored, Cape Cod, our dearest, native land, We leave astern, and lose Its sinking cliffs and lessening sands, While Zephyr gently blows. Bold, hardy men, with blooming age, Our sandy shores produce; With monstrous fish they dare engage, And dangerous callings choose. Now towards the early dawning east We speed our course away, With eager minds, and joyful hearts, To meet the rising day. Then as we turn our wondering eyes, We view one constant show; Above, around, the circling skies, The rolling seas below. When eastward, clear of Newfoundland, We stem the frozen pole. We see the icy islands stand, The northern billows roll. As to the north we make our way, Surprising scenes we find; We lengthen out the tedious day, And leave the night behind. Now see the northern regions, where Eternal winter reigns; One day and night fills up the year, And endless cold maintains. We view the monsters of the deep, Great whales in numerous swarms; And creatures there, that play and leap, Of strange, unusual forms. When in our station we are placed, And whales around us play, We launch our boats into the main, And swiftly chase our prey. In haste we ply our nimble oars, For an assault design'd; The sea beneath us foams and roars, And leaves a wake behind. A mighty whale we rush upon, And in our irons throw: She sinks her monstrous body down Among the waves belows. And when she rises out again, We soon renew the fight; Thrust our sharp lances in amain, And all her rage excite. Enraged, she makes a mighty bound; Thick foams the whiten'd sea; The waves in circles rise around, And widening roll away. She thrashes with her tail around, And blows her redd'ning breath; She breaks the air, a deaf'ning sound, While ocean groans beneath. From numerous wounds, with crimson flood She stains the frothy seas, And gasps, and blows her latest blood, While quivering life decays. With joyful hearts we see her die, And on the surface lay; While all with eager haste apply, To save our deathful prey. ELEGIAC EPISTLE, ADDRESSED TO ONE OF HIS SISTERS ON THE DEATH OF ANOTHER. Dear sister, see the smiling spring In all its beauties here; The groves a thousand pleasures bring, A thousand grateful scenes appear. With tender leaves the trees are crown'd, And scatter'd blossoms all around, Of various dyes Salute your eyes, And cover o'er the speckled ground. Now thickets shade the glassy fountains; Trees overhang the purling streams; Whisp'ring breezes brush the mountains, Grots are fill'd with balmy steams. But, sister, all the sweets that grace The spring and blooming nature's face; The chirping birds, Nor lowing herds; The woody hills, Nor murm'ring rills; The sylvan shades, Nor flowery meads, To me their former joys dispense, Though all their pleasures court my sense. But melancholy damps my mind, I lonely walk the field, With inward sorrow fill'd, And sigh to every breathing wind. I mourn our tender sister's death, In various plaintive sounds; While hills above, and vales beneath, The faltering notes rebound. Perhaps when in the pains of death, She gasp'd her latest breath, You saw our pensive friends around, With tears bedew the ground. Our loving father stand, And press her trembling hand, And gently cry, “My child, adieu! We all must follow you.” Some tender friend did then perhaps arise, And close her dying eyes: Her stiffen'd body, cold and pale, Was then convey'd within the gloomy vale Of death's unhallow'd shade. Weak mortals, Oh! how hard our fate; How sure our death,—how short our date, How quickly sets our day! We all are doom'd to lay our heads Beneath the earth in mournful shades, To hungry worms a prey. But, loving sister, let's prepare With virtue's steady feet, That we may boldly meet The rider of the pale horse void of fear. But why should you and I for ever mourn Our dear relation's death? She 's gone— We 've wept enough to prove Our grief and tender love. Let joy succeed, and smiles appear, And let us wipe off every tear. Not always the cold winter lasts, With snow and storms, and northern blasts. The raging seas with fury tost, Not always break and roar; Sometimes their native anger's lost. And smooth hush'd waves glide softly to the shore. MATHER BYLES. THE CONFLAGRATION. In some calm midnight, when no whispering breeze Waves the tall woods, or curls the undimpled seas, Lull'd on their oozy beds, the rivers seem Softly to murmur in a pleasing dream; The shaded fields confess a still repose, And on each hand the dewy mountains drowse: Meantime the moon, fair empress of the night! In solemn silence sheds her silver light, While twinkling stars their glimmering beauties shew, And wink perpetual o'er the heavenly blue; Sleep, nodding, consecrates the deep serene, And spreads her brooding wings o'er all the dusky scene; Through the fine ether moves no single breath; But all is hushed as in the arms of death. At once, great God! thy dire command is given, That the last tempest shake the frame of heaven. Straight thickening clouds in gloomy volumes rise, Gather on heaps, and blacken in the skies; Sublime through heaven redoubling thunders roll; And gleaming lightnings flash from pole to pole. Old ocean with presaging horror roars, And rousing earthquakes rumble round the shores; Ten thousand terrors o'er the globe are hurl'd, And general dread alarms a guilty world. But Oh! what glory breaks the scattering glooms? Lo! down the opening skies, he comes! he comes! The Judge descending flames along the air; And shouting myriads pour around his car: Each ravish'd seraph labors in his praise, And saints, alternate, catch the immortal lays: Here in melodious strains blest voices sing, Here warbling tubes, and here the vocal string, Here from sweet trumpets silver accents rise, And the shrill clangor echoes round the skies. And now, O earth! thy final doom attend, In awful silence meet thy fiery end. Lo! rising radiant from his burning throne, The Godhead, thundering, calls the ruins on. “Curst earth! polluted with the prophets' blood, Thou, the vile murderer of the Son of God, Full ripe for vengeance, vengeance be thy due, Perish in flames, refine, and rise anew!” Thus as he speaks, all nature owns the God, Quiver the plains, the lofty mountains nod. The hollow winding caverns echo round, And earth, and sea, and air, and heaven resound. Now rattling on, tremendous thunder rolls, And loudly crashing, shakes the distant poles; O'er the thick clouds amazing lightnings glare, Flames flash at flames, and vibrate through the air Roaring volcanoes murmur for their prey, And from their mouth curls the black smoke away; Deep groans the earth, at its approaching doom, While in slow pomp the mighty burnings come. As when dark clouds rise slowly from the main, Then, in swift sluices, deluge all the plain, Descending headlong down the mountain's sides, A thousand torrents roll their foamy tides, The rushing rivers rapid roar around, And all the shores return the dashing sound: Thus awful, slow, the fiery deluge lowers, Thus rushes down, and thus resounding roars. But O! what sounds are able to convey The wild confusions of the dreadful day! Eternal mountains totter on their base, And strong convulsions work the valley's face; Fierce hurricanes on sounding pinions soar, Rush o'er the land, on the toss'd billows roar, And dreadful in resistless eddies driven, Shake all the crystal battlements of heaven. See the wild winds, big blustering in the air, Drive through the forests, down the mountains tear, Sweep o'er the valleys in their rapid course, And nature bends beneath the impetuous force. Storms rush at storms, at tempests tempests roar, Dash waves on waves, and thunder to the shore. Columns of smoke on heavy wings ascend, And dancing sparkles fly before the wind. Devouring flames, wide-waving, roar aloud, And melted mountains flow a fiery flood: Then, all at once, immense the fires arise, A bright destruction wraps the crackling skies; While all the elements to melt conspire, And the world blazes in the final fire. Yet shall ye, flames, the wasting globe refine, And bid the skies with purer splendor shine, The earth, which the prolific fires consume, To beauty burns, and withers into bloom; Improving in the fertile flame it lies, Fades into form, and into vigor dies: Fresh-dawning glories blush amidst the blaze, And nature all renews her flowery face. With endless charms the everlasting year Rolls round the seasons in a full career; Spring, ever-blooming, bids the fields rejoice, And warbling birds try their melodious voice; Where'er she treads, lilies unbidden blow, Quick tulips rise, and sudden roses glow: Her pencil paints a thousand beauteous scenes, Where blossoms bud amid immortal greens; Each stream, in mazes, murmurs as it flows, And floating forests gently bend their boughs. Thou, autumn, too, sitt'st in the fragrant shade, While the ripe fruits blush all around thy head: And lavish nature, with luxuriant hands, All the soft months, in gay confusion blends. The holy nation here transported roves Beneath the spreading honors of the groves, And pleased, attend, descending down the hills, The murmuring music of the running rills. Anthems divine by every harp are played, And the soft music warbles through the shade. Hither, my lyre, thy soft assistance bring, And let sweet accents leap from string to string: Join the bright chorus of the future skies, While all around loud Hallelujah's rise, And to the tuneful lays the echoing vault replies. This blessed hope, my ravish'd mind inspires, And through my bosom flash the sacred fires: No more my heart its growing joy contains, But driving transports rush along my veins; I feel a paradise within my breast, And seem already of a heaven possess'd. THE GOD OF TEMPEST AND EARTHQUAKE. Thy dreadful power, Almighty God, Thy works to speak conspire; This earth declares thy fame abroad, With water, air, and fire. At thy command, in glaring streaks, The ruddy lightning flies, Loud thunder the creation shakes, And rapid tempests rise. Now gathering glooms obscure the day, And shed a solemn night; And now the heavenly engines play, And shoot devouring light. The attending sea thy will performs, Waves tumble to the shore, And toss, and foam amidst the storms, And dash, and rage, and roar. The earth, and all her trembling hills, Thy marching footsteps own; A shuddering fear her entrails fills, Her hideous caverns groan. My God! when terrors thickest throng, Through all the mighty space, And rattling thunders roar along, And bloody lightnings blaze: When wild confusion wrecks the air, And tempests rend the skies, Whilst blended ruin, clouds and fire In harsh disorder rise: Amid the hurricane I'll stand And strike a tuneful song; My harp all trembling in my hand, And all inspired my tongue. I'll shout aloud, “Ye thunders! roll, And shake the sullen sky; Your sounding voice from pole to pole In angry murmurs try. “Thou sun! retire, refuse thy light, And let thy beams decay; Ye lightnings, flash along the night, And dart a dreadful day. “Let the earth totter on her base, Clouds heaven's wide arch deform; Blow, all ye winds, from every place, And breathe the final storm. “O Jesus, haste the glorious day, When thou shalt come in flame, And burn the earth, and waste the sea, And break all nature's frame. “Come quickly, blessed hope, appear, Bid thy swift chariot fly: Let angels warn thy coming near, And snatch me to the sky. “Around thy wheels, in the glad throng, I'd bear a joyful part; All Hallelujah on my tongue, All rapture in my heart.” ELEGY, ADDRESSED TO GOVERNOR BELCHER ON THE DEATH OF HIS LADY. Belcher, once more permit the muse you loved, By honor, and by sacred friendship moved, Waked by your woe, her numbers to prolong, And pay her tribute in a funeral song. From you, great heaven with undisputed voice, Has snatch'd the partner of your youthful joys. Her beauties, ere slow hectic fires consumed, Her eyes shone cheerful, and her roses bloom'd: Long lingering sickness broke the lovely form, Shock after shock, and storm succeeding storm, Till death, relentless, seized the wasting clay, Stopp'd the faint voice, and catch'd the soul away. No more in converse sprightly she appears, With nice decorum, and obliging airs: Ye poor, no more expecting round her stand, Where soft compassion stretch'd her bounteous hand Her house, her happy skill no more shall boast; “Be all things plentiful, but nothing lost.” Cold to the tomb, see the pale corpse convey'd, Wrapt up in silence, and the dismal shade. Ah! what avail the sable velvet spread, And golden ornaments amidst the dead? No beam smiles there, no eye can there discern The vulgar coffin from the marble urn: The costly honors, preaching, seem to say, “Magnificence must mingle with the clay.” Learn here, ye fair, the frailty of your face, Ravish'd by death, or nature's slow decays: Ye great, must so resign your transient power, Heroes of dust, and monarchs of an hour! So must each pleasing air, each gentle fire, And all that's soft, and all that's sweet expire. But you, O Belcher, mourn the absent fair, Feel the keen pang, and drop the tender tear: The God approves that nature do her part, A panting bosom, and a bleeding heart. Ye baser arts of flattery, away! The virtuous muse shall moralize her lay. To you, O favorite man, the power supreme, Gives wealth, and titles, and extent of fame; Joys from beneath, and blessings from above; Thy monarch's plaudit; and thy people's love: The same high power, unbounded, and alone, Resumes his gifts, and puts your mourning on. His edict issues, and his vassal, death, Requires your consort's,—or your flying breath. Still be your glory at his feet to bend, Kiss thou the Son, and own his sovereign hand; For his high honors all thy powers exert, The gifts of nature, and the charms of art; So, over death, the conquest shall be given, Your name shall live on earth, your soul in heaven. Meantime my name to thine allied shall stand, Still our warm friendship, mutual flames extend; The muse shall so survive from age to age, And Belcher's name protect his Byles's page. HYMN WRITTEN DURING A VOYAGE. Great God thy works our wonder raise; To thee our swelling notes belong; While skies and winds, and rocks and seas, Around shall echo to our song. Thy power produced this mighty frame, Aloud to thee the tempests roar, Or softer breezes tune thy name Gently along the shelly shore. Round thee the scaly nation roves, Thy opening hands their joys bestow, Through all the blushing coral groves, These silent gay retreats below. See the broad sun forsake the skies, Glow on the waves and downward glide, Anon heaven opens all its eyes, And star-beams tremble o'er the tide. Each various scene, or day or night, Lord! points to thee our nourish'd soul; Thy glories fix our whole delight; So the touch'd needle courts the pole. JOSEPH GREEN. [Lines on Byle's Voyage] In David's Psalms an oversight Byles found one morning at his tea, Alas! that he should never write A proper psalm to sing at sea. Thus ruminating on his seat, Ambitious thoughts at length prevail'd. The bard determined to complete The part wherein the prophet fail'd. He sat awhile and stroked his muse, Byles's favorite cat, so named by his friends. Then taking up his tuneful pen, Wrote a few stanzas for the use Of his seafaring brethren. The task perform'd, the bard content, Well chosen was each flowing word; On a short voyage himself he went, To hear it read and sung on board. Most serious Christians do aver, (Their credit sure we may rely on,) In former times that after prayer, They used to sing a song of Zion. Our modern parson having pray'd, Unless loud fame our faith beguiles, Sat down, took out his book and said, “Let 's sing a psalm of Mather Byles.” At first, when he began to read, Their heads the assembly downward hung. But he with boldness did proceed, And thus he read, and thus they sung. THE PSALM. With vast amazement we survey The wonders of the deep, Where mackerel swim, and porpoise play, And crabs and lobsters creep. Fish of all kinds inhabit here, And throng the dark abode. Here haddock, hake, and flounders are, And eels, and perch, and cod, From raging winds and tempests free, So smoothly as we pass, The shining surface seems to be A piece of Bristol glass. But when the winds and tempests rise, And foaming billows swell, The vessel mounts above the skies, And lower sinks than hell. Our heads the tottering motion feel, And quickly we become Giddy as new-dropp'd calves, and reel Like Indians drunk with rum. What praises then are due that we Thus far have safely got, Amarescoggin tribe to see, And tribe of Penobscot. A MOURNFUL LAMENTATION FOR THE DEATH OF MR OLD TENOR. A New England currency. A doleful tale prepare to hear, As ever yet was told: The like, perhaps, ne'er reach'd the ear Of either young or old. 'T is of the sad and woeful death Of one of mighty fame, Who lately hath resign'd his breath; Old Tenor was his name. In vain ten thousands intercede, To keep him from the grave; In vain, his many good works plead; Alas! they cannot save. The powers decree, and die he must, It is the common lot, But his good deeds, when he's in dust, Shall never be forgot. He made our wives and daughters fine, And pleased everybody: He gave the rich their costly wine, The poor their flip and toddy. The laborer he set to work; In ease maintain'd the great: He found us mutton, beef, and pork, And everything we eat. To fruitful fields, by swift degrees, He turn'd our desert land: Where once nought stood but rocks and trees, Now spacious cities stand. He built us houses, strong and high, Of wood, and brick, and stone; The furniture he did supply; But now, alas! he 's gone. The merchants too, those topping folks, To him owe all their riches; Their ruffles, lace, and scarlet cloaks, And eke their velvet breeches. He launch'd their ships into the main, To visit distant shores; And brought them back, full fraught with gain, Which much increased their stores. Led on by him our soldiers bold, Against the foe advance; And took, in spite of wet and cold, Strong Cape Breton from France. Who from that fort the French did drive, Shall he so soon be slain? While they, alas! remain alive, Who gave it back again. From house to house, and place to place, In paper doublet clad, He pass'd, and where he show'd his face, He made the heart full glad. But cruel death, that spareth none, Hath robbed us of him too; Who through the land so long hath gone, No longer now must go. In senate he, like Cæsar, fell, Pierced through with many a wound, He sunk, ah, doleful tale to tell! The members sitting round: And ever since that fatal day, Oh! had it never been, Closely confined at home he lay, And scarce was ever seen, Until the last of March, when he Submitted unto fate; In anno regis twentythree, Ætatis fortyeight. For ever gloomy be that day, When he gave up the ghost; For by his death, oh! who can say, What hath New England lost? Then, good Old Tenor, fare thee well, Since thou art dead and gone; We mourn thy fate, e'en while we tell The good things thou hast done. Since the bright beams of yonder sun, Did on New England shine, In all the land, there ne'er was known A death so mourn'd as thine. Of every rank are many seen, Thy downfal to deplore; For 't is well known that thou hast been A friend to rich and poor. We'll o'er thee raise a silver tomb, Long may that tomb remain, To bless our eyes for years to come, But wishes, ah! are vain. And so God bless our noble state, And save us all from harm, And grant us food enough to eat, And clothes to keep us warm. Send us a lasting peace, and keep The times from growing worse; And let us all in safety sleep, With silver in our purse. [Law bears the name, but money has the power] Law bears the name, but money has the power. The cause is bad whene'er the client 's poor. Those strict-lived men, who seem above our world, Are oft too modest to resist our gold; So judgment like our other wares is sold. And the grave knight, that nods upon the laws, Waked by a fee, hems and approves the cause. Extempore on the fourth latin school being taken down to make room for enlarging the chapel church. A fig for your learning, I tell you the town, To make the church larger must pull the school down. “Unluckily spoken,” replied Master Birch, “Then learning, I fear, stops the growth of the church.” WILLIAM LIVINGSTON. PHILOSOPHIC SOLITUDE. Let ardent heroes seek renown in arms, Pant after fame, and rush to war's alarms; To shining palaces let fools resort, And dunces cringe to be esteem'd at court: Mine be the pleasure of a rural life, From noise remote, and ignorant of strife; Far from the painted belle, and white-gloved beau, The lawless masquerade, and midnight show, From ladies, lap-dogs, courtiers, garters, stars, Fops, fiddlers, tyrants, emperors, and czars. Full in the centre of some shady grove, By nature form'd for solitude and love; On banks array'd with ever blooming flowers, Near beauteous landscapes, or by roseate bowers; My neat, but simple mansion I would raise, Unlike the sumptuous domes of modern days; Devoid of pomp, with rural plainness form'd, With savage game, and glossy shells adorn'd. No costly furniture should grace my hall; But curling vines ascend against the wall, Whose pliant branches should luxuriant twine, While purple clusters swell'd with future wine: To slake my thirst a liquid lapse distil From craggy rocks, and spread a limpid rill. Along my mansion spiry firs should grow, And gloomy yews extend the shady row; The cedars flourish, and the poplars rise Sublimely tall, and shoot into the skies; Among the leaves refreshing zephyrs play, And crowding trees exclude the noon-tide ray; Whereon the birds their downy nests should form, Securely shelter'd from the battering storm; And to melodious notes their choir apply, Soon as Aurora blush'd along the sky; While all along the enchanting music rings, And every vocal grove responsive sings. Me to sequester'd scenes, ye muses, guide, Where nature wantons in her virgin pride; To mossy banks edged round with opening flowers, Elysian fields, and amaranthine bowers, T' ambrosial founts, and sleep-inspiring rills, To herbaged vales, gay lawns, and sunny hills. Welcome, ye shades! all hail, ye vernal blooms! Ye bowery thickets, and prophetic glooms! Ye forests, hail! ye solitary woods! Love-whispering groves, and silver-streaming floods! Ye meads, that aromatic sweets exhale! Ye birds, and all ye sylvan beauties, hail! Oh how I long with you to spend my days, Invoke the muse, and try the rural lays! No trumpets there with martial clangor sound, No prostrate heroes strew the crimson'd ground; No groves of lances glitter in the air, Nor thundering drums provoke the sanguine war: But white-robed peace, and universal love, Smile in the field, and brighten every grove. There all the beauties of the circling year, In native ornamental pride appear. Gay, rosy-bosom'd spring, and April showers Wake from the womb of earth the rising flowers: In deeper verdure summer clothes the plain, And autumn bends beneath the golden grain; The trees weep amber, and the whispering gales Breeze o'er the lawn, or murmur through the vales. The flowery tribes in gay confusion bloom, Profuse of sweets, and fragrant with perfume. On blossoms blossoms, fruits on fruits arise, And varied prospects glad the wand'ring eyes. In these fair seats I'd pass the joyous day, Where meadows flourish and where fields look gay; From bliss to bliss with endless pleasure rove, Seek crystal streams, or haunt the vernal grove, Woods, fountains, lakes, the fertile fields, or shades, Aerial mountains, or subjacent glades. When rising Phœbus ushers in the morn, And golden beams the impurpled skies adorn; Waked by the gentle murmur of the floods; Or the soft music of the waving woods, Rising from sleep with the melodious choir, To solemn sounds I'd tune the hallow'd lyre. Thy name, O God! should tremble on my tongue, Till every grove proved vocal to my song: (Delightful task! with dawning light to sing Triumphant hymns to heaven's eternal King.) Some courteous angel should my breast inspire, Attune my lips, and guide the warbled wire, While sportive echoes catch the sacred sound, Swell every note, and bear the music round; While mazy streams meandering to the main, Hang in suspense to hear the heavenly strain, And hush'd to silence all the feather'd throng, Attentive listen to the tuneful song. Father of Light! exhaustless source of good! Supreme, eternal, self-existent God! Before the beamy sun dispensed a ray, Flamed in the azure vault, and gave the day; Before the glimmering moon with borrow'd light Shone queen amid the silver host of night, High in the heavens, thou reign'dst superior Lord, By suppliant angels worshipp'd and adored. With the celestial choir then let me join In cheerful praises to the power divine. To sing thy praise, do thou, O God! inspire A mortal breast with more than mortal fire. In dreadful majesty thou sitt'st enthroned, With light encircled, and with glory crown'd: Through all infinitude extends thy reign, For thee, nor heaven, nor heaven of heavens contain; But though thy throne is fix'd above the sky Thy omnipresence fills immensity. Saints robed in white, to thee their anthems bring, And radiant martyrs hallelujahs sing: Heaven's universal host their voices raise In one eternal chorus to thy praise; And round thy awful throne with one accord Sing, holy, holy, holy is the Lord. At thy creative voice, from ancient night Sprang smiling beauty, and yon worlds of light: Thou spak'st—the planetary chorus rolled, And all the expanse was starr'd with beamy gold; “Let there be light,” said God,—light instant shone, And from the orient burst the golden sun; Heaven's gazing hierarchies with glad surprise Saw the first morn invest the recent skies, And straight the exulting troops thy throne surround With thousand thousand harps of heavenly sound; Thrones, powers, dominions, (ever-shining trains!) Shouted thy praises in triumphant strains: “Great are thy works,” they sing, and all around “Great are thy works,” the echoing heavens resound. The effulgent sun, insufferably bright, Is but a beam of thy o'erflowing light; The tempest is thy breath: the thunder hurl'd, Tremendous roars thy vengeance o'er the world; Thou bow'st the heavens; the smoking mountains nod, Rocks fall to dust, and nature owns her God; Pale tyrants shrink, the atheist stands aghast, And impious kings in horror breathe their last. To this great God, alternately I 'd pay The evening anthem, and the morning lay. For sovereign gold I never would repine, Nor wish the glittering dust of monarchs mine. What though high columns heave into the skies, Gay ceilings shine, and vaulted arches rise, Though fretted gold and sculptured roof adorn, The rubbies redden, and the jaspers burn! Or what, alas! avails the gay attire To wretched man, who breathes but to expire! Oft on the vilest riches are bestow'd, To show their meanness in the sight of God. High from a dunghill, see a Dives rise, And Titan-like insult the avenging skies: The crowd in adulation calls him lord, By thousands courted, flatter'd, and adored: In riot plunged, and drunk with earthly joys, No higher thought his grovelling soul employs; The poor he scourges with an iron rod, And from his bosom banishes his God. But oft in height of wealth and beauty's bloom, Deluded man is fated to the tomb! For, lo, he sickens, swift his color flies, And rising mists obscure his swimming eyes: Around his bed his weeping friends bemoan, Extort the unwilling tear, and wish him gone; His sorrowing heir augments the tender shower, Deplores his death—yet hails the dying hour. Ah, bitter comfort! sad relief to die! Though sunk in down, beneath a canopy! His eyes no more shall see the cheerful light, Weigh'd down by death in everlasting night: And now the great, the rich, the proud, the gay, Lies breathless, cold—unanimated clay! He that just now was flatter'd by the crowd With high applause, and acclamation loud; That steel'd his bosom to the orphan's cries, And drew down torrents from the widow's eyes; Whom, like a God, the rabble did adore— Regard him now—and lo! he is no more. My eyes no dazzling vestments should behold, With gems instarr'd, and stiff with woven gold; But the tall ram his downy fleece afford, To clothe in modest garb his frugal lord. Thus the great father of mankind was dress'd, When shaggy hides composed his flowing vest; Doom'd to the cumbrous load for his offence, When clothes supplied the want of innocence; But now his sons (forgetful whence they came,) Glitter in gems, and glory in their shame. Oft would I wander through the dewy field, Where clustering roses balmy fragrance yield; Or in lone grots for contemplation made, Converse with angels, and the mighty dead: For all around unnumber'd spirits fly, Waft on the breeze, or walk the liquid sky, Inspire the poet with repeated dreams, Who gives his hallow'd muse to sacred themes, Protect the just, serene their gloomy hours, Becalm their slumbers, and refresh their powers. Methinks I see the immortal beings fly, And swiftly shoot athwart the streaming sky: Hark! a melodious voice I seem to hear, And heavenly sounds invade my listening ear. “Be not afraid of us, innoxious band, Thy cell surrounding by divine command; Erewhile like thee we led our lives below, (Sad lives of pain, of misery, and woe!) Long by affliction's boisterous tempests tost, We reach'd at length the ever-blissful coast: Now in the embowering groves and lawns above, We taste the raptures of immortal love, Attune the golden harp in roseate bowers, Or bind our temples with unfading flowers. Oft on kind errands bent, we cut the air To guard the righteous, heaven's peculiar care! Avert impending harms, their minds compose, Inspire gay dreams, and prompt their soft repose. When from thy tongue divine hosannas roll, And sacred raptures swell thy rising soul, To heaven we bear thy prayers like rich perfumes, Where, by the throne, the golden censer fumes. And when with age thy head is silver'd o'er, And cold in death, thy bosom beats no more, Thy soul exulting shall desert its clay, And mount triumphant to eternal day.” BENJAMIN CHURCH. THE TIMES. Pollio, be kind! nor chide an early crime, Spawn of chagrin, and labor'd waste of time; This heart misguides me with a bent so strong, It mocks restraint, and boldly errs in song: Thus crimes indulged, such vigorous growth obtain, Your friendly caution frowns rebuke in vain. 'T is not great Churchill's ghost that claims your ear For even ghosts of wit are strangers here; The patriot-soul to other climes removed, Well-pleased enjoys that liberty he loved; No pang resents for W? to exile driven, Exults that worth and Pratt are dear to heaven: Young sure it is not, from whose honey'd lays Streams a rank surfeit of redundant praise; For guilt like his what genius shall atone? Curse the foul verse that daubs a Stuart's throne. Cursed lack of genius, or thou soon should'st know, This humble cot conceals a tyrant's foe; By nature artless, unimproved by pains, No favor courts me, and no fear restrains, Wild as the soil, and as the heavens severe, All rudely rough, and wretchedly sincere; Whose frowning stars have thrown me God knows where, A wild exotic neighbor to the bear; One glebe supports us, brethren cubs we run, Shoot into form, as fostered by the sun; No tutoring hand the tender sapling train'd Through walks of science, nor his growth sustain'd; Such fruit he yields, luxuriant wildings bear, Coarse as the earth, and unconfined as air: No muse I court, an alien to the Nine, Thou chaste instructress, Nature! thou art mine; Come, blessed parent, mistress, muse, and guide, With thee permit me wander, side by side; Smit with thy charms, my earliest joy I trace, Fondly enamor'd of thy angel face; Succeeding labors smother not the flame, Still, still the dear attachment lives the same. No idle task the earliest muse began, But mark'd the morals, e'er she praised the man; To struggling worth supplied no feeble aid, And wove the honest wreath for virtue's head, Uncourtly grave, or through the lessen'd page Shed wisdom's lore, and humanized the age; Pour'd wholesome treasures from her magic tongue, Instructed, ruled, corrected, blest, by song: How changed! how lost! in these degenerate days, She stuns me with the clamor of her praise: Is there a villain eminent in state, Without one gleam of merit?—she'll create; Is there a scoundrel, has that scoundrel gold? There the full tide of panegyric 's roll'd; From venal quills shall stream the sugar'd shower, And bronze the wretched lordling—if in power: Stamp me that blockhead, which (kind heaven be blest!) My Maker form'd my temper to detest, If sacred numbers I again desert, The native bias of an honest heart, Basely to truckle to a wretch in rule, Or spread a feast for gods, to cram a fool. Not for a monarch would I forge a lie, To nestle in the sunshine of his eye. The paths of error if in youth I trod, Dress'd a gay idol in the garb of God, The pageant shrinks, I weep my folly past, Heaven frown me dead, but there I've sinn'd my last. George, scarce one lustrum numbers out its days, Since every tongue was busy in thy praise; (O make it nameless in the tale of time, Nor consecrate to ages such a crime; We loved him, love him still, by heavens do more, But make us British subjects, we'll adore.) Successful war has added wide domain, And crowded oceans scarce his fleets sustain. United Gaul and Spain his easy prey, And but compact to give their realms away; Where'er he bids, consenting Britons fly, For George they conquer, or for George they die; Bless the glad hour, the glorious strife approve, That sounds his glory, and proclaims their love; Ah, sad reverse! with doubling sighs I speak, A flood of sorrow coursing down my cheek, The salient heart for George forgets to bound, Dark disaffection sheds her gloom around; Fair liberty, our soul's most darling prize, A bleeding victim flits before our eyes: Was it for this our great forefathers rode O'er a vast ocean to this bleak abode! When liberty was into contest brought, And loss of life was but a second thought; By pious violence rejected thence, To try the utmost stretch of providence; The deep, unconscious of the furrowing keel, Essay'd the tempest to rebuke their zeal; The tawny natives and inclement sky Put on their terrors, and command to fly; They mock at danger; what can those appal? To whom fair liberty is all in all. See the new world their purchase, blest domain, Where lordly tyrants never forged the chain; The prize of valor, and the gift of prayer, Hear this and redden, each degenerate heir! Is it for you their honor to betray, And give the harvest of their blood away? Look back with reverence, awed to just esteem, Preserve the blessings handed down from them; If not, look forwards, look with deep despair, And dread the curses of your beggar'd heir: What bosom beats not, when such themes excite? Be men, be gods, be stubborn in the right. Where am I hurried? Pollio, I forbear, Again I'm calm, and claim thy sober ear; To independence bend the filial knee, And kiss her sister sage economy. Economy, you frown! “O hide our shame! 'T is vile profusion's ministerial name, To pinch the farmer groaning at the press, Commission leeches to adopt the peace; That peace obtain'd Scotch armies to augment, And sink the nation's credit two per cent; With barren Scottish bards the lists to load, Both place and pension partially bestowed; Nay more, the cave of famine to translate Within the purlieus of the royal gate; While brats from northern hills, full, battening lie, Their meagre southern masters pining by.” Peace, peace, my Pollio! sluice thy sorrows here; Thy country's ghost now points thee to its bier. Of foreign wrongs, and unfelt woes no more, While dogs cry havock on thy natal shore; Yon funeral torch that dimly gilds my cell, Comes fraught with mischiefs, terrible to tell; It dawns in sables—too officious ray! Yet, yet compassionately roll away; All, all is o'er, but anguish, slavery, fear, The chains already clanking in my ear; O death! though awful, but prevent this blow, No more thou 'rt censured for the human foe; O'er life's last ebbs, thy dregs of sorrow fling, Point all my pangs, and stab with every sting; I'll bless the alternative, if not a slave, And scorn the wretch who trembles at the grave. Art thou persuaded, for a moment cool, That nature made thee slave, and mark'd thee fool, That what we won by hardy war, was given, That non-resistance is secure of heaven; That persecution in our infant state, Was nursing kind compassion in the great; That emigration was not to secure Our liberties, but to enslave the more; That charters, privileges, patents, powers, Were ours till now, and now no longer ours; To claim exemption by the charter seal, Will rashly violate the common weal; Juries are nuisances, and traffic worse, And to be blind, sagacity of course; The stamp and land tax are as blessings meant, And opposition is our free consent; That where we are not, we most surely are, That wrong is right, black white, and foul is fair; That Mansfield 's honest, and that Pitt 's a knave, That Pratt 's a villain, and that Wilkes 's a slave; That godlike Temple is not greatly good, Nor Bute a rigid jacobite by blood; That sordid Grenville lately is become The patron of our liberties at home, (For whom, now hear me, gods! be hell inflamed, And murderers of their country doubly d?d) Now stretch thy pliant faith, adopt this creed, And be a J?r?d Ing?rs?l indeed; If thou art wretched, crawling in the dust, Condemn'd, despised, and herded with the just: Frown, honest Satire! menace what you will, Rogues rise luxuriant, and defeat you still; Fatigued with numbers, and oppress'd with gall, One general curse must overwhelm them all: But O ye vilest vile, detested few! Eager, intent, and potent to undo; Come out, ye parricides! here take your stand, Your solemn condemnation is at hand; Behold your crimes, and tremblingly await The grumbling thunder of your country's hate; Accursed as ye are! how durst ye bring An injured people to distrust their king? Accursed as ye are, how could ye dare, To lisp delusion in your monarch's ear? How do I laugh, when such vain coxcombs lower, Some grave pretence of dread, from lawless power; To hear a scribbling fry, beneath my hate, Adopt the fraud, and sanctify deceit; With mean importance, point regardless stings, To aid injustice, menace mighty things; Nay to such height of insolence they're flown, The knaves crave shelter underneath a throne; A throne all-gracious, such is George's praise, Nor shall oppression blast his sacred bays. Witness, ye fathers! whose protracted time, Fruitful of story, chronicles the clime; These howling deserts, hospitably tame, Erst snatch'd ye, martyrs, from the hungry flame; 'T was heaven's own cause, beneath whose sheltering power, Ye grew the wonder of the present hour; With anxious ear we 've drank your piteous tale, Where woes unnumber'd long and loud prevail; Here savage demons, sporting with your pains, There boding mischief in a Stuart reigns; Mark the glad era, when prevailing foes, The state's fell harpies, doubling woes on woes, Had wing'd destruction—vengeance slept no more, But flung the tyrant from the British shore: Learn hence, ye minions! reverence to the law, Salvation died not with the great Nassau. And shall such sons, from such distinguished sires, Nurtured to hardships, heirs of all their sires, Shall they, O pang of heart! thus tamely bear, Who stalk erect, and toss their heads in air? Let beasts of burthen meanly woo the chain, We talk of masters with a proud disdain. “Prythee forbear, rash youth! conceal thy fears, A modest silence best becomes thy years; Submit, be prudent—in some future hour, You'll feel the iron-gripe of ruthless power:” Truce, spawn of phlegm! thy frozen heart conceal, Benumb'd, unerring, and unapt to feel; No deed of glory can that soul entice, Involved in adamantine walls of ice; Within that bosom is a nook so warm, That vice or virtue kindles to a storm? Could nature ever lure thee into sin? Or bursts of passion thaw the frost within? Thou happy cynic! still thy senses lull, Profoundly cautious, and supinely dull; And should some hero start his rash career, Eccentric to thy lazy, drowsy sphere; Be wondrous wise, thy frigid temper bless, That never wrought thee to a bold excess: Call truth a libel, treason, honest zeal, So strange is virtue, and so few can feel; Call Churchill blockhead, Freedom, madness, rage, Call injured Wilkes a monster of the age; To make me blest, unite this lay with those, And then, then kindly rate yourselves my foes. Fop, witling, favorite, stampman, tyrant, tool, Or all those mighty names in one, thou fool! Let mean ambition, sordid lust of pride, League thee, vile pander! to a tyrant's side. Sport with thy country's groans, and be the first To stab the bosom which a traitor nursed; Rifle the womb, and on those bowels prey, To plague mankind, that spawn'd thee into day; Be eminent, thy little soul exert, And call forth all the rancor of thy heart: But should the eye of merit on thee lower, (Though lowly crush'd beneath the wheel of power,) Thou art my pity, monster! I forgive, And beg one only curse, that thou mayst live. Where lies our remedy, in humble prayer? Our lordly butchers have forgot to hear; 'T is rank rebellion, rashness to complain, And all submission tighter tugs the chain: Go ask your heart, your honest heart regard, And manumission is your sure reward; Would'st thou be blest, thy sovereign pride lay by, To tyrant custom give the hardy lie; Yon shag will warm thee, in thy country fleece Sleeps independence lined with balmy peace; Would'st thou be blest? be diligent! be wise! And make a chaste sufficiency suffice: Ye lovely fair! whom heaven's blest charms array, The proud Sultanas of some future day; Sweet as ye are, complete in every grace, That spreads angelic softness o'er the face; Go ply the loom—there lies the happy art, By new avenues to attack the heart; With labors of your own, but deck those charms, We'll rush with transport to your blissful arms. Amid this wreck—from all aspersions clear, Nay blush not, Peter, honest truths to hear; Base adulation never stain'd my lay, But modest merit must be brought to day; What though thy great desert mounts far above The mean expression of thy country's love; In praise like thine the rustic muse will soar, Then damn'd to endless silence sing no more. “With great contempt of power, alone to stand, Thy life, and spotless honors in thy hand; To wage unequal wars—and dare the worst, And if thy country perish, perish first; With pious vigilance the state to guard, And eminent in virtue, shun reward; No force of avarice warps thy steady heart, To meanness, falsehood, or dishonest art; A tyrant's mandate, thy supreme disdain, Our last, best bulwark in a Scottish reign.” These are the honors we to fame consign, Nay blush not, Peter—these are surely thine. To close—dread sovereign at whose sacred seat, Justice and mercy, spotless maidens meet; George! parent! king! our guardian, glory, pride, And thou, fair regent! blooming by his side! Thy offspring pleads a parent's fostering care, Reject not, frown not, but in mercy spare; Besprent with dust, the lowly suppliant lies, A helpless, guilty, injured sacrifice: If e'er our infant efforts could delight, Or growing worth found favor in thy sight, If warm affection due returns may plead, Or faith unshaken ever intercede; With modest boldness we thy smiles demand, Nor wish salvation from another hand; Depress'd, not helpless, while a Brunswick reigns, Whose righteous sceptre, no injustice stains. LINES ON THE ACCESSION OF GEORGE II. Where thick embowering shades, and clustering trees, Form soft recess, and shed poetic ease; Inarching boughs embrown the silent way, Fan breezy cool, and half exclude the day: A moss-clad rock here spread its bulky base, Where the lithe ivy winds its close embrace; Beneath its slope—grey parent of the wood, A mouldering oak, grotesque and naked, stood; From its chafed root, a gurgling rivulet strays, And through the forest worms its sparkling maze: Here his sluiced eyes, the pensive Pollio led, And lo his anguish utter'd, “George is dead.” The swift wing'd breeze, excursive, wafts the sound, The cloud-topp'd forest nodded to the ground; The bellying clouds, with sable skirts advance, And a dun horror shrouds the blue expanse; Slow swells the blast, the transient gusts arise, And grumbling thunders roll along the skies; The storm collects, in dusky clouds array'd, And brooding tempest frowns the deepest shade. Involved in glooms, reclined upon the oak, In faltering accents, Pollio sobb'd and spoke. “Lower on, ye sables, shed a tenfold gloom! George is deceased, and earth is but his tomb; The heavens were deaf, when Albion pour'd her cries Ah fruitless anguish! ah relentless skies! War on, ye elements, ye tempests sweep The heaving bosom of the hoary deep; Ye trembling forests hide your faded green, May darksome horrors wrap the saddening scene; Ye verdant walks a sicklier face shall wear, No flowers, to breathe soft incense through the air; Their savory banquets shall the flocks refrain, Nor crop the velvet of the pasturing plain; No fostering showers from hence refresh the lawn, No pearly blessings cheer the parching dawn; The widow'd groves lost foliage shall deplore, And balmy zephyrs gather sweets no more: Thy George, O Albion! Heaven declines to spare, Bestow'd too long to prevalence of prayer; Albion! thy parent dies!—as bless'd a mind, As heaven could furnish to exalt mankind; Religion, mercy, peace, his steps attend, And numerous virtues all their lustres lend; His guide was truth, benevolence his road, His life, one effort of redundant good; No sword of violence protects a crime, Stains the clear page, or dims the golden time; No vice illustrious stalk'd behind the king, No shelter'd folly fledged beneath his wing; No ravenous grasp, no lawless lust of power, Sullies his life, or stains a single hour; So kindly just, the parent monarch sighs, And greatly pities, while the laws chastise: When Albion's safety would, how swift to save? (A deed for gods) he pitied and forgave: Large as his heart, the blessings he design'd; His godlike bounty deluged all mankind: Here he restrain'd the Indian's thirst of gore, And bid the murderous tomax drink no more; Crush'd faithless Gallia, with her savage train, Who foster factions, to disturb his reign; Stretch'd through these haunts the blessings of his sway, And pour'd on pagan darkness, beamy day; 'T is from his hand this tide of plenty flows, Thence learning buds, the infant of repose; 'T is he, whose wisdom crown'd the happiest reign, When patriots only, equal honors gain; Where all distinction was to vice denied, And patriot virtue spread its influence wide: No sons but virtue's, shone among the great, Nor less than Pitt, the pilot of the state. Nor civil virtues were his only claim, His early prowess won a martial fame: The victor wreath in dreadful fields he twined, And valor throned him monarch of mankind; Germania's realms his matchless courage boast, And clustering glories in his name are lost. Long was the blessing spared to Albion's cries, Loved by his realms, and ripening for the skies; In his full orb of majesty complete, He quits his earthly for a heavenly seat: Death, and death only, to such kings imparts A kingdom equal to their great deserts.” Here the full tide of grief his song suppress'd, And sighs and tears, instructive, spoke the rest. Amid the instant wreck, the laboring sigh, What glorious form commands the weeping eye? Pierced with a kingdom's woes, she leads the tear, The infections drop our lids are proud to wear; 'T is Albion's guardian! see, her glossy plume Darts a keen radiance through the withering gloom! Not Cynthia's beams with such effulgence flow, When her full disk gives all its broad below: High o'er the silver-skirted main she rose, And o'er a world in anguish smiled repose: She waves her hand, and points to Britain's throne, “George still survives, O Albion! all thy own: From deep despair, redemption he commands, And guides the sceptre with instructed hands.” New flush'd with life, the blooming forests rise, Shine with fresh green, and climb to taller skies; The warbling wantons through the dusky grove, Sweetly conspiring pour a waste of love; Perfumes from every breathing flower exhale, And balmy incense loads the fragrant gale; Their savory banquet lowing herds regain, Ranged on the velvet of the pasturing plain: On the bless'd theme the bard indulged him long, Then thus his raptures he attuned to song: “Thrice bless'd Britannia! heaven's peculiar care! Oft rescued in the moment of despair; Pangs but arrive e'er blessings swift pursue, We scarcely tremble, e'er we triumph too. How scourged! how lost! let Albion's groans inform; This western empire scarce survived the storm: Our ague fears, and enervating woe, Edged the keen vengeance of the insulting foe; But—snatch'd from fate, when to its stroke resign'd— Who dares despair? for heaven and George were kind. Then whilst with Albion we our joys contest, And pour our raptures in the monarch's breast; The distant blessing honor and approve, With secret avarice dwell upon his love; To listening skies our laboring breasts unload, And wrest new blessings from his conscious God; He dies. At this our bursting bosoms rave, And pain'd remembrance envied George his grave. “What kindly God presides? the tumults cease, This hour all tempest, and the next all peace; We smile, bless'd heaven! a George upon the throne, Another George, O Albion! all thy own; From deep despair a nation to redeem, And check our sorrows in their midway stream: He sways the sceptre, takes the glorious charge; Unbounded goodness now shall lord at large: His virtues blazon'd wide as fame can wing, And proud Britannia glories in her king. Blush, grandeur! blush, in all thy purple pride, True greatness is to goodness close allied: The worthy heart will ever claim esteem; O prince, thy virtue is thy brightest gem: Food for applause to distant realms dispense, Beyond the reach of poor magnificence; Blessings are tongued, and ever on the wing— A wondering world's a circle for a king. Joy to the realms where slavery was design'd, A Brunswick reigns, the guardian of mankind. While gay-eyed conquest rears his banners high, A flaming meteor in the Gallic sky. He bids his bolted thunders cease their roar; And offers peace to Gallia's faithless shore. Bless'd prince! whose unexampled goodness charms, Thy people's blessings be thy brightest arms: The base of empire is the king's desert, And merit is the monarch of the heart. Nor hostile worlds shall favorite George dethrone; Each Briton's breast's a barrier to his own. May one clear calm attend thee to thy close, One lengthen'd sunshine of complete repose: Correct our crimes, and beam that christian mind O'er the wide wreck of dissolute mankind; To calm brow'd peace, the maddening world restore, Or lash the demon thirsting still for gore; Till nature's utmost bound thy arms restrain, And prostrate tyrants bite the British chain. JAMES ALLEN. LINES ON THE MASSACRE. From realms of bondage, and a tyrant's reign, Our godlike fathers bore no slavish chain. To Pharaoh's face the inspired patriarchs stood, To seal their virtue, with a martyr's blood: But lives so precious, such a sacred seed, The source of empires, heaven's high will decreed; He snatch'd the saints from Pharaoh's impious hand, And bid his chosen seek this distant land: Thus to these climes the illustrious exiles sped, 'T was freedom prompted, and the Godhead led. Eternal woods the virgin soil defaced, A dreary desert, and a howling waste; The haunt of tribes no pity taught to spare, And they opposed them with remorseless war, But heaven's right arm led forth the faithful train, The guardian Godhead swept the insidious plain, Till the scour'd thicket amicable stood, Nor dastard ambush trench'd the dusky wood: Our sires then earn'd no more precarious bread, Nor 'midst alarms their frugal meals were spread. Fair boding hopes inured their hands to toil, And patriot virtue nursed the thriving soil, Nor scarce two ages have their periods run, Since o'er their culture smiled the genial sun; And now what states extend their fair domains, O'er fleecy mountains, and luxuriant plains! Where happy millions their own fields possess, No tyrant awes them, and no lords oppress; The hand of rule, divine discretion guides, And white-robed virtue o'er her path presides, Each policed order venerates the laws, And each, ingenuous, speaks in freedom's cause; Not Spartan spirit, nor the Roman name, The patriot's pride, shall rival these in fame; Here all the sweets that social life can know, From the full fount of civil sapience flow; Here golden Ceres clothes th' autumnal plain, And art's fair empress holds her new domain; Here angel Science spreads her lucid wing, And hark, how sweet the new-born muses sing; Here generous Commerce spreads her liberal hand, And scatters foreign blessings round the land. Shall meagre mammon, or proud lust of sway, Reverse these scenes—will heaven permit the day? Shall in this era all our hopes expire, And weeping freedom from her fanes retire? Here shall the tyrant still our peace pursue, From the pain'd eyebrow drink the vital dew? Not nature's barrier wards our father's foe, Seas roll in vain, and boundless oceans flow. Stay, Pharaoh, stay, that impious hand forbear, Nor tempt the genius of our souls too far; How oft, ungracious! in thy thankless stead, 'Mid scenes of death, our generous youth have bled; When the proud Gaul thy mightiest powers repell'd, And drove your legions trembling from the field, We rent the laurel from the victor's brow, And round your temples taught the wreath to grow, Say, when thy slaughter'd bands the desert dyed, Where lone Ohio rolls her gloomy tide, Whose dreary banks their wasting bones inshrine, What arm avenged them?—thankless! was it thine? But generous valor scorns a boasting word, And conscious virtue reaps her own reward, Yet conscious virtue bids thee now to speak, Though guilty blushes kindle o'er thy cheek: If wasting wars, and painful toils at length, Had drain'd our veins, and wither'd all our strength, How couldst thou, cruel, form the vile design, And round our necks the wreath of bondage twine! And if some lingering spirit roused to strife, Bid ruffian murder drink the dregs of life? Shall future ages e'er forget the deed? And shall n't for this imperious Britain bleed? When comes the period heaven predestines must, When Europe's glories shall be whelm'd in dust, When our proud fleets the naval wreath shall wear, And o'er her empires hurl the bolts of war, Unnerved by fate, the boldest heart shall fail, And 'mid their guards auxiliar kings grow pale; In vain shall Britain lift her suppliant eye, An alien'd offspring feels no filial tie, Her tears in vain shall bathe the soldier's feet, Remember, ingrate, Boston's crimson'd street; Whole hecatombs of lives the deed shall pay, And purge the murders of that guilty day. But why to future periods look so far, What force e'er faced us, that we fear'd to dare? Then, canst thou think, e'en on this early day, Proud force shall bend us to a tyrant's sway? A foreign foe opposed our sword in vain, And thine own troops we 've rallied on the plain, If then our lives thy lawless sword invade, Think'st thou, enslaved, we 'd kiss the pointed blade? Nay, let experience speak—be this the test, 'T is from experience that we reason best. When first thy mandate show'd the shameless plan, To rank our race beneath the class of man, Low as the brute to sink the human line, Our toil our portion, and the harvest thine, Modest but firm, we plead the sacred cause, On nature based, and sanction'd by the laws; But your deaf ear the conscious plea denied, Some demon counsel'd—and the sword replied; Your navy then our haven cover'd o'er, And arm'd battalions trespass'd on our shore. Through the prime streets, they march'd in war's array, At noon's full blaze, and in the face of day: With dumb contempt we pass'd the servile show, While scorn's proud spirit scowl'd on every brow; Day after day successive wrongs we bore, Till patience, wearied, could support no more, Till slaughter'd lives our native streets profaned, And thy slave's hand our hallow'd crimson stain'd, No sudden rage the ruffian soldier tore, Or swam the pavement with his vital gore. Deliberate thought did all our souls compose, Till veil'd in glooms the lowery morning rose; No mob then furious urged the impassion'd fray, Nor clamorous tumult dinn'd the solemn day. In full convene the city senate sate, Our fathers' spirit ruled the firm debate;— The freeborn soul no reptile tyrant checks, 'T is heaven dictates when the people speaks; Loud from their tongues the awful mandate broke, And thus inspired, the sacred senate spoke; “Ye miscreant troops, begone! Our presence fly, Stay, if ye dare, but if ye dare, ye die!” “Ah! too severe,” the fearful chief replies, “Permit one half—the other instant flies.”— “No parle, avaunt, or by our fathers' shades, Your reeking lives shall glut our vengeful blades, Ere morning's light begone,—or else we swear, Each slaughter'd corse shall feed the birds of air!” Ere morning's light had streak'd the skies with red, The chieftain yielded, and the soldier fled. 'T is thus experience speaks—the test forbear, Nor show these states your feeble front of war, But still your navies lord it o'er the main, Their keels are natives of our oaken plain; E'en the proud mast that bears your flag on high, Grew on our soil, and ripen'd in our sky: “Know then thyself, presume not us to scan,” Your power precarious, and your isle a span. Yet could our wrongs in just oblivion sleep, And on each neck revived affection weep, The brave are generous, and the good forgive, Then say you 've wrong'd us, and our parent live; But face not fate, oppose not heaven's decree, Let not that curse, our mother, light on thee. THE RETROSPECT. Her warlike sons the palm of victory bore, Where hoary Neptune's utmost billows roar, More far than Rome who ruled unnumber'd kings, Where Cæsar's eagles never stretch'd their wings, From Polar climes where daylight scarcely gleams, To where full Phœbus pours his torrid beams, Where gorgeous Asia spreads the sumptuous loom, Or stately nabobs rear the princely dome, Where arid Afric gives to foreign toil Her pearly rivers and her golden soil, Far as the sachem roams the loneliest wood, Or tempts with venturous barque Ontario's flood, To where fair Europe's vernal regions rise In medial climates, and in temperate skies. The British powers for seven successive years, Had thus triumphant circled both the spheres, O'er the whole globe their course of glory run Whence day emerges to where sets the sun. No waste of life pollutes the soldier's deed, Nor wanton spoliage bids reflection bleed. Barbarian ravage hung the pagan car, The spoils of empires, and the waste of war, In fields of death did Cæsar's laurels bloom, And shamed the triumphs of imperial Rome, Whose wreath renown'd to mightier Timur yields, Famed for the feats of more illustrious fields. He, half the world in one great day withstood, And bid the rising crescent set in blood. From tyrant power preserved the realms of Greece, And o'er Byzantium stretched the palm of peace. Yet conquer'd kings in chains inglorious led, And captive queens with sordid offal fed. Not so the Briton gleans the field of war, Nor such the trophies of a Brunswick's car; No frown of danger daunts his fearless eye, Where the fight storms, and where the bravest die. But when the thunder of the battle's o'er, And adverse legions tempt their fate no more, His heart humane regrets a hero's deeds, And for the foe his generous bosom bleeds! A sanguine spirit fires the soldier slave, But manly pity ever warms the brave. Say! round the circuit of this spacious earth, What barbarous act degrades the warrior's worth? Through the vast regions stretch'd from either pole, What aching bosom, or what anguish'd soul? Doth hoary age a single solace mourn, Or from whose breasts are tender nurslings torn? What spouse bewails the bridal bed profaned, Or what fond youth the plighted virgin stain'd? What hostile fires the rural works consume, Or waste the labors of the ingenious loom? Still the blithe swain enjoys his fleecy care, And still the lover woos the spotless fair, Still nuptial life connubial virtues bless, And parent bosoms the sweet babe compress. Her hallow'd courts no vulgar trophy soils, No rapined gold, nor unillustrious spoils; Great Brunswick's eye dejected Bourborn waits, And India's monarchs throng Augusta's gates, Whole maps of conquest all the war reveal, And at her side the vanquish'd princes kneel, Till peace, fair goddess, spreads her balmy wings, And grace benignly lifts the prostrate kings: The kings arise, the gates of Janus close, And Britain gives the weary world repose; Now casts her eye through every various zone, And counts a hundred different climes her own. Here, right of conquest pleads a boon to fame, And here, the sword prescribes the sovereign's claim. Not so, endear'd by nature's kindly tie, Beloved Columbia meets her parent's eye, Pleased she surveys her darling's fair domains, Her fleecy mountains, and her bearded plains, Where peace and plenty rule with union sway, Where Britain's genius beams politic day. Ah! seats of Eden, nature's care in vain! Bright as thy sons, and as thy heavens serene! Unbless'd, amid the circling course of clime, In spring's fair bloom, or autumn's golden prime, Though fruits luxuriant crown the reaper's toil, Or flowers spontaneous deck the enamel'd soil, Though flocks and herds innumerable teem, And silver Naiads sport in every stream, Did Britain now a mother's aid deny, Or Brunswick pass thee with regardless eye? When peopling regions wear a various face, And laws ill-system'd ask a broader base, When thoughtful senates feel a patriot's care, And lift to gracious George the wishful prayer, When some ill genii, guised in friendly form, Might dark and subtile mix the civil storm, With specious art aerial codes prepare, And in the senate stretch the stygian snare; The infernal magic spell her palsied voice, Perplex'd—confounded, 'midst a maze of choice; Whilst all without to heights anarchial wrought, The pomp of passion, or the pride of thought, Till vulgar councils sit in bold debate, And votes plebeian awe the wayward state, Then factious fires the impassion'd heart might feel, And rage delirious with fantastic zeal. Till civil fury give the impious blow, And brother's blood in mingling currents flow! Till kindred carnage heap the humid vale, And loathed effluvia taint the passing gale: But days so dire no son of thine shall see, So George resolves, and such is heaven's decree. O! precious offspring of the queen of Isles, Nursed in the sunbeam of thy mother's smiles. Henceforth no vulgar tongue profanely dare The bench to dictate or control the bar! On adamantine base the Judge shall stand, And deal out justice with a fearless hand; Each villain's heart the dread tribunals awe, And nature's sanctions form the sageful law, The sovereign's fiat guide the policed poise, As life grows social, and new interests rise. Through the mixt mazes of contingent cause Dart the keen glance and spirit all the laws. The state's great genius, whose magnific soul Conducts, protects, and constitutes the whole. Hail, times illustrious! blissful era, hail! When patriot princes hold the public scale, With eye judicious range the walks of state, From the coarse peasant to the purpled great. Shall base-born faction, nurtured up in crimes, Malign the laws, or fault the halcyon times? Against the throne uprear the factious brand, And bid the vulgar madden round the land? With black illusion pest the public ear, And spread his spells infectious demon here? Still o'er thy realms, paternal prince, preside, The sovereign reason, and thy people's guide. Aloft in air the golden standards play, Standards erst spread to many a glorious day, When Britain's host the illustrious Marlborough led, When Tallard yielded, or when Berwick bled, Standards, no hostile hand shall dare profane, Nor e'er be trampled on the carnaged plain, Their sacred shade the soldier's soul inspires, Nerves his whole heart, and kindles all his fires. The embattled war to martial music moves Through long known vales, and oft frequented groves, To the clift skirt coast that girds fair Albion's reign, On whose broad margin swells the ambient main. Here the big heart is seen to breathe a sigh, And the salt tear to scald the soldier's eye; Not that his sire betrays a parent's pangs, Or round his neck the spoused virgin hangs; To these, to all, he freely bids adieu, But every fear, Columbia, is for you. For you he braves the storm, with dauntless soul, Sees the surge burst, or mountain billow roll, Through the long voyage unnumber'd perils past, Safely he makes Cape Breton's coast at last: Ah! Lewis, start, dire dreams thy sleep invade, Here falls thy favorite, here thy lilies fade. A mint of cost in vain her ramparts rear'd, And her proud walls thy best battalions guard. Thy name, presumptuous prince, in vain she wears, And heaves her haughty bulwarks to the stars. Her period 's come, now shines the fated day, When all her glories in the dust shall lay. But ah! what havock strews her stormy shore, And floats her flowery fields with floods of gore? Ere the last gasp, ere the decisive groan, When British valor wins the important town. Ye youth, who glorious to the battle bled, And you by fate to future fame decreed, Now from the roving corsair's ravage free, The rich fraught vessels course the peaceful sea; On the broad bank the fisher feels no fear, New Albion thanks ye with a grateful tear. “You whom the duties of the day can spare, In manly mirth the grateful banquet share, Nor bids your chief refrain the rustic's toil, What generous victor stains his hands with spoil? A deed so base may suit the armed slave, But piteous pillage misbecomes the brave.” The general thus, the troops in shouts reply, The echoing plaudit thunders to the sky. The genial supper spreads the unsullied green, The bowl convivial crowns the festive scene. In pleasing talk the guiltless eve they pass, In social circles on the fragrant grass, Till soft each eye salubrious slumbers close, They sink unconscious in serene repose. No dreary dream, nor morphean dozes steep The soldiers' senses in abortive sleep. Soon as the cheerly goddess of the morn From her light pinion sheds the silver dawn, Each placid brow the kind oblivion flies, And fresh as day the invigor'd warriors rise. AN INTENDED INSCRIPTION FOR THE MONUMENT ON BEACON-HILL, IN BOSTON. Where stretch'd your sail, beneath what foreign sky Did lovelier landscape ever charm your eye? Could fancy's fairy pencil, stranger! say, E'en dipt in dreams, a nobler scene pourtray? Behold yon vales, whose skirts elude your view, And mountains fading to aerial blue! Along their bowery shades how healthy toil Alternate sports, or tends the mellow soil. See rural towns 'mid groves and gardens rise, And eastward,—where the stretching ocean lies, Lo! our fair capital sublimes the scene, New Albion's pride, and ocean's future queen; How o'er the tradeful port august she smiles,— Her sea-like haven boasts an hundred isles, When hardy commerce swell the lofty sails O'er arctic seas, and mocks the polar gales; Thence tides of wealth the wafting breezes bring, And hence e'en culture feels its vital spring. These scenes our sires from rugged nature wrought, Since—what dire wars their patriot race have fought! Witness yon tract, where first the Briton bled, Driven by our youth redoubted Percy fled: There Breed ascends, and Bunker's bleeding steeps, Still o'er whose brow abortive victory weeps; What trophies since! the gaze of after times, Rear'd freedom's empire o'er our happy climes! But hence, fond stranger, take a nobler view, See yon shorn elm, The stump of liberty tree. whence all these glories grew. Here, where the armed foe presumptuous trod, Trampled our shrines, and even mouth'd our God, His vengeful hand, deep as the parent root, Lopt each grown branch, and every suckling shoot; Because beneath her consecrated shade Our earliest vows to liberty were paid. High from her altar blew the heaven-caught fire, While all our wealth o'erhung the kindling pyre. How at the deed the nations stood aghast, As on the pile our plighted lives we cast! O! if an alien from our fair domains, The blood of Britain, hapless, taint your veins, Pace o'er that hallow'd ground with awful tread, And tears, atoning, o'er yon relic shed; But if, American! your lineage springs, From sires, who scorn the pedigree of kings, A Georgian born, you breathe the tepid air, Or on the breezy banks of Delaware, Or hardy Hampshire claim your haughty birth, Revere yon root, and kiss its nurturing earth: O be its fibres fed by flowing springs, Whence rose our empire o'er the thrones of kings: E'en now descend, adore the dear remain, Where first rear'd liberty's illumin'd fane. There all her race, while time revolves, shall come, As pilgrims flock to Mecca's idol'd tomb. ON WASHINGTON'S VISIT TO BOSTON. 1789. Did human eye e'er see so fair a day? Behold thy genius, freedom, lead the way. Rude kings of old did Russian armies wait, And swell with barb'rous port the pomp of state. While the proud car, bedeck'd with guilty gold, On freedom's writhing neck triumphant roll'd. The nobles proud, who led the gorgeous train, Wore slavery's badge and drew a gilded chain, While the loud shouts which pierced the troubled air, The tongue of nations, only thrilled with fear. The eye adoring, scarce could check its flow, For all their trophies swell'd but human wo. The paths of triumph thus the nations trod, And thought the sovereign power derived from God. Hence o'er the historic roll what hateful crimes Were wrought, the model of succeeding times. But now fair liberty illumes the age, And reason tints renown's recording page, Blots from her eye the fierce barbarian's name, And even Cæsar blurs the page of fame. Who wrought the wond'rous change? what power divine? The wond'rous change, O Washington! was thine. 'T is thine own era graced the radiant page, The fostering parent of a filial age. Thou too, illustrious Hancock, by his side In every lowering hour of danger tried, With him conspicuous o'er the beamy page, Descend the theme of every future age. When first the sword of early war we drew, The king presaging fix'd his eye on you. T was your dread finger press'd the sacred seal, Whence rose to sovereign power the public weal. Then, Washington! Oh dearly honor'd name, From callow youth the favorite of fame, When hovering navies, haughty Albion's boast, Pour'd her dread armies o'er our trembling coast, Your country beck'd you from the rural bower, And nerved your mighty arm with all her power. The tyrant saw, and sickening at the view, In fancy bade his frantic hopes adieu. But urged by fate, still bade his armies dare, Blew the vain trump, and waged abortive war. At length you drew the tyrant from his throne, And bade his seal your course of glory crown. When polish'd wisdom seem'd her seats to fly, On thee again the public cast her eye. How rose the model from your forming hand! The proud palladium of our happy land. Ah! gentle parent of the cradled states, On whose fond eye an infant nation waits, While now affection seems your steps to stay, And swarming concourse checks your laboring way; Perhaps among the loud acclaiming throng, Your ear may heed the muse's transient song; The high-born muse from adulation free, Attunes, Oh chief! her haughty lyre to thee. No vulgar theme could ever tempt her strain, Perhaps the proudest of the tuneful train. Apart from busy life her hours are led, And her lone steps the shades of science tread. Her years revolving roll a playful flow, Nor ever care o'erhung the muse's brow. From the recess where her own roses twine, How oft her fancy drew a form like thine. Ere morning waked she wing'd her early way To hail the dawn of this auspicious day. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN. PAPER. Some wit of old—such wits of old there were— Whose hints show'd meaning, whose allusions care, By one brave stroke to mark all human kind, Call'd clear blank paper every infant mind; Where still, as opening sense her dictates wrote, Fair virtue put a seal, or vice a blot. The thought was happy, pertinent, and true; Methinks a genius might the plan pursue. I (can you pardon my presumption?) I— No wit, no genius, yet for once will try. Various the papers various wants produce, The wants of fashion, elegance, and use. Men are as various; and if right I scan, Each sort of paper represents some man. Pray note the fop—half powder and half lace— Nice as a band-box were his dwelling-place: He 's the gilt paper, which apart you store, And lock from vulgar hands in the 'scrutoire. Mechanics, servants, farmers, and so forth, Are copy-paper, of inferior worth; Less prized, more useful, for your desk decreed, Free to all pens, and prompt at every need. The wretch, whom avarice bids to pinch and spare, Starve, cheat, and pilfer, to enrich an heir, Is coarse brown paper; such as pedlars choose To wrap up wares, which better men will use. Take next the miser's contrast, who destroys Health, fame, and fortune, in a round of joys. Will any paper match him? Yes, throughout, He 's a true sinking-paper, past all doubt. The retail politician's anxious thought Deems this side always right, and that stark naught; He foams with censure; with applause he raves— A dupe to rumors, and a tool of knaves; He'll want no type his weakness to proclaim, While such a thing as foolscap has a name. The hasty gentleman, whose blood runs high, Who picks a quarrel, if you step awry, Who can't a jest, or hint, or look endure: What is he? What? Touch-paper to be sure. What are our poets, take them as they fall, Good, bad, rich, poor, much read, not read at all? Them and their works in the same class you'll find; They are the mere waste-paper of mankind. Observe the maiden, innocently sweet, She 's fair white-paper, an unsullied sheet; On which the happy man, whom fate ordains, May write his name, and take her for his pains. One instance more, and only one I'll bring; 'T is the great man who scorns a little thing, Whose thoughts, whose deeds, whose maxims are his own, Form'd on the feelings of his heart alone: True genuine royal-paper is his breast: Of all the kinds most precious, purest, best. JOHN TRUMBULL. M'FINGAL. CANTO III. Now warm with ministerial ire, Fierce sallied forth our loyal 'squire, And on his striding steps attends His desperate clan of tory friends. When sudden met his wrathful eye A pole ascending through the sky, Which numerous throngs of whiggish race Were raising in the market-place. Not higher school-boys' kites aspire, Or royal mast, or country spire; Like spears at Brobdignagian tilting, Or Satan's walking-staff in Milton. And on its top, the flag unfurl'd Waved triumph o'er the gazing world, Inscribed with inconsistent types Of liberty and thirteen stripes. Beneath, the crowd without delay The dedication-rites essay, And gladly pay, in ancient fashion, The ceremonies of libation; While briskly to each patriot lip Walks eager round the inspiring flip: Delicious draught! whose powers inherit The quintessence of public spirit; Which whoso tastes, perceives his mind To nobler politics refined; Or roused to martial controversy, As from transforming cups of Circe; Or warm'd with Homer's nectar'd liquor, That fill'd the veins of gods with ichor. At hand for new supplies in store, The tavern opes its friendly door, Whence to and fro the waiters run, Like bucket-men at fires in town. Then with three shouts that tore the sky, 'T is consecrate to liberty. To guard it from the attacks of tories, A grand committee cull'd of four is; Who foremost on the patriot spot, Had brought the flip, and paid the shot. By this, M'Fingal with his train Advanced upon the adjacent plain, And full with loyalty possess'd, Pour'd forth the zeal that fired his breast. “What mad-brain'd rebel gave commission, To raise this May-pole of sedition? Like Babel, rear'd by bawling throngs, With like confusion too of tongues, To point at heaven, and summon down The thunders of the British crown? Say, will this paltry pole secure Your forfeit heads from Gage's power? Attack'd by heroes brave and crafty, Is this to stand your ark of safety; Or driven by Scottish laird and laddie, Think ye to rest beneath its shadow? When bombs, like fiery serpents, fly, And balls rush hissing through the sky, Will this vile pole, devote to freedom, Save like the Jewish pole in Edom; Or like the brazen snake of Moses, Cure your crack'd sculls and batter'd noses? “Ye dupes to every factious rogue And tavern-prating demagogue, Whose tongue but rings, with sound more full, On the empty drumhead of his scull; Behold you not what noisy fools Use you, worse simpletons, for tools? For liberty, in your own by-sense, Is but for crimes a patent license, To break of law the Egyptian yoke, And throw the world in common stock; Reduce all grievances and ills To Magna Charta of your wills; Establish cheats, and frauds, and nonsense, Framed to the model of your conscience; Cry justice down, as out of fashion, And fix its scale of depreciation; Defy all creditors to trouble ye, And keep new years of Jewish jubilee; Drive judges out, like Aaron's calves, By jurisdiction of white staves, And make the bar, and bench, and steeple, Submit t' our sovereign lord, the people: By plunder rise to power and glory, And brand all property, as tory; Expose all wares to lawful seizures By mobbers or monopolizers; Break heads, and windows, and the peace, For your own interest and increase; Dispute, and pray, and fight, and groan, For public good, and mean your own; Prevent the law by fierce attacks From quitting scores upon your backs; Lay your old dread, the gallows, low, And seize the stocks, your ancient foe, And turn them to convenient engines To wreak your patriotic vengeance; While all, your rights who understand, Confess them in their owner's hand; And when by clamors and confusions, Your freedom's grown a public nuisance, Cry ‘liberty,’ with powerful yearning, As he does ‘fire!’ whose house is burning; Though he already has much more Than he can find occasion for. While every clown; that tills the plains, Though bankrupt in estate and brains, By this new light transform'd to traitor, Forsakes his plough to turn dictator, Starts an haranguing chief of whigs, And drags you by the ears, like pigs, All bluster, arm'd with factious license, New-born at once to politicians. Each leather-apron dunce, grown wise, Presents his forward face t' advise, And tatter'd legislators meet, From every workshop through the street. His goose the tailor finds new use in, To patch and turn the Constitution; The blacksmith comes with sledge and grate To iron-bind the wheels of state; The quack forbears his patient's souse, To purge the council and the house; The tinker quits his moulds and doxies, To cast assembly-men and proxies, From dunghills deep of blackest hue, Your dirt-bred patriots spring to view, To wealth and powers and honors rise, Like new-wing'd maggots changed to flies, And fluttering round in high parade, Strut in the robe, or gay cockade. See Arnold quits, for ways more certain, His bankrupt-perj'ries for his fortune, Brews rum no longer in his store, Jocky and skipper now no more: And cleansed by patriotism from shame, Grows General of the foremost name. For in this ferment of the stream The dregs have work'd up to the brim, And by the rule of topsy-turvies, The scum stands foaming on the surface. You 've caused your pyramid t' ascend, And set it on the little end. Like Hudibras your empire 's made, Whose crupper had o'ertopp'd his head. You 've push'd and turn'd the whole world up- Side down, and got yourselves at top, While all the great ones of your state Are crush'd beneath the popular weight; Nor can you boast, this present hour, The shadow of the form of power. For what's your Congress or its end? A power t' advise and recommend; To call forth troops, adjust your quotas— And yet no soul is bound to notice; To pawn your faith to the utmost limit, But cannot bind you to redeem it; And when in want, no more in them lies, Than begging from your state assemblies; Can utter oracles of dread, Like friar Bacon's brazen head, But when a faction dares dispute 'em, Has ne'er an arm to execute 'em: As though you chose supreme dictators, And put them under conservators. You 've but pursued the self-same way With Shakespeare's Trinc'lo in the play; “You shall be viceroys here, 't is true, But we'll be viceroys over you.” What wild confusion hence must ensue? Though common danger yet cements yon: So some wreck'd vessel, all in shatters, Is held up by surrounding waters, But stranded, when the pressure ceases, Falls by its rottenness to pieces. And fall it must! if wars were ended, You'll ne'er have sense enough to mend it: But creeping on, by low intrigues, Like vermin of a thousand legs, 'T will find as short a life assign'd, As all things else of reptile kind. Your Commonwealth 's a common harlot, The property of every varlet; Which now in taste, and full employ, All sorts admire, as all enjoy: But soon a batter'd strumpet grown, You'll curse and drum her out of town. Such is the government you chose; For this you bade the world be foes; For this, so mark'd for dissolution, You scorn the British Constitution, That Constitution form'd by sages, The wonder of all modern ages; Which owns no failure in reality, Except corruption and venality; And merely proves the adage just, That best things spoil'd corrupt to worst: So man supreme in earthly station, And mighty lord of this creation, When once his corse is dead as herring, Becomes the most offensive carrion, And sooner breeds the plague, 't is found, Than all beasts rotting on the ground. Yet with republics to dismay us, You 've call'd up Anarchy from chaos, With all the followers of her school, Uproar, and rage, and wild misrule: For whom this rout of whigs distracted, And ravings dire of every crack'd head; These new-cast legislative engines Of county meetings and conventions; Committees vile of correspondence, And mobs, whose tricks have almost undone's: While reason fails to check your course, And loyality 's kick'd out of doors, And folly, like inviting landlord, Hoists on your poles her royal standard; While the king's friends, in doleful dumps, Have worn their courage to the stumps, And leaving George in sad disaster, Most sinfully deny their master. What furies raged when you, in sea, In shape of Indians, drown'd the tea; When your gay sparks, fatigued to watch it, Assumed the moggison and hachet, With wampum'd blankets hid their laces, And like their sweethearts, primed their faces: While not a red-coat dared oppose, And scarce a tory showed his nose While Hutchinson, for sure retreat, Manœuvred to his country seat, And thence affrighted, in the suds, Stole off bareheaded through the woods. “Have you not roused your mobs to join, And make Mandamus-men resign, Call'd forth each duffil-dress'd curmudgeon, With dirty trousers and white bludgeon, Forced all our councils through the land, To yield their necks at your command; While paleness marks their late disgraces, Through all their rueful length of faces? “Have you not caused us woful work In our good city of New York, When all the rabble, well cockaded, In triumph through the streets paraded, And mobb'd the tories, scared their spouses, And ransack'd all the custom-houses; Made such a tumult, bluster, jarring, That 'mid the clash of tempests warring, Smith's weather-cock, in veers forlorn, Could hardly tell which way to turn? Burn'd effiges of higher powers, Contrived in planetary hours; As witches with clay-images Destroy or torture whom they please: Till fired with rage, the effulgent club Spared not your best friend, Beelzebub, O'erlook'd his favors, and forgot The reverence due his cloven foot, And in the selfsame furnace frying, Stew'd him, and North, and Bute, and Tryon? Did you not, in as vile and shallow way, Fright our poor Philadelphian, Galloway, Your Congress, when the loyal ribald Belied, berated and bescribbled? What ropes and halters did you send, Terrific emblems of his end, Till, lest he 'd hang in more than effigy, Fled in a fog the trembling refugee? Now rising in progression fatal, Have you not ventured to give battle? When treason chased our heroes troubled, With rusty gun, and leathern doublet; Turn'd all stone walls, and groves, and bushes, To batteries arm'd with blunderbusses; And with deep wounds, that fate portend, Gall'd many a Briton's latter end; Drove them to Boston, as in jail, Confined without mainprize or bail. Were not these deeds enough betimes, To heap the measure of your crimes: But in this loyal town and dwelling, You raise these ensigns of rebellion? 'T is done! fair mercy shuts her door; And vengeance now shall sleep no more. Rise then, my friends, in terror rise, And sweep this scandal from the skies. You'll see their Dagon, though well jointed, Will shrink before the Lord's anointed; And like old Jericho's proud wall, Before our ram's horns prostrate fall.” This said, our 'Squire, yet undismay'd, Call'd forth the constable to aid, And bade him read, in nearer station, The riot-act and proclamation. He swift, advancing to the ring, Began, “Our sovereign lord, the king”— When thousand clamorous tongues he hears, And clubs and stones assail his ears. To fly was vain, to fight was idle; By foes encompassed in the middle, His hope, in stratagems, he found, And fell right craftily to ground; Then crept to seek an hiding place, 'T was all he could, beneath a brace; Where soon the conquering crew espied him, And where he lurk'd, they caught and tied him. At once with resolution fatal, Both whigs and tories rush'd to battle. Instead of weapons, either band Seized on such arms as came to hand. And as famed Ovid paints the adventures Of wrangling Lapithæ and Centaurs, Who at their feast, by Bacchus led, Threw bottles at each other's head; And these arms failing in their scuffles, Attack'd with andirons, tongs and shovels, So clubs and billets, staves and stones Met fierce, encountering every sconce, And covered o'er with knobs and pains Each void receptacle for brains, Their clamors rend the skies around, The hills rebellow to the sound; And many a groan increased the din From batter'd nose and broken shin. M'Fingal, rising at the word, Drew forth his old militia-sword; Thrice cried “King George,” as erst in distress, Knights of romance invoked a mistress; And brandishing the blade in air, Struck terror through the opposing war. The whigs, unsafe within the wind Of such commotion, shrunk behind. With whirling steel around address'd, Fierce through their thickest throng he press'd, (Who roll'd on either side in arch, Like Red Sea waves in Israel's march) And like a meteor rushing through, Struck on their pole a vengeful blow. Around, the whigs, of clubs and stones Discharged whole volleys in platoons, That o'er in whistling fury fly; But not a foe dares venture nigh. And now perhaps with glory crown'd Our 'Squire had fell'd the pole to ground, Had not some power, a whig at heart, Descended down and took their part; (Whether 't were Pallas, Mars or Iris, 'T is scarce worth while to make inquiries) Who at the nick of time alarming, Assumed the solemn form of chairman, Addressed a whig, in every scene The stoutest wrestler on the green, And pointed where the spade was found, Late used to set their pole in ground, And urged, with equal arms and might, To dare our 'Squire to single fight. The whig thus arm'd, untaught to yield, Advanced tremendous to the field: Nor did M'Fingal shun the foe, But stood to brave the desperate blow; While all the party gazed, suspended To see the deadly combat ended; And Jove in equal balance weigh'd The sword against the brandish'd spade: He weigh'd; but lighter than a dream, The sword flew up, and kick'd the beam. Our 'Squire on tiptoe rising fair Lifts high a noble stroke in air, Which hung not, but like dreadful engines, Descended on his foe in vengeance. But ah! in danger, with dishonor The sword perfidious fails its owner; That sword, which oft had stood its ground, By huge trainbands encircled round; And on the bench, with blade right loyal, Had won the day at many a trial, Of stones and clubs had braved the alarms, Shrunk from these new Vulcanian arms. The spade so temper'd from the sledge, Nor keen nor solid harm'd its edge, Now met it, from his arm of might, Descending with steep force to smite; The blade snapp'd short—and from his hand, With rust embrown'd the glittering sand. Swift turn'd M'Fingal at the view, And call'd to aid the attendant crew, In vain; the tories all had run, When scarce the fight was well begun; Their setting wigs he saw decreased Far in the horizon toward the west. Amazed he view'd the shameful sight, And saw no refuge, but in flight; But age unwieldly check'd his pace, Though fear had wing'd his flying race; For not a trifling prize at stake; No less than great M'Fingal's back. With legs and arms he work'd his course, Like rider that outgoes his horse, And labor'd hard to get away, as Old Satan struggling on through chaos; Till looking back, he spied in rear The spade-arm'd chief advanced too near: Then stopp'd and seized a stone, that lay An ancient landmark near the way; Nor shall we, as old bards have done, Affirm it weigh'd an hundred ton; But such a stone, as at a shift A modern might suffice to lift, Since men, to credit their enigmas, Are dwindled down to dwarfs and pigmies, And giants exiled with their cronies To Brobdignags and Patagonias. But while our hero turn'd him round, And tugg'd to raise it from the ground, The fatal spade discharged a blow Tremendous on his rear below: His bent knee fail'd, and void of strength Stretch'd on the ground his manly length. Like ancient oak o'erturn'd, he lay, Or tower to tempests fallen a prey, Or mountains sunk with all his pines, Or flower the plough to dust consigns, And more things else—but all men know 'em, If slightly versed in epic poem. At once the crew, at this dread crisis, Fall on, and bind him, ere he rises; And with loud shouts and joyful soul, Conduct him prisoner to the pole. When now the mob in lucky hour Had got their enemies in their power, They first proceed, by grave command, To take the constable in hand. Then from the pole's sublimest top The active crew let down the rope, At once its other end in haste bind, And make it fast upon his waistband; Till like the earth, as stretch'd on tenter, He hung self-balanced on his centre. Then upwards, all hands hoisting sail, They swung him, like a keg of ale, Till to the pinnacle in height He vaulted, like balloon or kite. As Socrates of old at first did To aid philosophy get hoisted, And found his thoughts flow strangely clear, Swung in a basket in mid air: Our culprit thus, in purer sky, With like advantage raised his eye, And looking forth in prospect wide, His tory errors clearly spied, And from his elevated station, With bawling voice began addressing. “Good gentlemen, and friends, and kin, For heaven's sake hear, if not for mine! I here renounce the Pope, the Turks, The king, the devil, and all their works; And will, set me but once at ease, Turn whig or Christian, what you please; And always mind your rules so justly, Should I live long as old Methus'lah, I'll never join in British rage, Nor help Lord North, nor General Gage; Nor lift my gun in future fights, Nor take away your charter-rights; Nor overcome your new-raised levies, Destroy your towns, nor burn your navies; Nor cut your poles down while I've breath, Though raised more thick than hatchel-teeth: But leave king George and all his elves To do their conquering work themselves.” This said, they lower'd him down in state, Spread at all points, like falling cat; But took a vote first on the question, That they 'd accept this full confession, And to their fellowship and favor, Restore him on his good behaviour. Not so our 'Squire submits to rule, But stood, heroic as a mule. “You'll find it all in vain,” quoth he, “To play your rebel tricks on me. All punishments, the world can render, Serve only to provoke the offender; The will gains strength from treatment horrid, As hides grow harder when they're curried. No man e'er felt the halter draw, With good opinion of the law; Or held in method orthodox His love of justice, in the stocks; Or fail'd to lose by sheriffs' shears At once his loyalty and ears. Have you made Murray look less big, Or smoked old Williams to a whig? Did our mobb'd Oliver quit his station, Or heed his vows of resignation? Has Rivington, in dread of stripes, Ceased lying since you stole his types? And can you think my faith will alter, By tarring, whipping, or the halter? I'll stand the worst; for recompense I trust king George and Providence. And when with conquest gain'd I come, Array'd in law and terror home, Ye'll rue this inauspicious morn, And curse the day when ye were born, In Job's high style of imprecations, With all his plagues, without his patience.” Meanwhile, beside the pole, the guard A bench of justice had prepared, Where sitting round in awful sort The grand committee hold their court; While all the crew, in silent awe, Wait from their lips the lore of law. Few moments with deliberation They hold the solemn consultation; When soon in judgment all agree, And clerk proclaims the dread decree; “That 'Squire M'Fingal having grown The vilest tory in the town, And now in full examination Convicted by his own confession, Finding no tokens of repentance, This court proceeds to render sentence: That first the mob a slip-knot single Tie round the neck of said M'Fingal, And in due form do tar him next, And feather, as the law directs; Then through the town attendant ride him In cart with constable beside him, And having held him up to shame, Bring to the pole, from whence he came.” Forthwith the crowd proceed to deck With halter'd noose M'Fingal's neck, While he in peril of his soul Stood tied half-hanging to the pole; Then lifting high the ponderous jar, Pour'd o'er his head the smoking tar. With less profusion once was spread Oil on the Jewish monarch's head, That down his beard and vestments ran, And cover'd all his outward man. As when (so Claudian sings) the gods And earth-born giants fell at odds, The stout Enceladus in malice Tore mountains up to throw at Pallas; And while he held them o'er his head, The river, from their fountains fed, Pour'd down his back its copious tide, And wore its channels in his hide: So from the high-raised urn the torrents Spread down his side their various currents; His flowing wig, as next the brim, First met and drank the sable stream; Adown his visage stern and grave Roll'd and adhered the viscid wave; With arms depending as he stood, Each cuff capacious holds the flood; From nose and chin's remotest end, The tarry icicles descend; Till all o'erspread, with colors gay, He glitter'd to the western ray, Like sleet-bound trees in wintry skies, Or Lapland idol carved in ice. And now the feather'd bag display'd Is waved in triumph o'er his head, And clouds him o'er with feathers missive, And down, upon the tar, adhesive: Not Maia's son, with wings for ears, Such plumage round his visage wears; Nor Milton's six-wing'd angel gathers Such superfluity of feathers. Now all complete appears our 'Squire, Like Gorgon or Chimæra dire; Nor more could boast on Plato's plan To rank among the race of man, Or prove his claim to human nature, As a two-legg'd, unfeather'd creature. Then on the fatal cart, in state They raised our grand Duumvirate, And as at Rome a like committee, Who found an owl within their city, With solemn rites and grave processions At every shrine perform'd lustrations; And lest infection might take place From such grim fowl with feather'd face, All Rome attends him through the street In trumph to his country seat: With like devotion all the choir Paraded round our awful 'Squire; In front the martial music comes Of horns and fiddles, fifes and drums, With jingling sound of carriage bells, And treble creak of rusted wheels. Behind, the crowd, in lengthen'd row With proud procession closed the show. And at fit periods every throat Combined in universal shout; And hail'd great liberty in chorus, Or bawl'd ‘confusion to the tories.’ Not louder storm the welkin braves From clamors of conflicting waves; Less dire in Lybian wilds the noise When ravening lions lift their voice; Or triumphs at town-meetings made, On passing votes to regulate trade. Thus having borne them round the town, Last at the pole they set them down; And to the tavern take their way To end in mirth the festal day. And now the mob, dispersed and gone, Left 'Squire and constable alone. The constable with rueful face Lean'd sad and solemn o'er a brace; And fast beside him, cheek by jowl, Stuck 'Squire M'Fingal 'gainst the pole, Glued by the tar t' his rear applied, Like barnacle on vessel's side. But though his body lack'd physician, His spirit was in worse condition. He found his fears of whips and ropes By many a drachm outweigh'd his hopes. As men in jail without mainprize View everything with other eyes, And all goes wrong in church and state, Seen through perspective of the grate: So now M'Fingal's second-sight Beheld all things in gloomier light; His visual nerve, well purged with tar, Saw all the coming scenes of war. As his prophetic soul grew stronger, He found he could hold in no longer. First from the pole, as fierce he shook, His wig from pitchy durance broke, His mouth unglued, his feathers flutter'd, His tarr'd skirts crack'd, and thus he utter'd. “Ah, Mr Constable, in vain We strive 'gainst wind, and tide, and rain, Behold my doom! this feathery omen Portends what dismal times are coming. Now future scenes, before my eyes, And second-sighted forms arise. I hear a voice, that calls away, And cries, ‘the whigs will win the day.’ My beck'ning genius gives command, And bids me fly the fatal land; Where changing name and constitution, Rebellion turns to revolution, While loyalty, oppress'd, in tears, Stands trembling for its neck and ears. “Go, summon all our brethren, greeting, To muster at our usual meeting; There my prophetic voice shall warn 'em Of all things future that concern 'em, And scenes disclose on which, my friend, Their conduct and their lives depend. There I—but first 't is more of use, From this vile pole to set me loose; Then go, with cautious steps and steady, While I steer home and make all ready. JONATHAN MITCHELL SEWALL WAR AND WASHINGTON. Vain Britons, boast no longer with proud indignity, By land your conquering legions, your matchless strength at sea, Since we, your braver sons, incensed, our swords have girded on, Huzza, huzza, huzza, huzza, for war and Washington! Urged on by North and vengeance, those valiant champions came, Loud bellowing Tea and Treason, and George was all on flame, Yet sacrilegious as it seems, we rebels still live on, And laugh at all their empty puffs,—huzza for Washington! Still deaf to mild entreaties, still blind to England's good, You have for thirty pieces betray'd your country's blood. Like Esop's greedy cur you'll gain a shadow for your bone, Yet find us fearful shades indeed, inspired by Washington. Mysterious! unexampled! incomprehensible! The blundering schemes of Britain, their folly, pride, and zeal. Like lions how ye growl and threat! mere asses have you shown, And ye shall share an ass's fate, and drudge for Washington! Your dark, unfathom'd counsels our weakest heads defeat, Our children rout your armies, our boats destroy your fleet, And to complete the dire disgrace, coop'd up within a town, You live, the scorn of all our host, the slaves of Washington! Great heaven! is this the nation whose thundering arms were hurl'd, Through Europe, Afric, India? whose navy ruled a world? The lustre of your former deeds, whole ages of renown, Lost in a moment, or transferred to us and Washington! Yet think not thirst of glory unsheaths our vengeful swords, To rend your bands asunder, and cast away your cords. 'T is heaven-born freedom fires us all, and strengthens each brave son, From him who humbly guides the plough, to godlike Washington. For this, Oh could our wishes your ancient rage inspire, Your armies should be doubled, in numbers, force, and fire. Then might the glorious conflict prove which best deserved the boon, America, or Albion; a George, or Washington! Fired with the great idea, our fathers' shades would rise; To view the stern contention, the gods desert their skies. And Wolfe; 'mid hosts of heroes, superior bending down, Cry out with eager transport, God save great Washington! Should George, too choice of Britons, to foreign realms apply, And madly arm half Europe, yet still we would defy Turk, Hessian, Jew, and Infidel, or all those powers in one, While Adams guides our senate, our camp great Washington! Should warlike weapons fail us, disdaining slavish fears, To swords we'll beat our ploughshares, our pruninghooks to spears, And rush, all desperate! on our foe, nor breathe till battle won; Then shout, and shout America! and conquering Washington! Proud France should view with terror, and haughty Spain revere, While every warlike nation would court alliance here. And George, his minions trembling round, dismounting from his throne, Pay homage to America, and glorious Washington! FRANCIS HOPKINSON. THE BATTLE OF THE KEGS. This ballad was occasioned by a real incident. Certain machines, in the form of kegs, charged with gunpowder, were sent down the river to annoy the British shipping then at Philadelphia. The danger of these machines being discovered, the British manned the wharves and shipping, and discharged their small arms and cannons at everything they saw floating in the river, during the ebb tide. Gallants attend, and hear a friend, Trill forth harmonious ditty, Strange things I'll tell which late befell In Philadelphia city. 'T was early day, as poets say, Just when the sun was rising, A soldier stood on a log of wood, And saw a thing surprising. As in amaze he stood to gaze, The truth can't be denied, sir, He spied a score of kegs or more Come floating down the tide, sir. A sailor too, in jerkin blue, This strange appearance viewing, First damn'd his eyes, in great surprise, Then said, “Some mischief's brewing. “These kegs, I'm told, the rebels bold, Pack'd up like pickled herring; And they 're come down t' attack the town, In this new way of ferrying.” The soldier flew, the sailor too, And scared almost to death, sir, Wore out their shoes, to spread the news, And ran till out of breath, sir. Now up and down, throughout the town Most frantic scenes were acted; And some ran here, and others there, Like men almost distracted. Some fire cried, which some denied, But said the earth had quaked; And girls and boys, with hideous noise, Ran through the streets half naked. Sir William he, snug as a flea, Lay all this time a snoring, Nor dream'd of harm, as he lay warm, In bed with Mrs L?g. Now in a fright he starts upright, Awaked by such a clatter; He rubs both eyes, and boldly cries, “For God's sake, what's the matter?’ At his bedside he then espied Sir Erskine at command, sir, Upon one foot he had one boot, And the other in his hand, sir. “Arise, arise,” Sir Erskine cries, “The rebels—more 's the pity, Without a boat are all afloat, And ranged before the city. “The motly crew, in vessels new, With Satan for their guide, sir. Pack'd up in bags, or wooden kegs, Come driving down the tide, sir. “Therefore prepare for bloody war,— These kegs must all be routed, Or surely we despised shall be, And British courage doubted.” The royal band now ready stand, All ranged in dread array, sir, With stomach stout to see it out, And make a bloody day, sir. The cannons roar from shore to shore, The small arms make a rattle; Since wars began I'm sure no man E'er saw so strange a battle. The rebel dales, the rebel vales, With rebel trees surrounded; The distant wood, the hills and floods, With rebel echoes sounded. The fish below swam to and fro, Attack'd from every quarter; Why sure, thought they, the devil 's to pay, 'Mongst folks above the water. The kegs, 't is said, though strongly made, Of rebel staves and hoops, sir, Could not oppose their powerful foes, The conquering British troops, sir. From morn to night these men of might Display'd amazing courage; And when the sun was fairly down, Retired to sup their porridge. An hundred men with each a pen, Or more, upon my word, sir. It is most true, would be too few, Their valor, to record, sir. Such feats did they perform that day, Against these wicked kegs, sir, That years to come, if they get home, They'll make their boasts and brags, sir. SONG. Soft ideas love inspiring, Every placid joy unite; Every anxious thought retiring, Fill my bosom with delight. Soft ideas, gently flowing, On your tide, so calm and still; Bear me where sweet zeyphrs blowing, Wave the pines on Borden's Hill. Where the breezes odors bringing, Fill the grove with murmuring sound; Where shrill notes of birds, sweet singing, Echo to the hills around. To the pleasing gloom convey me, Let my Delia too be there; On her gentle bosom lay me, On her bosom soft and fair. Whilst I there, with rapture burning, All my joy in her express, Let her, love for love returning, Me with fond caresses bless. On his little wings descending, Bring the god of soft delight: Hymen too, with torch attending, Must our hands and hearts unite. She the source of all my pleasure Shall my breast with transport fill; Delia is my soul's best treasure, Delia, pride of Borden's Hill. SONG. Come, fair Rosina, come away, Long since stern winter's storms have ceased! See! Nature, in her best array, Invites us to her rural feast: The season shall her treasure spread, Her mellow fruits and harvests brown, Her flowers their richest odors shed, And every breeze pour fragrance down. At noon we'll seek the wild wood's shade, And o'er the pathless verdure rove; Or, near a mossy fountain laid, Attend the music of the grove. At eve, the sloping mead invites 'Midst lowing herds and flocks to stray; Each hour shall furnish new delights, And love and joy shall crown the day. SONG. O'er the hills far away, at the birth of the morn, I hear the full tone of the sweet sounding horn; The sportsmen with shoutings all hail the new day, And swift run the hounds o'er the hills far away. Across the deep valley their course they pursue, And rush through the thickets yet silver'd with dew; Nor hedges nor ditches their speed can delay— Still sounds the sweet horn o'er the hills far away. SONG. My generous heart disdains The slave of love to be, I scorn his servile chains, And boast my liberty. This whining And pining And wasting with care, Are not to my taste, be she ever so fair. Shall a girl's capricious frown Sink my noble spirits down? Shall a face of white and red Make me droop my silly head? Shall I set me down and sigh For an eyebrow or an eye? For a braided lock of hair, Curse my fortune and despair? My generous heart disdains, &amp;c. Still uncertain is tomorrow, Not quite certain is today— Shall I waste my time in sorrow? Shall I languish life away? All because a cruel maid Hath not love with love repaid. My generous heart disdains, &amp;c. LINES ON THE QUARREL AMONG THE STUDENTS IN ANATOMY IN PHILADELPHIA. Friends and associates! lend a patient ear, Suspend intestine broils and reason hear. Ye followers of ? your wrath forbear— Ye sons of ? your invectives spare; The fierce dissension your high minds pursue Is sport for others—ruinous to you. Surely some fatal influenza reigns, Some epidemic rabies turns your brains; Is this a time for brethren to engage In public contest and in party rage? Fell discord triumphs in your doubtful strife, And, smiling, whets her anatomic knife; Prepared to cut our precious limbs away And leave the bleeding body to decay. Seek ye for foes? alas, my friends, look round, In every street, see numerous foes abound! Methinks I hear them cry, in varied tones, “Give us our father's—brother's—sister's bones.” Methinks I see a mob of sailors rise— “Revenge!—revenge!” they cry, and damn their eyes— “Revenge for comrade Jack, whose flesh they say, You minced to morsels and then threw away.” Methinks I see a black infernal train— The genuine offspring of accursed Cain— Fiercely on you their angry looks are bent, They grin and gibber dangerous discontent, And seem to say—“Is there not meat enough? Ah! massa cannibal, why eat poor Cuff?” Even hostile watchmen stand in strong array, And o'er our heads their threatening staves display: Howl hideous discord through the noon of night, And shake their dreadful lanthorns in our sight. Say, are not these sufficient to engage Your high wrought souls eternal war to wage? Combine your strength these monsters to subdue, No friends of science and sworn foes to you; On these—on these, your wordy vengeance pour, And strive our fading glory to restore. Ah! think how, late, our mutilated rites And midnight orgies, were by sudden frights And loud alarms profaned—the sacrifice, Stretch'd on a board before our eager eyes, All naked lay—even when our chieftain stood Like a high priest, prepared for shedding blood; Prepared, with wonderous skill to cut or slash, The gentle sliver or the deep drawn gash; Prepared to plunge even elbow deep in gore, Nature and nature's secrets to explore— Then a tumultuous cry—a sudden fear— Proclaim'd the foe—the enraged foe is near— In some dark hole the hard-got corse was laid, And we, in wild conclusion, fled dismay'd. Think how, like brethren, we have shared the toil, When in the Potter's field we sought for spoil, Did midnight ghosts and death and horror brave— To delve for science in the dreary grave.— Shall I remind you of that awful night When our compacted band maintained the fight Against an arméd host?—fierce was the fray, And yet we bore our sheeted prize away. Firm on a horse's back the corse was laid, High blowing winds the winding sheet display'd; Swift flew the steed—but still his burthen bore— Fear made him fleet, who ne'er was fleet before; O'er tombs and sunken graves he coursed around, Nor aught respected consecrated ground. Meantime the battle raged—so loud the strife, The dead were almost frighten'd into life— Though not victorious, yet we scorn'd to yield, Retook our prize, and left the doubtful field. In this degenerate age, alas! how few The paths of science with true zeal pursue? Some trifling contest, some delusive joy Too oft the unsteady minds of youth employ. For me—whom Esculapius hath inspired— I boast a soul with love of science fired; By one great object is my heart possess'd— One ruling passion quite absorbs the rest— In this bright point my hopes and fears unite; And one pursuit alone can give delight. To me things are not as to vulgar eyes, I would all nature's works anatomize— This world a living monster seems, to me, Rolling and sporting in the aerial sea; The soil encompasses her rocks and stones As flesh in animals encircles bones. I see vast ocean, like a heart in play, Pant systole and diastole every day, And by unnumbered venous streams supply'd Up her broad river force the arterial tide. The world's great lungs, monsoons and tradewinds show From east to west, from west to east they blow Alternate respiration— The hills are pimples which earth's face defile, And burning Ætna, an eruptive bile: From her vast body perspirations rise, Condense in clouds and float beneath the skies: Thus fancy, faithful servant of the heart, Transforms all nature by her magic art. E'en mighty love, whose power all powers controls; Is not, in me, like love in other souls— Yet I have loved—and Cupid's subtle dart Hath through my pericardium pierced my heart. Brown Cadavera did my soul ensnare, Was all my thought by night and daily care— I long'd to clasp, in her transcendant charms, A living skeleton within my arms. Long, lank, and lean, my Cadavera stood, Like the tall pine, the glory of the wood— Oft times I gazed, with learned skill to trace The sharp edged beauties of her bony face— There rose os frontis prominent and bold, In deep sunk orbits two large eye-balls roll'd, Beneath those eye-balls, two arch'd bones were seen Whereon two flabby cheeks hung loose and lean; Beneath those cheeks, proturberant arose, In form triangular, her lovely nose, Like Egypt's pyramid it seem'd to rise, Scorn earth, and bid defiance to the skies; Thin were her lips, and of a sallow hue, Her open'd mouth exposed her teeth to view; Projecting strong, protuberant and wide Stood incisores—and on either side The canine ranged, with many a beauteous flaw, And last the grinders, to fill up the jaw— All in their alveoli fix'd secure, Articulated by gomphosis sure. Around her mouth, perpetual smiles had made Wrinkles wherein the loves and graces play'd; There, stretch'd and rigid by continual strain, Appear'd the zygomatic muscles plain, And broad montanus o'er her peaked chin Extended to support the heavenly grin. Long were her fingers and her knuckles bare, Much like the claw-foot of a walnut chair. So plain was complex metacarpus shown It might be fairly counted bone by bone. Her slender phalanxes were well defined, And each with each by ginglymus combined. Such were the charms that did my fancy fire, And love—chaste, scientific love inspire. ANN ELIZA BLEECKER. TO MISS TEN EYCK. Dear Kitty, while you rove through sylvan bowers, Inhaling fragrance from salubrious flowers, Or view your blushes mantling in the stream, When Luna gilds it with her amber beam; The brazen voice of war awakes our fears, Impearling every damask cheek with tears The savage, rushing down the echoing vales, Frights the poor hind with ill portending yells; A livid white his consort's cheeks invest; She drops her blooming infant from her breast; She tries to fly, but quick recoiling sees The painted Indian issuing from the trees; Then life suspensive sinks her on the plain, Till dire explosions wake her up again. Oh, horrid sight! her partner is no more; Pale is his corse, or only tinged with gore; Her playful babe is dash'd against the stones, Its scalp torn off, and fractured all its bones. Where are the dimpling smiles it lately wore? Ghastly in agony it smiles no more! Dumb with amaze, and stupefied with grief, The captured wretch must now attend her chief: Reluctantly she quits the scene of blood, When lo! a sudden light illumes the wood; She turns, and sees the rising fires expand, And conflagration roll through half the land; The western flames to orient skies are driven, And change the azure to a sable heaven. Such are our woes, my dear, and be it known Many still suffer what I tell of one: No more Albania's sons in slumber lie, When Cynthia's crescent gleams along the sky; But every street patrole, and through the night Their beamy arms reflect a dreadful light. Excuse, dear girl, for once this plaintive strain; I must conclude, lest I transgress again. TO MR BLEECKER, ON HIS PASSAGE TO NEW YORK. Shall fancy still pursue the expanding sails, Calm Neptune's brow, or raise impelling gales? Or with her Bleecker ply the laboring oar, When pleasing scenes invite him to the shore, There with him through the fading valleys rove, Bless'd in idea with the man I love? Methinks I see the broad majestic sheet Swell to the wind; the flying shores retreat: I see the banks, with varied foliage gay, Inhale the misty sun's reluctant ray: The lofty groves stripp'd of their verdure, rise To the inclemence of autumnal skies. Rough mountains now appear, while pendant woods Hang o'er the gloomy steep and shade the floods; Slow moves the vessel, while each distant sound The cavern'd echoes doubly loud rebound: A placid stream meanders on the steep, Till tumbling from the cliff, divides the frowning deep. Oh tempt not fate on those stupendous rocks, Where never shepherd led his timid flocks; But shagged bears in those wild deserts stray, And wolves, who howl against the lunar ray: There builds the ravenous hawk her lofty nest, And there the soaring eagle takes her rest; The solitary deer recoils to hear The torrent thundering in the midway air. Ah! let me intercede—Ah! spare her breath, Nor aim the tube charged with a leaden death. But now advancing to the opening sea, The wind springs up, the lessening mountains flee; The eastern banks are crown'd with rural seats, And nature's work the hand of art completes. Here Philips' villa, where Pomona joins At once the product of a hundred climes; Here, tinged by Flora, Asian flowers unfold Their burnish'd leaves of vegetable gold. When snows descend, and clouds tumultuously fly Through the blue medium of the crystal sky, Beneath his painted mimic heaven he roves Amidst the glass-encircled citron groves; The grape and luscious fig his taste invite, Hesperian apples glow upon his sight; The sweet auriculas their bells display, And Philips finds in January, May. But on the other side the cliffs arise, Charybdis like, and seem to prop the skies: How oft with admiration have we view'd Those adamantine barriers of the flood? Yet still the vessel cleaves the liquid mead, The prospect dies, the aspiring rocks recede; New objects rush upon the wondering sight, Till Phœbus rolls from heaven his car of light, And Cynthia's silver crescent gilds the night. I hear the melting flute's melodious sound, Which dying zephyrs waft alternate round, The rocks in notes responsive soft complain, And think Amphion strikes his lyre again. Ah! 'tis my Bleecker breathes our mutual loves, And sends the trembling airs through vocal groves. Thus having led you to the happy isle Where waves circumfluent wash the fertile soil, Where Hudson, meeting the Atlantic, roars, The parting lands dismiss him from their shores; Indulge the enthusiast muse her favorite strain Of panegyric, due to Eboracia's plain. There is no land where heaven her blessings pours In such abundance, as upon these shores; With influence benign the planets rise, Pure is the ether, and serene the skies; With annual gold kind Ceres decks the ground, And gushing springs dispense bland health around: No lucid gems are here, or flaming ore, To tempt the hand of avarice and power: But sun-burnt labor, with diurnal toil, Bids treasures rise from the obedient soil, And commerce calls the ships across the main, For gold exchanging her superfluous grain; While concord, liberty, and jocund health Sport with young pleasure 'mid the rural wealth. AN EVENING PROSPECT. Come, my Susan, quit your chamber, Greet the opening bloom of May, Let us up yon hillock clamber, And around the scene survey. See the sun is now descending, And projects his shadows far, And the bee her course is bending Homeward through the humid air. Mark the lizard just before us, Singing her unvaried strain, While the frog abrupt in chorus, Deepens through the marshy plain. From yon grove the woodcock rises, Mark her progress by her notes, High in air her wings she poises, Then like lightning down she shoots. Now the whip-o-will beginning, Clamorous on a pointed rail, Drowns the more melodious singing Of the catbird, thrush, and quail. Pensive Echo, from the mountain, Still repeats the sylvan sounds, And the crocus-border'd fountain With the splendid fly abounds. There the honeysuckle blooming, Reddens the capricious wave; Richer sweets—the air perfuming, Spicy Ceylon never gave. Cast your eyes beyond this meadow, Painted by a hand divine, And observe the ample shadow Of that solemn ridge of pine. Here a trickling rill depending, Glitters through the artless bower; And the silver dew descending, Doubly radiates every flower. While I speak, the sun is vanish'd, All the gilded clouds are fled, Music from the groves is banish'd, Noxious vapors round us spread. Rural toil is now suspended, Sleep invades the peasant's eyes, Each diurnal task is ended, While soft Luna climbs the skies. Queen of rest and meditation, Through thy medium I adore Him—the author of creation, Infinite, and boundless power. 'T is he who fills thy urn with glory, Transcript of immortal light; Lord! my spirit bows before thee, Lost in wonder and delight. PEACE. All hail, vernal Phœbus! all hail, ye soft breezes! Announcing the visit of spring; How green are the meadows! the air how it pleases! How gleefully all the birds sing! Begone, ye rude tempests, nor trouble the ether, Nor let blushing Flora complain, While her pencil was tinging the tulip, bad weather Had blasted the promising gem. From its verdant unfoldings the timid narcissus Now shoots out a diffident bud; Begone ye rude tempests, for sure as it freezes Ye kill this bright child of the wood: And peace gives new charms to the bright beaming season; The groves we now safely explore, Where murdering banditti, the dark sons of treason, Were shelter'd and awed as before. The swain with his oxen proceeds to the valley, Whose seven years sabbath concludes, And blesses kind heaven, that Britain's black ally Is chased to Canadia's deep woods. And Echo no longer is plaintively mourning, But laughs and is jocund as we; And the turtle-eyed nymphs, to their cots all returning, Carve “Washington,” on every tree. I'll wander along by the side of yon fountain, And drop in its current the line, To capture the glittering fish that there wanton; Ah, no! 't is an evil design. Sport on, little fishes, your lives are a treasure Which I can destroy, but not give; Methinks it 's at best a malevolent pleasure To bid a poor being not live. How lucid the water! its soft undulations Are changeably ting'd by the light; It reflects the green banks, and by fair imitations Presents a new heaven to sight. The butterfly skims o'er its surface, all gilded With plumage just dipp'd in rich dies; But yon infant has seized the poor insect, ah! yield it; There, see the freed bird how it flies! But whither am I and my little dog straying? Too far from our cottage we roam; The dews are already exhaled; cease your playing, Come, Daphne, come let us go home. RETURN TO TOMHANICK. Hail, happy shades! though clad with heavy snows, At sight of you with joy my bosom glows; Ye arching pines, that bow with every breeze, Ye poplars, elms, all hail my well known trees! And now my peaceful mansion strikes my eye, And now the tinkling rivulet I spy; My little garden, Flora, hast thou kept, And watch'd my pinks and lilies while I wept? Or has the grubbing swine, by furies led, The enclosure broke, and on my flowrets fed? Ah me! that spot with blooms so lately graced, With storms and driving snows is now defaced; Sharp icicles from every bush depend, And frosts all dazzling o'er the beds extend: Yet soon fair spring shall give another scene, And yellow cowslips gild the level green; My little orchard sprouting at each bough, Fragrant with clustering blossoms deep shall glow: Ah! then 't is sweet the tufted grass to tread, But sweeter slumbering is the balmy shade; The rapid humming bird, with ruby breast, Seeks the parterre with early blue-bells drest, Drinks deep the honeysuckle dew, or drives The laboring bee to her domestic hives: Then shines the lupine bright with morning gems, And sleepy poppies nod upon their stems; The humble violet and the dulcet rose, The stately lily then, and tulip blows. Farewell, my Plutarch! farewell, pen and muse! Nature exults—shall I her call refuse? Apollo fervid glitters in my face, And threatens with his beam each feeble grace: Yet still around the lovely plants I toil, And draw obnoxious herbage from the soil; Or with the lime-twigs little birds surprise, Or angle for the trout of many dyes. But when the vernal breezes pass away, And loftier Phœbus darts a fiercer ray, The spiky corn then rattles all around, And dashing cascades give a pleasing sound; Shrill sings the locust with prolonged note, The cricket chirps familiar in each cot. The village children, rambling o'er yon hill, With berries all their painted baskets fill. They rob the squirrel's little walnut store, And climb the half exhausted tree for more; Or else to fields of maize nocturnal hie, Where hid, the elusive water-melons lie; Sportive, they make incisions in the rind, The riper from the immature to find; Then load their tender shoulders with the prey, And laughing bear the bulky fruit away. MARGARETTA V. FAUGERES. THE HUDSON. Nile's beauteous waves, and Tiber's swelling tide Have been recorded by the hand of Fame, And various floods, which through earth's channels glide, From some enraptured bard have gain'd a name; E'en Thames and Wye have been the poet's theme, And to their charms hath many an harp been strung, Whilst, Oh! hoar genius of old Hudson's stream, Thy mighty river never hath been sung: Say, shall a female string her trembling lyre, And to thy praise devote the adventurous song? Fired with the theme, her genius shall aspire, And the notes sweeten as they float along. Where rough Ontario's restless waters roar, And hoarsely rave around the rocky shore; Where their abode tremendous north-winds make, And reign the tyrants of the surging lake; There, as the shell-crown'd genii of its caves Toward proud Lawrence urged their noisy waves, A form majestic from the flood arose; A coral bandage sparkled o'er his brows, A purple mantle o'er his limbs was spread, And sportive breezes in his dark locks play'd: Toward the east shore his anxious eyes he cast. And from his ruby lips these accents pass'd: “O favor'd land! indulgent nature yields Her choicest sweets to deck thy boundless fields; Where in thy verdant glooms the fleet deer play, And the hale tenants of the desert stray, While the tall evergreens that edge the dale In silent majesty nod to each gale: Thy riches shall no more remain unknown, Thy wide campaign do I pronounce my own; And while the strong arm'd genii of this lake Their tributary streams to Lawrence take, Back from its source my current will I turn, And o'er thy meadows pour my copious urn.” He said, and, waving high his dripping hand; Bade his clear waters roll toward the land. Glad they obey'd, and struggling to the shore, Dash'd on its broken rocks with thundering roar: The rocks in vain oppose their furious course; From each repulse they rise with tenfold force; And gathering all their angry powers again, Gushed o'er the banks, and fled across the plain Soon as the waves had pressed the level mead, Full many a pearly-footed Naiad fair, With hasty steps, her limpid fountain led, To swell the tide, and hail it welcome there: Their busy hands collect a thousand flowers, And scatter them along the grassy shores. There, bending low, the water-lilies bloom, And the blue crocus shed their moist perfume; There the tall velvet scarlet lark-spur laves Her pale green stem in the pellucid waves; There nods the fragile columbine, so fair, And the mild dewy wild-rose scents the air; While round the trunk of some majestic pine The blushing honeysuckle's branches twine: There too Pomona's richest gifts are found, Her golden melons press the fruitful ground; The glossy crimson plums there swell their rinds, And purple grapes dance to autumnal winds; While all beneath the mandrake's fragrant shade The strawberry's delicious sweets are laid. Through many a “blooming wild” and woodland green, The Hudson's sleeping waters winding stray; Now 'mongst the hills its silvery waves are seen, And now through arching willows steal away: Then bursting on the enamor'd sight once more, Gladden some happy peasant's rude retreat; And passing youthful Troy's commercial shore, With the hoarse Mohawk's roaring surges meet. Oh, beauteous Mohawk! 'wildered with thy charms, The chilliest heart sinks into rapturous glows; While the stern warrior, used to loud alarms, Starts at the thunderings of thy dread Cohoes. Now more majestic rolls the ample tide, Tall waving elms its clovery borders shade, And many a stately dome, in ancient pride, And hoary grandeur, there exalts its head. There trace the marks of culture's sunburnt hand, The honeyed buck-wheat's clustering blossoms view, Dripping rich odors, mark the beard-grain bland, The loaded orchard, and the flax field blue. Albania's gothic spires now greet the eye; Time's hand hath wiped their burnish'd tints away, And the rich fanes which sparkled to the sky, 'Reft of their splendors, mourn in cheerless grey. There many an ancient structure tottering stands; Round the damp chambers mouldy vapors creep, And feathery-footed Silence folds her hands, While the pale genii of the mansion sleep. Yet thither Trade's full freighted vessels come; Thither the shepherds mercantile resort: There Architecture late hath raised her dome, And Agriculture's products fill her port. The grassy hill, the quivering poplar grove, The copse of hazle, and the tufted bank, The long green valley, where the white flocks rove, The jutting rock, o'erhung with ivy dank; The tall pines waving on the mountain's brow, Whose lofty spires catch day's last lingering beam; The bending willow weeping o'er the stream, The brook's soft gurglings, and the garden's glow. Low sunk between the Alleganian hills, For many a league the sullen waters glide, And the deep murmur of the crowded tide, With pleasing awe the wondering voyager fills. On the green summit of yon lofty clift A peaceful runnel gurgles clear and slow, Then down the craggy steep-side dashing swift, Tremendous falls in the white surge below. Here spreads a clovery lawn its verdure far, Around it mountains vast their forests rear, And long ere day hath left his burnish'd car, The dews of night have shed their odors there. There hangs a louring rock across the deep; Hoarse roar the waves its broken base around; Through its dark caverns noisy whirlwinds sweep, While Horror startles at the fearful sound. The shivering sails that cut the fluttering breeze, Glide through these winding rocks with airy sweep: Beneath the cooling glooms of waving trees, And sloping pastures speck'd with fleecy sheep. ON A PAINTER. When Laura appear'd, poor Apelles complain'd, That his sight was bedimm'd, and his optics much pain'd; So his pallet and pencil the artist resign'd, Lest the blaze of her beauty should make him quite blind. But when fair Anne enter'd the prospect was changed, The paints and the brushes in order were ranged; The artist resumed his employment again, Forgetful of labor, and blindness, and pain; And the strokes were so lively that all were assured What the brunette had injured the fair one had cured. Let the candid decide which the chaplet should wear, The charms which destroy, or the charms which repair. TIMOTHY DWIGHT. THE DESTRUCTION OF THE PEQUODS. Ah me! while up the long, long vale of time, Reflection wanders towards the eternal vast, How starts the eye, at many a change sublime, Unbosom'd dimly by the ages pass'd! What mausoleums crowd the mournful waste! The tombs of empires fallen! and nations gone! Each, once inscribed, in gold, with “Aye to last,” Sate as a queen; proclaim'd the world her own, And proudly cried, “By me no sorrows shall be known.” Soon fleets the sunbright form, by man adored. Soon fell the head of gold, to time a prey; The arms, the trunk, his cankering tooth devour'd; And whirlwinds blew the iron dust away. Where dwelt imperial Timur?—far astray, Some lonely-musing pilgrim now inquires; And, rack'd by storms, and hastening to decay, Mohammed's mosque foresees its final fires; And Rome's more lordly temple day by day expires. As o'er proud Asian realms the traveller winds, His manly spirit, hush'd by terror, falls; When some deceased town's lost site he finds, Where ruin wild his pondering eye appals; Where silence swims along the moulder'd walls, And broods upon departed grandeur's tomb. Through the lone, hollow aisles sad echo calls, At each low step; deep sighs the breathing gloom, And weeping fields, around, bewail their Empress's doom. Where o'er an hundred realms, the throne uprose, The screech-owl nests, the panther builds his home; Sleep the dull newts, the lazy adders doze, Where pomp and luxury danced the golden room. Low lies in dust the sky-resembled dome; Tall grass around the broken column waves; And brambles climb, and lonely thistles bloom: The moulder'd arch the weedy streamlet laves, And low resound beneath, unnumber'd sunken graves. Soon fleets the sun-bright form, by man adored; And soon man's demon chiefs from memory fade. In musty volume, now must be explored, Where dwelt imperial nations, long decay'd. The brightest meteors angry clouds invade; And where the wonders glitter'd, none explain. Where Carthage, with proud hand, the trident sway'd, Now mud-wall'd cots sit sullen on the plain, And wandering, fierce, and wild, sequester'd Arabs reign. In thee, O Albion! queen of nations, live Whatever splendors earth's wide realms have known; In thee proud Persia sees her pomp revive; And Greece her arts; and Rome her lordly throne: By every wind, thy Tyrian fleets are blown; Supreme, on fame's dread roll, thy heroes stand; All ocean's realms thy naval sceptre own; Of bards, of sages, how august thy band! And one rich Eden blooms around thy garden'd land. But O how vast thy crimes! through heaven's great year, When few centurial suns have traced their way; When southern Europe, worn by feuds severe; Weak, doting, fallen, has bow'd to Russian sway; And setting glory beam'd her farewell ray; To waste, perchance, thy brilliant fields shall turn; In dust, thy temples, towers, and towns decay; The forest howl, where London's turrets burn; And all thy garlands deck thy sad, funereal urn. Some land, scarce glimmering in the light of fame, Sceptred with arts, and arms (if I divine) Some unknown wild, some shore without a name, In all thy pomp, shall then majestic shine. As silver-headed Time's slow years decline, Not ruins only meet the inquiring eye: Where round yon mouldering oak vain brambles twine, The filial stem, already towering high, Ere long shall stretch his arms, and nod in yonder sky. Where late resounded the wild woodland roar, Now heaves the palace, now the temple smiles; Where frown'd the rude rock, and the desert shore, Now pleasure sports, and business want beguiles, And commerce wings her flight to thousand isles; Culture walks forth; gay laugh the loaded fields; And jocund labor plays his harmless wiles; Glad science brightens; art her mansion builds; And peace uplifts her wand, and heaven his blessing yields. O'er these sweet fields, so lovely now, and gay, Where modest nature finds each want supplied, Where home-born happiness delights to play, And counts her little flock, with household pride, Long frown'd, from age to age, a forest wide: Here hung the slumbering bat; the serpent dire Nested his brood, and drank the impoison'd tide; Wolves peal'd, the dark drear night, in hideous choir; Nor shrank the unmeasured howl from Sol's terrific fire. No charming cot imbank'd the pebbly stream; No mansion tower'd, nor garden teem'd with good; No lawn expanded to the April beam; Nor mellow harvest hung its bending load; Nor science dawn'd; nor life with beauty glow'd; Nor temple whiten'd, in the enchanting dell; In clusters wild, the sluggish wigwam stood; And, borne in snaky paths the Indian fell Now aim'd the death unseen, now scream'd the tiger-yell. E'en now, perhaps, on human dust I tread, Pondering, with solemn pause, the wrecks of time; Here sleeps, perchance, among the vulgar dead, Some chief, the lofty theme of Indian rhyme, Who loved ambition's cloudy steep to climb, And smiled, death, dangers, rivals, to engage; Who roused his followers' souls to deeds sublime, Kindling to furnace heat vindictive rage, And soar'd Cæsarean heights, the Phœnix of his age. In yon small field, that dimly steals from sight, (From yon small field these meditations grow,) Turning the sluggish soil, from morn to night, The plodding hind, laborious, drives his plough, Nor dreams, a nation sleeps his foot below. There, undisturbed by the roaring wave, Released from war, and far from deadly foe, Lies down, in endless rest, a nation brave, And trains, in tempests born, there find a quiet grave. Oft have I heard the tale, when matron sere Sung to my infant ear the song of wo; Of maiden meek, consumed with pining care, Around whose tomb the wild-rose loved to blow: Or told, with swimming eyes, how, long ago, Remorseless Indians, all in midnight dire, The little, sleeping village, did o'erthrow, Bidding the cruel flames to heaven aspire, And scalp'd the hoary head, and burn'd the babe with fire Then, fancy-fired, her memory wing'd its flight, To long-forgotten wars, and dread alarms, To chiefs obscure, but terrible in fight, Who mock'd each foe, and laugh'd at deadliest harms, Sydneys in zeal, and Washingtons in arms. By instinct tender to the woes of man, My heart bewildering with sweet pity's charms, Through solemn scenes, with nature's step, she ran, And hush'd her audience small, and thus the tale began. “Through verdant banks where Thames's branches glide, Long held the Pequods an extensive sway; Bold, savage, fierce, of arms the glorious pride, And bidding all the circling realms obey. Jealous, they saw the tribes, beyond the sea, Plant in their climes; and towns, and cities, rise; Ascending castles foreign flags display; Mysterious art new scenes of life devise; And steeds insult the plains, and cannon rend the skies.” “The rising clouds the savage chief descried, And, round the forest, bade his heroes arm; To arms the painted warriors proudly hied, And through surrounding nations rung the alarm. The nations heard; but smiled, to see the storm, With ruin fraught, o'er Pequod mountains driven And felt infernal joy the bosom warm, To see their light hang o'er the skirts of even, And other suns arise, to gild a kinder heaven.” “Swift to the Pequod fortress Mason sped, Far in the wildering wood's impervious gloom; A lonely castle, brown with twilight dread; Where oft the embowel'd captive met his doom, And frequent heaved, around the hollow tomb, Scalps hung in rows, and whitening bones were strew'd; Where, round the broiling babe, fresh from the womb, With howls the Powaw fill'd the dark abode, And screams, and midnight prayers, invoked the evil god. “There too, with awful rites, the hoary priest, Without, beside the moss-grown altar, stood, His sable form in magic cincture dress'd, And heap'd the mingled offering to his god, What time, with golden light, calm evening glow'd, The mystic dust, the flower of silver bloom, And spicy herb, his hand in order strew'd; Bright rose the curling flame; and rich perfume On smoky wings upflew, or settled round the tomb. “Then, o'er the circus, danced the maddening throng, As erst the Thyas roam'd dread Nysa round, And struck, to forest notes, the ecstatic song, While slow, beneath them, heav'd the wavy ground. With a low, lingering groan, of dying sound, The woodland rumbled; murmured deep each stream; Shrill sung the leaves; all ether sigh'd profound; Pale tufts of purple topp'd the silver flame, And many color'd forms on evening breezes came. “Thin, twilight forms; attired in changing sheen Of plumes, high tinctured in the western ray: Bending, they peep'd the fleecy folds between, Their wings light rustling in the breath of May. Soft hovering round the fire, in mystic play, They snuff'd the incense, waved in clouds afar, Then, silent, floated toward the setting day; Eve redden'd each fine form, each misty car; And through them faintly gleam'd, at times, the western star. “Then (so tradition sings,) the train behind, In plumy zones of rainbow'd beauty dress'd, Rode the Great Spirit, in the obedient wind, In yellow clouds slow sailing from the west. With dawning smiles, the God his votaries bless'd, And taught where deer retired to ivy dell; What chosen chief with proud command to invest, Where crept the approaching foe, with purpose fell, And where to wind the scout, and war's dark storm dispel. “There on her lover's tomb, in silence laid, While still, and sorrowing, shower'd the moon's pale beam, At times, expectant, slept the widow'd maid, Her soul far wandering on the sylph-wing'd dream. Wafted from evening skies, on sunny stream, Her darling youth with silver pinions shone; With voice of music, tuned to sweetest theme, He told of shell-bright bowers, beyond the sun, Where years of endless joy o'er Indian lovers run. “But now no awful rites, nor potent spell, To silence charm'd the peals of coming war; Or told the dread recesses of the dell, Where glowing Mason led his bands from far: No spirit, buoyant on his airy car, Control'd the whirlwind of invading fight: Deep died in blood, dun evening's falling star Sent sad o'er western hills its parting light, And no returning morn dispersed the long, dark night. “On the drear walls a sudden splendor glow'd, There Mason shone, and there his veterans pour'd. Anew the hero claim'd the fiends of blood, While answering storms of arrows round him shower'd, And the war-scream the ear with anguish gored. Alone, he burst the gate; the forest round Re-echoed death; the peal of onset roar'd, In rush'd the squadrons; earth in blood was drown'd; And gloomy spirits fled, and corses hid the ground. “Not long in dubious fight the host had striven, When, kindled by the musket's potent flame, In clouds, and fire, the castle rose to heaven, And gloom'd the world, with melancholy beam. Then hoarser groans, with deeper anguish, came; And fiercer fight the keen assault repell'd: Nor e'en these ills the savage breast could tame; Like hell's deep caves, the hideous region yell'd, Till death, and sweeping fire, laid waste the hostile field.” THE FARMER'S ADVICE TO THE VILLAGERS. Not long since lived a farmer plain, Intent to gather honest gain, Laborious, prudent, thrifty, neat, Of judgment strong, experience great, In solid homespun clad, and tidy, And with no coxcomb learning giddy, Daily, to hear his maxims sound, The approaching neighbors flock'd around; Daily they saw his counsels prove The source of union, peace, and love, The means of prudence, and of wealth, Of comfort, cheerfulness, and health: And all, who follow'd his advice, Appear'd more prosperous, as more wise. Wearied, at length, with many a call, The sage resolved to summon all: And gathering, on a pleasant Monday, A crowd, not always seen on Sunday, Curious to hear, while hard they press'd him, In friendly terms, he thus address'd 'em. “My friends, you have my kindest wishes; Pray think a neighbor not officious, While thus, to teach you how to live, My very best advice I give. “And first, industrious be your lives; Alike employ'd yourselves, and wives: Your children, join'd in labor gay, With something useful fill each day. Those little times of leisure save, Which most men lose, and all men have; The half days, when a job is done; The whole days, when a storm is on. Few know, without a strict account, To what these little times amount: If wasted, while the same your cost, The sums, you might have earn'd, are lost. “Learn small things never to despise: You little think how fast they rise. A rich reward the mill obtains, Though but two quarts a bushel gains: Still rolling on its steady rounds, The farthings soon are turn'd to pounds. “Nor think a life of toil severe: No life has blessings so sincere. Its meals so luscious, sleep so sweet, Such vigorous limbs, such health complete, A mind so active, brisk, and gay, As his, who toils the livelong day. A life of sloth drags hardly on; Suns set too late, and rise too soon; Youth, manhood, age, all linger slow, To him, who nothing has to do. The drone, a nuisance to the hive, Stays, but can scarce be said to live; And well the bees, those judges wise, Plague, chase, and sting him, till he dies. Lawrence, like him, though saved from hanging, Yet every day deserves a banging. “Let order o'er your time preside, And method all your business guide. Early begin, and end, your toil; Nor let great tasks your hands embroil. One thing at once, be still begun, Contrived, resolved, pursued, and done. Hire not, for what yourselves can do; And send not, when yourselves can go; Nor, till tomorrow's light, delay What might as well be done today. By steady efforts all men thrive, And long by moderate labor live; While eager toil, and anxious care, Health, strength, and peace, and life impair. “What thus your hands with labor earn, To save, be now your next concern. Whate'er to health, or real use, Or true enjoyment, will conduce, Use freely, and with pleasure use; But ne'er the gifts of heaven abuse: I joy to see your treasured stores, Which smiling plenty copious pours; Your cattle sleek, your poultry fine, Your cider in the tumbler shine, Your tables, smoking from the hoard, And children smiling round the board. All rights to use in you conspire; The laborer's worthy of his hire. Ne'er may that hated day arrive, When worse yourselves, or yours, shall live Your dress, your lodging, or your food, Be less abundant, neat, or good; Your dainties all to market go, To feast the epicure, and beau; But ever on your tables stand, Proofs of a free and happy land. “Yet still, with prudence, wear, and taste; Use what you please, but nothing waste: On little, better far to live, Than, poor and pitied, much survive. Like ants, lay something up in store, Against the winter of threescore. Disease may long your strength annoy; Weakness and pain your limbs destroy; On sorrow's bed your households lie; Your debtors fail, your cattle die; Your crops untimely seasons kill, And life be worn with many an ill. “'T is folly in the extreme, to till Extensive fields, and till them ill. The farmer, pleased, may boast aloud His bushels sown, his acres plough'd; And, pleased, indulge the cheering hope, That time will bring a plenteous crop. Shrew'd common-sense sits laughing by, And sees his hopes abortive die; For, when maturing seasons smile, Thin sheaves shall disappoint his toil. Advised, this empty pride expel; Till little, and that little well. Of taxing, fencing, toil, no more, Your ground requires, when rich, than poor; And more one fertile acre yields, Than the huge breadth of barren fields. “When first the market offers well, At once your yearly produce sell. A higher price you wait in vain, And ten times lose, where once you gain. The dog, that at the shadow caught, Miss'd all he had, and all he sought. Less, day by day, your store will grow, Gone, you scarce know or when, or how; Interest will eat, while you delay, And vermin steal your hopes away. In parcels sold, in ways unknown, It melts, and, unobserved, is gone. No solid purpose driblets aid, Spent, and forgot, as soon as paid: The sum, a year's whole earnings yield, Will pay a debt, or buy a field. “Neat be your farms: 't is long confess'd, The neatest farmers are the best. Each bog, and marsh, industrious drain, Nor let vile balks deform the plain; No bushes on your headlands grow, Nor briars a sloven's culture show. Neat be your barns; your houses neat; Your doors be clean; your court-yards sweet; No moss the sheltering roof inshroud; No wooden panes the window cloud; No filthy kennel foully flow; Nor weeds with rankling poison grow: But shades expand, and fruit-trees bloom, And flowering shrubs exhale perfume. With pales your garden circle round; Defend, enrich, and clean the ground: Prize high this pleasing, useful rood, And fill with vegetable good. “With punctual hand your taxes pay, Nor put far off the evil day. How soon to an enormous size, Taxes, succeeding taxes, rise! How easy, one by one, discharged! How hardly, in the mass enlarged! How humbling the intrusive dun! How fast, how far, the expenses run! Fees, advertisements, travel, cost, And that sad end of all, the post! This gulf of swift perdition flee, And live, from duns and bailiffs free. “In merchants' books, from year to year, Be cautious how your names appear. How fast their little items count! How great, beyond your hopes, the amount! When shelves, o'er shelves, inviting stand, And wares allure, on either hand; While round you turn enchanted eyes, And feel a thousand wants arise, (Ye young, ye fair, these counsels true Are penn'd for all, but most for you,) Ere fancy lead your hearts astray, Think of the means you have to pay; What wants are nature's; fancy's what; What will yield real good, when bought; What certain, future means you find, To cancel contracts, left behind; What means to make the first of May To you and yours a welcome day. “To you, let each returning spring That day of certain reckoning bring; All debts to cancel, books t' adjust, And check the wild career of trust. From frequent reckonings friendship grows, And peace, and sweet communion, flows. “With steady hand your household sway, And use them always to obey. Always their worthy acts commend; Always against their faults contend; The mind inform; the conscience move; And blame, with tenderness, and love. When round they flock, and smile, and tell Their lambkin sport, and infant weal, Nor foolish laugh, nor fret, nor frown; But all their little interests own; Like them, those trifles serious deem, And daily witness your esteem: Yourselves their best friends always prove, For filial duty springs from love. Teach them, with confidence t' impart, Each secret purpose of the heart: Thrice happy parents, children bless'd, Of mutual confidence possess'd! Such parents shall their children see From vice, and shame, and anguish, free. “How blest this heaven-distinguish'd land! Where schools in every hamlet stand; Far spread the beams of learning bright, And every child enjoys the light. At school, beneath a faithful guide, In teaching skill'd, of morals tried, And pleased the early mind to charm To every good, from every harm, Learn they to read, to write, to spell, And cast accompts, and learn them well: For, on this microscopic plan, Is form'd the wise and useful man. Let him a taste for books inspire; While you, to nurse the young desire, A social library procure, And open knowledge to the poor. This useful taste imbibed, your eyes Shall see a thousand blessings rise. From haunts and comrades vile secure, Where gilded baits to vice allure, No more your sons abroad shall roam, But pleased, their evenings spend at home; Allurements more engaging find, And feast, with pure delight, the mind. The realms of earth their thoughts shall scan, And learn the works and ways of man; See, from the savage, to the sage, How nations ripen, age by age; How states, and men, by virtue rise; How both to ruin sink, by vice; How through the world's great prison-bounds, While one wide clank of chains resounds, Men slaves, while angels weep to see, Some wise, and brave, and bless'd, are free. Through moral scenes shall stretch their sight; Discern the bounds of wrong and right; That loathe; this love; and, pleased, pursue Whate'er from man to man is due; And, from the page of heaven derive The motives, and the means, to live. “In this new world, life's changing round In three descents, is often found. The first, firm, busy, plodding, poor, Earns, saves, and daily swells, his store: By farthings first, and pence, it grows; In shillings next, and pounds, it flows; Then spread his widening farms, abroad; His forests wave; his harvests nod; Fattening, his numerous cattle play, And debtors dread his reckoning day. Ambitious then t' adorn with knowledge His son, he places him at college; And sends, in smart attire, and neat, To travel, through each neighboring state; Builds him a handsome house, or buys, Sees him a gentleman, and dies. “The second, born to wealth, and ease, And taught to think, converse, and please, Ambitious, with his lady-wife, Aims at a higher walk of life. Yet, in those wholesome habits train'd, By which his wealth and weight were gain'd, Bids care in hand with pleasure go, And blends economy with show. His houses, fences, garden, dress, The neat and thrifty man confess. Improved, but with improvement plain, Intent on office, as on gain, Exploring, useful sweets to spy, To public life he turns his eye. A townsman first; a justice soon; A member of the house anon; Perhaps to board, or bench, invited, He sees the state, and subjects, righted; And, raptured with politic life, Consigns his children to his wife. Of household cares amid the round, For her, too hard the task is found. At first she struggles, and contends; Then doubts, desponds, laments, and bends; Her sons pursue the sad defeat, And shout their victory complete; Rejoicing, see their father roam, And riot, rake, and reign, at home. Too late he sees, and sees to mourn, His race of every hope forlorn, Abroad, for comfort, turns his eyes, Bewails his dire mistakes, and dies. “His heir, train'd only to enjoy, Untaught, his mind or hands t' employ, Conscious of wealth enough for life, With business, care, and worth, at strife, By prudence, conscience, unrestrain'd, And none, but pleasure's habits, gain'd, Whirls on the wild career of sense, Nor danger marks, nor heeds expense. Soon ended is the giddy round; And soon the fatal goal is found. His lands, secured for borrow'd gold, His houses, horses, herds, are sold. And now, no more for wealth respected, He sinks, by all his friends neglected; Friends, who, before, his vices flatter'd, And lived upon the loaves he scatter'd. Unacted every worthy part, And pining with a broken heart, To dirtiest company he flies, He gambles, turns a sot, and dies. His children, born to fairer doom, In rags, pursue him to the tomb. “Apprenticed then to masters stern, Some real good the orphans learn; Are bred to toil, and hardy fare, And grow to usefulness, and care; And, following their great-grandsire's plan, Each slow becomes a useful man. “But should contentions rise, and grudges, Which call for arbitrating judges, Still shun the law, that gulf of woe, Whose waves without a bottom flow; That gulf, by storms for ever toss'd, Where all, that 's once afloat, is lost; Where friends, embark'd, are friends no more, And neither finds a peaceful shore: While thousand wrecks, as warnings, lie, The victims of an angry sky. “Each cause let mutual friends decide, With common-sense alone to guide: If right, in silent peace be glad; If wrong, be neither sour, nor sad: As oft you'll find full justice done, As when through twenty terms you 've run; And when, in travel, fees, and cost, Far more than can be won, is lost. “Learn, this conclusion whence I draw. Mark what estates are spent in law! See men litigious, business fly, And loungers live, and beggars die! What anger, hatred, malice fell, And fierce revenge their bosoms swell! What frauds, subornings, tamperings rise! What slanders foul! what shameful lies! What perjuries, blackening many a tongue! And what immensity of wrong! Where peace and kindness dwelt before, See peace and kindness dwell no more! Ills to good offices succeed, And neighbors bid each other bleed! “Esop, the merry Phrygian sage, Worth half the wise men of his age, Has left to litigants a story, Which, with your leave, I'll set before you. “‘The bear and lion on the lawn, Once found the carcase of a fawn. Both claim'd the dainty; neither gave it; But each swore roundly he would have it. They growl'd; they fought; but fought in vain: For neither could the prize obtain; And, while to breathe they both retreated, The lawyer fox came in, and ate it.’” Thus spoke the sage. The crowd around, Applauding, heard the grateful sound; Each, deeply musing, homeward went, T' amend his future life intent; And, pondering past delays, with sorrow, Resolved he would begin tomorrow. COLUMBIA. Columbia, Columbia, to glory arise, The queen of the world, and the child of the skies! Thy genius commands thee; with rapture behold, While ages on ages thy splendors unfold. Thy reign is the last, and the noblest of time, Most fruitful thy soil, most inviting thy clime; Let the crimes of the east ne'er encrimson thy name, Be freedom, and science, and virtue thy fame. To conquest and slaughter let Europe aspire; Whelm nations in blood, and wrap cities in fire; Thy heroes the rights of mankind shall defend, And triumph pursue them, and glory attend. A world is thy realm: for a world be thy laws, Enlarged as thine empire, and just as thy cause; On freedom's broad basis, that empire shall rise, Extend with the main, and dissolve with the skies. Fair Science her gates to thy sons shall unbar, And the east see thy morn hide the beams of her star. New bards, and new sages, unrivall'd shall soar To fame unextinguish'd, when time is no more; To thee, the last refuge of virtue designed, Shall fly from all nations the best of mankind; Here, grateful to heaven, with transport shall bring Their incense, more fragrant than odors of spring. Nor less shall thy fair ones to glory ascend, And genius and beauty in harmony blend; The graces of form shall awake pure desire, And the charms of the soul ever cherish the fire; Their sweetness unmingled, their manners refined, And virtue's bright image, instamp'd on the mind, With peace, and soft rapture, shall teach life to glow, And light up a smile in the aspect of woe. Thy fleets to all regions thy power shall display, The nations admire, and the ocean obey; Each shore to thy glory its tribute unfold, And the east and the south yield their spices and gold. As the day-spring unbounded, thy splendor shall flow, And earth's little kingdoms before thee shall bow: While the ensigns of union, in triumph unfurl'd, Hush the tumult of war, and give peace to the world. Thus, as down a lone valley, with cedars o'erspread, From war's dread confusion I pensively stray'd— The gloom from the face of fair heaven retired; The winds ceased to murmur; the thunders expired; Perfumes, as of Eden, flow'd sweetly along, And a voice, as of angels, enchantingly sung: “Columbia, Columbia, to glory arise, The queen of the world and the child of the skies.” THE CRITICS. A FABLE. 'T is said of every dog that's found, Of mongrel, spaniel, cur, and hound, That each sustains a doggish mind, And hates the new, sublime, refined. 'T is hence the wretches bay the moon, In beauty throned at highest noon, Hence every nobler brute they bite, And hunt the stranger-dog with spite; And hence, the nose's dictates parrying, They fly from meat to feed on carrion. 'T is also said, the currish soul The critic race possesses whole; As near they come, in thoughts and natures, As two legg'd can, to four legg'd creatures; Alike the things they love and blame, Their voice, and language, much the same. The muse this subject made her theme, And told me in a morning dream. Such dreams you sages may decry; But muses know they never lie. Then hear, from me, in grave narration, Of these strange facts, the strange occasion. In Greece Cynethe's village lay, Well known to all, who went that way, For dogs of every kindred famed, And from true doggish manners named. One morn, a greyhound pass'd the street; At once the foul-mouth'd conclave met, Huddling around the stranger ran, And thus their smart review began. “What tramper,” with a grinning sneer Bark'd out the clumsy cur, “is here? No native of the town, I see; Some foreign whelp of base degree. I'd show, but that the record 's torn, We true Welsh curs are better born. His coat is smooth; but longer hair Would more become a dog by far. His slender ear, how straight and sloping! While ours is much improved by cropping.” “Right,” cried the blood-hound, “that straight ear Seems made for nothing but to hear; 'T is long agreed, through all the town, That handsome ears, like mine, hang down; And though his body's gaunt and round, 'T is no true rawboned gaunt of hound. How high his nose the creature carries! As if on bugs, and flies, his fare is; I'll teach this strutting stupid log, To smell 's the business of a dog.” “Baugh-waugh!” the shaggy spaniel cried, “What wretched covering on his hide! I wonder where he lives in winter; His straight, sleek legs too, out of joint are; I hope the vagrant will not dare His fledging with my fleece compare. He never plunged in pond or river, To search for wounded duck and diver; By kicks would soon be set a skipping, Nor take one half so well a whipping.” “Rat me,” the lap-dog yelp'd, “through nature, Was ever seen so coarse a creature? I hope no lady's sad mishap E'er led the booby to her lap; He 'd fright Primrilla into fits, And rob Fooleria of her wits; A mere barbarian, Indian whelp! How clownish, countryish, sounds his yelp! He never tasted bread and butter, Nor play'd the petty squirm and flutter; Nor e'er, like me, has learn'd to fatten, On kisses sweet, and softest patting.” “Some parson's dog, I vow,” whined puppy; “His rusty coat how sun-burnt! stop ye!” The beagle call'd him to the wood, The bull-dog bellowed, “Zounds! and blood!” The wolf-dog and the mastiff were, The muse says, an exception here; Superior both to such foul play, They wish'd the stranger well away. From spleen the strictures rose to fury, “Villain,” growl'd one, “I can't endure you.” “Let 's seize the truant,” snarl'd another, Encored by every foul-mouth'd brother. “'T is done,” bark'd all, “we'll mob the creature, And sacrifice him to ill nature.” The greyhound, who despised their breath, Still thought it best to shun their teeth. Easy he wing'd his rapid flight, And left the scoundrels out of sight. Good Juno, by the ancients holden The genuine notre-dame of scolding, Sat pleased, because there 'd such a fuss been, And in the hound's place wish'd her husband; For here, even pleasure bade her own, Her ladyship was once outdone. “Hail, dogs,” she cried, “of every kind! Retain ye still this snarling mind, Hate all that 's good, and fair, and new, And I'll a goddess be to you. “Nor this the only good you prove; Learn what the fruits of Juno's love. Your souls, from forms, that creep all four on, I'll raise, by system Pythagorean, To animate the human frame, And gain my favorite tribe a name. Be ye henceforth (so I ordain) Critics, the genuine curs of men. To snarl be still your highest bliss, And all your criticism like this. Whate'er is great or just in nature, Of graceful form, or lovely feature; Whate'er adorns the enobled mind, Sublime, inventive, and refined; With spleen, and spite, for ever blame, And load with every dirty name. All things of noblest kind and use, To your own standard vile reduce, And all in wild confusion blend, Nor heed the subject, scope, or end. But chief, when modest young beginners, 'Gainst critic laws, by nature sinners, Peep out in verse, and dare to run, Through towns and villages your own, Hunt them, as when yon stranger dog Set all your growling crew agog; Till stunn'd, and scared, they hide from view, And leave the country clear for you.” This said, the goddess kind caressing, Gave every cur a double blessing. Each doggish mind, though grown no bigger, Henceforth assumed the human figure: The body walk'd on two, the mind To four still chose to be confined; Still creeps on earth, still scents out foes, Is still led onward by the nose; Hates all the good, it used to hate, The lofty, beauteous, new, and great; The stranger hunts with spite quintessent, And snarls, from that day to the present. THE WORSHIP OF THE GIBEONITES. Now o'er the hills red streams began to burn, And bursting splendors usher'd in the morn; With living dyes the flowers all beauteous glow'd, O'er the glad fields etherial odors flow'd; The forest echoed with a boundless song, And rising breezes pour'd the strains along. Adorn'd with green before the palace lay A spacious square, and smiled upon the day. Here, ere the dawn the kindling skies illumed, Or opening flowers the fragrant gales perfumed, Of every age, a vast, assembled train Pour'd from the lofty domes, and fill'd the plain. High in the midst two sacred altars shone, Adorn'd with honors to their God, the Sun. This, deck'd with art, and bright in royal pride, With sable gore the quivering victim dyed: On that, gay flowers in rich profusion lay, And gales of Eden bore their sweets away. Here, white with age, in snowy vesture dress'd, Aradon stood, their monarch, and their priest; Red in his hand a torch refulgent shone, And his fix'd countenance watch'd the rising sun. When first the flaming orb, with glorious rays, Roll'd o'er the hills, and pour'd a boundless blaze; Charmed at the sight, the monarch stretch'd his hand, And touch'd the tributes with the sacred brand; Through freshen'd air perfumes began to rise, And curling volumes mounted to the skies. Thrice to the earth the raptured suppliants bow'd, Then struck the lyre, and hymn'd the rising god. “O thou, whose bursting beams in glory rise, And sail, and brighten, through unbounded skies! The world's great Parent! heaven's exalted King! Sole source of good! and life's eternal Spring! All hail, while cloth'd in beauty's endless ray, Thy face unclouded gives the new-born day! “Above all scenes is placed thy heavenly throne; Ere time began, thy spotless splendor shone; Sublime from east to west thy chariot rolls, Cheers the wide earth, and warms the distant poles; Commands the vegetable race to grow, The fruit to redden, and the flower to blow. This world was born to change: the hand of Time Makes, and unmakes the scenes of every clime. The insect millions scarce the morn survive; One transient day the flowery nations live; A few short years complete the human doom; Then pale death summons to the narrow tomb. Lash'd by the flood, the hard rocks wear away; Worn by the storm, the lessening hills decay; Unchanged alone is thine exalted flame, From endless years to endless years the same; Thy splendors with immortal beauty shine, Roll round the eternal heavens, and speak thy name divine “When thy bright throne, beyond old ocean's bound, Through nether skies pursues its destined round, Lost in the ascending darkness, beauty fades; Through the blank field, and through the woodland, spreads A melancholy silence. O'er the plain Dread lions roam, and savage terrors reign. “And when sad autumn sees thy face retire, And happier regions hail thy orient fire, High in the storm imperious winter flies, And desolation saddens all the skies. But when once more thy beam the north ascends, Thy light invigorates, and thy warmth extends; The fields rejoice, the groves with transport ring, And boundless nature hails the sky-born spring. “Nor even in winter's gloom, or night's sad reign, Darts the warm influence of thy beams in vain. “Beyond the main some fairer region lies, Some brighter isles beneath the southern skies, Where crimson war ne'er bade the clarion roar, Nor sanguine billows dyed the vernal shore: No thundering storm the day's bright face conceals, No summer scorches, and no frost congeals; No sickness wastes, no grief provokes the tear, Nor tainted vapors blast the clement year. Round the glad day-star endless beauties burn, And crowned with rainbows, opes the imperial morn; A clear unbounded light the skies display, And purple lustre leads the the changing day. O'er conscious shades, and bowers of soft repose, Young breezes spring, and balmy fragrance blows, The fields all wanton in serenest beams, Wake fairer flowers, and roll diviner streams; Through the long vales aerial music roves, And nobler fruitage dyes the bending groves. “Through spotless nations as the realm refined, Thy influence there sublimes the immortal mind; Its active pinions swift through nature roam, Lose the low world, and claim a nobler home. Their limbs, of endless life, with glory crown'd, New youth improves, and growing charms surround: On the bless'd shore thy splendors love to shine, And raise thy sons each hour, to raptures more divine.” Thus ceased the sound: the harp's melodious strain Join'd the glad hymn, and charm'd the listening train; A sparkling joy each speaking face display'd, While light expanding lessen'd every shade. BATTLE BEFORE THE WALLS OF AI. Now near the burning domes, the squadrons stood, Their breasts impatient for the scenes of blood: On every face a deathlike glimmer sate, The unbless'd harbinger of instant fate. High through the gloom, in pale and dreadful spires, Rose the long terrors of the dark red fires; Torches, and torrent sparks, by whirlwinds driven, Stream'd through the smoke, and fired the clouded heaven. As oft tall turrets sunk with rushing sound, Broad flames burst forth, and swept the etherial round, The bright expansion lightened all the scene, And deeper shadows lengthen'd o'er the green. Loud through the walls that cast a golden gleam, Crown'd with tall pyramids of bending flame, As thunders rumble down the darkening vales, Roll'd the deep solemn voice of rushing gales: The bands admiring gazed the wondrous sight, And expectation trembled for the fight. At once the sounding clarion breath'd alarms; Wide from the forest burst the flash of arms; Thick gleam'd the helms; and o'er astonish'd fields, Like thousand meteors, rose the flame-bright shields. In gloomy pomp, to furious combat roll'd Ranks sheath'd in mail, and chiefs in glimmering gold; In floating lustre bounds the dim-seen steed, And cars, unfinish'd, swift to cars succeed; From all the host ascends a dark red glare, Here in full blaze, in distant twinklings there; Slow waves the dreadful light; as round the shore Night's solemn blasts with deep concussion roar, So rush the footsteps of the embattled train, And send an awful murmur o'er the plain. Tall in the opposing van, bold Irad stood, And bade the clarion sound the voice of blood. Loud blew the trumpet on the sweeping gales, Rock'd the deep groves, and echo'd round the vales: A ceaseless murmur all the concave fills, Waves through the quivering camp, and trembles o'er the hills. High in the gloomy blaze the standards flew; The impatient youth his burnish'd falchion drew; Ten thousand swords his eager bands display'd, And crimson'd terrors danced on every blade. With equal rage, the bold, Hazorian train Pour'd a wide deluge o'er the shadowy plain; Loud rose the song of war; loud clanged the shields; Dread shouts of vengeance shook the shuddering fields; With mingled din, shrill, martial music rings, And swift to combat each fierce hero springs. So broad, and dark, a midnight storm ascends, Bursts on the main, and trembling nature rends; The red foam burns, the wat'ry mountains rise, And deep unmeasured thunder heaves the skies; The bark drives lonely; shivering and forlorn, The poor, sad sailors wish the lingering morn: Not with less fury rush'd the vengeful train; Not with less tumult roar'd the embattled plain. Now in the oak's black shade they fought conceal'd; And now they shouted through the open field; The long, pale splendors of the curling flame Cast o'er their polish'd arms a livid gleam; An umber'd lustre floated round their way, And lighted falchions to the fierce affray. Now the swift chariots 'gainst the stubborn oak Dash; the dark earth re-echoes to the shock. From shade to shade the forms tremendous stream, And their arms flash a momentary flame. Mid hollow tombs, as fleets an airy train, Lost in the skies, or fading o'er the plain; So visionary shapes, around the fight, Shoot through the gloom, and vanish from the sight; Through twilight paths the maddening coursers bound, The shrill swords crack, the clashing shields resound. There, lost in grandeur, might the eye behold The dark red glimmering of the steel and gold, The chief, the steed, the nimbly rushing car, And all the horrors of the gloomy war. Here the thick clouds, with purple lustre bright, Spread o'er the long, long host and gradual sunk in night; Here half the world was wrapp'd in rolling fires, And dreadful valleys sunk between the spires. Swift ran black forms across the livid flame, And oaks waved slowly in the trembling beam: Loud rose the mingled noise; with hollow sound, Deep rolling whirlwinds roar, and thundering flames resound. As drives a blast along the midnight heath, Rush'd raging Irad on the scenes of death; High o'er his shoulder gleam'd his brandish'd blade, And scatter'd ruin round the twilight shade. Full on a giant hero's sweeping car He pour'd the tempest of resistless war; His twinkling lance the heathen raised on high, And hurl'd it, fruitless, through the gloomy sky; From the bold youth the maddening coursers wheel, Gash'd by the vengeance of his slaughtering steel: 'Twixt two tall oaks the helpless chief they drew; The shrill car dash'd; the crack'd wheels rattling flew; Crush'd in his arms, to rise he strove in vain, And lay unpitied on the dreary plain. EVENING AFTER A BATTLE. Above tall western hills, the light of day Shot far the splendors of his golden ray; Bright from the storm with tenfold grace he smiled, The tumult softened, and the world grew mild. With pomp transcendent, robed in heavenly dyes, Arch'd the clear rainbow round the orient skies; Its changeless form, its hues of beam divine, —Fair type of truth and beauty's—endless shine Around the expanse, with thousand splendors rare; Gay clouds sail'd wanton through the kindling air; From shade to shade, unnumber'd tinctures blend; Unnumber'd forms of wond'rous light extend: In pride stupendous, glittering walls aspire, Graced with bright domes, and crown'd with towers of fire, On cliffs cliffs burn; o'er mountains mountains roll: A burst of glory spreads from pole to pole: Rapt with the splendor, every songster sings, Tops the high bough, and claps his glistening wings: With new born green, reviving nature blooms, And sweeter fragrance freshening air perfumes. Far south the storm withdrew its troubled reign; Descending twilight dimm'd the dusky plain; Black night arose; her curtains hid the ground: Less roar'd, and less, the thunder's solemn sound; The bended lightning shot a brighter stream, Or wrapp'd all heaven in one wide, mantling flame; By turns, o'er plains, and woods, and mountains, spread Faint, yellow glimmerings, and a deeper shade. From parting clouds, the moon outbreaking shone, And sate, sole empress, on her silver throne; In clear, full beauty, round all nature smiled, And claim'd o'er heaven and earth, dominion mild; With humbler glory, stars her court attend, And bless'd, and union'd, silent lustre blend. PROCESSION OF ISRAELITISH VIRGINS TO MEET THE RETURNING ARMY. The sun declined; besmear'd with dust and blood, Slow o'er the plain the wearied squadrons trod; When fair as Phosphor leads the morning train, Dress'd in new beams, and beauteous from the main; Crown'd with white flowers, that breath'd a rich perfume, And clothed in loveliness of gayest bloom, Rose in soft splendor Caleb's youngest pride, A thousand maidens following at her side. In snow white robes of flowing silk array'd, First of the virgins walk'd the blushing maid; Her long, dark hair loose floated in the wind; Her glowing eyes confess'd the etherial mind; A wreath of olive flourish'd in her hand; A silver lyre obey'd her soft command; With sounds harmonious rang the warbled strings, And thus the maids, and thus Selima sings. “Who comes from Ai, adorn'd with gay attire, Bright as the splendor of the morning fire? Fair as the spring, ascends the lovely form, And dreadful as the blaze that lights the storm! Ye maids, with flowerets strew the conqueror's way, Strike the loud harp, and sing the dreadful day!” To Irad's steps the matchless fair one came, Her breast quick panting, and her cheeks on flame; Her beauteous hand the verdant crown display'd; Graceful he bow'd, and placed it on his head. Slow to her train the trembling fair withdrew, The charm'd youths following with a moveless view. So, wing'd with light, and dress'd in strange array, The mantling glory of the rising day, With sweet complacence, such as angels show To souls unprison'd from this world of woe, Parted soft smiling from our general sire Some bright-eyed virtue, of the heavenly choir, Far in the solar walk, with wondrous flight, The form celestial lessen'd on his sight. LAMENTATION OF SELIMA FOR THE DEATH OF IRAD. Canst thou forget, when, call'd from southern bowers, Love tuned the groves, and spring awaked the flowers, How, loosed from slumbers by the morning ray, O'er balmy plains we bent our frequent way? On thy fond arm, with pleasing gaze, I hung, And heard sweet music murmur o'er thy tongue; Hand lock'd in hand, with gentle ardor press'd, Pour'd soft emotions through the heaving breast, In magic transport heart with heart entwined, And in sweet languors lost the melting mind. 'T was then, thy voice, attuned to wisdom's lay, Show'd fairer worlds, and traced the immortal way; In virtue's pleasing paths my footsteps tried, My sweet companion, and my skilful guide; Through varied knowledge taught my mind to soar, Search hidden truths, and new-found walks explore: While still the tale, by nature learn'd to rove, Slid, unperceived, to scenes of happy love. Till weak, and lost, the faltering converse fell, And eyes disclosed what eyes alone could tell; In rapturous tumult bade the passions roll, And spoke the living language of the soul. With what fond hope, through many a blissful hour, We gave the soul to fancy's pleasing power; Lost in the magic of that sweet employ To build gay scenes, and fashion future joy! We saw mild peace o'er fair Canaan rise, And shower her pleasures from benignant skies. On airy hills our happy mansion rose, Built but for joy, nor room reserved for woes. Round the calm solitude, with ceaseless song, Soft roll'd domestic ecstacy along: Sweet as the sleep of innocence, the day, By raptures number'd, lightly danced away: To love, to bliss, the union'd soul was given, And each, too happy! ask'd no brighter heaven. Yet then, even then, my trembling thoughts would rove, And steal an hour from Irad, and from love, Through dread futurity all anxious roam, And cast a mournful glance on ills to come. “Hope not, fond maid,” some voice prophetic cried— “A life, thus wafted down the unruffled tide: Trust no gay, golden doom, from anguish free, Nor wish the laws of heaven reversed for thee. Survey the peopled world; thy soul shall find Woes, ceaseless woes, ordain'd for poor mankind. Life 's a long solitude, an unknown gloom, Closed by the silence of the dreary tomb. “For soon, ah soon shall fleet thy pleasing dreams; Soon close the eye, that, bright as angel's, beams Grace irresistible. To mouldering clay Shall change the face, that smiles thy griefs away: Soon the sweet music of that voice be o'er, Hope cease to charm, and beauty bloom no more: Strange, darksome wilds, and devious ways be trod, Nor love, nor Irad, steal thy heart from God.” And must the hours in ceaseless anguish roll? Must no soft sunshine cheer my clouded soul? Spring charm around me brightest scenes, in vain? And youth's angelic visions wake to pain? Oh come once more, with fond endearments come; Burst the cold prison of the sullen tomb; Through favorite walks, thy chosen maid attend; Where well known shades for thee their branches bend: Shed the sweet poison from thy speaking eye; And look those raptures, lifeless words deny! Still be the tale rehearsed, that ne'er could tire; But, told each eve, fresh pleasure could inspire: Still hoped those scenes, which love and fancy drew; But, drawn a thousand times, were ever new! Again all bright shall glow the morning beam; Again soft suns dissolve the frozen stream: Spring call young breezes from the southern skies, And, clothed in splendor, flowery millions rise. In vain to thee—no morn's indulgent ray Warms the cold mansion of the slumbering clay. No mild etherial gale, with tepid wing, Shall fan thy locks, or wast approaching spring: Unfelt, unknown, shall breathe the rich perfume, And unheard music wave around thy tomb. A cold, dumb, dead repose invests thee round; Still as a void, ere nature form'd a sound. O'er thy dark region, pierced by no kind ray, Slow roll the long, oblivious hours away. In these wild walks, this solitary round, Where the pale moon-beam lights the glimmering ground, At each sad turn, I view thy spirit come, And glide, half seen, behind a neighboring tomb; With visionary hand, forbid my stay, Look o'er the grave, and beckon me away. DAVID HUMPHREYS. ADDRESS TO THE ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES. Ye martial bands! Columbia's fairest pride! To toils inured, in dangers often tried— Ye gallant youths! whose breasts for glory burn, Each selfish aim and meaner passion spurn: Ye who, unmoved, in the dread hour have stood, And smiled, undaunted, in the field of blood— Who greatly dared, at freedom's rapturous call, With her to triumph, or with her to fall— Now brighter days in prospect swift ascend; Ye sons of fame, the hallow'd theme attend; The past review; the future scenes explore, And heaven's high king with grateful hearts adore! What time proud Albion, thundering o'er the waves, Frown'd on her sons, and bade them turn to slaves— When, lost to honor, virtue, glory, shame, When nought remain'd of Britain but the name— The parent state—a parent now no more— Let loose the hirelings of despotic power, Urged to keen vengeance their relentless ire, And hoped submission from their sword and fire. As when dark clouds, from Andes' towering head, Roll down the skies, and round the horizon spread, With thunders fraught, the blackening tempest sails, And bursts tremendous o'er Peruvian vales: So broke the storm on Concord's fatal plain; There fell our brothers, by fierce ruffians slain— Inglorious deed! to wild despair then driven, We, suppliant, made our great appeal to heaven. Then the shrill trumpet echoed from afar, And sudden blazed the wasting flame of war; From State to State swift flew the dire alarms, And ardent youths, impetuous, rush'd to arms: “To arms” the matrons and the virgins sung, To arms, their sires, their husbands, brothers sprung. No dull delay—where'er the sound was heard, Where the red standards in the air appear'd, Where, through vast realms the cannon swell'd its roar, Between the Acadian and Floridian shore. Now join'd the crowd, from their far distant farms, In rustic guise, and unadorn'd in arms: Not like their foes, in tinsel trappings gay, And burnish'd arms that glitter'd on the day; Who now advanced, where Charlestown reared its height, In martial pomp, and claim'd the awful sight; And proudly deem'd, with one decisive blow, To hurl destruction on the routed foe. Not so—just heaven had fix'd the great decree, And bade the sons of freemen still be free; Bade all their souls with patriot ardor burn, And taught the coward, fear of death to spurn; The threats of danger and of war to brave, To purchase freedom, or a glorious grave. Long raged the contest on the embattled field; Nor those would fly, nor these would tamely yield— Till Warren fell, in all the boast of arms, The pride of genius and unrivall'd charms, His country's hope!—full soon the gloom was spread: Oppress'd with numbers, and their leader dead, Slow from the field the sullen troops retired; Behind, the hostile flame to heaven aspired. The imperious Britons, on the well-fought ground, No cause for joy or wanton triumph found, But saw with grief their dreams of conquest vain, Felt the deep wounds, and mourn'd their veterans slain. Nor less our woes. Now darkness gather'd round; The thunder rumbled, and the tempest frown'd; When lo! to guide us through the storm of war, Beam'd the bright splendor of Virginia's star. O first of heroes, fav'rite of the skies, To what dread toils thy country bade thee rise! “Oh raised by heaven to save the invaded state!” (So spake the sage long since thy future fate,) 'T was thine to change the sweetest scenes of life For public cares—to guide the embattled strife; Unnumber'd ills of every kind to dare, The winter's blast, the summer's sultry air, The lurking dagger, and the turbid storms Of wasting war, with death in all his forms. Nor aught could daunt. Unspeakably serene, Thy conscious soul smiled o'er the dreadful scene. The foe then trembled at the well-known name; And raptured thousands to his standard came. His martial skill our rising armies form'd; His patriot zeal their generous bosoms warm'd: His voice inspired, his godlike presence led, The Britons saw, and from his presence fled. Soon reinforced from Albion's crowded shore, New legions came, new plains were drenched in gore; And scarce Columbia's arm the fight sustains, While her best blood gush'd from a thousand veins. Then thine, O Brown! that purpled wide the ground, Pursued the knife through many a ghastly wound. Ah hapless friend! permit the tender tear To flow e'en now, for none flowed on thy bier, Where cold and mangled, under northern skies, To famish'd wolves a prey thy body lies; Which erst so fair and tall in youthful grace, Strength in thy nerves, and beauty in thy face, Stood like a tower, till struck by the swift ball; Then what avail'd (to ward the untimely fall) The force of limbs, the mind so well inform'd, The taste refined, the breast with friendship warm'd, (That friendship which our earliest years begun) Or what the laurels that thy sword had won, When the dark bands from thee, expiring, tore Thy long hair mingled with the spouting gore? Nor less, brave Scammel, frown'd thine angry fate, (May deathless shame that British deed await!) On York's famed field, amid the first alarms, Ere yet fair victory crown'd the allied arms, Fell chance betray'd thee to the hostile band, The hapless victim of the assassin hand! Lo! while I tell the execrable deed, Fresh in his side the dark wound seems to bleed; The small red current still for vengeance cries, And asks, “Why sleeps the thunder in the skies?” On him, ye heavens, let all your vengeance fall, On the curst wretch who wing'd the insidious ball. But thou, blest shade, be sooth'd! be this thy praise, Ripe were thy virtues, though too few thy days! Be this thy fame, through life of all approved, To die lamented, honor'd, and beloved. And see, far south, where yonder hearse appears, An army mourning, and a land in tears! There Laurens, passing to an early tomb, Looks like a flower, just withering in its bloom. Thy father's pride, the glory of our host! Thy country's sorrow, late thy country's boast! O Laurens! generous youth! twice hadst thou bled; Could not the ball with devious aim have sped? And must thy friends, now peace appears so near, Weep the third stroke that cuts a life so dear; That blots the prospect of our rising morn, And leaves thy country, as thy sire, forlorn? Companions loved! long as the life-blood flows, Or vital warmth in this fond bosom glows, While there I cherish your remembrance dear, Oft will I drop the tributary tear. But what avails to trace the fate of war Through fields of blood, and paint each glorious scar? Why should the strain your former woes recall, The tears that wept a friend or brother's fall, When by your side first in the adventurous strife, He dauntless rush'd, too prodigal of life? Enough of merit has each honor'd name, To shine, untarnish'd, on the rolls of fame; To stand the example of each distant age, And add new lustre to the historic page: For soon their deeds, illustrious, shall be shown In breathing bronze, or animated stone, Or where the canvass, starting into life, Revives the glories of the crimson strife. Ye sons of genius, who the pencil hold, Whose master strokes, beyond description bold, Of other years and climes the history trace, Can ye for this neglect your kindred race? Columbia calls—her parent voice demands More grateful offerings from your filial hands. And soon some bard shall tempt the untried themes, Sing how we dared, in fortune's worst extremes; What cruel wrongs the indignant patriot bore, What various ills your feeling bosoms tore, What boding terrors gloom'd the threat'ning hour, When British legions, arm'd with death-like power, Bade desolation mark their crimson'd way, And lured the savage to his destined prey; When fierce Germania her battalions pour'd, And rapine's sons, with wasting fire and sword, Spread death around: where'er your eyes ye turn'd, Fled were the peasants, and the village burn'd. How did your hearts for others' sufferings melt! What torturing pangs your bleeding country felt! What! when you fled before superior force, Each succor lost, and perish'd each resource! When nature, fainting from the want of food, On the white snow your steps were mark'd in blood! When through your tatter'd garbs you met the wind, Despair before, and ruin frown'd behind! When nought was seen around, but prospects drear, The insulting foe hung dreadful on your rear, And boastful ween'd, that day to close the scene, And quench your name, as though it ne'er had been. Why, Britian, raged thy insolence and scorn? Why burst thy vengeance on the wretch forlorn? The cheerless captive to slow death consign'd, Chill'd with keen frost, in prison glooms confined; Of hope bereft, by thy vile minions curst, With hunger famish'd, and consumed with thirst, Without one friend—when death's last horror stung, Roll'd the wild eye, and gnaw'd the anguish'd tongue. Why, Britain, in thy arrogance and pride, Didst thou heaven's violated laws deride, Mock human misery with contemptuous sneers, And fill thy cup of guilt with orphan's tears? The widow's wailing, and the wretch's groan, Rise in remembrance to the eternal throne, While the red flame, through the broad concave driven, Calls down the vengeance of insulted heaven. And didst thou think, by cruelty refined, To damp the ardor of the heaven-born mind, With haughty threats to force the daring train To bow, unnerved, in slavery's galling chain; Make countless freemen—then no longer free, Shrink at thy frown, and bend the servile knee? And couldst thou dream? then wake, dissolve thy charms, Roused by their wrongs, see desperate hosts in arms! No fear dismays, nor danger's voice appals, While kindred blood for sacred vengeance calls: Their swords shall triumph o'er thy vaunted force, And curb the conqueror in his headlong course. What spoils of war, thy sons, Columbia, claim'd! What trophies rose, where thy red ensigns flamed! Where the great chief, o'er Delaware's icy wave, Led the small band, in dangers doubly brave; On high designs, and ere the dawning hour, Germania's veterans own'd the victor's power; Or on the muse's plain, where round thy tomb, O gallant Mercer! deathless laurels bloom; Or where, anon, in northern fields renown'd, The tide of slaughter stain'd the sanguine ground; When the bold freemen, gathering from afar, Foil'd the proud foe, and crush'd the savage war: On that brave band their country's plaudit waits, And consecrates to fame the name of Gates. Nor less the valor of the impetuous shock, Which seized the glorious prize on Hudson's rock, Where Wayne, e'en while he felt the whizzing ball, Pluck'd the proud standard from the vanquish'd wall. Now turn your eyes, where southern realms are seen, From ruin rescued by the immortal Greene: See toils of death, where many a hero bleeds, Till rapid victory to defeat succeeds. On numerous plains, whose streams, unknown to song, Till this great era, roll'd obscure along, Their names shall now, to fame familiar grown, Outlast the pile of monumental stone. Or see on fair Virginia's strand arise, The column pointing to the favoring skies, Inscribed with deeds the federate arms have done, And graved with trophies from Britannia won: Here stand the conquering bands: the vanquish'd throng Through the long lines in silence move along: The stars and lilies, here in laurels drest, And there, dark shrouds the banner'd pride invest: These twice twelve banners once in pomp unfurl'd, Spread death and terror round the southern world: In various colors from the staff unroll'd, The lion frown'd, the eagle flamed in gold; Hibernia's heart, reluctant, here was hung, And Scotia's thistle there spontaneous sprung: These twice twelve flags no more shall be display'd, Save in the dome where warlike spoils are laid; Since, where the fathers in high council meet, This hand has placed them prostrate at their feet. So beam the glories of the victor band! And such the dawning hope that cheers our land! Since Gallia's sire, intent on cares of state, Sublimely good, magnanimously great! Protector of the rights of human kind, Weigh'd the dread contest in his royal mind, And bade his fleets o'er the broad ocean fly, To succor realms beneath another sky! Since his blest troops, in happiest toils allied, Have fought, have bled, have conquer'd by your side: The mingled stream, in the same trench that flow'd, Cements the nations by their heroes' blood, Yet still, Columbians, see what choice remains, Ignoble bondage and inglorious chains, Or all the joys which liberty can give, For which you dare to die, or wish to live. On the drawn sword your country's fate depends: Your wives, your children, parents, brothers, friends, With all the tender charities of life, Hang on the issue of the arduous strife. To bolder deeds, and victory's fierce delights, Your country calls, and heaven itself invites. Charm'd by their potent voice, let virtue's flame, The sense of honor, and the fear of shame, The thirst of praise, and freedom's envied cause, The smiles of heroes, and the world's applause, Impel each breast, in glory's dread career, Firm as your rock-raised hills, to persevere. Now the sixth year of independence smiles, The glorious meed of all our warlike toils; Auspicious power, with thy broad flag unfurl'd, Shed thy stern influence on our western world! With thy congenial flame our hearts inspire, With manly patience and heroic fire, The rudest shock of fortune s storm to bear: Each ill to suffer; every death to dare; To rush undaunted in the adventurous van, And meet the Britons, man opposed to man; With surer aim repel their barbarous rage; Shield the poor orphan, and the white-hair'd sage; Defend the matron, and the virgin's charms, And vindicate our sacred rights with arms. This the great genius of our land requires, This the blest shades of our illustrious sires, This the brave sons of future years demand, Cheers the faint heart, and nerves the feeble hand; This sacred hope, that points beyond the span Which bounds this transitory life of man, Where glory lures us with her bright renown, The hero's triumph, and the patriot's crown; The fair reward to suffering virtue given, Pure robes of bliss, and starry thrones in heaven. Changed are the scenes; now fairer prospects rise, And brighter suns begin to gild our skies, The exhausted foe, his last poor effort tried, Sees nought remain, save impotence and pride: His golden dreams of fancied conquest o'er, (And Gallia thundering round his native shore, Iberia aiding with Potosi's mines, While brave Batavia in the conflict joins) Reluctant turns, and, deep involved in woes, In other climes prepares for other foes. Anon, the horrid sounds of war shall cease, And all the western world be hush'd in peace: The martial clarion shall be heard no more, Nor the loud cannon's desolating roar: No more our heroes pour the purple flood, No corse be seen with garments roll'd in blood; No shivering wretch shall roam without a shed; No pining orphans raise their cry for bread; No tender mother shriek at dreams of woe, Start from her sleep, and see the midnight foe; The lovely virgin, and the hoary sire, No more behold the village flame aspire, While the base spoiler, from a father's arms, Plucks the fair flower, and riots on its charms. E'en now, from half the threaten'd horrors freed, See from our shores the lessening sails recede: See the red flags, that to the wind unfurl'd, Waved in proud triumph round the vanquish'd world, Inglorious fly; and see their haggard crew, Despair, rage, shame, and infamy pursue. Hail, heaven-born peace! thy grateful blessings pour On this glad land, and round the peopled shore: Thine are the joys that gild the happy scene, Propitious days, and festive nights serene; With thee gay pleasure frolics o'er the plain, And smiling plenty leads thy prosperous train. Then oh, my friends! the task of glory done, The immortal prize by your bold efforts won: Your country's saviours, by her voice confess'd, While unborn ages rise and call you blest— Then let us go where happier climes invite, To midland seas, and regions of delight; With all that 's ours, together let us rise, Seek brighter plains and more indulgent skies; Where fair Ohio rolls his amber tide, And nature blossoms in her virgin pride; Where all that beauty's hand can form to please, Shall crown the toils of war with rural ease. The shady coverts and the sunny hills, The gentle lapse of ever-murmuring rills, The soft repose amid the noon-tide bowers, The evening walk among the blushing flowers, The fragrant groves that yield a sweet perfume, And vernal glories in perpetual bloom, Await you there; and heaven shall bless the toil, Your own the produce, as your own the soil. No tyrant lord shall grasp a thousand farms, Curse the mild clime, and spoil its fairest charms: No blast severe your ripening fields deform, No volleyed hail-stones, and no driving storm: No raging murrain on your cattle seize, And nature sicken with the dire disease. But golden years, anew, begin their reigns, And cloudless sunshine gild salubrious plains. Herbs, fruits and flowers shall clothe the uncultured field, Nectareous juice the vine and orchard yield; Rich dulcet creams the copious goblets fill, Delicious honey from the trees distil; The garden smile, spontaneous harvests spring, The valleys warble, and the woodlands ring. Along the meads, or near the shady groves, There sport the flocks, there feed the fattening droves; There strays the steed, through bloomy vales afar, Who erst moved lofty in the ranks of war. There, free from envy, cankering care and strife, Flow the calm pleasures of domestic life: There mutual friendship soothes each placid breast, Blest in themselves, and in each other blest. From house to house the social glee extends, For friends in war, in peace are doubly friends: Their children taught to emulate their sires, Catch the warm glow, and feel the kindred fires, Till by degrees the mingling joys improve, Grow with their years, and ripen into love: Nor long the blushing pair in secret sigh, And drink sweet poison from the love-sick eye; Blest be their lot, when in his eager arms The enamor'd youth folds the fair virgin's charms; On her ripe lip imprints the burning kiss, And seals with hallow'd rites the nuptial bliss. Then festal sports the evening hours prolong, The mazy dance and the sweet warbling song: Then each endearment wakes the ravish'd sense To pure delights and raptures most intense: And the pleased parent tells his listening son, What wondrous deeds by him in youth, were done. No sights of woe, no torturing fears annoy The sweet sensation of the heart-felt joy: Nor shall the savages of murderous soul, In painted bands dark to the combat roll, With midnight orgies, by the gloomy shade, On the pale victim point the reeking blade; Or cause the hamlet, lull'd in deep repose, No more to wake, or wake to ceaseless woes: For your strong arm the guarded land secures, And freedom, glory, happiness, are yours! So shall you flourish in unfading prime, Each age refining through the reign of time; A nobler offspring crown the fond embrace, A band of heroes, and a patriot race: Not by soft luxury's too dainty food, Their minds contaminated with their blood: But like the heirs our great forefathers bred, By freedom nurtured, and by temperance fed; Healthful and strong, they turn'd the virgin soil, The untamed forest bow'd beneath their toil: At early dawn they sought the mountain chase, Or roused the Indian from his lurking place; Curb'd the mad fury of those barbarous men, Or dragg'd the wild beast struggling from his den: To all the vigor of that pristine race, New charms are added, and superior grace. Then cities rise, and spiry towns increase, With gilded domes, and every art of peace. Then cultivation shall extend his power, Rear the green blade, and nurse the tender flower, Make the fair villa in full splendors smile, And robe with verdure all the genial soil. Then shall rich commerce court the favoring gales, And wondering wilds admire the passing sails; Where the bold ships the stormy Huron brave, Where wild Ontario rolls the whitening wave, Where fair Ohio his pure current pours, And Mississippi laves the extended shores. Then oh, blest land! with genius unconfined, With polish'd manners, and the illumined mind, Thy future race on daring wing shall soar, Each science trace, and all the arts explore; Till bright religion beckoning to the skies, Shall bid thy sons to endless glories rise. As round thy climes celestial joy extends, Thy beauties ripen, and thy pomp ascends; Farther and farther still, thy blessings roll, To southern oceans and the northern pole; Where now the thorn, or tangled thicket grows, The wilderness shall blossom as the rose; Unbounded deserts unknown charms assume, Like Salem flourish, and like Eden bloom. And oh, my heaven! when all our toils are past, Crown with such happiness our days at last: So rise our sons, like our great sires of old, In freedom's cause, unconquerably bold; With spotless faith, and morals pure, their name Spread through the world, and gain immortal fame. And thou Supreme! whose hand sustains this ball, Before whose nod the nations rise and fall, Propitious smile, and shed diviner charms On this blest land, the queen of arts and arms; Make the great empire rise on wisdom's plan, The seat of bliss, and last retreat of man. THE MONKEY WHO SHAVED HIMSELF AND HIS FRIENDS. A FABLE. A man who own'd a barber's shop At York, and shaved full many a fop, A monkey kept for their amusement; He made no other kind of use on 't— This monkey took great observation, Was wonderful at imitation, And all he saw the barber do, He mimic'd straight, and did it too. It chanced in shop, the dog and cat, While friseur dined, demurely sat, Jacko found nought to play the knave in, So thought he 'd try his hand at shaving. Around the shop in haste he rushes, And gets the razor, soap, and brushes; Now puss he fix'd (no muscle miss stirs) And lather'd well her beard and whiskers, Then gave a gash, as he began— The cat cry'd “waugh!” and off she ran. Next Towser's beard he try'd his skill in, Though Towser seem'd somewhat unwilling: As badly here again succeeding, The dog runs howling round and bleeding. Nor yet was tired our roguish elf; He'd seen the barber shave himself; So by the glass, upon the table, He rubs with soap his visage sable, Then with left hand holds smooth his jaw,— The razor in his dexter paw; Around he flourishes and slashes, Till all his face is seam'd with gashes. His cheeks despatch'd—his visage thin He cock'd, to shave beneath his chin; Drew razor swift as he could pull it, And cut, from ear to ear, his gullet. Humphreys had completed this fable with the exception of the last couplet, and made several attempts to give it that pointed finish which he desired, but coud not succeed. He then went with it to the author of M'Fingal, and told him his difficulty. Trumbull took the piece and read it aloud; then looking upward with that keen glance for which his eye was remarkable, added without pausing— “Drew razor swift as he could pull it, And cut from ear to ear his gullet.” MORAL. Who cannot write, yet handle pens, Are apt to hurt themselves and friends. Though others use them well, yet fools Should never meddle with edge tools. LEMUEL HOPKINS. [The Anarchiad] “In visions fair, the scenes of fate unroll, And Massachusetts opens on my soul. There Chaos, Anarch old, asserts his sway, And mobs in myriads blacken all the way: See Day's stern port, behold the martial frame Of Shays' and Shattuck's mob-compelling name: See the bold Hampshirites on Springfield pour, The fierce Tauntonians crowd the alewife shore. O'er Concord fields, the bands of discord spread, And Worcester trembles at their thundering tread: See from proud Egremont, the woodchuck train Sweep their dark files, and shade with rags the plain. Lo, the court falls; the affrighted judges run, Clerks, lawyers, sheriffs, every mother's son. The stocks, the gallows, lose the expected prize, See the jails open, and the thieves arise. Thy constitution, Chaos, is restored; Law sinks before thy uncreating word; Thy hand unbars the unfathom'd gulph of fate, And deep in darkness whelms the new born state. Bow low, ye heavens, and all ye lands draw near, The voice prophetic of great Anarch hear! From eastern climes, by light and order driven, To me, by fate, this western world was given; My standard rear'd, the realm imperial rules, The last asylum for my knaves and fools. Here shall my best and brightest empire rise, Wild riot reign, and discord greet the skies. Awake, my chosen sons, in folly brave, Stab independence, dance o'er freedom's grave; Sing choral songs, while conquering mobs advance, And blot the debts to Holland, Spain, and France; Till ruin come, with fire and sword and blood, And men shall ask, where your republics stood? Thrice happy race! how bless'd are discord's heirs! Bless'd while they know what anarchy is theirs; Bless'd while they feel, to them alone 't is given To know no sovereign, neither law nor heaven. From all mankind by traits peculiar known, By frauds and lies distinguish'd for mine own, Wonder of worlds! like which to mortal eyes, None e'er have risen, and none e'er shall rise! Lo, the poor Briton, who, corrupted, sold, Sees God in courts, or hears him chink in gold, Whose soul proud empire oft has taught to stray, Far as the western world and gates of day; Though plagued with debts, with rage of conquest curst, In rags and tender-acts he puts no trust; But in the public weal, his own forgets, Finds heaven for him who pays the nation's debts; A heaven like London his fond fancy makes Of nectar'd porter and ambrosial steaks. Not so, Columbia, shall thy sons be known, To prize the public weal above their own; In faith and justice least, as last in birth, Their race shall grow a by-word through the earth: Long skill'd to act the hypocritic part, Grace on the brow, and knavery at the heart, Perform their frauds, with sanctimonious air, Despise good works, and balance sins by prayer. Forswear the public debt, the public cause, Cheat heaven with forms, and earth with tender-laws, And leave the empire, at its latest groan, To work salvation out by faith alone. Behold the reign of anarchy begun, And half the business of confusion done. From hell's dark caverns, discord sounds alarms, Blows her loud trump, and calls my Shays to arms; O'er half the land the desperate riot runs, And maddening mobs assume their rusty guns. From councils feeble, bolder faction grows, The daring corsairs, and the savage foes; O'er western wilds the tawny bands, allied, Insult the state of weakness and of pride; Once friendly realms, unpaid each generous loan, Wait to divide, and share them for their own. Now sinks the public mind; a deathlike sleep O'er all the torpid limbs begins to creep; By dull degrees, decays the vital heat, The blood forgets to flow, the pulse to beat. The powers of life, in mimic death withdrawn, Closed the fix'd eyes with one expiring yawn; Exposed in state to wait the funeral hour, Lie the pale relics of departed power, While conscience harrowing up their souls with dread, Their ghost of empire stalks without a head. No more stands forth to check the rising feud, Their great defender of the public good. Retired, in vain his sighs their fate deplore; He hears, unmoved, the distant tempest roar: No more to save a realm dread Greene appears, Their second hope, prime object of my fears: Far in the south, from his pale body riven, The deathful angel wings his soul to heaven. Here shall I reign, unbounded and alone, Nor men, nor demons shake my baseless throne; Till comes the day—but late oh may it spring— When their tumultuous mobs shall ask a king; A king in wrath shall heaven, vindictive, send, And my confusions and my empire end.” With arms where bickering fires innumerous shine, Like the torn surface of the midnight brine; In sunbright robes, that dazzled as he trod, The stature, motion, armor of a god, Great Hesper rose—the guardian of the clime— O'er shadowy cliffs he stretch'd his arms sublime, And check'd the Anarch old—“Malicious fiend, Eternal curses on thy head descend! Heaven's daring purpose can thy madness mar, To glut thine eyes with ruin, death and war! I know thee, Anarch, in thy cheerless plight, Thou eldest son of Erebus and Night! Yes, bend on me thy brows of hideous scowl, Roll thy wild eyeballs, like the day-struck owl; In Zion blow the trump, resound it far; Fire the red beacons of intestine war; Yet know for this, thyself to penance call'd, Thy troops in terrors, their proud hearts appall'd. Even Shays, that moment when eternal night Rolls darkening shadows o'er his closing sight, Shall feel, 't were better on a plank to lie, Where surging billows kiss the angry sky; 'T were better through a furnace fiery red, With naked feet on burning coals to tread; Than point his sword, with parricidious hand, Against the bosom of his native land. “Where is the spirit of bold freedom fled? Dead are my warriors, all my sages dead? Is there—Columbia bending o'er her grave— No eye to pity, and no arm to save? “Sister of freedom, heaven's imperial child, Serenely stern, beneficently mild, Bless'd independence, rouse my sons to fame, Inspire their bosoms with thy sacred flame! Teach, ere too late, their blood-bought rights to prize, Bid other Greenes and Washingtons arise! Teach those who suffer'd for their country's good, Who strove for freedom, and who toil'd in blood, Once more in arms to make the glorious stand, And bravely die, or save their natal land. “Yes, they shall rise, terrific in their rage, And crush the factions of the faithless age: Bid law again exalt the impartial scale, And public justice o'er her foes prevail: Restore the reign of order and of right, And drive thee, howling, to the shades of night.” Ye sires of nations, call'd in high debate, From kindred realms, to save the sinking state, A boundless sway on one broad base to rear— My voice paternal claims your lingering ear; O'er the wide clime my fostering cares extend, Your guardian genius and your deathless friend. When splendid victory on her trophied car, Swept from these shores the last remains of war, Bade each glad state, that boasts Columbia's name, Exult in freedom and ascend to fame, To bliss unbounded stretch their ardent eyes, And wealth and empire from their labor rise, My raptured sons beheld the discord cease, And soothed their sorrows in the songs of peace. Shall these bright scenes, with happiest omens born, Fade like the fleeting visions of the morn? Shall this fair fabric from its base be hurl'd, And whelm in dust the glories of the world? Will ye, who saw the heavens tempestuous lower, Who felt the arm of irritated power, Whose souls distending with the wasting flood, Prepared the firm foundations, built in blood, By discord seized, will ye desert the plan? The unfinish'd Babel of the bliss of man? Go search the field of death, where heroes, lost In graves obscure, can tell what freedom cost. Though conquest smiled; there slain amid the crowd, And plung'd promiscuous with no winding shroud, No friendly hand their gory wounds to lave, The thousands moulder in a common grave, Not so thy son, oh Laurens! gasping lies, Too daring youth, war's latest sacrifice; His snow-white bosom heaves with writhing pain, The purple drops his snow-white bosom stain; His cheek of rose is wan, a deadly hue Sits on his face, that chills with lucid dew.— There Warren, glorious with expiring breath, A comely corse, that smiles in ghastly death: See Mercer bleed, and o'er yon wintry wall, 'Mid heaps of slain, see great Montgomery fall! Behold those veterans worn with want and care, Their sinews stiffen'd, silver'd o'er their hair, Weak in their steps of age, they move forlorn, Their toils forgotten by the sons of scorn; This hateful truth still aggravates the pain, In vain they conquer'd, and they bled in vain. Go then, ye remnants of inglorious wars, Disown your marks of merit, hide your fears, Of lust, of power, of titled pride accused, Steal to your graves dishonor'd and abused. For see, proud faction waves her flaming brand, And discord riots o'er the ungrateful land; Lo, to the north a wild adventurous crew In desperate mobs the savage state renew; Each felon chief his maddening thousands draws, And claims bold license from the bond of laws; In other states the chosen sires of shame, Stamp their vile knaveries with a legal name; In honor's seat the sons of meanness swarm, And senates base, the work of mobs perform, To wealth, to power the sons of union rise, While foes deride you and while friends despise. Stand forth, ye traitors, at your country's bar, Inglorious authors of intestine war; What countless mischiefs from their labors rise! Pens dipp'd in gall, and lips inspired with lies! Ye sires of ruin, prime detested cause Of bankrupt faith, annihilated laws, Of selfish systems, jealous, local schemes, And union'd empire lost in empty dreams: Your names expanding with your growing crime, Shall float disgustful down the stream of time, Each future age applaud the avenging song, And outraged nature vindicate the wrong. Yes there are men, who, touch'd with heavenly fire, Beyond the confines of these climes aspire, Beyond the praises of a tyrant age, To live immortal in the patriot page; Who greatly dare, though warning worlds oppose, To pour just vengeance on their country's foes. And lo! the etherial worlds assert your cause, Celestial aid the voice of virtue draws; The curtains blue of yon expansion rend: From opening skies heroic shades descend. See, robed in light, the forms of heaven appear, The warrior spirits of your friends are near; Each on his steed of fire (his quiver stored With shafts of vengeance) grasps his flaming sword: The burning blade waves high, and, dipp'd in blood, Hurls plagues and death on discord's faithless brood. Yet what the hope? the dreams of congress fade, The federal union sinks in endless shade, Each feeble call, that warns the realms around, Seems the faint echo of a dying sound, Each requisition wafts in fleeting air, And not one state regards the powerless prayer. Ye wanton states, by heaven's best blessings cursed, Long on the lap of fostering luxury nursed, What fickle frenzy raves, what visions strange, Inspire your bosoms with the lust of change? And frames the wish to fly from fancied ill, And yield your freedom to a monarch's will? Go view the lands to lawless power a prey, Where tyrants govern with unbounded sway; See the long pomp in gorgeous state display'd, The tinsel'd guards, the squadron'd horse parade; See heralds gay with emblems on their vest, In tissued robes tall beauteous pages drest; Where moves the pageant, throng unnumber'd slaves, Lords, dukes, and princes, titulary knaves Confusedly shine, the purple gemm'd with stars, Sceptres, and globes, and crowns, and rubied cars, On gilded orbs the thundering chariots roll'd, Steeds snorting fire, and champing bitts of gold, Prance to the trumpet's voice—while each assumes A loftier gait, and lifts his neck of plumes. High on the moving throne, and near the van, The tyrant rides, the chosen scourge of man; Clarions, and flutes, and drums his way prepare, And shouting millions rend the conscious air; Millions, whose ceaseless toils the pomp sustain, Whose hour of stupid joy repays an age of pain. From years of darkness springs the regal line, Hereditary kings by right divine; 'T is theirs to riot on all nature's spoils, For them with pangs unblest the peasant toils, For them the earth prolific teems with grain, Theirs, the dread labors of the devious main, Annual for them the wasted land renews The gifts oppressive, and extorted dues, For them when slaughter spreads the gory plains, The life-blood gushes from a thousand veins, While the dull herd, of earth-born pomp afraid, Adore the power that coward meanness made. Let Poland tell what woe returning springs, Where right elective yields the crown to kings! War guides the choice—each candidate abhorr'd Founds his firm title on the wasting sword, Wades to the throne amid the sanguine flood, And dips his purple in the nation's blood. Behold, where Venice rears her sea-girt towers, O'er the vile crowd proud oligarchy lowers; While each Aristocrat affects a throne, Beneath a thousand kings the poor plebeians groan. Nor less abhorr'd the certain woe that waits The giddy rage of democratic states; Whose popular breath, high blown in restless tide, No laws can temper, and no reason guide; An equal sway their mind indignant spurns, To wanton change the bliss of freedom turns, Led by wild demagogues the factious crowd, Mean, fierce, imperious, insolent and loud, Nor fame nor wealth nor power nor system draws, They see no object and perceive no cause, But feel by turns, in one disastrous hour, Th' extremes of license and th' extremes of power. What madness prompts, or what ill-omen'd fates, Your realm to parcel into petty states? Shall lordly Hudson part contending powers? And broad Potomac lave two hostile shores? Must Allegany's sacred summits bear The impious bulwarks of perpetual war? His hundred streams receive your heroes slain? And bear your sons inglorious to the main? Will states cement by feebler bonds allied? Or join more closely as they more divide? Will this vain scheme bid restless factions cease? Check foreign wars or fix internal peace? Call public credit from her grave to rise? Or gain in grandeur what they lose in size? In this weak realm can countless kingdoms start Strong with new force in each divided part? While empire's head, divided into four, Gains life by severance of diminish'd power? So when the philosophic hand divides The full grown polypus in genial tides, Each sever'd part, inform'd with latent life, Acquires new vigor from the friendly knife, O'er peopled sands the puny insects creep, Till the next wave absorbs them in the deep. What then remains? must pilgrim freedom fly From these loved regions to her native sky? When the fair fugitive the orient chased, She fix'd her seat beyond the watry waste; Her docile sons (enough of power resign'd, And natural rites in social leagues combined,) In virtue firm, though jealous in her cause, Gave senates force and energy to laws, From ancient habit local powers obey, Yet feel no reverence for one general sway, For breach of faith no keen compulsion feel, And feel no interest in the federal weal. But know, ye favored race, one potent head, Must rule your states, and strike your foes with dread, The finance regulate, the trade control, Live through the empire, and accord the whole. Ere death invades, and night's deep curtain falls, Through ruin'd realms the voice of Union calls; Loud as the trump of heaven through darkness roars, When gyral gusts entomb Caribbean towers, When nature trembles through the deeps convulsed, And ocean foams from craggy cliffs repulsed, On you she calls! attend the warning cry, “Ye live united, or divided die.” ON A PATIENT KILLED BY A CANCER QUACK. Here lies a fool flat on his back, The victim of a cancer quack; Who lost his money and his life, By plaister, caustic, and by knife. The case was this—a pimple rose, South-east a little of his nose; Which daily redden'd and grew bigger, As too much drinking gave it vigor; A score of gossips soon ensure Full threescore different modes of cure; But yet the full-fed pimple still Defied all peticoated skill; When fortune led him to peruse A hand-bill in the weekly news; Sign'd by six fools of different sorts, All cured of cancers made of warts; Who recommend, with due submission, This cancer-monger as magician; Fear wing'd his flight to find the quack, And prove his cancer-curing knack; But on his way he found another,— A second advertising brother: But as much like him as an owl Is unlike every handsome fowl; Whose fame had raised as broad a fog, And of the two the greater hog: Who used a still more magic plaister, That sweat forsooth, and cured the faster. This doctor view'd, with moony eyes And scowl'd-up face, the pimple's size; Then christen'd it in solemn answer, And cried, “this pimple's name is cancer. But courage, friend, I see your 're pale, My sweating plaisters never fail; I've sweated hundreds out with ease, With roots as long as maple trees; And never fail'd in all my trials— Behold these samples here in vials! Preserved to show my wondrous merits, Just as my liver is—in spirits. For twenty joes the cure is done—” The bargain struck, the plaister on, Which gnaw'd the cancer at its leisure, And pain'd his face above all measure. But still the pimple spread the faster, And swell'd, like toad that meets disaster. Thus foil'd, the doctor gravely swore, It was a right-rose cancer sore; Then stuck his probe beneath the beard, And show'd him where the leaves appear'd; And raised the patient's drooping spirits, By praising up the plaister's merits.— Quoth he, “The roots now scarcely stick— I'll fetch her out like crab or tick; And make it rendezvous, next trial, With six more plagues, in my old vial.” Then purged him pale with jalap drastic, And next applied the infernal caustic. But yet, this semblance bright of hell Served but to make the patient yell; And, gnawing on with fiery pace, Devour'd one broadside of his face— “Courage, 'tis done,” the doctor cried, And quick the incision knife applied: That with three cuts made such a hole, Out flew the patient's tortured soul! Go, readers, gentle, eke and simple, If you have wart, or corn, or pimple; To quack infallible apply; Here 's room enough for you to lie. His skill triumphant still prevails, For death 's a cure that never fails. THE HYPOCRITE'S HOPE. Blest is the man, who from the womb, To saintship him betakes, And when too soon his child shall come, A long confession makes. When next in Broad Church-alley, he Shall take his former place, Relates his past iniquity, And consequential grace; Declares how long by Satan vex'd, From truth he did depart, And tells the time, and tells the text, That smote his flinty heart. He stands in half-way-covenant sure; Full five long years or more, One foot in church's pale secure, The other out of door. Then riper grown in gifts and grace, With every rite complies, And deeper lengthens down his face, And higher rolls his eyes. He tones like Pharisee sublime, Two lengthy prayers a day, The same that he from early prime, Has heard his father say. Each Sunday perch'd on bench of pew, To passing priest he bows, Then loudly 'mid the quavering crew, Attunes his vocal nose. With awful look then rises slow, And prayerful visage sour, More fit to fright the apostate foe, Then seek a pardoning power. Then nodding hears the sermon next, From priest haranguing loud; And doubles down each quoted text, From Genesis to Jude. And when the priest holds forth address, To old ones born anew, With holy pride and wrinkled face, He rises in his pew. Good works he careth nought about, But faith alone will seek, While Sunday's pieties blot out The knaveries of the week. He makes the poor his daily prayer, Yet drives them from his board: And though to his own good he swear, Through habit breaks his word. This man advancing fresh and fair, Shall all his race complete; And wave at last his hoary hair, Arrived in deacon's seat. There shall he all church honors have, By joyous brethren given— Till priest in funeral sermon grave, Shall send him straight to heaven. PHILIP FRENEAU. THE DYING INDIAN. “On yonder lake I spread the sail no more! Vigor, and youth, and active days are past— Relentless demons urge me to that shore On whose black forests all the dead are cast: Ye solemn train, prepare the funeral song, For I must go to shades below, Where all is strange, and all is new; Companion to the airy throng, What solitary streams, In dull and dreary dreams, All melancholy, must I rove along! To what strange lands must Shalum take his way? Groves of the dead departed mortals trace; No deer along those gloomy forests stray, No huntsmen there take pleasure in the chase, But all are empty unsubstantial shades, That ramble through those visionary glades; No spongy fruits from verdant trees depend: But sickly orchards there Do fruits as sickly bear, And apples a consumptive visage shew, And wither'd hangs the whortle-berry blue. Ah me! what mischiefs on the dead attend! Wandering a stranger to the shores below, Where shall I brook or real fountain find? Lazy and sad deluding waters flow— Such is the picture in my boding mind! Fine tales indeed, they tell Of shades and purling rills, Where our dead fathers dwell Beyond the western hills, But when did ghost return his state to shew; Or who can promise half the tale is true? I too must be a fleeting ghost—no more— None, none but shadows to those mansions go; I leave my woods, I leave the Huron shore, For emptier groves below! Ye charming solitudes, Ye tall ascending woods, Ye glassy lakes and prattling streams, Whose aspect still was sweet, Whether the sun did greet, Or the pale moon embraced you with her beams— Adieu to all! To all, that charm'd me where I stray'd, The winding stream, the dark sequester'd shade; Adieu all triumphs here! Adieu the mountain's lofty swell, Adieu, thou little verdant hill, And seas, and stars, and skies—farewell, For some remoter sphere! Perplex'd with doubts, and tortured with despair, Why so dejected at this hopeless sleep? Nature at last these ruins may repair, When fate's long dream is o'er, and she forgets to weep. Some real world once more may be assign'd, Some new born mansion for th' immortal mind! Farewell, sweet lake; farewell surrounding woods, To other groves, through midnight glooms, I stray, Beyond the mountains, and beyond the floods, Beyond the Huron bay! Prepare the hollow tomb, and place me low, My trusty bow and arrows by my side, The cheerful bottle, and the ven'son store; For long the journey is that I must go, Without a partner, and without a guide.” He spoke, and bid the attending mourners weep: Then closed his eyes, and sunk to endless sleep! THE WILD HONEYSUCKLE. Fair flower, that dost so comely grow, Hid in this silent, dull retreat, Untouch'd thy honey'd blossoms blow, Unseen thy little branches greet: No roving foot shall find thee here, No busy hand provoke a tear. By Nature's self in white array'd, She bade thee shun the vulgar eye, And planted here the guardian shade, And sent soft waters murmuring by; Thus quietly thy summer goes, Thy days declining to repose. Smit with those charms, that must decay, I grieve to see your future doom; They died—nor were those flowers less gay, The flowers that did in Eden bloom; Unpitying frosts, and autumn's power Shall leave no vestige of this flower. From morning suns and evening dews At first thy little being came: If nothing once, you nothing lose, For when you die you are the same; The space between is but an hour, The frail duration of a flower. THE MAN OF NINETY. To yonder boughs that spread so wide, Beneath whose shade soft waters glide, Once more I take the well known way; With feeble step and tottering knee I sigh to reach my white-oak tree, Where rosy health was wont to play. If to the shades, consuming slow, The shadow of myself, I go, When I am gone, wilt thou remain!— From dust you rose, and grew like me; I man became, and you a tree, Both natives of one grassy plain. How much alike, yet not the same!— You could no kind protector claim; Alone you stood, to chance resign'd: When winter came, with blustering sky, You fear'd its blasts—and so did I, And for warm suns in secret pined. When vernal suns began to glow, You felt returning vigor flow, Which once a year new leaves supplied; Like you, fine days I wish'd to see, And May was a sweet month to me, But when November came—I sigh'd. If through your bark some ruffian arm A mark impress'd, you took th' alarm, And tears awhile I saw descend; Till nature's kind maternal aid A plaister on your bruises laid, And bade your trickling sorrows end. Like you, I fear'd the lightning's stroke, Whose flame dissolves the strength of oak, And ends at once this mortal dream;— You saw, with grief, the soil decay That from your roots was torn away; You sigh'd—and cursed the stream. With borrow'd earth, and busy spade, Around your roots new life I laid, While joy revived in every vein; (The care of man shall life impart—) Though nature owns the aid of art, No art, immortal, makes her reign. How much alike our fortune—say— Yet, why must I so soon decay, When thou hast scarcely reach'd thy prime— Erect and tall, you joyous stand; The staff of age has found my hand, That guides me to the grave of time. Could I, fair tree, like you resign, And banish all these fears of mine, Gray hairs would be no cause of grief; Your blossoms die, but you remain, Your fruit lies scatter'd o'er the plain— Learn wisdom from the falling leaf. As you survive by heaven's decree, Let wither'd flowers be thrown on me, Sad compensation for my doom, While winter-greens and withering pines, And cedars dark, and barren vines, Point out the lonely tomb. The enlivening sun that burns so bright, Ne'er had a noon without a night, So life and death agree; The joys of man by years are broke—” 'T was thus the man of ninety spoke. Then rose, and left his tree. THE INDIAN STUDENT: OR, FORCE OF NATURE. From Susquehanna's farthest springs, Where savage tribes pursue their game, (His blanket tied with yellow strings,) A shepherd of the forest came. Not long before, a wandering priest Express'd his wish with visage sad— “Ah, why (he cried) in Satan's waste, Ah, why detain so fine a lad? “In white man's land there stands a town, Where learning may be purchased low— Exchange his blanket for a gown, And let the lad to college go.” From long debate the council rose, And viewing Shalum's tricks with joy, To Cambridge Hall, o'er wastes of snows, They sent the copper-color'd boy. One generous chief a bow supplied, This gave a shaft, and that a skin; The feathers, in vermilion dyed, Himself did from a turkey win: Thus dress'd so gay, he took his way O'er barren hills, alone, alone! His guide a star, he wander'd far, His pillow every night a stone. At last he came, with foot so lame, Where learned men talk heathen Greek, And Hebrew lore is gabbled o'er, To please the muses,—twice a week. Awhile he writ, awhile he read, Awhile he conn'd their grammar rules— (An Indian savage so well bred Great credit promised to the schools.) Some thought he would in law excel, Some said in physic he would shine; And one that knew him passing well, Beheld in him a sound divine. But those of more discerning eye, Even then could other prospects show, And saw him lay his Virgil by, To wander with his dearer bow. The tedious hours of study spent, The heavy moulded lecture done, He to the woods a hunting went, Through lonely wastes he walk'd, he run. No mystic wonders fired his mind; He sought to gain no learn'd degree, But only sense enough to find The squirrel in the hollow tree. The shady bank, the purling stream, The woody wild his heart possess'd, The dewy lawn, his morning dream In fancy's gayest colors drest. “And why,” he cried, “did I forsake My native wood for gloomy walls; The silver stream, the limpid lake For musty books, and college halls. “A little could my wants supply— Can wealth and honor give me more; Or, will the sylvan god deny The humble treat he gave before? “Let seraphs gain the bright abode, And heaven's sublimest mansions see— I only bow to Nature's God— The land of shades will do for me. “These dreadful secrets of the sky Alarm my soul with chilling fear— Do planets in their orbits fly, And is the earth, indeed, a sphere? “Let planets still their course pursue, And comets to the centre run— In him my faithful friend I view, The image of my God—the sun. “Where nature's ancient forests grow, And mingled laurel never fades, My heart is fix'd and I must go To die among my native shades.” He spoke, and to the western springs, (His gown discharged, his money spent, His blanket tied with yellow strings,) The shepherd of the forest went. THE HURRICANE. Happy the man who, safe on shore, Now trims, at home, his evening fire; Unmoved, he hears the tempests roar, That on the tufted groves expire: Alas! on us they doubly fall, Our feeble bark must bear them all. Now to their haunts the birds retreat, The squirrel seeks his hollow tree, Wolves in their shaded caverns meet, All, all are bless'd but wretched we— Foredoom'd a stranger to repose, No rest the unsettled ocean knows. While o'er the dark abyss we roam, Perhaps, whate'er the pilots say, We saw the sun descend in gloom, No more to see his rising ray, But buried low, by far too deep, On coral beds, unpitied, sleep! But what a stange, uncoasted strand Is that, where fate permits no day— No charts have we to mark that land, No compass to direct that way. What pilot shall explore that realm, What new Columbus take the helm? While death and darkness both surround, And tempests rage with lawless power, Of friendship's voice I hear no sound, No comfort in this dreadful hour— What friendship can in tempests be, What comfort on this troubled sea? The bark, accustom'd to obey, No more the trembling pilots guide; Alone she gropes her trackless way, While mountains burst on either side— Thus, skill and science both must fall; And ruin is the lot of all. THE FIVE AGES. The reign of old Saturn is highly renown'd For many fine things that no longer are found, Trees always in blossom, men free from all pains, And shepherds as mild as the sheep on their plains. In the midland equator, dispensing his sway, The sun, they pretended, pursued his bright way, Not rambled, unsteady, to regions remote, To talk, once a year, with the crab and the goat. From a motion like this, have the sages explain'd, How summer for ever her empire maintain'd; While the turf of the fields by the plough was unbroke, And a house for the shepherd, the boughs of an oak. Yet some say there never was seen on this stage What poets affirm of that innocent age, When the brutal creation from bondage was free, And men were exactly what mankind should be. But why should they labor to prove it a dream?— The poets of old were in love with the theme, And, leaving to others mere truth to repeat, In the regions of fancy they found it complete. Three ages have been on this globe, they pretend; And the fourth, some have thought, is to be without end; The first was of gold—but a fifth, we will say, Has already begun, and is now on its way. Since the days of Arcadia, if ever there shined A ray of the first on the heads of mankind, Let the learned dispute—but with us it is clear, That the era of paper was realized here. Four ages, however, at least have been told, The first is compared to the purest of gold— But, as bad luck would have it, its circles were few, And the next was of silver—if Ovid says true. But this, like the former, did rapidly pass— While that which came after was nothing but brass— An age of mere tinkers—and when it was lost, Hard iron succeeded—we know to our cost. And hence you may fairly infer, if you please, That we 're nothing but blacksmiths of various degrees, Since each has a weapon, of one kind or other, To stir up the coals, and to shake at his brother. Should the Author of nature reverse his decree, And bring back the age we 're so anxious to see, Agreement alas!—you would look for in vain, The stuff might be changed, but the staff would remain. The lawyer would still find a client to fleece, The doctor, a patient to pack off in peace, The parson, some hundreds of hearers prepared, To measure his gifts by the length of his beard. Old Momus would still have some cattle to lead, Who would hug his opinions, and swallow his creed— So it 's best, I presume, that things are as they are— If iron 's the meanest—we 've nothing to fear. EPISTLE TO A GAY YOUNG LADY WHO WAS MARRIED TO A DOATING OLD DEACON. Thus winter joins to April's bloom, Thus daisies blush beside a tomb, Thus, fields of ice o'er rivers grow, While melting streams are found below. How strange a taste is here display'd— Yourself all light, and he all shade! Each hour you live you look more gay, While he grows uglier every day! Intent upon celestial things, He only Watts or Sternhold sings;— You tune your chord to different strains, And merrier notes attract the swains. Ah Harriot! why in beauty's prime Thus look for flowers in Greenland's clime; When twenty years are scarcely run Thus hope for spring without a sun! THE INDIAN BURYING GROUND. In spite of all the learn'd have said, I still my old opinion keep; The posture that we give the dead, Points out the soul's eternal sleep. Not so the ancients of these lands— The Indian, when from life released, Again is seated with his friends, And shares again the joyous feast. His imaged birds, and painted bowl, And ven'son, for a journey dress'd, Bespeak the nature of the soul, Activity, that knows no rest. His bow, for action ready bent, And arrows, with a head of stone, Can only mean that life is spent, And not the finer essence gone. Thou, stranger, that shalt come this way, No fraud upon the dead commit— Observe the swelling turf, and say, They do not lie, but here they sit. Here still a lofty rock remains, On which the curious eye may trace (Now wasted, half, by wearing rains) The fancies of a ruder race. Here still an aged elm aspires, Beneath whose far projecting shade (And which the shepherd still admires) The children of the forest play'd! There oft a restless Indian queen (Pale Shebah, with her braided hair) And many a barbarous form is seen To chide the man that lingers there. By midnight moons, o'er moistening dews, In vestments for the chase array'd, The hunter still the deer pursues, The hunter and the deer, a shade! And long shall timorous fancy see The painted chief, and pointed spear, And Reason's self shall bow the knee To shadows and delusions here. TO THE MEMORY OF THE BRAVE AMERICANS UNDER GENERAL GREENE, IN SOUTH CAROLINA, WHO FELL IN THE ACTION OF SEPTEMBER 8, 1781. At Eutaw springs the valiant died: Their limbs with dust are covered o'er— Weep on, ye springs, your tearful tide; How many heroes are no more! If in this wreck of ruin, they Can yet be thought to claim a tear, O smite thy gentle breast, and say The friends of freedom slumber here! Thou, who shalt trace this bloody plain, If goodness rules thy generous breast, Sigh for the wasted rural reign; Sigh for the shepherds, sunk to rest! Stranger, their humble graves adorn; You too may fall, and ask a tear: 'T is not the beauty of the morn That proves the evening shall be clear. They saw their injured country's wo; The flaming town, the wasted field; Then rush'd to meet the insulting foe; They took the spear—but left the shield. Led by thy conquering genius, Greene, The Britons they compell'd to fly: None distant view'd the fatal plain, None grieved, in such a cause to die. But, like the Parthian, famed of old, Who, flying, still their arrows threw; These routed Britons, full as bold, Retreated, and retreating slew. Now rest in peace our patriot band; Though far from nature's limits thrown, We trust, they find a happier land, A brighter sunshine of their own. PORT ROYAL. Here, by the margin of the murmuring main, While her proud remnants I explore in vain, And lonely stray through these dejected lands Fann'd by the noon-tide breeze on burning sands, Where the dull Spaniard once possess'd these shades, And ports defended by his palisades— Though lost to us, Port Royal claims a sigh, Nor shall the muse the unenvied verse deny. Of all the towns that graced Jamaica's isle, This was her glory, and the proudest pile, Where toils on toils bade wealth's gay structures rise, And commerce swell'd her glory to the skies: St Jago, seated on a distant plain, Ne'er saw the tall ship entering from the main, Unnoticed streams her Cobra's margin lave, Where yon tall plantains shade her glowing wave, And burning sands, or rock-surrounded hill Confess its founder's fears—or want of skill. While o'er these wastes with wearied step I go, Past scenes of death return, in all their wo, O'er these sad shores, in angry pomp he pass'd, Moved in the winds, and raged with every blast— Here, opening gulphs confess'd the Almighty hand, Here, the dark ocean roll'd across the land, Here, piles on piles an instant tore away, Here, crowds on crowds in mingled ruin lay, Whom fate scarce gave to end their noon-day feast, Or time to call the sexton, or the priest. Where yon tall bark, with all her ponderous load, Commits her anchor to its dark abode, Eight fathoms down, where unseen waters flow, To quench the sulphur of the caves below: There midnight sounds torment the sailors ear, And drums and fifes play drowsy concerts there, Sad songs of wo prevent the hour of sleep, And fancy aids the fiddlers of the deep; Dull Superstition hears the ghostly hum, Smit with the terrors of the world to come. What now is left of all your boasted pride! Lost are those glories that were spread so wide, A spit of sand is thine by heaven's decree, And wasting shores that scarce resist the sea: Is this Port Royal on Jamaica's coast, The Spaniard's envy, and the Briton's boast! A shatter'd roof o'er every hut appears, And mouldering brick work prompts the traveller's fears; A church, with half a priest, I grieve to see, Grass round its door, and rust upon its key!— One only inn with tiresome search I found Where one sad negro dealt his beverage round;— His was the part to wait the impatient call, He was the landlord, post-boy, pimp, and all; His wary eyes on every side were cast, Beheld the present, and revolved the past, Now here, now there, in swift succession stole, Glanced at the bar, or watch'd the unsteady bowl. No sprightly lads or gay bewitching maids Walk on these wastes, or wander in these shades; To other shores past times beheld them go, And some are slumbering in the caves below; A negro tribe but ill their place supply, With bending back, short hair, and downcast eye; A swarthy race lead up the evening dance, Trip o'er the sands and dart the alluring glance: A feeble rampart guards the unlucky town, Where banish'd tories come to seek renown, Where worn out slaves their bowls of beer retail, And sunburnt strumpets watch the approaching sail. Here (scarce escaped the wild tornado's rage,) Why sail'd I here to swell my future page! To these dull scenes with eager haste I came To trace the relics of their ancient fame, Not worth the search!—what domes are left to fall, Guns, gales, and earthquakes shall destroy them all— All shall be lost!—though hosts their aid implore, The Twelve Apostles shall protect no more, Nor guardian heroes awe the impoverish'd plain; No priest shall mutter, and no church remain, Nor this palmetto yield her evening shade, Where the dark negro his dull music play'd, Or casts his view beyond the adjacent strand, And points, still grieving, to his native land, Turns and returns from yonder murmuring shore, And pants for countries he must see no more. Where shall I go, what Lethe shall I find To drive these dark ideas from my mind! No buckram heroes can relieve the eye, And George's honors only raise a sigh— Ye mountains vast, whose heights the heaven sustain, Adieu, ye mountains, and fair Kingston's plain, Where nature still the toils of art transcends— In this dull spot the enchanting prospect ends: Where burning sands are wing'd by every blast, And these mean fabrics but entomb the past; Where want, and death, and care, and grief reside, And threatening moons advance the imperious tide, Ye stormy winds, awhile your wrath suspend; Who leaves the land, a bottle, and a friend, Quits this bright isle for yon blue seas and sky, Or even Port Royal quits—without a sigh! ELIJAH FITCH. THE BEAUTIES OF RELIGION. The pencil dipp'd in various hues, to paint Great nature's works, affords a sweet repast. The mind with pleasing views of God is fill'd, His beauteous works more beautiful appear, Which captivate the heart the more they 're view'd, And imitation gives more perfect charms. On fancy's wings ascend the Aonian mount, And let thy pencil sketch the landscape wide; Paint the Castalian fount, rising from foot, Meandering thence through many a flowery mead, Blooming with violet and jessamine. On this side paint a row of lofty elms, Waving with negligence their branching arms; On that let rows of spruce and evergreens Extend through country villages and towns, With birds of every kind perch'd on their boughs. Paint cities then extending on the banks, Whose thousand glittering spires dazzle the morn; And on the placid waves make boats descend With streamers gay, and with their silken sails, Swell'd with Favonian breeze, the breath of eve. Fields next with growing harvests paint, And verdant pastures, fill'd with flocks and herds; And far beyond, a rising wood of pine, And cedar, ash and maple, oak and fir, With shade o'er shade, as in a theatre, Till topmost boughs are lost among the clouds. A lively green to southward make appear, Sloping far distant to the ocean broad, Where lofty ships ride on the foaming main. Far to the north, over a valley huge, Let the sight end abrupt, 'midst rocks and trees: Paint nature here dress'd in her negligee, A sylvan scene, with virgin tresses crown'd; Nor let luxuriant fancy go behind Luxuriant nature in her wild disports. To westward then a winding path, with trees Of goodliest shade, and bowers by nature form'd, From whence a gliding stream may be discern'd; Now roaring down a horrid crag, and then With gentle murmurs wind along the glade. Paint sweet-brier hedges to perfume the air, With pinks and roses strow the eglantine, And crown it with the lily's graceful head. Above let golden orange, nectarine, With cherry, plumb and peach, apple and pear, Bend branches low, tempting the hand to pluck. Along the ground let all the charming race Of berries creep;—and then this motto place: “Fair works of nature are the works of God, And God in all his beauteous works is seen.” SARAH PORTER THE ROYAL PENITENT. PART II. Death's angel now, commission'd by the Lord, O'er the fond infant holds the fatal sword; From the dread sight the frantic father turns, And, clad in sackcloth, in his chamber mourns; The monitor, within the royal breast, That long had slept, now roused at length from rest, Holds forth a mirror to the aching sight, Seizes the mind that fain would take its flight— Bids it look in:—and first, Uriah stood, Arm'd for the fight, as yet unstain'd with blood; Courage and care were on his brow combined, To show the hero and the patriot join'd:— Next, pale and lifeless, on his warlike shield, The soldiers bore him from the bloody field. “And is it thus? (the Royal mourner said) “And has my hand perform'd the dreadful deed? Was I the wretch that gave thee to the foe, And bade thee sink beneath the impending blow? Bade every friend and hero leave thy side?— Open, O earth! and in thy bosom hide A guilty wretch who wishes not to live; Who cannot, dares not, ask for a reprieve; So black a crime just Heaven will not forgive! Justice arrests thy coming mercy, Lord— Strike then, O strike, unsheath thy dreadful sword: Accursed forever be the hated day, That led my soul from innocence astray; O may the stars, on that detested hour, Shed all their influence with malignant power, Darkness and sorrows jointly hold their reign, When time, revolving, brings it round again. Ye injured ghosts, break from the silent tomb, In all the fearful pomp of horror come, Breathe out your woes, and hail the dreadful gloom. Why does not injured Israel now arise, Proclaim my madness to the avenging skies, Hurl quick the sceptre from my bloody hand, While marks of infamy my forehead brand? No time shall e'er the dreadful act conceal— No tongue shall fail its horrors to reveal— Eternity, upon its strongest wing, Shall bear the deeds whence all my sorrows spring. Unhappy man!—ah! whither shall I turn? Like Cain, accurst, must I for ever mourn? On beds of silk in vain I seek repose— Uriah's shade forbids my eyes to close; No bars exclude him—to no place confined, Eager he still pursues my flying mind: Not all the crowd that bow at my approach, Nor guards that thicken round the gilded couch, Can with their arms, or martial air, affright, Or drive the phantom from my wearied sight. Whene'er I view the diamond's varied rays, That grace my robes, or on my sceptre blaze, Uriah still, reflected from the stone, Points at his wounds, and shows me what I've done. Could all the gold that lies on India's coast, Could all the gems its num'rous quarries boast, Bribe peace a moment to this aching heart, How freely with the glitt'ring store I'd part. Black, heavy thoughts, ah! what a num'rous train! I feel your stings unpitied, yet complain. Thou gallant hero, say, where art thou now? Gone, gone for ever! sunk beneath my blow!— Of my uplifted arm, my dire command, Fell Ammon's sword was wielded by my hand! When the fierce battle glow'd with hottest rage, Where all the mighty, arm to arm engage, Where frightful death his various forms put on, You met the terror of his dreadful frown.— As some huge tree, whose tow'ring threats the sky, While deep in earth its roots embosom'd lie, Mocks at the warring winds, and proudly dares The tempest's force, nor once destruction fears: So, unappall'd, the glorious leader stood, Though torn with wounds, and cover'd o'er with blood; O'er hills of slaughter'd foes he makes his way— His sword, from Ammon, gain'd the doubtful day: Yet, while aloft the Hebrew standard flies, And vict'ry shouts to echoing earth and skies, The lifeless hero, stretch'd upon the shield, With countless wounds is borne from off the field. Once, how he shone amidst the gazing throng, Who praised his courage as he pass'd along! On thy firm brow, what beaming splendor shone! By thy bold arm, how strengthen'd was my throne! And shall thy murd'rer crown thy head with bays, And dare thy godlike virtues thus to praise? From cruel fate, ah! whither shall I run?— Capricious lust!—thou hast my soul undone! Drawn on by impious passion, I pursued The flying fair, and oft my suit renew'd; The humble suppliant, and the haughty lord, By turns put on, no ray of hope afford;— She heard at length, but with an obdurate ear— And still Uriah draws the pitying tear. O happy day! when, blest with Eglah's charms, I woo'd no other beauty to my arms; No court's licentious joys did then molest My peaceful mind, nor haunt my tranquil breast. A glitt'ring crown! thou poor, fantastic thing! What solid satisfaction canst thou bring?— Once, far removed from all the toils of state, In groves I slept—no guards around me wait: Oh! how delicious was the calm retreat!— Sweet groves! with birds and various flowers stored, Where nature furnish'd out my frugal board; The pure, unstained spring, my thirst allay'd; No poison'd draught, in golden cups convey'd, Was there to dread.—Return, ye happy hours, Ye verdant shades, kind nature's pleasing bowers— Inglorious solitude, again return, And heal the breast with pain and anguish torn. Oh! sweet content! unknown to pomp and kings, The humble rest beneath thy downy wings; The lowly cottage is thy loved retreat— In vain, thou 'rt courted by the rich and great— In vain, the miser seeks thee in his gold— In vain, each day the glitt'ring store is told; Thou art not there: in vain the ambitious sigh, And seek the joys that still before them fly: The merchant's ship all treasures brings but thee— You from his anxious bosom ever flee: For thee, the sailor tempts the boist'rous main, And hopes to find thee in his dear-bought gain: For thee, the hero mounts his iron car, And hopes to find thee when return'd from war. Their hopes are vain.—Who wish with thee to dwell, Must seek the rural shade, or lonely cell: The Gods themselves delight in verdant groves, And shield from harm the innocence they love.— Witness, the day, my youthful arm withstood The foaming bear:—the monarch of the wood, With open jaws appear'd, and crested mien, But in a moment by my hand was slain: Safe from their teeth I snatch'd the destined prey, And bore it harmless in my arms away.— Witness, the day, Gath's lordly champion came, With haughty strides, and cursed Jehovah's name; Though in my hand nor sword nor spear were found, This vast unwieldly bulk lay stretch'd upon the ground. Beloved by Heaven, nought had I then to fear— Twice I escaped from Saul's emitted spear, By malice thrown; and, free from danger, stand, Hid in the hollow of th' Almighty's hand;— His darling then I was; who, mighty God! Sink now beneath the terrors of thy rod. Dispel those thick, dark clouds, this boist'rous wind, That tears the soul, and harrows up the mind; Oh! let thy mercy, like the solar ray, Break forth and drive these dismal clouds away; Oh! send its kind enliv'ning warmth on one, Who sinks, who dies, beneath thy dreadful frown: Thus fares the wretch at sea, by tempests tost— Sands, hurricanes, and rocks, proclaim him lost; With eager eyes he views the peaceful shore, And longs to rest where billows cease to roar:— Of wanton winds and waves I've been the sport— Oh! when shall I attain the wish'd for port? Or might I bear the punishment alone, Nor hear the lovely infant's piteous moan;— My sins upon the dying child impress'd, The dreadful thought forbids my soul to rest. In mercy, Lord, thy humble suppliant hear— Oh! give the darling to my ardent prayer!— Cleanse me from sin—oh! graciously forgive— Blest with thy love, oh! let thy servant live: Thy smiles withdrawn, what is the world to me? My hopes, my joys, are placed alone on thee: Oh! let thy love, to this desponding heart, One ray, at least, of heavenly love impart.” WILLIAM MOORE SMITH THE FALL OF ZAMPOR. A PERUVIAN ODE. Now ruin lifts her haggard head And madly staring horror screams! O'er yonder field bestrew'd with dead, See, how the lurid lightning gleams! Lo! 'mid the terrors of the storm, From yonder black brow'd cloud of night, The mighty Capac's dreadful form Bursts forth upon my aching sight! But ah! what phantoms, fleeting round Give double horrors to the gloom, Each pointing to the ghastly wound That sent him, shroudless to the tomb! On me they bend the scowling eye; For me their airy arms they wave! Oh! stay—nor yet from Zampor fly, We'll be companions in the grave!— Dear victims of a tyrant's rage! They 're gone!—each shadowy form is fled, Yet soon these hoary locks of age Shall low as theirs in dust be laid! Thou faithless steel, that harmless fell Upon the haughty Spaniard's crest, Swift to my swelling heart, go tell How deep thou 'st pierced thy master's breast. But shall curst Spain's destroying son, With transport smile on Zampor's fate? No ere the deed of death be done The tyrant's blood shall glut my hate. Yon forked flash with friendly glare Points where his crimson'd banners fly, Look down, ye forms of fleeting air, I yet shall triumph ere I die! He spoke—and like a meteor's blaze Rush'd on th' unguarded Spaniard's lord; Around his head the lightning plays— Reflected from his brandish'd sword: “Great Capac nerve the arm of age, And guide it swift to Garcia's breast, His pangs shall all my pangs assuage, His death shall give my country rest. Ye powers who thirst for human blood Receive this victim at your shrine!” Aghast the circling warriors stood Nor could prevent the chief's design. “'T is Garcia's crimson stream that flows, 'T is Zampor hurls him to his fate— The author of my country's woes Now sinks the victim of my hate.” From Garcia's breast the steel he drew And sheathed it deep within his own— “I come, ye gods of lost Peru,” He said—and died without a groan. ODE TO MEDITATION. Oh! thou, who lov'st to dwell Within some far sequester'd cell, Unknown to Folly's noisy train, Untrod by Riot's step profane, Meek Meditation! silent maid, To thee my votive verse be paid; To thee, whose mildly pleasing power Could check wild youth's impetuous flight, And in affection's gloomy night Could soothe the “torturing hour,” To thee the strains belong; But say, what powerful spell, What magic force of song Can lure thy solemn steps, to my uncultured bower By night's pale orb, beneath whose ray With thee thy Plato oft would stray; By the brilliant star of morn That saw thee bend o'er Solon's urn; By all the tears you shed When Numa bow'd his languid head; By the mild joys that in thy breast would swell, When Antonine, by grateful realms adored, Majestic Rome's immortal lord, Would leave the toils, the pomp of state, The crimson splendors of the victor's car, The painful pleasures of the great, The shouts of triumph, and the din of war, In Tiber's hallowed groves with thee to dwell. But ah!—on Grecian plains no more Exists the taste for ancient lore, For from oppression's scourge the muses fled; And Tiber's willow'd banks along Where Maro pour'd the classic song, Grim superstition stalks with giant tread. Yet can Columbia's plains afford The magic spell, the potent word;— A spell to charm thy sober ear, A name to thee, to freedom dear!— By the soft sigh that stole o'er Schuylkill's wave, When he around whose urn Dejected nations mourn, Immortal Franklin sunk into the grave; By his thoughts, by thee inspired; By his works by worlds admired; By the tears by science shed, O'er the patriot's dying head; By the voice of purest fame That gave to time his deathless name, By these, and every powerful spell, Oh! come meek nymph, with me to dwell. The garland weave for Franklin's head, Wreaths of oak from Runnymead, Where the British barons bold Taught their king in days of old, To tremble at insulted Freedom's frown, And venerate the rights her children deem'd their own. For he, like them, intrepid rose Against insulted Freedom's foes, Fix'd the firm barrier 'gainst oppression's plan, And dared assert the sacred rights of man! And in the wreath, which Freedom's hand shall twine To deck her champion's ever honor'd shrine, The victor's laurel shall be seen In folds of never-dying green; The muses too, shall bring Each flow'ret of the spring, Wet with the beamy tears of morn; And there with all her tresses torn, What time meek twilight's parting ray Sinks lingering in nights dun embrace, Pale-eyed Philosophy shall stray In hopes his awful form to trace, Hovering on some pregnant cloud, From whence, while thunders burst aloud, From whence, while through the trembling air In lurid streams the lightnings glare, His rod her head she'll wave around, And lead the harmless terrors to the ground. But, should milder scenes than these Thy sober, pensive bosom please, We'll seek the dark embrowning wood That frowns o'er broad Ohio's flood, And while amid the gloom of night No twinkling star attracts the sight; And while beneath, the sullen tide Shall in majestic silence glide, We'll listen to the notes of wo, By echo borne from plains below, Where Genius droops his laurel'd head, And Honor mourns a Clymer dead. Thou sullen flood, whose dreary shore Has oft been stain'd with streams of gore, Ah! never did a meeker tear Impearl thy banks from Virtue's eye; Ah! never did thy breezes bear A purer breath than Clymer's sigh. Ye plains that saw sedition wave Her impious banners to the wind, With you the youth has found his grave, To you is virtue's friend consign'd; Yet still, as each succeeding race Through time to fate shall pass away, Ah! never shall your sods embrace A dearer pledge than Clymer's clay. Oft o'er the spot that wraps his head Shall Pity's softest tears be shed, There Friendship's sacred form shall come To strow with flowers his Clymer's tomb, And while the queen of night shall shroud Her beams behind some threatening cloud; And while the western mountain's brow The star of eve shall sink below; And while the consecrated ground Mute Melancholy stalks around, There, Meditation, shalt thou find A scene to suit thy sober mind, There Fancy's hand shall form the cell In which thou long shalt love to dwell, And undisturbed by wild sedition's tread, Muse o'er the virtues of the silent dead. LAMPOON. So very deaf, so blind a creature, As Delia, ne'er was seen in nature. Blind to each failing of a friend, But ever ready to commend; Yet not to failings blind alone, Blind to each beauty of her own. So very deaf, that if around A thousand shrill-toned tongues should sound, With scandal tipt, good names to tear, A single word she would not hear; Or, if, by chance, amidst a crowd, Some antiquated maid, so loud, Against a youthful fair should rail, That deafness' self must hear the tale: Her comprehension is so slow, A single word she would not know; Or did she know, so weak her brain, That scandal's tale it can't contain. Yet these are trifles, when compared To things that all the town has heard, For though so stupid, deaf and blind, The greatest charge is left behind; The faults of nature, I'd forgive, But she 's the greatest thief alive. In earliest youth, the cunning chit Had pilfer'd Hermes of his wit! Within a deep embowering wood, A hoary hermit's cottage stood; There as Minerva once retired, To seek the sage herself inspired, While all around was wrapt in night, Save the pale student's glimmering light, She came with worse than burglar's tread, And filch'd the helmet from her head! She robb'd the Graces of their charms, And off she ran with Cupid's arms. She stole the queen of beauty's zone, And made Diana's smiles her own; Nor does she ever spend a day But what she steals some heart away; E'en while I write this hasty line, I feel, I feel she 's stealing mine. Yes—stupid, deaf and blind's the creature, And yet the greatest thief in nature. JOHN D. M'KINNON THE MOHAWK. The morn now glittering on the sandy brows Of Alba's sloping city, westward spreads A canopy of azure o'er the woods And smiling lakes. The Mohawk's Falls we seek; And, turning to the rich and fragrant vales That westward wind, approach the fractured steep, In hoarse and silver fountains, where he pours His urn amongst the far resounding rocks. Let Science tell the mighty cause that erst The mountain fabric's horizontal base Upturning, gave the roaring waters vent Along their lacerated bed, slate-paved, And branching to the Hudson; while the muse, With humbler views, the cataract admires, In streams of foam, where, glancing down The precipice, it widens to a gulf, And amphitheatre of quarried rocks, Their sylvan brows with spiral cedars set, Or coppice crown'd; and issuing through the vale, With pleasing murmur steals along the shrubs And shadowy elms.—Here, where the Mohawk gazed, And wonder'd at th' abode vortiginous Of his tremendous father, in the rocks And flood impassable, see Art pervades E'en Nature's ruins, with aspiring hand Stretch'd o'er the torrent's foam, the rifted banks Uniting, with such works as Rome, when throned On nations, wrought. Across a giddy pile Of wood the horseman now pursues his way, Succeeded by the length'ning herd and swains In slow procession, while beneath them roars The headlong river. Leaving now the Falls, With all their grander lineaments, behind, We pass along the peaceful Mohawk's shore, And trace the vale where'er the fruitful stream, Meandering from the west, the distant hills Receding designate. In front a width Of richest intervale, our champaign route, Within the smiling scenes of husbandry, Far westward leads. Beneath its willowy banks The fertilizing stream glides down the vale, Now intersecting in an equal course, and now Inclining to the north; now south it laves The sidelong hills' ascent; then winding off, Sleeps, high embower'd, within the spreading growth Of pensive elms that tower luxuriant o'er The elders, and with hanging plane trees mix Their graceful limbs and interwoven shade. As frequent thus the silent stream escapes The traveller's eye incurious, while it lurks In silence by, hoarse murmurs wake his ear At intervals, as o'er the rapid shoals The obstructed water fluctuating shoots Among the broken rocks. The antique fronts We gain, wrapt in Batavian gloom of sheds And intermingled trees, where Corlear first, Advancing from the sandy desert, fix'd His dwelling on the margin of the still And sable river. Academic Peace And Meditation now consign the spot To future Science. Here the dusty road Forsaking for the verdant turf, we scent The fragrance of the evening, and survey The shore, enamor'd of its pensive scenes. Harmonious, tranquil, which thy genius, Claude, Taught by the sober Fancies, had confess'd her own. Amidst the shade suspended o'er the vale, The mirror of the Mohawk's tide reflects A varied tapestry: the vivid green Of willows interwove—the plane tree's hoar And dappled waist—the pensive, sombre elm, Queen of the Flats, her hanging robes diffuse And graceful. Fronting in perspective dim, A range of mountain, from the Kaatskill's loins Projected, in a promontory falls Sublime in distant grandeur on the shore; While through its horizontal firs, the west, Still beaming with effulgence, dyes the stream With ardent yellow. Night, contemplative, Now drops her veil. How pleasing 't is to trace, Upon the map of Time, the varied scenes Of this revolving world; some nearly lost In dim Oblivion's haze—some living yet Upon the tablet of the memory— And some in letter'd annals of the past! The Flats, that stretching west, yield their rich increase Of yellow harvests to the spacious barns, sustain'd a sullen growth of wood, And through the unchronicled domain of Day Lay in tranquility and solitude; Till first the roving Huron glanced across, Quick as his arrow that pursued the deer; And, hailing in the lonely chace his devious mate, With shoutings wild, beside Schoharie's brooks, Or Canajohary's echoing cliffs, First broke the silence of the wilderness. The houseless pair, encamping then, unstripp'd The beech's yellow stem, and cased their walls Of clay, or matted boughs; purloining yet, Unconscious of their distant arrow's wing, The squirrel of his life, or pheasant, clothed With dappled feathers to his heels. Then came Some friend or kinsman, with his toiling wife, Their quiver'd boys and dog; and huts soon join'd To huts, had form'd society, and taught, By stationary life's progressive arts, Its hard-earn'd comforts. But eternal laws, Employing man's own vengeance as the means To bring abortion on his works, forbade. Some hostile tribe, with carnage unappeased, Lean, wandering, with invidious eyes beheld Their haunts, and lurk'd in ambush near their huts; Then fell on them defenceless; in a night Up-rooted all their works, and half their race Destroy'd. Th' industrious colonists were chased, Unshelter'd, through the woods, and left behind No relic but their scalps. The Mohawks next And firm confederate friends, unused to war, And studious of ignoble tillage, lash'd By fierce oppressors from their homes, traced out On Caughnawaga's meads, or 'neath Caroga's pines, Their rude encampments. Hate and dark design, Though stifled, kindling in their vengeful hearts Infuriate love of arms. Their origin, And whence their wild forefathers stray'd, No annals tell; whether inclining toward The peaceful ocean, where the sun at eve, Upon the shining mountains lights his fires, On Arathbuscaw's hungry shores, and where The arctic circle girds the piny rocks And lakes, in vast congeries round them spread; Or southward from th' illimitable plain Depastured by erratic buffaloes, Where, hovering round the herds, th' Assinipoils Upon their tongues and marrowy haunches feast. Where'er the roving ancestors were born, 'T was here their spirited and martial sons First sung the war-song—here on frequent spots Which now the dwarfish oak and pine o'erspread, And where the sumach scatters on the lap Of autumn, azure-cheek'd, its pinnated And scarlet leaves, once stood their huts; 't was here Their arrows first they sharpen'd, to transfix The Adirondac tyrants, seated round The blanketed and tawny sachems smoked In council, or the yellin bands, inspired Like frantic Bacchanals, with fierce grimace, And gesture fiend-like, beat the war dance: here, By vengeance nursed, they raised a flame, That, from the ocean to Machibon's gate, Spread conflagration through the woods. The foe, Unconscious of their strength, secure, remote, And unsuspecting, till he heard the shrieks Of savage fury, and the warriors bald, Besmear'd with ochre, issued from their haunts, Flinging their brandish'd tomahawks, with eyes Red as the crouching panther's. None escaped, Resisting or resistless, from their blows. The aged sire struck lifeless on his seat; The panting bosom gored, that press'd the babe It nourish'd. Devastation swept o'er all The scene, and stain'd the ruin'd stage with blood. Rejoicing then, the victors to their vales, Renown'd for empire, march'd with the acclaim Of triumph: every proud and valiant hut Was nail'd with bleeding scalps; and tribes remote Gave tributary homage to the Wolf, The Turtle and the Bear. The fosse still marks Their castle's range, and in the lonely woods, In hieroglyphics, still remain their boasts Of conquest, and their graves. Next Ceres came, With German reapers in her train, and strow'd Her harvests on the furrow'd width of flats. Press'd by her golden sandals, we admire The soil fructiferous, and scenes dress'd out By smiling industry, that now reigns o'er The wild demesnes of war. Pursuing west The sinuating stream within its vales Of lengthening meadows, insulated oft With steep ascent, we reach the rising ground Of aromatic pines, where, jutting south, The elevated shore confronting meets Schoharie's stony creek. The opening hills Unfold its distant course, far in the blue And mountainous horizon lost. A rich And flourishing expanse of vale then leads Beyond the confluent waters, through the meads, From Caughnawaga to a stately ridge Of mountain granite, piled in lofty tiers, Aerial, strutting in the scene. Here stopp'd The prospect of our level course—We pause In contemplation on the massy ribs Developed, that maintain our earthly stage, Till, length, the opening flats unfold the tower And shapely roofs of Palatine—its plain And intervening fields with herbage spread, Or crested corn; while sloping woodlands topp'd With soaring pines, the Mohawk's bushy verge O'ershadow, and the eye contemplative In admiration fix. Where is the mind That honors truth, and in this transient day Of perishable nature, 'mid the scoffs And turmoil of a selfish world, would still Preserve serene and animate the brows Of virtuous sentiment, that does not seek In rural peace a refuge from its sighs? What though ambition wear a crown—the fangs Of avarice be fill'd with gold—esteem And dear-bought wealth enrich the tongue that wins By syren eloquence; yet happier he, Whom, in his valleys, ringing with the axe, The setting sun forsakes, amidst the works Of growing settlement. Delightful cares! That, in perspective of the future, charm Beyond the plaudits of ephemeron praise. How bless'd the prospect, to behold, each hour, Increasing all around, expansive life And happiness—their rapid progress urged By ardent toil, invigorate by hope! Though none here revel on the silken couch Of zoneless pleasure, Friendship still may dwell With Peace and Love, more sweet than is the voice Of Fame, when from Parnassus she proclaims, In melodies that vibrate betwixt heaven And earth, her hero's actions. But, renew'd Our journey, we pursue the mountain's stony edge, Where the Caroga issues from the wild And desert heights, in elevated range Of sylvan tops far northward stretch'd, and where, Below, its cataract pours down the hoarse Canadian creek; till, rising in our front, The mountains close, where once, perhaps, their rocks, In one unbroken chain, the Mohawk's mass Of waters, o'er the German flats and plains Of Herkimer, suspended in a broad Primeval lake, till, issuing through the strait's Disjointed pass, and roaring granite rocks, The lake, descending, left its reedy bounds, And bed of slime, exhaling to the sun. And now the airy Flats we pass, their church, Litigious hall, and taverns, and approach The gloomy shade of dark continuous wood, That runs high westward to the Mohawk's fount. Unbroken here the waste—half settled here The towering trees on new-born fields recline— Disorder'd, hewn, the venerable stems And branching limbs surround their parent trunks, That in the blackening conflagration still Survive, and to the scythe of Time alone, That levels all things, yield: a sturdy few Yet standing, girdled by the fatal knife, In slow destruction waste, upon their sprays And airy summits quench'd the vital lymph; In wintry desolation group'd, they pine 'Midst summer's genial solstice. Thriving near, Their comrades flourish; tall, columnar bass, With fluted shafts aspiring; oaks that stretch Their vigorous arms; the hemlock, sombre topp'd The yellow birch, her silken boddice half Unlaced; and maple, delicately seam'd. Athwart the solemn woods, of vast extent, Stem beyond stem, in series infinite, With vaulting foliage shadow'd as we pass, The lively sun oft darts his influence; And, 'midst the humid trees, an open square, The hospitable roof of logs rough hewn, Excorticate reveals. Aside, empaled, The garden flourishes with roseate flowers; And at the door the children gambol near; Their lily-featured mother still intent On busy cares domestic; while the sire Along the echoing causeway drives his kine, Or plies his axe far sounding. Thus, beloved And happy scenes! a pensive wanderer, I have trod your wilds, enamor'd much Of Nature in her simplest guise, though sunk At heart, and anxious to forsake the world And all its vain, deceitful blandishments. When these solicitous and weary eyes Are closed through many a summer's reign, your vales Shall flourish, each succeeding year shall yield New stores of wealth, and future ages bless The works, the zeal, the wisdom of the past. SAMUEL LOW WINTER. “How changed, how fallen” now the landscape lies, Which late with beauty's image bless'd our eyes; Loved summer scenes, ah! whither have ye fled? Ye short-lived charms, no sooner loved than dead! Dear rural prospects, once with verdure graced, But now by Winter's blighting touch laid waste; Fair objects, that on mortal sense could pour Delights, that glad man's torpid sense no more; Once all your charms, with ever new delight, In swift succession rose upon my sight; With secret rapture often have I gazed On Nature's gifts, and Nature's Author praised; When genial showers enrich'd the teeming earth, And vernal warmth gave vegetation birth, Then throbb'd my heart, by Winter's blast unchill'd, And speechless feelings through my bosom thrill'd; Or when the fervor of a summer sun Matured what Spring's creative power had done; Or recent Autumn's yellow fields appear'd, And health and hope the rustic owner cheer'd; When bounteous harvests well repaid his toil, And various plenty made the country smile; When every wish indulgent Nature crown'd, And shed her gifts exuberant around, Enraptured I beheld,—the hours were spent In warm acknowledgment and calm content. While thus I call to mind enjoyments past, And with them Winter's dreary scenes contrast, On evanescent good while mem'ry dwells, The gloomy retrospect my bosom swells; Desponding images my thoughts employ, The wreck of beauty, and the death of joy: Dismantled earth inspires the soul with dread— Loved Summer's scenes! ah, wherefore have ye fled? Long gath'ring vapors now to clouds increased, Surcharged with frosty stores, involve the east: Bleak Eurus there prepares his chilling blasts, A weight of snow the burthen'd air o'ercasts; Of keener cold and piercing frosts I sing, Engend'ring in the air, which soon will cling Fast hold on all beneath, which soon will throw A robe of whiteness over all below: Stern Winter, now confirm'd, in wrath impends; With all his gloomy ensigns he descends; For, lo! he gives the ripen'd mischief birth, And shakes his vapory produce on the earth: 'T is come, dread Winter's hoary badge is come, And bids the earth prepare to meet its doom. By Eurus driven through the sluggish air, The shower, minute and light, flies wavering there; But soon, o'er all the atmosphere dispersed, Creation in its bosom lies immersed: Perpetual driving snow obscures the skies, Commixing heaven and earth while thus it flies; The spreading ruin overwhelms the plains, And dazzling whiteness over nature reigns; Its weight oppressive swells the hills, and lo! Beneath accumulating heaps of snow, How yonder trees, with drooping branches, stand In white array, a venerable band! How close the fleecy shroud to earth adheres! How uniform the boundless scene appears! Wide and more wide the spotless waste prevails, Till aching vision at the prospect fails; Till the spent gale an ermine mantle flings O'er all this sublunary scene of things. Nor have the clouds spent all their downy store, But on the earth a frozen deluge pour: Still more collecting, unexhausted still, Though subtile flakes each lurking fissure fill, And every vale exalts itself a hill. Meanwhile the cattle shun the whelming waste, With quicken'd speed for shelter home they haste, Mournful, and ruminating as they go, And shaking from their sides the cumb'rous snow: Arrived at home, the dumb expecting band, For entrance, near their hovels shivering stand; The lowing kine the milker's hand intreat, And oft the call importunate repeat; Son'rous and long resounds the lowing strain; The hills reponsive bellow back again. There too the fleecy tribe their pittance crave, Which once the herbage wild spontaneous gave; And clam'rous bleat for their accustom'd meal, Which cold made scant, and now thick snows conceal. There chanticleer the storm undaunted braves, Proud o'er the feather'd throng his plumage waves; He spurns the snow, the blast he does not reck, But, crowing shrill, exalts his glossy neck. The steed rears graceful there his tow'ring size, With head erect he gazes on the skies, And prances wild, and snuffs the chilling air, And neighs, impatient for the owner's care: Nor long the helpless brutes his succor ask, Soon, whistling, comes the peasant to his task; Them large supplies of provender to spare, And house them safe is his assiduous care. Next comes the thrifty milk-maid, early taught To shun destructive sloth, which oft hath brought Its slaves to want, to vice, disease and wo, And all the num'rous evils mortals know; She comes to drain the kine; industrious she, Domestic work to ply; with heartfelt glee, She treads her native snow, she cheerly sings Her simple rural strains, and with her brings Her ample pails, pure as contiguous snow, Which soon with copious streams of milk o'erflow. Now, laden with the luscious spoil, she trips, And, as she treads incautious, often slips: The peasant too, returns in jocund mood; His herds, well housed, enjoy their sav'ry food; From cold and hunger free, they there abide, Nor aught of comfort wish or know, beside. But oft, devoid of such a friendly shield, To savage winter's ruthless grasp they yield; The fleecy flocks are buried oft in snow, And undiscover'd breathe in depths below; The anxious shepherd seeks his charge in vain, And rambles joyless o'er the desert plain; But if he chance to find the smother'd race, Their breath, that thaws the snow, denotes the place; The lengthy hook he gladly then suspends, By this the suff'rer, scarce alive, ascends; While those remain whom death the power denies To make the snow-dissolving breath arise. By hunger urged, the nimble-footed deer O'er snow-crown'd heights pursues his swift career; The hapless brute by huntsmen's toils annoy'd. Oft meets the fate he labors to avoid; A vale, replete with snow, betrays his steps, Incautious in the fatal depth he leaps; In vain he struggles now himself to clear, And panting, dreading, sees his foes draw near; They come, they wound, they slay the guiltless beast:— Already fancy riots at the feast; Big tears hang trembling in his dying eyes, Unmoved they hear the captive's piteous cries, Exulting, grapple their expiring prey, And, loud rejoicing, bear the prize away. Nor yet contented with the lusty prize, Insatiate man to meaner conquests flies: He skirts the forest, and he beats the copse, The hare and squirrel now invite his hopes: In hollow trees, and burrows under ground, He careful pries, and looks expectant round. If now the parent hare hath left her haunt, In quest of sustenance her offspring want, The helpless young, in man's deep arts unskill'd, To his perfidious stratagem must yield: The dam, improvident of winter's store, Now dubious roams abroad in search of more; And, spurr'd by pressing want, the snow disturbs, To glean precarious food from wither'd herbs; But deadly guns her anxious search cut short, Or traps insidious lie where game resort; Or, if she shun these snares, a harder fate, Severer evils her return await: Her haunt she enters, but the hapless hare Beholds nor mate, nor harmless offspring there, And dies with cold, with hunger and despair. The fowler too the meads and woods explores; With his remorseless feats the country roars; With cautious step, and big with hope and fear, He pauses now, and now approaches near, And eyes the feather'd flock through all their flight, Till on some tempting meadow they alight, Within his reach; then points, with steady hand, The fatal engine to the heedless band; Swift from the tube escapes the leaden death, That lays them prostrate, gasping out their breath; While others, startled at the ruthless deed, Precipitate and wild, forsake the mead; But many, flying, meet the death they shun, And swifter ruin leaves the murd'rous gun; Through yielding air it flies, with thund'ring sound, And hurls its conquest on the blood-stain'd ground! On skates of wood the sons of Lapland go. To hunt the elk o'er endless tracts of snow, Nor heed the cavities which lurk below: Upon the snow-topp'd surface far and wide, Accoutred for the chase, they fearless slide; The huntsman, fleet and fierce as winter's wind, Each moment leaves a length'ning space behind; Mad with desire his object he pursues, Too late the beast his luckless fortune rues; The sanguine foe, with horizontal aim, Darts instantaneous ruin to the game; Dextrous he manages the missile bow, That lays his victim's branching antlers low; The deathful weapon cuts th' aerial space, And crowns the triumph of the savage chase! TO A VIOLET. Though not the gaudy Tulip's drap'ry fine, Yet thou, fair plant, canst Tyre's rich purple boast; The beauty of the Amethyst is thine; Thy neat and simple garb delights me most; Unseen and shadowy forms, of tiny size, Delicious dew-drops from thy surface sip, Feast on thy charms their microscopic eyes, And breathe thy sweets, as o'er thy leaves they trip. Emblem of innocence and modest worth, Who lov'st the eye of rude remark to shun, Whose lovely, lowly form still tends to earth, Unlike the flower which courts the mid-day sun; Thou seem'st, sweet flow'ret, of his beam afraid;— Thus merit ever loves and seeks the shade. TO A SEGAR. Sweet antidote to sorrow, toil and strife, Charm against discontent and wrinkled care. Who knows thy power can never know despair; Who knows thee not, one solace lacks of life: When cares oppress, or when the busy day Gives place to tranquil eve, a single puff Can drive even want and lassitude away, And give a mourner happiness enough. From thee when curling clouds of incense rise, They hide each evil that in prospect lies; But when in evanescence fades thy smoke, Ah! what, dear sedative, my cares shall smother? If thou evaporate, the charm is broke, Till I, departing taper, light another. TO THE GENIUS OF POETRY. Genius of tuneful verse! inspired by whom, Divine Mæonides in numbers first Dawn'd on a world o'ercast with mental gloom, And strains sublime to barb'rous Greece rehearsed; Spirit of song! from whose Castalian fount The Mantuan poet sweet instruction drew; With piercing ken to whose Aonian mount, Once Albion's bards on eagle pinions flew; Though far aloof thy vot'ry stretch his wing, That o'er no classic land presumes to soar, Him hast thou taught in plaintive strains to sing, To feel thy solace, and thy power adore; And, spite of envy's futile venom, thou Hast placed a leaf of laurel on his brow. BENJAMIN PRATT DEATH. Though guilt and folly tremble o'er the grave, No life can charm, no death affright the brave. The wise at nature's laws will ne'er repine, Nor think to scan or mend the grand design That takes unbounded nature for its care, Bids all her millions claim an equal share. Late in a microscopic worm confined, Then in a prison'd fetus drown'd the mind; Now of the ape kind both for sense and size, Man eats and drinks and propagates and dies. Good God! if thus to live our errand here, Is parting with life's trifles worth our fear? Or what grim furies have us in their power, More in the dying than the living hour. Ills from ourselves, but none from nature flow, And virtue's road cannot descend to wo. What nature gives, receive, her laws obey; If you must die tomorrow, live today. The prior states thy mind has varied through Are drown'd in Lethe where black waves pursue, To roll oblivion o'er each yesterday, And will tomorrow sweep thyself away. But where? no more unknown in future fate Than your own end or essence in this state. The past, the future and our nature hid, Now comic and now tragic scenes we tread. Unconscious actors: with a drama run And act a part, but for a plot unknown. We see their shapes, we feel ten thousand things, We reason, act and sport on fancy's wings, While yet this agent, this percipient lies Hid from itself and puzzles all the wise. In vain we seek, inverted eyes are blind, And nature form'd no mirror for the mind. Like some close cell whence art excludes the day, Save what through optics darts its pencil'd ray, And paints the lively landscape to the sight, While yet the room itself is veil'd in night. Nor can you find with all your boasted art, The curious touch that bids the salient heart Send its warm purple round the venal maze, To fill each nerve with life, with bloom the face. How o'er the heart the numbing palsies creep To chill the carcase to eternal sleep. 'T is ours t' improve this life, not ours to know From whence this meteor, when or where 't will go. As o'er a fen when heaven 's involved in night, An ignis fatuus waves its new-born light, Now up, now down, the mimic taper plays As varying Auster puffs the trembling blaze; Soon the light phantom spends its magic store, Dies into darkness, and is seen no more. Thus run our changes, but in this secure, Heaven trusts no mortal's fortune in his power. Nor hears the prayers impertinent we send To alter fate, and providence to mend. As well in judgment as in mercy kind, God hath for both the fittest date design'd. The wise on death, the fools on life depend, From toils and pains some sweet reverse to find. Scheme after scheme the dupe successive tries, And never gains, but hopes to gain the prize. From the delusion still he ne'er will wake, But dream of bliss, and live on the mistake. Thus Tantalus in spite the furies placed Tortured and charm'd to wish, and yet accursed: In every wish infatuate, dreads lest Jove Should move him from the torments of his love To see the tempting fruit and stream no more, And trust his Maker on some unknown shore. Death buries all diseases in the grave, And gives us freedom from each fool and knave, To worlds unknown it kindly wafts us o'er— Come death, my guide, I'm raptured to explore. JOSEPH LATHROP THE EXISTENCE OF A DEITY. When I lift up my wond'ring eyes, And view the grand and spacious skies, “There is a God!” my thoughts exclaim, Who built this vast stupendous frame. The sun by day with glorious light, The moon with softer rays by night, Each rolling planet, glowing star, Wisdom and power divine declare. The lightning's blaze, the thunder's roar, The clouds, which wat'ry blessings pour, The winter's frost, the summer's heat, This pleasing, awful truth repeat. The forest and the grassy mead, Where wild beasts roam, or tame ones feed, Corn, springing from the lifeless clod, Confess the agency of God. My body form'd with nicest art, My heaving lungs, and beating heart, My limbs, obsequious to my will, Show forth my Maker's power and skill. The various passions of the mind, The powers of reason more refined, Bold fancy's flight, each lively sense Prove a supreme intelligence. A God so great and always near, Shall be the object of my fear; His goodness, wisdom, truth, and love, Shall my best passions ever move. My care shall be, his sacred will To understand and to fulfil: His service shall my life employ, His favor is my highest joy. STEPHEN SEWALL ON THE DEATH OF GEORGE II. Of cypress deign, celestial muse, to sing; To plaintive numbers tune the trembling string, And soothe the gen'ral grief.— The voice of joy 's no more, On Albion's sadden'd shore: He 's gone—Britannia's royal chief! From the north to southern pole, From the farthest orient floods To Hesperia's savage woods, Swelling tides of sorrow roll: Nor wonder; all an ample share Partook, through boundless climes, of his paternal care. Whate'er the muse's mournful lays can do, And more, blest shade! to thy loved name is due. Under thy gentle sway, Religion, heaven-born fair, In her own native air, Refulgent shone in golden day: Virtue, science, liberty, Blooming sisters, wreathed with bays, Grateful sung their patron's praise: Commerce, o'er the broad-back'd sea, Extending far on floating isles, Imported India's wealth, and rich Peruvian spoils. Let Rome her Julius and Octavius boast; What both at Rome, George was on Albion's coast. An olive-wreath his brow, Majestic, ever wore; Unless by hostile power Long urged, and then the laurel bough. Faithful bards, in epic verse, Vict'ries more than Julius won, And exploits, before undone, George the Hero, shall rehearse: While softer notes each tuneful swain Shall breathe from oaten pipe, of George's peaceful reign. But, ah! while on the glorious past we dwell, Enwrapt in silken thought, our bosoms swell With pleasing ecstacy, Forgetful of our wo. —Shall tears forbear to flow? Or cease to heave the deep-fetch'd sigh? Flow, ye tears, forever stream; Sighs, to whisp'ring winds complain; Winds, the sadly-solemn strain Waft, and tell the mournful theme. But what, alas! can tears or sighs? What could, has ceased to be; the spirit mounts the skies. With sympathetic wo, thy noontide ray, Phœbus, suspend; ye clouds, obscure the day; Her face let Cynthia veil, Thick darkness spread her wing, And the night-raven sing, While Britons their sad fate bewail. Sacred flood, whose crystal tide, Gently gliding, rolls adown Fast by, once, the blissful town, Thames! with pious tears supply'd, Swell high, and tell the vocal shore And jovial mariner, their glory's now no more! But stop, my plaintive muse: lo! from the skies What sudden radiance strikes our wond'ring eyes? As had the lab'ring sun, From black and dismal shades, Which not a ray pervades, Emerging, with new lustre shone. In the forehead of the east, See the gilded morning star, Of glad day the harbinger: Sighing, now, and tears are ceased: Still George survives; his virtues shine In him, who sprung alike from Brunswick's royal line. JAMES BOWDOIN WOMAN. Nature, fair creature! when she form'd thy mind, Form'd thee a fit companion for mankind: Not merely to excite love's genial fire; And with a flood of joy to quench desire: Nor wantonly to sport the hours away; Nor, like a slave, man's lawless will obey; But to assist him in life's num'rous toils; To cheer him in misfortune with your smiles; To soothe his breast when troubles overbear; And with your love to recompense his care: To raise his drooping spirits in distress; And with your own promote his happiness. But who is she whom every grace surrounds; Whom every grace with all that's lovely crowns; By nature form'd to touch a gen'rous breast; By nature form'd to make man amply blest? Yonder she walks along in virgin bloom: And where she walks the rose's sweets perfume. See from her presence fly ill-boding fear; And every gloom before her disappear! See innocence with cheerfulness combine, Sit on her brow, and in her actions shine! See modesty adorn her lovely cheek, And in her language and behaviour speak! See temp'rance in due bounds restrain desire; And give a check to passion's lawless fire! Humility and meekness, round her head, Are as a crown of circling glory spread: Discretion ripens with her growing years, And on her brow in sceptred state appears: When scandal tarnishes a rising name, And throws from tongue to tongue her neighbor's fame, Her soul disdains to spread the scandal round; And, far from wid'ning, strives to heal the wound. Unrival'd goodness warms her gen'rous breast; And there—its native home—takes up its rest: O'er her it bears so uncontroll'd a sway, She thinks all nature does its laws obey: She harbors no suspicion in her mind; But judges by herself of all mankind. These virtues, with a graceful freedom crown'd, Spread far and wide her character around. Among her virtues prudence bears the sway, And shines abroad with a distinguish'd ray. In all she does, it uniformly guides; And o'er her conduct constantly presides. Softness and love with a majestic mien, Speak in her eye, and in her looks are seen. Her tongue harmonious music warbles round; And on her lips is honey's sweetness found. Sacred to truth, and by its laws confined, Her lips impart the language of her mind. With a becoming grace her words appear; And, like her honest heart, are all sincere. By custom and example undecoy'd, With cheerful mind she keeps herself employ'd: Each day's revolving sun her task renews; Nor does her hand the welcome task refuse: To that—her mind so uniformly bends; To that, with so much constancy attends; That morning visits (destined to amuse; To talk of dress, laced waistcoats, and the news; To spread the scandal of the night before; And, that once done, prepare the way for more) Ne'er interrupt the business of the day; Nor by their levity her mind betray: Much less shall rabbles, which the sex debase, Or routs, or drums her character disgrace. By wisdom sway'd, she thus her hours employs; And thus employ'd, a tranquil mind enjoys: A tranquil mind—that very far outweighs The applause of crowds; and even her own just praise. Thus fame from such a course of action springs; And bears her high upon its rapid wings; Thus fame, thus inward peace—so heaven ordains— Flows from one source, and lasting strength obtains. JOHN LOWELL LINES. No more let ancient times their heroes boast, Since all their fame in George's praise is lost; Not Greece—her Alexanders; Cæsars—Rome For worth and virtue view our Monarch's tomb. Restless ambition dwelt in Cæsar's mind, He murder'd nations and enslaved mankind: He found a gen'rous people great and free, And gave them tyrants for their liberty. The glorious Alexander, half divine, Whose godlike deeds in ancient records shine, Dropt his divinity at every feast; And lost the god and hero in the beast. Shall then our monarch be with these compared, Or George's glory with a Cæsar shared: No—we indignant spurn the unworthy claim: George shines unrivall'd in the lists of fame: For while he reign'd, each virtue, every grace Beam'd from his throne, and sparkled in his face: While justice, goodness, liberty inspired, And Britain's freedom all his conduct fired. His people's father was his highest boast; And in that name was all the sovereign lost. Justice which left the world since Saturn's reign, In him returning blest these realms again; Even rigid justice with compassion join'd, Sweetly uniting in his generous mind. But why should we on separate features dwell, When the great picture does in each excel? No single virtues strike us with surprise; All come united to the admiring eyes. PETER OLIVER [Lines] Cease then the rapid tear, nor vainly urge The mournful gloom, erect the pensive eye To where the virtuous man is rank'd above; See there the cloudless soul, unfetter'd, free From every terrene clog that here so late His flight retarded to the throne of God. See his exulting spirit, mounted high On wings of love celestial, basking full In the calm sunshine of the Deity. There, every tear wiped from his eyes, he views The rushing glories of the world of light, He drinks the stream of pleasure, pure, unmix'd, That flows incessant from the sacred fount: His ears delighted with angelic harps, He tunes his own, and joins the sacred choir: The odors from the golden tree of life, Which fill all heaven with fragrance, he inhales, And feels, enraptured, all those joys that flow From converse with the Godhead, face to face. WILLIAM LADD. AROUET TO AMANDA. Once more, dear maid, the wretched Arouet writes; His pen obedient, as his heart indites; These lines may haply waste your precious time, And his loathed writings may be deem'd a crime. Thou say'st that friendship can afford a cure To the deep wounds, the sorrows I endure; The generous thought with rapture I pursue— It must be lovely, for it comes from you. But O how poor is friendship to express “The soul-felt pang of exquisite distress.” Once I was happy—blest with native ease, A friend could cheer me, and a book could please; But now no joys from books or friendship flow, Not one poor respite to my load of wo. Did not you, dearest, see my fond distress, Beyond all power of language to express? The whirling thought, the swift impassion'd kiss, Delirium sweet and agony of bliss. How have I listen'd when your accents broke, And kiss'd the air that trembled as you spoke. Death, friendly Death will soon relieve my pain, Long sure he cannot be implored in vain. When to my sight the monarch of the tomb Shall rise terrific and pronounce my doom; Will then Amanda, ah! she will, I trust, Pay the last tribute to my clay-cold dust: Will sighing say, here his last scene is o'er, Who loved as mortal never loved before. Dear, matchless maid! that kind concern display'd, Would sweetly soothe my melancholy shade. O'er my lone tomb O yield that sad relief; Breathe the soft sigh and pour out all your grief; Or shed one tear in pity as you pass, And just remember that your Arouet was. REMONSTRANCE OF ALMASA ALLICAWN, WIFE OF ALMAS ALLICAWN, TO WARREN HASTINGS.It was said that Warren Hastings, having taken the husband of this lady, one of the eastern princes, prisoner, agreed to save his life for a ransom, and that he took the ransom and put the king to death. My subjects slaughter'd, my whole kingdom spoil'd; My treasures wasted and my husband slain. O say, vile monster! art thou satisfied? Hast thou, rapacious brute! sufficient wealth? Hastings! my husband was your prisoner— The wealth of kingdoms flew to his relief; You took the ransom, and you broke your faith. Almas was slain—'t was perjury to your soul; But perjury 's a little crime with you. In souls so black, it seem'd almost a virtue. Say, cruel monster! art thou thirsting still For human gore? O may'st thou ever thirst, And may the righteous gods deny thee water To cool thy boiling blood, inhuman wretch! And, bloody ruffian! thou must go where Almas Sits on a throne of state, and every hour He stabs an Englishman, and sweetly feasts Upon his bloody heart and trembling liver. Yet, Hastings, tremble not, for thou art safe, Yes, murderer! thou art safe from this repast: A heart polluted with ten thousand crimes, Is not a feast for Almas, he will pluck That savage heart out of its bloody case, And toss it to his dogs; wolves shall grow mad By feeding on thy murderous carcase. More, When some vile wretch, some monster of mankind, Some brute like thee, perhaps thy relative, Laden with horrid crimes without a name, Shall stalk through earth, and we want curses for him, We'll torture thought to curse the wretch, and then, To damn him most supreme, we'll call him Hastings. THE WAR HORSE. PARAPHRASE FROM JOB. Again the Almighty from the whirlwind broke, And thus to Job, in stern continuance, spoke: “Didst thou the horse with strength unequall'd mould, Whose lofty neck the writhen thunders fold? And canst thou make the intrepid courser fly, When steely dangers glitter in his eye? “See all around him spreads the flamy cloud, Spurn'd from his nostrils, while he snorts aloud, Trembling with vigor, how he paws the ground, And hurls the thunder of his strength around! Behold! he pants for war, and scorning flight, Collects his strength and rushes to the fight. “When clouds of darts a sable horror spread, And the full quiver rattles o'er his head: To him no dread the sound of battle bears, The clash of armor and the strife of spears; But o'er his neck his waving mane reclined, Spreads to the gale and wantons in the wind: He spurns the field, fierce, terrible, and strong, And rolls the earth back as he shoots along. “Lo! where the strife the distant warriors wage, The neighing courser snuffs the sanguine rage; While roaring trumpets and the dire affray Provoke his laughter on that dreadful day; More loud he snorts, more terrible he foams, When nearer still the storm of battle comes; And mingling roars are dreadful on the heath, In shouts of victory, and groans of death.” RETIREMENT. Hail, sweet retirement, hail! Best state of man below, To smooth the tide of passions frail, And bear the soul away from scenery of wo. When, retired from busy noise, Vexing cares and troubled joys, To a mild serener air, In the country we repair: Calm enjoy the rural scene, Sportive o'er the meadows green: When the sun's enlivening ray Speaks the genial month of May, Lo! his amorous, wanton beams Dance on yonder crystal streams; In soft dalliance pass the hours, Kissing dew-drops from the flowers, While soft music through the grove, Sweetly tunes the soul to love. And the hills harmonious round Echo with responsive sound; There the turtle-dove alone, Makes his soft, melodious moan; While from yonder bough 't is heard, Sweetly chirps the yellow-bird: There the linnet's downy throat Warbles the responsive note; And to all the neighboring groves, Robin Redbreast tells his loves. There, Amanda, we might walk, And of soft endearments talk; Or anon we 'd listen, love, To the gently-cooing dove. In some sweet, embowering shade, Some fair seat by nature made, I my love would gently place, On the tender woven grass: Seated by thy lovely side, Oh, how great would be my pride! While my soul should fix on thine, Oh the joy to call thee mine! For why should doves have more delight, Than we, my sweet Amanda, might? And why should larks and linnets be More happy, lovely maid, than we? There the pride of genius blooms, There sweet contemplation comes: There is science, heavenly fair, Sweet philosophy is there; With each author valued most, Ancient glory, modern boast. There the mind may revel o'er Doughty deeds of days of yore; How the mighty warriors stood, How the field was dyed in blood, How the shores were heap'd with dead, And the rivers stream'd with red; While the heroes' souls on flame, Urged them on to deathless fame. Or we view a different age Pictured in the historic page— Kings, descending from a throne; Tyrants, making kingdoms groan, With each care to state allied, And all the scenery of pride. Or perhaps we'll study o'er Books of philosophic lore; Read what Socrates has thought, And how godlike Plato wrote; View the earth with Bacon's eyes; Or, with Newton, read the skies; See each planetary ball, One great sun attracting all: All by gravitation held, Self-attracted, self-repelled: We shall cheat away old time, Passing moments so sublime. Hail, sweet retirement, hail! Best state of man below, To smooth the tide of passions frail, And bear the soul away from scenery of wo. WHAT IS HAPPINESS? 'T is an empty, fleeting shade, By imagination made: 'T is a bubble, straw, or worse 'T is a baby's hobby-horse: 'T is two hundred shillings clear; 'T is ten thousand pounds a year: 'T is a title, 't is a name; 'T is a puff of empty fame; Fickle as the breezes blow; 'T is a lady's yes or no! And when the description's crown'd, 'T is just no where to be found. Arouet shows, I must confess, Says Delia, what is happiness; I wish he now would tell us what This self-same happiness is not. What happiness is not? I vow, That, Delia, you have posed me now: What it is not—stay, let me see— I think, dear maid, 't is—not for me. EDWARD CHURCH. THE DANGEROUS VICE ?????????. Behold the Merchant! once with plenty bless'd, Whom fortune favor'd, and whom friends caress'd; Who with rich dainties his loved offspring fed, And quaff'd enjoyments from the fountain head; Whose stores were full, whose flagons running o'er, And every smiling year was adding more; Yet nobly all for liberty resign'd, For equal liberty with all mankind. Behold him now! from his possessions hurl'd, Stripp'd by a faithless and ungrateful world; Reluctant forced from clime to clime to roam, To earn a pittance for his starving home; Or—if at home—to want and misery driven, Looks round—and wonders at the ways of Heaven. By foes, by country robb'd—by treaty sold— A poor, dependent slave when he is old— Of credit, prospects, friends, and hope bereft, And nought but family, and feelings left; Beggar'd, forgotten, and despondent grown, He lives a stranger, and he dies unknown. See the poor soldier! maim'd and seam'd with scars, His hard-earn'd wages in his country's wars, His crazy carcase tott'ring to a fall, Propt by a crutch, or by some friendly wall, Or hobbling on to some sequester'd spot, Muses in vain on man's unequal lot; Arrived—he rests him on the humble ground, To soothe the anguish of a smarting wound: When lo! a witness of his toils appears, Who on his breast the pendent eagle The badge of the order of the Cincinnati. bears; The houseless vet'ran lifts his misty eyes, Descries the badge—then mutters in the skies— “Scars are the badges which poor soldiers wear, Who for their thankless country bravely dare.” Ape not the fashions of the foreign great Nor make your betters at your levees wait, Resign your awkward pomp, parade and pride, And lay that useless etiquette aside; The unthinking laugh, but all the thinking hate Such vile, abortive mimicry of state; Those idle lackeys, sauntering at your door, But ill become poor servants of the poor; Retrench your board, for e'en the guests who dine, Have cause to murmur at your floods of wine; Think not to bribe the wise with their own gold, Though fools by flimsy lures should be cajoled; Places on places multiply to view, Creation on creation, ever new; Therefore in decent competence to live, Is all that you can ask, or justice give: An humbler roof—could Madam condescend— But heaven forbid I should the sex offend! The chariot, too—pray who can live without, And keep distinguished from the rabble rout? All genteel people deem it a reproach To go to plays, balls, routs, in hackney coach; And as to walking—'t is so vulgar now— Ladies have left it off, and scarce know how. Women, I grant, are frequent in the street, But real ladies, Sir, you 'll rarely meet. But who art thou, who durst advice intrude, So very prudent, and so very rude? Take back thy niggard counsel, nor presume O'er our bright sunshine to diffuse thy gloom; Heads of Departments should be amply paid: Places for this sole purpose have been made: All are not like old Cincinnatus now, To take up their old trades, or dirty plough. Ye would-be titled! whom, in evil hour— The rash, unthinking people clothed with power, Who, drunk with pride, of foreign baubles dream, And rave of a Columbian diadem— Be prudent, modest, moderate, grateful, wise, Nor on your country's ruin strive to rise, Lest great Columbia's awful god should frown, And to your native dunghills hurl you down. Ye faithful guardians of your country's weal, Whose honest breasts still glow with patriot zeal! The lawless lust of power in embryo quell, The germe of mischief and first spawn of hell. Within your sacred walls let virtue reign, And greedy Mammon spread his snares in vain. With unlick'd lordlings sully not your fame, Nor daub our patriot with a lacker'd name. O Washington! thy country's hope and trust! Alas! perhaps her last, as thou wert first; Successors we can find—but tell us where Of all thy virtues we shall find the heir? But if—which heaven avert!—we must have kings, With all the curses the tiara brings, Let us not frame the idol we adore, But own the monster of some distant shore, Bow to some foreign god, already grown, Nor make a mongrel tyrant of our own, To mimic monarchs, on his mimic throne: Whom to equip with every gewgaw thing Due to the proud regalia of a king, Would beggar all his slaves of all their store, And still the insatiate ape would gape for more. Speak boldly then—ye wise!—and act in season, What but to think, tomorrow may be treason. From small beginnings mighty mischief springs, And soon the eaglet soars on eagle's wings. Stifle the tyrant in his infant birth, Or soon he 'll stalk a giant on the earth, Tread on your necks, break all your barriers down, Smile into life—and murder with a frown; Disdain the balance, late the favorite theme, And with his ponderous fiat kick the beam. Dream not that homespun tyrants are the best, Home-made or foreign, every king 's a pest, Sent in God's wrath—O scatter not the seed, Nor damn Columbia with a royal breed. Great Washington! Columbia's prop and pride, Her friend, her father, guardian god and guide; If kings like thee could love, like thee could feel, And know no wish but for their country's weal, Or 'mongst the human race, if we could find, Like thee to govern and to bless mankind; Then might Americans unblushing own Such worth would almost sanctify a throne. Ye chosen people of the King of kings, From whose behest your present being springs; Who stamp'd this title on your federal birth, Subjects in heaven—but citizens on earth; Who gave you to possess these happy plains Where peace and plenty dwell, and freedom reigns; Freedom! the glorious prize—should ye resign, Vengeance awaits you from the power divine; Freedom! which heroes earn'd with their best blood, And patriots bought with every other good; Freedom! which roused the Roman's honest zeal Against his friend to lift the fatal steel, Freedom! which those firm patriots deified, Who in Rome's senate stabb'd the parricide. Freedom! for fair Columbia bravely won By the long toils of virtuous Washington, Ne'er basely barter for a paltry crown, “But piously transmit the blessing down.” SAMUEL EWING. REFLECTIONS IN SOLITUDE. To me, no heedless, listless looker on, The idle fashions of a thoughtless race Are pleasant. Though my feeble voice swell not The hum of crowds, nor do I judge it wise To mingle in their scenes, I do not yet Forget my kind. Lull'd to tranquillity By charms that Nature, in a kindly mood, Grants, in profusion, to the lover-breath Of youthful spring, I seek the grassy side Of this clear brook. I deem it not unwise To woo seclusion at the morning hour. What place, along the hedge, the op'ning rose, Peeps through the trembling dews, while all the wood Rings with the varied strains of gratitude That nature's children breathe, as flutt'ring light From bough to bough, they make their duty, pleasure. Driven, by a thankless world, to seek Content In rural scenes, I sought and found her there. With her it solaces me much to while, In musings sweet, an idle hour away, On gifts that God has lavish'd on mankind. The last, the sweetest boon he gave to man, Was Love. In Eden's bowers the cherub first Was found. What hour uncoffin'd ghosts steal out, To sit by new-made graves, or stand behind The village matron's chair, to counterfeit The clicking of the clock, or, yet more rude, Tap at the window of the dreaming maid, Or glide in winding-sheet across the room, Borrowing the form that late her lover wore; Upon a moon-beam, at such silent hour, The boy descended, and, alighting soft, Chose for his throne the mild blue eye of Eve. On either pinion sat a fairy form To guide the arrows, that, in wanton mood The boy would hazard—This Romance was named, And Fancy, that—One pluck'd, with busy hand, Soft down from doves, and, artful, twined it round The arrow's head, to hide from mortal eyes The scorpion sting that barb'd the weapon's point. While that, with syren smile, a mirror show'd On whose smooth surface danced, in angel robes, Perfection's form. And ever from that night, The sportful twins attend the train of Love. Thus was the garden, first by Adam's voice, Call'd Paradise. And now what spot the boy His transient visit pays, in wilderness Or bower, or palace, or the lowly shed, Man names it Paradise, nor errs he much In such a name. Though oft the side-long look, The heavy sigh, that speaks the anxious doubt; The flitting blush that lights the virgin's cheek; The mind, abstracted from the present scene; Eyes, idly fix'd unconscious on the hearth; The trembling lip, and melancholy mien; Though these, no dubious signs, proclaim the boy The city's visitor, he yet prefers To hold his court by moon-light, in the grove, Or where the babbling brook winds through the wood, Or where on shady side of sloping hill, The green vine crawls, or where innum'rous boughs, Raising each other's leaves just over head, Keep the rude sun-beam from the lover's couch, The grassy bank. Here Love his revels keeps, While every breeze blows health, and every wind, That sweeps the maiden's locks, and shows new charms, Makes music sweeter than Apollo's lyre. Sweet is the landscape, wild and picturesque, To him, the youth, whose glowing fancy paints The love-crown'd cottage as the seat of bliss! Sweet is the forest's twilight gloom, and sweet The May-morn ramble! Sweet to pace along The farm-boy's path, that, winding through the wood, Leads to variety, within whose bounds Alone is found the food that never cloys! But sweeter far than brook, or walk, or wood, Or May-morn ramble, or the evening stroll, Far sweeter than imagination's stores, The stolen interview with her he loves! Sweet is the voice of Nature to his ear, Long pain'd with list'ning to the tale of vice! Sweet is the mock-bird's counterfeited note! And sweet the murm'ring of the busy bee! Sweet is the distant bell, at silent eve, That guides the cow-boy where the cattle stray! Sweet is the lengthen'd, still increasing sound, Of horn that calls from meadows, wood, or field, The weary lab'rer to his healthful meal! The flute may cheat his melancholy mind Of many a fancied ill, and as its strains Float on the evening breeze, may gather mild And mellowing influence to his greedy ear, By mingling with the moonbeams! Yet to him No note so musical—no strain so sweet As sighs that tell his fond—his doubting heart, The love she would, but cannot hide from him! ST GEORGE TUCKER. STANZAS. Days of my youth, Ye have glided away: Hairs of my youth, Ye are frosted and gray: Eyes of my youth, Your keen sight is no more: Cheeks of my youth, Ye are furrow'd all o'er: Strength of my youth, All your vigor is gone: Thoughts of my youth, Your gay visions are flown. Days of my youth, I wish not your recall: Hairs of my youth, I'm content ye should fall: Eyes of my youth, You much evil have seen: Cheeks of my youth, Bathed in tears have you been: Thoughts of my youth, You have led me astray: Strength of my youth, Why lament your decay? Days of my age, Ye will shortly be past: Pains of my age, Yet awhile ye can last: Joys of my age, In true wisdom delight: Eyes of my age, Be religion your light: Thoughts of my age, Dread ye not the cold sod: Hopes of my age, Be ye fix'd on your God. J. HOPKINSON. HAIL COLUMBIA. Hail Columbia! happy land! Hail ye heroes! heaven born band! Who fought and bled in freedom's cause, And when the storm of war was gone, Enjoy'd the peace your valor won. Let independence be our boast, Ever mindful what it cost; Ever grateful for the prize, Let its altar reach the skies. Firm—united—let us be, Rallying round our liberty; As a band of brothers join'd, Peace and safety we shall find. Immortal patriots! rise once more; Defend your rights, defend your shore: Let no rude foe, with impious hand Invade the shrine where sacred lies, Of toil and blood the well-earn'd prize. While offering peace, sincere and just, In Heaven we place a manly trust, That truth and justice will prevail, And every scheme of bondage fail. Sound, sound the trump of fame, Let Washington's great name Ring through the world with loud applause, Let ev'ry clime to freedom dear, Listen with a joyful ear. With equal skill, and god-like power, He govern'd in the fearful hour Of horrid war; or guides, with ease, The happier times of honest peace. Behold the Chief, who now commands, Once more to serve his country stands— The rock on which the storm will beat, But arm'd in virtue, firm and true, His hopes are fix'd on Heaven and you. While hope was sinking in dismay, And glooms obscured Columbia's day, His steady mind, from changes free, Resolved on Death or Liberty. RICHARD B. DAVIS TO A SLEEPING INFANT. Sweet are thy slumbers, innocence, reclined On the fond bosom of maternal love; Calm as the lake whose waters gently move, Wafting the spirit of the dying wind. For thee affection wakes with pleasing care, Delighted smiles, and breathes the fervent prayer. Far different is sleep, when labor faints On his hard couch, when restless avarice quakes; When from the scene of dread that conscience paints, Affrighted guilt with sudden horror wakes; When from the eye of day misfortune shrinks, And on his bed of thorns despondent sinks. When night recalls the toilsome day of care, When hopeless love catches in short repose Scenes that alike his aching bosom tear, Visions of shadowy bliss or real woes. For dreams like these, and nights of anxious pain, Manhood thy peaceful slumbers must resign, And all his boasted wisdom sigh in vain For the calm blessings of a sleep like thine. THOU ART THE MUSE. No genius lends its sacred fire To animate my song; To me no heaven-presented lyre Or muse-taught verse belong. She who first charm'd my soul to love, Inspired the tuneful breath; With love-instructed hand I wove For her the early wreath. To her the softest strains I owe Who first inspired the flame; And sweetest shall the numbers flow, When graced with Emma's name. TO EMMA. I've seen the loveliest roses blow That Hudson's verdant banks adorn; I 've seen the richest crimson glow That paints the smiling face of morn: I 've listen'd while the evening gale, (Fraught with the sweets of many a flower, Wafted sweet incense through the vale, And bless'd the contemplative hour. Sweet tints the blushing rose adorn, And sweet the rays of morning shine Sweet are the sounds by zephyrs borne, But sweeter charms, my fair, are thine. The rose shall droop, its charms shall fade, Clouds shall obscure the brightest day; Music shall cease to bless the shade, And even thy beauties must decay: But the bright flame that warms thy breast, Beams from those eyes, and tunes that tongue, Virtue—shall ever shine confess'd, And ever claim my noblest song.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. JOEL BARLOW. THE HASTY PUDDING. CANTO I. Ye Alps audacious, through the heavens that rise, To cramp the day and hide me from the skies; Ye Gallic flags, that o'er their heights unfurled, Bear death to kings, and freedom to the world, I sing not you. A softer theme I choose, A virgin theme, unconscious of the Muse, But fruitful, rich, well suited to inspire The purest frenzy of poetic fire. Despise it not, ye bards to terror steel'd, Who hurl your thunders round the epic field; Nor ye who strain your midnight throats to sing Joys that the vineyard and the still-house bring; Or on some distant fair your notes employ, And speak of raptures that you ne'er enjoy. I sing the sweets I know, the charms I feel, My morning incense, and my evening meal, The sweets of Hasty Pudding. Come, dear bowl, Glide o'er my palate, and inspire my soul. The milk beside thee, smoking from the kine, Its substance mingled, married in with thine, Shall cool and temper thy superior heat, And save the pains of blowing while I eat. Oh! could the smooth, the emblematic song Flow like thy genial juices o'er my tongue, Could those mild morsels in my numbers chime, And, as they roll in substance, roll in rhyme, No more thy awkward unpoetic name Should shun the muse, or prejudice thy fame; But rising grateful to the accustom'd ear, All bards should catch it, and all realms revere! Assist me first with pious toil to trace Through wrecks of time, thy lineage and thy race; Declare what lovely squaw, in days of yore, (Ere great Columbus sought thy native shore) First gave thee to the world; her works of fame Have lived indeed, but lived without a name. Some tawny Ceres, goddess of her days, First learn'd with stones to crack the well dried maize, Through the rough sieve to shake the golden shower, In boiling water stir the yellow flour: The yellow flour, bestrew'd and stirr'd with haste, Swells in the flood and thickens to a paste, Then puffs and wallops, rises to the brim, Drinks the dry knobs that on the surface swim; The knobs at last the busy ladle breaks, And the whole mass its true consistence takes. Could but her sacred name, unknown so long, Rise, like her labors, to the son of song, To her, to them, I 'd consecrate my lays, And blow her pudding with the breath of praise. Not through the rich Peruvian realms alone The fame of Sol's sweet daughter should be known, But o'er the world's wide clime should live secure, Far as his rays extend, as long as they endure. Dear Hasty Pudding, what unpromised joy Expands my heart, to meet thee in Savoy! Doom'd o'er the world through devious paths to roam, Each clime my country, and each house my home, My soul is soothed, my cares have found an end, I greet my long lost, unforgotten friend. For thee through Paris, that corrupted town, How long in vain I wandered up and down, Where shameless Bacchus, with his drenching hoard, Cold from his cave usurps the morning board. London is lost in smoke and steep'd in tea; No Yankee there can lisp the name of thee; The uncouth word, a libel on the town, Would call a proclamation from the crown. For climes oblique, that fear the sun's full rays, Chill'd in their fogs, exclude the generous maize: A grain, whose rich, luxuriant growth requires Short gentle showers, and bright etherial fires. But here, though distant from our native shore, With mutual glee, we meet and laugh once more. The same! I know thee by that yellow face, That strong complexion of true Indian race, Which time can never change, nor soil impair, Nor Alpine snows, nor Turkey's morbid air; For endless years, through every mild domain, Where grows the maize, there thou art sure to reign, But man, more fickle, the bold license claims, In different realms to give thee different names. Thee the soft nations round the warm Levant Polanta call, the French of course Polante. E'en in thy native regions, how I blush To hear the Pennsylvanians call thee Mush! On Hudson's banks, while men of Belgic spawn Insult and eat thee by the name Suppawn. All spurious appellations, void of truth; I 've better known thee from my earliest youth, Thy name is Hasty-Pudding! thus our sires Were wont to greet thee fuming from their fires; And while they argued in thy just defence With logic clear, they thus explain'd the sense:— “In haste the boiling cauldron, o'er the blaze, Receives and cooks the ready powder'd maize; In haste 't is served, and then in equal haste, With cooling milk, we make the sweet repast. No carving to be done, no knife to grate The tender ear, and wound the stony plate; But the smooth spoon, just fitted to the lip, And taught with art the yielding mass to dip, By frequent journeys to the bowl well stored, Performs the hasty honors of the board.” Such is thy name, significant and clear, A name, a sound to every Yankee dear, But most to me, whose heart and palate chaste Preserve my pure hereditary taste. There are who strive to stamp with disrepute The luscious food, because it feeds the brute; In tropes of high-strain'd wit, while gaudy prigs Compare thy nursling, man, to pamper'd pigs; With sovereign scorn I treat the vulgar jest, Nor fear to share thy bounties with the beast. What though the generous cow gives me to quaff The milk nutritious: am I then a calf? Or can the genius of the noisy swine, Though nursed on pudding, thence lay claim to mine? Sure the sweet song, I fashion to thy praise, Runs more melodious than the notes they raise. My song resounding in its grateful glee, No merit claims: I praise myself in thee. My father loved thee through his length of days! For thee his fields were shaded o'er with maize; From thee what health, what vigor he possess'd, Ten sturdy freemen from his loins attest; Thy constellation ruled my natal morn, And all my bones were made of Indian corn. Delicious grain! whatever form it take, To roast or boil, to smother or to bake, In every dish 't is welcome still to me, But most, my Hasty Pudding, most in thee. Let the green succotash with thee contend, Let beans and corn their sweetest juices blend, Let butter drench them in its yellow tide, And a long slice of bacon grace their side; Not all the plate, how famed soe'er it be, Can please my palate like a bowl of thee. Some talk of Hoe-Cake, fair Virginia's pride, Rich Johnny-Cake, this mouth has often tried; Both please me well, their virtues much the same Alike their fabric, as allied their fame, Except in dear New England, where the last Receives a dash of pumpkin in the paste, To give it sweetness and improve the taste. But place them all before me, smoking hot, The big, round dumpling, rolling from the pot, The pudding of the bag, whose quivering breast, With suet lined, leads on the Yankee feast; The Charlotte brown, within whose crusty sides A belly soft the pulpy apple hides; The yellow bread whose face like amber glows, And all of Indian that the bake-pan knows,— You tempt me not—my fav'rite greets my eyes, To that loved bowl my spoon my instinct flies. CANTO II. To mix the food by vicious rules of art, To kill the stomach, and to sink the heart, To make mankind to social virtue sour, Cram o'er each dish, and be what they devour; For this the kitchen muse first framed her book, Commanding sweat to stream from every cook; Children no more their antic gambols tried, And friends to physic wonder'd why they died. Not so the Yankee—his abundant feast, With simples furnish'd and with plainness drest, A numerous offspring gathers round the board, And cheers alike the servant and the lord; Whose well-bought hunger prompts the joyous taste, And health attends them from the short repast. While the full pail rewards the milk-maid's toil, The mother sees the morning cauldron boil; To stir the pudding next demands their care; To spread the table and the bowls prepare; To feed the children, as their portions cool, And comb their heads, and send them off to school. Yet may the simplest dish some rules impart, For nature scorns not all the aids of art. E'en Hasty-Pudding, purest of all food, May still be bad, indifferent, or good, As sage experience the short process guides, Or want of skill, or want of care presides. Whoe'er would form it on the surest plan, To rear the child and long sustain the man; To shield the morals while it mends the size, And all the powers of every food supplies, Attend the lesson that the muse shall bring. Suspend your spoons, and listen while I sing. But since, O man! thy life and health demand Not food alone, but labor from thy hand, First in the field, beneath the sun's strong rays, Ask of thy mother earth the needful maize; She loves the race that courts her yielding soil, And gives her bounties to the sons of toil. When now the ox, obedient to thy call, Repays the loan that fill'd the winter stall, Pursue his traces o'er the furrow'd plain, And plant in measured hills the golden grain. But when the tender germ begins to shoot, And the green spire declares the sprouting root, Then guard your nursling from each greedy foe, The insidious worm, the all-devouring crow. A little ashes, sprinkled round the spire, Soon steep'd in rain, will bid the worm retire; The feather'd robber with his hungry maw Swift flies the field before your man of straw, A frightful image, such as schoolboys bring, When met to burn the pope, or hang the king. Thrice in the season, through each verdant row Wield the strong ploughshare and the faithful hoe; The faithful hoe, a double task that takes, To till the summer corn, and roast the winter cakes. Slow springs the blade, while check'd by chilling rains, Ere yet the sun the seat of Cancer gains; But when his fiercest fires emblaze the land, Then start the juices, then the roots expand; Then, like a column of Corinthian mould, The stalk struts upward and the leaves unfold; The busy branches all the ridges fill, Entwine their arms, and kiss from hill to hill. Here cease to vex them, all your cares are done: Leave the last labors to the parent sun; Beneath his genial smiles, the well-drest field, When autumn calls, a plenteous crop shall yield. Now the strong foliage bears the standards high, And shoots the tall top-gallants to the sky; The suckling ears the silky fringes bend, And pregnant grown, their swelling coats distend; The loaded stalk, while still the burthen grows, O'erhangs the space that runs between the rows: High as a hop-field waves the silent grove, A safe retreat for little thefts of love, When the pledged roasting-ears invite the maid, To meet her swain beneath the new-form'd shade: His generous hand unloads the cumbrous hill, And the green spoils her ready basket fill; Small compensation for the two-fold bliss, The promised wedding, and the present kiss. Slight depredations these; but now the moon Calls from his hollow trees the sly raccoon; And while by night he bears his prize away, The bolder squirrel labors through the day. Both thieves alike, but provident of time, A virtue rare, that almost hides their crime. Then let them steal the little stores they can, And fill their gran'ries from the toils of man; We 've one advantage, where they take no part,— With all their wiles they ne'er have found the art To boil the Hasty-Pudding; here we shine Superior far to tenants of the pine; This envied boon to man shall still belong, Unshared by them, in substance or in song. At last the closing season browns the plain, And ripe October gathers in the grain; Deep loaded carts the spacious corn-house fill, The sack distended marches to the mill; The lab'ring mill beneath the burthen groans, And showers the future pudding from the stones; Till the glad housewife greets the powder'd gold, And the new crop exterminates the old. CANTO III. The days grow short; but though the falling sun To the glad swain proclaims his day's work done, Night's pleasing shades his various tasks prolong, And yield new subject to my various song. For now, the corn-house fill'd, the harvest home, The invited neighbors to the husking come; A frolic scene, where work, and mirth, and play, Unite their charms, to chase the hours away. Where the huge heap lies centred in the hall, The lamp suspended from the cheerful wall, Brown corn-fed nymphs, and strong hard-handed beaus, Alternate ranged, extend in circling rows, Assume their seats, the solid mass attack; The dry husks rustle, and the corn-cobs crack; The song, the laugh, alternate notes resound, And the sweet cider trips in silence round. The laws of husking every wight can tell; And sure no laws he ever keeps so well: For each red ear a general kiss he gains, With each smut ear he smuts the luckless swains; But when to some sweet maid a prize is cast, Red as her lips, and taper as her waist, She walks the round, and culls one favored beau, Who leaps, the luscious tribute to bestow. Various the sport, as are the wits and brains Of well pleased lasses and contending swains; Till the vast mound of corn is swept away, And he that gets the last ear wins the day. Meanwhile the housewife urges all her care, The well-earn'd feast to hasten and prepare. The sifted meal already waits her hand, The milk is strain'd, the bowls in order stand, The fire flames high; and, as a pool (that takes The headlong stream that o'er the mill-dam breaks) Foams, roars, and rages, with incessant toils, So the vex'd cauldron rages, roars and boils. First with clean salt, she seasons well the food, Then strews the flour, and thickens all the flood. Long o'er the simmering fire she lets it stand; To stir it well demands a stronger hand; The husband takes his turn: and round and round The ladle flies; at last the toil is crown'd; When to the board the thronging huskers pour, And take their seats as at the corn before. I leave them to their feast. There still belong More copious matters to my faithful song. For rules there are, though ne'er unfolded yet, Nice rules and wise, how pudding should be ate. Some with molasses line the luscious treat, And mix, like bards, the useful with the sweet. A wholesome dish, and well deserving praise, A great resource in those bleak wintry days, When the chill'd earth lies buried deep in snow, And raging Boreas dries the shivering cow. Blest cow! thy praise shall still my notes employ, Great source of health, the only source of joy; Mother of Egypt's god,—but sure, for me, Were I to leave my God, I 'd worship thee. How oft thy teats these precious hands have press'd! How oft thy bounties prove my only feast! How oft I 've fed thee with my favorite grain! And roar'd, like thee, to find thy children slain! Yes, swains who know her various worth to prize, Ah! house her well from winter's angry skies. Potatoes, pumpkins, should her sadness cheer, Corn from your crib, and mashes from your beer; When spring returns, she 'll well acquit the loan, And nurse at once your infants and her own. Milk then with pudding I would always choose; To this in future I confine my muse, Till she in haste some further hints unfold, Well for the young, nor useless to the old. First in your bowl the milk abundant take, Then drop with care along the silver lake Your flakes of pudding; these at first will hide Their little bulk beneath the swelling tide; But when their growing mass no more can sink, When the soft island looms above the brink, Then check your hand; you 've got the portion due, So taught our sires, and what they taught is true. There is a choice in spoons. Though small appear The nice distinction, yet to me 't is clear. The deep bowl'd Gallic spoon, contrived to scoop In ample draughts the thin diluted soup, Performs not well in those substantial things, Whose mass adhesive to the metal clings; Where the strong labial muscles must embrace, The gentle curve, and sweep the hollow space. With ease to enter and discharge the freight, A bowl less concave but still more dilate, Becomes the pudding best. The shape, the size, A secret rests, unknown to vulgar eyes. Experienced feeders can alone impart A rule so much above the lore of art. These tuneful lips, that thousand spoons have tried, With just precision could the point decide, Though not in song; the muse but poorly shines In cones, and cubes, and geometric lines: Yet the true form, as near as she can tell, Is that small section of a goose egg shell, Which in two equal portions shall divide The distance from the centre to the side. Fear not to slaver; 'tis no deadly sin:— Like the free Frenchman, from your joyous chin Suspend the ready napkin; or like me, Poise with one hand your bowl upon your knee; Just in the zenith your wise head project, Your full spoon, rising in a line direct, Bold as a bucket, heeds no drops that fall, The wide mouth'd bowl will surely catch them all! FROM THE VISION OF COLUMBUS. Where Spring's coy steps, in cold Canadia stray, And joyless seasons hold unequal sway; He saw the pine its daring mantle rear, Break the rude blast, and mock the inclement year, Secure the limits of the angry skies, And bid all southern vegetation rise. Wild o'er the vast impenetrable round, The untrod bowers of shadowy nature frown'd; The neighboring cedar waved its honors wide, The fir's tall boughs, the oak's resistless pride, The branching beech, the aspin's trembling shade, Veil'd the dim heavens and brown'd the dusky glade. Here in huge crowds those sturdy sons of earth, In frosty regions, claim a nobler birth; Where heavy trunks the sheltering dome requires, And copious fuel feeds the wintry fires. While warmer suns, that southern climes emblaze, A cool deep umbrage o'er the woodland raise; Floridia's blooming shores around him spread, And Georgian hills erect their shady head; Beneath tall trees, in livelier verdure gay, Long level walks a humble garb display; The infant corn, unconscious of its worth, Points the green spire and bends the foliage forth; Sweeten'd on flowery banks, the passing air Breathes all the untasted fragrance of the year; Unbidden harvests o'er the regions rise, And blooming life repays the genial skies. Where circling shores around the gulf extend, The bounteous groves with richer burdens bend; Spontaneous fruits the uplifted palms unfold, The beauteous orange waves a load of gold, The untaught vine, the wildly-wanton cane Bloom on the waste, and clothe the enarbor'd plain, The rich pimento scents the neighboring skies, And woolly clusters o'er the cotton rise. Here, in one view, the same glad branches bring The fruits of autumn and the flowers of spring; No wintry blasts the unchanging year deform, Nor beasts unshelter'd fear the pinching storm: But vernal breezes o'er the blossoms rove, And breathe the ripen'd juices through the grove. Beneath the crystal wave's inconstant light, Pearls undistinguish'd sparkle on the sight; From opening earth, in living lustre, shine The various treasures of the blazing mine; Hills, cleft before him, all their stores unfold, The quick mercurius and the burning gold; Gems of unnumber'd hues, in bright array, Illume the changing rocks and shed the beams of day. EMBASSY OF ROCHA. FROM THE COLUMBIAD. Soon the glad prince, in robes of white array'd, Call'd his attendants, and the sire obey'd; A diamond broad, in burning gold imprest, Display'd the sun's bright image on his breast; A pearl-dropt girdle bound his waist below, And the white lautu graced his lofty brow. They journey'd forth, o'ermarching far the mound That flank'd the kingdom on its Andean bound; Ridge after ridge through vagrant hordes they pass'd, Where each new tribe seem'd wilder than the last; To all they preach and prove the solar sway And climb fresh mountains on their tedious way. At length, as through disparting clouds they rise, And hills above them still obstruct the skies, While a dead calm o'er all the region stood And not a leaf could fan its parent wood, Sudden a strange portentous noise began; The birds fled wild, the beasts for shelter ran; Slow, sullen, loud, with deep astounding blare, Swell the strong tones of subterranean war; Behind, before, beneath them groans the ground, Earth heaves and labors with the shuddering sound; Columns of smoke, that cap the rumbling height, Roll reddening far through heaven and choke the light; From tottering steeps descend their cliffs of snow, The mountains reel, the valleys rend below; The headlong streams forget their usual round And shrink and vanish in the gaping ground. The sun descends; but night recalls in vain Her silent shades, to recommence her reign; The bursting mount gapes high, a sudden glare Corruscates wide, till all the purpling air Breaks into flame; it wheels and roars and raves And wraps the welkin in its folding waves. Light sailing cinders, through its vortex driven, Stream high and brighten to the midst of heaven; And, following slow, full floods of boiling ore Swell, swoop aloft, and through the concave roar. Torrents of molten rocks, on every side, Lead o'er the shelves of ice their fiery tide; Hills slide before them, skies around them burn, Towns sink beneath and heaving plains upturn; O'er many a league the flaming deluge hurl'd, Sweeps total nations from the staggering world. Meanwhile, at distance through the livid light, A busy concourse met their wondering sight; The prince drew near; where lo! an altar stood, Rude in its form and fill'd with burning wood; Wrapt in the flames a child expiring lay And the fond father thus was heard to pray: “Receive, O dreadful power, from feeble age This last pure offering to thy sateless rage; Thrice has thy vengeance on this hated land Claim'd a dear infant from my yielding hand, Thrice have those lovely lips the victim press'd, And all the mother torn that tender breast, When the dread duty stifled every sigh And not a tear escaped her beauteous eye. Our fourth and last now meets the fatal doom; Groan not, my child, thy god remands thee home; Attend once more, thou dark infernal name, From yon far streaming pyramid of flame; Snatch from his heaving flesh the blasted breath, Sacred to thee and all the fiends of death; Then in thy hall, with spoils of nations crown'd, Confine thy walks beneath the rending ground; No more on earth the embowell'd flames to pour, And scourge my people and my race no more.” Thus Rocha heard; and to the trembling crowd Turn'd the bright image of his beaming god. The afflicted chief, with fear and grief oppress'd, Beheld the sign, and thus the prince address'd: “From what far land, O royal stranger, say, Ascend thy wandering steps this nightly way? From plains like ours, by holy demons fired? Have thy brave people in the flames expired? And hast thou now, to stay the whelming flood, No son to offer to the furious god?” “From happier lands I came,” the prince returns, “Where no red flaming flood the concave burns, No furious god bestorms our soil and skies, Nor yield our hands the bloody sacrifice; But life and joy the Power delights to give, And bids his children but rejoice and live. Thou seest through heaven the day-dispensing Sun In living radiance wheel his golden throne, O'er earth's gay surface send his genial beams, Force from yon cliffs of ice the vernal streams; While fruits and flowers adorn the cultured field, And seas and lakes their copious treasures yield: He reigns our only god. In him we trace The friend, the father of our happy race. Late the lone tribes, on those unlabor'd shores, Ran wild, and served imaginary powers; Till he in pity taught their feuds to cease, Devised their laws and fashion'd all for peace. My sacred parents first the reign began, Sent from his courts to guide the paths of man, To plant his fruits, to manifest his sway, And give their blessings where he gives the day.” The legates now their further course descried, A young cazique attending as a guide, O'er craggy cliffs pursued their eastern way, Trod loftier champaigns, meeting high the day: Saw timorous tribes in these sublime abodes Adore the blasts and turn the storms to gods; While every cloud that thunders through the skies Claims from their hands a human sacrifice. Awhile the youth, their better faith to gain, Strives with his usual art, but strives in vain; In vain he pleads the mildness of the sun; A gale refutes him ere his speech be done; Continual tempests from their orient blow, And load the mountains with eternal snow. The sun's own beam, the timid clans declare, Drives all their evils on the tortured air; He draws the vapors up their eastern sky, That sail and centre round his dazzling eye; Leads the loud storms along his mid-day course And bids the Andes meet their sweeping force, Builds their bleak summits with an icy throne, To shine through heaven, a semblance of his own; Hence the sharp sleet these lifted lawns that wait, And all the scourges that attend their state. Two toilsome days the virtuous Inca strove To social life their savage minds to move; When the third morning glow'd serenely bright, He led their elders to an eastern height; The world unlimited beneath them lay, And not a cloud obscured the rising day. Vast Amazonia, starr'd with twinkling streams, In azure drest, a heaven inverted seems; Dim Paraguay extends the aching sight, Xaraya glimmers like the moon of night, Land, water, sky, in blending borders play And smile and brighten to the lamp of day. When thus the prince: What majesty divine! What robes of gold! what flames about him shine! There walks the god; his starry sons on high Draw their dim veil and shrink behind the sky; Earth with surrounding nature 's born anew, And men by millions greet the glorious view. Who can behold his all delighting soul Give life and joy, and heaven and earth control, Bid death and darkness from his presence move, Who can behold and not adore and love? Those plains, immensely circling, feel his beams, He greens the groves, he silvers gay the streams, Swells the wild fruitage, gives the beast his food, And mute creation hails the genial god. But richer boons his righteous laws impart, To aid the life and mould the social heart, His arts of peace through happy realms to spread, And altars grace with sacrificial bread; Such our distinguish'd lot, who own his sway, Mild as his morning stars and liberal as the day. His unknown laws, the mountain chief replied, May serve perchance your boasted race to guide: And yon low plains, that drink his partial ray, At his glad shrine their just devotions pay. But we nor fear his frown nor trust his smile; Vain as our prayers is every anxious toil; Our beasts are buried in his whirls of snow, Our cabins drifted to his slaves below. Even now his placid looks thy hopes beguile, He lures thy raptures with a morning smile; But soon (for so those saffron robes proclaim) His own black tempest shall obstruct his flame, Storm, thunder, fire against the mountains driven, Rake deep their sulphur'd sides, disgorging here his heaven. He spoke; they waited, till the fervid ray High from the noontide shot the faithless day; When lo, far gathering under eastern skies, Solemn and slow, the dark red vapors rise; Full clouds, convolving on the turbid air, Move like an ocean to the watry war. The host, securely raised, no dangers harm, They sit unclouded and o'erlook the storm; While far beneath, the sky-borne waters ride, Veil the dark deep and sheet the mountain's side; The lightning's glancing fires in fury curl'd Bend their long forky foldings o'er the world; Torrents and broken crags and floods of rain From steep to steep roll down their force amain In dreadful cataracts; the bolts confound The tumbling clouds, and rock the solid ground. The blasts unburden'd take their upward course, And o'er the mountain top resume their force. Swift through the long white ridges from the north, The rapid whirlwinds lead their terrors forth; High walks the storm, the circling surges rise, And wild gyrations wheel the hovering skies; Vast hills of snow, in sweeping columns driven, Deluge the air and choke the void of heaven; Floods burst their bounds, the rocks forget their place, And the firm Andes tremble to their base. Long gazed the host; when thus the stubborn chief, With eyes on fire, and fill'd with sullen grief: Behold thy careless god, secure on high, Laughs at our woes and peaceful walks the sky, Drives all his evils on these seats sublime, And wafts his favors to a happier clime; Sire of the dastard race, thy words disclose, There glads his children, here afflicts his foes. Hence! speed thy flight! pursue him where he leads, Lest vengeance seize thee for thy father's deeds, Thy immolated limbs assuage the fire Of those curst powers, who now a gift require. The youth in haste collects his scanty train And with the sun flies o'er the western plain; The fading orb with plaintive voice he plies, To guide his steps and light him down the skies. So when the moon and all the host of even Hang pale and trembling on the verge of heaven, While storms ascending threat their nightly reign, They seek their absent sire and sink below the main. GEORGE RICHARDS THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE. The daring muse with retrospective eye, Throws back her glance, to that immortal day, When millions sworn to conquer or to die, Roused as a lion panting for the prey, And rushing headlong to the field of war, Rode, vengeful rode, on slaughter's gore-besprinkled car. Why burnt thus fierce within the frenzied soul, Undying freedom's life-enkindled flame? Who led the lightning? bade the thunder roll? What godlike power? what deathless son of fame, Rent the dark veil of ancient days in twain, And gave to independence, liberty's loosed rein? Say, can'st thou count the sum of untold wrong, Which fired to rage this last discover'd world, To high wrought valor drove the impassion'd throng, And the hot bolt of tricene vengeance hurl'd, At the proud puppets of a venal throne, Whom eastern lust of haughtiest rule had blush'd to own? As well, might gaze intense on you gemm'd spheres, Bring to one point of view the stars of heaven;— As soon, the dew drops, nature's pearly tears, Or autumn's leaves by rapid whirlwinds driven, Shall be wrote down on registers of time, As art numeric, number more than countless crime. Heard ye that sigh? it is the sigh of law, The grand palladium of terrestrial right; Lies crush'd by despotism's Typhæan paw, And justice sinks to realms of brooding night: Juries are driven before the rising storm, And king-paid judges, judgment's gold-ruled bench deform. Are there no Hampdens, Pyms who dare to rise No Marvels who abhor the Danaen shower? Yes! Roman patriots crowd these western skies, Nor heed the scorpion lash of Nimrod power: Temperate, yet firm, they poise the dubious scales— But private vice, awhile, o'er public good prevails. The mild petition, bold remonstrance fail; Infuriate demons, lust of power and gold, (Whose cheeks ne'er turn'd at human misery pale) The reins of government triumphant hold: New deeds of wrong, and acts first penn'd in blood, Howl, as wild furies, o'er the Atlantic flood. Spirit of Wolfe! and ghost of gallant Howe: Was it for this, Columbia's yeomen bled, When 'mid the vale, or on the mountain's brow, Your arms to death, or crest-plumed victory led, A bold, intrepid, hardy, rustic train, Whose life, with elder Albion's, dyed the reeking plain. Lo, 'mid the bowers of sweet, domestic peace, Intrusive treads the son of hated war: Whilst harpies sworn, a bleeding land to fleece, The merchant trap in iron nets of law: Trade dies away—and commerce quits the shore, Where right to hard earn'd property, is known no more. See, ravage mark a desolated coast.— Old ocean groans beneath the sharks of power.— In panoply of steel, a Gorgon host, Snuff blood afar—and wait the opening hour, Which hurl'd on Lexington the volleyed storm, And onward pour'd, in vengeance, life-demanding form. Behold! that curling flame which mounts in air, 'T is Charlestown, rolling flagrant to the skies: How deep those groans of agony, despair! What piercing screams in wild discordance rise! These run, those fly, t' avoid encircling fire, Give one fond look at home, fall down, convulse, expire. Cry not the ghosts of gallant freemen slain, How long! how long! ere vengeance strikes the blow? The dust of Charlestown flitting o'er the plain, All eloquent, accuses loud the foe. Heavens! shall their union'd voice a boon demand, And rouse not into agonies a madd'ning land? Black in the south, grim Afria's soot-steep'd race, Lift at a master's throat the sharp edged knife. Red in the north, the biped of the chase, Quaffs from embowell'd captives streaming life; Whilst fierce Areskoui, frantic, fires his soul, And raging, stamps to atoms, mercy's wine fill'd bowl. All ages, sexes, ranks are doom'd the prey, Of loosen'd havock's cannibalian hounds: Cities and villas melt in flame away: And foul dishonor tramples virgin mounds: The son, the sire, the husband, wife are kill'd: And Abel's righteous blood, by Cain's rude hand, is spill'd. Eternal Judge of everlasting right! Shall thine own image bend beneath the stroke? Forbid it earth! forbid it worlds of light! Oh nerve the arm, as nature nerves the oak, Which, whilst the sounding axe repeats the blow, Acquires new strength, and scorns the idly threatening foe. 'T is done! the councils of the sky decree, That ancient compacts shall for ever cease: The trump of heaven, it hails Columbia, free: As enemies, in war; as friends, in peace, America, henceforth, Britannia eyes: The last appeal is lodged; it thunders to the skies. Strong, in reliance on the power divine, United Delegates impress the seal:— Heroes and statesmen, hail! Your names shall shine On glory's page, when heaven, earth, ocean, feel, Those chymic fires which purge the dross away, And leave creation's gold impassive of decay. Shall not the muse, record each patriot name, On the rich tablet of harmonic sound? Glows not the goddess of immortal fame, To waft their praises, wide, the world around? Yes! poesy and fame enraptured join, Inspire the beating heart, and swell the emphatic line. MERCY WARREN. SIMPLICITY. Deep in the bosom of old Time there stood, Just on the margin of the sea-green flood, A virgin form, in lucid robes array'd, Whose ebon tresses negligently play'd In flowing ringlets, as the wavy main Felt the soft breeze that fann'd the verdant plain; While the young blush of innocence bespoke Her innate worth in every graceful look; Her meek-eyed aspect, modest and benign, Evinced the fair one's origin divine; Virtue, at once her ornament and shield, And truth the trident that the goddess held. Beneath her reign, behold a happy race, Who ne'er contested titles, gold, or place. Ere commerce's whiten'd sails were wafted wide, And every bosom caught the swelling pride Of boundless wealth, surcharged with endless snares, Exotic follies, and destructive cares; Ere arts, or elegance, or taste refined, And tempting luxury assail'd mankind; There oaks and evergreens, and poplar shades, In native beauty, rear'd their conic heads; The purple tinge with golden hues inwrought, In dappled forms, as sportive nature taught; The silken foliage open'd through the mead, And the clear fount in wild meanders play'd; Beside whose gentle murmuring stream there stood The humble hamlet, by the peasant trod, Whose heart, unblacken'd by so mean a vice, As lust of gold, or carking avarice; No guilty bribes his whiten'd palm possess'd, No dark suspicion lurk'd within his breast: Love, concord, peace, and piety and truth, Adorn'd grey hairs and dignified the youth; There stingless pleasures crown'd the temperate feast, And ruddy health, a constant welcome guest, Fill'd up the cup, and smiled at every board, The friend and handmaid of her generous lord. The rosy finger'd morn, and noontide ray, The streaked twilight or the evening gray, Were pass'd alike in innocence and mirth, No riot gendering slow but certain death; Unclouded reason guided all their way, And virtue's self sat innocently gay. The winged hours serenely glided by, Till golden Phœbus deck'd the western sky; And when enwrapp'd in evening's sable vest, And midnight shadows hush'd the world to rest, On the famed ladder, whose extended bars, From earth's low surface reach'd beyond the stars, From orb to orb, thought reach'd the airy void, Through widen'd space the busy mind employ'd, While angel guards to watch his fate were given Prelusive dreams anticipated heaven. But ere the bird of dawn had hail'd the day, Or warbling songsters chirp'd their early lay, The grateful heart its joyful matins raised, And nature's God in morning anthems praised. Thus happy that ideal golden age, That lives descriptive in the poet's page; But now, alas! in dark oblivion lost, The sons of Adam know it to their cost; Since God forbade the mother of mankind To taste the fruit to which she most inclined: Her taste so delicate, refined and nice, That the exuberance even of Paradise, The grassy banks beside the blue cascade, The winding streams from Pison's golden head. The spicy groves on Gihon's lengthen'd side, Hiddekel's fount, Assyria's blooming pride, The fruits luxuriant on Euphrates' shores, The rich profusion that all Eden pours, The shady dome, the rosy vaulted bower, And nature deck'd with every fruit and flower Were insufficient, rude, and incomplete. For taste ran wanton, and the fair must eat. Since which the garden's closely lock'd by fate, And flaming cherubs guard the eastern gate; This globe is traversed round from pole to pole, And earth research'd to find so rich a dole As happiness unmix'd:—the phantom flies, No son of Eve has ever won the prize. But nearest those, who nearest nature live, Despising all that wealth or power can give, Or glittering grandeur, whose false optics place, The summum bonum on the frailest base; And if too near the threshold of their door, Pride blazes high, and clamors loud for more— More shining pomp, more elegance and zest, In all the wild variety of taste; Peace and contentment are refined away, And worth, unblemish'd, is the villain's prey. Easy the toil, and simple is the task, That yields to man all nature bids him ask; And each improvement on the author's plan, Adds new inquietudes to restless man. As from simplicity he deviates, Fancy, prolific, endless wants creates; Creates new wishes, foreign to the soul, Ten thousand passions all the mind control, So fast they tread behind each other's heels, That some new image on the fancy steals; Ere the young embryo half its form completes, Some new vagary the old plan defeats; Down comes the Gothic or Corinthian pile, And the new vista wears the Doric style. The finer arts depopulate and waste, And nations sink by elegance and taste: Empires are from their lofty summits rent, And kingdoms down to swift perdition sent, By soft, corrupt refinements of the heart, Wrought up to vice by each deceptive art. Rome, the proud mistress of the world, displays A lasting proof of what my pen essays; High-wrought refinement—usher'd in replete, With all the ills that sink a virtuous state; Their sumptuary laws grown obsolete, They, undismay'd, the patriot's frown could meet; Their simple manners lost—their censors dead, Spruce petit maitres o'er the forum tread. I weep those days when gentle Maro sung, And sweetest strains bedeck'd the flatterer's tongue; When so corrupt and so refined the times, The muse could stoop to gild a tyrant's crimes. Then paint and sculpture, elegance and song, Were the pursuits of all the busy throng; When silken commerce held the golden scales, Empire was purchased at the public sales: No longer lived the ancient Roman pride, Her virtue sicken'd, and her glory died. What blotted out the Carthaginian fame, And left no traces but an empty name?— Commerce! the source of every narrow vice, And honor, barter'd at a trivial price. By court intrigues, the Commonwealth 's disgraced, Both suffetes, and senators debased: By soft refinement, and the love of gold, Faction and strife grew emulous and bold, Till restless Hanno urged his purpose on, And Scipio's rival by his arts undone. From age to age since Hannibal's hard fate, From Cæsar's annals to the modern date, When Brunswick's race sits on the British throne, And George's folly stains his grandsire's crown; When taste improved by luxury high wrought, And fancy craves what nature never taught; Affronted virtue mounts her native skies, And freedom's genius lifts her bloated eyes; As late I saw, in sable vestments stand, The weeping fair, on Britain's naked strand. The cloud-capt hills, the echoing woods and dales, (Where pious Druids dress'd the hallow'd vales; And wrote their missals on the birchen rind, And chanted dirges with the hollow wind,) Breathe murmuring sighs o'er that ill fated isle, Wrapt in refinements both absurd and vile. Proud Thames deserted—her commercial ports Seized and possess'd by hated foreign courts; No more the lofty ships her marts supply, The Neriads flap their watery wings and die: Gray Neptune rises from his oozy bed, And shakes the sea-weed from his shaggy head; He bids adieu to fair Britannia's shore, The surge rebounds, and all the woodlands roar; His course he bends toward the western main, The frowning Titans join the swelling train, Measure the deep, and lash the foaming sea, In haste to hail the brave Columbia free: Ocean rebounds, and earth reverberates, And heaven confirms the independent states; While time rolls on, and mighty kingdoms fail, They, peace and freedom on their heirs entail, Till virtue sinks, and in far distant times, Dies in the vortex of European crimes. THOMAS DAWES THE LAW GIVEN AT SINAI. Through heaven's high courts the trump eternal roars— Lift up your heads ye everlasting doors; And wait the God of gods!—Lo, at the sound, Wide fly the portals, blazing all around. And see he comes! adown the rending skies, Borne on the whirlwind's rapid wing he flies, Cherub and seraphim prepare his way, Black thunder rolls and livid lightnings play. Heaven's radiant bow his awful head arrays, His face the sun's refulgent beam displays; Beneath his feet the avenging bolts are hurl'd, The avenging bolts that shake a guilty world.— Sounds but his dread command, when down they fly, The deep-mouth'd thunder rends the vaulted sky; All nature trembles as they issue down, Deep groans the earth, her utmost regions groan. And lo, on Sinai's top descends the God, That wrapt in tempest, trembled as he trod. Flame, smoke, and whirlwind clothe its awful brow, While earthquake heaves the groaning base below. Tremendous scene, oh how shall men withstand, When God in thunder gives the world command! And hark! the trumpet's intermitted sound Roars from the mount and shakes all nature round. “I am the King of Kings, the Lord of all, At whose dread shrine even Gods in honor fall: By whom creation rose, divinely fair, Who form'd the stars, and launch'd them in the air: Whose mighty nod the rough tumultuous sea, The whirlwind's sweep, and rending bolt obey. I speak—and lo ten thousand thunders roll— I breathe—and lightning gleams from pole to pole. The Almighty is my name—at my command Thick darkness rose that veil'd the Memphian land. Empower'd by me, your leader smote the main, And call'd up plagues that poison'd all their plain; That e'en the earth and air, which gave them birth, Conspired and smote them with enormous death.— I spake the word, asunder Jordan rode, That Israel o'er its dry foundations trod.— Egypt pursued, I bade the same dread wave Roll back, and whelm their millions in a grave. 'Twas said—the raging elements combined, The rushing tempest and the warring wind; Till own'd too late a God's superior power, They sunk in depths, and sunk to rise no more! Still would ye have the assistance of that God Continued through a life's perplexing road; That when at last the heavens and earth expire, And nature rolls in one devouring fire, Ye might in transport view the advancing hour, In transport hear the last dread thunders roar; Then like the day emerging from the gloom, Arise to flourish in eternal bloom— With due respect, with holy awe receive Those institutions which your God will give!— For this he trod the unhallow'd realms below, In all the pomp the powers of heaven could show. Thus spake the Legislator of the sky— And earth's long shores return the loud reply. Peal push'd on peal, the doubling thunders roar, Bellow the winds—the flamy lightnings glare.— Such shall the scene be at that dreadful time, When the last trump shall sound his wrath sublime: That potent trump which every head shall call From each dark chamber of the bursting ball. Then at the flames which in his nostrils glow, The everlasting hills in streams shall flow— The affrighted sun shall from yon arch retire, Shook from his sphere, and help the general fire.— Yon moon in blood! then every star shall fall, In rude combustion o'er a flaming ball: Creation sunk, and all God's thunder hurl'd Down on the wrecks of each expiring world. But where 's the muse?—behold the Almighty rise: The whirlwind bears him up the flaming skies. Follow harmonious all the tuneful choir, Sweet concert sweeping from the swelling lyre. Such notes as at creation's birth they sung, When heaven's broad arch with hallelujahs rung. Hark—at the strain the enraptured spheres rebound; And laboring echo lengthens out the sound. “Lift up your heads, celestial gates!” they sing: And see—they open to receive the king. The expecting host their loudest accents raise— “Eternal God, how glorious are thy ways! O for some great, some more than angel song, To speak the praises which to thee belong! Imagination faints on this great scene; Thought is too low, and majesty too mean: So great thy condescension thus to own Vile man, the meanest prostrate at thy throne May from his grateful altar ever rise A glad perfume of incense to the skies.” RICHARD DEVENS [Paraphrase of Job] Whose art, where human foot ne'er access found, Adorns, in wild diversity, the ground? Makes lonely walks to bloom confusedly gay, And with rich fragrance to perfume the day? Through all her lately flourishing increase, When vegetation droops, canst thou release From wasting drought the summer? Will the rain Rush at thy bidding, down in floods amain? When the black clouds th' impetuous torrent pour, Canst thou in middle-deluge stop the shower? Whose thunder, when fierce flames the welkin wrap, Stuns nature's ear with the tremendous clap? Didst thou the rainbow fix? its hues impart— Those hues that distance the exploits of art? Who generates the hoary frost? and who Bespangles morning with his orient dew? Hath mist a sire? canst thou congeal the main? From whom descend the pearly streams of rain? Dost thou ordain the seasons of the year? And govern all the changes of the air? Who gives the live-green earth its vernal hue? Dost thou the odor of the fields renew? Ripen the harvest? drive the eastern blast? And lay the opulence of autumn waste? Give meads with yellow pomp to cheer the sight? Or deck in majesty of winter's white? By whom instructed do the planets know, Where orient or meridian beams must glow? Who taught Arcturus, round the northern pole, His destined circuit with his suns to roll? Or Mazaroth to wind athwart the night, In his appointed hours, his length of light? When th' early Pleiades benignly gleam, Canst thou in bands of crystal bind the stream? The beauties of th' enamell'd spring withhold, And blast the foliage with autumnal cold? Oppress'd by Sirius, when the fields complain, His unpropitious influence restrain? With vernal showers the parching wind allay, And chase the fervor of th' inclement day? Or when Orion glares upon thy view, Make earth to bloom and vegetate anew? Breathes the minutest rover of the air, Held by thy power, or nourish'd by thy care? Who feeds the ravens, when the croaking brood Raise hoarsely querulous their plaint to God? Didst thou the ostrich clothe with plumes so neat, Who leaves her eggs exposed to heedless feet? Hatch'd by the genial influence of the sun, Alone, the unfledged brood are left to run. In flight she scorns the rider and his steed; Through eddies of the sand upspurn'd, her speed Impetuously she skims; than winds more fleet; She triumphs in th' alertness of her feet. The peacock view, still exquisitely fair, When clouds forsake, and when invest the air: His gems now brightened by a noontide ray; He proudly waves his feathers to the day. A strut, majestically slow, assumes, And glories in the beauty of his plumes. The hawk, before autumnal tempests rise, Pursues the summer through the southern skies: Knows she from bleak inclement months to flee, And find perpetual August, taught by thee? Who lifts the eagle on her lofty way, To rove exulting in a cloudless day? On high and craggy cliffs she dwells alone; Their strength remains impregnably her own: With darting haste, behold her ample size, Full to th' enjoy'd, though distant victim hies: Couch'd horrid now she nimbly hovers o'er Her untorn prey, in raptures of its gore. Back to her nest she shapes her upward flight, Her young suck up the blood, with dire delight. SAMUEL DEXTER THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE. Let martial souls, whom wild ambition warms, The trumpet's clangor, and rude din of arms, Point out the path victorious heroes trod, The pest of nations, and the scourge of God: Mine be the task, in humbler verse to trace The real greatness of the human race. Though rude and savage Afric's sons we find, Yet there first science dawn'd upon mankind, There curb'd the passions in perpetual strife, And there begat the softer arts of life. Blest by kind nature with a generous soil, That yielded herbage, though not dress'd with toil, In philosophic ease they pass'd their years, And watch'd the motions of the rolling spheres. Their modest wants plain nature could redress, And science gave them rural happiness. Egypt beheld her twilight's fainter ray, And form'd fond hopes of her meridian day; When, lo! tyrannic rage usurp'd the whole, And cramp'd with fetters each high swelling soul. Disorder'd fancy superstition bred; She clapp'd her wings, and thought her foe was dead; Yet she but fled, to gain in happy Greece, What Egypt had denied her—rural peace. The Grecian souls, form'd of the subtlest kind, In freedom nurtured, strengthen'd and refined, Quick catch'd the flame; it ran from soul to soul, And like electric fire, inspired the whole. Here poets sang, and rhetoricians plead, Here statesmen sat, and patriot worthies bled. Ah blindness to the future! headlong toss'd, They grasp'd the shadow, but the substance lost. Greece led her armies Troy's high walls to raze; The city shook and tottered to its base, At length it fell—but from its ruins rose A vagrant band to subjugate their foes. Imperial Rome, the mistress of the world, Towns, cities, kingdoms into ruin hurl'd, And reign'd supreme alone. Greece felt her force, Nor stemm'd the torrent in its rapid course; All victims fell to its resistless rage, The rough Barbarian, and the Grecian sage. Ardent the Romans Grecian science view'd, Nor scorn'd to learn of those they had subdued; They reach'd the same sublimity of thought, And those, who learned, equall'd those, who taught. There godlike Homer rear'd his awful head, Here Virgil sang, and here great Tully plead. As when some mighty torrent, swoln with rain, Falls rushing, dashing, till it meets the plain, O'er craggy rocks bends its resistless force, From clift to clift loud thundering in its course; So did the Athenian patriotic rave, And taught his country to be nobly brave. Not so the Roman. As the ancient Nile Glides smoothly on within its banks a while: Slow, gradual, rising, then o'erspreads the plain, And adds all Egypt to the swelling main; So syren Tully onward gently rolls, Enchants, enraptures, and subdues our souls. Behold far north the gathering tempest rise, Rushing impetuous, as the whirlwind flies; Towns, cities, kingdoms from their basis fall, And one wide ruin overwhelms them all. Eternal Rome sinks to the common grave, Bursts, like a bubble dancing on the wave, Flies off in smoke, and rules the world no more— Oh! blush then, earthly grandeur! pageant power. Age after age in one sad tenor ran, A blank—a chasm in the page of man. Men drudged their labor'd dulness to rehearse, To form an anagram, or egg in verse; They stifled genius with pedantic rules, And labor'd hard to prove that—they were fools. No mighty task, though labor'd in so long, Each line was proof, was demonstration strong; And men, Oh dulness to perfection brought! Blush'd to be guilty of a noble thought. Yet in this gloom did Roger Bacon rise, Like lightning flashing through the clouded skies, He burst the barrier of pedantic rules, And all the labor'd jargon of the schools. As forked lightnings, with their hasty light, Serve but to show the horrors of the night; So he but show'd the dulness of the age, A stain—a blot upon th' historic page. As when cold Zembla, wrapt in darkest shade, First sees the sun erect his radiant head, In gratitude to the benignant power, They gather round and Persian-like adore; He gives them light, not only light, but heat; Warms with new life, and makes that life complete. The expanding blossoms smile on every clod, And laughing valleys own the present God; Loud hymns of praise the feather'd tribes employ, And savage beasts howl their tremendous joy. ST JOHN HONEYWOOD ON THE PRESIDENT'S FAREWELL ADDRESS. As the rude Zemblian views with anxious eyes The sun fast rolling from his wintry skies, While gathering clouds the shaded vaults deform, And hollow winds announce the impending storm, His anguish'd soul recoils with wild affright, From the dread horrors of the tedious night; Such fears alarm'd—such gloom o'ercast each mind, When Washington his sacred trust resign'd, And open'd to his much loved country's view, The instructive page which bid the long adieu. So erst Nunnides, of prophetic tongue, Chief victor seer, to Judah's listening throng, Gave his last blessings: So long ages since, Mild Solon and the stern Laconian prince, Those boasts of fame, their parting counsels gave, When worn with toil they sought the peaceful grave. Columbians! long preserve that peerless page, Stamp'd with the precepts of your warrior sage; In all your archives be the gift enroll'd, Suspend it to your walls encased with gold; Bid schools recite it, let the priestly train Chant it on festal days, nor deem the task profane: When round your knees your infant offspring throng, To join the matin prayer or evening song, Those rites perform'd, invite them to attend The farewell counsels of their good old friend, And say, he left you, as his last bequest, These golden rules to make a nation blest. O land, thrice blest, if to thy interest wise, Thy senates learn this precious boon to prize: While guilty Europe's blood-stain'd empires fall, While heaven incensed lets loose the infuriate Gaul, Thy states in phalanx firm, a sacred band, Safe from the mighty wreck unmoved shall stand. Behold the man! ye crown'd and ermined train, And learn from him the royal art to reign; No guards surround him, or his walks infest, No cuirass meanly shields his noble breast; His the defence which despots ne'er can find, The love, the prayers, the interest of mankind. Ask ye what spoils his far famed arms have won, What cities sack'd, what hapless realms undone? Though Monmouth's field supports no vulgar fame, Though captured York shall long preserve his name, I quote not these—a nobler scene behold, Wide cultured fields fast ripening into gold! There, as his toil the cheerful peasant plies, New marts are opening, and new spires arise; Here commerce smiles, and there en groupe are seen, The useful arts and those of sprightlier mien: To cheer the whole, the Muses tune their lyre, And Independence leads the white robed choir. Trophies like these, to vulgar minds unknown, Were sought and prized by Washington alone, From these, with all his country's honors crown'd, As sage in councils as in arms renown'd; All of a piece, and faithful to the last, Great in this action as in all the past, He turns—and urges as his last request, Remote from power his weary head to rest. Illustrious man, adieu! yet ere we part, Forgive our factions which have wrung thy heart; Still with indulgent eyes thy country see, Whose ceaseless prayers ascend the heavens for thee: Go, 'midst the shades of tranquil Vernon stray, In vain attempt to shun the piercing ray Of circumambient glory, till refined All that could clog to earth the heaven-lent mind, Then soar triumphant to the blest abodes, And join those chiefs whom virtue raised to gods. ON THE CAPTURE OF ROME BY THE FRENCH. On Rome's devoted head the bolt descends; The proud oppressor's long dominion ends: Spirits of martyrs pure! if aught ye know, In the bright realms of bliss, of things below, Join the glad hymn of triumph, ye who stood Firm for the faith, and seal'd it with your blood. No more shall Rome disturb the world's repose, Quench'd is her torch, and blood no longer flows; Crush'd is the fell destroyer in her turn, And the freed world insults her hated urn. O Truth divine! thou choicest gift of God! Man's guide and solace in this drear abode! Plain was thy garb, and lovely was thy mien, When usher'd by the spotless Nazarene: From shouting crowds and pageantry he fled, To the lone desert or the pauper's shed; There taught his humble followers to despise All that the proud affect, or worldlings prize; Truly he gave to man's repentant race, The peerless treasures of his sovereign grace; Yet bade no fires descend, no thunders roll, To force his bounty on the wayward soul. Join then, celestial Truth, the glad acclaim; Crush'd is the proud usurper of thy name; Who first with blood thy snow-white robes distain'd, And with vain pomp thy holy rites profaned. MODERN ARGUMENTATION. Written extempore, with a pencil, while the author was riding with a friend, whose horse started on passing a tan-yard. 'T was at Commencement tide, so goes the tale, At Harvard, Dartmouth, Princeton, King's, or Yale, A candidate for learning's prime degree Proposed this question to the faculty: “This horse will always from a tan-yard fly, While that, unmoved, a tan-yard passes by; Which is the wiser horse, say, learned sirs, The one that starts, or he that never stirs?” The question thus proposed and understood, Pro more solito, debate ensued. The starting advocates this truth premise: “That of all excellence below the skies, Man is the standard; hence, whene'er we find In beasts or birds strong semblance to mankind, We count it worth, and are well pleased to see In instinct aught that apes humanity. Exempli gratia, who, since time began, E'er hurt the bird that builds her nest with man? If Mrs Airy, though involved in debt, Paid ten bright dollars for a paroquet, And for a monkey six, the cause we know; This talk'd, that flutter'd, like her favorite beau— Yet the same lady loathed the serpent's form, And call'd for hartshorn if she saw a worm: Now to apply this reasoning to our case, We deem him worthiest of the human race Who, at the mention of atrocious deeds, Starts back with horror, and with pity bleeds. But the vile miscreant, whose supreme delight Is placed in havoc and in scenes of fight, Who rudely revels in the house of wo, We hate, and blush that man can sink so low. Why starts the steed whene'er a tan-yard's spied, But that he sees a brother's reeking hide? Here then, they say, a strong resemblance lies, Ergo, the horse that starts is quasi wise.” “Ay, but to man and horse this rule extends, The means must be subservient to the ends. What 's the chief end of horse?—his lord to please, To bear his weight with safety, speed, and ease; 'T is not to start, to heave, to weep, to whine, In notes distracted, Methodist, like thine. Can he be said with safety to convey His lord, who starts and stumbles by the way? Doth he with speed transport his master's weight, Who stops to start at every tanner's gate? And, lastly, where 's the ease?—at every breath The rider fears the horse will prove his death; 'T is plain, the starter deviates from all rule Of right, and when he deviates, is a fool.” Thus, sophists, have your arguments been plied, What now remains but that we should decide? On due consideration, then, we say, “He is the wiser horse who fearless speeds his way.” ROYALL TYLER COUNTRY ODE FOR THE FOURTH OF JULY. Squeak the fife, and beat the drum, Independence day is come!! Let the roasting pig be bled, Quick twist off the cockerel's head, Quickly rub the pewter platter, Heap the nutcakes, fried in butter. Set the cups, and beaker glass, The pumpkin and the apple sauce, Send the keg to shop for brandy; Maple sugar we have handy. Independent, staggering Dick, A noggin mix of swingeing thick, Sal, put on your russet skirt, Jotham, get your boughten shirt, Today we dance to tiddle diddle. —Here comes Sambo with his fiddle; Sambo, take a dram of whiskey, And play up Yankee doodle frisky, Moll, come leave your witched tricks, And let us have a reel of six. Father and mother shall make two; Sal, Moll and I stand all a-row, Sambo, play and dance with quality; This is the day of blest equality. Father and mother are but men, And Sambo—is a citizen. Come foot it, Sal—Moll, figure in, And, mother you dance up to him; Now saw as fast as e'er you can do, And father, you cross o'er to Sambo. —Thus we dance, and thus we play, On glorious Independent day.— Rub more rosin on your bow, And let us have another go. Zounds! as sure as eggs and bacon, Here 's ensign Sneak, and uncle Deacon, Aunt Thiah, and their Bets behind her, On blundering mare, than beetle blinder. And there 's the 'Squire too, with his lady— Sal, hold the beast, I'll take the baby. Moll, bring the 'Squire our great arm chair, Good folks, we 're glad to see you here. Jotham, get the great case bottle, Your teeth can pull its corn-cob stopple. Ensign,—Deacon, never mind; 'Squire, drink until you 're blind. Thus we drink and dance away, This glorious Independent day! MY MISTRESSES. Let Cowley soft in amorous verse The rovings of his love rehearse, With passion most unruly, Boast how he woo'd sweet Amoret, The sobbing Jane, and sprightly Bet, The lily fair and smart brunette, In sweet succession truly. But list, ye lovers, and you'll swear, I roved with him beyond compare, And was far more unlucky. For never yet in Yankee coast Were found such girls, who so could boast, An honest lover's heart to roast, From Casco to Kentucky. When first the girls nicknamed me beau, And I was all for dress and show, I set me out a courting. A romping miss, with heedless art, First caught, then almost broke, my heart. Miss Conduct named; we soon did part, I did not like such sporting. The next coquette, who raised a flame, Was far more grave, and somewhat lame, She in my heart did rankle. She conquer'd, with a sudden glance: The spiteful slut was call'd Miss Chance; I took the gipsy out to dance; She almost broke my ankle. A thoughtless girl, just in her teens, Was the next fair, whom love it seems Had made me prize most highly. I thought to court a lovely mate, But, how it made my heart to ache; It was that jade, the vile Miss Take; In troth, love did it slyly. And last Miss Fortune, whimpering came, Cured me of love's tormenting flame, And all my beau pretences. In widow's weeds, the prude appears; See now—she drowns me with her tears, With bony fist, now slaps my ears, And brings me to my senses. ADDRESS TO DELLA CRUSCA. O Thou, who, with thy blue cerulean blaze, Hast circled Europe's brow with love-lorn praise; Whose magic pen its gelid lightning throws, Is now a sunbeam, now a fragrant rose. Child of the dappled spring, whose green delight, Drinks, with her snow-drop lips, the dewy light. Son of the summer's bland, prolific rays, Who sheds her loftiest treasures in thy lays; Who swells her golden lips to trump thy name, Which sinks to whispers, at thy azure fame. Brown autumn nursed thee with her dulcet dews, And lurid winter rock'd thy cradled muse. Seasons and suns, and spangled systems roll, Like atoms vast, beneath thy cloud-capt soul. Time wings its panting flight in hurried chase, But sinks in dew-dropt languor in the immortal race. O thou, whose soul the nooky Britain scorns; Whose white cliffs tremble, when thy genius storms. The sallow Afric, with her curled domains, And purpled Asia with her muslin plains, And surgy Europe—vain—thy soul confined, Which fills all space—and e'en Matilda's mind! Anna's capacious mind, which all agree, Contain'd a wilderness of words in thee. More happy thou than Macedonia's lord, Who wept for worlds to feed his famish'd sword, Fatigued by attic conquest of the old, Fortune to thee a novel world unfolds. Come, mighty conqueror, thy foes disperse; Let loose thy epithets, those dogs of verse; Draw forth thy gorgeous sword of damask'd rhyme, And ride triumphant through Columbia's clime, Till sober letter'd sense shall dying smile, Before the mighty magic of thy style. What tawny tribes in dusky forest wait, To grace th' ovation of thy victor state. What ochred chiefs, vermilion'd by thy sword, Mark'd by thy epithets, shall own thee lord. The punic Creek, and nigrified Choctaw, The high boned Wabash, and bland hanging Maw; Great little Billy, Piamingo brave, With pity's dew-drops wet M'Gilvery's grave. What sonorous streams meander through thy lays, What lakes shall bless thy rich bequest of praise, Rough Hockhocking, and gentle Chicago, The twin Miamis—placid Scioto. How will Ohio roll his lordly stream, What blue mists dance upon the liquid scene, Gods! how sublime shall Della Crusca rage, When all Niagara cataracts thy page. What arts, what arms, unknown to thee belong? What ruddy scalps shall deck thy sanguined song? What fumy cal'mets scent the ambient air, What love-lorn war-whoops capitals declare. Cerulean tomahawks shall grace each line, And blue-eyed wampum glisten through thy rhyme. Rise, Della Crusca, prince of bards sublime, And pour on us whole cataracts of rhyme. Son of the sun, arise, whose brightest rays, All merge to tapers in thy ignite blaze. Like some colossus, stride the Atlantic o'er, A leg of genius place on either shore, Extend thy red right arm to either world; Be the proud standard of thy style unfurl'd; Proclaim thy sounding page, from shore to shore, And swear that sense in verse, shall be no more. CHOICE OF A WIFE. Fluttering lovers, giddy boys, Sighing soft for Hymen's joys, Would you shun the tricking arts, Beauty's traps for youthful hearts, Would you treasure in a wife, Riches, which shall last through life; Would you in your choice be nice, Hear Minerva's sage advice. Be not caught with shape, nor air, Coral lips, nor flowing hair; Shape and jaunty air may cheat, Coral lips may speak deceit. Girls unmask'd would you descry, Fix your fancy on the eye; Nature there has truth design'd, 'T is the eye, that speaks the mind. Shun the proud, disdainful eye, Frowning fancied dignity, Shun the eye with vacant glare; Cold indifference winters there. Shun the eager orb of fire, Gloating with impure desire; Shun the wily eye of prude, Looking coy to be pursued. From the jilting eye refrain, Glancing love, and now disdain. Fly the fierce, satiric eye, Shooting keen severity; For nature thus, her truth design'd And made the eye proclaim the mind. ON A RUINED HOUSE IN A ROMANTIC COUNTRY. And this rest house is that the which he built, Lamented Jack! and here his malt he piled, Cautious in vain! these rats that squeak so wild, Squeak, not unconscious of their father's guilt. Did ye not see her gleaming through the glade! Belike, 't was she, the maiden all forlorn. What though she milk no cow with crumpled horn, Yet, aye, she haunts the dale where erst she stray'd; And, aye, beside her stalks her amorous knight! Still on his thighs their wonted brogues are worn, And through those brogues, still tatter'd and betorn, His hindward charms gleam an unearthly white; As when through broken clouds at night's high noon Peeps in fair fragments forth the full orb'd harvest moon! THE TOWN ECLOGUE. See, see, bluff winter quits the town, And congees with her surly frown: In her train the beldame carries All sweet fashion's gay vagaries; Her cork-soled shoes, and bonnet rough, Her camel shawl, and bearskin muff, Her beaver gloves and fleecy dress, Red comforter and silk pelisse; And what is worse, the beldame 's stole Of all our bliss the very soul, Has stole the concert, play, and ball; And what is still the worst of all, Has Cooper stole, and with him fled, And left us ?????? in his stead. See the town-bred Spring advancing, Friend to grass, and foe to dancing! See adorn her lovely tresses Cabbage sprouts and water cresses! While for plume, the hoyden lass Sports a bunch of sparrow-grass. See, beneath her market wreath, She smiles her dandelion teeth; Whilst with voice as sweet, or sweeter, Than Billings' strains or Sternhold's metre, With voice which music cannot ape her, Like nightingale or Mrs Draper, She cheers her pannier'd mare and screams Her strawberries and fresh string-beans: Or, whilst her one wheel'd chariot rattles, She bawls her epicurean chattels; Her shelly stores from old Cape Cod, Her mackerel, lobsters, and tom-cod: Or, in her a awning stalls displays, Her tempting lures to hungry gaze; Her luscious stores of fish, fowl, flesh, Her salmon smoked and salmon fresh; Cod's tongues and sounds, and smelt, and eel, Calves' feet and head, and pluck, and veal— Far richer flowers than rural spring From all her scented hoards can bring. For can the rose's gayest dye With salmon soused in beauty vie? Or can the rose's sweetest smell Vie with a fresh caught mackerel? Her rustic coz let others sing, But let me taste the town-bred Spring. Close by her side see ?????? smile, That critic in dumb fish and oil, Who thinks there 's heaven in good dinners, And hell is fill'd with hungry sinners. Close by her side the glutton stands, And takes his snuff, and rubs his hands, With critic nose assays her trash, And licks his lips and pays the cash. RICHARD ALSOP. ECHO NO. I. In order that this piece may be understood, the newspaper paragraph which furnished the occasion for it is here subjoined. “On Tuesday last, about four o'clock, P. M. came on a smart shower of rain, attended with lightning and thunder, no ways remarkable. The clouds soon dissipated, and the appearance of the azure vault, left trivial hopes of further needful supplies from the uncorked bottles of heaven. In a few moments the horizon was again overshadowed, and an almost impenetrable gloom mantled the face of the skies. The wind frequently shifting from one point to another, wafted the clouds in various directions, until at last they united in one common centre and shrouded the visible globe in thick darkness. The attendant lightning, with the accompanying thunder, brought forth from the treasures that embattled elements to awful conflict, were extremely vivid, and amazing loud. Those buildings that were defended by electric rods, appeared to be wrapped in sheets of livid flame, and a flood of the pure fire rolled its burning torrents down them with alarming violence. The majestic roar of disploding thunders, now bursting with a sudden crash, and now wasting the rumbling Echo of their sounds in other lands, added indescribable grandeur to the sublime scene. The windows of the upper regions appeared as thrown wide open, and the trembling cataract poured impetuous down. More salutary showers, and more needed, have not been experienced this summer. Several previous weeks had exhibited a melancholy sight: the verdure of fields was nearly destroyed; and the patient husbandman almost experienced despair. Two beautiful rainbows, the one existing in its native glories, and the other a splendid reflection of primitive colors, closed the magnificent picture, and presented to the contemplative mind, the angel of mercy, clothed with the brilliance of this irradiated arch, and dispensing felicity to assembled worlds. It is not unnatural to expect that the thunder storm would be attended with some damage. We hear a barn belonging to Mr Wythe of Cambridge caught fire from the lightning, which entirely consumed the same, together with several tons of hay, &amp;c.” On Tuesday last great Sol, with piercing eye, Pursued his journey through the vaulted sky, And in his car effulgent roll'd his way Four hours beyond the burning zone of day; When lo! a cloud, o'ershadowing all the plain, From countless pores perspired a liquid rain, While from its cracks the lightnings made a peep, And chit-chat thunders rock'd our fears asleep. But soon the vapory fog dispersed in air, And left the azure blue-eyed concave bare: Even the last drop of hope, which dripping skies Gave for a moment to our straining eyes, Like Boston rum, from heaven's junk bottles broke, Lost all the corks, and vanish'd into smoke. But swift from worlds unknown, a fresh supply Of vapor dimm'd the great horizon's eye; The crazy clouds, by shifting zephyrs driven, Wafted their courses through the high-arch'd heaven, Till piled aloft in one stupendous heap, The seen and unseen worlds grew dark, and nature 'gan to weep. Attendant lightnings stream'd their tails afar, And social thunders waked ethereal war, From dark deep pockets brought their treasured store, Embattled elements increased the roar— Red crinkling fires expended all their force, And tumbling rumblings steer'd their headlong course. Those guarded frames by thunder poles secured, Though wrapp'd in sheets of flame, those sheets endured; O'er their broad roofs the fiery torrents roll'd, And every shingle seem'd of burning gold. Majestic thunders, with disploding roar, And sudden crashing, bounced along the shore, Till, lost in other lands, the whispering sound Fled from our ears and fainted on the ground. Rain's house on high its window sashes oped, And out the cataract impetuous hopp'd, While the grand scene by far more grand appear'd, With lightnings never seen and thunders never heard. More salutary showers have not been known, To wash dame Nature's dirty homespun gown— For several weeks the good old Joan's been seen, With filth bespatter'd like a lazy quean. The husbandman fast travelling to despair, Laid down his hoe and took his rocking chair: While his fat wife, the well and cistern dried, Her mop grown useless, hung it up and cried. Two rainbows fair that Iris brought along, Pick'd from the choicest of her color'd throng; The first born deck'd in pristine hues of light, In all its native glories glowing bright, The next adorn'd with less refulgent rays, But borrowing lustre from its brother's blaze; Shone a bright reflex of those colors gay That deck'd with light creation's primal day, When infant Nature lisp'd her earliest notes, And younker Adam crept in petticoats: And to the people to reflection given, “The sons of Boston, the elect of heaven,” Presented Mercy's angel smiling fair, Irradiate splendors frizzled in his hair, Uncorking demi-johns, and pouring down Heaven's liquid blessings on the gaping town. N. B. At Cambridge town, the selfsame day, A barn was burnt well fill'd with hay. Some say the lightning turn'd it red, Some say the thunder struck it dead, Some say it made the cattle stare, And some it kill'd an aged mare; But we expect the truth to learn, From Mr Wythe, who own'd the barn. VERSES TO THE SHEARWATER—ON THE MORNING AFTER A STORM AT SEA. This piece, we believe, has never before been printed. Whence with morn's first blush of light Com'st thou thus to greet mine eye, Whilst the furious storm of night Hovers yet around the sky? On the fiery tossing wave, Calmly cradled dost thou sleep, When the midnight tempests rave, Lonely wanderer of the deep? Or from some rude isle afar, Castled 'mid the roaring waste, With the beams of morning's star, On lightning pinion dost thou haste? In thy mottled plumage drest, Light thou skimm'st the ocean o'er, Sporting round the breaker's crest Exulting in the tempest's roar. O'er the vast-rolling watry way While our trembling bark is borne, And joyful peers the lamp of day, Lighting up the brow of morn; As through yon cloud its struggling beams Around a partial lustre shed, And mark at fits with golden gleams The mountain billow's surging head; Whilst the long lines of foamy white, At distance o'er the expanse so blue, As domes and castles spiring bright, Commingling, rise on fancy's view— From wave to wave swift skimming light, Now near, and now at distance found, Thy airy form, in ceaseless flight, Cheers the lone dreariness around. Through the vessel's storm-rent sides, When the rushing billows rave; And with fierce gigantic strides, Death terrific walks the wave, Still on hovering pinion near, Thou pursuest thy sportive way; Still uncheck'd by aught of fear, Calmly seek'st thy finny prey. Far from earth's remotest trace, What impels thee thus to roam? What hast thou to mark the place When thou seek'st thy distant home? Without star or magnet's aid, Thou thy faithful course dost keep; Sportive still, still undismay'd, Lonely wanderer of the deep! THE INCANTATION OF ULFO. FROM THE CONQUEST OF SCANDINAVIA. Forth from his camp the dire enchanter stray'd, 'Mid the weird horrors of the midnight shade, Till a lone dell his wandering footsteps found, Fenced with rough cliffs, with mournful cypress crown'd; There stayed his course: with stern, terrific look, Thrice waved on high, his magic wand he shook; And thrice he raised the wild funereal yell, That calls the spirits from th' abyss of hell. When, shrilly answering to the yell afar, Borne on the winds, three female forms appear; Dire as the hag who, 'mid the dreams of night, Pursues the fever'd hectic's trembling flight. With gestures strange, approach the haggard band, And nigh the wizard take their silent stand. Near, in a rock, adown whose rugged side The lonely waters of the desert glide, O'ergrown with brambles, oped an ample cave, Drear as the gloomy mansions of the grave. Within, the screech-owl made her mournful home, And birds obscene that hover round the tomb; Dark, from the moss-grown top, together clung, Ill-omen'd bats, in torpid clusters, hung; And o'er the bottom, with dank leaves bestrow'd, Crept the black adder, and the bloated toad. Thither the magic throng repair'd, to form Their spells obscure, and weave the unhallow'd charm. Muttering dire words, thrice strode the wizard round; Thrice, with his potent wand, he smote the ground; Deep groans ensued; on wings of circling flame, Slow-rising from beneath, a cauldron came; Blue gleam'd the fires amid the shades of night, And o'er the cavern shot a livid light. Now oped a horrid scene: all black with blood, Th' infernal band, prepared for slaughter, stood. Two beauteous babes, by griffons borne away, While lock'd in sleep the hapless mothers lay, Whose smiles the frozen breast to love might warm, And e'en the unsparing wolf to pity charm, The hags unveil'd; and sportive as they play'd, Deep in their hearts embrued the murderous blade; Their dying pangs with smile malignant view'd, And life's last ebbings in the sanguine flood. Now, mix'd with various herbs of magic power, In the dark cauldron glows the purple gore: The night-shade dire, whose baleful branches wave, In glooms of horror o'er the murderer's grave; The manchineel, alluring to the eye, Where, veil'd in beauty, deadliest poisons lie; The far-famed Indian herb, of power to move The foes of nature to unite in love, The serpent race to infant mildness charm, And the fierce tiger of his rage disarm,— Known to the tribes that range the trackless wood Where mad Antonio heaves the headlong flood;— The monster plant that blasts Tartaria's heath; And Upas fatal as the stroke of death: Boil'd the black mass, the associate fiends advance, And round the cauldron form the magic dance. Three times around, in mystic maze they trod, With hideous gesture, and terrific nod; While Runic rhymes, and words that freeze the soul, From their blue lips, in tones of horror, roll. The wizard raised his voice, the cavern round, Wild shuddering, trembled at the fearful sound; In mute attention stood the haggard throng, As thus he woke th' incantatory song. From the dreary realms below, From the dark domains of fear, From the ghastly seats of wo, Hear! tremendous Hela, hear! Dreadful Power! whose awful form Blackens in the midnight storm; Glares athwart the lurid skies, While the sheeted lightning flies; When the thunder awful roars; When the earthquake rocks the shores; Mounted on the wings of air, Thou rulest the elemental war. When famine brings her sickly train; When battle strews the carnaged plain; When pestilence her venom'd wand Waves o'er the desolated land; Rush the ocean's whelming tides O'er the foundering vessel's sides; Then ascends thy voice on high; Then is heard thy funeral cry; Then, in horror, dost thou rise On th' expiring wretch's eyes. From the dreary realms below, From the dark domains of fear, From the ghastly seats of wo, Hear! tremendous Hela, hear! Goddess! whose terrific sway Nastrond's realms of guilt obey; Where, amid impervious gloom, Sullen frowns the serpent dome; Roll'd beneath th' envenom'd tide, Where the sons of sorrow 'bide; Thee, the mighty demon host; Thee, the giants of the frost; Thee, the genii tribes adore; Fenris owns thy sovereign power: And th' imperial prince of fire, Surtur, trembles at thine ire. Thine, the victor's pride to mar; Thine, to turn the scale of war; Chiefs and princes at thy call, From their spheres of glory fall; Empires are in ruin hurl'd; Desolation blasts the world From the dreary realms below, From the dark domains of fear, From the ghastly seats of wo, Hear! tremendous Hela, hear Queen of terror, queen of death! Thee, we summon from beneath. From the deep infernal shade; From the mansion of the dead; Niflheim's black, funereal dome: Hither rise, and hither come! By the potent Runic rhyme, Awful, mystic, and sublime; By the streams that roar below; By the sable fount of wo; By the burning gulf of pain, Muspel's home, and Surtur's reign; By the day when, o'er the world, Wild confusion shall be hurl'd, Rymer mount his fiery car, Giants, genii, rush to war, To vengeance move the prince of fire, And heaven, and earth, in flames expire From the dreary realms below, From the dark domains of fear, From the ghastly seats of wo, Hear! tremendous Hela! hear. He ceased—the flames withdrew their magic light, And, clothed in deeper horrors, frown'd the night. At once, an awful stillness paused around, Hush'd were the winds, and mute the tempest's sound, One deep, portentous calm o'er nature spread, Nor e'en the aspen's restless foliage play'd;— Such the dire calm that glooms Caribean shores, Ere, roused to rage, the fell tornado roars:— Not long, for lo! from central earth released, Shrill through the cavern sigh'd a hollow blast; Wild wails of wo, with shrieks of terror join'd, In deathful murmurs groan along the wind; Peal following peal, hoarse bursts the thunder round, Redoubling echoes swell the dreadful sound; Flash the blue lightnings in continual blaze; One sheet of fire the kindling gloom displays; And o'er the vault, with pale, sulphureous ray, Pour all the horrors of infernal day. Now heaved the vale around, the cavern'd rock, The earth, deep trembling, to its centre shook, Wide yawn'd the rending floor, and gave to sight A chasm tremendous as the gates of night. Slow from the gulf, 'mid lightnings faintly seen, Rose the dread form of death's terrific queen; Of wolfish aspect, and with eyes of flame, Black Jarnvid's witch, her fell attendant, came; Than whom, no monster roams the dark abodes, More fear'd by friends, more hated by the gods. More frightful, more deform'd, than fancy's power Pourtrays the demon of the midnight hour, In hideous majesty, of various hue, Part sallow pale, and part a livid blue, A form gigantic, awful Hela frown'd; Her towering head with sable serpents crown'd; Around her waist, in many a volume roll'd, A crimson adder wreathed his poisonous fold; And o'er her face, beyond description dread, A sulphury mist its shrouding mantle spread. Her voice, the groan of war, the shriek of wo, When sinks the city whelm'd in gulfs below, In tones of thunder, o'er the cavern broke, And nature shudder'd as the demon spoke. “Presumptuous mortal! that, with mystic strain, Dost summon Hela from the realms of pain, What cause thus prompts thee rashly to invade The deep repose of death's eternal shade? What, from the abodes of never-ending night, Calls me, reluctant, to the climes of light?” “Empress supreme! whose wide-extended sway All nature owns, and earth and hell obey; The solemn call no trivial wish inspires; No common cause thy potent aid requires; The dooms of empires on the issue wait, And doubtful tremble in the scale of fate. The glow of morn, on yon extended heath, Will light the nations to the strife of death. There Saracinia's sons their force unite With Scandia's monarch, Woldomir, in fight; By strength combined, proud Odin to o'erwhelm. The fierce invader of the Scandian realm; By Woden favor'd with peculiar grace; Friend of the gods, and odious to thy race. Then, in th' impending fight, thy succor lend, And o'er our host thy arm of strength extend; The hostile bands, protected by thy foes, With dangers circle, and with ruin close; With wild dismay their shrinking ranks pervade; Whelm their pale numbers in th' eternal shade; And wing, with certain aim, the missive dart, Or point the falchion, to the leader's heart.” Thus Ulfo spoke—and Hela thus return'd. “Know, while in primal night creation mourn'd, The eternal cause, the great, all-ruling mind, The various term of human life assign'd; Irrevocably firm, the fix'd intent No power can vary, and no chance prevent. Mark'd by the fates, for years of bloody strife, Rolls the long flood of Odin's varied life; Nor is it ours the stern decree to thwart By open violence, or by covert art. Yet still the power is left us to annoy, Whom rigid heaven denies us to destroy; And, though of life secure, the hostile chief, The wretched victim of severest grief, Shall mourn his arms disgraced, on yonder plain, His laurels blasted, and his heroes slain.” She ceased;—in thunder vanishing from view, The fiends, the cauldron, and the hags withdrew. Back to the camp the enchanter sped his way, Ere, o'er the east, arose the first faint glimpse of day. THEODORE DWIGHT. AFRICAN DISTRESS. “Help! oh, help! thou God of Christians! Save a mother from despair! Cruel white men steal my children! God of Christians, hear my prayer! “From my arms by force they're rended, Sailors drag them to the sea; Yonder ship, at anchor riding, Swift will carry them away. “There my son lies, stripp'd, and bleeding; Fast, with thongs, his hands are bound. See, the tyrants, how they scourge him! See his sides a reeking wound “See his little sister by him; Quaking, trembling, how she lies! Drops of blood her face besprinkle; Tears of anguish fill her eyes. “Now they tear her brother from her; Down, below the deck, he's thrown; Stiff with beating, through fear silent, Save a single, death-like, groan.” Hear the little creature begging!— “Take me, white men, for your own! Spare, oh, spare my darling brother! He 's my mother's only son. “See, upon the shore she's raving: Down she falls upon the sands: Now, she tears her flesh with madness; Now, she prays with lifted hands. “I am young, and strong, and hardy; He 's a sick, and feeble boy; Take me, whip me, chain me, starve me, All my life I'll toil with joy. “Christians! who 's the God you worship? Is he cruel, fierce, or good? Does he take delight in mercy? Or in spilling human blood? “Ah, my poor distracted mother! Hear her scream upon the shore.”— Down the savage captain struck her, Lifeless on the vessel's floor. Up his sails he quickly hoisted, To the ocean bent his way; Headlong plunged the raving mother, From a high rock, in the sea. ECHO NO. 14. From the Norwich Packet, of June 20, 1793. “Monday the 27th inst. being very warm, there appeared in the N. W. several small clouds, which indicated what the earth greatly stood in need of, viz. showers of rain, which afterwards collected and directed their course to the northward of this place, till about three o'clock, when a cloud clothed in sable black gathered in the west, arose and passed in a direct line over this city: wafted with uncommon violence by the wind fluctuating in various directions, presented to the human mind a spectacle alarming to behold: it was highly charged with electric fluid, and almost incessantly burst in streams of crimson fire, which streaked the heavens with astonishing lustre; several of which, from the near connexion between the blaze and report, must have reached the earth not far distant, though we do not learn of any consequential damages sustained. It continued to disburden itself of its contents with unremitted ardor and violence until the shades of evening had spread around us the curtains of the night, when it gradually disappeared; and the horizon shone again clear and bright. Gay Luna who in majestic sway was now travelling the downward skies shone with unusual splendor, and the star bespangled canopy of heaven furnished a scene at once beautiful to the eye of the beholder. The feathered tribe who during the storm were hushed in silence, now erected their plumy wings, as one, attuned to the God of nature their feeble songs of praise, and the neighboring groves amidst creation's smiles, harmonized music echoed through the skies! the earth has received a goodly supply of rain, and the works of nature, undisturbed, laugh and rejoice; let audible gratitude awake the voice of man on this occasion for one of the choicest of heaven's blessings. “We hear that three cows were killed at Bolton last Monday evening, by the lightning.” “Our song resounds a thunder storm once more— “But Norwich' far transcends Bostonia's roar.” On Monday last, the sun with scorching ray, Pour'd down on Norwich rocks a red hot day, Along the streets no verdant weeds appear'd, No blades of grass the geese and goslings cheer'd, No brook, nor pond, mud-puddle, slough, nor pool, Where ducks might paddle, and where pigs might cool: But all was so completely burnt and bare, That had old Babel's king been pastured there, On such short feed, (I do not mean to joke) He never would have staid without a poke. At length, slow rising up north-western skies, Some little clouds about Elijah's size, Told us in hints and indications plain, That they were sensible we wanted rain. At first the teazing showers our patience tried, By sailing northerly at distance wide, Till three o'clock—when lo! a wondrous cloud, Full dress'd in sable black like funeral shroud, Rose in the west, and climb'd its awful way, In proud defiance of the god of day, Who soon perceived his rays were vainly shed, And therefore rashly stripp'd, and went to bed. But not much used to blankets in the heat Of June, his godship soon began to sweat, And snore, and puff, and piteously complain, Which we mistook for thunder, wind and rain. This reverend cloud came on with dreadful rumpus, Wafted by winds which blew all round the compass, And to the mind (the medium of sight) A scene presented pregnant with affright. For overcharged with true electric shot, (Which all who've felt, well know are rather hot) As musket loaded deep on training day, When Captain Flip commands to “bouze away,” From breech to muzzle splits in splinters dire— The cloud incessant burst in streams of fire; While o'er the inky vault the lustre spread, And streak'd the concave with surprising red. Some of these streaks were follow'd by a roar, Which came so near the streak that went before, That if the first the earth did ever find, The latter surely was not far behind. And though we have not heard which way they went, What place they stopp'd at, where their fury spent, Whene'er they're found, like birds of equal feather, I'll lay my ears you'll find them both together. The ardent cloud continued to unlade, Like sea-sick man in violent cascade, Till evening shades, afraid to see the light, Took care to spread the curtains of the night, But all in vain—old Sol, his sweating o'er, Kick'd off the clothes, and still'd his tuneful snore, Just raised his head and oped his drowsy eyes, And gave one flash of lightning through the skies, When lo! the stars who thought the night begun, In wild amazement started back and run; While nodding Phœbus, trimm'd in slumbering cap, Yawn'd out a smile and took his evening nap. But Luna, somewhat wiser than the rest, Stepp'd softly out, in pink and silver dress'd, And trode with cautious step the western way, To see if all were safe where Phœbus lay: For well she knew if Sol again should rise, And catch her idly flaunting round the skies, He'd make her strip to gratify his ire, And dress herself in every day's attire. But when she found he certainly reposed, His lamp in truth burnt out, his eye-lids closed, Round heaven's high arch her car celestial roll'd, O'er starry pavements gemm'd with living gold, From orb to orb her fiery coursers flew, And new born splendors clothed the etherial blue. The feather'd tribe o'erjoy'd to lose the storm, Now ventured forth in many a cackling swarm. And fill'd with noise upraised the plumy wing, And stretch'd on tiptoe oped their throats to sing, And all around, from every stump and tree, Proceeded songs of praise, and songs of glee; While men and beasts stood staring all the while, To see creation ope her mouth and smile. The earth has got of rain a good supply, And everything is wet that late was dry— Now nature's self with mighty legs and voice, May skip in earthquakes and in songs rejoice, While man, the master of the tuneful throng, Shall sound the pitch, and lead the choral song. P. S. As such a storm does rarely fly For nought across the azure sky, 'T is said that on the self-same night Three cows were kill'd at Bolton by 't! Poor Mr Wythe two years ago, Had his barn burnt exactly so. LINES ON THE DEATH OF WASHINGTON. Far, far from hence be satire's aspect rude, No more let laughter's frolic-face intrude, But every heart be fill'd with deepest gloom, Each form be clad with vestments of the tomb. From Vernon's sacred hill dark sorrows flow, Spread o'er the land, and shroud the world in wo. From Mississippi's proud, majestic flood, To where St. Croix meanders through the wood, Let business cease, let vain amusements fly, Let parties mingle, and let faction die, The realm perform, by warm affection led, Funereal honors to the mighty dead. Where shall the heart for consolation turn, Where end its grief, or how forget to mourn? Beyond these clouds appears no cheering ray, No morning star proclaims th' approach of day. Ask hoary Age from whence his sorrows come, His voice is silent, and his sorrow dumb; Enquire of Infancy why droops his head, The prattler lisps—“great Washington is dead.” Why bend yon statesmen o'er their task severe? Why drops yon chief the unavailing tear? What sullen grief hangs o'er yon martial band? What deep distress pervades the extended land? In sad responses sounds from shore to shore— “Our Friend, our Guide, our Father is no more.” Let fond remembrance turn his aching sight, Survey the past, dispel oblivion's night, By Glory led, pursue the mazy road, Which leads the traveller to her high abode, Then view that great, that venerated name, Inscribed in sunbeams on the roll of Fame. No lapse of years shall soil the sacred spot, No future age its memory shall blot; Millions unborn shall mark its sacred fire, And latest Time behold it and admire. A widow'd country! what protecting form Shall ope thy pathway through the gathering storm! What mighty hand thy trembling bark shall guide, Through Faction's rough and overwhelming tide! The hour is past—thy Washington no more Descries, with angel-ken, the peaceful shore. Freed from the terrors of his awful eye, No more fell Treason seeks a midnight sky, But crawling forth, on deadliest mischief bent, Rears her black front, and toils with cursed intent. Behold! arranged in long, and black array, Prepared for conflict, thirsting for their prey, Our foes advance,—nor force nor danger dread, Their fears all vanish'd when his spirit fled. Oft, when our bosoms, fill'd with dire dismay, Saw mischief gather round our country's way; When furious Discord seized her flaming brand, And threatened ruin to our infant land; When faction's imps sow'd thick the seeds of strife, And aim'd destruction at the bliss of life; When war with bloody hand her flag unfurl'd, And her loud trump alarm'd the western world; His awful voice bade all contention cease, At his commands the storms were hush'd to peace. But who can speak, what accents can relate, The solemn scenes which marked the great man's fate! Ye ancient sages, who so loudly claim The brightest station on the list of Fame, At his approach with diffidence retire, His higher worth acknowledge, and admire. When keenest anguish rack'd his mighty mind, And the fond heart the joys of life resign'd, No guilt, nor terror stretch'd its hard control, No doubt obscured the sunshine of the soul. Prepared for death, his calm and steady eye, Look'd fearless upward to a peaceful sky; While wondering angels point the airy road, Which leads the Christian to the house of God. LINES ADDRESSED TO A MOTHER, WHO HAD BEEN ABSENT FROM HOME SEVERAL WEEKS, ON HER SEEING HER INFANT CHILD ASLEEP. Wrapp'd in innocent repose, Lost to all its little woes, See that lovely infant rest, On the pillow's downy breast. Wearied with the toils of day, Little frolics, childish play, Frequent joy, and frequent grief, Nature yields a short relief. Say, my sleeping cherub, say, Whither doth thy spirit stray? Art thou flown to realms above, On some angel's wings of love, Where, array'd in purest white, Dwell the sainted sons of light, Hymning round the eternal throne, Praise to God's Almighty Son? Or dost thou now at random roam; Through creation's nightly tomb, Borne by Death's insidious power, To his temporary bower? Hush the thought!—I see thee smile! Dreams thy little heart beguile; O'er thy sweet, enchanting face, Steals inimitable grace. Say, my little cherub, say, Whither doth thy spirit stray? Hark!—his answering smile replies— “Far from hence my spirit flies; Borne on Fancy's wing, I move To a mother's arms of love, And clasp'd in sweet embraces, rest On her balmy angel-breast. Here the tides of pleasure roll, Rapture charms the licensed soul, Here divinest transports play, Here affection loves to stray, Here I share the envied kiss, Sink in pleasure, drown in bliss. Spotless as the beams of light, Crowding on the ravish'd sight, Ever new its beauties rise, Charming unforbidden eyes. Hark!—My mother's voice benign, Speaks in harmony divine”— Peaceful here, my infant rest, On your raptured parent's breast. Here no hand shall enter rude, No unhallow'd eye intrude; In this paradise of joy, Dwells no spirit to destroy; But, on Virtue's spotless throne, Thy happy Father reigns alone, Licensed here alone to move, Bathing in voluptuous love, Pleasure here without alloy, Pours an endless stream of joy, While its blissful currents roll, Through the mazes of his soul. SARAH WENTWORTH MORTON THE AFRICAN CHIEF. See how the black ship cleaves the main, High bounding o'er the dark blue wave, Remurmuring with the groans of pain, Deep freighted with the princely slave! Did all the gods of Afric sleep, Forgetful of their guardian love, When the white tyrants of the deep, Betrayed him in the palmy grove. A chief of Gambia's golden shore, Whose arm the band of warriors led, Or more—the lord of generous power, By whom the foodless poor were fed. Does not the voice of reason cry, “Claim the first right that nature gave, From the red scourge of bondage fly, Nor deign to live a burden'd slave.” Has not his suffering offspring clung, Desponding round his fetter'd knee; On his worn shoulder, weeping hung, And urged one effort to be free? His wife by nameless wrongs subdued, His bosom's friend to death resign'd; The flinty path-way drench'd in blood; He saw with cold and frenzied mind. Strong in despair, then sought the plain, To heaven was raised his steadfast eye, Resolved to burst the crushing chain, Or 'mid the battle's blast to die. First of his race, he led the band, Guardless of danger, hurling round, Till by his red avenging hand, Full many a despot stain'd the ground. When erst Messenia's sons oppress'd, Flew desperate to the sanguine field, With iron clothed each injured breast, And saw the cruel Spartan yield, Did not the soul to heaven allied, With the proud heart as greatly swell, As when the Roman Decius died, Or when the Grecian victim fell? Do later deeds quick rapture raise, The boon Batavia's William won, Paoli's time-enduring praise, Or the yet greater Washington! If these exalt thy sacred zeal, To hate oppression's mad control, For bleeding Afric learn to feel, Whose chieftain claim'd a kindred soul. Ah, mourn the last disastrous hour, Lift the full eye of bootless grief, While victory treads the sultry shore, And tears from hope the captive chief; While the hard race of pallid hue, Unpractised in the power to feel, Resign him to the murderous crew, The horrors of the quivering wheel. Let sorrow bathe each blushing cheek, Bend piteous o'er the tortured slave, Whose wrongs compassion cannot speak, Whose only refuge was the grave. JOSIAS LYNDON ARNOLD A MODERN ECLOGUE. Caryl the barber, and his wife, of late Had, journeying homeward, words of high debate; He long had lived suspicious of the fair; (“To jealous bosoms, trifles light as air Are confirmations strong”) yet ne'er had been So prompt before to charge her with the sin. The Muse was by, and, pleased with such rare sport, Has told the dialogue in this here sort. CARYL. At three new Boston shopsters have I tried, And bought a chintz would ornament a bride; This bosom-pin, this locket tied with blue, I bought for Susan, thinking she was true: But, ah! for all my love what sad return, Since you for swains beside your Caryl burn. 'T is well I saw you not—these eyes had flow'd Away in tears, and I had lifeless stood. How times have alter'd since I first thee knew! How am I left the wedding day to rue! Ah, luckless Caryl! Susan, faithless fair, Has soil'd her fame, and sunk thee to despair! SUSAN. 'Tis true, O Caryl, times have alter'd quite, Since first you kiss'd me on the nuptial night; Indeed they've alter'd in four seasons gone; But charge not me—the fault is all thy own. While stood our cot on Bagley's fertile plain, I was thy nymph, and thou my only swain. Then in thy presence brighten'd every scene, More red the rose grew, and the grass more green Soon as the sun from eastern skies arose, We left our leafy couch and sweet repose; Then did I first beneath the ashes hide Twice twenty rough-skins, and our meal provide; Then swept—and to my spinning-wheel sat down, Nor envied her who wears a golden crown; And when at noon, with labor spent and heat, Thou didst, O Caryl, to thy cot retreat, I cheer'd thee fainting with a cup of whey, From Comstock's brought, and fann'd the heat away. How often then, attest ye stars above, Did Susan, breadless, make a meal on love. How oft did she refrain from every crust, Though pinch'd with hunger, and, to quench thy thirst, To thee, O Caryl, all the whey resign'd, Contented always while her swain was kind. How oft, O sun, within yon pine-tree grove, Hast thou heard Caryl tell me tales of love; And when thou, hastening down the western sky, Didst seek at eve in Thetis' lap to lie, Then did we to our humble cot repair, And seek for rest and satisfaction there. But now, alas! the happy glass is run, Caryl is faithless—Susan is undone. CARYL. Stay, Susan, stay; from all reproach refrain, And prove me faithless, ere thou dost complain. Here Caryl stands, a pure and spotless youth, (So heaven preserve me as I speak the truth) Here stands he—pure as thou, my lovely bride, Six months before the nuptial knot was tied; But say'st thou this thy own disgrace to cure? Ha! that's a trick I never will endure. I'll beat thee, Susan, for thou art my wife; I'll beat thee, though I love thee as my life. SUSAN. Stay, Caryl, stay; thy beating love restrain, And I'll unfold the reasons why I 'plain. When first, on fame and worldly riches bent, Thee to Pawtucket thy base genius sent, Then fled the sunshine of my former life, And fortune frown'd on Caryl's faultless wife; When at thy shop three customers a day Were shaved, and each his coppers three did pay; How didst thou strut, and talk, and look as big As old M'Laughlin in his horse-tail wig. E'en then I saw some symptoms of disdain, And thought thee colder than my country swain. But when to every house in town you run, And shaved and dress'd them every mother's son, Then money rattled in your once lank purse, And all was prinking, pranking, mince and fuss. Now Caryl drinks with gentry, and carouses At gaming tables and at brothel houses. Now oft at midnight Susan opes the door, And lets him in, a traveller on all four. CARYL. Take that—you hussy, for your lie.— SUSAN. Have done. CARYL. I have, you baggage; now you may go on. SUSAN. Then your affection to decay began, And first I knew th' inconstancy of man. But still your love I did not cease to prize, And tried to make me pleasing in your eyes. When you came home and call'd me swarthy brown, And said such colors would not do in town, Did I not try, at morning, noon and night, And wash and scour and labor to be white? Did I not eat of pipe-stems near a gross, And take of herb-drinks many a bitter dose? Devour raw rice and paper—Indian meal, And chalk—as much as ever I could steal? And when, in scorn, “d?n such a shape,” you cried, Did I not lace me till I almost died? Yet still I fail'd—you sought another fair, And Dermot saw you, Caryl, you know where. You loathed my love, your Susan's arms you fled, And cruel left me in a lonely bed; A female weakness then usurp'd my breast; I sought revenge—my tears must tell the rest. CARYL. Dermot was false, and all he told thee lies; But I forgive thee, Susan; wipe thine eyes. SUSAN. This is the only reason I can give For my past conduct; but with thee I'll live In future, Caryl, spotless as the dove, And faithful as the redbreast to her love. But now let's leave this vile Pawtucket town, And in the country once more settle down: Let's move our hut to Bagley's fertile plain, And dwell in love and happiness again. THE WARRIOR'S DEATH SONG. Deep in the west the sun is gone, And darkness rapidly comes on; But soon his beams again shall rise, And radiant light o'erspread the skies. Thus, though the raging flame destroy This mortal flame, to scenes of joy The soul shall fly, where Podar reigns O'er pleasant woods and fertile plains. There nations shall no more be foes, Nor warriors tribe to tribe oppose; No hideous war-song shall be heard, But peace inspire the ravish'd bard. No arrows tipt with polish'd bone, Nor tomahawk shall there be known; But all, till time itself shall cease, Shall live in harmony and peace. Urge then the torments, haughty foes; Thus death the sooner shall disclose The land where every torment flies, Where endless joys and pleasures rise. Bid fiercer flames around him roll, And try to bend his stubborn soul; Yet vain the hope, the trial vain, To make great Ellac's son complain. No sting of wo, nor pain severe, Shall from his eyelids draw a tear; But e'en his foes themselves shall say, A noble chief has fall'n today. Tell then your sons, ye warriors, tell Without complaint how Kallack fell; How his firm breast no fear appall'd, To die whene'er his nation call'd. Thus shall their manly bosoms glow, With souls invincible by wo, Exult like Ellac's son to die, And to the realms of Podar fly. Thus spake the hero of the shore, Where broad Kanhawa's waters roar; Then closed his eyes, untaught to weep, And sunk in glory's arms to sleep. FRAGMENT, DESCRIPTIVE OF THOSE EXTRAORDINARY ANIMALS WHOSE BONES HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE WESTERN COUNTRY. The monsters rage, and round the earth Spread ruin and destruction fell, Sent by the great Evil Spirit. Pehoogthsi's wrath, Fierce from the angry gates of hell. Haste, my Shootai, haste away, Destruction waits upon delay! Above the highest pines they raise In horrid majesty their head; Their eyes in vengeful anger blaze, Their jaws grind nations of the dead. Haste, my Shootai, haste away, Destruction waits upon delay! Save us, Good Spirit. Oroonoh! at a leap O'er Allegany's height they bound, O'er Huron's darkly rolling deep, And with convulsions rend the ground. Haste, my Shootai, haste away, Destruction waits upon delay! They breathe, the woods are prostrate laid, The rocks are moved; they roar, Old Erie on his fall is stay'd, Kanhawa trembles on his shore. Haste, my Shootai, haste away, Destruction waits upon delay! SONG. While zephyrs fan the verdant groves, And flowerets grace the plain, While shepherds tell the nymphs their loves, And flaunt in pleasure's train; To yonder cottage of my fair My anxious footsteps tend; What joy so great as viewing there A lover and a friend? To her I fear not to disclose The feelings of my heart; She bears a part in all my woes, In all my joys—a part. If e'er she weeps, I kiss the tear, And bid her sorrows end; If she is pleased, joy shows me near A lover and a friend. She 's youthful, innocent and gay, Of perfect mind and mien; She quickly steals all hearts away, Wherever she is seen. But though each shepherd's heart she charms, And they before her bend, Round me alone she throws her arms, A lover and a friend. WILLIAM BOYD WOMAN. When time was young, and nature first began To form this odd, fantastic being, man, She rack'd her fancy to invent a joy Unknown before, to please the smiling boy. Her choicest viands from the field she brought, Cherish'd each herb, and all their uses taught; Press'd the cold earth, and bade the fountain pour Its stream meandering to the distant shore. To cheer the day and banish every pain, She spread luxuriance o'er the festive plain, Smiled on the scene, and call'd the choirist's song To sweeten pleasure, and the joy prolong. Though far around was pour'd the plenteous tide, No charm forgotten, and no bliss denied; Though rich profusion lavish'd all its store, Man saw the tasteless sweets, and pined for more. Still anxious care his feeling heart oppress'd, And pensive languor rankled on his breast. The plague ennui his dearest joys had stole, And solitude's cold pleasure chill'd his soul. Parental care again the task renew'd, Again each art, with fondest zeal pursued; From opening roses cull'd the blushing dye, And the mild lustre of the new-born sky; From every sweet expanding to the view The magic power a soft perfection drew; Bestow'd each grace, that nicest skill could give, And call'd the lovely composition, Eve. The winning fair, from nature's wardrobe dress'd, By heaven applauded, and by man caress'd, Each melting charm with artless pride display'd, In form an angel, and in heart a maid. Now pleasure, chaste as virtue's self could feign, Refined the heart and warm'd the lingering vein; Each joy complete; and man exulting wove The silken fetters of connubial love. Had heaven's behest in providence denied Nature's best gift, and man's too charming pride, No gentle tie the savage breast could bind, And instinct only rule the vacant mind. Enchanting woman bade an Eden smile, Where the rough glebe defied the laborer's toil; On the bare rock a pleasing banquet spread, And taught the flint to yield a downy bed. The happy peasant climbs the mountain's brow, Builds on the cliff, nor asks the plain below; Content and peace beneath the tempest dwell, And lovely woman cheers the humble cell. In softer climes, where beams a milder ray, Where laughing fields enjoy eternal May, Enlighten'd man, to female merit true, Has paid the homage to perfection due. The hardy veteran quits the fatal plain, Where laurell'd honor strode amid the slain; To gentler passions yields the willing heart, Bows to the fair, and owns the pleasing smart. The sceptred despot, now no longer proud, Deserts the throne, and leaves the fawning crowd, Himself a suppliant, to the fair he flies, Lives in her smile, and in her frown he dies. Empires and states in maddening discord rage, Forget affection, and the combat wage For some fair she, whom artful man beguiled, And Troy expires, because a Helen smiled. Cornelia's worth shall grace th' historic page, And all her virtues live to latest age; A shining portrait e'er held up to life, An ancient model for a modern wife. The modest matron, far from public show, Bent the young mind, and taught the heart to grow; Deep in the nursery's shade unenvied shone, Nor wish'd the gewgaws of the world her own. No diamond there its blazing lustre shed, No toilet splendor to the eye was spread; The infant's prattle, and the winning play, With dearer joys beguiled the tedious day, Than tinsell'd show and fading wealth impart, These charm the head, but those delight the heart. Far to the north, where Lapland deserts lie, A waste unpitied by the inclement sky, The savage boor, to sympathy unknown, Aud mutual pleasures, which decrease his own, Stretch'd at his ease, neglects the husband's care, While menial labors grind the hapless fair. From Afric sands, where Siroc's poisonous breath Blasts the young herb, and teems with wasting death, To the mild clime where Ganges laves the plain, Where smiling spring and whispering zephyrs reign, Still lives this truth, by savage man confess'd, Woman beloved, yet woman the oppress'd. The Turk, a tyrant to the captive maid, Confines her beauties to the haram's shade; There, on its wall each dastard act engraved, He counts his glories by the fair enslaved. The jealous knave would tame a female's hate With splendid trifles and the charms of state; With regal pride the lover's warmth would give, And in a prison bid affection live. Preposterous thought! where slavery's galling chain Chills the young wish, and turns each joy to pain, Love, free as air, from cursed oppression flies, Pines at the fetter, and imprison'd dies. In milder Europe, when the infant ray Of pure refinement beam'd uncertain day, The hapless fair each humble labor plied, And cold neglect attended at her side. Now genial science, on the mind has shone, Its rigor soften'd, and its passions won; Now female worth shall honest praise assume, Nor fade neglected in the cloister's gloom. Columbia hail! along thy favor'd shore, The fiend oppression shall be heard no more: No tyrant lord, with jealous fear, shall bind The soft affections of the female mind; No groveling wretch with impious zeal shall dare, Assault the rights of heaven-protected fair. Soon shall the world receive the generous fire, Blush at its follies, and the fair admire; Soon shall the time, by ancient bards foretold, A joyful era to the heart unfold; When female worth with purest beam shall shine, Nor rival man with sordid envy pine; When mutual pleasures undisturb'd shall roll, And the rude Arab own a woman's soul. WILLIAM CLIFFTON. MARY WILL SMILE. The morn was fresh, and pure the gale, When Mary, from her cot a rover, Pluck'd many a wild rose of the vale To bind the temples of her lover. As near his little farm she stray'd, Where birds of love were ever pairing, She saw her William in the shade, The arms of ruthless war preparing. “Though now,” he cried, “I seek the hostile plain, Mary shall smile, and all be fair again.” She seized his hand, and “Ah!” she cried, “Wilt thou to camps and war a stranger Desert thy Mary's faithful side, And bare thy life to every danger? Yet go, brave youth! to arms away! My maiden hands for fight shall dress thee, And when the drum beats far away, I'll drop a silent tear and bless thee. Return'd with honor, from the hostile plain, Mary will smile, and all be fair again. The bugles through the forest wind, The woodland soldiers call to battle, Be some protecting angel kind, And guard thy life when cannons rattle!” She sung, and as the rose appears In sunshine, when the storm is over, A smile beam'd sweetly through her tears, The blush of promise to her lover. Return'd in triumph from the hostile plain, All shall be fair, and Mary smile again. TO A ROBIN. From winter so dreary and long, Escaped, ah! how welcome the day, Sweet Bob with his innocent song, Is return'd to his favorite spray. When the voice of the tempest was heard, As o'er the bleak mountain it pass'd, He hied to the thicket, poor bird! And shrunk from the pitiless blast. By the maid of the valley survey'd, Did she melt at thy comfortless lot? Her hand, was it stretch'd to thy aid, As thou pick'dst at the door of her cot? She did; and the wintery wind, May it howl not around her green grove; Be a bosom so gentle and kind, Only fann'd by the breathings of love. She did; and the kiss of her swain, With rapture, the deed shall requite, That gave to my window again Poor Bob and his song of delight. TO FANCY. Airy traveller, queen of song, Sweetest fancy, ever young, I to thee my soul resign; All my future life be thine: Rich or beggar'd, chain'd or free, Let me live and laugh with thee. Pride perhaps may knock, and say, “Rise thou sluggard, come away:” But can he thy joy impart, Will he crown my leaping heart? If I banish hence thy smile Will he make it worth my while? Is my lonely pittance past, Fleeting good too light to last, Lifts my friend the latch no more, Fancy, thou canst all restore; Thou canst, with thy airy shell, To a palace raise my cell. At night, while stretch'd on lowly bed, When tyrant tempest shakes my shed, And pipes aloud; how bless'd am I, All cheering nymph, if thou art by, If thou art by to snatch my soul Where billows rage and thunders roll. From cloud, o'er peering mountain's brow We'll mark the mighty coil below, While round us innocently play The lightning's flash, and meteor's ray And, all so sad, some spectre form Is heard to moan amid the storm. With thee to guide my steps I'll creep In some old haunted nook to sleep, Lull'd by the dreary night-bird's scream, That flits along the wizard stream, And there, till morning 'gins appear, The tales of troubled spirits hear. Sweet 's the dawn's ambiguous light, Quiet pause 'tween day and night, When, afar, the mellow horn Chides the tardy-gaited morn, And asleep is yet the gale On sea-beat mount, and river'd vale. But the morn, though sweet and fair, Sweeter is when thou art there; Hymning stars successive fade, Fairies hurtle through the shade, Love-lorn flowers I weeping see, If the scene is touch'd by thee. When unclouded shines the day, When my spirits dance and play, To some sunny bank we'll go Where the fairest roses blow, And in gamesome vein prepare Chaplets for thy spangled hair. Thus through life with thee I'll glide, Happy still whate'er betide, And while plodding sots complain Of ceaseless toil and slender gain, Every passing hour shall be Worth a golden age to me. Then lead on, delightful power, Lead, Oh! lead me to thy bower; I to thee my soul resign, All my future life be thine. Rich or beggar'd, chain'd or free, Let me live and laugh with thee. A FLIGHT OF FANCY. For lonely shades, and rustic bed, Let philosophic spirits sigh; I ask no melancholy shed, No hermit's dreary cave, not I. But where, to skirt some pleasant vale, Ascends the rude uncultured hill, Where 'midst its cliffs to every gale, Young Echo mocks the passing rill: Where spring to every merry year, Delighted trips her earliest round; Sees all her varied tints appear, And all her fragrant soul abound; There let my little villa rise, In beauty's simple plumage drest: And greet with songs the morning skies, Sweet bird of art, in nature's nest! Descending there, on golden wing, Shall fancy, with her bounties roam; And every laurell'd art shall bring An offering fair to deck my home. Green beds of moss, in dusky cells, When twilight sleeps from year to year, And fringed plats, where Flora dwells, With the wild wood shall neighbor near. The fairies through my walks shall roam, And sylphs inhabit every tree; Come Ariel, subtlest spirit, come, I'll find a blossom there for thee; Extended wide, the diverse scene, My happy casement shall command, The busy farm, the pasture green, And tufts where shelter'd hamlets stand. Some dingle oft shall court my eye To dance among the flow'rets there, And here a lucid lake shall lie, Emboss'd with many an islet fair. From crag to crag, with devious sweep, Some frantic flood shall headlong go, And, bursting o'er the dizzy steep, Shall slumber in the lake below. In breezy isles and forests near, The sylvans oft their haunts shall leave; And oft the torrent pause to hear The lake-nymph's song, at silent eve. There shall the moon with half shut eye, Delirious, hear her vocal beam, To fingering sounds responsive sigh, And bless the hermit's midnight dream. No magic weed nor poison fell Shall tremble there; nor drug uncouth, To round the muttering wizard's spell, Or bathe with death the serpent's tooth. No crusted ditch nor festering fen With plagues shall teem, a deadly brood. No monster leave his nightly den To lap the 'wilder'd pilgrim's blood. But on the rose's dewy brink, Each prismy tear shall catch the gleam; And give the infant buds to drink, The colors of the morning beam. The waters sweet, from whispering wells, Shall loiter 'neath the flowery brake; Shall visit oft the Naiad's cells, And hie them to the silver lake. The muse shall hail, at peep of dawn, Melodiously the coming day; At eve her song shall soothe the lawn, And with the mountain echoes play. There spring shall laugh at winter's frown, There summer blush for gamesome spring, And autumn, prank'd in wheaten crown, His stores to hungry winter bring. 'T is mine! 't is mine! this sacred grove, Where truth and beauty may recline, The sweet resort of many a love; Monimia, come and make it thine. For thee the bursting buds are ripe, The whistling robin calls thee here, To thee complains the woodland pipe; Will not my loved Monimia hear? A fawn I'll bring thee, gentle maid, To gambol round thy pleasant door; I'll curl thee wreaths that ne'er shall fade, What shall I say to tempt thee more? The blush that warms thy maiden cheek, The morning eye's sequester'd tear, For me, thy kindling passion speak And chain this subtle vision here. Spots of delight, and many a day Of summer love for me shall shine; In truth my beating heart is gay, At sight of that fond smile of thine. Come, come, my love, away with me, The morn of life is hastening by, To this gay scene we'll gaily flee, And sport us 'neath the peaceful sky. And when that awful day shall rise, That sees thy cheek with age grow pale, And the soul fading in thine eyes, We'll sigh and quit the weeping vale. ROBERT TREAT PAINE. ADAMS AND LIBERTY. Ye sons of Columbia, who bravely have fought For those rights, which unstained from your sires had descended, May you long taste the blessings your valor has bought, And your sons reap the soil which their fathers defended. 'Mid the reign of mild peace, May your nation increase, With the glory of Rome, and the wisdom of Greece; And ne'er shall the sons of Columbia be slaves, While the earth bears a plant, or the sea rolls its waves. In a clime, whose rich vales feed the marts of the world, Whose shores are unshaken by Europe's commotion, The trident of commerce should never be hurl'd, To incense the legitimate powers of the ocean. But should pirates invade, Though in thunder array'd, Let your cannon declare the free charter of trade. For ne'er shall the sons, &amp;c. The fame of our arms, of our laws the mild sway, Had justly ennobled our nation in story, Till the dark clouds of faction obscured our young day, And enveloped the sun of American glory. But let traitors be told, Who their country have sold, And barter'd their God for his image in gold, That ne'er will the sons, &amp;c. While France her huge limbs bathes recumbent in blood, And society's base threats with wide dissolution; May peace, like the dove who returned from the flood, Find an ark of abode in our mild constitution. But though peace is our aim, Yet the boon we disdain, If bought by our sovereignty, justice, or fame. For ne'er shall the sons, &amp;c. 'T is the fire of the flint, each American warms Let Rome's haughty victors beware of collision, Let them bring all the vassals of Europe in arms, We 're a world by ourselves, and disdain a division. While with patriot pride, To our laws we 're allied, No foe can subdue us, no faction divide. For ne'er shall the sons, &amp;c. Our mountains are crown'd with imperial oak; Whose roots, like our liberties, ages have nourish'd; But long e'er our nation submits to the yoke, Not a tree shall be left on the field where it flourished. Should invasion impend, Every grove would descend. From the hill-tops, they shaded, our shores to defend. For ne'er shall the sons, &amp;c. Let our patriots destroy Anarch's pestilent worm; Lest our liberty's growth should be check'd by corrosion; Then let clouds thicken round us; we heed not the storm; Our realms fear no shock, but the earth's own explosion. Foes assail us in vain, Though their fleets bridge the main, For our altars and laws with our lives we 'll maintain. For ne'er shall the sons, &amp;c. Should the tempest of war overshadow our land, Its bolts could ne'er rend freedom's temple asunder; For, unmoved, at its portal, would Washington stand, And repulse, with his breast, the assaults of the thunder! His sword from the sleep Of its scabbard would leap, And conduct, with its point, every flash to the deep! For ne'er shall the sons, &amp;c. Let fame to the world sound America's voice; No intrigues can her sons from their governments sever; Her pride is her Adams; her laws are his choice, And shall flourish, till liberty slumbers for ever. Then unite heart and hand, Like Leonidas' band, And swear to the God of the ocean and land, That ne'er shall the sons of Columbia be slaves, While the earth bears a plant, or the sea rolls its waves. THE STREET WAS A RUIN. The street was a ruin, and night's horrid glare Illumined with terror the face of despair; While houseless, bewailing, Mute pity assailing, A mother's wild shrieks pierced the merciless air. Beside her stood Edward, imploring each wind, To wake his loved sister, who linger'd behind; Awake, my poor Mary, Oh! fly to me, Mary; In the arms of your Edward, a pillow you 'll find. In vain he call'd, for now the volumed smoke, Crackling, between the parting rafters broke; Through the rent seams the forked flames aspire, All, all, is lost; the roof, the roof 's on fire! A flash from the window brought Mary to view, She scream'd as around her the flames fiercely blew; Where art thou, mother? Oh! fly to me, brother! Ah! save your poor Mary, who lives but for you! Leave not poor Mary, Ah! save your poor Mary! Her vision'd form descrying, On wings of horror flying, The youth erects his frantic gaze, Then plunges in the maddening blaze! Aloft he dauntless soars, The flaming room explores; The roof in cinders crushes, Through tumbling walls he rushes! She 's safe from fear's alarms; She faints in Edward's arms! Oh! nature, such thy triumphs are, Thy simplest child can bravely dare. ODE SUNG AT THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE FAUSTUS ASSOCIATION. On the tent-plains of Shinah, truth's mystical clime, When the impious turret of Babel was shatter'd, Lest the tracks of our race, in the sand-rift of time, Should be buried, when Shem, Ham and Japheth were scattered, Rose the genius of art, Man to man to impart, By a language, that speaks, through the eye, to the heart. CHORUS. Yet rude was invention, when art she reveal'd, For a block stamp'd the page, and a tree plough'd the field. As time swept his pennons, art sigh'd, as she view'd How dim was the image, her emblem reflected; When, inspired, father Faust broke her table of wood, Wrought its parts into shape, and the whole reconnected, Art with mind now could rove, For her symbols could move, Ever casting new shades, like the leaves of a grove.CHORUS. And the colors of thought in their elements run, As the prismatic glass shows the hues of the sun. In the morn of the west, as the light roll'd away From the grey eve of regions, by bigotry clouded, With the dawn woke our Franklin, and, glancing the day, Turn'd its beams through the mist, with which art was enshrouded; To kindle her shrine, His Promethean line Drew a spark from the clouds, and made printing divine!CHORUS. When the fire by his rod was attracted from heaven, Its flash by the type, his conductor, was given. Ancient wisdom may boast of the spice and the weed, Which embalm'd the cold form of its heroes and sages; But their fame lives alone on the leaf of the reed, Which has grown through the clefts in the ruins of ages; Could they rise, they would shed, Like Cicero's head, Tears of blood on the spot, where the world they had led.CHORUS. Of Pompey and Cæsar unknown is the tomb, But the type is their forum, the page is their Rome. Blest genius of type! down the vista of time As thy flight leaves behind thee this vex'd generation, Oh! transmit on thy scroll, this bequest from our clime, The press can cement, or dismember a nation. Be thy temple the mind! There, like Vesta, enshrined, Watch and foster the flame, which inspires human kind!CHORUS. Preserving all arts, may all arts cherish thee; And thy science and virtue teach man to be free! JOHN LATHROP. SPEECH OF CANONICUS. Our God commands. To fertile realms I haste, Compared with which, your gardens are a waste; There, in full bloom, eternal spring abides, And swarming fishes glide through azure tides; Continual sunshine gilds the cloudless skies, No mist conceals Keesuckquand The deity who resides in the sun. from our eyes, Herds of red deer before the hunter bound, And fragrance floats along th' enamell'd ground. There, your forefathers, dexterous with the bow, Urge the fleet chase, and o'er the greensward glow; Or, in a grove recount their deeds of war, Number their scalps, and glory in each scar, Or, contemplate—their most exalted theme— The power and goodness of their chief supreme! Yet ere he goes, your Sachem will relate, Your primal origin and future fate, Nor think th' important history too long, An idle story, or a foolish song; For him, when young, his parent king inform'd, And while the impressive tale his bosom warm'd, Deep in his memory sunk the truths sublime, And still their prints are unimpaired by time. Observe ye then; when summer's heats are gone, The north wind rushes from the frozen zone, Borne by the blasts, the shivering seabirds fly To milder regions and a warmer sky, Through the keen air they skim their lofty way, To where the sun beams ever genial day, And far beyond Potomac's swelling tides, They seek the pleasant fields where God resides: There, coeternal with the earth he reign'd, And a long solitary rule maintain'd; For then, these plains no verdant herbage bore, No cheerful wigwam show'd its matted door, No forests waved their foliage in the wind, Nor round the chestnut clung the sheltering rind; This ample range no living creature trod, And in the universe, alone, was God! First, in his image, Manitoos he made, Inferior spirits, his designs to aid, He bade Keesuckquand live in yon bright blaze, And o'er creation shed enlivening rays:— Placed Paumpagussit The sea-god. in the heaving seas, Subjecting winds and waves to his decrees. Next in mild radiance shone the silent moon, Queen of the sprites that gleam in night's pale noon, Whose strong enchantment and mysterious spell, Can e'en the dead from their repose compel; With heat accursed dissolve our flesh away, And torture, as they mould the magic clay. Yotaanit, The god of fire. too, he form'd, who, when 't is dark, Elicits from a stone, the precious spark, That, the poor Indian, cold and weary, warms, And cheers the tedious hours when winter storms Bid the chill'd blood through all life's channels flow, And draws a beverage pure and sweet from snow, When, bridged with ice, the stagnant rivers sleep, And cease to pour their tributes to the deep. Tempt not his rage, for dreadful is his ire, Then harvests, trees and towns ascend in fire; If his consuming wrath our crimes provoke, He scatters to the winds our wealth in smoke; From him our comfort or distress proceeds, Evil or good proportioned to our deeds. Then burst our mother Earth's prolific womb; Then, groves aspired and meads began to bloom, The living streams, each mountain source to shun, Roll sparkling down, and in their courses run; The Seipmanitog, River-gods. confluent waters wed, And o'er the teeming soil a green luxuriance spread. Next, beasts were formed, the tenants of the wood, Birds for the air, and fishes for the flood. First in the briny depth, the cumbrous whale; The eagle, yon blue eminence to scale; The wily fox, whose sense eludes our arts, And venomed snake, that on the unwary darts; The reasoning beaver; and the moose we prize, Whose flesh our meat—whose skin our garb supplies; Innumerous animals of various brood, That prey with ravenous teeth, or browsing, gain their food. Creation groan'd when with laborious birth, Mammoth was born to rule his parent earth,— Mammoth! I tremble while my voice recounts, His size that tower'd o'er all our misty mounts,— His weight a balance for yon pine-crowned hills, On whose broad front half heaven in dew distils;— His motions forced the starry spheres to shake, The sea to rear—the solid land to quake. His breath a whirlwind. From his angry eye, Flash'd flames like fires that light the northern sky; The noblest river scarce supplied him drink,— Nor food, the herds that grazed along its brink;— Trampling through forests would the monster pass, Breasting the stoutest oaks like blades of grass! Creation finished, God a sabbath kept, And twice two hundred moons profoundly slept; At length, from calm and undisturbed repose, With kind intent the sire of nature rose;— Northward he bent his course, with parent care, To view his creatures and his love declare, To bless the works his wisdom erst had plann'd, And with fresh bounties fill the grateful land. Hoar Paumpagussit swell'd with conscious pride, And bore the Almighty o'er each looming tide; Sweet flowering bushes sprang where'er he trod, And groves, and vales, and mountains, hail'd their God; With more effulgent beams Keesuckquand shone, And lent to night a splendor like his own. Thus moved the deity. But vengeful wrath, Soon gather'd awful glooms around his path, Approaching near to Mammoth's wide domain, He view'd the ravage of the tyrant's reign. Not the gaunt wolf, nor cougar fierce and wild, Escaped the tusks that all the fields despoil'd; No beast that ranged the valley, plain or wood, Was spared by earth's fell chief and his insatiate brood. Nor did just anger rest. Behold, a storm Of sable horrors clothe the eternal's form. Loud thunders burst while forked lightnings dart, And each red bolt transfix'd a Mammoth's heart, Tall cedars crash'd beneath them falling prone, And heaven rebellow'd with their dying groan. So, undermined by inward fires, or time, Some craggy mount that long has tower'd sublime, Tumbles in ruins with tremendous sound, And spreads a horrible destruction round; The trembling land through all its caverns roars, And ocean hoarsely draws his billows from the shores. Mammoth, meanwhile, opposed his maily hide, And shagged front, that thunderbolts defied; Celestial arms from his rough dead he shook, And trampling with his hoofs, the blunted weapons broke. At length, one shaft discharged with happier aim, Pierced his huge side and wrapp'd his bulk in flame. Mad with the anguish of the burning wound, With furious speed he raged along the ground, And pass'd Ohio's billows with a bound,— Thence, o'er Wabash and Illinois he flew,— Deep to their beds the river gods withdrew, Affrighted nature trembled as he fled, And God alone, continued free from dread. Mammoth in terrors—awfully sublime, Like some vast comet, blazing from our clime, Impetuous rush'd. O'er Allegany's brow He leap'd, and howling plung'd to wilds below; There, in immortal anguish he remains, No peace he knows;—no balm can ease his pains; And oft his voice appals the chieftain's breast, Like hollow thunders murmuring from the west,— To every Sachem dreadful truths reveals, And monarchs shudder at its solemn peals. Such is the punishment, by righteous fate, The dread avenger of each injured state, Reserved for tyrant chiefs, who madly dare Oppress the tribes committed to their care. Almighty wrath pursues them for their deeds,— They stab their souls in every wretch that bleeds, The hideous wound eternal shall endure,— Remorse, despair,—alas, what skill can cure! Onega then, the forest's fairest child, Sweet as the violet, as the turtle mild, Bloom'd in her sixteenth summer's perfect charms, And fill'd each bosom with love's soft alarms. One favor'd youth her gentle breast inspired, One youth her heart with mutual passion fired: Yet chastely tender was the virgin flame, That warm'd life's genial current through her frame; The beauteous novice gave it friendship's name;— Alas! too soon the maid was forced to prove, What sad misfortunes owe their birth to love. Oswego, pride of Narraghanset's plains, Tower'd as the cedar, o'er his fellow swains; His air was noble,—every motion grace,— His soul's high valor lighten'd from his face;— Fearless of death he ranged the dangerous field, And scorn'd the raging boar—or foe conceal'd, The insidious serpent in the tangled brake, Or herds of moose, whose hoofs the champaign shake Each night,—how welcome every night return'd! While his true heart with fond impatience burn'd, He flew, Onega in the grove to meet, And lay his choicest trophies at her feet, To pass mild evening's happy hours away, And rest in love's embrace from all the toils of day. Ah mortals! reckless of approaching doom, How soon the sun of pleasure sets in gloom, The fairy fields of juvenile delight, Are veiled in shades of unexpected night! One summer eve, as by a limpid stream, In pleasing converse on their darling theme, Lost to the world—no truant thought had flown, To other pleasures than were their's alone; In sweet idea rose their calm retreat, Their russet cabin—mild contentment's seat, Where every joy concentered should create, A state of bliss to mock the frowns of fate, And as the raptured mind uncheck'd could trace, Each other's beauties in their infant race, A modest glow suffused Onega's face. Sudden she shriek'd! Aghast the Indian swain, Beheld her life-blood!—Speech and sense are vain— What words can utter what no breast can know— Murder's first pang—and nature's primal throe! Death instant seized his prey!—A fatal dart Pierced to the inmost fountain of her heart. Oswego!—what avail'd thy speed or skill, Thy love, thy faith, to avert the blow of ill. Happy for thee had he that skill possess'd, Who aim'd the erring arrow at thy breast!— God's mission'd Wakon The wakon-bird. when her spirit fled, To his abode th' angelic stranger led, The Sire divine a gracious welcome smiled, And view'd well pleased his pure and fairest child; Companion now of him and first restored, She shines in heaven—by grateful man adored. Next to the moon, she sheds her genial light, The brightest star that decks the breast of night. But when Keesuckquand rolls his orb on high, She shuns the intenser ardor of the sky, With Cawtontowwit's love supremely blest, In paradise she finds the balm of rest. O'er sad Oswego's heart-afflicting tale, Sweet Indian girls shall many an eveeye bewail!— Ere yet his mind was from delirium free, The ruthless murderers bound him to a tree; With cruel taunts, exulting in his wo, And savage yells they broke his useless bow,— Thus break thy heart, they cried, that love repaid, With the fond passion of the matchless maid, Now gone to heaven! Ah hadst thou fallen alone, Our ears had feasted on her piteous moan— Her life protracted through long years of wo, Had caused our hearts with ecstasies to glow. No joy remains for us. Peace ne'er shall come, With scented breath to cheer our dreary home, No parent's welcome meet us at the door,— For us no feasts shall load the verdant floor, No wives or children soothe our toil or care, Ours is the deepest hell of black despair. We fly from this ensanguined scene, and leave Our fathers, mothers, sisters, friends to grieve; Die then, before we go! and taste a joy We cannot covet, witness or destroy— A friendly tomax then like lightning driven, Released Oswego's soul—it flew to love and heaven! This deed of death perform'd, the vagrant band, Sojourn'd in exile to a distant land, And near Ontario's hoarsely murmuring wave They form'd a tribe,—blood-thirsty, bold and brave: At length, in justice to Oswego's fame, They gave their council town his deathless name— And long as Onondaga's waters flow, Shall live th' effects of murder—war and wo;— Deep in our woods and round our rock-bound coasts, Shall rage, alas! their mad infuriate hosts, And transient peace, but deadlier vigor yield To rush with wilder vengeance to the field. Hence, train'd to arms our strong and dauntless bands Yell the loud war-whoop through offending lands; Snuff the red smoke that mantles o'er the plain, Crimson'd with gore and reeking with the slain, Till full revenge hath satisfied our wrongs, And the clouds echo with triumphant songs. JOSEPH STORY. FROM THE POWER OF SOLITUDE. Far from the world, its pleasures and its strife, The good St. Aubin passed his tranquil life; Deep in a glen the rural mansion rose, And half an acre spann'd its modest close; Just by the door a living streamlet roll'd, Whose pebbly bottom gleam'd with sandy gold, There first the woodlark hail'd propitious spring, The humming insect dipp'd his glossy wing, The branching elms in ancient grandeur spread, Inweaved with myrtles near its babbling head. Behind, vast mountains closed the wondrous vi Hung o'er the horizon veil'd in hazy blue, Save when the shutting eve mid vapors hoar Roll'd its last gleams their woody summits o'er; And, seen at distance, through some opening brake Transparent brightness lit the neighboring lake. —Scenes, where Salvator's soul had joy'd to climb Mid wilds abrupt, and images sublime, Or caught with kindling glance the bold designs, Where horror's form on beauty's lap reclines. Meek was St. Aubin's soul, his gentle air, Spoke to the searching glance the man of care; Unlike the giant oak, which propp'd on high, Looks o'er the storm, and dares its bolts defy, But as the humbler reed, whose pliant train Bend to the breeze, and rise to bloom again. His ready smile relieved the welcome poor, Who throng'd with daily joy his opening door; Unskill'd by worldly arts the soul to scan, His social nature loved the race of man; Nor sought by godly rites religious praise, More pleased to pay obeisance, than to raise; Nor wish'd the book-taught lore, whose schemes confined To one small spot the charities of mind. Let the vain Levite pass the other side In courtly pomp, in dull, official pride, His proffer'd alms the wandering stranger found, Wine for his heart, and ointment for his wound; The cheer reply, the scholar's modest jest, In want a shelter, and a home for rest. One darling daughter claim'd the good man's care, Gay, as the lark, but scarce more gay than fair; Light were the sportive locks, whose curls profuse Hung o'er her neck in native wildness loose; Blue were the speaking eyes, whose bended lash Half hid and half betray'd a fluttering flash; Health's glowing rose, in shadow'd lustre sleek, Diffused its virgin blush o'er either cheek; Love in her form the bright perfection traced, Yet dress'd the model, still to nature chaste; No sober tricks, no mawkish whims confined Her lively ease, her innocence of mind; A parent's taste, each pure refinement taught, And fix'd the polish, when it form'd the thought, To fancy's lustre lent the touch of art, And gave the judgment force to guide the heart. Up with the morn the hermit skimm'd the dew, And through the echoing woods his shrill horn blew; At noon well pleased beside some rippling stream Wove blameless fiction's legendary dream, Or, lull'd to peace, with curious love pursued The courteous muse through every changing mood, Wept at her woes, of many a tear beguiled, And felt her joys, and acted o'er the child. But when the curfew toll'd the hour of rest, And eve's fine blush imbued the glowing west, Beneath a shadowy bower, with myrtles crown'd, His moral lectures constant audience found. Charm'd to his knees his cheerful infant came To lisp with trembling voice a father's name, Rehearsed her early task, and pleased awhile With earnest sweetness drew his anxious smile. There too in riper age the artless Jane Pour'd in wild tones her melancholy strain, Or touch'd the lute with many a pensive air, Or breath'd her grateful soul in thanks and prayer; Such holy rites the good man loved to keep, Till praise and blessing brought the hour of sleep. Well may remembrance love the favor'd day My truant footsteps chance to pass that way, When on his door-stone sat the sage and told, How mind and sense their gradual powers unfold; Then higher raised the moral pleasures traced, Whose touch harmonious charms the nascent taste, With love and rapture warms the poet's page, Or moulds to deeds divine a slothful age; And thence, as holier purpose fired his soul, Sung the First Cause, whose wisdom form'd the whole. The while he spoke, methought his spirit shed Some heavenly dew of mingled hope and dread; Mysterious influence seem'd to haunt the shade, And round his face transfiguring brightness play'd. But all is past, and scarce the eye can trace One ruin'd monument of former grace. Short is the tale, nor power, nor harsh disdain, With lordly triumph grasp'd his small domain, Nor base seduction lured by syren charms His rifled treasure from a father's arms: Heaven frown'd severe, its awful mandate sent, And claim'd the darling hope its bounty lent. Beside the couch, where Jane expiring lay, The hermit knelt, and prayed, or seem'd to pray, Dim were his eyes, with anxious vigils worn, Yet spoke a soul with no harsh tumults torn; E'en in the agonies of dumb despair, Devotion's smile was seen and cherish'd there: And, as the lingering powers of life decayed, Faith beam'd her radiance through the deepening shade, With firm reliance drank the parting breath, Kiss'd the pale lips, and closed the eyes in death. Through brighter realms the unbodied cherub sought, Realms pure in bliss beyond the soar of thought. Slow through the narrow path, by misery worn, Pass'd the veil'd corpse, in shrouded silence borne; No vain parade, no courtly pageant spread Their sickly honors round the virgin dead; Strew'd o'er the bier some vernal flowers were seen, And here and there a sweet briar fell between. The father came in sorrow's holiest gloom, His raised eye fix'd on hopes beyond the tomb, Still, as the tempest, hush'd in dread suspense, Yet mild, as twilight greets the wakening sense; No mutter'd groans, no stifled anguish shook His meek repose, his calm, unalter'd look, Save, when the ritual closed its sainted strain, And o'er the coffin roll'd the earth again, One lingering tear, that seem'd the man to speak, With briny lustre trickled down his cheek, One lingering tear was all his spirit gave, Then bow'd a last farewell, and left the grave! Yet had not memory lost her soothing art, Nor fancy closed her empire in the heart: When up the groves unclouded moonlight stream'd At the lone hour, to goblins sacred deem'd, When sober day, mid vapory glooms descried, Shot its faint crimson round at eventide, Oft would he rove some mountain's brow along, And pour in shatter'd tones his plaintive song; Kiss the stray flowers, which dress'd the streamlet's marge, Or row athwart the lake his aged barge; And when some spot, where Jane was wont to roam Some favorite pastime call'd his spirit home, If once a sigh his heaving bosom press'd, His trust in heaven was all that sigh express'd. Oft would he trim his wintry hearth, and court Remember'd scenes of pleasantry and sport, Mark, where the lute secured its dusty place, The needled landscape on the wainscot trace, The quaint remark, the evening task review, And chase the fleeting shades, and dream anew. Nor smile, ye proud, if thoughts, like these, engage The friendless soul in melancholy age, More sweet, than all the hymns of active joy, One moment sacred to this chaste employ, One pious hour, to moral musing given, Its relish truth, its harmonies from heaven! And, as the hapless wretch, by storms o'ercast, Clings, shuddering clings him, to the fatal mast, So hope and love, yet buoyant on the wave, Shall snatch their relics from the ravenous grave, And most, as life recedes, with fond alarms Fold the dear types immortal in their arms. Near where a cypress shades the lonely heath, Long has St. Aubin slept the sleep of death; O'er the rude hillock waves the rank grass high, And moans the wild blast, as it hurtles by: One simple stone, with village rhymes bedight, Just tells the tale to every passing wight, And bids his drooping soul aspire to raise Such love in life, in death such honest praise. DAVID EVERETT A BRANCH OF THE MAPLE. Let the tall oak the bolts of heaven deride, Or deal his mimic thunder on the tide; Be this the theme for Albion's lofty muse, An humbler task, my fameless pen pursues. Shall roses bloom in verse from age to age, Shrubs spread their foliage on the poet's page; The willow, poplar, fir and cedar throng Alike the rustic and the classic song; Pines wave in Milton, and no bard be found, To plant the maple on poetic ground? Columbia's muse forbids, in simple strain, She sings the maple and the hardy swain, Who draws the nectar from her silver pores, Nor envies India all its pamper'd stores. What though the cane, our colder clime denies; The cultured plant a native tree supplies; A tree, the fairest of the forest kind, Alike for use and ornament design'd. For use to those, who first essay the wood, To form the table and supply its food; To warm the laborer by its bounty fed; And rear the lowly cottage o'er his head: For ornament, to grace the winding rill, Shade the green vale or wave upon the hill; Or leave the forest, where it useless grows, Rise in the cultured field in stately rows, Spread o'er the rocky waste a shady grove, The haunt for sportive mirth and pensive love. Ere jarring seasons rest in equal scales; While winter now, and now the spring prevails; Sol's milder beams around the maple play, Frost chills by night, a thrilling warmth by day, Dilates each tube; the tube, by mystic laws, The sap nutritious from earth's bosom draws; As higher still the swelling tube distends, The circling sap to every branch ascends; Now each young bud the rich donation shares, For laurel'd spring his earliest wreath prepares. Great universal cause, mysterious power! That clothes the forest, and that paints the flower; Bids the fell poison in the Upas grow, And sweet nutrition in the maple flow; Let Berkeley's pupil dream in endless trance; The wilder'd athiest form his world by chance, By this, his reason, that his sense belied, A world discarded, and a God denied; In spite of these, the impartial eye must see Each leaf a volume—its great author, thee; Nor less in every twig than Aaron's rod, Behold the agency of nature's God! THOMAS GREEN FESSENDEN. ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF WASHINGTON. Why moves to mournful measures slow Yon sable retinue of wo, With tearful eye and visage pale? And why this universal gloom? Sure Nature trembles o'er her tomb, And bids her wilder'd children wail! Do plagues infest, do wars alarm, Has God in wrath made bare his arm, To hurl his bolts of vengeance round? Have towns been sack'd by hostile ire, Have cities sunk in floods of fire, While earthquakes shook the shuddering ground? Ah! no, thy sons, Columbia, mourn, A hero past that fatal “bourne From whence no traveller returns;” Before him none more good, more great, E'er felt th' unerring shafts of fate, Though glory's lamp illume their urns. Behold yon pallid war-worn chief, A marble monument of grief, Who once our troops to victory led;— The burst of sorrow now control, But now the tears of anguish roll, A tribute to th' immortal dead! Fain would the muse those virtues scan, Which dignified the godlike man, And launch in seas without a shore; But sure his name alone conveys More than a thousand hymns of praise, The matchless Washington 's no more! AN ODE. Almighty Power! the One Supreme! Our souls inspire, attune our lays With hearts as solemn as our theme, To sing hosannas to thy praise! Then, while we swell the sacred song, And bid the pealing anthem rise, May seraphim the strain prolong, And hymns of glory fill the skies. Thy word omnific form'd this earth, Ere time began revolving years— Thy fiat gave to nature birth And tuned to harmony the spheres. When stern oppression's iron hand Our pious fathers forced to roam, And o'er the wild wave seek the land Where freedom rears her hallow'd dome— When tempests howl'd, and o'er the main, Pale horror rear'd his haggard form; Thou didst the fragile bark sustain To stem the fury of the storm! When savage hordes, from wilds immense, Raised the shrill war-whoops frantic yell, Thine arm made bare in our defence, Dispersed the gloomy hosts of hell! Thou bad'st the wilderness disclose The varied sweets of vernal bloom— The desert blossom'd like the rose, And breathed Arabia's rich perfume! Look down from heaven's empyreal height, And gild with smiles this happy day. Send us some chosen son of light Our feet to guide in wisdom's way. The sons of Faction strike with awe, And hush the din of party rage, That liberty, secured by law, May realize a golden age. On those thy choicest blessings shower To whom the cares of state are given; May justice wield the sword of power, Till earth 's the miniature of heaven! TABITHA TOWZER. Miss Tabitha Towzer is fair, No guinea pig ever was neater, Like a hakmatak slender and spare, And sweet as a mush-squash, or sweeter. Miss Tabitha Towzer is sleek, When dress'd in her pretty new tucker, Like an otter that paddles the creek, In quest of a mud-pout, or sucker. Her forehead is smooth as a tray, Ah! smoother than that, on my soul, And turn'd, as a body may say, Like a delicate neat wooden-bowl. To what shall I liken her hair, As straight as a carpenter's line, For similes sure must be rare, When we speak of a nymph so divine. Not the head of a Nazarite seer, That never was shaven or shorn. Nought equals the locks of my dear, But the silk of an ear of green corn. My dear has a beautiful nose, With a sled-runner crook in the middle, Which one would be led to suppose Was meant for the head of a fiddle. Miss Tabby has two pretty eyes, Glass buttons shone never so bright, Their love-lighted lustre outvies The lightning-bug's twinkle by night. And oft with a magical glance, She makes in my bosom a pother, When leering politely askance, She shuts one, and winks with the other. The lips of my charmer are sweet, As a hogshead of maple molasses, And the ruby-red tint of her cheek, The gill of a salmon surpasses. No teeth like her's ever were seen, Nor ever described in a novel, Of a beautiful kind of pea-green, And shaped like a wooden-shod-shovel. Her fine little ears, you would judge, Were wings of a bat in perfection; A dollar I never should grudge To put them in Peale's grand collection. Description must fail in her chin, At least till our language is richer; Much fairer than ladle of tin, Or beautiful brown earthern pitcher. So pretty a neck, I'll be bound, Never join'd head and body together, Like nice crook'd-neck'd squash on the ground, Long whiten'd by winter-like weather. Should I set forth the rest of her charms, I might by some phrase that's improper, Give modesty's bosom alarms, Which I would n't do for a copper. Should I mention her gait or her air, You might think I intended to banter; She moves with more grace you would swear, Than a founder'd horse forced to a canter. She sang with a beautiful voice, Which ravish'd you out of your senses; A pig will make just such a noise When his hind leg stuck fast in the fence is. SIGNIOR SQUEAK'S DANCING ADVERTISEMENT.

Nota Bene—ladies grown, Said Signior waits upon alone, Teaching graces, arts, and airs, And other delicate affairs; How to look and act as prettily As belles of England, France, or Italy. JOHN BLAIR LINN THE POWERS OF GENIUS. The human fabric early from its birth Feels some fond influence from its parent earth: In different regions different forms we trace, Here dwells a feeble, there an iron race; Here genius lives and wakeful fancies play, Here noiseless stupor sleeps its life away. A rugged race the cliffs and mountains bear, They leap the precipice and breast the air, Follow the chamois on the pointed rock, And clamber heights to seek their bearded flock, Loud from the Baltic sounds the dreadful storm, And gathering hosts the face of day deform: Beneath their rage the soft Italian yields His boasted laurels and his blooming fields. The wandering Tartars by their rigorous land, Were led to war, to victory and command. While southern climes were sunk in deep repose, (An easy conquest to invading foes.) —Where spreads the quiet and luxuriant vale, For ever fann'd by spring's ambrosial gale; Where over pebbles runs the limpid rill, And woods o'ershade the wildly sloping hill: There roves the swain, all gentle and serene, And guards his sheep while browsing on the green. He leads the dance by Cynthia's silver light, And lulls with sport the dusky ear of night; Breathes from his pipe the dulcet strain of love, And warbles Ellen through the mead and grove. —In those drear climes where scorching suns prevail, And fever rides the tainted burning gale; Where draws the giant snake his loathsome train, And poisons with his breath the yellow plain; There languid pleasure waves his gilded wings, And slothful ease the mental power unstrings. Where Iceland spreads her dark and frozen wild On whose fell snows no cheering sunbeam smiled, There in their stormy, cold, and midnight cell, The cheerless fishermen with stupor dwell: Wrapt in their furs they slumber life away, And mimic with their lamps the light of day.— Chill through his trackless pines the hunter pass'd, His yell arose upon the howling blast: Before him fled, with all the speed of fear, His wealth and victim, yonder helpless deer. Saw you the savage man, how fell and wild, With what grim pleasure as he pass'd he smiled? Unhappy man! a wretched wigwam's shed Is his poor shelter, some dry skins his bed; Sometimes alone upon the woodless height He strikes his fire and spends his watchful night; His dog with howling bays the moon's red beam, And starts the wild-deer in his nightly dream— Poor savage-man, for him no yellow grain Waves its bright billows o'er the fruitful plain; For him no harvest yields its full supply When winter hurls his tempest through the sky. No joys he knows but those which spring from strife, Unknown to him the charms of social life. Rage, malice, envy, all his thoughts control, And every dreadful passion burns his soul.— Should culture meliorate his darksome home, And cheer those wilds where he is wont to roam; Beneath the hatchet should his forests fall And the mild tabor warble through his hall, Should fields of tillage yield their rich increase, And through his wastes walk forth the arts of peace; His sullen soul would feel a genial glow, Joy would break in upon the night of wo; Knowledge would spread her mild, reviving ray, And on his wigwam rise the dawn of day. JOHN SHAW. THE AUTUMNAL FLOWER. WRITTEN AT MALTA. Ah why, when all the scene around Has told approaching Winter nigh, When dark November's gloom has frown'd And sadden'd all the sickly sky; Ah why, soft flow'ret, dost thou dare Upon this bleak ascent to bloom? Thou com'st amid the dying year To waste, untimely, thy perfume. Thou shouldst have hail'd the vernal tide, When first the green bud clothed the plain, Or sought the breezy valley's side When Summer held his golden reign. Then many a morning's sunny sheen Had waked thee with soft magic spells, And many a dewy eve had seen Thee close, unhurt, thy tender bells. Soft fostering gales had made their care To chase each nipping frost away, And murmuring wild bees linger'd near Thy odors, all the joyful day. But Summer's golden reign is o'er, And genial Spring, long since, has flown; The wild bees murmur here no more, And every tepid gale is gone. Already, o'er the sea-girt hill, The blasts that lead the tempest blow; And lo! the frighten'd billows swell, And whiten all the shore below. Soft flower, thy fate the wanderer mourns, Who o'er these rocky summits strays, While eve with chilling damps returns And dims the sun's departing rays. Poor flower! before those rays once more Shall kindle up the tardy day, Thy life, thy fragrance shall be o'er, Thy simple beauties die away. No sunny morn shall call thee forth, Nor evening smile on thy repose; For dark and cold the coming North Bids all thy shrinking flow'rets close. In vain the radiant step of Spring Awakes the year e'er Autumn close; No vernal joys now spread the wing:— No—give me to my native snows! To these I go.—Farewell, sweet flower! Thou rocky, sea-girt isle, farewell! Where hostile strangers strive for power, And fear and superstition dwell. Yon vessel in the bay below Tomorrow bears me o'er the foam; And some returning morn shall show A land of freedom and a home. He said, and from the lonely height He turn'd, and downward bent his way; And sought, while darker grew the night, The ship at anchor in the bay. But many a sun shall seek the sea, And many a long, long night be o'er, Ere morn, returning, smile to see The wanderer on his native shore. SONG. Who has robb'd the ocean cave, To tinge thy lips with coral hue? Who from India's distant wave, For thee, those pearly treasures drew? Who, from yonder orient sky, Stole the morning of thine eye? Thousand charms, thy form to deck, From sea, and earth, and air are torn; Roses bloom upon thy cheek, On thy breath their fragrance borne. Guard thy bosom from the day, Lest thy snows should melt away. But one charm remains behind, Which mute earth can ne'er impart; Nor in ocean wilt thou find, Nor in the circling air a heart. Fairest! wouldst thou perfect be, Take, oh take that heart from me. WILLIAM LEIGH PIERCE THE YEAR. In all the varied change and state of life, The calm of solitude, or noisy strife, Man still is man, and read him as you will, Unstript, he stands the child of interest still; The wandering Tartar, and the swarthy Moor; The Parthian archer, and Norwegian boor; The booted Pole, whose birthright is his sword; The bearded Saxon, barter'd by his lord; The stubborn Russ, devoted to his czar; The crafty Frenchman, clamorous for war; The whisker'd Spaniard, solemn, grave, and sad; The Highland soldier, in his tartan plaid; The soft Italian, studious of wile; The generous Briton, faithful to his isle; The brave Columbian, freedom's favor'd son; All, all alike, the race of interest run. Seldom the wise man may expect to find That rich, rare diamond, an unbiass'd mind; Few, few are those whose pure, exalted hearts Are proof against corruption's cunning arts, Who act for others, not themselves alone, No pliant courtiers bending round a throne. In this drear age, when misery's cup o'erflows, When fate has loosed the train of human woes; In this drear age, which rouses virtue's fears, When intrigue triumphs o'er a world in tears; Thine too, my country, has high heaven decreed, Be the hard lot to suffer and to bleed. Alas! what crime has stern, unyielding fate, Doom'd all thy woes, dear land, to expiate? Columbia spurn'd at heaven's just decree, To idols bow'd, and bent her votive knee; In days of prosperous peace she swell'd with pride, And madly vain, eternal right defied; Behold her punishment, deception's art Has planted rankling sorrow in her heart; Outcasts and wretches, foster'd on her soil, Her riches plunder, load themselves with spoil, While virtue wandering through her ruin'd shore, Is left to batten on a meagre moor. Yet deeper grief her land is doom'd to bear; Her harvests smile, with each revolving year; Her wealth still grows beneath her careful hand. But grows, to glut intrigue's rapacious band; Prometheus thus, in fabled days of old, Crown'd with success, grew arrogant and bold; Braved heaven's high lord, with blest immortals strove, And raised his arm against the throne of Jove; The god enraged, with mighty vengeance hurl'd The daring miscreant to the nether world; In durance stretch'd, and bound with massy chains, Condemn'd to torment and eternal pains; On his torn breast a greedy vulture fares, Sucks the warm blood, the tender liver tears; In vain devours, in vain the torrent flows, Still, still, the bloody feast immortal grows. May heaven, all bounteous, with benignant hand, Shower choicest blessings o'er thee, dearest land! But, ah! be faithful to thyself the while, And guard against the arts of crafty wile; With harvest's sheaf her ruddy temples bound, Does not blithe Ceres cheerful smile around? Are not thy hills with verdant honors spread? Does not the oak thus warn thee from its shade? “Behold, Columbia, yon extended plain; Do all its luscious fruits thus blush in vain? Where is the hand that harvest to collect, Or where the force, such plenty to protect? Shall idle waste permit those fruits to die, Or fall to earth and there neglected lie? Cerulean waves old ocean stretches wide, Thy girting strands yet eager kiss his tide; Freight the blue billows of the roaring deep, Thy commerce loiters—lo! kind zephyrs sweep; Let me descend from every hill and plain And bear your produce o'er the briny main, To save your commerce from dark plunder's stroke Bid freedom's thunders clothe her native oak.” Alas, my country! why in darkness lay? Why close thine eyes and shun the dawning day? The gaunt wolf prowls, the tiger is abroad; The shepherds see their havoc, and applaud; Remember, oh, remember who have bled! Thy youth's defenders, stern oppression's dread. Dear was the treasure which your ransom bought, For many, and gallant, were the brave who fought; O, then respect thyself, thy rights preserve, Stand forth in vigor, swell each generous nerve; With high-soul'd honor raise the arm of force, Nor longer wayward tread a devious course; Arrest corruption, strip delusion bare, And drive the artful leopard from his lair; Behold thy sons in meanest bondage lie, Forge their own chains, for stripes and slavery sigh What magic charm, what incantation fell, Has mix'd the potion, wove the fatal spell? Is he less slave, who yields to wear the chain, While one, or while one thousand tyrants reign? Trust me, the difference is not vastly great If demagogues or despots rule a state; Self is the shrine where either basely bend; Self all the object, self the dearest friend. And are you free? behold your barter'd polls! Wisdom is silent—while intrigue cajoles. Hear yon unletter'd upstart coarsely bawl, He seeks your suffrage for the congress hall; What virtues brings he to that lofty seat? Deception's scholar, skill'd to cringe and cheat. He pours the whiskey in a copious flood, While reeling drunkards call him wise and good; Nay more, perhaps from distant lands he came, And sports the tinsel of a foreign name; Perhaps in France, with eager eyes, he saw Disorder triumph over prostrate law: Perhaps he heard around a bleeding queen, A nation shout, “God save the guillotine!” Perhaps he tells you with exulting smile, The rebel story of his dear green isle; Besides, Columbia's native sons are weak, Smite them on one, they turn the other cheek. Their recreant arms are quite unskill'd to wield The warrior's blade, and rule the battle field; Much prone to fear, the coward souls aspire No further than the cravings of desire; Illiterate they, in science dull and slow, So Europe says, and sure it must be so. LUCIUS M. SARGENT THE PLUNDERER'S GRAVE. Snow hides the green mountain, Beneath its white billow; And chill'd is the fountain, And leafless the willow: The tempest, loud swelling, Now drives along, dreary; Before the storm, yelling, The sea-mew flies, weary, And, cowering, seeks shelter, from ocean's wild roar. While billows are bounding, O'er rude rocks, surrounding The long sandy beach, and the craggy lee-shore. Where now does the bark ride, The wild water braving? Where now, o'er the dark tide, The gay streamer waving? And where now, so fearless, The mariner, helming, 'Mid clouds, dark and cheerless, And ocean o'erwhelming? Where now is the heart of that mariner brave? That bark is dismasted! That mariner blasted! That streamer has drunken the wild water-wave! O'er breakers, loud crashing, The waves fiercely bound her; While rude billows, dashing, In riot, roll round her. Go, helmsman, mid ocean, Thine arm now must save thee! Oh! kiss with devotion, The pledge, that she gave thee, Who ne'er may behold thee, her sailor, again! Think of her, who is dearest, When danger is nearest, Then plunge thy bold form, in the rough, rolling main! Now tall waves dash o'er him, Ah! vainly contending; Hope sinks fast, before him; His struggles are ending. Now, waves, gently growing, Seem rising to save him; Now, o'er the beach, flowing, More softly they lave him: His motionless corse, on the lone shore, they lay. Rude waves, loudly roaring, Along the strand, pouring, Now bear him again, o'er the watery way! Again rise the surges; Again they restore him: Again the wave urges Its refluence o'er him! Who, reckless of danger, Now braves, 'mid the ocean? How wild looks the stranger! How frantic his motion! He rescues the corse, from the rough rolling wave! The strand, for its pillow, From out the salt billow, He rescues the corse—but it is not to save! There stands, dark and lonely, The plunderer's dwelling; He seeks the strand only When sea-mews are yelling. When, 'mid the storm howling, No star is seen beaming, The wretch then is prowling; The false fire is gleaming, To lead the poor mariner, on to his doom! When waves bear him, senseless, He robs the defenceless, And plunges the corse, in the billowy tomb! The foul hearted demon, The sailor despoiling, Now rends, from the seaman, The fruit of his toiling! O'er wild ocean, braving, Hard earn'd was the treasure, Through tempest, loud raving; Though toiling was pleasure, For her, who was dear, to the mariner bold. The fierce hand, unsparing, Now rudely is tearing The poor humble garb from the corse that is cold! The pledge of devotion Thine arm still is wearing! That pledge, 'mid the ocean, Gave heart to thy daring. When eyes, brightly beaming, Have ever beset thee; When false fears were dreaming, Thy girl would forget thee; It brighten'd thy love, and it solaced thy fears: For, the girl, who was dearest, When danger was nearest, There bound the fair pledge, and bedew'd it with tears. The eye of the demon Glares, horrid, in pleasure; Poor, heart-sunken seaman! He grasps at thy treasure! And shall he bereave thee? Thy darling pledge sever? And cruelly leave thee? No, mariner, never! The tall wave indignantly rolls to the shore! The arm of the Thunderer Seizes the plunderer! Floods overwhelm him! he rises no more! The refluent billow Now leaves the beach, waveless; The flood is the pillow Of mariner, graveless. But, mark the wave, stranding, More boldly aspiring; The mariner landing, Then slowly retiring! The plunderer comes not along with the tide! The shark is heard, dashing, Amid the wave, splashing! The froth of the billow with crimson is dyed! While chill blasts are blowing, Who, o'er the corse, gazes? His garb, round it, throwing, The sailor he raises. From winds, cold and storming, The stranger has borne him; The blaze, kindly warming, To life, shall return him: The stranger shall aid him, the stranger defend. His pulse now is flowing, His bosom is glowing; He ne'er shall forget the poor mariner's friend. The white winter billow Has left the green mountain; Now leaves dress the willow; Now ripples the fountain. Where tempests were swelling, Soft breezes are sweeping, The sea-mew, late yelling, Is, 'neath the rock, sleeping; The sailor is far from the rough rolling main. The girl, that was dearest, When danger was nearest, Now holds to her bosom, her sailor again! WILLIAM RAY. TRIPOLI. Ye lurid domes! whose tottering columns stand, Marks of the despot's desolating hand: Whose weed-grown roofs and mouldering arches show The curse of tyranny, a nation's wo; In every ruin—every pile I find A warning lesson to a thoughtful mind. Your gloomy cells expressive silence break, Echo to groans, and eloquently speak; “The Christian's blood cements the stones he rears; This clay was moisten'd with a Christian's tears; Pale as these walls, a prisoner oft has lain, Felt the keen scourge and worn the ruthless chain; While scoffing foes increasing tortures pour, Till the poor victim feels, alas! no more!” Here thy brave tars, America, are found Lock'd in foul prisons and in fetters bound. Heavens! what sad times! must free Columbians bow Before yon tinsel tyrant's murky brow? Cringe to a power which death and rapine crown? Smile at a smile, and tremble at a frown? Kneel at a throne, its clemency implore, Enrich'd by spoils, and stain'd with human gore? Bear the sharp lash, the ponderous load sustain, Suppress their anger, and revenge restrain? Leave a free clime, explore the treacherous waves, The sport of miscreants and the slave of slaves? Heavens! at the sight each patriot bosom glows With virtuous hatred on its country's foes; At every blow indignant passions rise, And vengeance flashes from resentful eyes. But heaven is just, though man's bewilder'd mind To the dark ways of providence is blind; Else why are some ordain'd above the rest, Or villains treated better than the best? Why, martyr'd virtue, hang thy injured head? Why lived an Arnold, while a Warren bled? Earth's murderers triumph, proud oppressors reign, While patriots bleed, and captives sigh in vain? Yet slumbering justice soon shall wake and show Her sword, unsheath'd, aud vengeance wing the blow: Columbia's genius, glorious as the sun, With thy blest shade, immortal Washington! Unite to guard us from nefarious foes, And heaven defend, and angels interpose, Devoted tyrants cause just wrath to feel, Make Beys and Bashaws in submission kneel; Man's equal right, sweet liberty, restore, And despotism crush, to rise no more. THE WAY TO BE HAPPY. Do troubles overwhelm thy soul, Like billows of the ocean, That o'er the shipwreck'd victim roll, In terrible commotion; Seize bold Imagination's wing, And soar to heaven, so seeming, Or reign a potentate and king— 'T is all obtain'd by—dreaming. Do pain and poverty unite To rob thee of all pleasure— Like thieves break in at dead of night, And steal away thy treasure, The treasure of a tranquil mind With joy and rapture teeming, Seek—seek, my friend, and thou shalt find More solid joy in—dreaming. For let the world still darker frown Than night-clouds on creation, And shower its tenfold vengeance down, Its wrath and indignation, On this devoted head of mine, One star is still left gleaming, One light that will for ever shine— The hope—the bliss of dreaming. The world can neither give nor take Away these mental riches; They 're mine—and sleeping or awake, I love the little witches; They charm my senses to repose, While cares and wants are screaming My eyes and ears, to misery close, And give me peace in—dreaming. Whene'er I lay me down to rest, With toils and sorrows weary— A heart most feelingly distress'd, And all on earth looks dreary; Aerial powers around me throng, With light and glory beaming, And waft my raptured soul along The paradise of—dreaming. And oft as pensively I walk In solitary places, I hear celestial spirits talk, And think I see their faces; They bid me leave all earthly things, While tears of grief are streaming— I mount Imagination's wings, And find my heaven in—dreaming. VILLAGE GREATNESS. In every country village, where Ten chimney smokes perfume the air, Contiguous to a steeple, Great gentlefolks are found, a score, Who can't associate, any more, With common “country people.” Jack Fallow, born amongst the woods, From rolling logs, now rolls in goods, Enough awhile to dash on— Tells negro stories—smokes segars— Talks politics—decides on wars— And lives in stylish fashion. Tim Ox-goad, lately from the plough, A polish'd gentleman is now, And talks of “country fellows;” But ask the fop what books he 's read— You'll find the brain-pan of his head As empty as a bellows. Miss Faddle, lately from the wheel, Begins quite lady-like to feel, And talks affectedly genteel, And sings some tasty songs, too; But my veracity impeach, If she can tell what part of speech Gentility belongs to. Without one spark of wit refined, Without one beauty of the mind— Genius or education, Or family, or fame, to boast, To see such gentry rule the roast, Turns patience to vexation. To clear such rubbish from the earth, Though real genius—mental worth, And science to attend you, You might as well the sty refine, Or cast your pearls before the swine, They 'd only turn and rend you. WILLIAM CRAFTS RAPIDS IN LOVE. There are rapids in love, but they fall as they flow, Thus pleasure inhabits the bodies of wo, And the tears of their union though sunbeams illume, They meet in the rainbow, and part in the gloom. There are rapids in love, but they must be past o'er By those who will not be confined to the shore; Even danger has charms when it points to delight, And morning is lovelier for following night. Let us risk the descent—our barks shall combine, Our hopes and our hearts shall together incline: Love beckons us on to the perilous wave, One moment shall ruin us both, or shall save. Protect us, ye stars of the fond and the true, The dangers of lovers are sacred to you; The rapids are over,—surviving, secure, In the sea of delight our barks we will moor. SERENADE SONG. Beware the soft seducer; Elude his silken snare, And guard thy tender bosom From anguish and despair. Believe him not, young lady! Though by the stars he swear; The night is past! already The stars do disappear. But there is one remaining, The morning star alone, Just like a maid complaining When all her hopes are gone. SELLECK OSBORN. THE RUINS. I've seen, in twilight's pensive hour, The moss-clad dome, the mouldering tower, In awful ruin stand; That dome, where grateful voices sung, That tower, whose chiming music rung, Majestically grand! I 've seen, 'mid sculptured pride, the tomb Where heroes slept, in silent gloom, Unconscious of their fame; Those who, with laurel'd honors crown'd, Among their foes spread terror round, And gain'd—an empty name! I 've seen, in death's dark palace laid, The ruins of a beauteous maid, Cadaverous and pale! That maiden who, while life remain'd, O'er rival charms in triumph reign'd, The mistress of the vale. I 've seen, where dungeon damps abide, A youth, admired in manhood's pride, In morbid fancy rave; He who, in reason's happier day, Was virtuous, witty, nobly gay, Learn'd, generous and brave. Nor dome, nor tower, in twilight shade, Nor hero fallen, nor beauteous maid, To ruin all consign'd— Can with such pathos touch my breast As (on the maniac's form impress'd) The ruins of the mind! THE QUARRELS OF LOVE. Mark ye that cloud, whose sudden shade Succeeds the recent smile of morn; Such was the frown of my dear maid Whose early love was turn'd to scorn! Oh, how that frown did chill my heart, And quench my too presumptuous flame! Of my regret how keen the smart! How glow'd my burning cheek with shame! How could I, with unhallow'd lip, That bosom's purity profane? Or dare ambrosial sweets to sip, For which e'en love had sued in vain? Mark how that cloud, in drops of pearl, Dissolves, as sunshine breaks the while: So wept my kind, relenting girl, When penitence regain'd her smile. Mark, how that mild, cerulean hue, Expands, amidst retiring shade; 'T was thus her eye, of heavenly blue, All her returning love betray'd. Mark too, that bow, of splendid light, That bends o'er earth its graceful form, That shines so cheering to the sight, When bursting sunbeams chase the storm: As glows that signal, from above, Of promised peace 'tween man and heaven, So glow'd the blush of yielding love, While gently murm'ring, “thou 'rt forgiven. THE SAILOR. “The wary sea-bird screams afar— Along the wave dire omens sweep— From the veil'd sky no friendly star Beams on the undulating deep. Hark! from the cliffs of distant shores, The Lom emits his dismal cry— The wave portentous warning roars, And speaks the threatening tempest nigh. What guardian angel's watchful power Shall snatch me from the angry deep, Or bid, in that tremendous hour, The demon of the waters sleep? Or who, if on some desert wild I drift, weak, famished and distrest, Shall hush the sorrows of my child, Or soothe Lavinia's wounded breast? Sweet objects of my early love, For you with aching heart I mourn; Far from your peaceful vale I rove, Ah! hopeless ever to return! Yet, should it be my happy lot To hail again my native shore, Secure within my humble cot, I'll brave the restless deep no more.” His prayer was heard—the rolling bark Rode through the storm with stubborn pride; And William, blithe as morning lark, Flew to his sweet enraptured bride. Yet Will, with love and liquor warm, Ere yet a month had pass'd in glee, Forgot the terrors of the storm, And, singing, squared away for sea! WASHINGTON ALLSTON THE PAINT KING. Fair Ellen was long the delight of the young, No damsel could with her compare; Her charms were the theme of the heart and the tongue, And bards without number in ecstasies sung, The beauties of Ellen the fair. Yet cold was the maid; and though legions advanced, All drill'd by Ovidean art, And languish'd, and ogled, protested and danced, Like shadows they came, and like shadows they glanced From the hard polish'd ice of her heart. Yet still did the heart of fair Ellen implore A something that could not be found; Like a sailor she seem'd on a desolate shore, With nor house, nor a tree, nor a sound but the roar Of breakers high dashing around. From object to object still, still would she veer, Though nothing, alas, could she find; Like the moon, without atmosphere, brilliant and clear, Yet doom'd like the moon, with no being to cheer The bright barren waste of her mind. But rather than sit like a statue so still When the rain made her mansion a pound, Up and down would she go, like the sails of a mill, And pat every stair, like a woodpecker's bill, From the tiles of the roof to the ground. One morn, as the maid from her casement inclined, Pass'd the youth with a frame in his hand. The casement she closed—not the eye of her mind For, do all she could, no, she could not be blind; Still before her she saw the youth stand. “Ah, what can he do,” said the languishing maid, “Ah, what with that frame can he do?” And she knelt to the goddess of secrets and pray'd, When the youth pass'd again, and again he display'd The frame and a picture to view. “Oh, beautiful picture!” the fair Ellen cried, “I must see thee again or I die.” Then under her white chin, her bonnet she tied, And after the youth and the picture she hied, When the youth, looking back, met her eye. “Fair damsel,” said he, (and he chuckled the while) “This picture I see you admire: Then take it, I pray you, perhaps 't will beguile Some moments of sorrow; (nay, pardon my smile) Or, at least, keep you home by the fire.” Then Ellen the gift with delight and surprise From the cunning young stripling received. But she knew not the poison that enter'd her eyes, When sparkling with rapture they gazed on her prize— Thus, alas, are fair maidens deceived! 'T was a youth o'er the form of a statue inclined, And the sculptor he seem'd of the stone; Yet he languish'd as though for its beauty he pined, And gazed as the eyes of the statue so blind Reflected the beams of his own. 'T was the tale of the sculptor Pygmalion of old; Fair Ellen remember'd and sigh'd; “Ah, couldst thou but lift from that marble so cold, Thine eyes too imploring, thy arms should enfold, And press me this day as thy bride.” She said: when behold, from the canvas arose The youth, and he stepp'd from the frame: With a furious transport his arms did enclose The love-plighted Ellen: and, clasping, he froze The blood of the maid with his flame! She turn'd and beheld on each shoulder a wing. “Oh, heaven! cried she, who art thou?” From the roof to the ground did his fierce answer ring, As frowning, he thunder'd “I am the Paint-King! And mine, lovely maid, thou art now!” Then high from the ground did the grim monster lift The loud-screaming maid like a blast; And he sped though the air like a meteor swift, While the clouds, wand'ring by him, did fearfully drift To the right and the left as he pass'd. Now suddenly sloping his hurricane flight, With an eddying whirl he descends; The air all below him becomes black as night, And the ground where he treads, as if moved with affright, Like the surge of the Caspian bends. “I am here!” said the fiend, and he thundering knock'd At the gates of a mountainous cave; The gates open flew, as by magic unlock'd, While the peaks of the mount, reeling to and fro, rock'd Like an island of ice on the wave. “Oh, mercy!” cried Ellen, and swoon'd in his arms, But the Paint-King, he scoff'd at her pain. “Prithee, love,” said the monster, “what mean these alarms?” She hears not, she sees not the terrible charms, That work her to horror again. She opens her lids, but no longer her eyes Behold the fair youth she would woo; Now appears the Paint-King in his natural guise; His face, like a palette of villainous dies, Black and white, red, and yellow, and blue. On the skull of a Titan, that Heaven defied, Sat the fiend, like the grim giant Gog, While aloft to his mouth a huge pipe he applied, Twice as big as the Eddystone Lighthouse, descried As it looms through an easterly fog. And anon, as he puff'd the vast volumes, were seen, In horrid festoons on the wall, Legs and arms, heads and bodies emerging between, Like the drawing-room grim of the Scotch Sawney Beane, By the Devil dress'd out for a ball. “Ah me!” cried the damsel, and fell at his feet. “Must I hang on these walls to be dried?” “Oh, no!” said the fiend, while he sprung from his seat, “A far nobler fortune thy person shall meet; Into paint will I grind thee, my bride!” Then, seizing the maid by her dark auburn hair, An oil jug, he plung'd her within. Seven days, seven nights, with the shrieks of despair, Did Ellen in torment convulse the dun air, All cover'd with oil to the chin. On the morn of the eight, on a huge sable stone Then Ellen, all reeking, he laid; With a rock for his muller, he crush'd every bone, But, though ground to jelly, still, still did she groan; For life had forsook not the maid. Now reaching his palette, with masterly care Each tint on its surface he spread; The blue of her eyes, and the brown of her hair, And the pearl and the white of her forehead so fair, And her lips' and her cheeks' rosy red. Then, stamping his foot, did the monster exclaim, “Now I brave, cruel fairy, thy scorn!” When lo! from a chasm wide-yawning there came A light tiny chariot of rose color'd flame, By a team of ten glow-worms upborne. Enthroned in the midst on an emerald bright, Fair Geraldine sat without peer; Her robe was a gleam of the first blush of light, And her mantle the fleece of a noon-cloud white, And a beam of the moon was her spear. In an accent that stole on the still charmed air Like the first gentle language of Eve, Thus spake from her chariot the fairy so fair: “I come at thy call, but, oh Paint-King, beware, Beware if again you deceive.” “'T is true,” said the monster, “thou queen of my heart, Thy portrait I oft have essay'd; Yet ne'er to the canvas could I with my art The least of thy wonderful beauties impart; And my failure with scorn you repaid. “Now I swear by the light of the Comet-King's tail!” And he tower'd with pride as he spoke, “If again with these magical colors I fail, The crater of Etna shall hence be my jail, And my food shall be sulphur and smoke. “But if I succeed, then, oh, fair Geraldine! Thy promise with justice I claim, And thou, queen of fairies, shalt ever be mine, The bride of my bed; and thy portrait divine Shall fill all the earth with my fame.” He spake; when, behold, the fair Geraldine's form On the canvas enchantingly glow'd; His touches—they flew like the leaves in a storm; And the pure pearly white and the carnation warm Contending in harmony flow'd. And now did the portrait a twin-sister seem To the figure of Geraldine fair: With the same sweet expression did faithfully teem Each muscle, each feature; in short, not a gleam Was lost of her beautiful hair. 'T was the fairy herself! but, alas, her blue eyes Still a pupil did ruefully lack; And who shall describe the terrific surprise That seized the Paint-King when, behold, he descries Not a speck of his palette of black! “I am lost,” said the fiend, and he shook like a leaf; When, casting his eyes to the ground, He saw the lost pupils of Ellen with grief In the jaws of a mouse, and the sly little thief Whisk away from his sight with a bound. “I am lost!” said the fiend, and he fell like a stone; Then rising the fairy in ire With a touch of her finger she loosen'd her zone, (While the limbs on the wall gave a terrible groan,) And she swell'd to a column of fire. Her spear now a thunder-bolt flash'd in the air, And sulphur the vault fill'd around; She smote the grim monster; and now by the hair High-lifting, she hurl'd him in speechless despair Down the depths of the chasm profound. Then over the picture thrice waving her spear, “Come forth!” said the good Geraldine; When, behold, from the canvass descending, appear Fair Ellen, in person more lovely than e'er, With grace more than ever divine! WILLIAM MAXWELL THE REVERY. I am come to this sycamore tree, And lay myself down in its shade: The world has no pleasure for me; The hopes of my youth are betray'd. Flow on, thou sweet musical stream, My murmurs shall mingle with thine; My spirit is wrapt in a dream, The sadness I feel is divine. Hope took me, a gay little child, And soothed me to sleep on her breast And, like my own mother, she smiled O'er the dreams of my innocent rest. Then beauty came whispering sweet, Every word had a magical power; And pleasure, with eyes of deceit, Enticed me to enter her bower. There love show'd his glittering dart, Just bathed in the nectar of bees; While fancy persuaded my heart, That his only design was to please. And fame held her wreath of renown, All blooming with laurels divine; And promised the flourishing crown, To circle these temples of mine. Then I said to myself in my sleep, How lovely is all that I see! I shall never have reason to weep, For the world is a garden to me. But an angel came down from the skies, And claim'd me at once as her own; Fair truth shed her light on my eyes, And the shades of delusion are flown. I sigh for the dreams of my youth, All melted away into air; Yet say, that the sweet light of truth Betray my poor heart to despair? Ah no! I may mourn for awhile, Till my bosom is freed from its leaven; Then peace shall return with a smile, And faith wast my spirit to heaven. THE PRIZE. Clodpole, a simple rustic clown, Lived just a few miles out of town— The city's name? I wont be sure, I think though, it was Baltimore— An honest countryman by trade, Extremely clever with his spade, Could drive his plough off in a race, And plant potatoes with a grace. His wife too was a tidy soul, A thriving pair upon the whole. But times grew hard; Embargo came; Poor things! they did 'nt know who to blame. Some said, “the English are the cause:” Some said, “Red-Breeches—burn his laws!” But now a lottery appear'd! Poor Clodpole read the scheme and stared. For certainly the plan was great, And was n't it sanction'd by the state? He goes at once to buy a ticket, And begs the clerk to let him pick it; ('T was at the office kept by Waite, That is so truly fortunate;) Then looks and looks with all his eyes, And wisely thinks to choose the prize, And now all day he reads the scheme, And ev'ry night he dreams—a dream. He thought the money in his pocket, And bought a chest and key to lock it. At length the lottery is drawn. Clod hears the news, and he is gone. “My wife,” says he, “I'm off for town, To see if I am still a clown. So if you see me coming, Harriot, A sure 'nough great man in my chariot, Mind, see it well with both your eyes, You may be sure I 've got the prize. Then seize your longest-handled broom, And fly like lightning round the room; Break ev'rything you 've got—more too— And we'll buy everything that 's new. Yes! and I'll give you such a gown! Like Mrs Dashaway's in town.” He goes to town, or rather flies: “My ticket, Sir, is it a prize?” The clerk soon read the fellow through, And felt a little waggish too. So with a strange, mysterious look, He turns, and turns, and turns his book. “Your ticket, friend”—Clod stretch'd his eyes— “Has drawn—has drawn—” “what? what?”—“no prize But a dead blank!” Clod heard no more, But down he fell upon the floor. “A doctor! run! the man will die.” A doctor was just riding by; (These doctors are as thick as crows;) He smelt the carrion I suppose. He feels Clod's pulse, and shakes his head “It is a fit: he must be bled. His constitution though 's good stuff. I'll give him medicine enough. They'll cure him—if they should n't kill— At any rate they'll help the bill.” Out lancet, and he stuck a vein. The clown comes to himself again, And rolls around his wondering eyes, Like a wise owl, in great surprise. The doctor bears him off in haste To his own chariot, sees him placed, And bids the coachman drive him home. Dame Harriot sees the carriage come, “O! he has got the prize! we 're made! Good by t' ye to the hoe and spade!” Away she ran, and seized the broom, And flew like lightning round the room, Breaking up all she could get at— Except the jug—she could n't break that— A present from her mother Gray, And given her on her wedding day: There was none like it to be sold, And such fine beer as it would hold! But all the rest demolished quite, You never saw now such a sight. Just then poor Clodpole enters in: “Stop! stop!” he cries; “it is a sin. For mercy quit this foolish prank, He says my prize has drawn a blank.” See! there they stand as stiff as posts; And white as two meal-powder'd ghosts! At last Clod cries, “Give me a hug. I'm glad to find you 've saved the jug. Confound all lotteries, I say! Stick to the plough, and work away! Bad luck has made me monstrous wise, So, spite of chance, I 've got the prize.” TEA. Give me, give here my tea; Ladies' nectar! give it me; Sweet as what the Hummer sips, Or the dew on Beauty's lips. Tea 't is makes the spirits flow, Tickles up the heart of wo, Sets the tongue, enlivens wit, Gives the sweet poetic fit. Tea 't is makes the charming fair Sprightly, pleasing, as they are. What is more than all, 't was Tea, Tea, that set Columbia free. TO A FAIR LADY. Fairest, mourn not for thy charms, Circled by no lover's arms; While inferior belles, you see, Pick up husbands merrily. Sparrows when they choose to pair, Meet their matches anywhere; But the Phœnix, sadly great, Cannot find an equal mate. Earth, though dark, enjoys the honor Of a moon to wait upon her; Venus, though divinely bright, Cannot boast a satellite. ROBERT S. COFFIN SONG. Love, the leaves are falling round thee; All the forest trees are bare; Winter's snow will soon surround thee, Soon will frost thy raven hair: Then say, with me, Love, wilt thou flee, Nor wait to hear sad autumn's prayer? For winter rude Will soon intrude, Nor aught of summer's blushing beauties spare. Love, the rose lies withering by thee, And the lily blooms no more; Nature's charms will quickly fly thee, Chilling rains around thee pour: Oh, then with me, Love, wilt thou flee, Ere whirling tempests round thee roar, And winter dread Shall frost thy head, And all thy raven ringlets silver o'er? Love, the moon is shining for thee; All the lamps of heaven are bright; Holy spirits glide before thee, Urging on thy tardy flight; Then say, with me, Love, wilt thou flee, Nor wait the sun's returning light? Time's finger rude, Will soon intrude Relentless, all thy blushing beauties blight. Love, the flowers no longer greet thee, All their lovely hues are fled! No more the violet springs to meet thee, Lifting slow its modest head: Then say, with me, Love, wilt thou flee, And leave this darkling desert dread? And seek a clime Of joy sublime, Where fadeless flowers a lasting fragrance shed? WILLIAM B. WALTER ROMANCE. 'T is the last hour! far o'er the beetling steep, The glorious sun descends into the deep, And flings around a fiery flood of light, In farewell beams magnificently bright!— The shadowing clouds in mingled clusters driven, In lingering splendor float along the heaven: On roseate wings all softly now are stealing, Veil his bright beams then suddenly revealing; Tinging the towering cliffs and glowing skies, With radiant streaks of blue and purple dyes; While the long gleam that sweeps the crimson west, Traces the mighty limits of his rest. So sink the powerful, and the good of earth, From this fair world, that gloried in their birth! Their fame beams bright o'er death's dispersing gloom, And crowns with living light their hallow'd tomb! 'T is the last hour! and all around is still!— No murmur breaks on Calvary's lone hill!— Gihon's green banks and waves of heavenly blue, And vales and woods touch'd with a soften'd hue, Shine gladly forth, and greet the raptured view!— Hush'd is the fall of waters! evening's purple dew Is all around—the sweet flowers blossoming Droop their bright heads over the sacred spring! The high blue depths of air are silent now!— And spirits crowd along that mountain's brow!— Their rushing plumes are waving in the light, Spangled with stars, their waving tresses bright, Circled with diadems enwreath'd with flowers! They come in glory from immortal bowers; Hark!—'t is the music of a golden string, Swept by the sweet winds softly quivering! That trembles on the air with thrilling wing, And soothes the soul with its wild wandering! Like the loved hymn of early joys departed, That leaves the pilgrim almost broken-hearted; Too richly dear, its deep enchanting swell That has no name—but only breathes farewell!— 'T is gone!—and silent now the broad blue skies, Rolling in splendor as they gently rise! Soaring on radiant wings, far, far away! How solemnly beautiful departing day! And oh! how changed from that when Jesus died On that lone mountain's solitary side!— Thick clouds of darkness veil'd its hallow'd crest, And hovering lower'd upon its awful breast; Heavy and still the gathering volumes form; Hark! 't is the hollow muttering of the storm!— It comes at last, in gloom and wildering terror; The skies hang heavy like a mighty mirror, Despoil'd of all its splendor and its light! Dim crowding shapes are thronging down the night!— Redoubling peal on peal the thunder rolls, And rends the reddening vapor's bloody folds! Sudden and quick the lurid flashes driven In angry quiverings shot along the heaven, Shivering the foldings of that darksome shroud! Rent are the mountain rocks! earth shrieks aloud! The tempest winds are struggling fierce—and far Down the deep vale rolls on the fearful war! The volumed mass, all trembling, now receding, In wandering fires, high o'er the proud crest spreading In billowy flames! high on their flashing wings, Wrecks of old clouds and awful thunderings! And meteors stricken from the firmament Shower round their sulphurous rains!—in wild lament, Phantoms of light burst from the yawning earth On burning wings, the earthquake's wondrous birth!— The sun goes down in blood, and day is gone! Nature convulsive shakes, groans deep, 't is done! The whirlwinds rage, the graves give up their dead! Thousands of thunders roll! Where is that spirit fled? The godhead's power was there! and all was night! The godhead's power was there! and all was light!— Lo! rising from the shade of years, Visions of light are beaming! They pass away!—a host appears! How bright the visionary shapes are gleaming!— Hark!—'t is the trumpet clang!—the warrior band Sweep the dark waters for the holy land;— Knights, chieftains, paladins and kings! Amid ten thousand banner'd things! Bright gleam the far off spears—and golden armor ringing, Proud plumage waving, and red crosses flinging, Are all around, where upward they are winging, In pomp and pride of chivalry, Their streaming terrors to the sky!— And see, where burns the crescent high, Melting in clouds of purple dye! And gay pavilions proudly shine,— Gilded throne and gorgeous shrine Are stretched on Syria's strand! And there the Moslem banner throws, Its threatening folds to coming foes!— See the Saracen lines are unveiled, and display, The burning crests of their long array, And glance in fearful light,—the sun's last trembling ray! Hear ye no cry on Gaza's shore?— No victor shout, no battle roar?— The ringing trump come piercingly— On the startled ear, and the hoarse war cry! The peal of drum rolling deeply on! The war horn's din, and gonfalon; Saw ye no flash of the scimetar's wave, As it fell on the crests of the warrior brave?— The crimson plume mingling with crescent of light; The struggles of death in the heat of the fight! Where the wild war horse trampled over the dead, And crush'd out the souls of the living,—and fled? His fetlocks all gory, and ghastly his eye!— And the groan and the curse, and the horrible yell Of the victor and vanquish'd, like spirits of hell From their chains unbound and warring high, Shrieking out the long curse of their agony!— Banners are spread on the mountain rock! Dark shadows are melting! and lo! there 's a shock, And the battle is ending!—a loud stirring cry Swells on the cloud wind exultingly!— The dark volumed smoke rolls awfully there! Livid flashes of light through its canopy glare! Like meteor flame in the stormy air— Million of shafts giving dreadful token! Spears kindling along! all bloody and broken!— Like the angry clouds of the lowering morn! Wildly they rush through the smoke and flame, Fighting to win a glorious name, Or lonely there to die! Whence is that form that comes terribly on? With a helmet of light—in the dark battle won. In the splendor of youth! it is vanish'd and gone! O, gone for aye in the whirlwind breath Of the spirit that rides on the clouds of death! His white courser plunging with terrible wrath And leaping along the encumber'd path!— His rider he drags o'er the carnage ground; Still muttering out an encouraging sound, And waving in vain—his broken sabre round; His bosom gore stained with a sabre wound! In vain! the scimetars are nearer clashing!— And arms of blood—like death stars flashing! Rolling of drums, and shrieks for life! The earthquake motion of the strife!— And hark! a fearful pause in that din profound! The dark fight deepens, and gathers round! The red cross banners are up on the gale! And their floating is like the shattered sail Of the proud ship wreck'd by the ocean storm! Some frigate of air, of the bravest form, Flashing in blood, by the thunder torn!— How they hurry along; by their flight upborne! The crescents are down! there are suns in the sky! And hark! the glad shout of victory!— Dark as the wave when spectres lower And shroud the deep at midnight hour!— Thick as the leaves when autumn tide, Has reft the forest of its pride! Swift as the clouds by whirlwinds driven Far—far along the troubled heaven! The glorious vision pass'd! Red ruin grasped his scythe, and strode along the waste!— The moon rides high in heaven; the stars are bright Along the azure depths, shedding a timid light! Who has not felt the mysteries of night? Yea! there is something hallow'd in this hour, When the mind wanders in its newborn power, Far from the things of earth to things above, And worships in the world of holiness and love!— In regions pure, where veil'd archangels dwell, Circling the eternal front of life ineffable!— Sometimes we wander to the fairy land, Where the soul dances and her wings expand! Fair land!—all brighten'd o'er with turf and flowers, And dewy shrubbery, and moonlight bowers, Retreat of fancy's glittering vagrant powers. Fair heaven!—where many color'd clouds enfold, Bright islets floating in the sea of gold! Proud domes and palaces are shining there, With ivory columns, gemm'd with fire-stain'd spar! There wanton zephyrs dance on budding flowers, And waft the fragrant leaves in snowy showers;— By sunny banks the silver waters whirl A wildering music o'er their sands of pearl!— And birds are singing from their star-lit bowers, To lull the sleeping of the blue eyed hours! Light things are flitting in this world of air! Gay creatures born of thought, are dwelling there!— The elfin race, who bathe in dews of morn! And climb the rainbow of the summer storm!— Floating about, in thinnest robes of light, From meteors caught, that shoot along the night. Crowns, studded o'er with gems, their brows adorn, Stole from the eyelids of the waking morn!— They wave bright sceptres, wrought of moonlight beams, And spears of crystal, tinged with lightning gleams!— Young naked Loves are sporting on the main, Or glide on clouds along the ethereal plain! Their snowy breasts floating the waves among, Are kiss'd by shapes of light, and swim along In liquid sapphire—with their humid locks Dropping thick diamonds o'er their mossy rocks!— The sea-green realm is all with emeralds shining, With rainbow arches o'er the depths reclining!— And other skies are deeply rolling under, With clouds of trembling flame and slumbering thunder! And minstrels blow their horns of tulip flowers! In echoes softly from their air-borne towers, Floats back the music, with a dreamy sound! A dove-wing'd presence, hovering round and round!— Visions of joy! in sun-robe garments sporting, Dear Loves! with gay looks in green pathways courting! Who speak with eyes, and move with steps of sadness, And now, we list a cheerful song of gladness! RICHARD DABNEY THE SPRING OF LIFE. 'T is not enough that virtue sways Our present hours and passing days; 'T is not enough, our purpose be From every base intention free; All that polluted life's first source Will float along its downward course, And dark shall be each future year, Unless the spring of life is clear. Though words of truth eternal say, Repentance washes guilt away; If former times display a stain, The future shall the blot retain; The hue and color of the past Upon the coming hour is cast; And dark shall be each future year, Unless the spring of life be clear. O then, upon those future years, Bestow not agony and tears! Though all thy sins shall be forgiven, And blotted from the book of heaven; Their shades shall flit around, and fling Dark horror from their raven wing; And bitter be each future year, Unless the spring of life is clear. In early life when trusting youth Thinks all is goodness, worth, and truth; A holy inmate charms man's breast, And lulls its many woes to rest. It watches o'er his pillow'd head, And lures sweet slumbers to his bed; It adds fresh charms to morning's ray, And guards him through the eventful day— No might, but his, can bid depart, That holy inmate from his heart— 'T is stainless conscience—boon of heaven, To man, for heavenly purpose, given. But when amidst the world he roves, And that he ought to hate, he loves, Unheeded pass its frequent cries, The holy inmate quickly dies; But oft within the varying scene, When thought his follies wakes between; But oft within the gloom of night, Its shade, avenging, meets his sight— Comes, deck'd with all the warmth of youth, When life was love, and peace, and truth, Comes, deck'd with all the charms that blest, In early life, his guiltless breast. It smiles—in fancied view, appears, The virtuous bliss of youthful years; It frowns—before his blasted eyes, His present vices hideous rise. A WESTERN WAR SONG. To the north-western wilds, has our gallant youth gone— Though his breast, with a tempest of feeling, was torn, Yet he scorn'd a weak tear, and disdained a weak sigh— He is wedded to vengeance, or bounden to die, For the horror-fraught fate of the victim so dear To the heart of the hero, the brave volunteer. On his dauntless steed borne, he hastens to ride, On his shoulder his rifle, his sword by his side— O'er rivers, through forests, like the swift wind he flies To the sounds, that he pants for, the battle-field's cries. For wedded to vengeance, and stranger to fear, Is the heart of the hero, the brave volunteer. Hurra, at Moravia, that battle-cry wakes, From the ranks the dire peal of the musketry breaks. The brave volunteer, 'midst the death-flashing cloud, Invokes the dear name of the murdered, aloud; Then quick to the charge, with his death-dealing blow, Pours his wrath on the friends of the hatchet and bow. For wedded to vengeance, a stranger to fear, Is the soul of the hero, the brave volunteer. At that dread hour of night, when his cherish'd love bled, And her mangled form slept with the massacred dead, He had sworn a dread oath, that his rifle and steel, On the merciless demons, deep vengeance should deal, For the horror-fraught fate of the victim so dear To the heart of the hero, the brave volunteer. Then joy to the brave volunteer, who has sped To the wilds of the north-west, where thousands have bled, Who, wedded to vengeance, a dread oath has sworn, On the arms of his comrades, a corse to be borne; Or the deep debt of vengeance in tenfold to deal On the merciless fiends, with his rifle and steel, For the soul-harrowing scathe of the victim so dear To the heart of the hero, the brave volunteer. THE HEROES OF THE WEST. How sweet is the song of the festal rite, When the bosom with rapture swells high; When the heart, at the soft touch of pleasure, beats light, And bright is the beam of the eye. In the dirge, that is pour'd o'er affection's bier, How holy an interest dwells, When the frequent drop of the frequent tear, The heart-rending anguish tells; But sweeter the song that the minstrel should raise To the patriot victor's fame, And livelier the tones of the heart-gender'd praise, That should wake from the harp at his name: But holier the dirge that the minstrel should pour O'er the fallen hero's grave, Whose arm wields the sword for his country no more, Who has died the death of the brave. There lives in the bosom a feeling sublime; Of all, 't is the strongest tie; Unvarying through every change of time, And only with life does it die. 'T is the love that is borne for that lovely land, That smiled on the hour of our birth; 'T is the love, that is planted by nature's hand, For our sacred native earth. 'T was this that the patriot victor inspired, Was strong in the strength of his arm, With the holiest zeal his brave bosom fired, And to danger and death gave a charm. 'T was this that the dying hero blest, And hallow'd the hour when he fell, That throbb'd in the final throb of his breast, And heaved in his bosom's last swell: When a thousand swords, in a thousand hands, To the sunbeams of heaven shone bright; When the willing hearts of Columbia's bands, Were firm for Columbia's right; When the blood of the west, in the battle was pour'd, In defence of the rights of the west; When the blood of the east stain'd the point of the sword, At the Eastern king's behest: Till the angel form of returning peace, O'er the plain and the mountain smiled— Bade the rude blast of war from its ravage to cease, And the sweet gale of plenty breathe mild. She smiled—and the nation's mighty woes Ceased to stream from the nation's eyes; She smiled—and a fabric of wisdom arose, And exalted its fame to the skies. Then firm be its base, as the giant rock 'Midst the ocean waves alone, That the beating rain and the tempest shock, For numberless years has borne. And blasted the parricide arm, that shall plan That glorious structure's fall; But still may it sanction the rights of man, And liberty guardian to all. Then sweet be the song that the minstrel should raise, To the patriot victor's fame, And lively the tones of the heart-gender'd praise, That should wake from the harp at his name. Then holy the dirge that the minstrel should pour, O'er the fallen hero's grave, Whose hand wields the sword for his country no more, Who has died the death of the brave. TURN NOT TO THE EAST. Can the heart, which first glow'd in a far foreign seat, For a different land feel its warm pulses beat? Can the eye, oped not here, prop the heart-gender'd tear On the blood that was spilt for the blessings we bear? Turn not to the East with the eye of desire, Turn not to the East like the sect'ry of fire; For the wind of the East in its poison'd gale brings The fell breath of despots, and curses of kings. See the star of the West in its mild glories rise, See the star of the West tread its path in the skies: How sweet is the sight, while its soft radiance beams On my native land's hills, and my native land's streams. That star, when the proud boasting sons of the East Have danced through their day, and have finish'd their feast— That star then shall shine over millions more blest, In the realms doom'd to rise in the wilds of the West. Then look to the Eastern horizon's blue bound, As if past its precincts no mortal is found; Then look to the Eastern horizon's red light, As if past its rays brood oblivion and night. Can the heart, which first glow'd in a far foreign seat, For a different land feel its warm pulses beat? Can the eye, oped not here, drop the heart-gender'd tear, On the blood that was spilt for the blessings we bear? TO A LADY. Lady, that form so slight and fair Was, surely, never framed to bear The season's change, the hand of pain, And fell disease's racking train, That must, from year to year, attend Life's course, till life itself shall end. That heart, so pure, so soft, so good, That scarce has yet a pang withstood, Was, surely, never meant to bear Grief, sorrow, wo, deceit, despair, And all the mental ills, that rend The human heart, till life shall end. Some happy island far removed, Whose groves of bliss an angel loved, Where winter's gloom was never known, Nor fell disease's hollow groan; Where grief, deceit, despair and wo Dare not their forms of horror show, Lady, was placed thy destined lot— But fate, that destiny forgot; Or, envious of thy blissful state, Some fiend of earth, and earthly hate, Gave thee to pain and sorrow here— Betray'd thee to this world of care. WASHINGTON IRVING THE FALLS OF THE PASSAIC. In a wild, tranquil vale, fringed with forests of green, Where nature had fashion'd a soft, sylvan scene, The retreat of the ring-dove, the haunt of the deer, Passaic in silence roll'd gentle and clear. No grandeur of prospect astonish'd the sight, No abruptness sublime mingled awe with delight; Here the wild flow'ret blossom'd, the elm proudly waved, And pure was the current the green bank that laved. But the spirit that ruled o'er the thick tangled wood, And deep in its gloom fix'd his murky abode, Who loved the wild scene that the whirlwinds deform, And gloried in thunder, and lightning, and storm; All flush'd from the tumult of battle he came, Where the red men encounter'd the children of flame, While the noise of the war-whoop still rang in his ears, And the fresh bleeding scalp as a trophy he bears: With a glance of disgust, he the landscape survey'd, With its fragrant wild flowers, its wide waving shade;— Where Passaic meanders through margins of green, So transparent its waters, its surface serene. He rived the green hills, the wild woods he laid low; He taught the pure stream in rough channels to flow; He rent the rude rock, the steep precipice gave, And hurl'd down the chasm the thundering wave Countless moons have since roll'd in the long lapse of time— Cultivation has softened those features sublime; The axe of the white man has lighten'd the shade, And dispell'd the deep gloom of the thicketed glade. But the stranger still gazes, with wondering eye, On the rocks rudely torn, and groves mounted on high; Still loves on the cliff's dizzy borders to roam, Where the torrent leaps headlong embosom'd in foam. HENRY T. FARMER THE BATTLE OF THE ISLE. A COMICO-TRAGICAL TALE. PART I.—THE ISLE. On the verge of the deep, where the dark sea-bird hovers, Where the wave, in loud fury, bursts wild on the shore; Near the light-house, whose flame to the wanderer discovers A beam, like the glance of those long-sever'd lovers, Who meet in blest rapture, to sever no more; An isle of white sand, like a desert is seen, Where no wild flower blushes in meadow of green; But, where long tangled sea-weed is cast on the strand, Like the gray locks of age, pluck'd by merciless hand; For the storm tore it up from its deep oozy bed, As the ruffian tears locks from the wanderer's head: Oh! ye who would view “this famed desert” aright, Go visit the strand by the “pale starry light;” When the bleak wind is high, and the breakers are gleaming, And the owl is abroad, and the sea-gull is screaming; Then, sit near yon circummured castle awhile, And behold the fell grandeur of Sullivan's isle. The moonbeam just gleams on yon ruin so bare, One moment the moonbeam has fled; Like the quick frantic smile on the face of despair, When she bends o'er the couch of the dead. Oft to visit this spot a blest seraph is seen, With an eye ever bright, and a robe ever green, And a cheek, where the red rose for ever must bloom: And she covers with daisies the path to the tomb; The youth that she smiles on is certainly blest, He has strength for the chase, and fair visions for rest; I have wiped the big drops from a brow cold as stone, But I have seldom seen health on her diamond throne. Far famed was the castle, now lost in decay, That frown'd o'er the high surging sea; Though pale is the blood-stain, and long past the day, Still, who has not heard of that noble affray, And its banner, the green island tree? PART II.—THE NIGHT. In bugle bed-gown frown'd the night, Like angry witch with baneful spite; She scarce allow'd the stars to light The sandy hills around. The moon, 't is thought, was fast asleep, In distant cavern dark and deep, Where silence doth her vigils keep, In mystery profound. The stricken drum announced the hour, The sentry paced round fosse and tower, And fearing much a drenching shower, Around his watch-coat drew: A sudden sorrow fill'd his mind, His memory, with hint unkind, Spoke of past times, and he repined His coat was now not new. Ah! little did that watchman dream Of battle field e'er morning beam, Of noisy shout and piercing scream, From virgin beauty fair; Or he had bow'd his lofty crest, And wiped his eyes, and smote his breast, And 'gainst his brow steel gauntlet press'd, In token of despair. Now arm in arm, or hand in hand, Two knights pass'd slowly o'er the strand, Unarm'd with battle-axe or brand, Or faulchion broad, or spear: Anon they stopp'd before the tower, Where fair Floressa A rich widow. slept in bower, Far from enchanter's baneful power, Or haggard wizard drear. “I know this beauteous virgin rare, And by yon vaulted arch I swear, A foot more light, a face more fair, And 'sooth an eye more bright, On earth before has never been, And she yclept the fairy queen By wilder'd knight or damsel seen, Would wither in her sight. Let poet Spenser deftly tell, Of Britomart and Florimel, And loudly wild his numbers swell; In either damsel's praise: Or e'en let Ariosto rear A trophy to Marphisa's spear, Or Tasso crown his virgin dear With never-fading bays: For these must bow before her shrine, And e'en the Amazon divine, Who tasted Alexander's wine, And Joan of Arc beside.” Thus spoke the foremost knight, and strode In silence o'er the sandy road, That led toward her blest abode; The gate flew open wide. PART III.—THE VISIT. Slow o'er the platform paced a knight, The hero of the piece, who kept livery stables. In glittering vest and armor dight; High on his helm, like passing cloud, With awful nod, a horsetail bow'd. 'T was said by Douglas, in his pride, “Right fairly” doth Lord Marmion ride; To give this mailed chief his due, He rode as well and fairly too. The steed Bucephalus of yore, Triumphant through the battle bore Great Philip's son, in warlike pride; 'T is said, when that famed stallion died, The monarch many a tear-drop shed, And built a city o'er his head: Our chief, for love of faithful steed, Had done almost as good a deed; To build a city, though not able, He built, 't was all he could—a stable. The knights Two officers belonging to the United States army. who to the gateway came, Call'd on Floressa's honor'd name, Saying, within that lady's bower, They came to spend a short half hour. The mailed chieftain, turning, said, “That lady bright has gone to bed:” The knight his manly port admired, And bowing—would have soon retired; When quick they heard a mighty jar, A tumult wild, a din of war: High on the castle's slanting stair, Appear'd the form of female fair; Wild was her look with haggard fright, Her hair was loose, her dress was white: Down—down she swept, like fell Simoom, Left all her armor in her room, Toss'd from her eyes the flowing hair, Brandish'd her stalwart arm in air; And thus 'midst thunders, fire, and smoke, That tender, lovely virgin spoke. PART IV.—THE BATTLE. “Hold! thieves and murderers, on your lives, Bring pistols, scissors, carving knives, And shed their impious gore:” She caught the foremost by his coat, Grasp'd with her sinewy hand his throat, To dash him on the floor; “A knife, a knife, fly quickly, fly, Attack the villains or I die. What, pistols, ho! is no one nigh? Quick, minion, on thy life; My castle for a gleaming steel, To make those damned robbers feel The deadly blow this arm can deal; My kingdom for a knife!!— Fire quick”—a flash beam'd ruddy bright, A bullet took its erring flight From smoking petronel. Death now appear'd to call his court, For soon, as if in playful sport, A seeming victim fell. “Off, from my hall, you scoundrels base, Let no one longer show his face, This is my own domain and place, Let no damn'd slave deride it; Who dares among you all to frown? I paid in yonder distant town, Each farthing of the money down, The very hour I buy'd it. Down with the huge portcullis straight, Go, quick as lightning shut the gate, The lowly villains bind;” With that, she gave a hearty damn To either knight, the gate goes slam, And one remains behind: Gleam'd in her hand the pointed knife, 'T is aim'd at that lone captive's life, With many a deadly thrust; The servants shudder with affright, For never was a mortal wight So handled, and so cursed. Against such gentleness, such charms, What knight could wield his missile arms? Sure all must be subdued! And he who tarried in her hold, And saw her meek demeanor bold, In cool amazement stood!!— The chieftain with the waving crest Felt some compunction in his breast, And oped the gate again; From whence the captive soon withdrew, And oaths like hailstones after flew In Eleusinian strain. Thus ended, without blood or spoil, The battle's rage and loud turmoil, And imprecations vile; From hence ye warriors all beware, Still ponder on that lady fair, And ever in your memories bear, The battle of the isle. JAMES K. PAULDING THE BACKWOODSMAN. 'T was sunset's hallow'd time—and such an eve Might almost tempt an angel heaven to leave. Never did brighter glories greet the eye, Low in the warm and ruddy western sky: Nor the light clouds at summer eve unfold More varied tints of purple, red, and gold. Some in the pure, translucent, liquid breast Of crystal lake, fast anchor'd seem'd to rest, Like golden islets scatter'd far and wide, By elfin skill in fancy's fabled tide, Where, as wild eastern legends idly feign, Fairy, or genii, hold despotic reign. Others, like vessels gilt with burnish'd gold, Their flitting airy way are seen to hold, All gallantly equipp'd with streamers gay, While hands unseen, or chance directs their way; Around, athwart, the pure ethereal tide, With swelling purple sail, they rapid glide, Gay as the bark, where Egypt's wanton queen Reclining on the shaded deck was seen, At which as gazed the uxorious Roman fool, The subject world slipt from his dotard rule. Anon, the gorgeous scene begins to fade, And deeper hues the ruddy skies invade; The haze of gathering twilight nature shrouds, And pale, and paler, wax the changeful clouds. Then sunk the breeze into a breathless calm, The silent dews of evening dropt like balm; The hungry nighthawk from his lone haunt hies, To chase the viewless insect through the skies; The bat began his lantern-loving flight, The lonely whip-poor-will, our bird of night, Ever unseen, yet ever seeming near, His shrill note quaver'd in the startled ear; The buzzing beetle forth did gaily hie, With idle hum, and careless blundering eye; The little trusty watchman of pale night, The fire-fly trimm'd anew his lamp so bright, And took his merry airy circuit round The sparkling meadow's green and fragrant bound, Where blossom'd clover, bathed in balmy dew, In fair luxuriance, sweetly blushing grew. Now all through Pennsylvania's pleasant land, Unheeded pass'd our little roving band, —For every soul had something here to do, Nor turn'd aside our cavalcade to view— By Bethlehem, where Moravian exiles 'bide, In rural paradise, on Lehigh's side, And York and Lancaster—whose rival rose In this good land, no bloody discord knows. Not such their fate!—the ever grateful soil Rewards the blue-eyed German's patient toil; Richer and rounder every year he grows, Nor other ills his stagnant bosom knows Than caitiff grub, or cursed Hessian fly, Mildews, and smuts, a dry or humid sky; Before he sells, the market's sudden fall, Or sudden rise, when sold—still worse than all! Calmly he lives—the tempest of the mind, That marks its course by many a wreck behind; The purpose high that great ambition feels, Sometimes perchance upon his vision steals, But never in his sober waking thought One stirring, active impulse ever wrought. Calmly he lives—as free from good as blame, His home, his dress, his equipage the same, And when he dies, in sooth, 't is soon forgot What once he was, or what he once was not— An honest man, perhaps,—'t is somewhat odd, That such should be the noblest work of God! So have I seen in garden rich and gay, A stately cabbage waxing fat each day; Unlike the lively foliage of the trees, Its stubborn leaves ne'er wave in summer breeze, Nor flower, like those that prank the walks around, Upon its clumsy stem is ever found; It heeds not noontide heats, or evening's balm, And stands unmoved in one eternal calm. At last, when all the garden's pride is lost, It ripens in drear autumn's killing frost, And in a savory sourkrout finds its end, From which detested dish, me heaven defend! Our Basil beat the lazy sun next day, And bright and early had been on his way, But that the world he saw e'en yesternight, Seem'd faded like a vision from his sight. One endless chaos spread before his eyes, No vestige left of earth or azure skies, A boundless nothingness reign'd everywhere, Hid the green fields, and silent all the air. As look'd the traveller for the world below, The lively morning breeze began to blow, The magic curtain roll'd in mists away, And a gay landscape laugh'd upon the day. As light the fleeting vapors upward glide, Like sheeted spectres on the mountain side, New objects open to his wondering view Of various form, and combinations new. A rocky precipice, a waving wood, Deep winding dell, and foaming mountain flood, Each after each, with coy and sweet delay, Broke on his sight, as at young dawn of day, Bounded afar by peak aspiring bold, Like giant capt with helm of burnish'd gold. So when the wandering grandsire of our race On Ararat had found a resting place, At first a shoreless ocean met his eye, Mingling on every side with one blue sky; But as the waters, every passing day, Sunk in the earth, or roll'd in mists away, Gradual, the lofty hills, like islands, peep From the rough bosom of the boundless deep, Then the round hillocks, and the meadows green, Each after each, in freshen'd bloom are seen, Till, at the last, a fair and finish'd whole Combined to win the gazing patriarch's soul. Yet oft he look'd, I ween, with anxious eye, In lingering hope somewhere, perchance, to spy, Within the silent world, some living thing, Crawling on earth, or moving on the wing, Or man, or beast—alas! was neither there, Nothing that breathed of life in earth or air; 'T was a vast silent mansion rich and gay, Whose occupant was drown'd the other day; A church-yard, where the gayest flowers oft bloom Amid the melancholy of the tomb; A charnel house, where all the human race Had piled their bones in one wide resting place; Sadly he turn'd from such a sight of wo, And sadly sought the lifeless world below. Now down the mountain's rugged western side, Descending slow, our lonely travellers hied, Deep in a narrow glen, within whose breast The rolling fragments of the mountain rest; Rocks tumbled on each other, by rude chance, Crown'd with grey fern, and mosses, met the glance, Through which a brawling river braved its way, Dashing among the rocks in foamy spray. Here, 'mid the fragments of a broken world, In wild and rough confusion, idly hurl'd, Where ne'er was heard the woodman's echoing stroke, Rose a huge forest of gigantic oak; With heads that tower'd half up the mountain's side. And arms extending round them far and wide, They look'd coeval with old mother earth, And seem'd to claim with her an equal birth. There, by a lofty rock's moss-mantled base, Our tired adventurers found a resting place; Beneath its dark, o'erhanging, sullen brow, The little bevy nestled snug below, And with right sturdy appetite, and strong, Devour'd the rustic meal they brought along. The squirrel eyed them from his lofty tree, And chirp'd as wont, with merry morning glee; The woodcock crow'd as if alone he were, Or heeded not the strange intruders there, Sure sign they little knew of man's proud race In that sequester'd mountain 'biding place; For wheresoe'er his wandering footsteps tend, Man never makes the rural train his friend; Acquaintance that brings other beings near, Produces nothing but distrust or fear: Beasts flee from man the more his heart they know, And fears, at last, to fix'd aversion grow, As thus in blithe serenity they sat, Beguiling resting time with lively chat, A distant, half heard murmur caught the ear, Each moment waxing louder, and more near, A dark obscurity spread all around, And more than twilight seem'd to veil the ground, While not a leaf e'en of the aspin stirr'd, And not a sound but that low moan was heard. There is a moment when the boldest heart That would not stoop an inch to 'scape death's dart, That never shrunk from certain danger here, Will quail and shiver with an anguish fear; 'T is when some unknown mischief hovers nigh, And heaven itself seems threatening from on high. Brave was our Basil, as became a man, Yet still his blood a little cooler ran, 'Twixt fear and wonder, at that murmur drear, That every moment wax'd more loud and near. The riddle soon was read—at last it came, And nature trembled to her inmost frame; The forest roar'd, the everlasting oak, In writhing agonies the storm bespoke, The live leaves scatter'd wildly everywhere, Whirl'd round in maddening circles in the air, The stoutest limbs were scatter'd all around, The stoutest trees a stouter master found, Crackling, and crashing, down they thundering go, And seem to crush the shrinking rocks below: Then the thick rain in gathering torrents pour'd, Higher the river rose, and louder roar'd, And on its dark, quick eddying surface bore The gather'd spoils of earth along its shore, While trees that not an hour before had stood The lofty monarchs of the stately wood, Now whirling round and round with furious force, Dash 'gainst the rocks that breast the torrent's force, And shiver like a reed by urchin broke, Through idle mischief, or with heedless stroke; A hundred cataracts, unknown before, Rush down the mountain's side with fearful roar, And as with foaming fury down they go, Loose the firm rocks and thunder them below; Blue lightnings from the dark cloud's bosom sprung, Like serpents, menacing with forked tongue, While many a sturdy oak that stiffly braved The threatening hurricane that round it raved, Shiver'd beneath its bright resistless flash, Came tumbling down amain with fearful crash. Air, earth, and skies, seem'd now to try their power, And struggle for the mastery of the hour; Higher the waters rose, and blacker still, And threaten'd soon the narrow vale to fill. PAUL ALLEN. NOAH. CANTO. II. The sun had sunk behind the watery waste, When night's pale regent, beautiful and chaste, With silent footsteps stole upon the sight, As fearful to awake the dreams of night; Calmly she mounted up the azure plain, With all her twinkling vassals in her train; Cloud after cloud, in long fantastic chase, Sweep in succession o'er her pallid face; But she still travelling up the blue serene, Holds her calm course, and lifts her light between, Till, by no intervening shade o'ercast, She gives a steady settled ray at last: The treacherous deep, so late by tempests worn, And storms, as if by human passions torn, Now like a blessed spirit, once forgiven, Reflects the pure and sacred light of heaven. The ark, now gliding under easy sail, Urged by the pressure of a gentle gale, While no rude breath of wind the prospect mars, Moves o'er a liquid firmament of stars. At length she rests—but with a shock so light, That not a single slumberer of the night Wakes from his dream. At morn's returning ray Shem oped the window to behold the day; He gazed around, and o'er his head was seen The smiling olive, with its leaf of green. “Father, come forth!” he cries, with heart elate, “For now the waters do indeed abate.” Strange to relate, in these unthinking times, The traveller, while exploring distant climes, Leaves thee, O Ararat! and feels no shame, And scarcely do his lips inquire thy name. Had not thy towering summit long before Redeem'd the burden, that the deluge bore, Thou hadst not worn memorials so unjust, The prints of thoughtless footsteps in thy dust: And earth until this very hour had run A silent planet round the golden sun. 'T was Ararat alone preserved from death The little portion of almighty breath. When the fierce warfare of the heaven is o'er; And thunders, answering thunders cease to roar, How beautiful to see the sun's bright helm Shining serene in his recover'd realm! The victor in his robes of triumph drest, Looks gay and smiling from the rosy west! The dew drops catch the triumphs of the sky, And flash a little sun on every eye! Such joy did in the patriarch's bosom reign, When first the arch reposed on earth again. He cries, “in reverence to this holy place. Put off your sandals, all of Noah's race! It is the hour of mercy, and invites The bleeding sacrifice and solemn rites.” The few survivors of the flood draw near; An altar form'd with pious haste they rear, And fain would female pity intercede, The favorite lamb is now condemn'd to bleed; He, unsuspecting injury, draws nigh, Nor thinking he is ever doom'd to die, Bounds by the altar, with his merry feet; The mountain echoes still return his bleat; When Japheth grasps him by his snowy fleece, Upward he looks, his eyes betoken peace, So pure is innocence, so undismay'd! He sees no terror in the lifted blade: Then faint and dying at the altar's base, One look he casts upon the female face, And while the ruddy drops his vesture stain He wonders why he feels the sudden pain. The flame ascends, and while the suppliants kneel, And offer up their prayers with pious zeal, They start, they listen, for a sudden sound Disturbs the sacred quiet reigning round; It calls thee! Noah, and the accent flows, Soft as a zephyr's whisper to a rose. He turn'd, and saw a face that seem'd to wear A mingled character of joy and care: It was not joy; for though upon the cheek A smile appear'd, it was a smile so meek, So coy, so placid, every eye might know 'T was touch'd with memory of former wo; And though the foreheads yielding ivory wore The marks that Care's rude hand had sculptured o'er, The traces now were fugitive and faint, Smoothed to the resignation of a saint. He saw an eye, that when it cast a look Down on the deluge, instantly partook Of deep anxiety; when on the face Of Noah, it had found a resting place, Sorrow was banish'd from its orbit quite, It sparkled with a tender mild delight. The patriarch gazed, and felt, he knew not why, Uncommon reverence for that pensive eye; But when he saw the bow that rose and spread Its mellow'd radiance round the stranger's head; When he beheld upon her panting breast The dove alight, and close his wings to rest; Doubt was removed, he cried with welcome brow, Angel of mercy, I behold thee now! “Thee, Patriarch, I have known,” the vision said; “From earliest infancy I 've watched thy head. I knew thee in that season, when the toy Of merry childhood could afford thee joy: Saw thee, when truant from a parent's care With spirits high, and heart as light as air, Thy infant eye had caught in summer hour The insect plunderer of the fragrant flower, Loading his little thighs with waxen spoil And humming like a laborer o'er his toil. Beheld thy hand that could not then forbear To seize the poor mechanic seated there, The little captive look'd, and saw with dread The infant blossom closing o'er his head; Disconsolate, he roam'd his narrow cell, The petty prisoner of a floweret bell. Be it my present office to display Some great events that time's unfolding ray In long futurity shall bring to light, Though now deep buried in the shades of night. No more the thorns and thistles in thy ground, Shall raise their martial points to fence thee round; That sad and mournful family, that shun All vegetation and the cheering sun, And seem in some secluded spot to tell, In whispers to the wind, that Adam fell. Thy spot of ground no ruffian weed shall taunt, But in its stead, thy hand the vine shall plant, The fruitful vine, and, while thou joy'st to know How full and dark its clustering honors grow, More shalt thou joy to hear what God enjoins:— Thy progeny shall far exceed the vine's. But ah! thou little know'st what depth of sin, What idiot frenzy dwells the grape within; Reason no longer holds her balance true, With eyes once bathed in this bewildering dew; He tastes;—the victim knows not when to stop, Though frantic demons poison every drop. Down, down, he sinks in ruin and despair; In vain may sacred friendship, weeping there, In vain may fathers, brothers intercede, In vain may honor execrate the deed. Still does the charm, the infernal spell allure, The demon laughs, his prey is now secure. The solid earth presents too small a space To bound the enterprise of Adam's race; A hardy race of men shall spring from thee Whose only residence an ark shall be. For lo! astonish'd ocean shall survey, In future times, though distant now the day, Such wonders as have never reach'd his ken. His empire humbled by the sons of men. Arks beyond number, borne by heavenly breath, Shall dare the surface of the roaring death. Vain does he fret and climb the heights of air, Like some proud steed that scorns his lord to bear. In vain he foams and rears, for human skill Has conquer'd, and he feels the bridle still. Ocean's proud giant sees the roaring main Usurp'd by man, and flies, but flies in vain, O'er liquid mountains, horrible to name, Intent on death, man seeks the timorous game— In vain the monster trembles, and retreats To his dark caverns, and his coral seats, The persecutor, anxious for his prey, Waits his return unto the beams of day; There struck—he flies and flounders with the pain, And seeks the dark recesses of the main; Vain is his flight opposed to human skill, For there, the barb of death pursues him still; Again he rises to the upper air, In vain, for hostile vengeance follows there; Now see! the monster spouts away his breath, Lashes the foaming surge, then sinks to death, His native element is no retreat, He pours his life-blood at his conquerer's feet. Would that his life alone might ocean stain! Ah no, the spirit of departed Cain Henceforth shall rise and walk the earth again. In vain may suppliant mercy intercede, How many Abels shall be doom'd to bleed! More wonders still!—thy race, by vengeance driven, Shall seize and hurl the thunderbolt of heaven! Yea, the dread lightning by divine command, Shall flash hereafter in a human hand. O while ye grasp the bolts of heaven—forbear! The life of brother! man, in pity spare! O cherish still the transitory breath, Nor call these agents to the aid of death! Vain is the wish, the man in future days Shall claim the high reward, his country's praise! For all the varied misery that appears In father's, brother's, widow's, orphan's tears; For lives so dear—thus butcher'd day by day, A leaf of paltry laurel shall repay; Detested plant! see all its verdant veins Are running now with deep and scarlet stains! Fann'd by, O innocence! thy sacred sighs, The floweret smells and blossoms to the skies! How horrible to tell! and yet how true! The plant is nourish'd by a bloody dew. I hear the thunder roar,—the dying shriek— The raven flap—the terrors of his beak! He sees the tumult in his airy way, He scents the carnage, and he stoops for prey. O righteous heaven! why is Almighty love So long delay'd, why lingers yet my dove? The earth shall mourn, and desolate with grief, And rue the absence of the olive leaf— Refrain, my sons—this dreadful deed refrain Let not the tears of mercy plead in vain! The eagle towering in his pride of place, Shall see some venturous son of Adam's race, Mounted on wings, with balance just and true, Scouring with him the firmament of blue; Such wonders shall be known in future times; Unterrified from cloud to cloud, he climbs, Till from the height of his celestial seat, Rivers shall vanish underneath his feet. And even Ararat that towers so grand, Shall seem diminish'd to a grain of sand. Behold him where the ærial tribes are seen Supported by a bubble, sail serene, And though the sport of all the winds that blow, He sees a subjugated world below. Now, in a cloud the glittering wonder hides, Anon, it skims along the clear blue tides, While shouting thousands with admiring gaze, Pursue this sailor of the solar blaze. The time shall come, so speaks Almighty doom, When human art shall triumph o'er the tomb; The body form'd with such transcendant art, Such nicety of skill in every part, Shall, though the seat of an immortal mind, Vanish from earth, and leave its shade behind. Thy tame, obsequious shadow in thy way, That humble offspring of the solar ray, Lives to proclaim this truth to all thy line, A sunbeam boasts a longer date than thine. Go worship at ambition's bloody fane, Till even rapine would its rage restrain; Go climb the fields of air, the heights explore, Beyond where even eagles dare to soar; Go set thy footstep on the roaring wave, Defy the ocean's depth, his coral cave; Go snatch the lightning from the azure field, And teach thy hand the bolt of heaven to wield; Then, son of Adam, count thy mighty gains, Of all thy glory, but the corpse remains; Poor heir of sickness, sorrow, and decay, Thou wretched tenant of a little day, One moment moving, like a god august, The next—a mass of silent mouldering dust; Though death with such remorseless vengeance drives, Thy cold insensate shadow still survives. It lives to tell how small the human span What frail materials constitute a man; It lives a satire on the very name Of human grandeur, and thy hopes of fame. Still art shall triumph with the conqueror's wreath, And teach the rugged marble how to breathe; The human form beneath her magic shock Breaks from the rude recesses of the rock; The frowning quarry that no tempest fears, That bears the brunt of heaven for endless years, When touch'd by art, and fashion'd by her skill, Dissolves in female beauty at her will. Behold, enrapturing every heart and hand, Cold and serene the marble virgin stand! What harmony, what symmetry, what grace, Move o'er each limb and languish on the face! How loose, how lovely all the tresses flow Upon that bosom's pure and lustrous snow; She frowns, each bold intruder to reprove, Ah! why does not the lovely vision move? Wherefore this silence, why this steadfast air? Rouse from thy slumber, speak, thou lovely fair! Alas! how vain is all this blaze of skill, The breath, the Almighty breath is wanting still; Stay, and this lovely prodigy behold, How beautiful to view, and yet how cold. What idle industry, what fruitless pain— The virgin steps into the block again. Monarchs shall strive amidst an empire's shock To gain possession of this beauteous block: Poets shall sing its praise in strains so sweet, That even listening angels might repeat; From distant nations, pilgrims still shall come, And gaze till admiration's self be dumb; 'T is still bereft of an Almighty breath, And stands a steadfast monument of death. Unconquer'd man, by science guided far, Shall boldly measure every brilliant star, Till all these orbs in glory so replete Shall roll in silent homage at his feet. Here is a triumph for thy honor'd brow: Is man encircled with the laurel now? This conquest, purchased by no bloody stains, Among thy kindred no distinction gains, In vain the lights of yonder heaven may plead If carnage does not consecrate the deed!’ The angel paused; her face so fair to view Look'd lovelier in the drops of sorrowing dew; The patriarch gazed, the vision sunk in air, But Mercy's tears were still remaining there. CRYSTALINA. Then down the vale, the hermit led the way; The Knight pursued, impatient of delay: Dark was that vale, of tall gigantic wood, The grim abode of elves and beasts of blood; The couchant tiger scream'd as they pass'd by, And on them wildly roll'd his meteor-eye! The wolf sprang frighted from the crackling brake, And in their pathway coil'd the hissing snake. High o'er their heads, umbrageous oaks outspread Their giant arms, and awful murmurs made. Scarce had they reach'd the centre of the vale, When lo! black clouds, before a northern gale, Came sweeping on, and with a dusky veil Shrouded the moon—the mountain tops, oak crown'd, Toss'd in the storm, and echoed to the sound Of trees uptorn, and thunders rolling round. They sat them down beneath an aged oak, Which, though late riven by a thunder-stroke, Seem'd tempest-proof, and there the fearless Knight Waited impatient for returning light. Tremendous scene! the prowlers of the wood Stopp'd in mid-chase and spared their victim's blood, Fled to their caves, or crouching with alarm, Howl'd at the passing spirits of the storm! Eye-blasting spectres and bleach'd skeletons, With snow-white raiment, and disjointed bones, Before them strode; and meteors, flickering dire, Around them trail'd their scintillating fire, Livid and pale as light of funeral pyre. Serenely grand, the venerable Sage Beheld the scene and heard the tempest rage, Then rose abruptly, and with accents dire, Bade the fierce demons of the storm retire! The clouds dispersed; again the tranquil moon Sat in mid sky upon her silver throne, And heaven's blue vault with stars unnumber'd shone. No sound was heard, save where the torrent hoar Down the steep mountain fell with sullen roar, Or far away, exploding long and loud, The deep-toned thunder rent the fiery cloud. Then thus, beneath the thunder-riven oak, The hoary wizard to Rinaldo spoke— “See'st thou yon glade, where quivering moon-beams play, Like dancing spectres on a tomb-stone gray? In that still glade, a fairy-circle lies— When Cynthia, Night's torch-bearer, lights the skies There sportive Fairies dance till Phœbus rise; If so thou dar'st, approach that circle dread, And thrice three times around it boldly tread. Then shall the earth beneath thy feet expand, And a dark road disclose to Fairy land.” The Hermit ceased, and by the dim moon-light, Rinaldo spied the circle, glistening bright. Back to his cave the old magician went, Whilst bold Rinaldo towards the circle bent His desperate course—his temper'd steel he drew, And thrice around the mystic circle flew. Then rose from earth deep groans and fearful cries, And lurid meteors shot along the skies. When round the ring he hurried thrice again, The earth sent up a blue sulphureous flame, That burnt and quiver'd like a dying lamp— But on he press'd with firm and fearless tramp. Now when nine times the Knight had hasted round, The hollow earth sent forth a rumbling sound, And, wide and sudden, yawn'd the rocking ground. Down the dark chasm the desp'rate warrior strode, With random steps along a viewless road; Till massy rocks his onward march opposed, And o'er his head the earth in thunder closed; But soon a passage in the cloven stone With joy he found, and boldly hurried on. But slow and cautious, with his pond'rous spear, Poised his bold march along the labyrinth drear. Through rayless glooms; through silence deep and dread, Down, downward far the dismal cavern led. At length beneath him shone a silver light, Like glow-worm twinkling through the gloom of night, And tuneful sounds, celestial, high, and clear, Rose from beneath and charm'd his wondering ear. Thither he sped, and from the narrow way Sprang with delight into a realm of day, And upright stood upon the radiant plain Of Fairy land, a heavenly domain. O! 'twas a valley of enchanting view, Where all things lovely and delightful grew; Where groves of orange, cinnamon, and myrrh, Trees that bled frankincense and balsams rare, With grateful odors fill'd the breezy air— Elysian groves of harmony and flowers, Leafy pavilions and ambrosial bowers; With many a mead, and many a winding stream, Glade flowering fair, and glittering lake between. Not the spiced breeze, from Ceylon's groves that springs, Or shakes Arabian odors from its wings; Not shining gardens of Hesperides, Whose golden rivers and auriferous trees, The setting sun from his prone chariot sees, Nor aught on earth for fragrance could compare, Nor yet for beauty with this valley fair. This gay, celestial valley to enclose, Mountains sublime in even circle rose, And towering high, on tip-toe seem'd to stand, To gaze enchanted on the radiant land. Glowing aloft a golden cloud was spread, Whose splendid vault a rich effulgence shed On all below—for sun, nor moon, nor star Was ever seen, or ever needed there. Like a vast amphitheatre it seem'd, With mountain-walls; from storm and sunshine screen'd By costly canopy of sheeted gold— But greater far and fairer to behold. In sweet amaze and exultation high, O'er all the scene the youth directs his eye— His wilder'd thoughts in floods of rapture float, And time, and place, and being are forgot— “Celestial visions!” cried th' astonish'd Knight— “Ye golden prospects that enchant my sight! Are ye indeed substantial? or but vain, And wild illusions of a love-sick brain? Methinks I dream!” When thus Rinaldo said, His well-known self, he doubtfully survey'd, And waved his arm and shook his plumed head. But soon the memory of his captive love The sweet amazement from his senses drove. “Fair land!” he cried—“and dangerous as fair, A foe to thy prosperity is near; Darkness shall soon thy saffron skies o'erwhelm— I come to spoil thee of thy richest gem— But where, where fly to find my captive fair? No cities, fields, or cottages appear. 'T is desert all—th' unnumber'd flow'rets sweet Lift their gay heads unbruised by living feet; Even at my hand the fearless songsters sing, And round me flutter with familiar wing; Or 'mid the flowers, like sunbeams, glance about, Sipping with slender tongues the dainty nectar out. He ceased, and now a glittering palace sees, Deep in the vale amid embowering trees! A splendid pile of precious gems it seems, Wrapt in a blaze of variegated beams— With cautious steps he thither bent his way, Whilst all around, irradiations gay Full on his pathway beam'd celestial day. He trode on carpets, gorgeously display'd, Of woven flowers and grassy verdure made. From all the waving trees, the plumy throngs, Welcomed the warlike stranger with their songs And lo! from bowers of myrtle, fair and green, A choir of damsels dance with smiling mien! Their silken robes the playful zephyrs throw From side to side, and wantonly bestow Delightful glimpses of their limbs of snow. With lily-hands they strike the trembling strings Of golden lyres—the grove responsive rings, Soothing his soul with endless echoings. Towards the palace, silent and alone The hero moved—afar the fabric shone Like gorgeous clouds that throng the setting sun: But ere he reach'd that palace, huge and bright, A glorious scene detain'd the wondering Knight— A pearly river! whose melodious tide Laved golden shores! whose banks were beautified With trees wide-waving, paridisian bowers And all the gaudy multitude of flowers That on spring's lap the liberal Flora showers. This stream, dividing, roll'd its branches twain, In circling sweep around a flowery plain, Through vocal groves, then fondly met again. The Islet fair, so form'd, arose between, With dome-like swell, array'd in richest green. So fair it was, so smooth, so heavenly sweet, It seem'd made only for angelic feet. On this green isle the splendid palace stood, And rainbow bridges arch'd the pearly flood— A fairer bow fair Juno ne'er display'd In vernal skies, though not, like Juno's, made Of subtle sun-beams, but of solid gems, Such as adorn imperial diadems. Its blue was solid sapphire. Its gay green Was massy emerald. The ruby sheen Form'd its bright curve of rich and rosy red; Its yellow hue the golden topaz shed. Seem'd either end on snow-white clouds to lie— They were not clouds, but sculptured ivory! And now a bugle breathed a silver sound, Whose notes with soft reverberations, round Rang sweet and long; now silently unfold The diamond gates on hinge of polish'd gold; And now rode out a fairy cavalcade In order'd march; with banners bright display'd, With diamond lances and with golden helms, And shields of gold emboss'd with sparkling gems, Advanced the pageant; proud beneath each knight, O'er grassy levels pranced their steeds milk-white, Whose ivory hoofs in glittering silver shod, With nimble grace on blushing flow'rets trod. Prancing they came, and as the trumpets blew, They neigh'd for pride, and arch'd their necks of snow; Toss'd their proud heads indignant of the rein, Champ'd their foam'd bits and paw'd the trembling plain. Warrior and steed array'd for battle shone, Whose burnish'd mail and bright caparison Illumed, far round, the flower-enwoven field, And restless splendors flash'd from shield to shield. Loud in the van the wreathed bugle spoke, Till woods and floods with martial clamors shook. Now sad, amid a shady solitude, On the green margin of a prattling flood, Rinaldo paused—as there forlorn he stood, The swell of distant melody he heard; Anon, a golden chariot appear'd, Proudly advancing, drawn by peacocks fair, With gorgeous plumery, dancing in the air. On that bright chariot, in imperial state, The queen of Oberon, fair Titania, sate: On downy cushion, rich with gold and green, Aloft she sat, like Jove's celestial queen, When, through the skies, she drives her glowing car, And gazing gods adore her from afar. Around Titania, youths and damsels throng, Warbling, with dulcet breath, a magic song, Whose mazy tide intoxicates the soul— From neighboring rocks a thousand echoes roll The refluent sounds, and fondly multiply, With busy tongues, th' angelic harmony. In robes of green, fresh youths the concert led, Measuring, the while, with nice, emphatic tread Of tinkling sandals, the melodious sound Of smitten timbrels; some, with myrtles crown'd, Pour the smooth current of sweet melody, Through ivory tubes; some blow the bugle free, And some, at happy intervals, around, With trumps sonorous swell the tide of sound; Some, bending raptured o'er their golden lyres, With cunning fingers fret the tuneful wires; With rosy lips, some press the syren shell, And through its crimson labyrinths, impel Mellifluous breath, with artful sink and swell. Some blow the mellow, melancholy horn, Which, save the Knight, no man of woman born, E'er heard and fell not senseless to the ground, With viewless fetters of enchantment bound. The nodding trees its magic influence own, And, spell-struck, drop their golden clusters down; The forests quaver, and elysian bowers, With pleasing tremors shed their fragrant flowers. An awful silence, winds and waters keep; And spell-chain'd brooks, that bound from steep to steep, On jutting rocks, delay their headlong leap. The cross alone, the holy cross disarms The Fairy fiends, and baffles all their charms. SONGS OF THE SEER. On sweet May-eve, when groves were green, And wild birds chanted merrily, When the air was calm, the sky serene, It was a lady of high degree, And she sat under a green-wood tree, O! she waited there for her dear knight, But the sun had set, the birds were mute, The dark wolf howl'd on the mountain height; The raven croak'd, the owl did hoot, And pale-red meteors round her shoot. O! oft she gazed, and oft she sigh'd; Oft listened for Alonzo's tread— “Why tarries thus my love?” she cried— “The hour, the appointed hour has fled, The night-dew chills my houseless head. “Ah! why did I believe his tale, And leave my father's castle gay, To meet him in this secret vale? Or why, ah! why does Alonzo stay? 'T is night, and the castle is far away! “But hark! a distant voice I hear!— 'T is not my love, but the night owl's cry”— Thus wails Syrenna, wild with fear; Her raven-locks on the night-winds fly, Her breath is quick and her heart beats high. Now the sky grew black, the winds blew loud, The lightning gleam'd on the dusky vale And thunder spoke from his deep-blue cloud— Up rose Syrenna, wild and pale, And shriek'd and fled through the stormy gale— But when she reach'd a lonely glade, Where wild-briars rude and thistles stood, A ghastly fiend her eyes survey'd! It beckon'd her to a gloomy wood— “'T is my love!” she cried—and swift pursued. It led the maid to a cavern deep! But on the gulf the lightning glared, Before she took the fatal leap! The spectre laugh'd and disappear'd— But the Benshie's fatal scream she heard. And she heard, in her ear, a death-bell toll, And the raven croak on a blasted tree— The Lord have mercy on her soul! It was a piteous sight to see The sorrows of that sweet lady. And now a-down that dusky glen She saw, she chased the fell rush-light— It led her to a watery fen, Then shriek'd, and quench'd its taper bright— And all was horror, all was night. And now strange voices fill the air, And yells, and shouts both loud and long— Ah fly! ah fly! distracted fair, For fierce and fast the fiends come on, And see! grim phantoms round thee throng. Syrenna fled, in vain fled she; For the ghastly crew met her blasted view, And a black fiend spoke, and fierce spoke he, As his arms round her snow-white neck he threw, “We, lady fair! are the Elfin crew! “Thrice welcome to our merry glen! And thou shalt be our mistress bright, And dance with us on the quaking fen, To the rush-light's red and glimmering light, When tempests howl at dead of night.” They grasp'd her hard by her tender hand, They dragg'd her away by her raven hair; Her shrieks were loud, but the ghastly band To a stormy heath led the lady fair, And bared her breast to the driving air. On the stormy heath a ring they form; They place therein the fearful maid, And round her dance in the howling storm— The winds beat hard on her lovely head; But she clasp'd her hands and nothing said. O! 'twas, I ween, a ghastly sight, To see their uncouth revelry; The lightning was the taper bright, The thunder was the melody, To which they danced with horrid glee! The fierce-eyed owl did on them scowl; The bat play'd round on leathern wing; The coal-black wolf did at them howl, The coal-black raven did croak and sing And o'er them flap his dusky wing. An earthquake heaved beneath their feet; Pale meteors revel'd in the sky; The clouds sail'd by like a routed fleet, The night-winds shriek'd as they pass'd by, The dark-red moon was eclipsed on high— But hark! what voice, as thunder loud, Now shakes the wilderness profound? Whose form appears so tall and proud? Beneath whose foot-step quakes the ground, And whose bright armor gleams around? O! 't is Alonzo true and brave, And loud he calls on his true-love's name— He comes! he comes the maid to save, Through thunder, lightning, wind and rain, With buckler broad and sword of flame. Alonzo spied his lady fair, He spied her amid that ghastly crew, And he spurr'd his steed and couch'd his spear— But the holy cross on his breast they knew, And shriek'd, and away like lightning flew. “And hast thou come?” cried the lady bright— “Alonzo comes!”—the knight replied, “To keep his promise with thee to-night; For spite of thy father's cruel pride, Sweet lady! thou shalt be my bride.” He spoke, and mounted his foamy steed, He took his lady fair, behind, And away he rode to their bridal bed, More swiftly than the mountain-hind When the hunter's cry is on the wind. But all that night raved the tempest dire; A thunder shaft on the castle fell, Of dark Almanzor, the lady's sire, And the winds all night rung his castle-bell— They rung it loud for Almanzor's knell! LYDIA HUNTLEY SIGOURNEY. EXCUSE FOR NOT FULFILLING AN ENGAGEMENT. WRITTEN IN SCHOOL, AUGUST, 1814. My friend, I gave a glad assent To your request at noon, But now I find I cannot leave My little ones so soon.— Early I came, and as my feet First enter'd at the door, “Remember!”—to myself I said, “You must dismiss at four.” But slates, and books, and maps appear, And many a dear one cries, “O tell us where that river runs, And where these mountains rise, And where that blind old monarch reign'd, And who was king before, And stay a little after five, And tell us something more.”— And then my little Alice A child deprived of the powers of speech and hearing. comes, And who unmoved can view, The glance of that imploring eye, “Pray, teach me something too.” Yet who would think amid the toil, (Though scarce a toil it be,) That through the door the muses coy Should deign to peep at me.— Their brow is somewhat cold and stern, As if it fain would say, “We did not know you kept a school, We must have lost our way.” Their visit was but short indeed, As these slight numbers show, But ah! they bade me write with speed, My friend,—I cannot go. THE CORAL INSECT. Toil on! toil on! ye ephemeral train, Who build in the tossing and treacherous main; Toil on,—for the wisdom of man ye mock, With your sand-based structures and domes of rock; Your columns the fathomless fountains lave, And your arches spring up to the crested wave; Ye 're a puny race, thus to boldly rear A fabric so vast, in a realm so drear. Ye bind the deep with your secret zone, The ocean is seal'd, and the surge a stone; Fresh wreaths from the coral pavement spring, Like the terraced pride of Assyria's king; The turf looks green where the breakers roll'd; O'er the whirlpool ripens the rind of gold; The sea-snatch'd isle is the home of men, And mountains exult where the wave hath been. But why do ye plant 'neath the billows dark The wrecking reef for the gallant bark? There are snares enough on the tented field, 'Mid the blossom'd sweets that the valleys yield; There are serpents to coil, ere the flowers are up; There 's a poison-drop in man's purest cup, There are foes that watch for his cradle breath, And why need ye sow the floods with death? With mouldering bones the deeps are white, From the ice-clad pole to the tropics bright;— The mermaid hath twisted her fingers cold With the mesh of the sea-boy's curls of gold, And the gods of ocean have frown'd to see The mariner's bed in their halls of glee;— Hath earth no graves, that ye thus must spread The boundless sea for the thronging dead? Ye build,—ye build,—but ye enter not in, Like the tribes whom the desert devour'd in their sin; From the land of promise ye fade and die, Ere its verdure gleams forth on your weary eye;— As the kings of the cloud-crown'd pyramid, Their noteless bones in oblivion hid; Ye slumber unmark'd 'mid the desolate main, While the wonder and pride of your works remain. DEATH OF AN INFANT. Death found strange beauty on that cherub brow, And dash'd it out. There was a tint of rose On cheek and lip;—he touch'd the veins with ice, And the rose faded.—Forth from those blue eyes There spoke a wishful tenderness,—a doubt Whether to grieve or sleep, which Innocence Alone can wear. With ruthless haste he bound The silken fringes of their curtaining lids For ever. There had been a murmuring sound With which the babe would claim its mother's ear, Charming her even to tears. The spoiler set His seal of silence. But there beam'd a smile So fix'd and holy from that marble brow,— Death gazed and left it there;—he dared not steal The signet-ring of heaven. WITH WILD FLOWERS TO A SICK FRIEND. Rise from the dells where ye first were born, From the tangled beds of the weed and thorn, Rise! for the dews of the morn are bright, And haste away with your brows of light.— —Should the green-house patricians with gathering frown, On your plebeian vestures look haughtily down, Shrink not,—for His finger your heads hath bow'd, Who heeds the lowly and humbles the proud.— —The tardy spring, and the frosty sky, Have meted your robes with a miser's eye, And check'd the blush of your blossoms free,— With a gentler friend your home shall be; To a kinder ear you may tell your tale Of the zephyr's kiss and the scented vale;— Ye are charm'd! ye are charm'd! and your fragrant sigh Is health to the bosom on which ye die. MISSOLONGHI. Famine hath worn them pale, that noble band;— Yet round the long beleaguer'd wall, With wasted frame, and iron hand, Like watching skeletons they stand, To conquer or to fall. Hark!—Hark! the war-cry. Swells the shout From wild Arabia's wandering rout, From turbid Nilus' swarthy brood, From Ibrahim's host who thirst for blood, 'T is answer'd from the echoing skies, Sons of Miltiades, arise!— Aged men, with temples gray!— Why do ye haste to the battle fray?— Home to the couch of ease, and pray.— But ah! I read on those brows of gloom, That your sons have found a gory tomb, And ye with despair and grief opprest, Would strike ere ye share their clay-cold rest.— With features pale, yet sternly wrought To all the agony of thought, Yon widow'd mothers mount the tower, To guard the wall in danger's hour:— Fast by their side in mute distress, Their little sons unwavering press, Taught from their cradle-bed to know The bitter tutelage of wo, No idle fears in their bosoms glow, But pride and wrath in their dark eyes glance, As they lift their martyr'd father's lance. Yet more!—Yet more!—At beat of drum With wildly flowing hair, Helle's beauteous maidens come, The iron strife to dare.— Sadly sweet from those lips of rose, The death-song of Bozzaris flows, It is your dirge, ye turban'd foes!— Rise, soul of Pindar! strike the shadowy lyre, Start from your sculptured tombs, ye sons of fire! Snatch, snatch those gentle forms from war's alarms, And throw your adamantine shield around their shrinking charms. Louder swells the battle-cry; God of Christians! from the sky Behold the Turk's accursed host Come rushing in.—'T is lost! 'T is lost!— Ye bold defenders, die!— O thou, who sang'st of Ilion's walls the fate, Unseal thy blinded orbs, thine own are desolate. The stifled sob of mighty souls Rises on the glowing air, And the vow of vengeance rolls, Mingled with the dying prayer: “Now, by the spirits of the brave, Sires, who rode on glory's wave, By red Scio's wrongs and groans, By Ipsara's unburied bones, Our foes beneath these reeking stones, Shall find a grave.” Earth heaves, as if she gorged again Usurping Korah's rebel train, She heaves, with blast more wild and loud, Than when with trump of thunders proud, The electric flame subdues the cloud, Torn and dismember'd frames are thrown on high, And then the oppressor and oppress'd in equal silence lie. Come, jewell'd Sultan, from thine hall of state! Exult o'er Missolonghi's fall, With flashing eye, and step elate The blood-pools count around her ruin'd wall.— Seek'st thou thus with glances vain The remnant of thy Moslem train?— Hither they came, with haughty brow, They conquer'd here,—where are they now? Ask the hoarse vulture with her new-flesh'd beak, Bid the gaunt watch-dog speak, Who bay'd so long around his murder'd master's door,— They, with shriek and ban can tell The burial-place of the infidel, Go! bind thy turban round thy brow of shame, And hurl the mutter'd curse at thy false prophet's name. Ancient and beautiful!—who stand'st alone In the dire crusade, while with hearts of stone Thy sister nations close the leaden eye Regardless of thine agony. Such friends had He, who once with bursting pore, On sad Gethsemane a lost world's burden bore.— Leave, leave the sacred steep Where thy lone muses weep, Forth from thy sculptured halls, Thy pilgrim-haunted walls, Thy classic fountains' crystal flood, Go!—angel-strengthen'd to the field of blood. Raise thy white arm,—unbind thy wreathed hair, And God's dread name upon thy breastplate wear, Stand in His might, till the pure cross arise O'er the proud minaret, and woo propitious skies. BURIAL OF THE YOUNG. There was an open grave,—and many an eye Look'd down upon it. Slow the sable hearse Moved on, as if reluctantly it bare The young, unwearied form to that cold couch, Which age and sorrow render sweet to man. —There seem'd a sadness in the humid air, Lifting the long grass from those verdant mounds Where slumber multitudes.— —There was a train Of young, fair females, with their brows of bloom, And shining tresses. Arm in arm they came, And stood upon the brink of that dark pit, In pensive beauty, waiting the approach Of their companion. She was wont to fly, And meet them, as the gay bird meets the spring, Brushing the dew-drop from the morning flowers, And breathing mirth and gladness. Now she came With movements fashion'd to the deep-toned bell:— She came with mourning sire, and sorrowing friend, And tears of those who at her side were nursed By the same mother. Ah! and one was there, Who, ere the fading of the summer rose, Had hoped to greet her as his bride. But death Arose between them. The pale lover watch'd So close her journey through the shadowy vale, That almost to his heart, the ice of death Enter'd from hers. There was a brilliant flush Of youth about her,—and her kindling eye Pour'd such unearthly light, that hope would hang Even on the archer's arrow, while it dropp'd Deep poison. Many a restless night she toil'd For that slight breath which held her from the tomb, Still wasting like a snow-wreath, which the sun Marks for his own, on some cool mountain's breast, Yet spares, and tinges long with rosy light. —Oft o'er the musings of her silent couch, Came visions of that matron form which bent With nursing tenderness, to soothe and bless Her cradle dream: and her emaciate hand In trembling prayer she raised—that He who saved The sainted mother, would redeem the child. Was the orison lost?—Whence then that peace So dove-like, settling o'er a soul that loved Earth and its pleasures?—Whence that angel smile With which the allurements of a world so dear Were counted and resign'd? that eloquence So fondly urging those whose hearts were full Of sublunary happiness to seek A better portion? Whence that voice of joy, Which from the marble lip in life's last strife Burst forth, to hail her everlasting home? —Cold reasoners! be convinced. And when ye stand Where that fair brow, and those unfrosted locks Return to dust,—where the young sleeper waits The resurrection morn,—Oh! lift the heart In praise to Him, who gave the victory. TO THE MOON. Hail beauteous and inconstant!—Thou who roll'st Thy silver car around the realm of night, Queen of soft hours! how fanciful art thou In equipage and vesture.—Now thou com'st With slender horn piercing the western cloud, As erst on Judah's hills, when joyous throngs With trump and festival saluted thee; Anon thy waxing crescent 'mid the host Of constellations, like some fairy boat, Glides o'er the waveless sea; then as a bride Thou bow'st thy cheek behind a fleecy veil, Timid and fair; or, bright in regal robes, Dost bid thy full orb'd chariot proudly roll, Sweeping with silent rein the starry path Up to the highest node,—then plunging low To seek dim Nadir in his misty cell.— —Lov'st thou our earth, that thou dost hold thy lamp To guide and cheer her, when the wearied sun Forsakes her?—Sometimes, roving on, thou shedd'st The eclipsing blot ungrateful, on that sire Who feeds thy urn with light,—but sinking deep 'Neath the dark shadow of the earth dost mourn And find thy retribution. —Dost thou hold Dalliance with ocean, that his mighty heart Tosses at thine approach, and his mad tides, Drinking thy favoring glance, more rudely lash Their rocky bulwark?—Do thy children trace Through crystal tube our coarser-featured orb Even as we gaze on thee?—With Euclid's art Perchance, from pole to pole, her sphere they span, Her sun-loved tropics—and her spreading seas Rich with their myriad isles. Perchance they mark Where India's cliffs the trembling cloud invade, Or Andes with his fiery banner flouts The empyrean,—where old Atlas towers,— Or that rough chain whence he of Carthage pour'd Terrors on Rome.—Thou, too, perchance, hast nursed Some bold Copernicus, or fondly call'd A Galileo forth, those sun-like souls Which shone in darkness, though our darkness fail'd To comprehend them.—Canst thou boast, like earth, A Kepler, skilful pioneer and wise?— A sage to write his name among the stars Like glorious Herschel?—or a dynasty Like great Cassini's, which from sire to son Transmitted science as a birthright seal'd? —Rose there some lunar Horrox,—to whose glance Resplendent Venus her adventurous course Reveal'd, even in his boyhood?—some La Place Luminous as the skies he sought to read?— Thou deign'st no answer,—or I fain would ask If since thy bright creation, thou hast seen Ought like a Newton, whose admitted eye The arcana of the universe explored? Light's subtle ray its mechanism disclosed, The impetuous comet his mysterious lore Unfolded,—system after system rose, Eternal wheeling through the immense of space, And taught him of their laws.—Even angels stood Amazed, as when in ancient times they saw On Sinai's top, a mortal walk with God.— —But he to whom the secrets of the skies Were whisper'd—in humility adored, Breathing with childlike reverence the prayer, —“When on yon heavens, with all their orbs, I gaze, Jehovah!—what is man?” A VISION OF THE ALPS. Italia's vales in verdure slept, While spring her humid odors wept, With wreaths the breathing statue bound, The fallen dome with ivy crown'd, And bade old Tiber's yellow wave With fuller flow its margin lave. Low at the base of Alps sublime, Where the columbar cypress grows, And falling streams with tuneful chime To slumber lull the ear of time, His cell a hermit chose. Once at his peaceful door reclined, While lonely musings soothed his mind, Soft mists involved his favorite tree, In fainter murmurs humm'd the bee, And in bright tints gay fancy drew A vision o'er his cheated view. A lovely form, in robes of light, Came gliding o'er his raptured sight; Fresh garlands 'mid her tresses glow'd, Around her steps strange beauty flow'd, Attendant birds pour'd forth their lays, And prank'd their plumage in her praise, The fawn came bounding o'er the earth, The tufted violets sprang to birth, The olive donn'd its vesture pale, And fragrance floated on the gale. Then, bold o'er Alpine cliffs she sped, The snow-wreath vanish'd at her tread, The singing rills went leaping down, The forest caught its graceful crown, And warblers cheer'd with carols loud, The cottage cradled on the cloud. Still, by the hermit's anxious eye Her form was traced ascending high, Where the last tints of verdure die. Even there, amid that dreary bound, Some hardy, slumbering flowers she found, Touch'd their chill lids, and kiss'd the tear That dimm'd their eye of azure clear, As leaning on their frosted bed, Their petals to the storm they spread. With graceful step, yet half afraid, Toil'd onward the celestial maid, And long and vainly strove with fate, The imprison'd streams to liberate; The blushing snows her wand confest, Yet held the vassals to their breast, And soften'd by her aspect sweet, The ice threw diamonds at her feet. Yet save the eagle-king, whose cry Came hoarsely from the blacken'd sky, Motion nor sound was lingering there, Amid that realm of chill despair. It seem'd throughout the drear domain That Life, too fiercely tried, Contending with the blast in vain, Had like the taper died. She paused—for towering bold and high, A splendid fabric met her eye. Of thick ribb'd ice, in arches pure, With battlement and embrasure, And cluster'd columns, tall and white: And frost-work tracery, dazzling bright, And turrets frowning at the cloud, Gleam'd forth its architecture proud. Here, age on age, with painful thought, The troubled elements had wrought, To stretch the rampart's massy line, With wreaths the pillar'd halls to twine, And 'neath the lash of tempests rude, Had oft their bitter task pursued, Arranging Winter's glittering spoil, With slow and aggregated toil. The admiring fair, with wonder fraught, An entrance to the structure sought; But a grim form her course withstood, Whose frigid eye congeal'd her blood. Aged, yet strong at heart he seem'd, His reverend beard like silver stream'd, Of polish'd ice, the sparkling gem Adorn'd his kingly diadem, And closer, as he spoke, he prest His ermine mantle o'er his breast. “Say! who art thou, intruder bold, Who near this lofty throne, Would with its monarch audience hold, Unbidden and alone? Why com'st thou thus with footstep free, Unnamed, unheralded, to me?” Recoiling from his brilliant cell, Whose breath in freezing tide, Congeal'd to sudden ice-drops fell, The undaunted maid replied; “I come, on Nature's mission kind, Oppression's victims to unbind, To bid the sceptred tyrant bow, And wake a smile on Misery's brow. The realm of bliss my care extends, Man, beast and insect are my friends. Each nursling of the nested grove, Each plant, and flower, and leaf, I love.” With kindling eye, and front of pride, The scornful monarch stern replied; “Nature and thou, are wise to give Wild Freedom's boon to all who live! The maddening flame promiscuous hurl'd, Would wrap in anarchy the world. Go! haste the hour when none shall view The million meekly serve the few; O'erturn the thrones which, fix'd as fate, By Time's strong oath are consecrate, Then lift your wonder-working rod, And Earth enfranchised, war with God! Bold and puissant must ye be, To rend this guarded dome from me!” His hand he raised in gestures strong, And angry blasts shriek'd wild and long. Vindictive Hail, with frozen eye, Pour'd forth his keen artillery, And Snow unlock'd, with threatening mien, A bleak and boundless magazine. With blanching lip and bloodless cheek The stricken stranger strove to speak. Though from her brow the garland fell Scentless and pale, yet, strange to tell, Reviving courage warm'd her breast, And firmer tones the might confest That may with woman dwell. “If from thy cold, unenvied state, Thy palace proud as desolate, Where fetters bind the free, One glance thy kingly eye would deign To mark the blessings of my reign, Disarm'd thy rage might be. The chainless rill, the new-born flower, The carol from the leafy bower, The strains that from creation roll, When on my harp she breathes her soul, Are emblems of the joy that springs, Deep, measureless, unspoken, When the dark chain of despot kings Is from the spirit broken. Hear'st thou such music in thy hall When warring blasts hold festival?” “Thou, who t' annul the law dost seek By which the strong control the weak, Wouldst thou in frantic madness sweep This glorious structure to the deep? Whelm in the dust yon turrets proud Which hurl their gauntlet 'gainst the cloud? And make these gem-encrusted plains A vulgar haunt for piping swains, And brawling brooks, and baby bowers, And nameless troops of vagrant flowers? Usurper, hence!” he rudely said, And trembling from his realm she fled; For thundering o'er the rocky crown, An avalanche rush'd fiercely down, And in its wide and wrecking storm Perchance had whelm'd her shrinking form. But a bright cloud its tissued fold Unclasp'd, of crimson blent with gold, And soaring on its wing she rose Homeward to heaven, to find repose Upon her couch of fadeless rose. The waking hermit, o'er whose head The lustre of this pageant fled, Retraced its scenes with wonder new, And musing thus the moral drew. “The genial gifts of Spring to earth, Methinks, are types of Freedom's birth, And the dark winter of my dream Oppression's emblem well may seem; For many a clime that meets our view, Will prove these varying symbols true.” CONNECTICUT RIVER. Fair River! not unknown to classic song;— Which still in varying beauty roll'st along, Where first thy infant fount is faintly seen, A line of silver 'mid a fringe of green; Or where, near towering rocks, thy bolder tide, To win the giant-guarded pass, doth glide; Or where, in azure mantle, pure and free, Thou giv'st thy cool hand to the waiting sea;— Though broader streams our sister realms may boast, Herculean cities, and a prouder coast, Yet, from the bound where hoarse St Lawrence roars To where La Plata rocks the sounding shores; From where the urns of slimy Nilus shine, To the blue waters of the rushing Rhine; Or where Ilissus glows like diamond spark, Or sacred Ganges whelms its votaries dark, No brighter skies the eye of day may see, No soil more verdant, nor a race more free. —See, where, amid their cultured vales, they stand, The generous offspring of a simple land; Too rough for flattery, and all fear above, King, priest, and prophet, in the homes they love. On equal laws their anchor'd hopes are stay'd, By all interpreted, and all obey'd. Alike the despot and the slave they hate, And rise firm columns of a happy state. To them content is bliss; and labor, health; And knowledge, power; and true religion, wealth. The farmer, here, with honest pleasure sees His orchards blushing to the fervid breeze, His bleating flocks, the shearer's care who need, His waving woods, the winter fire that feed, His hardy steers, that break the yielding soil, His patient sons, who aid their father's toil, The ripening fields, for joyous harvest drest, And the white spire that points a world of rest. —His thrifty mate, solicitous to bear An equal burden in the yoke of care, With vigorous arm the flying shuttle heaves, Or from the press the golden cheese receives; Her pastime, when the daily task is o'er, With apron clean, to seek her neighbor's door, Partake the friendly feast, with social glow, Exchange the news, and make the stocking grow; Then, hale and cheerful, to her home repair, When Sol's slant ray renews her evening care, Press the full udder for her children's meal, Rock the tired babe, or wake the tuneful wheel. See, toward yon dome, where village science dwells, What time the warning clock its summons swells, What tiny feet the well known path explore, And gaily gather from each sylvan door. The new wean'd child, with murmur'd tone proceeds, Whom her scarce taller baby-brother leads, Transferr'd as burdens, that the house-wife's care May tend the dairy, or the fleece prepare. Light-hearted group! who gambol wild and high, The daisy pluck, or chase the butterfly, Till by some traveller's wheels aroused from play, The stiff salute, with face demure, they pay, Bare the curl'd brow, or stretch the ready hand, The untutor'd homage of an artless land. The stranger marks, amid the joyous line, The little baskets whence they hope to dine; And larger books, as if their dexterous art Dealt most nutrition to the noblest part. Long may it be, ere luxury teach the shame To starve the mind, and bloat the unwieldy frame! Scorn not this lowly race, ye sons of pride! Their joys disparage, nor their hopes deride; From germs like these have mighty statesmen sprung, Of prudent counsel, and persuasive tongue; Bold patriot souls, who ruled the willing throng, Their powerful nerves by early labor strong; Inventive minds, a nation's wealth that wrought, And white-hair'd sages, skill'd in studious thought Chiefs, who the field of battle nobly trod, And holy men, who fed the flock of God. Here, 'mid the graves by time so sacred made, The poor, lost Indian slumbers in the shade; He, whose canoe with arrowy swiftness clave, In ancient days, yon pure, cerulean wave; Son of that spirit, whom in storms he traced, Through darkness follow'd, and in death embraced,— He sleeps an outlaw, 'mid his forfeit land, And grasps the arrow in his moulder'd hand. Here too, those warrior sires with honor rest, Who bared in freedom's cause the valiant breast, Sprang from their half drawn furrow, as the cry Of threaten'd liberty came thrilling by, Look'd to their God, and rear'd in bulwark round Breasts free from guile, and hands with toil embrown'd, And bade a monarch's thousand banners yield— Firm at the plough, and glorious in the field; Lo! here they rest, who every danger braved, Unmark'd, untrophied, 'mid the soil they saved. —Round scenes like these, doth warm remembrance glide, Where emigration rolls its ceaseless tide. On western wilds, which thronging hordes explore, Or ruder Erie's serpent-haunted shore, Or far Huron, by unshorn forests crown'd, Or red Missouri's unfrequented bound, The exiled man, when midnight shades invade, Couch'd in his hut, or camping on the glade, Starts from his dream, to catch, in echoes clear, The boatman's song that pleased his boyish ear; While the sad mother, 'mid her children's mirth, Paints with fond tears a parent's distant hearth, Or charms her rustic babes, with tender tales Of thee, blest River! and thy velvet vales; Her native cot, where ripening berries swell, The village school, and sabbath's holy bell; And smiles to see the infant soul expand With proud devotion for that father land. FLORA'S PARTY. Lady Flora gave cards for a party at tea, To flowers, buds, and blossoms of every degree; So from town and from country they throng'd at the call, And strove by their charms to embellish the hall. First came the exotics, with ornaments rare, The tall Miss Corcoris, and Cyclamen fair, Auricula splendid, with jewels new-set, And gay Polyanthus, the pretty coquette. The Tulips came flaunting in gaudy array, With the Hyacinths, bright as the eye of the day; Dandy Coxcombs and Daffodils, rich and polite, With their dazzling new vests, and their corsets laced light; While the Soldiers in Green, cavalierly attired, Were all by the ladies extremely admired. But prudish Miss Lily, with bosom of snow, Declared that “those gentlemen stared at her so, It was horribly rude,”—so retired in a fright, And scarce stay'd to bid lady Flora good night. There were Myrtles and Roses from garden and plain, And Venus's Fly-Trap they brought in their train, So the beaux throng'd around them, they scarcely knew why, At the smile of the lip, or the glance of the eye. Madam Damask complain'd of her household and care, That she seldom went out save to breathe the fresh air, There were so many young ones and servants to stray, And the thorns grew so fast, if her eye was away. “Neighbor Moss-Rose,” said she, “you who live like a queen, And ne'er wet your fingers, don't know what I mean.” So the notable lady went on with her lay, Till her auditors yawn'd, or stole softly away. The sweet Misses Woodbine from country and town, With their brother in law, the wild Trumpet, came down, And Lupine, whose azure eye sparkled with dew, On Amaranth lean'd, the unchanging and true; While modest Clematis appear'd as a bride, And her husband, the Lilac, ne'er moved from her side, Though the belles giggled loudly, and said, “'T was a shame For a young married chit such attention to claim; They never attended a route in their life, Where a city-bred man ever spoke to his wife.” Miss Piony came in quite late, in a heat, With the Ice-Plant, new spangled from forehead to feet; Lobelia, attired like a queen in her pride, And the Dalias, with trimmings new furnish'd and dyed, And the Blue-bells and Hare-bells, in simple array, With all their Scotch cousins from highland and braé. Ragged Ladies and Marigolds cluster'd together, And gossip'd of scandal, the news and the weather; What dresses were worn at the wedding so fine Of sharp Mr Thistle, and sweet Columbine; Of the loves of Sweet-William and Lily the prude, Till the clamors of Babel again seem'd renew'd. In a snug little nook sate the Jessamine pale, And that pure, fragrant Lily, the gem of the vale; The meek Mountain-Daisy, with delicate crest, And the Violet, whose eye told the heaven in her breast; And allured to their group were the wise ones, who bow'd To that virtue which seeks not the praise of the crowd. But the proud Crown Imperial, who wept in her heart, That their modesty gain'd of such homage a part, Look'd haughtily down on their innocent mien, And spread out her gown that they might not be seen. The bright Lady-Slippers and Sweet-Briars agreed With their slim cousin Aspens a measure to lead; And sweet 't was to see their bright footsteps advance, Like the wing of the breeze through the maze of the dance. But the Monk's-Hood scowl'd dark, and, in utterance low, Declared “'t was high time for good christians to go; He 'd heard from his parson a sermon sublime, Where he proved from the Vulgate, to dance was a crime.” So, folding the cowl round his cynical head, He took from the sideboard a bumper, and fled. A song was desired, but each musical flower Had “taken a cold, and 't was out of her power;” Till sufficiently urged, they broke forth in a strain Of quavers and trills that astonish'd the train. Mimosa sat trembling, and said, with a sigh, “'T was so fine, she was ready with rapture to die.” And Cactus, the grammar-school tutor, declared “It might be with the gamut of Orpheus compared; Then moved himself round in a comical way, To show how the trees once had frisk'd at the lay. Yet Night-Shade, the metaphysician, complain'd, That the nerves of his ears were excessively pain'd; “'T was but seldom he crept from the college,” he said, “And he wish'd himself safe in his study or bed.” There were pictures, whose splendor illumined the place Which Flora had finish'd with exquisite grace; She had dipp'd her free pencil in Nature's pure dyes, And Aurora retouch'd with fresh purple the skies. So the grave connoisseurs hasted near them to draw, Their knowledge to show, by detecting a flaw. The Carnation took her eye-glass from her waist, And pronounced they were “not in good keeping or taste;” While prim Fleur de Lis, in her robe of French silk, And magnificent Calla, with mantle like milk, Of the Louvre recited a wonderful tale, And said “Guido's rich tints made dame Nature turn pale.” The Snow-Ball assented, and ventured to add His opinion, that “all Nature's coloring was bad;” He had thought so, e'er since a few days he had spent To study the paintings of Rome, as he went To visit his uncle Gentiana, who chose His abode on the Alps, 'mid a palace of snows. But he took on Mont Blanc such a terrible chill, That ever since that he 'd been pallid and ill.” Half wither'd Miss Hackmatack bought a new glass, And thought with her nieces, the Spruces, to pass; But bachelor Holly, who spy'd her out late, Destroy'd all her plans by a hint at her date. So she pursed up her mouth, and said tartly, with scorn, “She could not remember before she was born.” Old Jonquil, the crooked-back'd beau, had been told That a tax would be laid upon bachelor's gold; So he bought a new coat, and determined to try The long disused armor of Cupid so sly; Sought for half-open'd buds in their infantine years, And ogled them all, till they blush'd to their ears. Philosopher Sage on a sofa was prosing. With dull Dr Chamomile quietly dozing; Though the Laurel descanted, with eloquent breath, Of heroes and battles, of victory and death, Of the conquests of Greece, and Bozzaris the brave, “He had trod in his steps, and had sigh'd o'er his grave.” Farmer Sun-Flower was near, and decidedly spake Of “the poultry he fed, and the oil he might make;” For the true hearted soul deem'd a weather-stain'd face, And a toil-harden'd hand were no marks of disgrace. Then he beckon'd his nieces to rise from their seat, The plump Dandelion, and Cowslip so neat, And bade them to “pack up their duds and away, For the cocks crow'd so loud 't was the break o' the day.” —'T was indeed very late, and the coaches were brought, For the grave matron flowers of their nurseries thought; The lustre was dimm'd of each drapery rare, And the lucid young brows look'd beclouded with care; All save the bright Cereus, that belle so divine, Who joy'd through the curtains of midnight to shine. Now they curtsey'd and bow'd as they moved to the door, But the Poppy snored loud ere the parting was o'er, For Night her last candle was snuffing away, And Flora grew tired though she begg'd them to stay; Exclaim'd, “all the watches and clocks were too fast, And old Time ran in spite, lest her pleasures should last.” But when the last guest went, with daughter and wife, She vow'd she “was never so glad in her life;” Call'd out to her maids, who with weariness wept, To “wash all the glasses and cups ere they slept;” For “Aurora,” she said, “with her broad staring eye, Would be pleased, in the house, some disorder to spy;” Then sipp'd some pure honey-dew, fresh from the lawn, And with Zephyrus hasted to sleep until dawn. MUSING THOUGHTS. I did not dream, and yet untiring thought Rang such wild changes on the spirit's harp, It seem'd that slumber ruled. A structure rose Deep founded and gigantic. Strangely blent Its orders seem'd. The dusky Gothic tower Ecclesiastical, the turret proud In castellated pomp, the palace dome, The grated dungeon, and the peasant's cot Were grouped within its walls. A throne was there, A king with all his gay and courtly train In robes of splendor, and a vassal throng Eager to do his will, and pleased with chains Of gilded servitude. The back-ground seem'd Darken'd by Misery's pencil. Famine cast A tinge of paleness o'er the brow of toil, While Poverty, to soothe her naked babes, Shriek'd forth a broken song. Then came a groan— A rush, as if of thunder; and the earth From yawning clefts breathed forth volcanic flames, While the huge fabric, rocking to its base, A ruin seem'd. A miserable mass Of tortured life roll'd through the burning gates, And spread terrific o'er the parching soil, Like blacken'd lava. Then there was a pause. As if the dire convulsion mourned its wreck. To the rent walls the sad survivors clung, And, even 'mid smouldering fires, the artificers Wrought to uprear the pile. But all at once A bugle blast was heard—a courser's tramp— While a stern warrior waved his sword, and cried, “Away! away!” Like dreams the pageant fled, Monarch, and royal dame, and nobles proud. So there he stood alone, array'd in power Supreme and self-derived. Where the rude Alps Mock with their battlements the bowing cloud, His eagle-banner stream'd. Pale Gallia pour'd Incense as to an idol, mixed with blood Of her young conscript hearts. Chain'd in wild wrath, The Austrian lion couch'd; even Cæsar's realm Cast down its crown pontifical, and bade The Eternal city lay her lip in dust. The Land of Pyramids bent darkly down, And from the subject nations rose a voice Of wretchedness that awed the trembling globe. Earth, slowly rising from her thousand thrones, Did homage to the Corsican, as he The favor'd patriarch in his dream beheld Heaven, with her sceptred blazonry of stars, Bow to a reaper's sheaf. But fickle man, Though like the sea he boast himself awhile, Hath bounds to his supremacy. I saw A listed field, where the embattled kings Drew in deep wrath their armed legions on. The self-crown'd warrior blench'd not, and his sword Gleam'd like the flashing lightning, when it cleaves The vaulted firmament. In vain, in vain! The hour of fate had come. From a fair isle, 'Gainst whose bold rocks the foil'd Pacific roars, I heard above the troubled surge, the moan Of a chafed spirit warring with its lot; And there, where every element conspired To make Ambition's prison doubly sure, The mighty warrior gnaw'd his chain, and died. ROBERT C. SANDS YAMOYDEN. PROEM. Go forth, sad fragments of a broken strain, The last that either bard shall e'er essay; The hand can ne'er attempt the chords again, That first awoke them, in a happier day: Where sweeps the ocean breeze its desert way, His requiem murmurs o'er the moaning wave; And he who feebly now prolongs the lay, Shall ne'er the minstrel's hallowed honors crave; His harp lies buried deep in that untimely grave! Friend of my youth! with thee began the love Of sacred song; the wont, in golden dreams, 'Mid classic realms of splendors past to rove, O'er haunted steep, and by immortal streams; Where the blue wave, with sparkling bosom gleams Round shores, the mind's eternal heritage, For ever lit by memory's twilight beams; Where the proud dead, that live in storied page, Beckon, with awful port, to glory's earlier age. There would we linger oft, entranced, to hear, O'er battle fields, the epic thunders roll; Or list, where tragic wail upon the ear, Through Argive palaces shrill echoing, stole; There would we mark, uncurb'd by all control, In central heaven, the Theban eagle's flight; Or hold communion with the musing soul Of sage or bard, who sought, 'mid Pagan night, In loved Athenian groves, for truth's eternal light. Homeward we turn'd to that fair land, but late Redeem'd from the strong spell that bound it fast, Where Mystery, brooding o'er the waters, sate And kept the key, till three millenniums past; When, as creation's noblest work was last, Latest, to man it was vouchsafed, to see Nature's great wonder, long by clouds o'ercast, And veil'd in sacred awe, that it might be An empire and a home, most worthy for the free. And here, forerunners strange and meet were found, Of that blest freedom, only dream'd before;— Dark were the morning mists, that linger'd round Their birth and story, as the hue they bore. “Earth was their mother;”—or they knew no more, Or would not that their secret should be told; For they were grave and silent; and such lore, To stranger ears, they loved not to unfold, The long-transmitted tales, their sires were taught of old. Kind nature's commoners, from her they drew Their needful wants, and learnt not how to hoard; And him whom strength and wisdom crown'd, they knew, But with no servile reverence, as their lord. And on their mountain summits they adored One great, good Spirit, in his high abode, And thence their incense and orisons pour'd To his pervading presence, that abroad They felt through all his works,—their Father, King, and God. And in the mountain mist, the torrent's spray, The quivering forest, or the glassy flood, Soft falling showers, or hues of orient day, They imaged spirits beautiful and good; But when the tempest roar'd, with voices rude, Or fierce, red lightning fired the forest pine, Or withering heats untimely sear'd the wood, The angry forms they saw of powers malign; These they besought to spare, those blest for aid divine. As the fresh sense of life, through every vein, With the pure air they drank, inspiring came, Comely they grew, patient of toil and pain, And, as the fleet deer's, agile was their frame; Of meaner vices scarce they knew the name; These simple truths went down from sire to son,— To reverence age,—the sluggish hunter's shame, And craven warrior's infamy, to shun,— And still avenge each wrong, to friends or kindred done. From forest shades they peer'd, with awful dread, When, uttering flame and thunder from its side, The ocean-monster, with broad wings outspread, Came, ploughing gallantly the virgin tide. Few years have past, and all their forests' pride From shores and hills has vanish'd, with the race, Their tenants erst, from memory who have died, Like airy shapes, which eld was wont to trace, In each green thicket's depths, and lone, sequester'd place. And many a gloomy tale Tradition yet Saves from oblivion, of their struggles vain, Their prowess and their wrongs, for rhymer meet, To people scenes, where still their names remain; —And so began our young, delighted strain, That would evoke the plumed chieftains brave, And bid their martial hosts arise again, Where Narragansett's tides roll by their grave, And Haup's romantic steeps are piled above the wave. Friend of my youth! with thee began my song, And o'er thy bier its latest accents die; Misled in phantom-peopled realms too long,— Though not to me the muse averse deny, Sometimes, perhaps, her visions to descry,— Such thriftless pastime should with youth be o'er; And he who loved with thee his notes to try, But for thy sake such idlesse would deplore,— And swears to meditate the thankless muse no more. But no! the freshness of that past shall still Sacred to memory's holiest musings be; When through the ideal fields of song, at will, He roved, and gather'd chaplets wild with thee; When, reckless of the world, alone and free, Like two proud barks, we kept our careless way, That sail by moonlight o'er the tranquil sea; Their white apparel and their streamers gay, Bright gleaming o'er the main, beneath the ghostly ray;— And downward, far, reflected in the clear Blue depths, the eye their fairy tackling sees; So, buoyant, they do seem to float in air, And silently obey the noiseless breeze;— Till, all too soon, as the rude winds may please, They part for distant ports: The gales benign Swift wafting, bore, by Heaven's all-wise decrees, To its own harbor sure, where each divine And joyous vision, seen before in dreams, is thine. Muses of Helicon! melodious race Of Jove and golden-hair'd Mnemosyne! Whose art from memory blots each sadder trace, And drives each scowling form of grief away! Who, round the violet fount, your measures gay Once trod, and round the altar of great Jove; Whence, wrapt in silvery clouds, your nightly way Ye held, and ravishing strains of music wove, That soothed the Thunderer's soul, and fill'd his courts above. Bright choir! with lips untempted, and with zone Sparkling, and unapproach'd by touch profane; Ye, to whose gladsome bosoms ne'er was known The blight of sorrow, or the throb of pain;— Rightly invoked,—if right the elected swain, On your own mountain's side ye taught of yore, Whose honor'd hand took not your gift in vain, Worthy the budding laurel-bough it bore,— Farewell! a long farewell! I worship you no more! Know ye the Indian warrior race? How their light form springs in strength and grace, Like the pine on their native mountain side, That will not bow in its deathless pride; Whose rugged limbs of stubborn tone No flexuous power of art will own, But bend to Heaven's red bolt alone! How their hue is deep as the western die That fades in Autumn's evening sky; That lives for ever upon their brow, In the summer's heat, and the winter's snow; How their raven locks of tameless strain, Stream like the desert courser's mane: How their glance is far as the eagle's flight, And fierce and true as the panther's sight: How their souls are like the crystal wave, Where the spirit dwells in the northen cave; Unruffled in its cavern'd bed, Calm lies its glimmering surface spread; Its springs, its outlet unconfess'd, The pebble's weight upon its breast Shall wake its echoing thunders deep, And when their muttering accents sleep, Its dark recesses hear them yet, And tell of deathless love or hate! SONG. They say that afar in the land of the west, Where the bright golden sun sinks in glory to rest, 'Mid fens where the hunter ne'er ventured to tread, A fair lake unruffled and sparkling is spread; Where, lost in his course, the rapt Indian discovers, In distance seen dimly, the green isle of lovers. There verdure fades never; immortal in bloom, Soft waves the magnolia its groves of perfume; And low bends the branch with rich fruitage depress'd, All glowing like gems in the crowns of the east; There the bright eye of nature, in mild glory hovers: 'T is the land of the sunbeam,—the green isle of lovers! Sweet strains wildly float on the breezes that kiss The calm-flowing lake round that region of bliss; Where, wreathing their garlands of amaranth, fair choirs Glad measures still weave to the sound that inspires The dance and the revel, 'mid forests that cover On high with their shade the green isle of the lover. But fierce as the snake with his eyeballs of fire, When his scales are all brilliant and glowing with ire, Are the warriors to all, save the maids of their isle, Whose law is their will, and whose life is their smile; From beauty there valor and strength are not rovers, And peace reigns supreme in the green isle of lovers. And he who has sought to set foot on its shore, In mazes perplex'd, has beheld it no more; It fleets on the vision, deluding the view, Its banks still retire as the hunters pursue; O! who in this vain world of wo shall discover, The home undisturb'd, the green isle of the lover! ODE TO THE MANITTO OF DREAMS. Spirit! thou spirit of subtlest air, Whose power is upon the brain, When wondrous shapes, and dread, and fair, As the film from the eyes At thy bidding flies, To sight and sense are plain! Thy whisper creeps where leaves are stirr'd; Thou sighest in woodland gale; Where waters are gushing thy voice is heard; And when stars are bright, At still midnight, Thy symphonies prevail! Where the forest ocean, in quick commotion, Is waving to and fro, Thy form is seen, in the masses green, Dimly to come and go. From thy covert peeping, where thou layest sleeping, Beside the brawling brook, Thou art seen to wake, and thy flight to take Fleet from thy lonely nook. Where the moonbeam has kiss'd The sparkling tide, In thy mantle of mist Thou art seen to glide. Far o'er the blue waters Melting away, On the distant billow, As on a pillow, Thy form to lay. Where the small clouds of even Are wreathing in heaven Their garland of roses, O'er the purple and gold, Whose hangings enfold The hall that encloses The couch of the sun, Whose empire is done,— There thou art smiling, For thy sway is begun; Thy shadowy sway, The senses beguiling, When the light fades away, And thy vapor of mystery o'er nature ascending, The heaven and the earth, The things that have birth, And the embryos that float in the future is blending. From the land, on whose shores the billows break The sounding waves of the mighty lake; From the land where boundless meadows be, Where the buffalo ranges wild and free; With silvery cot in his little isle, Where the beaver plies his ceaseless toil; The land where pigmy forms abide, Thou leadest thy train at the even tide; And the wings of the wind are left behind, So swift through the pathless air they glide. Then to the chief who has fasted long, When the chains of his slumber are heavy and strong, Spirit! thou comest; he lies as dead, His wearied lids are with heaviness weigh'd; But his soul is abroad on the hurricane's pinion, Where foes are met in the rush of fight, In the shadowy world of thy dominion Conquering and slaying, till morning light! Then shall the hunter who waits for thee, The land of the game rejoicing see Through the leafless wood, O'er the frozen flood, And the trackless snows His spirit goes, Along the sheeted plain, Where the hermit bear, in his sullen lair, Keeps his long fast, till the winter hath past, And the boughs have budded again. Spirit of dreams! all thy visions are true, Who the shadow hath seen, he the substance shall view! Thine the riddle, strange and dark, Woven in the dreamy brain;— Thine to yield the power to mark Wandering by, the dusky train; Warrior ghosts for vengeance crying, Scalp'd on the lost battle's plain, Or who died their foes defying, Slow by lingering tortures slain. Thou the war-chief hovering near, Breathest language on his ear; When his winged words depart, Swift as arrows to the heart; When his eye the lightning leaves; When each valiant bosom heaves; Through the veins when hot and glowing Rage like liquid fire is flowing; Round and round the war pole whirling, Furious when the dancers grow; When the maces swift are hurling Promised vengeance on the foe; Thine assurance, Spirit true! Glorious victory gives to view! When of thought and strength despoil'd, Lies the brave man like a child; When discolor'd visions fly, Painful, o'er his gazing eye, And wishes wild through his darkness rove, Like flitting wings through the tangled grove,— Thine is the wish; the vision thine, And thy visits, Spirit! are all divine! When the dizzy senses spin, And the brain is madly reeling, Like the Pow-wah, when first within The present spirit feeling; When rays are flashing athwart the gloom, Like the dancing lights of the northern heaven, When voices strange of tumult come On the ear, like the roar of battle driven,— The Initiate then shall thy wonders see, And thy priest, O Spirit! is full of thee! Spirit of dreams! away! away! It is thine hour of solemn sway; And thou art holy; and our rite Forbids thy presence here tonight. Go light on lids that wake to pain; Triumphant visions yield again! If near the Christian's cot thou roam, Tell him the fire has wrapt his home: Where the mother lies in peaceful rest, Her infant slumbering on her breast, Tell her the red man hath seized its feet, And against a tree its brains doth beat: Fly to the bride who sleeps alone, Her husband forth for battle gone; Tell her, at morn,—and tell her true,— His head on the bough her eyes shall view; While his limbs shall be the raven's prey:— Spirit of dreams! away! away! SONG OF THE POW-WAHS. Beyond the hills the Spirit sleeps, His watch the power of evil keeps; The Spirit of fire has sought his bed, The Sun, the hateful Sun is dead. Profound and clear is the sounding wave, In the chambers of the Wakon-cave; Darkness its ancient portal keeps; And there the Spirit sleeps,—he sleeps. Come round on raven pinions now, Spirits of ill, to you we bow! Whether ye sit on the topmost cliff, While the storm around is sweeping, 'Mid the thunder shock, from rock to rock To view the lightning leaping; As ye guide the bolt, where towers afar The knotted pine to heaven, And where it falls, your serpent scar On the blasted trunk is graven:— Whether your awful voices pour Their tones in gales that nightly roar;— Whether ye dwell beneath the lake, In whose depths eternal thunders wake,— Gigantic guard the glittering ore, That lights Maurepas' haunted shore,— On Manataulin's lonely isle, The wanderer of the wave beguile,— Or love the shore where the serpent-hiss And angry rattle never cease,— Come round on raven pinion's now! Spirits of evil! to you we bow. Come ye hither, who o'er the thatch Of the coward murderer hold your watch; Moping and chattering round who fly Where the putrid members reeking lie, Piece-meal dropping, as they decay, O'er the shuddering recreant day by day; Till he loathes the food that is whelm'd amid The relics, by foul corruption hid; And the crawling worms about him bred Mistake the living for the dead! Come ye who give power To the curse that is said, And a charm that shall wither To the drops that are shed On the cheek of the maiden, Who never shall hear The kind name of Mother Saluting her ear; But sad as the turtle On the bare branch reclining, She shall sit in the desert, Consuming and pining; With a grief that is silent, Her beauty shall fade, Like a flower nipt untimely, On its stem that is dead. Come ye who as hawks hover o'er The spot where the war-club is lying, Defiled with the stain of their gore, The foemen to battle defying; On your dusky wings wheeling above, Who for vengeance and slaughter come crying: For the scent of the carnage ye love, The groans of the wounded and dying. Come ye, who at the sick man's bed, Watch beside his burning head; When the vaunting juggler tries in vain Charm and fast to soothe his pain, And his fever-balm and herbs applies, Your death watch ye sound till your victim dies. And ye who delight The soul to affright, When naked and lonely, Her dwelling forsaken, To the country of spirits Her journey is taken; When the wings of a dove She has borrow'd to fly, Ye swoop from above, And around her ye cry; She wanders and lingers In terror and pain, While the souls of her kindred Expect her in vain. By all the hopes that we forswear; By the potent rite we here prepare; By every shriek whose echo falls Around the Spirit's golden walls; By our eternal league made good; By all our wrongs and all our blood; By the red battle-axe uptorn; By the deep vengeance we have sworn; By the uprooted trunk of peace, And by the wrath that shall not cease, Where'er ye be, above, below, Spirits of ill! we call ye now! ROBERT DINSMOOR THE BRAES OF GLENNIFFER. Keen blaws the wind o'er the braes o' Glenniffer, The auld castle turrets are cover'd wi' snaw! How changed sin' the time that I met wi' my lover, Amang the green bushes by Stantley green shaw! The wild flowers o' simmer were springing sae bonny, The mavis sang sweet frae the green birken tree! But far to the camp they hae march'd my dear Jonnie, An' now it is winter wi' nature an' me. Then ilk thing around us was blithsome an' cheerie, Then ilk thing around us was bonnie an' braw; Now naething is heard but the wind whistling dreary, Now naething is seen but the wide spreading snaw. The trees are a' bare, an' the birds mute an' dowie, They shake the cauld drift frae their wings as they flee; They chirp out their plaints seeming wae for my Jonnie, 'T is winter wi' them, an' its winter wi' me. Yon cauld sleety cloud as it skiffs the bleak mountain, An' shakes the dark firs on its stey rocky brae, While down the deep glen bawls the snaw-flooded fountain, That murmur'd sae sweet to my laddie an' me. 'T is na the loud roar o' the wintry wind swallowin, 'Tis na the cauld blast brings the tear i' my e'e; For O gin I saw but my bonnie Scot's callan. The dark days o' winter were simmer to me. SAMUEL WOODWORTH THE BUCKET. How dear to this heart are the scenes of my childhood! When fond recollection presents them to view; The orchard, the meadow, the deep tangled wild wood, And every loved spot which my infancy knew; The wide spreading pond, and the mill which stood by it, The bridge, and the rock where the cataract fell; The cot of my father, the dairy house nigh it, And e'en the rude bucket which hung in the well. The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket, The moss-cover'd bucket which hung in the well. That moss-cover'd vessel I hail as a treasure, For often at noon, when return'd from the field, I found it the source of an exquisite pleasure, The purest and sweetest that nature can yield. How ardent I seized it with hands that were glowing, And quick to the white pebbled bottom it fell, Then soon with the emblem of truth overflowing, And dripping with coolness, it rose from the well. The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket, The moss-cover'd bucket arose from the well. How sweet from the green mossy brim to receive it, As poised on the curb it inclined to my lips: Not a full blushing goblet could tempt me to leave it, Though fill'd with the nectar that Jupiter sips. And now far removed from the loved situation, The tear of regret will intrusively swell, As fancy reverts to my father's plantation, And sighs for the bucket which hangs in the well. The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket, The moss-cover'd bucket which hangs in his well. THE LANDSEND. The gale was propitious, all canvas was spread, As swift through the water we glided, And the tear drop yet glisten'd which friendship had shed, Though the pang whence it sprang had subsided. Fast faded in distance each object we knew, As the shores which we loved were retiring, And the last grateful object which linger'd in view, Was the beacon on landsend aspiring. Ah! here, I exclaim'd, is an emblem of life, For 't is but a turbulent ocean, Where passion with reason is ever at strife, While our frail little barks are in motion. The haven of infancy, calm and serene, We leave in the distance retiring, While memory lingers to gaze on some scene, Like the beacon on landsend aspiring. O may I be careful to steer by that chart, Which wisdom in mercy has given, And true like the needle, this tremulous heart, Be constantly pointing to heaven. Thus safely with tempests and billows I'll cope, And find, when at last they're subsiding, On the landsend of life there's a beacon of hope, To the harbor of happiness guiding. LOVE'S EYES. Love's eyes are so enchanting, Bright, smiling, soft and granting, Pulses play at every ray, And hearts at every glance are panting. Before the beamy eye of morn We view the clouds of night receding; So tender glances banish scorn, For who can frown while Love is pleading? Love's eyes are so enchanting, &amp;c. No bandage can those eyes conceal, Though bards in fabled tales rehearse it; For if we wore a mask of steel, Affection's ardent gaze would pierce it. Love's eyes are so enchanting, &amp;c. Beware, then, lest some artful elf The infant's smiles and armor borrow, To win a throb of joy for self, And give his victims years of sorrow. Love's eyes are so enchanting, &amp;c. THE PRIDE OF THE VALLEY. The pride of the valley is lovely young Ellen, Who dwells in a cottage enshrined by a thicket, Sweet peace and content are the wealth of her dwelling, And Truth is the porter that waits at the wicket. The zephyr that lingers on violet-down pinion, With Spring's blushing honors delighted to dally, Ne'er breathed on a blossom in Flora's dominion, So lovely as Ellen, the pride of the valley. She 's true to her Willie, and kind to her mother, Nor riches nor honors can tempt her from duty; Content with her station, she sighs for no other, Though fortunes and titles have knelt to her beauty. To me her affections and promise are plighted, Our ages are equal, our tempers will tally; O moment of rapture, that sees me united To lovely young Ellen, the pride of the valley. WREATH OF LOVE. Let Fame her wreath for others twine, The fragrant Wreath of Love be mine, With balm-distilling blossoms wove; Let the shrill trumpet's hoarse alarms Bid laurels grace the victor's arms, Where havoc's blood-stain'd banners move. Be mine to wake the softer notes Where Acidalia's banner floats, And wear the gentler Wreath of Love. The balmy rose let stoics scorn, Let squeamish mortals dread the thorn, And fear the pleasing pain to prove; I'll fearless bind it to my heart, While every pang its thorns impart, The floweret's balsam shall remove; For, sweeten'd by the nectar'd kiss, 'T is pain that gives a zest to bliss, And freshens still the Wreath of Love. Give me contentment, peace, and health, A moderate share of worldly wealth, And friends such blessings to improve; A heart to give when misery pleads, To heal each rankling wound that bleeds, And every mental pain remove; But with these give—else all deny— The fair for whom I breathe the sigh, And wedlock be a Wreath of Love. Connubial bliss, unknown to strife, A faithful friend—a virtuous wife, Be mine for many years to prove: Our wishes one, within each breast The dove of peace shall make her nest, Nor ever from the ark remove; Till call'd to heaven, through ages there Be ours the blissful lot to wear A never fading Wreath of Love. JOHN PIERPONT. AIRS OF PALESTINE. At the dun cloud that, slowly rising, holds The Summer tempest in its gloomy folds, Though, o'er the ridges of its thundering breast, The King of Terrors rides, and shakes his lightning crest, Fearless we gaze, when those dark folds we find Fringed with the golden light, that glows behind. So, when one language bound the human race, On Shinar's plain, round Babel's mighty base, Gloomily rose the minister of wrath; Dark was his frown, destructive was his path; That tower was blasted by the touch of heaven; That bond was burst—that race asunder driven: Yet, round the Avenger's brow, that frown'd above, Play'd Mercy's beams—the lambent light of Love. All was not lost, though busy Discord flung Repulsive accents from each jarring tongue; All was not lost; for Love one tie had twined, And Mercy dropp'd it, to connect mankind: One tie, whose airy filaments invest, Like Beauty's zone, the calm or stormy breast; Wake that to action, rule of this the strife, And, through the mazy labyrinths of life, Supply a faithful clue, to lead the lone And weary wanderer to his Father's throne. That tie is Music. How supreme her sway! How lovely is the Power that all obey! Dumb matter trembles at her thrilling shock; Her voice is echo'd by the desert rock; For her, the asp withholds the sting of death, And bares his fangs, but to inhale her breath; The royal lion leaves his desert lair, And, crouching, listens when she treads the air; And man, by wilder impulse driven to ill, Is tamed, and led by this enchantress still. Who ne'er has felt her hand assuasive steal Along his heart—That heart will never feel. 'T is hers to chain the passions, soothe the soul, To snatch the dagger, and to dash the bowl From Murder's hand; to smooth the couch of Care, Extract the thorns, and scatter roses there; Of pain's hot brow, to still the bounding throb, Despair's long sigh, and Grief's convulsive sob. How vast her empire! Turn through earth, through air, Your aching eye, you find her subjects there; Nor is the throne of heaven above her spell, Nor yet beneath it is the host of hell. To her, Religion owes her holiest flame: Her eye looks heaven-ward, for from heaven she came. And when Religion's mild and genial ray, Around the frozen heart begins to play, Music's soft breath falls on the quivering light; The fire is kindled, and the flame is bright; And that cold mass, by either power assail'd, Is warm'd—made liquid—and to heaven exhaled. Here let us pause:—the opening prospect view:— How fresh this mountain air!—how soft the blue, That throws its mantle o'er the length'ning scene! Those waving groves—those vales of living green— Those yellow fields—that lake's cerulean face, That meets, with curling smiles, the cool embrace Of roaring torrents, lull'd by her to rest;— That white cloud, melting on the mountain's breast: How the wide landscape laughs upon the sky! How rich the light that gives it to the eye! Where lies our path?—though many a vista call, We may admire, but cannot tread them all. Where lies our path?—a poet, and inquire What hills, what vales, what streams become the lyre? See, there Parnassus lifts his head of snow; See at his foot the cool Cephissus flow; There Ossa rises; there Olympus towers; Between them, Tempe breathes in beds of flowers, For ever verdant: and there Peneus glides Through laurels, whispering on his shady sides. Your theme is music:—Yonder rolls the wave, Where dolphins snatch'd Arion from his grave, Enchanted by his lyre:—Cithæron's shade Is yonder seen, where first Amphion play'd Those potent airs, that, from the yielding earth, Charm'd stones around him, and gave cities birth. And fast by Hæmus, Thracian Hebrus creeps O'er golden sands, and still for Orpheus weeps, Whose gory head, borne by the stream along, Was still melodious, and expired in song. There Nereids sing, and Triton winds his shell; There be thy path—for there the muses dwell. No, no—a lonelier, lovelier path be mine: Greece, and her charms, I leave, for Palestine. There, purer streams through happier valleys flow, And sweeter flowers on holier mountains blow. I love to breathe where Gilead sheds her balm; I love to walk on Jordan's banks of palm; I love to wet my foot in Hermon's dews; I love the promptings of Isaiah's muse: In Carmel's holy grots I'll court repose, And deck my mossy couch with Sharon's deathless rose. Here arching vines their leafy banner spread, Shake their green shields, and purple odors shed; At once repelling Syria's burning ray, And breathing freshness on the sultry day, Here the wild bee suspends her murmuring wing, Pants on the rock, or sips the silver spring; And here—as musing on my theme divine, I gather flowers to bloom along my line, And hang my garland in festoons around, Enwreath'd with clusters, and with tendrils bound; And fondly, warmly, humbly hope, the Power, That gave perfumes and beauty to the flower, Drew living water from this rocky shrine, Purpled the clustering honors of the vine, And led me, lost in devious mazes, hither, To weave a garland, will not let it wither:— Wond'ring, I listen to the strain sublime, That flows, all freshly down the stream of time, Wafted in grand simplicity along, The undying breath, the very soul of song. Down that long vale of years are sweetly roll'd The mingled voices of the bards of old; Melodious voices! bards of brightest fire! Where each is warm, how melting is the quire! Yet, though so blended is the concert blest, Some master tones are heard above the rest. O'er the cleft sea, the storm in fury rides: Israel is safe, and Egypt tempts the tides: Her host, descending, meets a wat'ry grave, And o'er her monarch rolls the refluent wave. The storm is hush'd: the billows foam no more, But sink in smiles: there 's Music on the shore. On the wide waste of waters, dies that air Unheard; for all is death and coldness there. But see! the robe that brooding Silence throws O'er Shur reclining in profound repose, Is rent, and scatter'd, by the bursts of praise, That swells the song th' astonish'd Hebrews raise. The desert waked at that proud anthem, flung From Miriam's timbrel and from Moses' tongue: The first to Liberty that e'er was sung. But if, when joy and gratitude inspire, Such high-toned triumph walks along the lyre, What are its breathings, when pale sorrow flings Her tearful touches o'er its trembling strings? At Nebo's base, that mighty bard resigns His life and empire in prophetic lines.— Heaven, all attention, round the poet bends, And conscious earth, as when the dew descends, Or showers as gentle, feels her young buds swell, Her herbs shoot greener, at that fond farewell. Rich is the song, though mournfully it flows: And as that harp, which God alone bestows, Is swept in concert with that sinking breath, Its cold chords shrink, as from the touch of death. It was the touch of death!—Sweet be thy slumbers, Harp of the prophet! but those holy numbers, That death-denoting, monitory moan. Shall live, till Nature heaves her dying groan, From Pisgah's top his eye the prophet threw, O'er Jordan's wave, where Canaan met his view. His sunny mantle and his hoary locks Shone, like the robe of Winter, on the rocks. Where is that mantle?—Melted into air. Where is the prophet?—God can tell thee where. So, on the brow of some romantic height, A fleecy cloud hangs hovering in the light, Fit couch for angels; which while yet we view, 'T is lost to earth, and all around is blue. Who is that Chief, already taught to urge The battle stream, and roll its darkest surge, Whose army marches through retiring seas, Whose gory banner spreading on the breeze, Unfolds o'er Jericho's devoted towers, And, like the storm o'er Sodom, redly lowers? The moon can answer; for she heard his tongue, And cold and pale o'er Ajalon she hung. The sun can tell:—O'er Gibeon's vale of blood, Curving their beamy necks, his coursers stood, Held by that hero's arm, to light his wrath, And roll their glorious eyes upon his crimson path. What mine, exploding, rends that smoking ground? What earthquake spreads those smouldering ruins round? The sons of Levi, round that city, bear The ark of God, their consecrated care, And, in rude concert, each returning morn, Blow the long trump, and wind the curling horn. No blackening thunder smoked along the wall: No earthquake shook it:—Music wrought its fall. The reverend hermit, who from earth retires, Freezes to love's, to melt in holier fires, And builds on Libanus his humble shed, Beneath the waving cedars of his head;— Year after year, with brighter views revolving, Doubt after doubt, in stronger hopes dissolving;— Though neither pipe, nor voice, nor organ's swell, Disturb the silence of his lonely cell; Yet hears enough, had nought been heard before, To wake a holy awe, and teach him to adore. For, ere the day with orisons he closes, Ere on his flinty couch his head reposes, A couch more downy in the hermit's sight, Than beds of roses to the Sybarite; As lone he muses on those naked rocks, Heaven's last light blushing on his silver locks, Amid the deepening shades of that wild mountain, He hears the burst of many a mossy fountain, Whose crystal rills in pure embraces mingle, And dash, and sparkle down the leafy dingle, There lose their liquid notes:—with grateful glow, The hermit listens, as the waters flow, And says there 's Music in that mountain stream, The storm beneath him, and the eagle's scream. There lives around that solitary man, The tameless music, that with time began; Airs of the Power, that bids the tempest roar, The cedar bow, the royal eagle soar; The mighty Power, by whom those rocks were piled, Who moves unseen, and murmurs through the wild. What countless chords does that dread Being strike! Various their tone, but all divine alike: There, Mercy whispers in a balmy breath, Here, Anger thunders, and the note is death; There, 't is a string that soothes with slow vibration, And here, a burst that shakes the whole creation. By heaven forewarn'd, his hunted life to save, Behold Elijah stands by Horeb's cave; Grieved that the God, for whom he'd warmly striven, Should see his servants into exile driven, His words neglected, by those servants spoken, His prophets murder'd, and his altars broken. His bleeding heart a soothing strain requires: He hears it:—softer than Æolian lyres, “A still, small voice,” like Zephyr's dying sighs, Steals on his ear:—he may not lift his eyes, But o'er his face his flowing mantle flings, And hears a whisper from the King of kings. Yet, from that very cave, from Horeb's side, Where spreads a desert prospect, wild and wide, The prophet sees, with reverential dread, Dark Sinai rear his thunder-blasted head; Where erst was pour'd on trembling Israel's ear, A stormier peal, that Moses quaked to hear. In what tremendous pomp Jehovah shone, When on that mount he fix'd his burning throne! Thick, round its base, a shuddering gloom was flung; Black, on its breast, a thunder-cloud was hung: Bright, through that blackness, arrowy lightnings came, Shot from the glowing vail, that wrapp'd its head in flame. And when that quaking mount the Eternal trod, Scorch'd by the foot of the descending God, Then blasts of unseen trumpets, long and loud, Swell'd by the breath of whirlwinds, rent the cloud, And Death and Terror stalk'd, beneath that smoky shroud. Seest thou that shepherd boy, of features fair, Of eye serene, and brightly flowing hair, That leans, in thoughtful posture, on his crook, And, statue-like, pores o'er the pebbly brook? Yes: and why stands he there, in stupor cold? Why not pursue those wanderers from his fold? Or, 'mid the playful children of his flocks, Toss his light limbs, and shake his amber locks, Rather than idly gaze upon the stream?— That boy is lost in a poetic dream: And, while his eye follows the wave along, His soul expatiates in the realm of song. For oft, where yonder grassy hills recede, I 've heard that shepherd tune his rustic reed; And then such sweetness from his fingers stole, I knew that Music had possess'd his soul. Oft, in her temple shall the votary bow, Oft, at her altar breathe his ardent vow, And oft suspend, along her coral walls, The proudest trophies that adorn her halls. Even now, the heralds of his monarch tear The son of Jesse from his fleecy care, And to the hall the ruddy minstrel bring, Where sits a being, that was once a king. Still, on his brow, the crown of Israel gleams, And cringering courtiers still adore its beams, Though the bright circle throws no light divine, But rays of hell, that melt it while they shine. As the young harper tries each quivering wire, It leaps and sparkles with prophetic fire, And, with the kindling song, the kindling rays Around his fingers tremulously blaze, Till the whole hall, like those bless'd fields above, Glows with the light of melody and love. Soon as the foaming demon hears that psalm, Heaven on his memory bursts, and Eden's balm; He sees the dawning of too bright a sky; Detects the angel in the poet's eye; With grasp convulsive, rends his matted hair; Through his strain'd eye-balls shoots a fiend-like glare; And flies, with shrieks of agony, that hall, The throne of Israel, and the breast of Saul; Exiled to roam, or, in infernal pains, To seek a refuge from that shepherd's strains. The night was moonless:—Judah's shepherds kept Their starlight watch: their flocks around them slept. To heaven's blue fields their wakeful eyes were turn'd, And to the fires that there eternal burn'd. Those azure regions had been peopled long, With Fancy's children, by the sons of song: And there, the simple shepherd, conning o'er His humble pittance of Chaldean lore, Saw, in the stillness of a starry night, The Swan and Eagle wing their silent flight; And, from their spangled pinions, as they flew, On Israel's vales of verdure shower the dew: Saw there, the brilliant gems, that nightly flare, In the thin mist of Berenice's hair; And there, Boötes roll his lucid wain, On sparkling wheels, along the etherial plain; And there, the Pleiades, in tuneful gyre, Pursue for ever the star-studded Lyre; And there, with bickering lash, heaven's Charioteer Urge round the Cynosure his bright career. While thus the shepherds watch'd the host of night, O'er heaven's blue concave flash'd a sudden light. The unrolling glory spread its folds divine, O'er the green hills and vales of Palestine; And lo! descending angels, hovering there, Stretch'd their loose wings, and in the purple air, Hung o'er the sleepless guardians of the fold:— When that high anthem, clear, and strong, and bold On wavy paths of trembling ether ran: “Glory to God;—Benevolence to man;— Peace to the world:”—and in full concert came, From silver tubes, and harps of golden frame, The loud and sweet response, whose choral strains Linger'd and languish'd on Judea's plains. Yon living lamps, charm'd from their chambers blue, By airs so heavenly, from the skies withdrew: All?—all, but one, that hung and burn'd alone, And with mild lustre over Bethlehem shone. Chaldea's sages saw that orb afar, Glow unextinguish'd;—'t was Salvation's Star. Hear'st thou that solemn symphony, that swells And echoes through Philippi's gloomy cells? From vault to vault the heavy notes rebound, And granite rocks reverberate the sound. The wretch, who long, in dungeons cold and dank, Had shook his fetters, that their iron clank Might break the grave-like silence of that prison, On which the Star of Hope had never risen; Then sunk in slumbers, by despair oppress'd, And dream'd of freedom in his broken rest; Wakes at the music of those mellow strains, Thinks it some spirit, and his chains. 'T is Paul and Silas; who, at midnight, pay To him of Nazareth a grateful lay. Soon is that anthem wasted to the skies: An angel bears it, and a God replies. At that reply, a pale, portentous light Plays through the air,—then leaves a gloomier night. The darkly tottering towers,—the trembling arch,— The rocking walls confess an earthquake's march,— The stars look dimly through the roof:—behold, From saffron dews and melting clouds of gold, Brightly uncurling on the dungeon's air, Freedom walks forth serene:—from her loose hair, And every glistening feather of her wings, Perfumes that breathe of more than earth she flings, And with a touch dissolves the prisoner's chains, Whose song had charm'd her from celestial plains. 'T is night again: for Music loves to steal Abroad at night; when all her subjects kneel, In more profound devotion, at her throne: And, at that sober hour, she'll sit alone, Upon a bank, by her sequester'd cell, And breathe her sorrows through her wreathed shell. Again 't is night—the diamond lights on high, Burn bright, and dance harmonious through the sky: And Silence leads her downy-footed hours, Round Sion's hill, and Salem's holy towers. The Lord of Life, with his few faithful friends, Drown'd in mute sorrow, down that hill descends. They cross the stream that bathes its foot, and dashes Around the tomb, where sleep a monarch's ashes; And climb the steep, where oft the midnight air Received the Sufferer's solitary prayer. There, in dark bowers imbosom'd, Jesus flings His hand celestial o'er prophetic strings; Displays his purple robe, his bosom gory, His crown of thorns, his cross, his future glory:— And, while the group, each hallow'd accent gleaming, On pilgrim's staff, in pensive posture leaning— Their reverend beards, that sweep their bosoms, wet With the chill dews of shady Olivet— Wonder and weep, they pour the song of sorrow, With their loved Lord, whose death shall shroud the morrow. Heavens! what a strain was that! those matchless tones, That ravish “Princedoms, Dominations, Thrones;” That, heard on high, had hush'd those peals of praise, That seraphs swell, and harping angels raise, Soft, as the wave from Siloa's fount that flows, Through the drear silence of the mountain rose. How sad the Saviour's song! how sweet! how holy! The last he sung on earth:—how melancholy! Along the valley sweep the expiring notes: On Kedron's wave the melting music floats: From her blue arch, the lamp of evening flings Her mellow lustre, as the Saviour sings: The moon above, the wave beneath is still, And light and music mingle on the hill. The glittering guard, whose viewless ranks invest The brook's green margin, and the mountain's crest, Catch that unearthly song, and soar away, Leave this dark orb, for fields of endless day, And round the Eternal's throne on buoyant pinions play. Ye glowing seraphs, that enchanted swim, In seas of rapture, as ye tune the hymn Ye bore from earth—O say, ye choral quires, Why in such haste to wake your golden lyres? Why, like a flattering, like a fleeting dream, Leave that lone mountain, and that silent stream? Say, could not then the “Man of Sorrows” claim Your shield of adamant, your sword of flame?— Hell forced a smile, at your retiring wing, And man was left—to crucify your King. But must no other sweets perfume my wreath, Than Carmel's hill and Sharon's valley breathe? Are holy airs borne only through the skies, Where Sinai thunders, and where Horeb sighs? And move they only o'er Arabia's sea, Bethesda's pool, the lake of Galilee? And does the hand that bids Judea bloom, Deny its blossoms to the desert's gloom? No:—turn thine eye, in visionary glance, To scene's beyond old ocean's blue expanse, Where vast La Plata rolls his weight along, Through worlds unknown to science and to song, And, sweeping proudly o'er his boundless plain, Repels the foaming billows of the main. Let Fancy lap thee in Paraguay's bowers, And scatter round thee Nature's wildest flowers: For Nature there, since first her opening eye Hail'd the bright orb her Father hung on high, Still, on her bosom wears the enamel'd vest, That bloom'd and budded on her infant breast; Still, to the sportive breeze that round her blows, Turns her warm cheek, her unshorn tresses throws; With grateful hand her treasured balm bequeaths, For every sigh the enamor'd rover breathes, And even smiles to feel the flutterer sip The virgin dew that cools her rosy lip. There, through the clouds, stupendous mountains rise, And lift their icy foreheads to the skies; There, blooming valleys and secure retreats Bathe all thy senses in voluptuous sweets: Reclining there, beneath a bending tree, Fraught with the fragrant labors of the bee, Admire, with me, the birds of varied hue, That hang, like flowers of orange and of blue, Among the broad magnolia's cups of snow, Quaffing the perfumes, from those cups that flow. But, is all peace, beneath the mountain shade? Do Love and Mercy haunt that sunny glade, And sweetly rest upon that lovely shore, When light retires, and nature smiles no more? No:—there, at midnight, the hoarse tiger growls: There, the gaunt wolf sits on his rock and howls: And there, in painted pomp, the yelling Indian prowls. Round the bold front of yon projecting cliff, Shoots, on white wings, the missionary's skiff, And, walking steadily along the tide, Seems, like a phantom, o'er the wave to glide, Her light cymar unfolded to the breeze, That breaks not, though it moves, the mirror of the seas. Lo, at the stern, the priest of Jesus rears His reverend front, plough'd by the share of years. He takes his harp:—the spirits of the air Breathe on his brow, and interweave his hair, In silky flexure, with the sounding strings:— And hark!—the holy missionary sings. 'T is the Gregorian chant:—with him unites, On either hand, his quire of neophytes, While the boat cleaves its liquid path along, And waters, woods, and winds protract the song. Those unknown strains the forest war-whoop hush: Huntsmen and warriors from their cabins rush, Heed not the foe, that yells defiance nigh, See not the deer that dashes wildly by, Drop from their hand the bow and rattling quiver, Crowd to the shore, and plunge into the river, Breast the green waves, the enchanted bark that toss, Leap o'er her sides, and kneel before the cross. Hear yon poetic pilgrim of the west, Chant Music's praise, and to her power attest. Who now, in Florida's untrodden woods, Bedecks, with vines of jessamine, her floods, And flowery bridges o'er them loosely throws;— Who hangs the canvas where Atala glows, On the live oak, in floating drapery shrouded, That like a mountain rises, lightly clouded;— Who, for the son of Outalissa, twines, Beneath the shade of ever whispering pines, A funeral wreath, to bloom upon the moss, That time already sprinkles on the cross, Raised o'er the grave, where his young virgin sleeps, And Superstition o'er her victim weeps;— Whom now, the silence of the dead surrounds, Among Scioto's monumental mounds; Save that, at times, the musing pilgrim hears A crumbling oak fall with the weight of years, To swell the mass that Time and Ruin throw, O'er chalky bones, that mouldering lie below, By virtues unembalm'd, unstain'd by crimes, Lost in those towering tombs of other times; For where no bard has cherish'd Virtue's flame, No ashes sleep in the warm sun of Fame.— With sacred lore this traveller beguiles His weary way, while o'er him Fancy smiles. Whether he kneels in venerable groves, Or through the wide and green savanna roves, His heart leaps lightly on each breeze, that bears The faintest cadence of Idumea's airs. Now, he recalls the lamentable wail, That pierced the shades of Rama's palmy vale When Murder struck, throned on an infant's bier, A note, for Satan's, and for Herod's ear. Now, on a bank, o'erhung with waving wood, Whose falling leaves flit o'er Ohio's flood, The pilgrim stands; and o'er his memory rushes The mingled tide of tears, and blood, that gushes Along the valleys, where his childhood stray'd, And round the temples where his father pray'd. How fondly then, from all but Hope exiled, To Zion's wo recurs Religion's child! He sees the tear of Judah's captive daughters Mingle, in silent flow, with Babel's waters; While Salem's harp, by patriot pride unstrung, Wrapp'd in the mist, that o'er the river hung, Felt but the breeze, that wanton'd o'er the billow, And the long, sweeping fingers of the willow. And could not Music soothe the captive's wo? But should that harp be strung for Judah's foe? While thus the enthusiast roams along the stream, Balanced between a revery and a dream, Backward he springs: and, through his bounding heart, The cold and curdling poison seems to dart. For, in the leaves, beneath a quivering brake, Spinning his death-note, lies a coiling snake, Just in the act, with greenly venom'd fangs, To strike the foot, that heedless o'er him hangs. Bloated with rage, on spiral folds he rides; His rough scales shiver on his spreading sides; Dusky and dim his glossy neck becomes, And freezing poisons thicken on his gums; His parch'd and hissing throat breathes hot and dry; A spark of hell lies burning on his eye: While, like a vapor, o'er his writhing rings, Whirls his light tail, that threatens while it sings. Soon as dumb Fear removes her icy fingers From off his heart, where gazing wonder lingers, The pilgrim, shrinking from a doubtful fight, Aware of danger, too, in sudden flight, From his soft flute throws Music's air around, And meets his foe, upon enchanted ground. See! as the plaintive melody is flung, The lightning flash fades on the serpent's tongue; The uncoiling reptile o'er each shining fold Throws changeful clouds of azure, green and gold; A softer lustre twinkles in his eye; His neck is burnish'd with a glossier dye; His slippery scales grow smoother to the sight, And his relaxing circles roll in light. Slowly the charm retires:—with waving sides, Along its tract the graceful listener glides; While Music throws her silver cloud around, And bears her votary off, in magic folds of sound. On Arno's bosom, as he calmly flows, And his cool arms round Vallombrosa throws, Rolling his crystal tide through classic vales, Alone,—at night,—the Italian boatman sails. High o'er Mont Alto walks, in maiden pride, Night's queen:—he sees her image on that tide, Now, ride the wave that curls its infant crest, Around his brow, then rippling sinks to rest; Now, glittering dance around his eddying oar, Whose every sweep is echoed from the shore; Now, far before him, on a liquid bed Of waveless water, rests her radiant head. How mild the empire of that virgin queen! How dark the mountain's shade! how still the scene! Hush'd by her silver sceptre, zephyrs sleep On dewy leaves, that overhang the deep, Nor dare to whisper through the boughs, nor stir The valley's willow, nor the mountain's fir, Nor make the pale and breathless aspen quiver, Nor brush, with ruffling wing, that glassy river. Hark!—'t is a convent's bell:—its midnight chime. For music measures even the march of Time:— O'er bending trees, that fringe the distant shore, Gray turrets rise:—the eye can catch no more. The boatman, listening to the tolling bell, Suspends his oar;—a low and solemn swell, From the deep shade, that round the cloister lies, Rolls through the air, and on the water dies. What melting song wakes the cold ear of night? A funeral dirge, that pale nuns, robed in white, Chant round a sister's dark and narrow bed, To charm the parting spirit of the dead. Triumphant is the spell! with raptured ear, That uncaged spirit hovering lingers near;— Why should she mount? why pant for brighter bliss, A lovelier scene, a sweeter song, than this? On Caledonia's hills, the ruddy morn Breathes fresh:—the huntsman winds his clamorous horn. The youthful minstrel from his pallet springs, Seizes his harp, and tunes its slumbering strings. Lark-like he mounts o'er gray rocks, thunder-riven, Lark-like he cleaves the white mist, tempest-driven, And lark-like carols, as the cliff he climbs, Whose oaks were vocal with his earliest rhymes. With airy foot he treads the giddy height; His heart all rapture, and his eye all light; His voice all melody, his yellow hair Floating and dancing on the mountain air, Shaking from its loose folds the liquid pearls, That gather clustering on his golden curls;— And, for a moment, gazes on a scene, Tinged with deep shade, dim gold, and brightening green; Then plays a mournful prelude, while the star Of morning fades:—but when heaven's gates unbar, And on the world a tide of glory rushes, Burns on the hill, and down the valley blushes; The mountain bard in livelier numbers sings, While sunbeams warm and gild the conscious strings, And his young bosom feels the enchantment strong, Of light, and joy, and minstrelsy, and song. From rising morn, the tuneful stripling roves, Through smiling valleys and religious groves; Hears there, the flickering blackbird strain his throat, Here, the lone turtle pour her mournful note, Till night descends, and round the wanderer flings The dew drops dripping from her dusky wings. Far from his native vale, and humble shed, By nature's smiles, and nature's music led, This child of melody has thoughtless stray'd, Till darkness wraps him in her deepening shade. The scene he smiled on, when array'd in light, Now lowers around him with the frown of night. With weary foot the nearest height he climbs, Crown'd with huge oaks, giants of other times; Who feel, but fear not autumn's breath, and cast Their summer robes upon the roaring blast, And glorying in their majesty of form, Toss their old arms, and challenge every storm. Below him, ocean rolls:—deep in a wood, Built on a rock, and frowning o'er the flood, Like the dark Cyclops of Trinacria's isle, Rises an old and venerable pile: Gothic its structure; once a cross it bore, And pilgrims throng'd to hail it and adore. Mitres and crosiers awed the trembling friar, The solemn organ led the chanting quire, When in those vaults the midnight dirge was sung, And o'er the dead, a requiescat rung.— Now, all is still:—the midnight anthem hush'd:— The cross is crumbled, and the crosier crush'd. And is all still?—No: round those ruin'd altars, With feeble foot as our musician falters, Faint, weary, lost, benighted, and alone, He sinks, all trembling, on the threshold stone. Here nameless fears the young enthusiast chill: They're superstitious, but religious still, He hears the sullen murmur of the seas, That tumble round the stormy Orcades, Or, deep beneath him, heave with boundless roar, Their sparkling surges to that savage shore; And thinks a spirit rolls the weltering waves Through rifted rocks, and hollow rumbling caves. Round the dark windows clasping ivy clings, Twines round the porch, and in the sea-breeze swings; Its green leaves rustle:—heavy winds arise: The low cells echo, and the dark hall sighs. Now Fancy sees th' ideal canvas stretch'd, And o'er the lines that Truth has dimly sketch'd, Dashes with hurried hand the shapes that fly Hurtled along before her frenzied eye. The scudding cloud that drives along the coast, Becomes the drapery of a warrior's ghost, Who sails serenely in his gloomy pall, O'er Morven's woods and Tura's mouldering wall, To join the feast of shells, in Odin's misty hall. Is that some demon's shriek, so loud and shrill, Whose flapping robes sweep o'er the stormy hill? No—'t is the mountain blast, that nightly rages, Around those walls, gray with the moss of ages. Is that a lamp sepulchral, whose pale light Shines in yon vault, before a spectre white? No:—'t is a glow-worm, burning greenly there, Or meteor, swimming slowly on the air. What mighty organ swells its deepest tone, And sighing heaves a low, funereal moan, That murmurs through the cemetery's glooms, And throws a deadlier horror round its tombs? Sure, some dread spirit o'er the keys presides! The same that lifts these darkly thundering tides; Or, homeless, shivers o'er an unclosed grave; Or shrieking, off at sea, bestrides the white-maned wave. Yes!—'t is some Spirit that those skies deforms, And wraps in billowy clouds that hill of storms. Yes:—'t is a Spirit in those vaults that dwells, Illumes that hall, and murmurs in those cells. Yes:—'t is some Spirit on the blast that rides, And wakes the eternal tumults of the tides. That Spirit broke the poet's morning dream, Led him o'er woody hill and babbling stream, Lured his young foot to every vale that rung, And charm'd his ear in every bird that sung; With various concerts cheer'd his hours of light, But kept the mightiest in reserve till night; Then, throned in darkness, peal'd that wildest air, Froze his whole soul, and chain'd the listener there. That mighty spirit once from Teman came: Clouds were his chariot, and his coursers flame. Bow'd the perpetual hills:—the rivers fled:— Green ocean trembled to his deepest bed:— Earth shrunk aghast,—eternal mountains burn'd, And his red axle thunder'd as it turn'd. O! thou dread Spirit! Being's End and Source! O! check thy chariot in its fervid course. Bend from thy throne of darkness and of fire, And with one smile immortalize our lyre. Amid the cloudy lustre of thy throne, Though wreathy tubes, unheard on earth, are blown, Swelling one ceaseless song of praise to thee, Eternal Author of Eternity! Still hast thou stoop'd to hear a shepherd play, To prompt his measures, and approve his lay. Hast thou grown old, Thou, who for ever livest! Hast thou forgotten, Thou, who memory givest! How, on the day thine ark, with loud acclaim, From Zion's hill to mount Moriah came, Beneath the wings of cherubim to rest, In a rich vail of Tyrian purple drest; When harps and cymbals join'd in echoing clang, When psalteries tinkled, and when trumpets rang, And white-robed Levites round thine altar sang! Thou didst descend, and, rolling through the crowd, Inshrine thine ark and altar in thy shroud, And fill the temple with thy mantling cloud. And now, Almighty Father, well we know, When humble strains from grateful bosoms flow, Those humble strains grow richer as they rise, And shed a balmier freshness on the skies. What though no cherubim are here display'd, No gilded walls, no cedar colonnade, No crimson curtains hang around our quire, Wrought by the ingenious artisan of Tyre; No doors of fir on golden hinges turn; No spicy gums in golden censers burn; No frankincense, in rising volumes, shrouds The fretted roof in aromatic clouds; No royal minstrel, from his ivory throne, Gives thee his father's numbers or his own;— If humble love, if gratitude inspire, Our strain shall silence even the temple's quire, And rival Michael's trump, nor yield to Gabriel's lyre In what rich harmony, what polish'd lays, Should man address thy throne, when nature pays Her wild, her tuneful tribute to the sky! Yes, Lord, she sings thee, but she knows not why. The fountain's gush, the long resounding shore, The zephyr's whisper, and the tempest's roar, The rustling leaf, in autumn's fading woods, The wintry storm, the rush of vernal floods, The summer bower, by cooling breezes fann'd, The torrent's fall, by dancing rainbows spann'd, The streamlet, gurgling through its rocky glen, The long grass, sighing o'er the graves of men, The bird that crests yon dew-bespangled tree, Shakes his bright plumes, and trills his descant free. The scorching bolt, that from thine armory hurl'd, Burns its red path, and cleaves a shrinking world; All these are music to Religion's ear:— Music, thy hand awakes, for man to hear. Thy hand invested in their azure robes, Thy breath made buoyant yonder circling globes, That bound and blaze along the elastic wires, That viewless vibrate on celestial lyres, And in that high and radiant concave tremble, Beneath whose dome adoring hosts assemble, To catch the notes, from those bright spheres that flow, Which mortals dream of, but which angels know. Before thy throne, three sister Graces kneel; Their holy influence let our bosoms feel! Faith, that with smiles light up our dying eyes; Hope, that directs them to the opening skies; And Charity, the loveliest of the three, That can assimilate a worm to thee. For her our organ breathes; to her we pay The heart-felt homage of an humble lay; And while to her symphonious chords we string, And Silence listens while to her we sing, While round thine altar swells our evening song, And vaulted roofs the dying notes prolong, The strain we pour to her, wilt thou approve, For Love is Charity, and Thou art Love. THE PILGRIM FATHERS. The pilgrim fathers—where are they? The waves that brought them o'er Still roll in the bay, and throw their spray As they break along the shore: Still roll in the bay, as they roll'd that day, When the May-Flower moor'd below, When the sea around was black with storms, And white the shore with snow. The mists, that wrapp'd the pilgrim's sleep, Still brood upon the tide; And his rocks yet keep their watch by the deep, To stay its waves of pride. But the snow-white sail, that he gave to the gale, When the heavens look'd dark, is gone;— As an angel's wing, through an opening cloud, Is seen, and then withdrawn. The pilgrim exile—sainted name!— The hill, whose icy brow Rejoiced, when he came, in the morning's flame, In the morning's flame burns now. And the moon's cold light, as it lay that night On the hill-side and the sea, Still lies where he laid his houseless head;— But the pilgrim—where is he? The pilgrim fathers are at rest: When Summer 's throned on high, And the world's warm breast is in verdure dress'd, Go, stand on the hill where they lie. The earliest ray of the golden day On that hallowed spot is cast; And the evening sun, as he leaves the world, Looks kindly on that spot last. The pilgrim spirit has not fled: It walks in noon's broad light; And it watches the bed of the glorious dead, With the holy stars, by night. It watches the bed of the brave who have bled, And shall guard this ice-bound shore, Till the waves of the bay, where the May-Flower lay, Shall foam and freeze no more. WARREN'S ADDRESS TO THE AMERICAN SOLDIERS, BEFORE THE BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL. Stand! the ground's your own, my braves! Will ye give it up to slaves? Will ye look for greener graves? Hope ye mercy still? What 's the mercy despots feel! Hear it in that battle peal! Read it on yon bristling steel! Ask it—ye who will. Fear ye foes who kill for hire! Will ye to your homes retire? Look behind you! they 're afire! And, before you, see Who have done it!—From the vale On they come!—and will ye quail?— Leaden rain and iron hail Let their welcome be! In the God of battles trust! Die we may—and die we must:— But, O, where can dust to dust Be consign'd so well, As where heaven its dews shall shed On the martyr'd patriot's bed, And the rocks shall raise their head, Of his deeds to tell! ON LAYING THE CORNER STONE OF THE BUNKER HILL MONUMENT. O, is not this a holy spot? 'T is the high place of freedom's birth! God of our fathers! is it not The holiest spot of all the earth? Quench'd is thy flame on Horeb's side; The robber roams o'er Sinai now; And those old men, thy seers, abide No more on Zion's mournful brow. But on this hill thou, Lord, hast dwelt, Since round its head the war-cloud curl'd, And wrapp'd our fathers, where they knelt In prayer and battle for a world. Here sleeps their dust: 't is holy ground: And we, the children of the brave, From the four winds are gather'd round, To lay our offering on their grave. Free as the winds around us blow, Free as the waves below us spread, We rear a pile, that long shall throw Its shadow on their sacred bed. But on their deeds no shade shall fall, While o'er their couch thy sun shall flame: Thine ear was bow'd to hear their call, And thy right hand shall guard their fame. INDEPENDENCE. Day of glory! welcome day! Freedom's banners greet thy ray; See! how cheerfully they play With thy morning breeze, On the rocks where pilgrims kneel'd, On the heights where squadrons wheel'd, When a tyrant's thunder peal'd, O'er the trembling seas. God of armies! did thy “stars In their courses” smite his cars, Blast his arm, and wrest his bars From the heaving tide? On our standard, lo! they burn, And, when days like this return, Sparkle o'er the soldier's urn, Who for freedom died. God of peace!—whose spirit fills All the echoes of our hills, All the murmurs of our rills, Now the storm is o'er;— O, let freemen be our sons; And let future Washingtons Rise, to lead their valiant ones, Till there 's war no more. By the patriot's hallow'd rest, By the warrior's gory breast, Never let our graves be press'd By a despot's throne: By the pilgrim's toil and cares, By their battles and their prayers, By their ashes,—let our heirs Bow to thee alone. FOR A LADY'S ALBUM. Grace is deceitful, and beauty vain.— Solomon. Oh, say not, wisest of all the kings That have risen on Israel's throne to reign! Say not, as one of your wisest things, That grace is false, and beauty vain. Your harem beauties resign! resign Their lascivious dance, their voluptuous song! To your garden come forth, among things divine, And own you do grace and beauty wrong. Is beauty vain because it will fade? Then are earth's green robe and heaven's light vain; For this shall be lost in evening's shade, And that in winter's sleety rain. But earth's green mantle, prank'd with flowers, Is the couch where life with joy reposes; And heaven gives down, with its light and showers, To regale them, fruits; to deck them, roses. And while opening flowers in such beauty spread, And ripening fruits so gracefully swing, Say not, O king, as you just now said, That beauty or grace is a worthless thing. This willow's limbs, as they bend in the breeze, The dimpled face of the pool to kiss; Who, that has eyes and a heart, but sees That there is beauty and grace in this! And do not these boughs all whisper of Him, Whose smile is the light that in green arrays them; Who sitteth, in peace, on the wave they skim, And whose breath is the gentle wind that sways them? And are not the beauty and grace of youth, Like those of this willow, the work of love? Do they not come, like the voice of truth, That is heard all around us here from above? Then say not, wisest of all the kings That have risen on Israel's throne to reign! Say not, as one of your wisest things, That grace is false, and beauty vain. HENRY PICKERING TO A BEAUTIFUL LAKE. Rapt in a vision of the barbarous past, I saw upon thy marge a wild-eyed race, And, startled, heard the yell That echoed round thy shores! And now, enchanted with the picture fair, Which Fancy holds to view, I fain would blend The murmur of thy waves, And warblings of my lute. Translucent flood! within thy ever pure And stainless breast, the heavens with wonder view As beautiful a heaven, As tranquil and serene: The while, a new creation spreads around— Hills piled on hills, seem laughing in thy wave, And groves, inverted, nod To like majestic groves. And what if o'er thy brink no frowning cliffs Impend—no cloud-tipt mountains, as with wall Insuperable, fence Thee from the northern blast,— Yet dost thou scornful mock its utmost force, And ruffian winter's rudest breath defy; Fiercely he sweeps along, But may not chain thy wave. Seneca Lake is not known to freeze. And still exulting with the dancing spring, Thou seest new beauties deck thy soft domain; And when from summer's gaze The earth dejected shrinks, Thou spread'st thy dazzling bosom to the sun: While pleased, anon, with Autumn's rainbow hues And mournful shell, thou bidd'st Thy waves wild music make. In that glad moment, when the star of morn Leads up the effulgent day, and liquid pearls Are on the flowers, and thou In snowy mist art wrapp'd,— How have I stood, delighted, to behold The sun, like a young deity look forth, And, with a glance, thy face At once again unveil! And when the golden curtains of the west Are gathering round his couch, and his last ray Descending, seems to melt In thy unruffled flood,— How have I rivetted my eye on thee, And wish'd that on my breast a heavenly gleam Might fall, and thus within My soul as softly sink! Yet if there be a more propitious hour, 'T is when the moon from out the silvery east In chasten'd splendor beams,— And sheds o'er thee, and o'er The tranquil earth, her mild and holy light: A shadowy grandeur then invests the scene, While through the willing mind A pleasing sadness steals. O fond remembrance!—but what boots it now To sing of absent charms? Thou calmly sleep'st Beneath thy circling hills, While I am tempest-tost! Yet brighter eyes, and innocent as bright, Shall long upon thy varied beauties gaze, And young glad beings too Delight in thee to lave: And science, haply, on thy banks shall rear Her proudest domes; and, emulous of fame, Bards, yet unborn, shall chant In lofty verse thy praise. DAPHNE. “Elle etoit de ce monde ou les plus belles choses Ont le pire destin; Et, rose, elle a vecu ce que vivent les roses, L'espace d'un matin.” Malherbe. The winds are hush'd; but the chill air of night Pervades my shivering frame. The crisped leaves Which lately waved in undulations soft, To every genial breeze, and look'd so green,— But now were wasted from the neighboring wood, And cumber all my solitary paths. Softly I tread the mazy labyrinth, lest The rustling noise should interrupt the deep And fearful stillness round. 'T is thus amid The forest wilds, when Autumn crowns, as now, The plenteous year, and the gay antler'd herds Look sleek, the unwearied hunter threads his way, And with a step, cautious as Guilt, pursues The timid chase. But what shall I alarm In these deserted haunts, where none of choice Repair, save those whom wretchedness has taught, After long toil, to seek for refuge here? The mole has burrow'd deep, and heeds me not; The bat has ta'en his headlong flight in search Of gentler skies, or nestles in some lone And cover'd nook; while at my feet sleep those, Whom not the crash of worlds shall wake again! Hah! is it so? and wilt not thou awake, My dear, lamented Daphne? Shall that form, That form so heavenly fair, ne'er bloom again? Thy dust, alas! is not commingled here With kindred dust; but doth it aught avail? Lo! where repose the long forgotten race, The lengthen'd line of thy progenitors: Whilst thou, o'ercanopied by balmier heavens, Beneath the tamarind and the orange tree Fit resting place hast found! No winter there Shivers the glories of the circling year, Nor tarnishes the lustre of the groves: Thy favorite myrtle there can never die— There every gale wafts perfumes o'er thy grave! Ah why, 'mid scenes thus fair, should man decay? With lavish bounty nature there adorns The wild, and bids the flowers perpetual bloom, And yet to him a longer date denies,— Nay, warns him thence before his custom'd time. And such, my Daphne, was thy hapless lot! And worse—for thou wast fated twice to die— And twice in the full vernal bloom of youth— The cup at parting bitterer than Death's! How wast thou torn, all lovely as thou wast, And beauteous too as Maia's self when flush'd By genial beams of the young sun, from arms Unwilling to be loosed from thine! How flow'd Thy tears, when every tenderer tie which bound Thee here, was sunder'd! And how throbb'd thy heart When, in a last embrace, 'twas press'd to mine! But years since that sad parting have gone by, And years have flown since thou wast rapt to heaven! Yet how can I forget or thou forgive? True thou didst oft invite me to thy home, Didst beckon me amid thy fragrant groves To taste of golden fruits, and blissful breathe Thy incensed air,—and, dearer far, enjoy Thy converse sweet:—but, such my wayward mood, I spurn'd the call (though softer not than thine An angel's voice) or thought, as worldlings do, At fitting hour to come. Thus wisdom's fool'd, And thus was I infatuated too. My Daphne! art thou then for ever fled? O once again appear as thou wast wont! Thou smilest in my dreams; and when I wake, I pay thee with my late repentant tears: Tears are thy due—ah, doubly due from one On whom thy infant eyes beam'd only love— Whom thou remember'dst to thy latest breath! FLOWERS. “La vue d'une fleur caresse mon imagination et flatte mes sens a un point inexprimable: elle reveille avec volupte le sentiment de mon existence.” Mad. Roland. The impatient morn, With gladness on his wings, calls forth “Arise! To trace the hills, the vales, where thousand dyes The ground adorn, While the dew sparkles yet within the violet's eyes:” And when the day In golden slumber sinks, with accent sweet Mild evening comes to lure the willing feet With her to stray, Where'er the bashful flowers the observant eye may greet. Near the moist brink Of music-loving streams they ever keep, And often in the lucid fountains peep; Oft, laughing, drink Of the mad torrent's spray, perch'd near the thundering steep: And everywhere Along the plashy marge, and shallow bed Of the still waters, they innumerous spread; Rock'd gently there The beautiful Nymphæa The white-pond lily. pillows its bright head. Within the dell, Within the rocky clefts they love to hide; And hang adventurous on the steep hill-side; Or rugged fell, Where the young eagle waves his wings in youthful pride. In the green sea Of forest leaves, where nature wanton plays, They modest bloom; though through the verdant maze The tulip-tree Its golden chalice oft triumphantly displays: And, of pure white, Embedded 'mid its glossy leaves on high, There the superb Magnolia lures the eye; While, waving light, The locust's myriad tassels scent the ambient sky. But O, ye bowers,— Ye valleys where the spring perpetual reigns, And flowers unnumber'd o'er the purple plains Exuberant showers,— How fancy revels in your lovelier domains! All love the light; And yet what numbers spring within the shade, And blossom where no foot may e'er invade; Till comes a blight,— Comes unaware,—and then incontinent they fade! And thus they bloom, And thus their lives ambrosial breathe away; Thus flourish too the lovely and the gay: And the same doom Youth, beauty, flower, alike consigns to swift decay. I THOUGHT IT SLEPT. [From Recollections of Childhood.] I saw the infant cherub—soft it lay, As it was wont, within its cradle, now Deck'd with sweet smelling flowers. A sight so strange Fill'd my young breast with wonder, and I gazed Upon the babe the more. I thought it slept— And yet its little bosom did not move! I bent me down to look into its eyes, But they were closed: then, softly clasp'd its hand, But mine it would not clasp. What should I do? “Wake, brother, wake!” I then impatient cried, “Open thine eyes, and look on me again!” He would not hear my voice. All pale beside My weeping mother sat, “and gazed and look'd Unutterable things.” Will he not wake? I eager ask'd: She answer'd but with tears. Her eyes on me, at length, with piteous look Were cast—now on the babe once more were fix'd— And now on me: then with convulsive sigh And throbbing heart, she clasp'd me in her arms, And in a tone of anguish faintly said— “My dearest boy! thy brother does not sleep; Alas! he 's dead; he never will awake.” He 's dead! I knew not what it meant, but more To know I sought not. For the words so sad, “He never will awake”—sunk in my soul: I felt a pang unknown before, and tears That angels might have shed, my heart dissolved. From this little tale of unaffected childish sorrow, Mr Agate (an estimable young artist of New York) has produced a very touching picture. It was exhibited during the last season, at the National Academy in that city. TO THE FRINGILLA MELODIA. The song-sparrow. Joy fills the vale, With joy ecstatic quivers every wing, As floats thy note upon the genial gale, Sweet bird of spring! The violet Awakens at thy song, and peers from out Its fragrant nook, as if the season yet Remain'd in doubt— While from the rock The columbine its crimson bell suspends, That careless vibrates, as its slender stalk The zephyr bends. Say! when the blast Of winter swept our whiten'd plains,—what clime, What sunnier realm thou charm'dst,—and how was past Thy joyous time? Did the green isles Detain thee long? or, 'mid the palmy groves Of the bright south, where liberty now smiles, Did'st sing thy loves? O, well I know Why thou art here thus soon, and why the bowers So near the sun have lesser charms than now Our land of flowers: Thou art return'd On a glad errand,—to rebuild thy nest, And fan anew the gentle fire that burn'd Within thy breast. And thy wild strain, Pour'd on the gale, is love's transporting voice— That, calling on the plumy choir again, Bids them rejoice: Nor calls alone T' enjoy, but bids improve the fleeting hour— Bids all that ever heard love's witching tone, Or felt his power. The poet too It soft invokes to touch the trembling wire; Yet ah, how few its sounds shall list, how few His song admire! But thy sweet lay, Thou darling of the spring! no ear disdains; Thy sage instructress, nature, says “Be gay!” And prompts thy strains. O, if I knew Like thee to sing, like thee the heart to fire,— Youth should enchanted throng, and beauty sue To hear my lyre. Oft as the year In gloom is wrapp'd, thy exile I shall mourn— Oft as the spring returns, shall hail sincere Thy glad return. THE WATERFALL. Impetuous Torrent! Nature piled Thy rocks amid the sylvan wild; With flower and shrub their crags she graced, And through them thy dark pathway traced; Then bade thee with resistless force Pursue thy mad, tumultuous course, Plunging from slippery steep to steep Till lost in the profounder deep,— While 'mid the rush of waters round, Eternal thunders shake the ground! Impetuous Torrent! Time, perhaps, For centuries hath mark'd thy lapse; Yet has that ruthless spoiler fear'd To mar the work which nature rear'd. Still in rude grandeur tower thy rocks, Still all restraint thy current mocks, In verdant pride still wave thy trees, Sway'd ever by the varying breeze; And the dark cliffs, where wild flowers cling, And where the bee flies murmuring, In matchless beauty robed still, Aye sets at nought the painter's skill. And here upon thy margent green, The Indian hunter once was seen, Gazing on thee in thoughtful mood, Or bounding swift, as he pursued Panther or deer across the glade, Nor reck'd the coil thy waters made. Child of the Forest! thou art fled, Thy joys, thy pastimes, all are sped; The antler'd herd are far away, The panther is no more thy prey, Nor more the timorous Echo wakes, Startled as when thy war-whoop breaks: And yet in Fancy's view still near, Thou brightly art depicted here. The rock that spurns the rush of waves, Is thy stern soul, that danger braves; Amid the flood's incessant roar Thy dreaded voice I hear once more; And as I mark its maddening strife, I think o'er all thy stormy life: While through the spray that falls in showers Upon the trees, the shrubs, the flowers, That wild, bright heaven, so dear to thee, In yon ethereal brede I see. Impetuous Torrent! other times And other men from distant climes, Have now arrived; and thou despoil'd Of all thy charms, thy proud waves soil'd By busy art, shalt be a theme Fit only for a poet's dream. Yet should the forest shade no more The banks o'er which it waved before, And all thy lovelier features too Vanish for ages from the view,— Still through the mournful waste shalt thou Pursue thy rapturous course as now: And when the race that here bear sway Are in oblivion swept away, Thou shalt resume thy pristine reign— And, deck'd in beauty, once again, Shalt the brown hunter's heart rejoice, And wake the forest with thy voice. DESCRIPTIVE SONNETS. SUNLIGHT ON THE WATER. “There is nothing more beautiful than water. It has always the same pure flow, and the same low music, and is always ready to bear away your thoughts upon its bosom, like the Hindoo's barque of flowers, to an imaginative heaven.” Unwritten Poetry. There is a balmy freshness in the air; And as the sunbeams on its surface gleam It seems as if upon the rippled stream A shower of diamonds fell: or as if there, Fantastic knit in frolic mood, some fair Invisible Spirits in the instant wound On airy tiptoe through the measured round, And left their dazzling foot-prints everywhere. 'T is a glad sight! and many a time I 've stood Upon the fringed banks the streamlets lave, Or perch'd me where some rock o'erhangs the flood, To see the light thus kiss each little wave: Ay! gaze even yet almost with the same joy As when I was a young gay-hearted boy. AUTUMNAL PICTURE: A SKETCH. See how the forest waves! The gnarled oak Even bends—and as the unruly wind sweeps through Its sturdy branches, showers of leaves bestrew The ground, or diverse fly; the crow, just broke From out the warring wood, with ominous croak Wheels heavily through air; the glorious hue Of the bright mantle summer lately threw O'er earth, is gone; and the sere leaves now choke The turbid fountains and complaining brooks; The o'ershadowing pines, alone, through which I rove, Their verdure keep, although it darker looks: And hark! as it comes sighing through the grove, The exhausted gale a Spirit there awakes, That wild and melancholy music wakes. THE RAINBOW AFTER A SUMMER TEMPEST. Symbol of peace! lo, there the ethereal bow! And see, on flagging wing, the storm retreats Far 'mid the depths of space; and with him fleets His lurid train—the while in beauty glow Vale, hill and sky once more. How lustrous now Earth's verdant mantle! and the woods how bright! Where grass, leaf, flower, are sparkling in the light— Prompt ever with the slightest breeze to throw The rain drops to the ground. Within the grove Music awakes; and from each little throat, Silent so long, bursts the wild note of love; The hurried babblings of the rill denote Its infant joy; and rushing swift along, The torrent gives to air, its hoarse and louder song. EVENING SUNLIGHT. How beautifully soft it seems to sleep Upon the lap of the unbreathing vale, And where, unruffled by the gentlest gale, The lake its bosom spreads, and in its deep Clear wave, another world appears to keep, To steal the heart from this! for through the veil Transparent we may see, tree, rock, hill, dale, And sapphire sky, and golden mountain steep, That real seem, though fairer than our own:— Still, picture faint of that pure region drawn By prophet's pen, but not to mortal shown, Where flow rivers of bliss—and vale, and lawn Are strewn with flowers immortal—where, alone, Night never comes, and day is without dawn. HENRY C. KNIGHT THE COUNTRY OVEN. I sing the oven—glowing, fruitful theme. Happy for me, that mad Achilles found, And weak Ulysses erst, a servile bard, That deign'd their puny feats, else lost, to sing. And happy that Æneas, feeble man! Fell into hands of less emprise than mine; Too mean the subject for a bard so high. Not Dante, Ariosto, Tasso, dared Sport their gross minds in such grand element. Nor he, dame nature's master-journeyman, Who nimbly wrought a comic tragedy, As poet woos a muse, one Shakspeare called! Nor Milton, who embattled Devils sung; Nor bold Sir Blackmore, who an Epic built, Quick as can mason rear a chimney stack; Nor later these, Klopstock and Wieland famed, Who sung, this King of Elves, that King of kings; Dared the prolific Oven blaze in song. Expect not now of Furnaces to hear, Where Æolus dilates the liquid glass; Nor where the Hollanders, in nests of tow, With mimic nature, incubate their eggs; For the Domestic Oven claims my powers. Come then, from kilns of flame, and tropic suns, Each salamander Muse, and warm my brain. Need I describe?—Who hath a kitchen seen And not an arched concavity call'd Oven? Grand farinaceous nourisher of life! See hungry gape its broad mouth for its food, And hear the faggots crackling in its jaws, Its palate glowing red with burning breath. Do not approach too near; the ingulphing draught Will drink your respiration ere you list. Glance now the fire-jambs round, and there observe Utensils formed for culinary use. Shovel and tongs, like ancient man and wife, He, with his arms akimbo, she in hoops, There, dangling sausages in chains hang down; As Sciences and Arts, distinct, allied; Or, as in Union bound our sister States. Here, flayed eels, strung pendant by the waist; So swing aloof victims in heathen climes; O Algier hearts! to mock at writhing pain. And, high in smoke-wreaths, ponderous ham to cure; So may each traitor to his country hang! And, thick on nails, the housewife's herbs to dry; Coltsfoot for pipe, and spearmint for a tea. Upon the hearth, the shrill-lunged cricket chirps Her serenade, not waiting to be press'd. And Sue, poking the cinders, smiles to point, As fond associations cross the mind, A gallant, ring, or ticket, fashion'd there. And purring puss, her pied-coat licked sleek, Sits mousing for the crumbs, beside black Jack. He, curious drone, with eyes and teeth of white, And natural curl, who twenty falls hath seen, And cannot yet count four!—nor ever can, Though tasked to learn, until his nose be sharp. 'T is marvel, if he thinks, but when he speaks; Else, to himself, why mutter loud, and strange, And scold, and laugh, as half a score were by? In shape and parts, a seed of Caliban! He now is roasting earth-nuts by the coals, And hissing clams, like martyrs mocking pain; And sizzing apples, air-lanced with a pin; While in the embers hops the parching corn, Crack! crack! disploding with the heat, like bombs. Craunching, he squats, and grins, and gulps his mug, And shows his pompion-shell, with eyes and mouth, And candle fitted, for the tail of kite, To scare the lasses in their evening walk— For, next day, and Thanksgiving-Eve will come. Now turn we to the teeming Oven; while, A skilful midwife, comes the aged dame; Her apron clean, and nice white cap of lawn. With long lean arm, she lifts the griding slice. And inward slides it, drawing slowly out. In semi-globes, and frustums of the cone, Tann'd brown with heat, come, smoking, broad high loaves; And drop-cakes, ranged like cocks round stack of hay: Circles and segments, pies and turn-overs, For children's children, who stand teasing round, Scorching their mouths, and dance like juggler's apes, Wishing the pie more cool, or they less keen. Next, brown and wrinkled, like the good dame's brow, Come russet-coated sweetings, pulp for milk; A luscious dish—would one were brought me now! And kisses, made by Sue for suitor's pun. And when the morrow greets each smiling face, And from the church, where grateful hearts have pour'd, Led by the Man of God, their thanks and prayers, To Him, who fills their granaries with good, They hurry home, snuffing the spicy steams; The pious matron, with full heart draws forth The spare-rib crisp—more savory from the spit! Tall pots of peas and beans—vile, flatulent; And puddings, smoking to the rafter'd walls; And sweet-cup custards, part of the dessert. These all, concreted some, some subtilized, And by the generative heat matured, A goodly birth, the welcome time brings forth. Illustrious Oven! warmest, heartiest friend! Destroy but thee, and where were festive smiles? We, cannibals, might torrify and seethe; Or dry blood-reeking flesh in the cold sun; Or, like the Arab, on his racing horse, Beneath the saddle swelter it for food. And yet, ere thou give us, we must give thee. Thus many an Oven barren is for life. O poverty! how oft thy wishful eye Rests on thine Oven, hungry as thyself! Would I might load each Oven of the poor, With what each palate craves—a fruitless wish! Yet seldom hear we Industry complain; And no one should complain, who hath two eyes, Two hands, and mind and body, sound and free. And such, their powers to worthy ends applied, Be pleased, indulgent Patroness, to feed. F. S. KEY STAR SPANGLED BANNER. O! say, can you see, by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming, Whose broad stripes, and bright stars, through the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watch'd were so gallantly streaming? And the rockets' red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there; O! say, does that Star-spangled Banner yet wave, O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave? On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep, Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes, What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep, As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses? Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam; In full glory reflected, now shines on the stream. 'T is the Star-spangled Banner, O! long may it wave O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave. And where is that band who so vauntingly swore That the havoc of war, and the battle's confusion, A home and a country, should leave us no more! Their blood has wash'd out their foul footsteps' pollution. No refuge could save the hireling and slave, From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave, And the Star-spangled Banner in triumph doth wave, O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave. O! thus be it ever when freemen shall stand, Between their loved home, and the war's desolation, Blest with vict'ry and peace, may the Heaven-rescued land Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation. Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, And this be our motto—“In God is our trust;” And the Star-spangled Banner in triumph shall wave O'er the land of the free, and the home of the brave. KATHARINE A. WARE. THERE IS A VOICE. There is a voice in the western breeze, As it floats o'er spring's young roses! Or sighs among the blossoming trees, Where the spirit of love reposes: It tells of the joys of the pure and young, Ere they wander life's wildering paths among. There is a voice in the summer gale, Which breathes amid regions of bloom! Or murmurs soft, through the dewy vale, In moonlight's tender gloom: It tells of hope, unblighted yet— And of hours, that the soul can ne'er forget! There is a voice in the autumn blast, That wafts the falling leaf, When the glowing scene is fading fast— For the hour of bloom is brief: It tells of Life—its sure decay— And of earthly splendors, that pass away! There is a voice in the wintry storm, For the blasting spirit is there— Breathing o'er every vernal charm, O'er all that was bright and fair; It tells of death, as it moans around, And the lonely hall returns the sound. And there 's a voice—a small, still voice, That comes, when the storm is past— It bids the sufferer's heart rejoice! In the haven of peace at last; It tells of joys, beyond the grave, And of Him who died a world to save! GREECE. Where Art's wide realm in mouldering ruin sleeps, And Science o'er departed glory weeps— Where wreathing ivy shrouds in dark array, The desolating progress of decay— Where time is ranging with remorseless tread, Amid the trophies of the mighty dead, There, Grecia's genius hovers o'er the scene Of ruin'd grandeur—glories that have been— Views the vast wreck of power with kindling eye, And kneels beside the tomb of Poesy. Where fame's proud relics strew her classic ground, In gloomy majesty she glides around, Pausing, with rapt devotion, to survey The prostrate splendors of her early day. Those ancient courts, where erst with wisdom fraught, Her senate listen'd, and her sages taught; Where that bold patriot, firm in virtue's cause, The immortal Solon, thunder'd forth his laws! The temple raised to Theseus' mighty name— The storied arch of Hadrian's deathless fame! Raises her eye to where, with beam divine, Apollo blush'd upon the Delphic shrine— As bow'd that chief, to learn a nation's fate, Who gave his royal life, to save the state. With pride, she seeks Dodona's sacred grove, Where towers the temple of imperial Jove, Frowning, in ruin'd majesty sublime, The proudest wreck that braves the blast of time! Shows the broad Stadium, where the gymnic art, Nerved the young arm, and energized the heart— Gave a bold race of warriors to her field, Whose godlike courage was their only shield! Surveys that grot, where still her olives twine In wild luxuriance o'er its fallen shrine— Where Dian's vestal daughters came to lave Their snowy bosoms in Ionia's wave. All dark and tuneless are those laurel shades, Which once enshrined Castalia's classic maids— For barbarous hands have raised their funeral pyre And hush'd the breathings of their seraph lyre— Save when the light of heaven around it plays, And wakes the hallow'd chant of other days! Oh! then, 'mid storied mounds, and mouldering urns, Once more, the flame of inspiration burns! Here, pilgrim Genius comes to muse around, To wake one strain o'er consecrated ground! From prostrate fanes, and altars of decay, He learns the glory of their former day— And, in the tender blush of twilight gloom, He writes the story of some ruin'd tomb; From dark oblivion snatches many a gem, To glisten in his own fair diadem. Immortal Byron! thou, whose courage plann'd The rescue of that subjugated land— Oh! hadst thou lived to rear thy giant glaive, Thou 'dst bid the Christian cross triumphant wave! Mark'd the pale crescent wave 'mid seas of blood, And stamp'd proud Grecia's freedom in the flood. But, Oh! 't was fate's decree thou should'st expire, Swan-like, amid the breathings of thy lyre— Even in the sacred light of thine own song— As sinks the glorious sun amid the throng Of bright robed clouds, the pageantry of Heaven— Thy last retiring beam to earth was given. Where Scio's isle blushes with Christian gore, And recreant fiends still yell around her shore; Where Missolonghi's bloody plain extends, 'Mid war's red blots, Athena's Queen descends. Mark, where she comes—in all the pomp of wo— Darkling around her sable vestments flow— With throbbing bosom in the tempest bare— Wild, on the breeze, floats her unwreathed hair, Though learning's classic diadem is there. Where fate's dark clouds the face of heaven deform— With steadfast brow—she meets the bursting storm, Turns to Olympus with imploring eye, And claims the ægis of her native sky. Hark! round its base th' eternal thunders roll, And Jove's own lightnings flash from pole to pole— His voice is there! he bids creation save Minerva's “first born,” from a barbarous wave. THE PARTING. She loved him e'en in childhood, with that pure Devotion, which the bosom feels secure In youthful innocence—when first the heart Elects its idol, sacred and apart From other beings:—oh! there is a truth, A beam, that wakes not when the glow of youth Is past,—'t is like the ray that morning throws, Upon the bosom of the blushing rose. She was a creature—such as painters love To draw,—like her who to imperial Jove The nectar'd goblet bore; just such an eye, And such a cheek was hers—its roseate dye Seem'd borrow'd from the morning—her bright hair Like braided gold, wreath'd round a brow as fair As Parian marble—all those curving lines That mark perfection—and which taste defines As beautiful, gave to her youthful form A loveliness, a grace, so thrilling warm That every motion seem'd to speak a soul Whose inborn radiance illumed the whole. He too, was in life's joyous spring; the glow Of sunny health was on his cheek—his brow Was bold and fearless,—his keen eagle eye Was looking forth to scenes of victory; For War had plumed his crest—and nerved his arm— And there was breathing round him, all the charm Of high devotion to his country's weal;— While the bright panoply of gold, and steel, That mail'd his breast—and flash'd upon his brow— Gave proud assurance of the soldier's vow. He dream'd not that he loved her—for in truth He knew the child e'en from her earliest youth. Oft had he look'd upon the young Eloise As a sweet being whom he wish'd to please— To gather roses for, and braid her hair, To guard her with a brother's tender care— But never dream'd of love, for haply he Had fix'd his hopes on higher destiny. With pride he heard his summon to the field: Yet, had his heart its secret thoughts reveal'd, Some shades of sadness had been lingering there, On leaving home, and friends, and scenes so fair He came to bid adieu—'t was a mild night Of softest moonshine—and its dewy light Was on the shrubs, and flowers that bloom'd around— And there was music in the soothing sound Of the bright rill that murmur'd through the glade, And sparkled 'neath the willow's pensile shade, The summer breeze was sighing through its boughs In whispers, soft as youthful lovers' vows. She was reclining in the latticed bower— Musing, as 't were upon the stilly hour. “Dear Eloise!” he said—(the sudden flush Of new-born feeling call'd a crimson blush On her young cheek, that made the life-blood start In thrilling eddies round his conscious heart,) “Dear Eloise—I come to bid adieu— To these fair scenes, to happiness, and you. Hast thou no wish—no blessing, for thy friend? Who, far from thee, and all he loves, shall wend His pilgrimage, through wilderness and toil, Uncheer'd by friendship's voice—or Beauty's smile. He laid his hand upon her seraph head, Press'd a warm kiss upon her brow, and said— “May heaven preserve thee, pure, as angels are— The world is wicked—lovely one—beware! Thou art an orphan—would that title might Protect thy innocence from the fell blight Of those who hover in fair virtue's way, To tempt the steps of guileless youth astray. Would I could guard thee—but my path of life Lies through the ranks of war, 'mid battle's strife— There duty calls me—should I ne'er return, Say—wouldst thou sorrow o'er thy soldier's urn? Yet if some future day I dare to claim The dear bought honors of a hero's name— May Eloisa's fond remembrance prove Her youthful friendship ripen'd into love?” Pure as a vestal's hymn that breathes to heaven! That night, their vows of mutual faith were given. Years have roll'd on—but yet no warrior came With laurell'd brow, his youthful bride to claim— Years have roll'd on—the wintry frosts have shed Their sparkling crystals o'er his lowly bed. Where proud St Lawrence wreathes his crested wave, That youthful hero found an early grave. But though unwept by fond affection's tear— A soldier's honors graced his funeral bier. Years have roll'd on since Nature's loveliest child, Within her garden bower in beauty smiled— Years have roll'd on, and spring with annual bloom Still twines her wreath o'er Eloisa's tomb, While kindred spirits hymn her requiem there, And freight with sweetest sounds the balmy air. SARAH J. HALE. THE FATHER'S CHOICE. In the year 1697, a body of Indians attacked the town of Haverhill, Massachusetts, killed and carried into captivity forty inhabitants. A party of the Indians approached the house of an individual, who was abroad at his labor, but who, on their approach, hastened to the house, sent his children out, and ordered them to fly in a course opposite to that in which danger was approaching. He then mounted his horse, and determined to snatch up the child with which he was unwilling to part, when he should overtake the little flock. When he came up to them, about two hundred yards from his house, he was unable to make a choice, or to leave any one of the number. He therefore determined to take his lot with them, and defend them from their murderers, or die by their side. A body of the Indians pursued, and came up with him; and when at a short distance, fired on him and his little company. He returned the fire, and retreated alternately; still, however, keeping a resolute face to the enemy, and so effectually sheltered his charge, that he finally lodged them all safe in a distant house. Now fly, as flies the rushing wind— Urge, urge thy lagging steed! The savage yell is fierce behind, And life is on thy speed. And from those dear ones make thy choice— The group he wildly eyed, When “father!” burst from every voice, And “child!” his heart replied. There 's one that now can share his toil, And one he meant for fame, And one that wears her mother's smile, And one that bears her name. And one will prattle on his knee, Or slumber on his breast; And one whose joys of infancy, Are still by smiles express'd. They feel no fear while he is near; He'll shield them from the foe: But oh! his ear must thrill to hear Their shriekings, should he go. In vain his quivering lips would speak, No words his thoughts allow; There 's burning tears upon his cheek, Death's marble on his brow. And twice he smote his clenched hand— Then bade his children fly! And turn'd, and even that savage band Cower'd at his wrathful eye. Swift as the lightning wing'd with death, Flash'd forth the quivering flame! Their fiercest warrior bows beneath The father's deadly aim. Not the wild cries, that rend the skies, His heart or purpose move; He saves his children, or he dies The sacrifice of love. Ambition goads the conqueror on, Hate points the murderer's brand— But love and duty, these alone Can nerve the good man's hand. The hero may resign the field, The coward murderer flee; He cannot fear, he will not yield, That strikes, sweet love, for thee. They come, they come—he heeds no cry, Save the soft childlike wail, “O father, save!” “My children, fly!” Were mingled on the gale. And firmer still he drew his breath, And sterner flash'd his eye, As fast he hurls the leaden death, Still shouting, “children fly!” No shadow on his brow appear'd, Nor tremor shook his frame, Save when at intervals he heard Some trembler lisp his name. In vain the foe, those fiends unchain'd, Like famish'd tigers chafe, The sheltering roof is near'd, is gain'd, All, all the dear ones safe! THE VICTOR'S CROWN. A crown for the victor—a crown of light! From a land where the flowers ne'er feel a blight, Was gathered the wreath that around it glows, And he who o'ercometh his treacherous foes, That radiant crown shall gain:— A king went forth on the rebel array That arose where a beautiful hamlet lay— He frown'd—and there 's nought save ashes and blood And blacken'd bones where that hamlet stood, Yet his treacherous foes he hath not slain. A crown for the victor—a crown of light! Encircled with jewels so pure and bright, Night never hath gloom'd where their lustre glows, And he who can conquer his proudest foes, That glorious crown shall gain:— A hero came from the crimson field, And low at his feet the pale captives kneel'd— In his might he had trodden a nation down, But he may not challenge the glorious crown, For his proudest foe he hath not slain. A crown for the victor—a crown of light! Like the morning sun, to the raptured sight From the night of a dungeon raised, it glows: And he who can slay his deadliest foes, That shining crown shall gain:— With searching eye and stealthy tread, The man of wrath sought his enemy's bed— Like festering wounds are the wrongs he hath borne, And he takes the revenge his soul hath sworn, But his deadliest foe he hath not slain. A crown for the victor—a crown of light! To be worn with a robe whose spotless white Makes darkness seem resting on Alpine snows— And he who o'ercometh his mightiest foes That robe and crown shall gain:— With eye upraised—and forehead bare, A pilgrim knelt down in holy prayer— He hath wrestled with self and with passion striven, And to him hath the sword of the Spirit been given— O, crown him, for his foes—his sins are slain! THE LIGHT OF HOME. My boy, thou wilt dream the world is fair, And thy spirit will sigh to roam, And thou must go;—but never when there, Forget the light of home. Though pleasure may smile with a ray more bright, It dazzles to lead astray: Like the meteor's flash 't will deepen the night, When thou treadest the lonely way. But the hearth of home has a constant flame, And pure as vestal fire: 'T will burn, 't will burn, for ever the same, For nature feeds the pyre. The sea of ambition is tempest tost, And thy hopes may vanish like foam; But when sails are shiver'd and rudder lost, Then look to the light of home. And there, like a star through the midnight cloud, Thou shalt see the beacon bright, For never, till shining on thy shroud, Can be quench'd its holy light. The sun of fame 't will gild the name, But the heart ne'er felt its ray; And fashion's smiles, that rich ones claim, Are but beams of a wintry day. And how cold and dim those beams must be, Should life's wretched wanderer come! But my boy, when the world is dark to thee, Then turn to the light of home. THE GIFTS. Lady, I 've climb'd the mountain side, And roam'd the flowery lea, And gather'd the garden's glowing pride, And the rose and lily in soft bands tied, A garland meet for thee. O the wreath is fair—but fairest flowers They fade too easily! And they fold their leaves at evening hours, And they droop and die when the tempest lowers, Then offer not flowers to me. Lady, earth's richest mines I 've sought, And search'd the deep blue sea, Where coral caves are with gems inwrought, And these diamonds pure, and pearls I 've brought, As fitting gifts for thee. O, those are gifts the great demand, They are offer'd on bended knee, With a grudging heart by the servile band, A tribute or bribe to the tyrant's hand, Then offer not pearls to me. Lady, this glittering star to gain, The price of victory, I rush'd upon the battle plain, And traced my path by the heaps of slain— This star I'll pledge to thee. O, titled fame! an airy word, A puff of vanity! Ah, think what crimson streams are pour'd, That man, weak man, may be hail'd a Lord! Then offer not rank to me. Lady, I have a heart as pure As the birthright of the free: And the faith I vow will for aye endure, And my love as flowers to the spring is sure;— This heart I'll give to thee. O, 't is now thy words have power to move! My warm tears speak for me; For on earth below, or in heaven above, The richest gift is the heart of love— And here 's a heart for thee! THE MOTHER TO HER CHILD. One kiss, my boy upon thy cheek, That cheek so young and bright, And once again I'd hear thee speak Thy softly lisp'd “good night.” Then rest, and not a shade of earth Can cloud thy slumbers fair; Dark dreams from worldly cares have birth, And thou hast nought of care. O why might not life's silver tide With thee thus ever smoothly glide! Who gazes on the bloom of May, Nor sighs that all will wither? And yet the blossoms must decay Ere we the fruit may gather; And life's sweet morning buds of joy Like spring-flowers soon depart; And thou must change, yet wear, my boy, Life's freshness in thy heart. Pure feelings, like the flower's perfume, Embalm the memory of its bloom. Man's lot, dominion o'er the earth, Maketh his sinews strong, And that proud lot will lead thee forth All ardent 'mid the throng. Life's onward path is wrapp'd in night, And dangers are its fame; Ambition holds an eagle flight, And spurns at quiet's name, And pleasure's siren songs entice, And flowers conceal the precipice. O! wilt thou wander then, my boy?— Away! ye idle fears,— Why shroud our sun of present joy In clouds of future years? There 's One will watch thee though I sleep Where morning never shone; There 's One thy faltering steps can keep, Wouldst thou His voice were known? Then list amid the world's wide din The still, small voice thy heart within. ENOCH LINCOLN THE VILLAGE. Shallow and deep, by turns, and swift and slow, There I behold the winding Saco flow. In early spring, when showers increase its tides, And melted snows pour down the mountains' sides, I 've seen it raging, boisterous, and deep, O'erflow its banks and through the upland sweep. The farmer's hopes, the lumberer's hard earn'd thrift, Logs, bridges, booms, and boats were all adrift; Trees, fences, fields, whate'er opposed its course, Were torn and scatter'd by the o'erwhelming force. Loosed from the fold to crop the tender feed, The hungry flock were grazing on the mead. Their saving Ararat, a trifling mound, Secured them from the deluge spreading round, Till, taught no more to let the stragglers roam, The careless shepherd bore them to their home. And then, from spouting clouds no longer fed, Our little Nile return'd within its bed. Along its borders, spreading far and wide, The tall, straight pines appear on every side. To these thick woods the hardy laborer goes, And rears his sheltering tent amid the snows, His couch the hemlock's twigs, his household ware, A jug and basket fill'd with simplest fare. Ye, who indulge in indolence and ease, Whom spleen invades and moody vapors seize, To whom each day an age of trouble seems, Whose nights are wakeful or disturb'd by dreams, Observe the happy quiet of his rest, And learn, like him, by labor to be blest. Ye bloated epicures, disease's prey, Who waste in vile excess your lives away, Observe his frugal board, be wise at length, And gain like him, from temperance, health and strength. The frosty boreal blast, the pelting storm, Solstitial suns, or seasons mildly warm, The western breezes, or the southern air, Alike to him, wake not one passing care. With nervous arm he wields the keen-edged axe, And plies anew each day untired attacks, Till by his strokes the forest levell'd round, With prostrate trunks and branches heaps the ground. The oxen, faithful sharers of his toil, Drag to the river's brink the heavy spoil, Thence floated downward to the distant mart, And changed from Nature's form to works of Art. But not alone the lofty pine trees fall, The axe unsparing strikes alike on all. Now a rich treasury of golden grain, Few moons have wax'd and waned since yonder plain, A shady solitude, a drear retreat, Had scarcely known the print of human feet. When, joining hand in hand, what charms imparts The potent touch of Labor and the Arts. Planted by them, the sweetly scented rose, On dreary wilds, in blooming beauty grows; The fields, where famine reign'd or wild beasts ranged, By them to peopled villages are changed. Their aid invoked, with no retarding fears, His cumber'd land the sturdy yeoman clears. Fell'd by his strokes, the forest prostrate lies; Its vital sap the glowing summer dries, And last the bonfires burn, the boughs consume, And spreading flames the hemisphere illume. The fresh'ning breezes fan the growing blaze, Bear the light sparks, and cloudy columns raise, And whirl the storm of rushing fire along O'er lighted hills, and crackling vales among. Swift fly the birds, as spreads the ruin round, The frighted reptiles hide within the ground, And all the forest tribes grow wilder at the sound. But see yon simple hut, of structure rude, Of unplaned boards contrived and logs unhew'd: The threat'ning fires pursue their blasting way, And the low fabric falls their certain prey. Alas! 't was Poverty's last hope,—the place Where dwelt Contentment with her sister, Peace. Ah! Charity, thou comforter of wo, Wipe now the tears from Misery's eye that flow: Thou Angel Almoner of pitying heaven, Now let thy treasures of relief be given, Take to thy bosom the poor child of need, The houseless shelter, and the hungry feed: By blessings wing'd their prayer shall make its way To heaven's high Chancery; there will God repay. More sacred than the Thunderer's chosen oak, Let not the maple feel the woodman's stroke. Fair maple! honors purer far are thine Than Venus' myrtle yields, or Bacchus' vine; Minerva's olive, consecrated tree, Deserves not half the homage due to thee. The queen of trees, thou proudly tower'st on high, Yet wave thy limbs in graceful pliancy. On yonder river's bank, around thy root, The closely interweaving fibres shoot, And numerous branches spreading far and wide, Swiftly the wind, strongly must rush the tide To overthrow thy deep and stately strength, And on the strand to measure out thy length. From every twig of thee, as blows the breeze, Fly the ripe germes, the little embryo trees, And form'd with each a wing by Nature's care, Float lightly, quivering in the passing air, Or, dropping, fall upon the stream and flow With rich alluvion, and to forests grow. Fair maple! let thy leaves my brows surround, And laurel wreaths I trample on the ground. The suffering Negro in West Indian Isles, Soothed at thy name, amid his sorrow smiles, Hope's cheering rays dispel his gloomy care, And tinge with dawning light his deep despair. Do not our soil and frosty clime insure Sweets as salubrious, exquisite and pure, As those which burning suns, or humid air With swarming insects fill'd, and slaves prepare? They do! our blest New England's fruitful soil Requires no culture by a servile toil; No master's torturing lash offends the ear, No slave is now nor ever shall be here. Whene'er he steps upon our sacred fields, Their guardian Genius an asylum yields, His chains drop from him, and on Reason's plan, He claims the gift of God, the rights of man. Enough of mountains, rocks, and woods, and streams; We turn our view to more instructive themes: The varied landscape let us cease to scan, And strive to sketch the qualities of man, Whilst from the camera of the faithful brain, We paint the little village of the plain. Let others trace a more extensive view, And different scenes with higher aim pursue: Let them become familiar with the great, And ope the hidden mysteries of state, Or march with conquering armies and rehearse The deeds of heroes in the epic verse: My lowly subjects humbler strains invite, And check the Fancy's more aspiring flight: Yet, though the numerous hamlets rise around, And many tempting charms in each abound, She will not stray from this her little sphere; The brief epitome of all is here. With admiration fill'd, by beauty fired, By virtue awed, by all her charms inspired, With sacred tenderness and watchful care, First should I pay my homage to the fair. Satire avaunt! throw down thy poison'd darts, Forbear to fix thy wounds in female hearts, Forbear to draw from Beauty's eye the tear, A scornful jest to barb, or point a sneer. True, some are mark'd by follies, subjects fit For jeers and taunts, for laughter and for wit. A jilt may cheat you, a coquette may vex, A Messalina may disgrace her sex, A Clytemnestra may her husband kill, A father's blood a furious Tullia spill, A cruel Mary light the Smithfield fire, And numerous victims in the flames expire; But is the starry firmament less bright, Or would you veil the blaze of solar light, Because a transient cloud obscures the one, Or now and then a spot comes o'er the sun? Exceptions to their sex those monsters call, And for their faults and crimes condemn not all. For one of those a thousand you may find Of charming person and of cultured mind. Behold the politic, the good Queen Bess By virtuous rule a happy nation bless, A Joan of Arc invading armies brave, And fall herself a tottering realm to save. See the Czarina, as her father great, In all the arts and policy of State, The heroine Roland tyrant power defy, The patriot Corday for her country die, With learning fraught, Dacier's scholastic page, By female genius signalize an age, And, in our native land, a Warren's name Rank near a Gibbon's on the roll of Fame, And Adams, rich in history's various lore, The arduous path of literature explore; With Shakspeare, great blasphemer of the fair, “Woman thy name is Frailty,” then declare, The “semper varium” of the bard relate Who sang the lovely Dido's hapless fate, And let the strains of satire all be sung, From bitter Juvenal down to pungent Young; Those female worthies still shall live in fame, And honor's haloes circle every name; Still shall the virtues of a countless crowd Proclaim the bards malicious, false and proud. The foul injustice of their pens to show, Proofs, living proofs, full many here I know. And now forgive, ye fair, if, bold and rude, The muse unbidden on your homes intrude; 'T is not to drag you to the common gaze, For modest merit shinks from public praise; 'T is not, with flattery's sycophantic guile, To smooth a frowning brow or win a smile; But 't is to pay the homage which is due, To Truth, to Beauty, Innocence and you. Some could I name, who never fail to please By manners joining dignity and ease; Strictly correct in everything they say, In Virtue's balance every act they weigh, And while to all the social duties true, Good their delight and heaven their hopeful view. Even watching envy not a fault can find, But owns them pure of heart and rich in mind: Censure is dumb, while families and friends Revere those virtues, which the world commends. Thrice happy he, by Fortune highly bless'd, By such, as husband loved, or child caress'd, And whom the ties of marriage, or of blood, Have made the guardian angels of his good. Ye men of pleasure, roving, wild, and gay, Can lawless riot these pure joys repay? Say which, through life's great voyage, will rather please, Love's furious whirlwind or its gentle breeze? Say, when enjoyments have the senses pall'd, And unimpassion'd Reason is recall'd To hold again her abdicated throne, Do you not feel abandon'd and alone? When on your spirits moody sorrow weighs, When on your health destructive sickness preys, When on your rights invade malignant foes, Assail your fame, and stab at your repose, Surely no greater good by pitying heaven Can, in its vast beneficence, be given, Than one, the friend in all the scenes of life, The kind companion, and the loving wife. Yet truth must own such paragons are rare, And few so good, so lovely, and so fair. Though frequent quarries may the earth unfold, Yet rare are diamonds or the mines of gold: So we perceive the mass of human kind, Though fair in spots, is rough and unrefined. Those bless'd with beauty and by virtue loved, Of manners polish'd and of taste improved, Are precious gems, 'midst barren mountains found, Where dreary wastes and frowning cliffs abound. 'T is happily contrived that man is made With tastes and powers of every varying shade. Hence every one the other's wants subserves, And each her own peculiar praise deserves, As well the housewife 'neath the humble roof, Plying the wheel and laboring warp and woof, As the gay charmer, mistress of the heart, Who plays in higher life a brighter part. But she above all competition towers Who adds to other gifts high mental powers. But man, wild, active, versatile, and bold, What pen his various nature can unfold, Depict his actions, character, and mien, And dramatize the vast and changeful scene! Behold him here, the Village for his stage, The scenery Nature, and the plot the Age, Life's tragi-comic subject for the Play, And Actors of all stamps, from grave to gay, From bustling, strutting, pompous, loud, and vain, To simple merit's large and lowly train. Think not the moment lost, as these we scan, For the best “study of mankind is man.” First comes the lawyer; 't is an honor'd name, A title glorious on the roll of Fame, Too dear for wealth, which birth cannot bestow, Or flattery wreathe around a lordling's brow; A title from the fane of Science borne, By weary vigils earn'd, by wisdom worn, Of import vast, in which the honors blend Of honor's champion and of freedom's friend; Yet Justice fails the sacred name to save From profanation of the fool and knave, Who, jackdaws still, the peacock's pomp assume, And strut in pride with half a pilfer'd plume. Prompt with demurrers, skilful in abatements, To circumvention train'd, and bold in statements, Each villain's hireling, used by every knave, Of meanest wretches even a meaner slave, To rob too cowardly, too proud to steal, The pettifogger preys on public weal, And makes some Justice, a commission'd fool, For paltry aims a secret legal tool, Or deeper cheats, to gain him larger fees, Performs by quibbles, sophistry and pleas. As princes, heedless whether wrong or right, Their forces sell in foreign wars to fight; So he, for fees or popular applause, Fits out his arguments for any cause, Like hireling Hessians still enlists for pay, Nor cares who falls or conquers in the fray. Does Law's plain letter stare him in the face; Its spirit then must take the letter's place; But if the spirit shall oppose his aim, The letter then must perfect reverence claim. His declaration do clear proofs deny, Does Reason give his sophistry the lie; Then Reason's false and not to be believed, And every witness perjured or deceived. If, notwithstanding his absurd harangues, Neglect attends him or dark want o'erhangs, Fictitious indorsees his costs may swell, Or clients under par their notes may sell! Or if by clients, whom his frauds have warn'd, Avoided, fear'd, despised, abhorr'd, and scorn'd, Yet may his malice rob some wealthy foe, Whilst perjury aids to lay the victim low. If vengeance urge or avarice allure, No virtue's safe and no estate secure. O'er your whole life the never-sleeping spy, Whilst memory notes, directs his piercing eye, And if, perchance, with careless feet you stray From law's oft doubtful and much winding way, At once the villain, dead to honest shame, Urges his bloodhounds on your wealth and fame, Turns pimp to catchpolls, and would take with joy From off a hangman's hands his vile employ. When bless'd with soul and gifted with a mind, And such there are, we honest lawyers find, Those whose high office is to guard the laws, And vindicate from wrong the righteous cause, We yield the meed of merited applause: Yes more, even those whom headstrong passions urge, To tempt of daring vice the utmost verge, Who, great in crimes, in their eccentric course, Superior art display or mightier force, If Genius beam its animating fire, We cannot help to pity and admire; But when thick skull d, dispassionate, and mean, A creeping villain or dull rogue is seen, If not from sense of justice quite exempt, We load the wretch with hatred and contempt. A lawyer he! O no; he sinks the name To lowest depths of infamy and shame. Much more the humble appellation fits Of petty scribe of low, vexations writs, Whom ne'er a single ray of fancy warms To cheer the gloom of precedents and forms, Extortion's drudge, a mere machine, which Jews, In works too vile for them, may freely use. Provoked by insults or some trifling wrong, To vengeance urged law's mazy path along, The fretful litigant resolves to fit Th' offending neighbor with a “special writ.” Varus, a lawyer skill'd in legal arts, Of high repute for management and parts, Of boldest courage to maintain a lie, In reasoning subtle, in evasion sly, To feeling dead, in principle a knave, Forever craving as the insatiate grave, And now mayhap by hunger urged to seize On any job which gives a chance for fees, His client's burning fury feeds with oil, Urges the suit and lights him to the spoil. 'Squire Quirk, the Justice, to dispense the laws Sits in the pride of power to judge the cause, Grave as an owl in solemn state presides, And as sly Varus bids, the cause decides: Vain all authorities, and justice vain, Not Dexter's self a single point could gain: Cold as the snows which freeze around the pole, No eloquence could warm his frigid soul; Dark as the shades of Milton's Stygian night, His mind admits no glimmering ray of light; Too dull for reasoning and too proud for shame, No power can move him from his steadfast aim. Resolved, in folly's and in knavery's spite, In other courts to vindicate his right, The aggrieved defendant, now on fortune's wheel, Still by reviews, new trial, and appeal, Through every change of law is whirl'd around, And whirls and changes still, but gains no ground. At last his wealth, by fritters worn away, By lawyers' fees and witnesses in pay, Through long delays although he wins his cause, He falls beneath the bulwark of the laws; Yet blame not them, themselves most wise and pure, But those who use them to oppress the poor: They 're speculators, usurers, and knaves, And those who condescend to be their slaves, On whom should rest th' accumulated weight Of private anger and of public hate. Yet O! beware of Party Spirit's rage, The course of direst ills to every age, The lowering cloud o'er freedom's brilliant star, Heavy with ruin, black with civil war. As where in deserts of Arabian lands Some gushing spring spouts up amidst the sands, Its dewy freshness feeds the towering palms, And clothes the spot with all of Nature's charms: But when the hot Sirocco rushes by, The withering beauties catch the blast and die: So, 'midst a world of tyranny and dread, Where blooming Freedom droops its flowery head, In this blest land, its blushing honors blow, And ripening fruits in rich luxuriance grow; But Party Spirit's pestilential power Wilts the fair growth and blights the charming flower, While factious feuds and unforgiving hate Waste half the civil honors of our state. The Ins and Outs a constant warfare wage, With all the malice of vindictive rage, With all the ardor avarice inspires, And all ambition's stimulating fires. To either side unnumber'd followers throng, Some right in motive, most in action wrong, Assailants fierce, accoutred cap a pie, In pride's and prejudice's panoply. With loud declaiming demagogues at head, Or now and then, perchance, by statesmen led, Resolved, though conquer'd, still to scorn to yield, They take with clash of arguments the field: Truth tilts with Error and she hurls amain Her forceful weapons, but she hurls in vain; On Folly's mail they fall with thundering sound, And blunted fall unhonor'd by a wound. Some meanly selfish, a more venal crew, With nought but power or riches in their view, While frowning virtue interdicts in vain, Use basest means the favorite end to gain. At patriot merit slander's shafts they aim, With vacant heads and noisy tongues declaim, Decry the statesman, puff the stupid knave, Support the traitor, stigmatize the brave, Call wisdom folly, honor's self defame, Discolor truth and everything misname. And why? Forsooth a rival to disgrace, To win a salary or to steal a place. Aloof, the Patriot eyes the scene below, With calm contempt or with indignant glow. His wide philanthropy spreads unconfined, Beyond a Party's bounds to all mankind; His liberal mind a general system frames, And in that system knows no private aims, No views to self, no patronage of friends, No mean contrivances for paltry ends. No factious tumults move his steadfast soul, No lures entice him, and no threats control; Through changing times, 'midst all the scenes of State, As stern as Justice, and as fix'd as Fate, He stands sublime and nobly stems the storm Of Folly's rage and popular alarm, Till, all his greatness by the world confess'd, Fear'd by the vicious, by the good caress'd, He meets at last the meed he spurn'd to claim, The unsought prize of office and of same; Yet office adds to him no higher grace, 'T is he reflects his brightness on his place. Diffusive blessings widely swell around, And public weal with party spoils is crown'd. Ye virtuous yeomen, guardians of the land, Be yours the heart, the ever ready hand, Such worth to aid, such wisdom to select, Such truth to shield, such honor to protect. What though no gay armorials declare Of titled knaves that he's the legal heir? His rank is first by Heraldry of heaven, To whom the powers of intellect are given. What though no pomp his humble state allows? He 's truly rich whom virtue's wealth endows: Placed on the level where your fortunes rest, He knows your wants, he feels when you're oppress'd, Enjoys your good, participates your pains, Sinks as you fall, and as you prosper gains. Such, your wise choice, in happy union blend The servant, statesman, patriot, and friend. Your forms of government, by Wisdom given, Have met the approving smile of favoring heaven. Your rightful heir, posterity demands Your sainted sires' entailment at your hands. O guard it with the Vestal's sleepless care, And leave it even more perfect and more fair. JOHN C. M'CALL THE TROUBADOUR. The mists lay dreaming on the mountain's breast, The lazy winds were sinking into rest, And softly breathing as they died away, Sigh'd o'er the splendors of departing day. In awful grandeur 'mid a blaze of light That threw its countless hues, of colors bright, O'er clouds and hills, o'er dells and babbling streams, The sun of even shed his crimson beams. The hollow murmurs of the rushing rill, The mellow horn that sounded 'cross the hill, The nightly anthem of the feather'd host, All golden sounds and sober evening's boast, Mix'd their sweet discords with seraphic skill, And held the wanderer listening at their will. The lowing herds crept slowly 'long the vale, And distant echoes bore the hunter's hail. The curling smoke above the foliage flew, Fantastic wreathing as the zephyrs blew. The merry tabor, and the pipe's shrill sound Made buoyant light the village-maidens' bound, As in the mazy grass they beat the ground. The evening breeze bore fragrance on its wing, O'er all the richest odors scattering. In frowning grandeur, on the distant height, An antique castle lower'd in its might; Its lofty turrets blushing with the hue That now o'er all the scene the red sun threw. Its lord the bold Sir Brian de Valance, The pride and boast of all chivalric France, Here held his court amid Provençal peers, Stranger alike to pity and to fears. 'T was evening's hour, when down the mountain's road, A stranger Minstrel solitary strode. Fatigued he seem'd, and faint—his gait was slow, And oft he stopp'd to listen to the flow Of streams precipitate, that fell with sound Of soothing music on the ear, and found Their devious paths o'er all the rugged ground. Or else he gazed on all the fairy scene Of rocks and hills, and laughing plains between; The towering mounts that in succession grew Up to the clouds, and all their shadows threw On richest vineyards, where the bursting grape Blush'd 'mid the tendrils that its clusters drape; Which, intertwined in light and meshy rings, Like feathers on the bird of Eden's wings. Onward he came, and o'er his back was slung A harp—and from his graceful shoulders hung The garb that poets of the time then wore, While nature's richest, noblest stamp he bore Of light etherous on his open brow, Though something sad was on his features now. His port was such as ladies love to view, Haught and chivalric—yet besides there grew A poet's sadness o'er his speaking face, That paled his front, but stole no single grace. In Bryan's hall the revels were begun, Many a heart had now been lost and won. Blazing with light the rich and festive room, With scorn shut out the coming night's dull gloom. The pride of France and chivalry had met, And winsome pleasure wanton'd without let: The joyous laugh from lip to lip went round, And sense enchanted drank the thrilling sound. The moon held pale dominion o'er the scene, While light and fleecy clouds were oft between Her and the earth in all their beauty seen, Alt'ring their vaporous forms and sailing on, Their magic changes hardly seen ere gone, Veiling the silver graces of that orb, Whose modest charms all other charms absorb. A bugle's call then sounded from the gate. The warder enter'd, and with feudal state, Whisper'd his lord, who cries “throw ope the door, And let us welcome greet the Troubadour, He comes with skilful harp, and soft'ning lay: Ne'er to such guests can courtly knights say nay.” The doors flew open, and with graceful mien, The Minstrel enter'd in his garb of green. In wild luxuriance o'er his front there play'd, Thick, clustering locks that even blacker made The swarthy hue that darken'd in his face, And lent his flashing eye a gloomier grace; While in the lowly bow he made around, More of the knight than peasant there was found. Now ceased the lively dance, and dames drew near The harp's full tone and melody to hear. Then lowly bending o'er the strings he rung A wild and mournful prelude ere he sung. With wilder'd eye the lady Ella stood, Watching the Troubadour as though she would Recall some well-known air, or former tone, Shadow or light that o'er his face had flown. “It is—and yet it cannot be—that air! And yet his brow was wont to be so fair. That voice and I should sure be well acquaint.” The Minstrel watch'd the changes of her thought, And when the warm and well-known glance he caught, Like Egypt's statue kiss'd by golden beams Of mantling morn new-waking from her dreams, A full, harmonious peal of music threw From chords melodious—soft as summer dew. He ceased—and bowing lowly once again, The melting echoes of his wondrous strain, Borne on the bosom of the evening breeze Died 'mid the shadows of the distant trees. Then came a burst of rich and noble praise, The poet's choicest meed for all his lays, From pleasure-beaming eyes and lips where smiles, With wildest sporting, flung around their wiles. O'er one fair face the hue of joy was thrown; With lustrous gladness every feature shone. She look'd her thanks, but trusted not her voice, Content in blissful silence to rejoice. With courteous grace his thanks the Baron made, And turning to his glittering menials, bade Them bear the gold-embossed beaker near, Then pledged his guest and every high-born peer But as he quaff'd the sparkling liqour down, His searching eye was lower'd with a frown; A sudden thought seem'd crossing o'er his mind, And with his falcon-glance he seem'd to find, As every lineament he sternly scann'd, With look so long accustom'd to command, Some well-known feature in the Minstrel's face, Whose dusky forehead gave of change no trace. While through the hall loud peals of rapture rung And pleasure's accents dwelt on every tongue, A happy moment then the Minstrel caught, Whispering, to tell the tidings that he brought. “Oft, my loved Ella, since that hated morn, When fierce—and more—when unrequited scorn, Fell withering from thy father's lip, to blast My fair and knightly fame—but that is past, I will not strike upon a chord that rings No mellow music—but that wildly flings Its piercing discord on the shuddering air. Oft with various guise and subtle care I watched thy casement—under which I sung Some air of kinder days past by, and hung On quivering lights, and gliding forms that past With breathless hope, still praying that at last, Thy form would glad my sight, and once again Thy melting accents chase acutest pain. Alas! you came not—then with desperate hand, I caught the harp of Minstrels of our land; Threw o'er my face the nut-brown olive hue, And from the knight a wandering poet grew, Hoping amid the revels of the time, An entrance for the Trouvere and his rhyme; Then won with melody, like him of old, A prize denied to conquering love of gold.” Here glancing on a stern and martial form Whose features bore the impress of the storm; Like some fierce figure by Salvator drawn, Darkling and towering in his strength of brawn; 'Mid rocks and gloomy woods and savage men Waiting at th' entrance of some banditt's den; The fire's dull embers pouring their red light On stern, wild features, and on armor bright: The brow of Guiscard darken'd, and his eye Threw out a light, as though he would defy, In th' hour of gasping death, the warrior dark, Who took of song and dance but slender mark. While old age lives on mem'ry of the past, Youth feeds on hope delusive to the last; A cheating phantom follows as it flies, Deck'd with gay promise though embalm'd in lies. In rapt and burning syllables he told His lover's tale—while smooth and swiftly roll'd In course untired and same the heedless hour. The morning-moon, half hid amid the bower, In streams of silver light descending, shed Her rays soft melting on the flow'ring bed, That seem'd with dewy fragrance to repay The wand'ring kisses of each smiling ray. The fleeting wind too bore upon its breast The grateful essence—and with odors dress'd, Lavish'd its perfumed riches all around, On dames—knights—marble—and the verdant ground. And now not mark'd, the lovers stood beside A lofty, narrow casement—opening wide Its painted leaves (whose glowing colors told Some tale chivalric, where a Baron bold For love had died—struck by a rival's hand, Who smiled and waved aloft his bloody brand.) Ella look'd up into her lover's face— And round her mouth with melancholy grace, A faint smile languish'd, as she earnest pray'd No fate of theirs should be like that portray'd With cunning skill, upon the polish'd glass. Laughing, her lover bade the boding pass. Yet still the gentle girl in silence sigh'd, O'er her wild fancies brooding, strove to hide Even from her timid self her chilling fear, Her soft eye glistening with the heavy tear. The lady listen'd to his ardent theme Like one entranced in a rapturous dream. “My arms and horse,” then said the youthful knight, Those that must serve me in the morrow's fight, Conceal'd, I left amid the forest's gloom, Hard by the rough-wrought cross and ruin'd tomb. Thou must remember, love, 't was there I first, In fond, but low and broken accents durst Tell thee I loved—amid the awful scene Of towering trees—wild streams and rude rocks green With antique moss—and 'neath that sacred sign, All holy men have ever deem'd divine, Our faith we mutual pledged. Now I retread That path, and at the dwelling of the dead The coming morn must bide.—If in the just Yon haughty Julian and thy Guiscard thrust, Thy lovely image still will brace my arm, Still lend new vigor, and preserve from harm. Then should he fall, thy father may relent And pitying yield his oft withheld consent. At once to shun remark or curious glance, Aside each turn'd, to watch the entangling dance, Where floating lightly through its endless maze Young beauties sought and won th' admiring gaze. From rich-gemm'd ringlets spicy odors flew, From streaming curls of every sunny hue. In Grecian folds the snowy draperies hung, While wreaths of velvet flowers were o'er them strung. Love-darting eyes in melting softness shone, And vermeil lips dropt words of mellowest tone. Their white, impearled arms, thrown light in air, Strew'd rose, and hyacinths, and blossoms rare. The dewy freshness of the leafy showers Rain'd essence o'er the hall, now strewn with flowers. Soft voices sang with air and tone as sweet As those of sea-maids when they haply meet Some blooming boy, who rides the foamy wave, Drinks the rich music, and forgets the grave That yawns—and gazes on the syren's hairs That stream unearthly beautiful, and dares, Of billows' wrath unmindful, still to feed Enrapt upon their smiles—and seems, indeed, To deem it bliss t' obey th' enticing sign, And plunge in awful depths for love divine. His billowy tomb then quickly rears Its foam-topp'd pyramid—and disappears. With fragrant breath the morning now arose, On joy gay smiling, and on keenest woes: The stars, sown o'er the jetty head of night, In brilliance paled before the orb of light; Dark seas of mist roll'd back their murky wave Before the bright, young beams that richly lave, In tints prismatic all his vaporous throne, In glittering splendor, awful and—alone. The cool breeze, rambling, woke the sleeping leaves, With that soft breathing that alternate heaves The yellow harvest and the quiet lake, And balmy freshness showers o'er the brake. Ella arose, and from the casement hung Enchanted, on the quiet scene that flung Its still and fragrant spell on all around. Far up the sloping hills the merry sound Was heard of early shepherd's pipe, and bell Of grazing flocks, re-echoed from the dell. The hours flew onward, and in crowds the dames And low-born serfs and knights of haughty names, Gay in the rich array of gaudy dress, In expectation, to the lists now press. A lovely mead, romantically wild, Stretch'd at the feet of rocks and cliffs uppiled In forms grotesque—inclined its verdant breast, Just swelling from the hills, in quiet rest. The hoary forest cast its sombre shade, In darkling masses thrown athwart the glade; While, here and there, an aged, branching oak The lengthen'd sameness of the green plain broke. De Valance' lofty towers on the left, Of beauty now and chivalry bereft, With splendor glowing of the morning beam, With richest tints of brightest purple gleam. 'T was here the lists enclosed with palisade, Ran far across the smooth and grassy glade. At each extremity was placed a gate, Where heralds—pursuivants—and trumpets wait, And men at arms to guard the portal's way, Watch o'er the order of the gay tournay, Decide the quality of knight, and fame Of those who peril'd in the warlike game. Pavilions, rich with gold and every dye, At measured distance regularly lie; Squires beside them, in grotesque array, Guard the bright war-worn shields that near them lay, Caress the foaming steed that rears from joy, His gold bit champs or bites some martial toy. To rich and lofty seats with velvet spread, The lady guests, with Ella, now were led, Soft eyes shone brightly, and some hearts beat high. From one there came a deep, though smother'd sigh. As queen of love and beauty on that day, Peerless in rank young Ella led the way. She passed like Luna on her azure sea, In beauty sailing—yet reluctantly; Like visions seen by Castaly's pure stream, In the rapt poet's airy, radiant dream. For her the acclaim of rapture bore no charm; To one so gentle it echoed alarm; And on her snowy lid and long eye-lash Black care with laughing pleasure seem'd to clash. Up to her sparkling throne she trembling pass'd, Gazing on knights and plunging steeds—aghast. Pallid she sat, and on the entrance-gate Her deep gaze planted—as if fix'd by fate. As yet, through all the waving plumes in sight, Her anxious eye still sought the nodding white. It came—and trumpets sounding, wildly threw Their warlike clamors all the barriers through. Clarions and cymbals cast their echoes round, Fair women smiled, and chargers paw'd the ground. The Heralds “Largess” cried, while golden showers Fell plenteous o'er their heads, like falling flowers, From hands of gallant peers and lovely dames, Of martial line and far-famed, ancient names. The Marshals too, arm'd cap-a-pie now stand, Prepared at once to judge and to command. With shouts and wild huzzas the lists resound, To this knight first—and then to that redound. Full twenty knights now ranged on either side, Sternly impatient, for the signal bide. Firm in the stirrup—and the spear in rest, Each pants to put his armor to the test, O'er one fierce party dark-brow'd Julian sways, His polish'd armor glistening in the rays. While through the steel-clad ranks he quickly glides, And keenly eyes each warrior as he rides; With careful glance he views each barbed steed, And knight impatient for the warlike deed. In firm array the adverse squadron stands, With rich-dyed streamers, and with well-tried brands. And from the martial column Guiscard brooks With burning ardor all his rival's looks. Unknown, he asks a knightly rank and post, Claims a front station in the armed host. Now blew the loud shrill trump its warrior cry: The breathless audience waited silently; While, circled in a cloud of blacken'd dust, Each party clash'd and mingled in the just. The sounds of clarions and of clanging arms Falling with horrid jar—the wild alarms Of martial outcries and the trampling steed, Fled howling to the mountain from the mead. A mist of darkling dust enwrapt the field; The lance now shatter'd, fell before the shield; Horses and men now roll'd along the plain, Bleeding—struck down—and writhing in their pain. Cries of fierce agony with shouts were heard, Dreadful commingling—as the coursers spurr'd, With hoofs ensanguined tore the fallen knight, Who helpless, shriek'd amidst the furious fight. Gay, streaming plumage drifted on the gale, As leaves autumnal with the loud breeze sail. The piteous cries and groans of those who fell Stole tremulously fearful o'er the dell. Still o'er the scene spectators shouted loud, And kerchiefs waved from out the beauteous crowd. With skill and gallant guise young Guiscard fought, Sternly impatient for his rival sought. Willing they met, and 'mid the horrid din, With fury strove the mastery to win. How fared that maid who madly gazed intent, With eye distended and her fair neck bent? With throbbing heart she gazed and madden'd brain, On bright swords gleaming—and the bloody stain. The pale and panting girl beheld the steel On high bright beam and then beneath it reel, Her lover prostrate—and she saw no more Than that he fell, ensanguined with his gore; A cry in deep, but still half-stifled wo, (Like moan of loud winds baffled as they go. Through dreary caverns speeding or some vault, Angry or frighted at th' unlook'd-for halt,) In plaintive agony she gave, and sunk, A pale and lovely—yet a breathless trunk. Sir Brian saw his beauteous daughter fall, And sternly motion'd for the trumpet-call, That rolls its peaceful clamors all around, And drowns of mimic war the harsher sound. With wildest uproar teem'd the tournay scene, As borne off, lifeless, disappear'd its queen. Whilst squires attending on each suffering Knight, The deep wound stanch'd—unclasp'd the helmet bright; Thirsting and faint the hapless Guiscard lay, Wailing the fortune of th' unhappy day, Till o'er the lists the Baron's rambling eye With anger lighten'd—then fix'd instantly. The fallen Knight he knows, and unquench'd hate With rapid vehemence decides his fate; That wakeful hate that burning, never dies Till in the silent tomb its victim lies; That canc'rous rots the heart where it has sway, And night's dull hue spreads o'er each smiling day. He turn'd with quick decision and command, And scornful pointing with his unsheath'd brand, Bade his arm'd menials to a dungeon bear, And guard with fetters and their studied care, The stubborn fool whose obstinacy led Where meet reward should shower on his head. Full oft the sun had bathed his glorious ray, Crimsoning the waters of the distant bay; Dyed golden masses of the evening's cloud With streaks of blushes, and with purple proud; Dropt on the leaning bark's white-swelling sail Those tints that brighten e'en the canvas pale: And lapt the glowing landscape in rich hues, Whose dazzling's mellow'd by the falling dews. Long months had pass'd since Guiscard hapless lay, Shut from the genial smiling of the day: But now flew on the happy hour, when Young Hope and Love might shed their joys again. With passion's eloquence and conquering gold, Rich in the latter—with the former bold; With tears and melting words, the lady brought That tearful meeting she so fondly sought, Entranced she sunk upon her lover's breast, Content t' enjoy that happy—breathless rest, Till by the trembling jailor roused in fear, Th' escape she plans and dries the fruitful tear. Long-told adieus—and frequent, then were past, More mournful each and tenderer than the last, Till pale with dread, the trembling soldier bore His lingering mistress from the dungeon's door. Noiseless as one of Autumn's stilly days, When sluggish winds ne'er rouse the veiling haze Which wraps in deep'ning mist the distant height, Soft'ning the radiance of too brilliant light, With stealthy pace they trod the vaulted way, (Ne'er seen nor brighten'd by the cheering day,) Nor dream't suspicion's glance, with subtle art, Divined the secret of the maiden's heart. Turn we to that fierce father once again, The storm of passion raging in his brain. With hurried pace he treads the princely hall, While two dark menials summon'd at his call, Their stern lord's mandate in the distance wait. Sudden he turns and checks his rapid gait, Beckons the ruffians to a nearer stand, With haughty air delivers his command. “Ye know the prisoner in the western tower? 'T is well—then ere the coming morning's hour, See that he dies; and when the deed is done, Pluck out his heart—I've use for such a one.” Turning he marshals them their murderous way: Wildly impatient chides the tardy day. The breezy morn sped o'er its orient path, Nor frown'd indignant on th' assassin's wrath: Too well and swiftly done, the bloody deed Nor darks its rising, nor controls its speed; Heaven's pure rays with equal bounty shed Their balmy kiss on Crime and Virtue's head. With smile malignant and with fiendish sneers, The villains' full recital Brian hears; Lists the whole history of his victim's death, The last deep sighing of his fleeting breath: His wild hate gluts with long and gloomy gaze On the dread relic that before him lays: Now bids a servant, with ferocious air, A deep gold goblet to his presence bear. Throws in the bleeding object of his ire; Then as a gift from fond and doting sire, Commands they bear it to his darling child, “Fair as obedient—as sincere as mild.”— O'er that sad daughter's brow the night-breeze flew, Her fever's heat unbated by the dew. The fresh'ning moisture of the morning air Threw no soft coolness on that forehead fair: Each snowy eye-lid swoln and drooping hung, Told of a heart with speechless misery wrung. Her tearless, mournful glance, towards heaven now led, Spoke the dead calm of soul when hope is dead: That cold, undying agony of mind, Too keenly poignant e'er to be defined; That sinks but rarely to its short-lived rest, And waking burns still fiercer in the breast. A young and weeping page now slowly bore That gorgeous beaker, chased with clotted gore, Laid the dread offering at the lady's feet, Trembling essay'd his message to repeat. With sobs and faltering then he told his tale, Deeply intent upon his mistress pale. “My noble lord has sent,” 't was thus it ran, “That which he says will pleasure ye to scan, 'T was kind, he says, such precious gift to send, 'T was what ye prized e'en more than sire or friend. I cannot tell, dear lady, what is meant, But his eye burnt fiercely and his brow was bent, And round his mouth there lurk'd a laughing scorn, That seem'd of fiercest Hatred to be born.” With mien unchanging and with steadfast look, The blood-stain'd goblet hapless Ella took. The page's words now made its meaning plain, All prayer or piteous plaint were now but vain: Despair too, lent a calmness to her tone, Nor fell one tear—nor solitary groan. “My father hath done wisely,” then she said, “In such rich sepulchre should e'er be laid A heart whose feeblest pulse to honor beat, The home of Courage—sacred Virtue's seat! The richest tribute of my thanks then bear That doting parent for his fostering care: This precious gift is all I ever sought, 'T is far too costly e'er to have been bought.” The heavy, scalding tear o'erflowing then, Her slumb'ring maiden-softness woke again. With deep, unsated look of love intense, That fix'd, unwandering gazing of the sense, Her glance now fasten'd on the blood-stain'd urn, While her pale cheek still paler 'gan to turn. From the wild gipsy's casket then she took, With mild and pensive but determined look, A dark thick liquid, and with upturn'd eye, She faintly smiled—and drank it instantly. The deadly poison coursed its lightning way; Death's hue now wandered o'er her, as she lay. The young and faithful page had gazed with air Of love respectful—tender brother's care: But when he saw that ghastly shadow creep O'er his fair mistress' face, he ceased to weep: Swift flew to summon to her couch's side Her weeping maidens ere the lady died. And when they came, they found that goblet prest Closely and tightly on her panting breast. Now all grew silent—and pale Ella's eye, Languid and glassy, sought the azure sky: A gentle motion o'er her lips then ran, As if she pray'd for that dark-hearted man; And then they closed—and with convulsive throe, The spirit fled this scene of earthly wo. On her fair face a holy calm was spread, As if she slept—but not among the dead: Her fallen lid, with blue, meandering vein, Seem'd Parian marble with its wandering stain. Sad wore that day in Brian's gilded halls, And long its memory in those stately walls. The silver tones of revelry had fled, While grief's dull notes were wandering in their stead. The piercing trumpet and the martial drum Slept silent, 'mid the low and deepen'd hum Of sorrowing vassals, on vain grief intent, On mournful duties silently now bent. The hour had come, for that sad requiem said By weeping friendship o'er the festering dead: That harrowing—tearful moment, when the grave Sullenly closes o'er the young and brave; When the dread sound of fast descending mould Strikes on the wounded heart so fearful cold. Many that requiem heard, and told the tale To those who listen'd, e'en when it was stale. 'T was a dark, chilly morn in bleak November, Such as old, gray-bearded men remember: The clouds were heavy—dull—and scattering, Large drops of rain, at times, fell pattering On red and purple leaves that strow'd the ground, While the blast blew with melancholy sound: And falling foliage darken'd all the air, Rich in autumnal dyes, of tints most fair. And ever and anon a lulling note Of sadful music, air-borne, seem'd to float Through all the windings of the brown hued grove, And with the harsher sounds rich sweetness wove. Then the full, solemn hymning for the dead Fell, sullen on the listening ear and spread, While bursting on the sight a moving train Crept slowly onward down the shelving plain. Knights and fair women—holy priests—were seen, In robes—fair flowing plumes—and costliest sheen. Then the sad bier, with dim and black array, In awful slowness pass'd upon its way. Within its dark funereal bosom laid The brave young knight beside the beauteous maid. From those who gazed (a crowd of young and old,) In unaffected grief, the big tears roll'd. Of their sad passion many a tale went round, Told with the low and fearful, smother'd sound. Some said lord Brian, when his daughter died, Wept madly, even in his hour of pride: Raved o'er the lovely relics of that child, In all the tempest of his passions wild. 'T was even lightly whisper'd he had sworn, That the bright helm and glaive should ne'er be born, But that the pilgrim's staff or monkish beads Best fitted one of such foul, bloody deeds. Onward the long procession sadly pass'd, Till to a lonely dell it came at last, Where moody cypress and the clambering vine, In close and loving meshes intertwine. There in one grave lie maid and cavalier, Their cold tomb bathed with many a sad tear: And on its sculpture village damsels hung Fresh flowers, and frequent in the evening sung. Among the rustics too a lay went round, That notes aerial wander'd o'er that ground, On moonless nights, and when the wind was high, And black clouds sailed heavily in the sky. In that lone spot—beside a quiet stream And mouldering ruin, those two lovers dream. EDWIN C. HOLLAND THE PILLAR OF GLORY. Hail to the heroes whose triumphs have brighten'd The darkness which shrouded America's name; Long shall their valor in battle that lighten'd, Live in the brilliant escutcheons of fame: Dark where the torrents flow, And the rude tempests blow, The storm clad spirit of Albion raves; Long shall she mourn the day, When, in the vengeful fray, Liberty walk'd like a god on the waves. The ocean, ye chiefs, (the region of glory, Where fortune has destined Columbia to reign,) Gleams with the halo and lustre of story, That curl round the wave as the scene of her fame: There, on its raging tide, Shall her proud navy ride, The bulwark of freedom, protected by heaven; There shall her haughty foe, Bow to her prowess low, There shall renown to her heroes be given. The Pillar of Glory, the sea that enlightens, Shall last till eternity rocks on its base, The splendor of fame its waters that brightens, Shall light the footsteps of time in his race: Wide o'er the stormy deep, Where the rude surges sweep, Its lustre shall circle the brows of the brave; Honor shall give it light, Triumph shall keep it bright, Long as in battle we meet on the wave. Already the storm of contention has hurl'd From the grasp of Old England the trident of war, The beams of our stars have illumined the world, Unfurl'd our standard beats proud in the air: Wild glares the eagle's eye, Swift as he cuts the sky, Marking the wake where our heroes advance; Compass'd with rays of light, Hovers he o'er the fight; Albion is heartless—and stoops to his glance. RISE COLUMBIA. When Freedom first the triumph sung That crush'd the pomp of Freedom's foes, The harps of heaven responsive rung, As thus the choral numbers rose,— Rise Columbia! brave and free! Thy thunder when in battle hurl'd, Shall rule the billows of the sea, And bid defiance to the world. Supremely blest by fate's decree, Thy hardy tars in battle brave, Shall plume thy wings and keep thee free As is the motion of thy wave. Rise Columbia, &amp;c. The stars that in thy banner shine, Shall rain destruction on thy foes, Yet light the brave of every clime, To kindred friendship and repose. Rise Columbia, &amp;c. The storms that on thy surges rock, Around thy flag shall idly sweep: Proof to the tempest's fiercest shock, Its stripes shall awe the vassal deep. Rise Columbia, &amp;c. Encircled with a flood of light, Thy eagle shall supremely rise, Lead thee to victory in fight, And bear thy glory to the skies. Rise Columbia, &amp;c. DANIEL BRYAN LAFAYETTE. ‘And this,” he exclaims, “is the country whose charms A tyrant's rude fetter would mangle and mar! Where the war-demon howls forth his chilling alarms, And the death-vulture hangs o'er his slaughtering car! Columbia! a pilgrim approaches thy shrine, The offerings he brings are his sword and his blood! O! make him thy champion—his life shall be thine! He seeks this high honor o'er ocean's dark flood.” Lo! the beautiful wood-nymph of freedom appears! Wreaths of blooming magnolia her forehead entwine, Around her an evergreen mantle she wears, And her eyes with effusions of tenderness shine: Majestic and mild, the young Hero she meets, And accepts his devotion with smiles of delight; His heart to her wishes responsively beats, And she points where her votaries sustain the dread fight. Entranced by her blessing and holy embrace, His soul is uplifted on pinions of flame, And, as flies the swift steed in the emulous race, He rushes to battle, to conquest, and fame.— Where danger and carnage bestride the red plain, And death's giant arm, through the dark thundering clouds, Drives his broad lance and piles up his mountains of slain, The whirlwind of conflict our hero enshrouds! Descending through ether on pinions of snow, The angel of peace to our country returns, Stripes the concave of blue with the dyes of her bow, And enshrines here in separate and beautiful urns, The dust of the warriors who fell on our plains— Each nation's apart—yet in nearness arranged— And her olive tree planting to shade the remains— Bids it flourish and bloom there through ages unchanged. She waves her white flag, and two figures advance— The elder 's a matron commanding and proud in her port— But she meets with confusion the maiden's sweet glance, And her cheek seems of varied passions the sport:— Her head wears a crown—but its splendor is dim— For its richest and loveliest jewel is gone! On her arm hangs a banner whose emblem, so grim, And so couchant, was lately the pride of a throne.— But now her bold lion is humbled and lorn— And where laurel and sea-weed once form'd his proud lair, He is stretch'd on a bed that 's dismantled and torn, And his eye is despoil'd of its conquering glare. The younger—though stately—is modest of mien, And we know by her costume and aspect benign, That in her loved presence before we have been, And that she is liberty's guardian divine! ALONZO LEWIS. DEATH SONG. Great Sassacus fled from the eastern shores, Where the sun first shines, and the great sea roars, For the white men came from the world afar, And their fury burnt like the bison star. His sannaps were slain by their thunder's power, And his children fell like the star-eyed flower; His wigwams are burnt by the white man's flame, And the home of his youth has a stranger's name— His ancestor once was our countryman's foe, And the arrow was placed in the new-strung bow, The wild deer ranged through the forest free, While we fought with his tribe by the distant sea. But the foe never came to the Mohawk's tent, With his hair untied, and his bow unbent, And found not the blood of the wild deer shed, And the calumet lit, and the bear-skin bed. But sing ye the Death Song, and kindle the pine, And bid its broad light like his valor to shine; Then raise high his pile by our warriors' heaps, And tell to his tribe that his murderer sleeps. THE MINSTREL'S LOVE. My love is a lady slender and fair, Whose mantle is light as the thin blue air, And falls from her neck as floatingly, As the vapor that rolls o'er a moonlight sea The clustering wreaths of her long thick hair, Curl over her forehead, as dark and fair, As the nightly clouds that heavily flow Over star-loving Sunapee's mount of snow. Like the moon which looks out from a cloudy sky, Is the soul which beams from her large blue eye, Where utterless thoughts appear and flee, Like shadows of clouds o'er a sunny sea. In the sleepless night, and the ceaseless stir Of the busy day, my thought is with her, And memory and love are with sighing repaid, Because of the form of that slender maid. THE WANDERER OF AFRICA. He launch'd his boat where the dark waves flow, Through the desert that never was white with snow When the wind was still, and the sun shone bright, And the stream glow'd red with the morning light. He had sat in the cool of the palm's broad shade And drank of the fountain of Kafnah's glade, When the herb was scorch'd by the sun's hot ray, And the camel failed on his thirsty way. And the dark maids of Sego their mats had spread, And sung all night by the stranger's bed; And his sleep was sweet on that desert sand, For his visions were far in his own loved land. He was weary and faint in a stranger clime, But his soul was at home as in youth's sweet time, And he lay in the shade, by his cot's clear pool, And the breeze which came by was refreshing and cool. And the look of his mother was gentle and sweet, And he heard the loved steps of his sister's light feet, And their voices were soft and expressive and low, Like the distant rain, or the brook's calm flow. And this was the song which the dark maids sung, In the beautiful strains of their own wild tongue; “The stranger came far, and sat under our tree, We will bring him sweet food, for no sister has he.” And the stranger went forth when the night-breeze had died, And launch'd his light bark on the Joliba's tide; And he waved his white kerchief to those dark maids, As he silently enter'd the palmy shades. And the maidens of Sego were sad and lone, And sung their rude song, like the death spirit's moan: “The stranger has gone where the simoom will burn, Alas! for the white man will never return!” NATHANIEL APPLETON HAVEN LINES ON FREDERIC THE GREAT. —“Apres ma mort, quand toutes mes parties Par la corruption sont aneanties, Par un meme destin il ne pensera plus!” Frederic le Grand. Are these the dictates of eternal truth? These the glad news your boasted reason brings? Can these control the restless fire of youth, The craft of statesmen, or the pride of kings? Whence is the throb that swells my rising breast, What lofty hopes my beating heart inspire? Why do I proudly spurn inglorious rest, The pomp of wealth, the tumult of desire? Is it to swell the brazen trump of fame, To bind the laurel round an aching head, To hear for once a people's loud acclaim, Then lie for ever with the nameless dead? Oh no! far nobler hopes my life control, Presenting scenes of splendor, yet to be;— Great God, thy word directs the lofty soul To live for glory, not from man, but thee. THE PURSE OF CHARITY. This little purse, of silver thread And silken cords entwined, Was given, to ease the painful bed, And soothe the anxious mind. The maker's secret bounty flows, To bid the poor rejoice, And many a child of sorrow knows The music of her voice. The little purse her hands have wrought, Should bear her image still; And with her generous feelings fraught, Her liberal plans fulfil. Its glittering thread should never daunt The humble child of wo; But well the asking eye of want Its silver spring should know. While age or youth with misery dwell, To cold neglect consign'd, No useless treasures e'er should swell The purse with silver twined. AUTUMN. I love the dews of night, I love the howling wind; I love to hear the tempest sweep O'er the billows of the deep! For nature's saddest scenes delight The melancholy mind. Autumn! I love thy bower With faded garlands drest: How sweet, alone to linger there, When tempests ride the midnight air! To snatch from mirth a fleeting hour, The sabbath of the breast! Autumn! I love thee well; Though bleak thy breezes blow, I love to see the vapors rise, And clouds roll wildly round the skies, Where from the plain, the mountains swell, And foaming torrents flow. Autumn! thy fading flowers Droop but to bloom again; So man, though doom'd to grief awhile, To hang on fortune's fickle smile, Shall glow in heaven with nobler powers, Nor sigh for peace in vain. JAMES N. BARKER LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD. She was, indeed, a pretty little creature, So meek, so modest: what a pity, madam, That one so young and innocent, should fall A prey to the ravenous wolf. —The wolf, indeed! You 've left the nursery to but little purpose, If you believe a wolf could ever speak, Though, in the time of Æsop, or before. —Was 't not a wolf, then? I have read the story A hundred times; and heard it told: nay, told it Myself, to my younger sisters, when we've shrank Together in the sheets, from very terror, And, with protecting arms, each round the other, E'en sobb'd ourselves to sleep. But I remember, I saw the story acted on the stage, Last winter in the city, I and my school-mates, With our most kind preceptress Mrs Bazely, And so it was a robber, not a wolf That met poor little Riding Hood i' the wood? —Nor wolf nor robber, child: this nursery tale Contains a hidden moral. —Hidden: nay, I'm not so young, but I can spell it out, And thus it is: children, when sent on errands, Must never stop by the way to talk with wolves. —Tut! wolves again: wilt listen to me, child? —Say on, dear grandma. —Thus then, dear my daughter: In this young person, culling idle flowers, You see the peril that attends the maiden Who, in her walk through life, yields to temptation, And quits the onward path to stray aside, Allured by gaudy weeds. —Nay, none but children, Could gather butter-cups and May-weed, mother. But violets, dear violets—methinks I could live ever on a bank of violets, Or die most happy there. —You die, indeed, At your years die! —Then sleep, ma'am, if you please, As you did yesterday in that sweet spot Down by the fountain; where you seated you To read the last new novel—what d'ye call't— The Prairie, was it not? —It was, my love, And there, as I remember, your kind arm Pillow'd my aged head: 't was irksome sure, To your young limbs and spirit. —No, believe me, To keep the insects from disturbing you Was sweet employment, or to fan your cheek When the breeze lull'd. —You're a dear child! —And then, To gaze on such a scene! the grassy bank, So gently sloping to the rivulet, All purple with my own dear violet, And sprinkled o'er with spring flowers of each tint. There was that pale and humble little blossom, Looking so like its namesake Innocence; The fairy-form'd, flesh-hued anemone, With its fair sisters, call'd by country people Fair maids o' the spring. The lowly cinquefoil too, And statelier marigold. The violet sorrel Blushing so rosy red in bashfulness, And her companion of the season, dress'd In varied pink. The partridge ever-green, Hanging its fragrant wax-work on each stem, And studding the green sod with scarlet berries— —Did you see all those flowers? I mark'd them not. —O many more, whose names I have not learn'd. And then to see the light blue butterfly Roaming about, like an enchanted thing, From flower to flower, and the bright honey-bee— And there too was the fountain, overhung With bush and tree, draped by the graceful vine, Where the white blossoms of the dogwood, met The crimson red-bud, and the sweet birds sang Their madrigals; while the fresh springing waters, Just stirring the green fern that bathed within them, Leapt joyful o'er their fairy mound of rock, And fell in music—then pass'd prattling on, Between the flowery banks that bent to kiss them. —I dream'd not of these sights or sounds. —Then just Beyond the brook there lay a narrow strip, Like a rich riband, of enamel'd meadow, Girt by a pretty precipice, whose top Was crown'd with rose-bay. Half-way down there stood Sylph-like, the light fantastic columbine As ready to leap down unto her lover Harlequin Bartsia, in his painted vest Of green and crimson. —Tut! enough, enough, Your madcap fancy runs too riot, girl. We must shut up your books of Botany, And give you graver studies. —Will you shut The book of nature, too?—for it is that I love and study. Do not take me back To the cold, heartless city, with its forms And dull routine; its artificial manners And arbitrary rules; its cheerless pleasures And mirthless masquing. Yet a little longer O let me hold communion here with nature. —Well, well, we'll see. But we neglect our lecture Upon this picture— —Poor Red Riding Hood! We had forgotten her; yet mark, dear madam, How patiently the poor thing waits our leisure. And now the hidden moral. —Thus it is: Mere children read such stories literally, But the more elderly and wise, deduce A moral from the fiction. In a word, The wolf that you must guard against is—LOVE. —I thought love was an infant; “toujours enfant.” —The world and love were young together, child, And innocent—alas! time changes all things. —True, I remember, love is now a man. And, the song says, “a very saucy one”— But how a wolf? —In ravenous appetite, Unpitying and unsparing, passion is oft A beast of prey. As the wolf to the lamb, Is he to innocence. —I shall remember, For now I see the moral. Trust me, madam, Should I e'er meet this wolf-love in my way, Be he a boy or man, I'll take good heed, And hold no converse with him. —You'll do wisely. —Nor e'er in field or forest, plain or pathway, Shall he from me know whither I am going, Or whisper that he'll meet me. —That's my child. —Nor, in my grandam's cottage, nor elsewhere, Will I e'er lift the latch for him myself, Or bid him pull the bobbin. —Well, my dear, You 've learn'd your lesson. —Yet one thing, my mother, Somewhat perplexes me. —Say what, my love, I will explain. —This wolf, the story goes, Deceived poor grandam first, and ate her up: What is the moral here? Have all our grandmas Been first devour'd by love? —Let us go in; The air grows cool—you are a forward chit. GEORGE WASHINGTON DOANE THAT SILENT MOON. That silent moon, that silent moon, Carcering now through cloudless sky, Oh! who shall tell what varied scenes Have pass'd beneath her placid eye, Since first, to light this wayward earth, She walk'd in tranquil beauty forth. How oft has guilt's unhallow'd hand, And superstition's senseless rite, And loud, licentious revelry, Profaned her pure and holy light: Small sympathy is hers, I ween, With sights like these, that virgin queen. But dear to her, in summer eve, By rippling wave, or tufted grove, When hand in hand is purely clasp'd, And heart meets heart in holy love, To smile, in quiet loneliness, And hear each whisper'd vow and bless. Dispersed along the world's wide way, When friends are far, and fond ones rove, How powerful she to wake the thought, And start the tear for those we love! Who watch, with us, at night's pale noon, And gaze upon that silent moon. How powerful, too, to hearts that mourn, The magic of that moonlight sky, To bring again the vanish'd scenes, The happy eves of days gone by; Again to bring, 'mid bursting tears, The loved, the lost of other years. And oft she looks, that silent moon, On lonely eyes that wake to weep, In dungeon dark, or sacred cell, Or couch, whence pain has banish'd sleep: Oh! softly beams that gentle eye, On those who mourn, and those who die. But beam on whomsoe'er she will, And fall where'er her splendor may, There 's pureness in her chasten'd light, There 's comfort in her tranquil ray: What power is hers to soothe the heart— What power, the trembling tear to start! The dewy morn let others love, Or bask them in the noontide ray; There 's not an hour but has its charm, From dawning light to dying day:— But oh! be mine a fairer boon— That silent moon, that silent moon! OH! THAT I HAD WINGS LIKE A DOVE. Who that has mingled in the fray, Or borne the storms of life, Has not desired to flee away From all its sin and strife— Has not desired, to flee away, Like yonder startled dove, And seek, in some far wilderness, A nestling place of love— Where the tumult, if heard, should excite no alarm, And the storm and the tempest sweep by, and without harm. Who that has felt the rankling wound Of disappointment's sting, Or proved the worse than vanity Of every earthly thing, Has not desired, like yon sweet dove, To wander far away, And find some desert lodging place, And there for ever stray— Where the vain show of earth should no longer delude. Where the fiend disappointment should never intrude. Who that has felt the crumbling touch Of premature decay, Or, sorer far, has mourn'd o'er friends, Torn from his heart away, Has not desired, like yonder dove, To seek some lonely nest, And, far from earth's vain fellowship, To dwell and be at rest— Till the summons be heard, that shall bid him depart And for ever rejoin the beloved of his heart. And it shall be—that summons of joy shall be given, To the converse of saints, to the mansions of heaven, Where the cross of the sufferer shall no more be borne, But the crown of the conqueror for ever be worn. Thou, who seek'st this glorious prize, Ask no more for wings of dove; Angel-pinion'd, thou shalt rise, To the realms of peace and love. Realms, where Christ has gone before, Blissful mansions to prepare; Realms, where they who serve Him here, Shall his power and glory share. There, no battle-fray is heard; There, no tempest need be fear'd; Disappointment cannot sting, Banish'd thence each hurtful thing, Sickness comes not there, nor pain, Death hath there no dark domain; Gather'd there, no foot shall rove Of the happy friends we love; Gather'd there, no soul shall roam; 'T is our own—our Father's HOME. LINES, SUGGESTED BY A VERY BRILLIANT SUN-SETTING. Oh! see yon glowing occident, With crimson, gold, and purple blent— How high and wide the pageant's spread, How far its gorgeous glories shed; Not all that the earth has of brightest and best. Can vie with the splendors of yonder west. Oh! could we but mount to that golden clime, And traverse those pathways of purple light, To the perishing things of earth and time, We 'd bid a long, and a glad “good night!” There, 'mid the glow of parting day, Through amaranthine fields we'd stray, Drinking in, with ravish'd ears, The music of the circling spheres; Gazing on glories of brighter shine, Than the richest gems of Golconda's mine; Resting in bowers of sweeter perfume, Than the “gardens of Gul,” in their fairest bloom. Fond enthusiast! see—it fades, Even upon thy charmed sight; Lost 'mid evening's gather'd shades, Dying with the dying light; Thus ever fades earth's loveliest, Thus dies the brightest and the best. I 've seen, in blooming loveliness, The youthful maiden's angel form; I 've seen, in towering stateliness, The hero, breasting battle's storm; The canker-worm of hopelessness Has blighted all her bloom; War's iron bolt, in ruthlessness, Has sped him to the tomb: Thus ever fades earth's loveliest, Thus dies the brightest and the best. Then count not maiden's loveliness, Nor hero's towering stateliness, Mortal, dare be wise: Let not thy soul's aspiring rest On gilded east, or glowing west— Look beyond the skies! There, far above that line of light, Which bounds thy dim and shorten'd sight, In never-dying glories, shine The splendors of the world divine. The new Jerusalem, the holy, Whose foundations are of gold; Garnish'd with the radiant glory, Of thousand precious stones untold; And the rainbow-circled throne, On its fiery axles wheeling; And Jehovah's own Zion, the holy mount; And the water of life, in its crystal fount; And the tree, with its leaves for the nation's healing: Such as these, but numberless, The glories of that heavenly place, Where sorrow is never known, nor night, For God and the Lamb are its joy and light. SPIRIT OF SPRING. Spirit, that from the breathing south, Art wafted hither on dewy wing, By the soften'd light of that sunny eye, And that voice of wild-wood melody, And those golden tresses wantoning, And the perfumed breath of that balmy mouth. We know thee, Spirit of Spring— Spirit of beauty, these thy charms, Spirit of Spring! Spirit of Spring! thou com'st to wake The slumbering energies of earth; The zephyr's breath, to thee we owe, Thine is the streamlet's silver flow, And thine, the gentle flowerets' birth, And their silence, hark! the wild birds break, For thy welcome, Spirit of Spring!— Spirit of life, thy triumphs these, Spirit of Spring! Spirit of Spring! when the cheek is pale, There is health in thy balmy air, And peace in that brow of beaming bright, And joy in that eye of sunny light, And golden hope in that flowing hair: Oh! that such influence e'er should fail, For a moment, Spirit of Spring— Spirit of health, peace, joy and hope, Spirit of Spring! Yet fail it must—for it comes of earth, And it may not shame its place of birth, Where the best can bloom but a single day, And the fairest is first to fade away. But oh! there's a changeless world above, A world of peace, and joy, and love, Where, gather'd from the tomb, The holy hopes that earth has cross'd, And the pious friends that we loved and lost Immortally shall bloom. Who will not watch, and strive, and pray, That his longing soul may soar away, On faith's untiring wing, To join the throng of the saints in light, In that world, for ever fair and bright, Of endless, cloudless Spring! ON A VERY OLD WEDDING RING. The device—two hearts united. The motto—“Dear love of mine, my heart is thine.” I like that ring, that ancient ring Of massive form, and virgin gold As firm, as free from base alloy, As were the sterling hearts of old. I like it—for it wafts me back, Far, far along the stream of time, To other men, and other days, The men and days of deeds sublime. But most I like it as it tells The tale of well-requited love; How youthful fondness persevered And youthful faith disdain'd to rove;— How warmly he his suit preferr'd, Though she, unpitying, long denied, Till, softened and subdued, at last, He won his fair and blooming bride;— How, till the appointed day arrived, They blamed the lazy-footed hours;— How then the white-robed maiden train Strew'd their glad way with freshest flowers;— And how, before the holy man, They stood in all their youthful pride, And spoke those words, and vow'd those vows Which bind the husband to his bride; All this it tells;—the plighted troth, The gift of every earthly thing, The hand in hand, the heart in heart— For this I like that ancient ring. I like its old and quaint device; Two blended hearts—though time may wear them, No mortal change, no mortal chance, “Till death,” shall e'er in sunder tear them. Year after year, 'neath sun and storm, Their hopes in heaven, their trust in God, In changeless, heartfelt, holy love, These two, the world's rough pathways trod. Age might impair their youthful fires, Their strength might fail, 'mid life's bleak weather, Still, hand in hand, they travell'd on,— Kind souls! they slumber now together. I like its simple posy too; “Mine own dear love, this heart is thine!” Thine, when the dark storm howls along, As when the cloudless sunbeams shine. “This heart is thine, mine own dear love!” Thine, and thine only, and for ever; Thine, till the springs of life shall fail— Thine, till the chords of life shall sever Remnant of days departed long, Emblem of plighted troth unbroken, Pledge of devoted faithfulness, Of heartfelt, holy love, the token— What varied feelings round it cling! For these, I like that ancient ring. THE CLOUD BRIDGE: A REMEMBERED VISION. Saw ye that cloud, which arose in the west, As the burning sun sank down to his rest, How it spread so wide, and tower'd so high, O'er the molten gold of that glowing sky, That it seem'd—Oh! it seem'd like some arched way, As it beam'd and gleam'd, in that glorious ray, Where the spirit, freed From its earthly weed, And robed in the white Of the saints in light, Might pass from the waves of sin and wo, To that world where ceaseless pleasures flow! Ye saw that cloud, how it tower'd alone, Like an arched path o'er the billows thrown, How its pillars of azure and purple stood, And mock'd at the dash of the angry flood, While it beam'd—oh! it beam'd from its battlements high, As it gleam'd, and stream'd, in that western sky, Such a flood of mellow and golden light, As chain'd and fix'd the ravish'd sight, And pour'd, along our dark'ning way, The peace and joy of celestial day. Such, as we haste to our heavenly home, Saviour! such be the sights that come— Thus, while the visions of time flit by, And the fashion of earth grows dim to our eye, Thus, let the light—oh! the light of thy love, Beam bright on our sight from the mansions above— Rending the gloom Which enwraps the tomb, And guiding our eye To that world on high, Where the people who love thee, for ever shall share The rest thou hast purchased, and gone to prepare. NATHANIEL H. WRIGHT THE ISLE OF FLOWERS. In Huron's wave a lovely isle Gems the blue water's vast expanse. There nature wears her sweetest smile, And sunbeams o'er her beauties dance. In vain the angry billows beat Against its rock-encircled shore; The spray but makes its blossoms sweet, Expanding 'mid the tempest's roar. But when the winds and waves are hush'd, And evening's shade is stealing on, When the last beams of day have blush'd, And Hesper mounts his cloudless throne How gently weep the dews of night, Which bow the tender harebell's head And, falling noiseless, sweetly light Upon the spotless lily's bed. Oh! were but man like that fair isle, In vain should trouble's tempests gloom; Hope's fairest flowers around should smile, And faith and resignation bloom. When life's last lingering beam should fade, The radiant star of peace would rise, And dews of grace, at evening's shade, His spirit nurture for the skies. THE STAR OF BETHLEHEM. When night her lonely shade has spread Around the wayworn wanderer's head, How welcome is the distant gleam Of cottage taper's twinkling beam, To guide and cheer his devious tread, By marshy fen or mountain stream. Thus in the wilderness of life, When o'er us gloom the shades of strife, When adverse fortune's tempests roll, And beat upon the troubled soul, There beams athwart affliction's night, With rays of peace, a holy light: Oh! 't is that bright and lovely star, Which guides the wanderer from afar; Which smiles upon the brow of even, And holds its course in midway heaven. Mark'st thou the rainbow's beauteous hue In yonder eastern sky of blue? A moment, and the tints shall fade, And all its glories sink in shade. Or dost thou mark yon opening flower? 'T is but the blossom of an hour; Its leaves shall by the winds be strown, And where it bloom'd no more be known. The solid globe shall pass away, The fleeting atom of a day. The sun, and every lesser light, Shall all be quenched in endless night. Yet shall the Star of Bethlehem shine, A light of origin divine: And when the flood of ruin streams, That star shall brighter shed its beams. It shone upon a Saviour's birth, And chased the gathering gloom of earth. No cloud obscures its holy ray, Its torch was lit in realms above, And from the shrine of boundless love It flames with heaven's own lucid day. When is fulfilled Jehovah's grace, When other orbs no more have place, 'T will light th' immensity of space. SOLYMAN BROWN LADY BYRON TO HER HUSBAND. Fare thee well, inconstant lover! If thy fickle flame was love;— Though our transient joys are over, I can ne'er inconstant prove. Man may boast a deathless passion, Swear his love shall ne'er decline; Yet, unfix'd as changing fashion, Woman's fate may change like mine! Once I thought I might believe thee; Might on Byron's oath rely; But my arms do scarce receive thee Ere thy oaths, unheeded, die. From paternal arms you took me, Stole me from a mother's care; Then in wantonness forsook me For a less admiring fair. Prayers and tears were unavailing, Nought thy purpose could beguile; Not a wife, her woes bewailing, Nor a lovely infant's smile. Heaven had form'd thee for unkindness, Steel'd thy soul to all that 's mild; Dimm'd thy moral sight with blindness, Left thee Nature's wayward child. Stay! I must not—cannot chide thee; What thou hast not, who can blame? Virtue is what heaven denied thee, And the world has done the same. Think not I can e'er forget thee; No, thy griefs will all be mine; I shall weep when foes beset thee, Smile when fortune's sun shall shine. Must I—can I—shall a mother Hate the father of her child? Gracious Heaven! my anguish smother,— At that name, my infant smiled! Smiled to think she had a father To protect her growing years;— Unsuspecting orphan, rather Drown thine eye in floods of tears! Father, now, sweet babe, thou hast not; All his care you must forego; Other woes thy peace may blast not, Yet thou hast this keenest wo! Orphan babe! my care shall ever Guard thee from the ills of life; Death alone hath power to sever Byron's babe and constant wife! THE EMIGRANT'S FAREWELL. Farewell to the land that my fathers defended; Farewell to the field which their ashes inurn; The holiest flame on their altars descended, Which, fed by their sons, shall eternally burn: Ah! soft be the bed where the hero reposes; And light be the green turf that over him closes— Gay Flora shall deck, with her earliest roses, The graves of my sires, and the land of my birth. Adieu to the scenes which my heart's young emotions Have drest in attire so alluringly gay; Ah! never, no never, can billowing oceans, Nor time, drive the fond recollections away! From days that are past, present comfort I borrow; The scenes of to-day shall be brighter to-morrow; In age I'll recall, as a balm for my sorrow, The graves of my sires, and the land of my birth. I go to the West, where the forest, receding, Invites the adventurous axe-man along; I go to the groves where the wild deer are feeding, And mountain-birds carol their loveliest song: Adieu to the land that my fathers defended, Adieu to the soil on which freemen contended, Adieu to the sons who from heroes descended, The graves of my sires and the land of my birth. When far from my home and surrounded by strangers, My thoughts shall recall the gay pleasures of youth: Though life's stormy ocean shall threaten with dangers, My soul shall repose in the sunshine of truth: While streams to their own native ocean are tending, And forest oaks, swept by the tempest, are bending, My soul shall exult, as she 's proudly defending The graves of my sires, and the land of my birth. JOSEPH RODMAN DRAKE. THE AMERICAN FLAG. When Freedom from her mountain height, Unfurl'd her standard to the air, She tore the azure robe of night, And set the stars of glory there! She mingled with its gorgeous dyes The milky baldric of the skies, And striped its pure, celestial white With streakings of the morning light; Then from his mansion in the sun, She call'd her eagle bearer down, And gave into his mighty hand The symbol of her chosen land. Majestic monarch of the cloud! Who rear'st aloft thy regal form, To hear the tempest trumping loud, And see the lightning-lances driven, When stride the warriors of the storm, And rolls the thunder-drum of heaven! Child of the sun! to thee 't is given To guard the banner of the free, To hover in the sulphur smoke, To ward away the battle-stroke, And bid its blendings shine afar, Like rainbows on the cloud of war, The harbingers of victory. Flag of the brave! Thy folds shall fly, The sign of hope and triumph high! When speaks the signal trumpet tone, And the long line comes gleaming on, (Ere yet the life-blood, warm and wet, Has dimm'd the glistening bayonet,) Each soldier's eye shall brightly turn, To where thy meteor glories burn, And, as his springing steps advance, Catch war and vengeance from the glance! And when the cannon-mouthings loud, Heave in wild wreaths the battle-shroud, And gory sabres rise and fall, Like shoots of flame on midnight pall,— There shall thy victor glances glow, And cowering foes shall sink beneath Each gallant arm that strikes below That lovely messenger of death! Flag of the seas! on ocean's wave, Thy stars shall glitter o'er the brave, When death, careering on the gale, Sleeps darkly round the bellied sail, And frighted waves rush wildly back Before the broadside's reeling rack,— The dying wanderer of the sea Shall look, at once, to heaven and thee, And smile to see thy splendors fly, In triumph o'er his closing eye. Flag of the free heart's only home! By angel hands to valor given,— Thy stars have lit the welkin dome, And all thy hues were born in heaven! For ever float that standard sheet! Where breathes the foe that stands before us With Freedom's soil beneath our feet, And Freedom's banner streaming o'er us! JAMES ABRAHAM HILLHOUSE HADAD. SCENE III. The garden of Absalom's house on Mount Zion, near the palace, overlooking the city. Tamar sitting by a fountain. Tam. How aromatic evening grows! The flowers, And spicy shrubs exhale like onycha; Spikenard and henna emulate in sweets. Blest hour! which He, who fashioned it so fair, So softly glowing, so contemplative, Hath set, and sanctified to look on man. And lo! the smoke of evening sacrifice Ascends from out the tabernacle. Heaven Accept the expiation, and forgive This day's offences!—Ha! the wonted strain, Precursor of his coming!—Whence can this— It seems to flow from some unearthly hand— Enter Hadad. Had. Does beauteous Tamar view, in this clear fount, Herself, or heaven? Tam. Nay, Hadad, tell me whence Those sad, mysterious sounds. Had. What sounds, dear Princess? Tam. Surely, thou know'st; and now I almost think Some spiritual creature waits on thee. Had. I heard no sounds, but such as evening sends Up from the city to these quiet shades; A blended murmur sweetly harmonizing With flowing fountains, feather'd minstrelsy, And voices from the hills. Tam. The sounds I mean, Floated like mournful music round my head, From unseen fingers. Had. When? Tam. Now, as thou camest. Had. 'T is but thy fancy, wrought To ecstasy; or else thy grandsire's harp Resounding from its tower at eventide. I've lingered to enjoy its solemn tones, Till the broad moon, that rose o'er Olivet, Stood listening in the zenith; yea, have deem'd Viols and heavenly voices answer'd him. Tam. But these— Had. Were we in Syria, I might say The Naiad of the fount, or some sweet Nymph, The goddess of these shades, rejoiced in thee, And gave thee salutations; but I fear Judah would call me infidel to Moses. Tam. How like my fancy! When these strains precede Thy steps, as oft they do, I love to think Some gentle being who delights in us Is hovering near, and warns me of thy coming; But they are dirge-like. Had. Youthful fantasy, Attuned to sadness, makes them seem so, lady. So evening's charming voices, welcomed ever, As signs of rest and peace;—the watchman's call, The closing gates, the Levite's mellow trump Announcing the returning moon, the pipe Of swains, the bleat, the bark, the housing-bell, Send melancholy to a drooping soul. Tam. But how delicious are the pensive dreams That steal upon the fancy at their call! Had. Delicious to behold the world at rest. Meek labor wipes his brow, and intermits The curse, to clasp the younglings of his cot; Herdsmen, and shepherds, fold their flocks—and hark! What merry strains they send from Olivet! The jar of life is still; the city speaks In gentle murmurs; voices chime with lutes Waked in the streets and gardens; loving pairs Eye the red west in one another's arms; And nature, breathing dew and fragrance, yields A glimpse of happiness, which He, who form'd Earth and the stars, had power to make eternal. Tam. Ah! Hadad, mean'st thou to reproach the Friend Who gave so much, because he gave not all? Had. Perfect benevolence, methinks, had will'd Unceasing happiness, and peace, and joy; Fill'd the whole universe of human hearts With pleasure, like a flowing spring of life. Tam. Our Prophet teaches so, till man rebell'd. Had. Mighty rebellion! Had he 'leaguer'd Heaven With beings powerful, numberless, and dreadful, Strong as the enginery that rocks the world When all its pillars tremble; mix'd the fires Of onset with annihilating bolts Defensive volleyed from the throne; this, this Had been rebellion worthy of the name, Worthy of punishment. But what did man? Tasted an apple! and the fragile scene, Eden, and innocence, and human bliss, The nectar-flowing streams, life-giving fruits, Celestial shades, and amaranthine flowers, Vanish; and sorrow, toil, and pain, and death, Cleave to him by an everlasting curse. Tam. Ah! talk not thus. Had. Is this benevolence?— Nay, loveliest, these things sometimes trouble me; For I was tutor'd in a brighter faith. Our Syrians deem each lucid fount, and stream, Forest, and mountain, glade, and bosky dell, Peopled with kind divinities, the friends Of man, a spiritual race allied To him by many sympathies, who seek His happiness, inspire him with gay thoughts, Cool with their waves, and fan him with their airs O'er them, the Spirit of the Universe, Or Soul of Nature, circumfuses all With mild, benevolent, and sun-like radiance; Pervading, warming, vivifying earth, As spirit does the body, till green herbs, And beauteous flowers, and branchy cedars rise; And shooting stellar influence through her caves, Whence minerals and gems imbibe their lustre. Tam. Dreams, Hadad, empty dreams. Had. These Deities They invocate with cheerful gentle rites, Hang garlands on their altars, heap their shrines With Nature's bounties, fruits, and fragrant flowers. Not like yon gory mount that ever reeks— Tam. Cast not reproach upon the holy altar. Had. Nay, sweet.—Having enjoyed all pleasures here That Nature prompts, but chiefly blissful love, At death, the happy Syrian maiden deems Her immaterial flies into the fields, Or circumambient clouds, or crystal brooks, And dwells, a Deity, with those she worshipp'd; Till time, or fate, return her in its course To quaff, once more, the cup of human joy. Tam. But thou believ'st not this. Had. I almost wish Thou didst; for I have fear'd, my gentle Tamar, Thy spirit is too tender for a Law Announced in terrors, coupled with the threats Of an inflexible and dreadful Being, Whose word annihilates, whose awful voice Thunders the doom of nations, who can check The sun in heaven, and shake the loosen'd stars, Like wind-toss'd fruit, to earth, whose fiery step The earthquake follows, whose tempestuous breath Divides the sea, whose anger never dies, Never remits, but everlasting burns, Burns unextinguish'd in the deeps of Hell. Jealous, implacable— Tam. Peace! impious! peace! Had. Ha! says not Moses so? The Lord is jealous. Tam. Jealous of our faith, Our love, our true obedience, justly his; And a poor recompense for all his favors. Implacable he is not; contrite man Ne'er found him so. Had. But others have, If oracles be true. Tam. Little we know Of them; and nothing of their dire offence. Had. I meant not to displease, love; but my soul Sometimes revolts, because I think thy nature Shudders at him and yonder bloody rites. How dreadful! when the world awakes to light, And life, and gladness, and the jocund tide Bounds in the veins of every happy creature, Morning is usher'd by a murder'd victim, Whose wasting members reek upon the air, Polluting the pure firmament; the shades Of evening scent of death; almost, the shrine O'ershadowed by the holy Cherubim; And where the clotted current from the altar Mixes with Kedron, all its waves are gore. Nay, nay, I grieve thee—'t is not for myself, But that I fear these gloomy things oppress Thy soul, and cloud its native sunshine. Tam. (in tears, clasping her hands.) Witness, ye Heavens! Eternal Father, witness! Blest God of Jacob! Maker! Friend! Preserver! That with my heart, my undivided soul, I love, adore, and praise thy glorious name, Confess thee Lord of all, believe thy Laws Wise, just, and merciful, as they are true. O Hadad, Hadad! you misconstrue much The sadness that usurps me—'t is for thee I grieve—for hopes that fade—for your lost soul, And my lost happiness. Had. O say not so, Beloved Princess. Why distrust my faith? Tam. Thou know'st, alas, my weakness; but remember, I never, never will be thine, although The feast, the blessing, and the song were past, Though Absalom and David call'd me bride, Till sure thou own'st, with truth, and love sincere, The Lord Jehovah. Had. Leave me not—Hear, hear— I do believe—I know that Being lives Whom you adore. Ah! stay—by proofs I know Which Moses had not. Tam. Prince, unclasp my hand. (Exit.) Had. Untwine thy fetters if thou canst.—How sweet To watch the struggling softness! It allays The beating tempest of my thoughts, and flows Like the nepenthe of elysium through me. How exquisite! Like subtlest essences, She fills the spirit! How the girdle clips Her taper waist with its resplendent clasp! Her bosom's silvery-swelling network yields Ravishing glimpses, like sweet shade and moonshine Checkering Astarte's statue. AN APOLOGUE. In early days, when Fancy sheds Illusive colors round our heads, Her prism before my wondering eyes Display'd the world in rainbow dyes, Fruits like the emerald clusters found In Arab tales, beneath the ground, Woo'd me to pluck from every tree, As, ere the dew-drops left the lea, I climb'd the Hill of Hope that stood Fast by my native solitude. How fair a prospect met me here! Of woods, and plains, and rivers clear— Of neighbor mountains dark and high, That mix'd, receding, with the sky; Fields with the waving treasure stored, Whence rustic plenty decks her board; Valleys within whose sheltering breast The sons of labor take their rest;— But fairer far than aught in view Beneath the cloudless cope of blue, More tempting bright, appear'd to me The smooth expanse of burnish'd sea; The sea of life, where thousand sails Spread their white bosoms to the gales. How blest, methought, along that tide Of waveless beauty still to glide, Or 'mid those sea-green isles to stray Where purer sunbeams seem to play! Where, as the tales of Poets tell, The lovely maids of ocean dwell! What rapture, could I steal so near As once their magic shells to hear! Or on some coral rock behold Them sit, and braid their locks of gold! Others have wish'd, and wish'd in vain, What I, more happy, may attain. Impatient o'er life's sea to roam, I lightly bade adieu to home. Pleased with my bark and snowy sail, I freely gave them to the gale, And saw, with triumph, how I flew Past many a timid, loitering crew. Less bright, indeed, the ocean seem'd, Than view'd at distance, I had deem'd, And lovelier still, and lovelier grew The softening landscape that withdrew. When seaward far, I first perceive The crested billows rougher heave, And, while a cloud obscures the sun, Feel the keen gust precursive run Along the main. Alarm'd to find Such trackless distance left behind, I turn'd in terror toward the shore My venturous prow, but, 'midst the roar Of volleying thunder, hail, and rain, That burst tempestuous, strove in vain. While by the winds my slender bark Was hurried o'er the waters dark, Ah! then, how look'd my native dell! How sweet to fancy, who can tell! Dash'd on a lonely isle, at last, I, haply, by the shock was cast, Beyond the furious surges' reach, Wounded and senseless, on the beach. Who to relieve me now appears? Some Nymph unruffled ocean hears, On sunny days and silver nights, Warble along his rocky heights? Did those fair daughters of the wave Transport me to their sparry cave, And singing sweetly in my ear Recall the spirit to her sphere? Ah, no! those sirens never rise But when soft azure clothes the skies, And all their craggy islets sleep Reflected in the glassy deep, And gaudy barks with streamers gay Are lingering to applaud their lay: When seas are rough and tempests blow, They keep their coral bowers below. A hospitable matron bore My drench'd, cold members from the shore, Whose humble dwelling ever stood Open to sufferers from the flood. Each art reviving there she tries, Till life again relumed my eyes. When from the death-like swoon I woke, She gently thus the silence broke. “I need not, stranger, ask thy tale; I saw thee court the fav'ring gale; I know the picture fancy drew, Cheating thy inexperienced view. When, next, on Hope's fair hill you stand, Take Wisdom's volume in your hand; Compare the scene, at distance gay, With what those sacred pages say: They will reveal the hidden snare, Life's shoals and quicksands all declare; They tell of rocks and storms, in seas That scarcely seem to know a breeze; Of clouds that fatal tempests hold Beneath their gorgeous skirts of gold; When sun, nor star, displays its light, They can direct your feet aright; They will exalt your quickening eyes From earth's poor pageant to the skies.” Religion thus her thoughts express'd: I lock'd the counsel in my breast. THOMAS WELLS AT MUSING HOUR. At musing hour of twilight gray, When silence reigns around, I love to walk the churchyard way, To me 't is holy ground. To me, congenial is the place Where yew and cypress grow; I love the moss-grown stone to trace, That tells who lies below. And, as the lonely spot I pass Where weary ones repose, I think, like them, how soon alas! My pilgrimage will close. Like them, I think, when I am gone, And soundly sleep as they, Alike unnoticed, and unknown, Shall pass my name away. Yet ah! and let me lightly tread! She sleeps beneath this stone That would have soothed my dying bed, And wept for me when gone! Her image—'t is to memory dear— That clings around my heart, And makes me fondly linger here, Unwilling to depart. SOLITUDE. Embosom'd in thy shades, O Solitude! Thy leafy canopies and forests rude; Where silence reigns, save when the moping bird, Tuneless, from yonder ivied nook is heard To greet the coming night; remote from scenes of care, I sit me down your quietude to share; And all resign'd to contemplation's power, Devote to thee one still propitious hour; One hour, when, earth forgot, the spirit wings Her heaven-bound flight, and, as she upward springs, Seems to commune with long departed years, To talk with gods, and mingle with the spheres. Ye labyrinthian wilds, and russet glades— Dark-nodding pines, and venerable shades— Ye time-worn steeps of gray—ye hermit cells, Where, queen of sylvan talk, sweet echo dwells, Voiced daughter of the air—thou towering chain Of everlasting hills, whose tops attain The pendant cloud, and greet the morning beam— Fountains! from whose redundant bosoms stream The winding crystal brooks, and, as they take Their course, to fancy's ear wild music make; Ye oaks! briarean monarchs of the wood, That unsubdued the elements have stood; And still that seem indignant to defy The accumulated forces of the sky:— Abodes impervious to the day! Ye caves, That murmur to the distant roar of waves, When, by the winds upborne, old ocean pours His beating surge along the far-off shores; Ye rocks, colossal sentinels, whose forms For ages have withstood the siege of storms; Upon whose rough and adamantine peak, The earth-disdaining eagle whets his beak, Whence sightless soaring, ere the day's begun, Leaves the dark vales below, and welcomes up the sun: Ye consecrated haunts, long fondly woo'd On your repose no stranger feet intrude; Fled from the busy stirring city's hum, To your recess a worshipper I come; From a toss'd world, in thee a calm I find, Benign content—the sabbath of the mind. And thou, of these abodes, O genius blest, To your domain receive your votary guest; To you, amidst your sylvan lodge, and wild attire, The muse devotes the meditative lyre. Fill'd with thy presence, oft at twilight gray, What time begin to droop the things of day, When shadowy shapes, seen through the vapor dim, To fancy's bodying eye take form and limb; Along thy gloom's sequester'd paths I tread, And hold communion with the illustrious dead; Imagination then, with eye of light, Imps her bold wing and meditates her flight; To worlds unknown, from mortal bounds, she hies, Spurns the dull earth, and claims her kindred skies. There breathes a language in the trackless woods, In voiceless glens, and mountain solitudes; Amidst unpeopled rocks there lives for me A something more than man's society; I hear some call in every passing wind; In every tree a monitor I find; On every stone I trace a moral law, And from each brook an admonition draw:— Whate'er I note, or wheresoe'er I turn, From such mysterious Providence I learn; Above, around, beneath, impress'd I see The apparent finger of the Deity:— On every leaf, in each unfolding flower I read the imaged evidence of—power. Of power!—whose vital principle, from nought, This fair creation into being brought; Which will'd—and from oblivion rose the earth, From chaos, form; from lifeless matter, birth; Of power—the balanced worlds, on high, that hung, At whose omnific word the daybeam sprung, And all the morning stars together sung; O'er all created things supreme that reigns, Whose wisdom fashion'd, and whose might sustains. The noon of midnight reigns—the solemn hour O'er subject things the sovereignty of power Exclusive holds;—above, around, beneath, The all-pervading spirit seems to breathe Of musing loneliness—the cloudless sky— Earth's azure roof—a glorious canopy Stretches from verge to verge—serenely fair The stars look out through crystal fields of air, And, as in concert there they shine, dispense, To rapt devotion's eye, harmonious influence. Welcome ye thickets! hail propitious shade! Sacred to song—for contemplation made— Your quietude I court—hence be from me The crowded mart—the idle pageantry Of fool'd ambition's pride—the cares, the strife, Of cheated pleasure's superficial life:— But mine, be mine, your hospitable wild— Where halcyon peace, of heaven the favor'd child, Delights to dwell—be mine your dwelling rude, Bland nurse of thought—congenial Solitude. A VISION. A deep sleep came, and on my senses fell:— In solitude, upon a rock, whose brow Recumbent frown'd upon a mirror flood, Methought I stood:—In emerald array, A still immeasureable glassy tide In gentle beauty slept—while day-light stain'd, With parting hue, its bosom's quietude.— The worn-out winds had long ago expired, And with their lullaby, the weary waves Had cradled to their rest:—The weeping heavens Refreshing distillations shed, and hung Their jewelry upon the rosy skirts Of branch, and bank, and many an airy peak. Powder'd with gems, the distant valley seem'd With living constellations paved, and burnt Like molten diamonds. Such landscape once, The enraptured eye of Moses held enthrall'd, When near the borders of the promised land, From Pisgah's towering steep, the blissful shore Of Canaan he beheld.—Before my dream, A dismal, strange, and shadowy change now pass'd; In blood-red garments veil'd, solemn and slow, Climbing her height, uprose the dim, cold Moon;— As up she bent her never-sounding march, She seem'd to bode of skulls and sepulchres, Of sights unholy, and forbidden things;— Of death, and judgment, and the latter doom.— As on her course she kept, she seem'd to shed A mildew in the stagnant breeze.—A fog Now from the unwholesome earth arose, and fill'd With suffocating steams the burden'd air.— A sudden spirit seem'd the winds to move: The tide, which erst in waveless slumber lay, In strange commotion groan'd and hiss'd, and shook From the foundation of its boiling deep. The dews in heavy drops fell fast, and turn'd To clotted gore, mixing with blood, the marl;— The sobbing winds unearthly voices bore, Of lamentations deep, and speechless wail;— While, ever anon between, arose Commingled sounds, as from unquiet souls, Or unlaid spirits, issuing; strange and wild The noises grew, and seem'd like funeral dirge Of maniac harpers on the midnight wave; Then ceased each sound, and all a while was hush'd, Save the deep chiming of the distant knell That heavily along the waters roll'd, And from her den the hungry she-wolf woke, Who with a famish'd howl re-echoed back The solemn vesper bell:—Now suddenly From trumpet's throat unseen, a stirring peal The alarming summons rung, which on the ear Of fix'd astonishment awoke a pang Insufferably keen:—The forests bent Their giant limbs, and shook their tenants forth;— Whilst dove and vulture, in promiscuous fright, With staggering wing confusedly outpour'd, And dash'd them in the flood: fierce from her steep On sinewy pinions borne, the Eagle rush'd,— In noble wrath, she stretch'd her meteor flight To untried regions, thence, to gaze upon The idol of her scorching eye:—still up, With glance electric, and with iron beak, She bent her bosom 'gainst the thunder cloud; Fearless the tempest in his fury met, And scream'd her requiem to departed day. The ancient column, and the battlement, From their firm bases reeling, to the ground In thundering ruin fell:—Convulsed, methought I heard the world's expiring groan,—old earth From her remotest recess, back return'd The final cry, and render'd up herself.— And now, emerging from their dreams profound Awoke the relics, which, for ages had In their dark chambers slept:—With hurried pace, The sheeted figures, with inquietude Hover'd about the confines of their home;— Long, long, in darkness and oblivion quench'd, Their eyes with marble stupefaction roll'd, And glared in monumental mockery. A blighting dew, cadaverous and chill, Crept o'er my mouldering limbs:—I felt Decay With rotten fingers touch my very heart!— An apparition to my soul he seem'd, Too horrible for thought, unutterable, Ghastly!—while on his carrion visage stood The crusted mildew of the charnel-house; And from his worm-gnawn body dropp'd away The flesh, corruption long had fed upon:— Fast to my breast the ugly spectre clung;— Within my vitals fix'd his mouldy grasp, And with abominable transport wood My captive soul, that, struggling, tugg'd in vain, To free the spirit from her dungeon clay.— “Be mine!” exulting cried the fiend, “Be mine!” While through the portals of my hearing, rung The long and horrid laugh, the laugh of hell!— An overwhelming flame before my eyes With fury flash'd, that all around appear'd, A wilderness of intermittent fires.— A sudden, burning pang,—no more,—'t was gone. Methought, to my astonish'd vision now, Outnumbering cherubim and seraphim Freckled with stars, their wings of light reveal'd, And through the crystal chambers of the sky, Celestial odors fann'd; while radiant hung Their alabaster harps, self-tuned—methought Intuitive the wires in concert play'd, And to the winds in conscious numbers sung.— At intervals responsive voices stole, And breathed around such heavenly harmony, That things inanimate became all ear;— E'en death itself put old oblivion off, And, reinstated, felt young life again.— Such sights, for ever shut from mortal eyes, Such sounds, prohibited the mortal ear, I trembling woke; and, for a while, intent, Listen'd, and look'd, and thought the Vision real. THE BATTLE OF NEW ORLEANS. Chill was the breeze,—nor yet the herald light Had chased the lingering shadows of the night; O'er still expanse of lake, and marshy bed, Gloomy and dense the mantling vapors spread:— But soon the battle-flash that darkness broke, And soon, that dread repose, the peal awoke Of loud artillery, and the dire alarms Of mingling conflict, and the clash of arms. Fate gave the word!—and now, by veterans led, In pride of chivalry, to conquest bred, The foe advanced—entrenched, the champion band Of Freemen stood, the bulwark of the land; Fearless their stars unfurl'd, and, as the rock, Storm-proof, they stood, impervious to the shock: Their patriot Chief, with patriot ardor fired— Nerved every hand, and every heart inspired; Himself, in peril's trying hour, a host, A nation's rescue, and a nation's boast;— Empower'd alike to govern, or to save, To guide a people, or their sword to wave. As near the bastion'd wall th' Invader drew, A storm of iron hail to greet him flew; On havoc's wing the mission'd vengeance rode, And whole platoons the scythe of ruin mow'd; Through paths of blood, o'er undistinguish'd slain, Unyoked, the hungry war-dogs scour'd the plain; Borne on the blast, the scattering besom kept Its course, and ranks on ranks promiscuous swept;— The trophied Lion fell,—while o'er his foes Unscathed, in arms supreme, the towering Eagle rose.— Sublime in majesty,—matchless in might— Columbia stood, unshaken in the fight: From lips of adamant, 'midst volumed smoke And cataracts of fire, her thunders spoke In triumph to the skies; from shore to shore, Old Mississippi shook, and echoed to the roar. High on his sceptred perch, our mountain bird, Amidst the din the shout of Victory heard— Exulting heard, and from his eyry came Through rolling war-clouds, and through sheets of flame; Renown's immortal meed he bore, and spread His ample pinions o'er the conqueror's head— The Hero of the West—to him assign'd The glorious palm, and round his brows the guerdon twined. SONNET. Ye clouds, that in your breasts the tempest bear, From whose dark folds the nimble lightnings leap; Tell us, as through the vault of blue ye sweep, Whence came ye, rolling in your strength, and where Shadowing the heavens, do you now bend your course? Shipwreck attends, dread messengers, your path— The giant forests stoop before your wrath, And Ocean bends his trident to your force: Already now your winged bolts of fire The skies inflame—your pealing thunders roll, And seem the earth to shake, from pole to pole, Whilst hail and whirlwind mingle with your ire? Mortal!—seek not the Eternal to explore,— We come his errands to fulfil—be silent and adore. WILLIAM B. TAPPAN RETROSPECTION. 'T is sweet, in seclusion, to look on the past, In life's sober twilight recall the day-dream; To mark the smooth sunshine, and skies overcast, That chequer'd our course as we moved down the stream. For O there 's a charm in retracing the morn, When the star of our pleasure beam'd brightly awhile, And the tear that in infancy water'd the thorn, By the magic of memory is changed to a smile. How faint is the touch, no perspective bestowing, Nor scenery in nature's true colors array'd; How chaste is the landscape, how vividly glowing, Where the warm tint of fancy is mellowed by shade! With cheerfulness then, Retrospection, I'll greet thee, Though the nightshade be twined in thy bouquet of sweets, In the eve of reflection this bosom will meet thee, While to the dear vision of childhood it beats. And the heart that in confidence seeks its review, And finds the calm impress of innocence there, With rapture anticipates happiness new, In hope yet to come, it possesses a share. If in worlds beatific, affections unite, And those once dissever'd are blended in love; If dreams of the past quicken present delight, Retrospection adds bliss to the spotless above. WHY SHOULD WE SIGH? Why should we sigh when Fancy's dream, The ray that shone 'mid youthful tears, Departing, leaves no kindly gleam, To cheer the lonely waste of years? Why should we sigh?—The fairy charm That bound each sense in folly's chain Is broke, and Reason, clear and calm, Resumes her holy rights again. Why should we sigh that earth no more Claims the devotion once approved? That joys endear'd, with us are o'er, And gone are those these hearts have loved? Why should we sigh?—Unfading bliss Survives the narrow grasp of time; And those that asked our tears in this, Shall render smiles in yonder clime. WHEN DEATH SHALL LAY. When death shall lay this bosom low, And every murmur hush to sleep, When those that give affection now, Shall o'er affection's memory weep, I would not, when life's spark has flown, That strangers should receive the sigh; I would not, that a hand unknown, Should, reckless, close the slumbering eye: But, on some throbbing breast reclined, That beat alone to love and me, Each parting pang subdued, how kind, How peaceful, would my exit be. I would not, that this lowly head Should pillow, cold, on foreign clay; I would not, that my grassy bed Should be from home and love away: But, in my native village ground, Near kindred dust, these relics laid: How calm my slumbers, how profound, Beneath the old tree's sombre shade. O COME FROM A WORLD. O come from a world, where sorrow and gloom, Chastise the allurements of joy; A pathway bedimm'd, with no rays to illume, Save the meteor that shines to destroy; Where the thoughtless have revell'd, when mirth had no charm, Where the wounded have wept, but still needed the balm. O come from a world, where the landscape is chill, Or deceitfully blossoming fair, The garden gives promise of bright flowers, still, The nightshade luxuriates there; That sky, now serene, blushing lovely and clear, O heed not its beauty, the storm-cloud is near. O come from a world, where the cup of delight Now sparkles and foams at the brim; For the laurels that wreath it, reflection shall blight, Its lustre, repentance shall dim; The lips, that convivial, have pledged thee the bowl, Shall blanch with confusion when fear rives the soul. O come from a world, where they that beguile Will lead thee to peril and fears; For the heart that, confiding, hath welcomed its smile, Hath found it the prelude to tears: Come then, there 's a path by the reckless untrod; O come, weary wanderer, it leads to thy God. TO THE NORTH STAR. Bright Star, while thou thy lonely way Pursu'st in yon expanse of blue, Thy gem-like form and steady ray Attract the heedless peasant's view, And his, whose thoughts to unknown regions stray. Full oft the wanderer, fortune's child, Benighted, sad, and doom'd to roam, Beholds with joy thy aspect mild, That tells of happiness and home, And guides him onward 'mid the trackless wild. Oft, too, the sea-boy marks thy beam, When ocean sleeps in peaceful calm; While o'er its breast thy gentle gleam Plays wanton, and with sacred charm Lulls the wrapt soul in fancy's pleasing dream. And oft, sweet Star, at even-tide, When all around is hush'd to rest, My thoughts ascend, and pensive glide To distant climes and regions blest, Where wo-worn care and grief would gladly hide. And fancy whispers in mine ear, That those who once were here beloved, To friendship and affection dear, Now from this fleeting scene removed, Repose, bright Star, in thy ethereal sphere. SAMUEL H. JENKS O! MAY WE NOT WEEP? “Weep not for those whom the veil of the tomb.”— Moore. O! may we not weep for the loved who have fled From our presence on earth, though their home be in heaven; And may not our tears at the grave of the dead, When flowing in silence and hope, be forgiven? Shall death seize unheeded the friends of our bosom, The fairest and mildest in life's lovely bloom; And throw them, unmourn'd, like the funeral blossom, To fade and corrode in the damps of the tomb? O! may we not sorrow for those who have fled From our presence on earth, though their home be in heaven; And may not our tears at the grave of the dead, When flowing in silence and hope, be forgiven? Unmoved shall we wake from the dreams we enjoy'd, And find all our visions by death rudely torn? Our peace by the sweeping blast rent and destroy'd— Like brutes shall we brook, or like man shall we mourn? For, though quietly seal'd in the sepulchre's slumber, The forms of our valued companions repose; E'en though with the spirits of bliss THEY may number, Yet may we not weep for OUR wasteness and woes? Then say not, ye piously stern, that our grief Should be quench'd in oblivion, or frigidly borne:— When the mildews of fate blight the young tender leaf, 'T is Nature's COMMAND, and MAN'S DUTY, to mourn. THE PATRIOT'S GRAVE. On the spot where my war-couch stood, Where my spring-time of fame was pass'd, Where the patriot's prayer, and the hero's blood Pour'd fervently and fast— Where the spirit of glory stole O'er my earliest and brightest dream, With the trumpet's blast and the drum's rude roll, And the falchion's dazzling gleam— Lay me down on that hallow'd spot— Long in peace I may there remain; For the foeman's standard now waveth not On yonder battle-plain. When this weary and struggling soul From its bondage of clay hath fled, Make my humble grave on yon grassy knoll, 'T is a meet and quiet bed! On its brow there 's a blasted oak, Like its withering branch am I; Yet though ravens there may be heard to croak, Heaven's softest breeze shall sigh:— And, my children, a stream glides there, Gently laving its verdant base;— Of perennial bliss 't is an emblem fair— It shall mark my resting place! Once the proud and the gallant tread Of the warrior press'd that mound; But his comrades soon o'er the prostrate dead May pour the farewell round. And when cometh my final strife, Let me be with my comforter, That the last fond gaze of expiring life Be consecrate to her. Then if far, far beyond the grave, Be the memory's employment free, It shall cherish the look that affection gave, In all eternity! O! 't is sweet, when my task is done, Thus to witness my banner furl'd:— When the storm is spent, so the setting sun Smiles on a parting world! POWERS OF RHYME. People do n't commonly discern The difference 'twixt POETRY and RHYME: The former can be made to thrill and burn, By master geniuses—and yet No two words shall together chime. E'en Prose, so called, may be po-et- I-cal, and ring upon the ear Harmoniously, without a grain of jingle; While Rhyme, all sound, with oftentimes No symptom of idea, Clinking, like handfuls of new dimes, Causes one's very brain to tingle. Some folks, new words will manufacture, That have no sense nor meaning:— They would denominate a crack a cracture, Or, to make rhyme, call obloquy obscening! The name of my French friend, Piemont, (A name that 's smooth enough in song,) Has often been distorted into Pie-mont— A hill of pies!—just to make rhyme on't! This brings me to the tale that I was going To tell, of Toby Grizzle, a rough clown Who grew up in the country—for in town The folks are polish'd, and extremely knowing. Toby had never seen great towns and cities, Where houses grow together by the acre; To die then, and see only what his Maker Had done in lands, and woods, and cattle— Thought Toby, “'twere a thousand pities; So, down to Boston, in my cart I'll rattle.” So down he went, And turn'd up at the Indian Queen; Amazement and astonishment— At what he saw, And what was to be seen, Hung heavily upon his under-jaw. This made him hungry, and he bought A yard of gingerbread to stay his yearnings, And after various crooks and turnings He got into the parlor, as he thought; But, reader, 't was the kitchen— So droll was everything—and so bewitching. The cook, of his poetic powers was boasting; Betwixt whom and the scullion there arose A disputation, whether rhyme or prose Most clear ideas convey'd— —Beef was there roasting By dint of a huge jack—custom antique! “Now,” quoth the cook, “I'll speak In verse to this fat lout, and ascertain Whether my rhymes be not, to all men, plain.” Says he to Toby, “May I be so bold As to inquire how many hours have roll'd Since you into these regions stroll'd?” Quoth Toby, casting up his eager looks To where the giddy jack-wheel whirl'd— “Odsbludikins, and snaggers! rat it, and adzooks! Your clock goes faster than aunt Katy's; And I'll be skinn'd and darn'd, for all the world, If I can see to tell what time o' day 't is.” ANTHONY BLEECKER. ON REVISITING THE COTTAGE OF ROSA IN EARLY SPRING, AFTER A LONG ABSENCE. Seven summers have flown, and once more do I see The fields and the groves I deserted so long: Scarce a bud yet appears on the winter-beat tree, Nor a bird yet enlivens the sky with a song. For though spring has returned, yet the chilly wind blows, And the violets and daisies still hide in the ground; But one dear little flower, one beautiful Rose, Here blooms and here blushes the seasons all round. Thou pride of the plain, little queen of the grove, Still fresh is thy foliage and sweet thy perfume, And still the bright object of Paridel's love, As when thy first buds were beginning to bloom. And though fate has decreed that he must not aspire This blossom divine on his bosom to wear, Yet still must he cherish the tender desire, And make thee forever the theme of his prayer. Blow gently, ye zephyrs, be genial, ye showers, Bright and warm be the sky o'er thy dear native vale, And may no bitter blast ever ravage the bowers That guard thy fair frame from the merciless gale. And when the short season of blooming shall end, Which fate to the children of nature hath given, May some cherub of beauty, to snatch thee, descend, And bear thee to bloom in the gardens of heaven. TRENTON FALLS, NEAR UTICA. Ye hills, who have for ages stood Sublimely in your solitude, Listening the wild water's roar, As thundering down, from steep to steep, Along your wave-worn sides they sweep, Dashing their foam from shore to shore. Wild birds, that loved the deep recess, Fell beast that roved the wilderness, And savage men once hover'd round: But startled at your bellowing waves, Your frowning cliffs, and echoing caves, Affrighted fled the enchanted ground. How changed the scene!—your lofty trees, Which bent but to the mountain breeze, Have sunk beneath the woodman's blade; New sun-light through your forest pours, Paths wind along your sides and shores, And footsteps all your haunts invade. Now boor, and beau, and lady fair, In gay costume each day repair, Where thy proud rocks exposed stand, While echo, from her old retreats, With babbling tongue strange words repeats, From babblers on your stony strand. And see—the torrent's rocky floor, With names and dates all scribbled o'er, Vile blurs on nature's heraldry; O bid your river in its race, These mean memorials soon efface, And keep your own proud album free. Languid thy tides, and quell'd thy powers, But soon Autumnus with his showers, Shall all thy wasted strength restore; Then will these ramblers down thy steep, With terror pale their distance keep, Nor dare to touch thy trembling shore. But spare, Oh! river, in thy rage, One name upon thy stony page; 'Tis hers—the fairest of the fair; And when she comes these scenes to scan, Then tell her, Echo, if you can, His humble name who wrote it there. JUNGFRAU SPAIGER'S APOSTROPHE TO HER CAT. A late London paper mentions that the celebrated Manheim Telescope, the master-piece of the famous Spaiger, a Hungarian optician, was recently destroyed in a singular manner. A servant of the Observatory having taken out the glasses to clean them, put them in again, without observing that a cat had crept into the tube. At night, the animal being alarmed at the strong powers of the Lunar rays, endeavored to escape; but the effort threw down the instrument, which, falling to the ground from the top of a tower, was broken to pieces. The writer, presuming that the cat was killed by the fall, imagines the daughter of the astronomer as breaking forth in the following Lament. What whisker'd ghost, at this mild moonlight hour, Invites my steps, and points to yonder tower? 'Tis Puss, my darling Puss; all bleeding! pale! Gash'd are her ears, and scotch'd her lengthy tail. Oh, tell thy tale, and I will lend an ear— Then sweep to my revenge, Grimalkin, dear. Oh say, did boys, or other cruel hounds, Conspire thy death, and give those ghastly wounds? Or, tell me Puss, 'tis what I dread the most, Did some Kilkenny cat make thee a ghost? Canst thou not speak? Ah then I'll seek the cause; What see I here? the bloody prints of paws; And oh, chaste stars! what broken limbs appear, Here lie thy legs; the Telescope's lie here. The Telescope o'erturn'd;—too plain I see The cause, the cause of thy cat-astrophe. Was it for this, my sire on topmost tower, Gazed at the stars till midnight's dewy hour, Outwatch'd the Bear, and saw Orion rise, While Hesper lent her light to other skies? Was it for this, he gave such strict command, To clean the glasses with a careful hand, And then to search the tube with nicest care, To see nor cat, nor kit, were nestling there; Lest, like old Sidrophel, star-gazing wight, Who wisely made a comet of a kite, My cat, perhaps, 'twixt Mercury and Mars, Had help'd to swell the cat-alogue of stars. O! say what led thee to that giddy height, Thou Queen of cats! that witching time of night; Was it cat-optrics fired thy feline heart, And didst thou dare to act the sage's part, And peeping at the moon, while stretch'd at ease, Discover with delight 'twas all green cheese? Or didst thou wish to take a near survey, Of that delicious stream, the milky-way, And while the dog-star in the welkin raves, To take a leap, and lap its cream-clad waves? Ah me! what terrors through thy frame were spread, When Luna's rays refracted on thy head, And fill'd thy gooseberry eyes with beams so thick, No wonder thou becam'st a lunatic; Lost all reflection; scarce retain'd a hope, Immured in a reflecting telescope. The concave mirror first thy fury bore, The convex lens but vexed thee the more: Then all thy rage was to a focus brought; To tilt the tube was now thy only thought; Flounce—bounce:—it tumbles from the turret wall, Breaking itself, but breaking not thy fall! Oh direful fall!—But why indulge this wo? Can cat-aracts of tears avail thee now? No; thou art bound to Hecate's wizzard shore, Where Whittington's famed cat has gone before; And to appease thy ghost my task shall be, To consecrate a cat-acomb to thee. Embalm'd, dear shade, with true Egyptian care, Across the Atlantic wave thy corpse I'll bear, And where old Catskill props the western sky, The fur-clad relics of my cat shall lie. There shall thy favorite herbs and plants be found, The cat-mint there shall shed its sweets around; The savory mushroom from the sod shall start, And to the breeze its catsup sweets impart. While the tall cat-tail, on the reedy shore, Shall hang his head, and thy sad fate deplore. One warbler of the grove will ne'er forget To pay to thee his grateful, tuneful debt; The cat-bird, perch'd on the catalpa tree, Shall squall that note he learnt, poor puss, from thee, While from the mount, the valley, and the plain, The weeping pole-cat shall repeat the strain. EPITAPH OF MORNAI DU PLESSIS, IMITATED FROM THE LATIN OF GROTIUS. Nobility of soul, by nature given, Nobler than blood of proud ancestral line; Skill in the laws of men, and truths of Heaven, Maturest counsel; eloquence divine, With Mornai here repose;—his tomb their hallow'd shrine. G. A. GAMAGE MY EARLY DAY. “My early day, what joys were thine!” And yet thou hadst some sorrows too; A varied wreath they join'd to twine, And 'midst it hope her blossoms threw— Borne on the breeze, her rosy kiss Bade pleasure sojourn there, Love came to tune her lute of bliss, And requiems sung to care. Dear days of peace! ah, whither fled? O'er my young bower ye did but hover, Then, like the dove, your pinions spread, And sought your home—the skies, forever! Your morning gales my path beguiled, Nor whisper'd they should die so soon; Nor each bright bud that round it smiled, Dream of departing ere 't was noon. But those are hush'd, and these are gone, And sadness rules the blighted scene; I wander downcast and alone, Scarce mindful they have ever been! So chill, time's marble foot hath pass'd Through childhood's dimpled vale, No herb can bloom, no verdure last, To cheer life's evening pale. Sweet hours! with golden pastimes fraught, On you I turn my streaming eye And think—and in that racking thought, My heart—my gushing heart would die. Ye conjure up each once-loved form, Each well-remember'd voice awaken— Then show me how they met the storm, And sunk, on joy's bright shore forsaken. Ne'er shall they mount with me again, I loved so well—yon sunny steep; One stroke hath dash'd our hands in twain, And 'neath its broomwood hedge they sleep. His pang descends not to their bed, Who sickens round the scene, To know life's infant flowers are dead, Its riper thorns yet green. On wing more swift than morning lark, My faded years unloved are borne;— Where wilt thou land me, oh my bark, If not to youth's dear port we turn? Must man o'erpass the beckoning vale, And all its winning sweets renounce?— And all its winning sweets renounce?— He freights his bark but once! Oh tell me, “step-dame nature,” tell, Where shall thy wayward child abide, On what far strand his spirit dwell, When life has spent its struggling tide? Shall hope no more her taper mourn, Quench'd in the tear that sorrow sends; Nor from the feast misfortune spurn The wishful wretch that o'er it bends? No more shall folly's yellow wing O'er pleasure's path shed sickly dews? Nor youth's delightful day of spring 'Mid grief's dim cloud its lustre lose? Say—ne'er shall wealth's gay-spangled plume Deceive, as when it erst was mine? Nor love turn shuddering from the tomb; Nor joy at her short reign repine? And when the grave its grassy veil Between these eyes and life shall spread, Shall memory blight the primrose pale, That kindly strives to shade my bed? Or shall the form that slumbers there, No more of pain nor death endure? Oh, pour thine answer on my ear— “I've told thee—told thee, child—NO MORE!” ALBERT G. GREENE LINES. My object was to describe in some slight degree, the effects of that propensity of the mind to be discontent with the real allotment of its situation, which is continually prompting it to dream of, and to seek for, more perfect fruition of the real joys of life, or of the imaginary ones of its waking dreams; and to show, that this feeling has been the cause of many proud and noble achievements; the spring of many of the highest and most daring efforts of the imagination; and what is of far more importance, the source of religious hope and faith, so far as these are not founded on Revelation itself. Preface of the Author. How many wearied spirits have forgot The pain and sorrow of their earthly lot, Through Fancy's bright creations, tracing o'er Some path of light, by Genius trod before; While o'er the lyre, some gifted minstrel flings A master's hand to wake its living strings, Whose notes a bright and cheering spell can throw Around the spirit in its hour of wo; Can bid long vanish'd hope to life return, And teach e'en rankling hate less deep to burn; Until the latent virtue wakes, within The heart long burden'd with accusing sin; O'er its crush'd pride a healing influence pour, And call up feelings never known before; And come, with power assuasive of its pain; Like Jubal's music o'er the soul of Cain. Though mazed in error, and defiled by sin, The human soul still bears a light within, Unquench'd, unquenchable, of heavenly birth, Which, when refined from all the dross of earth, Will not less brightly shine, than that, which now Sheds glory round the burning seraph's brow. And was this spark, from heaven's own altar caught, Shrined in the human spirit then, for nought? It is not so:—far be the thought profane;— God never gave so rich a gift in vain. 'T is this which yields all true poetic fire; Which gives its soul of music to the lyre: And, when from raptured thought, its numbers swell, Makes its deep tones a mystery and a spell. The gifted bard, to faith's extatic gaze, Her shadowy worlds with brighter forms arrays; Prompts each fond hope, for happier scenes, to rise Beyond this earth and all its transient ties, In scenes of more enduring joy to live, Than all its transient wealth and pomp can give. For this, how rich the bright returns, which pour On the rapt bard from faith's unbounded store; She throws a deeper spell around his dreams, And gives his thrilling song its noblest themes. Though oft the Bard's high gift may be misused; And faith deceived, insulted and abused; That light within the soul, though misemploy'd, May long be dimm'd, but cannot be destroy'd; For higher good, it still will prompt desire; Fix'd in its laws, as earth's material fire; Which, though on every side extends its rays, Still upward ever points the unchanging blaze. Proud are the treasures of enduring worth The sons of Genius have bequeathed to earththe mighty thrill'd with fear At the dim visions of the aged Seer:— For this, the blood of sacrifice hath flow'd, The incense burn'd, the votive altar glow'd: From this, arose the spirit-stirring deeds, The deep- toned song, the strange, unearthly creeds, The wild, the dark, the fearful and sublime, That fill the annals of the olden time. When mild refinement first begins to pour Her faintest rays o'er some benighted shore, E'en then, within the rude untutor'd breast, Will thoughts arise which cannot be repress'd. Impatient, then, it strives to rend away The shadowy veil which shrouds its future way; And at each step, its aspirations rise For brighter scenes and higher destinies; And hopes are felt, unwearied and intense, For scenes of joy beyond the bounds of sense; Till led by these, the long excited mind Is wrapt in visions, dim and undefined; Till from the scenes of many a cherish'd dream, It rears some wild and visionary scheme; To which, at length, the wearied mind adheres, To calm its doubts and soothe its varied fears. Then promised joys will haunt the mental view; And fancy dream, till faith believes then true; Whose power, in bright perspective, then reveals Her blissful bowers and fair elysian fields; Some gorgeous paradise of future rest, Some verdant, cloudless island of the blest; Where the freed soul will find its destined meed For high endurance, or for dauntless deed; For which the heart, in full confiding trust, Will smile at fate, and calmly dare its worst; The full fruition of those joys to gain, For which, on earth, it pines and strives in vain; Can spurn at savage torture, and can brave The shafts of death, the darkness of the grave. Such was the faith, whose all absorbing sway Was deeply felt in Europe's early day; When by the watchfires of the battle plain, The Runic bard pour'd forth his thrilling strain; And roused the bosoms of the warrior throng, With the wild themes of Scandinavian song:— Told, that whene'er their closing battle cry O'er the red field rose pealing to the sky, From the dark regions of the stormy North, The spirits of their sires were issuing forth; The stern bold warriors of the olden time, Whose names still lived in many a martial rhyme; All, whose proud deeds were consecrate to fame, Like eagles o'er the field of slaughter came, In legions hovering in the viewless air, The parting spirits of the slain to bear To the vast hall of Odin; there to see The joyous banquet spread eternally; To hear the war-songs of their fathers, pour'd From unseen harps, around the festive board; While crown'd with joy, the sateless wassail cup, With its bright mead for ever sparkling up, Still, round the throng, should pass, with ceaseless flow, To drown remembrance of all earthly wo. Thus, when amid our western forests' gloom, The captive warrior hears the words of doom; His daring heart, to high endurance wrought, Is fill'd with all his father's faith have taught; And all his own long cherish'd dreams, once more O'er his rapt soul, their strengthening influence pour; 'Till nature sinks exhausted with her strife, Beneath the glowing fire, the torturing knife. E'en when the throe of mortal agony Thrills through his heart and flashes from his eye, One word of pride upon his foes is cast, One glance of scorn the fiercest and the last. Have not his fathers taught, that death like this Is but the herald to a world of bliss;— That 't is but pain's last trial; whence, the soul Shall pass, no more to feel its stern control: A dreamless sleep, from which it soon will wake, By the blue waters of the sunny lake; To range for ever round its peaceful shore, Where pain and torture can be felt no more. 'T is faith thus wrought, whose fearful mysteries Yield e'en weak woman strength for deeds like these; And bid, by Ganges' sacred stream, arise The fires of self-devoting sacrifice: While comes, for death array'd, without a tear, The Indian widow, with her husband's bier. Whate'er the gifts, rank, beauty, wealth, confer, She feels, this world hath nothing more for her. Through life, through death, indissolubly wed, They must not part:—her place is by the dead. And by that bier, with music and with song, Behind the bright-robed priests, she moves along, Amid the scenes of this terrific hour, To seal the pledges of her bridal bower. And there is shrined within that troubled breast, By all its boding terrors unrepress'd, Power to defy the fire's consuming pain; And feel that it doth not defy in vain. Why stands she now, amid the circling dance, Nor gives to aught around, one heeding glance? Why doth she gaze upon the viewless air, As if some guardian spirit hover'd there? 'T is not the priest's slow death-chaunt that she hears;— A holier music strikes her listening ears. 'T is not his thrilling exhortation now That gives its life to her uplifted brow. Hands, voices, urge her to the fatal spot; And chide her lingering: but she heeds them not. No; there are strains of more etherial tone, Unearthly music, heard by her alone. Her country's deities are circling nigh; She hears ten thousand voices in the sky. “We have prepared for her the bridal wreath, Who keeps her faith triumphant over death. Oh, haste to meet, once more, the approving smile Of him thou mournest, lost to thee awhile. There are fair isles beyond the dark blue sea, For those who keep their plighted faith like thee; Where the blest spirits of the faithful rove In one unchanging round of joy and love; By sunny waters and unfading bowers, And golden fruits, and ever blooming flowers. Oh, what is there, that world of wo within, Like those high joys which thou so soon may'st win?” With step elate, she gains her destined seat; And sees the red torch waving at her feet. By him the loved one, hand in hand the while, She proudly sits amid the blazing pile; And as the flames enwrap each quivering limb, Raises aloft her wild funereal hymn:— Swan-like, pours forth her last departing breath, Amidst the anguish of the fires of death. LUCIFER. Son of the Morning: where art thou? Where is thy heaven-born glory now? Borne down by the Eternal Will, O'erpower'd, but retaining still Some traces of thy noble part, Sublime in ruin still thou art. Son of the Morning; once, thy form Was with celestial beauty warm. The matchless grace which then it show'd, In the third heaven's refulgence glow'd. What peerless notes were on thy tongue, When loud the blest Hosanna rung. Thou wert the brightest in the zone Of seraphs round the eternal throne: That sight was open unto thee, Which mortal eye can never see: Thy feet, with Heaven's own radiance bright, Once trod the paths of living light: None but the arm of Might divine Could hurl thee from a seat like thine! Son of the Morning: where art thou; Where is thy heaven-born glory now?— Thy form: there is a grandeur there, But 't is the grandeur of despair: There is a radiance in thine eyes, But 't is the fire that never dies.— Still in thy degradation, great, Despising time, and scorning fate. Redeeming love is not for thee: Immutable is Heaven's decree: Ages shall pass to ages gone; Eternity will circle on; All mortal joy and wo will cease; All nature's motion be at peace; But thou must stand, from all apart, And be, for ever, what thou art. Immutable thy fate must be; Redeeming love is not for thee. WILLIAM H. BRADLEY GIUSEPPINO. To tell good stories is extremely pleasant; To hear or read them, too, is quite agreeable; And, from the courtier downward to the peasant, Tales are retail'd by all.—You'll even see a belle Or dandy thus employ'd: so I, at present, If Dan Apollo will but render me able, Am much inclined to give you a short specimen Of what occurr'd to one of the most dressy men. Authorship now is an improving business; If one can strike out matters that are novel. Though authors' brains will often get a dizziness, From too much labor, or be forced to grovel In plagiarisms, undoubtedly it is an ease To knock out rhyme or prose, whether a hovel Or palace be the scene of the disturbance Which we describe, among hats, caps, or turbans. Yet wonderful it is, I sing and say, Most marvellous, what ever-varied-changes Of narrative are dealt out, every day, As fancy, in her drunken frolics, ranges Throughout invention's heaven and hell!—Delay Is dangerous, however wild and strange is What I'm about to write, so I must write it For fear some other person should indite it. I sate me down, good folk, to tell a story, Of which, I own, the truth might be suspected, Even by credulous people; and, what's more, I Freely confess, I cannot recollect it: But yet it was a vision of such glory I scarcely can suppose ye would reject it. 'T was all about a lady and a knight, Who said and did—what I've forgotten quite In search of scenes and incidents I read Near half the old romances, through and through, Which Southey has brought forward from the dead, With most Galvanic labor, and anew, With steel clad wights, in peril was I led, Till weary of their toils and mine I grew: So the chief knowledge gather'd from my reading Is what I'll mention as we are proceeding. I found that many a literary chieftain, Had cull'd the gems from out this antique treasure; That what they left was by each humbler thief ta'en, To put in some new fiction at his leisure; I found—but guess!—no, you can't guess my grief ta'en At finding—Oh, presumption beyond measure!— That collar-makers—I can scarce get farther Had actually collar'd poor king Arthur. I next discover'd, that the folk of quality Had not, of yore, such numerous expedients To kill time and themselves, as the plurality Of modern genteel people. The ingredients With which they sweeten'd up the cold reality Were tourneys and such savage kind of pageants, Wherein legs, arms, and necks oft got a fracture, Although of the most giant manufacture. Sad was the situation of the fair, Long, while a Bolingbroke, or a Plantagenet Was king in London, (a great lord elsewhere) When one short week had stupor for an age in it, To “ladies gay,” who spent the livelong year, Remote from town, and truly would imagine it Extravagant to give, in their own halls, During that livelong year, one dozen balls. Then was the ton, indeed a weighty matter, Which fancy moved but every hundred years To a new pressure! Then a lady, at her First coming out, wore the same woman's gears Which she wore on, (unless she grew much fatter) Till she was going out; when lo, appears Her daughter, deck'd in the same antique millinery, With much manslaughter and intent to kill in her eye. 'T was better with them, as historians tell us, In bluff King Hal's reign, and some time before him, Though wives dared seldom flirt with civil fellows, In presence of their husbands, just to bore 'em. They fear'd to make the horrid creatures jealous, And females were taught notions of decorum, Stiff as their stomacher's tight elongation, Or neck cloths of this stiff-neck'd generation. Oh, could they have made books like lady M—n, What patchwork had we seen of feudal foolery! Each lady's head, like that of lady Gorgon, Had left us hard examples of their drollery, And we had known the centuries afore-gone, From banquet-hall quite downward to the scullery! Would that our dear ancestresses had been crazy, With some diverting kind of idiosyncrasy. I bit my nails and pens, and then besprent all My paper o'er with ink, in thought oppress'd; Next, I resolved to write an Oriental Tale, and set out in ‘Travels to the East,’ Driving away all notions Occidental.— I form'd a plot, and laid the scene, at last, Somewhere between Calcutta and Aleppo, When I bethought me of my old friend Beppo. Then,—as I opened wide the window-shutter,— A light broke in on me, as bright as sudden. Invention's wings began, at once, to flutter, (They had been once a goose's,) so, by Woden, I sate down, to soar far from dust or gutter, While my good Genius said: “Pray where 's the good in Your knack at rhyming, if its versatility Can't afford matter for our risibility? The Beppo has outdone the Epic style.— Most modern Epics really are provoking To sleep—and therefore, in a little while, The pack hight servum pecus shall have broken Into full cry;—leave your heroic toil, And start before them, till you have your book in The gripe of printer's demon's!”—on this hint, I wrote,—and having written, came to print. But how to make a story?—There's the puzzle! Foregad, we have such multitudes to tell us Stories on stories, both of those that guzzle At Helicon, and plain prosaic fellows, That no one soon shall find a nook to nuzzle In fiction's storehouse:—Fate will yet compel us To be mere readers. O ye geese and ganders, Your wings shall cease to soar where Fancy wanders. And here I humbly hint to Dr Brewster, That if he'd make us a kaleidoscope To strike new subjects out, at every new stir, 'T would give poor authors a consoling hope; For though the muses, when we call them, do stir, They 're monstrous indolent, and apt to mope. The three times three, of late, are growing slatterns, As I suppose, for want of good new patterns. I'll try to coax one of them now a little For something queer, good people to revive you. Some tale of luckless love will not befit ill Your present taste, and this which now I give you Will, without question, suit you to a tittle, If ye are young men and intend to wive you. Hear then the history, both sad and funny, Of one who fell to much in love—with money. This is the love which first inflames the bosom, When for a penny some dear infant screeches. This is the love which constantly pursues 'em, When fellows have got into coat and breeches, And sigh for guineas,—then sigh for a new sum.— This lasting passion to all bosoms reaches, Strengthen'd by age's weakness:—all love sham is, Compared with this same ‘auri sacra fames.’ But hold:—I feel myself too serious now, And must betake me once more to my bantering, Telling a tale, according to my vow, In brisk ottava rima, freely sauntering After sweet speculations, high and low; Or, if I may, in a fine frenzy cantering On reinless Pegasus, athwart whose saddle, So many Gilpins have now got a straddle. SAMUEL DEANE. THE POPULOUS VILLAGE. There was a time, and that within the span Of the brief memory of short-lived man, When, close confined along the Atlantic seas, The timid settler heard the western breeze, And shrunk, expectant of the savage dart, Or whizzing arrow, at his beating heart. The western Mountains stood in awful forms, Like clouds surcharged with tempest, fire and storms, Whence the red bolt of rapid death might fly, And whirlwinds rend the ocean and the sky; For there did lurk the white-man's deadliest foe, Gathering to burst upon the vales below. A solemn race—a dark relentless clan, That own'd no ties of blood with civil man; A fearful foe—combining human art, The wiles of serpents, and the tiger's heart: Their sternest joy to daunt and scourge a race, Soften'd by love—refined by Christian grace; In tangled dells, where not heaven's light had shined, They held their home—apt emblem of their mind. Here many a beauteous stream majestic pours, From distant mountains, to the ocean shores, And in their course, enrich the earth in vain— All unexplored, or hill, or vale, or plain, And he was passing bold, who dared advance Up toward their source, or e'en a thought to glance. The soil was held by unresisted might, The tiger's and the wolf's prescriptive right; Nay e'en more awful images might wake— Thick swarming skiffs along the stream and lake, With desp'rate skill against the rapids glide, Or down the cataract's tumultuous tide; And hark! the warwhoop o'er the valley floats;— The wolf's wild howls are music's softest notes. But light at length prevails; darkness retreats, To fix, in distant dens, her gloomy seats: Improving nature, at this long delay Indignant, from her barriers bursts away, Shakes off the savage forms, by which oppress'd She languish'd long, and with new charms is dress'd. The dark, cold tribes, less boldly urge the strife, And melt before the light of civil life: And gathering courage now, the heroic swain Pursues them far toward the western main; Nor yet the flight, nor the pursuit gives o'er, Until their strength and terrors are no more: Then turns to peaceful homes, and brightning plains, Where life to long-protracted age remains. The yeomen still survive, whose eye can trace Successive changes on our country's face: Where forests frown'd, are shining cities seen, And fields with Eden's bounty smile serene: And many a soldier lives to tell the tales Of deadly strife, 'mid yonder hills and vales; Can point the spot where raging battle stood, The very turf that drank his father's blood; Can show the lake or stream where brothers bled, Whose bones, scarce whiten'd, pave their lowly bed. Perhaps some hero lives, who led the brave, To freedom's boon, or honor's hallow'd grave; His locks scarce changed—scarce lost their raven hue Still firm in strength—in thought and memory true; Come fancy! come! the image fair portray Of some firm vet'ran, bending back his way To yonder fields, the arena of his strife, For home and country, liberty and life. Bright in his memory is the open glade, Remotest trace that industry had made; And fresh the image of the forest fierce, Deep tangled, not meridian suns could pierce, Where the grim savage, turning from his prey, Slunk, like the wolf, and shunn'd the face of day. Onward the veteran moves; but where 's that lawn, Once the last line that civil man had drawn? And where that wild wood rising dark and high, Like strong embattled fortress to the sky? Lo! other fields in endless prospect rise, And like the horizon, still the forest flies. Yet sure 't was here opposing armies stood; That is the stream that redden'd with his blood; It was from thence the wild man's warwhoop rose, And here he stemm'd the onset of the foes; But lo! the plain, hill, valley, all around, With the bright Populous Village now are crown'd There, where the Indian often earth'd the wolf, Along the brink of yonder tumbling gulph, The rocks have yielded to the workman's hand, And there in splendid palaces they stand. Where the brisk waterfall, whose music found No ear but echo once, to catch the sound, Now, all its aid to human arts applied, Prepares our food, and dress, and wealth beside: See wheels on wheels, in mystic motion there! The rattling engines of Minerva's care. On yonder well-remember'd rising ground, Where tallest firs with deepest shadows frown'd, There now the noble Church sends up her spire, To catch day's latest, and his earliest fire. There, where the solitary wigwam stood, Uncouthly form'd of stakes and leaves and mud, Whose door stood wide, because it could not close, To welcome weary wild men to repose; Or 'mid the clouds of smoke and filth, to share The half-seeth'd members of the savage bear; There now the stately Inn, a spacious seat, Invites the weary to refined retreat. Around where ignorance had taken her stand, With reign primeval, o'er the darken'd land, See learning's nurseries at every turn, Where every urchin finds the means to learn; And onward, see the high school's spacious halls, And onward, still, the prouder college walls. Here bustling trade is laden with his bales; There commerce spreads her wings, unfolds her sails; Here on canals, deep freighted barges toil; There groaning wains with products of the soil; The thronging streets what busy numbers fill! What tides of passengers roll onward still! Not fled from want, but drawn by interest's bond, To visit peopled regions far beyond. There, where the guard-house frown'd upon yon height, And weary sentinels wore out the night With painful vigils, on their loaded arms, To save the sleeping hamlet from alarms; There now the green-house, shaded with the vine, And summer flowers, with evergreens entwine. The terrors of the wilderness are fled, And Niagara's thunders lose their dread; Down its deep chasm, no hazard of his life, Goes the soft cit, and e'en his softer wife. And Huron's shadowy shore lights up its brow, And wild Oswego does but tinkle now, Whose very name but sounded, once would dart A nervous terror through a foreign heart. All these are fled, and peace and plenty reign O'er rising town and cultivated plain. Now to the decent church our thoughts return, Whither our willing feet have often borne, When solemn themes moved our vibrating strings, And hope was pregnant with immortal things. 'Tis not alone, that village prospects round, Are fill'd and finish'd by that spire—and crown'd 'T is not alone the evidence that prayer, And meek devotion, do not languish there; A thousand prouder monuments may stand Of wrested tithes from patient labor's hand; Yet, with abated pleasure, freemen see The loftiest piles, where not the heart is free; 'T is this that clothes thy fabric with its charms— The free-will offering—shed from bounty's arms. In gilded domes proud prelates may be found, To cheat the hungry soul, with unknown sound; But nought can win us, or delights impart, Save truth's free breast, and language of the heart In native dignity, thy preacher stands, More than the dignity of robes and bands; Nor needs a surplice to convince your mind His head can teach, his life can lead mankind: Nor seeks a sacred office he, to hide An infidel's false heart, or worldling's pride; Nor shows the crackling flames of fiery zeal, The bigot's selfish feelings to conceal. On superstition's aid he rests no claim, To wake devotion, or increase its flame; One word of wisdom awes with truer grace Than Endor's dame, with all her sickly race. No prude, to rail at fashions of the times, And pick at peccadilloes—while the crimes That strike within, and deepest stains impart, And damn the soul, scarce shock his tender heart; No tyrant he, to rule the church with fear, Nor lean upon her strength, to domineer: When meek persuasion's force is fruitless seen, His duty is discharged, his hands are clean. His form and mien no sensualist betray, Whose body o'er his soul usurps the sway; Whose fair, smooth brow, and florid cheek declare, No cure of souls, no love of learning there; But comely paleness, decent leanness, shew The scholar's patience, and the pastor's too— To him philosophy's best light has shined, Not to bewilder and mislead his mind, Not his warm love to chill, or to recall From that High King “who ruleth over all,” Nor plunge in Nature's causes, and refine, To miss the traces of the hand Divine; To push him on to doubt, and dark despair, To feed his lambs with nature's stinted fare; Though wise in nature, he on grace relies, To lead his flock, and win them to the skies. But see! above, and onward, and around, What scenes of village pleasure still abound! The open hill, the wood beyond the glade, The broken chasm the trickling brook has made; There youth and age, and friends and lovers stray, When o'er the scene the earliest zephyrs play. The seats of living rock, the shady bower, For summer's noon, or evening's balmy hour; The boughs of Autumn, with their fruits o'erborne; The golden promise of the ripening corn; The thousand pleasures that relieve the night, When winter suns too soon withdraw their light; The youthful bands, with rural relish still, Glide like the arrow down the ice-clad hill; Their graver sires, who deeper interests feel, In councils sitting, on the public weal; The assembly's hall, where polish'd wit beguiles, Or festive innocence presides and smiles; The long processions o'er the frozen lakes, And the light joy that winter's music wakes. How have we seen the purest of delight Kindle and spread on many a bridal night! Amidst the gay-dress'd group, the happy pair, Smiled on by eager swain, and blushing fair; The bridegroom, joyful that this day has come— The bride still press'd with lingering thoughts of home— Parental cares, so oft foreboding ill— Parental hope, that bids those fears be still; E'en wrinkled brows with smiles unwonted shine, As in the sports of youth the grandsires join; The reverend pastor, fondly bent to call Heaven's choicest blessings on his children all; His hand not much conversant with the gold, That children of this world intensely hold; Pardon'd the more, if now his heart might be Some trifle lighter for the marriage fee. SAMUEL GILMAN. HISTORY OF A RAY OF LIGHT. “Let there be light!” creation's Author spoke, And quick from chaos floods of splendor broke— On that magnificent, primeval morn, Myself, an humble ray of light was born. Vain were the task to guess my native place; Rushing, careering, furiously through space, Plunged amid kindred rays and mingling beams, These are my first of recollection's gleams. Oh! with what joy we rioted along! Darting afar, in young existence strong, Onward we poured the unaccustomed day Through tracts, the length of many a milky way. (For know, we rays of light are living things, Each with ten thousand pair of brilliant wings; No wonder then, when all those wings are stirr'd, We flit it so much faster than a bird.) At last, when youthful years and sports were done, Choice, chance, or duty brought me to your sun; And, while my brother pencils fled afar, To swell the glories of some viewless star, 'T was mine to fly about this work of heav'n, Where one huge orb gave light and heat to seven, Although short visits now and then I make, To distant spheres, for recreation's sake. Ah! ne'er shall I forget th' eventful day When to this planet first I sped my way: To many a twinkling throb my heart gave birth, As near and nearer I approach'd the earth. What was to be my fate? for ever lost In some dark bog? or was I to be tost In wild reflection, round some narrow spot, Then sink absorb'd, inglorious and forgot? No, reader, no—far different the career Which fate designed me to accomplish here: Millions of splendid scenes 't was mine to grace, Though my first act brought ruin to your race. Trembling, I reach'd the serpent's glistening eye, Then glanced, and struck the apple, hanging by, Then, to your mother Eve reflected, flew, And thus, at one exploit, a world o'erthrew! Oh scene of wo! the mischief I had wrought, Those quick successive shocks, that stunn'd my thought, The poisonous magic from that sire of lies, The worse contagion in that woman's eyes, All were too much for one poor ray of light, New to his task, and meaning only right. Distrest in heart, at once myself I hurl'd Far to the outside of this injured world, Wishing to wear my wretched life away, 'Mid scenes, where solitude and chaos lay. At length, while wandering o'er these realms of wo, I heard a small, sweet voice that whisper'd low In tones of soothing—'t was a brother ray Sent from the hand that first created day— “No longer mourn,” the darting angel said, “The hopes of man are not for ever fled From his own race a Saviour shall arise, To lead him back to his forbidden skies; And hark! when Bethl'em's beauteous star shall shine, Its first and freshest radiance shall be thine!” Cheer'd by these words, I long'd to gain once more This lovely world, and try my fortune o'er. Just then a globe, new struck from chaos out, Met me, and turn'd my headlong path about; Back to the sun with breathless speed I flew, And thence rush'd down, where bright to Noah's view The glorious rainbow shone—a lingering stop I made within a small pellucid drop, Touch'd its internal surface, and outright Darted through air to glad the patriarch's sight. Glancing from thence away, I sported on Where'er by pleasure or by duty drawn;— Now tipping some bright drop of pearly dew, Now plunging into heaven through tracks of blue, Now aiding to light up the glorious morn, Or twilight's softer mantle to adorn, Now darting through the depths of ocean clear, To paint a pearl—then to the atmosphere Again reflected, shooting to the skies Away, away, where thought can never rise; Then trav'ling down to tinge some valley flower, Or point some beauty's eye with mightier power, Or to some monarch's gem new lustre bring, Or light with fire some prouder insect's wing, Or lend to health's red cheek a brighter dye, Or flash delusive from consumption's eye, Or sparkle round a vessel's form by night, Or give the glow-worm its phosphoric light, Or clothe with terror threatening anger's glance, Or from beneath the lids of love to dance, Or place those little silver points on tears, Or light devotion's eye, while mercy hears; In short, to aid with my poor transient flings, All scenes, all passions, all created things. Few rays of light have been where I have been, Honor'd like me, or seen what I have seen: I glow'd amid the bush, which Moses saw, I lit the mount, when he proclaim'd his law: I to that blazing pillar brought my mite, Which glared along old Israel's path by night. I lent a glory to Elijah's car, And took my promised flight from Bethl'em's star. But not to holy ground was I confined, In classic haunts my duties were assign'd. I primed the bolts Olympian Jove would throw, And Pluto sought me for his fires below: Over and over gallant Phœbus swore, I was the finest dart his quiver bore: Oft was I sent a peeping, anxious ray From Dian, hastening where Endymion lay: When Iris shot from heaven, all swift and bright, Thither I rush'd, companion of her flight: From Vulcan's anvil I was made to glare, I lent a horror to the Gorgon's stare, I too have beam'd upon Achilles' shield, And dropp'd from Helen's eye when Paris kneel'd; Faithful Achates, every school-boy knows, Struck from a flint my whole long year's repose: Ten wretched days I pass'd in sobs and sighs, Because I could not dance on Homer's eyes: I once was decomposed from that pure oil, Which cheer'd the Athenian sage's midnight toil: I from the brazen focus led the van, When Archimedes tried his frightful plan; 'T was I, from Cleopatra's orb that hurl'd The fatal glance, which lost her slave the world: I struck the sweetest notes on Memnon's lyre, And quiver'd on the phœnix' funeral pyre. Nor ancient scenes alone engross'd my pranks, The moderns likewise owe me many thanks. Straight in at Raphael's skylight once I broke, And led his pencil to its happiest stroke; I sparkled on the cross Belinda wore, And tipp'd the Peri's wing of Thomas Moore; To Fontenelle I glided from above, When whispering soft astronomy and love; And know, where'er the finest bards have sung The moon's sweet praises with bewitching tongue, Or that blue evening star of mellow light, 'T was always after I had touch'd their sight. Nor yet have poetry and painting shared My sole regards—for science I have cared. When Galileo raised his glass on high, Me first it brought to his astonish'd eye; When Newton's prism loosed the solar beams, I help'd to realize his heaven-taught dreams; When Herschel his dim namesake first descried, I was justshooting from that planet's side. At all eclipses and conjunctions nigh, Of sun, or satellite, or primary, Oft have I serv'd the longtitude to fix— And heavens! in June of eighteen hundred six, How all New England smiled to see me burst, Out from behind her darken'd sun the first! I form'd a spangle on the modest robes Of Doctor Olbers' new-discover'd globes; I from the comet's path was downward sent, When Bowditch seized me for an element: Once trav'ling from a fourth-rate star to earth, I gave the hint of abberration birth. I led th' electric flash to Priestley's sight, And play'd my sports round Franklin's daring kite; Absorb'd in copper once I long had lain, When lo! Galvani gave me life again. I taught the Swede that after sunny days, Lilies and marigolds will dart forth rays; And when polarity made Savans stare For the first time, be sure that I was there. When iron first in oxygen was burnt, When Davy his metallic basis learnt, When Brewster shaped his toy for peeping eyes, And Humboldt counted stars in southern skies, 'T was I that moved, while bursting on their sigh The flush of wonder, triumph, and delight. Nor scarce does history boast one splendid scene Or deep-mark'd era, where I have not been. The sky-hung cross of Constantine, which turn'd All Rome to truth, by my assistance burn'd; When the great charter England's rights restored, I scared her monarch from a baron's sword; When pious Europe led the far crusade, Did I not flash from Godfrey's wielded blade? Did chivalry one tournament display Of dazzling pomp, from which I kept away? Was I not present at that gorgeous scene, Where Leicester entertained old England's queen? Did I not sparkle on the iron crown Which the triumphant Corsican took down? Did I not revel where those splendors shone, When the fourth George assumed Britannia's throne? And last, not least, could I refuse to hear, The summons of th' Atlantic Souvenir? No, gentlest reader, trust your humble ray, 'T is here at length I would for ever stay, If to and fro I could descend and rise 'Twixt these bright pages and your brighter eyes; Absorb'd, reflected, radiated, bent, With force emitted, or for ages pent, Through the wide world so long and often toss'd; Th' excursive passion of my youth I've lost. I wish no more in my six thousandth year, Than just to take my peaceful mansion here, To deck these limnings with my happiest art, And 'mid these leaves to play my brightest part.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. III. RICHARD H. DANA THE BUCCANEER. The island lies nine leagues away. Along its solitary shore, Of craggy rock and sandy bay, No sound but ocean's roar, Save, where the bold, wild sea-bird makes her home Her shrill cry coming through the sparkling foam. But when the light winds lie at rest, And on the glassy, heaving sea, The black duck, with her glossy breast, Sits swinging silently; How beautiful! no ripples break the reach, And silvery waves go noiseless up the beach. And inland rests the green, warm dell; The brook comes tinkling down its side; From out the trees the sabbath bell Rings cheerful, far and wide, Mingling its sounds with bleatings of the flocks, That feed about the vale amongst the rocks. Nor holy bell, nor pastoral bleat In former days within the vale; Flapp'd in the bay the pirate's sheet; Curses were on the gale; Rich goods lay on the sand, and murder'd men; Pirate and wrecker kept their revels then. But calm, low voices, words of grace, Now slowly fall upon the ear; A quiet look is in each face, Subdued and holy fear: Each motion's gentle; all is kindly done— Come, listen, how from crime this isle was won. Twelve years are gone since Matthew Lee Held in this isle unquestion'd sway, A dark, low, brawny man was he— His law—“It is my way.” Beneath his thickset brows a sharp light broke From small gray eyes; his laugh a triumph spoke. Cruel of heart, and strong of arm, Loud in his sport, and keen for spoil, He little reck'd of good or harm, Fierce both in mirth and toil; Yet like a dog could fawn, if need there were; Speak mildly, when he would, or look in fear. Amidst the uproar of the storm, And by the lightning's sharp, red glare, Were seen Lee's face and sturdy form; His axe glanced quick in air. Whose corpse at morn is floating in the sedge? “There 's blood and hair, Matt, on thy axe's edge.” “Nay, ask him yonder; let him tell, I make the brute, not man, my mark. Who walks these cliffs, needs heed him well! Last night was fearful dark. Think ye the lashing waves will spare or feel! An ugly gash!—these rocks—they cut like steel.” He wiped his axe; and turning round, Said with a cold and harden'd smile, “The hemp is saved—the man is drown'd. Wilt let him float awhile, Or give him christian burial on the strand? He'll find his fellows peaceful 'neath the sand.” Lee's waste was greater than his gain. “I'll try the merchant's trade,” he thought. “The trouble's less to kill, than feign; Things sweeter robb'd than bought. But, yet, to circumvent them at their arts!” Mann'd, and his spoils and cargo—Lee departs. 'T is fearful, on the broad-back'd waves, To feel them shake, and hear them roar:— Beneath, unsounded, dreadful caves— Around, no cheerful shore. Yet 'midst this solemn world what deeds are done! The curse goes up, the deadly sea-fight's won,— And wanton talk and laughter heard, Where speaks God's deep and awful voice. Look on that lonely ocean bird! Pray ye, when ye rejoice! “Leave prayers to priests,” cries Lee: “I'm ruler here! These fellows know full well whom they 're to fear!” The ship works hard; the seas run high; Their white tops flashing through the night, Give to the eager, straining eye, A wild and shifting light. “Hard at the pumps!—The leak is gaining fast!— Lighten the ship!—The devil rode that blast!” Ocean has swallow'd for its food Spoils thou didst gain in murderous glee; Matt, could its waters wash out blood, It had been well for thee. Crime fits for crime. And no repentant tear Hast thou for sin?—Then wait thine hour of fear. The sea has like a plaything toss'd That heavy hull the livelong night. The man of sin—he is not lost: Soft breaks the morning light. Torn spars and sail,—her cargo in the deep— The ship makes port with slow and laboring sweep. Within a Spanish port she rides. Angry and sour'd, Lee walks her deck. “Then peaceful trade a curse betides?— And thou, good ship, a wreck! Ill luck in change!—Ho! cheer ye up, my men! Rigg'd, and at sea, we'll to old work again!” A sound is in the Pyrenees! Whirling and dark, comes roaring down A tide, as of a thousand seas, Sweeping both cowl and crown. On field and vineyard thick and red it stood. Spain's streets and palaces are full of blood;— And wrath and terror shake the land; The peaks shine clear in watchfire lights; Soon comes the tread of that stout band— Bold Arthur and his knights. Awake ye, Merlin! Hear the shout from Spain! The spell is broke!—Arthur is come again!— Too late for thee, thou young, fair bride; The lips are cold, the brow is pale, That thou didst kiss in love and pride. He cannot hear thy wail, Whom thou didst lull with fondly murmur'd sound— His couch is cold and lonely in the ground. He fell for Spain—her Spain no more; For he was gone who made it dear; And she would seek some distant shore, At rest from strife and fear, And wait amidst her sorrows till the day, His voice of love should call her thence away. Lee feign'd him grieved, and bow'd him low. 'T would joy his heart could he but aid So good a lady in her wo, He meekly, smoothly said. With wealth and servants she is soon aboard, And that white steed she rode beside her lord. The sun goes down upon the sea; The shadows gather round her home. “How like a pall are ye to me! My home, how like a tomb! O! blow, ye flowers of Spain, above his head.— Ye will not blow o'er me when I am dead.” And now the stars are burning bright; Yet still she looks towards the shore Beyond the waters black in night. “I ne'er shall see thee more! Ye 're many, waves, yet lonely seems your flow, And I'm alone—scarce know I where I go.” Sleep, sleep, thou sad one, on the sea! The wash of waters lulls thee now; His arm no more will pillow thee, Thy hand upon his brow. He is not near, to hush thee, or to save. The ground is his—the sea must be thy grave. The moon comes up—the night goes on. Why in the shadow of the mast, Stands that dark, thoughtful man alone? Thy pledge, man; keep it fast! Bethink thee of her youth and sorrows, Lee: Helpless, alone—and, then, her trust in thee! When told the hardships thou hadst borne, Her words were to thee like a charm. With uncheer'd grief her heart is worn.— Thou wilt not do her harm! He looks out on the sea that sleeps in light, And growls an oath—“It is too still tonight! He sleeps; but dreams of massy gold, And heaps of pearl. He stretch'd his hands. He hears a voice—“Ill man, withhold.” A pale one near him stands; Her breath comes deathly cold upon his cheek; Her touch is cold. He wakes with piercing shriek. He wakes; but no relentings wake Within his angry, restless soul. “What, shall a dream Matt's purpose shake? The gold will make all whole. Thy merchant's trade has nigh unmann'd thee, lad! What, balk thy chance because a woman 's sad?” He cannot look on her mild eye— Her patient words his spirit quell. Within that evil heart there lie The hates and fears of hell. His speech is short; he wears a surly brow. There 's none will hear her shriek. What fear ye now? The workings of the soul ye fear; Ye fear the power that goodness hath; Ye fear the Unseen One, ever near, Walking his ocean path. From out the silent void there comes a cry— “Vengeance is mine! Lost man, thy doom is nigh!” Nor dread of ever-during wo, Nor the sea's awful solitude, Can make thee, wretch, thy crime forego. Then, bloody hand—to blood! The scud is driving wildly over head;— The stars burn dim; the ocean moans its dead. Moan for the living—moan our sins,— The wrath of man, more fierce than thine. Hark! still thy waves!—The work begins— He makes the deadly sign. The crew glide down like shadows. Eye and hand Speak fearful meanings through that silent band. They 're gone. The helmsman stands alone; And one leans idly o'er the bow. Still as a tomb the ship keeps on; Nor sound nor stirring now. Hush, hark! as from the centre of the deep— Shrieks—fiendish yells! they stab them in their sleep. The scream of rage, the groan, the strife, The blow, the gasp, the horrid cry, The panting, stifled prayer for life, The dying's heaving sigh, The murderer's curse, the dead man's fix'd, still glare, And fear's and death's cold sweat—they all are there! On pale, dead men, on burning cheek, On quick, fierce eyes, brows hot and damp, On hands that with the warm blood reek, Shines the dim cabin lamp. Lee look'd. “They sleep so sound,” he, laughing, said, “They'll scarcely wake for mistress or for maid.” A crash! They've forced the door,—and then One long, long, shrill, and piercing scream Comes thrilling through the growl of men. 'T is hers!—O God, redeem From worse than death thy suffering, helpless child! That dreadful cry again—sharp, sharp, and wild! It ceased.—with speed o' th' lightning's flash, A loose-robed form, with streaming hair, Shoots by.—A leap—a quick, short splash! 'T is gone!—There's nothing there! The waves have swept away the bubbling tide. Bright-crested waves, how proudly on ye ride! She 's sleeping in her silent cave, Nor hears the stern, loud roar above, Or strife of man on land or wave. Young thing! thy home of love Thou soon hast reach'd!—Fair, unpolluted thing! They harm'd thee not!—Was dying suffering? O, no!—To live when joy was dead; To go with one, lone, pining thought— To mournful love thy being wed— Feeling what death had wrought; To live the child of wo, yet shed no tear, Bear kindness, and yet share no joy nor fear; To look on man, and deem it strange That he on things of earth should brood, When all its throng'd and busy range To thee was solitude— O, this was bitterness!—Death came and prest Thy wearied lids, and brought thy sick heart rest. Why look ye on each other so, And speak no word?—Ay, shake the head! She 's gone where ye can never go. What fear ye from the dead? They tell no tales; and ye are all true men; But wash away that blood; then, home again!— 'T is on your souls; it will not out! Lee, why so lost? 'T is not like thee! Come, where 's thy revel, oath, and shout? —“That pale one in the sea!— I mind not blood.—But she—I cannot tell! A spirit was 't?—It flash'd like fires of hell!— “And when it pass'd there was no tread! It leapt on deck.—Who heard the sound? I heard none!—Say—what was it fled?— Poor girl!—And is she drown'd?— Went down these depths? How dark they look, and cold! She 's yonder! stop her!—Now!—there!—hold, man, hold!” They gazed upon his ghastly face. “What ails thee, Lee; and why that glare?” —“Look! ha, 'tis gone, and not a trace! No, no, she was not there! Who of you said ye heard her when she fell? 'T was strange!—I'll not be fool'd!—Will no one tell?” He paused. As soon the wildness past. Then came the tingling flush of shame. Remorse and fear are gone as fast. “The silly thing 's to blame To quit us so. 'T is plain she loved us not; Or she 'd have staid awhile, and shared my cot.” And then the ribald laugh'd. The jest, Though old and foul, loud laughter drew. And words more foul came from the rest Of that infernal crew. Note, heaven, their blasphemy, their broken trust! Lust panders murder—murder panders lust! Now slowly up they bring the dead From out that silent, dim-lit room. No prayer at their quick burial said— No friend to weep their doom. The hungry waves have seized them one by one; And, swallowing in their prey, go roaring on. Cries Lee, “We must not be betray'd. 'T is but to add another corse! Strange words, 't is said, an ass once bray'd. I'll never trust a horse! We'll throw him on the waves alive! He'll swim; For once a horse shall ride—we all ride him.” Such sound to mortal ear ne'er came As rang far o'er the waters wide. It shook with fear the stoutest frame— That horse is on the tide! As the waves leave, or lift him up, his cry Comes lower now—and, now, 't is near and high. And through the swift wave's yesty crown His scared eyes shoot a fiendish light, And fear seems wrath. He now sinks down, Now heaves again to sight, Then drifts away; yet all that night they hear Far off that dreadful cry.—But morn is near. O, hadst thou known what deeds were done, When thou wast shining far away, Wouldst thou let fall, calm-coming sun, Thy warm and silent ray? The good are in their graves; thou canst not cheer Their dark, cold mansions. Sin alone is here. “The deed 's complete! The gold is ours! There, wash away that bloody stain! Pray who'd refuse what fortune showers? Now, lads, we'll lot our gain. Must fairly share, you know, what's fairly got! A truly good night's work! Who'll say 't was not?” There 's song, and oath, and gaming deep— Hot words, and laughter—mad carouse: There 's nought of prayer, and little sleep. The devil keeps the house! “Lee cheats!” cried Jack.—Lee struck him to the heart. “That's foul!” one mutter'd.—“Fool! you take your part!— “The fewer heirs the richer, man! Hold forth thy palm, and keep thy prate! Our life, we read, is but a span. What matters, soon or late? Death comes!”—On shore, and ask'd how many died? “That sickness swept near half,” said Lee, and sigh'd. Within our bay, one stormy night, The isle's men saw boats make for shore, With here and there a dancing light That flash'd on man and oar. When hail'd, the rowing stopt, and all was dark. “Ha! lantern work!—We'll home!—They're playing shark!” Next day, at noon, towards the town, All stared and wonder'd much to see, Matt and his men come strolling down. The boys shout, “Here comes Lee!” “Thy ship, good Lee?” “Not many leagues from shore Our ship by chance took fire.”—They learnt no more. He and his crew were flush of gold. “You did not lose your cargo, then?” —“Learn where all 's fairly bought and sold, Heaven prospers those true men. Forsake your evil ways, as we forsook Our ways of sin, and honest courses took! “Wouldst see my log-book? fairly writ, With pen of steel, and ink like blood! —How lightly doth the conscience sit! Learn, truth's the only good.” And thus, with flout, and cold and impious jeer, He fled repentance, if he 'scaped not fear. Remorse and fear he drowns in drink. “Come, pass the bowl, my jolly crew! It thicks the blood to mope and think. —Here 's merry days, though few!” And then he quaffs.—So riot reigns within; So brawl and laughter shake that house of sin. Matt lords it now throughout the isle. His hand falls heavier than before. All dread alike his frown or smile. None come within his door, Save those who dipp'd their hands in blood with him; Save those who laugh'd to see the white horse swim. “To night 's our anniversary; And, mind me, lads, we'll have it kept With royal state and special glee! Better with those who slept Their sleep that night, had he be now, who slinks! And health and wealth to him who bravely drinks!” The words they spoke, we may not speak. The tales they told, we may not tell. Mere mortal man, forbear to seek The secrets of that hell! Their shouts grow loud. 'T is near mid hour of night. What means upon the water that red light? Not bigger than a star it seems: And, now, t is like the bloody moon: And, now, it shoots in hairy streams Its light!—'T will reach us soon! A ship! and all on fire!—hull, yards and mast! Her sheets are sheets of flame!—She 's nearing fast! And now she rides, upright and still, Shedding a wild and lurid light Around the cove, on inland hill, Waking the gloom of night. All breathes of terror! Men in dumb amaze Gaze on each other 'neath the horrid blaze. It scares the sea-birds from their nests. They dart and wheel with deaf'ning screams; Now dark,—and now their wings and breasts Flash back disastrous gleams. O, sin, what hast thou done on this fair earth? The world, O man, is wailing o er thy birth. And what comes up above that wave, So ghastly white?—a spectral head!— A horse's head!—(May heaven save Those looking on the dead,— The waking dead!) There on the sea he stands— The spectre-horse!—He moves; he gains the sands! Onward he speeds. His ghostly sides Are streaming with a cold, blue light. Heaven keep the wits of him who rides The spectre-horse tonight! His path is shining like a swift ship's wake; He gleams before Lee's door like day's gray break. The revel now is high within; It breaks upon the midnight air. They little think, 'midst mirth and din, What spirit waits them there. As if the sky became a voice, there spread A sound to appal the living, stir the dead. The spirit-steed sent up the neigh. It seem'd the living trump of hell, Sounding to call the damn'd away, To join the host that fell. It rang along the vaulted sky: the shore Jarr'd hard, as when the thronging surges roar. It rang in ears that knew the sound; And hot, flush'd cheeks are blanch'd with fear. And why does Lee look wildly round? Thinks he the drown'd horse near? He drops his cup—his lips are stiff with fright. Nay, sit thee down!—It is thy banquet night. “I cannot sit. I needs must go: The spell is on my spirit now. I go to dread—I go to wo!” O, who so weak as thou, Strong man!—His hoofs upon the door-stone, see, The shadow stands!—His eyes are on thee, Lee!— Thy hair pricks up!—“O, I must bear His damp, cold breath! It chills my frame! His eyes—their near and dreadful glare Speak that I must not name!” Thou 'rt mad to mount that horse!—“A power within, I must obey—cries, ‘mount thee, man of sin!’” He 's now astride the spectre's back, With rein of silk, and curb of gold. 'T is fearful speed!—the rein is slack Within his senseless hold: Nor doth he touch the shade he strides—upborne By an unseen power.—God help thee, man forlorn! He goes with speed: he goes with dread! And now they 're on the hanging steep! And, now! the living and the dead, They'll make the horrid leap! The horse stops short:—his feet are on the verge. He stands, like marble, high above the surge. And, nigh, the tall ship yet burns on, With red, hot spars and crackling flame. From hull to gallant, nothing 's gone. She burns, and yet 's the same! Her hot, red flame is beating, all the night, On man and horse, in their cold, phosphor light. Through that cold light the fearful man Sits looking on the burning ship. Thou ne'er again wilt curse and ban. How fast he moves the lip! And yet he does not speak, or make a sound! What see you, Lee,—the bodies of the drown'd? “I look, where mortal man may not— Into the chambers of the deep. I see the dead, long, long forgot— I see them in their sleep. A dreadful power is mine, which none can know, Save he who leagues his soul with death and wo.” Thou mild, sad mother—waning moon, Thy last, low, melancholy ray Shines toward him.—Quit him not so soon! Mother, in mercy, stay! Despair and death are with him; and canst thou, With that kind, earthward look, go leave him now? O, thou wast born for things of love; Making more lovely in thy shine Whate'er thou look'st on. Hosts above, In that soft light of thine, Burn softer:—earth, in silvery veil, seems heaven.— Thou 'rt going down!—Thou 'st left him unforgiven! The far, low west is bright no more. How still it is! No sound is heard At sea, or all along the shore, But cry of passing bird. Thou living thing,—and dar'st thou come so near These wild and ghastly shapes of death and fear? Now long that thick, red light has shone On stern, dark rocks, and deep, still bay, On man and horse that seem of stone, So motionless are they. But now its lurid fire less fiercely burns: The night is going—faint, gray dawn returns. That spectre-steed now slowly pales; Now changes like the moonlit cloud. That cold, thin light, now slowly fails, Which wrapt them like a shroud. Both ship and horse are fading into air.— Lost, mazed, alone, see, Lee is standing there! The morning air blows fresh on him; The waves dance gladly in his sight; The sea-birds call, and wheel, and skim— O, blessed morning light! He doth not hear that joyous call; he sees No beauty in the wave; he feels no breeze. For he 's accurst from all that 's good; He ne'er must know his healing power. The sinner on his sins must brood; Must wait, alone, his hour. Thou stranger to earth's beauty—human love, There 's here no rest for thee, no hope above! The hot sun beats upon his head. He stands beneath its broad, fierce blaze, As stiff and cold as one that 's dead: A troubled, dreamy maze Of some unearthly horror, all he knows— Of some wild horror past, and coming woes. The gull has found her place on shore; The sun 's gone down unto his rest; All 's still but ocean's weary roar— There stands the man unblest. But, see, he moves—he turns, as asking where His mates!—Why looks he with that piteous stare? Go, get thee home, and end thy mirth! Go, call the revellers again! They 've fled the isle; and o'er the earth Are wanderers, like Cain. As he his door-stone past, the air blew chill. The wine is on the board; Lee, take thy fill! “There 's none to meet me, none to cheer: The seats are empty—lights burnt out; And I alone, must sit me here: Would I could hear their shout!” Thou ne'er shalt hear it more—more taste thy wine!— Silent thou sitt'st within the still moonshine. Day came again; and up he rose, A weary man, from his lone board. Nor merry feast, nor sweet repose Did that long night afford. No shadowy-coming night, to bring him rest— No dawn, to chase the darkness of his breast! He walks within the day's full glare A darken'd man. Where'er he comes, All shun him. Children peep and stare; Then, frighted, seek their homes. Through all the crowd a thrilling horror ran. They point and say—“There goes the evil man!” He turns and curses in his wrath Both man and child; then hastes away Shoreward, or takes some gloomy path; But there he cannot stay: Terror and madness drive him back to men; His hate of man to solitude again. Time passes on, and he grows bold— His eye more fierce, his oaths more loud. None dare from Lee the hand withhold; He rules and scoffs the crowd. But still at heart there lies a secret fear; For now the year's dread round is drawing near. He swears; but he is sick at heart; He laughs; but he turns deadly pale. His restless eye and sudden start— These tell the dreadful tale That will be told: it needs no words from thee, Thou self-sold slave to fear and misery. Bond-slave of sin, see there—that light! “Ha! take me—take me from its blaze!” Nay, thou must ride the steed tonight! But many weary days And nights will shine and darken o'er thy head, Ere thou wilt go with him to meet the dead. Again the ship lights all the land; Again Lee strides the spectre-beast; Again upon the cliff they stand— This once thou'lt be released!— Gone horse and ship; but Lee's last hope is o'er; Nor laugh, nor scoff, nor rage, can help him more. His spirit heard that spirit say, “Listen!—I twice have come to thee. Once more—and then a dreadful way! And thou must go with me!” Ay, cling to earth as sailor to the rock! Sea-swept, suck'd down in the tremendous shock, He goes!—So thou must loose thy hold, And go with death; nor breathe the balm Of early air, nor light behold, Nor sit thee in the calm Of gentle thoughts, where good men wait their close.— In life, or death, where look'st thou for repose? Who 's yonder on that long, black ledge, Which makes so far into the sea? See! there he sits, and pulls the sedge— Poor, idle Matthew Lee! So weak and pale? A year and little more, And thou didst lord it bravely round this shore. And on the shingles now he sits, And rolls the pebbles 'neath his hands; Now walks the beach; then stops by fits, And scores the smooth, wet sands; Then tries each cliff, and cove, and jut, that bounds The isle; then home from many weary rounds. They ask him why he wanders so, From day to day, the uneven strand? —“I wish, I wish that I might go! But I would go by land; And there 's no way that I can find—I've tried All day and night!”—He look'd towards sea and sigh'd. It brought the tear to many an eye, That, once, his eye had made to quail. “Lee, go with us; our sloop rides nigh; Come! help us hoist her sail.” He shook.—“You know the spirit-horse I ride! He'll let me on the sea with none beside!” He views the ships that come and go, Looking so like to living things. O! 't is a proud and gallant show Of bright and broad spread wings Flinging a glory round them, as they keep Their course right onward through the unsounded deep. And where the far-off sand-bars lift Their backs in long and narrow line, The breakers shout, and leap, and shift, And send the sparkling brine Into the air; then rush to mimic strife:— Glad creatures of the sea! How all seems life!— But not to Lee. He sits alone; No fellowship nor joy for him. Borne down by wo, he makes no moan, Though tears will sometimes dim That asking eye.—O, how his worn thoughts crave— Not joy again, but rest within the grave. The rocks are dripping in the mist That lies so heavy off the shore. Scarce seen the running breakers;—list Their dull and smother'd roar! Lee hearkens to their voice.—“I hear, I hear You call.—Not yet!—I know my time is near!” And now the mist seems taking shape, Forming a dim, gigantic ghost,— Enormous thing!—There 's no escape; 'T is close upon the coast. Lee kneels, but cannot pray.—Why mock him so? The ship has clear'd the fog, Lee, see her go! A sweet, low voice, in starry nights, Chants to his ear a plaining song. Its tones come winding up those heights, Telling of wo and wrong; And he must listen till the stars grow dim, The song that gentle voice doth sing to him. O, it is sad that aught so mild Should bind the soul with bands of fear; That strains to soothe a little child, The man should dread to hear! But sin hath broke the world's sweet peace—unstrung The harmonious chords to which the angels sung. In thick, dark nights he 'd take his seat High up the cliffs, and feel them shake, As swung the sea with heavy beat Below—and hear it break With savage roar, then pause and gather strength, And then, come tumbling in its swollen length. But thou no more shalt haunt the beach, Nor sit upon the tall cliff's crown, Nor go the round of all that reach, Nor feebly sit thee down, Watching the swaying weeds:—another day, And thou 'lt have gone far hence that dreadful way. To night the charmed number 's told. “Twice have I come for thee,” it said. “Once more, and none shall thee behold. Come! live one, to the dead!”— So hears his soul, and fears the coming night; Yet sick and weary of the soft, calm light. Again he sits within that room; All day he leans at that still board; None to bring comfort to his gloom, Or speak a friendly word. Weaken'd with fear, lone, haunted by remorse, Poor, shatter'd wretch, there waits he that pale horse. Not long he'll wait.—Where now are gone Peak, citadel, and tower, that stood Beautiful, while the west sun shone, And bathed them in his flood Of airy glory?—Sudden darkness fell; And down they sank, peak, tower, and citadel. The darkness, like a dome of stone, Ceils up the heavens.—'T is hush as death— All but the ocean's dull, low moan. How hard Lee draws his breath! He shudders as he feels the working Power. Arouse thee, Lee! up! man thee for thine hour!— 'T is close at hand: for there, once more, The burning ship. Wide sheets of flame And shafted fire she show'd before; Twice thus she hither came;— But now she rolls a naked hulk, and throws A wasting light; then, settling, down she goes. And where she sank, up slowly came The Spectre-Horse from out the sea. And there he stands! His pale sides flame. He'll meet thee shortly, Lee. He treads the waters as a solid floor: He 's moving on. Lee waits him at the door. They 've met.—“I know thou com'st for me,” Lee's spirit to the spectre said— “I know that I must go with thee— Take me not to the dead. It was not I alone that did the deed!” Dreadful the eye of that still, spectral steed! Lee cannot turn. There is a force In that fix'd eye, which holds him fast. How still they stand!—that man and horse. —Thine hour is almost past.” “O, spare me,” cries the wretch, “thou fearful one!” —“My time is full—I must not go alone.” “I'm weak and faint. O, let me stay!” —“Nay, murderer, rest nor stay for thee!” The horse and man are on their way; He bears him to the sea. Hark! how the spectre breathes through this still night! See, from his nostrils streams a deathly light! He 's on the beach; but stops not there. He 's on the sea!—Lee, quit the horse! Lee struggles hard.—'T is mad despair!— 'T is vain! The spirit-corse Holds him by fearful spell;—he cannot leap. Within that horrid light he rides the deep. It lights the sea around their track— The curling comb, and dark steel wave: There, yet, sits Lee the spectre's back— Gone! gone! and none to save! They 're seen no more; the night has shut them in. May heaven have pity on thee, man of sin! The earth has wash'd away its stain. The seal'd-up sky is breaking forth, Mustering its glorious hosts again From the far south and north. The climbing moon plays on the rippling sea. —O, whither on its waters rideth Lee? JAMES GATES PERCIVAL. [Pleasures of Childhood] “A thousand wildering reveries led astray My better reason, and my unguarded soul Danced like a feather on the turbid sea Of its own wild and freakish phantasies. At times, the historic page would catch my eye, And rivet down my thoughts on ancient times, And mix them with the demigods of old. How I loved To ascend the pyramids, and in their womb Gaze on the royal cenotaph, to sit Beneath thy ruin'd palaces and fanes, Balbec or princely Tadmor, though the one Lurk like a hermit in the lonely vales Of Lebanon, and the waste wilderness Embrace the other. Along the stream, That flow'd in summer's mildness o'er its bed Of rounded pebbles, with its scanty wave Encircling many an islet, and its banks In bays and havens scooping, I would stray, And dreaming, rear an empire on its shores. Where cities rose, and palaces and towers Caught the first light of morning, there the fleet Lent all its snowy canvas to the wind, And bore with awful front against the foe. There many a childish hour was spent; the world That moved and fretted round me, had no power To draw me from my musings, but the dream Enthrall'd me till it seem'd reality; And when I woke, I wonder'd that a brook Was babbling by, and a few rods of soil, Cover'd with scanty herbs, the arena where Cities and empires, fleets and armies rose.” NIGHT WATCHING. She sat beside her lover, and her hand Rested upon his clay-cold forehead. Death Was calmly stealing o'er him, and his life Went out by silent flickerings, when his eye Woke up from its dim lethargy, and cast Bright looks of fondness on her. He was weak, Too weak to utter all his heart. His eye Was now his only language, and it spake How much he felt her kindness, and the love That sat, when all had fled, beside him. Night Was far upon its watches, and the voice Of nature had no sound. The pure blue sky Was fair and lovely, and the many stars Look'd down in tranquil beauty on an earth That smiled in sweetest summer. She look'd out Through the raised window, and the sheeted bay Lay in a quiet sleep below, and shone With the pale beam of midnight—air was still, And the white sail, that o'er the distant stream Moved with so slow a pace, it seem'd at rest, Fix'd in the glassy water, and with care Shunn'd the dark den of pestilence, and stole Fearfully from the tainted gale that breathed Softly along the crisping wave—that sail Hung loosely on its yard, and as it flapp'd, Caught moving undulations from the light, That silently came down, and gave the hills, And spires, and walls, and roofs, a tint so pale, Death seem'd on all the landscape—but so still, Who would have thought that anything but peace And beauty had a dwelling there! The world Had gone, and life was not within those walls, Only a few, who linger'd faintly on, Waiting the moment of departure; or Sat tending at their pillows, with a love So strong it master'd fear—and they were few, And she was one—and in a lonely house, Far from all sight and sound of living thing, She watched the couch of him she loved, and drew Contagion from the lips that were to her Still beautiful as roses, though so pale They seem'd like a thin snow-curl. All was still, And even so deeply hush'd, the low, faint breath That trembling gasp'd away, came through the night As a loud sound of awe. She pass'd her hand Over those quivering lips, that ever grew Paler and colder, as the only sign To tell her life still linger'd—it went out! And her heart sank within her, when the last Weak sigh of life was over, and the room Seem'd like a vaulted sepulchre, so lone She dared not look around: and the light wind, That play'd among the leaves and flowers that grew Still freshly at her window, and waved back The curtain with a rustling sound, to her, In her intense abstraction, seem'd the voice Of a departed spirit. Then she heard, At least in fancy heard, a whisper breathe Close at her ear, and tell her all was done, And her fond loves were ended. She had watch'd Until her love grew manly, and she check'd The tears that came to flow, and nerved her heart To the last solemn duty. With a hand That trembled not, she closed the fallen lid, And press'd the lips, and gave them one long kiss— Then decently spread over all a shroud; And sitting with a look of lingering love Intense in tearless passion, rose at length, And pressing both her hands upon her brow, Gave loose to all her gushing grief in showers, Which, as a fountain seal'd till it had swell'd To its last fulness, now gave way and flow'd In a deep stream of sorrow. She grew calm, And parting back the curtains, look'd abroad Upon the moonlight loveliness, all sunk In one unbroken silence, save the moan From the lone room of death, or the dull sound Of the slow-moving hearse. The homes of men Were now all desolate, and darkness there, And solitude and silence took their seat In the deserted streets, as if the wing Of a destroying angel had gone by, And blasted all existence, and had changed The gay, the busy, and the crowded mart To one cold, speechless city of the dead. THE DESERTED WIFE. He comes not—I have watch'd the moon go down, But yet he comes not—Once it was not so. He thinks not how these bitter tears do flow, The while he holds his riot in that town. Yet he will come, and chide, and I shall weep; And he will wake my infant from its sleep, To blend its feeble wailing with my tears. O! how I love a mother's watch to keep, Over those sleeping eyes, that smile, which cheers My heart, though sunk in sorrow, fix'd and deep. I had a husband once, who loved me—now He ever wears a frown upon his brow, And feeds his passion on a wanton's lip, As bees, from laurel flowers, a poison sip; But yet I cannot hate—O! there were hours, When I could hang for ever on his eye, And time who stole with silent swiftness by, Strew'd, as he hurried on, his path with flowers. I loved him then—he loved me too—My heart Still finds its fondness kindle, if he smile; The memory of our loves will ne'er depart; And though he often sting me with a dart, Venom'd and barb'd, and waste upon the vile, Caresses which his babe and mine should share; Though he should spurn me, I will calmly bear His madness—and should sickness come, and lay Its paralyzing hand upon him, then I would, with kindness, all my wrongs repay, Until the penitent should weep, and say, How injured, and how faithful I had been. THE CORAL GROVE. Deep in the wave is a coral grove, Where the purple mullet, and gold-fish rove, Where the sea-flower spreads its leaves of blue, That never are wet with falling dew, But in bright and changeful beauty shine, Far down in the green and glassy brine. The floor is of sand, like the mountain drift, And the pearl shells spangle the flinty snow; From coral rocks the sea plants lift Their boughs, where the tides and billows flow; The water is calm and still below, For the winds and waves are absent there, And the sands are bright as the stars that glow In the motionless fields of upper air: There with its waving blade of green, The sea-flag streams through the silent water, And the crimson leaf of the dulse is seen To blush, like a banner bathed in slaughter: There with a light and easy motion, The fan-coral sweeps through the clear deep sea; And the yellow and scarlet tufts of ocean Are bending like corn on the upland lea: And life, in rare and beautiful forms, Is sporting amid those bowers of stone, And is safe, when the wrathful spirit of storms, Has made the top of the waves his own: And when the ship from his fury flies, Where the myriad voices of ocean roar, When the wind-god frowns in the murky skies, And demons are waiting the wreck on shore; Then far below in the peaceful sea, The purple mullet, and gold-fish rove, Where the waters murmur tranquilly, Through the bending twigs of the coral grove. TO SENECA LAKE. On thy fair bosom, silver lake! The wild swan spreads his snowy sail, And round his breast the ripples break, As down he bears before the gale. On thy fair bosom, waveless stream! The dipping paddle echoes far, And flashes in the moonlight gleam, And bright reflects the polar star. The waves along thy pebbly shore, As blows the north wind, heave their foam, And curl around the dashing oar, As late the boatman hies him home. How sweet, at set of sun, to view Thy golden mirror spreading wide, And see the mist of mantling blue Float round the distant mountain's side. At midnight hour, as shines the moon, A sheet of silver spreads below, And swift she cuts, at highest noon, Light clouds, like wreaths of purest snow. On thy fair bosom, silver lake! O! I could ever sweep the oar, When early birds at morning wake, And evening tells us toil is o'er. CONSUMPTION. There is a sweetness in woman's decay, When the light of beauty is fading away, When the bright enchantment of youth is gone, And the tint that glow'd, and the eye that shone, And darted around its glance of power, And the lip that vied with the sweetest flower, That ever in Pæstum's garden blew, Or ever was steep'd in fragrant dew, When all that was bright and fair, has fled, But the loveliness lingering round the dead. O! there is a sweetness in beauty's close, Like the perfume scenting the wither'd rose; For a nameless charm around her plays, And her eyes are kindled with hallow'd rays, And a veil of spotless purity Has mantled her cheek with its heavenly dye, Like a cloud whereon the queen of night Has pour'd her softest tint of light; And there is a blending of white and blue, Where the purple blood is melting through The snow of her pale and tender cheek; And there are tones, that sweetly speak Of a spirit, who longs for a purer day, And is ready to wing her flight away. In the flush of youth and the spring of feeling, When life, like a sunny stream, is stealing Its silent steps through a flowery path, And all the endearments, that pleasure hath, Are pour'd from her full, o'erflowing horn, When the rose of enjoyment conceals no thorn, In her lightness of heart, to the cheery song The maiden may trip in the dance along, And think of the passing moment, that lies Like a fairy dream, in her dazzled eyes, And yield to the present, that charms around With all that is lovely in sight and sound, Where a thousand pleasing phantoms flit, With the voice of mirth, and the burst of wit, And the music that steals to the bosom's core, And the heart in its fulness flowing o'er With a few big drops, that are soon repress'd, For short is the stay of grief in her breast: In this enliven'd and gladsome hour The spirit may burn with a brighter power; But dearer the calm and quiet day, When the heaven-sick soul is stealing away. And when her sun is low declining, And life wears out with no repining, And the whisper, that tells of early death, Is soft as the west wind's balmy breath, When it comes at the hour of still repose, To sleep in the breast of the wooing rose, And the lip, that swell'd with a living glow, Is pale as a curl of new-fallen snow; And her cheek, like the Parian stone, is fair, But the hectic spot that flushes there, When the tide of life, from its secret dwelling, In a sudden gush, is deeply swelling, And giving a tinge to her icy lips, Like the crimson rose's brightest tips, As richly red and as transient too, As the clouds, in autumn sky of blue, That seem like a host of glory met To honor the sun at his golden set: O! then, when the spirit is taking wing, How fondly her thoughts to her dear one cling, As if she would blend her soul with his In a deep and long imprinted kiss; So fondly the panting camel flies, Where the glassy vapor cheats his eyes, And the dove from the falcon seeks her nest, And the infant shrinks to his mother's breast. And though her dying voice be mute, Or faint as the tones of an unstrung lute, And though the glow from her cheek be fled, And her pale lips cold as the marble dead, Her eye still beams unwonted fires With a woman's love and a saint's desires, And her last fond, lingering look is given To the love she leaves, and then to heaven, As if she would bear that love away To a purer world and a brighter day. THE SERENADE. Softly the moonlight Is shed on the lake, Cool is the summer night— Wake! O awake! Faintly the curfew Is heard from afar, List ye! O list! To the lively guitar. Trees cast a mellow shade Over the vale, Sweetly the serenade Breathes in the gale, Softly and tenderly Over the lake, Gaily and cheerily— Wake! O awake! See the light pinnace Draws nigh to the shore, Swiftly it glides At the heave of the oar, Cheerily plays On its buoyant car, Nearer and nearer The lively guitar. Now the wind rises And ruffles the pine, Ripples foam-crested Like diamonds shine, They flash, where the waters The white pebbles lave, In the wake of the moon, As it crosses the wave. Bounding from billow To billow, the boat Like a wild swan is seen On the waters to float; And the light dipping oars Bear it smoothly along In time to the air Of the Gondolier's song. And high on the stern Stands the young and the brave, As love-led he crosses The star-spangled wave, And blends with the murmur Of water and grove The tones of the night, That are sacred to love. His gold-hilted sword At his bright belt is hung, His mantle of silk On his shoulder is flung, And high waves the feather, That dances and plays On his cap where the buckle And rosary blaze. The maid from the lattice Looks down on the lake, To see the foam sparkle, The bright billow break, And to hear in his boat, Where he shines like a star, Her lover so tenderly Touch his guitar. She opens the lattice, And sits in the glow Of the moonlight and starlight, A statue of snow; And she sings in a voice, That is broken with sighs, And she darts on her lover The light of her eyes. His love-speaking pantomine Tells her his soul— How wild in that sunny clime Hearts and eyes roll. She waves with her white hand Her white fazzolett, And her burning thoughts flash From her eyes' living jet. The moonlight is hid In a vapor of snow; Her voice and his rebeck Alternately flow; Re-echoed they swell From the rock on the hill; They sing their farewell, And the music is still. THE GRAVES OF THE PATRIOTS. Here rest the great and good—here they repose After their generous toil. A sacred band, They take their sleep together, while the year Comes with its early flowers to deck their graves, And gathers them again, as winter frowns. Theirs is no vulgar sepulchre—green sods Are all their monument, and yet it tells A nobler history, than pillar'd piles, Or the eternal pyramids. They need No statue nor inscription to reveal Their greatness. It is round them, and the joy With which their children tread the hallowed ground That holds their venerated bones, the peace That smiles on all they fought for, and the wealth That clothes the land they rescued,—these, though mute, As feeling ever is when deepest,—these Are monuments more lasting, than the fanes Rear'd to the kings and demigods of old. Touch not the ancient elms, that bend their shade Over their lowly graves; beneath their boughs There is a solemn darkness, even at noon, Suited to such as visit at the shrine Of serious liberty. No factious voice Call'd them unto the field of generous fame, But the pure consecrated love of home. No deeper feeling sways us, when it wakes In all its greatness. It has told itself To the astonish'd gaze of awe-struck kings, At Marathon, at Bannockburn, and here, Where first our patriots sent the invader back Broken and cowed. Let these green elms be all To tell us where they fought, and where they lie. Their feelings were all nature, and they need No art to make them known. They live in us, While we are like them, simple, hardy, bold, Worshipping nothing but our own pure hearts, And the one universal Lord. They need No column pointing to the heaven they sought, To tell us of their home. The heart itself, Left to its own free purpose, hastens there, And there alone reposes. Let these elms Bend their protecting shadow o'er their graves, And build with their green roof the only fane, Where we may gather on the hallow'd day, That rose to them in blood, and set in glory. Here let us meet, and while our motionless lips Give not a sound, and all around is mute In the deep sabbath of a heart too full For words or tears—here let us strew the sod With the first flowers of spring, and make to them An offering of the plenty, Nature gives, And they have render'd ours—perpetually. SPRING. Again the infant flowers of Spring Call thee to sport on thy rainbow wing— Spirit of Beauty! the air is bright With the boundless flow of thy mellow light; The woods are ready to bud and bloom, And are weaving for Summer their quiet gloom; The turfed brook reflects, as it flows, The tips of the half-unopen'd rose, And the early bird, as he carols free, Sings to his little love, and thee. See how the clouds, as they fleetly pass, Throw their shadowy veil on the darkening grass; And the pattering showers and stealing dews, With their starry gems and skyey hues, From the oozy meadow, that drinks the tide, To the shelter'd vale on the mountain side, Wake to a new and fresher birth The tenderest tribes of teeming earth, And scatter with light and dallying play Their earliest flowers on the zephyr's way. He comes from the mountain's piny steep, For the long boughs bend with a silent sweep, And his rapid steps have hurried o'er The grassy hills to the pebbly shore; And now, on the breast of the lonely lake, The waves in silvery glances break, Like a short and quickly rolling sea, When the gale first feels its liberty, And the flakes of foam, like coursers, run, Rejoicing beneath the vertical sun. He has cross'd the lake, and the forest heaves, To the sway of his wings, its billowy leaves, And the downy tufts of the meadow fly In snowy clouds, as he passes by, And softly beneath his noiseless tread The odorous spring-grass bends its head; And now he reaches the woven bower, Where he meets his own beloved flower, And gladly his wearied limbs repose, In the shade of the newly-opening rose. THE DESOLATE CITY. I had a vision.— A city before me, desolate, And yet not all decay'd. A summer sun Shone on it from a most etherial sky, And the soft winds threw o'er it such a balm, One would have thought it was a sepulchre, And this the incense offer'd to the manes Of the departed. In the light it lay Peacefully, as if all its thousands took Their afternoon's repose, and soon would wake To the loud joy of evening. There it lay, A city of magnificent palaces, And churches, towering more like things of heaven, The glorious fabrics, fancy builds in clouds, And shapes on loftiest mountains—bright their domes Threw back the living ray, and proudly stood Many a statue, looking like the forms Of spirits hovering in mid air. Tall trees, Cypress and plane, waved over many a hill Cumber'd with ancient ruins—broken arches, And tottering columns—vaults, where never came The blessed beam of day, but only lamps Shedding a funeral light, were kindled there, And gave to the bright frescoes on the walls, And the pale statues in their far recesses, A dim religious awe. Rudely they lay, Scarce marking out to the inquisitive eye Their earliest outline. But as desolate Slumber'd the newer city, though its walls Were yet unbroken, and its towering domes Had never stoop'd to ruin. All was still; Hardly the faintest sound of living thing Moved through the mighty solitude—and yet All wore the face of beauty. Not a cloud Hung in the lofty sky, that seem'd to rise In twofold majesty, so bright and pure, It seem'd indeed a crystaline sphere—and there The sun rode onward in his conquering march Serenely glorious. From the mountain heights Tinged with the blue of heaven, to the wide sea Glass'd with as pure a blue, one desolate plain Spread out, and over it the fairest sky Bent round and bless'd it. Life was teeming there In all its lower forms, a wilderness Of rank luxuriance; flowers, and purpling vines Matted with deepest foliage, hid the ruins, And gave the semblance of a tangled wood To piles, that once were loudly eloquent With the glad cry of thousands. There were gardens Round stateliest villas, full of graceful statues, And temples rear'd to woodland deities; And they were overcrowded with the excess Of beauty. All that most is coveted Beneath a colder sky, grew wantonly And richly there. Myrtles and citrons fill'd The air with fragrance. From the tufted elm, Bent with its own too massy foliage, hung Clusters of sunny grapes in frosted purple, Drinking in spirit from the glowing air, And dropping generous dews. The very wind Seem'd there a lover, and his easy wings Fann'd the gay bowers, as if in fond delay He bent o'er loveliest things, too beautiful Ever to know decay. The silent air Floating as softly as a cloud of roses, Dropp'd from Idalia in a dewy shower,— The air itself seem'd like the breath of heaven Filling the groves of Eden. Yet these walls Are desolate—not a trace of living man Is found amid these glorious works of man, And nature's fairer glories. Why should he Be absent from the festival of life, The holiday of nature? Why not come To add to the sweet sounds of winds and waters— Of winds uttering Æolian melodies To the bright, listening flowers, and waters falling Most musical from marble fountains wreathed With clustering ivy, like a poet's brow— Why comes he not to add his higher strains, And be the interpreter of lower things, In intellectual worship, at the throne Of the Beneficent Power, that gave to them Their pride and beauty?—“In these palaces, These awful temples, these religious caves, These hoary ruins, and these twilight groves Teeming with life and love,—a secret plague Dwells, and the unwary foot, that ventures here, Returns not.—Fly! To linger here is death.” WILLIAM E. GALLAUDET LINES TO THE WESTERN MUMMY. O stranger, whose repose profound These latter ages dare to break, And call thee from beneath the ground Ere nature did thy slumber shake! What wonders of the secret earth Thy lip, too silent, might reveal! Of tribes round whose mysterious birth A thousand envious ages wheel! Thy race by savage war o'errun, Sunk down, their very name forgot; But ere those fearful times begun, Perhaps, in this sequester'd spot, By friendship's hand thine eyelids closed, By friendship's hand the turf was laid— And friendship here perhaps reposed, With moonlight vigils in the shade. The stars have run their nightly round, The sun look'd out and pass'd his way, And many a season o'er the ground Has trod where thou so softly lay. And wilt thou not one moment raise Thy weary head, awhile to see The later sports of earthly days, How like what once enchanted thee? Thy name, thy date, thy life declare— Perhaps a queen whose feathery band A thousand maids have sigh'd to wear, The brightest in thy beauteous band. Perhaps a Helen, from whose eye Love kindled up the flame of war— Ah me! do thus thy graces lie A faded phantom and no more! O! not like thee would I remain, But o'er the earth my ashes strew, And in some rising bud regain The freshness that my childhood knew. But has thy soul, O maid! so long Around this mournful relict dwelt? Or burst away with pinion strong, And at the foot of mercy knelt? Or has it in some distant clime With curious eye unsated stray'd, And down the winding stream of time On every changeful current play'd? Or lock'd in everlasting sleep Must we thy heart extinct deplore? Thy fancy lost in darkness, weep, And sigh for her who feels no more? Or exiled to some humbler sphere, In yonder wood-dove dost thou dwell. And murmuring in the stranger's ear, Thy tender melancholy tell? Whoe'er thou be, thy sad remains Shall from the muse a tear demand, Who, wandering on these distant plains. Looks fondly to a distant land. EDWARD EVERETT. DIRGE OF ALARIC, THE VISIGOTH, Who stormed and spoiled the city of Rome, and was afterwards buried in the channel of the river Busentius, the water of which had been diverted from its course that the body might be interred. When I am dead, no pageant train Shall waste their sorrows at my bier, Nor worthless pomp of homage vain, Stain it with hypocritic tear; For I will die as I did live, Nor take the boon I cannot give. Ye shall not raise a marble bust Upon the spot where I repose; Ye shall not fawn before my dust, In hollow circumstance of woes: Nor sculptured clay, with lying breath, Insult the clay that moulds beneath. Ye shall not pile, with servile toil, Your monuments upon my breast, Nor yet within the common soil Lay down the wreck of Power to rest; Where man can boast that he has trod On him, that was “the scourge of God.” But ye the mountain stream shall turn, And lay its secret channel bare, And hollow, for your sovereign's urn, A resting-place for ever there: Then bid its everlasting springs Flow back upon the King of Kings; And never be the secret said, Until the deep give up his dead. My gold and silver ye shall fling Back to the clods, that gave them birth;— The captured crowns of many a king, The ransom of a conquered earth: For e'en though dead will I control The trophies of the capitol. But when beneath the mountain tide, Ye 've laid your monarch down to rot, Ye shall not rear upon its side Pillar or mound to mark the spot; For long enough the world has shook Beneath the terrors of my look; And now that I have run my race, The astonish'd realms shall rest a space. My course was like a river deep, And from the northern hills I burst, Across the world in wrath to sweep, And where I went, the spot was cursed. Nor blade of grass again was seen Where Alaric and his hosts had been. See how their haughty barriers fail Beneath the terror of the Goth, Their iron-breasted legions quail Before my ruthless sabaoth, And low the queen of empires kneels, And grovels at my chariot-wheels. Not for myself did I ascend In judgment my triumphal car; 'T was God alone on high did send The avenging Scythian to the war, To shake abroad, with iron hand, The appointed scourge of his command With iron hand that scourge I rear'd O'er guilty king and guilty realm; Destruction was the ship I steer'd, And vengeance sat upon the helm, When, launch'd in fury on the flood, I plough'd my ways through seas of blood, And in the stream their hearts had spilt Wash'd out the long arrears of guilt. Across the everlasting Alp I pour'd the torrent of my powers, And feeble Cæsars shriek'd for help In vain within their seven-hill'd towers; I quench'd in blood the brightest gem That glitter'd in their diadem, And struck a darker, deeper die In the purple of their majesty, And bade my northern banners shine Upon the conquer'd Palatine. My course is run, my errand done: I go to Him from whence I came, But never yet shall set the sun Of glory that adorns my name; And Roman hearts shall long be sick, When men shall think of Alaric. My course is run, my errand done— But darker ministers of fate, Impatient, round the eternal throne, And in the caves of vengeance, wait And soon mankind shall blench away Before the name of Attila. JOHN EVERETT SAINT PAUL'S CHURCH, BOSTON. Beautiful, pure and simple, there thou stand'st, Fit temple for the pure and only God, Smiling in cold severity. The heart That views thee, fills with the bright memory Of other days; the sunny lands of song, In their sad, lovely silence of decay, Rise up to the remembrance in thy sight. The thoughts of other days, when Plato stood At Sunium: when the imperial one, herself, Athena, visited the Parthenon: Or of the later age, when the proud Roman, Within the vast Pantheon's walls, beheld One stream of purest lustre from above, Lighting the idol-habited Rotund. Not unacceptable was their ignorant worship To him they served in darkness, but to thee A nobler precept than Colonna heard, A purer light than the Pantheon saw Is given. Thy cherub songs, and wreathed flowers, Incense and sacrifice and gifts devote, Are prayer and penitence, the tearful eye, The innocent life, the broken, contrite heart. Simple in elegance, no mounting spire, Tower, minaret, nor gaily burnish'd dome Mars thy severe proportions. No device Of polish'd moulding, sculptured tracery, Not e'en the soft acanthine folds are there, Like the divine magnificence of virtue, Whose ornament would not obscure its worth. Now, while yon moonbeam gently steals along The columns of that simple peristyle, Silvering the massive shaft and plain volute Of yon extremest pillar, let me gaze With calm delight insatiate. There is given A moral feeling to a beautiful scene Of glorious art with nature join'd, like this,— And memory crown'd with moonlight roses, lives To hover o'er the storied names of old; Heroes and sages deathless—the pure heart Of him Plato. whose lip with sweetest nectar dew'd, Breathed the great lesson of his godlike teacher Socrates.— Martyr of freedom—him Dion. of Syracuse— The glorious fratricide Timoleon., the immortal Theban Epaminondas., And their bright heritors of guiltless suffering, Intrepid Algernon, and youthful Russell,— Till the remembrance softens. Not in vain, Oh! not in vain did the Athenians Ally the arts to freedom, and invite Blushing Pictura and her marble sister Up the stern heights of the Acropolis. So be it with our country. May she stand Like thee, modell'd on wisdom of the past, Yet with the lovely gracefulness of youth. SONG. Come not to me, my dearest love, When hope is gay and wo is fled; Sad is my bower and high above, Deep trees their shroudlike branches spread. But when that wo tenfold returns, When in the dust those hopes shall be, When with deep pain thy bosom burns, Then thou, my love, must come to me. For thee, my desert bower I'll dress, For thee will light my tearful eyes; For thee will braid each raven tress That now in wild disorder flies. And grief, who sits within my cell A constant visitor to me, Shall greet thee, for she knows full well How sadly sweet I'll sing to thee. SONG. Sing to me as in old “lang syne,” Thy sweet neglected songs. To other hearts, oh! not to mine, Thy newer, lighter strain belongs, My desert memory it wrongs. The strains thou lightly hurried'st o'er To charm the gallant and the gay, The brighter smile thy features wore, When ceased thy sportive roundelay, How changed from that more lovely day! Then to the known, the loved, the few, Awoke each dear, familiar tone, Which every heart instinctive knew And thrilling answer'd with its own, Till not a note was felt alone. Gone are the few—the known estranged, Perchance 'tis right thy melody Like them and these and all be changed, And none preserve those songs but me To think on what has been, what ne'er shall be. SONG. Tom Moore, again we're met— By the sparkles of thine eye, By thy lip with bright wine wet, Thou art glad as well as I. And thine eye shall gleam the brighter Ere our meeting shall be o'er And thy minstrelsy flow lighter With our healths to thee, Tom Moore. For thy boyish songs of woman Thrown about like unstrung pearls, Ere thy armed spirit's summon Bade thee leave thy bright-hair'd girls; For thy satire's quenchless arrows On the foes thy country bore, For thy song of Erin's sorrows, Here 's health to thee, Tom Moore. Drink to Moore, drink to Moore— What though England renounce him, Her dark days shall soon be o'er, And her brightest band surrounds him. In the land, then, of the vine, To thee, its glittering drops we pour, And in warmest, reddest wine, Drink a health to thee, Tom Moore. TO FANNI IN A BALL DRESS. Thou hast braided thy dark flowing hair, And wreathed it with rosebuds and pearls; But dearer, neglected thy sweet tresses are, Soft falling in natural curls. Thou delightest the cold world's gaze, When crown'd with the flower and the gem, But thy lover's smile should be dearer praise Than the incense thou prizest from them. The bloom on thy young cheek is bright With triumph enjoy'd too well, Yet less dear than when soft as the moonbeam's light, Or the tinge in a hyacinth bell. And gay is the playful tone, As to flattery's voice thou respondest: But what is the praise of the cold and unknown, To the tender blame of the fondest? THOMAS O. FOLSOM CLOUDS. Beautiful clouds in the quiet sky Whence come ye, floating so proudly by? “We come from the land where the forest's gloom Frowns darkly around the old warrior's tomb, Where the ramparts he rear'd still their strength retain, Though ye seek their defender's name in vain. “We have cross'd the streams of the boundless west, We have cluster'd in wreaths round the mountain's crest, We have swept the prairie's lonely green, O'er buffalo herds we have hung a screen, We have shadow'd the path that the hunters take, And obscured the gleam of the sunny lake.” Clouds that are skirted with golden light, What have ye seen in your airy flight? “We have seen stern gloom on the Indian's brow, And the grief that stung him, but could not bow, As he left the shore where his fathers rest, To seek a new home in the far-off west. “We have seen the desert from wildness freed, And the hardy husbandman scattering seed, Villages rising by every stream, And the white sail glancing in morning's beam; Yet we saw that woes every scene deprave, For we look'd on many a fresh-dug grave.” Say, what is the end of your pilgrimage? “We have seen the mountain oak scathed by age, On the shiver'd crag there is writ—decay— Shall we be more happy and strong than they? Man's labors and glories doth time obscure— And shall we, things of vapor and shade, endure? “Beauteous and dense as we seem to you, We are vanishing fast from your wondering view, For the sweeping gust and the sunny ray Are hurrying and melting our fleeces away; When the morning comes in its glowing sheen, Not a mist will tell we have ever been.” Beautiful clouds, it is ever thus, Stern time is consuming our works and us; And ye—though storms in your robe are roll'd, Though the thunder sleep in your dusky fold, Though ye boast a heavenly home and birth Ye must fade away like things of earth. WAR SONG. Is it the welcome roar Of thundering signal gun?— Hark! for the sound bursts through once more, Rending night's robe of dun. It is the welcome sound, The joyous call to war, For the near bugle screams around The cry to arms—hurrah! From beauty's straining arms And banquet pleasures spring, Bring out the trusty sword and steed, Our proud old banner bring; The drum is rolling loud, Clatters the ponderous car, And mustering warriors onward crowd And blithely shout—hurrah! The early dawn shall glance On the long gleaming line, Proudly the buoyant plume will dance, And burnish'd bayonet shine; The soldier's heart will leap As trumpets ring afar,— They summon him away to reap His wreaths of fame—hurrah! Lo! yonder comes the foe— Rush on with gun and glaive, For freedom 't is ye strike below The banner of the brave; On—on, until they fly, Their fiercest daring mar— 'T is well! fling down the brand and cry The victor shout—hurrah! JONATHAN M. SCOTT [Land of the East, whose fertile vales unfold] Land of the East, whose fertile vales unfold The fairest product of the fruitful year; Whose towering hills upon their summits hold A hardy race, to wildest freedom dear, Unaw'd by danger, unrestrain'd by fear; How are thy prospects changed! the plough no more, Worn bright by labor, checks the panting steer Through reeking furrow toiling, as of yore, Nor clamorous seamen ply along the busy shore. Around some tavern door thy children stand, Where swings the grating sign on windy day, Cheerless and sad, a melancholy band, Till draughts of whiskey wile their cares away; Then loud of tongue, impetuous for affray, All raise at once of wisdom full the voice, And beardless valor, and experience gray, In hideous uproar wild increase the noise, While oft replenish'd cups exalt the noontide joys. Oh, stream Lethean! reeking from the still, How sweet thy stimulus at early dawn! When wakes the thirsty wretch, the welcome rill Dispels of recollection thoughts forlorn; For oft the aching head at rising morn, A sad memento of the evening past, From long protracted slumber slowly drawn, Toward the accustom'd cup a look will cast, And sigh, perhaps in vain, to think that cup the last. War's crimson banner broad unfurl'd, Waves horrid o'er the western world; Full swells the note of rolling drum, Like distant thunder, hoarse and grum. And sharp and shrill the piercing fife Wakes the stern soul to deeds of strife. The peaceful scythe its form forsakes, The bending cutlass' curve it takes; Wrenched from its shape by glowing heat, And on the groaning anvil beat; The shining pitchfork strait is set, Transform'd to pointed bayonet, Disdainful of its former trade And proudly glitters on parade. Each wayward youngster from the field In fancy grasps the victor shield, With beating heart he seeks the plain, Intent on glory and on gain; Before his eyes, in beam divine, The rising hopes of plunder shine; For plunder, trade aside is cast— The cobler leaves his mouldy last; The homespun frock and beaver gray, Are changed to regimentals gay; The tailor's work is left undone, While 'prentice lads to combat run; And o'er each lately smiling brow Frowns pale and lurid anger now. Is there a heart so wild and rude, But sickens at commencing feud? Then let that rugged heart sojourn Beyond Caffraria's utmost bourn; Pitch with the Arab wild his tent, Or on some desert island, rent From the mainland by torrent storm, His lonely habitation form. Alas! those fields, which late so gay Spread their broad surface to the day— Within the broad potato patch In vain for food the children scratch; No longer are the swine debarr'd From entrance to the turnip yard; Thy fields, O Weathersfield, of yore That many a pungent onion bore, Now overgrown with noisome weeds, No longer savory garlic feeds; There many a harvest lost, his purse, Devoid of cash, the swain shall curse! And many a marriage long delay'd Rue the sad year when war was made. Ah, me! how many tears that day Shrunk from their crystal source away! And many a damsel's cheek grew pale, And many a bosom heaved the sigh, And many a matron told the tale, The dismal tale, of battle nigh. Ah, me! unfit for warlike deed, For cannon's roar, or charging steed; Ill suits the sabre's ruthless blade The hand accustom'd to the spade; And nerves that wont to wield the hoe, Relax before the deadly blow. Land of my sires! that spirits stern Within thy children's bosoms burn, Full well I know; on muster day, When thoughts of war were far away, How oft the sun that cloudless rose, At eve has witness'd many a nose With blood defiled; and many an eye The rainbow's varied tints defy. Though, cramp'd with age, my sluggish blood Rolls through my veins in languid flood, Still swells with life renew'd, the vein, As memory views the young campaign; And many a scar upon my head Recalls the day of battle fled. Yet in this youthful warrior-school, Stern wisdom held her rigid rule; Unlike the sons of southern shore, Who bathe their blades in foeman's gore; Whose boiling blood in realms of fire Delighted sees his foe expire; And from the combat lifeless drops, Or limping homeward wounded hops. With us, the brawny fist supply'd The pistol's place at battle tide; By dint of lusty thump and kick, Or aid of massy walking stick; By hand, and teeth, and stubborn foot, Was settled every dire dispute; We wisely shunn'd the hissing ball, And knew life lost, was loss of all. Alas! how oft the poet's line Has mourn'd the fickle mind of man; The theme of every sage divine, Since tythes and sermons first began. Mournful the poet, at midnight hour, Beholds the politician sage, He sees the world his worth adore, His name descend to latest age; Let morning come, the hammer's sound Recalls him to his daily trade; And while the lapstone rings around, He fairly is a cobler made. Even thus, at ward-room table too, Behold the chiefs of England's crew; Ere yet across its social bound The tenth decanter has gone round, Who but would think assembled there, Souls that might Alexander dare; Beat Hannibal in bloody work, Or wrench his whiskers from the Turk; Eclipse the Swedish Charles in war, Or show with Nelson scar for scar; Brave the wild savage war-whoop yell, And bear the palm from William Tell? GEORGE BANCROFT THE FAIRY OF THE WENGERN-ALP. On Wenger's verdant height I stood; Rapt in delight I gazed around O'er mountain, glacier, valley, wood, The “Virgin's” own enchanted ground. By Fancy's strangest phantoms led, My spirit wander'd far and high; I long'd on hills of snow to tread, And o'er the seas of ice to fly. Hope whisper'd, Nature could unbind The heavy chains of earth, and give Wings to the ransom'd soul that pined With beings of the air to live, Who rule each mighty element, (As well is sung by bards of old) And oft, by mightier spirit sent, Earth's mysteries to man unfold. Or are the days of marvel past? Does Magic wave no more her wand? Has wondering Faith retired at last? And leads no path to fairy land? But if e'en now as bards believe, Still roams and rules the fairy race, Then, Spirits, bid me cease to grieve, And soar the Genius of the place. I turned to where the Virgin rose In still communion with the sky; Eternity hath heap'd its snows Round her in unstain'd purity. O'er her fair features gently hung The morning's thin transparent cloud; While round her breast was rudely flung The vapors' denser, darker shroud. But near the “Silver Peak” was seen With his fair snow-heaps, like a gay And gallant page beside a queen, That frowns in armor's stern array. His sides, that like the cygnet's breast Were white and crisped, beam'd afar; The sun but touch'd his topmost crest, That sparkled like the evening star. Right glad such beauty to behold, Plead thou for me, sweet star, I cried; For 't is thy light that makes me bold; Oh loveliest star! be thou my guide. Then toward the Virgin's form I knelt; “O spotless Virgin! hear my prayer; Command this earthly flesh to melt; My soul would wander free in air.” And as I still admiring bow'd, And hoped a kind reply to hear, From the deep bosom of the cloud, A gentle voice fell on my ear. “Like mountain air would'st thou be free, Be pure as is the mountain air; Mortal! from vice and pleasure flee, And gladly will I grant thy prayer.” “Then, Virgin, deign my wish to grant; Though but the meanest of thy train. This lovely spot I 'd rather haunt, Than o'er the world beside to reign. My heart like thine is pure and chaste, On nature's bosom oft I 've leant, And oft the morning wind embraced; But ne'er my neck hath pleasure bent. To thee a virgin heart would bear Its earliest fruits. Unveil thy brow; Thy holy love I long to share, O! take me to thy bosom now.” See, the dark clouds asunder roll, And yon tall form sublimely gleams In dazzling beauty; on the soul Burst life and rapture with its beams. Is it the sun, that gently checks His fiery steeds o'er Alps' fair child, Gilding with glory all her peaks? No! 't was the Virgin queen that smiled. O'er me her hallow'd light she throws; She blends with majesty divine Mildness, and whispers from her snows; “Come thou to me, for thou art mine.” Farewell, thou lower earth, farewell! I haste to rush in foaming floods, Where elves and fairies roam to dwell, To woo the nymphs of tannen woods, With Iris watch the waterfall, And smile and shine in glittering spray, To heed the Virgin's beckoning call, And haste o'er earth her will to obey. An eagle pass'd; I cried aloud, Away swift bird, I'll soar with thee. Rushing we pierced the lofty cloud, Beneath us waved the tannen tree; Even to the glacier's tallest height, We soar'd o'er fields of icy blue; Long round its gay transparent light, Pleased with the novel scene, I flew. “Blue is the light of beauty's eye; And blue the waves where swells the sea; And blue at noon my native sky; But nought is fair and blue like thee, Thou lovely pyramid of light! Thou graceful daughter of the snows Thy sire the sun is ne'er so bright, As when his beams on thee repose.” From rock to rock the ice to dash, That totter'd on its base, I sprung; Now tumbling with a fearful crash, To every peak it lends a tongue; 'T is dash'd to dust; the frozen spray Sweeps onward o'er the precipice, Resplendent in the eye of day, A sparkling cataract of ice. And where it stood there open'd wide A chasm of azure, dark and deep; 'T is there the mountain spirits glide, To where their court the fairies keep. I did not fear, but ventured too Along the glittering icy walls, Full many a fathom downwards flew, And came to Nature's inmost halls. A Paradise of light I found, Where Nature builds of vilest earth Her crystal home, and under ground Brings all that's beautiful to birth. And o'er her ever youthful face Wisdom hath spread a light serene; While round her throne the fairy race Are floating in unearthly sheen. Some hearken'd to their mistress' call; Some sported 'mid the heaps of snow; Some glided with the waterfall; Some sat above its glittering bow, Seeming o'er Nature's works to muse; And some their little limbs array'd; These dew-drops for their mirror use; Of light and air their robes are made. And others bent with serious look To prove the new made crystals' light; While earth's dark substance others took, And changed the mass to diamonds bright. But as I gain'd the fairy ground, They ceased awhile from toil and sport, And the young stranger gathering round, Cried—“Welcome, youth, to Nature's court.” A fairy then with accents bland Gently, as fairies wont to do, Came near and said, “This wondrous land Of airy sprites I'll lead thee through.” Guided by her I dared to gaze Where Nature's servants restless toil The rocks of sand and chalk to raise, The granite's tall unyielding pile. And oft a narrow space they leave, Where vitriol's azure drops to pour, Or thinnest threads of silver weave In baser metals' glittering ore. And when they mingle air and light With iron black or sluggish lead, Eye hath not seen so fair a sight, Such brilliant hues, green, white, and red. I saw the home of every wind; And where the ocean's base is laid; And where the earthquake sleeps confined, Till Destiny demands its aid; And where from magazines of snow The mighty rivers foaming well; And more than mortals e'er can know, And more than fairy's tongue can tell. Long did I stand enraptured there, Nor ceased to gaze in full delight. Mother of beauty, thou art fair! O Nature, lovely is thy might. For ever would I dwell with thee! For ever to thy train belong. Then she that led me, smiled to see My admiration deep and strong, And thus in kindest mood began; “O! wouldst thou Nature's love return, Remember that thou once wast man, Young elf; to heal man's sorrows learn; Spread calmness round the couch of pain; Comfort the mourning; soothe disease; Support the wavering; and sustain The form that shrinks at winter's breeze; A guardian power, o'er virtue bend; Shed round the young sweet influence; To the lone wanderer vigor lend; And anxious watch o'er innocence; From pleasure's wiles preserve the fair; Then shall the Virgin love thee well, And haply trust to thee the care Of vales, where peace and virtue dwell. And now thou 'rt one of us; canst roam In fire, earth, air, o'er ocean's wave; Canst fly to bless thy ancient home, From age and pain thy parents save; And rest awhile delighted where Thy youthful sisters harmless play, Nor deem their brother hovering near, To drive each guilty thought away. For know, we bless the infant's head; We guard the fair; the good we shield; We teach the young, to virtue bred, Her arms victoriously to wield; We paint with light the opening flowers; Of every herb we know the name; The sea is ours; the earth is ours; We rule the air; we rule the flame.” The social fairy ceased to speak. There 's many a joy, that mortals know; But oft when pleasure's flower they seek, The leaves conceal the worm of wo; 'T is sweet to watch the kindling eye Of parents, kin, or friends, or wife; But sweeter 't is in air to fly, And happiest is the fairy's life. JOHN RUDOLPH SUTERMEISTER A CONTRASTED PICTURE. The morning sun!—the morning sun!— How o'er the earth his lustres move;— When his first glance he throws upon The bright, the glowing heaven above!— The birds seek now each verdant spray— Now glide, on light and joyous wing, To pour on air their roundelay,— To wake on high their carolling! The soul of halcyon repose Sleeps on the soft and silver air; The zephyr's breath is on the rose And on the woodbine's blossoms fair:— The dew reflects the orient sun, Whose magic tints to it are given; O, man's fond eye ne'er look'd upon A fairer earth—a brighter heaven! The morning sun—the morning sun!— Joy wakes to view his glories spread, When night hath chased the clouds of dun Whose gloomy folds waved overhead:— When Nature wakes from soft repose— While sports young May in earth's green bowers, Joy wakes to breathe the fragrant rose— The woodbine's rich and matchless flowers:— To dash, with foot-fall light, away From the green sward, the dews of heaven;— To list the wild-bird's varied lay While on the breeze their plumes are given:— How blest is joy's o'erflowing heart, To bask beneath the golden dawn:— To view the sun his light impart To the bright flowers and dewy lawn! The dying sun—the dying sun!— How sink his languid rays to rest, When twilight throws her shroud upon The pale and melancholy west; The rose that bloom'd in early May, Droops now on its deserted stem;— O'er its sere leaves and blighted spray Pours the night-wind its requiem! The birds, which sung, in summer's light, And danced on bright and purple wing, Wake not the tuneless ear of night,— Hush'd is their blithesome carolling! Their rest is where their song hath been— They sleep upon each fading flower Ah! sorrow's eye can show no scene More welcome than pale twilight's hour! The dying sun—the dying sun!— Oh, sorrow loves its failing light— It breathes a kindred glow upon The breast, wrapt in the gloom of night— Pale sorrow loves the wither'd spray— The flowers o'er which the blight hath past;— These speak of raptures past away,— Of cherish'd joys too bright to last! What though the wild-bird's loved retreat Gives back no more their warblings dear;— The strain of gladness is not meet For sorrow's lone and tuneless ear!— Better to list the breeze of night O'er each sere leaf and dying flower;— Ah! earth can show no sadder sight Than meets the eye at twilight hour! THE LAMENT. Give not to me the wreath of green— The blooming vase of flowers;— They breathe of joy that once hath been;— Of gone and faded hours!— I cannot love the rose, though rich— Its beauty will not last;— Give me, give me the bloom, o'er which The early blight hath pass'd; The yellow buds—give them to rest, On my cold brow and joyless breast, Where life is failing fast! Take far from me the wine-cup bright, In hours of revelry; It suits glad brows, and bosoms light— It is not meet for me; Oh, I can pledge the heart no more I pledged in days gone by; Sorrow hath touch'd my bosom's core, And I am left to die; Give me to drink of Lethe's wave— Give me the lone and silent grave, O'er which the night-winds sigh! Wake not, upon my tuneless ear Soft music's stealing strain; It cannot soothe—it cannot cheer My anguish'd heart again: But place the Æolian harp upon The tomb of her, I love;— There, when heaven shrouds the dying sun, My weary steps will rove, As o'er its chords night pours its breath, To list the serenade of death, Her silent bourne above! Give me to seek the lonely tomb, Where sleeps the sainted dead, Now the pale nightfall throws its gloom Above the narrow bed; There, while the winds which sweep along, O'er the harp-strings are driven, And the funereal soul of song Upon the air is given; Oh let my faint and parting breath Be mingled with that song of death, And flee with it to heaven! FADED HOURS. Oh! for my bright and faded hours When life was like a summer stream, On whose gay banks the virgin flowers Blush'd in the morning's rosy beam; Or danced upon the breeze that bare Its store of rich perfume along, While the wood-robin pour'd on air The ravishing delights of song. The sun look'd from his lofty cloud, While flow'd its sparkling waters fair— And went upon his path-way proud, And threw a brighter lustre there; And smiled upon the golden heaven, And on the earth's sweet loveliness, Where light, and joy, and song were given, The glad and fairy scene to bless! Ah! these were bright and joyous hours, When youth awoke from boyhood's dream, To see life's Eden dress'd in flowers, While young hope bask'd in morning's beam! And proffer'd thanks to heaven above, While glow'd his fond and grateful breast, Who spread for him that scene of love And made him so supremely blest! That scene of love!—where hath it gone? Where have its charms and beauty sped? My hours of youth, that o'er me shone— Where have their light and splendor fled? Into the silent lapse of years— And I am left on earth to mourn: And I am left! to drop my tears O'er memory's lone and icy urn! Yet why pour forth the voice of wail O'er feeling's blighted coronal? Ere many gorgeous suns shall fail, I shall be gather'd in my pall; Oh, my dark hours on earth are few— My hopes are crush'd, my heart is riven;— And I shall soon bid life adieu, To seek enduring joys in heaven! MARY A. BROOKS. ZOPHIEL. Sephora held her to her heart, the while Grief had its way—then saw her gently laid, And bade her, kissing her blue eyes, beguile, Slumbering, the fervid noon. Her leafy bed Sigh'd forth o'erpowering breath, increased the heat; Sleepless had been the night; her weary sense Could now no more. Lone in the still retreat, Wounding the flowers to sweetness more intense, She sank. 'T is thus, kind Nature lets our wo Swell till it bursts forth from the o'erfraught breast; Then draws an opiate from the bitter flow, And lays her sorrowing child soft in the lap of rest. Now all the mortal maid lies indolent, Save one sweet cheek which the cool velvet turf Had touch'd too rude, though all with blooms besprent, One soft arm pillow'd. Whiter than the surf That foams against the sea-rock, look'd her neck, By the dark, glossy, odorous shrubs relieved, That close inclining o'er her seem'd to reck What 't was they canopied; and quickly heaved Beneath her robe's white folds and azure zone, Her heart yet incomposed; a fillet through Peep'd brightly azure, while with tender moan As if of bliss, Zephyr her ringlets blew Sportive;—about her neck their gold he twined, Kiss'd the soft violet on her temples warm, And eyebrow—just so dark might well define Its flexile arch;—throne of expression's charm. As the vex'd Caspian, though its rage be past And the blue smiling heavens swell o'er in peace, Shook to the centre, by the recent blast, Heaves on tumultuous still, and hath not power to cease— So still each little pulse was seen to throb Though passion and its pains were lull'd to rest, And “ever and anon” a piteous sob Shook the pure arch expansive o'er her breast. Save that 't was all tranquillity; that reign'd O'er fragrance, sound and beauty; all was mute— Save where a dove her dear one's absence plain'd And the faint breeze mourn'd o'er the slumberer's lute. It chanced, that day, lured by the verdure, came Zophiel, now minister of ill; but ere He sinn'd, a heavenly angel. The faint flame Of dying embers, on an altar, where Raguel, fair Egla's sire, in secret vow'd And sacrificed to the sole living God, Where friendless shades the sacred rites enshroud;— The fiend beheld and knew; his soul was awed, And he bethought him of the forfeit joys Once his in heaven;—deep in a darkling grot He sat him down;—the melancholy noise Of leaf and creeping vine accordant with his thought. When fiercer spirits howl'd, he but complain'd Ere yet 't was his to roam the pleasant earth, His heaven-invented harp he still retain'd Though tuned to bliss no more; and had its birth Of him, beneath some black infernal clift The first drear song of wo; and torment wrung The spirit less severe where he might lift His plaining voice—and frame the like as now he sung: “Wo to thee, wild ambition, I employ Despair's dull notes thy dread effects to tell, Born in high heaven, her peace thou couldst destroy, And, but for thee, there had not been a hell. “Through the celestial domes thy clarion peal'd,— Angels, entranced, beneath thy banners ranged, And straight were fiends;—hurl'd from the shrinking field, They waked in agony to wail the change. “Darting through all her veins the subtile fire The world's fair mistress first inhaled thy breath, To lot of higher beings learn'd to aspire,— Dared to attempt—and doom'd the world to death. “Thy thousand wild desires, that still torment The fiercely struggling soul, where peace once dwelt, But perish'd;—feverish hope—drear discontent, Impoisoning all possest—Oh! I have felt “As spirits feel—yet not for man we mourn Scarce o'er the silly bird in state were he, That builds his nest, loves, sings the morn's return, And sleeps at evening; save by aid of thee, “Fame ne'er had roused, nor song her records kept The gem, the ore, the marble breathing life, The pencil's colors,—all in earth had slept, Now see them mark with death his victim's strife. “Man found thee death—but death and dull decay Baffling, by aid of thee, his mastery proves;— By mighty works he swells his narrow day, And reigns, for ages, on the world he loves. “Yet what the price? with stings that never cease Thou goad'st him on; and when, too keen the smart He fain would pause awhile—and sighs for peace, Food thou wilt have, or tear his victim heart.” Thus Zophiel still,—“though now the infernal crew Had gain'd by sin a privilege in the world, Allay'd their torments in the cool night dew, And by the dim star-light again their wings unfurl'd.” And now, regretful of the joys his birth Had promised; deserts, mounts and streams he crost, To find, amid the loveliest spots of earth, Faint likeness of the heaven he had lost. And oft, by unsuccessful searching pain'd, Weary he fainted through the toilsome hours; And then his mystic nature he sustain'd On steam of sacrifices—breath of flowers. Sometimes he gave out oracles, amused With mortal folly; resting on the shrines; Or, all in some fair Sibyl's form infused, Spoke from her quivering lips, or penn'd her mystic lines. And now he wanders on from glade to glade To where more precious shrubs diffuse their balms, And gliding through the thick inwoven shade Where the young Hebrew lay in all her charms, He caught a glimpse. The colors in her face— Her bare white arms—her lips—her shining hair— Burst on his view. He would have flown the place; Fearing some faithful angel rested there, Who 'd see him—rest of glory—lost to bliss— Wandering and miserably panting—fain To glean a scanty joy—with thoughts like this— Came all he 'd known and lost—he writhed with pain Ineffable—But what assail'd his ear, A sigh?—surprised, another glance he took; Then doubting—fearing—gradual coming near— He ventured to her side and dared to look; Whispering, “yes, 't is of earth! So, new-found life Refreshing, look'd sweet Eve, with purpose fell When first sin's sovereign gazed on her, and strife Had with his heart, that grieved with arts of hell, “Stern as it was, to win her o'er to death!— Most beautiful of all in earth, in heaven, Oh! could I quaff for aye that fragrant breath, Couldst thou, or being likening thee, be given “To bloom for ever for me thus—still true To one dear theme, my full soul flowing o'er, Would find no room for thought of what it knew— Nor picturing forfeit transport, curse me more. “But oh! severest pain!—I cannot be In what I love, blest even the little span— (With all a spirit's keen capacity For bliss) permitted the poor insect man. “The few I 've seen and deem'd of worth to win Like some sweet floweret mildew'd, in my arms, Wither'd to hideousness—foul even as sin— Grew fearful hags; and then with potent charm “Of mutter'd word and harmful drug, did learn To force me to their will. Down the damp grave Loathing, I went at Endor, and uptorn Brought back the dead; when tortured Saul did crave. “To view his pending fate. Fair—nay, as this Young slumberer, that dread witch; when, I array'd In lovely shape, to meet my guileful kiss She yielded first her lip. And thou, sweet maid— What 's it I see?—a recent tear has stray'd And left its stain upon her cheek of bliss.— “She 's fallen to sleep in grief—haply been chid, Or by rude mortal wrong'd. So let it prove Meet for thy purpose: 'mid these blossoms hid, I'll gaze; and when she wakes, with all that love “And art can lend, come forth. He who would gain A fond full heart, in love's soft surgery skill'd, Should seek it when 't is sore; allay its pain— With balm by pity prest 't is all his own;—so heal'd, “She may be mine a little year—even fair And sweet as now—Oh! respite! while possest I lose the dismal sense of my despair— But then—I will not think upon the rest. “And wherefore grieve to cloud her little day Of fleeting life?—What doom from power divine I bear eternal! thoughts of ruth, away! Wake pretty fly!—and—while thou mayst,—be mine. “Though but an hour—so thou suppliest thy looms With shining silk, and in the cruel snare Seest the fond bird entrapp'd, but for his plumes To work thy robes, or twine amidst thy hair.”. EDWARD COATE PINKNEY ITALY. Know'st thou the land which lovers ought to choose? Like blessings there descend the sparkling dews; In gleaming streams the crystal rivers run, The purple vintage clusters in the sun; Odors of flowers haunt the balmy breeze, Rich fruits hang high upon the verdant trees; And vivid blossoms gem the shady groves Where bright-plumed birds discourse their careless loves. Beloved!—speed we from this sullen strand Until thy light feet press that green shore's yellow sand. Look seaward thence, and nought shall meet thine eye But fairy isles like paintings on the sky; And, flying fast and free before the gale, The gaudy vessel with its glancing sail; And waters glittering in the glare of noon, Or flecked with broken lines of crimson light When the far fisher's fire affronts the night. Lovely as loved! towards that smiling shore Bear we our household gods, to fix for ever more. It looks a dimple on the face of earth, The seal of beauty, and the shrine of mirth; Nature is delicate and graceful there, The place of genius, feminine and fair; The winds are awed, nor dare to breathe aloud; The air seems never to have borne a cloud, Save where volcanoes send to heaven their curled And solemn smokes, like altars of the world. Thrice beautiful! to that delightful spot Carry our married hearts, and be all pain forgot. There Art, too, shows, when Nature's beauty palls, Her sculptured marbles, and her pictured walls; And there are forms in which they both conspire To whisper themes that know not how to tire: The speaking ruins in that gentle clime Have but been hallowed by the hand of Time, And each can mutely prompt some thought of flame —The meanest stone is not without a name. Then come, beloved!—hasten o'er the sea To build our happy hearth in blooming Italy. A HEALTH. I fill this cup to one made up of loveliness alone, A woman, of her gentle sex the seeming paragon; To whom the better elements and kindly stars have given A form so fair, that like the air, 't is less of earth than heaven. Her every tone is music's own, like those of morning birds, And something more than melody dwells ever in her words; The coinage of her heart are they, and from her lips each flows As one may see the burthen'd bee forth issue from the rose. Affections are as thoughts to her, the measure of her hours; Her feelings have the fragrancy, the freshness, of young flowers; And lonely passions, changing oft, so fill her, she appears The image of themselves by turns,—the idol of past years! Of her bright face one glance will trace a picture on the brain, And of her voice in echoing hearts a round must long remain, But memory such as mine of her so very much endears, When death is nigh, my latest sigh will not be life's, but hers. I fill this cup to one made up of loveliness alone, A woman, of her gentle sex the seeming paragon— Her health! and would on earth there stood some more of such a frame, That life might be all poetry, and weariness a name. SONG. We break the glass, whose sacred wine To some beloved health we drain, Lest future pledges, less divine, Should e'er the hallow'd toy profane; And thus I broke a heart that poured Its tide of feeling out for thee, In draughts, by after-times deplored, Yet dear to memory. But still the old impassion'd ways And habits of my mind remain, And still unhappy light displays Thine image chamber'd in my brain. And still it looks as when the hours Went by like flights of singing birds, On that soft chain of spoken flowers, And airy gems, thy words. A PICTURE SONG. How may this little tablet feign the features of a face, Which o'er-informs with loveliness its proper share of space; Or human hands on ivory enable us to see The charms, that all must wonder at, thou work of gods, in thee! But yet, methinks, that sunny smile familiar stories tells, And I should know those placid eyes, two shaded crystal wells; Nor can my soul, the limner's art attesting with a sigh, Forget the blood that deck'd thy cheek, as rosy clouds the sky. They could not semble what thou art, more excellent than fair, As soft as sleep or pity is, and pure as mountain air; But here are common, earthly hues, to such an aspect wrought, That none, save thine, can seem so like the beautiful of thought. The song I sing, thy likeness like, is painful mimicry Of something better, which is now a memory to me, Who have upon life's frozen sea arrived the icy spot, Where men's magnetic feelings show their guiding task forgot. The sportive hopes that used to chase their shifting shadows on, Like children playing in the sun, are gone—for ever gone; And on a careless, sullen peace, my double-fronted mind, Like Janus, when his gates are shut, looks forward and behind. Apollo placed his harp, of old, awhile upon a stone, Which has resounded since, when struck, a breaking harp string's tone; And thus my heart, though wholly now from early softness free, If touch'd, will yield the music yet, it first received of thee. JOHN NEAL THE EAGLE. There's a fierce gray bird—with a sharpen'd beak; With an angry eye, and a startling shriek: That nurses her brood where the cliff-flowers blow, On the precipice-top—in perpetual snow— Where the fountains are mute, or in secrecy flow— That sits—where the air is shrill and bleak, On the splinter'd point of a shiver'd peak— Where the weeds lie close—and the grass sings sharp, To a comfortless tune—like a wintry harp— Bald-headed and stripp'd!—like a vulture torn In wind and strife!—with her feathers worn, And ruffled and stain'd—while scattering—bright, Round her serpent-neck—that is writhing, bare— Is a crimson collar of gleaming hair!— Like the crest of a warrior thinn'd in the fight, And shorn—and bristling—see her! where She sits in the glow of the sun-bright air! With wing half-poised—and talons bleeding— And kindling eye—as if her prey Had—suddenly—been snatch'd away— While she was tearing it, and feeding! A Bird that is first to worship the sun, When he gallops in flame—'t ill the cloud tides run In billows of fire—as his course is done: Above where the fountain is gushing in light; Above where the torrent is forth in its might— Like an imprison'd blaze that is bursting from night! Or a lion that springs—with a roar—from his lair! Bounding off—all in foam—from the echoing height— Like a rank of young war-horses—terribly bright, Their manes all erect!—and their hoofs in the air! The earth shaking under them—trumpets on high— And banners unfurling away in the sky— With the neighing of steeds! and the streaming of hair Above where the silvery flashing is seen— The striping of waters, that skip o'er the green, And soft, spongy moss, where the fairies have been, Bending lovely and bright in the young Morning's eye Like ribands of flame—or the bow of the sky: Above that dark torrent—above the bright stream— The gay ruddy fount, with the changeable gleam, Where the lustre of heaven eternally plays— The voice may be heard—of the thunderer's bird, Calling out to her god in a clear, wild scream, As she mounts to his throne, and unfolds in his beam; While her young are laid out in his rich red blaze; And their winglets are fledged in his hottest rays: Proud bird of the cliff! where the barren-yew springs— Where the sunshine stays—and the wind-harp sings, Where the heralds of battle sit—pluming their wings— A scream! she 's awake!—over hill-top and flood, A crimson light runs!—like the gushing of blood— Over valley and rock!—over mountain and wood That bird is abroad—in the van of her brood! The Bird that laves Her sounding pinions in the sun's first gush— Drinks his meridian blaze and sunset flush: Worships her idol in his fiercest hour: Bathes her full bosom in his hottest shower: Sits amid stirring stars, and bends her beak, Like the slipp'd falcon—when her piercing shriek Tells that she stoops upon her cleaving wing, To drink anew some victim's clear-red spring. That monarch Bird! that slumbers in the night Upon the lofty air-peak's utmost height: Or sleeps upon the wing—amid the ray Of steady—cloudless—everlasting day! Rides with the Thunderer in his blazing march: And bears his lightnings o'er yon boundless arch. Soars wheeling through the storm, and screams away Where the young pinions of the morning play. BATTLE OF NIAGARA. THE SOLDIER'S VISIT TO HIS FAMILY. And there the stranger stays: beneath that oak. Whose shatter'd majesty hath felt the stroke Of heaven's own thunder—yet it proudly heaves A giant sceptre wreathed with blasted leaves— As though it dared the elements, and stood The guardian of that cot—the monarch of that wood. Beneath its venerable vault he stands: And one might think, who saw his outstretch'd hands, That something more than soldiers e'er may feel, Had touch'd him with its holy, calm appeal: That yonder wave—the heaven—the earth—the air Had call'd upon his spirit for her prayer. His eye goes dimly o'er the midnight scene: The oak—the cot—the wood—the faded green— The moon—the sky—the distant moving light— All! all are gathering on his dampen'd sight. His warrior-helm and plume, his fresh-dyed blade Beneath a window, on the turf are laid; The panes are ruddy through the clambering vines And blushing leaves, that Summer intertwines In warmer tints than e'er luxuriant Spring, O'er flower-embosom'd roof led wandering. His pulses quicken—for a rude old door Is open'd by the wind: he sees the floor Strew'd with white sand, on which he used to trace His boyhood's battles—and assign a place To charging hosts—and give the Indian yell— And shout to hear his hoary grandsire tell, How he had fought with savages, whose breath He felt upon his cheek like mildew till his death. Hark!—that sweet song!—how full of tenderness! O, who would breathe in this voluptuous press Of lulling thoughts!—so soothing and so low; Like singing fountains in their faintest flow— It is as if some holy—lovely thing, Within our very hearts were murmuring. The soldier listens, and his arms are prest In thankfulness, and trembling on his breast: Now—on the very window where he stands Are seen a clambering infant's rosy hands: And now—ah heaven!—blessings on that smile!— Stay, soldier stay—O, linger yet awhile! An airy vision now appears, with eyes— As tender as the blue of weeping skies: Yet sunny in their radiance, as that blue When sunset glitters on its falling dew: With form—all joy and dance—as bright and free As youthful nymph of mountain Liberty: Or naked angels dreamt by poesy: A blooming infant to her heart is prest; And ah—a mother's song is lulling it to rest! A youthful mother! God of heaven! A thing beneath the skies, so holy or so fair! A single bound! our chief is standing by Trembling from head to foot with ecstacy— “Bless thee!” at length he murmur'd—“bless thee, love! “My wife!—my boy:”—Their eyes are raised above. His soldier's tread of sounding strength is gone: A choking transport drowns his manly tone. He sees the closing of that mild, blue eye, His bosom echoes to a faint low cry: His glorious boy springs freshly from his sleep; Shakes his thin sun-curls, while his eye-beams leap As half in fear, along the stranger's dress, Then, half advancing, yields to his caress:— Then, peers beneath his locks, and seeks his eye With the clear look of radiant infancy, The cherub smile of love, the azure of the sky. The stranger now is kneeling by the side Of that young mother,—watching for the tide Of her returning life:—it comes—a glow Goes—faintly—slowly—o'er her cheek and brow: A rising of the gauze that lightly shrouds A snowy breast—like twilight's melting clouds— In nature's pure, still eloquence, betrays The feelings of the heart that reels beneath his gaze. She lives! she lives—see how her feelings speak, Through what transparency of eye and cheek! Her color comes and goes, like that faint ray, That flits o'er lilies at the close of day. O, nature, how omnipotent!—that sigh— That youthful mother in her ecstacy, Feels but the wandering of a husband's eye. Her lip now ripens, and her heaving breast Throbs wildly in its light, and now subsides to rest. 'T is dark abroad. The majesty of night Bows down superbly from her utmost height: Stretches her starless plumes across the world; And all the banners of the wind are furl'd. How heavily we breathe amid such gloom! As if we slumber'd in creation's tomb. It is the noon of that tremendous hour, When life is helpless, and the dead have power: When solitudes are peopled: when the sky Is swept by shady wings that, sailing by, Proclaim their watch is set; when hidden rills Are chirping on their course; and all the hills Are bright with armor:—when the starry vests And glittering plumes, and fiery twinkling crests Of moon-light sentinels, are sparkling round, And all the air is one rich floating sound: When countless voices, in the day unheard, Are piping from their haunts: and every bird That loves the leafy wood, and blooming bower, And echoing cave, is singing to her flower: When every lovely—every lonely place, Is ringing to the light and sandal'd pace Of twinkling feet; and all about, the flow Of new-born fountains murmuring as they go: When watery tunes are richest—and the call Of wandering streamlets, as they part and fall In foaming melody, is all around: Like fairy harps beneath enchanted ground, Sweet drowsy distant music! like the breath Of airy flutes that blow before an infant's death. It is that hour when listening ones will weep And know not why: when we would gladly sleep Our last—last sleep; and feel no touch of fear,— Unconscious where we are—or what is near, Till we are startled by a falling tear, That unexpected gather'd in our eye, While we were panting for yon blessed sky: That hour of gratitude—of whispering prayer, When we can hear a worship in the air: When we are lifted from the earth, and feel Light fanning wings around us faintly wheel, And o'er our lids and brow a blessing steal: And then—as if our sins were all forgiven— And all our tears were wiped—and we in heaven It is that hour of quiet ecstacy, When every ruffling wind, that passes by The sleeping leaf, makes busiest minstrelsy; When all at once! amid the quivering shade, Millions of diamond sparklers are betray'd! When dry leaves rustle, and the whistling song Of keen-tuned grass, comes piercingly along: When windy pipes are heard—and many a lute Is touch'd amid the skies, and then is mute: When even the foliage on the glittering steep, Of feathery bloom—is whispering in its sleep: When all the garlands of the precipice, Shedding their blossoms, in their moonlight bliss, Are floating loosely on the eddying air, And breathing out their fragrant spirits there: And all their braided tresses fluttering—bright, Are sighing faintly to the shadowy light: When every cave and grot—and bower and lake, And drooping floweret-bell, are all awake: When starry eyes are burning on the cliff Of many a crouching tyrant too, as if Such melodies were grateful even to him: When life is loveliest—and the blue skies swim In lustre, warm as sunshine—but more dim: When all the holy sentinels of night Step forth to watch in turn, and worship by their light. Such is the hour!—the holy, breathless hour, When such sweet minstrelsy hath mightiest power; When sights are seen, that all the blaze of day Can never rival, in its fierce display: Such is the hour—yet not a sound is heard; No sights are seen—no melancholy bird Sings tenderly and sweet; but all the air Is thick and motionless—as if it were A prelude to some dreadful tragedy; Some midnight drama of an opening sky! The genius of the mountain, and the wood; The stormy eagle, and her rushing brood; The fire-eyed tenant of the desert cave; The gallant spirit of the roaring wave; The star-crown'd messengers that ride the air; The meteor watch-light, with its streamy hair, Threatening and sweeping redly from the hill; The shaking cascade—and the merry rill Are hush'd to slumber now—and heaven and earth are still. And now the day-light comes:—slowly it rides, In ridgy lustre o'er the cloudy tides, Like the soft foam upon the billow's breast; Or feathery light upon a shadowy crest; The morning breezes from their slumbers wake, And o'er the distant hill-tops cheerly shake Their dewy locks, and plume themselves, and poise Their rosy wings, and listen to the noise Of echoes wandering from the world below: The distant lake, rejoicing in its flow: The bugle's ready cry: the laboring drum: The neigh of steeds—and the incessant hum That the bright tenants of the forest send: The sunrise gun: the heave—the wave—and bend Of everlasting trees, whose busy leaves Rustle their song of praise, while ruin weaves A robe of verdure for their yielding bark; While mossy garlands—rich, and full, and dark, Creep slowly round them. Monarchs of the wood! Whose mighty spectres sway the mountain brood! Whose aged bosoms, in their last decay, Shelter the wing'd idolators of day; Who, 'mid the desert wild, sublimely stand, And grapple with the storm-god hand to hand! Then drop like weary pyramids away; Stupendous monuments of calm decay! As yet the warring thunders have not rent The swimming clouds, the brightening firmament, The lovely mists that float around the sky— Ruddy and rich with fresh and glorious dye, Like hovering seraph wings—or robe of poesy! Now comes the sun forth! not in blaze of fire: With rainbow-harness'd coursers, that respire An atmosphere of flame. No chariot whirls O'er reddening clouds. No sunny flag unfurls O'er rushing smoke. No chargers in array Scatter through heaven and earth their fiery spray. No shouting charioteer, in transport flings Ten thousand anthems, from tumultuous strings: And round and round, no fresh-plumed echoes dance: No airy minstrels in the flush light glance: No rushing melody comes strong and deep: And far away no fading winglets sweep: No boundless hymning o'er the blue sky rings, In hallelujahs to the King of kings: No youthful hours are seen. No riband lash, Flings its gay stripings like a rainbow flash, While starry crowns, and constellations fade Before the glories of that cavalcade, Whose trappings are the jewelry of heaven, Embroider'd thickly on the clouds of even. No!—no!—he comes not thus in pomp, and light! A new creation bursting out of night! But he comes darkly forth! in storm array'd— Like the red tempest marshall'd in her shade, When mountains rock; and thunders travelling round, Hold counsel in the sky—and midnight trumps resound. GOLDAU. Switzerland! my country! 'tis to thee, I rock my harp in agony:— My country! nurse of Liberty, Home of the gallant, great and free, My sullen harp I rock to thee. O, I have lost ye all Parents—and home—and friends: Ye sleep beneath a mountain pall; A mountain-plumage o'er ye bends. The cliff-yew in funereal gloom, Is now the only mourning plume, That nods above a people's tomb. Of the echoes that swim o'er thy bright blue lake, And deep in its caverns, their merry bells shake; And repeat thy young huntsman's cry: That clatter and laugh, when the goatherds take Their browsing flocks at the morning's break, Far over the hills—not one is awake In the swell of thy peaceable sky. They sit on that wave with a motionless wing; And their cymbals are mute and the desert birds sing Their unanswer'd notes to the wave and the sky— One startling, and sudden—unchangeable cry— As they stoop their broad wing, and go sluggishly by: For deep in that blue-bosom'd water is laid As innocent, true, and as lovely a maid As ever in cheerfulness carol'd her song, In the blithe mountain air, as she bounded along: The heavens are all blue, and the billow's bright verge Is frothily laved by a whispering surge, That heaves incessant, a tranquil dirge, To lull the pale forms that sleep below: Forms—that rock as the waters flow. That bright lake is still as a liquid sky, And when o'er its bosom the swift clouds fly, They pass like thoughts o'er a clear blue eye! The fringe of thin foam that their sepulchre binds, Is as light as a cloud that is borne by the winds; While over its bosom the dim vapors hover, And flutterless skims the snowy-wing'd plover: Swiftly passing away—like a haunted wing; With a drooping plume—that may not fling One sound of life—or a rustling note— O'er that sleepless tomb—where my loved ones float. Oh cool and fresh is that bright blue lake, While over its stillness no sounds awake: No sights—but those of the hill-top fountain That swims on the height of a cloud-wrapp'd mountain— The basin of the rainbow-stream, The sunset gush—the morning gleam— The picture of the poet's dream. Land of proud hearts! where freedom broods Amid her home of echoing woods, The mother of the mountain floods— Dark, Goldau is thy vale; The spirits of Rigi shall wail On their cloud-bosom'd deep, as they sail In mist where thy children are lying— As their thunders once paused in their headlong descent, And delay'd their discharge—while thy desert was rent With the cries of thy sons who were dying. No chariots of fire on the clouds career'd; No warrior-arm, with its falchion rear'd:— No death-angel's trump o'er the ocean was blown; No mantle of wrath o'er the heaven was thrown; No armies of light—with their banners of flame— Or neighing steeds—through the sunset came, Or leaping from space appear'd! No earthquakes reel'd—no Thunderer storm'd; No fetterless dead o'er the bright sky swarm'd; No voices in heaven were heard! But the hour when the sun in his pride went down While his parting hung rich o'er the world: While abroad o'er the sky his flush mantle was blown, And his red-rushing streamers unfurl'd;— An everlasting hill was torn From its eternal base—and borne— In gold and crimson vapors drest To where—a people are at rest! Slowly it came in its mountain wrath, And the forests vanish'd before its path: And the rude cliffs bow'd—and the waters fled— And the living were buried, while over their head They heard the full march of their foe as he sped— And the valley of life—was the tomb of the dead! The clouds were all bright: no lightnings flew: And over that valley no death-blast blew: No storm pass'd by on his cloudy wing: No twang was heard from the sky-archer's string— But the dark, dim hill in its strength came down, While the shedding of day on its summit was thrown, A glory all light, like a wind-wreathed crown— While the tame bird flew to the vulture's nest, And the vulture forbore in that hour to molest.— The mountain sepulchre of all I loved! The village sank—and the monarch trees Lean'd back from the encountering breeze— While this tremendous pageant moved! The mountain forsook his perpetual throne— Came down from his rock—and his path is shown In barrenness and ruin—where The secret of his power lies bare— His rocks in nakedness arise: His desolation mocks the skies. THE BIRTH OF A POET. On a blue summer night, While the stars were asleep, Like gems of the deep, In their own drowsy light; While the newly mown hay On the green earth lay, And all that came near it went scented away; From a lone woody place, There looked out a face, With large blue eyes, Like the wet warm skies, Brimful of water and light; A profusion of hair Flashing out on the air, And a forehead alarmingly bright: 'T was the head of a poet! He grew As the sweet strange flowers of the wilderness grow, In the dropping of natural dew, Unheeded—alone— Till his heart had blown— As the sweet strange flowers of the wilderness blow; Till every thought wore a changeable stain Like flower-leaves wet with the sunset rain: A proud and passionate boy was he, Like all the children of Poesy; With a haughty look and a haughty tread, And something awful about his head; With wonderful eyes Full of wo and surprise, Like the eyes of them that can see the dead Looking about, For a moment or two, he stood On the shore of the mighty wood; Then ventured out, With a bounding step and a joyful shout, The brave sky bending o'er him! The broad sea all before him! AMBITION. I loved to hear the war-horn cry, And panted at the drum's deep roll; And held my breath, when—flaming high— I saw our starry banners fly, As challenging the haughty sky, They went like battle o'er my soul: For I was so ambitious then, I burn'd to be the slave—of men. I stood and saw the morning light, A standard swaying far and free, And loved it like the conqu'ring flight Of angels floating wide and bright Above the stars, above the fight Where nations warr'd for liberty. And thought I heard the battle cry Of trumpets in the hollow sky. I sail'd upon the dark-blue deep: And shouted to the eaglet soaring; And hung me from a rocking steep, When all but spirits were asleep; And oh, my very soul would leap To hear the gallant waters roaring; For every sound and shape of strife To me, was but the breath of life. But, I am strangely alter'd now— I love no more the bugle voice— The rushing wave—the plunging prow— The mountain with his clouded brow— The thunder when his blue skies bow, And all the sons of God rejoice— I love to dream of tears and sighs And shadowy hair and half-shut eyes. THE SLEEPER. WRITTEN THE DAY AFTER THE FUNERAL OF BYRON. I stood above the sea. I heard the roar Of waters far below me. On the shore A warrior-ship, with all her banners torn, Her broad sails flying loose, lay overborne By tumbling surges. She had swept the main, Braved the loud thunder—stood the hurricane; To be, when all her danger was o'erpast, Upon her native shore, in wreck and ruin cast. I thought of Greece—the proud one dead; Struck—with his heart in flower; Wreck'd—with his bright wings all outspread, In his descent, From that forbidden firmament, O'er which he went, Like some Archangel in his power: The everlasting ocean lay Below my weary eyes; While overhead there roll'd away The everlasting skies: A thousand birds around me flew, Emerging from the distant blue, Like spirits from the summer deep,— Then, wheeling slowly, one by one, All disappearing in the sun, They left me—and I fell asleep: But soon a loud, strong trumpet blew, And by, an armed angel flew, With tresses all on fire, and wings of color'd flame: And then the thunder broke About me, and I woke— And heard a voice above proclaim The warrior-poet's name! The island bard! that came Far from his home, to die In martyrdom to Liberty: I started—wonder'd—where was I?— Above me roll'd a Grecian sky; Around me Grecian isles were spread, O'erpeopled with great shadowy dead, Assembled there to celebrate Some awful rite: Again the iron trump was blown With overpowering might; And lo! upon a rocky throne, Appear'd a dead man that I knew; His hair unbound, his forehead wet with dew, And then the angel, standing o'er him, said This incantation, with her wings outspread. INCANTATION. Bard of the ocean, wake! The midnight skies Of solid blue, That roll away above thee, shed O'er thy unshelter'd head A most untimely dew! Wake, Sleeper, wake! Arise! And from thy marble forehead shake The shadow of the dead! Arise! Arise! Thou last of all the Giants! Tear Thy silken robes away— Shake off the wine-dew from thy hair— The crush'd and faded roses there, And let it play, A glittering shadow on the air,— Like the young Spartan's when he set His foot—and met The Persian in array: Byron, awake! Stand up and take Thy natural shape upon thee! bare Thy bosom to the winds that blow— Not over bowers, Heavy with scented flowers— But over drifted snow; Not o'er the perfumed earth, Sweltering in moonlight rain, Where even the blossoms that have birth. Breathe on the heavens a stain— But o'er the rude, Cold Grecian solitude: Up, Byron, up! with eyes Dark as Egyptian skies, Where men may read their destinies! Up! in thy golden panoply complete Transfigured—all prepared to meet The Moslem foe! What! still unmoved, thou Sleeper! still Untroubled by the sounds that fill Thy agitated air! Thy forehead set— Thy bosom wet— Still undisturbed! Thy proud lip curb'd— The death-dew on thy hair! Awake thee, Byron! Thou art call'd, Thou man of power! to break The thraldom of the nations—wake! Arise! The heathen are upon thee! Lo, they come Without a flute, or bell, or drum, Silent as death, Holding their breath; Appall'd— Like them of old, that crept On the shorn Samson, while he slept, In their barbarian power afraid Of one—a woman had betray'd! Or, like the pirate-band that stole The sleeping God of wine; Each, as he came, through all his soul, Thrilling with awe divine,— An armed multitude, to take A giant by surprise: Awake, anointed one, awake! The awful sky Is full of lamentation—all the air With sweet, remote, Low sounds, afloat— And solemn trumpeting and prayer. And lo! The waters of the mountain lake O'ershadow'd by the flowery wood, Tremble and shake— And change their hue Of quiet blue, As if they felt a spirit go O'er their transparent solitude: The great hills darken—all the valleys quake With one continual throe,— The green earth is wet With a fragrant sweat, Like the fine small dew, That filters through Rich moss, by the foot subdued; And the olive trees there Their blossoms throw On the motionless air, Like a shower of snow, Perpetually— Trembling as if they felt the tread Of the stout invisible dead— The buried nations of all the earth— All struggling upward into birth, To subterranean melody: And see! another band appear, Unarm'd with helm, or sword, or spear, Or buckler, guard, or shield; A band of giants! on they go, Each—by himself—to meet the foe, Alone in yonder field: Three hundred Spartan shadows they I know them by their flying hair, Rejoicing as it floats away, A lustre on the troubled air: Behold! they gather round The marble Sleeper, where he lies Reposing on the scented ground,— His head with dripping roses bound— A shadow in his eyes: Behold them slowly trace, With sorrow in each noble face, The print of naked feet about the holy place: Awake! awake! Thou sleeping warrior-Bard! O break Thy trance profound! The Spartans are about thee— They will not go without thee— Awake! They claim thee for the last Of all that valiant race; The Grecians of the past,— To whom the battle and the chase, The war-ship tumbling to the blast, The stormy night, The thunder and the fight, Were pastime and repose? Up, then, and take thy stand Amid the shadowy band! Outspread thy banner o'er them, Go, as thou should'st, before them; Hear thou their call, Awake! and fall Like the bright thunder on their foes! On with thy helmet! set thy foot Where'er thou art— Strike down the infidel, and put Thy mailed hand upon thy slumbering heart, Or on the nearest altar, where, Unstain'd with revel, blood, or wine, Stands many an everlasting shrine, Wrapp'd in perpetual cloud, For ever echoing loud, And sounding to the mountain air, With voices wild, remote, and high, Like fanes of ancient prophecy— Built by the cherubim, of solid rock, Into the broad blue heaven—to mock The thunder and the Moslem shock— The armies of the earth and sky! O Thou! Of steadfast eye, And cold, intrepid brow, Whose marble amplitude Is frightful now, There is thy place of worship—there! And this the hour! Go up, thou Sleeper! go with loosen'd hair; Go up into the cloud, and then forbear To join the awful interlude, The wild and solemn harmony Of that afflicted solitude, Bard of the Ocean, if thou canst, in one eternal prayer! What! Still changing not, Still motionless and pale, And damp, and cold, Unmoved by trumpet, prayer, or song, The stirring gale, Or noise of coming strife, Or thunder near thee roll'd: The nations that have known thee long Unheeded marching by, Where thou art lying; The Spartan wise—the Spartan strong, Scared women with their garments flying, As if pursued By some great multitude— Young children all about thee crying, And thou, alone, Immoveable as if—thy blood were turn'd to stone! Why! what art thou, Man of the solid brow; O what! To alter not, Nor change, nor stir thyself, nor wake, Though all the nations try to break Thy trance profound! Nay, though they altogether take The place of supplication round The silent spot, The cold extinguished ground, Where thou art now, Until They overcast Thy spirit, Sleeper, with a last And most awakening spell— A spell of power and sorcery For all that dwell Beneath the water or the sky Or fill The vaulted mystery, That silent flies For ever o'er our upturn'd eyes— Showering the dew Like a shower of light From the beautiful blue Of a beautiful night: Up, then, awake! Up from thy charmed slumber! break Thy long and sorrowful trance! Now! Now! Advance! Ye of the snowy brow, Each in her overpowering splendor! The young and great, Superb and desolate, The beautiful and tender! Advance! Ye shadows of his child and wife, And thrill the sleeper into life! Now heaven be thanked! he lies Regardless of our cries. Rejoice! Rejoice! Children of Greece, rejoice! No change nor trouble shall come again To the island-bard of the deep blue main; Nor blight nor blast To overcast The brightness of his name; Rejoice! Rejoice! All ye that have loved the man, rejoice, Throughout the world! He cannot, now, From the precipice brow Of Glory's hill be hurl'd? And you, ye men of Greece, For his heart is yours While time endures— A flame That will burn eternally— And sound that will never cease! And ye that have loved him, where There 's freedom in the air, O peace! For his beautiful eyes, Under Grecian skies, Were shut by the hands of Grecian men And the voice of his heart Will never depart Away from the land of the brave again: O peace! For he lifted his head, With a sorrowful look, When the spirit fled, And the temple shook, Forgetful of all that were nearest; And he thought of his home O'er the ocean foam; And call'd upon them that were dearest; The mother and the blue-eyed child, The last words of Byron related to his wife and child. Far, far away, And all that in his morning smiled When he was innocent as they— O peace! For his loving voice will haunt the place Of their green repose, Where'er they may lie interr'd, Like his own sweet, unseen bird, That pale and blighted rose: In the Giaour. But where the warriors of the household lie, And they that dwelt in minstrelsy, His voice will sound with a warlike tone, Like the distant cry Of trumpets when the wind is high: O peace! Peace to the ancient halls! Peace to the darken'd walls! And peace to the troubled family, For never again shall one of them be A moment on earth alone, A spirit, wherever they go, Shall go for ever before them; A shelter from every foe, A guardian hovering o'er them; O peace! For every trace Of his glorious face Shall be preserved in the sculptured stone! Embalm'd by Greece, And multiplied On every side, Instinct with immortality— His rest for aye in the warrior-grave— His heart in the tomb of the Grecian brave; His marble head Enthroned on high, to be Like the best of her ancient dead, A sculptured thought of liberty— A boding forth of Poesy To wake the youthful ages hence,— The gifted of Omnipotence. ODE TO PEACE. Up with thy banners! Out with all thy strength Rock-hearted country of the brave and wise! Huge fortress of the North! unfurl at length All thy sharp streamers o'er the flashing skies Thou that of old, if but a shadow fell— The shadow only of a coming foe, Athwart thy bulwarks—heard the stormy swell Of countless armies gathering below Thy deep foundations; all thy ancient woods Upwaking with a heavy solemn roar, Thy rocks, thy rivers and thy solitudes, And the great sea that broke upon thy shore, Out-thundering to the nations! with the noise Of strange artillery in the earth and sky, Chariots and horsemen, such as God employs, When he would startle to new energy The o'ertired Universe. Up with thee now! Child of the North—New England—Up and heave Thy sumptuous drapery to the wind! Thy brow Begirt with adamant, lay bare; and leave The lurid panoply of death; and go Forth like the mightiest and the best of them Who, if they move to grapple with a foe, Put on a snowy robe—a diadem Of triple stars. Up with thee, in thy grave And awful beauty! Let the nations hear The language of endurance from the brave; The song of peace from such as know not fear. Shall War prevail for ever? Must we be For ever and for ever bound to wage, Like the devouring creatures of the sea, Unceasing battle for our heritage? Are we to sleep in armor? To lie down With lighted thunderbolts, year after year, Lest they who saw their monarch vail his crown At our approach of old, may venture near? What though a fourth of thy brave empire now Is put upon the casting of a die? The land our fathers bled for—that which Thou Regardest as a portion of the sky— And justly too. What though thy outstretch'd hands Are vast and powerful? Thy rocky earth, Rough though it be, more precious than the lands That burn with gold and gems? Of greater worth To thy stout people, Country of the free! Than if thy waters rang o'er beds of pearls, Flashing and sounding with the great high sea,— Or when their wrath was up—in drifts and whirls Threw diamonds—rubies—lumps of light ashore; The wealth of India, or the glorious coil Of shipwreck'd empires freighted with the store Of gone-by ages—founder'd with their spoil. From the four quarters of our strength, are we To keep for ever thundering, night and day? Will nothing do but warfare? Must we be Arm'd to the teeth for ever? arm'd to slay? Are the proud creatures of our soil—our youth, Our fruitage and our hope—are they to go Not reasoning as they ought with words of truth, Along the way of life, but arm'd as though The brave and beauteous earth whereon they tread, Were fashion'd by the Builder of the Skies, Not for his living Image, but the dead— A place for slaughter and for sacrifice; The Golgotha of nations. Must they be Bred up to butchery from their earliest breath? Made to believe that they are serving thee, Our Father! when they sweep a storm of death, O'er portions of thy goodliest heritage, Tearing a path to empire—laying bare The Vineyards of the world, age after age, Or clamoring with ten thousand trumpets where The shadowy monsters of the Great Deep dwell, With star-drift—fire—and shapes magnificent, Creatures that watch thy roaring citadel— The broad black sea—the sun-dropp'd firmament. Father of men! Jehovah! What are they, The rulers of the earth, that they should dare, To set aside thy law—to bid man slay Where thou, their God, hast told him to forbear? New England rouse thee from thy heavy sleep! Storehouse of nations—Lighted of the sky— Great northern hive—Long cherish'd of the deep— Mother of States! To thee we turn our eye! Up with thy heart in prayer, and cry aloud Peace to the Nations; to our Borders peace! Why roll your banners like a thunder-cloud, O'er sky and earth for ever? Let war cease! Let our brave Country lift her arms and swear By Him that dwelleth in eternity, That henceforth and for ever she will wear About her warrior brow, the flowering olive-tree! JOSEPH HAZARD THE FASHIONABLE RAKE. Now far advanced had pass'd the second day, And fainter shone the sun's declining ray, When Austin's walk approach'd a gloomy pile. Large was the structure and of antique style— Two oaks before the white impalement grew, Which far around a circling umbrage threw Poultry at nightly lodging here would stay, And work was done beneath their boughs by day. Beneath one's shade a draw-knife's horse was stood, And many a tool was made of useful wood; Here many a youngster whistled in his cheer, For oft was rake, hoe, scythe, new-handled here— Its fellow oak unto the sight display'd Full many a piece of season'd wood uplaid, For cart, helve, sled, reserved in squared style, And future use, arose the goodly pile. An oval pond spread near the white impale, Its muddled surface to the curling gale; 'T was here the gander march'd in noisy pride, And led his mate and young ones to the tide, The clamorous geese oft sail'd the troubled pool, And tribes of goslings here repair'd to cool— Here duck and drake with all their numerous throng, Quack'd in right gleeful cheer, and swam along. To the large edifice young Lovegrace drew, Which he some wealthy farmer's mansion knew. An arch'd large porch projecting rose before, Secured by outer and with inner door, Above two rows of light in order show, Which round the entrance feeble day-light throw; On either side led up the front of stone, Two wild grape vines long since transplanted grown. The town Arcadia situate near the waves, Whose yellow sands a stream of commerce laves, Presented to the pleased spectator's view, United, rural scene and city too. On a large square its architecture stood, While down each side roll'd a broad silver flood; Ships of all sizes here safe in harbor lay, And parti-color'd pendants deck the bay. The streets were broad and even length'ning drawn, And in its centre smiled a spacious lawn. Chinese precinct'ring work enclosed its ground, And trees of pride of India bloom'd around, Two outward rows at equal distance grew, Form'd shade and walk of use and beauty too. Their flowers a native extra worth assume, And pride themselves in long continued bloom; These too again in inner walks are seen With balm of Gilead interplaced between. Through the whole lawn now pride of India shows, And here an aromatic balm of Gilead grows. The fence was lined throughout its ample square, And different shrubbery different colors wear. Here stands the laurel crown'd in generous bloom, Here breathes the honeysuckle's sweet perfume. The pale white rose attracts the passing eye, And here the damask scented richer dye, The inner walks with tints continued glow, As some decline new opening beauties flow. Around the lawn are seen, Four summer houses which adorn the green, Whose opening diamond work invites the air, And vine of grapes and jessamines livery wear, Luxuriant branches o'er their archings run, And loveliest verdure shades the unwelcome sun. NATHANIEL H. CARTER HYMN FOR CHRISTMAS. In hymns of praise, eternal God! When thy creating hand Stretch'd the blue arch of heaven abroad, And meted sea and land, The morning stars together sung, And shouts of joy from angels rung. Than Earth's prime hour, more joyous far Was the eventful morn, When the bright beam of Bethlehem's star Announced a Saviour born! Then sweeter strains from heaven began— “Glory to God—good will to man.” Babe of the manger! can it be? Art thou the Son of God? Shall subject nations bow the knee, And kings obey thy nod? Shall thrones and monarchs prostrate fall Before the tenant of a stall? 'T is He! the hymning seraphs cry, While hovering, drawn to earth; 'T is he! the shepherds' songs reply, Hail! hail Emmanuel's birth! The rod of peace those hands shall bear, That brow a crown of glory wear! 'T is He! the eastern sages sing, And spread their golden hoard; 'T is He! the hills of Sion ring, Hosanna to the Lord! The Prince of long prophetic years To day in Bethlehem appears! He comes! the Conqueror's march begins, No blood his banner stains; He comes to save the world from sins, And break the captive's chains! The poor, the sick and blind shall bless The Prince of Peace and Righteousness. Though now in swaddling-clothes he lies, All hearts his power shall own, When he, with legions of the skies, The clouds of heaven his throne, Shall come to judge the quick and dead, And strike a trembling world with dread. PAINS OF THE IMAGINATION. On ocean's cliff, see beauty wild and pale, Watching alone the fury of the gale: Amid the dangers of the rugged coast, She marks her sailor's gallant vessel tost; Frantic with grief, her sunny locks she tears, As the red lightning on the breakers glares, And o'er the tumult of the boiling deep, Mad whirlwinds howl, and dark tornadoes sweep. Shall she, delighted, hear the tempest rave, And list the murmurs of the dashing wave! Think ye the grandeur of the scene can charm Her heart, that throbs at every gust alarm! Behold yon volumes of sulphureous smoke, Roll in black wreaths, and heaven with vapor choke The mountain trembles, and the earth afar Feels the dread shock of elemental war; Loud roars the ocean, and the mingled din Breaks on the ear from rumbling caves within: Then flames the crater: to the skies aspire The liquid gushes of volcanic fire. Aghast the peasant of Campania stands, And mourns his ruin'd cot, his deluged lands, Perchance his wife, his children's hapless doom, Buried in flame, and hurried to the tomb. While his lorn bosom is with anguish wrung, Cares he what bards the scene sublime have sung? How many Plinies once admired the sight, Its grandeur traced, then perish'd in delight? But hark!—in southern climes along the ground, Like distant thunders, runs a hollow sound: Wide and more wide extends the sullen jar, As when conflicting chariots rush to war; Rocks, woods, and plains the wild commotion feel, And the tall Andes to their bases reel; In mountain waves, the undulating lea Heaves, like the tossings of a troubled sea; Impending ruin mocks the force of art, And ghastly terror seizes every heart. Then yawns the fathomless abyss, and down At once are hurl'd the works of old renown, The monuments of ages; all that man, His genius, taste, and luxury could plan: All, all in one promiscuous grave repose, O'er which the earth, and gushing waters close, And hence along the stagnant lake and plain, Shall solitude and desolation reign. Oh! who hath not in fancy trod alone, The trackless deserts of the burning zone, Nor felt a dreariness oppress his soul, To mark the sands in eddies round him roll, Like ocean's billows, threatening to o'erwhelm, His wilder'd march, through many a weary realm? No verdure smiles, no crystal fountains play, To quench the arrows of the god of day, No breezy lawns, no cool, meandering streams, Allay the fervor of his torrid beams; No whispering zephyrs fan the glowing skies; But o'er long tracts the mournful siroc sighs, Whose desolating march, whose withering breath Sweeps through the caravan with instant death; The wandering Arab, startled at the sound, Mantles his face, and presses close the ground, Till o'er his prostrate, weary limbs hath pass'd, In sullen gusts, the poison-wafting blast. 'T is night: but there the sparkling heavens diffuse No genial showers, no soft-distilling dews; In the hot sky, the stars, of lustre shorn, Burn o'er the pathway of the wanderer lorn, And the red moon, from Babelmandel's strand, Looks, as she climbs, through pyramids of sand, That whirl'd aloft, and gilded by her light, Blaze the lone beacons of the desert night. From distant wilds is heard the dismal howl Of hideous monsters, that in darkness prowl: Urged by gaunt famine from his lair and home. Along the waste, the tiger's footsteps roam, And from afar, the fierce hyena's scream At midnight breaks the traveller's fitful dream. MOSES Y. SCOTT POCAHONTAS. Rude was the storm, and her fallen hair Stream'd in the gale from her bosom bare; As alone, through the forest's blacken'd shade, On errand of fear came the Indian maid. Wild was her look; but her eye was bright With the melting beam of Mercy's light— Her speech was hurried; but kindness hung On the accents bland of her warning tongue. “White men, beware of Havoc's sweep! He is waked in the forest, from sullen sleep— He would drink your blood, in a guardless hour, And your wives and slumbering babes devour. “Beware!—for, the tempest, chain'd so long, Shall burst tonight, in its fury strong— The trees must root them against its sway, And their branches cling, or be scatter'd away! “The fire shall rage; for, the breeze is blowing— The smoke rolls hither—the flames are glowing; They climb the hills; to the vales they spread— The night is black; but the forest is red. “White men, beware!—And when at last, Your fears are dead, and your dangers past, Shall the voice of the warner be e'er betray'd— Shall white men forget the Indian maid?” HENRY WARE, JR. THE VISION OF LIBERTY. The evening heavens were calm and bright; No dimness rested on the glittering light, That sparkled from that wilderness of worlds on high Those distant suns burn'd on with quiet ray; The placid planets held their modest way; And silence reign'd profound o'er earth, and sea, and sky. Oh what an hour for lofty thought! My spirit burn'd within; I caught A holy inspiration from the hour. Around me man and nature slept; Alone my solemn watch I kept, Till morning dawn'd, and sleep resumed her power. A vision pass'd upon my soul. I still was gazing up to heaven, As in the early hours of even; I still beheld the planets roll, And all those countless sons of light Flame from the broad blue arch, and guide the moonless night. When, lo, upon the plain, Just where it skirts the swelling main, A massive castle, far and high, In towering grandeur broke upon my eye. Proud in its strength and years, the pond'rous pile Flung up its time-defying towers; Its lofty gates seem'd scornfully to smile At vain assault of human powers, And threats and arms deride. Its gorgeous carvings of heraldic pride In giant masses graced the walls above, And dungeons yawn'd below. Yet ivy there and moss their garlands wove, Grave, silent chroniclers of time's protracted flow. Bursting on my steadfast gaze, See, within, a sudden blaze! So small at first, the zephyr's slightest swell, That scarcely stirs the pine tree top, Nor makes the wither'd leaf to drop, The feeble fluttering of that flame would quell. But soon it spread— Waving, rushing, fierce, and red, From wall to wall, from tower to tower, Raging with resistless power; Till every fervent pillar glow'd, And every stone seem'd burning coal, Instinct with living heat, that flow'd Like streaming radiance from the kindled pole. Beautiful, fearful, grand, Silent as death, I saw the fabric stand. At length a crackling sound began; From side to side, throughout the pile it ran; And louder yet, and louder grew, Till now in rattling thunder-peals it grew, Huge shiver'd fragments from the pillars broke, Like fiery sparkles from the anvil's stroke. The shatter'd walls were rent and riven, And piecemeal driven Like blazing comets through the troubled sky. 'T is done; what centuries had rear'd, In quick explosion disappear'd, Nor even its ruins met my wondering eye. But in their place,— Bright with more than human grace, Robed in more than mortal seeming, Radiant glory in her face, And eyes with heaven's own brightness beaming, Rose a fair majestic form, As the mild rainbow from the storm. I mark'd her smile, I knew her eye; And when, with gesture of command, She waved aloft the cap-crown'd wand, My slumbers fled mid shouts of “Liberty!” Read ye the dream? and know ye not How truly it unlock'd the word of fate? Went not the flame from this illustrious spot, And spreads it not, and burns in every state? And when their old and cumbrous walls, Fill'd with this spirit, glow intense, Vainly they rear their impotent defence— The fabric falls! That fervent energy must spread, Till despotism's towers be overthrown; And in their stead, Liberty stands alone! Hasten the day, just Heaven! Accomplish thy design; And let the blessings thou hast freely given, Freely on all men shine; Till equal rights be equally enjoy'd, And human power for human good employ'd; Till law, not man, the sovereign rule sustain, And peace and virtue undisputed reign. SEASONS OF PRAYER. To prayer, to prayer;—for the morning breaks, And earth in her Maker's smile awakes. His light is on all below and above, The light of gladness and life and love. Oh, then, on the breath of this early air, Send upward the incense of grateful prayer. To prayer;—for the glorious sun is gone, And the gathering darkness of night comes on. Like a curtain from God's kind hand it flows To shade the couch where his children repose. Then kneel, while the watching stars are bright, And give your last thoughts to the Guardian of night. To prayer;—for the day that God has blest Comes tranquilly on with its welcome rest. It speaks of creation's early bloom; It speaks of the Prince who burst the tomb. Then summon the spirit's exalted powers, And devote to heaven the hallow'd hours. There are smiles and tears in the mother's eyes, For her new-born infant beside her lies. Oh hour of bliss! when the heart o'erflows With rapture a mother only knows. Let it gush forth in words of fervent prayer; Let it swell up to heaven for her precious care. There are smiles and tears in that gathering band, Where the heart is pledged with the trembling hand. What trying thoughts in her bosom swell, As the bride bids parents and home farewell! Kneel down by the side of the tearful fair, And strengthen the perilous hour with prayer. Kneel down by the dying sinner's side, And pray for his soul through him who died. Large drops of anguish are thick on his brow; Oh what is earth and its pleasures now? And what shall assuage his dark despair, But the penitent cry of humble prayer? Kneel down at the couch of departing faith, And hear the last words the believer saith. He has bidden adieu to his earthly friends; There is peace in his eye that upwards bends; There is peace in his calm confiding air; For his last thoughts are God's, his last words prayer. The voice of prayer at the sable bier! A voice to sustain, to soothe, and to cheer. It commends the spirit to God who gave; It lifts the thoughts from the cold dark grave; It points to the glory where he shall reign, Who whisper'd, “Thy brother shall rise again.” The voice of prayer in the world of bliss! But gladder, purer, than rose from this. The ransom'd shout to their glorious King, Where no sorrow shades the soul as they sing; But a sinless and joyous song they raise; And their voice of prayer is eternal praise. Awake, awake, and gird up thy strength To join that holy band at length. To Him, who unceasing love displays, Whom the powers of nature unceasingly praise, To Him thy heart and thy hours be given; For a life of prayer is the life of heaven. JOHN E. HALL REFLECTIONS OF A RECLUSE. Days of my youth, ah, whither have ye fled! Moments of innocence, of health and joy, Unruffled by the thoughts of worldly care, With throbs of sad delight, how oft I sigh, When Recollection paints thy scenes anew, My steps ye led to halls where minstrels struck The breathing lyre, to sing of Beauty's charms, Or chivalry's heroic deeds. Not then, I pour'd The melancholy song of memory; No solitary tale my idle hours could tell Of sorrow; Hope departed; or Despair. My dulcet harp was strung to Rapture's notes; Its jocund strings re-echoed themes of love, Or careless caroll'd what young joys could teach. When twilight came, I sought the mountain's brow, To mark her solemn grandeur hastening near. Then, ah! then, I woo'd the charms of silence, Far from the pageant show of restless man, The pomp of pride, the sneer of haughtiness: Malice, with quivering lip, and knawing care: Envy, that blasts the buds whose perfumed dyes She fain would equal: green-eyed Jealousy: And spectres of despair, whom memory brings To haunt the slumbering dreams of guilty men, Of these, yet ignorant and their powers unfelt, I rioted in youth's gay harvest, And quaff'd the cup of roseate health and joy. But I am changed now! If e'er I smile, 't is as the flower of spring, Whose tincture blooms through drops of morning dew! And when the once loved charms of solitude I woo, amid the valley's silence, Or on the high hill top, where thunders loud Proclaim to man the majesty of God, 'T is not to bathe in dreams of shadowy bliss, Or fondly dwell on scenes of wild romance: To weave a sonnet for my mistress' brow, Or con an artless song to soothe her ear! No cheerful thoughts like these entice my feet Through tangled dells or o'er the mountain's height. Hopeless and sad in gloomy nooks retired, I love to watch the slow revolving moon, And muse on visions fled of treacherous love, Of joys departed, and deceitful hopes: Me now, no more the balmy breeze of spring, Nor summer's streamlets murm'ring through the grove, Nor changeful winds that yellow autumn brings, Can yield delight—stern winter's joyless gloom Suits with my bosom's cold and cheerless state! Life's purple tide no more salubrious flows; The vernal glow of hope is fled: and joy, Shall glad no more my once contented cot: False, fickle woman drove her smiles away. All hail, December's chilling skies! Come darken more the anguish of my soul. Bring with thy gloomy hours despair's sad shades— Bring all the load that misery prepares, To gall us through the miry road of life: Bring silent sorrow with her bitter brow: Bring lovely woman, with her syren smile, Like transient meteor to seduce our steps: Bring care, with self-consuming wants oppress'd, And doubt, to lead us from our onward path, And sharp solicitudes to vex our nights: Let war, too, throw her lurid glare around, And turn the savage from his hunter toils, To raise the tomahawk and bend the bow. In her funereal train attendant, Let famine stalk, and, with insatiate hand, Fell plunder, knowing neither friend nor foe, And violence, to stain the soldier's name. Let bloody slaughter loose, to dye with gore Our soil, and teach the world what evils wait On madden'd counsels and ambitious schemes. Accursed schemes! that saw no wrath denounced On souls remorseless shedding human blood. Detested plans! which bade the cymbals strike, Roused the loud clarion, and made the cannon roar, To drown the Saviour's voice proclaiming loud, To God on high be glory given: on earth, Let peace among mankind for ever reign. CARLOS WILCOX THE RELIGION OF TASTE. 'T was one of summer's last and loveliest days, When at the dawn, with a congenial friend I rose to climb the mount, that with the gaze Of expectation high we long had kenn'd, While travelling toward it as our journey's end:— Height after height we reach'd that seem'd the last; But far above, where we must yet ascend, Another and another rose, till fast The sun began to sink ere all but one were past. Upon that loftiest one awhile we stood Silent with wonder and absorbing awe; A thousand peaks, the lowest crown'd with wood, The highest of bare rock at once we saw, In ranges spread till seeming to withdraw Far into heaven, and mix their softer blue; While ranges near, as if in spite of law, With all wild shapes and grand fill'd up the view And o'er the deep dark gulf fantastic shadows threw. Here billows heaved in one vast swell, and there In one long sweep, as on a stormy sea, Drawn to a curling edge, seem'd held in air, Ready to move as from a charm set free, And roar, and dash, and sink, and cease to be; While firm and smooth as hewn of emerald rock, Below them rose to points of one proud tree, Green pyramids of pine, that seem'd to mock In conscious safety proud, their vainly threaten'd shock. Here while the sun yet shone, abysses vast Like openings into inner regions seem'd All objects fading, mingling, sinking fast, Save few that shut up where the sun yet beam'd; But soon as his last rays around us stream'd Thick darkness wrapt the whole, o'er which the glow Of western skies in feeble flashes gleam'd, While bright from pole to pole extending slow Along the wide horizon ere it sunk below. 'T was midnight, when from our sequester'd bower I stole with sleepless eyes to gaze alone; For 't is alone we feel in its full power, The enchantment o'er a scene so awful thrown:— Through broken flying clouds the moon now shone, And light and shade cross'd mountain-top and vale; While with imparted motion, not their own, The heavens and earth to fancy seem'd to sail Through boundless space like her creation bright but frail. Ere long the clouds were gone, the moon was set; When deeply blue without a shade of gray, The sky was fill'd with stars that almost met, Their points prolong'd and sharpen'd to one ray; Through their transparent air the milky-way Seem'd one broad flame of pure resplendent white, As if some globe on fire, turn'd far astray, Had cross'd the wide arch with so swift a flight, That for a moment shone its whole long track of light. At length in northern skies, at first but small, A sheet of light meteorous begun To spread on either hand, and rise and fall In waves, that slowly first, then quickly run Along its edge, set thick but one by one With spiry beams, that all at once shot high, Like those through vapors from the setting sun; Then sidelong as before the wind they fly, Like streaking rain from clouds that flit along the sky. Now all the mountain-tops and gulfs between Seem'd one dark plain; from forests, caves profound, And rushing waters far below unseen, Rose a deep roar in one united sound, Alike pervading all the air around, And seeming e'en the azure dome to fill, And from it through soft ether to resound In low vibrations, sending a sweet thrill To every finger's end from rapture deep and still. Spent with emotion, and to rest resign'd, A sudden sleep fell on me, and subdued With visions bright and dread my restless mind;— Methought that in a realm of solitude, All indistinctly like the one just view'd, With guilt oppress'd and with foreboding gloom, My lonely way bewilder'd I pursued, Mid signs of terror that the day of doom, And lovely nature's last dissolving hour had come. The sun and moon in depths of ether sunk Till half extinct, shed their opposing light In dismal union, at which all things shrunk;— Anon they both, like meteors streaming bright, Ran down the sky and vanished—all was night; With that a groan as from earth's centre rose, While o'er its surface ran, o'er vale and height, A waving as of woods when wild wind blows, A heaving as of life in its expiring throes. Far in the broad horizon dimly shone A flood of fire, advancing with a roar, Like that of ocean when the waves are thrown In nightly storms high on a rocky shore;— Spreading each way it came, and sweeping o'er Woodlands like stubble, forests wide and tall In thick ranks falling, blooming groves before Its fury vanishing too soon to fall, And mountains melting down—one deluge covering all. Before it, striking quick from cloud to cloud, Stream'd its unearthly light along the sky, Flashing from all the swift wings of a crowd Of frighted birds at random soaring high, And from the faces of lost men that fly In throngs beneath, as back they snatch'd a look Of horror at the billows rolling nigh, With thundering sound at which all nature shook, And e'en the strength of hope their sinking hearts forsook. No more I saw, for while I thought to flee, What seem'd the swoon of terror held me fast, My senses drowned, and set my fancy free, Waked not, but back to sleep unconscious cast My troubled spirit; one dark moment pass'd, And, all revived again, my dream went on; But in that interval what changes vast! The earth and its lost multitudes were gone; A new creation bless'd eternity's bright dawn. Myself I found borne to a heavenly clime I knew not how, but felt a stranger there; Still the same being that I was in time, E'en to my raiment; on the borders fair Of that blest land I stood in lone despair; Not its pure beauty and immortal bloom, Its firmament serene and balmy air, Nor all its glorious beings, broke the gloom Of my foreboding thoughts, fix'd on some dreadful doom. There walk'd the ransom'd ones of earth in white, As beautifully pure as new-fallen snow, On the smooth summit of some eastern height, In the first rays of morn that o'er it flow, Nor less resplendent than the richest glow Of snow-white clouds, with all their stores of rain And thunder spent, roll'd up in volumes slow O'er the blue sky just clear'd from every stain, Till all the blaze of noon they drink and long retain. Safe landed on these shores, together hence That bright throng took their way to where insphered In a transparent cloud of light intense, With starry pinnacles above it reared, A city vast, the inland all appear'd, With walls of azure, green and purple stone, All to one glassy surface smooth'd and clear'd, Reflecting forms of angel guards that shone Above the approaching host as each were on a throne. And while that host moved onward o'er a plain Of living verdure, oft they turn'd to greet Friends that on earth had taught them heaven to gain; Then hand in hand they went with quicken'd feet; And bright with immortality, and sweet With love ethereal, were the smiles they cast; I only wander'd on with none to meet And call me dear, while pointing to the past, And forward to the joys that never reach their last. I had not bound myself by any ties To that bless'd land; none saw me and none sought; Nor any shunn'd, or from me turn'd their eyes; And yet such sense of guilt and conscience wrought, It seem'd that every bosom's inmost thought Was fix'd on me; when back as from their view I shrunk, and would have fled or shrunk to nought, As some I loved and many that I knew Pass'd on unmindful why or whither I withdrew Whereat of sad remembrances a flood Rush'd o'er my spirit, and my heart beat low As with the heavy gush of curdling blood:— Soon left behind, awhile I follow'd slow, Then stopp'd and round me look'd, my fate to know, But look'd in vain;—no voice my doom to tell;— No arm to hurl me down the depths of wo;— It seem'd that I was brought to heaven to dwell That conscience might alone do all the work of hell. Now came the thought, the bitter thought of years Wasted in musings sad and fancies wild, And in the visionary hopes and fears Of the false feeling of a heart beguiled By nature's strange enchantment, strong and wild; Now with celestial beauty blooming round, I stood as on some naked waste exiled; From gathering hosts came music's swelling sound, But deeper in despair my sinking spirits drown'd. At length methought a darkness as of death Came slowly o'er me, and with that I woke; Yet knew not in the first suspended breath Where I could be, so real seem'd the stroke, That in my dream all earthly ties had broke; A moment more, and melting in a tide Of grateful fervor, how did I invoke Power from the Highest to leave all beside, And live but to secure the bliss my dream denied. The day soon dawn'd, and I could not but view Its purple tinge in heaven, and then its beams Revealing all around me, as they flew From peak to peak, and striking in soft gleams On the white mists that hung o'er winding streams Through trackless forests, and o'er clustering lakes In valleys wide, where many a green height seems An isle above the cloud that round it breaks, As with the breeze it moves and its deep bed forsakes. SAMUEL B. BEACH ESCALALA. The war-whoop's boding sound Rose fearfully and shrill: By echo's thousand voices, round, Wide wafted over dale and hill, It volley'd through the distant plain, That peal'd its thunders back again. The wolf aroused him from his den, Far northward, in the wildest glen On Simcoe's dreary shore; And, high o'er Alleghany's peak, The vulture heard, and trimm'd his beak To feast on human gore. The runners, by their Chief's command, The war-club, tinged with fearful red, Rear'd high in air, a signal dread, And waved it through the land. It glanced amid the pathless wood That shadow'd Susquehannah's flood; And down Ontario's wilds, afar, Told proudly of the coming war: On dark Missouri's turbid stream The countless tribes beheld it gleam, And blithely, for the field array'd, Obedience to its summons paid. By its own gallant chieftains led on to the fight, Each tribe musters proudly its numbers and might, And—like mountain streams rushing to mingle their foam In the dell's troubled bosom—all darkly they come; The line is forming, broad and bright, Like meteors on the brow of night, As to the wind their light folds stream, Standards and banners o'er it gleam; And plumes and shields and helmets, glancing From mail-clad chiefs in hurried motion, Rise, sink and glow, like bubbles dancing Upon the storm-vex'd face of ocean. In front, and facing to the fosse, O'er which the coming foe must cross— Their left arms bare, and round the waist Their quivers, stored with arrows, braced, Ready of eye and firm of hand, The light and active archers stand; Each with his bow of ample length, Well proved for vigor and for strength, And cloth-yard shafts—that to the heart May pierce, when from the string they part. Supporting these—with rearward sweep, In darkening columns, broad and deep— Fast to their posts wheel silently The close-rank'd veteran infantry, The sinews of the host—who bear The tug and burden of the war, When man to man his might opposes In long and fierce and doubtful strife, And one or both must part with life Before the awful contest closes. Upon the wings form, prompt and free, The light and heavy cavalry; And the snort and the neigh of each bounding steed, As his rider is curbing his headlong speed, And the foam on the bit which he angrily champs, And the short, hollow moan of the ground, as he stamps And spurns it impatiently—tell to the eye And the ear, he is conscious the battle is nigh; And pants for the moment when, loose from the rein, He shall rush on the flying and trample the slain. Far down Ohio's vale, the pilgrim sees The rank grass floating, in the grateful breeze, Above the hallow'd mould, where sleep the brave Of ages past, in the neglected grave; And of the peasant, as his labors turn The whitening bones above their earthly urn, Pauses a moment, o'er his reckless share, To wonder whose sad relics moulder there: Yet, nor the peasant nor the pilgrim knows The record of their fame, the story of their woes. But viewless spirits linger round the scene Where valor, worth and glory erst have been; Bidding each gale, as far its sweets are shed, Sigh nature's requiem o'er the mighty dead: While their high harps, responsive, wake again The echoes of the sadly-pleasing strain, To prompt from pity's eye the willing tear And tell their wondrous tale in Fancy's ear. Soothed by the sound, the native minstrel caught A portion of the lay their numbers taught, And from his rustic lyre, by Freedom strung Its plaintive wild-notes fearlessly he flung. Rude is the theme he chose, and small the praise He claims, to recompense his artless lays: Content, if Genius, from her boundless mines, Hath lent one gem, to deck the wreath he twines; Or taste shall find one native flowret there, Which claims her plaudits and his country's care. To thee, my country! and to thine, belong The fame, the labors of thy “sons of song:” Be thine, henceforth, the pleasing task, to give The boon which bids that fame, those labors live; Nor deem, of course, the chaplet little worth, Whose wreaths are twined from flowers of native growth. Proud of their freedom, let thy children be In taste and science, as in spirit, free; So shall thy daring minstrels soon aspire With bolder sweep to wake the slumbering lyre; Till, o'er the broad Atlantic echoing round, Admiring Europe hail the heavenly sound, And, roused to rapture by its magic charms, Confess thy bards as matchless as thy arms. WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT THE AGES. When, to the common rest that crowns our days, Call'd in the noon of life, the good man goes, Or full of years, and ripe in wisdom, lays His silver temples in their last repose; When, o'er the buds of youth, the death-wind blows, And blights the fairest; when our bitterest tears Stream, as the eyes of those that love us close, We think on what they were, with many fears Lest Goodness die with them, and leave the coming years. And therefore, to our hearts, the days gone by,— When lived the honor'd sage whose death we wept, And the soft virtues beam'd from many an eye, And beat in many a heart that long has slept,— Like spots of earth where angel-feet have stept— Are holy; and high-dreaming bards have told Of times when worth was crown'd, and faith was kept, Ere friendship grew a snare, or love wax'd cold— Those pure and happy times—the golden days of old. Peace to the just man's memory,—let it grow Greener with years, and blossom through the flight Of ages; let the mimic canvas show His calm benevolent features; let the light Stream on his deeds of love, that shunn'd the sight Of all but heaven, and, in the book of fame, The glorious record of his virtues write, And hold it up to men, and bid them claim A palm like his, and catch from him the hallow'd flame. But oh, despair not of their fate who rise To dwell upon the earth when we withdraw; Lo! the same shaft, by which the righteous dies, Strikes through the wretch that scoff'd at mercy's law, And trode his brethren down, and felt no awe Of him who will avenge them. Stainless worth, Such as the sternest age of virtue saw, Ripens, meanwhile, till time shall call it forth From the low modest shade, to light and bless the earth. Has Nature, in her calm majestic march, Falter'd with age at last? does the bright sun Grow dim in heaven? or, in their far blue arch, Sparkle the crowd of stars, when day is done, Less brightly? when the dew-lipp'd spring comes on, Breathes she with airs less soft, or scents the sky With flowers less fair than when her reign begun? Does prodigal autumn, to our age, deny The plenty that once swell'd beneath his sober eye? Look on this beautiful world, and read the truth In her fair page; see, every season brings New change, to her, of everlasting youth; Still the green soil, with joyous living things, Swarms, the wide air is full of joyous wings, And myriads, still, are happy in the sleep Of ocean's azure gulfs, and where he flings The restless surge. Eternal love doth keep In his complacent arms, the earth, the air, the deep. Will then the merciful One, who stamp'd our race With his own image, and who gave them sway O'er earth, and the glad dwellers on her face, Now that our flourishing nations far away Are spread, where'er the moist earth drinks the day, Forget the ancient care that taught and nursed His latest offspring? will he quench the ray Infused by his own forming smile at first, And leave a work so fair all blighted and accursed? Oh no! a thousand cheerful omens give Hope of yet happier days whose dawn is nigh He, who has tamed the elements, shall not live The slave of his own passions; he whose eye Unwinds the eternal dances of the sky, And in the abyss of brightness dares to span The sun's broad circle, rising yet more high, In God's magnificent works his will shall scan— And love and peace shall make their paradise with man. Sit at the feet of history—through the night Of years the steps of virtue she shall trace, And show the earlier ages, where her sight Can pierce the eternal shadows o'er their face;— When, from the genial cradle of our race, Went forth the tribes of men, their pleasant lot To choose, where palm-groves cool'd their dwelling place, Or freshening rivers ran; and there forgot The truth of heaven, and kneel'd to gods that heard them not. Then waited not the murderer for the night, But smote his brother down in the bright day, And he who felt the wrong, and had the might, His own avenger, girt himself to slay; Beside the path the unburied carcass lay; The shepherd, by the fountains of the glen, Fled, while the robber swept his flock away, And slew his babes. The sick, untended then, Languish'd in the damp shade, and died afar from men. But misery brought in love—in passion's strife Man gave his heart to mercy pleading long, And sought out gentle deeds to gladden life; The weak, against the sons of spoil and wrong, Banded, and watch'd their hamlets, and grew strong. States rose, and, in the shadow of their might, The timid rested. To the reverent throng, Grave and time-wrinkled men, with locks all white, Gave laws, and judged their strifes, and taught the way of right. Till bolder spirits seized the rule, and nail'd On men the yoke that man should never bear, And drove them forth to battle: Lo! unveil'd The scene of those stern ages! What is there? A boundless sea of blood, and the wild air Moans with the crimson surges that in tomb Cities and banner'd armies; forms that wear The kingly circlet, rise, amid the gloom, O'er the dark wave, and straight are swallow'd in its womb. Those ages have no memory—but they left A record in the desert—columns strown On the waste sands, and statues fall'n and cleft, Heap'd like a host in battle overthrown; Vast ruins, where the mountain's ribs of stone Were hewn into a city; streets that spread In the dark earth, where never breath has blown Of heaven's sweet air, nor foot of man dares tread The long and perilous ways—the cities of the dead; And tombs of monarchs to the clouds up-piled— They perish'd—but the eternal tombs remain— And the black precipice, abrupt and wild, Pierced by long toil and hollow'd to a fane;— Huge piers and frowning forms of gods sustain The everlasting arches, dark and wide, Like the night heaven when clouds are black with rain. But idly skill was task'd, and strength was plied, All was the work of slaves, to swell a despot's pride. And virtue cannot dwell with slaves, nor reign O'er those who cower to take a tyrant's yoke; She left the down-trod nations in disdain, And flew to Greece, when liberty awoke, New-born, amid those beautiful vales, and broke Sceptre and chain with her fair youthful hands, As the rock shivers in the thunder stroke. And lo! in full-grown strength, an empire stands Of leagued and rival states, the wonder of the lands. Oh Greece! thy flourishing cities were a spoil Unto each other; thy hard hand oppress'd And crush'd the helpless; thou didst make thy soil Drunk with the blood of those that loved thee best; And thou didst drive, from thy unnatural breast, Thy just and brave to die in distant climes; Earth shudder'd at thy deeds, and sigh'd for rest From thine abominations; after times That yet shall read thy tale, will tremble at thy crimes. Yet there was that within thee which has saved Thy glory, and redeem'd thy blotted name; The story of thy better deeds, engraved On fame's unmouldering pillar, puts to shame Our chiller virtue; the high art to tame The whirlwind of thy passions was thine own; And the pure ray, that from thy bosom came, Far over many a land and age has shone, And mingles with the light that beams from God's own throne. And Rome, thy sterner, younger sister, she Who awed the world with her imperial frown, Drew the deep spirit of her race from thee,— The rival of thy shame and thy renown. Yet her degenerate children sold the crown Of earth's wide kingdoms to a line of slaves; Guilt reign'd, and wo with guilt, and plagues came down, Till the North broke its flood gates, and the waves Whelm'd the degraded race, and welter'd o'er their graves. Vainly that ray of brightness from above, That shone around the Galilean lake, The light of hope, the leading star of love, Struggled, the darkness of that day to break; Even its own faithless guardians strove to slake, In fogs of earth, the pure immortal flame; And priestly hands, for Jesus' blessed sake, Were red with blood, and charity became. In that stern war of forms, a mockery and a name. They triumph'd, and less bloody rites were kept Within the quiet of the convent cell; The well-fed inmates patter'd prayer, and slept, And sinn'd, and liked their easy penance well. Where pleasant was the spot for men to dwell, Amid its fair broad lands the abbey lay, Sheltering dark orgies that were shame to tell And cowl'd and barefoot beggars swarm'd the way, All in their convent weeds, of black, and white, and gray. Oh, sweetly the returning muses' strain Swell'd over that famed stream, whose gentle tide In their bright lap the Etrurian vales detain, Sweet, as when winter storms have ceased to chide, And all the new leaved woods, resounding wide, Send out wild hymns upon the scented air. Lo! to the smiling Arno's classic side The emulous nations of the west repair, And kindle their quench'd urns, and drink fresh spirit there. Still, heaven deferr'd the hour ordain'd to rend From saintly rottenness the sacred stole; And cowl and worshipp'd shrine could still defend The wretch with felon stains upon his soul; And crimes were set to sale, and hard his dole Who could not bribe a passage to the skies; And vice beneath the mitre's kind control, Sinn'd gaily on, and grew to giant size, Shielded by priestly power, and watch'd by priestly eyes. At last the earthquake came—the shock, that hurl'd To earth, in many fragments dash'd and strown, The throne, whose roots were in another world, And whose far stretching shadow awed our own. From many a proud monastic pile, o'erthrown, Fear-struck, the hooded inmates rush'd and fled; The web, that for a thousand years had grown O'er prostrate Europe, in that day of dread Crumbled and fell, as fire dissolves the flaxen thread. The spirit of that day is still awake, And spreads himself, and shall not sleep again; But through the idle mesh of power shall break, Like billows o'er the Asian monarch's chain; Till men are fill'd with him, and feel how vain, Instead of the pure heart and innocent hands, Are all the proud and pompous modes to gain The smile of heaven;—till a new age expands Its white and holy wings above the peaceful lands. For look again on the past years;—behold, Flown, like the night-mare's fearful dreams, away Full many a horrible worship, that, of old, Subdued the shuddering realms to its dark sway; And crimes that fear'd not once the eye of day, Rooted from men, without a name or place; And nations blotted out from earth, to pay The forfeit of deep guilt;—with glad embrace The fair disburden'd lands welcome a nobler race. Thus error's monstrous shapes from earth are driven; They fade, they fly—but truth survives their flight; Earth has no shades to quench that beam of heaven; Each ray, that shone, in early time, to light The faltering footsteps in the path of right, The broader glow of brightness, shed to aid In man's maturer day his bolder sight, All blended, like the rainbow's radiant braid, Pour yet, and still shall pour, the blaze that cannot fade. Late, from this western shore, that morning chased The deep and ancient night, that threw its shroud O'er the green land of groves, the beautiful waste, Nurse of full streams, and lifter up of proud Sky-mingling mountains that o'erlook the cloud. Erewhile, where yon gay spires their brightness rear, Trees waved, and the brown hunter's shouts were loud Amid the forest; and the bounding deer Fled at the glancing plume, and the gaunt wolf yell'd near. And where his willing waves yon bright blue bay Sends up, to kiss his decorated brim, And cradles, in his soft embrace, the gay Young group of grassy islands born of him, And, crowding nigh, or in the distance dim, Lifts the white throng of sails, that bear or bring The commerce of the world;—with tawny limb, And belt and beads in sunlight glistening, The savage urged his skiff like wild bird on the wing. Then, all his youthful paradise around, And all the broad and boundless mainland, lay Cool'd by the interminable wood, that frown'd O'er mound and vale, where never summer ray Glanced, till the strong tornado broke his way Through the grey giants of the sylvan wild; Yet many a shelter'd glade, with blossoms gay, Beneath the showery sky and sunshine mild, Within the shaggy arms of that dark forest smiled. There stood the Indian hamlet, there the lake Spread its blue sheet that flash'd with many an oar, Where the brown otter plunged him from the brake, And the deer drank—as the light gale flew o'er, The twinkling maize-field rustled on the shore; And while that spot, so wild and lone and fair, A look of glad and innocent beauty wore, And peace was on the earth and in the air, The warrior lit the pile, and bound his captive there: Not unavenged—the foeman, from the wood, Beheld the deed, and when the midnight shade Was stillest, gorged his battle-axe with blood; All died—the wailing babe—the shrieking maid— And in the flood of fire that scathed the glade, The roofs went down; but deep the silence grew, When on the dewy woods the day-beam play'd; No more the cabin smokes rose wreath'd and blue, And ever, by their lake, lay moor'd the light canoe. Look now abroad—another race has fill'd These populous borders—wide the wood recedes, And towns shoot up, and fertile realms are till'd; The land is full of harvests and green meads; Streams numberless, that many a fountain feeds, Shine, disembower'd, and give to sun and breeze Their virgin waters; the full region leads New colonies forth, that toward the western seas Spread, like a rapid flame among the autumnal trees. Here the free spirit of mankind at length Throws its last fetters off; and who shall place A limit to the giant's unchain'd strength, Or curb his swiftness in the forward race. Far, like the comet's way through infinite space, Stretches the long untravell'd path of light Into the depths of ages: we may trace, Afar, the brightening glory of its flight, Till the receding rays are lost to human sight. Europe is given a prey to sterner fates, And writhes in shackles; strong the arms that chain To earth her struggling multitude of states; She too is strong, and might not chafe in vain Against them, but shake off the vampyre train That batten on her blood, and break their net. Yes, she shall look on brighter days, and gain The meed of worthier deeds; the moment set To rescue and raise up, draws near—but is not yet. But thou, my country, thou shalt never fall, But with thy children—thy maternal care, Thy lavish love, thy blessings shower'd on all— These are thy fetters—seas and stormy air Are the wide barrier of thy borders, where Among thy gallant sons that guard thee well, Thou laugh'st at enemies: who shall then declare The date of thy deep-founded strength, or tell How happy, in thy lap, the sons of men shall dwell. THANATOPSIS. To him who in the love of Nature holds Communion with her visible forms, she speaks A various language; for his gayer hours She has a voice of gladness, and a smile And eloquence of beauty, and she glides Into his darker musings, with a mild And gentle sympathy, that steals away Their sharpness, ere he is aware. When thoughts Of the last bitter hour come like a blight Over thy spirit, and sad images Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall, And breathless darkness, and the narrow house, Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;— Go forth, unto the open sky, and list To Nature's teachings, while from all around— Earth and her waters, and the depths of air,— Comes a still voice—Yet a few days, and thee The all-beholding sun shall see no more In all his course; nor yet in the cold ground, Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears, Nor in the embrace of ocean shall exist Thy image. Earth, that nourish'd thee, shall claim Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again; And, lost each human trace, surrendering up Thine individual being, shalt thou go To mix for ever with the elements, To be a brother to th' insensible rock And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mould. Yet not to thy eternal resting place Shalt thou retire alone—nor couldst thou wish Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down With patriarchs of the infant world—with kings The powerful of the earth—the wise, the good, Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past, All in one mighty sepulchre.—The hills Rock-ribb'd and ancient as the sun,—the vales Stretching in pensive quietness between; The venerable woods—rivers that move In majesty, and the complaining brooks That make the meadows green; and pour'd round all, Old ocean's grey and melancholy waste,— Are but the solemn decorations all Of the great tomb of man. The golden sun, The planets, all the infinite host of heaven, Are shining on the sad abodes of death, Through the still lapse of ages. All that tread The globe are but a handful to the tribes That slumber in its bosom.—Take the wings Of morning—and the Barcan desert pierce, Or lose thyself in the continuous woods Where rolls the Oregan, and hears no sound, Save his own dashings—yet—the dead are there, And millions in those solitudes, since first The flight of years began, have laid them down In their last sleep—the dead reign there alone.— So shalt thou rest—and what if thou shalt fall Unnoticed by the living—and no friend Take note of thy departure? All that breathe Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care Plod on, and each one as before will chase His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave Their mirth and their employments, and shall come, And make their bed with thee. As the long train Of ages glide away, the sons of men, The youth in life's green spring, and he who goes In the full strength of years, matron, and maid, The bow'd with age, the infant in the smiles And beauty of its innocent age cut off,— Shall one by one be gather'd to thy side, By those, who in their turn shall follow them. So live, that when thy summons comes to join The innumerable caravan, that moves To the pale realms of shade, where each shall take His chamber in the silent halls of death, Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night, Scourged to his dungeon, but sustain'd and soothed By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave, Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams. TO A WATERFOWL. Whither, 'midst falling dew, While glow the heavens with the last steps of day Far, through their rosy depths, dost thou pursue Thy solitary way? Vainly the fowler's eye Might mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong, As, darkly painted on the crimson sky, Thy figure floats along. Seek'st thou the plashy brink Of weedy lake, or marge of river wide, Or where the rocking billows rise and sink On the chafed ocean side? There is a Power whose care Teaches thy way along that pathless coast,— The desert and illimitable air,— Lone wandering, but not lost. All day thy wings have fann'd At that far height, the cold thin atmosphere; Yet stoop not, weary, to the welcome land, Though the dark night is near. And soon that toil shall end, Soon shalt thou find a summer home, and rest, And scream among thy fellows; reeds shall bend Soon o'er thy shelter'd nest. Thou 'rt gone, the abyss of heaven Hath swallow'd up thy form; yet, on my heart Deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given, And shall not soon depart. He, who, from zone to zone, Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight, In the long way that I must tread alone, Will lead my steps aright. THE MURDERED TRAVELLER. When spring to woods and wastes around, Brought bloom and joy again, The murder'd traveller's bones were found, Far down a narrow glen. The fragrant birch, above him, hung Her tassels in the sky; And many a vernal blossom sprung, And nodded, careless, by. The red-bird warbled, as he wrought His hanging nest o'erhead, And fearless near the fatal spot, Her young the partridge led. But there was weeping far away, And gentle eyes, for him, With watching many an anxious day, Grew sorrowful and dim. They little knew, who loved him so, The fearful death he met, When shouting o'er the desert snow, Unarm'd, and hard beset;— Nor how, when round the frosty pole The northern dawn was red, The mountain wolf and wild-cat stole To banquet on the dead;— Nor how, when strangers found his bones, They dress'd the hasty bier, And mark'd his grave with nameless stones, Unmoisten'd by a tear. But long they look'd, and fear'd, and wept, Within his distant home; And dream'd, and started as they slept, For joy that he was come. So long they look'd—but never spied His welcome step again, Nor knew the fearful death he died Far down that narrow glen. AN INDIAN STORY. I know where the timid fawn abides In the depths of the shaded dell, Where the leaves are broad and the thicket hides, With its many stems and its tangled sides, From the eye of the hunter well. I know where the young May violet grows, In its lone and lowly nook, On the mossy bank, where the larch tree throws Its broad dark boughs, in solemn repose, Far over the silent brook. And that timid fawn starts not with fear When I steal to her secret bower, And that young May violet to me is dear, And I visit the silent streamlet near, To look on the lovely flower. Thus Maquon sings as he lightly walks To the hunting ground on the hills; 'T is a song of his maid of the woods and rocks, With her bright black eyes and long black locks, And voice like the music of rills. He goes to the chase—but evil eyes Are at watch in the thicker shades; For she was lovely that smiled on his sighs, And he bore, from a hundred lovers, his prize, The flower of the forest maids. The boughs in the morning wind are stirr'd, And the woods their song renew, With the early carol of many a bird, And the quicken'd tune of the streamlet heard Where the hazels trickle with dew. And Maquon has promised his dark-hair'd maid, Ere eve shall redden the sky, A good red deer from the forest shade, That bounds with the herd through grove and glade, At her cabin door shall lie. The hollow woods, in the setting sun, Ring shrill with the fire-bird's lay; And Maquon's sylvan labors are done, And his shafts are spent, but the spoil they won He bears on his homeward way. He stops near his bower—his eye perceives Strange traces along the ground— At once, to the earth his burden he heaves, He breaks through the veil of boughs and leaves, And gains its door with a bound. But the vines are torn on its walls that leant, And all from the young shrubs there By struggling hands have the leaves been rent, And there hangs, on the sassafras broken and bent, One tress of the well known hair. But where is she who at this calm hour, Ever watch'd his coming to see, She is not at the door, nor yet in the bower, He calls—but he only hears on the flower The hum of the laden bee. It is not a time for idle grief, Nor a time for tears to flow, The horror that freezes his limbs is brief— He grasps his war axe and bow, and a sheaf Of darts made sharp for the foe. And he looks for the print of the ruffian's feet, Where he bore the maiden away; And he darts on the fatal path more fleet Than the blast that hurries the vapor and sleet O'er the wild November day. 'T was early summer when Maquon's bride Was stolen away from his door; But at length the maples in crimson are dyed, And the grape is black on the cabin side,— And she smiles at his hearth once more. But far in a pine grove, dark and cold, Where the yellow leaf falls not, Nor the autumn shines in scarlet and gold, There lies a hillock of fresh dark mould, In the deepest gloom of the spot. And the Indian girls, that pass way, Point out the ravisher's grave;— “And how soon to the bower she loved,” they say, “Return'd the maid that was borne away From Maquon, the fond and the brave.” HYMN TO THE NORTH STAR. The sad and solemn night Has yet her multitude of cheerful fires; The glorious host of light Walk the dark hemisphere till she retires: All through her silent watches, gliding slow, Her constellations come, and round the heavens, and go. Day, too, hath many a star To grace his gorgeous reign, as bright as they: Through the blue fields afar, Unseen, they follow in his flaming way: Many a bright lingerer, as the eve grows dim, Tells what a radiant troop arose and set with him. And thou dost see them rise, Star of the Pole! and thou dost see them set. Alone, in thy cold skies, Thou keep'st thy old unmoving station yet, Nor join'st the dances of that glittering train, Nor dipp'st thy virgin orb in the blue western main. There, at morn's rosy birth, Thou lookest meekly through the kindling air, And eve, that round the earth Chases the day, beholds thee watching there; There noontide finds thee, and the hour that calls The shapes of polar flame to scale heaven's azure walls. Alike, beneath thine eye, The deeds of darkness and of light are done; High towards the star-lit sky Towns blaze—the smoke of battle blots the sun— The night-storm on a thousand hills is loud— And the strong wind of day doth mingle sea and cloud. On thy unaltering blaze The half-wreck'd mariner, his compass lost, Fixes his steady gaze, And steers, undoubting, to the friendly coast; And they who stray in perilous wastes, by night, Are glad when thou dost shine to guide their footsteps right. And, therefore, bards of old, Sages, and hermits of the solemn wood, Did in thy beams behold A beauteous type of that unchanging good, That bright eternal beacon, by whose ray The voyager of time should shape his heedful way. SONG OF THE STARS. When the radiant morn of creation broke, And the world in the smile of God awoke, And the empty realms of darkness and death Were moved through their depths by his mighty breath, And orbs of beauty, and spheres of flame, From the void abyss, by myriads came, In the joy of youth, as they darted away, Through the widening wastes of space to play, Their silver voices in chorus rung, And this was the song the bright ones sung. Away, away, through the wide, wide sky, The fair blue fields that before us lie: Each sun with the worlds that round us roll, Each planet poised on her turning pole, With her isles of green, and her clouds of white, And her waters that lie like fluid light. For the source of glory uncovers his face, And the brightness o'erflows unbounded space; And we drink, as we go, the luminous tides In our ruddy air and our blooming sides; Lo, yonder the living splendors play! Away, on our joyous path away! Look, look, through our glittering ranks afar, In the infinite azure, star after star, How they brighten and bloom as they swiftly pass! How the verdure runs o'er each rolling mass! And the path of the gentle winds is seen, Where the small waves dance, and the young woods lean. And see, where the brighter day-beams pour, How the rainbows hang in the sunny shower; And the morn and the eve, with their pomp of hues, Shift o'er the bright planets and shed their dews; And 'twixt them both, o'er the teeming ground, With her shadowy cone, the night goes round. Away, away!—in our blossoming bowers, In the soft air wrapping these spheres of ours, In the seas and fountains that shine with morn, See, love is brooding, and life is born, And breathing myriads are breaking from night, To rejoice, like us, in motion and light. Glide on in your beauty, ye youthful spheres! To weave the dance that measures the years. Glide on in the glory and gladness sent To the farthest wall of the firmament, The boundless visible smile of him To the veil of whose brow our lamps are dim. AUTUMN WOODS. Ere, in the northern gale, The summer tresses of the trees are gone, The woods of autumn, all around our vale, Have put their glory on. The mountains that infold In their wide sweep, the color'd landscape round, Seem groups of giant kings in purple and gold, That guard the enchanted ground. I roam the woods that crown The upland, where the mingled splendors glow, Where the gay company of trees look down On the green fields below. My steps are not alone In these bright walks; the sweet southwest, at play, Flies, rustling, where the painted leaves are strown Along the winding way. And far in heaven, the while, The sun, that sends that gale to wander here, Pours out on the fair earth his quiet smile,— The sweetest of the year. Where now the solemn shade, Verdure and gloom where many branches meet; So grateful, when the noon of summer made The valleys sick with heat? Let in through all the trees Come the strange rays; the forest depths are bright; Their sunny-color'd foliage, in the breeze, Twinkles, like beams of light. The rivulet, late unseen, Where bickering through the shrubs its waters run, Shines with the image of its golden screen, And glimmerings of the sun. But, 'neath yon crimson tree, Lover to listening maid might breathe his flame, Nor mark, within its roseate canopy, Her blush of maiden shame. Oh, Autumn! why so soon Depart the hues that make thy forests glad; Thy gentle wind and thy fair sunny noon, And leave thee wild and sad! Ah, 't were a lot too blest For ever in thy color'd shades to stray Amidst the kisses of the soft southwest To rove and dream for aye; And leave the vain low strife That makes men mad—the tug for wealth and power, The passions and the cares that wither life, And waste its little hour. THE CLOSE OF AUTUMN. The melancholy days are come, the saddest of the year, Of wailing winds and naked woods and meadows brown and sere. Heap'd in the hollows of the grove the wither'd leaves lie dead, They rustle to the eddying gust and to the rabbit's tread. The robin and the wren are flown, and from the shrubs the jay, And from the wood top calls the crow, through all the gloomy day. Where are the flowers, the fair young flowers, that lately sprung and stood, In brighter light and softer airs, a beauteous sisterhood? Alas! they all are in their graves—the gentle race of flowers Are lying in their lowly beds, with the fair and good of ours: The rain is falling where they lie—but the cold November rain Calls not from out the gloomy earth the lovely ones again. The windflower and the violet, they perish'd long ago, And the brier-rose and the orchis died, amid the summer's glow; But on the hill the golden rod, and the aster in the wood, And the yellow sunflower by the brook in autumn beauty stood, Till fell the frost from the clear cold heaven, as falls the plague on men, And the brightness of their smile was gone from upland, glade, and glen. And now when comes the calm mild day—as still such days will come, To call the squirrel and the bee from out their winter home; When the sound of dropping nuts is heard, though all the trees are still, And twinkle in the smoky light the waters of the rill, The south wind searches for the flowers whose fragrance late he bore, And sighs to find them in the wood and by the stream no more. And then I think of one who in her youthful beauty died, The fair meek blossom that grew up and faded by my side. In the cold moist earth we laid her, when the forest cast the leaf, And we wept that one so lovely should have a lot so brief; Yet not unmeet it was, that one, like that young friend of ours, So gentle and so beautiful, should perish with the flowers. SAMUEL WEBBER LOGAN. Ten suns upon the woods had shone, Ten times the evening star had thrown The lustre of its steady ray Through the dim shades of closing day, Ere Logan turn'd him from the chase, His wandering footsteps to retrace. Of all the scenes through which he pass'd, By far the loveliest was the last. Beyond his mid-day bound the sun Upon his circling course had run, And on the forest's top his rays Pour'd in one broad unbroken blaze, Yet fail'd to pierce the leafy screen, Whose canopy of living green High o'er the forest's vast arcade Spread its thick, deeply tinted shade. Beneath was stern and solemn gloom, As in some vast and vaulted tomb. There rose the towering trunks, whose pride The shock of ages had defied; Vast as the pillar'd shafts that stand 'Mid Egypt's ever shifting sand, Where Carnac's ruins rise sublime, Mocking the feeble hand of Time. Far from the earth they rose on high, In straight, unbroken symmetry, Then spread at once their branches wide, Where bough met bough on every side, And from the upward gazing eye Shut the blue glimpses of the sky. Beneath no humbler growth was found With tangled copse to hide the ground, But at their roots the greensward lay, And flowers that loved the dubious day; No sound was wafted on the air To break the stillness slumbering there, Save the deep moaning of the breeze That struggled mid the mighty trees, And more than stillness o'er the mind Threw feelings deep by awe refined. There Logan pass'd, towards the west With firm unwavering course he press'd, Till through the trunks upon his sight Pour'd the full blaze of golden light; With swifter step he hurried on, And soon the forest's boundary won. Great was the contrast then! the wood Behind in gloomy grandeur stood; A spacious plain before him lay Bright with the cheering beams of day. Far westward stretch'd, in vain the eye Its distant limits would descry; By woods on either side embraced, It seem'd a lake of verdure placed Amid that dark and gloomy wild, Where scarce a wandering sun-beam smiled. The western breeze with balmy sigh Waved the tall grass of sunny dye, Whose undulations rose and fell Like ocean's soft and vernal swell, When poets feign'd upon its breast The wave-nursed Halcyon's floating nest. Amid that verdant lake appear'd, Like islands 'mid the billows rear'd, Dark tufted groves, the cool retreat Of wild deer from the noontide heat. There stretch'd amid the breezy shade The timid foresters were laid, Or bounded o'er the plain as light As the swift swallow's sportive flight. —All now was light and life, the ear A softly murmuring sound might hear, As Nature's various voices join'd With notes of harmony combined. The whispering grass, the rustling tree, The mellow humming of the bee, The buzz of insect tribes, in play And sunshine sporting life away, Floating upon the fragrant air, As if to feed on odors there. Slow sunk the sun, and twilight deep Lull'd all that loved his ray to sleep. 'Mid gorgeous clouds that robed the west The sun was sinking to his rest. When Logan reach'd his home, with toil Nigh wearied and his forest spoil. While on a hill-top far aloof, With straining gaze he mark'd the roof, To see if through its crevice broke The faint blue wreath of evening smoke, That oft his longing heart had cheer'd, When first in distance it appear'd, And spoke of welcome that should greet His safe return with pleasure meet. —In vain! the thin, transparent air, Unstain'd by vapor, rested there. How could this be! the new moon's bow But once had shed its silver glow, When from her home Oana went, And ere one half its course was spent She promised to return again; —But now the moon was in its wane, And scarcely half her orbed face Lent to the night a mournful grace. At other time this had been nought, But now of late to anxious thought, And undefined, his mind was prone; More than himself would lightly own. He reach'd his hut, the door was closed, Within in stillness all reposed As when he left it, not a change Was there, but sameness still and strange; As if no hand had oped the door, Or footstep cross'd the threshold floor. He sate him down in silence stern, Wishing, yet fearful too, to learn What evil tidings might await, —Why thus his home was desolate. He heard a footstep, at his door One enter'd, one well known before, Of firm, unfailing friendship proved In times that faithless hearts had moved. Then Logan mann'd himself to bear All he might hear with unmoved air. ‘With thee be peace!’ the chieftain said, His friend the greeting fair repaid. Logan look'd keenly in his face, As if he sought his thoughts to trace. —Vainly; all there was cold and still As midnight on the ice bound rill. A moment's pause, then calm and brief The visitant address'd the chief. ‘Logan, I bring thee tidings dread, The storm of war above thy head Has burst, and thou art left alone, For to the land of souls are gone Thy children and thy wife,’—no more. The flash that wakes the tempest's roar, Bursting around the wanderer's head With sheeted flames and thunder dread, Scarcely each shrinking sense confounds, As Logan's now these dreadful sounds. As one upon a rugged steep, High beetling o'er the roaring deep, Supported by some slender vine Whose tendrils round the rocks entwine, Feels when it breaks, and far beneath He plunges living into death, So Logan felt, his mind was toss'd, In chaos and confusion lost, His brain whirl'd dizzily, and sight, And sense, and thought were banish'd quite. All hope was reft, and far below Roll'd the deep gulf of rayless wo. Joys that had been, and those that he Had fondly thought in time should be, —All he had lost, together came Bursting upon his mind like flame, With the dread sense that nought could save Or rush between them and the grave. —'T was but an instant; like the light Of meteor darting through the night, So swiftly that the gazer's eye Scarce marks it as it passes by, Vanish'd that tempest of the soul, Which then resumed its self-control, Struggling each outward sign to hide Of softness that might shame his pride, And stain his lofty, warrior fame With weakness of unmanly name. ‘'T is well,’ he said and paused,—the tone Firm and majestic was his own; His tearless eye was calm and bright, His dark lip show'd no tinge of white, And his whole mien was self possess'd As if no passion stirr'd his breast. LEVI FRISBIE MORNING HYMN. While nature welcomes in the day, My heart its earliest vows would pay To Him whose care hath kindly kept My life from danger while I slept. His genial rays the sun renews; How bright the scene with glittering dews! The blushing flowers more beauteous bloom, And breathe more rich their sweet perfume. So may the Sun of righteousness With kindliest beams my bosom bless, Warm into life each heavenly seed, To bud and bear some generous deed. So may the dews of grace distil And gently soften all my will, So may my morning sacrifice To heaven a grateful incense rise. Wilt Thou this day my footsteps guide, And kindly all I need provide, With strength divine my bosom arm Against temptation's powerful charm. Where'er I am, oh may I feel That God is all around me still, That all I say, or do, or mean; By his all-searching eye is seen. Oh may each day my heart improve, Increase my faith, my hope, my love, And thus its shades around me close More wise and holy than I rose. EVENING HYMN. My soul, a hymn of evening praise To God, thy kind preserver, raise, Whose hand this day hath guarded, fed And thousand blessings round me shed. Forgive my sins this day, Oh Lord, In thought or feeling, deed or word; And if in aught thy law I've kept, My feeble efforts Lord accept. While nature round is hush'd to rest, Let no vain thought disturb my breast; Shed o'er my soul religion's power, Serenely solemn as the hour. Oh bid thy angels o'er me keep Their watch to shield me while I sleep, Till the fresh morn shall round me break, Then with new vigor may I wake. Yet think, my soul, another day Of thy short course has roll'd away; Ah think how soon in deepening shade Thy day of life itself shall fade. How soon death's sleep my eyes must close Lock every sense in dread repose, And lay me 'mid the awful gloom And solemn silence of the tomb. This very night, Lord, should it be, Oh may my soul repose in thee, Till the glad morn in heaven shall rise, Then wake to triumph in the skies. DREAM. TO ??? Stay, stay, sweet vision, do not leave me— Soft sleep, still o'er my senses reign; Stay, loveliest phantom, still deceive me; Ah! let me dream that dream again. Thy head was on my shoulder leaning; Thy hand in mine was gently prest; Thine eyes so soft and full of meaning, Were bent on me and I was blest. No word was spoken, all was feeling, The silent transport of the heart; The tear that o'er my cheek was stealing; Told what words could ne'er impart. And could this be but mere illusion? Could fancy all so real seem? Here fancy's scenes are wild confusion— And can it be I did but dream. I'm sure I felt thy forehead pressing, Thy very breath stole o'er my cheek, I'm sure I saw those eyes confessing What the tongue could never speak. Ah! no, 't is gone, 't is gone, and never Mine such waking bliss can be; Oh I would sleep, would sleep for ever, Could I thus but dream of thee. MRS LITTLE THANKSGIVING. It is thanksgiving morn—'t is cold and clear; The bells for church ring forth a merry sound; The maidens, in their gaudy winter gear, Rival the many-tinted woods around; The rosy children skip along the ground, Save where the matron reins their eager pace, Pointing to him who with a look profound Moves with his ‘people’ toward the sacred place Where duly he bestows the manna crumbs of grace. Of the deep learning in the schools of yore The reverend pastor hath a golden stock: Yet, with a vain display of useless lore, Or sapless doctrine, never will he mock The better cravings of his simple flock; But faithfully their humble shepherd guides Where streams eternal gush from Calvary's rock, For well he knows, not learning's purest tides Can quench the immortal thirst that in the soul abides. The anthem swells; the heart's high thanks are given: Then, mildly as the dews on Hermon fall, Begins the holy minister of heaven. And though not his the burning zeal of Paul, Yet a persuasive power is in his call; So earnest, though so kindly, is his mood, So tenderly he longs to save them all, No bird more fondly flutters o'er her brood, When the dark vulture screams above their native wood. “For all his bounties, dearest charge,” he cries, “Your hearts are the best thanks; no more refrain; Your yielded hearts he asks in sacrifice. Almighty Lover! shalt thou love in vain; And vainly woo thy wand'rers home again? How thy soft mercy with the sinner pleads! Behold! thy harvest loads the ample plain; And the same goodness lives in all thy deeds, From the least drop of rain, to those that Jesus bleeds.” Much more he spake, with growing ardor fired; Oh that my lay were worthy to record The moving eloquence his theme inspired! For like a free and copious stream outpour'd His love to man and man's indulgent Lord. All were subdued; the stoutest, sternest men, Heart-melted, hung on every precious word: And as he utter'd forth his full amen, A thousand mingling sobs re-echoed it again. Behold that ancient house on yonder lawn, Close by whose rustic porch an elm is seen: Lo! now has past the service of the morn; A joyous group are hastening o'er the green, Led by an aged sire of gracious mien, Whose gay descendants are all met to hold Their glad thanksgiving in that sylvan scene, That once enclosed them in one happy fold, Ere waves of time and change had o'er them roll'd. The hospitable doors are open thrown; The bright wood-fire burns cheerly in the hall; And, gathering in, a busy hum makes known The spirit of free mirth that moves them all. There, a youth hears a lovely cousin's call, And flies alertly to unclasp the cloak; And she, the while, with merry laugh lets fall Upon his awkwardness some lively joke, Not pitying the blush her bantering has woke. And there the grandam sits, in placid ease, A gentle brightness o'er her features spread: Her children's children cluster round her knees, Or on her bosom fondly rest their head. Oh, happy sight, to see such blossoms shed Their sweet young fragrance o'er such aged tree! How vain to say, that, when short youth has fled, Our dearest of enjoyments cease to be; When hoary eld is loved but the more tenderly. And there the manly farmers scan the news; (Strong is their sense, though plain the garb it wears;) Or, while their pipes a lulling smoke diffuse, They look important from their elbow chairs, And gravely ponder on the nation's cares. The matrons of the morning sermon speak, And each its passing excellence declares; While tears of pious rapture, pure and meek, Course in soft beauty down the christian mother's cheek. Then, just at one, the full thanksgiving feast, Rich with the bounties of the closing year, Is spread; and, from the greatest to the least, All crowd the table, and enjoy the cheer. The list of dainties will not now appear; Save one I cannot pass unheeded by, One dish, already to the muses dear, One dish, that wakens memory's longing sigh— The genuine far famed Yankee pumpkin pie. Who e'er has seen thee in thy flaky crust Display the yellow richness of thy breast, But, as the sight awoke his keenest gust, Has own'd thee of all cates the choicest, best? Ambrosia were a fool, to thee compared, Even by the ruby hand of Hebe drest; Thee, pumpkin pie, by country maids prepared, With their white rounded arms above the elbow bared. Now to the kitchen come a vagrant train, The plenteous fragments of the feast to share. The old lame fiddler wakes a merry strain, For his mull'd cider and his pleasant fare,— Reclining in that ancient wicker chair. A veteran soldier he, of those proud times When first our freedom's banner kiss'd the air: His battles oft he sings in untaught rhymes, When wakening memory his aged heart sublimes. But who is this, whose scarlet cloak has known Full oft the pelting of the winter storm? Through its fringed hood a strong wild face is shown,— Tall, gaunt, and bent with years, the beldam's form;— There 's none of all these youth with vigor warm, Who dare by slightest word her anger stir. So dark the frown that does her face deform, That half the frighted villagers aver The very de'il himself incarnate is in her. Yet now the sybil wears her mildest mood; And round her see the anxious silent band. Falls from her straggling locks the antique hood, As close she peers in that fair maiden's hand, Who scarce the struggles in her heart can stand; Affection's strength has made her nature weak; She of her lovely looks hath lost command; The flecker'd red and white within her cheek— Oh, all her love it doth most eloquently speak! Thy doting faith, fond maid, may envied be, And half excused the superstitious art. Now, when the sybil's mystic words to thee The happier fortunes of thy love impart, Thrilling thy soul in its most vital part, How does the throb of inward ecstacy Send the luxuriant blushes from thy heart All o'er thy varying cheek, like some clear sea Where the red morning-glow falls full but tremblingly? 'T is evening; and the rural ball begins: The fairy call of music all obey; The circles round domestic hearths grow thin; All, at the joyful signal, hie away To yonder hall with lights and garlands gay. There, with elastic step, young belles are seen Entering, all conscious of their coming sway: Not oft their fancies underrate, I ween, The spoils and glories of this festal scene. New England's daughters need not envy those Who in a monarch's court their jewels wear; More lovely they, when but a simple rose Glows through the golden clusters of their hair. Could light of diamonds make her look more fair, Who moves in beauty through the mazy dance, With buoyant feet that seem'd to skim the air, And eyes that speak, in each impassion'd glance, The poetry of youth, love's sweet and short romance? He thinks not so, that young enamor'd boy Who through the dance her graceful steps doth guide, While his heart swells with the deep pulse of joy. Oh, no; by nature taught, unlearnt in pride, He sees her in her loveliness array'd, All blushing for the love she cannot hide; And feels that gaudy art could only shade The brightness nature gave to his unrivall'd maid. Gay bands, move on; your draught of pleasure quaff; I love to listen to your joyous din; The lad's light joke, the maiden's mellow laugh, And the brisk music of the violin. How blithe to see the sprightly dance begin! Entwining hands, they seem to float along, With native rustic grace that well might win The happiest praises of a sweeter song, From a more gifted lyre than doth to me belong. While these enjoy the mirth that suits their years, Round the home-fires their peaceful elders meet. A gentler mirth their friendly converse cheers; And yet, though calm their pleaures, they are sweet Through the cold shadows of the autumn day Oft breaks the sunshine with as genial heat, As o'er the soft and sapphire skies of May, Though nature then be young and exquisitely gay. On the white wings of peace their days have flown; Nor wholly were they thrall'd by earthly cares; But from their hearts to heaven's paternal throne Arose the daily incense of their prayers. And now, as low the sun of being wears, The God to whom their morning vows were paid, Each grateful offering in remembrance bears;— And cheering beams of mercy are display'd, To gild with heavenly hopes their evening's pensive shade But now, farewell to thee, thanksgiving day! Thou angel of the year! one bounteous hand The horn of deep abundance doth display, Raining its rich profusion o'er the land; The other arm, outstretch'd with gesture grand, Pointing its upraised finger to the sky, Doth the warm tribute of our thanks demand For Him, the Father God, who from on high Sheds gleams of purest joy o'er man's dark destiny. FITZ-GREENE HALLECK [There have been loftier themes than his] The attribution of this poem is uncertain. “There have been loftier themes than his, And longer scrolls, and louder lyres, And lays lit up with poesy's Purer and holier fires: Yet read the names that know not death; Few nobler ones than his are there; And few have won a greener wreath Than that which binds his hair.” ALNWICK CASTLE. Home of the Percys' high-born race, Home of their beautiful and brave, Alike their birth and burial place, Their cradle, and their grave! Still sternly o'er the Castle gate Their house's Lion stands in state, As in his proud departed hours; And warriors frown in stone on high, And feudal banners “flout the sky” Above his princely towers. A gentle hill its side inclines, Lovely in England's fadeless green, To meet the quiet stream which winds Through this romantic scene As silently and sweetly still, As when, at evening, on that hill, While summer's wind blew soft and low, Seated by gallant Hotspur's side, His Katharine was a happy bride, A thousand years ago. Gaze on the Abbey's ruin'd pile: Does not the succoring Ivy, keeping Her watch around it, seem to smile, As o'er a loved one sleeping? One solitary turret gray Still tells, in melancholy glory, The legend of the Cheviot day, The Percys' proudest border story. That day its roof was triumph's arch; Then rang, from aisle to pictured dome, The light step of the soldier's march, The music of the trump and drum; And babe and sire, the old, the young, And the monk's hymn, and minstrel's song, And woman's pure kiss, sweet and long, Welcomed her warrior home. Wild roses by the Abbey towers Are gay in their young bud and bloom: They were born of a race of funeral flowers That garlanded, in long-gone hours, A Templar's knightly tomb. He died, the sword in his mailed hand, On the holiest spot of the Blessed Land, Where the Cross was damp'd with his dying breath: When blood ran free as festal wine, And the sainted air of Palestine Was thick with the darts of death. Wise with the lore of centuries, What tales, if there be “tongues in trees,” Those giant oaks could tell, Of beings born and buried here; Tales of the peasant and the peer, Tales of the bridal and the bier, The welcome and farewell, Since on their boughs the startled bird First, in her twilight slumbers, heard The Norman's curfew bell. I wandered through the lofty halls Trod by the Percys of old fame, And traced upon the chapel walls Each high, heroic name, From him who once his standard set Where now, o'er mosque and minaret, Glitter the Sultan's crescent moons; To him who, when a younger son, Fought for King George at Lexington, A Major of Dragoons. That last half stanza—it has dashed From my warm lip the sparkling cup; The light that o'er my eye-beam flash'd, The power that bore my spirit up Above this bank-note world—is gone; And Alnwick's but a market town, And this, alas! its market day, And beasts and borderers throng the way; Oxen, and bleating lambs in lots, Northumbrian boors, and plaided Scots; Men in the coal and cattle line, From Teviot's bard and hero land, From royal Berwick's beach of sand, From Wooller, Morpeth, Hexham, and Newcastle-upon-Tyne. These are not the romantic times So beautiful in Spenser's rhymes, So dazzling to the dreaming boy: Ours are the days of fact, not fable; Of Knights, but not of the Round Table; Of Bailie Jarvie, not Rob Roy: 'T is what “our President,” Monroe, Has call'd “the era of good feeling:” The Highlander, the bitterest foe To modern laws, has felt their blow, Consented to be tax'd, and vote, And put on pantaloons and coat, And leave off cattle stealing; Lord Stafford mines for coal and salt, The duke of Norfolk deals in malt, The Douglas in red herrings; And noble name, and cultured land, Palace, and park, and vassal band Are powerless to the notes of hand Of Rothschild, or the Barings. The age of bargaining, said Burke, Has come: today the turban'd Turk, (Sleep, Richard, of the lion heart! Sleep on, nor from your cerements start,) Is England's friend and fast ally; The Moslem tramples on the Greek, And on the Cross and altar stone, And Christendom looks tamely on, And hears the Christian maiden shriek, And sees the Christian father die; And not a sabre blow is given For Greece and fame, for faith and heaven, By Europe's craven chivalry. You'll ask if yet the Percy lives In the armed pomp of feudal state? The present representatives Of Hotspur and his “gentle Kate,” Are some half dozen serving men, In the drab coat of William Penn; A chambermaid, whose lip and eye, And cheek, and brown hair, bright and curling, Spoke Nature's aristocracy; And one, half groom half Seneschal, Who bow'd me through court, bower, and hall, From donjon keep to turret wall, For ten-and-sixpence sterling. MARCO BOZZARIS. At midnight, in his guarded tentt, The Turk was dreaming of the hour When Greece, her knee in suppliance bent, Should tremble at his power: In dreams, through camp and court, he bore The trophies of a conqueror; In dreams his song of triumph heard; Then wore his monarch's signet ring: Then press'd that monarch's throne,—a king; As wild his thoughts, and gay of wing, As Eden's garden bird. At midnight, in the forest shades, Bozzaris ranged his Suliote band, True as the steel of their tried blades, Heroes in heart and hand. There had the Persian's thousands stood, There had the glad earth drunk their blood On old Platæa's day; And now there breathed that haunted air The sons of sires who conquer'd there, With arm to strike, and soul to dare, As quick, as far as they. An hour pass'd on—The Turk awoke; That bright dream was his last; He woke—to hear his sentries shriek, “To arms! they come! the Greek! the Greek!” He woke—to die 'midst flame, and smoke, And shout, and groan, and sabre stroke, And death shots falling thick and fast As lightnings from the mountain cloud; And heard with voice as trumpet loud, Bozzaris cheer his band: “Strike—till the last arm'd foe expires; Strike—for your altars and your fires; Strike—for the green graves of your sires; God—and your native land!” They fought—like brave men, long and well; They piled that ground with Moslem slain; They conquer'd—but Bozzaris fell, Bleeding at every vein. His few surviving comrades saw His smile when rang their proud hurrah, And the red field was won; Then saw in death his eyelids close Calmly, as to a night's repose, Like flowers at set of sun. Come to the bridal chamber, Death! Come to the mother's, when she feels, For the first time, her first born's breath; Come when the blessed seals That close the pestilence are broke, And crowded cities wail its stroke; Come in consumption's ghastly form, The earthquake shock, the ocean storm; Come when the heart beats high and warm, With banquet-song, and dance, and wine; And thou art terrible—the tear, The groan, the knell, the pall, the bier; And all we know, or dream, or fear Of agony, are thine. But to the hero, when his sword Has won the battle for the free, Thy voice sounds like a prophet's word; And in its hollow tones are heard The thanks of millions yet to be. Come, when his task of fame is wrought— Come, with her laurel-leaf, blood-bought— Come in her crowning hour—and then Thy sunken eye's unearthly light To him is welcome as the sight Of sky and stars to prison'd men: Thy grasp is welcome as the hand Of brother in a foreign land; Thy summons welcome as the cry That told the Indian isles were nigh To the world-seeking Genoese, When the land wind, from woods of palm, And orange groves, and fields of balm, Blew o'er the Haytian seas. Bozzaris! with the storied brave Greece nurtured in her glory's time, Rest thee—there is no prouder grave, Even in her own proud clime. She wore no funeral weeds for thee, Nor bade the dark hearse wave its plume, Like torn branch from death's leafless tree, In sorrow's pomp and pageantry, The heartless luxury of the tomb: But she remembers thee as one Long loved, and for a season gone; For thee her poet's lyre is wreathed, Her marble wrought, her music breathed; For thee she rings her birth-day bells; Of thee her babes' first lisping tells; For thine her evening prayer is said At palace couch, and cottage bed; Her soldier, closing with the foe, Gives for thy sake a deadlier blow; His plighted maiden, when she fears For him, the joy of her young years, Thinks of thy fate, and checks her tears: And she, the mother of thy boys, Though in her eye and faded cheek Is read the grief she will not speak, The memory of her buried joys, And even she who gave thee birth, Will, by their pilgrim-circled hearth, Talk of thy doom without a sigh: For thou art Freedom's now, and Fame's; One of the few, the immortal names, That were not born to die. TO ???? The world is bright before thee, Its summer flowers are thine, Its calm blue sky is o'er thee, Thy bosom Pleasure's shrine; And thine the sunbeam given To Nature's morning hour, Pure, warm, as when from heaven It burst on Eden's bower. There is a song of sorrow, The death-dirge of the gay, That tells, ere dawn of morrow, These charms may melt away, That sun's bright beam be shaded, That sky be blue no more, The summer flowers be faded, And youth's warm promise o'er. Believe it not—though lonely Thy evening home may be; Though Beauty's bark can only Float on a summer sea; Though Time thy bloom is stealing. There 's still beyond his art The wild-flower wreath of feeling, The sunbeam of the heart. LOVE. —The imperial votaress pass'd on In maiden meditation, fancy free. Midsummer Night's Dream.

When the tree of love is budding first, Ere yet its leaves are green, Ere yet, by shower and sunbeam nurst Its infant life has been; The wild bee's slightest touch might wring The buds from off the tree, As the gentle dip of the swallow's wing Breaks the bubbles on the sea. But when its open leaves have found A home in the free air, Pluck them, and there remains a wound That ever rankles there. The blight of hope and happiness Is felt when fond ones part, And the bitter tear that follows is The life-blood of the heart. When the flame of love is kindled first, 'T is the fire-fly's light at even, 'T is dim as the wandering stars that burst In the blue of the summer heaven. A breath can bid it burn no more, Or if, at times, its beams Come on the memory, they pass o'er Like shadows in our dreams. But when that flame has blazed into A being and a power, And smiled in scorn upon the dew That fell in its first warm hour, 'T is the flame that curls round the martyr's head, Whose task is to destroy; 'T is the lamp on the altars of the dead, Whose light is not of joy! Then crush, even in their hour of birth, The infant buds of Love, And tread his growing fire to earth, Ere 't is dark in clouds above; Cherish no more a cypress tree To shade thy future years, Nor nurse a heart-flame that may be Quench'd only with thy tears. CONNECTICUT. FROM AN UNPUBLISHED POEM. And still her gray rocks tower above the sea That murmurs at their feet, a conquer'd wave; 'T is a rough land of earth, and stone, and tree, Where breathes no castled lord or cabined slave; Where thoughts, and tongues, and hands, are bold and free, And friends will find a welcome, foes a grave; And where none kneel, save when to heaven they pray, Nor even then, unless in their own way. Theirs is a pure republic, wild, yet strong, A “fierce democracie,” where all are true To what themselves have voted—right or wrong— And to their laws denominated blue; (If red, they might to Draco's code belong;) A vestal state, which power could not subdue, Nor promise win—like her own eagle's nest, Sacred—the San Marino of the west. A justice of the peace, for the time being, They bow to, but may turn him out next year; They reverence their priest, but disagreeing In price or creed, dismiss him without fear; They have a natural talent for foreseeing And knowing all things;—and should Park appear From his long tour in Africa, to show The Niger's source, they'd meet him with—“we know.” They love their land, because it is their own, And scorn to give aught other reason why; Would shake hands with a king upon his throne, And think it kindness to his majesty; A stubborn race, fearing and flattering none. Such are they nurtured, such they live and die: All—but a few apostates, who are meddling With merchandise, pounds, shillings, pence, and peddling; Or wandering through southern countries, teaching The A. B. C. from Webster's spelling-book; Gallant and godly, making love and preaching, And gaining, by what they call “hook and crook,” And what the moralists call overreaching, A decent living. The Virginians look Upon them with as favorable eyes As Gabriel on the devil in paradise. But these are but their outcasts. View them near At home, where all their worth and pride is placed; And there their hospitable fires burn clear, And there the lowliest farm-house hearth is graced With manly hearts, in piety sincere, Faithful in love, in honor stern and chaste, In friendship warm and true, in danger brave, Beloved in life, and sainted in the grave. And minds have there been nurtured, whose control Is felt even in their nation's destiny; Men who swayed senates with a statesman's soul, And look'd on armies with a leader's eye; Names that adorn and dignify the scroll, Whose leaves contain their country's history, And tales of love and war—listen to one, Of the Green-Mountaineer—the Stark of Bennington. When on that field his band the Hessians fought, Briefly he spoke before the fight began— “Soldiers! those German gentlemen are bought For four pounds eight and seven pence per man, By England's king—a bargain, as is thought. Are we worth more? Let 's prove it now we can— For we must beat them, boys, ere set of sun, Or Mary Stark 's a widow.”—It was done. Hers are not Tempe's nor Arcadia's spring, Nor the long summer of Cathayan vales, The vines, the flowers, the air, the skies, that fling Such wild enchantment o'er Boccaccio's tales Of Florence and the Arno—yet the wing Of life's best angel, Health, is on her gales Through sun and snow—and in the autumn time Earth has no purer and no lovelier clime. Her clear, warm heaven at noon,—the mist that shrouds Her twilight hills,—her cool and starry eves, The glorious splendor of her sunset clouds, The rainbow beauty of her forest leaves, Come o'er the eye, in solitude and crowds, Where'er his web of song her poet weaves; And his mind's brightest vision but displays The autumn scenery of his boyhood's days. And when you dream of woman, and her love; Her truth, her tenderness, her gentle power; The maiden, listening in the moonlight grove, The mother smiling in her infant's bower; Forms, features, worshipp'd while we breathe or move, Be by some spirit of your dreaming hour Borne, like Loretto's chapel, through the air To the green land I sing, then wake, you'll find them there. TWILIGHT. There is an evening twilight of the heart, When its wild passion waves are lull'd to rest, And the eye sees life's fairy scenes depart, As fades the day-beam in the rosy west. 'T is with a nameless feeling of regret We gaze upon them as they melt away, And fondly would we bid them linger yet, But Hope is round us with her angel lay, Hailing afar some happier moonlight hour; Dear are her whispers still, though lost their early power. In youth the cheek was crimson'd with her glow; Her smile was loveliest then; her matin song Was heaven's own music, and the note of wo Was all unheard her sunny bowers among. Life's little world of bliss was newly born; We knew not, cared not, it was born to die. Flush'd with the cool breeze and the dews of morn, With dancing heart we gazed on the pure sky, And mock'd the passing clouds that dimm'd its blue, Like our own sorrows then—as fleeting and as few. And manhood felt her sway too,—on the eye, Half realized, her early dreams burst bright, Her promised bower of happiness seem'd nigh, Its days of joy, its vigils of delight; And though at times might lower the thunder storm, And the red lightnings threaten, still the air Was balmy with her breath, and her loved form, The rainbow of the heart, was hovering there. 'T is in life's noontide she is nearest seen, Her wreath the summer flower, her robe of summer green. But though less dazzling in her twilight dress, There's more of heaven's pure beam about her now; That angel-smile of tranquil loveliness, Which the heart worships, glowing on her brow; That smile shall brighten the dim evening star That points our destined tomb, nor e'er depart Till the faint light of life is fled afar, And hush'd the last deep beating of the heart; The meteor-bearer of our parting breath, A moon-beam in the midnight cloud of death. WEEHAWKEN. Weehawken! In thy mountain scenery yet, All we adore of nature, in her wild And frolic hour of infancy, is met; And never has a summer's morning smiled Upon a lovelier scene, than the full eye Of the enthusiast revels on—when high, Amid thy forest solitudes, he climbs O'er crags, that proudly tower above the deep, And knows that sense of danger, which sublimes The breathless moment—when his daring step Is on the verge of the cliff, and he can hear The low dash of the wave with startled ear, Like the death music of his coming doom, And clings to the green turf with desperate force, As the heart clings to life; and when resume The currents in his veins their wonted course, There lingers a deep feeling—like the moan Of wearied ocean, when the storm is gone. In such an hour he turns, and on his view, Ocean, and earth, and heaven, burst before him Clouds slumbering at his feet, and the clear blue Of summer's sky, in beauty bending o'er him— The city bright below; and far away Sparkling in golden light, his own romantic bay. Tall spire, and glittering roof, and battlement, And banners floating in the sunny air; And white sails o'er the calm blue waters bent, Green isle, and circling shore, are blended there, In wild reality. When life is old, And many a scene forgot, the heart will hold Its memory of this; nor lives there one Whose infant breath was drawn, or boyhood days Of happiness, were pass'd beneath that sun, That in his manhood prime can calmy gaze Upon that bay, or on that mountain stand, Nor feel the prouder of his native land. JOSEPH HUTTON THE FIELD OF ORLEANS. Farewell, awhile, domestic charms, My home and country urge to arms, 'Mid danger's ranks, and war's alarms, Which stern invaders spread; And if, perchance, a fatal bourne Forbid the soldier's safe return, A nation's gratitude shall mourn, And honor crown, the dead! Farewell the gathering of the year; Release the share and grasp the spear; Droop their full ears the swelling grain, The verdant grass, the luscious cane; The harvest of another soil Demands each nerve in manly toil; Where blood alone may compost yield, And brand and bayonet reap the field. Delight not me the meed of fame, The fleeting breath of proud acclaim, Or warrior's wreath, or valiant name,— Far other joys are mine; I court not battle's awful brunt, Nor honors, in the dareful front; But, my dear country, call'st thou aid, Behold, I grasp the freeman's blade, And be my service thine! And nearer now the foemen drew, They press thy borders, Bienvenu, Stern as the angry winds that blew Across thy startled bed! And dark and dismal was the night, When first they struck the deep'ning fight; Save when anon, a mournful star, Streamed feebly from its sphere afar: The troops a cloud—their weapons steel'd, The brightest star-light of the field, A fearful vision spread! Silent they moved along the lake, No war sound bids the slumb'ring wake, Nor dashing oars the waters break, To rouse th' unconscious state; But from her hills of living green, Columbia's guardian maid had seen, She roused at once to intervene, And save her sons from fate! Who, rising o'er the watery bed, To taint the soil with hostile tread, The margin bold now climbs? A warrior stern, who sterner band, To conquest oft, in Spanish land, Had led in former times! Long shall Iberia feel the aid She gather'd from his biting blade, When, urged by bold Napoleon, Invading France came madly on. And mingling now the conflict, rang Helmet and spear, the battle clang. But wherefore, warrior, art thou here, Feels thy bold heart no touch of fear, When freemen seize the guardian spear, Their country to defend? Nought may thy former deeds avail, No more thy hope shall conquest hail, The laurels of thy brow grow pale, Prophetic of thy end! That time, full many a widowed dame, And orphan, shall with anguish name, And grief the burning tear drop claim, Of every hope deprived! Whose breast stern war's resistless aim, With misery hath rived! And mark the Caledonian maid, Of glowing cheek, of auburn braid, Blue Cheviot's sloping height above, She rolls her soft blue eyes of love Along the western sky-bound wave, Anxious to view the bark so brave, That bears her soldier home; But, ah! the unrelenting glaive, Has sent him to an early grave, No tender friend to soothe or save From carnage and the tomb! On Mississippi's side he fell, Whose rapids roared his dying knell! Glassy and dim that manly eye, Which lighted love and ecstacy; Once flamed with hope of proud renown, And looked the fear of danger down! The last thought of his throbbing breast, Turned to the maid he erst had press'd, When with fond hope supremely bless'd, No fields of conflict known: But Hope, thou art a baseless dream, That wak'st to life thy mimic theme; For mark the change!—the big tears trace Their passage down his pallid face, He heaves the parting groan! Stern War! what fateful deeds are thine, With dripping blood thy garments shine, And Ruin, Rage, with thee combine, Whose eyes wild terrors flash! The Horrors form thy dreadful train, And Cruelty conducts thy wain, Of bleeding sinews is the rein, Of clotted braids each courser's mane, Of scorpion fangs the lash! The wheels thy thirsty fury draws O'er all divine and human laws; Dashing through each devoted realm Those waves which roll but to o'erwhelm; And like the flood which whilom rose, Sweep from the world whate'er oppose! Such is thy worth, disastrous war, And such thy ruins, hurl'd afar, That, when the glorious day may be, For fate to strike his spear through thee, Thy eulogy's thy victim's groans, Thy monument their bleaching bones! CHARLES SPRAGUE PROLOGUE, ON THE OPENING OF THE NEW YORK THEATRE, SEPTEMBER 1, 1821. When mitred Zeal, in wild, unholy days, Bared his red arm, and bade the fagot blaze, Our patriot sires the pilgrim sail unfurl'd, And Freedom pointed to a rival world. Where prowl'd the wolf, and where the hunter roved, Faith raised her altars to the God she loved; Toil, link'd with Art, explored each savage wild, The lofty forest bow'd, the desert smiled; The startled Indian o'er the mountains flew, The wigwam vanish'd, and the village grew; Taste rear'd her domes, fair Science spread her page, And Wit and Genius gather'd round the stage! The Stage!—where Fancy sits, creative queen, And waves her sceptre o'er life's mimic scene; Where young-eyed Wonder comes to feast his sight, And quaff instruction while he drinks delight.— The Stage!—that threads each labyrinth of the soul, Wakes laughter's peal, and bids the tear-drop roll; That hoots at folly, mocks proud fashion's slave, Uncloaks the hypocrite, and brands the knave. The child of Genius, catering for the Stage, Rifles the wealth of every clime and age. He speaks! the sepulchre resigns its prey, And crimson life runs through the sleeping clay. The wave, the gibbet, and the battle field, At his command, their festering tenants yield. Pale, bleeding Love comes weeping from the tomb, That kindred softness may bewail her doom; Murder's dry bones, reclothed, desert the dust, That after times may own his sentence just; Forgotten Wisdom, freed from death's embrace, Reads awful lessons to another race; And the mad tyrant of some ancient shore, Here warns a world that he can curse no more. May this fair Dome, in classic beauty rear'd, By Worth be honor'd, and by Vice be fear'd. May chasten'd Wit here bend to Virtue's cause, Reflect her image, and repeat her laws; And Guilt, that slumbers o'er the sacred page, Hate his own likeness, shadow'd from the Stage. Here let the Guardian of the Drama sit, In righteous judgment o'er the realms of wit. Not his the shame, with servile pen to wait On private friendship, or on private hate; To flatter fools, or Satire's javelin dart, Tipp'd with a lie, at proud Ambition's heart; His be the nobler task to herald forth Young, blushing Merit, and neglected Worth; To brand the page where goodness finds a sneer, And lash the wretch that breathes the treason here. Here shall bright Genius wing his eagle flight, Rich dew-drops shaking from his plumes of light, Till, high in mental worlds, from vulgar ken He soars, the wonder and the pride of men. Cold Censure here to decent Mirth shall bow, And Bigotry unbend his monkish brow; Here Toil shall pause, his ponderous sledge thrown by, And Beauty bless each strain with melting eye. Grief, too, in fiction lost, shall cease to weep, And all the world's rude cares be laid to sleep. Each polish'd scene shall Taste and Truth approve, And the Stage triumph in the people's love. PROLOGUE ON THE OPENING OF THE NEW PHILADELPHIA THEATRE, DECEMBER 1, 1822. When learning slumber'd in the convent's shade, And holy craft the groping nations sway'd, By dulness banned, the Muses wander'd long, Each lyre neglected, and forgot each song; Till Heaven's bright halo wreathed the Drama's dome, And great Apollo call'd the pilgrims home. Then their glad harps, that charm'd old Greece, they swept, Their altars throng'd, and joy's high sabbath kept. Young Genius there his glorious banners rear'd, To float forever loved, forever fear'd. The cowl's device, the cloister's legend known, Old Superstition tumbled from his throne; Back to his cell the king of gloom retired, The buskin triumph'd, and the world admired! Since that proud hour, through each unfetter'd age, The sons of light have cluster'd round the stage. From Fiction's realms her richest spoils they bring, And Pleasure's walls with Rapture's echoes ring. Here hermit Wisdom lays his mantle down, To win with smiles the heart that fears his frown; In mirth's gay robe he talks to wondering youth, And Grandeur listens to the voice of Truth. Beauty, with bounding heart and tingling ear, Melts at the tale to love and feeling dear; Their sacred bowers the sons of learning quit, To rove with fancy, and to feast with wit; All come to gaze, the valiant and the vain, Virtue's bright troop, and Fashion's glittering train. Here Labor rests, pale Grief forgets her wo, And Vice, whose mildew breath taints all below, Even Vice looks on!—For this the Stage was rear'd, To scourge the fiend, so cherish'd, scorn'd and fear'd Not tied alone to poverty's cold walls, He dwells with pomp, treads plenty's marble halls; Proudly he sits where senate-sages meet, Gravely he dooms in judgment's awful seat; God's lovely temple shall behold him there, With eye upturn'd, and aspect false as fair; Even at the altar's very horns he stands, And breaks and blesses with polluted hands. Then hither let the unblushing villain roam, Satire shall knot its whip and strike it home. The stage one groan from his dark soul shall draw, That mocks religion, and that laughs at law! To grace the stage, the bard's careering mind Seeks other worlds, and leaves his own behind: He lures from air its bright, unprison'd forms, Breaks through the tomb, and death's dull region storms. O'er ruin'd realms he pours creative day, And slumbering kings his mighty voice obey. From its damp shroud the long-laid spirit walks, And round the murderer's bed in vengeance stalks. Poor maniac beauty brings her cypress wreath, Her smile a moon-beam o'er a blasted heath; Round some cold grave she comes, sweet flowers to strew, And lost to reason, still to love is true. Hate shuts his soul when dove-eyed Mercy pleads, Power lifts the axe, and Truth's bold servant bleeds; Remorse drops anguish from his burning eyes, Feels hell's eternal worm, and, shuddering, dies. War's trophied minion, too, forsakes the dust, Grasps his worn shield, and waves his sword of rust, Springs to the slaughter at the trumpet's call, Again to conquer, or again to fall. With heads to censure, yet with souls to feel, Friends of the Stage! receive our frank appeal. No suppliant lay we frame; acquit your trust; The Drama guard; be gentle, but be just! Within her courts, unbribed, unslumbering, stand, Scourge lawless Wit, and leaden Dulness brand; Lash pert Pretence, but bashful Merit spare, His firstlings hail, and speak the trembler fair; Yet shall he cast his cloud, and proudly claim The loftiest station and the brightest fame. So from his perch, through seas of golden light, Our mountain eagle takes his glorious flight; To heaven the monarch bird exulting springs, And shakes the night-fog from his mighty wings. Bards all our own shall yet enchant their age, And pour redeeming splendor o'er the Stage. For them, for you, Truth hoards a nobler theme, Than ever bless'd young Fancy's sweetest dream. Bold hearts shall kindle, and bright eyes shall gaze, When genius wakes the tale of other days, Sheds life's own lustre o'er each holy deed Of Him who planted, and of Him who freed! And now, Fair Pile, thou chaste and glorious shrine, Our fondest wish, our warmest smile be thine; The home of genius and the court of taste, In beauty raised, be thou by beauty graced. Within thy walls may Wit's adorers throng, To drink the magic of the poet's song: Within thy walls may youth and goodness draw From every scene a lecture or a law. So bright the fane, be priest and offering pure, And friends shall bless, and bigot foes endure: Long, long be spared to echo truths sublime, And lift thy pillars through the storms of time. SHAKSPEARE ODE. God of the glorious Lyre! Whose notes of old on lofty Pindus rang, While Jove's exulting quire Caught the glad echoes and responsive sang— Come! bless the service and the shrine, We consecrate to thee and thine. Fierce from the frozen north, When havoc led his legions forth, O'er Learning's sunny groves the dark destroyer spread: In dust the sacred statue slept, Fair Science round her altars wept, And Wisdom cowl'd his head. At length, Olympian Lord of morn, The raven veil of night was torn, When, through golden clouds descending, Thou didst hold thy radiant flight, O'er nature's lovely pageant bending, Till Avon roll'd, all-sparkling, to thy sight! There, on its bank, beneath the Mulberry's shade, Wrapp'd in young dreams, a wild-eyed Minstrel stray'd. Lighting there and lingering long, Thou didst teach the Bard his song; Thy fingers strung his sleeping shell, And round his brows a garland curl'd; On his lips thy spirit fell, And bade him wake and warm the world! Then Shakspeare rose! Across the trembling strings His daring hand he flings, And lo! a new creation glows! There, clustering round, submissive to his will, Fate's vassal train his high commands fulfil. Madness, with his frightful scream, Vengeance, leaning on his lance, Avarice, with his blade and beam, Hatred, blasting with a glance; Remorse, that weeps, and Rage, that roars, And Jealousy, that dotes, but dooms, and murders, yet adores. Mirth, his face with sunbeams lit, Waking laughter's merry swell, Arm in arm with fresh-eyed Wit, That waves his tingling lash, while Folly shakes his bell. Despair, that haunts the gurgling stream, Kiss'd by the virgin moon's cold beam, Where some lost maid wild chaplets wreathes, And, swan-like, there her own dirge breathes, Then, broken-hearted, sinks to rest, Beneath the bubbling wave, that shrouds her maniac breast. Young Love, with eye of tender gloom, Now drooping o'er the hallow'd tomb, Where his plighted victims lie, Where they met, but met to die: And now, when crimson buds are sleeping, Through the dewy arbor peeping, Where beauty's child, the frowning world forgot, To youth's devoted tale is listening, Rapture on her dark lash glistening, While fairies leave their cowslip cells and guard the happy spot. Thus rise the phantom throng, Obedient to their Master's song, And lead in willing chain the wondering soul along. For other worlds war's Great One sigh'd in vain,— O'er other worlds see Shakspeare rove and reign! The rapt Magician of his own wild lay, Earth and her tribes his mystic wand obey. Old ocean trembles, thunder cracks the skies, Air teems with shapes, and tell-tale spectres rise: Night's paltering hags their fearful orgies keep, And faithless guilt unseals the lip of sleep: Time yields his trophies up, and death restores The moulder'd victims of his voiceless shores. The fireside legend, and the faded page, The crime that cursed, the deed that bless'd an age, All, all come forth—the good to charm and cheer, To scourge bold Vice, and start the generous tear; With pictured Folly gazing fools to shame, And guide young Glory's foot along the path of fame. Lo! hand in hand, Hell's juggling sisters stand, To greet their victim from the fight;— Group'd on the blasted heath, They tempt him to the work of death, Then melt in air and mock his wondering sight. In midnight's hallow'd hour, He seeks the fatal tower, Where the lone raven, perch'd on high, Pours to the sullen gale Her hoarse prophetic wail, And croaks the dreadful moment nigh. See, by the phantom dagger led, Pale, guilty thing, Slowly he steals with silent tread, And grasps his coward steel to smite his sleeping king. Hark! 't is the signal bell, Struck by that bold and unsex'd one, Whose milk is gall, whose heart is stone; His ear hath caught the knell— 'T is done! 't is done! Behold him from the chamber rushing, Where his dead monarch's blood is gushing! Look where he trembling stands, Sad gazing there, Life's smoking crimson on his hands, And in his felon heart the worm of wild despair. Mark the sceptred traitor slumbering! There flit the slaves of conscience round, With boding tongue foul murders numbering; Sleep's leaden portals catch the sound. In his dream of blood for mercy quaking, At his own dull scream behold him waking! Soon that dream to fate shall turn, For him the living furies burn; For him the vulture sits on yonder misty peak, And chides the lagging night, and whets her hungry beak. Hark! the trumpet's warning breath Echoes round the vale of death. Unhorsed, unhelmed, disdaining shield, The panting tyrant scours the field. Vengeance! he meets thy dooming blade! The scourge of earth, the scorn of heaven, He falls! unwept and unforgiven, And all his guilty glories fade. Like a crush'd reptile in the dust he lies, And Hate's last lightning quivers from his eyes! Behold yon crownless king— Yon white-lock'd, weeping sire:— Where heaven's unpillar'd chambers ring, And burst their streams of flood and fire! He gave them all—the daughters of his love;— That recreant pair!—they drive him forth to rove; In such a night of wo, The cubless regent of the wood Forgets to bathe her fangs in blood, And caverns with her foe! Yet one was ever kind,— Why lingers she behind? O pity!—view him by her dead form kneeling, Even in wild frenzy holy nature feeling. His aching eyeballs strain To see those curtain'd orbs unfold, That beauteous bosom heave again,— But all is dark and cold. In agony the father shakes; Grief's choking note Swells in his throat, Each wither'd heart-string tugs and breaks! Round her pale neck his dying arms he wreathes, And on her marble lips his last, his death-kiss breathes. Down! trembling wing—shall insect weakness keep The sun-defying eagle's sweep? A mortal strike celestial strings, And feebly echo what a seraph sings? Who now shall grace the glowing throne, Where, all unrivall'd, all alone, Bold Shakspeare sat, and look'd creation through, The Minstrel Monarch of the worlds he drew? That throne is cold—that lyre in death unstrung, On whose proud note delighted Wonder hung. Yet old Oblivion, as in wrath he sweeps, One spot shall spare—the grave where Shakspeare sleeps. Rulers and ruled in common gloom may lie, But Nature's laureate bards shall never die. Art's chisell'd boast, and Glory's trophied shore, Must live in numbers, or can live no more. While sculptured Jove some nameless waste may claim, Still rolls th' Olympic car in Pindar's fame: Troy's doubtful walls, in ashes past away, Yet frown on Greece in Homer's deathless lay: Rome, slowly sinking in her crumbling fanes, Stands all immortal in her Maro's strains:— So, too, yon giant empress of the isles, On whose broad sway the sun for ever smiles, To Time's unsparing rage one day must bend, And all her triumphs in her Shakspeare end! O Thou! to whose creative power We dedicate the festal hour, While Grace and Goodness round the altar stand, Learning's anointed train, and Beauty's rose-lipp'd band— Realms yet unborn, in accents now unknown, Thy song shall learn, and bless it for their own. Deep in the West, as Independence roves, His banners planting round the land he loves, Where nature sleeps in Eden's infant grace, In time's full hour shall spring a glorious race:— Thy name, thy verse, thy language shall they bear, And deck for thee the vaulted temple there. Our Roman-hearted fathers broke Thy parent empire's galling yoke, But thou, harmonious ruler of the mind, Around their sons a gentler chain shalt bind;— In thee shall Albion's sceptre wave once more, And what her monarch lost her monarch-bard restore. TO MY CIGAR. Yes, social friend, I love thee well, In learned doctors' spite; I love thy fragrant, misty spell, I love thy calm delight. What though they tell, with phizzes long, My years are sooner past; I would reply, with reason strong, They 're sweeter while they last. And oft, mild friend, to me thou art A monitor, though still; Thou speak'st a lesson to my heart, Beyond the preacher's skill. Thou 'rt like the man of worth, who gives To goodness every day, The odor of whose virtues lives, When he has pass'd away. When in the lonely evening hour, Attended but by thee, O'er history's varied page I pore, Man's fate in thine I see. Oft as thy snowy column grows, Then breaks and falls away, I trace how mighty realms thus rose, Thus tumbled to decay. Awhile like thee earth's masters burn, And smoke and fume around, And then like thee to ashes turn, And mingle with the ground. Life 's but a leaf adroitly roll'd, And time 's the wasting breath, That late or early, we behold, Gives all to dusty death. From beggar's frieze to monarch's robe, One common doom is pass'd, Sweet nature's works, the swelling globe, Must all burn out at last. And what is he who smokes thee now?— A little moving heap, That soon like thee to fate must bow, With thee in dust must sleep. But though thy ashes downward go, Thy essence rolls on high; Thus when my body must lie low, My soul shall cleave the sky. THE WINGED WORSHIPPERS. Two swallows, having glown into church during divine service, were apostrophized in the following stanzas. Gay, guiltless pair, What seek ye from the fields of heaven? Ye have no need of prayer, Ye have no sins to be forgiven. Why perch ye here, Where mortals to their Maker bend? Can your pure spirits fear The God ye never could offend? Ye never knew The crimes for which we come to weep: Penance is not for you, Bless'd wanderers of the upper deep. To you 't is given To wake sweet nature's untaught lays; Beneath the arch of heaven To chirp away a life of praise. Then spread each wing, Far, far above, o'er lakes and lands, And join the choirs that sing In yon blue dome not rear'd with hands. Or if ye stay, To note the consecrated hour, Teach me the airy way, And let me try your envied power. Above the crowd, On upward wings could I but fly, I'd bathe in you bright cloud, And seek the stars that gem the sky 'T were heaven indeed, Through fields of trackless light to soar, On nature's charms to feed, And nature's own great God adore. ART. When from the sacred garden driven, Man fled before his Maker's wrath, An angel left her place in heaven, And cross'd the wanderer's sunless path. 'T was Art! sweet Art! new radiance broke, Where her light foot flew o'er the ground; And thus with seraph voice she spoke, “The curse a blessing shall be found.” She led him through the trackless wild, Where noontide sunbeam never blazed:— The thistle shrunk—the harvest smiled, And nature gladden'd as she gazed. Earth's thousand tribes of living things, At Art's command to him are given, The village grows, the city springs, And point their spires of faith to heaven. He rends the oak—and bids it ride, To guard the shores its beauty graced; He smites the rock—upheaved in pride, See towers of strength, and domes of taste. Earth's teeming caves their wealth reveal, Fire bears his banner on the wave, He bids the mortal poison heal, And leaps triumphant o'er the grave. He plucks the pearls that stud the deep, Admiring Beauty's lap to fill: He breaks the stubborn marble's sleep, And mocks his own Creator's skill. With thoughts that swell his glowing soul, He bids the ore illume the page, And proudly scorning time's control, Commerces with an unborn age. In fields of air he writes his name, And treads the chambers of the sky; He reads the stars, and grasps the flame, That quivers round the Throne on high. In war renown'd, in peace sublime, He moves in greatness and in grace; His power subduing space and time, Links realm to realm, and race to race. JOHN GARDINER CALKINS BRAINARD. THE FALL OF NIAGARA. The thoughts are strange that crowd into my brain, While I look upward to thee. It would seem As if God pour'd thee from his “hollow hand,” And hung his bow upon thine awful front; And spoke in that loud voice, which seem'd to him Who dwelt in Patmos for his Saviour's sake, “The sound of many waters;” and had bade Thy flood to chronicle the ages back, And notch His cent'ries in the eternal rocks. Deep calleth unto deep. And what are we, That hear the question of that voice sublime? Oh! what are all the notes that ever rung From war's vain trumpet, by thy thundering side! Yea, what is all the riot man can make In his short life, to thy unceasing roar! And yet, bold babbler, what art thou to Him, Who drown'd a world, and heap'd the waters far Above its loftiest mountains?—a light wave, That breaks, and whispers of its Maker's might. EPITHALAMIUM. I saw two clouds at morning, Tinged with the rising sun; And in the dawn they floated on, And mingled into one: I thought that morning cloud was blest, It moved so sweetly to the west. I saw two summer currents, Flow smoothly to their meeting, And join their course, with silent force, In peace each other greeting: Calm was their course through banks of green, While dimpling eddies play'd between. Such be your gentle motion, Till life's last pulse shall beat; Like summer's beam, and summer's stream, Float on, in joy, to meet A calmer sea, where storms shall cease— A purer sky, where all is peace. ON A LATE LOSS. The loss of Professor Fisher of Yale College, in the Albion. The breath of air that stirs the harp's soft string, Floats on to join the whirlwind and the storm; The drops of dew exhaled from flowers of spring, Rise and assume the tempest's threatening form; The first mild beam of morning's glorious sun, Ere night, is sporting in the lightning's flash; And the smooth stream, that flows in quiet on, Moves but to aid the overwhelming dash That wave and wind can muster, when the might Of earth, and air, and sea, and sky unite. So science whisper'd in thy charmed ear, And radiant learning beckon'd thee away. The breeze was music to thee, and the clear Beam of thy morning promised a bright day. And they have wreck'd thee!—But there is a shore Where storms are hush'd, where tempests never rage; Where angry skies and blackening seas, no more With gusty strength their roaring warfare wage. By thee its peaceful margent shall be trod— Thy home is Heaven, and thy friend is God. COLONIZATION SOCIETY. All sights are fair to the recover'd blind— All sounds are music to the deaf restored— The lame, made whole, leaps like the sporting hind; And the sad bow'd down sinner, with his load Of shame and sorrow, when he cuts the cord, And drops the pack it bound, is free again In the light yoke and burden of his Lord. Thus, with the birthright of his fellow man, Sees, hears and feels at once the righted African. 'T is somewhat like the burst from death to life; From the grave's cerements to the robes of Heaven; From sin's dominion, and from passion's strife, To the pure freedom of a soul forgiven! When all the bonds of death and hell are riven, And mortals put on immortality; When fear, and care, and grief away are driven, And Mercy's hand has turn'd the golden key, And Mercy's voice has said, “Rejoice—thy soul is free!” THE CAPTAIN. A FRAGMENT. The Bridgeport paper of March, 1823, said; “Arrived, schooner Fame, from Charleston, via New London. While at anchor in that harbor, during the rain storm on Thursday evening last, the Fame was run foul of by the wreck of the Methodist Meeting-House from Norwich, which was carried away in the late freshet.” Solemn he paced upon that schooner's deck, And mutter'd of his hardships:—“I have been Where the wild will of Mississippi's tide Has dash'd me on the sawyer;—I have sail'd In the thick night, along the wave-wash'd edge Of ice, in acres, by the pitiless coast Of Labrador; and I have scraped my keel O'er coral rocks in Madagascar seas— And often in my cold and midnight watch, Have heard the warning voice of the lee shore Speaking in breakers! Ay, and I have seen The whale and sword-fish fight beneath my bows; And when they made the deep boil like a pot, Have swung into its vortex; and I know To cord my vessel with a sailor's skill, And brave such dangers with a sailor's heart; —But never yet upon the stormy wave, Or where the river mixes with the main, Or in the chafing anchorage of the bay, In all my rough experience of harm, Met I—a Methodist meeting-house! Cat-head, or beam, or davit has it none, Starboard nor larboard, gunwale, stem nor stern! It comes in such a “questionable shape,” I cannot even speak it! Up jib, Josey, And make for Bridgeport! There, where Stratford Point, Long Beach, Fairweather Island, and the buoy, Are safe from such encounters, we'll protest! And Yankee legends long shall tell the tale, That once a Charleston schooner was beset, Riding at anchor, by a Meeting-House. THE DEEP. There's beauty in the deep:— The wave is bluer than the sky; And though the light shine bright on high, More softly do the sea-gems glow That sparkle in the depths below; The rainbow's tints are only made When on the waters they are laid, And Sun and Moon most sweetly shine Upon the ocean's level brine. There 's beauty in the deep. There 's music in the deep:— It not in the surf's rough roar, Nor in the whispering, shelly shore— They are but earthly sounds, that tell How little of the sea-nymph's shell, That sends its loud, clear note abroad, Or winds its softness through the flood, Echoes through groves with coral gay, And dies, on spongy banks, away. There 's music in the deep. There 's quiet in the deep:— Above, let tides and tempests rave, And earth-born whirlwinds wake the wave; Above, let care and fear contend, With sin and sorrow to the end: Here, far beneath the tainted foam, That frets above our peaceful home, We dream in joy, and wake in love, Nor know the rage that yells above. There 's quiet in the deep. THE INDIAN SUMMER. What is there saddening in the Autumn leaves? Have they that “green and yellow melancholy” That the sweet poet spake of?—Had he seen Our variegated woods, when first the frost Turns into beauty all October's charms— When the dread fever quits us—when the storms Of the wild Equinox, with all its wet, Has left the land, as the first deluge left it, With a bright bow of many colors hung Upon the forest tops—he had not sigh'd. The moon stays longest for the Hunter now: The trees cast down their fruitage, and the blithe And busy squirrel hoards his winter store: While man enjoys the breeze that sweeps along The bright blue sky above him, and that bends Magnificently all the forest's pride, Or whispers through the evergreens, and asks, “What is there saddening in the Autumn leaves?” THE TWO COMETS. There once dwelt in Olympus some notable oddities, For their wild singularities call'd Gods and Goddesses.— But one in particular beat 'em all hollow, Whose name, style and title was Phœbus Apollo. Now Phœb. was a genius—his hand he could turn To anything, everything genius can learn: Bright, sensible, graceful, cute, spirited, handy, Well bred, well behaved—a celestial Dandy! An eloquent god, though he did n't say much; But he drew a long bow, spoke Greek, Latin and Dutch; A doctor, a poet, a soarer, a diver, And of horses in harness an excellent driver. He would tackle his steeds to the wheels of the sun, And he drove up the east every morning, but one; When young Phæton begg'd of his daddy at five, To stay with Aurora a day, and he'd drive. So good natured Phœbus gave Phaey the seat, With his mittens, change, waybill, and stage horn complete; To the breeze of the morning he shook his bright locks, Blew the lamps of the night out, and mounted the box. The crack of his whip, like the breaking of day, Warm'd the wax in the ears of the leaders, and they With a snort, like the fog of the morning, clear'd out For the west, as young Phaey meant to get there about Two hours before sunset. He look'd at his “turnip,” And to make the delay of the old line concern up, He gave 'em the reins; and from Aries to Cancer, The style of his drive on the road seem'd to answer; But at Leo, the ears of the near wheel-horse prick'd, And at Virgo the heels of the off leader kick'd; Over Libra the whiffle-tree broke in the middle, And the traces snapp'd short, like the strings of a fiddle. One wheel struck near Scorpio, who gave it a roll, And sent it to buzz, like a top, round the pole; While the other whizz'd back with its linchpin and hub, Or, more learnedly speaking, its nucleus or nub; And, whether in earnest, or whether in fun, He carried away a few locks of the sun. The state of poor Phaeton's coach was a blue one, And Jupiter order'd Apollo a new one; But our driver felt rather too proud to say “Whoa,” Letting horses, and harness, and everything go At their terrified pleasure abroad; and the muse Says, they cut to this day just what capers they choose; That the eyes of the chargers as meteors shine forth; That their manes stream along in the lights of the north; That the wheels which are missing are comets, that run As fast as they did when they carried the sun; And still pushing forward, though never arriving, Think the west is before them, and Phaeton driving. ADDRESS TO CONNECTICUT RIVER. From that Ione lake, the sweetest of the chain That links the mountain to the mighty main, Fresh from the rock and welling by the tree, Rushing to meet and dare and breast the sea, Fair, noble, glorious, river! in thy wave The sunniest slopes and sweetest pastures lave, The mountain torrent, with its wintry roar Springs from its home and leaps upon thy shore;— The promontories love thee—and for this Turn their rough cheeks and stay thee for thy kiss. Stern, at thy source, thy northern Guardians stand, Rude rulers of the solitary land, Wild dwellers by thy cold sequester'd springs, Of earth the feathers and of air the wings; Their blasts have rock'd thy cradle, and in storm Cover'd thy couch and swathed in snow thy form— Yet, bless'd by all the elements that sweep The clouds above, or the unfathom'd deep, The purest breezes scent thy blooming hills, The gentlest dews drop on thy eddying rills, By the moss'd bank, and by the aged tree, The silver streamlet smoothest glides to thee, The young oak greets thee at the waters' edge, Wet by the wave, though anchor'd in the ledge. —'T is there the otter dives, the beaver feeds, Where pensive osiers dip their willowy weeds, And there the wild-cat purs amid her brood, And trains them, in the sylvan solitude, To watch the squirrel's leap, or mark the mink Paddling the water by thy quiet brink;— Or to out-gaze the grey owl in the dark, Or hear the young fox practising to bark. Dark as the frost-nipp'd leaves that strow'd the ground, The Indian hunter here his shelter found; Here cut his bow and shaped his arrows true, Here built his wigwam and his bark canoe, Spear'd the quick salmon leaping up the fall, And slew the deer without the rifle ball. Here his young squaw her cradling tree would choose, Singing her chant to hush her swart pappoose, Here stain her quills and string her trinkets rude, And weave her warrior's wampum in the wood. —No more shall they thy welcome waters bless, No more their forms thy moonlit banks shall press, No more be heard, from mountain or from grove, His whoop of slaughter, or her song of love. Thou didst not shake, thou didst not shrink, when late The mountain-top shut down its ponderous gate, Tumbling its tree-grown ruins to thy side, And avalanche of acres at a slide. Nor dost thou stay, when winter's coldest breath Howls through the woods and sweeps along the heath— One mighty sigh relieves thy icy breast, And wakes thee from the calmness of thy rest. Down sweeps the torrent ice—it may not stay By rock or bridge, in narrow or in bay— Swift, swifter to the heaving sea it goes And leaves thee dimpling in thy sweet repose. —Yet as the unharm'd swallow skims his way, And lightly drops his pinions in thy spray, So the swift sail shall seek thy inland seas, And swell and whiten in thy purer breeze, New paddles dip thy waters, and strange oars Feather thy waves and touch thy noble shores. Thy noble shores! where the tall steeple shines, At midday, higher than thy mountain pines, Where the white schoolhouse with its daily drill Of sunburnt children, smiles upon the hill, Where the neat village grows upon the eye, Deck'd forth in nature's sweet simplicity— Where hard-won competence, the farmer's wealth, Gains merit honor, and gives labor health, Where Goldsmith's self might send his exiled band To find a new ‘Sweet Auburn’ in our land. What art can execute or taste devise, Decks thy fair course and gladdens in thine eyes— As broader sweep the bendings of thy stream, To meet the southern sun's more constant beam. Here cities rise, and sea-wash'd commerce hails Thy shores and winds, with all her flapping sails, From tropic isles, or from the torrid main— Where grows the grape, or sprouts the sugar-cane— Or from the haunts, where the striped haddock play, By each cold northern bank and frozen bay. Here safe return'd from every stormy sea, Waves the striped flag, the mantle of the free, —That star-lit flag, by all the breezes curl'd Of yon vast deep whose waters grasp the world. In what Arcadian, what Utopian ground Are warmer hearts or manlier feelings found, More hospitable welcome, or more zeal To make the curious ‘tarrying’ stranger feel That, next to home, here best may he abide, To rest and cheer him by the chimney-side; Drink the hale farmer's cider, as he hears From the grey dame the tales of others years. Cracking his shagbarks, as the aged crone, Mixing the true and doubtful into one, Tells how the Indian scalp'd the helpless child And bore its shrieking mother to the wild, Butcher'd the father hastening to his home, Seeking his cottage—finding but his tomb. How drums and flags and troops were seen on high, Wheeling and charging in the northern sky, And that she knew what these wild tokens meant, When to the Old French War her husband went. How, by the thunder-blasted tree, was hid The golden spoils of far famed Robert Kid; And then the chubby grandchild wants to know About the ghosts and witches long ago, That haunted the old swamp. The clock strikes ten— The prayer is said, nor unforgotten then The stranger in their gates. A decent rule Of Elders in thy puritanic school. When the fresh morning wakes him from his dream, And daylight smiles on rock, and slope, and stream, Are there not glossy curls and sunny eyes, As brightly lit and bluer than thy skies, Voices as gentle as an echoed call And sweeter than the soften'd waterfall That smiles and dimples in its whispering spray, Leaping in sportive innocence away:— And lovely forms, as graceful and as gay As wild-brier, budding in an April day —How like the leaves—the fragrant leaves it bears, Their simple purposes and simple cares. Stream of my sleeping fathers! when the sound Of coming war echoed thy hills around, How did thy sons start forth from every glade, Snatching the musket where they left the spade. How did their mothers urge them to the fight, Their sisters tell them to defend the right,— How bravely did they stand, how nobly fall, The earth their coffin and the turf their pall— How did the aged pastor light his eye, When, to his flock, he read the purpose high And stern resolve, whate'er the toil may be, To pledge life, name, fame, all—for Liberty. —Cold is the hand that penn'd that glorious page— Still in the grave the body of that sage Whose lip of eloquence and heart of zeal, Made Patriots act and listening statesmen feel— Brought thy Green Mountains down upon their foes, And thy white summits melted of their snows, While every vale to which his voice could come, Rang with the fife and echoed to the drum. Bold River! better suited are thy waves To nurse the laurels clustering round their graves, Than many a distant stream, that soaks the mud Where thy brave sons have shed their gallant blood, And felt, beyond all other mortal pain, They ne'er should see their happy home again. Thou had'st a poet once,—and he could tell, Most tunefully, whate'er to thee befell, Could fill each pastoral reed upon thy shore— —But we shall hear his classic lays no more! He loved thee, but he took his aged way, By Erie's shore, and Perry's glorious day, To where Detroit looks out amidst the wood, Remote beside the dreary solitude. Yet for his brow thy ivy leaf shall spread, Thy freshest myrtle lift its berried head, And our gnarl'd Charter-oak put forth a bough, Whose leaves shall grace thy Trumbull's honor'd brow. [The dead leaves strow the forest walk] “The dead leaves strow the forest walk, And wither'd are the pale wild-flowers; The frost hangs blackening on the stalk, The dew-drops fall in frozen showers. Gone are the springs green sprouting bowers Gone summer's rich and mantling vines, And Autumn, with her yellow hours, On hill and plain no longer shines. I learn'd a clear and wild-toned note, That rose and swell'd from yonder tree— A gay bird, with too sweet a throat, There perch'd and raised her song for me. The winter comes, and where is she? Away—where summer wings will rove, Where buds are fresh, and every tree Is vocal with the notes of love. Too mild the breath of southern sky, Too fresh the flower that blushes there, The northern breeze that rustles by, Finds leaves too green, and buds too fair; No forest-tree stands stript and bare, No stream beneath the ice is dead, No mountain-top with sleety hair Bends o'er the snows its reverend head. Go there with all the birds,—and seek A happier clime, with livelier flight, Kiss, with the sun, the evening's cheek, And leave me lonely with the night. —I'll gaze upon the cold north light, And mark where all its glories shone— See!—that it all is fair and bright, Feel—that it all is cold and gone.” ROBERT WALN SONG. The bright tear of beauty, in sadness, is stealing,— The gems of the east are less sparkling than these;— Her cheek is all flush'd with the anguish of feeling,— Her white bosom carelessly bared to the breeze. 'T is the bride of the Soldier,—and Fancy had flourish'd In day dreams that circle the phantom of Love, For the visions of bliss that the maiden had nourish'd, Her soul, in the warmth of its tenderness, wove. But hark!—'t is the rush and the roaring of battle That rolls on the lingering wings of the wind; The sabres gleam bright; and the cannon's loud rattle Speaks death to the maiden, left weeping behind. The turf is his pillow;—his mantle is heaven;— The warrior is sleeping the sleep of the brave! The chains of affection are awfully riven, And moulder away in the gloom of the grave. YOU SAID, DEAR GIRL. You said, dear girl, the other night, That love was all a fond illusion!— But why, my dear, with eyes so bright, And cheeks so blooming with confusion? And when I gravely own'd the truth, In prayers that love should ne'er entrance thee. And blamed the wanton dreams of youth,— I saw thee frown;—perhaps 't was fancy. And as I press'd thy burning hand, And breathed the vow of never loving, Why did thy heaving breast expand, With sighs so sweet,—yet so reproving? But when I talk'd of friendship, dear, Of Plato, and his stoic pleasure, I long'd to kiss the starting tear, And steal away the pearly treasure. 'T was love that sparkled in thine eye, And gemm'd thy cheek with wavering flushes 'T was love that breathed the chiding sigh, And mingled its tear with rosy blushes. Then call it friendship;—what you will;— The heart disowns what the lips are naming; It lives in the joy of the holy thrill, And the altar of love is brightly flaming. HUNTING SONG. 'T is the break of day, and cloudless weather, The eager dogs are all roaming together, The moor-cock is flitting across the heather, Up, rouse from your slumbers, Away! No vapor encumbers the day; Wind the echoing horn, For the waking morn Peeps forth in its mantle of gray. The wild-boar is shaking his dewy bristle, The partridge is sounding his morning whistle, The red-deer is bounding o'er the thistle, Up, rouse from your slumbers, Away! No vapor encumbers the day Wind the echoing horn, For the waking morn Peeps forth in its mantle of gray. RUFUS DAWES THE SPIRIT OF BEAUTY. The Spirit of Beauty unfurls her light, And wheels her course in a joyous flight: I know her track through the balmy air, By the blossoms that cluster and whiten there; She leaves the tops of the mountains green, And gems the valley with crystal sheen. At morn, I know where she rested at night, For the roses are gushing with dewy delight; Then she mounts again, and around her flings A shower of light from her purple wings, Till the spirit is drunk with the music on high That silently fills it with ecstacy! At noon she hies to a cool retreat, Where bowering elms over waters meet; She dimples the wave, where the green leaves dip, That smiles, as it curls, like a maiden's lip, When her tremulous bosom would hide, in vain, From her lover, the hope that she loves again. At eve, she hangs o'er the western sky Dark clouds for a glorious canopy; And round the skirts of each sweeping fold, She paints a border of crimson and gold, Where the lingering sunbeams love to stay, When their god in his glory has pass'd away. She hovers around us at twilight hour, When her presence is felt with the deepest power; She mellows the landscape, and crowds the stream With shadows that flit like a fairy dream:— Still wheeling her flight through the gladsome air, The Spirit of Beauty is every where! SUNRISE FROM MOUNT WASHINGTON. The laughing hours have chased away the night, Plucking the stars out from her diadem; And now the blue-eyed morn with modest grace, Looks through her half-drawn curtains in the East Blushing in smiles—and glad as infancy. And see! the foolish Moon, but now so vain Of borrow'd beauty, how she yields her charms, And, pale with envy, steals herself away! The clouds have put their gorgeous livery on, Attendant on the day. The mountain tops Have lit their beacons,—and the vales below Send up a welcoming. No song of birds, Warbling to charm the air with melody, Floats on the frosty breeze; yet Nature hath The very soul of music in her looks,— The sunshine and the shade of poetry! I stand upon thy loftiest pinnacle, Temple of Nature! and look down with awe On the wide world beneath me, dimly seen. Around me crowd the giant sons of earth, Fix'd on their old foundations, unsubdued,— Firm as when first rebellion bade them rise, Unrifted to the Thunderer;—now they seem A family of mountains, clustering round Their hoary patriarch,—emulously watching To meet the partial glances of the day. Far in the glowing East, the flecking light, Mellow'd by distance,—with the blue sky blending,— Questions the eye with ever-varying forms. The sun is up;—away the shadows fling From the broad hills, and hurrying to the west, Sport in the sunshine, till they die away. The many beauteous mountain-streams leap down, Out-welling from the clouds,—and sparkling light Dances along with their perennial flow. And there is beauty in yon river's path— The glad Connecticut. I know her well By the white veil she mantles o'er her charms. At times, she loiters by a ridge of hills, Sportfully hiding; then again with glee Out-rushes from her wild-wood lurking-place. Far as the eye can bound, the ocean-waves And lakes and rivers, mountains, vales and woods, And all that holds the faculty entranced, Bathed in a flood of glory, float in air, And sleep in the deep quietude of joy! There is a fearful stillness in this place— A presence that forbids to break the spell, Till the heart pours its agony in tears. But I must drink the vision while it lasts For even now the curling vapors rise, Wreathing their cloudy coronals to grace These towering summits—bidding me away. But often shall my heart turn back again, Thou glorious eminence!—and when oppress'd And aching with the coldness of the world, Find a sweet resting-place and home with thee. ANNE BULLEN. I weep while gazing on thy modest face Thou pictured history of woman's love, Joy spreads his beaming pinions on thy cheek Shaming its whiteness, and thine eyes are full Of conscious beauty while they undulate. Yet all thy beauty—all thy gentleness Served but to light thy ruin. Is there not Kind heaven! some secret talisman of hearts Whereby to find a resting-place for love? Unhappy maiden! let thy history teach The beautiful and young that when their path Softens with roses, danger may be there; That love may watch the bubbles of the stream, But never trust his image on the wave! RICHARD PENN SMITH THE COTTAGE LOVERS. The mist of the morn is still grey on the mountain; The violet blooms on the brink of the fountain; Low murmurs the stream from the mossy rock gushing, But wildly and loud through the dark ravine rushing. The pheasant now springs from his dew-spangled nest; The crescent moon sinks like a bark in the west; The first streak of morning now breaks through the night, And mountains and vales ring with hymns of delight. The horn of the huntsman sounds far o'er the hill, The voice of the fleet hound is frequent and shrill, While panting the chased stag appears at the lake, He swims the dark stream and then bounds through the brake. How sweet is the woodbine o'er yon lattice creeping, Which blushingly steals where the maiden is sleeping! How softly the breeze sounds that kisses the billow! But softer by far is the sigh on yon pillow. The dash of a light oar is heard on the lake, And gaily a voice sings “Awake! oh! awake! The morning already is gray on the hill; The crow of the barn cock is frequent and shrill. And hark, the wood echoes the wood cutter's stroke; The mocking bird sings on the top of the oak; The cow-boy is driving the herd to the lake, The plough-boy's afield, and all nature's awake. Oh! come, dearest, come, to the cot of thy lover, Where souls may be free as the wings of the plover, And hearts shall be pure as the vestal maid's shrine, And the day star of true love shall never decline. The bright face of one at the lattice is seen, And ruby lips glow through the foliage of green, Like buds of the vine the wild breezes perfuming, Ere breath of the morning has kiss'd them to blooming. The maiden now stands on the brink of the stream, And looks upon life as a fairy-like dream, For she hies to the spot where her soul may be blest With a passion as mild as the dove in its nest. On the stern of the skiff she is seated in haste, Her lover beside her with arm round her waist, He presses her lips as they float from the shore And they mingle their songs with the dash of the oar. FRAGMENT. From a poem entitled Francesca, written before the author was aware that Leigh Hunt had preoccupied the subject. This circumstance induced him to withhold it from publication. Art thou a husband?—hast thou lost The partner of thy joys—thy woes; Didst watch her when in anguish tost, And share the dire conflicting throes Of agonized mortality, Till e'en to thee 't was bliss to close The last fond look of her glazed eye? Art thou a father?—hath thy son, The prop of thy declining life, Fail'd ere his manly race was run, And left thee to a world of strife? Dost thou pursue in cold neglect The remnant of thy journey here; No one thy frailties to protect, Or gray-hair'd sorrows to revere? Is it denied thy stricken heart To gaze upon the face of one, Who seem'd thy former counterpart, Recalling ages long since gone? To see the follies that were thine When life ran frolic through each vein; And thus, e'en in thy life's decline To live the hours of youth again. Art thou a lover?—is the theme Of all thy raptures torn from thee; Hast broke the wild ecstatic dream And woke to actual agony? The eyes where countless cupids play'd; The form as light as gossamer; The neck where thy warm lips have stray'd— Say, does the grave worm fatten there? If so, say, hast thou never known The joy of gazing on the sky While nature sleeps, and you alone Seem roused to thought and misery. Hast never watch'd the pallid moon, While resting on some sifted cloud, Pure as the fretful ocean's foam, And filmy as an angel's shroud. Gazed on her while her crescent pride Seem'd through a sea of pitch to float; Then from the depth of darkness glide, And burst to view a fairy boat; And shed her beams so strong and bright, That the globe seem'd a chrysolite?— 'T is heavenly at that hour to muse, When sleep is o'er the senses stealing, And e'en to agony profuse, Indulge the luxury of feeling. The features to recall of those, Who moulder in their last repose; To chase each image that may rise In mockery before the eyes, Until you catch the happy clue That brings to life the wonted smile, And gives the cheek its roseate hue That moulders in decay the while; Then dead to reason; dead to pain, You dream an hour of bliss again. NORMAN PINNEY. SABBATH MORNING. How calm comes on this holy day! Morning unfolds the eastern sky, And upward takes her lofty way, Triumphant to her throne on high. Earth glorious wakes, as o'er her breast The morning flings her rosy ray, And, blushing from her dreamless rest, Unveils her to the gaze of day; So still the scene, each wakeful sound Seems hallow'd music breathing round. The night-wind to their mountain caves, The morning mists to heaven's blue steep, And to their ocean depths the waves Are gone, their holy rest to keep. 'T is tranquil all—around—above— The forests far, which bound the scene, Are peaceful as their Maker's love, Like hills of everlasting green; And clouds like earthly barriers stand, Or bulwarks of some viewless land. Each tree, that lifts its arms in air, Or hangs its pensive head from high, Seems bending at its morning prayer, Or whispering with the hours gone by. This holy morning, Lord, is thine— Let silence sanctify thy praise, Let heaven and earth in love combine And morning stars their music raise;— For 't is the day—joy—joy—ye dead, When death and hell were captive led. TO ? How calm is Innocence!—Its glow Is resting on that cheek's bright hue, That forehead fair of stainless snow, And that full eye of cloudless blue, Like morning on some sleeping sea, Or hope on dreams of ecstacy. So full and clear its rising beams Through that soft veil of Beauty shine, A pictured soul the vision seems In purity and peace divine; And thoughts sink lovelier there to rest, Like day-beams on the rainbow's breast. Thine is the smile, whose splendors pour O'er all those lineaments their dyes, And tell how deep the boundless store Of treasured joys from whence they rise As the blue tints of ocean show How deep its bosom heaves below. The rays, which palace in the sky, Or gild the glittering gems of night, Are wandering in that clear full eye, Or lingering on that living light, As if from heaven they came to bear Those thoughts like holy treasures there. Yet on those features' purple light, That look of peace, that soul of love, There is a charm far, far more bright, A soft reflection from above, Come down from its own sphere to bless That form with deeper loveliness. Like some celestial dream, its glow, Of heaven is on that sainted air, Soft-mingling with the silent flow Of holy thought, which rises there; 'T is God's own spirit's blessed ray, The dawnings of eternal day. Oh lives there one cold breast can view That wealth of charms, the unconscious light Of that full soul, whose thoughts beam through, And heavenward take their viewless flight, Yet give one wish a fleeting birth On this world's pride, the toys of earth! Thou art to me the loveliest glow, That mantles o'er life's chequered sky, A living spring whose stream shall flow Along the track of years gone by, And with far murmurings deep and clear, Make music still on memory's ear. Farewell—I go to foreign skies, To distant lands, to scenes afar, Yet there, that one dear form shall rise Unfading as the morning star, And smile upon that desert still, The same as on my native hill. SUMNER LINCOLN FAIRFIELD. HOUSEHOLD HOURS. Howe'er the sceptic scoffs, the poet sighs, Hope oft reveals her dimly shadow'd dreams, And seraph joy descends from pale blue skies, And, like sweet sunset on wood-skirted streams, Peace breathes around her stilling harmonies, Her whisper'd music,—while her soft eye beams— And the deep bliss, that crowns the household hearth, From all its woes redeems the bleeding earth. Like woods that shadow the blue mountain sky, The troubled heart still seeks its home in heaven, In those affections which can never die, In hallowed love and human wrongs forgiven! From the fair gardens of the blest on high The fruit of life is yet to lost man given, And 'mid the quiet of his still abode Spirits attend him from the throne of God. The mild deep gentleness, the smile that throws Light from the bosom o'er the high pale brow, And cheek that flushes like the May-morn rose; The all-reposing sympathies, that glow Like violets in the heart, and o'er our woes The silent breathing of their beauty throw— Oh! every deed of daily life doth prove The depth, the strength, the truth of woman's love! When harvest days are pass'd, and autumn skies The giant forests tinge with glorious hues, How o'er the twilight of our thought sweet eyes The fairy beauty of the soul diffuse! The inspiring air like spirit voices sighs 'Mid the close pines and solitary yews, Though the broad leaves on forest boughs look sere, And naked woodlands wail the dying year. Yet the late season brings no hours of gloom, Though thoughtful sadness sighs her evening hymn, For hearth-fires now light up the curtain'd room, And love's wings float amid the twilight dim; Lost loved ones gather round us from the tomb, And blest revealments o'er our spirits swim, And Hopes, that droop'd in trials, soar on high, And link'd affections bear into the sky. Then, side by side, hearts, wedded in their youth, In their meek blessedness expand and glow, And, though the world be faithless, still their truth No pause, no change, no soil of time may know! They hold communion with the world, in sooth, Beyond the stain of sin, the waste of wo, And the deep sanctities of well-spent hours Crown their fair fame with Eden's deathless flowers. Frail as the moth's fair wing is common fame, Brief as the sunlight of an April morn; But love perpetuates the sacred name Devoted to his shrine; in glory born, The boy-god gladly to the lone earth came To vanquish victors and to smile at scorn, And he will rise, when all is finish'd here, The holiest seraph of the highest sphere. As fell the prophet's mantle, in old time, On the meek heir of Israel's sainted sage, Woman! so falls thy unseen power sublime On the lone desert of man's pilgrimage; Thy sweet thoughts breathe, from love's delicious clime, Beauty in youth, and faith in fading age; Through all earth's years of travail, strife and toil, His parch'd affections linger round thy smile. In the young beauty of thy womanhood Thou livest in the being yet to be, Yearning for blessedness ill understood, And known, young mother! only unto thee. Love is her life; and to the wise and good Her heart is heaven—'t is even unto me, Though oft misguided and betrayed and grieved, The only bliss of which I'm not bereaved. Draw near, ye whom my bosom hath enshrined! O Thou! whose life breathes in my heart! and Thou Whose gentle spirit dwelleth in my mind, Whose love, like sunlight, rests upon thy brow! Draw near the hearth! the cold and moaning wind Scatters the ruins of the forest now, But blessings crown us in our own still home— Hail, holy image of the life to come! Hail, ye fair charities! the mellow showers Of the earth's springtime! from your rosy breath The way-worn pilgrim, though the tempest lowers, Breathes a new being in the realm of death, And bears the burden of life's darker hours With cheerlier aspect o'er the lonely heath, That spreads between us and the unfading clime Where true Love triumphs o'er the death of Time. JAMES NACK THE MINSTREL BOY. And am I doom'd to be denied for ever The blessings that to all around are given? And shall those links be reunited never, That bound me to mankind till they were riven In childhood's day? Alas! how soon to sever From social intercourse, the doom of heaven Was pass'd upon me! And the hope how vain, That the decree may be recall'd again. Amid a throng in deep attention bound, To catch the accents that from others fall, The flow of eloquence, the heavenly sound Breathed from the soul of melody, while all Instructed or delighted list around, Vacant unconsciousness must me enthrall! I can but watch each animated face, And there attempt th' inspiring theme to trace. Unheard, unheeded are the lips by me, To others that unfold some heaven-born art, And melody—Oh, dearest melody! How had thine accents thrilling to my heart. Awaken'd all its strings to sympathy, Bidding the spirit at thy magic start! How had my heart responsive to the strain, Throbb'd in love's wild delight or soothing pain In vain—alas, in vain! thy numbers roll— Within my heart no echo they inspire; Though form'd by nature in thy sweet control, To melt with tenderness, or glow with fire, Misfortune closed the portals of the soul; And till an Orpheus rise to sweep the lyre, That can to animation kindle stone, To me thy thrilling power must be unknown. And none are more exquisitely awake To nature's loveliness than those who feel The inspiration of the muse—who take From her the glowing thoughts that as they steal Around the soul entranced, a goddess make Of nature to whose shrine of beauty kneel, The fond enthusiasts adoring all Within her we may dread or lovely call. The terrible in nature is to them The beautiful, and they can with delight Behold the tempest, and its wrath contemn, Stationed upon some rock whose quivering height Is by the spirit swept, whose diadem In burning terror wreathes the brow of night, While the rude winds their cave of slumber rend, And to the loud-voiced thunders answer send. Yet, Nature, not alone when stern and wild Canst thou the homage of the bard awaken, Still art thou worshipp'd by the muse's child, When thou thy throne of terrors hast forsaken; With darkness when thy brow is undefiled, When scarce a leaflet of thy robe is shaken By zephyrs that soft music murmuring, Around thee wave their aromatic wing. When first the queen of night in beauty rides, That with the glory of Apollo vies, One star alone through heaven's azure glides, That when ten thousand thousand robe the skies, Preeminent in beauty still presides; To her the lover's and the poet's eyes Are ever fondly turned to hail the power That smiles such loveliness upon the hour. How often have I watch'd the star of even, When eyes of heaven's own etherial blue, Have follow'd mine to gaze upon the heaven, Where they as on a mirror's face might view The bright and beautiful reflection given, Of their own siarry light and azure hue! But she beholding night's resplendent throne, Of nature's beauty thought, and not her own. I thought of both—if earth appear so fair, How glorious the world beyond the skies; And if the form that heaven-born spirits wear, This earthly shrine so fascinate our eyes, To kneel in worship we can scarce forbear, And e'en to gaze on thine is paradise. O what are those who free from earthly stain, Above yon azure realms in bloom immortal reign? WILLIAM LEGGETT SONG. The tear which thou upbraidest, Thy falsehood taught to flow; The misery which thou madest, My cheek hath blighted so: The charms, alas! that won me, I never can forget, Although thou hast undone me, I own I love thee yet. Go, seek the happier maiden Who lured thy love from me; My heart with sorrow laden Is no more prized by thee: Repeat the vows you made me, Say, swear thy love is true; Thy faithless vows betray'd me, They may betray her too. But no! may she ne'er languish Like me in shame and wo; Ne'er feel the throbbing anguish That I am doom'd to know! The eye that once was beaming A tale of love for thee, Is now with sorrow streaming, For thou art false to me. THE WARRIOR'S RETURN. Still, still is that heart, lovely maid! erst so warm, And pale thy fair cheek, and thy once lovely form Is cold as the marble that bends o'er thy tomb— Thou art gone in the pride of thy youth and thy bloom! There were friends weeping o'er thee, as death dimm'd thine eye; There was one standing by thee who breathed not a sigh: By him not a murmur of sorrow was spoken— But he thought of thy fate with a heart that was broken! His mind as he stood there had travell'd far back Through the vista of years, o'er life's desolate track, To those warm sunny hours when his bosom was young, And when on thy accents delighted he hung. Then he left thee to mourn o'er his absence and pass'd To where flouted war's banner and sounded her blast— And he thought of the battle-field gory and red, The despair of the dying, the blood that was shed: Then a dim dungeon vault next arose on his sight, Where no voice ever entered, no glimmering of light, But in darkness and horror months, years pass'd away, Till he wish'd for that night which endureth for aye! He died not—but after long time was set free; Then how bounded his heart at remembrance of thee! To the maiden he loves with what ardor he's flying! He rushes to meet thee—behold thou art dying! He stood by thy couch as life faded away; With a firm step he walk'd in thy funeral array; No sigh rent his bosom, no tear-drop did start— But what language can picture his anguish of heart! To the battle he hasted, and reckless of life, His war-cry was heard 'mid the wildest of strife: When the conflict was past he was sought for in vain, And he never return'd to his country again. A SONG AT SEA. Our sails are spread before the wind, And onward, onward swift we fly; We 've left our country far behind, No prospect now invites the eye, Save the blue sea, and cloudless sky. Oh! when I waved my last good-bye, To parents, friends, and Mary dear, It was not fear that dimm'd mine eye, This heart ne'er felt a thrill of fear— It was affection caused the tear. And while upon the heaving main Our vessel dashes proudly on, To meet those well-loved friends again, With wealth and honors bravely won, That is the hope I live upon. But should some cannon pointed true, Destroy these soothing dreams of glory, Affection's tears my grave will dew, And Mary, when she hears my story, Will shed love's holiest tribute o'er me. HANNAH F. GOULD THE MERMAID'S SONG. Come, mariner, down in the deep with me, And hide thee under the wave— For I have a bed of coral for thee; And quiet and sound shall thy slumbers be In a cell in the Mermaid's cave. On a pillow of pearls thine eye shall sleep, And nothing disturb thee there; The fishes their silent vigils shall keep— There shall be no grass thy grave to sweep But the silk of the Mermaid's hair. And she who is waiting with cheek so pale, As the tempest and ocean roar; And weeps when she hears the menacing gale, Or sighs to behold her mariner's sail Come whitening up to the shore. She has not long to linger for thee;— Her sorrows shall soon be o'er; For, the cord shall be broke and the prisoner free, Her eye shall close; and her dreams will be So sweet she will wake no more! A FUNERAL PIECE. Lift not, lift not the shadowy pall From the beauteous form it veileth— Nor ask, as the offerings of sorrow fall, Who 't is that the mourner waileth! For, we could not look on a face so dear With the burial gloom surrounding.— A name so cherish'd we must not hear While her funeral bell is sounding. But seek 'mid the throng of the youthful fair Their loveliest still to number!— Ye will find her not, for 't is her we bear In the mansion of death to slumber. She 's gone from our sight like a gladdening ray Of light, that awhile was given To brighten the earth; but hath past away, All pure to its source in heaven. Her heart so feeling and finely strung, It never was form'd for aching— For, when by grief it was rudely wrung It finish'd at once by breaking. And that tender flower to the cold, dark tomb, From the scenes she adorn'd is banish'd: She hath snapt from the stem in her morning bloom, Like a vision of beauty vanish'd! A mournful group at her dying bed, We watch'd with sorrowing o'er her, Till the soul shone forth with her pinions spread For a glorious world before her. But grief was hush'd in the final hour, And mute we stood around her, As the spirit escaped with a mighty power From the mortal cord that bound her. For, the delicate clay lay pale and chill, Its painful conflict over; And we heard a voice pronounce, “Be still, And know I am Jehovah! “The bars of the grave through time must be This sacred dust's protection; But they who trust, shall find in me The life and the resurrection!” THE CONQUEROR. There's blood on the laurel that wreathes his brow, And the death-cry delights his ear! The widow is wailing his victory, now, And his meed is the orphan's tear! But the might of his arm shall lose its dread, For a mightier foe comes near; The plume must be stripp'd from the conqueror's head, To nod o'er the conqueror's bier! Alone he must march to the terrible fight, For there is no army to save! His glory must set in an endless night, And his honors shall hide in the grave! He must measure the darksome valley alone, Assail'd by remorse and fear; Nor rod, nor staff help the traveller on, Nor is there a comforter near. He sinks! and none shall his requiem sound, Nor sprinkle his turf with tears; His head with a clod of the vale is crown'd, And a shroud is the buckler he wears. His terrible spirit has spurn'd its clay, As a rampart, too weak and thin, And shivering, and naked hath past away From the house where it dwelt to sin, But who shall follow the fugitive home When his last great battle is o'er; Or, the curtain remove, when it veils the doom Of the soul on an untried shore! CUPID'S WARNING. “Take heed! take heed! They will go with speed; For I've just new-strung my bow. My quiver is full; and if oft I pull, Some arrow may hit, you know, You know, you know, Some arrow may hit, you know.” “Oh! pull away,” Did the maiden say, “For who is the coward to mind A shaft that's flung by a boy so young, When both of his eyes are blind, Are blind, are blind, When both of his eyes are blind?” His bow he drew; And the shafts they flew Till the maiden was heard to cry, “Oh! take this dart from my aching heart, Dear Cupid! or else I die, I die, I die, Dear Cupid, or else I die!” He said, and smiled, “I am but a child, And should have no skill to find, E'en with both my eyes, where the dart now lies, Then, you know, fair maid, I'm blind, I'm blind, I'm blind, You know, fair maid, I'm blind! But pray, be calm, And I'll name a balm That 's brought by an older hand, And I'm told is sure these wounds to cure; 'T is Hymen applies the band; The band, the band, 'T is Hymen applies the band! Now, I must not stay— I must haste away— For my mother has bid me try These fluttering things, my glistening wings, Which she tells me were made to fly, To fly, to fly, She tells me were made to fly!” TO THE AUTOMATON CHESS PLAYER. Thou wond'rous cause of speculation— Of deep research and cogitation, Of many a head, and many a nation— While all in vain Have tried their wits to answer whether In silver, gold, steel, silk, or leather, Or human parts, or all together, Consists thy brain! When first I view'd thine awful face, Rising above that ample case Which gives thy cloven foot a place, Thy double shoe, I marvell'd whether I had seen Old Nick himself, or a machine, Or something fix'd midway between The distant two! A sudden shuddering seized my frame; With feeling that defies a name, Of wonder, horror, doubt and shame, The tout ensemble. I deem'd thee form'd with power and will; My hair rose up—my blood stood still, And curdled with a fearful chill, Which made me tremble. I thought if, e'en within thy glove, Thy cold and fleshless hand should move To rest on me, the touch would prove Far worse than death;— That I should be transform'd, and see Thousands, and thousands, gaze on me, A living, moving thing, like thee, Devoid of breath. When busy, curious, learn'd, and wise, Regard thee with inquiring eyes To find wherein thy mystery lies, On thy stiff neck, Turning thy head with grave precision, Their optic light and mental vision Alike defying, with decision, Thou giv'st them “check!” Some say a little man resides Between thy narrow, bony sides, And round the world within thee rides: Absurd the notion! For what 's the human thing 't would lurk In thine unfeeling breast, Sir Turk, Performing thus, thine inward work, And outward motion? Some whisper that thou 'rt him who fell From heaven's high courts, down, down to dwell In that deep place of sulphury smell And lurid flame. Thy keeper, then, deserves a pension For seeking out this wise invention, To hold thee harmless, in detention, Close at thy game. Now, though all Europe has confest That in thy master Maelzel's breast Hidden, thy secret still must rest, Yet, 't were great pity, With all our intellectual sight, That none should view thy nature right— But thou must leave in fog and night Our keen-eyed city. Then just confide in me, and show, Or tell how things within thee go, Speak in my ear so quick and low None else shall know it. But, mark me! if I should discover Without thine aid, thy secret mover, With thee for ever all is over; I'll quickly blow it! H. W. LONGFELLOW HYMN OF THE MORAVIAN NUNS, AT THE CONSECRATION OF PULASKI'S BANNER. The standard of Count Pulaski, the noble Pole who fell in the attack upon Savannah, during the American Revolution, was of crimson silk, embroidered by the Moravian Nuns of Bethlehem, in Pennsylvania. When the dying flame of day Through the chancel shot its ray, Far the glimmering tapers shed Faint light on the cowled head, And the censer burning swung, Where before the altar hung That proud banner, which with prayer Had been consecrated there. And the nuns' sweet hymn was heard the while, Sung low in the dim mysterious aisle. Take thy banner!—may it wave Proudly o'er the good and brave, When the battle's distant wail Breaks the sabbath of our vale,— When the clarion's music thrills To the hearts of these lone hills,— When the spear in conflict shakes, And the strong lance shivering breaks. Take thy banner!—and beneath The war-cloud's encircling wreath, Guard it—till our homes are free— Guard it—God will prosper thee! In the dark and trying hour, In the breaking forth of power, In the rush of steeds and men, His right hand will shield thee then. Take thy banner! But when night Closes round the ghastly fight, If the vanquish'd warrior bow, Spare him!—by our holy vow, By our prayers and many tears, By the mercy that endears, Spare him—he our love hath shared— Spare him—as thou wouldst be spared! Take thy banner!—and if e'er Thou shouldst press the soldier's bier, And the muffled drum should beat To the tread of mournful feet, Then this crimson flag shall be Martial cloak and shroud for thee! And the warrior took that banner proud, And it was his martial cloak and shroud. THE INDIAN HUNTER. When the summer harvest was gather'd in, And the sheaf of the gleaner grew white and thin, And the ploughshare was in its furrow left, Where the stubble land had been lately cleft, An Indian hunter, with unstrung bow, Look'd down where the valley lay stretch'd below. He was a stranger there, and all that day Had been out on the hills, a perilous way, But the foot of the deer was far and fleet, And the wolf kept aloof from the hunter's feet, And bitter feelings pass'd o'er him then, As he stood by the populous haunts of men. The winds of autumn came over the woods As the sun stole out from their solitudes, The moss was white on the maple's trunk, And dead from its arms the pale vine shrunk, And ripened the mellow fruit hung, and red Where the tree's wither'd leaves round it shed. The foot of the reaper moved slow on the lawn, And the sickle cut down the yellow corn,— The mower sung loud by the meadow side, Where the mists of evening were spreading wide, And the voice of the herdsman came up the lea, And the dance went round by the greenwood tree. Then the hunter turned away from that scene, Where the home of his fathers once had been, And heard by the distant and measured stroke, That the woodman hew'd down the giant oak, And burning thoughts flash'd over his mind Of the white man's faith, and love unkind. The moon of the harvest grew high and bright, As her golden horn pierced the cloud of white,— A footstep was heard in the rustling brake, Where the beech overshadowed the misty lake, And a mourning voice and a plunge from shore;— And the hunter was seen on the hills no more. When years had pass'd on, by that still lake-side The fisher look'd down through the silver tide, And there, on the smooth yellow sand display'd, A skeleton wasted and white was laid, And 't was seen, as the waters moved deep and slow That the hand was still grasping a hunter's bow. THE SEA DIVER. My way is on the bright blue sea, My sleep upon its rocking tide; And many an eye has followed me, Where billows clasp the worn sea-side. My plumage bears the crimson blush, When ocean by the sun is kiss'd! When fades the evening's purple flush, My dark wing cleaves the silver mist. Full many a fathom down beneath The bright arch of the splendid deep, My ear has heard the sea-shell breathe O'er living myriads in their sleep. They rested by the coral throne, And by the pearly diadem, Where the pale sea-grape had o'ergrown The glorious dwellings made for them. At night upon my storm-drench'd wing, I poised above a helmless bark, And soon I saw the shatter'd thing Had pass'd away and left no mark. And when the wind and storm had done, A ship, that had rode out the gale, Sunk down—without a signal gun, And none was left to tell the tale. I saw the pomp of day depart,— The cloud resign its golden crown, When to the ocean's beating heart, The sailor's wasted corse went down. Peace be to those whose graves are made Beneath the bright and silver sea! Peace that their relics there were laid With no vain pride and pageantry. GEORGE D. PRENTICE THE OCEAN. How beautiful!—from his blue throne on high, The sun looks downward with a face of love Upon the silent waters—and a sky, Lovelier than that which lifts its arch above, Down the far depths of Ocean, like a sheet Of flame, is trembling!—the wild tempests cease To wave their cloudy pinions!—Oh, 'tis sweet To gaze on Ocean in his hour of peace. Years have gone by, since first my infant eyes Rested upon those waters. Once again, As here I muse, the hours of childhood rise Faint o'er my memory, like some witching strain Of half-forgotten music. Yon blue wave Still, still rolls on in beauty—but the tide Of years rolls darkling o'er the lonely grave Of Hopes, that with my life's bright morning died! Look! look!—the clouds' light shadows from above, Like fairy Islands, o'er the waters sweep!— Oh I have dream'd my spirit thus could love To float for ever on the boundless deep, Communing with the elements;—to hear, At midnight hour, the death-wing'd tempest rave, Or gaze, admiring, on each starry sphere, Glassing its glories in the mirror wave;— To dream—deep-mingling with the shades of eve— On Ocean's spirits, caves, and coral halls, Where, cold and dark, the eternal billows heave, No zephyr breathes, nor struggling sunbeam falls;— As round some far Isle of the burning zone, Where tropic groves perfume the breath of morn, List to the Ocean's melancholy tone, Like a lone mourner's on the night-winds borne;— To see the infant wave on yon blue verge, Like a young eagle, breast the sinking sun, And twilight dying on the crimson surge, Till, down the deep dark zenith, one by one, The lights of heaven were streaming;—or to weep, The lost, the beautiful, that calmly rest Beneath the eternal wave—then sink to sleep, Hush'd by the beating of the Ocean's breast. Oh it were joy to wander wild and free Where southern billows in the sunlight flash, Or Night sits brooding o'er the northern sea, And all is still, save the o'erwhelming dash Of that dark world of waters;—there to view The meteor hanging from its cloud on high, Or see the northern fires, with blood-red hue, Shake their wild tresses o'er the startled sky! 'T is sweet, 't is sweet to gaze upon the deep, And muse upon its mysteries.—There it roll'd, Ere yet that glorious sun had learn'd to sweep The blue profound, and bathe the heavens in gold;— The morning stars, as up the skies they came, Heard their first music o'er the ocean rung, And saw the first flash of their new-born flame Back from its depths in softer brightness flung! And there it rolls!—Age after age has swept Down, down the eternal cataract of Time, Men after men on earth's cold bosom slept, Still there it rolls, unfading and sublime! As bright those waves their sunny sparkles fling, As sweetly now the bending heaven they kiss, As when the Holy Spirit's boding wing Moved o'er the waters of the vast abyss! There, there it rolls.—I've seen the clouds unfurl Their raven banner from the stormy west— I 've seen the wrathful Tempest Spirit hurl His blue fork'd lightnings at the Ocean's breast; The storm-cloud pass'd—the sinking wave was hush'd— Those budding isles were glittering fresh and fair— Serenely bright the peaceful waters blush'd, And heaven seem'd painting its own beauties there! Ocean farewell!—Upon thy mighty shore, I loved in childhood's fairy hours to dwell!— But I am wasting—life will soon be o'er, And I shall cease to gaze on thee—farewell!— Thou still wilt glow as fair as now—the sky Still arch as proudly o'er thee—Evening steal Along thy bosom with as soft a dye— All be as now—but I shall cease to feel. The evening mists are on their silent way, And thou art fading;—faint thy colors blend With the last tinges of the dying day, And deeper shadows up the skies ascend;— Farewell!—farewell!—the night is coming fast— In deeper tones thy wild notes seem to swell Upon the cold wings of the rising blast— I go—I go—dear Ocean, fare thee well! TO A LADY. I think of thee, when morning springs From sleep with plumage bathed in dew, And, like a young bird, lifts her wings Of gladness on the welkin blue. And when, at noon, the breath of love, O'er flower and stream is wandering free, And sent in music from the grove, I think of thee—I think of thee. I think of thee, when soft and wide The evening spreads her robes of light, And, like a young and timid bride, Sits blushing in the arms of Night. And when the moon's sweet crescent springs In light o'er heaven's deep, waveless sea, And stars are forth, like blessed things, I think of thee—I think of thee. I think of thee;—that eye of flame, Those tresses falling bright and free, That brow where “Beauty writes her name,” On fancy rush;—I think of thee. CHARLES WEST THOMSON BIRDS. Ye birds that fly through the fields of air, What lessons of wisdom and truth ye bear! Ye would teach our souls from earth to rise, Ye would bid us its grovelling scenes despise— Ye would tell us that all its pursuits are vain, That pleasure is toil—ambition is pain— That its bliss is touch'd with a poisoning leaven— Ye would teach us to fix our aim on heaven. Beautiful birds of the azure wing, Bright creatures that come with the “voice of Spring,” We see you array'd in the hues of the morn, Yet ye dream not of pride, and ye wist not of scorn. Though rainbow splendor around you glows, Ye vaunt not the beauty which nature bestows— Oh! what a lesson for glory are ye— How ye preach of the grace of humility! Swift birds that skim o'er the stormy deep, Who steadily onward your journey keep, Who neither for rest nor slumber stay, But press still forward by night and day— And in your unwearying course yet fly Beneath the clear and the clouded sky, O! may we, without delay, like you, The path of duty and right pursue. Sweet birds that breathe the spirit of song, And surround heaven's gate in melodious throng, Who rise with the earliest beams of day, Your morning tribute of thanks to pay— You remind us that we alike should raise The voice of devotion and song of praise. There 's something about you that points on high, Ye beautiful tenants of earth and sky! THE WILD BOY. See Kircher's description of the earthquake in Calabria in 1838. He sat upon the wave-wash'd shore, With madness in his eye; The surge's dash—the breaker's roar, Pass'd unregarded by— He noted not the billows' roll, He heeded not their strife,— For terror had usurp'd his soul, And stopp'd the streams of life. They spoke him kindly—but he gazed, And offer'd no reply— They gave him food—he look'd amazed, And threw the morsel by. He was as one o'er whom a spell Of darkness hath been cast; His spirit seem'd alone to dwell With dangers that were past. The city of his home and heart, So grand—so gaily bright, Now, touch'd by Fate's unerring dart, Had vanish'd from his sight. The earthquake's paralyzing shake Had rent it from its hold— And nothing but a putrid lake Its tale of terror told. His kindred there, a numerous band, Had watch'd his youthful bloom— In the broad ruin of the land, All—all had met their doom! But the last night, a mother's voice Breathed over him in prayer— She perish'd—he was left no choice But mute and blank despair. He sat alone, of all the crowd That lately throng'd around— The ocean winds were piping loud, He did not heed their sound; They ask'd him of that city's fate, But reason's reign was o'er— He pointed to her ruin'd state, Then fled—and spoke no more. MICAH P. FLINT THE HUNTER. There is a vale far in the West, And silence hovers o'er its breast; The track of man is seldom seen Upon its yet unsullied green. The wild deer fearless roves along; The red bird pours his mellow song; And the gay mock bird from on high Repeats, in playful mimicry, The varied notes, which all around, From twice ten thousand songsters rise: When, waked at morn, its groves resound Their matin chorus to the skies, Its echoes never learn'd to know The cheering voice of chanticleer, Or sturdy axeman's measured blow, Along the wild wood ringing clear. But still they mock the solemn owl, And cheat the wolf with mimic howl. The cloud-capt ridge, that bounds the west, Behind it rears a snowy crest, Whose evening shadows o'er it rest; And often when the morning cloud Has wrapt its mantle, like a shroud, Around the frowning giant's form, The radiant sun is glancing warm; And every songster, warbling sweet, In that lone valley at his feet. A winding stream the tribute brings Of melting snows and crystal springs, That gush along the mountain's side, And mingling there in silence glide Beneath green arbors, where the vine, The jessamine, and eglantine Their varying hues of beauty twine, With many a virgin floweret's bloom, And fill the air with sweet perfume. Hard by that stream there whilom stood A lonely hut, o'er which the wood Spread with its hundred arms on high A wild luxuriant canopy. And who was he, that hermit gray, That thus in loneliness would dwell? Why did he stray thus far away, To die in that sequester'd dell? His look—his form—his speech—his mien Were not of savage mould, I ween; Nor yet of that dull heavy kind, That mark so well the common mind. But such, as chain the wondering eye, Though none can tell the reason why. Oft would his broken accents tell, As half unconsciously they fell, Of joys and griefs, of hopes and fears, Now lost amid the wreck of years; Of love by blood and murder crost; Of home and friends for ever lost; And then, as though his very grief Were link'd with something like relief, A bitter smile was seen to play Across his deeply-furrow'd cheek, And, ere the eye its cause might seek, Like evening meteors flit away. His rugged dress and scanty fare Claim'd but a passing moment's care. The earth supplied his simple feast. He stripp'd his garment from the beast; Not from the tribes of nature mild, But the fierce tyrants of the wild. It was his wont o'er hill and dale To wander forth the livelong day; Till, by the star of evening pale, He turn'd to trace his homeward way. But his was not the sordid toil Of those, that range the valley wide, Or climb the mountain's grassy side, To rend from life their furry spoil. The browsing doe would raise her head, When startled by his passing tread, Would gaze perchance, with wondering eye; But had not learn'd to fear, and fly; For often, when he chanced to hear The bleating of the captive deer, His ready shot would quell its foe, And lay the tyrant panther low. JAMES A. JONES A MOOR'S CURSE ON SPAIN. With tearful eyes and swelling hearts they leave Granada's gate, And the wind blows fair to waft their barks across the narrow strait; They have hoisted sail, and they are gone,—the last of all the Moors, Whom bigot zeal hath banish'd from their much-loved Spanish shores. The remnants of those warlike tribes, who trode on Spanish necks, Whom, name you to Castilian ears, if you delight to vex; Now broken, not by sword and spear, but papal racks alone, They go, to found, where Dido reign'd, another Moslem throne. There stood upon the deck, a Moor, who had to Mecca been, Whose hoary hair proclaim'd his years beyond three score and ten. He had tasted of the water of Zemzeim's holy well, And could read the monarch's magic ring, and speak the direful spell. And there he watch'd, that aged man, till they had Calpe past, And saw, with eye of boding gloom, the land receding fast. “Blow, blow ye winds, and waft us from Xeres' glorious plain, Then be ye calm, while I pronounce a Moor's curse on Spain. “Thou didst bow, Spain, for ages, beneath a Moorish yoke, And save Asturia's mountain sons, there were none to strike a stroke; On mountain top and lowland plain, thy fate was still the same, Thy soldiers drew dull scymitars, and the crescent overcame. “The days, which saw our martial deeds, are fled to come no more; A warrior monarch rules thee now, and we give the battle o'er; Abencerrage wakes not, when the battle trumpets call, And Abderame sleeps in death, beside th' Alhambra's wall. “I leave to thee, my curse, proud Spain! a curse upon thy clime; Thou shalt be the land of dastard souls, a nursery of crime; And yet, as if to mock her sons, and make their dark doom worse, No land shall boast more glorious skies, than the lovely land I curse. “Thy kings shall wear no royal type, save a diadem alone, And their sovereignty by cruelty and a withering eye be known. 'T were waste of time to speak my curse; for, Spain, thy sons shall see, That magic can invoke no fiend, worse than thy kings will be. “And that blind faith, thou holdest from the Prophet of the Cross, A faith thy children have profaned, and its better doctrines lost; By the lords that faith shall give thee, not less shalt thou be gored, Because they grasp a crucifix, instead of spear and sword. “Bright eyes are in thy land, Spain, and thy virgins want no charms, But thou art cursed to know no truth in either heart or arms; Their bosoms shall no pillow be, for aught is kind or brave, But lull in mere illicit love, the sensual priest and slave. “Thy sway shall reach to distant lands, shall yield thee gold and gem, But a burning and a bloody sword, shall thy sceptre be o'er them, Till vengeance meet the murderous bands, from thine accursed shore, And give them of the land they seek,—a grave of clotted gore.” The Guadalquivir's banks shall be divested of their pride, The castles of our valiant race deck no more the mountain side, And Ruin's mouldering hand shall sweep to Spain's remotest shore, And all her fertile regions weep the exile of the Moor. THE LAY OF A MOUNTAIN SPIRIT. I heard the Spirit of a Mountain Discoursing with a lowland Fay. They sat beside a prattling fountain, Just ere the cock proclaim'd the day. The Mountain Spirit bears a pine, Sere neighbor to an iron mine— His locks the rock-moss gray. The little urchin shakes a vine, Whereon the rich black clusters shine, And carols he a lay, Which bids his mountain listeners note The joys that o'er the valley float. THE FAY. “I laugh to think thou wilt compare Thy mountain with our lowland air; Thy barren rocks, and leafless pines To blossom'd trees, and laden vines; Thy crags, where nought but eagles dwell, To shady groves where thrushes twitter; Thy bowers unsought of those who tell Soft secrets when the moonbeams glitter. Seest thou yon curling cloud of mist, A rural dwelling half concealing? There lives one, innocently kiss'd Of lips whose sweets are past revealing— A gentle girl who gave her hand To a poor youth, and ne'er repines For the proud palace, and broad land, But finds love richer than the mines. Thou canst not have the warbling rill, The village spire, and mossy mill, And hoary oaks, and nodding firs, And aspin with a breath that stirs; And lowing herds and fleecy flocks Are strangers to thy clime of rocks.” I heard the Spirit of mid air Say to this little lowland Fay, “Your hills are green, and valleys fair, Your rivers gently well away; But meads and valleys lovelier glow, And gentler seems the river's flow, Seen from the mountains high. Oh! could you see beyond the girth Which circumscribes this narrow earth, What splendors for your eye! From eve to morn we nothing do But gaze upon the realms of blue And wonder at the sky; While the bright stars of endless spheres Measure the rapid dance of years. “We have the sunbeams while ye lay In darkness in the vale below; We see proud navies plough their way Along the deep in paths of snow. The clime of hoary rocks our choice, Companioned with the thunder's voice, The lightning, and the bow. Nature's sublimity's aloft, Her littleness below. Ye have the delicate and soft, But we the goodlier show. “When o'er yon lowland fell disease Breathes his stern curse, and thousands fall; When with a broken heart ye wreathe The bridal favor with the pall, Then come the shuddering crowd away From the green vales ye praise so high, And seek, amidst my turrets gray, A healthful and salubrious sky. “We are the keepers of the free, Who shun the lands which tyrants sway. He who would keep unbent his knee To such, should in the mountains stay. He well deserves a realm of rocks; We give it him, the crag that blocks The despot's feet away— And he, redeem'd from slavery thus, Shall live and feel like one of us.” NATHANIEL P. WILLIS ABSALOM. The waters slept. Night's silvery veil hung low On Jordan's bosom, and the eddies curl'd Their glassy rings beneath it, like the still Unbroken beating of the sleeper's pulse. The reeds bent down the stream. The willow leaves, With a soft cheek upon the lulling tide, Forgot the lifting winds; and the long stems, Whose flowers the water, like a gentle nurse, Bears on its bosom, quietly gave way And lean'd in graceful attitudes to rest. How strikingly the course of nature tells, By its light heed of human suffering, That it was fashion'd for a perfect world! King David's limbs were weary. He had fled From far Jerusalem, and now he stood With his faint people for a little rest Upon the shore of Jordan. The light wind Of morn was stirring, and he bared his brow To its refreshing breath; for he had worn The mourner's covering, and he had not felt That he could see his people until now. They gather'd round him on the fresh green bank, And spoke their kindly words; and as the sun Rose up in heaven, he knelt among them there, And bow'd his head upon his hands to pray. Oh! when the heart is full, when bitter thoughts Come crowding thickly up for utterance, And the poor common words of courtesy Are such a very mockery, how much The bursting heart may pour itself in prayer! He pray'd for Israel; and his voice went up Strongly and fervently; he pray'd for those Whose love had been his shield; and his deep tone Grew tremulous; but oh! for Absalom! For his estranged, misguided Absalom— The proud, bright being who had burst away, In all his princely beauty, to defy The heart that cherish'd him—for him he pour'd, In agony that would not be controll'd, Strong supplication, and forgave him there Before his God, for his deep sinfulness. The hosts were number'd. At Mahanaim's gate Sat David, as the glittering thousands pass'd Forth to the battle. With a troubled eye He look'd upon their pomp, and as the helms Bent low before him, and the banners sway'd Like burnish'd wings to do him reverence, His look grew restless, and he did not wear The lofty sternness of a monarch's brow. The leader of the host came by. His form Was like a son of Anak, and he strode Majestically on, and bore his crest As men were waters, and his frame a rock. The King rose up to Joab, and came near, As his tall helm was bow'd; and by the love He bore his master, he besought him there That he would spare him Absalom alive. He pass'd with his stern warriors on; the trump And the loud cymbal died upon the ear; And as the king turn'd off his weary gaze, The last faint gleam had vanish'd, and the wood Of Ephraim had received a thousand men, To whom its pleasant shadows were a grave. The pall was settled. He who slept beneath Was straighten'd for the grave; and as the folds Sunk to the still proportions, they betray'd The matchless symmetry of Absalom. His hair was yet unshorn, and silken curls Were floating round the tassels as they sway'd To the admitted air, as glossy now As when in hours of gentle dalliance bathing The snowy fingers of Judea's girls. His helm was at his feet; his banner, soil'd With trailing through Jerusalem, was laid Reversed beside him; and the jewell'd hilt, Whose diamonds lit the passage of his blade, Rested like mockery on his cover'd brow. The soldiers of the king trod to and fro, Clad in the garb of battle, and their chief, The mighty Joab, stood beside his bier And gazed upon the dark pall steadfastly, As if he fear'd the slumberer might stir. A slow step startled him. He grasp'd his blade As if a trumpet rang; but the bent form Of David enter'd, and he gave command In a low tone to his few followers, And left him with his dead. The king stood still Till the last echo died; then throwing off The sackcloth from his brow, and laying back The pall from the still features of his child, He bow'd his head upon him, and broke forth In the resistless eloquence of wo. ‘Alas! my noble boy, that thou shouldst die! Thou, who wert made so beautifully fair! That death should settle in thy glorious eye, And leave his stillness in this clustering hair! How could he mark thee for the silent tomb, My proud boy, Absalom! ‘Cold is thy brow, my son! and I am chill When to my bosom I would try to press thee; How was I wont to feel my pulses thrill, Like a rich harp string, yearning to caress thee, And hear thy sweet “My Father!” from these dumb And cold lips, Absalom! ‘The grave hath won thee; I shall hear the gush Of music and the voices of the young; And life will pass me in the mantling blush, And the dark tresses to the soft winds flung; But thou no more with thy sweet voice shalt come To meet me, Absalom! ‘And oh! when I am stricken, and my heart Like a bruised reed is waiting to be broken; How will its love for thee, as I depart, Long for thine ear to catch its dying token! It were so sweet, amid death's gathering gloom, To see thee, Absalom! ‘And now farewell! 'tis hard to give thee up, With death so like a gentle slumber on thee;— And thy dark sin—oh! I could drink the cup, If from this wo its bitterness had won thee— May God have call'd thee like a wanderer home, My erring Absalom!” He cover'd up his face, and bow'd himself A moment on his child; then giving him A look of melting tenderness, he clasp'd His hands convulsively, as if in prayer; And as a strength were given him of God, He rose up calmly, and composed the pall About him decently, and left him there As if his rest had been a breathing sleep. BETTER MOMENTS. My mother's voice! how often creeps Its cadence on my lonely hours! Like healing sent on wings of sleep, Or dew to the unconscious flowers. I can forget her melting prayer While leaping pulses madly fly, But in the still unbroken air Her gentle tone comes stealing by, And years, and sin, and manhood flee, And leave me at my mother's knee. The book of nature, and the print Of beauty on the whispering sea, Give aye to me some lineament Of what I have been taught to be. My heart is harder, and perhaps My manliness hath drunk up tears, And there 's a mildew in the lapse Of a few miserable years— But nature's book is even yet With all my mother's lessons writ. I have been out at eventide Beneath a moonlight sky of spring, When earth was garnish'd like a bride, And night had on her silver wing— When bursting leaves and diamond grass, And waters leaping to the light, And all that makes the pulses pass With wilder fleetness, throng'd the night— When all was beauty—then have I With friends on whom my love is flung Like myrrh on winds of Araby, Gazed up where evening's lamp is hung. And when the beautiful spirit there, Flung over me its golden chain, My mother's voice came on the air Like the light dropping of the rain— And resting on some silver star The spirit of a bended knee, I' ve pour'd her low and fervent prayer That our eternity might be To rise in heaven like stars at night! And tread a living path of light I have been on the dewy hills, When night was stealing from the dawn, And mist was on the waking rills, And tints were delicately drawn In the gray East—when birds were waking With a low murmur in the trees, And melody by fits was breaking Upon the whisper of the breeze, And this when I was forth, perchance As a worn reveller from the dance— And when the sun sprang gloriously And freely up, and hill and river Were catching upon wave and tree The arrows from his subtle quiver— I say a voice has thrill'd me then, Heard on the still and rushing light, Or, creeping from the silent glen Like words from the departing night— Hath stricken me, and I have press'd On the wet grass my fever'd brow, And pouring forth the earliest First prayer, with which I learn'd to bow, Have felt my mother's spirit rush Upon me as in by-past years, And yielding to the blessed gush Of my ungovernable tears, Have risen up—the gay, the wild— As humble as a very child. THE SOLDIER'S WIDOW. Wo! for my vine-clad home! That it should ever be so dark to me, With its bright threshold, and its whispering tree! That I should ever come, Fearing the lonely echo of a tread, Beneath the roof-tree of my glorious dead! Lead on! my orphan boy! Thy home is not so desolate to thee, And the low shiver in the linden tree May bring to thee a joy; But, oh! how dark is the bright home before thee, To her who with a joyous spirit bore thee! Lead on! for thou art now My sole remaining helper. God hath spoken, And the strong heart I lean'd upon is broken; And I have seen his brow, The forehead of my upright one, and just, Trod by the hoof of battle to the dust. He will not meet thee there Who bless'd thee at the eventide, my son! And when the shadows of the night steal on, He will not call to prayer. The lips that melted, giving thee to God, Are in the icy keeping of the sod! Aye, my own boy! thy sire Is with the sleepers of the valley cast, And the proud glory of my life hath past, With his high glance of fire. Wo! that the linden and the vine should bloom And a just man be gather'd to the tomb! Why, bear them proudly, boy! It is the sword he girded to his thigh, It is the helm he wore in victory. And shall we have no joy? For thy green vales, O Switzerland, he died! I will forget my sorrow—in my pride! THE HINDOO MOTHER. It was a gentle eve in Hindoostan. The rains were past, and the delighted earth Was beautiful once more, and glittering leaves Were lifting lightly on their beaten stems, And glancing to the pure, transparent sky, Like a pleased infant smiling through its tears. Clouds linger'd in the west, and tints were drawn By sunset fingers on their skirts of gold, And they were floating as serenely there, As if the children of the restless storm Could sleep upon the azure floor of heaven. Deep ran the holy Ganges, for the rain Had swollen it from Thibet to the sea. Its flow was turbid; and, as if the winds Were not forgotten by the multitude Of its strange waters, they were leaping up, And with a wondrous glory gathering The mantle of the sunset over them. How frequently these living passages Of nature's book are opened, and how few Are the high hearts that know them, and can feel Their eloquence and beauty! Meina stood Upon the breathing carpet of the shore, Gazing on the sky and river. There was much In the dark features of the young Hindoo, That should have won a gentler history. She had the Eastern eye, with its dark fringe And shadowy depth of lustre; but, beyond The elements of beauty, there was writ A something that the wounded roe would trust For shelter from its hunters. Her closed lips Were delicate as the tinted pencilling Of veins upon a flower; and on her cheek The timid blood had faintly melted through, Like something that was half afraid of light. There was no slighter print upon the grass Than her elastic step; and in her frame There was a perfect symmetry, that seem'd Aerial as a bird's. It was the hour For worship in her land; and she had come, With the religion of a high, pure heart, To bow herself in prayer. A darker mind Might pray at such an hour; but she had caught The spirit of the scene; and, as her eye Follow'd the coursing of the golden waves, Or rested on the clouds that slept above, Like isles upon the bosom of the sea, Her soul was swept to music like a harp, And she knelt down in her deep blessedness To worship the High Maker. A she pray'd, Her beautiful young boy—a very dream, As he might be, of infant loveliness, With his dark hair upon the summer wind, And the sweet laugh of a delighted child Like music on his lips—came leaping by, And, flinging a light wreath upon her brow, Sprang onward like a bounding antelope. She turn'd a moment—might she not, for him? Him, whom she cradled in the whispering tree, And gather'd to her bosom in the hush Of the still night?—to know if he was there. 'T was but a moment, and she bow'd again; And, as the murmur of her silver tone Stole out upon the wind, her images Of majesty came back, and she was fill'd, Like a deep channel by the whirlwind swept, Again, with the rich rushing of her prayer. The shadows of the stealthy evening came Silently on; but she was up, in thought, Among the crystal palaces of light; And a still prompting came to her, to pray That the poor spirit of a passing world, With all its fond, but frail idolatries, Might on the altar of her God be flung. She breathed it, and along the holy shore She heard the whisper of the waters creep: “Thine is the victory, Meina!”—Was it won? Won in its cold, bereaving cruelty? Won from the pride of woman? from her love? Won from thy boy! young mother? No! oh, no! She had forgotten him! He was too young, Too purely, beautifully young, to die! And then the waves repeated to the shore, And the light echo heard it: “Give him up!” And Meina heard it: “Give him to thy God!” And the strong heart arose! One arrowy pulse Of an acuter agony than death; One fearful shiver at the searching thrill, And she had won—aye, with her glorious boy Upon her very breast—the victory! Oh! let the erring oftener be forgiven, That, in the shadowy twilight of the mind, They stray a little from the perfect way! If there is evidence in silent leaves, And the still waters, of a present God, And all who hear not messages of grace, Must gather from its dim and hidden words Their better solaces; remember ye Who reckon lightly of the poor Hindoo, That, in the scattering of the leaves of life, His page was written more imperfectly. The beautiful sun arose, and there was not A stain upon the sky; the virgin blue Was delicate as light; and, as the east Eclipsed night's pale and starry jewelry, The pure intensity of noon stole on, Like the soft deepening of a northern eye. “Come! my own glorious boy!” and forth he sprang, As he had been created of the morn A spirit and an element of light. “Come! Come!” and he was bounding airily Beside his stately mother, laughing out His lisping prattle of the promised boat, As if her words had been in playfulness, “That the bright waves should float him on to heaven.” The morning mist stole up, as Meina knelt To offer him to God. Her eyes were dim; But her fine forehead, and her calm, still lip, Were fearfully subdued; and as the cloud Which clothes the lightning slumbers, so they slept. Her soul was in its strength. She held her boy Upon her bosom, till she felt the throb Of his warm pulses numbered on her heart, And her low, leaden cadences, kept on! His silken hair, as delicately soft As the light wind that stirr'd it, floated up, As if to plead at her transparent cheek; But she had wooed its kisses till it came To be a fond idolatry, and now She nerved her as the strong heart answer'd it. And the low words broke severally on, Distinctly as a common orison! There is a period in the wreck of hopes By the affections garnered, calmer far Than an untried serenity. It comes With the stern conflict ever, and awaits The passage of that hour, as if the soul Were girded, and had champion'd suffering; And it is strange, how a weak human heart Will thus be quiet like a hushing storm, And, with a fetter on its pulses, wait To measure spirits for the mastery! The low “Amen!” died on the silent air, And Meina's heart was ready. The young boy Sprang joyously away, as if her arms Had prison'd him too long; and, as he saw The painted boat heave lightly to the swell Upon the reedy shore, and caught the breath Of her wreathed helm of flowers, he gave a shout, In his impatient gladness, and away, Like a warm vision of aerial birth, He bounded to implore that she would come. Calmly and steadily came Meina on, Led by her victim boy. The boat was there Among the tall wet reeds, and she went in And scann'd its light frame over, and arranged Its mimic ornaments; and then again, When she had seen it all, and he had grown Impatient, she began to note once more The frailties in its lightly plaited reeds, As if she did not know that it was meant To kill. It is a wonderful effect Of nature in the heart, that in the strength Of a mistaken duty, it will turn, And almost trifle with its tenderness, As if it half misgave that all was wrong. “Come!” and he sprang into his mother's arms With a light leap, and, scarcely faltering In his gay laugh, he look'd into her face, And in a tone of fondness whisper'd her, “Will the boat bear, dear mother?” She had quell'd Her feelings until now; had nerved herself To the light grace with which he bounded by; Had heard his voice, and look'd upon his hair In its light, breezy floatings, and had shut Her heart up, with an iron thought, to all. But this one doubt, half sadness as it came From his delighted lips, and with his look Of childlike and appealing confidence, Was keener than a mother's heart could bear! She bow'd her head, and struggled, as if life Were bursting from its seal; and, as the thought Rush'd over her to take her idol back, And keep him for her God, he murmur'd low, “And are you sure, my mother?”—“No! my son!” And the strong tide of nature gather'd back With a resistless energy. She clasp'd Her boy convulsively, and he had lived To quicken, in its gifted elements, The radiant spirit written on his brow, But a high strengthening she knew not of, Awaken'd her, and pressing down her lips In a long fervent kiss upon his cheek, She hush'd him into peace, and lifting up Her face to heaven, she breathed the name of God, And laid him down—for ever! The light bark Went smoothly with the tide, and floated on Till his dark eye was scarcely visible. On, and yet on, she bounded! The bright waves Seem'd playful in their leaping joyousness, And the curl'd ripple feather'd at the prow Like a glad thing of life. Had death grown slow? Or were the waters “stay'd,” that they should keep Their cold embraces from him? On, still on, With her quick undulations! Hope revived In the sick heart of Meina, and she rose To gaze more keenly forward. He was there, And his small arms were lifted; and she thought That, as he toss'd them upward, she could hear A cadence of his sweet and silvery voice Like a delighted shouting. It died off, And then again she heard it. Was it joy That broke upon her ear? oh! was there joy In that long cry, thou mother? Hark to it! 'T is like the arrowy piercing of the wind! He moveth, and she bade him to be still! He riseth! 't is his boyish restlessness! Look, Meina! Does he dash his little hands, In mirth, upon the waters? Hark! once more! “Mother!” He calls thee! Is thy child afraid? Again! How very fearfully it comes! “Help! Mother!” 't is a cry of agony! He sinks! Fly! Fly! he calls to thee! Oh fly! “Mother!” God help thee! Dost thou see him now?

The calm, reposing shades of evening hours, Thrown from the forest-tops on fields of flowers; The gentle hill-side sloping to the plain; The faint blue islet on the distant main; And, over all, the reaching bend of sky, Where floating clouds pass on, and others lie In heavenly watch, that the gone sun hath shaded With hues like rainbow arches broke and braided; With idle oar uplift, the gliding barge, O'er winding waters, with close-shaven marge; And then, the wavy voices of the tide, Lapsing along the narrowing river's side; The low winds, passing mute across the plain, Then murmuring their forest tones again, And freshening to a cool and plaintive breeze, Catching a dirge-like measure from the trees; Such scenes before mine eye, such sounds that glide Along the woody path and water's side, Fling on my mind a deep poetic feeling, From every hue and tone a beauty stealing: Like a rich mantle it comes folding o'er me, Woven of all the harmonies before me; And then I close my eyes, and seem to see, Within, the feeling thus enthralling me. In such a musing mood a vision pass'd Sudden before me, and was still—then cast Off from mine eye the dream's obscurity, And was unveil'd, in its fine mystery. Such reveries the sages of old days Were wont to have, and call them visiting rays From caring Deities, that they might then Bless, with good thoughts and truth, the souls of men; And on their eyes holy revealings broke, And in their ears great teaching voices spoke. The vision. It came forth, and there it stood, And I beheld it; the tall, solemn wood Smiled greenly in the slant sunbeams, that linger'd Yet on the hovering cloud shapes, rosy finger'd, Pointing Day's hidden place; along its edges Wander'd a brooklet, loosing, 'neath the sedges Frequent its silver course, and only telling Its secret roaming by its musical welling; And thence went down the long smooth slope; below Spread out the meadow, with its exquisite show Of tall grass waving verdantly, and flowers, Lifting their grateful eyes for morning showers; And clumps of bunchy hazel; farther still Went by the river, as if with grave will Going down straight, or curving with strong grace, Passing, for ever, to his destined place. Yet the sweet vision. From the dusky verging Of the gray wood's recess it came emerging, A dreamy shape, as of the sea-born daughter, Light as a mist wreath o'er a moonlit water; Yet with calm eye distinct, and lip and brow Like the low sun-tints on a hill of snow. She spake to me; her voice, the utterless tone That comes down by us when we muse alone, Calling our names familiarly, and when We lift our pleased eyes, straight is still again. Poet, with bent ear, to thee Call I, the spirit of poesy. Music's elder sister I, That dwell i' the earth, and sea, and sky, Chosen from my birth to be Attendant on the Deity. And through air, and earth, and sea, By his power, I speak to thee. My voice is in the “thunder's mouth,” And in the breath of the sweet south; In the hollow sounding sea Of storms; and in its quiet glee, When the winds of summer run Along the pathways of the sun. I am in the torrent's going, And the brooklet's silver flowing; In the great, heart-chilling cranch Of the coming avalanche, When the groaning forests cower, Like slaves beneath his steps of power, And beast, and bird, and peasant cry Once, in death's strong agony— All noises of destruction blending; And in the flaky snow's descending, On whose feathery, printless bed, Silence lies embodied. When the pleasant spring-time comes To palaces and cotter's homes, My voice is in the low heard laughings That stir in the air, like fairy quaffings; 'T is I who tune the summer trees To their soft breezy cadences, And in their autumn wails draw near To sing a moral in man's ear I, who in the pattering rain Soothe the dying harvest's pain, So my liquid talkings then Are happy sounds to husbandmen. When the lighten'd clouds go by, Unveiling the sun's great eye, I soar up in its warm blaze, And divide the coming rays; Contriving, with poetic knowing, What bending tints to wreathe his bow in; Then, when my gamut is complete, I tread it with my silver feet, Till the depths of ether ring To the soft tints mingling; It was my stealing voice that came, On the glance of morning's flame, To old Memnon's shrine, to make Tones divine, for mystery's sake. Through the dark earth's cavy halls, Ore to ore in music calls; And gem to glancing gem, by me Is stirr'd with answering melody. Mine is all the harmony Of sounds to hear, and sights to see; All the joy of the glad earth, And the blue sky's holier mirth. I, with calm consistency, Unroll the mazes of the sky; That the sage's soul may scan The Deity's harmonious plan, So his thought to men may tell The orderings that in heaven do dwell, That worn age, and prime, and youth, Alike may know of God's good truth. Then, poet, bend thine ear to me, Attendant on the Deity. Thus as she spake, all things appear'd to see And feel the presence of divinity. The brooks went downward with a gladlier cheer; The trees bow'd gently, with rejoicing fear; Beneath her feet the gay earth shone new-vested, And o'er her head a skyey glory rested; Her beck was to me, and my thought once more Heard her calm voice, more serious than before. Mortal, dost thou seek to find The rich joy of deathless mind? Would'st thou have thine heart to be Full of fine humanity? Would'st familiarly converse With this beautiful universe, And have all its excellence Pour'd upon thy spirit's sense; All loveliness pause in thine eye, And its dark things pass thee by, Feeling all that God hath given Of happiness below his heaven? Bow to me: and I will come, Bringing peace to thy calm home; Touching all its eyes to shine With a lustre caught from thine; Lightening, with happy ease, All thy social companies; Giving all their songs and smiles Merriment and witful wiles; And in all their gentle doing Hearty friendliness imbuing. Yet should sorrow come to steal Aught from thee of cheer or weal, Ill fortune of thy store bereave thee, All thy friends of sunshine leave thee, And, like hurrying clouds that flee O'er the noon's tranquillity, Cares, and strong anxieties Darkly o'er thy couch arise; Then thee by the hand I'll take, And lead thee by the quiet lake, So look upon its skyey plain, Till thy heart grow calm again; Or, beneath the springing joy Of the blue day's canopy, By the hill-side, where have birth Fountain streams that bless the earth, Till thy spirit shall rejoice Freshly in their gushing voice, I would give the recompense Of my generous influence, That thou should'st not sigh for aught By wasting care and toiling bought. Brazen Fame's peace-scaring noise, And Ambition's lightning toys, Should be discord to thine ear, And darkness to thine eye appear; Thou shouldst gladly flee away From the rude world's busy fray, In my bowers to build thine home, And in my pleasant ways to roam. I would bring, for thy content, Good things of each element; And all beautiful should be Subservient to thy gaiety. Thou shouldst climb the mountain top, And hear its piny tones come up; Watching, with a glad surprise, To see the glorious sun uprise; Then go down beside the brook, Whiffling from a leafy nook, And, resting there beneath the tree, I would whisper dreams to thee. When the spring-day sun was bright, Thou shouldst walk with fancies light; And the opening forest's sheen, Cool thine eye with its soft green. What time mournful autumn grieves Through the sere wood's falling leaves, Thou shouldst cull their skeletons, Where the shrouded streamlet runs, And musing on their swift decay, Know that thou art frail as they; Then go home, with step sedate And sober eye, to contemplate: So I o'er thy heart would pour The treasurings of Wisdom's store. If thou wouldst thy soul should live In all of heaven that earth can give, Mortal, bow thyself to me, Favor'd of the Deity. And silently I bow'd to her; and then Wander'd above me one accepting strain, And I rose up; of that sweet vision there Was not one tint upon the dewy air. Yet, o'er the pale hills of the distant west, Went calmly down one golden star to rest; And as on me its lingering glance was cast, I knew her smile; thus had her spirit pass'd: And in that moment, I became to her, And yet am now, a happy worshipper. JAMES G. BROOKS GREECE. 1822. Land of the brave! where lie inurn'd The shrouded forms of mortal clay, In whom the fire of valor burn'd And blazed upon the battle's fray: Land, where the gallant Spartan few Bled at Thermopylæ of yore, When death his purple garment threw On Helle's consecrated shore! Land of the Muse! within thy bowers Her soul entrancing echoes rung, While on their course the rapid hours Paused at the melody she sung— Till every grove and every hill, And every stream that flow'd along, From morn to night repeated still The winning harmony of song. Land of dead heroes! living slaves! Shall glory gild thy clime no more? Her banner float above thy waves Where proudly it hath swept before? Hath not remembrance then a charm To break the fetters and the chain, To bid thy children nerve the arm, And strike for freedom once again? No! coward souls! the light which shone On Leuctra's war-empurpled day, The light which beam'd on Marathon, Hath lost its splendor, ceased to play; And thou art but a shadow now, With helmet shatter'd—spear in rust— Thy honor but a dream—and thou Despised—degraded in the dust! Where sleeps the spirit, that of old Dash'd down to earth the Persian plume, When the loud chant of triumph told How fatal was the despot's doom?— The bold three hundred—where are they, Who died on battle's gory breast? Tyrants have trampled on the clay, Where death has hush'd them into rest. Yet, Ida, yet upon thy hill A glory shines of ages fled; And fame her light is pouring still, Not on the living, but the dead! But 't is the dim sepulchral light, Which sheds a faint and feeble ray, As moon-beams on the brow of night, When tempests sweep upon their way. Greece! yet awake thee from thy trance, Behold thy banner waves afar; Behold the glittering weapons glance Along the gleaming front of war! A gallant chief, of high emprize, Is urging foremost in the field, Who calls upon thee to arise In might—in majesty reveal'd. In vain in vain the hero calls— In vain he sounds the trumpet loud! His banner totters—see! it falls In ruin, freedom's battle shroud: Thy children have no soul to dare Such deeds as glorified their sires; There valor 's but a meteor's glare, Which gleams a moment, and expires. Lost land! where genius made his reign, And rear'd his golden arch on high; Where science raised her sacred fane, Its summits peering to the sky; Upon thy clime the midnight deep Of ignorance hath brooded long, And in the tomb, forgotten, sleep The sons of science and of song. Thy sun hath set—the evening storm Hath pass'd in giant fury by, To blast the beauty of thy form, And spread its pall upon the sky! Gone is thy glory's diadem, And freedom never more shall cease To pour her mournful requiem O'er blighted, lost, degraded Greece! THE DIRGE. I saw her in life's morning bloom, In youth and beauty brightly gay, And little thought the savage tomb So soon would steal her charms away: I saw her when her eye was bright As the blue vestment of the sky, And little thought the fearful night Of the death angel was so nigh! And it was mine to see her fade, To see her wither day by day; And it was mine to see her laid Beneath the cold, repulsive clay; And then the sad funereal bell Bore the death music to my ear— 'T was hope's and love's expiring knell. Yet I was left to linger here. It little boots my spirit now, To think that she was fair and kind; White were the lilies on her brow, And stainless was her gentle mind. Her's was the holy, heavenly love, Which beacons life's beclouded way, Such as the seraphs feel above, Where heaven's eternal sunbeams play. She moved along in loveliness, As woman moved at Eden's birth, And seem'd an angel sent to bless The weary wilderness of earth. Too soon the earth received her form: Nor worth, nor innocence could save Her bosom from the earthy worm— Her bonny blossoms from the grave! And many sorrow'd o'er her lot, And many wept beside her bier— By heaven!—too soon she was forgot, And time full early chased the tear; Yes! ere the grass began to spread Its verdure o'er her, fresh and green, Her memory from their breasts had fled, As if the loved one ne'er had been! Yet there was one that loved her well, On whom her trusting heart relied, Whose soul clung fondly to her spell, Nor cared for all the world beside: And on his heart the seal is set; That image dwells for ever more, To cherish still its fond regret, Till life's last agony is o'er. FREDERIC S. HILL MUSINGS. I love sometimes to tune my simple lute, And, as an echo to its softer strains, Give utterance to the thoughts that often rush Like an o'erflowing current through my soul. What though my name, unknown amid the host Of those who crowd around Apollo's shrine, Shine not emblazon'd on the rolls of Fame? What though my wandering feet have never trod The flowery Parnassus,—nor my lips Imbibed poetic inspiration from The pure Castalian spring?—still in the hour When clouds of disappointment lower around, And veil the scenes of beauty sketch'd by hope In all her rainbow hues, the chord I touch, May waken memory from her trance, and soothe The throbbing of my heart. Sweet Poesy! Thy full outpourings can assuage the breast That heaves in tumult. O, if thou appear,— Thy loosen'd tresses floating wide, thine eye Beaming with an unearthly brightness, then The rapt enthusiast in his ecstacy, Forgets the chilling atmosphere of earth, The selfish heartlessness of those around, And thinks he wanders in thy sun-light sphere, Holding “high converse” with thy chosen ones. Up from the barren heath on which he treads, The bloom of the primeval Eden springs; Transparent waters meet him in his path, And figures leap out even from the air, Clothed in light drapery, and beautiful As Houris in the Moslem Paradise. Seek'st thou the spirit who with magic wand Can work these wonders? Come then; let us stand Here, on the precipice that overhangs That everlasting deep. O God! it is A sight too solemn to look out upon, Unless with reverence for thy majesty, And for thy greatness, awe. See how the waves Come surging onward—heaving, heaving on, As if a consciousness of their own might Gave a new impulse to them. See! they strike The battlements fix'd by Jehovah's hand, And the tremendous roar tells their defeat. Look! look again—a coronal of foam White as a snow-wreath, now surmounts the wave And sparkles in the sun—and now—'t is gone! But night comes on: let us begone—we'll climb Yon mountain, though it be a toilsome task. Let no unhallow'd word pass from thy lips, Nor impure thought dwell in thy heart—for now We leave the earth and all its vanities Below—and come up to a place, that seems The threshold of th' Eternal's presence. Hush! Here in this region silence sits supreme, And now she slumbers 'neath the canopy That darkness spreads around. The sense is pain'd By the intensity of stillness, for Even the breeze, although its dewy wing Bring freshness with its stirring, in its flight Is noiseless as the eagle, when he wheels Alone and undisturb'd in the mid air. The sky above looks dark and fathomless, Like the great ocean in a troubled dream; With a strange splendor burn the stars, and yet Diffuse no light around, but rather seem Like orbs that separate the realm of light From chaos. 'T is a fearful spot—like that Which David dreamt of, when he spoke of Him, Who maketh darkness his abiding place. Still shall we on?—Aye, even to yon crags. How fearfully Earth's bosom quakes! It heaves With tremulous throbbing, and sends forth deep tones, Like thunder from a necromatic cave. Or nature's groans of agony. Gaze now At yonder mighty burst of waters—see— E'en the gigantic rocks, that look as firm As adamantine pillars, based below The centre dark—have yielded, and retired To make free course for the fierce torrent's plunge, As did the waves for Israel's fugitives, When the Red Sea was smitten by the rod That had been given to Israel's chosen judge. The white mist rises from the cataract In rolling clouds, like the unceasing smoke Of incense going to the throne of God, And o'er the silvery sheet a rainbow spreads:— A brilliant halo round the awful brow Of majesty. Now we will seek the glen That blossoms in rich beauty, like the fields Of classic Tempe, in their loveliness. It is a place meet for the home of those Who leave the busy world—and in the pure,— The blest communion of each other's hearts, Live in their hallow'd intercourse with Him Who giveth them the boon of sweet content. Of old, such haunts as this, the wood-nymphs sought, And when the burning noon look'd hotly down, Met with the Naiades of the neighboring streams; These blew their wreathed shells, the others join'd With delicate trumpets made of hollow flowers, And fragrance mingled with the blending notes. Here oft I sit when eve with silent pace Steals on—when only here and there a star Emits a doubtful ray, as though it were Some gentle spirit coming forth to see This earth by summer twilight—then I love To listen to the music issuing out In untaught freedom from each gushing fount, And to the melody among the leaves Of the green woods. For Fancy then can deem These sounds the low responsive utterings From Nature's temple to her worshippers. Here, thou mayst woo the spirit of Poesy, Here thou shalt find her, in her gentler moods. A FRAGMENT. Methought I stood Upon a field where slaughter once had rode With reeking scimitar, and plumes that hung Flapping upon his helmet, drench'd with blood;— And there were graves, that had been digg'd By soldiers' hands—the turf turn'd up in haste, With blades still hot from battle—and the grass Was thick—a heart had gush'd on every root, And it was fed with clotted gore, until It lifted up its tall, rank spires of green, Around that place of carnage, marking out The spot where desolation's hand had fall'n. So where the ruins of some city lie,— Destruction's monuments—luxuriantly The mantling ivy spreads its leafy arms O'er every mouldering shaft—embracing close Each fluted column, as it were to hide The lone prostration of the beautiful. In that unholy place, methought I stood In midnight solitude—and one approach'd, Whose step resounded 'mid the tombs, as if The sheeted dead were troubled—and their sleep Disturb'd and broken by the stranger's walk. He had a princely presence, and his glance Might make the boldest cheek grow pale with awe; His brow was that of majesty—and yet An unquell'd spirit seem'd at work within— A mighty spirit for that bosom heaved, And there were flashes passing o'er that brow Like lightning o'er a marble firmament. He trod upon a grave—there was a sound— A bursting sound beneath the hollow earth, And he who lay there, woke—and rose;—and yet No terror smote that proud one's heart—nor stay'd The beating of his pulses, but he gazed In calmness at the form, who beckon'd him Forth from that Golgotha. The spectre led, And they toil'd on, in paths that mortal foot Till then had never press'd. The cataract, That like the wrath of God bore down—was cross'd; And when the tempest in its fury came, They battled onward—and the strife was like The combat of a band of giants, when They fight for domination, and put forth, Their utmost strength, until their sinews snap, And the blood rushes like a lava stream. That youthful warrior follow'd still the track Of him clothed in unearthly robes, until They reach'd a mountain's base; then in a voice That caused my flesh to quake, and the cold sweat To stand upon my brow, he bade him mount The precipice, and scale the jutting cliff. There was a rustling of the panoply Which he had on—an outstretch'd arm—and then Blue lightning shot across a dome that stood Upon that rocky parapet—I saw A fiery inscription on the base Of that aspiring temple— AMBITION— PERSIAN SONGS. THE MAIDEN TO HER LOVER. Before the winning breeze could steal Morn's sprinkled pearl-drops from this rose, I cull'd it, that it might reveal The tale my lips dare not disclose. Its leaves of virgin tenderness, Where I have press'd a kiss for thee,— Its blush of maiden bashfulness,— Both tell of love and secrecy. For they have bound my flowing curls, And told me, that ere eve's mild hour, They'll deck me with their gems and pearls, To shine the queen of Irad's bower. But I will toil and tempest brave, And roam the desert at thy side, And kiss thy feet, and live thy slave, Rather than be proud Irad's bride. THE LOVER'S REPLY. Thou bright one!—let thy lover calm The breast that heaves such throbbing sighs, And still thy quivering lips, whose balm Is like the breath of Paradise. For, by thy token-flower, that brought The seal thy crimson lips impress'd,— By these thin leaves, with sweetness fraught, Like shrines where spikenard blossoms rest;— By thy pure eyes, whose diamond glow Steals through their lashes timidly; By thy dark locks, that loosely flow, In glossy curls, luxuriantly;— And by that bosom's snowy light, Which 'neath the veil swells half-conceal'd— As oft through clouds of fleecy white A heaven of beauty is reveal'd;— By these, and by my blade, I swear, That little blue-vein'd foot of thine Shall never tread the soft couch, where The silken tents of Irad shine. But thou thy Kosru's bride shalt be, And seek, with him, rich Cashmir's vale; There, thou shalt wander, wild and free As the young fawn, o'er hill and dale. There, like the notes of Eden's bowers, Mahomet in speaking of the sweetness of the Persian dialect used in his day said that it would be the language of Paradise. Thy strains shall listless time beguile; There I will gaily pass the hours, In the clear sunshine of thy smile. OLIVER C. WYMAN THE DEVOTEE. Thou of the pale and lofty brow, The intellectual eye, Whose form and beaming look avow A soul, too sternly proud to bow Even to destiny— Say, to what deep and dread design, Does thy great heart incline? With beings of another sphere Thy mystic converse seems; Like that of some prophetic seer, Who hid in caverns dark and drear, Revolves foreboding dreams; Yet thy fix'd eye's undying flame Betokens nought of shame. Say, dost thou commune with the stars, And pierce the world beyond! Seest warriors in their flaming cars, In other spheres, wage quenchless wars, While Love and Hope despond? No! pure the pageantry must be— Thine eye lights gloriously. Say, dost thou see a blushing cheek Through flowing, gleamy hair? And is there one who kneels to speak His thoughts of love—in words too weak, For the fair creature there? Thou smil'st—but no assent appears, And now gush forth thy tears. Speak, I conjure thee by the names Of mother and of sire; By every whispering hope that claims Remembrance; by each spell that flames The keen heart of desire; Speak things of terror, words of fire, I'll listen and admire. “Youth! in yon sparkling firmament I see a promised heaven. When mortal toil and man's intent, When every evil passion, sent To earth, with earth is riven— Then shall I claim in yon bright sky A joy that cannot die.” TO THE CLOUDS. Ye, whose dark foldings are the throne And palace of the monarch—Storm— Ye, whose refulgent draperies shone Above, ere earth or wave had form; And spreading like a sea of gold, O'er chaos, beauty threw and grace On graceless things; and proudly told Of him who gave ye shape and place. Hail! Hail! I greet ye with a smile; For ye to me speak words of power; And bear my thoughts, from visions vile, Back to creation's natalh our. Ye seem the monuments of things And ages pass'd with time away; To ye my sighing spirit clings,— Memorials of the ancient day! The deep and muttering thunder breathes— Your voices murmur in mine ear; The awful lightning, flashing, wreathes Your brows in dazzling smiles severe; The rain-drops from your bosoms burst In torrents o'er earth's spreading flame— Ye seem to weep, that sin hath cursed And doom'd the fallen race of men. What if your changing shadows take New fashionings from midnight's shroud! What if the lights of morning break Without a trace of evening's cloud! Ye do not speak the less of Him, And of the world's primeval birth, Than if ye moveless stood—Ye dim And threatening curtains of the earth! Doth not the bright and scented flower Decay and die in winter's gloom! Doth not returning summer's hour Revive and wake its fragrant bloom! And, from the natal hour of light, Have ye not learn'd to waste and fly Before the conquering sunbeam's might, And clasp ye not again the sky! Memorials of His power, who sees Earth, air, and ocean, time and space; Who gilds with leafy crowns the trees, And tears the mountain from its base; Who bids fair summer deck the earth, When winter's form its beauty shrouds; And wakes the sparrow's song of mirth:— His subjects hail! Illumined clouds! THE BRIDAL. There was a sound of music sweet as gentle notes that swell At midnight from the moonlit caves of yonder leafy dell; Where, at the dewfall, spirits cluster round the sleeping flowers, To sing their plaintive melodies, and wreath their wild-rose bowers. There were gallant forms and beauteous ones around the altar press'd, And dazzlingly the torches flash'd on plume and burnish'd crest; 'T was a scene whereon a painter's eye or poet's lip might dwell, When the young De Courcy wedded with the peerless Gabrielle. He was a Knight a maid might love in days of wild romance, For braver never wielded brand or placed in rest the lance; Free as the wind that o'er his mountain-castle wildly blew, Yet gentle as her gentle heart—and oh! as fervent too. And through that land of tale and song, she shone the fairest one, Where eyes are as its sparkling stars, and hearts are like its sun; And still the wandering troubadour full many a tale can tell Of her the ever brightest gem—the peerless Gabrielle. Upon the altar-stone, there knelt the maiden young and fair, Her blushes hid beneath a veil of flowing raven hair; And by her side the lofty one, whose knee, like his of yore, Had never bow'd save in the stirrup, and to God, before. Oh! it is a touching sight when the lovely and the pure Come up to pledge their faith, through sin, through sorrow to endure; And never yet has man been bound within more potent spell, Than linger'd in the heart and smile of peerless Gabrielle. But as they knelt before the shrine, came on a sound of fear— Each warrior grasp'd his sabre as it met his startled ear; And through that quiet, holy place, the trumpet's summons rang, The fearful burst of musquetry, and meeting sabres clang: In pour'd the savage mountain-clan like some enfranchised flood, And fierce the struggle 'twixt the brave and that stern band of blood; For gallantly the warriors fought, and valiantly they fell Around the altar-stone where lay the dying Gabrielle. A shot had pierced the gentle heart of that fair virgin-bride, She perish'd in her loveliness, in her young beauty's pride; But where is he whose arm should guard, whose battle-blade defend, The foremost in the raging fight, most eager to contend; Could he forsake that sweetest rose, amid the deadly strife, To purchase after hours of shame, to bear a hated life?— Whose hand is clasp'd with that of one in life beloved so well— De Courcy died a hero's death beside his Gabrielle. SONG OF THE BEE. Away, away, to the anxious flower That droops and pines for its truant bee; With beauty renew'd like the morning hour 'T will wait for my coming with anxious glee. Ah little, but little, the rose-spirit dreams Of the last dear place of her wanderer's rest— Like the evening dew, in the mountain streams, She would waste should I tell of the tulip's breast. Away, away, for the earliest kiss Must be mine from the freshest and sweetest rose; Oh! there 's nought upon earth like the young bee's bliss, When the morning rose-leaves over him close. Hid from the beam of his rival—Sun, Couch'd in the bosom of beauty's flower, He rests, till its choicest treasures are won, From the scorching ray or the drenching shower. W. G. CROSBY TO A LADY, WITH A WITHERED LEAF. What offering can the minstrel bring, To cast upon affection's shrine? 'T was hard thy magic spell to fling O'er the fond heart already thine! Thou wouldst not prize the glittering gem, Thou wouldst but cast the pearl away; For thine is now a diadem, Of lustre brighter far than they. I will not bring the spring-tide flower, Reposing on its gentle leaf; Its memory lives but for an hour— I would not thine should be as brief. My heart!—but that has long been thine— 'T were but a worthless offering; The ruin of a rifled shrine, A flower that fast is withering. My song!—'t is but a mournful strain, So deep in sorrow's mantle clad, E'en echo will not wake again The music of a strain so sad. A wither'd leaf!—nay, scorn it not, Nor deem it all unworthy thee; It grew upon a hallow'd spot, And sacred is its memory. I pluck'd it from a lonely bough, That hung above my mother's grave, And felt, e'en then, that none but thou Could'st prize the gift affection gave. She faded with the flowers of spring, That o'er her lifeless form were cast,— And when I pluck'd this faded thing, 'T was shivering in the autumn blast. 'T was the last one!—all—all were gone, They bloom'd not where the yew trees wave; This leaf and I were left alone, Pale watchers o'er my mother's grave. I mark'd it, when full oft I sought That spot so dear to memory; I loved it—for I fondly thought, It linger'd there to mourn with me! I 've moisten'd it with many a tear, I 've hallow'd it with many a prayer: And while this bursting heart was clear From guilt's dark stain, I shrined it there. Now, lady, now the gift is thine! Oh, guard it with a vestal's care; Make but thine angel heart its shrine, And I will kneel and worship there! ASA M. BOLLES THE ALBUM. In that proud temple of the Sun, Which rose to heaven on Balbee's towers, Amid the altars, there was one, Whose only offerings were flowers; When morning o'er the glittering dome Was blushing from her eastern home, Fresh garlands to that shrine were given Of flowers—bright flowers bathed in heaven. And Persian girls, with deep blue eyes Of love, and clustering raven hair, And brows as pure as their own skies, Were gather'd with their rose-wreaths there, To breathe their orisons and twine Their garlands on that lovely shrine, Whose incense, at the day-god's flame, Rose to the skies, from whence it came. Beautiful there those bright ones knelt, Where Morn's first holy light was flowing Pure from its crystal throne—they felt The day-spring in their bosom's glowing With life and joy—as through the aisles Their god came beaming all in smiles And love—oh! who could wish to part From that sweet worship of the heart! The Persian's fane has perished—gone The shrine—the worship of the free All—all have faded like the tone Of music o'er the moonlit sea— No laughing eyes—no raven hair— No dewy wreaths are sparkling there— Faded is every peerless gem, And beauty has gone down like them. But love will have its altars still, And there is yet a worship born, Of hearts, that feel the joyous thrill Of light and beauty in their morn; Hope's deep-toned music lingers there Amid the roses and the air. Breathes incense all—while from above Bliss sparkles o'er the shrine of love. Such be this volume—let no trace Of sadness blight one leaflet here— The heart's pure offerings to grace And loveliness should have no tear Amid their blossoms—but the dews Of heaven should mingle with their hues; And all things fair and brighest twine Their wreaths of gladness o'er the shrine. HENRY J. FINN THE TRIBUTE OF TRUTH. The golden meshes of gay delight That beckon the senses but to beguile Have flash'd their mad and meteor light On the soul, enslaved by the witching wile. And passion has heated the heart of one, Who deem'd him blest in its burning beam As the simple fly, in the summer's sun, Floats on the ray, through its daily dream. But the charm is gone—and the chain is cleft— That menaced to bind my fancy ever; Yet the link inlaid with gems, is left, Which love has cemented ne'er to sever. Farewell! for the rainbow tints are fled From the wings of pleasure. But much more sweet And pure, is the lovelier light that 's shed From thy look of life, when our glances meet. And memory smiles at the distant sea, Where the waters roll o'er the wreck of pride; For the calms of summer have come with thee, My boon, my blessing—and my bride! THE FUNERAL AT SEA. Deep mists hung over the Mariner's grave When the holy funeral rite was read; And every breath on the dark blue wave Seem'd hush'd, to hallow the friendless dead. And heavily heaved on the gloomy sea, The ship that shelter'd that homeless one— As though, his funeral-hour should be, When the waves were still, and the winds were gone. And there he lay, in his coarse, cold shroud— And strangers were round the coffinless: Not a kinsman was seen among that crowd, Not an eye to weep, nor a lip to bless. No sound from the church's passing-bell Was echoed along the pathless deep, The hearts that were far away, to tell Where the Mariner lies, in his lasting sleep. Not a whisper then linger'd upon the air— O'er his body, one moment, his messmates bent; But the plunging sound of the dead was there— And the ocean is now his monument! But many a sigh, and many a tear, Shall be breathed, and shed, in the hours to come— When the widow and fatherless shall hear How he died, far, far from his happy home! EMMA C. EMBURY JANE OF FRANCE. Pale, cold and statue-like she sate, and her impeded breath Came gaspingly, as if her heart was in the grasp of death, While listening to the harsh decree that robb'd her of a throne, And left the gentle child of kings in the wide world alone. And fearful was her look; in vain her trembling maidens moved, With all affection's tender care, round her whom well they loved; Stirless she sate, as if enchained by some resistless spell, Till with one wild, heart-piercing shriek in their embrace she fell. How bitter was the hour she woke from that long dreamless trance; The veriest wretch might pity then the envied Jane of France; But soon her o'erfraught heart gave way, tears came to her relief, And thus in low and plaintive tones she breath'd her hopeless grief: “Oh! ever have I dreaded this, since at the holy shrine My trembling hand first felt the cold, reluctant clasp of thine; And yet I hoped—My own beloved, how may I teach my heart To gaze upon thy gentle face and know that we must part? “Too well I knew thou lovedst me not, but ah! I fondly thought That years of such deep love as mine some change ere this had wrought: I dream'd the hour might yet arrive, when sick of passion's strife, Thy heart would turn with quiet joy to thy neglected wife. “Vain, foolish hope! how could I look upon thy glorious form, And think that e'er the time might come when thou wouldst cease to charm? For ne'er till then wilt thou be freed from beauty's magic art, Or cease to prize a sunny smile beyond a faithful heart. “In vain from memory's darken'd scroll would other thoughts erase The loathing that was in thine eye, where'er it met my face: Oh! I would give the fairest realm, beneath the all-seeing sun, To win but such a form as thou mightst love to look upon. “Wo, wo for woman's weary lot if beauty be not hers; Vainly within her gentle breast affection wildly stirs; And bitterly will she deplore, amid her sick heart's dearth, The hour that fix'd her fearful doom—a helot from her birth. “I would thou hadst been cold and stern,—the pride of my high race Had taught me then from my young heart thine image to efface; But surely even love's sweet tones could ne'er have power to bless My bosom with such joy as did thy pitying tenderness. “Alas! it is a heavy task to curb the haughty soul, And bid th' unbending spirit bow that never knew control; But harder still when thus the heart against itself must rise, And struggle on, while every hope that nerved the warfare dies. “Yet all this have I borne for thee—aye, for thy sake I learn'd The gentleness of thought and word which once my proud heart spurn'd; The treasures of an untouch'd heart, the wealth of love's rich mine, These are the offerings that I laid upon my idol's shrine. “In vain I breathed my vows to heaven, 't was mockery of prayer; In vain I knelt before the cross, I saw but Louis there: To him I gave the worship that I should have paid my God But oh! should his have been the hand to wield the avenging rod?” STANZAS. Oh! knowest thou, dear one, the love of youth With its wayward fancies, its untried truth; Yet cloudless and warm as the sunny ray That opens the flowers of a summer's day, Unfolding the passionate thoughts that lie 'Mid feelings pure as an angel's sigh; Till the loftiest strength of our nature wakes As an infant giant from slumber breaks: Oh, knowest thou, dear, what this love may be? In earlier days such was mine for thee. Oh, knowest thou, dear one, of woman's love With its faith that woes more deeply prove; Its fondness wide as the limitless wave, And chainless by aught than the silent grave; With devotion as humble as that which brings To his idol the Indian's offerings; Yet proud as that which the priestess feels, When she nurses the flame of the shrine while she knee Oh, knowest thou, dear, what this love may be? Such ever has been in my heart for thee. Oh knowest thou the love of a poet's soul, Of the mind that from heaven its brightness stole, When the gush of song, like the life-blood springs Uncheck'd from the heart, and the spirit's wings Are nerved anew in a loftier flight To seek for its idol a crown of light; When the visions that wake beneath fancy's beam, But serve to brighten an earthly dream: Oh, knowest thou, dear, what this love may be? Such long has been in my heart for thee. Oh, tell me, dear, can such love decay Like the sapless weed in the morning ray? Can the love of earlier, brighter years Be chased away like an infant's tears? Can the long tried faith of a woman's heart Like a summer bird from its nest depart? Can affection nursed within fancy's bowers, Find deadly herbs 'mid those fragrant flowers? Oh! no, beloved one, it cannot be: Such end awaits not my love for thee. Youth's pure fresh feelings have faded now; But not less warm is love's summer glow; Dark frowns may wither, unkindness blight The heart where thou art the only light; And coldness may freeze the wild gush of song, Or chill the spirit once tameless and strong; And the pangs of neglected love may prey Too fatally, dear, on this fragile clay; But never, Oh! never beloved, can it be That my heart should forget its deep fondness for thee. HENRY WHITING ONTWA. Far up the lengthen'd bay we urge, To where the triple streams converge And on its ready head distil The tribute sent from distant hill— Now mounting up the sinuous bed Of Wagouche to its marshy head, We toil against the foamy leaps— Or wind where still the current sleeps 'Mid seas of grain, the boon of heaven To sterile climes in bounty given. At last we reach the narrow mound— The wide diverging waters bound— Where, almost mingling as they glide In smooth and counter-current tide, Two rivers turn in sever'd race, And flow, with still enlarging space, Till one rolls down beneath the north And pours its icy torrent forth, While—glowing as it hurries on— The other seeks a southern zone. Here, as the heaven dissolves in showers, The boon on either stream it pours, And the same sunbeams, as they stray, On both with light impartial play; But onward as each current hies, New climes and sunder'd tropics rise, And, urging, growing, as they run, Each follows down a varying sun, Till, o'er her tepid Delta spread, The Michi-sipi bows her head,— While Lawrence vainly strives to sweep His gelid surface to the deep. Scarce did the low and slender neck The progress of our passage check; And ere our bark—which, dripping, bore The marks of rival waters o'er— Had lost in air its humid stain, 'T was launch'd, and floating on again— 'Mid isles in willow'd beauty dress'd That deck'd Ouisconsin's yellow breast. The stream ran fast, and soon the scene Changed into frowns its smiles serene. Nature arose in troubled mood, And hills and cliffs, of aspect rude, Hoary with barrenness, save where The stunted cedar hung in air Fix'd in the rocks that beetled high, Darken'd the current rushing by— Oft choked and broken in its pass By mighty fragments' clogging mass, Sever'd, mayhap, by bolt of heaven, And down the steep in thunder driven. Our rapid bark, ere twice the day Had shone upon its downward way, Turn'd its light prow, in upward course, To stem the Michi-sipi's force— Where her broad wave rolls on amain, Sever'd by ‘thousand isles’ in twain, And giant cliffs, with theatening frown, Conduct her prison'd current down. Full many a stream, on either side, Through the cleft walls sends forth its tide, Descending far from distant plains, Where in its gloom the Prairie reigns, Seated in grandeur on its throne Amid a desert world alone. Oft up the steeps, by rugged path Sloped by the winter torrent's wrath, We toil'd, where high the sumach hung, And tendral vines around it clung, Checking our way with woven bowers, Or twining over head their flowers; While higher still, in dizzier break, The trembling aspen tree would shake— And oft the wand'ring eye would meet With sparkling crystals 'neath the feet, Rudely enchased on some dark stone Shining with lustre not its own. Hard the ascent, but fair the sight That spread beneath the lofty height, Where river, isles, and meadows drew Their varied pictures to the view,— Or would the downward eye forbear To dwell on scene so soft and fair, 'T was but to raise a level glance And all was rude and bold at once, Where the dark Bluffs, half bare, half crown'd, Arose in gloomy sternness 'round. For many a day the stream we stemm'd, Through isles that still its bosom gemm'd, While oft, where back the cliffs retired, The waving plain, in green attired, Smiled in the dark and deep recess, Like guarded spot in wilderness; (Where Hamadryades might sport, Or fairies hold their dewy court.) At last our bark, 'mid eddies toss'd And foam that all the wave emboss'd, Was warn'd—ere yet the torrent's roar Was heard—to turn its keel ashore. Now clambering up the steep ascent, Our course along the brink was bent, Where the descending, broken flood, On rocks that firm its force withstood, Show'd signs of mightier conflict near Whose rumblings now rose on the ear. Why checks my guide on yonder rise, And bends to earth in mute surprise, As the Great Spirit of the air Had burst upon his vision there? 'T was the vast Cataract that threw Its broad effulgence o'er his view, Like sheet of silver hung on high And glittering 'neath the northern sky. Nor think that Pilgrim eyes could dwell On the bright torrent as it fell, With soul unawed. We look'd above And saw the waveless channel move, Fill'd from the fountains of the north And sent through varied regions forth, Till, deep and broad and placid grown, It comes in quiet beauty down— Unconscious of the dizzy steep O'er which its current soon must sweep. The eye hung shuddering on the brink, As it had powerless wish to shrink, Then instant sunk, where 'mid the spray All the bright sheet in ruin lay. The tumult swells, and on again The eddying waters roll amain, Still foaming down in angry pride, Till mingling rivers smooth its tide. Nor did the isle, whose promont wedge Hangs on the torrent's dizzy edge, Escape the view; nor sister twin That smiles amid the nether din— Closed in the raging flood's embrace, And free from human footstep's trace; Where the proud eagle builds his throne And rules in majesty alone. Approaching still and more entranced As still the ling'ring step advanced, We stood at last in pleased delay O'erlooking all the bright display, While the gay tints of western flame That down the day's obliqueness came, On hanging sheet and level stream Darted a soft and slanting beam. GEORGE W. PATTEN THE ISLE OF LOVE. There's a bright sunny spot where the cinnamon trees Shed their richest perfumes to the soft wooing breeze; Where the rose is as sweet and as bright is the sky, As the balm of thy breath and the glance of thine eye. And clouds pass as soon o'er that beautiful Isle, As the tear on thy cheek disappears at thy smile. Come! haste thee, fair Irene, oh! haste thee with me, To that far distant land in the Ægean sea. Light breezes are swelling the gossamer sail, Of my love-freighted bark for the evergreen vale; And loudly the night bird is chanting her lay, To rouse thee from slumber—away and away— We'll land at the groves and the wild flowers there, I'll twine in a wreath for thy soft flaxen hair; And we'll roam like the antelope, reckless and free, O'er that bright sunny Isle in the Ægean sea. Soft music is there—for the mermaiden's shell, Is often heard winding through mountain and dell; And the song of the sea spirits steals from the shore, With the low sullen sound of the waves' distant roar. And the tones of thy voice—oh! how sweetly they'll blend, With the strains which the harps of the Ocean Nymphs send; While I list to the notes as they float on the lea, Of that far distant land in the Ægean sea. Far—far 'mid its bowers sequester'd and lone, Young Love hath erected a jessamine throne; And sworn with an oath which no mortal may say, That none but the fairest its sceptre shall sway. Then haste thee, fair Irene, oh! haste thee tonight, While the stars are yet pale, and the moon is yet bright, For, love, he hath destined that sceptre for thee In that bright sunny Isle of the Ægean sea. THE WARRIOR. “The morning sun is shining bright upon the battle plain, And still thou sleep'st!—wake! warrior, wake—and take thy steed again, The gore he 's shaken from his mane, and now 't is floating fast, Upon the breeze as it was wont amid the battle blast, Thrice hath the war-peal thunder'd past since thou hast sunk to sleep, Hath not it changed thy dreary dream, nor broke thy slumber deep? Thrice hath the foemen's banner red in triumph floated by; Did not the gleaming of its stars arrest thy closing eye? Thy charger hot hath raised his voice as if thy rest to break; He listens for his rider's call—wake! slumbering warrior—wake!” “Hush! gentle stranger, hush that strain,” a weeping mother sung, And sadly on the sighing winds the mournful music rung, “Hush, gentle stranger, hush that strain—my heart is lone and drear, Thou canst not wake my warrior boy, who sleeps in silence here. I 've comb'd his flowing flaxen hair, and from it wiped the dew, Come, gaze upon the features pale, which oft I 've loved to view, And if thy bosom e'er hath throbb'd a warrior's joys to know, Oh! read them on that sunken cheek—and in a mother's wo. —They said, my boy, that Fame would twine a laurel green for thee, Alas! alas! that it should leave the cypress sad to me.’” THE MOTHER. “She sleeps! how long she sleeps! the sun hath sunk beneath the west, And risen twice, yet still she keeps that deep and placid rest. Why do they pass before me thus, her slumbering form to view? Come hither, brother, thou and I will gaze upon her too; But stay! we will not look there yet, but let us wait until The midnight stars are beaming bright, and all around is still, Save when the moaning winds sweep by in whispers low and deep, And then together we will go and view her in her sleep.” “Sister! tread softly! hark! that sound! 't was but the midnight hour Tolling so harsh and heavily from yonder distant tower; Come, sister, tremble not, 't is true the time is lone and drear, And dimly burns the taper dark that sits beside the bier; But thou didst breathe a prayer to me, a whisper'd prayer but now, To come at midnight hour and gaze upon thy mother's brow. This is the hour, and we have pass'd along the silent hall, And thus, as by the dead we stand, I take away the pall— And here the coffin's lid I move—and here I raise the veil— Turn, gentle sister, turn and look upon her features pale; Stoop down and kiss her pallid cheek—though cold and damp it be, It is the same which in thy mirth so oft was press'd by thee. And clasp in thine the lifeless hand that lays upon her breast, Where pillow'd in thine infant years thou oft hast sunk to rest.” “My eyes grow dim!—sweet brother, haste! and come with me away! Is this the form which once I loved! this ghastly thing of clay? They told me that she only slept—and that she still was fair, As when upon her brow I used to part her raven hair. Is this my mother?—No, oh! no,—not this on which I 've gazed, Her eyes were bright like angel's eyes, but these are fix'd and glazed, Her lips were smiling like the sky that never knew a cloud; But these are silent, closed and pale—pale as the winding shroud. My eyes grow dim, sweet brother, haste and come with me away— No, this is not the form I loved—this ghastly thing of clay.” WILLIS G. CLARK LINES WRITTEN AT AN UNKNOWN GRAVE. A mournful tone the night-air brings, about this lonely tomb, Like thoughts of fair and faded things amid life's changeful gloom; Deep shadows of the past are here!—and fancy wanders back, When joy woke in this mouldering breast, now pass'd from life's worn track: When hope made glad his spirit here, as the pure summer-rain Pours its sweet influence on the earth, with all her flowery train; While buds were tossing in the breeze beneath a deep blue sky— And pleasure's chant was in his ear, ere he had gone to die! Youth, too, was his—its morning hour—its sunlight for his brow— Its phantoms shone, for him to chase, in giddy round, but now; Perchance the glee of his young heart—the glancing of his eye Hath been upon another shore, beneath a brighter sky:— The night-tones have no tales to tell—no history to unfold— The tall, sere grass, that waves alone, in sadness o'er his mould— These speak not—deep in dreamless rest, the peaceful sleeper lies; There is no pang to rend his heart,—no grief to dim his eyes! Perchance, in halcyon hours of Youth, a transient dream of love Came to his brain while earth was joy, and heaven was light above;— When his soul was fill'd with gladsome thought—and in idolatry He bow'd him to that holy shrine, which in our youth we see; A star above life's troubled scene—a gleam upon its wave— A ray, whose light is soon eclipsed, in the darkness of the grave; A song, which like the mirthful tone of wild birds on the wing, Dies when the dewy even-tide enshrouds a sky of spring! I know but this—Death's shadows dwell upon his deep-seal'd eye; Vainly earth laughs in joy for him, or the blue summer-sky— The gales may tell where flowers repose, or where the young buds swell; Their soft chant may not enter here, within this voiceless cell— Flowers, dreams, and grief, alike are past—and why should man reply, When life is but a wilderness whose promise soon may die— 'T is but a home, where all must sleep—change, which to all must come— A curtain, which o'er ALL must spread its deep, o'ershadowing gloom! The wail of the expiring year is in the deep brown woods— The leaf is borne upon the stream, in its dark solitudes:— The clouds are on the chasten'd hills—the floods are wild and high— The mournful pall is lingering, where faded blossoms lie:— Then here should monitory thoughts be treasured in the breast That life is but a changeful hour—and Death, a holy rest, Where grief's loud wail or bursting tears ne'er to its stillness come; But silence reigns within its hall, wrapp'd in its shrouded home! EXTRACT FROM A NEW YEAR ADDRESS. Come to my soul, thou Spirit of the Lyre! 'T is the deep, cloudy midnight; and the wail Of the cold wind is on its strings of fire, And on the far hills, rising, dimly pale! Ah! wake thy murmurs on the troubled gale— Pour the sad requiem o'er the dying year— Give to man's thoughtful eye a passing tale Of days departed, bright as beauty's tear, Or summer's festal sky, ere autumn clouds drew near! From the dark sepulchre of years gone by, A deeply mournful voice is murmuring, “Where are the dreams of old!—the spirit high Mounting like eagles on the fearless wing? Where is the pride of that luxuriant spring, Which pour'd its light on Rome—on Babylon? —The wreaths of Time around their temples cling— Their halls are dust!—the gold of Chaldee won— Where sails the bittern's wing, when the bright day is done Even thus with the past year;—its morn was gay— Sweet flowers were on the earth's green bosom springing— And streaming sunlight bless'd the sky of May, Where early birds their joyous way were winging, A dream of love to youth's fresh spirit bringing; And all was gladness o'er the laughing earth:— To the tall oak the sunny vine was clinging— And sending echoes, e'en to home and hearth, The sweet blue streams, set free, pour'd out a voice of mirth Then came the summer's prime—its long, bright day— With garniture of wood, and field, and stream— The golden sun outpour'd his gladdening ray, And the blue sea danced in his boundless gleam;— When like a soft, and faint-heard song, would seem The cheerful murmur of the drowsy bee, About the full grown flowers—and like a dream Spread out for man's blest eye the scene might be, While a soft, breezy chant, was in the green-wood tree! Then frown'd the autumnal cloud; the shrouded sky Its multitude of gleams and stars withdrew; The flowers grew pale; and summer-brooks were high, And imaged back no more a heaven of blue;— No moon smiled out upon the evening dew— The squirrel's footstep rustled in the glen— The red leaves fell, and fitful night-winds blew; And to the bright south-west, away from men, Far, on their glancing plumes, roam'd the wild birds again! But man is changing in the changing year— Shadows o'ersweep the day-spring of the heart; When gazing back upon Time's dim career, He marks youth's cheerful images depart! Then will lone Memory her tales impart Of early buds, all ashes in the urn:— Mournful and sweet her reveries!—but we start— And from lost years unto the present turn— Closing from mind's deep cell, the voiceless thoughts that burn! How many dreams have to the dust gone down— Witness thou fading and departed year! Since last thy spring enwreathed her flowery crown,— Lo! gentle forms have lain upon the bier, Where thoughtful sorrow pour'd the pensive tear! Genius and beauty gather'd to their rest— Death, in all climes, is on his way of fear— His arrow trembles in Youth's budding breast— Oh! were his power decay'd, how might Earth's love be bless'd! ROBERT MORRIS THE BROKEN HEARTED. I would that thou wert dead, devoted one, For thou art all too pure to linger here; Life's joyous sands to thee have fleetly run, And sorrow's hand hath made thy being sere— Thy girlhood was a pure and artless dream, And many a sunny hope has thrill'd thy breast, And many an air-blown bubble gilt life's stream, Flash'd for a moment—broke, and sunk to rest— Emblems of youth and loveliness were they, And like hope's fairy visions pass'd away. I would that thou wert dead, forsaken girl, That high pale brow enshrined within the tomb, For as with gentle winds still waters curl, So fades at sorrow's touch young beauty's bloom— Thou art too pure and fair for this cold earth, A thing too guiltless long to dwell below, Thy voice has lost its cadences of mirth, The glory has departed from thy brow— And youth's pure bloom has left thy virgin heart, And beauty like a phantom will depart. I would that thou wert dead, for life to thee Is as a broken reed—a wither'd flower; Dark shadows rest upon thy destiny, And storms of fate around thy fortunes lower— Wedded to one thy bosom cannot love, Banish'd from him thine every thought employs, Thou art in heart a bruised and wounded dove, And earth to thee can yield no future joys, Wearily passes life and time with thee, A dusky shadow dims thy destiny. I would that thou wert dead, devoted one, And thy bright spirit disenthrall'd of clay; Even as the dew-drop wastes beneath the sun, Thus by disease thy being wastes away— Oh, who that knew thee when thou wert a child, With a glad voice and heaven unfolding eye, A creature as the snow flake undefiled, With a bright lip and cheek of rosy dye, Oh, who that knew thee then, can see thee now, Nor wonder for the beauty of thy brow. I would that thou wert dead, and sanctified— Thy spirit with high element is fraught, And that which scorn and cruelty defied, The lingering stealth of pale disease has wrought— Yes, death is near thee now, sweet Genevieve, And thou shalt haste to meet him with a smile; It is in vain thy gentle sisters grieve, Thy soul shall soon flee by each starry isle, That glitters brightly through the calm blue skies, Like white lids lifted from pure spirit's eyes. Thou soon shalt die, sweet martyr, and the earth Will nurture gentle flowers above thy grave, Sweet emblems of thy being and thy birth, With cypress leaves around thy tomb shall wave— And when the pensive stranger wanders nigh, His lips shall waft a tributary prayer, For her who soon shall prematurely die, For her whose seraph form shall moulder there— Farewell, sweet Genevieve—'t is sad to part— Farewell, thy beauty shrouds a breaking heart. EBENEZER BAILEY THE TRIUMPHS OF LIBERTY. Spirit of freedom, hail!— Whether thy steps are in the sunny vale, Where peace and happiness reside With innocence and thee, or glide To caverns deep and vestal fountains, 'Mid the stern solitude of mountains, Where airy voices still prolong From cliff to cliff thy jocund song,— We woo thy presence: Thou wilt smile upon The full heart's tribute to thy favorite Son, Who held communion with thee, and unfurl'd In light thy sacred charter to the world. We feel thy influence, Power divine, Whose angel smile can make the desert shine; For thou hast left thy mountain's brow, And art with men no stranger now. Where'er thy joyous train is seen Disporting with the merry hours, Nature laughs out, in brighter green, And wreathes her brow with fairy flowers: Pleasure waves her rosy wand,— Plenty opens wide her hand,— On Rapture's wings, To heaven the choral anthem springs,— And all around, above, below, Exult and mingle, as they glow, In such harmonious ecstacies as play'd, When earth was new, in Eden's light and shade. But not in peaceful scenes alone Thy steps appear,—thy power is known. Hark!—the trump!—its thrilling sound Echoes on every wind, And man awakes, for ages bound In leaden lethargy of mind: He wakes to life!—earth's teeming plains Rejoice in his control; He wakes to strength!—and bursts the chains Whose rust was in his soul; He wakes to liberty!—and walks abroad All disenthrall'd, the image of his God. See, on the Andes' fronts of snow The battle-fires of Freedom glow, Where triumph hails the children of the sun, Beneath the banner of their Washington. Go on, victorious Bolivar! Oh! fail not—faint not—in the war Waged for the liberty of nations! Go on, resistless as the earthquake's shock, When all your everlasting mountains rock Upon their deep foundations. And Greece,—the golden clime of light and song, Where infant genius first awoke To arts and arms and godlike story,— Wept for her fallen sons in bondage long: She weeps no more;—Those sons have broke Their fetters,—spurn the slavish yoke, And emulate their fathers' glory. The Crescent wanes before the car Of liberty's ascending Star, And Freedom's banners wave upon The ruins of the Parthenon. The clash of arms rings in the air, As erst it rung at Marathon;— Let songs of triumph echo there! Be free! ye Greeks, or, failing, die In the last trench of liberty. Ye hail the name of Washington; pursue The path of glory he has mark'd for you. But should your recreant limbs submit once more To hug the soil your fathers ruled before Like gods on earth,—if o'er their hallow'd graves Again their craven sons shall creep as slaves, When shall another Byron sing and bleed For you!—oh, when for you another Webster plead! Ye christian kings and potentates, Whose sacrilegious leagues have twined Oppression's links around your States, Say, do ye idly hope to bind The fearless heart and thinking mind? When ye can hush the tempest of the deep, Make the volcano in its cavern sleep, Or stop the hymning spheres, ye may control, With sceptred hand, the mighty march of soul. But what are ye? and whence your power Above the prostrate world to tower, And lord it all alone? What god—what fiend—has e'er decreed, That one shall reign, while millions bleed To prop the tyrant's throne? Gaze on the ocean, ye would sway:— If from its tranquil breast, the day Shine out in beams as bright and fair As if the heavens were resting there, Ye, in its mirror surface, may See that ye are but men; But should the angry storm-winds pour Its chainless surges to the shore, Like Canute, ye may then A fearful lesson learn, ye ne'er would know,— The weakness of a tyrant's power,—how low His pride is brought, when, like that troubled sea, Men rise in chainless might, determined to be free. And they will rise who lowly kneel, Crush'd by oppression's iron heel, They yet will rise,—in such a change as sweeps The face of nature, when the lightning leaps From the dark cloud of night, While heaven's eternal pillars reel afar, As o'er them rolls the Thunderer's flaming car,— And in the majesty and might That freedom gives, my country, follow thee, In thy career of strength and glorious liberty. Immortal Washington! to thee they pour A grateful tribute on thy natal hour, Who strike the lyre to liberty, and twine Wreathes for her triumphs,—for they all are thine, Woo'd by thy virtues to the haunts of men, From mountain precipice and rugged glen, She bade thee vindicate the rights of man, And in her peerless march, 't was thine to lead the van. Though no imperial Mausoleum rise, To point the stranger where the hero lies, He sleeps in glory. To his humble tomb,— The shrine of freedom,—pious pilgrims come, To pay the heart-felt homage, and to share The sacred influence that reposes there. Say, ye blest spirits of the good and brave, Were tears of holier feeling ever shed On the proud marble of the regal dead, Than gush'd at Vernon's rude and lonely grave, When from your starry thrones, ye saw the Son He loved and honor'd, weep for Washington! As fade the rainbow hues of day, Earth's gorgeous pageants pass away: Its temples, arches, monuments, must fall; For Time's oblivious hand is on them all. The proudest kings will end their toil, To slumber with the humble dead,— Earth's conquerors mingle with the soil, That groan'd beneath their iron tread, And all the trophies of their power and guilt, Sink to oblivion with the blood they spilt. But still the everlasting voice of fame Shall swell, in anthems to the Patriot's name, Who toil'd—who lived—to bless mankind, and hurl'd Oppression from the throne, Where long she sway'd, remorseless and alone, Her scorpion sceptre o'er a shrinking world. And though no sculptured marble guards his dust, Nor mouldering urn receives the hallow'd trust, For him a prouder mausoleum towers, That Time but strengthens with his storms and showers,— The land he saved, the empire of the Free,— Thy broad and steadfast throne, Triumphant Liberty! ADDRESS TO THE MERMAID. Exhibited in this country some years since. What have we here? a man or a fish? a fish; he smells like a fish: a very ancient and fish-like smell!—A strange fish!—I shall laugh myself to death at this PUPPY-HEADED monster—a most scurvy monster! Shakspeare. Art thou indeed, what thou would'st seem to be, Imprison'd in that curious box of thine, A veritable daughter of the sea, Like Aphrodité born in foam and brine? Though, I must say, were such the queen of Love, I marvel greatly at the taste of Jove. But thou, perhaps, some ages since, wast fair, The envy of all mermaids far around; Then that bald pate of thine with azure hair, That undulated with the waves, was crown'd; Thou art, howe'er, a mermaid's mummy now, And with a wig should'st hide that wrinkled brow. Hast thou e'er sported in the coral bowers, That deep beneath the Indian waters grow, Where gems bud forth, and wave the sea-green flowers, With graceful motion, as the currents flow? For there the tempests have no power, that sweep With madness o'er the surface of the deep. Perchance 't was thy delight, in former times, To rest by moon-light on the ocean-rocks, And to the hum of waters chant thy rhymes, Or with those fingers curl thy humid locks; Then wo to any luckless bark for aye, Whose pilot listen'd to thy treacherous lay. Is it not glorious to behold the gems, That shine like stars in ocean's crystal caves?— The groves, where emeralds bud on amber stems, Moving harmonious with the rocking waves?— And all the gorgeous mysteries, that sleep Beneath the endless waters of the deep? There, we may guess, the Nereids delight To build their garnish'd grottoes, fair to see, With domes of living diamonds, that as bright Shine out, as suns in the immensity Of heaven, while all their ruby pavements blush, As through their clefts the shouting waters rush There shells of pleasant forms and nameless hues To alabaster columns cling; and there Such flowers spring up, as never drank the dews, Nor breathed the freshness of the upper air; But fairer, lovelier far, their tints that glow On the pure sand, like rainbow hues on snow. And mighty Argosies, that moved in pride, Like living things, along the troubled deep, Lie many a fathom now beneath the tide; And gallant chiefs, and fearless sailors sleep, In kingly state, on beds of pearl and gold, Who for a biscuit had their birthrights sold. Oh! could'st thou tell,—if thou indeed hast seen, “For in those eyes there is no speculation,”— The wonders hid beneath the ocean green, T' would mad the knowing ones with admiration, And many a learned bachelor would swear That thou, in spite of all thy teeth, art fair! But why should I ask questions of a thing, That hears not, sees not, knows not,—only grins? And grin you may, so long as quarters ring, For, says the adage, “let him laugh that wins! Being a siren, well may you entice The unwary once,—you cannot cheat me twice. Would I possess'd a charm to ope the cell Of glass, when thou art fasten'd like a reel Within a bottle: I could never tell How this got in; but could my fingers feel That scaly skin of thine, there 's “a shrewd doubt” 'T would be no puzzle why you'll not come out. But go in peace, thou thing of “shreds and patches”— Go not, howe'er, where Doctor Mitchill is; For he will mangle thee, if he but catches A glimpse of thy uncouth and monkey phiz, And then will swear, in spite of thy long tail, Thou art no more a fish than was his whale! GRENVILLE MELLEN DREAM OF THE SEA. I dreamt that I went down into the sea Unpain'd amid the waters—and a world Of splended wrecks, formless and numberless, Broke on my vision. It did seem the skies Were o'er me pure as fancy—yet waves Did rattle round my head, and fill mine ears Like the measureless roar of the far fight When battle has set up her trumpet shout! I seem'd to breathe the air; and yet the sea Kept dallying with my life as I sunk down. 'T was in the fitful fashion of a dream— Water and air—walking, and yet no earth. The deep seem'd bare and dry—and yet I went With a rude dashing round my reeking face, Until my outstretched and trembling feet Stood still upon a bed of glittering pearls! The hot sun was right over me, at noon— Sudden it wither'd up the ocean—till I seem'd amidst a waste of shapeless clay. A thousand bones were whitening in his rays, Mass upon mass,—confused and without end. I walk'd on the parch'd wilderness, and saw The hopeless beauty of a lifeless world! Wealth that once made some poor vain heart grow lig And leap with it into the flood, was there Clutch'd in the last mad agony. And gold, That makes of life a happiness and curse— That vaunts on earth its brilliancy, lay here— An outcast tyrant in his loneliness— Beggar'd by jewels that ne'er shone through blood Upon the brow of kings! Here there were all The bright beginnings and the costly ends, Which envied man enjoys and expiates,— Splendor, and death—silence, and human hopes— Gems, and smooth bones—life's pageantry! the cross That thought to save some wretch in his late need Hugg'd in its last idolatry—all, all Lay here in deathly brotherhood—no breath— No sympathy—no sound—no motion—and no hope I stood and listen'd,— The eternal flood rush'd to its desolate grave! And I could hear above me all the waves Go bellowing to their bounds! Still I strode on, Journeying amid the brightest of earth's things Where yet was never life, nor hope, nor joy! My eye could not but look, and my ear hear; For now strange sights, and beautiful, and rare, Seem'd order'd from the deep through the rich prism Above me—and sounds undulated through The surges, till my soul grew mad with visions! Beneath the canopy of waters I could see Palaces and cities crumbled—and the ships Sunk in the engorging whirlpool, while the laugh Of revelry went wild along their decks, and ere The oath was strangled in their swollen throats;— For there they lay, just hurried to one grave With horrible contortions and fix'd eyes Waving among the cannon, as the surge Would slowly lift them—and their streaming hair Twining around the blades that were their pride. And there were two lock'd in each other's arms, And they were lovers! Oh God, how beautiful! cheek to cheek And heart to heart upon that splendid deep, A bridal bed of pearls!—a burial Worthy of two so young and innocent. And they did seem to lie there, like two gems The fairest in the halls of ocean—both Sepulchred in love—a tearless death—one look, One wish, one smile, one mantle for their shroud, One hope, one kiss—and that not yet quite cold! How beautiful to die in such fidelity! E'er yet the curse has ripen'd, or the heart Begins to hope for death as for a joy, And feels its streams grow thicker, till they cloy With wishes that have sicken'd and grown old. I saw their cheeks were pure and passionless, And all their love had pass'd into a smile, And in that smile they died! Sudden a battle roll'd above my head, And there came down a flash into the deep Illumining its dim chambers—and it pass'd; The waters shudder'd—and a thousand sounds Sung hellish echoes through the cavern'd waste. The blast was screaming on the upper wave, And as I look'd above me I could see The ships go booming through the murky storm, Sails rent—masts staggering—and a spectre crew,— Blood mingled with the foam bathing their bows,— And I could hear their shrieks as they went on Crying of murder to their bloody foes! A form shot downward close at my feet; His hand still grasp'd the steel—and his red eye Was full of curses even in his death;— For he had been flung into the abyss By fellow men before his heart was cold! Again I stood beside the lovely pair;— The storm and conflict were as they 'd not been. I stood and shriek'd and laugh'd, and yet no voice, That I could hear, came in my madness; It hardly seem'd that they were dead—so calm, So beautiful! the sea-stars round them shone, Like emblems of their souls so cold and pure! The bending grass wept silent over them, Truer than any friend on earth—their tomb The jewelry of the ocean, and their dirge The everlasting music of its roar. I seem'd to stand wretched in dreamy thought, Cursing the constancy of human hearts And vanity of human hopes—and felt As I have felt on earth in my sick hours;— How thankless was this legacy of breath To those who knew the wo of a scathed brain! Oh ocean—ocean! if thou coverest up The ruins of a proud and broken soul, And givest such peace and solitude as this, Thy depths are heaven to man's ingratitude I seem'd to struggle in an agony; My streaming tears gush'd out to meet the wave; I woke in terror, and the beaded sweat Coursed down my temples like a very rain, As though I had just issued from the sea! MOUNT WASHINGTON. Mount of the clouds; on whose Olympian height The tall rocks brighten in the ether air, And spirits from the skies come down at night, To chant immortal songs to Freedom there! Thine is the rock of other regions; where The world of life which blooms so far below Sweeps a wide waste: no gladdening scenes appear, Save where with silvery flash the waters flow Beneath the far off mountain, distant, calm, and slow. Thine is the summit where the clouds repose, Or eddying wildly round thy cliffs are borne; When Tempest mounts his rushing car, and throws His billowy mist amid the thunder's home! Far down the deep ravines the whirlwinds come, And bow the forest as they sweep along; While roaring deeply from their rocky womb The storms come forth—and hurrying darkly on, Amid the echoing peaks the revelry prolong! And when the tumult of the air is fled, And quench'd in silence all the tempest flame, There come the dim forms of the mighty dead, Around the steep which bears the hero's name. The stars look down upon them—and the same Pale orb that glistens o'er his distant grave, Gleams on the summit that enshrines his fame, And lights the cold tear of the glorious brave— The richest, purest tear, that memory ever gave! Mount of the clouds! when winter round thee throws The hoary mantle of the dying year, Sublime amid the canopy of snows, Thy towers in bright magnificence appear! 'T is then we view thee with a chilling fear, Till summer robes thee in her tints of blue; When lo! in soften'd grandeur, far, yet clear, Thy battlements stand clothed in heaven's own hue, To swell as Freedom's home on man's unbounded view! THE AIR VOYAGE. A VISION. Ye have heard of spirits that sail the air, Like birds that float over the mountains bare— Upborne with pinions of beauty on, When the farewell light of day is gone, And they gladly soar to the blue away, As to catch the star's young travelling ray Till the arch of night, Is tremblingly bright, As if meteors shot on their upward flight. Ye have heard of spirits that sail away To realms that glitter with endless day— Where the clouds scarce lift their giant forms In their far, dim march to the land of storms; Where the ocean of ether heaves around, And silence and dew alone are found! Where life is still, By a boundless will, As a sabbath around some echoless hill! Methought I was borne through the measureless fields, Where the silver moon and the comet wheels. With a glorious thrilling of joy I went, And a tide of life through my heart was sent, As though a new fountain had burst control, And bade its streams o'er my pulses roll; And a shallop frail, With a shadowy sail, Hurried me on with the singing gale. It went through my brain, this deep delight, With a kindling sense of sound and sight; And it seem'd, as I rose, that the far blue air Caught a hue of glory more richly rare, Than was ever reveal'd to earthly eyes— The cold, cold lustre of uppermost skies! And still my bark went Through the firmament, As a thing to the walls of the universe sent. When the sun roll'd up from the burning sea, Like a car of flame from immensity, I felt his beams quiver along my frame, When first o'er the clouds and stars they came; And the light-dropping orbs I had slumber'd among, Their dim, dewy eyes o'er creation hung. As each beautiful ray Sunk sadly away, To the inner home of the high blue day! Then I sailed far off to the thundering clouds, That loomed on the air like spirits in shrouds, My vessel, sunk on their fleecy pillow, Seem'd a shadowy bark on a dreamy billow; And I floated through seas of vision'd things, Where the waking breezes point their wings, While far below, 'Mid the lightning's glow, I heard the dull sounds of the tempest go. Then storm-clouds crossed my glowing track, And launch'd me on through the hurrying rack, Till a new creation seem'd to rise In beauty all over the opening skies; And the spirits that pass'd on the wings of night, As they took their farewell feathery flight, Pour'd melody out Like the far-off shout Of music that dies on its airy route! CHARLES J. LOCKE A DREAM OF THE OCEAN. A mermaid uprose in a golden dream, And cried, “come, follow me”— We glided away, on a swift moon-beam To the brighest cave of the sea. 'T was the festal hall of the waves, and there Bright gems were cluster'd round; And glowing shells in the liquid air Made melody of sound. I danced with the spirits o'er diamond sands And quaff'd of happiness; And wore a robe which their fairy hands Had twined of light and bliss. I linger'd in ecstacy 'mid the grove Of corals glancing bright, And heard the pure song of the Mermaid's love For a star in fields of light. The water-sprites gather'd around to hear The song that seem'd to wail With the harmony soft, of the shell-tones clear, And the surface-sighing gale. “Oh! come” sung the mermaid, “thou beauteous star, Come o'er the distant sea; The bright moon has vanish'd and sail'd afar, And thou may'st come to me. Oh! I have watch'd on the cold, cold rock, And rode the ocean foam, And laugh'd at the lightning and thunder-shock As they crush'd my sparry home; And have wish'd I could catch on the lightning-lance And guide it back to thee, For the moon-beam wearies and falls askance Far e'er it gains thy sea. I built me a grotto of tinted shells All glean'd from ocean's shores, And sat there uttering fondest spells 'Mid howling tempest's roars; And I hoped thou would'st come—but I hope not now For coldly thou didst smile, And I gather'd some nightshade to bind my brow, And my heart was sad the while. Yet I love, pretty star, on the rock to sing And twine in wreaths thy gleam”— The moon sank down, the dark spread his wing, And I woke from this lovely dream. THE HARP OF THE BATTLE. Strike the harp! strike the harp! let the soft-toned lute Be still in these halls tonight; Its mellowing cadence shall now be mute;— And cease to breathe on that silvery flute;— It gives me no more delight; For my soul is mad with ambition and care, And I cannot list to a plaintive air. Strike the harp! strike the harp! let its swelling tones Rise full on the midnight damp; Strike the rage of the battle, the dying moans, That mingle so wild with the frighten'd groans And shrieks of a slaughtering camp, And sound me the guns and the clash of arms And all the fierce horrors of war's alarms. I hear it—I see it—the warriors in strife Are thick in the struggling fight; And madly they rush to the field where life Is thrown to the wind, but where glory is rife On its smoke and its bloody light. And he with the white plume is snatching the wreath From the blackening brow of his foe in death. See, he flies to the onset; again and again;— Hark! his shout o'er the fallen foe, Oh! God, he has shouted, and fought in vain, For, stretch'd by a mightier hand on the plain He lies in his life-blood low;— His friends quail around him—“ye dastards fly not, But give me the brand that his hand has forgot.” “Fly not, ye base cowards, come quick to the fight,” They turn to the battle again. “Now strike home for vengeance—spare not in your might The faithless invaders”—they 're routed in flight— The red earth is strown with the slain— List, list to the shrieking—'t is fainter—all 's o'er— The harp-tone hath ceased and the battle 's no more THE QUEEN OF THE MIST. Beautiful Spirit! that glidest away, Light o'er the mountain, I pray thee stay! Stay but a moment, for I would know, Whence thou hast come, and whither dost go! Beautiful Spirit! bound by my spell! Oh! tell, oh! tell, Murmuring echo, too, bids thee tell. Why didst thou sail o'er the calm blue lake All the dark night, and at morning take Gently thy shadowy robes and fly Softly away to the glowing sky?— Sometimes I fancy thee bride of the Sun; The Sun, the Sun, Yes, echo calls thee the bride of the Sun. Flowerets are weeping, because thou art cold, While in thy presence they sweetly fold Closer their beauties, so blooming bright, Striving to keep thee, thou child of light:— When thou art vanish'd they dry their tears, Their tears, their tears, Echo repeats it, they dry their tears. Oh! for a bride that would haste to me, Lovely as thou art—in ecstacy— Melting away in each fond embrace.— Now thou hast vanish'd, nor left a trace, Faintly to answer my broken spell;— Farewell, farewell, Murmuring echo, now bids farewell. FREDERIC MELLEN SABBATH EVENING. List! there is music in the air: It is the sabbath evening bell, Chiming the vesper hour of prayer, O'er the mountain top and lowland dell. And infancy and age are seen, Slow winding o'er the church-yard green. It is the eve of rest; the light Still lingers on the moss-grown tower, While to the drowsy ear of night, Slowly it marks the evening hour. 'T is hush'd! and all is silent there, Save the low, fervent voice of prayer. And now far down the quiet vale, Sweet hymnings on the air float by; Hushing the whip-poor-will's sad wail With its own plaintive melody. They breathe of peace, like the sweet strains That swept at night o'er Bethlehem's plains. And heads are bow'd, as the low hymn Steals through that gray and time-worn pile; And the altar lights burn faint and dim, In the long and moss-grown aisle. And the distant foot-fall echoes loud, Above that hush'd and kneeling crowd. And now beneath the old elm's shade, Where the cold moon-beams may not smile; Bright flowers upon the graves are laid, And sad tears shed unseen the while. The last sweet gift affection brings, To deck the earth to which it clings. How beautiful those simple flowers Strown o'er that silent spot still sleep; Still wet with summer's gentle showers, As if they too could feel and weep! They fade and die; the wintry wind Shall leave no trace of them behind! The bright new moon hath set: the light Is fading on the far blue hills; And on the passing breeze of night, The music of their thousand rills Comes echoing through the twilight gray, With the lone watch-dog's distant bay. The crowd hath pass'd away; the prayer And low breathed evening hymn are gone; The cold mist only lingers there, O'er the dark moss and mouldering stone. And the stars shine brightly o'er the glen, Where rest the quiet homes of men. THE HERDSMAN'S GRAVE. He sleeps beneath the larch tree's shade; And kindly hands his cairn have made Far up among the sunny hills, Beside his own pure mountain rills; Whose music, when the summer day From the deep glens had pass'd away, And from the far down village tower The bell toll'd out the evening hour, Would murmur round his moss-wreathed bed, Its simple requiem o'er the dead. It is a lonely grave—and here, When the still summer eve draws near, The eagle folds his dusky wing, To list the storm's deep muttering Far down among the mountain vales; While o'er that verdant spot, the gales Of evening stir the dark old pines; And o'er the cloud's embattled lines, The sun pours forth his last bright smile, As if to bless that mouldering pile. Long years have sped upon their flight, And many a dark and weary night, The cold rain-drops, with sullen dash, Have swept the larch and mountain ash, Since the first flow'rets bloom'd around, The margin of that little mound. It was a summer day—the bells, From the deep mountain gorge and dells, Were chiming on the morning breeze; And 'neath the dark o'erhanging trees, The muleteer sung on his way Chanting his blithesome roundelay. No tears were shed—no mutter'd prayer Stole upward through the stilly air; No flowers were strown—the mountain stream Murmur'd his only requiem! But when his native hills are bright In the calm smile of summer's light; And all the lowland woods are green, By that lone grave sweet flowers are seen; And travellers pause upon their way, To list the birds' sad minstrelsy From that old larch, and breathe a prayer, For him who rests in silence there. WILLIAM B. O. PEABODY HYMN OF NATURE. God of the earth's extended plains! The dark green fields contented lie: The mountains rise like holy towers, Where man might commune with the sky: The tall cliff challenges the storm That lowers upon the vale below, Where shaded fountains send their streams, With joyous music in their flow. God of the dark and heavy deep! The waves lie sleeping on the sands, Till the fierce trumpet of the storm Hath summon'd up their thundering bands; Then the white sails are dash'd like foam, Or hurry trembling, o'er the seas, Till calm'd by thee, the sinking gale Serenely breathes, “Depart in peace.’ God of the forest's solemn shade! The grandeur of the lonely tree, That wrestles singly with the gale, Lifts up admiring eyes to thee; But more majestic far they stand, When side by side, their ranks they form, To wave on high their plumes of green, And fight their battles with the storm. God of the light and viewless air! Where summer breezes sweetly flow, Or, gathering in their angry might, The fierce and wintry tempests blow; All—from the evening's plaintive sigh, That hardly lifts the drooping flower, To the wild whirlwind's midnight cry— Breathes forth the language of thy power. God of the fair and open sky! How gloriously above us springs The tented dome, of heavenly blue, Suspended on the rainbow's wings; Each brilliant star, that sparkles through Each gilded cloud, that wanders free In evening's purple radiance, gives The beauty of its praise to thee. God of the rolling orbs above! Thy name is written clearly bright In the warm day's unvarying blaze, Or evening's golden shower of light. For every fire that fronts the sun, And every spark that walks alone Around the utmost verge of heaven, Were kindled at thy burning throne. God of the world! thy hour must come, And nature's self to dust return! Her crumbling altars must decay! Her incense fires shall cease to burn! But still her grand and lovely scenes Have made man's warmest praises flow; For hearts grow holier as they trace The beauty of the world below. ON SEEING A DECEASED INFANT. And this is death! how cold and still, And yet how lovely it appears! Too cold to let the gazer smile, But far too beautiful for tears. The sparkling eye no more is bright, The cheek hath lost its rose-like red; And yet it is with strange delight I stand and gaze upon the dead. But when I see the fair wide brow, Half shaded by the silken hair, That never look'd so fair as now, When life and health were laughing there I wonder not that grief should swell So wildly upward in the breast, And that strong passion once rebel That need not, cannot be suppress'd. I wonder not that parents' eyes In gazing thus grow cold and dim, That burning tears and aching sighs Are blended with the funeral hymn; The spirit hath an earthly part, That weeps when earthly pleasure flies, And heaven would scorn the frozen heart That melts not when the infant dies. And yet why mourn? that deep repose Shall never more be broke by pain; Those lips no more in sighs unclose, Those eyes shall never weep again. For think not that the blushing flower Shall wither in the church-yard sod, 'T was made to gild an angel's bower Within the paradise of God. Once more I gaze—and swift and far The clouds of death in sorrow fly, I see thee like a new-born star Move up thy pathway in the sky: The star hath rays serene and bright, But cold and pale compared with thine; For thy orb shines with heavenly light, With beams unfailing and divine. Then let the burthen'd heart be free, The tears of sorrow all be shed, And parents calmly bend to see The mournful beauty of the dead; Thrice happy—that their infant bears To heaven no darkening stains of sin; And only breathed life's morning airs Before its evening storms begin. Farewell! I shall not soon forget! Although thy heart hath ceased to beat, My memory warmly treasures yet Thy features calm and mildly sweet; But no, that look is not the last, We yet may meet where seraphs dwell, Where love no more deplores the past, Nor breathes that withering word—farewell. T. W. STONE. THE BAY OF NAPLES. See how the peaceful ripple breaks In calmness on the verdant shore, While zephyr, gently breathing, wakes The slumbering spirit of each flower, Which glows in beauteous brilliancy, Along the margin of the tide, And oft arrests the wandering eye, As o'er the waves we gently glide. Let us unfold the swelling sail, Beneath the silent, silvery moon; And catch the softly murmuring gale, Which breathes in midnight's solemn noon. And thou, my friend, shalt guide us now Along the bosom of the bay, While seated on the lofty prow, We mark the ripple, that our way Leaves on the waters, like the streak Of morning, on an Alpine height, When Sol's first radiant daybeams break, In all the glow of infant light. What sounds resound along the shores! What echoes wake from off the seas! While music from Italian bowers Comes mingled with the evening breeze; The careless sailor floats along, Slow wafted by the ebbing flood, And swells the chorus of the song, Which joyous peals from hill and wood. And laughing bands of youth are there, Who deftly dance to lightest measure, And sea, and shore, and earth, and air, Resound to mellow notes of pleasure. But, ah! 't is past; a deeper brown Has tinged the foliage of the wood, Vesuvius' mighty shadows frown Majestically o'er the flood; The moon has set, and shadowy sleep Now holds dominion o'er mankind, Binding in slumber's vision deep, The force of thought and power of mind. In shadowy grandeur, now appears The genius of the olden time, And marks the ravages of years In her once highly favor'd clime; Sad on the ruins of the past Dark melancholy broods alone; Marking the wreck of temples vast, The ruin'd shrine and altar stone. Fair land! where oft, in days of yore, The hymns of liberty were sung; Thy boasted empire 's now no more, Thy lyre of freedom all unstrung. But, still the spirit loves to tread Where sleep the great of ages ended, For, musing on thy mighty dead, They seem with all thy scenery blended. They seem to whisper in thy trees, They seem to flit along thy mountains, They seem to float in evening's breeze, They seem to haunt thy limpid fountains. I. M'LELLAN THE PRIDE OF THE VILLAGE. This grassy hillock, with its rustic urn, And its light hedge of snowy roses, train'd By some sweet hand, is the abiding place Of one most beautiful. A sweeter child Than this frail tenant of the churchyard cell, You would not meet through all the village round. She perish'd in the heyday of her life, Ere yet the frosts of trouble or of care Had chill'd the gentle freshness of her youth. She was of all the rural feasts the queen— The merriest when the dance wheel'd round the tree At summer eventide, or when it swept The hearth-stone of the jocund husbandman, In winter's chilly and tempestuous night. Oh! there is not a happy bird that fills The open valley with her sylvan song, When night is darkening all the golden woods, That might surpass the compass of her voice In its deep, delicate richness! In the grave She sleepeth now, where everything is mute! Long shall the poor man, and the aged dame, And orphan child, remember her sweet smile And her benignant acts; for well she loved To minister unto the broken heart, And help the poor blind beggar on his way, And succor him with travel sore athirst, And shelter, from the rain and wintry hail, The man that had not where to lay his head; And ever there the grateful traveller bless'd That sweet, young face, that smiled his gloom away, And woke the song of gladness in his heart. And here her lover rests! Beneath yon ridge, Whereon the weeds grow rank, is hid the dust, The plume, the bloody sword, the spur, and scarf Of one who fought for fame, and found it not. He was a wild and reckless, wayward boy, The leader of the noisy village troop In all their careless sports—one stout of heart And strong of hand, and foremost in the rush Of boyish battle. Yet his fiery soul Would melt when Sorrow told her wretched tale, Or Pain the gloomy history of her grief, Or Age her melancholy words. The youth Had pledged his honest love to that meek girl, And in the innocent fondness of her heart, She bless'd him with her love. But time wore on, And he had heard the savage trump of war Sound in the peaceful vale, and heard the tramp And neighing of the charger, and the clang Of martial arms, and shouts of armed men, And saw the gairish flag of battle float Beside the cottage of his infancy. He clothed him in the garb of strife, and placed Its sword upon his thigh, and search'd for fame “E'en at the cannon's mouth.” And he came back A bruised, and sick, and broken-hearted man, To linger out his few sad days on earth And die, and be at rest;—and by his side They placed that bruised reed that leant on him. “After life's fitful fever he sleeps well.” J. B. VAN SCHAICK JOSHUA COMMANDING THE SUN AND MOON TO STAND STILL. The day rose clear on Gibeon. Her high towers Flash'd the red sunbeams gloriously back, And the wind-driven banners, and the steel Of her ten thousand spears caught dazzlingly The sun, and on the fortresses of rock Play'd a soft glow, that as a mockery seem'd To the stern men who girded by its light. Beth-Horon in the distance slept, and breath Was pleasant in the vale of Ajalon, Where armed heels trod carelessly the sweet Wild spices, and the trees of gum were shook By the rude armor on their branches hung. Suddenly in the camp without the walls Rose a deep murmur, and the men of war Gather'd around their kings, and “Joshua! From Gilgal, Joshua!” was whisper'd low, As with a secret fear, and then, at once, With the abruptness of a dream, he stood Upon the rock before them. Calmly then Raised he his helm, and with his temples bare And hands uplifted to the sky, he pray'd;— “God of this people, hear! and let the sun Stand upon Gibeon, still; and let the moon Rest in the vale of Ajalon!” He ceased— And lo! the moon sits motionless, and earth Stands on her axis indolent. The sun Pours the unmoving column of his rays In undiminish'd heat; the hours stand still; The shade hath stopp'd upon the dial's face; The clouds and vapors that at night are wont To gather and enshroud the lower earth, Are struggling with strange rays, breaking them up, Scattering the misty phalanx like a wand, Glancing o'er mountain tops, and shining down In broken masses on the astonish'd plains. The fever'd cattle group in wondering herds; The weary birds go to their leafy nests, But find no darkness there, and wander forth On feeble, fluttering wing, to find a rest; The parch'd, baked earth, undamp'd by usual dews, Has gaped and crack'd, and heat, dry, mid-day heat, Comes like a drunkard's breath upon the heart. On with thy armies, Joshua! The Lord God of Sabaoth is the avenger now! His voice is in the thunder, and his wrath Poureth the beams of the retarded sun, With the keen strength of arrows, on their sight. The unwearied sun rides in the zenith sky; Nature, obedient to her Maker's voice, Stops in full course all her mysterious wheels. On! till avenging swords have drunk the blood Of all Jehovah's enemies, and till Thy banners in returning triumph wave; Then yonder orb shall set 'mid golden clouds, And, while a dewy rain falls soft on earth, Show in the heavens the glorious bow of God, Shining, the rainbow banner of the skies. JOHN W. WHITMAN THE JERSEY PRISON SHIP. They died—the young—the loved, the brave, The death barge came for them. And where the seas yon crag rocks lave Their nightly requiem, They buried them all, and threw the sand Unhallow'dly o'er that patriot band. The black ship, like a demon sate, Upon the prowling deep; From her, came fearful sounds of hate, Till pain still'd all in sleep— It was the sleep that victims take, Tied, tortured, dying, at the stake. Yet some, the deep has now updug, Their bones are in the sun; And whether by sword, or deadly drug, They died—yes—one by one. Was it not strange to mortal eye, To see them all so strangely die? No death upon the field was theirs, No war-peal o'er their graves, They who were born as Freedom's heirs, Were stabb'd like traitor slaves. Their patriot hearts were doom'd to feel Dishonor—with the victor's steel. There come upon the stilly eve, Wild songs from yon wild shore; And then the surges more wildly heave Their hoarse and growling roar, When dead men sing unearthly glees, And shout in laughing revelries. The corpse-light shines, like some pale star, From out the dead men's cliff; And the sea nymphs sail in their coral car, With those that are cold and stiff. And they sail near the spot of treachery, where The tide has left the dark ship bare. Are they those ancient ones, who died For freedom, and for me? They are—they point in martyr'd pride, To that spot upon the sea, From whence came once the dying yell, From out that wreck—that prison'd hell. Hark! hear their chant—it starts the hair It makes the blood turn cold; 'T would make the tiger forsake his lair, The miser leave his gold. And see yon harper! he doth try A dead man's note of melody. CHANT. Soundly sleep we in the day, And yet we trip it nightly, We sail with the nymphs around each bay, When the moon peers out most brightly. And we chase our foes to their distant graves, For they, like us, are sleeping; But they dare not come o'er our bonny waves, For our nightly watch we 're keeping. Our spectres visit their foreign homes, And pluck right merrily Their bones which whiten within their tombs, And plant them here, aye, cheerily,— For cheerily then we dance and sing, With our spectre band around them, And the curse and the laugh of scorn we fling, As we tell where our shadows found them. And then we go to the rotting wreck, Where we drank the cup of poison, We laugh and we quaff upon her deck, Till morn comes up the horizon. But skip ye, skip ye, beneath the cliff, For the sun comes up like a fiery skiff, Ploughing the waves of yon blue sky— Hie—laughing spectres, to your homes, haste—hie. JOSEPH H. NICHOLS BENNETT'S BRIDGE. This is a wild and picturesque pass of the Housatonic, about twenty miles from its mouth, near the pleasant village of Newtown, Connecticut. Thou beautiful, romantic Dell! Thy banks of hemlock highlands swell, Like huge sea billows, o'er the isles Round which the branching river smiles. Look up! how sombre and how vast The shadows those dark mountains cast, Making noon twilight; or, look down The giddy depths, so steep and brown, Where claret waters foam and play A tinkling tune, then dance away. Oft, with my oak leaf basket green, On summer holidays serene, Along your hill-sides have I stray'd, And, on the ground, all scarlet made, Pick'd in full stems, as low I kneel'd, Strawberries, rubies of the field, Coming late home; or, in the flood, Cool'd the warm current of my blood; While swam the house-dog after me, With long red tongue lapt out in glee. 'T is glorious, here, at breaking day, To watch the orient clouds of gray Blush crimson, as the yellow sun Walks up to take his purple throne, And melts to snowy mists the dew That kiss'd, all night, each blossom's hue, Till, like a tumbling ocean spread, They hide low vale and tall cliff's head, And many a tree's fantastic form Looks like some toss'd ship in a storm. How still the scene! yet, here war's hum Once echoed wildly from the drum, When waved the lily flower's gay bloom O'er glittering troops with sword and plume, Who, on the clover meadows round, Their white tents pitch'd, while music's sound, From horn and cymbal, play'd some strain That oft had charm'd the banks of Seine, And village girls came down to dance, At evening with the youths of France. Fair was the hour, secluded Dell! When last I taught my listening shell Sweet notes of thee. The bright moon shone, As, on the shore, I mused alone, And frosted rocks, and streams, and tree, With rays that beam'd, like eyes, on me. A silver robe the mountains hung, A silver song the waters sung, And many a pine was heard to quiver, Along my own blue flowing river. THE FALLS OF THE HOUSATONICK. Wild cataract of woods! how bright Thy sheet of liquid silver gleams, Through the green cedars, on my sight, Like a tall angel's spear in dreams. And see the snowy wreath of spray, Meet for a spotless virgin's shroud, Curl up the clear blue vault away To form the future tempest-cloud. Through mountain shores, with red and gold Leaves, at this autumn hour, array'd, Winds the swift river, dark and bold, O'er rocks in many a white cascade. Till sweeping past, 'mid froth and surge, The alder islets strown around, To where the willows kiss thy verge, Thou dashest off at one wild bound! Here, as we gaze—I and my friend, Two youths with roses on our cheeks, 'T is sweet, but awful, thus to bend Over the wonder, as it speaks Like a young earthquake, and to feel A nameless grandeur swell the soul With joy that makes the senses reel, Half-wishing in the flood to roll! Yes, thou art fair, and fain would I, Were mine no love, no kindred true, Alone here live, alone here die, Were I but worthy too for you, For oh! were mortals half so fair And beautiful as their abodes, Woman a cherub's face would wear, And man—the majesty of gods. Each morning sun a rainbow builds Of pink, across thy diamond foam, That every tossing billow gilds With pearls, to deck its ocean home. Too soon it fades, unseen by all, Save the rude woodman of the hill, Or, when for water to the fall, Trips the glad damsel of the mill. Methinks, at winter's dazzling night, Thine were a lovelier scene than now, For then the very air is white With the pure stars and purer snow. And trees, like crystal chandeliers, In nature's blue cathedral arch, Light by the moon their gems of tears, Where, like a queen bride, thou dost march. And, oft, with a peculiar awe, Thou com'st the moss-green rocks to lash: When the soft vernal breezes thaw The long chain'd river, at one crash Of thunder, it breaks up and roars, Till echoing caverns wake from sleep, As at a mammoth's voice,—and pours An ice-piled deluge down thy steep. Fall of the forest! on a wild Romantic pilgrimage I come To see thy face, for, from a child, My footsteps ever loved to roam Places untrod—yet, why hast thou, In sylvan beauty, roll'd so long, And not a poet's tongue, ere now, Has told his lyre thy praise in song. JAMES O. ROCKWELL TO THE ICE MOUNTAIN. Grave of waters gone to rest! Jewel, dazzling all the main! Father of the silver crest! Wandering on the trackless plain, Sleeping 'mid the wavy roar, Sailing 'mid the angry storm, Ploughing ocean's oozy floor, Piling to the clouds thy form! Wandering monument of rain, Prison'd by the sullen north! But to melt thy hated chain, Is it, that thou comest forth? Wend thee to the sunny south, To the glassy summer sea, And the breathings of her mouth Shall unchain and gladden thee! Roamer in the hidden path, 'Neath the green and clouded wave! Trampling, in thy reckless wrath, On the lost, but cherish'd brave; Parting love's death-link'd embrace— Crushing beauty's skeleton— Tell us what the hidden race With our mourned lost have done! Floating Sleep! who in the sun Art an icy coronal; And, beneath the viewless dun, Throw'st o'er barks a wavy pall; Shining Death upon the sea! Wend thee to the southern main; Bend to God thy melting knee, Mingle with the wave again! MILTON WARD. THE LYRE. There was a Lyre, 'tis said, that hung High waving in the summer air; An angel hand its chord had strung, And left to breathe its music there. Each wandering breeze, that o'er it flew, Awoke a wilder, sweeter strain, Than ever shell of Mermaid blew In coral grottoes of the main. When, springing from the rose's bell, Where all night he had sweetly slept, The zephyr left the flowery dell Bright with the tears, that morning wept, He rose, and o'er the trembling lyre, Waved lightly his soft azure wing; What touch such music could inspire! What harp such lays of joy could sing! The murmurs of the shaded rills, The birds, that sweetly warbled by, And the soft echo from the hills, Were heard not where that harp was nigh. When the last light of fading day Along the bosom of the west, In colors softly mingled lay, While night had darken'd all the rest, Then, softer than that fading light, And sweeter than the lay, that rung Wild through the silence of the night, As solemn Philomela sung, That harp its plaintive murmurs sigh'd Along the dewy breeze of even; So clear and soft they swell'd and died, They seem'd the echoed songs of heaven. Sometimes, when all the air was still, And not the poplar's foliage trembled, That harp was nightly heard to thrill With tones, no earthly tones resembled. And then, upon the moon's pale beams, Unearthly forms were seen to stray, Whose starry pinions' trembling gleams Would oft around the wild harp play. But soon the bloom of summer fled— In earth and air it shone no more; Each flower and leaf fell pale and dead, While skies their wintry sternness wore. One day, loud blew the northern blast— The tempest's fury raged along— Oh! for some angel, as they pass'd, To shield the harp of heavenly song! It shriek'd—how could it bear the touch, The cold rude touch of such a storm, When e'en the zephyr seem'd too much Sometimes, though always light and warm. It loudly shriek'd—but ah! in vain— The savage wind more fiercely blew; Once more—it never shriek'd again, For every chord was torn in two. It never thrill'd with anguish more, Though beaten by the wildest blast; The pang, that thus its bosom tore, Was dreadful—but it was the last. And though the smiles of summer play'd Gently upon its shatter'd form, And the light zephyrs o'er it stray'd, That lyre they could not wake or warm. GEORGE LUNT THE GRAVE OF BYRON. I knew young Julian well;—that gentle youth, Whose heart was as a maiden's;—by my side He grew together with me, and in truth His boyish sports were mine, whether we plied The evening smoothness of the summer tide, Or met the sunbeam on the mountain's brow; I loved him well;—alas, for me! he died, When the first Autumn winds began to blow Foliage whose bright tints mock'd the soft-hued sunset glow. He was indeed a strange and dreamy boy, Wild as an Indian huntress, and as proud As his young country's eagles; and his joy Was even like theirs to listen to the loud Clang of the tempest or the rattling cloud; Yet loved all human kind, he was so mild: What here is writ he gave me ere he bow'd His head upon my bosom, as he smiled His lingering life away, most like a slumbering child. Free as the untamed thunder-levin rolling Athwart the blackness of this drooping sky;— Free as the winds controll'd not, yet controlling, Free as the martyr's last prayer when to die Is glorious gain;—free as despair's deep sigh, Or as the waters when their chainless surge, Lash'd to wild wrath, speaks to the storm on high, Rise up, my soul, while proud hopes onward urge, And perish in the whelming tempest, or emerge To high and perilous emprise;—throw off The bondage of all such as war with thought, And trample on the fool's unmeaning scoff; Why should'st thou bow to wealth, who art unbought? What carest thou for forms, who art untaught To smile when thou should'st frown?—thou wilt not sell The holy birthright of thy race for aught;— Rise, then, my slumbering spirit, rise and dwell Enshrined in quenchless thought, fearless of earth or hell. The idols of my heart are fading fast, And my own fragile being will not long Endure the fatal memory of the past, Still less the gathering ills of present wrong, And unforgetful sighs, a tireless throng, Which day by day sink deeper than before;— Weak sighs, which still are mightier than the strong, Soon—soon—oh, when shall the vain strife be o'er, And I repose in peace, and ye torment no more? Yet will I hush this voice of weak lament;— Yet will I conquer this unmanly grief;— But the strong pain of passion first must vent Its throbbing woes in words for sad relief: 'T is done,—my waning pilgrimage be brief,— Though young and dying, scarcely can I mourn;— Time cannot bind my feelings' shatter'd sheaf, Nor bid the loved, the long, long lost return,— Then welcome be my journey towards the perilous bourne. Methinks it scarcely matters when we tread The road which all must tread who have not trod, Though the dark journey be replete with dread;— Firm by the mercy of a pitying God, And humbled at the chastening of his rod, How sweet, this aching heart and painful head Slumbering in peace beneath the grass-green sod, To join those ancient worthies who have fled, And meet the mightier spirits of the mighty dead! With them and such as them I have conversed More than with men, and thus the fruit has been That they and their old mouldering tomes have nursed Feelings and thoughts and hopes which do not win Men's charity, though haply not of sin: For Roman, Grecian lore has been to me The mistress of my love;—'mid cities' din I 've loved all Rome while yet she was the free, And wander'd, lost in mists, through sage Philosophy. Perchance it did not profit me;—at least, I learnt that knowledge doth not always bring The fabled pleasures of the mental feast;— That intellectual streams might own a spring Of bitter wave, whose sun-bright vapors fling An arch of promise o'er the cheating source, Lit by the ray of man's own hopes, which cling To all delusion with a desperate force, Till doubts and darkness soon obstruct their stumbling course. Perchance my draught was shallow, and confused The brain it did not sober—let it pass: Even from my childhood upward I have used To search into my being—but alas! The scrutiny was fruitless;—that I was Wretched I knew—but why I could not tell,— Born but to perish as a blade of grass;— One fate awaited all, I saw full well,— Alike the sage and fool—the vile and virtuous fell. For one grew ripe in honorable age, And others at his voice all lowly bow'd While he discoursed as from a pictured page Most eloquent music to a listening crowd, Who ever and anon fell shouting loud;— Till with a golden circlet (save this crown No other virtue had he,) terror-brow'd, Came one they call'd a king, and at his frown Blood from the old man's silvery locks went running down. Another fell in manhood's ripen'd day, In the full flow of his warm bosom's tide;— His wasted strength like weakness pass'd away, And his heart's lingering streams of life were dried By the enduring shame of humbled pride, Or rankling poison left by passion's sting, Or foul disease ungorged, and gaping wide;— For each hath plumed his shaft from Horror's wing, And each ten thousand shapes of varying fate can bring. And there was one who, by the kindling flush And happiness which beauty round her shed, Seem'd 'mid her pure hours, lit by that soft blush, Some stray grace tripping o'er a violet bed, In spring,—but ere the lingering aster fled, They laid her ringlets 'neath the early snow;— Men marvell'd that so fair a thing was dead, And when flowers blossom, blue-eyed maidens go, With memory's garland-gifts for her who sleeps below. And dreamy boys in the rathe bloom of youth, Ere frozen years had bid them cease to lave Their glowing cheeks with tears of joy or ruth, Went down in silence to the marble grave, Scorch'd by the flame of passions which they crave;— Or else embarking all their hope upon Some voyage of love;—and on the fickle wave Of that false sea perchance the worshipp'd one Made shipwreck of their hopes, and so they were undone. And some, dishearten'd at the world's cold frown And chilly aspect of its frozen eye, Weep like the clouds, until they seem to drown The life of their young ears, and sigh on sigh Exhausts their being's source, and so they lie Down in the loveliness of innocent youth And welcome the Deliverer, as they die Smiling for joy; yet do we feel, in sooth, How wild the loss to us—how dark the frantic truth. I know not if they sleep without the dreams Which grim delusion wraps around the core Of hearts which were not made to feel their streams Mix with unfathom'd lakes of guilty lore;— I know not if their pure souls upward soar, Or in the green earth's ample breast abide;— But he who wanders by the twilight shore When long slow curls climb up its silent side, May hear strange flitting notes die on the solemn tide. But when in quick wild wrath the wave of fears, Lash'd by careering winds from the fierce sleep Where heavily groaning late he lay, uprears The crested horror of his mountain heap;— Ah, then go stand by the tumultuous deep Alone, and if thou darest, try to cast Away the mortal dread which then shall creep Into thy soul, as on the shrieking blast Mad mirth and devilish shouts peal round thee loud and fast. Away, ye pleasant fancies;—let me now Recall my vision,—and methought I stood On a precipitous seashore's craggy brow;— It was at evening,—and the level flood Where the fledged younglings of the tempest brood Sported of late, lay fair and placid, save, As thoughts of their glad play would oft intrude, They now reposing in their azure cave, Sent pealing laughter upward on the curling wave. Fold after fold of that long line of water Unfurl'd its sullen length,—and like the stride Of a strong phalanx ripe for battle-slaughter, Came the firm slow march of the solemn tide Towards the broad beach, whose huge rocks, high and wide, Death-black as if the lightning of the thunder Had spent its wrath upon some mountain side, And half its monstrous bulk and riven asunder,— There smiled on time and chance a mockery and a wonder. Then as I stood by the bleak barren beach, And gazed upon its vast magnificence, While the proud waters vainly strove to reach The bulwark'd summit of that rocky fence,— Came on my soul some feelings so intense. Roused by the glory of that mighty swell, The exultation of my quivering sense Joy'd in the power of some o'ermastering spell, While from my unclosed lips these prompted accents fell: Thou who hast grovell'd 'mid the things accursed Which the world's dross hath spread about thy soul, And thou, whose wayward bosom hath been nursed 'Mid frantic doubts which scorn Heaven's just control,— Oh that ye heard with me the wondrous whole Of these majestic waves' tumultuous din; For standing where their starry summits roll, Some overwhelming feeling must rush in To blot for one blest moment each vile thought of sin. Oh that the monarchs of the world were here,— The demi-gods of fawning slaves who pour The heartless tribute of their guilty fear At the false shrines they hate while they adore;— For musing by this moralizing shore, Its beautifully grand array in sight, Methinks one little hour would teach them more How weakly faltering is their boasted height, Than philosophic texts preach'd on for ages might. O that the full-swoln monsters of the world,— The rich in groaning wretches' sighs, might stand, And see these glittering ocean treasures hurl'd In proud profusion towards the golden sand;— Might see the far deep, venerably bland, In silver hoary, and the lavish shore Mock the free offering of its wasteful hand,— Might feel some generous glow unfelt before, Or pious line sublime of gentle pity's lore. O that the trampled world's nobility, Proud of dull currents of degenerate blood, And boastful of the antique pedigree Which makes them worth contemptuous scorn, now stood Where the slow marching waters of the flood In solemn state majestic dash below,— Then might they see each of that graceful brood On the lone rock its destined being throw, Though old Eternity saw its ancestral flow. O thou illimitable ocean,—thou Shadowest the image of eternity;— Thy many-sparkling waves are wanton now Like reckless voyagers on that gloomy sea: Ten thousand of thy billows momently Ripple to being, then upon the shore Shrink back to death and nothingness,—so we Wake to the energies of life and pour Our few sad sighs,—one gasp,—and then are heard no more. MARY E. BROOKS ROMANCE. The warrior kneit before the maid— A blush came o'er her cheek; Telling, as o'er her brow it play'd, What not her tongue would speak. “Ah! yes,” he softly said, “thou 'lt be My own, my lily bride;” And still, in maiden purity, That maiden blush replied. Life, love, and hope were in their spring, Beneath a cloudless sky; The wild bird spread its silken wing, But breathed less melody. Young nectar from the myrtle bower The honey-bee might sip; The warrior found a sweeter flower In the dew of the maidens's lip. Still does the wild bird cleave the sky, The honey-bee is glad: Why dim with tears that maiden's eye, And why that warrior sad? “Maiden! dost fear to meet the storm That shades a soldier's way? The gems that deck the lordling's form— Dost sigh for such as they? “I woo thee not with glittering braid And jewels for thy hair— The golden gift that wins the maid An idle vow may bear.” Still does the wild bird cleave the sky, The honey-bee is glad; Why dim with tears that maiden eye, And why that warrior sad? “To horse! to horse! my melody Shall be the battle cry, And the war trump of victory As sweet as woman's sigh! “For fetter'd birds go free again, And love can dream of scorn; When woman idly weaves the chain, As idly be it worn.” Still does the wild bird cleave the sky, The honey bee is gay, But tears bedimm'd that maiden's eye As the warrior pass'd away. “They say there 's bliss in the princely train, And in a robe of pride; Then wake for me the bridal strain”— The maiden said and sigh'd. Loud laughter fills the banquet hall, There 's music in the grove, And steps as light as music's fall To catch the voice of love. She led the dance in merry glee, Her song was on the wind, And the red rose lay gracefully Within her hair reclined. But hark! the harper's minstrelsy— Of other days a part! She glanced upon the myrtle tree And icy felt her heart; And a shade was on the festal hour, The jewel lights grew dim; She only saw that myrtle bower, She only thought of him. “Oh! take me where the breezes swell, Far from the haunts of pride, For they say there 's joy where wild flowers dwell,”— The maiden said and sigh'd. The forest blossoms bound her brow, But the heart was cold below; And if she wakes the harp-strings now, What can they breathe but wo? “That dream—that dream—it comes again, Link'd with its broken vow; As beautiful, as frail, as then, They stand before me now! “Gather the young, the fair, the free, Where a thousand torches glare, With lyre and wreath and revelry— Still is that vision there! “It comes when summer skies are bright, On the laugh of the morning breeze— It comes when evening's misty light Has swept the sleeping seas”— An early rest in the sullen pall, One dream with the death pang wove— Oh! never of gems or of festal hall— But that first young dream of love! PSALM CXXXVII. Come sweep the harp! one thrilling rush Of all that warm'd its chords to song, And then the strains for ever hush, That oft have breathed its wires along: The ray is quench'd that lit our mirth, The shrine is gone that claim'd the prayer, And exiles o'er the distant earth, How can we wake the carol there? One sigh, my harp! and then to sleep, For all that loved thy song have flown, Why shouldst thou lonely vigils keep, Forsaken, broken, and alone? Let this sad murmur be thy last, Nor e'er again in music swell; Thine hours of joyousness are past, And thus we sever; fare thee well! GEORGE P. MORRIS WOMAN. Ah! woman—in this world of ours, What gift can be compared to thee? How slow would drag life's weary hours, Though man's proud brow were bound with flowers, And his the wealth of land and sea, If destined to exist alone, And ne'er call woman's heart his own. My mother!—at that holy name, Within my bosom there's a gush Of feeling, which no time can tame, A feeling which, for years of fame, I would not, could not crush. And sisters!—they are dear as life— But when I look upon my WIFE, My life-blood gives a sudden rush, And all my fond affections blend, In mother—sisters—wife—and friend. Yes, woman's love is free from guile, And pure as bright Aurora's ray— The heart will melt before its smile, And earthly passions fade away. Were I the monarch of the earth, And master of the swelling sea, I would not estimate their worth, Dear woman, half the price of thee. THE MINIATURE. William was holding in his hand The likeness of his wife: 'T was drawn by some enchanter's wand— It look'd—it smiled—like life! He almost thought it spoke—he gazed Upon the painting still, And was delighted and amazed To view the artist's skill. “This picture is thyself, sweet Jane,— 'T is drawn to nature true; I 've kiss'd it o'er and o'er again, It is so much like you!” “And has it kiss'd you back, my dear?” “Why—no, my love,” said he; “Then, William, it is very clear It 's not at all like me.” WHAT CAN IT MEAN? I'm much too young to marry, For I am only seventeen; Why think I then of Harry?— What can it mean—what can it mean? Whenever Harry meets me, Beside the brook, or on the green, How tenderly he greets me! What can it mean—what can it mean? Whene'er my name he utters, A blush upon my cheek is seen, And then my heart so flutters— What can it mean—what can it mean? And when he mentions Cupid, Or, smiling, calls me “fairy queen,” I sigh and look so stupid!— What can it mean—what can it mean? Oh, mercy! what can ail me? I'm growing pale and very lean; My spirits often fail me! What can it mean—what can it mean? I'm not in love!—oh smother Such a thought at seventeen: I'll go and ask my mother What it can mean—what it can mean. G. WALLINGFORD CLARKE THE BURIED MAID. And they have laid thee in thy narrow cell, Maid of the matchless brow!—for the cold clay To be thy bridegroom, till the eternal day, When the loud trump its judgment peal shall swell. So be it,—what the Almighty dooms is well,— But who that saw thine eyes' bright glances play, Thy cheek's fine flush, that mock'd the blooms of May, So late—could dream of death's dissolving spell? To rapture love had sung—“the bright eyed hour Soon will I lead along, with Hymen's train, To bless the blushing virgin, and the swain;— And hope believed, and lighted up her bower; Sudden the scene was changed—a radiant flower Sunk its sweet head—and love's glad song was vain! INSCRIPTION. Whoe'er thou art, to whom this secret shade Inviting seems, where many a wild flower flings Its odor round, and many a murmur soothes Of distant falling waters the pleased ear;— If solitude may claim thy thoughts awhile, Here rest and meditate—her cell is here. And say, does love thy willing bosom bind, Thy heart all anxiousness,—thy soul all sigh? Haply the virgin, in whose clasping arms A promised paradise thy fancy paints, Whose swelling bosom heaves upon the sight More beautiful than ocean's foam-tipt wave— Whose kindling eyes, with lavish lustre, thrill Thy trembling frame,—(a meek simplicity, And innocence assuming,—specious show!) Exults, in wanton triumph, at thy sighs, And mocks their incense.—Rouse thee from thy trance; And let the light of reason guide thee safe To love's pure altar. Does ambition urge Thy steps to tempt her dangerous paths?—Beware! Think how the storm can rage:—yet the rough blast That lays the mighty oak a ruin round, With all its hundred arms that waved to heaven, Passes as harmless o'er the lowly blossom, As does the zephyr's sigh. And rivers strong, Rushing their rugged channels through, each rock, Opposing, chafes to angry foam and roar. While the hush'd stream, fed from its placid fount, Winds through the flow'ry vale its silver way: And, as a quiet pilgrim seeks his shrine, Flows on, to wed with ocean's distant tide. Mortal!—whoe'er thou art, should thy pursuit Be happiness—thou need'st not wander far, If in thy breast no baneful passions wage Unholy warfare; and religion mild Has led thy steps to her own hallow'd mount, Where hope, with upward eye, and seraph wand Points to the sky:—but if thy blacken'd heart Nourish revenge, or hatred, or the asp Of envy pale—or discontentment's gall O'erflows within—or filthy avarice Disturbs thy dreams,—thou, curst of heaven, shalt find Peace but a sound—and happiness a shade! THE NUN. Her eye is raised to heaven:—no ray is there Of earthly pride, or passion. O'er her brow Angelic, as she breathes the solemn vow, A bright expression spreads. Her rich, soft hair, In radiant ringlets, down her bosom fair Falls—like the beams of morning on the prow Of the light heaving bark. 'T is past, and now A pale and pensive hue her features wear. So young—so beautiful, to turn aside From life's fresh opening scenes, and sunny hours, Seems like religion's triumph—but the heart Strives from itself in vain the truth to hide: The sigh will rise, the tender tear will start: Ah! love yet lingers o'er his faded flowers! WILLIAM CROSWELL. CONFIRMATION. The white-stoled Bishop stood amid a crowd— Noviciates all—who, tutor'd to revere The mitre's holy offices, drew near, And, after sins renounced, and pledges vow'd, Pale with emotion and religious fear, In meek subjection, round the chancel, bow'd, To hallow'd hands, that o'er them, one by one, Fell, with a Prelate's thrilling benison. Thou who canst make the loadstone's touch impart An active virtue to the temper'd steel, Oh let thy hand rest on them till they feel A new-born impulse stirring in the heart, And, swinging from surrounding objects, free, Point, with a tremulous confidence to Thee! DRINK AND AWAY. There is a beautiful rill in Barbary received into a large basin, which bears a name signifying “Drink and Away,” from the great danger of meeting with rogues and assassins.— Dr Shaw. Up! pilgrim and rover, Redouble thy haste! Nor rest thee till over Life's wearisome waste. Ere the wild forest ranger Thy footsteps betray To trouble and danger,— Oh drink and away! Here lurks the dark savage, By night and by day, To rob and to ravage, Nor scruples to slay. He waits for the slaughter: The blood of his prey Shall stain the still water,— Then drink and away! With toil though thou languish, The mandate obey, Spur on, though in anguish, There 's death in delay! No blood-hound, want-wasted, Is fiercer than they:— Pass by it untasted— Or drink and away! Though sore be the trial, Thy God is thy stay, Though deep the denial, Yield not in dismay, But wrapt in high vision, Look on to the day When the fountains elysian Thy thirst shall allay. There shalt thou for ever Enjoy thy repose Where life's gentle river Eternally flows, Yea, there shalt thou rest thee For ever and aye, With none to molest thee— Then, drink and away. HOME. I knew my father's chimney top, Though nearer to my heart than eye, And watch'd the blue smoke reeking up Between me and the winter sky. Wayworn I traced the homeward track, My wayward youth had left with joy; Unchanged in soul I wander'd back, A man, in years—in heart, a boy. I thought upon its cheerful hearth, And cheerful hearts' untainted glee, And felt of all I'd seen on earth, This was the dearest spot to me. SONNET VINDICATORY. Nuns fret not at their Convent's narrow room; And Hermits are contented with their cells; And Students with their pensive citadels; Maids at the wheel, the Weaver at his loom, Sit blithe and happy; Bees that soar for bloom, High as the highest peak of Furness Fells, Will murmur by the hour in fox-glove bells. In truth the prison unto which we doom Ourselves, no prison is; and hence to me, In sundry moods, 't was pastime to be bound Within the sonnet's scanty plot of ground; Pleased if some souls (for such there needs must be) Who 've felt the weight of too much liberty, Should find short solace there, as I have found. SOUTH SEA MISSIONARIES. With pleasure not unmix'd with pain, They find their passage o'er, As with the Sabbath's dawn they gain That islet's rocky shore. Behind them is the sweltry main, The torrid land before. No sound was in the silence heard To break the air of balm, Save when the screaming tropic bird Wheel'd seaward in the calm: The faint and heated breeze scarce stirr'd The streamers of the palm. The shipman in the distance sees Across the glowing bay, The crowded, strawbuilt cottages, Like sunburnt ricks of hay, Beneath the tall banana trees, Bask in the morning ray. And as that self-devoted band Of christian hearts drew near, No cool and bracing current fann'd The lifeless atmosphere;— Why should they seek that savage land So desolate and drear? In faith, those far-off shores they trod, This humble six or seven, And through those huts of matted sod Shall spread the gospel leaven, Till each becomes a house of God, A mercy gate of Heaven. CHRISTMAS. The thickly woven boughs they wreathe Through every hallow'd fane, A soft reviving odor breathe Of Summer's gentle reign; And rich the ray of mild green light Which like an emerald's glow, Comes struggling through the latticed height, Upon the crowds below. O let the streams of solemn thought Which in those temples rise From deeper sources spring than aught Dependant on the skies. Then though the summer's glow departs, And winter's withering chill Rests on the cheerless woods, our hearts Shall be unchanging still. JAMES HALL WEDDED LOVE'S FIRST HOME. 'T was far beyond yon mountains, dear, we plighted vows of love, The ocean wave was at our feet, the autumn sky above, The pebbly shore was covered o'er with many a varied shell, And on the billows' curling spray, the sunbeams glittering fell. The storm has vexed that billow oft, and oft that sun hath set, But plighted love remains with us, in peace and lustre yet. I wiled thee to a lonely haunt, that bashful love might speak, Where none could hear what love revealed, or see the crimson cheek; The shore was all deserted, and we wandered there alone, And not a human step impress'd the sand beach but our own; The footsteps all have vanish'd from the billow beaten strand— The vows we breathed remain with us—they were not traced in sand. Far, far, we left the sea-girt shore, endear'd by childhood's dream, To seek the humble cot, that smiled by fair Ohio's stream. In vain the mountain cliff opposed, the mountain torrent roar'd, For love unfurl'd her silken wing, and o'er each barrier soar'd; And many a wide domain we passed, and many an ample dome, But none so bless'd, so dear to us, as wedded love's first home. Beyond these mountains, now are all, that e'er we loved or knew, The long remembered many, and the dearly cherished few; The home of her we value, and the grave of him we mourn, Are there; and there is all the part to which the heart can turn; But dearer scenes surround us here, and lovelier joys we trace, For here is wedded love's first home—its hallowed resting place. A. M. WELLS. HOPE. There sits a woman on the brow Of yonder rocky height; There, gazing o'er the waves below, She sits from morn till night. She heeds not how the mad waves leap Along the rugged shore; She looks for one upon the deep She never may see more. As morning twilight faintly gleams, Her shadowy form I trace; Wrapt in the silvery mist, she seems The Genius of the place! Far other once was Rosalie; Her smile was glad; her voice, Like music o'er a summer sea, Said to the heart—rejoice. O'er her pure thoughts did sorrow fling Perchance a shade, 't would pass, Lightly as glides the breath of Spring Along the bending grass. A sailor's bride 't was hers to be:— Wo to the faithless main! Nine summers since he went to sea, And ne'er returned again. But long, where all is wrecked beside, And every joy is chased, Long, long will lingering Hope abide Amid the dreary waste! Nine years—though all have given him o'er, Her spirit doth not fail; And still she waits along the shore The never coming sail. On that high rock, abrupt and bare, Ever she sits, as now; The dews have damped her flowing hair, The sun has scorched her brow. And every far-off sail she sees, And every passing cloud, Or white-winged sea-bird, on the breeze, She calls to it aloud. The sea-bird answers to her cry; The cloud, the sail float on.— The hoarse wave mocks her misery, Yet is her hope not gone:— It cannot go:—with that to part, So long, so fondly nursed, So mingled with her faithful heart, That heart itself would burst. When falling dews the clover steep, And birds are in their nest, And flower-buds folded up to sleep, And ploughmen gone to rest, Down the rude track her feet have worn, —There scarce the goat may go;— Poor Rosalie, with look forlorn, Is seen descending slow. But when the gray morn tints the sky, And lights that lofty peak,— With a strange lustre in her eye, A fever in her cheek, Again she goes, untired, to sit And watch, the live-long day; Nor till the star of eve is lit, E'er turns her steps away. Hidden, and deep, and never dry,— Or flowing, or at rest, A living spring of hope doth lie In every human breast. All else may fail, that soothes the heart,— All, save that fount alone; With that and life at once we part, For life and hope are one. THE TAMED EAGLE. He sat upon his humble perch, nor flew At my approach; But as I nearer drew, Looked on me, as I fancied, with reproach, And sadness too: And something still his native pride proclaim'd, Despite his wo; Which, when I marked,—ashamed To see a noble creature brought so low, My heart exclaim'd, Where is the fire that lit thy fearless eye, Child of the storm, When from thy home on high, Yon craggy-breasted rock, I saw thy form Cleaving the sky? It grieveth me to see thy spirit tamed; Gone out the light That in thine eye-ball flamed, When to the midday sun thy steady flight Was proudly aimed! Like the young dove forsaken, is the look Of thy sad eye, Who in some lonely nook, Mourneth upon the willow bough her destiny, Beside the brook. While somewhat sterner in thy downward gaze Doth seem to lower, And deep disdain betrays, As if thou cursed man's poorly acted power, And scorned his praise. Oh, let not me insult thy fallen dignity, Poor injured bird, Gazing with vulgar eye Upon thy ruin;—for my heart is stirr'd To hear thy cry; And answereth to thee, as I turn to go, It is a stain On man!—Thus, even thus low Be brought the wretch, who could for sordid gain, Work thee such wo! R. H. WILDE A FRAGMENT. “'T is many moons ago—a long—long time Since first upon this shore a white man trod; From the great water to the mountain clime This was our home;—'t was given us by the God That gave ye yours.—Love ye your native sod? So did our fathers too—for they were men! They fought to guard it, for their hearts were brave, And long they fought—we were a people then; This was our country—it is now our grave— Would I had never lived, or died the land to save. When first ye came, your numbers were but few, Our nation many as the leaves or sand: Hungry and tired ye were—we pitied you— We called you brothers—took you by the hand— But soon we found ye came to rob the land: We quarrell'd—and your countrymen we slew, Till one alone of all, remain'd behind, Among the false he only had been true, And much we loved this man of single mind, And ever while he lived, to him were kind. He loved us too, and taught us many things, And much we strove the stranger's heart to glad; But to its kindred still the spirit clings, And therefore was his soul for ever sad; Nor other wish or joy the lone one had, Save on the solitary shore to roam, Or sit and gaze for hours upon the deep, That roll'd between him and his native home; And when he thought none mark'd him, he would weep, Or sing this song of wo which still our maidens keep. “My life is like the summer rose That opens to the morning sky, And ere the shades of evening close, Is scatter'd on the ground—to die! Yet on that rose's humble bed The softest dews of night are shed, As though she wept such waste to see,— But none shall drop a tear for me! My life is like the autumn leaf That trembles in the moon's pale ray, Its hold is frail—its date is brief, Restless—and soon to pass away! Yet, when that leaf shall fall and fade, The parent tree will mourn its shade, The wind bewail the leafless tree, But none shall breathe one sigh for me! My life is like the track of feet Left upon Tampa's desert strand; Soon as the rising tide shall beat, Their marks shall vanish from the sand; Yet, as if grieving to efface All vestige of the human race, On that lone shore loud moans the sea, But none shall thus lament for me!” SAMUEL BARTLETT PARRIS ON A SPRIG OF JUNIPER, FROM THE TOMB OF WASHINGTON, PRESENTED TO THE AUTHOR. The meadow may boast of its thousand dyes, For their varied splendors are far before thee; But still more fair in the patriot's eyes Is the humblest branch from the trunk that bore thee; For the place where it grows is a sacred spot, With remembrance of high achievements fraught. Thou didst not thrive on the blood of the slave, Whom the reeking sword of oppression slaughter'd; But the grateful tears of the good and brave, With a purer stream thy roots have water'd— And green didst thou grow o'er the hero's bed, When the tears of his patriot son This was written soon after La Fayette visited the tomb of Washington. were shed. Say, where wert thou half an age ago, When terrors were thronging around our nation— Where our land, by the word of its haughty foe, Was mark'd with the sentence of desolation— When the banner of freedom was wide unfurl'd On the natal day of this western world— When our fathers spared no pain nor toil, To purchase the blessing for their descendants, And seal'd with their blood on their native soil Their claim to the glory of Independence— When Life, Wealth, Honor, were all at stake That the holy cause they would not forsake. Perhaps thou wast by the side of thy sire, Whose branch to the breeze had for ages trembled, Where gather'd around the council-fire The chiefs of the tawny tribes assembled,— Or it might have shaded the hunter's track On the lonely banks of the Potomac. And long on the place of the hero's sleep May flourish the trunk, whence thou wert taken, But a grateful nation his name shall keep, When lifeless and bare, of its leaves forsaken, The trunk and the branch to the earth are cast Before the might of the rushing blast. For in distant ages the day shall come, When the vengeance of time its pride shall humble— And the arch of the proud mausoleum O'er the mouldering urn of the dead shall crumble— But till the last moment of time hath run Shall live the remembrance of Washington. Ah! soon must branches like thine be spread O'er another's tomb—and o'er yet another's— For now from the sorrows of earth have fled, As with one accord, two patriot brothers, Adams and Jefferson. Whom heaven in mercy hath given to see The day of their nation's Jubilee. O! sadly, in tears sunk down, that day, The sun, in the distant west declining— But still in a holier splendor they With their latest beams on earth were shining, When they were call'd from earth to remove, And shine in the realms of the blest above. WILLIAM CUTTER THE VALLEY OF SILENCE. Has thy foot ever trod that silent dell?— 'T is a place for the voiceless thought to swell, And the eloquent song to go up unspoken, Like the incense of flowers whose urns are broken; And the unveil'd heart may look in and see, In that deep, strange silence, its motions free, And learn how the pure in spirit feel That unseen Presence to which they kneel. No sound goes up from the quivering trees, When they spread their arms to the welcome breeze, They wave in the zephyr, they bow to the blast, But they breathe not a word of the power that pass'd; And their leaves come down on the turf and the stream, With as noiseless a fall as the step of a dream; And the breath that is bending the grass and the flowers Moves o'er them as lightly as evening hours. The merry bird lights down on that dell, And hushing his breath, lest the song should swell, Sits with folded wing, in the balmy shade, Like a musical thought in the soul unsaid; And they of strong pinion and loftier flight Pass over that valley, like clouds in the night— They move not a wing in that solemn sky, But sail in a reverent silence by. The deer in his flight has pass'd that way, And felt the deep spell's mysterious sway— He hears not the rush of the path he cleaves, Nor his bounding step on the trampled leaves. The hare goes up on that sunny hill— And the footsteps of morning are not more still. And the wild, and the fierce, and the mighty are there— Unheard in the hush of that slumbering air. The stream rolls down in that valley serene, Content in its beautiful flow to be seen; And its fresh, flowery banks, and its pebbly bed Were never yet told of its fountain-head. And it still rushes on—but they ask not why; With its smile of light it is hurrying by; Still gliding or leaping, unwhisper'd, unsung, Like the flow of bright fancies it flashes along. The wind sweeps by, and the leaves are stirr'd, But never a whisper or sigh is heard; And when its strong rush laid low the oak, Not a murmur the eloquent stillness broke; And the gay young echoes, those mockers that lie In the dark mountain sides, make no reply; But hush'd in their caves, they are listening still For the songs of that valley to burst o'er the hill. I love society; I am o'erblest to hear The mingling voices of a world; mine ear Drinks in their music with a spiritual taste; I love companionship on life's gray waste, And might not live unheard;—yet that still vale— It had no fearful mystery in its tale— Its hush was grand, not awful—as if there The voice of nature were a breathing prayer. 'T was like a holy temple, where the pure Might join in their hush'd worship, and be sure No sound of earth could come—a soul kept still, In faith's unanswering meekness, for Heaven's will— Its eloquent thoughts sent upward and abroad, But all its deep, hush'd voices kept for God! CHARLES C. BEAMAN THE WATER EXCURSION. A VISION. The earth it was gay, And the air was bland With the summer ray Of a sunny land; And the evening hour Of soul-witching power, With her radiant train, Lit the earth and main; When a beautiful barque was seen to glide, Like a fairy sylph on the silver tide; Not a zephyr breathed in her snow-white sails, What cared she for the prospering gales? Full many a rower was plying the oar, And she was flying away from the shore, To wander alone on the trackless deep, While the world was hush'd in a breathless sleep. All that the hand of taste could do, Banners floating of every hue, Flowery wreath and sparkling gem, Girdled her round from stern to stem; The fairest of the land was there, With snowy robe and raven hair, Bright eyes that beam'd expression's fire, Beauty, all that hearts desire; The flower of youthful chivalry, With the young love's idolatry, Offer'd homage at the shrine Of woman's loveliness divine; While the sweet and blithesome song, Uprose from the joyous throng; And the barque moved on in light, Graceful as the queen of night, Beautiful isles sprinkled the bay, Silver'd o'er with the moonbeam's ray; Verdure-clad isles, where shrubs and flowers, The foliage of trees and bowers, With fanciful dwellings woven between, An air of enchantment breathed o'er the scene; The beauties of nature blended with art, Delight the most soothing gave to the heart; The air around them was freighted with balm; The harp's soft notes added grace to the charm; As it broke from the covert of a flowery grove, With woman's sweet voice—the tones that we love! They passed the island—alone on the sea Broke the sound of their mirth and minstrelsy; The barque glided on to the music's swell, The silvery foam from the oar-blade fell, When suddenly broke on the ravish'd ear, Sounds that seem'd borne from a happier sphere; The oarsmen plied no more their task, Hush'd was the jest and jocund song; And one more bold was heard to ask, To whom do all these notes belong? No answer came—they look'd and saw What made them wonder and adore; Seraphic forms in radiant white, Sparkling in the moonbeam's light; Circling round in the ocean's breast, They lull'd every care to rest; With golden harps they woke a strain, No mortal hand can e'er attain, Then mingling voices thrill'd the frame, With rapture's most ecstatic flame— The vision fled—I woke to see Thy duller scenes—reality! EVENING THOUGHTS. How fades the world before me now! As lonely here I stand; The dews of evening on my brow, And silver on the land! It seems to me a floating speck, The fragment of a cloud;— Are all my hopes upon that wreck, Oblivion soon will shroud? Oh no! I have a hope afar, Among those orbs of light; It twinkleth yet, the Bethlehem star, As on its natal night. Spring up, my soul! and catch the ray, And nurse it to a flame; 'T will burn in life's expiring day, For ever—and the same. LOUISA P. SMITH THE HUMA. “A bird peculiar to the east. It is supposed to fly constantly in the air, and never touch the ground” Fly on! nor touch thy wing, bright bird, Too near our shaded earth, Or the warbling, now so sweetly heard May lose its note of mirth. Fly on—nor seek a place of rest, In the home of “care-worn things,” 'T would dim the light of thy shining crest, And thy brightly burnish'd wings, To dip them where the waters glide That flow from a troubled earthly tide. The fields of upper air are thine, Thy place where stars shine free, I would thy home, bright one, were mine, Above life's stormy sea. I would never wander—bird, like thee, So near this place again, With wing and spirit once light and free— They should wear no more, the chain With which they are bound and fetter'd here, For ever struggling for skies more clear. There are many things like thee, bright bird, Hopes as thy plumage gay, Our air is with them for ever stirr'd, But still in air they stay. And happiness, like thee, fair one! Is ever hovering o'er, But rests in a land of brighter sun, On a waveless, peaceful shore, And stoops to lave her weary wings, Where the fount of “living waters” springs. RECOLLECTIONS. I've pleasant thoughts that memory brings, in moments free from care, Of a fairy-like and laughing girl, with roses in her hair; Her smile was like the star-light of summer's softest skies, And worlds of joyousness there shone, from out her witching eyes. Her looks were looks of melody, her voice was like the swell Of sudden music, notes of mirth, that of wild gladness tell; She came like spring, with pleasant sounds of sweetness and of mirth, And her thoughts were those wild, flowery ones, that linger not on earth. A quiet goodness beam'd amid the beauty of her face, And all she said and did, was with its own instinctive grace; She seem'd as if she thought the world a good and pleasant one, And her light spirit saw no ill, in all beneath the sun. I 've dream'd of just such creatures, but they never met my view 'Mid the sober, dull reality, in their earthly form and hue. And her smile came gently over me, like spring's first scented airs, And made me think life was not all a wilderness of cares. I know not of her destiny, or where her smile now strays, But the thought of her comes o'er me, with my own lost sunny days, With moonlight hours, and far-off friends, and many pleasant things, That have gone the way of all the earth on time's resistless wings. J. G. WHITTIER THE SICILIAN VESPERS. Silence o'er sea and earth With the veil of evening fell, Till the convent tower sent deeply forth The chime of its vesper bell. One moment—and that solemn sound Fell heavy on the ear; But a sterner echo pass'd around; And the boldest shook to hear. The startled monks throng'd up, In the torch-light cold and dim; And the priest let fall his incense-cup, And the virgin hush'd her hymn; For a boding clash, and a clanging tramp, And a summoning voice were heard, And fretted wall, and tombstone damp, To the fearful echo stirr'd. The peasant heard the sound, As he sat beside his hearth; And the song and the dance were hush'd around, With the fireside tale of mirth. The chieftain shook in his banner'd hall, As the sound of fear drew nigh; And the warder shrank from the castle wall, As the gleam of spears went by. Wo—wo—to the stranger then; At the feast and flow of wine, In the red array of mailed men, Or bow'd at the holy shrine; For the waken'd pride of an injured land Had burst its iron thrall; From the plumed chief to the pilgrim band; Wo!—wo!—to the sons of Gaul! Proud beings fell that hour, With the young and passing fair, And the flame went up from dome and tower; The avenger's arm was there! The stranger priest at the altar stood, And clasped his beads in prayer, But the holy shrine grew dim with blood; The avenger found him there! Wo!—wo! to the sons of Gaul; To the serf and mailed lord; They were gather'd darkly, one and all, To the harvest of the sword; And the morning sun, with a quiet smile, Shone out o'er hill and glen, On ruin'd temple and mouldering pile, And the ghastly forms of men. Ay, the sunshine sweetly smiled, As its early glance came forth; It had no sympathy with the wild And terrible things of earth; And the man of blood that day might read, In a language freely given, How ill his dark and midnight deed Became the calm of heaven. F. S. ECKHARD THE RUINED CITY. The days of old, though time has rest The dazzling splendor which they cast; Yet many a remnant still is left To shadow forth the past. The warlike deed, the classic page, The lyric torrent strong and free, Are lingering o'er the gloom of age, Like moonlight on the sea. A thousand years have roll'd along, And blasted empires in their pride; And witness'd scenes of crime and wrong, Till men by nations died. A thousand summer suns have shone Till earth grew bright beneath their sway, Since thou, untenanted, and lone, Wert render'd to decay. The moss tuft, and the ivy wreath, For ages clad thy fallen mould, And gladden'd in the spring's soft breath; But they grew wan and old. Now, desolation hath denied That even these shall veil thy gloom: And nature's mantling beauty died In token of thy doom. Alas, for the far years, when clad With the bright vesture of thy prime, The proud towers made each wanderer glad, Who hail'd thy sunny clime. Alas, for the fond hope, and dream, And all that won thy children's trust, God cursed—and none may now redeem, Pale city of the dust! How the dim visions throng the soul, When twilight broods upon thy waste; The clouds of wo from o'er thee roll, Thy glory seems replaced. The stir of life is brightening round, Thy structures swell upon the eye, And mirth and revelry resound In triumph to the sky. But a stern moral may be read, By those who view thy lonely gloom: Oblivion's pall alike is spread O'er slave, and lordly tomb. The sad, the gay, the old, and young, The warrior's strength, and beauty's glow, Resolved to that from which they sprung Compose the dust below.</field>
