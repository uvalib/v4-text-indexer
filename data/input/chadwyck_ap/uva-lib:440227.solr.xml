      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME I MORNING HYMN Now I see the morning light, Shining bright and gay. God has kept me through the night; He will, if He thinks it right, Preserve me through this day. Let thy holy Spirit send Of heavenly light a ray; Thy face, oh! Lord, I fain would seek, But I am feeble, vain and weak; Oh, guide me in thy way! Let thy assistance, Lord, be given, That when life's path I 've trod, And when the last frail tie is riven, My spirit may ascend to heaven, To dwell with thee, My God. âFather's Birthdayâ:â Louisa brings a cushion rare, Anne Eliza a toothpick bright and fair; And O! accept the gift I bring, It is a daughter's offering. [The Milsiad] My heart fills With the bare thought of the illustrious Mills: That man of eyes and nose, Of legs and arms, of fingers and of toes. To lands devoid of tax Goeth he not, armed with axe? Trees shall he cut down, And forests ever? Tame cataracts with a frown? Grin all the fish from Mississippi River? (My style is grandiose. Quite in the tone of Mills's nose.) Harp of the West, through wind and foggy weather We've sung our passage to our native land, Now I have reached the terminus of tether, And I must lay thee trembling from my hand. That hand must ply the ignominious needle, This mind brood o'er the salutary dish, I must grow sober as a parish beadle, And having fish to fry, must fry my fish. Some happier muse than mine shall wake thy spell, Harp of the West, oh Gemini! farewell! [Miss Mary Big'low, you who seem] Miss Mary Big'low, you who seem So debonair and kind, Pray, what the devil do you mean (If I may speak my mind) By asking me to come and hear That Wulf of yours a-Friesing, Then leaving me to cool my heels In manner so unpleasing? With Mrs. Dr. Susan you That eve, forsooth, were tea-ing: Confess you knew that I should come, And from my wrath were fleeing! To Mrs. Dr. Susan's I Had not invited been: So when the maid said, âBest go there!â I answered, âNot so green!â Within the darksome carriage hid I bottled up my beauty, And, rather foolish, hurried home To fireside and duty. It's very pleasant, you may think, On winter nights to roam; But when you next invite abroad, This wolf will freeze at home! âTableâ What shall we do for an Editor's table? To make one really we are not able. Our Editorial head is aching, Our lily white hand is rather shaking. Our baby cries both day and night, And puts our âintelligenceâ all to flight. Yet, for the gentle Julia's sake, Some little effort we must make. We did n't go vote for the know-nothing Mayor, A know-nothing's what we cannot bear, We know our lessons, that's well for us, Or the school would be in a terrible fuss. That's all for the present, we make our best bow, And are your affectionate Editor Howe. âMad Songâ âHer mother was a Shaw, And her father was a Tompkins; Her sister was a bore, And her brother was a bumpkin; Oh! Sociâoh! Sociâ Oh! Sociâeâty! âHer flounces were of gold, And her slippers were of ermine; And she looked a little bold When she rose to lead the Germin; Oh! Sociâoh! Sociâ Oh! Sociâeâty! âFor my part I never saw Where she kept her fascination; But I thought she had an aw- Ful conceit and affectation; Oh! Sociâoh! Sociâ Oh! Sociâeâty!â THE BARNSTABLE BALL A Lyric (Appointed to be sung in all Social Meetings on the Cape) March away with your old artillery; Don't come back till we give you a call. Put your Colonel into the pillory; He broke up the Barnstable Ball. Country folks don't go a-pleasuring Every day, as it doth befall; They with deepest scorn are measuring Him who broke up the Barnstable Ball. He came down with his motley company, Stalking round the 'cultural hall; Could n't find a partner to jump any, So broke up the Barnstable Ball. Warn't it enough with their smoking and thundering, Sweeping about like leaves in a squall, But they must take to theft and plundering,â Steal the half of the Barnstable Ball? Put the music into their pocket, Order the figure-man not to bawl, Twenty jigs were still on the docket, When they adjourned the Barnstable Ball. Gov'nor A. won't hang for homicide, That's a point that bothers us all; He must banish ever from his side Such as murdered the Barnstable Ball. When they're old and draw'd with rheumatiz, Let them say to their grandbabes small, âDeary me, what a shadow of gloom it is To remember the Barnstable Ball!â To S. G. H. On his failure to receive the Grecian mission which he had been led to think might be offered to him. 1866. The Grecian olives vanish from thy sight, The wondrous hills, the old historic soil; The elastic air, that freshened with delight Thy youthful temples, flushed with soldier toil. O noble soul! thy laurel early wreathed Gathers the Christian rose and lilies fair, For civic virtues when the sword was sheathed, And perfect faith that learns from every snare. Let, then, the modern embassy float by, Nor one regret in thy high bosom lurk: God's mission called thy youth to that soft sky; Wait God's dismissal where thou build'st His work! [Oh! who were the people you saw, Mrs. Howe] Oh! who were the people you saw, Mrs. Howe, When you went where the Cretans were making a row? KalopathakiâRodocanachiâ PaparipopoulosâAnagnostopoulosâ NicolaÃ¯desâParaskevaÃ¯desâ These were the people that saw Mrs. Howe When she went where the Cretans were making a row. Oh! what were the projects you made, Mrs. Howe, When you went where the Cretans were making a row? Emancipationâcivilizationâredintegration of a great nation, Paying no taxes, grinding no axesâ Flinging the Ministers over the banisters. These were the projects of good Mrs. Howe When she went where the Cretans were making a row. Oh! give us a specimen, dear Mrs. Howe, Of the Greek that you learned and are mistress of now. PotichomaniaâMesopotamia. Tatterdemalionâepiscopalianâ Megalotheriumâmonster inferiumâ Scoulevonâauctrionâinfant phenomenon. Kyrie ticameteâwhat's your calamity? Pallas Athenae Aun, Favors no Fenian. Such is the language that learned Mrs. Howe, In the speech of the Gods she is mistress of now. COOKERY BOOKERY, OH! My Irish cook has gone away Upon my dinner-party day; I don't know what to do or sayâ Cookery bookery, oh! Chorus: Sing, saucepan, range, and kitchen fire! Sing, coals are high and always higher! Sing, crossed and vexed, till you expire! Cookery bookery, oh! She could cook every kind of dish, âWittlesâ of meat and âwittlesâ of fish, And soup as fancy as you wishâ And she is gone away! She weighed two hundred pounds of cheek, She had a voice that made me meek, I had to listen when she did speakâ Cookery bookery, oh! My husband comes, a saucy elf, And eyes the saucepan on the shelf; Says he, âWhy don't you cook yourself?â Cookery bookery, oh! Chorus: Sing, saucepan, range, and kitchen fire! Sing, coals are high and always higher! Sing, crossed and vexed, till you expire! Cookery bookery, oh! âThe Newport Song,â Non sumus fashionabiles: Non damus dapes splendides: But in a modest way, you know, We like to see our money go; Et gaudeamus igitur, Our soul has nought to fidget her! We do not care to quadrigate On Avenues in gilded state: No gold-laced footmen laugh behind At our vacuity of mind: But in a modest one-horse shay, We rumble, tumble as we may, Et gaudeamus igitur, Our soul has nought to fidget her! When Ã¦stivation is at end, We've had our fun and seen our friend. No thought of payment makes us ill, We don't know such a word as âbillâ: Et gaudeamus igitur. Our soul has nought to fidget her! âInvitation to Youthâ Oh! let thy meditations be of God, Who guides thy footsteps with unerring eye; And who, until the path of life is trod, Will never leave thee by thyself to die. When morning's rays so joyously do shine, And nature brightens at the face of day, Oh! think then on the joys that shall be thine If thou wilt early walk the narrow way.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME II A MOMENT'S MEDITATION IN COLOGNE CATHEDRAL Enter Life's high cathedral With reverential heart, Its lofty oppositions Matched with divinest art. Thought with its other climbing To meet and blend on high; Man's mortal and immortal Wed for eternity. When noon's high mass is over, Muse in the silent aisles; Wait for the coming vespers In which new promise smiles. When from the dome height echoes An âIte, missa est,â Whisper thy last thanksgiving, Depart, and take thy rest. JANUARY 9, 1878 A voice of sorrow shakes the solemn pines Within the borders of the Apennines; A sombre vision veils the evening red, A shuddering whisper says: the King is dead. Low lies he near the throne That strange desert and fortune made his own; And at his life's completion, from his birth In one fair record, men recount his worth. Chief of the Vatican! Heir of the Peter who his Lord denied, Not of the faith which that offence might hide, Boast not, âI live, while he is coldly laid.â Say rather, in the jostling mortal race He first doth look on the All-father's face. Life's triple crown absolvÃ¨d weareth he, Clear Past, sad Present, fond Futurity. To Maud July 8, 1888. Grumble, grumbleâtumble, tumble, For something to eat, Fast-y fast-y nasty, nasty, At last, at last-y, Ma's dead beat! [Such ugly noises never in my life] Such ugly noises never in my life My ears endured, such hideous fiddle-strife. A dozen street bands playing different tunes, A choir of chimney sweeps with various runes, The horn that doth to farmer's dinner call, The Chinese gong that serves in wealthier hall, The hammer, scrub brush, and beseeching broom, While here and there the guns of freedom boom, âTzing! bang! this soul is saved!â âClang! clang! it is n't!â And mich and dich and ich and sich and sisn't! Five dollar bills the nauseous treat secured, But what can pay the public that endured? [Roses are the gift of God] âRoses are the gift of God, Laurels are the gift of fame; Add the beauty of thy life To the glory of thy name.â [Here's to Teddy] Here's to Teddy, Blythe and ready, Fit for each occasion! Who as he Acceptably Can represent the Nation? Neither ocean Binds his motion, Undismayed explorer; Challenge dares him, Pullman bears him Swifter than Aurora. Here's to Teddy! Let no eddy Block the onward current. Him we trust, And guard we must From schemes to sight abhorrent. When the tuba Called to Cuba Where the fight was raging, Rough and ready Riders led he, Valorous warfare waging. Here's to Teddy! Safe and steady, Loved by every section! South and North Will hurry forth To hasten his election. 1904. For Francis C. Stokes, Westtown School, Pennsylvania Auspicious be the rule Of love at Westtown School, And happy, mid his youthful folks The daily task of Master Stokes! [Friends! I would not ask to mingle] Friends! I would not ask to mingle This, my very foolish jingle, With the tributes more decorous of the feast we hold to-day; But the rhymes came, thick and swarming Just like bees when honey's forming, And I could not find a countersign to order them away. For around this sixteenth lustre Of our friend's, such memories cluster Of the days that lie behind it, full of glories and regrets, Days that brought their toils and troubles, Lit by some irradiant bubbles Which became prismatic opals in the sun that never sets. Picnics have we held together Sailing in the summer weather, Sitting low to taste the chowder on the sands of Newport Bay, And that wonderful charade, sir, You know well, sir, that you made, sir, When so many years of earnest did invite an hour of play. He shall rank now with the sages Who survive in classic pages, English, German, French and Latin, Greek, so weary to construe; Did he con his Epictetus Ere he came to-night to greet us? He, Ã oristos in reverence, among the learned few. He may climb no more the mountain, But he still employs the fountain Pen from whose incisive point pure Helicon may flow, And his âYesterdaysâ so cheerful Charm the world so wild and tearful, And the Devil calls for copy, and he never answers âNo.â Do I speak for everybody, When I utter this rhapsÃ²dy, To induce our friend to keep his pace in following Life's incline; Never slacken, but come on, sir, Eighty-four years I have won, sir; Still the olive branch shall bless you, still the laurel wreath entwine! So, you scribbling youths and lasses, Elders, too, fill high your glasses! Let the toast be Wentworth Higginson, of fourscore years possest; If the Man was good at twenty, He is four times that now, ain't he? We declare him four times excellent, and better than his best. MRS. HOWE'S REPLY Why, bless you, I ain't nothing, nor nobody, nor much, If you look in your Directory, you'll find a thousand such; I walk upon the level ground, I breathe upon the air, I study at a table, and reflect upon a chair. I know a casual mixture of the Latin and the Greek, I know the Frenchman's parlez-vous, and how the Germans speak; Well can I add, and well subtract, and say twice two is four, But of those direful sums and proofs remember nothing more. I wrote a pretty book one time, and then I wrote a play, And a friend who went to see it said she fainted right away. Then I got up high to speculate upon the Universe, And folks who heard me found themselves no better and no worse. Yes, I've had a lot of birthdays and I'm growing very old, That 's why they make so much of me, if once the truth were told. And I love the shade in summer, and in winter love the sun, And I'm just learning how to live, my wisdom 's just begun. Don't trouble more to celebrate this natal day of mine, But keep the grasp of fellowship which warms us more than wine. Let us thank the lavish hand that gives world beauty to our eyes, And bless the days that saw us young, and years that make us wise. [Mark the gracious, welcome guest] âMark the gracious, welcome guest, Master of heroic jest; He who cheers man's dull abodes With the laughter of the gods; To the joyless ones of earth Sounds the reveille of mirth. âWell we meet, to part with pain, But ne'er shall he and we be Twain.â</field>
