      <field name="fulltext">THE REDBIRD From âWild Thorn and Lilyâ Among the white haw-blossoms, where the creek Droned under drifts of dogwood and of haw, The redbird, like a crimson blossom blown Against the snow-white bosom of the Spring, The chaste confusion of her lawny breast, Sang on, prophetic of serener days, As confident as June's completer hours. And I stood listening like a hind, who hears A wood nymph breathing in a forest flute Among the beech-boles of myth-haunted ways: And when it ceased, the memory of the air Blew like a syrinx in my brain: I made A lyric of the notes that men might know: He flies with flirt and flutingâ As flies a crimson star From flaming star-beds shootingâ From where the roses are. Wings past and sings; and seven Notes, wild as fragrance is,â That turn to flame in heaven,â Float round him full of bliss. He sings; each burning feather Thrills, throbbing at his throat; A song of firefly weather, And of a glowworm boat: Of Elfland and a princess Who, born of a perfume, His music rocks,âwhere winces That rosebud's cradled bloom. No bird sings half so airy, No bird of dusk or dawn, Thou masking King of Faery! Thou red-crowned Oberon! THE BLACK KNIGHT I had not found the road too short, As once I had in days of youth, In that old forest of long ruth, Where my young knighthood broke its heart, Ere love and it had come to part, And lies made mockery of truth. I had not found the road too short. A blind man, by the nightmare way, Had set me right when I was wrong.â I had been blind my whole life longâ What wonder then that on this day The blind should show me how astray My strength had gone, my heart once strong. A blind man pointed me the way. The road had been a heartbreak one, Of roots and rocks and tortured trees, And pools, above my horse's knees, And wandering paths, where spiders spun 'Twixt boughs that never saw the sun, And silence of lost centuries. The road had been a heartbreak one. It seemed long years since that black hour When she had fled, and I took horse To follow, and without remorse To slay her and her paramour In that old keep, that ruined tower, From whence was borne her father's corse. It seemed long years since that black hour. And now my horse was starved and spent, My gallant destrier, old and spare; The vile road's mire in mane and hair, I felt him totter as he went:â Such hungry woods were never meant For pasture: hate had reaped them bare. Aye, my poor beast was old and spent. I too had naught to stay me with; And like my horse was starved and lean; My armor gone; my raiment mean; Bare-haired I rode; uneasy sith The way I'd lost, and some dark myth Far in the woods had laughed obscene. I had had naught to stay me with. Then I dismounted. Better so. And found that blind man at my rein. And there the path stretched straight and plain. I saw at once the way to go. The forest road I used to know In days when life had less of pain. Then I dismounted. Better so. I had but little time to spare, Since evening now was drawing near; And then I thought I saw a sneer Enter into that blind man's stare: And suddenly a thought leapt bare,â What if the Fiend had set him here!â I still might smite him or might spare. I braced my sword: then turned to look: For I had heard an evil laugh: The blind man, leaning on his staff, Still stood there where my leave I took: What! did he mock me? Would I brook A blind fool's scorn?âMy sword was half Out of its sheath. I turned to look: And he was gone. And to my side My horse came nickering as afraid. Did he too fear to be betrayed?â What use for him? I might not ride. So to a great bough there I tied, And left him in the forest glade: My spear and shield I left beside. My sword was all I needed there. It would suffice to right my wrongs; To cut the knot of all those thongs With which she'd bound me to despair, That woman with her midnight hair, Her Circe snares and Siren songs. My sword was all I needed there. And then that laugh again I heard, Evil as Hell and darkness are. It shook my heart behind its bar Of purpose, like some ghastly word. But then it may have been a bird, An owlet in the forest far, A raven, croaking, that I heard. I loosed my sword within its sheath; My sword, disuse and dews of night Had fouled with rust and iron-blight. I seemed to hear the forest breathe A menace at me through its teeth Of thorns 'mid which the way lay white. I loosed my sword within its sheath. I had not noticed until now The sun was gone, and gray the moon Hung staring; pale as marble hewn;â Like some old malice, bleak of brow, It glared at me through leaf and bough, With which the tattered way was strewn. I had not noticed until now. And then, all unexpected, vast Above the tops of ragged pines I saw a ruin, dark with vines, Against the blood-red sunset massed: My perilous tower of the past, Round which the woods thrust giant spines. I never knew it was so vast. Long while I stood considering.â This was the place and this the night. The blind man then had set me right. Here she had come for sheltering. That ruin held her: that dark wing Which flashed a momentary light. Some time I stood considering. Deep darkness fell. The somber glare Of sunset, that made cavernous eyes Of those gaunt casements 'gainst the skies, Had burnt to ashes everywhere. Before my feet there rose a stair Of oozy stone, of giant size, On which the gray moon flung its glare. Then I went forward, sword in hand, Until the slimy causeway loomed, And huge beyond it yawned and gloomed The gateway where one seemed to stand, In armor, like a burning brand, Sword-drawn; his visor barred and plumed. And I went toward him, sword in hand. He should not stay revenge from me. Whatever lord or knight he were, He should not keep me long from her, That woman dyed in infamy. No matter. God or devil he, His sword should prove no barrier.â Fool! who would keep revenge from me! And then I heard, harsh over all, That demon laughter, filled with scorn: It woke the echoes, wild, forlorn, Dark in the ivy of that wall, As when, within a mighty hall, One blows a giant battle-horn. Loud, loud that laugh rang over all. And then I struck him where he towered: I struck him, struck with all my hate: Black-plumed he loomed before the gate: I struck, and found his sword that showered Fierce flame on mine while black he glowered Behind his visor's wolfish grate. I struck; and taller still he towered. A year meseemed we battled there: A year; ten years; a century: My blade was snapped; his lay in three: His mail was hewn; and everywhere Was blood; it streaked my face and hair; And still he towered over me. A year meseemed we battled there. âUnmask!â I cried. âYea, doff thy casque! Put up thy visor! fight me fair! I have no mail; my head is bare! Take off thy helm, is all I ask! Why dost thou hide thy face?âUnmask!ââ My eyes were blind with blood and hair, And still I cried, âTake off thy casque!â And then once more that laugh rang out Like madness in the caves of Hell: It hooted like some monster well, The haunt of owls, or some mad rout Of witches. And with battle shout Once more upon that knight I fell, While wild again that laugh rang out. Like Death's own eyes his glared in mine, As with the fragment of my blade I smote him helmwise; huge he swayed, Then crashed, like some cadaverous pine, Uncasqued, his face in full moonshine: And IâI saw; and shrank afraid. For, lo! behold! the face was mine. What devil's work was here!âWhat jest For fiends to laugh at, demons hiss!â To slay myself? and so to miss My hate's reward?ârevenge confessed!â Was this knight I?âMy brain I pressed.â Then who was he who gazed on this?â What devil's work was here!âWhat jest! It was myself on whom I gazedâ My darker self!âWith fear I rose.â I was right weak from those great blows.â I stood bewildered, stunned and dazed, And looked around with eyes amazed.â I could not slay her now, God knows!â Around me there a while I gazed. Then turned and fled into the night, While overhead once more I heard That laughter, like some demon bird Wailing in darkness.âThen a light Made clear a woman by that knight. I saw 'twas she, but said no word, And silent fled into the night. IN ARCADY I remember, when a child, How within the April wild Once I walked with Mystery In the groves of Arcady. ... Through the boughs, before, behind, Swept the mantle of the wind, Thunderous and unconfined. Overhead the curving moon Pierced the twilight: a cocoon, Golden, big with unborn wingsâ Beauty, shaping spiritual things, Vague, impatient of the night, Eager for its heavenward flight Out of darkness into light. Here and there the oaks assumed Satyr aspects; shadows gloomed, Hiding, of a dryad look; And the naiad-frantic brook, Crying, fled the solitude, Filled with terror of the wood, Or some faun-thing that pursued. In the dead leaves on the ground Crept a movement; rose a sound: Everywhere the silence ticked As with hands of things that picked At the loam, or in the dew,â Elvish sounds that crept or flew,â Beak-like, pushing surely through. Down the forest, overhead, Stammering a dead leaf fled, Filled with elemental fear Of some dark destruction nearâ One, whose glowworm eyes I saw Hag with flame the crookÃ¨d haw, Which the moon clutched like a claw. Gradually beneath the tree Grew a shape; a nudity: Lithe and slender; silent as Growth of tree or blade of grass; Brown and silken as the bloom Of the trillium in the gloom, Visible as strange perfume. For an instant there it stood, Smiling on me in the wood: And I saw its hair was green As the leaf-sheath, gold of sheen: And its eyes an azure wet, From within which seemed to jet Sapphire lights and violet. Swiftly by I saw it glide; And the dark was deified: Wild before it everywhere Gleamed the greenness of its hair; And around it danced a light, Soft, the sapphire of its sight, Making witchcraft of the night. On the branch above, the bird Trilled to it a dreamy word: In its bud the wild bee droned Honeyed greeting, drowsy-toned: And the brook forgot the gloom, Hushed its heart, and, wrapped in bloom, Breathed a welcome of perfume. To its beauty bush and tree Stretched sweet arms of ecstasy; And the soul within the rock Lichen-treasures did unlock As upon it fell its eye; And the earth, that felt it nigh, Into wildflowers seemed to sigh. ... Was it dryad? was it faun? Wandered from the times long gone. Was it sylvan? was it fay?â Dim survivor of the day When Religion peopled streams, Woods and rocks with shapes like gleams,â That invaded then my dreams? Was it shadow? was it shape? Or but fancy's wild escape?â Of my own child's world the charm That assumed material form?â Of my soul the mystery, That the spring revealed to me, There in long-lost Arcady?</field>
