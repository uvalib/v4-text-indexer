      <field name="fulltext">“If, however, I can, by lucky chance, in these days of evil, rub out one wrinkle from the brow of care, or beguile the heavy heart of one moment of sorrow; if I can, now and then, penetrate the gathering film of misanthropy, prompt a benevolent view of human nature, and make my reader more in good humor with his fellow beings and himself, surely, surely, I shall not then have written entirely in vain.” Washington Irving. TO GEORGE JAMES PUMPELLY, MY BEST AND MOST VALUED FRIEND, THIS BOOK IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR. SKETCH OF A SCHOOLFELLOW. He sat by me in school. His face is now Vividly in my mind, as if he went From me but yesterday—its pleasant smile And the rich, joyous laughter of his eye, And the free play of his unhaughty lip, So redolent of his heart! He was not fair, Nor singular, nor over-fond of books, And never melancholy when alone. He was the heartiest in the ring, the last Home from the summer's wanderings, and the first Over the threshold when the school was done. All of us loved him. We shall speak his name In the far years to come, and think of him When we have lost life's simplest passages, And pray for him—forgetting he is dead— Life was in him so passing beautiful! His childhood had been wasted in the close And airless city. He had never thought That the blue sky was ample, or the stars Many in heaven, or the chainless wind Of a medicinal freshness. He had learn'd Perilous tricks of manhood, and his hand Was ready, and his confidence in himself Bold as a quarreller's. Then he came away To the unshelter'd hills, and brought an eye New as a babe's to nature, and an ear As ignorant of its music. He was sad. The broad hill sides seem'd desolate, and the woods Gloomy and dim, and the perpetual sound Of wind and waters and unquiet leaves Like the monotony of a dirge. He pined For the familiar things until his heart Sicken'd for home!—and so he stole away To the most silent places, and lay down To weep upon the mosses of the slopes, And follow'd listlessly the silver streams, Till he found out the unsunn'd shadowings, And the green openings to the sky, and grew Fond of them all insensibly. He found Sweet company in the brooks, and loved to sit And bathe his fingers wantonly, and feel The wind upon his forehead; and the leaves Took a beguiling whisper to his ear, And the bird-voices music, and the blast Swept like an instrument the sounding trees. His heart went back to its simplicity As the stirr'd waters in the night grow pure— Sadness and silence and the dim-lit woods Won on his love so well—and he forgot His pride and his assumingness, and lost The mimicry of the man, and so unlearn'd His very character till he became As diffident as a girl. 'Tis very strange How nature sometimes wins upon a child. Th' experience of the world is not on him, And poetry has not upon his brain Left a mock thirst for solitude, nor love Writ on his forehead the effeminate shame Which hideth from men's eyes. He has a full, Shadowless heart, and it is always toned More merrily than the chastened voice of winds And waters—yet he often, in his mirth, Stops by the running brooks, and suddenly Loiters, he knows not why, and at the sight Of the spread meadows and the lifted hills Feels an unquiet pleasure, and forgets To listen for his fellows. He will grow Fond of the early star, and lie awake Gazing with many thoughts upon the moon, And lose himself in the deep chamber'd sky With his untaught philosophies. It breeds Sadness in older hearts, but not in his; And he goes merrier to his play, and shouts Louder the joyous call—but it will sink Into his memory like his mother's prayer, For after years to brood on. Cheerful thoughts Came to the homesick boy as he became Wakeful to beauty in the summer's change, And he came oftener to our noisy play, Cheering us on with his delightful shout Over the hills, and giving interest With his keen spirit to the boyish game. We loved him for his carelessness of himself, And his perpetual mirth, and tho' he stole Sometimes away into the woods alone, And wandered unaccompanied when the night Was beautiful, he was our idol still, And we have not forgotten him, tho' time Has blotted many a pleasant memory Of boyhood out, and we are wearing old With the unplayfulness of this grown up world. THE TRI-PORTRAIT. 'Twas a rich night in June. The air was all Fragrance and balm, and the wet leaves were stirred By the soft fingers of the southern wind, And caught the light capriciously, like wings Haunting the greenwood with a silvery sheen. The stars might not be numbered, and the moon Exceeding beautiful, went up in heaven, And took her place in silence, and a hush, Like the deep Sabbath of the night, came down And rested upon nature. I was out With three sweet sisters wandering, and my thoughts Took color of the moonlight, and of them, And I was calm and happy. Their deep tones, Low in the stillness, and by that soft air Melted to reediness, bore out, like song, The language of high feelings, and I felt How excellent is woman when she gives To the fine pulses of her spirit way. One was a noble being, with a brow Ample and pure, and on it her black hair Was parted, like a raven's wing on snow. Her tone was low and sweet, and in her smile You read intense affections. Her moist eye Had a most rare benignity; her mouth, Bland and unshadowed sweetness; and her face Was full of that mild dignity that gives A holiness to woman. She was one Whose virtues blossom daily, and pour out A fragrance upon all who in her path Have a blest fellowship. I longed to be Her brother, that her hand might lie upon My forehead, and her gentle voice allay The fever that is at my heart sometimes. There was a second sister who might witch An angel from his hymn. I cannot tell The secret of her beauty. It is more Than her slight penciled lip, and her arch eye Laughing beneath its lashes, as if life Were nothing but a merry mask; 'tis more Than motion, though she moveth like a fay; Or music, though her voice is like a reed Blown by a low south wind; or cunning grace, Though all she does is beautiful; or thought, Or fancy, or a delicate sense, though mind Is her best gift, and poetry her world, And she will see strange beauty in a flower As by a subtle vision. I care not To know how she bewitches; 'tis enough For me that I can listen to her voice And dream rare dreams of music, or converse Upon unwrit philosophy, till I Am wildered beneath thoughts I cannot bound And the red lip that breathes them. On my arm Leaned an unshadowed girl, who scarcely yet Had numbered fourteen summers. I know not How I shall draw her picture—the young heart Has such a restlessness of change, and each Of its wild moods so lovely! I can see Her figure in its rounded beauty now, With her half-flying step, her clustering hair Bathing a neck like Hebe's, and her face By a glad heart made radiant. She was full Of the romance of girlhood. The fair world Was like an unmarred Eden to her eye, And every sound was music, and the tint Of every cloud a silent poetry. Light to thy path, bright creature! I would charm Thy being if I could, that it should be Ever as now thou dreamest, and flow on Thus innocent and beautiful to heaven! We walked beneath the full and mellow moon Till the late stars had risen. It was not In silence, though we did not seem to break The hush with our low voices; but our thoughts Stirred deeply at their sources; and when night Divided us, I slumbered with a peace Floating about my heart, which only comes From high communion. I shall never see That silver moon again without a crowd Of gentle memories, and a silent prayer, That when the night of life shall oversteal Your sky, ye lovely sisters! there may be A light as beautiful to lead you on. THE TABLE OF EMERALD. Deep, it is said, under yonder pyramid, has for ages lain concealed the Table of Emerald, on which the thrice-great Hermes engraved, before the flood, the secret of Alchemy that gives gold at will. Epicurean. That ‘Emerald Green of the Pyramid’— Were I where it is laid, I'd ask no king for his heavy crown, As its hidden words were said. The pomp and the glitter of worldly pride Should fetter my moments not, And the natural thought of an open mind, Should govern alone my lot. Would I feast all day? revel all night? Laugh with a weary heart? Would I sleep away the breezy morn? And wake till the stars depart? Would I gain no knowledge, and search no deep For the wisdom that sages knew? Would I run to waste with a human mind— To its noble trust untrue? Oh! knew I the depth of that ‘Emerald Green,’ And knew I the spell of gold, I would never poison a fresh young heart With the taint of customs old. I would bind no wreath to my forehead free In whose shadow a thought would die, Nor drink from the cup of revelry, The ruin my gold would buy. But I'd break the fetters of care worn things, And be spirit and fancy free, My mind should go up where it longs to go, And the limitless wind outflee. I'd climb to the eyries of eagle men Till the stars became a scroll; And pour right on, like the even sea, In the strength of a governed soul. Ambition! Ambition! I've laughed to scorn Thy robe and thy gleaming sword; I would follow sooner a woman's eye, Or the spell of a gentle word; But come with the glory of human mind, And the light of the scholar's brow, And my heart shall be taught forgetfulness, And alone at thy altar bow. There was one dark eye—it hath passed away! There was one deep tone—'tis not! Could I see it now—could I hear it now, Ye were all too well forgot. My heart brought up, from its chambers deep, The sum of its earthly love; But it might not—could not—buy like Heaven, And she stole to her rest above. That first deep love I have taken back, In my rayless heart to hide; With the tear it brought for a burning seal, 'Twill there forever bide. I may stretch on now to a nobler ken, I may live in my thoughts of flame— The tie is broken that kept me back, And my spirit is on, for fame! But alas! I am dreaming as if I knew The spell of the tablet green; I forgot how like to a broken reed, Is the lot on which I lean. There is nothing true of my idle dream, But the wreck of my early love; And my mind is coined for my daily bread, And how can it soar above? LASSITUDE. I will throw by my book. The weariness Of too much study presses on my brain, And thought's close fetter binds upon my brow Like a distraction, and I must give o'er. Morning hath seen me here, and noon, and eve; And midnight with its deep and solemn hush Has look'd upon my labors, and the dawn, With its sweet voices, and its tempting breath Has driven me to rest—and I can bear The burden of such weariness no more. I have foregone society, and fled From a sweet sister's fondness, and from all A home's alluring blandishments, and now When I am thirsting for them, and my heart Would leap at the approaches of their kind And gentle offices, they are not here, And I must feel that I am all alone. Oh, for the fame of this forgetful world How much we suffer! Were it all for this— Were nothing but the empty praise of men The guerdon of this sedentary toil— Were this world's perishable honors all— I'd bound from its confinement as a hart Leaps from its hunters—but I know, that when My name shall be forgotten, and my frame Rests from its labors, I shall find above A work for the capacities I win, And, as I discipline my spirit here, My lyre shall have a nobler sweep in Heaven. ISABEL. They said that I was strange. I could not bear Confinement, and I lov'd to feel the wind Blowing upon my forehead, and when morn Came like an inspiration from the East, And the cool earth, awaking like a star In a new element, sent out its voice, And tempted me with music, and the breath Of a delicious perfume, and the dye Of the rich forests and the pastures green, To come out and be glad—I would not stay To bind my gushing spirit with a book. Fourteen bright summers—and my heart had grown Impatient in its loneliness, and yearn'd For something that was like itself, to love. She came—the stately Isabel—as proud And beautiful, and gentle as my dream; And with my wealth of feeling, lov'd I her. Older by years, and wiser of the world, She was in thought my equal, and we rang'd The pleasant wood together, and sat down Impassion'd with the same delicious sweep Of water, and I pour'd into her ear My passion and my hoarded thoughts like one, Till I forgot that there was any world But Isabel and nature. She was pleas'd And flatter'd with my wild and earnest love, And suffer'd my delirious words to burn Upon my lip unchided. It was new To be so worshipped like a deity By a pure heart from nature, and she gave Her tenderness its way, and when I kiss'd Her fingers till I thought I was in Heaven, She gaz'd upon me silently, and wept. I have seen eighteen summers—and the child Of stately Isabel hath learn'd to come And win me from my sadness. I have school'd My feelings to affection for that child, And I can see his father fondle him, And give him to his mother with a kiss Upon her holy forehead—and be calm! MERE ACCIDENT. It was a shady nook that I had found Deep in the greenwood. A delicious stream Ran softly by it on a bed of grass, And to the border leant a sloping bank Of moss as delicate as Tempe e'er Spread for the sleep of Io. Overhead The spreading larch was woven with the fir, And as the summer wind stole listlessly, And dallied with the tree tops, they would part And let in sprinklings of the sunny light, Studding the moss like silver; and again Returning to their places, there would come A murmur from the touched and stirring leaves, That like a far-off instrument, beguiled Your mood into the idleness of sleep. Here did I win thee, Viola! We came— Thou knowest how carelessly—and never thought Love lived in such a wilderness; and thou— I had a cousin's kindness for thy lip, And in the meshes of thy chesnut hair I loved to hide my fingers—that was all! And when I saw thy figure on the grass, And thy straw bonnet flung aside, I thought A fairy would be pretty, painted so Upon a ground of green—but that was all! And when thou playfully wouldst bathe thy foot, And the clear water of the stream ran off And left the white skin polished, why, I thought It looked like ivory—but that was all! And when thou wouldst be serious, and I Was serious too, and thy mere fairy's hand Lay carelessly in mine, and just for thought I mused upon thy innocence and gaz'd Upon the pure transparence of thy brow— I pressed thy fingers half unconsciously, And fell in love. Was that all, Viola? THE EARL'S MINSTREL. I had a passion when I was a child For a most pleasant idleness. In June, When the thick masses of the leaves were stirr'd With a just audible murmur, and the streams Fainted in their cool places to a low Unnotic'd tinkle, and the reapers hung Their sickles in the trees and went to sleep, Then might you find me in an antique chair Cushion'd with cunning luxury, which stood In the old study corner, by a nook Crowded with volumes of the old romance; And there, the long and quiet summer day, Lay I with half clos'd eyelids, turning o'er Leaf after leaf, until the twilight blurr'd Their singular and time-stain'd characters. 'Twas a forgetful lore, and it is blent With dreams that in my fitful slumber came, And is remember'd faintly. But to-day With the strange waywardness of human thought, A story has come back to me which I Had long forgotten, and I tell it now Because it hath a savour that I find But seldom in the temper of the world. Angelo turn'd away. He was a poor Unhonor'd minstrel, and he might not breathe Love to the daughter of an Earl. She rais'd Proudly her beautiful head, and shook away From her clear temples the luxuriant hair, And told him it would ever please her well To listen to his minstrelsy, but love Was for a loftier lip—and then the tear Stole to her flashing eye, for as she spoke There rose up a remembrance of his keen, Unstooping spirit, and his noble heart Given her like a sacrifice, and she held Her hand for him to kiss, and said, “Farewell! Think of me, Angelo!” and so pass'd on. The color to his forehead mounted high, And his thin lip curl'd haughtily, and then As if his mood had chang'd, he bow'd his head Low on his bosom, and remain'd awhile Lost in his bitter thoughts—and then again He lifted to its height his slender form, And his moist eye grew clear, and his hand pass'd Rapidly o'er his instrument while thus He gave his spirit voice:— It did not need that alter'd look, Nor that uplifted brow— I had not ask'd thy haughty love, Were I as proud as now. My love was like a beating heart— Unbidden and unstayed; And had I known but half its power, It had not been betray'd. I did not seek thy titled hand; I thought not of thy name; I only granted utterance To one wild thought of flame. I did not dream thou couldst be mine, Or I a thought to thee— I only knew my lip must let Some burning thought go free. I lov'd thee for thy high born grace, Thy deep and lustrous eye, For the sweet meaning of thy brow, And for thy bearing high; I lov'd thee for thy stainless truth, Thy thirst for higher things; For all that to our common lot A better temper brings— And are they not all thine? still thine? Is not thy heart as true? Holds not thy step its noble grace— Thy cheek its dainty hue? And have I not an ear to hear— A cloudless eye to see— And a thirst for beautiful human thought, That first was stirr'd with thee? Then why should I turn from thee now? Why should not I love on— Dreaming of thee by night, by day, As I have ever done? My service shall be still as leal, My love as quenchless burn— It shames me of my selfish thought That dream'd of a return! He married her! Perhaps it spoils the tale— But she had listen'd to his song, unseen, And kept it in her heart, and, by and by, When Angelo did service for his king, And was prefer'd to honor, she betray'd Her secret in some delicate way that I Do not remember, and so ends the tale. THE SERENADE. Innocent dreams be thine! The silver night Is a fit curtain for thy lovely sleep. The stars keep watch above thee, and the moon Sits like a brooding spirit up in Heaven, Ruling the night's deep influences, and life Hath a hushed pulse, and the suspended leaves Sleep with their whisperings as if the dew Were a soft finger on the lip of sound. Innocent dreams be thine! thy heart sends up Its thoughts of purity like pearly bells Rising in crystal fountains, and the sin That thou hast seen by day, will, like a shade, Pass from thy memory, as if the pure Had an unconscious ministry by night. Midnight—and now for music! Would I were A sound that I might steal upon thy dreams, And, like the breathing of my flute, distil Sweetly upon thy senses. Softly, boy! Breathe the low cadences as if the words Fainted upon thy lip—I would not break Her slumber quite—but only, as she dreams, Witch the lull'd sense till she believes she hears Celestial melody:— SONG. “Sleep, like a lover, woo thee, Isabel! And golden dreams come to thee, Like a spell By some sweet angel drawn! Noiseless hands shall seal thy slumber, Setting stars its moments number, So, sleep thou on! The night above thee broodeth, Hushed and deep; But no dark thought intrudeth On the sleep Which folds thy senses now. Gentle spirits float around thee, Gentle rest hath softly bound thee, For pure art thou! And now thy spirit fleeth On rare wings, And fancy's vision seeth Holy things In its high atmosphere. Music strange thy sense unsealeth, And a voice to thee revealeth What angels hear. Thou'lt wake when morning breaketh, Pure and calm; As one who mourns, awaketh When the balm Of peace hath on him fell. Purer thoughts shall stir within thee, Softer cords to virtue win thee— Farewell! Farewell!” APRIL. A violet by a mossy stone, Half hidden from the eye, Fair as a star, when only one, Is shining in the sky. Wordsworth I have found violets. April hath come on, And the cool winds feel softer, and the rain Falls in the beaded drops of summer time. You may hear birds at morning, and at eve The tame dove lingers till the twilight falls, Cooing upon the eaves, and drawing in His beautiful bright neck, and from the hills, A murmur like the hoarseness of the sea Tells the release of waters, and the earth Sends up a pleasant smell, and the dry leaves Are lifted by the grass—and so I know That Nature, with her delicate ear, hath heard The dropping of the velvet foot of Spring. Smell of my violets! I found them where The liquid South stole o'er them, on a bank That lean'd to running water. There's to me A daintiness about these early flowers That touches me like poetry. They blow With such a simple loveliness among The common herbs of pasture, and breathe out Their lives so unobtrusively, like hearts Whose beatings are too gentle for the world. I love to go in the capricious days Of April and hunt violets; when the rain Is in the blue cups trembling, and they nod So gracefully to the kisses of the wind. It may be deem'd unmanly, but the wise Read nature like the manuscript of heaven And call the flowers its poetry. Go out! Ye spirits of habitual unrest, And read it when the “fever of the world” Hath made your hearts impatient, and, if life Hath yet one spring unpoison'd, it will be Like a beguiling music to its flow, And you will no more wonder that I love To hunt for violets in the April time. TO A BRIDE. Pass thou on! for the vow is said That is never broken; The hand of blessing hath, trembling, laid On snowy forehead and simple braid, And the word is spoken By lips that never their words betray'd. Pass thou on! for thy human all Is richly given, And the voice that claim'd its holy thrall Must be sweeter for life than music's fall, And, this side Heaven, Thy lip may never that trust recal. Pass thou on! yet many an eye Will droop and glisten; And the hushing heart in vain will try To still its pulse as thy step goes by And we “vainly listen For thy voice of witching melody.” Pass thou on! yet a sister's tone In its sweetness lingers, Like some twin echo sent back alone, Or the bird's soft note when its mate hath flown, And a sister's fingers Will again o'er the thrilling harp be thrown. And our eyes will rest on their foreheads fair, And our hearts awaken Whenever we come where their voices are— But oh, we shall think how musical were, Ere of thee forsaken, The mingled voices we listed there. Pass on! there is not of our blessings one That may not perish— Like visiting angels whose errand is done, They are never at rest till their home is won, And we may not cherish The beautiful gift of thy light—Pass on! TWENTY-TWO. I'm twenty-two—I'm twenty-two— They gaily give me joy, As if I should be glad to hear That I was less a boy. They do not know how carelessly Their words have given pain, To one whose heart would leap to be A happy boy again. I had a light and careless heart When this brief year began, And then I pray'd that I might be A grave and perfect man. The world was like a blessed dream Of joyous coming years— I did not know its manliness Was but to wake in tears. A change has on my spirit come, I am forever sad; The light has all departed now My early feelings had; I used to love the morning grey, The twilight's quiet deep, But now like shadows on the sea, Upon my thoughts they creep. And love was like a holy star, When this brief year was young, And my whole worship of the sky On one sweet ray was flung; But worldly things have come between, And shut it from my sight, And though the star shines purely yet, I mourn its hidden light. And fame! I bent to it the knee, And bow'd to it my brow, And it is like a coal upon My living spirit now— But when I pray'd for burning fire To touch the soul I bow'd, I did not know the lightning flash Would come in such a cloud. Ye give me joy! Is it because Another year has fled?— That I am farther from my youth, And nearer to the dead? Is it because my cares have come?— My happy boyhood o'er?— Because the visions I have lov'd Will visit me no more? Oh, tell me not that ye are glad! I cannot smile it back; I've found no flower, and seen no light On manhood's weary track. My love is deep—ambition deep— And heart and mind will on— But love is fainting by the way, And fame consumes ere won. TO A SLEEPING BOY. Sleep on! Sleep on! beguiling The hours with happy rest. Sleep!—by that dreamy smiling, I know that thou art blest. Thy mother over thee hath leant To guard thee from annoy, And the angel of the innocent Was in that dream, my boy! The tinting of the summer rose Is on that pillowed cheek, And the quietness of summer thought Has made thy forehead meek. And yet that little ample brow, And arching lip, are fraught With pledges of high manliness, And promises of thought. Thy polished limbs are rounded out As is the Autumn fruit, And full and reedy is the voice That slumber hath made mute. And, looking on thy perfect form— Hearing thy pleasant tone— I almost weep for joy, my son, To know thee for my own. Sleep on! thine eye seems looking thro' The half transparent lid, As if its free and radiant glance Impatiently were hid; But ever as I kneel to pray, And in my fulness weep, I thank the Giver of my child For that pure gift of sleep— I half believe they take thee, then, Back to a better world again. And so, sleep on! If thou hast worn An angel's shining wing, The watch that I have loved to keep Hath been a blessed thing. And if thy spirit hath been here, With spotless thoughts alone— A mother's silent ministry Is still a holy one; And I will pray that there may be A shining wing in wait for thee. SONNET. WINTER. The frozen ground looks gray. 'Twill shut the snow Out from its bosom, and the flakes will fall Softly and lie upon it. The hushed flow Of the ice-covered waters, and the call Of the cold driver to his oxen slow, And the complaining of the gust, are all That I can hear of music—would that I With the green summer like a leaf might die? So will a man grow gray, and on his head The snow of years lie visibly, and so Will come a frost when his green years have fled, And his chilled pulses sluggishly will flow, And his deep voice be shaken—would that I In the green summer of my youth might die! SONNET. Beautiful ROBIN! with thy feathers red Contrasting sweetly with the soft green tree, Making thy little flights as thou art led By things that tempt a simple one like thee— I would that thou couldst warble me to tears As lightly as the birds of other years. Idly to lie beneath an April sun, Pressing the perfume from the tender grass; To watch a joyous rivulet leap on With the clear tinkle of a music glass, And as I saw the early robin pass, To hear him thro' his little compass run— Hath been a joy that I shall no more know Before I to my better portion go. SONNET. Exquisite Laura! with thy pouting lip, And the arch smile that makes me constant so— Tempting me still like a dull bee to sip The flower I should have left so long ago— Beautiful Laura! who art just so fair That I can think thee lovely when alone, And still art not so wonderfully rare That I could never find a prettier one— Spirited Laura! laughing, weeping, crying In the same breath, and gravest with the gay— So wild, that Cupid ever shoots thee flying, And knows his archery is thrown away— Inconstant as I am, I cannot yet Break thy sweet fetter, exquisite coquette! SONNET. There was a beautiful spirit in her air, As of a fay at revel. Hidden springs, Too delicate for knowledge, should be there, Moving her gently like invisible wings; And then her lip out-blushing the red fruit That bursts with ripeness in the Autumn time, And the arch eye you would not swear was mute, And the clear cheek, as of a purer clime, And the low tone, soft as a pleasant flute Sent over water with the vesper chime; And then her forehead with its loose, dark curl, And the bewildering smile that made her mouth Like a torn rose-leaf moistened of the South— She has an angel's gifts—the radiant girl! DISCRIMINATION. I used to love a radiant girl— Her lips were like a rose leaf torn; Her heart was as free as a floating curl, Or a breeze at morn; Her step as light as a Peri's daughter, And her eye as soft as gliding water. Witching thoughts like things half hid Lurk'd beneath her silken lashes, And a modest droop of the veined lid Oft hid their flashes— But to me the charm was more complete As the blush stole up its fringe to meet. Paint me love as a honey bee! Rosy mouths are things to sip; Nothing was ever so sweet to me As Marion's lip— Till I learned that a deeper magic lies In kissing the lids of her closed eyes. Her sweet brow I seldom touch, Save to part her raven hair; Her bright cheek I gaze on much, Her white hand is fair; But none of these—I've tried them all— Is like kissing her eyes as the lashes fall. A PORTRAIT. She was not very beautiful, if it be beauty's test To match a classic model when perfectly at rest; And she did not look bewitchingly, if witchery it be, To have a forehead and a lip transparent as the sea. The fashion of her gracefulness was not a follow'd rule, And her effervescent sprightliness was never learnt at school; And her words were all peculiar, like the fairy's who ‘spoke pearls;’ And her tone was ever sweetest midst the cadences of girls. Said I she was not beautiful? Her eyes upon your sight Broke with the lambent purity of planetary light, And an intellectual beauty, like a light within a vase, Touched every line with glory of her animated face. Her mind with sweets was laden, like a morning breath in June, And her thoughts awoke in harmony, like dreamings of a tune, And you heard her words like voices that o'er the waters creep, Or like a serenader's lute that mingles with your sleep. She had an earnest intellect—a perfect thirst of mind, And a heart by elevated thoughts and poetry refin'd, And she saw a subtle tint or shade with every careless look, And the hidden links of nature were familiar as a book. She's made of those rare elements that now and then appear, As if remov'd by accident unto a lesser sphere, Forever reaching up, and on, to life's sublimer things, As if they had been used to track the universe with wings. ON SEEING THROUGH A DISTANT WINDOW A BELLE COMPLETING HER TOILET FOR A BALL. 'Tis well—'tis well—that clustering shade Is on thy forehead sweetly laid; And that light curl that slumbers by Makes deeper yet thy depth of eye; And that white rose that decks thy hair Just wins the eye to linger there, Yet makes it not to note the less The beauty of that raven tress. Thy coral necklace?—ear-rings too? Nay—nay—not them—no darker hue Than thy white bosom be to-night On that fair neck the bar of light, Or hide the veins that faintly glow And wander in its living snow. What!—yet another? can it be That neck needs ornament to thee?— Yet not thy jewels!—they are bright, But that dark eye has softer light, And tho' each gem had been a star, Thy simple self were lovelier far— Yet stay!—that string of matchless pearl? Nay—wear it—wear it—radiant girl! For ocean's best of pure and white Should only be thy foil to night. Aye, turn thee round! 'tis lovely all— Thou'lt have no peer at that gay ball! And that proud toss!—it makes thee smile To see how deep is thine own wile; And that slow look that seems to stray As each sweet feature made it stay— And that small finger, lightly laid On dimpled cheek and glossy braid, As if to know that all they seem Is really there, and not a dream— I wish I knew the gentle thought By all this living beauty wrought! I wish I knew if that sweet brow, That neck on which thou gazest now— If thy rich lip and brilliant face— Thy perfect figure's breezy grace— If these are half the spell to thee That will, this night, bewilder me! TO A BELLE. All that thou art, I thrillingly And sensibly do feel; For my eye doth see, and my ear doth hear, And my heart is not of steel; I meet thee in the festal hall— I turn thee in the dance— And I wait, as would a worshipper, The giving of thy glance. Thy beauty is as undenied As the beauty of a star; And thy heart beats just as equally, Whate'er thy praises are; And so long without a parallel Thy loveliness hath shone, That, follow'd like the tided moon, Thou mov'st as calmly on. Thy worth I, for myself, have seen— I know that thou art leal; Leal to a woman's gentleness, And thine own spirit's weal; Thy thoughts are deeper than a dream, And holier than gay; And thy mind is a harp of gentle strings, Where angel fingers play. I know all this—I feel all this— And my heart believes it true; And my fancy hath often borne me on, As a lover's fancies do; And I have a heart, that is strong and deep, And would love with its human all, And it waits for a fetter that's sweet to wear, And would bound to a silken thrall. But it loves not thee.—It would sooner bind Its thoughts to the open sky; It would worship as soon a familiar star, That is bright to every eye. 'Twere to love the wind that is sweet to all— The wave of the beautiful sea— 'Twere to hope for all the light in Heaven, To hope for the love of thee. But wert thou lowly—yet leal as now; Rich but in thine own mind; Humble—in all but the queenly brow; And to thine own glory blind— Were the world to prove but a faithless thing, And worshippers leave thy shrine— My love were, then, but a gift for thee, And my strong deep heart were thine. A PORTRAIT. She's beautiful! Her raven curls Have broken hearts in envious girls— And then they sleep in contrast so, Like raven feathers upon snow, And bathe her neck—and shade the bright Dark eye from which they catch the light, As if their graceful loops were made To keep that glorious eye in shade, And holier make its tranquil spell, Like waters in a shaded well. I cannot rhyme about that eye— I've match'd it with a midnight sky— I've said 'twas deep, and dark, and wild, Expressive, liquid, witching, mild— But the jewell'd star, and the living air Have nothing in them half so fair. She's noble—noble—one to keep Embalm'd for dreams of fever'd sleep— An eye for nature—taste refin'd, Perception swift, and ballanc'd mind,— And more than all, a gift of thought To such a spirit-fineness wrought, That on my ear her language fell, As if each word dissolv'd a spell. Yet I half hate her. She has all That would ensure an angel's fall— But there's a cool collected look, As if her pulses beat by book— A measure'd tone, a cold reply, A management of voice and eye, A calm, possess'd, authentic air, That leaves a doubt of softness there, 'Till—look and worship as I may— My fever'd thoughts will pass away. And when she lifts her fringing lashes, And her dark eye like star-light flashes— And when she plays her quiet wile Of that calm look, and measur'd smile, I go away like one who's heard In some fine scene the prompter's word, And make a vow to break her chain, And keep it—till we meet again.</field>
