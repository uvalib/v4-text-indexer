      <field name="fulltext">âVERSEâ Poems Selected and Arranged by Adelaide Crapsey Part I Birth-Moment Behold her, Running through the waves, Eager to reach the land; The water laps her, Sun and wind are on her, Healthy, brine-drenched and young, Behold Desire new-born;â Desire on first fulfillment's radiant edge, Love at miraculous moment of emergence, This is she, Who running, Hastens, hastens to the land. Look.. Look.. Her blown gold hair and lucent eyes of youth, Her body rose and ivory in the sun.. Look, How she hastens, Running, running to the land. Her hands are yearning and her feet are swift To reach and hold She knows not what Yet knows that it is life; Need urges her, Self, uncomprehended but most deep divined, Unwilled but all-compelling, drives her on. Life runs to life. She who longs, But hath not yet accepted or bestowed, All virginal dear and bright, Runs, runs to reach the land. And she who runs shall be Married to blue of summer skies at noon, Companion to green fields, Held bride of subtle fragrance and of all sweet sound, BelovÃ¨d of the stars, And wanton mistress to the veering winds. Oh breathless space between: Womb-time just passed, Dark-hidden, chaotic-formative, unpersonal, And individual life of fresh-created force Not yet begun: One moment more Before desire shall meet desire And new creation start. Oh breathless space, While she, Just risen from the waves, Runs, runs to reach the land. (Ah, keenest personal moment When mouth unkissed turns eager-slow and tremulous Towards lover's mouth, That tremulous and eager-slow Droops down to it: But breathless space of breath or two Lies in between Before the mouth upturned and mouth down-drooped Shall meet and make the kiss.) Look.. Look.. She runs.. Love fresh-emerged, Desire new-born.. Blown on by wind, And shone on by the sun, She rises from the waves And running, Hastens, hastens to the land. BelovÃ¨d and BelovÃ¨d and BelovÃ¨d, Even so right And beautiful and undenied Is my desire; Even so longing-swift I run to your receiving arms. O Aphrodite! O Aphrodite, hear! Hear my wrung cry flame upward poignant-glad... This is my time for me. I too am young; I too am all of love! 1905. The Mother Exultant Joy! Joy! Joy! The hills are glad, The valleys re-echo with merriment, In my heart is the sound of laughter, And my feet dance to the time of it; Oh, little son, carried light on my shoulder, Let us go laughing and dancing through the live days, For this is the hour of the vintage, When man gathereth for himself the fruits of the vineyard. Look, little son, look: The grapes are translucent and ripe, They are heavy and fragrant with juice, They wait for the hands of the vintagers; For a long time the grapes were not, And were in the womb of the earth, Then out of the heavens came the rain, The sun sent down his warmth from the sky, At the touch of life, life stirred, And the earth brought forth her fruits in due season. I was a maid and alone, When, behold, there came to me a vision; My heart cried out within me, And the voice was the voice of God. Yea, a virgin I dreamed of love, And I was troubled and sore afraid, I wept and was glad, For the word of my heart named me blessÃ¨d, My soul exalted the might of creation. I was a maid and alone, When, behold, my lover came to me, My belovÃ¨d held me in his arms. Joy! Joy! Joy! Now is the vision fulfilled; I have conceived, I have carried in my womb, I have brought forth The life of the world; Out of my joy and my pain, Out of the fulness of my living Hath my son gained his life. Look, little son, look: The grapes are ripe for the gathering; The fresh, deep earth is in them, And clean water from the clouds. And golden, golden sun is in the heart of the grapes. Look, little son, look: The earth, your mother, And the touch of life who is your father, They have provided food for you That you also may live. The vineyards are planted on the hillside, They are the vineyards of my belovÃ¨d, He chose a favorable spot, His hands prepared the soil for the planting; He set out the young vines And cared for them till the time of their bearing. Now is his labour fulfilled who worked with God. The fruit of the vineyard is ripe, The vintagers laugh in the sun, They sing while they gather the grapes, For the vintage is a good one, The wine vats are pressed down and running over. Joy! Joy! Joy! Now is the wonder accomplished; Out of the heart of the living grape Hath the hand of my belovÃ¨d Wrung the wine of the dream of life. BelovÃ¨d, My little son's father, Together we have given life, And the vision of life; Shall we not rejoice Who have made eternal The days of our living. Look, little son, look: The grapes glow with rich juice; The juice of the grape hath in it The substance of the earth, And the air's breath; It hath in it the soul of the vintage. Put forth your hand, little son, And take for yourself the life That your father and your mother Have provided for you. Joy! Joy! Joy! The hills are glad, The valleys re-echo with merriment, In my heart is the sound of laughter, And my feet dance to the time of it; Oh, little son, carried light on my shoulder, Let us go laughing and dancing through the live days, For this is the hour of the vintage, When man gathereth for himself the fruits of the vineyard. 1905. John Keats (February 1820-February 1821) Meet thou the event And terrible happening of Thine end: for thou art come Upon the remote, cold place Of ultimate dissolution and With dumb, wide look Thou, impotent, dost feel Impotence creeping on Thy potent soul. Yea, now, caught in The aghast and voiceless pain Of death, thyself doth watch Thyself becoming naught. Peace.. Peace.. for at The last is comfort. Lo, now Thou hast no pain. Lo, now The waited presence is Within the room; the voice Speaks final-gentle: âChild, Even thy careful nurse, I lift thee in my arms For greater ease and while Thy heart still beats, place my Cool fingers of oblivion on Thine eyes and close them for Eternity. Thou shalt Pass sleeping, nor know When sleeping ceases. Yet still A little while thy breathing lasts, Gradual is faint and fainter; I Must listen closeâthe end.â Rest. And you others.. All. Grave-fellows in Green place. Here grows Memorial every spring's Fresh grass and here Your marking monument Was built for you long, long Ago when Caius Cestius died. Rome 1909. Cinquains 1911â1913 November Night Listen.. With faint dry sound, Like steps of passing ghosts, The leaves, frost-crisp'd, break from the trees And fall. Release With swift Great sweep of her Magnificent arm my pain Clanged back the doors that shut my soul From life. Triad These be Three silent things: The falling snow.. the hour Before the dawn.. the mouth of one Just dead. Snow Look up... From bleakening hills Blows down the light, first breath Of wintry wind... look up, and scent The snow! Anguish Keep thou Thy tearless watch All night but when blue dawn Breathes on the silver moon, then weep! Then weep! Trapped Well and If day on day Follows, and weary year On year.. and ever days and years.. Well? Moon-shadows Still as On windless nights The moon-cast shadows are, So still will be my heart when I Am dead. Susanna And The Elders âWhy do You thus devise Evil against her?â âFor that She is beautiful, delicate: Therefore.â Youth But me They cannot touch, Old age and death.. the strange And ignominious end of old Dead folk! Languor After Pain Pain ebbs, And like cool balm, An opiate weariness Settles on eye-lids, on relaxed Pale wrists. The Guarded Wound If it Were lighter touch Than petal of flower resting On grass oh still too heavy it were, Too heavy! Winter The cold With steely clutch Grips all the land.. alack, The little people in the hills Will die! Night Winds The old Old winds that blew When chaos was, what do They tell the clattered trees that I Should weep? Arbutus Not spring's Thou art, but hers, Most cool, most virginal, Winter's, with thy faint breath, thy snows Rose-tinged. Roma Aeterna The sun Is warm to-day, O Romulus, and on Thine olden Palatine the birds Still sing. [Not thou] âHe's killed the may and he's laid her by To bear the red rose company.â Not thou, White rose, but thy Ensanguined sister is The dear companion of my heart's Shed blood. Amaze I know Not these my hands And yet I think there was A woman like me once had hands Like these. Shadow A-sway, On red rose, A golden butterfly.. And on my heart a butterfly Night-wing'd. Fate Defied As it Were tissue of silver I'll wear, O Fate, thy grey, And go mistily radiant, clad Like the moon. Madness Burdock, Blue aconite, And thistle and thorn.. of these, Singing I wreathe my pretty wreath O'death. The Warning Just now, Out of the strange Still dusk.. as strange, as still.. A white moth flew. Why am I grown So cold? Saying of Il Haboul Guardian Of The Treasure Of Solomon And Keeper Of The Prophet's Armour My tent A vapour that The wind dispels and but As dust before the wind am I Myself. The Death Of Holofernes Israel! Wake! Be gay! Thine enemy is brought lowâ Thy foe slainâby the hand, by the hand Of a woman! Laurel In the Berkshires Sea-foam And coral! Oh, I'll Climb the great pasture rocks And dream me mermaid in the sun's Gold flood. Niagara Seen on a night in November How frail Above the bulk Of crashing water hangs, Autumnal, evanescent, wan, The moon. The Grand Canyon By Zeus! Shout word of this To the eldest dead! Titans, Gods, Heroes, come who have once more A home! Now Barabbas Was A Robber No guile? Nay, but so strangely He moves among us.. Not this Man but Barabbas! Release to us Barabbas! Refuge In Darkness With night's Dim veil and blue I will cover my eyes, I will bind close my eyes that are So weary. Part II To Walter Savage Landor Ah, Walter, where you lived I rue These days come all too late for me; What matter if her eyes are blue Whose rival is Persephone? Fiesole, 1909. The Pledge White doves of Cytherea, by your quest Across the blue Heaven's bluest highest air, And by your certain homing to Love's breast, Still to be true and ever trueâI swear. Hypnos, God of Sleep The shadowy boy of night Crosses the dusking land; He sows his poppy-seeds With steady, gentle hand. The shadowy boy of night Young husbandman of dreams, Garners his gracious blooms By far and moonlit streams. Expenses Little my lacking fortunes show For this to eat and that to wear; Yet laughing, Soul, and gaily go! An obol pays the Stygian fare. London, 1910 Adventure Sun and wind and beat of sea, Great lands stretching endlessly... Where be bonds to bind the free? All the world was made for me! On Seeing Weather-Beaten Trees Is it as plainly in our living shown, By slant and twist, which way the wind hath blown? Warning To The Mighty Ere the hornÃ¨d owl hoot Once and twice and thrice there shall Go among the blind brown worms News of thy great burial; When the pomp is passed away, âHere's a King,â the worms shall say. Oh, Lady, Let The Sad Tears Fall Oh, Lady, let the sad tears fall To speak thy pain, Gently as through the silver dusk The silver rain. Oh, let thy bosom breathe its grief In such soft sigh As hath the wind in gardens where Pale roses die. Dirge Never the nightingale, Oh, my dear, Never again the lark Thou wilt hear; Though dusk and the morning still Tap at thy window-sill, Though ever love call and call Thou wilt not hear at all, My dear, my dear. The Sun-Dial Every day, Every day, Tell the hours By their shadows, By their shadows. The Entombment In a cave born, (Mary said) In a cave is My Son buriÃ¨d. Autumn Fugitive, wistful, Pausing at edge of her going, Autumn, the maiden, turns, Leans to the earth with ineffable Gesture. Ah, more than Spring's skies her skies shine Tender and frailer Bloom than plum-bloom or almond Lies on her hillsides, her fields, Misted, faint-flushing. Ah, lovelier Is her refusal than Yielding who pauses with grave Backward smiling, with light Unforgettable touch of Fingers withdrawn... Pauses, lo Vanishes.. fugitive, wistful... Ah me.. Alas.. (He) Ah me, my love's heart, Like some frail flower, apart, High, on the cliff's edge growing, Touched by unhindered sun to sweeter showing, Swung by each faint wind's faintest blowing, But so, on the cliff's edge growing, From man's reach aloof, apart: Ah me, my love's heart! (She) Alack, alas, my lover, As one who would discover At world's end his path, Nor knows at all what faÃ«ry way he hath Who turneth dreaming into faith And followeth that near path His own heart dareth to discover: Alack, alas, my lover! Perfume of Youth (Girl's Song) In Babylon, in Nineveh, And long ago, and far away, The lilies and the lotus blew That are my sweet of youth to-day. From those high gardens of the Gods That eyes of men may never see, The amaranth and asphodel Immortal odours shed on me. In vial of my early years, As in a crystal vial held, What precious fragrance treasured up Of age and agelessness distill'd. Thine but to give. Give straightway all. Yea, straight, mine hands, the ointment rare In great libation joyous pour! Oh, look of youth... Oh, golden hair... Rapunzel All day, all day I brush My golden strands of hair; All day I wait and wait.. Ah, who is there? Who calls? Who calls? The gold Ladder of my long hair I loose and wait.. and wait.. Ah, who is there? She left at dawn.. I am blind In the tangle of my long hair.. Is it she? the witch? the witch? Ah, who is there? Narcissus âBoy, lying Where the long grass Edges the pool's brim, What do you watch There in the water? the blue Colour of Heaven Mirrored, repeated? the brown Tree-trunks and branches Waveringly imaged? These, Boy, do you watch?â âNay but mine eyes; Nay but the trouble Deep in mine eyes.â Vendor's Song My songs to sell, good sir! I pray you buy. Here's one will win a lady's tears, Here's one will make her gay, Here's one will charm your true love true Forever and a day; Good sir, I pray you buy! Oh, no, he will not buy. My songs to sell, sweet maid! I pray you buy. This one will teach you Lilith's lore, And this what Helen knew, And this will keep your gold hair gold, And this your blue eyes blue; Sweet maid, I pray you buy! Oh, no, she will not buy. If I'd as much money as I could tell, I never would cry my songs to sell, I never would cry my songs to sell. AVIS Avis, the fair, at dawn Rose lightly from her bed, Herself arrayed, Avis, the fair, the maid, In vestiment of lawn; Across the fields she sped, Five flowerets there she found, In fragrant garland wound, Avis, the fair, at dawn, Five roses red. Go thou from thence of thy pity! Thou lov'st not me. Doom Peter stands by the gate, And Michael by the throne. âPeter, I would pass the gate And come before the throne.â âWhose spirit prayed never at the gate In life nor at the throne, In death he may not pass the gate To come before the throne:â Peter said from the gate; Said Michael from the throne. Grain Field Scarlet the poppies Blue the corn-flowers, Golden the wheat. Gold for the Eternal: Blue for Our Lady: Red for the five Wounds of her Son. Song I make my shroud but no one knows, So shimmering fine it is and fair, With stitches set in even rows. I make my shroud but no one knows. In door-way where the lilac blows, Humming a little wandering air, I make my shroud and no one knows, So shimmering fine it is and fair. Pierrot For Aubrey Beardsley's picture âPierrot is dying.â Pierrot is dying; Tiptoe in, Finger touched to lip, Harlequin, Columbine and Clown. Hush! how still he lies In his bed, White slipped hand and white Sunken head. Oh, poor Pierrot. There's his dressing-gown Across the chair, Slippers on the floor... Can he hear Us who tiptoe in? Pillowed high he lies In his bed; Listen, Columbine. âHe is dead.â Oh, poor Pierrot. The Monk In The Garden He comes from Mass early in the morning The sky's the very blue Madonna wears; The air's alive with gold! Mark you the way The birds sing and the dusted shimmer of dew On leaf and fruit?.. Per Bacco, what a day! The Mourner I have no heart for noon-tide and the sun, But I will take me where more tender night Shakes, fold on fold, her dewy darkness down, And shelters me that I may weep in peace, And feel no pitying eyes, and hear no voice Attempt my grief in comfort's alien tongue. Where cypresses, more black than night is black, Border straight paths, or where, on hillside slopes, The dim grey glimmer of the olive trees Lies like a breath, a ghost, upon the dark, There will I wander when the nightingale Ceases, and even the veilÃ¨d stars withdraw Their tremulous light, there find myself at rest, A silence and a shadow in the gloom. But all the dead of all the world shall know The pacing of my sable-sandall'd feet, And know my tear-drenched veil along the grass, And think them less forsaken in their graves, Saying: There's one remembers, one still mourns; For the forgotten dead are dead indeed. Night I have minded me Of the noon-day brightness, And the crickets' drowsy Singing in the sunshine. I have minded me Of the slim marsh-grasses That the winds at twilight, Dying, scarcely ripple.. And I cannot sleep. I have minded me Of a lily-pond, Where the waters sway All the moonlit leaves And the curled long stems.. And I cannot sleep. Harvesters' Song Reap, reap the grain and gather The sweet grapes from the vine; Our Lord's mother is weeping, She hath nor bread nor wine; She is weeping, The Queen of Heaven, She hath nor bread nor wine. ROSE-MARY OF THE ANGELS Little Sister Rose-Marie, Will thy feet as willing-light Run through Paradise, I wonder, As they run the blue skies under, Willing feet, so airy-light? Little Sister Rose-Marie, Will thy voice as bird-note clear Lift and ripple over Heaven As its mortal sound is given, Swift bird-voice, so young and clear? How God will be glad of thee, Little Sister Rose-Marie! AngÃ©lique Have you seen AngÃ©lique, What way she went? A white robe she wore; A flickering light near spent Her pale hand bore. Have you seen AngÃ©lique? Will she know the place Dead feet must find, The grave-cloth on her face To make her blind? Have you seen AngÃ©lique.. At night I hear her moan, And I shiver in my bed; She wanders all alone, She cannot find the dead. Chimes (1) The rose new-opening saith, And the dew of the morning saith, (Fallen leaves and vanished dew) Remember death.

I may not leap or run; I may nor laugh nor sing. âThy cell is small,â they say, âBe still thou captived thing.â But in the dusk of the night, Too sudden-swift to see, Closing and ivory gates Are refuge unto me. My griefs, my tears must watch, And cold the watch they keep; They whisper, whisper thereâ I hear them in my sleep. They know that I must come, And patient watch they keep, Whispering, shivering there, Till I come back from sleep. But in the dark of a night, Too dark for them to see, The refuge of black gates Will open unto me. Whisper up there in the dark.. Shiver by bleak winds stung.. My dead lips laugh to hear How long you wait... how long! Grey gaolers are my griefs That will not let me free; The bitterness of tears Is warder unto me. The Witch When I was girl by Nilus stream I watched the desert stars arise; My lover, he who dreamed the Sphinx, Learned all his dreaming from my eyes. I bore in Greece a burning name, And I have been in Italy Madonna to a painter-lad, And mistress to a Medici. And have you heard (and I have heard) Of puzzled men with decorous mien, Who judgedâThe wench knows far too muchâ And burnt her on the Salem green? Cry Of The Nymph To Eros Hear thou my lamentatÃ¯on, Eros, Aphrodite's son! My heart is broken and my days are done. Where the woods are dark and the stream runs clear in the dark, Eros! I prayed to thy mother and planted the seeds of her flowers, And smiled at the planting and wept at the planting. Oh, violets, Ye are dead and your whiteness, your sweetness, availed not. Thy mother Is cruel. Her flowers lie dead at the steps of her altar, Eros! Eros! With a shining like silver they cut through the blue of the sky Eros! The dove's wings, the white doves I brought to thy mother in worship; And I said, she will laugh for joy of my doves. Oh, stillness Of dead wings. She laughed not nor looked. My doves are dead, Are dead at the steps of her altar. Thy mother is cruel, Eros, Eros! Hear thou my lamentatÃ¯on, Eros, Aphrodite's son! My heart is broken and my days are done. Cradle-Song Madonna, Madonnina Sat by the grey road-side, Saint Joseph her beside, And Our Lord at her breast; Oh they were fain to rest, Mary and Joseph and Jesus, All by the grey road-side. She said, Madonna Mary, âI am thirsty, Joseph, and weary, All in the desert wide.â Then bent a tall palm-tree Its branches low to her knee; âBehold,â the palm-tree said, âMy fruit that is drink and bread.â So were they satisfied, Mary and Joseph and Jesus, All by the grey road-side. From Herod they were fled Over the desert wide, Mary and Joseph and Jesus, In Egypt to abide: Mary and Joseph and Jesus, In Egypt to abide. The blessÃ¨d Queen of Heaven Her own dear Son hath given For my son's sake; his sleep Is safe and sweet and deep. Lully.. Lulley.. So may you sleep alway, My baby, my dear son: Amen, Amen, Amen. My baby, my dear son. To Man Who Goes Seeking Immortality Bidding Him Look Nearer Home. Too far afield thy search. Nay, turn. Nay, turn. At thine own elbow potent Memory stands, Thy double, and eternity is cupped In the pale hollow of those ghostly hands. The Lonely Death In the cold I will rise, I will bathe In waters of ice; myself Will shiver, and shrive myself, Alone in the dawn, and anoint Forehead and feet and hands; I will shutter the windows from light, I will place in their sockets the four Tall candles and set them a-flame In the grey of the dawn; and myself Will lay myself straight in my bed, And draw the sheet under my chin. Lo, All The Way Lo, all the way, Look you, I said, the clouds will break, the sky Grow clear, the road Be easier for my travelling, the fields, So sodden and dead, Will shimmer with new green and starry bloom, And there will be, There will be then, with all serene and fair, Some little while For some light laughter in the sun; and lo, The journey's end, Grey road, grey fields, wind and a bitter rain. The Crucifixion And the centurion who stood by said: Truly this was a son of God. Not long ago but everywhere I go There is a hill and a black windy sky. Portent of hill, sky, day's eclipse I know; Hill, sky, the shuddering darkness, these am I. The dying at His right hand, at His left, I amâthe thief redeemed and the lost thief; I am the careless folk; I those bereft, The Well-Belov'd, the women bowed in grief. The gathering Presence that in terror cried, In earth's shock, in the Temple's veil rent through, I; and a watcher, ignorant, curious-eyed, I the centurion who heard and knew.

      <field name="fulltext">ADDITIONAL POEMS I To The Dead In The Grave-Yard Under My Window:âWritten in A Moment of Exasperation How can you lie so still? All day I watch And never a blade of all the green sod moves To show where restlessly you toss and turn, And fling a desperate arm or draw up knees Stiffened and aching from their long disuse; I watch all night and not one ghost comes forth To take its freedom of the midnight hour. Oh, have you no rebellion in your bones? The very worms must scorn you where you lie, A pallid mouldering acquiescent folk, Meek habitants of unresented graves. Why are you there in your straight row on row Where I must ever see you from my bed That in your mere dumb presence iterate The text so weary in my ears: âLie still And rest; be patient and lie still and rest.â I'll not be patient! I will not lie still! There is a brown road runs between the pines, And further on the purple woodlands lie, And still beyond blue mountains lift and loom; And I would walk the road and I would be Deep in the wooded shade and I would reach The windy mountain tops that touch the clouds. My eyes may follow but my feet are held. Recumbent as you others must I too Submit? Be mimic of your movelessness With pillow and counterpane for stone and sod? And if the many sayings of the wise Teach of submission I will not submit But with a spirit all unreconciled Flash an unquenched defiance to the stars. Better it is to walk, to run, to dance, Better it is to laugh and leap and sing, To know the open skies of dawn and night, To move untrammel'd down the flaming noon, And I will clamour it through weary days Keeping the edge of deprivation sharp, Nor with the pliant speaking on my lips Of resignation, sister to defeat. I'll not be patient. I will not lie still. And in ironic quietude who is The despot of our days and lord of dust Needs but, scarce heeding, wait to drop Grim casual comment on rebellion's end: âYes; yes ... Wilful and petulant but now As dead and quiet as the others are.â And this each body and ghost of you hath heard That in your graves do therefore lie so still. Saranac LakeâNovemberâ1913 To an Unfaithful Lover What words Are left thee then Who hast squandered on thy Forgetfulness eternity's I love? To A Hermit Thrush Art thou Not kin to him Who loved Mark's wife and both Died for it? O, thou harper in Green woods?

And what your spinstry weaves I'll forthwith wear And if it clothe me for the day or death's no air. The Companions Three grey women walk with me Fate and Grief and Memory. My fate brought grief; my grief must be With me through Eternity, Such thy power, memory. Three grey women walk with me. Epigram If illness' end be health regained then I Will pay you, Asculapeus, when I die. You Nor I Nor Nobody Knows You nor I nor nobody knows Where our daily-taken breath Vanisheth and vanisheth: Where our lost breath's flying goes You nor I nor nobody knows. The Proud Poet Great Kings were dust and all their deeds forgot Did my harp's taut and burnished strings stand mute; The fragrance of dead ladies' lovely names Blew never down the wind but for my lute. The Plaint Musicians O Musicians: Heartsease Heartsease; an you will have me live play heartsease. Light wind in the small green leaves Play, oh play, my sad heart ease; Birds, shake from your wilding throats TunÃ¨d charm of happy notes; Shepherd, shepherd, pipe a shrill A jocound pipe o'er vale and hill; For from too much weeping I, Maid forlorn, am like to die. Endymion. âLet me be young,â the Latmian shepherd prayed, âAnd let me have on night-time hills long sleep;â Whom she of Cynthus saw, Heaven's crownÃ©d maid, And gave his youth and dreams her love to keep.

Tears. The immemorial grief of all years Burdens my heart sorely, and the tears Of slow eternal crying stain my cheeks. Forever and forever my soul speaks Saying: I am thy self: Look on meâ And weep. Never and never shalt thou be As I. Weep; for weeping and hard pain Of loss measure joy of last visioned gain. John-a-dreamsâ A laggard in the rear of time's swift feet, And one who loiters on an aimless way Through lands he knows not; lured by birds to stray In secret paths where silence holds the beat And rustle of ascending wings. Roads meet; He turns by hazard of some far-glimpsed spray Of blossoming tree. Shall condemnation say, Unprofitable! Empty thy days as fleet? Nay, if perchance he wanders Paradise, And in unhurried immortality, Treads child-like wise and ignorant the thrice Blessed, ultimate regions of the throne of God? Then needs he not to fear who walks the sod Of Heaven in angels' radiant company. Incantation. O mia Luna! Porta mi fortuna! (You must say it nine times, curtseying, and then wish.) In rose-pale, fading blue of twilight sky, See, the new moon's thin crescent shining clear; Nine times I'll curtsey murmuring mystic words,â And wish good fortune to our love, my dear. Milking Time Heard ye the maidens Went through the meadows, Early, O, early, While yet the dew was Wet on the grass? Heard ye the milk-maids Singing and singing? âCushy cow bonny let down your milk, And I will give you a gown of silk, A gown of silk and a silver tee, If you will let down your milk to me.â Hear ye the maidens, Over the meadows, Where the dew gathers, Where shadows lengthen, Hear ye the milk-maids' Aery, hushed voices Singing, ah, singing? âCushy cow bonny let down your milk, And I will give you a gown of silk, A gown of silk and a silver tee, If you will let down your milk to me.â Morning and evening, In the green meadows Hear ye the milk-maids And their sweet singing? The Fiddler âThere'll be no roof to shelter you; You'll have no where to lay your head. And who will get your food for you? Star-dust pays for no man's bread. So, Jacky, come give me your fiddle If ever you mean to thrive.â âI'll have the skies to shelter me, The green grass it shall be my bed, And happen I'll find some where for me A sup of drink, a bite of bread; And I'll not give my fiddle To any man alive.â And it's out he went across the wold, His fiddle tucked beneath his chin, And (golden bow on silver strings) Smiling he fiddled the twilight in; And fiddled in the frosty moon, And all the stars of the Milky Way, And fiddled low through the dark o' dawn, And laughed and fiddled in the day. But oh, he had nor bite nor sup, And oh, the winds blew stark and cold, And when he dropped on his grass-green bed It's long he slept on the open wold. They digged his grave and âThere,â they said, âHe's got more land than ever he had, And well it will keep him held and housed, The feckless bit of a fiddling lad.â And it's out he's stepped across the wold His fiddle tucked beneath his chinâ A wavering shape in the wavering light, Smiling he fiddles the twilight in, And fiddles in the frosty moon, And all the stars of the Milky Way, And fiddles low through the dark o' dawn, And laughs and fiddles in the day. He needeth not or bite or sup, The winds of night he need not fear, And (bow of gold on silver strings) It's all the people turn to hear. âOh, never,â it's all the people cry, âCame such sweet sounds from mortal hand;â And âListen,â they say, âIt's some ghostly boy That goes a-fiddling through the land. Heark you! It's night comes slipping in,â The moon and the stars that tread the sky; And there's the breath o' the world that stops; And now with a shout the sun comes by!â Who heareth him he heedeth not But smiles content, the fiddling-lad; âIt's many and many a happy day,â He says, âMy fiddle and I have had; And I'll not give my fiddle To any man alive.â Aubade. The morning is new and the skies are fresh washed with light, The day cometh in with the sun and I awake laughing. Hasten, belovÃ¨d! For see, while you were yet sleeping The cool and virgin feet of dawn went soundless over grey meadows, And the earth is requickened under her touch. The vision that came with gradual steps departeth in an instant; Hasten, lest it be unbeheld of your eyes. The Parting. Was it love breathed on us as on the skies Dawn breathes for a short space and then is fled; Or loved we never at all who but misread With too dim vision the guarded mysteries? Were we unfaithful or were we unwise, Knew we not love, or if our love is dead, If such were true, for grace of what is sped, Could we not part with unaverted eyes? But whence these looks askance as at strange fears? And whence the far and muffled cryings that beat Across the moment of our dire farewell? Is here of sentience the dread burial? Is it a still quick love that hear, oh hears, The last earth fall, the sound of vanishing feet? As I Went As I went, as I went, Over the mountains, I heard, I heard, Through cloud-wreath and mist, A hound that was bayingâ Death .. it was death. As I went, as I went Over the meadows, I heard, I heard, From thicket, from shadow, A hidden bird flutingâ Death .. it was death. As I went, as I went By rocks and by sand-dunes, I heard, I heard, At the sea's bottom A silver fish swimmingâ Death .. it was death. As I went, as I went In my house, in my house, I heard, I heard, A footfall, a footfall Closely behind meâ Death .. it is death ..</field>

The Song of Choice. The maiden sat enthroned on the throne of her maidenhood: There were two lovers that came to her to win her, And one lover brought gift of red poppies, And the other carried a sheaf of white poppies in his arms. And one lover said: I bring you gift of red poppies: Your hair is golden and long, Your hair is soft as cast shadows, Your hair is as the path of the sun's light on the sea. Make for yourself a wreath of red poppies For the adorning of your golden hair. And the other saith: I bring you white poppies: They are white as the still white thought of holiness That stirred in your soul when you awoke alone at dawn. And the maiden rejoiced in her hair that was golden. And one lover said: Your eyes are as wells of darkling light And your mouth is as wine-stains: Let the red of my poppies gladden your eyes, Take my red poppies in your hands And lift them up for the kisses of your red, red mouth. And the other saith: I bring you white poppies: They are white as the still white thought of holiness That stirred in your soul when you awoke alone at dawn. And the maiden rejoiced that her eyes were as wells of light and her mouth as crimson wine-stains. And one lover said: Hold my red poppies between your breasts. Your breasts are lovely and white And colour against colour it shall be as blood upon snow; Your breasts shall be rosily overcast With the light of the poppies between them. And the other saith: I bring you white poppies: They are white as the still white thought of holiness That stirred in your soul when you awoke alone at dawn. And the maiden rejoiced in her breasts that were lovely and white; She longed for the red poppies to hold them between her breasts. And one lover said: Your blood is red and your heart is red And the poppies of my offering are a fine, keen scarlet. The maiden arose and stepped down from her throne. She reached forth her hands to take the heart-red poppies, She stretched out her hands for the poppies that were red as blood; Whenas she felt as it were a great rending within her And faltering she stood in trouble between her lovers. And one lover said: It is your pleasure that cries out in you to be accomplish'd. And the other saith: Oh, sweet, I know your pain. Behold the maiden hath chosen a lover: She hath stepped down from her throne, She hath found her a dwelling in the heart of her lover: He holds her in his arms: He stoops to kiss the sleeve of her garment that is white as the wings of white doves. Behond the maiden hath chosen a lover: She hath woven for herself a bride-wreath of white poppies, She hath given herself into the arms of him that knows her, And the maiden and her love are content. The Two Mothers The evening before the serpent came, Just at the hour of the Angelus, âBody o'me what thing is this,â Said Eve, sighed Eve, âThat if I be merry and glad, Or if I be sorry and sad, I cannot tell;ââand a strange sweet name, The evening before the serpent came, Whispered and cried in the heart of Eve. All alone in Eden's bowers, Eve went gathering Mary's flowers. The evening before the serpent came, Just at the first hour of the night, She reached a flagon of crystal bright, Sweet Eve, Young Eve, Snow-white, rose-red, a twi-forked flame, The evening before the serpent came, Kindled and burnt in the heart of Eve. âWhere have you been, my bride, my bride?â âThrough the garden's dusk to the sealÃ¨d well 'Neath the green hillside.â âWhat did you see, my wife, my wife?â âA little white dove in the silvern leaves Of the Tree of Life.â Oh dew! Oh tears! in Eden's bowers Fell sweet, fell bitter on Mary's flowers. The Expulsion Adam, thou banished man, Who may not come again, From thy lost Eden, Thy loved Garden, What wilt thou take, What wilt thou take with thee? These will I take These will I take with me: Odours of cinnamon Of spikenard of saffron Dooms-Day With terror and delight I meditate Thine eyes That must, all-seeing, just, My doings scrutinize. [I offer my self to you as cool water in cup of crystal] I offer my self to you as cool water in cup of crystal, So, sweetly fulfilling the needs of thy body For thou must drink water or die. I offer myself as wine graciously held in golden goblet A subtle drink of fireâ Thy soul hath need of this to live. Between us two no thanks save knowledge that the gift is life to both: Were it not sin and bitter waste that thou should die thirstyâ Or poured wine and water lie undrunk? Evil. In place secluded from the skies A silent woman with strange eyes Hiddenly waiting sits alone Upon a royal-massive throne Of smoothly polished malachite; An emeraldine curious light Fills all the place and through its chill Sapphired pale glow, arrested still, Unpalpitant as heart of death, I watch her soft-drawn patient breath... I will go creeping softly in Her eyes are promises of sin. La Morte Vision of vice grown old, Harlot with wisped grey hair Streaked drab and green Where once was false gold's sheen, Slack chin, rough wrinkled cheeks, lips bloodless cold, Going at mid-day through the city streets In hideous slattern guise; She whose whole business was to show her body's sweets Alluringly, indifferent leaves her ugliness unobscured. And yet look long and secretly.. Doth there not emanate from where She is a strange concentrate glow? Doth not the air about her show A dove-throat iridescence copper-blue? .. beauty mysteriously Present in scum blurred thin on stagnant ill-odoured pond? Corpse-light of lust.. desire's fixed death-filmed eyes. Still ghost of touch once live and eager-fond.. Who kissed her pale stale lips would kiss ten thousand thousand kisses sepulchered. Girl Fleeing Love Bridget! Saint Bride! Whither shall I go Lest my red cheeks show, Lest my cheeks sudden-pale Cry aloud, a tale I am fain to hide; That my heart not know Its own secret oh! Whither shall I go? Bridget! Saint Bride! [It's oh, my dear, the sun shines clear] It's oh, my dear, the sun shines clear, And the white road's fair to see; And it's will you follow by hill and hollow The long white road with me? It's love, my dear; it's joy, my dear, Oh it's life calls, sweet and free:â By hill and hollow, oh will you follow The long white road with me? What is to fear when skies are clear And lover and lass are we? Then, dear, ah follow, by hill and hollow The long white road with me! Clotilda Sings What is the bitter song that young Clotilda sings and works all day, And will not go where lad and lass Are met in joyous village play? Oh, young Clotilda sings, how clear How high and sweet for all to hear,â Blossoming plum and cherry, Flowering apple and quince, In springtime I was merry, I've learned weeping since, Bitter weeping since. Her baby at her woeful breast, Clotilda sings who hath no rest. Journey's End. The sea swings out, the sea swings in, The grey gulls fly afar, Each sun-beam catches a crested wave Like the gleam of a separate star. She looks to East, she looks to West, She laughs in the wind and sun; âHe sailed for a year and a day,â she saith, âAnd this time is almost done;â âHe has found the gold and the shining gems, He is bringing them home to me. Oh long-winged gulls, have you seen his ship? Where is he, oh swaying sea?â The gulls fly grey across the clouds, Sunless the grey waves beat.. Look down, look down, oh doomed woman, Your love lies at your feet. There's a gay girl laughing. There's a gay girl laughing For pleasure of the sky, Oh, laughing low and tenderly In love of soft-breathed sigh Of wind and greying shadows, That incorporeal lie Across sun-ardent grasses Where bird wings poise and fly. There's a woman very sorrowful As empty days go by, Uncounted hours watched hopelessly By heart too hurt to cry; There's a gay girl laughing For joy of earth and sky, And a woman dumbly sorrowful, Who am I ... Who am I .. Champagne. Yellow-pale and bubbling-bright, Effervescence of delight, Froth of laughter, foam of song, Rain of rose leaves blown along; Pretty women dressed in pink, Kisses swift as glasses' clink:â Over brim of lifted light, Yellow-pale and bubbling-bright, Life, a laugh's length old is he, Tips alluring wink at me! The Black-mailing Ruffian. But let him try, the Sinner with the Key, To block my way; I'll make him let me through! A tip-toe stand, (ha! ha! now do you see?) Flap crooked-up arms .. Cry Cock-a-doodle-doo! Bob White. Bob White! Bob White! On brink of night, On edge of day, While dawn is grey In eastern sky, I hear your cry Bob White! Bob White! And what do you say Bob White? Bob White? That the sun is up, That it's light, light, light! That it's time to be out, Out, out and away, The day is here, The glorious day! That's what you say Bob White! Bob White! In sweet of day While dawn grows bright. An Early Christian Hymn âHow doth the Heathen rageâ How doth the ramping Roman rage These peaceful vales among; How wide the swathe his comment cuts, How fatal is his tongue. We may not smoke, we may not drink, Our work he holds in scorn; Of joy bereft, of use despoiled, He leaves us all forlorn. A cultured bunch, we hang our heads While he our faults reveals; And yet, O Lord, we often write Our Lectures for ourselves. Protect, O Lord, thy simple sheep, These peaceful vales among; Protect them from the Roman ramp, The raging Roman tongue! Non Solo. The stars are up there in the sky, I cannot tell the reason why, Nor call a single one by nameâ And yet I love them just the same. The grass is cool and green and sweet, I like its feel beneath my feet; But why it's green and how it grows I don't think anybody knows. That human beings all should be Is not a thing that troubles me, I let the simple facts suffice, We areâand most of us are nice. The way a person's mind can change From day to day is very strange, Yet, though I only see it's true, I like varietyâdon't you? Oh, many things I do not know; It's rather nice to have it so. The Universe is heaps of fun If I can't say how it is run. To Anacreon. On his Age. What thoughtless, silly nymph was she, The Lesbian, whose divinity Of darling charm set worshiping The heart to love's enrapturing Sweet service ever dedicate; But briefest moment would she wait For the immortal golden ode To hers and love's dear beauties vow'd, Then, careless-mocking, took her flight Because for-sooth the snow of white Advancing age lay on the brow Of him who sang. Ah, let her go, Belov'd Anacreon, nor grieve To think that therefore he will leave, Venus' wing'd and laughing boy, His votary bereft of Joy. Beguiling girls there many be, As fair, and wiser far, than she. They welcome time whose coming brings The art that deep enlighten'd sings More perfectly their blandishments. The fine-discerning eye resents Not signs of wisdom throned secure, For youth was never connoisseur And added years do but improve The heart that's warmed by wine and love. Bewail not then the coronal Of snowy age and venerable That binds your brow with shining band. For him whose song-inspired hand Strikes tunefully the eternal lyre Of vibrant flaming-stringed desire, The day of bliss is never over; He is forever ardent lover. Traces of the Rustic in Amos. Tis sad but true that Amos he Was less polite than ought to be A prophet though he is but minor; If he were bidden out to dine or Sup with colleagues then who knew What Amos would or wouldn't do! When he was urged a fork to try âA knife is good enough for I,â The rural Prophet would return, And, careless, smash the coffee-urn. Polish he lacked and eke repose, And now in Paradise he goes. Are his rough ways still with him there? For all his colleagues what a care! How, burdened with a social sinner, Must they lament his lack of manner! How, blushing, bitterly regret His rudimentary etiquette! Saying, What will the Seraphim And all the angels think of him! Crying, Alas how grieve, how shame us These rustic traces in our Amos! Truthful Love. Oh smiling-eyes and darling-heart; I'm sitting at your feet; Who ever thought to find on earth One so beguiling-sweet? I long to kiss your pretty hands, My heart cries out aglow, I love you, love you, smiling-eyesâ And goodness knows, it's so. Oh darling-heart and smiling-eyes You're so bewitching-dear, I'd like to spend enchanted days Just sitting by you here; My voice implore, ah, may I stay And never, never go? You are so sweet, dear darling-heart, I'm sure you will say no. The Golden Princess. Under the lemon trees and orange trees, Where the birds sing and airy fountains play, She laughs to feel the laughing breeze, She laughs to feel the shining of the day. The fair corn's silken colour is her hair, A broidered aureate shimmering is her gown, Amber and topaz are her chosen wear, Crowned is she with her royalty's bright crown; Sing, birds, for her whose heart sings radiantly Fountains and breezes laugh as laughs her heart, Day's glories, lighten on her lovingly, Who glorious-loving takes love's glorious part. Oh, gallant princess, soul and self sun's hue, As heaven tender are thine eyes of blue. The changed request O que m'importe que tu sois sage Sois belle et sois triste âBe sad, be beautiful, my love,â He prayed, oh ardent lad; âBe never a lesser thing, sweet love; Than beautiful and sad.â But now what while the coffee steams, And he grows wise the while, His ardour praysââThe coffee steams, Good Lord, my dearâplease smile!â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">UNDERGRADUATE POEMS Loneliness. The earth's all wrapped in gray shroud-mist, Dull gray are sea and sky, And where the water laps the land On gray sand-dunes stand I. Oh, if God there be, his face from me The rolling gray mists hide; And if God there be, his voice from me Is kept by the moan of the tide. Time Flies. Yesterday in the garden-close Budded and blossomed and blew a rose, Faded and fallen its petals gay; The rose lies dead in the garden to-day. But, sweet, I pray you do not sorrow, As fair a rose will bloom to-morrow. Yesterday, dearest, you and I, Swore that our love would never die. Our vows were frail as all vows be. To-day love's fled from you and me. But, sweet, I pray you do not sorrow, New love will come to us to-morrow. Thus the hours swiftly by us go; Well, I e'en wist it must be so. Do not weep now for what is past, Love and roses will never last. Then gaily speed past what is over, And gladly greet new rose and lover. The Heart of a Maid. âPetals of the marguerite, Tell me, pray, Doth he love me?âAnswer âYeaâ or ânay.ââ âLoveth?â laughs she gaily, âLet him sigh! For all the love he offers, What care I?â âPetals of the marguerite, Tell me, pray, Doth he love me?âAnswer âYeaâ or ânay.ââ âLoves not?â weeps she sorely, âLet me die! For life without his love, What care I?â Repentance. (From the old French.) In very truth, I've been a sinner And spent my life in foolish manner; Too much I've used my youthful days In lightsome, vain and sinful ways. Aye, oft I've visited the court, Made love to ladiesâidle sport! To them I've written triolets, Rondeaux, sonnets and chansonettes. With naughty lords I've often dined, Gamed, fought and all too often wined. Aye, much I've walked in paths of evil; My boon companion's been the devil. But now, alack! gay youth is spent; I'm getting oldâI'd best repent! Hail Mary! In loveliness and purity, In faith and grace and piety, In love and in humility, God give me grace to be like thee, That in my poor and low degree I, like thyself, may blessed be. Hail, Mary!</field>
