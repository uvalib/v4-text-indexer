      <field name="fulltext">[O heaven born muse! inspire my humble lay] O heaven born muse! inspire my humble lay, To sing the glories of all charming May! To wake in all an ardent wish to see The beauties, which have pleased, delighted me. Would you with more elastic step than ere you trod, Spring o'er the field and touch the grassy sod; Would you ere feel your blood with swifter course, Flow through your veins in all its youthful force; Would you ere breathe as pure an air as blew, O'er Eden's garden wet with early dew; Would you ere feel what never you enjoyed, By other scenes by other pleasures cloyed; Would you ere feel, what's far above the rest, Pleasures which sooth and satisfy the breast; Rise from your couch before the rising sun, Has o'er the plain or lofty hill begun âTo shed his orient beams on herb, fruit, flower, Glittering with dew,â or yet obtained the power To scatter from before him, far away, The freshness, beauty of the blushing day. See now the rising sun from ocean's bed, Has o'er the earth his golden glories shed; Hear now the birds, as on extended wing They clear the air, with notes melodious sing, And raise to him, to him who gave them birth, Gave them besides this green, this lovely earth, Their morning hymn. And will not these inspire In man emotions purer far, and higher, Than ere before he felt, or even thought, Could with such ease be had, such pleasure sought? Poem No. 375; 9 May 1833 [The earth is parched with heat, flowers droop and die] The earth is parched with heat, flowers droop and die, The clouds of dust fly whirling through the sky; The cattle lowing seek the friendly shade, By lofty rock or some dark forest made. The traveller spent with toil, by heat oppressed, Near some tall oak, exhausted, sinks to rest; And dreams of home, of all his soul holds dear, Dreams not, alas! of fatal danger near. Dark low'ring clouds o'er heaven's bright azure run, A bloody redness vails the scorching sun. The river's surface, late so green and bright, Rolls back its waves, dark as the shades of night. Hushed is the wind, nor e'en a zephyr blows, All nature sunk in deep profound repose. The farmer leaves his fields, with terror flies, And often turning views the angry skies. See now the waves rise higher than before, In wild commotion lash the sounding shore. See through the air the leaves and stubble borne, The slender tree from the thick grove uptorn. Hark through the heavens, with peal of awful sound, Rolls the deep thunder startling all around. The lofty hill e'en from its centre shakes, The bravest heart o'ercome with terror quakes; See on the ground, by that resistless stroke, The wretched traveller, the blasted oak, In equal lot, by equal force o'erthrown: He sunk in death, he uttered not a groan; He saw no flash, he heard no awful peal, From life to death insensibly to steal Him God decreed; why then ought man to mourn, From earthly joys to heavenly he was borne. The thunder ceased, the gloomy clouds had fled, Wide o'er the earth, refreshing zephyrs shed The sweet perfume of many a laughing flower, Or sighed with soothing notes through many a silvan bower. Poem No. 492; 24 July 1833 Lines, Written on Reading Stuart's Account of The Treatment of Slaves in Charleston Oh slavery! thou bane of human kind; Thou tyrant o'er the body and the mind; To all that's just, to all that's right a foe, Thou fill'st the world with misery and woe. Ah! many a wretch by thee is caused to mourn; From friend, from relative, from country torn, From all the joys that e'er his soul held dear, Beneath thy cruel scourge is doomed to fear. By curs't desire of gain, by thirst for gold, The unhappy victim of thy crime is sold. Is sold? to whom? would I could hide the shame! To man; O traffic base, disgraceful to the name; To man, with reason and with freedom blest, O'er all creation placed the first, and best; Alas! how fallen from that station he, Who, blest with reason, proud in being free, Can from his proper sphere a being draw, Deprive of rights, of liberty, and law; Deprive, (what's far more cruel than the rest,) Of all the gifts with which himself is blest. Would that my lips the tale could never tell, The tale of horror, known, alas! too well. Would that the world had never seen the day, When man his fellow man should thus betray, Would rather every ship that sailed the main, For such base traffic, such degrading gain, Had sunk with all beneath the raging sea, Where they from slavery ever would be free: Free from a tyrant's power, who often rends Parent from children, friend from dearest friend; Free from a life of wretchedness and woe, Free from all toil and suffering here below. Ah! who could read the story of that woe? And who if reading half their sorrow know? Would that by me their wrongs could half be told, Would that their sufferings I could half unfold. Before our God and theirs those sufferings rise, He sees their wrongs, he hears their helpless cries: Soon may those wrongs and sufferings have an end, Man be not foe to man, but friend. Poem No. 387; 13 August 1833 Lines on Mount Auburn Sing, heav'nly Muse, of that fair mountain sing, Where rest in peace the honoured dead; and where As the seasons roll around their heads, their Children oft shall come, and o'er them drop the Tear of grateful memory; and from their Example learn the better how to live, The better how to die. Learn from them, As if the glorious sun his rays still shed Upon them, and life's swift current still through Their veins ran warm: as if before them were Those forms so well remember'd, and they stood Attentive to receive a parent's will Respected. Hallowed spot! where still the dead Seem yet to live, yet to give instruction The more regarded, since from them it comes. Here, as with devious steps we wander through Thy thickets dark, or near some tomb o'er which The flowers of spring in beauty wave musing, We shall from worldly thoughts, and worldly cares Withdraw ourselves, and deep communion hold With those long since departed; and raise our Souls to him whose never ceasing goodness Crowns our life. Here oft let youth retire from Life's gay scene, from pleasures glittering round, to Learn that though they live by worldly pleasures Compassed round, and though the flowers of spring are Breathing there in richest fragrance, and the Woods are in their greenest verdure crowned, that As those flowers by winter's cruel blast their Fragrance and their beauty soon will lose, so They on earth shall flourish but awhile; that Soon their flowering spring by the chill blast Of age shall wither; and thus may they be Led, to place their happiness on things not Fleeting but eternal in the heavens. Here too let manhood come from restless cares Of life withdrawn, and learning here, from those Whose life was most employed in duties to Their country, and to man most useful, death Spares not even manhood, life's most active Scene, he shall from this lesson learn to live A better and thus a happier man. And here may age, whose silver locks proclaim Life's winter, learn that their example still Shall live and generations yet unborn Revere their memory. And let them learn âThe storms of Wintry Time will quickly pass, And one unbounded Spring encircle all;â âWhere they shall flourish in immortal youth, Unhurt, amid the war of elements, The wreck of matter and the crush of worlds.â Poem No. 423; 20 December 1833 Lines suggested by hearing the beach, at F. Peabody's Mills, South Salem. December 21. 1833. The silent moon is rising, And sheds its light around The river silent flowing, In its deep bed below. The bustle too is dying, Around the noisy mill; The workmen home are hying, And every sound is still Still save the beach's roaring, Through the shining silent night; Like chariots onward pouring To mingle in the fight. Poem No. 562; 21 December 1833 [Hast thou ever heard the voice of nature] Hast thou ever heard the voice of nature, In the whirlwind's roar, the zephyr's gentle Breath, in the fierce eagle's cry, when darting Forth he seeks the spoiler of his nest, In the soft whispering voice of love with Which the dove salutes his mate? or hast thou Seen nature put forth her force in various Forms, the lightning rend the solid oak, The lofty cedars bend like reeds before The blast, the madden'd ocean lash the shore With foam, or hast thou seen the rising sun, When first he looks forth on a summer's day, Or, when his beams fall fiercer down, the cattle Seek the cool refreshing shade, slaking their Thirst in some hoarse-murmuring brook? Hast thou e'er seen such sights or heard such sounds, And never thought of Him, who rides upon The whirlwind, who in the gentle zephyr breathes, Who to the dove, the eagle gave their notes Of rage or love, who from his awful hand The lightning hurls, the lofty cedars bend, And with his nostrils heapeth up the waves, Who made the brook to run to quench the thirst The cattle feel in summer's sultry reign? If on thine ear or sight all these have fell Unheeded, and thou hast liv'd unmindful Of a God, who gave thee sight to see and Ear to hear, and for these thy senses formed, Harmonious sounds, and ever varying Beauties; learn oft as upon thy sight or Ear they fall to think of him who made them. Poem No. 158; 7 April 1834 âAmbitione inani pectus caretâ Knowest thou what ambition gains, As reward of all its pain? Know'st thou what the precious spoils It receives for all its toils? See, with what an eager eye, Yon child pursues the butterfly; Mark his looks of joy and pleasure, As he strives to seize the treasure. Now on yonder rose it stands, Running with extended hands He would grasp the brilliant toy; Flying from the eager boy Now within a tulip's cup, 'Tis from sight almost shut up; Fill'd with joy yet mix'd with fear, Cautiously he's drawing near. See the prize is now obtain'd, The long-eluding object's gain'd; He opes his little hands with joy, Why that tear? say why? my boy. Ah! its golden splendor's fled, What thou sought'st, alas! is dead; Thy rude grasp has crush'd the fair. See ambition's prize is there. Poem No. 311; 2 June 1834 [What more delightful than to wander forth] What more delightful than to wander forth In spring, before the sun has chas'd away The freshness of the morn; or shook the dew From off the tender grass? Nature seems As young, as when the morning light first broke On Eden; as calm the river's surface; And the birds as sweetly tune their morning Hymn. Beneath the shade of oak reflected In the sleeping stream, I set me down, And muse and gaze on the unrival'd scene. Would that my thoughts could speak, my tongue describe The pleasures, that a scene like this affords! Noâlanguage is too feeble to give them Utterance. Would to him whose feelings have Been swallow'd up by love of gold; to him Whom mad ambition drives; to him whose sense Is cloy'd by luxury's empoison'd cup, Would that to them the happiness I feel I could describe! 'twould strike the fetters from The slave of gold; 'twould stop ambition's mad Career, and dash the bowl from palsied hand Of luxury. The birds their joy express In notes of sweetest harmony; without A wave the peaceful river glides along; The blue sky without a cloud rejoices; Words fail to give my feelings utterance. The pleasure within my breast surpasses Far, that which prompts the sweetest lay Of bird; more calm my breast than the smooth stream, With looks more joyful than the azure vault, In silent gratitude, I raise mine eyes To heaven. Poem No. 778; 8 June 1834 A Song Composed by Mr J. Very, to be Sung at the Class-Supper of the Sophomore Class of 1834 Shall college suppers be forgot, And never brought to min'? The friends we've had remembered not, And days o' auld lang syne? Those suppers full o' mirth and glee, Those friends so true and kin'; No better we shall ever see, Than those o' auld lang syne. And if those friends we ever meet, In any foreign clime; We'll take them by the hand and greet, And speak o' auld lang syne. If false and hollow all beside, Shall prove to me and mine; Then sweetly o'er my mind shall glide, The thoughts o' auld lang syne. As long as Ceres gives the grain, And Bacchus yields the wine; So long shall in my breast remain, The thoughts o' auld lang syne. Then fill your cups my hearty friends, We'll have a cheerfull time; We'll use the gifts that Bacchus sends, And drink t' auld lang syne. Chorus. For auld lang syne my dear For auld lang syne We'll tak' a cup of kindness yet, For auld lang syne. Poem No. 418; spring 1834 Death of Lafayette He is gone, loaded with years and honors! He who before the rich rewards of Kings Preferred to succor the distressed, and raise His arm in freedom's holy cause, is gone! Mourn France a son, who shed around thy name A never-fading splendor! He caus'd no Widow's tears to flow, he caus'd no orphans âTo demand their sire with tears of artless Innocence.â Heaven hasten'd not to snatch from Our admiring gaze; but granted riches And honors, length of days to show, that, e'en Upon earth, virtue is oft rewarded. Columbia's daughters weep! But for him Your children, now perhaps in bondage, Might live to curse the day that gave them birth. And yet her sons lament! lament for him, Who in his youthful days your fathers' arm Upheld, reviv'd their drooping hopes, and gave Them vigor to resist their haughty foe. Ye mountains veil your heads in clouds and mourn For him, who around your summits cast glory More bright than noon-day sun! Ye waving pines Sigh louder in the blast; for he, who gave You liberty's fair soil, is now no more. And thou, O boundless ocean, mourn! for ne'er Again thy waves shall bear to freedom's coast, One more worthy of thy lamentation. Fairer, Lafayette, than summer's day thy Latter years, and thou on whom a nation's Blessings fell, shall now receive a nation's tears. Poem No. 161; 21 June 1834 Old Age Say not, that in old age, No joys, no pleasures dwell; That it is but a page, Which only sorrows tell. Say not, in age we find Nought but a wintry shore; Round which the northern wind, And raging ocean roar. Say not, that like the tree Scorch'd by the light'ning's wing; That thus old age will be, A sear'd and barren thing. Say not, 'tis like the sun Sinking in western skies; When storm-clouds have begun To shut him from our eyes. O no, 'tis like the shore Beneath Italian skies; T'wards which with moon-lit oar The joyful boatman plies. O no, 'tis like the tree, When golden autumn's near; But with maturity, It hails its latest year. It sinks, as sinks the sun From our admiring eyes; Whose daily course is run, Fair as we saw him rise. Poem No. 410; 30 June 1834 Lines Suggested By Seeing A Butterfly Sculptured Upon A Tomb Fit emblem of th' immortal soul! though thou Art soaring high, thou didst inhabit once A dark and loathsome mansion. Such is man, Like to the worm, which once thou wast, he creeps Encumber'd now by earthly bonds, which check His eager flight, and to a narrower Sphere confine his untried powers; lest perhaps The soul ascending premature might fall Supported by too feeble wing. Attend O man! and learn thy destiny, which hand Divine has traced on nature's works. Seasons In their ceaseless round proclaim it; darkness And light; and ocean's ebb and flow in turn Succeeding; sun and moon oft veil'd in dim Eclipse; calm succeeding tempest; nature Through all her works proclaims it, from the orbs, That wheel their courses through the void immense, To insect fluttering in the summer's breeze, All, all proclaim the destiny of man. Learn then O man! from such unnumber'd signs, Where lies thy happiness, whence thy being Sprang and whither tends: if with an upward Flight thou hop'st to soar, when from this earthly Coil thou'rt freed; plume thy wings while here below; Cast off what then may clog thy flight, and bear Thee down. Passions fierce attack, attack most Direful; lust, poisoning the relish Of the soul for all that's pure; indolence, With slow yet ceaseless course eating its way, Like rust, into the mind, and deadening all Its energies: these and thousand nameless foes, That strive to fix thy thoughts on things below Thy noble destiny, repel; then, like The phoenix, thou shalt rise triumphant from Thine ashes; and, on untiring pinions, Heaven-ward borne shalt seek thy resting place. Poem No. 127; 6 July 1834 Kind Words Turn not from him, who asks of thee A portion of thy store; Though thou canst give no charity, Thou canst do what is more. The balm of comfort thou canst pour Into his grieving mind, Who oft is turn'd from wealth's proud door, With many a word unkind. Does any from the false world find, Nought but reproach and scorn; Does any, stung by words unkind, Wish that he ne'er was born; Do thou raise up his drooping heart; Restore his wounded mind; Though nought of wealth thou canst impart, Yet still thou canst be kind. Thy kindness, like the summer's shower, Shall cheer him on his way Through the false, hollow world; its power Shall reach his latest day: It stays not here, but, as the rain, Which ocean's bosom drinks, Drawn by the sun ascends again, To heaven from which it sinks; So, drawn by thee, thy words shall wing Backward their course to thee; And, in thy breast, shall prove a spring Of pure felicity. Poem No. 746; 16 July 1834 Pleasure Goddess of pleasure, where thy golden car? Rides it on zephyrs through the unclouded sky? Or mov'st thou with silken sails and silver Oars down the smooth river, sported around By daughters of the sea, fann'd by the wings Of smiling loves; or on its shady bank Do'st thou repose, lull'd by distant music Stealing soft o'er its calm bosom? or sit'st Thou in more cool retreat, some grotto dark Of living marble hewn by nature's hand, Catching the sound of mighty water-fall Borne on the wind? Though 'neath unclouded skies Thy votaries seek thee, where the zephyrs sport Around, and scatter odors from their wings; And though down the stream of life, with silken Sails wafted by prosperous winds, they glide; Thee seeking in ever-varied worldly Joys; and though from busy scenes of life Retir'd, some on the shady bank have woo'd thee; Or in grotto's dark recess, deluded; How oft hast thou, like the false flickering Light, which leads the weary trav'ller astray, Danc'd round them in thy golden car, &amp;, when They sought to enter, fled their eager grasp! Ask him, who, led astray o'er treach'rous bogs, Is wand'ring; ask of him where shines the light, Which that he follows seems:ââAt home,â he says. There, pleasure, rest thy golden car. The mind Is its own home. In fair and stormy sky Alike thou dwell'st, thy bark alike is steer'd Down the calm stream, and through the raging sea. It is the mind, communing with itself, That cast a sunshine on the paths of life; That midst adversity's dark hour can see Above a clear unclouded sky; that rides As undisturb'd upon the troubl'd waves Of active life, as in the calm haven Of retirement. Who seeks thee not within, In vain he woos thee on the shady bank; In vain he courts thee in the grotto's dark Recess. Though burst his stores with India's rich Produce, yet still he will be poor; nations May bow beneath his sway, yet weaker he Shall be than those who call him master. Let His table groan, and let his cup o'erflow; If he neglects the banquet of the mind, Drinks not from out that inward fount, which he Who drinks of never thirsts, still he shall live In want, in want shall die. Poem No. 150; 22 July 1834 [Give me an eye, that manly deeds] Give me an eye, that manly deeds Shall kindle up with living fire; That rolls enraptur'd at the strains Resounding from the heroic lyre. An eye, that does on nature's charms, With all a lover's fondness, dwell; That gazes fixt on mountain height, And wanders o'er the shady dell. An eye, that woman's tear will cloud, And woman's smile light up again; As when the rays of setting sun Succeed the cool refreshing rain. An eye, that, at misfortune's tale, Will shed the sympathetic tear; Forget its faults and kindly seek The broken, sorrowing heart to cheer. An eye, that, at friend's reproof, Shall bending, mildly own his sway, Nor kindling rashly at his words Shall madly turn in wrath away. Is there, who has an eye like this, To dwell forever next my heart; To share my joy, to share my grief, And to my breast his own impart? Poem No. 146; 9 August 1834 [I saw a child, whose eyes had never drank] I saw a child, whose eyes had never drank The cheerful light of heaven; yet they were fair And beautiful, and oft those mild blue orbs Would turn, and seem to seek the forms of those He lov'd. Full well he knew them, for we need Not sight true friends to know. If stranger's voice, Or stranger's step obtruded on his ear,â Shrieking, he to his mother closer clung, And with his fair yet sightless eyes uprais'd Would seem from her, whom best he knew, to ask Protection. His ear was tun'd to nicest Harmony. His voiceâsweet as nightingale's, That in some lone vale of Attica, 'Midst ivy dark, sits warbling her plaintive Notes. Entranc'd the shepherd, as he Hies him home with quicken'd pace, unconscious Of delay, lingers to hear her evening Song. Sightless, think not that he was sad, although The smiles of morn; the blushes of the sun, When 'neath his crimson canopy of clouds He mildly sinks to rest; the evening star, Seen from behind dark-rolling clouds smiling Amid the storm; the moon rising from out The ocean's bed; the lofty groves bending To catch the zephyrs, as they come laden With balmy spoils from many a flow'ry field; The brook leaping from rock to rock, and then Wand'ring 'mid thickets dark, where scarce the sun The noon day heat can penetrate, then through The wide-extended plain, now flowing smooth, Now ruffled, hoarsely murm'ring o'er the rocks, Until it fades in distance from our view; And though all the beauties, which with lavish Hand nature outspreads, all to him were dark; Think not, although he ne'er was bless'd By sights like these, that he was sorrowful. O no. He knew not, felt not he had want Of that he never had. With what delight O sun, would he have view'd thy morning smiles, Thy evening blushes, when thou sink'st to rest; If, into those blue eyes, that roll'd in vain To find thy light, thy piercing beam had gone! O star of eve, how beautiful wouldst thou Appear smiling amid the storm! and thou, Fair groves bending to catch the zephyrs! thou, O brook, flowing through thickets dark, and wide Extended plain! But once, ere he departed to the world, Where all are bless'd with perfect sight, the want Of vision dimm'd his eyes with tearsâbut once, For mother's fondest care prevented more. It was a summer's day cloudless and fair; Alas! that summer's day he ne'er beheld! The cooling breezes play'd around his head, Tossing in sport his auburn locks; as, on A bank cover'd with fairest flowers, mirthful He sat, near to his paternal mansion. The rose bent not beneath his airy touch; The drops of dew, that on it hung, scarce fell, And falling seem'd to mourn, that he, who on It laid so light a hand, should not behold Its beauties. Sweeter to him its fragrance, For loss of one makes other senses more Acute. Perchance a bee upon his hand Alighted. He, dreaming nought of harm, held Fast and crush'd it; but ere that was done, its Sting had deeply pierced, and many a tear Gush'd from those sightless eyes. Let us from this A moral draw: though done by him who ne'er Enjoy'd the light of day, 'twill serve to teach Those, who have always sported in its beams, A useful lesson. Oft as vice assails, Rememb'ring that it stings both soul and body, Let us cast it from us; but if within Us it has taken root and flourish'd long, Let us, like that sightless boy, though many A pang we suffer in the attempt, with firm, Unsparing grasp, crush the dire foe, and be Forever free. Poem No. 255; 15 August 1834 The New Year All hail new year! though clad in storms thou com'st, To me thou art a welcome guest. 'Tis sweet to struggle with the wintry blast, And, as the cruel storm is raging round, To feel within the breast a calm as soft &amp; sweet As summer's eve; to see the snow whirling In eddies, like the wide world in passion's Eddies mingled, to see and smile is sweet. To feel the breast as snow-flake pure, which falls Upon the cheek; or if within anger Should rise, to know 'twill melt as soon into The tide of warm and ever-flowing love. O this is sweet: come let us look where streams The cheering light, and mark rough winter's gifts, The social circle round the evening fire. See the fond mother as with looks of love She turns now here, now there, now her children Smiles upon, and now their sire; and see him As the laughing boy he raises, imprint Upon his lips a father's kiss; and from heart With bliss o'erflowing now to God a prayer Of silent gratitude he gives. What pomp Of kings can equal joy afford, or rank With all her envied state? Hadst thou a human heart, thou savage blast; 'Twould melt at such a sight, and thy rough voice Would whisper soft in gentle zephyrs round That dwelling. Poem No. 31; C. 3 January 1835 Sleigh Ride Hurra, hurra, away they go Far over the hills and fields of snow; Away they go with mirth and glee, like the prison'd bird that's just let free. Away, away, away they fly Swiftly beneath the bright spangled sky; The mirthful laugh chimes in full well With the merry gingle of many a bell. And many an eye is laughing there, That would with those isles of light compare; That glance from under the brow of night, And kindle the heart with soft delight. And there full many a cheek now glows, That rivals the hues of the fairest rose; Which spring in its warmest vale could show, But these are blushing on hills of snow. Oh! say not that winter is mirthless, then, Though the snow lays deep on mountain &amp; glen; Yet with laughing eyes and hearts of glee Away we'll fly like a bird let free. Poem No. 206; 5 January 1835 The Snow Drop Hail early harbinger of Spring! Thy sight can glad remembrance bring Of years fled by on swiftest wing, Sweet snow-white flower; I'll spend, thy humble praise to sing, An idle hour. Thou boast'st not beauty like the rose, That ne'er the blasts of winter knows, And lily-hand-protected glows In ladies' bower; Thou hid'st thy head amid the snows, My bonny flower. Yet will I seek the wild retreat, Where early stray'd my youthful feet, And with new joy thy presence greet, Sweet snow-white flower; Though youth has fled again we meet, I feel thy power. Thou hast not stay'd till warm suns smil'd, And Spring's soft voice with whispers mild First call'd thee forth; but cradl'd mid the tempest wild Thou sprang to birth; The image, thou, of many a child Of modest worth. Thus in misfortune's rudest storm Will happiness uprear its form, E'en on the brink of misery born, And beauteous grow; And smile with rosy tints of morn O'er night of woe. Poem No. 154; 8 April 1835 [Cold cold thy lips my gentle boy] Cold cold thy lips my gentle boy Thy mother presses now And closed those eyes that beamed with joy And marble white thy brow I will not mournâthough sad the lot Life brought to one so young The grief my child is all forgot It from thy bosom rung. The light of joy that lit thine eye Would not be fittened there It sought above a brighter sky An earth than this more fair. Thy lips where dwelt that sweetest smile Could not their guest detain It came to linger there awhile It could not long remain. Thy voiceâstill still its accents sweet Are whispering round my heart And call me to that blissful seat Where souls shall never part. Poem No. 87a; spring 1835? Spring Look! Winter now in trembling haste Has snatched his robe from off the hills And left to run their noisy race The loud-voiced streams &amp; twinkling rills And hied him to his sunless cave Round which the tempest's tongues unceasing rave. Now to the music of the rills The Zephyrs circle round the hills And where the robe of Winter lay The flowers peep forth to see their play And turn their eyes of various hue To catch again heaven's look of mildest blue. The trees whose stiffened boughs of late Rattled in Winter's icy blast Yon free their arms with joy elate To feel their iron bondage past And stoop towards the river's breast To view their limbs from Spring's green wardrobe drest. Poem No. 320a; spring 1835? [The morn may lend its golden smile] The morn may lend its golden smile When age has dimmed the eye It cannot then of care beguile Or check the struggling sigh Though sweet upon the dulled ear Life's notes of joy shall fall They cannot then the spirit cheer Within her silent hall. Yet here shall Friendship's morning beam With gladder radiance play The image of Life's brightest dream That ever passed away. Poem No. 528a; spring 1835? Lines To ? On the Death of His Friend âThen shall the dust return to the earth as it was, And the spirit shall return unto God who gave it.â She sleeps not where the gladsome Earth Its dark green growth of verdure waves; And where the wind's low whispering mirth Steals o'er the silent graves. She sleeps not where the wild rose lends Its fragrance to the morning air; And where thy form at evening bends To raise the voice of prayer. She sleeps not where the wandering wing Of weary bird will oft repose; And bid Death's lonely dwelling ring With joy, at day's still close. She sleeps not thereâthe wild flower's blush Would kindle up her closed eye; She could not hear sweet music's gush Pass all unheeded by. Vain, vain would Earth call forth again Her children from their narrow bed; The soul that drank her joyous strain Has fled, forever fled! The spirit's robe she gave is there, Where leans the wild flower's cheek of bloom, Where rises oft thy voice of prayer, The spirit has no tomb! Poem No. 419; 10 June 1835 North River How quiet sleep the silent waves! As gentle as an infant's breath, The gales across their slumbers sweep, Nor wake that sleep as calm as death. But see, beneath that glassy breast The mingling scenes of life arise; There spring the leafy groves to meet The blue expanse of upper skies: And hills uplift them mid the scene, And herds beneath the bright wave feed Upon the meadow's mirror'd green, Or seek repose within the shade. But look again,âthat life has fled, The breeze has swept too roughly o'er; The crested wave now rears his head, And frowns indignant on the shore. So rise within the soul's calm deep The imag'd smiles of nature's love; And claim at times their native seat, And speak of heaven's mild peace above. (Oh! who has known such sacred hours, And has not felt though all beside,â Proud wealth's high domes, the pride of power, All fortune gives,âhad been denied; Yet still beside some stream like this His life would flow as gently on, And his would be far purer bliss Than sceptr'd monarch on his throne.) But if upon the soul's calm face Dash the rough blasts of passion wild, Oh! then how soon is fled each trace Of all that in that vision smil'd. Poem No. 199; 20 July 1835 Eheu! fugaces, Posthume, Posthume, Labuntur anni. Fleeting years are ever bearing In their silent course away, All that in our pleasures sharing, Lent to life a cheering ray. Beauty's cheek but blooms to wither, Smiling hours but come to fly; They are gone! Time's but the giver, Of whate'er is doomed to die. Thou mayst touch with blighting finger, All that sense can here enjoy; Yet within my soul shall linger, That which thou canst not destroy. Love's sweet voice shall there awaken, Joys that earth cannot impart; Joys that live, when thou hast taken All that here may charm the heart. As the years are gliding by me, Fancy's pleasing visions rise; Beauty's cheek, Ah! still I see thee, Still your glances, soft blue eyes. Poem No. 128; C. 1 August 1835 The Humming-Bird I cannot heal that green gold breast, Where deep those cruel teeth have prest, Nor bid thee rear that ruffled crest, And seek thy mate, Who sits alone within his nest, Nor sees thy fate. No more with him, in summer hours, Thou'lt hum amid the leafy bowers, Nor sip at morn the dewy flowers To feed thy young, Nor seek, when evening darkly lowers, Thy nest high-hung. No more thou'lt know a mother's care, The honied spoils at eve to share, Nor teach thy tender brood to dare With upward spring Their path through sunny fields of air, On new-fledged wing. For thy return in vain shall wait Thy tender young, thy fond, fond mate, Till night's last stars beam forth full late On their sad eyes; Unseen alas! thy cruel fate! Unheard thy cries! Poem No. 220; 1 August 1835 Nature I love to sit on the green hill's side, That looks around on a prospect wide; And send my mind far away to rove O'er flowery meadow and bending grove, That looks in the silent depths below At the stranger woods that downward grow; And fly o'er the face of winding stream With beach-bird, that starts with sudden scream; Or skim with the gull the still, calm sea, Where the white sail sleeps so peacefully; Till I all forget in that waking dream, But the sky, grove, sea, and winding stream. And I hie me to the wood's green breast, On the bird's light wing that seeks her nest, With swifter flight than she sprang away To meet the bright steps of new-born day; Hark! from the spot to mother so dear, Break sweet the cries of young on mine ear. See! on the sable pine grove a-far Rains silver light from Dian's bright car; And stars steal downward with lovely ray, As if from earth to call me away, To groves, fields, where flowers of deathless bloom, Breathe o'er a land unsull'd by a tomb. Oh! grant me an hour, an hour like this, To drink from far purer streams of bliss, Than flow near the dusty paths of life, Uptost by madd'ning passion and strife; For my mind comes back with lighter spring, Than the bird from her weary wand'ring; With calm more deep than the still bright sea, Where the white sail sleeps so peacefully; To join in the world of care again, And look on the struggles and strife of men, With an eye that beams with as pure a ray, As call'd my soul from these scenes away. Poem No. 247; 15 August 1835 Religion Gather around thee treasures bright, Bid the purple nectar flow; Will these shine with heavenly light On thy rayless night of woe? Snatch the brightest wreath of fame, Man has won from fellow worm; It may prove a wreath of flame Round thy brows for aye to burn. Grasp the monarch's rod of power; Seize the warrior's iron spear; Bid death stay thy coming hour, Think ye he those arms will fear? What are theseâthe laurel crown, Or the victor's bloody sword, Or the monarch's darkest frown, Or the miser's glittering hoard,â What are these to that dread might, Which both king and slave obey, Which can hurl to realms of night Yon bright flaming orb of day? What are these to soul's calm rest?â Diamond's price is paid in vain. Monarch's might has not possess'd, Victor's arm can never gain. Poem No. 143; 24 August 1835 A Withered Leafâseen on a Poet's Table Poet's hand has placed thee there, Autumn's brown and wither'd scroll! Though to outward Eye not fair, Thou hast beauty for the soul. Though no human pen has trac'd On that leaf its learned lore; Love divine the page has grac'd, And can man's vain words teach more? Not alone dim Autumn's blast Echoes from yon tablet sear; Distant music of the Past Steals upon the poet's ear. Voices sweet of Summer hours, Spring's soft whispers murmur by, Feather'd song from leafy bowers, Draw his listening soul on high. Far above these realms he soars, Realms of Death and pale Decay; And above God's throne adores, Mid the spirit's native day. Poem No. 399; 14 November 1835 The Stars Night's wanderers! why hang ye there With angel look so bright; As if ye stooped, bright sons of air! From some far distant height? Ye gaze upon the sleeping earth, Like mother o'er her child; And ye too saw its infant birth, And looked on it, and smiled. And come ye now, when day grows dim, To bend the listening ear; And meet the heaven-ascending hymn From hearts to you so dear? Why hear I not that seraph voice, That woke with earth's first morn; And do ye not, bright ones, rejoice As when ye saw it born? Ah! voiceless now each golden lyre Has slumbered many a year; And each new day ye see expire Is numbered by a tear. Yet still ye turn the tearful eye Upon earth's wayward course; For love divine can never die, Too deep, too pure its source! And years shall comeâwhen once again Your golden lyres shall swell That sweet, that long forgotten strain, For aye on them to dwell. Poem No. 353; 22 December 1835 The Snow Bird And hast thou come to gaze on me, White wand'rer of the air! Or dost thou my warm shelter see, And ask with me to share? Thy merry chirp, and rolling eye Would seem to laugh at fear; Thou hast but come my lot to spy, And see if joy were here. But thou wast born far, far away, Bright bird of snow and storm! And with rude Winter learned to play, And love his savage form. And when he comes, and o'er the land Has flung his fleecy shroud; And on the streams has laid his hand, And hush'd their voices loud; And, driven from each hidden nest, Thy comrades of the air; And banished from the wood's green breast The music lurking there,â Thou hoverest round his snowy feet, And, with his angry howl, Thy voice of love is heard so sweet, We half forget his scowl. I bless thee bird for He, who lent Thee love for one so rude, Has bid thee seek my tenement To wake my gratitude; Thou'rt fledâand gone, perhaps, to find Thy playmates of the blast; I bless theeâfor thou'st left behind Thine image ere thou'st past. Poem No. 47; 25 December 1835 Memory Soon the silver chord is broken, Where sweet music lov'd to dwell; Soon, too soon alas! is spoken Love's fond-echo'd word, farewell. Soon the waves, so lightly bounding, All forget the tempest blast; Soon the pines, so sadly sounding, Cease to mourn the storm that's past. Soon is hush'd the voice of gladness, Heard within the green wood's breast; Yet comes back no notes of sadness, No remembrance breaks its rest. Soon the river, brightly gleaming, Rolls its dark forgetful wave; As if sun were on it beaming, And still give the light it gave. But the heart too fond may treasure Words it cannot hear againâ Echoes of remember'd pleasure, Torturing there for aye remain. Ling'ring looks around it hover, Mock with thoughts of former joy; Visions it can ne'er recover, Looks that time can ne'er destroy. Poem No. 429; late 1835âearly 1836? Memory Soon the waves, so lightly bounding, All forget the tempest blast; Soon the pines so sadly sounding, Cease to mourn the storm that's past. Soon is hushed the voice of gladness, Heard within the green wood's breast; Yet come back no notes of sadness, No remembrance breaks its rest. Soon the river, brightly gleaming, Rolls its dark forgetful wave; As if sun were on it beaming, Giving still the light it gave. But the heart,âhow fond 'twill treasure Every note of grief and joy! Oft come back the notes of pleasure, Grief's sad echoes oft annoy. There still dwell the looks that vanish, Swift as brightness of a dream; Time in vain earth's smiles may banish, There undying still they beam. Poem No. 430; 4 January 1836 King Philip âUpon the next day, Church, discovering an Indian seated on a fallen tree, made to answer the purpose of a bridge over the river, raised his musket and deliberately aimed at him. âIt is one of our own party,â whispered a savage, who crept behind him. Church lowered his gun, and the stranger turned his head. It was Philip himself, musing, perhaps, upon the fate that awaited him.ââ Thatcher's Lives of the Indians Philip, has the white man's charm Chilled with fear thy kingly breast? Has his spell unnerved thy arm, Made thee woman like the rest? Say, is this the arm, whose shock, Straight as blazing bolt from heaven, Sent thy flashing tomahawk,â And the white man's skull was riven? Is this the hand, whence arrow flew Winged with eagle's lightning speed? Did this urge thy light canoe, Quivering like yon wind-struck reed? Yesâthis is still the arm, the hand,â And there my father's dwelling place; But like thee, lonely Hope, I stand Alone amid a stranger race! My warriors brave, that gathered round Thy council fires, thou mountain fair! I hear their distant voices sound, They call me from the cloudy air. My wife, my son,âyour voices rise In murmurs soft as summer's stream; And on my darkened soul those eyes, Like stars above, in beauty gleam. But where art thou, my tender wife? 'Tis but your image mocks me now. Oh! could I snatch thee back to life, And feel thy lips upon my brow; That touch would thrill this wasted frame With all my youth's forgotten fire; And kindle up to burning flame The hopes I saw with thee expire. This is your charm, ye hated race! No other will my spirit own; Ye urge me still in deadly chase, Betrayed, abandoned, and alone. I scorn your powerâcould arm avail To drive you from my native soil; I should not feel my spirit fail, This arm would still be nerved for toil. I bow not: though I feel your might,â Though round my head your thunders ring, And round my heart has gathered night, Yet know that Philip still is king. Still will I guard thee, mountain shrine, That looks upon my father's grave; And thou shalt sadly smile on mine, And bless the arm that could not save. And while strange children gather round Thy base, my father's ancient seat! And thou shalt hear strange voices sound, And on thee press the stranger's feet; Thy pine-clad summits still shall wave, And send their mournful music sweet;â Above my own, my father's grave, 'Twill rising swell our shades to greet. Poem No. 396; c. late 1835âearly 1836 The Painted Columbine Bright image of my early years! When glowed my cheek as red as thou, And life's dark throng of cares and fears Were swift-winged shadows o'er my sunny brow. Thou blushest from the painter's page, Robed in the mimic tints of art; But Nature's hand in youth's green age With fairer hues first traced thee on my heart. The morning's blush, she made it thine, The morn's sweet breath, she gave it thee, And in thy look, my Columbine! Each fond-remembered spot she bade me see. I see the hill's far-gazing head, Where gay thou noddest in the gale; I hear light-bounding footsteps tread The grassy path that winds along the vale. I hear the voice of feathered song Break from each bush and well-known tree, And, on light pinions borne along, Comes back the laugh from childhood's heart of glee. O'er the dark rock the dashing brook, With look of anger, leaps again; And, hastening to each flowery nook, Its distant voice is heard far down the glen. Fair child of art! thy charms decay, Touched by the withered hand of Time; And hushed the music of that day, When my voice mingled with the streamlet's chime; But on my heart thy cheek of bloom Shall live when Nature's smile has fled; And, rich with memory's sweet perfume, Shall o'er her grave thy tribute incense shed. There shalt thou live and wake the glee That echoed on thy native hill; And when, loved flower! I think of thee, My infant feet will seem to seek thee still. Poem No. 78; c. early 1836 The Frozen Ship In 1775 Capt. Warrens, the master of a Greenland whale ship, fell in with an English ship surrounded with icebergs. The last page of her log-book ran thus. âNov. 14, 1762. We have now been imprisoned in the ice seventeen days. The fire went out yesterday, and our master has been trying ever since to kindle it, but without success. His wife died this morning. There is no relief.â Capt. Warrens learned on his return to England, that the ship had been missing thirteen years. Why rings not back the welcome shout From yonder ice-bound ship? Why floats not her glad standard out, With bright'ning sunbeams lit? Why hear we not the hum of life, Amid that silent throng; The laugh, the joke, with joyance rife, The merry seaman's song? Ah, mailed in ice their bodies stand! Each fixed, and glassy eye Seems gazing on the wondering band, That now are gathered nigh. Each icy hand still grasps the rope, It held when life was there; When round their hearts yet lingered hope, And wrestled with despair. Speak, ye cold lips! say what ye lock Within that marble breast; Though deep our souls the tale should shock, It cannot break your rest. Say! what sharp pangs your bosom rent, When the low, flickering fire, Its last warm rays of life had lent, And left you vain desire. Where were your thoughts, when round your frame Claspt the cold, icy night; Gathered they round the hearth's warm flame, Lighting fond faces bright? When, to your last loud cries of woe, No human accents spoke; And, roaring deep, the waves below In fetters o'er you broke; Did you upraise the trembling prayer To Him, who rules the sea; And triumph o'er your soul's despair And mortal agony? Ye answer not: no voice can wake That tale within your breast; Nor human thoughts of suffering break Your calm, eternal rest. Beyond this changing, troubled sphere, Your spirit rests above; Where neither death, nor mortal fear, Again its peace can move. Poem No. 825; c. 16 April 1836 My Mother's Voice My mother's voice! I hear it now, I feel her hand upon my brow, As when, in heart-felt joy, She raised her evening hymn of praise, And called down blessings on the days Of her loved boy. My mother's voice! I hear it now, Her hand is on my burning brow, As in that early hour; When fever throbbed through all my veins, And that fond hand first soothed my pains, With healing power. My mother's voice! It sounds as when She read to me of holy men, The Patriarchs of old; And gazing downward on my face, She seemed each infant thought to trace My young eyes told. It comes, when thoughts unhallowed throng, Woven in sweet deceptive song, And whispers round my heart; As when, at eve, it rose on high; I hear, and think that she is nigh, And they depart. Though round my heart all, all beside, The voice of Friendship, Love had died; That voice would linger there; As when, soft pillowed on her breast, Its tones first lulled my infant rest, Or rose in prayer. Poem No. 343; c. spring 1836 The Arab Steed Amid his foes that slumbered round, The desert chief lay faint and bound; And joyless saw the fires of night Look silent down from their blue height; For round his heart, as he lay there, Gathered the spectres of despair. His wife, his home, his children, all The lonely heart would fain recall To cheer its darkest hour of gloom, Seemed phantoms starting from the tomb, That rise when blackening clouds of woe Their shadows o'er the spirit throw. He startsâupon him breaks a voice He ne'er had heard but to rejoice, The neighing of his sable steed, Whose lion strength and lightning speed Had been his only, surest trust, When round him rolled the battle dust. The captive cord had fettered fast That swiftness of the winged blast; But still his lion spirit now, Unchained, is struggling on his brow, As if there lived a soul of flame, No chain could hold, no arm could tame. He startsâthough 't were a sight of pain, He still would see that friend again; Again his noble steed would bless With his known voice and kind caress; Wounded and cut by torturing thong He drew his heavy limbs along, And when he saw his courser nigh, The tear was starting in his eye. âI wept not when the thirsty sand Drank the warm life-blood of my band, Nor when I heard the Turk's proud voice Loud o'er their fallen foe rejoice; But when I see thee, once so free, A sharer in my misery, The tears my pride forbade to flow Fall now unheeded o'er thy woe. âNo more, mid sabres flashing bright, Thou'lt share the rapture of the fight; Nor hover round the haughty foe, With whistling shaft and twanging bow; Nor, when dark danger's hour is near, Will thy tried strength my courage cheer, And, swift as dust-cloud in the wind, Leave far the baffled foe behind. âNo more shall Jordan's limpid tide With coolness bathe thy reeking side, Nor thy proud chest in triumph brave The dashings of its angry wave; No more, when day's bright beams are spent, Thy feet with joy shall seek the tent, Where now my children haste to bear The camel's milk, thy wonted share, And stretch their little hands in vain To bid thee take the welcome grain. âAnd must I see thee then, my brave, The desert's lord, a Pacha's slaveâ Shut from the free-trod pastures wide, The dwellings of thy native pride? Within the Turk's close-prisoned roof Shall fetters bind thy swift-winged hoof? Noâthough these limbs can ne'er be free, His hand shall throw no chain on thee.â He saidâand bit the cord that bound His sable courser's neck around; And, as his hands so fondly stroke, His voice in struggling accents broke. âGoâswift as thou wert wont to speed Along thy oft-trod path, my steed, Returnâand seek the tent, thy home, Round which thy footsteps loved to roam; And pass within its folds thy head, Where now my infants sadly tread, And tell themâthey shall hear no more The voice of love they heard before.â He ceasedâbut still his steed remained,â No cord now boundâyet love still chainedâ He could not leave the voice that blessed, The hand that had so oft caressed, But stops, and where his master's belt Was strongest girt, a moment smelt; Then seized with firm-set teeth the prize, And homeward o'er the desert flies. The night's last stars have left the sky, And day has oped his burning eye; And now the steed, with labor spent, Has gained, with morn, the well-known tent, And lifeless sinks upon the sand, Where round him throng the startled band. In vain the children strive to raise The head all silent to their praise, And call by each endearing name Their hearts' warm sympathy can frame;â No tongue can now recall the life, That perished in that noble strife, The love whose strength was all unknown, Until with life that love had flown. And loud was heard the voice of grief For him whose death restored their chief; And maidens' voice, and minstrels' song The memory of his deed prolong. Poem No. 36; c. spring 1836 Hymn, Sung At The Dedication of The New Stone Church of The North Society In Salem June 22d, 1836. The weight of years is on the pile Our fathers raised to Thee, O God; On this, our temple, rest thy smile, Till bent with days its tower shall nod. Thy word awoke, O Power Divine! The hymn of praise in nature's hall; To man Thou gavst to rear thy shrine, And on Thee as his Father call:â To pour in music's solemn strain The heart's deep tide of grateful love; And kindle in thine earthly fane A spirit for his home above. Thou bad'st him on thine altar lay The holy thought, the pure desire; That light within a brighter ray Than sunbeam's glance, or vestal fire. 'Twill burn when heaven's high altar flame On yon blue height, has ceased to glow; And o'er earth's dark dissolving frame The sun-light of the spirit throw. Father! within thy courts we bow, To ask thy blessing, seek thy grace; O smile upon thy children now! Look down on this, thy hallowed place! And when its trembling walls shall feel Time's heavy hand upon them rest; Thy nearer presence, Lord! reveal, And make thy children wholly blest. Poem No. 592; c. 22 June 1836 Song [For the Valedictory Exercises of the Senior Class of Harvard University, 1836] No more around the social board Shall rise the laugh of glee; The song that stirred our bosoms once Has hushed its melody. Chorus. Youth's cherished spot! what wreaths of joy Around thy memory twine! While throbs the heart's warm beating pulse, 'Twill tell of âauld lang syne.â The glance of love, the friendly word Shall be returned no more; Nor answer when our footsteps tread The scenes they loved before. Chorus. Youth's cherished spot! what wreaths of joy Around thy memory twine! While throbs the heart's warm beating pulse, 'Twill tell of âauld lang syne.â They who upon our pathway shed Life's gladdest beams are here, Upon the shrine where we have knelt To shed the parting tear. Chorus. We lingerâstruggling accents rise Each friendly ear to greet; In one farewell our hearts would breathe Whole years of memory sweet. Adieu! we cannot speak the thoughts Our swelling breasts would speak, For feeling's deepest, fullest tide, The tongue's vain words are weak. Chorus. We lingerâstruggling accents rise Each friendly ear to greet; In one farewell our hearts would breathe Whole years of memory sweet. Poem No. 355; c. 19 July 1836 Washington The Father of his country stood And saw awake the glittering plain; As morn on mountain height and wood Returned to look again. As in his boyhood's earliest hour, In nature's forest home untrod, The noblest form of human power Kneels childlike to his God. His sword, that through the battle cloud Flashed terror on his country's foe, Its lightening hides beneath the shroud Of verdure waving low. He, who amid the battle's shock Spoke calmness to the struggling brave, And stood like sea-encompassed rock Unshaken by its wave; Trusts not the warrior's proudest boastsâ The thunders of the tented field;â He kneels before the God of hosts, Of all that live the shield! From hence was kindled in thy breast That holiest flame of Liberty; That made thy country's cause the blest, And gave her sons like thee. From hence it caught the sacred flame, That lit with hope her deepest night; And blazes still around thy name, A halo of undying light! Poem No. 496; c. 20 August 1836 The Autumn Leaf Thou fair yet lifeless leaf! on whom decay Seems beautiful, red glowing as thou hangest Beneath the earliest touch of autumn's hand; I pluck thee fluttering from thy parent vine, Before the rude wind tears thee from its fond Embrace to toss thy form, in idle play, Shrivelled and brown upon the winter air: For thou art as a tablet to the thoughts That now are gushing fresh, as if my soul Had drank new life amid these lofty shades, And felt its being moved by sympathy With Unseen power. Brief monitor of frail humanity! Why has decay that steals from off the cheek The bloom of health, traces the aged brow With lines of care dimming the burning eye, And snatching from the form its lofty grace, Why has it wrought on thee so fair a change; And why in tints of beauty robed thy form Brighter than decked before thy vernal prime? Heaven's teachings are not lost on humble heart Though written on the leaves, and strown upon The faithless winds, still will its messages Forever reach the heart that loves its God. 'Twas well to touch thy death with gayest hues Even as the day sinks wrapt in gorgeous clouds, For thou wert born to live but on the eye, A thing of outward sense; of whose green youth, And vigorous noon, and glittering age the child, In lisping words, recounts. Thou wast not born, Like him who gazes on thy splendor now, To light a hidden soul with brighter hues Than wait upon the colored dawn and hang Upon the dying leaf; and, while decay Deals rudely with his outward life, and clouds Impatient gather to obscure its glory, To shape like him, from out a world of change A spirit into those eternal forms Of Love, and Majesty, and Beauty, which, Though here by feeble glance of sense unseen, The all holy eyes of God approve. Poem No. 673; c. 1 October 1836 The Winter Bird Thou singest alone on the bare wintery bough As if Spring with its leaves were around thee now; And its voice, that was heard in the laughing rill, And the breeze, as it whispered o'er meadow and hill, Still fell on thine ear, as it glided along To join the sweet tide of thine own gushing song Sing onâthough its sweetness was lost on the blast And the storm has not heeded thy song as it passed; Yet its music awoke in a heart that was near A thought whose remembrance will ever prove dearâ Though the brook may be frozen, though silent its voice And the gales through the meadows no longer rejoice Still I felt as my ear caught thy glad note of glee, That my heart in life's winter might carol like thee. Poem No. 695; c. 31 December 1836 The Boy's Dream A Ballad A youth looked into the running stream, And he sighed to be as free; That he might visit the city's mart, And come to the boundless sea. And on its waters swift be borne To countries distant, and strange; Which he read of in books, or heard men tell, And over the world to range. Then he sought for a ship, and left his home, And mother and father dear; And he roamed the wide world from land to land, And was gone for many a year. He sailed where the reefs of coral grow, He sailed by the ice-bergs cold, He saw the wonders of every clime, And rich was his ship with gold. But no place he found, that was so dear, As that he had left behind; And a weary life he seemed to lead, The sport of the waves and wind. He gazed around on the lonely deep, And his heart grew sick, to see How it stretched forever on, and on, And shoreless seemed to be. And his thoughts flew back to those early days; To his home by the river's side; And his father and mother he there had left, To roam the ocean wide. It seemed far better to live as they, And see but the sights they saw; Than roam as a sailor from land to land, Without a home, or law. And his mind was changed; he left his ship, And swift sought the pleasant stream; Where he left his parents to mourn his loss, And followed his boyhood's dream. Poem No. 24; 1834â36? [I murmur not though hard the lot] I murmur not though hard the lot To see another's that fond smile; And feel myself all, all forgot, And left to weep unseen the while. I murmur not that thou canst give Another joy so dear to me; Though for that smile alone I live, Am glad but while I look on thee. I would not ask those eyes to turn, And shed their light upon my woe; To cool these throbbing veins that burn With passion's hottest maddest flow. I would not cause that gentle heart A sigh of sorrow, shade of grief; To bid this mountain weight depart, And give my anguished soul relief. Still may that bright and sunny brow No shade of care or sorrow know; Still beam those eyes as bright as now, Though not on me their smile they throw. I will not mourn though sad the weight, The weary weight life brings to me; For thou shalt live with joy elate, With cheek all bloom and heart all glee. Those eyes another's love shall speak, Those lips shall breathe another's name; Yet vain in other's souls they seek A purer love, a holier flame. 'Twill burn, when yon bright beaming star With kindred light has ceased to glow, As pure in yon blue heaven afar, As in its earthly shrine below. Poem No. 248; 1836? The Torn Flower I tore theeâthou who looked so sweet, And shed thy fragrance at my feet; I tore thee in my wrath; Scattered thy sweetness to the wind, Nor left one look of love behind To smile upon my path. I mourn too late! Ah! ne'er again Shall visit thee the small-dropped rain, The gently falling dew; Nor morn, nor noon, nor eve's still hour Shall watch the spot, ill-fated flower! Where once thy beauty grew. The storms that filled the troubled sky Have lightly passed thy shelter by, Pleased with thy sweet perfume; More cruel than the angry blast I madly crushed thee as I past, And robbed thee of thy bloom. Would that the tears I o'er thee shed Might raise again thy drooping head To life and joy once more; Then would I learn me of the storm To spare thy bright and tender form, My heart's mad passion tore. Poem No. 278; 1836? [The moon was shining on the deck] The moon was shining on the deck The stars looked out upon the sea The sail had dwindled to a speck That was upon our lea. I crept beside the grey-locked man Whose words I loved to hear so well He knew my wish and thus began His ocean tale to tell. The ship from Hamburgh held her way And playing round her stately form The waves curled bright their wreaths of spray All heedless of the storm. The ship seemed glad to feel once more Around her roll the deep blue main As onward bounding from the shore She heard its voice again And I was young my boy as thou And all around seemed strange and new I watched the ocean's deep green brow I watched the heaven's so blue I looked behindâmy home had fled And seemed afar like distant cloud My mother all I loved seemed dead I wept and sobbed aloud. Poem No.527; 1836? [Home of my youth! Where first my lot was cast] Home of my youth! Where first my lot was cast To Thee I dedicate my feeble song Upon whose hills how swift the moments passed As linked with flowers the days moved gaily on Though hills more fair &amp; streams more bright than thine May lure my eye as from thy paths I stray While memory's ray shall on their summits shine What spot shall seem more fair to me than they Home of my youth would that a worthy lay Might tell my love for thee to distant time Far as thy sons o'er ocean's trackless way Have borne thy nameâto India's sunny climeâ A blessing rest alike on thee &amp; thine To those whose bark shall rove from strand to strand Where'er they are whate'er their lot may be Sweet be the name of their own father-land. Poem No. 175; 1836? [Haunts of my youth farewell! A while I leave] Haunts of my youth farewell! A while I leave You in your loveliness! A while I go To visit other scenes, more fair, perhaps, but none I love so well. Resistless as thy stream, Fair river, when thou pour'st along swol'n with Autumnal rains, is love of home within The breast of man. So Afric's wretched son With eye bent on his fast-receding home, Has drop'd his scanty fare, heeds not his chains But with the tear-drops starting in his eye ExclaimsââThere I was bornâââThere is my home.â The wanderer of ten long years, whom oft Encounter'd dangers never learn'd to shed A tear, weeps like a child when he beholds The smoke of much-lov'd Ithaca. Beauty's Fabl'd Goddess, since on earth no more she Deigns to dwell, has left with thee, O home, her All-enchanting Love. Dearer to Lapland's Sons her new-clad plains, her ice-bound rivers, Her mountain tops the residence of storms, Than the green sunny plains, the vine-clad hills The winding streams of favor'd Italy. And ye my youthful haunts, though some there are On which my eyes could dwell a summer's day Nor heed the sun blushing to leave so Fair a scene, nor evening's soft approach warning My lingering footsteps home, though some there are Which those who look on fairer scenes would pass Contemptuous by yet all to me are Beautiful, round all alike O home thy Charm is thrown I love you all. The yellow Leaves at my return perhaps will rustle In the autumnal blast or winter's snows May hide my winding path still will I trace It out: for there's no winter in my love For thee no age but death. Amid the snows Of age 'twill like the ever-green appear As fresh as in my vernal prime. Poem No. 160; 1836? Death Decay and Change Sounds are ringing on my ear Sights are floating in my eye Now those sounds I cannot hear And those visions tooâthey fly! What is this? the tolling bell Mournfully the surges roll That of the departed tell He a brother of my soul. What new note is on the air That just bore the knell of pain Reaper's voicesâhome they bear Autumn's yellow glittering grain. Where has fled from me the face That from me this moment past Ah! Why clothed thee such a grace If thou wast to flee so fast! See a bud of earliest bloom Presses now upon my sight In the distance rolls the gloom That o'er me had cast its night But though fair as thee 'twill fade Swift as all that fled before On its stem Time's hand is laid There! I see its bloom no moreâ Death Decay and Change succeeding Let us live a life of love Each their silent tokens heeding As words whispered from above To the lonely broken hearted By his kindest nearest Friend Of a love that is not parted Of a life that cannot end Poem No. 432; 1836? The Portrait Would I might stay those features as they pass, Where beauty seems as if she loved to dwell; And chain that smile upon the fickle glass, That smile whose sweetness words in vain would tell; Or fix thy glance with all its heaven of blue, The evening star that floats its azure through! But noâthe spot where I would bid them rest Is all unworthy they should linger there; The blush of morn on Ocean's slumbering breast, The star bright-imaged in its depths of air Vanish from off its bosom like thy smile, That rests but on so frail a thing awhile, Then seeks a home whence it may ne'er depart, The faithful mirror of a loving heart. Poem No. 852; c. late 1836âearly 1837 The Canary Bird I cannot hear thy voice with others' ears, Who make of thy lost liberty a gain; And in thy tale of blighted hopes and fears Feel not that every note is born with pain. Alas! that with thy music's gentle swell Past days of joy should through thy memory throng, And each to thee their words of sorrow tell, While ravished sense forgets thee in thy song. The heart that on the past and future feeds, And pours in human words its thoughts divine, Though at each birth the spirit inly bleeds, Its song may charm the listening ear like thine, And men with gilded cage and praise will try To make the bard like thee forget his native sky. Poem No. 221; c. 15 April 1837 The Tree I love thee when thy swelling buds appear, And one by one their tender leaves unfold, As if they knew that warmer suns were near Nor longer sought to hide from winter's cold; And when with darker growth thy leaves are seen To veil from view the early robin's nest, I love to lie beneath thy waving skreen With limbs by summer's heat and toil opprest; And when the autumn winds have stript thee bare, And round thee lies the smooth untrodden snow, When nought is thine that made thee once so fair, I love to watch thy shadowy form below, And through thy leafless arms to look above On stars that brighter beam when most we need their love. Poem No. 246; c. 22 April 1837 The Fossil Flower Dark fossil flower! I see thy leaves unrolled, With all their lines of beauty freshly marked, As when the eye of Morn beamed on thee first, And thou first turn'dst to meet its welcome smile. And sometimes in the coals' bright rain-bow hues, I dream I see the colors of thy prime, And for a moment robe thy form again In splendor not its own. Flower of the past! Now as I look on thee, life's echoing tread Falls noiseless on my ear; the present dies; And o'er my soul the thoughts of distant time, In silent waves, like billows from the sea, Come rolling on and on, with ceaseless flow, Innumerable. Thou mayest have sprung unsown Into thy noon of life, when first earth heard Its Maker's sovereign voice; and laughing flowers Waved o'er the meadows, hung on the mountain crags, And nodded in the breeze on every hill. Thou may'st have bloomed unseen, save by the stars That sang together o'er thy rosy birth, And came at eve to watch thy folded rest. None may have sought thee in thy fragrant home, Save light-voiced winds, that round thy dwelling played, Or seemed to sigh, oft as their wingÃ©d haste Compelled their feet to roam. Thou may'st have lived Beneath the light of later days, when man, With feet free-roving as the homeless wind, Scaled the thick-mantled height, coursed plains unshorn, Breaking the solitude of nature's haunts With voice that seemed to blend, in one sweet strain, The mingled music of the elements. And when against his infant frame they rose, Uncurb'd, unawed by his yet feeble hand, And when the muttering storm, and shouting wave, And rattling thunder, mated, round him raged, And seemed at times like demon foes to gird, Thou may'st have won with gentle look his heart, And stirred the first warm prayer of gratitude, And been his first, his simplest altar-gift. For thee, dark flower! the kindling sun can bring No more the colors that it gave, nor morn, With kindly kiss, restore thy breathing sweets: Yet may the mind's mysterious touch recall The bloom and fragrance of thy early prime: For he who to the lowly lily gave A glory richer than to proudest king, He painted not those darkly-shining leaves, With blushes like the dawn, in vain; nor gave To thee its sweetly-scented breath, to waste Upon the barren air. E'en though thou stood Alone in nature's forest-home untrod, The first-love of the stars and sighing winds, The mineral holds with faithful trust thy form, To wake in human hearts sweet thoughts of love, Now the dark past hangs round thy memory. Poem No. 95; c. early 1837 The April Snow It will not stay! the robe so pearly white, Which fell in folds on nature's bosom bare, And sparkled in the winter moonbeams' light, A vesture such as sainted spirits wear; It will not stay! Look, from the open plain, It melts beneath the glance of April's sun; Nor can the rock's cool shade the snow detain, It feeds the brooks, which down the hill-side run. Why should it linger? Many-tinted flowers And the green grass its place will quickly fill, And, with new life, from sun and kindly showers, With beauty deck the meadow and the hill; Till we regret to see the earth resume This snowy mantle for her robe of bloom. Poem No. 309; early to mid 1837? Nature Nature, my love for thee is deeper far Than strength of words though spirit-born can tell; For while I gaze they seem my soul to bar, That in thy widening streams would onward swell Bearing thy mirrored beauty on my breast; Now through thy lonely haunts unseen to glide, A motion that scarce knows itself from rest, With pictured flowers and branches on its tide; Then by the noisy city's frowning wall, Whose armed heights within its waters gleam, To rush with answering voice to ocean's call And mingle with the deep its swoln stream; Whose boundless bosom's calm alone can hold That heaven of glory in thy skies unrolled. Poem No. 348; c. 29 July 1837 An Evening Walk I love at quiet eventide, Far from the city's noise to stray; To climb the brow of rocky hill, And watch the light of parting day. To see reflected on the clouds, In red and gold its colors glow; Or watch the lengthening shadows fall On field and valley, far below. To hear the quail's low, plaintive call, At intervals, the stillness break; Or sprightly sparrow's cheerful note, That memory's pleasing fancies wake. Faint rises on the tranquil air The tardy insects' droning song; Which still, amid the closing flowers, The busy work of day prolong. O'er swamp, and meadow stretching far, The evening shadows stealthy creep; Till all the darkening landscape round Is wrapt at length in slumber deep. I seem more near to Nature's heart, And feel that I her secrets share; The noisy world forgotten is, With all its tumults, toil, and care. Another, better life I live, A life to worldly minds unknown; Which Nature to her votaries gives, Enjoyed, and prized by them alone. Poem No. 244; 25 August 1837 Beauty I gazed upon thy faceâand beating life, Once stilled its sleepless pulses in my breast, And every thought whose being was a strife Each in its silent chamber sank to rest; I was not, save it were a thought of thee, The world was but a spot where thou hadst trod, From every star thy glance seemed fixed on me, Almost I loved thee better than my God. And still I gazeâbut 'tis a holier thought Than that in which my spirit lived before, Each star a purer ray of love has caught, Earth wears a lovelier robe than then it wore, And every lamp that burns around thy shrine Is fed with fire whose fountain is Divine. Poem No. 232; 24 September 1837 The Voice of God They told meâwhen my heart was glad, And all around but said rejoiceâ They told me, and it made me sad, The thunder was God's angry voice. And then I thought that from the sky, Throned monarch o'er a guilty world, His glanceâthe lightning flashing byâ His hand the bolts of ruin hurled. But I have learned a holier creed Than that my infancy was taught; 'Twas, from the words of love I read And the sweet lips of nature, caught, Yesâ'twas my Father's voice I feared, It fills the sky, the wide-spread earth; It called in every tone that cheered Those rosy hours of childhood's mirth. 'Tis only on the heedless ear It breaks in thunder's pealing wrath Winging the wanderer's steps with fear To fly destruction's flaming path. God dwells no more afar from me, His voice in all that lives is heard; From the loud shout of rolling sea To warbled song of morning's bird. In all that stirs the human breast, That wakes to mirth or draws the tear, In passion's storm or soul's calm rest, Alike the voice of God I hear. Poem No. 650; c. 2 December 1837 The Wind-Flower Thou lookest up with meek, confiding eye Upon the clouded smile of April's face, Unharmed, though Winter stands uncertain by, Eyeing with jealous glance each opening grace. Thou trustest wisely! in thy faith arrayed, More glorious thou than Israel's wisest King; Such faith was his, whom men to death betrayed; As thine who hear'st the timid voice of Spring, While other flowers still hide them from her call, Along the river's brink, and meadow bare; Thee will I seek beside the stony wall, And in thy trust with childlike heart would share, O'erjoyed, that in thy early leaves I find A lesson taught by Him, who loved all human kind. Poem No. 684; c. 23 December 1837 The Sabbatia The sweet briar rose has not a form more fair, Nor are its hues more beauteous than thine own, Sabbatia, flower most beautiful and rare! In lonely spots blooming unseen, unknown. So spiritual thy look, thy stem so light, Thou seemest not from the dark earth to grow; But to belong to heavenly regions bright, Where night comes not, nor blasts of winter blow. To me thou art a pure, ideal flower, So delicate that mortal touch might mar; Not born, like other flowers, of sun and shower, But wandering from thy native home afar To lead our thoughts to some serener clime, Beyond the shadows and the storms of time. Poem No. 580; late 1837? The Passage Bird Far far o'er city &amp; field thou art flying While day lends its brightness to shine on thy way Thou stoopst not though green groves beneath thee are lying And wave with soft voice their welcome to stay High high over hill top &amp; mountain thou soarest O'er the wide spreading lake &amp; the still gliding stream Where Ocean thine anthem in thunders thou pourest And where on thy bosom the canvass sails gleam Still onward thou stoopest not though weary thy pinion Though fair spread the lands that thy wing spreadeth o'er For fairer the climes of the sun's bright dominion And sweeter the Ocean's loud voice on its shore Thou hearst though I hear not the rippling waves wander Beneath where thy nest hangs leaf-sheltered above Thou seest though unseen in the dark distant yonder The home of thy heart &amp; the mate of thy loveâ Poem No. 112; 1837? A Sonnet Thy beauty fades and with it too my love, For 'twas the self-same stalk that bore its flower; Soft fell the rain, and breaking from above The sun looked out upon our nuptial hour; And I had thought forever by thy side With bursting buds of hope in youth to dwell, But one by one Time strewed thy petals wide, And every hope's wan look a grief can tell: For I had thoughtless lived beneath his sway, Who like a tyrant dealeth with us all, Crowning each rose, though rooted on decay, With charms that shall the spirit's love enthral, And for a season turn the soul's pure eyes From virtue's changeless bloom that time and death defies. Poem No. 710; c. 21 April 1838 The Columbine Still, still my eye will gaze long-fixed on thee, Till I forget that I am called a man, And at thy side fast-rooted seem to be, And the breeze comes my cheek with thine to fan; Upon this craggy hill our life shall pass, A life of summer days and summer joys, Nodding our honey bells mid pliant grass In which the bee half hid his time employs; And here we'll drink with thirsty pores the rain, And turn dew-sprinkled to the rising sun, And look when in the flaming west again His orb across the heaven its path has run; Here, left in darkness on the rocky steep, My weary eyes shall close like folding flowers in sleep. Poem No. 441; c. 9 June 1838 The Robin Thou needst not flutter from thy half-built nest Whene'er thou hearst man's hurrying feet go byâ; Fearing his eye for harm may on thee rest, Or he thy young's unfinished cottage spy; All will not heed thee on that swinging bough, Nor care that round thy shelter spring the leaves, Nor watch thee on the pool's wet margin now For clay to plaster straws thy cunning weaves; All will not hear thy sweet out-pouring joy, That with morn's stillness blends the voice of song; For over-anxious cares their souls employ, That else upon thy music borne along And the light wings of heart-ascending prayer Had learned that Heaven is pleased thy simple joys to share. Poem No. 686; c. 9 June 1838 Hymn Thou who keepst us each together Who as one in heart may meet; We are called we know not whither; Thou wilt guide our wandering feet. Homes we leave, the world's warm greeting Spoken round the household fire; We have known in friendship meeting All the heart can here desire. Yet Thou givest all we borrow From these brightened scenes around, And Thou biddst us rise and follow Him who hath acceptance found. Though through thorny ways his leading, And untried the path before; We as children all things needing Here a Father's love adore. He has spoken; Him Thou hearest; He descends from heaven to save; Thou that on the billow fearest, âFaithâ! âwalk firm the rocking waveâ! âLittle flock be not ye troubled, Thine the kingdom of the Son; Though earth's weight of woe be doubled, He the crown of Light hath won.â Poem No. 701; 1836âspring 1838? The Stranger's Gift I found far culled from fragrant field and grove Each flower that makes our Spring a welcome guest, In one sweet bond of brotherhood inwove An ozier band their leafy stalks compressed; A stranger's hand had made their bloom my own, And fresh their fragrance rested on the air, His gift was mineâbut he who gave unknown, And my heart sorrowed though the flowers were fair: Now oft I grieve to meet them on the lawn, Scattered along the path I love to go, By One who on their petals paints the dawn, And gilt with sunset splendors bids them glow, For I ne'er asked âwho steeps them in perfume?â Nor anxious sought His love who crowns them all with bloom! Poem No. 228; c. 18 August 1838 The New Birth 'Tis a new lifeâthoughts move not as they did With slow uncertain steps across my mind, In thronging haste fast pressing on they bid The portals open to the viewless wind; That comes not, save when in the dust is laid The crown of pride that gilds each mortal brow, And from before man's vision melting fade The heavens and earthâTheir walls are falling nowâ Fast crowding on each thought claims utterance strong, Storm-lifted waves swift rushing to the shore On from the sea they send their shouts along, Back through the cave-worn rocks their thunders roar, And I a child of God by Christ made free Start from death's slumbers to eternity. Poem No. 722; September 1838 The Journey To tell my journeys where I daily walk, These words thou hearst me use were given me; Give heed then, when with thee my soul would talk, That thou the path of peace it goes may see;â I know no where to turn, each step is new; No wish before me flies to point the way, But on I travel with no end in view, Save that from Him who leads I never stray; He knows it all; the turning of the road, Where this man lives, and that, He knows it well; And finds for me at night a safe abode, Though I all houseless know not where to dwell; And canst thou tell then where my journeying lies? If so thou tread'st with me the same blue skies. Poem No. 741; early to mid-September 1838 âIn Him we live, &amp; move, &amp; have our beingâ Father! I bless thy name that I do live And in each motion am made rich with thee That when a glance is all that I can give It is a kingdom's wealth, if I but see; This stately body cannot move, save I Will to its nobleness my little bring, My voice its measured cadence will not try Save I with every note consent to sing; I cannot raise my hands to hurt or bless But I with every action must conspire; To show me there how little I possess And yet that little more than I desire; May each new act my new allegiance prove Till in thy perfect love I ever live &amp; move. Poem No. 120; c. 10 November 1838 Enoch I looked to find a man who walked with God, Like the translated patriarch of old;â Though gladdened millions on his footstool trod, Yet none with him did such sweet converse hold; I heard the wind in low complaint go by That none his melodies like him could hear; Day unto day spoke wisdom from on high, Yet none like David turned a willing ear; God walked alone unhonored through the earth; For him no heart-built temple open stood, The soul forgetful of her nobler birth Had hewn him lofty shrines of stone and wood, And left unfinished and in ruins still The only temple he delights to fill. Poem No. 242; c. 10 November 1838 The Son Father! I wait thy wordâthe sun doth stand, Beneath the mingling line of night and day, A listening servant waiting thy command To roll rejoycing on its silent way; The tongue of time abides the appointed hour, Till on our ear its solemn warnings fall; The heavy cloud withholds the pelting shower, Then every drop speeds onward at thy call; The bird reposes on the yielding bough With breast unswollen by the tide of song; So does my spirit wait thy presence now To pour thy praise in quickening life along Chiding with voice divine man's lengthened sleep, While round the Unuttered Word and Love their vigils keep. Poem No. 122; c. 17 November 1838 Love I asked of Time to tell me where was Love; He pointed to her foot-steps on the snow, Where first the angel lighted from above, And bid me note the way and onward go; Through populous streets of cities spreading wide, By lonely cottage rising on the moor, Where bursts from sundered cliff the struggling tide, To where it hails the sea with answering roar, She led me on; o'er mountains' frozen head, Where mile on mile still stretches on the plain, Then homeward whither first my feet she led I traced her path along the snow again, But there the sun had melted from the earth The prints where first she trod, a child of mortal birth. Poem No. 213; c. 17 November 1838 Day Day I lament that none can hymn thy praise In fitting strains, of all thy riches bless; Though thousands sport them in thy golden rays Yet none like thee their Maker's name confess; Great fellow of my being! woke with me Thou dost put on thy dazzling robes of light, And onward from the east go forth to free Thy children from the bondage of the night; I hail thee, pilgrim! on thy lonely way, Whose looks on all alike benignant shine; A child of light, like thee, I cannot stay, But on the world I bless must soon decline, Nor leave one ray to cheer the darkening mind That will not in the word of God its dayspring find. Poem No. 98; c. 24 November 1838 Night I thank thee, Father, that the night is near When I this conscious being may resign; Whose only task thy words of love to hear, And in thy acts to find each act of mine; A task too great to give a child like me, Thy myriad-handed labors of the day Too many for my closing eyes to see, Thy words too frequent for my tongue to say; Yet when thou see'st me burthened by thy love Each other gift more lovely then appears, For dark-robed night comes hovering from above And all thine other gifts to me endears; And while within her darkened couch I sleep, Thine eyes untired above will constant vigils keep. Poem No. 275; c. 24 November 1838 The Coming The day beginsâit comesâthe appointed day! No trumpet sounds, no shouts proclaim its birth; Yet brighter still, and brighter beams its ray Upon the mourning tribes that fill the earth. He comes! The Son of Man is glorified! Crowned with his Father's glory he appears; And they that scorned, and they that pierced his side, Before him bow their faces wet with tears. He comes! his peace, his promised peace to give, In robes of righteousness to clothe the poor; And bid them ever in his presence live, Heirs of the Kingdom that must aye endure; Priests, born to lead the long lost tribes of men Back to the fold of God in joy again. Poem No. 482; c. 1 December 1838 The Morning Watch 'Tis near the morning watch, the dim lamp burns But scarcely shows how dark the slumbering street; No sound of life the silent mart returns; No friends from house to house their neighbors greet; It is the sleep of death; a deeper sleep Than e'er before on mortal eyelids fell; No stars above the gloom their places keep; No faithful watchmen of the morning tell; Yet still they slumber on, though rising day Hath through their windows poured the awakening light; Or, turning in their sluggard trances, sayâ âThere yet are many hours to fill the night;â They rise not yet; while on the bridegroom goes 'Till he the day's bright gates forever on them close! Poem No. 725; c. 1 December 1838 The Weary and Heavy Laden Rejoice ye weary! ye whose spirits mourn! There is a rest that shall not be removed; Press on and reach within the heavenly bourn, By Christ the king of your salvation proved; There is a rest! Rejoice ye silent stars, Roll on no more all voiceless on your way; Thou Sun! no more dark clouds thy triumph mars, Speak thou to every land the coming day: It comes! bid every harp and timbrel sound; Bring forth the fatted calf; make merry all; For this the son was lost, and he is found; Was dead, and yet has heard his Savior's call; And comes within to drink the new made wine, And as a branch abide forever in the Vine. Poem No. 406; c. 8 December 1838 The Garden I saw the spot where our first parents dwelt; And yet it wore to me no face of change, For while amid its fields and groves I felt As if I had not sinned, nor thought it strange; My eye seemed but a part of every sight, My ear heard music in each sound that rose, Each sense forever found a new delight, Such as the spirit's vision only knows; Each act some new and ever-varying joy Did by my Father's love for me prepare; To dress the spot my ever fresh employ, And in the glorious whole with Him to share; No more without the flaming gate to stray, No more for sin's dark stain the debt of death to pay. Poem No. 264; c. 8 December 1838 The Song When I would sing of crooked streams and fields, On, on from me they stretch too far and wide, And at their look my song all powerless yields, And down the river bears me with its tide; Amid the fields I am a child again, The spots that then I loved I love the more, My fingers drop the strangely-scrawling pen, And I remember nought but nature's lore; I plunge me in the river's cooling wave, Or on the embroidered bank admiring lean, Now some endangered insect life to save, Now watch the pictured flowers and grasses green; Forever playing where a boy I played, By hill and grove, by field and stream delayed. Poem No. 789; c. 8 December 1838 The Spirit Land Father! thy wonders do not singly stand, Nor far removed where feet have seldom strayed; Around us ever lies the enchanted land In marvels rich to thine own sons displayed; In finding thee are all things round us found; In losing thee are all things lost beside; Ears have we but in vain strange voices sound, And to our eyes the vision is denied; We wander in the country far remote, Mid tombs and ruined piles in death to dwell; Or on the records of past greatness dote, And for a buried soul the living sell; While on our path bewildered falls the night That ne'er returns us to the fields of light. Poem No. 126; c. 15 December 1838 The Slave I saw him forging link by link his chain, Yet while he felt its length he thought him free, And sighed for those borne o'er the barren main To bondage that to his would freedom be; Yet on he walked with eyes far-gazing still On wrongs that from his own dark bosom flowed, And while he thought to do his master's will He but the more his disobedience showed; I heard a wild rose by the stony wall, Whose fragrance reached me in the passing gale, A lesson giveâit gave alike to allâ And I repeat the moral of its tale, âThat from the spot where deep its dark roots grew Bloomed forth the fragrant rose that all delight to view.â Poem No. 258; c. 15 December 1838 The Bread from Heaven Long do we live upon the husks of corn, While 'neath untasted lie the kernels still, Heirs of the kingdom, but in Christ unborn, Fain with swine's food would we our hunger fill; We eat but 'tis not of the bread from heaven; We drink but 'tis not from the stream of life; Our swelling actions want the little leaven To make them with the sighed-for blessing rife; We wait unhappy on a stranger's board, While we the master's friend by right should live, Enjoy with him the fruits our labors stored, And to the poor with him the pittance give; No more to want, the long expected heir With Christ the Father's love for evermore to share. Poem No. 319; c. 15 December 1838 The Latter Rain The latter rain, it falls in anxious haste Upon the sun-dried fields and branches bare, Loosening with searching drops the rigid waste As if it would each root's lost strength repair; But not a blade grows green as in the spring, No swelling twig puts forth its thickening leaves; The robins only mid the harvests sing Pecking the grain that scatters from the sheaves; The rain falls stillâthe fruit all ripened drops, It pierces chestnut burr and walnut shell, The furrowed fields disclose the yellow crops, Each bursting pod of talents used can tell, And all that once received the early rain Declare to man it was not sent in vain. Poem No. 518; c. 15 December 1838 The Word The Word! it cannot fail; it ever speaks; Unheard by all save by the sons of heaven, It waits, while time counts on the appointed weeks, The purpose to fulfill for which 'twas given; Unchangeable its ever-fixed command; When human feet would from its precepts stray It points their pathway with its flaming hand, And bids them keep the strait and narrow way; And when by its unerring counsels led The child would seek again his Father's face, Upon its stores of heavenly manna fed He gains at length through grief his resting place; And hears its praise from angels' countless throng, And joins forever in the new-raised song. Poem No. 598; c. 15 December 1838 Worship There is no worship nowâthe idol stands Within the spirit's holy resting place; Millions before it bend with upraised hands, And with their gifts God's purer shrine disgrace; The prophet walks unhonored mid the crowd That to the idol's temple daily throng; His voice unheard above their voices loud, His strength too feeble 'gainst the torrent strong; But there are bounds that ocean's rage can stay When wave on wave rush madly to the shore; And soon the prophet's word shall men obey, And hushed to peace the billows cease to roar; For he who spokeâand warring winds keep peace, Commands againâand man's wild passions cease. Poem No. 630; c. 15 December 1838 The Living God There is no death with Thee! each plant and tree In living haste their stems push onward still, The pointed blade, each rooted trunk we see In various movement all attest thy will; The vine must die when its long race is run, The tree must fall when it no more can rise; The worm has at its root his task begun, And hour by hour his steady labor plies; Nor man can pause but in thy will must grow, And, as his roots within more deep extend, He shall o'er sons of sons his branches throw, And to the latest born his shadows lend; Nor know in thee disease nor length of days, But lift his head forever in thy praise. Poem No. 619; c. 22 December 1838 Time There is no moment but whose flight doth bring Bright clouds and fluttering leaves to deck my bower, And I within like some sweet bird must sing To tell the story of the passing hour; For time has secrets that no bird has sung, Nor changing leaf with changing season told; But waits the utterance of some nobler tongue, Like that which spoke in prophet tones of old; Then day and night and month and year shall tell The tale that speaks but faint from bird and bough; In spirit songs their praise shall upward swell, Nor longer pass heaven's gate unheard as now; But cause e'en angels' ears to catch the strain, And send it back to earth in joy again. Poem No. 622; c. 22 December 1838 The Violet Thou tellest truths unspoken yet by man By this thy lonely home and modest look; For he has not the eyes such truths to scan, Nor learns to read from such a lowly book; With him it is not life firm-fixed to grow Beneath the outspreading oaks and rising pines, Content this humble lot of thine to know, The nearest neighbor of the creeping vines; Without fixed root he cannot trust like thee The rain will know the appointed hour to fall, But fears lest sun or shower may hurtful be, And would delay or speed them with his call; Nor trust like thee when wintry winds blow cold, Whose shrinking form the withered leaves enfold. Poem No. 699; mid-September to mid-December 1838 The Heart There is a cup of sweet or bitter drink, Whose waters ever o'er the brim must well, Whence flow pure thoughts of love as angels think, Or of its daemon depths the tongue will tell; That cup can ne'er be cleansed from outward stains While from within the tide forever flows; And soon it wearies out the fruitless pains The treacherous hand on such a task bestows; But ever bright its crystal sides appear, While runs the current from its outlet pure; And pilgrims hail its sparkling waters near, And stoop to drink the healing fountain sure, And bless the cup that cheers their fainting soul While through this parching waste they seek their heavenly goal. Poem No. 612; mid-September to mid-December 1838 The Trees of Life For those who worship Thee there is no death, For all they do is but with Thee to dwell; Now while I take from Thee this passing breath, It is but of thy glorious name to tell; Nor words nor measured sounds have I to find, But in them both my soul doth ever flow; They come as viewless as the unseen wind, And tell thy noiseless steps where'er I go; The trees that grow along thy living stream, And from its springs refreshment ever drink, Forever glittering in thy morning beam They bend them o'er the river's grassy brink, And as more high and wide their branches grow They look more fair within the depths below. Poem No. 132; mid-September to mid-December 1838 The Soldier of the Cross He was not armed like those of eastern clime, Whose heavy axes felled their heathen foe; Nor was he clad like those of later time, Whose breast-worn cross betrayed no cross below; Nor was he of the tribe of Levi born, Whose pompous rites proclaim how vain their prayer; Whose chilling words are heard at night and morn, Who rend their robes but still their hearts would spare; But he nor steel nor sacred robe had on, Yet went he forth in God's almighty power; He spoke the word whose will is ever done From day's first dawn till earth's remotest hour; And mountains melted from his presence down, And hell affrighted fled before his frown. Poem No. 168; mid-September to mid-December 1838 The Spirit I would not breathe, when blows thy mighty wind O'er desolate hill and winter-blasted plain, But stand in waiting hope if I may find Each flower recalled to newer life again; That now unsightly hide themselves from Thee, Amid the leaves or rustling grasses dry, With ice-cased rock and snowy-mantled tree Ashamed lest Thou their nakedness should spy; But Thou shalt breathe and every rattling bough Shall gather leaves; each rock with rivers flow; And they that hide them from thy presence now In new found robes along thy path shall glow, And meadows at thy coming fall and rise, Their green waves sprinkled with a thousand eyes. Poem No. 289; mid-September to mid-December 1838 The Serpent They knew that they were naked, and ashamed From Him who formed them stole themselves away, And when He spoke they each the other blamed, And death speaks living in each word they say; The serpent grows, a liar born within, Self-slaughter speaks in every uttered word, And earth is filled with temples built in sin, Where the foul tempter's praise is sung and heard; But soon the truth shall gain the listening ear, And from the lips in sacred utterance speak, And weary souls of Christ's own word shall hear, And in the living bread salvation seek, And Satan's reign on earth forever cease, And the new dawn begin of the eternal peace. Poem No. 642; mid-September to mid-December 1838 The Dead I see them crowd on crowd they walk the earth Dry, leafless trees no Autumn wind laid bare; And in their nakedness find cause for mirth, And all unclad would winter's rudeness dare; No sap doth through their clattering branches flow, Whence springing leaves and blossoms bright appear; Their hearts the living God have ceased to know, Who gives the spring time to th'expectant year; They mimic life, as if from him to steal His glow of health to paint the livid cheek; They borrow words for thoughts they cannot feel, That with a seeming heart their tongue may speak; And in their show of life more dead they live Than those that to the earth with many tears they give. Poem No. 266; mid-September to mid-December 1838 The Presence I sit within my room and joy to find That Thou who always loves art with me here, That I am never left by Thee behind, But by Thyself Thou keepst me ever near; The fire burns brighter when with Thee I look, And seems a kinder servant sent to me; With gladder heart I read thy holy book, Because Thou art the eyes by which I see; This aged chair, that table, watch, and door Around in ready service ever wait; Nor can I ask of Thee a menial more To fill the measure of my large estate, For Thou Thyself, with all a Father's care, Where'er I turn, art ever with me there. Poem No. 269; mid-September to mid-December 1838 The Lost They wander, straggling sheep without a fold, Called here and there by falsely-guiding cries; No hands from them the slaughtering wolves withhold, But one by one each hireling shepherd flies; They wander on, but not a blade of green Blesses the sight along the scorching sand; No spring-fed stream with living voice is seen Still gliding on companion of their band; But soon their weary pilgrimage shall close, And the good shepherd guide their feet in peace; For all its paths his eye experienced knows, And at each step their joys in him increase, Till welcomed there where he in honor reigns He at his Father's board each faithful son sustains. Poem No. 651; mid-September to mid-December 1838 The Robe Each naked branch, the yellow leaf or brown, The rugged rock, and death-deformed plain Lies white beneath the winter's feathery down, Nor doth a spot unsightly now remain; On sheltering roof, on man himself it falls; But him no robe, not spotless snow makes clean; For 'neath his corse-like spirit ever calls, That on it too may fall the heavenly screen; But all in vain, its guilt can never hide From the quick spirit's heart-deep searching eye, There barren plains, and caverns yawning wide Must e'er lay naked to the passer by; Nor can one thought deformed its presence shun, But to the spirit's gaze stands bright as in the sun. Poem No. 103; mid-September to mid-December 1838 The Will Help me in Christ to learn to do Thy will, That I may have from him eternal life; And here on earth thy perfect love fulfill, Then home return victorious from the strife; This war in heaven must every foe cast down, And bruise the serpent's star-exalted pride; And gain for me the lyre and martyr-crown To all who love the praise of men denied; To do thy will shall bring that day of rest, When none can work save those who work with Thee; And in thy labors evermore are blest, From death and sin through Christ forever free; Beloved by Thee thy children to remain, Made priests, and kings, and heirs of thy domain. Poem No. 169; mid-September to mid-December 1838 The War I saw a war yet none the trumpet blew, Nor in their hands the steel-wrought weapons bare; And in that conflict armed there fought but few, And none that in the world's loud tumults share; They fought against their wills, the stubborn foe That mail-clad warriors left unfought within; And wordy champions leave unslain below, The ravening wolf though drest in fleecy skin; They fought for peace; not that the world can give, Whose tongue proclaims the war its hands have ceased; And bids us as each other's neighbour live, When John within our breasts has not decreased; They fought for him whose kingdom must increase Good will to men, on earth forever peace. Poem No. 256; mid-September to mid-December 1838 Life It is not life upon Thy gifts to live, But still with deeper roots grow fixed in Thee; And when the sun and shower their bounties give To send out thick-leaved limbs; a fruitful tree, Whose green head meets the eye for many a mile, Where moss-grown trunks their rigid branches rear, And full-faced fruit their blushing welcome smile As to its goodly shade our feet draw near; Who tastes its gifts shall never hunger more, For 'tis the Father spreads the pure repast, Who while we eat renews the ready store, That at his bounteous board must ever last; For none the bridegroom's supper shall attend, Who will not hear and make his word their friend. Poem No. 306; mid-September to mid-December 1838 The Reaper There are no reapers in the whitening fields, But many preying on the ripening ears Forever scatter all the harvest yields, Planted with toil and wet with many tears; Eagles they are that on the carcase feed, Not gather with the hand that plants the grain; With ravening beak they tear the hearts that bleed, And with their talons aggravate the pain; But soon the Husbandman his heirs shall send, Who from the tares shall cull the heavy wheat; Then from the heaven the son too shall descend, And with his welcome every laborer greet, And give the weary ones his peace, his rest, And to the feast invite each ransomed soul, a guest. Poem No. 608; mid-September to mid-December 1838 Simmons Mobile Alabama O may I see thy face for without thee The day returns but round no brightness pours The light returns I see thy face againâ Poem No. 376; mid-September to mid-December 1838 Winter There is a winter in the godless heart More cold than that which creeps upon the year That will not with the opening spring depart But freezes on though summer's heats are near Its blasts are words that chill the loving soul Though heard in pleasing phrase or learned sound Their killing breath nor thriple folds control They pierce within though flesh &amp; blood surround How dead the heart whence drives the arrowy shower The full blown rose hangs drooping at its breath The bursting buds of promise feel its power And fixed stand incased in icy death And e'en the soul which Christ's warm tears fill Its sleety accents falling thick can chill. Poem No. 616; mid-September to mid-December 1838 John What went ye out to see? a shaken reed? In him whose voice proclaims âprepare the wayâ; Behold the oak that stormy centuries feed! Though but the buried acorn of my day; What went ye out to see? a kingly man? In the soft garments clothed that ye have worn; Behold a servant whom the hot suns tan, His raiment from the rough-haired camel torn! Ye seek ye know not what; blind children all, Who each his idle fancy will demand; Nor heed my true-sent prophet's warning call, That you may learn of me the new command; And see the Light that cometh down from heaven, Repent! and see, while yet its light is given. Poem No. 781; late 1838âearly 1839 The Flight Come forth, come forth my people from the place Where ye have lived so many days secure; I will destroy within the wicked race, Their walls of brass and stone shall not endure; They fall! escape! flee fast! the foe is near! Stop not to take your clothes! escape for life! Be wise, and of my love-sent message hear! For swift descends the day with sorrows rife, Escape! the word is near you in your heart; Obey within, and make my pathway strait; Hasten! from all your sinful ways depart, And enter through the strait and narrow gate; Be warned and flee, the morning watch is spent, And but a moment for your flight is lent. Poem No. 90; late 1838âearly 1839 The Priest Grant me forever of thy word to hear, And live by that which ever speaks from heaven; That gives the love that knows not of a fear, For by the gift is every sin forgiven; Then shall I be, by him who leads me on, A priest to still the people's wave-tost breast; And when the storm of passion's wrath is gone Conduct them to the haven of their rest; Then shall my master hail me as his friend; The friend of all the weary ones and poor, And when I faint, his promised peace shall send; In every wound pour oil and wine to cure; Still beckoning on, till in his Father's peace He bids my toil and pain forever cease. Poem No. 153; late 1838âearly 1839 The Resurrection The dead! the dead! they throw their grave clothes by, And burst the prisons where they long have lain; I hear them send their shouts of triumph high, For he the king of terrors now is slain; I see them; see! the dumb have found a voice; The lame are leaping where they crawled before; The blind with eyes of wonder see rejoice; The deaf stand listening to the glad uproar; Look! each the other as a brother sees; Hark! each the other welcomes to his home; There are no tones of chilling breath to freeze, No tears are dropt, no sufferers here can moan; The joy of love o'er every feature plays, And every new-born child rejoices in its rays. Poem No. 488; late 1838âearly 1839 My Father's House My Father's house, I find no entrance there; But those who buy and sell block up the way, And that which should be called âthe house of prayer,â Is filled with those whose spirits never pray; Father! accept my prayer that they may see, Nor in thy presence dwell by Thee unknown; Open their eyes that they may look on Thee, And all thy love for disobedience own; Be this the heaviest scourge to drive them hence, And may thy word with gentle force persuade; I need no sword but this for my defence, It speaks; and by the dead shall be obeyed; And thy new temple from pollution freed Be filled by those who love in truth and deed. Poem No. 336; late 1838âearly 1839 The Servant The servant Thou hast called stands ready shod, Clean through thy holy word, in Christ made free, To smite the nations with an iron rod, That haply they may turn and worship Thee;â Their broken idols own thy spirit's power; The strong men bow, and at its word lie bound; The lying spirits start to hear the hour Through all their depths its solemn warning sound; Nor horse nor chariot now avail for flight, Thy hand is on the courser's flowing rein; The night unrobed stands guilty in thy sight, And for a covering pleads, but pleads in vain;â Through all that waits thy servant bid him stand, And by thy love supported gain the promised land. Poem No. 558; late 1838âearly 1839 I Was Sick And In Prison Thou hast not left the rough-barked tree to grow Without a mate upon the river's bank; Nor dost Thou on one flower the rain bestow, But many a cup the glittering drops have drank; The bird must sing to one who sings again, Else would her note less welcome be to hear; Nor hast Thou bid thy word descend in vain, But soon some answering voice shall reach my ear; Then shall the brotherhood of peace begin, And the new song be raised that never dies; That shall the soul from death and darkness win, And burst the prison where the captive lies; And one by one new-born shall join the strain, Till earth restores her sons to heaven again. Poem No. 680; late 1838âearly 1839 He Was Acquainted With Grief I cannot tell the sorrows that I feel By the night's darkness, by the prison's gloom; There is no sight that can the death reveal, The spirit suffers in earth's living tomb; There is no sound of grief that mourners raise, No moaning of the wind, or dirge-like sea; Nor hymns though prophet tones inspire the lays, That can the spirit's grief awake in thee; Thou too must suffer as it suffers here, The death in Christ to know the Father's love; Then in the strains that angels love to hear, Thou too shalt hear the spirit's song above; And learn in grief what these can never tell, A note too deep for earthly voice to swell. Poem No. 223; c. January 1839 The Fragments I would weigh out my love with nicest care, Each moment shall make large the sum I give, That all who want may find yet some to share; And bless the crumb of bread that helps them live; Of thy rich stores how much has wasted been, Of all Thou giv'st me daily to divide; I will in future count it for my sin, If e'en a morsel from the poor I hide; Help me to give them all Thou giv'st to me, That I a faithful steward may be found; That I may give a good account to Thee, Of all the seed Thou sowest in my ground; That nought of all Thou givest may remain, That can a hungry soul in life sustain. Poem No. 293; c. January 1839 The Winter Rain The rain comes down, it comes without our call; Each pattering drop knows well its destined place, And soon the fields whereon the blessings fall, Shall change their frosty look for Spring's sweet face; So fall the words thy Holy Spirit sends, Upon the heart where Winter's robe is flung; They shall go forth as certain of their ends, As the wet drops from out thy vapors wrung; Spring will not tarry, though more late its rose Shall bud and bloom upon the sinful heart; Yet when it buds, forever there it blows, And hears no Winter bid its bloom depart; It strengthens with his storms, and grows more bright, When o'er the earth is cast his mantle white. Poem No. 548; c. January 1839 Forbearance The senseless drops can feel no pain, as they In ceaseless measure strike the barren ground; But o'er its trodden surface constant play, Without a pang that there no life is found; Yet oft the word must fall on stony fields, And where the weeds have shot their rankness high; And nought the seed to him who sows it yields, But bitter tears and the half-uttered sigh; But these are rife with precious stores of love, For him who bears them daily in his breast; For so the Father bids him hence remove, And so attain His everlasting rest; For thus He bore with thee when thou wast blind, And so He bids thee bear wouldst thou his presence find. Poem No. 557; c. January 1839 The Wolf and the Lamb Shall Feed Together The wolf, why heeds he not the sportive lamb, But lies at rest beside him on the plain? The lion feeds beside the browsing ram, The tyger's rage is curbed without a chain; The year of peace has on the earth begun! And see ye not bestowed the promised sign, The prophets by the spirit moved have sung, To close the world's long strife with day benign? Look not abroad, it comes not with the eye; Nor can the ear its welcome tidings hear; Nor seek ye Christ below, nor yet on high, Behold the Word to thee is also near; E'en at thy heart it speaks, Repent! Obey! And thine eye too shall hail the rising day. Poem No. 596; c. January 1839 The Rail Road Thou great proclaimer to the outward eye, Of what the spirit too would seek to tell, Onward thou go'st, appointed from on high The other warnings of the Lord to swell; Thou art the voice of one that through the world Proclaims in startling tones, âprepare the way;â The lofty mountain from its seat is hurled, The flinty rocks thine onward march obey; The valleys lifted from their lowly bed O'ertop the hills that on them frowned before, Thou passest where the living seldom tread, Through forests dark, where tides beneath thee roar, And bidst man's dwelling from thy track remove, And would with warning voice his crooked paths reprove. Poem No. 677; c. January 1839 Behold He Is at Hand That Doth Betray Me Why come you out to me with clubs and staves, That you on every side have fenced me so? In every act you dig for me deep graves; In which my feet must walk where'er I go; You speak and in your words my death I find, Pierced through with many sorrows to the core; And none that will the bleeding spirit bind, But at each touch still freer flows the gore; But with my stripes your deep-dyed sins are healed, For I must show my master's love for you; The cov'nant that he made, forever sealed, By blood is witnessed to be just and true; And you in turn must bear the stripes I bear, And in his sufferings learn alike to share. Poem No. 818; c. January 1839 The Fruit Thou ripenest the fruits with warmer air, That Summer brings around thy goodly trees; And Thou wilt grant a summer to my prayer, And fruit shall glisten from these fluttering leaves; A fruit that shall not with the winter fail, He knows no winter who of it shall eat; But on it lives though outward storm assail, Till it becomes in time his daily meat; Then he shall in the fruit I give abound, And hungry pilgrims hasten to the bough; Where the true bread of life shall then be found, Though nought they spy to give upon it now; But pass it by, with sorrowing hearts that there But leaves have grown where they the fruit would share. Poem No. 691; c. January 1839 To Him That Hath Shall Be Given Why readest thou? thou canst not gain the life The spirit leads, but by the spirit's toil; The labor of the body is not strife, Such as will give to thee the wine and oil; To him who hath, to him my verse shall give, And he the more from all he does shall gain; The spirit's life he too shall learn to live, And share on earth in hope the spirit's pain; Be taught of God; none else can learn thee aught; He will thy steps forever lead aright, The life is all that He his sons has taught, Obey within, and thou shalt see its light; And gather from its beams a brighter ray, To cheer thee on along thy doubtful way. Poem No. 824; c. January 1839 The Thorns I cannot find thy flowers, they have not blown, The cruel winter will not let them live; The seed in every heart thy hand has sown, Yet none will back to Thee the blossom give; Their roots without the bosom daily grow, And every branch blooms inward and unseen; The hidden roots unsightly length they show, And hide the limbs that thou has clothed with green; They will not like the plants that own thy care, The heavy laden boughs extend to all; They will not of the flowers Thou giv'st them share, But drink the rain that on their bosoms fall, And nought return but prickly briar and thorn, That from the enclosed heart thy children warn. Poem No. 219; c. January 1839 The River Oh swell my bosom deeper with thy love, That I some river's widening mouth may be; And ever on for many a mile above May flow the floods that enter from thy sea; And may they not retreat as tides of earth, Save but to show from Thee that they have flown, Soon may my spirit find that better birth, Where the retiring wave is never known; But Thou dost flow through every channel wide, With all a Father's love in every soul; A stream that knows no ebb, a swelling tide That rolls forever on and finds no goal, Till in the hearts of all shall opened be The Ocean depths of thine Eternity. Poem No. 388; c. January 1839 The New Jerusalem I saw the city, 'twas not built by hands, And nought impure can ever enter in, 'Twas built by those who keep the Lord's commands, And in his blood have washed away their sin; Thrice happy those who see the pearly gate Before their earthly vision distant rise; And keep the path though narrow still and strait Through many a thorny hedge their journey lies; Behold within the mansion of thy rest! Prepared by him who in it went before, Behold the peace that makes the spirit blest! By him who loved thee kept for thee in store; Press on, the crown he won shall soon be thine, And thou amid the just a star in heaven shall shine. Poem No. 262; c. January 1839 The Cross I must go on, till in my tearful line Walks the full spirit's love as I on earth; Till I can all Thou giv'st again resign, And he be formed in me who gave me birth; Wilt Thou within me bruise the serpent's heel, That I through Christ the victory may win; Then shall the peace the blessed in him must feel, Within my bosom here on earth begin; Help me to grasp through him eternal life, That must by conflict here by me be wrought; With all his faith still aid me in the strife, Till I through blood like him the prize have bought; And I shall hang upon the accursed tree, Pierced through with many spears that all may see. Poem No. 249; c. January 1839 Nature Nature would speak through her first master man, He will not heed her kindly calling voice; He does not call her name as he began, For in his Maker he cannot rejoice; Yet still she woos him back with many a call, That e'en his nature finds it hard to spurn; And would surrender to his asking all That now with anxious toil he scarce can earn; She pleads, but pleads in vain; He will not hear, But o'er her holds the rod his passions gave; And thinks she will obey through coward fear, And be like him of her own self the slave; But ever fresh she rises 'neath his rod, For she obeys in love her sovereign God. Poem No. 350; c. January 1839 Ye Gave Me No Meat My brother, I am hungry, give me food; Such as my Father gives me at his board; He has for many years been to thee good, Thou canst a morsel then to me afford; I do not ask of thee a grain of that Thou offerest, when I call on thee for bread; This is not of the wine nor olive fat, But those who eat of this like thee are dead; I ask the love the Father has for thee, That thou should'st give it back to me again; This shall my soul from pangs of hunger free, And on my parched spirit fall like rain; Then thou wilt prove a brother to my need, For in the cross of Christ thou too canst bleed. Poem No. 334; c. January 1839 Day Unto Day Uttereth Speech I would adorn the day and give it voice, That it should sing with praises meet for Thee; For none but man can bid it so rejoice, That it shall seem a joyful day to me; Break forth ye hearts that frozen winters bind In icy chains more strong than close the year! Look up! the day, the day, ye suffering blind! Ye deaf, its notes of welcome come and hear! Bid it the joy your hearts have long supprest, Give back to you in new awakening strains; To rouse the sinful from their guilty rest, And break the captive's more than iron chains; It shall arise with healing in its beams, And wake the nations from their lengthened dreams. Poem No. 286; c. January 1839 Labor and Rest Thou needst not rest, the shining spheres are thine, That roll perpetual on their silent way; And thou dost breathe in me a voice divine, That tells more sure of thine Eternal sway; Thine the first starting of the early leaf, The gathering green, the changing autumn hue; To Thee the world's long years are but as brief, As the fresh tints the spring will soon renew; Thou needest not man's little life of years, Save that he gather wisdom from them all; That in thy fear he lose all other fears, And in thy calling heed no other call; Then shall he be thy child to know thy care, And in thy glorious self the eternal sabbath share. Poem No. 687; c. January 1839 The Disciple Thou wilt my hands employ, though others find No work for those who praise thy name aright; And in their worldly wisdom call them blind, Whom Thou hast blest with thine own spirit's sight; But while they find no work for Thee to do, And blindly on themselves alone rely; Thy child must suffer what Thou sufferest too, And learn from him Thou sent e'en so to die; Thou art my Father, Thou wilt give me aid To bear the wrong the spirit suffers here; Thou hast thy help upon the mighty laid, In him I trust, nor know to want or fear; But ever onward walk secure from sin, For he has conquered every foe within. Poem No. 703; c. January 1839 The Mountain Thou shalt the mountain move; be strong in me, And I will pluck it from its rocky base, And cast it headlong in the rolling sea, And men shall seek but shall not find its place; Be strong; thou shalt throw down the numerous host, That rises now against thee o'er the earth; Against thy Father's arm they shall not boast, In sorrow shall grow dark their day of mirth; Lift up the banner, bid the trumpets sound, Gather ye nations on the opposing hill! I will your wisest councils now confound, And all your ranks with death and slaughter fill; I come for judgment, and for victory now, Bow down ye nations! at my footstool bow! Poem No. 694; c. January 1839 The Mustard Seed Plant the small seed, the mustard grain within, And it shall spread its limbs from shore to shore; But first it must in smallest root begin, And seem to yield too little for thy store; But thou hast sparing sown, it cannot grow When thou dost not thy field in order keep; Wilt thou no rain or sun on it bestow, And think a plenteous harvest thou shalt reap? Not so the earth rewards the farmer's toil; Not so the heart will yield its rich increase; Wouldst thou in time partake the wine and oil, Wouldst thou within thee find the promised peace, Sow daily, sow within the precious seed, And thou shalt find rich crops in time of need. Poem No. 398; c. January 1839 Eden Thy service Father! wants not aught beside The peace and joy it to thy servant brings; By day in Christ a constant prayer t'abide, By night to sleep beneath thy outspread wings; To keep thy ground from thorns and poisonous weeds, That Thou might'st sow in me the fruitful word; Is all Thou ask'st, is all thy goodness needs, This the command that Adam from Thee heard; Oh may I better serve Thee, Lord! than he, And may my garden be forever clean; From noisome weeds, unsightly branches free, Within it may thy Presence still be seen; And wilt Thou speak with me forevermore, And I forget to sin as I have sinned before. Poem No. 716; c. January 1839 My meat and drink I do not need thy food, but thou dost mine; For this will but the body's wants repair, And soon again for meat like this 'twill pine, And so be fed by thee with daily care; But that which I can give thou needs but eat, And thou shalt find it in thyself to be; Forever formed within a living meat, On which to feed will make thy spirit free; Thou shalt not hunger more, for freely given The bread on which the spirit daily feeds; This is the bread that cometh down from heaven, Of which who eats no other food he needs; But this doth grow within him day by day, Increasing more the more he takes away. Poem No. 226; c. January 1839 Forgive me my trespasses Thy trespasses my heart has not forgiven, To the full answer that my Lord would ask; The love in him to me so freely given, Is for my feeble strength too great a task; Increase oh Father! swell the narrowing tide, Till the full stream shall reach from shore to shore; I have not yet each sinful thought denied, Heal up for me the freshly bleeding sore, Let me not waste the life my Savior gave, On the vile lusts that war against the soul; May sin in him forever find its grave, And all my being own his just controul; And fixed forever in his perfect law, May I more freely from thy fountain draw. Poem No. 718; c. January 1839 The Star Thou mak'st me poor that I enriched by Thee May tell thy love to those who know it not; And rise within thy heavens a star to be, When they thine earthly suns have all forgot; Grant that my light may through their darkness shine, With increased splendour from the parent source; A diamond fashioned by the hand divine To hold forever on its measured course; But I am dark as yet, but soon the light Of thy bright morning star on me shall dawn; Sure herald that the curtain of the night, Forever from my orb shall be withdrawn; And its pure beams thy rays shall ever boast, Shining accepted mid the starry host. Poem No. 685; c. January 1839 The Watchman I place thee as a watchman on a tower, That thou mayst warn the city of the dead; The day has come, and come the appointed hour, When through their streets my herald's feet shall tread; Prepare ye all my supper to attend! I have prepared it long that you might eat; Come in, and I will treat you as a friend, And of the living bread shall be your meat; Oh come, and tarry not; for yours shall be The honored seats around your Father's board; And you my sons, your master's face shall see, And to my love forever be restored; And you my promises to Abr'am given Shall find fulfilled to all his seed in heaven. Poem No. 250; c. January 1839 The Prison The prison house is full, there is no cell But hath its prisoner laden with his chains; And yet they live as though their life was well, Nor of its burthening sin the soul complains; Thou dost not see where thou hast lived so long, The place is called the skull where thou dost tread; Why laugh you then, why sing the sportive song, As if you lived, and knowest not thou art dead; Yes thou art dead; the morn breaks o'er thee now, Where is thy Father, He who gave thee birth? Thou art a severed limb, a barren bough, Thou sleepest in deep caverns of the earth; Awake! thou hast a glorious race to run, Put on thy strength, thou hast not yet begun. Poem No. 544; c. January 1839 The Prophet The Prophet speaks, the world attentive stands! The voice that stirs the people's countless host, Issues again the Living God's commands; And who before the King of Kings can boast? At his rebuke behold a thousand flee, Their hearts the Lord hath smitten with his fear; Bow to the Christ ye nations! bow the knee! Repent! the kingdom of the son is near! Deep on their souls the mighty accents fall, Like lead that pierces through the walls of clay; Pricked to the heart the guilty spirits call To know of him the new, the living way; They bow; for he can loose, and he can bind; And in his path the promised blessing find. Poem No. 546; c. January 1839 The Flood I cannot eat my bread; the people's sins Call for a day of fasting on my soul; For the great day of mourning now begins, The tears of shame adown their faces roll; Alas, can naught avert the coming gloom, That rises in the east a midnight cloud? No thunders burst to warn them of their doom, No faithful watchmen raise their voices loud; They eat, they drink, they marry still as then, When o'er the world the flood in fury rolled, Alas, the fire will fall upon the men, That are to sin and death in bondage sold; And they nor see, nor heed the coming flame, But perish all unsuccored in their shame. Poem No. 218; c. January 1839 The Corrupt Tree Fast from thine evil growing will within, Thou hast no other fast than this to keep; This is the root whence springs all other sin, This sows the tares while thou art sunk in sleep; Fast ever here, the voice must be obeyed That bids thee for the Lord prepare the way; Too long thine inward prayer has been delayed, Awake, and in thy soul forever pray; Cut down the tree that good fruit cannot bear, Why cumbers it for years the fertile ground? Let not a root the axe thou wieldest spare, Till it no more within thy field be found; Spare not, and thou shalt reap an hundred fold, And a new tree shall rise where thou hast felled the old. Poem No. 117; c. January 1839 The Pure in Heart Father, Thou wilt accept the pure in heart, And risest early that Thou mayest them see; And will not from them e'en at night depart, But in thy Presence bidst them always be; I would be holy, for 'tis written soâ The pure in heart shall see their Father's faceâ So would I journeying through trial go, And run with patience here the godly race; That I may see at last thy children pure, In that blest home where all is peace and love; Where Thou wilt make thy promise to me sure, That I may dwell with Christ and Thee above; Where nought impure can ever enter in, Oh may that peace on earth e'en now begin! Poem No. 125; c. January 1839 The Complaint It does my heart with deepest sorrow fill, That I no more thy praises can proclaim; To check the mighty tide of human ill, And bid thine offspring glorify thy name; By night and day my failings I lament, That draw me back from my full stature high; I cannot be with this cold love content, But must in Christ with nobler ardor try To be whate'er his full command requires; To show Thee, Father, by my borrowed light, And kindle up, amid the sinking fires, A sun to fill the darkness of the night; With rays from thine own glory ever thrown, That has from age to age on all thy children shone. Poem No. 305; c. January 1839 Whither shall I go from thy Spirit Where would I go from Thee? Thou lov'st me here With love the heaven of heavens cannot contain; Where can I go where Thou wilt not be near, Who doth from hour to hour my life sustain? I cannot leave Thee; Thou dost call me up, When the first blush of morn is on the sky; Thou mak'st my noon, at even bid'st me sup, And when I sleep I know that Thou art nigh; And what then can I want O Lord, but Thee? Thy word shall be henceforth my daily bread, From every other want it makes me free; I will for it my heart wide open spread; Till it shall enter there, and there abide, And cleanse thy temple with its healing tide. Poem No. 809; c. January 1839 The First shall be Last Bring forth, bring forth your silver! it shall be But as the dust that meets the passing eye; You shall from all your idols break, be free! And worship Him whose ear can hear your cry; Thou who hast hid within thy learned pelf, Thou who hast loved another wife than Me, Bring forth thine idols, they are born of self; And to thy Maker bow the willing knee; Each secret thing must now be brought to light, Make haste, the day breaks on your hidden spoil; Go, buy what then will give your soul delight, That day can never hurt the wine and oil; Make haste, the bridegroom knocks, he's at the door; The first must now be last, the last the first before. Poem No. 80; c. January 1839 The Laborer Father, I thank Thee that the day begins, And I within thy vineyard too am sent; That I may struggle on against my sins, And seek to double what to me is lent; Thou chast'nest me with false upbraiding word; From many a heart I'm rudely thrust away; That has not of the man of sorrows heard, Nor at thy inner temple learned to pray; Yet so the peace of Christ Thou mak'st me know, And in his sufferings rise at last to Thee; From glory on to glory still to go, Till I in him from all that binds me free Have fought the fight, the life Thou giv'st laid down, And at his hand received the robe and kingly crown. Poem No. 121; late 1838âearly 1839 Thy Brother's Blood I have no Brotherâthey who meet me now Offer a hand with their own wills defiled, And while they wear a smooth unwrinkled brow Know not that Truth can never be beguiled; Go wash the hand that still betrays thy guilt; Before the spirit's gaze what stain can hide? Abel's red blood upon the earth is spilt, And by thy tongue it cannot be denied; I hear not with the earâthe heart doth tell Its secret deeds to me untold before; Go, all its hidden plunder quickly sell, Then shalt thou cleanse thee from thy brother's gore; Then will I take thy giftâthat bloody stain Shall not be seen upon thy hand again. Poem No. 234; late 1838âearly 1839 The Graveyard My heart grows sick before the wide-spread death, That walks and speaks in seeming life around; And I would love the corse without a breath, That sleeps forgotten 'neath the cold, cold ground; For these do tell the story of decay, The worm and rotten flesh hide not nor lie; But this though dying too from day to day, With a false show doth cheat the longing eye; And hide the worm that gnaws the core of life, With painted cheek and smooth deceitful skin; Covering a grave with sights of darkness rife, A secret cavern filled with death and sin; And men walk o'er these graves and know it not, For in the body's health the soul's forgot. Poem No. 339; late 1838âearly 1839 Sacrifice Thou dost prefer the song that rises pure On lips, that speak the words the contrite feel; To all the hands, without the heart, procure, And on thine altar lay with soulless zeal; Thou dost not look to see the uplifted hands, Not hear'st our cry, save when we do thy will; But, when we keep, within, thy just commands, Our praises shall thy courts with incense fill. Ever it rises from the obedient heart, Hangs clustering from the lips in accents sweet; From which, who taste, unwillingly depart, Where thorny words with show of verdure cheat; But sit beneath the vine, and bless its shade, And Him, who, for their wants, such rich provision made. Poem No. 672; late 1838âearly 1839 The Son of Man The son of Man, where shall he find repose? Ever a homeless wanderer o'er the earth, No brother's there, no sister's love he knows, A stranger in the land that gave him birth; Who will receive the pilgrim on his way, The cup of water to his dry lips hold? A prophet's gift the welcome shall repay, For he a keeper is of Christ's own fold; He asks no pittance from your earthly store, He asks your will, your life to him be given; Give, and the life you lose he will restore, And lead you onward to the gates of heaven; Where waits a Father's love to crown your joy, And banish all the griefs that here annoy. Poem No. 568; late 1838âearly 1839 The Ark There is no change of time and place with Thee, Where'er I go with me 'tis still the same; Within thy presence I rejoice to be, And always hallow thy most holy name; The world doth ever change; there is no peace Among the shallows of its storm-vexed breast; With every breath the frothy waves increase, They toss up mire and dirt, they cannot rest; I thank Thee that within thy strong-built ark My soul across the uncertain sea can sail, And though the night of death be long and dark My hopes in Christ shall reach within the veil; And to the promised haven steady steer, Whose rest to those who love is ever near. Poem No. 618; late 1838âearly 1839 The Father Thou who first called me from the sleep of death, Thee may I ever as my Father love; In Thee my being find, in Thee my breath, And never from Thyself again remove; On Thee alone I wait, and Thee I serve; Thou art my morn, my noon, and evening hour; May I from thy commandments never swerve, So wilt Thou be to me a heavenly dower; Friends, brothers, wife, shall all be found in Thee, Children, whose love for me shall ne'er grow cold; And Thou the Father still o'er all shall be, In thine embrace thy children ever hold; In Christ awoke from death's forgotten sleep Thy hands from harm thy sons shall ever keep. Poem No. 700; late 1838âearly 1839 Rachel Where are my children, whom from youth I raised With all a parent's love and gentle care; That I might be by them forever praised, And they with Me in all I have might share? They have not known Me! see them bow the knee To stocks and stones their death has given life; And while enslaved rejoice that they are free, Married, yet not to Me their lawful wife; Turn, turn ye children, why then will ye die? Why will ye slight the offer of my rest? The day is near when vain will be your cry With the sharp sword and pestilence opprest; Turn, turn to Me and I will be your shield, Before the hour is come that has your slaughter sealed. Poem No. 801; late 1838âearly 1839 Christmas Awake ye dead! the summons has gone forth, That bids you leave the dark enclosing grave; From east to west 'tis heard, from south to north The word goes forth the imprisoned souls to save; Though ye have on the garments of the dead, And the fourth day have slept within the earth, Come forth! you shall partake the living bread, And be a witness of the spirit's birth; Awake ye faithful! throw your grave clothes by, He whom you seek is risen, he bids you rise; The cross again on earth is lifted high, Turn to its healing sight your closing eyes; And you shall rise and gird your armor on, And fight till you a crown in Christ have won. Poem No. 59; late 1838âearly 1839 The Earth I would lie low, the ground on which men tread, Swept by thy spirit like the wind of heaven; An earth where gushing springs and corn for bread By me at every season should be given; Yet not the water and the bread that now Supplies their tables with its daily food; But Thou wouldst give me fruit for every bough, Such as Thou givest me, and call'st it good; And water from the stream of life should flow, By every dwelling that thy love has built; Whose taste the ransomed of thy son shall know, Whose robes are washed from every stain of guilt; And men would own it was thy hand that blest, And from my bosom find a surer rest. Poem No. 288; late 1838âearly 1839 The Hours The minutes have their trusts as they go by, To bear His love who wings their viewless flight; To Him they bear their record as they fly, Nor from their ceaseless round can they alight; Rich with the life Thou liv'st they come to me, Oh may I all that life to others show; That they from strife may rise and rest in Thee, And all thy peace in Christ by me may know; Then shall the morning call me from my rest, With joyful hope that I thy child may live; And when the evening comes 'twill make me blest To know that I a night to others give; Such as thy peace does to thy children send, Will be the night that Thou by me would lend. Poem No. 526; late 1838âearly 1839 The Christ 'Tis not by water only but by blood Thou comest in the flesh, great Prince of Peace! John is thy witness in the cleansing flood, But thou art from above, and must increase; Thou bidst us suffer on the accursed tree, Where thou wast nailed for sins thou couldst not know; That by thy blood from death I might be free, And in thy kingly stature daily grow; Thou bidst me lose the life that thou hast given, As thou hast died for me and all before; And win the crown of light from thee in heaven, By wearing here the thorns thy temples wore; And loving as thou loved, who sweat within Great drops of blood unseen for unseen sin. Poem No. 728; late 1838âearly 1839 The Things Before I would not tarry, Look! the things before Call me along my path with beckoning love; The things I gain wear not the hues they wore, For brighter glories gild the heavens above; Still on, I seek the peace my master sought, The world cannot disturb his joy within; It is not with its gold and silver bought, It is the victory over death and sin; But those who enter the bright city's gate, Ride low on one the mocked and scorned of earth; But there the ready mansions open wait, For those who lived rejected from their birth; And he who went before them bids all hail! To those who o'er the world in him prevail. Poem No. 291; late 1838âearly 1839 The Cup The bitterness of death is on me now, Before me stands its dark unclosing door; Yet to thy will submissive still I bow, And follow him who for me went before; The tomb cannot contain me though I die, For his strong love awakes its sleeping dead; And bids them through himself ascend on high, To Him who is of all the living Head; I gladly enter through the gloomy walls, Where they have passed who loved their master here; The voice they heard, to me it onward calls, And can when faint my sinking spirit cheer; And from the joy on earth it now has given, Lead on to joy eternal in the heaven. Poem No. 467; late 1838âearly 1839 Old Things are passed away The old creation Thou hast formed is dead, The leaves are fallen from the lifeless tree, The broken branches at our feet are spread, And e'en the look of life begins to flee; Yet while Thou lets the horrid trunk arise, Thy children too can learn to bear with Thee; Thy love in Christ shall make them truly wise, And from its death their spirits ever free; Then shall the world unseen be brought to light, The starry hosts around thy throne appear, And day on day still open new delight, As in the eye of faith they shine more clear; Untill earth's shadows fade for aye away, And the glad spirit stands in cloudless day. Poem No. 536; late 1838âearly 1839 The Harvest They love me not, who at my table eat; They live not on the bread that Thou hast given; The word Thou giv'st is not their daily meat, The bread of life that cometh down from heaven; They drink but from their lips the waters dry, There is no well that gushes up within; And for the meat that perishes they cry, When Thou hast vexed their souls because of sin; Oh send thy laborers! every hill and field With the ungathered crop is whitened o'er; To those who reap it shall rich harvests yield, The full eared grain all ripened for thy store; No danger can they fear who reap with Thee, Though thick with storms the autumn sky may be. Poem No. 645; late 1838âearly 1839 The City And Thou hast placed me on a lofty hill, Where all who pass may mock and pierce me through; Oh how can I in Christ be humble still, Save that I learn with him thy will to do; I cannot now from sight of men be hid, Oh may my life thy heavenly rest proclaim; That they may see in me the works that bid The disbelievers glorify thy name; Oh make them see thy light, thy light from heaven, That they may be its children too with me; And when, through suffering here, thy peace is given, Thy nearer presence with me let them see; And hear from him who but one talent gave, That they with him shall many cities save. Poem No. 48; late 1838âearly 1839 The Rose The rose thou showst me has lost all its hue, For thou dost seem to me than it less fair; For when I look I turn from it to you, And feel the flower has been thine only care; Thou shouldst have grown as freely by its side As springs the bud from out its parent stem, But thou art from thy Father severed wide, And turnst from thine own self to look at them; Thy words do not perfume the summer air, Nor draw the eye and ear like this thy flower; No bees shall make thy lips their daily care, And sip the sweets distilled from hour to hour; Nor shall new plants from out thy scattered seed, O'er many a field the eye with beauty feed. Poem No. 554; late 1838âearly 1839 Faith There is no faith; the mountain stands within Still unrebuked, its summit reaches heaven; And every action adds its load of sin, For every action wants the little leaven; There is no prayer; it is but empty sound, That stirs with frequent breath the yielding air; With every pulse they are more strongly bound, Who make the blood of goats the voice of prayer; Oh heal them, heal them Father with thy word, Their sins cry out to Thee from every side; From son and sire, from slave and master heard, Their voices fill the desert country wide; And bid Thee hasten to relieve and save, By him who rose triumphant o'er the grave. Poem No. 620; late 1838âearly 1839 The Jew Thou art more deadly than the Jew of old, Thou hast his weapons hidden in thy speech; And though thy hand from me thou dost withhold, They pierce where sword and spear could never reach; Thou hast me fenced about with thorny talk, To pierce my soul with anguish while I hear; And while amid thy populous streets I walk, I feel at every step the entering spear; Go, cleanse thy lying mouth of all its guile, That from the will within thee ever flows; Go, cleanse the temple thou dost now defile, Then shall I cease to feel thy heavy blows; And come and tread with me the path of peace, And from thy brother's harm forever cease. Poem No. 659; late 1838âearly 1839 Spring The stem that long has borne the wintry blast, Encased with ice or powdered o'er with snow; Shall, when its chilling breath has breathed its last, Its springing leaves and bursting blossoms show; So ye, on whom the earth's cold wind has blown, While there you suffered for your master's name; The kindness of the Father soon shall own, And in the fruit you bear his love proclaim; Endure, that you the glorious light may see, That soon will rise upon the perfect soul; Press on, and you accepted soon shall be, And see the son and he shall make you whole; And on the Father's name forever call, And from his perfect wisdom never fall. Poem No. 574; late 1838âearly 1839 The Temple The temple shall be built, the Holy One, Such as the earth nor heavens have ever seen; Nor shall the work by human hands be done, But from the will of man it shall be clean; Ages on ages shall the pile be wrought, By Him whose will his children shall obey; Till every son, by his own Father taught, The chiseled stone he brought shall cast away; Slowly the ancient temple is repaired, While one by one as lively stones we grow; By every son the work is to be shared, Built on the corner stone in Christ laid low; That from the eternal shrine might ever rise, A holy prayer, a living sacrifice. Poem No. 582; late 1838âearly 1839 The White Horse The Word goes forth! I see its conquering way, O'er seas and mountains sweeps it mighty on; The tribes of men are bowing 'neath its sway, The pomp of kings, the pride of wisdom's gone; Behold, the poor have raised the victor's shout; The meek are crowned, their triumph too is nigh; The barren now no more a son can doubt; The mourner wipes her cheek and glittering eye; Hark from the lofty places comes a groan, That they cannot their wealth ill-gotten hide; The midnight darkness from the thief is flown, The garment's rent of falsely clothed pride; The veil is drawn; the judgement seat appears; I see joy mingling with a world in tears. Poem No. 597; late 1838âearly 1839 The Tent Thou springest from the ground, and may not I From Him who speeds thy branches high and wide; And from the scorching sun and stormy sky May I not too with friendly shelter hide; There is no shade like thine to shield the poor, From the hot scorching words that meet the ear; The snowy, frozen flakes they must endure, Of those whose hearts have never shed a tear; Yet He who shoots thy leafy fabric high, Shall in my verse spread wide a tempering skreen, And when oppressed with heat his sons pass by, With hastening feet they'll seek its arches green; And bless the Father who has o'er them spread A tent of verdure for their aching head. Poem No. 698; late 1838âearly 1839 My Sheep I will not look upon the lands you own, They are not those my heavenly Father gives; That with his word of truth forever sown, Blesses the man that on their bounty lives; His yoke is easy, and his burthen light; To till his grounds within his only care, With God to live, his ever new delight, And with out toil his liberal gifts to share; He wants no barns, no shelter from the cold, His Father's love provides for all he needs; One of the flock of his own master's fold, He hears his voice, and goes where'er he leads; And pleasant pasture finds where'er he goes, For all the paths of sin the Shepherd knows. Poem No. 285; late 1838âearly 1839 The Corner Stone The builders still reject my corner stone, That I low down in every soul have laid; Their houses rise and fall; for there are none That in the building seek its chosen aid; Why will ye raise upon the shifting sands Houses that every storm must battle down; Temples and altars reared to Me with hands, That rain and floods beneath their fury drown? Clear, clear the ground of all that you have brought, The corner stone shall now be laid anew; That which the foolish builders set at naught Shall now be laid where all that pass shall view; And wonder why men thought them ever wise, And on their own foundation sought to rise. Poem No. 474; late 1838âearly 1839. The Good Ground The Word must fall; but where the well-tilled ground Without a stone or briar to choke the seed; Where can the deep, black earth it needs be found, That shall the plant with plenteous juices feed? Break up your fallow lands! the seed is sown With heaven's own richness in each bosom's field, Cut down the tares that rankly there have grown, And heavy crops the word of God shall yield; Cut down your will that sows the deadly tare, That bears no fruit but for your own dark breast; Cut down, nor let a root the sharp axe spare, Then shall my land enjoy its day of rest; And he that reaps rejoice with Him who sows, While through the loaded field he daily goes. Poem No. 599; late 1838âearly 1839 The Beginning and The End Thou art the First and Last, the End of all The erring spirit seeks of earth to know; Thee first it left, a Parent at its fall, To Thee again thy sinful child must go; With awe I read the lessons of thy grace, To all that disobey so freely given; The child shall see again his Father's face, And through thy son return to Thee and heaven; Ye spirits that around your Maker stand, Rejoice! the world is ransomed from its weight of woe; Thou earth obey your sovereign's wise command, Wash, 'twas for you he bade his mercy flow; It is for you Christ's blood descends like rain, That you through him might rise to life again. Poem No. 663; late 1838âearly 1839 Nature The bubbling brook doth leap when I come by, Because my feet find measure with its call; The birds know when the friend they love is nigh, For I am known to them both great and small; The flowers, which on the lovely hill-side grow, Expect me there, when Spring their bloom has given; And many a bush and tree my wanderings know, And e'en the clouds and silent stars of heaven: For he, who with his Maker walks aright, Shall be their lord, as Adam was before; His ear shall catch each sound with new delight, Each object wear the dress that then it wore; And he, as when erect in soul he stood, Hear from his Father's lips that all is good. Poem No. 472; late 1838âearly 1839 Morning The light will never open sightless eyes, It comes to those who willingly would see; And every object, hill, and stream, and skies, Rejoice within th'encircling line to be; 'Tis dayâthe field is filled with busy hands, The shop resounds with noisy workmen's din, The traveller with his staff all ready stands His yet unmeasured journey to begin; The light breaks gently too within the breastâ Yet there no eye awaits the crimson morn, The forge and noisy anvil are at rest, Nor men nor oxen tread the fields of corn, Nor pilgrim lifts his staffâit is no day To those who find on earth a place to stay. Poem No. 522; late 1838âearly 1839 The Temptation Thou shalt not live e'en by the bread alone, But by the word from out the mouth of God; This is the bread by all his children known, All those who tread the path their Master trod; For this thou shalt leave all and follow him, The Word of God that has come down from heaven; For this thou shalt cut off the dearest limb, That by the Father has to thee been given; Houses and lands, mother's and father's love, To this are cheaper than the barren sand; This is the Life that cometh from above, To bind the heavens in one eternal band; And died that us from death he might recall, And God in us and him be all in all. Poem No. 693; late 1838âearly 1839 Help Thou wilt be near me Father, when I fail, For Thou hast called me now to be thy son; And when the foe within me may assail, Help me to say in Christ âThy will be doneâ; This ever calms, this ever gives me rest; There is no fight in which I may not stand, When Christ doth dwell supreme within my breast, And Thou upholdst me with thy mighty hand; To live a servant here on earth I ask, To be with Thee my ever great reward, To overcome all sin my strengthening task, Till with Thyself my soul made pure accord; Then shall my service be in Christ complete, And I restored in him thy Holyness shall meet. Poem No. 702; late 1838âearly 1839 Change Father! there is no change to live with Thee, Save that in Christ I grow from day to day, In each new word I hear, each thing I see My feet rejoycing hasten on the way; The morning comes with blushes overspread, And I new-wakened find a morn within; And in its modest dawn around me shed, Thou hearst the prayer and the ascending hymn; Hour follows hour, the lengthening shades descend; Yet they could never reach as far as me Did not thy love their kind protection lend, That I a child might sleep awhile on Thee; Till to the light restored by gentle sleep With new-found zeal I might thy precepts keep. Poem No. 124; late 1838âearly 1839 The Poor I walk the streets and though not meanly drest, Yet none so poor as can with me compare; For none though weary call me in to rest, And though I hunger none their substance share; I ask not for my stay the broken reed, That fails when most I want a friendly arm; I cannot on the loaves and fishes feed, That want the blessing that they may not harm; I only ask the living word to hear, From tongues that now but speak to utter death; I thirst for one cool cup of water clear, But drink the riled stream of lying breath; And wander on though in my Father land, Yet hear no welcome voice, and see no beakoning hand. Poem No. 280; late 1838âearly 1839 They Who Hunger Thou hearst the hungry ravens when they cry, And to thy children shalt Thou not send bread; Who on thy aid alone for help rely, And in the steps of Christ alone would tread? They shall not cry for righteousness in vain, But bread from heaven thy hand shall soon supply; When falls in plenteous showers the latter rain, Thy plants shall push their thrifty branches high; And untilled lands that now affront the sight To the strong plough their riches shall lay bare; And like thy fruitful fields the eye delight, Rejoycing in thy sun and shower to share, And they who mourn shall sing the harvest song, And reap the crops that to thy sons belong. Poem No. 681; late 1838âearly 1839 Who Hath Ears To Hear Let Him Hear! The sun doth not the hidden place reveal, Whence pours at morn his golden flood of light; But what the night's dark breast would fain conceal, In its true colors walks before our sight; The bird does not betray the secret springs, Whence note on note her music sweetly pours; Yet turns the ear attentive while she sings, The willing heart while falls the strain adores; So shall the spirit tell not whence its birth, But in its light thine untold deeds lay bare; And while it walks with thee flesh-clothed the earth, Its words shall of the Father's love declare: And happy those whose ears shall hail its voice, And clean within the day it gives rejoice. Poem No. 577; late 1838âearly 1839 The Sign They clamor for a sign with eyeless zeal, As if 'twould lift their burthened souls to heaven; And think the spirit must the body heal, Not know the want for which alone 'twas given; They cry; but faithless shall no sign receive, Save that of him who for the sinful died, That they might on his saving name believe, And in his promise trustingly confide; Then from the earth, where buried now they lie, On the true Sabbath morn shall they arise, And, taught by him, shall then ascend on high His glory to behold with unsealed eyes, And in his Father's presence still to live, The heir of all His perfect love can give. Poem No. 639; late 1838âearly 1839 The Tree I too will wait with thee returning spring, When thick the leaves shall cling on every bough, And birds within their new grown arbor sing, Unmindful of the storms that tore me now; For I have stripped me naked to the blast, That now in triumph through my branches rides; But soon the winter's bondage shall be past, To him who in the Savior's love abides; And as his Father to thy limbs returns, Blossoms and bloom to sprinkle o'er thy dress, So shall Christ call from out their funeral urns, Those who in patience still their souls possess; And clothe in raiments never to wax old, All whom his Father gave him for his fold. Poem No. 277; late 1838âearly 1839 The Meek I would be meek as He who bore his cross, And died on earth that I in him might live, And, while in sin I knew not of my loss, Suffered with gentle love his hope to give; May I within the manger too be laid, And mid the thieves his childlike meekness show; And though by him who kisses me betrayed, May I no will but his my Master's know; Thus sheltered by the lonely vale of tears, My feet shall tread secure the path he trod, Mid lying tongues that pierce my side like spears, I too shall find within the peace of God; And though rejected shall possess the earth, And dead in Christ be witness of his birth. Poem No. 287; late 1838âearly 1839 The Desert Oh, bid the desert blossom as the rose, For there is not one flower that meets me now; On all thy fields lie heaped the wintry snows, And the rough ice encrusts the fruitful bough; Oh, breathe upon thy ruined vineyard still, Though like the dead it long unmoved has lain; Thy breath can with the bloom of Eden fill, The lifeless clods in verdure clothe again; Awake, ye slothful! open wide the earth To the new sun and spirit's quickening rain; They come to bid the furrows heave in birth, And strew with roses thick the barren plain; Awake, be early in your untilled field, And it to you the crop of peace shall yield. Poem No. 380; late 1838âearly 1839 The Clay Thou shalt do what Thou wilt with thine own hand, Thou form'st the spirit like the moulded clay; For those who love Thee keep thy just command, And in thine image grow as they obey; New tints and forms with every hour they take, Whose life is fashioned by thy spirit's power; The crimson dawn is round them when they wake, And golden triumphs wait the evening hour; The queenly-sceptred night their souls receive, And spreads their pillows 'neath her sable tent; And o'er their slumbers unseen angels breathe, The rest Thou hast to all who labor lent; That they may rise refreshed to light again, And with Thee gather in the whitening grain. Poem No. 692; late 1838âearly 1839 The Altar Oh kindle up thine altar! see the brands Lie scattered here and there that lit the pile; Thy priests to other service turn their hands, And with unhallowed works their souls defile; No victims bleed, no fire is blazing high, They leave thy shrine to serve another god; Who will not hear them when to him they cry, But be to them thine own avenging rod; The people wait in vain to hear thy voice, With none to lead them right, with none to feed; No more within thy courts their hearts rejoice, But at each word the Christ must in them bleed; Oh kindle up the heart's expiring flame! Come quickly Lord, and magnify thy name. Poem No. 385; late 1838âearly 1839 Praise Oh praise the Lord! let every heart be glad! The day has come when He will be our God; No fears can come to make his children sad, His joy is theirs who in his ways have trod; Oh praise ye hills! praise Him ye rivers wide! Ye people own his love! revere his power! He makes his peace in one full current glide, It shall flow on unbroken from this hour; Shout! shout ye saints! the triumph day is near, The King goes forth Himself his sons to save; The habitations of the poor to rear, And bid the palm and myrtle round them wave; Open your gates ye heaven uplifted walls! The King of Kings for entrance at them calls. Poem No. 386; winter-spring 1839 Terror There is no safety; fear has seized the proud; The swift run to and fro but cannot fly; Within the streets I hear no voices loud, They pass along with low, continuous cry; Lament! bring forth the mourning garments now, Prepare a solemn fast! for ye must mourn; Strip every leaf from off the boastful bough, Let every robe from hidden deeds be torn; Bewail! bewail! great Babylon must fall! Her sins have reached to heaven; her doom is sealed; Upon the Father now of mercies call, For the great day of secrets is revealed! Repent! why do ye still uncertain stand, The kingdom of my son is nigh at hand! Poem No. 625; winter-spring 1839 The Prayer Father! help them who walk in their own light; Who think they see, but are before Thee blind; Give them within thy rest, thy spirit's sight; And may they in the Christ their healing find; Father! they have not faith, help Thou their trust; Grant them within thy precepts to fulfill; Oh bid thy spirit animate their dust, And bid them once again to know thy will; Then shall they live with Thee and sin no more; Then walk with Christ thy well beloved son; And when their earthly pilgrimage is o'er, And they the martyr's crown in him have won, Oh take them to thine own eternal rest, The heaven where he who enters must be blest. Poem No. 119â123; winter-spring 1839 Humility Oh humble me! I cannot bide the joy That in my Savior's presence ever flows; May I be lowly, lest it may destroy The peace his childlike spirit ever knows; I would not speak thy word, but by Thee stand; While Thou dost to thine erring children speak; Oh help me but to keep his own command, And in my strength to feel me ever weak; Then in thy presence shall I humbly stay, Nor lose the life of love he came to give; And find at last the life, the truth, the way, To where with him thy blessed servants live; And walk forever in the path of truth, A servant yet a son, a sire and yet a youth. Poem No. 384; winter-spring 1839 Forgiveness Forgive me Father! for to Thee I stand Alike with those who have not known thy law; Oh humble me beneath thy mighty hand, That I from Christ may every lesson draw; Thou knowst me needy, naked, blind and poor; Oh help me to buy gold refined by Thee, May I of Thee the marriage robe procure, Anoint my eyes that I indeed may see; May I before thy presence ever kneel, A suppliant waiting on thy gracious love, That every want before I ask can feel, And from distress will hasten to remove; And to my master's joy will me restore, Where I no want can feel forevermore. Poem No. 136; winter-spring 1839 The Heavenly Rest They do not toil in heaven; they live and love, Their heavenly Father every want supplies; Nor can they from their blest abode remove, For nought can enter there, that ever dies. A life of love! how sweetly pass its hours, No tear, but that of joy, can touch the cheeks; Their lips distill, like fragrance-breathing flowers, The truth which each to each forever speaks. Oh, blessed the Parent, who has bid us know The joys, which at His own right hand doth dwell; Oh, blessed the children, that His praises show, And of His love in ceaseless worship tell; And blessed the Lamb, that for their sins was slain, That they with Him forevermore might reign. Poem No. 640; winter-spring 1839 Compassion He saw them tasked with heavy burthens all, Bowed down and weary 'neath the heavy load; With none their faltering footsteps home to call, Or point them out the strait and narrow road; His spirit bore their burthens as his own, He healed the sick, restored the sightless eyes; He heard the mourner for a loved one moan, And bid the dead from out the grave arise; In him the spirit ever rests secure, For there is one to ease its struggling grief; Oh seek the rest that ever shall endure, And you shall find in him the true relief; And join with him to succor the distrest, And be like him forever by them blest. Poem No. 167; winter-spring 1839 The Rock Thou art; there is no stay but in Thy love; Thy strength remains; it built the eternal hills; It speaks the word forever heard above, And all creation with its presence fills; Upon it let me stand and I shall live; Thy strength shall fasten me forever fixed, And to my soul its sure foundations give, When earth and sky thy word in one has mixed; Rooted in Thee no storm my branch shall tear, But with each day new sap shall upward flow, And for thy vine the clustering fruit shall bear; That with each rain the lengthening shoots may grow, Till o'er Thy Rock its leaves spread far and wide, And in its green embrace its Parent hide. Poem No. 664; winter-spring 1839 To notice other days were pages given To notice other days were pages given, That when by former scenes anew we stray, The leaves of our own growth let fall from heaven May play in Memory's breath acrost our way. So these gathered, though strown; by friendly hand, Meet me again as by his door I rove; Not scattered vainly on his well-tilled land, So that in Memory's breath they ever move. Poem No. 739a; winterâspring 1839? The Crocus The earliest flower of Spring, Thou hast it; it is thine; The first upon thine unstirred soil, To give it thee is mine; It chose a mild, fair April morn Its yellow form to show, When the leaves and grass grew green As thou wast here to know. And its sight had a look like thee, Of the early morn and spring; And I've taken it from thy garden bank, 'Twas left for me to bring. And upon thy desk it is placed, With the water at its root; That the voice of the spring and early morn May speak though ever mute. Poem No. 490a; winter-spring 1839? The Plant Thou art my Father Thou dost give me birth Pleasant thy smile &amp; pleasant e'en thy frown Thy hand here placed me in the furrowed earth And sent the rain in plenteous fulness down Twas Thou who watched when on the spring grain The small dew fell and sunlight daily poured And when the wind blew fiercely from the main Thy care each drooping limb has oft restored Thou art my Father still thy care attend Support the plant the seed and lofty tree Alike look up to find in Thee their friend The ear the spring blade draw life from Thee And Thou the humble fruit I daily yield Wilt come and view with pleasure in thy field Poem No. 659a; winter-spring 1839? I am the Way Thy way is simple for I am the light By which thou travelest on to meet thy God Brighter and brighter still shall be thy sight Till thou hast ended here the path I trod Before thee stretches far the thorny way Yet smoothed for thee by him who went before Go on it leads you to the perfect day The rest I to the patriarch Abraham swore Go on and I will guide you safely through For I have walked with suffering feet thy path Confide in me the Faithful and the True And thou shalt flee the approaching day of wrath Whose dawn e'en now the horizon's border shows And with its kindling fires prophetic glows. Poem No. 591; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Kingdom of God Is within you My kingdom is within you seek it there Ye shall not seek in vain who work within You shall within it find the good and fair The living spirits freed from death and sin Thou canst not buy with gold and silver ore The treasures that my kingdom can afford They are for those who love me kept in store And they who love me keep my holy word Repent be quick to do what first thou did There is but one the strait and narrow way Fear not when thou art faint and must be chid But only fear lest thou from me should stray For I am life and they who seek me find The keys of heaven I hold to loose and bind. Poem No. 341; fall 1838âsummer 1839 My Church This is the rock where I my church will build Harder than flint its sure foundations are Though few now pass the door it shall be filled The gates of hell shall not my triumph bar Seek and thou too the door shall find Knock and thou too shall enter in I hold the keys and who but me can bind? And who but me can loose the bonds of sin? Eternal life shall those who worship here Forevermore receive at my right hand I call thee too my wedding day is near Haste lest without the bridal hall you stand And you be found not with the garment on Which all who live with me on earth have worn. Poem No. 655; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Charge I speak in you the word that gave you birth Fear not I call you to attend my voice Walk humbly on thy path lies through the earth But thou shalt in the latter day rejoice If thou to all hast spoken ever true What thou hast heard from me who send you forth For every secret thing is brought to view When I before all men proclaim your worth Speak boldly then for 'tis not you they hear But him who in you speaks the living word Nor those who kill the body need you fear They cannot hear who have not of me heard My sheep shall hear thee for I bid thee call And hasten at thy summons one and all. Poem No. 274; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Sabbath Thy rest has come thy long expected rest The spirit sees at last her Maker God Within His presence ever to be blest Nor longer feel for sin His chastening rod The sabbath has begun its sacred hours No more can aught of earthly passions stir The service of thy shrine demands my powers And earth no longer can its claim defer Oh when shall all its service be complete And I have done thy perfect will on earth That Christ my name before Thee may repeat And wake me as a witness of his birth? When shall I wake and know that day of love That endless Sabbath kept for me above? Poem No. 715; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Invitation There is no sound but thou dost hear my voice And in the silence of thine heart obey Thou shalt with me before the throne rejoice When I have led thee in the living way Follow my steps they lead to God and life Where thou no more shalt fear no more shall fall For I will give the weary rest from strife And they with me shall dwell who hear my call Come then partake the feast for you prepared I have come down to bid you welcome there For those who have with me the dangers shared I will with them my Father's blessings share Come hasten on thy brothers wait within Strive for in me thou shalt be free from sin.

I will give you rest The rest for all my Father's love prepares Come and in me and him be wholly blest And I will free you from the world of cares For I am meek and lowly learn of me And you shall find in me the promised peace Come learn of me though blind your eyes shall see And every joy I give shall never cease The marriage feast is ready hasten in For those who tarry shall their lateness mourn Come and your robes I'll wash from every sin And in my arms shall every son be borne Till freed from every danger he shall be A child of light and all my glory see.

Poem No. 528; fall 1838âsummer 1839 Blessed are they that mourn Blessed are they that mourn my life is theirs The life I led on earth they too shall lead Its joy and sorrows and its weight of cares Shall all be theirs for in my name they bleed Happy their lot for so I bid them grow And finish here the work my Father gave And when the weary day its end shall know They shall through me rejoice them o'er the grave Happy their death for they shall live again When I in triumph come to claim the few Who in my name the cross within have worn And by their toils have found me just and true Happy thrice happy those who seek my face They shall not want for they shall find my grace.

Poem No. 61; fall 1838âsummer 1839 'Tis Finished Tis done the world has vanished Christ remains The only sure the only lasting trust Look see its smouldering fire the iron chains Are broke that bound my spirit to the dust A life of love henceforth my sole employ The Father's love in him so freely shown Come hasten on and share with me the joy That only from the cross by blood has flown The joy I share to all is freely given Who live the life he led on earth before Come and e'en here thou hast the bliss of heaven The robe put on the wedding robe he wore And thou shalt be accepted at his feast Nor fail of much he loveth e'en the least. Poem No. 724; fall 1838âsummer 1839 Effort I have not loved thee much my heart is poor And cannot give like that thou givest me Oh would with stronger zeal it might endure And all thy gift in all thy suffering see Lift up the feeble hands the bending head Come rouse press on the goal is yet before I will with stronger feet thy pathway tread And reach while still I may the open door That thou hast set for me and all who fight The war with sin thou givest them to wage Oh help me lest upon me fall the night And I without shall feel the tempest rage That now is rising in the lowering east Oh quicken thou my steps to taste thy feast. Poem No. 236; fall 1838âsummer 1839 To the pure all things are pure The flowers I pass have eyes that look at me The birds have ears that hear my spirit's voice And I am glad the leaping brook to see Because it does at my light step rejoice Come brothers all who tread the grassy hill Or wander thoughtless o'er the blooming fields Come learn in sweet obedience of thy will And every sight and sound new pleasure yields Nature shall seem another house of thine Where He who formed thee bid live and play And in thy rambles e'en the creeping vine Shall keep with thee a jocund holyday And every plant and bird and insect be Thine own companions born for harmony. Poem No. 498; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Task Thy cross is hard to bear it weighs me down E'en to the earth where on my feet must tread Yet I by this must gain the wished for crown And find the spirit in the body dead Hard is the lesson patience gives to learn Yet when tis past sweet comfort 'twill bestow And thou wilt cheer me for I cannot turn But must in thee to manly stature grow Oh lift me up with every passing hour Some higher and still higher sight to gain Till I am raised above temptation's power And find in thee relief from every pain For thou wilt give to those who ask aright To taste thy cup and portion of delight. Poem No. 711; fall 1838âsummer 1839 Spring I have not lived the flesh has hedged me in I have not known the joy to be with thee But I must strive to loose the bonds of sin That press me round and be forever free Give me the victory o'er the tyrant death Whose scepter rests now cold upon my heart Breathe on me and reviving at thy breath The chills that o'er me steal will quick depart And I revive like the ice frosted flower That winter seizes in his rude embrace When spring with kindly sun and loosing shower Creeps on from southern climes with welcome face And chides the spoilers of her children fair And once again restores them to her care.

Ye hills retire! open thou raging sea My steps are onward now; ye cannot stay The God of battlesâlo He fights for me Submit before His feet prepare the way Ye iron breasted armies too I scorn Away how feeble is the spear or sword I am of Him who gives the quicking spirit born And wield forever wield the conquering word Its power shall beat in atoms mountain high And through the parting sea shall lead me dry. Poem No. 802; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Acorn The seed has started, who can stay it? see The leaves are sprouting high above the ground Already o'er the flowers its head, the tree That rose beside it and that on it frowned Behold is but a small bush by its side Still on! it cannot stop; its branches spread; It looks o'er all the earth in giant pride The nations find upon its limbs their bread Its boughs their millions shelter from the heat Beneath its shade see kindreds tongues and all That the wide world contains they all retreat Beneath the shelter of that acorn small That late thou flung away 'twas the best gift That heaven e'er gave, its head the low shall lift.

Poem No. 621; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Harvest The plant it springs it rears its drooping head Strengthened with every shower that falls from heaven See quickly at their touch its branches spread And soon twill bless with flowers look they are given The promised blessing cannot be delayed But fast will follow every good intent Tis not in vain thy mourning spirit prayed Behold the rich reward in answer sent Peace from the Father joy a full increase For all thou sowed in sorrow in the earth Thy joy shall bud and bloom thy new found peace Grow with each day.

Poem No. 345; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Promise I come the rushing wind that shook the place Where those once sat who spake with tongues of fire O'er thee to shed the freely given grace And bid them speak while I thy verse inspire The world shall hear and know that thou art sent To preach glad tidings to the needy poor And witness that by me the power is lent That wakes the dead, the halt and lame can cure Thy words shall breathe refreshment to the mind That long has borne the heavy yoke of pain For thou art to the will of Him who lives resigned And from thy sorrows reap the promised gain And gather fruits with Him who with thee sows Nor can men steal thy goods, for none thy treasure knows Poem No. 225; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Path of Peace Turn ye turn ye who tread the wandring path That leads not to my rest thorn-sprinkled o'er Why treasure wrath against the day of wrath And garments buy for burning kept in store Oh come and I will comfort you indeed With peace no earthly hand can give your soul Come buy of me against the time of need Drink drink the wine from out my flowing bowl Ye shall not want. Your feet shall find again The flowery path they lost in younger days When every hour but added to your gain Of pleasant fields and birds' inviting lays And you were led from hill to streamlet on Nor knew the day was ended till twas gone.

Poem No. 344; fall 1838âsummer 1839 Grief I bid thee weep but mourn not at thy lot As though no comfort flowed for those who mourn Thou shalt not sorrow always tears are not But that by them thou mayst from sin be torn Thou canst not weep for when my feet have traced On to the goal whence I first came thy God There every tear from memory effaced Thou'lt smile and own as his the chastening rod What son is he the Father does not strive By sorrow's porch to bring to me within The plants his hand have raised have learned to thrive Through much affliction borne to them within Be wise and He will lead you by the hand Till you through tears shall see the promised land Poem No. 215; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Reward To him who hath to him I love to give And he each day shall more and more abound He shall the hidden manna eat and live That only is in true obedience found Come and its stores I'll open to your sight They lie concealed save I the treasure show None find my gold save those restored to light Where nought of sin the spotless soul can know There thou shalt live and feast with me in joy A guest mid many that have owned my name Arise henceforth thine ever blest employ The praises of the Lamb thy lips shall claim No more to feed on that which is not bread No more to mourn and perish with the dead. Poem No. 738; fall 1838âsummer 1839 So is every one who is born of the spirit It bloweth where it listeth hark the sound Ye know not whence it comes nor where it goes Its fruit shall in your borders to be found Yet know ye not the stalk from which it grows Go learn whence comes these words of heavenly truth Cleanse ye the fountain whence their murmurs flow And you though old shall still renew your youth And of the life the spirit leads shall know Go count the steps that measure out the path That leads through John for he must come before Then shall you flee the approaching day of wrath And enter safely through the accepted door For I am sure who promise seek my rest The star the east beheld shines sinking in the west. Poem No. 304; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Seed Wouldst thou behold my features cleanse thy heart Wash out the stains thy will impresses there And as the clay-stamped images depart Thou shalt behold my face how wondrous fair How changed from that thine outward eye must see It wears no form its searching glance can know From flesh and blood it now has wrought it free And in the spirit learns from Christ to grow That which thou sowest is not that which springs From the dead grain thou givest to the earth Each moment's toil an added lustre brings To deck the spirit when it springs to birth From out the seed in Christ that long has lain Buried beneath the snowy-crusted plain. Poem No. 853; fall 1838âsummer 1839 I am the Light of the World I am the sun thine eye has seen the light That lighteneth every man in spirit born I can restore the blind to perfect sight I am of heaven the crimson breaking morn Gird on thy strength thy march will need it all And many round thee hurrying to and fro Shall stand to hear thy word's prophetic call The day the day is near proclaim aloud The day of wrath or joy to all the earth Behold Ë the ascending cloud (though small appears) 'Tis a sure witness of my second birth I come and every eye their Lord shall see And those who scorn and pierce shall bow the knee. Poem No. 208; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Apostle I am the First and Last declare my Word For I have sent thee an apostle forth Thou hast from Me the living gospel heard Thou shalt proclaim its truth from south to north The farthest west the early east shall hear My name that by the earth shall hallowed be And they shall bow before my shrine in fear And own my truth and it shall make them free And thou if thou shalt keep my holy name A priest shall be before the living God And through the world the Father's truth proclaim Ruling the nations with his chastening rod And walk from glory on to glory still Till thou in me has done his perfect will. Poem No. 207; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Message There is no voice but it is born of Me I am there is no other God beside Before Me all that live shall bow the knee And be as in a fiery furnace tried Warn them for I have told thee of my love Bid them prepare my supper to attend Thou has heard him who cometh from above Let them receive thee for I am your friend Though they have scorned the servants that I sent Year after year within each stubborn breast Let them give back the vineyard I have lent Them yet another year to find my rest And sent my son let them thy word receive And in The Christ that in thee speaks believe. Poem No. 628; fall 1838âsummer 1839 I Am the Bread of Life I am thy life thou shalt upon me feed And daily eat my flesh and drink my blood For nothing else than me canst thou have need Thou art a spirit I the spirit's food Come eat and thou shalt ask for bread no more Come drink and thou shalt never thirsting cry again I shall be in thee an increasing store A spring forever swollen by the rain Drink freely thou hast found the stream of life In deeps where few have sought its healing wave Thou hast fought well with sin the mortal strife And hath found him who hath the power to save Abide in me and I will lead you on Till you the Father's home in me have won. Poem No. 209; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Foe There is no pause, the day rolls swiftly on; Hour adds to hour its distance Lord! from Thee; And soon the light Thou givest will be gone, And night be here, and none thy coming see; O bid them wake! sound ye the trumpets! sound! The foe is on you! haste, he's at the door! Soon, soon thy limbs will be securely bound, And you in chains your former sloth deplore; Wake! wake! there is no time to lose in sleep; Break from the will that binds you still in sin, A faithful watch o'er every action keep; And know the foe that spoils thee is within; Go back, retrace the steps your feet have trod, That you may find protection in your God. Poem No. 624; fall 1838âsummer 1839 Yet Once More The heavens are shaken! not the solid earth But the high heavens, the spirit's own abode; Through the dark souls whence sin springs armed to birth, The miracle of miracles is showed! There mountains shake, there breaks a startling voice Unknown amid its sinful depths before; The guilty dare not, when it speaks, rejoice; But fain within its presence would adore; Fly! fly! it is the spirit's voice you hear, It is an angel sent to thee from heaven, To tell thee that the marriage feast is near, And but a moment's warning can be given; Oh haste! the robe, the robe of white put on, E'er that for thee that moment shall be gone. Poem No. 508; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Humble Thou dost exalt the humble; they shall be Of thine own sons, and Thou shalt bless their lot; And make them kings and priests to live with Thee, Though they before had dwelt in poorest cot; Over its roof Thou watched with tender care, While they no fear in early childhood knew; And didst with ready hand each meal prepare, While they to manlier stature daily grew; And ever on their steps thine angels wait, And ever near remain to hear their call; Though with the lowly vine they grew of late, Thou shalt exalt them like the cedars tall, That on thy holy mountain lift their heads Forever wet with dews thy mercy sheds. Poem No. 670; fall 1838âsummer 1839 Comfort Thou gladst my heart but not with oil and wine, But that Thou dost forgive me when I sin; And in thy son would make me wholly thine, That I may find his peace and love within; Still may I more and more find peace with Thee, Who hath from infancy my footsteps led; Till, by his love, from sin and death made free My feet at length thy heavenly courts shall tread; Where he a mansion has for me prepared, With those who trod his thorny path before, Who have with him thy house already shared, And at his feast the marriage garment wore; Oh may I see them when my work is done, Like them a faithful servant of thy son. Poem No. 676; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Guest I knock, but knock in vain; there is no call Comes from within to bid me enter there; The selfish owner sits within his hall, And will not open, will not hear my prayer; Blessed is the man that doth my call attend, And rise with anxious haste to see his guest; For I to all that hear me am a friend, And where I enter in that house is blest; Oh hasten then each mansion to prepare For him who blesses all that hear his word, He shall with them his Father's mansion share; Eye hath not seen, nor mortal ear hath heard That which the heart that loves the Lord shall see, When they within the veil with him shall be. Poem No. 240; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Eagles The eagles gather on the place of death So thick the ground is spotted with their wings, The air is tainted with the noisome breath The wind from off the field of slaughter brings; Alas! no mourners weep them for the slain, But all unburied lies the naked soul; The whitening bones of thousands strew the plain, Yet none can now the pestilence controul; The eagles gathering on the carcase feed, In every heart behold their half-formed prey; The battened wills beneath their talons bleed, Their iron beaks without remorse must slay; Till by the sun no more the place is seen, Where they who worshipped idol gods have been. Poem No. 490; fall 1838âsummer 1839 Then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn The day, the day, 'tis changed to darkest night! There is no beauty in its morning beams, But men run to and fro within its light As haunted by the thought of horrid dreams; They do not speak of what they spoke before, Nor greet each other now with wonted smile; Their hearts are pricked within them to the core, Nor can the sight of aught their pain beguile; Within their homes they hush the notes of joy, For like a snare their sorrow has come on; The slightest burthens now their souls annoy, And in an instant all their mirth is gone; For he who long has tarried is at hand, And comes Himself his vineyard to demand. Poem No. 486; fall 1838âsummer 1839 Repent for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand Repent, repent, the day of wrath is near! Who shall abide the terror of the hour? Repent, the sun of righteousness is here, Thou hast no stay save in his rock-built tower; The rains descend, the tempest speeds its way; They pour upon the houses built with hands, That melt before the torrents; walls of clay Dissolved roll onward with the rolling sands; Where is the house that stood before secure With gates and mighty bulwarks lifted high? It stood not on the strong foundation sure That rain and tempest's shock can still defy, And, when the storm around has ceased to roar, Stand still unmoved where once it stood before. Poem No. 408; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Name The rightful name that thou art called by, By him who knows thee as thou shouldst be known; Hast thou e'er learnt it? if not, with me try, I seek my own and would not be alone; Though often called, yet I have heard it not, By better name than men can give to me; For I the one so called have long forgot, As seen within a glass, yet knew 'twas he; Come, let us seek ourselves, that they when found May be at home to him who knocks without; And to our names respond with joyful sound, Nor longer wander here unknown about, As those whom none know where their lodgings are, But sleep in barns or in the open air. Poem No. 551; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Mourner How blessed the tears of him who still weeps on, When he has ceased to feel affliction's rod; Forgetful that from him the chastening's gone; His eye beholds in faith his Father, God! Thy tears are pearls for which the world shall pay; More precious they than India's valued gold, Go on in humble mind thy kingly way, Though oft shall scorch the sun and chill the cold; Faint not; though travellers few shall bid thee cheer, Thou know'st the road thy well tried feet have found; And soon, be thou but strong, shalt thou draw near The band that death's strong ties to thee have bound; And ever onward journey thence with them, And him who leads, the Prince of Bethlehem. Poem No. 178; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Giants The giants, they who walked the earth of old Are come again to scourge this feeble race; And weapons long forgot in pride they hold, To dash to earth your idols in disgrace; Their armor proof shall be 'gainst sword or spear, Your strength now lifts to smite a feebler foe; Your cries for help their ears can never hear, Nor wounded can their eyes your sufferings know; Arise! gird on the might that now you waste On harlots, and in feasting night and day; Their coming-on shall be with eagles' haste, As from the heights they dart upon their prey; That all-unknowing pass their eyries by, With idle pace and earthward turning eye. Poem No. 503; fall 1838âsummer 1839 To the Fishermen Be mending still your nets, and cast not in While yet they are not strong to hold them all; For you yourselves will lose some joint or fin, When one shall draw than you a larger haul; 'Tis not for you as yet to venture far, Thus young upon the shifting shoreless deep; But guide thee by the highest risen star, And still thy boat within its cove thou'lt keep; Behold the wrecks that line the rocky shore, Of hulks more stout than thine to meet the wave; And hear afar the storm's low-muttered roar, And learn from me thy feebler bark to save; Who will not tempt in pride time's wind-tost sea, Till manned with choicest men my ship shall be. Poem No. 60; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Sower To want is there to be where I am not, Abundance waits for me where'er I tread; The cares of life in me are all forgot, I have enough and e'en to spare of bread; Come, taste, and hunger shall be laid at rest; And thirst once quenched shall never thirst again; Thou shalt of all I have be long possest, And long thy life my body shall sustain; There are who food will give thee, but 'tis theirs; And hunger rages but the more 'tis fed; 'Twas made from out the grains of scattered tares, That through my field by wicked hands were spread, But thou shalt have the wheat that's sown by me, And in thy bosom's field new harvests ever see. Poem No. 742; fall 1838âsummer 1839 Charity Whate'er thou wouldst receive at others' hands, Thou first to them must freely give away; Whether of houses high or spreading lands, Nought shall be thine till thou hast seen this day; God gives thee all; but canst thou all receive, When e'en my little thou dost yet refuse? No longer then thy brother's spirit grieve, And thou shalt have yet larger gifts to use; For in my Father's house do many live, Who, older far, in love have stronger grown, And how to them can'st thou e'er learn to give, Who all The Father hath can call their own? Give freely then, for all thou givst away Shall men with added gifts to thee repay. Poem No. 783; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Created There is nought for thee by thy haste to gain; 'Tis not the swift with Me that win the race; Through long endurance of delaying pain, Thine opened eye shall see thy Father's face; Nor here nor there, where now thy feet would turn, Thou wilt find Him who ever seeks for thee; But let obedience quench desires that burn, And where thou art, thy Father too will be! Behold! as day by day the spirit grows, Thou see'st by inward light things hid before; Till what God is, thyself, his image, shows; And thou dost wear the robe that first thou wore, When bright with radiance from his forming hand, He saw thee Lord of all his creatures stand. Poem No. 631; fall 1838âsummer 1839 To All Thou know'st not e'er the way to turn or go, For He whom man would follow turneth not; Enough for thee that thou thy Lord mayst know, And canst not for a moment be forgot; His way is hidden that thine eye may seek, And in the seeking thou thyself may find; His voice unheard that thou may'st learn to speak, His eye unseen to show thee thou art blind; Then haste thee on, his hidden path explore; And purge thine ear that thou mayst hear his voice; Unseal thine eye to him who walks before, And that thou hast a friend unseen in me rejoice; And follow on though now thy feet may tread, Where clouds still hang above the unnumbered dead. Poem No. 682; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Unrevealed Hast thou stolen aught from hunger, or in thirst Withheld the water-cup from thy parched lips, That thou mightest speak the blessed words of hope And joy; thou shalt not lack reward. Loosened Thy tongue shall with sweet-flowing sounds surprize The ear of sense; another than thyself Will be seen within to have come, and bringing Music tones from other spheres to have made Thee ever the harp of hidden minstrelsy. Forms Of heaven as seen descending on the eye Shall strike, giving to that men cannot see A place and name amongst earth's dying sons. Poem No. 159; fall 1838âsummer 1839 Sayings The world looks not the wider for thy travel, But stand thou still, and look around; as far From pole to pole, from east to west it lies, Stretching with varied rise and fall, as when With wearied feet thou has found out the utmost Bound of sea and sky. Be wise; travel with The bright clouds above thee, they are journeying, Journey too; grow there green trees beside thee As thou walkest, grow with them; finding one Common Father on thy way, nor hope an earth Made wider by thy search, nor things more bright And fair than such as ever like angels Watch around the steps of one, who in God's Path begins and ends the journey of each day. Poem No. 607; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Prisoner All men around me running to and fro Are finding life in what to me is death; I have no limbs that where I please will go, Nor voice that when I wish will find a breath; Here, where I stand, my feet take fixed root; This way or that I cannot even move; A prisoner, ever bound both hand and foot, While I a slave to mine own choice would prove; 'Tis hard to wait, but grant me thus set free; And they; how narrow their short bounded lot! My sun the centre of their worlds will be, In systems moving where they shine forgot; Their rays too feebly twinkling through the night, Where I shall shine with all day's lustre bright. Poem No. 32; fall 1838âsummer 1839 Eternal Life My life as yet is but an infant's walk, With tottering steps and words half-uttered slow; But I shall soon in nobler accents talk, And grown to manlier stature, firmer go; I shall go out and in and pasture find In him who leads me safe forever on; The spirit's fetters then shall I unbind, And sin from me forever shall be gone; Eternal life will be the gift bestowed, By him who loved us while yet dead in sin; Such love forever from the Father flowed, But we were not prepared the crown to win; Oh bless his name, who calls us on to heaven; And him in whom the promises are given. Poem No. 342; fall 1838âsummer 1839 Unto you is born a Saviour Rejoice a child is born a son is given By Him who giveth all things to the earth Sing loud ye saints that fill the courts of heaven Proclaim with welcome sound the infant's birth The star the wise men saw has led him on Unto the spot where now the babe is lain Rejoice the darkness from his sight has flown For he the serpent through the Lamb has slain He shall not hunger more rejoice ye stars Nor thirst for he the living brook has found He comes to break of sin the prison bars And scatter joy and hope his path around He comes to give the world his promised peace With joys unknown, that nevermore shall cease. Poem No. 405; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Redeemed I bear the prints of my ascended Lord, Ye cannot part me now, for I am pure; And hear, forever hear his holy word, And shall forever in the Truth endure; Behold the love the Father hath for me, That He should call his son a child of earth; And from the guilt of sin forever free, And bid me know in Him a purer birth; Come, worship with me on the holy hill, Come, be a brother with a brother's love; He will our hearts with deeper rapture fill, And we though here shall taste his joy above; And in our midst, though here, our Lord shall be, And we, while here on earth, his face shall see. Poem No. 214; fall 1838âsummer 1839 Hallowed be thy Name Thy name be hallowed, e'en thy Holy name, That dwells forever on thy children's tongue; On earth may all thy saints its praise proclaim, As in thy heavens Thou art forever sung; Thou art forever worthy! Thou art king! The Great, All Holy, ever righteous Lord! Let all thy children praise and homage bring, And in their song let every note accord; Praise Him! for He is great, his praise prolong On every harp ye strike around his throne; Join every living voice! come join the song, What praise can all your Father's goodness own; Come, throw your crowns and garlands at his feet, And his new name let every tongue repeat. Poem No. 714; fall 1838âsummer 1839 To him who overcometh To him who overcometh I will give The starry crown, the heavenly-sounding lyre; Within my Father's presence he shall live, His love shall overflow thy soul's desire; Come, strip thee of the garments thou hast worn, While on the earth thou wrought for Him in me; Take off thy raiments, they are soiled and torn, Behold, the wedding robe prepared for thee; Come, put it on; thy brothers ready wait, And ask why tarry still thy feet without; Thou shalt be with them, though thou comest late; Hark! hear, within they raise the welcome shout, To hail thee brother born, a son like them, In mine own Vine a new and fruitful stem. Poem No. 739; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Children I saw, strange sight! the children sat at meat, When they their Parent's face had never known; Nor rose they when they heard his step to greet, But feasted there upon his gifts alone; 'Twas morn, and noon, and evening hour the same; They heeded not 'twas He who gave them bread; For they had not yet learned to call his name, They had been children, but they now were dead; Yet still their Father, with a father's care, Early and late stood waiting by their board; Hoping each hour that they his love would share, And at his table sit to life restored; Alas! for many a day and year I stood And saw them feasting thus yet knew not Him how good. Poem No. 261; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The New Man The hands must touch and handle many things, The eyes long waste their glances all in vain; The feet course still in idle, mazy rings, E'er man himself, the lost, shall back regain; The hand that ever moves, the eyes that see, While day holds out his shining lamp on high, And strait as flies the honey-seeking bee, Direct the feet to unseen flowers they spy, These, when they come, the man revealed from heaven, Shall labor all the day in quiet rest, And find at eve the covert duly given, Where with the bird they find sweet sleep and rest; That shall their wasted strength to health restore, And bid them seek the morn the hills and fields once more. Poem No. 506; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Veil of the Temple 'Tis rent, the veil that parts the spirit world; Behold the temple of the Living God! The Foe who tempted once to earth is hurled, By him who wields on earth the iron rod; Rejoice, the peace he gave on earth begins! Hark, from the lowly vale the strains arise, Rejoice, the Savior comes he frees from sins! The dumb man speaks, he touches sightless eyes And Lo the scales fall off, the spirit sees Within the veil the mysteries of the dead; Bow down ye mighty! bow the stubborn knees! 'Tis on the borders of that land ye tread, Where you must see the earth's ascended king, Before whose presence bows each living thing. Poem No. 732; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Holy of Holies I cannot show thee that for which I live, Nor mortal eye hath seen, nor ear hath heard That which the Christ to those who live will give, In the rich presence of the Living Word; Go, cleanse thy soul, blot out the secret sin, Put off thy shoes for this is holy ground; And thou shalt see the kingdom come within, And in its holy precincts too be found; Awake, thou hast long filled the holy place With idols that thy heart has lifted high, From My pure temple every daemon chase, Then to thy spirit will My soul draw nigh; And thou shalt be my son, and I thy God To lead thee in the way thy Master trod. Poem No. 222; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Brethren For we are all His offspring, why deny The hand of love He bade thee to me give? Why turn from me, who in the spirit cry, That thou wouldst share thy Father's love and live? Let not between us rise the mountain chain, That with its icy cliffs divides the earth; For we are brothers, let us so remain; Alike the offspring of a heavenly birth; Invite me to thy feast, a richer board Than for thee of the Father I prepare; Thou wilt not in thy breast his treasure hoard, But send for those who may thy supper share; If thou hast tasted that the Lord is good, Thou wilt not hold from me my daily food. Poem No. 133; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Prodigal Where hast thou been my brother? thou art torn, But scarce the rags conceal thy naked soul; Thou art from desert still to desert borne, Nor yet has learned love's yielding, soft controul; Come, let me o'er thee cast this garment white, Strip off the filthy rags the world has given; The son has sent me, that I may invite The weary to his marriage feast in heaven; Oh come, for there is all thou want'st prepared, The flowing bowl that cannot ever dry, The bread of life with him who died is shared; Oh come, thou wilt not my request deny, And wander on in thorny paths to bleed, And on the husks thou feedest ever feed. Poem No. 804; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Fig Tree Thou wilt not give me aught though I am poor, And ask with shivering limbs and hungry cry; And thinkst that I the winter can endure, And thou dost not my spirit's wants deny; But thou art poor; for thou hast nought to give Of that which is both meat and drink to me; Thou bidst me on the husks thou feedest live, And with the rags thou wear'st in comfort be; The figs my Father bade me on thee seek, I taste not from thy thorns and brambles high; He made thee strong, I find thee poor and weak; He made thee rich, yet thou must of me buy; Who am but blind, and yet to thee can see; A servant still, and yet to thee am free. Poem No. 704; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Branch Thou bidst me change with every changing hour, A new formed gift to bless the hungry poor; For Thou through Christ has blest me with the power To bear the fruits that shall for them endure; In him may I grow stronger day by day, A vigorous branch abiding in thy vine; That men may pluck thereof and eating say, âThese grapes, O Father, these are wholly thineâ Then shall the clusters Thou dost love to see, With every season changing face the sun; And men rejoice beneath my shade to be, When day with all the toils it brings is done; And I in Christ shall be forever blest, To give them at its close thy holy rest. Poem No. 665; fall 1838âsummer 1839 Not as the World giveth Thy gifts are not the gifts that others give, For Thou art kind unto them when they pray; And giv'st them bread on which their souls can live, Nor with a serpent sendst them poor away; The more they eat of all thy hand supplies, The more thy peace within abundant grows, Till all that is not thine forever dies, And heaven alone the perfect spirit knows; Then shall thy children ever find employ, In acts thy love has taught their hands to do; Each loved by Thee shall swell the other's joy, And every secret prayer be brought to view; By Thee who dwellst in secret, and will bring Into the light of life each hidden thing. Poem No. 712; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Good Gift Whate'er I ask I know I have from Thee, My Father, for Thou lovest me thy child; And would my spirit from his bondage free, Who first my infant feet from Thee beguiled; But Thou has taught me all his snares to shun, And in thy precepts walk forever sure; And when thy will on earth in Christ is done Thou wilt admit me to thy presence pure; Where he who has betrayed me cannot stand, For Thou hast placed the gulf of love between; And he who knows not of the new command, Cannot his robes in water ever clean; They must within the Lamb's own blood be dyed, That flows for me and all forever from his side. Poem No. 782; fall 1838âsummer 1839 History The History that thou hast never known, That is not on the record lying book; But by the light thou givest only shown, Canst thou on this, the truest page yet look? Then mayst thou leave all others; this the leaf, The healing leaf from off the tree of Life; It is not numbered by Time's cyphers brief, It higher dates than counts thy mortal strife; Its pages are the Scriptures; never read Till closed the eye that dust-soiled letters pores, And he who saw's forgotten with the dead; Then opes The Book Divine its heavenly stores, Its times man's living eras; still the same While burns within of God the sun-lit flame. Poem No. 510; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Spirit Land Open our eyes that we the world may see, Open our ears that we Thy Voice may hear, And in the Spirit-Land may ever be, And feel Thy Presence with us always near. No more to wander 'mid the things of time, No more to suffer death or earthly change; But with the Christian's joy &amp; faith sublime Thro' all Thy vast, eternal scenes to range. Tho' now against me beats the raging blast, And o'er my head in scornful triumph rides Soon soon the winter's bondage shall be past, To him who in the Savior's love confides Poem No. 393; fall 1838âsummer 1839 Thy Father's House Thou are not yet at home; perhaps thy feet Are on the threshold of thy father's door, But still thy journey is not there complete, If thou canst add to it but one step more; 'Tis not thy house which thou with feet can reach, 'Tis where when wearied they will enter not; But stop beneath an earthly roof, where each May for a time find comfort in his lot; Then called to wander soon again must mourn, That such frail shelter they should call relief; And onward seek again that distant bourne, The home of all the family of grief, Whose doors by day and night stand open wide For all who enter there shall evermore abide. Poem No. 662; fall 1838âsummer 1839 Jacob's Well Thou prayst not, save when in thy soul thou prayst; Disrobing of thyself to clothe the poor; The words thy lips shall utter then, thou sayst, They are as marble, and they shall endure; Pray always; for on prayer the hungry feed; Its sound is hidden music to the soul, From low desires the rising strains shall lead, And willing captives own thy just controul; Draw not too often on the gushing spring, But rather let its own o'erflowings tell, Where the cool waters rise, and thither bring Those who more gladly then will hail the well; When gushing from within new streams like thine, Shall bid them ever drink and own its source divine. Poem No. 689; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Day of Denial Are there not twelve whole hours in every day The sun upon thy dial marks for toil; How is it some but five, some seven say, And some among you of the whole make spoil? Thinkst thou to gain by taking from your life, By dying many hours to live the more? Dost thou not see the suicidal knife, Made hour by hour yet redder in thy gore? The day! the living day! how soon tis night, With him who rises not till near its noon; His candle lit for many hours to light, Put out e'er yet he learned to prize the boon; How dark his darkness, who till latest eve Still slumbers on nor then his couch will leave! Poem No. 51; fall 1838âsummer 1839 Spiritual Darkness A darkness, like the middle of the night, Clouds in the morn, and e'en the mid-day hours; Men wander round, as if devoid of sight, Or led astray by false, deluding powers! The wise knew not its coming, nor can tell Whence fell this darkness, like a plague on all; In vain they seek by knowledge to dispel The gloom, that shrouds the earth as with a pall. So, in eclipse, the sun withdraws his light, Or sheds a pale, and ineffectual ray; The flowers close up, as at the approach of night, And men, bewildered, wander from their way; The stars appear, and with faint lustre burn, Watching, from their far heights, the sun's return. Poem No. 5; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The New World The night that has no star lit up by God, The day that round men shines who still are blind, The earth their grave-turned feet for ages trod, And sea swept over by His mighty wind; All these have passed away; the melting dream That flitted o'er the sleeper's half-shut eye, When touched by morning's golden-darting beam; And he beholds around the earth and sky That ever real stands; the rolling spheres, And heaving billows of the boundless main, That show though time is past no trace of years, And earth restored he sees as his again; The earth that fades not, and the heavens that stand; Their strong foundations laid by God's right hand! Poem No. 532; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Word The voice that speaks when thou art in thy tomb, And spoke before thou sawst the morning light; This is the Word! of all that is the womb, Of all that see the never failing sight; Speechless yet ever speaking, none can hear The man grown silent in the praise of God; For they within him live, to hope and fear; They walk and speak, but he the grass-green sod; Its presence round them calls them hence to It, A Voice too great for murmur or reproof; A sun that shines till they are of it lit, Itself the utterance of Eternal Truth; Perfect, without a blemish; never found Save through the veil that wraps thy being round. Poem No. 588; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Field and Wood Whence didst thou spring, or art thou yet unborn; Who treadst with slighting foot so swift along, Where near thee rises green the bladed corn, And from the tree pours forth the bird's new song? Thy heart is ever fluttering, ne'er at rest; A bird that e'er would soar with wily art, Yet when she seems of what she wished possest, She feels the strength from out her wings depart; Learn wisdom from the sweet delaying voice, And from its melody turn not thine ear; With springing grain in slow decay rejoice, And thou at one shall be with all things here; And thy desires that now o'er-top the grain, Shall with its growth a life like theirs sustain. Poem No. 800; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Apostles The words that come unuttered by the breath, Looks without eyes, these lighten all the globe; They are the ministering angels, sent where Death Has walked so long the earth in seraph's robe; See crowding to their touch the groping blind! And ears long shut to sound are bent to hear, Quick as they speak the lame new vigor find, And language to the dumb man's lips is near; Hail sent to us, ye servants of high heaven! Unseen save by the humble and the poor; To them glad tidings have your voices given; For them their faith has wrought the wished for cure; And ever shall they witness bear of you, That he who sent you forth to heal was true. Poem No. 604; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The House I build a house, but in this 'twill appear; That I have built it not, a shining forth Of that bright palace that from year to year New pillars has and domes from my own worth; The wondrous hand that forms it; in the sea, In crystal depths fashions the coral pile, The sun-lit roof that o'er our heads we see, Earth's grassy plain that stretches mile on mile; 'Tis round me like the morning's presence, felt As that in which apart I live from all; A zone that girds me like Orion's belt, That I be seen the more on that bright wall, Where all, as golden constellations, shine With their own light, yet lit with Light Divine. Poem No. 216; fall 1838âsummer 1839 The Tenant Trees shall rise around thy dwelling, When thy house from heaven appears; Art thou that thou liv'st in selling, As are numbered up thy years? Thou canst ne'er have leave to enter That new dwelling's open door; Where thy hopes and wishes centre, Where thy friend has gone before; Till the hut where now thou livest, Low is leveled with the ground; Then thy prayer to Him who givest Has at length acceptance found. Then though poor, yet He will cherish, Whose high mansion is the sky; Houseless left thou shalt not perish 'Neath its wide-spread canopy. Quick then, leave some poorer dweller That wherein thou livest now; Better far awaits the seller, Richer lands his oxen plough. Poem No. 743; June or September 1839 This Morn Whence came this morn, this glorious morn, That hill and valley love so well? From Thee who gave me voice to sing, For they too of thy bounty tell. Look! how each leaf and grassy blade Return the glances of the morn; There is no beauty in the stream But of its brightness too is born. But none can tell how fair they are, Who do not with the morning live; And in its light find life with them, And like them always praises give. This morn, this brightly-beaming morn, Then shall they know it came from Thee; For they shall in its light rejoice, And own that they thy children be. Poem No. 798; June or September 1839 The Call Why art thou not awake my son? The morning breaks I formed for thee; And I thus early by thee stand, Thy new-awakening life to see. Why art thou not awake my son? The birds upon the bough rejoice; And I thus early by thee stand, To hear with theirs thy tuneful voice. Why sleepest thou still? the laborers all Are in my vineyard, hear them toil; As for the poor with harvest song, They treasure up the wine and oil. I come to wake thee; haste, arise, Or thou no share with me can find; Thy sandals seize, gird on thy clothes, Or I must leave thee here behind. Poem No. 816; summer 1839 The Prayer Wilt Thou not visit me? The plant beside me feels thy gentle dew; And every blade of grass I see, From thy deep earth its quickening moisture drew. Wilt Thou not visit me? Thy morning calls on me with cheering tone; And every hill and tree Lend but one voice, the voice of Thee alone. Come, for I need thy love; More than the flower the dew, or grass the rain, Come, gently as thy holy dove; And let me in thy sight rejoice to live again. I will not hide from them, When thy storms come, though fierce may be their wrath; But bow with leafy stem, And strengthened follow on thy chosen path. Yes, Thou wilt visit me: Nor plant nor tree thy parent eye delight so well; As when from sin set free My spirit loves with thine in peace to dwell. Poem No. 829; summer 1839 The Bride I sought of Thee my promised wife, She of the golden hair; But though I toiled with manly strife, Thou gave me one less fair. Again I toiled, and many a day My hands to labor flew; But Thou withheld again my pay, And gave me one less true. And still once more my limbs they plied Their strength to serve Thee Lord; But Thou wouldst not, though long I tried, With her my pains reward. But still for her I loved in youth, My nerves again are strung; And I will serve Thee still in truth, As when my limbs were young. And though the snows fall on my head, And lightless grows my eye; She of my youth I still may wed, And dwell with her on high. Poem No. 272; summer 1839 My Garden The eyes that would my garden see, Are not that outward objects view; For this my Father gave to me, And placed me here my work to do. At morn, at noon, and evening hour, With Him thou'lt find me at my toil; And when the night dews wet the flower, I watch lest thieves my treasures spoil. Come, see, the rose is budding here, The rose that blooms without a thorn; No weeds the vale-born lilies fear, That with their grace the spot adorn. The lily's cup, the rose is thine, If thou wilt give the strangers place; On them thou'lt read in many a line, The love that I have learned to trace. It grows with every springing blade; It falls with every evening dew; 'Tis this the light of morning made, And spangles night's dark curtain too. 'Tis this that gives each flower to me, And bids again each gift restore; That I may live with Him I see, And welcome those who pass my door. Poem No. 494; summer 1839 The Unripe Fruit I cannot wait, I cannot wait, The grapes, though sour, oh give to me: Or I must pluck them from the vine, Before the clusters ripened be. I cannot wait, I cannot wait, Shake down the green fruit from the bough: 'Tis hard and bitter to my taste; Yet I must eat it, Father, now. The grapes still cling, they will not give, To my unhallowed hasty hand; I know that thus with gentleness, Thou dost thy son's desire withstand. The bough though struck with lustful force, Will not the fruit thou gav'st let fall; I know it hangeth closely there, My sliding footsteps to recall. Yes I will wait and learn of Thee, Who giv'st each season to the year; And unto autumn hold'st the fruit, For him who walkest in thy fear. Poem No. 224; summer 1839 The Immortal 'Tis not that Thou hast given to me, A form which mortals cannot see, That I rejoice; But that I know Thou art around, And though there comes to me no sound, I hear thy voice. 'Tis not that Thou hast given me place, Among a new and happy race, I serve Thee, Lord; But that thy mercies never fail, And shall o'er all my sins prevail, Through thine own word. Its praise has gone abroad; who hears, He casts aside all earth-born fears, By it he lives; It bids him triumph o'er the grave, To him o'er death dominion gave, Thy joy and peace it gives. Hear it ye poor! and ye who weep! Arise who lie in sin's long sleep! 'Tis strong to free; Give ear and it shall lead you on, 'Till you the crown again have won, And me and mine can see. Poem No. 730; summer 1839 The Serving-Man Lord, thou hast many a serving-man, And better far than I; Yet leave Thee, Lord, I never can, Nor Him who bought deny. Thou brought me out of bondage sore, When sick and faint of heart; And can I ask for service more, Than never to depart. A Servant now I'll tend thy sheep, Nor know the master's joy; Yet I, if well thy fold I keep, Shall find a son's employ. O hasten, Father, hasten on, The days till all are past; And Thou when all my work is done, Wilt call me son at last. Poem No. 322; summer 1839 The Cottage The house my earthly parent left, My heavenly Father e'er throws down; For 'tis of air and sun bereft, Nor stars its roof in beauty crown. He gave it me, yet gave it not, As one whose gifts are wise and good: 'Twas but a poor and clay-built cot, And for a time the storms withstood; But lengthening years, and frequent rain, O'ercame its strength, it tottered, fell; And left me homeless here again, And where to go I could not tell. But soon the light and open air, Received me as a wandering child; And I soon thought their house more fair, And was from all my grief beguiled. Mine was the grove, the pleasant field, Where dwelt the flowers I daily trod; And there beside them too I kneeled, And called their friend, my Father, God. Poem No. 513; summer 1839 The Still-Born I saw one born, yet he was of the dead; Long since the spirit ceased to give us birth; For lust to sin, and sin to death had led, And now its children people o'er the earth. And yet he thought he lived, and as he grew Looked round upon the world and called it fair; For of the heaven he lost he never knew, Though oft he pined in spirit to be there. And he lived on, the earth became his home, Nor learnt he aught of those who came before; For they had ceased to wish from thence to roam; And for the better land could not deplore. Time passed, and he was buried; lo the dust, From which he first was taken him received; Yet in his dying hour ne'er ceased his trust, And still his soul for something heavenly grieved. And we will hope that there is One who gave, The rest he sighed for, but the world denied; That yet his voice is heard beyond the grave, That he yet lives who to our vision died. Poem No. 260; summer 1839 To-Day I live but in the present, where art thou? Hast thou a home in some past future year? I call to thee from every leafy bough, But thou art far away and canst not hear. Each flower lifts up its red or yellow head, And nods to thee as thou art passing by; Hurry not on, but stay thine anxious tread, And thou shalt live with me, for there am I. The stream that murmurs by thee, heed its voice, Nor stop thine ear, 'tis I that bid it flow; And thou with its glad waters shall rejoice, And of the life I live within them know. And hill, and grove, and flowers, and running stream, When thou dost live with them, shall look more fair; And thou awake as from a cheating dream, The life to-day with me and mine to share. Poem No. 241; summer 1839 The Withered Tree It stands 'mid other trees dry-barked, Its limbs with moss are overgrown; And many a gash its trunk has marked, Men sought for fruit but found there none. I saw them pass, a hungry crowd, With quickening steps and eager gaze; Then heard their wailings long and loud, Where should have rose the voice of praise. It stood for many years; the rain Fell on it, yet no leaf Came forth when stirs the sprouting grain, Nor summer's sun could bring relief. The roots, whence free the sap ascends, Had ceased to drink their rich supply; Nor sun nor shower the tree befriends, That does not on the earth rely. I heard the axe, when winter chills, Thick, sturdy blows, in haste it fell, And soon no more the place it fills, Nor smallest root the spot would tell. Poem No. 308; summer 1839 The Hour I ask not what the bud may be, That hangs upon the green-sheathed stem; But love with every leaf I see, To lie unfolded there like them. I ask not what the tree may bear, When whitened by the hand of spring; But with its blossoms on the air, Would far around my perfume fling. The infant's joy is mine, is mine, I join its infant sports with glee; And would not for a world resign, The look of love it casts on me. Leave not the bird upon the wing, But with her seek her shaded nest, And then with voice like hers thou'lt sing, When life's last sun-beam gilds the west. Poem No. 211; summerâfall 1839 The Old Road The road is left, that once was trod By man and heavy-laden beast; And new ways opened iron-shod, That bind the land from west to east. I asked of Him, who all things knows, Why none who lived now passed that way; Where rose the dust, the grass now grows? A still, low voice was heard to say: âThou know'st not why I change the course Of him who travels, learn to go;â Obey the spirit's gentle force, Nor ask thee, where the stream may flow.â âMan shall not walk in his own ways, For he is blind and cannot see; But let him trust, and lengthened days Shall lead his feet to heaven and Me.â âThen shall the grass the path grow o'er, That his own willfulness has trod; Nor man nor beast shall pass it more, But he shall walk with Me, his God.â Poem No. 552; summerâfall 1839 The Fair Morning The clear bright morning, with its scented air, And gaily waving flowers, is here again; Man's heart is lifted with the voice of prayer, And peace descends as falls the gentle rain; The tuneful birds that all the night have slept, Take up at dawn the evening's dying lay; When sleep upon their eyelids gently crept, And stole with stealthy craft their song away; High overhead the forest's swaying boughs, Sprinkle with drops of dew the whistling boy; As to the field he early drives his cows More than content with this his low employ; And shall not joy uplift me when I lead, The flocks of Christ by the still streams to feed? Poem No. 478; summerâfall 1839 The Clouded Morning The morning comes; and thickening fogs prevail, Hanging like curtains all the horizon round; And o'er the head in heavy stillness sad; So still is day, it seems like night profound; But see! the mists are stirring, rays of light Pierce through the haze as struggling to be free, The circle round grows every moment bright, The sun is breaking forth, 'tis he, 'tis he; Quick from before him flies each sluggish cloud, His rays have touched the stream, have climbed the hill; The sounds of life increase, all blending loud; The hum of men, nor smallest thing is still; But all have found a voice, and hail their king, The words of man's high praise, and bird with fluttering wing. Poem No. 530; summerâfall 1839 The Plagues of Egypt I see them spreading o'er the land, The swarming locust fly; More numerous than the small-grained sand, They speed them from on high. O'er golden crops that gallant waved, O'er groves with foliage green; They march; not e'en the grass is saved, Nor hill nor flood can screen. And lice within men's dwellings creep, More small than finest dust; Their kneading troughs, and where they sleep; They eat their flesh like rust. Repent! e'er yet your eldest born, Be stricken at your side; Repent! e'er yet ye see the morn, The wave with blood be dyed. For He who lives will Israel call, From out their bondage sore; And Egypt's pride again shall fall, And Egypt's sons deplore. Poem No. 267; summerâfall 1839 The Dark Day A darkness like the middle of the night Clouds in the morn and e'en the mid-day hours; Men wander round as if devoid of sight, Or led astray by false deluding powers; The wise knew not its coming, nor can tell Whence fell this blackness like a plague on all; Nor will it yield to e'en their strongest spell; Nor heed their gods though on their names they call; The hand that spread the veil alone dispels, For this alone obeys the all-seeing God; The night that fell where sin in splendor dwells, Shall flee again when waves the obedient rod; As mists that from the low, damp earth will fly, When gains the sun upon the eastern sky. Poem No. 3; summerâfall 1839 The Removal When he who owns a house has come to thee, And begs you move, for he must enter in; Dost thou not pay, when asked, his little fee, And for thy journeying hence right quick begin? But I, when I have come: who own no land, Nor houses built of wood, or wrought of stone; Why dost thou waiting and uncertain stand, As if the house I let was not my own? âI have been here so long it seems like mine,â Thou sayst; âbut still the more ought thou to leave;â âMy children here were born; can I resignâ âMy all, and thou a stranger too?â âbelieveâ âAnd thou canst do it; and I grant yet moreâ âA better house for thine I will restore.â Poem No. 786; summerâfall 1839 The Rain The rain descends; each drop some drooping flowers, Or parched blade drinks in with grateful haste; Nor is there from the plenteous falling shower, A drop that nature will permit to waste; The river swells beneath the pattering rain, And as a seine its face is dotted o'er; It falls not on the barren path in vain, But drunken quick it asks to have yet more; Nor think that where the pool untasted stands, As if its life refused the sullen earth; That there the wave is spilt upon the sands, To-morrow's sun shall see the duck's rude mirth; As there it sails or drinks with snuffling bill, Rejoiced that there is spared its thirst with theirs to fill. Poem No. 550; fall 1839 The Frost The frost is out amid our open fields, And late within the woods I marked his track; The unwary flower his icy fingers feels, And at their touch the crisped leaf rolls back. Look, how the maple, o'er a sea of green, Waves in the autumnal wind its flag of red! First struck of all the forest's spreading screen, Most beauteous, too, thou earliest of her dead! Go on; thy task is kindly meant by him, Whose is each flower, and richly covered bough; And though the leaves hang dead on every limb, Still will I praise his love; that early now Has sent before this herald of decay, To bid me heed the approach of winter's sterner day. Poem No. 502; fall 1839 Autumn Days The winds are out with loud increasing shout, Where late before them walked the biting frost; Whirling the leaves in their wild sport about, And strewing twig and limb our path acrost; But still the sun looks kindly on the year, And days of summer warmth will linger yet; And still the birds amid the fields we hear, For the ripe grain and scattered seeds they get; The shortening days grow slowly less and less, And winter comes with many a warning on; And still some day with kindly smile will bless, Till the last hope's deceit is fledged and gone; Before the deepening snows block up the way, And the sweet fields are made of howling blasts the prey. Poem No. 595; fall 1839 Autumn Leaves The leaves though thick are falling; one by one Decayed they drop from off their parent tree; Their work with autumn's latest day is done, Thou see'st them borne upon its breezes free; They lie strown here and there, their many dyes That yesterday so caught thy passing eye; Soiled by the rain each leaf neglected lies, Upon the path where now thou hurriest by; Yet think thee not their beauteous tints less fair, Than when they hung so gaily o'er thy head; But rather find thee eyes, and look thee there Where now thy feet so heedless o'er them tread; And thou shalt see where wasting now they lie, The unseen hues of immortality. Poem No. 519; fall 1839 The Lost Sheep Though many, many sheep I have, I leave them all to find the one That high upon the mountain strays; And think'st thou not I well have done? For all are His who gave them me, And bade with closest watching keep, Nor suffer one, however poor, To wander from his numerous sheep. Hast thou e'er kept them? then wilt thou A brother in affliction know; And if the lost one thou hast seen Wilt point him where his feet should go. And when restored each one shall be, With joy our flocks we'll homeward lead; For He who lent them but a day, Will give us always them to feed. Poem No. 707; fall 1839 The Shepherd's Life My flocks hadst thou e'er seen them, where they feed Upon the hills and flowery-vestured plains; And heard me pipe to them on Shepherd's reed, Then would'st thou leave fore'er thy sordid gains; And haste thee where the streams so gently flow, Where sounding pines and rocks above me rise; And seek this quiet life of mine to know, And learn its simple joys with me to prize. How quietly the morning melts away Into the noon, while on the grass I lie; And noon fades quickly into evening gray, When troop the stars across the o'erhanging sky. Here day by day I know, nor want, nor care, For all I need has love paternal given; And bid me bounteous all its blessings share, And know on earth the bliss of those in heaven. Thine be the Shepherd's life, his cot be thine, And may'st thou sit beside him at his board; Then wilt thou cease to sorrow, or repine, And to the peace Christ gave him be restored. Poem No. 337; fall 1839 The Good Samaritan There journeyed from the south a man, To one whom in the north he'd seen; And many a river's tide rolled on, And many a city rose between. At first he travelled hard and strong, For to his friend his heart was bound; But slow and slower grew his pace, And many a resting place he found. At last forgot he him he loved, And that he e'er was journeying there; They called him friend whom he had met, And bade with them their living share. But soon another journeyed by, To seek the friend that first he sought; He tarried not, though tempted much, Nor could from his first love be bought. Still on he held his noble way, And he who had forgot his end; Gained strength as he beheld him walk, And rose and found with him his friend. Poem No. 632; fall 1839 The Birds of Passage Whence comes those many-colored birds, That fill with songs each field and bower; When Winter's blasts their force have spent, And spring to summer brings her dower. I've watched them, but I know not whence With voices all-attuned they fly; 'Tis from some distant, unknown land, Some sunnier clime and fairer sky. And these the notes they bring to tell, Of that unseen and distant home; To tempt us who are living here, With them when winter comes to roam. Had I but wings I would not stay, When chilling cold I feel him near; But with them journeying there I'd fly, That unknown land of which I hear. Poem No. 799; fall 1839 The Feast The hour of noon is fully come, Yet none of all I ask'd are here; And now it grows towards the eve, Still none arrive to taste my cheer. I asked them all; the rich, the poor, For all are welcome to my board; But none will be my guests to day, And eat of what my stores afford. One, busy, is at home detained; Another hies him to his farm; Some other day a third would suit; For each there's something else to charm. But still my house shall be o'erflowed! And they who were not honored first Will come when I my servants send, And at my table quench their thirst. But they who scorned my offered feast, Shall eat of what their hearts now choose; 'Till they will learn to live with me, And share the meat that they refuse. Poem No. 512; fall 1839 The Ramble The plants that careless grow shall flower and bud, When wilted stands man's nicely tended flower; E'en on the unsheltered waste, or pool's dark mud, Spring bells and lilies fit for ladies' bower; Come with me, I will show you where they grow; The tangled vines and boughs come push aside; O'er yonder hill top's craggy side we go, Then by the path beyond we downward slide; See by yond pond where few but travellers pass, Each lily opens wide its curious cup; And here where now we track the unmown grass, The wild-heath bell surprised is looking up, To view the strangers that thus far have sought The flowers that in fair nature's robe are wrought. Poem No. 541; fall 1839 The Barberry Bush The bush which bears most briars, and bitter fruit, Wait till the frost has turned its green leaves red, Its sweetened berries will thy palate suit, And thou may'st find, e'en there, a homely bread. Upon the hills of Salem, scattered wide, Their yellow blossoms gain the eye in Spring; And straggling down upon the turnpike's side, Their ripened bunches to your hand they bring. I've plucked them oft in boyhood's early hour, What then I gave such name, and thought it true; But now I know, that other fruit, as sour, Grows on what now thou callest Me, and You; Yet, wilt thou wait the Autumn that I see, 'Twill sweeter taste than these red berries be. Poem No. 475; fall 1839 The Hand and the Foot The hand and foot that stir not, they shall find Sooner than all the rightful place to go; Now in their motion free as roving wind, Though first no snail so limited and slow; I mark them full of labor all the day, Each active motion made in perfect rest; They cannot from their path mistaken stray, Though 'tis not theirs, yet in it they are blest; The bird has not their hidden track found out, Nor cunning fox though full of art he be; It is the way unseen, the certain route, Where ever bound, yet thou art ever free; The path of Him, whose perfect law of love Bids spheres and atoms in just order move. Poem No. 505; fall 1839 The Eye and Ear Thou readest, but each lettered word can give Thee but the sound that thou first gave to it; Thou lookest on the page, things move and live In light thine eye and thine alone has lit; Ears are there yet unstopped, and eyes unclosed, That see and hear as in one common day; When they which present see have long reposed, And he who hears has mouldered too to clay; These ever see and hear; they are in Him, Who speaks, and all is light; how dark before! Each object throws aside its mantle dim, That hid the starry robe that once it wore; And shines full-born disclosing all that is, Itself by all things seen and owned as His. Poem No. 690; fall 1839 The Sunset When left the sun the distant west, Still lingering there appears his light; So when a spirit leaves the world, Its sunset rays will point its flight. None leave it now; their suns still stand Yet high above the horizon's bound; No rays e'er come from other skies, To show another world they've found. If thou hast seen one die from earth, Mark well his path along the sky; And when his orb sinks from thy gaze, Still on the west keep fixed thine eye; And follow on; nor doubt the beams That upward shoot shall lead thee on; To where a sun he'll ever blaze, Nor light come back to mark him gone. Poem No. 790; fall 1839 Yourself 'Tis to yourself I speak; you cannot know Him whom I call in speaking such an one, For thou beneath the earth liest buried low, Which he alone as living walks upon; Thou mayst at times have heard him speak to you, And often wished perchance that you were he; And I must ever wish that it were true, For then thou couldst hold fellowship with me; But now thou hearst us talk as strangers, met Above the room wherein thou liest abed; A word perhaps loud spoken thou mayst get, Or hear our feet when heavily they tread; But he who speaks, or him who's spoken to, Must both remain as strangers still to you. Poem No. 733; fall 1839 Thy Better Self I am thy other self, what thou wilt be, When thou art I, the one thou seest now; In finding thy true self thou wilt find me, The springing blade, where now thou dost but plough. I am thy neighbor, a new house I've built, Which thou as yet hast never entered in; I come to call thee; come in when thou wilt, The feast is always ready to begin. Thou should'st love me, as thou dost love thyself, For I am but another self beside; To show thee him thou lov'st in better health, What thou would'st be, when thou to him hast died; Then visit me, I make thee many a call; Nor live I near to thee alone, but all. Poem No. 210; fall 1839 The Glutton The bread thou eatest thou canst never know, That sums untold could never buy thee such; Or to thy Father's board thou wouldst not go, With hasty hands his gifts as now to clutch; The bread thus eaten, it can never feed; Save the lost life that thus in haste is stole; Thou drinkest, but of more must soon have need; 'Tis not the fount of life that fills the bowl; Thou art not there where spreads the kind repast, But thine own will is guest where thou shouldst be; And that which was but born in thee to fast, Has bid thee serve that should from bonds be free; And thou a servant wait'st where thou mightst sit, While sin's foul carrion-bird upon thy dish has lit. Poem No. 470; fall 1839 The Day not for Gain When comes the sun to visit thee at morn, Art thou prepared to give him welcome then? Or is the day, that with his light is born, With thee, a day that has already been. Hast thou filled up its yet unnumbered hours With selfish thoughts, and made them now thine own? Then not for thee will bloom its budding flowers, The day, to thee, has past, and onward flown. The noon may follow with its quickening heat, The grain grow yellow in its ripening rays; And dusky evening mark the noon's retreat, Yet thou as dead to them live all thy days; For thou hast made of God's free gifts a gain, And would'st the sovereign Day, a slave, in bonds retain. Poem No. 784; fall 1839 The World The end of all thou seest is near, The world that looks so wide and high, Shall vanish like the melting cloud, Nor smallest spot will meet thine eye. But thou must bid its vesture change, And ope another eye within; The spirit calls thee, haste! arise! Awake thee from the death of sin! Thou sow'st not now what will appear, But the bare grain of wrong desire; Soon this shall moulder in decay, And then thy new-brought form admire. Then shall thine eye behold the world, From which at first the spirit fell; And kindred never known before, In numbers more than words can tell. Then haste to close that outward eye, And stop thee soon thine earthly ear; And thou shalt walk a child of light, And him who breaks thy slumbers hear. Poem No. 493; fall 1839 The House Not Made With Hands, Eternal In The Heavens There is a house not built with hands, Where all who enter shall abide; Above where eye can reach it stands, Whence all depart, who here have died. Beneath, it rests on many a gem, Dug from the heart's deep, darkest mine; Thou who art toiling now for them, Shalt see them there in radiance shine. Of gold the floor, the gold of love, Thrice in affliction's fire made pure; There feet of angels ever move, There dwell the just in peace secure. The light is brighter than the day, Reflected from its crystal walls; Thou see'st at times a glimmering ray, Which to its courts thy spirit calls. And thou shalt dwell, and worship there, When thou hast put thy garment on; The Savior doth that house prepare, There all the pure in heart have gone. Poem No. 613; fall 1839 The Broken Bowl The fountain flows, but where the bowl To catch from heaven the living stream; That ever shall refresh the soul, And make life's ills a passing dream? 'Tis broken at the cistern, broke; Its waters spilled upon the ground; The words of old, the preacher spoke, I too their truth like him have found. Prepare, prepare new vessels still, Though broken fragments round thee lie; Thou must from hence thy pitcher fill, And often drink, or thou wilt die. Behold the Rock, that smitten gave To Israel on the burning sand, Life, in its cool, refreshing wave; 'Twill flow when smitten by thy hand. Ho all that thirst! come, drink ye all! The fountain pours its waters free; Come, heed the prophet's early call, Fashion new bowls and draw with me. Poem No. 501; late 1839 The Bunch of Flowers I saw a bunch of flowers, and Time With withered hand was plucking one; I wondering asked him as I passed, For what the thing I saw was done. My gifts are these, the flowers you see; For her who comes I hold this rose; I looked; the nurse held out her child, Just wakened from its sweet repose. Its small hand clasped the prize with joy, Each seemed the other to the eye; But soon the flowers' bright leaves were strown, And while I gazed a youth came by. The flower Time gave to him he held, And more admired; and kept awhile; Yet as I watched him on his way, 'Twas dropped e'er he had paced a mile. Man kept it longer; 'twas to him a gift, And with it long was loathe to part; But as he journeyed on I saw The rose lay withered on his heart. One aged came; still he received Time's gift; But as he took it heaved a sigh; It dropt from out his trembling grasp, And at Time's feet his offering lie. Then knew I none could bear away the flower, That Time on each and all bestows; Nor would I take his gift when he, To me in turn held out a rose. Poem No. 254; late 1839 Hymn Home I sought my home;âan earthly guide First led me to a house of wood; And there he told me to abide, Content with shelter, rest, and food. But He who teaches all the way, Oft from my dwelling turned my feet; And when my heart would backward stray, Did my fond purpose still defeat. Long time I wandered;âstill the voice Forbade me, where I wished, to go; Till I would yield to it my choice, And only of its leading know. Then I no longer sought my home, For where I was, 'twas there to me; Nor could I ever wish to roam, My bonds were broke, and I was free. Hast thou not found thy dwelling yet, Then leave the guide, whose eyes are blind; And thou shalt earth's frail house forget, And God's own habitation find. Poem No. 271; late 1839 The Ghost There passes by at dead of night, When thou in sleep's embrace art lost; One never seen by mortal sight, And whom no mortal may accost. His hand unheard tries every door, If he an entrance there can win; But still asleep he hears men snore, And few rise up to let him in. But if he finds one watching still, His door unbarred though late the hour; With untold wealth that house he'll fill, For he o'er riches holds the power. And health and plenty crown his lot, Whose board long waits that stranger guest; Who weary will not seek his cot, Till he beside him there can rest. Poem No. 633; late 1839 The Seasons I will not call it Spring for me Till every leaf I've seen, And every springing blade of grass, Has its last touch of green; Till every blossom I can count, Upon the budding bough; Then will I call it spring for me, I cannot see it now. I will not call the Summer come, Till every blade shall fall Beneath the mower's swinging scythe, The low grass and the tall; Till where each red and white bud stood, Hangs fruit for autumn's hand; But yet I cannot say 'tis here, And I will waiting stand. I will not say that Autumn's hour Is come, is come to me, Till every apple ripened hangs Upon the loaded tree; Till every flower that's owned of Spring, Where'er my path shall lead, Shall shake and rattle in the wind Its stalk and cherished seed. Then will I say that Winter's near, But not that he is found; Till deep the snows have buried all The fields and trees around; And every rippling brook that runs To water grove and flower, I see lie stiffened by his breath, And hushed beneath his power. Poem No. 284; late 1839 The Silent There is a sighing in the wood, A murmur in the beating wave, The heart has never understood To tell in words the thoughts they gave. Yet oft it feels an answering tone, When wandering on the lonely shore; And could the lips its voice make known, 'Twould sound as does the ocean's roar. And oft beneath the wind swept pine, Some chord is struck the strain to swell; Nor sounds nor language can define, 'Tis not for words or sounds to tell. 'Tis all unheard; that Silent Voice, Whose goings forth, unknown to all, Bids bending reed and bird rejoice, And fills with music nature's hall. And in the speechless human heart It speaks, where'er man's feet have trod; Beyond the lip's deceitful art, To tell of Him, the Unseen God. Poem No. 614; late 1839 The Way To good thou ask'st the wayâenter the street, This is the broad high-way that many tread; Go follow him whom first thine eye shall meet, Here is his store, go in; behold thy bread; Thou turn'st away; well, follow him whose ship Has just returned deep-laden from afar; Look, see his face how gladdened at the trip. Is there aught here the good thou seek'st to mar? Still as thou trackest one and all thou find'st it not; Then learn that all are seekers here below; And let the lesson never be forgot, That none the path to happiness can show, Save He whose way is hidden; only known To those who seek his love, and his alone. Poem No. 737; late 1839 The Sun Where has the sun a home? didst thou e'er trace His course when sinking in the distant west, And see him there begin anew his race, As if of new-born strength again possest? Or didst thou leave him in the western skies, Where late his setting glories called thee on; Nor follow on with still admiring eyes, Another earth to bless where he has gone? Stay not where night shuts in on all who sleep, Faint travellers on the path he onward trod; But on his beams a waking eye still keep, The daily herald sent to thee from God; And thou when many suns thy year has known, Shall rise with him his brightness all thine own. Poem No. 803; late 1839 The Worm I saw a worm, with many a fold, It spun itself a silken tomb; And there in winter time enrolled, It heeded not the cold or gloom. Within a small, snug nook it lay, Nor snow nor sleet could reach it there, Nor wind was felt in gusty day, Nor biting cold of frosty air. Spring comes with bursting buds and grass, Around him stirs a warmer breeze; The chirping insects by him pass, His hiding place not yet he leaves. But summer came, its fervid breath, Was felt within the sleeper's cell; And waking from his sleep of death, I saw him crawl from out his shell. Slow and with pain it first moved on, And of the dust it seemed to be; A day passed by; the worm was gone, It soared on golden pinions free. Poem No. 257; late 1839 The Watcher He comes at dead of night, when all asleep Are sunk in nature's most profound repose; No eye can then its watchful vigil keep, Nor hears there one, though loud HIS frequent blows; I was a Watcher, whom the hours o'ercame, And heavy slumber weighed my eyelids down; A sleep like death oppressed my weary frame, I fell, a traitor to my own renown; Yet HE who called me, HE was faithful still; I heard at length HIS knocking loud and long, And hastened then my dying lamp to fill, And ope the door with bolts and hinges strong; That he who bid me wake might enter in, And I anew with him the watch begin. Poem No. 160a; late 1839? The Physician There is a body, every joint and limb Is still, yet moves by God's all-holy law; The eye turns here and there, yet turns in him, The ear no sound but his own words can draw; Its voice the long-stopped ear obedient hears, The withered hand outstretched its bidding owns, And they who mourn the dead dry up their tears, The prison walls hear not their captive's groans; Through the wide world of living death it brings A new-born life wherever it walks abroad; Such as beneath the feet of May up springs When forth she steps where Winter late has trod; And at her coming starts the palsied year, That slumbers on though summer months are near. Poem No. 611a; late 1839? The Miser How much there is within this rich abode, Thou pass'st uncared for by and call'st it thine; Forever straying from the narrow road, 'Mid heaven's own joys, yet still for heaven to pine; The light that comes to thee thou had'st before; The gold shines not within the miser's hand, But he already sighs to have yet more; What thou just gave him,â'twas his house and land; Turn where thou wilt,âalas! where canst thou turn, Who goest before as though already there;â Turn where thou wilt, thou dost each blessing spurn; Who cares for nought how little feels he care, Though all the day sweet angels hovering near, Are sent his onward path with their glad news to cheer. Poem No. 194a; late 1839? The Spheres The brightness round the rising sun, It shall be thine if thou wilt rise; Thou too hast thine own race to run, And pour thy light on waiting eyes. The expectant millions eager turn, Oft when thy coming streaks the east; And ask when shall his glory burn, Aloft to mid-day's light increased. And star on star when thine has lit The o'erhanging dome of earth's wide heaven, Shall rise, for as by Him 'tis writ, Who to each sun its path has given. And all with thine, each wheeling sphere In ways harmonious on shall move; Tracing with golden bounds the year Of the Great Parent's endless love. Poem No. 471; late 1839âearly 1840 The Builders There are who wish to build their houses strong, Yet of the earth material they will take; And hope the brick, within the fire burnt long, A lasting home for them, and theirs will make. And one, who thought him wiser than the rest, Of the firm granite hewed his dwelling proud; And all who passed this eagle's lofty nest Praised his secure retreat from tempests loud. They built for Time; and Time reclaimed his own, Their palaces he toppled to the ground; By grass and moss their ruins were o'ergrown, I looked for them, but they could not be found. But one I knew who sought him out no wood, No brick, nor stone, though as the others born; And those who passed, where waiting still he stood, Made light of him, and laughed his hopes to scorn. And Time went by, and he was waiting still; No house had he, and seemed to need one less; He felt that waiting yet his master's will Was the best shelter in this wilderness. And I beheld the rich man, and the wise, When lapsing years fell heavy on each shed; As one by one they fled, in lonely guise, To this poor man for refuge, and for bread. Poem No. 610; late 1839âearly 1840 Give and it shall be given unto you. Spiritual Debtors I was heavy-laden, grieving, Prest to earth with sense of woe; When a voice, my grief relieving, Sounded thus in accents low: Every man that's now thy debtor, Shall his debt to thee repay; Shall restore e'en to the letter, All thy spirit gives away. Old and youngâthe man grey-headed, And the boy with nimble tread; They that to the world are wedded, All that now by thee are fed. They, how much shall they return thee, Crowded measures running o'er; All that now in spirit owe thee, Grieve my child, then grieve no more. Poem No. 283; late 1839âearly 1840 The Laborers The workman shall not always work; who builds, His house shall finish with the last-raised stone; The last small measure full the vessel fills; The last step taken and thy journey's done; But where is he, who but one hour ago, Lifted with toiling arm the burthen nigh; And he whose vessel to the brim did flow, Or he who laid his staff and sandals by? I see them still at work another way, From those that late thou sawest thus employed; And heard them each unto the other say, As to new tasks they bent them overjoyed, âThe sun is rising, haste! that he may see, When setting, every hand from labor free.â Poem No. 605; late 1839âearly 1840 The Unfaithful Servants Thou hast no other hands than those that toil, In other tasks than what thou giv'st them now; For these thou hast the others' work but spoil, They idly tear the ground that these would plough; They have been long employed, and learnt them arts, The others know and yet were never taught; False actors saying to themselves their parts, Till they the gait and living tone have caught; 'Tis but a show, these buildings that they rear, Card-fabrics overblown with every breath; Their mightiest labor, things that but appear; An out-seen world; begat of thee by death, When first thine eye began to cease to see, And made; when first thy hand forgot a hand to be. Poem No. 679; late 1839âearly 1840 The Thieves The night was dark and I alone, When midnight's stillest hours begin; There smote my door a heavy stone, And one for plunder broke within. He took whate'er I valued high, My books, and often-counted gold; Nor heeded he my strength or cry, For I was young, and he was old. My neighbors in the morning came, Who long had taught me they were mine, And too a better life laid claim; And bade me not for them repine. For they would all restore to me, The thief last night had stole away; And brought these books, this gold you see, Far more than he had made his prey. Yet I would not their offerings take, For they who learned me so to live, That I such gifts mine own would make, But rob me more the more they give. Poem No. 533; late 1839âearly 1840 The Strangers Each care-worn face is but a book To tell of houses bought or sold; Or filled with words that men have took From those who lived and spoke of old. I see none whom I know, for they See other things than him they meet; And though they stop me by the way, 'Tis still some other one to greet. There are no words that reach my ear, Those speak who tell of other things Than what they mean for me to hear, For in their speech the counter rings. I would be where each word is true, Each eye sees what it looks upon; For here my eye has seen but few, Who in each act that act have done. Poem No. 102; late 1839âearly 1840 The Light from Within I saw on earth another light Than that which lit my eye; Come forth as from my soul within, And from a higher sky. Its beams shone still unclouded on, When in the farthest west The sun I once had known had sunk Forever to his rest. And on I walked though dark the night Nor rose his orb by day, As one who by a surer guide Was pointed out the way. 'Twas brighter far than noon-day's beam, It shone from God within; And lit as by a lamp from heaven The world's dark track of sin. Poem No. 259; late 1839âearly 1840 [Thou know'st not what thy Lord will say] Thou know'st not what thy Lord will say, He knows thee and not thou him And tho' unseen thou wert He Can still thy every action see While thou wert busy here and there So He was here and he is gone Thou oft has time enough to spare But He thy Lord and Master now. Then quickly do the thing thou doest And quickly speak the flying word Nor to thyself a moment trust For he who trusts himself is weak Poem No. 683; late 1839âearly 1840 The Good The useful and the sweet the fair and true Do grow together the same plant always From truth, the root, the flower puts forth in view With scent and beauty the design to praise. And good the earth or wave that deep or thin Gives all to all yet nothing takes away Itself Itself forever holds within The unfolded whole of all that can decay For Truth and Beauty are but tree or plant And that we eat but fruit, and smell but flowers The spirit cannot things of earth of long want It dwells not in Time's autumn fading bowers But there where all in all the hand, the face And breath like fragrance mingling with the air Reveals a form that Perfect Love will trace The Holy One within the House of Prayer. Poem No. 586; late 1839âearly 1840 The Distant How far hast thou travelled? Though many thy years, And many a day thou hast seen to its close; Hast thou seen to their end all thy hopes and thy fears, Or found where the sun has gone to repose? The still-growing leaf that thy door springs beside, Hast thou seen whence it draws all its bright tints of green? Or found where the rain or the swift wind can hide, Or traced to their deep the cloud's colored screen? Nay, has thy sight followed the fire's warm heat That burns on thy hearth on the cold winter's day? Or gone with the flame to its hidden retreat When thy lamp in the midnight shoots up its last ray? Thine eye is but dim if thou hast not found the home Of these thy companions in journeying here; Thy feet to the earth's farthest borders may roam, Nor thou to the end of life's path be more near. Poem No. 184; late 1839âearly 1840 A Word The silent history of a word, Borne on Time's stream along, Has never yet been sung or heard, It asks the voice of song. 'Twas born from the soul's calm deep, Smit by the chastening rod; As Eve, flesh-formed from Adam's sleep, Touched by the hand of God. It wandered o'er the unyielding earth, By war and famine worn, A stranger seen, of unknown birth; Though night, a child of morn. 'Twas welcomed in the lowly cot, 'Twas heard in kingly hall; And men their arms and strife forgot, In listening to its call. It told of peace that would not fail, Of love that could not die; 'Twas felt beneath the warrior's mail, It dried the mourner's eye. I looked along the path it took, As told by legends old Repeated oft from book to book; It shone as shining gold. A furrow through earth's barren field, Ploughed deep, and sown with care; But none to notice what it yields, Or in its harvest share. Poem No. 561; early 1840 The Settler When thou art done thy toil, anew art born; With hands that never touched the spade or plough, Nor in the furrows strewed the yellow corn, Or plucked the ripened fruit from off the bough: Then shall thou work begin;âthy plough and spade Shall break at early morn the virgin soil; The swelling hill and thickly wooded glade With changing aspect own the daily toil; Thy house shall strike the eye, where none are near, For thou hast travelled far, where few have trod; And those who journey hence will taste thy cheer, And bless thee as a favored one of God; For He it was who in this pathless wild, Upon thy good intent so richly smiled. Poem No. 795; early 1840? The Dwellings of the Just I saw the dwellings of the Just, No sun was in their sky; Nor candle lit their rooms by night, They saw without an eye. They walked upright as fearing none, Each step so true they trod; They moved as those who had been taught The perfect law of God. All day they labored, yet at rest, As in His sight who lives; Who to teach one his rightful place, And rightful portion gives. And shadowy night was blessed to them, As His who gives the day; And sweet the sleep it brought to these, Whose joy was to obey. Poem No. 263; early 1840? Death Men live and die in secret; none can see When going out or lighting up the flame, Save the all-seeing eye;âfrail mortals, we Call death and life what are but so in name; Death is that shunning Him who bids thee die, Which thou but disobedience learnst to call; Words cannot hide thee from the searching eye, That sees thy corse beneath their sable pall; And life the lifting up that thou dost feel, When thy feet follow where he bids thee go; A life beyond disease, or severing steel, That nought but him who gives it, fears below; This be thy life, and death shall flee away, For thou hast learned for ever to obey. Poem No. 327; early 1840? The Birth-Day of the Soul The birth-day of the Soul how sweet its dawn! It comes to me, and yet for all it is; Upon the skies its colored form is drawn, The green earth says 'tis hers, the sea 'tis his; The voice of feathered tribes thick-swarming tell The day is born to fields and waiting grove, The meadow's song and forest's rising swell Are heard by gladsome winds that o'er them rove. 'Tis music all;âbut higher song than these Bears witness also to the day's glad birth; They but the ear of sense a moment please; The song I hear is not of sense, or earth; But such as waiting angels joyful sing, When from its wanderings home a soul they bring. Poem No. 465; early 1840? The Bee Hive The hive the honey-bee has found, With loaded wings and heavy sides; Stands in a garden fenced around, Where she called Industry resides. In and out her menials fly On their journeys one by one, As she sends them far and nigh Telling each what must be done. Are there flowers on crag or dell Overladen with their sweets, Quick the humming insects tell Heard within their wild retreats. Do they bloom on open field, Or the sheltered walks of men; Not the humblest is concealed, There her messengers have been. All the day in quiet haste Thus they do their mistress' will, Suffering not a drop to waste That may go her hive to fill. Poem No. 511; early 1840? Time's House The stones of time's old house with pelting storms, That on it long have beat from day to day, Are loose; the door is gone, and smoke deforms The boards within and walls of plastered clay; Long have his children strove to keep it whole; By many a wile he's taught them to make good, The waste that creeping years have from it stole, And long its walls the ruin have withstood; But now within and out the storms assail. Its beams rock to and fro with every gust; And fears o'er cherished hopes at last prevail, Nor longer to its threatening roof they'll trust; But cease to patch each rent with jealous care, And learn at last to live beneath the open air. Poem No. 575; early 1840? The Fox and the Bird The bird that has no nest, The Fox that has no hole; He's wiser than the rest, Her eggs are never stole. She builds where none can see, He hides where none can find; The bird can rest where'er she be, He freely moves as wind. Thou hast not found her little young, E'en though thou'st sought them long; Though from thine earliest day they've sung, Thou hast not heard their song. Thou hast not found that Fox's brood, That nestle under ground; Though through all time his burrow's stood, His whelps thou'st never found. Poem No. 463; early 1840? Faith and Light The comings on of Faith, The goings out of Light; Are as the brightening of the morn, And dying of the night. Man tells not of the hour, By Him alone 'tis told; Who day and night with certain bounds, Marked out for him of old! The singing of the bird, And sinking of her strain; The roar of ocean's storm-lashed waves, And lull; the date retain. The fading of the leaf, And blending of each hue; The hour still hold in truth, When change the old and new. There's nought in nature's hymn, Of earth, or sea, or sky; But tells, forever tells, the time, When birth to death is nigh. Poem No. 480; early 1840? The Word The Word where is it? hath it voice, That I may hear it and be free; Hath it a form, that I may know; A touch, that I may feel; and see? Where does it dwell? above, below? Or is it where e'en now I tread? I would be near it when it calls, And bids awake the slumbering dead. 'Tis near me; yet I hear it notâ âThat voice that cometh down from heavenâ And hide myself in shrinking fear, When wide above the earth is riven. Oh strengthen in me faith to rise, And go where'er it leads the way; That I may live with it as one, And all that it commands obey. Poem No. 602; early 1840? The Absent Thou art not yet at home in thine own house, But to one room I see thee now confined; Having one hole like rat or skulking mouse, And as a mole to all the others blind; Does the great Day find preference when he shines In at each window lighting every room? No selfish wish the moon's bright glance confines, And each in turn the stars' faint rays illume; Within thy sleeping room thou dost abide, And thou the social parlor dost prefer; Another thou wilt in the cupboard hide, And this or that's the room for him or her; But the same sun, and moon with silver face Look in on all, and lighten every place. Poem No. 661; early 1840? The Pilgrim 'Twas in the winter at the close of day, The snow fell deep upon the traveller's path, I saw one journeying on infirm and grey Yet seemed he not to heed the tempest's wrath; And oft a citizen would ask him in And sit him down beside him at his board, Yet soon his weary march would he begin As if he felt not by the food restored; I wondering asked him, why he tarried not To taste the cheer they had so freely given; And why the sheltering roof he had forgot? He nothing said; but pointed up to heaven;â And then I knew the food they gave away, And home they offered were but for a day. Poem No. 748; early 1840? The Idler I idle stand that I may find employ, Such as my Master when He comes will give; I cannot find in mine own work my joy, But wait, although in waiting I must live; My body shall not turn which way it will, But stand till I the appointed road can find, And journeying so his messages fulfill, And do at every step the work designed. Enough for me, still day by day to wait Till Thou who form'st me find'st me too a task; A cripple lying at the rich man's gate, Content for the few crumbs I get to ask; A laborer but in heart, while bound my hands Hang idly down still waiting thy commands. Poem No. 239; late 1838âearly 1840 The Lost The fairest day that ever yet has shone, Will be when thou the day within shalt see; The fairest rose that ever yet has blown, When thou the flower thou lookest on shalt be. But thou art far away among Time's toys; Thyself the day thou lookest for in them, Thyself the flower that now thine eye enjoys, But wilted now thou hang'st upon thy stem. The bird thou hearest on the budding tree, Thou hast made sing with thy forgotten voice; But when it swells again to melody, The song is thine in which thou wilt rejoice; And thou new risen 'midst these wonders live, That now to them dost all thy substance give. Poem No. 495; late 1838-early 1840 The Narrow Way Where this one dwells and that, thou know'st it well, Each earthly neighbor and each earthly friend; But He who calls thee has no place to dwell, And canst thou then thine all unto Him lend? Canst thou a stranger be, where now well known; Where now thou oftenest go'st, go nevermore, But walk the world thenceforth thy way alone, Broadening the path but little worn before? Then may'st thou find me, when thou 't faint and weak, And the strait road seems narrower still to grow; For I will words of comfort to thee speak, And onward with thee to my home I'll go, Where thou shalt find a rest in labor sweet, No friend and yet a friend in all to greet. Poem No. 807; late 1838-early 1840 The True Light The morning's brightness cannot make thee glad, If thou art not more bright than it within; And nought of evening's peace hast thou e'er had, If evening first did not with thee begin. Full many a sun I saw first set and rise, Before my day had found a rising too; And I with Nature learned to harmonize, And to her times and seasons made me true. How fair that new May morning when I rose Companion of the sun for all the day; O'er every hill and field where now he goes, With him to pass, nor fear again to stray; But 'neath the full-orbed moon's reflected light Still onward keep my way till latest night. Poem No. 531; late 1838-early 1840 The Invitation Stay where thou art, thou need'st not further go, The flower with me is pleading at thy feet; The clouds, the silken clouds, above me flow, And fresh the breezes come thy cheek to greet. Why hasten on;âhast thou a fairer home? Has God more richly blest the world than here, That thou in haste would'st from thy country roam, Favored by every month that fills the year? Sweet showers shall on thee here, as there, descend; The sun salute thy morn and gild thy eve: Come, tarry here, for Nature is thy friend, And we an arbor for ourselves will weave; And many a pilgrim, journeying on as thou, Will grateful bless its shade, and list the wind-struck bough. Poem No. 433; late 1838-early 1840 The Sick Where thou hast been once well received, There thou shouldst often go again; That so, of every want relieved, Joy may find birth in buried pain. I knew one, but his heart was weak, Who went when keen was sorrow's smart; And well a moment, would not seek The hand that touched with healing art; I knew another; he was wise; Nor felt he of his wounds made strong, Till he could from his couch arise, And walk with him who cured along: Which art thou, friend? for oft the first Will call the better one the worst. Poem No. 808; late 1838-early 1840 The Flesh The Flesh bears early fruit; most eat of it, And many die who eat e'en that too soon; They fade like flowers the morning's sunbeam lit, But wilted fall before the heat of noon; Behold the friends and children born to be But blossoms overtaken by the frost; Put forth ere in the limbs the sap ran free, Or spring gave signs that winter's strength was lost; See houses fires and creeping age consume, And fields the weed and thistle boast as theirs; These, blazing up, the night's dark face illume, And those, the garden whence they reap but tares. Alas! how soon have vanished those the eye Looked fondly on; green fields and houses high! Poem No. 497; late 1838-early 1840 Decay Disease that on thy body feeds Is but decay beneath the ground, That slowly eats the buried seeds, That green above they may be found. Thou canst not live, save the low earth Be quickened by the sun and rain, To give thee everlasting birth, And change the form thou wouldst retain. Wouldst thou rejoice with budding stem, When spring anew uncurls the leaf,â When summer comes gain strength like them, And laden be with autumn's sheaf: Then with them bear that slow decay; It visits you with mouldering grain; And thou shalt spring anew as they To die and find thy life again. Poem No. 100; late 1838-early 1840 The New Sea I heard the sound of the wild, heaving sea, Its billows had rolled on unheard before, For to some vainly-fancied thing I had given The name, that gentile nations worship as A God. But now I heard without deceit Surges that ever roll; the deep below Answering with awful voice the deep above! The sea was past; the waters met, And o'er the heads of Pharaoh's hosts; I turned,â And saw the proud careering waves ride as Reined steeds under some mighty conquerors Driven on. It was a day when the battle Had been given unto God's chosen sons; And I rejoiced as rose its glorious sun Looking o'er land and sea, the inheritance Of man new-blessed. And they who beneath its waves And on its bed as on the dry land walked, God led, stood on the other bank; and shouts Louder than from the sea rose up to heaven. Poem No. 238; late 1838-early 1840 The Baker's Island Light Near on Salem's rocky shore Stands the Baker's Island Light, Sending o'er the white sea's roar Rays that light the darkest night. Home-bound vessels on their way, 'Scaped the dangers of the deep, Hail with joy its far-seen ray As to land their course they keep. On to midnight's hour it shines, On from midnight's hour till morn; Till the east with golden lines Marks the day's bright offspring born. Pale its light before the dawn Tells a brighter beacon near, And the sailor's eyes withdrawn To their port in safety steer. Poem No. 351; c. 21 August 1840 The Gifts of God The light that fills thy house at morn Thou canst not for thyself retain; But all who with thee here are born It bids to share an equal gain. The wind that blows thy ship along Her swelling sails cannot confine; Alike to all the gales belong, Nor canst thou claim a breath as thine. The earth, the green out-spreading earth; Why hast thou fenced it off from me? Hadst thou than I a nobler birth, Who callest thine a gift so free. The wave, the blue encircling wave; No chains can bind, no fetters hold! Its thunders tell of Him who gave What none can ever buy for gold. Poem No. 521; c. 2 October 1840 The Sepulchre Of The Books 'Tis a high stone pile It will hold them all; The books of the great and the books of the small, They gather to their place of rest, From the north and the south, and the east and the west. Come gather them in, Come gather them in, They cannot repent of their evil &amp; sin The good &amp; the bad it will hold them all, They will sleep on forever at rest in Gore Hall. The place of the Skulls! The place of the Dead! The dim light will show them as through it we tread! See here these huge columns! these heavy stones! 'Tis the tomb of the Books, 'tis the high place of Bones! The hemlock and pine Around it here wave, They will sleep on in silence they have found here a grave; Look here on each side what a high massy wall! They will sleep on forever at rest in Gore Hall. All silent! all silent They rest in the pile, No more to bewilder, no more to beguile; In silence unbroken their sepulchre be, No light, save the candle, their resting place see. Poem No. 721; c. January 1841 The Robin's Song The robin has begun his early song, His twitterings on the leafless locust bough; From hour to hour his notes are loud and long, Unheard since autumn's by-gone days till now. Yet he is there; and calling to his mate; âThe cot is all unbuilded for our youngâ; At early morn, and into evening late, By each to each from tree to tree is sung;â âThe cot is all unbuilded for our young, The last year's nest will not our offspring hold; 'Tis time for them a new one was begun, Where winter's left the relics of the old.â âBring willow twigs, and sticks from out the grove, And bring the mire, the wet mire from the stream; These one by one together shall be wove, And that shall fill and plaster every seam.â âThe soft, soft leaves, and shreds shall line, within, The cradle of our tender, infant brood; Come, hasten love! 'tis time that we begin, For now the fields and air all promise food.â Thus morn and eve he sings his twittering song, High up upon the slow-leaved locust tree; And soon their cot new-builded, large and strong, And safe from harm, upon its top will be. Poem No. 553; c. 6 April 1841 The Wounded Pigeon And thou wast out on yesternight When the wind blew so high a gale, And snow and darkness gathered might Joined with its loud and angry wail! When rose the storm to smite each roof, And the tree's lofty pride lay low; And, swift as shuttles through the woof, To drive the tall ships to and fro; Thee too, a wanderer from some cot, Driven up and downward in its whirl, Amid the mightier things it wrought, Against our porch it came to hurl. Poor dove! the door man enters oft Opened not to thee in thy distress, Thou heardst no welcome voices soft Thou sawest no hands outstretched to bless. Not so, she who from the waters back Returning sought the wandering ark, When yet her foot had left no track, Was welcomed to the tossing bark. But here thy wounds unheeded flowed, Nor heard thy moans, nor tapping bill; Unknown thy pangs, till morning glowed, And seen thy blood upon the sill. Perhaps thy wounds by this are healed, And thou hast forgot the unsheltered place; But I were to instruction steeled Should I forget thy suffering's trace. Full oft our eyes are closed in sleep Too deep to wake at misery's call, Full oft a feeble watch we keep When, without aid, the weak must fall. Lord! strengthen me the hour to heed That brings the sufferer to my door, That I may to his succour speed, Ere yet the time Thou giv'st be o'er. Poem No. 49; 26 October 1841 The Swift Men tell how many blossoms will appear On every tree they plant &amp; hope to thrive How many kernels fill the yellow ear How many bees shall swarm in every hive When Spring's but come, 'tis Autumn here with them And Summers but of Winter's cold can tell; And when they see the fruit on laden stem With them its early buds begin to swell 'Tis all too slow, fair nature's gentle growth; Their hopes are ripe, when hers but bud &amp; bloom; And they accuse her equal paceâof sloth, And cast on her the shadow of their gloom. But she, kind Mother of her children all, With voice of dove-like mildness gently chides âI care for e'en the humble sparrow's fall Alike with yon bright orb that o'er thee glides!â Poem No. 329; 1841â42? The World 'Tis all a great show, The world that we're in, None can tell when 'twas finished, None saw it begin; Men wander and gaze through Its courts and its halls, Like children whose love is The picture-hung walls. There are flowers in the meadow, There are clouds in the sky, Songs pour from the wood-land, The waters glide by; Too many, too many For eye or for ear, The sights that we see, And the sounds that we hear. A weight as of slumber Comes down on the mind, So swift is Life's train To its objects we're blind; I myself am but one In the fleet-gliding show, Like others I walk But know not where I go. One saint to another I heard say âHow long?â I listened, but nought more I heard of his song; The shadows are walking Through city and plain, How long shall the night And its shadow remain! How long and shall shine In this glimmer of things The Light of which prophet In prophecy sings; And the gates of that city Be open, whose sun No more to the west Its circuit shall run! Poem No. 723; c. 1 April 1842 The Evening Choir The organ smites the ear with solemn notes In the dark pines withdrawn, whose shadows fall Motionless on the moonlit path which leads To the house of God, within whose porch I stand. Behold the stars and larger constellations Of the north hemisphere; glitter more bright Their ranks, and more harmonious they seem, As from within swells out the holy song. The pillars tremble with the waves of sound! There is in these deep tones a power to abide Within us; when the hand is mouldered Of him who sweeps its keys, and silent too Her voice, who with the organ chants so sweet, We shall hear echoes of a former strain, Soft soul-like airs coming we know not whence. I would that to the noisy throng below, Which paces restless through the glimmering street, Might reach this anthem with its cadence soft, And its loud rising blasts. Men's ears are closed, And shut their eyes, when from on high the angels Listen well pleased, and nearer draw to the earth. Yet here the blind man comes, the only constant Listener. In the dim-lighted Church, within Some pew's recess, retired he sits, with face Upturned as if he saw, as well as heard, And music was to him another sense: Some thoughtless at the gate a moment stand, Whom a chance-wandering melody detains, And then, forgetful, mingle with the tide That bears them on; perchance to wonder whence It came, or dream from a diviner sphere 'T was heard. Tomorrow is the Sabbath-time; Refreshed by sleep this tired multitude, Which now by all ways rushes through the city, Each hurrying to and fro with thoughts of gain, And harried with the business of the world, Men with children mixed clamorous and rude, Shall, all at once, quit their accustomed streets, And to the temples turn with sober pace, And decent dress composed for prayer and praise. Yon gate, that now is shut upon the crowd, Shall open to the worshippers; by paths Where not a foot's now heard, up these high steps Come arm in arm the mother, father, child, Brother, and sister, servants and the stranger Tarrying with them, and the stated priest Who ministers in holy things. Peace be On this House, on its courts! May the high hymn Of praise, that now is sung preparative, Quiet the rough waves that loud are breaking At its base, and threatening its high walls. I would not, when my heart is bitter grown, And my thoughts turned against the multitude, War with their earthly temple; mar its stones; Or, with both pillars in my grasp, shake down The mighty ruin on their heads. With this I war not, nor wrestle with the earthly man. I war with the spiritual temple raised By pride, whose top is in the heavens, though built On the earth; whose site and hydra-headed power Is everywhere;âwith Principalities, And them who rule the darkness of this world, The Spirits of wickedness that highest stand. 'Gainst this and these I fight; nor I alone, But those bright stars I see that gather round Nightly this sacred spot. Nor will they lay Their glittering armor by, till from heaven's height Is cast Satan with all his host headlong! Falling from sphere to sphere, from earth to earth Forever;âand God's will is done. Poem No. 537; spring-summer 1842 The Cold Spring In North Salem Thou small, yet ever-bubbling spring Hid by low hillocks round, And oaks whose stretching branches fling Their shadows on the ground; I stoop upon thy stony brim To taste thy waters sweet, For I am weary and worn of limb, And joy thy sight to meet. I would not from thy free bowl scare The birds from the boughs above, But learn with them this fount to share As the gift of a Father's love. Thou hast joy in this thy wilderness, In thy still yet constant flow; Such as one from pure and perfect bliss Alone with thee can know. Oh, seldom may the Sea, that near Sends up its frequent tide, Mix with thy cooling waters clear And in thy breast abide! And if perchance a lengthened wave Should o'er thy margin swell, Quick may thy bubbling freshness save And the salt brine repel. Poem No. 668â697; October-November 1842 Lines on Reading the Death of Rev. Henry Ware, Jr. Though thou art dead and gone from mortal sight, Faith will not let thee go, but follows on; It sees thee even here beyond the grave, That farthest limit to the eye of sense! Blessed is he who puts his trust in him Who came into, and left this earthly sphere, Yet without sin. Such shall not stay within The darksome tomb, companion of the dead, But rise in incorruption with his Lord. I thought not that so soon thou wouldst depart! It seems but yesterday, and strong thy mind And vigorous in man's service;âbut the day And hour that calls the faithful servant home Into his Master's joy we cannot know. Thou tendest now those âother sheepâ which he Has gone to bring. Many have heard thy voice And known it here, and many learned from thee The way of peace. Thy words and works shall be Thy praise, and grateful hearts whom thou hast left To mourn. How many of the great and good Within this fleeting year have passed away! Alas! it pains me but to tell them o'er. Names that the world has honored and revered, And some as worthy that the world ne'er knew. Much have we cause to mourn, whose lights yet burn, For so much Genius, Wisdom, Goodness gone. But let us not say âgone;â but see those still Whom we have lost, in Heaven, their proper home. Poem No. 709; c. 30 September 1843 Jonathan Huntington Bright I sit within the room where thou once sat, When half my age, a curly headed boy; And live beneath the roof where thou once lived, And spent life's early hours in peace and joy. Here by the cheerful hearth and plenteous board, Thou hast known a father's care, a mother's love; Here was thy soul trained up to know its God, And taught to prize the Wisdom from above. And here the School, where many a livelong day Thou hast pondered o'er the lesson hard and long; And here the fields, the river, and the hills That first inspired thee with the love of song. Methinks I see thee with thy many mates Upon yon sandy bank in healthful play, Or bathing in the river's cooling tide, Or hastening homeward at the close of day. Methinks I see thee in the pastures wild, Seeking the ripening berries far and near; Breaking through bushy swamps, or on the hill; Almost thy voice at times I seem to hear; But thou are dead! Fair Salem's earliest bard! Scarce half accomplished was man's life by thee! Where rolls the Mississippi's mighty flood The stranger's eye thy resting place can see! Though known to few thy name, and few thy song, Of all that now within thy city dwell; Like thee, a âTravellerâ A native of Salem. He was for several years a writer for the public journals and literary magazines under the signature of âViator.â through earth's passing scenes, Fain would I of thy worth and wanderings tell. Fain would I plant with laurel famed thy grave, Where thou reposest from life's toilsome way; Whose branches ever green, and towering head Should mark thy rest to those who distant stray: Still would I love as classic ground the spot, Where passed in joy thy childhood's early hour; The quiet roof, the field, the hill, the stream Will from thy memory now have double power. Poem No. 270; c. 19 January 1844 God's Host There is an order in our daily life, Like that the Holy Angels constant keep; And though its outward form seem but a strife, There dwells within a calm as the ocean's deep. The forms that meet you in the house and street Brushing with their rough coats your shining dress, Did they in their own robes and features greet Would seem like angels that the world possess: And thou like Jacob when from Galeed's heap He journeyed on unto the land of Seir, And sware with Laban vows of peace to keep, By Abraham's God and by his father's Fear; Wouldst cry aloud in dread and wonder lost, âThis is the House of God! and these I see God's host!â Poem No. 617; c. 26 March 1844 The Worm I saw a worm, with many a fold, It spun itself a silken tomb; And there in winter-time enrolled, It heeded not the cold or gloom. The traces of a dry, dead leaf Were left in lines upon its cone; The record of its history brief, A spring and summer come and gone. Within a small, snug nook it lay, Nor rain nor snow could reach it there; Nor wind was felt in gusty day, Nor biting cold of frosty air. But spring returned; its mild, warm breath Was felt within the sleeper's cell; And waking from its trance of death, I saw it crawl from out its shell. And starting where they lay beneath, Were eyelet wings spread one by one; Each perfected as from a sheath, And shining in the morning sun. Slow and with pain it first moved on, And of the dust still seemed to be; An hour passed by; the worm was gone;â It soared on golden pinions free! Poem No. 257a; spring 1845 The White Dove And The Snow The quickly melting snow ran through the street, The busy street, where man so often treads Thinking on earthly things, careworn and sad; And there a milk-white dove drank eagerly, As if it blessed the heaven-descended stream. Gazing, I thought of Purity and Faith; How unto these the Lord giveth to drink, E'en on the crowded city's dusty ways, Of those clear streams which from His golden throne Forever flow! Why thoughtless pass we by Those crystal streams, that ever downward flow To cool our thirsty, feverish spirits In their daily toil, and make us think of Him? The world's loud, turbid flood will soon run dry, And we be left without one cooling draught. Poem No. 547; 16 March 1846 The Latter Rain The latter rain,âit falls in anxious haste Upon the sun-dried fields and branches bare, Loosening with searching drops the rigid waste, As if it would each root's lost strength repair; But not a blade grows green as in the spring, No swelling twig puts forth its thickening leaves, No busy birds, as then, are heard to sing, Building upon the boughs or 'neath the eaves; The rain falls still,âyet Nature heeds it not, She lifeless lies, as lies upon the bier The corse that soon within the ground must rot, Nor knows that on it falls the scalding tear; Yet she tho' dead, like man, shall live again, And bless with smiles and songs the latter rain. Poem No. 518a; c. 4 April 1846 Moses In Infancy How! canst thou see the basket, wherein lay The infant Moses, by the river's side; And her, who stood and watched it on the tide; Will Time bring back to thee that early day? And canst thou to the distant Nile be near, Where lived that mother, tossed with hope and fear, Yet more than was her infant by the wave? No: Time will not his dark domain unbar, Himself he cannot from oblivion save; Nor canst thou make come nearer what is far;â But thou hast human sympathies to feel What eye, nor ear, nor sense can e'er reveal; Hope too is thine, that past the ocean sails, And Memory, that over Time himself prevails! Poem No. 182; c. 9 May 1846 Moses at the Bush 'Twas while the bush was burning, Moses saw The Present God! and heard His voice, I AM! The God of Jacob, and of Abraham Spake, in the wild, to him who gave the Law; Quick as he heard he hid his face in awe! Around him flared the red light on the rocks, And downward shone upon his sleeping flocks. He who from Pharaoh hasted to withdraw, Leaving his palaces, and piles of art Lit with aye-burning lamps, false idols' seat; Though not, when in the wilderness he fed His father's flocks, the great I AM to meet; From human homes, and man's known ways apart, Where burned the bush on Horeb's rocky head! Poem No. 750; c. 30 May 1846 Moses As Leader Of Israel 'Twas not by strength of man, that Moses sought To guide his people to their promised rest; Nor his own wisdom, that through deserts brought, And in a land of plenty made them blest; Though he was learned in all the hidden lore That Aegypt knew, mighty in word and deed; 'Twas not, by these, he broke their fetters sore, And Israel's tribes from Pharaoh's bondage freed. âIf Thou wilt not go with us,â was his prayer Unto the Lord of Hosts, âlet us not go Up to the land, which Thou, before, did'st swear To give unto our fathers. Thus shall know All men, that Thou hast chosen us to be A people called and holy unto Thee.â Poem No. 749; c. 4 July 1846 The New Jerusalem There are towers; where they are, In the topmost sky; Thou from here hast never seen, With thy clouded eye. There are houses, temples there, In that world of bliss; Yet thou canst not see them here, From a place like this. There I see the Son of Man, Of that world the light; Seen by all; their sun by day, And their moon by night. There are beings, they who went From thy presence here; From their mansions looking down On thine earthly sphere. Cherubs there, and white-robed men, Angels born to love; High! how high their golden home! Dwelling there above. Poem No. 609; c. 15 August 1846 The Autumn Flowers Though so fair, how soon they perish, Few the days, the hours they stay! Let us then their beauty cherish, That so soon must pass away. Winter waits with icy fingers Soon to snatch them for his own; But the Summer's day still lingers, Though its months are past and gone. Every morn I look to see them Fallen, shrivelled by the frost; But each morn again restores me, What at evening I had lost. Trees and vines may change their verdure Bright with every beauteous hue; Yet their tints, how fair soever, Shall not take my love from you. They will see another season, Spring will clothe them with its green; But for you no spring returneth, You will here no more be seen! They, with the returning Autumn, Bright, as now, will reappear; And renew their fading glories Still for many a coming year. But within my soul your beauty Shall, unfading, ever bloom; There no frosts can blight, or wither, There no night conceal with gloom. Every tint shall memory heighten, Seen and loved in these short hours; And, while memory's self continues, Still shall bloom the Autumn Flowers. Poem No. 708; October 1846 The Death Of Man All Nature dies! wide over hill and plain, The forests brown and withered meet the eye; The flowers are gone, the birds will not remain, The grass, so green of late, is pale and dry. But what is Nature's death, though, far and wide Thou see'st the emblems of her sure decay, To Man's; to whom, in soul, thou art allied; And who but now, unnoticed, passed away! Daily he passes; in the lowly shed, In the high palace, 'neath the open sky; No world-wide symbols mark that He is dead, No gorgeous splendor draws thy wondering eye; Yet passed there from thee all that Heaven could give, And more than could within all Nature live! Poem No. 33; c. 12 December 1846 As ye sow, so shall ye reap. The bud will soon become a flower, The flower become a seed; Then seize, O youth, the present hour,â Of that thou hast most need. Do thy best always,âdo it now,â For in the present time, As in the furrows of a plough, Fall seeds of good or crime. The sun and rain will ripen fast Each seed that thou hast sown; And every act and word at last By its own fruit be known. And soon the harvest of thy toil Rejoicing thou shalt reap; Or o'er thy wild, neglected soil Go forth in shame to weep. Poem No. 473; 1846 God Not Afar Off Father! Thy wonders do not singly stand, Nor far removed where feet have seldom strayed; Around us ever lies the enchanted land, In marvels rich to Thine own sons displayed. In finding Thee are all things round us found! In losing Thee are all things lost beside! Ears have we, but in vain sweet voices sound, And to our eyes the vision is denied. Open our eyes that we that world may see! Open our ears that we Thy voice may hear! And in the spirit-land may ever be, And feel Thy presence with us always near; No more to wander 'mid the things of time, No more to suffer death or earthly change; But with the Christian's joy and faith sublime, Through all Thy vast, eternal scenes to range. Poem No. 126a; 1846 The Indian's Retort The white man's soul, it thirsts for gain, He makes himself the slave of gold! The Indian's free and boundless lands, Once all his own, are bought and sold. An Indian to the forest went, To strip the birch for his canoe; His father's father's was the wood, Before the White his country knew. A weary journey he must take Along a hot, and dusty road; And to his distant wigwam bring, Upon his back, the heavy load. Long searched he for a fitting tree, Where once they easy were to find; The white man's axe had laid them low, The white man's fire left few behind. At length 'twas found; he stripped its bark, He raised his bundle from the ground; A white man stood beside him there, And on the Indian sternly frowned. âThou steal'st!â âThou art a thief!â he cried;â The Indian threw his bundle down, And proudly answered; as he turned To meet the white man's angry frown; âGod made the woods, and to his sons, The Indians, gave them long ago; The Indian never was a thief, I speak the truth, as thou dost know.â âThe White man came! he stole the woods, The hills, the streams, the fields, the game; The Indian never was a thief! The white man steals, his is the name!â Poem No. 593; c. 9 January 1847 The Widow A greater tribute than the Temple's height, Its solid walls, and sounding minstrelsy, And all that there the senses vain delight, Is that lone widow's worship, Lord, to Thee. In her ill-furnished chamber there, alone, She opes the Book, which Thou hast given to all; And, on her knees, before thy gracious throne, For light, and strength, in this her need, doth call. And she shall find them; what the boasting pride Of minster-service promised her in vain; Though late she seeks, she shall not be denied, She, through thy Son, Eternal Life shall gain; When left by crowds, Thou, Father, still art near, And dost delight the lonely one to hear. Poem No. 8; c. March 1847 Impatience Thou chid'st the wind, and snow, and sleet, and ice; That still delay the Spring, when Spring is near. Thou see'st the grass as if already green, And scent'st the flowers, and hear'st the song of birds. Then why this disappointment of my hopes, You ask? What! would you have the year come forth To fail, and die? This wind, and snow, and ice, This second winter was not made in vain. 'Twas sent to retard and check the vital powers, That else, with fatal haste, might swell the grain, And cause the fruitful trees too soon to bloom. O'ertook by sudden frosts, and icy blasts, Nature in all her glow of life would droop, And famished millions perish! Scorn not slow Nature's work; chide not her ways, For they are ordered, everywhere, aright; But from her wisdom learn thou to be wise. There is a Providence in all we see, Which man should ever study and adore. Poem No. 667; c. 17 April 1847 AbdolonymusâThe Sidonian The clash of arms, which shook the Persian state, Did not disturb the peasant at his toil; In his small garden-plot more truly great, Than he who stretched his sceptre o'er its soil. He wanted naught, but what his hands supplied, Content with fruits, the bounty of his field; There would he, in old age, in peace have died; But worth and greatness could not be concealed! O'erlooked were many, who would Sidon rule, Ambitious princes, seeking kingly sway; Who, trained in arms, had learned from War's proud school, By fire and sword to win to thrones their way. The crown and purple robe to him were sent, Who peaceful lived, with poverty content. Poem No. 477; c. 31 July 1847 The Arrival The ship comes up the harbor. Every sail Is set on every mast. The sun is bright, And the blue waters 'round seem to rejoice With her that she has 'scaped all perils now, And safe returned unto her destined port. Upon the wharf are groups straining their eyes To tell her signal, and conjecturing Her name. Some aided by the glass pronounce More surely. The aged seamen know her By her spars. Boats put out to welcome her. She's past the Island Light, past yonder head, And soon she will be hereâso swift she sails. To the wharf's extreme a boy comes running. He listens to the sounds borne on the breeze. âThat is my father's voice,â he cries o'erjoyed, Yet half in doubt as though it might not be. And then again, âThat is my father's voice!â Nearer the vessel comes. He sees him now, And points him out there leaning o'er the side. He's all beside himself with hope and joy. The vessel nears the wharf. The captain speaks, And swift the sailors fly to every rope. The yards are dropt, the sails are quickly furled, And motionless the noble vessel lies Beside the pier. Joyous greetings follow. But most glad of all the boy. Ere the ship Had touched the wharf, he from another's side Had gained her deck, and seized his father's hand. Poem No. 559; 5 Aprilâ23 October 1847 The Soul's Preparation For Adversity How stript and bare is every bush and tree Of all the pride of summer, and of spring; Each of its vain encumbrance shaken free, While winter's blasts through all their branches ring! So, when Thou would'st thy children should prepare To meet adversity, and pain, and death; To suffer all things, every danger dare; Thou scatterest, Father, with the tempest's breath, All that they cling to in their hour of pride, All that the world calls greatness, glory, power; That they in Thee alone may then confide, And find their proper strength; in that lone hour, When this world's glory burdens, or is gone; And they must look to Thee, and Thee alone. Poem No. 203; c. 4 December 1847 Change In The Seasons Has Nature a new sympathy with man, That, in this northern clime, the pansies bloom To deck the opening year with summer flowers? In mid December, still the fields were green. On my walk I found the dandelion Full blown, and bright as when it opes in Spring, And sprinkles all the mead with yellow gold. The apple blossoms, early shrubs have leaves, And Spring seems pressing on in Winter's stead! These fair signs we see are not deceptive. Experience has shown from year to year, That Winter grows more mild. Rivers that once Were frozen, so that heavy wagons crost Secure as on a bridge, now freeze no more; And countries, that were buried deep with snow, Through all the year, and uninhabited, Now yield the olive, and the purple grape. Astronomers once thought the equator's plane Approached the ecliptic's, in the lapse of time; And, should they coincide, perpetual Spring Would come. Changes as great, Geology Has proved the earth to have seen. That tropic Plants, and animals have lived, and flourished, here In our Northern clime. That once the Mammouth Roamed Siberia's plains, and in the frozen North abundant pasturage found. Here forests Grew of other leaf, and fruits; here other Flowers. Pleased with the thought my fancy sees The tropic's vegetation rise around! Where now the spreading oak, the palm upsprings; The apple for the olive is exchanged; The golden orange through the dark leaves glows, Where now the hardy pine alone will live. For scraggy briar, the fragrant myrtle By the roadside blooms. Delicate flowers, That household care alone can now make live, Bloom wild throughout the year; fearing no blast, Or cruel frost to nip their tender leaves. Thus over all the earth, from month to month, Bland gales shall blow, and birds continual sing; No sudden tempest lash the sea to foam, Nor shall the earth with sudden tremor shake. All nature then will be at peace, to which E'en now by slow degrees she tends. Alas! When Nature thus improves upon herself, By God's decree, that man should retrograde; Unfit himself for that new earth and sky, Which with revolving seasons hastens on. Now fair his promise, and he seems to tend Like nature to a new-born, heavenly Spring Of endless happiness, and peace, and love; But soon his passions like a whirlwind rise, Fierce hate and wrath hide the mild-beaming sun, And snatch the pleasing prospect from our view, And nought is left but hope to light our path. Poem No. 156; January 1848 The Just Shall Live by Faith âThe just shall live by faithâ the Prophet cried, When, sent in judgment on his native land, He saw the fierce Chaldeans spreading wide, And Israel's hosts too feeble to withstand; âThe just shall live by faith,â the Apostle said, When Christ delayed his coming on the earth; And, with these words, his fainting followers staid, And hope within them had a second birth. âThe just shall live by faithâ the Reformer's word, That roused the Church, when sunk in sin and lust, To turn again unto the Living Lord, And shake her shining garments from the dust; Oh may we heed it, when our Lord delays, And tarries long, that He may prove our ways! Poem No. 517; c. 26 February 1848 Salem Boast not, my native spot, thy sons were first To shed their blood in Freedom's noble cause; Nor glory when thou hear'st the tale rehearst, Though all the world should greet thee with applause. Another day has come, another age, And rights by blood and strife no more are won; Awake! and write thee on a holier page, Nor boast with warriors what thy sword has done. See the answer of the citizens of Salem to Gov. Gage in 1774, when he proposed to remove the General Court to that place; Boston being a closed port. Scorn, as thou ever hast, to build thy walls Upon a suffering neighbor's hapless lot; Heed Peace, Humanity, and Justice's calls; And, when in coming ages are forgot The strife of war and every blood-stained field, Thy Name alone undying fame shall yield! Poem No. 72; 25 March 1848 Spring in the Soul The bough which long has borne the winter's blast, Enclosed with ice, or heavy with the snow; Does, when its cold and stormy months are past, The springing leaves and bursting blossoms show. So ye, on whom the world's cold breath has blown, While here you suffer for your Master's name; The kindness of the Father soon shall own, And, in the fruit you bear, His love proclaim. Its storms are sent by the same Father's love, Who, with the seasons, marks the varied year, That you may thus your full obedience prove;â Then courage take, and calm each rising fear; Endure! For Spring will quickly come again, Come in your hearts, as now on hill and plain. Poem No. 469â573; March 1848 Nature's Invitation Pine not, my child, to distant lands to go; The flower with me is pleading at thy feet, The clouds delaying through the azure flow, And soft the breezes come thy cheek to greet. Why hasten on, hast thou a fairer home? Has God more richly blessed the world than here, That thou in haste wouldst from thy country roam, Favored by every month that fills the year? What though in other climes rise loftier piles, And Art with fairer colors decks her halls; No fairer there than here are Nature's smiles, No sweeter there than here her music calls; Attune thy mind, open thine inward eye, And thou wilt seek no more a distant sky. Poem No. 397; c. 27 May 1848 Christ's Compassion Matt. IX. 35â38. He saw them tasked with heavy burthens all, Bowed down and weary 'neath the heavy load; With none their faltering footsteps home to call, Or point them out the strait and narrow road; His spirit bore their burthens, as his own, He healed the sick, restored the sightless eyes; He heard the mourner for a loved one moan, And bade the dead from out the grave arise! Truly on him the Spirit did descend, For he, by works divine, its influence proved; Of all our race Consoler, Guide, and Friend, By heavenly Love, divine Compassion moved; Oh, that his spirit might on us abide, And flow in healing streams on every side! Poem No. 166; c. 17 June 1848 Hymn Nevertheless, when the Son of Man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? Luke XVIII: 8. Alas, that faith is wanting now, As when the Savior came of old; The wreaths still deck the warrior's brow, And love in Christians' hearts grows cold. A faith in better things is dead, Than what the world before has seen; Men still in their own ways will tread, And ask no more, than what has been. They trust in carnal weapons still, The warrior's spear, the warrior's sword, And deeds of blood that history fill, And ask, âWhere is the coming Lord?â They want a deeper faith in man, That looks beneath the outward show Of difference in wealth, or clan, And man in every form doth know. A deeper faith in God they need, That they in him can all things do; A faith from every weakness freed, And finding still his promise true. Lord! let us not with those appear, Who faithless shall thy Coming see; But may we view that Coming near, And, in thy likeness, come with thee. Poem No. 29; c. 19 August 1848 The Man of Science A man, whom Science had made wise, Above the multitude around; Till he could tread the starry skies, As other mortals tread the ground; Conceived that he could grasp the thought, How Nature into being sprang; When worlds were called from empty naught, And morning's stars together sang! That he the mystery could tell, How man himself at first began; And trace from microscopic cell, Through lower forms, the noblest, Man! At last he rose to such a height, That even human feeling fled; And he could look without affright, On what would fill the world with dread;â In abstract musing, he could see The earth return to naught again; And man and Nature cease to be, Yet heave no sigh, and feel no pain! But once, in midnight's solemn hour, His natural feelings all awoke; And gifted with diviner power, Thus to his trembling spirit spoke. âWhere wast thou, when the world was made?â âWhere wilt thou be, when it shall end?â He heard, and he was sore afraid, Nor would his voice an answer lend. Unwonted thoughts and feelings thronged His awe-struck soul, and it possessed; For his own nature he had wronged, And all his nobler wants suppressed. That which before unreal seemed, And but a distant, shadowy thought, When he, in abstruse studies dreamed; Was to his soul all real brought. He sympathized with Nature's fate, Nor saw unfeeling her decay; Beheld far back her ancient date, And joyed to see her earliest day. Nor felt for worlds' vast change alone, But for the little short-lived flower; Whose beauteous morn is scarcely known, Before it sees its evening hour. And though as earnest still to scan The wonders of creation o'er; He was a wiser, better man, And mingled Love with Science' lore. Poem No. 12; c. 21 October 1848 The Congress Of Peace At Brussels From out the midst of Europe in alarms, A voice is heard persuading men to peace; A voice whose power with heavenly music charms, And bids the tumult of the world to cease. The nations, blessed with thirty years repose, Seemed on the borders of the promised land; The land that war's fierce conflicts never knows, Where all who live are one united band. And even now they stand on Jordan's stream; But unbelief still sways the human mind; And all the glorious prospect seems a dream, For to its near approach their souls are blind. Not by the sword, or violence shall rights, Long lost to nations, be at once regained; Not by the prowess shown in deadly fights, Shall Freedom, once achieved, be still maintained. God of one blood has all the nations made To dwell, in peace, together on the earth; That none should be of others' power afraid, And none should boast them of a nobler birth. We are all One. Boast not of rights, if won By conquering hosts upon the gory plain; But mourn for what thine own right hand hath done, Nor think thy brother's blood thy Country's gain. Humanity laments, and still will weep Her slaughtered sons of every age, and clime; And hourly does her fasts and vigils keep For millions perished since the birth of time! And shall she never from the dust arise, And put her robe of fleecy whiteness on; And dry her swoln, and ever-flowing eyes For wrongs, that man his brother man has done? Yes: for though passing clouds may dim her sight, They shall not long prevent the approaching day; Already are the hill-tops glad with light, And man's proud tyrants starting with dismay. Soon shall she see her children dwell in peace On all the earth, of every name and clime; Their friendly intercourse of love increase, Unfettered by the bonds of space and time! A deep abiding joy her soul shall fill, Beholding thus her countless children blest; Secure from rude alarms, from every ill, And entering here on their eternal rest! Poem No. 141; 24 November 1848 'Tis A Great Thing to Live 'Tis a great thing to live. Not small the task Our Heavenly Father gives us here below; And we have need continually to ask, That light, and strength may through our being flow. Not on the trifles of the passing hour, With those who squander life, fix thou thy mind; (For these may rob thy spirit of a power Which was for greater, nobler things designed;) But on some mighty work, some worthy plan, Requiring e'en an angel's strength to do; For scarce below the angel is the man, And both may, here, one great design pursue; The same on earth, the same in heaven above, A holy ministry of peace and love. Poem No. 720; 30 December 1848 The Indian's Petition The Indian calls! Grant him a place of rest, From wrong, and violence forever free; Grant him a portion of the boundless West, Where he may dwell, and learn to live like thee. There let him learn to till the fruitful soil, Subdue his passions fierce by reason's sway; And find how vast the gains of patient toil, And all his nobler energies display. There let him learn it was not all a dream, His fathers taught him of the Indian's heaven; That there, beyond the mighty western stream, That home of rest may yet to him be given; Where he shall know His love, who died for all, And on his Heavenly Father learn to call. Poem No. 515; 23 March 1849 The Struggle A mighty struggle in the world goes on, A struggle, not for wealth, or Time's vain toys; But one, in which the crown of Life is won, And man inherits here eternal joys! Not those who slumber, or who trifle here, Can win the prize, which crowns that mighty strife; But they, whom active love doth onward cheer To fill with noble deeds their fleeting life;â Who oft through suffering, oft through shades of death Are called to pass, that they their crowns may win; Oft only victors, with their dying breath, Against the world-destroying power of Sin; Which still disputes Christ's triumph on the earth, And claims, as hers, each soul of heavenly birth. Poem No. 13; June 1849 The Things Before I would not tarry, Look! the things before Call me along my path, with beckoning love; The things I gain wear not the hues they wore, For brighter glories now my spirit move. Still on; I seek the peace my master sought, The world cannot disturb his joy within; It is not with its gold and silver bought, They give not victory over death and sin. Awake, ye sensual, from your sleep of shame! Shake off the slumbers of the earthly mind; For higher objects now your spirits claim, To which the soul, that slumbers here, is blind; Objects, which, like the soul itself, endure; Things that are true, and lovely, just, and pure. Poem No. 292; c. 21 July 1849 The Dying Leaf 'Tis not a natural law alone, By which the dying leaf Falls whirling, when its work is done, Unto the ground beneath. Before the rising autumn blast Commissioned was to bear The little leaf, once bound so fast, And whirl it through the air; The Lord of Life had checked the tide, Which through its fibres flowed; And, to its being, had denied The gift He once bestowed. The gift of life, mysterious thing! That form and substance gave; Which filled its tender veins in spring, And made it gladsome wave: But now, recalled, leaves hard and dry, The sport of lightest wind, The leaf, which once could storms defy, Though all their blasts combined. Poem No. 727; 25 October 1849 The New Body God careth for the smallest seed, Which falls into the ground; It springeth up a noble tree, And spreads its branches round. He careth for the feeble worm, Which spins its shroud to die; He gives it many-colored wings, And bids it soar on high. Through all the realms of God below, Through all his realms above; A differing glory still proclaims The same great Father's love. So is the rising from the dead! 'Tis not what thou hast sown; But, in the body God shall give, Will each to each be known. A mortal body here thou see'st Unto dishonor given; But that no pain, nor death shall know, A glorious house from heaven! God's various power, which cares for all, E'en for the smallest seed; And gives to each its different form, According to its need; Will for thy body, Man, provide, Which now thou see'st decay; And crown it with a glory too, Which shall not fade away. Poem No. 148; c. 29 December 1849 The Clock The slowly-moving fingers minutes find, And hours and days, and e'en the lengthening years; As much before them still as is behind, No want their circling movement ever fears. How different Man! By sudden impulse driven, Now in the distant past he seeks for rest; Now in the far-off future is his heaven; âHe never is, but always to be blest.â His morn is with his noon, his noon with night, His hand can never point to one true hour; But marks one past, or future in its flight, For o'er the present he has lost all power; Unlike the clock, whose ready tongue can all The hours, and days of Time find voice to call. Poem No. 565; c. 19 January 1850 On The Sudden Snow How beautiful the sight, This robe of spotless white, O'er nature flung! On every bush, and tree, Its pearly folds we see, In beauty hung. To bless this sacred day, And clothe in fit array, It fell from heaven; To make men think of God, And his own blest abode, The sight was given. God doth in Nature show His love, e'en here below, Each passing hour; And with his children plead, Oh, may we ever heed, And feel its power. Soon will He change the scene, And, with a sudden green, The earth surprise! Earth too his dwelling is, All that we see is his, The Good, and Wise. Poem No. 176; 24 March 1850 On the late Disgraceful Scene in Congress Fools! That when things of high import concern Their country's glory, and the human race; They will not from the times a lesson learn, But bring dishonor on their name and place. When millions stand expectant to be free, Is it the time for brawling and for strife; For men on trifles still to disagree, And waste the hour with highest duties rife? The statesman's words are few, and full of grace, The babbler's loud, and vulgar in their tone; Ever unworthy of the time and place, And now by folly, now by madness known; They fill the world with tumult, and with shame, And bring a foul reproach upon his country's name. Poem No. 129; 27 April 1850 The Funerals I sit and watch the winding way, Where, o'er the bridge, and through the grove, The sorrowing mourners, day by day, Follow the forms of those they love. In Winter's snows, and Summer's heat, When leaves spring forth, and when they fall; They follow on, with weary feet, The mournful hearse with sable pall. How many there, who mourn a friend, Such as can never be supplied; Who loved them e'en unto the end, And gladly would for them have died. Unnoticed passed they on through life, Forgotten in their humble spheres; The parent, child, the husband, wife; The early lost, the bowed with years. What though their lives, as now their death, Passed like yon quiet stream along; Unheralded by public breath, Unhonored by the poet's song? Not less their deeds, because unknown, Their daily toils, domestic care; Than such as Fame's loud trump has blown, Than such as widest glory share. Nor less their joy's calm, peaceful flow, Than theirs, whose breasts with tumults swell; Who with the pride of victory glow, Or of a nation's honors tell. Yon Harmony Grove in Salem. Grove, whose name describes their life, Should best receive their honored dust; They perished not in war's fierce strife, But died in peace, and holy trust. There oft Affection's feet shall turn, To dwell upon their memory dear; To wreath with flowers the funeral urn, Or shed the sympathetic tear. There, purified by grief, she views, (The vail withdrawn,) their blest abode; And, quickened by the sight, pursues With joyful hope her heaven-ward road. Poem No. 268; April 1850 The New Aqueduct Those old wooden logs The water has flown through, These many, many years; 'Tis time that we had new; Improvement is the cry, And we throw them useless by. Iron take their place, More permanent and sure; Through which the stream will run Abundantly, and pure; And all shall drink their fill From the sweet, unfailing rill. Through its hollow way The stream runs under ground; No eye beholds its course, No ear can catch its sound; Till it sparkles forth again, In the glad abodes of men. Like it is to deeds, Unconscious Worth doth hide; In secret silence done, Without a throb of pride; They too shall one day shine, With a radiance all divine. Patriarchs and kings Have gained their noblest fame, In peaceful works like these; And left enduring name; Tradition still can tell, Who dug old Sichem's well. Ever may it flow! Within our homes, 'twill prove An ever-during type Of Purity and Love, 'Twill give to sickness health, And raise poverty to wealth. Poem No. 657; c. 7 June 1850 The Soul's Freedom The green grass grows where'er it wills, On earth's wide-peopled floor; In valleys low, and on the hills Which look the valleys o'er. The river flows, nor feeble man Its tide directs, nor stays; But Him from whom the current ran Forever it obeys. There is no wind, which man can guide, Nor tell its certain bound; Restless the airy currents glide The earth's wide surface round. Thou shalt not mark with narrow walls Thine own vast being's scope; 'Tis farther back than memory calls, Nor bounded is by hope. Then fetter not with human creed, The symbol of an hour, The mind; which God's own Word has freed, And his own Spirit's power. The wind, the tide, the growing grass, Thy will cannot controul; Then fix no bounds, it shall not pass, To the free, living soul. Poem No. 504; c. 6 July 1850 Looking Before And After How oft by passion, or by interest led, Men see not that they purpose, till 'tis done! The string is snapt, the fatal arrow sped, And to its mark it flies unerring on. Look not before thee merely, but behind; See how thy deed, when finished, will appear; Like him who some fair temple has designed, And views complete; ere men a column rear. And see thy work, as it shall one day stand Before thy spirit's pure, unclouded sight; No longer subject to thy mortal hand, But in Eternity's unchanging light! Say, doth it then with added glory shine? Then boldly act, thy deed is all divine. Poem No. 195; c. 14 September 1850 The Succory I ask not what the learned name, Thou hast in College book This flower grows in great abundance around the Colleges, at Cambridge, Mass.; I feel thou would'st the question blame, Blue Flower! with thy bright look. I'll ask then of yon playful child, That stooped to pluck thee there; What name she gave thee, when she smiled, And placed thee in her hair. Her prattling tongue shall frame for me A name of sweeter tone, Than Science ever gave to thee, To mark thee for her own. A name a mother's lips have taught To call the way-side flower; A name with thoughts and feelings fraught Of childhood's happy hour. Still may it wake sweet child, as now, That smile, when years have fled; And left their wrinkles on thy brow, Their silver on thy head. Still may that name in memory dwell, Loved guardian of thy heart; And be through life a holy spell, Recalling what thou art. Poem No. 212; c. 28 September 1850 The Reapers Are The Angels How few the reapers in life's whitening fields! How many, preying on the ripening ears, Forever scatter all the harvest yields, Planted with toil, and wet with many tears! Ah, little know they at what price was sown The seed field of the world, a waste before; When He, who sowed the seed, went forth alone, And all the toil, and all the suffering bore. But soon the Husbandman his heirs shall send, Who, from the tares, shall cull the precious wheat; And, from the heavens, the Son himself descend, And with his welcome every laborer greet; And give the weary ones his peace, his rest, And to the feast invite each ransomed guest. Poem No. 185; c. 12 October 1850 The Sumach Leaves Some autumn leaves a painter took, And with his colors caught their hues; So true to nature did they look, That none to praise them could refuse. The yellow, mingling with the red, Shone beauteous in their bright decay; And round a golden radiance shed, Like that which hangs o'er parting day. Their sister leaves that, fair as these, This far had shared a common lot; All soiled, and scattered by the breeze, Are now by every one forgot. Soon trodden under foot of men, Their very forms will cease to be; Nor they remembered be again, Till Autumn decks once more the tree. But these shall still their beauty boast, To praise the painter's wondrous art; When Autumn's glories all are lost, And with the fading year depart. And through the wintry months so pale The Sumach's brilliant hues recall; Where, waving over hill and vale, They gave its splendor to our Fall. Poem No. 427; c. 9 November 1850 The Just Do all thy acts with strictest justice square, Lov'st thou thy neighbor, as thou lov'st thyself; Refusing in unrighteousness to share, Loving Christ's Kingdom, more than worldly pelf? Does morning find thee, with its earliest beam, Seeking each selfish purpose to control; And, when the stars upon thy labors gleam, Is there no stain, no burden on thy soul? Then mayst thou rest in peace: for thee the sun Does from his ocean-bed each morning rise; And, when across the heavens his course is run, For thee the dusky night his place supplies; That thou with quiet conscience still may sleep, While watchful stars above their vigils keep. Poem No. 101; c. 28 December 1850 Slavery Not by the railing tongues of angry men, Who have not learned their passions to control; Not by the scornful words of press and pen, That now ill-omened fly from pole to pole; Not by fierce party cries; nor e'en by blood, Can this our Country's guilt be washed away; In vain for this would flow the crimson flood, In vain for this would man his brother slay. Not by such means; but by the power of prayer; Of faith in God, joined with a sense of sin; These, these alone can save us from despair, And o'er the mighty wrong a victory win; These, these alone can make us free from all That doth ourselves, our Country still inthral. Poem No. 362; c. 4 January 1851 The Fugitive Slaves Ye sorrowing people! who from bondage fly, And cruel laws, that men against you make; Think not that none there are who hear your cry, And for yourselves, and children thought will take. Though now bowed down with sorrow and with fear, Lift up your heads! for you are not alone; Some Christian hearts are left your flight to cheer, Some human hearts not wholly turned to stone. God to his angels shall give strictest charge, And in their hands they'll bear you safe from harm; Where, in a freer land, you'll roam at large, Nor dread pursuit, nor start at each alarm; Till in His time you shall return again, No more to feel man's wrath, or dread his chain. Poem No. 854; 3 March 1851 The Lost Sheep Suggested by an Engraving Beneath the wild thorn stretched upon the ground, Lo, Christ the wanderer from his fold has found; Pierced by the thorns it torn and bleeding lies, And fills the desert with its piteous cries. Neglected by its shepherd, it had strayed, And left the murmuring brook, and sunny glade; To wander, parched and hungry, o'er the plain, No more its happy pastures to regain. And he, who should have searched, with anxious fear, On every hill and valley, far and near; And, when he found, upon his shoulder laid, And with his friends a great rejoicing made; Cared not to leave his ease the lost to find, To give it food, its bleeding wounds to bind; He heeded not its fate, nor piteous cry, But left it suffering, there alone to die. But Christ, who careth for the lost and poor, His Father's mansions left to seek and cure; He from its foot plucked out the festering thorn, Smoothed its soft fleece, by cruel branches torn; And bore it, in his arms, beside the brink Of cooling stream, and gave it there to drink; There washed the crimson from its bleeding side, And with the tender grass its wants supplied; Then, calling it by name, he homeward led, And as his own the lost and wandering fed. Poem No. 67; April 1851 Thoughts and Desires How, in the inmost soul, Do thoughts, desires have birth? Own they no just controul, Are they of heaven, or earth; As chance, or outward things Do bid them come and go? Can none controul the springs Of his own joy, or woe? Yes: ours the power of prayer To Him, who rules within; Whose sway extends e'en there, Where thoughts, desires begin. God's eye doth there behold The thoughts of every mind; The heart's desire untold, The purpose, but designed. And He can cleanse the heart From every guilty stain; And Peace and Power impart, That ever will remain. Lord, give us strength to pray, To fix the wandering thought; Till we have learned thy perfect way, And unto Thee are brought. Poem No. 188; April 1851 Hymn Tune,ââArlington.â As by the quickening breath of Spring, The flowers and buds unfold, And on the air their perfume fling, And deck the fields with gold; So, by the life Instruction gives Do minds their powers expand; And man a nobler being lives, Nobler in heart and hand. No more with dull and grovelling thought, He idle roves the earth; With busy hands the works are wrought To which his mind gives birth. He builds the city's dwellings fair, He sails across the sea; And doth in nature's secrets share, Her might and mystery. The factory huge, the tapering spire, Alike proclaim his skill; The steam-drawn car, the electric fire, Are subject to his will. He bows not now in mental night To idols like the clod; But in his soul receives the Light, And worships only God. Poem No. 52; c. 15 May 1851 The Soul's Rest Rejoice ye weary! ye whose spirits mourn, There is a rest which shall not be removed; Press on and reach within the heavenly bourne, By Christ, the King of your Salvation, proved. There is a rest! Rejoice ye silent stars, Roll on no more all voiceless on your way; Thou Sun! no more dark cloud thy triumph bars, Speak thou to every land the coming day. And thou, my soul, that feel'st the rest within, That greater art than star, or burning sun; Rejoice! for thou hast known the rest from sin, And hast the eternal life in God begun: Praise thou the Lord, with every living thing, And for his grace with saints, and angels sing. Poem No. 407; c. 21 June 1851 The Sliding Rock Passing up the turnpike a few evenings since, I saw the workmen just finishing a drill in the centre of the beautiful Sliding Rock, which, ever since Salem was settled, has been the play-place of the children, in the upper part of the city. By the feet of many generations it was worn as smooth as polished marble. I felt a pang, as the blast shivered it into pieces, and echoed from the hills around. I have endeavored to commemorate the pleasant associations connected with it by a few lines. The Sliding Rock! that pleasant spot, So dear in childhood's hour; Say, can it ever be forgot, While memory holds her power? How smooth 'twas worn! Like glass, or steel, Its polished surface shone; No hobbly place the foot could feel, Upon that slippery stone. For boys and girls, with busy feet, Its face kept ever bright; There oft for play they loved to meet, At morn, and noon, and night. I see them now, at even-tide, A merry, happy band; I see them ready for a slide, Upon its top they stand. Now as the oldest takes the lead, And glides across its face; They, one by one, in turn succeed,â And then renew the race. They seem as if with wings possest, As up and down they go; Without a pause, or moment's rest, Above, and now below. When hot and weary down they sit, And watch the passers by; With pleasant smiles their faces lit, And pleasure in each eye; They sit and watch the pasture gate, Till it shall open wide For yonder herd, that stand and wait, Upon the green hill's side; They count their number as they crowd The path beneath their feet; And hear their lowings, long and loud, Far down the busy street. The dusty traveller with his staff There stops to watch their play; Pleased with their sport and merry laugh; Then passes on his way. The loaded stage, with quickening speed, Comes rumbling down the hill; While every panting, smoking steed New ardor seems to fill. But now the travellers all are gone, The shadows darker grow; They leave, 'till morn, the sliding stone, And to their homes they go. The fire-flies gleam among the hay, The stars are in the sky; And, wearied with their pleasant play, In slumbers sweet they lie. Poem No. 564; July 1851 The Potato Blight Nature has her sickly years, 'Tis to show she's not divine; In the failure it appears Of an humble, blighted vine. Says vain man, with plenty blest, âThus to-morrow too shall be;â But who knows what will be best? Who the morrow can foresee? On the morrow, in his sight, Droops his harvest far and wide; Touched by some mysterious blight, Sent to humble human pride. â'Tis the effect of natural laws,â Says proud Science, blinded still; âI will show mankind its cause, And remove it by my skill.â âGod no miracle has wrought, Since creation's early hour; When from chaos, or from naught, Worlds were fashioned by his power.â But the human heart, more wise, Sees in this His present hand; And in lowly wisdom, tries All He does to understand. Asks, âwhy, with a blighted vine, Nations' fate should be entwined?â âHow all nature doth combine To fulfill what God's designed?â Learns whate'er the Lord may give, Or whate'er he takes away; Trusting in His love to live, That doth feed us day by day. With new sympathy it glows For its hapless neighbor's lot; And its love to others shows, Who to like distress are brought. Feels that all mankind are one, Not in knowledge, but in love; And, wherever shines the sun, Should their common kindred prove. Poem No. 347; c. 4 October 1851 Congregational Singing With the spirit Christians sung, In the church's early days; Every heart, and every tongue Joined the soul-inspiring praise. Gathered in an upper room, In the desert lone and drear, In the cavern's midnight gloom, Rose their voices loud and clear. Giving thanks for every gift, Asking wisdom, asking grace; Thus they sought their souls to lift, When they met in every place. Now, though mighty temples stand Rearing their high walls to heaven, Filling every Christian land, No such praise to God is given. Silent is the people's voice In the temples of the Lord; Never do their hearts rejoice, Singing hymns in sweet accord. Like the sounding ocean's waves, When they break along our coast; Should arise, to Him who saves, Praises from his countless host. Vain the labored strains of art, That but please the nicer ear; 'Tis the music from the heart, That the common heart doth cheer. Simple tunes, that lingering dwell In the temple of the mind; And with secret, holy spell Soul to soul forever bind. Strains that lift our thoughts above Earthly toil, and earthly care; Filling all our souls with love Every grief and joy to share. Poem No. 849; c. 6 December 1851 Kossuth Illustrious man! who doth to heaven appeal Against the tyrant's might, and tyrant's wrong; And, as thine own, thy Country's wounds doth feel, Forget not in whose strength vain man is strong: Not in the mighty winds that mountains shake, Not in the earthquake, nor the avenging fire; But in the still small voice Jehovah spake, Rebuking thus his warlike prophet's ire. 'Tis ours for Truth to suffer, and to speak; But not to fight, or warlike trumpet blow; The strength of armies in her cause is weak, And Freedom finds in these her deadliest foe; For never can the Truth, or Right prevail, Till rust consume the sword, and warrior's mail. Poem No. 295; January 1852 John Woolman Friend of the slave, and friend of all mankind; He felt for all that suffering man doth feel; And labored through his life, with humble mind, The cause of all his suffering to reveal. He preached deliverance to the captive slave, Justice and mercy to his cruel lord; Strong in his faith and love, who came to save, And bring fulfilment to the prophet's word;â Thou sowd'st not seed in vain; in want and tears Oft journeying from place to place alone; The rich reward of all thy toils appears, A glorious harvest waves, where it was sown; And countless reapers, with their sickles stand, Reaping what thou didst sow with single hand. Poem No. 139; c. 6 March 1852 Hymn Waiting for Christ Thou for Christ has waited long, Art thou weary, art thou faint? Still have patience, and be strong, Such his charge to every saint. Hast thou suffered, for his name, Persecution, scorn, and loss? Count not suffering, want, nor shame, Ever glory in the cross. Mind not scoffers, when they say, âWhere's the Coming of the Lord?â âWho shall see his glorious day?â He is faithful to his word. He, too, waited long for thee; Called thee, but thou still delayed; Longed from sin to set thee free, And for thee his Father prayed. With compassion, from on high, Still he views thy sufferings here; By the Spirit still is nigh, What can then his follower fear? Fainting, suffering, still abide Constant in thy Savior's love; In his promises confide, He can never faithless prove. âLo!â he says, âI quickly come, Thou my Glory too shalt see; That which fills my Father's home, That which He has given me.â Poem No. 674; c. 26 June 1852 The Wild Rose of Plymouth Upon the Plymouth shore the wild rose blooms As when the Pilgrims lived beside the bay And scents the morning air with sweet perfumes, Though new this hour more ancient far than they; More ancient than the wild, yet friendly race, That roved the land before the Pilgrims came; And here for ages found a dwelling-place Of whom our histories tell us but the name! Though new this hour out from the Past it springs Telling this summer morning of earth's prime; And happy visions of the Future brings That reach beyond, e'en to the verge of time; Wreathing earth's children in one flowery chain Of Love and Beauty ever to remain. Poem No. 754; 28 June 1852 Voting In The Old North Church No unfit place is this wherein to vote, That once a Temple was to the Most High. Though some may deem it as a thing of chance, That it for such a purpose should be used; I see in this a sign of deep import Unto my Country, and her future weal: A sign it is, that with no foolish haste, No ignorance of what our duty is, No base or sordid purpose in our souls, We on this The Communion Table, on which the Ballot box is placed. Table now should lay our votes, And exercise a freeman's holy trust. Hence ye profane! who would these courts invade With consciences defiled, and passions fierce; Who scorn all bounds, and, in the sacred name Of Liberty; indulge in foul excess, Shouting her name to violate her rights. Hence too ye ignorant! who know not yet The value of the rights, which you enjoy. Neglecting your own minds, in vain you strive To serve your Country in her hour of need. The ends of Government, its righteous ends, Peace, Order, Industry, and steady growth In Knowledge, and in Virtue, are forgot By ignorant, deluded multitudes; For mad Ambition's warlike, wasteful schemes. The industrious citizen and peaceful man, Who for long years has served his country well, And understands her history, and her laws; Is set aside for heroes of an hour; Who nothing know, but to excell in arms, And nothing but a victory recommends. In vain does Freedom, with her gifts, endow A people; that neglect to know their worth, Or satisfy the claims on which they are held. Ye sordid hence! if such, in such a land, There live; who, though in deepest poverty, Could so forget a freeman's holy trust, As for the heaviest purse to sell their votes! Hence all, who have not in their heart of hearts Their Country's good! who bring not here to lay Upon her altar sincere gifts, and free. Who, by whatever name they may be called, Seek not her highest welfare as their own. Oft as I tread these courts, I seem to hear A voice, still lingering round their walls, which says, âYe who would serve your Country, serve your God. Choose ye this day, if ye will serve the Lord. Do justice, and love mercy. Let not pride Of country blind you to your country's sins. Uphold not by your votes her wickedness, Her love of war, the oppression of the slave, Or any wrong, that man inflicts on man. Give the law's sanction only to what's just, To precepts such as reason doth approve, And Christ has taught. Obedient to these truths, Americans! your Country's safe. The will Of the majority will prove the reign of right, Of reason, and self-government mature. And He who rules the nations shall sustain, And cherish your Republic; till it grow To be a blessing, lasting and unmixed, To all the human race.â Poem No. 358; c. 10 July 1852 The Day Lily Learn O man! the worth of time, By the lily's humble flowers; Not alone the stars sublime Mark for thee the rolling hours. See below thee, at thy feet, Where it lifts its purple bell; Hear it hour by hour repeat, âDay is passing, use it well.â Flower by flower blooms forth to die, With the course of every sun; On the rod they drooping lie, Telling each of duty done. Waste not then a single day, That both heaven and earth record; But, in cheerful haste, obey Their harmonious-spoken word. Rouse thee, ere thy life has flown, Speak thy word, and do thy deed; In the field of Time is sown, Precious, and immortal seed. Every seed thou sowest now Shall a future harvest bear; In the furrows of thy plough Wave the wheat, or useless tare! Poem No. 315; July 1852 The Solitary Worshipper A single member of the Society of Friends, in Boston, is said to have gone to their place of worship for some years after all his fellow-worshippers were dead. Alone and silent there he sat Within the house of prayer; Where, once with him, his brethren met, In silent worship there. They all had gone; the young and old Were gathered to the dead; He saw no more their friendly looks, He heard no more their tread. Yet still he loved, as came the day, When they were wont to meet, To tread the old familiar way, And take his 'customed seat. Plain was the place, an humble hall, In which he sat alone; The show of forms, the pride of art To him were all unknown. No organ pealed its solemn notes, No choir the stillness broke, No preacher read the sacred page, Or to his hearers spoke. He needed not those outward things To wake the reverent mind; For other ends than such as this, They seemed to him designed. In silence, gathered to himself, The Spirit he implored; And without speech, or outward sign, The Father he adored. And to his mind was opened then The meaning of the word, âAsk and receive,â âseek ye and findâ The Spirit of the Lord. That Spirit strengthened and consoled, And gave him inward sight; And round the lonely worshipper There shone a marvellous light! No more alone! For he had come To Zion's holy hill, The city of the Living God, Which saints and angels fill. The elders there with silver locks, The sisters' modest grace, The young, in all their innocence, With glory filled the place. No cloud of sorrow, or of care A soul had ever known, That in that happy band he saw, Nor felt it e'er alone. Their looks of peace and love unchanged Assured his trembling soul; And bade him banish every fear, And every doubt controul. With them again, as when on earth, He held communion sweet; And by their sympathy was made For heaven's own worship meet. Poem No. 34; c. 30 October 1852 Sonnet, To the Rev. James Flint, D. D., On reading his Collection of Poems. The Poet often strives, on eagle's wings, Above the earth, and all it holds to soar; Forgetting humble, and familiar things, Which touch the heart, and thus improve us more. Not such thy Verse, beloved, and honored Friend! Which loves our earthly griefs, and joys to share; And doth amusement with instruction blend, Dwelling on every object grand and fair. Of Change it tells, propitious, or adverse, That, in Time's flight, our own New England's known; And doth, in pensive, pleasing strains, rehearse The changes which Old Harvard's halls have shown. Thine too are Hymns; that elevate and cheer, And all our homes, and temples more endear. Poem No. 542; October 1852 The Mind The Greatest Mystery I threw a stone into a cavern deep, And listening heard it from the floor rebound; It could not from my thought its secret keep, Though hidden from the sight its depth I found; I dropped a lead into the ocean brine, That silent sank; I sought its depth to know; And the swift running of the deep sea line Told me how far was ocean's bed below; By geometric skill I spanned the sky, And found how far from earth the fixed star; Through widening spaces glanced my wondering eye, Where the last sun lights up the heavens afar; But when, from these, I turned to explore the mind, In vain or height, or depth I sought to find. Poem No. 276; December 1852 The Conspiracy Nations and kings conspire against the Lord, Exulting in their numbers, and their might; And in their pride reject His holy word, Proclaiming to the world that Power is Right. The prophets in the dungeons pine and die, The patriots from their country far are driven; The captives toiling in their bondage cry, And raise their eyes, and fettered hands to heaven. Cast down, O Lord, the proud! Uphold the weak! For Thou art God of heaven, and earth, and sea; Make bold thy servants, Lord, thy truth to speak; Our country save, and set the captives free; Rule Thou in righteousness through Christ thy Son, And, as in heaven, on earth thy will be done. Poem No. 346; 8 February 1853 The Horsemen on the Sands Upon the treacherous sands the horsemen ride, And careless pass the bright and happy day; Unmindful of the swift returning tide, That long has warned them of their mad delay. The winds arise, and sudden falls the night, On every side the hungry billows roar; With breathless haste they urge their rapid flight, And, with their utmost speed, scarce gain the shore. So, on the sands of Time we careless live, Forgetting oft, how short life's little day; And scarce a serious thought to duty give, Till all its golden hours have fled away; And but a few short moments yet remain, In which we may the Shore in safety gain. Poem No. 756; 24 March 1853 My Dear Brother Washington He passed away with morning light, Released from every pain; For him, the weary hours of night No longer could remain. O holy Light! that blessed his eyes, Before they closed in peace; Symbol of that, which doth arise, When earthly sorrows cease. The sun arose; with faith possest, He felt his Father near; And sunk in peaceful, childlike rest, Without a doubt, or fear. In that last hour, with parting breath, His sorrowing friends he cheered; And, as in life, so in his death, He was to all endeared. Still, with the eye of faith, I see His form to us so dear; Though dimmed my earthly sight may be, With many a falling tear. Poem No. 163; 30 April 1853 On Seeing The Victoria Regia In Bloom, At The Garden of J. Fisk Allen Esq. July 22d, 1853. Thou wondrous Flower! in which, on grander scale Than in our northern clime, we see displayed Creative Power, and Skill, that never fail; By which the world and all therein were made; With reverence on thy beauty would I gaze, Inhale thy fragrance, and admire thy Leaf; Whose wondrous size, and structure claim our praise, Surpassing our conception and belief. Yet on our ponds &amp; streams, O Tropic Queen! The The Pond-Lily type of thee in stem, and leaf, and flower, In beauty, and in fragrance too is seen; Displaying here the same Creative Power, As where, on Amazon's gigantic stream, Thou lift's thy head to greet the morning beam. Poem No. 705; c. 22 July 1853 On Finding the Truth With sweet surprise, as when one finds a flower, Which in some lonely spot, unheeded, grows; Such were my feelings, in the favored hour, When Truth to me her beauty did disclose. Quickened I gazed anew on heaven and earth, For a new glory beamed from earth and sky; All things around me shared the second birth, Restored with me, and nevermore to die. The happy habitants of other spheres, As in times past, from heaven to earth came down; Swift fled in converse sweet the unnumbered years, And angel-help did human weakness crown! The former things, with Time, had passed away, And Man, and Nature lived again for aye. Poem No. 846; July 1853 Goliath With bold, unblushing front the Giant Wrong Stalks forth, with helmet armed, and sword, and spear; In its own strength, and brazen armor strong, Inspiring e'en the hosts of God with fear! Thus War amidst the nations rears its head, Thus Slavery defies its banded foes; They fill the world with tumults and with dread, And to the present add prophetic woes. But oft, by feeblest arm, God shows his might, When e'en the numerous host with terror quails; Some stripling David dares the unequal fight, And in the name of Israel's God prevails; To show the earth the Lord is God alone, And Strength, and Skill, and Victory are his own. Poem No. 833; October 1853 A Sunset In Haverhill To a high hill, that overlooks The Merrimac, and Haverhill town; I climbed one pleasant afternoon To see the setting sun go down. The summit gained, I gazed around On farm, and forest, town, and stream; Each formed for each, a beauteous whole, Bathed in the Autumn's yellow beam. Asleep upon the river lay A fertile island fair, and large; With elm, and oak, and maple fringed, Blending their hues around its marge. I could not tell, which fairer seemed, The heavens above, or earth below; The woods in richest colors drest, Or gorgeous sunset's purple glow. Upon the horizon's utmost rim, Inspiring thoughts and feelings high, Wachusett and Monadnock stood, Like pillars of the vaulted sky! Still larger grew the orb of day, Still brighter, till it passed from sight; And on the distant hill-top left A golden diadem of light. Why haste to other lands, I said? Why leave so fair a scene behind? In western, or in eastern clime, Canst thou a fairer prospect find? Poem No. 735; October 1853 The Past Thou Past! What art thou? whither dost thou lead Through countless generations fled away; Empires, and races, that have left no trace, Save in the nameless mound, or city's site, Disputed oft, and called by different names. Thou point'st to Nineveh, and storied Thebes, To Aegypt's pyramids, and Paestum's fanes; And say'st, with solemn, awe-inspiring voice, âThese are of yesterday, compared with Me.â And still thou beckon'st on, with shadowy hand, Through hoary epochs before man was made, And at the head of the creation placed. I pass gigantic forms, unknown to man, Save by their impress, left upon the rock; Or their huge bones dug from the miry clay; Mammoth and Mastodon, and, stranger still, The monsters of the Oolitic age. And still beyond, amidst gigantic ferns, And towering reeds, I pass; whose thick rank growth, O'erwhelmed by fire and flood, was changed to coal; Before the lofty mountains were upheaved. Not there, nor in the central depths beneath, I reach the boundaries of thy mighty realm. Leaving the earth, I soar amidst the stars, And far beyond the solar system range; Where light, the swiftest messenger of God, Has winged its arrowy flight for countless years, Yet never reached the world to which 'twas sent! Lost and bewildered, by the amazing thought, In vain I seek above, as on the earth, Thy origin; or what thou art, O Past! Wearied with outward search, I turn within; And, of my soul, I ask thy origin. But vainly there would I explore thy depths. For deeper mysteries within us lie, Than in the world of time and sense without. Of spirit's hidden essence, who can tell, Or mark, by years, the time when it began? The mind within its mighty thought can grasp The laws, that bind the planets in their course, Measure the stars' vast distance from the earth, Predict the wandering comet's sure return, Compel the elements to do its will. In vain Philosophy would seek to read The dark inscriptions on the human soul, More ancient, and obscure than print of beast, Or bird, or tree, left on the solid rock, When the foundations of the earth were laid. In God alone my wandering mind can rest, In Him the Present, Past, and Future meet. Though, to our weak view, succession marks The history of man, and all we see; And e'en our language echoes with the past; Yet this is but our feeble, finite thought, That sees not from beginning to the end. He who, in the Beginning, formed the earth, And woke the soul to conscious life and joy; He fixed thy boundaries, O mysterious Past! And crowned Thee monarch of thy mighty realm. And He determined, when thy reign shall end, And in our thought Eternity begin. Poem No. 688; c. 26 November 1853 Hymn, Sung at the Thompson Jubilee, at Barre, Jan. 12, 1854 We hail our Jubilee to-day, The Christian's Jubilee comes round! We come our grateful vows to pay, For this we bid the trumpet sound. Its welcome notes our bosoms thrill, For earthly blessings long enjoyed; How large a space their memories fill, With pleasures sweet and unalloyed! The Lord has blessed each fruitful field, And we would of his goodness tell; Our Fathers' farms abundance yield, And here their sons in safety dwell. With Health, and Liberty, and Peace, For fifty years He's crowned our lot; O, may these blessings never cease, Or be in coming time forgot. For fifty years thy servant, Lord, Has preached the Gospel of thy love; We thank Thee for thy saving Word, All other gifts how far above! Behold, as in a fruitful land, The precious seed he here has sown; Still prosper, Lord, thy servant's hand, And still, as Thine, the Vineyard own. Till, resting from his earthly care, He join thy saints in courts above; In higher joys, and duties share, And feel new measures of thy love. Poem No. 761; c. 12 January 1854 On The Nebraska Bill An Eden land, an Eden in the west, Where once the Indians roamed erect and free; Where now their few and weary tribes find rest, Shall it be blasted, cursed by Slavery? Our plighted faith to the red man was given, That there should be the asylum of his race; Our vow to Afric's sons is writ in heaven, And shall we thus fair Freedom's name disgrace? O plant not then the poisonous upas there, Nor heed the subtle serpent's guileful speech; Bur rather bid all races come and share, And Freedom's Gospel to the nations teach; That unborn millions there may learn its name, And the glad tidings through the world proclaim. Poem No. 46; 27 February 1854 On An Ear Of Wheat Brought, By My Brother, From The Field Of Waterloo Sign of Plenty, Peace, and Joy, From a field once desolate; Where conflicting armies met, Filled with pride, revenge, and hate; Where all Europe was in arms, And its mightiest captains led; And the promise of the year Trampled was by soldiers' tread; Welcome! for thou tell'st of Him, Who in trouble is our Friend; Upon whom, though earth shall shake, We unmoved may still depend. Sign art thou, that on the earth God will cause all wars to cease; And the hostile tribes of men All to dwell in Love and Peace. Sign, that still his word is sure; That, while earth itself remains, Seed-time, harvest, shall not fail Whitening all her fruitful plains. Hasten, Lord, the coming years, By thy Prophets long foretold; And may we the promise find, That Thou mad'st to them of old. Poem No. 422; March 1854 The Dead Elm It stands amidst the beauty of the Spring, Its graceful outline stretched against the sky; Warm suns, and rains, which life to others bring, Blossoms, and leaves to it alone deny. A subtle gas has been its fatal foe, Through all the ground the noxious fumes have spread; Its roots have drunk the poisoned stream below, The noble elm roots, trunk, and limbs, is dead! So, without sign of aught the soul can harm, Amidst a sinful world, it droops and dies; Concealed, the evil gives it no alarm, When, from gross vice, with wings of fear, it flies; Its subtle foe is in the air it breathes, Mixed with the very food on which it lives. Poem No. 307; 30 May 1854 Hymn Sung at the Celebration of the Fourth of July, in Salem, 1854. Hail, Love of Country! noble flame, That never can expire; In every age and clime the same, Alike in son and sire. Light in our souls a holy zeal, As one united band, Our growing Country's wounds to heal, And all her foes to withstand. No more to battle would we go To fight against our kind; Through human veins one blood doth flow, And one the heart and mind. But forth we go to break the chain Of error and of sin, To free our land from every stain, And rights for all to win. To triumph in the Gospel's might, And Christian patriots be; To battle for the Truth and Right, And every bondsman free. Poem No. 155; c. 4 July 1854 The Camphene Lamp Fatal Lamp! whose brilliant ray Shines in homes of rich, and poor; Yet more false than leads astray Traveler o'er the midnight moor. Thou dost in man's dwelling come, Promising to aid, and bless; But has filled his peaceful home With keen anguish, and distress. Gathered round the social board, At the happy evening hour, Each to each in love restored, What for evil can have power? Naught but Thee, thou baleful light! Since 1850 from the use of camphene and kindred articles for the purpose of illumination, there have been 169 persons killed, and 279 wounded. J.V. Author of so many woes; Better far primeval night, Than the day thy beam bestows. Like the box, that artful Jove Sent the first of human kind; Thou a curse to man dost prove, Every plague in one combined. Wise Prometheus did reject E'en the gift of heaven's high king;â We should treat, with like neglect, Gifts, that death and suffering bring. Let the Press its warning sound, Till no more sad tales we hear; And thy light no more be found In the home to us so dear. Poem No. 118; c. 18 July 1854 The Homeless Wind Where hast thou been roaming, Thou houseless, homeless wind? Thy voice is sad and moaning, Thou hast none of thy kind. Wind âI've been in lone places, Upon the wild sea shore; Where billow billow chases, And listened to their roar. I've been on the high hill-top, And on the lonely plain; Where'er I roamed, I could not stay Contented to remain. Now, around man's dwelling, From places lone and drear, My story I've been telling, But found I none to hear. For none there had feeling For the houseless, homeless wind; To receive its sad revealing, In sympathy of mind.â Poem No. 805; c. 13 January 1855 What Of The Night? What of the night? O watchman! tell, Who on the watchtower high doth stand; What of the night? I hear it swell In every tongue, from every land. Lo! half the earth in darkness lies, Millions to idols bend the knee; When shall the day-spring bless their eyes, And the deep gloom before it flee? Nations that boast the Christian name, Still meet as foes in bloody fight; When shall they own their deeds with shame, And in the ways of Peace delight? When shall they use the talents lent, To elevate and bless mankind; Each with its own domain content, Each to its proper sphere confined? When shall the Church the risen Lord Own as the Way, the Truth, the Life? Walk in obedience to his Word, And cease from every angry strife? When shall the year of Jubilee Return to bless Columbia's soil; And all her captive sons be free, Who now in cruel bondage toil? The watchman saith, âThe morning's nigh, Awake, ye dwellers in the land! The redd'ning dawn is in the sky, And the Lord's kingdom is at hand.â âI watched of old when Babylon fell, And heard afar her mighty fall;â But greater tidings now I tell To all who shall for tidings call.â Poem No. 780; c. 3 February 1855 To the Memory of the Rev. James Flint, D.D. Much-loved Pastor! thou hast gone To thy longed-for home of rest; Suffering past, and duties done, Thou with heavenly peace art blest. With the Sabbath's closing hour, Peaceful passed thy life away; Fell disease had lost its power, Naught thine upward flight could stay. We would follow, but in vain, With our feeble, earthly sight; Faith alone those heights can gain, See thee midst the dazzling light. Where thou dost communion hold With loved spirits gone before; And in thine embrace enfold Near and dear, to part no more. Let thy Holy Spirit, Lord, Comfort to the mourners bring; Such the promise of thy Word, To that promise, Lord, we cling. May it in our hearts renew Holy zeal, and fervent love; Till again his face we view In our Father's house above. Poem No. 333; 9 March 1855 McLean Asylum, Somerville Oh! House of Refuge; for those weary souls, Trembling on dizzy heights, mid gloom and shade, While Reason from their path her light withholds, Oh! House of Refuge! thou for them wast made. Oh! House of Refuge! ever stand thou thereâ A Refuge thou from fiery Passion's swayâ A shelter from the scorching heat of careâ A Holy Refuge, in grief's wintry day. The hand of kindness reared thy stately pile, A goodness kinder keeps thee fair within; Thy gates are open, and a welcome smile Here greets the weary wandererâenter in. Oh! House of Refuge; thou receivest all, The young, the old, the innocent, the gay; The sighs, the groans, the burning tears that fall, Oh! Holy Refuge! thou wilt chase away. Oh! House of blissful Hope! The orb of day First robes thy lofty domes with morning light So the first dawn of orient Reason's ray Beneath thy walls lights up the soul's dark night. A House of Refuge, and a home of love, A blest retreat, to me, thou wast for years, When discord, doubt and fear for mastery stroveâ There, first, His bow of Peace shone amid falling tears. Poem No. 383; March 1855 The Age Changeful and Worldly Amidst a changeful, worldly age like ours, How hard to keep a fixed, aspiring mind! The Present with its sights and sounds o'erpowers, And makes us to the Past and Future blind. In vain does History tell, with faithful page, Of mighty realms by luxury o'erthrown; Men heed not, in an over-anxious age, Their ruined capitals with grass o'ergrown. In vain the prophets of a coming time Proclaim for earth a bright, millennial day; But few, responsive to their call sublime, With a high purpose live, and toil, and pray; Lord, from our hearts, pluck up each noxious weed, And, in their places, sow the heavenly seed! Poem No. 40; c. 26 May 1855 Hymn So also will God, through Jesus, bring with him them who sleep. They, that in the Savior sleep, Are not perished, are not dead; Christ his own doth faithful keep, All for whom on earth he bled. Sleeping, waking, we are one, In the one, and risen Lord; They, who from our sight have gone, Soon with Him shall be restored! Naught created can divide Soul from soul and heart from heart; We in Him do still abide, Though from earthly scenes we part. Weep not then, as others weep, Who nor hope, nor peace have found; Nor the soul in pleasures steep, Which amid the world abound. Keep their memories bright and fair, Who, in Christ, have passed away; Give not way to dark despair, Rather strive, and watch, and pray. Faith will take from death its sting; And the friends, whom we deplore, God, through Jesus, too will bring, And with Him again restore. Poem No. 649; June 1855 âBlessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.â Math. 5:4. How blessed the tears of those, who still weep on, When they have ceased to feel Affliction's rod; Forgetful that from them the chastening's gone, Their eyes behold in faith their Father, God! No more their tears for pain, and suffering flow, They weep, for joy, to know their sins forgiven; That God, e'en on the sinful, doth bestow, Through his dear Son, the peace, and bliss of heaven. Thus, when the storm is o'er, and, in the west, The sun breaks forth amid the falling shower; In heavenly hues the far-off clouds are drest, And songs are heard within the sparkling bower; And Nature weeps; though, midst her falling tears, The bow of Promise in the clouds appears. Poem No. 179; c. 14 July 1855 To The Memory Of The Rev. James Chisholm Amidst the sick and dying, falling round, He stood the faithful Pastor, and the friend; In every call of duty ready found, And loving his own charge unto the end. Chisholm! thy memory long shall cherished be In every state of this our country wide, Both South and North in one, the bond and free Shall speak of thee with patriotic pride! Thy gentle manners and thy loving heart Thy friends and classmates long shall cherish here; Called, in mid-life, from one they loved to part; They drop, in sympathy, the falling tear, With sorrowing kindred, that for thee shall weep, Who now hath gone reward in heaven to reap. Poem No. 44; 21 September 1855 The Woodwax Laughing, midst its yellow blooms, At the fire, that it consumes; Springs the woodwax every year, It has naught from man to fear. From the turnpike's grassy side, See it flourish far and wide, On the steep and rocky hills; Naught the woodwax hurts, or kills. Over all the pastures spread, Where the humblest feet may tread; Richer carpet never king For his palace flower could bring. Glorious sight, in summer time, 'Tis, to see it in its prime; With its spikes of flowers untold, Covering all the hills with gold! Though a plant of stranger race, It with us has found a place; Vain the farmer's art, or toil, That would drive it from the soil. Vain in winter is the fire, Which he kindles in his ire; Still it laughs amidst its blooms, At the flame, that it consumes. Poem No. 314; October 1855 The First Telegraphic Message What hath God wrought? What hath God wrought? Along the iron wires, The electric current, swift as thought, Of this our Age enquires. What marvel in these latter days, His purpose to fulfil; Has God, to whom be all the praise, Wrought with sublimest skill. From land to land, from shore to shore, He stretches wide the chain; Which shall in one forevermore Link all earth's broad domain. The wandering Indian of the west Shall see it stretching on, To where the setting sun finds rest, And hear what God hath done. And where again, from ocean's bed, On eastern lands he shines; By millions shall the words be read, Transmitted o'er its lines. The North and South shall hear the word, O'er all their frozen plains; And nations with new thought be stirred, Where Winter ever reigns. And each in his own tongue shall hear The Message it has brought, And all shall say, with love and fear, Behold What God Hath Wrought. Poem No. 772; 24 November 1855 The Mission Of The Friends To The Emperor Nicholas Bold in their cause they stood before the Czar, Careless alike of splendor and of power; To bear their witness 'gainst the coming war, Which over Europe darkly 'gan to lower: Of Love, Forgiveness, and of Peace they spoke, The laws which Christ unto the nations gave; Which king, nor people never can revoke, And which alone can king, or people save. They pleaded, in behalf of suffering man, The countless evils, which from war must flow; Moved, deeply moved, ere yet the strife began, By thought of human agony and woe; And fearless spake the threatening of the Lord, âWho take the sword shall perish by the sword!â Poem No. 73; January 1856 Be of Good Courage Ye who against the evils of our lot Alone, and single-handed do contend; Faint not! though you to greatest straits are brought, And earthly succor fail, and earthly friend. Near you in sympathy the angels stand, Their unseen hosts encompass you around; Strong, and unconquerable the glorious band, And loud their songs, and hymns of victory sound. And near you, though invisible, are those, The good and just of every age, and clime; Who, while on earth, have fought the self-same foes, And won the fight, through faith and love sublime; Let not the hosts of sin inspire a fear, For lo! far mightier hosts are ever near! Poem No. 856; c. 21 June 1856 To An Ancient Locust-Tree, Opposite Carltonville Why stand'st thou here alone, when all thy mates, That crowded by the river's bank are gone? From near a century thy history dates, Amidst new scenes thou standest now alone! How changed yon fields! how changed the river too, When on its bank thy tiny form upsprung! Swift cars and streets and work shops now we view, Where once were groves and fields, when thou wast young. On Nature's wild, yet beautiful domain, Man by his arts encroaches more and more; Acrost the river broad he throws his chain, And builds the solid bridge from shore to shore; Yet still thy top with milk-white flowers is crowned, And summer breezes waft thy fragrance round. Poem No. 828; July 1856 A Walk In The Pastures A free breath breathes in Nature, That maketh all things grow; The breath of the Creator, From whom all things do flow. It warms and gladdens all things, The flower and creeping vine, The grass which in the meadow springs, The oak and lofty pine. And every beast, and every bird, Its quickening influence feels; And tiny insect's note is heard, Whose form the leaf conceals. I feel it on our rocky hills, And lightly bound along; My languid frame new vigor fills, My voice breaks forth in song; I praise and bless the Being great, Who made this world so fair; And did for joy each thing create, And doth for all things care. Poem No. 7; August 1856 [O, cleave not to the things of earth] O, cleave not to the things of earth, For they must pass away; But for the better, heavenly birth, With earnest longings pray. Is it a time to lust for gain, To dig for golden ore; Or to relieve disease and pain, From out thine ample store? Is it a time thy wealth to spend On garments rich and rare, And naught of it to others lend, Who've not a robe to wear? Is it a time thy house to build, In grandeur all alone; With every costly luxury filled, When many a man hath none? Is it a time for thee to live For self, to earth confined; And not a thought to others give, Or to the immortal mind? Oh, cleave not to the things of earth, For they must pass away; But for the better, heavenly birth, With earnest longings pray. Poem No. 373; c. 8 November 1856 Nature Intelligible Thou art not, as the Hindoos say, A vain illusion to the sight; That doth the mind of man betray, Whilst thou his senses dost delight. No wildering maze, without a plan, In Nature doth her votary find; But glorious mansion built for man, The work of One, Eternal Mind! Floor above floor, thy strata rise, Height above height, thy mountains stand; Like pillars of the vaulted sky, O'erlooking far the sea and land. In smallest thing, in leaf, or fly, How finished, perfect every part! And, hidden from the curious eye, Are forms and hues of wondrous art. From lowest fossil in its bed, Onward Creative Thought proceeds, Through beast and bird, to man their head, And upward to his Maker leads. Summer and Autumn, Winter, Spring, Each season of the varied year, Doth each for us a lesson bring, If we but turn the listening ear. Awake, O man! and face to face With Nature stand, a living soul; And every word and letter trace, Written on her mysterious scroll. And humbly rise, from earthly things, To Revelation's truth sublime; Which from the same Great Being springs, Who built the world of space and time. Poem No. 660; c. 3 January 1857 The Great Facts Of Christ's History The traveller sees afar the mountain rise, And thinks that soon he'll reach, and scale its height; He hastens on, but finds to his surprise, No nearer grows the object to his sight. So the great facts of Jesus' history stand, While onward still we journey day by day; In youth we see them seeming near at hand, And think to master them without delay: But, in the soul's horizon, high they tower Above our common thoughts, and common ways, And a long life will scarcely lend the power, (So full is life of trifles and delays,) To reach at last the glorious mount of God, And climb the heights, on which the Savior trod. Poem No. 585; c. 14 February 1857 Freedom National, Slavery Sectional 'Tis written by God's finger on our land, On mountains, prairies, lakes, and mighty streams, 'Tis thundered by the ocean on the strand, From sun and stars in quenchless light it beams, This land to Freedom is for aye ordained! 'Twas this inspired the roving Indian's breast, 'Twas this our fathers by the sword maintained, 'Tis this which bids us feel for the oppressed. Then what are human laws, on parchment writ, Fastening on man's free limbs the heavy chain; Interpreted by learned jurists' wit, Laws born of pride of birth, and lust of gain; To those eternal laws, of God's decree, Forever sounding forth, That Man Is Free? Poem No. 734; 13 March 1857 Christ Abiding Forever I followed Christ, and vainly hoped on earth That he would stay, and in the flesh would dwell; I knew not that He came of heavenly birth, As doth the loved disciple of Him tell. Sudden He left me here! and much I grieved, And wandered on in sorrow and alone, Till in his Resurrection I believed; Then He appeared again, who just had gone; Spake of his kingdom, which must soon prevail O'er all the earth, and evermore remain; The foes which for a time would it assail; Then He ascended up to heaven again, Sending the Spirit, that the heart doth fill With joy and peace and power to do his will. Poem No. 227; c. 27 June 1857 The South River At Sunset Mirrored in the waters lie Hill and grove, and cloud and sky; Each with form distinct, and clear, As they to the eye appear. Moss-grown rocks, and grasses green, In the river's depths are seen, Ferns, and flowers with colors bright, All are pictured to the sight. See the cattle far below, Where the mimic grasses grow; Cropping still the grassy sod, As if on the earth they trod! When did painter's beauteous art Sight so fair as this impart? Vain is human skill to line, Paint with colors so divine. Thus the calm, and peaceful soul Doth reflect the mighty whole; Every object bright and fair, Heaven and earth are mirrored there. Poem No. 330; c. 8 August 1857 On Receiving A Flower From the Rev. C. H. A. Dall, in India. Fair flower! from one who toils in distant land, Preaching a Gospel sent the world to save; Welcome! for thou wast plucked by his own hand, And safe hast reached me here o'er land and wave. Why need I ask, âwhat tidings dost thou bear?â When in thy form a Father's love I see, Who for the grass, and tender flower doth care; Much more for us, wherever we may be. Dear friend! though now with dangers compassed round, And far from home, and all the heart holds dear; Still mayest thou be as ever faithful found, Trusting in God without one anxious fear; Whose Word will hush all strife, and bring the day, When wars from the whole earth shall pass away. Poem No. 107; 21 August 1857 Hymn Sung at the Dedication of Plummer Hall, Salem, Oct. 6, 1857. This building, graced with Plummer's name, We dedicate to day; Long may its influence and fame Our service here repay. To Science, and to Learning's aid We dedicate its halls; From out their calm, and peaceful shade The voice of Wisdom calls. âCome! learn what ancient sages taught, Come! list the poet's strain; Scorn pleasure's lure, and raise your thought Above the lust of gain.â âHere learn the history of your race, The mind's wide fields explore; And in the works of Nature trace A Mind to love, adore.â âFor every star that gems the night, The world's majestic plan, And things too small for human sight, A study are for man.â âFrom morn till eve, from youth till age, Delight in study find; And gain from books, and Nature's page, Food for the immortal mind;â âWhich gropes, like base and purblind things Along its darksome way; Or soars on high, with sun-bright wings, To realms of lasting day.â Poem No. 654; c. 6 October 1857 Philosophy And Religion A stern philosophy it is, which says, Bear with thy lot, O man! thou canst not change The will of God, nor alter aught his ways; For this would be all nature to derange; 'Tis the fixed law of nature men should die, And thou must, in thy turn, that law obey; To view thy fate with calm indifference try, And naught of sorrow, nor of fear betray. Not so Religion, with its heavenly voice, Speaks to the suffering, dying sons of men! It bids their sinking hearts in hope rejoice, Declares that man, though dead, shall live again; Points to the Savior, who, e'en from the grave, Has power, above all nature's might, to save. Poem No. 21; c. 28 November 1857 The Day Begins to Dawn The Day begins to dawn, O blessed word! That doth our darkness with its light illume; In the long, cheerless night of sorrow heard, It comes to banish from the mind its gloom; Bidding it wake again to life, and joy, In faith, and hope its daily tasks pursue; Wisely for good each day on earth employ, With brighter worlds than this still kept in view. Though vanished from our sight, our friends still live, Starlike and pure in Hope's immortal sphere; And to our souls a heavenly peace they give, While, subject to life's cares, we linger here; Till the pale dawn become the glorious day, And sorrow, pain, and death shall flee away. Poem No. 483; c. 22 January 1858 On The Late Mild Winter With spring-like mildness passeth, day by day, The winter months; the wild flowers bloom, And careless of the cold their charms display; Why on our faces rests a cloud of gloom? Do we not see in this mild season, sent For man's relief, a providential care? Shall we not learn a lesson of content, And with less favored ones our blessings share? All things are providential. Yet more plain We see God's hand, when tempered is the wind To the shorn lamb, and want and pain Are ministered unto by angels kind; Than when in Nature's course there is no change, And naught occurs, which we, like this, call âstrange!â Poem No. 844; 15 February 1858 The Evergreen If here the imaginative Greek had lived, And seen thy lively green, through the dead grass And leafless shrubs threading its devious way; He might have fancied thee, fair Color's self, And called thee Evergreen! And fabled thus. That, when the winter's cold had killed the grass, And robbed the forest of its emerald hue; Thou didst escape; and, hiding in the swamp, Was there transformed into this beauteous vine; Which still preserves, unchanged, the summer's green, When it has vanished from the hill and plain. Poem No. 294; c. 27 February 1858 Hindoo Converts On the Domestic Trials of Hindoo Converts. Report of Unitarian Mission in India. âI came to cast a fire into the earth,â The Savior said, that error shall consume, The false beliefs, which in the mind have birth, And with the Truth its inmost depths illume. And what will I, if now it kindled be, And natural kindred for a time divide? The end of all their trials I foresee, And heavenly mansions for their rest provide. âEndure unto the end!â That cheering word Doth still encourage all his chosen saints; They look to Him, their Master, and their Lord, Whene'er in trials sore the spirit faints; Patient endure the danger, and the strife, And tried, receive at length the Crown of Life! Poem No. 217; c. 27 March 1858 The Soul's Invitation Come, and enter Heaven, O soul! Bring the riches thou hast gained, Wealth and honors, bring the whole For which thou such toils sustained; Thou hast titles, houses, lands; Costly robes the body wore; All the busy, toiling hands Have laid up for thee in store. The Soul's Answer What are all these things to me, Now that I would upward soar? Boundless wealth on land and sea, I can never need it more. What are honors, what is power Man on man doth here bestow? They are his but for an hour, He must leave them here below. Not with these can I ascend, And amidst heaven's light appear; They nor joy, nor grace can lend In that higher, holier sphere. Nay, they ever draw me down To the dark and sinful earth; I forget the glorious crown, And my higher, heavenly birth. Not in these I put my trust, But in Him who died to save; They are now but glittering dust, Spoils and trophies of the grave! In the knowledge of my Lord, In the love that He has shown, In the keeping of His word, In these things, and these alone Trusting, I am not ashamed; And in heaven may enter in; For the Lord my name has named, And has made me free from sin. Poem No. 89; c. 24 April 1858 Morning Hymn for a little Child Glad I wake with morning light. Thou hast kept me through the night. Lord! with grateful heart I pray, Keep me through another day. Poem No. 147; c. 4 May 1858 Nature Teaches only Love Well reason they, who from the birds, and flowers Would prove that God is all a God of Love; For feelings, that transcend e'en reason's powers, To all mankind the same great doctrine prove. 'Tis true the fire, and tempest work his will, Yet not in wrath, but for the good of man; What seems to us with tear-dimmed eyes but ill, Is still a part of one all-perfect plan! The good of man, this is the gracious end, For which all things were made on earth, in heaven; To this alone forever do they tend, For this alone to man were all things given; Thus Nature with the Scriptures doth accord, For God is Love declares the Sacred Word. Poem No. 771; c. 5 June 1858 The First Atlantic Telegraph With outward signs, as well as inward life, The world is hastening onward to its end! With higher purposes our Age is rife, Than those to which with grovelling minds we tend. For lo! beneath the Atlantic's stormy breast Is laid, from shore to shore, the Electric Wire; And words, with speed of thought, from east to west Dart to and fro on wings that never tire. May never man, to higher objects blind, Forget by whom this miracle was wrought; But worship and adore the Eternal Mind, Which gave at length to man the wondrous thought; And on wise-hearted men bestowed the skill His Providential Purpose to fulfill. Poem No. 841; c. 28 August 1858 Life and Death Men live and die in secret; none can see When lighting up, or going out the flame, Save the All-Seeing eye; frail mortals, we Call death and life, what are but so in name. Death is the living to thyself in sin, Which thou dost pleasure, ease, or grandeur call; Nor even now death may for thee begin, Before the shadows of the funeral pall; Life is the lifting up which thou dost feel, When thy feet follow where love bids thee go; A life beyond disease, or severing steel, Which naught but Him who gives it fears below; Such be thy life! and thou in heaven shalt live, When men unto the earth thy body give. Poem No. 328; c. II December 1858 Lines On The Old Danvers Burying Ground Above the ancient Burying place Looks calmly down the full-orbed moon; Each well known grave I plainly trace, As in the effulgent light of noon. And through the cold, transparent air, The stars and planets brightly glow; As if they listened to the prayer Of dwellers on this sphere below. And is there not some secret tie, Some influence from yon shining spheres; Which lifts the sorrowing soul on high, Above this lowly vale of tears? There is. For gazing on this spot My tearful eyes are upward turned, And mortal feelings are forgot, A higher lesson I have learned. For He who formed the wondrous whole, And doth each planet's motions guide; Will clothe again the immortal soul, And for his children still provide. For as the earthly form we wear, The fading emblem of decay; The heavenly image we shall share, Which fadeth not, like that, away. All live to God! Though earth may hide The forms of loved ones from our sight; Our friends still live, with Him abide, Who on the grave sheds holy light. Poem No. 25; c. 28 December 1858 On Seeing The Portrait of Helen Ruthven Waterston Gazing on some higher sphere, Far, far off, and yet so near! Thou dost join, with mortal's sight, Angel's vision clear and bright. Not with vain and curious eye Dost thou gaze beyond the sky; But with warm admiring look, As if thou its life partook; And to thee were here foreshown Scenes to earthly minds unknown. Yet, as mortal, thou dost gaze Far beyond the solar blaze; And with love, unmixed with fear, Dost behold heaven's portals near! Who would thee on earth detain? Our sad loss, thy happy gain; In the many mansions fair, Which the Savior doth prepare; Parents, child, again shall meet, Joy unclouded, bliss complete! Poem No. 145; late 1858 Hymn The Promise of The Spirit When from their sight the Savior went, To dwell no more upon the earth; The Spirit to his own he sent, And souls were born of heavenly birth. He left them not as orphans here, To mourn their sad and bitter fate; But gave them promises to cheer, While in the world, their lonely state. âMy Father greater is than I, I will not leave you here alone; But send the Spirit from on high, And you, in Me, shall still be one.â Sweet promise to the mourning Bride, The Church, that mourns her absent Lord! While in his love we still abide, He will fulfil his parting word. Henceforth no more let Christians mourn; They hear again the bridegroom's voice, From heavenly heights of glory borne, Which bids them with Himself rejoice. So faith, and joy, and peace, and love, Became our heritage below; Descending, with the holy dove, On all, who Christ's obedience know. Poem No. 785; c. 19 February 1859 The Moss and Its Teachings How often pass we by the works of God Unnoticed, and forget his presence too! The sea, the sky, the plain, and mountain top, All these attract our gaze, and make us feel That mighty Being's Presence, who first formed, And still sustains the world in which we live. And yet the tiny moss, which the child's found, And so admires, to the reflecting tells The same great truth, too oft by man forgot! That God is everywhere, his power the same. Gaze at the moss' varied tints, and arm Thine eye with microscopic power. Behold With what a wondrous skill each leaf is made, Each stalk, a tree, rises above the mould; Forming, with countless more, a beauteous grove. Like mightier forests, wilted by the sun, And covered black with dust, it droops and dies. Refreshed and washed by showers it lifts its head, Expands its shrunken boughs, puts on fresh hues, As grateful for the timely-falling rain. Think you God's presence here is less displayed, Than in the forest of high towering oaks; Which have, for centuries, withstood the storms? That less than they, it needs the Maker's care? Who scattered on the rock its dust-like seed, Preparing thus the way for giant pines, And mighty oaks to lift their forms on high? Who hid the mosses 'neath the polar snow, To feed the reindeer through the winter months, Or save the life of far-adventuring man? To humblest things the highest are allied; And the low moss, on which man careless treads, Hath with the noblest forms a unity; And like them, too, an end for which twas made. Scattered o'er all the earth the mosses grow, On loftiest mountain and in deepest glen, In gloomy forest and in open plain; That no where man may come, and look around, Without a witness of God's care and love. Poem No. 197; c. 8 March 1859 On the Bunyan Tableau Behold, O Christian! to the life displayed The pilgrim's progress through this evil world; The many foes by which he is delayed, Apollyon's fiery darts against him hurled, The vain allurements of the city spread Like fowler's net to take him in their snare, Its riches and its pomps, to which are wed The souls of men; the castle of Despair With dungeon deep, and Error's fatal hill. And friends behold, who help the pilgrim here, And arm him 'gainst his foes with heavenly skill; Fair visions too his fainting spirit cheer, The land of Beulah, and the city bright To which he goes, revealed to human sight! Poem No. 65; c. March 1859 The Lament Of The Flowers I looked to find Spring's early flowers, In spots where they were wont to bloom; But they had perished in their bowers, The haunts they loved had proved their tomb! The alder and the laurel green, Which sheltered them, had shared their fate; And but the blackened ground was seen, Where hid their swelling buds of late. From the bewildered, homeless bird, Whose half-built nest the flame destroys; A low complaint of wrong I heard, Against the thoughtless, ruthless boys. Sadly I heard its notes complain, And ask the young its haunts to spare; Prophetic seemed the sorrowing strain, Sung o'er its home, but late so fair! âNo more, with hues like ocean shell, The delicate wind-flower here shall blow; The spot that loved its form so well Shall ne'er again its beauty know.â âOr, if it bloom, like some pale ghost, Twill haunt the black and shadeless dell, Where once it bloomed a numerous host, Of its once pleasant bowers to tell.â âAnd coming years no more shall find The laurel green upon the hills; The frequent fire leaves naught behind, But e'en the very roots it kills.â âNo more, upon the turnpike's side, The rose shall shed its sweet perfume; The traveller's joy, the summer's pride, Will share with them a common doom.â âNo more shall these, returning, fling Round Childhood's home a heavenly charm; With song of bird, in early Spring, To glad the heart, and save from harm.â Poem No. 243; May 1859 The Voice In The Poplars A spirit in the tree top breathes, Familiar to my ear; I hear a sound amid'st its leaves, My childhood loved to hear; A rustling in the poplar tall, Which bends with every blast; So to my soul its murmurings call, From out the silent past! They tell in many an answering tone, As in my childhood's hour, Of things, to gross, dull minds unknown, Of a mysterious Power; That with the soul, by speechless things, Doth often converse hold; And lessons to the spirit brings, Which books have never told. For, written on each tree that grows, The story of its birth; When perfect from God's hand it rose Upon the new made earth. And when the stormy wind doth move, Or gentle zephyr fan; It telleth still of Eden's grove To listening ear of man. Poem No. 20; c. 13 August 1859 How Faith Comes Faith in the Lord how can I find? I hear you say. Alas so blind! Dost thou not see the works He's made, And all the glory there displayed; The glory of the morning hour, And that which decks the lowly flower? Dost thou not of the Savior read, His wondrous words, His every deed, An act of pure and holy love, To lift the earth-bound soul above. And see'st thou not the heavenly light, That's risen on the ancient night; Which banishes from death its gloom, And shows the world beyond the tomb? Faith comes from sight, when clear and true, It comes, says Paul, from hearing too, It comes from doing too the Word, Obeying what we've seen and heard; From humble toil, self-sacrifice, When man his lower self denies; And follows Him, who died to save, And his own life for others gave. Poem No. 110; c. 22 October 1859 The Poet As one who 'midst a choir alone doth sing, When voices harsh fill all his soul with pain, So that from even a note he would refrain, And flee away as with a dove's swift wing, Yet for Religion's sake you see him stay, And try to raise her service what he may;â So doth the Poet live amidst his age! Though at the first his lyre he scarce can hear, He does not drown its discords in his rage, Nor fly where they will not offend his ear; But for their very sakes who spoil his songs, His heaven-taught strain he more and more prolongs; Till one by one they with his paean blend, And all in one harmonious concert end. Poem No. 55; c. December 1859 The Set Times, And The Boundaries of Nations, Appointed By God Not of self-will are States &amp; Nations born; Their times &amp; bounds are fixed by God's decree; Thus were these States from parent Country torn, And, at his Word, became forever free. To seek the Lord, to do his righteous will, For this He prospered them in low estate; And, that He might his purposes fulfil, Amidst earth's mightiest Kingdoms made them great. But hidden oft His purpose from our eyes, As to the people &amp; the kings of old, To whom He sent his teachers, prophets wise By whom their righteous downfall He foretold; Would, O my Country! thou their fate might'st read, And even now their prophets' warnings heed! Poem No. 366; February 1860 or 1861 The Cemetery of Harmony Grove Well is this place a cemetery called; For here do we unto the earth commit, With hope in Christ, the forms of those we love; And say our friends have fallen asleep in Him, To wait, with us, his Coming, long foretold. So named they first the spot where martyrs slept, And saints whose faith had overcome the world; To show that death o'er them had lost his power. Here once the sower came, and sowed his seed, And watched the springing of the new green blade, So different from the mouldering form below, And pondered on the lesson Nature taught. For she, with faithful trust, restores the grain, Which man unto her bosom doth commit; Yet tells him not, that he shall live again; Or only in dim type obscurely speaks. She makes but credible, what God reveals. By revelation taught we clearly see The hidden meaning of her countless forms, Differing in glory on the earth, in heaven; And, by analogy, the springing grain Doth teach us of the body that shall be, The spiritual body, that shall this succeed; For reason's powers are limited and weak, Nor fully can the mystery comprehend. Earth can restore but that which is her own, Give back the grain again an hundred fold, Perpetuate her kinds, beasts, insects, birds, The individual in the species lost. Christ is the Resurrection, and the Life; And, at his Coming, them who sleep shall bring. With the same beauty do the flowers return, And with like foliage is the tree new clothed; But with more glorious bodies shall they come, Whose life on earth was hid with Christ in God; When He, who is our Life and Hope, appears. E'en now are earth and man, though mortal, touched With foregleams of the bright, immortal dawn. They followed not myths cunningly devised, Who have proclaimed the Coming of the Lord; For they beheld his glory on the mount, And heard the voice, which came to him from heaven. No more, as once, neglected and forgot, A source of superstitious fears to all, The resting place of those we mourn remains. Planted with trees, vocal with songs of birds, Whose music morn and eve fills all the grove; Adorned with flowers of every hue and kind, With cheerful hopes we consecrate the grave. Engraved on humble stone, or splendid tomb, The holy texts of scripture meet the eye; Or words of poet speaking heart to heart, That tell men of a higher life to come. While thus I tread these much frequented paths, And hold communion with the loved and mourned; The mystic veil between us thinner grows, And nearer seems the time, when Christ shall come To abolish death, and triumph o'er the grave. Poem No. 770; c. February 1860 Preparation for Life's Voyage Prepared, the sailor o'er the ocean sails; His ship is strong, and skillful are the crew; Watchful his glance to see what wind prevails, When to the breeze he spreads his canvass new; With chart and compass he no danger fears From rock, or reef, or treacherous current strong; From clime to clime, and port to port he steers In his stout ship borne by the waves along. Why thoughtless then, O man, wilt thou embark Upon Life's sea, no chart or compass thine? There tempests oft prevail, and dangers dark Lie hid like rocks that lurk beneath the brine; And oft man's bark, with all its swelling pride, Sinks in the waves, or drives o'er ocean wide. Poem No. 402; c. 17 March 1860 The Slowness of Belief in a Spiritual World The astronomer with patient, searching gaze Doth with his tube the depths of space explore; Shows Neptune's orb, or, 'neath the solar blaze, Reveals a world by man unseen before. Justly the world rewards his arduous toil, And claims to share the glory of his fame; Beyond the boundaries of his native soil From land to land the breezes bear his name. But he who doth a Spirit-world reveal, Not far in space, but near to every soul; Which naught but mists of sense and sin conceal, (Would from men's sight those mists at length might roll!) He is with incredulity received, Or with a slow, reluctant faith believed. Poem No. 460; c. April 1860 Hymn The Dew 'Tis not the copious rains alone, Which bless the parched soil; The gentle dews that nightly fall Reward the sower's toil. Unseen, unheard the dews descend, Like slumber on the mind; And on the thirsty hills, and fields A blessing leave behind. In the cool stillness of the night The drooping plants revive, The grass and every tender herb With their sweet influence thrive. See, gathered on each pointed blade How bright the dew-drops shine! And learn in humble trusting faith To trace the Hand Divine. That, though no clouds their fulness drop In answer to our prayer; Still we may own that day by day Our God for us doth care. Poem No. 731; c. July 1860 The Triennial He reads in a book, he reads in a book, Many years have swiftly passed, Since the August morn, that saw him look For the page, where he was classed; He was then a youth, and his clear eye beamed, As he paused on each comrade's name; And visions arose, as he thought and dreamed Of their pathways to virtue and fame. This one shall soon win a poet's bays, And this in the senate be heard; And this one will walk in his own quiet ways, That as now he has always preferred; A fourth be a teacher and guide to the young, Another the priest of our God; Around each beloved name a glory was flung, That illumined the paths which they trod. But now he turns back on the Catalogue's page, Which shakes in his trembling hand, As he slowly reads, with the helps of age, The names of that youthful band; Not fifty years have come and gone, Since first the long column he read; Now, on the starred page, he stands almost alone, As he reads and communes with the dead. With those who remain he is walking there, Through the scene of their early days; Recalling the joys, in which each had a share, As they brighten in memory's rays; Though more of the dead, than the living, they know, As they sit in Old Harvard's high hall; Or muse through its shadowy precincts below, They sit and they talk with them all. Nor small is their pleasure, though saddened the while, This remnant from Time's tossing wave; Like mariners cast on some sea-beaten isle, Who see every where round them a grave; Each joys as he tells of his own favored lot, Points the rock, where he clung for his life; While their tears fall for those, who can ne'er be forgot, Who there entered with them on the strife. Still meet here, ye few, while the lamp of life burns, Where ye met at life's early hour; Where often so fondly the memory turns, As the spot of her strongest power; Here gladly she'll soothe your swift-flying days, With past thoughts of Friendship and Love; Till no more ye are found in the world's busy ways, But have joined your companions above. Poem No. 165; August 1860 Welcome Written for the Essex Institute Fair, Held at Salem Sept. 4th, 1860. We welcome to our Hall and Fair All who would aid in Learning's cause! The noble work we fain would share, Which man to clearer knowledge draws. With still increasing light it beams, As we the world around explore; From earth and sky its radiance streams, That all may see, believe, adore. The beast, the bird, the fish, the shell, The flower, the crystal from the mine, Have each some word of truth to tell Of the Creator's vast design. But oft, with uninstructed eye, And soul unmoved, on these we gaze; And e'en the glories of the sky No knowledge show, call forth no praise. From Learning's hall to Nature's page With more enlightened minds we turn; Delighted still, from youth to age, New charms to see, new truths to learn. As Nature, to her children all, Opens her realms of wonder wide; Aid us that Learning's sun-lit hall, To none who seek, may be denied. Poem No. 766; c. 4 September 1860 The Child's Answer Who made these flowers, I asked a child, So many and so fair? âGod,â she replied, âHe made them all, And for them all doth care.â But man, than child, less wise may be, Who proudly seeks to know The truths, which Faith, by humblest flower, To infant minds can show. Him doubts perplex. And oft he seeks By reasonings long to prove; What to the child so plain appears, God's being, and his love. It is not that all outward things Do not his power proclaim; But in ourselves the darkness is, Who cannot read his Name. There's not a star in heaven above, Nor flower beneath our feet; But doth to all men, everywhere, That glorious Name repeat. Oh may we have a humble mind, Their teachings to receive; And may we, like the little child, In God, in Christ believe! Poem No. 814; c. 15 September 1860 Freedom And Union By deeds not words we prove our inmost mind, For things, not names, we labor and contend; In noble souls the two are still combined, And each to each a nobleness they lend! Freedom and Union are not names, but things, By deeds our fathers proved for them their love; In vain with words like these the country rings, If to the things themselves we recreant prove. In this alone all patriots agree, To labor for their country's highest good; And, by the fruit it bears, to judge the tree, However party names are understood. 'Tis not the title that makes good the claim, But nobler deeds, which justify the name. Poem No. 85; September 1860 The Cross Raised on high, above the city, Oft I see the sacred cross; Telling of the Savior's sufferings, Borne for men with shame and loss! When amidst its streets I wander, And its tempting pleasures seek; From the cross a strength there cometh, And no longer I am weak. When I covet others' honors, Wish their wealth, or homes were mine; Then the cross uplifts my spirit, And no longer I repine. When I murmur faint, and weary, Grow impatient at my lot; Then I look upon the symbol, And my sufferings are forgot. When of good of men I labor, Yet for this I suffer wrong; Then the cross its lesson teaches, Then, though weak, I yet am strong. Then, the outward cross doth vanish, From my eye and from my thought; And, all glorified, my Savior To my mind again is brought! Not as when he bore his anguish, Hanging on the accursed tree; But, as raised above all passion, Doth the Savior come to me; And another life I enter, With its peace before unknown; And, with countless tribes and nations, Stand confessed before the throne. Poem No. 404; c. September 1860 On reading the Memorial of John White Browne Forgetful thou to manhood's years had'st grown, Thou knelt'st in Spring upon the grassy sod To greet the early The houstonia.Flower in fragrance blown, And own the presence of its Maker, God. Forgetful? No! but mindful rather thou Of what true manhood must forever be; Before each beauteous thing it loves to bow, With a child's faith, and child's humility; But, joined with these, a courage too was thine, In Freedom's cause, boldly to do and dare; Each worldly honor, for her sake, to resign, And with her humblest flower all things share; Nature, with early flower and falling leaf, Doth mourn a life, like thine, should be so brief! Poem No. 135; 25 October 1860 Hymn And God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes. Rev. xxi. 4. Not tears alone for natural grief Our God shall wipe away; To sinners too He sends relief, When unto Him they pray. We mourn the loss of dearest friends, For want, and woe, and pain; But still our God some comfort sends, And we rejoice again. But most we weep and mourn for Sin, Will God, our God, forgive; And purify the heart within, That we to Him may live? Shall we as sinners ever know, That we are all-forgiven? Shall Memory's page no record show, 'Gainst such as dwell in heaven? God wipes away the sinner's tears, Reveals a Father's love; And all our doubts and all our fears, But passing shadows prove. E'en Memory's self at length shall cease To bear one guilty stain, And naught but joy, and heavenly peace Within the soul remain. Poem No. 368; c. November 1860 One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever. Ecclesiastes 1:4. As is the sand upon the ocean's shore, So without number seems the human race; And to that number still are added more, As wave on wave each other onward chase. As are the drops of rain, that countless fall Upon the earth, or on the briny sea; So seem man's generations great and small, Those that have been, and those who yet shall be. As are the snow flakes fluttering on the air, Succeeded still by others thick and fast; So many souls the mortal image bear, That stand within the present, or the past. More than the ancient Preacher now we know, Though wiser he than all the sons of men; God, through his Son, the promise doth bestow, That all the sons of earth shall live again. Nor countless forms alone the earth doth hold, Which on it move, or in its bosom lie; As numberless the stars, which we behold, Which fill the spaces of the azure sky, So, we believe, unnumbered still in heaven Will be the forms, that meet our new-born sight; When to each soul a spotless robe is given To dwell forever in its cloudless light. Poem No. 54; c. 26 January 1861 What of Our Country? What of our Country? is the word, The word from all we meet; From young and old the question's heard, At home and in the street. What of our Country? War or peace? The question comes to all; Shall this our glorious Union cease, And into fragments fall? What of our country? Has the plan Of God been here achieved? Have we obtained the rights of Man, In which our sires believed? What of our Country? Shall her name, Glorious in every clime, Dishonored be? Or grow in fame Till the last hour of time? In vain we ask, in vain we peer Into the future dim; To God alone the vision's clear, We trust alone in Him! For us the present only is, Be strong, be true to-day; The future, the event is His, Whom worlds on worlds obey. Poem No. 779; c. 29 January 1861 The Hour Before the Dawn The darkest hour that falls upon the earth, Is that before the coming of the dawn; When light with darkness struggles for its birth, And help Divine for man seems oft withdrawn! In vain the eye would penetrate the gloom, And look beyond the darkness of the hour; To see of Wickedness the fated doom, Of Virtue's Kingdom come with mightier power. Thus when, amidst convulsive throes of old, Christ's Kingdom in its glory should appear; He the dark hour before the day foretold, In signs and wonders to his followers clear; And bade them earnest watch, and earnest pray, Until in splendor rose his peaceful day. Poem No. 481; February 1861 State Rights Wisely each state for its own rights contends; And jealous is of the whole Country's sway; From arbitrary power those rights defends, Nor tamely would a tyrant's will obey. But to itself, meanwhile, it false may prove, Seeking its own, its ease, its wealth, its power; Acknowledging no more the bond of love, Its Country's good, which was its nuptial dower. Our Country's good! Ah, here we all have erred, Unmindful of her good and noble fame; Each state its separate interest has preferred, And gloried even in the Nation's shame; Nor seen, that what its greatness each may deem, Without the general good, is but a dream! Poem No. 830; c. 1 March 1861 The Rights of Man With narrow view each state its own would claim, Forgetful of the greater common good; Forgetful of its heritage of fame, When they the mightiest foe on earth withstood. The Rights of Man seem now a short-lived dream, An abstract good, an unsubstantial thing; Of boastful orators the annual theme, Or glory of which poets vainly sing. Thus we our selfish ends too oft pursue, Blinded by avarice, or lust of power; Seeking our own, yet to ourselves untrue, Unfaithful to our Country, and the hour; Nor know that in the nation's good each state, Whate'er it boasts, alone is truly great. Poem No. 838; c. 15 March 1861 A Longing For The Spring A longing for the Spring, Amidst the deepening snows; To hear again the sweet birds sing, My spirit often knows. For freedom and the joy That fill its happy hours; When pleasant thoughts the mind employ, And pleasant sights are ours. I see the pastures green, Where I am wont to stray; Where flowers of every hue are seen To bloom along my way. I follow on the brook, That prattles down the vale; And tells, to many a leafy nook, Its short and gladsome tale. The flower-crowned hill I see, Thick swamp and shady grove; And welcome hear from bush and tree, Where'er my footsteps rove. These haunt my memory still, With pictures of the past; And longings for the spring-time fill My soul at every blast. Poem No. 11; c. 29 March 1861 The Abolition Of Serfdom In Russia From the great, imperial city Has gone forth the fixed decree, That the Russian serf forever From oppression shall be free! Through a long, long night of bondage, He has felt the oppressor's rod; Bought and sold by haughty boyars, Held for life to till the sod. The increasing light of knowledge Still denied to heart and mind; He for ages has toiled onward To its cheering radiance blind. With a nature thus degraded, His own good he scarce has known; While, in lands by Freedom favored, Man to manhood's height has grown. But the day at length is dawning O'er the dark and frozen North; Now the trumpet's voice proclaimeth Man's true dignity and worth. That to all the right belongeth, To the strong and to the weak, To the noble, and the peasant, Knowledge, happiness to seek. Unto Russia's Czar be honor, For his brows the laurel twine; His a nobler crown and kingdom, Than the greatest of his line. Poem No. 142; c. 6 April 1861 Fear not: for they that are with us are more than they that are with them. 2 Kings 6:16. The wicked and the base do compass round The meek and humble in their righteous way, And, with fierce onset and the trumpet's sound, They seek the servants of the Lord to slay; They trust in wealth, or in the cruel sword, Vain idols that cannot defend, or save! They fear no threatenings of God's holy Word, But, trusting in themselves alone, are brave. But though no human help the righteous know, They fear not in the last, the trying hour; God, through his gracious love, to them doth show The unseen hosts and ensigns of his power; Who compass them about on every side, In whose protection they may safe confide. Poem No. 594; c. April 1861 Hymn Nature's Sympathy with Freedom A sadder aspect wears the spring, Less beauteous bloom its early flowers, Less cheerily the gay birds sing, Within its fragrant budding bowers. The hills and fields are still the same, But o'er their green a cloud has past; From Southern skies swift-winged it came, And all the heavens were overcast! The tempest's wrath, the ocean's rage, Though terrible, are quickly o'er; Shall man a fiercer conflict wage, And Nature's short-lived strife deplore? Ah no! Though fierce his passions rise, To desolate her fair domain; Soon may the peaceful, cloudless skies Smile on our favored land again. More favored still;âfor Freedom then From Slavery's curse our land shall save, Acknowledged be the Rights of men, Where'er our Country's flag shall wave. Poem No. 19; 12 Aprilâ7 May 1861 Christ's Capture In The Garden A Paraphrase When shrouded by the darkness of the earth, And soon to pass away from human sight; Thus spake the Wisdom, born of heavenly birth, Which was before the world, of men the Light. âWhy come ye forth as 'gainst a thief, with swords, When daily in the Temple I have taught? Have ye not listened to God's gracious words, Which to a sinful world salvation brought? âWhy stretched ye forth no hands against me then, When, in your sight and hearing, there I stood? Was it because ye stood in fear of men? But thus it was to prove the Scriptures good. âThis is your hour! The covert gloom of night Is the fit time for violence and wrong; The evil hide them from the morning light, And, leagued with Darkness, only are they strong. âThe children of the Light do wisdom love, And gladly listen to her holy word; The evil hate the light, which doth reprove, And 'gainst the righteous draw the bloody sword.â Poem No. 793; c. May 1861 Song Words Of Love To A Parent Each word of love a child doth speak, It sows a flower, to bloom Along its aged parent's path, Descending to the tomb! No more may blush the summer's rose To glad their failing sight; Nor to the ravished sense, as once, Its fragrance give delight. But every word of love they hear Is treasured in the heart; A bloom, a fragrance there to shed, Which never can depart! Poem No. 104; c. 29 June 1861 The Comet Strange visitant! that burst'st upon our sight, And with thy meteor-splendors fill'st the sky; From what far distant bourn, what starless night, Com'st thou, in terror clad, to every eye! Amidst the stars' unquenched, eternal fires, I see thee like some mighty warrior burn; Who, with his flaming sword upraised, aspires A seat among their peaceful spheres to earn. But vain the strife! Soon in the depths of space Thou'lt vanish, and thy place no more be found! The astronomer thy path may never trace, Nor know the years of thine appointed round; While moving on, in its benignant sphere, Nightly each star the heart of man doth cheer. Poem No. 445; c. 13 July 1861 Each Day a Prophecy What image of a higher, holier day Does each returning sun earth's children bring? Bright as o'er land and sea he takes his way, He seems the herald of the heavenly King; Before him fly the murky shades of night, That veil from sight earth's plains and mountains high; The sea's thick rolling vapors take their flight, And vanish upward in the kindling sky. I gaze upon the scene, and from within A light too streams upon the suffering earth; I see the promised day of God begin, And all earth's children share the second birth; And to my mind the image doth unfold Of Life and Joy and Peace so long foretold. Poem No. 773; c. July 1861 The Influence Of The Night on Faith And Imagination The day with well-known duties now is o'er; No more, by its clear light, each thing I see Distinct and plain to sight, or reason's power. As fade familiar objects on my sight, And on my ear the sounds of labor cease, The higher faculties assert their power, Imagination and adoring faith. And now the night has come, mysterious night! To call away my spirit from the earth, That faith may quickened be in things unseen. With mind no longer bent on daily tasks, Or fixed on earth with its brief term of years; Upward I gaze, and feel my soul expand, And to its native height majestic tower. Akin to mystery is the soul of man, And in the stars he feels that mystery solved. Not in the narrow space, which we call life, I feel the boundaries of my being end; To those vast cycles is my soul allied, Which yonder orbs in mystic circles trace. To me is given to call them each by name, And, in the time to come, familiar grow With all their hosts, as now with flowers of earth. No more my mind, to one small orb confined, Narrows its view; but flies from world to world, From sun to sun, swifter than morning light. Lift up your eyes, ye denizens of earth! And raise your thoughts above its narrow sphere. Let yonder countless stars a lesson teach. Think not to earth, and earth alone, confined This mortal race, with its attendant forms; But, worthier thought, to each revolving sphere Its own peculiar habitants assigned, With varying life, to suit each changing scene. Perhaps in yon fair planet-world there dwells A happier race, though mortal, than on earth; Where death is but a change to higher life, Without its sufferings and without its fears. There war may be unknown, and men in peace And friendly intercourse united live. To them may come, as once to men on earth, Angels from higher spheres to bring them gifts; To mingle freely in their peaceful homes, And teach them of the Father's boundless love. Thus as I muse, my faith doth stronger grow; Imagination soars with loftier flight; And, as the parched plant beneath the dews, So is my spirit by the night restored. Poem No. 487; c. August 1861 Sunset in Derby's Woods This a fitting scene would prove For the Painter's beauteous art, Scenes like this the Poets love, Speaking to the eye and heart. Winding river here I see, Fields and woods on either hand; From all noise the place is free, As for quiet musings planned. Nature here asserts her power O'er the freed and grateful soul! Swiftly flies the sunset hour, 'Neath her gentle, sweet control. Not alone I seem to be, While she ministers around; Though no human form I see, Hear no voice of mortal sound. As I turn to leave the spot, Still it doth my vision fill; It can never be forgot, Woods, and stream, and lofty hill. Lighted oft by Memory's ray, They no more can fade from sight; Like the hues of dying day, Quickly changing into night. Poem No. 653; c. 6 September 1861 My People are destroyed for lack of Knowledge. âHosea 4:6. For lack of Knowledge do my people die! No fell diseases in our land abound, No pestilential vapors fill the sky, No drought, or barrenness has cursed the ground; The harvest-fields are white on every side, For God has given to all with liberal hand; To none His sun and rain has He denied, But with abundance blessed our fruitful land. But Him, who gives to all, they have not known! His truth, his mercy, and unfailing love; Who sends not on one favored race alone, His gifts and mercies from the heavens above; Therefore the land doth mourn, and, day by day, War wastes our fields, and doth the people slay! Poem No. 131; c. 21 September 1861 Autumn Flowers Still blooming on, when Summer-flowers all fade, The golden rods and asters fill the glade; The tokens they of an Exhaustless Love, That ever to the end doth constant prove. To one fair tribe another still succeeds, As still the heart new forms of beauty needs; Till these, bright children of the waning year! Its latest born have come our souls to cheer. They glance upon us from their fringed eyes, And to their look our own in love replies; Within our hearts we find for them a place, As for the flowers, which early Spring-time grace. Despond not traveller! on life's lengthened way, When all thy early friends have passed away; Say not, âNo more the beautiful doth live, And to the earth a bloom and fragrance give.â To every season has our Father given Some tokens of his love to us from heaven; Nor leaves us here, uncheered, to walk alone, When all we loved and prized, in youth, has gone. Let but thy heart go forth to all around, Still by thy side the beautiful is found; Along thy path the Autumn flowers shall smile, And to its close life's pilgrimage beguile. Poem No. 437; 26 September 1861 Hymn From out its large estate, Little the world will give; The rich, the powerful, and the great, Care not that thou shouldst live. The world doth love its own, Its ways, its wealth, its pride; 'Twill leave thee weak and poor alone, Nor care though thou hadst died. Then look unto the Lord, And trust his gracious care; Believe the promise of his Word, He, pitying, hears thy prayer. He shall thy wants supply, Who gives to all their food; Nor, to the thankless, doth deny Each needed earthly good. Poem No. 140; c. 26 September 1861 The Poet's Plea Why sing, amidst the strife which reigns around? Will men the poet's heart-felt music hear? Or will they heed the Gospel's peaceful sound, And sheathe the sword, and break the threatening spear? Ah no, yet unsubdued men's passions rage! The never-ceasing conflict born within, Or outward foes, their energies engage, O'er which they strive the victory to win. But still the poet midst the tumult sings, Hoping from war and strife men's thoughts to gain; He touches with diviner skill the strings, And from his harp there breathes a holier strain; Such as the watchful shepherds wondering heard, When the still night by angels' lyres was stirred! Continued That strain harmonious through the war-worn earth Shall yet be heard, and every nation move; It tells the glories of the heavenly birth, Heroic deeds of Faith and Christian Love. O'er the wild tumults of the world it steals, Calming the fury of its outward strife; A higher, holier conflict it reveals; The victory and the crown, Eternal Life! The warrior hears, and drops his blood-stained sword, No more with war's fierce flames his bosom burns; Man in God's image is once more restored, The golden age of Peace and Love returns; And Nature with new beauty decks her bowers, Scattering with lavish hand her fruits and flowers. Poem No. 826; October 1861 On The Completion Of The Pacific Telegraph Swift to the western bounds of this wide land, Swifter than light, the Electric Message flies; The continent is in a moment spanned, And furthest West to furthest East replies. While War asunder drives the nearest states, And doth to them all intercourse deny, Science new bonds of Union still creates, And the most distant brings forever nigh! I hail this omen for our Country's cause; For it the stars do in their courses fight! In vain men strive against the eternal laws Of Peace, and Liberty, and Social Right; Rebel against the light; and hope to stay The dawn on earth of Freedom's perfect day. Poem No. 454; c. 5 November 1861 On the First Church Built by the Puritans in 1634. Standing on the estate of David Nichols, Esq, in the rear of Boston street. Still may it stand! For Time himself has spared, As if by miracle, the humble fane, In which our fathers worshipped; when they dared To seek Religious Freedom o'er the main. Though poor and perishing unto the sight, A glory seems to rest upon the place; Its walls and roof are lit with heavenly light, While we its history and purpose trace. Their simple worship seems again restored, Again we hear the hymn, the heart-felt prayer, With them we listen to the preached Word, And in each hallowed rite and service share; Long as a sacred Relic, may we hold The Church our fathers built to God of old. Poem No. 439; c. 26 November 1861 The Barque Aurelia of Boston The old Barque's picture we took from the wall, In which I sailed over the sea; Which our sailor-boy days did so brightly recall To my boyhood's Rev. William Hoopercompanion, and me. With our fathers once more we sailed over the main, From country to country to roam; New knowledge of earth, and its nations to gain, Yet never forgetful of home. The ocean, so grand in its aspect &amp; form, Seemed again on our vision to rise; By night and by day, in calm and in storm, As its wonders first greeted our eyes. The sailors' quaint speech, and their strange dress, and ways, Again to my fancy appeared; Yet their honest, kind hearts I remember to praise, For to them was the ship's boy endeared. And the New Orleans.port where we lay, and the winter time spent, Where first our acquaintance began; What pleasure has time to those early days lent, Since each has become a grown man! The river, the shipping, the flat boats we view, Slaves, and Indians we ne'er saw before; At every turn we see something new, As the city again we explore. And with us was one, whom our hearts loved so well, Long since from the earth passed away; How oft of his looks does memory tell, Board the barque, or at school, or at play! With him too have gone, to the fair world above, Our fathers, the seamen we knew; Where cherished for aye are friendships, and love, Which on earth have proved faithful and true. Poem No. 535; 1861? The traveller At The Depot The traveller at the depot waiting stands, Impatient for the coming of the train; The night is hastening on, the hour demands That he the shelter of his home shall gain. We, too, are travellers here! But short our stay, And swiftly flies for each the allotted hour; Swift as declines the sun of winter's day, Or fades the petals of the summer's flower! Why do we then our short probation spend, Unmindful of the night which hastens on; Unmindful of the soul's true goal, and end; Until our days and years are fled and gone; And we no nearer to our heavenly home, Though the last hour for us on earth has come? Poem No. 584; c. II January 1862 Salvation Is Of The Lord The Book of Jonah ii.9. âSleeper, arise and call upon thy God!â The master to the sleeping prophet cried; As to and fro with anxious fear he trod, And vainly every art for safety tried. E'en Superstition owns a Higher Power, And doth upon its gods in trouble call; When mighty tempests rise, in danger's hour, It doth before its idols prostrate fall. And shall not we, whom Faith's bright beams illume, Who to the One True God our worship pay, Call on his Name, amid the deepening gloom, Bow at his altars, at his footstool pray? Christians, arise, and call upon your God, Who o'er the nation lifts his chastening rod! Poem No. 424; c. January 1862 The Newspaper In this one sheet, how much for thought profound, How much for feeling deep doth meet the eye! Here man's decease, here empire's fate is found, And yet, with careless glance, we pass them by! Perchance, upon one page enough we find, On which through a long life we well might muse; But oft with husks we fill the hungry mind, When men the gifts of speech, and thought abuse. Not in the many words, or books we read, Is knowledge gained of Nature, or of man; Oft, in a single word, lies wrapt the seed Of changes vast, would we its meaning scan; But lacking still the wisdom to be wise, The Truth we seek is hidden from our eyes. Poem No. 301; c. 22 February 1862 E Pluribus Unum A higher thought than fills the narrow mind Of selfish States, that seek some private end; Did once these States with us together bind, And to the Union power and glory lend. 'Twas Liberty which made us great and free, A nation midst the nations of the earth; A higher hope, a nobler unity, Gave to each State a new, diviner birth! That thought still lives, and still asserts its power O'er selfish pride, and every hateful foe; It guards our country in its evil hour, And doth new life and energy bestow; Will with a higher Freedom lead us on, And as of old, of Many make us One. Poem No. 9; c. 12 April 1862 Song I sought the flowers, but o'er them lay Piled deep the frozen snow; They felt not there the warm sun's ray, Nor heard the soft winds blow. Again I came; the snow-bank then Had melted from the earth; But vainly still I sought the glen, To hail the flower's new birth. With faithless heart did I repeat My visit to their bowers; When lo! in beauty at my feet, Bloomed bright Spring's earliest flowers! Poem No. 273; c. 2 May 1862 This Mortal Shall put on Immortality The mortal body quickly dies, Struck by disease and pain; In vain we gaze, our longing eyes Behold it not again. 'Tis but a tent, a house of clay, Where for a time we dwell; For years, or for a single day No one of us can tell. Mysterious union of the soul, Of spirit with the clod; One being, Man, a perfect whole The image of his God! O keep that image pure and bright Of body and of mind, And keep the glory still in sight, For which it was designed. Since not for suffering, or disease, God formed us of the dust; But that we might our Maker please, And place in Him our trust. Who through his Son the promise gave, That man shall never die; But triumph o'er the opening grave In immortality! Poem No. 656; c. 24 May 1862 Hymn The Spirit Itself Maketh Intercession For Us The Spirit doth our weakness aid, When thought, and utterance fail; When all our words can say is said, Its sighs and groans avail. They reach the ear of God on high, Who doth the heart discern; He hears the feeblest sufferer's cry, And swift to him doth turn. Oh faint not, then, when all thy might Of thought, and word is gone; God's help shall make thy burden light, Thou art not, then, alone. His Spirit doth within thee dwell, To comfort, and console; No tongue the love, and peace can tell, It brings unto the soul! And though no voice of man makes known The prayer, which then we pray; Yet God doth hear each sigh and groan, And knows what we would say. Poem No. 571; c. May 1862 The Elm Seed Scattered, with every breeze, I see them fly This way and that upon the Summer air; Trodden to dust beneath our feet they lie, Yet not without the great Creator's care! Some single seed his Providence directs, That Providence, which guards &amp; governs all; The tiny germ through Winter it protects, And, in the Spring-time, from its grave will call. No more a seed; but now a growing tree, Though scarce its slender form at first is seen; Still, nourished &amp; sustained, in time 'twill be A mighty elm; from Summer's suns a screen To man and beast, that seek its friendly shade; And birds, that, in its boughs, their nests have made. Poem No. 411; c. 17 June 1862 The Cause The body sick, the cause we seek to find, In head, or limb, or ever-beating heart; Or in the secret workings of the mind, Nor rest till we have found the suffering part. Once found, we use our utmost power and skill The cause itself of suffering to remove; Nor do we bear a single pain, or ill, Till every healing remedy we prove. And why should Nations mighty ills endure, War's horrid scourge, and Slavery's ancient wrong, Nor seek to find their cause? or found, to cure? But still from age to age their guilt prolong; Till by some sudden shock, or slow decay, Their greatness, like a shadow, pass away! Poem No. 468; June 1862 Outward Conquests Not Enough 'Tis not enough to overcome with arms,â These may the body, not the mind subdue; A mightier foe, within, the spirit harms, Than that the armed warrior ever knew. Here Ignorance and Error still prolong Their ancient rule, and dread the coming light; And, joined with them, Ambition, Pride, and Wrong Muster their hosts, and, leagued with darkness, fight. These not by carnal weapons are o'erthrown, But by the power of light, and truth, and love; Weapons the warrior's hands have never known, Sent from the armory of God above; Boldness to speak, the quick and powerful Word, That sharper is than his two-edged sword! Poem No. 729; c. July 1862 Ship Rock With a sudden, sweet surprise Burst the prospect on our eyes; Far the city's spires are seen, Hills, and fields, and woods between. Farther still, the ocean blue Fitly bounds the charming view; Where, on the horizon clear, Noble ships their courses steer. By the pond, beneath the hill, Silent stands the noisy mill; While the brook with laugh and song Through the meadow glides along. Science may thy birth explore, On the far-off Arctic shore; And thy various wanderings show, In the ages long ago;â With more interest here I trace Backward my own name and race; From thy top the scene behold, Where they lived and toiled of old. Here the wooded fields they cleared, And their humble homesteads reared; Here they planted, gathered here Harvests ripe from year to year. Here they worshipped Him, whose word, In their father-land, they heard; Him, who, o'er the ocean wide, Was their Hope, their Strength, their Guide. Here, in sweet and holy trust, They committed dust to dust; Minding where the soul's conveyed, More than where the body's laid. Still their orchard-lot I see, Here and there a moss-grown tree; Here their dwelling's site is known, Now by shrubs and vines o'ergrown. Sacred is this spot to me, Rock, and brook, and lofty tree; For, amid the scenes I tread, Rests the dust of kindred dead! Poem No. 831; c. 15 July 1862 The Light Of Freedom Necessary To National Progress When sets the sun, the traveller waits for light, Ere he his dangerous journey shall renew; Vain in the forest dark his sharpest sight, Where moon and stars alike are hid from view. The sun returns; again he onward goes, Its light reveals all objects to his eyes; He fears no danger now, nor lurking foes, His path all plain and bright before him lies. Frail Freedom's sun for us has hid its beams, The moon and stars have e'en their light withdrawn; Then let us wait, till once again it gleams Upon the mountain tops, and its bright dawn Shall the dark valleys fill with cheerful day; Then like the traveller safe pursue our way. Poem No. 792; September 1862 Ode to Freedom Freedom a fortress firm shall stand, No foes combined can take; Though cannon roar by sea and land, Its walls no power can shake; For it is founded on the rock, On which our fathers stood; Firm as the cliffs, that meet the shock Of ocean's angry flood. Proud Slavery's hosts inspire no fear, Though state on state conspire, To compass her with sword and spear, And hurl their bolts of fire; Though 'gainst her Capital are led Confederate armies on, Dishonoring the glorious dead, The name of Washington! Once honored men, now traitors grown, Found faithless at their post; No more their fathers' virtues known, Lead on the rebel host. In vain; for Washington still lives, Though sleeps his noble form; And to his sons the courage gives To meet the battle's storm. And once again, through all the land, Freedom her trumpet blows; To call her sons, on every hand, To meet their Country's foes. Poem No. 138; 19 September 1862 Philanthropy Before Nationality Upon the Rights of Man, at first, was built This free Republic, which our fathers planned; For these, at first, their precious blood they spilt, Though they its meaning failed to understand. But wider still expands their mighty thought, Raising from bondage e'en a subject race; What to themselves, at first, but freedom brought, Gives to the slave at length a name, and place! But still through blood and strife the boon we gain Against Ambition, Pride, and lust of Power; Which on man's limbs would rivet still the chain, When long ago has struck the appointed hour; And Liberty proclaims throughout the earth, That all are free and equal in their birth. Poem No. 755; c. 20 September 1862 The King's Arm Chair Steep cliff, round which a child I played, Or climbed to view the prospect o'er; Where hour by hour I frequent stayed; Thou wear'st not now thy look of yore! For man, by many a blast, has torn Thy hoary moss-grown front away; And at thy feet the fragments borne, Like some vast ruin strew the way. But still, as in that day, I see Thy bold steep forehead gainst the sky; When round thy base I climbed in glee, Till gained the lofty summit high. There, seated in the King's arm chair, I loved the landscape round to view; The busy streets and houses fair, The harbor with its waters blue. Before me spread the pastures green, With hills and meadows far away; Seaward the white-winged ships were seen, Bound to their ports along the bay. Beneath, I watched the living tide, Swift hurrying on with ceaseless flow, Along the smooth-worn turnpike wide, And round thy jutting base below. The wagon, chaise, or crowded stage, By turns I watched as they came by, The weary traveller bent with age, Glad from the hill the town to spy. Each hastening on with various mind, Some far o'er land and sea to roam, Sad for the friends they'd left behind; While others joyed to reach their home. By day, by night, the stream flowed on, Like a full river to the sea; Long since the lengthening train has gone, A picture now of Memory! Whose power restores the past again, The summer days, the golden flowers; To soothe stern manhood's toil, or pain, Or deck for age its leafless bowers. In vain would man thy form destroy, Or level thee e'en with the ground; I see thee still, as when a boy, And from the Arm Chair gaze around. Poem No. 409â434; October 1862 The Falling Leaf Fall, yellow leaf, for thy brief work is done! The work for which thy beauteous form was made; No more thou'lt glisten in the morning sun, No more thou'lt darken with the evening shade. Thy work is done! No more the parent tree Shall need thy aid, for winter-time is near; No more upon its boughs thy form we'll see, Through the long winter months to charm and cheer. But though thy work is done, to outward sight, And thou art trodden 'neath the feet of men; Still to the memory thou shalt bring delight, And in thy beauty seem to live again. Thy work can never cease, while thought shall bring Some pleasant memories of days gone by; When wandering in the woods, in early spring, Thy brilliant green first caught the admiring eye. Or when, in Summer, from the glare and heat We've sought the shelter of the quiet grove; And found, beneath its shade, a cool retreat, To pass the sultry hours with friends we love. Or when, in Autumn, midst her changing bowers, I mused upon the lessons, which they taught; Forgetful of the swiftly passing hours, Lost in a dream of sweet, yet solemn thought. Thy work shall never cease, while thou shalt be A thought the springs of memory to controul, A power the mind of man from sense to free, A joy and teaching to the deathless soul! Poem No. 111; c. 8 November 1862 National Unity A nobler unity, than that which came From out the conflict of our sires of old, Which gave to us throughout the world a name Shall we, our trials past, at length behold; A unity of Justice and of Power, As theirs of Freedom from a foreign foe; Through the dark clouds, that o'er the nation lower, We see its rising sun, its morning glow. No more shall party spirit rule the land, But One Great Thought inspire each freeman's breast, The rock on which alone our cause can stand, The Love of Man and Justice for the oppressed. Arise, O sun of Freedom to restore Their rights to all! Arise! and set no more! Poem No. 16; c. 15 November 1862 Faith In Time Of War I read of battles, and my faith grows weak; Does God look down on us with pitying eye? With loving care each day his children seek? I ask, but hear no voice to mine reply! When tens and hundreds dying strew the plain, What thought, I ask, is there for one alone? Heeds He the single sufferer's short, sharp pain? Hears He amidst the shouts his dying groan? Ah faithless heart! No one forsaken is, Each soul of man is his perpetual care; Living, or dying we are ever His, Whose tender mercies all his creatures share; Who, though the sword may slay, has power to save; And gives to man the victory o'er the grave! Poem No. 252; c. 22 November 1862 Hymn The Light of Life The Light of Life! O blessed words, To him, who midst the darkness lives; To every son of Adam's race, What joy, what hope, the promise gives! As to the man of old, born blind, But whom the Savior made to see; So do the precious words he spake Bring life, and light, and hope to me. No doubt obscures his meaning clear, Who miracles of healing wrought; To show, e'en to the earthly mind, From whence the doctrine he had brought. They speak of Him, who came from God; To tell men of the Father's love; To lead them through earth's sin, and strife, To their bright home in heaven above. Who follows Him, no more shall walk In Error's maze, or Death's dark night; But, e'en amidst their gloomy shades, Shall have within the Life, the Light. And when no more the paths he treads Of suffering, and of trial here; The Light of Life, on earth he saw, Shall greet him in a higher sphere. Poem No. 520; c. November 1862 Man's Heart Prophesieth Of Peace A sad confession from the heart of man It is, that War, dark hateful War, must be; That ever thus, e'en since the world began, Has been on earth the dire necessity! Behold, he says, the truth on History's page, Written in blood upon her lengthening scroll; The warrior's wreaths still green from age to age, And warlike glory still man's highest goal. But deeper look, O man, into thy heart, And Peace, a mightier need thou there shalt see; As yet thou know'st thy nature but in part, What thou hast been, but not what thou shalt be! And read the promise of God's holy Word, That nations shall no more lift up the sword. Poem No. 17; c. January 1863 Hymn The New Life of Humanity What Life is that, which, like the Spring, Now breathes o'er land and sea? Which doth new life to nations bring, To all humanity? Is it the life which, year by year, Calls forth the same fair flowers; So soon, alas, to disappear From out their summer bowers? The same bright birds calls forth again, With songs to cheer the grove; So soon, alas, to cease their strain, And distant far to rove? No: 'tis a life yet more divine, To humbler things unknown; Which nature, time cannot confine, 'Tis felt by man alone. More quickening than the vernal wind, Like mighty poets' lyre; That stirs the hearts of all his kind To something nobler higher; To nobler Freedom, purer Love, To perfect lasting Peace; Till to these thoughts men faithful prove, And wars forever cease. Poem No. 777; c. 4 April 1863 The Statue of Flora, On the grounds of R. Brookhouse Esq, Washington Street. Still gazing on thy wreath of carved flowers, A sight of beauty to the passing throng! Thou tellest of the Summer's blooming bowers, As to the mart, or court they haste along. And though perchance absorbed in thoughts of gain, But few admire thy flowers, or form of grace; Yet not upon the street thou standst in vain! Still on some heart thou may'st thine image trace, Recalling to the mind youth's early day; When hills and fields so oft he wandered o'er, When Nature o'er his soul acquired her sway, And every scene bright hues of beauty wore; And the stern man was once a playful boy, Whom e'en the smallest flower could thrill with joy! Poem No. 438; c. 28 April 1863 Hymn Sung At the Unitarian Festival, in Faneuil Hall, May 26?? 1863 Amidst the memories of the past, And cherished hopes sublime; Whose glorious record shall outlast The fading scroll of time; We meet each other's hearts to cheer, Sweet friendships to renew; To serve the Faith we hold so dear, Faith of the brave and true! The faith, that doth the power control Of foes without, within; And gives the victory to the soul O'er evil, death, and sin: Which, to the wounded, brings relief, And soothes the sufferer's pain; And doth the mourner's secret grief, With heavenly hopes, sustain. The faith that, on the cloud of War, Beholds the bow of Peace; Which sees Christ's triumph from afar, When Wrong and War shall cease. Poem No. 37â42; c. 26 May 1863 The Tree of Liberty As to the fruitful tree, which, in the Spring, Puts forth its fresh, green leaves, and blossoms red, The canker-worm doth desolation bring, And, like a fire, o'er all its branches spread;â E'en thus, fair Liberty, thy tree doth stand! Which at the first, did leaves and blossoms hold, And with its boughs o'ershadowed all the land; No more with verdure clad, as seen of old! But from neglect, from want of care and toil, When now the harvest time was drawing near, Become of basest men the prey and spoil; Who blighted have the promise of the year; And would the tree, which filled the earth with joy, As well as its fair fruits, at once destroy! Poem No. 58; c. 4 July 1863 Hymn Our Country's Dead They live to God, they live to God, Though gone from human sight! The good and brave, who left their homes To battle for the right. To Thee, O God, they still live on, Though ceased their mortal strife; And wait the triumph of the Cause, More dear to them than life. In sight of men they seem to die, And perish from the earth; But Thou dost give them even here, A new, immortal birth. Though chastened for a little time, Thou dost reward their pain; To die, to suffer for the right, Is e'en on earth to gain. For to their Country still they live, And, on her roll of fame, Recorded shall forever stand Each brave, and honored name! Poem No. 644; c. 1 August 1863 The Intuitions Of The Soul In every soul is born some thought of God, Of Beauty, or of Wisdom, Power, or Love; No one so grovelling on the earth has trod, But sought on sun-bright wings to soar above. For man in God's own image first was made, And dimly in himself these thoughts beholds; The same in Nature too he sees displayed, As she to him her glorious book unfolds. Thus ever upward doth our being tend, As we more clearly these great thoughts discern; And ask of God his heavenly grace to lend, That we as children all the truth may learn; That in our souls, unclouded and divine, The Life, the Light of men, may ever shine! Poem No. 298; c. August 1863 Still a Day To Live Still a day to live, still a day to live, The thought to my mind doth wisdom give; For what, in a day, may not be done? What may not be lost? what may not be won? In a day we may turn from the evil away, Resist the temptations, that lead us astray; In a day we may goodness forever secure, And thus our high calling of God may make sure. As bright from the east upriseth the sun, Let the morning with prayer and with praise be begun; Commune with thy Maker, and ask for his care, He hears, and will bless thy heart-spoken prayer. In the hours of thy business, thy pleasure, thy rest, Let the thought of his Presence on all be impressed; 'Twill strengthen for toil and thy pleasures make pure, And give thee the riches that ever endure. Each hour heed the voice that to duty may call, Though that duty to thee seem but trivial, or small; Each deed, timely done, to remembrance how sweet! Be quick, for the moment of action is fleet. For the night quickly cometh, when labor is o'er, And the sun at his rising shall see us no more; When fruitful, or faithless, no more we can say, âI have still, I have still yet to live for a day!â Poem No. 436; c. 19 September 1863 The Vagrant at the Church Door For years he had not seen his native placeâ For years he had not spoken to a friendâ For years he had not stood within a church; And now he linger'd in the dusky porch, And watch'd the congregation, one by one, Cheerfully enter, and devoutly bend In silent adoration. Many a face, Familiar long ago, glanced toward his ownâ Perhaps with wonder, for they knew him not, And he was sadly changed, since in this spot His happy boyhood swiftly pass'd away. Strange fascination! Now he needs must stay; For, in the echoes of the choir, he hears A melody familiar to long past years And sweet associations. Soon his tears Tell how the vagrant's spirit has been moved. All that he dreamt, all that he ever loved, All that youth's prophecy said âmight have been,â All the grim shadows of the wasted past, In dim procession moved before him now. The vagrant pass'd his fingers o'er his brow, And seemed bewilder'dâcrazedâuntil at last The dawning of a hopeful smile was seen Upon his face. The music of the psalm Died out in whispering echoes; and the voice, In earnest accents, of the village priest, Was heard in prayer. Once more the vagrant glanced Within the church, and then he entered in. Beneath a column's shadow sat entranced The poor world-weary man. A holy calm Encompass'd him, and made his heart rejoiceâ The past dissolved as though it had not been. The service ends. The rolling organ ceased. The verger came to where the vagrant sat Mute as a statue. âCome, my man,â said he, âThe church is closing; take your stick and hat, And let me shut the doors.â Then wonderingly The verger look'd again, and muttered low, âPoor soul! I knew him thirty years agoâ I little thought he would come here to die.â Poem No. 134; c. 26 September 1863 Health of Body dependent on the Soul Not from the earth, or skies, Or seasons as they roll, Come health and vigor to the frame; But from the living soul. Is this alive to God, And not the slave of sin? Then will the body, too, receive Health from the soul within. But, if disease has touched The spirit's inmost part; In vain we seek, from outward things, To heal the deadly smart. The mind, the heart unchanged, Which clouded e'en our home; Will make the outward world the same, Where'er our feet may roam. The fairest scenes on earth, The mildest, purest sky Will bring no vigor to the step, No lustre to the eye. For He, who formed our frame, Made man a perfect whole; And made the body's health depend Upon the living soul. Poem No. 364; c. 17 October 1863 The Crisis With the great thought, thy Country's cause, its life, Mix not the selfish end of party gain; The Patriot knows no party in the strife, When called his Country's freedom to maintain. Against the principles, which make us free, Against the rights of Man, our foes contend; And at the root of Liberty's fair tree The axe is laid, by such as these befriend. Choose ye this day, whose service ye prefer, For Freedom, or for Bondage, will ye fight? No more the duty of the hour defer, To follow Truth, to vindicate the Right; But give thyself to Freedom's holy cause, Thy Country's honor, and thy Country's laws. Poem No. 847; c. 23 October 1863 The Forsaken Harvest Field When the farmer, from his fields, Home has borne the ripened grain; Where his hands no more can reap, Harvests yet for me remain. Autumn flowers, of every hue, Brightly bloom along my way; Golden rods and asters fair Make the fields and pastures gay. Then the bitter-sweet I seek, Draping rock and leafy tree; And its berries homeward bear, Ripened harvest left for me. Then the gentian, trustful flower! In the meadow low I find; Last of Autumn's brilliant train, Fearless of the chilling wind! Scattered o'er his stubble ground, Each some lesson can impart; Wisdom for the thoughtful mind, Pleasure for the feeling heart. Oft your lessons, on my walks, Autumn flowers! I ponder o'er; But how little have I learned Of your sweet and sacred lore! Poem No. 794; c. 24 November 1863 The Freedmen of the Mississippi Valley Wakeful I think upon the suffering race, That, fled from bondage, claim our fostering care; What tongue their want can tell, or pen can trace, Or who the story of their woes could bear? The mother with her child, the aged one, Now unprotected from the wintry blast; Soon, soon for them the winter will be gone, Soon, without aid, their sufferings here be past! Help, till the storms of winter shall be o'er, When their own hands abundance will supply; Give all thou canst, food, raiment, from thy store, Nor aught thou hast these suffering ones deny; Lest they, escaped from Slavery's hateful chain, Should find but graves in Freedom's fair domain. Poem No. 757; c. 26 December 1863 Dying Words of John Foster âI Can Pray, And That's a Glorious Thing.â The dying Christian peaceful lay, No more his hands could do; No more his feet the earthly paths Of duty could pursue. No more the Gospel's joyful sound Could he to men proclaim; To warn them of the strength of sin, Make known a Savior's name! That all at length should hear his voice, The dead should hear &amp; live; That God was love, a Father still, And ready to forgive. His earnest mind, so strong and clear The realms of thought to scan, No more, with steadfast will, could toil To serve his fellow man. Where once was strength, was weakness now; Weakness unknown before; Yet with a spirit calm, resigned, The change he meekly bore. For in that Master's steps he trod, Whom he so long had loved; And faith in him sustained his soul, And all-sufficient proved. âStill I can pray,â he cheerful said, âAnd that's a glorious thing;â âO Grave, where is thy victory? O Death, where is thy sting?â Poem No. 489; 1863 Home and Heaven With the same letter heaven and home begin, And the words dwell together in the mind; For they who would a home in heaven win, Must first a heaven in home begin to find. Be happy here, yet with a humble soul, That looks for perfect happiness in heaven; For what thou hast is earnest of the whole, Which to the faithful shall at last be given. As once the patriarch, in vision blest, Saw the swift angels hastening to and fro; And the lone spot, whereon he lay to rest, Became to him the gate of heaven below; So may to thee, when life itself is done, Thy home on earth and heaven above be one. Poem No. 848; January 1864 The Search For The Truth Not Vain Is that Philosophy, which doth declare, That man the Truth may seek, but never find? Do all its teachings end but in despair? Knows it but this, that Wisdom's self is blind? Such might the ancient sages have confessed, On whom the Truth, undimmed, had never shone; Not he, whose mind its noon-day beams have blessed, And who, from earliest years, its words have known. Those words to Him who spake them ever lead, To Christ, to God, who doth the truth inspire; Not vain the search, if in his Word we read, And of the Sacred Oracles inquire; Where he, who seeks the Truth, will surely find The world's True Light, which lightens every mind. Poem No. 303; c. 20 February 1864 On The Three Hundredth Anniversary of Shakespeare's Birthday Shakespeare, whose life once filled an English home, With childhood's mirth and manhood's noble cheer, What time our fathers to these wilds did roam; We hail thee, mighty Bard! without a peer! To thee did Nature's countless forms unfold Their meaning, hidden from the common eye; The earth, the sea, the sky, their secrets told, And man's deep spirit did to thine reply. By Avon's banks we tread; thy home we see, The church, where still in peace thy bones repose; Join with the throng, that holds thy Jubilee, And guards thy fame, that, with each century, grows; No longer to thy native land confined, For the whole world may claim thy glorious mind. Poem No. 417; April 1864 Hymn The Way of the Righteous Easy Thou dost make the pathway easy For thy saints to travel in; Though it seem but steep and tiresome, When the journey they begin. Not the path of ease and pleasure Have they chosen here to go; But the way that upward leadeth, From the flowery vale below. Thou dost tax their powers of action, Powers of body and of mind; Till the world they have forsaken, Left each pleasing lure behind. Then the way Thou makest easy To their worn and weary feet; And doth cheer their spirit's fainting, Showing them thy glorious seat! Far below they see the cities Of the low and darksome plain; Where the sons of earth-born pleasure, In their bondage, still remain. Noble forms appear around them, Heavenly voices cheer them on; And thy holy mountain's summit, By their feet is quickly won. Poem No. 671; c. 7 May 1864 Untimely Arguments Thou arguest wisely, with profoundest skill, Forgetful that the world doth onward move; That, swifter than thy thought, the active will Doth all thy arguments but useless prove. He, who on shipboard has outsailed his foe, Cares not for lessons in the sailing art; The other may the science better know, But he has gained, e'en at the first, the start. 'Tis not the time for speech, or calm debate, When, like the waves, event event succeeds; Thy reasonings may be good, but come too late, To serve man's good, or check his evil deeds; Already doth the event the case decide, And faithful from the faithless too divide. Poem No. 658; c. 11 June 1864 Hymn Ps. XLVI. 10: âBe still, and know that I am God.â In the shock of mighty armies, Which the land with tumults fill; Learn, my soul, the lesson taught thee, And, in waiting trust, be still. Though the solid earth be shaken, And the mountains tottering fall; Yet, if God be our protection, Naught can harm, and naught appall. He, in every time of trouble, Is a present help indeed; And will to his children hearken, In their darkest hour of need. He our country will deliver, If we call upon his name; And the foes of Truth, and Justice, He will put to open shame. Come, behold what works he doeth! Making wars at length to cease; Sending to earth's farthest borders Messengers of love, and peace; Calling on the sinful nations To forsake their sins, and pride; And believe the Savior's message, Who, for all who live, has died. He in earth will be exalted, And his purposes fulfil; Know my soul his power, and goodness, And, in waiting trust, be still! Poem No. 300; c. June 1864 The Voice of Nature in Youth And Age With sights of beauty rare, In earth, and sea, and air, Nature invites her children aye to roam; âCome, liveâ, she says, âwith me, A life unchecked and free, And leave your home.â âCome, o'er the ocean rove, Through flower-decked field and grove; Come walk with me, nor longer idly pine; With you my gifts I'll share Of earth, and sea, and air; For all are mine.â Listening, youth leaves behind His home, his parents kind; And with a sense of freedom onward goes; Long seems the summer's day, And blooms along his way The blushing rose. And days and years pass by; All things, in earth and sky, To him are known. He nature's lord doth stand! Her powers obey his will, He flies, with magic skill, O'er sea and land. But o'er him comes a change! No more he loves to range; Nor power, nor knowledge will his soul suffice; He backward turns his gaze, And thoughts of other days Bedew his eyes. Although with freedom blest, His spirit longs for rest; Longs for the friendships of life's early morn; And memory brings to mind The home of parents kind, Where he was born. There age shall soothe his grief, And bring his soul relief From care, and toil, and pain, that downward bend; There Nature's voice doth seem, As in his early dream, Like human friend. Poem No. 843; c. 15 July 1864 Hymn Christ's Invitation in the Apocalypse You, who confess that you are poor, And blind, and sinful, come to me! For I have riches that endure, The sick I heal, the blind make see. Yes, you will come! For well you know, That you are poor and all things need; And I have treasures to bestow, That can the soul make rich indeed. And you, who say that rich you are, And needing nothing I can give; O stand not in your pride afar! But come to me, and you shall live. For you are naked, poor, and blind, And wretched, though you know it not; While you the gold of earth may find, The heavenly treasures are forgot. I counsel you to buy of me The gold that has been tried by fire, Anoint your eyes that you may see, And buy of me the saints' attire. You will not come! For still your sight Is blinded by the world's bright glare; In earthly things you take delight, And naught for things of mine you care. Poem No. 858; c. 23 July 1864 Hymn In Drought Not without thee, our God, the skies Pour down the plenteous rain; To thee our prayers in faith arise, Nor shall we ask in vain. Scorched are the hills on every side, And e'en the meadows dry, And dry the brooks, that through them glide, And verdure fresh supply. The birds are hushed, the cattle stand Beside the empty pool; Or wander far on every hand, Their raging thirst to cool. In vain to Science would we look, To teach, of this, the cause; She finds in nature's wondrous book, But fixed and general laws. Through Nature's laws, we look to Thee, On whom those laws depend; And, in the suffering that we see, Would own some gracious end. Teach us the lesson we should learn, To look to Thee in prayer; From sin and every idol turn, And daily own thy care. Poem No. 371; July 1864 The Rain The rain descends; each drop some drooping flower, Or parched blade drinks in with grateful haste; Nor is there, from the plenteous falling shower, A drop that nature will permit to waste. Upon the river falls the pattering rain In countless drops, that soon are seen no more; The river swells, and overflows the plain, And richer harvests wave than e'er before. Nor think, that on the surface of the rock The rain drop falls in vain, a useless thing; From out the crevice of the granite block The savin grows, and lichens to it cling; And there, when all around is parched and dry, The thirsty birds will come and find a full supply. Poem No. 549; c. 20 August 1864 The Fair Morning The clear bright morning, with its scented air, And gaily waving flowers, is here again; Man's heart is lifted with the voice of prayer, And peace descends, as falls the gentle rain; The tuneful birds, that all the night have slept, Take up, at dawn, the evening's dying lay; When sleep upon their eyelids gently crept, And stole, with stealthy craft, their song away. High overhead the forest's swaying boughs Sprinkle with drops the traveller on his way He hears afar the bells of tinkling cows, Driven to pasture at the break of day; With vigorous step he passes swift along, Making the woods reecho with his song. Poem No. 478a; c. 3 September 1864 The Clouded Morning The morning comes, and thickening clouds prevail, Hanging like curtains all the horizon round, Or overhead in heavy stillness sail, So still is day, it seems like night profound! Scarce by the city's din the air is stirred, And dull and deadened comes its every sound; The cock's shrill, piercing voice subdued is heard, By the thick folds of muffling vapors drowned. Dissolved in mists the hills and trees appear, Their outlines lost and blended with the sky; And well-known objects, that to all are near, No longer seem familiar to the eye; But with fantastic forms they mock the sight, As when we grope amid the gloom of night. Poem No. 529; c. 1 October 1864 Nature Repeats Her Lessons Nature repeats her lessons; day and night, With the same solemn words, to all return; To all the morning comes with cheering light, And over all the stars of evening burn. The seasons, to their coming ever true, Repeat the lesson of the varied year; The early flower, the fading leaf we view, But their oft-spoken words we fail to hear. For thoughts of pleasure, or of sordid gain, Possess the heart and cloud the seeing eyes; Nature in youth and manhood speaks in vain, For trifles light her wisdom we despise; And e'en in age at last, when wiser grown, But half her meaning to our minds is known. Poem No. 349; c. 5 November 1864 What Is A Word? What is a word? A spirit-birth, Born of the living soul; Which, uttered by the voice of man, Time's power cannot controul. A gift thou art to man alone, To bird and beast denied; To show that to the heavenly race His nature is allied. Mysterious Essence! Birth and death Are in one instant thine; Yet, born and dying with a breath, Thy being is divine. The outward world thou dost ally To things by man unseen; And, like an angel, ever pass The heavens and earth between. Thou dost to childhood's feeble powers A help to knowledge lend; And aid the race, from age to age, Its wisdom to transcend. Thou tellest of the distant Past, And bid'st it live again; And can, with mystic key, unlock The Future's dim domain. Still lingering in our common tongue We hear the elder speech; And words, which fell from Adam's lips, His latest offspring reach. The world and all it holds shall fade, And man himself shall die; But thou, unchanged, shalt live the same, Through God's eternity. Poem No. 774; c. November 1864 To Charles W. Felt Esq. On His New Type-Setting Machine While men, in War's dread service, tax their powers New weapons to invent to harm and slay; A new invention, Charles, thou hast made ours, And one prophetic of a brighter day; When man with man no longer shall contend, Save with the nobler weapons of the mind; When War on earth forevermore shall end, And Peace all nations shall forever bind; The Press with mightier power the truth diffuse, And like the sun each darkened land illume; And none the light of Knowledge shall refuse To those who sit in ignorance and gloom; But all shall Liberty &amp; Knowledge share, Who see the sun, or breathe the vital air! Poem No. 810; 12 December 1864 The Young Drummer Boy of Libby Prison An Incident Related by Capt. James Hussey. The slumberer wakes! âAre these the walls, The prison walls around, I see?â His voice unto his comrades calls, The sharers of his misery. âThou hast been dreaming,â one replied. He answered;ââWas it then a dream? I stood beside the river wide, My native Hudson's noble stream: My mother dear was with me there, And in her arms did me embrace; I gazed upon the prospect fair, And on her happy, smiling face. We talked of all our sufferings here, As if they all were passed and o'er; I wake to shed the bitter tear, For I shall see her face no more!â A few short hours, and death had broke The starving captive's galling chain; To life, immortal life he woke, That knows no tears, nor death, nor pain. O dream, which closed his earthly life! Be thou fulfilled in happier clime, Where hushed, forever hushed the strife, Which saddens oft the years of time. Still visit those, who sink and pine In prison's gloom, from friends afar; And o'er the dying prisoner shine, With radiance bright as evening's star! Poem No. 566; c. 30 December 1864 Inward Direction With outward impulse, running to and fro, How many men with restless minds we meet, (Who but an outward impulse only know) In the swift cars, or in the busy street! By man they're sent, and man's behests fulfil, They hear no other voice within their souls; Nor have they learned to obey a higher will, Which earthly hopes, and earthly fears controls: They know not whence they came, nor whither tend; In trifling, vain pursuits their lives are spent; Unmindful of life's highest, holiest end, For which its days and years to us were lent; To learn the Father's will, his words to hear, And find his Presence with us always near! Poem No. 840; c. 7 January 1865 The Cherry Birds God maketh the birds his care, When the ground lies buried with snow, They speed through the cold, wintry air, He teacheth them where to go. In flocks to the city they speed, The ash tree's red berries to find; And perched on its branches they feed, Till they leave scarce a cluster behind. They come to the cottage door, Where the woodbine's berries remain; And the white snow is sprinkled o'er, With the berries' crimson stain. Strange visitants to us they seem, As they seek for their daily food; Forsaking the hard-frozen stream, The meadow and leafless wood; To visit the homes of men, Their lessons of trust to bring; And then to their wild haunts again, Their joyful flight to wing. Poem No. 149; c. 17 February 1865 The Soul's Questioning Of The Universe, And Its Beginning The simple rustic's soul Will question, Whence is man? And whence has come this perfect whole, The world's majestic plan? The plant, the grass, the tree, The forms 'mid which we dwell; Whence are they? When began to be? He asks; but none can tell; And the deep musing sage Doth the same questions ask; And spends his manhood and his age To solve the mighty task. But, without light from heaven, In vain we seek to find The answer; that, by faith,is given To man's bewildered mind. Not timeless Nature's date, As men believed of old; But God did all things first create, As in his Word is told. The forms of earth and air, The stars, the sun's bright flame, Alike his majesty declare, And magnify his name. And man himself he made Godlike erect and free, Made in the image it is said Of his own deity! Not all things now to know Our Maker placed us here, But to walk humbly here below, Walk in his love and fear. And these shall pass away, Wax old and fade with age; Created things must know decay, Declares the sacred page. Poem No. 563; c. 11 March 1865 Hymn Sung at the Eulogy on Abraham Lincoln June 1st 1865. O God! who dost the nations lead, Though oft in ways to them unknown; To thee we look, in this our need, A supplicant people seek thy throne. For he, whom thou didst raise to guide, Has fallen, by the assassin's hand; In thee alone would we confide, To guide, to guard, to save our land. Through perils great, from year to year, Thou hast thus far our nation brought; And given the victory to cheer, And, by our Chief, deliverance wrought. With earnest prayer he sought thy will, In all the great events of life; And nobly did his work fulfil, Through four long years of bloody strife. O, lift us up in this sad hour, Let not our Country's foes prevail; Sustain us by thy mighty power, Let not to us thy promise fail. May Justice, Liberty, and Peace, For which his life he freely gave, Bless all our land; and never cease To shed their glory round his grave. Poem No. 374; c. 1 June 1865 Soul-Sickness How many of the body's health complain, When they some deeper malady conceal; Some unrest of the soul, some secret pain, Which thus its presence doth to them reveal. Vain would we seek, by the physician's aid, A name for this soul-sickness e'er to find; A remedy for health and strength decayed, Whose cause and cure are wholly of the mind. To higher nature is the soul allied, And restless seeks its being's Source to know; Finding nor health, nor strength in aught beside; How often vainly sought in things below! Whether in sunny clime, or sacred stream, Or plant of wondrous powers of which we dream. Poem No. 193; c. 3 June 1865 Song of the Early Spring The clouds across the azure sky Fly swift, with changing forms; To tell that Winter's reign is o'er, Its snow, and cold, and storms. A warmer wind now breathes around, And in the balmy air It seems as if new life there came, A life for all to share. And welcome signs, on every hand, Of Spring's return I see; The sparrow by the roadside sings, How sweet its note to me! The grass along the turnpike's edge Grows green with sun, and showers; And soon will May, fair May be here, To scatter wide her flowers. Shall I, with dull, and thoughtless mind, Behold returning Spring; And to the gracious God above No thanks, no offering bring? With birds, and every living thing, My grateful hymn I raise; To thank the Giver of all good, And celebrate his praise. Poem No. 479; c. 17 June 1865 Sensibility to the Beauty and Fragrance of Flowers How freely do the flowers their wealth bestow Of beauteous tints on every passer by! How freely, too, their fragrance round them throw! To none, who pass, their gifts do they deny. But though for all their beauty they dispense, Alike for all their fragrance round them fling, Yet is there wanting oft a finer sense, Than to their blooming bowers we thoughtless bring. So, when I meet them in the vale, or wood, Or, on the hill, their varied charms survey; Blest with some purer thought, some happier mood, They to my soul a new delight convey; And, to their well-known haunts, as I draw near, More fair they seem, more fragrant they appear. Poem No. 186; c. 28 July 1865 What Is The Word? What is the word? I often hear men say, Greeting each other in the mart or street; Seeking for something new, from day to day, Of friend, or neighbor, whom they chance to meet. The question wakes in me the thoughtful mind, Do they receive the word they ask to hear? Or is it only like the passing wind, Or empty echo dying on the ear? The word, O man, is not some idle sound, Lost on the ear almost as soon as heard; Unto the wise life-giving it is found. And by its voice the inmost soul is stirred; It falls not on the mind a barren seed, But springeth up in fruitful thought, or deed. Poem No. 776; c. 12 August 1865 The Sight of the Ocean I gazed afar from the rocky hill, As if I never could drink my fill Of the prospect fair, the ocean wide, The blue, bright ocean on every side. For, with the prospect, grew my mind; And seemed, in the vast expanse, to find A space for its flight, without shore, or bound, Save the sky above, and the sea around. But soon o'er my spirit a feeling stole, A sad, lonely feeling I could not control; Which the sight of the ocean doth ever bring, As if, like the soul, 'twere a lonely thing. The plaintive wave, as it broke on the shore, Seemed sighing for rest forevermore; And glad at length the land to reach, And tell its tale to the silent beach. So seemed it then to my wandering thought, That in the vast prospect a home had sought; The shop o'er the waters a port may find, But never the longing and restless mind. As night o'er the ocean its shadow threw, And homeward the weary sea-bird flew; I turned from the dark and rocky height, With grateful heart, to my hearth-stone bright. Poem No. 230; c. 8 September 1865 Prayer For Rain Pray, pray for rain; thou may'st not know, How man's weak prayer avails; But pray, with earnest, trusting soul, The prayer of faith prevails. Pray, pray for rain; each morning lift Thy prayer with humble mind, That thou the longed-for gift may'st have, The promised blessing find. And pray, with earnest, humble prayer, For every perfect gift; To God in every time of need, Thy trusting spirit lift. He knows our needs before we ask, Yet bids us toil and pray, And ask of Him our daily bread To give us day by day. And when the blessing He shall send, Of rain, or daily food; O, let thy heartfelt prayer ascend, In loving gratitude! Poem No. 401; c. 15 September 1865 Hymn On The Logos The Light Still Shining In The Darkness Once I musing was in spirit, Why the Light in darkness shone; Why, amidst the early ages, It by man was never known. Though Essential, Uncreated, Though within the mind it beamed; Yet the Light none comprehended, Prophets mused and sages dreamed. Then to me a voice there answered, âWhy thy wonder thus express? In the world that Light still shineth, All mankind to save and bless. But how few behold its glory, Shining in the Savior's face! And how few his life have copied, Full of heavenly truth and grace. And though everywhere it shineth, Brighter than the orb of day; Men and nations still reject it, Walking not in wisdom's way. But to all who love, receive it, They the sons of God become; Dwelling with the Lord forever, In his bright, eternal home.â Poem No. 390; c. 23 September 1865 Hath The Rain A Father? Or Who Hath Begotten The Drops of Dew? Job 38:28 We say, âIt rains.â Slow of belief the Age; Its very words its unbelief doth show; Forgot the lessons of the sacred page, Spoken by men of faith so long ago! No farther than they see, men's faith extends; The mighty changes of the earth and sky To them are causeless all, where Science ends; An Unseen Cause they know not, or deny. They hear not in the whirlwind, or the storm, The mighty Voice, which spake to man of old; They see not in the clouds of heaven his form, Nor in his ceaseless works his power behold; Who maketh small the countless drops of rain, And sends soft showers upon the springing grain. Poem No. 764; October 1865 âIt is vain to say, that this is the country of the âwhite man.â It is the country of man.â Charles Sumner. True, noble words, which thrill the very soul,â This country is for man, the human race; Words, too, that should our policy control, If we would not our fatherland disgrace. This country is for all, of every name, Reserved by Providence' all-gracious plan, That each his proper dignity might claim,â The right to be, and feel himself a man. Here may the oppressed of foreign nations come, And find, in our wide country, peace and rest; The roving Indian reach a settled home, In the broad prairies of the fertile West; And here the slave, to manhood born at last, Forget the wrongs and miseries of the past. Poem No. 744; c. November 1865 The East India Marine Museum A noble company, that early band, Who left their homes to sail across the sea; And distant voyages to the Orient planned, The land of wealth, and dark Idolatry. Behold their Monument! the rich and rare, Gathered, with cost and pains, from every clime; And, in this spacious hall, preserved with care, To interest and instruct the future time; To cherish in their sons the spirit brave, Which gave to Salem its world-wide renown; That thus their exploits, on the ocean wave, From age to age might still be handed down; And distant generations might behold, And guard the trust, more precious far than gold. Poem No. 14; c. 15 December 1865 Finishing The Work âLet us strive to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to do all which may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace among ourselves, and with all nations.â Second Inaugural Address of PRESIDENT LINCOLN While men with ceaseless strife, in Church and State, About the means of doing good contend; The wounded man is left unto his fate, And, in the means, forgotten is the end. Lo, for the thousand years, the Church has striven To guide the nations in their heavenward way; But, by conflicting sects and dogmas riven, Too oft, alas! her light has led astray. And lo the State, still struggling to be free, Oft wastes the precious years in wordy strife; Forgetting the great end of Liberty, And the great work of every nation's life; To raise the low, instruct the darkened mind, And live in lasting peace with all mankind. Poem No. 811; c. December 1865 âO Lord, How Long?â One saint to another I heard say, âHow long?â I listened, but naught more I heard of the song; The shadows are gliding through city and plain; How long shall the night with its shadows remain? How long ere shall shine, in this glimmer of things, The light of which prophet in prophecy sings; And the gates of that city be open, whose sun No more to the west in its circuit shall run? Poem No. 392; c. 1865 Our Soldiers' Graves Strew all their graves with flowers, They for their country died; And freely gave their lives for ours, Their country's hope and pride. Bring flowers to deck each sod, Where rests their sacred dust; Though gone from earth, they live to God, Their everlasting trust! Fearless in Freedom's cause They suffered, toiled, and bled; And died obedient to her laws, By truth, and conscience led. Oft as the year returns, She o'er their graves shall weep; And wreath with flowers their funeral urns, Their memory dear to keep. Bring flowers of early Spring To deck each soldier's grave, And Summer's fragrant roses bring; They died our land to save. Poem No. 447; 1861â65? The Still Small Voice The Lord passed by! A mighty wind The lofty mountains rent The ancient trees, by the strong blast, Like pliant reeds were bent. But in the wind the Lord was not; Nor in the earthquake dire, Which shook the solid mountain's base, Nor in the flaming fire. But, after these, a still, small voice The listening prophet heard; And in his mantle wrapt his face, He knew it was the Lord. The War is past, with earthquake shock That shook our native land; And quenched the fierce, consuming flame, By his divine command. And now the still small voice we hear, Unheard amidst its strife; That bids the sons of men return Unto the paths of life. O, may we know that pardoning voice, That speaketh from above! And to its words of Peace and Love Forever faithful prove. Poem No. 523; 1865? Indian Relics In making the excavations for the moat, at Fort Pickering, on Winter Island, the grave of an Indian was found; in which were many curious relics. These are now in the possession of the Essex Institute. A touching sight, these relics rude, Again exposed to day! Where once, in nature's solitude, They first were laid away. An Indian's bones, and dust are here, His arms for war and chase; The arrow-heads, and pointed spear, The weapons of his race. And various implements of stone, Which for his use he made; The well-wrought bowl, and tools unknown Are with his weapons laid. Was it, that, in another life, Again these things he'd need? Again renew his savage strife, Or through the forest speed? 'Twas thus he pictured life again, No higher vision knew; And from the natural, earthly plane, His highest wisdom drew. And who are they who stand around, And view his narrow bed? What nobler knowledge have they found, Who in God's Book have read? Have they learned there, what Nature wise Doth in dim figure teach; That man in nobler form shall rise, And his perfection reach? Have they learned there the life of love, To live in lasting peace? For such alone can soar above, When earthly life shall cease! Then why this lofty fort uprear, Or dig this fosse deep, To leave war's sad memorials here, Their memory long to keep? To prove that, in the Gospel's light, Dark hate the soul can fill; And nations with each other fight, And boast their warlike skill. Poem No. 22; c. 12 January 1866 The Veil upon the Heart Why cannot I make plain, to sinful men, The heavenly kingdom that within me lies? That kingdom lies not far beyond their ken, Although its glory's hidden from their eyes. A veil there is! a veil, like that of old, Which hid the Christ from Jewish, Gentile mind; That they could not his wondrous life behold, But to his wisdom and his grace were blind! That veil is on the heart; unfelt, unseen By worldly men, who will not truth receive; In vain heaven's light would penetrate the screen, That they might on the truth of God believe; His glorious kingdom to their souls is near, They see it not! nor can its welcome hear! Poem No. 817; c. 27 January 1866 True Knowledge Necessary for the Voyage of Life Ships on the ocean meet, each other hail, âWhere from?â they say? and, âWhither art thou bound?â Response is given; then on their voyage they sail, Cheered by the cry, though dangers still surround. Whither, O man! and whence, o'er life's dark sea, Dost thou thy frail and tossing vessel steer? Knowest thou that ocean's depth and mystery? And canst thou to those questions answer clear, Then mayst thou cheerful on Life's voyage proceed, Nor dread its storms, nor fear its currents strong; The soul, from darkling doubt and error freed, By favoring gales is swiftly borne along; While driven by adverse winds, by tempests tost, The skeptic's bark, on unknown shores, is lost! Poem No. 420; c. 26 May 1866 Sonnet There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.â I Cor. xv. 44. I gazed upon the silent burial-ground, Where many forms lay mingling with the dust; The gloomy shades of night had veiled it round, And nought I saw to inspire a Christian's trust. âWhere are the forms,â I said, âthat once I knew,â Of friends and kindred, whom I love so well? Have they for ever vanished from my view? Ah! who will come their blessed abode to tell?â But, as I spake, I turned my tear-dimmed eyes Upwards, where countless stars and planets roll, Filling with splendors bright the wintry skies; And, like a revelation to my soul, Came, from their shining orbs, a voice that said, âSo come, in glorious forms, with Christ, the dead!â Poem No. 231; c. June 1866 Nature's Help for the Soul When, wrapt in self, the soul grows dull, And thought doth lose its power, Open thy window, gaze abroad, Go forth and walk an hour. Commune with things, which God has made, The earth, the sea, the sky; Let every object grand and fair Allure thy languid eye. These shall from self the spirit free, Restore its healthy tone; And banish doubt and care, that cloud The mind too much alone. For this the earth, the sea, the sky, In beauty were arrayed; In flower, and shell, and star, and sun, God's glory is displayed. For flower and sun alike are parts Of one majestic plan, The smallest object he beholds A study is for man. That, drawn by each, the soul may leave Its doubts and cares behind; And, in fair Nature's boundless realm, New health and vigor find. Poem No. 797; c. 14 July 1866 Nature a Living Teacher I would not study Nature's lore In books, or cabinets displayed; But hill, and wood, and beach explore, Where lessons ne'er from memory fade. In the dry leaf, and scentless flower I scarce the rose, or violet know; But in the field, or leafy bower, How sweet they smell! how bright they glow! The pearly shell no longer shines, From the sea-shore borne far away; The crystals of the deep, dark mine No more their sparkling light display. The butterflies on rainbow wings I watch as here and there they rove, Or listen as some songster sings, And fills with music all the grove. Their stiff, dead forms with pain I see, The beauteous bird's unruffled breast; The butterflies, once roving free, With wings forevermore at rest! No longer now they lessons teach, Such as from Nature's self I learn; So to the fields, and pebbly beach From Science' joyless halls I turn. Poem No. 290; c. 10 August 1866 Primitive Worship God's worship to no temple is confined, Amid the scenes of Nature it may be; The song of praise borne on the summer wind, Beneath the shelter of the forest tree. So mused I, as I walked beside the lake, Where Peters preached unto the listening throng; The low-voiced waves that on its borders break, With whispering pines all joined the sacred song. So mused I, as amid the Camp I strayed, Where Christians yearly meet for praise and prayer; Beneath the hemlock's shade the people prayed, And sweet their voices rose upon the air; As when our fathers mid these forests trod, And, without temples, worshipped here their God. Poem No. 151; 24 August 1866 The Holy Land I go not on a pilgrimage, As those, who went of old; The holy land around us lies, Of which we have been told. 'Tis everywhere. The pure in heart Alone can enter in, And those, whom grace and love have made Forever free from sin. I see it, when the morning sun Doth rise o'er land and sea; The moon's mild beams, the silent stars, Reveal it unto me. In all that's good, in all that's fair, I see its glory shine; As in the holy land of old, The ancient Palestine. Wherever Freedom, Truth prevail, Wherever God is known; That land is still Jehovah's land He calls it still his own. And brighter yet, in days to come, Shall shine its wondrous light; Till all the earth is holy land, With heavenly radiance bright. I go not on a pilgrimage, As those, who went of old; The holy land around us lies, Of which we have been told. Poem No. 233; c. 1 September 1866 Standley's Grove How quick upon the eye and mind, Flashes the prospect on the sight; Like a surprise, which Nature planned, For those who climb this lofty height. With patient steps we upward wind, Till on its rocky brow we stand; Where, at one glance, we see outspread A picture fair of sea and land! The harbor with its islands green, The rocks o'er which the breakers foam, And, inland far, the city's spires, The factory's towers, and many a home; From which a merry band has come Of sportive children, bright and fair, To swing and dance and rove and sing, And breathe a while a purer air. Their elders, too, their sports enjoy, For once they all were children too; Mid scenes like this their years forget, And with the young their youth renew. The music and the social feast Add to the pleasures of the hour, And swift the winged moments fly, Beneath the pine grove's sheltering bower. For see aglow the western sky, With the last rays of parting day; We bid farewell to hill and grove, And to our homes we speed away. Poem No. 198; c. 28 September 1866 October All day, amidst the forests' splendor bright, Spread o'er the landscape far as eye could see, We journeyed on; and every vale and height Transfigured in the glory seemed to be. What colors of the earth, or e'en the sky, Can paint the hues, which decked each hill and plain; That, with their richness, tired the gazing eye? What canvass can those wondrous tints retain? Yet, as the seasons of the year return, Again o'er all the land will they be cast; Again each height and plain with glory burn, And shall as long as Nature's self shall last; Crowning with beauty e'en her latest day, When all that we behold shall pass away! Poem No. 30; October 1866 The Soldier and the Statesman The soldier to preserve his Country dies, When'er in peril hangs its very life; With ardent courage to the field he flies, And mingles fearless in the fatal strife. That Country safe; the ends, for which it lives, Become the patriot statesman's highest goal; To these his life and all he has he gives, He lives not for a party, but the whole: That all the rights of men may there enjoy, That liberty of speech and thought may spread, And every foe to freedom thus destroy; Towards those great ends, with steadfast mind he's led, For which the nation sprang at first to birth, And gained a name and glory through the earth. Poem No. 567; c. 27 November 1866 The Triumphs of Science, And of Faith Beneath the ocean's ever-tossing breast, Now ruffled only by the summer wind, Sinks the vast cable to its final rest, Which shall two continents together bind. Triumph of Science over space and time, That kindred nations long have kept apart! When shall our Faith, with triumphs as sublime, Bind realm to realm and kindred heart to heart? Yet still, in faith, man's triumph we behold, Subduing nature to his lofty will; And wait the day, in prophecy foretold, Which, tarrying long, Oh may our age fulfil! When nations shall from strife forever cease, And the whole earth shall dwell in sacred peace. Poem No. 66; November 1866 Christian Influence And wouldst thou hasten, in another soul, God's Kingdom on the earth of love and peace; Learn first thyself, thy spirit to control, From all that's false and evil in thee cease. Nor think, that suddenly the reign shall come, With pomp and glory for the outward eye; Within, around thee, in thine earthly home, The Kingdom of the Lord is drawing nigh! As shines the light, with still increasing ray, Till from the earth the brooding night has fled; So, in man's spirit, comes the eternal day; As gently as the dawn its beams have spread; Till all within, and all around is bright, And the whole world rejoices in its light. Poem No. 50; c. 2 February 1867 The Reconciling Power O Power! that waits not on man's feeble will, Though granted still to faith, and hope, and prayer; Thy gracious purposes in us fulfil, And may we in thy favor ever share. Vain is the people's strength, the ruler's power; The statesman's wisdom and his arts are vain; They hasten not on earth the blessed hour, Which thou, in thine own keeping, doth retain. The world, with its vain shows, doth souls divide, Renew in all the simple heart of youth; That friend from friend, by passion sundered wide, May live again the life of love and truth. Still mightier energies thou hast in store, Than those with which the world has yet been blest; Enduring peace, ne'er known on earth before, The nations' Sabbath, the Millennial Rest. O'er our wide land thy quickening influence send, That, as one people, we may soon rejoice; That party strife and pride may have an end, Subdued and healed by thine all-powerful voice! Poem No. 378; February 1867 The Heralds of the Spring My ear is listening for the sound Of earliest bird upon the tree, Or sparrow, flitting o'er the ground, Whose note so welcome is to me. How long the trees have silent stood, Through the cold, cheerless, winter days! How lone the fields, the turnpike's road, While hushed so long the sparrow's lays! They tell of Spring's returning reign, With its warm sun and milder sky: That every stream has burst its chain, And the green grass and flowers are nigh. When man with Nature too awakes, And feels with it the quickening breath; And of the general joy partakes Of earth's return from sleep and death, Come quickly then, with welcome song, Ye heralds of the early Spring; Why tarry on your way so long, Nor haste your joyful notes to sing? Poem No. 335; c. 4 April 1867 The Bridge of Time High o'er a flood, which boils and foams below, Upon a bridge, with musing steps, I tread; Who built its ancient piers we cannot know, Long since their names were numbered with the dead. Scarcely a thought the hurrying travellers give To those old builders, long since passed away; Contented in the present time to live, To enjoy the pleasures of the passing day. Yet on their memory I grateful dwell, As on I walk amid the thoughtless throng; And of their toils for others fain would tell, And celebrate their virtues in my song. For who can say, how many nameless ones, With busy hands, have toiled from year to year; To gather, one by one, these moss-grown stones, To raise the arch and build the massive pier. Who fashioned first the spade, the axe, the knife, The tools man needs where'er his feet may roam? Who taught mankind the arts that cherish life, And fill with comforts many a happy home? Who laid the State's foundations firm and deep, That winds and waves might not its strength o'erthrow; That the full river might its channel keep, And man's strong passions still their bounds might know? Forgotten mid the conquerors of old, Whose deeds have filled the annals of our race; Their names proud History has never told, Nor midst its heroes found for them a place. For peaceful ends they lived, and toiled, and died, For ends unto themselves perhaps unknown; But to the future is the past allied, Nor without purpose raised the smallest stone. If high and safe o'er Time's deep, swelling flood, They have prepared a pathway for mankind; Which has its current and its rage withstood, How great the work which they have left behind! And shall not we, as o'er Time's bridge we move, The builders' skill, and strength, and toil admire; And, moved alike by gratitude and love, To nobler deeds and nobler lives aspire? Poem No. 173; c. 6 April 1867 Our Dear Mother No more our mother meets our sight, As here she moved from day to day, Our constant solace and delight;â She from our home is called away! Her books, her work are laid aside, No more the household is her care; And to our hearts the joy's denied, At times her daily toils to share. Her plants, her study and her joy, With their bright verdure and their bloom, No more her leisure hours employ, Nor give to her their sweet perfume. Long did she labor for our good, To inform the mind, improve the heart; Cared for our raiment, health, and food, With all a mother's love and art. Far into night her busy hand, Or thoughtful care our comfort sought; With morning's light again she planned, And with untiring patience wrought. To her we came in every ill, Whether of body, or of mind; Sure in her sympathy and skill, Healing and balm for each to find. And still, though now we see her not, I know her thoughts must on us dwell; That we can never be forgot, Whom here she loved, and loved so well. Clothed in immortal form of light, E'en now, perchance, she hovers round; Though unperceived by mortal sight, Nor known by words of mortal sound; A messenger, by night, by day, Sent by our heavenly Father's love; Unseen, to guide us on our way Unto her blessed home above! Poem No. 356; May 1867 Hymn The Word Before All Things Not first the things, which we behold; Though they, since time began, E'en from Creation's dawn of old, Have been beheld by man. Not first the grove, the hill, the stream, Though beauteous to the sight; Nor first the sun's bright, golden beam, Nor stars with silvery light. Nor first were beasts, nor creeping things, Nor insects' glittering throng, Nor birds, that soar on sun-bright wings, And fill the groves with song: But first the Word, which gave them birth, Eternal and divine; Which built the heavens, and spread the earth, And bade the stars to shine. By it, each thing that is was made, Beast, insect, bird, and man; Ere earth's foundations first were laid, God saw the wondrous plan. In it is light forever pure, Brighter than man can see; That must eternally endure, When these shall cease to be. Within the darkened human mind It shines, though dimmed its ray; To lead the soul, which sin makes blind, To realms of endless day; Where fairer things, and more sublime, That Word shall then reveal; Which, now, the world of sense and time Doth from man's sight conceal. Poem No. 363; c. June 1867 The Whiteweed Swept by every passing breeze, See the meadow fall and rise! See its green waves, sprinkled o'er With the whiteweed's starry eyes! Gay they bend as in a dance, Up and down a thousand ways; So I've watched them many an hour, In my bygone childhood's days. Still I watch them, as of old, With an ever new delight; Following still their mazy dance, Ever changing to the sight. For of grace and beauty still Do they now as ever teach; Vain are fancy's feeble powers Nature's perfect forms to reach. Poem No. 451; June 1867 The Teachings of the Spirit Not of the earth, nor sense are we, Though here on earth we dwell; But higher things than these we see, Of higher things can tell. The Spirit doth our spirits teach, Though dull, and slow to hear; And messages it brings to each, Had each the listening ear. It speaks of God, it speaks of heaven, Of Christ, who from it came; And of eternal life, that's given To those who love his name. Of faith and hope, and peace and joy, Unknown to worldly mind; Which time, and sense cannot destroy, Which they who seek shall find. Come, Holy Spirit, from above, And of thy gifts impart; Come with thy light, thy truth, thy love, And dwell in every heart. Poem No. 367; c. 3 July 1867 Hymn Amidst the pastures green, Beside the rivers still; Thou leadest those, O Lord, in peace, Who seek to do thy will. They rest 'neath shady rock, Or trees beside the way; Nor more they thirst, no more they feel The sun's hot, scorching ray. No more the world disturbs, Or fills them with alarm; For where thou givest peace, and rest, Vain is man's power to harm. And near those pastures green, Those peaceful rivers near; To all who seek to do thy will, Thy voice of love to hear. Thou teachest them the way, Unseen by other eyes; And, e'en amidst the desert waste, Prepar'st a glad surprise. Poem No. 43; JulyâOctober 1867 The Help of the Spirit How can we upward go, Without thy help, O Lord? The way of life indeed we know, For thou hast taught us in thy blessed word. Still upward doth it lead, But we grow faint, and weak; A strength above our own we need, That strength from thee we seek. For thou art present still, Though not sense and sight; Thy word of promise to fulfil Of strength, and peace, and light. Thou hast not left alone Thy followers here below; To thee their trials all are known, And help thou dost bestow. The Spirit thou dost send, To cheer the mind, and heart; To guide them to their journey's end, And nevermore depart! Poem No. 181; c. 3 August 1867 The Birthright Church The birthright church; where shall we find its door, For every new-born soul to enter in; And, once within, never to leave it more, To wander in the paths of doubt, and sin? In churches of the past with crumbling walls, To which the moss, and climbing ivy cling? No; from the coming future still it calls, And to the present doth its promise bring. City of God, descending out of heaven, Beheld by seer of old in vision bright! O may it to our eyes, like his, be given To see on earth thy mild, and peaceful light; Shining, with steadfast beams, on childhood's way, That it from out thy gates no more may stray. Poem No. 466; c. 26 October 1867 Midas Turn all I touch to gold, King Midas said. His wish was granted, and behold! His very meat was gold, gold his bread. And liquid gold the drink He raised on high; When o'er the golden goblet's brink, The water to his eager lips came nigh. Ah fatal gift! that balked His greedy soul; Which in its very richness mocked; For gold is but one thing, and not the whole. So they, who money seek, Gold, only gold; Are childish, disappointed, weak, Though gained their end; like that famed king of old. Poem No. 745; c. 29 October 1867 Revelation Addressing reason, yet above it still, The True Religion speaks unto the soul; It bids the conflicts of the mind be still, And doth each motive of the will controul. From low to higher still is nature's law, Written on stony tablets of the earth; And things we see upward the spirit draw To things, and beings of a nobler birth. Nor man alone aspires; but God descends, And to our faculties doth lend his aid; That we, amidst our doubts, may see the ends, For which the world, and all therein were made; See too his gracious love for sinful man, More wondrous far than e'en Creation's plan. Poem No. 26; c. 7 December 1867 How come the Dead? How come the dead? we anxious ask, When, parting from our sight, The spirit leaves its earthly home, To dwell in realms of light. How come the dead? Shall we no more The friends we love behold; Nor clasp again within our arms, Their forms so still, and cold? The very question that we ask, May its own answer give; Is it the mortal that we mourn? Our friends immortal live. They come, though unperceived by sense, Through memory's open door; We see their looks, their voices hear, Familiar as before. They come; for hope will whisper still, Undying in the heart; That friends who love shall meet again, Meet nevermore to part. And faith, with heaven-directed gaze, As seeing things concealed; Declares the dead, with Christ, shall come, When he shall be revealed! Poem No. 183; c. January 1868 The Hacker School House Swift fly the years! Men call thee mean and old, But I behold thee still as in thy prime; The scroll of memory quickly is unrolled, Wherein I read of childhood's early time; Of that first morn, when finished, bright, and new, We took our seats within thy well-built walls; The master's voice I hear, his form I view, As to his place, in order, each he calls. Again I see, 'twas a beauteous sight! Adorned with evergreen, and summer flowers; The parents sharing in their sons' delight, And gay the school room looked as garden bowers. Thus ever stand, flower-wreathed and fair and new, A picture bright for memory to view! Poem No. 452; c. 27 March 1868 The Houstonia Welcome sweet flower, that scent'st the morn, From the moist earth so newly born, Sprinkling afar the grassy sod, Where'er I look for many a rod! In families thou lov'st to grow, Sweet, social bands, a beauteous show; As if some secret tie did bind Each floweret, like the human kind. Companion of the little child, With eye so blue, and look so mild, To me as welcome is thy bloom, As welcome too thy sweet perfume. He calls thee, Innocent, a name Unknown to science, or to fame; A name that he from Nature took, Expressive of thy form and look. Thou dost return, with early spring, Thy fragrance and thy bloom to bring; To call the young with willing feet, To seek thee in thy wild retreat. With them do I, in early May, Rejoice to greet thee on my way; And e'en when summer's heats have come, To find thee still where'er I roam. In thy slight form, and mild blue eye, To feel some bond of sympathy; And learn again the lesson mild, Thou taught'st me, when a little child. Poem No. 768; c. 12 May 1868 To The Salem Gazette, On The Completion Of Its First Century One hundred years with their events have fled, Since first thy sheet was sent from door to door; How many have thy pleasant pages read, Now known amid life's busy scenes no more! How vast the changes, since those years have flown; Our Country's growth in commerce, wealth, and power; The rule of haughty King long since o'erthrown, And Freedom's triumph in the present hour! And chronicled upon thy welcome page The news from country round, and o'er the sea; Domestic scenes endeared to youth and age, Instructive tale, or gem of poesy. For many a century may thy page record Each noble deed, and fitly-spoken word. Poem No. 391; c. early August 1868 Ocean's Treasures I walked on the ocean beach, I saw a beautiful shell; But 'twas carried beyond my reach, As the billows rose and fell. A sun-fish I sought to take, But the waves rolled strong and high, And bade me the prize forsake, And back from the breakers fly. Then a pebble, round and white, I sought of the ocean to steal; But the wave returned, and, far from sight, Did the stone in its bosom conceal. 'Twas as if it loved its own, The ocean so vast and drear; The shell and fish and round white stone To its mighty heart were dear. And a stranger sought to bear Its treasures far, far away; Where no more they'd shine forever fair, And bright with the dashing spray. Poem No. 281; c. 21 August 1868</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONNETS ON RECONSTRUCTION I. A Nation's Life Of Slow Growth Slowly a Nation doth unfold its life, A life, perhaps, in violence began; Unfolding still through years of peace, or strife, According to some high and noble plan. It seeks Perfection in the social state; Though oft astray by kings and conquerors led, Or party leaders, skilful in debate; To party, more than to their Country wed. Yet still the People, as by instinct taught, Or higher impulse moving every soul; By various fortunes on their way are brought, Till they shall reach at length the appointed goal; When all in social harmony shall dwell, And state 'gainst state no more again rebel. Poem No. 425; c. 18 September 1868 II. The Ends For Which A Nation Exists Was it for mere existence, that we fought, Contending only that the state might be? Through war's dread scenes the higher ends we sought Of Social Progress, civil Liberty; For which, at first, our fathers did contend; That here a true foundation might be laid, That far and wide the mighty tree might send Its roots into our soil, and spread its shade; For Education, free alike for all, For Temperance, Justice, Virtue, Order, Peace; That ancient wrongs and errors here might fall, And war on earth at length forever cease. What is a nation, if for party ends, Or for a mere existence it contends? Poem No. 759; c. 18 September 1868 III. Political Ambition Again doth lust of Power lift up its head, Seeking our Country for its ends to rule; Feeding the flame, which it so long has fed, Before war's lava torrents yet are cool. What are the ends for which it power would seek? To educate, to civilize, refine, To raise the lowly and uphold the weak, Develop, cherish every art benign? To make our land, by Providence so blest, Still onward in the path of progress move; That here the heavy laden might find rest, And nations dwell in brotherhood and love? Ah no;âit strives not thus mankind to bless, But only power to gain, and to possess. Poem No. 28; c. 25 September 1868 IV. National Unity A unity complete, assured, and high, Is that for which our Country still contends; Fulfilling thus a nation's destiny; For this its mighty energies it lends. No more for party purposes it lives, For it has entered on a nobler strife; A higher motive higher objects gives, Long years of progress, and of peaceful life; In which it may its vast domain explore, And with its commerce whiten every sea; Stretch the strong iron bands from shore to shore, Encourage Science, Art, and Industry; That thus established firm on Nature's plan, Might rise secure at length the work of man! Poem No. 23; c. 29 September 1868 Reflections on the History of Nations When I consider mighty nations' fate, Their rise, their growth, their grandeur, and decline; And all their varied history contemplate, I see and own in each the Hand divine! Not of themselves they rose to wealth and power, And gained on earth a glory and a name; Alike, to God, the nation of an hour, And that which stands a thousand years the same. To such as walk in righteousness and truth, He gives long years of steady, sure increase; They, like the eagle, shall renew their youth, Their honor and their glory never cease; While such as from his just commandments stray, Shall sudden fall; or waste by slow decay. Poem No. 788; 2 October 1868 Scepticism With Regard To The Gospels Strange words are these, that little now we know Of Him, who lived in ancient Palestine; And mighty works performed so long ago, Which all the ages since have called divine. That all is legend, mystery, which we read Of Him, who died mankind from death to save; He, who man from death, and error freed, Himself became the trophy of the grave. Ah faithless age! which cannot see the light, E'en though it does with noon-day brightness beam; Which boasts its Science and its clearer sight, Yet calls the Gospel histories but a dream. It is not that the Light has never shined, Nor shineth still; but we to it are blind! Poem No. 446; c. 31 October 1868 The Tide With daily ebb and flow The waters by us glide, They tell us of the mighty Power, That rules their constant tide. Yet, thoughtless still we gaze, Untaught from day to day; Unheeded still the unseen Hand, That doth their motions sway. As if thus, of itself, The river's tide might flow; Now fill its empty channels high, Then back to ocean go. As if attraction's force Could be the only law; And moon and sun could, of themselves, The bulk of ocean draw. Ah, who shall give us sight This miracle to see? In ocean's constant ebb and flow, The work of Deity! In Nature's constant law, To own God's ceaseless power; Who makes the sea to know its bounds, And keep the appointed hour. Poem No. 835; c. October 1868 The Spiritual Birth Thy knowledge cannot reach Unto the heavenly birth; Thou knowest only what is done Below, upon the earth. Believe, and thou shalt know Things holy and divine; Things unperceived by mortal sense, By faith alone are thine. To naught the Lord compares The Spirit, but the wind; Whose voice indeed we listening hear, But none its way can find. It calls thee to repent, Christ's kingdom enter in; And while thou dwellest here below, The heavenly life begin. Obey the Spirit's call, And by its voice be led; And thou within the heavenly courts, At length shall surely tread. Poem No. 713; c. November 1868 The Youth and the Stream The Youth. Why so swift thou hurrying tide, Why unto the ocean glide? Why not here prolong your stay, Through the long, bright summer's day? Here are flowers of every hue, Here are groves and fields to view; Stay, and let them ever rest Imaged on thy peaceful breast. The Stream. Why O mortal! thus replied, To my quest, the rushing tide. Why art thou, too, hurrying on, And so soon from earth art gone? All things here one law obey, Naught in time can rest, or stay; Use these moments as they fly, Time well-spent can never die; It but goes to fill the sea Of a blessed eternity. Mortal! raise your thoughts sublime, Find eternity in time! In the Christian's life is rest, He alone in time is blest; Living, in the passing hour, With a life beyond its power. Souls, made pure, do still retain Earth's fair flowers on hill, and plain; In their depths reflected are Groves, and fields, and evening star; Lit by Memory's golden ray There they never fade away. Poem No. 827; 1859â68? The Daily News As one who, standing safe upon the land, Beholds a vessel tossing on the wave, Or by the tempest driven on the strand, Without the power the mariner to save; So do I read, from danger's path afar, Of many a sad event on field, and flood; Of the fierce ravages of cruel war, Of people perishing from want of food; Of single sufferers, whom no help of mine Can ever reach, whom I can never see;â Why read the harrowing page, the mournful line, If I can only give my sympathy? Ah, say not so. Believe the Sacred Word, Pray for all men, the prayer of faith is heard! Poem No. 56; c. 9 January 1869 On A Hyacinth From Georgia Fair flower! that, from the southern skies, Hast reached us with thy bloom; Thou dost our hearts with joy surprise, And banish winter's gloom! For oft, we know not, how or why, Its gloom steals o'er the heart; Earth's frozen breast, the stormy sky, Seem of ourselves part. Thou break'st the spell; as when the Spring Returns to cheer our sight; And, in her train, doth with her bring The flowers, our chief delight; She calls them, with her gentle voice, And bids their tribes appear; With southern fields our own rejoice, For Spring again is here! A bond thou art 'twixt state and state, A link in Nature's chain; That doth man's written laws out date, That ever shall remain; To tell us of God's boundless love To all of human kind; And, like the Gospel from above, Their hearts in one to bind. Poem No. 108; 20 January 1869 Things Unseen With higher thoughts, O God, uplift My sinking, feeble mind; And let it, in the things unseen,. Its rest and portion find. For these are real;âthough the world Doth not in them believe; Can worldly, carnal-minded men The things of God receive? Such things the Spirit doth reveal, Things, like Itself, divine; Oh that they might more real grow, And be forever mine. Around my spirit ever breathe A calm, and holy joy; Which earthly cares might not disturb, Nor human power destroy. Into my darkened spirit shine, With ever brightening ray; Till gone each cloud, which dims my sight, And come the perfect day. That thus I might, with truth and power, To others too declare, How great, how vast eternal things! How wondrous and how fair! Poem No. 836; c. 30 January 1869 The Oak And The Poplar There grew upon a sandy hill An oak and poplar tree; The oak seemed almost to stand still, Its growth you scarce could see; For years its strong, and stubborn roots Were burrowing 'neath the ground, While on its trunk no lofty shoots, Nor spreading limbs were found. The poplar shot up tall and fast, And looked around with pride; And o'er the oak its shadow cast, As 'twould its neighbor hide; Its bright leaves glittered in the sun, And danced in every breeze; From all it admiration won; While none the oak could please. A century passed.âThe tardy oak Had reared its head on high, And praise, and reverence bespoke From every passer by; A hundred arms it had outspread, Its thick, and gnarled form Seemed not the lightning's bolt to dread, Nor fear the wildest storm! Fit for man's use, it waiting stood To rib the stout ship's side; And bear him safely o'er the flood, Without its aid denied; Or form, with timbers tough and strong, His dwelling's massive frame; That should protect the builder long, And still hand down his name. And there, around the parent tree, A thousand younger stood; That, age on age, for man should be A magazine of wood; And, on its boughs, the acorns still In countless numbers hung, The falling forest's place to fill, And keep it ever young. The quick-grown poplar long had ceased To be remembered there, The old men told, âhow it increased, And flourished once so fair; That many nurseries were made, 'Twas planted through the town, And much admired for growth and shade, But short-lived its renown! For soonâ, they said, âits tender frame The blustering winds o'erthrew;â And now 'tis scarcely known by name, Where once in pride it grew. Poem No. 611; 6 March 1869 The Yellow Violets In a broad, grassy field, By the old turnpike's side; Once grew a bed of fairest flowers, Of early Spring the pride. Close to the craggy hill, And near a walnut tree; Those lilies fair, though years have fled, I seem again to see! Amidst green, speckled leaves, The graceful flowers were found; Each, pendant on a slender stem, Bent gazing on the ground. With playmates there I strayed, When April days had come; To search for buds, or opening flowers, And bear my treasures home. But, like my childhood's hours, Their beauty now is fled; Their flowers no more the field adorn, And hid their lowly bed. The grassy field's destroyed, Where they so long had grown; And the yellow violet now no more By the children there is known! Poem No. 297; c. 4 May 1869 The City of God How strange the thought, that in the very light Of God's own city we may walking be; That holy city, where there is no night, Nor yet the light, nor those about us see! Its music, too, may fall upon the ear, Celestial strains from the angelic choirs; No soul-entrancing melody we hear, For naught divine the heavenly strain inspires. Without a warning, save a voice from heaven, The holy city doth to earth descend; To all alike its light is freely given, And men and angels do their voices blend; But oft, alas, within its streets we tread, Nor know that to its scenes our souls are dead! Poem No. 202; c. 5 June 1869 The Scholar Dreaming Gazing, listless, from his book Doth the scholar outward look, Through the window, far away, At the close of summer day. Objects bright and fair he sees, Feels the cool, refreshing breeze; Which doth from the meadow blow, Bending all its surface low. Sees the rocky hills so steep, Where he longs to climb and leap; Hears the songs of birds so free, As they sport from tree to tree. Strange the words upon the page, They no more his mind engage; School and books unreal seem, They have vanished like a dream! Chide not, Teacher, chide him not, Though his lesson be forgot; Nature takes him by the hand, He her words can understand. Follow too her wiser plan, Let the child instruct the man; All his nature learn to train, Or thy toil may prove in vain. Through long years, the mind will grow Ere its stature it shall know; Soon the body's height is gained, And its fullest powers attained. Give him motives pure and high, Point to earth, and sea, and sky; Let him far and wide explore Hill, and field, and rocky shore. Give the body health and strength, That it may not fail at length; That the ever-active mind May a fit companion find. Poem No. 144; c. 29 June 1869 Hymn Sung at the Dedication of the Peabody Academy of Science, Salem, Aug. 18, 1869. The noble hall our fathers planned, Where gathered were the rich and rare; From every clime, and every land, And long preserved with faithful care; To Science now we dedicate, That doth all Nature's realms explore; New ways through continents create, And cables stretch from shore to shore. And higher still, on soaring wing, The great Creative Thought would find; And study, in each living thing, The end for which it was designed. That it may serve the lot of man, And to the race a blessing prove; Unfold the universal plan Of God's beneficence, and love. Honor to him, who, far and wide, For these high ends his wealth bestows; Which, like some mighty river's tide, Through all our land exhaustless flows. Poem No. 534; c. 18 August 1869 Spiritual Darkness A darkness, like the middle of the night, Clouds in the morn, and e'en the mid day hours; Men wander round, as if devoid of sight, Or led astray by false deluding powers. The wise knew not its coming, nor can tell Whence fell this darkness, like a plague, on all; In vain they seek by knowledge to dispel The gloom, that shrouds the earth as with a pall! The astronomer the sun's eclipse foretells, The day and hour, when quenched his glorious ray; The moment, when his arrowy beam dispels The sudden night, and brings returning day; But who the dark eclipses of the mind Can thus predict? by calculation find? Poem No. 4; c. 9 October 1869 Friendship How sweet the memory of a friend, Whom now we meet no more! How oft his looks do we recall, Repeat his sayings o'er. The places where with him we strayed, The meadow, grove, and hill; How oft we picture them to view, And with fond memories fill! Sad are our hearts, that now no more His face, his form we see; When we frequent the much-loved spots, Where he was wont to be. As wandering there the things we see All seem to us more fair Each thing he loved each flower &amp; tree When he was with us there. Each well-remembered object makes His image more complete; Till earthly trials, sorrows past, With him again we meet. Poem No. 204; c. 1 January 1870 The Sparrows And The Crop of Weeds Think not yon tall, rank growth of weeds A useless crop is found; Though man himself has sowed no seeds, Nor tilled the fertile ground. Though he neglect, as here we see, The primal, great command; Nor grain, nor plant, nor bush, nor tree, Is witness of his hand. For He, who all things, small and great, Includes in one vast plan; Did humble sparrows too create, As well as nobler man. He shelters them through winter's night, So long, and drear, and cold; In swamp, or wood, till morning light; As shepherd keeps his fold. And still the earth brings forth the weed, Man's idleness to shame; The birds in wintry time to feed, Who naught from him can claim. Thus doth the Lord for these provide, Who neither sow nor reap; Nor to the smallest is denied His care, who all doth keep. Poem No. 652; 15 February 1870 Ye have hoarded up treasure in the last days.âJames 5:3. Bring forth your gold and silver! They shall be But as the dust that meets the passing eye; You shall from all your idols break; be free! And worship Him who made earth, sea and sky! Ye who have hid within your learned pelf, Ye who in gold alone your riches see, Bring forth your idols! they are born of Self, Nor longer in their worship bow the knee. Each secret thing must now be brought to light, For soon the day breaks on your hidden spoil; Go, buy what then will give your souls delight, Nor longer for earth's treasures vainly toil; For each man's work must now be tried by fire, Which shall consume each selfish, wrong desire. Poem No. 81; c. 26 February 1870 Hymn The Spiritual Body Clothed upon with house from heaven, See each bush and naked tree; Unto us an image given Of man's immortality! Still the spirit needs a covering, When the fleshly garment fails; Like the snow flakes downward hovering, It the new-born spirit veils. Many a soiled, and time-worn raiment Suddenly is laid aside; And the humble, earthly claimant With new body glorified! Clothed is the weary spirit With immortal vigor strong, Angels' nature doth inherit, Powers that unto them belong. Not in vain the Resurrection Doth the Church forever preach; Nature doth to our reflection The same wondrous lesson teach. In the insect's new-found pinions, Breaking from its sealÃ©d tomb; Heir of Summer's bright dominions, Freed from winter's death and gloom; In the grain of wheat, which springeth With new beauty from the ground; In the pure, white robe, that clingeth Unto shrub, and tree around. Poem No. 87; c. 9 April 1870 Hymn The Efficacy of a Mother's Prayer Pray, mother, for thy prayer may keep Thy child in virtue's way; A blessed harvest he shall reap, For whom thou oft dost pray. 'Twill bless him in his early days, And consecrate his home; 'Twill bless him mid the world's rough ways, And wheresoe'er he roam. Through manhood e'en to life's last close, Thy prayers shall council, guide; Keep pure his heart from deadly foes, From hatred, lust, and pride. Pray, mother, for thy prayer has power To help, to save thy child; To give him strength in evil hour, By pleasure's voice beguiled. And pray, O pray, when erring, frail, Thy feeble child may fall; Thy prayer, thy faith may still prevail, And back to life recall! For God the prayer of faith doth hear, And answer from on high; To those who seek Him, He is near, Nor will their quest deny. Poem No. 400; c. 9 July 1870 The Fireflies The Summer's day has reached its close, The darkness settles round; The weary mower seeks repose, And sinks in sleep profound. But o'er the field of new-mown hay, Behold a wondrous sight! Though gone the brightness of the day, The air is full of light. Like sparkles, glancing to and fro Among the new-mown grass, The fireflies gleam; how strange the show! As back and forth they pass; Each with a lamp, like human kind; They seek perchance their food; Or, by its light, each other find, As suits their varying mood. Or, hiding them from dangerous foe, They darken now its ray; That none their secret path may know, And seize them for their prey. How marvelous the works of God, His wisdom, skill, and power! In starry hosts or glittering sod, In insect, plant, or flower. Oh may I not, whereere I turn, Careless his works behold; But from each thing some lesson learn, Which He to man has told. Poem No. 576; c. 19 July 1870 Be Not Many Teachers James 3:1. âBe ye not many teachers; for we all,â The Apostle wrote, âin many things offend;â His admonition let us oft recall, As words of wisest teacher, and of friend. âBe ye not many teachersâ. First receive The gift of Wisdom, ere ye claim to teach; And first the Gospel's glorious truths believe, Before that Gospel ye to others preach. We all offend. Confession humble, meek, To those who would instruct their fellow men; That they may ever grace, and wisdom seek To guide their speech; whether of tongue, or pen; Lest they, as teachers, labor but in vain, And but the greater condemnation gain! Poem No. 62; c. 6 August 1870 Military surprises and the capture of capitals, are the events of a by-gone age. D'Israeli. A by-gone age appears again, Though gone its weapons, spear and shield; Men's baser passions still the same, Will the same fatal harvest yield. Yea, deadlier weapons they contrive, As aided by Satanic skill; More wide destruction's bolts to hurl, And with a surer aim to kill. The march of armies trampling down The harvests raised by care and toil, The works of noblest skill destroyed, And cities burnt, or given to spoil; Homes made forever sad and lone, For children in the battle slain; These are the scenes of which we read, A by-gone age appears again! Ambition grasping wider power, Involving nations in its plan, Musters its hosts; appeals to arms; Regarding neither God nor man. The pomp and circumstance of war No more the statesman's thoughts engage; He views them but as idle shows, The relics of a barbarous age; Restored to deck despotic rule, With semblance of its ancient power; Its prestige and its name prolong Beyond the fixed, allotted hour. Poem No. 1; c. 9 September 1870 The Bible Does Not Sanction Polygamy I. The Word of God doth sanction nothing ill, Nor low, nor base; whatever men may find Written of old. The letter oft doth kill, Or to the grovelling Past the spirit bind. So they, who once did Slavery uphold, Found in the Bible sanction for their deed; Their hearts more hardened like the King of old, When Israel was from Egypt's bondage freed. So War, twin-relic of a barbarous age, Claims too the sanction of the Holy Word; And nations still in hostile strife engage, And call themselves the followers of the Lord! The Spirit only quickens; gives the light, That we may read the Word of God aright. II. A loftier state of purity and bliss, Than this man's mortal lot doth yet unfold; In the new life, which shall succeed to this, Was by the Savior to mankind foretold; The Resurrection;âwhen no more we die, Nor parted are by time, or cruel fate; But as the angels are, who dwell on high; And, made immortal, share their deathless state! There soul meets soul, and heart to heart is known, Nor sundered are the ties, which spirits bind; There none is ere compelled to walk alone, Or lacks the fellowship of kindred mind; Would that such purity we now might share, And for that blissful state might here prepare! Poem No. 600; c. 16 September 1870 Bitter-Sweet Rocks There is no spot so lonely, rough, and wild, But Nature doth, with careful fingers, deck With flowers, or vines, or ferns, or soft green moss, To give to those, who to such haunts may stray, A sweet surprise, a pleasure all their own. To such a spot, an unfrequented dell, When Autumn comes, some warm October day, I love to wander, and in silence muse. O'er rocky hills, where cattle roam and feed, Cropping the meadows and the pastures green, My way I take; pausing at times to view The city's spires, or ocean's blue expanse; Then down the narrow glen, shady and still, Save when some startled bird has taken to flight, Or cricket's song amid the grass is heard. Here from the cliff whose vast rocks have fallen, Thrown down by some convulsion, or by frost; And at its base lie in confusion piled. But not neglected doth this ruin lie, For here a beauteous show hath Nature wrought For those, who to this lonely spot have come. Among these broken rocks the bitter-sweet Has taken root, and clasped the fragments round In close embrace, covering the mossy rocks With leafy screen; where clustering bunches hang Of purest gold. And, sight most beautiful! As Nature sought yet more to please and charm; Up to the very top of a high tree, Which rooted grows amid'st the fallen crags, A vine has clomb; and every bough and twig Is laden with its golden berries ripe, And from the top in gay festoons they hang; Giving a wondrous beauty to the place. Poem No. 627; c. 31 October 1870 Humanity Mourning For Her Children Slain In War Humanity laments, and still will weep Her slaughtered sons of every age and clime; And hourly doth her fasts and vigils keep, For millions perished since the birth of time! And shall she never from the dust arise, And put her robe of fleecy whiteness on; And dry her swollen and ever flowing eyes For wrongs, that man his brother man has done? Yes; for though passing clouds now dim her sight, They shall not long prevent the approaching day; Already are the hill-tops glad with light, And man's proud tyrants starting with dismay. Soon shall she see her children dwell in peace On all the earth, of every name and clime; Their friendly intercourse of love increase, Unfettered by the bonds of space and time. A deep, abiding joy her soul shall fill, Beholding thus her countless children blest; Secure from rude alarms, and every ill, And entering here on their eternal rest! Poem No. 205; c. 15 November 1870 The Poor Clergyman Long had Christ's servant preached the word of truth, And labored in the vineyard of his Lord; But gone his strength, his manhood, and his youth, And age had come;âbut what was his reward? Men had forgot the laborer; rich had grown, And added house to house, and land to land; The truth he preached forgot, or never known; Like those who heard, but did not understand. Perhaps, neglected, in some poorhouse he Might linger out his days, they never knew; Or homeless roam in bitter poverty, While they each day, and year the richer grew; The riches of this world to them were given, To him the treasure that's laid up in heaven! Poem No. 320; c. 13 December 1870 The Teaching Of History Confirmed Why look we to the distant past to learn Lessons of wisdom from the days gone by? When to the living present we may turn, And read the teaching of all History. Behold a mighty city, boasting all That wealth, or splendor, or renown can give, Encompassed now by armies, soon to fall; No more the glory of the world to live! One moment on the pinnacle of fame, Another humbled to the very dust; How vain the prestige of a Conqueror's name! In arm of flesh how vain to place our trust! And not in arts, whose glory shall endure, By which great nations dwell in peace secure. Poem No. 822; c. 7 January 1871 Childhood's Songs âAll the songs of my childhood float back to me, and I wander in far off realms.â âWilliam E. Clark. I hear again my childhood's songs, When life was bright and fair; Their melodies my spirit hears, They float upon the air. In far off realms I seem to stray, Mid childhood's early flowers; And all my weariness forget, Amid its happy bowers. My mother's voice, it comes again So clear, and pure, and sweet; I seem a child again to be, And listening at her feet! They cheer and soothe my sinking heart, As if from heaven they came; In manhood, as in youthful hours, Their power is still the same. A power to purify and bless, And thus my soul prepare; With those I loved in early days, The life of heaven to share. Poem No. 237; c. 18 March 1871 Hymn, Sung at the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Essex Historical Society, Salem. April 21, 1871. Amid the swift onrushing years, We hear a voice that bids us stay; Back to the storied Past we turn, And reverently its call obey. For not dissevered, weak, alone, Do we amid the Present live; But to our lives the by-gone days Their knowledge, and their virtues give. Made wise by wisdom of the Past, We for the Future shall prepare; Sharing our Fathers' noble aims, We shall their fame, and glory share. But soon forgotten, or destroyed, The records of that early age; Had not their sons with loving care, Memorials left for History's page. Honor we give to those, who here Recorded for our use their lore; Whose names, and virtues we revere, Though seen with us their forms no more! Inspired by their example high, May we their chosen path pursue; Alike to Present, and to Past, In all our thoughts, and acts be true. Poem No. 38; c. 21 April 1871 The Lessons of History Unlearned Again doth France, unhappy France, behold Renewed the scenes of terror and of crime; Still unprepared for Freedom, as of old, Though passed almost a century of time. Of her long history how sad the end, Freedom by King and People both betrayed! While faction doth the boastful city rend, And for another age is Peace delayed. So doth a noble river, that should bless And fertilize its banks on either side, Bursting its bounds, bring ruin and distress, And desolate a happy region wide! Ah, when shall man, if not by reason taught, Learn from the wondrous works in Nature wrought? Poem No. 27; c. 16 June 1871 The Fulness of The Gentiles Swift speeds the time, the time long since foretold, When all the nations shall be gathered in; The scroll of Prophecy be all unrolled, And a new Age, a grander Age begin. By signs the day its coming doth portend, In swifter intercourse the nations meet, Old dynasties are hastening to their end, The electric wire its circuits doth complete. O Love, that did the Apostle's bosom swell, And gave him knowledge of the mystery high, And fitting words, that mystery to tell; Would that like him, we saw Christ's Kingdom nigh! Come, Church Triumphant! in thy glory come; And gather all earth's weary children home! Poem No. 453; c. 8 July 1871 To a Cloud Whither, O Cloud! with richest treasures fraught, From some unseen, and distant regions brought; Whither so swiftly dost thou wing thy way, And why not o'er this dusty city stay? The grass is withered, and the flowers are dead, From our fair gardens all their beauty fled; And e'en the lofty trees, with foliage dry, Imploring look as thou art passing by. We know not why so swift thou passest on, For, while we gaze, thou from our sight art gone! Like glorious angel hastening to fulfil, On pinions swift the great Creator's will. How small our knowledge of the mighty plan Controuling nature, since the world began! Vainly would Science search the hidden cause, Which wings thy flight, obedient to His laws; Who fillest all things, and dost all contain, Who sendeth, or withholds alike the rain. Perhaps, beyond our own horizon's bound, More needing thee, more dry and parched the ground; And, with more earnest prayers, more anxious eyes, Men turn their gaze unto the cloudless skies. O'er the proud city thou wilt not remain, Where dwell the sons of pleasure, and of gain; But, where the toiling husbandman doth stand, And mourning views his crops, his parched land, Thou hastenest on; and drop'st thy fulness down, And dost his toil, and prayers with plenty crown. Poem No. 813; c. 1 September 1871 The Child's Dream of Reaching the Horizon A child beheld the o'er arching heaven, Where earth blends with the sky; And longed to reach the blissful spot, It seemed to him so nigh. All night he could not sleep a wink, As on his bed he lay; And a bright day in June beheld The dreamer on his way. Not e'en his parents did he tell For what, and where he went; Lest they should laugh his thoughts to scorn, And his fond hopes prevent. Thus onward, on a summer's morn, To earth's fair bound he sped; And yet whene'er he reached the spot, The blissful vision fled. It was not where the hill he climbed, Nor on the meadow green; Nor where on the horizon's line, The silver brook was seen. Nor where the forest's branches waved, And the birds sang so sweet; He came; but reached not there the place, Where heaven and earth did meet. Ah, many a weary mile he went To reach the bending sky, But found at last 'twas still afar, What he had dreamed so nigh. Some laborers found the wandering child, And homeward turned his face; With slow, and toilsome steps once more His path did he retrace. Glad were his parents, when at eve, He safely reached his home; But sad the child; the dream had fled, Which called his feet to roam! Poem No. 2; c. 2 September 1871 Lead Me To The Rock That Is Higher Than I In a barren land I wander, And no tree, nor house I spy; Lead me to a Rock for refuge, Rock that higher is than I. Fierce the sun has beat upon me From a burning, cloudless sky; Friendly shadow now I long for, Rock that higher is than I. Strange and wild the scenes around me, And no help from man is nigh; But a shelter Thou canst show me, Rock that higher is than I. Treacherous guides have me forsaken, Many paths deceive my eye; Thou alone canst guide, and show me Rock that higher is than I. Night is falling dark &amp; dreary, Help me, or I sink and die! Show me, ere the light shall fail me, Rock that higher is than I. Then my soul shall sing thy praises, And extol thy mercies high; Praise and bless, through endless ages, Rock that higher is than I. Poem No. 296; c. 18 November 1871 Forevermore A sad refrain I heard, from poet sad, Which on my soul with deadening weight did fall; But quick another word, which made me glad, Did from the heavens above me seem to call. The first was Nevermore: which, like a knell, Struck on my ear with dull, funereal sound; The last was Evermore; which like a bell, In waves of music filled the air around. Forevermore with loved and lost to be, No more to suffer change, nor grief, nor pain, From partings sad to be forever free,â Such was that sweet bell's music; its refrain Blended with voices from the heavenly shore, Each whispering to my heart Forevermore. Poem No. 18; c. 24 November 1871 Man's First Experience of Winter When man, born 'mid luxuriant Tropic bowers, Beheld, 'neath northern skies, all Nature change; The falling leaves, the dying grass and flowers,â How desolate the sight! the scene how strange! And when the sun declined, and Winter's breath Had frozen hard the river's rapid tide, And spread o'er hills and fields the pall of death,â Feared he not then, that Nature's self had died? Yet in his heart a faith and trust did spring, Faith conquering doubt, and trust in Power Divine; That from this seeming death new life would bring, And clothe again the tree, the grass, the vine; And banish from the earth dark Winter's gloom, And bid her hills and fields with beauty bloom. Poem No. 791; c. 6 February 1872 Interpreting God's Ways Interpret not God's ways, unless his light Has shone upon thy dark, beclouded mind, Making earth's scenes of sin and suffering bright, That thou his way, his perfect way, may'st find. Boast not thy knowledge of old Nature's laws, Though thou may'st something of her secrets know; Canst thou explain her being, or her cause? Tell how a single blade of grass doth grow? Or knowest thou how thine eye, or cunning hand, Doth execute its work with nicest skill? Canst thou the mind's swift motions understand, Make all its movements subject to thy will? Boast not thy knowledge, though, with angel's sight, Thine eye could pierce the darkness as the light. Poem No. 302; c. 10 February 1872 I Prayed, Thy Kingdom Come I prayed, Thy kingdom come! For Winter long Had held the frozen earth in fetters bound; And wretchedness, and misery, war, and wrong, Age after age, did in the world abound. I prayed, Thy kingdom come! And lo, the Spring Came with its warmth and joy to glad the earth; New hope the sight did to my spirit bring, That Man at length should share the quickening birth. For He who worketh thus great Nature's change, Works in the heart his miracles of power; Than those we see more marvellous and strange! Have faith in God, and wait his promised hour; For He who doth the quickening Spring-time send, Will sin destroy, bring suffering to an end. Poem No. 251; c. 20 April 1872 Justification By Faith Strongly did Luther seize the mighty thought, Which the Apostle's mind had first conceived, And which in him so mightily had wrought, That he is Justified, who hath believed; Freed from the observance of the Jewish law, Which sought by fear man's nature to controul; From higher motives did his thoughts withdraw, And bound to forms and rites the aspiring soul. By faith, and not by works, man lives; he said; And, by his word, the nation's bondage broke! From land to land quickly the tidings spread, To life and thought the slumbering people woke! From slavish forms, and slavish errors free, And standing firm in Christian liberty. Poem No. 448; c. 4 May 1872 The First of May May has come, but flowers are rare, Blooming only here and there, In some sheltered, sunny spot, Where the bleak winds reach them not. Still the pastures pale and dry With no verdure greet the eye, Only on the turnpike seen Narrow borders touched with green. E'en the savins, hardy band, Winter-killed and blasted stand; And their green has yellow turned, As by fire their boughs were burned. But the children, on the hill Love to keep the May-day still; Love to search the fields around, Though no flowers by them are found. In vain they ask of passer-by, Where is the anemony? Where the violet's deep blue? None can show them, but the few, Who their favorite haunts may know, And can tell them where to go. There, though Spring elsewhere delays, Each their beauteous tints displays; And upon the breeze their bloom Sheds its delicate perfume. Call not then the custom vain, For to seek is still to gain: Though we find not that we prize, In the seeking pleasure lies. They who seek shall ever find Health of body and of mind; They who will not ask, nor seek, Live in mind and body weak. Poem No. 325; 1â7 May 1872 On the Great Divisions of the Christian Church, The Catholic, the Protestant, and the Greek Still other sheep Thou hast, O Shepherd fair, Than that one flock to which we may belong; For all alike Thou dost provide and care, And call them by thy voice, and tuneful song. Though they, estranged, may not each other know, And deem their fold, and theirs alone, is thine; Thou dost to all the heavenly pastures show, And watch and guard them all with love divine. O that thy Church again might be but one, One Shepherd and one flock, as once of old! That Thou the wanderers who astray have gone, And all the lost, might gather to thy fold; That they, with thine, might in green pastures feed, From want, and fear, and every danger freed. Poem No. 440; c. 8 June 1872 The Nine O'Clock Bell 'Tis ânine o'clock;â but few the summons heed; The street is full of passers to and fro; No homes they seek, no homes they seem to need; And some, alas! a home may never know. They hear no voice of father, mother dear, To bid them âsure return, when rings the bell;â In its loud tones no friendly signal hear Of household cares, and loving hearts to tell. Trained in a different school the people now No steady habits, nor obedience gain. To keep good hours, when duty calls to go, Are all forgot for pleasure, feasting, gain. Ring on Old Bell! and from their ways recall Gay, thoughtless youth, and warn them lest they fall! Poem No. 726; c. 12 July 1872 âAre there Few that be Saved?â Luke 13:23. So questioned one of old, as we Do often anxious ask; And from our work we look around, Forgetting our own task. We see the busy multitudes, That throng the world's highway; We see the multitudes that meet To worship and to pray. Shall few, or shall all men be saved? We question, too, the Lord; But the same answer we receive, As he who heard his word. Strive earnestly to enter in God's kingdom, given to all; And while thou hear'st the Gospel preached, Obey its gracious call. Look not around, nor curious be To learn another's fate; But rather strive thyself to gain An entrance ere too late. When once the Master of the House Has risen, and shut the door, In vain they seek to enter in Who welcomed were before. For many then shall stand without, And wait, and knock in vain; Who, if they strove to enter now, Might easy entrance gain. Poem No. 426; c. 24 August 1872 On Seeing the White Mountains from Cook's Hill, in West Peabody Far off I see, like a dim cloud, the hills, Which, in my youth, I climbed with daring feet; Whose memory still my mind with grandeur fills, And pleasant thoughts of love and friendship sweet. But nearer do the humble hill-tops rise, On which my childhood loved to sit and stray; Gazing on pastures wide, on sea and skies, Lit by the sun's bright beams, or moon's soft ray. And many a merry voice and sunny face Of early playmates round my happy home Come back to me, as the green paths I trace, And craggy cliffs, 'mid which we loved to roam; Nor long I now yon distant hills to climb, Though grand their scenes, their summits more sublime. Poem No. 115; c. 30 August 1872 Signs in the Natural World The earth doth with the heavens sympathise! When, by the civil war, our land was rent, Scorched was the ground, and from the cloudless skies The sun blazed fierce, no rain from heaven was sent: Now, filled with vapor is the summer sky, And drenched with frequent rains the needy ground; On their dread errands oft the lightnings fly, And echoes through heaven's vault the thunder's sound. But dull the eye of sense, and dull its ear Unto these signs; that wake the listening soul; That doth in Nature more than Nature hear, That sees the Hand that doth her powers controul; And feels that earth and man, and sea and sky Are bound in one by hidden sympathy. Poem No. 491; c. 5 October 1872 A Walk in Harmony Grove I walked the grove where rest the mortal forms Of those we love, and still with tears deplore; Unheard as yet the blasts of Winter's storms, And still the trees their thickest foliage wore; But through the forest came a soft, sad sound, As Nature were attuned to human grief; And, fluttering from the trees unto the ground, In frequent showers fell many a dying leaf. How oft does Nature speak unto the soul, But we, alas! have not the listening ear; In falling leaf, as in the mighty whole, She speaks to man, would he her voices hear; In sober Autumn, as in joyous spring, To souls attuned she doth instruction bring. Poem No. 282; c. 22 October 1872 The Prayer of Jabez The prayer of Jabez, too, should be our prayer: âKeep me from evil, that it may not grieve.â How hard the sight of wrong and ill to bear, When we cannot the sufferers relieve! The child of sorrow, he for others' woe, As if it were his own, did deeply feel; Though he had naught of riches to bestow, Nor power their wrongs and miseries to heal. God heard his prayer, and answered his request; And by his sympathy, did help impart Unto the poor, the suffering, and opprest, That healed their wounds and robbed them of their smart; Nor suffered cruel deeds, nor words unkind To grieve his heart, or rankle in his mind. Poem No. 543; c. 9 November 1872 The Life of the Flower Know'st thou the life of a single flower, How it blooms from out the earth? Whence came its beauty? and what the Power, That gave its beauty birth? How long has the seed of that flower been sown, In the ages past away; Since first on the earth its form was known, And it oped to the light of day? In the hardened rock its form is found, Ere man the earth had trod; Ere his toiling hands had tilled the ground, Or sowed with its seed the sod. Before the bird, or the beast was made, The desolate earth still in gloom; Ere a tree o'er the dry land had spread its shade, Did the flower in its beauty bloom. Thou may'st trace its life to the single cell, By the aid which Science gives; But can'st thou by searching the secret tell, Whence the seed, or how it lives? Oh no: for the secret is hid from thee, Known to none save the Perfect Mind; Whom thou in his works alone can see, But not to perfection find. For the life of the flower, like the life of the soul, Is hid in God above; And the humblest flower, like the mighty Whole, Sprang forth from his boundless love. Poem No. 313; c. 28 December 1872 The Old Danvers Burying-Ground Above the ancient burying place Looks calmly down the full orbed moon; Each well known grave I plainly trace, As in the effulgent light of noon. And through the cold, transparent air, The stars and planets brightly glow, As if they listened to the prayer Of dweller on this sphere below. And is there not some secret spell, Some influence from yon shining spheres; Of the Immortal Life to tell Beyond Time's few and fleeting years? There is; for though no voice nor speech May reach the mourner's listening ear, The Resurrection's truth they teach, By revelation's words made clear. That though the mortal body die, A nobler, fairer, shall succeed; As stars in differing glory vie, As springs the stalk from buried seed. That as the earthly now we wear, Subject to suffering, change, decay; The heavenly image we shall bear, That fadeth not, like that, away. There is no death in scene like this, Though mortal forms repose around; My thoughts mount upward to the bliss The immortal soul with God has found. All live to Him! Though earth may hide The forms of loved ones from our sight; Our friends still live, with Him abide, Who on the grave sheds holy light. Poem No. 25a; c. 18 February 1873 Hymn âHe that loveth not, knoweth not God.â He loveth not! he knows not God! For God himself is love; And dwelleth with his children here, And in the heavens above. To Him they pray to cleanse their hearts From every guilty stain; Nor is a single cry unheard, Nor prayer breathed forth in vain. His Spirit too doth in us dwell, And teaches us to pray; Though we from fear, or doubt, or sin, May know not what to say. It teaches others to forgive, As we would be forgiven; That we God's children here may be, And dwell with Him in heaven. It strengthens in temptation's hour, When worldly foes assail; And gives us courage strong to stand, And o'er them all prevail. Pray, pray for those who know not God, Nor ask his help in prayer; That they may know the Father's love, And in his kingdom share. Poem No. 162; c. 8 March 1873 Norman's Rocks Along the base of Norman's Rocks I stroll, as when a boy; Or climb their steep and craggy sides The prospect to enjoy; Or feel the cool, refreshing breeze, Which round their summit plays; And makes this hill a favorite haunt, In the warm Summer days. This pleasant height a prospect gives O'er fields, and pastures green; While, on the far horizon's line, The ocean's blue is seen. Below, the city stretches far, With many a shady street; And all its homes, and gardens fair Lie smiling at its feet. More beautiful to me the scene, Than painter's canvass shows; For this in memory's brightest hues, And fancy's colors glows. Here did I climb, when Spring returned, To pluck her earliest flowers; Or mid the golden woodwax play, In Summer's sultry hours. Here picked the barberry's bunches red, When Autumn time had come; Or sought the bitter-sweet to deck With gay festoons my home. Though to the scene the musing mind Doth its own coloring give; Yet doth the prospect charm the more, The longer still I live. The lichens clinging to the rocks, The moss forever green, The saxifrage, with milk-white flowers, The first in childhood seen; Still many a pleasing lesson have, As on their leaves I pore; New beauties charm in manhood's prime, Ne'er seen in years before. For Science opens wide her book, And bids her children read, With wonder filled the hidden life In flower and plant and seed. And still the varying seasons bring An ever new delight; As from these cliffs I look around On each familiar sight; A picture that can never fade, While life and memory last; Made soft and fair by loveliest hues, Reflected from the past. Poem No. 35; c. 20 June 1873 On visiting the beautiful estate of H. H. Hunnewell, Esq., at Wellesley. We wandered hours amid a lovely scene, Which every moment brought a fresh surprise; So beautiful the flowers, the grass so green, It seemed like Paradise unto our eyes. Is this all nature's work? or has man's art, By nature taught, but perfected her plan? So blended are they each in every part, We know not nature's work from work of man. What level lawns! what vistas opening fine Through shady groves! with forest-fringed lake; Which, in one whole, do every charm combine, And soul and sense, as willing captives, take; Which a new sense of nature's beauty give, That in the grateful mind will ever live. Poem No. 765; c. 1 July 1873 The Revelation of The Spirit Through The Material World We call material this fair world of ours, And so it seems to gross, material eyes; That see no beauty in earth's fairest flowers, No heavenly splendors in her sunset skies. But are there not, in yonder gorgeous scene, A beauty and a grandeur not of earth; A glory breaking from yon cloudy screen Revealing to the soul its nobler birth? Can things material such fair forms assume, And thus delight and charm the human mind; Or doth the Spirit with its rays illume Their inmost depths, from matter now refined; That man may thus with it communion hold, And learn of higher things than sense has told? Poem No. 760; c. 26 July 1873 And a little child shall lead them. Isaiah XI. 6. Thou call'st me, little child, With thy voice sweet and mild, To go with thee; I take thy guiding hand, For thou the happy land Dost clearly see. The land, where heard no more The lion's angry roar; Nor beast of prey Doth ravage and devour; And gone the tyrant's power, To hurt, and slay. The fields and pastures green Through all the year are seen, No drought they know; There flowers of beauty rare, Without man's fostering care, Abundant grow. There in a peaceful life, Forgotten war's rude strife, All men shall live; No enemy shall spoil, Earth without painful toil, Shall plenty give. There nevermore is heard Harsh speech, nor angry word; No more we hear Of deeds of shame and crime, Darkening the page of time; Nor dwell in fear. No sorrow there shall be, New heavens and earth we'll see, Where dwelleth Love; There, there, O gentle guide, May I with thee abide, Blest land above. Poem No. 666; c. 16 August 1873 The Blessing of Rain How, like a blessing, falls the rain On thirsty field, and parched hill, And on the dry, and dusty plain, Low swamp and pool the rain drops fill. They wash the tall tree's withering leaves And fresh the forest's branches wave; The dying shrub the gift receives, That comes its feeble life to save. The birds their painful silence break, And fill with joyful notes the grove; The cattle now their thirst can slake, Nor for a spring they vainly rove. A pleasant smell the moist earth sends To heaven for the reviving shower; Which with unnumbered odors blends, The incense sweet of many a flower. And man, with every living thing, With grateful heart his voice doth lift In praise to God; and thanks doth bring For every good and perfect gift. Poem No. 189; c. 26 August 1873 On the Mountain Ash Tree In front of the house of the late Capt. Robert W. Gould He planted, years ago, before his door, A mountain ash; which now a tree has grown, And year by year its golden berries bore. Could it to him who planted have been known, How much more beautiful his home would be In years to come! How much of joy and grace The leaves, and flowers, and fruit of this one tree, Would give to passers-by, and to the place? Well I remember, passing through the street, When but a boy, its beauty caught my eye; And often now I pause the tree to greet, As on my daily walk I pass it by; Nor doth it fail, in winter cold, and drear, With clustering berries red the eye to cheer. Poem No. 164; c. 21 October 1873 October How beautiful the sight of woods still fair, That yet no heavy frost, nor rain has harmed; And warm as summer is the autumn air, As by some spell its chilly winds were charmed! Still blooms the golden rod in many a glade, And asters open still their mild blue eyes; The Spring beyond its season long delayed, The added warmth of Autumn well supplies. 'Tis pleasant, 'mid the grove's rich colored light, Along its paths with musing mind to stray; And meditate on Autumn's glories bright, Which fully compensate the Spring's delay; Learning a lesson of the varied year Of patience, trust, and hope the heart to cheer. Poem No. 177; October 1873 The Mound Builders. On Reading the work of the late J. W. Foster Strange record of a people past away, Once numerous as the leaves the forests shed, As mindful of man's frailty, and decay, Upon their mounds, and grave-hills of their dead. Here lived, and planned, and toiled another race, A pre-historic race, forgotten long; Who in the speech of men have left no trace, Unknown alike to history, and to song. Yet were they to ourselves, as men, allied, In God's own image made, though of the earth; And, though the help of Learning's stores denied, Destined with us to an immortal birth. With reverence may we ope their graves, and tread With thoughtful minds the cities of the dead. Poem No. 444 c. 1 November 1873 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted. How hard the truth of words like these to feel, To realize a promise such as this! Yet have they balm the heart's deep wounds to heal, That mourns the loss of friends, and earthly bliss. For they were spoke by him, who knew our lot, A sorrowing man, who felt, and shared our grief; Who ne'er the lowliest sufferer forgot, To whom his mighty power could bring relief. Still, from on high, the Comforter he sends, That fills with joy and peace the lonely heart; As once he gave unto his dearest friends, That should abide with them, and ne'er depart. Oh that earth's sorrowing children all might know The Heavenly Gift the Savior doth bestow! Poem No. 187; c. 12 December 1873 There shall be one Flock, one Shepherd Prophetic thought of Unity, and Peace, That ever filled the blessed Saviour's mind! When men from cruel wars and strife should cease, And friendly intercourse the nations bind. One Shepherd, and one Flock there then shall be, By the good Shepherd guided, watched, and fed; Dwelling in peace, or wandering safe and free In pastures green, and by still waters led. Not to exalt one nation did he come, But all to gather in one sacred fold; To make of earth, as heaven, a peaceful home, By prophets long in prophecy foretold. Hasten ye Ages, till the world fulfil The word of Christ, and learn the Father's will. Poem No. 403; c. 17 January 1874 Old Houses of Salem Illustrated by George M. White These humble dwellings, old, and quaint, The artist bids us view, A history have; which often shames The modern, grand and new. For here the wealthy, and the poor, The high-born, and the low Contented dwelt; nor cared for gain, For grandeur, and for show. Honest and true, and pure, and kind, Their homes and hearths they loved; And to each other in their need They firm and faithful proved. The wilderness they here subdued, By manly toil, and pain; Or on the ocean bravely strove A livelihood to gain. They worshipped God in purity, In spirit, and in love; And sought on earth a church to be, Like to the church above. They sought a Commonwealth to found, A free and Christian State; Now, through their toil and suffering, Grown strong, and rich, and great. A lesson may their children learn, As here their homes they see; That not in wealth or outward good Is man's nobility. To keep, improve the heritage, Which they have handed down; By virtuous lives, and noble deeds, Our fathers' work to crown. Poem No. 635; c. 23 January 1874 Columbines and Anemones Prang's American chromos,ââWild Flowers, after water-color by Miss Ellen Robbins, have been much admired, and are well suited to the decoration of boudoirs.â Before the early flowers have faded quite, That breathed their fragrance over vale and lea; The Columbines, in scarlet vesture bright, Quickly succeed the pale Anemone; Crowning our rocky hills in gay attire, Or nodding on the steep and craggy rock; They bid us climb for that which we desire, Or, far beyond our reach, with beauty mock. In fancy groups of children there I see, Gathering large bunches for their distant home; And hear again their shouts, and merry glee, As through the fields, and o'er the hills they roam. Fair Flowers! my boyhood's love, and still so dear; Thanks to the Artist, who has made you bloom, When Winter's storms, and Winter's snows are here, To cheer us through its months of cold, and gloom. Poem No. 64; c. 14 February 1874 The Hepatica in Winter Underneath its snowy bed, The hepatica lies dead! All its beauteous colors fled! No, not dead, but sleeping; Spring Shall again its beauty bring, And its beauty poets sing. There, protected from the cold, Doth the plant its life still hold, Woolly leaves the germ infold. In the bud a flower survives, Hidden from man's searching eyes; 'Tis not Beauty's self that dies! Beauty still is born anew, We again its tints shall view, Rosy purple, deepest blue. Poem No. 751; c. 24 February 1874 Reverence We need more reverence in this froward age, That doth forget the teachings of the past; The wisdom of the old, the Sacred Page, Whose truth shall fleeting time itself outlast. Not by the light alone the present sheds, Nor by the sun's bright beams alone we see; Upon the path, in which man darkling treads, Fall glimmering rays from far antiquity. And all are needed, lest we go astray; In our own wisdom confident and bold; Careless to learn, too proud to ask the way, Doubting, perhaps, when often plainly told; Unwilling to confess the truth, whose light Shone in the darkness of the ancient night. Poem No. 762; c. 21 March 1874 Inward Phenomena More strange than wonders of the earth, or skies, The earthquake's shock, the fiery comet's train, On which men gaze with terror and surprise, Are those within; which scarce a thought may gain. There sudden passion oft doth shake the soul, Banishing reason from her kingly throne; Owning no more her just and wise control, Obedient to its own behests alone. And there the dark eclipse, that clouds the mind, When doubt at length doth over faith prevail; And, in the light of truth, men wander blind, Powerless to draw aside the murky veil! Why should these outward wonders draw man's eye, When in himself far mightier wonders lie? Poem No. 331; c. 18 April 1874 To the Memory of Alpheus Crosby A noble life, well spent in learning's cause, And public good, has passed from earth away! With saddened thoughts, in its swift round, we pause, A heart-felt tribute to its worth to pay. E'en from his youth, to studious lore inclined, By day, by night, he turned the classic page, And, by his studies cultured and refined, He gave new grace and culture to the age. Nor less he labored for the public good, In every noble work an earnest man; Boldly the power of Slavery, War, withstood, A true reformer, ever in the van. Our loss it is, not his, that we deplore, That we on earth shall see his face no more! Poem No. 15; c. April 1874 The Birds The birds are singing still their songs In vale, and leafy wood; As when the earth itself was made, And all was fair and good. They sing as if no death were here, No suffering, pain, disease; And sweet their notes at morning's hour Are borne upon the breeze. No want they know, like suffering man, Whom famine vexes sore; For God doth for their wants provide, From out his liberal store. Ye heralds of the early Spring! Would I your joy might share; And learn, though evil still abounds, That all is good and fair. That every thing, which God has made, E'en sinful, suffering man; Is part, though dimly now perceived, Of one all gracious plan. For faith a future doth reveal, To which all beings tend; A future on the earth, in heaven, And sin and suffering end. Poem No. 464; c. 19 May 1874 Superfluities How many things there are in common life That needful seem, because they always lie About us everywhere; we ask not why. We were born with them, and in vain our strife; For heavier grow the burdens we must bear, Till childhood even has a look of care. And, growing with our growth, the things of sense Like to an army gather daily round; Till scarce they have left a passage to us hence Big as a needle's eye, so close they have bound. Thus custom, luxury, do man's life control, Pamper the body, starve the immortal soul; Till we forget our high and heavenly birth, And deem ourselves at length but sons of earth. Continued And what's the remedy? All at once to break The thousand cords of this connected life, And by one step, a hermit, end the strife? Will selfish solitude man nobler make? Or shall we leave our home the world to rove, And to our social duties faithless prove? Nay, let not rashness, haste, the burden try; Nor pleasure-seeking mind, that loves to stray; These are the very things we should deny, For more than all our other evils they. Rather be patience, suffering long the road, On which we learn to bear life's 'customed load; Perhaps, while through its darkling paths we tread, A light shall beam, and prove its guiding thread. Poem No. 194; c. 23 May 1874 Arethusa Meadow Far off, among the distant hills, A lonely meadow lies; Where grows a flower of beauty rare, But hid from careless eyes. Though all around the woodwax spreads Its brilliant cloth of gold, More dazzling than was ever seen By knights and kings of old; And the azalea in the swamp, Its fragrance sheds around; Yet not for these my feet have sought This unfrequented ground. But for the Arethusa rare, That in the meadow grows; With petals blushing like the dawn, Or like the summer's rose. With down-cast look it bends its head, As shunning human gaze; Nor asking, like yon gorgeous flowers, For words of human praise. Like her, who gave to it its name, From man's pursuit it hides; And where his feet but seldom come Midst blue eyed grass abides. Sprinkling the low wet meadow o'er, With flowers of loveliest bloom; That shed upon the passing breeze Their delicate perfume. Poem No. 114; c. 3 July 1874 The Night Blooming Cereus Strange flower, to ope when day is o'er, Beneath the stars' faint light; Shunning the sun's bright, cheering rays, That other flowers delight. The lily now has closed its leaves, The pansy shut its eye; While thy fair petals open wide Beneath the evening sky. And strange, that such an ugly stem So fair a flower should bear; That thus the contrast too should make So fair a flower more fair. A miracle thou truly art, Waking when others sleep; In thee we see the law reversed, Which others faithful keep. I watch the eager wondering throng, As on thy form they look; Half conscious of the lesson taught In Nature's pictured book. On which, as we more deeply pore, New wonders still we find; To raise our thoughts and hearts in love To the All-perfect Mind. Poem No. 442; c. 24 July 1874 On The Wild Flowers of the Art Exhibition While Nature still delays her flowers to bring, And all the fields around are white with snow, With not a token of the coming Spring, On Art's fair page we see their beauties glow. The snowdrop with its slender stem is seen, The houstonia with its pale blue flower, Scattered by myriads o'er our pastures green, When Spring returns to deck her faded bower. And Summer's gorgeous colored flowers are here, Lobelia with its brilliant, dazzling hue, The lily red, and painted cup appear, With the fair rose; and each to Nature true. Art waits not for the tardy months of time; All seasons are her own, and every clime. Poem No. 812; c. 24 July 1874 Interpreting Nature The sights we see, the sounds we hear, Are fitted to the eye and ear; They're not a dumb, unmeaning show, But speak a language all men know. The flower, the rock, the bush, the tree, Have each some message unto me; They give direction to my way, And lead me on from day to day. The storm-tost wave, the moaning wind, Have meaning to the listening mind; Oft the forgetful soul is stirred By insect's hum, or song of bird. We need not rove o'er land and sea Ere we shall find this mystery; Close to ourselves the wonder lies, In things perhaps we little prize. We wander on as in a dream, O'er lofty hill, by wandering stream; Yet in the scene no beauty find, With heart untouched, or worldly mind. Daily the sights and sounds return, Till we the lesson taught shall learn That Nature everywhere doth teach, Though not in words of human speech. Poem No. 560; c. 25 July 1874 The Incarnation Time's greatest Mystery, the Word made man, That took our nature, suffered on the tree; Existing ere the world of sense began, That was before all time, O God, with Thee! To that mysterious moment would we soar, When by the Word the heavens and earth were made; And with a reverent, childlike faith adore The glorious power in all thy works displayed. But deeper reverence would our spirits feel For Him, who in our human nature came, The glory of the Father to reveal; A glory that outshines the sun's bright flame, Which shines into our hearts, where all was night, With splendors that make dim the morning's light. Poem No. 719; c. 8 August 1874 On a Lichen from North Cape Gathered by Mr. J. M. Richards, July 3d, 1874 Where no tree nor grass can grow, On a far northern hill, This humble lichen brought to me, Doth their place in Nature fill. Food for the reindeer fleet, And e'en for human kind, Do such as live in that region cold In thy tiny leaflets find. There all is strange and new; For there, there is no night; On thy native hill the midnight sun, Unquenched, shines warm and bright. Long, long is the Winter time, With no returning day; But instead the moon, or stars' faint light, And the red auroral ray. And the ocean, like the land, Doth its mystery retain; No ship has sailed to the farther shore, And returned o'er the trackless main. Yet still, o'er that pathless sea, Doth man's spirit restless go; Seeking to reach its farthest bounds, And its secrets all to know. And thou, from that far-off Cape, Hast come a new bond to be, 'Twixt this our land and the frozen North, With its mysterious sea. Poem No. 806; 3 Julyâ18 August 1874 For we Walk by Faith, not by Sight Not as beholding with our mortal sight The things unseen, not yet to sense revealed; Nor yet as those, who in the world delight, From whom the glorious gospel is concealed; We walk by faith; while many a vision sweet Doth cheer us on our path from day to day: And many a worldly show with grandeur cheat, And seek to draw us from the narrow way. The world doth walk by sight; its kingdom here, To outward view, is builded high, and strong; It knows not that the Lord is drawing near! To whom the world and all therein belong; Before whose face its towers shall melt away, As swift dissolving clouds in morning's ray. Poem No. 360; c. 22 August 1874 On the Neglect of Public Worship âThe interruption of public worship may consummate, in the period of a few years, the important work of a national revolution.ââ Gibbon. I. Worship declines; nor hidden is the cause; 'Tis found in pride, and in the greed for gold, That larger crowds the voice of pleasure draws Than does the Preacher gather in Christ's fold. In pleasure's cup would men their sorrows drown. âCome, let us eat and drink, for soon we die,â We hear them say; âour heads with roses crown, Enjoy the present moments as they fly.â 'Twas thus, as history tells, the nations spake That in their pride have long since passed away; May we in time its solemn warning take That pride and luxury go before decay; Where these prevail pure worship soon must end, And noblest nations swift to ruin tend. Worship we need, true worship, not the name; Within the temples, 'neath the open sky; Together, or alone, it is the same, To the lone wanderer his God is nigh. He heareth not our words, though 'neath the domes Of costly temples we our voices raise; Or worship Him apart within our homes, If we are not his own; and love his praise. Amid the scenes of Nature we may rove, Nor see his Power, nor own his guiding Hand; All Nature teaches of a Father's love, But oft we fail to know and understand. Lord, grant thy Spirit, hear our earnest prayer, That we may praise and worship everywhere. Poem No. 851; c. 5 September 1874 The Solitary Gentian I searched the meadow far around, Where once the Gentian grew; And but a single flower I found, With its dark, purple hue. Nor summer suns, nor latter rain Can now their life restore; Beside the brook I search in vain, There they are seen no more! Man gathered, with unsparing hand, Their beauty, and their bloom; Nor dreamed he robbed the generous land, And sealed the fair flower's doom. Nor seed, nor even roots, were left, New flowers again to yield; Of all its beauty was bereft The lovely meadow field. A single, solitary flower Yet lingered in the place; The last to deck bright Autumn's bower, The last of all its race! The meadow mourns its darlings' fate, And I, in plaintive song, Would still to years of distant date Their memory prolong. Poem No. 265; c. 13 October 1874 Indian Remains With ocean shell clasped to his breast, The chief doth on the hillside rest; As if he still could hear the roar Of waves upon the rocky shore. Or sign it was of high estate, And buried only with the great; His royal power and rule to show, That all in death a king might know. His bear skin robe is changed to dust, Its ornaments consumed by rust; And from the tiny, tinkling bell, No sound is heard his name to tell. Oft have the redmen's bones been found On sloping hill, or field around; No more the forest shade they rove, Or feast beside yon sheltered cove! We ponder on their strange, sad fate; Whence was their origin? and date? From rising, or from setting sun, Was their long pilgrimage begun? No record tells;âbut as the shell Doth of the distant ocean tell, Far inland from its native beach, These relics meaning have, and speech. They show that sympathy can bind In one all tribes of human kind; That e'en their forms one image bear, Their Maker's image, noble, fair. Though through long ages soiled, debased, In all one lineage may be traced; As when from the Creative Hand Man stood, the lord of sea and land. And raised again, by Power Divine, Their forms shall with new glory shine; One destiny with them we share, As they with us God's image bear. Poem No. 839; c. 1 December 1874 English Sparrows Here, where our fathers homeless came, Nor rudest shelter found, The English sparrows find a home, And chirp and flit around. They felt the blasts of wintry winds, Ere they their cots could rear: And deep the snows around them fell O'er hills, and forest drear. And oft in hunger here they pined, And sickness wasting sore; And yet with faith and courage strong, They every trial bore. But thoughtful minds and feeling hearts Do for your wants provide; And shelter from the winter's storms, Where you may safe abide. The sparrow-house we grateful place, Where it can build its nest; And, through the winter's cold, and storms, Find shelter, food, and rest. In token of that Providence, That here our fathers led; And gave them here a quiet home, And with its bounty fed. Poem No. 172; c. 25 December 1874 The Home Love builds for us a bower, As bird its nest; E'en from life's earliest hour A home, a rest. There order dwells, and joys That never cease; Calm that no storm destroys, And lasting peace. It may be poor and spare, A clay-built cot; Or palace wondrous fair; We heed it not. For there each helping hand, And loving heart, And thoughtful mind that planned, Have borne their part. Father and mother dear, And brothers kind, And sisters' love are here, Our souls to bind. Shelter in youth and age, To man 'tis given To be his heritage On earth, in heaven. Poem No. 323; c. 2 January 1875 Behold, I Make All Things New There's nothing new the Preacher cries, With saddened heart, and weary mind; That which hath been is that which is, And nothing new on earth we find. Night follows day, and day the night, As the earth circles round the sun; The rivers from the ocean rise, And back into the ocean run. Man cannot rise above himself, And reason's calm behests obey; Though for a time he heed her laws, Soon will he yield to passion's sway. The order of our daily life May wild confusion yet succeed; We see not yet those happy years, Of which in prophecy we read. For in a circle all things move, They different seem, yet are the same; That which the future now we call, Is still the present but in name. Not so the Spirit teaching saith, New heavens and earth shall we behold; A brighter, fairer, happier scene Shall, even here, succeed the old. The same, yet changed, improved, adorned By skill of man, and Power Divine; Coworking here to our great end, Far-seeing, healthful, and benign. No more disease, nor pain, nor death Shall in that blessed world be known; Nor sin can enter, and defile, And make that paradise its own. The former things have passed away, Like the dark shadows of the night; And God himself shall dwell with men, And be their Everlasting Light. Within, the spirit, quickened, sees New power and love in all around; And heavenly music greets the ear In every voice, and every sound. Behold, He maketh all things new, It hears from angel harps above; Come quickly Lord! on earth fulfil Thy prophecy of joy and love. Poem No. 634; c. 16 January 1875 Oliver C. Felton, Esq., of Brookfield Far from his early charge, at four score years, The aged Teacher passed from earth away; With saddened heart each distant pupil hears, Who knew so well his worth in life's young day. Faithful, and earnest; to his calling true, With knowledge he the gift of teaching brought; For not the lore of books alone he knew, But by his life, and friendly guidance taught. With honor passed his peaceful, happy age, Serving, in after years, his town, and state; In rural labors loved he to engage, Till gathered, like a shock of corn, full late! Long will his pupils cherish here his fame, In love and honor hold their teacher's name. Poem No. 113; c. 29 January 1875 On the Increase of Crime since the Late Civil War War brings increase of crime; itself a sin, Unnumbered evils follow in its train; With war at first did Slavery begin, And, in the end, by war was Slavery slain. For though a nation struggle to be free, And conquer in the fratricidal strife, Still unto sin in bondage it may be, Nor gain a nobler, purer, higher life. Intemperance, lust, and greed of gold may still Follow war's triumph with their deadly blight; More fatal far than arms the body kill, Threatening our future with disastrous night; Till ignorance, vice and crime fill all the land, That else might Freedom's bulwark ever stand! Poem No. 758; c. 20 February 1875 The Meteorologists Ye watch the appearance of the earth and sky, And oft with certainty predict a change; Fair weather now, and now a storm is nigh, As o'er our mighty continent they range. And this is well; to study Nature's laws, And all her hidden mysteries make known; But if in these the immortal mind shall pause, Content to know phaenomena alone; If, with no grateful heart, no reverent mind, The sunshine and the rain we shall receive; To higher truths, to nobler knowledge blind, In Nature and her laws alone believe; What profits it? Wiser were men of old, Who could each change with wonder, faith behold. Poem No. 855; c. 6 March 1875 The Origin of Man I. Man has forgot his Origin; in vain He searches for the record of his race In ancient books, or seeks with toil to gain From the deep cave, or rocks some primal trace. And some have fancied, from a higher sphere, Forgetful of his origin he came; To dwell awhile a wandering exile here Subject to sense, another, yet the same. With mind bewildered, weak how should he know The Source Divine from whom his being springs? The darkened spirit does its shadow throw On written record, and on outward things; That else might plainly to his thought reveal The wondrous truths, which now they but conceal. II. Not suffering for their sins in former state, As some have taught, their system to explain; Nor hither sent, as by the sport of fate, Souls that nor memory, nor love retain, Do men into this world of nature come; But born of God; though earthy, frail and weak; Not all unconscious of a heavenly home, Which they through trial, suffering, here must seek. A heavenly Guide has come the way to show, To lead us to the Father's house above; From Him he came, to Him, he said, I go; Oh may we heed the message of his love! That we no more in darkness, doubt, may roam, But find while here we dwell our heavenly home. Poem No. 324; c. 20 March 1875 Sailing on Cakes of Ice in the North River The thick ice breaks, it floats away, It sails towards the sea; No longer on the shore 'twill stay, Spring's breath has set it free. For three long months, beneath, the tide Has daily ebbed and flowed; While fixed its frozen surface wide Nor life nor motion showed. Now all is changed! the river's face Reflects the azure sky; In fleets the cakes each other chase To ocean hurrying by. Methinks I see on many a cake My schoolmates boldly sail; Swiftly, or slow, their course they take, As winds or calms prevail. With various fates they onward steer, Some stranded, broken, lost; Some down the stream are sailing clear, Some in mid current tost. The merry laugh, the shout, the name, Still echo from the shore; All for a moment seems the same, As long, long years before. The scene my fancy doth recall, With pleasing, fresh delight; A picture hung in memory's hall, Forever fair and bright. Poem No. 583; c. 8 April 1875 Original Hymn Not unto men alone has come The Saviour's earnest call, âGo, feed my sheep, that homeless roam;â It comes alike to all. It finds response in childhood's heart, That, moved with others' need, Would gladly do its humble part Christ's suffering lambs to feed. In many a city's streets they rove, With none to shelter, bless, With none to guide, instruct, and love, As in a wilderness. âLov'st thou me?â the Saviour said To him who had denied; âThen feed my sheep, the feeblest aid; To thee I them confide.â That blessed mission may we all Like Peter, too, fulfil; So shall we heed the Saviour's call, And do our Father's will. Poem No. 369; c. 16 May 1875 The Faith of the First Christians Blessed were they, who in the early time, In Jesus saw the Christ, the Son of God; Followed his footsteps with a faith sublime, And the same path of duty, suffering trod. They saw what prophets, kings desired to see, And heard what they had longed to hear in vain; The parable's deep truth, the mystery, Hid from the multitude, to them was plain. In him they saw the world redeemed, forgiven, Suffering no more the blight and curse of sin; And, still beyond, the encircling walls of heaven, Whose radiant light bids all to enter in. Would that like faith were ours, that we might be Thus born of God, and thus his kingdom see! Poem No. 71; c. 16 June 1875 On the Great Earthquake in New Grenada For when Thy Judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn Righteousness Isa. 26:9. Thy sudden terrors strike the world with dread, Whole cities by the earthquake's shock laid low! The maimed, and suffering buried with the dead, The living stunned, bewildered by the blow! Fair was the day, and joyously the throng Filled all the streets, on gain, or pleasure bent; The city full of revelry and song; When by the shock the solid earth was rent! So dost Thou teach the nations, Lord of heaven And earth, to own Thy righteous sway; Not unto them alone the lesson given, But that all men might Thy commands obey. Nor dost Thou teach them only by Thy Word, But earth, too, trembles at Thy voice, O Lord! Poem No. 717; c. 29 June 1875 The Woodwax in Bloom We roam afar, o'er sea and land, The grand and beautiful to see; But things that near us lie, at hand, See not; though grand and fair they be. We have no sense to feel their power; The ocean's grandeur and its might, The beauty of the sunset hour, How oft they fail to give delight! Spread with a lavish wealth around, The golden woodwax, see in bloom! O'er hills and pastures wide 'tis found, In rocky clefts its roots find room. The rugged rocks a beauty wear, That else we never should behold; The barren hills grow wondrous fair, Each covered with its cloth of gold! A scene surpassing all that kings, With all their riches, can display; A glory every summer brings, Effulgent pomp of summer's day! Yet vainly is that glory shown To careless eyes, and grovelling mind; That dull to Nature's charms have grown, And to her beauty, grandeur, blind. Why do we roam, with discontent, Afar; when Nature meets us here? Such glory to our hills has lent, Such grandeur in the ocean near? Poem No. 763; c. 20 July 1875 On Visiting the Graves of Hawthorne and Thoreau Beneath these shades, beside yon winding stream, Lies Hawthorne's manly form, the mortal part! The soul, that loved to meditate and dream, Might linger here unwilling to depart, But that a higher life has called away To fairer scenes, to nobler work and thought. Why should the spirit then on earth delay, That has a glimpse of such bright regions caught And near another, Nature's child, doth rest? Thoreau, who loved each woodland path to tread; So gently sleeping on his mother's breast! Living, though numbered with the numerous dead. We mourn! But hope will whisper in the heart, We meet again! and meet no more to part. Poem No. 68; c. 6 August 1875 On Viewing the Falls of Niagara, as Photographed by George Barker Amidst those scenes of wonder do I stand, Though not in bodily presence, but in thought; Stupendous works of the Almighty's hand! By artist's skill before my vision brought. The deep, strong floods, that downward ever pour, The mists, that from their bosom ever rise, I see; and almost seem to hear the roar Of many waters, sounding to the skies. The littleness of man, the power of God, Doth to the sight as visible appear! So felt the Indian, as these scenes he trod; 'Twas the Great Spirit's voice he seemed to hear, That the deep silence of the forests broke, And to his children in its thunders spoke. Poem No. 45; c. 3 September 1875 Knowledge and Truth Knowledge is not like truth, of heavenly birth, It partial is, and may be done away; Too often proud, and selfish, born of earth, Its light grows dim before truth's purer ray. One we acquire with eager, thirsting mind, Curious to search, and prove possess and hold; The other is a gift; who seek shall find; Truth's ever young, but knowledge groweth old. Increase of knowledge oft doth sorrow bring, For it can never fill the human soul; That longs to drink of a diviner spring, To know the truth; man's rest, and highest goal. While here we knowledge seek with restless mind, May we not fail the heaven-born truth to find. Poem No. 312; c. 9 October 1875 Mt. Shasta. A Painting, by H. O. Young. How, like a spiritual Presence, dost thou rise, O lonely mountain, spotless, pure, and white! While far beneath, in shade, the prairie lies, Thy snowy peak reflects the morning light! Thy base is hidden from our searching gaze, As if no earthly mountain thou might'st be; But a creation of the sun's bright rays, A spiritual mount, a mystery. So have I seen a cloud, in summer's day, Piercing with its white peak the azure sky; Calling men's thoughts from earth and sense away, Teaching man's spirit, through the outward eye, To hold communion with the Mind, that made Nature's forms, alike in all displayed. Poem No. 190; c. 19 November 1875 Song I Love the Light I love the light, when first its beams Steal o'er the earth and sky; And gently wake the slumbering world, And bid the shadows fly. I love the light of noon-day sun, Its full, effulgent ray; That floods the earth, and sea, and sky, And brings the perfect day. I love the light of sunset hour, Which lingers in the west; Which soothes the weary heart and mind, And gives the laborer rest. I love the moon's soft, silvery light, The light of stars, that keep Their watches o'er a weary world, When wrapt in slumbers deep. Poem No. 245; c. 27 November 1875 Nature Teaches Us of Time and its Duration To show us time, its passing and its change, Was Nature made; in which we all do live; And all its mighty panorama strange Doth the same lesson to earth's children give. The seasons come and go, the flower, the leaf, Teach us how quickly it has taken flight; And setting suns, with golden splendors brief, Warn us how soon to day succeeds the night. And the bright stars that glitter in the sky, And seem to mock our lives' short, busy round, And, in their orbits, time itself defy, Have yet, like man, their date, and certain bound. What Nature teaches heed; no lesson miss; And fleeting years shall bring eternal bliss. Poem No. 740; c. 18 December 1875 Take ye heed, watch and pray: for ye know not when the time is. Mark 13:33. Come suddenly, O Lord, or slowly come, I wait thy will, thy servant ready is; Thou hast prepared thy follower a home; The heaven in which thou dwellest too is his. Come in the morn, at noon, or midnight deep, Come, for thy servant still doth watch and pray; E'en when the world around is sunk in sleep, I wake, and long to see thy glorious day. I would not fix the time, the day, nor hour, When Thou with all thine angels shall appear; When in thy kingdom Thou shalt come with power, E'en now, perhaps, the promised day is near! For though, in slumber deep, the world may lie, And e'en thy Church forget thy great command; Still year by year thy Coming draweth nigh, And in its power thy kingdom is at hand. Not in some future world alone 'twill be, Beyond the grave, beyond the bounds of time; But on the earth thy glory we shall see, And share thy triumph, peaceful, pure, sublime. Lord! help me that I faint not, weary grow, Nor at thy Coming slumber too, and sleep; For Thou hast promised, and full well I know Thou wilt to us thy word of promise keep. Poem No. 92; 1875 The Ancient Burial Places in Peabody It was the custom in Danvers, now Peabody, for many families to bury their dead on their own farms; a custom not wholly discontinued. There are many such ancient burial places in this town. They lie by the roadside, where they lived, In the fields they loved to till; And the landscape round a fitness lends, Which the musing mind doth fill With a peace and rest, in sweet accord With the lives, which here they led; As with honest toil, and frugal ways, They toiled for their daily bread. In sight of the homes to them so dear, Of the woods, and hills they lie; And the plaintive brook, with its soft, low voice, Is heard as it glideth by. With simple rites, by their neighbors' hands They were laid in the kindly earth; With heavenly words for the sorrowing heart, That told of a higher birth. Though no costly tomb, nor e'en a stone, May tell where their bodies rest; Yet not less sacred the cherished spots, Which are by their memory blest. In the faith of their fathers they lived and died; That the spirit survives the dust, That the righteous shall wear a heavenly crown, And receive the reward of the just. Poem No. 643; c. 4 January 1876 Man's Need of a Spiritual Birth How sayest thou we must be born again, The Jewish teacher to Messias said; Hast thou a message to the sons of men, So different from what we have taught, and read? Yet is it true; another birth we need, Ere we the kingdom of our God shall see; The heavenly plant is born of heavenly seed, Its birth and growth to man a mystery. The Spirit send, O Lord, and thus renew Our feeble powers, make pure our hearts within, As falls the quickening rain, or silent dew, That we the heavenly life may here begin; And, while we tread the sorrowing, sinful earth, Be born of God, and know a higher birth. Poem No. 200; c. 5 February 1876 On some Eternals from a friend's garden Gone are the flowers, which bloomed so sweet and fair, Where late I walked in Summer with delight; Of all their beauties, Winter none would spare Save these Eternals, that still charm the sight. When fair Petunias lose their varied bloom, And Pansies rich are buried 'neath the snow; With fadeless colors these adorn our room, And oft recall thy garden's beauteous show. Thus do they love, and friendship symbolize, As well as Summer's fair and fragrant flowers; Amid the winter's gloom, and stormy skies, To fancy picture still her blooming bowers; And in their fadeless colors we may find Emblems of feelings lasting as the mind. Poem No. 152; c. 11 February 1876 Hymn The Rest of the Righteous Sweet is the rest the righteous gain! They to a higher life Have come, through weariness and pain, Through earthly toil and strife. They rest in peace! no foes can harm, Nor persecution kill; No terrors strike them with alarm; No power can work them ill. No inward conflicts now they wage, Their strife with self is o'er; No doubts disturb, and passion's rage Shall shake their souls no more. They gaze, as from some hill serene, Upon the world below; Calmly they view the troubled scene, And all its trials know. Another, higher life is theirs; Thus from their toils they rest; For each the heavenly life now shares, And in its work is blest. Their works bear witness to their faith, And have a sure reward; They follow them, the Spirit saith, Their Judge, the risen Lord. Poem No. 450; c. 4 March 1876 âTuesday night, the schooner Weaver, of Glen Creek, N.J., went to pieces near Sandy Hook, and her entire crew were lost.ââTranscript, March 22d. âFor God's sake, help!â the drowning seaman cries, But vain man's help! the shoremen cannot save! The driving snow clouds blind their gazing eyes, Vessel and crew are whelmed beneath the wave! But trust in God still filled his fainting soul, Whose power he witnessed on the raging deep; May the same trust the mourners' hearts control, And comfort those, who for their loved ones weep. Have faith in God. Man's help, at times, is vain, To reach the sufferers on life's dangerous coast; His power alone can then their souls sustain; In mortal aid, or skill how vain our boast! But they who trust in Him, shall find him near, To calm their minds, and banish every fear. Poem No. 130; 22â31 March 1876 The Purification of the Temple Lord! cleanse thine inner temple, as of old Thou didst thy holy place of traffic vile; Of those who in its precincts bought and sold; With sheep and oxen did thy courts defile. Purge Thou the inner temple of the mind, The heart itself of man, O Lord, make pure, That he may Thee and thy true worship find, Which through eternal ages shall endure. Then will the offerings accepted be Which he unto thy holy mount shall bear; Fulfilled the word the prophet spake of Thee, âMy temple shall be called the House of Prayerâ; For every nation then shall hear thy Word, And all the people know and serve the Lord. Poem No. 321; c. 22 April 1876 The May Flower I found upon our neighboring hills A flower, there growing thick as dropping rain; And from its friends removed it far, And in strange company did it detain. And far I took it from the old grey rocks, And from the dark green wood wax spreading round, From barberry bush with its prickly stems, And placed it in the distant garden's ground. Then I thought that it would quickly die, When removed so far from the rocky hills; Where the sun shines bright the live-long day, And the bird's sweet song every covert fills. For not lightly sundered frailest thread, Which binds to its haunt the sweet May flower; Mid the garden's bloom it droops and fades, And pineth still in the fairest bower. The floweret lived; but an exile seemed That pined for his country far away; In summer it seeded, in autumn Grew sere; and it bloomed, once again, in May. And I marked, as its little white flowers Appeared, that still to its friends it was true; Though afar from the spot of its birth, They came forth as when by their side it grew. So we, though we roam to far distant lands, Through the grandest and fairest of earth; Can never forget mountain, river, and vale, Trees, and flowers in the place of our birth. For something there is in every place, Where kind Providence places his lot; Binds man to his home, like the humblest flower, Which heralds the Spring in his natal spot. Poem No. 229; c. 2 May 1876 The International Exhibition at Philadelphia A joyful spirit to the world The welcome poet brings, And from the music in his heart He to the people sings. No more of war his numbers tell, But of abiding peace; When the whole world shall be renewed, And nations' strife shall cease. Their passions that ungoverned were Shall yield to reason's sway; Kings' hearts be, like the rivers, turned; The law of love obey. In friendly intercourse they meet, From every land and clime; In peaceful arts alone to vie, A brotherhood sublime. From Europe, Asia, Africa, And islands of the sea, They meet upon Columbia's soil, The land of liberty. Whate'er is useful, grand or fair, The gifts of prince or king, The people's workmanship and art, They o'er the ocean bring. And to the city famed for peace And love to man of old, They come, this great Centennial year, Their festival to hold. Poem No. 10; c. 6 May 1876 Evolution I. Because the gradual growth of things we see, And naught at once mature and perfect made; From tiny seed the lofty branching tree, Yielding at length its fruit and thick-leaved shade; Or, from the egg, we see the bird, or beast, By gradual growth to perfect stature grow; Tracing all forms the mightiest from the least; We think the origin of things we know. In the same order we ourselves do live, Nor aught immediate see, nor understand; But to phenomena a meaning give, As if man's narrow thought had Nature planned; Nor rise with reverent mind and faith sublime, Above the encircling bounds of space and time. II. Man's thoughts turn on himself; and whence is Man? He asks. What countless forms, and changes vast, Since first his life upon the earth began! In vain do we interrogate the past; The torch of knowledge doth but dimly show His path from land to land, from clime to clime; And who, by natural descent, can know His origin, or era date in time? Yet is he one, where'er his feet have trod; Though changed in mind, as well as outward frame, Created in the image of his God, Though lost by some the knowledge of his Name; Our brother still, and destined too, as we, To show the ages of eternity. Poem No. 63; c. 3 April 1875 (ll. 1â14); c. 12 May 1876 (ll. 15â28) Capt. Samuel Cook Well I remember him long years ago, As on our vessel's deck I saw him stand; When yet, the Crescent City far below, He came to take my Capt. Jones Very of the barque Aurelia, of Boston. Seeing signal, Capt. Cook of the ship Delphos, came down the river in his boat to meet us, before we arrived at the city. father by the hand. And with him Noble, Felt, and Hooper there, Brave captains then, like him, and in their prime, Yet none more ruddy, and erect, and fair; Remembered well through fifty years of time. But all are gone! himself the last to leave This changing scene for higher, nobler life! Why for the aged seaman should we grieve, Who bore so well life's storms, and ocean's strife? Safe in the harbor of an endless rest, With those he mourned and loved on earth the best. Poem No. 769; c. 30 May 1876 On the Beautiful Roses, In front of the Mansion of John Hodges, Esq. Fair damask roses! that, from year to year, Blush in your beauty on the busy street; Thanks to the unknown hand that placed you here, And made the spot with bloom and fragrance sweet. The sun's hot rays upon the pavement beat, Where not a blade of grass, or flower, can grow; But you, within your pleasant, green retreat. More pleasure give than garden's beauteous show. How many from the sight have borne away Some glad remembrance of your gorgeous bloom, How many, in the sultry summer's day, Borne on the air, have caught your sweet perfume! Through coming years may still your beauties last, And fragrant make the future as the past. Poem No. 106; c. 23 June 1876 The Cows waiting at the Pasture Gate The herd is standing on the hill, Or lying on the ground; Their number now is all complete, The last stray wanderer found. They wait the opening of the gate, How peaceful their repose! It soothes the mind, and o'er the scene A quiet beauty throws. O'er the wide pastures they have roamed Through all the summer day, Grazing at will o'er hill and vale, Where'er they chanced to stray. At some cool spring they quench their thirst, Whose source is never dry; The water trickling from the rock Yields still a full supply. O'er rocky hills their pathway winds, Through swamps and meadows green; Till resting 'neath the distant pines, The herd at noon is seen. When in the west the sun declines, The cowherd's voice they hear, And homeward turn; his barking dog Still hanging on their rear. And, winding slowly o'er the hills, The deep worn path is trod; Till on the last they waiting stand, Or rest upon the sod. The keeper opens wide the gate, For now the hour is come; And lowing down the busy street The cows are driven home. Poem No. 509; c. 4 August 1876 Song The Summer Day The day has gone, the summer day, Fled on its golden wings away; Why will it not yet longer stay? 'Tis gone to make still others blest, Gone to its goal in the far west, Leaving us here to quiet rest. If we its hours have well employed, The gifts it brought improved, enjoyed, Our pleasure will be unalloyed. No vain regrets will fill the mind, The day has left us here behind; But we from toil sweet rest shall find. Poem No. 485; 5 August 1876 On some blue and golden Columbines from Pike's Peak, Colorado O new-born State, what lovely flowers are thine! Differing in color, but, in form, the same, From mountain heights has come thy Columbine, Which shares with ours in beauty and in name. Our youngest State may grander scenes disclose, Far loftier mountains, parks and vales more fair; Yet where the Columbine on hillside grows, Strange tho' the scene, one heritage we share. The lonely emigrant beholds the flower, Which in his boyhood's haunts far off he knew; And, at the sight, imagination's power Brings absent friends, and early home to view; And he forgets, in thoughts and visions dear, The mountain heights, which rise so grand and near. Poem No. 377; c. 1 September 1876 The Stony Desert of Life In far Australia's middle region lies A stony desert, treeless, hot and bare; All hope to pass it in the traveler dies; No brook, nor stream, nor native well is there. So do we in our lives some desert meet Which seems impassable, so wild and drear, Untrodden yet, perchance, by human feet; Where naught is found the sinking heart to cheer. Yet He who to such pass our steps may bring, When human help shall fail, will grant his own; E'en in the wild will show some cooling spring, Nor leave us there to perish, weak, alone; But guide our steps, if we but trust His care, Beyond its bounds to pastures green and fair. Poem No. 299; c. 2 September 1876 Cadmus The ancient Greeks a fable had, that he Who brought them letters sowed a dragon's teeth, And armed men sprung up; some wisdom we Perhaps may find the fable's form beneath. No gift so great but may be turned to ill; Thus e'en with letters may be born fierce strife, And armed men spring up to fight and kill, And that bring death which should have brought us life. The Press may grow corrupt, deceitful words, The seeds of war, scatter in every land; Till men shall beat their ploughshares into swords, And armed men spring up on every hand! Ah, when will God's great gift of human speech Naught but his love to all his children teach? Poem No. 459; c. 16 September 1876 The True Worshipers No outward service doth the Lord require, So much as inward service of the mind; The carnal mind doth carnal things desire, In forms and ritual doth religion find. The Temple service could not save, of old, Though none so grand, imposing, in man's sight; While the plain worship of the Christian fold Accepted was, and did the Lord delight. The Spirit doth a temple, forms, prepare, The lowliest worship it doth choose and bless; How blest are they who in its service share, In spirit and in truth the Lord confess! They in their worship shall accepted be, And, born of God, e'en now his kingdom see. Poem No. 357; c. 7 October 1876 Song We Have No Ship at Sea When thoughtlessly two lamps were burned, 'Twas in our poverty, âWe need but one,â we oft were told, âWe have no ship at sea.â âFor oil is dear, it will not do To use it thus so free; Two lamps we cannot now afford, We have no ship at sea.â How oft this proverb comes to mind, As, looking round, I see The idle, wasteful, ignorant, Who have no ships at sea. They will not work, they will not save, That prosperous they may be; That, when to manhood they have come, They may have ships at sea. In youth they will not knowledge seek, Of wealth and power the key; They learn no trades to live at home, Nor how to sail the sea. 'Tis knowledge, thrift, and honest toil, That brings prosperity; These make men prosper on the land, And have their ships at sea. Poem No. 796; c. 10 October 1876 The Gospel the Reconciling Power The word the Gospel brought was love and peace, A reconciling word to sinful men; That they from enmity and strife should cease, And as one family should dwell again. But, still estranged, behold the nations stand! While over Europe hangs the cloud of war, Which but of late made desolate our land, But now, in mercy driven from us afar. But still do enmity and hate remain. One nation still we are, but not one race; From human limbs have fallen Slavery's chain; When from the mind shall vanish, too, its trace, And in our hearts the Gospel's power be known, And self, and sin, and hate be overthrown? Poem No. 601; c. 4 November 1876 Every Day a Day of Freedom A day of Freedom is each dawning day, And day of Grace to sinful erring men; While shines its sun they all may find their way Back to the path of virtue truth again. Its beauty all may love, its light all see, Its noon-day glory fills the heaven and earth; From night's dark bondage it the soul would free, And make it heir of an immortal birth. In it the Psalmist saw God's law made clear, The law of freedom, purity, and right; But Christ taught unto God all men were dear, And called to be the children of the light; In its warm beams, and rains that plenteous fall, He saw a Father's love, that cares for all. Poem No. 6; c. 25 November 1876 Hymn Reflections at the Close of the Year The flowers of Spring have faded fast, The Summer's glories did not last, Autumn is gone, and Winter near; End of the varied, changeful year. Deep in thy mind consider well The lessons, which these changes tell, Of birth, growth, ripeness, and decay, How short man's life, how brief his stay. 'Tis His appointment here below, Who doth our state, and nature know; That we may thus submissive be To His all-wise, and just decree. Still may we own a Father's care In every suffering, grief, we bear; And through His works and Word, discern His righteous will, His wisdom learn. Oh, that some fruit we here may bear, That shall our souls for heaven prepare; Where days, and years, and seasons round, And change, and death, no more are found. Poem No. 500; c. 19 December 1876 On Hearing the Clock Strike, in Harmony Grove Why heard, amidst these shades, the tongue of time, Telling the number of the passing hours? For other thoughts, and feelings more sublime, Than those of earth, amidst these scenes are ours. What thoughts are theirs of time, whose mortal part Alone is subject to its stern controul; Who in this life can have no more a part, Living the life of the immortal soul? Say, do they mourn their days, and years misspent, Neglected opportunities recall; Or joy, that they improved the talents lent, Nor lived as though this earthly life were all? Ah, who can tell what are their thoughts, but he, Who with them shares their own eternity? Poem No. 821; c. 29 December 1876 The Indians' Belief in a Future State Beyond the river, they believe A happy country still is found, When their wild, roving life is o'er, Where forests, streams and game abound. Beyond the caÃ±ons' gloomy sides, Where scarce can pierce the light of day, A happy hunting-ground there is, Though men know not the trackless way. Beyond the mountains' distant heights There is a fairer earth and sky, Where, unmolested, they shall dwell As warriors, hunters, when they die. Beyond the ocean, where the sun Sinks in his journey to the west, They say their weary, wandering tribes Shall find at length a home, a rest. Thus dream they of the spirit-land, Nor higher rest they hope to find; They know no country of the soul, No home for the immortal mind. Beyond, and still beyond we gaze, For the green earth is not our home; A heavenly country, too, we seek, Where we, like them, no more shall roam. Poem No. 69; c. 27 January 1877 The Telephone The marvel of our age, the Telephone! What is the Telephone, do you inquire? The marvel of our time, before unknown, The human voice speaks through the electric wire! The distant city hears the spoken word, In waves of sound, transmitted o'er the line; The notes of music in sweet strains are heard; From Boston comes the song of âAuld Lang Syne.â These triumphs o'er the world of space and time The Telegraph and Telephone can show; And Science now, with joy and faith sublime, Doth a new gift upon the race bestow. Beneath the ocean soon man's voice may reach, And a new power be given to human speech. Poem No. 524; c. 23 February 1877 Love Needing a Visible Object How love whom we see not, and cannot see With mortal sight, the Invisible, Unknown? To highest angel still a mystery, Who nearest stands before his awful throne. Yet by the worlds we see is God revealed, On earth below and in the starry sky; The Invisible Spirit, else from man concealed, Reveals his goodness, power, to every eye. And by his son, who did his image bear, The image of his mercy and his grace, He doth his love, a Father's love declare, That we, though sinful, yet might see his face. Yea, our own hearts do tell us of his love, And, though invisible, his presence prove. Poem No. 191; c. 10 March 1877 The Perfect Love that Casts out Fear There is a state that all may know, No fear, no shame we feel; For God doth all his mercy show, And all his love reveal. His goodness manifested is, And all his ways are clear; The Spirit seals our souls as his, For we to him are dear. A Father's love, in our past years, By us is clearly known; For he has wiped away our tears, And as his sons doth own. And he has called us by his Son To know a higher life, With them forever to be one, No more with sin at strife. The darkness of the world has fled, That dimmed our mortal sight; We dwell no more in bondage, fear, But walk in heavenly light. Poem No. 615; c. 31 March 1877 The Glacial Marks on our Hills Here on our rocks the marks we see, Where once the glaciers moved on; Man shares in Nature's mystery, And lives in ages past and gone. In these smooth lines we trace their course From north to south across the land, A steady, but resistless force, That e'en the hills could not withstand. Up their rough slopes they onward go, To where the hills abruptly end; Then at their feet the fragments throw, And onward to the ocean tend. The boulders, which we see around, Like pebbles on their surface borne, Were in far distant regions found, From craggy hills, and mountains torn. The long moraine, which, like a road, Stretches through forests, fields afar; Tells where dissolved the icy flood, With warmer suns and skies at war. Imagination backward flies, And views with wonder, and with fear, The prospect which around her lies, Where naught is seen the mind to cheer! Yet in that scene man's thought can live, Though wild, and desolate, and bare; Can to these marks a meaning give, And the long life of Nature share. The present, like a fleeting dream, Does from his musing spirit fade! He gazes down Time's darkling stream, When mountains and the hills were made! Poem No. 171; c. 10 April 1877 The Future State of the Wicked and its Duration Seek not with mortal sight to pierce the gloom Which shrouds the wicked in a future state; Foretell the nature of their righteous doom, Nor seek to know how long or short its date. In the few years which thou on earth dost spend, Use well the time which God to thee has given; Known unto him alone can be the end, Make of thy home on earth a present heaven. Trust in a father's love; no gloomy fear Nor chilling doubts can then disturb thy mind; But thou shalt find his presence with thee near; Unto his will in patient hope resigned, That what Time's shadows from our eyes conceal, The eternal ages clearly will reveal. Poem No. 415; c. 14 April 1877 Faith in the Resurrection Confirmed That friends we loved, in dying did not die, We do believe; but oft our faith is weak, For error, doubt and fear our minds will try, And for our faith we confirmation seek. Imagination promises its aid, And pictures them to us as still alive; And brighter scenes than earth by it are made, By which our souls do strength and hope derive. But most the Word of God new hope doth bring, And with its light our spirits' depths illume; For Christ is risen! Death's conqueror and king! And banished from the earth its night of gloom, Which with its terrors did the soul assail, And even o'er our faith at times prevail. Poem No. 457; c. 5 May 1877 Spring and Summer Flowers The mingling scent of flowers is in the air, Gathered from piny wood and rocky dell; Of roses, callas, that the fostering care Of man through winter's stormy months can tell. The seasons' differing hues together meet; The gorgeous colors of the summer's flowers The delicate tints of early spring-time greet, That tell of wild wood haunts, and budding bowers. Scarce can the mind such contrasts fair retain, From each to each it turns with new delight; The blushing roses now the thoughts detain, And now the May flowers' beauties charm the sight; Now, the glad Present bids us here to stay, And now, the Future beckons us away. Poem No. 525; c. 11 May 1877 The Return of the Columbine Thou comest again, in bright scarlet drest, To cheer the heart, and to please the eye; To nod o'er the ground sparrow's lowly nest, And lure the bee as he wanders by. And the beauteous sight the prospect fills, For wherever we turn we admire; Thou comest again to our rocky hills, Blushing deep with their summer attire. In every crevice thou findest a place, With thy beauty the rocks to adorn; The dark, craggy hillside thou lovest to grace With bright hues like the colors of morn. And the children come o'er the hills to roam, And gather in bunches thy flowers; Sweetest tokens they are, in many a home, Of their walks, and the glad summer hours. Thou comest again; and oft hast returned, With thy beauty and fragrance so sweet; But we other lessons than Nature's have learned, Nor hastened thy coming to greet. Oh, would that the beauty, so lavish and free, And that doth with each season return; We might, with the glad heart of childhood see, And the lesson it brings for us learn. Poem No. 669; c. 25 May 1877 Man's Accountability How shalt thou give account to God, O man, For all that in the body thou hast done, Since first thy life upon the earth began, Recalling every action, one by one? We cannot, save the memory quickened be, And every deed shall in God's light appear; And each the record of his life shall see, The evil to condemn, the good to cheer. Yet must thou give account, though weak and frail, And memory to its trust unfaithful prove; Say, shall the good, or evil then prevail? Unrighteous deeds, or works of mercy, love? For memory cannot die, but quickened lives, And in heaven's light a perfect record gives. Poem No. 201; c. 2 June 1877 Hymn The Cause of Peace The Ages pass;âyet still delayed The Cause of Peace on earth; The Cause for which the Savior prayed, Proclaimed e'en at his birth. The time of which the Angels sang In sweet, prophetic strains; When 'neath the stars, their voices rang O'er Judah's favored plains. Yes, still delayed; for passion, pride Usurp calm reason's throne; And nations in their power confide, And not in God alone. Yes, still delayed; but signs we see The fainting soul to cheer; That that blessed day is yet to be, That it may still be near. May we its glorious light behold Of Peace, and Truth, and Love; By Prophet-bards so long foretold, And Angel-hosts above. Poem No. 458; c. 16 June 1877 The Nodding Meadow Lily How came this modest lily fair, In this lone meadow here to grow; When other meadows far around Can no such beauteous treasure show? Has it from some far centre come, Where such fair flowers do most abound; Brought by the winds, or flowing streams, And here a soil congenial found? Or did it spring spontaneous here, When earth brought forth each plant and tree? Was this the Eden of its race? Can Science solve the mystery? He who the soil could ready make, And for each seed a place prepare, Could here transplant from far thy germ, Or here create, and for it care. Here, or in meadow like to this, Though far away, thy golden flowers First opened to the light of day, The pride of summer's sultry hours. Enough for me thy flowers to find, Admire their form and matchless grace; And own His love, who thus has given Peculiar beauty to the place. Poem No. 180; c. 20 July 1877 The Destruction of Public Property by Mobs With madness seized men their own works destroy, Nay their own lives; they know not what they do; Destruction for a time is their employ; In peace they would the scenes of war renew. 'Tis their own work their maddened hands pull down! For, in his Country, each one has his part, And each is sharer too in her renown; His are her works of skill, of use, of art. For, sadder than the ruins, is the thought, That men should lose their Patriotic Pride: Nor feel the stain, which their own deeds have brought On Liberty's fair name, they have denied; In one short hour of riot and of spoil Wasting the fruits of years of peaceful toil. Poem No. 837; c. 10 August 1877 The Barberry-Pickers The barberry's red with ripened fruit; The merry children come, And fill their baskets from its boughs, And bear their burdens home. What if their fingers oft are pricked With the sharp-pointed thorn; Or e'en a dress, by the thick briars, Is rent and sadly torn? A pleasant day among the hills The barberry-pickers spend; Nor passed in vain the happy hours, That work with pleasure blend. For many a lesson they shall learn From this fair Autumn day; Which, in the distant after years, Their toil shall well repay. New strength and health from labor come, They breathe a purer air, And in the bounty Nature yields They feel that all may share. Though learning of the school be lost, Forgot the printed page, The lessons Nature taught in youth They'll treasure still in age. Poem No. 461; c. 9 October 1877 Pompeii Amidst the dwellings of a distant age, As by the enchanter's wand we seem to stand! Science and Art illume the historic page, And far-off scenes we view as near at hand. Pompeii's daily life again appears, The noble Roman sunk in pleasure, ease; Forgot the virtues of his earlier years, When manly toil and deeds alone could please. So slumbered they; till, on their midnight sleep, Vesuvius showered its dense and murky rain, Burying their city 'neath its ashes deep, Like the doomed cities of Gomorrah's plain! Like them, still warning, in a voice sublime, Proud cities filled with luxury and crime. Poem No. 41; c. 16 October 1877 The Communion Why forms discuss, if that the soul is fled? Is the communion in the wine and bread; Or in the loving hearts, that would draw near A dying Savior's last command to hear? Ah, still have met again that little band, And in their midst the Savior still doth stand: Where Love doth break the bread and pour the wine, And they are one in fellowship divine. How few this fellowship of love profess! How few a dying Savior's name confess! For what are rites and forms? an empty show, If we their meaning, life, have ceased to know. Quicken in us, O Lord, the dying love, Fit us on earth for fellowship above; Where holy friendships shall be made complete, And all who love on earth again shall meet. Poem No. 819; c. 23 November 1877 The Winter Night Brief is the day, and soon the hastening sun Sinks in the west, its narrow circuit run. How much there is, through the long winter night, To cheer the mind, instruct us, and delight. When darkness hides earth's beauty from our eyes, We still may gaze upon the starry skies; And own the mighty Maker's hand divine, In suns and worlds, that with new lustre shine. The glittering constellations, o'er our head, Fill the deep musing mind with wonder, dread. What secrets there have been from man concealed, To angels' high intelligence revealed! To sister planets oft our gaze we turn; From each the thoughtful may some lesson learn. Each has some different history of its own, As each by its own color, form, is known. Now in conjunction Mars and Saturn see, As if almost one planet they might be; Then ruddy Mars moves on with swifter pace, And leaves behind slow Saturn in the race. But beautiful and bright beyond compare, Look, where the evening star shines silvery, fair, The near companion of the crescent moon, Again to part with her, alas, how soon! Each onward moving in its diverse way, While each doth still one heavenly law obey. How many gaze, with unobservant eyes, On all this beauty of the winter skies; On stars and systems, that in glory burn Yet from the sight no word of wisdom learn! Seeing they see, and yet not understand The works, and wonders of the Almighty's hand; Who launched in space this vast terrestrial ball, Yet notes the insect's flight, the sparrow's fall; Who bids unnumbered worlds their courses run, Yet guides the motes, that glitter in the sun. The wise, the musing, meditative mind More wisdom in the night, than day, may find; Heaven's gifts are not alone to labor given: E'en, in the hours of sleep, descend from heaven High thoughts and feelings, visions too sublime, That link eternity with fleeting time. Poem No. 76; c. 25 December 1877 The Coasters Upon the coasters' spreading sails December's sun is shining bright; And to their port, with favoring gales, They'll safely come ere falls the night; Secure from harm has been their way, No wintry storms have swept the bay. From yon high hill I saw their fleet, By many a gallant crew 'twas manned; A pleasant company they meet, And steer their courses near the land; Joyous, for now all danger's past, The rocky shore, the icy blast. But a few days; and others, tost, Strive manfully their port to reach; In storm and darkness they are lost, Their spars and rigging strew the beach; And frozen, stretched upon the sand, Lie some of that brave sailor band! In nobler fight they did contend Than that, in which war's heroes fall; In peaceful toil they found their end; War's strife the world doth glory call; But these should have a nobler name, Than heroes, on the roll of fame. Not with their fellow men they strove, To waste the earth, destroy and kill; But o'er the ocean loved to rove, To toil with courage, strength, and skill; And, midst the elements' fierce strife, To conquer, or to yield their life. Varied and strange life's shifting scene! Like ocean's ever changing form; To-day, all peaceful and serene, To-morrow, dark with clouds and storm; Oh, that we might in Him confide, Who to blest ends doth all things guide. Poem No. 753; c. 1 February 1878 The Message On the bare alder bough, I heard the sparrow sing; To me a message it had brought Of the returning Spring. No leaf had yet unrolled Its fresh and tender green, No flower, in all its loveliness, On hill or plain was seen. Its sweet out-pouring joy The winter's silence broke; Of the green trees, and vernal flowers, In plainest language spoke. Not by man's voice alone, God's messages are brought; The birds' sweet strain, the opening flower, Convey to us his thought. The sparrows' welcome song Will tell us of his love, And, though the Maker is unseen, His Presence with us prove. Its notes of joy and praise Proclaim his love, and care; And far and wide through all our land, Spring's joyful message bear. Poem No. 389; c. 11 April 1878 Do Nations Ever Become Insane? May not whole nations, as the single man, Become insane; and know not what they do: Deep-reasoning Butler asked. Past history scan, How oft its page proves his suggestion true. Founded on force, they their own law obey; The slaves of passion, and the lust of power; With no strong love for peace, or reason's sway, They folly serve, the madness of the hour! When will the law of Peace by all be known, Discord and war be banished from the earth; His lower nature be by man outgrown, And men assert their higher, nobler birth; And Arbitration rule, and not the sword, And history cease war's madness to record? Poem No. 326; c. 30 April 1878 Know Thyself Suggested by hearing Dr. A. E. Miller's Lectures on the Human Body. Who, with dull mind, can view man's wondrous frame; And not with deepest reverence and awe? For from the hand of God at first it came, And from his breath did life and motion draw. The bones, which show such marvellous strength and skill, The blood, which circulates through every vein, The ever-moving lungs the air doth fill, The pulsing heart, the all-directing brain. What higher knowledge than thyself to know? Though countless objects gain our time, and thought, On our own frame we scarce a thought bestow, The body thus so marvellously wrought; The type of that, which shall immortal be, From pain, disease, and death forever free. Poem No. 815; c. 3 May 1878 The Blueberry Blossoms Why pluck their flowers? Each might have been A ripe and luscious fruit, When summer months had fully come, And well the palate suit. The birds might there have found a meal; The children love their taste; Why pluck and bring the useless flowers, And thus God's bounty waste? Thus sense doth plead; nor for a flower A higher use can see, Than that it may become a seed, Or ripened berry be. The poet, in its blossoms fair, A nobler use can find; Of which, who love the fruit alone Are ignorant, and blind. In their sweet fragrance he delights, Their beauty fills his heart; And he on others would bestow What they to him impart. Nor deems it loss to sacrifice The low to higher need, That thus what might but please the sense, The mind and heart may feed. Man's life is not for bread alone, Nor worldly toil and gain; For beauty doth the soul inspire To reach a higher plane. Enough God's bounty too has given For all alike to share; Nor only for our earthly wants, But higher needs doth care. Poem No. 823; c. 28 May 1878 William Cullen Bryant No gloom o'er Nature's face is spread, Though to his rest her son is gone; He who her choir in song has led, And her bright crown, and laurel won. She comes in all her beauty bloom, To deck the forest, field, and hill; Her roses breathe their sweet perfume, Her songs the groves with music fill. Why should we mourn? with honors crowned, And length of days, he passed away; A nobler life than this has found, Why on the earth prolong his stay? Why mourn the Patriot, and the Man, Lover of Country, and his race; Who, in his broad, far reaching plan, Could all mankind as one embrace? Why do we mourn? for still shall live The strains, which Nature's self inspired; To other minds his genius give, And other hearts by his be fired. Poem No. 354; 12â21 June 1878 âAgriculture the Source of Individual and of National Prosperity.ââAnne Pratt. [I] The husbandman doth still go out to hire Men for his vineyard, which doth labor need; And of the idlers in the land to inquire, âWhy stand ye idle?â âUp, and sow the seed, That in the Autumn shall rich harvests yield; Plant fruitful trees, and vines on every side, On every hill, and in each fertile field; Like a fair garden make your Country wide.â But idle in the market place they stand, With folded hands, and discontented mind; While all untilled, unpeopled lies the land! Murmuring, that none can now employment find; Or of the goodman of the house complain, That others for their labor more should gain. II. Where spring the cornfields in their tender green, Or bend and rustle in the summer breeze, Where in the Autumn, year by year, are seen The reapers gathering in their golden sheaves, There dwell domestic happiness and peace; No more wild savage wanderers men rove; From their fierce strifes, and idleness they cease, And in the peaceful arts of life improve. Dwellings are reared, beneath their roofs are born Children, with beauty, strength the home to grace; The virtues, which humanity adorn, Can find on earth no more congenial place; The love of kindred, neighbors, country, friends, Unto the spot a heavenly glory lends. Poem No. 514; c. 26 July 1878 Pleasure With business haste, or with a worldly mind Men Pleasure seek, as they some work would do; But in the beaten track they fail to find The rest they need, or prize that they pursue. In some by-path, or quiet nook she hides, Away from public haunts, and worldly eyes; With those who love her truly there abides, And with her choicest gifts doth them surprise. The tired laborer doth find her there, At home returning from his daily toil; The city dweller doth her visits share, Fleeing the city's dust, and loud turmoil; While crowds, that speed in haste o'er land and sea, But seldom meet, or share her company. Poem No. 834; c. 16 August 1878 On The Late Tornado, At Wallingford, Conn. With aimless fury hurries on its path, For so it seems unto man's narrow mind, The dread tornado, messenger of wrath! Like to some maddened giant strong and blind. Yet Mercy guides its course, confines its sway, From the beginning to the appointed end; For Nature's forces all One law obey, And none can its allotted bounds transcend. The stormy winds, O God, thy word fulfil, As doth the gentle breeze, that whispers peace; All are obedient to thy holy will; Thou dost command, and fiercest tempests cease; And men, with grateful hearts, again rejoice; Awed, chastened, humbled, by thy Sovereign Voice. Poem No. 832; c. 30 August 1878 Hymn Though few, with noble purpose came Our fathers to this distant wild; A Commonwealth they sought to frame, From country, and from friends exiled. Religious freedom here they sought, In their own land to them denied; With courage, and with faith they wrought, Nor monarch feared, nor prelate's pride. That Commonwealth to power has grown, Religious liberty is ours; What now we reap their hands have sown, And changed the wild to garden bowers. The trees they planted year by year Still yield their precious fruit, and shade; Fair Learning's gifts still flourish here, And Law man's rights has sacred made. They from their labors long have ceased, On the green hill-sides saintly rest; Their sons, in wealth, and power increased, Have by their fathers' God been blest. Their noble deeds our souls inspire, Be ours their faith, and courage still; Keep pure the home, the altar's fire, And thus their cherished hopes fulfil. Poem No. 94â706; c. 18 September 1878 On the Neglect of the Study of History History repeats her lessons; oft in vain! For we to profit by her page are slow; She shows how States may eminence attain, How ignorance and vice their power o'erthrow; How Government was formed for noble ends, To establish order, vice and crime remove; But these, neglected, it to ruin tends, And what was made for good doth evil prove. So doth a noble river, that should bless And fertilize its banks on either side, Bursting its bounds, bring ruin and distress, And desolate a happy region wide! Ah, when shall man, if not by History taught, Learn from the wondrous works in Nature wrought? Poem No. 174; c. 29 October 1878 Christ's Final Victory Over men's graves we lightly tread! Ah, soon forgotten are the dead! âChrist is not risen,â we hear men say, âThere is no Resurrection Day.â âDeath over us will soon have power, To pleasure give life's little hour; Like leaves the generations fall, Death still is sovereign over all.â Ah thoughtless men, ah faithless Age, Not to believe the Sacred Page; That Christ at length o'er death shall reign, The final victory shall gain. That to the dead, who in Him sleep, He will his faithful promise keep; That, at his coming, they shall rise, Welcomed by angels to the skies. That e'en mortality shall be A sharer in his victory; Changed to immortal, it shall wear The heavenly image, wondrous fair. Let these high thoughts our souls inspire, Fill us with earnest, pure desire, That we the prize in Christ may win, His victory over death and sin. Poem No. 395; 26 November 1878 Thanksgiving Flowers Bright flowers! November's frosts and cold have spared, To greet us on this late Thanksgiving morn; A tender love for you, as us, has cared; The pansies still our garden plot adorn, Chrysanthemums, that, with the waning year, Round many homes in golden clusters bloom; And e'en December's stormy month can cheer, Stealing from many a clouded day its gloom. While grateful for the harvest we would be, Which with abundance fills our wide domain; In these bright flowers new tokens, too, we see Of the same Love, which gives the fruits and grain; And makes November's bare and cheerless bowers Bright with the hues of Memory's fadeless flowers. Poem No. 77; c. 6 December 1878 Original Hymn We welcome, with the opening year, Our Pastor, to this ancient fold; With words of love, and hope to cheer, The gracious Gospel, never old. In cultured ground the seed is sown, As in a good and fruitful soil; Long has this field the blessing known Of faithful laborers' care and toil. As come the swift returning years, May nobler aims our spirits raise; Faith triumph over doubts and fears, Move grateful hearts, inspire our praise. Our Father, may thy gracious word Quicken in all the life divine; 'Till we from error, sin, restored, Through Christ, thy Son, are wholly thine. Poem No. 767; c. 2 January 1879 Our Lighthouses The sun has set; but lit the Light, Which guides the vessels on their way; Far o'er the ocean's gathering gloom It sends its bright and cheering ray. Nor this alone; but many a lamp Along our coast and lakes will burn; Each, through the night, a guiding star, Till day's o'erpowering beams return. And faithful men their watches keep Through the cold, stormy, winter nights; They slumber not when duty calls, But rise, and trim their warning lights. Were one, before the morning dawns, To dim, or quench its guiding ray, How many souls might meet their doom! How many wrecks might strew the bay! Returning from a distant land, Joyful the Light the sailor hails; And guided by its friendly beams, Soon, safe in port, he furls his sails. Poem No. 578; c. 4 February 1879 The African's First Sight of the Ocean Dr. Livingstone's Travels. Without an end the world had seemed, A boundless plain, where they were born; Stretching beyond the setting sun, And where again it rose at morn. And so the ancients them had taught, Their fathers' fathers all believed; Nor of an end they ere had dreamed, But as the truth their words received. But when they saw the ocean wide, And all its grandeur on them broke; With wonder and amazement filled, The voice of Nature in them spoke. The world itself they seemed to hear Say, âI am finished! I am no more!â The world your fathers boundless thought, Is ended at the ocean's shore. The end! Oh thought beyond our grasp, Which earth, and sky, and ocean teach; To which all Nature witness bears, Though not in transient human speech. Poem No. 850; 4 March 1879 The Zodiacal Light Strange light, long lingering in the west, With its pale saffron glow! In vain thy origin we seek, Or mystery strive to know. Unlike the noonday's dazzling beams, Or sunset's colors bright, Or the moon's faint, reflected rays, Or the stars' silvery light; Art thou a radiance from the earth? Corona of the sun? Or light of meteor's golden band, Which round the globe doth run? We know not whence the radiant glow, That fills us with delight; On which, admiring, oft we gaze Till fading into night! A light, whose mystery allures The thoughtful, musing mind; And leads it on in wonder, awe, The hidden cause to find. Poem No. 443; c. 28 March 1879 Education What is it to educate a human soul? Is it to teach it how to read, and write, Grammar, Arithmetic; is this the whole? Can these alone teach it to live aright? Such knowledge is but means unto an end, Too oft to earth's brief, narrow sphere confined; But higher thoughts there are, that these transcend, Motives enduring as the human mind; The love of knowledge, human and divine, The love of goodness, purity, and truth; Happy the teacher, who can souls incline To virtuous ends, in early days of youth; And, while he useful knowledge doth impart, Inspires the soul, the teacher's noblest art. Poem No. 775; c. 11 April 1879 The Kingdom of Heaven In Its Growth and Coming a Mystery As swift the changing seasons come and go, That Summer comes before we are aware; And we are living midst its beauteous show, A new creation wonderful and fair; So, unperceived, God's kingdom cometh too! Hid from the slothful and the worldly wise; The heavenly seed is to its nature true, And in the harvest will thy soul surprise. By night, by day, there is an Unseen Power, That to perfection brings each word, and deed; Surely as buried grain or blooming flower Become in Autumn the perfected seed. We sleep, and rise; they grow we know not how, And soon the harvest waves, where went the plough. Poem No. 57; c. 6 June 1879 Azalea Swamp Just o'er the stony wall, And near the travelled way, The wild Azalea's fragrant flowers Their richest bloom display. The travellers, as they pass, Stop to admire their bloom; Or, wafted on the summer breeze, To catch the sweet perfume. Why seek in distant lands Azaleas costly, rare; When by the roadside bloom, for all, These, not less fragrant, fair? Here too the woodwax spreads Its brilliant cloth of gold, Richer by far than princes' halls Or palaces behold. Nor can their artists show, With e'en their highest skill, Such colors as are lavished here On swamp and rocky hill. Renewed from year to year, The picture never tires; Awakening thoughts and feelings deep No artist's work inspires. Poem No. 310; c. 27 June 1879 Guido's Aurora Not with bright forms alone, that please the eye, Aurora comes encircled by the Hours; Whose feet, in measure, tread the purple sky, Such forms as love to sport in Summer's bowers; But nobler forms, for duty's calls sublime, With garments fitted for life's daily toil; Knowing the worth to man of fleeting time, Nor fearing lest their shining robes they soil. Their earnest looks are on their business bent, To finish every task ere day shall fade; To use each moment for the purpose lent, Till falls on earth again the evening's shade; When the day's labors and its noises cease, And the night brings its gifts of rest and peace. Poem No. 370; c. July 1879 The Humming Bird Like thoughts that flit across the mind, Leaving no lasting trace behind; The humming bird darts to and fro, Comes, vanishes before we know. While thoughts may be but airy things, That come and go on viewless wings, Nor form, nor substance e'en possess, Nor number know, or more, or less; This leaves an image, well defined, To be a picture of the mind; Its tiny form and colors bright In memory live, when lost to sight. There oft it comes at evening's hour, To flutter still from flower to flower; Then vanish midst the gathering shade, Its momentary visit paid. Poem No. 317; c. 8 August 1879 Jupiter as the Evening Star Calm o'er the hills the evening star Majestic rises on the sight, Sending its brilliant rays afar To wake our wonder and delight. The evening shadows gently fall On all the varied landscape round, And a deep silence broods o'er all, As Nature sinks in sleep profound. And stilled the tumults in the breast, As on the lovely scene I gaze; For every feeling is at rest, Save that which fills the heart with praise. The hills are touched by the soft beams; As Memory lights the gathering shade, Where youth's bright hopes and golden dreams, In years long past, grow dim and fade. Shine lonely Star! the heart to cheer With feelings pure, serene, and high, Above this dark and earthly sphere, Where youth's fair visions never die. Poem No. 86; c. 16 September 1879 The National Thanksgiving The harvests with abundance fill the land, And call for gratitude and festive song; And industry revives on every hand, Which from war's wasteful scourge has suffered long. And fell disease, that wasted day by day, Is checked and staid, confined to narrow bound; That else might thousands and ten thousands slay, And desolate a fertile region round! Our fathers' God! who, in their sore distress, Did'st save from famine and from dangers dire, And gav'st them shelter in the wilderness; Our hearts with praise and gratitude inspire, For all thy mercies to our fathers shown, And for unnumbered blessings all our own. Poem No. 507; c. 27 November 1879 The Stock-Gilly Flowers When hides the sun behind the hills, And shortest days are seen; How beautiful are Christmas flowers, Or wreaths of Christmas green! All else has faded from my mind, That dark December day; Save that full wagon load of flowers, That stood beside the way. Stock-Gilly plants in bloom, for sale, Sprinkled with falling snow; That made the chill and wintry scene With warmest colors glow. And many a home those flowers made bright, When earth was brown and sere, Or buried deep beneath the snows, And naught around to cheer. And there, as in the open air, They shed their sweet perfume; Long years have passed, but linger still Their fragrance and their bloom. Poem No. 787; c. 23 December 1879 Spiritual Intercourse They cannot come to us though we May long for them to come; And leave, with us on earth to be, Their blest, eternal home; The parents we have loved so well, The children that we mourn, They cannot come, with us to dwell, From that mysterious bourn. They cannot come to dwell on earth, And leave their heavenly sphere; A life there is of higher birth, As earthly life is here; A life of holy service, love, Which here we but begin, Employs them in that home above, Which they have entered in! Yet in the brightness of the day, And in the shades of night, We are with them, with us are they Though not revealed to sight; For memory's bright unbroken chain Doth bind us heart to heart, Hope whispers we shall meet again, Meet nevermore to part. Ah, who would have them here again, To suffer and to die; To leave, for the abodes of men, Their happy homes on high? Better that we should patience learn, And strive like them to be; Than vainly sigh for their return, That we our friends may see. Cold winter's blasts they feel no more, Nor summer's burning rage, Disease, and pain, and death are o'er, The want and ills of age; And, in that peaceful, happy clime, War cannot hurt, nor kill; For past the fleeting years of time, Their mingled good and ill. No more with doubts they struggle on, Nor walk in Error's night; Their doubts and errors all are gone In heaven's unclouded light; For God their light and glory is, His truth their minds doth fill; And Christ doth own them now as his, Who did his Father's will. They come not; but to them we go, That higher life to share; The life begun by them below Midst earthly toil, and care; Whate'er of good, or ill we've sown, We then with them shall reap; We then shall know as we are known, No soul its secret keep. And, in our Heavenly Father's time, We shall united be; To share that intercourse sublime Of joy and purity; Oh, let us then for this prepare, While yet the light is given; That we the life and bliss may share Of those we love in heaven. Poem No. 638; c. 3 February 1880 Invitation to the Robin Come, Robin, come, and sing to me, âThe winter time has goneâ Upon the ancient locust tree, That silent stands, and lone. For pleasant now the spring-like days, I long thy voice to hear, And listen to thy morning lays, So full of joy and cheer. Thou art a Messenger of love, And dost glad tidings bring; Thy prophecy our hearts doth move, True Herald of the Spring! That soon the pastures will be green, The early flowers appear, The blossoms and the leaves be seen, And May's fair month be here. In thy glad message we rejoice, No longer then delay! We long to hear thy cheerful voice, And list thy morning lay. Poem No. 91; c. 12 March 1880 The Influence of Channing Stern creeds and outward forms must pass away, Their purpose served to guard the Life within; We hail the Advent of a milder Day, Whose dawn on earth at length we see begin! Channing, though thy frail form no more we see, Nor hear, as once, thy calm persuasive voice, Thou livest still! we hail thy Jubilee, And in thy growing influence would rejoice. The love of God and man thy simple creed; The love of man as an immortal soul, That has the slave from cruel bondage freed, And shall War's desolating wrath controul. Still may thy influence spread from clime to clime, And win new victories with the years of time. Poem No. 435; c. 8 April 1880 The Calling The Voice that spake to Abraham of old, Go, leave thy Country, to our fathers spake; And made them, with like faith and courage bold, The ties of kindred and of home to break. Austere and strict were they, yet kind and pure; Above the common level they had risen, And, taught by Persecution to endure, Their faith and hopes were fixed on God and heaven. Why name, among those worthies bold and true, Brave-hearted Endicott, who led the van; Or Higginson, who, midst the suffering few, Lent glory to the name of Puritan? Beyond the western ocean's farthest bound New homes they sought, a Commonwealth to found. Poem No. 587; c. 1878â80 Endecott Amidst a band of worthies bold and true The noble Endecott was in the van, The gallant leader of the suffering few, Who gloried in the name of Puritan. Austere and strict was he, yet kind and pure, Above the common level he had risen; And, taught by Persecution to endure, His hopes, like theirs, were fixed on God, and heaven. His wife and children with him too embark, His firm attachment to the cause to prove; What precious freight was trusted to that ark! Of Faith and Hope, of Purity and Love; When were such treasures on the ocean cast The sport of the wild waves, and stormy blast? Poem No. 39; c. 1878â80 Farewell âFarewell dear England, and thy Church farewell! Farewell all Christian friends abiding there!â Such were the words from Puritans that fell; A holy benediction, and a prayer, As from old England's coast our fathers sailed; Sweet memories and tender filled each heart, And o'er the sense of loss &amp; wrongs prevailed, How hard from homes and dearest friends to part! What gave them courage, o'er the ocean wide, To seek upon this wild, and unknown shore, Freedom to worship God, at home denied? And what sustained them in the toils they bore? Conscience, that doth self-sacrifice approve, And trust in God's protecting care and love. Poem No. 116; c. 1878â80 The Departure The tall white cliffs of England fade away, They leave with tears their father land behind; The monsters of the deep around them play, And onward swift they speed before the wind. Backward they gaze, alas! how soon have fled Their happy homes, green fields, and village spires; While all around the waves of ocean spread, As if the grave of all their heart's desires! Seaward they turn; but lonely, dim, and drear, The ocean stretches on as without end; And fancy peoples it with shapes of fear, And trials hard, with which they must contend; With many an anxious thought they seek their rest, Dreaming of home, though tossed on ocean's breast. Poem No. 476â581; c. 1878â80 The Petrels Day dawns again, with wondering gaze they see The stormy petrels skim the waves' rough crests, Or, lighting in the hollows of the sea, Securely sit as on their shore-built nests. And shall not He, who doth for these provide, Without a shelter and without a home, His children keep, and guard whate'er betide, Whate'er their straits, or wheresoe'er they roam? Such thoughts sustain;âfor oft, by humble means, The Lord instructs the lowly, trusting mind; Who on his arm alone for safety leans, Shall, in his Word and works, direction find; Whether on land, or sea, afar they rove, His guardian care and love alike, they prove. Poem No. 96; c. 1878â80 At Sea Day follows day, and week succeeds to week, And still they sail across the boundless main; New homes in distant regions far to seek, And civil and religious freedom gain. How little do the timid landsmen know Of sailors' toils, and watches on the sea; When night returns, when loud the tempests blow, What hardships, and what perils there may be! While safe beneath the sheltering roof they sleep, Nor heed the rising blast, nor dashing wave; The seamen must their watchful vigils keep, Lest ocean, at each moment, prove their grave; Or, driven by tempests on some desert shore, They see their native land and friends no more. Poem No. 97; c. 1878â80 At Sea Frail woman there and childhood's tender years Endure the hardships of the seaman's life; Yielding at times, unto their natural fears, While gazing on the ocean's fearful strife; How strange on the wide ocean thus to be! Where naught is seen around but sea and skies; Shall they again the shore in safety see, They ask? and westward gaze with longing eyes. The gorgeous clouds at sunset mock their sight With mountains, valleys, forests, harbors near; But, as they fade away, with fading light, Their high-raised hopes as often disappear; And farther e'en than ever seems the land, Which but an hour before, looked close at hand. Poem No. 137; c. 1878â80 The Sabbath Bright is the morn, and hushed is every sound,â For e'en the sea has stilled its tossing breast;â With reverent looks the seamen gather round, And, with the passengers, from labor rest. Hark, rising on the still, bright morning air, Their blended voices charm the listening deep; Succeeded by the solemn words of prayer, As, on the ocean, they the sabbath keep: The preacher then his lesson doth impart, Drawn from God's Word, and works, which they behold; His simple teachings touch and cheer the heart, As he the text of Scripture doth unfold, Of Trust in God; on sea, as on the land; Who holds us ever in his mighty hand. Poem No. 79; c. 1878â80 Land They near the coast; the land-birds hover round, Far out upon the ocean sent before; With flowers and leaves the rippling waves abound, Washed by the tide from off their native shore; The air with fragrant odors too is filled, Borne o'er the sea, from unseen, flowery fields, Forerunning signals to the seaman skilled, To whom each trifling thing some knowledge yields. No Lights on island, cape, or rock they see, By which to steer their courses through the night, They shorten sail, lest danger there may be, And anxious wait for morning's cheerful light; Day dawns at length, the land! the land! they cry, And the New World is seen by every eye. Poem No. 646; c. 1878â80 Salem They reach a harbor spacious and secure, With wooded islands at its entrance found; And fair, green pastures, springs of water pure, And pleasant groves of different wood abound; The rocky hills, that round about it stand, O'erlook the sea and country far and wide; Like the stern chieftains of their native land, They wear a look of freedom, and of pride: Salem they call the spot. Here peace and rest From prelates proud and kings they hope to find, With civil and religious Freedom blest; Such blessings God will give to all mankind; And break the double yoke and heavy chain, Which tyrants, for their race, have forged in vain. Poem No. 647; c. 1878â80 The Landing With flag unfurled along the shore they sail By pleasant cove and by the rippling beach, Till heard from land the joyous Planters' hail, As they a fitting place for anchorage search. These Planters welcome them with homely cheer, In their log cabins, on the rising ground; O'erjoyed from distant friends again to hear, That with success at length their prayers are crowned! Their joy how full how deep they only know, Who, sick with hope deferred, have waited long; What solitude was theirs, who here had dwelt Through two long winters in this forest wild, And many a storm and sad privation felt, By hope of aid from father-land beguiled! Poem No. 428â835a; c. 1878â80 The Old Planters Nor slightly pass those early planters by, Whose names and fortunes are less known to fame; Who can the nobleness and worth deny, Which ever must adorn a Conant's name? Or who o'erlook the few, brave pioneers, Who with him to this spot in duty clung, With none to help, through two, long, trying years. Would that by worthier verse their praise were sung! The Christian love that seeketh not her own, That envieth not another's gifts, was theirs; And while the name of Salem shall be known, Or one descendant in her glory shares, The memory of their virtues shall remain A theme for history and the poet's strain. Poem No. 359; c. 1878â80 Paradise How lovely in the warm September days, The hills, and groves, and winding rivers clear; Across the stream, where now I love to gaze, They named it Paradise, who first came here; And such, when Autumn changed the forests' hue, Dying their leaves a thousand varied dies, Did Salem seem unto the pilgrims' view, Bathed in the golden light of Autumn's skies! The grapes hung clustering from the lofty trees, The nut groves showered their ripened fruit around, 'Twas all their own to settle where they please, The scattered Planters only here they found; Or Indians roving still from place to place, As seasons came for fishing, or the chase. Poem No. 192; c. 1878â80 Naumkeck River Up Naumkeck they sail, and far explore, Upon each side, the unknown region round; Upon the left, the locusts line the shore, Where on the sandy bank they still are found; Upon the right, the oak and walnut grow, Towards the west, high rocky hills arise, Where pines and savins dark their shadows throw; While, at their feet, the grassy meadow lies; Within the woods strange birds unnumbered sing, The lively squirrels leap from tree to tree, The sun-bright brooks their crystal tribute bring To swell the tide that's hastening to the sea; On every side, where'er they turn their eyes, New sights and sounds the voyagers surprise. Poem No. 752; c. 1878â80 The Same Much they admire the wild flowers scattered wide, Their gorgeous asters, purple, white, and blue, The golden rod that fringed the river's side, And the wild rose on every side that grew. To each new object, bird, or flower, or tree, They give the old and fond-remembered name; And, though but slight resemblance there may be, Called by the self-same word, they seem the same. Another robin-red breast here they find, Their morn and evening meals with them to share, They teach their children to it to be kind, And oft, in winter, crumbs for it to spare; For not mere creatures of the earth we live, But to each scene ideal life we give. Poem No. 332; c. 1878â80 Winter The perils of the ocean safely o'er, Their hearts with glad emotions free expand; Ah, little think they of the trials sore, That wait them inexperienced on the land; Swift fly the warm and pleasant Autumn days, And Winter comes before they are aware; The falling leaf its near approach betrays, And morn and eve the keen and frosty air; The rudest dwellings they can scarcely rear, Before the blasts of Winter howl around; With their cold breath glassing the waters clear, And burying deep with snow the frozen ground, Making the unknown wilderness more wild, That late with such a pleasant welcome smiled. Poem No. 539; c. 1878â80 Location With sturdy blows the echoing woods resound, Startling their tenants from their leafy lairs; The lofty oaks and pines soon strew the ground, Where each a shelter for himself prepares. Between the rivers, on the highest land, They build their cabins to each other near; That they may thus the savage foe withstand; Though brave of heart, his cunning wiles they fear. Soon curls the smoke above the forest trees, Marking amidst the wild their chosen spot; Think not that palaces alone can please; Contentment loves to dwell in humble cot, Where Piety and Industry reside; But shuns the gilded domes and halls of pride. Poem No. 845; c. 1878â80 The Home See! from yon low-roofed cottage shines a light, To guide the absent homeward on his way; On mantled bush, and tree, and meadow white, It throws its ruddy glare and cheerful ray. There, sheltered from the cold, the aged sire, And mother with their children gather round; Beside the hearthstone and the blazing fire, When day is o'er, their chief delights are found. The absent one they welcome from his toil, And for them all is spread the frugal board; Perhaps from sea he brings the fisher's spoil, Or home returns with what the woods afford; The sire doth bless, with grateful heart, the food, Sent from the bounteous Source of every good. Poem No. 412; c. 1878â80 The Home The supper o'er, with books, or converse sweet, Or lightsome tasks the happy hours they spend; Perhaps some tale of olden time repeat, Or welcome give to neighbor, and to friend; Of the new Country and its sights they tell, Of Indian wiles and savage beasts of prey; And now their voices loud in concert swell, As pleased they sing some simple, household lay. Dear Social Joys! that, on our journey here, Reflect the hues of heaven's serener clime; Through the dark vista seen of many a year, How brightly shines your lamp, undimmed by time, To guide the wanderer, wheresoe'er he roam, Till he shall gain his sure, eternal home! Poem No. 579; c. 1878â80 Sickness With sickness and with famine they contend, No help can reach them till another year; The dreary Winter seems to have no end, And oft the savage foe awakes their fear; From want, exposure, and attendant ills, Full eighty of their number sink and die; Grave after grave Death unrelenting fills, And side by side the strong and feeble lie! How dear is sympathy in our distress, As did the Puritans in trouble prove; A kind physician comes to heal and bless, The messenger of Plymouth's early love; Such help as sufferers can to sufferers send, The Plymouth pilgrims to their brethren lend. Poem No. 842; c. 1878â80 Longing How oft, with homesick hearts, their fancy flies Back to Old England o'er the wintry main; And thoughts of distant friends bedew their eyes, Whom they on earth may never see again; Musing they start! amid the deepening gloom, And think the forms of distant friends they see; And e'en at times, within the darkened room, The buried dead with them would seem to be! Sickly and weak how oft, with anxious gaze, From yonder hills they searched the ocean o'er? Spring slowly comes, with many backward days, Before the longed-for fleet has reached the shore; When scarce provisions for a week remain, Their failing strength and courage to sustain. Poem No. 196; c. 1878â80 Winthrop's Fleet But help arrives! The welcome fleet appears! From the high hill-top first by one perceived Far out at sea; then up the harbor steers; Scarcely for joy the tidings are believed; Soon friend clasps friend in heartfelt warm embrace, Awhile their mutual sufferings are forgot; Mindful alone they see each other's face, And share again for life each other's lot. And welcome too the comforts, and supplies, Which, in their strait, the timely vessels bring; From house to house the message quickly flies, To each how precious then the smallest thing; Taught by stern want, and hard necessity, In things we little prize their wealth to see. Poem No. 83; c. 1878â80 Arabella Johnson As fades the delicate flower of Southern skies, Transplanted to our cold New England shore, At the first chilling touch of Winter dies, And we behold its beauteous tints no more; So did the Lady Arabella fade! The fairest flower of Winthrop's numerous band; Near yonder shore her fragile form is laid, Mourned by each plaintive wave that beats the strand! A courtly splendor and a life of ease She left for one of trial, want, and pain; Seeking her conscience, and her God to please, And counting loss for Christ eternal gain! A ministering angel to his suffering fold, She shared the hardships of the strong and bold. Poem No. 53; c. 1878â80 Spring The Spring returns, and, with fresh ardor filled, Their interrupted labors they renew; The land is cleared, the virgin soil is tilled, Some the stout oaks for houses fell and hew, Some build a fort against their savage foe, Some guard from beasts and birds the springing grain, While some in boats to sea a fishing go, To dare the perils of the stormy main; With energy and zeal the work proceeds, No one is idle, and they all unite In common cause, as each assistance needs, By which the heaviest labors are made light; For the same ardor every bosom fires, And one great object here on earth inspires. Poem No. 572; c. 1878â80 Motive They came not from afar from lust of gain, Which lures adventurers to a distant shore; Nor followed they some mighty conqueror's train, Whose track through earth is red with human gore; No common purpose did their souls inspire, No earthly object did their vision fill; God's Kingdom here to found their sole desire, And, unmolested, here to do his will; For this He called them from their native land, For this He led them through the pathless sea, For this upheld them by his mighty hand, In sickness, death, and bitter poverty; Causing e'en savage hearts to melt, and share With them, in their distress, their scanty fare. Poem No. 637; c. 1878â80 The Church Soon to his Name they rear a temple rude, Where they may worship God, the Lord of all; First Church of Christ, in this vast solitude, Gathered and formed obedient to his call. With simple forms, they, for themselves, ordain A pastor, and a teacher them to lead; Their minds in their great trials to sustain, And with the bread of Life their hunger feed. Amidst the service, lo! a pilgrim band, By adverse winds and waves, till then delayed, From Plymouth comes; to offer the right hand, With messages of love, and cheer conveyed; May sacred bonds, thus formed in early day, Endure when temples built with hands decay. Poem No. 431; c. 1878â80 Worship But, still preserved by pious care behold, As if too sacred for Time's ruthless hand, The house our fathers built to God of old, Its ancient form unchanged as once they planned! Assembling there they meet for praise and prayer, And reverent listen to the preachÃ©d word; As Higginson, with eloquence, declares The truths of God with which his soul is stirred. In psalms and hymns together too they raise Their notes of gratitude and holy joy, No tremblings mingle with their tuneful lays, For none there are their worship to annoy; Inspired with Christian liberty they sing, And with their songs the desert places ring! Poem No. 84; c. 1878â80 Song They sing of Zion, city built of old, Jerusalem compacted, high, and fair; Whither the tribes went up their feasts to hold, And where established thrones of judgement were. They sing how God, in ancient times, had led His chosen people through a desert way, How He by miracle their hunger fed, And mighty acts by Moses did display; How He drove out the heathen from their place, And gave his people in their land to dwell; That they might ever stand before His face, And of his deeds to children's children tell; And while they kept his holy just command, Inherit still, as theirs, the promised land. Poem No. 648; c. 1878â80 [Here let the Church her holy mission prove] Here let the Church her holy mission prove Of Truth and Liberty of Love and Joy The image of that heavenly House above Which naught again shall threaten or destroy Within her walls wide as the social state Through countless years may all the people throng With joyful hearts and countenances sedate To bow in worship and to join in song No more without her fold may Childhood stray To wander in the desert parched and wild Forgetful of the strait and narrow way By Pleasure's voice from virtue's path beguiled But happy in her sacred courts remain Its heart still young its robe without a stain. Poem No. 170; c. 1878â80 The Puritan Church and State I. They envied not the vast Cathedral's pile, Its high-hung roof filled with the organ's sound, Its pictured windows, and the long-drawn aisle, With dim religious light o'er all around; Its ceremonial forms seemed stiff and cold, No more the vesture of Immortal Truth; But rather like her cast off garments old, Which once she wore in infancy and youth. In manhood's form to them did she appear, From childish rites and childish errors free, In virtue and in discipline severe, And beckoned them across an unknown sea; In a new world, with worship free and pure, To found a Church which ever should endure. Poem No. 641; c. 1878â80 II. New depths of truth within God's holy Word, They saw from age to age would be revealed; As men, to Revelation's light restored, Pondered the Book by Priestcraft long concealed. By this the Reformation of the Church they sought, That pure and perfect it might rise again; Built on the Corner Stone, that brings to naught The creeds and systems formed by erring men: The right to search the Scriptures they maintained, Each for himself, unbiassed and alone; Such was the right, which Christ himself proclaimed, Who would to every soul his truth make known; That each from human bondage might be free, And all in one great family agree. Poem No. 352; c. 1878â80 III. Not bound by slavish bondage to the Past, They a new form of Government unfold; Which shall the mighty monarchies outlast, Founded by kings and conquerors of old; For this was founded on the Rights of man, And all alike might in its freedom share; No worldly scheme, no narrow, selfish plan Did they for this vast continent prepare. Self government their high and noble aim, Events their teacher, Providence their guide, Their Polity a gradual growth became; Oft was the State by error, conflict tried; Yet still advancing towards the perfect goal, The highest good and welfare of the whole. Poem No. 361; c. 1878â80 Appeal Ye who behold the State in grandeur rise, By Industry and Virtue still sustained; Learn, from the page of History, to be wise! By the same arts it rose a state's maintained. Remember too your fathers' early toil, When first adventuring to this distant shore; How slowly they subdued the stubborn soil, And every want and every suffering bore, For Conscience' sake, that doth uphold the just; From their example learn ye to endure, And in your fathers' God, still place your trust; So shall you find his word of promise sure, And, when you hear of Massachusetts' name, Blush with an honest pride to own her fame. Poem No. 857; c. 1878â80 Influence of Puritanism See, gentle as the light, their Influence spread From state to state, from east to western shore; Till, like the night, the shadows all are fled, And Ignorance shall cloud our land no more. The Indian tribes, far wandering shall behold The beams of knowledge on their pathway shine; And of the Gospel's sacred truths be told, And own their power and influence all divine. The African, with new awakened mind, Rejoice in Freedom's full and perfect day; And blessings, in the coming ages, find, Far more than shall for all his wrongs repay; And universal as the race of man, Shall be the name and praise of Puritan. Poem No. 413; c. 1878â80 The Bible That Church they founded on the Word of God, Thy Word is Truth, their single, only creed; Obeying this they feared not princes' nod, And this from prelates' iron yoke had freed. As the One Spirit did its words reveal, They strove its holy precepts to obey; From this in Church and State was no appeal, For none God's just commandments could gainsay. Within the family, and in the school, That Word was morn and eve devoutly read; Ye, their descendants still observe the rule, Not by the letter, but the Spirit led; So shall our social fabric stand secure, Long as the sun, and moon, and stars endure! Poem No. 456; c. 1878â80 The Common School The School-house next they build, a structure small, Near to the Meeting House, upon the green; A noble structure built, like that, for all, Noble, though in appearance rough, and mean; But judge not by the sight, the purpose scan; An angel guest oft comes in lowly guise; And, on some narrow scale, the mightiest plan Works unperceived, at first, by human eyes: Here all the young were taught to read and write, The rich, and poor the same great boon enjoyed; So long withheld in Superstition's night, Who would the mind's fair Temple have destroyed; And those, who sought to instruct, and bless mankind, Within her dungeons' rayless depths confined. Poem No. 555; c. 1878â80 A Christian Commonwealth Seeking a Christian Commonwealth to found, Our fathers deep its true foundations laid In pure Religion and in Learning sound, By wise instructors to the young conveyed; They sought no harvest, where they had not sown Broad cast the seeds of Christian knowledge pure, They knew that by its fruit the tree is known, By Virtue only can a State endure. In vain did they unto the red men preach The truths, revealed by God mankind to save; In vain the arts of life they sought to teach, And Learning's lore upon their minds engrave; Heedless of knowledge, they must soon decay, Before a wiser race they melt away! Poem No. 416; c. 1878â80 Discontent Sigh not for richer lands, nor milder skies, Ye whom these hills and ocean's prospect bound; Within the mind itself man's fortune lies, And where men are, are power and riches found. Sigh not for California's golden strand, Nor covet the broad prairies' richer soil; By steady industry on sea and land, Your frugal wants supply by honest toil; And richer harvests in the virtues reap Of those, who made these rocky shores their home, And here on sunny hill-sides saintly sleep; Than they, who to earth's farthest borders roam; For these have left to earth, and sea, and sky, A beauty of the soul that cannot die! Poem No. 421; c. 1878â80 Conclusion Descendants of the Puritans! whose fame Shall brighter grow with every coming age, See that ye tarnish not their honest name, But add new lustre to the historic page; Yours are the Church and State for which they fled Their father land, and sought this distant shore; For which in after times they fought and bled, And every want and every suffering bore; In their free spirit still your rights maintain 'Gainst every secret, every open foe; The laws of God above all laws sustain, And in your minds and hearts His precepts know; Till earth, restored from error and from sin, Her great Millennial Day of Love and Peace begin! Poem No. 99; c. 1878â80 The Old Organ Of The East Society Salem Burdened with precious memories of the past, How oft again thy mighty voice I hear; Now rising, like the solemn swelling blast, Now falling sweet and plaintive on the ear! Expressing all the heart unuttered feels, Its longing for another, higher life; The grief and sorrow that no word reveals, The outward conflict, and the inward strife. And as the organist, with ready skill, Touches the keys; again the School I see Gathered around, and all the choir they fill; Still lingers in my heart the melody Of youthful voices, joined in concert sweet, Within the choir, where we were wont to meet. Poem No. 82; date unknown On Some Beautiful Crocuses In Front of the House of B. H. Silsbee, Esq. Fair flowers! that open to the April sun Your beauteous petals, purple, white, and gold,â We joy with you that winter's race is run, And gone its months of barrenness and cold. There breathes around us now a softer air; In frequent showers descends the quickening rain, That doth the frozen earth for man prepare, That he may sow for food the fruitful grain. Not vain your beauty, though no outward good You minister to man, and quickly die; You fill his soul with hope, with heavenly food, And higher wants than those of earth supply, Long may you bloom, with each returning year, The passer-by with pleasant looks to cheer! Poem No. 109; date unknown The Return of the Savior Lo Christ returns! But where is love, The love he showed for men; Does he behold it, here on earth, Returned to earth again? Lo Christ returns! But where the faith, Which here on earth he sought; The faith which overcomes the world, And mighty works has wrought? And where is hope, which cheers the soul, The Spirit's fruit and joy; Which doth like faith, and hope abide, And naught can ere destroy? Ah, where are these? we see them not; But, Lord, we still believe; Increase our faith, increase our love, That we may thee receive. Poem No. 318; date unknown The Kingdom of the Truth Not of one sect thy kingdom is, O Savior, Guide of man; 'Tis his whoever loves the truth; E'en since the world began. A kingdom 'tis of Righteousness, Of Purity, and Love; Which all on earth, who seek, may find; As in the heavens above. Whoever does confess thy name, Whoever hears thy voice; Shall in that kingdom have a part, And in its light rejoice. It shall destroy the works of sin, Which in the world abound; The lofty towers of error, pride, Shall level with the ground. Great is the truth, omnipotent; It cannot faint, nor fail; O'er all the earth, in every land It shall at last prevail. May each a faithful witness bear, Truth's kingdom enter in; And, while on the earth we dwell, Its heavenly life begin. Poem No. 365; date unknown Sunset after a Clouded Day in April O'er all the city comes a glow From the red setting sun; Clouded since morn, it doth bestow A smile when day is done. Its dwellings and their chimneys blaze With the red crimson light; The lofty steeples catch the rays, And draw the admiring sight. The leafless elms a glory wear; Their buds of golden brown, Touched by the parting sunbeams fair, Become a beauteous crown. The busy streets the radiance fills, We walk on heavenly ground; The sudden glow lights up the hills, And all the prospect round. Too bright, too beautiful to last, This light o'er Nature spread; A few short moments, and 'tis past! The golden gleam has fled! Poem No. 379; date unknown Hymn Prayer for the Gift of the Holy Spirit Oh, heavenly gift of Love Divine, The Spirit's grace and power; Come, in our hearts abide, and shine; How long delayed thine hour! âAsk and receive,â the Savior said, âAnd seek, and ye shall find;â For we are weak without thine aid, Without thy light are blind. Our heavenly Father loves us all; More ready He to give, Than we upon his name to call, To turn to Him and live. Lord, for thy coming us prepare, As Spring's soft showers the earth; That we may, in the harvest, share, The soul's new life, and birth. Oh, make us worthy of thy love, May we thy words believe; Thy faithfulness now these shall prove And thy best gift receive. Poem No. 382; date unknown Hymn Our voices with our hearts we lift To thee, O God, in grateful praise; For every good, and perfect gift A song of gratitude we raise. Thine is the seed in Spring we sow, And thine the harvests that we see; Sunshine, and rain Thou dost bestow, And strength to labor comes from Thee. Thine is the fragrance of the flowers, And beauty, that delights the eye; And thine the hues of Autumn's bowers, Which in transfigured glory die. O God, with all thy gifts still give The grateful, and the trusting heart; So shall our souls have learned to live, When called from earthly scenes to part. Poem No. 394; date unknown Hymn The Forms of Nature, and the Unity of their Origin Seek not, in outward things, The origin and birth Of animal, and plant, and seed, In air, or sea, or earth; In vain their history we trace Through ages vast, through time and space. From One Eternal Mind Have come the forms we see; Those countless forms, whose difference make Nature's variety; Each stamped with impress of its kind, And each to its own sphere confined. No atom but obeys The One Creative Will; Whose Word, beneficent and good, The universe doth fill; Without which naught was made, or born, Which was before Creation's morn. Globule and secret cell A history contain; Which Science, with its marvellous powers, Still seeks to read in vain; To the All Perfect Mind alone Their origin, and types are known. In Nature's primal plan Prophetic types we see; Which lead us onward up to Man, Their end, and destiny; A unity of mind and thought Through every form and being wrought. But, in her labyrinth lost, Too oft we miss the clue; Which, midst her ever varying forms, Runs through the old, and new; And in phenomena we rest, As of the truth itself possest. Rest not, O Soul, till thou That clue, that thread shall find; Without whose constant, guiding help, We wander dark and blind; In endless mazes led astray, Missing the strait and narrow way. For this still upward leads; Steep is the mount of Thought; Which we, aspiring still, must climb, Till to the summit brought; Where, with clear vision, we discern Nature's vast realm, her mysteries learn. Poem No. 414; date unknown Friendship To J. M. S. Sweet as it is for seamen, who have sailed Long weeks with naught but sea and sky in view; When they some friendly barque at length have hailed, And the same course with her awhile pursue. With gently-wafting wind they onward glide, In pleasant converse pass the favored hour; They part; but on the lonely ocean wide, Midst other scenes, how oft they feel its power! So sweet it is upon the voyage of life, Midst heartless intercourse to meet a friend; And for a time forget its cares and strife, While mind with mind and soul with soul doth blend! Would thus my friend that we might often meet To enjoy the hours, alas, how few and fleet! Poem No. 449; date unknown Hymn The Good Fight The battle is within, And not on outward plain; 'Tis there the conflicts first begin And longest shall remain. Our word, our thought, our deed, That battle still makes known; We are not from the conflict freed, Till sin be overthrown. The world doth claim the soul, As well as outward things; It seeks the spirit to controul, Its hidden, vital springs. The motive thou must scan, Which doth thy spirit move; For 'tis the motive makes the man, And doth his virtue prove. Thou needst a heavenly power, A mightier strength than thine, To guard thee in temptation's hour; O, seek for strength divine. Not with an outward foe Must thou the battle wage, A mightier contest thou must know, Than warriors' martial rage. Watch, pray, that thou mayst be A victor in the strife; And God from sin shall set thee free, And give eternal life. Poem No. 462; date unknown The Day calling us to a New Life The day goes on, but we are left behind, Bright with its robes it travels o'er the earth, Seeking its sons, in every land, to find, And tells earth's children of a heavenly birth. From early dawn to eve it travels on, But few its beauty see, or hear its voice; When, in the west, its glorious form is gone, How few are they, who in its light rejoice! 'Tis but the natural day, that we perceive, Its spiritual beauty's hidden from our sight; The gifts of sense full gladly we receive But fail in higher gifts to find delight; We live but as the children of the earth, When the day calls us to a nobler birth. Poem No. 484; date unknown To the Misses Williams, On seeing their beautiful Paintings of Wild Flowers The flowers of Spring had faded from my sight, The summer flowers had come, and quickly gone; Autumn was here; of Flora's children bright Asters and goldenrods were left alone. But, in thy pleasant room, their beauteous hues And forms we saw restored by hand of Art, That Nature's vanished scenes again renews, To charm the mind, and cheer the saddened heart. There violets and houstonia sweet, Bloodroot and blue hepatica still bloom, And blushing roses, from their wild retreat, Make Spring and Summer inmates of thy room; Why roam, O Artist, to a distant land, With lovely scenes, and flowers so near at hand? Poem No. 499; date unknown Jacob wrestling with the Angel The Patriarch wrestled with the angel long, For though of mortal race, yet he was strong; Nor would release him at the break of day, That he might take his upward, heavenly way. Bless me, he cried, ere I shall let thee go, Thou art an angel, and no mortal foe; Who, through the night's dark hours, couldst thus maintain With me a contest on the starry plain. What is thy name? the angel asked again, For thou hast power alike with God, and men. Jacob, he said. The angel blessed him there, Henceforth the name of Israel thou shalt bear; Thou hast prevailed, thou art a Prince indeed, A blessing rest on thee, and on thy seed. Deem not that to those ancient times belong The wonders told in history, and in song; Men may with angels now, as then, prevail; Too oft, alas! they in the contest fail. Their blessed help is not from man withdrawn, Contend thou with the angel till the dawn; A blessing he to earth for thee doth bring, Then back to heaven again his flight will wing. Poem No. 538; date unknown Rain Clouds The promises they give, alas, to fail! They bring not to our hills and fields relief; To distant regions onward still they sail, Leaving the hopeful husbandman to grief. Perhaps less earnest for the gift he prays Than others where the rain clouds hastening go Thus to our coast the blessing God delays Who freely doth on all his gifts bestow. Perhaps more needed than with us the rain, More dry and parched than ours some distant shore, Without its aid man's labors prove in vain, And he his blighted harvest sad deplore. How little still of what we need we know, How soon we yield to doubt, or dark despair, How are our minds engrossed with things below, How weak our faith in God, our trust in prayer! To us, perhaps, upon its humid wings Already doth the wind commissioned speed To swell the rivers, fill the falling springs Relieve distress provide for future need. Poem No. 545; date unknown The Soul in Dreams The soul heeds not, though darkest night Each object doth conceal; In dreams it sees the noonday light, Which all things doth reveal. Nor doth it heed the Winter's snow, That deep around it lies, Nor wintry winds that piercing blow; But in sweet dreams it flies Where Summer clothes each vale and hill, And plucks its fruits and flowers; And wanders freely at its will Amid its blooming bowers. To gardens ever green and fair, Where blooms the deathless rose, Where deathless lilies scent the air, It oft in slumber goes. 'Tis not to sense, nor Nature kin, Nor grows it ever old; Though dim the eye, and mind within, It can its youth behold. For 'tis of a celestial birth, And casts around it here A glory, that is not of earth, But of its native sphere. Poem No. 569; date unknown Our Native Sparrows The sparrows still are lingering here, Though winter-time has come; Within the swamp, or piny wood, They find a sheltering home. They flit along the turnpike's side, As in the early Spring; Though they no songs of pleasant cheer May to the passer bring. Nor are they left, when Autumn's past, To perish in their need; They still find every want supplied With berries, grain and seed. They need no care of man to feed, Nor for them to provide A shelter, in the wintry storm, Where they may safe abide. Our heavenly Father cares for them, Who cares alike for all; He made their shelter from the cold, And hears their feeble call. Poem No. 570; date unknown Hymn I Am The Way The way! ah, who could tell, as well as thou, The way to God, the way no man had found; Wherein who walk shall never go astray, Where joy, and peace forevermore abound? The narrow way of suffering, pain, and death, Thou didst pursue enduring mortal ill; That thou might'st teach mankind the way of life, Obedient to thy Heavenly Father's will. Thus plainly didst thou show that way to men, Thou wast the way, the way and thou were one; And, when thy course was finished, thou didst say, The work thou gavest me, O God, is done. Then to the Father, thou didst upward soar, To strengthen fainting souls with gift divine; The Spirit thou didst send to guide, and help, And make thy feeble followers wholly thine. Ah, why should men that perfect way neglect, Or having found, still from it go astray? Is there another path than this more plain, Is there another guide than Christ, the Way? To whom, O Savior, may his followers say, To whom, but thee, for guidance shall we go, Thou art the Christ, the anointed Son of God, And dost to all the Heavenly Father show. Poem No. 590; date unknown Early Companions They are not dead, but gone before! Their love doth still remain; Another life will them restore, Unite the broken chain. They loved the things, which here we love, Their hearts were kind and true; And in the glorious world above, Their friendship shall renew. But here we wander sad and lone, As in a foreign clime; Till we again shall meet our own, Beyond the shore of time. They wait us in that happy land, As we are waiting here; With warm embrace with clasping hand, For each they love so dear. There death no more can friends divide, Nor sorrow grieve the heart; Beyond time's bounds, death's narrow tide, They meet no more to part. Poem No. 636; date unknown The Gift Thou gav'st me many a fragrant flower, But I have given them all away; To restore thy gifts I have no power, And when Thou ask'st;âwhat shall I say? I'll say Thou taught'st me too to give, And I but did what Thou hast done; By doing what Thou do'st I live;â And then Thou'lt call me, Lord, thy son. 'Twas Thou who gav'st them all their bloom, Each colored leaf its differing hue; And could I selfishly presume What Thou hast made for all to view? Their sweet perfume they caught from Thee, That scented hill and lonely vale; And could there dwell aught good in me, And not for others too avail? 'Tis not thy gift; but that thy love Is infinite in great &amp; small For even the humblest flower can prove And show Thee Father all in all. Poem No. 675; date unknown The Soul's Opportunities To every soul, howe'er obscure its birth, A boundless heritage is freely given; The wealth, and beauty of the spacious earth, And the bright glories of the starry heaven. This goodly world, and all which it doth hold Were for man's use, and pleasure too designed; A school, in which he might his powers unfold, His various faculties of heart and mind. From such a school shall man go forth in vain, Squandered in foolish play its precious hours? Or from its lessons higher wisdom gain, And nobler use of his immortal powers; Till for an endless state he shall prepare, And in an angel's bliss, and knowledge share. Poem No. 736; date unknown The Book of Life My hands have long been busy cutting from each Day's paper the short tale or verse, that told To many that around me dwell the shade of grief, Or note of joy; as to my opening eye They flitted half-seen by. These pasted in The blank pages of my unfilled book stand as Life's true memorial. There every word The heart unconscious uttered, finding wings, Has flown to sing of its sweet birth. As birds From out some thicket scaped to tell to the open Fields and travelled ways the secrets of their Bower. There live! the record of the Past! To tell of him who from his labors ceased Enjoys the goodman's rest forevermore. Poem No. 338; date unknown For the Sailors' Fair Like gallant barque, with canvas spread, And streamers fluttering in the wind; The youthful sailor leaves his home, And all he loves on earth behind. His Country calls;âhe hears her voice, And boldly o'er the ocean sails; He cares not for its fiercest storms, Nor for an armed foe he fears. Nor, when, in port, disease has laid Its hand upon his manly frame, And far from home and friends he dies, Is he forgetful of her fame. His Country's flag, his chief delight, As bright it waved above his head; Is folded round his lifeless form, In honor of the noble dead! And shall the living back return Aged and sick, infirm and poor; Without a shelter, or a home, Begging their bread from door to door? No! Let them, conflicts wanderings o'er, In their last years find peace and rest; The comforts which the body needs The hopes with which the soul is blest. Here Christian Love's kind voice and hand Shall for their wants a Home prepare, And bid each friendless seaman come, And freely all her blessings share. Poem No. 316; date unknown Parting Hymn AirââAuld Lang Syne.â I. Now, parting from the festive board, A grateful hymn we raise; For all our favored fields afford, To God be all the praise. 'Tis He who gives each cloudless sun, 'Tis He who sends the rain; He blesses, when man's work is done, The fields of ripening grain. II. 'Tis He who gives us home and friends, All that we here receive; And gifts of Grace from Heaven He sends, By which our souls may live. Then, parting from the festive board, A grateful hymn we raise; For all the joys our lives afford, To God be all the praise. Poem No. 372; date unknown The Peace Congress the Promise of a Higher Civilization Thanks for the omen, that War's rule is spent, And Europe from a barbarous custom free! Too long her statesmen have their influence lent, And to the idol bowed a willing knee; A thousand voices heralded its fame, And History adorned each bloody strife; The nations gloried in their deeds of shame, And not in saving, but destroying life. In peaceful arbitration we behold The dawn of a new era for the race, That milder day, by prophets long foretold, When Reason's sway shall violence displace, Nations in peaceful arts alone contend, And War's dread conflicts shall forever end. Poem No. 455; date unknown Hymn to the Living The voiceless spirits, they who have given up The being that God gave; till hand, foot, and voice, Apart from him whom once they honored, Find their tasks without forethought or wish, These ever give thee back unto thyself, When wandering thou wouldst stray, a new-born man. I sing of them, for they have fallen asleep; And no voice comes back, nor motion shows them Living amid the dead, yet living still. Where are they? in your midst; the forms that night Radiant with fires discloses o'er your head, And day walks forth with, when bright-girt he comes; And thou but findst a lamp for thine own task, A moon and stars that still may light thee on Till finished the short race thy day begun. Motionless yet moving roll on their orbs, Measuring in shining planes thy little life Of days, and months, and years unnoticed save For them. Hail Forms, the eye sees not; and Tones, that speak But in the silent hymn of nature's praise! Hail ye, who touch no lyre, but that low harp That man can never hear till woke in God! Come forth, ye whom the tombs have held so long! Though but the shadows of your greatness fall Upon the sight, and echoes reach the ear; 'Twill strengthen us to rise, who now are dead, And follow on, where you have led the way. Long have we sought you, and in distant worlds; When ye were here amongst us; on your lives We live, yet ask we who you are, as men Forgotten. With the bud and leaf comes forth Daily the record of your excellence, In words that will not die upon our ear, Ye hidden all; as is the current sap, That weaves Spring's robe, or light that gives it hue. In you as her we lose our little selves, Forgetting in your bounties they who give. Great Teachers! born to be with God, and teach The letters of His wisdom; may we all Count costless till with you we live as brothers; Of the same Father, born to hear His word. Come! we will sit as children at your feet, And throw away the pride, that made us call They who were sent from Him, the Good, our equals. Pour, pour the rain from out your burial urns, Scatter the sun-beams on our wasted fields, Till blossoms, flowers, and fruit scent hill and plain; Yet will we shut our eyes on all, to see The Giver, and who teach to give like Him. Ye stand not on the numbered page of Time; But have withdrawn yourselves beyond the praise, The short-lived praise of men, to hear of God. The day on which you speak is called his own; The hour on which He calls us children bids Wait on you to learn our Father's acts; Whom first He honored with the name of sons. The world that is has vanished from your sight; Its journeys with your last-day's march complete: Teach us to walk the road that you have been, Made plain at every step by what you were; Invisible; still be to us as seen; Fresh breathing on us with each gale that blows, Our way still lighting with each sun that shines. Ye Unseen Messengers! Apostles sent By Christ, moving and finding voice in words! Forms! that visit human hearts as dwellings; Be near us ever, ever be our guests! The night is dying out; and ye begin To walk among us, Gigantic Shadows Flung before the rising sun; in early Morning's pale light seen, noticing the Day. And Thou, who givest all, whose children these; Ever Invisible! The Day in which all see! Amid thy gifts may we walk fearfully; Lest, lost in their profession, we find them Instead of Thee. Straying amid thy works We know Thee not; best seen in these thy sons; In whom Thine Image shines to light our way. Poem No. 589; date unknown</field>
