      <field name="fulltext">THE BLIFKINS PAPERS. TO A CAT. On finding one turned up in a corner of my front yard very dead. Thou howling, yowling, growling pussy, Thou night and day disturbing hussy, No more thou'lt wake the feeling fussy With thy fierce clamor, Driving the quietest to curse thee, Like tongs and hammer. Full many a night thou'st kept me waking, My nerves like aspen leaflets shaking, Till, some convenient missile taking,— A jug or boot,— I've dashed it in among ye, raking, And made ye scoot. Thy voice I knew, when fiercely bawling, 'Bove all thy brother's notes appalling, There, 'mid my flowers, pulling and hauling, And mischief making; But thou hast stopped thy caterwauling, And no mistaking. And yet I'm sad to see thee lying, Though long my patience thou'st been trying; I look upon thee, no denying, With feeling sickening, And wonder how thou felt'st when dying Of sudden strychnine. Didst thou look back with thought regretful At making people vexed and fretful, Or that thy horn of joy, not yet full, Should be capsizen? “Capsizen hisn porritch dishe.”— Canterbury Tales. Or grieve that thou wert such a great fool As eat the pizen? Alas! like many a fool that's human,— Seen every day, or man or woman, Who grasp at pleasures fair and bloomin',— Thou'st reckless bitten, And found too soon that sin's consumin' To man and kitten. MY TWENTY-FIRST WEDDING DAY. Twenty-one years!—and it weren't at all strange If in that time had happened many a change; The jolly young boy, in waist but a span, Is now a married and corpulent man; And my wife, then a damsel so tender and shy, Is as fat as a seal, and equally spry. I've sown my wild oats; I've cut all the crew With whom in my youth I put matters through; I gave up cigars as a tribute to love, And punch, that I prized all comforts above; I have put all pleasures of old under ban, Determined to life like a true married man. With my children around me, my wife by my side, Who's as dear to me now as when first my bride, I envy not those who are soaking their clay, Or are burning their lives in tobacco away, Content to remain here just as I am, As happy as is at high water a clam. Let fate do its best, or its worst, as it may; All luck is but accident, just, of a day; The good and the bad, the sorrows and joys, Are nothing at all but trifles and toys; I'll sit at my ingle, and say, as they fly, I'm watching the harvest to come by and by.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE MODERN SYNTAX. DR. SPOONER IN SEARCH OF THE DELECTABLE. I. On Monday morning, with the sun uprist, Good Dr. Spooner ate his steak in haste, And hurried down his coffee and his twist, As though no moment he would idly waste, Then took his cane within his sturdy fist, With animation on his features traced, And started forth in attitude reflectable, The author at the outset—before he has led the good doctor through any of the labyrinthine walks of life—with the independence of the poet, who will not be limited by the conventionalties of dictionaries, grammars, or common sense, claims the right to coin as many words as his opinion, or the needs of rhyme, may require. Hence the word “reflectable;” and the claim is introduced to disarm the critics of the Atlantic, North American, or Foreign Quarterly, who might snap at this seeming and only fault, as a pickerel might at a frog's leg. To seek 'mid airs mundane, the goal Delectable. II. Before him lay the undeveloped scene That Fate impatient waited him to show; He stood a moment with a thoughtful mien, As if uncertain which path he should go, Then held his cane his finger tips between, That, by its falling, he his course might know. North-east! 'Tis well. Now all my doubts at rest, Since chance so wills it, I'll go sou'-sou'-west. III. Not he, alone, to go adverse to Fate; Some do, with all prognostics pointing clear, And full success attending at the gate; They do not stop propitious hints to hear, But clutch at phantom shapes that tempting wait, Till, to their disappointment and their fear, They see their error and neglected track, With little hope of ever getting back. IV. All have desire to win the happy goal, And all strike out o'er some illusive gravel, Investing hope and earnestness of soul The mystery of the future to unravel, Finding, too oft, to their dismay and dole, Their road, like Jordan, very hard to travel— Their delectation, like the Paddy's flea. Within their grasp, and yet not quite to be. V. Diversity of tastes prompts divers aims, And, as the whim controls, men blindly go it, Pursuing here and there their little games, Through which, for bliss set out, they think they'll show it; Each plays his part, with equal hopes and claims, Trusting that Fate propitious will bestow it; But very few attain the culmination That gives the sought-boon of delectation. VI. Though, for that matter, comes the question up, What is the boon for which they thus are striving? Fill to the brim Joy's most enchanting cup, Some would reject it, other draughts contriving, Being more happy far to take a sup From sombre springs, or in their depths be diving; A strange anomaly we too often see, Where happiness is sought in misery. VII. No sympathy have I with such as these; But what they do is what they deem the best; The genial soul, the heart in fullest ease, Comes up the nearest my ideal of blest; We will not quarrel—each his pathway sees, And travels it for happiness in quest: Each to his taste, as the old lady said What time she kissed the tenant of the shed. VIII. So Dr. Spooner, with his heart aglow, Stood ready to attain the boon I speak of; The Fates had fixed the path that he must go By his cane's falling—you recall the freak of— But rested as he felt the breezes blow From a fair hill of which he saw the peak of, And thus addressed them, like a necromancer Demanding of unsentient things an answer: IX. “Tell me, ye wingéd winds, as on ye fly, Hast come from scenes where delectation waits? Point me, O winds, that spot beneath the sky Where perfect joy the craving spirit sates; Direct my steps, that I may quickly hie Where bliss unfolds its amaranthine gates!” The winds deigned no reply, but swifter sped, Tearing the doctor's hat from off his head. X. There is no more provoking thing I know Than this: to have one's hat torn from his pate. No sympathy doth any one bestow, And grins the awkward accident await; The curious crowd look on to see us go, As we pursue the fleeing thing of hate, Until, perhaps, some chap, a little faster, Plants his thick No. Twelves on our new castor. XI. He stood a moment when regained his tile, And on the incident reflecting dwelt; He paid the fact the tribute of a smile,— A feeling tribute, for the hat was felt. “I've chased this hat the fraction of a mile,” He said, “and this sage thought comes through my pelt: That, as I've won it, racing with the wind, ‘In the long run’ I happiness shall find.” XII. And, thus assured, he sped with eager feet, Caroming here and there as on he flew, Pushing some off the sidewalk to the street, And by collision bringing others to, Exciting talk we will not now repeat, And angry thoughts awaking not a few, When to a full stop was he quickly brought, Like a blue-bottle in a fly-trap caught. XIII. There moved along, exactly in his way, One of those well-made-up, artistic women, Who are, as one-might very justly say, One quarter flesh and blood and three fourths trimmin': He tried to pass her, giving ample play To all the furbelows about her streamin', When, spite of all his wary care and pain, He found his boots entangled in her train. XIV. He turned about and gazed on what he'd done, Confounded at the seeming mischief dire; But when he saw the spitefulness that shone Forth from her eyes, like that same baleful fire We read about, excuse he proffered none, But said, “If I am sorry I'm a liar; What right had she, at just that time, to spread Above the spot whereon I chose to tread?” XV. But in a moment more he felt contrite, And held his head down with emotion humble; He o'er the pave had no exclusive right, And, 'mongst her things-come-afterwards to stumble, He had endangered an annoying plight, At which she well might frown on him or grumble; And then he turned, repentant, but, a goner, He saw the lady turn a distant corner. XVI. And this impressed itself upon his mind: No one is happy disregarding others, As men are so untwistingly combined That rending one the great remainder bothers; And but as one is just, polite, and kind, And all his selfish aspirations smothers, Can he expect that happiness below Which the exalted soul alone can know. XVII. He moved along 'mid scenes of active life, And stoutly strove his object to attain; There was excitement in the pressing strife, But with it all there mixed a sense of pain; With selfishness society was rife, And finding all his expectation vain, Heart-sick and weary, with unlevel head, He turned himself towards home, and went to bed. XVIII. And then the dreams born of his urgent wish! Led through fair scenes that waking ne'er reveals, Feasting on spreads of flesh, and fowl, and fish, Quaffing rare drinks of most attractive seals, All right side up his favor-beckoning dish, Holding such cards as kindest fortune deals, Waking at morn with resolution stout, His quest for happiness to carry out. XIX. One day is like another in the race For some pet object, every else forgot; So the good doctor daily held his chase To find 'mong mundane scenes the blissful lot, The one strong hope to rest his weary pace When he should reach the delectating spot. Of all the spots that I know worth the trying A fifty spot is the most satisfying. XX. Thus, as with zeal elate he wandered out, His mind intent on seeking delectation, And with an eager eye he looked about, Giving all things a wise examination, Unheeding an admonitory shout, That of some danger made ejaculation, There came a snow-slide from some upper height, And Dr. Spooner disappeared from sight! XXI. A mingled feel waits accidents like these: A grateful thrill, like an unuttered prayer, As one from peril saved his status sees, And then a pressing tendency to swear, Which from oppressive wrath the temper frees, —So some folks think, in which I take no share,— But the good doctor, as he moved once more, Took stock in neither mood, nor prayed nor swore. XXII. In fact, just then in search for happiness, And doubtful if 'twere pious or profane, He would not compromise his chance for bliss, But non-committal would a while remain. Many another does the same as this, Desirous some pet object to attain; For policy and selfishness prevail, While interest steers and caution trims the sail. XXIII. The greatest pleasure that the world can give Is that we draw from intellectual sources; Freed from the sensuous dross in which we live, We 'mid the purer ethers vent our forces, And misspent hours we happily retrieve In following those crystal water-courses That flow from founts in mental mountains springing, And to our feet the choicest gifts are bringing. XXIV. So Dr. Spooner thought he'd take to books, And bought them lavishly,—all subjects choosing,— Having them placed in their adapted nooks, With catalogues their resting-place disclosing; Bound handsomely in calf, that graceful looks Might add attraction and enhance the using,— All books that might a reader's thoughts awaken, From Blood-and-Thunder Nibs to Friar Bacon. XXV. His heart ached at the woe of thrilling stories, Fraught with depictions of unreal life; He read in histories the crowning glories That flowed from fields of sanguinary strife; Philosophy and physics passed before his Eyes, with the light of ripe reflection rife, Yet betwixt Reade and Bacon he confessed He'd neither read, but thought Reade was the best. XXVI. Then borrowers came, and fastened on his hoard, Splitting his sets remorselessly to pieces; And in those cases where they were restored, They came back dog-eared and defiled with creases; Until, at last, beyond endurance bored, Said he, “From now henceforward all this ceases!” Then locked his door upon his precious shelves, And left his authors pondering on themselves. XXVII. The tempter whispered, “Go it while you're young! Taste the delirious tumult of the hour; The syren sings as sweet as e'er she sung, The senses plead with unabated power; Bring your dull soul joy's halcyon scenes among, And pluck, while yet it blooms, life's brightest flower; Don't mure yourself till felt years' chilling blasts, And quaff the cup of pleasure while it lasts.” XXVIII. In dissipation did the doctor dip, And strove to find what fun there might be in it. He pressed the sparkling goblet to his lip, Till his old head hummed like an ancient spinet; He joined in pleasure's jolly partnership, In wild adventure mixing every minute; But when he found his nose all raw and red, “There's very little fun in sport like this,” he said. XXIX. A wholesome lesson this, that all may learn Who try such roads to find the bliss they crave. They're lit by lamps that oil Plutonic burn, And lead through scenes that weaken and enslave; Brigands of Passion lurk at every turn To trip the feet of those their prowess brave, And the “good times” that lured the soul away, Are drafts on time, with no funds left to pay. XXX. Many of those these sprightly lines who read Know how it is themselves—no slang intended. Though fair the promise all too pronely heed, With honeyed hope and expectation blended, The hope soon prematurely goes to seed, And winter comes before the summer's ended; The roses turn to ashes 'neath the tread, And dirges wail the season that has fled. XXXI. Were I disposed a moral to indite, Here most unquestionably is its place: Don't wait repentance until appetite No more has power its progress to retrace; Complete worn-outness surely's not the plight To give repentance much, if any, grace. 'Twas no great merit in old Uncle Ned Corn-cakes to eschew with his teeth all shed. XXXII. He walked and pondered, with his brow erect, Devising in his mind which way to turn To gain the point his fancy did affect, Convinced, indeed, that he had much to learn Before he saw the beacon-lights reflect, That on the coast of pure enjoyment burn, When, lost in reverie, his reason fled, He found himself down cellar—on his head. XXXIII. A cellar doorway, though a fearful trap, Affords a cautionary moral, clear, To every visionary, dreamy chap, Impelled by contemplation high or beer, To heed his steps, lest they may chance, mayhap, To lead him, witless, into trouble drear. Although 'tis well uplifted gaze to show, We should have half an eye for things below. XXXIV. And the good doctor lay a moment thus, Not knowing how or why he should be there, The world all muddled in a precious muss, Concerning which he didn't know nor care; And then he rose, and said, “Ridiculous!” Running his fingers through his matted hair, In which confused and much-mixed-up condition, He felt just fit to be a politician. XXXV. In politics the doctor took a stand, And blurted with an unremitting zeal, Retailing dogmas up and down the land, Professing earnestly the public weal; Condemning all who, on the other hand, Chanced differently regarding them to feel, And was a cog-wheel active as could be In the great whirl of party enginery. XXXVI. As legislator, in the town and state, Across the stage with giant steps he strode; His was the dictum on which hung the fate Of mighty hobbies that the lobby rode; He took no bribes his act to compensate, And voted as the “greatest good” was showed; Rich only in the sense of duty done, And—certain gifts his self-denial won. XXXVII. Strange fancy his who seeks in politics For happiness; as well might he essay To honey find in husks, or oil in bricks Or new potatoes in New England May; His chiefest recompense the meed of kicks Constituents ungrateful always pay, And find he's purchased, when it is too late, A tiny whistle at a monstrous rate. XXXVIII. Sure delectation must be found in Fame, As Solomon had said 'twas more than riches; And so his sail he spread to catch a name, Courting each breeze to draw and test its stitches; His name appeared, with eulogy aflame, And all the slabber that the vain bewitches; Besides, his face graced each pictorial journal, With praise or blame allied—alike infernal. XXXIX. He talked his mouth for fame in every place, Was always found, wherever wished or not; From a street-corner speech to saying grace He rose to the occasion piping hot; Sometimes a slap he'd welcome in the face, And a nose-pulling now and then he got; But all such favors helped his little game To win the “glittering height” on which was fame. XL. His head grew dizzy on his lofty perch, —His reputation mere factitious show,— And, like a weather-vane upon a church, He turned just as the fickle wind might blow, Till counter breezes gave a sudden lurch, And down he came 'mong common folks below, The ridicule of every humble eye— The golden cynosure but gilt, brought nigh. XLI. For fame he'd sacrificed all thoughts of peace; Had found antagonism everywhere; Had lied and swore his chances to increase; Had tried philanthropy, and wore long hair; For every wheel he had the needed grease; In every public movement had a share; Denied himself all comfort for a name; “And this,” said he, “is all there is of fame.” XLII. In wit's display he next great effort made, And searched the dictionary through for puns, While such extreme abandon he displayed, His jokes popped off as though they had been guns; Grave people all around him were afraid, And 'gainst his influence bewared their sons, Bidding them think their sires ne'er acted thus, And calling him “disreputable cus- XLIII. Tomer,” which softens some the verbal force— Like the old clergyman of whom they tell, Who, vainly trying to secure his horse, By his momentum in the brambles fell; And, angered thereat, made the matter worse By shouting out vehemently, “O hell!” But seeing in an instant his offence, “Lelujah” added, which quite changed the sense. XLIV. The doctor made a laugh where'er he went— He had no scruple thus to serve them so; Even a funeral scene could not prevent, And where an undertaker had to go, His mates such unction to the season lent, He said, “What 'sprit de corpse these folks do show!” 'Twas villanous, but those the rue that quaffed Looked through their sables and at Spooner laughed. XLV. The Lecture Bureaus then must have him out, And curious people came from far and near, With buttons sewed on more than extra stout, Fearing to burst them with the fun they'd hear; He heard, one side, the injudicious shout, But something like a groan filled t'other ear; Snowed in and criticised, self-reproved and weary, He felt, as did admiring friends, 'twas dreary. XLVI. And next in Fashion's walks the doctor pressed, And clothed himself in most approved attire, With brainless glorying at being dressed Up to the standard that the modes require; From hat to boots resplendent as the best, With but to shine the limit of desire; And every one inferred, who chose to scan, That Dr. Spooner was a “killing man”! XLVII. But then the thought upon his senses stole, “What am I but an ape?—though not so mean Is mine as Darwin says was man's first role Before the footlights of this earthly scene,— The copy but of others, with a soul That grasps infinitude—too grand, I ween, To spend its faculties in such base use As hatching goslings from a tailor's goose.” XLVIII. “This, then, is evident,” he further mused, “That delectation does not come to those Who spend their strength in attributes abused, Or ripen into gorgeousness of clo'es; Neither to those with qualities unused, Who dawdle, to day's dying, in a doze; But unto those who try, by work or wit, The world's great family to benefit.” XLIX. In gentle recreation did he strive, Attending all the small fêtes that were going; Was great at fairs, where ladies so contrive To keep the cream of human kindness flowing; Tried summer picnics with their glee alive, That such a wealth of promises where showing; Joined social clubs and literary coteries, And took a stand high up 'mong Pleasure's votaries L. Thin dissipations, such as these, at best, Gave little recompense to his ambition; He seaward turned, and on the ocean's breast He thought he saw his ardent hope's fruition; He sang sea-songs, and “Heave ho'd” with the rest, But found the sea unsteady in position; He didn't relish his first evening's supper, And closed his “Heave ho's” in the leeward scupper. LI. He murmured faintly, “Please set me on shore; I love the grand and ever-restless ocean, But I believe that I can love it more On terra firma, where, unfelt its motion, I can delight to hear its mighty roar, And throw myself with rapturous devotion; But here, alas! the power that rules the sea Rules it too crookedly by far for me. LII. Then Dr. Spooner ventured into trade, And learned to buy and sell with ready art; He many paying operations made, And got the trick of traffic all by heart;— So shrewd was he in action he displayed, He won the fame of being “devilish smart,” Which means—well, anything respectable— But found that trade was far from the delectable. LIII. It would have done you good to hear him lie— Or froze your blood—just as you felt inclined; He'd swear that black was white a trade to tie, And all so plausible, that caution, blind, Took stock at once, without a how? or why? Such marvellous integrity to find; And then he slapped his pockets, well content That he had made a mighty big per cent. LIV. “Mercantile shrewdness,” though it fleece and skin, Is ne'er dishonest by the rules of trade, And those who deepest plunge and largest win Sleep lightest on the bargains they have made; Conscience to such makes no unpleasant din, And, at the future not one whit dismayed, They “will” their wealth with most complacent air, And lay them down the just's reward to share. LV. To Education then the doctor flew, The very field for happiness, he thought; The total that he guessed, and what he knew, Were into active requisition brought; He went to all Conventions with a gout That was a substitute for what he sought, And, being quite a favorite in the city, They made him member of the School Committee. LVI. Then pleasure turned to business—early, late, His door-bell rang with clamorous appeal, Permits to grant, parental doubts to bate, Teachers to hear, vexatious feuds to heal, New books to choose, the salaries to rate, The pangs of interrupted peace to feel, The public growling in its discontent, And watching, lynx-eyed, each invested cent. LVII. With not a chance to steal, and snubbed and bored, His privacy invaded as a right; His motives doubted and his claim ignored, His life a constant, ignominious fight; The slave of school-book agencies, that poured Their arguments so thick, that, vanquished quite, He vowed no more his soul with such to vex, Then “handed in” his thin official “cheeks.” LVIII. The doctor next dipped fiercely into morals, Went regularly every morn to prayer; Mixed earnestly in theologic quarrels, Where men for truth's sake pulled each other's hair; Had for all ill the formulaic abhorrals,— Two words, I think, you'll not find anywhere,— Struck for hair-splitting dogmas left and right, And deemed that he was “fighting the good fight.” LIX. He drew his skirts aside when others passed Of different belief from that he held; He fanned dissension with persistent blast, And with a Pharisaic rapture swelled; He'd gained perfection in belief at last, And, from his lofty perch, all else beheld In darkness lost—salvation's chances slim— But he was safe, and what were they to him? LX. Small delectation could he find herein, And worry of contention grayed his hair; He'd searched in every other one for sin, And looked within to find it rampant there; He'd thought through self-perfection bliss to win, But saw its fallacy in half-despair, And then backed out, not finding what he'd fain, Placing his baggage on some other train. LXI. He'd be a Mason: surely he could find Within those ancient halls the thing he sought; It seemed delightful to his ardent mind That happiness, like onions, could be bought; And so he acted as he felt inclined, And soon was to the ancient gridiron brought, Seeking for blissfulness one seldom sees, As lawyers get to heaven, by degrees. LXII. He spread himself on mystic pins and seals, And knew more signs than doth the Zodiac; Was letter-perfect in the springs and wheels Of night-trains running the mysterious track; Took every step the Order's scope reveals, Until, from the “ineffable” looking back, He wept, like what's his name, who lived of yore, Because he couldn't master something more. LXIII. Then Dr. Spooner took to rural shades, And dressed himself in most unique attire, A costume something like the knave of spades, As odd as piscator could e'er desire; And then he followed brooks through grassy glades To catch the trouts that epicures admire; But ne'er could he by any subtle crook Induce the fry to bite his baitless hook. LXIV. He sought dim nooks by water's babbling streams, He breathed the sweet “balm of a thousand flowers,” He laid him on the emerald sward for dreams, He hid himself within the woods' deep bowers, He revelled in the morning's opening beams, He dawdled through the sultry evening hours— Poisoned by dogwood, bit by bugs and flies, He fled from happiness 'neath rural skies. LXV. And then despairingly he made complaint: “O, who can tell me where is happiness? With much endeavor I am worn and faint, And each step seems to show the progress less In striving for that boon which hope did paint, Which seems more distant as my steps I press. Tell me, ye wise ones, in earth's mighty bound, Where, tell me where, may happiness be found?” LXVI. “Here stay your steps, my boy,” a veteran spoke; “I'm just the chap'll point you to the spot; I've sought for happiness through fire and smoke— My brierwood pipe—and here is where I've got: The search for happiness is but a joke, For which you needn't go all round the lot; I'll ease your caput of its great quandary— For delectation—see the dictionary.” LXVII. Then laughed aloud that execrable hind, While Dr. Spooner turned in strong disgust. But as he thought of it, he felt inclined To think the rough man's ribaldry was just; For to himself he said, “I nowhere find The delectation of my hope and trust But in the book; and therefore I will wait, And let things happen—as it pleases fate. LXVIII. And then he took things as they came about, Nor strove from fate his happiness to wring; At unpropititious luck he made no rout, But was serene as when joy's birds did sing, And in contentedness of purpose stout, He found himself as “happy as a king,”— Feeling true delectation did not rest On anything outside the seeker's breast. Note.—The author read the foregoing to a young and charming critic, who had just completed the ecstatic story of “The Bloody Hand, or the Avenger of Darrville;” and she immediately suggested that if Dr. Spooner had found some amiable being worthy of his choice—as in the instance of which she had just read,—he would undoubtedly have found the happiness he sought. It seemed to her that he had thrown away a great deal of valuable time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">NEW AND OLD DIPS FROM MY INKSTAND: LES MISERABLES. A LONG WAY AFTER VICTOR HUGO. Note.—The writer leaves the pronunciation of certain names to the reader's option; “he pays his money and he takes his choice.” I. JEAN VALJEAN. Jean Valjean A convict had been— For nineteen years no freedom had known. When from Toulon released, He was feared as a beast, And hooted and hounded from country to town. The fourth day, near To Pontarlier, The place of his destination, He was hungered and sore, But men shut their door, Nor pitied his desolation. Even the dogs their kennels refused To one so vile from bondage loosed, Till, by men and dogs alike abused, He grew savage with desperation. He swore to himself a bitter prayer, As he passed on through Cathedral Square, And shook his fist at the temple there, As though he thought the church might care; But it frowned in the dark with a frigid air, Nor heeded his demonstration. With failing strength He fell, at length, By a very strange fatality, At a printer's door, The whole world o'er The biding-place, on every shore, Of wisdom and morality. Not a single crumb had he to eat— He couldn't buy of bread or meat, For the shops were shut along the street, And he fain would sleep, In its silence deep, Forgetting his stinted rations; When a woman,—'tis always thus, I think, That, just as we're going to take a wink, And our eyelids peacefully 'gin to sink, The woman makes our tempers kink With sharp interrogations,— A woman saw his sorry plight, Asleep in the street on a stone by night, A singular couch for one not tight; So she spoke to him as a Christian might, And then he surlily told her That he was a soldier in distress— A claim that always its way must press; We every day its power confess, And do our best to aid and bless, And never turn cold shoulder. She heard and pitied the worthless scamp. He swore he hadn't a postage stamp, Had sought each door on a bootless tramp. She said he mustn't lie in the damp, A victim of Fortune's malice, But gave him two-pence, and bade him go To a house a block along or so, Next door to the Bishop's palace. Now the Bishop was of men the best, In whom the country round was blest; A model man, whose every thought With good of his fellow-men was fraught. His soul reflected the beaming love That streams direct from the throne above; His constant wish to do for others, And held the good and bad as brothers; He acted without regard of self— Gave up all thought of rank or pelf, And did his Master's duty; The poor and needy ones he fed, The languid and the erring led, The strong upon their way were sped, The hearts were soothed that joy had fled, And his tears upon the sorrowing shed Sprang up in shapes of beauty. With the insolent airs of a surly boor, The loafer opened the Bishop's door; I dare say left his mud on the floor, To the great disgust of Madame Magloire, Leaned on his stick the priest before, And told him all his story: Jean Valjean was the name he gave, For nineteen years a galley slave; The while he'd managed a trifle to save, Was able to pay for what he might crave, Wherein he seemed to glory. The Bishop turned to Madame Magloire, Who had placed for three at table before, And bade her provide for one guest more; At which Jean was astonished. He read to them his yellow pass, A record of fearful crime, alas! Of all he had done the world to harass— A hopeless case for prayer or mass; He asked for bread and a bed of grass, Nor longer hoped with men to class; But vain was the Bishop admonished. Without opening to Jean his head He bade Magloire put sheets on the bed In the alcove—then to the convict said, Sit down, sir, by the fire. The man, surprised and wild to hear A word of human love and cheer, Felt, as might be supposed, quite queer, And odd enough in his way did appear, But complied with the Bishop's desire. The table was set, And round it all met, Jean Valjean on the Bishop's right. The silver forks and spoons of state Were put in honor beside each plate, When the Bishop complained of the light. “The silver candlesticks!” he cried. 'Twas a matter with him of a little pride To have them lit with a guest by his side; And Madame Magloire, As she'd done before, Obeyed him she'd never in thought denied. 'Twas a goodly feast you may be bound; Magloire a bottle of wine had found, And care in a little while was drowned, And the convict was in a bother. Again he told the Bishop his name; But the Bishop said it was all the same, He felt his sorrow and his shame, He knew his title ere he came, And that he told him was “Brother.” Then Jean Valjean went to bed; But wicked thoughts spun through his head, The good, and pure, and holy instead. At midnight he arose from sleep, And round the house like a cat did creep, Doing such perfidious works— Stealing the spoons and stealing the forks, Then leaped the window and garden gate, And left the Bishop minus his plate! A wicked wretch, but such must be From taking felons and like to tea! So thought Madame Magloire And many more, But the Bishop smiled more glad than before. They had taken his forks, but he said 'twas as good To use spoons and forks that were made of wood. Jean Valjean was speedily caught And into the Bishop's presence brought By three gensdarmes—they had him, they thought; But the Bishop pretended he'd given the plate, And told him he needn't have leaped the gate, And wondered by what strange absence of mind He'd left his candlesticks behind. Jean Valjean here opened his eyes In a wild and undisguised surprise. Then the Bishop spoke. “My brother,” said he, “You're no more for evil, but good, you see. I've bought your soul of you, and withdraw It from the imp of perdition's claw, To lift it from the ills of the sod, And give it to the keeping of God.” A strange, strange trade, As ever was made; But, reader, if you'd find the key To open up this mystery, I'd say, do go To Lee and Shepard's, or where you please, And hire or borrow, and read at your ease, The book by Victor Hugo. II. FANTINE. Ne'er did monarch array his queen Richer than Hugo did Fantine, With pearls of gold More manifold Than she of Egypt wore of old— More regal than those of the “Queen of the South,” The gold on her head, the pearls in her mouth. O, she was fair as nymph or fay, And she was sweet as flowers in May, And she was as lithe as a breeze at play, And she was as mild as a summer day. She was all alone— No parents had known, A waif on the world for charity thrown; A sad, sad doom, For beauty and bloom— Immortal seed on a soil of stone; The fruit of love's unhallowed chrism, Denied the right of blest baptism, Left to shame and human blame, That follows the fallen like breath of flame, Called Fantine By herself—Fantine— Simply because it was her name. She knew none else; 'twas at her cast, Like a bone to a dog, by a beggar who passed— 'Twas Fantine only, first and last. And Fantine loved; Her heart was moved With a love more ardent than approved; But still it was a love as true, As e'er in human bosom grew, Fed by Hymen's sacred dew, And blest in sacerdotal view; For love is the same in poor and rich, Working them up to the self-same pitch, And don't distinguish “t'other from which.” She loved, with all her little powers —Hungry love that the heart devours— A man of wit and ready tin, But soiled by the world and touch of sin, With carious teeth and a wrinkled skin, And bad digestion—how could he win? His eyes were watery, too, and dim, But she saw no blemish at all in him: So true to him She flew to him, And stuck like Hilton's glue to him! But he, the churl, I'm sorry to say, Didn't love her in that same way. His was a passion—a baleful flame, That kindles in fervor and ends in shame; A blaze that burns with a lurid light, Then leaves a darkness, as black as night, Of broken heart and spirit blight; And poor Fantine, With anguish keen, Felt cold desertion's direst harms: Her first love flown— Alone—alone— Bearing her woe in heart—and arms. In heaven above or earth below A purer love none e'er may know, Than in the mother's breast doth glow; Irrespective of sin or shame, Glorying still in the mother's name, Nature asserting its holy claim, In fortune's light, In poverty's blight, In sorrow's night, It burns forever and burns the same; And sweet Fantine Loved her poor wean As 'twere a child of loftier fame. On a dusty day O'er a public way Was Fantine and her child astray, Weary and sad, and most forlorn, Bound for the town where she was born, Hoping an honest living to win, Outside the vortex of deadly sin, When she arrived at a wayside inn. 'Twas a queer, old nook, With forbidding look; But there before it, in a swing, Two children, bright as flowers in spring, Rocked to and fro, While, soft and low, The mother a gentle air did sing; And Fantine felt Her motherly heart within her melt, As she looked upon the beautiful thing. The mothers, with a motherly pride, Put their children side by side, And poor Fantine, As she viewed the scene, Thought of her fatherless babe, and cried. “What will Mrs. Grundy say?” She said to herself, in a tearful way; For she dreaded the folk of M. sur M., And dreaded the lies she must tell to them. So she gave up all of her little hoard, And a promise of more than she could afford, In payment for the baby's board; Then with a heart of grief and pain, And falling tears, like summer rain, With empty pocket and giddy brain, She wandered forth on her walk again, Leaving her babe, without a fear, With Mr. and Mrs. Thernardier, By prudent folk considered queer, Because Fantine Must surely have seen They didn't respectable appear. M. Madeleine Had made great gain By a patent he had chanced obtain; Godsend to those of M. sur M., An El Dorado 'twas to them. The little place Grew up apace, Under his grave and watchful care, And industry grew, And virtue, too, And Fantine found employment there. Her toil beguiled By thought of her child, That there in the distance lived and smiled. But she kept her story within her breast, And none her weighty secret guessed. But gossips were round,— They always abound, Like canker worms, to curse the ground, As clearly, in a moral way, As the worms the farmer's hope to-day, Filling his heart with dire dismay,— Gossips who saw her proper life, Who knew not were she maid or wife, And whispered this and whispered that, In hours of sly, malicious chat, Until, alas for poor Fantine! One came among them—her child had seen! And then the rout, The virtuous shout, To think that she had been found out! Then were the arrows of hatred hurled, And poor Fantine was thrown on the world. Alas for her, Sweet sufferer! No friends to call on, far or near; And how could she pay Thernardier? He was pressing her for his pay, Said the child was pining away, Driving her crazed with fears each day; Besides, her landlord wanted his rent, But she had expended her last red cent; Had even sold The precious gold That covered her head to raise the dimes, And the bright pearls, too, In her mouth that grew, But not at premium of later times. Dante mentions the rapid pace, And the easy trip to a certain place, When mortals fall from a state of grace; 'Twas certainly thus in Fantine's case. It makes the heart of the virtuous bleed The record of her shame to read— Till she fell in the hands of the hard Javert, And was brought before his honor the mayor, Whose face she spat in then and there! But no angry glow Did his honor show, Who told Javert to let her go. Then she, astounded, heard him tell That he was one who wished her well; Hadn't known she had left his mill; That 'twas others who had dealt her ill; Then had her conveyed, For hospital aid, Where the Sisters their heavenly mission fill, Promising bliss in store for her yet In union sweet with her little Cosette. Sad, ah, sad was the closing scene Of the little life of poor Fantine. Crushed, and broken, and poor, and ill, She saw her measure of sorrow fill; Her hope deferred, till her wasted breath Became as one with the airs of death, Then sunk to rest, and never met The fond embrace of her dear Cosette. Her last shocked gaze, with her closing gasp, Showing Jean Valjean, Her Madeleine, Held like a vise in Javert's grasp. A NEW RAPE OF THE LOCK. PART I. Sweet Madaline's hair was very fair, Of ashen-gold hue, by which bards swear, Whose glorious curls Were the envy of girls— Of kink divine and profusion rare; And Madaline's power, Evinced each hour, Rested, like Samson's, in her hair. In such a glory it round her lay! Crinkled in Style's adroitest way, Burnt with irons to make it stay, —With amount of effort best not to say— Its every curl, in the light astray, Seeming a streak from the source of day, Leading the rapt beholder, Who saw it about her neck at play, To deem it some amorous sunbeam's ray, Lit on her snow-white shoulder. Not like the curls we sometimes meet Out there upon the public street, To good taste oft offences, That glisten and twist admiration to gain, And excite the susceptible masculine train, Till they find at last, to their shame and pain, That they're fraud, and the whole of their object, plain— Getting goods under false pretences. At every feast, or dance, or fair, In the burning blaze of the gas-light's glare, Were seen those locks flash here and there, Like fireflies in the summer air, Enchanting by their glitter; Sought for by eligible beaux, Subject for rivalry with those Who ached to tweak each other's nose In the eager race to get her. And her smile was bright as the curls she wore, And equal kindness on all she'd pour, And each fond swain Perplexed his brain So far as that organ might obtain, As he watched the smile her features o'er, If for him it any promise bore; But all his watch was vain. PART II. 'Twas in the glow of a festal night, The social fires all burning bright, The gas turned on to its utmost height, Bathing the scene in its fullest light; Sweet Madaline, The pride of the scene, The cynosure of enraptured sight To many a would-be lover, Sat at the board with her golden hair In affluent ringlets about her chair, Catching the whole of the gas-light's glare That streamed from the jet above her. Toasted, and flattered, and praised, and pressed, She caught each word with a fluttering breast; And many a youthful, manly vest Swelled at her beauty manifest, And pulsing hearts, 'neath the glowing test, The potency of her charms confessed, With rapturous feeling overblessed If her eyes in kindness wandered; And her golden hair a wealth possessed That bosoms filled with as keen unrest As any awaked by the golden west, In auriferous dreams long pondered. Around her chair Her votaries there Hung entranced her joy to share In each luxurious minute; Already had passed the season of cream, And trifles sweet as a maiden's dream, And small talk ran like a babbling stream, When, a moment's hush, A push and a rush, And then there came a mellifluous scream, Like the angry note of a linnet! No one could tell the reason why, But 'twas Madaline's cry, and Madaline's eye That looked around on the standers-by With the fiercest temper in it! PART III. “On with the dance!” and with agile feet, The music breathing its cadence sweet, The dancers flitted with measure meet, The gay hours moving on pinions fleet, With saltatory joy replete, And Madaline, Again serene, Moved in the throng the regnant queen, The blissful scene enhancing; There were polks and waltzes, galops and reels, And those rare movements the dancer feels, Thrilling all through from head to heels, That make the acme of dancing. Again, “Choose partners!” every set In just accordancy has met For the gracefulest, grandest trial yet; There are twists and twirls, And swirls and whirls, And glowing bright are Madaline's curls On the happy shoulder of George Manett! (Perhaps that wasn't the very name, But the truth of the tale is just the same.) About they go in the mazy dance— Chassez! Balancez! Back! Advance! When, just at the critical turning, Fair Madaline seemed struck with a trance; Her feet stood still, and with look askance, Astonishment in her countenance, Her eyes in their sockets burning! The dancers stopped in sore dismay; The caller's call none would obey; And there they stood in the light's full ray, Looking with vacant stare, Till Madaline her finger put on Her wondering partner's third vest-button, Where, gleaming like gold, On his waistcoat's fold Was a lock of golden hair! Like the fierce wild red man of the west, Swinging a scalp as his valor's test, So Manett wore on his sturdy breast A lock of hers he loved the best, And he vowed a vow that none of the rest Should lift a hand to pick it; Though how it came there he didn't know, But Madaline the spot could show, Where late the golden curl did grow, That was torn by its roots from its soil of snow, In the midst of the golden thicket. And that was the secret of Madaline's scream, Mingled with noise of spoons in the cream, And waking the “spoons” from their little dream, Coupled with glance of her eyes' fierce gleam, That carried such a start with it; And Manett clings to his beautiful scalp As firm as the foot of an amorous Alp, Determined never to part with it; And Madaline she Don't disagree, Seeing he has his heart with it. BUILDING THE BRIDGE. A TRUTHFUL STORY OF OLD PEMIGEWASSET. Out spake the Plymouth landlord: “A bridge we'll straightway throw Across Pemigewasset's tide To where the wild flowers blow.” Then out spake stout Seth Brownleaf, Conductor on the road: “'Twere worth a deal to all that here Mayhap shall find abode; And how can one do better Than herein show his skill, For the credit of his genius And the power of his will? “So down the bridge goes, landlord, With all the speed it may; I, with two more to help me, Will build it in a day. O'er that bright stream a pathway May well be built by three; Now who will stand on either hand And build the bridge with me?” Then out spake Jotham Hornbeam— A rum'un rough was he: “Lo, I will stand with axe in hand, And build the bridge with thee.” And out spake strong Jo Chesman— A granite boy was he: “I will abide with boards supplied, And build the bridge with thee.” “Seth Brownleaf,” said the landlord, “As thou sayest so let it be.” And straightway went on their intent Those sturdy builders three; For such men in such spirit Were bound a bridge to throw, That son, and wife, in limb and life, Might safely over go. The three stood calm and silent, And looked upon the tide, Then planted first a joiner's bench That lay the stream beside; And soon the boarders, looking on, Felt their hearts thrill to see The joiner's bench and an old board fence A path for the dauntless three. The axe and hammer sounded, As manfully they plied, And the bridge stretched out behind them In its majesty and pride. “Come back! come back! bold Brownleaf,” Cried the boarders with a burst; “On, Hornbeam! on, Jo Chesman! And we will quench your thirst.” On labored Jotham Hornbeam, Jo Chesman pushed ahead; The hammers rattled merrily, The work triumphant sped; And when they turned their faces Towards the thither land, They saw brave Brownleaf coming back With a stone jug in his hand. Then, with a shout like thunder, They laid the last cross-beam, And their voices echoed merrily O'er Pemigewasset's stream; And a loud shout of triumph Rose from the other side, As finished was the mighty bridge Across the rushing tide. Alone stood brave Seth Brownleaf, For the others had gone in, And the way they bagged those fluids Was what men term “a sin.” “He's done it!” cried Si. Winkley, As he took another chaw; “'Twill squash!” said old Lishe Porcina, Bringing down his dexter paw. Round turned his broad face glowing; His mates were overcome; Nor spoke a word did he to them, But looked towards his home; He saw the hotel beaming fair— The boarders in a row— And he spoke to the noble river That at his feet did flow:— “Father Pemigewasset! Look at this bridge, I pray. Its joiner's bench, its boards and nails, Take them in charge this day.” So he spoke, and gathered up the tools, His handsaw by his side, And then upon the bridge he'd made He crossed the humbled tide. And now the shore he reaches, Now on the bank he stands, Now round him throng the boarders, Who shake his muddy hands; But when, three weeks thereafter, The fresh came down apace, Away went the bridge like a cobweb chain, And left not a single trace. Yet Hornbeam and Jo Chesman Both swear, by main and might, That they were sober as a judge, And only Seth was tight; And say the bridge would e'er have stood Through all the tides and gales, If the whiskey hadn't somehow got Spilt over 'mongst the nails. Note.—The foregoing incident in Roman history will be remembered by some of the older sojourners at the Pemigewasset House, in Plymouth, New Hampshire. Seth's bridge was regarded a fine specimen of engineering, though he was not an engineer; simply a conductor. It is supposed that it was from this incident that Macaulay, conceived his idea of the “Keeping of the Bridge” by Horatius and others, which he subsequently put in feeble verse. GRAPE-SKINS. I saw a man of portly estate Walking the street with regal gait; Just the man that the eye well suits, Proper and nice from hat to boots. So perfect his coat, so neat his vest, An exquisite taste was manifest, And every one who chose to scan Could only say, “What a tasteful man!” Alas for the glory of human pride, As frail and fickle as the tide! For the polish of blacking and brush and oil One little spatter of mud may spoil. E'en as he walked the pave along, With head exalted and footstep strong, He trod on a grape-skin in his way, And a man disgraced in the dirt he lay! This moral I drew from what I saw: There are men in the world without a flaw, Who are in such robes of sanctity found, And such rare virtues engirt them round, That we humble ourselves, as we pass them by, With reverent and admiring eye, Saying, while viewing such merits rare, “Bless us, what good men they are!” But alas for the glory of human pride, As frail and fickle as the tide! In the world of men they exalt their horn, As though of a better clay they were born. But there in their path the grape-skins wait, —Temptations hidden perhaps till late— One step of the foot—one curvetting lurch, And down they come from their eminent perch. In dress or morals 'tis much the same; And happy is he who wins his fame, If he die at its zenith, nor has to wait Till he slip and fall through invidious fate. He may dodge the rock and shy the cloud That threat his step and bearing proud, But let him not crow till danger's past— He may by a grape-skin be overcast. MY FRIEND'S SECRET. I found my friend in his easy chair, With his heart and his head undisturbed by a care; The smoke of a Cuba outpoured from his lips, His face like the moon in a semi-eclipse; His feet, in slippers, as high as his nose, And his chair tilted back to a classical pose. I marvelled much such contentment to see— The secret whereof I begged he'd give me. He puffed away with reanimate zest, As though with an added jollity blest. “I'll tell you, my friend,” said he, in a pause, “What is the very ‘dientical’ cause. “Don't fret!—Let this be the first rule of your life;— Don't fret with your children, don't fret with your wife; Let everything happen as happen it may, Be cool as a cucumber every day; If favorite of fortune or a thing of its spite, Keep calm, and believe that all is just right. “If you're blown up abroad or scolded at home, Just make up your mind to let it all come; If people revile you or pile on offence, 'T will not make any odds a century hence. For all the reviling that malice can fling, A little philosophy softens the sting. “Run never in debt, but pay as you go; A man free from debt feels a heaven below; He rests in a sunshine undimmed by a dun, And ranks 'mid the favored as A No. 1. It needs a great effort the spirit to brace 'Gainst the terror that dwells in a creditor's face. “And this one resolve you should cherish like gold, —It has ever my life and endeavor controlled,— If fortune assail, and worst comes to worst, And business proves bad, its bubbles all burst, Be resolved, if disaster your plans circumvent, That you will, if you fail, owe no man a cent.” There was Bunsby's deep wisdom revealed in his tone, Though its depth was hard to fathom I own; “For how can I fail,” I said to myself, “If to pay all my debts I have enough pelf?” Then I scratched my sinciput, battling for light, But gave up the effort, supposing 'twas right; And herein give out, as my earnest intent, Whenever I fail to owe no man a cent. GOUT: A SUBDUED CASE. Dear Nannie, place my easy chair, And give my foot the proper square— Be careful how you touch it!—THERE!— That pang, just past, Might cause an anchorite to swear, Nor risk his caste. And now my pen with acrid-sting And ink of verjuice hither bring, That I may Gout's demerits sing In limpéd strains; A theme ignored—a baleful thing— It prompts my pains. My muse is no ecstatic sprite, To lead me, wildered, out of sight, And breathe ineffable delight In bird-like lays; Than this I try no higher flight To win my baize. But how describe the pain and ache— The surging, burning, shooting shake; The wrench, the rend, the twist, the break, The anguish deep, The while dire demons hold a wake To murder sleep! Milton has writ of Purgatory, And Pollok a more lurid story, And Dante raised h?eat con amore, But mine the worse, Compared with which their highest glory 'S not worth a curse. But hold! my pet canary there Sings from his perch a gentle air, Regarding me with tender care— In fear, 'twould seem, His looks might fall on me somewhere, To make me scream. Entranced I listen—pen suspent— To him strange fascination lent, And his sweet song, the air besprent, Thus seems to say— The while from me his eye intent Turns not away:— “You surely make a great to-do About this thing that troubles you, All selfishly forgetting, too, The pain you make; Be just a bit to reason true, For manhood's sake. “And don't you see, my muddled friend, Great good from great ill may descend? And anguish, that the heart doth rend, May give a birth, Of grandest offices the end, And priceless worth? “So this same gout that you revile, Though painful, doubtless, for a while, May prove at last the creaming oil —The thought is valid— That makes antagonisms smile In life's great salad. “But for this gout would you have known The myriad favors to you shown— The kindly hearts to you have flown, Attentions dear, The atmosphere of love outthrown To give you cheer? “How friends have pressed, with smiling lips, Freighted with fruits, like orient ships, To lighten up your joy's eclipse, While here you groan; And, from electric finger-tips, Hope's seeds have sown! “What gives that crutch its magic power To call more spirits than Glendower? You'd hammer like a thunder shower, I greatly fear, Did sympathy not ope a door Through which to hear. “A most ungrateful churl, at best, You will nor reason manifest; Inside's a demon more a pest Than this without; Disturbance of the spirit's rest Is worse than gout. “Then stop complaint, and be a man; Be true, and your tormentor scan, And ask, May it not be a plan Your faults to snub? Perhaps in them it all began, And there's the rub.” The song here ceased. I dipped my pen, But all the spite had left me then, And simply shouting out, “Amen!” I gave it o'er; Sure ne'er a bird to mortal ken Sang so before. THE OLD RED EAR. Thou 'mind'st me of the festal night When, though the stars were shut from sight, The fleet hours winged with footsteps light, To pleasure's note, And mirth and song put care to flight To realms remote. Ah, sweet the picture thou dost bring! Reseated in that magic ring, We round the circle deftly swing, As then we swung; While every way the husks we fling The crowd among. And merry joke and repartee Dart to and fro with noisy glee, And speech unloosed finds accent free From mirthful lips, As sweet as roses that the bee Delighted sips. Dim is the lantern's dusky glow Upon the cereal heaps below, But bright the wit in ceaseless flow, And bright the gleam Of eyes, above the gloom that throw A brighter beam. The old grow young again to mark The sounds that shatter in the dark, Where boys and girls in playful lark Their bent attain, And fun, like an electric spark, Smacks out amain. Ah, crimson ear! thou ledd'st me through A scene I'd fain again renew, That e'en to ponder in review, By memory's beam, Enchants me till I sadden to Dispel the dream. What precious rights didst thou impart! How soon I learned them all by heart! How did my pulse in tumult start, As thou, revealed, Didst prove a key, whose dexterous art Rare sweets unsealed! Ah, every kernel is a tongue That speaks me back those scenes among; Through Time's back door, wide open swung, A sight I see, Of flowers of joy, at random flung, No more for me. But such is doom, and such is best; And older hearts should seek for rest, Nor in such fancy stocks invest As husking bouts; They are for youth, 'tis manifest— The elders “outs.” BLESS YOU! There is a prayer of simple art, That from the tongue the readiest slips, That springs spontaneous from the heart, And breaks in blessing on the lips: Bless you! When joy's bright beam about us rests, As some dear hand our cup o'erfills, In this our gladness manifests, And with love's fondest cadence thrills: Bless you! The sympathy with others' woe That melts the heart to loving tears, No sweeter form of speech may know Than this the sorrowing spirit hears: Bless you! When weary limb and aching brain Attest the weight of busy care, How lifts the dulling cloud of pain To catch the accent of that prayer: Bless you! In love's pure sacrament of bliss, When lip meets lip in fond embrace, Rises with blest approval this To give the chrism a holier grace: Bless you! As failing pulse and dimming eye Proclaim some loved one's exit near, How like a whisper from on high Comes the faint murmur to our ear: Bless you! But yet no language it may need; A glance, as well as words, may pray; All speech kind action may exceed, A smile a deeper sense convey: Bless you! O, may our hearts be tuned aright, Unselfishly this prayer to feel, And fill our measure of delight By supplicating others' weal: Bless you! THE POOR BLIND MAN. A poor blind man besought my aid, Feeling his way with a crooked stick, Stepping as if of the earth afraid, And touching the pave with pensive lick. I held a penny before his eyes; He could see no more than a dead man can, And I felt my pity within me rise, For such a very unfortunate man. I took his hand and led him o'er The crossing where the mud was deep, And guided his steps where a bit before An Irishman had tried to sweep. He thanked me kindly, with rayless eye, And a tearful tone of cadence sweet; Just then a dog, that was going by, Smelt him to know were he good to eat. I could but mark the blind man's look As the canine smelt his brogans thick; And I marked the capital aim he took As he gave that canine a damaging kick. Then the blind man chuckled in merry mood, As the dog yelped out his agony; But how he knew where the canine stood Was more than I, with both eyes, could see. Just then came along a street horse-ear, And the blind man hailed it, and off he rolled, And I felt it on my consciousness jar, That I had been infernally sold. HOME IN VACATION. How still the house is! All the noise and riot, That late our ears with fearful din distracted, Are now submerged in overwhelming quiet, And order reigns where chaos was enacted. Ah, blessed order! we thy peace enjoying, Forget the recent source of our vexation, And while the tranquil time we are employing, We bless the happy season of vacation. No voices by the chamber stairs are calling; No lawless hands on the piano drumming; No teasing Ike his sisterhood is hauling; No screams for “Father!” to his ear are coming; No boisterous lungs in disputatious fretting; No tart remark, no sharp recrimination; No little rebel duty's claim forgetting; No broken rules for stern examination. The books are on the shelves in nice condition, The music piled up in the proper places, The table-cloths are in exact position, And just the angle are the shells and vases. It is so quite! Not an echo hearing In all the rooms, from basement to the attic. We smile to realize the comfort cheering Of stillness so profound—bliss so ecstatic. But yet, amid the turbulence and clatter, There mingled strains that filled the heart with pleasure, Kernels of love mixed with the idle chatter, Bright grains among the dross we loved to treasure. Glad glances met our own each day returning, And faces with the soul's young sunlight glowing, And hearts with warm, impulsive fervor burning, Spoke out from lips with youth's own language flowing. Sweet melodies upon the air of even Woke the heart's tenderness to fondest dreaming, And lost in notes that seemed like those of heaven, Forgot were cares with which the earth is teeming. Although we prize the luxury of order, And think ourselves enriched the boon possessing, The ripless calm that overhangs our border, Purchased with loss of these is not a blessing. We sigh regretfully the past recalling, And crave disorder with the joys attending, For quiet wears to us a garb appalling, And peace thus gained is not worth the defending. Then welcome once again the wild commotion, The song, the shout, the dance, the roguish actions, Breaking to life the dull domestic ocean, By order's oft allowable infractions. VAIN REGRETS. A seedy old beggar asked alms of me As he sat 'neath the shade of a wayside tree. He was beggared in purse and beggared in soul, And his voice betrayed a pitiful dole, As he sang a song, to a dismal pitch, With the burden, “If THINGS WAS ONLY SICH!” “If things was only sich,” said he, “You should see what a wonderful man I'd be; No beggar I, by the wayside thrown, But I'd live in a palace and millions own, And men would court me if I were rich— As I'd be if things was only sich.” “If things was only sich,” said he, “I'd be lord of the land and lord of the sea; I would have a throne and be a king, And rule the roast with a mighty swing— I'd make a place in Fame's bright niche; I'd do it if things was only sich.” “If things was only sich,” said he, “Rare wines I'd quaff from the far countree, I'd clothe myself in dazzling garb, I'd mount the back of the costly barb, And none should ask me wherefore or which— Did it chance that things was only sich.” “If things was only sich,” said he, “I'd love the fairest and they'd love me; Yon dame, with a smile that warms my heart, Might have borne with me life's better part, But lost to me, here in poverty's ditch, What were mine if things was only sich.” Thus the old beggar moodily sung, And his eyes dropped tears as his hands he wrung. I could but pity to hear him berate, In dolorous tones, the decrees of Fate, That laid on his back its iron switch, While he cried, “If things was only sich.” “If things was only sich!”—e'en all Might the past in sad review recall; But little the use and little the gain, Exhuming the bones of buried pain, And whether we're poor or whether we're rich, We'll say not, “If things was only sich.” TRUE FAITH. Old Reuben Fisher, who lived in the lane, Was never in life disposed to complain; If the weather proved fair, he'd thank God for the sun, And if it were rainy, with him 'twas all one;— “I have just the weather I fancy,” said he, “For what pleases God always satisfies me.” If trouble assailed, his brow was ne'er dark, And his eye never lost its happiest spark. “'Twill not better fix it to gloom or to sigh; To make the best of it I always shall try! So, Care, do your worst,” said Reuben with glee, “And which of us conquers, we shall see, we shall see.” If his children were wild, as children will prove, His temper ne'er lost its warm aspect of love; “My dear wife,” he'd say, “don't worry nor fret; 'Twill all be right with the wayward ones yet; 'Tis the folly of youth, that must have its way; They'll penitent turn from their evil some day.” If a name were assailed, he would cheerily say, “Well, well; we'll not join in the cry, any way; There are always two sides to every tale— And the true one at last is sure to prevail. There is an old rule that I learned when a lad,— ‘Deem every one good till he's proved to be bad.’” And when in the meshes of sin tightly bound, The reckless and luckless mortal was found, Proscribed by every woman and man, And put under rigid and merciless ban, Old Reuben would say, with sympathy fraught, “We none of us do half as well as we ought.” If friends waxed cold, he'd say with a smile— “Well, if they must go, Heaven bless them the while; We walked a sweet path till the crossing ways met, And though we have parted, I'll cherish them yet; They'll go by their way and I'll go by mine— Perhaps in the city ahead we shall join.” There were sickness and death at last in his cot, But still Reuben Fisher in sorrow blenched not: “'Tis the Father afflicts; let Him do what He will; What comes from His hand can mean us no ill; I cheerfully give back the blessing He lent, And through faith in the future find present content.” Then he lay on his death-bed at last undismayed; No terror had death at which he was afraid; “Living or dying, 'tis all well with me, For God's will is my will,” submissive said he. And so Reuben died, with his breast full of grace, That beamed in a smile on his time-furrowed face. A COUNTRY RAINY DAY. Up from the river Piscataqua, at Newington. sweeps the rain, Over the field and over the wood, And the fretful wind, with a note of pain, Sobs and murmurs a sad refrain, Responsive to the angry flood. O, the sight for impatient eyes, Scanning the desolate, dreary day, With its drenchéd earth and leaden skies, To see the misty clouds arise That shroud the hills there far away. I hear the plashing torrent pour, And listen with a sense of dread; There's bodily misery in the roar, That wakens mental torture sore, Till all of sweet content has fled. Drip and drip from yonder eaves— The whole day long 'tis dripping there! There's a shivering sound in all the leaves, And the feeling the wakeful soul receives Is one akin to deep despair. The poultry in the barn-yard stand, Damp and cheerless, with drooping quills; They see no promise in all the land, Or joy that they can understand Through this grand culminate of ills. That crower never will crow again, That hen never exalt her lay; Their ardor is damped by the falling rain, And they seem to feel, it is very plain, Disgusted with the sloppy day. The swallows seek the sheltered place, High up there on the beams of the barn And “touch and go” they flit their race, Showing their young, with tender grace, The useful lesson they must “larn.” The cattle on the barn-floor smoke, —A practice they are here allowed— While all the boys, unhindered, joke, And “Uncle George” A true country philosopher, who, when the skies are the blackest, always predicts that it is “coming off.” puts in his spoke, The jolliest among the crowd. He cares not though the day be wet; “What is the use,” he says, “to cry? 'Twill be fair weather, some time, yet— 'Tis not a bit of use to fret, Let the weather be wet or dry.” The croakers indoors sadly growl At hopes thus gloomily overeast; The answering wind sets up a howl, And the rain comes down like a water-fowl, Struck by the north-east chilling blast. I hear the struggling of the spout, As it outpours its yeasty flood; I hear the hay-press workers shout, And see Hodge driving the cattle out Through pools of liquefying mud. O Patience! what a virtue thou! I feel thy need in all my bones; John Bunyan yonder in the slough Was no worse off than I am now, Hearing these angry tempest tones. Roar out, ye children on the stair, And let your voices do their best; We'll make believe the day is fair, And try to mitigate despair, Though all our trying prove a jest. Alas! alas! 'tis even so; We cannot banish this one pain; The frisky winds must have their blow, And all the racks must overflow, That hold the bottles of the rain. SIDEWALK OPERA. It is wonderful how infectious opera is. Whole neighborhoods will be bewitched by it; and men and women, in pursuing the quiet avocations of life, will become operatic in spite of themselves. Men ask the price of a beefsteak with a bravura, which is replied to by a cavatina; the morning salutation becomes a duet, and arias and romanzas are common things. Thus an opera of householders, compelled to shovel off in front after a snow-storm, was quite amusing. Scene, Sidewalk. Snow mountains high. Smith, Brown, Jones, and Robinson (queerly costumed, armed with shovels, prepared to level the drift). Quartette. Here we are to stand the brunt: We must shovel off in front. Now with blades to cleave the snow, In we go, and in we go, Throwing the invading drift Far as human nerve can lift. In, boys, in, and do not stay; It will be as good as play. [They pitch in. Smith (resting on his shovel). Whew! 'tis rough and tough enough: I'm not made of seasoned stuff. I can't stand this fierce employ: I'll knock off, and find a boy. Brown, Jones, and Robinson (resting on their shovels). Trio. Ah! peccavi do you cry? So soon from the toil to fly? Can you thus the joy forego Of this fresh and healthy glow? Stay: think better of it, Smith, Be a man of nerve and pith. Smith (shouldering his shovel, and beckoning to a boy about forty years old). Bass. My hope to feel the glow is dim; Therefore I resign to him. [Exit. [Brown, Jones, and Robinson resume shovelling.] Brown (resting on his shovel, and wiping his face). By George! this'll try the back: I thought I felt a muscle crack; And, though I feel all right and brisk, I don't dare too much to risk. Therefore I conceive it best To call a boy to do the rest. Jones and Robinson (resting on their shovels). Duet. Ha, ha! thus the toil you shirk, While we stick and do the work. Men of pluck, we'll trophies show Of our struggle with the snow. Brown (shouldering his shovel, and calling another boy of some fifty summers and forty-nine winters). 2d Bass. I will leave you all the fun Of hope achieved and victory won. [Exit. [Jones and Robinson resume shovelling.] Jones (resting on his shovel, and putting his hand wildly to his head). Ah! that horrid vertigo! I was fearful 'twould be so. Round and round things seem to spin: I declare I must cave in. Robinson (resting on his shovel). Solo. Thus they drop from out the ring, Tender as the buds of spring; Leaving me here all alone To shovel on, while they have flown. Jones (shouldering his shovel, and calling a boy of about thirty-five years). Tenor. 'Tis rather “going back,” I know; But vertigo now makes me go. [Exit. [Robinson resumes shovelling.] Robinson (resting on his shovel, and looking at about twenty feet of drift he has got to work through). Faith, I think I'd best give o'er: My dexter hand is very sore, My hair and eyes are full of snow,— I guess I'll have the verti-go. Robinson (shouldering his shovel, and calling a boy about twenty-five). 2d Tenor. Here, my lad: just put this through; I'll leave the glory all to you. [Exit. Quartette by Pat, Phelim, Terence, and Mick, with shovel accompaniment. Ah, begorra! but this is a good job for us, onnyhow: Blessings on the shnow-storrum that kicked up sich a lovely row! With the worruk half done by the gintlefolk, who broke down 'fore they did it, Laving us to charge what we're a mind to, by the same token; and we'll do that, you'd better belave, before we've done wid it. [They shovel. SAN GAREE'S RIDE. I'll tell you a tale, if you'll list to me, Of the ride that was rid by San Garee, On a night in the K. N. Fifty-Five: There are many witnesses alive Who were on the spot the thing to see. He said to his friend, “The constable's come, But, as you'll see, I'm up to trap; They think they've wholly stopped our rum By cutting off the tavern's tap. I'll show 'em a trick worth two of that, For I'll away to the opposite flat, Ready to ride to Medford town And bring the real ‘critter’ down, In spite of the tyrannous Maine law's frown!” Then he said good night, and a jug he took, And crossed the bridge that spanned the brook, Just as the moon, half over the bay, Shed its beam where a hay-cart waiting lay— A phantom cart, with slats upright, Through which the moon shone still and bright, And a huge black hulk of a shadow was cast On the fence, as San Garee hurried past. A clatter of hoofs rang through the town, Lickity-cut, at a terrible pace, And the oldest stagers in the place Vowed that such riding they'd never known: That was all! and yet from his mission that night, A dozen men ere morning were tight! It was ten by the village clock When he crossed the bridge into Medford town. He smelt the fragrance of the dock, And heard the hum of the 'stillery dam, And the sound of a distant front door slam, As folks to their naps were settling down; And he was fast asleep in his bed, The one on whom San Garee did call, Who filled his jug with the fluid red, And didn't mind the law at all. The rest is soon told. He came as he went, With no policeman on the scent, His prize securely lashed to his side, That ere he started he twice had tried, Dashing along through road and lane With eager heart and urgent rein; And under the trees, by the river's brink, Stopping only to take a drink! So on that night rode San Garee, And so through the night his horses' heels To wakeful ears made noisy appeals,— Appeals that mocked curiosity;— A clatter in darkness that passed by the door, As homeward his trophy the night rider bore! Now, 'mong the rummest things that are past, Recounted often in circles fast, In hours of sport, and mirth, and fun, They tell the story with shouts of glee, How the Maine-law people were done By the midnight ride of San Garee. THE GREEN GOOSE. Mr. Bogardus “gin a treat,” And a green goose, best of birds to eat, Delicious, savory, fat, and sweet, Formed the dish the guests to greet; But such, we know, Is small for a “blow,” And many times around won't go; So Mr. Bogardus chanced to reflect, And with a wisdom circumspect, He sent round cards to parties select, Some six or so the goose to dissect, The day and hour defining; And then he laid in lots of things, That might have served as food for kings, Liquors drawn from their primal springs, And all that grateful comfort brings To epicures in dining. But Mr. Bogardus's brother Sim, With moral qualities rather dim, Copied the message sent to him, In his most clerkly writing, And sent it round to Tom, and Dick, And Harry, and Jack, and Frank, and Nick, And many more, to the green goose “pick” Most earnestly inviting; He laid it on the green goose thick, Their appetites exciting. 'Twas dinner time by the Old South clock; Bogardus waited the sounding knock Of friends to come at the moment, “chock,” To try his goose, his game, his hock, And hoped they would not dally; When one, and two, and three, and four, And running up the scale to a score, And adding to it many more, Who all their Sunday fixings wore, Came in procession to the door, And crowded in on his parlor floor, Filling him with confusion sore, Like an after-election rally! “Gentlemen,” then murmured he, “To what unhoped contingency Am I owing for this felicity, A visit thus unexpected?“ Then they held their cards before his eyes, And he saw, to his infinite surprise, That some sad dog had taken a rise On him, and his hungry friends likewise, And whom he half suspected; But there was Sim, Of morals dim, With a face as long, and dull, and grim, As though he the ire reflected. Then forth the big procession went, With mirth and anger equally blent; To think they didn't get the scent Of what the cursed missive meant Annoyed some of 'em deeply; They felt they'd been caught by a green goose bait, And plucked and skinned, and then, light weight, Had been sold very cheaply. MORAL. Keep your weather eye peeled for trap, For we never know just what may hap, Nor if we shall be winners; Remembering that one green goose Will be of very little use 'Mongst twenty hungry sinners. MIGRATORY BONES, Dr. Redman, of New York, was a noted medium, and it was said that, for a while, wherever he might be, bones would be dropped all about him, to the confusion and wonder of everybody. These bones, he said, were brought him by a spirit, whose bones were of no further use to him. SHOWING THE VAGABONDISH TENDENCY OF BONES THAT ARE LOOSE. We all have heard of Dr. Redman, The man in New York who deals with dead men, Who sits at a table, And straighway is able To talk with the spirits of those who have fled, man! And gentles and ladies Located in Hades, Through his miraculous mediation, Declare how they feel, And such things reveal As suits their genius for impartation. 'Tis not with any irreverent spirit I give the tale, or flout it, or jeer it; For many good folk Not subject to joke Declare for the fact that they both see and hear it. It comes from New York, though, And it might be hard work, though, To bring belief to any point near it. Now this Dr. Redman, Who deals with the dead men, Once cut up a fellow whose spirit had fled, man, Who (the fellow) perchance Had indulged in that dance Performed at the end of a hempen thread, man; And the cut-up one, (A son of a gun!) Like Banquo, though he was dead, wasn't done, Insisted in very positive tones That he'd be ground to calcined manure, Or any other evil endure, Before he'd give up his right to his bones! And then, through knocks, the resolute dead man Gave his bones a bequest to Redman. In Hartford, Conn., This matter was done, And Redman the bones highly thought on, When, changed to New York Was the scene of his work, In conjunction with Dr. Orton. Now, mark the wonder that here appears: After a season of months and years, Comes up again the dead man, Who, in a very practical way, Says he'll bring his bones some day, And give them again to Redman. When, sure enough (Though some that are rough Might call the narrative “devilish tough”), One charming day In the month of May, As Orton and Redman walked the street, Through the severing air, From they knew not where, Came a positive bone, all bleached and bare, That dropped at the doctor's wondering feet! Then the sprightly dead man Knocked out to Redman The plan that lay in his ghostly head, man: He'd carry the freight, Unheeding its weight; They needn't question how, or about it; But they might be sure The bones he'd procure, And not make any great bones about it. From that he made it a special point Each day for their larder to furnish a joint! From overhead, and from all around, Upon the floor, and upon the ground, Pell-mell, Down fell Low bones, and high bones, Jaw bones, and thigh bones, Until the doctors, beneath their power, Ducked like ducks in a thunder-shower! Armfuls of bones, Bagfuls of bones, Cartloads of bones, No end to the multitudinous bones, Until, forsooth, this thought gained head, man, That this invisible friend, the dead man, Had chartered a band From the shadowy land, Who had turned to work with a busy hand, And boned all their bones for Dr. Redman! Now, how to account for all the mystery Of this same weird and fantastical history? That is the question For people's digestion, And calls aloud for instant untwistery! Of this we are certain, By this lift of the curtain, That still they're alive for work or enjoyment, Though I must confess That I scarcely can guess Why they don't choose some useful employment. PREACHING TO THE POOR. Father Taylor once said, “'Tis of no use to preach to empty stomachs.” The parson preached in solemn way, —A well-clad man on ample pay,— And told the poor they were sinners all, Depraved and lost by Adam's fall; That they must repent, and save their souls. A hollow-eyed wretch cried, “Give us coals!” Then he told of virtue's pleasant path, And that of ruin and of wrath; How the slipping feet of sinners fell Quick on the downward road to h?, To suffer for sins when they are dead; And the hollow voice answered, “Give us bread!” Then he spoke of a land of love and peace, Where all of pain and woe shall cease, Where celestial flowers bloom by the way, Where the light is brighter than solar day, And there's no cold nor hunger there. “O,” says the voice, “Give us clothes to wear!” Then the good man sighed, and turned away, For such depravity to pray, That had cast aside the heavenly worth For the transient and fleeting things of earth! And his church that night, to his content, Raised his salary fifty per cent.</field>
