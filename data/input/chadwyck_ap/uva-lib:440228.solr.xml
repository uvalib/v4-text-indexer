      <field name="fulltext">TO MAUD. JOAQUIN. Shadows that shroud the to-morrowâ Glists from the life that's withinâ Traces of pain and of sorrow. And maybe a trace of sinâ Reachings for God in the darkness, And forâwhat should have been. Stains from the gall and the wormwoodâ Dead Sea apples and myrrhâ Ghost of a soul by a nearthstoneâ Blotches of heart's blood here, But never the sound of a wailingâ Never the sign of a tear. [I.] Glintings of day in a darknessâ Flashings of flint and of steelâ Blended in gossamer texture, The ideal and the real, Limn'd like the phantom-ship-shadow, Crowding up under the keel. I stand beside the mobile sea, And sails are spread and sails are furled, And ships go up and ships go down In haste, like traders in a town, And seem to see and beckon all. Afar I see a white shape flee With arms outstretched like ghost's to me, Then slides down to the under-world. Black mastsâas if a winter's wind Had shorn them bare of leaf and limbâ Are rising from the restless sea So still and desolate and tall, I almost see them gleam and shine From clinging drops of dripping brine. Broad still brown wings slide here and there, Thin sea-blue wings wheel everywhere, And white wings whistle through the air. I hear a thousand sea-gulls call. Behold the Ocean on the beach Kneel lowly down as if in prayer. I hear a moan as of despair, While far at sea do toss, and reach Somethings so like white pleading hands. The Ocean's thin and hoary hair Is trailed along the rolling sands, At every sigh and sounding moan. 'Tis not a place for mirthfulness, But meditation deep, and prayer, And kneelings on the salted sod, Where man must own his littleness And know the mightiness of God. The very birds shriek in distress And sound the Ocean's monotone. Dared I but say a prophecy, As sang the holy men of old, Of rock-built cities yet to be Along these rolling sands of gold, Crowding athirst into the sea, What wondrous marvels might be told. Enough, to know that empire here Shall burn her loftiest, brightest star. Here art and eloquence shall reign, As o'er the wolf-reared realm of old; Here learned and famous from afar To pay their noble court shall come, And shall not seek or see in vain, But look on all with wonder dumb. Afar the gleaming Sierras lie Against a ground of bluest sky. A long bent line of stainless white, As if Diana's maid last night Had in the liquid soft moonlight Washed out her mistress' garments bright, And on yon bent and swaying line Hung all her linen out to dry. I look along each gaping gorgeâ I hear a thousand sounding strokes Like brawny Vulcan at his forge, Or giants rending giant oaks. I see pick-axes flash and shine And great wheels whirling in a mine. Here winds a thick and yellow thread, A mossed and silver stream instead; And trout that leaped its rippled tide Have turned upon their sides and died. Lo! when the last pick in the mine Is rusting red with idleness, And rot yon cabins in the mold, And wheels no more croak in distress, And tall pines re-assert command, Sweet bards along this sunset shore Their mellow melodies will pourâ Will charm as charmers very wiseâ Will strike the harp with master handâ Will sound unto the vaulted skies The valour of these men of oldâ The mighty men of 'Forty-Nineâ Will sweetly sing and proudly say, Long, long agone there was a day When there were giants in the land. II. What rider rushes on the sight Adown yon rocky long defile Swift as an eagle in his flightâ Fierce as a winter's storm at nightâ In terror born on Sierra's height, Careening down some yawning gorge? His face is flushed, his eye is wild, And 'neath his courser's sounding feetâ A glance could barely be more fleetâ The rocks are flashing like a forge. Such reckless rider! I do ween No mortal man his like has seen. And yet, but for his long serape All flowing loose and black as crape, And long silk locks of blackest hair All streaming wildly in the breeze, You might believe him in a chair, Or chatting at some country Fair With friend or senorita fair, He rides so grandly at his ease. But now he grasps a tighter reinâ A red rein wrought in golden chainâ And in his heavy stirrup standsâ Half turns and shakes a bloody hand And hurls imaginary blows And shouts defiance at his foesâ Now lifts his broad hat from his brow As if to challenge fate, and now His hand drops to his saddle-bow And clutches something gleaming there As if to something more than dareâ While checks the foe as quick as though His own hand rested on each rein. The stray winds lift the raven curlsâ Soft as a fair Castilian girl'sâ And press a brow so full and high, Its every feature does belie The thought, he is compelled to fly. A brow as open as the sky, On which you gaze and gaze again As on a picture you have seen That seems to hold a tale of woeâ Or wonderâyou would seek to know. A brow cut deep, as with a knife, With many a dubious deed in life; A brow of blended pride and pain, And yearnings for what should have been. He grasps his gilded gory rein, And wheeling like a hurricane, Defying flood, or stone, or wood, Is dashing down the gorge again. O never yet has prouder steed Borne master nobler in his need. There is a glory in his eye That seems to dare, and to defy Pursuit, or time, or space, or race. His body is the type of speed, While from his nostril to his heel Are muscles as if made of steel. He is not black, nor gray, nor white, But 'neath that broad serape of night, And locks of darkness streaming o'er, His sleek sides seem a fiery red, Though maybe red with gore. What crimes have made that red hand red? What wrongs have written that young face With lines of thought so out of place? Where flies he? And from where has fled? And what his lineage and race? What glitters in his heavy belt And from his furred catenas gleam? What on his bosom that doth seem A diamond bright or dagger's hilt? The iron hoofs that still resound Like thunder from the yielding ground Alone reply; and now the plain, Quick as you breathe and gaze again, Is won. Pursuit is baffled and in vain. III. I stand upon a stony rim. A rock-lipped cannon plunging south Yawns deep and darkling at my feet, So deep, so distant and so dim Its recess winds, a yellow thread, And calls so faintly and so far, I turn aside my swooning head As from a mighty yawning mouth Of earth that opens into hell. I feel a fierce impulse to leap Adown the beetling precipice Like some lone, lost, uncertain starâ To plunge into a place unknown And win a world all, all my own; Or if I might not meet such bliss, At least escape the curse of this I gaze again. A gleaming star Shines back as from some mossy well Reflected from blue fields afar. Brown hawks are wheeling here and there, And up and down the broken wall Cling clumps of dark green chaparral. While from the rent rocks, gray and bare, Blue junipers hang in the air. Then crowding to the yellow stream, Low cabins nestle as in fear Among the boulders mossed and brown That time and storms have tumbled down From towers undefiled by man, And look no taller than a span. From low and shapeless chimneys rise Some tall straight columns of blue smoke, And weld them to the bluer skies; While sounding down the silent gorge, I hear the steady pick-axe stroke, As if upon a flashing forge. Another scene, another sound. Sharp shots are fretting through the air, Red knives are flashing everywhere, And here and there the yellow flood Is purpled with warm smoking blood. The brown hawk swoops low to the ground, And nimble chip-munks, small and still, Dart striped lines across the sill That lordly feet shall press no more. The flume lies warping in the sun, The pan sits empty by the door, The pick-axe on its bed-rock floor Lies rusting in the silent mine. There comes no single sound or sign Of life, besides yon munks in brown That dart their dim shapes up and down The rocks that swelter in the sun; But darting round yon rocky spur Where scarce a hawk would dare to whir, Fly horsemen reckless in their flight. One wears a flowing black capote, While down the cape doth flow and float Long locks of hair as dark as night, And hands are red that erst were white. I look along the valley's edge, Where curves the white road like a surge Along a sea of sage, and hedge Of black and brittle chaparral, And enters like an iron wedge Drove deep into yon rocky gorge As if to split the hills in twain. Two clouds of dust roll o'er the plain, And men ride up and men ride down, And hot men halt and curse and shout, And coming coursers plunge and neigh. The clouds of dust are rolled in one, And horses, horsemen, where are they? Lo! through a rift of dust and dunâ Of desolation and of routeâ I see some long white daggers flashâ I hear the sharp hot pistols crash, And curses loud in mad despair Are blended with a plaintive prayer That struggles through the dust and air. The cloud is lifting like a veil. The frantic curse, the plaintive wail, Have died away; nor sound or word Along the dusty plain is heard Save sounding of yon courser's feet That flies so fearfully and fleet, With gory girth and broken rein, Across the hot and trackless plain. Behold him, as he trembling flies, Look back with red and bursting eyes To where his gory master lies. The cloud is lifting like a veil, But underneath its drifting sail I see a loose and black serape Far float and fly in careless heed, So vulture-like above a steed Of perfect mould and passing speed. Here lies a man of giant mould, His mighty right arm perfect bareâ Except its sable coat of hairâ Is clutching in its iron clasp A clump of sage, as if to hold The earth from slipping from his grasp; While stealing from his brow a stain Of purple blood and gory brain Yields to the parched lips of the plain, Swift to resolve to dust again. Here lies a youth whose fair face is Still holy from a mother's kiss; While friend and foe blend here and there With dusty lips and trailing hair; Some with a cold and sullen stareâ Some with their red hands bent in prayer. IV. The sun is red and flushed and dry, And fretted from his weary beat Across the hot and desert sky, And swollen as from overheat, And failing too, for, see, he sinks Swift as a ball of burnished ore. It may be fancy, but methinks He never fell so fast before. I hear the neighing of hot steedsâ I see the marshalling of men That silent move among the trees With step and stealthiness profound, On carpetings of spindled weeds, Without a syllable or sound Save clashing of their burnished arms Clinking sepulchral alarmsâ Grim bearded men and brawny men That grope among the ghostly trees. Were ever silent men as these? Was ever sombre forest deep And dark as this? Here dreamy sleep Might wrap the lids a thousand years, Nor wake nor weep for sun or sound. A stone's throw to the right, a rock Has reared his head among the starsâ An island in the bluer deepâ And on his front a thousand scars Of thunder's crash and earthquake's shock Are seamed, as if by sabre stroke Of gods, enraged that he should rear His front amid their realms of air. What moves along his beetling brow, So small, so indistinct and far, This side yon blazing evening star, Seen through that redwood's shifting bough? A lookout on the world below? A watcher for the friendâor foe? This still troop's sentry it must be. Yet seems no taller than my knee. But for the grandeur of this gloom, And for the chafing steeds' alarms, And brown men's sullen clash of arms, This were but as a living tomb. These weeds are spindled, pale and white, As if nor sunshine, life or light Had ever reached this forest's heart. Above, the redwood boughs entwine Thick as a copse of tangled vine; Above, so fearfully afar, It seems as 'twere a second skyâ A sky without a moon or star, The mossed boughs are so thick and high. At every lisp of leaf I start! Would I could hear a cricket trill, Or that yon sentry from his hill Might shout or show some sign of life, The place doth seem so deathly still. âMount ye, and forward for the strife,â Who by yon dark trunk sullen stands, With black serape and flowing hair, And coldly gives his brief commands? They mountâaway.âQuick on his heel He turns, and grasps his gleaming steel, Then sadly smiles, and stoops to kiss An upturned face so sweetly fairâ So sadly, saintly, purely fairâ So rich of blessedness and bliss, I know she is not flesh and blood, But some sweet spirit of this wood. I know it by her wealth of hair, And step on the unyielding airâ Her seamless robe of shining white, Her soul-deep eyes of darkest night; But over all and more than all That could be said or can befallâ That tongue can tell or pen can trace, That wondrous witchery of face. Among the trees I see him stride To where a red steed fretting stands Impatient for his lord's commands; And she glides noiseless at his side, And not a bud, or leaf, or stem, The way she went, is broke or bent; They only nodded as she stepped, And all their grace and freshness kept, And now will bloom As though fresh risen from a tomb, For fairest sun has shone on them. âThe world is mantling black again. Beneath us, o'er the sleeping plain, Dull steel gray clouds slide up and down As if the earth still wore a frown. The west is red with sunlight slain.â (One hand toys with her waving hair, Soft lifting from her shoulders bare; The other holds the loosened rein, And rests upon the swelling mane That curls the curved neck o'er and o'er Like waves that swirl along the shore. He hears the last retreating sound Of iron on volcanic stone, That echoes far from peak to plain, And 'neath the thick wood's darkened zone He peers the rugged Sierras down.) âBut darker yet shall be the frown, And redder yet shall be the flame. And yet I would that it were notâ That all forgiven or forgot, Of curses deep and awful crimes, Of blood and terror, could but seem Some troubled and unholy dreamâ That even now I could awake, And waking, find me once again, With hand and heart without a stain. Swift gliding o'er that sunny lake, Begirt with town and castle wall, Where first I seen the silver lightâ Begirt with blossoms, and the bloom Of orange; sweet with the perfume Of cactus, pomegranate, and all The thousand sweets of tropic climesâ And waking, see the mellow moon Poured out in gorgeous plenilune On silver ripples of that tideâ And waking, hear soft music pour Along that flora-formÃ¨d shoreâ And waking, find you at my sideâ My father's mossed and massive hallsâ My brothers in their strength and pride.â (His hand forsakes her raven hair, His eyes have an unearthly glare. She shrinks and shudders at his side, Then lifts to his her moistened eye, And only looks her sad reply. A sullenness his soul enthrallsâ A silence born of hate and pride. His fierce volcanic heart, so deep, Is stirred; his teeth, despite his will, Do chatter as if in a chill. His very dagger at his side Does shake and rattle in its sheath Like blades of brown grass in a gale Do rustle on the frosted heath, And yet he does not bend or weep.) âI did not vow a girlish vow, Nor idle imprecation now Will I bestow by boasting word. Feats of the tongue become the knave. A wailing in the land is heard For those that will not come again; And weeping for the rashly brave, Who sleep in many a gulch and glen, Has wet a hundred hearths with tears, And darkened them for years and years. I would their tears were clotted gore, And every hearth as cold as one Is now upon that sweet lake shore, Where my dear kindred dwelt of yoreâ Where now is but an ashen heap, And mass of mossy earth and stoneâ Where round the altar black wolves keep Their carnival and doleful moanâ Where hornÃ¨d lizards dart and climb, And molluscs slide and leave their slime. But tremble not. This night alone Shall see my vengeance fully done; And ere the day-star gleams again My horse's hoofs shall spurn the deadâ The yet warm reeking dead of those Of that coarse, cold, inhuman race, With snake-like eyes and leprous face, That wrought us all our deadly woes. While all my glad returning way Shall be as light as living day, From towns and campos burning red. They say they seek me! seek Joaquin! That they have sought me far and wide! Ha! Oftener this hand I ween My boasting foes have felt and seen Of late, than suits their spleen or pride. Too well they know, nor day nor night, But with the least of search or care They all could find him if they dare But they, pale boasters of the fight, Shall deem him never half so near, Or warm friend never half so dear, To them as I shall be to-night. And yet I know I go to meet Full twice the numbers I have here. I would their numbers treble were, My vengeance would be more complete. âAnd then! And then, my peri pearl,â (As if to charm her from her fears And drive away the starting tears, Again his small hand seeks a curl And voice forgets its sullen tone, And eye forsakes its lofty scorn,â) Away to where the orange-tree Is white through all the cycled years, And love lives an eternityâ Where birds are never out of tune And life knows no decline of noonâ Where climes are sweet as woman's breath, And purpled, dreamy, mellow skies Are lovely as a woman's eyes. There, we in calm and perfect bliss Of boundless faith and sweet delight Will realise the world above, Forgetting all the wrongs of this, Forgetting all of blood and death, And all your terrors of to-night In pure devotion and deep love.â As gently as a mother bows Her first-born sleeping babe above The cherished cherub lips to kiss, He bends to her his stately head. I do not heed the hallowed kissâ I do not hear the hurried vows Of passion, faith, unfailing loveâ I do not mark the prisoned sighâ I do not meet the moistened eye. A low, sweet melody is heard Like cooing of some Orient bird, So fine it does not touch the airâ So faint it stirs not anywhere. Faint as the falling of the dew; Low as a pure unuttered prayer; The meetingâmingling, as it were, Of souls in paradisial bliss. Erect, again he grasps the rein So tight, as to the seat he springs The horse doth on his haunches poise And beat the air with iron feet, And curve his noble, glossy neck, And toss on high his swelling maneâ And leapâawayâhe spurns the rein And flies so fearfully and fleet, But for the hot hoofs' ringing noise, 'Twould seem as if he was on wings. And she is goneâgone like a breath, Gone like a white sail seen at night, A moment and then lost to sightâ Gone like a star you look upon That glimmers to a beadâa speck, Then softly melts into the dawn, And all is still as death. Where has that passing glory gone? That coal-black curling cloud of hair? The dark woods answering, echo, where? V. She stands upon the wild watch-tower And with her own hand feeds the flameâ The beacon light to guide again His coming from the battle plain. 'Tis wearing past the midnight hour, The latest that he ever came, Yet silence reigns around the tower. 'Tis hours past the midnight hour, She calls, she looks, she lists in vain For sight or sound from peak or plain. She moves along the beetling towerâ She stoops, her ear low to the ground, In hope to catch the welcome sound Of iron on the rugged stone. In vain she peers down in the night, But for one feeble flash of light From flinty stone and feet of steel. She stands upon the fearful rim, Where even coolest head would reel, And fearless leans her form far o'er Its edge, and lifts her hands to him, And calls in words as sweetly wild, As bleeding saint or sorrowing child; She looks, she lists, she leans in vain, In vain his dalliance does deplore; She turns her to the light again, And bids the watchman to the plain, Defying night or dubious way, To guide the flight or join the fray, And she is watching all alone. The day-star dances on the snow That gleams along the Sierra's crown, In gorgeous everlasting glow And frozen glory and renown. Yet still she feeds the beacon flame, And lists, and looks, and leans in vain. The day has dawned. She still is there! Yet in her sad and silent air I read the stillness of despair. Why burns the red light on the tower So brightly at this useless hour? But see! The day-king hurls a dart At darkness, and his cold black heart Is pierced, and he, compelled to flee, Flies to his caverns in the sea. And now, behold, she radiant stands, And lifts her thin white jewelled hands Unto the broad, unfolding sun, And hails him Tonatiu and King, With hallowed mien and holy prayer. Her fingers o'er some symbols run, Her knees are bowed in worshipping Her Godâbeheld when thine is notâ In form and faith long, long forgot. Again she lifts her white arms bare That gleam with jewels rich and rare. Was ever mortal half so fair? Was ever such a wealth of hair? Was ever such a plaintive air? Was ever such a sweet despair? Still humbler now her form she bendsâ Still higher now the flame ascends, She bares her bosom to the sun. Again her jewelled fingers run In signs, and sacred form and prayer. She bows with awe and holy air In lowly worship to the sun, The rising, calls her lover's name, And leaps into the leaping flame. I do not hear the faintest moan, Or sound, or syllable, or tone. The red flames stoop a moment down As if to raise her from the ground; Then stand up, tall, tiptoed, as one Would hand a soul up to the sun. VI. Eternal Popocatapetl! Isolated and apart In the untrod desert's heart; Grandly, grimly, and alone He stands a burning mono-stone. Unceasing as the numian shrine, Afar his red lips glow and shine, And typify the flames of hell. Who in the under-world unknown For ever feed this awful flame, And make this mount their altar-stone? Who but the Montezumas gone, Kings of the children of the sun? Last of a thousand ruined shrines! Look round you where the cactus twines His yellow roots through thin green sods That grow above the marble hewn Thick with their chronicles unread, And deeds of their great forgotten dead. On columns o'er white deserts strewnâ On cities where the hearth appears Rent by roots of a thousand years; Yet this one altar, this alone Of all the relics that are known Of the faithful children of the sun Burns to their strange forgotten gods. And this one lone eternal flame, Which robber's knife, Nor red castile, Nor civil strife, Nor Hapsburg steel, Nor time, nor tyranny can tame, Shall burn when all but time are notâ When even their names shall be forgot. O Italy of the Occident! Land of flowers and summer climesâ Of holy priests and horrid crimes; Land of the cactus and sweet cocoa, Richer than all the Orient In gold and gloryâin want and woeâ In self-denialâin days misspentâ In truth and treasonâin good and guiltâ In ivied ruins and altars lowâ In battered walls and blood misspilt, Glorious, gory Mexico! I look far down a dewy vale Where cool palms lean along a brook As crooked as a shepherd's crook. Red parrots call from orange-trees, Whose white lips kiss the idle breeze, And murmur with the hum of beesâ The gray dove cooes his low love-tale. With cross outstretched like pleading hands That mutely plead the faith of Christ, Amid the palms a low church stands. I would that man might learn from these The priceless victories of peace, And deem strife but a deadly vice. I see black clouds of troops afar Sweep like a surge that sweeps the shore, And checkering all the green hills o'er Are battlements and signs of war. I hear the hoarse-voiced cannon roarâ The red-mouthed orators of warâ Plead as they never plead before; While outdone thunder stops his car And leans in wonderment afar. A Hapsburg king has crossed the main And Gaul and Aztec strew the plain. God will not look upon the scene, But sorrowing spreads a sombre screen Of smoke o'er those that battle there, And leaves them to death and despair. A fragment from the battle broke Forsakes the sullen dun of smoke And winds it painfully and slow Amid the cool and peaceful palms To where yon gray church open stands, As if it bore a load of woe. Currajo! 'tis a chief they bear! And by his black and flowing hair Methinks I have seen him before. A black priest guides them through the doorâ They lay him bleeding on the floor. He moves, he lifts his feeble hand And points with tried and trenchÃ¨d brand, And bids them to the battle plain. They turnâthey pauseâhe bids againâ They turn a last time to their chief, And gaze in silence and deep pain, For silence speaks the deepest grief. They clutch their bladesâthey turnâare gone, And priest and chief are left alone. âAnd here it ends. Here all is not. I am content. 'Tis what I sought. There is nor price, nor ban, nor power, Nor plea, nor place, nor woman's smile That could my weary soul beguile, Or keep it from repose an hour. Yet even had I ties on earth, I know not why I should deplore To die e'en at this age and hour, Since I have seen and suffered more Than they who live a full threescore; And sorrow is the sum of life, And I began it at my birth. And I have known, I know not why, Through all my dubious days of strife, That when we live our deeds we dieâ That man may in one hour live All that his life can bear or give. This I have done, and do not grieve; For I am older by a score Then many born long, long before, If sorrows be the sum of life. âAye! I am oldâold as the years Could brand me with their blood and tears, For with my fingers I can trace Grief's trenches on my hollow face, And through my thin frame I can feel The pulses of my frozen heart Beat with a dull uncertain start. And mirrored in my sword to-day, Before its edge of gleaming steel Had lost its lustre in the fray, I seen around my temples stray Thin, straggling locks of steely gray. âO for the rest!âfor the rest eternal! O for the deep and the dreamless sleep! Where never a hope lures to deceive! Where never a heart beats but to grieve; Nor thoughts of heaven or hells infernal Shall even wake or dare to break The rest of an everlasting sleep! Time has not set his seal on youâ Not one dark hair has lost its hue; Yet I, indeed, might be your son, In yearsâbut not in actions done. But what is time? and what are years In reckoning of age and life? 'Tis measured by the deeds of strifeâ And passionsâhateâand loveâand tears. âShe was the lastâlast of her kindâ Last of a race of gods and kingsâ Last of the Montezumas' line That dwelt up in the yellow sun; But sorrowing for man's despair, Slid by his trailing, yellow hair To earth, to rule with love and bring The blessedness of peace to man. She was the lastâlast earthly one Of the eternal children of the sunâ A sweet perfume still lingering In essence pure, and living on In blessedness about the spot When rose, and bush, and bloom were not. âBeside Tezcuco's flowery shore Where waves were washing evermore The massive columns of the wall, Stood Montezumas' mighty hall. And here the Montezumas reigned In perfect peace and love unfeigned, Until from underneath the seaâ Where all sin is, or ought to beâ Came men of death and strange device, Who taught a strange and mystic faith Of crucifixion and of Christâ More hated than the plague or death. Nay do not swing your cross o'er meâ You crossed you once, but do not twice, Nor dare repeat the name of Christâ Nor startânot think to flyânor frown, While you the stole and surplice wear, For I do clutch your sable gown, And you shall hear my curseâor prayer, And be my priest in my despair; Since neither priest, or sign, or shrine, Is left in all the land, of mine. âEnough! We know, alas! too well How Christ has ruledâTonatiu fell. The black wolf in our ancient halls Unfrightened sleeps the live-long day. The stout roots burst our mossy walls, And in the moonlight wild dogs play Around the plaza overgrown Where nude boars hold their carnivals. The moss is on our altar-stone, The mould on Montezumas' throne, And symbols in the desert strown. âAnd when your persecutions ceased From troop, and king, and cowlÃ¨d priest, That we had felt for centuriesâ (Ah, know you priest that cross of thine Is but death's symbol; and the sign Of blood and butchery and tears?)â Returned again the faithful few, Beside Tezcuco's sacred shore To build their broken shrines anew, They numbered scarce a broken score. Here dwelt my fatherâhere she dwelt: Here kept one altar burning brightâ Last of the thousands that had shone Along yon mountain's brow of stoneâ Last of a thousand stars of night. To Tonatiu Ytzaqual we knelt. Nay, do not start, nor shape the sign Of horror at this creed of mine, Nor call again the name of Christ. You cross you once, you cross you twiceâ I warn you do not cross you thrice. Nor will I brook a sign or look Of anger at the faith she felt. I am no creedist. Faith to me Is but a name for mystery. I only know this faith was hers, I care to know no more to be The truest of its worshippers. âBut useless that I do prolong The tale of tyranny and wrong, Well known to you as 'tis to me. The Saxon came across the sea With gory blade and brand of flame. I know not that he knew or cared What was our race, or creed, or name; I only know the Paynim dared Assault and sack for sake of gain Of sacred vessels wrought in gold The temple where gods dwelt of old; And that my father, brothers, dared Defend their shrines, and all were slain. âFull well we knew that we must fall When first the rude assault was made. âIt is not well we perish all, Fly, fly you with the holy maid. A boat chafes at the causeway side, Your youthful arm is useless here,â My noble father to me cried. I fled; was it the flight of fear? O how I chafed to join the fray! But I had been taught to obey; We gained the boatâsprang inâaway We dashed along the dimpled tide. It must have been they thought we bore The treasure in our sudden flight, For in an instant from the shore An hundred crafts were making chase, And as their sharp prows drew apace I caught my carbine to my face. She, rising, dashed it quick aside; And when their hands were stretched to clasp The boat's prow in their eager grasp, She turned to me, and sudden cried, âCome, come,â and plunged into the tide. I plunged into the dimpled wave, I had no thought but 'twas my grave; But faith had never follower More true than I to follow her. On through the purple wave she cleaves, As darts a sunbeam through the leaves. At lastâwhat miracle was there?â Again we breathed the welcome air, And resting by the rising tide, The secret outlet of the lake, Safe hid by trackless fern and brake, With yellow lilies at our side, She told me how in ages gone Her fathers built with sacred stone This secret way beneath the tide, That now was known to her alone. âWhen night came on and all was still, And stole the white moon down the hill, Soft, as if she too feared some ill, Again I sought the sacred halls And on the curving causeway stood. I lookedânaught but the blackened walls And charred bones of my kindred blood Was left beside the dimpled flood. âWe fled, and swiftly fledâand far Toward the frozen polar star Where Sierra's white locks float and flow In sheen of everlasting snowâ Where meek-eyed violets in blue Were shining in the beaded dew, And yellow blooms were bursting through The very crust of dripping snow. âThere is one thing I would forget, One theme I would not dwell upon; A skeleton for ever set Beside my desolate hearthstoneâ A wrong to her so deep and baseâ A deed so terrible and damned That even you would hide your face In shame to bear the shape of man, Should you but guess its black disgrace. âMy arm was nervedâmy soul was fire, I vented full the darkest ire. This steel has known no maiden stain To-day on yonder battle plain, A marvel if my northern slain Outnumbered not those of to-day That dead and dying yonder lay. âMy vengeance was complete; but she, Too sainted, beautiful, and pure, To stay on earth and still endure The dark stain and deep treachery, Returned back to the yellow sun. âI had enough of death and blood, I might, of life too, say the same, Since life and death, and good and ill, Had neither choice, or charm, or name, But all alike to me were one. I roamed o'er many a realm since then In sullen loneliness of thought, And inly smiled to talk to men Who boasted they had ofttimes seen The trunkless head of dread Joaquin. But when I learned a stranger sought To sit on Montezuma's throne That had in justice been my own, And make your cross the nation's creed, As did the Castile kings of old, My cold heart beat no longer cold. To tell the rest is little needâ And little time left to revealâ My eyes are dimâmy senses reelâ Enough! Mine was no tempered steel To-day upon the sulphurous field, As many trenched heads yonder feel, And many felt, that feel no more, That fought beneath your cross and sign, And falling, vainly called on Christâ You black monk! dare you cross you thrice? When I have warned you twice before, And swing your cursed cross o'er and o'er, But for which she had been my bride And sat a princess at my side? To you and your damned faith I owe My heritage of crime and woe; You shall not live to mock me more If there be temper in this brand, Or nerve left in this bloody handâ I start, I leave this stony ground, Despite of blood or mortal wound, Or darkness that has dimmed the eye, Or senses that do dance and reelâ I clutch a throatâI clench a steelâ I thrustâI failâI fallâI dieââ VII. The tinkle of bells on the blended hills, The hum of bees in the orange-trees And the lowly call of the beaded rills, Are heard in the land as I look again Over the peaceful battle-plain. For murderous man from the field has fled As if he feared the face of his dead. He bledâhe battledâhe ruled a day, And peaceful nature resumed her sway. But the sward where yonder corses lay, When the verdant season shall come again Shall greener grow than it grew before; Taking its freshness back once more From they that despoiled it yesterday. Death has been in at the low church door, For his foot-prints lie on the stony floor. There are raven locks of flowing hair; The stole and the surplice too are there; And I have seen them all before. A cross is clasped in one right hand, And one is clutching a blood-red brand, And all are silent, and thick with gore. The door is wide, the sill unpressed By saint, or Sadducee, or priestâ By friend or foe, or host or guest. The black bats cling about the wall, And from the cross that leans afar The gaunt, ungainly vultures call Like wolves that prowl and howl in war. The spiders' web, and dust within Usurp the altar and the shrine, And all the holy things therein Save but the cross, and Christ divine; There spiders weave a circle lace For ever round the holy face. The peons pass that way no more Except in bands, quick, stepping light, For white bones rattle in the aisle And hot blood smokes along the floor. While all the night a priest in white That watches in the open door, Will cross him once, and twice, and thrice, And wailing call the name of Christ? Then cross again; and all the while The white bones rattle in the aisle. While ever at the noon of day There rises from the gory floor A loose capote and cloud of hair, All darker than a thunder-storm, Enveloping a sullen form That looks a weary, sad despair. One worships Christ by night, and one By day is worshipping the sun. Waifs Argosies swirled, Once precious to me, Now cast on the world Like waifs from the sea. ZANARA. No! It was not well, Zanara, While the fever held its riotâ When the doctors bid be quietâ That you came to my bed-side In the middle of the night, With your two hands on your heartâ That you pressed on my bed-side In the absence of my bride, And so pressed upon your heart That the blood all thick and blackened. When your long white fingers slackened, Oozed betwen them to the floor. Oh! This mouldy, gory floor! Then your linen it was moulded, And streaked yellow where it folded, And your bosom it was bare, Which you know was nothing fair In the absence of my bride, Then your heavy, slimy hair, Creeping, clinging round your bosomâ Clammy bosom, blue and bare, Which you did not try to hide. Then your eyes had such a glare, And the smell of death was there, And the spirits that were with you Whistled through the mossy door, And they danced upon my bosom, And they tangled up my hair, And made crosses on the floor. No! All this was nothing fair While the fever held its riotâ When the doctors bid be quiet. It was not my fault, remember, All this life of black disastersâ All this life of dark Decemberâ All this heart-sickness and sadness, Though we both did have our masters, Yours was Love and mine Ambitionâ Mine is driving me toâmadness, Yours has drove you to perdition. But some time, if you so will it, When this hot brain is less rabidâ When our masters both are sleepingâ When the storm the stars is keeping, Leave the darkness where they laid youâ Leave the dampness you inhabitâ Leave that yellow, moulded linenâ That dull, sullen, frozen stare, And the cold death in your hair; Then I will no more upbraid you. I will meet you just one minute By the oak-tree, you remember, With the grape-vine tangled in itâ Meet you, while my bride is sleepingâ While the storm the stars is keeping. I will press your bosom goryâ I will tell you one sweet story, With sweet balm and healing in it. But remember, now remember, I can stay there but one minute. IN EXILE. Alone on this desolate borderâ On this ruggedest, rim'd frontier. Where the hills huddle up in disorder Like a fold in mortal fearâ Where the mountains are out at the elbow, And their yellow coats seedy and sereâ Where the river runs sullen and yellow This dismallest day of the year. I go up and go down on the granite, Like an unholy ghost under bans. Oh, Christ! for the eloquent quiet! For the final folding of hands! What am I? Where am I going? I look at the lizard that glides Over the mossy boulder With green epaulets on his sides. My feet are in dust to the ankles, My heart, it is dustier still; Will never the dust be levelled Till the heart is laid under the hill? Why this yearning and longing? This dull desolation and void? Pussy cat seeking a corner? Alone! yet for ever annoyed? I look at the sun shining over, A cloud is swinging on hinges And is trying his glory to cover. But see! his beams in the fringes Are tangled and fastened in falling, And a sailor above us is calling, âUntangle the ravels and fringes.â In grim battle lines above us Gray, oarless ships are wheelingâ A flashâa crash appallingâ A hurling of red-hot spearsâ Hark to the thunder calling In fierce infernal chorus. Now silver sails are falling Like silver sheens before us. What Nelson to fame aspires In the chartless bluer deep Where navies and armies track? Lo! I have seen their fires At night as they bivouac; And they battle, and bleed, and weep, For this rain is warm as tears. Oh! why was I ever a dreamer? Better a brute on the plain, Or one who believes his redeemer Is greed, and gold, and gain, Or one who can riot and revel, Than be pierced with intolerable pain Of poesy darling, in travail, That will not be born from the brain. O bride by the breathing ocean With lustrous and brimming eye, Pour out the Lethean potion Till a lustrum rolleth by, Lulling a soul's commotion, Plashing against the skyâ Calming a living spectre With its two hands tossed on high. Are sea winds mild and mellow Where my sun-browned babies are, A-weaving silk and yellow Seamed sunbeams in their hair? Go on and on in disorder O cloud with the silver rim, While tangled up in your border The glinting sunbeams swim. TO THE BARDS OF S. F. BAY. I am as one unlearned, uncouth, From country come to join the youth Of some sweet town in quest of truth; A skilless northern Nazareneâ From whence no good can ever come. I stand apart as one that's dumb. I hopeâI fearâI hasten home. I plunge into my wilds again. I catch your dulcet symphonies, I drink the low sweet melodies That stream through these dark feathered trees Like echoes from some far church-bell, Or music on the water spilled Beneath the still moon's holy spell, And life is sweeterâall is wellâ The soul is fed. The heart is filled. I move among these frowning firs, Black bats wheel by in rippled whirs, While naught else living breathes or stirs. I peepâI lift the boughs apartâ I tiptoe upâI try to riseâ I strive to gaze into the eyes Of charmers charming thus so wiseâ I coin your faces on my heart. I greet you on your brown bent hills Discoursing with the beaded rills, While over all the full moon spills His flood in gorgeous plenilune. White skilful hands sweep o'er the strings, I heed as when a seraph sings, I lean to catch the whisperings, I list into the night's sweet noon. I see you by the streaming strand, A singing sea-shell in each hand, And silk locks tossing as you stand, And tangled in the toying breeze. And lo! the sea with salty tears, While white hands toss, then disappear, Doth plead that you for years and years Will stay and sing unto the seas. MERINDA. And this then is all of the sweet life she promised! And this then is all of the fair life I painted! Dead, ashen fruit, of the dark Dead Sea border! Ah yes, and worse by a thousand numbers, Since that can be cast away at willing, While desolate life with its dead hope buried Clings on to the clay, though the soul despise it. Back, backward, to-night, is memory traversing, Over the desert my weary feet travelledâ Thick with the wrecks of my dear heart-idolsâ And toppling columns of my ambitionâ Red with the best of my hot heart's purple. Down under the hill and under the fir-tree, By the spring, and looking far out in the valley, She stands as she stood in the glorious Olden, Swinging her hat in her right hand dimpled. The other hand toys with a honey-suckle That has tiptoed up and tried to kiss her. Her dark hair is twining her neck and her temples Like tendrils some beautiful Parian marble. âO eyes of lustre and love and passion! O radiant face with the sea-shell tinted! White cloud with the sunbeams tangled in it!â I cried, as I stood in the dust beneath her, And gazed on the God my boy-heart worshipped With a love and a passion a part of madness. âDreamer,â she said, and a tinge of displeasure Swept over her face that I should disturb her, âAll of the fair world is spread out before you; Go down and possess it, with love and devotion, And heart ever tender and touching as woman's, And life shall be sweet as the first kiss of morning.â I turned down the pathway, blinded no longer; Another was coming, tall, manly, and bearded. I built me a shrine in the innermost templeâ In the innermost rim of the red pulsing heart And placed her therein, sole possessor and priestess, And carved all her words on the walls of my heart. They say that he wooed her there under the fir-tree And won her one eve, when the katydids mocked her. Well, he may have a maiden and call her Merinda; But mine is the one that stands there for ever Leisurely swinging her hat by the ribbons. They say she is wedded. No, not my Merinda, For mine stands for ever there under the fir-tree Gazing and swinging her hat by the ribbons. They tell me her children reach up to my shoulder. 'Tis false. I did see her down under the fir-tree When the stars were all busy a-weaving thin laces Out of their gold and the moon's yellow tresses, Swinging her hat as in days of the Olden. True, I didn't speak to or venture to touch herâ Touch her! I sooner would pluck the sweet Mary, The mother of Jesus, from arms of the priesthood As they kneel at the altar in holy devotion. And was it for this that my heart was kept tender? Fashioned from thine, O sacristan maiden!â That coarse men could pierce my warm heart to the purple? That vandals could enter and burn out its freshness? That rude men could trample it into the ashes? O was it for this that my heart was kept open? I looked in a glass, not the heart of man-mortal. Whose was the white soul I seen there reflecting? But trample the grape that the wine may flow freely! Beautiful priestess, mine, mine only, for ever! You still are secure. They know not your temple. They never can find it, or pierce it, or touch it, Because in their hearts they know no such a temple. I turn my back on them like Enos the Trojan. Much indeed leaving in wild desolation, But bearing one treasure alone that is dearer Than all they possess or have fiercely torn from me; A maiden that stands looking far down the valley Swinging her hat by its long purple ribbons. NEPENTHE. âOur life is two-fold:ââ âStill it lingering haunts the greenest spot On memory's waste.â I have a world, a world which is all my own, Which you, nor foe, nor friend, nor kith, nor kin, Nor even my own fiery soul, when churlish grown, Has entered, or shall ever pass therein; But when all of care and strife aside are thrown And I am free, then I am there, and am not alone. No, not alone, for standing there inviting me On the threshold is God's image made of pearl, And I relieve the elden time with that purityâ There with a queenly shrined and sainted girl, I press the green beneath the ancient tree, And vow the vows and redream the mystery. What though the real did happen years ago! What though our lives are wide, and still diverge? And both of us are wed? Admit it's so. Then sitting here to-night, will you, sir, urge We dare not live that past in all its glorious glow? Well! you may be good, but there are things you do not know. To-day I fight the manly pitted fight of life, I give back deftly hard dealt blow for blow, To-day is she the mother and the patient wife, Taking life a fact from fates that made it so; But lo! to-night I quit the struggling strife, She is young again, heart-full, and lips are rife. The long tilled turf is rich again and greenâ The long felled oak extends its hugest bough, And we are there as lang syne we have been, Giving troth for troth, and plighting vow for vowâ Holy vows for aye upon that belted green, Where no gray ghosts dare thrust themselves between. Yet in the morn, amid the reckless rush of life, First in the duties and foremost in the scene, She, the fond mother and most loyal wifeâ She the peerless of all that's goodly will be seen; And girded, I shall marshal for the strife Without a thought of the glorious âmight have been.â And you do star-ward point and bid me twine The hopes and promise round the crumbling heart. Well, I have tried, wept and watched to read the sign, But heaven, my friend,ânay, now, do not startâ But heavenâmy heaven at least, is in that sweet lang syneâ There in that world so solely and so completely mine. UNDER THE OAKS. Oaks of the voiceless ages! Precepts! Poems! Pages! Lessons! Leaves and volumes! Arches! Pillars! Columns In the corridors of ages! Grand patriarchal sages! Their Druid beards are drifting And shifting to and fro, Down to their waists in zephyrs, That bat-like come and go; The while the moon is sifting A sheen of shining snow On all these blossoms lifting Their blue eyes from below. The night has cast his mantle Down on the day's remains; For he lies dead before us. I seen his red blood stains At twilight drifting o'er us, And these oaks chant above him In stately, solemn strains, For ah! these Druids love him, That knightly day that's slain, And they will robe in sable Till he shall rise again. I have no tears or sighing, For he was not kind to meâ This dead day here before us, O mossy Druid tree With dark brow bending o'er us! He was not kind to me, I will not wail his dying. No. It is not green leaves rustling That your hear lisping there, But bearded, mossy Druids Counting beads in prayer. No. Not a night-bird singing, Nor breeze a green bough swinging: But that bough holds a censer And swings it to and fro; 'Tis Sunday eve, remember, That's why they chant so low. DIRGE. The silver cord loosed, The golden bowl broken, The sunbeam has fallen, The Saviour has spoken. The yew and the cypress, By Lethe's dark tide, Are sweeping to-dayâ A miner has died! âThe white sands have crumbled Away from his tread,â By eternity's oceanâ A miner is dead! His lamp has gone out; What else can be done Than lay him to sleep Till the light of the sun? Pine slabs! what of it? Marble is dust, Cold and as silentâ And iron is rust. VALE. To those who have known my mad life's troubles I leave these linesâ'tis all I have to leave Save faults and follies; the dreams and bubbles Of my young life; and O I grieve In tears of blood I could not worthier weave. True, 'tis a farewell piece but poorly spoken, It is an adieu song but harshly sung; For the heart beats dull and the harp is broken, And the hand that o'er the keys is flung Is nerveless now, and the chords unstrung. The round red sun is set for me for ever, And nebulous darkness is rolling from afar; And I stand adown by death's dark river Calmly and alone, for the thoughts that war Have died, or dimly burn, as yon sweet star. 'Tis well I stand by the rushing river, Up to my knees in the blackened tide; The sounding waters will drown for ever The critic's jeers and paynim pride,â And reviews are not ferried to the other side. So life is but a day of weary fretting As a sickly babe for its mother gone; And I fold my hands, only this regretting: That I have writ no thought, or thing, not one, That lives, or earns a cross or cryptic stone. BENONI. A strophe wove of sylvan warp And woof of weeds and beaded stroudsâ A symphony from shivered harp, Where sentiment the sense enshrouds; But read, before you ruthless carpâ Perchance it has some truthâsome goodâ Seen like the summit of Mount Hood When bursting through the rolling clouds. âThe landlady and Tam were gracious Wi' favours secret, rich and precious. The souter told his queerest stories, The landlord's laugh was ready chorus. The storm without might rear and rustle, Tam didna mind the storm a whistle.â âBurns. I. Down from the town of Del Renalda, With only a half-hushed imprecation On feasts, and priests, and the invitation Had come the long and lean Alcaldeâ And many a priest with shaven pateâ And many a long-tongued advocateâ Sat and sipped with him long and lateâ Sat and sipped of the blushing wine, Crushed from the Occidental vineâ Sipped of the wine of San Diego, Sipped of the wine of Saint Benito,â Feasting full in commemoration Of the Holy Mary's Annunciation. And they sipped late, and they sat long In joyous bout and wild wassail, And many a secret, gushing tale Was told, and many an amorous song Shook the adobes till chanticleer Arousing, echoed their song and cheer. The wine poured in, the secrets out, As water poured in drain or spout Will put the rats and mice to routâ Poured out secrets of wife and clientâ From these wine-brave men defiantâ From all but one, the tall, lean judge; Few were the quaffs his thin lips passedâ Fewer the words that from them fell; And even these he did begrudge, As you might yellow coins that shine In hands of a brainless Broadway swell, And looked the while as if to tell Something of casting pearls to swine. With lifted cups the judge they pressed, Careless of host and careless of guest, And loudly called for a song or tale. Secrets are sought with ill intent, And only the evil are insolent. An advocate, with a tawny skin, Whose tongue kept constant dong and dinâ Cried, âWhat! are you a Plantagenet That leapt full-grown this great world in? For I swear by the cross I much mistake If there is a man in Mexico Who doth a line of your life know Farther agone than this decade.â A hand on the rude one's lips was laid. âSacred, my son,â the priest went onâ âSacred the secrets of every oneâ Inviolate as an altar-stone. But what in the life of one who must Have lived so pure to be so just?â What can there be, O advocate, In the life of one so desolate, Of luck with matron, or love with maid, Midnight revel or escapade, To stir the wonder of men at wine? Surely duller than chant of mine Told at eve at the vestry door To sleeping worshippers; ten times o'er. But should the judge, his honour, though (And here his voice fell soft and low As he sat, his wine-horn in its place, And looked in the judge's care-worn face) Weave us a tale, that points a moral, Out of his rich imagination, Of lass, or love, or lovers' quarrel, Naught of his fame or name or station Shall be lessened by its relation.â Softly the judge sat down his hornâ Kindly he looked on the priests all shorn, And gazed in the eyes of the advocate With a touch of pity, but none of hate; Then looked down into the brimming horn, Half defiant and half forlorn. Was it a tear? Was it a sigh? Was it a glance of the priest's black eye? Or was it the drunken revel cry That smote the rock of his frozen heart And tore his purple lips apart? Or was it the weakness like to woman Yearning for sympathy Through the dark yearsâ Spurning the secresy, Burning for tears, Proving him human? II. âIt may be where white moonbeams kneel At night beside some rugged steep; It may be where mad breakers reel, Or mild waves cradle men to sleep; It might have been in peaceful life, Or mad tumult and storm and strife, I drew my breath; it matters not. A silvered head, an humble cot, A peaceful stream, a balmy clime, A cloudless sky, a sister's smile, A mother's love, a church-bells' chime Are mineâare with me all the whileâ Are hung on memory's sounding hallsâ Are graven on her glowing walls; But rage, nor rack, nor wrath of man, Nor prayer of priest, nor price, nor ban, Can wring from me their place or name, Or whence they went, or whence I came. âOut in the autumn world a waif, Drifting away like a wayward leaf; A girlish form and a childish faceâ A dead leaf drifting from place to place. âWhere mountains repose in their bluenessâ Where the sun first lands in his newness, To gather his beams and his lances Ere down to the vale he advances With vizor erect, and encountersâ The terrible night in his way, And slays him, and out of his blackness Hews out the beautiful day With his flashing sword of silver, Dwelt Iâand dwelt anotherâ Another?ânot myself!âperchance a brother? Say, is not life twain? Didst never think of yourself as one You knew in the dim days agone? âO for the skies of rolling blue! For the face as fair as hers you woo! For the voice like the call of the cockatoo In vespers calling the soul to bliss, In the blessÃ¨d love of the world above, Ere it has taken the stains of this. âSweet melodies were in the air, And tame birds carolled everywhere. I listened to the lisping grove And cooing pink-eyed turtle-dove. And, loving with the holiest loveâ Believing with a grand belief That everything beneath the skies Was beautiful and born to loveâ That man had but to loveâbelieveâ And earth would be a Paradise, As beautiful as that above; My goddess, Beauty, I adored, Devoutlyâfervidâher alone, My priestess. Love, unceasing poured Pure incense on her altar-stone. âWith rays of the red rising sun I pinned the clouds back from the sky, And stood like holy priest or nun With curtains parted left and rightâ Before the sacred cross and lightâ And lifting my two hands on high Would call to voices in the air; Then shade my eyes and shout replies To holy spirits calling there. And then again, in tamer mood, With bended knee and temples bare, Would look and listen as I stood, With bowed and reverential air, As if to some sweet sister's prayer. The while the world went sternly on, The dusty-booted passer-by, With blankets on his broad gray back, And face behind a masque of beard, Looked back, nor heard another cry Than shoutings of a dreaming boyâ Seen nought else but the dappled sky; Then onward bent his weary track And thought of ounces, slugs, and leadsâ And thought of Maud, and Kate, and May,â Their mother fair and far awayâ And raised his coarse sleeve to his eye. âAnd deep down in the cannon's mouth The long-tom ran and pick-axe rang, And stringing round the mountain high Were pack-trains coming from the south In long gray lines like wild geese fly. While muleteers shouted hoarse and high, And dusty, dusky muleteers sangâ SeÃ±ora with the liquid eye! No floods can ever quench the flame, Or Sierra's snow my passion tame, O Jouana with the coal-black eye! O seÃ±orita, bide a bye! III. âMistaken and misunderstood, My hot magnetic heart sought round And craved of all the souls I knew But one responsive throb or touchâ Or thrill that flashes through and through Deem you that I demanded much? Not one congenial soul was found. I sought a deeper wild and wood. A girlish form and a childish faceâ A wild waif drifting from place to place. Environed by a mountain wall, So fierce, so terrible and tall, It never yet had been defiled By track or trail; save by the wild, Free children of the wildest woodâ An unkissed virgin at my feet, Lay this pure, hallowed, dreamy vale; Where breathed the essence of my tale. Lone dimple in the mountain's faceâ Lone Eden in a boundless waste, It lay so beautiful! so sweet! âThere in the sun's decline I stood, By God's form wrought in pink and pearlâ My peerless, dark-eyed Indian girlâ And gazed with rapt and feasting eyes Upon an earthly paradise. Inclining to the south it lay, And one league southward rolled away, Until the sable, feathered pines And tangled boughs and amorous vines Closed like besiegers on the scene. The while the stream that intertwined Had barely room to flow between. It was unlike all other streams, Save those seen in sweet summer dreams. For sleeping in its snowy bed, Nor rock or stone was ever knownâ Only the shining, shifting sands, Sifted for ever by unseen hands. It curved, it bent like Indian bow, And like an arrow darted through, Yet uttered not a sound or breath; It was as swift, as still as death, Yet was so clear, so pure, so sweet, It wound its way into your heart As through the grasses at your feet. âDown through the tall untangled grass I seen the black bear careless pass, And caught my rifle to my face; She chid me with a quiet grace And said, âNot so, for us the day, The night belongs to such as they.â âAnd then from out the shadowed wood, The antlered deer came stalking down In half a shot of where I stood; Then stopped and stamped impatientlyâ Then shook his head and antlers highâ And then his keen horns backward threw Upon his shoulders broad and brown, And thrust his muzzle in the airâ Snuffed proudly, then a blast he blew As if to say, the coast is clear. And then from out the sable wood His mate and two sweet dappled fawns Stole forth, and by the monarch stood, She timid, while the little ones Would start like aspens in a gale. Then he, as if to re-assure The trembling and demure, Again his antlers backward threwâ Again a blast defiant blew, Then led them proudly down the vale. âI watched the forms of darkness come, Slow stealing from their sylvan home, And pierce the sunlight drooping low And weary, as if loth to go, With long black lances that were made From giant pine-trees' lengthened shade. He stained the lances as he bled, And bleeding, and pursued, he fled Across the vale into the wood. I seen the tall grass bend its head Beneath the stately martial tread Of the pursuer and pursued. âBehold the clouds,â Winnema said, âAll purple with the blood of day. The west is gory where he bled: The night has conquered in the fray, The shadows live and light is dead.â âShe turned to Shasta gracefully, Around whose hoar and mighty head Still lay a sea of golden red, While troops of clouds a space below, Were drifting wearily and slow, As seeking shelter for the night, Like weary sea-birds in their fight; Then curved her right arm gracefully Above her brow, and bowed her knee, And chanted in an unknown tongue Words sweeter than were ever sung. And what means this, I gently said; I spoke to God, the Yopitone Who sits on yonder snowy throne. She softly said with drooping head, I bowed to God. He heard me speakâ I felt his firm breath on my cheekâ He heard me all my wishes tell, And he is good, and all is well. âYou might have plucked beams from the moon, Or tore the shadow from the pine When on its dial track at noon, But not have parted us an hour Save by the force of brutal power; She was so wholly, truly mine. Our lives were one unbroken dream Of purest bliss and calm delightâ A flowery-shored untroubled streamâ A full-mooned serenading night. âOnce on a birch down by the way I carved my name in coarse design, At which she gazed, as she would say, What does this say? What is this sign? And when I gaily said, âSome day Some one will come and read my name When you and I have passed away, And I will live in song and fame, As he who first found this sweet vale; And they will give the place my name, Entwined with many a mountain tale,â She was most sad, and troubled much, And looked in silence far away; Then started trembling from my touch, And when she turned her face again I read unutterable pain And seen the stain of tears. âAh! yes; this, too, fulfils my fears. Yes, they will comeâmy race must go, As fades a vernal fall of snow; And you be known, and I forgot, Like these brown leaves that rust and rot Beneath my feet; and it is well; I do not seek to thrust my name On those who here, hereafter dwell, Because I have before them dwelt. For they will have their tales to tellâ They will ask their time and fame. âYes, they will come, come even nowâ The dim ghosts on yon mountain's browâ Gray fathers of our time and race Do beckon to us from their place, And hurl red arrows through the air At night, to bid our braves beware. A foot-print by the clear McCloud, Unlike aught ever seen before, Is seen. The crash of rifles loud Is heard along its farther shore. IV. âThe war-yell roused me from repose, I sprang forth like a frightened deerâ I heard the hot shots sharp and clear, And shoutings of my friendsâor foesâ Upon the crested mountain wall. I heard the war chief's rallying call In words of wildest eloquence, And seen the warriors marshalled all. And you?â she criedâan instantâthen I led in the van of the tallest men. I plunged in the fight with the fiery zeal That only the young and impulsive feel. I leapt in the fight with a fierce delightâ I led where the bravest quailed to follow, And plunging down a dense pine hollow Was mingled with my flying foes, And felled, and bound, and borne away, Their only trophy of the fray. âThe bore me bound for many a day Through fen and wild, by foamy flood, From my dear mountains far away, To where an adobe prison stood, Beside a sultry, sullen town, With iron eyes and stony frown; And in a dark and narrow cell, So hot it almost took my breath, And seemed but an outpost of hell, They thrust me; as if I had been The fiercest monster ever seen. I cried aloud, I courted deathâ I called unto a strip of skyâ The only thing beyond my cell That I could see; but no reply Came but the echo of my breath. I pacedâhow long I cannot tell, My reason failed, I knew no more, And swooning, fell upon the floor. âThen months went on, till deep one night, When long thin bars of lunar light Lay shimmering along the floor, My senses came to me once more. âMy eyes looked full into her eyesâ Into her soul so true and tried. I thought myself in paradise And wondered when she too had died. And then I seen the stripÃ¨d light That struggled past the prison bar, And in an instant, at the sight, My sinking soul fell just as far As could a star Loosed by a jar From out the setting in the ringâ The purpled, semi-circled ring That seems to circle us at night. She seen my senses had returned, Then swift to press my pallid faceâ Then as if spurned She sudden turned Her sweet face to the prison wall; Her bosom roseâher hot tears fell Fast, as drip moss-stones in a well, And then, as if subduing all In one strong struggle of the soul, Be what they were of vows or fears, With kisses and hot scalding tears, There in that deadly, loathsome place, She bathed my bleached and bloodless face. I was so weak I could not speak, Or press my thin lips to her cheek, I only looked my wish to share The secret of her presence there. âThen looking through her falling hairâ A look of tenderest despairâ Still sadderâso her sweet face still appears Seen through the tears And blood of yearsâ Than burning Sappho bathed in tears, She pressed her finger to her lipsâ Sweeter than sweets the brown bee sipsâ Sadder than a grief untoldâ Stiller than the milk-white moon, She turned away, I heard unfold An iron door, and she was gone. âIf all could die who death invite, And all could live who seek to live, 'Twere doubtful if the world would give A life list greater than to-night. V. Again I felt the liquid air. Around my hot brow circling roll Sweet as my Saint Madonna's prayer, Or benedictions on the soul. Pure air, which God gives free to all, Again I breathed without controlâ Pure air, that man would fain enthralâ God's air, which man hath seized and sold Unto his fellow-man for gold. âI bowed bown to the bended skyâ I tossed my two thin hands on highâ I called unto the crooked moonâ I shouted to the shining stars, With breath and rapture uncontrolled, Like some wild schoolboy loosed at noon, Or comrade coming from the wars, Hailing his companeers of old. âShort time for shouting or delayâ The cock is shrill, the east is gray, Pursuit is made, I must away. They cast me on a sinewy steed, And bid me look to girth and guide, A caution that is little need. I dash the iron in his sideâ Swift as a shooting-star I rideâ I turnâI see, to my dismay, A silent rider at my side. I glance againâit is my brideâ My loveâmy lifeârides at my side. By gulch and gorge and brake and all, Swift as the shining meteors fall, We fly, and never sound or word But ringing mustang hoofs is heard, And limbs of steel and lungs of steam Could not be stronger than theirs seem. Grandly as some joyous dream, League on league, and hour on hour, Far from keen pursuit, or power Of sheriff, bailiff, high or low, Into the bristling hills we go. Into the snowy-haired McCloud, White as the foldings of a shroud; We dash into the dashing streamâ We breast the tideâwe drop the reinâ We clutch the streaming, tangled mane; Yet the silent rider at my side Has never a sound or word replied. Out in its foamâits snowâits roarâ Breasting away to the farther shore, Steadilyâbravelyâgained at lastâ Gainedâwhere never a dastard foe Has dared to comeâor friend to go. Pursuit is baffled and danger passed. âUnder an oak whose wide arms were Lifting aloft as if in prayerâ Under an oak, where the shining moon Like feathered snow in winter noon, Quivered, sifted, and drifted down Over the dewy, dappled ground; And yet she was as silent still, A black stones toppled from the hillâ Great basalt blocks that near us layâ And I in silence sat on one, And she stood gazing far awayâ Massive, squared, and chiselled stone, Like columns that had toppled down From temple dome or tower crown Along some drifted, silent way Of desolate and desert town Built by the children of the sun. And through the leaves the silver moon Fell sifting down in silver bars And played upon her raven hair, And darted through like shooting-stars That dance through all the night's sweet noon To echoes of an unseen choir. âI sought to catch her to my breast And charm her from her silent moodâ She shrank as if a beamâa breathâ Then silently before me stoodâ Stillâcoldlyâas the kiss of death. Her face was darker than a pallâ Her presence was so grandly tall, I would have started from the stone Where I sat gazing up at her, As from a form to earth unknown, Had I possessed the power to stir. ââO touch me notâno moreâno more, 'Tis pastâand my sweet dream is o'er. Impure! Impure! Impure!â she cried, In words so sweetly, weirdly wildâ Like mingling of a rippling tide, And music on the waters spilled. âPollution foul is on my limbs, And poison lingers on my lips. My red heart sickensâhot head swimsâ I burn unto my finger-tips. But you are free. Fly! Fly alone. Yes, you will win another brideâ Will win you name, and place, and powerâ And ne'er recall this faceâthis hourâ Save in some secret, deep regret, Which I forgive and you'll forgetâ In some far clime where nought is known Of all that you have done or seen, Or dearly loved, or madly lost, Or what your life this night has cost. Your destiny will lead you on Where opened wide to welcome you Rich gushing hearts and bosoms are, And snowy arms, more purely fair, And breastsâwho dare say breasts more true When all this dear night's deeds are done? ââThey said you had deserted meâ Had rued you of your wood and wild. I knewâI knew it could not be. I trusted as a trusting child, I crossed the bristled mountain high That curves its rough back to the sky, I rode the white-maned mountain flood, And tracked, and tracked the trackless wood. The good God led me, as before, And brought me to your prison-door. I heard you in the midnight call My name in my own mountain tongue. And yet you called so feebly wild, I should' mistook you for a child, Had I not known that name and tone From all that earth has ever known. ââThat maddened call, that fevered moan, In that sweet mountain tongue and tone, So thrilled my sympathetic soul, My senses I could not control. The keeper with his clinking-keys I sought, implored upon my knees That I might see you, touch your hand, Your brow, or speak but one low word Of comfort in your dying hour. His red face shone, his redder eyes Were like the fire of the skies. He cried, but yield to my demand And you may hold his maddened head Until his latest breath is sped. Again I heard your feeble moan, I cried, And must he die alone? I cried unto a heart of stone, He knew he held me in his power. ââAh! why the burning horrors tell? Enough! I crept into your cell Polluted, loathed, a hated thing, An ashen fruit, a poisoned spring. ââI nursed you, lured you back to life, And when you woke and called me wife And love; with pale lips rife, With love, and feeble loveliness, I turned away, I hid my face In mad reproach and deep distressâ In dust down in that loathsome place. ââAnd then I vowed a solemn vow That you should liveâlive and be freeâ And you have livedâare free, now; But as for me, Too slow the red sun comes to see My life or death, or me again. O, the peril! The deep pain I have endured; the dark stain That I have took on my free soulâ All, all to save youâmake you free.â The foul broad hands that here have pressed, The drunken lips that mine caressed Were more than mortal could endure. But death and fire can make all pure. ââAnd yet I have not one regret For all I suffered, or may yet Endure or do in this dear night. Since you have lived and now are freeâ Since I have lured you back to life, And led you safely in your flight. And now in this, my last adieuâ The last act earth shall know of meâ I ask but this alone of you, That you believe, ah! know me trueâ Know all that I have done, or do Is done alone for love and you. ââBehold this finished funeral pyre, All ready for the form and fire, Which these, my own hands, did prepare For this last night; then lay me there. I would not hide me from my God, Or the gloom, or grandeur of the place Beneath the cold and sullen sod, As if I would conceal my face In fear or shame for evil done; Nor in a gloomy bed of clay Would I with reptiles rot away, But in a fiery, shining shroud Ascend to God, a wreathing cloud At once, and glad as gala day.â âShe stoppedâshe stoodâshe leaned apace Her glance and half-regretting face, As if to yield herself to me, And then she criedââIt cannot be, For I have vowed a solemn vow, O God! help me to keep it now.â âI sprang, with arms extended wide, To catch her to my burning breast. She caught a dagger from her side And plunged it to its silver hilt Into her hot and bursting heart, And falling in my arms she cried: âYes, you may kiss me now,â and diedâ Died as my soul to hers was pressedâ Died as I held her to my breastâ Died without one word or moanâ Died without a tear, or tone Save this, âYes, you may kiss me now.â Fearfully she had kept her vow. VI. âBut why the dreary tale prolong, Since she, its life and light, is gone? And deem you I confessed me wrong? That I did bend an oily knee, O'er all the deep wrongs done to me? That I, because the prison mould Was on my brow, and all its chill Which made my very heart's core cold, Still quivered in my feeble frame? Because I burst their earthly hell, And rose again to life and light, Did curb my free-born mountain will And sacrifice my sense of right? Forget my wrongs? Forget that cell That rendered me to death and shame? Did ask them to forgive a youth, Whose very goddess had been truth, Until their persecutions came And set his inmost soul aflame? âNo! and had they come to me that day While I with hands and garments red Stood by her pleading, gory clay, The one lone watcher by my dead, With cross hilt dagger in my hand Still dripping red from her heart's core That gushed my reeking garments o'erâ The every black hound of the land, Who wore a badge or claimed command, And offered me my life and all Of titles, gold, or power, or placeâ I should have spat them in the face And spurned them every one. âIt may be well, wise priest, and good, In common life, to pardon those Who have been e'en our deadliest foes, But there be wrongs that even bloodâ Heart's blood cannot effaceâ More than deathâmore than disgraceâ And he who would such things forgive I deem a cringing, coward slaveâ Calling his cowardiceâthe knaveâ Forgiveness and sweet Christian grace. Poor wretch! too base to live. âI laid my dead upon the pile, And standing 'neath the lisping oak I watched the columns of dark smoke Embrace her red lips with a smile Of frenzied fierceness. Then there came A gleaming column of red flame And grew a grander monument Above her nameless noble mould, Than ever bronze or marble lent To king or conqueror of old. âIt seized her in its hot embrace And leapt as if to reach the stars. Then looking up I seen a face So saintly and so sweetly fairâ So pitying and so pureâ I near forgot the prison-bars, And for one instantâone aloneâ I felt I could forgiveâendure. âI laid a circlet of white stone, And left her ashes resting there; But when had passed one long decade I stood beneath that scarred oak's shade And marked the circle of white stone With tall wild grasses overgrown, I did expect, I know not why, From out her sacred dust, to find Wild pinks and daisies blooming fair; And when I did not find them there, I almost deemed her God unkindâ Less careful of her dust than I. âAnd when the red shafts of the sun Came tipping down to where I stood, I hailed them with a redder oneâ A lifted dagger red with blood. I vowed to dedicate my breath To vengeance for disgrace and death. I would not cease upon the fall Of him who wrought the burning shame Of her disgrace or my dark name, No; they should perish one and all. What! he the base bruteâhe alone For such a life as hers atone? Had all his kind been heaped in one And offered me to curse or kill, I might have said, enough is done, My hate is sated to the fill. âI knew their names and faces wellâ Their numbersâknew where each did dwellâ They would have filled the vaults of hellâ Did fill them to the last degreeâ Do fill them still, if what you tell, Is truth, of faith of Pharisee. VII. âGo search the annals of the North, And records there of many a wail, Of widow and of waiting wifeâ Of marshalling and going forth, For missing sheriffs, and for men Who never more were known again, Who disappeared on mountain trail, Or in some dense and narrow vale. âGo speak to Trinity and Scott, That curve their dark backs to the sun, Go ask them all. Lo! have they not The chronicles of my wild life?â My secrets on their lips of stone?â And archives built of human bone? Go court their wilds as I have done, From snowy crests to sleeping vales, And you will find on every one Enough to swell a thousand tales. âThe soul cannot survive alone, And hate will die, like other thingsâ I felt an ebbing in my rageâ I hungered for the sound of oneâ Just one familiar word.â Yearned but to hear my fellow speak, Or sound of woman's mellow tone, As beats the wild imprisoned bird, That long nor kind, nor mate has heard, With bleeding wings And panting beak Against its iron cage. âFar, far below, at shut of day, A-glinting in the tinted ray, I seen a low-roofed cottage layâ Seen children sporting to and froâ The busy housewife come and go, And white cows come at her command, And none looked larger than my hand. The sight I could no more withstand, But worn and torn, and tanned and brown, Heedless of all, I hastened down. A wanderer wandering long and late, I stood before the rustic gate. âTwo little girls, with brown feet bare, And tangled, tossing, yellow hair, Played on the long thick coat of green Around a great Newfoundland brute, That lay half resting on his breast, And with his red mouth opened wide, Would make believe that he would bite, As they assailed him left and right, And then sprang to the other side, And filled with shouts the willing air. O sweeter far than lyre or lute To my then parched and thirsty heart, And better self, so wholly mute, Were those sweet voices calling there. Though some sweet scenes my life has seenâ Some melody my soul has heardâ No song of nymphâor maidâor bird, Or gorgeous, melting, tropic scene, Has my imprisoned soul so stirred, Or thrilled my every partâ Or filled me with such sweet delight, As those young angels sporting there. âThe dog arose at sight of me, And with a noble dignity Stood by the children now so still, And staring at me with a will. âCome in, come in,â the farmer cried, As busily the housewife hied, And here a topâa dollâa chair She placed in order and repairâ âSit down, sit down, you travelled late. What news of politics or war? And are you tired? go you far? And where' you from? Be quick, my Kate, This man is sure in need of food.â The little children close by stood, And watched and gazed inquiringly, Then came and climbed upon my knee. ââThat there's my ma,â the youngest said; And laughed and tossed her pretty head, And then, half bating of her joyâ âHave you a ma? you stranger boy? Have you, like me, a pretty home? A pretty doll, and top, or toy? Where do you live? and whither roam? And where's your pa, poor stranger boy?â âI ate with thanks the frugal foodâ The first returned for many a day. I sought my couch, but not to sleep, New thoughts were coursing strong and deep In my impulsive, passion heart. I had met kindness by the wayâ I had at last encountered good. âI lay and pictured me a life Afar from cold reproach or stain, Or annals dark of blood and strifeâ From deadly perils or heart pain, And ere the breaking of the morn I hung my arms upon the horn, And such sweet thoughts and pictures bore Instead. And from that cottage-door I passed to other scenes and lands With lightened heart and whitened hands. VIII. âI had traversed the world of woe. My boy-life had seen more of tearsâ Had felt more deep enduring painâ More desolate and deadly pain, Than tempered man can ever know, Though they should live a thousand years. âAnother placeâpursuitâand friendsâ I sought to make the world amends. Never was Christian more devout, Never was lowlier heart than mine, Never has pious Moslem yet When bearded Muezza's holy shout Echoed afar from minaret, Knelt lowlier down to saint or shrine, Than knelt that penitent heart of mine In humblest prayer for grace divine. And fortune, friends, and fame, and name, Were coming surely to be mine, Instead, reproach, pursuit, and shame; And I do know unto this hour, If it was in the Eternal power To crush me, or to make them less, 'Twas not for want of thankfulness. â'Twas by some chance I chanced to meet Some strangers on the thronging street Who stopped, and stared, and glared at meâ Then passedârepassedâthen glared again. I heard them mutter, âYes, 'tis he!â âDeath hath not a darker nightâ Hell hath not a hotter flame Or deadlier blight Than half-hid whisperings of shame. What could I do? I knew my sin. Fly as I had fled before? The heart shoots tendrils like a vine If all is warm and well within, And they will clasp and intertwine With all that's beautiful and pure When planted 'neath a genial sun. âAn exile! Can the heart endure To be thus torn from loved and pure?â To drift out on life's lonely brine? It can be done. It can endure, And die, as dies a tender vine When torn from all its tendrils twine. âHumblest penitent never yet Bowed him down in such deep regret. I bowed for days in the deepest shame, And then a courage, as from above, Into my soul-sick spirit came Breathing a calm; and the holiest love Was mine; and rising renewed, I said: Can men not pardon one man's fall Since Christ so willingly pardons all? Will the world not welcome one penitent Again to the walks of good intent, Since heaven so gladly welcomes all? I will liveâI will teach by word and deed That man may fall from the laws and creedâ May fall as far as the angels fell, Hurled from heaven to the depths of hell, And yet, when tears of penance flow, Be washed as fair as the falling snow. I will prove to the world that it may be done And open the door to many a oneâ Fair frail daughter and faltering sonâ Waiting, weeping at the cold world's doorâ Yearning to be welcomed back once more. I will bear their tauntsâI will bow in tearsâ In dust and ashes for years and years, Typing from Him of humblest birth, I will meet reproach with the lowliest love, And open the door for the fallen on earth, And open the gates for myself above. IX. âHave I not wrought while others slept? Have I not jeers and insults bore From cold, coarse men who felt no more, Than street dogs prowling at your heels? While others joyed, have I not wept? And felt all that a convict feels Who tugs eternal at his chain And peers into elysian fields? O! the dull, dead, endless pain! Deep in the dust have I not laid A thin white face all stained in tears, And in the ashes bowed and prayed In sackcloth; lo! for years and years? It was too much. Across my brow Grew lines, as furrowed by a plow. I fancied I could see a trace Of prison mould upon my face, And thought the grief-worn facial scars Resembled my cold prison bars. I thought each low uncertain word A taunt at me spoke loud and plainâ I fancied each new voice I heard Recalled me to my cell again. At night I started from my sleep, From sounds as of a sullen chain, And felt the prison coldness creep Like icicles through every vein. âSome things must pass on unexplainedâ The lead lie grinding in the coreâ The iron rusting in the soulâ Corrodingâeatingâevermore, And you must bear and yet be stillâ Though it be eating in to killâ Like old Prometheus chained. âAt last, when I had borne for years Ten thousand more than here is told, One day a dog with flippant jeers Asked me, what of the prison mould, And half the town did cheer him on. They cheeredâthey thought him grand and brave, They shouted me a coward knave. It was too muchâwith one fierce thrust I stretched him dying in the dust, And drove the taunting crowd before Like chaff along a threshing-floor. âWith one stroke I had cut the cord That bound me to that place abhorred, And nought was left me but to fly. Where orange-blossoms never dieâ Where red fruits ripen all the year, Beneath a sweet and balmy sky. Far from my language or my landâ Reproach or loveâor shame or fearâ I swiftly fledâI wandered hereâ Yes, hereâand this red, bony hand That holds this glass of ruddy cheerââ â'Tis he,â cried the tawny advocate, His red eye snapping with hope and hateâ In a voice as shrill as a cock, and as loudâ â'Tis the renegade of the cold McCloud, Seize himâO haste youâhold him fastâ Vengeance is sweetâit is mine at last.â Slowly the alcalde rose and spoke, As the advocate quailed 'neath his glare, âHand meâtouch meâhe who dareââ And his heavy glass on the board of oak He smote with such an almighty stroke, It ground to dust in his bony hand, And heavy bottles did clink and tip As if an earthquake was in the land. He towered up, and in his ire Seemed taller than a church's spire. He gazed a moment, and then, the while An icy cold and defiant smile Did curve his thin and his livid lip, He turned on his heelâhe strode through the hall, Grand as a godâso grandly tall, He passed him out through the yielding door Into the night, and he passed alone, And never was seen or heard of more. ULTIME. âAh! who can tell how hard it is to climb The steep where fame's proud temple shines afar? Ah! who can tell how many a soul sublime Has felt the influence of a malignant star, And waged with fortune an eternal war; Checked by the scoff of pride, by envy's frown, And poverty's unconquerable bar, In life's low vale remote has pined alone, Then drooped into the grave, unpitied and unknown?â âBeattie's Minstrel. They tell me, ere the maple-leaves grow brown once more, And the wild deer don their great overcoats of gray, That I must cross the stony threshold of death's door, And leave this body like a pair of overalls worn a day Outside the hall, or hung on some nail out of the way. It seems odd, and yet I think, yea do know, I do feel As little fear as any trodden dust, or dull cold clay, To hear my Doc., Death's clerk, and attorney for my weal, Say I am convicted and that there is no appeal. Yet, while I have no fear, I feel a touch of deep regretâ Regrets that burn like red-hot iron in the soul, That my day is but begun as my sun is set. But there was that in my young life I could not control. And now, to-night, as recollections o'er me roll, I know no time that I loitered by the way; But with a proud eye fixed on a lofty goal, Pressed on, nor stopped, or turned aside a single day To rest, or toy with aught that in my rough route lay. And yet one time, but one, I do remember well, My life's way lay by oaks, and talking streams, and flowers; And there were birds, and singing bees, and a holy spell Of dreamy wonder in the air and hallowed hours; And from afar fair maids did beckon from their bowers. I looked and loved. But lo! the leprous stain Of penury, that so much of life's sweetness sours, Was mine, and I pushed on in peril and deep pain, Saying, Sweet scenes, when fame is mine we meet again. Toiling for ever, chasing a phantom hope to earn A place with men of mind and a moment's peace; With the fevered soul on fire with thoughts that burn; And revelling in rainbow beauties that I could not seize, Or subdue, or reduce to shape or words; and these Did unfit me for the stormy struggle with the real. Vibrating like some insect pendent in the breeze Between these varied visions and my worldly weal I have gained neither the real nor the sweet ideal. Quoting Seneca, who wrote on his desk of gold: Dear sir! what is the use of wealth? you naively say. Sir! in your life's craft with its well-stocked hold, Your money is the white oak planks that lay Between you and the howling waves; these away, And you are in the sea without friends or a pretence, Then keep your head above the water if you may. Besides, the days of Diogenes are over now, and hence Philosophers in tubs are kept at the State's expense. None have known me, nor have I myself the least part known Until prisoned here by him of the sable shore Till he can transport me to quarters of his own. Here I have reflected and ran my fierce life o'er. Ah! truly, much indeed have I to deplore, Yet not one single act of malicious ill. I meant well in all. Who could have done more? And have I not tamed my hot and imperious will? Have I not made my impulsive heart be still? so still! Why have I been pursued in this small, low way; Why have I been crossed in my every honest aim; From my childhood on, even down to this dark day? I claimed not much of men, and less, far less, of fame. Was it because I could not, or that I would not, tame And tone my cloud-born soul in suppliance to bow Me down to dolts, and knaves, and clowns, that did proclaim Them wise, and great, and good? Ah! even yet I trow My spirit lives. I would not, could not, I will not now. âKnow thyself!â What had I to do with strife and war? I smote, then held him to my heart and wept until he died. And did I fear? this deep facial arrow's scar, And a list of lesser ones have aye the thought belied, And yet I do remember me I have turned aside To avoid the hart I had sought the whole day long. And why in stormy courts have I so zealous plied, And plead, dark-browed, and hurled invective strong, Then wept at night to think I might have done some wrong? âKnow thyself!â Had I known less of strife and flint-like menâ Had I been content to live on the leafy borders of the scene Communing with the neglected dwellers of the the fern-grown glen, And glorious storm-stained peaks, with cloud-knit sheen, And sullen iron brows, and belts of boundless green, A peaceful, flowery path, content, I might have trod, And carolled melodies that perchance might have been Read with love and a sweet delight. But I kiss the rod. I have done as best I knew. The rest is with my God. Come forward here to me, ye who have a fear of death, Come down, far down, even to the dark waves' rim, And take my hand, and feel my calm, low breath How peaceful all! How still and sweet! The sight is dim, And dreamy as a distant sea. And melodies do swim Around us here as a far-off vesper's holy hymn. This is death. With folded hands I wait and welcome him; And yet a few, so few, were kind, I would live and be known, That their sweet deeds might be bread on the waters thrown. I go, I know not where, but know I will not die, And know I will be gainer going to that somewhere; For in that hereafter, afar beyond the bended sky, Bread and butter will not figure in the bill of fare, Nor will the soul be judged by what the flesh may wear. But with all my time my own, once in the dapple skies, I will collect my fancies now floating in the air And arrange them, a jewel set, that in a show-case lies And when you come will show you them in a sweet surprise. It was my boy-ambition to be read beyond the brine, But this you know was when life looked fair and tall, Erewhile this occidental rim was my dream's confine, And now at last I make no claim to be read at all, And write with this wild hope, and e'en that is small, That when the last pick-axe lies rusting in the ravine, And its green bent hill-sides echo the shepherd's call, Some curious wight will thumb this through, saying, âWell, I ween He was not a poet, but yet, and yet, he might have been.â Above all on this green earth a grumbler I do despise, Pouring o'er all a sea of tears and untimely groans, As if he alone had stood upon the bridge of sighs; And yet I wail. But mind you my murmurs and low moans, (Not heard till I am gone) are not of you, or Smith, or Jones, But fate. Good folks. The world the best I ever trod. Yet lapidaries tell of flaws in the fairest stones, And maybe after all, my crosses, my losses, and the rod, Are but rounds in a ladder leading me thus soon to God. But to conclude. Do not stick me down in the cold wet mud, As if I wished to hide, or was ashamed of what I had done, Or my friends wanted to plant me like an Irish spud. No, when this the first short quarter of my life is run, Let me ascend in clouds of smoke up to the sun. And as for these lines they are a rough, wild-wood boquet, Plucked from my mountains in the dusk of life, as one Without taste or time to select, or put in good array, Grasps at once rose, leaf, briar, on the brink, and hastes away.</field>
