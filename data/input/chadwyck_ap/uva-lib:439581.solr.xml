      <field name="fulltext">âThe precious music of the heart.ââ Wordsworth. THE VIGIL IN AIDEN. âTrue Love is the mother of true Virtue. She is the child of Heaven, and leads to Heaven.ââ Jacobs. âIt is, indeed, a proof of boundless love, That thou hadst need of me even in thy bliss. I go with thee.ââ Fool's Tragedy. âI go to prepare a place for you.ââ John. xiv. 2. [I.] In the Rosy Bowers of Aiden, With her ruby-lips love-laden, Dwelt the mild, the modest Maiden Whom Politian called Lenore. As the churches, with their whiteness, Clothe the earth, with her uprightness Clothed she now his soul with brightness, Breathing out her heart's love-lore; For her lily-limbs so tender, Like the Moon in her own splendor, Seemed all earthly things to render Bright as Eden was of Yore. As the Morning Moon, when stricken By the God of Day, will sicken, Withering quite as Day doth quickenâ Faded now the Moon Lenore! For she said to him, when dying, On the bed where she was lying, Breathing out her soul in sighing, âKiss thy dying lost Lenore!â Then he cried out broken-hearted, In this desert-world deserted, Though she had not yet departedâ âAre we not to meet, dear Maiden! In the Rosy Bowers of Aiden, As we did in Days of Yore?â And that modest, mild, sweet Maiden, In the Rosy Bowers of Aiden, With her lily-lips love-laden, Answered, âYes! forever more!â And the old-time Towers of Aiden Echoed, âYes! forever more!â II. Round his neck her arm now placing, Lovely Death with Life embracing, Heavenly Death the earthly gracingâ She to him her soul did pourâ âLove! remember our first meeting! O! forget not this last greeting! This request my soul repeatingâ Kiss thy dying lost Lenore! Take this ringâit was the token Of thy vows to me first spokenâ Let those vows remain unbroken, Locked within thy heart's deep core! Should you ever love another, Love her only as her brotherâ Or as we shall one another When we meet on that bright shore! From the Flowery Fields Elysian I will come to thee, Politian! In some heavenly midnight vision, As I did in Days of Yore!â Then he cried out broken-hearted, Though she had not yet departed, In this desert-world desertedâ âAre we not to meet, dear Maiden! In the Rosy Bowers of Aiden, As we did in Days of Yore?â And that modest, mild, sweet Maiden, In the Rosy Bowers of Aiden, With her lily-lips love-laden, Answered, âYes! forever more!â And the old-time Towers of Aiden Echoed, âYes! forever more!â III. Oh! the plaintive sweet beseeching Of those lips that Death was bleaching, All his inmost soul now reaching, Reaching into his heart's core! Such as heavenly Joy might borrow From her earthly sister Sorrow, Should she promise her to-morrow Joys as bright as those of Yore. Then with his whole soul he kissed herâ As an Angel, or his sisterâ And, in God's great name, he blest her, Weeping out his heart's deep gore! Like the half-grown Moon declining, Through the clouds around her shining, On her dying bed reclining, Lay the Angel-Moon Lenore! Then her mother cried, âMy Daughter!â As from earth the Angels caught herâ She had passed the Stygian water On the Asphodelian shore! Then he cried out broken-hearted, For the best beloved departedâ In this desert-world desertedâ âAre we not to meet, dear Maiden! In the Rosy Bowers of Aiden, As we did in days of Yore?â And the voice of that sweet Maiden, From the Rosy Bowers of Aiden, As with deep grief overladen, Answered, âNeverânever more!â And the old-time Towers of Aiden Echoed, âNeverânever more!â IV. Then, beside the silent river, Where he wandered still forever, By her lonely grave that ever Seemed to Heaven the only doorâ Through the amethystine morning Came foul Lucifer returning Up from Hell, where he was burningâ This Elysian chant to pourâ âWhen the world was crucifying Jesus Christ, when he was dying, Shaking Heaven with his loud crying, While his soul dropt tears of goreâ From the Flowery Fields Elysian Saints returned in deep derisionâ Bursting graves to see the Vision, Such as none had seen before! Hell itself grew broken-heartedâ Wailed aloud for the departed! Even the sun now seemed deserted, From the sackcloth that he wore! Then I cried out broken-heartedâ In this desert-world desertedâ Ever true to the Departedâ âAre we not to meet, dear Maiden! In the Rosy Bowers of Aiden, As we did in days of Yore?â And Religion, that sweet Maiden, In the Rosy Bowers of Aiden, With her lily-lips love-laden, Answered, âNeverânever more!â And the old-time Towers of Aiden Echoed, âNeverânever more!â V. âFrom his bright incarnate Temple Earth's great iron hoof did trample Back his soul to God, as sample Of the sin that grieved him sore! When, all glorified, ascending, Heaven to meet him now descending, Flights of Angels on him tending, Shouting âGod!â as they did soar! Those ambrosial Truths revealing Down the echoing stars high wheeling, In empyreal thunders pealing, Crashing, crumbling on Time's shore! Tearing Hell's dark throne asunder, Filling all the world with wonder, Underneath the crushing thunder Of his lightning-Truths of Yore! Flooding all the wide Creation With their joyful Jubilation, Poured in blissful evocation, Till the world was flooded o'er! Then I cried out broken-heartedâ Ever true to the Departedâ In this desert-world desertedâ âAre we not to meet, dear Maiden! In the Rosy Bowers of Aiden, As we did in Days of Yore?â And Religion, that sweet Maiden, In the Rosy Bowers of Aiden, With her lily-lips love-laden, Answered, âNeverânever more!â And the old time Towers of Aiden Echoed, âNeverânever more!â VI. âThus from Earth now agonizing, In his sun-like chariot rising, All the stars in Heaven surprising With eclipse as they did soarâ Now like Paradise-Islands gleaming, In the far-off ether beaming, Floods of glory on them streaming Down from Heaven's eternal shoreâ To that God-built City blazing, Rapturous thundershouts upraising, Pouring out their souls, in praising, To the God they did adoreâ While each glorified Immortal Thronged the blazing golden Portalâ Filling Salem's great high court all, There to meet their Lord once moreâ On the wings of Angels soaring, Rose the God they were adoring, To his Father him restoring, Where he sat enthroned before! Then I cried out broken-heartedâ Ever true to the Departedâ In this desert-world desertedâ âAre we not to meet, dear Maiden! In the Rosy Bowers of Aiden, As we did in Days of Yore?â And Religion, that sweet Maiden, In the Rosy Bowers of Aiden, With her lily-lips love-laden, Answered, âNeverânever more!â And the old-time Towers of Aiden Echoed, âNeverânever more!ââ VII. Then, beside the silent river, Where he waited still forever, By her lonely grave that ever Seemed to Heaven the only doorâ A white Swan, all heavenly-gifted, Like to living snow uplifted, On her saintly pinions drifted, Came her dying song to pour! Like the crescent moon sedately, On some cloudless night, all stately, Or, as on her couch lay lately The incarnate Moon Lenoreâ Breathing out her soul in silence For the Heaven-uplifted Highlands Of the floating argent Islands Sailing now her soul beforeâ Floated now this argent Naid, As in Heaven would float some Pleiad, In the hyaline embayÃ¨d, Anchored near him on the shore. Then he cried out broken-heartedâ Ever true to the departedâ In this desert-world desertedâ âAre we not to meet, dear Maiden! In the Rosy Bowers of Aiden, As we did in Days of Yore?â And the voice of that sweet Maiden, From the Jasper Reeds of Aiden, With her lily-lips love-laden, Answered, âYes! forever more!â And the old-time Towers of Aiden Echoed, âYes! forever more!â VIII. Like pure living Pearl she floated, Looking now like one devoted Unto death, which she denoted By the aspect that she wore; When his soul with her delighted, For the loss of one benightedâ Wishing now to be requitedâ Ventured near her on the shoreâ Where the willow wept above her On the stream which seemed to love her, For the soul that now did move her Was the love of his Lenoreâ As this silver shining Vesper, In among the Reeds of Jasper, Wailed aloud for her sweet Hesper Who to Heaven had gone before! For this heavenly-sweet Madonna, In the Bowers of Chalcedony, Used the plaintive voice of Cona Her Elysian chant to pour. Then he cried out broken-heartedâ In this desert-world desertedâ Ever true to the departedâ âAre we not to meet, dear Maiden! In the Rosy Bowers of Aiden As we did in Days of Yore?â And the voice of that sweet Maiden, From the emerald groves of Aiden, With her lily-lips love-laden, Answered, âYes! forever more!â And the old-time Towers of Aiden Echoed, âYes, forever more!â IX. Then he asked her in his sorrow, âWill you come to me to-morrow, That my soul may solace borrow For the loss of my Lenore? I will tell you all the story Of the Maiden now in gloryâ For my soul is very sorry! Will you stay beside this shore?â When, her pearly bosom panting, His request in silence granting, As if what he wished was wantingâ Her Elysian chant did pour In such deep melodious thunder That his grief was torn asunderâ All his soul was filled with wonder, Such as Man ne'er felt beforeâ Pouring out her soul, in sighing, To persuade him from relying On the Demon who was trying To seduce him from Lenore. Then he cried out joyful-heartedâ Feeling now no more desertedâ Ever true to the departedâ âAre we not to meet, dear Maiden! In the Rosy Bowers of Aiden, As we did in Days of Yore?â And the voice of that sweet Maiden, From the Jasper Groves of Aiden, With her lily-lips love-laden, Answered, âYes! forever more!â And the old-time Towers of Aiden Echoed, âYes! forever more!â X. Then, like living snow uplifted, Like an Angel heavenly-gifted, She again through Heaven was drifted On the saintly wings she wore, Her sweet Seraph-song down-pouring On his thirsting soul, upsoaring In such Angel-like adoring, That the world seemed flooded o'erâ Rivers of deep song outwelling From her saintly soul, foretelling To Politianâher own knellingâ The return of Days of Yoreâ Lofty piles of echoing thunder, Filling all the sky Heaven underâ Drowning all the stars with wonderâ Burthened with the name Lenore! Till her joyful jubilation Died in echoes through creationâ Leaving him in desolationâ Darkerâdeeper than before! Then he cried out broken-hearted, In this desert-world desertedâ Ever true to the departedâ âAre we not to meet, dear Maiden! In the Rosy Bowers of Aiden, As we did in Days of Yore?â And the lips of that damned Demon, Like the Syren to the Seamen, Sir Thomas Brown says, âWhat song the Syrens sung, or what name Achilles assumed when he hid himself among the women, though puzzling questions, are not beyond all conjecture.â âThe Syrens were Sea Nymphs, who charmed so much with their melodious voice, that all forgot their employments to listen with more attention, and, at last, died from want of food. They were three in number, called Parthenope, Ligeia, and Leucosia; and they usually lived on a small Island near Cape Polorus, in Sicily.â With the voice of his dear Leman, Answered, âNeverânever more!â And the old-time Towers of Aiden Echoed, âNeverânever more!â XI. Then, beside the silent river, Where he wandered still forever, By her lonely grave that ever Seemed to Heaven the only doorâ Praying God to be forgivenâ In the twilight of the evenâ Suddenly there came from Heaven, Dressed in saintly white, Lenore! Like some saintly lily blowing, In its fiery perfume glowing, Light-invested, now bestowing On the Night its radiant loreâ This sweet Angel-Moon so tender, Happy now his soul to render, Clothed in Heaven's divinest splendor, Came to shine on earth's dark shore. Seeing now the long-departed, Quickly from the grave he started, Crying out now joyful-heartedâ âGod of Heaven! is this Lenore? Are we not to dwell, dear Maiden! In the Rosy Bowers of Aiden, With our souls all overladen With the joys that were of Yore?â And that glorified sweet Maiden, From the Heavenly Bowers of Aiden, With her lily-lips love-laden, Answered, âYes! forever more!â And the God-built Towers of Aiden Echoed, âYes! forever more!â XII. Then he fell on earth before her, On his knees there to adore herâ Praying God now to restore her, As she was in Days of Yoreâ When she said to him, âPolitian! Thou hast seen the heavenly Vision! In the Flowery Fields Elysian Angels wait for thy Lenore! Many Winters, many Summers, Joys like this have been kept from usâ I have now fulfilled my promiseâ Oft fulfilled on earth before! I have prayed for thy dear spiritâ Thou shalt Heaven above inheritâ Those rewards which thou dost meritâ For the good kept aye in store. I have prayed for thee in Heavenâ All thy sins are now forgivenâ Thou art pardonedâthou art shrivenâ O! forget not thy Lenore!â Then he cried out joyful-heartedâ Never more to feel desertedâ As if they had never partedâ âAre we not to meet, dear Maiden! In the Heavenly Bowers of Aiden, On the Asphodelian shore?â And that glorified sweet Maiden, From the Heavenly Bowers of Aiden, With her lily-lips love-laden, Answered, âYes! forever more!â And the God-built Towers of Aiden Echoed, âYes! forever more!â XIII. âGod has now the day appointed When thy soul shall be anointedâ By the Angels they are countedâ All thy days on this dark shore. O! be happy, I entreat thee! I will come again to meet theeâ Sister Angels, too, shall greet theeâ Crying, Rise with thy Lenore! Through the luminiferous Gihon, Gihon is one of the four rivers which watered the Garden of Eden. I have made use of it here as signifying the Ether. In an old book which I bought some years ago, entitled âThe True Knowledge of God and Man,â I find the following remarkable sentence: âThe first part, or river, is Pison, which compasseth the whole land of Havillah. This is the universal Spirit which causes every thing to grow. It is the element of fire, which produces precious gold, not only that of this earth, but particularly the red sulpher of the sunâof Man; and Bdellium; and also the transparent stone Onyx, the outside of which shines like gold, but its inside is ([Hebrew]) Shaumayim. The second part, or river, is Gihon. This is the air, which derives, or is derived, from the fire, and is the fourth day's work. It compasses (not only the whole land of the Moors, but) this whole Chus, or dry Earth. The third is called Hiddekel, and goeth (not towards the Assyrian land, but) towards the East. Now, this East is the Sun. This Hiddekel, as the word signifies, is this very Earth itself. The fourth is the Euphrates. This means all waters together, to refresh again this whole burnt up Chus, or Earth!â To the Golden City high on High Eternity's Mount Zion, God-built in the Days of Yoreâ To the Golden Land of Goshen, Far beyond Time's upper ocean, âIt was imagined by some of the Ancients that there is an ethereal ocean above us, and that the sun and moon are two floating luminous islands, in which the spirits of the blest reside. Accordingly we find that the word ??????? was sometimes synonymous with ???, and death was not unfrequently called ???????? ?????, or the passage of the ocean.â Where, beholding our devotion, Float the argent Orbs all o'erâ To Avillion's happy Valley, Where the breezes ever dally With the Roses in each Alleyâ There to rest forever more.â Then he cried out joyful-heartedâ Never more to feel desertedâ Happy now with the departedâ âThen we are to meet, dear Maiden! In the Heavenly Bowers of Aiden On the Asphodelian shore?â And that glorified sweet Maiden, From the Heavenly Bowers of Aiden, With her lily-lips love-laden, Answered, âYes! forever more!â And the God-built Towers of Aiden Echoed, âYes! forever more!â XIV. Then she said to him, âPolitian! Thou hast seen the Heavenly Vision! In the Flowery Fields Elysian Angels wait for thy Lenore. Soon thy burning, star-like spirit Shall the joys of Heaven inheritâ Those rewards which thou dost merit, Such as none have reaped beforeâ Where the glory-circled Sages, Living sunlights to the Ages, Golden Songs on silver pages Sing aloud on Salem's shore. But if thou wouldst live forever, Be thine own Ideal ever, And depart from Nature never, Her sweet absence to deplore!â When, with Angel-like adoring, She to Heaven again went soaringâ All his soul from Hell restoringâ There to rest forever more! Then he cried out broken-heartedâ Left again on earth desertedâ Ever true to the departedâ âAre we not to meet, dear Maiden! In the Heavenly Bowers of Aiden On the Asphodelian shore?â And the lips of that damned Demon, Like the Syren to the Seamen, With the voice of his dear Leman, Answered, âNeverânever more!â And the old-time Towers of Aiden Echoed, âNeverânever more!â XV. Then, beside the silent river Where he wandered still forever, By her lonely grave that ever Seemed to Heaven the only doorâ Came foul Lucifer returning Up from Hell again all burning, Through the amethystine morning, This infernal chant to pour: âI will lead thee, my Politian, To the Flowery Fields Elysian, Where now waits the Heavenly Vision, Such as none have seen before. There her lovely form reposes On her bed of new-blown roses, While the Angels scatter posies All that lily-form right o'er.â Then he cried out broken-heartedâ Ever true to the departedâ Left again on earth desertedâ âAre we not to meet, dear Maiden! In the Heavenly Bowers of Aiden On the Asphodelian shore?â And the lips of that damned Demon, Like the Syren to the Seamen, With the voice of his dear Leman, Answered, âNeverânever more!â And the old-time Towers of Aiden Echoed, âNeverânever more!â XVI. âI will lead thee, my Politian, To this blessed Heavenly Vision In the Flowery Fields Elysian, Such as none have seen beforeâ To the Blessed Land of Goshen, Through the world-surrounding ocean, Where the stars, in spheric motion, Music make on Heaven's bright shore. Comeânow taste this heavenly Letheâ All the stars will seem beneath theeâ Thy Lenore will then seem with thee, As she was in Days of Yore. Opening all thy inward senses, It will lift thee up in trances, Where the Angel-Excellences Sing aloud on Salem's shoreâ Through the hyaline deep Ether, Grapes of glory there to gather In the bosom of thy Father, Where now rests thy lost Lenore!â Then he cried out broken-heartedâ Ever true to the departedâ In this desert-world desertedâ âAre we not to meet, dear Maiden! In the Heavenly Bowers of Aiden On the Asphodelian shore?â And the lips of that damned Demon, Like the Syren to the Seamen, With the voice of his dear Leman, Answered, âNeverânever more!â And the old-time Towers of Aiden Echoed, âNeverânever more!â XVII. Then thus answered calm Politian: âIf thou art this great Physician, Better then thine own condition, Lifting thee from Hell's dark shore! If I find you reap the treasure Recommended in your measure, I will drink with you with pleasureâ But, kind stranger! not before! When the Truth shall hurl in terror Down to Hell the demon Error, Souls of men will then see clearerâ Clear as Adam did of yore; For, it is by living purely, That man's soul shall know as surely He shall Heaven possess securely After death forever more.â Then he looked the agonizing That he felt within him rising, For the Truth was on him seizingâ Making Hell in his heart's core! Then he cried out broken-heartedâ Ever false to the Departedâ By his own soul now desertedâ âAre we not to damn, dear Maiden! In the Rosy Bowers of Aiden, His proud soul forever more?â And the voice of that vile Maiden, From the Rosy Bowers of Aiden, With her lying lips lust-laden, Answered, âYesâforever more!â And the old-time Towers of Aiden, Echoed, âYesâforever more!â XVIII. âHopeless fiends of wrath infernal! Rise from out thy gloom eternal! Drag Politian's soul supernal Down to Hell's abyssmal shore! Hear ye not the thundrous surging Of their iron wings emerging From Hell's craggy mouth, while scourging Back the darkness as they soar? Like an earthquake crawling under This dark world in steps of thunderâ Striking kingdoms dumb with wonder! Hear ye not the wild uproar?â âLet them come!â Politian thundered, (While the Devil mutely wondered, As within himself he pondered, What great wrath he had in storeâ) âIf destruction be their pleasure, They shall have it without measure, In deep Hell to reap the treasure Thou didst reap in Days of Yore!â Then he cried out broken-heartedâ Ever false to the departedâ By his own soul still desertedâ âWhat are we to do, dear Maiden! In the Rosy Bowers of Aiden, With Politian?ânothing more?â And the voice of that frail Maiden, From the Rosy Bowers of Aiden, With her trembling lips grief-laden, Answered, âNothingânothing more!â And the old-time Towers of Aiden Echoed, âNothingânothing more!â XIX. âBack to Hell again in terror! There repent thee of thine errorâ Trying thus to make me sharer Of thy guilt to reap thy sore! Lest God's wrath around thee blazing, (All thy soulless soul amazing,) Leave theeâall thy dark throne razingâ Lightning-tortured ever more! Back to Hell again to languish Out thy future years in anguish! Say, Politian's soul did vanquish Thee, untouched by thy damned lore! Tell the Heaven-rejoicing story, That Politian's soul, before ye, Never bowed to lose the glory Kept in Heaven by his Lenore!â âThen have I most vainly striven! Baffled by the Power of Heaven! Down to Hell by Virtue driven! Down to torment doubly sore!â Thus with bitter lamentation Did the Demon of Damnation Shrink to Hell in consternation, There to wail forever more! While around the Towers of Aiden, With her own guilt over-laden, Wailed aloud the sinful Maiden, Crying, âYes! forever more!â And all Hellâthe Towers of Aidenâ Echoed, âYes! forever more!â XX. Like an Angel swiftly flying Down from Heaven to Virtue dying In her innocence, loud-crying, âGod! have mercy! me restore!â From the Golden Land of Goshen, Chariot-borne, with gentle motion, Like the young Moon to the Oceanâ To Politian came Lenoreâ Holy Angels her attendingâ Singing, shouting, in descendingâ Singing of the joys unending, For Politian kept in storeâ Crying out to him, âPolitian! See! behold the Heavenly Vision From the Flowery Fields Elysian! Rise to Heaven with thy Lenore! To that Golden City high on, High Eternity's Mount Zion, Type of that which Christ did die on, Earth's lost Eden to restore!â Then he cried out joyful-heartedâ Never more to feel desertedâ Never more to be Death-partedâ âI will go with thee, sweet Maiden! To the Heavenly Bowers of Aiden On the Asphodelian shore!â And that glorified sweet Maiden From her Chariot over Aiden, With her lily-lips love-laden, Said, âTo rest forever more!â And the Heavens, high over Aiden, EchoedââRest forever more!â XXI. Thus she came to him descending, Holy Angels her attending, Singing of the joys unending For Politian kept in store While the Seraphim all waited At the Portals congregated Of the City Golden-gated, Crying, âRise with thy Lenore!â When, from out his clayey prison Rose the soul of pure Politian, There to join the Heavenly Vision Glory-circled on the shore! And, with life immortal gifted, In her Chariot earthward drifted, On the wings he wore uplifted, Entered joyful with the four. Then, from earth, so long benighted, Glorified, redeemed, requited, In her Chariot, Angel-lighted, Soared Politian with Lenoreâ Crying out, now joyful-heartedâ Never more to feel desertedâ Never more to be Death-partedâ âWe are going now, sweet Maiden! To the Heavenly Bowers of Aiden On the Asphodelian Shore!â While that glorified sweet Maiden, Soaring up to Heavenly Aiden, With her lily-lips love-laden, Sang rejoicing ever moreâ Entering into Heavenly Aiden, There to rest forever more. THE MIGHTY DEAD. AN ELEGIAC POEM. âRequiem Ã¦ternam dona eis. Domine, et lux perpetua luceat eis.ââ Chant of the Franciscan Monks over the Dead. âMourn for the mourner and not for the dead; for he is at rest, and we in tears.ââ From an Ancient Hebrew Dirge. âThy sun shall no more go down; neither shall the moon withdraw herself; for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.ââ Bible. I. Everâforever moreâ Still upwardâonward into perfect blissâ Dove-like thy spirit soars William Henry Harrison. to find that shoreâ The Elysian-Isle of Joyâwhere happiness And life are oneâwhere man shall ever be Glorious in blissâGod-like eternally. II. Into that Far-off Landâ The Elysian-Isles of Infinite Delightâ Singing sweet anthems with that Angel-band Around God's throne, whose souls, like Stars at night, Make music while they shineâthy soul is goneâ Leaving the friends who mourn for thee alone! III. In that Serene Abodeâ The Eden-Isles of Loveâthou art at restâ Safe in the Living Paradise of Godâ Holding communion with the Heavenly Blestâ Chanting sweet Spirit-songs of rapturous praise With Heaven's high Seraphs, praising God always. IV. Swift as the rolling spheres Diffuse their circular orbit-tones on highâ Spreading till they embrace th' Eternal Years With their dilating, wave-like melodyâ Winnowing the calm, clear, interstellar airâ Does thy sweet, spiritual music spread up there. V. There, Amaranthine Flowers, Immortal, grow, which never cease to bloom; But, from the Evergreen Celestial Bowers, Feed the bright Angels with divine perfume; While, garmented with plumage ever gay, Ten thousand birds sing through Eternal Day. VI. There, Bowers of Asphodel Breathe in th' Elysian air divine perfumeâ Sweet, Sylvan Homes, where wedded spirits dwell Soon after they unite beyond the tombâ Couched upon Swan-down, where the Sylvanry Is sweeter than the Bowers of Ånoe. VII. Far, through the crystal air, Ãolian sounds are heard, forever sweet,â Caused by the harp-like boughs which vibrate there, Beneath the azure Breezes, when they meet, Soft Angels of the Spring! to bear perfume From opening flowers to Seraphs as they bloom. VIII. On every leaf that grows Beside the Living Waters, in each flower, A Song is written, which, while opening, shows An Angel's history, which, sung, gives power To those who hear to know the things to be, And see that which before they could not see. IX. The soft light of their eyes Shepherd the soul into the Folds of Bliss, Where the Green Pastures lie of Paradiseâ (As Beauty's eyes have done the soul of thisâ) Where, lamb-like, they recline beneath some tree, Listening to hear the Doves sing joyously. X. Their language, too, is softâ Continuousâflowingâlike some gentle brook At midnight singingâheard by me so oft In mine own land, when in some owlet-nook I lingered, listening to its flow at night, Beneath the Moon whose beams rained down delight. XI. There, streams forever flow, Of crystal purity, which wind among The lawny, labyrinthine aisles, where blow Unfading flowersâwhere birds, of various song, Sing, through unending Day, the Song of Love, And all that sing sing sweeter than the Dove. XII. All that could die is dead! Thy body is as senseless as the grave! But thy undying Soul to Heaven hast fledâ A spiritual bodyâChrist alone could save! A perfect being, without partsâone wholeâ Is now the nature of thy God-made soul. XIII. And that which is thus made Can never changeâan essence can not dieâ An undivided whole can never fadeâ But must endure foreverâlive on high When all that is of parts must fade away, And pass to those as subject to decay. XIV. Sorrow there can be none Where the exalted splendor of the soul Shall shine out brighter than the noonday-sun! For Death has over Spirits no control, And cannot touch Man's mind, nor mar the joy Of that which God himself will not destroy. XV. Then, what is Death?âNot even A common darkness which might here molest The soul in passing from this world to Heaven; That Valley of the Mountains of the Blest, From whose top God's immortal Son sublime Brought Truths to Man which thunder through all time. XVI. The grave is, then, the Gate Which leads up to the Portals of that King Whose House is Heavenâwhose Temple is so greatâ So wideâso loftyâhighâthat every thing Th' Immortal Soul requires is thereâdivineâ And part of every thing that is, is thine. XVII. Like Moses on the Mount Of Horeb, wonderful to look uponâ All garmented with glory from the Fount Of Godâthou didst appear, great Washington! Grasping the Parchment Scroll of Liberty, Signed by the fearless Elders of the Free. XVIII. Thou wert the Great High Priest Of Him who was the Prophet of the Freeâ Who entered, as the follower of Christ, The New Jerusalem of Liberty, And swore an oath which shook the dome of Heaven, Never to rest till England's chains were riven. XIX. As on Oblivion God laid the Corner Stone of Nature, which The Fabric of this world was reared upon, With such immeasurable grandeur rich And wonderful in gloryâso did they Their Altar, built for Liberty, that Day. XX. And in this Country vastâ This great Americaâthe Pride of Heaven! Built of the columns of the ruined Pastâ This Altar stood, where Tyrants' chains were riven, And Freedom's laws established by the Free, While offering up their hearts to Liberty. XXI. Their Orisons to pay, Gathered the Constellations of the Freeâ The Thirteen Sovereign States, who helped to lay Their great Palladium's Corner Stone, to be To Future Generations all that they, For Liberty, had sacrificed that Day. XXII. This Monumental Fane, As did the uncreated world in God'sâ Lived archetypal in the souls of men; Till, springing upward from the dim abodes Of Thought, it stood, like Nature on the Night Of Chaos, wonderfulâstar-spangledâbright! XXIII. And this is Freedom's Homeâ Adown whose sculpture-columned aisles there rollsâ (Peopling, with living Thought, the years to comeâ) Man's eloquence in thunders!âto all souls, Like an inspired Rhapsodist, sublime, Speaking Life's Cyclic Poem through all time. XXIV. David, whose harp was strung In Zion for the service of the Lord, Went up to Heaven before he died, with tongue Lisping God's holy nameâshouting that Word Which loosed the Nations from Barbarity, And made them live the Allies of the Free. XXV. That Word shall sleep no more, Until the Ocean-song of his great soul Shall waft the waves of Truth to every shoreâ Greening Man's soul with virtue as they rollâ Till all the nations of the world are taught The billowy thunder-songs of his pure thought. XXVI. And that same Principleâ Long imaged forth in words of Living Truth Upon Messiah's lipsâin quivering accents fell From our forefathers, who, in deathless youth, Planted on Plymouth's barren Rock the Tree Which bore the First Fruits of our Liberty. XXVII. This principle lived still In Nature, like the lightning in the air, Unseen, yet strongâawaiting but the will To thunderâwhen oppression was stript bareâ To utter nakednessâdebased with guiltâ Blasted with infamyâfor blood long spilt. XXVIII. Thy soul, intent to hear, Caught up the echoes of that Wondrous Voiceâ From soul to soul, as light from star to star, Rollingâtill all were radiant to rejoiceâ And through the labyrinthine aisles of earth Spread the Great Truths which now are going forth. XXIX. The troubled multitude, Like Ocean impulsed by the Whirlwind's breath, Or Hurricane, in the Autumnal wood, Gathering the scattered leaves round Summer's deathâ (As if the buried ages waked from sleepâ) Wondered that Truth so clear should be so deep! XXX. The lever once appliedâ Whose fulerum was the Rock of Agesâmoved The multitude to undulations!âwide As is the world, that Wondrous Voice reproved The guilty!âdove-winged for the years to come, It now goes forth the Future to call home. XXXI. As Genius gathers fame As Time rolls onânever to die on earthâ Till this broad world is peopled with his nameâ (Circling creation in its goings forth, Like radiance round the sunâ) so will the Truth, From Voice to Voice, live in eternal youth. XXXII. What Shiloh uttered thenâ Now eighteen hundred years agoâwhose tones Are still vibrating in the minds of men, Like lightning, in the thunder-peopled zonesâ Shaking the earth it purifiesâwhich rolls As cradled upon soundâthy soul of souls XXXIII. Re-echoed to the Land! And, whirlwind-like, upon th' opprobrious earth, Blew down Sin's Upas-tree, which dared withstand The hurricane of thought, in going forthâ As lightning from its thunder-sheath made bare, Withers the Oak it leaves forever sere. XXXIV. Up to the rolling spheres It went, mingling with star-tones, which the Days Repeated to the Monthsâthe Months to Yearsâ (As Night to Night went forth to offer praiseâ) The Years to AgesâAges to all Timeâ Time to Eternityâin tones sublime. XXXV. Ignorance, then, howling, fled Before the Light of Knowledge, as the Night Before the steps of Dayâtill, blindly led, She sank in Truth's deep seaâfar out rightâ Whose waves closed round her, as the waves around Th' Egyptian Cohorts in the Red Sea drowned!â XXXVI. That glorious Nightingale, Who sang of Life, Death, Immortality, With such celestial sweetness that the Vale Of Death ran liquid musicâWhere is he? He who was Young by name, as through all timeâ Kindling the Stars with eloquence sublime? XXXVII. Where is that tuneful Tongueâ Religion's Ciceroâwho set the soul on fire With words of immortality?âwho wrung Confession from the Atheist's lips?âthat Lyre, Whose strings were deathless thoughts, which shed Immortal music on the soul?âNot deadâ XXXVIII. Aliveâalive in Heaven! Leader of that Seraphic Host which sing God's praises through the Eden-bowers of Evenâ Drinking refreshing draughts from that sweet Spring Which flows out of God's Everlasting Sea To green the Joy-fields of Eternity. XXXIX. The thunder of his song Reverberates through all High Heaven afar, Sprinkling his genius, as it rolls along, In sweet, melodious rain, as if some star Had scattered down its spherÃ¨d song in light, Dissolving gloriously the gloom of night. XL. Like that Sorrowful Tree, âIn the Island of Goa, near Bombay, there is a singular vegetable called the Sorrowful Tree, because it only flourishes in the night. At sunset no flowers are to be seen, and yet, half an hour after, it is quite full of them. They yield a sweet smell; but the sun no sooner begins to shine upon them, than some of them fall off, and others close up, and thus it continues flowering in the night during the whole year.ââ Payne's Universal Geography. Whose blossoms only flourish in the night, Making the silence fragrant with its sea Of odorâclouding darkness with the light Of moon-lit incenseâthou didst Heaven divine With Music's love-unfolded Eglantine. XLI. Milton, that blind old âSire Of an immortal strain,â for Freedom sung, Woke up the sleeping Nations with his Lyreâ Uttering deep Truths, which died not on his tongue, Till Liberty's fierce torch, like Dragon's tongues, Had set each soul on fire to know his wrongs. XLII. That blind Republican First showed the hireling Salmasius. of Charles Stuart's Court That Liberty belonged to every Manâ That Prelacy was but the Devil's sport To damn more soulsâthat all fiducial power Was vested in the People as their Dower. XLIII. His fame shall outlive years; For as some cloud is broken into rain By lightning, her vile heart was into tears By his immortal, soul-uplifting strain, Radiant with holy love, which, from his soul, In living thunders, burst from pole to pole. XLIV. Byron, that Bird of Jove, Perched on the Andes of immortal fame, Called to the prostrate Nations from above, To rise aloft in Liberty's great name, And dash the clanking chains down from their slaves, Trampling the bones of Tyrants in their graves! XLV. Greece heard his welcome voice, And kept the famished Anarch-wolves at bay, Howling around her with obstreperous noise, Ready to tear her heart out as their preyâ And cursed the hour that ever she was given To fatten dogsâthe meanest under Heaven. XLVI. As when some mighty Crane, With outstretched wings, scourging some thunder-cloud, When chariotted by tempests from the mainâ Upborne by whirlwinds, screaming now aloud, Disturbs the stillness of the noontide airâ Was Europe by the voice of her despair! XLVII. Marco Botzarisâhe Who heard the thunder-shout afarârose up, And, by the trumpet-voice of Liberty, Swore never more to drink the bitter cup Which pledged a Tyrant's healthâwhen down it fellâ Shattered to fragments on the Rock of Hell! XLVIII. Swords of Damascus steel Gave he his hearts of oak, that Suliote Band, When they went forth at midnight, thus to deal Destruction on the Tyrants of their land! And so he died, the bravest of the brave, When Tyranny sank with him to the grave. XLIX. Oh! as the red-hot tide Gushed from his broken heart, the frightened earth Shook as when God was murdered! when he cried, England! protect us!âBut she came not forth! Noâspurned him from her unmaternal breast! When did th' Oppressor ever aid th' opprest? L. Never were mortal men More resoluteâfor they loved Freedom well, And longed to look upon her face againâ When Moslem's Hell-anointed Cohorts fell In hideous clangor round the path they trod, Like Chaos melting at the glance of God! LI. Shelly, that Human Dove, Who hymned the Dawn of Liberty with such Celestial sweetness, Angels from above Bent down to hear himâwhose ethereal touch So rained the soul of song out of his Lyre, They took him up to Heaven to lead their choirâ LII. When his loud harp was strung, His Halcyon thoughts, as when an Eagle springs, Winnowing the labyrinthine space among The starsâglinting, with his aspiring wings, Their beamsâwith lightning swiftness thundered forthâ Raining immortal music down on earth. LIII. On earth he sang of Love And Liberty Divine, which cannot die; And now enjoys the real bliss above Of his Ideal here exultinglyâ While from his Amphionic harp the beams Of melody descend through Heaven in streams. LIV. The lightning of his song Dissolves the heart of Genius into tears, As thunder shakes the worldâuntil the wrong, Which fed his soul with eloquence, appears Our own, while over what he sung we sigh, Mourning that any one so good could die! LV. And now he is in Heaven, The Israfel âThe Angel Israfel, who has the most melodious voice of all God's creatures.ââ Sale. among the Sons of Song, Like Hesperns among the Stars of Evenâ Great Shepherd, folding his Celestial Throng, With lips all honeyed with the dews of love, Into the Paradise of Bliss above. LVI. As yon bright Star of Even, Ascending, kindling in its rapid flight, Forever to endure, till in High Heaven It shines the Captain of the Host of Night; So did thy glory-circled spirit climb The Mount of Fame which overlooks all time. LVII. And there thy glorious form, In Apotheosis Divine, shall stand, The gaze of Nations, while the thunder-storm Shall sprinkle thee with lightnings, as thy hand, Spread out above the future years to-come, Shall beckon Genius to thy soul's pure home. LVIII. Thou, too, hast mourned, Sweet Dove! Felicia Hemans. But wearest the aspect of immortal youth! Thou art like Peace, begotten of Pure Love, Nursed by Religion in the Bowers of Truth, And on Ambrosia, which the months do bring, Fed by the Spirit of Perpetual Spring. LIX. Thou wert not born to die! The grave could feel no pride in burying thee! Death would not dare to look thee in the eyeâ Or, if he did, those smiles of purity, Like streams of light descending from above, Would melt his icy heart to tears of love! LX. Thy songs have been to me The bright unfoldings of that glorious hope Which blossomed in immortal bloom in thee; Whose bud was, as young Passion burst it ope, Frosted by Sorrow, which exhales perfume, Of âtender smell,â time never shall consume. LXI. A spirit-sounding sighâ An aromatic sweetness of the heart, Whose fragrant piety can never dieâ Expressed in Poetry's Divinest artâ Was thy sweet Angel-music, full of love And griefâdeeper than Earth from Heaven above. LXII. Thy love was one deep sigh Breathed from the depths of thine immortal soulâ Troubled with sorrow, which can never die, While time shall last, or Music's waters roll To grieve Man's heart with sorrow-joyâfor how Can Time affect that which delights him so? LXIII. Like that sweet Bird of Night, The Southern Mocking Bird. Startling the ebon silence from repose, Until the stars appear to burn more bright From its excessive gush of song, which flows Like some impetuous river to the seaâ So thou did'st flood the world with melody. LXIV. For, as the Evening Star Pants with its âsilver lightningsâ for the high And Holy Heavensâthe Azure Calm afarâ Climbing with labor now the bending sky, To lead Night's Navy through the upper seaâ So thou didst thirst for immortality. LXV. As underneath the sky, Sad Autumn, the Religion of the year, Mourns that her sister Spring should ever die, Whose summer-ripeness in the Fall grows sere, As beauty by the graveâso do we mourn For thee, Lost One! who never canst return!â LXVI. Shakspeare, the God of Song, Stands on the Pyramid of Sciences, Sublimely thronedâwith hand above the throng, Who come to worship him, outstretched, to bless Their pilgrimage with wisdom from his store, Whose Archives are the world's collected lore. LXVII. The ocean deep of Truth He sounded, sounded never so beforeâ Bringing up Pearls which an immortal youth Had purchased him, which he, upon Time's shore, With liberal hand, has scattered, of great price To Manâworth more than Rubies to the Wise. LXVIII. From the deep Healing Wells Of Wisdom, fathomed not by any line, Save his deep-diving thought, he plucked up Shells Of such great price that they were called Divine, And such Celestial Music made, his name, Among th' Eternal, bought immortal fame. LXIX. Wherever Thought had been, Searching on wildest wing for hidden Lore, He went, discursive, Eagle-winged, again, And better found, where others searched before, Jewels, which they had left behind, which he Bestowed on Man for Immortality. LXX. That which the World thought best, Was by his poorest bettered, till mankind Not only wondered how he was possessed Of such great knowledgeâfeasting every mind, Already fat, to fatnessâbut how men Ever had lived without him until then. LXXI. His soul was like the sea, Self-purifying, where his Thoughts, launched forth, Became the Jewel-laden Argossyâ Freighted with all the Merchandise of earthâ Which he unloaded on the Wharf of Timeâ Piling it up in Mountain-heaps sublime. LXXII. Two hundred years ago, Had he not lived, the World had been behind Two hundred yearsâthe Present knows this soâ For all was Chaos, till his God-like Mind Moved on the formless nothing of the Past, When Wisdom's World stood forth, soul-girdledâvast!â LXXIII. We heard an Angel's wings Hovering at night above thy Andrew Jackson dying bedâ Shaking sweet dews of comfort, as from strings Of gold falls song, upon thy pillowed headâ Making sweet musicâsoft as is the light Rained from the Moon upon the dark of night. LXXIV. And when thy breath was gone, We heard him soaring to the Western Star! We listened to his music, all as one, Till it was lost in silence in the air! When all grew still!âso still, that every breath Seemed stopt by that one glorious death! LXXV. We heard our own hearts beat, And each the other's answered, as we stood Listening for those dumb accents, once so sweet; And feeling for those pulsings of rich blood Whose life-imparting properties were goneâ Leaving thy heart within as cold as stone! LXXVI. Yes! thou art now at rest! The labor of thy Week of Life is done! And in the Sabbath of the skies, possessed Of an immortal joy, thou art to run No more the race of glory, for the prize Of Heaven is wonâhow dazzling to thine eyes! LXXVII. Ãons of Ãons thou Shalt live throned in thy Country's grateful heartâ Forever more divine as thou art nowâ A spirit never from her to depart; For thou art with the Truth, which thou didst love, Coupled, as God is with the Heavens above. LXXVIII. For thou wert like, on earth, That glorious Diamond âThis Diamond was found near Adrianople, among some ruins, by a Shepherd, who made use of it above a year to strike fire from to light his pipe. It was valued at more than two hundred purses.ââ A. De La Motray's Travels. which the Shepherd found, Who looked upon it as of little worth; And as its Heavenly radiance scattered round His ignorant way the whitest beams of light, So thou didst Wisdom on the World's dark night. LXXIX. Darkâmoaning in the windâ The Cypress flings its shadow on his grave, Where lies the Temple of his mighty mind, Whose glory is as bright as he was braveâ The echo of whose name is heard afarâ Far as the Eastern from the Western Star. LXXX. Never to come on earthâ Never to visit us in Time againâ A spiritual bodyâthou shalt wanton forth In endless being, righteous to remainâ A God-anointed soul to live all pure, As long as His own life-time shall endure. LXXXI. Never to come againâ Never, while earth remains what it is nowâ Nor while the sunbeams fall from Heaven like rain, To raise up flowers to deck her dusky brow; Nor while the Stars shall their wide Cycles rollâ Wilt thou return, great Chastener of the soul! LXXXII. We need not look for thee! Thou hast fulfilled the object of thy birth, And been on earth what thou wert made to beâ A holy manâone, who adorned the earth, And made it better than it would have been, Hadst thou not livedâthou wilt not come again! LXXXIII. No, never will thy voice Wake up the heart to ecstacies again! Nor make those who once loved thee here, rejoice That thou wert bornâwhose absence now is pain! Not through the long, long trying years to-come, Wilt thou return, to this, thy native home! LXXXIV. Farewell!âNo more on earth, Through all succeeding time, wilt thou be seen Among mankind! for thou hast had one birthâ One deathâthe mother of that birth to men Which shall not dieâfor life to Man was given That he might pass through death to life in Heaven. LXXXV. Upon the Willow-tree, Weeping above thy grave, my harp shall hangâ Silent as deathâtill taken down by me To sing again the Dead, like him who sang For Adonais, Shelley, the golden-mouthed Swan of Albion, who mourned for his beloved friend Keats, in an Elegy entitled âAdonais.â The following beautiful lines, from the glorious Petrarch, are truly applicable to him: âIn nobil sangue, vita umile e queta, Ed in alto intelletto un puro core; Frutto senile in sul giovenil fiore, E in aspetto pensoso, unima lieta.â whom the World did wrong, With the swift thunders of his Orphic Song. AVALON. âI will open my dark saying upon the Harp.ââ David. âAll thy waves and billows are gone over me. I sink in deep mire where there is no standing!ââ Psalms. âThere be tears of perfect moan Wept for thee in Helicon.ââ Milton. I. Death's pale cold orb has turned to an eclipse My Son of Love! The worms are feeding on thy lily-lips, My milk-white Dove! Pale purple tinges thy soft finger-tips! While nectar thy pure soul in glory sips, As Death's cold frost mine own forever nips! Where thou art lying Beside the beautiful undying In the valley of the pausing of the Moon, Oh! Avalon! my son! my son! II. Wake up, oh! Avalon! my son! my son! And come from Death! Heave off the clod that lies so heavy on Thy breast beneath In that cold grave, my more than Precious One! And come to me! for I am here aloneâ With none to comfort me!âmy hopes are gone Where thou art lying Beside the beautiful undying In the Valley of the pausing of the Moon, Oh! Avalon! my son! my son! III. Forever more must I, on this damp sod, Renew and keep My Covenant of Sorrows with my God, And weep, weep, weep! Writhing in pain beneath Death's iron rod! Till I shall go to that Divine Abodeâ Treading the path that thy dear feet have trodâ Where thou art lying Beside the beautiful undying In the Valley of the pausing of the Moon, Oh! Avalon! my son! my son! IV. Oh! precious Saviour! gracious heavenly Lord! Refresh my soul! Here, with the healings of thy heavenly Word, Make my heart whole! My little Lambs are scattered now abroad In Death's dark Valley, where they bleat unheard! Dear Shepherd! give their Shepherd his reward Where they are lying Beside the beautiful undying In the Valley of the pausing of the Moon, With Avalon! my son! my son! V. For thou didst tread with fire-ensandaled feet, Star-crowned, forgiven, The burning diapason of the stars so sweet, To God in Heaven! And, walking on the sapphire-paven street, Didst take upon the highest Sill thy seatâ Waiting in glory there my soul to meet, When I am lying Beside the beautiful undying In the Valley of the pausing of the Moon, Oh! Avalon! my son! my son! VI. Thou wert my Micro-Uranos belowâ My Little Heaven! My Micro-Cosmos in this world of wo, From morn till even! A living Lyre of God who charmed me so With thy sweet songs, that I did seem to go Out of this world where thou art shining now, But without lying Beside the beautiful undying In the Valley of the pausing of the Moon, Oh! Avalon! my son! my son! VII. Thou wert my son of Melody alway, Oh! Child Divine! Whose golden radiance filled the world with Day! For thou didst shine A lustrous Diadem of Song for aye, Whose Divertisments, through Heaven's Holyday, Now ravish Angel's earsâas well they mayâ While I am crying Beside the beautiful undying In the Valley of the pausing of the Moon, Oh! Avalon! my son! my son! VIII. Thy soul did soar up to the Gates of God, Oh! Lark-like Child! And through Heaven's Bowers of Bliss, by Angels trod, Poured Wood-notes wild! In emulation of that Bird, which stood, In solemn silence, listening to thy flood Of golden Melody deluge the wood Where thou art lying Beside the beautiful undying In the Valley of the pausing of the Moon, Oh! Avalon! my son! my son! IX. Throughout the Spring-time of Eternity, Oh! Avalon! PÃ¦ans of thy selectest melody Pour forth, dear Son! Clapping thy snow-white hands incessantly, Amid Heaven's Bowers of Bliss in ecstasyâ The odor of thy song inviting me Where thou art lying Beside the beautiful undying In the Valley of the pausing of the Moon, Oh! Avalon! my son! my son! X. The redolent quintessence of thy tongue, Oh! Avalon! Embowered by Angels Heaven's sweet Bowers amongâ Many in oneâ Is gathered from the choicest of the throng, In an Ãonian Hymn forever young, Thou Philomelian Eclecticist of Song! While I am sighing Beside the beautiful undying In the Valley of the pausing of the Moon, For Avalon! my son! my son! XI. Here lies dear Florence with her golden hair, And violet eyes; Whom God, because she was for earth too fair, Took to the skies! With whom my Zilly only could compareâ Or Eugene Percy, who was debonair, And rivaled each in every thing most rare! These now are lying Beside the beautiful undying In the Valley of the pausing of the Moon, With Avalon! my son! my son! XII. Her eyes were like two Violets bathed in dew From morn till evenâ The modest Myrtle's blossom-Angel blue, And full of Heaven. Up to the golden gates of God she flew, To grow in glory as on earth she grew, Heaven's own primeval joys again to viewâ While I am crying Beside the beautiful undying In the Valley of the pausing of the Moon, Oh! Avalon! my son! my son! XIII. The Violet of her soul-suffused eyes Was like that flower Which blows its purple trumpet at the skies For Dawn's first hourâ The Morning-glory at the first sunrise, Nipt by Death's frost with all her glorious dyes! For Florence rests where my dear Lily liesâ Where thou art lying Beside the beautiful undying In the Valley of the pausing of the Moon, Oh! Avalon! my son! my son! XIV. Four little Angels killed by one cold Death To make God glad! Four Cherubs gone to God, the best he hathâ And all I had! Taken together, as if in His wrath, While walking, singing, on Hope's flowery pathâ Breathing out gladness at each odorous breathâ Now they are lying Beside the beautiful undying In the Valley of the pausing of the Moon, Oh! Avalon! my son! my son! XV. Thou wert like Taleisin, Taleisin, the Druidical High Priest, or Bard. Ezekiel, in describing the great knowledge of the Cherubim, says, that they were âfull of eyesâ âfull of eyes,â Bardling of Love! My beautiful Divine Eumenides! My gentle Dove! Thou silver Swan of Golden Elegies! Whose Mendelsohnian Songs now fill the skies! While I am weeping where my Lily lies! Where thou art lying Beside the beautiful undying In the Valley of the pausing of the Moon, Oh! Avalon! my son! my son! XVI. Kindling the high-uplifted stars at even With thy sweet song, The Angels, on the Sapphire Sills of Heaven, In rapturous throng, Melted to milder meekness, with the Seven Bright Lamps of God to glory given, Leant down to hear thy voice roll up the leven, Where thou art lying Beside the beautiful undying In the valley of the pausing of the Moon, Oh! Avalon! my son! my son! XVII. Can any thing that Christ has ever said, Make my heart whole? Can less than bringing back the early dead, Restore my soul? No! this alone can make my Heavenly breadâ Christ's Bread of Life brought down from Heaven, instead Of this sad Song, on which my soul has fed, Where thou art lying Beside the beautiful undying In the Valley of the pausing of the Moon, Oh! Avalon! my son! my son! XVIII. Have I not need to weep from Morn till Even, Far bitterer tears Than cruel Earth, the unforgiven, Through his long yearsâ Inquisitorial Hell, or strictest Heaven, Wrung from Christ's bleeding heart when riven? Thus from one grief unto another driven, Where thou art lying Beside the beautiful undying In the Valley of the pausing of the Moon, Oh! Avalon! my son! my son! XIX. Yes! I have need to weep, to groan, to cry, And never faint, Till, battering down God's Golden Gates on high, With my complaint, I soften His great heart to make reply, By sending my dear son from Heaven on highâ Or causing me in this dark grave to lie, Where thou art lying Beside the beautiful undying In the Valley of the pausing of the Moon, Oh! Avalon! my son! my son! XX. I see the Bridegroom of the Heavenly Bride, In robes of light! My little Ones now stand his form beside, In linen white! Embowered by Angels, star-crowned, in their pride, Singing Ãonian songs in joyful tideâ Although much larger grown than when they diedâ While I am sighing Beside the beautiful undying In the Valley of the pausing of the Moon, Oh! Avalon! my son! my son! THE LUSIAD. âSi je te perds, je suis perdue.ââ From a Cameo. I. On the banks of Talapoosa, Long time ago, Where it mingles with the Coosa, Southward to flowâ Dwelt the Maid I love, sweet Lucy! Lucy, long time agoâ Bringing Heaven to earth, sweet Lucy! Lucy, long time ago. Ah! who now can know How I loved the Maid, sweet Lucy! Lucy, long time ago. II. Like the black wings of the Raven In the sun's glow, On her neck, from morn till even, Whiter than snow, Like fresh lilies born in Heavenâ Flowed her locks lowâ (For they never had been shavenâ) Long time ago. Ah! who now can know How I loved the Maid, sweet Lucy! Lucy, long time ago. III. Like the blue-eyed Morning-Glory When it doth blow At the skies to tell the story Of the sun's glow In the East when it is hoaryâ (Gladdening to knowâ) Were her blue eyesâever sorry Is my soul now! For, ah! who can know How I loved the Maid, sweet Lucy! Lucy, long time ago. IV. Pure as when the Virgin Mary First came to know That her heart was born to carry Christ here belowâ Who was neither sad nor merryâ Lucy looked nowâ (Like the North Star not to varyâ) Long time ago. Ah! who now can know How I loved the Maid, sweet Lucy! Lucy, long time ago. V. Like the plaintive voice, in Summer, Of the Dove, low, When her melting heart doth murmur Accents of wo For the mate that is torn from herâ (Golden in flowâ) Were the words of my sweet Lucy, Lucy, long time ago. Ah! who now can know How I loved the Maid, sweet Lucy! Lucy, long time ago. VI. Like the young Fawn in the Valley, Seeking the Doe, On the banks of Oostanalla, Gone with her Roeâ Came she down the Emerald Alley, Warbling words low, Singing when she talked, sweet Lucy! Lucy, long time ago. Ah! who now can know How I loved the Maid, sweet Lucy! Lucy, long time ago. VII. Like two roses ever blowing, Hued as they blow, Were her bright cheeks ever glowing In her soul's glowâ As if Heaven were now bestowing All she did know Of herself on my sweet Lucy, Lucy, long time ago. Ah! who now can know How I loved the Maid, sweet Lucy! Lucy, long time ago. VIII. In the sweet time that was floral, With her lips soâ She this Eonch of sweet Coral Loudly did blow. Now Heaven's never-fading laurel Crowneth her brow, Where she went to dwell, sweet Lucy! Lucy, long time ago. Ah! soon you will know Why I loved the Maid, sweet Lucy! Lucy, long time ago. IX. In the May-Moon, when I sought her Freely to know, From the acromatic water, Ruby-tinct, low, Did this Dian, Heaven's sweet Daughter, Bring to me now This sweet Eonch, which I taught her Loudly to blow. Ah! now you can know Why I loved the Maid, sweet Lucy! Lucy, long time ago. X. I was then her Triton truly, Truly as nowâ This sweet Eonch, then so newly Found here below In the stream that flowed on coolly, Freely to blow, And reveal to Heaven as duly All I did know Of the charms of my sweet Lucy, Lucy, long time ago. In words white as snow Flowed the soul of my sweet Lucy, Lucy, long time ago. XI. In the mild month of October, As we did go Through the Fields of Cooly Rauber, No one can know, But the great Archangel Auber, What songs did flowâ (Bringing Heaven to earth to robe her In light like snowâ) From the lips of my sweet Lucy, Lucy, long time ago. Ah! now you can know Why I loved the Maid, sweet Lucy! Lucy, long time ago. XII. Like the young bud of the Tulip, Half hid in snow, Just disparting of its blue lipâ Looked her eyes now, When I kissed the nectared julep From her lips soâ Blushing with my bashful Lucy, Lucy, long time ago. Ah! who now can know How I loved the Maid, sweet Lucy! Lucy, long time ago. XIII. Then from out the East low looming, Earthward, but slow, A dark thunder-cloud came booming, Loud as the flow Of ten thousand oceans spooming, Breaking below Over mighty rocks, entombing People in wo! Ah! who now can know How I feared for my sweet Lucy, Lucy, long time ago. XIV. Then the lightning fell in flashes, Laying her low! Burning up her robes to ashesâ Leaving me so! While her soul stood there as fresh as The new-fallen snowâ A white Dove from out the meshes Of the world's woâ Ready made for Heaven, sweet Lucy! Lucy, long time ago. Ah! who now can know How I prayed for my sweet Lucy, Lucy, long time ago. XV. Round her form of beauty glowing, Glorified so, Angel-robes of light were flowing, Whiter than snow, All her radiant beauty showing Unto me nowâ Heaven's own joys on her bestowingâ On meâdeep wo! Ah! now you can know Why I mourned for my sweet Lucy, Lucy, long time ago. XVI. Then from out the depths of Heaven, Glorious in glow, By an Angel's hand down-drivenâ (Horses of snowâ) A bright Chariot left the levin, Coming belowâ Bearing back to God sweet Lucy, Lucy, long time ago. Ah! now you can know Why I mourned for my sweet Lucy, Lucy, long time ago. XVII. On the banks of Talapoosa, Free from all wo, Where it mingles with the Coosa, Southward to flowâ Rests my beautiful sweet Lucy In her grave low! Taking Heaven from earth, sweet Lucy! Lucy, long time ago. Ah! now you can know Why I mourned for my sweet Lucy, Lucy, long time ago. XVIII. Weeping willows bend above her, Where she lies low! As if each one were her lover Burthened with wo! Guardian Angels sent to hover Over her now, As if striving to discover What none can know But the one that loved sweet Lucy, Lucy, long time ago. Ah! now you can know How I loved the Maid, sweet Lucy! Lucy, long time ago. ISABEL; BALLAD OF LOVE âThe modest maid decked with the blush of honor, Whose feet did tread green paths of youth and love.ââ Daniel. I. Saintly lilies mixed with roses Were thy cheeks, dear Isabel! Where my memory now reposesâ Fare-thee-well! Like the Dawn when it is snowing, Was thy lily-breast to me, On my soul its sweets bestowing, Full of loveâfarewell to thee! II. Sorrow neverâalways pleasure Thou didst give me, Isabel!

Thou didst look the agonizing Felt, I thought, by none but me, When thy heart in tears gushed rising To thine eyesâfarewell to thee! VII. Then in one long trance of feeling, Deep as Heaven, dear Isabel! All our loveâour griefârevealingâ Fare-thee-well! There we clungâhad clung forever, Had not Hope thus whispered meâ Thus to part is not to severâ Both are oneâfarewell to thee! VIII. Lonely, like the first-sent Raven From the Ark, dear Isabel! Wandered we from our soul's Havenâ Fare-thee-well! Then like our first parents driven Out of Eden, so were weâ Having now no home but Heavenâ So we wentâfarewell to thee! IX. Though our bodies here are partedâ Mine from thine, dear Isabel!

Sweeter far than our first meeting Here on earth, dear Isabel! Shall be our eternal greetingâ Fare-thee-well! Parted is not disunitedâ Severed we can never beâ Thus in grief we are requited By our loveâfarewell to thee XIII. Flowery Islands stud the river Where we met, dear Isabel! There our aspen lips did quiverâ âFare-thee-well!â Nightly through the months of Summer, Keeping tryste, dear love! for me, Thou didst wait to hear me murmur My true loveâfarewell to thee! XIV. But you dared not show your sorrow To your friends, dear Isabel! Nor from Hope one solace borrowâ Fare-thee-well! When they told thee I had perished, But to win thy soul from me, All thy precious hopes, long cherished, Died awayâfarewell to thee! XV. All the solace you could borrow For your grief, dear Isabel! Was to wail aloud in sorrowâ âFare-thee-well!â From the rosy river-Islands Thou didst swim at night to see If, by moonlight, on the Highlands, I had diedâfarewell to thee! XVI. On the name of thy true lover Thou didst call, dear Isabel! But thou couldst not him discoverâ Fare-thee-well! There thy violet-eyes, all clouded With their tears, did seem to see On the ground thy lover shroudedâ Lying deadâfarewell to thee! XVII. Wailing thus his name, distracted, Every night, dear Isabel! Friends were to the spot attractedâ Fare-thee-well! There they found thy body lying On the ground, when, suddenly, Up they saw thy spirit flying Into Heavenâfarewell to thee! XVIII. There thy body still kept lying On the ground, dear Isabel! While thy soul soared upward cryingâ âFare-thee-well!â For thy voice grew shriller, shriller, Soaring up to Heaven for me; Then, at length, grew stillerâstillerâ Silent nowâfarewell to thee! XIX. Every night they hear the wailing Of thy voice, dear Isabel! All their future grief foretellingâ Fare-thee-well! Still pursuedâforever flyingâ Nothing of thy form they see; But they hear the bitter crying Of thy soulâfarewell to thee! XX. Nightly, through the months of Summer, Thou dost come, dear Isabel!

Listening, rapt with wonder, sighing, For the Voice, dear Isabel! I beheld an angel flyingâ Fare-thee-well! It was thy dear, Heavenly Spirit Coming down to say to me, âThou shalt Heaven above inherit After Deathââfarewell to thee! AGNUS; OR, THE LITTLE PET LAMB. A PASTORAL. âFeed my Lambs.ââ Christ's Charge to Peter. I. I never shall forget the day I went to see sweet Alice Grayâ The little lamb that lived half way To Heaven aboveâthe child of May. For near the path that led me by The Plumtrees, on the ground did lie A little lamb whose child-like cry Told it had wandered there to die. II. Its mother wandering from the fold When it was only three days old, Was found upon the open wold, Deadâdying of the bitter cold. All day along the deep ravine, Beside the rill that rolled between Two sloping hills of emerald green, Its little tiny tracks were seen. III. All night upon the emerald moss That did the old gray rocks emboss, Beside the stream it could not crossâ It lay lamenting its great loss! In pale cold swoon, with dew bedight, Low in the Moon's soft arms of light, This lily lay in beauty bright Snowing her whiteness on the night. IV. For as the little dappled Fawn, Out of the lily-jeweled lawn, At daybreak, eyes the milky Swan Floating upon the Lake at dawnâ So did she from the emerald lea Of this dark life gaze silently At lambs beneath the Big Oak tree, Sporting in joyful jubilee. V. Thus all day long adown the Vale Vocal with her eternal wail, She wandered sighing out her tale Upon the suckle-scented gale. Sometimes amid the verdant bowers, Attended by the joyful Hours, She scattered dew from off the flowers Down on her limbs in pearly showers. VI. Thus orphaned on the dewy mead, Self-exiled in her utmost need, A weary, weary life indeed Did she among the lilies lead At noontide, with the wild Gazelles, Amid the flowery Asphodels, She learnt to drink from dewy wells That fountained in the lily-bells. VII. The Fawn may seek the mountain Doeâ Down from the Hills may leap the Roe To where the saintly lilies blow All night upon the Vales below; The amorous Doe may come again Back to the Isles of Jasper Cane; But for her mother, Death has slain, She all night long shall wait in vain! VIII. For three long months in bitter cold, With child-like plaint, it meekly told Its sorrows to the snowy fold That fleeced all night the open wold. At midnight by the purling rill That carolled down the echoing Hill, She heard the plaintive Whippoorwill Beg to be whiptâkeeps begging still. IX. I took it from the place it lay, And bore it to sweet Alice Grayâ The little Lamb that lived half way To Heaven aboveâthe Child of May. It never, from the first, was wild, But followed her like some sweet child, With artless innocence so mild, As meek as it was undefiled. X. Then in an ocean of green wheat I placed it, that it there might eat, Where, wading with its snowy feet, Its happiness seemed now complete. But how I loved that little lamb, That played at evening in the calm With Alice on sweet beds of balmâ Is only known to the I Am. XI. Although it lived till it was grown, Its fellows it would never ownâ Forgetting not the kindness shown To it by me when left alone. One day, I turned it out to see If it would keep the company Of other lambsâwhen, instantly, It left them, running back to me. XII. Thus, humanized, it drew content From those that Nature never meant To be its partners, when she sent It in this world where life is spent. For never, till its dying day, Did it the full-grown sheep betray; It was so like sweet Alice Gray, Its lambhood never passed away. XIII. One day, to please the love divine Of my dear sister Adalineâ Whose spirit now in Heaven doth shine! I made her, out of new white-pine, A little waggon with four wheels, And, harnessing the lamb, with peals Of laughter ringing at my heels, I drove her all about the fields. XIV. The sheep, with heads uplifted, stared, As if they thought it were too hard To be from freedom thus debarredâ Pulling her all about the yard. Thus did I while the time away With my dear little Alice Grayâ The little Lamb that lived half way To Heaven aboveâthe Child of May. XV. When it got hungry, as is so With little lambs on earth belowâ I made my little brother go And steal some breadâhis name was Joe. So, when my joy was most complete, I called it from the field of wheat; It ran to me with silver feet, As if it did its mother meet. XVI. And while it stood there by my side, A rope around its neck I tied, Expecting soon, with joyful pride, To take my sister out to ride. Then, rubbing it upon the head, Thus to myself I softly said, âWait till I get some crumbs of breadââ When I got back, the lamb was dead! XVII. The cord got tangled round its neck While it was tethered to the stake: Finding it never more would wake, I thought my very heart would break! I buried it deep in the clay, And went to tell sweet Alice Gray; The little Lamb that lived half way To Heaven aboveâcried all that day. TO CECILIA.

The April-shower of thy soft music fell Soft on the Summer of my listening ears, Like Anthems from the lips of Israfel, âThe Angel Israfel, who has the most melodious voice of all God's creatures.ââ Sale's Koran. When all in Heaven are gathered round in tears. II. Sweet as the last vibration of those Bells âTo these delights will be added the music of golden bells, shaken, as they hang upon the Trees of Eden, by odoriferous winds from the throne of God; the charms of which will be swollen and diversified by the clashing of the golden-bodied Trees, whose fruits are Pearls and Emeralds.ââ Foster's Arabian Nights. Upon the Trees of God, just as it dies, Fast by the throne where the Eternal dwellsâ Were the last echoes of thy melodies. III. And now thy heavenly beauty steals upon My spirit rapt with such divine delight, As when the Moon to young Endymion Revealed herself in visions of the night. IV. Like mellow moonlight in the month of June, Waning serenely on some far-off sea, Died the soft pathos of that spiritual tuneâ Soft as the liquid hues Alluding to the harmony between a soft sound and a blue color. of Heaven to me. LORD UTHER'S LAMENT FOR ELLA. I. When the milky moon hung crescent, Like young Grief when Joy is present, Joy, whose life is evanescentâ On the horizon's rim, low, lowâ From the Vale of Cuscovilla, Through the Bowers of Boscobella, Came to meet me Angel-Ella In the days of long ago. II. By her side Cherubic Aster, With white limbs like alabaster, Circled through Heaven's azure pasture, Half the fields of night to mow, When her heart to mine was givenâ Then she sang to me at even Golden melodies of Heaven In the days of long ago. III. Pure as snow on Himalaya Was this beautiful bright Bayaâ The Baya is a beautiful bird of Hindostan, about the Sparrow's size, with yellow-brown, soft plumage, yellow head and feet, with breast light colored. In Malabar, it is called the Olimara; in Sanscrit, Barbere; and in Bengalee, Babin. It is a great favorite with the lovers of Hindostan, who send it forth to pick the jewels from their mistress' brows. It is here used as a name of endearment by Lord Uther. Bayadere of old Allaya Whom the world could never know; For within the Boscobella Boscobella, from two Italian words, signifies beautiful Woods, or Woodlands. It was the Eden-wilderness of the Golden Villa of Don Allaya, whose orchards, which were diversified with all kinds of the most delicious fruits, were more beautiful than the delightful gardens of King Alcinous. His Villa was called Bella Vista, or Beautiful View. It was called Golden, because it contained the trophies brought by the Spanish buccaneers from the Southern seas to old St. Louis' Fort in Florida, which were recaptured from them when overrun by the savage myrmidons of the great chiefs from the North. These treasures, which consisted of the richest gold and silver plate, corals, pearls, and ermine of the costliest kind, were bequeathed to Don Allaya by old Lamorah, the principal chief of the Northern tribes, on his death-bed. From the names engraven upon each plate, it was evident that they were the pride of Spanish Kings. Of the Vale of Cuscovilla, The Vale of Cuscovilla was to the River Mobile what Val-Ombrosa is to the Arno in Italy. Cuscovilla was the Holy City of the Southern tribes. It was in this valley that Boscobella, the Beautiful Bower of the villa of Don Allaya, was situated. Died the Sire of Angel-Ella In the days of long ago. IV. In the mild month of October, Through the fields of Cooly Rauber, By the great Archangel Auber, Such sweet songs of love did flow, From her golden lips preluded, That my soul with joy was flooded, As by God the earth was wooded In the days of long ago. V. All her soul's divinest treasure Poured she out then without measure, Till an ocean of deep pleasure Drowned my soul from all its wo; Like Cecilia Inatella, In the Bowers of Boscobella, Sang the saintly Angel-Ella In the days of long ago. VI. In the Violet Valley lying Dwells the beautiful undying, While my soul is left here sighing That I, too, cannot be so; For an angel's chariot driven Through the parting clouds of Heaven, Bore her soul to God, forgiven In the days of long ago. VII. Through the shades of Death low looming, Where the pale night-flowers are blooming, Goes the brass-winged beetle booming, Making silence doubly so; While my soul is left in sorrow, Waiting for the bright to-morrowâ Solace none from Hope to borrowâ For the days of long ago. VIII. He who mourns the loved-departed, Weeps for those who are desertedâ Who in Heaven live broken-hearted For the lost left here below; There, they live in joyful sadness, Waiting, with exultant madness, For the left-behind lost gladness Of the days of long ago. IX. In the Orient Isles of Morning, Whence there is no more returning, Thy pure spirit now is burning With the stars' serenest glow; While, as Abraham mourned for Sarah, By the cypress wells of Marah, Marah means bitterness. When the Israelites came to the Waters of Marah, in the wilderness of Shur, they could not drink of them because they were bitter, whereupon Moses âcried unto the Lord, and he showed him a tree, which, when he had cast it into the waters, the waters were made sweet.â I now mourn in life's Saharah For the days of long ago. X. Where the moon hangs never crescentâ (Though she made our nights so pleasant)â Where God's face is ever present, But where tears can never flow; In the golden Boscobella Of the Heavenly Cuscovilla Waits to meet me Angel-Ella, As in days of long ago. XI. On the green grass, passemented With the Eden-flowers, sweet scented, There she sits in Heaven, contented, With the Cherubs on the snow Of the flowers around them springingâ Angels nectar to them bringingâ Ever shining, ever singing Of the days of long ago. XII. By her side Cherubic Aster, With white limbs like alabaster, Plays along Heaven's emerald pastureâ Ganymede of joy belowâ While her saintly soul sings PÃ¦ans In the Amaranthine Ãons Of high Heaven with her dear Fleance, Of the days of long ago. XIII. Soon my sighing soul shall follow Her from this dark grave we hallow, Up to God's Divine Valhalla, There to sing forever mo In the Bowers of Chalcedony Of the Heavenly Avalona, The Vale of Avalon, where King Arthur, the son of Uther, was wounded. It was the valley of the pausing of the Moon. With the plaintive voice of Cona, Conaâone of the most beautiful of the female characters of Ossian. Of the days of long ago. TO MARY IN HEAVEN. I. I met thee first in May, Mary! The flower-crowned month of May; But now thou art away, Mary! Away from meâaway! Thou wert that all to me, Mary! That all on earth to me, That I will be to thee, Mary! In Heaven above to thee. II. Ah! then thine eyes were mild, Mary! Thy deep blue eyes were mild; For thou wert then a child, Mary! And I another child. Thou wert that all to me, Mary! That all on earth to me, That I will be to thee, Mary! In Heaven above to thee. III. Thy face was then so meek, Mary! So saintly mild, so meek, Thy lily-form seemed weak, Mary! And mine for thine grew weak For thou wert that to me, Mary! That all on earth to me, That I will be to thee, Mary! In Heaven above to thee. IV. You led me through the meads, Mary! The flower-enameled meads, By brooks of rustling reeds, Mary! By brooks of rustling reedsâ Where thou wert that to me, Mary! That all on earth to me, That I will be to thee, Mary! In Heaven above to thee. V. Wherever you then went, Mary! No matter where you wentâ I followed with content, Mary! Because you were content. For thou wert that to me, Mary! That all on earth to me, That I will be to thee, Mary! In Heaven above to thee. VI. I recollect the morn, Mary! The beautiful May-Morn, Beside the Field of Corn, Mary! The rustling reeds of Cornâ That thou wert that to me, Mary! That all on earth to me, That I will be to thee, Mary! In Heaven above to thee. VII. Ah! then I took thy hand, Mary! Thy lily snow-white hand; And walked along the sand, Mary! The milk-white road of sand. For thou wert that to me, Mary! That all on earth to me, That I will be to thee, Mary! In Heaven above to thee. VIII. I caught thee round the waist, Mary! The slender Sylph-like waist, And felt my heart beat fast, Mary! Because thine own beat fast. For thou wert that to me, Mary! That all on earth to me, That I will be to thee, Mary! In Heaven above to thee. IX. Such words fell from thy tongue, Mary! Such sweet words from thy tongue, That when you talked you sung, Mary! You never talked but sung. Then thou wert that to me, Mary! That all on earth to me, That I will be to thee, Mary! In Heaven above to thee. X. Thus through the month of May, Mary! The flower-crowned month of May, We, courting, went to play, Mary! And courted in our play. The years were then to me, Mary! As hours are now to me; As time is now to thee, Mary! In Heaven above to thee. XI. For Love knows nought of years, Mary! Love nothing knows of years; And sheds no bitter tears, Mary! Time measured is by tears. Thus thou wert that to me, Mary! That all on earth to me, That I will be to thee, Mary! In Heaven above to thee. XII. What thou art now above, Mary! I was, as if above; For Heaven is made of love, Mary! And I was full of love. For thou wert that to me, Mary! That all on earth to me, That I will be to thee, Mary! In Heaven above to thee. XIII. But now these days are gone, Mary! These Halcyon Days are gone! And I am left alone, Mary! Alone on earthâalone! What would I give to see, Mary! Thy precious form to see? All thou wouldst give to be, Mary! In this dark world with me. THE SHELL. âIt seems in truth the fairest shell of ocean.ââ Shelley. I. What is it makes thy sound unto my ear So mournful, Angel of the mighty Sea? Is it the soul of her who once was here, Speaking affection, through thy lips, to me? II. Oh! from my childhood this has been to me A mystery which no one could solve!âIt sounds And sorrows for the Sea incessantlyâ Telling the grief with which my soul abounds! III. Here, in its labyrinthine curve, it leaves The foot-prints of its song in many dyes; And here, incessantly, it ever weaves The rainbow-tissue of its melodies. IV. When any harsher sound disturbs me here, In my lamentings in this world for thee, I will apply it to my listening ear, And think it is thy soul come down to me. THE DYING SWAN. I. Fair as the crescent Moon supine in Heaven, Floating among the Reeds which seemed to love her, Beneath an emerald Willow, late at even, Weeping upon the River just above herâ As if the soul within was music that did move herâ II. A virgin Swan came in the time of Spring, Wrapped in the winding-sheet of her own whitenessâ Her Heaven-revealing dying Song to singâ Breasting the stream with such majestic brightness It seemed awe-struck beneath her bosom's downy lightness. III. The cataract of her song, at first, was mild, But like Ezekiel's River, wider growing, Till all the world became an ocean wildâ It gathered volume with its onward flowingâ As if her joy sprung from the bliss she was bestowing. IV. As if some Angel down from Heaven had come To sing the Great Day of the Resurrection, When all the thunder-cataracts grew dumb At his loud Gabriel-voiceâby God's direction, Opening the graves for Man to rise in every sectionâ V. Like that great Amphionic-Song of joy, Whose Mountain-moving, Titan-jubilations Built up, impregnable, the walls of Troyâ Giving to stones the heart's divine pulsationsâ While teaching Heaven's world-making tongue unto the Nationsâ VI. Her mighty, soul-uplifting melodyâ Strong as an Angel's wing rising to glory With the redeemed who died in purityâ Shouting to Angels at Heaven's Gate the story Of her release from Earth where she had long been sorryâ VII. In clarion-shouts of blissful joyance sprung Out of her heart in whirlwind-jubilationsâ Rising in fiery swiftness from her tongue, In wild, Elysian chantâas when two Nations, Like clouds do thunder, lift their Heavenward acclamations VIII. In Hallelujah-shouts for Liberty's dear sakeâ Upsent out of each lightning-soul in thunderâ As if each mighty, Titan-heart would break With its great earthquake-joyâtearing asunder The Tyrant's throneâmute now with supernatural wonder! IX. Till all the golden-tongued Pierides Upon the Olympian Mountain loudly singingâ Filling Thessalia's Vale with music to the seas, Whose storm-uplifted billows now were flinging Their tribute of rare shells upon the shore, upspringingâ X. Were hushed to silence mute as hungry Death When listening for the footsteps of the Living; Till great Poseidon held his mighty breath, The tribute of rare audience mutely givingâ Proclaiming, louder than in storms, the joy he was receiving. XI. This Niobe of Birds, rapt in Apocalypse, Deluged the world with her Seraphic wailingâ Turning the Stars in Heaven to an eclipseâ (Her joy, at length, above her grief prevailingâ) Proving that all except Grief's Song for grief is unavailing. XII. Thus did her soul pour forth its song's deep meer, In emulation of the God-like thunder Of Saturn-overturning Jupiter, Whose Heaven-usurping vengeance took with wonder The Immortal Godsâtearing their Ramparts all asunder! XIII. Like some impetuous River to the Sea, Greening the Vallies through which it goes rolling, With vital freshnessâher sweet melody, In crystal, joy-creating, grief-controlling Volume, poured through all the thirsting world its cool consoling. XIV. Then, as some Dove-like Soul on wings of fireâ (Forced from her husband twice on earth to severâ) In blazing Chariot from her funeral pyre, Ascends to Heaven unscathed, rejoicing everâ All purified, redeemed from mortal taint foreverâ XV. Swift rising on the circling wings of song, Out of her burning heart in transport soaringâ Leaving the Harp vibrating of her tongueâ So rose her soulâ(all other souls restoringâ) Up to the God in Heaven she died on earth adoring. XVI. The cloud-sustaining, many-folded Hillsâ The soft, retiring mystery of the Valliesâ The open frankness of the verdant Fieldsâ The winding labyrinths of the emerald Alleysâ The bending Heavens, with all the Stars in cyclic salliesâ XVII. The open mouths of Mountainsâthe dim Cavesâ Echoed her music with reverberant thunder, From their sepulchral throatsâdeep as the grave'sâ Dying around Night's throne now torn asunderâ Leaving the rapt World mute with supernatural wonder!â XVIII. This was the Gospel taught by that rapt Swanâ White Angel-Prophet on the waters dying! That many pleasures in this world foregone, Are but the works of our great Faith relying On Heaven for good, for which we are forever sighing. XIX. This was the great Evangel of that Swanâ That not on Earth is that Unfading Treasure For which we yearn as Night does for the Dawn; But after death we shall possess the pleasure Which God in Heaven has laid up for us without measure. ISADORE. âI approach theeâI look dauntless into thine eyes. The soul that loves can dare all things. Shadow, I defy thee, and compel.ââ Zanoni. I. While the world lay round me sleeping, I, alone, for Isadore, Patient Vigils lonely keepingâ Some one said to me while weeping, âWhy this grief forever more?â And I answered, âI am weeping For my blessed Isadore!â II. Then the Voice again said, âNever Shall thy soul see Isadore! God from thee thy love did severâ He has damned thy soul forever! Wherefore then her loss deplore? Thou shalt live in Hell forever! Heaven now holds thine Isadore! III. âShe is deadâthe world benightedâ Dark for want of Isadore! Have not all your hopes been blighted? How can you be reunited? Can mere words the dead restore? Have not all your hopes been blighted? Why then hope for Isadore?â IV. âBack to Hell, thou ghostly Horror!â Thus I cried, dear Isadore! âPhantom of remorseless Sorrow! Death might from thee palor borrowâ Borrow leanness ever more! Back to Hell again!âto-morrow I will go to Isadore!â V. âWhen my soul to Heaven is taken,â Were thy words, dear Isadore! âLet no other one awaken In thy heart, because forsaken, What was felt for me before! When my soul to Heaven is taken, Oh! forget not Isadore! VI. âOh! remember this, Politian!â Said my dying Isadore! âTill from out this clayey prison In the flowery Fields Elysian We unite forever more! Oh! remember this, Politian! And forget not Isadore!â VII. Then before my raptured vision Came sweet Hope, dear Isadore! From the flowery Fields Elysian, Crying out to me, âPolitian! Riseârejoice forever more! Angels wait for thee, Politian! Up to Heaven to Isadore!â VIII. Then from out my soul departed Deepest grief, dear Isadore! Bliss, that never me deserted, Entered in the broken-heartedâ Giving life forever moreâ Bliss that never me deserted, Like thy love, dear Isadore! IX. Myriad Voices still are crying, Day and night, dear Isadore! âCome, come to the Pure Land Plato speaks of the âPure Earthâ above, (??? ??? ??????? ?? ?????? ??????? ??????,) the abode of Divinity, of innocence, and life. It is an immemorial tradition. It was a revelation to the Hebrews. This âPure Earthâ above, is, no doubt, the primeval Paradise of Loveâthe ante-type of that which Adam lost. Aristotle, in his Hymn to Virtue, speaks of the âBlessed Islesâ above. The ????? ???????, or Isles of the Blest, were the Elysium of the departed Heroes who were considered immortalâthe same as the Manitoline of the Indians, where they say the souls of the deathless Chieftains of the world dance in hormonian choirs around the throne of Ataensic to the most delightful music. They believe that the future felicity of the departed of this world consists in rejoining, in the flower-gemmed Savannahs of the Fields of Immortality, the long lost objects of their affections in the joyful festivities of the Chase. lying Far up in the sky undyingâ There to rest forever more! Purified, redeemed, undyingâ Come to Heaven to Isadore! X. âBlest Companion of th' Eternal! Come away to Isadore! From the griefs that are diurnal To the joys that are supernalâ Sempiternal on Heaven's shore! Bliss supernal, joys eternal Up in Heaven with Isadore. XI. âCast away thy garb of mourning, Worn so long for Isadore! For those glory-garments burning In the Bright Isles of the Morning, Like the stars forever more. Golden Days are now returningâ Up to Heaven to Isadore! XII. âLay aside thy load of sorrow, Borne so long for Isadore! Pilgrim, pierced by Death's cold arrow, Thou shalt see thy love to-morrow Up in Heaven forever more! Lay aside thy load of sorrowâ Come to Heaven to Isadore! XIII. âCome away, Oh! mournful mortal! Come to Heaven to Isadore! Through Death's ebon, iron Portal To the joys that are immortal On Helusion's happy shore! Come away, Oh! mournful mortal! Into Heaven to Isadore! XIV. âUp to God who will befriend you! Up to Heaven to Isadore! Angels waiting to attend youâ Every aid you wish to lend youâ Singing, shouting on Heaven's shore! Angels waiting to attend you To your blessed Isadore!â XV. From the griefs that are diurnalâ Bitter griefs, dear Isadore! To the joys that are eternalâ To the bliss that is supernalâ Sempiternal on Heaven's shoreâ Thou art gone through years eternal There to rest, dear Isadore! XVI. There they comates shall be Angelsâ White-robed Angels, Isadore! Singing Heaven's Divine Evangels Through the Eternal Years, all change else, Changeless there forever more! Thou, Astrate of the Angels! Knowest this so, dear Isadore! XVII. From the Paradise now wasted Of thy form, dear Isadore! Lilly-bell that Death has blasted! Purest Pleasures have I tasted In the Edenic days of Yore. Joys celestial have I tasted From thy flower, dear Isadore! XVIII. Like two spirits in one being, Were our souls, dear Isadore! Every object singly seeingâ In all things, like one, agreeing In those Halcyon Days of Yore. We shall live so in our being Up in Heaven, dear Isadore! XIX. Myriad Voices still are crying Day and night, dear Isadore! âCome, come to the Pure Land lying Far up in the sky undyingâ There to rest forever more! Purified, redeemed, undyingâ Come to Heaven to Isadore! XX. Adon-Ai! God of Glory! Who dost love mine Isadore! Who didst hear her prayerful story In this world when she was sorryâ Gone to Heaven forever more! Adon-Ai! God of Glory! Take me home to Isadore! THE GOSPEL OF LOVE. âHeaven lies about us in our infancy.ââ Wordsworth. âHe that will humble himself to go to a child for instruction, will come away a wiser and a better man. Better to be driven out from among men, than to be disliked of children.ââ Charles H. Dana. I. You beat the child into distress, That you may force him to confess His faultsâthen, penitent, caress His penitential bitterness. II. You force from out his heart the tears That have been sleeping there for years, By waking not his love but fearsâ He only thus reformed appears. III. For your own heart's offended sake, Him to your arms again you takeâ Keeping his former love awake; Else, like his own, your heart would break! IV. But had you not caressed the child, Thereby becoming reconciled To him, now he is so exiledâ You had not tamed, but made more wild. V. It was your kindness was the cure, And not the pain he did endure; Else why the after-overture His former friendship to secure? VI. To punish one that does not need The punishment, is to exceed His guilt, did he deserve to bleed, By doing far the greater deed. VII. No evil underneath the sun Is greater than this very one; What tenderness at first had done, Makes after-overture just none. VIII. Why should you first withdraw your love To punish him? then, after, prove, By kindness, what it did behoove You first to do his heart to move? IX. Your after-kindness only shows That what you tried to do by blows, (Which your own heart, now melted, knows,) From acts of kindness only flows. X. Thus what you try by force to bend You only breakâthis is its end; By forcing Nature to contend, You only mar what you would mend. XI. What Nature says is right, is so: This every man on earth should know, That, feeling for another's wo, Is what we all were born to do. XII. To make the Man, build up the childâ Still keeping pure the undefiled; To tame is not to make more wild: This must be done by acts most mild. XIII. That doth the father's heart defile Which makes him to his child hostile; The vigor born of such black bile, Is evidence itself of guile. XIV. Healing the blow, that caused him pain, By after-kindness, proves it vain; For that which will not him restrain, Helps him to do the deed again. XV. The child's soul must be first imbued With principles of perfect good, Before it can be thus renewed To walk the path of rectitude XVI. The madness we can not endure, We send to Hospitals to cureâ Purging the heart to make it pure, From future ills to keep secure. XVII. A fostering kindness is the way To purge such darkness all away From that poor soul now led astrayâ Letting in Truth's eternal Day. XVIII. This law unto the soul was given When God first sent it down from Heavenâ By force no heart is bentâbut riven: Man may be ledâbut never driven. XIX. That which belongs alone to God, He has upon no man bestowed; Death-punishment, therefore, for good, Should be erased from penal code. THE GREAT REFORMER I. Like the holy men of Tabor, Bloody sweat upon his browâ Here he travailed long in laborâ His reward is with him now. II. With sublime, divine uprightness, By the lightning of his thought, Like an Angel's sword in brightness Was the World's great battle fought. III. Fired with Prophet-inspiration, Words of lightning fiercely fell From his lips of Jubilationâ Withering up the hosts of Hell! IV. Full of God's eternal Spirit, Gospel-charmed, the spirit's spell, Preaching Truth, he did inherit Heaven on earth instead of Hell. V. Thus did he fulfil his Mission, Making Earth like Heaven aboveâ Healing, like the Great Physician, Human hearts with heavenly love. VI. So his soul's Divine Hosanna Cheered Earth's children in distress, As Heaven rained on Israel manna, Journeying through the wilderness. VII. For his soul's Divine Evangels Fell so sweetly from his tongue, That his speech seemed like an Angel's, As if he in Heaven had Sung. VIII. Flower-enameled, golden-sanded Was the path on which he trod From the Pearl-shore, where he landed, To the holy House of God. EVENING. I. Out of the crystal Gates of Heaven, Now comes the pensive blue-eyed Even, Weeping like Eve, when first forgiven In penitence, from Eden driven. II. Down in the acromatic streams, Meeting the luminiferous beams With which the air forever teems, The golden mail of minnows gleams. III. Up from the blade-embattled banks Of the cool stream, the deer, in ranks, Are going now to give God thanks, By playing on the hills their pranks. IV. Over the Pastures green the lambs Go bleating round their snowy damsâ Drawing sweet comfort from the calms Along the hillside by the rams. V. The Ring-dove coos her woodnotes wild, As artless as an innocent childâ Drawing her bliss from undefiled Connubial truth in meekness mild. VI. The budding Lily yields her heart The Summer Sun now to dispart, A saintly virgin void of art, Joy to all Nature to impart. VII. Impearled in drops of beaded dew, The Violet opes her eye of blue, The pensive Nun in Heaven to view, So early crescent, born anew. VIII. Out of the red heart of the rose A liquid honey softly flowsâ The Atter-gul made as she growsâ Condensed in nectar as she blows. IX. The white Swans, in the rustling Reeds, Clamor with joy, as in the weeds The matron builds the nest she needs, While her mute mate around her feeds. X. The Red-Bird, with his coral crest, Carols aloud from out his breast, While nigh, his mate, supremely blest, Among the branches, builds her nest. KYRIE ELEISON. âDe profundis clamavi ad te Domine.â I. By the Heaven-revealing Stranger Nursed by Mary in the Manger To preserve him from all dangerâ Kyrie Eleison! Lord, have mercy. II. By the Truths that he came teaching, Which the Apostles died in preachingâ Heaven the sooner for it reachingâ Kyrie Eleison! III. By the comfort still proceeding From his Words, that all are needing, When our hearts within are bleedingâ Kyrie Eleison! IV. By the Heaven-eclipsing anguish That he suffered, Hell to vanquish, On the cross where he did languishâ Kyrie Eleison! V. By his body torn asunder, When his lightning-groans in thunder Struck the Angels dumb with wonderâ Kyrie Eleison! VI. By his golden voice when crying, âIt is finished!ââ(God replying In an earthquake)âfaintingâdyingâ Kyrie Eleison! VII. By his bounteous Benediction Breathed on earth for our affliction At his glorious resurrectionâ Kyrie Eleison! VIII. By this Lord of Light returning Back to Heaven, with glory burning In the Bright Isles of the Morningâ Kyrie Eleison! IX. By the Fountains Everlastingâ Ever flowingânever wastingâ His pure spirit now is tastingâ Kyrie Eleison! X. By the death that Stephen suffered, When his soul to God was offeredâ Gift like that which Peter profferedâ Kyrie Eleison! XI. By his soul-uplifting story, Which to read now makes me sorry,â How he âfell asleepâ in gloryâ Kyrie Eleison! XII. By the Day-spring on him breaking, From the sweet sleep he was taking By the Gates of God, when wakingâ Kyrie Eleison! XIII. By the earnest expectation Of the glorious consummation Of our hopes in Heaven's salvationâ Kyrie Eleison! XIV. By the faith of childless Hannahâ Wife of Shiloh-loved Elkanahâ (As to Israel Christ gave Mannaâ) Kyrie Eleison! XV. By his bounteous Benedictus Breathed in Heaven for our delectusâ Agnus Dei to direct usâ Kyrie Eleison! XVI. By the words that he has spokenâ Vows that never can be brokenâ Of our joys in Heaven the tokenâ Kyrie Eleison!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">BURDENS OF UNREST. MARY'S LAMENT FOR SHELLEY LOST AT SEA. âStay for me there! I will not fail To meet thee in that hollow vale!ââ Bishop Henry King âThou wilt not be consoledâI wonder not!ââ Shelley. I. I hear thy spirit calling unto me From out the deep, Like Archytas âHorace represents the spirit of Archytas addressing itself, from the Gulf of Venice, to a Mariner, earnestly requesting him to strew light sand over his body, which lay unburied on the beach.ââ Buck's Beauties and Sublimities of Nature. from old Venetia's sea, While I here weep! Saying, Come, strew my body with the sand, And bury me upon the land, the landâ Out of this sea, dear Mary! on the land, the land! II. Oh! never, never more! no, never more! Lost in the deep! Will thy sweet beauty visit this dark shore, Where I now weep! For thou art gone forevermore from me, Sweet Mariner! lost, murdered by the sea! Ulysses of my soul's deep love lost in the sea! III. Everâforevermore, bright, glorious one, Drowned in the deep! In Spring-timeâSummerâWinterâall aloneâ Must I here weep! Thou spirit of my soul! thou light of life! While thou art absent, Shelley, from thy wife! Absent, dear Swan of Albion, from thy weeping wife! IV. Celestial pleasure once to contemplate Thy power, great Deep! Possest my soul! but evermore shall hate, While I here weep! Crowd out thy memory from my soul, oh! Sea! For killing him who was so dear to me! More dear than Heaven's high Lord to Mary unto me! V. He was the incarnation of pure Truth, Oh! mighty Deep! And thou didst murder him in prime of youth, For whom I weep! And, murdering him, didst more than murder me! Who was my Heaven on earth, oh! treacherous Sea! My more than Heaven on earth, oh! more than murderous Sea! VI. My spirit wearied not to succor his, Oh! mighty Deep! The oftener done the greater was the bliss; But now I weep! And where his beauty lay, unceasing pain Now dwellsâmy heart can know no joy again! Poor Doveless Ark! can know no joy on earth again! VII. God of my fathers! God of that bright One Drowned in the Deep! Shall we not meet again beyond the sunâ No more to weep? Yes, I shall meet him thereâthe lostâthe brightâ The glorious Shelley! Spring of my delight! Fountain of all my pleasure! life of my delight! VIII. Now, like Orion on some cloudless night Above the Deep, I see his soul look down from Heavenâhow bright! While I here weep! And there, like Hesperus the stars of even, Beckon my soul away to him in Heavenâ Sitting, star-crowned, upon the highest still in Heaven! THE CHAPLET OF CYPRESS. AN ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF MY SISTER. âThe Good die first.â I. Up through the hyaline ether-sea, Star-diademed, in chariot of pure pain, Through th' empyreal star-fires radiantly, Triumphant over Death in Heaven to reign Thy soul is gone, seeking its Blest Abode, Where break the songs of stars against the feet of God. II. At Heaven's high portals thou dost stand, Bands of attendant Angels by thy sideâ Gazing with rapture on the Promised Landâ Paleâmeekâwith thy last sickness, purified, By suffering, from the sins of earth, to be A white-robed Angel round God's throne eternally. III. Like stars at midnight in the sky, Were all the dark things in this world to thee; The joys of earth, when thou wert called to die, Were ringing in thine ears most audibly, When Angel-voices from the far-off skies, Poured on thy soul rivers of rapturous melodies IV. Upon thy pale, cold, silent face, Still speaking of the death that thou didst dieâ A living light, which Death could not efface, Was shed, crowning thy young mortalityâ As if the power had unto thee been given To show us here on earth what thou art now in Heaven. V. For when thy coffin-lid was moved, Fast flowing tears of endless pity fell Upon thy pale, cold brow, so much beloved, From our torn hearts, as we then cried, Farewell! Like dews upon some withered lily-leafâ Rivers of sorrow from deep seas of bitter grief! VI. At thine, the newest grave dug here, Beside our parents' graves, we humbly bow, Offering our hearts to God in silent prayerâ Asking ourselves who of us next must go Where thou art gone, to see what thou hast seenâ To be what thou art now, if now what thou hast been! VII. I recollect the last long night We played togetherâbrothersâsistersâallâ Took notice of the infinite delight That filled thy soul, till laughter's waterfall Gushed, gurgling from thy lips in joyful flowâ And this, dear One! was only three short months ago! VIII. Then thou wert gayer than the gay, And full of pleasure to the very brimâ Whiling, with gladness, all thy time awayâ Not thinking thou wert soon to go to Himâ Thy Father's father, there, in Heaven, to shine With thy dear motherâbrotherâsister Adaline! IX. Thou wilt behold my Florence there, And she will know thee in that world above, By that, which, wanting, makes us strangers here! And she will love thee with the same deep love She loved me in this world, if thou wilt tell Her thou art my dear sisterâAngel! fare-thee-well! THRENODY. COMPOSED ON THE DEATH OF MY LITTLE BOY. âI will complain in the bitterness of my soul.ââ Job, vii. 11. I. By the Waters of Salvation, Christ's Salvation, full of painâ Christ's Salvation, in probation, I sit down in tribulation, And now write this Lamentation For the lost, the early slain! Waiting, (hoping for salvation,) For his coming back again. II. Ah! Angelic was my Tommy, Tommy, Death has early slain, Tommy taken early from me! Whose sweet life did so become me, That his death doth now consume meâ Parching up my heart with pain! Ah! Angelic was my Tommyâ Never coming back again! III. How I miss him in the summer, Summer of the Golden Grainâ Summer, when the dove doth murmur For the mate that is torn from herâ Sighing out to each new comer All her heart's melodious pain! Waiting all the livelong summer For his coming back again! IV. Early frosted Flower of Aiden, Aiden where there is no painâ Aiden where the soul lives laden With the joys that are unfadenâ Saintly Lily, infant maiden, Ada of my heart of pain! Thou art with him now in Aidenâ Never coming back again! V. Like the glorified Orion, Blest Orion who was slain! Bright Orion who lives high on High Eternity's Mount Zionâ So my little Christ did die on This dark Calvary of pain! Like the glorified Orionâ Never coming back again! VI. In that undefiled bright Thule, Thule of eternal gainâ Thule were the soul sees newly From the Isles of Inatula To the golden bowered Beula, Where his Saviour Christ doth reign; In that undefiled bright Thuleâ Never coming back again! VII. All my days are spent in weeping, Weeping for the early slainâ Weeping, patient vigils keeping By the grave where he is sleeping, Sorrow from Death's field still reaping Reaping for the early slain! All my days are spent in weeping For his coming back again! VIII. On the earth are now no traces, Traces of his former reignâ Traces, where the joyful faces Of his sisters, like the Graces, Made an Eden of the places Where they met in my domain; On the earth are now no traces Of his coming back again! IX. I shall never more see Pleasure, Pleasure never more, but painâ Pleasure, losing that dear treasure Whom I loved here without measure, Whose sweet eyes were Heaven's own azure, Sparkling, mild, like sunny rain! I shall never more see Pleasure For his coming back again! X. How my weary soul doth miss him, Miss him here in bitter painâ Miss him when I want to kiss him, At the night when I should bless him, When his mother should undress him For the bed where he has lain! How my soul doth always miss himâ Never coming back again! XI. How we miss his songs of gladness, Gladness far too deep for painâ Gladness too divine for sadness, Poured with such exultant madness That it seemed just done for badness, As in sunshine falls the rain; All my soul is turned to sadness For his coming back again! XII. How my soul doth long to meet him, Meet him in this world againâ Meet him where I used to greet him, As the Saints in Heaven now treat himâ On my vacant knees to seat him, Where in joy he used to reign; How my soul doth long to meet him In this trying world again! XIII. Where the nightingale sits singing, Singing with impassioned painâ Singing, while the Heavens are ringing With his river-song upspringingâ Into Heaven his soul went winging Of its way with Christ to reign; There my little Bird sits singingâ Never coming back again! XIV. All my tears are unavailing, Unavailing all this painâ Unavailing all this wailing Of my heart that now is failing With its weight of wo, unveiling All my soul's deep grief in vain! All my sighs are unavailingâ He will never come again! XV. Soon my sighing soul, death-blighted, Blighted, racked with bitter painâ Blighted, burthened, all benighted, Shall in Heaven above be righted, Glorified, redeemed, requited, When it meets my early slain; There to wait no more death-blighted, For his coming back again. XVI. Hang thy harp upon the willow, Willow weeping tears of rainâ Willow shading the soft billow Of his grave with light so mellow, Just above the satin pillow Where his head so long has lain! Hang thy harp upon the willowâ He will never come again! XVII. Ah! when shall I ever hold him, Hold him in these arms again? Hold him, tenderly enfold him, And with tears of joy behold him, And retell what I have told himâ Kissing him with joyful pain!â Up in Heaven I shall behold himâ I shall meet him there again. THE VIOLET IN THE VALLEY OF DEATH. AN ELEGY ON THE DEATH OF MY LITTLE CHILD. When Solon wept for the death of his son, some one said, âWeeping will not help.â He answered, âAlas! therefore, I weep, because weeping will not help!â I. Hushed is now thy bitter crying, Folded in the calm serene Of the peace of God undying, Beautiful divine Eugene! For thy soul ascends, returning Back to Heaven where it was born, With Beatus in it burning For the Everlasting Morn. May the Lord in Heaven have mercy On thy soul, my darling child! Precious blue-eyed Eugene Percy! Blessed babe that never smiled! II. Tenderest tears of sorrow ever From my heart's deep fount shall flow, Watering Love's sweet flower forever, Which by tears can only grow. Losing that divinest treasure God in Heaven had given to me, Nothing now can give me pleasure, But the Hopes of meeting thee. May the Lord in Heaven have mercy On thy soul, my darling child! Precious blue-eyed Eugene Percy! Blessed babe that never smiled! III. Like the Moon in her own splendor, Waning on some cloudless night, Lay thy lily-limbs so tender, Shrouded in their own pure light Now thy blessed star-like spirit, Glory-circled, full of love, Doth the joys of Heaven inherit, Cradled in Christ's breast above. Thus the Lord of Heaven has mercy On thy soul, my darling child! Precious blue-eyed Eugene Percy! Blessed babe that never smiled! IV. From the Fountains Everlasting, Flowing out of God's great store, Thy pure spirit now is tasting Bliss divine forever more. In the golden sunny silence Of the bliss of God sereneâ Young Dove of the Blessed Islands Liveth my divine Eugene. Thus the Lord in Heaven has mercy On thy soul, my darling child! Precious blue-eyed Eugene Percy! Blessed babe that never smiled! V. Underneath the saintly roses Blooming round me while I weep, Near where Florence now reposesâ Take thy fill of peaceful sleep. Silent on thy satin pillow Rest thy pensive little head, While above the weeping willow Tells my sorrows for the dead! For the Lord in Heaven has mercy On thy soul, my darling child! Precious blue-eyed Eugene Percy! Blessed babe that never smiled! TO ISA IN HEAVEN. âEarly, bright, transient, chaste as morning dew. She sparkled, was exhaled and went to heaven!ââ Young. I. Where is she now? Oh! Isa! tell me where thou art? If Death has laid his hand upon thy brow, Has he not touched my heart? Has he not laid it in the grave with thine, And buried all my joys?âSpeak! thou art mine! II. If thou wert dead, I would not ask thee to reply; But thou art livingâthy dear soul has fled To Heaven where it can never die! Then why not come to me? Returnâreturn, And comfort me, for I have much to mourn! III. I sigh all day! I mourn for thee the livelong night! And when the next night comes, thou art away, And so is absent my delight! Oh! as the lone dove for his absent mate, So is my soul for thee disconsolate! IV. I long for deathâ For any thingâto be with thee! I did inhale, alas! thy dying breath, That it might have some power on me To make me what thou art!âbut, thou art dead! And I am here!âit strengthened me instead! V. Joy there is noneâ It went into the grave with thee! And Grief, because my spirit is alone, Is all that comes to comfort me! The very air I breathe is turned to sighs, And all my soul seems melting from mine eyes. VI. I hear, at even, The liquid carol of the birds; Their music makes me think of thee in Heaven, It is so much like thy sweet words. The brooklet whispers, as it runs along, Our first love-story with its liquid tongue. VII. Wake, Isa! wake! And come back in this world again! Oh! come down to me, for my soul's dear sake, And cure me of this trying pain! I would give all that earth to man can be, If thou wert only in this world with me! VIII. Day after day I seek thee, but thou art not near! I sit down by thy grave in the cold clay, And listen for thy soul!âoh! dear! And when some withered leaf falls from the tree, I start, as if thy soul had spoke to me! IX. And so it is, And so it evermore must be To him, who has been robbed of all the bliss He ever knew, by losing thee! For Misery, in thine absence, is my wife! What Joy had been, hadst thou remained in life! X. It is now even! The birds have sung themselves to sleep; And all the stars seem coming out of Heaven, As if to look upon me weep!â Oh! let me not look up to thee in vain, But come back to me in this world again! THE CROSS OF MY CROWN. I. If thou wert dead I would not weep, For then my spirit soon would be Free from this sorrow which now makes me keep Such vigils of deep agony Forever more for thee. II. I once did think, in my deep love, That thou wert never born to die; But came down solely from the Heavens above To live with me eternally, As thou didst live on high. III. But since thou hast been false to me, I know that thou wert born to die; For wanting that sweet Heavenly purity The Angels have in Heaven on highâ Doth breed mortality! IV. I sigh for thee the livelong dayâ I mourn for thee the long, long night! For Heaven thus absent from my soul alway, Shuts out forever from my sight My heart's divine delight! V. Thou wert the world wherein I dweltâ Lost now since thou art gone from me! The only Heaven to which my spirit knelt, And worshiped, weeping, wonderinglyâ Finding my God in thee! VI. But nowâsince thou art false to meâ I am of mine own soul afraid! For if the Angel that once dwelt in thee, Was Hell in Heaven's own light arrayedâ What may not Heaven be made? VII. If thou wert all this world to me, What have I now since thou art gone? But worldless Hellâbut Heavenless miseryâ And bitter torments only known To him who lovesâbut lives alone! SONG FROM THE INNER LIFE. I. Sing to the Lord, oh! weary soul of sorrow! Sing to the Lord, though chastened by his rod! Sing to the Lord that others hope may borrowâ âThe pure in heart see God.â II. Sink not beneath the yoke of tribulation, Poor weary mortal on life's thorny road! But bear up stately with this consolationâ âThe pure in heart see God.â III. Take up thy Crossâwhen thou art weary laden, Think how Christ sank beneath the heavy load! High over Calvary shines the Heavenly Aidenâ âThe pure in heart see God.â IV. Cherish the Golden Words that he has spoken, Then march up Calvary with thy heavy load, Where his pure body on the Cross was brokenâ âThe pure in heart see God.â V. His yoke is easyâlight, too, is his burdenâ Death is the Gate to his Divine Abodeâ The Land of Promise lies beyond the Jordanâ âThe pure in heart see God.â VI. Angels of Light their vigils now are keeping, Crowding the ladder up to Heaven's Abodeâ While Jacob soft on Bethel-Plain lies sleepingâ âThe pure in heart see God.â VII. A flood of glory down from Heaven comes streaming, Washing the Angels white along the roadâ While, weary with his wrestling, he lies dreamingâ âThe pure in heart see God.â VIII. God's golden glory up the East is springing, Flooding with splendor all that Blest Abode, While Angels cluster at the High Gates singingâ âThe pure in heart see God.â IX. Rising, re-strengthened, like the Blest Immortals Climbing the ladder, from the dewy sod, He hears again at Heaven's crystalline portalsâ âThe pure in heart see God.â X. Thus, while the good are on the dark earth sleeping, Weary with travelling on life's thorny roadâ Angels around their heads strict watch are keepingâ âThe pure in heart see God.â XI. So, while the thorns are round the good man springing, Bleeding his feet till they baptize the sodâ Angels of Light are to his high soul singingâ âThe pure in heart see God.â XII. Wide as Ezekiel's ever-flowing river, No eye could see across it was so broadâ Shall this sweet song flow down the world foreverâ âThe pure in heart see God.â THE FALLEN TEMPLE. âThe man of God lives longer without a tomb than any by one, invisibly interred by angels.ââ Sir Thomas Brown. I. The body of this man is dead! Once there was wisdom in his head; Soon he will in the grave be laidâ His soul in immortality arrayed. II. For in his bodyâGod-loved One! It dwelt as light does in the sun; But now his Week of Life is doneâ The Sabbath of sweet rest begun. III. In Death's great whirlwind he did hear God's voice upon his listening ear Breaking in accents silver-clearâ âThe Goal that thou dost seek is near.â IV. His soul with wisdom was replete; He walked with Hell beneath his feet; The music that he made was sweet; Beside God's throne he takes his seat. V. God's splendor round his head did glow, Because his heart did overflow With pity for another's woeâ Such goodness God alone could know. VI. His heart replied unto his headâ With wisdom it was always fed; One to the other ministeredâ For what one felt the other said. VII. His Angel-soul was made to be A Green Isle in God's Silver Sea, Whose thoughts were Flowers of Poetry, Blooming therein eternally. VIII. Such prospect did his soul command, From this dark world, where he did stand, He saw in Heaven the Promised Landâ Beyond the starry shining band. IX. Then did his giant soul give birth To this great thought in going forthâ The greatest, God-like thing on earth Is homage done to human worth. X. Prophetic music did he make For his own soul's eternal sake, When Death did all his heart-strings breakâ Then from life's death did he awake. XI. With intellectual travail throes Did he give birth to those great woes Which no one but the Poet knowsâ And, knowing, knoweth no repose. THE LILY OF HEAVEN. I. Now in her snow-white shroud she liesâ (Her lily lids half veil her eyes)â As if she looked with wild surprise Up at her soul in Paradise. II. Her hands lie folded on her breastâ Crossed like the Cross that gave her rest; She looks as if some heavenly guest Had told her that her soul was blest. III. She lies as if she seemed to hear Sphere-music breaking on her earâ Breaking in accents silver-clearâ In concert with her soul up there. IV. Her body was the Temple bright In which her soul dwelt full of light, Triumphing over Death's dark nightâ High Heaven laid open to the sight. V. Burning with pure seraphic love, Veiled in the meekness of the doveâ Her soul, now all things past to prove, Looks down on me from Heaven above. VI. For her Religion grew more bright, The darker grew the world's dark nightâ Filling her soul with such pure light, High heaven seemed opened to her sight. VII. The calmness of divinest case Rests on her browâupon her faceâ Expressive of her soul's release From this dark world to one of peace. VIII. Her pale, cold, silent lips, comprest, Speak out to me, most manifest, A silent language, of the rest That she now feels among the blest. IX. I wept warm tears upon her face, As she lay there in Death's embrace; Whereon no passion could we traceâ But calmnessâmeeknessâheavenly grace. X. With saintly, pale-face thus she went Out of this world's great discontent, Up through the starry firmament, Into the Place of Pure Content. CATHOLIC HYMN TO THE VIRGIN. I. Santa Maria! hear! oh! hear! And turn to me thy gracious ear; For thou art to the sorrowing near, And, to the Catholic ever dear! II. Like some clear fountain, deep as strong, My soul doth pour out, all night long, Deep gushes of ecstatic song, Begging thee to forgive my wrong! III. Thy Son, dear Mary! though on high, Is to the needy ever nighâ Ready to help them when they sighâ He will not suffer me to die! IV. Speak not, dear Mary! for he hears My bitter criesâbeholds my tears! Soon he will banish all my fears, And give me strength for future years. V. Reach down thy lily hand so white, And lift me up from this dark night, To where thy Son, in glory bright, Sits now arrayed in robes of light. VI. For how my soul doth long to go Out of this world of suffering soâ Suffering as he did here belowâ Thy Son alone in Heaven dost know! VII. For those that were most dear to me Are gone now to eternityâ Living in Angel-purity, Star-crowned, around God's throne with thee! VIII. A respite from this trying pain My soul now seeks in song againâ Wasting away my heart to gain Thy blissful loveâbut not in vain. IX. I think I hear thy soft replies Dawning upon me from the skiesâ Wiping the heart-dew from mine eyes, Till all my grief within me dies. X. My soul, now purified by thought, Into thy blissful arms is caught, Whose presence, like thy Son's, when sought, Comes when we most expect it not. XI. Such rapture now my heart doth swell As nothing earthly can excelâ Lifting me up from this dark Hell To Heaven above with thee to dwell. XII. The bloody sweat oozed from the brow Of thy dear Son on earth below! And how my soul doth love him now, That Son alone in Heaven dost know. SONG OF LE VERRIER ON DISCOVERING A NEW PLANET. I. Circling the Cyclic-chorus of the spheres, Sphering the Epicycle of his songâ He sings his anthems, through th' eternal years, Outside the orb-paths of th' Empyreal throng. II. Floating in chariot of celestial fire, Sphered Heavenward through th' Empyreal Ether-Sea, He rays his sphere-tones out unto the choir Of God until they fill Eternity. III. Tempestuous whirlwinds of deep melody Dash from his orb-prow on his spheric roadâ Rolling in mountain-billows on Heaven's sea Against the white shore of the feet of God. IV. Shouting Excelsior to the starry choir Flooded with rapture, now he Heavenward rolls, Glinting those golden tones of lightning-fire Proceeding swiftly from the Angels' souls. SONNET. THE RELEASE OF FIONNUALA. âFionnuala, the daughter of Lir, was, by some supernatural power, transformed into a swan, and condemned to wander, for many hundred years, over certain lakes and rivers in Ireland, till the coming of Christianity, when the sound of the first mass-bell was to be the signal of her release.â Beside an island in an inland sea, A virgin Swan came, in the time of spring, Her Heaven-revealing, dying song to sing! Veiled in the night's divine tranquillity, Far in the reeds, where she had come to float, There rose up from her silver-sounding throat A whirlwind of cherubic melody, Which hurricaned the silence of the night, And rapt with an immortal ecstacyâ (Making them think it day in their delight)â The birds within the solitudesâwhen right To Heaven, transfigured, glorified, she went, Leaving the world in mute astonishmentâ Drowned in the deluge of her agony. SHILOH. âHe came as far as to the ANCIENT of days.ââ Literal Version. I. The Gospel he came down to preach, No other one had power to teach; The highest Angel failed to reach The music that was in his speech. II. Out of his soul's great sea did flow Rivers of truth for man to know; Which, unto those who saw them so, Made Heaven come down on earth below III. Those world-old Truths that lay concealed In God's great heartâ(to him revealed) Like some great fountain, just unsealed, Out of his soul in thunder pealed. IV. Great Messenger of Heavenly Truth (Perpetual pulchritude his youth) Sent down from Heaven with God-like ruth To sing the barren rough world smoothe. V. His God-like voice made dumb the choir Of Heaven with his great Seraph-lyre, When from his soul divine desire Gushed forth in notes of living fire. VI. His sun-like soul with glory bright, Dissolved away the world's dark night; Then rising up with Gabriel might, Went back to Heaven on wings of light. ORPHIC EVANGEL. I. When shall the Golden Words that once were spoken By our great august Lord be heard by men? His beautiful body on the cross once broken, Be made the model of our lives again? This is the burden of my songâ âHow long, Oh! Lord! how long?â II. How long before the Gabriel Years, all golden, Shall walk the world where Sin has walked so longâ Crushing with God-like tread the Ages Olden Out of our hearts, that we may grow as strong! This is the burden of my songâ âHow long, Oh! Lord! how long?â III. How long before Man's form of Angel-beauty, Dead in earth's tomb, where it has lain so long, Shall rise again, redeemed, to do its duty, And, like Christ's Angel, die no more by wrong? This is the burden of my songâ âHow long, Oh! Lord! how long?â IV. Like the great Prophet when he stood benighted, Waiting to see God's Sun in glory shine; My faith-uplifted soul beholds, delighted, The far-off shining of the Light Divine! This shall engage my songâ âHow long, Oh! Lord! how long?â TO ONE IN PARADISE I. Oh! return, love! return from that dark lonely Dwelling, The sad silent grave where thy beauty is laid! To the heart that is mourningâthe bosom now swelling To pillow thy form lying low with the dead! Thy beautiful form lying low with the dead! II. Oh! return, that mine eyes, which are red now with weeping, May behold thy dear presence once Heaven to me! And restore the dead Joys that are silently sleeping Beneath the damp sod in that cold grave with thee! The cold clammy sod in that dark grave with thee! III. Though they say that from death there can be no returning, Oh! break the stern bars that confine thee beneath! And recall the bright soul that in Heaven is burning To light back thy form from the Valley of Death! Thy beautiful form from the Valley of Death! IV. Oh! return like the Star that in Heaven is shiningâ Return to illumine this life's dim abode! And restore the dark soul that is silently pining To meet thee again in the bosom of God! With thy beautiful Christ in the bosom of God!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LILIES OF LOVE. LA CONTADINA. âIl vago spirito ardente E'n alto intelletto, un puro core.ââ Petrarcha. âShe seemed a splendid Angel newly drest, Save wings, for Heaven.ââ Keats. Her tender Breasts were like two snow-white Doves Upon one willow bough at calm of even, Telling each other, side by side, their loves In soft celestial tones as sweet as Heaven. And as the soft winds, from the flowery grove, Sway them thus sitting on that willow-bough, At every breathâat every sigh of loveâ They undulate upon her bosom now. Two dove-like spirits on her eyelids knelt, And weighed them gently, covering half her eyes, Whose soul in their own azure seemed to melt And mingle, as the sunlight with the skies. Her eyes were like two violets bathed in dew In which each lash was mirrored dark within, As in some Lake, reflecting Heaven so blue, The willow-bough's long languid limbs are seen. As God's celestial look is far too bright For Angel's gaze in Heaven if not kept dim, And partly shorn of its excessive light By the broad pinions of the cherubim; So, these two spirits, one on each fair lid, Let down the lash-fringed curtain to conceal And keep but half that heavenly glory hid, Which it were death to mortals to reveal. GOOD NIGHT. I. Now the Nightingale sits singing, By his Rose-bud in the grove, While the Heavens above are ringing With his river-song of love. Like the wild Swan on the ocean, Circled with her Cygnets white, Star-engirdled, with soft motion, Sails the Moon through Heaven to-night. Good night, my Love! my dearest! High heaven of my delight! Of all things brightest, fairest! My Beautifulâgood night! II. Goâwhile thou art softly sleeping By the clear Elysian streams, I will be awake here weeping By the âIvory gate of Dreams.â Angels, like the stars in number, Watchers from their Courts of Light, Sing around thy peaceful slumber Through the beautiful good night. Good night, my Love! my dearest! High Heaven of my delight! Of all things brightest, fairest! My Beautifulâgood night! III. While the odorous flowers are closing Their soft petals in the dew, Thou wilt be in bed reposingâ I awake in mine for you. Take, oh, take to your soft bosom! Faithful nurse of my Delight! This sweet Lily-bell in blossom, And preserve her there, Good Night! Good night, my Love! my dearest! High heaven of my delight! Of all things brightest, fairest! My Beautifulâgood night! IV. Here we both stand broken hearted, Leaning on each other's heart; For in parting we seem parted, Just to think that we must part. See! the pale, cold moon is waningâ Sinking softly from our sightâ While our souls are here complaining For the loss of our good night! Good night, my Love! my dearest! High Heaven of my delight! Of all things brightest, fairest! My Beautifulâgood night! V. Where the Nightingale sits singing By his Rose-bud in the grove, While the Heavens above are ringing With his river-song of love; While my soul is left here sighing Out its song for my Delight, I now hear her voice replying Unto mine, âMy Love! good night!â Good night, my Love! my dearest! High Heaven of my delight! Of all things brightest, fairest! My Beautifulâgood night! LOVE. I. What is it that makes the maiden So like Christ in Heaven above? Or, like Heavenly Eve in Aiden, Meeting Adam, blushing:âloveâ Love, love, love! ECHO.Love! II. What is it that makes the murmur Of the plaintive turtle dove Fill our hearts with so much Summer 'Till they melt to passion?âloveâ Love, love, love! ECHO.Love! III. See the Rose unfold her bosom To the amorous Sun aboveâ Bursting into fragrant blossom At his sight!âwhat is it?âloveâ Love, love, love! ECHO.Love! IV. Like the peace-song of the Angels Sent to one from Heaven above Who believes in Christ's Evangelsâ Is the voice of one in loveâ Love, love, love! ECHO.Love! V. Christ, who once on earth was sorry, Captain of the host above, Left his Father's throne of glory To redeem us by his loveâ Love, love, love! ECHO.Love! VI. Why was he made Mediatorâ Stooping from the Heavens above? Was he not our Great Creator? Angels answerââGod is Loveââ Love, love, love! ECHO.Love! VII. All the Christian Constellations Choiring through the realms above, Soon would cease their ministrations Were it not for thee, oh! Love! Love, love, love! ECHO.Love! THE VOICE OF THOUGHT. Faint as the far-down tone Beneath the sounding sea, Muffled, by its own moan, To silent melody; So faint we cannot tell But that the sound we hear Is some sweet roses' smell That falls upon our ear; (As if the Butterfly, Shaking the Lily-bell, While drinking joyfully, Should toll its own death-knell!) Sweeter than Hope's sweet lute Singing of joys to be, When Pain's harsh voice is mute, Is the Soul's sweet song to me. SONG TO ISA. I. Upon thy lips now lies The music-dew of love; And in thy deep blue eyes, More mild than heaven above, The meekness of the dove. II. More sweet than the perfume Of snow-white jessamine, When it is first in bloom, Is that sweet breath of thine, Which mingles now with mine. III. Like an Ãolian sound, Out of an ocean shell, Which fills the air around With music, such as fell From lips of Israfel; IV. Over thy lips now flow, Out of thy heart for me, Sweet songs, which none can know But him who hopes to be Forevermore with thee. V. And like the snow-white Dove Frightened from earth at even On tempests borne above,â My swift-winged soul is driven Upon thy voice to heaven! EULALIE. I. Her rich cascade of hair, Around her swan-like throat, Down on her bosom bare, In wavy gold doth float. II. Her lily-lidded eyes, Burning in their own light, Seem melted from the skies, They are so Heavenly bright. III. Her hands are rosy-white, Like lilies in the sun; Her countenance makes bright All that she smiles upon. IV. Her words are soft as dew Dropt on some flower at even, As if, (though known to few,) She spoke the tongue of Heaven. V. As when the summer South A rose-bud doth dispart, The lips of her sweet mouth Seem opened by her heart. VI. As perfume from the rose, Just opening, from her tongue The soul of fragrance flows Out of her heart in song. VII. Her breath is like the sweet Perfume of flowers at even, When all the rarest meet, And every one is Heaven. VIII. As joyful hearts of birds High overflow in song, Her innocent heart in words Flows golden from her tongue. IX. All things to her seem pure, Because her heart is so; Ah! how can she endure The real truth to know? X. Sweeter than harp or lute Is her sweet song to me; Softer than Dorian flute Her Lydian melody. XI. As PÃ¦ans of wild bliss The birds pour forth in Spring, So, Heaven the Thesis is Of all that she doth sing XII. Ah! how my soul doth love To hear her sing at evenâ Singing, on earth, above Sweet Israfel in Heaven. XIII. Mild as some breeze at noonâ Soft as the pale cold light Rained from the full-orbed moon Upon the down of night. XIV. For when her song doth move Her trembling lips apart, The joys of Heaven above Seem poured into my heart. XV. Sweet as the fragrance smells Of lily-bells at even, Is that sweet song which tells, On earth, the joys of Heaven XVI. Sweeter than voice of swan Upon some Summer sea, Piling to Heaven, at dawn, His clarion melody. XVII. For when she sings at night, The stars appear to me To burn more Heavenly bright In her sweet symphony. XVIII. Soft words from off the eaves Of her sweet lips now fall, Like dew drops from the leaves Of rosesârhythmical. XIX. For as the rose-lipped shell The riches of the sea; So does her song now tell Her heart's deep love for me. XX. Star of my life's dark night! Thou wert to me first givenâ Bright Vesper of delight! To lead my soul to Heaven. LILY ADAIR. I. The Apollo Belvidere was adorning The Chamber where Eulalie lay, While Aurora, the Rose of the Morning, Smiled full in the face of the Day. All around stood the beautiful Graces Bathing Venusâsome combing her hairâ While she lay in her husband's embraces It was a beautiful Idea of the Greeks that the procreation of beautiful children might be promoted by keeping in their sleeping apartments an Apollo or Hyacinthus. In this way they not only patronized Art, but begat a likeness of their own love. A-moulding my Lily Adairâ Of my Fawn-like Lily Adairâ Of my Dove-like Lily Adairâ Of my beautiful, dutiful Lily Adair. II. Where the Oreads played in the Highlands, And the Water-Nymphs bathed in the streams, In the tall Jasper Reeds of the Islandsâ She wandered in life's early dreams. For the Wood-Nymphs then brought from the Wildwood The turtle Doves Venus kept there, Which the Dryades tamed, in his childhood, For Cupid, to Lily Adairâ To my Dove-like Lily Adairâ To my lamb-like Lily Adairâ To my beautiful, dutiful Lily Adair. III. Where the Opaline Swan circled, singing, With her eider-down Cygnets at noon, In the tall Jasper Reeds that were springing From the marge of the crystal Lagoonâ Rich Canticles, clarion-like, golden, Such as only true love can declare, Like an Archangel's voice in times oldenâ I went with my Lily Adairâ With my lamb-like Lily Adairâ With my saint-like Lily Adairâ With my beautiful, dutiful Lily Adair. IV. Her eyes, lily-lidded, were azure, Cerulian, celestial, divineâ Suffused with the soul-light of pleasure, Which drew all the soul out of mine. She had all the rich grace of the Graces, And all that they had not to spare; For it took all their beautiful faces To make one for Lily Adairâ For my Christ-like Lily Adairâ For my Heaven-born Lily Adairâ For my beautiful, dutiful Lily Adair. V. She was fairer by far than that Maiden, The star-bright Cassiope, Who was taken by Angels to Aiden, And crowned with eternity. For her beauty the Sea-Nymphs offended, Because so surpassingly fair; And so death then the precious life ended Of my beautiful Lily Adairâ Of my Heaven-born Lily Adairâ Of my star-crowned Lily Adairâ Of my beautiful, dutiful Lily Adair. VI. From her Paradise-Isles in the ocean, To the beautiful City of On, By the melliffluent rivers of Goshen, My beautiful Lily is gone! In her Chariot of Fire translated, Like Elijah, she passed through the air, To the City of God golden-gatedâ The Home of my Lily Adairâ Of my star-crowned Lily Adairâ Of my God-loved Lily Adairâ Of my beautiful, dutiful Lily Adair. VII. On the vista-path made by the Angels, In her Chariot of Fire, she rode, While the Cherubim sang their Evangelsâ To the Gates of the City of God. For the Cherubim-band that went with her, I saw them pass out of the airâ I saw them go up through the ether Into Heaven with my Lily Adairâ With my Christ-like Lily Adairâ With my God-loved Lily Adairâ With my beautiful, dutiful Lily Adair. SONNET. ON READING MILTON'S PARADISE LOST Sweet as that soul-uplifting Hydromel Idcan Ganymede did give to Jove In the God-kingdoms of Immortal Loveâ Dipt from Heaven's everlasting Golden Wellâ Was thy great song, celestial Israfel! Like that Apollo near the shining portals Of Heaven, in chariot, with celestial lyre, Sung for the thronging glorified Immortals, Which set the souls of all the gods on fire! So sweet my soul, entranced, seemed suddenly brought Before the star-crowned, blazing majesty Of those great Sages of immortal thought, And Poet-kings of deathless melody, Who now shake Heaven with thunderous Jubilee. THE QUEEN OF LOVE. LA REINETTE DE MON CÅUR. A bright enameled Brooch of purest gold She sported in her sunny-silken hair; New lilac satin did her limbs enfold, While round her Moon-like brow more fair Than Heaven when all the sky is clear, A Diamond-studded chain of gold she wore, Starred in the centre with her feronnier Which shone like Vesper on the heavenly shore. A glove of spotless kid enclosed her hand; A golden Bracelet circled each fair wrist; The ground on which her tender feet did stand Was by her Kid-ensandaled feet imprest, Like letters written by an Angel's hand In Hieroglyphics of the Heavenly Land: And all who saw her said she was possest Of beauty that would make an Angel blest. An Antique Cameo starred her silver vest, Fit emblem of her heart it did unfoldâ Couched in the valley of her snow-white breast, Encased in circles of the purest gold. The rich Design which graced the Gem was this; A snow-white Dove, perched on a Tulip-Vase, Was sipping nectar from the Chalice full, While by her side there stood, with artless grace, Her mate, drinking, in Art most beautifulâ This Antique Symbol set there to express, In loftiest Art, her artful artlessness.</field>
