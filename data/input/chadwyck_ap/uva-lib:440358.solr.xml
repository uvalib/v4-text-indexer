      <field name="fulltext">THE GROUP. READER, If thine eyes have ever been blessed with an exhibition of the group of venerable heads celebrated in the following sheets, and thou dost therefore obstinately pronounce them flesh and blood, I know not by what mode of argument I can hope to overturn thy creed: neither do I esteem the enquiry interesting if thou and I are satisfied that such things are. Art thou disposed to exercise thy physiognomonical talents? Behold a delectable field! and equally so, whether thou dost recognise, in the objects of thy speculation, the imitative canvass or the automaton. I shall consequently leave thy imagination unfettered, that thou mayest enjoy, in thy own way, the coming entertainment, and be at liberty to follow the flights of poetic inspiration wherever they may lead. The prefixed Engraving was designed, merely as an index, to direct thy eyes to their object, a Pointer, whose staunch nose might enable thee to spring the whole Covey; but, unluckily, the labour bestowed on its execution, serves also to evince that the Arts in this country are already blushing in the bud. KEY-PLATE TO THE GROUP. President, a rope-maker, T?y. Solon Verges, a carpenter, L?d. Tom Belch, a drover, J?ns. Gaffer Macgoggle, a shipwright, P?n. Richard Sniffle, a carpenter, M?y. Nat Futtock, a shipwright, H?n. Gobbo Finis, a coffin-maker, D?ss. Gudgion, a strange fish, little known, S?d. John Stripe, a schoolmaster, L?e. Nat Gluepot, a joiner, F?n. Toby Twist, a rope maker, P?e. “It were no better than picture-like to hang against a wall “if renown made it not stir.”— COR. SHAKESPEARE. Pictures, as paint and canvass, I despise, I like the virtues they immortalize, And while such worth, with critic eye, I scan, I love the likeness, and adore the man. Thus, by the States' decree, in living lines Triumphantly, the Group of S?th?k shines; Demands the meed of verse, and blots the praise Of ancient pencils and of modern days; Makes Brouwer dull, surmounts the grotesque school, And out-apes Nature in a nat'ral fool. None saw, but in the Poets page alone, The breathing canvass, or the speaking stone; But here the prodigy all must allow, And what was fiction then, is real now. An artist, once, in days of old, 'tis said, With peerless sleight, had finish'd off a head, And, to complete the wonder with a word, Speak! said the Artist—not a muscle stir'd: Not so our painters, e'er the piece was done, The kennel open'd, and the cry begun. Oh! happy Artists, of the palm secure! You manage with such art the clair-obscure, With talents so profound, such potent skill, You've made e'en “dusky darkness visible:” To little purpose, I the wreath present; Your works, great masters, are your monument. The souls' broad feature there I teach to trace, (Tho' all behold, yet few can read a face,) And, while each figure labours to excel, The little story of his life I tell. Those, of my readers who are desirous of viewing this extraordinary Group of drolls, may learn in the following lines, the time and place, when and where it may be seen gratis. Near Ebenezer, spot belov'd by fame, Shines it each Monday night in wooden frame, And, round the place, with equal stile display'd, A thousand pretty scenes in light and shade. Here black Europas gain their cream skin'd Bulls; There tipsy Bacchus's with broken sculls; Observe you will oft pictur'd as you pass, Young Danæs ravish'd by a drop of brass; Joves, clad in bear-skin, suck Calista's paw, And sleeping Venuses on beds of straw. These the bright models are from which arose The choicest graces that our picture owes. A chief and fourteen more compose the piece; A master gander and his flock of geese! Where president and all with one accord, Are circumseated at an empty board, With this distinction, he obtains a chair, Thrice lucky man! the rest on stools appear. Sweet Sylph, who seek'st the fleecy clouds repose, Or giv'st its colours to the morning rose, The painted beam delighting to untie; And form'st phantastic figures in the sky, Come be my Muse, tell whence each feature springs, And flutter round thy poet while he sings. Shall I, dear comrade, to my subject true, The gentle bathos in the tale pursue? Or, rising gradual up the soft ascent Of a bright climax, gain the President? “Order is Heaven's first law! the poets lays “Must class the grades of virtue they would praise, “To the exalted give peculiar grace, “As first in merit, so the first in place.” True, but, on second tho't, I shrewdly deem 'Their parts all librate on too nice a beam; As these, in this, so those in that excel, A fly-blow here, or there would turn the scale. “Then what so plain? pursue the artist's track; “First sketch the fore-ground, middle, then the back.” Alas! that I such counsel must refuse! 'Tis all back-ground, all shadow gentle muse. Well one by one their merits thou advance, E'en as they came into the world—by chance. Of happy quaintness, and a wingless wit, On yon joint stool see pondering Verges sit. No common 'habitant it be of Earth, Cats bark'd, and horses whistled at his birth; From trances deep, to caper, snails awoke, Oysters grew eloquent, and cockles spoke. As omens promised, so the babe appear'd, Grac'd in his cradle with a length of beard, Sure type of wisdom, and a nose so rare, To it no breach-born nozzle might compare; Such weight of muscles, prominence of beef, What art could give a nose like his relief? While yet a child impulsive genius strains To gain the birth, and throbs his teeming brains; And fledg'd with mandates, featur'd with resolves, The legislative faculty evolves. For plastic nature, in a sportive fit, The germ of greatness in the matrix spit; There quick'ning humours scarcely her obey, And codes of future Law, in embryo, lay. But soon the birth impatient from the core Irruptive burst, and issued at the pore, Like carbuncles, around the brain did thrive, And all the busy surface seem'd alive. Tho' some object against such gifts as these, “They clothe the soul in vile excrescences;” To which I thus reply, as shrewd as just, What is an apple pye without a crust: And sages tell us, 'till by art reveal'd, In the rude block the statue lies conceal'd; So here if art, or chance, or reason can Chip off the legislator, there's the man. Now had he gain'd an age mature and ripe, And learn'd to blow his nose, and smoke a pipe; From post to pillar kick'd, he scratch'd his pate, And rose himself a pillar of the state: Chose', thro' an instinct, by the sov'reign crowd The ass his owners knew, and bray'd aloud. Thus came, at length, the bright, the happy hour, When fame should lead him to her civic bower; When he the garland round his head should wear, Of fragments treasur'd up in safety there; For in the workshop of his brain were strewn, Speeches half fram'd, well season'd by the Moon. Promiscuous heaps of chips, and unwrought stuff, Motions jack'd out, and ideas in the rough. Who e'er rejects, whatever ills oppose, Still cull a statesman by his ample nose; For some, I know, maliciously, maintain That noses are the strainers of the brain, And if, unluckily, they prove too big, Out leak the brains, and lurch the scull and wig: Nay, waxing personal, say Solon's foes Nature has pluck'd his tongue to plume his nose, Thus teaching Verges that she sent him here An object of the eye, and not the ear; And, when t' allure the fool ambition sung, He should have smelt a rat, and held his tongue. But 'lass the day! am I oblig'd to tell That wisdom in a snout delights to dwell; That, not to one poor sense alone confin'd, It teems with all the powers of the mind. Show me a man with extra talents blest, I'll show a nose as far before the rest. See! that which nature gave to G?l?n, Frowns, like a rock, upon his mouth and chin, Threat'ning, aloud each moment as he goes, To fall like thunder on his patriot toes. What gain'd Jew groom the democratic throne? What, but his supplicating nose alone? If megrims plague the head, or spleen deform, A pinch of snuff becalms the gather'd storm; And oft, when impudence infests the brain, Tweak but the nose, and all is right again. When, by the nose, we say a man is led, A chain of reasoning sways the subject head, And all the world consents, an empty snout, Nor sense, nor truth, nor logic turns about. 'Tis true that heads, which stupid were before, By use of wine, will straight with wit run o'er, And, as the volume of the fancy grows, E'en so, expands, its title page, the nose. Thus, have I made my proposition good, And done much more than even Verges could; For oft' he sung, in melancholy plight, And notes symphonious to the dogs of night, Oh! could I prove my brain was not a tripe, And, that my nose was not a cl?s?r?p?pe, Happy were I, and happy were my pen; But who can make a capon of a hen. Oh! Solon, could the muse, in lethe deep, For ever let thy tongue forgotten sleep, I'd not expose it to the public roar, As it has often done by thee before: But rest assur'd, as far as justice may, I'll hide its follies, and its fame display. True, in the House he barely chews his cud, And chips his claws, as many others would; Yet can he wonderfully wag his jaw, And blow a soap-sud bubble thro' a straw; And can, by putting of his tongue thereto, Devise what kind of filth perfumes your shoe. Tho' in the legislature he despair, Look on yon group, he makes a figure there: As busy aspens quiver in the gale, As sing the rattles in the serpent's tail, As catfish at a meal, as fools at fairs, So his abstract of tongue is busy there: And ever, like the wriggling tadpole found, It kicks, and flounces in a flood of sound. When, to this worthy man, the tidings came, That he was summon'd, in the peoples name, To give them laws, he humbly thank'd the crowd, “Grinn'd horribly a ghastly smile,” and bow'd. Then, turning to his shop, with length'ned chin, He pull'd his trowsers up and turn'd ag'in, Again he turns, again his breech he pulls, And thus apostrophis'd his shop and tools, “Thou offspring of my toil, dear little shed! “Farewell, I will not leave thee long,” he said; “Thy boards can witness, and thy joints disclose, “That not by cunning, or by art I rose. “And you, ye tools of well tried steel, adieu, “Ye little chisels, and ye gimlets too, “Who, like your master, ne'er would feel the bit, “But hit the very spot you should not hit: “Wheree'er I go, I'll think upon your weal: “For every sympathetic block I'll feel, “The smallest sprig in safety still shall dwell, “Sweet Tools adieu, dear little Shed farewell,” He said, and scratch'd his head with sapient air, A proof he had a little something there. Now rose his ancient hat, patch'd was his shoe, His strides were length'ned, and his visage grew: And of his coat, his freedom coat no doubt, The back was widen'd, and the sleeves let out, The bag of meal, which promis'd future bread, Now pinch'd his stomach to supply his head, The wenches leer'd the neighbours cry'd good la! And frighted infants scream'd, that's not pappa! I hate the midnight lamp, to read is pain; Tho' books may gild with thought the ideot brain, Old musty parchment may perfume the scull, And see-saw poets make the stupid dull; Yet let this truth, in sweetest numbers, flow, What Nature teaches is enough to know, What instinct, at our birth, she bounteous gave, Is all we want, and all we ought to have: He's dear to Fame who simply boasts of this, Such Midas was, and hungry Verges is. Virtues like these my kindl'ing soul inspire, And I consume with bright poetic fire; Fresh wreaths of moss around his wig shall twine, Who proudly knows not three times three are nine, But, when the sun has set, can tell 'tis night, And knows to scratch his vermin when they bite, If hunger gripe him, he can wisely say, A bone would cure it, or a crust allay; If troubled he can growl, if tickle'd, grin, And feels uneasy if he breaks his shin: This, this is wisdom Nature deigns to own, And this oh! Verges is thy praise alone. Such is the face which hangs on rumours wing, And such the matchless merit which I sing. Accept one boon, dear Solon, e'er we part, The kind, warm wishes of a friendly heart. Long may'st thou live the peoples' rising hope, Still climb the ladder, and avoid the rope; And may, like mine, some much admiring pen Give thee a gentle sonnet now, and then; Still o'er thy noddle may the poppy bow, And sweet meconium circumfuse thy brow; None brighter in yon breathing picture shine, None longer flourish in the poets line, And death in vain his mortal fillip give; There may'st thou figure, here forever live; That men may construe, as they pass along, How looks an Ass's head above the throng. Here I beg the reader will pardon me, if I lead him from the flower-cover'd mountain of poetry, where rhyme responds to rhyme, and the warbling lines pair together like young doves, down to the low meadow ground of humble prose; and be patient while I recite the heads of a conversation, which took place, between a friend and myself, some minutes subsequent to the close of the last verse. After having perused the above lines, he questioned as follows. DIALOGUE. F. Pray sir what may be your object in the high stile of compliment you are displaying, in my opinion to very little purpose? P. I hope to the most salutary purpose: it will have a powerful tendency to point out the propriety of countenancing a system of mental, and pecuniary equality; to develope to the world instances of greatness independent of education; and to turn the time, wasted in youth over books and scholastic cobwebs, into another, and more natural channel: in short sir, I wish to bring all mankind down to the valley flowing with the milk of common property, and the honey of oblivion. F. Your pen and tongue very illy accord in this particular; despising books as you affect to do, it were easy to imagine you would rather assist to diminish, than multiply the number. F. Even such is the drift of my design: is it bad policy to turn the edge of your enemy's weapon against himself? or will the operation of salutary medicine be the less energetic if given under the label of a poison? I think not; and therefore hope my simple, however nauseous, may expel what are really such from the system. F. Many books have been written with nearly the same intention, which have proved an antiperistasis, and strengthened what they sought to destroy. But could you find no characters, to exemplify your principle, who move more in the sphere of public observance than those represented in the object of your adulation? P. None, who stand more on the ground of rendezvous; this fir is the last level which can never fluctuate: you have had a prospect of the scene I presume? F. A kind of lobby view, through a crack in the exibition room, where after betraying some trifling symptoms of trepidation, such as involuntary erection of hair; a strong vibratory motion of the nerves; and a suffusion of cold sweat over the externals; I proceeded to make a few conjectures on the wonderful phænomenon. At first, I thought what I saw might be produced on the wall by means of a magic lantern; but on closer inspection, I found they had three dimensions, and smiled at their proximity in appearance to a circle of grandsire apes diverting themselves by grinning at each other, while they pushed into the fire fragments of fuel left unconsumed by their predecessors: but at length waving the question, whether they were factitious delusions, or actual productions of nature, I exclaimed, in the words of the poet, “Men, bearded, bald, cowl'd, uncowl'd, shod, unshod, Peel'd, patch'd, and pye-bald, linsey-woolsey brothers, Grave mummers! sleeveless some, and shirtless others.” P. Well, is not the union of such variety a very pretty thing, seeing the propensity of Nature to scatter men abroad; particularly where the passions are predominant, they repel each other like the corresponding poles of so many magnets; or fly in a thousand directions, like the rays of a candle; and nothing could have brought so many heterogeneous particles together, had not our artists, like a lens, thrown them into one focus. F. Pshaw! you see precisely the same thing in every mob; with this difference, the mob possesses more energy, and is not quite so ill favoured. But then, I must make some exceptions; for, after the agitation of my spirits had somewhat subsided, and I was at liberty to contemplate, more fully, the physiognomy of the figures before me, I soon discovered three or four faces which varied essentially from the rest, and appeared to bear none of those characteristics you so highly prize. P. I well know which you mean, H?p?ys, M?k?n, P?n?e and I?n?n, and perhaps you esteem the noble President of the same class. F. The first four are the gentlemen to whom I allude; the other face is altogether neutral, and bespeaks a mind which neither affirms or denies, but seems to oscillate perpetually between the two sides of a question, and backs and fills like a ship lying off and on in a storm. A man“Who, now to sense, now nonsense leaning, “Means not, but blunders round about a meaning.” As is somewhere said of pretty nearly the same kind of person. But touching the other gentlemen, I suppose, you have nothing to say. P. Why truly sir, it is unpleasant to find blemishes like these in a picture in every other respect of finished excellence; but there are spots in the Sun. Besides, they have their use; for while, like vapours, they cast a shadow over the piece, they are a medium that adds lustre to the Halos with which the heads of their noble colleagues are adorned. F. That they shed a ray of respectability on the rest, I believe is truer than you designed to admit, and therefore I pray you throw them aside, pass them over in silence; for, should you condescend to eulogise such characters, ten to one, but they would repay your panegyric with ingratitude. You know what the philosopher says, “A garland wove by stupidity cannot sit easy on the head of a genius.” You would be still mingling your poppies and mandrakes in the wreath. P. Calm your apprehensions my dear friend, and, while I acknowledge your compliment, permit me to assure you, that I have ever held them unworthy of sharing the bright reward with those incomparable faces I mean to dignify with a plume of immortal verse: what the world calls men of understanding and propriety, can never possess that disseminating liberality of sentiment, for which it is a thorough paced demagogue's piety to pant, and which I shall ever esteem my highest praise to have promoted. You must now allow me to proceed with my task. Again, dear Muse, come mingle in the song, And bring some democratic friend along; Or black, or white, no matter, bond or free, Nay prithee sweet one do not frown on me; Yon asking jole, and saucy pleading eye So eloquently speak, who could deny? In some rude spot, not far from many a stew, From youth to bearded manhood Futtock grew, Still hand and glove with every sweep and fool, His tutor impudence, the streets his school. Grace to his soul no mellowing beam convey'd, His passions bloom'd and ripen'd in the shade, By wit untemper'd, unrestrain'd by sense, For men are virtuous in impertinence, Happy as stupid, in whate'er degree, The height of bliss is blank stupidity. As age increas'd, this doubt perplex'd his mind, Whether, or not he were of human kind; His mother's husband was a man 'tis true, His mother dear might be a woman too; But many a husband wears the lusty horn, And many a monster lives of woman born; And what to monsters shall prescribe a shape, Make that an Acephalus, this an Ape. Once from his sleepless straw, at break of day, With adz and maul, he took his pensive way, Deep ruminating on his doubtful kind, When lo! the river at his feet declin'd, Soon to the liquid glass his eye appli'd, He saw his monkey visage in the tide, Despairing saw, and sought the street, with speed, To ground his judgment on another's creed. And now the sun thro' eastern windows play'd, And 'woke to labour many a drowsy maid; Laugh'd at the laggard as he stole along And fill'd the pav'd-way with a busy throng; When Futtock, frantic for his luckless face, Seiz'd on a passenger and told his case. Friend, quoth the man, whatever beast you be, Your tongue and form extremely disagree; I've seen no ape with oral meaning blest, No man with bones so monkecally drest; But, e'er our final judgment we declare, Impart what animals your parents were. Both, gentle sir, responds the trembling elf, They both were human creatures like yourself; Again, e'er you to light and being came, Did never monkey fright your pregnant dame? Never. Your father? Yes, I heard him say, He saw them running wild in Africa. Enough, enough, enough! the stranger cries, You owe your figure to your fathers' eyes; Had he been blind, or hug'd his native place, A human form had blest his fond embrace; But, far from home, he cross'd the fearful main To forest deep, or monster haunted plain, Where, lifting up his curious eye, he saw A little monkey on the retina: And, thence transmitted to the pineal gland, He brought thy idea over sea and land: His appetency flames, in many a curve, The little image dances on the nerve, His wife impress'd, the embryon cub began, And lo! an ape begotten by a man: So oft by procreating fowls, is seen A lurking toad beneath the herbage green, Whose filthy shape the doating male alarms, And stamps a quadruped with all its charms. What tho' no tail, in dangling grace, appears To deck thy breech, yet calm thy rising fears; From the brief Os coccyges, we infer A signal Orang-Outang character. Anan! quoth Nat, his oxen eyes at rest, His fallen chop reposing on his breast, And fix'd each palsied puzzle'd member grew, For not one letter of one word he knew. But soon, a vent, his bursting griefs provide, He curs'd himself, and all the world beside; Apes, asses, monkeys, men his rage proscribes, By individuals some, and some by tribes. This sweet vociferation all admir'd, While some the nature of his woe enquired, Sooth'd with soft words, the wild tempestuous yell, And bore the hapless maniac to his cell. Why should I sing how there the friendly clan Declar'd, in very deed, he was a man To none inferior, in the least degree, On the broad scale of French equality: Suffice it, that his renovated frame Enjoy'd their counsel, and at length became A brawler brave at every factious fray, And great as garçon fendu in his way. This, as the group with annual touch refin'd, Not unobserv'd escap'd the S?h?k mind; In him our Artists saw their stamp confest, And drew his figure there among the rest. Where'er around your shifting optics burn, Some rising beauty greets them in its turn; Yon figure see, with thickest fogs begirt, That batch of tallow all belac'd with dirt, Where thou, dear Muse, may'st recognise the plan Of thy old island mooncalf Caliban. A butcher once, by grazing now he thrives, Is far more stupid than the ox he drives, Dead tho' he liveth, tho' a savage tame, A mule by nature, and Tom Belch by name: Him must the world detest; so let it be! What's filth to them, is frankincence to me. Should his swoln head and weeping nose declare, That too much blubber floats in quiet there, Where never knowledge casual entrance found To flash one glimmer on the dark profound; With fond delight I view the happy sign, And mark him in the register as mine. Behold each bloated muscle seems to say In ever drowsy stillness let me lay; And sleep so absolute within him reigns That the blood doses in his lazy veins, That, not contented with the nights regale, He slumbers cheerly at the bullock's tail. Abroad, at home, at table, in the straw, If, still this ruling passion is the law; And this one phrase his nature will define, That but to teach him is an anodyne; I own it all with measureless content, A sleeping man must still be innocent. Muse still delight me with thy song sublime, Translate yon Highland face to English rhyme; Make to the world Macgoggle's merit known, With all Lavater's spirit and thy own. Some thirty years, mid oakum tar and dirt, With fellow reptiles, and unfledg'd desert, This undistinguish'd grub escap'd our sight, That flutters now a beetle of the night. Fame now, to him, her ready hand bestows, And to her temple leads him by the nose; Where, treacherous grown, away the wanton flings, And leaves the puppet in his leading strings. Now here, now there, as trade and honor call He mounts the stage, or thunders in the Hall, Timber, and words, distorts a thousand ways, Now rips a bottom up, and now a phrase. What men by labour and attention gain, Full handed nature lavish'd on his brain, Gave him to act the rhetoricians part, To rise by instinct, and to curse by heart. Thus! thus accomplish'd he has got the knack To analyze an idea in a crack: Should, haply, something like a thought arise, A swarm of ragged words dispute the prize, And piece-meal, jointless, hither thither tost, The poor dismember'd notion yields the ghost. Once, with his subject warm'd, I heard him say, “The stones vindictive gallop'd o'er the dray, And that same dray, with more than mortal force, Burst nature's barrier, and o'erleap'd the horse This is, in substance, a fact, though somewhat ornamented by its present apparel; and is one of those rhetorical daisies for which this gentleman and his friend Verges are so remarkable..” What gems of eloquence are here display'd, Figures full dress'd, and thoughts in masquerade; What scenes of fancy on our senses ope, There roars a hyperbole, here squints a trope; And what great voice could e'er endue so quick With life a dray, or vivify a brick. Not wholly blest is man of woman born, The Ass, that crops the thistle, feels the thorn; When warm'd with lust, that passion unrefin'd, If husbands fear him, or if wives are kind, This thought his peace forever must annoy, They're slaves who fear him, wretches who enjoy. Lo! Sniffle speaks, with 'witching cadence blest, Hush every breeze, be every foot at rest; Suspend the tides, they roll alas! too loud, Stay the dread thunder in the kindling cloud, Let each fond planet loiter in its sphere, And every star of every system hear. What mortal e'er with darker brow appear'd? What mortal ever strok'd a stiffer beard? Looks, words, and gestures all consistent shine, A boar in prospect, and in speech a swine. Mark how he labours, like a qualmish pup Surcharg'd with prog, to pump his vomit up; Mark how his wezand learns to lisp, and roar In language utt'rance never knew before; And mark, oh mark! that trembling, lurking eye, Which light confounds, and nought can justify. But still, wherever seen, on land, or seas, Or thro' a pill'ry, still that face must please; That voice must charm, tho' every ear it meets Hawking old rags, old rags, about the streets; And all must that peculiar twitch prefer, Whether as shoe black, or as scavenger. Sniffle, the stupid shrug, the leer is thine, The vulgar wink, and methodistic whine; Securely, thou may'st innocence betray, Then flop thy ass's ears, and slink away; If two cant shreds of scripture, patly said, Will gag the mouths of censure, and the maid: But will they, Sniffle, while they bribe renown, Becalm the angry quills of conscience down? Happy are they who, tho' unsainted yet, Wear loose religion like a chemisette, Whose ample make leaves every action free, And casts a shade o'er each deformity. A jackdaw faith, mischievous, chatt'ring thing, Dress'd in a plume of every heathen's wing, Owns gods of commerce, beauty, gold and spunk, With christian Bacchus spiritually drunk. Oft have I seen a member of this crowd, In gospel language blasphemously loud, Who, while the tributary wheat he draws, Delights your tickled ears with holy straws. The lights extinct, and bar'd the cautious doors, Hid from all eyes, the midnight orgie roars; Where many a novice maiden learns to tell Of the new-birth, the first great principle. There Sniffle revels blest among the blest, At feasts of love who would not be a guest? Or, while his brothers loudly preach, and pray, Picks up his language for another day. As broken legs and arms, when set with care, Grow vastly stronger than they ever were, And as the uniform protects the man, So Sniffle, who can form a better plan, Sins now, and then, that he may be forgiven, And wears the national cockade of heaven. He thinks, should he the Infidel defraud, 'Twill hurt the devils' cause, and serve his God. To each stray brother, still he cries repent, Converts a sister with a fond intent, Keeps every christian law that serves his turn, And wenches rather than the flesh should burn: But should he find at last, by some disaster, “He cannot live by God, he'll change his master.” If Pan, Apollo's harp e'er whistled down, If Ballad-mongers ever charm'd the town, He, above all men, has the gift alone To bring an anthem down to Bob and Joan. Oft' have I seen, the whilst a hymn he'd troul, The mad'ning gutters all in concert roll; Seen list'ning cows forget to chew the cud, And pigs like dolphins tumble in the mud. With eyes up-turn'd, and paw upon her heart, I saw a cat with giddy rapture start, And an old dog, when far from home astray, Throw down his bone, and run for life away. Sniffle, farewell, defy the brow of shame, Thy friendly poet has embalm'd thy name; Thro' every kind of dirt perform'd the deed, Mine is the labour, thine the happy meed. Pardon me, noble President, I pray, Thy too long exile from the sprightly lay, Which soon will spread its insect wings, and sail With thee, all glowing, in its phosphor tail. Tho' many wonder how thou sound'st the way, Who art, God wot, no Solomon they say, To that great walk where ropes of law are twin'd, Curb hatters for the many headed hind, And thou a mighty silkworm of the train, Yarn from thy bowels spin'st, and not thy brain, Yet I thy Bard, with keen poetic eye Much legislative use in thee can spy: While some, as spinners, weave the long debate, Some work prepare, some turn the wheels of State, Thou and thy party, as a post, shall rise To bear one side the axle as it flies, And teach the ruin'd government to feel That rotten rests may topple down a wheel. Or else, a spoke, thro' the wide circle range, And be on either side as matters change. But not for thee the lyre alone is strung; Some worthy faces still remain unsung, Whom much I'm griev'd to slight, constrain'd alas! To give them just a friendly nod, and pass. The lives of these gentlemen are so shrouded in obscurity, that the reader must content himself with an imperfect exposition of their countenances, or the bare mention of their names: but if his curiosity remains unsatisfied, I recommend a visit to the Picture, where, possibly, his inquiries may be crowned with success. See Stripe, who loves the truant troop to flog, A striking portrait of a Pedagogue; Him, do the fates a lasting name decree, No cunning man, no necromancer he, And false it is, what wicked wits declare, The D?I help'd to cast his figure there. Next Gobbo Finis, on the left, appears, Frowns on the Group, and shakes his ass's ears; Whose temper, if aright his face I spell, Is harsh, discordant, and untunable. Gudgion, accept the comfort I impart To cheer thy drooping frame, for tho' thou art Mute as a Mack'rel, as a Flounder flat, I like thee, Gudgion, ne'er the less for that: Yet small this consolation! well I wot Thou'rt a Fish out of water, art thou not? Now Twist and Gluepot figure in the rear, No jot less noble than their Colleagues are; Like them they envy Virtue's modest crown, And join the cry to hunt all order down. When Britain, smarting for an Infant lost, Pour'd War's black tempest round our trembling coast, Deep, and more deep the gath'ring vapours croud, And Death's red standard glitter'd in the cloud. This did they see, and all the Jac'bin crew, Appall'd, to lurking holes of safety flew, While burst the din of battle on their ear, And in their coward caverns stunk for fear. The brave did then in many a phalanx join, And Justice gave new vigour to the line; Then did our Chieftain wave his warrious arm, “Ride in the whirlwind and direct the storm,” Thro' many a sleepless night and labour'd day Bring Glory, Happiness, and Peace away; While Sister Virtues fair, from every shore, Emboss'd the tributary wreath he wore, And Heav'n, his soul approving, stoop'd to hear The voice of Conscience sing so sweetly there. But danger past, the aggravated roar, Of hurtling War, and Carnage, heard no more, Why they could steal, in safety from their den, And bid each dastard hair lie smooth again; View his meridian beam with flutt'ring gaze, Or shut their orbs of darkness on the blaze. Could, ever anxious for the spoils of strife, Blaspheme their Country's dearest name, and life; Wing the black shaft, protrude their blades of lath, And spit their froth, and venom round his path. Thrice brilliant souls, to you each Gnome shall raise The shout of triumph, and the song of praise, And every Urchin of the dark abode Shall scatter wrecks of havock in your road. The Hour is hast'ning, when on equal feet Exalted Virtue, and low Vice shall meet; When Envy, Faction, Indolence shall rage, In one wild tempest, thro' the troubled age: Then human dignity shall meet it's doom, Devotion perish, Reason, Worth, a tomb, In the rude wastes of Ignorance, shall find, And true Equality shall bless Mankind. So when the Kamsin of the Desert flies 'Twixt ardent sands, and summer kindled skies, The gasping trav'ler meets the arid death, And, prostrate in the dust, resigns his breath. Then shall no pedant Priest, with learned pride, Point out the sacred volume for our guide; No more the civil law, or moral page, The arm shall fetter, or the soul encage; But pile on pile the File of Arts shall raise, And all the knowledge of all ages blaze. As when the Gothic conflagration hurl'd, Its smoky volumes round the sleeping world: The Friend of Ruin, with demoniac yell, Flits round the flame, directs the works of Hell, With sheets of sulphur wings the driving gale, And shakes destruction from his dragon tail. Yet, not as then: the once extinguish'd ray Shall ne'er resuscitate another day; Here, Science, thy last stage of being lies! No other Phenix, from thy dust, shall rise; And no sad vestige shall remain to tell, The temple's basis, where thou lov'dst to dwell. THE END.</field>
