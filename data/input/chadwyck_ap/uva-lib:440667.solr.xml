      <field name="fulltext">EPHEMERON. In the sphere of vast existenceâ Its beginning and its goal Lost in dim unmeasured distanceâ Dwells the solitary Soul. Longing for the light eternal, Through the gloom its footsteps bend. Though a gleam of Day Supernal On its darkness may descendâ Clouds terrestrial, shades infernal, Close around it to the end. Long ago 'twas said by Homer, Men are like the race of leavesâ Can Geneva or Saint Omer More assure a soul that grieves (Still from faith to doubt a roamer) O'er the little it receives? For there is but one thing certain, That the Earth will have her dueâ Bony fingers draw the curtain When the farce is fairly through. That the fount of life is flying Through our pulses, wave on waveâ And we are but slowly dying From the cradle to the grave. Human Love, and Tears, and Laughter, Haunt these fated dwellings nowâ Inconceivable Hereafter! What companionship hast thou? Dreary Riddle!âwho, by taking Thought, shall read thee?âmay we deem Life the sleep, and death the waking From a long distempered dream? Or, forlorn of its Ideal, Must the heart, in self-defence, Turn, for something that is real, To the joys of time and sense? Will it more, indeed, avail us Faith and reason to perplexâ Or, with wise Sardanapalus, Eat, and drink, and woo the Sex? What though, ever bending o'er us, Glooms a black and starless skyâ Let a jolly rouse restore us, Draining flask and flagon dry; Raise the catch, and roar the chorus, Fast and fierce while goblets flyâ Long the Night that lies before usâ Let us live until we die! Wine is physic meet for sadness, Impish Care from song must flit, Mirth is next of kin to gladnessâ Will the world outweigh a fit Of the fine celestial madness, Worth all wisdom and all witâ Which can make a common creature, Careless thousands might pass by, Dull of soulâand e'en in feature Irksome to a classic eyeâ Sovereign Empress of all nature, From the centre to the sky! Love is good, and so is Liquorâ Better still, methinks, the Weed! Soothing longer, kindled quicker, Trustier Fere in time of need. Lo, the wreath volute and taper, From its ashes spiral-curled, Born in fire, and lost in vapor, Floats, an emblem of the World. Spectral thus and evanescent All the splendor which thou seest; What is mightiest in the present, On the morrow may be leastâ Like yon pale imperial Crescent Waning in the stormy East. If the counter-charm of sorrows Lurks profound in Power or Fame, Let us live laborious morrowsâ Let us build a lofty Name! Kiss a long good-bye to Pleasure, Follow Fortune far and fastâ Eyes agape for rule or treasure, Nets in troubled waters castâ Harvest moonshine beyond measureâ But the end must come at last. If the morn of life has found us Happy in its milder raysâ If the fiery noon-tide crowned us With the glory of its blazeâ Darker shadows gather round us, In the evening of our days. Can the stoutest heart be cheery On a march to end like this? Yet a little, worn and weary, Every comrade thou shalt miss, On the pathway, stern and dreary, Leading to the vast Abyss. Past each sun-lit slope and meadowâ Under dead autumnal skies, In the Land of Dream and Shadow Deeper yet the journey lies. Still to seek the El Dorado That shall never meet our eyes. Fewer flowers are worth the gleaning, Drearier grows the Blasted Heathâ On we go, with listless meaning, Feebler footstep, fainter breathâ On a broken staff y-leaning, Slowly plodding on to death. Weary wayfarers from dawning, Calmly might we close our eyes, Could ye tell us that a Morning On our slumber shall arise! Hush the murmur unavailing, Breathed from too perturbed a breastâ Like a wayward infant's wailing, When it needs must go to rest. Would mere living on restore thee Hopes, that once were ever nigh? Think of those who died before thee, Think of those who yet shall die. Some there are thou canst remember, That might whisper words of powerâ In the silence of thy chamber, At the thoughtful midnight hour. Souls sublimed from sense and hating, Even in this terrene degreeâ Onceâhow noblyâanimating Dust and ashes! Can it be Thou in some far world art waiting, Thou that once wast all to me? In the depth of grief is lurking Truth divineâand man might draw Strength and comfort from the working Of the ever-constant Law. Standing on eternal mountains, Lifted from the plane of strifeâ Bathed in the o'erflowing fountains Of the Universal Lifeâ Hast thou not, in pure elation Born of Nature grand and free, Felt the glow of inspiration Shedding glimpses, e'en to thee, Of the glory of Creation, And the Joy that yet shall be? And the troubled heart is firmerâ And the sighing lips are dumbâ At the deep, prophetic murmur Of the Wondrous Age to come. Hear, with solemn, hushed emotion, Where, in distant thunder, beat Waves of the advancing Ocean Soon to lave our very feet. Through these early mists of morningâ Thrilling from the Unseen Shore, Voices of august forewarning Mingle with its endless roar; And a mighty Day is dawning, Such as never shone before! Lo, the long-unopened Portal On its threshold trembling stands! Through the ancient Shadow Curtal, Yet dividing these our Lands, They that once, like us, were mortal, Reach their dear remembered hands. Hopes undreamed shall those inherit, That are faithful to the endâ Death with Life, and Clay with Spirit, Shall converse, as friend with friend. Souls that erst, forlorn and lowly. Sat in darkness and dismay, Shall admire their melancholyâ Seeing every doubt decay In the Light, serene and holy, Of the Everlasting Day. Lo, the dream Earth's children cherish, In forgetting what they are! But, meanwhile, we faint and perish For the Fount that lies afar. God hath spoken, Christ hath risen, Saints have dwelt and died belowâ Yet the World is still a Prison, Full of wrong, and full of woe! Such as Rome's unhappy debtors, In her height of glory, knewâ Lodged in darkness and in fetters, Toiling for the lordly Few. In those dismal Ergastula, Dungeoned from the glimmering day, Shall each sullen turnkey-ruler Hold his wretched thralls for aye? Tremble, tyrants! Earth is waking Like the Strong Man from his sleep! Withe, and cord, and chain are breaking, Ye had knotted fast and deepâ Ye, that sowed the windânow quaking At the whirlwind ye shall reap! A. D. 1848â9 Tremble, tyrant!âthou that seest On thy wall the Hand Unknown! Tremble, false and cursing priest! Rule and awe thine ends aloneâ Dreams of vague, bewildered deist, Haply, purer than thine own. Still of creed and form observant, Ever harping on the Wordâ But, alas, how little fervent For the Deed that must accordâ Thou unprofitable servant In the Garden of thy Lord! All is lost!âtheir hour mistaken, Truth and Right once more must flee. Throne and Mitreâbravely shakenâ Fixed in bloody triumph, see! And the world again must waken From the Dream that man was free. Oule OneirÃ©!âEvil Vision! â????? ???, ???? ?????? â????? ???? ???????? ?????????ââ ???????. ?. Twice in anger sent to tell Earth thy tale of Hope Elysian, But the slumber to dispel With a burst of fierce derision From the lowest fiends of hell! Now, the shattered clouds dispersing, On this sombre stage behold The same wretched mimes, rehearsing DamnÃ©d tragedies of old. Mark each petty, bustling agent Draw the curtain, shift the scene, To present the doleful pageant Every age in turn hath been. Yet, the Soul through time that rambles, Threading, in her tortuous way, The interminable shambles Men call historyâshall survey All its horrors mere preambles To the butchery of to-day. False of heart, of front defiant, Two vile Shapes, in crown and cowl, On their ancient craft reliant, Sharp-eyed pigmies, cheek by jowl, Drive yon blinded, stumbling Giant To his labor fierce and foulâ Grieving, groaning, yet compliantâ Luckless, day-bewildered owl. Strong of arm, of brain how feeble! The âPeoples,â (the Universal Yankee Nation, of course, always excepted,) have now, for a long time, approved themselves, as it were. âDarbyshire born, and Darbyshire bred, Strong i' th' yarn, and weak i' th' yead.â Let it be hoped that, as their heads become clearer, their arms may be found none the less strong. This your tyrants know too well. Toil and die, unhappy People! That some paltry triumph swellâ Every clang from tower and steeple Sounding Freedom's mortal knell. From the farthest dale of Annan To the dead lagoons of Aigueâ From the Dnieper to the Shannonâ From the Pyrenees to Pragueâ Ye are come, as food for cannon, âChair Ã¡ canon.â Come, as victual for the Plague. Hard your hands, your hearts enduringâ Let yon Tartar plain be tilled! Here are fields that want manuringâ Here's a trench that must be filled! Rest at last is sweet from labor. Yours shall be, how long and deep! Home, and wife, and child, and neighbor, Haunt no more that dreamless sleep. Where, in hues of flame and opal, Burns the oriental sky Over old Constantinopleâ Spreads a vaster City nigh. There is rest from SevastÃ³polâ Rest, and room for all to lie. France and Englandâhow the laurel From each haughty brow is hurled! Names that, in a nobler quarrel, Might have stood against the world. Many an age hath armed Orion Paced his nightly round in pride, Since the Lily and the Lion, 'Gainst the Crescent-Moon allied. On the walls of rescued Zion Floated proudly, side by side. At demented feud no longer, Forced at last to join your hands By a Foe grown daily stronger On the spoil of injured landsâ Ye, that spared the mighty Wronger, Draw too late your rusted brands. Woe to Albion! plundered Sweden Keel and mast and sail supplies, That shall waft him to the Eden Of your Indian shores and skies. Woe to Gaul! the Sword of Roland Should have cloven shield and helm, Ere ye saw the Wreck of Poland Yon Barbarian Tide o'erwhelm. Woe to each! that idly waited, While those foul Twin-Vultures tore The bold Magyar's heart, and sated Beak and talon deep with goreâ Thou unmoved, and thou elated, When its pulses throbbed no more! Ye that, awed from generous duties, To the savage Cyclops coweredâ Start to find yourselves, like Outis, But the last to be devoured. â????? ??? ??????? ?????? ???? ??? ????????? ???? ?? ?????? ???????ââ ?????????. ?. What your meed, forlorn Aspirants For the wrong of less degree? Scorn from more consistent tyrantsâ Grief and pity from the free. May the Waning Moon wax stronger While a new eclipse she sees? Shall the Sick Man dread no longer His Physiciansâand their fees? Can the Peoples' gratulations Hail a rival yoke o'erthrown From the neck of distant nations, While your heel is on their own? With your pÃ¦ans still shall mingle Sighs of miserable men, From Australia's arid shingleâ From the marsh of foul Cayenne. Exile, Prison, Execution, Tried in turn, perchance in vainâ Ever scenting retribution, Ye must watch, in sleepless pain, Lest the hydra, Revolution, Wake to horrid life again. Gain to swell, defeat to soften, Teach the lightning's tongue to lieâ Lest it tell thee, France, too often, How thy hapless children die. Thou the bitter truth must garble, While distrusting Paris readsâ Great Napoleon's brow of marble Flushing 'neath the Invalides. If the Shade of Honor lingers Round that hero-haunted dome, First unlock those robber fingers From the gasping throat of Rome! Dead to shame, and deaf to reason! First avert that threatening eye, Guarding crowned, anointed Treason 'Gainst the glaive of Italy. There, where echo-tongued Nerano Mocks a captive city's moanâ Where the deep unquenched volcano Smoulders 'neath a despot's throneâ Where Navarro's victims languish In their dungeons of the seaâ Lone Procida's caves of anguish, Dens of old accursed Capri. Thanks to Mr. Gladstone, the world is tolerably well informed of the atrocities perpetrated by the Neapolitan government. On authority less eminent, one could hardly have believed in the possibility of twenty thousand persons confined for political offences, in the vicinity of a single capitalâof the shameless infamy of the chief judge, Navarroâof the horrors of the Vicaria and of Nisidaâof the Maschio of Ischia, where men are buried alive, twenty-four feet beneath the level of the seaâof Procida, where a hundred and seventy-five prisoners were massacred by hand-grenades thrown among their crowded masses. These facts, unquestionably, at the time, were fully in possession of the two allied governments, a word from either of which would have been all powerful with the court of Naplesâbut not a finger was raised in behalf of the noble Poerio or his suffering companions. âIf it be confessed, it is not redressedââand indeed, the vague impertinence of the Neapolitan semi-official reply can be paralleled only by that of Falstaff himselfââYou hear all these matters deniedâyou hear it, gentlemen.â And for thee, our Ancient Mother! By the Spectre of the Past Long estranged from one anotherâ We were drawing near at last. Not an honest ear but hearkened Coldly to report malignâ Owning our escutcheon darkened With a stain as deep as thine. Not a generous heart but tasted Kindred griefâand made its moan O'er the splendid Valor wasted, And the blood so near our own. But the bond can close no further, Till thy mien we may forget, No respectable American, I am sure, but witnessed with sincere pleasure the final union, after an almost suicidal delay, of the two most civilized nations of Europe. But this pleasure was speedily dampened by the covert insinuation of the French government, and the insolent announcement of the English press, that the affairs of this hemisphere were thenceforth to be regulated by their joint interference. Hand and glove with prosperous Murtherâ Courting fouler co-mates yet. Years to comeâof shame or gloryâ All this bloody harvest reapedâ Never tell your sons the story, How the heart of England leaped, Leaped in wretched exultation O'er a pale majestic Foe, 'Mid an Empire's lamentation, By the Viewless Hand laid low. While he rules, the Man of Violence Brave with free unbated breath; But ye might have paused in silence At the Majesty of Death. To dance on the grave of an adversary has ever been accounted a pitiful piece of satisfactionâyet something very like this has Britannia been doing, if the press and the theatre are fair exponents of public feeling. Her demonstrations have been a little too much in the humor of Moliere's police, enraged at the mischievous Polichinelle and his pretended arsenal of weaponsâ ââcoquin, filou, voleur! Vous osez nous faire peur!â âThe villain! who has dared to alarm us!â (they proceed to beat him.) Saddest of all is it to see our old friend, Mr. Punch, whom we have always used to regard as a very saint, to venerate as the chiefest pillar in the whole fabric of British liberty, to defer to, in short, as the Fifth Estate of Englandâto see him, at his time of life, taking office under a government in exposing which nearly the whole of it has been spentâcaricaturing (literally) the Corpse of that tremendous Enemy whom England, so little time ago, welcomed as her staunchest friendâand abasing himself, in complimentary verse, before the man whose person and whose deeds he has so perseveringly pilloried and pelted, and whose nose was the only ill feature in the case, which he could by any possibility exaggerate. A constitution torn in tatters, like a writ by a stout criminalâa couple of thousand blouses, scattered about the Boulevards, and dyed in the old approved mixture of blood and âboue de Parisââ are coolly disposed of in the precious couplet, âFor oathsâwhat King e'er kept them, when Policy said âbreak!â If precedents can justify, defence is soon to make.â Perhaps it isâbut you, Master Punch, are not exactly the man to make itâcertainly not, until you can do it in better rhyme and more coherent reason. 'Tis a dog's trick you have played us, and shall long be remembered of you. After this, who can be blamed for renouncing all faith in virtue? Of the rest, it might have been expected, butâtu Punche! It was the drop too muchâthe drop of thee, oh Punch, with thy spirits and thine acid omitted (like Hamlet) by particular requestânothing but sugar allowedâand best sugar at thatâmere eau sucrec of a Punch that thou art! Nominis Umbra! Ghost of a Punch! leave patting this live dog, and kicking that dead lion, and be our own dear, good, brave, honest, witty, magnanimous Punch again! Now, to people His vast Valleys, Look in vain for further help. Torn and bleedingâEngland rallies, Bravely, her âunconquered whelp.ââ Fierce her Ape-and-Tiger alliesâ Shrill Sardinia's terrier yelp. While the mighty Northern Bruin, The curious in vaticination are referred to some remarkable verses of Thomas Campbell, entitled âThe Power of Russia.â Prompted by the final supression of Polish nationality, they predict the present conjuncture in terms so clear and eloquent as to afford a fresh illustration of the force of the ancient nomenclature, which applied the single epithetâVatesâalike to the poet and the prophet. Couched within his sullen cave, Sucks his paws, and plots the ruin Of the pack that round it rave; That, with careless courage burning, Gather to the Grave of Menâ Soon, with doubt and dread, discerning, As they near the horrid den, All the footsteps inward turningâ None reverting forth agen. Come, ye rugged sons of slavery!â By conscription's ruthless call, Or enlistment's shallow knavery. Trapped or huntedâone and all, Come, with blind and brutal bravery, Dash your heads against a wall! Ranks in savage razzia schoolÃ©d, Waste their lessons. Pelissier! These are not the Caves of Ouledâ Furze and faggot boot not here. Few readers of these lines can have forgotten one of the most frightful incidents of modern warfare. On the 18th of June, 1846, a tribe of Arabs, pursued by the French, under Colonel Pelissier, took refuge in the intricate caverns of Ouled-Riah. Unable to compel a surrender, the savage commander resolved to burn or stifle them. For many hours, an immense fire, constantly fed with fresh combustibles, roared within the entrance. As it was permitted to subside, the French soldiery, at the hazard of their lives, dashed into the furnace, and drew forth the charred and contorted bodies of nine hundred victimsâmen, women and children. About two hundred still breathedâbut all perished in the course of the day. For this piece of energy, the French commander was censuredâand promoted. London journalism, which then foamed at the mouth, and exhausted the vocabulary of horror, is now seen complacently anticipating that he may find âsome means equally efficientâ for disposing of the defenders of Sevastopol. The Illustrated News (June 23d) suggests the propriety of putting them all to the swordâwhen the place is taken. Perhaps it would be as well to wait till that event occurs. Meanwhile, General Pelissier might profitably pass his time in conning a little treatise, quaint but sound, entitled âGod's Revenge upon Murther.â If he is to be ennobled for his exploits, ancient or recent, a motto appropriate to either, will doubtless be selectedâ âE fulgore fumum.â Banded Empires!âstern and lonelyâ Blind to that ye will not see! Such a knot is severed only By the hand unmeshed and free. Canst thou not, oh France, remember How thine Eagles, once unfurled By the Men of fierce September, Swept in triumph through the world? Spite of deeds grotesque and tragicâ. Such the glory of a Name! Freedom!â'tis a sound of magic. Though to end in dust and shame. Speak the Word! and ere its thunder Shall have died across the deep, To your aid, in joy and wonder, Shall a million swords outleap! Hear it, hushing meaner clamors, Echoed from surrounding lands, In the clang of countless hammers Forging fetters into brands. Through the Regions of the Vulture Let it ring with vengeful force, Where, in bloody, cold sepulture, Lies Hungaria's mailÃ©d corse. Buried quick, the dreaded Vampyre See the very extraordinary report of a surgical and military commission, made about a century since, on the subject of Vampyrism in Hungary or some province adjacentâ(many of the victims, I remember, were âhey dukes.)â The so-called Vampyres, it would appear, were buried alive, in a state of epidemic trance, and their neighbors complained of being grievously haunted by their appearances. A number of them were exhumed, (some after a burial of many weeks,) and exhibited signs of life, in fresh blood at the lips, and in cries and groans, when their heads were cut off, or when a stake was driven through them, as they revived. The Anglo-French alliance seems desirous of pursuing a similar course of treatment toward any revival of Hungarian nationality. Vide Lord Palmerston's remarks on the subject, and the general attitude of the two governments, and of the presses of their respective capitals. From his grave shall start amain. And that Shield, so long the Rampire Of the West, shall lift again! Deathless Poland!âwhat though rusted Long in fetters of the Foe! That brave arm may yet be trusted For a noble, trenchant blow. Thou, Italia, thou shalt waken, With the grandeur once thine ownâ In exultant earthquake shaken From Calabria to the Rhone. From thy grass-grown courts, Ferrara, To Palermo's shattered wall, Perjured crown and towered tiara In resounding wreck shall fall. Ancient Nurse of rugged Freedom! Mother of the Mighty Dead! Let yon grasping Sons of Edom Tremble at thine armÃ©d treadâ At the thunder of thy Legions Hurling Hun and Vandal forth, As of yore, into the regions Of their savage native North. Suchâtheir shackles dashed in sunderâ Yet might join the valiant West, Join to beat the Birds of Plunder Back to their polluted Nest. But ye needs must pause and palter With a crew, whose hearts the voice Of an angel would not alter From their safely selfish choice. Spiced with high considerations, Gales of diplomatic breath Woo the long-reluctant nations Still, to join the Dance of Death. But the Thunderer's daily sermon, Droning in his drowsy ear, Fails to rouse the sullen German From his quiet pipe and beer. Long the injured Dane shall ponder, Feeling yet the ancient smart Of the double scar left yonder Deep in Copenhagen's heart. Long shall Prussia, bat-like, linger, Lest she side against the strongâ Long ere Sweden lift a finger To avenge an age of wrong. And the Vassal of the Kremlin, Plying long his perjured trade, Still shall keep, from loop-holed Semlin, Cat-like watch on high Belgrade; That, when Ãsop's Bear and Lion, Wearied with their savage playâ Claws of brass and teeth of iron Broken in the murderous frayâ Each his panting side shall lie onâ Sir Fox may bear the prize away! Lord, how longâthy pure Evangels Still perverted or betrayedâ In the sight of men and angels Shall this bloody game be played? Shall the Host, sublimely seated 'Mid the clear celestial chimes, Through this ether, dim and fetid With the breath of countless crimes, See the same vile farce repeated O'er and o'er a thousand times? Haply, dwelling higher, nearer To the calm eternal Planâ Far beyond these clouds of error, Pure Intelligences scan Worlds undimmed by hate or terrorâ But the darkened eye of man Sees the dreary light illuming Haunts of Anguish, Fear, and Blameâ Sees the mirk horizon fuming From the Fires that none may nameâ All the Past in horror glooming, All the Present woe and shame, And the Future dimly looming Through a mist of blood and flame. August 15th, 1855.</field>
