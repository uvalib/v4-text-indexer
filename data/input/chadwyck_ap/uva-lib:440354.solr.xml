      <field name="fulltext">SECTION I THE âTRIFLES IN RHYMEâ COLLECTION The Culprit Fay âMy visual orbs are purged from film, and lo! Instead of Anster's turnip-bearing vales I see old fairy land's miraculous show! Her trees of tinsel kissed by freakish gales, Her Ouphs that, cloaked in leaf-gold, skim the breeze, And fairies, swarming thick as mites in rotten cheese.â TENNANT'S ANSTER FAIR I 'Tis the middle watch of a summer's nightâ The earth is dark, but the heavens are bright; Nought is seen in the vault on high But the moon, and the stars, and the cloudless sky, And the flood which rolls its milky hue, A river of white on the welkin blue. The moon looks down on old Cronest, She mellows the shades on his shaggy breast, And seems his huge gray form to throw In a silver cone on the waves below; His sides are broken by spots of shade, By the walnut bough and the cedar made, And through their clustering branches dark Glimmers and dies the fire-fly's sparkâ Like starry twinkles that momently break Through the rifts of the gathering tempest rack. II The stars are on the moving stream, And fling, as its ripples gently flow, A burnished length of wavy beam In an eel-like, spiral line below; The winds are whist and the owl is still, The bat in the shelvy rock is hid, And nought is heard on the lonely hill But the cricket's chirp, and the answer shrill Of the gauze-winged katydid; And the plaint of the wailing whippoorwill, Who mourns unseen, and ceaseless sings, Ever a note of wail and woe, Till morning spreads her rosy wings, And earth and sky in her glances glow. III 'Tis the hour of fairy ban and spell; The wood-tick has kept the minutes well; He has counted them all with click and stroke, Deep in the heart of the mountain oak; And he has awakened the sentry elve Who sleeps with him in the haunted tree, To bid him ring the hour of twelve, And call the fays to their revelry; Twelve small strokes on his tinkling bellâ ('Twas made of the white snail's pearly shell) âMidnight comes and all is well! Hither Goblins wing your way! 'Tis the dawn of the fairy day.â IV They come from beds of lichen green, They creep from the mullen's velvet screen; Some on the backs of beetles fly From the silver tops of moon-touched trees, Where they swung in their cobweb hammocks high, And rocked about in the evening breeze; Some from the hum-bird's downy nestâ They had driven him out by elfin power, And pillowed on plumes of his rainbow breast, Had slumbered there till the charmed hour; Some had lain in a scoop of the rock, With glittering ising-stars inlaid; And some had opened the four-o'clock, And stole within its purple shade. And now they throng to the moonlight glade, Aboveâbelowâon every side, Their little minim forms arrayed In the tricksy pomp of fairy pride. V They come not now to print the lea, In freak and dance around the tree, Or at the mushroom board to sup, And drink the dew from the buttercup; A scene of sorrow waits them now, For an Ouphe has broken his vestal vow; He has loved an earthly maid, And left for her his woodland shade; He has lain upon her lips of dew, He has sunned him in her eye of blue, He has fanned her cheek with his wing of air, And played in the ringlets of her hair, And, nestling on her snowy breast, Forgot the lily-king's behest. For this the shadowy tribes of air, To the elfin court must haste away; And now they stand expectant there, To hear the doom of the culprit fay. VI The throne was reared upon the grass, Of the spice wood and the sassafras; On pillars of mottled tortoise-shell Hung the burnished canopyâ And o'er it gorgeous curtains fell Of the tulip's crimson drapery. The monarch sat on his judgment-seat, On his brow the crown imperial shone, The prisoner fay was at his feet, And his peers were ranged around the throne. He waved his sceptre in the air, He looked around and calmly spoke; His brow was grave and his eye severe, But his voice in a softened accent broke: VII âFairy! Fairy! list and markâ Thou hast broke thy elfin chain, Thy flame-wood lamp is quenched and dark, And thy wings are dyed with a deadly stain; Thou hast sullied thine elfin purity In the glance of a mortal maiden's eye; Thou hast scorned our dread decree, And thou shouldst pay the forfeit high; But well I know her sinless mind Is pure as the angel forms above, Gentle and meek, and chaste and kind, Such as a spirit well might love; Spirit! had she spot or taint, Bitter had been thy punishment. Tied to the hornet's shardy wings, Tossed on the pricks of nettle stings, Or seven long ages doomed to dwell With the lazy worm in the walnut-shell; Or every night to writhe and bleed Beneath the tread of the centipede; Or bound in a cobweb dungeon dim, Your jailor a spider huge and grim, Amid the carrion bodies to lie, Of the worm, and the bug, and the murdered flyâ These it had been your lot to bear, Had a stain been found on the earthly fair. Now list, and mark our mild decreeâ Fairy! this your doom must be: VIII âThou shalt seek the beach of sand Where the water bounds the elfin land; Thou shalt watch the oozy brine Till the sturgeon leaps in the bright moonshine, Then dart the glistening arch below, And catch a drop from his silver bow. The water-sprites will wield their arms And dash around, with roar and rave, And vain are the woodland spirits' charms, They are the imps that rule the wave. Yet trust thee in thy single might, If thy heart be pure and thy spirit right, Thou shalt win the warlock fight.â IX âIf the spray-bead gem be won, The stain of thy wing is washed away, But another errand must be done Ere thy crime is lost for aye; Thy flame-wood lamp is quenched and dark, Thou must re-illume its spark. Mount thy steed and spur him high To the heaven's blue canopy; And when thou seest a shooting star, Follow it fast and follow it farâ The last faint spark of its burning train Shall light thy fairy fire again. Thou hast heard our sentenceâsay, Elf! to the water-side, away!â X The goblin marked his monarch well; He spoke no word, but he bowed him low, Then plucked a crimson colen-bell, And turned him round in act to go. The way is long, he cannot fly, His soiled wing has lost its power, And he wends down the mountain high, For many a sore and weary hour. Through dreary beds of tangled fern, Through groves of nightshade dark and dern, Over the grass and through the brake, Where toils the ant and sleeps the snake; Now on the violet's azure flush He skips along in lightsome mood; And now he thrids the bramble bush, Till its points are dyed in fairy blood. He has leapt the bog, he has pierced the brier, He has swum the brook, and waded the mire, Till his spirit sank, and his limbs grew weak, And the red waxed fainter in his cheek. He had fallen to the ground outright, For rugged and dim was his onward track, But there came a spotted toad in sight, And he laughed as he jumped upon her back. He bridled her mouth with a silk-weed twist; He lashed her side with an osier thong; And now through evening's dewy mist, With leap and spring they bound along, Till the mountain's magic verge is past, And the beach of sand is reached at last. XI Soft and pale is the moony beam, Moveless still the glassy stream, The wave is clear, the beach is bright With snowy shells and sparkling stones; The shore-surge comes in ripples light, In murmurings faint and distant moans; And ever anon in the silence deep Is heard the splash of the sturgeon's leap, And the bend of his graceful bow is seenâ A glistening arch of silver sheen, Spanning the wave of burnished blue, And dripping with gems of the river dew. XII The elfin cast a glance around, As he lighted down from his courser toad, Then round his breast his wings he wound, And close to the river's brink he strode; He sprang on a rock, he prayed a prayer, Above his head his hands he threw, Then tossed a tiny curve in air, And headlong plunged in the waters blue. XIII Upsprung the spirits of the wave, From sea-silk beds in their coral cave, With snail-plate armor snatched in haste, They speed their way through the liquid waste; Some are rapidly borne along On the mailed shrimp or the prickly prong, Some on the blood-red leeches glide, Some on the stony star-fish ride, Some on the back of the lancing squab, And some on the sideling soldier-crab; And some on the jellied quarl, who flings At once a thousand streamy stingsâ They cut the wave with the living oar And hurry on to the moonlight shore, To guard their realm and chase away The footsteps of the invading fay. XIV Fearlessly he skims along, His hope is high, and his limbs are strong, He spreads his arms like the swallow's wing, And he throws his feet with a frog-like fling; His locks of gold on the waters shine, At his breast the puny foam-beads rise, His back gleams bright above the brine, And the wake-line foam behind him lies. But the water-sprites are gathering near To check his course along the tide; Their warriors come in swift career And hem him round on every side; On his thigh the leech has fixed his hold, The quarl's long arms are round him rolled, The prickled prong has pierced his skin, The squab has thrown his javelin, The gritty star has rubbed him raw, And the crab has struck with his giant claw; He howls with rage, and he shrieks with pain, He strikes around, but his blows are vain; Hopeless is the unequal fight, Fairy! nought is left but flight. XV He turned around and fled amain With hurry and dash to the beach again; He twisted over from side to side, He laid his cheek to the cleaving tide. The strokes of his plunging arms are fleet, And with all his strength he flings his feet, But the water-sprites are around him still, To cross his path and to work him ill. They bade the rock before him rise, They flung the sea-fire in his eyes, They stunned his ears with the scallop stroke, With the porpoise heave and the drum-fish croak. Oh! but a weary wight was he When he reached the foot of the dog-wood tree; Gashed and wounded, stiff and sore, He laid him down on the sandy shore; He blessed the force of the charmed line, And he banned the water-goblin's spite, For he saw around in the sweet moonshine, Their little wee faces above the brine, Giggling and laughing with all their might At the piteous hap of the fairy wight. XVI Soon he gathered the balsam dew From the sorrel leaf and the henbane bud; Over each wound the balm he drew, And with cobweb lint he staunched the blood. The mild west wind was soft and low, It cooled the heat of his burning brow, And he felt new life in his fibres shoot, As he sucked the juice of the cal'mus root; And now he treads the fatal shore, As fresh and vigorous as before. XVII Wrapped in musing stands the sprite, 'Tis the middle wane of night, His task is hard, the ways are far, But he must do his errand right Ere dawning mounts her beamy car, And rolls her chariot wheels of light; And vain are the spells of fairy-land, He must work with a human hand. XVIII He cast a saddened eye around, And what to do he could not tell; But he leapt with joy when on the ground, He saw a purple mussel-shell; Thither he ran, and he bent him low, He heaved at the stern and he heaved at the bow, And he pushed her over the yielding sand, Till he came to the verge of the haunted land. She was as lovely a pleasure boat As ever fairy had paddled in, For she glowed with purple paint without, And shone with silvery pearl within; A sculling notch in the stern he made, An oar he shaped of the bootle blade; Then sprung to his seat with a lightsome leap, And launched afar on the calm blue deep. XIX The imps of the river yell and rave; They had no power above the wave, But they heaved the billow before the prow, And they dashed the surge against her side, And they struck her keel with jerk and blow, Till her gunwale bent to the rocking tide. She wimpled about in the pale moonbeam, Like a feather that floats on a wave-tossed stream; And momently athwart her track The quarl upreared his island back, And the fluttering scallop behind would float, And spatter the water about the boat; But he bailed her out with his colen-bell, And he kept her trimmed with a wary tread, While on every side like lightning fell The heavy strokes of the bootle blade. XX Onward still he held his way, Till he came where the column of moonshine lay, And saw beneath the surface dim The brown-backed sturgeon slowly swim; Around him were the goblin trainâ But he sculled with all his might and main, And followed wherever the sturgeon led, Till he saw him upward point his head; Then he dropped his paddle blade, And held his colen goblet up To catch the drop in its crimson cup. XXI With sweeping tail and quivering fin, Through the wave the sturgeon flew, And, like the heaven-shot javelin, He sprung above the waters blue. Instant as the star-fall light, He plunged him in the deep again, But left in shining silver bright, The rainbow of the moony main. It was a sweet and lovely sight To see the puny goblin there; He seemed an angel form of light, With azure wing and sunny hair, Throned on a cloud of purple fair, Circled with blue and edged with white, And sitting at the fall of even Beneath the bow of summer heaven. XXII A momentâand its lustre fell, But ere it met the billow blue, He caught within his crimson bell, A droplet of its sparkling dew. Joy thee, fay! thy task is done, Thy wings are pure, for the gem is won; Cheerly ply thy dripping oar, And haste away to the elfin shore. XXIII He turns, and lo! on either side The ripples on his path divide; And the track o'er which his boat must pass Is smooth as a sheet of polished glass. Around, their limbs the sea-nymphs lave, With snowy arms half swelling out, While on the glossed and gleamy wave Their sea-green ringlets loosely float; They swim around with smile and song, They press the bark with pearly hand, And gently urge her course along, Toward the beach of speckled sand; And, as he lightly leapt to land, They bade adieu with nod and bow, Then gaily kissed each little hand, And dropped in the crystal deep below. XXIV A moment stayed the fairy there, He kissed the beach and breathed a prayer, Then spread his wings of gilded blue, And on to the elfin court he flew. As ever ye saw a bubble rise, And shine with a thousand blended dyes, Till lessening, far through ether driven, It mingles with the hues of heaven. As, at the glimpse of dawning pale, The lance-fly spreads his silken sail, And gleams with blendings soft and bright, Till lost in the shades of fading night; So rose from earth the lovely fay, So vanished, far in heaven away! Up fairy! quit thy chickweed bower, The cricket has called the second hour, Twice again, and the lark will rise To kiss the streakings of the skies; Up! thy charmed armor don, Thou wilt need it ere the night be gone. XXV He put his acorn helmet on; It was plumed with the silk of the thistle-down. The corslet plate that guarded his breast Was once the wild bee's golden vest; His cloak, of a thousand mingled dyes, Was formed of the wings of butterflies; His shield was the shell of a lady-bug queen, Studs of gold on a ground of green; And the quivering lance which he brandished bright, Was the sting of a wasp he had slain in fight. Swift he bestrode his fire-fly steed, He bared his blade of the bent grass blue, He drove his spurs of the cockle-seed, And away like a glance of thought he flew, To skim the heavens and follow far The fiery trail of the rocket-star. XXVI The moth-fly, as he shot the air, Crept under the leaf, and hid her there; The katydid forgot to bray, The prowling gnat fled fast away, The fell mosquito checked his drone And folded his wings until the fay was gone, And the wily beetle dropped his head, And fell on the ground as if he were dead; They couched them close in the darksome shade, They quaked all o'er and they sweat with fear, For they had felt the blue bent blade, And writhed at the prick of the elfin spear; Many a time on a summer's night, When the sky was clear and the moon was bright, They had been roused from the haunted ground, With the yelp and the bay of the fairy hound; They had heard the tiny bugle horn, They had heard the twang of the maize-silk string, When the vine-twig bows were tightly drawn, And the nettle shaft through air was borne, Feathered with down from the hum-bird's wing. And now they deemed the courier ouphe Some hunter sprite of the eildrich ground; And they watched till they saw him mount the roof That canopies the world around; Then glad they left their covert lair, And freaked about in the midnight air. XXVII Up to the vaulted firmament His path the fire-fly courser bent, And at every gallop on the wind, He flung a glittering spark behind; He flies like a feather in the blast Till the first light cloud in heaven is past, But the shapes of air have begun their work, And a drizzly mist is round him cast, He cannot see through the mantle murk, He shivers with cold, but he urges fast, Through storm and darkness, sleet and shade, He lashes his steed and spurs amain, For shadowy hands have twitched the rein, And flame-shot tongues around him played, And near him many a fiendish eye Glared with a fell malignity, And yells of rage, and shrieks of fear, Came screaming on his startled ear. XXVIII His wings are wet around his breast, The plume hangs dripping from his crest, His eyes are blind with the lightning's glare, And his ears are stunned with the thunder's blare; But he gave a shout, and his blade he drew, He thrust before and he struck behind, Till he pierced their cloudy bodies through, And gashed their shadowy limbs of wind; Howling, the misty spectres flew; They rend the air with spiteful cries, For he has gained the welkin blue, And the land of clouds behind him lies. XXIX Up to the cope careering swift In breathless motion fast, Fleet as the swallow cuts the drift Or the sea-roc rides the blast, The sapphire sheet of eve is shot, The sphered moon is past, The earth it seems a tiny blot On a sheet of azure cast. And oh! it was sweet in the clear moonlight, To tread the starry plain of even, To mark the thousand eyes of night, And feel the cooling breath of heaven. But the elfin made no stop nor stay Till he came to the bank of the milky-way, Then he checked his courser's foot, And watched for the glimpse of the planet-shoot. XXX Sudden along the snowy tide Which swelled to meet their footfall, The sylphs of heaven are seen to glide, Attired in sunset's crimson pall; Around the fay they weave the dance, They skip before him on the plain, And one hath taken his wasp-sting lance, And one upholds his bridle rein; With warblings wild they led him on To where, through clouds of amber seen, Studded with stars, resplendent shone The palace of the sylphid queen. Its spiral columns gleaming bright Were streamers of the northern light; Its curtain's light and lovely flush Was of the morning's rosy blush, And the ceiling fair that rose aboon The white and feathery fleece of noon. XXXI But oh! how fair the shape that lay Beneath a rainbow bending bright, She seemed to the entranced fay The loveliest of the forms of light; Her mantle was the purple rolled At twilight in the west afar; 'Twas tied with threads of dawning gold, And buttoned with a sparkling star. Her face was like the lily rune That hides the vestal planet's hue; Her eyes two beamlets from the moon, Set floating in the welkin blue. Her hair is like the sunny beam, And the diamond gems which round it gleam Are the pure drops of dewy even Which ne'er have left their native heaven. XXXII She raised her eyes to the wondering sprite, And they leapt with smiles, for well I ween Never before in the bowers of light Had the form of an earthly fay been seen. Long she looked in his tiny face; Long with his butterfly cloak she played; She smoothed his wing of azure lace, And handled the tassel of his blade; And as he told in accents low The story of his love and woe, She felt new pain in her bosom rise, And the tear-drop started in her eyes. And âOh! sweet spirit of earth,â she cried, âReturn no more to your woodland height, But ever here with me abide In the land of everlasting light! Within the fleecy drift we'll lie, We'll hang upon the rainbow's rim; And all the jewels of the sky Around thy brow shall brightly beam; And thou shalt bathe thee in the stream That rolls its whitening foam aboon, And ride upon the lightning's gleam, And dance upon the orbed moon! We'll sit within the Pleiad ring, We'll rest on Orion's starry belt, And I will bid my sylphs to sing The song that makes the dew-mist melt; Their harps are of the umber shade, That hides the blush of waking day, And every gleamy string is made Of silvery moonshine's lengthened ray; And thou shalt pillow on my breast, While heavenly breathings float around, And, with the sylphs of ether blest, Forget the joys of fairy ground.â XXXIII She was lovely and fair to see And the elfin's heart beat fitfully; But lovelier far and still more fair, The earthly form imprinted there, Nought he saw in the heavens above Was half so dear as his mortal love, For he thought upon her look so meek, And he thought of the light flush on her cheek; Never again might he bask or lie On that sweet cheek and moonlight eye; But in his dreams her form to see, To clasp her in his reverie, To think upon his virgin bride, Was worth all heaven and earth beside. XXXIV âLady,â he cried, âI have sworn to-night, On the word of a fairy knight, To do my sentence task aright; My honor scarce is free from stain, I may not soil its snows again; Betide me weal, betide me woe, Its mandate must be answered now.â Her bosom heaved with many a sigh, The tear was in her drooping eye, But she had led him to the palace gate, And called the sylphs who hovered there, And bade them fly and bring him straight Of clouds condensed a sable car. With charm and spell she blessed it there, From all the fiends of upper air; Then round him cast the shadowy shroud, And tied his steed behind the cloud, And pressed his hand as she bade him fly Far to the verge of the northern sky, For by its wane and wavering light There was a star that would fall to-night. XXXV Borne afar on the wings of the blast, Northward away, he speeds him fast, And the courser follows the cloudy wain, Till the hoof-strokes fall like pattering rain. The clouds roll backward as he flies, Each flickering star behind him lies, And he has reached the northern plain, And backed his fire-fly steed again, Ready to follow in its flight The streaming of the rocket light. XXXVI The star is yet in the vault of heaven, But it rocks in the summer gale; And now 'tis fitful and uneven, And now 'tis deadly pale; And now 'tis wrapped in sulphur smoke, And quenched is its rayless beam; And now with a rattling thunder-stroke, It bursts in flash and flame. As swift as the glance of the arrowy lance Which the storm-spirit flings from high, The star-shoot flew o'er the welkin blue, As it fell from the sheeted sky. As swift as the wind in its trail behind, The elfin gallops along; The fiends of the cloud are bellowing loud, But the sylphid charm is strong; He gallops unhurt in the shower of fire, While the cloud-fiends shrink from the blaze; He watches each flake till its sparks expire, And rides in the light of its rays. But he drove his steed to the lightning's speed, And he caught a glimmering spark; Then wheeled around to the haunted ground, And sped through the midnight dark. Ouphe and goblin! imp and sprite! Elf of eve! and starry fay! Ye that love the moon's light, Hitherâhither wing your way; Join ye in a jocund ring, Hand to hand, and wing to wing, Round the wild witch-hazel tree. Hail the wanderer again, With dance and song, and lute and lyre, Pure his wing and strong his chain, And doubly bright his fairy fire. Then twine ye in an eerie round, Brush the dew and print the lea; Skip and gambol, hop and bound, Round the wild witch-hazel tree. The beetle guards our holy ground, He flies about the haunted place, And if mortal there be found, He hums in his ears and flaps his face; The leaf-harp sounds our roundelay, The owlet's eyes our lanthornes be; Thus we revel, dance and play, Round the wild witch-hazel tree. But hark! from tower on tree-top high, The sentry elf his call has made, A streak is in the eastern sky, Shapes of moonlight flit and fade! The hillock gleams in morning spring, The skylark shakes his dappled wing, The day-glimpse glistens on the lawn, The cocks have crowed, the fays are gone. Note. The reader will find some of the inhabitants of the salt water a little farther up the Hudson than they usually travel, but not too far for the purposes of poetry. Song (AIR, âWHAT YE WHAâ) Oh! go to sleep, my baby dear, And I will hold thee on my knee; Thy mother's in her winding-sheet, And thou art all that's left to me. My hairs are white with grief and age, I've borne the weight of every ill, And I would lay me with my child, But thou art left to love me still. Should thy false father see thy face, The tears would fill his cruel e'e, But he has scorned thy mother's woe, And he shall never look on thee. But I will rear thee up alone, And with me thou shalt aye remain; For thou wilt have thy mother's smile, And I shall see my child again. Song (AIR, âTHE LEGACYâ) 'Tis not the beam of her bright blue eye, Nor the smile of her lip of rosy dye, Nor the dark brown wreaths of her glossy hair, Nor her changing cheek, so rich and rare. Oh! these are the sweets of a fairy dream, The changing hues of an April sky; They fade like dew in the morning beam, Or the passing zephry's odoured sigh. 'Tis a dearer spell that bids me kneel, 'Tis the heart to love, and the soul to feel; 'Tis the mind of light, and the spirit free, And the bosom that heaves alone for me. Oh! these are sweets that kindly stay From youth's gay morning to age's night; When beauty's rainbow tints decay, Love's torch still burns with a holy light. Soon will the bloom of the fairest fade, And love will droop in the cheerless shade, Or if tears should fall on his wing of joy, It will hasten the flight of the laughing boy. But oh! the light of the constant soul Nor time can darken nor sorrow dim; Though woe may weep in life's mingled bowl, Love still shall hover around its brim. To Miss Mc? WITH A WITHERED VIOLET Though fate upon this faded flower His withering hand has laid, Its odoured breath defies his power, Its sweets are undecayed. Oh! thus although thy warbled strains No longer wildly thrill, The memory of the song remains, Its soul is with me still. To ? (Fannie) Why these are the dreamings of fancy indeed! I prithee awake from the perilous trance; Or must I despair that I ever shall lead, My sweet little Fan from the fields of romance? 'Tis vain to expect the sun always to beam, Our passions, our feelings, are born to decay; The morning will break the most rapturous dream, And night throw her pall o'er the loveliest day. That day was deliciously sweet to be sure, Though it felt rather chilly and cold at its close; Alas! that it could not forever endure, As warm and as tender as when it arose. Yet perhaps it is best for us both after all; The sun of love's summer is sometimes too bright, And the flames of the noontide as withering fall, As the darkness and damp of the lustreless night. I know that the heart is worth nothing till won; It must melt and mature in the day-beam of bliss, As fruit when caressed by the amorous sun, Grows ruddy and ripe from the warmth of his kiss. Dim and dull is the diamond's spark, Till touched into life by its kindred gem; And the gentlest hearts are cold and dark, Till they mingle in sweet collision like them. But remember, dear, that the polishing sway, May wear the pure sparks of the diamond away; And the sun's warm kiss, all its blandishments o'er, Will taint the fair fruit it had ripened before. Miss H. R. Unveil her mind, but hide her face, And love will need no fuel; Alas! that such an ugly case Should hide so rich a jewel. Song (AIR, âPEGGY NA LEVENâ) Oh! the tear's in my eye, and my heart it is breaking, Thou hast fled from me, Connor, and left me forsaken; Bright and warm was our morning, but soon has it faded, For I gave thee a true heart, and thou hast betrayed it. Thy footsteps I followed in darkness and danger, From the home of my love to the land of the stranger; Thou wert mine through the tempest, the blight, and the burning, Could I think thou wouldst change when the morn was returning? Yet peace to thy heart, though from mine it must sever, May she love thee as I loved, alone and forever; I may weep for thy loss, but my faith is unshaken, And the heart thou hast widowed will bless thee in breaking. Meeting I shed no outward tears, but my heart wept, And it was softened in that gentle stream, Till sleep fell quietly, and while I slept There came upon my slumbers a sweet dream Of meeting friends; and if, as some men desire, Such shades have a deep meaning, there may be In the far future yet, some kindly beam, Some hours of homefelt bliss and holy ecstacy. For there were tears that fell like summer rain, To leave the orbs they dimmed more bright than ever; And happy sighs and sobs that leave no pain, And glad, wet smiles, like sundrops in a river. And there were fond embracings, and close press Of clasping hands, and talk of days long gone; And two sweet forms unknown, who came to bless My heart with a new name of love; and one Unseen, but felt, shared in each dear caress, And smiled in heaven to see her children's happiness. Lines WRITTEN ON LEAVING NEW ROCHELLE Whene'er thy wandering footstep bends Its pathway to the hermit tree, Among its cordial band of friends, Sweet Mary! wilt thou remember me? Though all too few the hours have rolled That saw the stranger linger here, In memory's volume let them hold One little spot to friendship dear. I oft have thought how sweet 'twould be To steal the bird of Eden's art, And leave behind a trace of me On every kind and friendly heart. And like the breeze in fragrance rolled, To gather as I wander by, From every soul of kindred mould, Some touch of cordial sympathy. 'Tis the best charm in life's dull dream, To feel that yet there linger here, Bright eyes that look with fond esteem, And feeling hearts that hold me dear. To Miss Mc? ON HEARING HER SING âCUSHLAMACHREEâ Yes! heaven protect thee, thou gem of the ocean; Dear land of my sires, though distant thy shore; Ere my heart cease to love thee, its latest emotion, The last dying throb of its pulse shall be o'er. And dark were the bosom, and cold, and unfeeling, Who tamely could listen unmoved at the call, When woman, the warm soul of melody stealing, Laments for her country and sighs o'er its fall. Sing, on, gentle warbler, the tear-drop appearing Shall fall for the woes of the queen of the sea; And the spirit that breathes in the harp of green Erin, Descending, shall hail thee her âCushlamachree.â The American Flag When Freedom from her mountain height Unfurled her standard to the air, She tore the azure robe of night And set the stars of glory there. She mingled with its gorgeous dyes The milky baldric of the skies, And striped its pure celestial white With streakings of the morning light. Then, from his mansion in the sun She called her eagle bearer down, And gave into his mighty hand The symbol of her chosen land. Majestic monarch of the cloud, Who rear'st aloft thy regal form, To hear the tempest-trumpings loud, And see the lightning-lances driven, When stride the warriors of the storm, And rolls the thunder-drum of heaven! Child of the sun! to thee 'tis given To guard the banner of the free, To hover in the sulphur smoke, To ward away the battle stroke, And bid its blendings shine afar, Like rainbows on the cloud of war, The harbingers of victory! Flag of the brave! thy folds shall fly, The sign of hope and triumph high, When speaks the signal trumpet-tone, And the long line comes gleaming on. Ere yet the life-blood, warm and wet, Has dimmed the glistening bayonet, Each soldier eye shall brightly turn To where thy sky-born glories burn, And, as his springing steps advance, Catch war and vengeance from the glance. And when the cannon-mouthings loud Heave in wild wreaths the battle-shroud, And gory sabres rise and fall Like shoots of flame on midnight's pall, Then shall thy meteor glances glow, And cowering foes shall sink beneath Each gallant arm that strikes below That lovely messenger of death. Flag of the sea! on ocean's wave Thy stars shall glitter o'er the brave; When death, careering on the gale Sweeps darkly around the bellied sail, And frighted waves rush wildly back Before the broadside's reeling rack, Each dying wanderer of the sea Shall look at once to heaven and thee, And smile to see thy splendors fly In triumph o'er his closing eye. Flag of the free heart's only home! By angel hands to valor given; Thy stars have lit the welkin dome, And all thy hues were born in heaven. Forever float that standard sheet! Where breathes the foe but falls before us, With Freedom's soil beneath our feet, And Freedom's banner streaming o'er us? Moi-mÃªme A comical mixture, half bad and half good, Who has skimmed over all things and nought understood; Too dull to be witty, too wild to be grave, Too poor to be honest, too proud for a knave; In short, a mere chaos, without form or rule, Who approaches to all things, but nearest a fool. Niagara Roar, raging torrent! and thou, mighty river! Pour your white foam on the valley below; Frown, ye dark mountains! and shadow forever The deep rocky bed where the wild rapids flow. The green sunny glade, and the smooth flowing fountain, Brighten the home of the coward and slave; The flood and the forest, the rock and the mountain, Rear on their bosoms the free and the brave. Nurselings of nature, I mark your bold bearing, Pride in each aspect and strength in each form; Hearts of warm impulse and souls of high daring, Born in the battle and reared in the storm. The red levin flash and the thunder's dread rattle, The rock-riven wave, and the war-trumpets breath, The din of the tempest, the yell of the battle, Nerve your steeled bosoms to danger and death. High on the brow of the Alps' snowy towers, The mountain Swiss measures his rock-breasted moors, O'er his lone cottage the avalanche lowers, Round its rude portal the spring torrent pours. Sweet is his sleep amid peril and danger, Warm is his greeting to kindred and friends; Open his hand to the poor and the stranger, Stern on his foeman his sabre descends. Lo! where the tempest the dark waters sunder Slumbers the sailor boy, reckless and brave, Warmed by the lightning, and lulled by the thunder, Fanned by the whirlwind and rocked by the wave; Wildly the winter wind howls round his pillow, Cold on his bosom the spray showers fall; Creaks the strained mast at the rush of the billow, Peaceful he slumbers, regardless of all. Mark how the cheek of the warrior flushes, As the battle-drum beats and the war torches glare, Like a blast of the north to the onset he rushes, And his wide-waving falchion gleams brightly in air. Around him the death-shot of foemen are flying, At his feet friends and comrades are yielding their breath; He strikes to the groans of the wounded and dying, But the war-cry he strikes with is âconquest or death!â Then pour thy broad wave like a flood from the heavens, Each son that thou rearest, in the battle's wild shock, When the death-speaking note of the trumpet is given, Will charge like thy torrent, or stand like thy rock. Let his roof be the cloud, and the rock be his pillow, Let him stride the rough mountain, or toss on the foam, He shall strike fast and well, on the field or the billow, In triumph and glory, for God and his home!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SECTION II ADDITIONAL POEMS IN THE 1835 EDITION To A Friend âYou damn me with faint praise.â [I] Yes, faint was my applause and cold my praise, Though soul was glowing in each polished line; But nobler subjects claim the poet's lays, A brighter glory waits a muse like thine. Let amorous fools in lovesick measure pine; Let Strangford whimper on, in fancied pain, And leave to Moore his rose leaves and his vine; Be thine the task a higher crown to gain, The envied wreath that decks the patriot's holy strain. II Yet not in proud triumphal song alone, Or martial ode, or sad sepulchral dirge, There needs no voice to make our glories known; There needs no voice the warrior's soul to urge To tread the bounds of nature's stormy verge; Columbia still shall win the battle's prize; But be it thine to bid her mind emerge To strike her harp, until its soul arise From the neglected shade, where low in dust it lies. III Are there no scenes to touch the poet's soul? No deeds of arms to wake the lordly strain? Shall Hudson's billows unregarded roll? Has Warren fought, has Montgomery died in vain? Shame! that while every mountain, stream, and plain Hath theme for truth's proud voice or fancy's wand, No native bard the patriot harp hath ta'en, But left to minstrel of a foreign strand To sing the beauteous scenes of nature's loveliest land. IV Oh! for a seat on Appalachia's brow, That I might scan the glorious prospect round, Wild waving woods, and rolling floods below, Smooth level glades and fields with grain embrown'd, High heaving hills with tufted forests crown'd, Rearing their tall tops to the heaven's blue dome, And emerald isles, like banners green unwound, Float o'er the lengthened lake, while round them roam Bright helms of billowy blue and plumes of dancing foam. V 'Tis true, no fairies haunt our verdant meads, No grinning imps deform our blazing hearth; Beneath the kelpie's fang no traveller bleeds, Nor gory vampire taints our holy earth, Nor spectres stalk to frighten harmless mirth, Nor tortured demon howls adown the gale; Fair reason checks these monsters in the birth; Yet have we lay of love and horrid tale Would dim the manliest eye and make the bravest pale. VI Where is the stony eye that hath not shed Compassion's heart-drops o'er the sweet McCrea? Through midnight wilds by savage bandits led, âHer heart is sadâher love is far away!â Elate that lover waits the promised day When he shall clasp his blooming bride again! Shine on, sweet visions! dreams of rapture, play! Soon the cold corse of her he loved in vain Shall blight his withered heart and fire his frenzied brain. VII Romantic Wyoming! should none be found Of all that rove thy Eden groves among, To wake a native harp's untutored sound, And give thy tale of woe the voice of song? Oh! if description's cold and nerveless tongue From stranger harps such hallowed strains could call, How doubly sweet the descant wild had rung, From one who, lingering o'er the ruined wall, Had plucked thy mourning flowers and wept thy timeless fall. VIII The Huron chief escaped from foeman nigh, His frail bark launched on Niagara's tides, âPride in his port, defiance in his eye,â Singing his song of death the warrior glides; In vain they yell along the river sides, In vain the arrow from its sheaf is torn, Calm to his doom the willing victim rides, And, till adown the roaring torrent borne, Mocks them with gesture proud, and laughs their rage to scorn. IX But if the charms of daisied hill and vale, And rolling flood, and towering rock sublime, If warrior deed or peasant's lowly tale Of love or woe should fail to wake the rhyme, If to the wildest heights of song you climb, (Though some who know you less, might cry, beware!) Onward! I sayâyour strains shall conquer time; Give your bright genius wing, and hope to share Imagination's worldsâthe ocean, earth, and air. X Arouse, my friend, let vivid fancy soar, Look with creative eye on nature's face, Bid airy sprites in wild Niagara roar, And view in every field a fairy race. Spur thy good Pacolet to speed apace, And spread a train of nymphs on every shore; Or if thy muse would woo a ruder grace, The Indian's evil manitous explore, And rear the wondrous tale of legendary lore. XI Away! to Susquehannah's utmost springs, Where, throned in mountain mist, Areouski reigns, Shrouding in lurid clouds his plumeless wings, And sternly sorrowing o'er his tribe's remains; His was the arm, like comet ere it wanes That tore the streamy lightnings from the skies, And smote the mammoth of the southern plains; Wild with dismay the Creek affrighted flies, While in triumphant pride Kanawa's eagles rise. XII Or westward far, where dark Miami wends, Seek that fair spot as yet to fame unknown; Where, when the vesper dew of heaven descends, Soft music breathes in many a melting tone, At times so sadly sweet it seems the moan Of some poor Ariel penanced in the rock; Anon a louder burstâa scream! a groan! And now amid the tempest's reeling shock, Gibber, and shriek, and wailâand fiend-like laugh and mock. XIII Or climb the Pallisado's lofty brows, Where dark Omana waged the war of hell, Till, waked to wrath, the mighty spirit rose And pent the demons in their prison cell; Full on their head the uprooted mountain fell, Enclosing all within its horrid womb Straight from the teeming earth the waters swell, And pillared rocks arise in cheerless gloom Around the drear abodeâtheir last eternal tomb! XIV Be these your hours of ease, but ne'er resign The soul of song to laud your lady's eyes; Go! kneel a worshipper at nature's shrine! For you her fields are green, and fair her skies! For you her rivers flow, her hills arise! And will you scorn them all, to pour forth tame And heartless lays of forced or fancied sighs? Still will you cloud the muse? nor blush for shame To cast away renown, and hide your face from fame? XV Come! shake these trammels offâlet fools rehearse Their loves and raptures in unmeaning chime; Cram close their rude conceits [in] mawkish verse, And torture hackneyed thoughts in timeless rhyme. But thou shalt soar in glorious flight sublime, With heavenly voice of music, strength, and fire, Waft wide the wonders of your native clime, With patriot pride and patriot heart inspire, Till wondering Europe hear Columbia's matchless lyre. Extracts from Leon, A Tale âBut oh, damned minutes tells he o'er, Who doats, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves.â OTHELLO, III, iii It is a summer evening, calm and fair, A warm, yet refreshing glow is in the air; Along its bank, the cool stream wanders slow, Like parting friends that linger as they go. The willows, as its waters meekly glide, Bend their dishevelled tresses to the tide, And seem to give it, with a moaning sigh, A farewell touch of tearful sympathy. Each dusky copse is clad in darkest green; A blackening mass, just edged with silver sheen From yon clear moon, who in her glassy face Seems to reflect the risings of the place. For on her still, pale orb, the eye may see Dim spots of shadowy brown, like distant tree Or far-off hillocks on a moonlight lea. The stars have lit in heaven their lamps of gold, The viewless dew falls lightly on the wold; The gentle air, that softly sweeps the leaves, A strain of faint, unearthly music weaves; As when the harp of heaven remotely plays, Or cygnets wailâor song of sorrowing fays That float amid the moonshine glimmerings pale, On wings of woven air in some enchanted vale. It is an eve that drops a heavenly balm, To lull the feelings to a sober calm, To bid wild passion's fiery flush depart, And smooth the troubled waters of the heart; To give a tranquil fixedness to grief, A cherished gloom, that wishes not relief. Torn is that heart, and bitter are its throes, That cannot feel on such a night, repose; As yet one heart there is that breathes this air, An eye that wanders o'er the prospect fair, That sees yon placid moon, and the pure sky Of mild, unclouded blue; and yet that eye Is thrown in restless vacancy around, Or cast in gloomy trance on the cold ground; And still, that breast with maddening passion burns, And hatred, love, and sorrow rule by turns. A lovely figure! and in happier hour, When pleasure laughed abroad from hall and bower, The general eye had deemed her smiling face The brightest jewel in the courtly place. So glossy is her hair's ensabled wreath, So glowing warm the eye that burns beneath, With so much graceful sweetness of address, And such a form of rounded tenderness; Ah! where is he on whom these beauties shine, But deems a spotless soul inhabits such a shrine? And yet a keen observer might espy Strange passions lurking in her deep black eye, And in the lines of her fine lip, a soul That in its every feeling spurned control. They passed unnotedâwho will stop to trace A sullying spot on beauty's sparkling face? And no one deemed, amid her glances sweet, Hers was a bosom of impetuous heat; A heart too wildly in its joys elate, Formed but to madly loveâor madly hate; A spirit of strong throbs, and steadfast will; To doat, detest, to die for, or to kill; Which, like the Arab chief, would fiercely dare To stab the heart she might no longer share; And yet so tender, if he loved again, Would die to save his breast one single pain. And he who cast his gaze upon her now, And read the traces written on her brow, Had scarce believed hers was that form of light That beamed like fabled wonder on the sight; Her raven hair hung down in loosened tress Before her wan cheek's pallid ghastliness; And, through its thick locks, showed the deadly white Like marble glimpses of a tomb, at night. In fixed and horrid musings now she stands, Her dark eyes bent to earth, and her cold hands Prest to her heart, now wildly thrown on high They wander o'er her browâand then a sigh Breaks deep and fullâand, more composedly She half exclaimsââNo! No!âit cannot be; He loves not, never lovedânot even when He pressed my wedded handâI knew it then; And yet, fool that I was, I saw he strove In vain to kindle pity into love. But Florence! she so loved, a sister too! My earliest, dearest playmateâone who grew Upon my very heartâto rend it so! His falsehood I could bearâbut hers! ah! no. She is not falseâI feel she loves me yet, And if my boding bosom could forget Its wild imaginings, with what sweet pain I'd clasp my Florence to my breast again.â With that came many a thought of days gone by, Remembered joys of mirthful infancy; And youth's gay frolic, and the short-lived flow Of showering tears, in childhood's fleeting woe, And life's maturer friendship, and the sense Of heart-warm, open, fearless confidence; All these came thronging with a tender call, And her own Florence mingled with them all. And softened feelings rose amid her pain, While from her eyes the clouds melted in gentle rain. A hectic pleasure flushed her faded face; It fledâand deeper paleness took its place; Then a cold shudder thrilled herâand, at last, Her lip a smile of bitter sarcasm cast, As if she scorned herself, that she could be A moment lulled by that sweet sophistry; For in that little minute memory's sting Gave word and look, sigh, gestureâeverything, To bid these dear delusive phantoms fly, And fix her fears in dreadful certainty. It traced the very progress of their love, From the first meeting in the locust grove; When from the chase Leon came bounding there, Backing his courser with a noble air; His brown cheek flushed with healthful exercise, And his warm spirits leaping in his eyes; It told how lovely looked her sister then, To long-lost friends, and home just come again; How on her cheek the tear of meeting lay, (That tear which only feeling hearts can pay;) While the quick pleasure glistened in her eye, Like clouds and sunshine in an April sky; And then it told, as their acquaintance grew, How close the unseen bonds of union drew Their souls together, and how pleased they were The same blythe pastimes and delights to share; How the same chord in each at once would strike Their taste, their wishes, and their joys alike. All this was innocent, but soon there came Blushes and starts of consciousness and shame; That, when she entered, upon either cheek The hasty blood in guilty red would speak Of something that should not be knownâand still Sighs half suppressed seemed struggling with the will. It told how oft at eve was Leon gone In moody wandering to the wood alone; And in the night, how many a broken dream Of bliss, or terror, seemed to shake his frame. How Florence too, in long abstracted fit Of soul-wrapt musing, for whole hours would sit; Nor even the power of music, friend, or book, Could chase her deep forgetfulness of look; And how, when questionedâwith an indrawn sigh, In vague and far-off phrase, she made reply, And smiled and struggled to be gay and free, And then relapsed in dreaming reverie. How when of Leon she was forced to speak, Unbidden crimson mantled in her cheek; And when he entered, how her eye would swim, And strive to look on everyone but him; Yet, by unconscious fascination led, In quick short glance each moment towards him fled. How he, too, seemed to shun her speech and gaze, And yet he always lingered where she was; Though nothing in his aspect or his air Told that he knew she was in presence there; But an appearance of constrained distress, And a dull tongue of moveless silentness, And a down-drooping eye of gloom and sadness, Oh! how unlike his former face of gladness. 'Tis plain! too plain! and I am lost, she cried; And in that thought her last good feeling died. That thought of hopeless horror seemed to dart A thousand stings at once into her heart; But a strong effort quelled it, and she gave The next to hatred, vengeance, and the grave. Her face was calmly stern, and but a glare Within her eyesâthere was no feature there That told what lashing fiends her inmates were; Withinâthere was no thought to bid her swerve From her intentâbut every strained nerve Was settled and bent up with terrible force, To some deep deed, far, far beyond remorse; No glimpse of mercy's light her purpose crost, Love, nature, pity in its depths were lost; Or lent an added fury to the ire That seared her soul with unconsuming fire; All that was dear in the wide earth was gone, She loved but two, and these she doted on With passionate ardorâand the close strong press Of woman's heart-cored, clinging tenderness; These links were torn, and now she stood alone, Bereft of all, her husband, sisterâgone! Ah! who can tell that ne'er has known such fate, What wild and dreadful strength it gives to hate? What had she left? revenge! revenge! was there; He crushed remorse and wrestled down despair; Held his red torch to memory's page, and threw A bloody stain on every line she drew; She felt dark pleasure with her frenzy blend, And hugged him to her heart, and called him friend. When sorrowing clouds the face of heaven deform, And hope's bright star sets darkly in the storm, Around us ghastly shapes and phantoms swim, And all beyond is formless, vague, and dim, Or life's cold barren path before us lies, A wild and weary waste of tears and sighs; From the lorn heart each sweetening solace gone, Abandoned, friendless, withered, and lone; And when with keener pangs we bleed to know That loved hands have struck the deepest blow; That friends we deemed most true, and held most dear, Have stretched the pall of death o'er pleasure's bier; Repaid our trusting faith with serpent guile, Cursed with a kiss, and stabbed beneath a smile; What then remains for souls of tender mould? One last and silent refuge, calm though coldâ A resting place for misery's gentle slave; Hearts break but once, no wrongs can reach the grave. But ye, mild spirits of afflicted worth! Sweet is your slumber in the quiet earth; And soon the voice of heaven shall bid you rise To meet rewarding smiles in yonder skies. But where, for solace, shall the bosom turn For death too strongâfor tearsâtoo proudly stern? When shall the lulling dews of peace descend On hearts that cannot break and will not bend? Ah! never, neverâthey are doomed to feel Pains that no balm from heaven or earth can heal; To live in groans, and yield their parting breath Without a joy in lifeâor hope in death. Yet, for a while, one living hope remains, That nerves each fibre and the soul sustains; One desperate hope, whose agonizing throes Are bitterer far than all the worst of woes; A hope of crime and horrors, wild and strange As demon thoughtsâthat hope is thine, revenge! 'Twas this that gave, oh! Ellinor, to thee A strength to bear thy matchless misery. Though the hot blood ran boiling in her brain, And rolled a tide of fire through every vein, Though many a rushing voice of blighted bliss Struck on her mental ears, like adders' hiss; That hope gave gloomy fierceness to her eye, Dashed down the tear, repressed the unloading sigh; Fixed her wan quivering lip, and steeled her breast To crush the hearts that robbed her own of rest. She wound her way within a heavy shade Of arching boughs, in broad-spread leaves arrayed; Which, clustering close and thick, shut out the light, And tinged with black the shadowy robe of night; Save here and there a melancholy spark Of flickering moonshine glimmered through the dark, Cheerless and dim, as when upon a pall, Through suffering tears, the looks of sorrow fall; But opening farther on, on either side A wider space the severing trees divide; And longer gleams upon the pathway meet, And the soft grass is wet beneath her feet. And now emerging from the darksome shade, She pressed the silken carpet of the glade. Beyond the green, within its western close, A little vine-hung, leafy arbor rose, Where the pale lustre of the moony flood Dimmed the vermillioned woodbine's scarlet bud; And glancing through the foliage fluttering round, In tiny circles gemmed the freckled ground. Beside the porch, beneath the friendly screen Of two tall trees, a mossy bank was seen; And all around, amid the silvery dew, The wild-wood pansy reared her petals blue; And gold cups and the meadow cowslip red, Upon the evening air their mingled odors shed. Unheeded all the grove's deep gloom had been, Unseen the moonlight brightness of the green; In vain the stream's blue burnish met her eye, Lovely its wave, but passed unnoticed by. The airs of heaven had breathed around her brow Their cooling sighsâshe felt them notâbut now That lonely bower appeared, and with a start Convulsive shudders thrilled her throbbing heart. For there, in days, alas! for ever gone, When love's young torch with beams of rapture shone, When she had felt her heart's impassioned swell, And almost deemed her Leon loved as well; There had she sat, beneath the evening skies, Felt his warm cheek and heard his murmured sighs; Hung on his breast, caressing and carest, Her husband smiled, and Ellinor was blest. And when his injured country's rights to shield, Blazed his red banner on the battlefield, There had she lingered in the shadows dim, And sat till morning watch, and thought of him; And wept to think that she might not be there, His toils, his dangers, and his wounds to share. And when the foe had bowed beneath his hand, And to his home he led his conquering band, There she first caught his long-expected face, And sprung to smile and weep in his embrace. These scenes of bliss across her memory fled, Like lights that haunt the chambers of the dead, She saw the bower, and read the image there Of joys that had been, and of woes that were; She clenched her hand in agony, and cast A glance of tears upon it as she past, A look of weeping sorrowâ'twas the last! She checked the gush of feeling, turned her face, And faster sped along her hurried pace. No longer now from Leon's lips were heard The sigh of bliss, the rapture-breathing word; No longer now upon his features dwelt The glance that sweetly thrills, the looks that melt; No speaking gaze of fond attachment told, But all was dull and gloomy, sad and cold. Yet he was kind, or labored to be kind, And strove to hide the workings of his mind; And cloaked his heart, to soothe his wife's distress Under a mask of tender gentleness. It was in vainâfor ah! how light and frail To love's keen eye is falsehood's gilded veil? Sweet winning words may for a time beguile, Professions lull, and oaths deceive a while; But soon the heart, in vague suspicion tost, Must feel a void unfilled, a something lost; Something scarce heeded, and unprized till gone, Felt while unseen, and, though unnoticed, known. A hidden witchery, a nameless charm, Too fine for actions and for words too warm; That passing all the worthless forms of art, Eludes the sense, and only woos the heart. A hallowed spell, by fond affection wove, The mute, but matchless eloquence of love! Oh! there were times when to my heart there came All that the soul can feel or fancy frame; The summer party in the open air, When sunny eyes and cordial hearts were there; When light came sparkling through the greenwood eaves Like mirthful eyes that laugh upon the leaves; Where every bush and tree in all the scene In wind-kissed wavings shake their wings of green, And all the objects round about dispense Reviving freshness to the awakened sense; The golden corslet of the humble-bee, The antic kid that frolics round the lea; Or purple lance-flies circling round the place, On their light shards of green, an airy race; Or squirrel glancing from the nut-wood shade An arch black eye, half pleased and half afraid; Or bird, quick-darting through the foliage dim, Or perched and twittering on the tendril slim; Or poised in ether sailing slowly on, With plumes that change and glisten in the sun Like rainbows fading into mistâand then, On the bright cloud renewed and changed again; Or soaring upward, while his full, sweet throat Pours clear and strong a pleasure-speaking note; And sings in nature's language wild and free, His song of praise for light and liberty. And when within, with poetry and song, Music and books led the glad hours along, Worlds of the visioned minstrel, fancy-wove, Tales of old time, of chivalry and love; Or converse calm, or wit-shafts sprinkled round, Like beams from gems too light and fine to wound; With spirits sparkling as the morning's sun, Light as the dancing wave he smiles upon, Like his own courseâalas! too soon to know Bright suns may set in storms, and gay hearts sink in woe. LeonâPart II âThe course of true love never did run smooth.â MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM, I, i I wish I had a little quiet spot, Some wild-wood dell and bower-enshaded grot, Where never glimpse of human face was seen, And none but fairy feet have trod the green, That with one trusting friend who loved me well, Unseen, unknown, I might forever dwell; And, far from woman's spell, sequestered move Beyond the doubts, the fears, the crimes, the woes of love. Poor son of sorrow, child of sighs and tears, Born in wild hopes, and nursed in wilder fears, Short are the joys that glad thy weeping eyes As rainbow tints that vanish while they rise, Glimpses of heaven that only serve to show The double deepness of succeeding woe. Oh, why, sweet cherub of celestial birth, In mercy sent to light and warm the earth, Why are thy purposed gifts forever lost, Crushed by cold prudence, or in passion tossed? Still the warm hearts that bend to thy control, Must bend in sorrow, or in frenzy roll, And reason only wakes to tell despair How blest they might have been, how curst they are. But why should dark foreboding dreams destroy The fleeting forms of momentary joy? Why damp the bliss with such presagings sad While eyes around are bright, and hearts are glad? For her, in every corner of the place, Dressed up in smiles is seen each happy face, Grandsire and crone, brisk youth and maiden gay, And children pranked in holiday array Around the castle stand, or sit, or trip, Joy in each eye and smiles on every lip; While talk and whisper buzzes far and wide, Of the brave bridegroom and the bonny bride. Some crowd the gates, some lie along the grass On the green road through which the train will pass; Some, more impatient to behold the band Around the chapel archway take their stand, Or, climbing to the windows, strive in vain To send their glances through the painted pane. The nearest bend their ears toward the lay, And strive to hear, although they cannot see; While some more daring, forward thrust their chin, And set the door acrack and peep within. Oh, 'tis an awful and glorious sight! The dim sun flings his stained light, The flame-tipped columns of the altar torch Strike a long gleam along the fretted porch, And lustres, with their branchy arms outspread, From pendant drops ten thousand sparkles shed; The velvet surface of the pulpit pall In gentle waves and crimson flashes fall, While the gay arches of the ceiling throw Broad massy shades and darkening streaks below. Then might you see, with nod, and smile, and stoop Of knights and dames, a gallant joyous group Filling the space and glancing here and there. A brilliant eye, or turning smooth and fair A neck of marble white, or with a bow Shaking the plume that quivers on the brow. Within the altar paling stands the choir, With mitred priest, the cowled and shaven friar, And novice boy, who, with a holy look Carries the pyx, or bears the sacred book, Or, as the words of reverent praise are spoke, Heaves to the Saviour-cross the curling incense smoke. But hark! from yonder sable-curtained dome In long low strains the female voices come, Swell, sink, subside, and as the murmur dies, Full, clear, and strong the solemn chantings rise, And gentle organ stops, with breathing sound, Like songs of distant angels, float around; And now they mingle, pause, and now alone Peals in deep majesty the lengthened tone; Slowly, as sinks the faint receding wail, The stolÃ¨d priest advances to the pale. Lines Written in An Album Grant me, I cried, some spell of art, To turn with all a lover's care, That spotless page, my Eva's heart, And write my burning wishes there. But Love, by faithless Lais taught, (How frail is woman's holiest vow!) Looked down, while grace-attempered thought Sat serious on his baby brow. Go, blot the album, cried the sage, There none but bards a place may claim; But woman's heart's a worthless page, Where every fool may write his name. Until by time and fate decayed, That line and leaf shall never part; Oh! who can tell how soon shall fade The line of love from woman's heart. Hope See through the clouds that roll in wrath, Yon little star benignant peep, To light along their trackless path The wanderers of the stormy deep. And thus, oh Hope! thy lovely form In sorrow's gloomy night shall be The star that looks through cloud and storm Upon a dark and moonless sea. When heaven is all serene and fair Full many a brighter gem we meet, 'Tis when the tempest hovers there Thy beam is most divinely sweet. The rainbow, when the sun declines, Like faithless friend will disappear; Thy light, dear star! more brightly shines When all is wail and sorrow here. And though Aurora's stealing gleam May wake a morning of delight, 'Tis only thy enchanting beam Will smile amid affliction's night. Fragment. Tuscara I Tuscara! thou art lovely now, Thy woods, that frowned in sullen strength Like plumage on a giant's brow, Have bowed their massy pride at length. The rustling maize is green around, The sheep is in the Congar's bed; And clear the ploughman's whistlings sound Where war-whoops pealed o'er mangled dead. Fair cots around thy breast are set, Like pearls upon a coronet; And in Aluga's vale below The gilded grain is moving slow Like yellow moonlight on the sea, Where waves are swelling peacefully; As beauty's breast, when quiet dreams Come tranquilly and gently by; When all she loves and hopes for seems To float in smiles before her eye. II And hast thou lost the grandeur rude That made me breathless, when at first Upon my infant sight you burst, The monarch of the solitude? No, there is yet thy turret rock, The watch-tower of the skies, the lair Of Indian gods, who, in the shock Of bursting thunders, slumbered there; And trim thy bosom is arrayed In labor's green and glittering vest, And yet thy forest locks of shade Shake stormy on that turret crest. Yet hast thou left the rocks, the floods, And nature is the loveliest then, When first amid her caves and woods She feels the busy tread of men; When every tree, and bush, and flower, Springs wildly in its native grace; Ere puny art has felt her power, And brightens only to deface. III Yes! thou art lovelier now than ever; How sweet 'twould be, when all the air In moonlight swims, along thy river To couch upon the grass, and hear Niagara's everlasting voice, Far in the deep blue west away; That dreaming and poetic noise We mark not in the glare of day; Oh! how unlike its torrent cry, When o'er the brink the tide is driven, As if the vast and sheeted sky In thunder fell from heaven. IV Were I but there, the daylight fled, With that smooth air, the stream, the sky, And lying on that minstrel bed Of nature's own embroidery, With those long tearful willows o'er me, That weeping fount, that solemn light, With scenes of sighing tales before me, And one green maiden grave in sight; How mournfully the strain would rise Of that true maid, whose fate can yet Draw rainy tears from stubborn eyes, From lids that ne'er before were wet. She lies not here, but that green grave Is sacred from the ploughâand flowers, Snow-drops, and valley lilies, wave Amid the grass, and other showers Than those of heaven have fallen there. For there's a fount of holiness E'en in stern hearts, that will not bear To openâbut in loneliness. V Then come in fancy's car with me, And we will sit beside the stream, And look upon the grave, and see The horrid deed again, and dream That every crimson colen-bell That lies beside a snowy blossom, Is a bright drop of blood that fell From her fair brows, or fairer bosom; The withered pine that stands alone, Shall be Mouina's stately form, And well her youthful fate is shown, A sapling blasted in the storm; And when the wind in sudden swell Howls round the peak of wild Maha, We'll think we hear the tiger yell, The screaming of the Iroquois; When bleeding, burning with a brand Snatched from his torturing pile he leapt, Right through his foe's bewildered band, Sprang in the swift canoeâand swept On mountain billows from the shore, With lifted arm and flashing eyes, Sing his death song to the roar Of cataract and winds, he flies Through volleyed arrows sent in shame, Onward towards the dizzy round, Waving his torture-brand of flame, In red and fiery triumph bound. To Lais When that eye of light shall in darkness fall, And thy bosom be shrouded in death's cold pall, When the bloom of that rich red lip shall fade, And thy head on its pillow of dust be laid, Oh! then thy spirit shall see how true Are the holy vows I have breathed to you; My form shall mould in thy grave beside, And in the blue heavens I'll seek my bride. Then we'll tell, as we tread yon azure sphere, Of the woes we have known while lingering here; And our spirits shall joy that, our pilgrimage o'er, We have met in the heavens to sever no more. Stanzas Day gradual fades, in evening gray, Its last faint beam hath fled, And sinks the sun's declining ray In ocean's wavy bed. So o'er the loves and joys of youth Thy wave, Indifference, roll; So mantles round our days of truth That death-pool of the soul. Spreads o'er the heavens the shadowy night Her dim and shapeless form, So human pleasures, frail and light, Are lost in passion's storm. So fades the sunshine of the breast, So passion's dreamings fall; So friendship's fervours sink to rest, Oblivion shrouds them all. To Eva A beam upon the myrtle fell From dewy evening's purest sky, 'Twas like the glance I loved so well, Dear Eva, from thy moonlight eye. I looked around the summer grove, On every tree its lustre shone; And all had felt that look of love The foolish myrtle deemed its own. Eva! behold thine image there, As fair, as false thy glances fall; But who the worthless smile would share That sheds its light alike on all? Bronx I sat me down upon a green bank-side, Skirting the edge of a gentle river, Whose waters seemed unwillingly to glide, Like parting friends who linger while they sever; Enforced to go, yet seeming still unready, Backward they wind their way in many a wistful eddy. Gray o'er my head the yellow-vested willow Ruffled its hoary top in the fresh breezes, Glancing in light, like spray on a green billow, Or the fine frost-work which young winter freezes When first his power in infant pastime trying, Congeals sad autumn's tears on the dead branches lying. From rocks around hung the rude ivy dangling, And in the clefts sumach of liveliest green, Bright ising-stars the little beach was spangling, The gold-cup sorrel from his gauzy screen Shone like a fairy crown, enchased and beaded, Left on some morn, when light flashed in their eyes unheeded. The hum-bird shook his sun-touched wings around, The blue-finch carolled in the still retreat; The antic squirrel capered on the ground Where lichens made a carpet for his feet. Through the transparent waves, the ruddy minkle Shot up in glimmering sparks his red fin's tiny twinkle. There were dark cedars with loose mossy tresses, White powdered dog-trees, and stiff hollies flaunting Gaudy as rustics in their May-day dresses, Blue pelloret from purple leaves upstarting A modest gaze, like eyes of a young maiden Shining beneath dropt lids the evening of her wedding. The breeze fresh springing from the lips of morn, Kissing the leaves, and sighing so to lose them, The winding of the merry locust's horn, The glad spring gushing from the rock's bare bosom: Sweet sights, sweet sounds, all sights, all sounds excelling, Oh! 'twas a ravishing spot formed for a poet's dwelling. And did I leave thy loveliness, to stand Again in the dull world of earthly blindness? Pained with the pressure of unfriendly hands, Sick of smooth looks, agued with icy kindness? Left I for this thy shades, where none intrude, To prison wandering thought and mar sweet solitude? Yet I will look upon thy face again, My own romantic Bronx, and it will be A face more pleasant than the face of men. Thy waves are old companions, I shall see A well-remembered face in each old tree, And hear a voice long loved in thy sweet minstrelsy. To Sarah I One happy year has fled, Sall, Since you were all my own, The leaves have felt the autumn blight, The wintry storm has blown. We heeded not the cold blast, Nor the winter's icy air; For we found our climate in the heart, And it was summer there. II The summer's sun is bright, Sall, The skies are pure in hue; But clouds will sometimes sadden them, And dim their lovely blue. And clouds may come to us, Sall, But sure they will not stay; For there's a spell in fond hearts To chase their gloom away. III In sickness and in sorrow Thine eyes were on me still, And there was comfort in each glance To charm the sense of ill. And were they absent now, Sall, I'd seek my bed of pain, And bless each pang that gave me back Those looks of love again. IV Oh, pleasant is the welcome kiss, When day's dull round is o'er, And sweet the music of the step That meets me at the door. Though worldly cares may visit us, I reck not when they fall, While I have thy kind lips, my Sall, To smile away them all.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SECTION III UNCOLLECTED AND UNPUBLISHED POEMS To Mrs. Abbe Allen ON HER REQUESTING A MONODY ON GEORGE CLINTON, FEBRUARY, 1812 Nay, lady, lady, do not ask My joyous harp to breathe the sigh, As yet it only knows to bask In sunny beams from beauty's eye; Should solemn dirge, or plaintive air, Be rung on chord so blithe as mine, Its notes would fly to bosoms fair, To blushing lips and rosy wine. As thus in careless mood I sung, Its merry strains so sweetly rung, Of playful glance, and witching smile, And melting kiss, and wanton wile, That, listening to the frolic lay, I heeded not the dying day. The setting sun was sinking low, And fading fast the vivid glow, That with such beauties decks the sky, As passion gives to woman's eye; One beam, that lingered in the west, Danced on the billow's dimpled breast, While eddies whirled in circling play, And glinted back the golden ray. It gave its line of emerald green A flowing tint of crimson sheen, And back reflected to the sky The Tyrian purple's darker dye. Now died that ray of western light In deepening shades of sable night; The starry dew was falling fast, And hoarsely moaned the evening blast, When, sad and slow I turned me back To seek the beaten village track, And soon I reached the holy ground Where sculptured stone and grassy mound Proclaimed the calm for those who weep In peaceful bed where all must sleep. The moon no longer sweetly smiled, And all was drear, and dark, and wild, Save, now and then, a little beam Between the passing clouds would stream, And for a moment gild the dark, Like meteor glow-worms' transient spark, Whose silver rays are lightly thrown On azure wave of mossy stone. And here and there a lonely star, Like taper twinkling from afar, Gleamed faintly on some marble tomb, And lit but did not cheer the gloom. A weeping-willow bending near, In solemn silence dropped the tear Upon the peasant's lowly bier, And on its bough, with dew-drops hung, The idle harp of joy I flung. Sudden in wistful murmur low, Grief's pensive notes began to flow; So mournful was the melody, So sad, and yet so rude and free, From sorrow's muse the numbers ran, They ne'er were breathed by mortal man. And slowly now the evening breeze Was sighing through the willow-trees, And lightly from the minstrel frame In fitful starts the death-song came. And now the note was sad and high, Now soft and low as lover's sigh, And now 'twas fierce as maniac's cry. Hushed for a moment was the wail, Then, borne upon the hollow gale, A rude yet plaintive prelude ran, And, wildly sad, the dirge began. Oh, cold is the grave where the warrior sleeps, And bitter the tears his country weeps. Gloomy and dark doth the cypress wave, And the chilly night-dew bespangles his grave. The hero has gone to his lowly bed, And patriots mourn for the mighty dead. Ah, well may the tear bedim the eye, And well may the bosom heave a sigh; And well the sable trophies wave O'er the hallowed tomb of the fallen brave; For the champion of freedom has gone to his bier, And the demons of woe are hovering near. For his was the arm on the battle-field The blood-stained sabre of death to wield; And his was the voice in council hall That hastened the haughty tyrant's fall. But hushed is that voice, so open and bold, And that valiant arm is stiffened and cold. The standard of freedom he flung to the gale, To float on the mountain and deck the vale; He plucked a bright pearl from the ocean king, And hung the gem on the eagle's wing. But the glittering jewel is torn from its place, And the banner is sullied with foul disgrace. The gem of her rights from my country is torn, And her banner is soiled, for wrongs are borne. But had Clinton upreared the vengeful brand, Had the reins been guided by Clinton's hand, His arm had restored the jewel again, And washed in their gore the deadly stain. And his name shall not be like the meteor ray, That gleams a moment and dies away; For the diamond tears of beauty shall fall On the blooming laurel that decks his pall. And the lordly swell of the minstrel's lays, Shall carry his name to distant days. Sunk the high strain in whispers low, And soon the note had ceased to flow; But still from echo's fairy tongue, In wandering notes a finale rung. Its flying numbers seemed to say âWhat though one star has passed away, Yet others beam with lustre bright, To cheer the gloom of danger's night.â The dirge was o'er; on hill and dell The morn's unclouded splendor fell; And, musing on the magic lay, I slowly winded back my way. The Spectre, A Fact The night was dark, the moon was hid, Her radiance dimmed by clouds o'erspread, No more resplendent shone; But now and then a transient beam, Like the faint shadow of a dream, Between the passing clouds would stream, To cheer the traveller lone. Now swiftly on Rodolpho rode, He saw the heaven in angry mood, And it was dead of night; Across his road a grave yard lay, Within whose bounds report did say, The spirits of the dead did play, Around the tombstones white. No superstitious fears opprest And filled with dread Rodolpho's breast, And onward now he sped; Until the sullen, gloomy light Just faintly showed the tombstones white, The curst abode of many a sprite, The mansions of the dead. He saw a sight that made him start, 'Twould have appalled the stoutest heart, That e'er in battle stood. A spectre form of giant height Appeared to his astonished sight, Its flowing robe was snowy white, Stained with large drops of blood. Rodolpho breathed a silent prayer, The spectre vanished into air, But in its place there stood With threatening mien and furious eye, As if impatient of its prey, And watching as the steed passed by, A monster of the wood! The traveller paused, the monster stops, Again the pauseâcold clammy drops Hung on Rodolpho's brow. The moon at length her radiance threw And gave to his astonished view (Now Reader, mark, I tell thee true) A d?d old spotted cow! J R D The Mocking-Bird Early on a pleasant day, In the poet's month of May, Field and forest looked so fair, So refreshing was the air, That, despite the morning dew, Forth I walked, where, tangling grew Many a thorn and briery bush, Where the red-breast and the thrush, Gaily raised their early lay, Thankful for returning day. Every thicket, bush and tree, Swelled the grateful harmony; As it wildly swept along, Echo seemed to catch the song, But the plain was wide and clear, Echo never whispered there. From a neighb'ring mocking-bird, Came the answering note I heard. Low and soft the song began; Scarce I caught it, as it ran Through the melancholy trill Of the pensive whippoorwill. Twittering sparrow, cat-bird's cry, Red-bird's whistle, robin's sigh, Black-bird, blue-bird, swallow, lark, Each his native note must mark. Oft he tried the lesson o'er, Each time louder than before; Burst at length the finished song, Loud and clear it poured along. All the choir in silence heard, Hushed before the wondrous bird. All transported and amazed, Scarcely breathing, long I gazed. Now it reached the loudest swell; Lower, lower, now it fell; Lower, lower, lower still, Scarce it sounded o'er the rill. Now the warbler ceased to sing, Now he spread his downy wing; And I saw him take his flight, Other regions to delight. Then, in most poetic wise, I began to moralize. In this bird can fancy trace An emblem of the rhyming race; Ere with heaven's immortal fire, Loud they strike the quivering wire; Ere in high, majestic song, Thundering wars the verse along; Soft and low each note they sing, Soft they tune each varied string; Till each power is tried and known, Then the kindling spark is blown. Thus perchance has Maro sung; Thus his harp has Milton strung; Thus immortal Avon's child; Thus, O Scott, thy witch-notes wild; Thus has Pope's melodious lyre, Beamed with Homer's martial fire; Thus did Campbell's war-blast roar Round the cliffs of Elsinore; Thus he dug the soldier's grave, Iser, by thy purpled wave. C. F. The Past and the Present From boding dreams where visioned woes arise, Ah, where shall terror turn her waking eyes, Where fly, when fancy leads her phantom train? Blight the cold heart, and fire the phrenzied brain, When slumber steeps her wand in misery's bowl, And pours the venom on the wounded soul. Deep wrapt in spectered gloom remembrance rears The lonely image of departed years. With anguished gaze my aching eyes contrast What was and is the present and the past. The waste wild path, where lone unblest I roam, With all the calm delights of happy home; Home! sacred name, at thy endearing sound What forms of vanished pleasures hover round! What long-lost blisses, mourned, alas, in vain! Awakened memory gives my soul again! Joys, now no more, yet sweeter, dearer still Than all that wait me in this world of ill. Friends severed long, and of that much-loved one, Who still from heaven looks kindly on her son. Thou gnawing canker in misfortune's breast, Is this thy beam that soothes a wretch to rest? No, 'tis the light that glimmers on a tomb, To add a deeper horror to the gloom. Sad is the homeless heart; and mine hath known Neglect's cold blasts, unpitied and alone; I meet no eye that, softening, rests on mine, No hand whose heart-warm pressure says, 'tis thine! No lip whose smile a ready welcome bears, No heart to share my joys or soothe my cares. Yet through the clouds that round me roll, A brighter sunbeam lights my darkened soul. Again around the social hearth of home, My all of earth, friends, parent, sisters come, With hearts unchanged by time or fortune's war; We meet in peace to part on earth no more. Again we feel affection's holy kiss, And taste the dear domestic heaven of bliss. Thus when remembrance throws her sombre dyes, Hope bids her fairy bow of promise rise; With magic ideal peace bestows, And lulls with future joys our present woes. What boots it that when nature stamps the seal, She gave the heart to love, the soul to feel! No dew-eyed seraph meets me on the way, To wake its kindling pulses into play. E'en the bright dream my fancy half believed, Has left my heart to mourn o'er hope deceived; To pine for life's last solace torn away, And curse the smile that flattered to betray. What boots it now, that toil and vigil past On science's steep ascent I stand at last? Lo! where around my heart won honors wait, Dark envy, malice, pale and smiling hate, And the fair tree which might have flourished high, And cast its leafy glories to the sky, Sinks by the canker's deadly touch o'erthrown, And dies deserted, withered, and alone. What boots it now that o'er my infant head, Some blessed drops from fancy's cup were shed, That bade my heart with nameless rapture swell Before the master of the mighty spell, Gave my dim eyes thy thousand charms to see, And bowed my soul, oh matchless muse, to thee? Cast round thy eye, and mark where'er it darts, A mass of empty minds and icy hearts; Vain were the hope one mental joy to steal, From clods that will not think and cannot feel; Vain were the hope communion sweet to find, The flow of thought, the interchange of mind When fairy dreams and minstrel visions high, Burn in the cheek, and brighten in the eye; When hidden truth, by keen-eyed reason sought, Draws on the brow the deepening lines of thought; When wit awakes the glance of keen delight, And humor holds his sides and laughs outright. Yet these were once my own, and more divine, Home, parents, sisters, friends, all, all were mine. A home where love in every heart was shrined, Warmed by the heart, illumined by the mind. Oh, then I thought in sweet seclusion blest, No fears to haunt us, and no cares molest; Calm as the slumbering wave our life should glide Serene and still, a mild, unruffled tide That steals unmarked along in viewless wave, Towards the peaceful ocean of the grave. Oh! there were times when to my heart there came All that my soul can feel or fancy frame; The summer party in the open air, When sunny eyes and cordial hearts were there; When light came sparkling through the greenwood eaves Like mirthful eyes that laugh upon the leaves; Where every bush and tree in all the scene In wind-kissed wavings shake their leaves of green, And all the objects round about dispense Reviving perfumes to the awakened sense; The golden corslet of the humble-bee, The antic kid that frolics round the lea; Or purple lance-flies circling round the place, On thin, light shards of green, an airy race; Or squirrel glancing from the nut-wood shade An arch black eye, half pleased and half afraid; Or bird, quick-darting from the foliage dim, Or perched and twittering on the tendril slim; Or poised in ether sailing slowly on, With plumes that change and glitter in the sun Like rainbows fading into mistâand then, On the bright cloud renewed and changed again; Or soaring upward, while his full, sweet throat Pours clear and strong a pleasure-speaking note; And sings in nature's language wild and free, His song of praise for light and liberty. And when within, with poetry and song, Music and books led the glad hours along, Worlds of the visioned minstrel, fancy wove Tales of old time, of chivalry and love; Or converse calm, or wit-shafts sprinkled round, Like beams from gems too light and fine to wound; With spirits sparkling as the morning's sun, Light as the dancing wave he smiles upon, Like his own courseâalas! too soon to know Bright suns may set in storms, and gay hearts sink in woe. Look round thee, wretch, are there no joys to taste On all the barren world's abounding waste, Can hope, sweet solacer, no balm supply From the rich stores of dark futurity? She, when cold sorrow throws her sombre dyes, Bids through the gloom her bow of promise rise, In magic dreams ideal peace bestows, And lulls with future joys our present woes; Warms with her smiles, when bleak misfortune lowers And strews life's weary way with thornless flowers. Enchantress, no! though bright its gleamings be, Thy heavenly lamp hath now no light for me; Condemned like unforgiven ghost to tread The scenes of buried joys and pleasures fled, Through all my haunts of joyous youth to roam, Friendless and sad, a wretch without a home. One only gift remainsâone boon I crave, A home of dreamless restâa quiet grave. To ? [Rosa] One lingering kiss, and then good-night, For see, my love, yon envious beam Must end our vigil of delight, And break its warm empassioned dream. But, Rosa dear, these kisses keep Till day its downward course has ta'en, And I will steal while others sleep, To sip their rosy sweets again. For senseless ice-embosomed souls May seek the sun's intrusive glare, But oh, the heart that love controls, Will never breathe its worship there. And we have bathed in bliss too dear, To meet the telltale eyes of light; The day-spring must not find me here; Once more, and now, my love, good-night. To Mary Dear Mary, pray how can I prattle Of the charms of that eloquent eye, When its beams, though they offer me battle, Remain so provokingly shy? Oh! let but their languishing fire, With mine all voluptuously meet, And the spirit that breathes in my lyre, Shall pour out its soul at your feet. And how can I picture the pleasures, That hang on those rubies divine, While you, covetous, hoard up their treasures, Nor e'er let them linger on mine? From enjoyment's full bowl I must sip, love, Emotion too warm to express, For cold is the passionless lip, love, That meets with no mutual caress. Yon harp of the heavens still slumbers, Till kissed by the breeze from above, And the impulse that wakens my numbers, Must come from the lips that I love. Fragments The youth impatient chides the creeping hours, And prays old Sol to speed his tardy pace, And bid the western star arise to light His heart's devotion to its holy shrine; At length the course is run, and lo! The star that âlovers loveâ shines in the golden west. With kindling eye he hails its dawning beam, And deems it brighter than the fairest sun; His cheek blooms ruddier, while his quickened pulse Trembles with joy's anticipated thrill, And fancy revels in expected bliss. ... but when mild friendship adds Her purer light to his unsteady flame, It warms and brightens to a summer sun. Oh! then 'tis rapture allâand nameless joy As blest, as brilliant, and as richly fair As that which fancy gives the poet's god, When on his visioned eye, in dreams arise A sweeter, dearer heaven than his own. 'Tis the heart's paradise where pleasure reigns In perfumed bowers of ravishing delight; The air is balm, we breathe in sighs of bliss, Each eye expressive beams enchantment forth; Each murmured word in melting music falls, And all around is luxury and love. Oh love, without thee what were mortal life, A dreary scene where horrid shadows hang In fixed forbidding gloom; but thou canst change The darkening clouds to clear blue summer skies, And gild the murkiest night of human woe With the mild lustre of a peaceful moon; Still wave thy wing of joy above my head, Sweet solacerâand when my hour is near, Grant in thy rapturous worship I may sink And soar to Heaven on the wings of love! Abelard to Eloise Weep on, weep on, we wail the deadâ Now by those humid lids I swear, For every tear of woe they shed, My heart shall bleed a drop as dear. Oh! torture's last convulsive sigh! Oh! all the pangs that wring the brow When souls of guilt despairing die, Were heaven to what I suffer now. Nay! look not thusâwert thou but blest, Erect and calm my soul could bear To prison in this aching breast The writhings of its own despair. The flame that bears my burning brain Should never force one stifled groan, So I might take thy load of pain And bear its weary weight alone. Yet when on calm and sullen gloom, Oblivion's waveless stream shall roll, A sun shall beam beyond the tomb To light the hope-abandoned soul. Soon may that orb of peace arise, That we may seek a purer sphere, And take that bliss in yonder skies By man and fate denied us here. [Poetic Epistle to Fitz-Greene Halleck, May 1, 1818] Dumfries, May 1, 1818. Well, Fitz, I'm here, the mair's the pity, I'll wad ye curse the vera city From which I write a braid Scots ditty, Afore I learn it; But if ye canna mak it suit ye, Ye ken ye'll burn it. My grunzie's gat a twist intill it, Thae damned Scots airts sae stuff and fill it, I doubt wi' a' my doctor's skill it 'll keep the gaitâ Not e'en my pen can scratch a billet And write it straight. Ye're aiblins thinking to forgather Wi' a hale sheet of muir and heather, O' burns and braes and sic like blether To you a feastâ But stop, ye will not light on either This time at least. Now stir your bries a wee and ferlie, Then drop your lip and glower surly; Troth if you do, I'll tell ye fairly Ye'll no' be rightâ We've made our jaunt a bit too early For sic a sight. What it may be when summer cleeds Muir, shaw, and brae wi' bonnie weeds, Sprinkling the gowan on the meads And browsy knowes, I dinna kenâbut now the meads Scarce keep the cows. For trees poor Scotia's sadly scanted; A few bit pines and larches planted, And thae wee, knurlie, blastit, stunted As e'er thou sawest; Row but a sma' turf fence anent it, Heck! there's a forest. For streams ye'll find a puny puddle, That would'na float a skulebairn's coble; A cripple still might near hand-hobble Dry bauchled over; Some whinstone crags to make it bubble, And there's a river! And then their cauld and reekie skies, They look ower dull to Yankee eyes; The sun ye'd ken na of his rise A'maist the day, Just a noonblink that hardly dries The dewy brae. Yet leese auld Scotland on her women, Ilk sonzie lass and noble yeoman, For luver's heart or blade of foeman O'er baith victorious; E'en common sense, that plant uncommon, Grows bright and glorious. Fecks! but my pen has skelp'd along, I've whistled out an unco' song 'Bout folk I ha' na been amang Twa days as yet; But faith, the farther that I gang, The mair ye'll get. Sae sharpen up your lugs, for soon I'll tread the hazelly braes o' Doon, See Mungo's well, and set my shoon Where i' the dark Bauld Tammie keek'd the drunken loon At cutty sark. And I shall tread the hallowed bourne Where Wallace blew his bugle-horn O'er Edward's banner, stained and torn. What Yankee bluid But feels its free pulse leap and burn Where Wallace stood! But pouk my penâI find I'm droppin' My braw Scots style to English loppin'; I fear a'maist that ye'll be hoppin' I'd quit it quite; If so, I e'en must think of stoppin', And sae gude-night. [Poetic Epistle to Fitz-Greene Halleck, May 10, 1818] Irvine, 10th May, 1818, 10 p.m. My muse is almost fagged with writing, From twelve at noon I've been inditing; Further, four sheets of jack-screw packing, So close, they look like daubs of blacking; Two letters in a rhyming strain To dearest sisters o'er the main; You're at the fag-end of the feast, But Willy has itââlast not least.â I wrote you late a queer hotch-potch Of English clipped and broken Scotch But luckily I chanced to pass While reading it, before the glass, And saw my grunzie on the gape, In such a damned ungainly shape, So twirled and twisted, full and hollow, In such a storm of sweat and swallow, I stopped, betwixt a laugh and curse; I swore, e'en though my rhymes were worse, I'd have some pity on your mouth, And clink the language of the South, In all the future lines I send ye, Which (patience to ye) will be plenty. But, Fitz, I'll not be saying either, I'll drop the Lowland altogether, Only not haul it by the lugs, As honest Swankie did his hogs, When he advanced them from the byre To grunt hog-Latin with the friar. From Ribbleside to Irvine town Each step has been on poets' groun'; Think how my rhyming soul was swelling Within eyeshot of gray Helvelyn! To mark from Skiddaw's mighty lap The land of porringers and of pap, With lakes that glittered bright between, Like duckponds from a dunghill seen; The varied beauties of the way, Coal-works, gibbets, stacks of hay, Canals and railways, freestone bridges, Right-angled gardens, and clipped hedges; And then to meet, how vastly pleasant, A full-fed brute in every peasant! And here, although across the border, The men are of a different order; The fient a sight your eyeball crosses But whinstone hills and dark peat-mosses, Braw bare-legged girls, auld smoky queans, And filthy huts, and filthier weans. But stop, Sir Poet, if you please, We're o'er the Nith and past Dumfries, And here, God bless the spot forever, There's something like a Yankee river! Though small and weak, its light waves swell; My bonny Bronx, 'tis like yoursell, And that's eno' to make me pour A hearty blessing on your shore. And now the misty sun's revealing Scenes that would rouse a Dutchman's feeling. Where'er the eye enraptured turns, Some relique of her minstrel Burns Shines on old Scotia's barren land, Like the green spots on Afric's sand. The bush that heard his first love-vow, The field where last he held the plough, The hill whose kindling sides along First pealed the Bruce's battle-song; The low thatch-roof where Coila stood, The bowl that fired the poet's blood, To sing how wi' his parting breath A Scotchman gi'es the grip to death! The burnie banks he oft has trod, And now, alas! the silent sod Where sleeps in his untimely cell The master of the mighty spell. Ah, Rob! my friend, for so you've been aye, Save Shakespeare's self, the best of any, Blithe wad I been if ye had known To let strong drink and priests alone, Or only used in moderation These two grand curses of creation; Then had ye shone the first in glory, Not Campbell's self a foot before ye, Nor died, like Basil's holy pigeon, Martyr to whiskey and religion. Westward away we take the air, Just stop at Irvine's holy fair, And then for Ayr's twa clavering brigs, And green Tarbolton's barley rigs; We passed poor Mailie's dike, the banks Where honest Luath eased his shanks, And wi' his stroanin' crony sat An hour in philosophic chat; We took our whiskey in the cot Where ranter Rob was born and got; Saw the old thorn, the stump of 't rather, That stopped the gab of Mungo's mither, And in the kirk's bedevilled tower Stood in the rain a good half hour. We found where Nannie in her dances Exposed her legs to Satan's glances, Until his wintling clumsy bones, In amourous fidgets ground the stones. We passed the brig (of brigs the wale), Where Maggie warsled for her tail, And coming back, the last of any, Saw the wee house of Souter Johnny. For Wallace, Fitz, I've had a damper; My wits were on the up-hill scamper To see where Scotland's genius rose In triumph o'er her prostrate foes; But Ayr's dull brutes, to scrape a farthing, Have turned the proud Barns to a garden. (Blasted be every blade that springs, Unless the angry nettle flings Her armed and bristly branches there, To guard the hallowed Barns of Ayr.) The tower is there, the clock, the spire, Whence fifty feet perhaps, or higher, Hurled by the English imps of hell, From off the top the hero fell, And almost broke his gallant bones Against the damned hard-hearted stones; And there's the stone, a wee Scotch pebble (Ten men to lift it were unable) Which Wallace skelpit o'er the house As easy as you would a mouse. Such sweating tales we have in plenty, But what I've written will content ye; To-morrow, or the next day comin', Our party's off toward Loch Lomond, And thence, o'er water, hill, and isle, To Erne, Katrine, and Aberfoyle. The sky is heavy, dull, o'ercast, And, faith, I'm fearin' it will last; And if it should, ye may divine We'll find the Highlands unco' fine. Gads me! my hat, by all that's cheerly, The moon is up and shining clearly! Hey! for an harlequinian antic, I've been a month across th' Atlantic, And this the first good glimpse mine eye Has gotten of a Yankee sky; And there's the star! ye west winds fan her! That shines upon my country's banner. She loves the Westâshe seldom flings Her sparkle points on eyeless kings, But keeps them for the gallant lads Who wear her in their black cockades. Here, where mist, cloud, and smoke unite To stifle up each heavenly light, Long may we watch each wind that blows Before that glittering eye unclose. Thus, to my country's sore dishonor, Old England's fog lay long upon her, Till roused at last, each spirit proud, Her cannon-thunders burst the cloud, And poured o'er Europe's hills afar The glories of the Western star! Lord! but she's gone! and here again Our old acquaintance, mist and rain. Ye vapourous jades! the red plague rid ye, If ye'd not come until I bid ye, Ye'd still be wearing, I've a notion, Your white foam night-caps o'er the ocean; And I'd have time mine eyes to feast On my bright star an hour at least. Yet, Hesper! though ye now must darkle, Lord bless you for that pleasant sparkle. I think ye must have known this even A Yankee eye was turned toward heaven, And shoved the surly clouds askance, To give him just a friendly glance, Mind him of home, help on his letter, And make him sleep to-night the better. Ah! Fitz, my lad, I'm thinking, aye, How blithe and happy'll be the day When we shall meet again together I' the land of freedom and fine weather; How we shall talk of all that's past Since you and me forgathered last; And, fecks! ye'll crack a dainty kernel When ye get hold of Wully's journal. I'd thought by this to send a sample, But my scrimp paper's hardly ample Eno' to hold another line, Except, âYours mostâ or âEver thine.â To Lais Nay, think not, dear Lais, I feel a regret That another awakened thy sigh, Or repine that some traces remain of it yet, In the beam of that eloquent eye. Though the light of its smile on a rival had shone, Ere it taught me the way to adore, Shall I scorn the bright gem, now I know it my own, Because it was polished before? And though oft the rich sweets of that lip hath been won, It but fits it the better for bliss, As fruit, when caressed by the bright glowing sun, Grows ripe from the warmth of its kiss. As the artist enkindles the diamond's blaze, As the grape blushes ripe in the summer sun's rays, So joy from our soul, will each blemish remove, And our heart be matured in the sunshine of love. But remember, dear girl, that the polisher's sway, May wear the pure spark of the diamond away, And the sun's burning kiss, all its blandishments o'er, Will taint the fair fruit it has ripened before. To ? Yes! I swore to be true, I allow, And I meant itâbut, somehow or other, The seal of that amorous vow Was pressed on the lips of another. Yet I did but as all would have done; For, where is the being, dear cousin, Content with the beauties of one When he might have the range of a dozen? Young Love is a changeable boy, And the gem of the sea rock is like him; For he gives back the beams of his joy To each sunny eye that may strike him. From the kiss of a zephyr and rose, Love sprung in an exquisite hour; And fleeting and sweet, heaven knows, Is this child of a sigh and a flower. To A Lady WHO DECLARED THAT THE SUN PREVENTED HER FROM SLEEPING Why blame old Sol, who, all on fire, Prints on your lips the burning kiss; Why should he not your charms admire, And dip his beam each morn in bliss? Were't mine to guide o'er paths of light The beam-haired coursers of the sky, I'd stay their course the livelong night To gaze upon thy sleeping eye. Then let the dotard fondly spring, Each rising day, to snatch the prize; 'Twill add new vigor to his wing, And speed his journey through the skies. Lines Addressed to the Defenders of New Orleans THE DAY BEFORE THE BATTLE OF THE 8TH OF JANUARY, 1815 Hail! sons of generous valor! Who now embattled stand, To wield the brand of strife and blood, For freedom and the land. And hail to him, your laurelled chief, Around whose trophied name, A nation's gratitude has twined The wreath of deathless fame. Now round the gallant leader Your iron phalanx form, And throw, like ocean's barrier rocks, Your bosoms to the storm. Though wild as ocean's wave it rolls, Its fury shall be low, For Justice guides the warrior's steel, And Vengeance strikes the blow. High o'er the gleaming columns The bannered star appears, And proud amid the martial band, His crest the eagle rears; And long as patriot valor's arm Shall win the battle's prize, That star shall beam triumphantly, That eagle seek the skies. Then on, ye daring spirits, To danger's tumults now; The bowl is filled, and wreathed the crown To grace the victor's brow. And they who for their country die, Shall fill an honored grave, For glory lights the soldier's tomb, And beauty weeps the brave. To the Heroes of Niagara Oh, hail to the heroes, whose deeds have restored Our honor unsullied once more! And the blaze of their valor triumphantly poured On the field that was darkened before; For hid from our sight was fair Victory's form, And the heavens were clouded in wrath, Till the sons of the battle, like stars of the storm, Arose on the desolate path. Then plume thy dark pinion, proud bird of the North, And sweep from thy home in the skies, On the wings of the whirlwind, exultingly forth To the plain where thy enemy dies. And joy, O my country! thy stains are effaced, The pride of the boaster is low; And thy deep-sullied standard by cowards disgraced, Is washed in the gore of the foe. And thou, starry banner! look proudly again On the chiefs who redeemed thee from shame, Nor darken thy beam, though it fall on the slain Who repose on the death-bed of fame; For the lustre that circles the tombs of the brave, Its splendor unfailing maintains; The sun of their being may set in the grave, The light of their glory remains. Yes, weep for the brave who in battle have died, Their fall was triumphantly bright; In our sorrows shall mingle a feeling of pride, Like the moon through the tears of the night. They are gone, but the fame of their glorious deeds, Shall live in our memory yet; And the tear-bedewed beaming of moonlight succeeds To the blaze of the sun that has set. [The Kiss] I chased from the dew-moistened breast of a rose A fly that attempted its nectar to sip, And I thought, as I gazed on its delicate glows, That the bloom of its leaf was the blush of thy lip. In a moment of fancy I gave to its breast A kiss like the one I bestowed upon thee, And I felt, as my lip to its bosom was prest, That the fly and the snail had enjoyed it like me. To My Sister Caroline I've meant it, believe me, many a time, Dear Sis, to take the poet's quill, And waft upon the wings of rhyme A line to say I love thee still. But habit, that compelling king, Stern tyrant of the wills of men, Had frozen each poetic spring And struck a palsy in my pen. My lips were mute; but think not; Sis, That time could blot a trace, a tone Of her who was my light, my bliss When all but hope and her were gone. Oh! true hearts feel in absence's night, Affection's pulse more freely play, Like flowers that, though they love the light, Bloom brightest when the sun's away. In days when misery and pain Had chained me in their icy band, It was my sweetest pastime then To wander in the dreamy land, To mount the rainbow-curtained car By Fancy to her children given, And in the twinkling of a star Shut out dull earth, and welcome Heaven. Well may you guess my resting-place, My land of bliss, my fairy ground; Well may a sister's fancy trace The hearts, the forms that girt me round. And in that ideal land I dwelt So long that I had gained the art To wander at my will, and melt The ice that gathered round my heart In the kind looks that blessed me there; For they had power to drown the past, And point to prospects bright and fair, To bless the longing heart at last. And sometimes when an earthly pain Would wake me from my dream of bliss, I'd call my pleasures back again In some such idle rhyme as this. To My Sister Carry The sun has abandoned his home in the heaven, But still from his billowy urn, To yon moon a few beams of his lustre are given, To cheer us till morn shall return. So Sis, when we sever in darkness and sorrow, May hope, like the heavenly ray, A beam from the light of futurity borrow, To lighten the gloom of to-day. Sonnet Is thy heart weary of unfeeling men, And chilled with the world's ice? Then come with me, And I will bring thee to a pleasant glen Lovely and lonely. There we'll sit, unviewed By scoffing eye; and let our hearts beat free With their own mutual throb; for wild and rude The access is, and none will there intrude To poison our free thoughts and mar our solitude. Such scenes move not their feelingsâfor they hold No fellowship with nature's loneliness. The frozen wave reflects not back the gold And crimson flushes of the sunset hour; The rock lies cold in sunshineânot the power Of heaven's bright orb can clothe its barrenness. Song at Sea Sleep, lady, sleep, the planets weep Their star-dew on the midnight deep; The moonlight beam, shines on the stream, To light the water-spirits dream; Oh, softly thus shall slumber shed Her lulling dews around thy head; And fancy's beamings sparkle nigh, As brightly as on thy dreaming eye. On favoring tides, the vessel glides, The sea-fire sparkles round her sides, And in the sail the evening gale Is whispering low a soothing tale. Yet, lady, sleep, in visions sweet A dream scene thy gaze shall meet, And while the tall ship slowly moves, Thy heart shall fly to friends it loves. But hark! the cry from topmast high Its accents tell that land is nigh, And dimly seen the headland green, Is breaking through the midnight screen; Then, lady, wake, our home is nigh, Ah! ne'er can rise on fancy's eye A spot beneath yon azure dome So lovely as the land of home. J. Rodman Drake April 20, 1820 Stanzas Yes, we must sever, Eva dear, But though our sorrows flow, Thy semblance still shall bless me here, In solitude and woe. Though Fate, dear Eva, bids us part, I'll live as warmly true, As when in thy enamored heart Thine image, dearest, grew. With thee were all my loves of youth, My childhood's dreams were thine, Thy name in fond, devoted truth, Was mingled then with mine. When age that shades our bosom's light, Each cherished trace shall wear, That name shall live as pure and bright As when 'twas written there. To Eva Hast thou seen a sunbeam bright Through the ether streaming? Hast thou seen the orb of night On a wave of azure gleaming? Like Luna's glow in Eva's eye, When love and rapture wake the sigh; Like solar beams on summer day, When wit emits a brighter ray. Saw'st thou bathed in pearly dew A rose with crimson blushes glowing? Hast thou seen a violet blueâ A bee that sipped the nectar flowing? The honied dews, the wild bee's sip, Is like the balm on Eva's lip; Those ruby bulbs of bliss disclose The richest tints of Cupid's rose. Hast thou heard the Lesbian lyre, Heavenly strains of rapture breathing? Didst thou see around the wire Blooming garlands love was wreathing? Fragrant as love's flowing wreathes, Is the air that Eva breathes; Lesbian Sappho never sung, The music of my Eva's tongue. Hast thou seen a lily fair, Ope its leaves on summer morning? Didst thou see a dewdrop there, Its heart of virgin snow adorning? That lily, opening to the air, Is like my Eva's bosom fair; That pearly gem, so sparkling clear, An emblem meet of Eva's tear. [Stanzas] Trust not the wile of a woman's eye, Though thy dawn of love be bright; Clear is the blue of the morning sky, But it sets in an endless night. The heart that revels in passion's dream, But feasts on its own decay, As the snow-wreath welcomes the sun's warm beam, And smiles as it melts away. To ? Look not so, the beams that fall From that eye of smiles, Cannot now my heart recall To its hollow wiles; Many a lonely, bitter tear, I have shed in vain, Lady, all thy arts shall ne'er Bid them flow again. Yet those beaming orbs are bright, Still that cheek is fair, And mine eye with strange delight, Loves to linger there; But the heart that falsehood fled, Will not welcome woe, Smiles awaken not the dead, Then lady, look not so. To ? [Eva] Come, love, let thine eye be bright, Thou hast no cause for sorrow, The lip that melts on thine to-night, Shall blush for thee to-morrow. You think that rosy smile mine own, Ah, fain would I believe it, But faith, I know its lustre shone, For all that would receive it. And should I chance to change my seat, I'm sure, for I have tried her, The smile and kiss that now I meet, She'd give the next beside her. For would you know to Eva's breast, What object is the dearest, 'Tis not the man she loves the best, But the one who sits the nearest. Come, come, you'll find her kind enough, Whate'er her form or feature, She ne'er was known to give rebuff, To any two-legged creature. Whate'er his stature, mind, or name, In poverty or riches, Dark, Christian, Jew, 'tis all the same, So he but wear the breeches. [Life and Love] Oh! life is cold and dark, A waste of tears and sighs, Where pleasure's fleeting spark, But beams and dies. Love is an empty name, That leads to pain and woe, And friendship's holy flame, Hath ceased to glow. Yet, oh, if any lie, Wrapt in delusive sleep, Ne'er may his visioned eye, Awake to weep. Oh, still may rapture's beam, In sweet illusions shine, Ne'er may his fairy dream, Vanish like mine. Lines to A Lady 'Twas like the poet's dreaming land, Where fairies tread the moonlight lea, Where sea-nymphs deck the silvery strand, And spirits breathe in melody. The vesper dews were on the wold, The western planet of the day Had lit his glittering lamp of gold In twilight's dim departing ray. 'Twas sweet to see the pale moon weep, O'er the blue wave her tears of light, And list across the swelling deep, The whisper of the winds of night. Borne on the gale of evening mild, The soul of music floating came, Notes that might sooth despair's lorn child, Or light devotion's hallowed dream. Now swelling high in choral song, It seemed the seraph's hymn of praise; Now in swift accents swept along, The green-haired mermaids' thrilling lays. Now murmuring low it sunk remote, Soft as the dying cygnet's wail, Or songs of moonlight fays that float On wings of woven air through some enchanted vale. Such was the night! Dost thou, like me Recall the scene with fond regret? Lives in thine ear that minstrelsy, And on thine eye that moonbeam yet? Additional Verse TO â'TIS NOT THE TEAR,â OF THOMAS MOORE 'Tis the eye where o'er the shade of woe, A wintry smile is gleaming, 'Tis the stifled sigh, suppressed and low, From a heart all torn and streaming; 'Tis the tear that falls, when not an eye Its bitter pang can borrow; 'Tis the sob that bursts when no ear is nigh, To catch its voice of sorrow. [Poetical Fragment] Oh! then in all a poet's dream, Away my cares of earth were hurled; And bright in fancy's fairest beam, Appeared my little fairy world. [Poetical Fragment] In a fair lady's heart once a secret was lurking; It tossed and it tumbled, it longed to get out; The lips half betrayed it, by smiling and smirking, And tongue was impatient to blab it no doubt. Song (AIR, âMUSETTE DE NINAâ) When the silken bands that fettered our youth Are sundered by fate's imperious decree, And the fondest hope of our young heart's truth Shall wither away as a leaf on the tree, Ah! where shall we seek all desolate then, The magical form our bliss to restore? Alas! 'tis in vainâthe heart injured once May throb 'till it break, but never feel more. The wild rose may spring from a desolate rock, And shed o'er its barrenness sweetest perfume; The oak, that hath felt the lightning's shock, May stand, and the ivy around it will bloom. And when it is withered, another will spring, Its tendrils entwine 'round the oak as before, Yet the heart injured once, like the trunk may remain, But the flowers of life will never bloom more. J. R. Drake</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SECTION IV ATTRIBUTED POEMS AND PROSE The Sigh The attribution of this poem is uncertain. As silent and sad by my Eliza I sat, Love fired and tormented my breast; But I trembled and dared not my sufferings relate, And I fain would have lulled them to rest. But my eye that would glisten at times with a tear, And the flush that still glowed on my cheek, Betrayed what I dreaded, yet wished to appear More plainly than language could speak. She saw, and as angels in pity look down On saints that are fated to die, My Eliza hung o'er me, nor killed with a frown, 'Twas compassion that gleamed in her eye. She spoke not; but oh, I could read in her looks, That she'd fain her emotions define, And as gently her hand gently yielded, I took, Her pulse beat as rapid as mine. Yet I trusted not still to my flattering tongue, The bold language of love to apply; But my heart struggled under the weight that so long Had pressed it, and breathed out a sigh. As the rose, when the gay zephyr fans it, will wave And glow with more beautiful stain, So my Eliza looked up deeply blushing, and gave The sigh, all I wished for, again. J. D. To the Moon The attribution of this poem is uncertain. Bright orb, whose silver shadows streak the green, Whose distant rays cast lustre on the waves, I love thy presence, and thy beams serene I joy to contemplate around the caves. Thou fairest planetâmay no envious cloud Arise to quench thy pure majestic light, To veil thy radiance in a dusky shroud, And match thy beauty from the lonely night. Lend, gentle moon, thy soft, untarnished ray, That fills my soul with energy divine. On the dark windings as I bend my way, O let thy light of beauteous lustre shine! For thy mild tints can chase the sigh of woe, And break the cord that chains the thoughts below. J. D. To Eliza The attribution of this poem is uncertain. Sigh not, Eliza, though winter has shrouded, The woodlands in gloom and the valleys in snow, Though the mantle of tempest the azure has clouded, And darkened the orbits that sparkle and glow. Sigh not, my love, though the snow-drop has faded, That laughed on the forehead of life-giving spring, Though the garland is withered that summer had braided, Mid the gold-burnished ringlets of autumn to fling. In the world, in our bosoms of spirit and light, There rises no winter, there rages no storms, No wrecks of the whirlwind, no shadows of night Our quiet invades, or our pleasure deforms. The breezes which played on the brow of the mountain, Blow hoarse through the forest and keen through the dale, Though cold are the sunbeams that glanced on the fountain, And dead is the violet that scented the vale. The beam of affection enlightens our hours, Dispersing the shadows, sorrow, and gloom, For love strews the path of existence with flowers, Perennial in fragrance, eternal in bloom. [To Prince Croaker] The attribution of this poem is uncertain. How is it, Hal, thy out-of-elbow spirit Should throw thy liquid caustic in the air, To fall and scorch the skins of men of merit, And make all Gotham at thy dashes stare? Does it become thee, thou apparent heir To Pindar's loom for weaving frolic verse, To take a fall with every dancing bear, And draw upon thy head a regiment's curse? Was it well done to place great Dr. Mitchill Bare on the points of thy poetic hatchetâ Finding in folly's vesture ugly flaws To make the Gothites ope their grinning jawsâ Merely because the learned doctor tries To make a dinner out of whales and flies? Thou reprobate! thou owest an apology To this phlogobombas of our ichthyology. Say, was thy prudence altogether fled, When thou let'st loose that bull-dog verse of thine, 'Gainst that great poet and his cabbage head Whose verse the learned Holly calls divine? What's more (and this thy impudence enhances), I'm well informed you sent a blistering-plaster To clap upon the chops of Dr. Francis, And ipecac and tartar for his master. But Mr. Johnny, being orthodox, Swore as he might, being in a wondrous fury, He'd not be battering his razor upon blocks, Or bring a broken head before a jury. And that sky-rocket which of late you sent, Filled with most villainous sarcastic matter, To fire among the Peacock Regiment, And gallant Colonel Murray to bespatterâ He'd see thee damned, howe'er thou might desire it, Before he'd let his honest fleer fire it. But go thy ways and give thy fancy play, And, save through Coventry, I'll follow thee; And when thou kill'st the Hotspur of the day, I'll bear the body off and swear 'twas me.</field>
