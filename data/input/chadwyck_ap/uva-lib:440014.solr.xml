      <field name="fulltext">TO PRINCE HAL AND LITTLE QUEEN MAUDE This Book is Dedicated BY THEIR LOYAL AND LOVING FRIEND. NEW-YEAR SONG. There's a New Year coming, coming Out of some beautiful sphere, His baby-eyes bright With hope and delight: We welcome you, Happy New Year! There 's an Old Year going, going Away in the winter drear; His beard is like snow, And his footsteps are slow: Good by to you, weary Old Year! The New Year comes smiling, smiling, While the Old Year hastens away, Unwilling to be The one sorrow to see, In a world so enchanting and gay. The Old Year goes sighing, sighing; Once he was a baby Year; His welcome was glad; But his farewell is sad; He has nothing to stay for here. There is always a New Year coming; There is always an Old Year to go; And never a tear Drops the happy New Year, As he scatters his gifts on the snow. BABY'S DAY. Open your eyes, mamma; Day soon will begin. Open your eyes, mamma! I want to look in. Yesterday, dear mamma, Out of your eyes There peeped two little boys Just of my size. Are they in there now, mamma? Whose can they be? And do you love those boys As you love me? Don't feed me any longer,— Not another minute! Does my mouth look pretty, think, With a great spoon in it? If you people speak the truth, I am sweet enough; There 's no need of choking me With your sugary stuff. Mamma, where are you? You are the sweet! Nicer than all They can give me to eat. Here I am coming,— Toes, fingers, and feet! Have you a kiss or two Growing for me? Where do you hide them? Please let me see! Now I shall steal them,— One, two, and three. What is the next thing For baby to do? Duckie, I think, I'll go swimming with you. Doggie, look sharp, And if we get drowned, Fish us both out, You friendly old hound! Dick, we'll on our travels go, I 've two feet, don't hold me so! O, my shoes won't walk a bit! Down upon the floor I'll sit. If you think I 've had a fall, You 're mistaken, that is all! But why will this old house shake, Every single step I take? Now get out my pony, Dick! Whoa! gee up there! where 's my stick? Over the world and away to the moon, Clever old Dick, we must get there soon, Or the barley-candy will all be sold, And we can't buy a ginger-bread horse for gold. O, the sand blows in my eye, Here is Noddy's Isle close by; And,—don't tell me that I fib!— Dick, it looks just like my crib. Good night, pony! Trot away! I 've done riding for to-day, And I hear my mother sing, Sweet, O sweet as anything!— My baby shall go To the Island of Sleep, Where soft little dream-waves Around him will creep. And when the moon rises, Away in her boat, With the stars rowing races All night he shall float. And when morning's red horses Spring out of the sea, As swift as a sunbeam He'll come back to me. THE BABY'S THOUGHTS. “I wonder what the baby thinks. Just see how wide awake she lies, And crows at me, and chirps, and winks, With laughing wonder in her eyes.” I'll answer for her, little girl.— “Whose can it be, that merry face, With hair like sunbeams in a curl, That hangs around my nestling-place? “At three months old I've much to learn, For everything looks strange to me. But then I know enough to turn To all the brightest things I see. “Red roses on the curtain grow, Once, when 't was up, I saw a star. I wonder, Brown Eyes, if you know How many splendid things there are? “Now don't you wish you were n't so tall? Then you 'd live in a cradle, too, And talk to shadows on the wall, And think you heard them talk to you. “But, then, I could n't spare you, dear; For when I wake from pretty dreams, And that great sun goes by, so near, You seem like one of his soft beams. “I guess that you, and mother too, Are pieces broken from the sun. No; she 's the sun, a sunbeam you; For when she goes, away you run. “I lie here guessing every day What all the things around can be; This four-walled world in which I stay Is full of wonders, dear, to me.”— There, little girl, your sunny face Will give the baby thoughts like these; Then let no frown your brow disgrace, But be the loveliest thing she sees. SPRING WHISTLES. Down by the gate of the orchard This Saturday afternoon, Harry and Arthur and Willie Are getting their whistles in tune. Different notes they are playing; Different echoes they hear: Always the best of the music Is in the musician's ear. Harry says, “Hark! when I whistle, March winds are wild on the hills; Waterfalls break from the snow-drifts; Their thunder the forest fills. Thousands of bluebirds and sparrows Sing on the branches bare; Oceans of musical murmurs Ripple and stir in the air.” Arthur is whispering, “Listen! Dropping of April showers,— Dripping of rainy rosebuds,— Flight of the rustling hours;— And a speckled lark in the meadow, That utters one long sad note, As if all the sorrow of gladness Were hid in his little throat.” “Whistle, O whistle!” cries Willie. “Never such echoes could be Coaxed from a twig of the willow As wait in my whistle for me. When I shape at last the mouth-piece And let the rich music out, You will think that Pan or Apollo Is wandering hereabout: “You will dream of orchards in blossom, Of lambs in the grass at play; And of birds that warble all summer The wonderful songs of May.” No doubt of it, Will! in the whistle That nobody yet has played, Is sleeping a melody sweeter Than ever on earth was made. GIPSY CHILDREN'S SONG White little housed-up things, Why don't you run Out in the sun? Beauty that blossoms and sings Never was made Strong in the shade. Why do you shadow the face Pale as a doll's, Now the wind calls, “Hurry, and give us a chase”? Where the winds blow Roses will grow. Here we swing high on the bough! Down comes the rain, Blackberry stain Washing from bare cheek and brow, Fresh as a flower After the shower. We and the pine-trees are glad When the winds talk Through a split rock Till they go merrily mad, Making us shake,— Laugh till we ache. Then in the warm lull of noon Sleepy we slide Down the rill-side, Dropping away to its tune Into a dream Bright as the stream. Always at home with you, Sun!— Mother, so high Up in the sky, Smiling out full on our fun,— Paint us with tan Brown as you can! O little housed-up things! Blue is the air, Breezy and fair; Borrow a bird's idle wings; Then you may be Merry as we! MANITOU'S GARDEN. Come, play in my garden!” Called flaxen-haired Fred, Peeping out from the edge Of a hyacinth-bed, Through the stout oaken rails At a Chippewa boy Who ran along, dragging A snake, for a toy. “I'll give you some flowers To twist in your hair.” “The son of a sachem No blossoms will wear That the white man has planted; Nor yet will he go Where roses and lilies Like pale captives grow. “In Manitou's garden Are gay flowers to see: Come out, little pale-face, And play here with me! The fawn will play with us,— The squirrel and hare; No fences to stop us,— We 're free as the air. “In Manitou's garden How bright is the dawn! We know where his trail Through the deer-path has gone. The moccasin-flower Springs up where he stopped; And the dewdrops are beads, From his blanket's edge dropped.” “I'm afraid, little Indian, To come out to you. I'm afraid of the snakes, And the barking wolves, too.” “Ugh! white-hearted pale-face, They 're Manitou's snakes; And the wolves are the hounds That a-hunting he takes. “We, too, on wild mustangs Chase bisons and deer. We are Manitou's hunters, A race without fear. Our arrow's flight leaves The swift eagle behind. Whoop! after them, quick As the rushing north-wind!” But the son of the Chippewa Stands there alone, At his whoop timid Fred To his mother has flown. Off the red boy runs, shouting, “Whoop! whoop! let him be! In Manitou's garden Are playmates for me!” DUMPY DUCKY. Quack, quack, quack, Three white and four black. Your coat, you saucy fellow, Shades off to green and yellow: Do you think I like you best Because you are prettiest? Quack, quack, quack! White spots on his back, Chasing his long-necked brothers, I see him, old duck-mothers;— You need not quack so loud, Nor look so stiff and proud. Quack, quack, quack! Ducks, you have a knack Of talking and saying nothing, And showing off fine clothing Like many folks I see Who wiser ought to be. Quack, quack, quack! Please to stop your clack! They call me Dumpy Ducky; Do you not think you are lucky, You, ducklings all, to be Named for a girl like me? Quack, quack, quack! What is there that we lack,— You with a pond for swimming, I with my bucket brimming,— You with your web-toes neat, I with my stout bare feet? Quack, quack, quack! You make a funny track When you waddle through the garden. And, ducks, I beg your pardon, But I do not choose to try A swim in your pond; not I! Quack, quack, quack! Now you may all turn back, Your home is in the water; I am the Dutchman's daughter, And my plump little sisters cry, “We want a drink!” Good b'ye! JESSIE'S BOOK. Here lingering, Jessie? And what is your book? And what the gay picture That fastens your look? I cannot guess, Jessie; Still seems it to me A lovelier picture Your raised eyes would see. The late birds are flying Through sunshine's soft floods; Cool shadows are lying Beside the warm woods; There are gentians and frost-flowers In dim dingles hid; Sleeps beauty the bowers Of autumn amid. To sit here and read On the pleasant old stile Is a fine thing indeed; Yet those pages may wile Your thoughts from a story More wonderful still, That hangs a wild glory Round meadow and hill. For Nature, dear Jessie, Has something to say She will not say over Again, any day. And if I were Jessie My book I would close, And read the fresh marvels Her latest page shows. When angry November Has torn the bright leaves, You will not remember What tints Autumn weaves. Go, con the blue river, The torrent, the brook, Ere winter forever Seal up this year's book! THE CLOCK-TINKER. Tinker, may I learn the trick,— How you cure a clock that's sick, Peeping in her face behind, (Are those wheels her brains?) to find Why her pulses do not go Regular and sure and slow? Tinker, have you learned Time's trick,— How it is he makes clocks tick? Is there such a thing as knowing What it was first set them going? Do you, sir, suppose they had 'em In their garden, Eve and Adam? Is there, up among the suns,— Father of these other ones,— Some great timepiece that can show All the small clocks how to go? Are the stars set right by some Mighty swinging pendulum? Tinker, where's the loosened screw That the juggler Time creeps through When he slips into his place, Up behind the old clock's face? Have you ever seen that feat? Or does Time even graybeards cheat? “Boy, I've tried through Time to see, But he played strange tricks with me. While I gave the wizard chase, He was dancing on my face. Look you! like a crow he flies; Here 's his track around my eyes.” CAT-QUESTIONS. Dozing, and dozing, and dozing! Pleasant enough, Dreaming of sweet cream and mouse-meat,— Delicate stuff! Of raids on the pantry and hen-coop,— Or light, stealthy tread Of cat-gossips, meeting by moonlight On ridge-pole or shed.— Waked by a somerset, whirling From cushion to floor; Waked to a wild rush for safety From window to door. Waking to hands that first smooth us, And then pull our tails; Punished with slaps when we show them The length of our nails! These big mortal tyrants even grudge us A place on the mat. Do they think we enjoy for our music Staccatoes of “scat”? What in the world were we made for? Man, do you know? By you to be petted, tormented?— Are you friend or foe? To be treated, now, just as you treat us,— The question is pat,— To take just our chances in living, Would you be a cat? SISTER AND BLUEBIRDS. The bluebirds, the bluebirds, Are out there in the snow; The meaning of their music No heedless ear may know. The violet's forerunner Is that faint bud of song, And after it the harebells Will troop, a blue-eyed throng. They drift their fluttering azure Across the snow-sheets white; And underneath, the daisies Are stirring toward the light. And soon the purple crane-bill And golden buttercup For overbrimming sunshine Will hold their goblets up. The bluebirds, the bluebirds! 'T is but the fifth of March, Yet, though there hangs no tassel On alder, birch, or larch, They never have deceived us: If summer always came Too slowly for our wishes, Their song was not to blame. This earliest May-day herald, This prophet of the spring Has brought celestial color Upon his breezy wing. Heaven loves to scatter earthward Flakes of its own soft hue; The first bird, the last blossom, Wear the same shade of blue. The bluebirds, the bluebirds! We heard them through the snow, When we were baby playmates, A long, long time ago. Our birthday slid in music Down the sky's reddening arch; We came here with the bluebirds, 'Mid snow and song, in March. The world slips through its changes, And we change year by year; But childhood lives within us Forever fresh and dear. All miracles and visions That used the earth to fill, When life was one great sunrise, Are in the bluebird's trill. BRING BACK MY FLOWERS. A child beside a rivulet With half-blown flowers Sat garlanded: She scattered them, with dewdrops wet, While noiseless hours Unnoticed sped. She threw them on the sparkling stream,— Her blossoms bright,— Till all were gone. She saw her rosebuds' eddying gleam, As out of sight They drifted on. “Bring back my flowers!” aloud she cried. With toss of spray The idle wave Sent mocking echoes to her side, But bore away The gift she gave. O little child beside life's stream, Love garlands you With moments bright: The days are wasting while you dream: Their bloom and dew Fade out of sight. Let gentle thoughts and gentler deeds With fragrance rare Fill all your hours! For Time glides on, and never heeds Your weeping prayer, Bring back my flowers!” NEW-YEAR'S WISHES. New-year's morning softly broke As a little girl awoke, And, half rising in her bed, To her drowsy sister said: “Waken, Annie! Where 's the bird? Where 's the singing that I heard? Birds and birds went to and fro, Thick and white as flakes of snow, Singing sweetly as they flew; Never came such music through Thrush's beak or linnet's throat. How I wished that I could float In the air, and sing so, too! Listen, Annie! one bird flew In here, fluttering down to you. How he came I could not learn; But the white tips of the fern Jack Frost painted on the pane Waved in and waved out again, As that white bird came and went. O, I wonder what it meant! Warm, soft wings and bubbling song; Where, where could those birds belong, Making all the frosty sky Tingle, ring, as they went by?” Annie murmured: “Strange, you seem Not to know it was a dream.” “O, but, Annie! wake and hear! Happy New Year to you, dear! Wake up! It is New-Year's day! On your pillow there's a ray Of the golden morning sun.” Then a low voice: “Little one, Of the birds I heard you tell, And I know their meaning well. New-Year's wishes, happy words, Were the dear white singing-birds Thronging in the snowy air. Think how sweet, if everywhere, When a loving word were said, Birds went warbling overhead! And, perhaps, to ear and eye Of the watchers in the sky So it is; with each kind thought Song and flash of wing is brought To our world from gardens bright, Where no winter is, nor night. Call your birds the Christ-child's doves; For the music that he loves Is the carol, ‘Peace! Good-will!’ Echoing from his birthday still; And the birthday of the year Brings again the Christ-child here.” “Then the bird on Annie's head Was the New-Year's wish I said, Mother darling? This does seem Something better than a dream.”</field>
