      <field name="fulltext">SELECTED EARLY POEMS WINTER [Mr. Shirleyâthe following effusion was handed to me by a friend, and I now offer it to you for an insertion in your Gazette. It has some faults, but is the production of a youthful muse and therefore I hope its imperfections will be overlooked.â Yours, &amp;c. Amicus.] Autumn has fled; and hoary Winter now O'er hill and dale has spread his drear domain, Covering with fleecy snow the fertile plain. With piercing storms the winds tempestuous blow And block the way. The streams refuse to flowâ Ev'n Nature's self, close bound with icy chain, With meek submission, owns stern Winter's reign. Congeal'd before the frown of his dark threat'ning browâ And ah! how hard the helpless wanderer's lot Who roams alone upon some hostile strand, And sighs to tread once more his native land, To meet those friends by memory ne'er forgot, And hail, yet once again, that fertile spot, Where Friendship binds him with her strongest band. H. January 22, 1821 [THERE'S NOT A CLOUD] There's not a cloud in yon blue sky, So beautiful and clear! There's not a wind, that breathes on high Its music to my ear!â But sentry stars, at night's still noon, Are watching 'round the crescent moon, Where beaming full and fair, Her silver lamp in heaven is hung, And songs from many a seraph tongue Sound to the clear cold air. How beautiful, whilst faint and far The rushing tempest speeds, By the bright morn and wandering star, The Night, her young-hours leads!â Methinks, that from this world of pain The Spirit could take wing again, On such a night as this, And purified from the gross earth,â The sorrows of a mortal birth,â Fly off to worlds of bliss. There is a beauty in the light Of the moon's silver beam,â A holiness in that still height Like young love's earliest dream!â A quiet in the hour of sleep, When the sad spirit wakes to weep The sorrows of its days, That comes upon me, as the wing Of the light gale of fragrant Spring Around the lute-chord plays. And thou art fair, thou New-born Year, Though, heralding thy birth, The night-wind moan'd through woodlands sere, And wav'd their branches forth,â Though the night-dirge, above the grave, Was the sole musick Winter gave, To bid thine advent speed!â For his rude hand had broken in pride The lute of Nature's Summer tide, And Autumn's mellow reed. H. January 14, 1824. THE POOR STUDENT ... A DRAMATIC SKETCH. IN THREE PARTSâ PART FIRST. Scene.âA small chamber in a cottageâA lattice with woodbine, through which the moon shinesâSummer, Midnightâ The Poor Student sitting by a dying lamp. Seymour. Why do thy watches speed so fast, sweet Night? Why does the lamp grow dim upon my vigils, And the spirit falter, when the wings Of the imagination would go on? Why is the flesh weak, and the eye so dim With over-watching, and yet know no rest? 'Tis that the spirit hath not strength to bear The burthen of our gross mortality! 'Tis that the heart bows in its solitude To patient study and its midnight care; And, like the silver lute-chord, when o'erstrained, Wearied by long and frequent watchings, breaks. Sad is th' inheritance of pain, that waits The child of genius and the son of song! Sad the return for unrepining toil, And wasting study o'er the midnight lamp! The broken spirit, and the ambitious pride Of buoyant youth crush'd down to earth forever; The troubled eye, the brow of pale cold beauty, The glow of brighter hope decaying there; And feverish dreams, that haunt the couch of sleep; These are the seals of genius, and the crowns Of thorns, with woven flowers, her sons must wear Upon their aching brows until they bleed. And thou art beautiful, thou waning moon, Whose silver lamp is hung in yon blue sky, Shedding a glow of melancholy light! And I have lov'd thee in my saddest hour, When other loves had faded; and in thee Have found a power to soothe, when was no other,â A loneliness, that answer'd to my own. And thou art far upon thine orbit, whilst Around thee countless hosts of stars are met, And rolling spheres are at their midnight hymns. Sweet through the open'd lattice, and around The quiv'ring woodbine the cool night breeze plays, And fans with trembling wing my feverish cheek. Nature looks lovely; and the moonlight sleeps On the blue distant mountain, whilst the voice Of dashing waters from the Summer vale Breaks on my ear. And this is beautiful! But I am sick at heart, and faint!â Seymour and Gertrude Gertrude O Seymour, Still do thy vigils keep thine eyes from sleep!â Still does the wasting lamp shine dim upon The midnight page, that soon shall be to thee The chronicle of sorrow and disease! Cease from thy study,â'tis the hour of sleep, And thou hast need of sleep, for thou art weary. Seymour Gertrude, kind Gertrude, slumber will not seal My aching eyes, until the night is spent And the gray morning has begun its watches. Why then should I lie down upon my couch Of restless fever, where my limbs will tremble, My lips be dry and parch'd, and my brow burn? No! at the open lattice I will stand, And gaze on nature with her moonlight veil. The night is pleasant to me, and the breeze Comes from the wood-crown'd mountain, with a light And lively song, to kiss my pallid brow, That is already fever'd!âTake my hand. Gertrude Alas, how hot and dry it is! O Seymour, I fear thou art not well! thy pulse is high, Thy cheek is deadly pale, and thy hand trembles! O watch no longer; thou art wearied by it, And it is over late, for midnight wanes. Seymour Were I to seek my couch, I could not sleepâ And if I could, strange dreams would visit me, Thoughts of the mournful yew, and of the grave; And this would be but weariness; besides, The morning is not yet; and I have wished The morning breeze was fresher and more chill. My hours of midnight study are not many, Why should I lessen them by restless sleep? Gertrude Thy watchings, Seymour, are too long and frequent: For I have noted them, and often seen The light of thy dim taper tremble on The leafy woodbine that hangs round thy lattice, When others were asleep, and thou didst think No eye was looking on thy patient toil. To-night I knew thou wast not sleeping, and I came to warn thee, that 't was time to rest. Seymour Dear Gertrude, I am faint and sick to-night, And very sad, ev'n more than I am wont. But though I may not sleep, yet thanks to thee For those kind words of thine and kinder thoughts:â For ever was the tone of feeling higher Within thy bosom, than thy tongue could tell. Gertrude Thy wasted lamp is quiv'ring in its socket! It has gone out,âand I must leave thee now. Thy spirits will be lighter in the morningâ Good night! Good night! Seymour O go not yet, for I Am very sorrowful, and fain would have Thy voice to cheer me,âbut thou too art sad. How this hand trembles!âBut look out and see Where beautiful the setting moon goes down! There are no mists about it, and no cloud To dim its holy brightness at departing! Thus, purified from all earth's grossness, would My spirit bid the world and thee farewell! For as in Heav'n her night-hours, so on earth My days are number'd, and will soon be spent. List! and thine ear will shortly hear the faint And midnight music of the wind and wave Swell o'er the upland and in distance die! So shall I perish, and my memory, Leaving no trace behind upon the earth; Life's but a song of saddest harmony. Thou saw'st the midnight lamp grow dull and dim, Revive and fade by turns, and then sink down, And with a pale and quiv'ring flame go out! Cherish'd by thought and dim'd again by fears, Such is the life of man!âand so the lamp Of his existence often beams the brightest When lowest in the socket, till at last Wasted by one great effort, it goes out. For oft the brightest glow is on the cheek Where death has set his fatal seal most firmly, And flow'rs are often found upon the grave's brink. Gertrude Thy thoughts dwell too much on the mournful grave, Dear Seymour!âWould that thou wert happier, Knowing no sorrow in thy dreams by night, Nor in thy waking thoughts. Oh! I should be Of cheerful heart and lighter spirit then; And thy poor mother, though bow'd down with age, Would bear the burthen of her years less sadly!â Alas! I know not how it is, that still My feelings have a melancholy tone, That suits the sadness of thy countenance, And then are livelier, when the cheerful glow Of health and gladness is upon thy cheek. Sleep, then, and rest thee; and may morning find Thou hast a lighter heart than now! Good night!â Seymour Good night, dear Gertrude; and bright dreams be thine, Till morning comes again, with her gemm'd wings Waving in beauty on the eastern hills!â(Gertrude goes out.) And roll the wings of night so swiftly on?â They move more slowly now!âfor nought so much As care and sorrow stay the feet of Time. And is it wise that man, who at its close Becomes so avaricious of this life, Should deem the hours time's hand has portioned out As his inheritance, pass off too slowly? Why should men say, that life is short, and yet Waste the bright morning of their younger days? Or that the Autumn-harvest brings no fruit, When Spring's sweet blossoms faded through neglect? Alas! Philosophy may never teach The lesson from experience we can learn, That life, which seems through hope's perspective glass An age, is but a day to memory's eye. (The scene closes.) Part Second. Sequestered Woodland SceneryâEarly Morning. Seymour The music of the morning,âthe loud hymn Of the wing'd tenants of the woodland, and The rushing song of the breathing winds above them, With the deep voice of falling waves, and faint The far, long-swelling peal of village bells,â Break full and cheerfully upon night's stillness. The summer sky is cloudless, and the air Breathes with a clear, cold freshness, as the Hours Roll back the flood-gates of the eastern light, And full the Spring-tide of the morning gushes. Dark in its sheeted mirror, where yon stream Spreads its blue waters to a wider bound, The woodland waves reflected, and below As fair a Heaven expands as that above, With the lark's wild-wing fanning in the ether. So! heralding Hyperion's advent, bright The morning star glows like an orb of fire, Full in the Orient, where the deeper blue Of Heaven is ting'd with streaks of silver light, And other stars seem joyless in the day-spring. If in these rolling spheres, as man has deem'd, The creature in the great Creator's image made, Though of a higher rank than ours, inhabits, A link in the great chain of being, form'd Connecting man with angels,âor if there, Spirits of higher and of holier birth, Have their allotted dwellings, with what eyes Did they look down on our rebellious earth When waters were its grave, and man in death Had lost his rich inheritance of joy? O, did they weep when clouds of sin were round it, And as a wandering planet it rolled on; Unheard the music of the verging spheres, Though not unseen the beauty of their brightness? Or purified from tears, did they behold, With pitying eyes, our frailty and transgression?â But man may task his wisdom all in vain, To light the clouded mystery of what The free imagination may aspire to! And reason's pinion stoops to earth again, Tho' visionary fancy journeys on!â Now as the morning blushes o'er the hills, And brighter glows, I'll turn my feet along The path that winds beside the river's margin. (Goes out.) Gertrude and a Peasant Girl, enter on the opposite side. Peasant Girl This way he passed but deadly pale he was, And his wild eye was gazing on the sky As he would read his fate amongst the stars! I pray thee not to followâhe might hurt thee!â Gertrude Hurt me, child!ânever!âwe have grown Together from our childhood, and since then Never has been my name on Seymour's lips, Except in kindness; and the early bud, That friendship plac'd between us is full-blown Into the flower of love. And think'st thou now That he would hurt me? Peasant Girl Ah! I could not tell, But then he look'd so wildly, and his cheek Was pale as death, and then was flush'd again, And chang'd as did my brother's ere he died! His step was hurried too, and now and then He stopp'd and spoke, but it was to himself,â None else was near. Gertrude Hush! child, you frighten me! And yet say on! what heard or saw you more? Peasant Girl I know no more: for he had pass'd me then, As I was standing on the trembling plank, That bridges yonder brook. Now let us go! Gertrude Ah no!ânot yet!âsay, which way did he go? Peasant Girl He took the left-hand path that leads this way, And farther onward to the waterfall. Farewell. (Goes out.) Gertrude O Seymour, this is then the fruit Of thy long studies in the hours of sleep! Thy midnight cares have blasted thee, and wither'd The zeal and beauty of thy youth away, And the rich pride of dawning manhood, which An early piety kept holy, and Free from pollution, pure, and passionless, Unless the gush of wild and youthful feeling, And brighter love, that knew no shade nor change, Were deem'd thy passions. But the glow of health Has faded like the rainbow's tints away, And the deep hectic flush is on his cheek, That, like the sere red leaf in Autumn, speaks Decay and dissolution! He is here!â Seymour and Gertrude Seymour Ah, Gertrude! I had wish'd to meet you here, For I have had forebodings sad and fearful, Of coming ill; and I have risen up To feel the morning breezes fresh and free, Breathing along the woodland, and to hear The cheerful song of lighter hearts than mine. I had a dream last night, and it has left Dark traces on my mind, who am not wont To take much thought of dreams. But this has spoken Of the mysterious future, with a voice That will be heard and listen'd to, though fearful. I thought the freshness of the morning air Might cheer my spirit, but I strive in vain To chase away those shadow'd images, That becon dimly to my waking thoughts, And bid them follow on, as in my dreams. Nor is my heart less troubled; for which way I turn, faintly before my eyes they move. This was my dream. I thought I stood at night In a sick chamber by the couch of pain, When life and death were struggling for the mast'ry. Waving and dim a lamp stood by the couch, And soon was wasted and went out! And then Deep was the struggle of mortality;â The flame of being quiver'd and was quench'd. The moon shone dimly down!âGertrude 't was thee! I touch'd thy brow, 't was cold and pale.âI spake But silence seal'd thy lips; and I awoke. Trembling and faint I rose, but still that dream Floats faint and fearfully before my eyes!â Gertrude And dwell thy thoughts so long on such a dream? A buoyant spirit as thine used to be, And a mind strong by nature, would not deem That such as these were proper themes for thought. But love shall bring forgetfulness of this! And by the friendship of our earlier years, The plighted vows of our affection, and Our thoughts and hopes of better days to come, I do beseech thee to forget such dreams!â Seymour That love must have an end full soon, unless It can survive the ruin of the grave! And all the tenderness of former years, Present affection, and our future hopes, Be wither'd with me or bloom o'er the tomb! Gertrude O do not look so wildly on me, Seymour, Nor let thy thoughts be of the grave. Long years And happier shall yet be ours, and love Shall smile, whose smile survives the grave. Seymour Listen, dear Gertrude, for these words may be The last my lips shall utter on this theme! When the long sleep of death shall come upon me, Let that affection which through sorrow glows, That love which warmed our hearts in earlier years, Linger around the grave that keeps my dust, And consecrate the melancholy place, And let it fade,âif it should ever fade,â As does the echo of the mellow flute, Breathed o'er the sweet and silver-chorded lyre. That love impressed so deeply on thy heart, Should be the record of departed life, Nor perish sooner than the marble stone, That chronicles the name of him beneath! (The scene closes.) Part Third. The Waterfall, and the Grave of SeymourâSummer, Sunset. Gertrude And art thou here no longer? Has the voice Of fearful destiny called unto thee, And has his hand seal'd thy affectionate lips, Forever and forever? I have watch'd Until the going down of the bright sun, And his last beam is sleeping on thy grave! Thine is a dreamless sleep, that knows no waking, But he shall shine upon the earth again! The groves are green around me, yet full soon Nature shall tune her harp of Autumn tide, Winds wake upon the mountain, and a sound Be in the valley of fast falling leaves, Scatter'd and sere, and rustling; so must fade The pride, the bloom, and beauty of the Summer, And solemn Autumn in the garb of age, And nature worn and weary soon decay. But unto nature shall be youth again!â She shall give birth to Spring, and Spring to flowers; Summer and Autumn shall again go by And frozen Winter,âcircling round the earth. But thou art in the grave,âthat has no portal,â The grave, where youth can never dawn again, Where love is not, nor heard the voice of mirth, Where is no fear, nor hope, nor tears, nor sadness, Nor chance, nor change, like what are on the earth. O mournful, mournful is the dashing wave, Where bright and broken o'er the steep it rolls, And gushes wild among its moss-grown rocks;â This was his frequent and his favorite haunt, At morning and at evening, and these groves Have known his wanderings, and have heard the sighs Of his so young, but worn and wasted spirit.â And it is meet, that he should sleep at last, In this wild spot, with which he was familiar, That the same winds, that caught his sighs before, Might breathe them o'er his low and lonely grave, And the same boughs, whose shade he lov'd in life, Should wave, mournfully wave above his slumber!â Why am I here? The past with all its joys And sorrows, and its smiles and tears, is gone! The lamp of Hope, that beam'd in other days A light of beauty on my happier years, Is washed, Misprint for wasted? dim'd, and gone! Why linger I? I hear a mournful voice none else may hear! I see a spectred form, that becons me! It points me to the grave!âSeymour, I come.â(Goes out.) Two Peasants First Peasant This is a lonely spot, yet beautiful, That he has chosen for his silent rest From this world's troubles,âfor his last cold couch, And his last slumber, long, but still not wakeless. And yet if spirits from their graves come forth To walk the earth at night-fall, and the spots, That were the habitations of the dust They tenanted, his spirit too shall haunt These shadowing groves he loved so well in life, And on the night-breeze melancholy speak. Second Peasant They say, that troubled spirits always walk, While dust is mingling with its dust again, And it would seem, that his, so sad in life, Would not sleep quiet in its lonely grave, Where is no silent fellowship in death, And no communion with those gone before, But would come back to visit us again. First Peasant Poor Gertrude, she will die of grief! For he Was all her hope, and he is wither'd now! Second Peasant He died in peace: and yet 't is said sad sounds Were heard at night, and he had seen sad dreams, Ere yet his mournful spirit was set free. Still it would seem that death was sweet to him, If it were not that Gertrude would be left Lonely and comfortless in this wide world. First Peasant Hist! hist! some one is here! The Peasants and a Stranger Stranger Peace, gentle friends!â Unless my truant feet have led me far From the right path, the peasant pointed out, 'T is somewhere near this spot a person dwells Known by the name of Seymour. I have come With tidings that will be of joy to him And those that are dear to him. Know ye Aught of his dwelling? Second Peasant Stranger, it is there! (Points to the grave.) Stranger. What!âin the grave?âThe grave, so cold and silent! Then is the hand that would have sav'd, too late!â The voice, that would have call'd from tears to joy, Unheard!âthe friend, that would have cherish'd, Come but to see the green turf on the grave Of him, that cold neglect has wither'd! But yet the friendship, that was ours before, Shall not be crush'd by death's unsparing hand: For as the impress of the seal remains, Though the frail wax that holds it may be broken, So youthful friendship lingers though Original reading, through. the heart, Where time more deeply had impress'd it, breaks!â He had an aged mother with him, and A maid of somewhat greener years. To them The proffer'd gift may not be brought in vain. And how bear they the chastening rod? First Peasant The mother Relies upon a hope, that never falters!â But Gertrude, she, so young is broken-hearted! (A corpse is precipitated over the waterfall.) Second Peasant 'T is she!â't is she!â First Peasant Gertrude!â Stranger. Then nought is left, Save 't is to light'n the burthen of Old Age, And smooth a few short footsteps to the grave!â Now lead me to the desolated dwelling, Over whose threshold have the feet of death So lately pass'd! Second Peasant This way the foot-path leads. End of the Poor Student. April, 1824 TO THE NOVICE OF THE CONVENT OF THE VISITATION If e'er within thine holy cell Aught but devotion's thoughts may dwell, And if thine ear may listen more To the kind voice it knew before, Sweet sister! o'er Love's broken urn Let memory's vestal taper burn; Though hope has turned with weary wing To Heav'n its holier wandering! Love has but fix'd on Heaven thine eyes, A broken heart the sacrifice! Time's ruthless hand has but effac'd In thee the lines that beauty trac'd; For me it strikes the chord of death! Whilst Heav'n recalls the wasting breath! Hark!âsounds to prayer the vesper bell;â Sister! 't is my last farewell! H. W. L. April, 1824 JEPTHAH'S DAUGHTER Daughters of Mizpeh!âweep for those Who fade from earth in beauty's prime!â For her o'er whom in youth shall close The voiceless sepulchre of time!â Alas!âthat this sad voice ere long Shall sigh among the chords of death: That none shall hear my nuptial song And Heaven so soon recall my breath. Great God! why sleeps the gifted tongue, At whose command in heaven stood still The Moon, o'er Ajalon that hung, The Sun, that shone on Gibeon's hill!â Could not the hand, that freed our race From Ammon's dark idolatries, Have turn'd in shame the warrior's face, And I not bled in sacrifice!â Fountain of light!âfrom whom is caught The glow that cheers death's gloomy vale, From whom descends the heaven-born thought, That breathes in song from lips grown pale; Father of life!âon trembling wings My wounded spirit flies to thee!â I hear the sound of angels' strings,â Their harps in heavenly musick see!â Thou that from Tubia âThen Jepthah fled from his brethren and dwelt in the land of Tob.ââ Judges c. xi, 3. came,âfor whom, Broken in everything but love,â The child of sorrow seeks the tomb, Whilst Heaven receives the soul above,â Oâturn not from thy sacred vow, Nor faint beneath the chastening rod!â In death before thy face I bow,â In death approach the throne of God. Daughters of Mizpeh weep!âthe sigh Of mountain winds around is heard, And with a mournful song flits by, On storm-drench'd wing the trembling bird; But I,âpoor dove of heaven,âfull soon Shall rest in death's eternal sleep:â And oft beneath the silent moon O'er me shall Israel's daughters weep. H. September 22, 1824. OLD PARISH CHURCH [Written on hearing that the aged building was soon to be removed for the erection of a new one.] Our Fathers' temple!âo'er thy form In peace time's holy twilight falls:â Yet heavenly light glows pure and warm Around thy venerable walls:â The shades of years have mellow'd long But not obscured the light of God;â Though they, that plac'd thee here, shall throng No more the courts where once they trod. Alas!âO'er thee Old Time hath cast The mournful mantle of decay:â His feet have o'er thy threshold past,â His hand hath pluck'd thy strength away!â Nor think we, as we gaze on thee, How soon the hand, that seals thy doom, Shall waste our own vitality, And hide our ashes in the tomb! Pointing to Heaven,âour resting place,â Thy spire its ancient form uprears, And still upon thy walls we trace The gray and gathering moss of years!â Still from thy tower the deep-ton'd bell Time's silent lapse proclaims on high; Still breathes its long and last farewell To perishing mortality. Now as at eve, with solemn feet Thy consecrated aisles I tread, Those that surround the mercy-seat Seem here unto thine altar led. I see the venerable hand,â The patriarchs of our infant Church,â I see the weak and trembling hand Again the heavenly volume search! And as the eye, grown dim in time, With awe reviews the inspir'd page, I hear the voice of truth sublime Break quivering from the lips of age!â Kneeling around thine altars old Those holy men have joined in prayer, That Israel's God would keep his fold, And bless the shepherd of his care. And hark!âto Heaven the tuneful song In soft and mellow musick steals:â And now the anthem swells, and long The solemn-breathing organ peals!â My soul to earth resigns its fears, Flush'd with the glowing dream of Heaven: It sees thy sainted Sires,âand hears The song of peace and sins forgiven. Ye holy men of God belov'd, Who bow forever at his throne, Ye in whose breast his spirit mov'd, Whose thoughts and lives were all his own,â Within this temple, when below, The precepts of his love ye gave,â And shall his temple perish now, Without one hand outstretch'd to save? Thou hoary monarch, Time! awhile From ruin spare this holy place! Shall Peace desert the hallow'd aisle,â And Mercy's cherub veil her face?â Still may our Fathers' Temple shine The record of departed years!â Still may we worship at its shrine,â Still bathe its altars with our tears. H. September 25, 1824 NIGHT-FALL IN NOVEMBER How calm is night-fall!â Westward the sun speeds down his steep descent In beautiful stillness, far more eloquent Than musick or the sound of winds,âaway The sea-bird from its dim and motionless bay Wings silently,âand o'er the distant mountain Ebbs the last wave of evening's purple fountain. Twilight hangs mournfully upon the brown And wasted woods, where once the trees bent down In summer beauty, and the warm blue sky Was full of fawning gales, and they of melody. Far toward the north, the silver cloud rests bright Upon its sea of clear and amber light, As rests the island on its waters.âSoon With a wan countenance the Autumn moon Looks from her mid-sky turrets, and aside Not half withdraws Earth's shadowing veil to hide The mellow beauty of her eye,âmore fair As more unseen the beauty, that is there!â Trac'd with distinct, dark outline, and a still And beautiful imagery, the distant hill Mount Washington and its company of lesser hills, when seen in our clear Autumnal twilight, though less bright, are scarcely less beautiful, than when they appear with their bright snows shining in the atmosphere of an early Spring-morning. Encompass'd with its thin blue haze, and cold With snows, stands out from the pale sky in bold And strongly mark'd relief, yet not a cloud Dimming its chiller atmosphere.âAloud After an interval of rest, from Ocean The rushing winds come with a fitful motion, Gathering and gathering, till the stronger gale Pipes cheerfully, and fills the lagging sail, And swift the light bark cleaves the parted surge. Night darkens!âyet upon the utmost verge Of the deep sea, the distant light-house rears Its form of dazzling beauty, where it cheers The desert, pathless waters, and presides Over their ebbing and full-flowing tides, Like a bright spirit, that untiring waits To guide the seaman, ere the storm abates!â At home, and gather'd round the social hearth We listen to the wind's wild musick.âEarth Strips bare her frozen bosom, and the treesâ So like ourselves in times of health, disease, Decay, and chilling death, and then to dust Mouldering away again, as all flesh must,â Send back life's vigorous current to the spring, From which at first they drew it. No light wing Waves in those branches, that the sere leaf covers, For like a cheerless mourner Autumn hovers O'er his last embers, 'till the tempest swells Up the brown valley and the gloomy dells, And quenches them; whilst with a boisterous song Stern Winter sits upon his mountain.âLong Those of Love's cheerful circle, that within Their peaceful dwellings listen, when begin The storm's rude clamours, may enjoy calm rest, And he that keeps a pure heart and warm breast, Sits in the light of his own thoughts, nor heeds Darkness, nor clouds, nor how the tempest speeds!â That high Philosophy, whose wide-spread laws Govern the universe,âthat force, which draws The worlds of this vast system, led by one Mysterious attraction round their sun,â Holds its wide sway within our bosoms, where It rules the devious motion of our fair And better thoughts by strong attraction, 'till All centre towards one point.âUnchanging still, Love has its own Philosophy! H. December 1, 1824 A WINTER'S NIGHT 'T is night againâI hear the breeze Mourning round Winter's icy urn: I see the moon from the pale trees Within their sanctuary burn. Night from her golden censer throws An offering to the new-born yearâ Her light is on the virgin snows, Her musick in the winds I hear. The stars are bright.âA mist enshrouds The distant hillâbut heaven is fair, Save where the many-folded clouds Are white in the cold mountain air. There is no sound but winds.âThey stir Amid the giant company That crowds this amphitheatre.â How eloquent they are to me! Nature! thou hast grown mute to those That hear not in the wintry sky,â When the night winds harmonious closeâ The still voice of humanity! I hear itâand I see thy form Moving on Winter's silver cloud:â I hear itâand the muttering storm Reveals thee, when its winds are loud. H. January 4, 1825 [VALENTINE] Lady! if a poor child of song May ask awhile thy serious ear, And he that wooed thy love so long, Can find a willing listener here,â I have a tale to tell thee now Of blighted heart and broken vow. Aye, of a heart in bright hours cleft, As cities sacked by day are left;â A life, that wearing to a close Low in its socket starts and glows:â Of one whose love should merit thine, Dying, a slighted Valentine. Lady!âto-morrow's sun will see Life's cheerful banquet closed for me; But changing sun and shower shall long Pass o'er the voiceless child of song, Ere carved stone where he sleeps secure Shall say, âHere rests a Troubadour.â The grave!âthe grave!â'tis the last altar To which our weary feet can falter! Its fire gone outâits censer coldâ Its ashes mingling with earth's mould! Farewell!âfor me 't is sweet to die, When thine own life is blessed thereby. October 1, 1825 ON A LOCK OF HAIR As from his shrine the pilgrim brings Some relic of its holy things, That it may keep on memory's page The record of his pilgrimage.â So he who holier days remembers,â Till life is quenched in its own embers Will cherish, with religious zeal, The gift, where love has set his seal. The purple robe,âthe bright rich gem,â The sceptreâthroneâand diadem,â Yesâall life's pomp and pageantry Are but poor things for one like me:â But this sweet gift,âthis little token Of love that never will be broken, This frail memorial of bright days I'll keep till life itself decays! October 1, 1825 YOUTHFUL YEARS The following lines were written by a young man who died last summer of the dysentery. An ancient poet has said: The good die first:â But they whose hearts are dry as summer dust Burn to the socket. Next week I will send you another performance from the same pen. Yours, &amp;c A. E. I. O. U. and sometimes W. &amp; Y. Sed omnes una manet nox, Et calcanda semel via lethi.â Horace. Once more the harp, that breath'd By youth's fresh fount its numbers, When beauty's hand had wreath'd Her wild-flowers round its slumbers, After long years of pain and tears My hand from sleep hath woken,â Though it has hung so long unstrung, That Time the chords hath broken! The joys of other days,â That beauty may inherit, Ere early love decays, And youth's more buoyant spirit,â Fade, as at night the dim twilight O'er the storm-troubled ocean, Or the soft lute, whose chords would suit The songs of youth's devotion! The records Time hath made Are passionate revealings! The page that has display'd The wreck of wasted feelings!â Time cannot hide my broken pride Beneath his restless pinion, Nor hope can heal the wounds I feel From passion's dark dominion. I thought the joys of earth Would droop and wither never! That hopes of mortal birth Would live and bloom forever:â Nor wind should wake time's silent lake, When skies were fair above me, Nor hearts grow cold in the earth's mould I thought were form'd to love me. But there are griefs I knew not then,â And storms on life's dark watersâ Sorrow is for the sons of men, And weeping for earth's daughters! The cold, cold moon shall see full soon The stranger's grave so lowly, Ere yet again it wax and wane,â Silent and calm, and holy! Y. S. W. K. W. January 3, 1826</field>
