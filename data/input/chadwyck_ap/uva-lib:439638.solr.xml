      <field name="fulltext">The Verse of Royall Tyler Part I 1770â1794 FOUR YOUTHFUL VERSES Song I There was a jolly Cobler Who lived in Boston Town He work'd the Sun into the Sky And then he work'd it down. Chorus With his Bristle and his Jack His peging-awl and Strap And his lap-stone on his Knee Would sing so merily While his hammer on his Stone Went tap, tap, tap. II But he dispised the lazy great As on his bench he sat And thought his Shop a room of State When you co'd'nt swing a Cat. Chorus With his Bristle &amp;c. III One day came a pretty maid And beg'd he'd tap her shoe He brush'd his Bench sat her down Cri'd that I'll quickly do. Chorus With his Bristle &amp;c. IV The next day came the Parson His forehead grim'd with Scowls Two of a Trade can ne'er agree For they both mended Soles. Chorus With his Bristle &amp;c. Song The Merchant thus with longing eyes Looks o'er the placid glassy Main To see the whitening sails arise Which waft his Treasures home again. Mock'd by the Illusions of his Fears His terrors all the Scene deform In gentle Gale a tempest hears And Zephyrs blow a raging Storm. Song Oh like a Storke among the Rush Or Bottle hung in Chimney high Or like an Owl in Ivy Bush Yea such a doleful wretch am I But he for aye shall sit secure Forever and eke ay for Aye Also likewise he shall endure More than a whole Eternity. Song Our old Moll has got a trick Working always makes her sick Play the Jade a jigish tune And sh'll frisk round like Jumping Joan Some may boast of Beer and Wine Sling, Grog, Punch and ale so fine But to make a Cobler skip Hand a Mug of foaming Flip. A Prologue to be Spoken by Mr. Frankley To shew the vile intentions of the mind To paint the real vices of mankind To drag out crimes conceal'd in shades of night To fetch the lurking mischief to the light To shew the effects of every baleful ill By black examples drawn with wondrous skill For this the Drama first adorned the stage Checking the progress of a vicious age Here see our crimes and follies all portray'd The road to virtue joy and bliss display'd This proves the wisdom of the heavenly plan That the perverseness in the heart of man But here our authur far exceeds the rest He dwelt unnotic'd in the villian's breast There saw how treason from the infernal seed Sprung forth increas'd and ripen'd for the deed While Satan pouring in the invenom'd gall Conducted guided and assisted all Far distant since before the world began Or ever being claim'd a kindred Man Within the blest abodes of heaven above The empyreal regions of eternal love Satan that first old vile arch traitor fell And drew with him his Myriads to rebel The great Supreme in vengeance quick prepar'd A fi'ry prison treason's just reward And thunders rolling from the Almighty's throne To hells dark center drove the traitors down So Judas too when he his Lord betray'd Was sent to his own place by justice made There join'd by kindred souls with similar guilt Fell weighty vengeance for the blood they've spilt Thus Heaven and Earth were freed the traitors now Were all imprison'd in the shades below No more to rove the realms of joy and peace With war sedition slaughter and distress But see and wonder that our happy Land Where freedom arms a patriotic band Where mild and equal Laws by wisdom giv'n Form a most fair epitome of Heaven Should be defac'd by treasons noxious breath Should in its bosom keep and cherish death Transgress the first great Law make nature groan And rob Newgate and Satan of their own Ye sons of freedom rouse avert your shame Pursue the glories of your dawning fame Distinguish well your friends from artful foes These you'll reject but honour pay to those Establish firm the Fabric you've begun To last and shine as long as yonder sun Nor soner fall than when the King of Kings Brings to a final close all earthy things The Prologue Exult each patriot heart!âthis night is shewn A piece, which we may fairly call our own; Where the proud titles of âMy Lord! Your Grace!â To humble Mr. and plain Sir give place. Our Author pictures not from foreign climes The fashions, or the follies of the times; But has confin'd the subject of his work To the gay scenesâthe circles of New-York. On native themes his Muse displays her pow'rs; If ours the faults, the virtues too are ours. Why should our thoughts to distant countries roam, When each refinement may be found at home? Who travels now to ape the rich or great, To deck an equipage and roll in state; To court the graces, or to dance with ease, Or by hypocrisy to strive to please? Our free-born ancestors such arts despis'd; Genuine sincerity alone they priz'd; Their minds, with honest emulation fir'd, To solid goodânot ornamentâaspir'd; Or, if ambition rous'd a bolder flame, Stern virtue throve, where indolence was shame. But modern youths, with imitative sense, Deem taste in dress the proof of excellence; And spurn the meanness of your homespun arts, Since homespun habits would obscure their parts; Whilst all, which aims at splendour and parade, Must come from Europe, and be ready made. Strange! we should thus our native worth disclaim, And check the progress of our rising fame. Yet one, whilst imitation bears the sway, Aspires to nobler heights, and points the way. Be rous'd, my friends! his bold example view; Let your own Bards be proud to copy you! Should rigid critics reprobate our play, At least the patriotic heart will say, âGlorious our fall, since in a noble cause. The bold attempt alone demands applause.â Still may the wisdom of the Comic Muse Exalt your merits, or your faults accuse. But think not, 'tis her aim to be severe;â We all are mortals, and as mortals err. If candour pleases, we are truly blest; Vice trembles, when compell'd to stand confess'd. Let not light Censure on your faults, offend, Which aims not to expose them, but amend. Thus does our Author to your candour trust; Conscious, the free are generous, as just. The Death Song of Alknomook I The sun sets in night, and the stars shun the day; But glory remains when their lights fade away! Begin, ye tormentors! your threats are in vain, For the son of Alknomook shall never complain. II Remember the arrows he shot from his bow; Remember your chiefs by his hatchet laid low: Why so slow?âdo you wait till I shrink from the pain? Noâthe son of Alknomook will never complain. III Remember the wood where in ambush we lay; And the scalps which we bore from your nation away: Now the flame rises fast, you exult in my pain; But the son of Alknomook can never complain. IV I go to the land where my father is gone; His ghost shall rejoice in the fame of his son: Death comes like a friend, he relieves me from pain; And thy son, Oh Alknomook! has scorn'd to complain. The Origin of Evil. An Elegy Of man's first disobedience and the Fruit Of that FORBIDDEN TREE, whose mortal taste Brought death into the world, and all our woe: Sing heavenly muse! MILTON. EVA. Fructus ipse est pulcher sane visu: Nescio an sit ita dulcis gustatu; Veruntamen experiar. VAH. QUAM DULCIS EST!!! DIALOGI SACRI SABESTIANI CASTALIONIS. Lovely in death the beauteous ruin lay; And if in death still lovely, lovelier there; Far lovelier! Pity swells the tide of love, And will not the severe excuse a sigh? Scorn the proud man who is asham'd to weep. YOUNG'S NIGHT THOUGHTS. PRINTED IN THE YEAR MDCCXCIII. Proem. Ranting topers, midnight rovers, Cease to roar your fleshy lays; Melancholy, moping lovers, No more your lapsed ladies praise. Fix your thoughts on heavenly treasure, Let Virtue now with Wit combine; Purge your hearts from sensual pleasure, With Religion mix your wine. Let each lovely Miss and Madam, Quit the dear joys of carnal sense, Weep the fall of Eve and Adam, From their first state of Innocence. An ELEGY. In the first stillness of the even, When blushing day began to close, In the blissful bowers of Eden, Our chaste Grand Parents sought repose. No pair to act love's glowing passion, So fit, in these late days, are seen; Since girls' shapes are spoil'd by fashion, And man's nerves unstrung by sin. Eve, the fairest child of nature, In naked beauty stood reveal'd, Exposing every limb and feature, Save those her jetty locks conceal'd. Light and wanton curl'd her tresses Where each sprouting lock should grow, Her bosom, heaving for caresses, Seem'd blushing berries cast on snow. Adam, got by lusty nature, Form'd to delight a woman's eyes, Stood confest in manly stature, The first of men in shape and size! As Eve cast her arms so slender, His brawny chest to fondly stroke; She seem'd an ivy tendril tender Sporting round a sturdy oak. Innocent of nuptial blisses, Unknown to him the balm of life; With unmeaning, wild caresses, Adam teaz'd his virgin wife. As her arm Eve held him hard in, And toy'd him with her roving hand, In the middle of Love's Garden, She saw the Tree of Knowledge stand. Stately grew the tree forbidden, Rich curling tendrils grac'd its root; In its airy pods, half hidden, Hung the luscious, tempting fruit. With Love's coyest leer she view'd it, Then touched it with her glowing hand; Did just touch, but not renew'd it, Restrain'd by the divine command. At her guilty touch the tree seem'd Against the blue arch'd sky to knock; With nervous vigour every branch beam'd, And swell'd the sturdy solid stock. Softly sigh'd the rib-form'd beauty, âHow love does new desires produce? This pendant fruit o'ercomes my duty, I pant to suck its balmy juice. âWhy was this tall tree forbidden, So sweet and pleasant to my eyes, Food so fit for hungry women, Much desir'd to make me wise?â With sweet blandishment so civil She finger'd soft its velvet pods; âLet us now know good from evil, Dear Adam, let us be like Gods.â With burning cheeks and eyes of fire, Raving and raging for the bliss, Blushing and panting with desire, She glu'd her glowing lips to his. âThreaten'd death will soon o'ertake me, If this forbidden tree I pluck, But life itself will soon forsake me, Unless its cordial juice I suck.â Her soft hand then half embrac'd it, Her heaving breasts to his inclin'd, She op'd her coral lips to taste it, But first she peel'd its russet rind. In her lips she scarcely put it, And nibbl'd 'till its sweets she found, Then like eager glutton took it, And, gorg'd with bliss, sunk on the ground. At that hour, through all creation, Rode Love sublime in triumph then, Earth, Sea, Air, gave gratulation, And all their offspring joy'd like them. Fish that sported in the Gihon, Soaring Eagles, cooing Doves, Leopard, Panther, Wolf and Lion, Reptile and Insect joy'd their loves. Love's fierce fire seiz'd e'en the posies, Which deck'd the gay enammell'd mead, Amorous pinks and wanton roses, Dissolv'd in love, all shed their seed! Eve, transported beyond measure, Stretch'd in every vital part; Fainting with excess of pleasure, For mighty knowledge rift her heart. But when its nectar'd juice she tasted, Dissolving Eve could only sigh; âI feelâI feel, my life is wasted, This hour I eat, and now I die.â But when she saw the tree so lofty, Sapless and shrunk in size so small; Pointing she whisper'd Adam softly: âSee! there is DEATH! and there's the FALL!â FINIS. Oh Fruit divine! Sweet of thyself, but much more sweet THUS cropt. MILTON. Ode to Night Yalden's Ode to Night has been extolled with enthusiasm by Dr. Johnson. Had that acute critic perused the following, he would have fervently exclaimedâA greater than Yalden is here.âD. Hail Reverend Monarch! Hoary Night! Extend thy ever Blissful reign, Bid jarring passions cease with Light, And Peace Lead forth thy jocund Trainâ Thy Loyal Subjects here we sit Beneath they ever Blest domain In Amity and Friendship met To Celebrate thy Happy Reign. Elder than light, beneath thy sway, When thy imperial flag's unfurl'd At thy Dread MarchâLight shrinks away And owns Thee Monarch of the World. Like some vast realm whose spacious Round The monarch's Face by Turns must Bless Thy empire by Creation bound By turns Enjoys Thy Sovereign Grace. The parched Earth oppress'd, at length Pants for thy shades and by Thee blest Quaffs thy Rich Dews, renews her strength, And with the Laborer finds restâ The soaring birds, the scaly race, Reptile and insect own thy power; The beasts crouch lowâat thy approach, Bows every herb, droops every flower. At thy approach, the sons of war Unnerve the arms, bid discord cease; The clamorous mart, the noisy bar, The shrill-tongued shrew, are hushed to peace. Reclined beneath thy murky glades, Secure the secret lover plies; Shielded by thy compacted shades, The dart of scandal vainly flies. Hail reverend monarch! whilst you shed, O'er sleeping myriads ease from pain; Thy gayer mantle o'er us spread, Who wake, to celebrate thy reign. Wine, sparkling as thy starry gladeâ In every mantling cup infuse; Send friendship, strength'ning as thy shade, Converse, refreshing as thy dews. A Christmas Hymn Sung in the Episcopal Church at Claremont on the Anniversary of that Festival December 25th, 1793. 1. Hail to the joyous day, On which our Lord was born; Lift high the vocal lay, And sing the blissful morn. Your voices raise! To hail the morn On which was born The Lord of grace. 2. That sun which cheers the plains, The seasons as they move, Rich dews and fertile rains, All prove his sovereign love. Your voices raise! To Him who cheers, The fruitful years, Be grateful praise. 3. He o'er the trackless waste Our pious fathers led; And though in desert plac'd, He them with blessings fed: Your voices raise! To Him who binds The waves and winds, Be endless praise. 4. He crown'd fair freedom's cause; He made our nation great; The Leader of our wars He raised to rule our States. Your voices raise! To Him who brings To earth proud kings, Be deathless praise. 5. He taught us to discern Blest Freedom's sacred plan; And Europe's kingdoms learn Of us the rights of man. Your voices raise! To Him who broke Oppression's yoke, Be endless praise. 6. Where roam'd the savage race, In cruelty and blood, He form'd this sacred place, A temple for our God. Your voices raise, Let earth resound, The choral sound Of sovereign grace. 7. Here where the savage foes, Their deathful war-song sung, Sweet peace her olive shows, And joy on earth is sung. Your voices raise! Let all accord To praise the Lord, The Lord of grace. 8. When fell contagion cast The gale of death around, He turn'd the sickly blast, And ruddy health we found. And voices raise! To Christ the Son, Who crowns his own With length of days. 9. Has sorrow weigh'd us down, He gave, when death was near, A balm for ev'ry wound, A joy for ev'ry tear. Your voices raise! To Him who hears The wretch's prayers, Be endless praise. 10. Let solemn viols sound, And breathing flutes combine; Swell the full notes around, With grateful voices join. Your voices raise! On every wing, In transport sing The saviour's praise. Convivial Song for General Morris Talk not of your Washingtons, Hancocks and Sullivans, And all the wild crew; Our Tom set on high With his single eye Can more espy Than they can with two. Here's to eagle-eyed Gideon, Who keeps his eye steady on And is ever ready on The public amounts. And to Ira our Treasurer, Eke our land measurer, God soon send him leisure more To settle his accounts. To the brave General Enos, Who steps firm between us And cuts a great dash; To that son of Zion, Judah's young Lyon, To melt his ore iron, May he never lack cash. Now Bradley our General Who ever so well A story can tell, Our glasses must fill; He can turn black to white, And is always in the right, Be on which side he will. Here's to Morris our Brigadier, Who so kindly invites us here And gives us this treat; And to the noble Tichenor, Who has so long been wishing for And ever will be itching for The Governor's seat. A Stanza to His Wife Long be thy life!âand richly crown'd, With every blessing, earth can give!â And, when thy youthfull charms are flown, May thy endearing Virtues live! The Sensitive Plant: A Fable Mr. Dunham, The lover of Classical Poetry, who has read and relished Dr. Langhorne's âFables of Flora,â will recognize the picturesque imagery, and bold description of that inventive writer, in the following chef d'oeuvre, written by certain of our own poets. The celebrated portrait of the Druid, in Langhorne's last Fable, was never equalled, till the âCave of Chastityâ was delineated, in the following poem, by his American rival.âD. Go, ask the nymph with beauty blest, Whose heart with winning softness moves, Why coy disdain oft swells her breast, Why oft repels the suing loves? The loveliest human flower on earth Is ANNAâANNA the poet's fairest choice; Venus assisted at her birth, The Muses tuned her infant voice. Go, said the smiling queen of love, Ye graces, deck the infant fair; Paint the soft blush, the dimples move, And twine the little length of hair. Obedient to their queen's command, They scatter o'er etherial fields, Or seek what sea, or air, or land, Of beauty, or of fragrance yields. Some cull the nectarine's richest dye, Some choose the snow-drop's virgin hue, Or rob the rose'd, blushing sky, Of purest essence of the dew. Some seek Arabia's balmy sweets, To give the fragrance of her breath; Some dive for pearls old ocean's deeps To mark the whiteness of her teeth. Her eye-brow's perfect curve to prove, The rain-bow's radiant arch they try; And steal the meekness of the dove, To point the glances of her eye. A favorite few to heaven repair, Sublimer sweets in heaven to find, They cull the choicest virtues there, To form the beauties of her mind. The infant heart they form with care, To give each growing virtue room, They plant the seeds of wisdom there, But give to sweetness its full bloom. And now the busy work proceeds, They shape the waist, and smooth the tongue, Give each limb the grace it needs, And now the work is almost done. Sly Cupid viewed the busy throng, The wily urchin, bent on hurt, He looked, and longedâhe looked, and longed, To mar his beauteous mother's work. And when they blew those temperate fires, Whence the chaste virgin's virtue springs, Threw in a bunch of warm desires, And stirred them with his roseate wings. Minerva saw the spiteful deed, Indignant frowned the angry fairâ The lovely caitiff urged his speed, And sought the bosom of the air. But, Venus, know, Minerva said, My vengeance to thy rage I join, For, when you decked the cherub babe, The wisdom, and the worth were mine. Malicious Love! in vain you've fought Your noxious aims to gain secure; The deepest mischiefs, love has wrought, Sage wisdom's goddess well can cure. And seeâthe unchaste desires dispense Their venom through the infant soul; We cannot draw the infection thence, Unless we mar the beauteous whole. Lo! where yon rugged rocks uprear Their ponderous headsâenormous load! Pale, frozen Chastity is there; There makes her lonely, drear abode. O'er that cold cave eternal snows Scatter their dampening influence round, Through the thin fissures ooze, and flow, In streamlets, o'er the clammy ground. Thither the ancient maids repair, They love its cool, sequestered shade: They had a kindred coldness there, There, renew the vows they've made. Just where the cave's broad portals stand, A Wonderous plant will greet your eyes, Which, at the impassioned touch of man, Shrinks backâand in a moment dies. Yet not extinct its vital fires, Not long to death a prey remains; When the rude spoiler's hand retires, It animates to life again. Haste, hither bring the wondrous plant, I'll root it deep in ANNA'S breast; Bid it the warm desires supplant, And chide the passions into rest. This done; and straight the heavenly pair Sublimely scaled the radiant spheres, Gave ANNA to the Graces' care, Bade virtue watch her growing years. Nor think the Muse would here presume To cheat you with a poet's dream, With visions, wove in Fancy's loom, Tales, light as bubbles on the stream. Believe what friendship, love, relate; I marked, when ANNA'S teens were done; I saw the virtues on her wait, Beam from her eye, flow from her tongue. I saw the Graces round her trip, Ascend her waist, sport in her hair; The little loves played round her lip, The young desires all nestled there. Love ragedâI sought my ANNA'S bower, The heart beat high, the pulses pant, 'Twas then I owned the sovereign power, Confessed the virtues of the plant. The tender tale of love I told, Warm ANNA'S heart began to love, She blushedâthe plant that blush controlled, She shrunk the touch of youthful love. And know, each nymph, this plant is yours; Each bashful virgin feels its aid; For sage Minerva's gift secures The beauties of each virtuous maid. This plant the heart, the gardens yield. Though men have different names assigned, Called SENSITIVE, when in the field, And MODESTY, when in the mind. Anacreontic to Flip Stingo! to thy bar-room skip, Make a foaming mug of Flip; Make it our country's staple, Rum New England, Sugar Maple, Beer, that's brewed from hops and Pumpkin, Grateful to the thirsty Bumkin. Hark! I hear thy poker fizzle, And o'er the mug the liquor drizzle; All against the earthen mug, I hear the horn-spoon's cheerful dub; I see thee, STINGO, take the Flip, And sling thy cud from under lip, Then pour more rum, and, bottle stopping, Stir it again, and swear 'tis topping. Come quickly bring the humming liquor, Richer than ale of British vicar; Better than usquebaugh Hibernian, Or than Flaccus' famed Falernian; More potent, healthy, racy, frisky, Than Holland's gin, or Georgia whisky. Come, make a ring around the fire, And hand the mug unto the Squire; Here, Deacon, take the elbow chair, And Ensign, Holiday, sit there: You take the dye-tub, you the churn, And I'll the double corner turn. See the mantling liquor rise! And burn their cheeks, and close their eyes, See the sideling mug inclineâ Hear them curse their dull divine, Who, on Sunday, dared to rail, At Brewster's flip, or Downer's ale. âQuick, Stingo, fly and bring another, The Deacon here shall pay for t'other, Ensign and I the third will share, It's due on swop, for pie-bald mare. The Rural Beauty, A Village Ode Lift the window, lift it highâ Who is she that's tripping by? It is my little sprightly Sue, With pouting lips and eye so blue, Dimpled cheek and cloven chin, Taper arms, and waist so thin, O'er her neck her tresses strewn, Curl'd by nature's hand alone. It is my lovely shepherdess, I know her by her simple dress; Her raven skirt and sash of blue, Her stockings white, and coal-black shoe; Her milk-white gown, all pinn'd so fast, It seems to love the waist it clasps. Yesâ'tis sheâI know her by Her jaunty beaver, o'er her eye, While the nodding plume above; Seems to beckon me to love. Yes, I come, my tempting Sue, See she smiles to meet me too. Now my arms her waist entwine; Now her hand is lock'd in mine; Now we to the meadows stray: Plod, dull care, thy own highway! Now, eve's stillness soothes the ear, See, the half-orb'd moon appears; Now it mounts with majesty, Skirts with light the fleecy sky. Chequering all the sylvan scene; In the rivulet breaks its beam. By the mantling pool we rove; Hear the cooings of the dove; Hear, entrance'd upon the plain, The sameness of the nighthawk's strain; Now we scent the fragrant thyme, Sweet-fern and the eglantine. Then, I vow, her breath excels All the fragrance that she smells. Then, I point to Sue afar, Planet redâand twinkling star. Then we view the gemmy crowds, Now gleamânow lost in flitting clouds. Vow my Susan's eyes more bright; Than yon fairest star of night; Vow, that all their shining host Fail to count the joys I boast; Then, between each chasten'd kiss, Tell the tale of future bliss, When my Sue shall be my bride, And grace my cottage fire-side. Then I whisper wedlock joys; Future groups of girls and boys; âGirls and boys, as fair as Sue, Honest, as their father too; âHow I feel her pulses beatâ She burns me with her blushing cheek. Elegy upon a Dead Salmon For Thee no more shall water Quechee pour Her Milky Torrent o'er her Rocky Shore. Dash down the Fall or mount in Mist the Sky But Whiten into Foam to please thine Eye For Thee no more the Western Waters play Now glide in Silence or o'er pebbles stray For Thee no more the Bean like Insect skim The placid Water with his Silken Wingâ But if Thou crest the Wave with Virgin Finn &amp;câ Almoran to Eliza With a Heart of Ice The Poets, when they paint a pair Of perfect lovers, urge their care, To give them mutual charms; If dying softness seize the fair, The swain must sure, with languid air, Dissolve into her arms. Nay all, who write, and all, who read, In this one point, are still agreed, Which proves the maxim right, That real LOVE is only found, Where correspondent tastes abound, And hearts are formed alike. The man of sentiment and ease, Must choose him, if he wish to please, A sentimental wife; While airy KATE will have her beau, To trip it, âwith fantastic toe,â Adown the dance of life. ALMORAN'S heart is wrapt in flames; No blood runs riot through your veins, But all is calm and pure; Hearts opposite can ne'er be friends;â He now takes back his ownâand sends This COUNTERPART of yours. This heart, he knows, will suit your worth; He's tried the merit of them both, With calculation nice; Both, when he shivered by your side, And, when his fingers he applied, To shape the expressive ICE. Epigram My Breeches torn, my Coat threadbare, Go, court Dame Fortune's daughters fair, Says SAM, and you'll be well drest; Z?d's SAM, it is most clearly seen, That I full long have married been To that vile jade, the Eldest. The Widower Happy the man, who free as air, By nuptial ties no longer bound, With dearest wife lays every care Low under ground. While he with fops, sips tea with toasts; Airy, and gay, in his attire; Whose pride, in age, and winter's frost, Can yield him fire. Blest, who can unconcernedly find Days, hours, and years, glide soft away; Who jokes, and laughs, with vacant mind, Though hairs grow grey. No sleep by nightâdancing and drink Together mixt, sweet recreation! And making love, which witlings think Gives reputation. Thus let me live, thus dance through life, Thus, unconnected, let me die; Steal from the world, without a wife To LAUGHâor CRY! The Test of Conjugal Love Deprendi miserum est.â Hor. Sat. On his fever burnt bed, quick gasping for breath, Lay Strephon, convulsed with pain, While the wind in his throat shook the rattle of death, The hot blood rag'd through the swollen vein. Large drops of cold sweat on his forehead did stand; The lustre was dim'd in his eye; While the chill of his feet, and the chill of his hand, Pronounc'd that poor Strephon must die. His neighbours all wept, and his kindred all cried, With handkerchiefs held to each eye, While a boy and a girl sobb'd loud at his side, To think that their father must die. But who can describe the fond griefs of his wife, Her shriekings, her tears, and despair, When she vow'd that same hour should end her own life, And tore off by handfuls her hair. Oh death! thou fell monster, in anguish she rav'd, Oh spare my dear husband, Oh spare, Throw thy ice dart at me, let my husband be sav'd, Or I sink in a whirl of despair. Oh how shall I live, when my husband is dead, Or why this loath'd life should I save, Then haste, welcome death, take me in his stead, Or I'll go with my love to the grave. The wind whistl'd high, the old mansion about, And rock'd like a cradle the floor, When death in the entry stood knocking without, With his knuckle of bone on the door. And he bursted the lock, and the door open'd wide, And in the slim spectre slow strode, And he rattl'd his jaws and he rattl'd his side, As over the threshold he trod. Who's here, cried the spectre, who calls loud for me, Who wants death? the thin spectre then said; Why, who? cried the wife, why, who should it be? But the gentleman there on the bed. Occasional Prologue To The Mistake of a Night; Or, She Stoops to Conquer Written By R. Tyler, Esq. And Spoken By MASTER J. WARNER, at the Charlestown Academy On the dark margin of this dusky wood, Where lately Horror nursed her savage brood; Where the fell Mohawk bade his flames arise, And fiercely wantoned in the captive's cries: This night the rapt THALIA, pleased surveys Her callow actors' aim at comic praise. Proud Europe and still prouder Britain long Have boasted, their's the power of laugh and song: And thought the liberal arts too fine to gain A boisterous passage o'er the atlantick main. But vain their boast to hide bright freedom's light, Or check fair Science in her western flight! Fired by the pattern, our brave fathers gave, The finer arts have stemmed the atlantick wave; Beneath the foliage of your native trees, The painter, poet, actor, join to please. Then, while our pictured canvas strikes your eyes, Or our young actors bid your smiles arise, Or, when our musick wakes its sprightly powers, And leads, with harmless mirth, the laughing hours, Let candor then, imprint this thought alone, The painting, acting, musick, are our own. But, should your patronage our efforts bless, And flattering plaudits mark our wish'd success, Cheer'd by this thought our bards their theme shall raise, And native actors speak our native lays. Where our green mountains tower with verdant pride, Some future Avon shall meandering glideâ Some future Shakespeare paint the poet's dreams, Some future Garrick act the glowing scenes; Till humbled Britain, aw'd by our success, In arts and arms, our triumph shall confess. O, as our much lov'd country's fame, you prize, View our performance, with propitious eyes! And when our comic curtain we shall raise, Forbear to censure, though you cannot praise; For, when you smile, you emulation crown, But nip the bud of genius when you frown. Part II 1795â1799 The Bee An Epigram Strephon to Delia Lovely Delia, why so coy? Why, in youth, abstemious prove? Come, kiss, with me, the cup of joy, And sip the honeyed sweets of love! See, yon bee, on bud and flower, Dip his fervid sting in sweets, Or, soaring in adventurous hour, Attempt the roses of thy cheeks! Ah, luckless youth, forbear to sing; Your very metaphor's repelling, For should my Strephon dart love's sting, I fear, like bees, he'd raise a swelling. The Clown and Rose. A Fable As when gay sun beams seek the brooks, And sport upon the rising wave; So play'd the smiles in Laura's looks, In every glance, the charmer gave. When rushing winds, vindictive storms, The bottom of the brooks deface, So rage her tranquil breast deforms, So anger mars her beauteous face. Wondering shepherd! would'st thou know Why Laura different passions vex? Why now her eyes with vengeance glow, Now beam the softness of her sex? Daughter of mildness now appears, Then darts her fiery glance around, Can the same face both aspects wear, So sweetly smile so sternly frown. Why now her virgin sweets disclose, Then coyâas love and pride prevail Go to the gardenâas the rose, The rose can tell the moral tale. When boisterous Cymon sought the air, He chose the garden's walks and bowers, Some DÃ¦mon led the monster there, Sworn foe to elegance and flowers. See, as he lifts his giant stride, And hastes along the gay parterre, The conscious flowers all strive to hide, Close every leaf, and shrink with fear. Th' aspiring tulip lifts its head In vainâand scorns its kindred leaves; In vain their sweets the violets shed, In vain her sweets the jasmine breathes. The uncouth wretch's wasteful walk Scatter'd the jasmines on the ground, Broke the proud tulip's airy stalk, And trod the lovely violet down. And soon he saw the snow-white rose, Her virgin beauties lure his eye, Cease, spoiler, cease; ye fates, oppose; In his rude grasp the rose will die. At his approach trembles the flower, And paler grows her snowy form, The parent bush exerts her power, Nerves every branch, points every thorn. Cease, spoiler, cease; oh spare the meek, The rose with thee can know no rest, Thy kindred bramble, Cymon, seek, She loves the soil within thy breast. Cease, spoiler, cease; alas! too late, His ruthless hands extend and close; And seeâO bless the pitying fate! The parent bush protects her rose. Now writhes with pain the awkward hind, The starting blood his hand distains, May virtue such protection find, May cruel spoilers know such pains. With ruddy streams his fingers reek, While uncouth gestures mark his woes, Far redder glow'd his ireful cheek, When he address'd the affrighted rose. Inveterate flower, thy sweets I flee; Who seeks thy sweets thy thorns will find, False Laura's smiles I find in thee, In thee I hate her vengeful mind. The Fairest Child of June reply'd, I love the near resemblance well, I in the near connexion pride, Although her sweets my sweets excel. From the same common parent born, Into one clime we both arose, I, a fixed beauty, deck the thorn, Laura, a walking sister rose. To guard the beauties, nature gave, She all my thousand thorns prepar'd, And, Laura's lovelier charms to save, Gave Thorny Virtue for a guard. Know, Cymon, hence not dare reproach, Know hence our common danger's born, When lawless spoilers dare approach, Then Laura frowns, I point my thorns. But, should the gentle seek the shade, Sigh for my scents, and beauties bland, I'd court young Zephyr's airy aid, To bow me to the extended hand. Should some kind youth fair Laura sue, With wedlock's hand her beauties seek, Proud Laura would be gentle too, And in his bosom shed her sweets. An Occasional Address Intended to have been spoken by Colonel J. S. Tyler, at the opening of The Boston Theater, this season By a Gentleman of Vermont The comic, tragic Muse[s], in Western climes Long laugh'd at follies, or have wept at crimes; Till Europe's frantic sons, with deadlier rage Than e'er had crimson'd the theatre page, The tragic dagger seized, and madly hurl'd Its real terrors, o'er the astonish'd worldâ The affrighted muses fly, and seek our shore, Where Liberty and Commerce fled before: Where exil'd faith our pious fathers led, When from oppression's priestly scourge they fled. Long had the muses heard of our blest land, That last retreat of freedom's sacred band! That land, where genius soars sublimest heights; Where Trumbull painted, and where Trumbull writesâ Where Ramsay, Belknap, trac'd the historic line, And Sullivan defeats the force of time. Where nature's strains from rapt Philenia flow, Make anguish pleasing, and enchant with woe. âWhere hoary Franklin, midst the tempest lower, Disarm'd the forked lightning of its power: Where Warren and Montgomeryâmighty dead! Immortaliz'd those heights, on which they bled: And to the tragic muse those scenes renew'd Which erst with joy in Greece and Rome she view'd: Where Washington, immortal in fame's story! On the proud apex of our country's glory Stands like our Eagle, covering afar; Blessing those realms in peace, he sav'd in war. Raptur'd the muses heardâthen sped their flight, O'er the broad main, and landed here this night: Some transient visits these fair dames have paid But took a British gallant to their aid: But now they've come to live, like Boston ladies, To settle down for life, andâbring up babies. They've chose to make this favor'd town their home, And meâa town-born childâtheir bone of bone. This house we've hiredâthis our drawing-roomâ You'll always find new-married folks at home. Through me this eveâthe Muses each presents, But chief to you, ye fair, their compliments. To the BOXES Ye, who control those hearts whom George in vain Has fought to humble to a foreign chain: Who, crown'd with beauty, scepter'd by wit's wand, Rule, the sole despots, known in our free land: To your resistless power the muses sue;â Who shall condemn, if once approv'd by you? What, tho' in Europe's epicurian climes, They caught the tainted manners of the times, The entendre, doubly nauseous to the ear, The jest obscene, the meretricious leer; Cheer'd by your smiles, and chasten'd by your frown, Sweet decency henceforth shall be their crown; And manners catching from the climes they view, Coquettes in England, matrons be with you. No more shall bashfull beauty, aw'd by man, To the sly covert of the lattic'd fan Be forc'd, by the coarse joke, or coxcomb rude, To blushâat what, you never understood! Mirth's goblet modestly shall boldly quaff, And innocence enjoy the hearty laugh. The muses character will copy you, Be witty, cheerful, and be modest too; And this their glory, when they would excell, To mimic virtues, which you act so well. To the PIT With trembling awe, ye arbiters of wit, Ye mightly spirits of this vasty pit; Whether collected here, our ill ye bode, Or dip in printer's ink the critic probe, With trembling awe the muses wait your doom, No merit plead but that they're now your own. Tis your support alone success ensures; Yours all the merit, all the glory yours. Oh! then if politics inflame your blood, All nobly zealous for your country's good, For usâreflect how keenly e'er you feel, WIT, like true worship, knows no party zeal. Let mirth within these walls your souls employ, Like brothers worship at this shrine of joy. Let Feds and Antis to our temple come, And all unite firm Federalists in Fun; Let austere politics one hour flee, And join in free Democracy of glee! For me, sustained by youâthe task be mine, Where native genius droops in shades to find, The tender buds from wintery vales to bring, To where your bounty sheds perpetual spring. Warm'd by its rays, and nourish'd by its dew, The vigorous shall open to your view. Tir'd by the thought, I view those glorious days, When native Powells act our native lays. When bards shall carol on our river's side, And Charles shall rival British Avon's pride. Columbian Shakespeares, paint the poet's dreams, And yankee Garricks act the glowing scenes, Till vanquish'd Britain, aw'd by our success, In arts as arms our triumph shall confess. To the UPPER GALLERY Tho' last, ye harties, yet not least in love. The muses bid me greet their friends above, The author, actor, live in your applause, Tis nature's voice, tho' fashion style its noise. Unlac'd by fashion, unrestrain'd by art, Your's the warm impulse of the glowing heart. When roguish wit dismays the bashful miss, Who fears to titterâlest she laugh amiss. Tis yoursâye sons of gleeâ'tis yours to roll The laughing plaudit from the loosen'd soul. Nor less when pity strikes the chords of woe, Yours the warm thrill, which bids the tear to flow. Luff up my harties! cheer each drooping box; The good shipâTheatreâis on the stocks. Her ways are greas'dâher after blocks away, Then jump her, jump herâif you'd give her way. In me, her captainâknow me for your friend, Your townsmanâtown-bornâtown-bred, at north end! Let British lords their haughty birth declare, I boast of being born inâOld North Square. Then heave a headâdoff hatsâand now or never, Come give us three huzzasâ NORTH END FOREVER! Ode Composed for the Fourth of July Calculated for the meridian of some country towns in Massachusetts, and Rye in Newhampshire Squeak the fife, and beat the drum, INDEPENDENCE DAY has come!! Let the roasting pig be bled. Quick twist off the cockerel's head, Quickly rub the pewter platter, Heap the nutcakes fried in butter. Set the cups and beaker glass, The pumpkin and the apple sauce, Send the keg to shop for brandy; Maple sugar we have handy, Independent, staggering Dick, A noggin mix of swinging thick, Sal, put on your ruffel skirt, Jotham, get your boughten shirt, To day we dance to tiddle diddle. âHere comes Sambo with his fiddle; Sambo, take a dram of whiskey, And play up Yankee Doodle frisky. Moll, come leave your witched tricks, And let us have a reel of six. Father and Mother shall make two, Sal, Moll and I stand all a row, Sambo, play and dance with quality; This is the day of blest Equality. Father and Mother are but men, And Samboâis a Citizen, Come foot it, SalâMoll, figure in, And, mother, you dance up to him; Now saw as fast as e'er you can do, And Father, you cross o'er to Sambo. âThus we dance, and thus we play, On glorious Independent Dayâ Rub more rosin on your bow, And let us have another go. Zounds, as sure as eggs and bacon, Here's ensign Sneak and uncle Deacon, Aunt Thiah, and their Bets behind her On blundering mare, than beetle blinder. And there's the 'Squire too with his ladyâ Sal, hold the beast, I'll take the baby. Moll, bring the 'Squire our great arm chair, Good folks, we're glad to see you here. Jotham, get the great case bottle, Your teeth can pull its corn cob stopple. Ensign,âDeacon never mind; 'Squire, drink until your blind; Come, here's the Frenchâand Guillotine, And here is good 'Squire Gallatin, And here's each noisy Jacobin. Here's friend Madison so hearty, And here's confusion to the treaty. Come, one more swig to southern Demos Who represent our brother negroes. Thus we drink and dance away, This glorious INDEPENDENT DAY! Choice of a Wife Fluttering lovers, giddy boys, Sighing soft for Hymen's joys, Would you shun the tricking arts, Beauty's traps for youthful hearts, Would you treasure in a wife, Riches, which shall last through life; Would you in your choice be nice, Hear Minerva's sage advice. Be not caught with shape, nor air, Coral lips, nor flowing hair; Shape and jaunty air may cheat, Coral lips may speak deceit. Girls unmask'd would you descry, Fix your fancy on the eye; NATURE there has truth design'd, 'T is the eye, that speaks the mind. Shun the proud, disdainful eye, Frowning fancied dignity, Shun the eye with vacant glare; COLD INDIFFERENCE WINTERS THERE. Shun the eager orb of fire Gloating with impure desire; Shun the wily eye of prude, Looking coy to be pursued. From the jilting eye refrain, Glancing love, and now disdain. Fly the fierce, satiric eye, Shooting keen severity; For Nature thus, her truth design'd And made the eye proclaim the mind. The Colt A Fableâdesigned for a child of 5 years oldâ I'll tell a taleâhow Farmer John A little Roan colt bred sir Which morning, night, as well as noon He water'd and he fed sir. Says Farmer Dick, to Farmer John A'nt you a silly dolt sir, To spend such hay and care upon A little ragged colt, sir. Says Farmer John my colt will grow, Therefore I bring my Roan up, Not for the good he can do now, But will do when he's grown up. The moral you will all apply, To keep my tale from spoiling; The little colt you think is I I know it by your smiling. An Alliterative Address Fond Frederick to Fanny, False, Fair The sweetest Seraph's softest smile, The gorgeous gems of gentle grace, The slippery serpent's scathful stile Frequent false Fanny's flattering face. Headstrong with hazy halcyon hope, I follow fond the fickle fair; Nor shun the sudden, stunning stroke, Which drives me deep in dank despair. The golden glorious glowing globe, Which splendid Sol sublimely shews, Nor Night's noctural nimbose node, Distilling diuretick dews. Her eulogy can't e'en express, When cherub Cupid's cheer her charms, When bounteous beauty's bent to bless Her aw'd adorer's amorous arms. Nor systems, suns, nor sparkling stars, In confus'd Chaos countervolved, Could ape the ambling of her airs, When random ruin she resolved. Fair Fanny's fame shall flourish far, Till teazed time shall, toiling,tire; And Daphne, Delia, Dorcas dear, Shall fail to fan fierce Fancy's fire. An Ode to a Pipe of Tobacco Addressed by Della Yankee to Anna Jemima NoâNoâby thy bland self I swear, That when morn darts its infant ray, When suns regret the parting day, Thou, lenient solace of dank care, With balmy lip shalt chase despair. Friend to the friendless still are thou; While life's quick pulses warm my heart, I heave the impassion'd sigh, and vow That thou and I will never part. Sooner shall the high orb'd sun And systems into ruin runâ Sooner the source of day be hurl'd In splendid splinters o'er the world, And high wrought ruin pang each heart, Than thou, extatic tube, depart. When thy fragrance I inhale, With contemplation by my side, And innocence, to thee alliedâ How careless thou, in torpid state, Disdaining all the vulgar great, Fling'st to the raptur'd passing gale Thy purple breathâthy sweets exhale; And, in the act of bliss, Thou sigh'st away thy soul; Plodding mortals think on this, And spurn indifference to the frigid pole. Yes, Anna, by the honied lips, Whence love's bee its nectar sips; By the witchery of thy eyes, By my hot impassion'd sighs, By my heart strings' trembling chords, By my faltering, half born words, When in Fancy's magick grove Thou gav'st thyself to me and love, When love run riot in thy arms, And glutted on thy opening charms, When I quaff'd thy passion'd sighs, And drank the glances of thy eyes, When chasten'd love, with eager zest, Thy young idea first had prest, When flaming Etna burnt in thee, And all Vesuvius rag'd in me, We then had been two mated doves, Burnt offerings to the little Lovesâ But hope grew damp by Anna's art; She quench'd the fires Of young desires In vestal fountains of her heart: Yes, Anna, since that blissful time, When Mima's ermin'd charms were mine, Till that black day, when deep despair Shot terrors in the âhurtled air,â When fiend-like Fortune bid us part, And tore the life strings of my heart, Not till that hour, when mercy free, Shall give me heaven again in theeâ I've never known one mundane good But with my sweet, assuaging tube, Since thou, dear maid, art doom'd to know The luxury of parted woe; My lips shall press no other lip, Than its red, pouting, balmy tipâ If it I lose, I'll wandering go, Where Egypt's spicy rivals grow; Or if my slender tube be broke, Draw sighs, as lengthening, as its smoke. Fast bound in links of fate we'll stray, Till worlds, and stars, and suns expire In universal vortex'd fire; And ruin be the order of the day. A Reputation Vindicated A bachelor of forty five Once took it in his head to wive; As he was rich in lands and money, All long'd to catch the fusty cronyâ Old maids and misses were not idle, The one must lisp, the other bridle: Says farmer Blunt, come court our Sue, Zounds neighbor, you can't better do; What little Sue, why she's too green, The girl has not yet seen sixteen. If Sue should several years yet tarry, She then would be full young to marry; Too youngâtho' Sue's my own relation, I'll speak to clear her reputation; She's old enough to be your lady, For two years past, she had a baby! An Irregular Supplicatory Address to the American Academies of Arts and Sciences Ye learned wights, who all the heights Of science still are soaring, The comet's tail, or tail of mites Sagaciously exploring. Whose eyes, like classic bird, so round, All nature vast can inspect, Now gazing Andes lofty mound, Now peering o'er an insect. The maculÃ¦ of Sol detect, With geometric adage; And, georgically wise, correct, The fungus of a cabbage. Ye philosophic gossips, who Celestial scandals telling, Tattle what night each starry beau Will take his brilliant belle in. When hen peck'd Jove with long retreat. Flies from connubial function; Or red coat Mars sits tete a tete, With Venus in conjunction. Ye curious wights, who simpering track The tulips genial hours; Lasciviously delight to act, As pandars to the flowers. The genial natal hour, nor yet Your noblest powers arouse; But, ghastly stems noting, sit CLERKS IN DEATH'S COUNTING HOUSE. Great journalists of drizzly drops, Memorialists of air, Historians of weather cocks, Biographers of foul and fair. Inveterate foes to grubs, worms, flies, Nursing sires to weeds and swine, O hear a suppliant's earnest cries, Your laurels round his wig to twine. Oh how I yearn with you to club, At annual meetings, when so wise, You trace the lineage of a grub, Or tender loves of Hessian flies. Say! with you, shall I mount the seat, In fame's classic, georgic, charr'ot; Be wet nurse to an infant beet, Foster father to a carrot? Deign sirs to hear why now I'd reap, Agri-horti-cultural bays; And what my bold pretence to seek, To bob my name with A.A.S. I have two carrots in my ground, Each thicker than a fat man's leg; A full grown Pumpkin, ripe and sound, No bigger than a pullets egg. A peck of torpid birds I've found, Who've slept of centuries past four, So meagre, mouldy, and unsound, You'd swear they'd sleep four centuries more. Of petrifactions I have got An Indian pudding boil'd to stone; The heart of a true Sans Culotte, More petrified than barber's hone, The left eye of a non descript, Larger than the moon, when southfull, Who'd sup a Kraken at a sip, Of Morse's Mammouth make a mouthful. A rotten tooth which holds a peck, Which once crunch'd bones, or grass more pliant, Or grac'd the jaws which erst did deck, Great Magnalian Mather's giant. I keep that famous corn cob point, Which quickly can diseases heal, And coax coy pain from limb or joint, Like stroking sticks of brass and steel. In latitude just forty five, Down a dark cella[r] I did creep, And, with my union rope, did strive To measure pecks and bushels neat. Of kennel water I did weigh A poundâand thus a standard found; For, spight of dirt, dead cats, or hay, This pound will always weigh a pound. I've made a noble wriggling chair, In which my science I retail; And sit, like politician rare, And move my snout, without my tail. My darling calf now boasts in death, Seven legs, two tails uneven, Who, had he puff'd a single breath, Had frisk'd the two, and kick'd the seven. A new discovery I've wrote, Magnetic Fluid's found in flip, My feet its variations note, My head the boozy needles dip. A curious diagram I've got, All peppered o'er with A's and B's; A nostrum sure to cure the rot, In mangy sheepâin dogs the fleas. Whole years I've watch'd our parish vane, Boxing the compass, like a tar; Whole years, with hot, cold, dry and rain, Like Milton's Satan, I've waged war. I keep an obit'ary pen, Of men and old maids, through the town; When death, THAT JACK KATCH, throttles them, I mark each CLAY COLD OBIT down. If new discoveries wont prevail, Pudding, nor naturÃ¦ lusus, If torpid birds and carrots fail, Your high dubbings to produce us; My spouse, in my behalf, presents A certain Linguinary notion, Which you will own well represents, That Arcanumâperpetual motion. Address to Della Crusca Humbly attempted in the sublime style of that fashionable author O thou, who with thy blue cerulean blaze, Hast circled Europe's brow with LOVELORN praise; Whose magic pen its gelid lightning throws, Is now a sunbeam, now a fragrant rose. Child of the dappl'd spring, whose green delight, Drinks, with her snow drop lips, the dewy light. Son of the summer's bland prolific rays, Who sheds her loftiest treasures in thy lays; Who swells her golden lips to trump thy name, Which sinks to whispers, at thy azure fame. Brown autumn nurs'd thee with her dulcet dews, And lurid winter rock'd thy cradled muse. SEASONS AND SUNS, AND SPANGL'D SYSTEMS ROLL, Like atoms vast, beneath thy âcloud captâ soul. Time wings its painting flight in hurried chase, But SINKS in dew dropt languor in the IMMORTAL RACE. O THOU, whose soul the nooky Britain scorns; Whose white cliffs tremble, when thy GENIUS storms. The fallow Afric with her curl'd domains, And purpled Asia with her muslin plains, And surgy EuropeâVAINâthy soul confined Which fills all spaceâAND E'EN MATILDA'S MIND! Anna's capacious mind, which all agree, Contain'd a wilderness of words in thee. More happy thou than Macedonia's Lord, Who wept for worlds to feed his famish'd sword, Fatigu'd by attick conquests of the old, Fortune to thee a NOVEL WORLD unfolds. Come mighty conqueror, thy foes disperse; Let loose âthy epithets,â THOSE DOGS OF VERSE; Draw forth thy gorgeous sword of damask'd rhyme, And ride triumphant through Columbia's clime, Till sober lettered sense shall dying smile, Before the mighty magick of thy style. What tawny tribes in dusky forest wait, To grace the ovation of thy victor state. What ocher'd chiefs, vermillion'd by thy sword, Mark'd by thy epithets, shall own thee lord. The punick Creek, and nigrified Chactaw, The high bon'd Wabash, and bland hanging Maw; Great Little Billy, Piamingo brave, With pity's dew drops wet M'Gilvery's grave. What sonorous streams meander through thy lays, What lakes shall bless thy thick bequest of praise, Rough Hockhocking, and gentle Chicago, The twin Miamisâplacid Scioto. How will Ohio roll his lordly stream, What blue mists dance upon the liquid scene, Gods how sublime shall Della Crusca rage, When ALL NIAGARA CATARACTS THY PAGE. What arts? What arms? Unknown to thee belong? What ruddy scalps shall deck thy sanguin'd song? What fumy cal'mets scent the ambient air, What love lorn Warhoops, CAPITALS declare. Cerulean tomahawks shall grace each line, And BLUE EY'D WAMPUM glisten through thy rhyme. Rise, Della Crusca, prince of bards sublime, And pour on us whole cataracts of rhyme. SON OF THE SUN, arise, whose brighest rays All merge to tapers in thy ignite blaze. Like some colossus, stride the Atlantick o'er, A LEG OF GENIUS place on either shore, Extend thy red right arm to either world; Be the proud standard of thy style unfurl'd; Proclaim thy sounding page, from shore to shore, And swear that sense in verse, shall be no more. DELLA YANKEE. Original Epitaph on a Drunkard Pray who lies here? why don't you know, 'Tis stammering, staggering, boozy Joe; What dead at last? I thought that death Could never stop his long long breath. True, death ne'er threw his dart at him, But kill'd, like David, with a sling: Whether he's gone we do not know, With spirits above or spirits below:â But, if he former taste inherits, He's quaffing in a world of spirits. A New Song To the tune of âO dear what can the matter be.â (As sung with applause at Congress Gardens.) Come honies of Congress, pray do not be smoking me, With your well borns, and ill borns, pray do not be poking me, For what you call complaisance always is choking me; If you know me, pray how should it fail: For Och blood anouns, what can the matter be, That Congress with high blood all should full fatten'd be; O gramachree, you had better have rattan'd me; I'm bother'd from head to the tail. When first I bog trotted to Congress, dear Spaiker, I thought a Rep, like a pig, was a liberty creature, Who might nuzzle and grunt in his own pretty nature, And quarrel like felons in jail; But Och blood anouns, what can the matter be, With breeding and complaisance thus to bespatter me, And thus to be putting the gentleman after me, I'm bother'd from head to the tail. And as to this answer here to our ould President Why can't we all carry it, while we are here resident? For Fait, my politeness shall ne'er draw a precedent; To the old fowl myself will turn tail; For Och blood anouns, what can the matter be, That to bow and to scrape you will so bespatter me, And on both sides of the House thus to bother and batter me, I'm bother'd, Fait, how should I fail. With your high blood and well born, pray do no more rack us; But hear that sweet soul, honest Horace O'Flaccus, Who says that good blood will most damnably thwack us, Och honies, O how should it fail! But Och blood anouns what can the matter be, That Congress with high blood should thus all fatten'd be? O gramachree, you had better have ratten'd me; I'm bother'd from head to the tail. Here is I my nown self, who was born of my mother, A hale hearty wench, and my father's another, Whose blood ran as low as the wash of a gutter; Och honies, O how should it fail! That Och blood anouns, what can the matter be, That with your high blood you still will bespatter me; I fear my dear blarneys you are after to flatter me; I'm bother'd from head to the tail. My father ne'er hang'd a witch of a woman, Or beat a poor baiste, who made Sunday common, For why, his own self was tuck'd up at Roscommon, Och honies, O how should he fail! But Och blood anouns what can the matter be That with ould Noll Cromwell you will thus bespatter me And give me more daddies than ever went after me; I'm bother'd from head to the tail. Did you know how I fought on the sweet Onion river, It would cause all your bowels to caper and quiver, With my big wooden sword: daddy Gates was the giver, Och honies, O how should I fail; Och blood anouns, what can the matter be, That in your two ditches you will thus bespatter me, I'm sick of your nonsense and long to bescatter ye; I'm bother'd from head to the tail. Now take your fine spaiches and all go and read them; Let the house go before, maister Spaiker precede them, While I'll stay behind, like a fowl that loves freedom, Och honies, O how should I fail; Och blood anouns, what can the matter be, That with your civilities, thus you bespatter me, Fait honies, you can't to a GENTLEMAN flatter me, You are bother'd from head to the tail. Epigram Once, when a stage Jove, In a fury of vapour, Was snowing on Lear A storm of white paper; On a sudden, he stoptâ While Hodgkinson cries, Snow, honest friend, snow, More snow from the skies. The white paper's out, Cried Jove, with a frown; What, all the white out! Then, damme, snow brown. Sonnet To the INDIAN MUCKAWISS, vulgo the WHIPPOORWILL, humbly attempted in the manner of CHARLOTTE SMITH. Child of the sobre eve, whose sad delight Soothes meditation with unvaried note, Circling the earliest footsteps of the night, Whilst on the swelling wave of air you float. The musing fancy of the bard, would fain Learn the lorn numbers of thy magick spell; With thee at eve wou'd skim the dusky plain, And weary echo in her rocky cell. Ecstatick master of the tuneful art, Attune my voice to pour thy plaintive strains; While kindred sorrow swell my bursting heart, Woe's kindred notes shall sadden all the plains; For while to anguish thou attun'st thy key, My heart will chord in union with thee. Pray young Ladies, how do you fancy this Sonnet? Is it not very pretty? What a pleasing plaintive air of melancholy runs through it! You are delighted by it, I know you are. Suffer me to explain its beauties and you will be enchanted. I shall confine myself to those of the first line. Line firstââChild of the SOBER eve.â Who ever thought, except a poet, that a Whippoorwill had the eve for its mama. But why âsober eve?â Why? Because eve keeps good hours, goes to bed early, and never gets drunk. âWhose sad delight.â This is a beautiful expression and conveys a very distinct idea. Your vulgar prose people, I am sensible, speak of âDELIGHTâ as something pleasant, joyous, &amp;c. But give me âsad delightâ for my money; there is something in it so delightfully woeful that a mind of sensibility will sink into a pleasing melancholy under the operation of it. SENSIBILITY. Epigram How many drag the marriage chain, And kick, and wince, and groan with pain? Just ask the grumble tonians why Each chose his dearest by the eye. Ye fools, if you were buying houses, You'd be more cautious than in spouses; Not one of you would glance the windows, And buy with out once entering indoors; Nor yet about the doors be dodging, But try the house with one night's lodging. The house so tippy outside door, Might prove within a cursed bore; I think, says Tim, that's all I'll say, Wives might be chose in SOME SUCH WAY. The Sun and the Bats, &amp;c. A Fable 'Tis Aesop tells how certain bats, In a dark hole, like Democrats, Held a fraternal club; And chose a president and clerk, And speechified, and in the dark, Gave the fraternal hug. Cit bat, cit owl, cit mole, was there; Cit beetle join'd the circle; Cit frog, cit toad, to them repair, And cunning cit, mud turtle. Each came as he inclined to; For why? This same society Was self created, do you see, And each one might a member be, And come if he'd a mind to. And now they mingle white and black, And hug and kiss, protest and chat; Address, remonstrate, vote their whims, And scream, like noisy jacobins, 'Gainst animals of quality: They vote the eagle and the grouse, The lion bold and creeping mouse, The whale and puny water louse, Born to one blest equality. Nem con they vote, that government Should spring from them, with free consent, With all its proud projectiles; That laws and rights, and dignity, And the state's high authority, All sprung from them, the reptiles. Laws they styl'd governmental tricks, Made for mean slaves, not free born cits; And voted one and all, that they Would no such tyranny obey, As sprung from mean allegiance; And lastly, these same cunning elves, Shunning the light, purblind themselves, Voted the sun a grievance. Marching in his meridian height, Array'd in royal robes of light, Pouring through planetary scenes, Benevolence from all his beams, Dispensing heat, light, life and food, On earth, in air, and peopled flood, Gilding with joy the jocund days, Of millions sporting in his rays; The sunâwhose high good breeding shines On dunghills, and on diamond mines; On British strength and English riches; And sovereign people without breeches; On yankee fair with modest charms, And Tallien with naked arms. The sunâwho through a cranny spy'd, The little rage of demo pride, Then smil'd contempt on their ill nature, As Adams smiles with dignity, At an insulting French decree, Or blackguard piece in Bache's paper. Thus smil'd the solar president, As through the ecliptic states he went, And heard these demos hiss and croak, And saw them flutter, crawl, and vote, And yell their democratic clarion; He saw, unmov'd for oft he'd seen, Gnats, flies, and bugs buz in his beam, And oft his rays had pass'd o'er carrion. He smil'd, and thus address'd the club: âYe loathsome cits of dirt and mud, Come forth, and view my cheerful rays, If your weak eyes can bear the blaze; Come view aloft, each grov'ling soul, Where my united planets roll; Count, if you can, one single star, From nearest Mars to Herschell far; Whose light, whose heat, and influence dread, Springs not from me their federal head: Then view this joyous earth, which seems To turn rejoicing in my beams; Then view this land which gave you birth, The favourite spot of all the earth: See where the broad Atlantic laves Your shores with riches on its waves; From where the hardy sons of Maine Fish treasures from the oozy main, To the farthest verge of Federal soil, Where Georgia's wooly patriots toil: See commerce ply her feathering oars, Her broad sails whiten all your shores: See rustic life her treasure yields, See laughing labour deck your fields, While buxom health revives the plain, Flushes each cheek, swells every vein: See countless rivers roll their tides, See busy Hamlets spot their sides, Where social life lights up its fires, Religion points her holy spires; Industry takes her patient stand, And law, and peace, walk hand in hand.â Know then ye envious souls! my beams Shed all the bliss through all these scenes, I give to commerce all her gales, I raise the wind which swells her sails; I smile, and earth her treasures yields, In rich luxuriance o'er your fields; I raise the mist which feeds the stream, I deck its banks with liveliest green; I tint the buxom cheek of health, I give your country all its wealth; Should I resign my power, the world, Like France, would be in ruin hurl'd. While all the good resound my praise, And bless my power with grateful lays; Shall I, because such fools as you, A factious, purblind, dirty crew: Shall I, because you pertly sue, Destroy the good to flatter you? The only vengeance I shall take, For all your democratic prate, Is thisâwhile Bats and Demos whine I'll smile, and MORE REFULGENT SMILE. Moral. The President of the United States is advised to resign. (Bache's Aurora.) My mind is prepared, without hesitation, to lay myself under the most solemn obligations to support the government of the United States to the utmost of my power. (President's Speech.) Verses from The Algerine Captive Volume I, Chapter 2 ? The glorious Sun himself Bears on his splendid disk dark spots obscure. Who, in his bright career, denotes those stars, Or basely from his full meridian turns, And scorns his grateful salutary rays? Volume I, Chapter 4 Nor yet alone by day th' unerring hand Of Providence unseen directs man's path; But, in the boding vision of the night, By antic shapes, in gay fantastic dream, Gives dubious prospect of the coming good; Or, with fell precipice, or deep swolen flood, Dark dungeon, or vain flight from savage foe, The labouring slumberer warns of future ill. Volume I, Chapter 10 Was Milton blind, who pierc'd the gloom profound Of lowest Hades thro' seven-fold night Of shade; with shade compact, saw the arch fiend From murky caves, and fathomless abyss, Collect in close divan his fierce compeers: Or, with the mental eye, thro' awful clouds, And darkness thick, unveil'd the throne of him Whose 'vengeful thunder smote the rebel fiend? Was Sanderson, who to the seeing crowd Of wondering pupils taught, sightless himself, The wond'rous structure of the human eye? Volume I, Chapter 29 Fierce Robespierre strides o'er the crimson'd scene, And howls for lamp-posts and the guillotine; While wretched Paine, to 'scape the bloody strife, Damns his mean soul to save his meaner life. Volume II, Chapter 2 Despoiled of all the honours of the free, The beaming dignities of man eclipsed, Degraded to a beast, and basely sold In open shambles, like the stalled ox. Volume II, Chapter 9 With aspect sweet as heavenly messenger On deeds of mercy sent, a form appears: Unfading chaplets bloom upon her brow, Eternal smiles play o'er her winning face, And frequent promise opes her flattering lips. 'Tis Hope, who from the dayless dungeon Points the desponding wretch to scenes of bliss; And ever and anon she draws the veil Of blank futurity, and shows him where, Far, far beyond the oppressor's cruel grasp, His malice and his chains, he shares again The kindred mirth and feast under the roof Paternal, or beside his social fire Presses the lovely partner of his heart; While the dear pledges of their mutual love Gambol around in sportive innocence. Anon th' illusive phantom mocks his sight, And leaves the frantic wretch to die In pristine darkness, fetters, and despair! Volume II, Chapter 15 O'er trackless seas, beneath the starless sky, Or when thick clouds obscure the lamp of day, The seaman, by the faithful needle led, Dauntless pursues his devious destin'd course: Thus, on the boundless waste of ancient time, Still let the faithful pen unerring point The polar truth. Volume II, Chapter 16 Not such as erst illumin'd ancient Greeceâ Cities for arts and arms and freedom fam'dâ The den of despots and the wretch's grave. Volume II, Chapter 19 All arm'd in proof, the fierce banditti join In horrid phalanx, urg'd by hellish rage, To glut their vengeance in the blood of those That worship Him who shed his blood for all. Volume II, Chapter 20 Quaint Fashion too was there, Whose caprice trims The Indian's wampum And the crown of kings. Volume II, Chapter 21 PrÃ¦tulerim scriptor delirus inersque videri, Dum mea delectant mala me vel denique fallant. Hor. Epist. ii. Done into English Metre I'd rather wield as dull a pen As chatty B? or bungling Ben; Tedious as doctor P?nce, or rather As Samuel, Increase, Cotton M?r; And keep of truth the beaten track, And plod the old cart-rut of fact, Than write as fluent, false, and vain, As cit Genet or Tommy Paine. Volume II, Chapter 22 O prone to grovelling error, thus to quit The firm foundations of a Saviour's love, And build on stubble! Volume II, Chapter 23 See childish man, neglecting reason's law, Contend for trifles, differ for a straw. Volume II, Chapter 35 Sweeter than the harmonica or lute, Or lyre swept by the master's pliant hand, Soft as the hymn of infant seraphim, Are the young sighings of a contrite heart. Epigram on Seeing a Pair of Scales in a Lawyer's Office Lo here's the place where Law prevails Where awful Justice lifts her scales; The ancient poets all report Thus Justice did appear in court And nicely weighed in scale dependent The rights of Plaintiff and Defendent. âThe story oft I've heard,â adds Rufe, âBut never hoped to find it truth.â Says Ned: âIn ancient times the name Of Law and Justice was the same. It may be true, what they report, And Justice might preside at Court; But in these modern times when trust is Reposed in knaves (and Joe's a Justice); When Squires, for law nor honour caring, Pay off their laborers by swearing; When fines fill up his Worship's Docket And the State treasury his pocket; Now, when you see the scales, and all Suspended in his Worship's hall; It isâwe need not to be toldâ A sign that justice there is sold.â Vauxhall Gardens The Bostonians are engaged with their characteristic ardour, âfor something new,â in laying out an elegant, extensive public garden decorated with an orchestra, and rotunda, upon the model of Vauxhall Gardens, in London. We cordially wish success to this Summer seat of recreation. There, beneath the evening star, The lawyer, swelt'ring from the bar, Shall bid the thund'ring tongue to cease, And there âjoin issueâ with SWEET PEACE. While learned Doctors bless the ground, Which bids the flush of health go round; And while, all hale, their patients live, Find there that health, they cannot give. The merchants, while its walks they range, Forget the check, forget the âchangeâ; And, more their pleasures to enhance, Forget THE PIRACIES OF FRANCE. While he, who thrives on money lent, Shall find in pleasure cent per cent; Industry too shall there unbrace The arm of toil, and wash his face, And laugh, as down the walks he roves, With spousey in her Sunday clothes. There Feds shall cease to charge the Antis, With making Frenchmen rule brave yankees; And Antis cease to war with Feds, With spit, and tongs, and breaking heads. But leaving LION in his den, Shall pace the walks, LIKE GENTLEMEN. While groups of social life shall there Quaff that cool draught of evening air, Which bounteous Nature gives away, To cool the sultry heat of day. Whilst music joys the raptur'd air, And CHASTEN'D PLEASURES foots it there! We again wish the proprietors success, for however sour parsimony may âsquint askance,â we are well assured that the interest of our capitals is the advantage of the United States; and that well regulated amusement are ESSENTIAL to the prosperity of great commercial cities. The Petition of the Massachusetts Farmer's Dog to his Master And must the Law's inexorable doom Condemn to death thy fond and faithful Tray? In Life's full vigour must I find a tomb, And fall to baleful Avarice a pray? Say, must I quit for Death my darling home, Nor sleep outstretch'd before thy fire side; Nor lick the hand, which gives the savoury bone, Nor guard thee, with an honest mastiff's pride? Shall I no more thy much lov'd steps pursue; Scent, with sagacious nose, the path you ride; Then snuff the favouring gale, in chase of you, To sport and gambol at my master's side? What dreary winter nights for thee I bore, Through hail and snow, and rain, and piercing sleet; I drove the vagrant thief from off thy door, And chas'd the hungry wolf from off thy sheep. For thee I oft the wiley fox pursued, With drooping dewlaps brush'd the morning dews; How oft the burglar's blood my jaws embrued, To save thy poultry and thy tender ewes. How oft thy flocks I've driven to the pen; How oft the furious bull I've caus'd to yield; Or dragg'd the pilfering musquash from his den, Or rous'd the partridge in the stubble field. Think on thy tassell'd corn, thy fruitful vine, Thy clover fields, thy teeming garden's pride; How oft from them I drove the rooting swine, And sunk my tushes in his bristled hide. Oft did thy children sport with frolic Tray, And found in me their joy and little wealth; Whilst thou, delighted, saw our harmless play Give to thy prattlers exercise and health. Oh spare me, Master, let me life receive, Let not the dread command of death go forth; This sun we view, this common air we breathe, One common Parent gave them to us both. Man deals destruction to his fellow man, And manlike reason sanctifies the blow; But murdering harmless brutes sure never can Add one poor laurel to a human brow. Better had I with my blind brethren died; Blind to the fate, which sunk them in the wave; A strangled infant, then I had not tried The bliss of life, and found a dreaded grave. Oh leave TO SAVAGE FRANCE the gory deed; Let her the blood of innocence deface; But let soft pity by Columbia's meed, And sweet humanity crown all her race. N. B. As the Petitioner's Master was a man of humanity, and did not belong to the General Court, it is said, he pardoned Tray. To Miss Flirtilla Languish (A modern lover, if he were to paint âMaids, as they are,â would find the rosy cheek, taper waist, snowy skin and flowing tresses of the Poets so obsolete, that the Town belle would pout the lip of disgust at the verse, which, attempting to describe her perfections should pourtray a damsel of Arcadia. Here followeth a copy of verse, purchased at our Shop, by a Boston Tippy; and fabricated, according to his especial direction.) Flirtilla, the pride of the street, Oh listen to Tippy's fond lay; I swear, by my shoe bows, so neat, No beauty was ever so gay. Her pudding is puff'd to her chin, Her chignon is frizzled with taste, Milk of roses has soften'd her skin, And her neck is white over with paste. The rouge on her cheeks spreads its rose, Her braids on her neck sweetly play; No waist has my love to her clothes. And her hair is, with Marechalle, gray. With a grace my Flirtilla trips in, Her umbrella display'd to the wind, From her ruff in and out bobs her chin; And her spencer keeps bobbing behind. Of the mouse's sleek skin are her brows, And her eyes they so languish beneath; She is scented with Jonquil and rose And GREENWOOD enamel'd her teeth. I have found out a gift for my fair, To LANE'S sweet scented shop did I go, I there bought her a Tete of false hair, But she pouted at all I could do. For he ne'er could be true, she oft said, Who a present could make to his fair; Who could purchase a Tete for her head, Without any braids to the hair. To see, when my charmer trips by, Some beau point his Opera glass; How he looks down Cornhill, with a sigh, As a shopping Flirtilla doth pass. On him she may leer, if she please, Or nod as she passes the street; But let him not kiss her, or squeeze, For he'll rub the Carmine from her cheek. I'd give my Canee and Bootees, My Pantaloons, Pudding and Vest, If once my Flirtilla would please, To press me to what once was her breast. In wedlock I'd keep her from harm, No nurs'ry should spoil her soft health, Fleecy hosi'ry should keep my dear warm, If I failed for to warm her myself. A Song Suitable for the Season Bacchus, burnisher of souls, Accept a large libation; Let generous bumpers, flowing bowls Perfect us in potation. Drain the glass, the goblet drain, Drown awhile each sorrow; Tonight begone all care and pain And thinking of tomorrow. Venus, frown not, while we pour Our wine in copious measure, Each crimson drop to thee is more Than Mexic's miny treasure. Drain the glass &amp;c. The monk, who mopes in cloister'd cell, May write, and rave, and bellow; At night, with rosy, romping Nell, He's quite another fellow. Drain the glass &amp;c. The sparkling thought, the joke, the glee, Shall all our features lighten; So for my song, the burden be, Let's brighten, lads, let's brighten! Drain the glass, the goblet drain, Drown awhile each sorrow; Tonight begone all care and pain And thinking of tomorrow. On a Ruined House in a Romantic Country And this reft house is that the which he built, Lamented Jack! and here his malt is pil'd, Cautious in vain! These rats that squeak so wild, Squeak, not conscious of their father's guilt. Did ye not see her gleaming through the glade! Belike, 'twas she, the maiden all forlorn. What though she milk no cow with crumpled horn, Yet, aye, she haunts the dale where erst she stray'd; And, aye, beside her stalks her amorous knight! Still on his thighs their wonted brogues are worn, And through those brogues, still tatter'd and betorn, His hindward charms gleam an unearthly white; As when thro' broken clouds at night's high noon Peeps in fair fragments forth the full orb'd harvest moon! Sonnet to an Old Mouser Child of lubricious art! of sanguine sport! Of pangful mirth! sweet ermin'd sprite! Who lov'st, with silent, velvet step, to court The bashful bosom of the night. Whose elfin eyes can pierce night's sable gloom, And witch her fairy prey with guile, Who sports fell frolic o'er the grisly tomb, And gracest death with dimpling smile! Daughter of ireful mirth, sportive in rage, Whose joy should shine in sculptur'd base relief, Like Patience, in rapt Shakespeare's deathless page, Smiling in marble at wan grief. Oh, come and teach me all thy barb'rous joy, To sport with sorrow first, and then destroy. Spondee's Mistresses I Let Cowley, soft in am'rous verse The rovings of his love rehearse, With passion most unruly, Boast how he woo'd sweet Amoret, The sobbing Jane, and sprightly Bet, The lily fair and smart brunette, In sweet succession truly. II But list, ye lovers, and you'll swear, I rov'd with him beyond compare, And was far more unlucky. For never yet in Yankee coast Were found such girls, who so could boast, An honest lover's heart to roast, From Casco to Kentucky. III When first the girls nicknam'd me beau, And I was all for dress and show, I set me out a courting. A romping Miss, with heedless art, First caught, then almost broke, my heart, MISS CONDUCT nam'd, we soon did part, I did not like sporting. IV The next coquet, who rais'd a flame, Was far more grave, and somewhat lame, She in my heart did rankle. She conquer'd, with a sudden glance, The spiteful slut was called MISS CHANCE; I took the gypsy out to dance; She almost broke my ankle. V A thoughtless girl, just in her teens, Was the next fair, whom Love it seems Had made me prize most highly, I thought to court a lovely mate, But, how it made my heart to ache, It was that jade, the vile MISS TAKE; In troth, Love did it slyly. VI And last, MISS FORTUNE, whimpering, came, Cur'd me of Love's tormenting flame, And all my beau pretenses; In Widow's Weeds, the prude appears; See nowâshe drowns me with her tears, With bony fist, now slaps my ears, And brings me to my senses. Sonnet to the Turtle Dove Sweet CHILD OF WOE!! who pour'st thy love lorn lays On the dull ear of PENSIVE night, Who with THY sighs protract'st the pitying gale, WHICH seeks with GOS'MER wing the INFANT LIGHT. DAUGHTER OF SIGHS, whose plumy pinions wave In one dank circle of despair, WHO in the surge OF MISERY lov'st to lave, And draw'st rich solace from the realms of CARE. OFFSPRING OF GRIEF! child of EXTATIC woes! NOW night sheds soft her curtain'd sleep, AND greedy wealth, and vulgar bliss REPOSE, And only sorrow JOYS to wake and weep. COME, CHILD OF WOE, and let Eliza join In all your SORROWS, for your JOYS are MINE. The Properties of a Good Wife Proverbs, Chap. 31, 10th verse Attend ye fair, who wish to prove The richest joys of wedded love, To Israel's wisest king; And let the fairest sex prepare To hear the wisest lips declare The bliss which virtues bring. By his prophetic parent taught, The regal bard, with wisdom fraught, Pour'd forth the golden strain; While Judah's virgins on him hung, To catch the accents of his tongue, And hear their prince exclaim, âWho can a virtuous woman find, Whose beauties sparkle in her mind, In modest glory bright; Nor rubies flaming from the mine, Are priz'd so high, so brightly shine, To please the raptur'd sight. Her husband's heart shall on her rest, Her prudence makes him truly blest, She bids his fortune smile; He need not in the blood-stain'd field, The fierce banditti's sword e'er wield To gain the dang'rous spoil. Through all his pro'perous, joyous days, Her virtues shall command his praise, And, though to blame inclin'd, No action of her blameless life, Shall stain her conduct as a wife, To vex her husband's mind. She brings the fleecy treasure home, And plies the distaff and the loom, By labour gains her health Like some rich ship, the merchant's pride, Who labours thro' the distant tide, She brings her husband wealth. While night repels the grey-ey'd dawn, Before light ushers in the morn, Dull slumber she forsakes; To feed her busy household train, Prepares for them the kneaded grain, In wholesome household cakes. The sluggard's farm no increase yields, She buys his long neglected fields, And tills the barren ground; Where grew the bramble and the thorn, She bids the grass the fields adorn, And plenteous crops abound. Strength nerves her limbs with active grace, Health blushes on her ruddy face, Her tapers burn by night; Through night's lone hours, to labour prone, She views the works her hands have done, Rejoicing at the sight. She whirls the spindle with her hand, The distaff she can well command, To raise her husband's store; But when she hears the needy cry, Her hand affords a quick supply, To bless the starving poor. She dreads not winter's driving snow; Nor all the stormy winds that blow, Her household train can harm; Her wardrobe clothes can well supply, Stain'd with the scarlet's vivid dye, To keep her menials warm. Rich tapestry bedecks her limbs, Through which the golden foliage climbs, To deck her graceful form; Her robes of silk in splendour shine, Like sparkling juice of purple wine, The brilliant fair adorn. Among the honour'd and the great, Her husband takes a lordly seat, On bench of judgment rais'd; 'Midst reverend elders he is found, With honours he is always crown'd, And always known and prais'd. She shall rejoice in time to come, Honour and strength her robes become, And when she deigns to speak, Grave wisdom from her lips shall fall, The law of kindness free from gall, Her tongue shall still repeat. With prudent foresight she inspects, Her household ways, and oft corrects, With gentleness and sense; Her children rise and bless her name, Her husband shall her worth proclaim, And sound her excellence. Vain is the hope, which favour brings, From beauty no true honour springs, But piety endures; Though Israel's daughters all exceed, Yet yours is glory's brightest mead, And excellency yours. Give her the fruits her hands have done; In crowded gates, her name alone, In triumph shall be sung, Where'er her noble works are found, There shall her envy'd praise resound. From every ravish'd tongue.â The Exile Tune Gilderoy From our Caledonian Loom I Now hearsly blaws the winter's flaw, Bleak frae the gowling north, And fiercely drives the eddying snaw, Wi' dreadful tempest forth. But not the winter's angry flaw, Can rob my heart o' glee; While Bessy wha is far awa, Is faithfu' unto me. II Her linty locks adorn her pow, Like hawkies' milk her teeth, And he who pries her gratfu' mou' Sal taste the hawkies' breath. Her beauties, O, I prize them a' They fill my heart wi' glee, For Bessy who is far awa, Is faithfu' unto me. III Na mair I hear the laverocks sing, Wha joy'd my native clime; Na mair I see the gowans spring, In A' their gawdy prime. But Bessy sees and bears them a' And sae they gi' me glee, For Bessy wha is far awa, Is faithfu' unto me. IV Tho' like a plaintful ghaist I gae, In distant countries roam, Yet my sweet Bessy's heart sal be, To me a constant hame. To find that hame tho' Oceans awa O'er them in thought I flee, For Bessy wha is far awa, Is faithfu' unto me. V Tho' growsome death should close her e'en Before my love I greet, I grieve na, for in glory sheen, My Bessy I sal meet, Na sorrow sal our bliss annoy, We'll live in haly glee, And Bessy in the WORLD AWA, Sal faithfu' be to me.

Specimen of a Poetical Paraphrase of Our General's Journal In that fam'd town, which sends to Boston mart, The gliding Tom Pung, and the rattling cart; Which starves itself to wealthier palates please; With early lamb, and earliest hotspur peas; Which holds in market stalls an envied name, For butcher glory, vegetable fame. In that fam'd town, whose wealthy farmers sow A field of radish, and a grass plat now; Whose early harvest is a sieve of greens Whose latter harvest is a mess of beans; O'er whose scant farms no sturdy oxen go, But a lank plough boy tackled to a hoe. In that fam'd town, whence mother Draper rides, With panniers bounding from her mare's lank sides; Laden with birch bark boxes, berries tart, With sweet rose water, and her ketchup smart: While through the streets, the shrill tongu'd widow screams Her neck beef sausage, and her tough string beans. In that fam'd town whence comes the fattest beef, The plumpest lamb, and veal, and pig, and Heath, Our Gen'ral roseâand rose before the sun Had o'er the rocky town his race begun. For 'twas the hour when prudent farmers start From homespun bed to lade the market cartâ Around him all the youngling Heaths prepare T' obey the precepts of paternal care.â Some pick the green ear'd corn with tassled silk, Some skim the old, some water the new milk: Some with distended cheek inflate the lamb, Some with dishclout plump the kidnies cram; Some beets and turnips wash in the clean stream, Some wet long gathered peas to make them green; Last autumn's butter some work o'er anew, With juice of carrots tinge the golden hue; The rancid layers a youthful form assume, The sightly box displays the lumps of June. Our Gen'ral rose and thus addressed the drove Of youngling Heaths; sprouts of your father's love, Shoots of my glory, scions of my name, Twigs of my hope, and suckers of my Fame, Your labours quit, suspend the hucksters' art, Unhorse the panniers, and unload the cart; Let Boston bellies grumble one whole day, Whilst I the honours of your sire display; For know, if I'm denied publication, My facts must surely suffer mutilation; For why do you see, when once in print am I, I'm always sure to tell the self same lie; 'Tis for posterity I write 'tis true, But them I publish to advantage you; With flowers of Greece and Rome I'd soon be fluster'd, I love no flowers, but the flower of mustard; And that I love, because, the proverb cries, That mustard makes a very weak man wise; But tho' stern foe to royal tyrant guile I must adopt for pomp the royal style.â Know then Will Heath, our major general, Was born near Boston, and that is not all; O wonderous strange, and past profane belief, Five generations, of the name of Heath, Liv'd in one house, which stood on the same lot, And dug potatoes from the self same spot; And what's more strange our General so big, On this same spot does still potatoes dig. Cetera desunt Elegiac Ode Occasioned by the much lamented Death of His Excellency Increase Sumner Esq. Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Poets in mighty strains have told, And prais'd in high heroic lays The wond'rous deeds of Chiefs of old, And crown'd the murd'rers brows with bays. But say, in Reason's sun-shine-days, Can regal pomp, or proudest name, Command the notes of honest praise, To call the Tyrant into fame? Here, far from domes of kingly state, Or proud Oppression's lofty tow'rs, When modest Merit yields to fate, Then, Virtue, then the meed is yours. The Muse, unequal to the theme, Would call her torpid numbers forth Though small the title she can claim, SUMNER, to celebrate thy worth. Bend, O Columbians o'er the urn, Where low your much lov'd Patriot lies; Great cause a nation has to mourn, When Virtue, and a Patriot, dies! When Peace her olive branch displays, When swords to reaping hooks are turn'd, Should Worth resign to Heav'n his days, With human woe the loss is mourn'd. But when War's brazen trumpets bray, And Treason's breath inspires the blast, Such Goodness seeks its native Clay, A people, trembling, shrinks aghast! Bend, O Columbians! o'er the bier, Where such exalted Merit lies! Let ev'ry patriotic tear, Confound the weakârejoice the wife; And tell the world, Desert alone, can crave, Such grateful tribute to bedew its grave. THE FOURTH OF JULY POEMS Windsor Ode Written by R. Tyler, Esq. and sung the 4th of July, 1799 I The blushing east displays the dawn, And ushers in the glorious morn; Then hail Columbia's natal day! All hail Columbia's natal day! O! consecrate the Day to mirth, The Day which gave our nation birth; Through all Columbia's blest domain, From Georgia's shore to distant Maine, Let one vast shout of joy arise, While thus we rend the echoing skies. Shout, shout Columbia's praise, Wide through the world her glory raise, Our Independence bravely gain'd, Shall full as bravely be maintained. II When haughty Britons strove in vain To bind our land with slavery's chain, Our fathers drew their warlike swords. Our fathers drew their warlike swords. Immortal fields of Bennington, Attest the laurels which they won. Now faithless France, with impious hand, Strikes at the glory of our landâ To arms! to arms! each hardy son, And earn the fame your sires have won. Shout, shout Columbia's praise, Wide through the world her glory raise, Our Independence bravely gain'd, Shall full as bravely be maintained. III The Mohawk fierce, their fell ally, With French of deadlier cruelty, Erst drench'd our fathers' fields with blood; Erst drench'd our fathers' fields with blood; Again the bloody French prepare To whelm our land with savage war; Again they lift their Atheist rod, To blast the altars of our God: Our babes to slay, our matrons rape, And drag our sires to dreadful fate. To arms! to arms! ye Fed'ral band, Repel the monsters from our land, Our Independence bravely gain'd. Shall full as bravely be maintain'd. IV When heaven with august command, Gave independence to our land, She gave us heros to defend; She gave us heros to defend; Heros who made their country free, Who fought and bled for liberty; Nor have these patriots di'd in vain, On Bunker's heights or Ab'ram's plain. Hark! hark! the sainted heroes cry, âPrepare, like us, to bleed and die.â Shout! shout Columbia's praise, Wide through the world her glory raise, Our Independence bravely gain'd. Shall full as bravely be maintain'd. V Columbia's standard waves in air, Her active youth to arms repair, Sworn to avenge their country's wrongs; Sworn to avenge their country's wrongs; See her conq'ring Navy rides Triumphant on old Ocean's tides; See gallant Truxtun bold advance, And strike the tri-strip'd pride of France! While Commerce sounds her loud applause, To see her sons maintain her cause. Shout! shout our Armies' praise, On high our conq'ring Navy raise, Our Independence bravely gain'd. Shall full as bravely be maintain'd. VI Prepare, prepareâyour arms prepare! Blow, loudly blow, the trump of war, Resolv'd on Victory or Death; Resolv'd on Victory or Death; Great Adams guides our Council Board, Brave Washington unsheaths his sword; Patriot chiefs! who nobly brave, All our country's glory gave; See victory sublimely sheds, Again fresh laurels on their heads. Then shout Columbia's Chieftain's praise, On high great Adams' glory raise, And swear, what Washington has gain'd, By us shall bravely be maintain'd; Shout! shout Columbia's &amp;c. Walpole Ode For the 4th of July, 1799 (TuneâPresident's March) I Fav'rite Land of freedom, hail! No hostile band shall e'er prevail To blast the wreath that binds thy brow: To blast the wreath that binds thy brow: Till the tir'd Sun his course shall cease, Columbia's glories shall encrease. This day, forever, sacred be, The freeman's jovial jubilee; Our unborn sons, till time expires, Shall sing the bravery of their sires. Chorus In Freedom's praise commence the song, Celestial chorusses prolong; Till the loud strains to Heaven arise, And echoing angels quit the skies. II He Washington. comes! he comes! Columbia's pride! To men a friend, to Gods allied; In arms array'd the hero comes: In arms array'd the hero comes: While faithless France surveys her foe, She sheathes the sword, suspends the blow; Yet should her frantic folly pour Her madden'd millions to our shore, His name would strike with dread dismay These heartless insects of a day. Chorus In Freedom's praise renew, &amp;c. III At helm, in robes of state array'd, Whose verdant laurels ne'er shall fade, See ADAMS ride above the storm: See ADAMS ride above the storm: Though billows round our barque shall break, No fear his steady soul can shake. His proffer'd hand will never cease T' extend the olive branch of peace; But should a foe sound War's alarm, He'd hurl the lightning from his arm. Chorus In Freedom's praise renew, &amp;c. IV Lo! from the turrets of the skies, The patriot, with approving eyes, Beholds th' auspicious, happy morn: Beholds th' auspicious, happy morn: And, beckoning from his bright abode, Allures us up to Glory's road. Catch, then, the spirit of your sires, Nor quench the coal that Freedom fires; Till wak'd to shame, the world shall see The light that flows from Liberty. Chorus In Freedom's praise renew the song, Celestial chorusses prolong; Till the loud strains to Heaven arise, And echoing angels quit the skies. Westminister Ode For the 4th of July, 1799 (To the tune ofââCome now all ye social powers.â) Join to hail this festive morn, With joy and exultation; Type of that on which was born The Freedom of our nation. Ever shall it be renown'd In Columbian story; Happy, since 'tis doubly crown'd With Liberty and Glory. Hail again this sacred day, On which the Gods have sent us Hearts to celebrate with glee Peace and Independence. Guardian Powers! who rule above, Now descend to cheer us, And let friendship, joy and love Shed their influence near us. Heart and voice in concert join On this grand occasion, And approve, ye Powers divine, The rights of celebration. Hail again, &amp;c. Rulers still our laws shall seek To put in execution: But unpunished never break Our sacred Constitution. This our dearest pledge shall be, And on this we pride us; We are one and will be free, No faction shall divide us. Hail again, &amp;c. France her bloody flag unfurl'd Against the Crown and Crosier; Should she rule the Eastern World, The Western will oppose her. Britain too can plainly see She'll subdue us never; Thus our toast shall always be, âColumbia forever.â Hail again, &amp;c. Should either seek her Columbia. laws to whelm, We'll meet the bold pretender; ADAMS still is at the helm, And WASHINGTON defends her. Freedom yet, should England set All her fleets in motion, Will a thousand TRUXTONS get And spread them on the ocean. Hail again, &amp;c. Hear, ye Powers! our warmest prayer, May we meet your favour; Make our Country still your care, From Corruption save her. When our freedom to our sons Has by right descended, Grant their spirit be as one Ever to defend it. Hail again, &amp;c. Grant our infant happy State Still to fame be rising; And her sons be good and great, Brave and enterprising. Base deceit still may we find To their hearts a stranger; May they, casting fear behind, Brave the worst of danger. Hail again, &amp;c. Ever may the teeming ground Reward the labourer's tillage; Peace and Plenty always crown This our happy village. Industry shall be our pride, Always be respected; Idle Sloth be laid aside And Luxury neglected. Hail again, &amp;c. Grant our fair with beauty arm'd, Virtue keep before them; Then our youth, when doubly charm'd, Ever must adore them. They will bend before the throne, Where Innocence is seated; And will find by her alone All their joys completed. Hail again, &amp;c. Freedom! this thy natal day Dearly shall be rated; And among us ever may It thus be celebrated. Goodness! spread each silken wing, Gently hover o'er us; While thy sons and daughters sing This the general chorus: Hail again this sacred day, Which the Gods have sent us; Now we'll celebrate with glee Peace and Independence. Convivial Song Written by R. Tyler, Esq. and sung at Windsor, on the evening of the 4th of July (TuneââHere's to our noble selves, Boysâ) I Come fill each brimming glass, boys, Red or white has equal joys, Come fill each brimming glass, boys, And toast your country's glory; Does any here to fear incline, And o'er Columbia's danger whine, Why let him quaff this gen'rous wine, He'll tell another story. II Here's Washington, the brave, boys, Source of all Columbia's joys, Here's Washington, the brave, boys, Come rise and toast him standing: For he's the hero firm and brave, Who all our country's glory gave, And once again he shall us save, Our Armies bold commanding. III Here's to the gallant tar, boys, Whose cannon's roar our foe annoys, Here's to the gallant tar, boys, His country's cause defending; For warlike Truxtun's noble name, Like Nelson's shall extend his fame, And loud through all the earth proclaim, His glory never ending. IV Here's to our native land, boys, Land of liberty and joys, Here's to our native land, boys, Your glasses raise for drinking; And he that will not drink this toast, May he in France of freedom boast, There dangling on a lanterne post, Or in the Rhone be sinking. V Here's to our Vermont FAIR, boys, Pledges bright of Fed'ral joys, Here's to our Vermont FAIR, boys, Fill high to Love and Beauty; For while we toast their glowing charms, Their virtue ev'ry bosom warms, We'll die to guard them safe from harms, It is a Fed'ral duty. VI Here's to Vermont State, boys, And all her manly rustic joys, Here's to Vermont State, boys, Columbia's brave defender; For while our pines ascend on high, And while our Mountains mock the sky, Our Independence, Liberty, We never will surrender. VII Here's to the Sage of Quincy, boys, Legal head of all our joys, Here's to the Sage of Quincy, boys, Who guards us while we're drinking; For while we quaff the boozy wine, And sense and tipsy mirth combine, With temp'rate head he sits sublime, And for our good is thinking. VIII Now come join hand in hand, boys, Mystic type of Fed'ral joys, Now come join hand in hand, boys, Like brother, brother greeting; For while our union we pursue, 'Tis I and he, and you and you, Our pleasure all may yet renew, At our next Fed'ral meeting. Patriotic Song By R. Tyler, Esq. Sung at Windsor, 4th July 1799 I Come all ye fed'ral heroes, Who crown this festive board; Come crown your sparkling glasses, Let union be the word: And when our brimming bumpers, We quaff this merry day, We'll gayly sing, we'll gayly sing, huzza America. II Our fathers fought for freedom, Against despotic laws; Through hunger, cold and hardships, They gain'd their glorious cause: By cheerful hearts supported, They never knew dismay, But gayly sung, but gayly sung, huzza America. III They fought the British Lion, And tam'd his noble rage; And can't we their descendants A poltroon'd frog engage: We'll teach poor Monsieur Fricasee, That in the face of day, We'll bravely fight, we'll bravely fight, for fam'd America. IV Let venal French directors, Insult our native land; With insolent demeanour, A Tribute base demand: We'll teach intriguing Frenchmen, The tribute which we pay Are cannon balls, are cannon balls, from proud America. V Then rouse ye Vermont farmers, It is your country cheers; Your plough shares beat to broad swords, Your pruning hooks to spears: Nor let the land that feeds you, E'er see the fatal day, When you desert, when you desert, desert America. VI And rouse ye Windsor worthies, Protect your goodly soil; Remember Starks and Warner, And all their glorious toil: And when your country calls you, Be ready night and day, Like them to fight, like them to fight, for lov'd America. VII Your wives and sweethearts call you To guard their lovely charms; May he that wont defend them, Be banish'd from their arms: All foreign force we do disdain, But own their gentle sway, Huzza the fair, huzza the fair, of North America. VIII Great Adams rules our councils, And we obedience yield; Brave Washington shall lead us Again into the field: For when they are united, We fear no foreign sway, But boldly shout, but boldly shout, huzza America. IX Let's join our hands together, In token of our love; In one firm band of union, Recorded now above: And as a band of patriots, We swear this sacred day, That we'll defend, that we'll defend, defend America. Part III 1800â1807 Ode Let praise, the victor's act record And nations deify the sword With human sacrifice impure; To such, when fate has given the blow, The service of external woe. Shall long prescriptive right secure: But ah! the tears, the sighs, that part Spontaneous from the deep-charg'd heart, The formal summons disobey; This envied meed from distant lands, The name of Leopold commands, And every friend of man shall pay. Lamented youth! I never trod The banks where rapid Oder flow'd, Whose latest sons shall weep thy doom; Nor ever hail'd thy gracious form, Whose promis'd worth, th' unkind storm Hath crush'd in manhood's opening bloom. Yet all confess'd, to Fancy's eyes, Thy gentle spirit seems to rise With amaranthine splendor crown'd; And recent, from their wat'ry grave, The tender group thou died'st to save, On snowy pinions hover round. Tho' now, to better worlds resign'd, Thy bright example, left behind, Shall still, to man, extend thy care; Disclose the surer paths of fame; And nobly point the social aim, âTo save, to pity, and to spare.â An Elegy on the Death of Romeo, A Lady's Lap-Dog If, when the stern unpitying hand of fate, Hath snatch'd some beau, in pulville's fragrant bloom, Clos'd the dear parrot's demi-human prate, Or with some much-loved monkey swell'd the tomb; If when these fav'rites of the female race, Forsake their fond caresses, cares and smiles, And transmigrated thro' unbounded space, Promiscuous chat, and fawn in various stiles; If these command the unavailing tear, Inspire the breast, which tasty griefs pervade, The lilly wringing hand, the sigh sincere And all the pomp of sorrow's dun parade, How must fair Delia's pensive bosom glow, How woe, triumphant, swell her lovely eyes, At thy sad death, sweet, gentle, Romeo, Now fled from earth to puppify the skies! Oh! say, ye human Lap-dogs, ye can tell, Who, thro' the city swarm with well-dress'd pate, Appendages of many a flaunting Belle, Are not such pullies fashionably great? Who then, more justly claims the female tear, Among the semi-quadrupedal throng, Than Romeo,âcoal black Romeo, sadly dear, The theme elegiac, of this funeral song. What tho's no tallow'd toupee, powder'd o'er, The Gallic Friseur's labour e'er encreas'd; Nor tail, but nat'ral, dangled to the floor, T' adorn the person of this pretty beast. Who tho' no Hessian hat's capacious brim Conceal'd the living wonders of his head, Nor o'er his features, regular and trim, Were Magazines from beauteous snuff-box spread; What tho' no taylor's new creative power, (Whose cross-leg'd fiat, doth whole hosts compose) E'er bade him strut, the fopling of an hour, To charm the sex, like modern mushroom beaux. Yet had sleek Romeo jetty, shining hair, By nature dress'dâbesides a native queue, Which dangled after Romeo, every where, As two-legg'd puppies after ladies do. And if no new cock'd-hat, in style immense, Conceal'd the exterior beauties of his pate, Sure this display'd a modern coxcomb's sense, Two lengthen'd ears, and a long tongue to prate. Erst in a sable full-dress was he clad, Like the grave doctor, counsellor divine, And own'd, combin'd, what few of those e'er had, The talents and the clothes to make him shine. Nor these alone,âthe accomplish'd Romeo knew The novel tone of language and address; Obsequious fawn'd, was learn'd, and witty too As half his species, whom the town caress. His gentle wooings, many a female pup, On carpet Turkish, or soft damask bed; Now weeping owns; while fancy conjures up The tale be told, the tender tears be shed. But ah! he's goneâjust like his name-sake Ro, A fatal Juliet with her canine priest, Entic'd him, am'rous, thro' the frost, and snow, Till Death's maw took, keen-gorg'd, the puppy-feast. Loud weep, ye lap-dogs, for your hero dead, And oh! ye female pups the howl return! And where yon hallow'd turf sustains his head, Copious bedew the consecrated urn. Ejaculatory Sonnet Thy judgements God, are holy, right, and just, Tho' evils press, and tho' we sink to dust; Tho' darkness shroud thy throne, and clouds thy face, I cleave to thee and hope thy pardoning grace. Firm is thy truth, thy promise ever sure, And Jesus' blood my safety will procure; Thy mercy beams with full resplendent ray, And opes the portals of eternal day. Before thy throne I bow beneath thy rod, And own the arm and angry frown of God; Thy hand I feel nor dare thy dreadful power, Support me, God, in this tremendous hour. What e'er my doom, what e'er my state shall be, O grant me still to put my trust in thee. Lines to Her, Who will Best Understand Them When first I met your sparkling eyes, And felt their beams inflame my heart, Anticipating future sighs, Cold Caution urged me to depart. But ardent Love, presumptuous boy, With Hope's gay visions cheer'd my soul, And whisper'd âLaura may be coy, And force the love-sick tear to roll; Yet soon, disdaining coquet wiles, Consent the charmer's tongue shall speak, And, with the sunshine of her smiles, Dry every tear that stains thy cheek.â Lines on Brattleboro There is a wild sweet valley, hid among the mountains blue, And fairer, brighter vales methinks are âfar between and few.â 'Tis cradled in the granite arms, and 'neath the Sky serene Of all New England's lovely spots, the loveliest, I ween. When morning looks with dewy gaze from o'er Monadnock's crest On foliage, flowers, and fields beneath, and hills pil'd in the west, And gleams on Whetstone's silver brook, now lost, now seen again, Soft murmuring as it winds adown this wild green Mountain glen, Or when Eve's stellar lamps burn bright in heaven's star-flowered field O'er Hill and Tree and River dark at the base of Chesterfield, Oh! then is wrapt in beauty rare, the sylvan mountain scene The spot of all the Pilgrims' land, where Beauty's home hath been. Oh! if fond nature ever wakes the spirit's thrill of bliss, And stirs within the heart, a thought of gushing happiness, 'Tis when she groups with wayward hand the woodland hill and dale A scene so true, yet romance like, as Brattleboro Vale. Stanzas Written by Moonlight The full orb'd moon o'er the blue arch of heaven Serenely sails; Breathes through the whispering groves the breath of even, In cooling gales. As on the planetary worlds I gaze, Which gild the pole, Scenes of past times, and deeds of other days Steal o'er my soul. England's white cliffs in fancy's visions shine, Beetling the main, Where my young muse, at Nature's lovely shrine, Pour'd her first strain. Ah! scenes belov'd, which from my pensive breast Force the warm sigh. When shall I from my weary wanderings rest Beneath your sky? Oh! when shall I retrace my native plain And favourite grove? When shall my throbbing bosom greet again The friends I love? Fair is Columbia's land, where Nature pours Her richest stores; Fair as the laughing vales and genial bowers On Albion's shores; Yet Fancy ever loves the spot to trace, With fond delight. When wing'd with rapture, life's young moments flew, Unstain'd and bright. Where many a warm affection round the heart Entwin'd its chain. Kind friendship, candid pity's generous part, And love's sweet pain. ... Shine, then, thou full orb'd moon, and breathe, soft gale Among the grove; And as I wander o'er the silvery vale, In pensive musings oft shall memory hail The distant scenes, and absent friends I love. Hymn to the Supreme Being Written for the use of worshipping assemblies, on the day of the approaching general fast. Father Supreme! Eternal God! We bow before thy throne; Spare the just vengeance of thy rod, While we our guilt bemoan. From early youth to riper age Thy perfect word we saw; But yet through each successive stage We spurn'd thy holy law. Guilt, like a fev'rish fest'ring wound, Has rankled all within; From head to feet pollution's found All leperous with sin. Dare we approach thy holy place? God! spotless and serene! Before whose sight the heavens are base, And angels are unclean. How shall we dare our God assail? With prayer before him come; When seraphims their faces veil, And cherubims are dumb. Clouds and thick darkness, flaming fires, With terror mark his ways; His mighty cherubs strike their lyres, And thunder forth his praise. He rideth on the stormy wind, His flaming spirits nigh; The lightning loiters far behind, When, at his word, they fly. With trembling awe! far off we stand, And offer our requests; And cry for mercy at thy hand, And smite our guilty breasts. PAUSE The author was unwilling to break the integrity of the subject by dividing this Hymn; but as it is conceived to be too lengthy to sing unless at the conclusion of public worship, this pause is inserted to point a proper division, if necessary. [Original footnote.] O GOD OF TRUTH! shall man essay To sing thy spotless praise? Whose erring feet so often stray In falsehood's devious maze. O GOD, MOST JUST! shall lips impure Within thy presence be? Or shall those hands which gripe the poor, Be rais'd in prayer to thee? OMNISCIENT GOD! who form'd the heart, And know'st our inmost will; Shall men from thy just laws depart, And dare thy presence still? ALL PRESENT GOD! where shall we flee From thy all-searching eye? To earth's remotest bounds shall we, On wings of morning fly? ALL PRESENT GOD! tho' worms of dust We seek thy sovereign grace; Nor yet on rocks and mountains trust To hide us from thy face. Though solid rock or mountains, brings No shelter safe from thee; Though on the morning's rapid wings In vain thy sight we flee. Yet, GOD OF MERCY! yet we move To thee our hopeful prayer; For thy broad shield of boundless love Can screen us from despair. Great Source of Love, in thee we trust, A nation's voice we raise; With rending hearts and mouths in dust We fast and pray and praise! Blot out our sins, our guilt remove; Or if a rankling sin appears, With eyes of pity, God of Love, O view it only through our tears. In vain we fly to realms afar Or sink to worlds below Still our offended God is there And every thought will know. O God of Mercy! on this day Our Sins forgiveâdispel our fears And if thou viewest our SinsâWe pray Behold them only through our tears. Obituary He comes! the awful King of terror comes! Before him stalks devouring pestilence; And in his dreadful train, consumption, Fever, appoplex, in horrid phalanx march To war with man. Underhill's Poems. A Riddle For the Ladies I never was, nor yet I am; I never spake, and yet I talk; I ne'er was born, yet I must die; I've active feet, yet I ne'er walk. No body, voice, or shape I claim; No hands or even legs to help me, And yet when you have found my name, You'll own you've often seen, heard, felt me. Are you a maiden prim and shy, And at some youngster set your cap, When your sweet Strephon passed by You saw me near his jetty hat? Perhaps a buxom widow may Yearn to know my deep hid name; What she weeps for let her sayâ What she smiles at, I'm the same. If a fond wife you chance to be, You can fully solve me, madam; In extremes I'm known to thee; Sometimes I'm merry, sometimes sad am. Romping girls and prudish misses, Matrons grave and Elders show me; Squires, Captains share my blisses, But old Bachelors can't know me. I cough, I weep, I laugh, I sneeze, I hear, I see, I smile, I frown, I drown, I burn, I melt, I freeze, And am the joke of all the town: And yet no features mark my face, No passions in my heart you'll find, No feelings in my limbs you'll trace, And I am wiser than mankind. Then guess me out and tell my name, Tho none have I, and what is stranger? While you have guess'd, &amp; guess'd in vain, You've mention'd me, and there's my danger. Old Simon A SONG Tuneâin a Mouldering Cave S. In his crazy arm chair, on the downhill of life, Old Simon, sat calm and resign'd; He had outliv'd his friends, he had buried his wife, Old Simon was lame, deaf and blind. But the Being of Love! who still tempers the blast With devotion had sweet'ned his mind; Her gay smiles, o'er his wrinkles, contentment had cast, And cheer'd him tho' lame, deaf and blind. His misfortunes, his woes, could you hear him relate; Insisting, they all were design'd To reclaim him from ill, or some bliss to create, You'd long to be lame, deaf and blind. When I learn, says Old Simon, that topics of State, Inflame each political chief; That they back-bite, snarl, slander, in noisy debate; Old Simon's content to be deaf. When Fashion, that tempter, than the serpent more sly, To folly, Eve's daughters inclin'd; When with scarce a fig-leaf, they obtrude on the eye; Old Simon's content to be blind. When battles' fell trumpets so frequently sound And blood marks our annals with shame, When abroad, war and murder, are raging around; At home, I'm content to be lame. Thus, this worthy old man, by contentment and pray'r, To the ills of his life was resign'd; And in death, he exclaim'd, as he sunk in his chair, What bliss, to the lame, deaf and blind. With chaplets of joy in regions above, His temples the angles entwin'd, Old Simon there blesses the Being of Love, Who here made him lame, deaf and blind. Love and Liberty By R. Tyler, Esq. I In bri'ry dell, or thicket brown, On mountain high, in lowly vale, Or where the thistle sheds its down, And sweetfern scents the passing galeâ There hop the birds from bush to tree, Love fills their throats, Love swells their notes, Their song is Love and Liberty. II No parent bird shall love direct: Each fair he seeks in plumy throng, Caught by the lustre of her neck, Or kindred softness of her song. They sing and bill from bush to tree, Love fills their throats, Love swells their notes, Their song is Love and Liberty. III Some airy songster's feather'd shape, O! could my love and I assume; The ringdove's glossy neck he take, And I the modest turtle's plume. O! then we'd sport from bush to tree, Love fill our throats, Love swell our notes, Our song be Love and Liberty. Ode to the Humming-Bird Thou insect bird! thou plumed bee! The muse attunes her lay to thee, Of all that spread the tiny wing, And float upon the gales of spring, None boast so fine a form as thine, No flower has hues that can out-shine The crimson down thy neck that rings, The verdant gold that tints thy wings; To leave the leaf by zephyr borne, And rove the roscid meads at morn, Or down the garden's alleys wing, And seem the fairy power of spring, That views her buds with anxious care And fans them with her softest air. Such is the life decreed to thee, So blissful do thy moments flee; And when thy darling flowers at last Fade and die by winter's blast, Thou fliest where happy instinct leads, And sport'st with spring on other meads. A Bashful Lover Away the changing seasons roll, Louisa still has all my soul, And still in torturing doubt I rove; And dare not know if fortune frown, Or if the bliss be mine to own Louisa's love. When, as the airy dance we twine, Her rosy fingers mix with mine, A wild emotion thrills my frame But oh what transports fill my mind, When by her trembling touch I find She feels the same. To banquet on her heavenly bloom With steadfast gaze, I ne'er presume, But fearful steal a side-long view, And oft, o'erwhelm'd with glad surprise, Bent on my face, I meet her eyes Of liquid blue. Confus'd we quickly look away, And seem with careless thoughts to stray, But strive to rule our eyes in vain; The truants ever turn askance, Until with sudden, timid glance, They meet again. Oh, to the winds thy sorrows give, No more in doubt, Rosario, live, But trust who sweetly whispers thee; 'Thou sighest for Louisa's arms, As soft a wish her bosom warms, 'Tis sympathy. The Scandinavian Hero Skogul From midst the dusty fields of war, To realms beyond the northern star, To loud Valhalla's echoing halls, I bear the hero ere he falls; The valiant dwell in these abodes, And sit amid the carousing gods; Not goblets rich, nor flasks of gold, But skulls of mantling mead they hold; The coward while he gasps for breath; Sinks darkling to Hela beneath. Harold O be it mine, from conflict borne, To reach the realms of endless morn; At Odin's board my lips I'll lave In the foam'd bev'rage of the brave. Odin Who breaks the dusty fields of war, Death travels by his clattering car; Perch'd on the whirlwind's thund'ring tower, On come the sable tempest's power; Ye warriors rise, ye chiefs give room, A godlike guest in youthful bloom, Harold from fields of battle see, Begin th' immortal revelry. Versification of a Passage from Ossian The northern blasts thy cloudy gates unfold, Thy warlike form, O Fingal, I behold; Amid the curling glooms that wrap thee round, Appear thy gleaming arms in fight renown'd; Thin as the clouds the weeping stars that lave, Thou art no more the terror of the brave. Thy pound'rous shield, in battle once so bright, Seems like the waning empress of the night; A feeble vapour is the sword you bore, Dim is the chief who walk'd in light before. Yet still thy steps are on the distant winds, And thy strong grasp the brewing tempest binds, The sun thou takest in thy dreadful ire, And quenchest in the clouds his blazing fire, The sons of little men affrighted fly, A thousand showers pour from out the sky; But when thou comest forth in calmness sweet, The gales of morning play around thy feet; The sun shines out upon the dewy meads, And through the vale the winding river speeds, The bushes shake their green heads in the breeze, The roe toward the distant desert flies. Versification of a Dialogue from Ossian Ryno The storms are hush'd, the pelting showers pass, Serene and tranquil is the noon of day; The sun gleams fitful o'er the waving grass, And through the vale the red stream works its way. O stream! thy sound is music to mine ear, But sweeter is the voice that sounds afar; It is the voice of Alpin that I hear, He mourns the valiant who have fall'n in war. Why dost thou weep, O Alpin, son of song? Why thus thy melancholy music pour, Like the cold blast that sighs the woods along, Or sullen waves that tumble on the shore? Alpin My tears, O Ryno, for the brave are shed; Though tall among the sons of men you move, Yet must you slumber with the silent dead, Forgotten on the hills you lov'd to rove. To Miss B???????s Think not, fair lady, that I fly To shun a face so dear:â O I could sit, and look, and sigh; But 'tis thy frown I fear. Sweet is that throb, which swells the breast, When Love and Hope are there; But Love, without that angel-guest, Is anguish and despair. And would it not in me be vain, To hope for such a prize? To think that I, of all my train, Alone, should please thine eyes? Ah yes, it would!âthen let me fly From joys that cost so dear:â Though I could sit, and look, and sigh, Yet 'tis thy frown I fear. Extract from âThe Divine,â A Poem in Six Books Pride of his flock, and pride of all the good, See BUCKMINISTER, in early youth, adorn The sacred desk. And while an idiot lure Tempts many a young associate to avoid The sainted path of wisdom, and to seek A worthless good in Pleasure's syren wilds, Or with base ardour toil for worldly gain, Or climb the cragy cliffs of earthly power; Be his the higher aim to nobly shine The young Josias of a christian age; And, by a bright example, hasten on The promised era and the glorious reign Of him, who has ordain'd from infant lips Of babes and sucklings his perfected praise. With polish'd periods, grac'd with all the aid Of ancient lore and chastest modern style; And, what's more priz'd, with apt quotation grac'd, From the rich pages of the inspired pen, Which mock all human rhetorick to scorn, The classick christian breathes the chaste discourse; With temperate zeal the wandering sinner warns; Sustains the pious with the promise'd grace; Confirms the doubting; awakens the secure; With mild counseling voice the wretched cheers; And, with the purest elegance of speech, Gives new attraction to the gospel truth. By Science Aided ... By science aided, BRYAN'S pen displayed To my astonish'd view those wondrous scenes; Innumerous suns, in living pomp arrayed, And worlds rejoicing in their genial beams. One powerful law through all extends its force, Bids in fix'd path the unwieldly planet roll, Restrains the fiery comet in its course, And in bright order forms th' harmonious whole. Even in the moral world its power we owe, When souls meet souls in kindred taste allied; Congenial hearts, congenial genius known, In vain attraction's power we strive to hide. The Mechanick Preferred One day lively Sue, at a female tea-drinking, Says, Come tell me girls, for I have been thinking, If we all had our choice to be married tomorrow, What business in life our husbands should follow? Why, I'd have a Doctor, says Sally the witty; And I'd have a Lawyer, says Sophy the pretty; Says Nancy the sober, from both these I pass on, Give me for my husband, the lovely young parson. I am not so high-minded, says sly little Mary, As to raise my ambition to men literary; Those wise learned husbands to you I resign, But give me, O give me, a COOPER for mine. Epilogue to the Theatrical Season: Or, A Review of the Thespian Corps Tu, quid ego et populus mecum desiderat, audi. Hor. Ar. Poet. The season's clos'd, the benefits are o'er, And heroes, heroines, strut the stage no more: Kings, clowns, lords, lovers, virgins, matrons, queens, No more adorn, no more disgrace the scenes. Swords, foils, hats, helmets, sceptre, crown, and globe, Are stuff'd promiscuous, in the old wardrobe, Where tragick buskins, comick socks are pack'd, Or sent to KENNY to be soal'd or tapp'd. Theatrick lords, whose pride no power could stem, Are dwindled down to very common men; And royal dames, who erst the pit could charm, Now wash old laces, or old stockings darn. Great Ataliba, CHILD OF THE BRIGHT SUN, Is now poor simple Mr. Dickenson: Proud Alexander, who the world o'erran, Is T. A. Cooper, a mere gentleman: USHER no more harrangues Rome's rascal many, And gracious Duncan isâungracious Kenney. The rival queens, who nobly daring, tried To conquer him who conquer'd all beside, Now cease to rage; hush'd is the tragick strife, Lost in the matron and the duteous wife. But the stage virtues still in some are seen; What charm'd the publick charms the private scene. A Belvidera still in POWELL see; Enchanting Hester, DARLEY, lives in thee:â The tripping DARBY still the air may saw; Great Sysigambis is great Mrs. Shaw. The season's clos'd, the benefits are done, And all the players' occupations gone: Gone are the comick grin, the tragick rage; E'en native HASSAM'S fled the lonely stage: The curtain's dropp'dâand now, to be in vogue, All that remains is this sweet epilogue. Come then, my Muse, the Thespian corps review; Come, give to merit praises justly due; Come, let no worth escape thy peering eyes, Though hid amidst a thousand faults it lies; For who's so mean, in nothing to excel, When even MILBOURNE shines in Bagatelle! Come then, my Muse, thou meek-eyed, dove-tongued maid, Come, call thy sister Candour to thy aid, And, as I bid the rouge-cheek'd corps pass by, Come, note their merits with thy critick eye; Each fault correct, with thy sweet smiling frown, And grace the worthiest with thy laurel crown. See, at my call the motley train advance, Some walk, some limp, some fidget, and some dance, Some fence, some sing, some laugh, some deeply sigh, Some grin, some chatter, and some bleed and die. All show their powers in all their various ways, To gain thy favour and secure thy bays. Pray who is she that's foremost in the race, With clear starch'd elbows stiffen'd into grace, Whose comely form between her arms appears Like a young rose-tree, propp'd by espaliers? Is this Malvina, Oscar's graceful fair? Sure Ossian's heroes had a taste most rare! But lo! what majesty of flesh appears! What rippling gutturals grate our ravish'd ears! The solid loves on thy plump person wait, Great ton of beauty, graceful by gross weight. O had old Falstaff had of thee a view, He'd quit mine Hostess and Doll Tearsheet too. Squab dove of love! thine is the comick mien To strike broad humour from the saddest scene. See thy own AgathaâOh, hear her groan, âConsumptive sufferer, worn to skin and bone;â While moping melancholy grins with glee, To hear her hectick groans and look at thee. Now speak, my Muse, resolve me, if you can, Is this an actorâor a clock work man? With measur'd step he paces o'er the stage, Looks grave by rule, and even smiles by gage. Say, it is Nature moves the buckram fop? Sure 'tis the nature of a barber's blockâ A mere automatonâa walking staffâ A pasteboard actor, with a wooden laugh. In some museum quickly see him plac'd, With straw-stuff'd apes and petrifactions grac'd, Where BOWEN'S bees-wax beaux will joy to see That they excel him in vivacity. The bounding time see agile DARBY beat, And shame the musick with her fairy feet; In rustick hop, in courtly saraband, In varying hornpipe, or in ballet grand, Still, still she charms, and still our hearts shall warm, While graceful movements have the power to charm. But, not content to dance into our hearts, The dancing DARBY dances all her parts: Should faithful love her suitor's bosom wring, DARBY returns it with a pigeon wing; Chassees a fit, and rigadoons a swoon, And promenades it to a lover's tomb. From that base throng, who ply beneath the stage, The refuse of the play-house and the age; From that base throng, who wait upon their betters, Who murder murderers and carry letters; From that base throng, who in lac'd liveries shine, Or spoil the parts of beasts in pantomine, Shift scenes, light lamps, and swell a prince's train, Or in some doughty battle, act men slain; From that base throng, my Muse, there's one steps forth, And claims the laurel due to his known worth. Pray who art thou, that dares the laurel claim? State thy pretensions, and declare thy name. â'Tis modest worth commands the impartial Museââ Stayânow I know thee by thy yellow shoes! Whether thou murder'd Banquo in dark hour, Or kill'd the royal infants in the tower; Whether upon the stage I saw thee go, Or, condescending, snuff the lamps below; Where'er thou went, thy merits were not hid, Still, still I knew thee by thy yellow kid. Then hear, great ruffian, hear the Muse proclaim The gory honours of thy bloody fameâ MORGAN'S all perfectâthus proclaims the Muse; A perfect ruffian, allâexcept his shoes. Hark, hark! what strains upon the breezes float! The wild winds pause to catch each fleeting note. To DARLEY, sure, those potent strains belong, That mighty master of the powers of the song: Manly, though soft; mellifluous, though clear; Correct, yet wild, he charms the enchanted ear. âLet Fame sound the trumpet,â and Candour proclaim, That DARLEY'S unrivall'd in song-singing fame. The favour'd lover pleasing DARLEY plays In style as happy as his favourite lays, 'Tis false ambition thy desire awaits, To copy COOPER or to mimick TWAITS; Believe me, DARLEY, that I tell you true, To sing and love is all that you can do. But zounds! what different sounds confound the ear! Is this indeed a human voice I hear? Or rusty hinge or some old creeking gate? Or some knife scratching on an earthen plate? Or Indian pappoose yell? or scolding squaw? Or smoking Dutchman, whetting cross-cut saw? Or those fam'd mousers, twin-tied by the tail, Which show'd where BILLINGS' musick was for sale? Is this the voice of that stout man of size? Lend me thy handkerchief to rub my eyes. I beg thy pardon, Muse, I had forgot itâ You're in the fashion, girl, and have no pocket. Is this the voice of that stout reverend youth? It seems the echo of his hollow tooth. O KENNY, KENNY! didst thou know thy powers, Thou'dst rival GARRICK on this stage of ours: Play apparitions, witches, spectres, ghosts, Hobgoblins, furies, and enchanted posts, Whose dismal screams and horrid shrieks foretel[l] The deadly voices come from lowest hell: Here you must shine, since 'tis by all confest, Who speaks most horrid's sure to speak the best. Te heâha haâoh lookâha haâO see That soul of humour and that life of glee! I die with laughterâall my strength subsidesâ Oh hold meâhold meâI shall split my sides. Come forward, TWAITSâthou drollest child of fun; Thy looks are jokes, thy very steps a pun. Come forward TWAITS, I know thee for the same, Droll as thy phiz, and funny as thy name. Let others mouth the ponderous tragick page, With blood and carnage smear the frighted stage; By deep distress the moral lesson scan, And teach us virtue from the woes of man: Thou grotesque child of whim, still be it thine With âquips and cranks and wanton wilesâ to shine; With squint-eyed satire, a bad age reclaim, And vice and folly laugh to open shame. Come, come, sweet Muse, give TWAITS thy laurel crownâ But whence thy pretty, prudish, sugar'd frown? âThe sacred laurel must not be debas'd, âNor on a zany actor's noodle plac'd.â But yet, sweet Muse, in Caleb Quotem's wig, For love of funâO stick one little sprig! Ha! who comes now, to vex the scar'd beholder, With mouth, like French horn, sounding o'er one shoulder! Commodious splay mouth, surely well applied To speakâin play-book phraseâa speech (asides); What wry renown would to thee, USHER, cling, âThe little farthing rush-lightâ wouldst thou sing. But see, two females every grace impart, The fair associates of the scenick art; Pride of the stage and pride of private life, Whether beheld as actress, mother, wife. 'Tis not the thundering clap, the gallery's roar, The cheering whistle, or the loud encore, Which crown the actress with a favourite's name; 'Tis private virtue gives their palm of fame. Oh could those âfrail impures,â who heedless make Their pearls the banquet of the swinish rake, Once know the pain that men of sense endure When virtuous speeches flow from lips impure; Or the deep interest which we all possess; When real virtue acts the feign'd distress; They'd seek the homage to your virtues due, Reform their manners and soon copy you. And first of these, attractive DARLEY see, The graceful daughter of simplicity. Thine is the art, sweet actressânot the artâ Noâsimple nature moves thy feeling heart; She gives to all you act that magick charm, Which chains attention and all hearts can warm: In craz'd Ophelia speaks the maniack mind; Smiles the gay look of sportive Rosalind; 'Twas nature's voice, when fair Virginia sung; The Voice of Nature is thy mother's tongue. But yet the lynx-eyed Muse espies one blot, On thy bright sun she notes one single spot;â With folded hands see Rosamunda stands: Ah me! how pretty are her folded hands? Enchanting attitude, which Nature drawsâ Pit, boxes, gallery, bellow out applause. With varied voice, which can all hearts control, With various movements to entrap the soul, With air, face, person, shape, and blooming age, With powers to grace with novelty the stage, Do not lov'd actress, while each heart expands, Forever bore us with your folded hands. But if this gentle hint won't make you screen 'em, Oh, take the gentle poet in between 'em! But next the chasten'd POWELL steps serene, Correct in motion, utterance, looks and mien; Never o'erstepping nature's modest aims, And always acting up what nature claims: No passion tearer on a ranting stage, No screaming favourite of a tasteless age, Sporting no jokes to show a meagre wit, Or tricksey arts to catch a tittering pit; Content each character to represent, And simply show us what the author meant. What though thy scenick pencil oft portrays Fine strokes of nature lost to common gaze? The purblind many can't read nature's line, Unless in lamp-black capitals it shine. What though less frequent shouts thy worth reward, And the house slumbers when it should applaud? Be thine the approving smile of all the chaste, Thine the proud plaudit of the man of taste. But, last of all, see COOPER grace the stageâ COOPERââthe pride, the wonder of our age!â Here place the laurel, crown him with thy bays, Nor aim to praise him WHO'S BEYOND ALL PRAISE. A Card. The author of the Epilogue of the Theatrical Season presents his most profound compliments to the Manager, Messrs. Bernard, Fox, &amp;c. not forgetting his kind of love to certain ladies of the corpsâand, after apologizing for omitting them in that honied eulogium, has the honour to assure them that he has in the bottom of his inkhorn a most delectable bit of poetry, in which their respective merits will be amplified, and their faults handled with the gossamour glove of criticismâ and in which the prompter will be promptedâthe box-keeper shall have a ticketâthe door-keeper shall not be shut outâthe yellow ochre fame of the scene painter shall not be painted in mere water coloursâand even the extinguishing glory of the candle-snuffer shall shine like a cut-glass chandelier. Oh! Let Me Lay this Burning Cheek ... The attribution of this poem is uncertain. âOh! let me lay this burning cheek Upon that snowy breast of thine, And with thy lips' balsamic dew O cool these fever'd lips of mine!â Thus Daphnis spokeâthe fire that rag'd Within him sparkled in his eye; Ah, sure 'twould be a sin to suffer So sweet a youth in flames to die! ââI felt his warm cheek trembling glow Upon the soft snows of my breast; âI felt the fever of the lips Which madly to my lips he press'd!â âBut ah!âthe fires that flush'd that cheek And lip, alas! too late I see No snows of mine can coolâfor oh! The subtle flame has melted me.ââ Ye maidens!âguard those lips from lips That warmly glow and warmly speak; And guard oh! guard those breasts of snow, âThey melt beneath a burning cheek! Love Varses to the Bucheous Daffodel Immediately after the season closed, I addressed the following Varses to my dear Mistriss; wherein I have attempted some of the graces of our theatrical style of pronunciation, by spelling the words as they were pronounced on the boards, as far as our sorry alphabet would enable me: for although our cris-cross row is abundantly ample to express the pronunciation of a Cicero, Ames, or Chatham, yet the poor letters often appear to make awkward and abortive efforts to delineate the elegant tones of our more polished players. S. Alas! my shweet Daffodel's eyes Aye made a greet ole in my arts With rapchure my art almost dies, When I see my adjored depart. She's as bucheous as morning in May; No wonder to love I'm injuc'd; She's the shweetest of creachures I say, That nachure has ever projuc'd. Not Harculus boasts of more force; Not Dougle-ss shows more desire; Not Caato more virchus resource; Nor Uthellur e'er rag'd with more fireâ Than I for shweet Daffodel feel, When jest by the woodlands we meet: She's the emblum of all that's genteel; She's parfect in all that is shweet. I made her a promus of love; To ajore her ever was my juty: I was onest and true as a dove, For who could be false to such a beauche! I never my promus will breek, Though the whirld should in phalanx oppose: Her virchue will bind me to keep What her radiunt eyes did impose. My art haches to think on her charms Lest forchune her aspect should churn:â Was the beauche but once in my harms, She from me should never rechurn. Shet out from her presence I mope; The shepherds all call me schupid: Would forchune then lend me a rope, I'd soon bid ajue to shweet Cupid. If I lose her, I'll mount on my orse, To bid her ajue then inclin'd; And to cheer my art under her loss; I'll drink off a bottle of wind.

A Fable Mr. Oldschool, You will no doubt recognize, in a part of the following Fable, the favorite theme of the eastern poets, the loves of the Rose and the Nightingale. I believe I am not mistaken in supposing it to be one of those poetical ideas which any one may avail himself of. Yours, &amp;c Sâ A rose while yet 'twas early morn, Was glowing on her dewy thorn. The smallest of the elfin kind That thro' the garden flowers wind, Beheld where, like another day, She op'd in morning on the spray, Amid her orient leaflets flew, And sipt his fill of scented dew; âSweet blossom,â then he softly cry'd, With voice that mid the petals died, âSweet blossom, for this draught divine, Some splendid present shall be thine, Thou art so fair all flowers before, That 'twould be vain to deck thee more, But when the shades of night appear, To blend the ugly and the fair, That thy bright charms may still be seen, And thou still reign of flowers the queen, My lamp I'll bring, the glow-worm bright, And hang amid thy leaves its light.â The rose receiv'd, with modest bend, The promise of her fairy friend, Who brought at twilight's tranquil hour The lanthorn of her little bower, That threw its threadlike beams around, And shed a radiance on the ground; A Nightingale, who warbled nigh, 'Midst darksome boughs, with greedy eye Beheld the glitt'ring prize that hung With diamond light her leaves among, And straight in lays that lull'd the grove, Caroll'd a tender tale of love. Soft flower, her breast withstands not long The varying music of his song; But soon what pangs assail'd that breast! For scarce the nuptial kiss he prest, But tore from its supporting spray, The Fairy's gift, and hopt away. O Rose, it was thy lot to prove The lowest Vice may feign like Love, Nor is it such sorrow thine alone; Full many a maid thy fate has known, Whom fortune (by the hand of heaven, With unveiled eyes a moment given, Her blind-groped favourites to behold) Has lent the gorgeous light of gold, That virtue's charms with beauty join'd Might wide be seen and win mankind; But ah! that light's resplendent dawn, Interest the heartless slave has drawn, Who sings Love's soul-enthralling lay, So to revel in the golden ray. The Town Eclogue A FRAGMENT To welcome nature in her early spring ... Davenant See, see, bluff winter quits the town, And congees with her surly frown: In her train the beldame carries All sweet Fashion's gay vagaries; Her cork soal'd shoes, and bonnet rough, Her camel shawl and bearskin muff, Her beaver gloves and fleecy dress, Red comforter and silk pelice; And what is worse, the beldame's stole Of all our bliss the very soul, Has stole the concert, play, and ball; And what is still the worst of all, Has Cooper stole, and with him fled, And left us ?????? in his stead. See the town bred Spring advancing, Friend to grass, and foe to dancing! See adorn her lovely tresses Cabbage-sprouts and water cresses! While for plume, the hoyden lass Sports a bunch of sparrow grass. See, beneath her market wreath, She smiles her dandelion teeth; Whilst with voice as sweet, or sweeter, As Billings' strains or Sternhold's metre, With voice which musick cannot ape her, Like nightingale or Mrs. Draper, She cheers her pannier's mare and screams Her strawberries and fresh string-beans: Or, whilst her one-wheel'd chariot rattles, She bawls her epicurean chattels; Her shelly stores from old Cape Cod, Her mackerel, lobsters, and tom-cod: Or, in her awning stalls displays, Her tempting lures to hungry gaze; Her luscious stores of fish, fowl, flesh; Cod's tongues and sounds, and smelt, and eel, Calves' feet and head, and pluck, and vealâ Far richer flowers than rural spring From all her scented hoards can bring. For can the rose's gayest die With salmon sous'd in beauty vie? Or can the rose's sweetest smell Vie with fresh caught mackerel? Her rustick coz let others sing, But let me taste the town bred Spring. Close by her side see ?????? smile, That critick in dumb-fish and oil, Who thinks there's heaven in good dinners, And hell is fill'd with hungry sinners. Close by her side the glutton stands, And takes his snuff, and rubs his hands, With critick nose assays her trash, And licks his lips and pays the cash. Horace, Ode XXII, Lib. I Integer vitae, scelerisque purus ... Grac'd with a temper void of affectation, She who alone her native charms relies on, Needs not the aid of rouge, ceruse, or carmine, Mortal with poison; Whether in the ball room down the dance she wanders, Or at the concert, where no frozen beaux melt, Or in the stage box where sly comick Twaits pours The full tide of laughter. She at her book, from toilet cares abstracted, Simply attired, a smart dashing beau saw; Sawâand tripp'd offâpronouncing her a queer quiz, Or a bore most horrid. Such a smart tippy fashionable England Ne'er could produce through all her realms of Bond-street, Nor dressy France, that nursery of fashion, Land of petit-maitres. Place her where never lemonade or silk fan Cool'd the flush'd partner, wearied in cotillion, Or where old bachelors, powder'd by time's friseur, Gloom the horizonâ Place her in massy iron grated nunnery, Where chaste Diana o'er the frost bit vestals, Snows with icy rigour, and the pent up virgins, Freeze to old maids. Still shall the sweet nymph never fail to charm me, Who in neat attire with the blush of nature, Looks interesting when she's sweetly smiling, Sweetly conversing. An Epistle to My Muse: Or, a Postscript to the Epilogue to the Theatrical Season They tell me, Muse, that thou and I, sweet rogue, Have sadly miss'd it in our Epilogue. Jack Dash pronounc'd it a most horrid bore; The author's a mere quiz, Dick Dumpish swore; And e'en Miss Phebe showed her sex's spite, And âvowed the thing was vastly impolite.â But what, my Muse, should more surprise create, Miss Prue declared it so indelicate, So thick with double vile entendre strown, It made her blush to read it when alone! O DELICACY! blushing, timorous maid, Of substance nought, of shadows oft afraid, Who can't a sermon read without a qualm, And find'st a double meaning in a psalm; And whilest the poet's page thy heart alarms, With cobweb muslin scarcely veils thy charms; Pardon, sweet nude, and calm thy prudish flutter, Just glance thy eyes on thy own tonish tucker: Let Modesty pronounce, with judgment clear, Who most offends her eye, or most her ear. But zounds, what noise distracts my nerves of hearings! What horrid cursing, damming, sinking, swearing! It seems as if a thousand Jacks were braying, Or if ten thousand ?????'s were huzzaing. ââflat,âlow,âstuff,âmeanâfroth! âthe poet and the printer both. O Gad confound the odus rhyming fellur! I hates him worser than the Moor Urthellur: I promus him that I despise his drivelâ O he's the very emblum of the Divel.â This chasten'd language surely well explains From whence proceed these Chesterfieldian strains: Such brimstone tropes with certainty presage That school of Virtue, our pure, moral stage. For lo! the Green Room quakes with wild uproar, Vindictive furies seize the Thespian Corps; Melpomene her blood-stained dagger draws, Prepares her poison'd bowl to drench my jaws; The shingle dagger, Harlequin, is thine; Vex'd Thalia dips her comick lash in brine; And all the play-house gods prepare for fighting, With sheepskin thunder and bright rosin lightning; While ?????'s voice, like London watchman's rattle, Or light-horse conch shell, sounds the corps to battle; And AtÃ¨ fierce, in shape of Mrs. ????, Cries Havock! and lets slip the pups of war. But say, my Muse, what all this noise provokes, Why dwells such mighty rage in little folks? 'Tis our vile epilogue has caused this fury, And raised this tumult in our Yankee Drury, Some are enrag'd, their merits were not rais'd, And others vex'd that rivals were beprais'd; Some angry, that their slightest faults were scann'd; And some d?d mad, because they were not dammn'd; Some blame too liberal, some too scanty praise, And all provok'd that ????? gain'd the bays; All, all inflam'd, and all prepared to shed The Thespian rancour on the poet's headâ Prepared to pour the vengeance of the stage, With all the impotence of Green Room rage. Come, come, sweet Muse, let's close this doughty quarrel! Go, get thy critick specs, and bunch of laurel. The Thespian ranks we will again display, And drum the corps to one more muster-day! No biting satire shall deform our lays With bluff contempt or odious sneering praise: From Flattery's beds we'll cull our rhyming posies, Perfum'd with otto, wash'd with the milk of roses; Our errours past we'll mend in this soft sequel, And sooth their palates with our sweetest treacle. With rosy cheeks and eyes of glassy blue, And each pleas'd actor now shall gaily seem A Christmas window, stuck with evergreen. And see, my Muse, once more the mimick train, All eager, panting, emulous of fame; With sacred love of fame all, all infectedâ They'd rather be lampoon'd than be neglected. And first, my Muse, the dapper ??? draws nigh, The very Harlequin of tragedy; That merry mourner with his giggling Oh! That sneering, skipping, tripping type of woe; That solemn droll, with tragicomick sneer; That joking Numpo in the robes of Lear. 'T is his, when sorrow should becloud his face, To vent his anguish in a broad grimace; When grief should fill the anguish'd sufferer's eye, To smartly wink a tear or snort a sigh: And when the poniard strikes the hero's heart, And the soul struggles from the flesh to part, Like country bumpkin, (now it's time to die) He scrapes his foot and bids the folks Good-bye! In tragick attitude see ????? stand, With melting eyes and elevated hand; Some mighty sorrow labouring in her breast, With frame convuls'd she heaves the burthen'd chest, While limbs, air, features, all at once express The scorpion anguish of her deep distress. But whence proceeds, my Muse, her lengthen'd pause? When will this statue ope her marble jaws? For still she stands, in all her tragick pride, Like tearful Niobe, quite petrified: Say, what narcotick charm has seiz'd the maid? Why, don't you see?âshe waits the prompter's aid! Nowânow she bursts the deep impassion'd pause, And tortures feeling with herâHemsâandâHaâs. But who is he, that hops upon the boards, With voice, like mastiff, growling out his words? Sure Nature's journeymen the fellow made From mouldy scraps and offals of their trade! With twin pretensions, Muse, he seeks thy praise, And claims thy comick wreath and tragick bays. What cobweb hopes vain-glorious folly spins! I only wish the fellow's legs were twinsâ For, while his right leg cuts the Thespian caper, His left leg stands idle, calm spectator; Or steel dividers, while one foot is fast, The other round and round is nimbly cast; Or novice actor, when he waits his cue, Standing unmov'd, as if he'd nought to do. If both legs move, poor ?????? seems to go, Like begging cripple, with a timber toe; Or mismatch'd poneys, in a hackney racing, With near nag trotting and the off one pacing. But even ??????'s praise the Muse will sing, When he enacts of the Danish player king. When, through the lips of Hamlet, Shakespeare sage, With critick rules, corrects the erring stage, When ?????? shinesâhis voice and action shew The blundering actor, whom old Shakespeare drew: See-saws the air, and swells, and struts, and brags, And kicks and tears a passion into rags. Sweet are the smiles which timid maids dispense, Sweet the coy looks of bashful innocence; But sweeter far the lovely actress seems, Who veils with modesty the loosest scenes. Whether in manly garb compell'd to appear, Or forc'd to assume the meretricious leer, Still female sanctity and worth are seen To claim respect and chasten every scene. Not so smart ????? meets the publick eye; She scorns the aid of homespun modesty; Thinks broad assurance is prodigious merit, And gives to double meanings all their spirit; Stares at the pit, and ogles rakes and beaux, And sports her ankle gay with pick-nick hose; And boldly says, as plain as looks can say, âCome, look atâIâand never mind the play!â Now, angry Muse, assume thy sternest frown, And drive this worse than tippler from the town. With those she favours let her seek her lot, With rake-hell bully and vile dashing sot. And, Muse, proclaim thy Mede-and-Persian law, And let the Thespian corps attend with aweâ From time henceforth no player shall succeed To publick favour, or obtain thy meed, Who seeks by folly to obtain bare fame, Or puts the cheek of modesty to shame. (To be concluded.) The Reeling Roscius, An Epigram Tom Rantum, a buck and comical dog, With his heart full of glee and his head full of grog, One eve to the play-house, in good sailing trim, With a swing and a hiccough went reeling ripe in. Tom collar'd poor P?????, and swore he'd engage Some devilish high-go to act on the stage. âYour Bernard's a quiz, and your Twaits is a bum, Let ME go on the stage, and I'll show the house fun.â The manager, seeing Tom Rantum's gay trim, With this smooth civil speech thought to humor his whim: âWhat characters, sir, will you purpose to act? I must know what you'll play before we contract.â âPlay!âDâmeâyour question be cursed uncivil! Play?âhickupâPlay?âhickupâWhy I'll play the DEVILââ Elegy Occasioned by the death of the Rev. Samuel Stillman, D. D. Pastor of the First Baptist Church of Boston Oh, Death! fell tyrant of a ruined world, Can nothing from thy power despotick save? And must the virtuous, the revered be hurled In sad succession to the putrid grave? Thy voice terrifick must we all obey? Will nought avail the prayer or tearful eye? Must thou o'er all yet hold thy equal sway, And reign with dreadful impartiality? Yes; for that stronger voice, which at the first From sluggish earth bade man in beauty bloom, So by its word ordained, that âDust to dust,â Must be of man the dread perpetual doom. But hark! what loud lament, what sobs of wo, What gloom o'er every passing face is spread! The ruthless tyrant gives the fatal blow, And numbers STILLMAN with the sainted dead. Mute is that warning voice, whose power awoke The sleeping conscience from its dread repose; Closed are those eyes, which, more than words, bespoke What his full heart sustained for human woes. That voice no more shall his full heart express, Or truths sublime in glowing style dispense, His active arm shall never more impress The fervid Preacher's thundering eloquence. The stately cenotaph, the Parian bust, The sculptured urn, let polished Europe raise; In gorgeous fabricks place the mitred dust, On brazen tablets grave the Hierarch's praise. No proud cathedrals here their pomp display, Whose fretted domes their spacious concaves spread, Where through the pictured panes the dubious day Shades the prized reliques of the honoured dead. What though no massy fanes his dust inclose, No brass or marble his loved form supply; Yet, not forgotten shall his dust repose, Nor yet unhonoured shall the good man die. No; while one ray of poesy divine Cheers the sad poet in this darksome scene, Still in his humble verse the just shall shine, Still shall his laurels bloom eternal green: And memory, faithful to its sacred trust, Shall from oblivion snatch the good man's name; When art's proud monuments shall sink in dust, On living tablets shall engrave his fame. O, could I breathe that vivifying breath, Which the rapt prophet's God alone could give, Which, in the arid vale of numerous death, Made the dry fragment bones to rise and live! Then should the Christian sage from forth the fold Of fetid death in pristine might ascend, And many a grief-swoln eye again behold The husband, father, preacher, and the friend. Then should the sabbath's hallowed chimes expand, And crowding converts to the church repair, STILLMAN again should lead the new born band, And raise the incense of the fervent prayer. Lo! in the sacred desk I see him stand, His form, his features once again I trace; And, like th' angelick choir in Judah's land, He brings âglad tidingsâ to man's ruined race. Hark! hear ye not again that voice sublime? It calls the dead in sin to life and light; Say, mark you not that countenance divine, That troubled gesture, and that arm of might? See, whilst the glowing truth assails the mind, And wakes the passions from their fatal sleep, The spirit rushes like a mighty wind, The flint dissolves, the hardened sinners weep! But ah! how soon the poet's dream is past, The fleeting vision flits like mortal breath, Nought but the last loud trumpet's potent blast, Can rouse the slumberer from the bed of death. Ah, where is now affliction's constant friend, Where the consoler of the mind distrest? Whose prayerful skill the broken heart co[u]ld mend, And soothe the troubled conscience into rest. Ah, where is he, who, by the dying bed, Calmed the last passage of the struggling breath, Illumed with gospel hope the fainting head, And changed to bursts of joy the pangs of death! And you, ye wretched many, who have gone In weeds of sorrow through this vale of wo, Who oft have wept the near connection borne To the dark regions of man's conquering foe, No more shall STILLMAN seek your roofs of pain, With mild consoling voice the wretched cheer; No more the widow's sinking heart sustain, Or wipe the anguished orphan's scalding tear. To the grave fathers of our favoured land, No more shall he enforce the freeman's right; Or at the bidding of the warriour band, Teach the true christian soldier how to fight. No more the malefactor, doomed to die, From STILLMAN'S lips shall learn a Saviour's name, Learn, like th' expiring thief on Calvary, To mount to glory from the depths of shame. But cease, fond muse, his virtues to recount; Vain is the task which thy rash pen employs; When all is done, 'tis but the sad account, The sable schedule of departed joys. Peace to thy ashes, then, thou man of God; To thy approving Judge we thee resign: 'TIS OURS to bear the chastenings of his rod, The peaceful Sabbath of the tomb is THINE. Epigrammatick Sketch Prithee do you know Tom Tweezer, He that has a wife so pretty? Tom's whole soul is bent to please her, And to see her drest the tippy. Beaux point the opera glass and swear that Mrs. Tweezer's all the rage; The ladies, one and all, declare that Tom's the best husband of the age. Spring or fall ships never lie to, But Tom, ever bent to please her, Flies to Mrs. Cruft's to buy too, Something smart for Mrs. Tweezer. Crape, cambrick, lutestring, sattinet, Muslin, chambray, piquet, leno, Armlets, caps of spider net, And of smart things more than we know. But oft, when happy Tom would fly To buy the tasty for his dearest, He found that fashion had gone by, Of queer things he had bought the queerest. Too oft he hears his dear remark, While with disdain her eyes she rolls, âWhy sure this came from Noah's ark, Lard! it is as old as poles. âYou know, my love, that Sally Flaret Wore sich a one last Friday night; How could you think that I would wear it, 'T would make me look like sich a frite!â Running, puffing, panting, sweating, The anxious Tom I chanced to meet; On his brow deep thought was sitting, In both his hands a band box neat. Prithee, Thomas, why so hasty? You run as if you ran for life. âO, I've purchased something tasty, A smart new bonnet for my wife. âStop me not, I must not falter, I must hasten to my true one, The fashion else I fear will alter, And my Duck will want a new one!â The Wolf and Wooden Beauty. An Old Fable New Vamped Once on a time a Wolf did pop His head into a Carver's shop, And there espied a bust of wood, Made to resemble flesh and blood, With eyes so black and skin so fair, And arched brows and curled hair, With pouting lips, and bosom's swell, Cheeks painted like a modern belle, Features in the most tonnish style, Which simpered a perpetual smile. He took her for a bright beauty's goddess, With cestus round her Paphian boddice. But the poor beast had never seen The blooming charms of Charlotteâ For had he known the lovelier Charlotte, He'd thought not on that heavenly harlot, âO Jove,â he cried, âwhat pangs I feel; How handsome, dashy and genteel; If such her outward form I find, What are the beauties of her mind! Sure she that's so divinely pretty Must be supremely wise and witty.â He bowed and scraped, first at a distance; But finding she made no resistance, And to his flatteries all the while Kept up the same enchanting smile, Like brisk gallant whose roguish trade is To steal the hearts of simple ladies, Who when he hopes to gain their favour, Still takes his cue from their behaviour, And still applies his arts ensnaring, Till frowns repulsive check his daring. So Isgrim made more bold advances Lured by his timberlove's kind glances; At length he dared assail her honour And clapped his brutal paw upon her. But when he found her made of wood, In dumb perplexity he stood, Then pawed the souless beauty o'er, And finding her a horrid bore, He thus exclaimedââAh what a bite, This comes from loving at first sight! Thy features, mien, and tonnish dress, Seem formed a lover's heart to bless; But ah! within thy pretty skull, How mean, how empty and how dull, Beauty, 'tis true, all hearts enflames, But what is beauty without brains?â He said no more, but with a hop, Growling contempt, he left the shop. âWhat have we here?â the Cynick cries, With frowning brow and critick eyesâ âWhat childish prattle 'tis to tell Of talking beast and wooden belle! A nursery tale, and only meet To lull a brawling brat to sleep. Shall we, in this enlightened age, Quit the delights of Shakespeare's page, Leave plays and novels and romances For such poor mawkish childish fancies? In school-boy days we had enough Of Aesop's tales, and such like stuff.â But stop, my snarling, pride-puffed Cynick, This tale has got a moral in it: And this same moral may apply Perhaps to boys of six feet high. Have you not seen?âcome, tell me truly, (I know they're scarce as frost in July,) Some female heads, no matter where, Perhaps in Maine, or Delaware, In Narraganset, or Patucket, Or Martha's Vineyard, or Nantucket, For wheresoe'er you did accost one, We know 'twas not in town of Boston; For there the gentlemen will swear The ladies are as wise as fair. Have you not seen some female noddles As beautiful as Grecian models, Made perfect by the hand of nature With nicest symmetry of feature, With spangled combs and gay egretts, Or frizelled, jewelled, smart frizetts, With essence, curling and pomatum, Made fine as Lane or Swett could make 'emâ Faces that might with Venus vie, Or give to Helen's charms the lie; Eyes, which sparkled with love's wiles; Cheeks dimpling forth perpetual smiles; And coral lips, which op'd beneath, Not to converse, but, show pearl teeth; Have you not seen?âZounds, stop your pen; Yes, I have seenâand pray what then? Then if you seek to choose a wife, To comfort, stay, enliven life, Not the companion of a day, But help-meet on life's weary way; Not she who thinks that life was made For dress, and flutter, and parade; Who, scorning sweet domestick duty, Sighs for the sovereignty of beauty, And at the play house, mall, or ball, Though bound to one, would conquer allâ But she who fills with nobler pride, That female throne, the fire side; Who, with her bridal dress, lays by The whims of girlish vanity; And, in their stead, with pride embraces The modest matron's solid graces; Who seeks alone the toilet's aid, To keep the conquest she has made And makes, and seeks to make alone, Your interests, cares, and joys her own. And, should life's olive branches rise To bless your fond parental eyes, SHE who with all a mother's care, The nursling plants can fondly rear; The excrescent shoots with firmness prune, Each noxious weed with care consume, Till, nurtured by her fostering hand, The rising plants grow and expand; Bud, blossom, bearâwhile each survives, The ripened fruits of virtuous lives. Or should misfortunes dire assail, And friends look cold and credit fail, She who through each distressing scene, Is prudent, constant, and serene; Who, when woes cluster, and the frown Of wealth unfeeling, weighs you down, With sweet affection's kindly power, Sustains you in that trying hour; Or, on her fond and faithful breast, Lulls all your sorrows into rest.â When sickness comes, (as come it must, To us, weak children of the dust; For life, when all its joys we have, Is but a turnpike to the grave; And fever, cholick, stone and gout, Are but mere guide posts on the rout.)â When sickness comes, and fever dire Awakes its slow consuming fire, Or, when enraged, the tyrant reigns Triumphant in your mantling veins; When watchers fail, and nurses tire, And hope seems ready to expire, SHE, who with ever ready hand, Takes by your side her patient stand; With velvet step draws nigh your bed, The pillow smooths beneath your head; Cools your parch'd tongue with proffer'd sweets; Though oft repulsed with kindness greets; With languid smile can still sustain The wayward petulance of pain, Echo your groans, your sighs renew, And seem to suffer more than you. Come, youthful Bachelors, be candid, Nor use me as that cynick man didâ An honest answer I requireâ Is this the wife that you desire? If so, before you rashly wed, Muse on the simple tale you've read; Before you tie the fatal knot, Think of the Wolf and Carver's Shop. The Newsmonger MR. EDITOR. If any one of your brethren of the type contemplates the publication of a Newspaper, and should be puzzling himself for a title and motto, and cannot find better, the following are much at his service.

Oh as you read, Let deep reflection mark the varied tale. Dr. Underhill's Manuscript Poems. Ode to Friendship Oh, thou whose power to sooth the heart, When bleeding in distress, To pour in Sorrow's wounds a balm, The grief-worn troubled breast to calm, And dull the point of Care's corroding dart, With rapture all confess; Hail lovely Friendship, source of social joy, A youthful Muse this tribute pays To thee, in humble, artless lays, Daughter of Heav'n, whose pleasures never cloy! Blest with thy smiles to soften Misery's frown, The rustick tenant of the lowly shed, At eve with thee, to chase fatigue away, And in the joys forget the busy day, Lies far more happy in his rush-strew'd bed Than sceptr'd majesty who rests on down, Whose flattered will obsequious wait The sycophants of pomp and state, But not one faithful friend! For on the crown and purple robe alone And not on brilliant pain that fills the throne The venal crowd of parasites attend. If doomed the stings of adverse fate to feel, And all the pangs of each concordant ill, Which they who thread the vale of life must bear; If Health affrighted flies my bed of care, Give one sweet maid, I ask no more, A friend to cheer life's dreary hour, And when oppressed with poignant grief, To give my woes a sweet relief And soothe my anguished breast; Give me to whom I can impart The smiles and sorrows of my heart; Let others be more blest. And when no power my fleeting life can save, Give me one friend to mourn me in the grave. Poor Mary âHe simply told the village taleâ Stay strangerâsee yon drooping fair, Why stream the tears from either eye? Why loose her locks of auburn hair, And pale her cheek? Say, stranger, why? The lily now usurps the place On Mary's cheek, where bloom'd the rose; Her eye once beam'd with ev'ry grace, Which now with pearly tears o'erflows. What bids those pearly tears to flow, And dims the radiance of those eyes? Why bears the maid the garb of wo, Say, why does Mary heave those sighs? âThe tale is sad. Young Henry lov'd The weeping maid; his love was true, And Mary soon his vows approved, For Henry's matchless worth she knew. âEach youth and maiden bless'd the pair, Their joy became the village theme, But joy was darken'd by despair, And vanish'd like a morning dream. âFor, ah! the bud of love scarce bloom'd, (Their guileless hearts with hopes elate,) When to the grave untimely doom'd, Poor Mary mourn'd her Henry's fate! âTwas this that caus'd that look of wo, And chang'd to pale that rosy hue, For this those tears of sorrow flow, And dim her eyes of heavenly blue.â Sweet maid, farewellâthy sorrows claim A tear from gentle Pity's eye, And when we sigh poor Mary's name, That Echo should responsive sigh, Poor Mary. Part IV 1808â1826 Ode Yes, Love thou ruler of the human heart, Yes, Tyrant offspring of the Paphian Queen, 'Tis thou alone, who by thy venomed dart, Hast caused these pangs so exquisitely keen, But why didst thou, oh Fate severe, Condemn this faithful heart to bear The sum of woes, the chief of ills, The pangs the hopeless lover feels? Who mourns his lot with many a falling tear, Who sighs his sorrows to the changing wind, Changing as she, who once to him was kind, But now who flies his love, and leaves him to despair? Why doom to burn within my constant heart, A passion kindled by Maria's charms? Bereft of hope, I see a rival blest, A rival happy in Maria's arms: No more her fatal charms I'll view, That first enchant and then undo; I'll fly the lovely faithless maid, My griefs I'll tell the silent shade, And to the lonely rocks my wailings pour; There will I dream of joys I cannot taste, And in the dreary, wild, and pathless waste, Find that tranquillity to me unknown before! And when my weary race of life is run, And every sting of recent wo is fled, When droops beneath the wave my setting sun, And Fate lets fall her veil around my head; If then Maria, cruel maid, Should tread the turf where low I'm laid, Her falsehood will be all forgiv'n, My shade will feel the wished-for heaven, If, conscious that my grave she's wandering near, Some latent spark of love should still survive, Some gentle sigh should wish me still alive, And on my lifeless head should fall compassion's tear. Song Sweet as the balmy rose just blown, Were Kitty's cheeks of blushing hue, Her eyes like noon-day sunbeams shone, Her lips were moist as ev'ning dew, Oh lovely was my Kitty! Her breath as morning Zephyrs sweet, And tun'd to love, her constant heart, 'Twas rapture with my Kate to meet, But ah! 'twas misery to part. How blest was I with Kitty! My Kitty dead! her parting breath Confess'd her heart was true to me, Oh! soon my Kate we'll meet in death, Oh soon sweet maid I'll come to thee! He sunk and call'd on Kitty! Song Oh say from thy bosom why heaves the soft sigh, Why fades the red bloom of thy cheek. Why glistens the tear in thy lovely blue eye, When with thee of parting I speak. My sweetest Mary? Inconstant to all its fond vows, can my heart Deceitful to Mary e'er prove? Or if Fate decrees that from thee I must part, E'er cease to remember with Love My sweetest Mary? Then weep not dear girl if I leave thee behind, My love shall forever endure; Though beauty may fade, yet the charms of thy mind, From falsehood my heart will secure. My sweetest Mary. Ode From Hafiz Shiraz, to thee I pour the votive song, And greet thy towers; lovely city hail! Hail all the beauties, which to thee belong; May heaven protect thy walls, when storms assail. Sweet stream of Rocnabad, whose waters clear, The envied life of Khedher can bestow, May every source of thine to Heaven be dear, And with unsullied pureness ever flow. In Giaferabad's sweet walks I stray, Where balmy zephyrs ever breathe perfume; Or in the rosy bowers of Mosellay, Whose charms to rank with those may well presume. Haste ye, who pleasure seek! to Shiraz fly! Implore the damsels of that lovely place To hear the vows of love; they'll not deny, In each ye'll surely find an angel's face. Of Egypt's luscious sugar may ye boast, Who ne'er have known what maids in Shiraz dwell; But there sweetness would be quickly lostâ For Shiraz' damsels every sweet excel. Soft zephyr, com'st thou from my lovely maid? And can my ardent vows her bosom move? Yet ah! why dissipate from sleep the shade? For I was happy when I dreamt of love. But should my fair one doubt my constant heart, Sweet Zephyr, tell her that its streams I'll pour, And with my life's blood will as freely part, As when her parent gave the milky store. Ah since thou dreadest thus the parting hour, The last adieu, the separating kiss: Hafiz, cease not to thank thy Guardian Power, When with her presence, thou art crown'd with bliss. Ode From Hafiz O thou who breath'st the matin air, Sweet gentle Zephyr, tell me where My well beloved dwells, That moon of beauty, love, and joys Who rash admirers soon destroys, Who ev'ry one excels. The night is dark, and Aiman's vale Appears obscure; the moon is pale Which late with splendour drest The rising hills. Ah! who will lead The anxious lover o'er the mead, With his sweet maid to rest? In ev'ry climate fools abound, E'en now we see men searching round, But who can find a sage? Who understands the sense concealed, Let him rejoice; when unrevealed, Shall we explain our page? With each dark ringlet of thine hair, I have a thousand things my fair, To regulate alone: Ah! where's the sense I once could boast? Alas in wine and love all lost; Ah! where's the censor's frown? Thy musky tresses charm my heart I feel each raptur'd sense depart Ah! why am I thus moved? No joys the wine, dance, roses have Without thee, life is like the grave, Ah! where is my beloved? From autumn's winds securely plac'd In bow'rs with ev'ry beauty grac'd Still Hafiz is forlorn; He feels without thee pain in joy, In every pleasure some alloy, In ev'ry rose a thorn. Ode From Hafiz Boy, bring the cups, and place to all around, With sparkling wine the thirsty goblets fill, A cure for lover's pain in them is found, And wine is remedy for ev'ry ill. Like the bright god of day is glowing wine, And like the pale-fac'd orb of night, the bowl, Haste! bring the Moon, that she may with us shine, And round the splendid Sun a circle roll. Fill high the liquid flame, enjoy the hour, Let roses fade, their beauties will not dwell, Forget they wither, for the wine we pour Can all the roses of the world excel. And should the warblings of the nightingale No more with melody enchant the soul, Soon let us cease her lost notes to bewail, And hear the musick of the passing bowl. Should Fortune frown, (who once appear'd thy friend) And deaf to pray'rs refuse thy fervent suit, Cast every grief aside, and then attend The sound harmonious of the well-strung lute. When sleep o'ercomes my now half-closed eyes, I'll see my fair one, dream I taste her kiss, Fill high again! pour, pour the wine I prize To haste the moment of expected bliss. For each mad act, when Frenzy seized my soul The surest remedy my friends e'er found Was wine: replenish then my thirsty bowl Till every sense in rosy wine be drown'd. Again fill the sparkling goblet's brim, Heed not the censor, nor the railing crowd, Approve or disapprove, alike to him, Hafiz will drink forbidden or allowed. Impromptu To a Young Lady Playing If now Timotheus were alive, Again in musick's art to strive, To you who well deserve the prize The crown would soon be given, For while with ease and grace you play, Each earthly thought is charm'd away, You seem an angel to our eyes, We think ourselves in heaven. The Mantle of Washington Hark! heard ye not the cannons roar The volied Muskets murd'rous peal The dreadfull battles wild uproar The horrid clash of hostile steel? Hark! heard ye not that savage yell? That female shriek!âthat dying groan? That groan was the fond husbands knell That skriek, the hapless widows moan. The foe is triumphant, the war-hoop proclaims; The scalps are suspended, the wounded are dead; The dwelling of peace is a prey to the flames; And the captive in tears into bondage is led. Ah! where are her husband, her children, her babe? Her babe which she press'd with delight to her breast; The tomahawk sunkâon the cold earth they're laid; The brains of the babe mark the spot where they rest Foul Demon of War! could not Europe suffice To glut thy gaunt maw with the life of the brave? But in our lov'd landâmust thy war-hoop arise? And thy banners of blood o'er our continent wave? At the Monsters dread marchâLo! Happiness flies And Commerce enfeebled droops, languishes, diesâ In this dread hour of dark dismay When hope scarce points a distant ray And no returning dove will bring The olive branch with hasty wing Sayâis there not one ray serene To cheer the darksome gloomy scene? Yes there's a time to mem'ry dear A Nameâwhich wretchedness can cheerâ Spirit of our Country rise From thy leaden slumber rise, Patriot Spirit! bring again In fancys splendid train The recollection dear of those proud days, When our National name Fill'd the loud trump of Fame, And the Universe echo'd with Washingtons Praise! Father of thy CountryâHear! Godlike Washington appearâ (Summon to thy faithful side Patriots once this Countrys pride With Thee in times of peril tri'd) And bid the appalling war hoop cease On this thy natal hour Display thy wonted power, And give thy bleeding Country Peace. Deaf to our prayers the Chieftain's laid In the dark earth of Vernons shade No more for us the hero fights No more the statesman guards our rights Insatiate Death! that vengefull blow Which laid the Matchless Chieftain low Blasted our Countrys Glory tooâ Fierce Despot of the dying hour The mortal only own'd thy sway His spirit scorn'd thy feeble power And sought the realms of endless dayâ Sainted Spirit stay thy flight Thine are glory's robes and crown Stay thy flaming car of light And cast thy earthly mantle downâ Joy! Joy! to our Country his mantle descends It is born[e] in proud tryumph by Washingtons friends. On Oceans wide domain Where her sons our rights maintain And conquer bleed or die While Britains yield or fly, And the Indent forc'd from their grasp Then amidst the battles roar, Does his fost'ring spirit soar And his Mantle waves high on the mast. Then come each Favourite Son Of Immortal Washington Let the Mantle he drop'd be boldly display'd It will Commerce restore Drive war from our shore For Washingtons Mantle is Peace and Free Trade. Song The splendid Sun prepares his steeds To mount the dappled skies, On mountains vales on moors and meads The scowling darkness flies. Awake my Love and with thine eyes Chase darkness from the heart you prize. The balmy breath of blushing morn The mounting skylarks greet; On bush and spray on shrub and thorn The feather'd lovers meet. Awake sweet maid and let us raise To Love the matin song of praiseâ November Come old November, since again We meet upon a withered plain, Give me thy handâI'll not repine, Perhaps thy influence is divine. Yet such thy rude and wild career, Such are thy ruins of the year: I'd almost stoop and bless the hour, To see the[e] robbed of so much power. A few days past the fields were green, And every beauty might be seen; The flower and vine ambitious vied, In charms of youth and summer's pride: The woods and fields were gaily dressed, And musick soothed the mind to rest. But now, alas! the scene is changed, And nature almost seems deranged. In throwing round thy frosty spear, The vine and leaves, the grass and ear; The woods, and plains, and village green, Reflect a dull and blighted sheen. Thus early summer's blossoms fadeâ Thus the bower, and thus the shadeâ The songsters of the woods are still, No longer echo to the rillâ And such is manâhis prime today, To-morrow sees him swept away. Sonnet On seeing a vessel weigh anchor for a long voyage Stately yon vessel sails adown the tide! To some far distant land adventurous bound, The sailors' busy cries from side to side, Pealing among the echoing rocks rebound: A patient, thoughtless, much enduring band, Joyful they enter on their ocean way, With shouts exulting leave their native land, And know no care beyond the present day. But is there no poor mourner left behind, Who sorrows for a child or husband there? Who at the howling of the midnight wind Will wake and tremble in her boding prayer? So may her voice be heard, and Heav'n be kind, Go, gallant ship, and be thy fortune fair! On the Death of a Little Child Well did the holy Prophet say, âMan is a flower and fades as soon; Wakes into birth in early day, And droops and withers ere 'tis noon.â All powerful Faith! 'Tis thine to show That here, tho' mortal flowerets die, They're but exotics here below,â Their native soil's above the sky. Death but transplants; he can't destroy: The immortal plants survive the tomb; In Heaven's parterres of peace and joy They flourish in immortal bloom. All pitying God! How oft we blame The stroke thy righteous will has given, When death in mercy only came To gather infant buds to Heaven! A Simile Serenely smiled The morning mild, With blushes all adorning The trees their verdant foliage spread, The flowers displayed their white &amp; red, The infant fruit peeped from the spray, All nature seemed to laugh &amp; play It was so fine a morning. But ere the sun His race had run The rising wind was storming, The sky with clouds was overcast, Fiercely blew the northern blast, And shrub and tree and fruit and flower, In wild confusion that dread hour, Lay scattered on the wasted plain, While stormy sleet, and hail, and rain, All nature seemed deforming. So smiles the rosy morn of youth, Beaming with innocence and truth, Adorned with hope and pleasure. But ere the race of life is run Bright hope's gay star, &amp; pleasure's sun, With all the glittering prospects round Sink in ruin's gulf profoundâ With sorrows beyond measure. THE âK.â POEMS The Inimitable Fair Respectfully Inscribed to a Bevy of Fair Ladiesâ Come pluck me a feather from Cupid's left wing And slit it &amp; nib it so finely And dip the gay pen in Castalea's best spring, That with it I may write divinely. I'll note down the charm of the nymph I adore, Oh! could I but note them so truly! You'd think that bright Venus had knock'd at your door, All clasp'd in her cestus so newly. My love has an air beyond all compare, And one of the loviest faces With sweet tell-tale eyes and fine ringlets of hair, In short she's grandchild to the graces. But her elegant mind, by learning refin'd, Lends a lustre to beauty's exterior While her wit so sublime, and her manner refin'd Evince that she has no superior. The last polish to give, sage wisdom 'tis known, Perfected her brilliant attractions; While piety, virtue and prudence all shone, In her words, and in her looks, and her actions. Now Fanny the pretty, &amp; Sally the witty, Lovely Sue with her blue laughing eyes, And Belles of the thicket, &amp; belles of the city, Are full of most curious surmise. âLa! who can she be, he don't surely mean me? Tho I own I am like her in mind; But the face, her sweet face, one plainly may see, Must be for some other design'd.â âLa! how can you talk so,â grave Anna exclaims, âThe face may suit one of your standing But I know who he means when her prudence he names, And speaks of her fine understanding.â Indeed, my sweet misses, your guess all amiss is, She is only Dame Fancy's bright daughter; And the Nymph who is wise, to herself ne'er applies, What may only expose her to laughter. Memory Forbear, my soul the recollection Of woes, thou art too weak to cope;â Come Mem'ry take a retrospection Of years that smil'd in joy and hope. When fancy, through the future roaring Would to my view sweet scenes pourtrayâ Her flight, the flow'ry path exploring, Where Joy and Pleasure lov'd to stray. Bright scenes!âon thee I dwell delighted, And lose th' remembrance of my woes: How sweet the thought of you, when blighted Is ev'ry prospect of repose. While on life's troubled ocean driven, By ev'ry gale of fortune tost; How sweet appears the peaceful haven I left behind on youth's bright coast. Yet, what I cherish as a treasure, Is but the illusion of a dream: I wakeâand quick dissolves each pleasure, As dew before the sun's bright beam. Long, long I've felt thy scourge, O Sorrow! By all the ills of life depresst: But HOPE dwells cheerful on that morrow, When I shall find substantial rest. Evening Hour There is a dear delightful hour, Enchanting, soothing in its pow'r, 'Tis when the fervid sun Has shed his fading, ling'ring rays, And when the twilight soft betrays, That day his course has run. 'Tis when the moon, far o'er the main, Sheds on the hill and smiling plain, Her pure, yet borrow'd beams; When some pale lover, wand'ring far, Beholds the bright Hesperian star, In fancy's golden dreams. 'Tis when the rais'd romantick mind, To friendship, peace, and heav'n resign'd, Loves dearly to repair To some sequester'd, fragrant grove, There wrapt in âby past timesâ to rove, Releas'd from studious care. 'Tis when the heavenly orbs serene, Divinely blend each rural scene, Of meadows, hills, and dales; When by their mild and tranquil light, From perfum'd groves the birds of night Descant their tender tales. 'Tis when the sentient, wounded heart, Pierced by slander's keenest dart, Press'd with unnumber'd woes, Flies from the âbusy humâ of day, In solitary walks to stray, And seek a soft repose. Dearly I love thy tranquil pow'r, No noon tide sun, no morning hour Can with thy charms compare; For e'en when sorrow swells my breast, Thine hour can soothe my soul to rest, And soften fell despair. Evening Now sunk in western cadence low, The lurid sun with gentler glow; And dusky shadows soft and slow, Steal on in dread solemnity. He looks the parting clouds between, And tips the hills with golden beam; Salutes the meadow's feeble stream, That winds along so tranquilly. With silv'ry banner, now unfurl'd, The moon, by myriad stars empearl'd, To light and cheer a weary world, Rolls on in splendid majesty. How sweet to muse upon the hill, And listen to the murm'ring rill, When hoarser sounds are hush'd and still, And all is soft serenity. How sweet to view the vault of heav'n, Chequer'd with countless stars at even;â 'Tis where we may, our sins forgiv'n, Soar to an Immortality. Pastoral Song. â(Written in June.) Come, Mary, come, the morning dawns, Fair streaks of lustre tinge the skies!â Come, let us rove the up-land lawns, And watch the early lark arise. And from the sweetly scented grove We'll listen to the ring-dove's tale, And watch the silver clouds above, As o'er the azure vault they sail. Our flocks, that on the meadows graze, Anon they range the verdant hills; But flee from noon's intenser blaze, And ramble round the limpid rills. Come, Mary, come, and bring thy lute, As evening shows her mantle grey; And join in concert, with my flute, A vesper of the departing day. Solitude Lone spirit of the silent shade, Inspiring Solitude, to meet Thy smile, along the moonlight glade, I'll turn my weary, wandering feet. No sprightly note on Echo calls, Nor gleams the west on golden streak; One fading leaf of Autumn falls To strew the path I often seek. Come, pensive spirit, come and bind My bosom with thy garland's dun; Come, cast thy gloom athwart my mind, And guide me where yon brooklets run. There, in the gloom of twilight's lay, I'll woo thee to some sylvan bower; And, as the fitful breezes play, I'll watch thy pensive, fading flower. Oft, as the silent evening sighs, And nature tir'd, is hush'd to sleep, Thou point'st to me yon starry skies, Where man shall smile, no more to weep. Still guide me to that heav'nly road, Where yon cerulean vapours twine; Which leads to truth, which leads to God, And peace, and joy, and Heav'n be mine. Stanzas To ???? Touch not againâtouch not again thy lyre! Forbear that melting strain! It will awake to life my bosom's fire, My heart will feel again;â That heart which once, with gentle flow, Felt all the joys that love could know. Enchanting thought, and joy and love were there, And Hope's delightful dreams: But Hope was falseâand cankering despair Dissolv'd each pleasing theme; What then my tortur'd breast befel, Forbear, O MEMORY, to tell. Touch not again thy lyreâmy heart's to passion dead, Nor fires my lukewarm mind; Its tort'ring pangs, its pleasures long have fled, And left a dream behind; Alike reliev'd from joy and pain, Reason again resumes her reign. Touch not againâtouch not again thy lyre! Forbear that hallow'd strain! Again forbear to wake my bosom's fire, O wound it not again! For he, whose spring-like years are o'er Can listen to its strains no more. To The Moon Sublime, emerging o'er the orient glade! Sublime, o'er clouds that lately veil'd her rays! The full-orb'd Moon comes forth with silv'ry blaze, To light the silent hours of night's dun shade. Queen of the night!âand now, by thy pale beam, Lonely and pensive I delight to stray, And mark the silver clouds, that cross thy way, Or watch thy shadow trembling in the stream. Now Autumn falls upon the languid sight, Now falling leaves bestrew the wand'rer's way; How doubly sweet to mark thy lucid ray Shoot through the misty figures of the night. And as I gaze upon thy pensive ray, A soft and tranquil calm pervades my soul; And oft I think, beyond where planets roll, The wretched there may find eternal day. Mild orb! that sailest thro' the realms of night, A pathless wand'rer o'er a lonely wild; Thou, in bright childhood's hour my thoughts beguil'dâ Thrice welcome now thy soft and tranquil light. Pale Moon! thou dost unto my mem'ry bring The pleasing scenes of youth's delightful hour: In thee I view, by thy enchanting pow'r, The smiles Favonian of life's earliest spring. Solitude Happy the man who lives retir'd, Far from the noisy scenes of life, Whose soul for honours never fir'd, Nor vex'd with strife. Whose utmost wish, whose utmost care âA few paternal acres bound;â Whose feeling heart gives comfort where Grief sits around. Thus free from care, from trouble free, âDays, months and years roll sweet away;â When life shall close, his spirit be In brightest day. A Valedictory Address, Delivered in the Bank Hall, Brattleboro' East Village, at the Quarterly Examination of Miss Peck's Select School. by Thomas Pickman Tyler,â(Aged Eight Years.) I dare to say you all do wonder How our good Ma'am, who is so wise, With taste so pure, and judgement nice, Shall commit so sad a blunder, As, 'gainst all reason, rhyme and rule, To make me mouthpiece of the School: Perhaps she thought that I might show How well her very worst might do; At any rate, shine or not shine, The praise, or blame, be hers, not mine. As for myself, in some snug corner, I'd rather sit, like brave Jack Horner, And with my thumb, like Jack so sly, Pluck out the plums from the Christmas pie; For in my mouth plums are much sweeter Than finest words of prose or metreâ But Ma'am commands, and I obey, For she holds here a sovereign sway; Shall I a little rebel prove, When govern'd by her law of love? Now, if your patience will prevail, Indulge me, and I'll tell a tale. âOh, dear Mama, pray let me see What you have in your hand for meâ Some almonds, raisins, nuts, or figs, Or peppermints, or sugar pigs?â Thus William to his mother said, As she her opening palm display'd, And show'd to his disgusted eyes Some shrivel'd things of dwarfish size, Dark as the sweepings of some room, Which long had mourn'd the absent broom. âI don't want them,â said pouting Will, âThey're neither fit for food or play, They look as bad as Doctor's pills, Do throw the dingy things away.â âPoor simple child,â Mamma replied, âKnow you despise the garden's pride; For from these shrivel'd dwarfish things, The glory of the garden springs: True, cast these seeds in the high way, And they no glory will display; But plant them in the garden fair, Beneath the gardener's fostering care, Nurtur'd and cultur'd, each will bloom And shed its richest, best perfume: Not he, so fam'd in scripture story, Great Solomon, in all his glory, Was ere so deck'd the eye to please, Or ere array'd like one of these: And Education is defined, The horticulture of the mind; The mental buds, by its kind care, Unfold their petals to the air, Prepar'd by bland instruction given, To shine on Earth or bloom in Heaven.â Thus ends my taleâand now I pray Let me apply it my own way. Kind Patrons, who here condescend Our exhibition to attend, Think not these benches now sustain Of Girls and Boys a simple train, But that within our classic bowers, You see a rich parterre of flowers, Of buds and blossoms, tendrilsâshoots, Springing from intellectual roots; Your fancies sure you need not strain, To change to flowers our female train. See Ellen there her bloom disclose, Say, is she not a blushing Rose? In sweet Sophia you may ken, A sister rose of the same stem, While in Miss Fanny's form you trace, The aspiring Tulip's airy grace; Her little namesake sure will tally, With the sweet Lily of the Valley. The China Aster's varied dye, Bright Sarah's mental powers imply, And in Elizabeth we view, The snowy Lily's Virgin hue; The golden Panza, may, I fancy, Portray our modest, pensive Nancy; In fair Calista's beauteous face, We may the bright Carnation trace; In graceful Helen's air you see, The very Pink of courtesy: Do you the Rose of Sharon prize, On our Lucretia cast your eyes; Would the pale Serenga seek, Mark gentle Anna's snowy cheek; The Amaranthus well may be, Sweet little Gurtrude named for thee; And sure the gay, sweet scented Pea, May tipify fair Emily. Our Marys too, as bright a knot As ever deck'd a maiden's bower; One is Jonquil, a Snow drop one, And one a lovely, sweet wild flower. Elizabethâher sister Jane, Are buds that one day will expand: Soon as their spring is on the wane, They'll bloom the glory of the land. Sweet Lucy is a bright Moss-pink, As ever flash'd its tints before ye, And Henrietta is, I think You'll all allow, a Morning Glory. Our bright Eliza, I'll not name, But rather wish you'd tax your powers, Provided you with care select Her emblem from the fairest flowers. In our cold, bleak and northern air, We have few flowers that may compare With sweet Belinda's speaking face, Or Harriet's form, or Julia's grace. There is a fine, attractive flower, By botanists called Mignionette, Which I pronounce, by fancy's power, Shall give the name to Mariette. Come, Maia, from thy sylvan bowers, Queen of gay tints and frolic fanciesâ Come, bring thy best bo[u]quette of flowers, The finest type for brilliant Frances. Yet there's one favorite, pretty Miss, Whose given name I've most forgot; But you may find her out by this, Her Lin[n]ean nameâForget-me-not. Perhaps within our flowery set, You'll ask, if we have not some Nettâ Noânoânot Nettles, that's not right; We have no plants so impolite. Perchance we have, if you require, Some pretty sprigs of Sweet, Sweet-briar. But what are then you boysâyou'll cry, Have you no flowers to name them by? Why boys, as boys, are well enough, And you may call us Garden Stuff; For if with our associates fair, You should for once us boys compare, Besides the jonquil, pink, and rose, We dwindle toâPotatoe Blows. Now if within our Garden fair You find aught lovely, good or rare, To our Instructress give the praise; Our dear Instructress crown with Bays For to her kind, judicious care, We gratefully owe all we are. Nor would we now forget what's due Most Honored Patroness to you, To nurse these buds to opening flowers, Needs genial suns, and fostering showers: All these your favor has supply'd,â To you we owe our garden's pride, You have the seeds of science sown And when in life our buds are blown. Thenâthen, we'll own the gen'rous deeds, And bless the hand which sow'd the seeds. And now, kind friends, I pray excuse My falterings and my stammersâ Respectfully I take my leave, And so I make my manners. The Chestnut Tree Misshapen seed! thy uncouth form, Thy rough exterior, sombre dye, Provoke the careless gazer's scorn Who notes thy worth, with tasteless eye. Not thus discerns the truly wise; He sees a prouder day for thee; And in thy homely garb espies The embrio of a mighty tree. Within my grass plots, scanty bound, In autumn day I'll bury thee; There shalt thou lie in sleep profound, Till winter's surly gloom shall flee. And soon shall quick'ning Spring prevail, And Maia spread her splendid bow, And April breath her tepid gale, And vegetation's pulse shall flow. Nature her genial trump shall blow, And bid her torpid children rise; The parent voice the slumberers know, And spring rejoicing to the skies. Thou too, within thy sombre crust, Shalt hear the summons to appear: Thy homely sarcophagus bust And break the clod, and climb the air. And I will nurse thy infant days And tend thee with a gardener's care, Protect thee from the sun's fierce rays, And fence thee from the noxious air. The oft returning summer's sun, Imagination well can see, Will foster thee, till thou become Pride of my plot! a stately tree. But oh! before that day appears, Where will thy early friend abide? Can mortal hope at sixty years To see thee in thy day of pride? He, who thy destiny can steer, As whim or mere caprice incline, Thy latent spark of life can cheer, Or cast thee to the grov'ling swine. He, long before thy day of might, E're yet thy midmost branches shoot, Shall seek the grave's long darksome night Mould'ring in dust beneath thy root. Whilst thou! aspiring in thy strength, Shall rear thy giant stock on high, Wave thy broad branches' mighty length, And time, and stormy winds defy. Sad is the page of scripture truth! âMan's like a flower, and dies as soon;â A century but compleats thy youth, And added centuries see thee bloom. But see! the sorceress Fancy's nigh, Whose witch'ries oft have truth belied, And from immense reality Have lur'd my truant thoughts aside. The sylph like gypsey lifts the veil, And future times are clearly seen; Her mimic crayons seldom fail With rainbow tints to paint the scene. She bids me now the landscape view Where all futurity appears; To look the lapse of ages through; The vista of two hundred years. Misshapen seed!âaye now I see The glories of thy future hour! See thee surmount each rival tree, And scale the vast Cathedral tower. For Hope has Fancy's pencil got, Portray'd the Church and built the tower, And pointed out the future spot Of Faith and Apostolic power. Misshapen seedâI see again The future honors to thee paid: I see approach the unborn train Who shelter in thy grateful shade. I see the Dogstar's sultry reign, I see it pour its fervid ray; Scorch the fresh verdure of the plain, And shed âIntolerable day.â I see the languid groups repair, With lagging steps o'erpress'd with heat; All shun the pond'rous, noxious air, Beneath thy shady cool retreat. Matron and sire, and girl and boy, The Village's distant progeny, The dashing belle, and maiden coy, All seek their fav'rite Chestnut Tree. The ancient maid and widowed dame To mourn their sad drear lonesome fate; The frolic boy to sport his game, And reverend age to meditate. Bevies of beauty now display In all the pride of dress and bloom, The tasty robe, or headgear gay, Oft changing like the inconstant moon. And as the promenade he views Of fair or brown or bright brunette, The Ensign smart his files reviews, And sports his spangled epaulette. For soldiers then, like soldiers now, Will oft attract sweet beauty's eye, And war his conquering crest shall bow, And at the feet of beauty sigh. And there the student musing roves; And business plods, on gain intent; And his worn limbs tired labour moves; And usury counts his cent per cent. For underneath thy spreading shade All casts of characters are seen, As if some theatre display'd Life's varied, shifting, empty scene. And do but mark that polish'd beau; See him gallant that stylish fair; Pinks of the future mode, who show The coming fashion's taste and air. And now he bows; she smiles a bow, Affects to blush, pretends to frown, Bridles her dimpled chin, and shows She reigns the toast of half the town. And now he twirls his glove or cane, And whispers nothings in her ear; Whilst she repulses with disdain The flatt'ries; which she loves to hear. For ah! what age has yet passed by? What future age does yet remain? When sage experience shall deny That belles coquet, and beaux will feign? Muslins and mind, clear starched, and prim Erect in step and head and air, All apprehension, fear and whim, There walk the future prudish fair. See how the obsequious beaux present Her dropt boquet, or fallen fan; While she recedes, as to prevent The upas touch of naughty man. And affectation too is there; See how her pretty bosom heaves, Support her beaux, the swooning fair Is frightened by the falling leaves! So timid, soft, and delicate, The interesting puppet seems; Thy eddying leaves such fears create, She falters, faints, and diesâand screams. Hark! what loud laughter's giggling tones Make the grave smile, and prudish stare? The village Hoyden bouncing comes, With skip, and jump, and heedless air. I know her by her tatter'd vest, Her unkempt hair and ink-stained glove; Yes, 'tis that romping, tricksey pest, Whom all must love, and none approve. Boldly she climbs thy mossy side, And seeks a seat, regardless how, Like German dames who palfreys ride, She swings upon thy waving bough. But see, that lively laughing throng; What can have touch'd the merry crowd? They view the pictures that belong To an old book, and laugh aloud. What is the title? let me spy:â What pictures those which look so queer? It is âThe Ladies' Diaryâ With fashions for the present year. Some virtuoso, grave and shrewd, This toilet relic has bestow'd, And in the Twentieth Century shew'd Of the Nineteenth the grotesque mode. Our Leghorn straws, and bear skin muffs And all our dashy modes of dress, They view, as we the blue starch'd ruffs Of Scottish James and old Queen Bess. Again they look, and laugh again; Then peep, and smile, and giggling stare; And all their lovely lips exclaim, âWhat monstrous frights our grandames were!â And now the sicklied tribe surrounds Thy trunk to catch the balmy air; His hollow cough the hectic sounds; And dropsey's bloated bulk is there. There hypochondria starts alarm'd; And palsy shakes his drooping head; And gout with crutch and flannel arm'd Falters his agonising tread. Corroding cancer, ague chill, Consumption, with her flatt'ring bloom, And many an untold human ill, Which darken life and crowd the tomb. From age to age, as time shall flee, Such is the doom of Providence: Disease and pain and death shall be Heirlooms of man's inheritance. But who are those two scowling wights, With sneering nostrils, ruffled brow? Who seem to compliment in spite, And threaten vengeance while they bow. Associates by the dying bed, Familiar with disease and pain; Sure sad lessons daily read Their petty bick'rings might restrain. Must learn'd Physicians always jar? Their science, spite, and skill display? I had well hoped this wordy war Would cease before that distant day. The troubled eye turns with delight From this degrading, senseless scene, And gratifies the ravish'd sight, With the next couple on the green. For arm in arm they loving walk, Engaged in converse sweet and bland; While jest, and smile, and courteous talk Make their confiding hearts expand. Sure they are brethren whose sad fate Has sever'd them for many a year; Or well tried friends, with joy elate To meet their long lost inmates here. And yet, a little hour since, These friends engaged in verbose war; With mimic raging eloquence Were wrangling at the noisey bar. Ah cunning elves! ye know that strife Your interest, honor, bliss impede; Fast friends in walks of social life, And only foes, when richly fe'd. Then too shall vice pollute thy shade And stalking Folly idly roam; What scene so fair has nature made Where vice and folly will not come? But listen to those deep-drawn groans, Those gnashing teeth, that frenzied tread; The ruin'd Gamester there bemoans His fortune, fame, and pleasure fled. And as Despair, with ghastly grin, Suggests that death his ills may close, The wily tempter shows the limb Where he may end his galling woes. While fashion's vot'ries flaunting rove, And wave their jaunty plumes on high, See there that simple Quak'ress move, Arresting each contrasting eye. Why does her dove-dyed habit plain, Her untrimm'd bonnet white as snow, Rob garish fashion of its claim, And rival slattern beauty too? 'Tis neatness! love's attractive lure Enthralls each heart and chains each eye; And female grace and manners pure, And sweet retiring modesty. In russet garments, beaver brown, Beside her stalks her sober spouse, And eyes with pride perhaps unknown, The costly dress her sect allows. All vanity he disapproves; No toilet arts on him intrude; But firm in noiseless faith he moves, And stiff in moral rectitude. The decent, prim, new married pair Calmly pursue their silent walk; Nor vainly wound the tortur'd air, With noisy mirth, or idle talk. In hearts so temperate, habits calm, Can loveâimpassion'd love reside? Can its all cheering flame ere warm The sober bridegroom, placid bride? Yes! these cold hearts with love will glow; For love is no sectarian prim; And heads that hold it sin to bow, Will, with great reverence, bow to him. A household God is nuptial love; His Lares shun the public gaze; In home's own hearth, and dear alcove, His incense burns, his altars blaze. With throbbing temples, filmy eye, With cheeks now flush'd, now deadly pale, The beastly drunkard staggers by, And taints with burning breath the gale. Wife, children, friends, and parents dear, Health, wealth, and character forgot; All that makes life a blessing here; Sunk in the filthy, driv'ling sot. Ah worse than madnessâthe insane His reason fled, has guiltless died; But reason, conscience, both disclaim Thy wilful, lingering suicide. Oft, in inebriation's hour, Reason, the faint resolve shall form; Oft conscience, with decreasing power, Shall prompt, and aid thy brief reform. Alas! how weak the vain control Of reason, conscience, over sin! Still thou wilt quaff the poison'd bowl, Tho' Death flits hov'ring o'er its brim. So, where old oceans' surges beat, The flooding tide its purpose gains; Oft with receding wave retreats, Then deluges the ruin'd plains. And now upon thy beaten soil, See, there the boisterous youngsters come; Lads of the village, sons of toil, Whose weekly drudgery is done. With shout and rout the roistering throng Enjoy the hour of parting day, And haul and drive their mates along To join the rude athletic play. Some join the football's noisy war; Or the sly wrestler's art they try; Run, leap, or pitch the massy bar; Or send the bounding ball on high. All hallowed be your manly sport: On you your Country's hopes abide; In peace the Union's sure support, In war, the nation's strength and pride. With rod elastic, silken line, The patient angler joins the rout, And holds on high, with pride sublime, A glorious string of speckled trout. With fond prolixity he tells How oft he trudg'd the sedgy brook, How oft in vain he tried his spells, His bobbing cork, and baited hook. How, where the current rippled by, When the rain patter'd from the skies, He, with his well selected fly, Troll'd, play'd and caught the finny prize. Sure, since the golden age refin'd, There never yet to man was sent Such solace for a vacant mind,â As vanity so innocent. But hark! that mimic thunder's sound! And from thy loftiest, trembling spray, The robin flutt'ring meets the ground, And bleeds his little life away. Thy feather'd partner seeks in vain His murder'd mate with roving wing; In vain the unfledg'd nestlings plain For food the parent bill should bring. Ah cruel sportsman! deed unbless'd! Could not thy victim's vesper song Or varied plumage of his breast, His summer day of life prolong? But note that haggard motleid crew, Parents and children, ragged troop, Who the gay scene with envy view And seem to curse each well-dress'd group. Some manufactory's fetid walls Have cast the impoverish'd wanderers forth, Deaf to humanity's loud calls, To want, to beggary, and to sloth. Within those walls, from day to day, The same unvarying task they sped, To watch the rapid spindles play, And join th' attenuated thread. Their scanty wages through the year Scarcely gaunt hunger's pangs assuage, While each sad labouring day draws near To penury and neglected age. Bereft of education there, Their offspring prove the land's disgrace, While tatter'd garments, meagre fare, Stunt and deform the starv'ling race. Ah barbarous system! cruel trade; By art infernal sure design'd At once to torture and degrade, To starve the body and the mind. Some new machine's ingenious art The laborer's tardy work supplies, Or o'erstocked market's glutted mart Their wonted task to them denies. By the hard hand of gain outcast, To vice or beggary they flee; On the humane their mis'ries cast, Or the Town's cruel charity. To madness, by their wretched fate, By hunger, sickness, suff'ring, driven, They bawl sedition 'gainst the state, And curse the ways of righteous Heaven. Blest be our age! and blest our Land! Whom yet no scenes so foul degrade And blest the Statesmen, whose firm band This plague of avarice, has stay'd. But what arrests each eager eye, Fixes and strains the aching sight? While some with prospect glass espy The neigh'bring mountain's rocky height. See how they view each jutting rock, The deep ravines where woodbines creep, Point where a panting party stop Or scramble up the craggy steep. To gather berries, autumn's pride, Or to inhale a purer air, A youthful party climb its side To take their swelt'ring pleasure there. As up the sinuous path they strain, The lowly gazer's eye they mock, Now half expos'd, then hid again, By ledge or bush or shelving rock. In toil's most vivid healthy hue The breathless Nymphs attain the height, And stand, like roses pearl'd with dew, Upon the mountain's loftiest site. On the brisk gale, as rob'd in white, Their filmy vestures fluttering blow, Each seems some lovely airy sprite, Or dazz'ling wreath of mountain snow. Heard ye, upon the mountain gale, That anguish'd scream its thrill impart? Cries of distress the ear assail; The shriek of horror palls the heart! The affrighted fair one sees, or hears The rattle of the vengeful snake; The anxious beau, to calm the fears, Shows rustling leaves, or sun-dried brake. And now the cheerful group descend, With sliding step the slip'ry mount; And to each pleas'd, admiring friend The wonders of their tour recount. Point out the lofty, giddy height Which their proud footsteps did attain; Whence men, to their astonish'd sight, Seem'd pigmies on the prostrate plain. Tell what fatigues they underwent To climb the pinnacle on high; And how the envious bramble rent The lace, or shoe bow's silken tie. How they approach'd the crater dire, Which once poured forth its lavaed flame, And only lacks old Etnea's fire To rival its tremendous fame. Tell how they view'd the silver mine, Whose treasures man's research defies, And how the beaux' attentions shine More precious in a lady's eyes. Ah, lovely trav'lers! chatter still; That sprightly voice, that wond'ring look, With more delight the heart will fill, Than many a learned voyager's book. With clouted sandals, raiment mean, Bow'd down with pain, and grief, and years, Sad sample of life's chequer'd scene, A female pauper now appears. Her coarse attire, with darns replete, The extreme of wretchedness displays; But yet, her manners mild bespeak That she has seen far better days. For when her wants are still supplied, By those who know her piteous case, The hectic flush of wounded pride Will tinge her wither'd, pallid face. And if perchance some sav'ry scrap, Among the broken meat appears, It brings the days of plenty back; She steeps the morsel with her tears. For she was once a farmer's wife, Possessed of house and full stor'd barn, And in the pride of rural life Was mistress of a well stock'd farm. And erst upon her ample board Her rural danties oft she spread, And from her well replenish'd hoard, The frequent guest her bounty fed. She, there, display'd her huswife state; There, were her snow white napkins seen; Her rich preserves, and sugar'd cake; Her tarts, her custards and her cream. Industrious, frugal, night or noon, Her huswife skill her household share, Still at the distaff, or the loom, Or the full dairy's toilsome care. And she was charitable too, And oft reliev'd the neighb'ring poor, And should the impoverish[ed] trav'ler sue, He went not empty from her door. At one âfell swoop,â by fate adverse, Her earthly bliss in ruin lies; To sadden more the dire reverse, Her bankrupt husband droops and dies. Now houseless, friendless, hopeless, poor, Too old to work, asham'd to beg, She craves a pittance from the store Of those her former bounty fed. The flinty town but ill supply The dainties sicklied age should share; Life's comforts they too oft deny And grudge and stint her meagre fare. The patient sufferer waits resigned, 'Till life's sad sorrowing scene shall close; Hopes in the peaceful grave to find Oblivion of her shame and woes. For early piety has taught Her mind above the world to rise, And faith, with gospel promise fraught Shows rest and joy beyond the skies. Neat as new pins our ladies are, And essenced with Olympian dew, See that old beau come simp'ring there, Stale bachelor of forty two. A busy castle builder he, Constructing scenes of married life; The gay day dreamer hopes to see His blooming, tasty, wealthy wife. As age comes on with rapid stride, Furrows his brow, and thins his hair, He dreams of a more peerless bride More wealthy, tasty, and more fair. The blooming girls of early life, Whose maiden graces oft he woo'd, Have each become a happy wife, Or bless'd in vestal maidenhood. With beardless boys, and girls in teens, His idle hours he idly spends; Acts o'er the same unmeaning scene, Which once amused their matron friends. Pause, senseless dreamer! think the years Of age, flit fast in life's decline; Nor friseur's comb, nor taylor's shears Arrest the ravages of time. Soon you'll suspect the quizzing leer, The laugh suppressed by youth in bloom, And stripling's wit, and beauty's sneer Will scout thee from the drawing-room. Where wilt thou, when thy manhood's flown, Thy isolated being hide? Thine is no comfortable home, No sweet domestic fire side. No long loved wife, with anxious care, Consults thy taste, thy woes beguile; No manly sons thy name shall bear, No daughters soothe with filial smile. When deafness, blindness, grief and pain Mark life's last, lingering wintry stage, Say, who shall aid thee to sustain The wayward cares of fitful age? True, sordid gold from hireling hands May wring involuntary aid, But the lone heart in age demands What hoarded treasures never paid. It asks the unbidden step of Love To watch the couch with silent tread; The uncall'd hand the folds to smooth, And pillow soft the weary head. It seeks of Love the patient ear To hear garrulity's dull tale; Affection's lips to sweetly cheer The flagging spirits as they fail. It asks, and it should richly share, In sweet, domestic, calm repose; And for that precious filial care, Which love alone on age bestows. Ah what avails to strike the lyre To the deaf ear with hopes to please? Or to the dozing, torpid friar To cast the pearls of nuptial ease? But note that interesting pair, With married bliss and love elate; While each sustains, with constant care, That lisping infant's tottering gait. The father's glance, the mother's eye, Mark how its tiny footsteps move, And nature shews the stander by It is their youngest pledge of love. Their eldest boy, upon the plain, Sports with the fairy school dame throng, And gaily rides the father's cane, Or drives the whirling hoop along. Father of mercies! sure thy love The pristine curse did thus assuage, And made our rising offspring prove Our joy in youth, our prop in age! With polished air, in habit plain, See there that graceful matron move, Attended by her comely train, Pledges of youthful widow'd love. With wealth, and taste and beauty blest, She liv'd, a happy, youthful wife, Born to adorn, as all confest The brilliant scenes of city life. Her taste, amusements all give place; To the rude village scene confin'd, She quits of life the polish'd grace, To train to worth the infant mind. Daughters of Fashion! ye who glide In joy's frail skiff on pleasure's stream, And daily quaff the dulcet tide, And sparkle through the tinsell'd scene, Can the assemblies' bounding train? Cards, rout, or ball, or Thespian play? Or Oratorio's lofty strain? Such solace to the heart convey? As when the widow'd mother views Her lovely, rising orphan race, Sweet girls, and boys whose form renews The mother's charms, the father's face; Oft in some solitary hour Would cruel memory call forth, With heartless, agonizing power, Remembrance of a husband's worth; Oft memory paint the bed of death, The last embrace, the feeble tone, The clammy brow, the short'ning breath, The dying look, the latest groan; That parting look, which seem'd to say, âProtect these children of my care, Quit the vain pleasures of the day, Let all the mother centre there.â âYes, sainted spirit! I devote The time, the talents to me given, To make them all that thou canst hope To see on earth, or meet in heaven.â Who is that meagre, studious wight, Who sports the habit of our days? And in the reigning mode's despite His antique coat and vest displays? In whose gaunt form from head to feet The antiquarian's air we trace, While Hebrew roots, and uncial Greek Plot out the features of his face. His critic eye is fix'd with glee On a worm-eaten, smoak dried page, The time worn paper seems to be The relic of some long past age. In sooth! it is the manuscript Of this poor feeble verse of mine, Which in despite of taste and wit Has straggled down to future time. The Bookworm's features scrawl a smile While gloating on the musty page; As we admire some ruined pile, Not for its worth, but for its age. The sprawling letters, yellow text, The formal phrase, the bald stiff style, The spelling quaint, the line perplext, Provoke his unaccustom'd smile. Like Kennicott he cites and quotes, On illustration clear intent; And in the margin gravely notes A thousand meanings, never meant. Perhaps some studious young divine May study oft beneath thy bough, Ambitious in his day to shine, Like our Right Reverend Bishop now. In early dawn, or silent noon, When fops and giggling girls are rare, He'll quit the fever'd study's room, And bring his fav'rite volume there. Some author of Rome's classic age, Or mitred Father's pious line, Which like great Raphael's pictured page Blends human art with things divine. Some writer whose bright sterling worth Through the dark rust of age appears, Like racy wine of generous growth; Grown racier by a lapse of years. Some long departed letter'd sage Whose work does taste and truth impart; Whose chastely, classic, pious page Refines the taste and mends the heart. And as the polished periods flow, And wisdom's richest boons dispense, The wondering student learns to know The charms of pulpit eloquence. While reverence, love, his heart inflame, He seeks to know the author sage, And reads inscribed, thy Donor's name Right Reverend on the title page. On that commanding southern mound From whence the embosom'd hamlet's seen, A pensive party quit the round Of pleasure, for Death's solemn scene. And now the grave yard's turf they tread, Its devious paths they sorrowing wend, And seek among the assembled dead The graves of lover, kindred, friend. The mould'ring tombs, and stones decay'd The monitory thoughts create, As if some herald art display'd Quaint emblems of life's crumbling state. The pensive party gather round, And fix the mournful eye intent, Where the dispointed stones surround A tott'ring, ruin'd monument. A fallen tablet moulders near, Broken, defac'd, begrim'd with scurf The shattered fragments now appear, Half hidden by the encroaching turf. Tho' the frail tablet's broken line The honored tenent's name denies, They know that here embalmed by time The earliest village pastor lies. For they have heard their fathers tell What their forefathers told to them, And fond tradition knows full well, The story of the best of men. That what of good, or kind, or true, Of morals pure, and faith unfeign'd, Which his adopted village knew, His precepts taught, his life explain'd. And they still read the warning page Address'd to long departed youth; Still learn from Israel's youthful sage To honor God, and prize the Truth. The sculptur'd marble strives in vain, Vain Egypt's spicy cerements prove, The sure embalmers of man's fame, Are talents, learning, Christian love. Now the moon brightens all the green, Pours her mild beams amidst thy boughs, And in the checker'd shade are seen Two youthful lovers sighing vows. Vows of eternal love and truth, Which time or fate can ne'er destroy, Love sparkling with perpetual youth, Which ne'er will fade, and ne'er can cloy. Ah simple, happy heedless pair! May no dense cloud of sober truth, Shadow thy prospects, or impair The transient spring time of thy youth. Ye heed not now how quick, how soon, The youthful heart may swerve or range; And like that glittering lovely moon Is prone to wane, and apt to change. But cease, my muse, this childish lay; To thee can fancy's toys belong? My furrow'd brow, and tresses gray Are ill suited to the idle song. When ardent youth crown'd life's gay scene I could bright Fancy's dreams create, And from a stubborn flinty theme, The flickering sparks could scintillate. My ebbing mind and troubled head Both bid me cease the poet's strains; Invention's gone, and fancy fled, And naught but chiming rhyme remains. In this vain, airy, shadowy scene Is there no moral which appears, No sage reflection to be seen, More suited to my waning years? Faith!âHoly Faith! and Hope sublimed! Point to the apostolic page, There in the âburied seedâ to find, Meet subject for reflecting age. Misshapen seed! I too, like thee Shall in our parent earth be cast, And with new life shall quicken'd be When the grave's wintry season's past. For man, the awak'ning trump shall sound, âThe Sun of Righteousnessâ arise; The human seed shall burst the ground, And mount immortal to the skies. O! may I then, like that fair tree, Erst by the inspir'd Exile seen; By crystal waters planted be, And nurtur'd by the living stream. Removed to that celestial clime, From the world's follies and its care; And like that tree of Life Divine, Bloom in Immortal verdure there.

[Fragment III] Julian. Antonius. Julian. Antonius, 'tis said that you, even you, My bosom friend, the bravest of my generals, Before whose conquering arm the barbarous Gaul, And late victorious children of the Sun Have fled disheartenedâthat you, even you, Have bowed before that impious Nazarene Whose dastard followers dare despise the Gods Yet shrink dismayed &amp; trembling from the field Of victory or death. Ant. My Lord, 'tis true. Your once proud general fears to draw the sword, And kneels before that lowly Nazarene, Yet feels more proud, more highly priviledged Than when he basked in royal Julian's favor And led your conquering legions on to battle. Julian. Antonius, It ill becomes your Sov'reign &amp; your judge To hold familiar converse with a thing So fallen as thou art. But the softening charm Of former friendship, &amp; the glorious record Of thy heroic deeds, have brought me here, That my persuasion, condescending mercy May do what torture cannot do, &amp; lead you back From loathsome dungeons &amp; the verge of death To honor &amp; to life. Renounce this mad impiety This frenzied desperation, &amp; every gift Which royalty can heap on fortune's favorite, Riches, honor, beauty, all are yoursâ Reject my favorâ&amp; a raging multitude, Who cry for vengeance on your guilty head, Shall soon be gratified. Ant. That raging multitude Shall find me ready, The follower of Jesus dans [deigns] to scorn your Gods And shrinks from fields of carnage. Yet my Lord, The Christian martyr does not fear to die. He meets your fiercest tortures with a smile, And 'mid his glorious death-pangs breathes a prayer That He who rules on high will pardon you. Julian. This is th' extreme of folly. It cuts me to the very heart, Antonius, To see your noble nature so degraded. To hear you spurn the gifts of fortune, &amp; traduce The immortal Gods whose favoring auspices Have led the Roman eagle on to conquests. Ant. My Lord, hear me. You will remember when by your command A band of Christians here were massacred. Julian. Aye, our violated Gods, &amp; oft insulted fanes Enjoyed a sweet revenge. Ant. By your command, my trusty legions stood To guard your royal person from assault. When gathering thousands thronged the market place. Julian. And 'twas a glorious sight, Antonius, To see my loyal subjects crowd to view The fearful vengeance of the Gods. Ant. The Christians came, led by a pale old man, Whose mild blue eye, &amp; calm majestic pace, Bespoke a mind at peace. He blest me as he passed. There followed on a melancholy trainâ Matrons, &amp; youth, &amp; feeble tottering age, The manly stride, &amp; fair-pained beauty's step, Moved slowly round &amp; round the broard [sic] arena. As their sweet hymn to Jesus rose to heaven Amid the deafening shouts of countless multitudes. My Savage heart rejoiced, rejoiced to think How soon an ignominious death would stop That low, &amp; solemn Song. Julian. You once were worthy of the name of Roman. Ant. First died a venerable man, whose hoary head Was whitened by the past of ninety years. His aged limbs assumed a momentary strength, As if to meet the death he loved &amp; coveted. Next came a sturdier man. I knew him well. I had seen him foremost in the ranks of war The first to scale, to plunder, to destroy; I had seen him drive his furious javelin Through mother's heart, &amp; hurl her helpless babe Among devouring flames, &amp; here he stood Calm as an unruffled lake, &amp; peaceable As lamb for Sacrifice. He diedâ A pale &amp; beautious maiden followed next, She raised her meek &amp; radiant eyes to heaven, Then bowed her ivory neck to meet her death, Calm as an infant's slumbersâThey diedâall diedâ Calling upon God to pardon &amp; to change The savage hearts that murdered them. My Lord, my heart was softened. From that hour I longed to die as they did. I longed to find That inward peace, that sweet, &amp; heavenly calm, Which shone so brightly round the martyr's blockâ I soughtâI foundâ&amp; now my Lord, I gladly go, And yield my life before that raging populace, A witness for the truth I once despised. Jul. Your hardenned guilt shall meet its due reward. Prepare to dieâTomorrow's Sun shall view the fate Of him who dares to brave the Gods, &amp; spurn The proffered mercy of his King. Ant. I thank you, &amp; tomorrow's glorious Sun Shall see me joying in the death you [give?] me. Jul. The fiercest tortures which inventive malice Has e'er devised shall tell th' immortal Gods And all assembled Ephesus, my deadly hate To all which bear the name of Christian. Ant. Wrapped in the mantel of my Savior's love I scorn your Gods, your tortures, &amp; your wrath. The light which beams from heaven can brightly cheer The darkest scenes of earthly miseryâ Can make the circling flames more soft, more dear Than young affection's fond embrace, more sweet Than beauty's bowerâ Jul. Unhappy man! I leave you to your fate. Ant. My Lord, farewell! &amp; when the lowly Nazarene Shall stand triumphant mid dissolving worlds May we then meet in Safety, &amp; in Joyâ FOUR POEMS IN MANUSCRIPT A Love Song By the fierce flames of Love I'm in a sad taking, I'm singed like a pig that is hung up for bacon, My stomach is scorched like an over-done mutton-chop, That for want of gravy wont afford a single drop. Love, love, love is like a dizziness, Wont let a poor man go about his business My great toes and little toes are burnt to a cinder, As a hot burning-glass burns a dish-cloth to tinder, As cheese by a hot salamander is roasted, By beauty that's red-hot, like a cheese am I toasted. Love, love, love is like a dizziness, Wont let a poor man go about his business. Attend all young lovers, who after ladies dandle, I'm singed like a duck's foot over a candle, By this that and t'other, I'm treated uncivil, Like a gizzard I'm peppered, and then made a devil. Love, love, love is like a dizziness, Wont let a poor man go about his business. âSay Is It Height or Shape or Airâ Say is it height or shape or air, That to the mind true grace impart, Can brilliant eyes, can flowing hair, Can grace external win the heart? If height gives worth, the flowers in vain O'er blooming fields their sweets disclose, The thorn excels fair Maia's train The lofty yew excels the rose. If graceful shape can worth impart The tiger's graceful form must please, The deadly adder's taper shape, Declares her worthier than the bees. If graceful movements claim applause The savage beasts our praise may claim While blood distains the lion's jaws Who moves more graceful o'er the plain? If brilliant eyes true merit claim, Or flowing ringlets worth possess, The serpent's eye, the lion's mane, Look brilliant and show gracefulness. Since neither height, nor shape, nor air, Nor grace external worth impart, What ornaments must be my care? How shall I deck my youthful heart? Far nobler graces I'll pursue, Which reptiles, flowers and beasts don't share, Fair knowledge, opening to the view Is truly great and truly fair. To Providence in all resigned, My heart shall glow with gratitude, With meekness I'll adorn my mind, And to me lovely, I'll be good. Hers is by far the happiest case, Whose mental beauties are her care, They give to homeliness a grace And e'en the fairest make more fair. Gambling Of every vice pursued by those In folly's by-paths rambling, There's none so bad in its dread close, As the vile vice of gambling. It taints our morals, wastes our time And fills us with vexation. Destroys our wealth and youthful prime, And mars our reputation. Yet I'll aver, with my own eyes, And I am not called stupid, I caught sweet Fanny by surprise A gambling with young Cupid! Beneath the silent moon's soft beams In fragrant flowery arbor, That noted gambling house it seems, Where players love to harbor. The cunning god and simple fair, Sat down to play at leisure And staked such sums as might impair A mighty monarch's treasure. And first they played for locks of hair And Fanny won the game. Then cheeks and lips &amp; skin so fair Her luck was all the same. Vex'd by the maid to be outdone Then Cupid made a high bet, Stak'd all his smilesâa mighty sum With dimples for a by-bet. But still she won, &amp; Cupid crost Made dreadful sad grimaces, Not only his own smiles he lost, But all his mother's graces. Proud Fanny's air and looks and eyes Of victory gave token, Her winnings seemed a noble prize, A bank not to be broken. Beware sweet girl and go no more To midnight arbors rambling, But think how soon you may deplore, The dreadful end of gambling. Sly Cupid has but played the knave, And let you come off winner; This is the way all gamblers have, With every new beginner. Some sharper soon will with you sport, By Cupid's malice sent hence, Win all your winnings and leave naught, But sorrow and repentance. Fragment of a Religious Poem May he whose presence fills The beauteous scenes around, Valleys and hills, Green woods, and arching skies, Whose hand hath made them all Dwell in these humble walls; Our Maker, God. Here may the minds of youth Successfully receive Lessons of Death; Enter the pleasant paths Of wisdom's perfect way, And walk in them each day. Our Teacher, God. Grant, in thy plenteous grace, That this, the rising race, Be brothers all. O raise them up to be Friends of humanity, And children worthy Thee Our Father, God. Save all who here resort, Guard them in deed and thought From evil's power. When earthly tasks are done Receive them in thy love, To higher schools above, Our Savior, God. âThe Bay Boyâ Chapter Heading Verses [He was a man of passing merit] [In relation to the parish minister:] He was a man of passing merit Imbued with the true Christian spirit With meekness, candour, charity The fruits of Genuine Piety. His Sunday's precepts you might seek In his examples thro' the weekâ His daily conduct seemed to teach This is the sum of what I preach. His faith and works you might discover Reflected light on one another And shewed his flock a saint like picture Worth Folios huge of notes on Scripture. [Oh happy he, whose mind is richly stored] [In relation to a young school teacher:] Oh happy he, whose mind is richly stored With Science. He who proudly nobly scorns Basely to barter intellectual wealth For fame.âBut on the uncultured soil Of youthful minds, his mental treasure pours Profusely.âOn him like flowerets, moistened And refreshed by vernal showers, the young Shall smile; and the delighted Parents pay Their debt of gratitude, with ceaseless praise. The Path of the Pedagogue. By the Author. [To fall in LoveâI hate the phrase] To fall in LoveâI hate the phrase 'Tis so ignoble, flat and base. When I am touched by Cupid's flambeau[u]x Which oft will make both belle and Man go, When that shy gunner of the graces His lint stock tipped with pretty faces, Lights his gay torch at some bright eye And whirls his flaming port-fire high And then applys the hottest part To the gun-powder of my heart Then may I bounce, and hiss, and fly Like Congreve-rocket through the sky; And if the Fair unyielding prove And I go hang myself for Love; Howe'er the gentle passions end Let me not fall, but still ascend. Doggerel Romaunt. By the Author. [The Zephyrs fear to breathe. The Morning gales] The Zephyrs fear to breathe. The Morning gales Flit o'er the dewy flowers, with noiseless wing; The early birds chirp forth their matin song With modulated cadence; while the bright God of day restrains his panting steeds, lest With their sparkling houghs they trampling beat Their sap[p]hire path with rude concussion. Now all above, beneath, around, is quiet Peace and holy rest. The Sabbath comes. (Sunday in Boston in the year 17â) [Upon the pantry's luscious shelves] Upon the pantry's luscious shelves Have you not seen those whisker'd elves, The felon mice, with gormand nibble Amidst the huswives' dainties piddle Now sip the cream, now knaw the cheese Now rove from syllabub to pease, Now climb the wheaten loaf on high, Or burrow in an apple pieâ Still on the furtive sweets repleting As if they thought life made for eating. But e'er they close their stolen dinners Sly Puss, the dread of four leg'd sinners, With tail erect and fiery eye, Pounces among the nibbling fry: No more on stolen sweets they riot Each seeks his hole and all is quiet. So when the Magistrate Gramalkin On municipal grandeur stalking, Comes purring forth with rampant paws To mouse for crimes against the laws, The idle, vicious, and the base, Those vermin of the human race Who still with petty crimes are piddling And on the moral cheesecake nibbling, All scamper from the Warden's sight And seek their safety in their flight. Doggerel Romaunt. [Come, Thalia, with thy comic smiles] [A chapter entitled, âFirst Theatrical Presentation in Bostonâ] Come, Thalia, with thy comic smiles, Thy quirps and cranks and wanton wiles, And with thee bring thy doleful sister And let the tearful Maid, now twist her Sad tragic Phiz and mouth so pretty Into all shapes to move our pitty, And let her bring her cup and dagger And start and weep and die or stagger Till she make hearts as hard as Pumpkins Grow soft as pates of City Bumpkins. She comes, I know her by her moaning Her deep drawn sighs and heavy groaning Her ah's and Oh's! her starts and throbs Her buskined toes, and tearful sobs; Yet fly, O fly, this Yanky land Where Puritans note high command. Hence, bear away thy tragic groan They love no sadness but their own, This Yankee town can surely be No place, Melpomene, for thee. I guess if you yourself don't hide well You'll act a moving part in bride well. The Doggered Romaunt. By the Author. [Shakespeare who's taste is never doubted] Shakespeare who's taste is never doubted In a fine passage often sprouted (I think it is in his Othello Where that besotted Negro fellow About a 'kerchief took such fright And put out Desdemona's light) Tells us that Jealousy I ween Has ghastly eyesâhe calls them green, But save with defference to sweet Willy I think his green eyes rather silly For Jealousy, I am inclined Has not green eyes, but is stone blind, Blind as a beetle when his flight Goes blundering onâa summer's night Into the fire or candle's light And burns his noseâto mend his sight. Doggerel Romaunt. By the Author. ['Tis autumn now, and all around] [A chapter entitled, âThanksgiving and Christmas Daysâ] 'Tis autumn now, and all around The teeming earth's with plenty crown'd Now, now prepare both great and small To hail New England's festival Thanksgiving Dayâoh day of joys Of capering Girls and hungry boys Thanksgiving comes, and with it brings The savoury flavour of good things PlumpuddingâTurkeysâroast and boil'd Brant, fowl, and geese both tame and wild Custards &amp; tarts and Whips froth'd high And last not least the Pumpkin pieâ Old Christmas in the rear is seen Deck'd with all sorts of evergreen Welcome to me Old Christmas merry Welcome thy mince pie, port and sherry But yet more welcome in my sight Is the rich cake of the twelfth night Ah lucky Damsel who is seen To draw the slice with hidden bean That sure prognostic she shall be A Bride before the year shall fleeâ Now Yankeys, let not self intrude But shew the fruits of gratitude Eat of the fat and drink the sweet And Hungry poor with portions treat. 'Tis eveningâand with merry shout In rush the merry antic routâ With mask, and grotesque dress and mien To act the ribald comic scene To dance, or fight, or laugh or cry As suits their mimic comedy; Pleased with the dole of some few pence, The Mansion's Master may dispense; Sure never was the Thespian trade So briefly done or so poorly paid. [I am a Doctor] [Within the body of this chapter a play is presented after the evening dinner. The following piece of dialogue is inserted in the text:] âI am a Doctor.â âYou a Doctor, what can you cure?â âThe itch, the Stitch, the Cholic &amp; gout The pains within, and pains without I can take an old woman of ninety nine Wrap'd up in pitch, tar &amp; turpentine And then with what lays on the point of this Knife Quickly I'll bring the old Lady to life And for the price of a half pistereen Can make her dance like a girl of sixteen.â [Oh what avails grave wisdom's voice] Oh what avails grave wisdom's voice Or circumspection's cautious tread To Man; his wisest, wariest choice Oft brings destruction on his head Shrouded with clouds, and darksome night The path of life, no gas-light shows And he who boasts the keenest sight Can't see an inch beyond his nose. The Pleasures of Pain. By the Author. [Says Jonathan to learned Joe] Says Jonathan to learned Joe What are those words you bring so pat in? For I can't guess you well may know. Quoth Joseph, âThey are Greek and Latin.â I talk in Latin and in Greek, Dear Jonathan, to show my knowledge That every time you hear me speak You'll cry, âHow grand to go to College.â Says Jock, âI count, beyond dispute, Why boys are kept at College dreaming, It is to talk so crabbed cute That nobody can know their meaning.â By the Author. The Splendour of the Finest Lyre ... Last words of Lord Byronâ âI must sleep nowââ Byron The splendour of the finest lyre, The eloquence of fameâ The spirit's intellectual fire, The glory and the nameâ The eagle wing that leaves behind The proud star in his flightâ The power, the energy, the mind, Unalterably bright; The heart that shuts its own bright lyre And sings its own sweet strain; Imagination's gorgeous views; (That rainbow of the brain) Are but transcripts of one truthâ Reflections of one ray, And speak to man, and hint to youth Of future dust,âdecay! Sleep! with thy glory round thy head Far from the grasp of wrong; Sleep! mightiest of the mighty dead! Thou idolized of song! Sleep! thou hast won a living tomb Within the heart's warm core; Nor grief, nor care, nor blight, nor gloom, Shall ever reach thee more! I fling my young song like a leaf On time's disastrous stream To find existence frail and brief, The record of a dream! But earth shall be a thing forgot, Existence but a nameâ When British hearts remember not Thy genius and thy fame! Sleep! in thy majesty aloneâ No earthly shroud is thine; Sleep! with a kingdom for thy throne With nature for thy shrine! Sleep till the Voice of Ages wake The glorious and the brave; Sleep till Eternity shall break The slumber of the grave! Brattleboro, Feb. 21, 1825â</field>
