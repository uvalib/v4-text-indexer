      <field name="fulltext">MY MUSE. Born of the sunlight, and the dew, That met amongst the flowers, That on the river margin grew, Beneath the willow bowers; Her earliest pillow was a wreath Of violets newly blown, And the meek incense of their breath At once became her own. Her cradle-hymn the river sung, In that same liquid tone With which it gave, when earth was young, Praise to the Living One. The breeze that lay upon its breast, Responded with a sigh;â And there the ring dove built her nest And sung her lulaby. The only nurse she ever knew Was Nature, free, and wild,â Such was her birth, and so she grew A moody, wayward child, Who lov'd to climb the rocky steep, To wade the mountain stream, To lie beside the sounding deep, And weave the magic dream. She lov'd the path with shadows dim, Beneath the dark leav'd trees, Where Nature's feather poets sing Their sweetest melodies; To dance amongst the pensile stems Where blossoms bright and sweet, Threw diamonds from their diadems Upon her fairy feet. She lov'd to watch the day star float Upon the Ã¦rial sea, Till morning sunk his pearly boat In floods of radiancy. To see the angel of the storm Upon his wind-wing'd car, With dark clouds wrap'd around his form, Come shouting from afar. And pouring treasures rich and free, The pure refreshing rain, Till every weed and forest tree Could boast its diamond chain. Then rising, with the hymn of praise, That swell'd from hill and dale, Display the rainbow, sign of peace, Upon its misty veil. She lov'd the waves' deep utteringsâ And gaz'd with frenzied eye, When night shook lightning from his wings, And winds went sobbing by. Full oft I chid the wayward child Her wandering to restrain; And sought her airy limbs to bind With prudence's wordly chain. I bade her stay within my cot, And ply the housewife's art;â She heard me, but she heeded not, Oh who can bind the heart? I told her she had none to guide Her inexperienced feet To where, through Tempe's valley, glide Castalia's waters sweet. No son of fame, to take her hand And lead her blushing forth, Proclaiming to the laurel'd band A youthful sister's worth; That there were none to help her climb The steep and toilsome way, To where, above the mists of time, Shines Genius' living ray. Where wreath'd with never fading flowers, The Harp immortal lies, Filling the souls that reach those bowers With heavenly melodies. I warn'd her of the cruel foes That throng that rugg'd path, Where many a thorn of misery grows, And tempests wreak their wrath. I told her of the serpents dread, With malice pointed fangs, Of yellow blossom'd weeds that shed Derision's maddening pangs. And of the broken, mouldering lyres Thrown carelessly aside, Telling the winds, with shivering wires, How noble spirits died. I saidâher sandals were not meet Such journey to essay, (There should be gold beneath the feet That tempt Fame's toilsome way,) But while I spoke, her burning eye Was flashing in the light That shone upon that mountain high, Insufferably bright. While streaming from the Eternal Lyre, Like distant echoes came A strain that wrap'd her soul in fire, And thrill'd her trembling frame. She sprang awayâthat wayward child, The harp! the harp! she cried; And still she climbs, and warbles wild, Along the mountain side. THE WANDERING SPIRIT. From where stupendous wrecks of ruin'd worlds, No longer guided by Omnipotence Through fields of light and glory, wander wild In dim cold chaos, where the elements Unyok'd and unrestrain'd, wage frantic war, Each as it gains the mastery triumphing With terrible rejoicing, showing forth The fierceness of his strength; where horrid forms Of all primeval monsters, and the shades Of wicked demi-gods, and spirits fallen, Like lurid meteors move amid the gloom, Each agonizing in the deep despair Of his own crush'd ambition, and lost hopes, A Spirit came, who mission'd from above Had err'd, and lost his way, by following A shade, through the bright wilderness of worlds Where system within system rolls along, Wheels within wheels, each with its myriad eyes Floating in glory round the throne of God; From whence that Spirit went while earth was young, Radiant with bliss and beauty, and sped on Forgetful of his charge, until he sunk In that abyss of wreck'd and worthless things Which God has thrown away. Amaz'd, he shrank From all the strange cold horrors of the scene, Where rough black masses, that were once fair worlds, Reel'd through the dark and voiceless sea of space; And fix'd white faces, and pale rigid forms, Gleam'd from the surging waves, of flood, and fire, Which winds, by God no longer held in check Heav'd onward in their fury. Horribly Glanc'd out the hideous phantoms, filling all The Spirit with a shuddering agony, A terror almost unendurable, As restlessly he rov'd and sought in vain The realms of light and order. When at length Subdued and wearied, like an eagle toss'd Amid the billows of a thunder cloud He droop'd his wings despairingly, there fell One glittering ray of mercy through the gloom, One warm life-colour'd rayâand he sprang up Rejoicing in its radiance into light, The thrilling light and warmth and hue of life. But not to his first bliss was he restor'd, But sent a wanderer through the universe, To follow shadows, and in weariness To long for rest,ârest, even beneath the feet Of the rejoicing angles. This green Earth Just then came sailing gloriously along Waving her fragrant garlands in the light And uttering as she mov'd a dreamy hymn Of all sweet melodies, so that it seem'd As if the atmosphere around her form Was one soft sea of fragrance giving out Delicious music from its moving waves. Wild with delight he threw him on her breast, And vow'd her fairer than his native heaven. It was indeed a rich and lovely spot That he alighted on. An orange grove, All thickly sprinkled with the pearly stars Of its luxuriant bloom. Sweet songs of birds Gush'd from the breezy shade, and ruby wings Flash'd mid'st the emerald foliage. Then a strain Of music, such as mingles with the soul Awaking all sweet memories, all pure thoughts, All high and deep emotions, floated past, And seem'd a vocal zephyr worshipping The purity of love. Heaven is not far! The Wandering Spirit cried in ecstacy, For, lo! a Spirit from its melodies Is lingering near me. Listâanother strain Richer and sweeterâand the Spirit rose And sought the fountain of those harmonies, Which he imagin'd came all fresh from Heaven. He had forgotten how divinely pure Heaven's tuneful spirits are. And now he stood Before a gilded temple, which threw off The dazzling sunbeams like a thousand shafts Of glittering glory. Bosom'd deep it stood In clustering rose-trees, and the fairest vines Train'd o'er the portico their scented wreaths, And bound the snowy columns; while within A fountain of pure water threw its gems Upon the blue-vein'd marble of the floor; And o'er the delicate spice-breathing plants That droop'd their pearly flowers, which seem'd so frail That they might melt, and breathe themselves away Upon the trembling air that bath'd the brow And stir'd the dark locks of a maid, who lay On crimson cushions, 'neath the azure folds Of heavy silken curtains, sweeping low With fringe of glittering gold, and rows of pearl. That maid was slight, symmetrical and fair, Not white like sculptur'd stone, but richly ting'd With beauty, life, and health. The rose-hued gauze That floated o'er the swelling loveliness Of shoulders, neck, and bosom, only seem'd To lend a modest blush to things too pure And wholly beautiful to need a veil. Her features all were perfect, and her face A faultless temple of transparent pearl Through which gleam'd out with warm and ardent light The torch of every minister that came To offer up his worship. In her eyes So soft, so dark, so melting, liv'd a smile Of maiden love, in its pure worshipping Its perfect trust and truth. The spirit felt That he had never touched a thing so fair So worthy of his worship. From her lips Breath'd melting music, filling all the air With living melody. Another soundâ A form approach'd the bower, a tall strong man Of fierce expression, forehead high and clear O'er which the ebon clusters of his hair Lay in fine contrast, but his knitted brow Bent like black clouds, above his lightning eyes, That glanc'd with piercing splendour, and the lips Were finely cut, expressing depth, and strength Of purpose, and emotion. Such a one He was, as woman of the melting heart May love to adoration. For it seems That love forever throws his richest light And sweetest rose buds, over the stern heart And haughty brow, where passions strong and fierce Sit thron'd in dark dominion. Woman's soul Seems ever to derive its highest bliss From the proud ardent worshipping of one Who never bow'd or sued to aught on earth Except her worth and beauty. For she deems That water pure and inexhaustible, Which gushes from the flint rock; while the spring Upon the green hill side, that bubbles up Amongst sweet blossoms, in the time of dearth Will fail, and leave the flowers it nurs'd, to die. The Spirit shrank before that mortal form And deem'd that some dark fiend had dared intrude Thus on the presence of a deity. Surely, he said, the gentle one will fly From such a fearful presence. But she rose At his approach; and with a cry of joy Gave her white hand in greeting. Then it was That Spirit witness'd first, and doubtingly, The fond idolatry of human love, The all-revealing worship of the eyes, The smile that melts and mingles hearts in bliss, The timid touch that thrills along the nerves, And spreads a flush of beauty o'er the cheek As if the altar fire upon the heart Flash'd up, and fill'd the temple, beaming through The half transparent walls, with crimson light. Carlosâthe maiden murmur'd o'er and o'er, LuellaâDearestâwas the fond reply. And there was rapture in the low sweet tones That came in fitful murmurs from red lips, That trembled with emotion. Here is bliss The Spirit said. The heaven I left has naught More deep, and all-pervading. It was night, One of those sweet still nights that seem to shed A peace upon the soul, subduing all Its pains and passions into calm repose. When moonlight calls young timid lovers forth To weave fond fancies with its trembling beams, And breathe soft messages to silvery clouds That flit like angels 'tween the earth and heaven, And hear responses in the balmy breath Of winds, which with their pinions cool with dew Linger amongst the rose buds, touch their lips And catch the holy incense of their breath. Long Carlos sat, conversing sigh for sigh With this sweet soother, which would lovingly Lift, like a playful sister, his damp curls And bathe his throbbing temples and flush'd cheek, With unction of rich balm, then sink away With low and tender whisper, but to come Again with richer offering. Carlos' soul Grew faint and sorrowful in that soft night, A heavy sadness press'd upon his mind, As when the shadow of a hideous dream Lies heavy on the morning. He arose And wander'd musing through the orange grove Which wav'd in dewy beauty like a flood Of scented water, rich with pearly fleets Of living blossoms, round Luella's bower. His thoughts were with the maiden, and he dwelt On all her fervent truth, and trusting love All through the weary years, in which they knew No comforter but hopeâwhile sternly proud His sire watch'd o'er the heir of his high name And scorn'd the tree upon the last green bough Of which, in lonely bloom, Luella hung. And when he fled away, she knew not where, Departing in his madness suddenly, Without a farewell even unto her To brave the sword, the ball, fatigue, and thirst, Famine and death, amid the frantic scenes Where madmen seek for gloryâwhere the brave Seek blessings, peace, and freedom; where he sought Oblivion to the pangs that would not sleep; The pangs of wounded pride, of hope deferr'd, Of baffl'd passion, and of self reproach. And when upon his casque the lurid light That men call glory dwelt, he turned away Disgusted, from the foul phosphoric light That feeds on death, and torture, blood, and tears, And sighs from withering hearts. So he came home Way worn, and wounded, and in pilgrim guise Hoping he knew not what. It was a night Of fearful tempest, when he stood once more Before his father's portal, and requir'd The pilgrim stranger's boon, and then so chang'd Was he, that servants who had dandled him Upon their knees, no longer knew his face, But told the stranger of young Carlos' flight Or most mysterious death; and that their lord Smil'd never from that day, but moan'd and sigh'd And wander'd like one crazy, calling oft On Carlos' name, in such a plaintive tone Of broken-hearted sorrow, that the rocks Which caught the echoes threw them back again With voice of bitter weeping. For they said The heart of their good lord was rich in love, But that the rose of his affections died While yet the dew of life's refulgent morn Lay trembling in its bosom. From that hour His spirit knew no joy, but in the child Which with her dying blessing she bequeath'd To his paternal love. The old men wept As they rehears'd their grief, and Carlos' heart Was full almost to bursting, as they told How their good lord had died, with Carlos' name, In mingled prayers and blessings, on his lips. But not a word was said by these old men, Of Carlos' lov'd Luella, and her name His lips refus'd to utter, yet he stray'd Still wrap'd in his disguise, to that dear grove And met her weeping thereâWith timid glance She scan'd his person, then with trembling joy Sank on his bosom. Days of full blown bliss Had since been his; and now it but remain'd To lead her to the altar. Musing thus Upon Luella's sorrows, love, and truth, And all his painful wanderings, and the peace, The ecstatic peace now closing its soft wings Around his quiet heart, he wanders on To his Luella's bower. It is her voice What does she here at midnight? who is he Who sits familiarly beside her? Heavens! She weepsâand with an earnest voice protests Her fond and changeless love. Oh agony Can this be possible? And yet he hears That voice, the very music of his soul Vowing the love away, which until then He never once had doubted, which has been His solace in all illsâa holy shield From sin, and all temptation; the one pearl Which he had deem'd the world and his own soul A price too low for. Now all, all was pastâ The mirror broken that reflected heaven, And his heart rent asunder. With a groan He knelt down at her feet, drew his keen blade And pierc'd his breast, so that the warm blood sprang And sprinkled her white bosom. One wild cry She utter'd clasp'd her arms around his neck And they sank down together All aghast The wandering spirit stood. He had assum'd The form of Carlos, and with words of doubt. Drawn from Luella those assurances Which Carlos' ear had drank, he could have fled Even to the chaotic gulf again To 'scape the terrors of that scene of death. Benelli! cried a Watcher from on high, Thou vain and erring spirit! see what wo One quilty thought of thine has brought to pass! Now thou art doom'd to linger in this bower And sooth that wretched maiden visible To her alone, in that beloved form In which thou didst deceive her. Come, and look Upon the face of death, the child of sin, And shudder lest it be thy fearful doom To dwell with it forever. The display That pains the mourner's eye, the funeral pomp, That strange absurdity of human pride Which decks pale death in glittering panoply And mocks corruption with a show of power Had been enacted; and Luella sat Cold, pale, and feeble, with neglected hair And deep black garments, on the blood stain'd pave Within her fatal bower. A shadow pass'dâ Wild expectation waken'd, wilder hope Stir'd her soul's centre. More distinct it grew Upon the moonlight. Carlos! Love! she cried In tones of fearful rapture, Heaven be prais'd My prayer is answer'd; angel witnesses Have told thee all my truth, and thou art come To say thou dost not doubt me. 'Twas a fiend That taught thee to be jealous of a heart Which was all full of thee. Speak to me love, But once, and say thou know'st me purely true. There came a voice of music on the night, As if the air were living melody, And every drop of dew a crystal bell Rung by a vocal billow. As dew in the heart Of the virgin rose, When first at morn Its leaves unclose, As the flake of snow When it first finds rest On the feathering moss Of the mountain's breast, As the gem that lies In the deep, deep sea, So purely true Is thy Love for me. Oh mourn not my love For united in heart, And one in spirit We cannot part. My dwelling is now In this sorrowful bower, Oh come to me ever At this still hour, Till thou from the earth And sorrowing free, Shalt bathe in the fountain Of love with me. In lingering cadence on the balmy breeze The music died, and with its melting tone The spirit shadow faded. On her knees Luella had been listening, and her face, Late like a lily on a broken stem, Grew radiant as the morning, while she pour'd A rapturous thanksgiving. Round her stood Her maids in wonder. They had only seen The shadow of a cloud that cross'd the moon; And whisper'd music of the dark green leaves Conversing with the wind was all they heard; And so they wept in pity and declar'd Their broken-hearted lady lunatic. In vain she told them Carlos had been there With words of consolation. How could they Believe so strange a story? so they pray'd With many tears, and watch'd her night and day, And every night sat with her in her bower, And heard her sad communings with her love Till their hearts melted, and their sobs grew loud, And drown'd her gentle murmurs. Sad it was To see her feeding thus upon her grief And life from her young lips, and tainted cheek Slow fading like the radiance of the west Before night's pensive face. Her father's heart, As her life wasted, wither'd. He had laid A wife, and seven fair children in their graves, And she alone was left, and he had hoped Such fond and brilliant things as fathers hope For fair and gentle daughters. Now he wept Her swift decay, with agonizing pray'rs That he might die with her, and thus escape The desolation which an old man feels Alone beside his hearth; whence all fair forms, All gentle voices, and all loving hearts Have gone forevermore. Benelli, then, Who furnish'd for celestial happiness, Had envied the one bliss of human hearts, Felt how like gall and wormwood to the taste The cup that we have long'd to drain may prove. Luella's soul was now pour'd out to him In words of fervent love, while stern despair Held all her pulses in a torturing check, And thus her eye was dim, and pale her cheek, Her brain oppress'd as by a weight of ice, While in her breast the burning current lay Like Ãtna's bosom'd lava, drying up The silver spring of being; and her words Were sad, and incoherent, yet most sweet, Like pensive wailings of a soft-ton'd harp Broken, and hung upon a willow tree Where the long weepers streaming on the wind Sweep o'er the chords, and waken low strange tones Which melt into the spirit, as the dew Comes down into the blossom, filling it With an oppressive sweetness till it droops, And weeps delicious tears. The moon had set, The stars were dim, like sleepy watchers' eyes; The winds, the waters, every thing was still, So still that one might almost be forgiven For deeming that the God of nature slept Upon her placid breast. The last pale rose Lay scatter'd, like a shiver'd diadem, Within Luella's bower, and she was there, Reclin'd upon her couch, wasted and weak And white as alabaster. Round her knelt Her weeping maidens, while with broken sighs She murmur'd to her loveâI feel, she said At length, a drowsy faintness. All my frame Grows chill and heavyâCarlosâthis is deathâ My bridal hour has comeâWait for me loveâ I will go with thee soon. Now shall I learn, Benelli said, this mystery of life In unity with clay. The last faint sigh Was lingering on Luella's trembling lips, The light was fading from her half clos'd eyes, The faithful girls who bath'd her hands with tears, Now shudder'd as they felt how cold they grew. Then o'er her form Benelli first observ'd An exhalation like a silvery mist, Wreathing and gathering, as when the sun Exhales light vapours from a mountain spring. Condensing slowly, it at length rose up In form and feature of the nerveless clay From which it was releas'd; but that it stood In pure etherial transparency, And mournful in its beauty, as it seemed To seek some kindred shade, or spirit guide To lead it to its home. My beautiful! Benelli cried, thou now art like to me And thou art now mine own. With one wild cry She fled at his approach, and meteor-like Left but a shining track along the sky, And vanish'd from his view. Aloneâaloneâ Benelli stood, and felt the dreariness Of utter desolation, hopelessâcoldâ Almost without a wish. But he was free To wander as he listed. So he pass'd From zone to zone, through every varied clime In search of rest, but naught on earth could still The yearning of his nature. Human love He had explor'dâits strength, its depth, its bliss, Its anguish, and its end. Beauty's spell Could thrall him never more, for he had seen Its loveliest blossom die. In restless mood, He mingled with the fitful autumn winds, And joy'd to shake the sear leaves from the trees, In some old pathless wood. To strip the bloom From off the latest flower stalk in the glen, To fright the timid fawn from his repast By sudden rustling of the thicket near. To chase the sweet lone warbler from the spray With sound of rushing wings. To drive, with storms, The flights of birds of passage, till their wings Were wet, and weary in the aerial way. To wreck the frail and beautiful of earth And strew them in the dust. When winter came He rode the tempest, shouted in the blast, Piled up the drift, and dash'd the cutting sleet In each wayfarer's face. Moan'd at the door Of weary hearted watcher, till her blood Grew curdly in its channels. Shook the sash And shriek'd at midnight, till the love lorn maid Believ'd her lost one's spirit sought to find Admittance to her chamber, to unfold The fearful mysteries of the unseen world. But when the azure eye of the young spring Beam'd on him with its tearful smile of love, The gentle influence that was all abroad Fell on him like the blessed summer rain Upon the desert, melting even him To pensive tenderness, so that he lov'd To echo back the carol of the bird By dell or wilderness. To swell the song Of running waters. 'Twas an eventide When spring's first buds were opening, that he met Beside a mountain stream a pensive man, Of whom he well might deem that all life's fire Was centred in his eyes, so radiantly They dwelt on earth and heaven; while lip, and cheek Were white as Paros marble. Here is one, He cried, with whom a spiritual creature may Hold close communion. He has naught of earth Except this half transparent veil of flesh Which clogs the flight of the impetuous soul, And dims the mental sight. So, day by day, He wander'd with a man who idly sought To wreath undying garlands of the flowers That grow in death's domain. Who vainly sought To find the living waters gushing free Amid the sand hills of this desert world. And it was joy unto him to converse With such a wayward man; to fill his mind With strange fantastic visions, and wild shapes Of bright unreal fancies, such as men Are prone to worship. Many a summer eve At that entrancing hour which casts a spell Of melting sweetness over soul and sense. Of nature's children; when the green earth lies So like a garland on the rosiest wave Of heaven's pure sea of glory; where the soul Seems blending with the holy atmosphere Of beauty, fragrance, and rich melody, That flows in blissful billows from high heaven Through all infinity, that poet rov'd With pallid cheek, wrap'd sense, and heavenward eye, His bosom swelling with the single tide Of feelingâdeep strange feeling, drawing in At each avenue of the raptur'd soul Streams of Jehovah's glory, till his brain Grew wild with ecstacy, and thrilling words Hung trembling on his lips. Benelli then Delighted to be near him, to sketch forth Forms of immortal beauty, as they dwelt Upon his memory, by the touch of earth, And breath of error render'd dim and dark; Or whisper to him half forgotten tales Of heaven's incommunicable bliss; Its all pervading and ecstatic love; Its full fruition: with the consciousness Of never ending durance. Oft he threw The beauty of his form upon the mist That floated down the valley; or look'd forth With soul bewildering smile from fleecy clouds That lay amid the ocean of the west, When such a changing radiance of bright beams Of every hue of glory centre there, That we believe that heaven, with all its pomp, Is hidden only by the emerald wall Of our horizonâo'er the billowy heights Of which gleam angels' wings, and crimson robes, And harps, and coronets, of burnish'd goldâ Till as we gaze we almost seem to hear The distant echo of seraphic song Blent with the low sweet music of the wind. And when the holy night had put aside The glittering tissue of the veil of day, Revealing the infinite depths, in which Our universe performs its measur'd dance, With myriads of bright creatures, keeping time To choral singing of the morning stars Around the throne of God,â'twas his delight To point out angels, with their flashing wings, Deep in the dark expanse, guiding the stars, Or riding the fierce comets joyously Up their eliptic arches, and away Unto the verge of the chaotic gulf, At thought of which he shuddered, while he drew Dark visions of stupendous horror thence, And wove them with the strange imaginings Of that poor visionary poet's brain, Who pour'd them forth in bursts of raptur'd song On which the world hung spell bound with delight; And Fame, and Honour twin'd their richest wreaths, Decreed them his, and hung them up on high To be admir'd, and envied, and adored, Throughout all time; while he, to whom belong'd The living laurel, dwelt in solitude, Neglected, poor, and quite unknown by all. And if a distant echo of his fame Was borne to his low home, how vain and cold It fell upon his spirit, like the dew That autumn sheds upon the dying flowers. What value had the world's applause to him Who lack'd the âdaily breadâ for which each morn He made his humble prayer?âThe world knew wellâ Taught by the inspiration of his song That he was pouring his rich spirit out From deep and fatal wounds within his heart. Yet she rejoiced, and will'd him to sing on, That she might drink his fragrance till she reel'd. For he was to her like the precious tree Which drops delicious incense from the wound Of which 'tis sure to die. So he sung on, And she ador'd his lay and let him starve. Then rear'd a proud mausoleum to his name, And wrote, in golden letters, on its front, The last and saddest lay that agony Wrung out from his crush'd heart, as with a smile His rich and lofty spirit pass'd away. Benelli hover'd by the low green mound That humble weepers piled above his form, And where the tresses of the willow tree Dishevel'd, like a stricken woman's hair, Were floating on the breeze, which ever more Linger'd in that sweet spot, near which a brook Sung its eternal song, with chorus sweet Hymn'd by the congregation of glad birds That cluster'd in the shade. And every day His beautiful black spaniel, poor Fidelle, Came to her master's grave, and laid her down Above his breast, on which lay stiff and still The hand that fed her, and with fond caress Lay on her head, or smooth'd her velvet coat, While big tears dropp'd upon her, as he said In all this cold wide world, my poor Fidelle, I have no friend but thee. Then she would moan, And her large eyes grow wet with sympathy. Then he would pity her, and smile and say, I will not make thee sorrowful Fidelle, Come let us go and play. Then she would leap, And show her gladness in a thousand ways As nature gave her utterance; and the man Would half forget his sorrows in the joy Of his dumb play-fellow, whose faithful love Was sweeter and more precious to his heart, Than all the promises of deathless fame That came in babbling echoes to his ears. And now that all her agonizing cries Fail'd to arouse him, still she linger'd there, With nature's unambiguous eloquence, Beseeching every one who came that way To give her back her master,âtill at length There came a lady of a pensive mien, In dress as black and shining as Fidelle's, And eyes almost as dark, although their light, Half quench'd by sorrow, trembled on the view Like purest diamond shining meekly up Through salt sea-ripples. On her brow there lay A meekness as of sorrow link'd with love, To her it was a luxury to weep O'er every thing that bore similitude To her own broken visions. So she came And knelt beside that grave, and pray'd, and wept, With one arm round Fidelle, who nestled close Unto her bosom, moaning piteously. And when at length the lady rose to go And said wilt thou go with me poor Fidelle, The creature went, for very gratitude That she wept o'er her master. So it is, Benelli said. The love which might have fed His lamp of life with rapture, many a day, Now when his ear is deaf, and clos'd his eye, Pours out its soul in weeping o'er his tomb. Alas for Genius! This is then the meed That earth accords unto it,âbroken hopes, A life of penury, a deathâof want, And fearful struggles of a mighty mind, Which wrestling with the angels for the gems That glow upon their lyres, forgets that life Is nurtur'd on the bosom of the earth; Yet being link'd to nature feels her pangs And blends her wailing with its highest notes. While list'ning thousands bless the agony That wrings his tuneful life out, drop by drop, And clap their hands in raptures of delight Because he moans so sweetly. Proving thus The richest halo of poetic fame A rainbow of the brightest hues of heaven In glory living, on a shower of tears. Thus mus'd Benelli o'er the sepulchre, Dark'ning the willow shadows with the hue Of his desponding thoughts. The trumpet's voice Arous'd him from his grief, and he went forth Where men were telling, with enthusiasm, Of laurels to be won on battle-fields, So glorious that the myriads of the earth Go forth and jeopard life, for the delight Of seeing such celestial chaplets bloom One single moment, o'er a victor's brow. I know, he said, there is a treasure hid Amid the fading blossoms of this world, Which satisfies the longings of the soul, And fill its vast desires with floods of peace. I'll go and seek it, where mankind contend For Victory's starry crown. From sea to sea He wander'd, scanning eagerly the earth, But mountain, plain, and vale were beautiful With sweet white flowers of peace. No stains of blood Mix'd its pollution with the laughing rill, No foot print of the war-horse mark'd the sod That lay so soft all bright, by field, and grove. But scatter'd up and down, where'er he went, Were august statues, and proud monuments, Commemorative of the hero's fame. At length he found him on an isle that lay Upon the ocean, like an autumn leaf Thrown on a world of waters, all alone. There by an isolated monument, He heard men say, that He who slept beneath Won, wore, and lost, the richest diadem That minion ever worship'd. Then they told How like a startling meteor was his course, With lurid lustre rising from the sea, And passing on with fierce magnificence, Washing his way with blood; while the earth shook And men knelt down and worship'd, pouring forth Loud prayers and pÅans to the conqueror's name. But woman's voice of agony was there, Wild wailing o'er her immolated loves, And desecrated home. At length he sunk Beneath a âsea of flame.â And men look'd on And wonder'd, when they saw the fallen star Shorn of its haloâtoss'd about by powers That late stood trembling, smitten with its fear; Until at length, on that lone ocean isle Its light went outâforever. Sick at heart Benelli sought the immortality For which the buried of Saint Helena Liv'd, spake, and acted. 'Twas a mournful scroll Of mighty deeds, all blotted o'er with blood, And blister'd in its proudest passages With woman's heart-wrung tears; while every leaf Of deathless laurel that enwreath'd his name, Was dripping with the hot and bitter drops By misery wrung from hearts whence he had torn The loving and belov'd. It is enough. Oh I am sick of earth, Benelli said, This beautiful bright earth, with bow'rs, and streams, And flowers, and fruits, amid which it would seem That Angels might be happy, yet where dwells No perfect lasting bliss. Where death! death! death! Is written every where. Have I not seen The loveliest of its creatures fade, and die? Have I not commun'd with a mighty mind, A high pure spirit that stoop'd not to earth, But hover'd ever on the verge of heaven, Catching the echoes of celestial lyres, And sending them like sweet familiar birds, To fill with music every verdant spot By cottage, hall, or palace? Yet he diedâ Even in the day of manhood's prime, he died! And here in this lone ocean isle is built A tomb, to which ambition need but come To prove his torch a death-light, and his crown A wreath of funeral cypress, dew'd with tears. Earth! earth! If it were mine to guide thy course I'd hurl thee to thy fellows, in th' abyss Of horrible confusion. There, vain hope Comes never, to transform the evening clouds Into a glorious miniature of heaven, And bear the spirit on her downy wing Up, up, toward it, till the bright hues fade, And livid lightnings leap from the dark pile And strike him back to earth to agonize With disappointment, far more terrible Than all the sullen torpor of despair. So, recklessly he wander'd, scorning all The cares, the hopes, the pleasures of mankind, Till coming to a soft and quiet vale, That lay so like the cradle of repose, Amid the wooded mountains of the west, He linger'd in its bosom. Cool and bright, Beneath green willows lay the valley brook Soft murmuring in its sleep; while blossom'd weeds Dip'd their fair fingers in the limpid tide, And threw the pure drops on the lingering breeze That stole away the fragrance of their breath, And mingled it with incense from the bloom Of vines, that wreath the columns of a porch Before a white-wash'd cottage, which repos'd Beneath the shining foliage of dark oaks, Which almost hid it from the eye of day. There, bosom'd from the world, a lady dwelt With one fair daughter, and the happy man Who held that daughter's heart in nuptial bond. Of gentle seeming was that lady's form, And there was radiance in her eyes that shed A sunlight o'er her pale and pensive face; And there was music in her voice, which spoke A woman's tender heart. Her hands were full Of consolations, which she scatter'd free To all the sick, the poor, the sorrowful. Her days were pass'd in usefulness, and peace; And evening always found her in her bower, A sweet fair spot, beneath an aged oak All wreath'd with mistletoe. Here, on her knees, With lowly spirit, she pour'd forth her soul In fervent aspiration. Angel forms Were ever near her, with their balmy breath To bless her, with the atmosphere of heaven; And oft she gave thanksgiving unto God For all the joy, the grief, the weal, the woe, With which his loving hand had strewn her path. Here, said Benelli, is true piety, A gem which I had deem'd earth could not boast. Till now I have but seen its counterfeit, Consisting in a name, or formal dress. But here within the oft afflicted heart Of this meek lovely woman, it wells up So sweet and pure, that angel ministers May lave their shining pinions in the spring And bear its dews to heaven. I will remain, And learn of her, till I can offer up That prayer, which rises to the eternal throne, Than incense sweeter, richer than the hymns Of raptur'd angels; even the humble voice Wrung from the heart which feels, âThy will be done.â 'Twas morn. The breeze was out upon the hills Shaking the sleepy blossoms, and ripe buds Till they awake, and offer'd unto heaven Their treasur'd incense. Many bright wing'd birds Like jewel'd bells amongst the airy boughs Rung out, their joyous matins, and the light That melted sweetly down into the vale Seem'd mix'd of balm and music. Mournfully That morning enter'd through the dewy vines, The windows of the cottage in the vale, And dwelt upon the most heart rending scene Of sorrow's drama. On a snow-white couch Wrap'd in the pure habilaments of death Was laid an infant. Like a form of wax It was, so fair, even to transparency, And beautifully moulded. But the lips Were livid, and the eyes clos'd heavily, In the eternal sleep. On that same couch The mother languish'd like a broken flower Which breathes the treasures of its perfumes out At once, in dying sighs. Her soft brown hair Lay o'er her pillow in dishevel'd curls, And gave her high smooth forehead to the view More pearly in its whiteness; while her cheeks Wore each a flush, so like a wither'd rose. The white vein'd lids lay heavy on her eyes, So blue and deep, like fountains garner'd up In marble basins, 'neath cerulean skies, And on the soft dark lashes hung the last Overflowing of their waters, for the ice Of death was gathering o'er them. Painfully Her bosom heav'd, and from her fading lips Came low and fitful murmurings of prayer And praise to her Redeemer. By her side Stood her young loving husband, with his crush'd And agonizing heart. Oh God! he groan'd, I cannotâO I cannot let her go! My own sweet wife! My loving, and belov'd, We cannot part so soon. This bitter dayâ How I have long'd for it, with trembling hope, That I might see my child upon thy breast And hear the dear name, father! It has come And I am childless, widow'd, desolate.â Oh speak not thus, dear love, the wife replied, The Lord has done this. He does all things well. I may not stay with thee, but thou may'st come To be with me forever, in that world Where death comes not, and none shall say farewell. The widow'd mother of the dying one Through all that painful scene, stood meekly by, To bathe with cordial drops the quivering lips, And with a perfum'd 'kerchief wipe away The death dew from her forehead. Big bright tears. Dropp'd slowly from her eyes, and from her lips Came broken aspirations unto heaven. Her last fond earthly hope lay broken there, The tree which she had nurtur'd from the germ, Which grew so fair and free, which she had deem'd Would be a grateful shelter to her age, Was cut down in its beauty. Yet she said Thy will, Oh God, be done. Thy blessed will Which takes my daughter from this world of pain To everlasting rest. They made a grave, Beneath the oak tree, in the bower of pray'r; And there, with solemn anthem unto Him Who is the Resurrection and the Life. They laid the wither'd blossom, and the bud, And there at eve the childless widow knelt, And still thanksgiving mingled with her prayer, Thanksgiving that the treasure buried there Had been to her a blessing, many years, And that the gentle creature was not forced To drink life's chalice to the bitter dregs, But that the first keen draught of agony Had proved the last. That she was now in Heaven, Where through the mercy of the blessed One She would be with her soon. Months pass'd away, And he who wept so agonizingly Beside his dying wife, was comforted. Ayeâhe had whisper'd to a second bride, I never loved till now. The mother's heart Was not of such material. No fair girl Could lay a balm leaf on her memory, And write her own name there. And yet she said My blessed child needs not his yearning loveâ And so she smil'd upon his happiness And bless'd her second daughter, winning thus The love, and gratitude of her young heart. It was October, by the grass grown grave The widow sat alone. The low voic'd brook Seem'd purer underneath the deep blue arch Of the autumnal heaven. A few sweet birds Had made this shelter'd vale a resting place, And from the shelter of the dark green oaks Fill'd their sweet songs of passage. Fitful winds Were sporting on the hillsides, shaking nuts And acorns from the overladen trees; And chasing to the valley bright ripe leaves, As playful children chase the butterfly. The nimble squirrel, and the timid mouse Were gathering in their harvest; while the sun Smil'd like a good man on the general joy. The mourner view'd the scene with placid eye And blessed the bounteous Ruler of the year, For all his goodness. A few years at most She said, and I shall drop from off life's tree Like one of these ripe leaves. But I have hope Thanks to the Merciful, a joyous hope, Worth more to me than a whole universe Though it were built of diamonds. None but Thou Oh holy fount of goodness, none but Thou Can'st satisfy the spirit. Though it rove From star to star, and make the worlds its own, It cannot rest, till it resigns itself With all its treasures wholly unto thee. No fear can reach it then, no cruel power Wrest it from thy protection; no wild fear Destroy its peace. It knows in whom it trusts And therefore fears no evil. Blessed Lord! Let me be thine, and all thy will be done. Thy will be done! Oh God omnipotent, Benelli said, Thy righteous will be done. Here is the secret of all happiness. This lone, weak woman carries in her breast The germ my spirit-wisdom sought in vain, Through all the ocean of space infinite, Amid its radiant bands of sounding orbs, And mighty angels passing to and fro, Charg'd with the mandates of Omnipotence, And doing all his pleasure joyfully. But I was proud. I trusted mine own strength, Preferring mine own will, and stubbornly Wrestling against Jehovah. Oh how vain! His word controls all powers. Spirits and men, Will seek in vain for happiness or peace Until they yield them, and find rest in him. What waves of glory fill'd the valley then With swelling, soul entrancing melody, As if all heaven were passing, and its train Of majesty and bliss had fallen there. Then hovering round Benelli, beautiful With that high joy, which perfect creatures feel O'er humble penitence, shone radiant forms Of ministering spirits. Bending low He stood, in deep humility, and felt Pure love, and rapture, all his being thrill. Celestial splendour gathered round his form, And rising in their light; amid the groups Of glittering creatures, he returned to God. TO A FLIGHT OF WILD GEESE. Dark wing'd couriers of the sky, Riding on the stormy air, Shouting forth your clarion cry, Winter comes, prepare! prepare! Tell me, ye who ride the waves, Ye who breast the thunder storm; Issuing from the northern caves, Saw ye winter's icy form? Times' and seasons' mystic lore, How did ye, wild birds, attain? Which Astrologers of yore Perill'd souls to find, in vain. Read ye on the page of heaven That which wandering planets write? Are, by flaming meteors given Signals of your time of flight? Or do spirit-voices come From the night winds' drifting car, Whispering through your summer home Of a lovelier land, afar? Do ye on your mighty sails Float majestically forth, When the current of the gales Rolls its billows from the North? Tell me, Oh ye free, and strong, Shouting thus upon the air, Where ye love, and rear your young, Where your summer dwellings are? Lie they where some lucid lake Looks to heaven with dimpling smiles, While its whispering wavelets break Round the feet of fairy isles? Rich with spirit-haunted bowers Where the languid south wind comes, Dreaming through the noon-day hours, Cradled by the balmy blooms. Where as soft as angels' dreams Lie the lingering twilight hours, And the moon's pellucid beams Steal like spirits through the bowers. Where the richest grasses spread Every where beneath your feet; And the wild rice bends its head, Offering a delicious treat. Round these islands of delight, Fearless of the threat'ning gale, Thron'd upon the ripples bright, Did ye like fair galleys sail? Trac'd ye many a lovely shore By the foot of man untrod, Where the robe that Nature wore, Was the handiwork of God? Whither wing ye now your way? Will ye pass the wintry hours Where the placid southern sea Sighs along enchanted shores? Beautiful, and wing'd with might! Free as Freedom's mountain wind; Heedless ye pursue your flight, Leaving trace, nor voice behind. THE BRIDE OF HEAVEN. How beautiful she lies, upon her pure white bed, While pale flowers o'er her brow, a holy incense shed; The eyelids tremble not, so peaceful is her rest, That even her maiden heart lies silent in her breast. Why o'er the sweet calm face, fond mother, dost thou weep, Would'st thou awake thy child, from such a quiet sleep? She is asleep with Him, whose love alone is pure, Within whose presence bliss shall evermore endure. No grief, no care, no pain, can ever pierce her heart, No lov'd voice say again, âsweet sister, we must part!â The living waters sweet, have quenched her spirit's thirst, And on her soul the light of Holiness has burst. Why weep we then for her, whose days of pain are o'er? Bright hands have wiped her tears, and she shall shed no more. To agony and tears, the brides of earth are givenâ Oh, bless her, as she lies, the pure young bride of Heaven. TO THE WOOD ROBIN. Bird of the twilight hour! My soul goes forth to mingle with thy hymn, Which floats like slumber round each closing flower, And weaves sweet visions through the forest dim. Where days' sweet warblers rest, Each gently rocking on the waving spray, Or hovering the dear fledgelings in the nest Without one care-pang for the coming day. Oh, holy bird, and sweet Angel of this dark forest, whose rich notes Gush like a fountain in the still retreat, O'er which a world of mirror'd beauty floats. My spirit drinks the stream, Till human cares and passions fade away; And all my soul is wrapp'd in one sweet dream, Of blended love, and peace, and melody. Sweet bird! that wak'st alone The moonlight echoes of the flowery dells, When every other wing'd lute is flown, And insects sleeping all in nodding bells. I bow my aching head, And wait the unction of thy voice of love; I feel it o'er my weary spirit shed, Like dew from balmy flowers that bloom above. O! when the loves of earth Are silent birds, at close of life's long day; May some pure seraphim of heavenly birth, Bear on its holy hymn, my soul away. AUTUMN. Autumn is in the forest, hymning forth A wild farewell to summer. All sweet birds Hear her low voice, and lift their shining wings, With answering chorus of soft melody, Pure as a seraph songâand float away Upon the swelling anthem, toward the South, O'er whose warm beauties, the inconstant sun, Which turns so carelessly from our cold clime, Hangs evermore rejoicing. Summer friends Are those soft vested warblers; when the grove Is full of joy and beauty, they are there, Gladdest and brightest of all lovely things. But when the sun withdraws his fervid smile, When beauty languishes, and joy no more Stirs nature's sentient pulse, they too depart; Leaving the shadowy galleries of the wood To the lone pinions of the sobbing wind, Which mourns the bright departed, yet leads on The cheerful Autumn, with her generous hand And deep blue loving eye. So kindly now She bids the little flowers lie down and sleep, And spreads above them gorgeous covering Of full ripe foliage, which the forest trees Cast from them, at her bidding. Now she shakes The brown nuts from the boughs, and calls aloud To merry squirrel, and the timid mouse, âFill your store-houses now, for winter comes! I hear the echo of his chariot wheels, Amongst the icebergs of the frozen sea, That walls his sanctuary in the North From man's adventurous footstep.â At her words The little sportive creatures skip around, And gather up her bounty. While the deer Feed on the acrid acorns, or pick up Sweet chestnuts on the hill. Autumn is kind And bountiful to all. While unto man She brings the treasures of corn, fruits, and wine; She spreads the forest-dwellers' plenteous feast, Of nuts, and seeds, and berries, and wild grapes, By mountain, plain, and river. Beautiful Is Autumn, in her bright maturity, Array'd in regal purple, and rich gold, And bearing gifts from Him, whose open hand Fills every living thing with plenteousness. Queen of the year, is Autumn. Majesty Sits like a diadem upon her brow; The smile of heaven is in her clear blue eye, As with a passionless, and gracious mien She walks the quiet earth, and every where By forest, field and garden, hill and dell, Writes words of wisdom, which the young and old, The high and low, may read, and understand, And practise, and grow better. TO THE WHIPPOORWILL. Bird of the evening, hast thou come With thy familiar minstrelsy, To chant in this, my wild wood home. The song that pleas'd my infancy? Oh wildly sweet, thy thrilling note Stirs all the depths of memory; And forms of bliss and beauty float, Commingled with thy melody. Oh, I am in my native land Once more, a little joyous child, Amongst the bright and happy band On whom a fair young mother smil'd. I see my blessed native place, The nodding grove, the verdant vale, The grain-clad hill, the orchard trees, The shrubbery tossing to the gale. The city by the river-side With heavenward spire, and shining dome; The laden vessels, on the tide From ocean journeys sweeping home. My father's house, that dearest place, In all that dear and blessed land, Where love, and piety, and peace, Presided o'er the cherish'd band. Each inmate of that dear abode By memory's steady light I see,â Though some are long ago with God, And all are far away from me. Each dear familiar tree and flower, By river-side, or rocky glen, Is bright and beautiful this hour, In fancy, as I deem'd it then. And I can dream thy vesper sweet, So musically wild and shrill, Rings from the quince tree, then the seat Of my familiar whippoorwill. I see that smile, so fond so bright,â And now, a voice is in mine ear. âThe whippoorwill has sung good night,â âNow come to bed my children dear.â The lamp is plac'd, the prayers are said, A mother's hymn is wooing sleep. No thorns were on that pillow spread, I had not learned to watch and weep. The song is hush'dâthe vision fled, Reality resumes her reign. Come, my own little ones to bed, Your mother's heart is yours again. THE TURKISH LADY TO HER EUROPEAN LOVER. No! no! I cannot listen,âthou fair son Of the fair frozen North. There is no glow Of ardent passion in thy pale blue eyes. I look into their liquid depths as one Would search the still lakes of thy native land, And they are just as cold and passionless. If I should listen to thee, would thy heart Which never beat defiance unto pride Or rigid prudence, be a fair exchange For mine, with its wild pulses of delight, And omnipotent passions? Would the love Of our impassion'd hearts be understood By thee, to whom such fervour must appear A wild and empty fable? No! ah, no. Our hearts could never blend. Yet, could'st thou love With all the ardour of my sunny clime, Should I forsake my home, my blessed home, Which wealth has made a very paradise Of incense, fountains, flowers, and melodies, Health, and voluptuous ease, for those drear halls In which the northern ladies shiver round The heated stove, though wrapp'd in wool and furs, While winter, shaking snow-drifts from his wings, Shrieks round the trembling mansion? Oh, my heart Grows chilly, as I think of that cold climeâ Thou say'st I am a captive, bought with gold And cag'd like some young song bird. That my lord Reigns, a stern tyrant o'er the beauteous girls That languish in his harem. To mine ear Such words are strangeâaye, very foolishness. If my lord priz'd my beauty more than gold, Is that not proof he lov'd me?âI am told That your cold countrymen will take a wife Of loathsome person, and imbecile mind, If she but bring them money, which they prize Above all female loveliness and worth, Or fond and pure affection. I have heard That your most beauteous maids may bloom, and fade Neglected in your valleys; left to weep, And die, beneath the burden of hard toil, Despis'd, and trampled on, if they possess No glittering stores, to buy a husband with!â In noble generosity, my lord Gives golden thousands for one modest bud That grows in beauty by some mountain spring, Or streamlet of the valley. Cast away Thy prejudice, and look with candid eye Upon this fair and gentle sisterhood, Which Achmet calls his treasures. Each is fair, And each has her own style of loveliness, And our lord loves us all. His heart has room For every trait of beauty, form and hue, Just as your eye may take in a boquet Of many brilliant flowers, and love them all. Are we not happy? Have our hearts one wish That is not gratified? Do we not seem Like gentle spirits, in the paradise Which pious moslems visit in their dreams? We all adore our lord, and 'tis our joy To do his pleasure, and our sweet reward Is his dear smile of love. We know no care; But in his absence sport away the hours In every girlish pastime. We are slaves Alone to love and pleasure. Our glad hearts And soft small hands, are free from every stain Of sordid care or toil. We only live To dress, and laugh, and dance, and gather flowers And wear them till they fade, and then the wreath Is thrown aside, without a passing sigh And replac'd by a richer. Were it wise, Think'st thou, to barter slavery such as this For freedom that bows down beneath the chains Of toil, and care, and sorrow, and gaunt want? Oh! what has woman, frail and beautiful, To do with freedom?âGod, who made man free, Gave woman as his solace. When he bade Man earn his bread in sweat, and bitter toil, He made him lord of woman, and decreed That she should yield obedience to his sway And meekly do his bidding. Wherefore then Should woman talk of freedom, and affect The tone of liberty? Is it not plain That she is man's dependent, he her lord? Or can your sophistries and glozings cheat Her into a belief that she is free, While your stern sceptre lies upon her head Bending it downward, even when you smile. Thou call'st my lord a despot, and unjust, That while he gathers to himself a host Of fair young girls, and revels in their love, If one, on whom he seldom deigns to smile Shall dare to love anotherâstrait the sack Is ready for the victim of the sea. Yet this, I deem, is mercy. Could'st thou know The worthlessness of life to woman's heart, When it has lost its purity, and lies Tossed on the billows that can never know The blessed calm of peace,âwhen she endures The serpent writhings of the cherish'd sin Which she is sure will sting her unto death, And yet has not the power to tear away, From the polluted shrine, which never more Can be the seat of conscious innocence, Or truth, or holy calm,âwhen heaven is lost And sin's dark record written on her brow, 'Tis time that she should die. I would not live (Slave as I am to Achmet) if my heart Could feel the rush of passion at thy name, Or tremble at thy presence. The fierce war 'Twixt love and duty, the degrading sense Of perfidy, that would pierce through my soul When my lord smiled on me, crushing me down Beneath his feet, a poor polluted thing, While sharp fang'd fears, like never-dying worms Should prey upon my spirit.âSurely these Would make the white shroud, and the deep dark sea A refuge, to be long'd for.âBut thou say'st âA fit of groundless jealousy, or rage May give the waves a victim.ââBe it so. When love is chang'd to hate, or dark distrust, 'Tis better that the innocent should die, Than live and feel its scourgings. What is life That we should fear to leave it, when it seems Like some fair garden, where a blight has been, And made each beauteous blossom, and fair bud, A blacken'd piteous thing? While from beneath The blighted foliage, gleam the hideous eyes Of basilisk, and adder,âwhen the air Is pestilence, and every sound a moan. Thou art the insidious fiend, whose touch would change My paradise of innocence and peace To such a fearful ruin! Get thee hence! I cannot, will not love theeâWoman's bliss Is Purity.âHer dearest jewel, Truth. MICHAL, SAUL'S DAUGHTER. A Romance. CHAPTER I. It was a bridal chamber, garnish'd forth With gems, and gold, and purple, and rich wreaths, Where silver lilies breath'd upon the breast Of Sharon's velvet roses, and their sweets Were mingling with the incense, that stole forth From humbler blossoms, sweet as childhood's prayer. Oh, what enchanting scenes Of rich and varied beauty, lay outspread Beneath the windows, where the crimson folds Of the rich tapestry were drawn aside By chains of wreathen gold. The lovely vales With peaceful herds, and highly cultur'd fields, The rich corn waving on the gentle slope, The dark-leav'd graceful olive bending slow In adoration, as the breezes pass'd, Bearing its voice to heaven. The hill-side crown'd With rich green vineyards, where a blessing dwelt; The streamlets, lying on the mountain's breast, Like chains of sparkling diamonds, falling low Into earth's lap, the valley's, resting there In glittering clusters, mid her robes of green. The far off Libanus, with cedar plumes Nodding in heaven's blue mirror, with the pride Of a stanch warrior, while the smiling heaven Look'd down, as if with pride, on such a scene Of glowing beauty. The dim misty hills Where every crevic'd rock was wreath'd with bloom Inhabited, and stored with honey combs; While from the sycamore that bow'd and smil'd To its own image, in the mirror'd fount Gush'd swells of trancing bird songs, floating soft Upon the living breeze, which came by fits, Coquetting with the heavy tapestry Of that fair bridal chamber. Can it be That there are aching hearts, and tearful eyes, In such a place, amid such glorious scenes? Alas! for earthly grandeur, pomp, and power, Magnificence and beauty. Seated there Enfolded fondly in each other's arms, Are Saul's two queenly daughters. Ne'er did eye Rest on a brighter pair. So fair, so young, So form'd of beauty, grace, and majesty. The one a brideâdeck'd out most gloriously In regal splendour, while her dark clear eyes Though overflowing, like a troubled spring, Dwelt on her fair young sister with a look Full of deep happiness, and joyful love, As 'neath the ripples of the ruffled fount, Lies the reflection of the brilliant heaven. Sister, she whisper'dâsince the hour has come Which severs our communion, which has been So perfect, and so sweet, wilt thou not now Confide to me the sorrow, which of late Has liv'd amongst thy roses, eating still The crimson beauties, from thy down-cast face? Sister! My only one! My heart has griev'd To see how thine was aching, and mine eyes Have wept to see the salt springs well from thine. Nay, hide not thus thine eyes within my vest, What should a pure young heart like thine, conceal? Michal. Love, sister! I should hide it from myselfâ From thee and Israel's God. I have not been The artless innocent which thy fond love Has deem'd me, in its doting. Could'st thou know How I have envied thee, how I have long'd To snatch the cup of blessing from thy lip, Though its last smile went with it! Sister, dear! Loose not thy fond embrace, 'tis over now, And even then when I had felt to smile Beside thine early death-bed, sure I am That death has nothing keener than the pangs That wrung and scorched my spirit. Merab. Lov'st thou Adriel? Michal. Sister! No. If I lov'd him I would not now tell thee. My heart is his to whom thou wast betroth'd, E'er any knew to whom thy heart was given. Merab. Poor child! Thy lack of confidence in me Has cost thee dear indeed. One little word Had sav'd thee all thy pain and bitterness. David is formed to win a heart like thine, Which only loves the great and beautiful; But I prefer the violet to the rose, And love Adriel better far than him. Michal. Better! As if there were degrees in love! My passion is exclusive. I can see No excellenceâno love exciting worth In any man but David. I am not Temper'd as thou, who couldst have meekly stood With one beside the altar, while thy heart Was throbbing for another. No command, Even from our royal father, ever shall Force me to give my hand, without love in it. Merab. God wrought for me, my sister. While I bowed With womanly submission to the will Of him, whom God has made my sire and king, I prayed with fervour for support from heaven. And He in whom I trusted, brought about, Without my aid, this happy change for me. Look unto him, sweet sister. Michal. Merab! cease. I cannot feel as thou dost. I will strive With mortals like myself; and leave to God The issue of the combat. I would wed The man I love, if his heart was with mine, Though earth and heaven forbade it. Thou said'st well, That I can only love the beautiful And eminently great. And what I love I love to adoration. From that day In which we went, with all the maiden train, To hail our conquering father, when I saw The youthful Bethlehemite, in shepherd garb, Bearing in his fair hand the ghastly head Of dread Goliath, dripping blood the while,â Ayeâfrom that day I loved him! Beautiful He is, as aught that ever fancy dream'd, And great he look'd even then, despite his dress, And cheeks of maiden roses. When our band Struck the full chorus, and ascrib'd to him A tenfold honour, though our father's brow Grew dark with fear and anger, my heart glow'd With exultation, and I do believe That he will reign, in our fall'n father's stead. Nay, sister, wherefore tremble, and turn pale? Has not the Seer pronounc'd our father's doomâ That God will rend the kingdom from his hand And give it to another? In that day When Saul's proud head bows down, and the crown falls From his pale brow; amongst whose wavy curls Shall its bright circlet glitter? I can see Its light even now amid the shining locks O'er David's forehead clustering. Merab. Oh, forbear! What horrid visions of death, shame, and wo, Do thy words conjure up. My spirit faints With very horror, as my fancy paints My noble father low amongst the dead, Weltering in gore, from out his own high heart; And my young brothersâbeautiful and brave, Ghastly, and cold beside him; while the foe Shout forth their savage triumph. Michal. Yet that day Will surely come, my sister. I have seen A soul-benumbing vision. Even now My eyes and brain are reeling, and my heart Grows faint and cold, with its remember'd dread. Merab. Sister, what hast thou done? Michal. A deed from which The sternest soul might shrink. But it was love, Omnipotent and all-subduing love, With its tormenting doubts, and demon fears, That urged me to explore the dreadful depths Of the forbidden future. So I went To Endor, to the witch, who still eludes Our father's vigilance, and with her spells Enchants the living, and commands the dead. The awe, with which I sought her, was increas'd By her majestic presence; and her eyeâ Oh, what a power was in it. I have seen Hundreds of lovely women, and fair girls, But she is strangely beautiful, beyond Aught that my eyes have seen, or fancy seign'd. I trembled in her presence, ere her spells Disturb'd the world of spirits, and brought forth Her own familiar genii, who unbarr'd Futurity's dark gate, and bade me look Upon her sacred treasures. I beheld Sights that engrav'd themselves upon my soul As drawn by living lightning. I grow sick, I will not sketch the picture unto thee; It is enough that I must agonize With dire anticipation. But I saw David enthron'd, and crown'd in august state, Obey'd and honour'd; and I was his wife. But, sister, the bright eyes that mine adore Turn'd on me, full of scorn, and bitternessâ And I beheld no more. Merab. Oh Michal! Michal! Thou hast sinn'd fearfully. Yet I will pray That God will have compassion on thy youth; And so avert the punishment, which else Will darken all thy future, upon which Thou hast profanely gazed. Nay, wave not thus Thy beautiful proud head, and curl thy lip; Be not offended at poor Merab now, Nor let us longer mar with bitter words, This day of bridal gladness. Hark, how sweet The tones of David's harp blend with the breeze That plays so freshly with thy rose-wreath'd curls. My sister, be compos'd. I will require A royal boon, on this my bridal morn; The king, our father, will not say me nay, And I will ask that thou shalt be bestow'd Upon the minstrel warrior. Oh! what sounds Of spirit-soothing melody gush forth As he unlocks the mystic spells, that sleep Within the magic harp strings, while his voice Richer and sweeter still, in rapturous hymns, Like holy incense, mingling with the air Floats gratefully to heaven. And David's eyes, And voice, and heart, are heavenward. I am sure He cannot worship woman, for his soul Adores the God. He will but love his wife As a rich gift from Him, and prize her love Only as it is holy, and subdued, To the pure law of heaven. Will such a love Suffice a heart like thine? a glowing heart On fire with passion? Much I fear that thou Would'st claim the worship which his pious soul Will ever pay to God.âThe bridegroom comes, Go thou to meet him, sister, while I strive To chase these crimson joys, back, to the deep And silent sanctuary of the heart, Where none may read them. CHAPTER II. Who sits within the bridal chamber now, Adorn'd with broider'd robes, and flashing gems, And wreaths of snowy blossoms? She is fairâ Beauty's perfection looks, and moves, and speaks, Throughout her sumptuous person. All too fair She seems for this dark earthâtoo glorious To be a creature of the race which bows To death, to pain, and sorrow. Dark-ey'd maids Are busy round herâeach with ready hand Adding some ornament, some gem, some grace, Till art is quite exhausted. Bending now With looks of adoration, at her feet, They kiss her robe's bright border, and withdraw, And she is left alone. And there she stands Amongst the garner'd treasures of the earth, Peerless in radiant beauty. But, wherefore does the brooch of opal stone, That clasps the aerial drapery o'er her breast; Glitter so, like a dew-drop in the sun? 'Tis trembling with the quick convulsive throbs That heave the breast beneath it. The white hands Are clasp'd in the strong language of despair, Despite the dazzling bracelets, and rich rings That give and borrow beauty. Big bright tears Fall down and mingle with the diamond chains That sparkle on her bosom; while the pearl Contests the rose's place upon her cheek And beautiful curv'd lips. The sweet breath comes In deep quick sobs, and goes in plaintive moans Of melancholy music. Michal! love! Her bridegroom's arm is round her graceful form. She shudders, shrinks, and droops across his arm, So like a blossom, wounded at the heart And wilted in its glory. Her dark curls Sweep the rich pavement, and the bridal wreath Falls from amongst their clusters. Omen dire!â To bridegroom's hopeful heart. And now his cheeks Grow pale as water lilies, as he lifts And lays that marble face against his breast, Which throbs with love and terror. He has lov'd Long, well, and wearily; and with a love Which has so bent the spirit of the man, That he is fain to rest his dearest hopes Upon a bosom where the heart within Is aching for another, while he knows That it has been a throbbing pillow, for That other's glowing cheek.âAnd he believes, Such is the simple waywardness of man, That by devotion, and untiring zeal, And smiles, like summer sunshine seen, and felt, He can allure that heart from its first love, And teach its pulse to vibrate to the touch Of his well-tried affection. He should pray For wisdom from on high, and school his heart To patience, and forbearance, who attempts A task so tedious, so nigh lorn of hope.â Now to his heart Phaltiel clasps the form Of his unconscious bride, and on her lips Never till now resign'd to his caress, Presses fond kisses. Davidâmy lov'd lord! She murmurs forth, as she revives, and clasps Her alabaster arms around his neck. His spirit writhes, but he retains her form Until her opening eyes meet his, and then Her clasp unlooses, and her eyes fill fast, While her form trembles. Yet with strong resolve She conquers her emotion, and sits down Calmly, beside her lord.âOh, woman's heart! How mightily it struggles with its pangs, And locks up agonies that would burst through The iron breast of man. Her cheek is pale, But in the arm he holds, the tell-tale pulse Is throbbing wildly, and he feels how great, How bitter is her trial. Soft he speaks, And strives to win her mind back from the maze Of agonizing memories.âHow can sheâ David's adoring wifeâShe for whose sake He gave himself to danger, and perform'd High feats of valour, which provok'd the fear And envious hatred of the royal Saul, 'Till she was forced by stratagem to save Her husband, from the vengeance of her sire. And he is living. How can she bestow Her hand upon another, and receive The nuptial benediction? Yet the will Of man decreed, and woman must submit. The years that pass along with equal pace Spite of the myriad voices that cry out Speed on! speed on! Spite of the frenzied shrieks, And prayers, and wailings, of the throngs that plead A little longer! and lie down, and die, Or sit in utter darkness of despair, Bewailing all the flowers, and tender buds, And worshipp'd baubles, that lie crush'd, and strown Upon the darken'd pathway.âYears have passed: The slender blossom'd twig, has now become A full leaf'd bough, adorn'd with tender fruit. How beautiful, within her husband's house She seems, amongst her children; while the love Which like a river, from its numerous springs, Flows on for ever with a ceaseless song, Replying to the music of heaven's hosts, Which smile to see their shadows trembling deep Within its liquid mirror,âthat pure love Which laves no other bosom under heaven, Than that on which its own dear babe has lain, Was flowing sweetly now, through Michal's heart, As on her knee her youngest cherub smil'd, And little laughing fellows gamboll'd roundâ Now skipping up to kiss the idol babe, Or climbing, to embrace with round white arm The mother's pearly neck. Phaltiel gazes on the group with pride, Feeling that all its beauty, innocence, And promise is his own. With lingering gaze Of blissful love, he pauses at the door, As he obeys a summons, to attend A messenger, on business from his king. Michal, who met that fond triumphant look, Felt her cheek crimson. Years of placid life With every blessing crown'd, and those fair babes, Had bound her to her Phaltiel with a tie Of calm and grateful friendship. Yet when fame Proclaim'd the deeds, the glories, and the power, Of her young heart's ador'd and loving lord, Keen pangs pierc'd through her bosom. Yet the pride That made her long to share his regal throne Came ever to her aid; for she believ'd That he had ceased to love her,âthat he thought Of Michal, as the daughter of a house Denounc'd of God, and fallen. And she felt The cold and withering glance which she beheld At Endor, in her vision, in her soul; While her fond husband's deep and generous love Seem'd to reproach her that her heart was still The captive of a man who loved her not. Oh, God of mercy! was the bitter cry, That fell in startling accents on her ear, As he who left her late, so full of joy, Re-enter'd pale and trembling. Quick she springs And clasps her arm around him, while the babe, With one hand round her neck, grasps his dark curls And puts his little laughing face to his. Dear father, what has happened? was the cry, With which his little sons came clustering round, With looks of wild alarm. Michal. My honor'd lord, What can distress you thus? May I not share The grief that tortures you? Phaltiel. No, Michal! No. You will not share my sorrows, yet, I hope That you will pity them. Oh, selfish love! That I should wish to mar thy happiness With memories of me! Yet so to part! Oh, MichalâMichalâcanst thou bear to go From thine adoring husband? Canst thou part For ever, from thy children? Canst thou lay That little nestling cherub from thy breast, And turn from it for ever? That caress, That close and fond embrace must be the last Which that poor infant will receive from thee. David hath claim'd theeâand my king hath sent His veteran general, Abnerâto demand And bear thee straight to Hebron. Thou wilt go To thy first love, to all the glittering state And pride of royalty. But I shall be Bereft, and sorrowful, a widow'd man. And thy poor babes will cling about my knees, And ask for thee with tears; and sorrow's blight Shall mildew their young spirits, while they see Their father ever mourning for the light Of their lost mother's face. But Abner waits: Alas! that I should say itâdearest, haste; He waits thee in our hall. Her trembling heart Is well nigh bursting with the counter-tides Of joy and sorrow, and her changing cheek Betrays the alternate sway. Phaltiel's heart Grows cold, and heavy, as she seems to shrink Away from his embrace. With one long sigh He drops his trembling hands, and turns away, A crush'd and stricken man. One tender kiss She presses on her infant's smiling lips, Then lays it gently on its little couch; And glancing on her hush'd and wondering boys, Till tears come gushing from their deep heart fount, And overflow her eye-lidsâturns away. And hastens from the chamber, and is soon With Abner, at the gate. Phaltiel's soul Is bow'd to infant weakness; and he sobs Like a forsaken girl. His wifeâhis loveâ The mother of his childrenâshe to whom His youthful heart was wedded, and around Whose angel presence, every tender string, And fibre of his being has entwin'd, Till life and she are blendedâshe must go To love and bless another; and his heart, And house, and children, must be desolate. His grief is so intense that manhood's pride Falls down before it, as the lofty pine Yields to the hurricane. Lost in the night And wilderment of wo, he follows on, Weeping along behind her, till at length Abner, with stern command, bids him return. Then, with one lingering look, one silent prayer, He turns toward his desolated home, A broken-hearted man. And Michal feels Relief that he is gone, and in her ear The voice of his lamenting, died away. CHAPTER III. Why are the valleys sere? Why are the hills So bare and joyless? Wherefore stand the herds Lowing beside the wells? Why are the flocks Roaming along the beds of the dry brooks And bleating piteously? Why are the vines So light of clusters? Wherefore are the trees So bare of leaves, or fruit? Why are the birds So still amongst the boughs, with wings droop'd down? Why is the husbandman so wo-begone, And wherefore does he sow with bitter tears His bare, and burning fields? There's blood upon the land; the guiltless blood That Saul pour'd out at Gibeah, when he sought (Regardless of the solemn covenant, Sworn in Jehovah's name, by Israel's lords,) To root the remnant of the Amorites From their possessions, in their father land. That blood now cries for vengeance; and the soil In its pollution, asks of Heaven, in vain, The shower and vernal dew. Heaven will not hear Until these fatal stains are wash'd away, With streams of the offender's lineal blood. Who shall atone for Gibeah? Whose warm heart Shall pour the dread oblation? Who shall go From heaven's glad sunlight, from the hymning earth, From all the fond entwining ties of love, To death's cold silent shade, to give his blood In expiation of ancestral crime? Hark! there is mourning in the palace hallsâ The voice of bitter weeping gushes forth From arch'd and rich wreath'd casement. Michal, Queen? King David's wife, and daughter of king Saul, What wrings thy bosom now? See where she kneels, All pale and negligent, with head bow'd down Upon her broider'd cushions. Gold and gems Lie strown around her, disregarded now. Her haughty soul is humbled, for she prays, And weeps, before Jehovah.â Who is this That steals into the chamber, spirit-like? Her perfect face is wasted, and so pale That one might deem it marble; and the hand, That grasps her mourning drapery is so thin,â So like a wither'd lily,âand her eyes, Her large dark lustrous eyes, are full of wo,â Of such expression, as if they had seen The last of all they lov'd to look upon, Wither'd away before them. Yet there dwells A meek expression on her faded lips, And in the bend of her majestic form, That seems to sayâAmen. 'Tis doneâshe said, Advancing close to Michal, as she knelt, And placing that thin hand, so piteously, Upon her shining tressesâIt is done, The expiatory sacrifice is now Accepted of Jehovah. Hush your moans, And bid your tears cease flowing. God has heard Our prayers, and seen the sorrows of our hearts; And our submission, and deep penitence Have risen like sweet incense to his throne, And he has pitied us. Look up to heaven, See how his swift-wing'd messengers of peace Are gathering above us. Even now They shake from dark'ning plumes, the cooling drops Brighter than diamonds, and more precious far. Let us adore his name, and humbly own That he is just, that he is merciful, Although our hearts are bleeding. Have we not Been proud, profanely proud, and arrogant, Although we are but frail and worthless weeds Upon his pathway? MichalâI have felt The very bitterness of sin and wo, As all alone I sat upon the rock, Watching by day and night, to keep away The hateful beasts and birds, that prowl'd around With gloating glaring eyesâand screaming forth Their horrid longings for the blackening flesh Of our unconscious children. Oh! what hours Of agony, passed o'er meâas the shades Of night lay heavy round me, where I sat, With dry and quivering eye-balls, glancing round, In extreme terrorâas the fox, the dog, And fierce hyena, crouch'd with flaming eyes, And low and sullen growlings; while the gleam Of those dead faces, with their livid light Added to terror all the pangs of grief. Oh! it was dreadful! past the power of speech, To picture to the mind. Yet still I kept My watch unshrinking, for the fervent love Which my heart cherish'd, for the beautiful, The brave, but erring Saul. A love, which, since Its chosen sanctuary in his breast, Was cold and broken, has dwelt tremblingly Amongst his children, and which hover'd still Around the ruin'd temples of its hopes, And kept its mournful watch. But yesternight About the midnight hour, my weary frame Sunk under its exhaustion. Yet the prayer Still linger'd on my lips, and still my soul Was wakeful on the watch. And, lo, there came A rushing breeze, oh! sweeter than the breath Of holy incense, in the golden vase, Before the Mercy Seat; and with it blent A wreathen melody, which fill'd my soul With peace, and consolation. Mortal lips Ne'er breath'd so soft a strain, and naught of earth Could ever penetrate and sooth the mind With such a flood of sweetness. I arose, And lo! amid a halo of soft light, Stood seven effulgent creatures. Oh! what bliss Thrill'd through my spirit, as their glorious eyes Beam'd lovingly upon me, and I knew Our disembodied children. Oh! how vain Poor Nature's joys, and sorrows, hopes and fears, And loves, appear'd that moment, as I look'd Upon the spiritual eternal world, Where God is all in all, and where his will Is understood; where these dark walls of clay, No more can cast their shadows on the page Of his wise purposes. I am content, My children are at peace. Beyond the reach Of envy and ambition, strife or death. Could'st thou have seen the light of blessedness Which play'd about their faces: could'st thou see The smiles with which they beckon'd me; the bliss Which was apparent, as they look'd to heaven, And vanish'd from my sight, thou would'st bow down, And pour thine ardent gratitude to God. Day broke upon the earth, and I arose. But oh! how different were my feelings now, As once again I look'd upon the clay That had enshrin'd my angels. That, was mine; Alas! how weak, and vile, how worthless now! To God belong the spirits, bright and strong, And perfect, as I saw them. I have thought That you and I were cruelly bereft, Of our own treasures, for I could not feel That God is lord of all. And yet we know That he who rears a bullock for himself Will put it to his use, despite the moans Of the poor dam that nurs'd it, and we feel That he has done no wrong. Then should not God The merciful, the perfect, use his own At his good pleasure? Though to you or me His creatures also, was assign'd the task O swatching fondly for a little while The beings of his will. Michal. Amen. Amen. His righteous will be done. He is all wise. Michal is childless, and the house of Saul Is now, well nigh, extinct. No son of mine As once I fondly hoped, shall blend the blood Of Saul, and David, and reign peacefully, Combining every rival interest In one broad flood of glory. But the Lord Had otherwise determin'd, and His will Is holiness. Oh, Rispah! I have proved The vanity of all earth's gorgeous things, Her beauty, and her loves. All have been mine In their perfection. Yet behold me nowâ Michal, Saul's daughter, reft and desolate, Joyless and hopeless; bending to the place Of darkness, and oblivion. Pride has wrought The downfall of my house. Pride has destroy'd My earthly happiness, and almost been My everlasting ruin. But the Lord Has followed me in mercy; and my heart Is humbled now, and contrite, and I feel Despite these tears, a peace so deep, and sweet, That I would not exchange it for the bloom Of all my perish'd hopes. Hark! to the dirge, The sweetly solemn anthem of the train, Sent by my royal husband to convey The gather'd relics of Saul's family To holy sepulture, beside their sires. The mournful melody breathes to my soul, King David's sorrow for the royal house Which sinned itself away. I know he mourns Deeply, for me and mine; though on him rest The blessings we rejected. May the Lord Bless him for ever; when the name of Saul Is utterly forgotten. MY DIAMOND CHAIN. My ornaments! My ornaments! My precious diamond chain! How gaily it has clasp'd my neck, And on my bosom lain; It was my joy, it was my pride, My never wearying care, To guard and keep my diamond chain For ever pure, and fair. For this I toil'd, for this I pray'd, For this I fear'd and wept, For this I kept my weary watch, While all around me slept. In every storm I clasp'd the chain Still closer to my heart, And felt that from the smallest gem I could not bear to part. Where is it now? My diamond chain! Alas, the mournful day, In which death wrench'd the clasps in twain, And bore one gem away. Years glided, and the priceless things Departed, one by one, As love, or death, alternate claim'd The brightest, as their own. No earthly power, no worldly wealth, My treasures can restore, I miss their warmth, I miss their light;â Oh, I am lone, and poor! Alas that aught should ever break So bright and dear a chain, Which once dissever'd, never can On earth be join'd again. Oh! never more in links of love Around me shall it twine; Oh, keep th' imperishable things Eternal Father, thine. Oh, hear; for the Redeemer's sake A lonely mourner's prayer, And when thou mak'st thy jewels up, May all my gems be there. THE WILD WOOD LYRE. Yes, I will go down to the hemlock dell, Where the pure young breezes play, Where the waters gush with a witching swell, Of dreamy melody. Where the wild bird warbles her lullaby, As the free winds rock her nest, And the mountain doe comes stealing by, To her quiet place of rest. Where the wild bee swings in the dewy flower, With a low delicious hum, And the diamond drops of the blessed shower Like welcome strangers come, Through branches, which more than a hundred years, Have shadow'd the holy spot, Lest the sun-beam should kiss away the tears, Of sweet forget-me-not. At the foot of a laurel where violets grow, In this sweet romantic dell, The wild wood lyre is murmuring low, Its spirit-wild'ring spell. Oh, dreamily tender its hymning rings, The fairy-trod dell along,â I will go and waken its living strings, For harmony and song. Awaken! wild harp of the wood-land bower! (My hand was amongst its chords) Oh, burden the winds with thy magic power, And soul-entrancing words. Oh, tell of young innocence, truth, and love, Or the precious meed of Fame; Or chant that title all price above The patriot's spotless name. Or mingle those themes so pure and high, Into one soul-thrilling taleâ Hark! from the wild lyre a shivering sigh, A low, and plaintive wail.â It will not respond to a touch of mine, Or obey my prompting mind, 'Tis nature's own lyre, and is half divine,â Its minstrel is the wind. And now the melodious spirit comes, I hear his viewless wings, Like the music of myriad angels' plumes, In earthward wanderings. The tall trees are waving their crested heads, Majestically slow; The wild flowers worship, and through the shades Their fragrant offerings flow. Ah! now he is wooing the living strings, Which reply so soft, and low; As the young bruis'd heart's last murmurings In melting music flow. LAY OF THE LYRE. How like a glorious dream That flies before the tide of busy day, From the eternal mountain, vale, and stream, The crown has pass d away! Like some deep mystery Seems that wild race, that through the forest rov'd, Inseparable in its history, From the green bowers they lov'd. None knoweth whence they came; Coeval with the forest they have been; In glory, and in destiny the same, They held their glorious reign. But, as the forest fell, Yielding the sceptre of its ancient sway, Leaving each tender flower, and fairy dell, To the broad blaze of day. And when the green-rob'd crowd, Departed from the plains, and valley lands; When patriarch beech, and giant hemlock bow'd Beneath the axe-man's hand. When the majestic pine, The living banner Freedom's hand had flung, Above her mighty altars, where the shrine Of heaven's pure gladness hung. When these were rudely riven From the high places where their giant forms, Had brav'd the thunders, and the winds of heaven, And wrestled with the storms. With them fell down the pride, The vital glory of those free-born breasts; The forest fell; the dark-brow'd hunter died, Mingling their fallen crests. And still the sweeping tide Of cultivation, holds its swift career, And soon from this broad land rich Nature's pride, And sons, will disappear. I wail in pensive strain With her own tuneful voice, and plaintive tone, The desecration of her ancient reign; Her noble children gone. Art with his steel and fire, Has swept her glorious majesty away; But Art can never teach the wild wood lyre, To love her heartless sway. While wild flowers blossom here, Within the balmy bosom of the shade, And the free song-birds congregate, to hear From every sunny glade. While these old trees bend down, And sighing listen to my fitful song, And limpid streams pour forth a plaintive tone, Each cadence to prolong. The wild wood lyre shall wail, The forest-wreath of glory pass'd away; And mourn the noble race whose tragic tale, Shall fill in years to come the thrilling lay. A MOONLIGHT DREAM. I sat at the foot of an old beech tree, While winds in its branches sigh'd mournfully, And soft leaves met trembling, and languid fell, Like hands of young lovers, that say Farewell. And the bird that at even-tide sings alone, Was pouring her mellow and dreamy tone.â My spirit went back to the seasons goneâ And my bosom it seem'd like a cold grave-stoneâ Which lieth alone in some dreary place, Engraven with legends of former days. Of long perish'd loves, and of hopes half blown, Which Memory gather'd, and made her own. Oh Memory! when in the ways of life The spirit grows weary of care and strife, The brow is begirt with a wither'd wreath, The heart has become as the house of death, When fountains are dry, where we lov'd to drink, And we languish in agony on the brink. When sorrow has spread over all bright things, The mildewing damp of her heavy wings; We worship thee, gentle and dreamy power, Who steal'st along in that lonely hour, With pitcher fresh fill'd at the fount of youth, With beauty, and innocence, love, and truth. And is there, I murmur'd, no holy home, Where sorrow, and suffering, never come, Where tenderness burns with a steady glow, Untouch'd by the finger of change or wo. Where poetry weaves, with a living sound, Her tissue of beauty and bliss, all round? The full moon arose like a living scroll, On which I had written my youthful soul, When weaving bright webs of her silver beams, I broider'd them over with golden dreams; Enwreathing love's rose in its richest hue, With the modest young violet's truthful blue. While hope linger'd by with her gentle mien, And touch'd with her pencil each shadow'd scene. Oh, brightly they glitter'd around me then, By Memory spread in that magic glen, Till every wild flower, with its dewy eye, Became a lov'd face of the years gone by. So gracefully now, like a wandering dove, A silver-wing'd vapour appear'd above,â Well might it claim from the Moon its birth, And bear a fond message from her to earth. Lo! it approach'd me, a shadowy boat, Design'd on the moon's silver sea to float, Oh, brightly its gossamer streamers flow'd, And purely its pearly white bottom show'd, With radiant spirits to guide its way, And now at my feet the bright phantom lay. Come!âcried the spirits in accents sweet, And gaily I sprang to the shining seat. So gracefully then, like a pleasant dream, Or white thistle down, on a gentle stream, Arose on a zephyr, that shallop fair, And speeded away on the waveless air. We speedily came where the meteors bright Were crossing our track in their dizzy flight, Careering along with their choral hymn Through regions that else would be still and dim, The flamy-wing'd creatures went flashing by, Each guiding its chariot gloriously. The moon, toward which we had held our flight, Was suddenly lost in a flood of lightâ A light so entrancingly pure and clear, It seem'd like the spirit's own atmosphere. And now we look'd down on a world as bright As earth in the robe of a winter night; But there was no chill in the balmy air That lay like an ocean of fragrance there, As limpid and pure, as the floods that swell From the deep down spring of a mountain well. Yet ocean, nor river, nor dancing rill, Appear'd in that country by vale and hill, But no one could thirst, where an air like this, Bath'd bosom and brow in its balmy bliss. Then softly we floated above a scene That dazzled the eye with its holy sheen; Where lofty trees rose over lovely bowers, And valleys were carpeted o'er with flowers; But blossom and bud were as bright as snow, And leaves wore a beautiful silver glow, And the stems and the grasses were feather'd o'er Like frost-spangled reeds on a river shore. The ground was as bright as the wave-wash'd sand That glitters along by an ocean strand, And zephyrs went by with a gentle sound, Like rivulets murmuring all around; And heavy leav'd trees by their pinions fann'd, Were shadowless all in that magic land. And beautiful creatures were moving there, With silvery garments, and long fair hair, And lips with a tinge like the small pink shells That lie where the musical south sea dwells. And tenderness trembled in each soft eye Like beautiful stars in the clear blue sky. Oh welcome! they cried as they gather'd round, With voices of melody's own rich sound. Oh welcome, dear sister, to this bright home Where spirits of melody only come. We never know pain in this happy land, Where death cannot come with his drooping bandâ Where change never touches our souls, or forms, And flowers ne'er perish by time, or storms, Where never a shadow, by day or night, Has darken'd the tender and holy light. And here are no hues of the changeful crest That blooms but to wither, on earth's foul breast, Unfolding a moment to fade away, And poison life's fountain with sure decay. Nor here bloom the buds of the fading earth In beauty that dies in its hour of birth, But beauty unchangeable, pure, and bright, Abiding for ever, in balm and light. And this is the country thou long hast sought, Repining for ever in dreamy thought, A region where perfect affection reigns, And melody mingles immortal strains; Aye, here we may bathe in the peace of heaven. Ah! Ha! 'Tis the gloomy owl's voice of fear, That startles so harshly my drowsy ear; The dews of the night on my eye-lids lie, And the Moon seems to smile at my vagary. IMAGINATION. AN ANSWER. âWhat is Imagination?â I have deem'd That 'tis heaven's ante-chamber. A bright place To which our spirits enter, undisrob'd Of this world's loves and hopes, and sympathies. A beautiful elysium, where the flowers Are never-fading, where the genial sun Knows neither cloud nor setting; where the spring Of everlasting youth is gushing up, Beneath the bowers of life, and dancing on, Amid rich odours, to eternity. The atmosphere is magic, as it bathes The brow and bosom with Lethean balm; And beauteous angels wait there, radiant With such pure blissful life, as gushes forth From heaven's half-open portal; and their wings Glance ever at our bidding, swift as light, How sweetly do they bear us in their arms From this dull workshop of the heart and brain, To their own blest dominion, where each breeze Is laden with delight. How tenderly They lay us in the arms of those we love, While the full heart is throbbing, and the eye Pouring from its rich depths an ardent flood Of ecstasy, unmingled, unalloy'd. Then hands are clasp'd, and lips are fondly press'd, That never meet, save in that magic land; And words are breath'd, and ecstacies are felt, That earth knows nothing of. There comes no doubt, No withering suspicion, no mistrust, Into that joyous world. All there is pure, Faultless, and beautiful, and full of bliss. The weight of years, the lines of withering care, The world's impression on the weary mind, The mildew blights, that stain the spirit's bloom, The canker, that corrodes the hackney'd heart, Are never felt, or even remembered there. Youth, love and beauty, in perennial bloom, Dwell there for ever; and the hymns of heaven Float in rich echoes through the breathing bowers Of this soft paradise, this dreamy land, Where spirits meet and mingle, with the wreath Of fond humanity, in all its bloom, Twin'd o'er the heart and brow; while every leaf And bud and blossom, glitters with the light, And breathes the balm of immortality. SONG. WHERE ART THOU? Oh! where art thou, my life, my love, This grand, this solemn night? My thoughts are with thee, as I rove Beneath the moon's pure light. Bright clouds upon the fitful wind, On wandering pinions stray; I watch them with an absent mind, For thou art far away. Where art thou, love? The night is fair, And soft the breezes blow; And many a holy watchful star Looks down, with fervent glow: I raise my eyes to Heaven above, I lift my hands to pray; Devotion dies in bleeding love, For thou artâfar away. Within thy bosom lies my heart, I am but one with thee; My soul is with thee, where thou art, And what is left of me? I sighâthe wind that sigh returns, As ripe leaves rustling play, But beauty diesâmy spirit mourns, For thou artâfar away. Oh! where art Thou? And what am I? What means this bosom's swell? The trembling heart, the blush, the sigh, Ah me! I know too well. Too well I know that I am thine, And doom'd from thee to stray; Ten thousand torturing thoughts combine, For thou artâfar away. Oh! where art thou, my life, my love, Where smile thy radiant eyes? Are they not rais'd like mine, above, Where love immortal lies? Oh! meet me there, with ardent heart; At every close of day; Until we meet, no more to part, Where peace and rapture stay. JOSEPHA. A BALLAD. Josepha was a Spanish maid, The daughter of a noble Don, And never signor's eye was staid A more enchanting form upon. To call her graceful would be wrong, She was the very soul of grace, And minstrelsy's most ardent song, Might vainly seek to paint her face. Her lips where dwelt love's rosy smile, Whence breath'd his soul-entrancing tone; The cheek that glow'd and blanch'd the while With living beauties all its own; The clustering locks that sought to hide The whiteness of her queen-like brow, And with a wealth of jetty pride Contrasted with her neck of snow; And then the blue-vein'd drooping lid, So richly fring'd, and loath to rise, As if in jealousy it hid The speaking radiance of her eyes.â Within Don Manuel's sumptuous towers, Protected by his rough dark wall, She bloom'd amid her sister flowers, The sweetest, loveliest, best of all. Her ardent mind was deeply fraught With all the romance of the age, By burning lay of minstrel taught, And chivalry's impassion'd page. Yet, nineteen summers had matured Her beauty, and enrich'd her mind, And no gay gallant had secured The heart that many sought to bind. Her tender feelings seem'd to sleep Like a young lion in her breast, Awaiting love's warm touch, to leap In fearful beauty, from their rest. While many a haughty heart was lorn, And many a proud dark eye ador'd, None yet had dared to tempt her scorn, Or brave her father's haughty word. And thus she liv'd as free from art As fairest roses in her bowers; Her innocent and girlish heart O'erflowing for her birds, and flowers. No grief or passion e'er could touch Her spirit bloom with frost, or flame, And even her very faults were such, As might be call'd by gentle name. At length a Don of noble race, Who boasted of ancestral fame, But never thought worth while to trace One noble deed, to grace his name; Who wrote his history in wine, With many a blot of darker hue; While flattery dared not trace one line, To speak him noble, good, or true, Who yet was handsome as the day, In robe of summer glory dress'd, While deep dissimulation lay In guise of virtue in his breast. I saidâat lengthâthis haughty Don, Array'd in all his princely state, With all his mimic virtues on, Appear'd before Don Manuel's gate. Right boldly he preferr'd his suit, And claim'd Josepha as his bride, Her father answer'd, I am mute, These claims my daughter must decide. Josepha's inexperienc'd eye Dwelt on his perfect form and mien, His gay and sumptuous panoply, Of princely garb, and jewel sheen; And pride and admiration join'd To aid him, in his ardent plea, And in her unsuspecting mind She deem'd him all that man should be. And when one year had pass'd away, And none could fault his deeds the while, Don Carlos nam'd the nuptial day, And she assented with a smile. Then Leon sought his native towers, Amid Castilia's scenery fair, His sumptuous halls, and queenly bowers For her reception to prepare. Josepha lov'd her pleasant home, And dearly priz'd her father's love, Her motherâyonder stands a tomb, And there are blissful realms above. One day she walk'd to muse alone Along the ocean's rocky shore, Which echo'd with a spirit tone The living flood's eternal roar; The fervid smile of summer lay On all earth's fair but fading things, And bursts of silvery melody Came floating from the lyres with wings. Josepha sigh'd, she knew not why, And turn'd to leave the lonely place, When lo! a vision met her eye Of most surpassing loveliness. 'Twas beauty's self, in beauty's dress, A simple robe of purest white, While every richly flowing tress Gave back the sunbeams doubly bright. Attracted as by magic spell Josepha moved to where she stood, Upon a rock with beetling swell Projecting o'er the ocean flood. The stranger rais'd her deep blue eyes With fringes droop'd with many a tear, Oh God, accept my thanks, she cries, That Donna Josepha is here. Fair ladyâif thy gentle ear Can listen to a stranger's grief, Sit down awhile beside me hereâ My tale of sorrow shall be brief. They sat them down together there Beneath the linden branches green, And such another perfect pair On sea-girt shore were never seen; Josepha in her native pride, Dark ey'd, and tall, and richly dress'd; And that meek creature at her side, With drooping mien, and simple vest. And yet there lived a noble grace, In that fair maiden's form and eye, While thus, with artless earnestness, She told her tale of agony. I am a stranger, from the land Of hills and vales. Where crown'd with snow The eternal Alps look darkly grand Upon the fruitful vales below. I was a happy-hearted child In my own home, in that sweet vale, Where nature's loveliest things grew wild, And calm, and music fill'd the gale. But when my mother went to heaven, My father's heart was stricken through, His peace was lost, his spirit riven, His home a grief spot in his view. And so we sought this sunny shore, But he is bent with grief and years; Oh thou! whom pious hearts adore, Support his age, and dry his tears! She trembled like a tender leaf Expos'd to stormy wind and rain; Till weeping gave her heart relief And she resum'd her tale again. We dwell in yonder cottage white, And there to soothe my father's wo Has been my business, my delight, The only joy I cared to know. For now he fills an humble sphere Far, far below his noble birth, And strangers to his history here, Nor feel his grief, nor know his worth. At length a handsome stranger came Of noble mien, in humble dress, And when he urged a suitor's claim My heart return'd his tenderness. Love in my lonely heart had lain A hidden, and untested well, He ope'd the fount, and gladly then It gush'd with overwhelming swell. My life, my world, my very soul, Lay whelm'd in that delicious flood, And his dear image fill'd the whole With visions of beatitude. My father bless'd our mutual love, His child was happy, and his heart Had sent that only prayer above, And now was ready to depart. Last month, dear lady, we were wed. Oh God! How brief my dream of bliss, How like the blasting lightning sped, The death-doom of my happiness. Don Leon is the heartless man Who won me in a low disguiseâ This morn he pass'd me with his train, And scorn'd me with his cruel eyes. Thou know'st him. I have told my tale, And this of thee I would require, To seek our cottage in the vale And comfort my forsaken sire. She turn'd toward the cliff, and sigh'd, My rest is where the billows swell!â Josepha held her back, and cried, Who bade thee seek for rest in hell? Mad girl! Is this thy filial love? Go first and take thy father's life, And leave him not alone, to prove A death with keener anguish rise. I lov'd Don Leon, but my life, My father's peace, my hopes of heaven, Shall never in wild passion's strife A sacrifice for him, be given. No let us seek with humbled heart, The wise and pitying Power above; He will remove the venom'd dart, And bless us with a holier love. I will not be Don Leon's brideâ And thouâforbear thy purpose dire, A happy issue may betideâ But keep thy sorrows from thy sire. The stranger bless'd the timely check, And reason now resumed her sway, With arms around Josepha's neck, She breathed her thanks, and turn'd away. Josepha felt her bosom swell With many a bitter pang of grief, But woman's pride, with potent spell Arose and came to her relief. And then, her bosom had not known The love that overwhelms the soul, That clings to oneâand one alone, And baffles reason's strong control. She laid a wild but generous plan, Then told her father, Leon's guile: And while he curs'd the treacherous man, She sooth'd him with her girlish wile. She told him all she meant to doâ He listen'd with approving heart, And lent his aid, to carry through, The strange device of woman's art.â Don Leon came again in prideâ Josepha met him with a smileâ But all her love for him had died, Her heart abhorr'd his serpent guile. Yet gay and gallant was his mien, And full of love his voice and eye; While sadness on his brow was seen, And oft he heav'd a restless sigh. For Anna of the meek blue eyes Had bound him with a magic spell; And all his tender sympathies Were in the cottage of the vale. And there he stood at eventide, 'Twas desolate. His heart grew coldâ Anna! dear injur'd love! he cried,â We are aloneâthe echoes told. Through all the vale he sought in vain That old man, with his daughter fairâ No information could he gain, But that, one morn, they were not there. Returning from his fruitless search, His fever'd form he sadly flung Along the now deserted porch, Where Anna's favourite Jasmine clung. And records of the days gone by From gloomy archives of the past, Came glaring on his mental eye, Until his spirit stood aghast. Oh, in those moments, what were all His glittering hoards, and princely state? Life's sweetest cup was chang'd to gall, His heart was wholly desolate. Alas! my cruel treachery Has come to Anna's ears, he cried, And she has fled incens'd away, Or, hap'ly, broken-hearted died. Oh, were she but of noble birth, She should have been my honour'd bride,â Ha! what a plague-spot on the earth, Is this accurs'd ancestral pride! But for Josepha's maiden fame, And proud Don Manuel's fearful wrath, I could forego my princely name, And follow gentle Anna's path.â The bridal morn rose clear, and bright, With feudal pomp, and lordly state; And glittering dame, and harness'd knight, Came flocking to the castle gate. And old Granada's royal bowers Were vocal with the joyous peal, That rock'd the old cathedral towers, And made Alhambra's turrets reel. And gladness reign'd by hall, and grove, And every minstrel hailed the day,â And song of joy, and tale of love, On every zephyr's bosom lay. The feast was spread in Manuel's halls, And red wine flow'd profusely there; And tourney list, and marshall'd balls, Rejoiced the brave, the gay, the fair. Don Leon's heart was sad the while, And frequent came the tell-tale sigh; Josepha mark'd with covert smile, For well she guess'd the reason why. His thoughts were with his mourning dove, Where is she in her sorrow now? His soul was yearning for her love, Her silvery voice, and timid brow. The chapel was a splendid sightâ The altar with its cloth of gold, Border'd with gems of brilliant light, And fringes dazzling to behold. And there were rang'd, like radiant gems, That sparkle round a royal crown, Fair blushing maids, and stately dames, And knights and dons of high renown. Beside the altar Leon stood, In dazzling garb, with haughty brow, While on his cheek the burning blood Betray'd the throbbing heart below. At once the folding door flew wide, And bridesmaids in their pure array, Led in the veil'd and trembling bride As simply habited as they. With shrinking grace she trode the aisle, The very queen of modesty, And loudly herald's voice the while, Proclaimed her name, and pedigree. Anna! of Don Ordogno's race, Old Leon's good and conquering king, And proud Galicia's richest grace, Arganta, famed for suffering. From these in pure untarnish'd flow On the maternal side she came, Rudolphus' name Burgundians know, And Bertha of immortal fame. These were her father's ancestors; Don Leon claims a royal bride! A princely pedigree is her's Without a stain, on either side. Transfix'd, and mute Don Leon gaz'dâ With joy and wonder unexpress'd; The bride advanc'd, her veil was rais'd, He clasp'd his Anna to his breast. And never to a happier pair Was minister'd the holy rite, And never blush'd a bride more fair, And never smiled a prouder Knight. Then to the feast, while round the halls, The harpers harp'd, and poets sang, Till gilded domes, and garnish'd walls, With their redoubling echoes rang. They swell'd the praise of Leon's line, Of princely fathers, wise, and good; And sung fair Anna half divine, In virtue, charms, and noble blood. Then wearied with the choral lays, At once they chang'd the hymning strain, And chanted forth Josepha's praise, Till all the echoes woke again. Then from the table Garcia rose, A far-famed Don of Moorish blood, Whose name was terror to his foes, For oft he'd drawn life's crimson flood. The Donna Josepha!âhe cried, The fairest, and the first in fame!â I'll break a lance for her with pride; Will any knight dispute my claim? I take thy challenge, Pedro cried, And name myself the Donna's knight,â The lists of honour should decide Our claim to such a beauty bright. Then to the field, with trumpet's clang And harness'd steed in prancing pride, And gems that flash'd, and mail that rang, Flock'd knight and lady, groom and bride. Don Manuel, and his daughter bright Were present in august array, With bride and bridegroom on their right, Beneath a splendid canopy. The champions met, the stubborn steel Awhile the clashing blows withstood; A shock at length made Pedro reel, Anotherâand he fell in blood. Then swell'd the shout of triumph wide, And heav'd to heaven Don Garcia's name, And he demanded in his pride, If no one else preferr'd a claim. Josepha's cheek grew pale and cold, As no one to the combat came, For Garcia was a warrior bold, With heart as rugged as his fame. His swarthy brow bent rough and scarr'd, O'er blood-shot eye, and sunken cheek, And grizzled were his hair and beard, With many an age-betraying streak. His life had all been spent in war, Where scenes of bloodshed, strife, and noise, Are illy fitted to prepare The heart for calm domestic joys. Yet on the field alone he stood, With flashing steel, and neighing steed, And lip that seem'd athirst for bloodâ Yet no one seem'd dispos'd to bleed. But hark! the trump swelled loud and clear, And now the heralds high proclaim, A stranger asks to break a spear, In honour of Josepha's name. Let him advance! Don Garcia saidâ And lo, a knight of graceful mien, In light and shining armour clad Advanc'd, th' admiring ranks between. Graceful he bow'd, while snowy plumes Danc'd lightly o'er his golden helm,â Josepha's cheek its bloom resumes, While hope and fear, her heart o'erwhelm. Don Garcia sternly pois'd his lance, And rein'd his strong and jetty steed; The stranger carelessly advanc'd, His barb seem'd only built for speed. Now by the Mass, the gazers cried He goes to death right gallantly! And many a lovely donna sigh'd, For his apparent destiny. The signal given, his charger sprang Like lightning on the scornful foe; The spear points on the harness rang And Garcia felt a well-aim'd blow. Another chargeâand Garcia's spear. Snapp'd, 'gainst the foe's well-temper'd mail; Then rose a loud exulting cheer, But Garcia's spirit did not quail. Another lance! His voice demands. 'Twas brought him, and another shock, Shiver'd the weapon in his hands, As if its point had met a rock; And backward by the stranger's spear The Knight was from his saddle flung,â By heavens! This feat shall cost thee dear! He cried, as from the earth he sprung. He mounted. By the saints, he said, It was thy weapon, not thy mightâ Now meet me with the heavy blade, I'll show thee playâmy lady knight! The stranger dropp'd his well-tried spear, And drew a fine Damascus blade; My heart was never touch'd by fear, Nor my good sword disgrac'dâhe said. Saint Mary shield thee, gentle Knight, Was breath'd from many a bosom fair, As Garcia drew his weapon bright And whirl'd it flashing through the air. Thou'rt lost! full many a warrior said, For worthless is that golden casque; Garcia will find to cleave thy head With his strong blade, a lightsome task. The stranger stood with steady eye, And caught, and parried every blow; Until a thrust made dexterously Pierc'd Garcia's scaly breast plate through. Now yield thee, lest my wily blade Should find a blood-spring in thy breastâ I yield to thee, Don Garcia saidâ Vain boy! For thee to yield were best. I would not hurt so good a knight In tourney frayâthe stranger said, Then be our fray a serious fightâ We part not until blood be shed. Wellâas thou wilt, the stranger criedâ And in an instant the red gore Leap'd to his hand, from Garcia's side, Just where he gash'd the mail before. There was a pauseâwhile Garcia reel'd, But when he fell, a deafening cry Sprang up from the exulting field And hailed the Prince of Chivalryâ With pensive air the victor stood Where vanquish'd Garcia writhing lay, While skill'd attendants stanch'd his blood, And bore him from the field away. Would knight or don dispute my claim? Or wrest a boon, so dearly won? He cried, and paus'dâNo answer came, And then a herald shouted.âNoneâ Then with a gay and gallant air He pass'd to where Josepha stood, Donnaâhe saidâI sigh to wear Some favour, by thy hand bestow'd, Most worthy knight, Don Manuel cried Thou'st prov'd thee first of mortal men, Demand my daughter as thy bride, Her dower will be thy favour thenâ And could she honour such demand With her whole precious heart, he said, I would not clasp a maiden's hand Whose heart was to another wed. Then be thy glittering helm unbound, And let thy visor be remov'dâ He threw them lightly to the ground, Josepha look'd, Josepha lov'd. My father, blushingly she said, This peerless knight of faultless mien, Your daughter would be proud to wed If she were earth's most honour'd queen. Now, noble knight, Don Manuel said, Thy deeds have proved thee good of heart, And since my child would be thy bride, Pray tell us whoâand whence thou art. With noble grace he bent his head, And majesty was in his glanceâ I wear no blazon'd name, he said, My castles are my sword and lance.â And thou dost honour to the same, And well they grace thy generous hand, Outshining all heraldic fame, Outweighing castles, gold, or land. But, lovely maid, the stranger said, Canst thou with these be satisfied? Will love and honour stand instead Of all thy present pomp and pride? And wilt thou wed a wayward knight, And follow where his fate may lead? Dost thou not fear the chilling blight That oft has been affection's meed?â Sure none need fear for earthly ill, To whom thy heart and hand are given, And for protection higher still, I look with humble trust, to Heaven. Thy soul exceeds thy form, he criedâ Oh nobly would'st thou fill a throne, The proudest nation might with pride Behold its diadem thine own.â Then gaily to the festal hall Again Don Manuel led the way, Where in the wassail, and the ball The joyous evening pass'd away. Don Leon and his lovely bride Fill'd every eye and heart that night, While Anna's father gaz'd with pride, And wept with an old man's delight. And Leon from that blessed day Became a good and loyal knight, Forsaking every evil way, And making virtue his delight. Meantime along a terrace walk, With fragrant plants, and vines array'd, Engross'd in soul-absorbing talk Josepha and her champion stray'd. Her jewel'd robes had given place To unadorn'd and simple dress, And beautiful in form and face, She stood in her own loveliness. His cumbrous mail was thrown aside, His limbs were free, his head was bare; Josepha mark'd with glance of pride His bright blue eyes, and sunny hair. He spoke of loveâand all her soul Assented with a sweet accord; While new-born passion's sweet control Subdued her heart to own its lord. And while her timid bosom prov'd A first true love triumphing there, She felt how Anna's heart had lov'd, And learn'd to pity her despair. The morning, with its eye of light, Beheld her at the altar stand, To give a poor and nameless knight, With woman's trust, her heart and hand. But when the holy rite was o'er, A stranger train, in rich array, Appearing at the chapel door, Toward the altar made its way. Hail! Prince of Portugal, they cried, Joy to your highness most serene! And blessings on your peerless bride; Long may she live, our worshipp'd Queen! And while they bent the obsequious knee, Josepha stood like one amaz'd; Is this reality? said she, Or am I in a dream? or craz'd?â 'Tis sober truthâthe bridegroom said, For Prince of Portugal I am; Now greet thy guests, my royal bride, To grace our nuptial day they came. In my far home I heard thy fame, For every lovely female grace, And here in humble guise I came, To hear thy voice, and see thy face. And lo! not half thine excellence Had been reported to mine ear,â And I despatch'd a message hence, To bid these nobles meet me here. Then rang the shout through Manuel's hall 'Till his dark turrets reel'd with glee, While voice, and harp, and organ, all Peal'd forth the bridal melody.â And she was worthy of a king, Who, with a pious pitying breast, Had once resign'd her bridal ring, To make a rival maiden blest. MEETING OF THE YEARS. I saw them meet the Old Year, and the New, In Ã¦rial pomp, beside my wild wood home. Night lay upon the forest, cold and still, Like hope upon my pathway; and the moon Pour'd from her silver bows, a flood of light Upon earth's ermine robe of drifted snow, O'er which innumerable diamonds flash'd Dazzling my weary eyes with piercing gleams, Quivering and shifting, even amid the gloom Of the dark foliage of the noble pines, That border the clear hill-side. Lo! a sound Of airy pinions passing to and fro, Amongst the swaying branches, while the trees Majestically bow'd their plumy heads Unto the airy ministers of heaven, Which blend their voices in mysterious hymn Of liquid melody, which fills the night With wordless worship to the living God. A worship more appropriate and pure, Than all the studied harmony of words That man has mind to frame, or voice to chant.â Like ice drops flashing in the morning beams, A group of glorious creatures swept along. First one of lofty and majestic mien, And strange and dreamy beauty, which the eye Could dwell upon for ever, and not tire. Her foot upon the snow-drift left no print, And waked no echo. Silently, and swift She mov'd like some bright dream, all unadorn'd Save her own heavenly beauty. In one hand She held the seal of Fate, and key to heaven; The other grasp'd a sceptre of strange power, Which changes with a touch all things on earth, And writes on all life's treasuresâVanity! I knew the silent angel, she is Time, The eldest daughter of Eternity. Immortal youth, and chastity are hers; Though all mankind with ardent sighs and tears Pour out their prayers before her, every one Beseeching her to stay, and be his own, She passes on unheeding. At her side With measur'd solemn pace, and weary air A fair etherial creature held her way. Her feet were stain'd with blood, her locks were dark, And thickly gemm'd with tears, and deep sad sighs Were breathing round, her like the atmosphere Which noxious nightshade gathers round her bower.â Her ample robe, which had been purely white Was written o'er with myriad tales, of sin, Of dark deceit, of sufferings, and of wo; While shining here and there, like radiant gems Amid the dross, and darkness of the mine, Good deeds, and generous acts were chronicled. And penitential tears were sprinkled o'er, In beautiful relief to those dark lines Which told of shame, and wrong. She bore a vase Fill'd with sweet faded flowers, which she had torn From many a bleeding stem. Hark! a deep peal Burst on the dreaming midnight, and a sigh Heav'd the dark bosom of the solemn wood, And died away. Then came a rushing sound,â And a young regal spirit was display'd In robes of glistening white. A radiant smile Play'd o'er her features, like a morning beam Upon the face of May. Her right hand bore A dewy cluster of the richest balm That ever grew in Eden.âBut a sword Keen as the quivering lightning grac'd her left: Sister! she cried, as the Old Year advanc'd, God calls thee to thy rest. I come to bring Healing unto the wounds that thou hast made, And to inflict others, as dread and deep. They join'd their hands a moment, while the winds Paus'd on their moonlight pinions, and it seem'd That nature held her breath. The twelfth deep chime Of midnight sounded, and the clasping hands Were sever'd, and for ever. Then young Hope Came with her magic smile, and golden curls, Gem'd with sweet dewy buds, from wild rose-trees; Her silver lute was perfectly in tune, And warbled symphony to all her songs Of soul-enthralling promise. Gracefully She led the welcome New Year. But I saw Time walking on beside them, unperceiv'd By those who revel in their joyousness. The Old Year dropp'd the pale flowers from her vase, And drew her robe of record round her form, And the pavilion of Eternity Enclos'd her in its drapery of mist, And she was gone, for ever.â Then remained Of all the pageant of that midnight chime One pensive angel, with bright fragrant tears Upon her smiling beauty. Carefully She gather'd from the snow those faded flowers, Wreath'd them in garlands, for her breast and brow, And sung such sweet sad legends of their bloom; While with her words their incense breath'd its wealth, That from my heart the pent up waters gush'd, And flow'd in soothing over all the wound That ached within my bosom. Memory! How kind thou art; thus to preserve the flowers Which years break from the branches of our joy, And scatter on the frozen drift, to die;â And then to sooth the spirit with thy hymn When hope forsakes us, for the glad young hearts That hail the happy New Year, and we sit Alone with thee. CHANGES. 'Twas June, the loveliest priestess of the twelve, That wait in Earth's great temple, each in turn Offering the gifts of Nature to her God, Each beautiful,âand most appropriate The offerings she presents. But June, sweet June, Comes with the warmest holiest glow of love, The most exquisite incense, and a hymn Of all sweet voices blended, gushing up From human heart, from harps with flashing wings, From grove, and woodland, where the breezes wake A low sweet chorus from the swaying wreaths Of tremulous green bells; from every shore That running water kisses, blending all With deep wild song of winds, and deep dread voice Of Ocean's adoration; while the heavens Seem bending o'er the altar with a smile So calm, so sweet, so graciously benign, That the instinctive spirit of all life Thrills with ecstatic worship. On the shore That border'd with bright emerald a broad stream, The pride and blessing of a lovely land, My own dear native landâOh, how mine eyes Grow dim and painful as I muse on thee, My blessed native land! Aye, on the shore Of that rich river, stood a fair young girl Alone; for she had left the playful band Of laughing sisters, and stood silent there. Her living picture now is on my heart. Daguerreotyp'd by that strong spirit-light Which writes on memory. She was a mere child Of scarce five summers, and her little feet Were bare and pearl-like, 'mid the dripping flowers. (She was a poor man's child,) her golden curls Lay in profusion on her broad high brow, And shoulders white as lilies. But her eyes, Her large blue tender eyes, were deeply fring'd With long dark lashes, as if nature sought To hide the loving spirits bathing there, From sacrilegious gaze. They were such eyes As ne'er should look on misery, or sin; They were so pure, so gentle, and so true, So faithful to the soul, and pleaded so To all they met for tender sympathy. Such eyes should never read the cold false world. The dear domestic bower of holy love Built in a shelter'd vale, where all sweet things Are of spontaneous growth, should be the home In which they should diffuse their tenderness And gather in the deep abiding love, Which is their light and life. A summer cloud Had thrown its wealth of rain-drops liberally Upon the fainting earth, and passing o'er It now was hovering with its dusky wing Outspread beyond the river, while the bow Hung glorious on its pathway,âand the child Was gazing on that seal which God has set To his eternal promise. All her soul Was trembling in the light of those blue eyes, Like pure reflection of the starry heavens On deep, still water. It was easy then To read her destinyâthat she was form'd Of high and pure susceptibilities, Shrined in a heart whose strings were all attuned Unto the music of adoring love, To God, and nature. Easy 'twere to tell How such a heart would give to human love Its perfect and adoring worshipping; That it would cast itself upon that love In fervent trust, and self-forgetfulness; Like some fair launch committed to the waves To be their own for ever, though their calm Shall change to tempest, still to be their own, In wreck, in ruin, evermore their own. A creature made and fashion'd but to lie Upon their bosom, and obey their will. But she knew naught of this, for in that hour She felt the first strange yearnings of a Soul Toward the Great, the Beautiful, and Good; And learn'd her kindred to all fair, and sweet, And holy things. There came a change. She was no more a child, Although not yet upon her radiant brow Was laid the shadow of the full-blown wreath Of early womanhood. She had grown tall And full of queenly graces. Those bright curls Had chang'd to auburn ringlets, and her cheeks Flush'd with each throb of the young timid heart, Just trembling with a new-born consciousness Of its delicious life. She stood that night Amid the dancers, and her tiny feet Bore her along as if she were the soul Of all the melody that sported there. Admiring glances follow'd all her steps, And many a voice proclaim'd that she was fair, Aye, fairest of the fair; and envy heard, But dared not touch the childish purity Of one so young and guileless. But the maidâ She smiled and blush'd, and turn'd her from a scene In which she felt no sympathy, and sought The holy moonlight's cool and silent flood, The element of all fantastic forms Of active fancy, where they sport themselves, And hold mysterious rites, and weave strange wreaths To lay upon the sleeper's brow and breast Strange wreaths of joy and sorrow, light and shade, Which men call dreams, composed of shadowy buds And blossoms, cull'd from some light cloud that floats An island in that ocean, wandering still Between the earth and heaven, allied to both, And intimate with neither. Sometimes, too, The mystic creatures snatch a mournful wreath From ridges of the black-brow'd thunder-storm, Where sits the thunder with his living darts Of fiery serpents. These are fearful dreams By cruel fancies braided, and we start Affrighted at their touch. But they all fade, And melt to moonshine, at the touch of truth. Thus mus'd the maiden, with her pleading eyes Uprais'd toward their kindred starry blue; And moonlight fancies trac'd a glowing scene Of such delights as they, and they alone, Can shadow forth, and in that world of bliss One perfect being reign'd, who courted her With loving words, to come and share with him That blessed paradise. The maiden sigh'd, That voice was all familiar to her ear, And whisper'd now, that she was gazing on The vision'd land of Love. Oh! she forgot That this fair picture was of moonlight too! The scene was chang'd. It was a wilderness, A wild dark forest of old patriarch trees, Gigantic trees, of which no living man Could say, I saw them when their trunks were less, Their heads less high than now. Moss-grown, and gray They stood, the monuments of ages past; Engrav'd in characters which every eye May read and understand, with one great name, The name of Him who rear'd them; of all else As desert ruins silent, save at times When spirits from the far mysterious past Come back like children to a household hearth, And mourn for all the beautiful and dear That come no more to meet them. Then a voice Of strange dark sighing heaves the heavy robes Above their stern old hearts. The land was rough With abrupt rocky hills and broken dells, Where warrior laurel grew, for ever green, And fair witch-hazles wove their golden blooms In wreaths for stern December, forming bowers, Fit palaces for all such things as joy In solitude and darkness, for the sun Scarce sent one glittering arrow, all day long, To fright them from their revels. Rapid streams Fill'd those wild dells with music, as they dash'd Along their rocky channels. In these glens The hypocritic panther made his lair With mosses for his pillow, and fair shrubs, In dewy garlands, drooping o'er his form, While, with his half-closed eyes, and quiet foot, That sheath'd its terrors, all day long he lay And waited, listening for the cautious tread, Of doe, or spotted fawn. And gangs of wolves Crouch'd in those twilight thickets, kept in bands By horrible community of taste For blood and rapine. 'Twas a rough wild land; Even beauty wore a savage aspect there, And peace was like a silence, caus'd by fear. And she was there, who in her childhood play'd Beside the river, where the city's spires Threw shadows on the water. She, whose foot Was lightest in the dance, whose voice in song Enchain'd all list'ners with its melody; She, who had been admir'd where all were fair, And lov'd where all were lovely. She was thereâ Loneâloneâand broken-hearted. Dost thou know How fares the forest dweller, in her hut Of unhewn logs, erected hastily, With windows all unglaz'd, and roof of bark, Through which the rain-drops trickle, and the stars Look down upon the sleeper? Hast thou known The stern privation, and the cruel want That make themselves at home in such abodes, And cast their shadows between heart and heart, Excluding love's warm sunlight, till the blooms That look to it for life, grow pale and die? If thou dost know these things, I need not tell The painful story. If thou knowest not, 'Twere vain to tell, for thou canst not believe.â She was still young, and on her face and form, The magic light of beauty linger'd still; The rose was on her cheek; but o'er her brow There lay a shadow, even when she smiled, The fearful shadow which a darkened heart Throws on the sunshine of the spirit's joy. And those blue eyesâthe dewy tenderness Of heaven dwelt still within them, and bright forms Of human sympathies lay tremblingly Amid their troubled waters,âand her voice Had in its cadence that complaining tone, With which the heart, that will not be belied, Tells its own story. She had learn'd perforce, Oh! many a bitter lesson, and had grown Familiar with cold looks and cruel words, And want, and toil, and weeping. All alone She bore her burden, for there came to her No glance or word, of that sweet sympathy That lies with gentle soothing like rich balm Upon the wounded spirit. Desolate Were all life's ways to her. Yet oftentimes At summer evening when the thunder's voice Grew low from distance, and the storm-cloud seem'd A gorgeous portrait, with its lofty towers Of marble and bright metalsâwhen the bow Shone, like the jewell'd gate-way of high heaven, Till fancy almost deem'd that glorious world Half-visible amid the soft gray mist That veil'd the open entrance. Or at night When moonlight with its gentle influence Hush'd bird and flower to sleepâsweet memories came Like song-birds of familiar melody From lands where all was bright, and full of bliss, And innocence, and beautyâbut from which She was an exile, never to return! Oh! never to return. Yet still they came To that dark shore, on which her lot was cast, With flashing wings, to sing one well-known song And then return, across the wide dim sea, Which murmurs Farewell! Farewell! evermore. Oh, sweet and blessed memories of young life, With plumage of the brightest hues of hope, And songs of love's ecstatic melody, Why come ye to the dark and weary heart? Or coming, wherefore flit so soon away?â 'Twas May, and yet the frost lay cold and white On bud, and leaf, and blossoms, like the shroud O'er rigid forms of death. Oh, sorrowful It was to see all sweet and beauteous things Thus blighted in the blooming, by the wing Of the destroying angel. She that morn Stood in her garden. She had planted there A favourite shrub, brought from her native land, And nurs'd and watch'd it long, and tenderly. And it had grown, and budded rich and fair, With promise of abundant blossoming, To compensate the hopes, and cares of years. Now as she look'd upon it through her tears, She thought, how like is this poor ruin'd tree Nipp'd in its budding, to the blighted heart; And then she mus'd in numbers, of the buds That perish e'er the bloomingâ My beautiful buds, fondly cherish'd, Bright gems on the bosom of May, By untimely frost ye are perish'd, And soon will be wither'd awayâ My beautiful buds! Oh, beautiful buds! ye were fairer Than infancy's innocent face, And to my lone heart ye were dearer Than aught in this desolate place My beautiful buds! The hopes of my childhood are broken; The star of my girlhood is set, But ye were a heart-cherish'd token, From one who can never forgetâ My beautiful buds! I weep, for ye sadly remind me Of buds from the garden of love, Which Hope in her joyousness twin'd me, With amaranth richly inwove, My beautiful buds! My spirit did homage before them As on my heart's altar they lay, But sorrow's cold blighting came o'er them, Ah me! They have wither'd away, My beautiful buds! Full many a promise of pleasure Has found in my bosom a tomb, Like ye my ephemeral treasure, The wreaths were forbidden to bloom, My beautiful buds! Oh, desolate-hearted and weary, I weep in life's garden alone; My spirit is stricken, and dreary, Alas! for my hopes, all undone.â My beautiful buds! Yet there is a garland, that never Shall feel the cold mildew of deathâ Oh might I entwine ye forever In poesy's evergreen wreath, My beautiful buds! The while she sang This simple lay, she felt within her breast The first deep yearnings of a spirit touch'd With that strange fire which burns within the soul And wakes a thirst for fame. Another change.âIt was a winter eve, The fire was blazing brightly on the hearth Within a rural dwelling. She was there, But oh, no longer young or beautiful; For toil, and sorrow, and the restlessness With which strong spirits struggle with their bonds, Like those wild mighty birds that will not brook The chains they cannot sever; these had touch'd The grace and beauty of her form, and face; But in her eyes the spirit liv'd and spake, And dazzled as of old. Around her sat A band of children, and with gentle voice She gave familiar lessons, teaching them The gentle virtues, knitting their young hearts In one sweet bond of love; and leading thus Their willing minds by easy flowery paths Toward the hill of science. Still she plied Her needle all the while, with busy hand, And oftentimes, amid her cheerful words, Sigh'd all unconsciouslyâthen smiled again, And spoke to them of hope, and coming years, Bright with the beams that always shine from heaven Upon the path of piety, and truth. Her task was done. The evening prayers were said, The good night spoken, and the kiss exchang'd, And she was left alone. She brought her pen And spread before her the unsullied sheet, On which she thought to trace the imagings Of bright and sportive fancies. But her hand Was cold and weary, and her heart was sad. Beside her lay a page on which her name Was printed with high honours as a bard Well worthy of a place amid the band, Of which her country boasts. So she had won The meed she coveted, the wreath of Fame, And now she felt the utter worthlessness, Of such a glittering toy. It had no power To still the painful throbbings of her heart, To cool the fever of her troubled brain, Or satisfy the yearnings of her soul.â She droop'd her face upon her folded hands And wept, oh, long and bitterly. At length With trembling hand, oft rais'd to brush away The tears, that in her eyelids gather'd still, And hung upon their fringes like the drops, That gem the foliage when the shower is past, She wrote,â A WOMAN'S MONODY TO FAME. What has my heart to do with theeâOh, Fame, Imperial goddess of a world of dreams? Why should a woman wish to see her name Emblazon'd by thy dazzling glory-beams? Why should a timid woman wish to stand, Upon thy rainbow arch, which spans the world! While ardent worshippers, of every land, Peruse her banner to the winds unfurl'd. Ah, wherefore should a woman seek to bind Thy gorgeous laurel o'er her timid brow? Or claim that proud supremacy of mind, To which thou bidd'st the crown'd and sceptred bow? Thy realm is of the mind, magnificent, And full of light and beauty; flashing forth Wild wreath of fitful glory, richly blent, But cold, as the aurora of the North. And like that mystic pageantry, a wreath Of phantom flames, that float upon the air, High o'er this world's dim atmosphere of death, Yet not of heaven. They claim no kindred there. What has a woman then to do with thee, And thine unreal joys? How can she live On things untangible, or find delight, In aught thine aerial pageantry can give? A woman's nature is all tenderness, To human love her heart is wholly given; Her spirit twines all holy sympathies, And bears them with a holier love to heaven. The gushing melodies of woman's lyre Should be all gentleness, and like the dove's, Sung in her own dear home, with no desire To charm, beyond her own domestic loves.â Fame's clarion has no music for the ear, That lists to love's entrancing melodies; And she who hears fond language all sincere, Will never prize the world's false flatteries. She cannot thirst, for whom affection's spring Is ever flowing, in her fragrant bowers; A laurel chaplet is a worthless thing, To her who wears religion's balmy flowers. It is the high proud heart, the restless heart, Which has no sanctuary, nor place of rest; Which lives from hope and happiness apart, Within a cold and memory-haunted breast. Which will not feed on base and earth-born joys; Which cannot fill itself with shining gold; Which looks with scorn on fashion's gilded toys, And yearns some real treasure to enfold. Which madly asks the living wreath of fame To bind a brow, which throbs with grief, and pain, Which deems the echo of an honour'd name, Would wake a wither'd heart to bliss again. But these things cannot be. Fame is to her A mirage of the desert, falsely fair, Which lures with hope the fainting traveller, To perish with a more intense despair. She strings her harp, and throws upon the breeze, The fitful numbers that betray her wo, Wild words, and sweetly mournful melodies That thrill and pain the spirit, as they flow. The cag'd bird sings an artificial lay To please its feeder,âbut the wild notes free, That wooed its mate, in bright groves far away, Were sweeterâso with woman's minstrelsy. TO THE NORTHERN LIGHT. Bright mystery of Heaven! with raptur'd awe I gaze upon thy dreadful loveliness, And wonder what thou art, and whence thou art, And wherefore thou art here. Thy glorious folds Of changeable and undulating light Seem fasten'd at the zenith, streaming thence In variegated hues of white, and rose, And flamy orange, mingling with deep shades Of crimson, and the dash of pitchy smoke, In rich festoons diverging to the earth And curtaining heaven's vault, east, north, and west, Leaving the southern stars alone unveil'd, Except where here and there, a single one Is beaming forth, as if between the folds Of those mysterious curtains, keeping guard; Or smiling in the many eyes uprais'd In wonder, awe, and terror. I would fain Invade your mysteries, for I do not heed The words of those who deem ye forerunners Of fearful things to come;âof battleâfloodâ Or fireâor winding sheet. Nor heed I yet The grave conceits of speculative minds, Which deem ye meteoric phantasies; Or wandering flames of electricity; Or that ye are as Symms' theory Endeavour'd to persuade us, only rays Of the far southern sun, reflecting through The strange internal regions of the earth, Upon the frozen northern atmosphere. I do not like such prosing theories, For I believe that ye're the lambent flames That poets' souls are made of. There's a hue For every grade of genius, and a shade For every tuneful fancy. And ye seem So undefinableâso beautifulâ So strangeâso grandâso fearfulâas ye move Between the earth and heaven; mysterious lightsâ Which earth-born creatures cannot comprehend. Perchance the Ã¦riel powers Are holding some grand festival to-night, With mystic rites, which mortals may not see; And they have curtain'd their high galleries With this yet unembodied intellect, Fearfully wrought, and gloriously festoon'd Before the lighted concave. Lo, I see Though dimly, through the half transparent veil Bright moving forms parading to and fro, In august ceremonies. It may be The bridal of some bright and loving star, Or possibly the spirits of the air Are holding a masonic lodge to-night. And though these flames possess not yet the forms Of active intellectâstill I believe That the impressions of these mystic scenes Remain for ever with them; flitting oft With undefin'd and thrilling imagery Along the darken'd mirror of the mind Within its clay-built temple; filling it With bright unearthly hopes, and visions bless'd Of love, and joy, and beauty. Gushing oft In high and wondrous harpings, fitful lays, And wild and strange conceits, which other minds Approach not in their dreaming. Whence the thrill, The indescribable, electric thrill, That rushes through the spirit, as some tone Of nature's melody awakes the ear; Or when some balmy zephyr bathes the brow; Or as the wandering eye marks some rich tint In summer's rosy garland; when the wind Bends the elastic grain, and blossom'd stem; Or when the rich old forest gently waves His dark green plumes, answering in majesty To its impassion'd whisper? When the clouds Heave up in glorious forms, and dazzling hues: Or lie like sleeping beauty, softly bright; Or sometimes when the trembling star of eve Looks lovingly upon us? Is it not That these things touch some half unconscious chord That vibrates with the memories of the past, E'er earth enshrin'd the spirit? It must be That in the secret treasury of the mind, There lies a blazon'd volume of the scenes, The trancing beauty and rich hymns of heaven; With which the spirit was familiar once, And which it longs for ever, wandering on Amid the mazes of earth, sense and sin; Catching at every shadow, which appears, In fancy's magic mirror, like the form Of some bright bliss, which memory's piercing eye Sees in that hidden volume; wailing still In bitter disappointment, as it grasps The vain and empty shade, or sees it flit In smiling scorn away. Just as your wreaths, Of bright aurorean tints, ye Northern Lights, Are fading from the Borealean gates Of Heaven's immense cathedral. THE SWEET SOUTH WIND. Hark, 'tis the sweet South Wind! How soft its dewy fingers touch the keys, Which thrill such melting music through the mind, Even the green leaves of the forest trees. There is a witchery In the soft music, like the voice of love: Now gushing o'er the soul deliciously, Then sighing tenderly along the grove. It seemeth to mine ear The rustling of some holy creature's wing, Sent from some passionless and sinless sphere, Unction of peace unto the soul to bring. My temples feel its power. Cooling and soothing every throbbing vein, My spirit lifts its weary wings once more, And bursts the strong clasp of care's sordid chain: And floats all calm and free, Blent with the music of the bending wood; Fill'd with the light of immortality, Even the presence of the living God. Nature is full of Him, And every willing spirit feels his power; Even as the south wind fills the forest dim, And bends with its rich weight each lowly flower. Oh! may death come to me, On the soft breath of such a night as this; To lift the thin veil of mortality, And let me bathe, at once, in perfect bliss. THE LAST PALE FLOWERS. The last pale flowers are drooping on the stems, The last searleaves are fluttering on the trees, The latest groups of summer's flying gems, Are warbling forth their parting melodies. The winds seem heavy-wing'd, and linger by, Whispering to every pale and sighing leaf; And sun-light falls all dim and tremblingly, Like love's fond farewell through the mist of grief. There is a dreamy presence every where, As if of spirits passing to and fro; We almost hear their voices in the air, And feel their balmy pinions touch the brow. We feel as if a breath might put aside The shadowy curtain of the spirit-land; Revealing all the lov'd and glorified, That death has taken from affection's band. We call their names, and listen, for the sound Of their familiar low-voic'd melodies; We look almost expectantly around For their dear faces, with the loving eyes. We feel them near us, and spread out the scroll Of hearts, whose feelings they were wont to share, That they may read the constancy of soul, And all the high, pure motives written there. And then we weep, as if our cheek were prest To holy Friendship's unsuspecting heart, Which understands our own. Oh, vision blest! Alas! that such illusion should depart. I oft have pray'd that death may come to me In such a spiritual autumnal day; Heaven seems so nearâI tremble to be free, And pass, with all the beautiful, away. SUNRISE IN THE FOREST. Look out upon the draperies of the East, Those glorious folds of crimson, and bright blue, And splendid purple, edg'd and fring'd with gold, Or border'd with bright silver. Seem they not Like curtains at the window of high heaven, Whose texture barely screens the glorious place, From sacrilegious gaze; permitting floods Of radiant light and beauty to stream forth Upon the Great One's gardenâthis fair earth. Lo! now, a minister of the Most High, The dazzling sun, looks forth with joyous smile, His eye is heavenward, with an ardent glow Of adoration, while his loving smile Gladdens this earth, which watches for its light With all her myriad eyes. Now gushes forth From all the pure, and bright, and innocent, A hymn of adoration unto Him Who dwells within the veil. At first, the birds Awake in bush, and bower, and shady tree. Shake their bright wings, erect their shining heads, And pour in concert such enchanting songs. Of mingled tones, and melting melodies, All blending in one full rich swell of praise: Ten thousand voices, from the hills and plains Join in a low deep chorus. The clear springs Reflect the sun-smiles back to heaven again, And pour a song of waters, which flows on With never-ceasing music through all lands, And joins the chorus of the shouting sea. Each little dew-ey'd flower looks smiling up, And bows in child-like worship. The green trees, With voices in each leaf, bend and adore, As the free winds pass by, wafting along Incense from all the sweet, music from all The innocent and joyful, and with wings Of life and beauty, bearing them to Heaven A holy and accepted offering. SUNSET IN THE FOREST. Come now unto the Forest, and enjoy The loveliness of nature. Look abroad And note the tender beauty, and repose Of the magnificent, in earth and sky. See what a radiant smile of golden light O'erspreads the face of heaven; while the west Burns like a living ruby, in the ring Of the deep green horizon. Now the shades Are deepening round the feet of the tall trees, Bending the head of the pale blossoms down Upon their mother's bosom, where the breeze Comes with a low sweet hymn and balmy kiss, To lull them to repose. Look now, and see How every mountain, with its leafy plume, Or rocky helm, with crest of giant pine, Is veil'd with floating amber, and gives back The loving smile of the departing sun, And nods a calm adieu. Hark! from the dell Where sombre hemlocks sigh unto the streams, Which with its everlasting harmony Returns each tender whisper; what a gush Of liquid melody, like soft, rich tones Of flute and viol, mingling in sweet strains Of love and rapture, float away tow'rd heaven. 'Tis the Ãdolco from her sweet place, Singing to nature's God the perfect hymn Of nature's innocence. Does it not seem That earth is list'ning to that evening song? There's such a hush on mountain, plain, and streams. Seems not the sun to linger in his bower On yonder leafy summit, pouring forth His glowing adoration unto God, Blent with that evening hymn? while every flower Bows gracefully, and mingles with the strain Its balmy breathing. Have you look'd on aught In all the panoply, and bustling pride Of the dense city with its worldly throng, So soothing, so delicious to the soul, So like the ante-chamber of high heaven, As this old forest, with the emerald crown Which it has worn for ages, glittering With the bright halo of departing day? While from its bosom living seraphim, Are hymning gratitude and love to God. MY HEART IS LIKEâ My heart is like an ocean shell Thrown high upon a desert shore; Far from the mermaid's magic cell In which it dwelt of yore. Far from the rich and holy bowers Where corals arch the marble floor, And sea-weeds with their cold fresh flowers Are richly wreathen o'er. Far from the reef where amber lies And brilliant ocean feathers grow; While pearly shells of various dyes Adorn the depths below. From where the fountains of the deep Are gushing in their sounding halls; Where God's eternal mysteries sleep, And sun-light never falls. From purest alabaster caves Where the dense flood lies still and bright, While far above, the shouting waves Sport with the tempest's might. From the strong cabinets which hold The priceless treasures of the sea, Rich gems, and veins of virgin gold, Of unknown brilliancy. Far from the sunny isles of shells, Where bright waves kiss a silver strand, Where soft wings wave, and music swells The pomp of fairy land. From these remov'd the lonely shell Lies glittering on the arid ground; Above its bed no billows swell, No kindred sleep around; Yet ever from its deep recess There breathes a low, a hymning tone, Like mellow music of the sea On evening breezes thrown. My heart is like an ocean shell, From young life's fairy regions thrown, Upon a barren land to dwell, Scath'd, thirsty, and alone. While memory from its deep recess Breathes forth an everlasting strain, Of days, and scenes of blessedness That cannot come again. My heart is like an ocean shell Thrown high upon a desert shore, And murmuring from its lonely cell Fond memoriesâever more!â YES, I HAVE WANDERED. Yes, I have wander'd long, Dear native-land from thee; But still within my heart is shrin'd Thy blessed memory. Thy blessed memory! Oh, bright its angels come, Each with its dear familiar face And loving words of Home. Oh, who that on New England's breast Her tiny infant foot-print prest, However far her feet may stray, Has ever borne her heart away. Oh, I have wander'd long, In weariness of soul, Where cities glitter in their pride, And noble rivers roll; Where noble rivers roll Through valleys bright and warm, And crested mountains proudly frown Each o'er its mirror'd form. But who, that braided childhood's dreams, Beside New England's tuneful streams, Where broader, deeper waters glide, Can love the scenery, or the tide. Oh, I have wander'd wide, By many a far-famed spot, Yet dear New England's hills and vales, Have never been forgot; Oh, never once forgot My native city fair, The blessed home of infancy, The hallow'd house of prayer. Who that in girlhood's summer hours Was wreath'd amongst New England's flowers, However far her steps may rove, Can e'er forget her home of love. Oh, many a year I've dwelt, Within this shadowy dell, And oft have hush'd my heart, to list The wild harp's fitful swell; The wild harp's fitful swell, Has sooth'd my saddest hour, But still the richest melodies Breath'd from my native bower. Oh, who that learn'd the Muses' lore In childhood, on New England's shore, Can ever cease to love the strain, That bears her spirit home again. TO THE DEAD. Oh, come, one moment, from the spirit-land My injur'd love. This poor heart cries to thee For ever, day and night.âOh come, dear love, And listen to my agonizing plea. I neither knew thy heart, or mine, fond love, When I addres'd to thee those proud cold words, Those bitter cruel words,âOh that sweet breath, Should wound more keenly, than the sharpest swords. I did not knowâindeed I knew not then, That they were false, and cruel, and would be Death to thy generous bosom, and keen pangs Of living, writhing agony to me. Oh! I would give a thousand years of life With all earth's wealth, and honor, thrones, and powers, If all were mine, to purchase from the Past, The irrevocable Pastâone little hour. That hour in which I threw thee from my heart, With cold, proud tauntingâOh! great God! forgive! Vain prayer.âThere is no word of peace for me, Since there's no word to bid my victim live. Dear love, Oh, come to me one little hour, And let me kneel before thee, at thy feet, And there unsay those bitter heartless words, And pray thee to forgive them, and forget. Oh, come to me, one hour! and let me gaze Into the loving soul of thy blue eye,â I know thy generous spirit would forgive, If thou could'st gaze upon mine agony. I know thou would'st forgive me, though I turn'd Cold-hearted, and indignant from thy plea; Thou would'st forgive, if I could tell thee all,â And how I lov'd thee, while I murder'd thee. Yes, I did murder thee! I gave thy years Of hope and usefulness to the cold tomb; But did I kill thy soul?âThat thoughtâOh, God! It gnaws my spirit, from the place of gloom. Oh, did'st thou worship me? and did I stand Between thee, and the Merciful? If so There is for me no hopeâI yield my soul To endless tortures of despairing wo. Yet comeâthough I may never be forgiven, Come but one moment. It would ease my breast To know that though I reft thee of thy life, Thou dwellest in the Paradise of rest. I plead in vain.âThou wilt not, can'st not come From that dim far-off land of mysteryâ Oh, then I pray theeâlet me hear thy voice, Ah me!âThere comes no voice, but memory. And she repeats thy tender pleading words, And shows the wealth of friendship, truth, and love, That thou did'st lavish on me. She repeats The words that broke thy hopes, the hopes I wove. The words that were thy death-doomâOh, I weep, But tears are no relief to this swoll'n heart; Each drop but seems to burn into my soul, And bid a thousand drops more bitter start. Thy latest thought of me was bath'd in tears, In unavailing tears,âyet O! believe, If I had been beside thee, in that hour My love, my grief, had won thee to forgive. I would have laid my naked heart on thine, And thus have sooth'd and saved thee.âOh, vain thought! That would propitiate thus the spectral pastâ Thy heart lies crush'd within the shroud I wrought. Yet penitence goes up with anguish'd prayer, And pleads for mercy, at the throne of heavenâ Oh, let her bring some token, some sweet pledge That thou art blest, dear love, and I forgiven. OCEAN MELODIES. Ocean's eternal song! With what a deep and soothing melody That ever changeful voice of solemn tone Comes on the listening ear. In Fancy's dreams When my young spirit own'd her regal sway, Before Experience with her diamond pen Had written Falsehood! on her magic glass, Thus marring the rich landscapes, and bright heavens, Which it doth shadow forth;âwhen life was fair, And earth a paradise, and innocence Inscrib'd on all around me; when all sounds Became articulate of legends strange Of wealth, or love, or beauty,âThen I deem'd That there were voices blended in the swell Of Ocean's glorious lay, to which the waves Beat time upon the strand, and when the breeze Slept on his bosom, breathing now and then A balmy sigh, as if it dream'd of love. Or when the mighty windsâthe stormy winds Dipp'd their strong pinions in the flashing flood And shouted, and rush'd onward, fitfully Careering in their madness; lifting up The waters on their plumes, and marching through Between the rolling heaps; then with a shriek Striking the shuddering summits with their wings, Till they were white with foam, then bound away Chanting with wildly measur'd chorus still Their hymn of majesty. Oh, I have felt My inmost spirit tremble as the voice Of many waters wrestling with the winds, Came up from the dark sea with many a lay Of those who slumber in the far deep caves, Where mysteries dwell, which eye of living man Has never search'd, and never can explore. 'Tis agony to think how many hearts, Torn from the golden chain that clasps around The dear domestic altar, are cast forth Upon the desert, where the Ocean flood Tramps over them for ever.â Earth to earth Is Nature's burial law; but the deep sea, The living shudder, as they contemplate Its dread immensity, and fear to sleep In its mysterious bosom. But the dead! They go down calmly to the mermaid bowers Of beautiful cold sea-weed; to the caves Where lie the pearl shells; to the coral banks Where bright finn'd tribes are sporting; to the fields Of rank, brown grasses, where Leviathan Gambols, and feeds at pleasure. There's no fear In those still bosoms, when the monstrous forms Of that dim world float past them. Not a thrill Vibrates along the nerves, as o'er the cheek The cold sea serpent trails his slimy form. No eager avarice tempts the hand to clutch The masses of pure silver, or bright gold That pave the unspotted marble palaces; Nor ever brightens up the leaden eye Beneath the glorious diamond-studded arch; Nor in the halls where sparkle every ray Of every flashing gem, or colour'd stone; Or where the precious shells and amber lie, Like sand-stones on a desert valueless; They feel no joy amid the treasuries Of their eternal mansions; not a swell Of pride inflates the breast, or lifts the face In scorn of earth, and yet not unto heaven: No awe binds down the brow in reverence Of him who builded these stupendous domes, And garnish'd them in glory. Those that find Their resting places in the dungeon cells, At the foundations of the eternal walls That base the mighty mountains, shudder not, Nor weep, nor clasp their hands in wild despair, That Ocean with its everlasting bars Encloses them for ever; shutting out Warmth, light, and human voice. They never call On those who walk the sunny green-rob'd earth, Those ocean dwellersâThey have no regrets For the society of friend, or love, Or child, or parent. Every heart is still, And every feature calm and passionless. Their voices never mingle in the wail That lives along the waters. I have deem'd That the wild agony of the bereav'd, Pour'd forth in broken words, and shrieks, and moans With bitter sobbings mingled, and strange prayers, Is living ever, o'er the liquid tomb, A ceaseless dirge for those that sleep below. Thus as I mus'd beneath the willow boughs Marking how slow and gracefully they waved Their assent, to the wooing of the winds,â The Ocean Melody came on mine ear Burden'd with this sad ditty. Canst thou not hear my voice, dear Amadon, Down in the cold deep sea? Will no kind spirit tell how I mourn, How bitterly I weepâ For thee? O that thy Lora slumbered with thee, love, Even on thine icy breast; 'Twere better far, than thus like some lone dove To roam, and seek in vain For rest. Oh! wherefore were we parted? We who lov'd With so intense a flame, That every pulse in either bosom mov'd With joy and tenderness, The same. Even in our childhood, when with fairy feet We danc'd amongst the flowers, It was companionship that made so sweet, The rosy garland of Young hours. And when our bosoms learn'd to know the swell Of love's delicious tide, 'Twas bliss in fancy's magic world to dwell Long pleasant years with thee, Thy bride. And when we were divided, all my heart Went sorrowing forth with thee; And absenceâOh! what language can impart How its long hours were full Of thee. The fond expression of thy sad dark eyes Remains within my soul; And thy rich voice in its fond witcheries Still holds my heart, in sweet Control. Oh, how my soul has panted to go forth And wrap itself in thine, That all thy thoughts and feelings, at their birth Within thy spirit should Be mine. Life has no pain, no sorrow, no disgrace, No wo, no bitter ill, That should have barr'd me from thy dear embrace, Or stolen from my bliss, One thrill. How can this bleeding heart keep beating on, While thine responds no more? How can this bitter agony be borneâ This desolation at Life's core! What has this rich and radiant earth for me? While sun-light, song, and shade, And breeze, and blossom, only tell of thee, And thou, the joy of all, Art dead! Dead! and I know not where thy beauties lie, In what strange ocean grot Thou sleep'st, with quiet heart, and soulless eye While love, and Lora are Forgot. Oh, wert thou laid beneath the grassy sod Where I might sleep by thee, How sweetly could I die,âbut nowâOh God!â Between us ever rolls The sea! The music with its burden died away In long and plaintive cadence, and it seem'd As if a whisper dwelt upon the wave, Of some young timid spirit, whose fond hopes The weltering waste had shrouded. Sad it seem'd And passionate, and broken by deep sobs, As of intensest suffering, which the breast Lock'd as a sacred treasure, and believ'd It would be sacrilege to speak. But now Another measure comes upon the wind, Sad, sweet, and full of pathos; and the strain Brings on its swell, this history of wo. Wilt thou return no more? my own, my faithful-hearted, To the dear home, where thy precious ones dwell? We are so desolate, since thou, love, hast departed, And left with our spirits the cold word, farewell! A long farewellâ Thou wert too excellent, my early friend, and lover, How my heart priz'd thee no language can tell; Oh, sweet was our communion, love, but now its joys are over, Blighted, and crush'd by that cold word, farewell! A long farewell! Thy first holy kiss, love, I priz'd, a sacred treasure, That on my young lip should in sanctity dwell; Thy last kiss, our parting kiss, seal'd up the fount of pleasure, And wrote on its margin, the cold word, farewell! A long farewell. Thy place is vacant now; thy home is void of gladness, Tears in our eyes, at thy name ever swell; Our hearts are encircled by the heavy chain of sadness, Clasp'd with the adamant cold word, farewell! A long farewell. I garnish'd forth thy home, with all thy favourite flowers, And treasur'd, whatever I knew pleas'd thee well; 'Twas bliss to anticipate the rapture of the hours, When joy-beams should banish the cold word, farewell; A long farewell. I saw the welcome ship, with glad white sails returning, And every pulse throbb'd, with a wild trembling swell; But to my bursting heart, with fond emotion burning, She brought not my love, but his death-cold farewell; A long farewell. Thou wilt return no more! Thy home is 'neath the billow That rings on the dark reef, thine unceasing knell! While I lament in widowhood, upon my lonely pillow, With spirit pierc'd through, by that cold word farewell. Thy last farewell. Farewell! farewell! dwelt long upon the wave, And died like broken-weeping on the shore. Then came another melody, and thus It told its tale of sadness.â In what fair grotto of the deep-green sea Where rich festoons of sea-flowers darkly wave, From trees of brilliant coral, that enwreathe Their priceless branches through the marble cave; Where rings for evermore the solemn knell, Of tinkling waters in the tuneful shell; Where pensive sea-maids come in groups to weep,â Dost thou, my precious Isabella, sleep? Thou beautiful enchantment! Thou wert like A delicately wrought transparency, Through which all angel forms of tenderness, Shone, in the light of maiden purity; Thy cheek was love's pure altar, where he laid With playful hand, his roses pale and red; While bathing in thine eyes of liquid blue, By full-fring'd curtains half concealed from view. Spring has no blossom fairer than thy form; Winter, no snow-wreath, purer than thy mind; The dew-drop trembling to the morning beam, Is like thy smile, pure, transient, heaven-refined;â But ever o'er thy soul, a shadow lay, Still more apparent, in the sunniest day; And ever when to bliss thy heart beat high, The swell subsided in a plaintive sigh. When I would speak of bliss, thou would'st reply Hush! for I feel that all our hopes are vain; Some spirit whispers, that I soon must die; And every thrill of hope, is mix'd with pain. At length thy drooping person prov'd too well That there was poison in life's failing well;â And then we sought youth's freshness to renew Beneath a sky of softer sun, and dew. We journey'd with thee, many a mournful day, Till thou wert weary of the fruitless toil; And pray'd that we would take our homeward way That thou might'st slumber in thy native soil. I knelt and clasp'd thee in a wild embrace, Concealing in thy robes, my anguish'd face; Yet still thy snowy shoulder fill my tears, And still thine Ãolean voice was in mine ears. I felt thy presenceâand the veil of life Was still between the coffin scene, and me.â And hope, and skill maintain'd their anxious strife, Contending strongly with stern Destiny. But when I saw thee deadâand felt the chill Of thy white handâso nervelessâand so stillâ When as my tears fell on thy lovely face, There was no voice, no smile, no consciousness. And when I saw thy formâso fair, so pure, So dear, so precious, cast into the sea! Oh, God of mercy! How did I endure The torture of that fearful agony? Oh, peerless sleeper! Down in the deep sea My heart is in that billowy world, with thee; And still my spirit lingers on the wave That rolls between my bosom, and thy grave. Hark! a full chorus from the mighty deep Drowns every mournful plaint, and loud, and high, Peals forth its solemn anthem. Leaves of life's ephemeral tree, Trembling to the blast, Wherefore sigh so mournfully, That in the blighting, some of ye Are on my bosom cast, Could they find a holier rest Than within my secret breast? Soon your grief will pass away, Soon your lives depart; Will it aught avail your clay Whether grass, or ocean spray, Sigh o'er the broken heart? Which is lightest, earth, or wave, O'er the broken flowret's grave? Wherefore weep for those that rest, Since their griefs are o'er; Whether earth or ocean wave, Be the quiet sleeper's grave, They return no more; Wherefore wish them back again, Bow'd with grief, or rack'd with pain? Surely, blessed are the dead, Dying in the Lord; Whether earth or ocean spread Dark above their silent bed,â Blessed, blessed word! Sweet the dead in Jesus sleep, While the living watch and weep. Leave the peaceful dead with me, Till the morning break, When the sleepers in the sea, With the earth-shrin'd family Shall with joy awake. Then my moaning song shall cease, And all melody be peace. THE SPIRIT'S LYRE. Where pure and fresh life's fountain springs Within the bosom's secret place, The forming hand of nature strings The lyre of human bliss. It has a chord for every thrill Of nature's melting sympathies, And every tone has power to fill The soul with ecstasies. Oh, could its chorus once be full, And not one chord untun'd or riven, Then in its hymn, the human soul Would prove the bliss of heaven. But Fate's stern hand is on the lyre E'er nature wakes the earliest lay, And in her grasp, wire after wire, Snaps with a pang away. The spirit thus can never know The full high melody of bliss; A few faint breathings, wild and low, Are all its happiness. SKETCH. Is this the rich, the proud, the beautifulâ The eloquent in council?âHe who stood To-day with the assembled Senators, And statesmen of his country? He whose voice Charm'd every ear, whose presence fill'd all eyes, Whose eloquence subdued and won all hearts, Except rank enemies, and even from them Took half the rancour, or bow'd down the brow With ire and shame, while loud and long applause Greeted the man whose name they had malign'd, And rang in deaf'ning peals, proclaiming him The wisest and most patriotic son Of his lov'd country. Can this be the man Whose nod confers an honour, and whose smile Makes many a bosom beat tumultuously, Whose ear is greeted oft by the quick sigh Of smitten beauty, as unconsciously She watches the fine figure, which enshrines The richest gems of manly excellence? If soâwhy sits he hereâso desolate In this lone brilliant chamber? Wherefore lies His head upon his hand, so pensively, While from his bosom steal the long sad sighs In slow succession. What does his soul lack Of all that makes life joyous? He has health, And friends, and honour, riches and applause? His soul is joyless,âfor its early buds Of hope and love were blighted, while his heart Was young and ardent, and alive to all The fervour of young love's idolatry. Fate tore his treasure from his bleeding breastâ Yet still in its deep sanctuary lives The bright remembrance of a fair young girl, Who lov'd him with a maiden's earnest love, And smil'd so strangely, when he said farewellâ Aye, smiledâwhile tears lay trembling in the lids Of those meek azure eyes, which unto him Were founts of consolation and delight; She did not say farewell, for she was proud, And would not have him see her weep for him. He knew not then how faithfully he lov'd, Or he had not so tamely let her go. He knew not that the sinking of his soul, As that light figure, with the golden curls, Pass'd from his sight in drooping loveliness, Was but a prelude to eternal gloom And loneliness of spirit. Yet, 'tis so! The world is bright and smiling, but no beam Of all its joyous things, can reach the cold Benighted vacuum, in his yearning heart; And all life's glorious things are mockeries, For there's no gentle heart to echo back The plaudits of his fame, and in its joy Throb with a higher love against his breastâ And he is lonely, mid'st applauding crowds, And poor, surrounded by life's luxuries. And where is sheâthe object of the love, The wither'd flowers of which so shade his heart, Rustling at every touch, and chafing still At every motion, the sore things of life? I saw in a lone forestâfar away, From all the scenes and friends, her young heart lov'd, Within an humble cottage, rudely built And meanly furnish'd, where it seem'd to me That happiness could find no resting place; A meekly drooping woman toiling still As if with mind intent upon her work; Her cheek was faded, and her high brow mark'd With long deep lines of care; and sun and wind Had tarnish'd the pure lilies that once bloom'd Upon her clear complexion. Even her eye, Her light-blue speaking eye, droop'd pensively, As if its long dark lashes sought to hide A tear, that shouldâbut could not be repress'd. It seem'd her soul was busy with sweet thoughts Of far-off scenes, and friends, and joys, and days, That came not to her exile; and she sigh'd With that expression of deep hopelessness, Which no untutor'd heart can comprehend. But when her little one, with its glad smile And voice of music, call'd the thrilling name Of mother, in her earâshe rais'd at once Her drooping brow, and then the radiant smile That lighted up her features, and beam'd forth From the soul's fountain, in those azure eyes, Reveal'd what treasures of delight and love, Were frozen up in its deep treasury. That smile, could he now meet it, might reveal To the lone statesman in the splendid room Th' identity of this sad-faded wife, And the bright joyous girl of seventeen years, With whom he parted, and on whom his eye Has never rested since. Oh! it would give A pang to his strong heart, to meet her nowâ Faded and sad, and blighted as she is,â The slave of an imperious iron-man, Struggling with pains, and cares, and penury; Which press so heavily on her bruis'd heart. That but for Heaven's help, the holy balm Of meek religion, she had long since sunk And died, beneath her burden. Heaven forbid, That he should ever look upon her more! Her memory is bright within his heartâ So let it rest.â And she has learn'd to bear Her burden of affliction patiently, And will not suffer her poor heart to dwell Regretfully with him, who, for slight cause, Cast her so coldly from him. THE SHADOWS OF THE PAST. The Shadows of the Past! Oh, dim and pale, They linger in the paths where joy has been; And Memory lifts at times oblivion's veil, And lights the vista with her magic sheen, Till stricken hearts go mad, and call in vain On joys, that ne'er can thrill their chords again. The Shadows of the Past! Oh, beautiful In the deserted bowers of bliss they stand; So gentle-ey'd, so meekly sorrowful, Extending toward us the familiar hand; Oh! we would bribe Heaven's mercy, to restore Those blessed angels to our arms once more. The Shadows of the Past! Oh, sad they seem, With wither'd rose-buds braided in their hair, And broken tablets of the heart's young dream, Oh! precious were the hopes dissever'd there; Wo to the weary heart, which, all undone, Looks back and weepsâand wanders darkly on! TO SLEEP. Yes, come, for I am weary, and would feel Thy breath of balm, upon my fever'd brow; Soft to my couch thy breezy foot-steps steal, Oh, gentle soother! thou art welcome now. How quietly thou glidest from thy bower Of silken poppies, in the shadowy vale, Where Lethe's waters press the silent shore, And drooping plants their dreamy breath exhale. Now lay thy velvet hand upon mine eyes, Shut out the world, and calm my throbbing brain; Then from the twilight land of mysteries, I pray thee, beckon thine enchanted train. Shadows of gentle memories, dress'd by thee In radiant tissue of immortal light; And yet with semblance of reality, And all familiar to my mental sight. All forms of Love, and Truth, and holy Hope, That laid their short-liv'd offerings on my heart, When I believ'd that flowers would never droop, And braided roses never fall apart. Oh, simple faith of girlhood! Purer, far, Than the cold worship of the world-wise heart, Which desolate, and seam'd with many a scar, Conceals its anguish with a veil of art. Thy dewy fingers only can restore The faded treasures of life's blessed morn: And weave around the heart, which hopes no more, Sweet garlands of the rose that wears no thorn. CHARITY. How meekly beautiful she walks Along the embattled line of life, Regardless of the pomp and power, That mingles in the strife. The glittering toys, that strew the way, Have no attraction in her eyes; How dim they seem, beside the pearl That in her bosom lies. She bears no sword amid the fray, She seeks no laurel, no renown; What should she do with earthly bay, Who heirs a heavenly crown. She seeks notâheeds notâman's applause, She knows 'tis but a passing wind; And his revilings, scoffs, and taunts, Fall harmless on her mind. Careless of these, she passes on, With searching eye and heeding ear, With heart that thrills at every moan, And pities every tear. 'Tis hers to raise the prostrate form, To stanch the wound with tender art; To lay soft leaves of Gilead's balm Upon the bleeding heart. To turn the lifted blade away, And shield the trembler from the blow; To lead the weary on their way, And sooth the wanderer's wo. To aid the bending form of age, And cheer its path of pain and gloom; Pointing the dim eye to the day, That sets not in the tomb. And see, close-folded to her breast, The outcast little orphan's form; She gives it clothing, food, and rest, And shelter from the storm. Her eyes, and heart, are heavenward still, Her hands are to the needy given, To bind each wound, to sooth each ill, And lead the weak toward heaven. What though her eyes are sometimes wet, When venom'd arrows pierce her breast; And blood drips from her weary feet, That know no earthly rest. Still, He, whose footsteps she pursues, Heals all her wounds with holy love, And dries her tears, with dazzling views Of her own Homeâabove. THE LEGEND OF THE OLD WHITE THORN. It was a fine old Hawthorn tree Which cast its grateful shade, Across the brook, which bright and free Along the valley stray'd. There was a bench beneath the tree, Adorn'd with sculpture rare; But none could tell its history, Or who had plac'd it there. And yet it seem'd that to that seat A magic influence drew, The heavy heart, and weary feet, With the descending dew. Oh, many a tender tale of love, Was whisper'd in that shade, And buds of passion interwove, Ah! that such wreaths should fade. Young friendship's bright and holy bands Were braided, 'neath that tree, It was a place for clasping hands, And mingling sympathy. Oft with belov'd companions there, I sat in childhood's hours, Broidering hope's robe of gossamer, With most delightful flowers. In womanhood I came again, With chill'd and weary breast, And spirit school'd to care, and pain, And long estrang'd from rest, And so I sought the old White Thorn, The evening star beneath, To weep the buds untimely torn, From hope's bright rainbow wreath. To muse of all the sweet and fair, Bright eye'd, and full of youth, Whose hearts and hands had mingled there, With simple vows of truth. Then as I wander'd sad and lone, Adown the narrow dell, I almost heard each gentle tone, In childhood lov'd so well. The lost, the chang'd, were there again, And many a treasur'd word, Oh, sweeter than the spring bird's strain, The chords of memory stirr'd. I paus'dâimprovement's iron march, Its footprint there had made; A lofty bridge with massive arch, Across the dell was laid; A small stump, to its centre cleft, Told where the thorn tree stood; And of that honour'd bench was left One mouldering piece of wood, Oh, long and bitterly I wept, Low-seated on the ground, Till down the dell the shadows crept, And dew drops gather'd round. For like a wreath of living flowers Twin'd round that honour'd tree, The memory of all pleasant hours, Had ever been to me. At length there woke a long deep sigh, Like winds green leaves among; It touch'd my soul like melody Remember'd well and long. And then a voice low-toned and clear, Blent with that airy tone, Such spirit voice, as spirits hear, By wood paths dim and lone. Oh, soft, and sweet, and thrillingly, It told its simple tale, And thus in wild sweet harmony, Hymn'd forth its pensive wail. The shadows of the buried pastâ They come at memory's call, And kindly solace to the last, The weariest heart of all. Bright shades of hope, of joy, and love, Of scenes, and seasons gone, Since first the melting voice of love Awoke the old White Thorn. The old White Thorn, two hundred years, The pride of this lone spot, And now, (Oh, bless thy flowing tears) By all but thee forgot. Here feelings beautiful and deep Have pour'd their treasures dear, And bitterer tears than thou canst weep, Have fall'n like rain drops here. Young hearts have writh'd beneath this tree, With anguish strong and wild, And here was wrought the destiny, Of nature's loveliest child. 'Twas when this richly cultur'd scene Where pleasant dwellings stand, And cities crowd with dazzling sheen By stream, or ocean strand, Where Science's august halls are trod By throngs of eager feet; Where in the hallow'd courts of God, The humble-hearted meet; Where art has built his myriad domes, And plies his magic toil; And cheerful Agriculture comes Each morn to bless the soil, When all this scene from sea to sea, Where e'er the sun looks down, Was clad in nature's fair array, And wore her leafy crown, Her emerald crown of forest leaves Inwreath'd with blossom'd stems, And which at morn she interweaves, With myriad flashing gems. And here her own wild children dwelt, The beautiful and free; The fearless and the fleet, who felt Their being ecstasy. And here were songs, and radiant wings, For nature's God has given Bright plumes to all melodious things, That they may fly toward heaven. And underneath the living shade High-arch'd from tree to tree, The dusky featur'd hunter stray'd, With foot and spirit free. His soul was like his native land, Majestic, wild, and vast; Its very shadow darkly grand O'er wastes of verdure cast. His passions, like the mountain wind, Resistless, fierce, and sure; And kindly feelings in his mind, Like fountains deep and pure. Oh, hush the lay. I must not sing, For echo haunts the vale. The Ãolean's fitful murmuring Suits best such passion tale. LENNORAH. She was a white bud on a red rose tree, A perfect woman in her gentleness Amid a savage horde. Her face was fair And very beautiful. The copper hue Lay not on her fair brow, or pearly cheek. She was a wonder in the wilderness Amid her wild compeers. Her dimpled mouth Was rich with pleasant witcheries, and her eyes Those large dark lustrous eyes, were full of soulâ The soul of woman, which is composite Of love, and trust, and truth, a perfect braid Entwin'd with her existence. Wo to him Who breaks one shining strand, destroying thus The harmony which is her all of bliss, Her all of beauty, and her all of worth; (For what is woman lacking fervent love, Or trust in man, or most of all pure truth? These are her wealth, and these are always hers Till he to whom she gives the precious braid In carelessness or passion severs it; And thenceforth she is wretched and undone, And rest of her high value. Oh man! man! That thou should'st ever be the reckless child To tarnishâor to breakâand then despise The dearest, richest, and most coveted Of thy good Father's gifts.) Lennorah's eyes I said were full of soul, but oh, her smile, Irradiating eyes, and cheeks, and mouth With beauty's perfect lustre! And her voice, The very music of soft sympathies, And then the movements of her perfect formâ All grace and ease, combin'd to make her one Who seem'd a creature from a brighter sphere Astray in this coarse world. She never felt Communion with the children of her tribe, But found companionship in breezy woods, With tender buds, and young and sweet-breath'd flowers, And singing birds. The sun, and moon, and stars Held converse with her, in their own strange speech Of glory, beauty, and magnificence. And she would sit upon a mossy rock And hold communion with the voyagers Of those white clouds, that flit so gracefully Along the ether. These were all her friends, Her intimate companions, and she found High happiness in intercourse with them. The braves, and fleet young hunters of her tribe Regarded her with worship, as good men Regard a saint, as we regard high things Which are beyond our reach, the beautiful Which are not made for us, which our desires Dare not aspire to. Thus she dwelt alone Shrin'd in the pure affections of her race, A marvel and a mystery to them all. She lov'd the holy night, and used to stand In lonely wood-paths at the midnight hour Communing with the creatures whose soft wings Shed balm upon the intellectual world, Soothing and hushing weariness and care And e'en disease with dewy spell of sleep Which binds the senses that enthral the soul, And lifts the heavy curtain from its eyes, So that the presence of the spiritual Is gloriously reveal'd. (They then assume The forms of those we love, the beautiful Who bless the earth, or walk the spirit land, Each in the dear familiar drapery In which we lov'd to clasp them. Then we hold Such sweet communion with the blessed ones Who weep no more, not e'en in sympathy, And hearts which during long and weary years Have been all dark and silent, see once more The blessed light of love, and dance to bliss; And pleasant melody of household words Falls on them like the blessed rain of heaven Upon the open flowers. Oh holy dreams! Alas! that we should ever wake to weep.) Thus would she stand beneath the smiling heaven Amid the gentle spirits visible To her pure eyes, which, in their mysteries Commingled with her soulâThe aerial groups That minister to mortals, to the flowers, Green leaves, and living waters, moving still Upon the night wind, lov'd to touch her brow, And hold communion with her. Down this dell Just where the streamlet twines its silver thread Into the noble river's broad bright chain, Deep in the bosom of the quiet vale Lay like a peaceful flock, the cluster'd tents Of her dark people! Many a summer eve While I was cherishing the infancy Of my peculiar charge, the old White Thorn, (You lov'd the tree, therefore I tell it you,) Lennorah came, and with her little hands Assisted in its culture, while her head Was yet no higher than the lily bell, Which she so worshipp'd. Then I lov'd the child And her meek innocence, which made her meet Companion for the creatures of the air, Which guard the fragrant buds; and we, who dwelt Within this now almost deserted dell, Were pleased to talk with her, who understood The softest whispers of our zephyr-wings. Thus she grew up in our companionship, Unblemish'd, sweet, and purely beautiful, As fairest morning lily, which she lov'd To twine amongst the midnight of her hair. There lay a fallen cedar, where you sit, And its sad spirit watching its decay, Oft mov'd a pensive chord, in her heart's lyre, And this was all she knew of grief or pain. 'Twas, in her eighteenth summer, a bright day, Toward the last of June, she had been out On yonder mountain, and, in maiden glee, Had caught a fawn, a little spotted fawn, Not more than three days old, and the young thing, As fawns will do when captur'd, follow'd her With timid footsteps, and a trusting look In its large quick bright eyes, which sought her face With innocent confiding. She had tied Her broider'd girdle round its slender neck, And thus was leading it, with loving words, Breath'd forth in music, while her radiant face Beam'd love, and pity, and a victor's joy, Upon her gentle captive. She was clad In snowy costume, in her nation's style, Border'd with gorgeous broidery, and her brow Was crowned with fragrant wreaths of living flowers, As yet unwilted. On this spot she stood. Oh! could'st thou see a picture like to her, As then she look'd, in this delightful spotâ Oh, how the beautiful have pass'd away!â Who gaz'd upon her then, with all his soul, In rapture beaming from his speaking eyes? On yonder lime-stone cliff, just opposite That bare bleach'd rock, but then it was not so, For green moss mantled it, and violets White, blue and yellow, crimson honey-cups, And wild columbines, garnish'd every cleft And little hollow, while the richest shrubs Wove it a coronet, and over all Sweet birches interlaced their flexile twigs, And cast a cool and fragrant shade, all day, Upon the now bare rock. So like the heart Bereft of nature's sheltering sympathies,â Just there he stood. A man, mature of years, A princely son of Spain, of noble form, And perfect in the august majesty Of manly beauty. On his ample brow Was traced a depth of thought, a strength of mind, A height of genius, a nobility Of soul and nature; while his eyes and lips Were rich with all the tender sympathies That live within the heart. He was a man, Form'd to be worshipp'd by all gentle hearts, Which cling confidingly with earnest trust, And love to adoration. He had come From his own storied land, to read the page Of nature, in her own wild majesty, Of forest wide and pathless as the sea, Of mountains crown'd with rock, and plum'd with pines, Of clear lakes lying in their emerald frames, As made by heaven to mirror her whole face; Of mighty rivers, sleeping in rich vales, Lull'd by their own deep, dreamy melody, And rapid waters chanting wildest songs Along the rugged dells, where all strange shapes Of majesty and beauty congregate. But most of all, he sought to read the souls Of her own dark-brow'd and free-footed race, The hunters, who have never yet been tamed, Till their high hearts were broken. He had rang'd Plain, hill, and valley, in the checquer'd shade Of deep continuous forests. He had seen A thousand wonders, and enrich'd the stores Of his mind's treasury, with fair images Of all the great, august and beautiful. But when he saw Lennorah, he forgot That aught on earth was lovely, but herself. He had known many maidens, and had been The envied of all gallant cavaliers, And oft, perchance, had fondly said, I love And been belov'd, too truly,âbut his heart Had never felt its inmost chambers fill'd With female tenderness and excellence, And so it had rov'd on, a weary race, Still seeking perfect loveliness, and love Which only could suffice it. Now he saw A form of loveliness, surpassing all That ever he had dream'd of, and he said, If innocence and truth exist on earth, Here certainly they should delight to dwell.â Long, long he gaz'd, till this then lovely spot, And that fair child, with her four-footed mate, Were painted on his heart indelibly, By love's warm pencilling. At length the thought That she might leave the spot, and so be lost To him for ever, came upon his mind. So beckoning his dark-fac'd interpreter, He ventur'd to approach her, with pretence Of purchasing the fawn. At first, the maid Observ'd the native hunter, and her eye Grew bright with pleasure, and her voice rang out So like the tones of a melodious bell, As she display'd her captive. Then she mark'd The white-brow'd stranger, and shrunk meekly back With soft timidity, while o'er her face Was spread the spell of wonder, which gave way To admiration, then she bow'd her head With reverence nigh to worship. Yet, through all These momentary changes, there beam'd out A native dignity, a maiden pride, The seal of purity.â 'Twere long to tell How day by day, they met beneath the shadeâ The white-thorn's shade, for it had now become A tree of wide-spread limbs, and cluster'd leaves, And here they met, because, they first met here. And she soon learn'd his language, for her heart Drank in his accents, and instinctively Found out their meanings, and her clear ton'd voice Was unto his an echo.â What remains? She lov'd him as an artless woman's soul Alone can love, with an idolatry, To which all other feelings must bow down. Ah, even the world, that idol of great men, To which kings, conquerors, statesmen bow themselves So sacrificed unto it, and becomes An empty nothingness. (What is it else?) For which she leaves for ever willingly Home with its blessed chain of faithful hearts, Enwreath'd with flowers, which ever in their breasts Retain the fragrance and the holy dew Of Paradise.â(Oh, many a stricken one Walks wearily along life's lonely way, Within its mantle folding to the soul As life's sole treasure, a few wither'd leaves Of these home-blossoms. Steep'd perchance with tears The sweet things areâor haply the death mould Lies chill upon themâyet unto that heart They are a blessed balm.) She was his own With that full confidence of perfect love Which leans upon its object, with such faith, As draws the infant to its mother's breast. She lov'd, and she was happy. Ye who know Can answerâIs there aught of happiness, Beneath the azure firmament of heaven, To be compared with that full flood of bliss Which fills existence, when heart springs to heart In love's entire communion? Days went by Uncounted in that bright delicious dream, Which gather'd all the sweet, the beautiful, The pure, and never-dying things of life Into one godlike vision, which it nam'd Its own belov'd. And his heart clung to her With such a sense of rest as weary birds Returning on a balmy summer eve From airy wanderings amidst earth's glorious things, Feel, as they fold their wings above their nest, Within the covert of a fairy bower. Their love was beautiful. Her's the wild joy Of some glad child, possessing the first rose Which ever caught its eye, and all entranc'd With fragrance, and pure beauty. His the bliss Of one who finds a treasure, which has been The object of long years of weary search, And which attained, leaves naught to be desir'd. And closer grew the bond between their hearts, As days of intercourse reveal'd to each The other's excellence, and deep pure love. We of the spiritual knew that such bliss Was not a flower to live in this cold world, And warn'd Lennorah with our unheard words, Which thrill the spirit, with that pensive tone, Felt as a shadow of approaching ill; And she would weep, and tremble, with a fear Of unseen danger, and a restlessness, That long'd as if to find a resting-place For the o'er-burden'd heart; and then she clung With deeper trust unto her heart's lov'd lordâ What other refuge had she? It was fall. A beautiful bright day of early fall, When light and shadow, fruits and gorgeous flowres, Leaves, green and scarlet, crimson and bright gold, Seem trembling to the holy melody Pour'd forth by congregations of glad birds, As if all sweet and bright, and tuneful things Had gather'd in the rich and mellow sheen To hold a carnival of all delights Before they pass away. Lennorah sat Beneath the thorn that day, a part of all The glad, and beautiful, oh, beautiful She was, with that pure face, and perfect form, All animate with soul. And she was glad, For he who lov'd her, he whom she so lov'd, Was there beside her. Fondly, trustingly She gaz'd into his eyes, while both her hands Were softly, warmly clasping one of his, And broken sentences of tenderness Came sweetly murmuring from her rose-bud lips; And through her heart throbb'd almost painfully The flood-tides of delight. She did not heed The beauty of the season, or the hour, And yet they blended their sweet influence With every pulse she felt. But he was sad. With all these treasures clustering round his heart, And such a wealth of love in his embraceâ His soul was sorrowful; and in his eyes A troubled shadow rested, like a cloud Upon the sun-bright sky. But in her bliss She heeded not that shadow. Could she dream Of sorrow, at his side, at such a time Of trancing loveliness, through earth, and heaven; And all her being was one flood of bliss. Poor girlâher happiness was all complete, And like the ripen'd treasures of the year, Just ready to depart. Close to his breast The innocent creature nestled her bright face, And gently murmur'd, oh, I am so blestâ My heart is burden'd with its happiness, Just like a rose, droop'd down with fragrant dew. He drew her to his bosom, and a tear, A big warm tear wrung from that strong man's heart, Fell on her glowing cheek. Bless thee, she cried, For that one tear, the sweetest purest pledge Of human tenderness. But do not weep, One other drop of bliss would break my heartâ Dear love, he cried, dear unsuspecting child! And his stern frame which never shook till then, Now trembled like a willow by the brook When fierce tornados grapple with its stem. She rais'd her faceâher rapture radiant face And glanc'd into his eyes. Oh, what a change Came o'er her being then. The spirit light Of love's deep bliss went out, in icy gush Of apprehensive agony which chill'd Her life in all its channels. With one gasp, One quick convulsive shudder, she sunk down, Pale, still, and almost senseless. With fond words And sweet assurances, he sought to calm Her agony of fear; and then she wept With sobs so deep and painful, that he fear'd, Her life would burst forth with them. Still he sooth'd, Till she at length lay passive in his arms, And pour'd out tears like water, while his own Flow'd freely in big silent drops, and lay Like liquid diamonds, in her raven hair. At length, he said, Lennorahâgentle love, I pray thee calm thy sorrow. I am sad, Because I am oblig'd to part from thee Only a little while, love.âOne short year, It soon will pass Lennorahâoh, weep on, Thy tears thus check'd, I fear will break thy heart, My king commands me homeâI must obey; But doubt me not, I will return to thee, For all my joys, my hopes, my every wish, My peace abide with thee,âand when again This season comes to these old glorious woods, I will come with it. Live for me, my love And keep thy young heart whole, thy dear eyes bright, And all thy beauties fresh and pure as now, That so, at my return I may embrace My own unchang'd Lennorah. Fear not, loveâ In one short year I surely will return, And dwell with thee for ever. Do not mourn, For grief will kill thee, and when I return With heart alive with hope, and love for thee, Think what would be my agony to find, That thou wert cold, and hidden from my eyes, And burning heart, by clods of heavy earth. The very thought is torture to my soul, I dare not think of it. Say thou wilt live.â Yes, my own worshipp'd lord, for thy dear sake, I will endure thine absence, till the time Which thou hast named expires. But mark me, then, If thou return not, I shall surely die.â Not so, Lennorah. I might be detain'd A little longer than the year. If so, Doubt not my constancy, but wait in hope, For death alone shall hinder my return. Now let me lead thee to thy fairy bower, And pass the night in bliss beside thee there; To-morrow I depart.â Days pass'd awayâ Glad days of sunlight, rob'd and voic'd like spring,â Days of cold rain, when leaves come down in showers, Like flocks of wounded birds, that flutter by And drop with out-spread wings, that never more Shall bear them from the earth,âdays of dark clouds And fitful winds, and spots of deep blue sky, And wandering sunbeams,âbut in all alike Lennorah sat long hours beneath the thorn, Communing with her spirit's absent lord, Recalling all that he had done or said, And laying all his words of tenderness, Like fragrant balsams on her aching heart, While she repeated over and again, His promises of truth, and sure return. December came, and when we heard her voice, We watchers of the dell, lock'd up the buds That held our treasuresâLeft our blessing here, And pass'd with warmth and beauty to the south. But with the early south wind we return'd To wake our sleeping treasures, and unfold A world of balm and beauty. 'Neath my tree I found Lennorah, with her loving fawn, Her innocent companion, which no lure Of its own species,âof the green hill-side, The clear sweet water, or the dewy shade, Could sever from her side one little hour. (Oh how the poor dumb creatures in their love Put to the blush, man's boasted constancy) Her hands were clasp'd upon his glossy neck, And on her polish'd arm her brow reclin'd. She still was beautiful, but there had come A change upon her beauty. 'Twas no more The loveliness of childish innocence, But in her eye, and on her lip and cheek, Were written care and thought. She had become A woman, with her dower of hopes and fears, Her earnest, agonizing sleepless love. The name so dear to her was on her lips, His words were treasur'd in her memory, He fill'd her spirit, as the azure heaven Fills with its radiant glory some clear lake. Here every day she came, to dream again, The blessed day-dreams of her pure young love Over and over. When the sun went down She felt a joy, the only joy she knew, That one more day of pain and loneliness Was lifted from her heart. So summer pass'd, And autumn came again, the blessed time Which bounded the horizon of her hope, With radiant fields of bliss. Days came, and went, And hope grew agony.âIf man could know The burning sickness of the woman's heart, Who loves, and fears, and waits for his return; Who sits alone in the familiar spot Where first she sat beside him, and resign'd Her destiny, with all its precious hopes, Just in their summer blooming, unto him, Requiring no return, except the right To love, and trust him. Could he see the zeal With which she cherishes her faith in him, Collecting all sweet memories of his love, And gathering them around her aching heart, To hide it from despair, while day by day Her hopes grow fainter, more intense her love, Her fears more like the throttling agony, Of one who struggles in the dim cold sea Far out from land or ship,âcould man but feel The weariness, that cuts into her life. While o'er her tear-wet pillow broods the night Slow lingering in the pathway of the morn, And holding back the hope, which whispers still To-morrow he will comeâOh, could he feel Her bitter agony, when that hope dies With day's departing radiance, and despair Pours out alternate pangs of frost and fire Upon her heart-stringsâtill all paralyz'd, The heart forgets to beatâor loves no moreâ Thus poor Lennorah watch'd, and hop'd, and wept, Until her heart grew cold, her dark eye dim, And yet he came not. 'Twas a chilly day In bleak November, yet the sad girl came And sat her down to watch. Her eyes were wet, Her cheeks were pallid and her steps were slow, And she mov'd wearily, as if her life Had grown a grievous burden. Night came down, And still she linger'dâoh, I knowâI know, She cried, that he is near. And there she sat With eyes dilated, gazing through the gloom, Along the wood-path, with her head inclin'd, Her dark locks thrown aside, to give her ear The greatest freedom, while her nerves were strain'd Even to agonyâand all her soul, With strong intensity of torture bent On one sole hope, the dearest, and the last. Whene'er the autumn winds spread suddenly Their fitful pinions near her, and awoke A sound as of approaching steps, or when The spirits of the night, on white-cloud cars Came riding on the radiance of the moon, And threw light shadows, which along the path Took form of him she watch'd for, how she gasp'd With agony of hope. But when at length Conviction that her watchings were in vain Came o'er her spirit, she shriek'd wildly out, So that the mountain echoes answer'd back; And then the bitter fountain of her heart Was broken up. She wept, as none can weep Until the venom'd shaft of misery Is driven through the soul. Her poor dumb friend Press'd closely to her side, and lick'd her hands, Essaying all he could to comfort her, But she wept wildly on. And where was he, The so belov'd, so long'd and waited for?â In his own country, circled by old friends, Possess'd of all the luxuries of wealth, And crown'd with princely honours,âis it strange If she the dark-eyed simple-hearted child Was half forgotten? Is it strange that he Amid the courtly dames, and polish'd maids Of his own Spain, should wonder how his heart Had own'd affection for a savage girl?â And yet at times his soul went out to her, As one would turn from artificial flowers, And cold and heavy gems, to catch the breath And feel the beauty of the summer-rose. And when her image came to him in dreams, Her bright glad image, with its radiant smile, And love, the artless offering of a heart Too pure to need concealmentâOh, he felt That that poor maiden with her wealth of love Was worth all his possessions, and his heart Reproach'd him with his falsehood, and the grief Which prey'd upon her, in her loneliness,â But day, with gilded pomp, and heartless pride, Dispell'd the tender feeling.â Time sped on And it again was fall. But what a change The white man's magic had effected here. The hunter's foot-print was no longer seen Along the dell, or on the mountain tops, Or by the river-side, where from old times The weekwam village lay. A few short years Had swept away the forest; and the plough Had turn'd up every hearth-stone in the vale. And there were cultur'd fields and orchard trees, And painted dwellings, and the busy hum Of much machinery. Every thing was chang'd Except along this deep and narrow dell Which cultivation deem'd quite valueless, And where the busy white man seldom then Impress'd his foot-steps. 'Twas a pleasant hour, The sun was low, and threw his slanting beams In showers of trembling glory over all The beauty of the landscape. Up the dell With lingering steps, and head droop'd sadly down A noble form advanc'd. It was the sameâ The noble Spaniard!âWhy had he return'd To this new world! and wherefore came he here? And what impell'd him to sit down and weep Beneath the white thorn tree? Oh, bitterly That strong man weptâas if his dearest hope Lay buried at his feetâas if his soul Felt utter desolation.â Lightsomely A female form came down the mountain-sideâ And stood upon that rock, with timid eye Peering from out the closely woven screen Which still adorn'd itâup and down the dell, As fearful of the presence of a foe.â The red man had remov'd far to the west, They could not mingle with the heartless race Who desecrated all their ancient haunts And chang'd the face of natureâSo the tribe In mournful silence took a long farewell Of their belov'd and consecrated home. And none had e'er come back, to look once more E'en on their father's gravesâexcept this girl Of whom her people said, she had convers'd So much and long with spirits, that her soul Had grown estrang'd from nature's sympathies. They deem'd her holy, and an oracle, But she was craz'd, poor girl! and every year Just at the falling of the first bright leaves She came a weary journey, all alone (Except a noble deer, which day and night Was ever at her side, a trusty guard,) To sit beneath the thorn, and chant wild lays Of love, and hope, and sorrow. Time had dealt Most leniently with her, for save a shade As of the land of death, which dimm'd her brow And lay upon her features, there had pass'd No change on that young face. But in her eye Oh, there was darkness, like the midnight heaven O'er which the wild aurora of the north Displays its lurid phantoms, and strange forms Of dim and fearful shapes, and august sights Of beauty terribleâinspiring awe.â At length the glances of those dreamy eyes Took in the weeper underneath the thorn,â A moment motionless, and breathlessly With lips apart and wild dilated eye She stood,âand then sprang from the crested rock As some wild bird, affrighted from her nest Darts from the thicket. Scarce an instant pass'd Till she was kneeling at that weeper's side Nestling her glowing face upon his breast To which he prest her fondly, fervently With love, and joy, and wonder. Not a word Was utter'd in that trembling ecstasy, That blissful intermingling of two souls That in each other found all happiness.â There was no chiding question of the past, The present with its overwhelming tide Of full assurance, fill'd and bless'd their souls. And when at length Lennorah rais'd her face The mellow light of the September sun Ne'er look'd on features more serenely calm, Or met an eye more radiant with the beams Of rational thanksgiving. Many years Of mingled life were theirs. And many an hour They sat together on the sculptur'd bench Carv'd with historic heraldry of Spain, Brought hither as a relic of the past And plac'd beneath that bower of love and truth, The sacred Old White Thorn. But see upon the dewy East The full moon pours her light, My tree is deadâMy mission pastâ My legend toldâGood night. THE HEMLOCK TREE. ADDRESSED TO MY BOY. This Hemlock treeâthis Hemlock tree With foliage thick and dark; It hath a lesson, boy, for thee, Which I would have thee mark. See here within its sheltering breast Secure from sun or storm, The wild birds' callow fledgelings rest, Within their cradle warm. The helpless things have naught to fear, So quiet is their home; No prowling foe can reach them here, No hawk or vulture come. But when their wings are plum'd, and strong, They'll fly the native bower; And pour their souls in tender song, To every blushing flower. The Hemlock will be lonely then, And many a plaintive sigh, Will ask the warblers back again, Of winds that wander by. At morn no dear familiar hymn Shall hail the holy light, Which wakes amongst her leaflets dim, The diamonds of the night. No vesper song at close of day Shall thrill her darken'd breast, And with the daylight melt away, In sacred peace, and rest. But when the wind-wing'd thunder shower Rides out upon the gale, Appalling beast, and bird, and flower With whirlwind, fire, and hail, With drooping head, and ruffled plume, And low and broken strain, The wounded bird, perchance, will come To this retreat again. See'st thou no emblem here, my boy? Is not this Hemlock tree A type of her whose hope, and joy, Is centred all in thee? Her bosom is thy shelter now, A dear and quiet place, Where thou may'st rest thy sunny brow Secure in her embrace. But when young manhood's fires shall burn, In heart, in eye, in brain; And the strong limb, and spirit, spurn E'en pure affection's chain; I know that thou wilt wander forth Where hope shall point the way; To seek a paradise on earth Where heavenly creatures stay. Where streams of thrilling rapture flow 'Neath love's immortal bowers; Where laurel crowns profusely grow, With wreaths of golden flowers. Thy home will be deserted then, And loneliness and fears, Will gather clouds of care and pain Around my waning years. And many a vainly yearning care Will follow on thy track; And many a fond and fervent prayer Will ask the wanderer back. While thou art ranging free, and wide, Pursuing wealth, or fame, And scarce remembering in thy pride Thy mourning mother's name. The boy she nurs'd, the boy she loves, To whom her heart is grown, Forgets, while joyously he roves, That she will weep alone. But when affliction wrings thy heart, When sickness bends thy frame; When falsehood strikes thee with her dart, Or vilifies thy name; When disappointment's bitter draught O'erflows the cup of joy; And cold despair's transfixing shaft Has pierc'd thy heart, my boy; Then, having prov'd the promise vain That lur'd thy feet to rove, Thou'lt think amid thy grief and pain, Of homeâand mother's love. Ay, boy! when all the summer flowers Shall wither, and decay; When from the grove, and fragrant bowers The verdure falls away, The Hemlock, green and shadowy still, A safe retreat will prove; And mark me, boy, through every ill Such is a Mother's Love. ELIJAH ON MOUNT HOREB. 'Twas burning summer o'er the wilderness, And on the lofty mountains, that look up With heads uncover'd reverently to heaven; The shrubs were fainting in the noonday heat, And weary song-birds droop'd their airy wings In silence, midst the still and wilted leaves. The herbage lay all languid on the rocks; The sweet breath of the aromatic vines And fair young flowers, of glorious forms and hues, That grew in ravine, cleft, or narrow dell, Lay on the still air, round the drooping cups A very weight of fragrance, and a hush Of sickly languor, brooded over all The rough and thirsty landscape. Lo! there comes An aged wanderer from the wilderness. With faltering step, he leaned upon his staff, While toiling up the stern and rocky side Of the majestic Horeb. His white locks Were wet with perspiration, and his breast Heav'd quick, and painfully; while his worn feet Flinch'd from the heated rocks; yet on he climb'd, Until the flutter of the breeze's wing, Shook balm upon his parch'd and quivering lips, And bath'd his burning eye-balls. Gratefully He rais'd his face toward heaven, and then the breeze, Lifted his damp white locks, and kiss'd his brow, And wooed him sweetly to repose and peace. He sat him down, that hungry, tired old man, Whose tongue was swoll'n with thirst, and thank'd his God, For that delicious airy visitant, Which sporting now amongst the vines that grew In tufts upon the rock, by which he sat Show'd ripe red berries clustering 'mongst the leaves. His joy gush'd forth in praises, as he fed Upon the cooling fruit, which quench'd his thirst, And half appeas'd his hunger. Seeking then A resting-place, he found a rugged cave Extending deep into the mountain's breast; He enter'd it, and laid him down to sleep Upon its mossy floor. And who was he That silver-hair'd, lone wanderer? He was one, Whose spirit was so pure, that God, himself, Held high communion with him. Yet the world Hated and hunted him, from place to place, Dogging his steps, and thirsting for his life, And he had pray'd for death. Yet now he lay Calmly in that lone cavern. Holy peace Was nestling in his bosom, and his brow Was placid as the moonlit summer sky. Sleep lay upon his eyelids, as the dew, Lies on the clos'd corolla of the flow'rs, In cool refreshing beauty. No fond friend Was there, to watch his slumber, yet the God Who fills all space, was with his servant there In that vast solitude. With august voice, He woke him from his sleep, bade him go forth And stand upon the rock, before the Lord. He roseâwent forthâand stood on the sheer rock, Waiting for God's appearing. Hark! From far A fearful rushing sound. The heavens grew darkâ Is God approaching? Lo! a strong fierce wind Rushes upon the mountain, tearing up The shrubs, and herbage, from its arid breast, Lifting huge rocks from their eternal beds, And dashing them adown the fearful steeps, With such appalling sound as if the world, Were falling into atoms; while the wind Shriek'd terribly amongst the caves, and clefts, And splinter'd rocks. 'Tis pastâand all is stillâ God was not in the wind. Now wakes a soundâ A low deep moaning, in the mountain's breast, Which trembles fearfully, as if she felt The fearful presence. Now her bosom heaves With strange convulsions, and she bellows forth Her agony, while the eternal rock On which the servant of Jehovah stood Shook like a leaf, upon an aspen bough, And mighty rocks fell down, and caverns yawn'd, And the whole mountain totter'd. It is pastâ God was not in the earthquake. Lo! there comes A more appalling wonder.âSurely now The Terrible is near. Surging along Above the wilderness, a flood of fire Is sweeping toward old Horeb. In its way The atmosphere burts into whirls of fire With frightful detonations. 'Tis too much For mortal man to meet. With pallid fear He shrunk within his cave. The fire rush'd past, And vanish'dâBut God was not in the fire. A pure breeze follow'd the fierce element, Heaven was serene, and on Mount Horeb lay The downy wing of silence.âOn that calm There came a still small voice. 'Tis God. The servant felt his sovereign nigh; He wrapp'd his face within his mantle folds, And at the entrance of that hallow'd cave, With head bow'd down, and meek attentive soul Held converse with Jehovah. THE WILD-WOOD HOME. Oh, show me a place like the wild-wood home, Where the air is fragrant, and free, And the first pure breathings of morning come In a gush of melody. She lifts the soft fringe from her dark blue eye, With a radiant smile of love, And the diamonds that o'er her bosom lie, Are bright as the gems above. Where noon lies down in the breezy shade Of the glorious forest bowers, And the beautiful birds, from the sunny-glades, Sit nodding amongst the flowers, While the holy child of the mountain spring Steals past with a murmur'd song, And the honey-bees sleep in the bells that swing Its garlanded banks along. Where day steals away with a young bride's blush, To the soft green-couch of night, And the moon throws o'er with a holy hush Her curtain of gossamer-light. And the seraph that sings in the hemlock-dell, Oh, sweetest of birds is she, Fills the dewy breeze with a trancing swell Of melody rich and free. There are sumptuous mansions, with marble walls, Surmounted by glittering towers, Where fountains play in the perfum'd halls Amongst exotic flowers: They are suitable homes for the haughty in mind, Yet a wild-wood home for me; Where the pure bright streams, and the mountain-wind, And the bounding heart, are free. RECEDING JOYS. Oh softly lies the wild-wood shade Above the modest flowers; And oft as through the woods I stray'd, I fancied that sweet spirits stay'd Amongst the rich green bowers. For there were low sweet whisperings Of bliss too pure for earth, Soft music, as of tuneful strings, And flutterings as of viewless wings, With bursts of silvery mirth. And unseen beings seem'd to tread, Amongst the bending flowers, And young buds droop'd the modest head, As if they heard love's wooings said And half confessed his powers. Oh! pleasant is the wild-wood shade With bird songs blithe and free; Bright streams, where playful grasses wade, And fragrant winds that love the shade Of the old rustling tree. Yet round my dwelling year by year The forest melts away; Now indistinct its bowers appear, And faintly falls upon my ear Its mingled melody. My childhood was a fairy scene All spangled o'er with flowers, Where bands of spirits, all but seen, Were sporting in the radiant sheen That trembled through the bowers. And whispering of celestial love Liv'd on the scented wind; And soft low cooings of the dove, And waters murmuring through the grove Their dreamy songs combin'd. Then every dark-brow'd cloud that came Wore heaven's resplendent bow; And every dew-drop was a gem, Dropp'd from some angel's diadem, On lovely things below. Yes, childhood was a wild-wood scene, Where guileless creatures dwelt; Where nature wore her own bright mien, Where only innocence was seen, And love, and rapture felt. But farther from me, year by year, Those blessed things remove; Dim to my mind these bowers appear, And faintly to my inward ear Are borne those hymns of love. THE LOST CHILD. Alone, beneath the heavy shade In forest, thick, and wild, With timid eye and footstep, stray'd A poor bewilder'd child. Along the cold swamp's weedy edge He held his devious way, Where coil'd and hissing in the sedge, The hideous serpent lay. The demon wolf with cry of death Leap'd past him in the chase, The wild deer linger'd in his path To scan the stranger's face. And pale, and full of agony That little face appeared; And terror fill'd his soft blue eye At every sound he heard. His yellow curls were bare and wet, His little coat was torn, And stains of blood were on his feet, By reckless travel worn. His little heart was sick with fear, His brain was wild and weak, And hunger's pains so hard to bear, Had blanch'd his rosy cheek. And still by every mossy spot Where pheasant berries hide, He soughtâand when he found them not, Oh! bitterly he cried. Four days, that tangled forest through He sought his home in vain, Fond hearts were breaking there, he knew, To see his face again. Mother! oh, mother! was his cry, Until his voice grew weak, And throat, and tongue all parch'd, and dry, And then he could not speak. The silent shades are gathering now With dark and dewy wings, Forming in dell, and valley low, Dim shades of fearful things. His frame with curdling horror shook, His heart grew cold as clay, He crept into a shelter'd nook, Crouch'd down, and tried to pray. And then he thought that God was near, To watch above his bed; And every agonizing fear, And phantom horror fled. The pangs of hunger died away, And grief withdrew its sting, And slumber o'er his spirit lay Soft as an angel's wing. And then he dream'd sweet dreams of home, With all its love, and bliss, The rural feast, the lighted room, The mother's tender kiss. The little face grew calm, and white, His slumber still, and deep,â Sweet boy, thy sorrows end to-night, Thou wilt not wake to weep. Motherâhe whisper'd languidly, And hugg'd the dewy sodâ 'Tis doneâhe wakes to ecstasy, And sees, the face of God. Tell us, ye white hair'd wanderers, In life's dark desert ways; Ye who have sow'd your path with tears So many weary days; Ought we to mourn for him who lies In that wild dell alone; Whose weary feet, and weeping eyes, Have found their rest so soon? SPRING. The beautiful spring, the generous spring, She has come to her own again; From the gem-like isles, that are sleeping in smiles, On the breast of the southern main. She comes with her angels, a beautiful train Of the sinless, the bright, and free; Who joyously fling from each glittering wing A sparkle of melody. The sun in his gladness smiles on the young spring, From his sapphire throne on high, Shining down from above, like the spirit of love From his home in a clear blue eye. The fountains gush up like a young maiden's joy, And flow with a silvery song; And the rivers give out a melodious shout, As their plum'd waves march along. The bright dandelions bespangle the vest Of green velvet, that earth has put on, And Zephyrus weaves of the young forest leaves, Her silver and emerald crown. There's a hymn on the earth, there's a hymn on the sea, There are hymns on the balm-breathing wind; There's a flush of delight, on the fair and the bright, And love is with beauty combin'd. There's a rich gush of life in the myriad breasts, That feel the warm breathings of spring, There's praise all abroad, to the bountiful Lord, And a free-will offering. The beautiful spring, the generous spring, She has come to her own again: With a message of love, from the bowers above, Where the pure and the beautiful reign. TO âAN UNKNOWN FRIENDâ Who sent me a Book. There's treasure in thine offering. Every page Is rich with pearls, as brilliant and as pure, As Genius ever gather'd from the deeps Of the unbounded ocean-flood of mind, And set in priceless clusters, to enrich The cabinets of those who gather gems That shall shed lustre to eternity. And yet one little word, in pencil trac'd Upon a snowy margin, is to me Most precious of its treasures. It is like A sweet pale rose, twin'd in a diamond wreath. I place the bright cold jewels on my brow To hold their high communion with my brain; But I will hide the blossom near my heart, That its soft touch, and breath of precious balm May minister kind soothings, for my heart, Is sometimes lone, and very sorrowful, And then it yearns for that kind sympathy Which Friendship only can administer. But I have learn'd that Friendship is a flower So pure, so priceless, so allied to heaven, That it is seldom found in this poor world Of earth, and fire, and ashes. If it spring And promise fair awhile, the mildew blight Of death comes cold upon it, or the pang Of parting wrings the tender stem in twain; Or interest taints it with a baleful blight; Or the blind earth-worm of distrust creeps in And gnaws away its root; or envy strikes Her poison fang into its very heart; Or black detraction eats away the buds, And leaves the rifled tree a crown of thorns; Or this impure and changing atmosphere Causes the fair exotic to put forth The rank wild flowers of passion, which breathe out A venom'd burning odour, which is death To the intoxicated spell-bound soul That wears it in the bosom. Yet I know That this thine offering is pure, for earth Has never touch'd it. Eye, nor voice, nor hand Of weak mortality has soil'd the plant. It sprang and budded in the spirit land, All fair, and sweet, and holy. May it bloom All my life long, to cheer my weary way With holy fragrance of its sympathy, And when my heart shall cease to feel its balm, Then may its blossoms shed-their holy dew Upon my humble grave. And when we meet Where there is no more death, may the choice flower, Transplanted also to its native soil, Burst into heavenly never-fading bloom; And unknown Friends, meet, mingle, and rejoice, In presence of the Ever Living Source Of happiness, and immortality. THE SUSPECTED. Nay, fear me not, beloved; I am here With other thoughts than vengeance. Turn not thus Thy dear face from me. Henry, I am here To soothe and comfort thee, now that thou art Deserted of all else, as if thou wert Indeed, a pestilent and loathsome thing Fit only for corruption, and the worms. (I cannot fear infection; death to me Is all too slow in coming. Oh, that God Would give me thy disease, and let thee live!) Thou now hast need of me. I will remain And serve, and aid thee, and administer All healing medicines; I will bathe thy head With grateful acids, and thy burning hands In pure cold water. I will bring thee food Such as thy state requires, and give thee drink, And sit beside thy pillow all night long To watch thy breath, with spirit gushing forth In tears, and ardent prayers. I will do all That woman's never never weary hand And all-enduring spirit, can perform. When thou shalt be recover'd, I will go Back to my hiding-place. If thou wilt then But smile, and say I thank thee, Isabelâ Those words should lie upon my broken heart A blessed balm leaf; and that precious smile Should live, a glory on my weary nights, A rainbow on the storm-cloud of my life, To each, a beautiful, a sweet relief. Thou art a man, and canst not comprehend The heart of woman, which is like a harp Strung, and attun'd to most exquisite bliss, But which awakes not, till the master hand Of Love is laid upon it. Then her soul Is full of melody, and every pulse That stirs her bosom, is an echoing thrill Of that one tender lay, and if the strain Be bliss or agony, or life or death, It mingles with her soul. Identity By her is quite forgotten; she exists And acts, but for the idol of her love. I will not chide thee, but I must complain: Now, that thou can'st not fly me, I must breathe The story of my love, my worshipping, Which of itself is truth unchangeable. I was a happy girl, careless of heart, And full of music as a warbling bird, Which sings because its soul is melody And floats out on its breathing. Every bliss That young hearts take delight in was my own. Thy voice came to my heart, the breath of life Thrilling its fibres with a living bliss, And pulsing through my frame a tenderness Of which thou wert the soul. Thenceforth I knew No life, apart from thine, no joy, no hope, No happiness, that centred, not in thee. 'Twere vain to say I lov'd thee, for my soul My whole existence was all full of thee, And where thou wert was bliss. I had no aim In life, but to promote thy happiness,â Then I became a woman, and resign'd The pride of girlhood, bowing meekly down To woman's destiny, with glowing heart, Blessing the Wisdom that ordain'd her lot, Her blissful lot, to love and serve the man To whom her heart does homage. Earnestly My kindred warn'd me that I should not wed A haughty and ambitious man, like thee. But what they deem'd thy faults, were in mine eyes High excellencies. That a heart so proud, So stern, so independent of the world, Could worship me, a weak and simple girl, And deem the treasure of my heart a prize Worth suing for, awoke my gratitude, And seem'd a source of pride. For thee, for thee, I threw aside the blessed coronet Of Home's enduring jewels, and put on The bridal ring instead. And I went forth In blissful confidence of happiness, With thee, and only thee.âTo me thou wert The cup of life, brim-full of happiness, And my heart bathing in the blessed flood Ask'd nothing more of heaven. Shall I say on?â Oh Henry! Henry!âWere it possible For language to express the bitterness That came upon my spirit, like the flood To the primeval world, extinguishing Beauty, and life, and spreading o'er the waste, A cold and wiltering shroud. Could'st thou have seen The livid, corses, and the daggled flowers, That lay beneath the deluge of my grief, Thou might'st perhaps have learn'd to understand How desolate a woman's heart can be. Death had been welcome then, for life to me Was but a light within a sepulchre, Showing the death and darkness brooding there. I could have borne thy coldness; could have borne The careless glance, and the indifferent tone, The long protracted absence, and the death Of all my joys in thee. I could have borne Almost to see another in thine arms, But to be doubtedâAh, that thou should'st doubt My love, my truth, my honour! Oh, that God Had stricken me from being, while my heart Was happy in thy love, and confidence! There is not in the phial of Heaven's wrath, In the black chalice of infernal ire, Or in the more ingeniously mix'd draught That human malice pours, a drop so keen, So deadly bitter to a woman's soul, As the suspicion of her purity Utter'd by him she loves. It kills the heart; It wounds the spirit, it destroys the soul! She is suspected. Wherefore should she live? Why cherish virtue? Why be innocent? Oh man belov'd!âCould'st thou but feel the weight That presses like a leaden monument Upon the breast of her thou dost suspect, Thou would'st not lightly taunt her with a crime Including all of guilt, hypocrisy, Falsehood, and baseness, that the human heart Vile as it is, can practise, or conceive. A woman once suspected is undone, Thrown from her confidence in God, and man, For whereforeâwhereforeâshould the innocent Be doom'd to wear the heaviest of all chains, And drink the keenest of all nauseous draughts? There is no peace within her broken heart; No joy, in all the glorious world around. Even the consciousness of innocence, That blessed solace of all other woes, To her heart-sickness is a bitter balm. And when she kneels in prayer, though she lift up The offering of a broken contrite heart; Hands, spotless as an infant's, and sad eyes Wet, with the holy dew of piety, She hears the world hiss forth âThe hypocrite!â And Christianity sigh forth a prayer That sheâthe Magdalenâmay be forgiven. The bitter fountain of her heart is stirr'd, And quenches out devotion's sacred fire. A shadow walks forever at her side, With blackness tinging all her works, and ways. Though as she wanders weeping through the world, She strews her pathway with the holiest gifts Of charity, and good-will unto man, Even those that gather up the precious flowers Suspect a lurking mildew in the leaves And almost fear contagion. Dost thou weep? There is no balsam even in thy tears, To heal my spirit wounds. Not the whole flood Of the vast ocean, and the rain of Heaven, Can e'er efface the record of my shame. Yet I am innocent! And pure of heart As when an infant in my mother's arms. No,âtell me not of hope. To such as me She points but to the grave, and that pure world Beyond its precincts, where the wicked cease From troubling, and the weary are at rest. Oh, speak it not! I cannot live with thee And love thee, and be happy, for my heart Is like a broken vase. 'Tis vain to pour Hope, love, or consolation into it; They cannot heal it, and will trickle forth, Mix'd with the cankering dregs that rankle there, In hot corrosive drops. Oh no! Oh no! Thou'st woundedâit is past thy power to heal And we are both undone. THE HAPPY HOME. There's a stream in Pennsylvania, A wild romantic stream, More musical, and beautiful, Than fancy's wildest dream. 'Tis braided of a thousand strands, The little silver rills, Spun by the Naiads in their joy Amongst the gay green hills. The bright green hills, that proudly wear The crest of Liberty, Where winds, and streams, and singing birds And animals are free. And manâOh! how his soul expands, How free his footsteps are, When out upon the bright green hills, He breathes the morning air. The morning air, that stirs the trees, And wakes the early bird; While in the glens the flowers look up As if the sweet things heard. While rising from his mossy lair The deer goes forth in pride, With quick bright eye, and breezy foot Along the mountain's side. The mountain-side, where deep ravines Betray the heart within, The iron heart, that still bears up Where storm, and time have been. While darkly o'er their rugged brows The giant pine trees wave, Unchang'd, while generations pass From cradle, to the grave.â Amongst these hills the stream I sing, Flows gloriously along, From everlasting hymning forth Its everlasting song. Where round the bases of the hills It bathes their rock-built feet, Its music hath a chiding tone And seems more wild than sweet. But in the green and shadowy vales Oh, soft its anthem swells, And floats like spirit melodies Far up the haunted dells. And oft the trembling waters sleep In valley's fair and bright, As Tempe, where the gods of Greece, Found more than heaven's delight. The waters sleep, and seem to dream For troubled is their rest, And earth, and heaven in broken gleams Are mirror'd in its breast; And softly from the dimpling waves The dreamy murmurs rise, As when from sleeping tenderness Breathe words, half lost in sighs. While sweetly through the listening vale The balmy breezes sweep, And with the voices of the stream, A tender converse keep. Amongst these valleys of delight One most enchanting place, Lies bosom'd in surrounding hills Half lock'd in their embrace. On one side brightly rolls the stream Where cliffs on cliffs ascend, And crags that wear the clouds of heaven Seem o'er its course to bend; And every where, from cleft, and knoll, The blossom'd streamers fair Float out, and shed their fragrant breath Upon the mountain air. And many a mossy shelf is spread As for an elfin feast, With cups, that shame the jewell'd gold On regal tables placed; Bright cups, and urns of every hue, With limpid honey fill'd, Or bending with the nectar drop By nature's self distill'd. And there the fairies of the dell No race by fancy nurst, But emerald coated humming birds Allay their dainty thirst. The fair, the bright, the beautiful, The gentle, soft, and sweet, The august, the magnificent, Here all delight to meet. And there are dwellers in this vale, (And all along the stream, Where'er a valley may be found The scatter'd dwellings gleam.) In years gone by there stood a cot Within that valley fair, With roof so gray, you might have deem'd It had been always there. In front, quite to the water's edge Grew rose and lilac bowers, And gardens lay on either side, Enrich'd with choicest flowers. All round, the little vale was fill'd With agriculture's pride, And bearing orchards climb'd far up The swelling mountain-side. Here dwelt a couple, with their wealth Of sweet content, and peace, And full, confiding, mutual love, The very soul of bliss. There lay no sorrow on their hearts, No shadow on their way, And pleasant toils, and sweet delights Attended every day. Their fertile fields, and decent cot Afforded food and rest, And health-imparting exercise, Gave these the purest zest. They had no cares beyond the hills That fenced their covert home; Each to the other was the world, Why should they wish to roam? One gentle daughter bloom'd alone Within their shelter'd nest, A rose-bud, with the dew of love Lock'd trembling in its breast. Her name was Rhoda, and she grew A rose serenely fair, With all the wealth that nature wins From sun, and living air. The impress of all loveliness Was perfect on her face, Her youthful form was beautiful With every healthy grace. The sun-beams saw her sporting free, And lov'd her auburn hair, And nestling in the silken curls, Lay always smiling there. And those who mark'd the brilliant thoughts Within her dark blue eyes, Might deem they saw the seraphim Deep in the evening skies. And tenderness, and purity, Dwelt ever in her words, That fill'd the heart with melody Like songs of summer birds. And as she plied her sportive toil, Or train'd her fragrant flowers, The gushing music of her heart Gave gladness to the hours. Her parents treasured in their home Within a sacred nook, A few choice tomes of ancient lore, Beside the Holy Book. All these, the noble girl had read, And so her mind was stor'd With pure exalted sentiments, And knowledge of the Lord. And when âOur Fatherâ pass'd her lips In prayer, at morn, and even, She felt a child's strong confidence In Him, who is âin heaven;â Confiding wholly in his love, And trusting to his care, She grew a âlily of the field,â A song âbird of the air.â Her heart toward all living things Oerflow'd with tenderness, And every simple flower might claim, A sister's dear caress. The innocence of infancy Lay in her spirit still, Like dew all day within the cup Of violet by the rill. And girlhood's guileless trust and truth, Like that meek violet's blue, Inbraided with her very life, Their spell around her threw. Full oft her father made his prayer That never to her breast, The knowledge of the false cold world, Should come, to break her rest. For he had known the world too well, With all its crooked ways; Had met the homage paid to wealth, And worn the scholar's bays. And he had prov'd what all have prov'd, Who deem her courts divine; And turn'd in weariness of soul, From her unholy shrine. And with the lady of his love, A high-born maid was she, He sought a dwelling, where the heart Might tell its pulses free. Where wild Ambition's eagle note Could never break his rest; Or Avarice's serpent chain of gold Benumb, and crush the breast. Where fashion should not hold her court Of fancies false and vain, And changeful as the wildest dreams That haunt the maniac's brain. Where in the pleasant ways of life Stern Hauteur should not stand, To crush the buds of human love With her relentless hand. And sweetly o'er his happy home The circling years that sped, Had left no grief marks on his heart, No white hairs on his head. The dwellers all along the stream Far as his name was known, Lov'd, honour'd, and rever'd the man Who made their cause his own; Who had a dole for every want, A balm for every grief, And sympathy for all the ills That might not claim relief. And many a high-bred traveller Who rested in his cot, Paid homage to his noble heart, And envied him his lot. And many a haughty spirit there At Rhoda's feet confess'd, The power of maiden loveliness In unassuming vest. And wonder'd at her gentle words, And soul-entrancing grace; And how so rich a flower had bloom'd, In such a humble place. But mostly at her dignity Of action, voice, and eye, Which might have grac'd the proudest star Of ancient chivalry. And some had said, it cannot be That such a queenly maid, Was born in this sequester'd cot, And nurtur'd in this shade. But when they ask'd her if she felt No restless wish to stray, And taste the homage which the world Would be compell'd to pay? She still replied, I feel no wish To leave this home of love, For out upon the world's cold waste I should be like the dove, That o'er the shoreless weltering flood Sought rest, but sought in vain, Until she came with weary wing Back to the ark again. Oh, no. The world has never given The martyr at her shrine, Such love, such peace, such sweet content, As in this vale are mine. I dwell amongst my sister flowers, And when the spring birds come, I join my merry song with their's, And bid them welcome home. I gather berries on the hills, And when the fawns pass by, I tell them they are scarce more free, More fleet of foot, than I. And I have sketch'd this lovely scene From various points of view, And always find some novel charm, Some feature, rich and new. I cultivate my garden flowers, I train the scented vine, I nurse and rear the useful plant, And teach the beans to twine; The needle, and the merry wheel Are playthings in my hands, And all the housewife's healthy art, My ready skill commands. I never knew a day too long, Or pass'd a sleepless night; Or ope'd a sad or languid eye Upon the morning light. Not one warm feeling of my heart Has ever been conceal'd, Nor have I ever known a wish That might not be reveal'd. But I am told that in the world A veil, to hide the heart, Is deem'd a necessary thing, And worn with nicest art. Ah, wherefore should I wish to win, A homage false and brief, While here I have a world of love That fears no yellow leaf? Then, tempt me notâOh, tempt me not, With restless wing to roam, And search the desert for the flowers, That bloom so fair at home. My pleasant home! my happy home, Beside the joyous stream; I cannot dream in this dear home Ambition's restless dream. Then if they sorrow'd that a flower So delicately fair, So fragrant, and so rich in grace, Should waste its sweetness there. She answer'd, I have often mark'd Amongst my garden bowers, That meddling fingers bruise and stain The most attractive flowers; That admiration, while she bends To taste the rich perfume, Blights with the siroc of her breath The bosom of the bloom. And I have blest the buds that grow By vales, and hills untrod, Unseen, untouch'd by aught beside The sun and wind, of God. The jess'mine on the arid hill Seeks not a happier lot, Kind nature always lays the germ In an appropriate spot. The rose that loves the holy dew, The sun-shine, and the shower, Will never bloom so sweet and fair In artificial bower. Time, who by magic touch transforms All things, beneath the sky, Who never spared the beautiful, Or pass'd the joyous by, Who never yet hath paus'd to hear The heart's most earnest prayer, Or linger'd at the shrieking cry Of agoniz'd despair, Hath pass'd the vale of which I sing With his transforming touch; Its features hardly seem the same It has been chang'd so much. Upon the hills where slept the deer, Beneath the gray old trees, Bright harvests, sporting with the wind Display their mimic seas. And in the dells where hemlocks spread Their still and pall-like shade, And drooping o'er the spring bud's tomb The pure white ghost-flower staid. Where hellebore beside the stream, Grew rank, with many a weed, Are meadows now, and pastures green, Where flocks, and cattle feed. One hill with gently swelling slope Sweeps down toward the tide; And midway on its bosom fair, In chaste and snowy pride, Half veil'd in trees, and blossom'd vines, A cottage front is seen, Like the white bosom of a bird Amid the leavy screen. And there the angels peace, and truth, And love and honour dwell, And heart-warm hymns of gratitude Go up with ceaseless swell. There hospitality delights To spread her grateful store, And every weary pilgrim finds A welcome at the door. There rural elegance, and taste, With cleanliness abide, And wisdom, and intelligence With modesty preside. And this is Rhoda's happy home, Where now a blessed wife, She watches o'er the fair young buds The treasures of her life. And here her parents in their age Claim each an easy chair, And guide her in her pleasant tasks, And bless her pious care. And he, who in his hunter's dress, First taught her heart to love; Who for her sake forgot the world, And every wish to rove. He dwells within a paradise Of pure and tranquil bliss, To which, if sorrow comes at all, She brings no bitterness. RIZPAH. On Gibeah's rock, by the place of the dead, The sackcloth of Rizpah, the mourner, was spread; And all the long day in the sun's fervid glare, That shadow of beauty sat withering there. And all through the night she was watching there still, She saw not its terrors, she felt not its chill; The damp winds were sighing amid the dark hair, That veil'd with its wealth, brow and bosom, most fair. The dew in big drops gather'd over her face, And still she mov'd not from that horrible place, But sat with strain'd eye, and her soul in her ear, The step of the stealthiest invader to hear. The wolf from the thicket glared gloatingly forth, Her eye kept him chain'd, by its spell, to the earth. The foul fierce hyena crept starv'd from his lair, And fled at the shriek of a mother's despair. The eagle scream'd shrill as he stoop'd from the sky, The ravens assembled with clamorous cry, The vultures snuff'd fiercely the blood-tainted air, But Rizpah prevented their banqueting there. Oh God! what a watch for a mother to keep! What return for the heart of a mother to reap; What horrible death to the hopes that run wild, As the fond mother watches her innocent child. And she who this death-watch of agony kept, As haggard and pale as the dead ones she wept, Was beautiful once, as the spirit of spring, And her home of delight was the heart of a king. And when in his palace with transports of joy, She clasp'd to her bosom each royal young boy, And the lord of her heart in his gladness stood by, With pride in his mien, and delight in his eye. Ah, little dream'd she of that proud monarch's doom; The sorrow, the shame, and the darkness to come, That judgment which never forgets, should require The blood of her sons, for the sins of their sire? That she, the beloved, the gay, and the fair, Should keep such long watch, of heart-rending despair? Power, pomp, joy, and beauty, and hope have gone by, But loveâwoman's loveâOh, this never can die.â THE BOQUET. Addressed to my Brother. Dear J?, I've rang'd my garden through, And cropp'd the blooms from various stems And brought a boquet, in my view, Rich as a regal diadem. My flowers are emblematic too, And since you yet may choose a wife, They may impart a hint to you, Of service, all your future life. The Rose is titled queen of flowers, And in her peerless wealth of bloom, She beautifies the summer bowers, And fills them with her rich perfume. Love's emblem, too, the rose is deem'd, Sweet, fair, and brief, with thorns beset, But, brother, all my young heart dream'd Was like this rose, with dew all wet; Brief dreams of beauty, while they staid Wet with a trembling spirit's tears; And one by one, I saw them fade, And leave their thorns for future years. Yet while I wept their transient bloom, I treasur'd every fragment leaf; And now, amid my hours of gloom Their lingering balm beguiles my grief. Dear brother, may your roses prove A wreath of never-fading flowers, But mark me, brotherâdo not love The queenly rose of THORNY bowers. To him who LOVES, no peerless grace, No balm that genius breathes around, Atones for pride's cold heartlessness, Or heals, when thorns of passion wound. I've violets here, of every hue, The native purple, blue, and white, The splendid parti-colour'd too, The yellow, with her golden light;â A gentle family they are, Modest, and sweet, and well belov'd; And calm Content delights to share The violet's bower, from pomp remov'd. Observe this lily, pure as snow, With drooping head, and earthward eye, She seems an angel, lost below; A soul all sensibility. Such pure and intellectual maid, A sweet and faithful friend, may prove, But is not fit with man to wed, To sympathize with human love. I've brought the splendid Peony A thing of regal pomp and pride, She courts the sun, at noon of day, With ardent bosom free and wide; Thou should'st not choose a bride like her, A masculine and dauntless maid; Would not a bosom gentler far, Beat sweeter 'neath a pillow'd head? And here's the Fleur de lis, of France, In purple, blue, and gold, array'd; Its splendour fills the courtier's glance, Its fragrance charms the cottage maid; Just such a flower would wisdom seek, Fair, thornless, sweet, and humble too; A royal thing, though still and meek She bathes her in the forest dew; As rich, as joyous, when she grows Beside the cotter's white-wash'd wall, As when adorning royal brows She blooms, the worshipp'd gem of all. Just such a flower should woman be, Meet jewel for a diadem; Yet, in her cheerful piety, The humblest garden's sweetest gem. THE DREAMING PENITENT. Ah, placid is thy slumber, And peace is on thy brow, Poor ruin'd girl! I fancy That thou art dreaming now. Perchance thou art retracing by memory's vivid powers, The sweet and holy pleasures of childhood's sinless hours. Perchance thou now art roving With sisters glad and fair, To cull the richest blossoms To bind thy sunny hair; While blithe among the branches, the fluttering wild bird sings, And butterflies are fanning the flowers, with spangled wings. Or haply thou art seated By thy fair mother's side, Ah, wo to thee! poor wanderer, That thine own mother died. She would have watched her darling, with fond and ceaseless care, And warn'd thee of the sorrow, and sav'd thee from the snare. Perhaps thou now art listening To fond sweet words of praise Such as she used to lavish Upon thine early days. Such as a mother only can pour upon the ear, And such as thou, poor mourner, art doom'd no more to hear. A smile illumes thy features, A blush is on thy cheek; What dear and pure delusions Do these emotions speak? Perchance the treacherous passion, which wrought thy fearful doom, Now lives on fancy's scenery, in all its joy-bright bloom. Perchance soft words are stealing Thy trembling nerves along, And thrilling through thy spirit Like some false syren's song, Which woos the list'ning sailor to some bright islet's shore, Till in the treacherous whirlpool he sinks for evermore. Oh, could'st thou sleep thy life out In these fair dreams of love, Of truth, and bliss unfading, Like that which lives above!â Ah, now thy breast is heaving, with deep and painful sighs, And tears gush through the fringes, that close thy sleeping eyes. The tears of guilt are bitter, And Oh, they are in vain! They cannot heal the spirit Or cleanse the bosom's stain; But penitence will lead thee, where living waters flow, And trees of life eternal, with leaves of healing grow. THE DYING BOY. To die! Oh, it seems sad, While yet the light of youth is in mine eye, And all the world so beautifulâso gladâ 'Tis sad to die. I love to see the sun Sail upward, on a flood of dazzling light,â Or like a victor, on his pennons, won, Lie down at night I love the moonlight nights, When light clouds hover on the living breeze; And stars are gleaming, like the sailor's lights, On shoreless seas. I love to see the shower On fleecy pillows sleeping, low and still, As if its bed were spread amongst the bowers Of yon green hill. 'Till rising in its strength, Its dusky wings athwart the heavens it throws, So like an eagle rising in his strength From long repose. Then comes the quivering flash Of his keen eye, and then his voice burst forth In dread low murmurs, or the pealing crash That rocks the earth. I love the startling shock! The forests bend beneath his glorious voice; The iron bases of the mountains rock; The floods rejoice. I love the genial earth When timid flowers are peeping from her breast, And song-birds come with their melodious mirth, Each to its nest. And when the summer hours Dry the mown grass, and bleach the rustling grain, Spread rich ripe berries, and delicious flowers, O'er hill and plain; When generous autumn flings Her rich ripe treasures 'mongst the foliage sear; And agriculture to the granary brings The yellow ear.â In winter-wind and storm, And ice, and snow-drift; and high blazing hearthâ In every seasonâevery varied formâ I love the earth. And oh! I love the smile That lives for me, in many a gentle eye,â While fresh hearts love, and young hands cling the while, 'Tis hard to die. Alas my glorious dreams! Where is the scholar's laurel chaplet now? Where now the diadem, with glory beams For Genius' brow? Already were my feet Fix'd on the steeps of Science, and mine eyes Turn'd to her temple, while my bosom beat To grasp the prize. Where are my dreams of wealth, Long life, and honour, power, and usefulness? Alas, this fell disease with fatal stealth, Mocks all my bliss. O'er all life's glorious dreams Despair has spread her black and chilling pall. Love, mirth, and pleasure! All your honeyed streams Are chang'd to gall. Come, mother! sooth me now, My rest and weary spirit leans on thee; Oh, place thy hand once more upon my brow, And comfort me. Speak kindly in mine ear As thou wert wont, when aught disturb'd my joy. Oh come! and with thine angel presence cheer Thy dying boy. Tell me again of heaven As thou would'st tell me in mine infancy; Mother! The bright things of the world, have driven Thy words away. But tell me now again Of that bright world, where death can never come; And whisper to me how I may attain That blessed home. Kneel down by me, and prayâ The Lord will hear thee for thy dying boy.â Oh, let me pass from thine embrace, away To endless joy. âI LOVE.â Oh! do not speak it lightly! That little word, I love, Thou dost not know how stern a thing One simple word may prove; It is the word of Destinyâ The seal of woman's fate; And utter'd once, regret and tears, May comeâbut come too late. He unto whom thou breathest That little thrilling word, Becomes at once thine arbiter, And knows himself thy lord; His foot is on thy sceptre, His law is on thy soul, And o'er thy spirit evermore The tide of his shall roll. Thenceforth his every heart-pang Shall quiver through thy breast; And on thy soul, and on thy fame, The shade of his shall rest. Then do not utter lightly That word of FateâI love! Thou dost not know how stern a thing That little word may prove. THE DEAD! THE DEAD! The dead! the dead! the buried out of sight! Why are they ever present to the heart! For ever mirror'd in the holy night, Of all its phantom pageantry a part. For ever present through the busy day, Inseparable from the passing hours; While from all pleasant things, their memory Is breathing like the incense from the flowers. Oh, my beloved Dead! though far away The grave-grass grows above thy silent breast, Though on that spot I may not kneel, or lay One tear-wet leaf, above thy place of rest; Though years have pass'd, since on the clasping vines Of our affections, sorrow's mildew fell, With'ring away thy branch, and blighting mineâ (If it had died, perchance it had been well. For oh, how darkly on the breast, and brow The shadow of that ruin'd garland lies, With drooping buds that ne'er can open now, With dew of heart-wept tears, and breath of sighs.) Why art thou ever with me? my lost love! Why do all objects cast a shade of thee? Cannot the heavy earth that lies above Shut in thy form,âor hide thy face from me? Cannot the curtain of the spirit land With its dim mystery, veil thy perfect mind? That ever in my path I see thee stand, And feel thy spirit with mine own entwin'd? I see thee in all beautyâand thy voice Is in all musicâthou art every where;â Where Friendship smilesâwhere mutual loves rejoice, Where'er farewell! is spoken, thou art there! And in its early, chosen place of rest, Thy cold heart liesâfor ever press'd to mine, I feel it always thereâI cannot restâ Mine throbs,âbut there is no reply of thine. The dead! The dead!âWhy are they with us thus, If death has power to sever human ties? To shut our lov'd and beautiful, from us, Or break affection's braided sympathies?â It is not so! Love mingles into one The perfect being of each wedded pair; With bonds that cannot be on earth undone And knitted once in heavenâare perfect there. THE LOST ONE. She was a lovely childâupon her face Lay beautyâwith that ever-varying grace Which charms, and fixes the beholder's gaze; And you might trace in her clear, loving eye, Each girlish feeling in its purity, As in pure water 'neath an azure sky, You see the bright-wing'd birds that flutter by. Fine threads of feeling, delicately twin'd, Compos'd the tissue of her perfect mind, With broider'd flowers by fancy's hand design'd. Her spirit was a wind harp, with its flow Of magic tones, all musically low, Wak'd by the softest zephyr that can blow, Blending with all the pure, and sweet below, Still stealing through the heart unconsciously, And moving every chord of melody, To its own sweetly plaintive witchery. Her every step was music, wild and free As summer evening's breezy minstrelsy, Which walks amongst all sweet things in its glee, And touches every creature, lightsomely. She seem'd a being, not of mortal birth; She felt no sympathy with things of earth, Its goldâits honoursâor its noisy mirth. She could not brook its hypocritic art, Or court applause amid its busy mart; She seem'd like light, a holy thing apart, Yet mingling with all joy, in every heart. And those who met her oft at summer even, Might deem that to her purity 'twas given To hold communion with the stars of heaven; For then she seem'd as of ethereal clay, All animate with love's divinest ray, And trembling with one wish to pass away With the soft radiance of departing day. For then her pure young spirit caught such gleams,â Such thrilling pageantry of broken dreams, Of heaven's own perfect forms, in glory beams. She knew there was a world of perfect bliss, Above the cares, and vanities of this, Where all the soul is fill'd with happiness, And folds its wings in ever-during peace. And sometimes in those visionary hours, She seem'd so near the angel radiant bow'rs, She almost felt the perfume of the flowers. And then a troubled rapture stirr'd her breastâ A sweetly painful yearning to be blest,â A longing for some blessing unexpress'dâ To fill the heart, which had not found its rest. She lov'dâher heart was fill'dâher shadowy dreams, Were realiz'dâwith all their glory beams, Their never-fading flowers, and living streams. She lov'dâKnow'st thou how such a one can love?â She was all tendernessâlike the young dove, Ardent and pure, as seraphim aboveâ And guiltless of a thought, that hearts can rove. Know'st thou the trembling raptureâwhen at first From the full heart the thrilling waters burst, The stream for which her soul had been athirst? Know'st thou the sense of sweet ecstatic rest, With which she nestled to the chosen breast? Like some wild bird, which, having found her nest, Folds her bright wings, even for a song too blest. Then thou may'st judge how fearful was her fate, When all too earlyâand yet all too late, She found herself deceiv'd, and desolate. Oh! WOMAN'S LOVE! To man divinely given, His purest, sweetest treasure this side heavenâ Oh, God! that from his heart it should be riven, And naked forth upon the cold world driven. And she is lost! a craz'd and restless thing,â A fair bark, shatter'd by the storm-god's wingâ A tempest-broken flower of early spring. Still shadowy dreams pursue her every where, But hope's bright form no more is mirror'd thereâ But from the ruins of the past, despair Brings darken'd shreds of all that once was fair. TO AN ÃOLEAN. Thou'rt like my heartâthou shivering string Of wild and plaintive tone; Thrill'd by the slightest zephyr's wing, That over thee is thrown. Replying with melodious wail To every passing sigh; And pouring to the fitful gale Wild bursts of harmony. Still, by the tempest's torturing power Thy loftiest notes are rung, And in the stormy midnight hour, Thy holiest hymns are sung. Thou'rt like my heart, thou trembling string That lov'st the gentle breeze,â Yet yieldest to the tempest king Thy loftiest melodies. TO THE PINEâON THE MOUNTAIN. Thou giant Pineâof patriarchal years, O'er the rock helmet of the mountain bending, As watching you glad river, which appears Like a bright dream, through worlds of beauty wending, Mocking thy bleak and solitary pride, With warm and flow'ry scenes, and soft wings gleaming, Bright fountains smiling on the green hill-side, 'Neath bowers of blossom'd vines, profusely streaming. And sigh'st thou o'er those visions of delight, As my lone bosom, o'er the glowing treasures Which live in fancy's realm, before my sight And mock my spirit, with ideal pleasures? Or art thou holding converse with the wind, Waving majestic assent to some story, Of mournful interest, how thy stately kind Have perish'd from the places of their glory. Or are ye talking of the noble race Stately as thou, with the wind's freedom roaming, Who o'er these mountains once pursued the chase, And stemm'd the river, with the spring flood foaming. Oh, knew I all the legends of the past, With life, and love, and death, and sorrow teeming, On which thou hast look'd down, since first the blast Play'd with thy plumes, in morning sunlight gleaming. Thou'st seen the free-born hunters of the wild, Chasing the fleet deer, in his antler'd glory; Or with his chosen maid, rich nature's child, Breathing in whispers love's ungarnish'd story. And thou hast seen him on the mountain path, Victor, and vanquish'd; fleeing, and pursuing; Conquer'd, and writhing with vindictive wrath; Or agonizing o'er his country's ruin. While the fierce conqueror gaz'd with gloating eye On mangled forms, in mortal anguish lying; Or where the weekwam's flame was wreathing high, Lighting dark forms, with frantic terror flying: Seem'd he not king-like, with his plumy crown; And like a tiger, streak'd with hideous painting; With hand that sought no treasure but renown, And heart that knew no fear, and felt no fainting? Full many a time, perchance, beneath thy shade The youthful sachem stood, with pride surveying His wide dominion, and the balmy shade Of the soft valley, where his love was straying, And sometimes still there comes a wasted form With locks like thine, by many winters faded; Well has he braved the battle and the storm, The sachem whom thy youthful branches shaded. Ye are a noble pair, ye stand the last, Each, of a noble race; and ye are staying, Magnificent mementoes of the past, Glorious and wonderful in your decaying. And thou dost toss thy branches to the wind, And sigh sad dirges of thy perish'd glory, And he is brooding with a darken'd mind Over a perished nation's wrongful story. A few more yearsâthe bird of mightiest wing Shall seek his long-loved rest, with mournful screamingâ A few more years, and no dark form shall cling To this stern height, of perish'd glory dreaming. Ah! who will mourn, when thou art lying low, And o'er the shatter'd trunk green mosses creeping? What noble heart will swell with generous wo When the last warrior of his race is sleeping?â TO THE FIRST SPRING FLOWER. Sweet bud of happiness and hope Young daughter of the spring; How timidly thy soft leaves ope, While o'er thy head fond zephyrs droop The warm and dewy wing. Too early, little azure flower, Thy fragile bloom is spread, For winter yet, with lingering power, Will heap his snow and icy shower, Upon thy beauteous head. How joyously thou'rt looking up Toward the sunbright sky, As with a timid smile of hopeâ With incense in thy little cup, And tears in thy blue eye. Ah me! Mine eyes are filling too With tears unlike to thine. Thine eye is gemm'd with holy dewâ But bitter drops of earth-born wo Swell painfully in mine. To me thy leaves are written o'er With mem'ries of sweet hours, In which my little heart ran o'er With bliss, which can return no more With spring's returning flowers. When I knelt down upon the sod With unalloy'd delight, And fondly kiss'd the early bud, And offer'd simple thanks to God For gifts so sweet, and bright. My spirit then was like to thee, No storm had o'er it blown, And from its holy treasury, Young hopes and loves were joyously, On passing zephyrs thrown. My dreams were full of romance then, Of everliving truth, Of love unting'd by mortal stain, Of years of bliss uncross'd by pain, Of age as bright as youth; Of blessings, which the good must gain, Crowns that the great must wear; Of laurels none need seek in vain, Of bright rewards for every pain, And gold, for toil, and care. My hopes were like thee, April flower, They budded all too soon, And when the cold relentless shower Arose, they bent beneath its power, Crush'd, wither'd, and undone. Yet o'er the now deserted spot Fond memory loves to weep, Where spring flowers bloom'd, which now are not, And hopes that cannot be forgot, In precious ruin sleep. THE LEPER. Theresa. Oh, Night! Thy pinions lie so heavily; Upon the anxious brow that seeks in vain The soothing unction of thy sister sleep. Thy shadows take such wild and fearful forms, And throng th' excited mind with phantasies, That agonize the spirit as it turns From one fantastic shape of agony, Only to meet a more horrific shade, And writhe in torture, till the locks that lay In beauty o'er the brow, hang heavily, Wet with the dew that agony wrings out Upon the throbbing temples. Then the breath Is painfully pent up within the lungs, And the swollen heart's slow beats are audible, As strains the ear to catch the first dear sound Of an approaching footstep, which comes not All through the weary night. Oh, I have watch'd And listen'd, till my heart, and ear, and brain Are wrung almost to madness, Thou, dear lord, Of my whole soul and person, who dost sway With love's all potent sceptre every wish, And hope of this poor heart! Oh, where art thou? Why dost thou stay so very long away? Some evil surely has befallen thee. I have observed of late upon thy brow The shadow of some evil destiny: Which dims the sun-light of thy loving eyes, Which dwell upon me with such long strange gaze Of tenderness and sorrow. Oh, I fear! I know not what, or wherefore. But thy stay Is unaccountable. And yet, perchance, The elders of our people, who accord To thy young spirit their sage fellowship, Detain thee in the temple of our God: I know thou dost not tarry willingly, So many weary days beyond the hour Appointed for our meeting. Hush, poor heart! Say not that many a fond, confiding wife, Has felt the spirit-crushing agony Of causeless cold desertion. Oh, my God! Whate'er affliction it may be thy will To lay upon my bruis'd and humbled heart, Spare me this keenest agony of all. Hark! 'Tis his footstep. Oh, I could kneel down And beg his pardon for the hasty thought That could impeach his honour. Jared! Love! Jared. Nay, touch me not, Theresa. Oh, great God! 'Tis now I suffer the full bitterness Of my most dreadful doom. No, never more Shall I embrace thee, dearest. Never more Shall thy fond heart throb bliss into my own, Till my soul reels, delirious with delight. Thou shalt repose within my arms no more, And sleep with thy bright cheek against my breast; Thy pillow will be lone, and wet with tears, And thy heart widow'd, while thy husband lives, And loves, and longs to clasp the gentle form, That God made all his own. Look here, my love. If thou art not quite petrified to stone. Oh, may the strength of Israel's mighty God Support thee through this trial. Look, poor wife, Here is the loathsome plague-spot on mine arm; Death has affixed his certain signet here. I am a leper; fearfully unclean; An outcast; from thy bosom, from my house, My people; from the temple of my God; From love and sympathy. The holy priest Hath said it. Leprous! and incurable. I go forth full of anguish, and disease, To suffer through long years a living death, While my infected flesh is perishing From off a hideous living skeleton, A foul abhorrent thing, whose slightest touch Is rife with death, whose breath is pestilence, Whose constant cry unclean! shall warn away Every approaching foot-step. Oh, Lord God! What is my sin, that thou hast laid on me This most revolting of all punishments, This direst of all sorrows, plagues, and deaths? Oh, weep not thus, dear love.âAnd yet, thy tears, The bitter agony that tortures there Thy young fond bosom, is to me a pledge Of thy fond love and pity. Fare thee well, And do not waste thy life in grief for me. Think of me as I am, a loathsome thing Which none can bear to look on, whose slight touch Is terrible contagion. Be thou blest With health, and friendship. All this wealth is thine I leave it all to thee. My daily bread, And homely garments for my withering form Is all I now require. Theresa. Jared! Oh God!â I cannot hear thee speak such dreadful words, I will not let thee go. My heartâmy heart! 'Tis breaking with fierce anguish. Must it be? Is there no hopeâno mercy with the Lord, That we must part so soon? We, who have lov'd So long, so ferventlyâWe, who have borne Such cruel trials, and endur'd so much.â Is this the meed of our tried faithfulness? This parting, worse a hundred times than death. Jared. Be patient, love. Do not arraign the Lord. I still believe him just, and merciful. What merit could our love have in his eyes? Perchance that very passion is a sin For which he will chastise us. Oh, I feel That I have lov'd thee to idolatry, And madly love thee still.âNay, come not near, I do command thee! Oh, for one embrace!â Might I but clasp thee to my heart once more, And then lie down and die. Death were most sweet To him who lives a moving pestilence, Whose foot-print is pollution to the earth, From whom the vilest wretch shrinks back aghast With terror and abhorrence. Now farewell.â Theresa. âNo, no! I cannot, will not, let thee go! I will go with thee; happier far to share The horrors of the outcast leper's fate, Than, though the world were mine, apart from thee. How can I live within thy princely halls, And lay me down and sleep, in that alcove, On downy pillows 'neath embroider'd silk, The golden fringe of which lies heavily Upon the marble pavement; while I know That thou art outcast, perishing, perchance, On the bare earth, unshelter'd and alone, With none to aid or sooth thee. I will go And share thy sufferings. Jared. It may not be. Thy pangs would add to mine, a thousand fold. Could I endure to see thy fair young form Made horrible by this white pestilence? No.âLet me have, amid my sufferings, One consolation when I think of thee, And deem thee crown'd with blessings. Dost thou faint? Mine arm may not sustain thee, fair young flower, How beauteous is thy drooping loveliness. Now while thine eyes are clos'd, and thy rich voice No longer chains my spirit, I will go. Farewell, farewell for ever. Jared. Oh praise the Lord, Theresa! Praise the Lord, For he hath heal'd thy leper. Oh, the bliss Of this embrace; this sunrise o'er the night Of our long, deep despair. The blessedness Of such a waking from the hideous dream Of misery such as ours. Bless thee, my wife, For thy fond love, and holy constancy To the poor outcast. Heaven reward thy truth; I have not words to thank thee. Theresa. Speak not thus, My love, my rescued treasure. Thank not me. To God the merciful, belongs all thanksâ And the physician whom he sent to thee, He merits at our hands a rich reward. When was the leper ever cleans'd till now? Indeed I fear this bliss is all a dream, Or thou a wretch imposing on my love In my lost husband's name. Forgive the word, I see, I am convinced. But where is he To whom we owe so much? What can we give That will express our gratitude, for all That he has done for us. What shall we give? Jared. Our hearts Theresa, we will give our hearts. The man that heal'd me, is the Nazarene Abhorr'd by our proud rulers, and chief priests, Whose followers are expell'd the synagogues, And hated by our nation. Yet I know That he is the Messiah that should come Of David's royal lineage, and reign A glorious king for ever. To the wild In which I sought to hide my wretchedness, From scorn, and heartless pity, came the fame Of this all-healing Jesus; and I felt That he had power to save me, and went forth Trembling with hope, to seek him. Oh! my wife. Could'st thou but look upon him. Beautiful He is, beyond description. Tall and fair, With dark-brown locks, parted from his clear brow Smooth o'er the perfect temples, waving thence In curls of perfect beauty; and his eyes So clear, so powerful, and full of love, So rich in their expression, when they dwelt In kind compassion on the suffering poor; Or turn, with pride-subduing stern reproof On stubborn sin, and haughty arrogance. I look'd upon him, and my very soul Seem'd gushing forth to meet him, as he mov'd In native majesty, serenely great; Amid the servile multitudes that prest And knelt to kiss his garment. I advanced,â The crowd gave way, they would not touch a form Of pestilence like mine. Low at his feet I knelt, and humbly supplicated, Lord, If thou art willing, thou can'st make me clean. He looked upon me with such pitying love, And reaching forth his hand (oh, what a hand And arm is his) he touch'd me, and replied, I will. Be clean. Oh, how that touch divine, And voice omnipotent, thrill'd through my soul, In swelling rapture rushing to my heart, And trembling through my veins, while all my flesh Was chang'd to health, and beauty. Oh, the bliss! The thrilling life-renewing ecstacy Of that ecstatic moment; when my soul And mortal body, were renew'd and chang'd, By the pure influence of Almighty love. I felt at once that our Immanuel, God, shrined in manhood, had perform'd my cure,â But as I worshipp'd him, he bade me go, Nor speak of Him, but offer to the priest The accustom'd gift.âIn this I will obey, But speak of him I must, for all my soul Is flooded with his love. Earth never bore The impress of a foot perfect as his, Who walks from place to place, a homeless one, Dispensing blessedness in all his ways. His matchless hands impart the richest gifts; Health to the sick; youth's vigour to the lame; Speech to the dumb; and hearing to the deaf; Sight to the blind; and reason's priceless light To lunatics, and fierce demoniacs.â Oh, could'st thou see him stand, serenely calm, Amid the rolling billows of the crowd, That press around him, while some trembling wretch Is struggling through the throng, to reach his feet, Where, as he bends, mute expectation holds Her empire, o'er the expectant living flood. A murmur, like the converse of the waves, First stirs the concourse; then a mighty shout Swells up to heaven, and melts in echoes down Upon the distant hills. The afflicted one Is heal'd, and leaps for joy. But Jesus stands With pure hands clasp'd, and eyes uprais'd to heaven, With sweet expression of deep gratitude And holy love, oft beaming out through tears.â He looks as if his heart had room for all Who need his pity; while his ardent soul Is mingled in communion with the God, Whose power he surely wields. Nay, start not, love, He certainly does wield the power of God, And wield it like a God. He walks the earth, As if he needed naught of all her wealth, And heeded not her honours. Her rewards! Oh, what were all her splendours, gold, and gems, To barter for his gifts to me alone? What were they unto him who holds the keys Of heaven's rich treasury, and dispenses thence Blessings beyond all price. Requiring naught, Not even the tribute of a grateful heart. While precepts such as man ne'er taught to man, Pure as the dew, and searching as the light, Flow from his lips, like incense from the rose That lives on Sharon's mountain. Like our God's, His gifts are great, and free; and all his words Are full of Godlike strength, and purity. With Godlike power he triumphs o'er the pains And spirits, of the deep abyss of death. He is the power, and majesty of God, Enshrin'd in the most pure and faultless form That nature ever shap'd. He will not die As other mortals die, for he has power O'er death and all diseases. At his word, The fiercest demons let their victims go, And shrinking from the splendours of his eye, Crouch down into black darkness. He controls Even the elements; the raging sea Is still at his command, and fierce, free winds, Close their strong pinions, and with murmur'd hymns Sink into sleep upon the rocking flood. Can he not quell the fiercest wrath of man, Or paralyze his limbs, or strike him down To death and dark perdition? If he yields To the cold sceptre of mortality, He must resign himself, a sacrifice, A free-will offering for some great intent; To make atonement at the bar of God For some tremendous evil. He would be A spotless sacrifice, and might atone For a whole world of sin. But words are vain, His power has healed my flesh, and fill'd my soul With gratitude, and love, and holy peace. Theresa, thou shalt see his perfect face, And listen to his voice, and see his deeds; And kneel, and worship our Immanuel. THE END.</field>
