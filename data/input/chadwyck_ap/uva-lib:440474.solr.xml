The following poem is scored for music in the source text. [1] What must a Fairy's dream be, Who drinks of the morning dew? Would she think to fly till she reach'd the sky And bathe in its lakes of blue Or gather bright pearls from the depths of the seaâ What must the dream of a fairy be? [2] What must a Fairy's dream be, Who sleeps when the Mermaid sings? Would she rob the night of her jewels bright, To spangle her silv'ry wings? Rock'd on the wind 'bove the land and the sea, What can the dream of a Fairy be? [3] What must a Fairy's dream be When storms in their anger cry? Would she madly chase in the winds embrace, The lightning gleaming by, Or seize on its flash with a child-like glee, What must the dream of a Fairy be? 4 What must a Fairy's dream be When mid-summer breezes play? Would she proudly sail on the perfum'd gale To welcome the dawn of day? I know that her visions are sportive and free.â What must the dream of a Fairy be? Where Is Thy Spirit Mary? The following poem is scored for music in the source text. Where is thy spirit, Mary? Dwells it in the air? Friends thou hast forsaken Fondly deem 'tis ling'ring there. I heard an old time ballad, Low and plaintive was the strain So pure and clear, I seem'd to hear Thy gentle voice again. She who sang was lovely, She was innocent and fair And I said, if angels guard us, Thy sweet spirit lingers there. Where is thy spirit, Mary? Watching while we sleep? Dost weep for those who wept for thee? Do angels ever weep? The autumn leaf had wilted Ere thou hadst lost thy bloom. But when that leaf had left its stem It settled on thy tomb. Spring birds now returning With their music fill the air, And we know by that sweet warning That thy spirit lingers there. UNCLE NED. The following poem is scored for music in the source text. [1] Dere was an old Nigga, dey call'd him Uncle Ned He's dead long ago, long ago! He had no wool on de top ob his head De place whar de wool ought to grow. Den lay down de shubble and de hoe CHORUS. Hang up the fiddle and de bow: No more hard work for poor Old Nedâ He's gone whar de good Niggas go. [2] His fingers where long like de cane in de brake, He had no eyes for to see;â He had no teeth for to eat de corn cake So he had to let de corn cake be. Den lay down de shubble and de hoe [3] When Old Ned die Massa take it mighty bad, De tears run down like de rain; Old Missus turn pale, and she gets berry sad Cayse she see nebber see Old Ned again. Den lay down de shubble and de hoe STAY SUMMER BREATH. The following poem is scored for music in the source text. Summer breath, Summer breath, whispring low, Wand'ring in darkness, where would'st thou go? Wilt thou not linger and perfume the night, With the fragrance thou'st gather'd in regions of light? Dost sigh for the rose, would'st thou visit her bower, Or sport with the mist till the coming of day; Or art thou seeking some modest wild flower, Whose beauty is gone with the sun's parting ray. Summer breath, Summer breath, woo not the rose, There lies the dew drop in blissful repose, Nestling together, they know not of death; Would'st waft them a sunder? Stay summer breath. Stay for the vapours above yonder fountain, Will shun thy caresses they love not the air. And all the wild flowers that bloom on the mountain, Will shrink from thy kiss Summer breath, go not there!

[1] I dream of Jeanie with the light brown hair, Borne, like a vapor, on the summer air; I see her tripping where the bright streams play, Happy as the daisies that dance on her way. Many were the wild notes her merry voice would pour. Many were the blithe birds that warbled them o'er: Oh! I dream of Jeanie with the light brown hair, Floating, like a vapor, on the soft summer air. [2] I long for Jeanie with the day dawn smile, Radiant in gladness, warm with winning guile; I hear her melodies, like joys gone by, Sighing round my heart o'er the fond hopes that die: Sighing like the night wind and sobbing like the rain,â Wailing for the lost one that comes not again: Oh! I long for Jeanie, and my heart bows low, Never more to find her where the bright waters flow. [3] I sigh for Jeanie, but her light form strayed Far from the fond hearts round her native glade; Her smiles have vanished and her sweet songs flown, Flitting like the dreams that have cheered us and gone. Now the nodding wild flowers may wither on the shore While her gentle fingers will cull them no more: Oh! I sigh for Jeanie with the light brown hair, Floating, like a vapor, on the soft summer air.

[1] The village bells are ringing, And merrily they chime; The village choir is singing, For 'tis a happy time; The chapel walls are laden With garlands rich and gay, To greet the village maiden Upon her wedding day. [2] But summer joys have faded And summer hopes have flown; Her brow with grief is shaded, Her happy smiles are gone; Yet why her heart is laden, Not one, alas! can say, Who saw the village maiden Upon her wedding day. [3] The village bells are ringing, But hark, how sad and slow; The village choir is singing A requiem soft and low; And all with sorrow laden Their tearful tribute pay Who saw the village maiden Upon her wedding day. COMRADES FILL NO GLASS FOR ME. The following poem is scored for music in the source text. [1] Oh! comrades, fill no glass for me To drown my soul in liquid flame, For if I drank, the toast should beâ To blighted fortune, health and fame. Yet, though I long to quell the strife, That passion holds against my life, Still, boon companions may ye be, But comrades, fill no glass for me. 2 I know a breast that once was light Whose patient sufferings need my care, I know a hearth that once was bright, But drooping hopes have nestled there. Then while the tear drops nightly steal From wounded hearts that I should heal, Though boon companions ye may beâ Oh! comrades, fill no glass for me. 3 When I was young I felt the tide Of aspirations undefiled, But manhood's years have wronged the pride My parents centered in their child. Then, by a mother's sacred tear, By all that memory should revere, Though boon companions ye may beâ Oh! comrades, fill no glass for me.</field>

Chorus I SEE HER STILL IN MY DREAMS. The following poem is scored for music in the source text. [1] While the flow'rs bloom in gladness and spring birds rejoice There's a void in our household of one gentle voice. The form of a loved one hath passed from the light, But the sound of her foot fall returns with the night; For I see her still in my dreams, I see her still in my dreams, Though her smiles have departed from the meadows and the streams. [2] Though her voice once familiar hath gone from the day And her smiles from the sunlight have faded away, Though I wake to a scene now deserted and bleak, In my visions I find the lost form that I seek; For I see her still in my dreams, I see her still in my dreams, Though her smiles have departed from the meadows and the streams. LULA IS GONE The following poem is scored for music in the source text. [1] With a heart forsaken I wander In silence, in grief and alone, On a form departed I ponder, For Lula, sweet Lula is gone. Gone when the roses have faded, Gone when the meadows are bare To a land by orange blossoms shaded Where summer ever lingers on the air. CHORUS. Lula, Lula, Lula is gone; With summer birds her bright smiles To sunny lands have flown. When day breaketh gladly My heart waketh sadly, For Lula, Lula is gone. [2] Not a voice awakens the mountains, No gladness returns with the dawn, Not a smile is mirrored in the fountains, For Lula, sweet Lula is gone. Day is bereft of its pleasures, Night of its beautiful dreams, While the dirge of well remembered measures Is murmured by the ripple on the streams. Chorus. [3] When I view the chill-blighted bowers And roam o'er the snow covered plain How I long for spring's budding flowers To welcome her sweet smiles again. Why does the earth seem forsaken? Time will this sadness remove: At her voice the meadows will awaken To verdure, sweet melody and love. Chorus. LINGER IN BLISSFUL REPOSE The following poem is scored for music in the source text.

Softly the night winds are heard, Sighing o'er mountain and dale, love, Gently the vapors are stirred Down in the shadowy vale love. While o'er the dew covered plain, Starlight in silence is gleaming, Lightly I'll breathe a refrain Round the young heart that is dreaming. Dreaming, dreaming, unfettered by the day, In melody, in melody I'll breathe I'll breathe my soul away. WHERE HAS LULA GONE The following poem is scored for music in the source text. [1] Little voices laughing free, Laughing on the lawn, Tell me can you answer me, Where has Lula gone? Where is that merry form Ever on the move, Glancing through calm and storm Living beams of love? Soft rays of mellow light From her eyes were thrown, And her smiles were summer bright, Where has Lula gone? [2] She has left the sunny hills In their blushing bloom, She has left the running rills Gushing round her home, Far in some distant land She may yet be seen Leading a fairy band Like a fairy queen. Far, far my longing heart On her path has flown, Yet no answer can impart; Where has Lula gone? [3] Summer days have come and gone, Starry nights have passed, Many dreams of hope have flown Since I saw her last Roaming in rapture wild On the mountain side, Smiling when roses smiled, Sighing when they died, Wild as the honey bee, Gentle as the fawn, Fairer than the dawn was she; Where has Lula gone? MY LOVED ONE AND MY OWN OR EVA The following poem is scored for music in the source text. [1] Bloom bright fair flowers around the white stone Where sleepeth my Eva, my loved one and my own, Who departed in sadness and left me alone, Sweet Eva, my loved one my own.

The days are gone, days of summer bright and gay, The days of love we so fondly whiled away; But still while I'm dreaming Thy smiles are o'er me beaming, Gentle queen of my song The wind o'er the lone meadow wails for thee, The birds sing thy beauties all day long; Pride of my early years, Thou art the queen of my song. III. I turn to thee; though our happy hours have flown? I turn to thee; and my saddest thoughts are gone, For love will be burning And memory still returning, Gentle queen of my song.

The birds are singing in the air, And the flow'rs in their bloom; All things around are beautiful and fair, But still my spirit lies in gloom. CHORUS.

While she moved among the living Were the days all bright and fair? Did she dwell in happy sunlight Or in dark clouds of care? Was she beautiful like thee, With thy voice of melody? Did she love and cherish me? Oh! tell me of my mother! Gentle lady, let me know,â While she journeyed here below, Was the world her friend or foe?â Oh! tell me of my mother! 2. Tell me, tell me, of my mother! Is she roaming in the skies? I've been dreaming all about her, And awoke with tearful eyes: She was bending o'er my pillow In a deep and earnest prayer, And her voice was like the breathing Of the soft summer air. Is the world so full of pain That she will not come again, Like a sunbeam on the rain? Oh! tell me of my mother! Does she know I'm here alone While my early friends have gone And my dearest memories flown?â Oh! tell me of my mother! FAREWELL MOTHER DEAR.

We will meet again I know; Be not weeping and down hearted. 2. Weep not mother dear for me When I'm laid underneath the willow; I'll keep guard upon thy soul: Thou hast guarded o'er my pillow.

Happy as the live long day was she, And flowing was her dark glossy hair, We will hear no more her winning melody, For we've parted with our little Belle Blair. 2.

[2] We made our little huts on the shore, Nell and I, And covered them with bright colored shells, We gathered moss and fern from the moor, Nell and I, And pluck'd the dewy flowers from the dells. But the days roll'd round And the rude world frown'd, As time with its hitter cares fled on, We left our little huts on the shore, Nell and I, And we left our brightest hopes in their dawn. 3 We wandered by the bright running streams, Nell and I, And gamboled o'er the wide grassy lawn, We met again in light sportive dreams, Nell and I, When the weary hours of twilight had flown. And our hearts proved true 'Till a coldness grew, 'Twas caused by some unrelenting foe, We'll roam upon the lawn never more, Nell and I, Nor wander where the bright rivers flow. âA PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS!â BALLAD. The following poem is scored for music in the source text. I. A penny for your thoughts! For I know that you are dreaming;: Love's little, wicked darts are sporting with your brain; A penny for your thoughts! Thro' those eyes your heart is gleaming, Longing to welcome back the starry night again. O'er the meadows, thro' the dew You'll wander then with I know who, Fair are her wavy locks as vapors on the hill; A penny for your thoughts! On thy lips a smile is beaming, You'r sighing now for Jenny Dow, that lives beyond the mill. II. A penny for your thoughts! Do you think that you will love her When all those burning dreams have flitted from your heart? A penny for your thoughts! Will a halo beam above her, When those delusive hopes and visions bright depart? Will all blessings then as now, Seem to linger round her brow, Or will they vanish like the bubbles on the rill? A penny for your thoughts! For your heart's a cruel rover, 'Tis beating now for Jenny Dow, that lives beyond the mill. III A penny for your thoughts! They are plain beyond concealing; Who cannot read a sighing lover through and through? A penny for your thoughts! I have something worth revaling: Fair maids though full of vows, are fickle and untrue; Now throw those flattering hopes away, Tomorrow's Jenny's wedding dayâ One with a winning voice has gained her yielding will! A penny for your thoughts! On your mind a change is stealing, What think you now of Jenny Dow, that lives beyond the mill? A THOUSAND MILES FROM HOME. BALLAD. The following poem is scored for music in the source text. [1] Far from my childhoods scenes, with weary steps I roam; Laden with weight of care, a thousand miles from home; Old times return to me, Days of pleasure nights of glee; While I'm beyond the sea a thousand miles from home. A thousand miles from home. Oh! how the heart will droop, a thousand miles from home. [2] Where are those early hopes, that made my footsteps stray; Faded while summer bowers, are blooming on my way; Sweet song of birds I hear, Childhood's voices bright and clear; All fail my soul to cheer a thousand miles from home. A thousand miles from home. Oh: how the heart will droop, a thousand miles from home. LITTLE JENNY DOW. BALLAD The following poem is scored for music in the source text. I. Little Jenny Dow lives beyond the mill, Her merry voice is heard all round; Her happy smiles are seen on the green clad hill, Where ere the budding flow'rs are found, She greets the blushing morn like a dew drop bright, And carols thro' the live long day; She gladdens up my heart like a beam of light, And drives my bitter cares away. CHORUS. Merrily, merrily, merrily, Her winning little voice is ringing, And the woodland birds are singing To little Jenny Dow II. Many are the hearts that have sigh'd for her, And many that have sigh'd in pain, Many that I know would have died for her, And alas they would have died in vainâ Little Jenny Dow never clouds her brow In sorrow o'er a love lorn swain; With spirits full of glee none so gay as she, As she rambles o'er the hill and plain. CHORUS. Merrily, merrily, merrily, Her winning little voice is ringing, And the woodland birds are singing To little Jenny Dow III. By the gushing streamlets her footsteps glide, Leaving little prints in the sand; You'll meet her in the dale or the woodland wide, Giving life and joy to the land: Ever may she roam with the same light heart, Ever may she sing with glee; While the summer days can their beams impart, And summer birds their melody. CHORUS. Merrily, merrily, merrily, Her winning little voice is ringing, And the woodland birds are singing To little Jenny Dow I WILL BE TRUE TO THEE.

I will be true to thee, I will be true to thee. 3 I will be true to thee; I will pray for thee night and day; Wilt thou be true to me, As in years that have rolled away? When all thy childhood's dearest hopes have fled And gloomy visions linger round thy head, When all thy dear and early friends are dead, Then I will be true to thee. I will be true to thee, I will be true to thee. The Merry, Merry Month of May. The following poem is scored for music in the source text. 1. We roamed the fields and river sides, When we were young and gay; We chased the bees and plucked the flowers, In the merry, merry month of May.

Our voices echo'd through the glen, With blithe and joyful ring; We built our huts of mossy stones, And we dabbled in the hillside spring.

We joyed to meet and griev'd to part, We sigh'd when night came on; We went to rest with longing heart, For the coming of the bright-day dawn.

The following poem is scored for music in the source text. 1. My Mother and my home, Ah! what pleasant words to me, They light up my drooping heart whereever I may be, And the joys of other days o'er my senses gently glide, While lonely I struggle with the worlds busy tide, While I rest from my tolls at the close of day, And bright happy visions around me play, Recalling the loved voices far away, I dream of my mother and my home. My mother, my mother. How old time memories will come, dream of my dear and gentle mother, I dream of my mother and my home. 1. My Mother and my home! Ah! the happy days are gone, When all their sweet blessings were around my pathway thrown, But visions of bright days will still come back again Renewing departed joys like some familiar strain, I see many homes filled with mirth and glee, But now in this wide world there's none for me; But the hours brighter grow, and my heart beats free, When dream of my mother and my home. My mother, my mother. How old time memories will come, dream of my dear and gentle mother, I dream of my mother and my home. âTHAT'S WHAT'S THE MATTER.â The following poem is scored for music in the source text. I. We live in hard and stirring times, Too sad for mirth, too rough for rhymes; For songs of peace have lost their chimes, And that's what's the matter! The men we held as brothers true, Have turn'd into a rebel crew; So now we have to put them thro', And that's what's the matter! CHORUS. That's what's the matter, The rebels have to seatter; We'll make them flee, By land and sea, And that's what's the matter! II. Oh! yes, we thought our neighbors true, In dulg'd them as their mothers do; They storm'd our bright Red, White and Blue, And that's what's the matter! We'll never give up what we gain, For now we know we must maintain Our Laws and Rights with might and main; And that's what's the matter! CHORUS. That's what's the matter, The rebels have to seatter; We'll make them flee, By land and sea, And that's what's the matter! 3 The rebels thought we would divide, And Democrats would take their side; They then would let the Union slide, And that's what's the matter! But, when the war had once begun, All party feeling soon was gone; We join'd as brothers, ev'ry one! And that's what's the matter! CHO'S. 4 The Merrimac, with heavy sway, Had made our Fleet an easy preyâ The Monitor got in the way, And that's what's the matter! So health to Captain Ericsson, I cannot tell all he has done, I'd never stop when once begun, And that's what's the matter! CHO'S. 5 We've heard of Gen'ral Beauregard, And thought he'd fight us long and hard; But he has play'd out his last card, And that's what's the matter! So what's the use to fret and pout, We soon will hear the people shout, Secession dodge is all play'd out! And that's what's the matter! CHO'S. BETTER TIMES ARE COMING.

Sound the news from the din of battle booming, Tell the people far and wide that better times are coming. 2 Abra'm Lincoln has the army and the navy in his hands, While Seward keeps our honor bright abroad in foreign lands; And Stanton is a man, who is sturdy as a rock, With brave men to back him up and stand the battle's shock. Chorus. 3 Now McClellan is a leader and we'll let him take the sway, For a man in his position, he should surely have his way. Our nation's honor'd Scott, he has trusted to his might, Your faith in McClellan put for we are sure he's right. Chorus. 4 Generals Lyon and Baker and Ellsworth now are gone, But still we have some brave men to lead the soldiers on; The noise of the battle will soon have died away, And the darkness now upon us will be turn'd to happy day. Chorus. 5 Generals Sigel and Halleck they have conquered in the West, And Burnside, victorious, he rides the ocean's breast, The traitors and the rebels will soon meet their doom; Then peace and prosperity will dwell in every home. Chorus. 6 Captain Foote is commander of the Mississippi fleet, For his flag he strikes and makes the traitors beat a quick retreat; With iron-clad gun-boats he makes the rebels run, While Grant makes our colors wave and glitter in the sun. Chorus. 7 General Fremont the path-finder never lags behind, He is gone to the mountains, new pathways to find. His voice is for freedom, and his sword is for the right, Then hail! noble Fremont the nation's delight. Chorus. 8 From the land of the Shamrock there's stuff that never yields, For we've brave Colonel Corcoran, and gallant General Shields; From Meagher soon we'll hear, for we know that he is true, And stands for the honor of the Red, White and Blue. Chorus. 9 Here's health to Captain Ericsson, the Monitor and crew, Who showed the southern chivalry a thing they never knew; The Merrimac had slayed as St. Patrick did the toads, Till Worden with the Monitor came into Hampton roads. Chorus. SLUMBER MY DARLING. The following poem is scored for music in the source text. 1 Slumber my darling, thy mother is near Guarding thy dreams from all terror and fear.

Merry little birds are we, Twit, twit, twee, Twit, twit, twee, Merry little birds are we, For the summer days are coming. 2.

Chorus. Merry little birds, &amp;c. 3. We greet the morning beams With a welcome to the May, We carol to the streams When we wake at break of day; The birds are on the bough, And the verdure on the plain, We'll all be happy now, For the spring has come again.

No home at night with its bright and cheerful hearth, To soften the cares of day,â No smiles of joy and familiar sounds of mirth, Beguiling my bitter hours away. The mild skies may lend unto me their light, And meadows around me bloom,â But through the long and the cheerless hours of night, I find for my drooping heart no home, I find for my drooping heart no home, No home for my heart, no home.

You would know him in a thousand by his dark and flashing eye. Tell me, tell me weary soldier, will he never come again, Did he suffer 'mid the wounded or die among the slain? 2. Was my brother in the battle when the noble Highland host Were so wrongfully outnumbered on the Carolina coast; Did he struggle for the Union 'mid the thunder and the rain, Till he fell among the brave on a bleak Virginia plain? Oh, I'm sure that he was dauntless and his courage ne'er would lag While contending for the honor of our dear and cherished flag. Tell me, tell me, &amp;c. 3. Was my brother in the battle when the flag of Erin came To the rescue of our banner and protection of our fame, While the fleet from off the waters poured out terror and dismay Till the bold and erring foe fell like leaves on Autumn day?

I wander where we've often strayed, In childhood's hours now passed and gone. I view the scenes where we have played, And mourn the joys forever flown; And yet I know if thou wouldst seek, To drive me from thy memory, Thy guardian angel then would speak, And tell the love I bear for thee, The love I bear for thee.

Nothing but a plain old soldier, An old revolutionary soldier, But I've handled a gun Where noble deeds were done, For the name of my commander was George Washington. 2. The friends I loved the best have departed, The days of my early joys have gone, And the voices once dear And familiar to my ear, Have faded from the scenes of the earth one by one The tomb and the battle have laid them low, And they roam no more where the bright streams flow, I'm longing to join them and soon must go, For I'm nothing but a plain old soldier. Nothing but a plain old soldier, An old revolutionary soldier, But I've handled a gun Where noble deeds were done, For the name of my commander was George Washington. 3. Again the battle song is resounding, And who'll bring the trouble to an end? The Union will pout, and Secession ever shout, But none can tell us now which will yield or bend. You've had many Generals from over the land, You've tried one by one and you're still at a stand, But when I took the field we had one in command, Yet I'm nothing but a plain old soldier. Chorus. Nothing but a plain &amp;c. I'D BE A FAIRY. The following poem is scored for music in the source text. In the cheerful days of spring Days bright and airy, Oft in mirthful glee I sing I'd be a fairy!

Sitting by my own cabin door, Sitting by my own cabin door. 3 I've had my hours of grief and mirth, And felt the tear drops pour, But nothing grieves me now on earth, For I'm sitting by my own cabin door.
