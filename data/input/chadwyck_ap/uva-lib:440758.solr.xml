Abigaill Tompson, And sent to her husband in uirginia, while he was sent to preach the gospell yr.â i am gon to all bliss The blessed news i send to the is this: That i am goon from the unto all bliss, Such as the saints &amp; angells do enjoy, Whom neither Deuill, world, nor flesh anoiy. To bliss of blisses i am goon: to him Who as a bride did for him selfe me trimm. Thy bride i was, a most unworthy one, But to a better bridegroom i am gon, Who doth a Count me worthy of him selfe, Tho i was neuer such a worthles elfe. He hath me Cladd with his own Righteousness, And for the sake of it he doth me bless. Thou didst thy part to wash me, but his grace Hath left no spott nor wrincle on my face. Thou little thinkst, or Canst at all Conceiue, What is the bliss that i do now receiue. When oft i herd th? preach &amp; pray &amp; sing I thought that heauen was a glorious thing, And i belieud, if any knew, twas thou That knewest what a thing it was; but now I se thou sawest but a glimps, and hast No more of heauen but a little tast, Comp?red with that which hear we see &amp; haue, Nor Canst haue more till thou art past the graue. Thou neuer touldst me of the Tyth, nor yet The hundred thousand thousand part of it. Alas, Dear Soule, how short is all the fame Of the third heauens, where i translated amm! O, if thou euer louest me at all, Whom thou didst by such loueing titles Call, Yea, if thou louest Christ, (as who doth more?) Then do not thou my Death too much deplore. Wring not thy hand, nor sigh, nor mourn, nor weep, All tho thine Abigaill be faln a sleep. Tis but her bodyâthat shall ryse again; In Christs sweet bosomb doth her soule remain. Mourn not as if thou hadst no hope of me; Tis i, tis i haue Caus to pitty thee. O turne thy sighings into songs of prais Unto the name of god; lett all thy Days Be spent in blessing of his name for thiss: That he hath brought me to this place of bliss. It was a blessed, a thrice blessed, snow Which to the meeting i then waded through, When piercd i was upon my naked skinn Up to the middle, the deep snow within. There neuer was more happie way i trodd, That brought me home so soone unto my god Instead of Braintry Church; Conducting mee Into a better Church, where now i see, Not sinfull men, But Christ &amp; those that are Fully exempt from euery spot &amp; skarr Of sinfull guilt, where i no longer need Or word or seale my feeble soul to feede, But face to face i do behould the lamb, Who down from heauen for my saluation Came, And thither is asended up again, Me to prepare a place whear in to Raign, Where we do allways hallaluiahs sing, Where i do hope for the to Come err long To sing thy part in this most glorious song. âtranscribed march 2, 1722â3, upon thr Death of my Dear honoured father, Mr William Tompson, pastor of the Church of Christ in Braintry, Decemb. 10, 1666, whose dying words were: âloue the lamb, loue, loue the lamb.â pend by that holy man of god, Mr John Willson, the first pastor unto y? first Church in boston, that holy reuerend man of god.â Anagram i: William Tompson, most holy paule mine. Most holy paule, mine answer was, In my temptacions all, When as the deuill tempted me, As much or more then paul. He did acount himselfe to be Of sinners all the Chief; So i my selfe accounted, yet How great was his relief! Nor did the lord Count it en?gh To show him so much grace, But mongst his one ambasadors Gaue him a specill place, And all his labours did so bless, As none Conuerted more, Amongst the gentiles, to the faithâ From heauen he had such power. And me, unworthy me, the lord Did pardon through Christs blood; Yea, as his messenger he sent To do his people good In england ould, that found it so There hath bene not a few, Nor hath his blessing been with held From me in England new. And as paule exercised was With trials more then any, So he was pleased to uisit me With trials more then many: Not onely persecutions Of proud malignant foos, But he hath let the deuill loose Me strongly to oppose, As he did paule with buffeting That he was black and blew, So that he was at his wits end And knew not what to do. He prayed once, yea, twice, yea, thrice, With Cryes importunate, Yet Could not his requests obtain In his forlorn estate. His troubles still remaind and he Was tempted more &amp; more With diabolicoll Assalts Which uexed him full sore, And all the answer which ye lord Or first or last did giue him, Was this: that with suphicient grace His spirit should reliue him, And Satan, when he did his worst, Should not so far preuaile As that gods fauour or pauls faith Him utterly should faile. No more it did; no more did mine, Tho sumtimes I did think, In midst of my temptacions I utterly should sink. How is it els, that all this while So many Darts of hell Haue not preuailed from my hart Gods spirit to expel? How is it els, with uiolenc My self i did not kill? Which was the deuils strong deuice Might he have had his will. How is it els, that all this while I Cast not of the lord, Tho he hath seemd to cast of me, As of his soule abhord, But in my hart haue loued him, As peter eu'n then did When as his tong once, twise, yea, thrice, So fowly him denied? And still his word, his ministers, His ordinances, saints, Haue still to me bene uery dear In saddest of my plaints. O, let not any think that I Was quite of god forsaken, Tho with such lamentable fits I was so long o're taken. William Tompson Lo my ionah slumpt Anagr 2 For lo! my ionah how he slumpt, In seas and whale so deep, Becaus the lords Comandement He did refuse to keep. And i oft did, and do, Confess That i no less deserued, As haueing from the duties of My Calling no less swerued. No maruell then that j was cast Into the sea &amp; whale, And that such horrid, hellish darts Against me did preuail. But ionah in those wofull depths Did pray unto his god, And so haue I done, often times, Under his heauie rod. How peuish &amp; peruers was he, But not so much as I, That haue Contested with the lord &amp; stood out, stood out stubornly. Yet, o dear brethren that suruiue, Do not acount me lost, Whome Christ redemed by his blood, And at so great a Cost, Throw price where of, as ionah did A pardon full obtain, So do i now: in Christ his lap My soul doth now remain. With ionah now Ime Cast ashore; The whale Could not me keep; But in my sauiour iesus Christ, I swetly fell asleep. If paul &amp; ionah will not serue To satisfie your mind, Concider job, &amp; be not like To his unfriendly friends. Becaus he was in satans hand So long in deep distress, They iudged him an hipocrite, And sum think me no less. But iob was job from first to last, Highly by god approued, By whome his most Censorious friends Most sharply wear reproued. As iob was gold, when at the first, God Cast him in the fire, So forth he came as gold most pure, E'uen as you would desire; And in his sore temptation, Once &amp; againe he spake As if the man of patients Were weary of his yoake; Yet well we know how god made his Captiuitye return, And doubly he did recompenc What long did make him mourn. O, what a blessed end did god For his pore seruant make, And of pore me, not less but more Compassion did he take; For now, amongst his angels all &amp; saints, in heauen j sing With solemn hallalugies to My reconciled king. Concider Asaph with heman, Good jerymy &amp; Dauid, How deep and long theire Terrours were, Yet they wear surely sauid. Concider Mary Magdelen, With seuen foul fiends posest, What wear her moanes, her syghs &amp; tears: Yet found she happie rest, Concider, hard by Christ his Cross, The miserable thiefe: But who had from his mouth &amp; hand A more Compleat releif? Yea, pray, Concider Christ himself, The prince of our saluation: Was euer soul or body in So great a tribulation? Of men, yea, &amp; of god him self, O how was he forsaken! Yet from his hellish Torments all, At last to heauen up taken To highest glory; twas in him That I did put my trust, And in his righteousnes i stood Before my father just, When at the lowest ebb; and now My soul with him doth rest, Of joys &amp; Consolations Unspeakably posest.

      <field name="fulltext">JOHN WILSON'S A SONG OF DELIVERANCE A Song of Thanksgiving for the lasting Remembrance of Gods wonderful work, never to be forgotten. The Introduction from out of the XXXI. of Deuteronomy, where God chargeth Moses to make his Song. Behold thou shalt with thy fore-Fathers sleep, As for this People, [whom thou art to leave âThey will not long my Testimonies keep, âThough now they seem to them so fast to cleave] âBut they will rise up [after thou art gone, âTo scorn my word, and trample it upon] âAfter the Gods a whoring will they run, âOf the strange People which are in the Land, âWhither they are to take possession, [âAnd them amongst to fix their wandring band.] âMe will they cast away, (and are so weak) âMy [holy Cov'nant, made with them to break. âThen shall my wrath against them kindled be, âEven in that day [my fury shall be hot,] âThem I'l forsake, that have forsaken me, âAnd hide my face from them that me forgot. âAnd they shall of their foes be eaten up, âTasting of heavy woe and bitter cup. âSo that themselves shall be inforc't to say, âIn midst of sorrow [came not all these woes, âOn us, because our God is gone away, âMong us no longer to have his repose?] âI will from them in hiding hide my face, âThat evils-all, and other Gods embrace. âNow therefore write you, for your selves, this Song, âWhich thou mayst teach the Isralytish fry, âPutting the same into their mouth, [and tongue] âThat it for me 'gainst them may testifie; âFor I will them into the Country lead, âBy Oath unto their Fathers promised. â[The Country,] which with milk and hony flows, âWhere, having eat their fill and waxen fat, âVnto strange Gods they will their heart dispose, âAnd worship them [upon their faces flat,] âBut me they will contemptuously provoke, âBreaking my Cov'nant, [casting off my yoke.] âAnd it shall be, when many evils-sore âShall them befall, and make them much complain. âThis Song shall witness, [if there were no more,] â(In mouth of all their Seed still to remain) âThat I foreknew, what's in their heart or hand âBefore I bring them to the promis'd Land. Who so would see this song of heav'nly choice, Penn'd by that holy Shepherd, Isrells guide, And sweetly uttered with a swan-like voyce, When here his Soul no longer might abide; Let him unto that holy Fountain goe, From whence such streams do plentifully flow. Nor shall he need to think his time mispent: Deut. 32 For what is there to Israel committed, Hath a more large and general extent, And to our present times may well be fitted. Now is that wall of separation down, Now that is ours, which then was their Renown. And oh that in their holy Name alone, And other graces, we did them succeed! Oh that their falshood and rebellion Had not in us like bitter root and breed! Oh that by their Example we might see, Such thoughts, such deeds, such sorrows how to flee, For us another Canan is provided Far better; better milk, and better honey, We look our Spirits should ere long be guided, To Heav'n it self, where without price or money, We shall enjoy what here we may but tast, A joyful-blessed life for aye to last. Oh then! what manner ones should we be here? And how refin'd should be both life and heart? Not like this world, but like our Country dear, Where none but holy ones have any part. We need not fear these Cananites to follow: Who be all perfect, none unsound or hollow. Yee that in Sion are secure, awake; Yee that do waver in a Sea of doubt, How long wil't be, ere the right way ye take, Halting no more, or compassing about? Or God, or Baal, Christ, or Masse adore; Choose which you will: serve one, but halt no more. Remember who it is that witness bare, âEven that Amen the witness true and sure, âWho made all Creatures to be what they are, âI know thy works [they cannot proof endure] âThou art not cold, nor art thou hot enough, âI would thou wert key cold, or hot in love. âSith then that Luke-warm is the frame and mold [âWhich all this while after all my cost,] âThou hast attained; neicher hot nor cold [âSo that my labour seems to be but lost,] âI am resolv'd, [Consider what I say] âOut of my mouth to spew thee quite away. Oh heavy doom, how can we chuse but tremble! âWe say we're rich, and full, and nothing need: âBut God knows all; [he knows how we dissemble] âPoor wretched-Caytifes, without sight or weede; âBuy then of him, gold, Robes, and Ointment bright, âRich, cloth'd, to make us; and of clearer sight. Then shall we see the end of all his Threts, [That he an holy awe might keep us in;] And why his naked glittering Sword he whets, [That we might well repent us of our sin;] And why he doth such strange deliv'rance send, [That we might praise him, and our lives amend.] This very end it was that moved me, (Though not so fit, to undertake the Taske,) To frame this Song, or Story (as you see) (Be sure the liquor's good, what ere the caske.) For here, as in a glass you may behold, The works that God hath wrought, some new, some old. Yet none so old, but young men may remember The farthest works that here I shall recite, Have they been hid as under heaps of ember? Now will I take them up into the light. Indeed they are not hid, but men are blind, And loth to call the works of God to mind. For diverse worthy ones with faithful pen, Have writ the most that I am writing here, Calling to th' praise of God, unthankful men (Which might their Souls unto his grace endeer) But oh! how few do prize such godly pains, Or reap unto themselves such profer'd gains? Yet will I venture; all are not alike; God will have prayses (for they be his due,) A silly rod the stony Rock may strike, A silly Song forgotten works renew. If men be mute, then babes; if babes, an Asse Or else the stones, shall bring Gods will to pass. And if you'l have me tell you all my heart, 'Tis not my hope (yet would I not presage) That men will take my plainness in good part. But come, ye children, ye of tender Age, This unto you I write, and thus in Verse, That ye might best conceive, learn, and reherse. Come Children, hearken and consider well, Gods Word will teach you best, but works withal (Such works as I shall very plainly tell) Will teach you, how with fear on God to call. Thou Lord, which dost the little ones affect, Let this poor Song thy little ones recall. A Song of Thanksgiving for the lasting Remembrance of Gods wonderful work, never to be forgotten. First, I'le begin with Eighty eight, That most admyred year, When't was in king of Spains conceipt Ore's all to domineer. The Seas were spred with stately saile, their Men and their Munition Were all prepared without faile to bring us to perdition. How many scores of Shipping-tall, and of their Gallyes long! How many Regiments withal of Souldiers stout and strong! How many hundred Horse to praunce, and Mules for carriage meet! How many thousand Ordinance were carryed in the Fleet! How many hundred thousand pound of Powder and of Bullet! How many millions were found of victuals for the Gullet! Who so would make a just account must reckon for the least, For to such number all amount as cannot be exprest. Besides, great store and company of tearing torturing Whips, And instruments of cruelty, provided in their Ships; As meaning not to be so kind, our blood at once to spill, But by our lingring pain, their mind and bloody lusts to fill. From seven years old, (or if not so, from ten and so forth on) All had been kill'd, both high and low, their Sword could light upon. Virgins had dyde, when they had first the Virgins honour lost: Women unript, on Spears accurst, had seen their Infants tost. The children, whom they meant to save, with brand of Iron hot, Were in their face (like Indian slave,) to bear a seared spot. Their Soul (alas) had been a spoyle to Soul-destroying Pope; Their bodyes spent in restless toyle, without all ease or hope. There were but few that should obtain this mercy, which was such As if you reckon up the gaine, You'l say it was not much. Yea, they that serv'd the Romish gods had been within the hemme Of Spanish sword, which knew no odds (or small) twixt us and them. For death of Catholicks (quoth they) we need not to be sorry: Their Souls shall goe the Catholick way; to Heaven or Purgatory. As for their wealth and dignity, all this for us doth make; For all (how much so ere it be,) shall fall unto our stake. Oh blessed Souls! whatbetter course the highest heaven to merit, Then if such Catholicks, perforce, their lands and goods inherit? âSuch Catholicks as had the Popes âmost solemn blessing past, âTo all that would their wealth and hopes, âinto this Navy castâ âFor (you must know) the Popes Crusade âwas sent, or gentle Bull, âTo all that would this great Armade, âenrich with purses full. âOr, gave thereto a lesser fleece; âwho so gave what they could, âWere quit, for thirteen pence a piece, âof all sins new and old âThus went the Host to Sea with fame, ârenowned there to brave it; âThe invincible Navy was the name âtheir holy Father gave it. âNor doubted they to make their Song âof triumph before hand, âAs if already Spanish throngs âhad conquered our land. âMendoz' mendaciously begun, âin France to give it out, â[England is won, all England won, âtheir forces put to rout.] âMedyna was the Admiral âof this new Christned Fleet, âWho left his wife, friends, goods and all, âin zeal (but indiscreet.) âHe sought to Christ and Mary both, âand to all Saints beside; âSole Christ to credit very loth, âin doubtful wind and tide. âOur little Fleet in July first, âtheir mighty Fleet did view: âShe came but with a softly course, âthough winds behind her blew. âHer front much like the Moon was crook't, â(the horns seven miles asunder) âHer Mastes like stately Towers look't, âthe Ocean groaning under. âAnd now behold they were at hand, âdaring our English Borders, âMaking full sure to bring our Land âUnder their Spanish orders: But God above, laughing to scorne their wicked wile and wealth, To his Annointed rais'd an horne of hope and saving health. âPrince, Prophets, people, joyntly cry'd âTO CHRIST ALONE for ayd; âWhose power invincible was try'd âwith Banner all displayd. âThat noble Drake drave on apace, âand made the Spaniard dive; âAnd Hawkins follow'd hard the chase, âthem all away to drive. âWith these, well forbisht Forbisher, âtheir Navy did assayle: âAll at her back did thunder her âand swept away her tayle. âThose were the Worthies three, which first, â(next to their Admiral) âVentur'd the hostile ranks to burst, â(spight of their Don-Recall) âAnd many moe of great renowne âdid bravely play their part, âIn skill and valour putting downe âthe Spanish strength and art. âBut why do I record the men, âthat fought with such as brav'd us? âI said, (and so I say agen,) â[It was the Lord that sav'd us.] He arm'd from Heaven his mighty Hoast, to batter Babel's Towers: His Angels (though unseen) oppos'd their side, and helped ours. âThey which to creatures yield the trust âfrom the Creator taken, âOf him and them it is most just âthey should be quite forsaken. The blustring winds, the swelling waves, the crackes of flashing fire, Each in their turn did check the braves of Spains inraged Ire. Eight of our Ships, of wild-fire, pitch, Rosen, and brimstone full, And such like other matter which was most combustible, Were set on fire; and (guided well) in secret of the night, By help of wind, it them befell on Spanish Fleet to light. The Spaniards saw how near they came, (at Anchor as they lay,) The Sea all-bright with shining flame (as if it had been day.) Who fearing lest our Ships (beside the hurt of fierie crack) Might with some deadly Engines ride, unto their utter wrack: All lifting up with one consent an hideous woful cry, Did fill with bitterest lament the Ocean and the Sky. Some pull up Anchors, some for hast their massie Cables cut: They set up Sayles, and all agast, their hand to Owers put. And, smitten with a pannick terror, confusedly they fled, As whom their own bewitching error, To shame and sorrow led. They fled with shame, the way they came, one from another scattred: Their Shipping tall with Cannon ball, was soundly beat and battred. Their reckning was, that Parmoes Duke should help them with his force; But God his courage did rebuke, from taking such a course. 'Tis best, thought he, for me and mine, to keep us where we are; For they (we see) are fain to whine, that ventured so farre. Our Holland-friends with us kept watch, upon the coast of Flanders: He might have soon met with his match, if not with his Commanders. Yet at the last he was so stout, when to the Lady of Hall, His vowes were paid on knees devout) his Armed Troops to call; With whom he did to Dunkerk pass (but later then was meet) So that by some he twitted was, as false to Spanish Fleet. Thus where they left of God and men, to wracks of wind and weather. Their thoughts were high before, but then, they fainted altogether. They came not forth so thick before; but now they went as thin, Their numbers were abated sore, that numberless had bin. âAs Saul did Amalek, or worse, âthey vow'd us all to handle, âAs whom their Balaam did curse âwith Book, and Bell, and Candle. âBut they themselves combining thus, âwhere the true Amalex-brood, âof God accurst for cursing us, âin their malitious mood. âThemselves were made a gazing stock, âa by-word and reproach, âUpon the Israelitish flock, âpresuming to encroach. Thus might they ban their Idol gods, with discontented lours, And well perceive the mighty odds, between their faith and ours. âFor though sometime, the way is not âbest, that hath best success: âAnd 't may be holy Sions lot, âto suffer great distress: âNor is a Church prov'd good or ill, âby any outward things; âBut that is known for Sion-hill âthat Scripture warrant brings: âYet such as Idols do adore, âor Christ an Idol make, âPreferring Idols him before, âor parting them a stake; âWhat heavy dooms do them abide âcome from Gods wrath above, âAs what the Saints doth well betide, âconfirms them in his love. âThus God in dayes of elder hue âdid take his peoples part, âWhen Egypts King did them pursue, âinto the red Seas heart. âTheir wheels fell of, and Chariots went, âFull oft (for all their frowning) âAnd then by flying back they meant, âto save themselves from drowning. âThey said before, We will them follow, âand take, and put to foyle; âThey are a prey for us to swallow, âand for our Sword to spoyle. âBut by and by they chang'd their Song, âOh let us flee apace, âGod doth the Hebrews fight among, âTo kill us in this place. âFor God with sudden winds did blow, âupon the heaped waves, âAnd made them soon to overflow, âthe proud in all their braves. âThey sank as led in waters gulph, âHorse, Chariots, men, and all. âThe Sheep escap't. the cruel Wolfe âhimself did get the fall. âThen Moses sang victoriously, âand all his saved Traine, âLed through the Sea most gloriously, âto the dry Land again, âThey looked back, and saw their Foes âfloating some here, some there, âWhom late and long they feared, those âthey caused now to fear, âThe women sang with pleasant voyce, âat Myriams direction, âWth dance, and Timbrels merry noyse, âfor this so rare protection, What better type of Englands bliss, saved from Spanish fury? The Sea, that was our safety, is a grave our foes to bury. Even now, we heard of their approach, (who feared not that heard it? But by and by, to their reproach, They fled before they feard it. Not above fifteen of our Ships, did bear the battels brunt, Which being light with nimble Skips, did theirs at pleasure hunt, Nor was there any shipping lost, of ours save only one; And that our Enemies dearly cost, (better th'ad let't alone.) When many hundreds had been slain for one of ours, or less, Chased away with broken Traine, they wandred in distress With Tempests they were tost and shaken, (all Brittain driv'n about.) Some drowned in the deep, some taken, where they could ill get out. Some of them cast on Scottish shores, (and by the Kings release, More then seven hundred Souldiers were sent away in peace.) On Irish shores were others cast, who fared not so well,) Wild Irish, Fowle, foul Weathers blast, upon these fiercely fell. Their Navy, which with wondrous cost, was full three years preparing, In one Months space was (well nigh) lost, without our cost or caring. (I say it was not cost so much or care of ours prevail'd, But God would have the pride of such as fought against him quail'd.) Of all their goodly Ships remain'd after this dismal War; Scarce forty which at all attain'd, to their own Havens-bar. And those that with so much adoe, at last arrived thither, With heavy hearts needs must they goe all rent with War and Weather. No sooner came this happy news, unto our listning ear, But all our sad laments and rues were turn'd to merry chear. Our VIRGIN-QUEEN with holy dance, unto her Timbrel sang, Our Land for this Deliverance, with shouting-Ecchoes rang. Her Soul had marcht (like Deborah) amidst the armed Train, Her Faith had scorn'd with holy laugh the bragging Hoast of Spain. In hottest danger did she rest, Upon the Lord she serv'd; And him in midst of Triumph blest, as he had well deserv'd. Unto the house of God she went, in royallest array, With thankful and devout intent her promis'd vows to pay: The Nobles her accompaned, each Citizen in colour, (The conquer'd Banners fully spred, to make the Triumph fuller.) The Preacher blaz'd with cheerful voyce, our glorious preservation, The Temple sounded with the noyse, of joyful acclamation. Kings Philips friends did much condole, to see his feats defeated, True Brittain lips seem'd with a cole, from heavenly Altar heated. But, oh alas! the real thanks, (which is our lives amending) Was far away; men of all ranks, their wicked lusts defending. God waited long for our return, unto a purer straine; But we cast off his Word with spurne, and horrible disdain. This made our God bethink himself, how to correct our sin, As Father whips his peevish elfe that hath unruly bin. (When Pharaohs Hoast was overthrown, yet no due fruit returned, The wrath of God against his own, gain-saying people burned.) 1603. And first, our Queen Elizabeth ended her life and Reign; To shew that all hope is a breath, soon come, soon gone again; Unless as children we depend on God the surest stay; Unless our hearts we fully bend, his pleasure to obey. Our grief was great for her decease, no lesser was our fear, But God did soon our Souls release and from all fainting reare. Our Sun was set, but rose a fresh, our hearts were fill'd with laughter, To see King James the Crown possess so quietly, soon after. No Spear against him lifted was, at home nor yet abroad, All as one man with common voyce, his coming did applaud, But least we should be overjoy'd, and hope beyond all bounds, Just then, our Kingdome was annoy'd, with Plague that all confounds: I say, all such in humane prop, as dare to put their trust, Not caring all the while to lop, or leave their wicked lust. Some three and twenty years agoe, (or there about) at least, God smote the Land with heavy blow of this contagious pest. In three moneths space to death did pine (witness the London-bill.) Thirty four thousand seventy nine, yet had not death its fill. Three thousand three hundred eighty five, in one week did depart, And many thousands moe alive, remained sick at heart. And in each County, City, Town, almost all England over, Men of all sorts were smitten down, nor could themselves recover. It should have then repented us, of our enormous life, Whereby we forc't our Father thus to wrath and anger rife. Though we would not repent, yet he repented ne're the less, His tender bowels yearn'd to see the depth of our distress. His bow unbent, his Arrows keen were cast behind the back. The flames which long full hot had been, were made ere long to slack. We for all this, resolved not more purely God to serve, Therefore our foes devis'd a Plot, such as our sins deserve. A Plot (to think on) so abhorr'd as heart doth fear and quake, A Plot, that when I would record, my pen and hand do shake. 1605. Full twenty years agoe it was, one thousand six hundred five, When Papists, zealous for the Masse, in England did contrive; The King, Queen, Peer, and noble Peers, the Prelate, Judge, and Knight, And Burgesses, with powder fire all at a clap to smite. At Dunkerk, and at Lambeth both, they did of things agree, With solemn Sacramental Oath, of deepest secrecy. When Spanish Navy had no force, nor Plots of forreign foes, They meant to take a surer course, the scap't bird to enclose. That is, with Art to undermine the house of Parliament, (No fitter place to be the signe, of such a damn'd intent.) There had the cruel Laws been made, against their Romish Priests, There will they dig with cruel spade, and meet their mining lists. But who would taxe (beside themselves,) of Rigour such a Law, As gave the use of life to Elves that had so curst a jaw? A jaw so curstly wide, as would have swallowed at a bit, Great Englands head and body, should the Lord have suffred it. After some digging they discry a Cellar to be near, Which they resolve to hire or buy, should it be ne're so dear. They laid their powder in this Vault, full six and thirty Barrels, With one unheard of deep assault, to end their former quarrels. (Note by the way the Romish Whore, hath Barrels in her Cellar. In March she brewed, or before, bot I'le be bold to tell her; Thy Christmas doth not yet approach why laist thou in so fast? Before thy time, thou mean'st to broach, thy brewing will be waste.) Billets and Faggots hid this stuff great stones and iron crowes, (To cause a more massacring puffe) were piled under those, Now was Novembers fifth at hand, when ore this hellish pit, Both head and body of the Land were all at once to sit. When furious Fauxe with matches three, (for spickets) was provided, The rest of this fraternity, were very closely sided. Monyes they had good store, and horse, (some more then was their own.) And thought to gather mighty force, by roving up and down. From Warwick-shire to Woster-shire, from thence to Stafford-shire, Thinking ere this, all Westminstir was over-turn'd with fire. They made the world believe, they went about a hunting-match, But for their spoyle and booty, meant our Souls and lives to catch. When first th'ad got, by force of Arms, the Lady Elizabeths Grace, Not doubting by their Popish charms; her Conscience to deface: And having blown away the King, and royal Issue male, They thought by Crowning her, to bring her will in servile thrall. Then had they in her name forth sent good store of Proclamations, Such as might fit with the intent of their Imaginations. Nor would they father by and by the Plot, (though 'twere their own,) But meant the infamy should lye where it was quite unknown. If you would know what kind of man, they would have thus traduced, Forsooth, it was the Puritan, (so in their stile abused.) Indeed they meant the Protestants, should all be under guilt, As if the blood of Popish Saints, at once they would have spilt. A Gull without all wit or sense (what will not malice say?) âThe Wolfe can soon find a pretence, âwhy the poor Lamb to slay. No, no: it was the Jesuit, and Priests of Popish faction, That brought them to this hideous pit, though they deny the action. Our doctrine loyal is, and course, like to our doctrine, loyal; They teach, (and put no less in force) to crush the Scepter royal, Who so their Anti-christian Sect will not their favour crown, Let him be King, born or elect, they'l seek to pull him down. And if their strength be not enough, to bring about the matter, Then Dagger, Dag, Fig, Powder-stuffe, shall stab, shoot, poison, scatter. Thus were their heads and hands at work, our State to overthrow, Supposing all the while to lurke, under some fairer show. But all this while they looked not to God that view'd them well, And layd all-ope their subtle Plot, forg'd by the Devil of hell. These privy works of wily men, so long and close concealed, By their own letter, hand, and pen, were suddenly revealed. The hole was searcht of crafty Cubs, and then appeared plain, The Wood, Stones, Iron, Gunpowder-tubs, and all the powder-train. At this Hell-mouth, with triple match, (dark Lantern in his hand,) Stood Fauxe in dead of night, to watch, and comers to withstand. His watching had but ill event, when from our watchful King, Those noble Patriots were sent, to find the secret thing. He was in Boots and best array, ('twas fit it should be so, Being to travail such a way, as he least thought to goe.) He was not vext so much about his taking, or his shame, As for his happe to be without, when the Kings searchers came; Else, he resolv'd, all void of grace, (that might have made him quake,) Them, and himself, with house and place,) a ruinous heap to make. About this time the hunting rout, that were in Country mounted, From Shire to Shire were hunted out, and sturdily affronted. Nor needed greater power rise their mutinies to quaile; The Sheriffes power did suffice to fetch them to the Jayle. They look't that all where ere they post should like and help the fact, Their reckoning was without the host: for all abhorr'd their Act. Yea, mark: the house that they were in (as in a harbour sure,) Might well convince them of their sin, and practising impure. For as their powder was too dry, (wherein they put their trust,) They saw it was but vanity, to hope in fickle dust; Which (touched with a sparke of fire,) hurt them by sudden flash, That were inflam'd with hot desire, the highest Court to quash. So their own powder did them tell, to their own very face, Their powder-workings were from Hell, most barbarous and base. One of them dreamed over-night, he saw strange looks and antick; Their morrow-faces in the light, prov'd this no fancy frantick; He dream'd, at the same time, and place, he saw strange tottering steeple, Which did presage the tottring case, of this seduced people. âThey say our Churches are their own, âour Bells, and Steeples tall, âBut striving for possession, âthey caught a fearful fall. âThey builded Castles in the Sky. â(no marvail if they waver, âThe bird may build her nest on high, â(not high enough to save her.) And here it may not be forgot, Catesby himself was one, (The first contriver of this Plot,) their powder flasht upon. In stead of whirling into Sky our Parliament, their own Roof (where they parl'd,) before their Eye, into the Sky was blown. And a great powder-bag, (entire,) was blown up therewithal: Which never taking any fire, came down full in the fall. To shew that God doth over-sway both fire and powder strong, And doth their strength hold or allay, as he sees right or wrong Suppose the fire had toucht the Train Under the Parliament, God could have made them both refrain their natural extent. Themselves were forc't upon this sight, Heavens-anger to confess, And on bent knees (all in a fright) their sorrows to express: âAs they, that found the Shepherds rod, âtheir devellish feats to quell, âAll trembling at the hand of God âfrom their presumption fell. Thus all their hopes were overthrown, and utterly confounded, And Popish-hunters in their own most cruel pit were pounded. Catesby and Piercy, brethren sworn, were caught and pierc't together, Back joyn'd to back, (and all forlorne,) by one shot, reaching thither. Two Wrights that with their open might, against their King rebelled, Of roisting Rebels had the right, by Sword of Justice quelled. Garnetts's to Gallows guarded sure, [Nor th' straw miraculous, Where Limner drew his face demure, sav'd him from dying thus.] Digby did for their digging pay, on Gibbit mounted up, Two Winters went the selfsame way, Keys dranke of this Cup. Tresham had tred no other track, if he had liv'd so long, Grant had his grant, the Rebel-pack, to end his life among. Rookwood, that would not better look, to hooks of bait-alluring, Was fain like heavy doom to brook, (with shame for ever during.) Fauxe like a Fox, was hanged high, and Bates his strength abated: âThose that in Treason joyne, must dye âthe death of Traitors hated. âThey'r dead, we live, even in their sight: âthey'r catcht, we scap't away; âWhat should have been their day, our night, âis now their night, our day. âEven as those three renowned ones, âin furnace seven times fired, âWere safe preserved. (flesh and bones, âskin, hair, and cloathes unseared: âThe smoak devouring at a lick âall them (and all entire) âWhich in their malice were so quick, âto cast them in the fire, âAnd as when Daniel was thrown, âinto the Lyons den, âThey spared him; but flesh and bone âall tore those wicked men. âSo when three Kingdomes with a blast, âfrom Babels flaming pit; âWere like to come to woful waste, âbefore they dream'd of it: âThe Son of God (that in the mids âof burning bush is dwelling) âSav'd us, and kept his tender kids âfrom claws of Lions yelling. âNay, (as if this unto his Grace, âhad seem'd too small a thing) âHe brought our foes into the place, âwhere they vow'd us to bring. Alas! if they had brought to pass, the things they took in hand, For Christ, the Pope, for Gospel Mass had reigned in our Land. And every where ther had been rife, Racks, halters, fire and stake, Or privy dungeon deaths, by knife, hunger, and poyson'd cake. But God was pleas'd from bitter brunts, of Antichristian thrall, To save us, and to just accounts those bloody men to call. Never since world began was thought Plot more abominable. Never Deliverance was wrought, more strange and admirable Our King was wise by a word to see their secret deep intent, Wiser to seal that firm decree in Court of Parliament, That year by year, most solemn thanks might to our God redound, Who did the Popish power and pranks so mightily confound. Here to insert, is not amiss, another later doom, Which did befal long after this some Romists in a room, Even for this end, that all the Land more freshly might remember, How God abhorr'd that Plot in hand, on fifth day of November. âFor he is privy to the rotten âframe of our thankless minds, âAnd sees how all would be forgotten âwithout some fresher signs; May't please you but to reckon by Gregorian Kalendar, Then will you say as much as I, am here to Register. 1623. In the one thousand year of grace, six hundred twenty three, (Upon Novembers fifth it was) some Papists did agree, To meet upon a Garret-flowre within Black-friers range, Near which, the French Ambassadour lodg'd, till this heavy change. Two or three hundred thither flockt, crowding with eager lust, The room was full (the dore unlockt) some to the stairs was thrust. Who so repair unto the yard, or garden where they went, Of this sad doom and vesper-hard, may see the monument. For 't was at Even-song that they met, upon the Lords own day, Which by his Ordinance is set, to teach us in his way. They came to hear Drury a Priest, from Babel thither sent, Who in his Jesuit parrel drest, did there his matter vent. Before his Sermon, on his knees at this chair feet he fell, Which was rear'd up by some degrees, that they might see him well. There did he some short prayer mutter as 't were an Ave-mary, No vocal prayer did he utter, (from us, perhaps to vary:) But presently fell to his Text, which was about the King; Who pardon'd much to him, that vext his mate for a small thing. Out of which Text he wringed this, as some (that heard him) say; 'Twould goe with all such Souls amiss, as from their fold do stray. Because forsooth their Sacraments, (as namely Penance doing) To cancel, are the Instruments what debts to God are owing. He preached by an hour-glass, (an Embleme very apt, To shew how near the period was, how life dy death intrapt.) Before the sand had run its course, his breath was to be gone, He made some way to his discourse, but went no farther on, The hand of God with sudden rush, upon the Chamber came, And did the Jesuit all to crush, I'th' ruins of the same. His Soul before that heav'nly King, did answer for this action, There learning best, what is the thing, that yields him satisfaction. This sure I am, unless he did sole Christ his pleader make, And Popish merits farewel bid, he could not chuse but quake With him well nigh an hundred more, men, women, one and other, By fall of beams, and upper flore, were crushed in the smother. So much o' th' Garret-flore fell, as was above the place. Where Father Rediate had his Cell and Papists went to Mass. But all their massing would not serve their Priest, or them at all; âThey that from Scripture Cannon swerve, âmust look at last to fall. Alas! what shrieks follow'd their mirth, what cryes most pittiful? Like theirs, whom once the gaping Earth, into her womb did pull: Or like the doleful noise of all that worshipt Dagons block; On whom the house did rush and fall, whiles they did Sampson mock; Or like that dismal cry and groane, throughout the Egyptian coasts, When, in one night each first born son, was slain by th' Lord of Hoasts; Or like the Galilean moane, when in sedition found, The sacrificers saw their own blood spilt upon the ground. This sad disaster might enforce a stony heart to melt, Which they in superstitious course strongly beguiled, felt. âSecrets belong unto the Lord, âthis we may well proclaim, âWhat lies be damned in his word, âhis works confute the same. They went about to blaze abroad, as if most cruelly, Some of the Protestants by fraud, had wrought their misery. By secret drawing out of pin, or sawing half asunder Some of the Timber, that was in the house to prop it under. But this's a vaile that Satan cast before their eyes to blind them, Thereby from sight of Judgement past, and due remorse to wind them. For plain it was, in strictest view, that by the peoples press And Sommeyrs mortazing undue, they came to this distress, And that Gods finger may appear, more plainly, no foundation Nor Wall did faile, but all entire the seeld Roof kept his station. âOh then, that those which did escape, âwith feet out of the snare, âMight learn no more to run or gape, âafter such Romish ware! âAnd that we all might learn to flee âfrom Babel and her dung, âLest for our filthiness we be, âinto her sorrows flung. But to return whence I digrest, (take the old stile or new,) Novembers fifth must be confest, worthy all lasting view. A day that justly was assign'd to the Almighties glory, A day when all should call to mind, the famous powder story: But this not all to God belongs, nor do we praise him best, By Sermons, Prayers, or loud Songs, Bells, Bone fires, or by Feast. All these are good, but somewhat else is of far better note; When heart, and life, our Souls and selves, to him are all devote. God looked for 't that all Estates should mend what was amiss, That Truth and Judgement in our Gates, should one another kiss. But we, alas! did soon forgit the mighty works of God, Not growing better any whit by shaking of the rod, Nor by the wrack beyond the Sea of Christian brotherhood; Nor Banners that our foes display, 'gainst Brittains royal blood; Nor by the safe return again, of our then royal-Prince, From his great venture into Spain, nor his deliv'rance since, (When he was safe in falling down by guard of Angels tended); Nor his safe coming to the Crown, rightly on him descended: These works of God could not suffice to draw us from our sinning, But still we kept the hue and size, we had at the beginning: This stirred up the Lord of Hoasts, to jealousie and rage, And made him smite again our Coasts, not sparing any Age. 1625. In the one thousand year of God, six hundred twenty five, Was sent the Pestilential rod, our rocky hearts to rive. In the chief City of the Realm, it had the chiefest seat: There like a Sea to overwhelm pride that was grown so great; Or like a fire to purge away, the dross of hateful sin; Or like a Trumpet thence to fray, the sleep that Souls were in. The Queen of Cityes wont to sit, in Chair of highest state, Now sate in dust and lowest pit, all sad and desolate: The highest Court of Parliament, to Oxford did remove. The Tearmers were to Redding sent, their Titles there to prove. Nor were the strangers strange alone, to the infected City; But her best lovers all were gone, and left her without pitty. I mean, the rich did flock away, and bade her streets adieu, Except the poor (which needs must stay) there stayed but a few. Nothing was heard but passing-bells, and friends their friends lamenting, Nothing but heavy doleful-knells. (Death not at all relenting) Nothing was seen but heaps of dead, to feed the hungry grave; Or others lying sick a bed, (no way their life to save.) Some looked pale, and some with pain were forc't to rave and roare, Some did the deadly marks sustain, and some the deadly sore: In one years space, or less then so, (from time the Plague began) To what a number did they grow, that death grip't in his span? Sixty two thousand at the least, Six hundred seventy seven, Were made appear by deaths arrest, before the God of Heaven. Yea, do but from Junes second look unto Decembers last, Scarce shall you read in English-book of like doom ever past. Within this three months space alone, as hath been duly counted, Fifty three thousand ninety one, by Bills report amounted. In London and the Liberties, (Six moe near Parishes add.) All the forenamed clos'd their eyes, and made their friends full sad. More dy'd in this then former pest, by th, heavy hand of God; In thirteen weeks (to say the least) Eleven thousand forty and odd. Of all which summs, the greatest part by death departed thence, Were pierced through with fiery dart, of raging Pestilence. If within and without one City Walls, were found of men such lack, More then six myriades of Souls brought to so heavy wrack: Oh then what was the wrack and spoyl of all the Land beside, In Cities and in Country soyle, throughout the Kingdome wide? Trading grew dead, and mony scant, the rich doubting their state, The poor were pinched sore with want, all fear'd the dismal fate. Men from their dwellings fled apace where these night Arrows fell, But picked Halberds in each place were set them to repell. The high wayes unfrequented were, men feared all they met, And many keeping home, were there caught in this spreading net. High time it was that when the Lord, was thus to fury bent, All of their sins, so much abhorr'd, should speedily repent. Our Royal King right humbly fell before the King of Grace, In mournful weeds, becoming well, this sad and heavy case. It pittyed him to see his sheep, by flocks to fall away, It made his very Soul to weep, to see their quick decay, Himself began, and then he made, his Subjects all to fast, By Proclamation he forbad, (so long as plague shall last) All other works, upon the day to fasting set apart, That all at once might weekly pray, to God with broken heart. Thus all at once pour'd out their groans, to God in this restraint; Filling both Heaven and Eatth with moans, and cryes of their complaint. And God which ever keeps his word, soon pittyed our woes, Bidding the Angel sheath his Sword, and slack his murdering blows. When in one week of sickness wanne, five thousan' a hundred five, Dy'd in the City, then began the City to revive. (Yet after this in six weeks space, of Plague and Feavers sore, There dyed in the foresaid place, full seventeen thousand more.) But oh! behold Gods mighty power: to grave were carryed thence, In twelve weeks, after this no more, but one of Pestilence. Even when the Plague was spread at length, into the Cities heart, Then did abate the raging strength, and poyson of his dart. âRight so the Jewish Church of old, âFor David's proud presumption, âAnd for their own rebellions bold, âfall'n in a quick consumption, âJust when the Angel stretcht his hand, âJerusalem to stroy, âIt pleased God no more their Land, âwith sickness to annoy. Yea mark; when those return'd again that from the City fled, And when the Country thick came in to market, boord, and bed, Who would have thought but by and by the Plague should be renewed? Yet did it still most quiet lye, as in a corner mewed. Never was heard of such a change; 't was but few dayes before, The sickness up and down did range, scarce passing by a dore. The very ayre it self might then seem to be quite infected; Now Churches, Streets, shops, houses, men, all sure and safe protected. The eyes which had not before seen, the Cityes desolation, Could scarce believe that there had been such deadly visitation. Six moneths are gone about at least, since that great ebbe and fall; Few all this while dy'd of the Pest, and some weeks none at all. Nor was the sickness driven out alone from London City, But in all Countries round about, was shewed the like pitty. For though some sparkles here and there, to awe us yet remain, Yet little breaks out any where, to burn us up again. Even in our Town (so far remote) when this dismal disease, On place, and house, and man of note, most dangerously did seaze: When Town and Country were afraid, it would have further spred, This deadly plague with dead was laid, as in a resting bed, (And there it should have rested still, as many weeks it did, If men had not their doings-ill with false pretences hid.) As for this Parish (thanks to God, by whom the lot is cast) To this day felt this heavy rod, not one from first to last. Cry of our sins and grace abus'd, did well deserve the worst, But God to hear that cry refus'd, (else had we been the first:) Now what may be the Lords intent, it is not hard to ghess, Even this, that we might all repent, and his free grace confess. Confess we all, before the Lord, his grace and mercy then, And shew his Acts with one accord, before the sons of men: In presence of his holy ones, praise him with joy and fear, Who doth revive our withered bones, and light from darkness rear. Man, Woman, child, both old and yongue, rich, poor, the low and high, Laud and extol with heart and tongue, the highest Majesty. Ye blessed Angels honour him, and all the heavenly band, Ye birds that flye, and fish that swim, and cattel of the Land, Let every City, Shire, and Town, Each Church, and house, and Soul, With thankful pen write his renowne in everlasting roule. Let all that lives confess his grace, that saves their life and fame. Let none by wicked life deface, the glory of his name. And thou my Soul remember well, the kindness of the Lord, Cease not with thankful lips to tell, the trueness of his word; Who gave thee pardon of thy sin, and kept thee from the smart, (For all the danger thou wert in) of the infectious dart. Thou Lord which from the Spanish yoke, and from the powder blast, And from that former sickness stroak, and from this newly past, Hast saved us, and ours, and thine, so many as survive, Oh do not of thy Grace divine our feeble Souls deprive. For we alas, are like to fall into the same excess, If to thy works thy grace withal, come not to work redress, So are we wedded to the toyes, of our own hearts devising. That we neglect the heav'nly joyes, from thy pure wayes arising. (Even when the scourge was on our back, how few their life amended? Our mending then must needs be slack, when once the Plague is ended.) Nor Navy, nor the powder Plot, nor frightful noise of war, Nor roaring of the Cannon shot. nor all the Plagues that are, Shall ought prevail, nor yet our strange Deliverance from all, Unless thy holy Spirit change, and draw our hearts withal: Then draw us Lord immediately, and we shall follow thee, And make us such effectually as thou wouldst have us be: So need we not to fear the Turke, Nor Pope, nor Spaine, nor Hell For thou shalt every evil work, Reveal, defeat, and quell. No sickness pestilential Shall smite our Tabernacle; Or if there do, thy mercy shall Be our safe Receptacle. Lord save thy Church, our King and State, Lord purge out all our dross, And such as do thy Gospel hate, Infatuate and cross Lord bless the Parliamental Court, (Vpper and lower House,) And when to Counsel they resort, In them remember us. From King that sits upon the Throne, To beggar in the Street: Let all their by-past sins bemoane Before thy mercy feet; That we and our Posterity, Safe-hid under thy wing, May ever of thy verity And saving mercy sing. FINIS. To God our twice-Revenger. We saw, but oh! how sad were we to see, Spains (prouder) Fleet on the proud Ocean spred An hundred ships there were, &amp; eight times three Which made it deem'd and nam'd unconquered. The antient Pilots were amaz'd to see't, When they beheld this new-huge bodied Fleet. The Sea with mazed smile saw in her bounds, All the Earths wealth and honor brought by Ships, But we all trembled at the frequent sounds Of Trumpets, Drummes: at naked Swords and Whips, (Sore threatned) wherewith all the Spaniard fell, Came arm'd this Brittain Nation to quell. Our hopes are in alone-torne Ship (befitted, With fire and Brimstone as her chiefest loade) She, without guide, is to the winds committed, And forth with cruel destiny she roade; [Them and her self with her own flames to spoyle] Winds serve; she burnt her self, put them to foile. Here were we cheer,d to see the Ocean maine, All white before with Sails, now purple grown. As suddenly with blood of Spaniards slain: Their Fleet is scattred, and their Ships o're thrown: Some sink, some burn i th' Sea, and some at last, After long wandring, on strange Shores are cast. [We saw, but oh! how glad were we to see] VVe saw, but oh! how glad were we to see, O cruel Rome, out of thy darksome den, So many weapons of thy villany And mighty Engines, pluckt by hands of men? Stones, Faggots, Crows, Gun-powder tubs we saw, These wines The Whore doth from her vessels draw. Long were they hid under the secret Vault, Of that great house; and there they were to lye, Till they were made (O horrible assault!) By wicked Faux his hand, aloft to flye. Those sacred rooms where Laws were wont to breed, To sudden wrack and ruine were decreed. King Prince, Peers, Prelates, Commons, Gospel bright, All at one blow together were to fall: Match was in hand to give the Trains their light, But God reveal'd, destroy'd, reveng'd them all. Hell needs not blush: for this Impiety Doth worst of men, fiends furies justifie. Hell never knew such wickedness as this, Another Hell (like it) there need a-been. Should Plot and pay be like? for both there is One measure: none of pay! for, none of sin. Should praise be like Gods grace? there is but one Measure for both: Grace had, praise must have none. A Pillar Consecrated. This Pillar bright, and [twice-Revenger's] name, Both to our God of right we are to reare; For he hath more then twice deserv'd the same, Here, having quell'd our Foes, and mockt'em there. They first destroyers, and then Traytors playd; Destroyers are destroy'd, Traytors betray'd. Another Song. O night, O day, while dayes and nights shall last, 'Bove all the dayes and nights that ever past, To Englands God be hallowed, With hearts and tongues solemnized, With Hymns and songs eternized. Black night and direful day, thou shouldst have been, A thundring night, a stormy day I ween, With hellish Tempests darkned, With Romish murders bloodyed, With English horror dismalled. The Train was ready laid, the powder dry, Faulks, and the blow, I quake to think how nigh. Now all the Fiends of Hell wide gap'd. Now all the friends of Rome well hop'd, Now all England securely slep'd. But Gods all-seeing never slumbring eye, As Sentinel kept watch and ward on high, Their devillish Plots he fore-espyes, Their Popish Miners he discryes, Gives King and State deliveries. Thus Hell and Rome have England twice assay'd, With force and fraud t' have conquer'd and betray'd; Their Navy first God scattered, Their Treason next discovered, And twice hath us delivered. 'Mongst years let eighty eight be Chronicled, 'Mongst dayes, Novembers fifth be Calendred, To God let both be hallowed, With hearts and tongues solemnized, With himns and songs eternized. For all, of all, God praised be, With hearts, tongues, lives, be honour'd he, Amen, Amen, Amen say we. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">OTHER POEMS BY JOHN WILSON A FRAGMENT OF A POEM ON THE DEATH OF SAMUEL DANFORTH, AN INFANT, 1653 What if they part with their beloved one, Their first Begotten, and their Only Son? What's this to that which Father Abram Suffer'd, When his own hands his Only Darling offer'd, In whom was bound up all his Joy in this Life present, and his hope of future Bliss? And what if God their Other Children Call, Second, Third, Fourth, suppose it should be All? What's this to Holy Job, his Trials sad, Who neither these nor t'other Comforts had? His Life was only given him for a Prey, Yet all his Troubles were to Heaven the way; Yea to far Greater Blessings on the Earth, The Lord rewarding all his Tears with Mirth. A COPY OF VERSES Made by that Reverend Man of God Mr. John Wilson, Pastor to the first Church in Boston; On the sudden Death of M?. Joseph Brisco, Who was translated from Earth to Heaven Jan. 1. 1657. Not by a Fiery Chariot as Elisha was, But by the Water, which was the outward cause: And now at Rest with Christ his Saviour dear, Though he hath left his dear Relations here. Joseph Briscoe Job cries hopes. Anagram. There is no Job but cries to God and hopes, And God his ear in Christ; to cries he opes, Out of the deeps to him I cry'd and hop'd, And unto me his gracious ear is op'd: Doubt not of this ye that my death bewail, What if it did so strangely me assail: What if I was so soon in Waters drown'd, And when I cry'd to men, no help I found: There was a God in Heaven that heard my cry, And lookt upon me with a gracious eye: He that did pity Joseph in his grief, Sent from above unto my soul relief: He sent his Angels who did it conveigh Into his Bosom, where poor Laz'rus lay: Let none presume to censure my estate, As Job his Friends did stumble at his Fate. All things on Earth do fall alike to all, To good Disciples, which on God that call; To those that do Blaspheme his Holy Name, And unto those that reverence the same: He that from nature drew me unto Grace, And look'd upon me with a Fathers face: When in my blood upheld me to the last, And now I do of joyes eternal tast. Remember how Job's precious children Dy'd, As also what the Prophet did betide: Jonah What was the end of good Josiah's life, And how it fared with Ezekiels Wife: Remember what a Death it was that Christ (Suffered for me) the Darling of the highest; His Death of Deaths hath quite remov'd the sting, No matter how or where the Lord doth bring Us to our end, in Christ who live and die And sure to live with Christ eternally. THOMAS SHEPARD. Anagr: Ã´ a map's thresh'd. Loe her's a map, where we may see Well thresh'd an heap of corn to be By Thomas Shepard's happy hand Which from the chaffe pure wheat hath fan'd: The wheat is the Church-members right (Both great and little ones) to witt Unto the seal of Baptisme, all That are within the Gospel call; I mean Believers and their seed; To whom the Lord hath Promised, To be their God; and doth reveal Their right to 's Covenant and the seal: On whom through Grace the Blessing came Of his dear servant Abraham. Be they or Jewes or Gentiles, now No difference the Lord doth know. The promise is to us and ours, As large, or larger: and God pour's His Spirit now as much, or more Then e're he did on them before. And if that they were Circumcis'd Then we are now to be Baptiz'd: Our Babes must now no less then theirs Be seal'd (as of his Kingdome heires) Christ calleth them his little ones, And as his darlings He them owne's Denouncing against them a woe, That are despisers of them, who Offend the least of them, and such As do their interest in him grutch. Crispus, with Gaius, Stephanas, With others, were not all through Grace Baptis'd that of their Household were? And Children who will doubt were there? Then let us not to them deny, Nor seem as if we did envy The priviledge which God from heaven Hath through his grace and favour given. Nor let us limit his good Spirit In applycation of Christ's merrit: Whose bloud was shed for them, as well As those who them in age excell: If such be taught of God, who dare Deny, they his Disciples are? THOMAS SHEPARD Anagr: More hath pass'd More from this holy pen hath pass'd The Baptisme to defend Of Infants that Church members are (If well you do attend) Then any Anti-baptists can with solidness confute. I wish with all my heart that God will grant these labours fruit, As good or better then the paines by other Godly taken. That thereby all his precious Saints he would please to awaken. That none may any more oppose, with Zeal preposterous, The Truth which Gods most holy word commendeth unto us: That who were less convinced by this holy Shepard's voice, Yet in his Letter left behind they may the more rejoyce. He was a shining Light indeed, few other such are left, The Lord vouchsafe we be not by our Sinns of them bereft. And poure down of his Spirit more upon his Sons surviving; That will be more and more unto Truth's lovers a reviving. THOMAS SHEPARD Anagr: Arm'd as the Shop. Arm'd (as the shop of God's good word Doth weapons unto him afford) Defend's the right of little ones, Whom God in the Church-Covenant ownes The Children of his Church among, To whom his Kingdome doth belong, And therewithall the Seal thereof, Through his free Mercy, Grace, and Love. Yet are there some which them forbid (As once his weak Disciples did) To come to Christ, and scruple make, Whether thereof they should partake? But Christ was very angry for it, As for such Zeale he did abhor it; Oh come, said he, and welcom'd such, With tokens of affection much: As if that they and scarcely any But such as they might chalenge any Or part, or portion in his grace, (So did his favour them embrace) His Babes, his Lambs, his little creatures He call's them. As for such defeatures, Christ they defeat as well as them Whom they presume so to contemn. This holy Shepard is like David, From Lyon's mouth and Beare's who saved That little Kid; whom God did crown With great and singular renown: And so this Shepard hath (no doubt) A glorious crown his head about. For all his labours, (and for this;) In high and everlasting bliss. And as the Lord doth honour him (For Christ his sake) so his esteem Both is, and ought to be most rare, 'Mongst them who Christ his followers are: And oh how should we bless his Name, That on his Son he powr's the same Good Spirit that was in the Father Or doubles it upon him rather: LORD these Epistles do thou bless! And as thy Truth they do confess So make them precious in the eyes Of all that do thy Gospel prize. Amen JOHN WILSON Senior Anagr. 2. JESU! ANNON THRONOS? Johannes Nortonius. Anagr. 3. ANNON JESU HONOR SIT? Annon dandus honor sit at omnibus omnis Jesu? Est quibus in Jesu sanguine parta salus? ENGLISH. OH Iesu! hast not thou prepared Thrones For us thy poor and ill deserving ones? How should we then to Thee all Honour give, And to thy Name, who in the Heav'ns dost live, And there preparest Mansions for thine, Where they may all in endless Glory shine? To the same purpose. John Norton. Anagr. INTO HONNOR. From Honour into Honour go (the Lord thus calling thee) To higher Honour, then there could on Earth obtained bee. Heav'n is the Seat of Honour for those whom he Crowns with Grace; For the most honourable Crowns, Heav'n is the onely place. By men that are most ignorant of Gods revealed Will, Thou may'st be miserable thought; for so they construe still (Like bruitish ones) the minde of God if Saints die in a swoon, As if their Sun, all bright before, Were now gone down at Noon. As if their case were now by farre the more to be deplor'd, As that which doth but little hope (or none) of Bliss afford. Yea, holy Job his Friends to this did too-too much incline, [That sudden Changes, such us his, do argue Wrath divine.] But when the Saints do perish thus (as foolish men conceive) That is the time, and means whereby more Honour they receive, As being Crown'd with Royal Crowns which are at Gods right hand. Like Joseph from his Dungeon rais'd by the Kings Command. 'Twas a translation marvellous which did Enoch remove From out this sinful world, to be crown'd in the Heav'ns above, Where now he lives, &amp; reigns, with heaps of highest honour fill'd, All his Predictions to be from time to time fulfill'd. An unexpected death did seize on Jobs posteritie, But in the Heav'ns a glorious Lot for them prepar'd did lie. Moses and Aaron when as they had suffer'd much, were bid As 't were, before their time to die (as in their Mounts they did) What if the Land of Canaan they might not visit? yet A place more glorious in the Heav'ns they, both of them, did get. In flaming-fiery-Charet wrapt from earth Elijah was, And by the same convey'd he was unto his bliss-ful place. Be it that good Josiah were cut off with suddain stroke, He dy'd in peace, and unto rest eternal was he toke. No funeral to Sion was as his so lamentable, Yet was his death as well as life to him most honourable. Theirs was the griefe, the joy was his. God highly honourd him, Although his death to carnal eyes might miserable seem. The cursed executioner cut off John Baptist's head, But how did Jesus honour him both when alive, and dead. The Crowned Martyr holy Stephen in cruel wise was ston'd, But by his blessed Saviour's most sweet imbraces own'd. Yea, Christ himself, Gods own dear Son, whose death more woeful was Yet from his cross how soon advanc'd to that most glorious place! So God his Christ with honour crown'd; So Christ doth honour his, To whom Gods Honour, and his Christ's, most dear and precious is. And such an one our Norton was whose death we so lament, Whose whole desire was upon Christ and on his glory bent None can deny it good nor bad, like as to Samuel They all were forced to confess he had done all things well. If any one should have an heart with envy fill'd so much As unto him his honour due, malignantly to grutch Yet this will adde unto the weight of his most glorious Crown, And both in sight of God and men increase his high renown. Tis true: he was a man, and none himself abhorred more; But none did more the Lords free grace in Jesus Christ adore. Nothing but this, to know, or preach, or share in did he wish. This was on Earth, as 't is in Heav'n his blessed Paradice. To Honour Christ, he was content as well by Sea, as Land, His Life to venture, yea his ALL, was All at Christ's Command. The care of all His Churches-dear lay heavy on his heart, As he did ever, but at last, most fully it impart. His life was nothing but of death a daily meditation, And to his happy end, at last, a solemn preparation. He was a man (if any were) that loved truth, and peace, Which to promote, in every kinde he ne're at all did cease. An Orthodox Divine he was (his writings all do show,) Both Englands, Holland, all the World, or do or may it know. His books do Antichrist confute with all his viperous brood, Especially where they eclipse the merits of Christs blood. Church-holy-order he maintain'd against Morellianisme, Decrying every sect, but most abhorring Quakerisme. His last both words, and works (like Davids) were the best And as his death more neer approach'd more lively then the rest. Nothing, but things at Gods right hand, and heavenly Mansions Was in his thoughts, at home, abroad, breath'd in's expressions. Ipswich was happy, Boston more, (if it we had but known) Whom two such Johns successively God gave to be their own. But John and Paul, so much admir'd (and most deservedly) Must be content to be abas'd by some, before they dy: And being dead, it will appeare such Prophets once we had, When God hath once abased us with changes very sad. The Lord, if his good pleasure be, our miseries prevent, And of our great unthankfulness grant that we may repent. Then will the Lord this Widow-Church, that widows house relieve, And make us all rejoyce again whom now he makes to grieve. We griev'd him first, and just it was that he should grieve our hearts, Though when at low'st we are, tis far beneath our just deserts. I speak of all New-England, but chiefly of Boston Church, Oh! let us all impartially our wayes and spirits search; And say as the Disciples did, Lord, is it I? is't I? And thou, my soule, beyond the rest It to thy self applie. Tis thou hast sinned: were there none, but thy unworthiness Well might the Lord both thee, and all, because of thee, distress. When such green trees, as were those Johns Gods hand thus spareth not, Of such a dry and withered one Lord what will be the lot? However we must bless thy name (what ere of us become) That thou takes up such fruitful ones to thine eternal home. Oh! that their rare Examples wee to follow had the grace! That thou may'st count us worthy once of that most glorious place. As for his Mary, let her say, [Rabboni] unto him, Who calls her [Mary] by her Name, and did her Soul redeem. Iohn Wilson Sen.</field>
