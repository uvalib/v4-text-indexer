      <field name="fulltext">TO HENRY. Henry! though with thy name a nobler verse, Of theme heroic, or devotion's prayer, Might fitlier blend, and more inspire Than these low, halting strains, and lead the way To more sublime emotions and entrance The listening city or the landward town, That spots afar the toppling mountain's base,â Still let thy name here stand, of one the name, Who to no meaner service, nobly walked, Than virtue's service! Who, by his virtue, Might compel, from even a reed so low, Or a weak life consumed in trivial thought, Spent on the tricks of show, on time's reprieves, Fate's half-forgiveness for forgotten deeds; Might still compel from this dull-sounding reed, In some strange moment truant to its jar, One note of music that might touch the stars, O'ercrown oblivious eras of long night. And so, half live. Be, then, to me a muse, And while the day roars downward in the dust Of crowded cities, and afar on seas Uplifted rifts the tall hoar billows, Mid its surge (surge all its own), the blast,â May I pursue, with thee, thy peaceful walks; O'er the low valleys seamed by long-past thrift, And crags that beetle o'er the base of woods, Which lift their mild umbrageous fronts to Heaven. By rock and stream, low hill and surly pitch Of never-opening oaks, let me essay, To teach their worth, meed of a poet's life. Yes! be to me a muse, if so, that thought Which is in thee, the king, that royal truth Spurning all commonplace details of lie,â All far-fetched harrowing curb-stones Of excuse, that fit men's actions to their Consciences, and so achieve content At the expense of honor; all low hopes, Apologies for self where weakness hides, And those worst virtues that the cozening world Pimps on her half-fledged brood; old shells and worms That saw ere deluged Noah at the plough,â If so, e'en in its faintest radiation Thy abiding faith in God's great justice Might arise, and so might I be just, And trust in him! For chiefly here, thy worth,â Chiefly in this, thy unabated trust,â Ample reliance on the unceasing Truth that rules the nether sphere about us, That drives round the unthinking ball, And buds the ignorant germs on life and time Of men and beasts and birds, themselves the sport Of a most healthy fortune, still unspent, So that all individual sorrows Butts for jest, leap down the narrow edge Of thy colossal wit, and shattered hide, There, at its base. Modest and mild, and kind, Who never spurned the needing from thy door, (Door of thy heart which is a palace gate); Temperate and faithful, in whose word, the world Might trust, sure to repay, unvexed by care, Unawed by Fortune's nod, slave to no lord Nor coward to thy peers, long shalt thou live, Not in this feeble verse, this sleeping age, But in the roll of Heaven; and at the bar Of that high court, where virtue is in place! Then, thou shalt fitly rule, and read the laws Of that supremer state, writ Jove's behest, And even old Saturn's chronicle, Works ne'er Hesiod saw, types of all things And portraitures of all, whose golden leaves Roll back the ages' doors, and summon up Unsleeping truths, by which, wheels on Heaven's prime. NEAR HOME. Still burns at Heaven's gate thy golden torch, All-conquering Sun, and in thy flame at morn The wearied nations rise; thyself, unwearied, Urging on the year, and pouring down thy fires On the delicate flowers, that still trusting ope Their little half-shut bells. Above us far The painter of the dark floods her cold light Across the dewy meads, with the still stars Companions of her coil. So the first day, Had burnt both sun and star, so burnt, so cooled, As now they lend a virtue to our fields, Where slow thro' modest valleys creep the streams, Nor leap to cataracts. So, to the first, They spoke in kindred voices, and compelled Just admiration. And, to the last, If e'er the race die out, they still may speak, Thus, in an outward dialect. Of this, We phrase not here; neither how from their seeds Sprang out the progenies of things, and rose To haughty empire or commanding state. On the low hills that skirt the River's side, Where feebly waves through half-felt joy the grass, Couched at their frugal cheer a savage host Held banquet high, nor doubt not in their ire, Here smoked forbidden dainties, though the fire Lit by the white men had not scorched their wits. How silent all! save the lone Sandpiper, Whose plaintive call a little echo stirs, When on the brink he idly plagues his mate. Soft sways around the Spring's consoling air, And up the sallows, like a distant camp, The never-ceasing hum of bees; birds soar, And gay the insect tribe flit in the beams Of the low-falling orb. I do not walk alone; For still I feel thy arm is round me, And thy law above, Thou, who art all in all,â Whose goodness guides, whose truth endears the whole, Without whose presence what were all to man, Save a far clouded gleam of deepening night. I do not walk alone, for still the Spring Calls up my old companions; and I see The old familiar faces: once more hear Notes that I once had heard, touches of joy, Beyond all words of mine expressions glad, Thoughts linked to brightness, and joys twined with joys, So that the far-off chimneys, as they rear Their tall unmoving pillars to the sky, Permit from their broad roofs sweet in the sun, A solace in their hospitable thoughts, Intent on home. That was my thought, my Home! And those dear memories that with thee build, Like youth's first love throned in unfading light. For like this Spring's soft sunshine, like the kiss Of this first sunlight, like these smiling hours, That never seem to bid farewell to day, Safe in my heart is home with all its joys; The blessed security of love that in one place There, I am truly loved; and there no thought Of usury upon the warm affections of the soul Ever may come, no blinding doubt, no frost, But in the laughing faces of our kin, Glad in the children dear and matron blest, And trust that knew no bane, we so shall live, So die,âthen gathered to our graves. And see, How quietly the dimpling river laves, Safe in its pure seclusion, the green base Of yonder hill, bleached to its core with shells, Things of the Indian, who, in this retreat Bent their small wigwams, when the spring's first thought Jetted the shad up from the usurping sea, And taught them near to lay their numerous spawn. Gone, like those leaping fish, that Indian tribe, Falling like autumn leaves drift o'er the soil, Where, for unnumbered centuries they chased The graceful deer, wild bear, and cumbrous moose. To thoughtful eye, their arrow-heads appear, Turned with the furrows of the farmer's plough,â Or pestle smooth, or chisel sharp of slate, And soap-stone pot, the heirlooms of a Race That owned these lands. So fared the fatal Indian, So decayed, so fell like grasses unrenewed, Down, where the white man builds. Thus drop the races, Annihilate and spoiled, not to return. Yet at their base the dimpling river laves, Base of these low, lone hills. The blackbird's trill Calls up his dusky mate, from the stiff twigs Of copse, the Button-bush that brings no leaf As yet, and on his wing the stripe of flame, Darts like a crimson meteor o'er the blue. On floating logs grave tortoises enjoy The watery dream, for hope returns, to all,â The everlasting hope returns with Spring. Save that the Indian bow no longer twangs Along the meadow, nor his watch-fires light The lonely tresses of the ambushed wood, Even as for countless ages all pursue The same immeasurable round. Why fear The pangs of penury, the student's curse,â Or love abandoned when some victim's heart Tears up from thine its fibres, and so graves A wake of living anguish in thy soul? Why live and droop beneath the weight of woe, That unsuccessful effort piles o'er pride, Half measuring its strength, thence prone to earth Hurled by self-accusation? Could not thou, Leagued with the universal law pursue Like it, a sympathetic journey; Nor fail thy sunshine to the sun, as he Ne'er to thee fails; bud as the laurel buds Deep in the hidden swamp, like the pinxter Hang flowers along the edges of the wood, Where save the savage hunter none delights, Or the green bittern brooding from the light?â Alone, deserted? then art thou alone, On some near hill-top, ere the orb of day In early summer, tints the floating heaven, And far around thy sleeping race endow With their oblivion the dim village roofs; Nor yet the wakeful herdsman folds his kine So to prolong their hours? Alone, then listen hushed! A living hymn awakes the studious air! A myriad sounds that to one song converge, As the added light shows the far hamlet And the distant wood. These, are the voices Of the unnumbered birds that fill the sphere With their delicious harmony, prolonged And ceaseless, so that at no time it dies, Vanquishing the expectation by delay. Still added notes, from the first Robin's 'larum On the walnut's bough, to the Veery's flute, Who from the furthest deep of the wet wood, In martial trills rallies his liquid lay, And the blithe whistling Oriole pours his joy. O! mark the molten flecks along the skies That move not, floating in those rosy heights Of clear celestial radiance, so far pure That not the artist in all color skilled, The English Turner, faintly them could picture. Yet not this color, not these lovely forms, That chiefly should engross and ask thy praise; Rather the revelation of abiding grace Continuous, as the morning's voice Lifts up the chant of universal faith, Perpetual newness and the health in things. This, is the startling theme, the lovely birth Each morn of a new day, so wholly new, So absolutely penetrated by itself, The fresh, the fair, the ever-living grace,â The tender joy, that still forever clothes This orb of Beauty, this, of bliss the abode! Therefore, fling off poor slumberer, thy dark robe Woven of night, ungird the dream-claspt brew, And freely forth exulting in thy joy, Launch out and taste the dewy twilight hour, Come ere the latest stars have fled, ere dawn Perfectly seen, unveil the outlined charm Of bosky wood, deep dells, and odorous copse, Where blazed with more than gold, some slow-drawn mist Retreats its distant arm from the cool meads! Forth, forth, and see what thou hast never seen, Nor thought, nor in thy wildest fancy touched, The charms of earliest life, the act of Love, Still in each day repeated, when from the dark And sleeping chaos sprang all fair, proud forms. To even express in faintest hints this birth, This resurrection of the buried earth, This weaving of new garments in an hour For our else naked orb, her fairest moment In the whole long day, must fail the wariest hand. Yet what these few faint touches may convey, Be that conveyed. Is it pure morning light, And dewy dawn within thy soul upheld, Who, from the world retired beholds the day, Creep with slow fingers from the utmost verge Of the remote horizon; notes of joy, Do these prelude within thy thought new life, When the thick cloud of being veiled in dust, Drops its obscure concealments and renewed Shoots like the eagle to new-risen orbs, Far-spent upon the eternal cope? Or dost thou never soar, and feebly soiled With matter's low terrestrial cerements, Conceal by them that dawn which in thy heart, Gives prophecy of heaven? These thoughts not here; Our simple rustic garb for such befit not,â More that soaring bard, rapt to a sphere beyond Time's fallible. Rather, let us pursue The shaded path, that in the thicket ends; Where in the blueberry the Cat-bird builds Shapely of twigs his nest, and mewing near Proclaims his royal emeralds to all eyes. Here would the mischief-loving boy, a pest, Deal prompt confusion, dragging to earth, Remorseless as the fates, the frail design; Wreck in a moment the neat finished house, And with capricious finger smash o'erjoyed The oval of the egg, short funeral! Nor trust to lesson him, with brass his nerves Tight-twisted might appal whole decalogues. Time is the cenotaph of things, of men. Nature renews with touch incessant,âDeath,â Rears to decay, creates her round on round Of still rejected being, scaling heaven, To lay her vast perfection at its feet. Numbers and dates, shoals of existences, Myriads of ages to her hand are nought,â Absolute artist in her least design As in her greatest. With her rapid eye She steals with lightning dash from worm to man, Wriggles in the atom, walks along the brute, Still to extend her still-extending plan. Thou need not ask her, wherefore, why hawks In mad descent dash at the sparrow's brain, Or leaping pikes the little pikes engulf,â Why in the volley of the surging main, Man's fleets blow off like apples and o'erstrew The Alps and Andes of the sunken world? Not if she knew herself, where she was bent, (That some have doubted) could she e'er reply. Why should she answer,âthee?âor canst thou probe With thy perfection, the unformed expanse Of anxious fortune where thy being swims, Even if its elements league with eternity, And curvet on the blast sweeping the halls Of the remotest heaven; or if the cup Of thy existence vapours with the breath That filled the clay, whence sprang all living forms? With spines and veins, with hairs and nervatures, Joints and articulations, leaves and cells, She calls her varied creatures into space. But what behind the ever-changeful thought, If thus the checkers on her board arranged, With what intention deals she her shrewd game, And where shall man, feigning his ignorance To be in league with her, at last arrive,â Or is he but a leaf tossed on the wave Creative, one more joint to pass along To-morrow, to a meaner thing, a throw Of her wise finger, then displaced. Forbear! Such speculation idling fools admit, But in thy heart of hearts that truth discern,â God to no worm denies his saving grace, And in thy darkest hour of mental anguish, Before his throne fall humbled, there fall, With thy brief sorrow and thy infant thought, Let drop the penury of self, and pray That his true light that never set nor will Upon the meanest, may o'erbloom thy dust,â And heal the torture of thy narrow heart. How like a girl that into maiden glides The spring has melted into June! O how She dashed her May of life away, and tied Her long uncumbered tresses in these knots, These neat confinÃ¨d braids that gird her brow, Put off her girlish figure springing free, Her loose attire half-gathered to a plan, Soothed her capricious form panting with play, And 'neath the trees her fair companions round Told them this charming tale to end the day. Could she not shout a little longer wild, And in her dark and roguish eyes proclaim The graver secret, that the half-staid girl Carelessly cool reserves, when on her tongue, As if a breath would from its tip, throw off The sudden meaning? There's no stay to life,â We thought to pause on May, to hold the world One moment to itself, to keep her fast, One long long joyous day, all Spring, and lo! The foliaged June sways her soft drapery O'er the waving mead, smiles in the grass, And pranks Senecios on the side Of the consumptive ditch. Yet the Rice-bird, From the murky south come speeding fast, Flings from his yellow crown a pulse of heat, And if the Blue-bird and his mellow trill, (A kind of joy half-uttered) brings the year, The hardy Bobolink profuse of notes O'erflowing, deluges the liberal air, Exuberant, as if his compact frame Could not contain his sounds, but in his pang Of never-ceasing melody his throat Too rash distended, might defect and end By one intense crescendo all his strain! So, it is fabled, that in contest, rare, The ambitious nightingale expires, her power Crushed by some instrument that to man's touch, Volumed a nobler music. On every hand Now wakes an insect world, raised from close sheaths, Strange transformations and unnoticed silks, Spun in low marshes by imperial worms. Their scaly lances on the wood-path dash, Glittering like men-at-arms, the Dragon-flies, Nerved to the core, and Whirligigs in maze Weave their continual circles o'er the pool With their dusk boat-like bodies, things of joy. Nor fail to note the thick EmpheridÃ¦, That dance along the stream, food for a tribe Almost as countless of quick-leaping fish. The Swifts on cutting wing dash through the swarm, And the familiar Swallow, poet birds. There are no poor in Nature; only man, And mostly he who lumbers in the train Of the commercial city, pride of power, Where from low allies and thick reeking lanes The putrid mass of slow corruption breathes, Infests the air, and with its sallow host Spawns ragged children for as ragged sire. Yet man, with his strange ills, deems himself first,â Lord of the world, and calls the orbs his own, Because with artificial eye he sweeps their round, Poor phantom of an hour, graved in the dust; While bee and beetle his interment make, And even the owls from some perpetual oak More stately and ancestral piles inhabit Than all his short-span race! But yesterday, Our fathers pulled their boats ashore and touched The rock, and now we are an empire, free,â So free, so utterly free, that never, No, not in Rome's barbaric hour, when slaves Of lust, were garnered in from all her lands, Did such a base and cruel wrong e'er soil The purple of her conquerors, as spots The unstained ermine of these blood-dyed States. I speak of Afric's wrongs, unnumbered wrongs! So that the summer o'er their wretched huts Wakes but a fiercer fire of wild revenge, And shrivels up the mind that rightly sees, How yet that desolation must ensue, Fruit of long-chosen sin that could be shunned, But would not! Not on the high road, not in dusty cars Loud-thundering o'er their iron vertebrÃ¦, Where in close boxes sweltering with the speed Nod in newspaper dreams the broadcloth world;â Nor with capricious haste of foaming steeds, Essay thou, rather along the river's smooth Untenanted domain gliding in peace, Steal with soft fancies in a silent bark. On every side the green contrivings wave, The friendly Willows nodding all their plumes, Carved Arrowheads and Calla broadly-leaved, And burr-reed spined, nor slight the floating orbs, Anchored companions of thy moving thought, The life of lilies, where the Nuphar's disk In richest yellow floats its gold repose, And smaller yet as brave, the Kalmian buds. O holy rest, O ripe tranquillity! For who shall dream in what uncounted years, These realms of peace e'er bent at ruin's knee, Or when that primal burst, the ancient chaos Racked these courteous aisles? Rather the arches, Where the King-bird rears his grassy throne, And strikes the nerve-fly, strong in tyrant-pride, Amply excepted from the general roar, When in the whirling war all seeds of things Together mixt, shook to their base old empires,â These soft scenes, wholly at peace still smiled, As now they smile, and took the sunsets In their peaceful arms and rocked them sleeping. Here, thing eternal, day begins not, ends not! And the night stealing half-ushered in, Steeps in the trembling wave her pillowed stars, Or with pellucid silver tints the wake Of the retiring moon, when from her couch She half withdraws, like some faint nymph Flushed by the hunter's horn, her bath profaned. Time nowise here, her rapine wakes, nor save The spray-voiced toad or bull-frog deep, whose music Half-finished, e'er it folds the ear, The weary question of the living bears. Nor can you here, voluptuous worldling, Flaunt your silken train, nor in your gay And Cleopatra-barges bear away The old simplicity that breathes in things Nought but the solitary fisher comes, More like a weedy tuft than living man, Lest he should lose his finny prey, And half-concealed along the green copse side, Or on the shore unmoving calmly spread, Mimics the maple-stump and core of soil. Strange fisherman! whose highest aim may soar To whirl the pickerel on the grassy bank,â With watery shoe unconscious of a leak, Or hot rheumatic thrill or opulent gout That rides the turtle-lord and shrieks his knell,â Thou seem'st to own this world, and to despise The lesser fry who dart about thy lines. So that the brassy court-bell dinging clear, Or whirr of engine-wheel, or news from wars, Where o'er Crimea's fields the Tartar horde Pours a red freshet on the Saxon steel, Cannot distract thy cane-pole;ânot old Greece And all its pale, departing history, Or that in later days they dream Rome was, Or nearer conscious England, Shakspeare's tomb, Thee worry;âso bite the fish, thy conquest. Nor think his strange morality, a jest, Superior beggar! who in Court or Church, With braying tongue and curt suspicious eye Demands romantic homage! think him not, This ragged fisher, 'neath thy empty state. What more hast thou, Life, Death, the Infinite, Above unbounded Heaven, beneath old Earth, And may be less repose of mind than he, More aching emptiness, not more content, And far more self-deception. If it stood So that the aspiring crowd, who with their pride, Declare their thoughts are nice, and coax them down, Lay o'er these fields long roads, proclaim club law, And summon lesser virtues to their thrones,â If these were all, if camp and church were all, And broadcloth might decapitate green baize, Then truly we were doomed, and life a dungeon. With these clerks for bolts, into one slumber All the social train softly might fall, And creep supine beneath their awful knees, Adore their wit, and pray the newspaper To intermit one afternoon, next year, for sports. But while the fisher dreams, or greasy gunner Lank with ebon locks shies o'er the fences, And cracks down the birds, game-law forgot, And still upon the outskirts of the town, A tawny tribe denudes the cranberry-bed,â Or life remains, we still shall sign, that Time Is not all sold like grains to the forestaller;â Still that we, even as the Indian did, Clasp palm to nature's palm, and pressure close Deal with the infinite. Thy estimate? And wherefore is that thine, my moralist? Or lays her eggs along the sandy shore The painted Tortoise by thy section one, Or on the naked oak long by the blow Of splintering lightning leafless, does our bird The white-crowned Osprey read thy paper code, Sauce to his pouts? And who shall scale the Heaven, And with his microscopic eye Discern, wherefore the Laurel pale adorns The deep-set swamp fenced by declivities And sombre woods, where the fierce Hen-hawk screams, And Screech-owls rear from dusky egg the young? Why not in trim parterres or shaven lawn, Or the gay sunshine of the grassy meads? Flowers of humanity! do ye too ope Your soft attractions in the lonely shade, Where the deep sphagnum coats a spongy soil, And the old spruces hung with lichens gray, Strive to outlast the annals of our race? Thou didst not carve the flowers, Philosopher! Thou, nor thy creed, thy saws, or reasoning forms, Bred in the lazaar-house of Thought, and shade Of tedious questions, dull and pale, fungi Of the Understanding, mere type of Fruit. O rather learn of the lone laurel, learn To intermit unprofitable shows, And harbor God's retirement in thy soul. Then, let us read in June, Boccaccio's stories, Told in gardens fair hard by Firenze's walls, And Shakspeare's mind, here we shall dedicate To a new purpose, vowed to ampler homage. Now, let us renew our vows to all delights, That grow from noble roots, enhance the day, And turn its passing glories to high purpose.â She cannot fail us, nature cannot fail, God's just expression through unrivalled form. And if the shallow worldling may not join With our true reverence for God's noble works, Thoughts of religion, still let us endue The transitory moment with that bloom, That on the fruit of Paradise shows purple,â Color unfading, tint of cloudless skies, Sapphire and amethyst of burnished spheres, That ope their crystalline beyond Time's grave. He shall not mock us, ne'er shall he deceive,â Nature's progenitor, who from the first, O'er all presiding still reneweth all! I see Rudolpho, cross our honest fields, Collapsed with thought, cool as the Stagyrite At intellectual problems; mastering Day after day part of the world's concern. Still adding to his list, beetle and bee,â Of what the Vireo builds a pensile nest, And why the Peetweet drops her giant egg In wheezing meadows, odorous with sweet brake. Nor welcome dawns, nor shrinking nights him menace, Still girt about for observation, yet Keen to pursue the devious lanes that lead To knowledge oft so dearly bought. For ne'er Can nature give her secrets without toil, And long inquiry and an anxious heart; So that Rudolpho, like the midnight watch, With eye and ear each strained to their full tension, Thought and feeling bent keen on one purpose, Who wonders that the flesh declines to grow Along his sallow pits, or that his life To social pleasure careless, pines away In dry seclusion and unfruitful shade? Martyr! for eye too sharp and ear too fine, Hero of facts, who fills his pouch with all Such life can furnish to a surface-fly, I must admire thy brave apprenticeship, To these dry forages, if the worldling Laugh in his sleeve at thy compelled devotion, And declare, an accidental stroke Surpassed whole Ã¦ons of Rudolpho's file. Press out the cream of learning, cast away The nicer sensibilities that fret The o'er-passioned heart, and eat thy crust Of brown unleavened dough off platters pine, Wherewith a grosser cook might light his fire;â Dust off the film of flattery and ambition, Drown old conventions in thy acid wit, Nor leave a peg whereon to hang the times! So shalt thou learn, Rudolpho, as thou walk'st, More from the winding lanes where nature leaves Her unaspiring creatures, and surpass In some fine saunter her declivity. Why beats that court-bell on the liquid air Of June's translucent prime, what caitiffs hold Base trials in the smug design of wood, Where sallow prisoners haled from grated walls,â Dark cells and close confines of misery Blink at the open daylight unconfined, Or callous to their doom demand contempt? Was it for this, he grew, yon thick-browed Murderer In his mother's arms, nurst in her road-side Cottage 'neath old elms, umbrageous place,â And there his boyish days brought to the lore That liberal nature shares amid the poor,â Gave to a parent's heart its pulse of joy, Bade elders smile to mark his urchin trick, Promise fair for virtue; and for this, he Walked along the adult's path and took Another to his side as wife and friend,â To end in this, felled in the dust ere dead? Driven by the slave-whip, in dark passion's power, He struck his bosom friend a murderous blow, And now where's human sympathy? Will one Lament, when the dread sentence from the mouth Of some oblivious Judge, slow-falling, shears Away ere dead, his once delightful form? Yes! still in another heart, he lives, a life Incessant; a simple girl, bride in her soul, Wears faithfully her crown, and fears his name Lest on his children's ear its presage fall. And should not jar the ear that brassy peal, Summoning these fearful woes to human hearts? O rather would I hear in murmur slow, The dying cadence of some funeral bell, With melancholy echoes far That lapse to silence, for the good man's soul, Who, after a long life of righteous deeds, Now has laid down the burden of his age, And fitly summoned to his fathers, sleeps With them, along the green hill-side. Such peal, Methinks, need not disturb our dim retreats, The depth of shaded forests robed in night, Or the true faces of the upland hills, Where nature wears even in her winter shroud A look of joy, and calm content, unfading! Let me hear that solemn-stealing bell, And pause a moment in the whirling tide, That bears me headlong on to the still regions Where our fathers sleep, and reign o'er silence; Let me reverence their lives, and so prepare My soul, for higher duties. If thy heart, Pained by humanity, desire retreat, This, thou may find and undisturbed secure, Near the calm bosom of the inland pond, For storms too sheltered and for forms too free, Where no vexatious villa greets the eye, Or blazing chateau proud with whited walls. Here, save the lone Kingfisher rattling o'er, Belted with blue, and half an azure wave, Or the great Northern diver, laughing bird, Saluting with her lonely peals the shore, Nought thee shall trouble; here thou canst repose And dream away the pains of ardent life, Forego ambition and the world's applause, Stretching along the bank, fanned by the wind That even in summer heats, from the cool surface Quaffs a breath of life, forget thy madness, Thy contriving wit, that made thee stoop To things beneath thyself. Around, the woods Lift up most ample canopies; old Pines, Yellow with spendthrift lichens, whispering groves Where youthful Birches frolic in their prime, And ever-graceful Maples with light leaves That turn the zephyr's kiss. Nor fail to mark The distant vision of the Hill-top blue, Where through the trees a vista opening far, Lets in a line of landscape on thy thought, And shows its moral by a fairer scene, More beautiful with distance. No palace, Rich in all Italia's art, e'er showed Like this calm pond, a store of rivalries. As if resolved, to outdo the bank, The tranquil wave reflects in its deep bosom, Or sleeping rock or soft and shaded hill, More perfected than in their real shape. So Nature plays the artist and defies Human ambition to surpass her skill. Here, sometimes gliding in his peaceful skiff ClimÃ©ne sails, heir of the World, and notes In his perception that no thing escapes, Each varying pulse along Life's arteries, Both what she half resolves and half effects, As well as her whole purpose. To his eye, The stars of many a midnight heaven Have beamed tokens of love, types of the Soul, And lifted him to more primeval natures, Than adorn the lower sphere. He saw In those far-moving barks on heaven's sea, Radiates of force, and while he moved from man, Lost on the eternal billow, still his heart Beat with some natural fondness for his race. Kind egotist, who still pursuing Art, Turned with a half-felt joy to lesser things! In other lands, they might have worshipt him, Nations had stood and blocked their chariot wheels At his approach, and cities stooped beneath his foot! But here, in our vast wilderness he walks Alone (if 'tis to be alone), when stars And breath of summer mountain-airs and morn, And the wild music of the untempered sea, Consort with human genius, for his soul,â ClimÃ©ne's soul leagues with these sources, These informing depths, and his pure mould Was laid, in the great sunshine, of the universe. O could not thou revere, bold Stranger, prone To inly smile and chide at human power, Our humble fields and lowly stooping hills,â Yellow with Johnswort, bright with Blue-eyed grass, When thou shall learn that here ClimÃ©ne trod, Here thought and from these modest surfaces Plucked fruits of Hesperides. Who are the great? They, who compose the current of the state,â War's conquerors, radiant with rapine, Bleeding in their seats so that the longest peace Can never still their memories, or they Who build leagues of oblivion and their tombs, Commercial cities! fettering the poor; Or noisy babblers, in the weary halls Where legislation crowns her acts with wind, Or far beyond, Mechanics, who displace Aged exertion with inventive skill; Or rather he, whose Thought girds in the whole, And like a sentinel on the outpost of time Challenges Eternity and bids it speak? I know not, let the world decide; but life I feel, is never spent in vain, that leads Man to revere himself and so his aim, Be to rise higher towards the social good, And so exalt at once with him, mankind. But if these July fervors sere thy brain, Parch up thy heart and turn thee to a coal, Then, rather seek the Sea's capacious verge. There, stretch at length upon the ocean brink, On some all-crowning headland, while the wind Blows cool from off the bay, renew thy strength, And coping with the element itself Enjoy the exhilarating bath. Vigor and pulse shall animate thy frame, Caught from the wholesome perfume of the main, New life and new emotions linking thine To the vast spaces of the untrammelled deep. Survey the sliding sands, that down the bank Ever precipitate, next snatched away By ceaseless waves, so lead a moving life, Now for a little fixed to mother earth, Then sweeping far, erect new shoals whereon The hapless Mariner his chart revoked, Sleeps his perpetual sleep! The tide-wave, Whose strange vigor rolls the breaker onward, Knows no pause, no halt, ever renewed the same, Curling transparent to long lines of foam When softer airs dally with summer hours, Next hurled in surges like a cannonade, Where worlds in contest join, battles the coast, Tossing the ship a pebble in its palm. Strange creature, unsuggestive element! Forever from the mind that cannot fix Thy form in horizontal grandeur vast, Still without likeness, swept; I see the ships, A never-ending company desert Their places, onward, out of sight, and feel That were it not for what there is of life, Of human life and human hope in them, But for thy freshening airs, consummate Sea! And endless beauty and provoking change, Thou wert a lonely waste. And yet I link With thee, fathomless Ocean, that dear child! A summer child, flower of the world, Rosalba! for like thee, she has no bound Or limit to her beauty, framed to spell Words that the gods might copy; Venus-zoned She rather, like thy billows, bends with grace. Nor deem the Grecian fable all a myth, That AphroditÃ© from a shell appeared, Soft spanned upon the wave, for o'er thy heart, Unheeding stranger! thus Rosalba falls, And by one entrance on thy privacy Unrolls the mysteries, and gives them tongue. Dearest Rosalba! could a clumsy hand Or paint or shape thy image, thou, who art Not only fair but good, not only good but true, Not borrowing from artificial plans thy virtue; Rather, like the sun that all things warms, Life in thyself, breath of humanities That take their rise from milky natures, Soft and fine and pure, refined so far Beyond all touch of art, or word of praise, That an interior sunlight tones thy days To one profound contentment. O my child! Child of the poet's thought, if ever God Made any creature that could thee surpass,â The lightest sunset cloud that purpling swims Across the zenith's lake, the foam of seas, The roses when they paint the green sand-wastes Of the remotest Cape, or hour ere dawn, I cannot fathom it; how thou art made, How these attempered elements that in the mass Run to confusion and exhale in fault, Beget all monstrous passions and dark thoughts, Or slow contriving malice or cold spite, Or leagues of dulness self persuaded rare, Or old delusion in the maiden's breast,â Should rise in thee like the vast ocean's grace, Ne'er to be bounded by my heart or hope, Yet ever decorous, modest and complete. Forgive me, O most beautiful, if I have sinned, If e'er one feeling in my heart had place, To link thee to myself! Forgive this song, That here presumptuous I should name thy name, Or feebly dare to celebrate thy charm! Rose on her cheeks, are roses in her heart, And softer on the earth her footstep falls Than earliest twilight airs across the wave, While in her heart the unfathomed sea of love, Its never-ceasing tide pours onward.â Yet if those high and echoing shores thee please not, Seek again the tranquil river's bank. July evokes new splendor o'er the stream, In dulcet figures and diviner forms. Yet more than all the Water-lily's pomp, That star of creamy perfume, born to be Consoler of thy solitary hours. In vast profusion from the store of pads, They floating rise, with their fine beauty decked, The habitation of an insect host, That here pursue and steal the core away. Nor slight the Pickerel-weed, whose violet shaft Completes the tall reed's beauty and endows With a contrasted harmony, the shore. No work of human art could faintly tell, Much less repeat in words or colors, all The unnoticed lustre of these summer plants, The floating palaces of anchored orbs, And spikes of untold beauty crowning earth, Where save the lonely sportsman or some soul Wandering from heated life and sick of toil, No creature glides of human shape. Yet here The Muskrat swims, and pout and perch display Their arrowy swiftness, as the minnows dart And break the filmy surface of the pool, And the high-colored Bream, the fish of gems, Their circular nests scoop from the yellow sand. Nay, do not ask why was this beauty lavished On these spots, do not believe that love in vain Is poured upon the solitude, nor deem Absence of Human life, absence of all! Why is not here an answer to thy thought, Contriving man, rearing the court-house, Or rich pulpits lined, or deemest thou the charm Of endless beauty might not thee avail, More than a stuccoed wall where pictures hang, Or rattling street, or state and camp, and town. Or mark in August as the twilight falls, Like wreaths of timid smoke, the curling mists Poured from some smouldering fire across The meadows cool, whose shadows thrown So faintly, seem to fall asleep with day! How softly pours the thin and curling mist! Now shall the eye half lose in it all faith, As it were but the mockery of the brain, Then if it gather denser own its truth. O twilight world! abode of Peace, how deep Might we not envy him who in thee lives, With that same quietness that lives in thee; And like thy soft and gently-falling beauty His repose,âdreams in the flood-tide of the world. Alas! I fear but few who walk these streets, That wear as deep tranquillity, Poor slaves of fashion and the prints of form, Or simply frivolous if first youth gild An aimless brow with pleasure, or the dupe Of little weak successes, that deceive Their shallow owners, martyrs to mere cant, If cant it be, to not perceive their vice. And yet those nobler souls, whose hopes were wrecked On some remote mischance, remote in time, But nearest to their hearts. Forbear such themes; For now the upland Pastures draped with green, Invite us to that pleasing task unsung, The Berry-field, where in a frolic chain Knit by gay industry, the healthy band Of bounding children go, and glean the grain That ripens without cost, to laboring steer, Or dim domestic horse, the farmer's butt. Not olden CrÅsus in imperial wealth, Nor the bright jewel-chambers of a crown Famed for barbaric conquest, pulled from Ind Wreaths for its queen, like these unnoticed moors, Pregnant with Blueberries whose colors mock The overhanging sky, all turquoise gems! Not that Vitellius wooed or Horace sung Praise of Falernian, or delightful mead In Chaucer's time no mythus, could now win From us a single sentence, while we pluck The abundant fruit adapted to the hand, And place and hour, while slowly o'er the hills The unnerved day piles her prodigious sunshine. Here, be gardens of Hesperian mould, Recesses rare, temples of birch and fern, Preserves of light-green Sumac, Ivy thick, And old stone-fences tottering to their fall, And gleaming lakes that cool invite the bath, And most aerial mountains for the West! Italy and Greece? and would ye fly to them, Poor, rash, deluded travellers, art and fame That they have built afar their gilded seats,â Capricious children, in our berry-fields, That bound the horizon's verge from where Ye sit, near by at ease, here be your shrines! With but a glistening pail, an honest hand, And thought that loves the air and heart at home, Ye safe may laugh at those poor foreign lands, Where dilettanti apes go clad in weeds, And ruined temples rear their weary moss. What leads our people, children of this land, Born in New England, in New England bred, To shun their native shores, and with sad eyes Rehearse on Tiber's banks their homesick woe? Here, where old races linger in the soil, (The aspiring Indian elder to them all, First in great Nature's heart), and where the scene Is all a long and beautiful delay, To round a finished life and steep the blood In temperate pleasures, why should Egypt be And her colossal mummies such a joy? Or dusty Babylon where Arabs howl, Or China's torpid teas, or English tombs. May God forgive me! I had rather be, The meanest worm that haunts our berry-fields, Than wear the purple on those distant thrones, And love far more the breath of Liberty Across our poor, uncultured, sandy soils, Than all the crumbling empires in their shrouds. The wealth of Penury!âscant phrase indeed!â Yet to be poor is ever the true wealth! Poor to the worldly eye, and those who swim And glitter in their pride cannot aspire To the deep blessing that the Poor man knows, Lord of himself, and health, and simple tastes. And all our youth rush out to feed on whims, Fashion craves their hours, low hopes their aim. To win not noble women for their brides, But titled slaves heirs to some teasing caste, And beauty without culture seems mere show,â As if great Nature laid not on her tints With more contrivance than the brush of art, Or schools where grammars bide the place of sense, And shallow stammering drowns the native voice. Here, in these shades, these deep seclusions hid Beneath the whisp'ring leaves and o'er our moors A ragged independence lives at ease, Wearing those good adornments of the race, Such as pure air, warm suns, and builds the Hero Urban pens describe. Such have I seen, Men to whom palaces might bow in vain, Inferior to themselves; whose hearts and hands Conjoined with Nature love the earth they smite, And while they tease the globe for rye and corn, Give still an hour to junketing and sport. So walked our fathers, when the English braves, Who deemed they owned the land our fathers tilled, Flush with red jackets, marched along the bank Of this slow River creeping to the sea. And said, doubt not, because the tide was slow, The rustics on its banks had hearts as slow. Then rang their shot and echoed through the Manse, Scaring the red-wing, but that noon's brave hour,â That little hour America endowed With shores that bound Pacifics, wilds that touch Base of the Rocky hills and prairies far Where the fierce bison stalks, the Pawnee's game. They came up from their ploughs; they fired their guns; Crushed out the host of England, yet tame slaves, And while grave queens and lords still on their necks Weigh an usurping heel, our fathers' sons May worship God as they list, and choose their best Or worst to govern, as they will. Brave shot! That echoes far across the wide St. Lawrence, And India's depth of jungle, tigers' lair, And fitfully o'er Westminster and Scotland's hills, Though many a shot has scared the red-wing since, Time and the men made of that ringing gun The knell of empire, Freedom's best salute! O why so soon, most princely Golden-rod, So soon,âwhy yesterday all summer, Now, thy nodding plumes convert our hopes To Autumn, and endow the verdured lanes With thy most royal gold? Yet like all wealth, Thou hast a cold and hidden sorrow in thee, As to say, Behold in me a flattery! Think me like an ebbing of the tide, When purer splendors o'er the curling wave Seem down its long declivity, to glide. Ye too, meek Asters, violets' late friends, Pale tranquil constellations of the fall, That mark a decadence, why do ye strew Your fair amenities along the paths Of these continuous woodlands, come so soon? Ere half the flush of summer's rosy hours Had lit the faces of the August hills, Decked the broad meadows with their base of grass, Forced Indian corn to flint, or ere the brood Of the first April birds put on their dress. Not mournful; no, the world, whate'er its sorrows be, Will not disclose them. Silent and serene The plastic soul emancipates her kind, And leaves the generations to their fate, Uncompromised by tears. She will not weep,â She needs no grief for man, our mother Nature! Is not rude or vexed, or rough or careless, Out of temper never, still as sweet, though winds Of Winter brush her leaves away, and life To human creatures, breathes like frost. Dear friend! Learn from the joy of Nature, so to be Not only quite resigned to thy worst fears, But like herself superior to them all. Not only superficial in thy smiles, For down the inmost fibre of thy heart Let goodness run, and fix in that The ever lapsing tides, that lesser thoughts Deprive of half their patience. Be throughout, Warm as the inmost life that fills the world, And in demeanor show thy safe content, Annihilating change. So Vernon lived, Considerate to his kind! His love bestowed Was not a thing of fractions, half-way done, But with a mellow goodness like the sun, He shone o'er mortal hearts, and brought their buds To blossoms, thence to fruits and seed. Forbearing too much counsel, yet with blows In pleasing reason urged, he took their thoughts As with a mild surprise, and they were good, Even though they knew not whence it came, Or once suspected that from Vernon's heart, That warm o'er-circling heart, their impulse flowed.</field>
