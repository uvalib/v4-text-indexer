      <field name="fulltext">My Mind AND ITS THOUGHTS, IN SKETCHES, FRAGMENTS, AND ESSAYS; BY SARAH WENTWORTH MORTON, OF DORCHESTER, MASS. “I stood among them, but not of them— “In a shroud of thoughts, which were not their thoughts. RUSTIC LINES, UPON RETURNING TO THE BELOVED HAMLET OF DORCHESTER Home of my heart! thy tranquil scene Of plains—in early herbage green; Thy near hills bordering bold and wild, The temper of thy breezes mild— Thine ocean blue as beauty's eye, And calm as clouds bright hovering nigh, Ere twilight breathes her parting sigh. On—the brisk gale, when mid-day clear Wakes the first floweret of the year, Bending as if that gale to greet, Like captive at her conqueror's feet! While the tossed waves exulting seem To love the sun's approaching beam.— These all are mine—ere the young day Warms in the bashful blush of May. Thy vernal bird, with song of glee, Recalls thy fugitive to thee; The rustic tones of truth to find, The smile, that speaks the welcome kind; Or the quick eye, which seems to say, The steps of labour must not stay; To all I come—for all are dear To her, whose whole of life rests here. Sweet Hamlet! since no wrong invades The quiet of thine elm-row shades, I come—beneath those shades to rest, And in that quiet to be blest. Sweet Hamlet! to thy breast of bloom In singleness of soul I come! The aching of my cares to hide, And dead to all that breathe beside. For in thy bounties thou art kind, To the world-wearied nerve of mind; And most to her who dares not own, How much she feels in crowds alone. ODE TO MERCY. Bless'd Power! first attribute of heaven! Whose melting eye, And accent bland; Whose gentle sigh, And open hand, Were to the best beloved of mortals given;— Whither, ah whither, hast thou fled, On what soft bosom rests thine angel head; Or to what distant wilds are thy mild graces driven? Thou art not in the courtly smile, Which silken Gratio wears, Whose softness flatters to beguile, Whose kindness but in voice is known, Round whose dark mind's degraded throne, Falsehood her doubly forked sting with serpent venom bears. Still further from the rough disdain, Of rich Lorenzo's pride; He who in trilling arts excels— Critic in flies, in flowers, in shells; Which o'er his hollow heart preside;— And shut his marble breast to sorrow's moving strain. Nor art thou with the vaunting tongue, Which in misconduct's tortured ear, Proclaims each pity-giving tear, Which virtue's sorrowing heart bestows, When folly leads her train of woes, And scorpions lash the voluntary wrong. Oh shade of Howard! still to thee, Meek offspring of humility, That this true philanthropist was among the most humble and self accusing of mankind, is evinced in his letter, written in positive rejection of the statue, that had been ordered for the purpose of commemorating his inestimamable services; in which letter, disclaiming all merit, he deprecates every tribute. The living muses wake their grateful strain— Howard, to sorrow self-resigned, Howard was a man of sorrows, and thence devoted and sacrificed his life to the children of suffering. Whose firm, undaunted, sleepless mind, Embraced the extended family of pain; For that to heaven he raised the expiring eye, With that he deigned to live,—for that he dared to die. Howard died of a fever, the infection of which was communicated by a dying individual, who requested to see him, and in complying with that request his own life was sacrificed. Does the hard earth no living spot disclose, Where pity's weeping floweret blows, Pouring her balm of blessedness around, Scenes where the sick in heart, and lost of hope are found? Philos, William Phillips, Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts, at once modest and munificent, pre-eminent among the first in every deed of mercy. This true Samaritan some time since released all the debtors under close confinement within the walls of the County prison, by paying the amount of demands brought individually against them, by merciless or necessitous creditors. to thee unwearied mercy kneels, Not for thy rank, nor wealth, thy deeds alone! Deeds which the powerful heart of misery feels, Deeds of thy secret soul she calls her own; Deeds at whose touch the prison'd debtor smiles, His dim eye lighted by his fervid prayer; The blessing, which his agony beguiles, Is poured on heaven FOR HIM whose great reward is there. Angel of earth! whose steps in silence move, While scattered bounty through their pathway blooms, More grateful are the breathings of thy love, Than all the generous summer's rich perfumes, These to the sense luxurious sweets impart; Those come like incense to the fainting heart. Mercy Divine!—though grief severe May rest her fang of misery here, To me thy tearful smile will seem, Like the young morning's dewy beam Cheering the gloom with promise mild, A foliage mid the desert wild, Wherever the thin and stunted palm trees are visible amid the Arabian deserts, the blessing of a spring of sweet water is expected and obtained. A bark the desperate wretch to save, Who struggles with the stronger wave; A light like that the apostle knew, When back his prison's portals flew, And the soft touch of angels lay On chains, that touch dissolved away. A blessing sought, and sent and shed On earth—when earthly hope is dead. Beloved of Heaven! thy healing aid impart, To charm and change the deeply venomed heart, Give the fix'd bosom, cold as hardest steel, To move, to warm, to soften, and to feel. Rewarding each awaken'd sense With the rich blessing of thy own Benevolence. LINES TO POVERTY. Oh Poverty! hard featured dame, Whence grow the terrors of thy name? 'Tis said that from thy serious eye, The laughing train of pleasures fly. That deep within thy mansion rude, Lurks the black fiend, ingratitude. That toil, and want, and shame are known To make thy heartless hours their own, 'Till guilt, his phrenzied eye on fire, Bids the last famished hope expire. Thus speaks the world,—to mammon true, While wrongs thy pleading worth pursue; To me—and I have seen thee near, Though harsh thy withering look appear; Though stern the teachers of the poor, And hard the lesson, to endure, Yet many a virtue born of thee, Lives sundered from prosperity. Religion, that on heaven relies, The moral of thy mind supplies. —Pity, with plaintive accent, kind, And patience, to her fate resigned; Are seen thy lowly cot to share, While temperance dwells an inmate there. Love joined by truth—no rival's eye Wakes to the wish of poverty, But all the blest affections twine Round many a rustic home of thine. Close circling with the nuptial tie, Joys, which a monarch could not buy, Though boonless, and to praise unknown. Oft is the lustre'd life thy own: To thee, the priests of God belong, And thine the Poet's deathless song: Thee, toiling science lives to claim, Thou lead'st his thorny steps to fame. Creative genius feels thy power, Coeval with his natal hour; On him the rays of glory shine Too late—his parting breath is thine. Let me thy simple glances meet, Near the green hamlet's calm retreat; Not where the city, throng'd with sin, Bids all the monster crimes begin. Thence will thy timid virtues fly, Scared by seduction's serpent eye. Their fate, each murdered hope to see, While every suffering lives to thee. Not that along the wintry shore, The fisher plies the wearying oar, Not that amid the sultry plain, The peasant piles the laboured grain, Wilt thou with frowning brow appear, To wring the grief-extorted tear. But when to wrongs thy sufferings lead, While shame, and false reproach succeed; When genius, doomed with thee to mourn, Sees his unsheltered laurels torn. While ignorant malice, rushing by, Quick glances with insidious eye. When all thy cultured virtues move, Nor sense to feel, nor heart to love; While treachery under friendship's guise, Bids the pernicious rumour rise, Still aiming with envenomed dart, To reach the life-pulse of thy heart. Then Poverty, hard featured dame, We feel the miseries of thy claim, Would from thy close embraces fly, Or in their palsying pressure die. SOUVENIR. During the endemial ravages of the spotted malignant fever in the state of Maine, the active benevolence of one man was known to meliorate the distress, and to preserve the existence of hundreds of human victims. To that man, the compassionate friend and beneficent physician of the poor, the following lines were inscribed by ONE OF THE GRATEFUL. For him, “The Man of Ross”—your boast prolong, Who love the Poet and the Muses' song. Lives there, whose deeds an equal homage claim. Yet shuns the tributary breath of fame, To pale disease, and paler misery flies, His dread the question of enquiring eyes. He, born to bless, with secret step draws near Where the proud sufferer drops the silent tear. Where hard and deep the frost of fortune lay; Pours light and life, like heaven's restoring ray: Or where the murmuring poor by wants oppress'd, Claim the large bounty of his ample breast, Is known to loiter—till the bursting prayer, Tells his touched soul a pitying God is there; That prayer the rescued innocent shall raise, With eyes that speak unutterable praise. Do hoards of wealth this bounteous stream supply? Ah! when could gold the richer feelings buy. See the vain Midas, grasping mid his store, Wait till the prosperous gales have wafted more. While he who breathes to shelter and to save, Repays his heaven the portioned boon it gave. Lives there—like him, by Britain's bard defined, A man of melting heart and matchless mind; Who flies the grateful fame that would pursue? “Did good by stealth, and BLUSHED to find it fame.” Thou, Vaughan Benjamin Vaughan, of Hallowell in the state of Maine, whose ample fortune is expended in deeds of mercy; and whose medical science is exerted for the preservation of those whose only remuneration can be by blessings and prayers to heaven, where his best treasure is, and his heart also! wilt “blush” to find the semblance true. TO GEORGE HENRY APTHORP. My Brother! at youth's vernal hour, Thine was beauty's transient flower; My Brother! in life's summer day, Thine is of mind, the enduring ray; From blushing morn, to noon's decline, Of soul and heart, the strength is thine, Soul to sustain, and heart to cheer The pilgrim's path of darkness here. To me thy deeds of kindness seem Expressive as the patriarch's dream, When to his lightly slumbering eyes, Angels from earth were seen to rise On steps Steps, rather than ladders, according to the original Hebrew. celestial—bright and fair, As hope had brought her bounties there, While on his sense the vision grew, The golden gate of heaven he knew: And Jacob said, Surely this is the gate of heaven. Holy Scriptures. Thus to the mourner's musing eyes, A passage brightening to the skies Is seen from earth—an angel's care Unfolds the portal's blessing there. LINES TO THE MANSION OF MY ANCESTORS, See the end of the volume. This Mansion, as enlarged and embellished by its honoured proprietor, the late Charles Apthorp, Esq. was then, that is, about the middle of the Eighteenth Century, said to be the scene of every elegance, and the abode of every virtue. Now, its beautiful hall of entrance, arches, sculpture, and base-relief; the grand stair-case, and its highly finished saloon, have been removed, or partitioned off, to accommodate the bank and its dependencies. ON SEEING IT OCCUPIED AS A BANKING ESTABLISHMENT. Mansion! no more by beauty graced, Thee have the spoiler's hands defaced. Mansion of yore! thy stately dome, Seem'd of a polish'd world the home. The NOBLE Lord Amherst, and Sir Peter Warren, commanders of the then army and navy, were not only received at the generous ball and banquet, but also to the continued hospitality of the Mansion, during their temporary residence in Boston; the honoured proprietor being pay-master to, and contractor for the royal army and navy. there were nobly led, And at the generous banquet fed; While the Crusader's shield The shield of the Apthorp arms, which bearing a mullet or spur, in heraldry, with truly Welsh prepossession, the family were fondly, perhaps foolishly, wont to trace back to the Crusades. was seen, To tell of deeds that once had been. How art thou changed! and mammon's store Proclaims the reign of soul is o'er! The feast, the dance, the song of glee, No longer of thy NAME nor thee. Apthorp! most dear, most honoured name, A parent's boast, his children's claim, Thy halls to taste and talents known, Where all the brilliant bounties shone: Thy sons approved in arts or arms, Thy daughters of transcendant charms Are gone—and Plutus builds a throne, Enriched by fortune's gifts alone. Even where the curtaining velvet rose, Round the calm midnight of repose; Where my proud father's In this Mansion, the father of the author, with seventeen other children, were born; sixteen of them at the particular request of the noble guests, were permitted to pass through the well peopled and well furnished apartments. Those children, all, and without exception, healthy and handsome, have perished, and for the most part, before the meridian of their days. infant eyes, First saw the beauteous morning rise, Proud, with a Cambrian's boast to claim The warrior's and the artist's fame; Proud, in his matchless form to trace The impress of an honoured race, But prouder in his gifted mind, The genius of that race to find. All, all are lost— Not one of their numerous descendants remains, who was in existence before the death of the venerated parent, and to tradition alone are we indebted for this memorial of true excellence and generous hospitality. The beautiful mother, also of Welsh origin, was grand-daughter to Sir James Lloyd, a name which even to the present day, has preserved its pristine honours, unsullied, and undiminished. Finally, the author presumes to hope that her Lines to the Mansion, will not be attributed to pride, or any self-sufficiency whatever, but rather to feelings of true filial piety, and grateful commemoration. the bright, the fair Are gone—and wealth is worshipped there The children's children live to see Nor memory of thy name nor thee, No mansion by the grandsire trod, Nor hill, nor vale, nor grassy sod, Stay with the race—their only claim The riches of his treasured name: Not one of all survives to tell How fond his glance of blessing fell: Fame only lives in cold decay; For time has borne the bloom away. LINES TO THE BREATH OF KINDNESS. The following lines being, as their style imports, a production of early youth, are here inserted, not surely for poetic merit, but rather for the grateful sentiment at that period felt, uttered, and inscribed TO THE KINDEST OF THE KIND. Truly these childish Lines were not then seen by the individual to whom they were inscribed in very early youth. Sweet is the garden's breeze that flows, With health and sweetness from the rose; Charm'd was the strain Cecilia knew, And with enrapturing finger drew; So sweet the breath which kindness moves. So charms the voice attention loves: She, with the organ's lifted peal. Could make a listening Angel feel, With floating wing from heaven descend, And o'er her fine attractions bend, In the legends of the saints, it is written that saint Cecilia, the inventress of the organ, drew an angel from heaven by the melody of that divine instrument. To thee a finer strain is given, A strain that wins the heart to heaven. What time the breath of kindness steals O'er every pang that sorrow feels; With all affection's hoarded stores, How rich the balmy whisper pours, Rich as the spring's first blossom blows, Warm as the lip of summer glows; Sweet as the morning's clovered vale, And healthful as its zephyr'd gale, More prized than wealth; than worlds more dear; Still may that whisper loiter near; Still to this trusting heart reveal, What only thou—LOVED FRIEND! can'st feel. LINES INSCRIBED TO A CELEBRATED HISTORICAL PAINTER, UPON HIS RETURN FROM GREAT BRITAIN TO THE UNITED STATES. Not Raphael—that these lowly lays, Can reach the summit of thy praise, That thou, the young Columbia's boast, The pride of Britain's polished coast, Can'st from the muses fragrant breath, Receive a finer, fonder wreath; Than that two rival worlds bestow, To grace thy fame embellished brow. But holier friendship bows the knee, To virtue, genius, and to thee. She, whose fair morn of life was new, When on that voice instruction grew, While every word a moral taught, And kindness won the wandering thought. She sees her early friend restored, With every worth her youth adored, Sees him, unlike the summer race, Who shun affliction's altering face; Still the benignant accent hears, Still finds that worth her soul reveres. Ah, Raphael! not the loud acclaim, And far extending voice of fame; Not all the joys THY ART can give, Not through the lapse of time to live. Not all thy patriot valour As a distinguished officer of high rank in the American Revolution. known, The light with which thy Parent The late Governor of a neighbouring state. shone! Can to thy bosom yield a good, Like thine own conscious rectitude. For me, by many a lesson taught, Of patient hope, the enduring thought; Oft have I met the insidious stare, The mean neglect, the enquiring air. Which shunning every kindlier part, Still probed the lacerated heart. While malice urged the shaft of pain, Have bid the smile of pity reign; And proud serenity controul The anguish of the indignant soul. Have seen the giddy careless throng, Melt at the sorrows of a song; While the mild stranger still supplied, That tear, known arrogance denied. In vain the searching mind has sought, For worth, mid folly's rude resort, And still with heart-exulting pride, Found TRUTH with GENIUS close allied. PRAYER TO PATIENCE. Calm Goddess of the steadfast eye, Thy coldest apathy impart, Since from a world of woe I fly To thee—O! take me to thy heart. On me descend with healing power, Assist me to suppress the groan, Or give me while afflictions lower, To turn, like Niobe, to stone. Let me to pride's exulting sneer, Oppose thy much enduring smile, Serene—when angry storms appear, Silent—if ruder words revile. Subdue the tyrant of the mind, Oppressive enemy of thee: Ah! who can hope or solace find, When racked by sensibility. Release me from her wearing sway, And shield me with thy firmer aid, Secure, when I thy voice obey; Gentle and peace-preserving maid. If greater pangs this bosom rend, Than ever bosom felt before; Still further may thy sway extend, And greater, deeper be thy power. Be every wrong disarmed by thee, Rob poor presumption of her pride, Bid malice at thy presence flee, Turn envy's venom'd shaft aside. Let false reproach some mercy feel, To mean neglect be kindness lent; From passion wrest his lifted steel, From dark revenge, his discontent. Power of the meek and silent eye, Surround me with thy placid charms; To thy calm graces let me fly, My only refuge is thine arms. CHARACTER FROM LIFE. IN REPLY TO THE QUESTION—“WHY DOES NO ONE LIKE WHOM EVERY ONE ADMIRES?” VARRO. With that commanding strength of brain, Which right and wrong obey, True to a voice whose forceful strain, Impels the will away. With beauty's blessing on his face, Eyes that with genius shine; Each well proportioned limb, a grace Which flattery calls divine. With wealth, whose still increasing store, Ten thousand joys might claim, Station, to taste the sweets of power, In honours, wealth and fame. Say, why does Varro live unblessed, Why not one heart commend Him? who of every gift possessed, But kindness and a friend. Not one to like, whom all admire, All praise, but none approve?— Though frost may wake the electric fire, It cannot kindle love. Cold is that dark and doubtful mind, Gloomed by the clouds of care, And colder to himself confined, The good that labours there. Thus winning to the dazzled sight, The polish'd marble shows, Fair as the pale moon's silver light, But hard as trackless snows. With warmth, the hard cold marble prove, It owns the kind controul; But what the stony heart can move, Or thaw the frozen soul! MAUDLA. THE CARELESS SINNER TURNED PERSECUTING SAINT, PARTLY IMITATED FROM THE FRENCH. When Maud was young, her deeds were bad, Of aged Maud the ways are sad; That sin which charmed her earlier eyes, Now from her hideous figure flies, And since that Satan tempts no more, She to her God unlocks the door; As if what tophet loathes and leaves, Heaven and its angel host receives, And ugliest sin were welcome there, Where all is good, and all is fair; Thus to the rancorous heart is given The hope of blessedness and heaven, Even as the cankering reptiles come, To where the peach unfolds its bloom: And from the veriest trash may rise, The bright carnation's fragrant dyes. The character from the French prose, and that which precedes it, were a task imposed on the author at the city of Washington, unappropriate, and certainly without the least intended personality. LINES TO JOHN C. WARREN, M. D. OF BOSTON, MASS. ? “Known, “Less by his father's glories than his own.” Warren! thy name to every patriot dear, Seems an immortal charm to genius given, In the bold annals of an empire famed, In the firm records of her wisdom, prized; —A star, whose path is glory—while on thee The rays descend, reflected and reflective. For thou hast nature's wealth—treasures of mind; Enlarged by every high and great endowment. Which culturing art, and lettered lore bestow, Even mid thy bloom of years; fruits ripe as autumn, And as the youthful summer's earliest ray, Bounteous—were seen, in life's fair morn mature As in the high and full meridian hour, Of manhood's bright and proud pre-eminence. Envied, admired, approved, but most beloved, Since all the sacred charities that bless, With every finer elegance, that lives In look, or form, or accent, are thine own. Behold the rescued victim of disease, Him, whom thy stedfast eye and powerful hand, Pitying, have pained, and saved through many a suffering. He, mid the moan of anguish, murmurs blessings, While ONE of mental malady the prey, She whose hurt brain, and ever quivering nerve, Invite THE GREAT DETROYER; she has hailed Thee, gentlest of the gentle,—not more prized For science, than for virtues, heaven awarded. Go on, and in the path where peril dwells, Meet happiness—that path by genius trod, Is strewed with honours—thy true heritage, But most enriched by thee—graceful and graced, In all the high nobility of nature. STANZAS TO MY LATE LOVELY AND BELOVED DAUGHTER CHARLOTTE, AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN. As round that pure unruffled stream, Which loves the lonely vale to lave, More rich the bordering flowrets seem, Reflected by the lucid wave: So, in the charms which deck thy form, The graces of thy soul we find; That blush, from nature's pencil warm, Is but the bounty of thy mind. That voice, which like the western breeze, With balmy health and softness fraught, Each animated sense to please,— Was from thy heavenly temper caught. And though thy bosom's sacred throne, The whiteness of the dove impart, Even that the critic stern must own, Is not more faultless than thine heart. The finished form—the speaking eyes, To sense and diffidence are due, While that their brilliant beam supplies, From this the modest graces grew. No longer then the lover train, Shall boast that blooming charms alone Can with despotic empire reign, And make the conquered soul their own: But gazing on thy perfect face, To all thy beauteous self resigned, Shall in that faithful mirror trace Each finer feature of thy mind. STANZAS TO DISAPPOINTMENT. Offspring of earth! whose sullen eye, Glooms with the still increasing care, Why throw thy mad glance on the sky! Why court the curse that hovers there. Whether of luckless love thy claim, To chill the warm heart's passion'd glow, Or under friendship's treacherous name, To strike the meditated blow. Or when ambition upward springs, Conscious of fortune's vernal ray, To clip the young hope's soaring wings, And snatch the tasted joy away: Whether on lucre's toiling train Thou turn thy hard and heavy form, While scorn redoubles every pain, That breaks the wearied spirit down: Or on retarded justice wait, Where slow Potomack's waters roll, Assume the answering nod of state, And reach the Georgian's harrowed soul: The Georgian.—Intended to designate that company of unfortunate citizens, who had been induced to purchase a large tract of country in the state of Georgia; which purchase being disputed as illicit, or illegal, the supplicants were seen every season, returning from the GREAT CITY on the Potomack, to their desolate homes, unanswered, and unrequited—for the most part ruined, ere partial redress was awarded. Still dreaded, and still dreadful known, Thine is the broad and phrenzied stare; And thine the deep and deadly groan, Which lead thy victim to despair. Has not thy coldly grasping fold, Strong as the serpent's venomed twine, Known this quick nerve of life to hold, Till every stagnant pulse was thine. Though wide as earth thy crushing sway, Child of the world! to that confined, One heavenly hope shall charm away Thy wrongs—and heal the suffering mind. Hope, kind preserver! angel power, Wilt thou the imprisoned spirit free! In disappointment's palsying hour, Turn thy electric glance on me. TO MR. STUART. UPON SEEING THOSE PORTRAITS WHICH WERE PAINTED BY HIM AT PHILADELPHIA, IN THE BEGINNING OH THE PRESENT CENTURY. Stuart, thy Portraits speak!—with skill divine Round the light graces flows the waving line; Expression in its finest utterance lives, And a new language to creation gives. Each varying trait the gifted artist shows, Wisdom majestic in his bending brows; The warrior's open front, his eye of fire— As where the charms of bashful youth retire. Or patient, plodding, and with wealth content, The man of commerce counts his cent per cent. 'Tis character that breathes, 'tis soul that twines Round the rich canvass, traced in living lines. Speaks in the face, as in the form display'd, Warms in the tint, and mellows in the shade. Those touching graces, and that front sublime, Thy hand shall rescue from the spoil of time. Hence the fair victim scorns the threat'ning rage, And stealing step, of slow advancing age. Still on her cheek the bright carnation blows, Her lip's deep blush its breathing sweetness shows. For like the magic wand, thy pencil gives Its potent charm, and every feature lives. Even as the powerful eye's transcendant ray, Bends its soft glance and bids the heart obey. Thy fine perceptions flow, by heaven designed, To reach the thought, and pierce the unfolded mind. Through its swift course the rapid feeling trace, And stamp the sovereign passion on the face. Even one, by no enlivening grace arrayed, One, born to linger in affliction's shade, Hast thou, kind artist, with attraction dressed, With all that nature in her soul expressed. Go on, and may reward thy cares attend; —The friend of genius must remain thy friend. Though sordid minds with impious touch presume, To blend thy laurel with the cypress gloom. With tears of grief its shining leaves to fade; Its fair hope withering in the cheerless shade, The well-earned meed of liberal praise deny, And on thy talents gaze with dubious eye. Genius is sorrow's child—to want allied— Consoled by glory, and sustained by pride, To souls sublime her richest wreath she owes, And loves that fame which kindred worth bestows. INSCRIPTION, FOR THE PORTRAIT OF FISHER AMES, PAINTED CON AMORE BY STUART. Such is the man!—inspired the artist wrought, And reached with soaring mind his flight of thought. Then bid the brow's reflective calm declare, Majestic honour dwells unquestioned there. Mild from that eye the rays of kindness flow, Warm on those lips the words of fervour glow, Yet with persuasion's pensive charm appear, To win the plaudit of a nation's tear. See his pathetic speech on the British Treaty, as published in his works. Sublime of soul! in speaking features shine, Feeling's fine flame, and eloquence divine. Such is the man; beheld, approached, approved! Born to excel—yet less admired than loved. SONG. WRITTEN AT “THE WOODLANDS,” THE SEAT OF WILLIAM HAMILTON, ESQ. UPON THE SCHUYLKILL. “How sweet through the woodlands,” in spring's jocund hour, To catch the first breeze which unfolds the wild flower. Adown the green slopes the rich landscape survey, Where Schuylkill prolongs his meandering way. More dear in that mansion's retreat from the plains, While rapture in silent expression remains. To rest where the arts and the virtues unite, Without, all enchantment, within all delight. Most welcome that face, so benignant in smiles, That voice, which the care of the stranger beguiles. Those graces, where genius combining the whole, On the features of nature imprinted his soul. All hail, ye fair scenes! and you, slow winding wave, As unwilling to quit the fond banks that you lave. Still heave your full bosom, where shining around, The altar of taste is with tenderness crowned. INSCRIPTIONS. Intended for a little Island upon the Schuylkill, belonging to the proprietor of the Woodlands; at whose request the following were hastily written. FOR A SARCOPHAGUS, ERECTED TO THE MEMORY OF SHENSTONE, BY WILLIAM HAMILTON, ESQ. While curious art and careless nature smile, Thy memory, Shenstone, claims this fairy isle; Seen like a gem amid the clasping wave, Where lavish'd wealth such emerald lustre gave, Thy muse demands! and kindred taste bestows, Haunts where the loves in shadowy calm repose. Or in the living blush of beauty shine, On scenes as graced, and hearts as charmed as thine. Each woodland warbler seems his groves among, To chaunt thy requiem in a richer song. While thy enamoured spirit, hovering near, Finds of thy life THE INSPIRING GENIUS here. FOR AN ARBOUR, OR RUSTIC SEAT ON THE ISLAND. Stranger, this green and graced retreat, Spreads all its wealth for thee, Be thine the richly pictured scene, Hill, valley, walk, and tree. Thine be yon smoothly winding stream, Whose silent waters move, Unruffled as a good man's breast, Reflecting heaven above. Or thine the tossing tide, so fond Its golden curls to raise, When touched by day's departing flame, It sparkling, seems to blaze. Thine, if by taste and nature won, These to thy glance appear In all the beauties genius gave, To plant attraction here. Hast thou a soul to feeling true, Stay, Wanderer, nor depart, A nobler gift meets thy regard, Even his, the Patron's heart. PHILADELPHIA. AN ELEGY. WRITTEN AT THE MOST DESOLATING PERIOD OF THE FATAL PESTILENCE OF THE YELLOW FEVER. Imperial daughter of the west, Why thus in widowed weeds recline? With every gift of nature blest, The empire of a WORLD was thine. Late, brighter than the star that gleams. Ere the soft morning carol flows; Now, mournful as the maniac's dreams, When melancholy rules his woes. What foe, with more than Gallic This Elegy was first published during the extirpating reign of the tyrant Robespierre. ire, Has thinned thy city's thronging way, Bid the sweet breath of youth expire, And manhood's powerful pulse decay. No Gallic foe's ferocious band, Fearful as fate, as death severe, But the destroying angel's hand, With hotter rage, with fiercer fear. I saw thee in thy pride of days, In glory rich, in beauty fair, When Morris The Honourable R. Morris, who from the indiscretion of individuals, and by the disasters of commerce, was compelled to exchange the hospitality of his superb mansion for the dreariness of a prison. partner of thy praise, Sustained thee with a patron's care: Have hailed that hospitable dome, Where all the cultured virtues grew, Fortune, and fashion's graceful home, Warm hearted love, and friendship true. Columbia's genius! veil thy brow, Angel of mercy! hither bend, The prayer of misery meets thee now, With healing energy descend. Chase the hot fiend whose SALLOW tread Consumes the fairest flower that blows, Fades the sweet lilly's bashful head, And blights the blushes of the rose. Even now his omen'd birds of prey, Through the unpeopling mansions rove, Have quenched the soft eye's heavenly ray, And closed the breezy lip of love. Yet guard THAT FRIEND, who wandering near Haunts, which the loitering Schuylkill laves, Bestows the tributary tear, Or fans with sighs the drowsy waves. And while his mercy-dealing hand, Feeds many a famished child of care, Wave round his brow thy saving wand, And breathe new freshness through the air. While borne on health's elastic wing, Afar the rapid whirlwind flies, The bracing gale of Zembla bring, And bleach with frost the blackening skies Where shelving to the heated coast, With frowns the dusky piles Water street, which in the original plan of the city, by its illustrious founder, was to have been laid out in plantations of trees, with regular walks, equally conducive to health and recreation. This benevolent appropriation having been anticipated by the speculations of avarice, this spot, as if in divine vengeance, has become the most fatal location of the pestilence. ascend, Bid some Alcides, freedom's boast, His heaven-assisted arm extend. Beneath his firm collected blow, Wasteful the cumbrous ruin lies, Till Dryads bring each breathing bough, And bid the green plantation rise. Thence the light poplar's tapering form, The oak his building branches rears, The elm, that braves the cleaving storm, The fragrant pine's prolific tears. While every leaf expands a shade, Beneath whose breeze contagion dies, Full many a youth and blushing maid, Gaze, grateful, with enamoured eyes. He, who the loved asylum gave, Even thus the PARENT-FOUNDER said,— Now whispered from the wakening grave, Ah! heed the mandate of the dead. And bid the Naiads bring their urns, Haste!—and the marble fount unclose, Through streets where Syrian summer burns,— Till all the cool libation flows. Cool as the brook that bathes the heath, When noon unfolds his silent hours, Refreshing as the morning's breath, And genial as are vernal showers. From waves the heavenly Venus grew, Those waves to mortal beauty kind, The flush of fragrant health renew, And brace the nerve-enfeebled mind. Imperial daughter of the west, No rival wins thy wreath away, In all the wealth of nature drest, Again thy sovereign charms display. See all thy setting glories rise, Again thy thronging streets appear, Thy mart an hundred ports supplies, Thy harvest feeds the circling year. STANZAS. TO THE HON. ROBERT LISTON, MINISTER PLENIPOTENTIARY FROM GREAT BRITAIN, UPON HEARING HIM AT HIS DEPARTURE, LAMENT THAT “AMERICA HAD NO POETS.” Though on Columbia's bleak uncultured shore, With languid step the ungenial muses rove, 'Tis her's, the bounds of ocean to explore, And with the spirit of THINE Albion move. Though not for her the stream of science flow, 'Tis her's the nobler virtues to command, To seek the gems of genius WHERE they glow, And deal her tribute with unsparing hand. Liston, 'tis her's with truth's enamoured eye, Like a near friend, whom fortune dooms to part, Still at thy name to breathe affections sigh, And wear thy graces graven on her heart. For thou hast wisdom to attract the wise, Temper, whose sun-shine with benignant ray Commands the florid smile of joy to rise, And bids the frowning storm of hate decay. An empire's glory claims thy filial care, While from thy dome the fiend of party flies, For all the amities inhabit there, And there the spirit of contention dies. Still may Britannia on thy genius smile, And still Columbia's kindred voice approve, Rewards await thee from the GLORIOUS ISLE, While younger nations crown them with their love. BATAVIA, AN ELEGY. WRITTEN UPON THE UNRESISTED SUBJUGATION OF THE UNITED PROVINCES TO THE FRENCH REVOLUTIONISTS. Degenerate race, ye lost Batavians, say, Where is the blood that warmed the patriot's veins? When in your great first William's glorious day, Invading armies fled the unconquered plains? Where is that spirit of your hardy sires, Which turned indignant from a foreign lord, And where that hope, a country's cause inspires, The stateman's virtue, and the warrior's sword? The swarthy Gaul now claims the willow'd meads, Where your famed fathers, patient, proud and poor. Stampt their bold annals with triumphant deeds, And learnt the trying lesson to endure. Ye sons of traffic! lost Batavians, say, Does the hard victor heed the captive's moan, Can the fierce wolf resign his trembling prey, Nor make the rich luxurious treat his own. Who calls the shaggy monarch of the wood, To yield the fleecy fold his fostering care! No more to quench his burning lip in blood, But learn with tasteless apathy to spare? Thus shall ye thrive beneath the victor's sway, And thus the fierce Exotic guard your coast, Who flung with careless hand, a prize away, Richer than all your conquer'd country's boast. Transcendant Freedom, offspring of the soil, Ne'er can an alien's hand that gem bestow, Whose brilliant rays reward the patriot's toil, Grace his bold front, and on his bosom glow. ELEGY. TO THE MEMORY OF MARIE ANTOINETTE, THE UNFORTUNATE QUEEN OF LOUIS THE 16TH, OF FRANCE.—WRITTEN IMMEDIATELY UPON HEARING OF THE EVENT OF HER DEATH. 'Tis past—the agonizing pang is o'er, And THOU, fair faded shadow of a queen, Shalt bend that supplicating eye no more, While spurning insult rears his ruffian mien. No more the sighing breeze of dawn shall bear, The sentenced murder to thy harrowed soul, No more the night, close curtained by despair, Bid the deep whelming flood of anguish roll No more remembrance to thy blasted view, Recal the morning of thy troubled day, When hope around the lovely landscape threw, Spring's changeless robe, and summer's cloudless ray. Set is thy star of life—the pausing storm, Turns its black deluge from that wearied head, The fiends of murder quit that bloodless form, And the last animating hope is fled. Blest is the hour of peace—though curs'd the hand, That snaps the thread of life's disastrous loom, Thrice blest, the great invincible command, Which deals the solace of the slumbering tomb. Let those whom long adopted sorrows own, On whom the cruel strokes of fate descend, On whom the happy race of mortals frown, And stern affliction strips of many a friend: Those who at Cynthia's melancholy hour, While the slow night-clock knells its mournful sound— Have waked to weep, with unavailing power, The cureless pang of many a mental wound: Let the wrapt mother, who, with phrenzied mind, Saw her last cherub feed the hungry tomb— Or her, whose heart its peerless lord resigned, And gave to cankering grief her vernal bloom: Let all who fondly clasp the form of woe, And boast that every featured ill is theirs, On Gallia's Queen one patient hour bestow, And turn to heaven with penitence and prayers. Did'st THOU, poor mourner, grace yon lilied throne, Fair as the youthful poet's pictured dream, While round thy days the light of fortune shone, And warmed a nation with its dazzling beam? Ah no—vain ingrate—nature's boundless page, On the chilled sense no equal horror throws— One dread example blots a lettered age, That scene abhorred, a polished realm bestows. What though affliction's petrifying sway, Has bid thy heart its kindling pulse forego, Has torn of life the vital hope away— And left thee as a monument of woe: Yet call the roses to thy faded cheek, With the mind's lustre light the languid eye, Cloathe the vex'd soul with resignation meek, And bid the labouring, lingering murmur die. Why should the wretch, upon whose visual orb, The Lord of brightness never poured his ray. Repine, when darkness folds her nightly robe, At the swift transit of the changeful day? Can the poor worm who clasps his speck of earth, While on his head the crushing bolt is hurl'd, Like yon bright offspring of celestial birth, Command the plaudit of a pitying world? Say, wert thou sent to fill this stormy scene, Freed from the icy touch of withering care?— Then think of loyal Gallia's worship'd Queen, And learn thy little drop of woe to bear. Ah then, thou selfish mourner, cease to grieve, If to thine heart one orphan hope remain, With grateful lip the precious boon receive, As the sweet solace for a world of pain. SONG OF THE RUNIC BARD. See Godwin's life of Chaucer. THE POWER OF MUSIC IS THUS HYPERBOLICALLY COMMEMORATED BY ONE OF THE RUNIC BARDS. “I know a Song—by which I soften and enchant the arms of my enemies, and render their weapons of no effect.” “I know a Song—which I need only to sing when men have loaded me with bonds; for the moment I sing it, my chains fall in pieces, and I walk forth in liberty.” “I know a Song—useful to all mankind; for as soon as hatred inflames the sons of men, the moment I sing it, they are appeased.” “I know a Song—of such virtue, that were I caught in a storm, I can hush the winds, and render the air perfectly calm.” IMITATION, IN ENGLISH VERSE, OF THE SONG OF THE RUNIC BARD. [1st.] “I know a Song”—the magic of whose power, Can save the warrior in destruction's hour; From the fierce foe his falling vengeance charm, And wrest the weapon from his nervous arm. 2d. I know a Song, which when in bonds I lay, Broke from the grinding chain its links away, While the sweet notes their swelling numbers roll'd, Back fly the bolts, the trembling gates unfold, Free as the breeze the elastic limbs advance, Course the far field, or braid the enlivening dance. 3d. I know a Song, to mend the heart designed, Quenching the fiery passions of mankind; When lurking rage, and deadly hate combine, To charm the serpent of revenge, is mine. 4th. I know a Song, that when the wild winds blow, To bend the monarchs of the forest low, If to the lay my warbling voice incline, Waking the varied tones with skill divine; Hushed are the gales, the spirit of the storm Calms his bleak breath, and smooths his furrowed form, The day looks up, the moistened hills serene, Through the faint clouds exalt their sparkling green. ODE FOR THE ELEMENT OF FIRE. COMPOSED AT THE REQUEST OF THE CHARITABLE FIRE SOCIETY, AND PERFORMED AT KING'S CHAPEL, BOSTON. Kind is the gift of fire! whose power Man, with restraining art, shall guide; Friend of his dear domestic hour, To all his bosom'd joys allied; While round his heart, with sparkling ray, It cheers the shivering stranger's dreary way Nor to the social scene alone, Does the bright element belong, Hence science claims her radiant throne, And bears her world of thought along: And hence mechanic arts arise, Inventive, useful, beautiful, and wise. And as to man's imperial kind Alone the charm of speech was given. Alone the clear, perceptive mind, An image of reflected heaven; He dares with ruling hand aspire, To wake and win the slumbering life of FIRE. Yet should, with wild unlicensed sway, The subject flame rebellious soar, No more that ruling hand obey— Friend of the social scene no more; Wide breaking with disastrous light, Portentous on the curtain'd calm of night: Around the wealth embellished dome, Bloodless the red destroyer flies; Nor spares the poor man's wedded home, Nor heeds the phrenzied parent's cries. Though on her wakening senses steal, All that a mother's suffering heart can feel. To soothe—to save—still hovering near, Rich Charity! thy cares extend, With kind, consolatory tear, And voice, like pitying heaven, descend And help the helpless—and impart Love that rewards—and hope that heals the heart. ODES TO TIME. These Odes, with trifling alterations, are reprinted from a former publication: being first written during the presidency of the now retired patriot, John Adams. ODE 1. Power of the sweeping wing! And wasting sand! Lord of the healing breath! And spoiling hand! Whose lengthened fingers fling The viewless shafts of death! Beneath whose tread the crumbling marble lies, From whose vast hoard unbounded empires rise: Yet rise to fall! While to thy sway and thee The sometime victor bends his conquered knee, And feels his palsied heart obey thy call; Whose grasp can shake the tyrant from his throne, And from his withering temples snatch the tarnished crown Magician! whom all arts obey, Now from thy wand is ruin hurled, Now a rude outlaw gains imperial sway, And a walled acre Alluding to the well known origin of Rome. awes the subject world. Thy talisman could Egypt's pillars bow, From their broad base her pyramids shall throw, While all her faded laurels shade thy brow. Egypt! from whom immortal hope The Egyptians were the first who asserted the immortality of the soul; the belief of which was clearly indicated by the doctrine of the Metempsychosis. arose, Beneath whose orient ray, Celestial science met the eye of day— Where bursting wisdom dawned its earliest beam, Ere on the margin of her worshipped stream Like a new God the young Papyrus grew, And taught instructed realms to lift the adoring view, While all the arts on his smooth breast repose! Egypt, where Alexander sleeps in dust, Where great Sesotris In all the countries subjugated by this extraordinary hero, he erected pillars or statues of himself with this inscription, “I Sesostris, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, subdued this country by the power of my arms;” and probably no conqueror has ever displayed so many monuments of victorious greatness. rears his trophied bust. A mouldering pageant and an empty name; While the barbarian Turk her meads deflowers, And the wild Arab mocks her murdered powers; Assisting thee to blast her fading fame: No more Osiris Osiris, the inventor of the plough, was worshipped under the form of an Ox, whom they denominated the God Apis guards those wasted plains, No pean'd Isis “I Isis, wife of king Osiris, am she, who found corn for the use of man.” strews the golden grains! Proud Xerxes wept to find That, ere one fleeting century sunned mankind, His million heroes to thy power must bow: Vain man! with all thy treasured radiance shine, Nerved with majestic strength—and graced with charms divine. None could be compared to Xerxes in Strength—In Beauty—and in Stature. Gillies' Greece. For the rough sea thy bonds prepare— Bid thy frail vassals lash the angry air— While thy delusive moments flow— And the great conqueror arrests thy care, Nor will his lifted scythe those vaunted honors spare! Where is Palmyra's boast! Where tower'd Zenobia's dome! Where the Chaldean, Syrian, Grecian host! Or where thy glorious freedom, LAURELLED Rome? Ask their great founder, Time— Whose plastic hand, Where ignorance led his vagrant band, In some unlettered clime, Now bids the marble of the palace rise, With glittering turrets to the bending skies, Adorned with infant arts aspiring to their prime. Even thus Columbia, o'er whose growing plains, Chief of her choice, her Great Civilian This merely required the name of John Adams, and is now rendered superfluous, by the previous notice of the Odes having been written during his presidency. reigns; Of guiding genius, and controlling hand, Firm to resolve, and gentle to command: Decided Patriot! Time for thee prepares A crown, uncankered by the rust of years; Haloed by stars, whose varying rays entwine: The gift is glory, but the grace is thine. While withering millions on far Europe's shore Gaze on thy rights, and all their wrongs deplore; From thee shall time the lettered precept give, Instruction flow—they drink the stream and live. O Virtue! sovereign of the gifted mind, Though erring mortals may reject thy sway, Those loved of heaven, the noblest of their kind, Are thine, and thine the light that leads their way, Opening on life's drear shades a MORNING RAY,— Thee shall all ruling Time himself obey! SECOND ODE TO TIME. Sire of the silver locks! to whom Creation's crowding myriads come! With pleading eye, and pouring tear, Besieging oft thy heedless ear; With adulation bending low, And smoothing o'er thy furrowed brow; While senseless age, with bleachened hairs, Demands a lengthened lease of years, From thee, flushed hectic looks for health, From thee, pale avarice grasps at wealth, From thee ambition dreams of boundless power; The prisoner waits thy aid to set him free, The Chymist yields his crucible to thee; And on thy wings the Poet hopes to soar. Even I, my vain petition raise, In all the melody of praise— But not for wealth, nor power, nor fame, Would invocate thy fearful name: Let wealth his joyless nothings keep— Ambition gain his world—and weep.— And on the chymist may'st thou pour Like fabled Jove, a golden shower: Still may the pining prisoner find, A Howard's cares have made thee kind. Nor would the lowly muse implore, Thy latest, best regard, Since from her grief-consoling power, Ascends each wished reward; But ah! thy sharpest scythe display, To sweep this shadowy form away, Ere cold the narrowing mind appear, And closed the portals of the ear: Ere age shall every glance controul, That speaks the language of the soul: Or even one anguish'd sense depart, Which rends the concave of the heart. Which bids each suffering fibre glow, To agony's excess, Or gives this raptured breast to know Reflected happiness. Ah! yet the sweeping scythe display, Ere these full locks have turned to grey, Ere this slight form to thee shall bend, O let me to the tomb descend! Then memory shall delight to trace, Some cherished worth, some fancied grace, While bending o'er the slumbering clay, Each conscious foible fades away. There oft shall friendship's gentle form be found, Heaving from breast of down the sacred sigh, And fondly spelling out the piteous tale, There shall chaste love his earliest woes bewail, To the cold marble cling with burning eye, Or wear with pilgrim-knee the insensate ground. So may fresh laurels deck thy faded brow, So may new realms thy ravaged fields adorn: O'er the dead desert living streamlets flow, And hope with carol'd hymn invite the morn: So may thine age regain its golden prime, When the charmed minstrel graced the monarch's board, And with the lamb reclined the forest's lord, “The Lion shall lie down with the Lamb.” While war's red triumphs from creation hurled, Peace leans enamoured o'er the awakened world, And not a tear-drop shames the eye of Time. DISINTERESTEDNESS, A FABLE. IMITATED FROM THE FRENCH PROSE. Avaro to the Rector flies; Why sleeps thy zeal, the usurer cries, Extortions stalk around; Their gripe the heir expectant drains, Their's are the venturous merchant's gains, By which the poor are ground! It is thy trade, returned the priest; The sharpest of thy kind: Thou should'st be merciful—at least, As thou would'st mercy find. Ah pray! sir priest, thy task attend, Nor let the growing tribe extend; No more my coffer feels its hoards, The exhausted field no grain affords, The springs of wealth are dry— Then with denouncing voice restrain, The NUMBERS of extortion's train, Numbers more rich than I. Let hapless me those curses bear, Which now an hundred usurers share, With hearts more hard than stone! We read, one sentenced he goat lost, Redeemed the sin sequestered host;— Thus heap the offender's crimes on me. I would the SINGLE victim be— Guilt, shame, and grasping profit—all my own!

Sweet Glove! when snugly packed you lay In dealers shop, and slept all day Close to your partner's bosom prest; —What new emotions fired your breast, When leading on the laughing loves, Philenia stopped, and asked for Gloves. When the reluctant glove she drew From off her hand, and tried on you. What transport through your system thrilled, When your distended form was filled, With beauty never, known before;— And touched with more than magic power; And ah! what rapture through you flew, When she replied—“Sir, these will do.” Since daily you her hand have prest, And nightly near her gone to rest— But soon alas! your joys are past— Extatic bliss can never last! For quickly you are doomed to know, That when you torn and worn shall grow, You—hapless elf, will be thrown by Neglected—in some corner lie, And see some glove all white and new, Obtain that hand so prized by you. To meet neglect for all your love, Is grief enough for hapless glove— But when stern fate shall add to this, That you must know your rival's bliss, And hopeless meet his haughty scorn; —What glove was ever so forlorn!— At last, in plaister, or in string, Or cleaning plate, your days may end; Who then will think that such a thing, Poor Glove! was e'er Philenia's friend! SECOND ADDRESS TO THE SAME GLOVE; INTENDED AS A RESPONSE TO THE UNAVOWED AUTHOR OF THE ABOVE. No—not in string, nor plaister base, But round some tall preserving jar, This glove, the luckiest of his race, Shall catch the Gourmand's glance afar! And all his envious passions move, The raspberry's luscious jam to greet, The ruby of the peach to prove, Or crab, as peach, or raspberry sweet. Or gooseberry—with its blending tart,— Or the plump cherry's scarlet heart, Which more than maiden blushes move The science of his taste to love. The sugared fruit within thy care, May more his tempted thought beguile, Than bashful beauty's timid air, Or balmy infant's gladdening smile; If lovely bride, or babe of glee, Were his, who wastes his verse on thee. Then, lucky glove, exulting go, And as in “sweets” thy day arose, In sweets its latest hour shall close, Sweets, that in kind succession flow. Young beauty shall exulting see, And bend her graceful neck to thee; While her excelling fingers twine, Around each parted arm of thine; Unconscious of its fairer days, Will boast the worth that AGE Namely.—“An old glove is good for something.” displays, And give thy hoarded sweets her praise. TO LEWIS HERVEY, ESQ. SECRETARY OF THE PRESIDENCY, WASHINGTON CITY. WHO IN THE DEPTH OF WINTER, HAD, FROM DISAPPOINTMENT, THREATENED TO EMBARK FOR FRANCE. Woulds't thou, desponding lover, fly From the charm'd arrow of that eye, Whose bow of opening heaven could dart Electric madness to thine heart; Or in its wizard circle bind The passions of thy struggling mind? Know, mid the ocean's ruffian roar, While cold, and dark the tempests pour, Still shall that look of bashful charm, Thy young untravelled soul alarm; And still that dimpling smile appear, To show the prosperous rival near. Even while some bright Parisian dame Surrounds thee with a transient flame, The steadier fire of truth will burn, And with the kindling thought return. Why then, ah hapless! would'st thou roam? Why quit thy dear engaging home? Even now when winter's surly frown, Bears the white hovering tempest down; And full his flaky pinions lower, To scatter wide the flinty shower. Ere thy first fluttering hope has flown, While sense and virtue are thy own; In thy warm youth's enamoured day, Why tear thee from thy wish away?— What miser quits his cherished store, To trust the faithless seas for more! Who would a peerless gem resign, And tempt the dark and doubtful mine? Seduced by dreams—with toil and care, To find a lovelier treasure there? If now the meek and timid maid, Of thy too ardent prayer afraid, With red averted cheek, decline To meet one passion'd vow of thine; Wilt thou, to fears and doubts resigned, Fly from her half reluctant mind? And from her wavering fancy free, The captive thought, which pleads for thee. INJUNCTION TO D. W. L. WHEN SEPARATED FROM THE OBJECT OF HIS AFFECTION BY THE ERRORS OF HIS OWN CONDUCT. Ingrate! to whom, at nature's happiest hour, Was given of heart the prize, of mind the power: Wit to delight, and virtue to improve, Much to command, and more to sanction love! Hence those dove eyes, which charmed thy soul away, Glance through the transient tear their trembling ray, Pensive, and sweet, the speaking wanderer's own, How cold the hope that lives when love is gone. Hear then that heart—its noblest precept hear— With lip of fondness dry the impatient tear; Let whispered passion every wrong remove, And wake to honour! tenderness and love!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHARACTERISTIC SONGS. SUCCESSFUL LOVER. To these joyful eyes restoring All thy person's countless charms, Say, shall fancy, still deploring, Vex thee with her vain alarms. Wayward fancy, ever dreaming, Saw that heaven which circles thee, For a sordid rival beaming, With delight's insanity. Now beheld thee coldly wandering, Ever changing—still the same— On some dangerous passion pondering, Kindled by its transient flame. Vain the fear, and weak the grieving, Since those softened eyes declare, All, in truth that's worth believing, Lives and speaks devotion there. Never more that truth suspecting, All my passioned soul is thine. And the wondering world neglecting, Thou, in beauty's blush, art mine. SONG. DEJECTED WIFE! Is it for this unwandering mind, This heart, which only glows for thee, To mark that cold averted eye, Where not one blessing beams for me! Is it for this adoring thought, Which on thy plighted honour lives, To wonder at a causeless change, Yet want the pitying hope it gives? Is it for me, who many a day, Have, in that passioned glance of thine, Read words of truth and lasting love, To doubt its character divine? Rather, since all the gods have shed Their glories round each mental grace, To bid inferior mortals find A heaven on that reflecting face; Submissive as the martyr's zeal, With suffering heart and patient eye, When hope's deceptive dream has fled, Be mine to worship, and to die. TO A BEAUTIFUL INFANT. Blest Infant! in whose rosy smiles we trace, The sire's creative thought, the lovely mother's grace, O'er thee that sire's resplendent mind shall shine, And all that mother's power to charm be thine; While thou, reflecting back, to both shalt bring Youth's fragrant bloom, in life's delicious spring: Brilliant! and blest! may no dark cloud appear, To veil the sunshine of the future year. Kind as thy birth, may partial fortune be; For all the life of genius breathes in thee. The father of this fortunate child, Mr. Featherstone Hall, a man of science and profound learning, is said to be a lineal descendant of one of the Scotch heroes; of the great Sir Walter. The beautiful and accomplished mother, daughter to the late Judge Duane, of the S. J. C. of New York, was, and surely is, lovely in person, amiable in heart, and enlightened in understanding; nor shall it be forgotten, that at a period of ill health, and great mental distress, the present writer was indebted to this eloquent beauty for consolations of voice, and refinement of mind and manner, whose tender and unaffected charm has seldom been equalled, and can never be excelled. LINES TO A LADY, DANCING. Ethereal Beauty! fairy! say, Who taught thy tiny feet to play? Was it, mid moonlight's cheerly glance, That Oberon, mingling in the dance, Gave thee his art, and bade thee go, And charm the gazing world below? Like his thine elfin footsteps shine, And all his buoyant grace is thine: Like his thy strains of music flow, When falls the cadence warbled low. No—not the monarch chanced to see, Nor gave his carols sweet to thee. But favouring nature did her part, And graceful made thee as thou art. IMPROMPTU, FOR A LADY SINGING TO A RIOTOUS AND INSENSIBLE COMPANY. Enchantress, cease! what though Amphion's song Could draw the herds and softening wilds along, No equal power thy carol'd words impart, To move and melt the vegetating heart; Though sweet their breathings as his gifted lyre, They wake no wonder, and no praise inspire! He, blest musician, poured his soul, and then Rocks seemed to feel, and brutes appeared as men— Reversed—the magic of thy charmed strain, Now falls on men turned rocks or brutes again! LINES IMPROMPTU, These were particularly induced to divert the attention of a very young person, who, having first been terrified into tears, was afterwards soothed into smiles by a severe but kind manner. UPON HEARING AN ELEVATED INDIVIDUAL ACCUSED OF PRIDE, &amp;c. &amp;c. I love to hear the grovelling mind, Thy proud unyielding spirit blame, Where genius, to itself confined, Disdains the vulgar walks of fame: But more I love the social scene, Where as thy haughty virtues bend, In silent eloquence serene, The powers of gentleness descend. Most loved, when from thy mental height, Thou deign'st with lowly voice to cheer The heart that trembles at thy sight, And timid, greets thee with a tear! Even thus the picturing artist throws O'er the strong lines which nature gives, That softening shade, whose touch bestows, The grace that speaks, the charm that lives. LINES, WRITTEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE TREMENDOUS GALE AND STORM WHICH PROVED SO GENERALLY DISASTROUS TO LIFE AND ITS POSSESSIONS, ON SEPTEMBER 23, 1815. SIMPLE ADDRESS TO MY HOME. Safe on the vale's protected breast, The portals of my mansion rest. In trembling tenderness of form, Outlive the hard and hurrying storm— While on the firm hill's cultured side, Is crushed the seat of taste and pride. To God the powerless poor belong, He shields the weak, and smites the strong. Without his will no sparrow falls, Whose shelter was thy friendly walls. My home—if quiet dwell with thee— What are the storms of life to me! So in the frail ark's tranquil view, The whirlwinds of the deluge blew; Hurtless they blew—of heaven the care, The dove of peace still rested there— Rested—while ruin's darts were hurled, To strike the chosen of the world. As yet from earth no joy shall rise, Without the atoning sacrifice— No more thy bordering elms are seen To fling their arch of darkening green— And the ripe fruit tree's nectared store, Shall wave its blooming gold no more. Though not a charm with polish'd grace Smile on thy changed and cheerless face, I love thee—that no passion rude, Profanes thy sacred solitude:— I love thee, that no envious eye, Regards thee with a passing sigh!— I love thee, for the friend sincere Whose voice of blessing greets me here, But most—that to thy haunts are given, That calm, which looks from earth to heaven. Not for the fair, the firm, the high, Does pity come with pleading eye; Thence are thy faded features dear To me, as nature's vernal year— And dear thy wasted form to me— For all I love must change like thee. LINES, TO THE SCION OF THE TULIP TREE, SHADING THE RURAL HOME OF MY ANCESTORS. The Tree which my forefathers planted and reared, To me, by THE FAME of their virtue's endeared; Has flourished with them—like them, in their prime, Exotic—yet genial, in nature and clime: That tree waves its branches of verdure and bloom, They, fading, are lost in the deep of the tomb, Yet dear is the hill, and the grove, and the plain, Which no more to the PLANTS OF THE MANSION remain, Plants nursed in thy shadow, all sportive and free, Or, stretched at thy foot, seemed as blooming as thee. Those plants all have perished, and strangers are known, To reap the rich field, which affection had sown. And yet the young scion, transferred to my care, As if the quick sense of my fathers were there, Is tender, yet brilliant, in stem and in leaf, And cheers me in sadness, and soothes me in grief. For can I forget, as I gaze upon thee, How many the branches, how mighty the tree. This may be said to apply literally, and metaphorically; literally, in allusion to that genealogical tree, which every Welsh gentleman is sure to possess, and to preserve; metaphorically, as to the living branches of a family, nearly all lost in the deep of the tomb. Whence grew the weak form, and the features so pale, Of BOTH—as WE bend to the merciless gale Of seasons—by hardness, or elements blown, To kill the firm hope, but in solitude known. Of calm to the scene, and of grace to the mind, If lonely, yet social—if injured, yet kind. EPISTLE, TO THEOPHILUS PARSONS, This great and good man, the ornament of his profession, of his country, and of the world, having, in the highest judicial station, enlightened by his wisdom and instructed by his virtues but for the short term of eight years, was then, by divine will, suddenly called from life, its usefulness, and its honours, before disease or decay had weakened the faculties of his unequalled mind, or touched the kind temper of his feeling heart. In commemoration of him who cannot die, an obituary delineation will be found on these pages; a delineation inadequate, but expressive of the gratitude which favours and benefits had inspired, and will perpetuate with the existence of memory and mind in the author. UPON HIS ACCEPTING THE APPOINTMENT OF CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT OF MASSACHUSETTS. And does that mind, which every mind excels, Quit the proud path where fame triumphant dwells? While at her side prolific fortune stands, And showers her bounty with unsparing hands— Bids but thy genius ask, and all obey— Why fling the doubly proffered boon away? For the dull bench, the inspiring robe disclaim, False to thyself, to fortune, and to fame! Thou like an eastern monarch, reign'st alone, Nor could the aspiring brother reach thy throne, Or like a giant towering o'er thy kind, In all the wondrous majesty of mind; More strong than monarchs—thine the nobler sway And yielded claim, which kindred souls obey. But now uncheered by glory's vertic rays, Tedious and tame will lour thy shadowy days. Condemned to heed the ever-during plea— Which endless folly blundering pours on thee. Or stifling all thy gentle heart's desire, With warning accents, bid the wretch expire! Even him, whose wrongs awake the generous sigh, Him, may unseeing justice doom to die! Lo, then thy fate! with pained and patient ear, The hard monotony of words to bear, Misguided error, wandering far from sense, Pride's pompous boast, and passion's bold pretence Await thee now—from morn's unwelcome ray, To the slow shadows of retreating day;— What though some soaring genius, true to thine, In mental radiance bid the forum shine, Deep—fervid, full; with sacred science fraught. And all the graced pre-eminence of thought, Forceful as reason in her high career— Yet falls like music on the astonished ear. When, as a charm, the fluent strain is found, To bid enamoured silence hover round, Calling from thee that smile which seems to speak. Gives the delighted flush to pass thy cheek.— More dark will seem the void, his pause supplies, More bleak the wild that mocks thy searching eyes. Poor is the mead the uncherished muse can give, 'Tis thine to honour, and thy praise will live. Still must thou shine, and with unequalled rays The undying Mansfield of departed days! Guide of the laws, This should have been Page 135, Note (2), as fully explained by “The highest judicial station.” an empire's boon and boast, Though fortune and her dangerous dream were lost. ODE FOR MUSIC. INSCRIBED TO GEORGE WASHINGTON, UPON HIS PUBLIC ENTRANCE IN THE TOWN OF BOSTON, DURING HIS PRESIDENCY. The season sheds its mildest ray, O'er the blue waves the sunbeams play; The bending harvest clothes the plain, The bannered vessels cheer the main; The ruddy ploughboy quits his toil, The pallid miser leaves his spoil. And grateful peans hail the festive year, Which bids Columbia's guiding chief appear. Hence disappointment's anxious eye, And pining envy's lingering sigh, Let sorrow from the brow be borne, And every heart forget to mourn, While smiles of peace their charms display, To grace this joy-devoted day; For the GREAT Washington each lyre be strung, Thy matchless deeds by every bard be sung. When Freedom raised her drooping head, And many a suffering hero led; When every hope to thee resigned, Were resting on thy glorious mind; How did that breast, to fear unknown, And feeling for HER fate alone— O'er peril's threatening form the falchion wield, And tread with dauntless step the endangered field. Not Decius—patriot dear to fame, Not Cincinnatus' deathless name,— Not HE, who led the Spartan band, The saviour of a bleeding land— Could more triumphant worth display, Nor shine with such unclouded ray, Of age the hope—of youth the leading star— The eye of peace—the conquering arm of war. TRIBUTARY LINES TO GEN. HENRY LEE. HERO AND ORATOR, IN THE ANNALS OF HIS COUNTRY; VICTIM OF PERSECUTION THROUGH THE VIOLENCE OF HER PARTY POLITICKS. Yes! thou wert born beneath the hero's star, Triumphant leader in a patriot war; Like Ammon's son, ere manhood's riper grace, Had nerved the limbs, and stampt the blooming face, Supreme in arms, a veteran foe thy claim, Thy daring valour won the prize of fame. Or at thy country's call, her powers to join; Where listening senates felt thy voice divine, As round her GREAT DELIVERER'S trophied bier, Awakened memory gave the hallowed tear— Warm from the heart, and glistening with its flame, Endeared by thee, its best libation came. Brave was that arm which taught a Briton fear, And sweet the voice that charmed a nation's ear. But not the forum, nor the battle, claim Alone thy homage, and divide thy fame, For all the graceful charities which blend, Round social life;—the husband, father, friend— Are thine—and thine a generous breast that glows With every worth, the noblest nature knows. In council honoured, as in arms renown'd, By fortune followed, and by victory crown'd; Fame is thy own—nor can a muse like mine, One flower of fragrance with thy chaplet twine. Blooming and bright, the eternal green shall cheer The closing winter of each future year, With thriftiest germ shall blosom unsubdued By faction's blight, or chill ingratitude! Mid the full wreath, no bosom'd worm shall feed— Nor envy shame it with one mingling weed, This to thy deeds doth PUBLIC VIRTUE give, That with thy country shall thy glory live! Bright as her rivers, as her hills sublime, Shall pierce her clouds, and glitter through her clime; Like a rich gem adorn the historic page, Wear through all time, and shine on every age. TO THE HON. JOHN JAY. Formed, through the paths of fame to move, Graced by a grateful people's love— Whether the helm of state As a member of the General States Convention. to guide, Or bid the storm of war subside, As one of the Commissioners for establishing the Treaty of Peace. Or to the clement virtues dear, From Afric catch the falling tear, As President of the First American Society for the Abolition of the Slave Trade. Or with a voice whose dulcet strain, Might charm to peace the phrenzied brain— O'er the stern courts of law preside, As Chief Justice of the S. J. Court of the United States. These Lines were first impelled by the circumstance of the Honourable Mr. Jay's having lost his Election to the Chair of Government, through the manœuvres of an exasperated Party counteracting the Choice of the People—which choice was indisputably established at the next Trial. Nor seem to lean on mercy's side; Or in thy soft retirement blest, Feel all the father warm thy breast— Thine is high honour's noblest cause, And thine the summit of applause. What though a party's fraudful sway Would rend thy civic crown away, To thee a nobler hope extends, For thee, the patriot prayer ascends, On thee, the honoured suffrage falls, For thee, the sacred people calls; Yet blushing science quits her strain, Silenced, and seeking thee, in vain. So when the midnight's vapoury breath, In clouds obscures the sylvan heath, No peals of music cheer the vale, No floweret scents the freshening gale, Till the bright sun, with sovereign sway, Strikes through the gloom, and leads the day. TO HIS EXCELLENCY JOHN JAY, GOVERNOR, AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF, OF THE STATE OF NEW-YORK. While those by falsehood led, with passion blind, Fall to decay, nor leave a wreck behind, Thy fame, ILLUSTRIOUS PATRIOT, will endure, Firm as thy mind, and as thy motive pure; A grateful country shall thy triumph see, And all her muses lift their harps to thee. Loved, praised, and honoured, by no ill subdued, Thine is the suffrage of the great and good. Friends of thy life, by kindred perils tried, In whom the millions of THE WEST confide. Though with rude blast the breath of envy blow, Still lives the laurel on thy tranquil brow, Still with thy genius shall thy virtues shine, And the best plaudit of A WORLD be thine. SONNET, TO MAJOR GENERAL LINCOLN. Think not, brave Lincoln, that the rage of time, Can from thy warrior brow the laurel rend; Though midst its green the living snows descend, It still shall flourish with unfading prime. See the wrapt student at his midnight oil, Recount thy deeds and lead thee down to fame, While the young hero kindles at thy name, Dwells on thy glorious wounds, and boasts thy toil. How o'er red Carolina's arid plain, Thine was to brave the dog-star's striking glow, And thine to lead bleak winters hardy train, O'er Pelham's stormy heights—through Athol's vales of snow; There, first in danger, forced thy fearless way, Here, at thy feet, subdued rebellion lay. SONNET TO THE FULL SUMMER MOON. Thou silent traveller, of the glance benign, Who from yon crystal car on high, Shedd'st the full lustre of thy moving eye, While the touched hills and vales, reflective shine. I love the wanderings of thy varied beam, What time the pale west bends thy silver wire— Till in the gorgeous east, thou bidst the sun retire, Mingling warm for warm read moist. blushes with his parting gleam. He draws his crimsoned curtain round the main, And, from the moist earth drinks refreshing dews Thou gently bending o'er the child of pain, Canst charm the sadness of the mourning muse. He, the proud emblem of oppressive power; Thou, the mild sovereign of the pitying hour! SONNET TO ADVERSITY. “For all I thank thee,—most for the severe.”— Neglected Nymph, that with unheeded sigh, Turn'st thy white cheek to every striking gale— While the base crew with wounding taunts assail And frowning wealth averts his wintry eye: Yet the rich virtues follow in thy train, Thine is compassion's tear, submission's calm; Consoling Hope, Religion's heavenly balm, And mild philosophy's instructive strain: And thine the plaintive poet's touching song, That moves to melody the chords of care, Pouring forgiveness o'er the cureless wrong, To heal the wounded spirit of despair. Ah! may I ne'er forget thy voice divine, But bless the hour that made its precepts mine. STANZAS TO AARON BURR. LATE VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. NOW UNDER IMPRISONMENT, AND TRIAL FOR HIGH TREASON. WRITTEN WHILE THE TRIAL WAS PENDING, BUT NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED. Thou wonder of the Atlantic shore, Whose deeds a million hearts appal; Thy fate shall pity's eye deplore, Or vengeance for thy ruin call. Thou man of soul! whose feeble form Seems as a leaf the gales defy, Though scattered in sedition's storm, Yet borne by glorious hope on high. Such did the youthful Ammon seem, And such does Europe's scourge Napoleon Bonaparte, at that period the scourge and destroyer of southern Europe. The following, extracted from a recently published work, has only to substitute the name of Napoleon Bonaparte for that of the Roman, and the similitude is complete. “Aaron Burr, the Julius Cesar of America, was the most astonishing man of his age; a man that inspired spirit into every thing material or immaterial with which he came in contact; a man who went about working treason, tampering with the bravest and stoutest hearts of our country, in the light of heaven, with an audacity unlike any thing ever seen in the history of disaffection setting our laws at defiance— mocking at our strength—doing that, which now he has failed, has been called madness; yet for which all the talent, the learning, and the power of the country were unable to punish him! A man, that poured his spirit of revolt, like a flood of fire, into every heart that he came near—disturbing the oldest and most cautious of our veterans; one that seemed to put himself, life and name, into the power of every human creature that he approached; yet with all this seeming, he was never in the power of mortal man, as Wilkinson and Eaton can shew; a man that suffered the legal wisdom of the whole country to array itself against him, without trembling, and then, just put out enough of his own strength and no more, to defeat and shame them. “Since the time of the Roman, there has never been a man upon this earth so like Julius Cesar, as Aaron Burr.” appear, As, of the sun, a vertic beam, The brightest in the golden year. Nature, who many a gift bestowed, The strong herculean limbs denied, But gave, a mind, where genius glowed, A soul, to valour's self allied. Ambition, as her curse was seen, Thy every blessing to annoy; To blight thy laurels tender green; The banner of thy fame destroy. Ambition by the bard defined “Ambition first sprung from your blest abodes, “The glorious fault of Angels and of Gods.” The fault of god-like hearts alone. Like fortune in her frenzy, blind, Here gives a prison, there a throne. LINES TO MRS. MONTGOMERY. WIDOW OF THE HERO WHO FELL BEFORE THE WALLS OF QUEBEC. Widow of him, a nation's boast, In life's meridian summer lost; Beloved of him, an empire's pride, With whom an hero's genius died. Montgomery, o'er whose tranquil brow, Collected honours seem to flow. Yet not to thy illustrious name, Thy lineal, thy connubial fame, Do the instructed muses raise, Their tribute of unflattering praise. To thee, the great Creator gave, Each boon that fortune's children crave— Gave taste, and talent, formed to charm, The judgment clear, the temper calm, The soul sublime, the generous breast, Where all the kindred mercies rest; That when with soft and timid eye, The child of grief and penury— From the bold front of insult turns, And life's appalling lesson learns. Thy tender accent, nature taught, Steals from her sense the torturing thought, How once her youth attractive shone, And friends, and fortune were her own. These all are thine—and rank and name, But more than these thy virtues claim, Those winning virtues which impart, The cultured mind, the feeling heart. While yet a nation's vows proclaim, How dear her lost Montgomery's fame: Yet to that fame, new honours See the national monument erected over the relicks of General Montgomery at New York, in 1819. give, And bid them with her freedom live; Nor till that freedom feels decay, Shall their least lustre fade away. Still the ne'er parted pang will turn, To HIM who fills yon gifted urn; As if but yester's mournful eve, Had taught the severed heart to grieve. While yet thy country's pitying praise, Would the remembering marble raise, While yet her people's graceful tear, Is sparkling on the glorious bier, Shall not thy griefs some solace find, In DEEDS that move a nation's mind? Deeds, through the earth's bright orbit known, Making that nation's BOAST thy own! STANZAS, INSCRIBED TO THE ORATOR OF THE CENTURY. These Stanzas were written at the immediate moment of reading the address of the orator to the pilgrims, upon the completion of the second century of their establishment on the Rock of Plymouth. Tullius, when on thy serious ear, Descends, of praise the untutored strain, When, at thy word, the admiring tear Pours homage, seldom pour'd in vain; Canst thou, in modest wisdom, calm Mindless of what the million say, Turn from its gaze the speaking charm Of eyes, that meet no kindred ray. Hast thou, when Plenty's crowded shell Was pour'd for thee, and sought thy care, Disdain'd within HER courts to dwell If bounty were not inmate there? Let others on the brow confer Wreaths to immortal genius due, Thee—would the simplest muse prefer In feelings—more than genius—true. For thou, with pity's holy flame, Hast warmed the charities benign, Scorning of sordid care the claim, Hast made the richest virtues thine. To thee the gem of fame is given, Thine is the grateful heart's regard, The blessing—and the prayer to heaven For thee—are more than earth's reward. STANZAS, TO A RECENTLY UNITED HUSBAND. In vain, upon that hand reclined, I call each plighted worth my own, Or rising to thy sovereign mind, Say that it reigns for me alone. Since, subject to its ardent sway, How many hearts were left to weep, To find the granted wish decay, And the triumphant passion sleep? Such were, of love the transient flame, Which by the kindling senses led, To every new attraction came, And from the known endearment fled. Unlike the gentle care that flows, With all the blest affections give, Unlike the generous hope that knows But for a kinder self to live. Was theirs the tender glance to speak Timid, through many a sparkling tear, The ever changing hue of cheek, Its flush of joy—its chill of fear? Or theirs the full expanded thought, By taste and moral sense refined— Each moment with instruction fraught, The tutored elegance of mind? Be mine the sacred truth that dwells On ONE, by kindred virtues known, And mine, the chastened glance, which tells That sacred truth to HIM alone. No sordid hope's insidious guise, No venal pleasure's serpent twine, Invite those soul-illumined eyes, And blend this feeling heart with thine. CONCILIATION. Graced be the hour when severed friends unite, And loved the voice, whose softened tones endear, Where the eye melting in its morning light, Dispels the cloud, and glistens through a tear When the heart freed from doubt's entangling wile, Nor joys, nor sorrows, but with pensive care, Speaks to the wedded heart, in sigh, or smile, And feels its questioned kindness answer there. While the regretful silence seems to plead, No more the timid hand its pledge denies; No more shall hurried steps, in scorn proceed, Nor anger flash from quick averted eyes. Steeled was the breast, that with a felon's heart, Could, of confiding truth, its hope bereave; Bid those whom heaven had joined, in madness part, Grieving to live—and living but to grieve. Reproach, with flushing cheek, and phrenzied brow, Sullen suspicion's cold regardless stare, Whence is thy sway—and where that midnight now, Which search'd the soul, and struck its horrors there Truth came—and as the Saviour's glance adored. Fell on the sealed eye, with opening ray; Her guiding light on darkest error poured, Gives mind to man, and clears its gloom away. Gives him to know, in blessing, to be blest, One friend, his joys—his portioned griefs to share, To find his refuge, in ONE sheltering breast, Source of his hope—and partner of his care. INSCRIPTION. FOUND AT CHANTILLY, ON AN ALTAR OF WHITE MARBLE, IN THE ISLAND OF LOVE, A BEAUTIFUL SPOT IN THE GARDENS SURROUNDING THE CHATEAU, BELONGING TO THE PRINCE OF CONDE. N'offront qu'on cœur a la beautè, Aussi nud que LA Verite; Sans ailes comme LA Constance— Sans armes comme l'Innocence! Tel fut l'Amour dans le siecle d'or, On ne le trouve plus, mais on le chercher encore. THUS PARAPHRASED, AT THE REQUEST OF A YOUNG FRIEND. Here at Beauty's graceful shrine, Thy devoted heart resign, Let the willing offering be Unwinged as changeless Constancy. Like Truth unrobed to every sense, —Unarmed as infant Innocence. Such by fabling bards wer'e told, Love appeared in age of gold, Such no more—the God, we find, Always courted—never kind. For now the wanton child is seen, With veiling vesture, fraudful mien, Around his philtered arrow flings, And cleaves the air with truant wings. STANZAS. WRITTEN ON A SOCIAL VISIT TO THE RETIRED PATRIOT, JOHN ADAMS, LATE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. Blest Patriot! in life's evening hour, Seen like the sacred sun's decline, Sublime, as when with sovereign power, The noon of glorious deeds was thine. Still bless'd amid thy graced retreat, To win the speaking glance of praise, To feel that love with homage sweet, The tribute of thy virtue pays. Bless'd, that to wound thy wearied ear, No flatterer comes, with traitor mind, But honour, as thy soul sincere, And friendship, like thine accent kind. How bless'd o'er ocean's yielding tides, Thy nation's victor-flag to see, Exulting—as her navy rides, To claim the glorious birth from thee. And blest that truths unerring page, Shall ALL thy great achievements give, Memorials of a nobler age, In IMMORTALITY to live. STANZAS. I like—it is my choice to live unseen— Unsought—by all whom busy eyes admire, To watch the brightening germ, the deepening green, And from the glare of vertic wealth retire. I like the gracious spring—the summer gay— The autumn, in his every bounty kind, The social winter's unpretending day, The kindly converse, and the modest mind. What is to me the city's revel throng, I love the sighing of the solemn grove, The soft half warble of the twilight song, The fragrant eve's reflective calm, I love. If friends have passed, and sorrows found their place, And the hurt mind laments its lone career, If lost of life the sunshine and the grace, Yet may one tender gleam of hope appear. Where the crushed thought can find a voice, and where Some healthful pleasure on the sick heart rise Some living loveliness—some buried care, Warm the cold cheek, and light the languid eyes! THE AFRICAN CHIEF. Taken in arms, fighting for his freedom, and inhumanly butchered by his conquerors! This affecting event was fully delineated in the various Gazettes of that period. See how the black ship cleaves the main, High bounding o'er the dark blue wave, Remurmuring with the groans of pain, Deep freighted with the princely slave! Did all the Gods of Afric sleep, Forgetful of their guardian love, When the white tyrants of the deep, Betrayed him in the palmy grove. A Chief of Gambia's golden shore, Whose arm the band of warriors led, Or more—the lord of generous power, By whom the foodless poor were fed. Does not the voice of reason cry, Claim the first right that nature gave, From the red scourge of bondage fly, Nor deign to live a burdened slave. Has not his suffering offspring clung, Desponding round his fettered knee; On his worn shoulder, weeping hung, And urged one effort to be free! His wife by nameless wrongs subdued, His bosom's friend to death resigned; The flinty path-way drenched in blood; He saw with cold and phrenzied mind. Strong in despair, then sought the plain, To heaven was raised his stedfast eye, Resolved to burst the crushing chain, Or mid the battle's blast to die. First of his race, he led the band, Guardless of danger, hurling round, Till by his red avenging hand, Full many a despot stained the ground. When erst Messenia's The Messenians being conquered by the Spartans, and agreeably to the custom of the age, the miserable remnant led into slavery, under these circumstances were so inhumanly oppressed, that rising, and united in arms, they seized upon a Spartan fortress, and after innumerable injuries, inflicted and reciprocated, finally obtained their freedom. sons oppressed, Flew desperate to the sanguine field, With iron cloathed each injured breast, And saw the cruel Spartan yield. Did not the soul to heaven allied, With the proud heart as greatly swell, As when the Roman Decius died, Or when the Grecian victim fell. Leonidas. Do later deeds quick rapture raise, The boon Batavia's William won, Paoli's time-enduring praise, Or the yet greater Washington! If these exalt thy sacred zeal, To hate oppression's mad controul, For bleeding Afric learn to feel, Whose Chieftain claimed a kindred soul. Ah, mourn the last disastrous hour, Lift the full eye of bootless grief, While victory treads the sultry shore, And tears from hope the captive Chief. While the hard race of pallid hue, Unpracticed in the power to feel, Resign him to the murderous crew, The horrors of the quivering wheel. Let sorrow bathe each blushing cheek, Bend piteous o'er the tortured slave, Whose wrongs compassion cannot speak, Whose only refuge was the grave. CHARACTERISTIC PORTRAIT. DELINEATED FROM THE LIFE BY AN INVISIBLE SPIRIT, FOR A MAN OF WORTH AND GENIUS, INSCRIBED TO THE SAME. The above delineation was intended for a diplomatic character, recently returned to the retirement of his own country, with a determination, it was said, not again to employ his splendid talents in her public service, either at home or abroad. It is also proper to add, even as it is true—that though originally intended for the public papers, this was never printed until now. The possible impropriety which might have been attached to the motives of the author, had she been traced and discovered, restraining her temerity. In vain thy worth would every praise disclaim, And live unhallowed by the voice of fame, With graces that might folly's self disarm, With sense to give deformity a charm, With science, in such simple garb arrayed, It seems of reason but the softening shade. Of noble nature, generous, just and bold, Unbribed by pleasure, unallured by gold. Firm—but yet feeling. With a voice whose strain Flows as it falls, and cannot flow in vain; Since the fine cadence of expression seems, Warmed by the speaking eye's electric beams, That eye, whose varying powers such truth convey, So dark, yet brilliant, so serene, yet gay. Its glance so gentle, with such strength combined, It seems the moving index of the mind, Where all the meeting rays of genius shine, And touch the lips to eloquence divine. With every grace and every worth thy own, To thee—unconscious of those gifts—alone, The tribute of this humble lay will seem, As the charm'd fiction of a poet's dream. Or careless read, and thrown with ease aside, Ne'er to thy generous self in thought applied. Nor would the artist, rising round thy name, Snatch the vain homage of a transient fame. Ne'er wilt thou know what timid hand essays, To sketch thy features, and reflect their praise. Enough for me, that every glowing line, Trace the bright semblance of a form like thine! True to the life thy modest merit give, Then rest unhonoured, and unnoticed live. Thee, fame will follow, nor with scorn repay, The growing honours of thy future day. Nor yet to shades with stealing step retire, To veil those powers which bid A WORLD admire. STANZAS TO GILBERT STUART, ON HIS INTENDED PORTRAIT OF MRS. H. THE BEAUTIFUL WIFE OF ONE OF THE NAVAL HEROES OF THE U. S. Stuart! I charge thy genius, try To catch the enchantment of that eye. Let HER, the fairest of the fair, The myrtle wreath of beauty wear, While round HER HAPPY HERO'S brow, The laurels of a nation flow. Be thy creative thought obey'd, And call to life the featured shade. Scarce touch the cheek with dawning red, Soft as the leaf from roses shed; But for the deeper lip prepare, The rubied bud which ripens there. That neck with clustering curls entwine, Make all its pearly treasures thine. Since never to thy critic eyes, May there an earthly equal rise. I charge thy genius, let it be, Reflecting HER, and speaking THEE. PROPHECY, INSCRIBED TO COMMODORE JOHN RODGERS, OF THE AMERICAN NAVY. This prophecy was literally fulfilled by the energy of arm, and of mind, victoriously displayed in the heroic defence by Commodore Rodgers, of the city of Baltimore. Intrepid Veteran of the wave, Rodgers! whose fame could terror bring To them, the boldest of the brave, The chosen of their Patriarch king. Veteran! ere time's imperious sway, Has brought the high meridian hour, Or changed one jetty lock to grey, Or touched thee with his withering power. Attend, for thou art glory's son, Born mid the battle's blaze to shine, And known, when danger's deed is done, To make the mildest mercies thine. Hear what the poet-prophet knows, Triumph is thine, and added fame, Even ere the annual summer glows, The deadly contest meets thy claim. The green Atlantic felt thy sway, As erst from dawn to fading light, Thy hero helm's impetuous way, Pursued the foe's elusive flight. That green Atlantic is thy field, There, though redoubling hosts assail; The Ocean's Lord to thee shall yield, And thee humane in victory, hail. NAVAL SONG, FOR THE PUBLIC DINNER, GIVEN IN HONOUR OF THE VICTORY OF COMMODORE PERRY, ON LAKE ERIE Hail to the youth! whose arm achieved, All that the patriot muse believed; When led by valour's noblest aim To reap the harvest field of fame. Or like the nation's eaglet rise, To suns that gleam in arctic skies. Powerful of pinion, soaring wide, Beyond the broad Atlantic tide, To where bleak Erie's winter star, Brings tempest to the front of war. There glory met thee—victory there Entwined the wreath thy temples wear, And there the Briton, nobly brave, His tributary honours gave. Honours, of worth the gift and claim, Great as the GRACEFUL CONQUEROR'S NAME. Bless'd as his mild preserving power, And generous as his Glory's hour. DIRGE. FOR THE PUBLIC FUNERAL OF CAPTAIN LAWRENCE. Victim of a Nation's wrong! Gallant sailor!—sufferer dear! To thy pallid brow belong Wreaths, impearled by victory's tear. When the battle's blast begun, Were thy living features seen, Glorious as the risen sun, As his parting ray serene. All of heart and temper kind; All of soul that seems divine, Worthy of a hero's mind, In a hero's form were thine. Must we on thy hearse bestow, Tears that speak a nation's grief, While that nation's peans flow, Grateful to her Victor chief. As in Freedom's cause to die, Was thy life's adoring prayer, In her trophied earth to lie, By the slain who slumber there. Never o'er her warrior's grave, May a nation's memory sleep, Glory that outlives the brave, Tears of angels there shall weep. ODE, INSCRIBED TO MAJOR GENERAL BROWN, CONQUEROR OF THE NORTH. Graced by that brow's transcendant height, Will the full wreath of glory flow; Like Erie's vernal waters bright, And stainless as his winter's snow. Glory, that with triumphant tread, Thee, and thy youthful warriors led. What to a nation's heart so dear, As he, who for her fame would die, What calls a nation's generous tear, Like HIM, who bleeds in victory! Ere recovered from his dangerous wounds, Major General Brown was seen returning to war and to victory. Each sacred wound, to her a gem, More prized than England's diadem. Nor ever, on that brow sublime, Can the fine wreath, or fall, or fade; But brightening with the breath of time, Be green as Erie's fragrant shade, When, breaking on the BORDER WAR, Was seen to soar thy leading star. Thine was to prove the Briton brave, As the fell Indian's might to try, Niagara's giant dome to save, Or mid his thunder's dirge to die: And where the Minstrel-Harp is known, Thee shall the muses make their own. SONG, FOR THE PUBLIC CELEBRATION OF THE NATIONAL PEACE. Tune—Rule Britannia. Not for the blood-polluted car Wake the triumphant song of fame, But for the Chief who spares the war, Touched by a suffering people's claim. Hail Columbia! Columbia blest and free, The Star of Empire leads to thee. Let the rich laurel's baneful green Bright on the warrior's front appear, But olive in HIS path be seen, Whose genius gives the prosperous year. Hail Columbia! Columbia blest and free, The Star of Empire breaks on thee. Diffused around the sacred skies, The electric ray of hope extends, On every wing of commerce flies, And to the earth's green lap descends. Hail Columbia! Columbia blest and free, The Star of Empire beams on thee. Empire, that travels wide and far, Sheds her last glories on THE WEST— Born mid the morning realms of war, She loves the peaceful evening best. Hail Columbia! Columbia blest and free, The Star of Empire rests on thee! Then let the pledge of Freedom pass, While every Patriot bosom glows, And o'er the elevated glass The amber of the vintage flows. Hail Columbia! Columbia blest and free, The Star of Empire falls with thee! It will probably be perceived that the chorus of the above song, is in allusion to Bishop Berkley's prophecy:— “Westward the course of Empire bends its way, “The four first acts already past, “The fifth shall close the drama of the day, “Time's noblest offspring is the last.” THE STAR GAZER. Ah! say ye bright inhabitants on high! Ye planetary travellers of the sky! When the world-wearied sufferers sink to rest, Is their's the mansion of your sparkling breast? Will there the voice of pity pour its balm, And her kind eye illume its heavenly charm? Will soul meet soul, though forced on earth to part, And wake with whispered wish the dreaming heart? Shall life's poor pilgrim doom'd with grief to roam, Find in your trembling rays a tranquil home, Till the last trump vibrates its kindling call, And the Immortal Mind encircles all? The atrocious Lord Rochester was converted to Christianity by Bishop Burnet; at the time, and during the sufferings of an incurable decline of constitution. Upon which occasion, the horrors of his wretched mind, and the reproaches of his awakened conscience, seem property to illustrate the contrast of religious trust and error. The younger Lord Lyttleton died as he had lived, wretched in principles, miserable in conduct, hopeless in sickness, and appalled in death; which was accelerated by the famous dream of the lady, and the bird, &amp;c. &amp;c. and most probably made more immediate by the proud and painful suppression of his desperate feelings, occasioning one of the ventricles of the heart to burst, by which he expired. MORTAL AND IMMORTAL. ADDRESSED TO ONE UNDER THE SOLICITUDE OF DOUBT. Yes! Man is mortal! round that open brow, Which, like the arch of promise, heaven reflected, Speaks THE ETERNAL MIND; even there, the dull Cold dews of death will hover, and those eyes, Whose lustre seems an ever living ray Of loveliness, and glory, soft pleading With look of eloquence, they too must fade And falter, languid in extinguished beauty. That voice, which like the harp of angels, thrills With no earthly strain, shall cease to vibrate, Or age—oblivious age—more hard than death, Shedding its late destruction, will chill The heart's fine fervour, even round the rare And radiant gem of genius, droop With an uncheerly shade, mouldering to dust And dark annihilation—age, in whose hour Man, the blest image of benignant heaven, He, whose majestic front and powerful form, Looked a descended God, the good, the wise, Shall rest unhallowed; with every featured charm That waked the gaze, or warmed the pulse of passion, Lost, and delightless—save, where unquiet, Still the phantom memory comes musing, Or hovering as a dream o'er past existence. Thus speaks The fading world—not thus the plighted friend, Who, won and valued at life's blushing dawn, Still while its setting sun, through many a cloud, Gleams o'er the furrowed path, will love its slow And mild declining, and still gaze enamoured On the parting lustre, ere calm it sink Beneath time's boundless ocean. Shall ye Not rest together? and together rise On other worlds with renovated beams, Unsevered, undiminished? Grows the heart sad in cold doubt pondering O'er life's vain promise—death's dread mystery? Yet say! THOU SON OF IMMORTALITY! Lives there not ONE, whom thy charmed thought can claim, One ever faithful friend? whom the hard earth, With poor adversity's unpitied wrongs, And envy's blighting breath, and falsehood's wile, And flattery's vain allurement, ne'er knew To change, nor triumphed to divide—neither Shall death disjoin—but rather to some star's Enlightening orb, where the All seeing eye Beams blessings infinite—adoring still, The re-united spirit will ascend, Waked by the kindling voice of seraphim. Of God and loved are they, the true in heart, Those solitary wanderers of the earth, On whom were closed her haunts of happiness; But their's the heritage and home of heaven, With full oblivion of the ills they bore, Patient and plaintless, from a sinning world, Which on the guileless sufferer flings its glance, And calls perdition, justice. THE SABBATH. AT A DISTANCE FROM MY HOME, AND MY CHURCH. These lines were ocasioned by the sarcastic question of a fellow traveller, “Can you worship out of the pale of your own church?” I stay not for the house of prayer, For God is glorious every where, In the lone wild his power is known, As in high Heaven's surrounded throne. And yet that house of prayer is dear To those who have no portion here, Dear in contrition's Confession, thoughtful sigh, And dear in praise, the adoring eye, Most dear the absolving word Absolution, divine, Which falls on faults and griefs like mine! Ah! may those pleading griefs atone, For every fault that life has known! The organ's choral peal to hear, Or the slow fall, soft-warbling clear, Till the soul feels her God is near; And, with the Diapason's note, The songs of angels seem to float, Or the rich voice—ne'er pour'd in vain, If heaven sublime the mortal strain. These would I claim on bended knee, And in the Christian's worship see The Christian's hope extend to me. Nor while the holy Pastor's prayer Proclaims the peace of God and Pastoral blessing of the protestant Episcopal Church. is there, May the disturbing world betray That hope—nor fright that peace away. LINES TO A BELOVED AND REVERED MINISTER OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. What e'er of hope's religious calm I know, To thee, Director of my thoughts, I owe, Thee—sacred shepherd of a pastoral care, Won to thy praise, as wakened by thy prayer. When doomed to feel of grief the feared excess, And lost the dream of earthly happiness, I saw thee from thine height of mind descend, And in the sorrowing suppliant, know the friend. That voice, which, like a missioned angel's strain, Ne'er pours the fine, and favouring thought in vain; Thought, born of wisdom—but as pity kind, Profound, yet lucid—forceful, yet refined. That thought—that voice—when sorrows full control Had, like a wintery tempest, chilled the soul, Could, like the vernal morning's gentle ray, Bring the calm promise of restoring day. Calm—but not brilliant—joys no more shall rise, But mournful seasons gleam through weeping skies, While thou—and heaven—a holier light bestow, To guide the sufferer through her path of woe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HYMNS. REANIMATION. WRITTEN AT THE REQUEST OF THE BOSTON HUMANE SOCIETY, AND INTENDED BY THE AUTHOR TO BE SUNG BY THE REANIMATED PERSONS WALKING IN PROCESSION. Who from the closing shades of night, When the last tear of hope is shed, Can bid the soul return to light, And break the slumber of the dead! No human skill that heart can warm, Which the cold blast of nature froze, Recall to life the perished form, The secret of the grave disclose. But Thou—our saving God—we know, Canst bless the mortal arm with power, To bid the stagnant pulses flow, The animating heat restore. Thy will, ere nature's tutored hand Could with young life these limbs unfold, Did the imprison'd brain expand, And all its countless fibres told: As from the dust thy forming breath Could the unconscious being raise, So shall the wasted voice of death Wake at thy call in songs of praise. Since twice to die is ours' alone, And twice the birth of life to see; Oh let us, suppliant at thy throne, Devote our second life to Thee. DEDICATION HYMN. WRITTEN AT THE REQUEST OF THE CHURCH OF WEST BOSTON. In vain would mortal hands prepare The temple's blest abode; Unless, supreme in mercy there, Descend the accepting God. In vain the warbled prayer we raise In strains that seem divine; Unless the heart's responsive praise, Inspiring God! be thine. Such was a Mayhew's Mayhew and Howard were Divines established to preach the Gospel in the former Sanctuary, the Reverend Mr. Lowell, a young man amiable and eloquent, was the ordained Pastor of the new Church.—These three Stanzas being local and personal, might be omitted upon any occasion for which the remaining lines might be made applicable. soul of zeal, Adoring thee with fear, He taught the sinner's heart to feel, The avenging power was near. With milder light a Howard shone, To him persuasion given, He made thy pitying promise known, Parent of earth, and heaven! Such may your youthful Pastor prove, The words of life to feel, Be his a Howard's patient love, A Mayhew's heavenly zeal! O THOU! to whom the solar blaze Is but a shadowy zone, To thee our holiest dome we raise, Glorious for God alone! HYMN. SORROW AND SUPPLICATION. Though dark and deep offences flow, Be the repentant grief sincere; Pure as the falling fleece of snow, Shall the accepted soul appear. Thine is a pitying parent's care, God of forgiveness! heed our prayer! If, pierced by many an earthly woe, The breaking heart its peace resign; On heaven that breaking heart bestow, And be its healing mercies thine! To thee our sorrowing thoughts we raise, God of compassion! hear our praise! From the bright heaven's transcendent throne Behold the Lord of life descend, Making the sentenced earth his own, The blessing of his love extend! Saviour, and God! from thee we claim, The christian's ever soaring flame! The mind that rests its hope on high, Though dark as night, as winter cold. Adoring heaven's protective eye, Shall to its glorious light unfold. The breath of worlds, the soul divine, Creative Deity! are thine. HYMN. PRAISE AND PRAYER TO GOD. In this Hymn, the Author has in part attempted to imitate the sublime adoration of the North American Indian, expressed in the following Prayer. “Oh Eternal, have mercy upon me—because I am passing away!—O Infinite—because I am but a speck!—Oh most Mighty—because I am weak!—Oh Source of Life—because I draw nigh to the Grave—Oh, Omniscient—because I am in darkness!—Oh All-Bounteous—because I am poor!—Oh All-Sufficient—because I am nothing!” Oh thou, who ere the lapse of time, Wert glorious with unfading prime; Enduring God! thy pity give, To me who but a moment live. Thy strength the elements controuls, And rules the axis of the poles; To me, in sinful suffering weak, The words of pardoning mercy speak. Thou light of worlds! whose quenchless ray Beams in the brilliant blush of day! On me, in darkest error blind, Pervading, pour the all-seeing mind! Parent of life! to whom I owe The nerves that thrill, the veins that glow, Me, sinking to the oblivious grave, May thy absolving goodness save. Immortal Being! God alone! All-giving nature is thy own; To Thee, her wandering race restore, Till all her breathing world adore. HYMN. GLORY TO GOD. To thee, creative God, I owe All that I have, or hope, or know; Each ray of mind, that seems to shine, Is but a passing gleam of thine! The lustred heavens present thy zone, The peopled earth, thy living throne; This globe, which nature holds of thee, Is bound by thy infinity! Poor, and unblessed, not mine the power, To shield from want one frugal hour, When through thy pitying care I drew The bread of peace and promise too. How vain the pride of man appears, How weak the vigour of his years, Yet thou the VITAL RAY hast given, That lights and leads his hope to heaven. TWO HYMNS, For the Celebration of the Lord's Supper, at the first Church in Dorchester. [HYMN 1st.] MANIFESTATION OF CHRIST TO THE GENTILES. Matthew, 2d. WRITTEN AT THE PARTICULAR REQUEST OF THE CHURCH AND ITS BELOVED PASTOR. When on the midnight of the east, At the dead moment of repose, Like hope on misery's darkened breast, The planet of salvation rose. The Shepherd, leaning o'er his flock, Started with broad and upward gaze; Kneel'd—while the star of Bethlehem broke On music, wakened into praise. If heathen monarchs from afar Followed, when darkness round them spread, The kindling glories of that star, And worshipped where its radiance led. Shall we, for whom that star has risen, For whom that Shepherd music flow'd, Regardless hear of sins forgiven, Nor claim the promise God bestowed! Shall we, for whom the Saviour bled, Careless his banquet's blessing see; Nor heed the parting word, that said, Remember Him, who died for thee! HYMN 2d. FOR THE LORD'S SUPPER AT THE FIRST CHURCH IN DORCHESTER. I. And hast thou, Lord to sinners given, Pardon, and peace, and hope, and heaven! To man's offending race restored The blessing of the absolving word! While to thy table we are led, And pour that wine, and break that bread, With which the incarnate God was fed! With which the incarnate God was fed! II. Ne'er may the earth's vain wishes raise, Lips hallowed by thy prayer, and praise; No more the thoughts of sin surprise Hearts of the accepted sacrifice— Hearts claimed by thee, whose wakeful woes Gave the contending world repose; Dark ere the sun of glory rose. Dark ere the sun of glory rose! III. Dark ere the rays of mercy shone, Dark ere the gospel's light was known; Dark, ere in guilt and misery's hour, The Lord of life—of love—of power, The heaven-descended Saviour, gave Eternal victory to the grave; And died—a sinning world to save, And died—a sinning world to save! STANZAS. INTENDED FOR A YOUNG ECCLESIASTIC, RECENTLY ORDAINED ONE OF THE PASTORS OF THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH. In apology—It is observed, that these Stanzas were immediate upon hearing a Sermon by the young Priest, enforcing “the Duty of Penance”—on which very solemn occasion some among the more youthful females appearing to be rather too much charmed, it was thought that the injunction, seemingly intended for the Pastor, might not be wholly lost upon the Penitent. What is the world's unhallowed charm, To one whom martyr'd saints regard; Calm is the pulse, the nerves are calm, When mortals rest on heaven's reward. And thou, like him whose TRUST In allusion to the enlightened and truly Right Reverend Bishop Cheverus, at this time Primate of the Roman Catholic Churches over the N. E. States. By every Sect, and Order of Christians, is this eloquent Prelate admired, approved, and beloved. is thine, Whose genius sheds its rays on thee, Must every flower of earth resign, For treasures of eternity. Canst thou the fruits of pleasure scorn! Wilt thou of wealth the hoards despise, Gazing on gifts that life adorn, With quiet undesiring eyes? Canst thou, while others warm, grow cold, Wilt thou while beauty kneels be blind; Though cast in Nature's finest mould— As if to Nature's self unkind? Then, Pastor, to the heavens remove, Let angels thy companions be; Wants of the world, its hate, its love, Are feelings unapproach'd by thee. Thee—bound to duty's rigid breast, To penance, and its pains resign'd, The passions of the soul suppress'd— Recall'd the wandering thoughts of mind. While some are doubting, some admiring, Be thine the saintly teacher's part, From the unholy world retiring, To learn the sacrifice of heart. To search the path his steps have trod, Thy bishop blest—whose life divine Moves gently onward to his God, The lesson of that life is thine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">MONODIES, Elegies, and Stanzas. MONODY, TO THE YOUNG HEROES WHO FOUGHT AND FELL UNDER GENERAL ST. CLAIR, IN A DESPERATE MIDNIGHT ENCOUNTER, AT THE MIAMI OF THE LAKES. Descend, bland pity! from thy native sky, Come, with thy moving plaint, and melting eye! The muses court thee from thy blest abode; Enthroned in light—embosomed in thy God! With balmy voice the wayward tidings tell, How the brave bled, and how lamented fell! How in the earliest pride of opening bloom, On houseless wilds demand a sheltering tomb! Far from the social tie, the kindred tear, Denied the relic'd urn and trophied bier. In the deep horrors of the midnight shade, In the first onset daring valour made; Each youthful warrior wastes his wearied breath. And woos stern honour in the grasp of death. Scarce seen to charm, just rising to applause, The blameless victim of a ruthless cause; Torn like a plant beneath the early spring, When shivering Eurus flaps his fateful wing. Ah say! what pure libations can be paid! What fond atonement soothe the hovering shade; In vain from frozen age the warm tears flow, In vain bright beauty droops in clouds of woe, In vain the hero's laurelled wreathes decline, In vain the minstrel swells the notes divine. They, who afar, these bootless griefs deride, And stain the fair Ohio's flowery tide, The War, productive of these ever-lamented disasters, was said to have been instigated by the rapacious cruelty of the more Savage White Settlers, who encroaching upon the Indian Territory, carried Desolation and Death even to the Habitation of their Women—finally exasperating the Sufferers to Deeds of reciprocated Violence, which deeds were terminated by a War, as fatal to Honour as to Innocence. Who the wrong'd Indian's scanty gatherings spoil, Wrest his sole hope, and strip his subject soil; Or like the rattling serpent of the heath, On the lone sleeper pour the darts of death— They must atone—from them the mourners claim, Each loved associate, and each treasured name; Their cruel hands these desolations spread, Lost, in their cause, each martyr'd stripling bled; Driven by their rage, the forest's children roam, And the lorn female wants a pitying home! As if that wild which bounteous heaven displays, From orient Phoebus to his western rays— Spread its broad breast in vain; to them denies, The gifts which nature's liberal care supplies. Since your own hills and widening vales demand, The labouring ploughshare and the culturing hand, Why must that hand pollute the ravaged heath, That forming ploughshare wage the deeds of death. Though wakening reason join her forceful strain, Still shall dejected mercy plead in vain; Or shall Columbia hear the rude behest, And clasp her murderers to her bleeding breast, Shall she with impious hand, and ruffian knife, From her first offspring snatch the claims of life, To nature's sons with tyrant rage deny, The woody mountain, and the covering sky! Ah no—each sainted shade indignant bends, Bares his deep wounds, his pallid arm extends; Return, he cries, ere every hope is lost, Ohio claims you on his ozier coast; Return; though late, your treacherous wish disclaim, Awake to justice, and arise to fame; No more with blood the blushing soil deface, And spare the patient, suffering, injured race, To you our lacerated spirits turn, From you demand a monumental Urn. For you our grievous wounds uncovered lie, Meet the hard earth, and brave the drenching sky, While the sick moon unveils her pensive brow, And the drear night-bird swells the peal of woe. Still the lorn shade its lurid vigil keeps, And oe'r the unburied bones in hopeless horror weeps. Nor crimson war, nor valour's glittering wreath, To the pale corse recall the quivering breath; 'Tis the mild power of seraph PEACE alone Can charm each grief, and every wrong atone; Her healing hand shall waft oblivion round, Pouring her opiates through each gushing wound, O'er the cold ghost a mantling Olive spread, And shade the sod that laps THE GLORIOUS DEAD. EPITAPH, ON DOCTOR ANDRE CARENTE. This Soi-disant materialist, with an Infidel head, but a feeling heart; wasteful in prosperity, and discarded in distress, was finally suffered to perish, amid the bitterness of unremembered services and unregarded poverty; having experienced the contrasted extremes of prodigal affluence, and deserted indigence. Here to his kindred earth by ills resigned, Carente, the doubting son of science lies; In this cold cell is fixed that faultering mind, Inflamed by wisdom, but yet never wise. If, in the hour his traitorous fortune smiled, Averse he viewed the worldly art to save; At last by fortune and her sons beguiled, He lived to ask that bread he wasteful gave. If shades of error cloud his guideless day, As no divinity but CHANCE he knew; Seek not to draw the hiding veil away; But own by chance full many a suffering grew. When chilled by scorn, with broken-hearted care, Lonely, and lost, he heaved his trembling breath; One friend he found—blest refuge of despair,— One only kind remembering friend in death. ELEGIAC LINES, TO THE MEMORY OF MRS. A. WIFE OF THE HONOURABLE JOHN C. J. Ah! what avails, that round her angel face, Transcendant beauty breathed its softened grace, Or what avails the friend-surrounded bier, Or e'en a matchless husband's hopeless tear! That fancy, whence the pencilled scenes arose, That hand by which the finished portrait glows, That touch, which taught the chorded notes to roll, That voice whose warbling chained the captive soul, Unconscious sleep! regardless of the care That grieving tells in life, how prized they were. The purer spirit wings its promised way— While hovering seraphs guard the beauteous clay. Bright as the rose, which sinks beneath the storm, Fair as the gathered lily's polished form; Lamented shade! for thee shall memory mourn, And living praise thy early grave adorn. With every grace the soul of sense to move, Caress'd by fortune, happy in thy love; Say, when did fate with equal lustre shine, Or what blest husband knew a joy like thine! Won by his worth, with thy perfections charmed, Endeared by hope, with mutual fondness warmed; Each opening morn increasing pleasure knew, In scenes of bliss the closing day withdrew. Great God of Wisdom! on thy just decree, What impious mortal dare to question thee! Why the blest Abba yields her valued breath, While loathing wretches court the grasp of death? While some whom hard affliction calls her own, Beneath this tedious weight of being groan. In silence breathe the unregarded sigh, And cloud with secret tears the melting eye; Or who the hidden springs of fate can find, What ruling power instructs the searching mind, Why merit droops, and prosperous vice beguiles, Why pity grieves, and rude oppression smiles; And while the living miscreant laughs at woe, O'er Beauty's urn the tears of Virtue flow! TO THE MEMORY OF THE HONOURABLE MR. BOWDOIN, LATE GOVERNOR AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS. Ah, Bowdoin, if thy sainted shade, Still wander round the cheerless glade; Or mid the rich and sparkling sky, Can heed the muses plaintive sigh; Can see a grateful country mourn, See genius deck thy laurelled urn: While those thy secret bounty fed— The tear of hopeless sorrow shed; Ah, yet extend thy patriot care, Yet heed a faithful people's prayer: Some kindred soul of heavenly fire, With thy departed worth inspire; Give him to scan the comet's way, To watch the chaste moon's bashful ray, To mark where milky myriads flow, And see the distant planets glow; O'er the blue arch undazzled gaze, Searching the sun's meridian blaze; And round the vast perfected whole, Find ONE BRIGHT ORB OF GLORY Mr. Bowdoin, in his Astronomical observations, supported the Theory of an “ALL SURROUNDING ORB.” This Theory has generated discussion and occasioned doubt, as not reducible to Philosophic certainty; yet it is generally allowed to indicate original Thought and profound Investigation. roll.

The liberal praise, the cautious blame, The charity concealed from fame, Each worth, each lustre of thy faultless mind, And with another Bowdoin grace mankind. AUX MANES DE JULIE. FROM THE GERMAN POETRY OF A SCIENTIFIC FRIEND, THUS RENDERED INTO FRENCH. Quel Astre radieux est maintenant ta demeure, O douce Julie! et dans quelle sphere celeste, retentiront un jour, devant le ciel, les cries de joie, de l'amitiè que s'y trouvent. Les larmes qu'on verse pour toi arroseraient les fleurs d'un printemps. Jeune vierge, sois à nous, si tu peux, un messager de l'Eternité! et que ta touchante voix, un jour, appelle ceux que tu aimes! THUS IMITATED IN ENGLISH, TO THE MEMORY OF JULIA, AGED FOURTEEN YEARS. Sweet Julia! say what radiant star on high, Wafts thy young graces through the glowing sky; From what harmonious sphere, IMMORTAL FAIR, Will that charmed voice the tones of comfort bear, With sister seraphs chaunt the touching strain, And give to hope thine angel-form again? The tears that unavailing fondness pours, Shall meet the spring and bathe its fairest flowers. Emblems of thee—now withering in thy tomb— So fresh in youth, so fragrant in thy bloom. Celestial scenes will every wish employ, Till thou, and heaven, restore a mother's joy, Yet—if thou canst—her sleepless cares controul, Glance thy light vision on her clouded soul, The veil of grief with holiest touch remove, And point the path of REUNITED LOVE. MEMENTO, FOR MY INFANT, WHO LIVED BUT EIGHTEEN HOURS: As the pure snow-drop, child of April tears, Shook by the rough wind's desolating breath— Scarce o'er the chilly sod its low head rears, And trembling dies upon the parent heath. So my lost boy, arrayed in fancy's charms, Just born to mourn—with premature decay To the cold tyrant stretched his feeble arms, And struggling sighed his little life away. As not in vain the early snow-drop rose, Though short its date, and hard the withering gale; Since its pale bloom ethereal balm bestows, And cheers with vernal hope the wasted vale. My perished child, dear pledge of many a pain! Torn from this ruffian world, in yon bright sphere, Joins with awakened voice the cherub train, And pours his sweet breath on a mother's ear. Kind dreams of morn his fairy phantom bring, And floating tones of extasy impart, Soft as when Seraphs strike the heavenly string To charm the settled sorrow of the heart. MONODY, TO THE MEMORY OF GENERAL HENRY KNOX, WHO DIED IN OCTOBER, 1806. The year that deprived his family, his friends and his country of the society, the virtues, and the services of the heroic and amiable Knox; the three great Luminaries of the Elder World were likewise extinguished. With all of nature's gift, and fortune's claim, A soul of honour, and a life of fame; A warrior-chief in victory's field renowned, A statesman with the wreath of virtue crowned— Such, Knox, wert thou! Shall truth's immortal strain, Recall thy deeds, and plead their worth in vain! Sacred and sainted mid yon radiant sky, In vain shall friendship breathe her holiest sigh? Where is that pity known thy life to share, Softening the beams by glory blazoned there. Lost like thy form, with that unconscious grown, Of all thy fine affections called their own! Ne'er shall that smile its speaking charm impart, To win the angered passions from the heart: No more that voice like melting music flow, Sweet in its sadness o'er another's woe. But round thy tomb despair will live to weep, Cold as the cearments of thy marble sleep. Yet wert thou blest!—ere age with chill delay Quenched of the fervid mind its sacred ray— Heaven called thee hence—nor nature's late decline, Saw thy full lustred fame forbear to shine. Called thee with patriot spirits earth-approved, With heroes by the Queen of Ocean loved. While on that world of waters, victory gave, Immortal Nelson gained a glorious grave. When Pitt, the soul of Albion, reached the skies, And saw the RIVAL OF HIS GREATNESS rise. Fox, loved of fame, an empire's guide and boast, His voice sublime mid wondering plaudits lost. These, like thyself—for God-like deeds admired, In the ripe Autumn of their years expired. Hence shall each kindred genius blend with thine, And mingling in collected radiance shine. Honoured in life, in death to memory dear, Not hopeless falls the tributary tear. For what is death, but life's beginning hour, The poor man's glory, and the good man's power; Replete with every bliss we taste below, Source of the hope we feel, the truth we know. Then not for thee, BLESSED SHADE! the grief be given; For thee, beloved on earth—approved in heaven, Thy cherished worth shall still retain the power, To soothe the lonely—bless the social hour, And thy remembered virtues light the gloom That death's deep night has gathered o'er thy tomb, RECOLLECTIONS, TO THE MEMORY OF THEOPHILUS PARSONS, LATE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE S. J. C. OF MASSACHUSETTS. Is then that mind, whose all-perceptive eye, Seem'd an imparted light of Deity. That mind which from the sordid earth could soar To worlds where angels tremble and adore; Is that extinguished?—As the sun's low ray, By the cold twilight cloud is borne away— Or like that sun, in heaven's congenial clime, Again to wake, with energy sublime! Hid, but not lost, the undying part shall rise, More pure, more just, more hallowed, and more wise. And as on earth unequalled, and alone, With God's own light the immortal genius shone. Restored to heaven, with saints and angel's there, He breathes the blessing, lifts the guardian prayer. That eye, whose glance, by guileless nature taught, Spoke the full feeling, beamed the unbounded thought, That smile assuring, whose protective charm, Fell on the timid heart, like pity's balm, With temper kind as heaven, whose cheering glow, Shed its warm beams on every shade of woe: That wit spontaneous, whose attractive ease, Careless of pleasing—never failed to please, In Page 135 of this work, will be seen an Epistle to Theophilus Parsons.—But too soon after that was written, were the distressed feelings of the Author called to substitute an Obituary of this Great and Good Man—whom she there seemed to admonish. That moral wisdom winning, yet severe, Which speechless wonder bent entranced to hear. These shall the melancholy thought restore, And weep to think, they live to charm no more. Admired! beloved! to earth's affections lost, But throned in heaven, beyond the seraph host, Angel! or saint! ah deign our griefs to see, Nor let the wanderer memory stray from thee. STANZAS, UPON SEEING AN IMPERFECT SKETCH DESIGNED FROM MEMORY, FOR THE POWERFUL FEATURES OF THE LATE AND EVER LAMENTED PROFESSOR MC KEAN. How vain the painter's classic aim, To keep that clear, and glorious eye, Whose rays from heaven's most hallowed flame, Touched close on immortality. As vain the peaceful smile to trace, Which warm in life's affections grew, And poured of soul a speaking grace, To every mental feeling true. Perfection not to man is given, But thou Mc Kean, so kindly shone, That loved by earth, and blessed by heaven, Both claimed thy genius as their own. Frail were the wish, that soaring mind, These features to God's image near, Like the winged Eagle, earth confined, Were longer lent to languish here. LAMENTATIONS OF AN UNFORTUNATE MOTHER, OVER THE TOMB OF HER ONLY SON. Charles Ward Apthorp Morton expired of a Dropsy of the Brain, a disease always accompanied by premature but extraordinary capacity. Its fatal termination was accelerated by sedentary habits and intense study. In his very early childhood he appeared a prodigy of genius;—and entered the University at thirteen—where he gave the fairest promise of excellence in Science and the Fine Arts; for although endowed by nature with a taste for the Sister Powers of Music, Painting and Poetry; from his devotion to the more honourable pursuits of Science, he relinquished these but a short time previous to his last illness. His heart was noble and sincere; abounding with passions, and affections. His integrity unblemished and his death productive of self-despair to his unfortunate Mother. At his early age having already made Improvements in Medical Electricity; for which he received a Certificate from the President and Professors of Harvard University. But his whole existence was that of suffering, owing to the original feebleness of his constitution and the energetic sensibility of his mind. “Oh lost!” forever lost—thy mother's eyes, No more shall see thy morn of hope arise, No more for her its day resplendent shine, But grief eternal rule like wrath divine, Blotting from earth's drear scene each mental ray That chased the phantom of despair away. When fortune saw me all her gifts resign, No murmur wakened, for thy love was mine; Though hard her frown, and many a blow severe Called to thy brilliant eye the clouding tear; Yet poor the boon that waits on fortunes store, Since the full pampered heart still pines for more. Distress on thee, my son, her mildews shed, To blight the laurel blooming round thy head; Chilled by her grasp, but not to wrongs resigned, For warm as summer glowed thine active mind; No syren pleasure, potent to betray, Ere lured thy lone and studious hours away. But science on thy young attractions smiled, For genius gave thee birth, and called thee child. The painter's touch, the minstrel's art divine, With many a charm of polished life were thine, And thine the soul sublime, too ardent wrought, The impetuous feeling, and the burst of thought; Strong and resistless—to the few alone, Was all the treasure of thy being known. Cold was its fate—yet o'er thy wrongs supreme Young Genius rose—with rich and radiant beam, While the fine eye, to that and nature true, Spoke all that mind inspired, or sorrow knew. Poor Boy! I thought thou o'er my urn would'st weep! And grieving yield me to the tomb's last sleep; Nor, in thy dawn of years, when hope was gay, Like heaven's bright arch of promise, melt away— Lost, like a sun-beam in the spring's chill hours, And transient as the garden's earliest flowers: But dearer thou than rays that morn illume, And lovelier far than nature's vernal bloom; These, when the storm has past, again return, But what shall wake thy deep death-slumbering urn? What but the voice of heaven, that strain divine, Which bids the trembling earth its trust resign. Then the bold genius, and the feelings wild, No more to wrongs and woes shall bear my child; But that warm heart to generous pity known, Which all the grieved affections made their own, With the pure essence of that brain of fire, Shall to a Seraph's fervid flame aspire; And angels with arch-angels, pleased to find, The blest expression of thy kindred mind; Charming from memory's thought its earthly pain, Will give thee to thy mother's soul again. STANZAS, INDUCED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF A SINGLE DROP OF RAIN, HAVING FALLEN AS THE AUTHOR WAS ENTERING THE UNDER AISLE OF THE CHAPEL CONSECRATED TO THE DEAD. Soft was the drop, and seemed to flow From heaven—as if an angels eye, Gazing upon this form of woe, Had melted to its murmured sigh. Cold was the tear, and cold it fell, Where never hope, nor life, shall warm; Since sepulchred those graces dwell— Which gave to life and hope their charm! Region of tears! thy echoing aisle, No strains but grief has ever known, Fearful it freezes nature's smile, And looks on misery alone! Why does the desperate mourner call On thee—in many an accent wild? Deaf is thy cold and clammy wall— Dead as the passions of her child. Yet the sweet seraph peace is here, Lost to the world, she dwells with thee; And gives from heaven an angel's tear, To shed its pitying dew on me. Spirit of him my soul adored! When will this bosom rest with thine! No more thy living woes deplored, Shalt thou and happiness be mine? STANZAS, OCCASIONED BY THE QUESTION OF A FRIEND, “WHAT HAS PRESERVED YOU?” When I saw my youth's best treasure, Life's first blessing yield his breath— Did my breaking heart resign him, To the mouldering caves of death? No—I watched him, fondly watched him, With a mother's longing eye; Gazing on each tranquil feature, Till it seemed too dear to die. This is no poetical fiction. When it was thought incumbent to perform the last pious obligation, resigning the dead to the sepulchre of his maternal Ancestors, under the desperate possibility that life was not wholly extinguished, his desolate Mother continued to visit the melancholy aisle, in which his remains were deposited, until even that last Hope was extinguished—and “Another and a better world” alone remains to console her incurable afflictions. Eight lorn days of speechless horror, Morning saw my steps return; And the glooms of evening found me, Weeping o'er the unburied urn. Still as cold as Parian marble, Were those features, resting mild— But this dying heart felt colder, Than the bosom of its child. Dying, but not yet to perish, Heaven in pity saw its woes, And on calm'd religion resting, Bid the murmurer find repose. Hovering, like an angel o'er me, When of life was lost the care— She, the child of hope, sustained me, She has saved me from despair. LINES ENCLOSING THE BEAUTIFUL RINGLETS OF MY SON. Those hazle ringlets, nature's boon designed, So oft around my parting fingers twined, Shorn from their brow of beauty, seem to say, His praise shall live, bright and unchanged as they. APOSTROPHE, TO THE MEMORY OF MY BELOVED DAGHTER CHARLOTTE. FRAGMENT. Daughter adored! and good, and fair, That this melancholy Apostrophe, and in addition to this— the Stanzas in page 67—was and were correctly just, and free from the exaggeration of maternal enthusiasm, the Author appeals to the recollections of hundreds—perhaps thousands —of living individuals, who have seen Charlotte Morton in the dawn of fifteen, and these will surely admit, that a Beauty more brilliant—a Temper more celestial—and a Mind more enriched by Talents and by Virtues, had never met observation, nor inspired affection. A complexion of the most delicate bloom, large dark eyes of enchanting blue, long ringlets of flaxen gold, in which no tint of the auburn nor approach to the red were seen, a smile seemingly of itself perfect beauty—an ivory neck and shoulders, in symmetry a model for sculpture—sweetness, softness, elegance—a musician, a painter, a poet. This beautiful and highly gifted being was married early, and perished in the morning of her days, the victim of cares, and of climate—leaving her affectionate Mother the sole consolation of remembering that the two last happy years of her life were passed under the parental roof, until within three months of her decease, when at the request of her absent husband she voluntarily followed his fortunes, and became the affectionate victim of conjugal duty. As the unsinning angels were! No more the heaven that filled thine eyes, Shall o'er a mother's sorrows rise, Like the blue morning's soften'd ray, To charm the clouds of grief away. That mother lived—and lives—to see The gift of God recall'd in thee: Despair's deep voice appall'd to hear, Slow whisp'ring that thou art not near. Despair's chill glance on anguish borne, To feel and know thy life is gone. Ne'er did the tender morning shine On deeds of filial love like thine; Nor to the western world was known A beauty lovelier than thine own: Genius was thine, and taste refined, And gentle temper's feeling mind; Temper, whose fine unclouded mien Shone constant, gracious, kind, serene. Ah! what does earth's dim orb supply, Like heavenly temper's angel eye! Or the discordant world afford Of music, like her answering word! Child of my sorrowing soul! to me Thou wert an earthly deity! Hope round thine infant pillow played, Hope in thine early grave is laid; A mother's hope, and lost despair, Has led his haunting spectres there. This fragment was immediately impelled by reading her last faithfully fond Letter to a dear and distressed Mother. LINES, TO THOSE WHO HAVE SAID “YOU ARE TRANQUIL.” If calm the forehead's silent air, As peace with folded wing were there; Nor tear betray the electric pain, Which rushes on the trembling brain: Nor does the speaking sigh impart What dies within the closing heart; As firm the unfaultering voice may seem, And clear the cold eye's transient gleam: Yet has the secret sufferer known To dwell on hope forever flown. And that cold eye been wont to weep, While memory rose—to murder sleep. Even thus the rainbow's arch of flame, In token of deliverance came! Though garb'd in nature's tranquil form, Its home the cloud, its birth the storm; While bruised, the drooping groves declare, How hard the thunder's bolt struck there. Could glance, or moan, or murmur, show That selfish, solitary woe, To one unwandering thought confined A hermit on the desert mind, A wreck, from life's full ocean toss'd, In the hard storm of anguish lost, Yet to the careless world appears, Nor breathed in sighs, nor drown'd in tears: Thus o'er the mansion—home of death, The chapel curves the polish'd dome, Where music pours his angel breath, And beauty brings her mortal bloom, With mingling praise, and melting prayer, As heaven and earth were meeting there. Mindless of RUIN'S rapid power, Heed they, that near sepulchral gloom? Where late his sceptred arm was laid On glory's wreath and beauty's flower, Causing their blended tints to fade, In the long winter of the tomb, Heed they, in youth's beginning year, The threatening blast, cold-hovering near? Heed they mid life's meridian glow How fast the falling shadows flow, Which evening's sullen hours bestow? If sunk the earth's vain hope appear, Again its ray may dawn, and rise Smiles mingle with the grieving tear, But cherish'd sorrow never dies. INVOCATION, TO THE SHADES OF MY ANCESTORS, WENTWORTH AND APTHORP. “A proud inheritance I claim, In all their sufferings, all their fame.” Montgomery. Shadows of Men, revered and great! Or good! or crushed by adverse fate! O'er your devoted offspring bend, To her who seeks no earthly friend! Mission'd of God, descend! Let her imploring tear and sigh, Yield to the thought that ye are nigh; Guarding with blest paternal eye, The action of her woes. Your height, your fall, your wrongs declare, And show how bless'd, how cursed ye were, Prisoned in earth's domains; Let Strafford, Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford, the Minister, and favourite of Charles the First, sacrificed by that Monarch to his own personal safety—was beheaded near the end of the reign. Charles, in his last moments, declared that he suffered justly for having given up the Earl of Strafford to popular fury.—See Hume's History. The near Relations of this Nobleman were the founders of the American Family of Wentworth. This family being presumptive heirs to the now extinct Title of that Earldom of Strafford. chosen of a king, The features of his history bring, Expressive, as when warm in life, Ere the red block and severing knife, His monarch's fearful faith bestows, How bright in opening morn he rose, How dark at fate's tremendous close, Alternate joys and pains. And ye, the blooming brothers, These were Henry and Samuel Wentworth, the maternal uncles of the Author, both perished before they had attained the age of 20. The first, on a northern voyage of curiosity and improvement, was entangled amid floating masses of ice, and in that situation expired along with the whole ship's company, passengers and seamen. His young brother, Samuel Wentworth, having been invited to England by his noble relatives, was under the patronage of those, admitted as student at the Temple; at which period he first met Miss Lane, the object of his honourable passion, and the cause of his fatal misfortunes, the daughter of a great commercial house of that period. Her large inheritance, by her father's will, made dependent on the pleasure of her mercantile brother, to the aristocracy of whose wealth, young Wentworth could only oppose nobility of birth, accomplishment of mind and beauty of person, possessions which the man of commerce held as nothing, compared with the superior treasures of monied interest. Consequently the love was prohibited, and the lover banished from his mistress; who though closely imprisoned in her own apartment, found means to preserve an epistolary connection. The correspondence encreasing the enthusiasm of restricted passion, until every possible hope of their union being extinguished, a deadly vial was obtained, and the contents, equally divided, were at one desperate moment swallowed by both. Their last desire, of being buried in the same grave, was denied. These frantic and too affectionate lovers, finished the short career of their miseries on the birth day of Wentworth, being that which completed the nineteeth year of his age. And it is not irrelevant to add, that the brother of the lady lived to lose his immense possessions, and died desolate and distressed; at which period, we trust, repentance came, and forgiveness was awarded. come, Victims of youth's untimely doom; This to the elements a prey, That flung the gem of life away, With an unholy hand. Ah! be his ills thy lesson made, And though enclosed by misery's shade, Await thy God's command. Distant and dark—by graves divided—far From her, who rose his morning's earliest star; Her, whose sweet eyes of love, and polish'd mind, Were to the young and graceful Wentworth kind, Impious—in plighted faith of heart, to share The unpermitted chalice of despair. Not theirs the altar's consecrated flame, Which soars to Heaven in honor, peace and fame, Whose chasten'd light is seen on earth to glow, Like moon-beams o'er a sculptur'd angels brow; But theirs a meteor-plague which threatning shone, Till every fluttering wing of fear had flown; A meteor-plague, whose inauspicious ray Bore all the blooming health of hope away. That blessing which the dream of passion sought, Waked to the frantic extasy of thought. Opposed—in life with fated fondness grew, Opposed—in dust no mingling union knew. And thence, in ever parted tombs they lie, Martyrs of morbid love's insanity. Love, the betrayer! near whose breath of fire, The calm affections tremble—or retire— So in the Land of Ice, mid stainless snows, His boiling strength the dangerous Geyser The Great Geyser, or Boiling Fountain of Iceland, ejects a stream of boiling water, sometimes more than a hundred feet upward, wrapped in foam—and encircled by beautiful rainbows, burying itself beneath the rock, and ascending the skies in constant alternation—the effect of subterranean fires sometimes giving the appearance of deep red or green to parts of the Geyser.—See Sir G. S. Mackenzie. Also, I think; Dr. Henderson, the last Traveller who has published Observations on the Great Geyser. show Powerful in mischief—bold in beauty soars From shuddering earth, to heaven's receding towers. Pervading all; but not in all the same, Here pale with frost, there blushing red with flame. Chain'd to the rock, or lifted to the skies, Round his white brow benignant rainbows rise; Hope in their smiles—can hope that breast reveal, Whose hidden fires a secret foe conceal? Whose baneful deeds, like Geyser's fountain prove, A heart that burns, or boils, with hate or love. Destructive powers! if fiends on earth are known, Their reign is passion—and its height their throne. Apthorp! my proud paternal line, John, the founder of the transatlantic race of Apthorp, was a man of taste and talent in the Fine Arts; particularly those of Painting and Architecture. A taste and talent, which has in some instance been transmitted to his descendants even of the fifth generation. An ardent imagination, and an ambitious desire of mental improvement, led him from his native country of Wales. And in England, he saw, loved, and married, Miss Ward, a celebrated beauty, with a large fortune, whose Portrait, by Sir Peter Lely, yet remains with her descendant. This portrait is distinguished by the long dark eyes, which that artist preferred and made fashionable. The qualities of both parents live, and are conspicuous in some of their descendants. A highly respectable individual of these, whose superiority of mind may possibly disdain such recollections, was, in his minority, so transcendantly handsome, that upon a Tour through the Southern States, he was generally designated “The Eastern Angel.” As he now is, the Genius of Canova, might design that form as a model for the sublime statue of melancholy, since his fortunes have fallen—like those of his race—a voluntary sacrifice to the best sentiments, and the noblest feelings of humanity, while domestic bereavements coming yet nearer to his gracious heart have left it the prey of sorrow. Charles Bulfinch, Esq. of Washington, at this time, the National Architect, is one more evidence of the inestimable happiness of a good descent. The homage of my soul is thine, Where Cambria's minstrel-realm appears A beauty—or in smiles—or tears. In scenes, where rich the sun-beam glows, And swift the sleepless torrent flows, Beneath the mountain's weight of snows— The fathers of my sires, had there Birth—blessings—griefs, and sepulchre; A favoured race, to fortune known, Still on the rude armorial stone, Mid the cold ivy's trembling green, The annals of their deeds are seen. By Lion-hearted Richard led, How bold they fought, how fearless bled— How erst the shield, whose CRESTED pride, A royal gift—in crimson dyed,— Had graced that Christian Warrior's side, Whose sons, in youth's romantic day, Tempting rude ocean's dangerous sway, To the far land of promise came, Not forced by want, nor driven by shame; But to endearing fancy true, Fancy, that loves and woos the distant and the new. These, to the young and lovely shore, The glories of their lineage bore, Talent, and taste, and truth severe, And honour, as existence dear; With hurrying passions unconfined, Was pity's oft relenting mind; And bounty's glowing heart so warm, And beauty of celestial form. The wanderers reared God's dome of prayer, And rest in sculptured memory there. The present Stone Chapel—originally the King's Chapel— founded by Royalty, was finished by the generosity of individuals. Charles Apthorp, Esq. the son of John, gave 5000l. sterling, a very large sum for the Provinces at that period, about the middle of the eighteenth century. His Marble Monument with a very fine Latin Inscription, by his Son, still remains in the Chapel, which Monument covers the Tomb of the truly noble-minded race of Apthorp. How erst the shield, whose crested pride. The Crest, if not the whole Armorial Bearing, is thought or said to have been conferred upon the Battle Field by Richard. Soon to that honour sanctioned tomb, The remnant of the race shall come, Cold, slumbering by its relics lay, Unconscious of the kindred clay. Shades of my Fathers! great, or good, This heart yet glorying in your blood, Pleads for that peace which earth denies, The living branch, whose foliage young, Mid your deep-rooted virtues sprung; With a good angel's guardian care, Shield from the night-frost of despair, Driven by life's storms, its torn leaf lies, Immortal, full in bloom to rise. Sires of a firm unbroken line, Source of my life—YOUR HEAVEN IS MINE. Apology. In Apology for what may properly be termed a mere medley of mind, in Thoughts and Fragments; it seems honest to explain how written, and why published. Far from having originally presumed to attempt regulating the capacities, or amending the hearts of others; the sole view of the author has been, to correct and console her own. A series of disappointments, with distress, cruelly aggravated by the premature death of very dear children, having left that stagnation of heart, and that pulsation of brain, which sometimes seems to precede the most deplorable of human miseries; to avert the apprehended possibility of this, the aid of constant occupation, and continued self-examination, was resorted to; that self-examination inducing recollection, and impelling resolution, as to cause, effect, and remedy. The early morning and the late evening, given to the question of her own faults, many mistakes, and continued afflictions, the result of such enquiry was committed to fragments of paper, with the single intent of being referred to, and acted upon by the author's solitary self, who—not of the world, yet stood among them—and met the frowns, and passed the smiles of the many, and had Thoughts, and essayed to write of them also. Finally, the accumulation of Fragments occasioning difficulty of selection, these were arranged by the author, and slowly transcribed into one manuscript—sufficient for a book—that is, sufficient in pages—but probably insufficient in every other requisite; this was her belief, and this belief virtually confirmed by the opinion of some to whom a very small portion of the work had been timidly communicated. And yet, under every personal and particular discouragement, the author could think that those poor fragments, which had done so much for the dispositions of her own mind, might, under similar exigencies, effect something for the benefit of others; and with this impression stampt on her heart, she had the temerity to apply to one, who honours and hallows the cloth that he wears, and by the unerring genius of that one, was countenanced, favoured, and encouraged, and did venture—even amid existing fears, appalling predictions, and conscious inefficiency, to hope, and to ask for patronage —and that patronage was awarded by the gentle and the generous; and if ultimately supposed to have been lavished upon the dull, and the incompetent, will surely not be thrown away upon the assuming and the ungrateful. S. W. M. The following Lines, having been omitted in their proper place, solely by the fault of the Author, are here inserted, as seemingly essential to illustrate the historical series of extreme events, compelled by the power and progress of Time. These Lines the Reader will, if he please, supply, p. 106. “Where great Sesostris rears his trophied bust A mouldering pageant and an empty name.” Whose harness'd steeds—a mournful band!— Were monarchs, conquered by his hand! The trappings, which their shoulders bore, Once royal robes, were stiff with gore 'Till Time, a friend to Misery true, The victim,—or the victor, slew; And held the car, or heav'd the chain, Of this the triumph—that the pain— The car—the chain—whose blended sway The happy and the hurt obey. Egypt, whose meads the barbarous Turk deflowers, While the wild Arab mocks her murdered powers, Assisting thee to blight her fading fame.</field>
