      <field name="fulltext">Vol. I. TO THE NAME AND MEMORY OF MY MOTHER, (THE POET'S HEART-TREASURE,) THESE Poems of My Father ARE AFFECTIONATELY INSCRIBED, BY FREDERICK A. WOODWORT. PASTORAL POEMS. THE BUCKET. How dear to this heart are the scenes of my childhood, When fond recollection presents them to view! The orchard, the meadow, the deep-tangled wild-wood, And every loved spot which my infancy knew! The wide-spreading pond, and the mill that stood by it, The bridge, and the rock where the cataract fell, The cot of my father, the dairy-house nigh it, And e'en the rude bucket that hung in the wellâ The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket, The moss-covered bucket which hung in the well. That moss-covered vessel I hailed as a treasure, For often at noon, when returned from the field, I found it the source of an exquisite pleasure, The purest and sweetest that nature can yield. How ardent I seized it, with hands that were glowing, And quick to the white-pebbled bottom it fell; Then soon, with the emblem of truth overflowing, And dripping with coolness, it rose from the wellâ The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket, The moss-covered bucket, arose from the well. How sweet from the green mossy brim to receive it, As poised on the curb it inclined to my lips! Not a full blushing goblet could tempt me to leave it, The brightest that beauty or revelry sips. And now, far removed from the loved habitation, The tear of regret will intrusively swell, As fancy reverts to my father's plantation, And sighs for the bucket that hangs in the wellâ The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket, The moss-covered bucket that hangs in the well! THE VILLAGE CLOCK. The morn awakes, in blushes dressed, The lambs are all at play, The blackbird quits his dewy nest, And carols on the spray; The milkmaid hails the rosy dawn, The shepherd seeks his fleecy flock, The woods resound to the hunter's horn, All roused by the village clock. Tick! tick!âtick! tick!âtick! tick! All roused by the village clock. The milky herd their stores resign, And soon regain the mead, Where cooling shades and streams combine To cheer them while they feed. When evening twilight veils the lawn, Again the milkmaid trips away, While woods resound to the distant horn, At the closing hour of day. Tick! tick!âtick! tick!âtick! tick! At the closing hour of day. MY FATHER'S FARM. Believe me, if there's aught on earth, That can each grief disarm, 'Tis the sweet spot which gave me birth, When smiling memory paints its worth, It is my father's farm. For every native rural charm Adorns my father's farm. Though fancy's flight may mock the blast, To seek some distant charm, How soon her eyes are homeward cast! She roves awhile, but lights, at last, Upon my father's farm. For every native rural charm Adorns my father's farm. THE HAY-MAKERS. It is sweet, love, to stray, When the noon-tide is over, Through the windrows of hay, And the white-blossomed clover; Where each lass may partake In the toil and the pleasure, Keeping time, with the rake, To the lark's tuneful measure. Oh 'tis sweet thus to stray, When the noon-tide is over, Through the windrows of hay, And the white-blossomed clover. There the swains cut their paths Through the sections assigned them, Leaving sweet-scented swaths Swelling gayly behind them. Tender childhood and age, Sturdy manhood and beauty, All with ardor engage In so pleasing a duty. Oh 'tis sweet thus to stray, When the noon-tide is over, Through the windrows of hay, And the white-blossomed clover. As the billow of grass Over the meadow is driven, By some rose-visaged lass 'Tis divided and riven, When her swain lends his aid, And the green hillock rises, Then the half-willing maid With a sly kiss surprises. Oh 'tis sweet thus to stray, When the noon-tide is over, Through the windrows of hay, And the white blossomed clover. See the gay romping elves, Now the sweet task is over, All amusing themselves, On the balm-breathing clover; There the swain whispers love To his heart's dearest treasure, Who affects to reprove, While her eyes beam with pleasure. Oh 'tis sweet thus to stray, When the noon-tide is over, Through the windrows of hay, And the white-blossomed clover. HARVEST-HOME. When mellow autumn yields All her golden treasures, Then those who dressed the fields, Partake of harvest pleasures. This, lads, is harvest-home: Those who labor daily, Well know 'tis sweet to come, And pass the evening gayly. Then let each heart be light, Here's no room for sorrow, Joy holds her court to-night, Care may call to-morrow. Now labor wipes his brow, Rest and plenty wait him, Barn, cellar, rick, and mow, Are filled to recreate him. Scythe, sickle, rake, and hoe, All are now suspended, Like trophies in a row, For future use intended. Then let each heart be light, Here's no room for sorrow, Joy holds her court to-night, Care may call to-morrow. Now gay Pomona's store Past exertions blesses; Rich streams of nectar pour, Sparkling from her presses. Full goblets, steaming board, Crown the farmer's labors, These real bliss afford, When shared by jovial neighbors. Then let each heart beat light, Here 's no room for sorrow, Joy holds her court to-night, Care may call to-morrow. THE WATERMELON. 'Twas noon, and the reapers reposed on the bank Where our rural repast had been spread, Beside us meandered the rill where we drank, And the green willows waved overhead. Lucinda, the queen of our rustical treat, With smiles, like the season, auspicious, Had rendered the scene and the banquet more sweet, But, oh! the dessert was delicious! A melon, the richest that loaded the vine, The kind-hearted damsel had brought, Its crimson core teemed with the sweetest of wine, âHow much like her kisses!â I thought. And I said, as its nectarous juices I quaffed âHow vain are the joys of the vicious! No tropical fruit ever furnished a draught So innocent, pure, and delicious. In the seeds which embellished this red juicy core An emblem of life we may view, For human enjoyments are thus sprinkled over With specks of an ebony hue. But if we are wise to discard from the mind Every thought and affection that 's vicious, Like the seed-speckled core of the melon, we'll find Each innocent pleasure delicious.â SWEET SECLUSION. Here, in scenes of sweet seclusion, Far from bustling towns, we dwell, While around, in rich profusion, Autumn's yellow bounties swell. There, the loaded fruit-trees, bending, Strew with mellow gold the land; Here, on high, from vines impending, Purple clusters court the hand. All the day, to recreate us, Strains of music freight the breeze, Healthful sports at eve awaits us, What are city joys to those? THE MILKMAID. When blushing Aurora first tinges the east, Arousing the musical choirs of the wood, Inviting the bees to a nectarious feast, And the flocks to partake of their dew-sprinkled food, As blithe and as gay as the new-awakened day, I rise and go tripping with milkpail away, And hark! the sweet lark, kindly perched on the spray, Responsively echoes my blithe roundelay. The innocent plunder I draw from the kine Is richly repaid in the fields where they roam, And a second supply they will gladly resign, When evening invites, and they lowing come home. Then, cheerful and gay as the first smile of day, Again will I trip it with milkpail away; And hark! the sweet lark, kindly perched on the spray, Responsively echoes my blithe roundelay. THE MOONBEAM. The moonbeam on the Hudson sleeps, While yon enamored billow Delighted to the stranger creeps, And makes his breast her pillow. The rest, with dark and frowning mein, And jealous murmurs, languish, While amorous zephyrs pass the scene, And sigh with kindred anguish. So, when the fair Pastora's smile Her favored Lubin blessesâ Who steals a kiss, and plays the while With her unbraided tressesâ The shepherds who have wooed in vain, In sorrow doomed to languish, Behold the happy, envied swain, And sigh with jealous anguish. COME TO MY COT. I've a peaceful little cot, In a charming rural spot, Far removed from the town's busy hum, Where neither strife nor noise Can molest our placid joys, Oh then hither to my cot will you come? To my rural little cot will you come? Oh haste, my dearest maid, And enjoy the fragrant shade, To my rural little cot will you come? The honeysuckle there With its odor fills the air, And the fir lends its fragrant gum, While on every verdant spray Little songsters carol gay, Oh then hither to my cot will you come? To my rural little cot will you come? Oh haste, my dearest maid, And enjoy the fragrant shade, To my rural little cot will you come? Through the garden, and the mead Where the lambkins play and feed, Swells the honey-bee's tuneful hum, While the distant lowing kine, With the waterfall, combine To invite you to my cotâWill you come? To my rural little cot will you come? Oh haste, my dearest maid, And enjoy the fragrant shade, To my rural little cot will you come? And when the evening's shade Is extending over the glade, And the woodpecker ceases to drum, Then the pensive whip-poor-will, From the forest or the hill, Still invites you to my cotâWill you come? To my rural little cot will you come? Oh haste, my dearest maid, &amp;c. Dearest maiden, linger not, Come and share my peaceful lot, Far removed from the town's busy hum, For if Eden seemed a wild Until lovely woman smiled, Oh how can I be happy till you come? To my rural little cot will you come? Then haste, my dearest maid, And enjoy the fragant shade, To my rural little cot will you come? MORN OF MAY. Arise, my loveâthe sun appears To gild the infant day, His golden beam the landscape cheers, And nature smiles amid her tears, To greet the morn of May. Arise, my loveâthe lilac blooms, The blossomed peach is gay, The mead its flowery vest resumes, And freights the zephyr with perfumes, To cheer the morn of May. Oh! then ariseâ'tis love invites, Together let us stray; Thy form, which every charm unites, Shall lend a thousand new delights To gild the morn of May. THE COTTAGE LASS. The cottage lass, the courtly dame, The child of toil, and slave of fashion, Alike disown the mystic flame, Yet feed with sighs the tender passion. Each heart, ere age its fervor chills, Is doomed by turns to throb and languish, And prove the thousand nameless thrills Of bashful love's delicious anguish. But infant love attempts in vain To fan the flame with gilded pinion, And quickly bursts the heavy chain That ties him down to wealth's dominion. For ah! that flame but seldom lives In breasts with gaudy splendor laden, Nor yields them half the joy it gives The bashful, blooming, cottage maiden. THE PRIDE OF THE VALLEY. The pride of the valley is lovely young Ellen, Who dwells in a cottage enshrined by a thicket, Contentment and peace are the wealth of her dwelling, And truth is the porter that waits at the wicket. The zephyr that lingers on violet-down pinion, With spring's blushing honors delighted to dally, Ne'er breathed on a blossom in Flora's dominion, So lovely as Ellen, the pride of the valley. She 's true to her friend, and she 's kind to her mother, Nor riches nor honors can tempt her from duty; Content with her station she sighs for no other, Though fortunes and titles have knelt to her beauty. To me her affections and promise are plighted, Our ages are equal, our tempers will tally; Oh, moment of rapture! that sees me united To lovely young Ellen, the pride of the valley. DANCING GAYLY. Sweet the hour, when, freed from labor, Lads and lasses thus convene, To the merry pipe and tabor, Dancing gayly on the green. To the merry pipe and tabor, Dancing gayly on the green. Nymphs, with all their native graces, Swains with every charm to win, Sprightly steps, and smiling faces, Tell of happy hearts within. Sweet the hour, when, freed from labor, &amp;c. Blest with plenty, here the farmer Toils for those he loves alone, While some pretty smiling charmer, Like the land, is all his own. Sweet the hour, when, freed from labor, &amp;c. Though a tear for prospects blighted, May, at times, unbidden flow, Yet the heart will bound delighted, Where such kindred bosoms glow. Sweet the hour, when, freed from labor, &amp;c. THE BALM OF THE HEART. When the mild star of evening invites to the bower, Where music and mirth are to revel an hour, Dismiss gloomy care, and bid sorrow depart, For innocent mirth is the balm of the heart. Every pleasure is fleeting, and hastens away, The fairest blown rose is the first to decay; Then taste of its fragrance before it depart, For innocent mirth is the balm of the heart. Quickly hasten then hither, ye youth and ye fair, With eyes beaming pleasure, and hearts void of care; Partake of the joys which our revels impart, For innocent mirth is the balm of the heart. EVENING. 'Tis pleasant, when the world is still, And evening's mantle shrouds the vale, To hear the pensive whip-poor-will Pour her deep notes along the dale; While through the self-taught rustic's flute Wild warblings wake upon the gale, And from each thicket, marsh, and tree, The cricket, frog, and Katy-dee, With various notes assist the glee, Nor once through all the night are mute. The streamlet murmurs o'er its bed, The wanton zephyrs kiss its breast, Bid the green bulrush bend its head, And sigh through groves in verdure dressed; While Cynthia, from her silver horn, Throws magic shades o'er evening's vest; Sheds smiles upon the brow of night, Not dazzling, like day's shower of light, But soft as dew, which mocks the sight Till seen to sparkle on the thorn. I LOVE TO HEAR. I love to hear the flute's sweet notes, On zephyr's balmy pinion borne; While soft the melting cadence floats, And sighing echoes wake to mourn. Stealing on the raptured ear, At the closing hour of day, Wildly warbling, sweet and clear, Grateful as affection's tear, Then in murmurs die away. I love to hear, when blushing morn First tips the clouds with rosy hue, The new-waked lark salute the dawn, His matin song of praise renew. Singing as he skims the plain, Or directs his flight above; Waking all the tuneful train To begin the sylvan strain, Harmonizing every grove. I love to hear, when mid-day heat With listless languor fills the brain, Deep in some shady, cool retreat, The distant waterfall complain, As it leaps the craggy mound, Pouring down the rocky height, Foaming o'er the pebbled ground, While it sparkles on the sight. But when with her, whose image dwells Within my glowing breast, I stray, The music more divinely swells, The lark more sweetly tunes his lay; While beneath the shade we rove, Murmuring streamlets sooth the ear, Through the calm sequestered grove, Echo whispers only loveâ Cupids only hover near. YES OR NO. The groves their vernal sweets have lost, No blossoms now perfume the gale, The lawns are silvered o'er with frost, And autumn lingers in the vale. But do the seasons, as they roll, Affect the heart with joy and wo? Can autumn thus depress the soul: Or spring elate it?âYes, or no? The grove again shall yield its shade, And vernal sweets perfume the gale, The modest violet deck the glade, And richest verdure clothe the vale. But will the flower of hope survive, And gain from spring a brighter glow? A smile, sweet maid, would bid it thrive, Wilt thou bestow it?âYes, or no? GOOD-MORNING. The blushing precursor of PhÅbus expands The crystalline portals of light, And scatters the dew-dripping tints from her hands To crimson the mantle of night. Sleep shakes his soft pinions and soars to the sky. With rapture I greet my dear Jane, Whose health-glowing visage and love-beaming eye Aurora but mimics in vainâ âGood-morning!â Thy presence to me is the dawning of light, And pleasure illumines my breast; But, ah! in thy absence, morn changes to nightâ Hope sinks like the star of the west. Then let us, my fair one, the moments improve Which morning allows us for bliss, Let the new-risen day be devoted to love, And, in earnest, accept of a kissâ âGood-morning!â When evening returns, and in slumber I lie, Then fancy the scene shall retrace; Shall light up anew the soft glance of thine eye, And restore me thy blissful embrace. And when through the lattice Aurora's tints play, Oh fly to the arms of thy swain, With him taste the sweets of the infantile day, And hear him repeat, on the plainâ âGood-morning!â COME, LET US TRIP IT LIGHTLY. Come, let us trip it lightly, love, Where Flora's sweets are blending; The moon is beaming brightly, love, With starry lamps attending. The grove and hill, the mead and rill, Have charms that must delight thee, Then let us haste their sweets to taste, While zephyr's sighs invite thee. An hour like this imparts a bliss To souls of kindred feeling, A pure delight, serenely bright, Along the pulses stealing. The evening star is peeping, love, From yonder paler cluster, The glassy lake is sleeping, love, Enriched with borrowed lustre. The babbling brook, with brighter look, Meanders through the dingle; And chirping notes from insect throats, In tuneless measures mingle. An hour like this, which wakes to bliss, The hearts of meaner creatures, Must surely light a smile as bright On love's expressive features. SENTIMENTAL. TO MY WIFE. Nay, my all of joy that's left, Droop not thus in gloom, Lydia; Though each flower of hope be cleft, Other buds will bloom, Lydia; Never of the future borrowâ Though another storm of sorrow Rifle every leaf to-morrow From the thorny stem, Lydia, Let us with unshaken mind, Yield such toys, and be resigned, And, if nought but thorns we find, Make a toy of them, Lydia. Fortune must be blind indeed, We mistake her powers, Lydia, Else could love unheeded plead? Faithful love, like ours, Lydia? Let us, then, her gifts disdaining, Without murmur, or complaining, Or the will of Heaven arraigning, Fix our hopes above, Lydia; Though, while we are pilgrims here, Poverty may press severe, Yet we shall, through life, my dear, Still be rich in love, Lydia. Droop not, dearestâGod is kind When he seems severe, Lydia; Blessings yet remain behind Which we hold most dear, Lydia: Innocence the soul's best treasure, Mutual faith, disdaining measure, Love, and its appendant pleasure, What can these destroy, Lydia? These are ourâwith these endued, Nought should check our gratitude To the source of every good Mortals can enjoy, Lydia. THE SIGH. Softly stealing from her breast Ere its lovely keeper knew, Forth a sigh emerging flew: I received the trembling guest, Thrilling in my raptured ear, Sinking on my heart to rest, With ecstatic throbbings dear. Ah! dear Mary, luckless fair, You perceived its flight too late: Guard such tell-tale rogues with care; For the tidings which they bear Cast the color of our fate. Think you what it told my heart? 'T was the messenger of peace, Bidding every doubt to cease, Every sorrow to depart; 'T was the olive-bearing dove Guiding hope into the ark; 'T was the harbinger of love, Flitting from that warm recess Where thy thoughts in secret dwell: What thy lips would ne'er confess, Though thy suppliant sure to bless, This sweet fugitive will tell. Hark! it whispers to my heartâ âHope alone may revel here; Doubt and cold distrust depart. Hers as it responsive heaves, Shall confess the urchin's dart Rapture with the anguish leaves.â Tell me not I dream of bliss, If I do, still let me sleep, Snatch me not from joy like this The reality to miss; Never make a wretch to weep. A SMILE FROM THEE. A smile from thee would banish pain, And bid each doubt and sorrow flee, I ask but this, once more to gain A smile from thee. I 've sought thee long, with fruitless sighs, And were my bright reward to be A tender glance from those soft eyes, 'Twere heaven to me. A smile from thee would banish pain, &amp;c. But ah! if doomed no more to meet, Whate'er my future fate may be. This faithful heart will ever beat With love for thee. And when I close a life of pain, The gloomy hour of death will be An hour of bliss, if then I gain A tear from thee. A smile from thee would banish pain, &amp;c. THE WREATH OF LOVE. Let Fame her wreath for others twine, The fragrant wreath of love be mine, With balm-distilling blossoms wove; Let the shrill trumpet's hoarse alarms Bid laurels grace the victor's arms, Where havoc's blood-stained banners move; Be mine to wake the softer notes Where Acidalia's banner floats, And weave the gentler wreath of love. The balmy rose let stoics scorn, Let squeamish mortals dread the thorn, And fear the pleasing pain to prove; I'll fearless bind it to my heart, While every pang its thorns impart The floweret's balsam shall remove; For, sweetened by the nectared kiss, 'T is pain that gives a zest to bliss, And freshens still the wreath of love. Give me contentment, peace, and health, A moderate share of worldly wealth, And friends such blessings to improve; A heart to give when misery pleads, To heal or bind each wound that bleeds, And every mental pain remove; But with these giveâelse all denyâ The fair for whom I breathe the sigh, And wedlock be a wreath of love. Connubial bliss, unknown to strife, A faithful friendâa virtuous wife, Be mine for many years to prove: Our wishes one, within each breast The dove of peace shall make her nest, Nor ever from the ark remove; Till called to heaven; through ages there Be ours the blissful lot to wear A never-fading wreath of love. THE PORTRAIT. That tranquil brow, and pensive eye, Those parted lips of ruby dye; Each grace that life and reason give, Is kindling here, and seems to live! A playful smile illumes the cheek! Those rubies move!â't will speak!â't will speak! 'T was fancy all!âThat senseless bone Could ne'er be taught her dulcet tone; No art can teach that eye to move, Those ruby lips are dead to love. Illusive dream!âtoo soon it flies, The vision fades!âit dies!âit dies! LOVE'S LEGER. I own myself your debtor, love, For 't is to you my bliss I owe, Then say if I'd not better, love, Repay the balance kiss I owe? In justice you'll receipt it, love, And prove that you are true to me; If I should then repeat it, love, There'll be a balance due to me That little urchin Cupid, love, The only clerk we keep, you know, Is either blind or stupid, love, And apt to fall asleep, you know. 'T is best, then, thus to jog him, love, And make him earn his pay, you know; For, should we chide or slog him, love, The boy might run away, you know. The rogue possesses talents, love, His pinions furnish quills, you know, And when he strikes a balance, love, He must inspect our bills, you know. Then let us ne'er dispute, my love, While Time enjoyment rifles so, But take a kiss to boot, my love, I can not stand on trifles so. Short reck'nings make long friends, my love, Accounts should ne'er be running so, Then let us make amends, my love, For 't is unpleasant dunning so. Through life's allotted term, my love, If thus we do n't forget we owe, When death dissolves the firm, my love, We'll pay the only debt we owe. TO SOMEBODY. Oh I shall ne'er forget the spot Where smiles of joy were wont to greet me, Where ardent hearts dissembled not, But bounded with delight to meet me. Though rugged winter held his sway, And all without was cold and dreary, Yet, warmed by beauty's melting ray, I thought the season bright and cheery. But doomed, alas! too soon to part, And wander far from love and beauty, I felt a winter in my heart, And cheerless seemed the path of duty. I dragged along the heavy way A lengthened chain that make me weary, While Hope refused one glimmering ray To light a scene so dark and dreary. But see! at length stern winter flies, A brighter season glows before me, The summer radiance of those eyes Shall yet to life and joy restore me. Till then, let retrospection feed The flame which smiling hope should cherish, For, oh! how this poor heart would bleed, Should thine permit that flame to perish. THE GARLAND. I would a garland twine, my love, But nature's flowers decay, And ah! that brow of thine, my love, Deserves a fadeless bay. But song shall crown thee, listen! And let those eyes of fire With approbation glisten, Thy minstrel to inspire. 'T is not exterior charms, my love, That faultless shape and face, Those pearly polished arms, my love, That air of witching graceâ But 't is those mental treasures, Which few, alas! can claim, By which the poet measures Thy beauty, wit, and fame. Time dims the brightest eye, my love, That form will lose its grace, That cheek its vermeil dye, my love, And age will mark the face; But virtue, love, and duty, Retain immortal bloom, Survive the wreck of beauty, And decorate her tomb. TO A NOSEGAY. Little pledge of fond remembrance, Though thy tints so quickly flee, Still the lovely donor's semblance I can sweetly trace in thee. Here the rose and lily, twining, Her enchanting face bespeak; For the fairest hues, combining, Bloom upon her lovely cheek In this blushing pink which decked her, Glows an emblem of her lip, Both distilling balmy nectar, Both inviting mine to sip. In this violet I discover Her sweet eye's cerulean hue, Like the brightest star, above her, Sparkling in etherial blue. When within my bounding bosom Mary placed ye, thus entwined, Sweetly whispering, âdo not lose 'em,â Then what rapture filled my mind! But tyrannic Time is dooming All your lovely tints to fade; When you are no longer blooming, Can I longer trace the maid? Yes, when all your tints have faded, Fragrance still you will retain; Though your beauties be degraded, Charms internal will remain. Such is Maryâyouth is passingâ All her beauties must decay, But her mind is still amassing Charms to live an endless day. PEACEFUL HOME. The heart sustained by hope alone, The pains of absence may endure, But, ah! when even hope is flown, Its sorrow has no cure. 'T is then we sigh, where'er we roam, For our maternal, peaceful home. Though mourning like a mateless dove, The languid heart be doomed to beat, It can not, will not, cease to love, It finds the pain so sweet; Yet heaves a sigh, where'er we roam, For our maternal, peaceful home. LOVE AND JEALOUSY. When infant Cupid ventured first To spread his purple wing, It chanced he stopped, to slake his thirst, At the Pierian spring; When, rising from the crystal stream, A monster caught his eye, Poor Cupid started with a scream, But strove in vain to fly. To slay the little winged boy The demon vainly strove, His fangs could wound, but not destroy, The son of peerless Jove. He follows stillâ(they never part) But vainly vents his ire; Though jealous tortures wring the heart, Yet ne'er can love expire. MUSIC THE LANGUAGE OF LOVE. Yes, Love can discourse independent of eyes, The pressure of hands, or the breathing of sighs; Attend, then, its accents, and deign to approve, For MUSIC, dear girl, is the language of love. 'T is true that the eyes and the lips may impart A counterfeit sentiment, tutored by art; But nought can the pulses of sympathy move Like MUSIC, for that is the language of love. The tone of affection is framed in the soul, 'T is spirit, unfettered by matter's control; For what is the language of seraphs above, But MUSIC?âand there 't is the language of love. Then doubt, dearest maiden, professions and sighs, The glow of the hand, the expression of eyes; But doubt not the soul's aspirations, which prove, That MUSIC is still the true language of love. I LOVE ONLY THEE. Believe not the slanders that envy may frame, But confess, when the past you review, That though malice my couple reproach with his name, Dear Mary, thy Edwin is true. I will own that my heart flutters gayly, awhile, For every fair face that I see; But though ever delighted with woman's sweet smile, I love, dearly love, only thee. Repine not that festival joys may detain Thy lover awhile from thy arms; For with each sparkling goblet he ventures to drain, He whispers a toast to thy charms. I will own that, when friendship and evening invite, I join in such revels with glee; But thy smile can alone give me perfect delight, For I love, dearly love, only thee. LOVE'S EYES. Love's eyes are so enchanting, Bright, smiling, soft, and granting, Pulses play At every ray, And hearts at every glance are panting. Before the beamy eye of morn, We view the shades of night receding, So tender glances banish scorn, For who can frown while love is pleading? Love's eyes are so enchanting, &amp;c. No bandage can those eyes conceal, Though bards in fabled tales rehearse it; For if he wore a mask of steel, Affection's ardent gaze would pierce it. Love's eyes are so enchanting, &amp;c. Beware, then, lest some artful elf The infant's smiles and armor borrow, To win a throb of joy for self, And give his victim years of sorrow. Love's eyes are so enchanting, Bright, smiling, soft, and granting, Pulses play At every ray, And hearts at every glance are panting. LOVE AND VALOR. Sounds of war were swelling wild, Fearful notes the bugle blew; Infant Love, a timid child, Trembled at the rat-tat-too. But inspired by Valor's breath, Love with war familiar grew, Fearless view the strife of death, Smiled to hear the rat-tat-too. Swift a shaft at Valor's heart From the infant's bow-string flew; Valor heeded not the dart, List'ning to the rat-tat-too. Yet that dart was tipped with red, Ella's heart-blood lent the hue; But in vain had Ella bled, Valor loved the rat-tat-too. Through the camp the infant strayed, Hope receding now from view; Secret griefs his sighs betrayed, Mingling with the rat-tat-too. Valor will not yield to Love, Hope to Ella bids adieu; Sad, desponding, widowed dove, Listless to the rat-tat-too. A KISS. Does Eliza remember, ere fashion had taught her To lend the heart's impulse hypocrisy's guise, How oft, in our plays, to my bosom I caught her, And wondered a touch could so brighten the eyes? Familiar to me is the sweet recollection, I well can remember the thrill and the glow, The flush and the smile that illumed her complexion, Like the first ray of morning reflected on snow. And I asked what it was that the senses thus raptured, And bade through my pulses such ecstacies roll, The charm which reflection bewildered and capturedâ A KISS was the answerâit melted my soul. GIVING AND RECEIVING. The suppliant departed, while gratitude's tear In his joy-beaming eye was suspended; My heart bounded light, for my Lydia was near, Who thus the donation commended: âThe bosom which softens at Misery's wound, And proffers the balsam to heal him, With the glow of contentment must joyfully bound, And such is the breast of my Selim.â âBut which,â I exclaimed, as the fair one I pressed, While her eye with affection was brightened, âReceiver, or donor, which think you most blest? Whose joy by the action most heightened?â âThe being,â she answered, âyou saved from despair, Who tastes, by the sudden reversion, Of exquisite bliss a porportionate share, To the depth of his recent immersion.â Her answer was sweetened with love's nectared kiss, And my breast with the transport was heaving, As I owned, with a sigh, that though giving was bliss, It was faint to the joy of receiving. TO MARIA. Awake again thy witching lyre, Its tones have slept too long; But thy sweet touches, dear Maria, Can call a spirit from the wire, With eyes of light and lips of fireâ Oh wake him into song. Why should the sweetest gift of Jove In useless silence lie, When thou canst make it speak and move, To charm our grief, inspire our love, And raise our thoughts to things above, Why, sweet Mariaâwhy? Why brood o'er past affliction's smart, With sad and tearful eye, When thine is the bewitching art, The sweetest rapture to impart, And kindle joy in every heart, Why, loved Mariaâwhy? AND DID I UPBRAID YOU? And did I upbraid you, my love? Oh pardon a fault I deplore; For while you thus sweetly reprove, I feel I can never doubt more. NoânoânoâI shall never doubt you more. I own I suspected your truth, And envied a rival's success; For jealousy pictured a youth Whom pity would prompt you to bless. Whom pityâpityâpity would prompt you to bless. And did I upbraid you, my love? Oh pardon a fault I deplore; For while you thus sweetly reprove, I feel I can never doubt more. NoânoânoâI shall never doubt you more. My doubts I now give to the wind, For Mary is constant and fair, Though lately I thought her unkind, And gave myself up to despair. Despairâdespairâdespairâand gave myself up to despair. And did I upbraid you, my love? Oh pardon a fault I deplore; For while you thus sweetly reprove, I feel I can never doubt more, NoânoânoâI shall never doubt you more. NATURE AND THE PASSIONS. The stranger awoke, and with wonder surveyed The unexplored regions on which she was thrown: Rude Chaos the sceneâand the infantile maid Was Nature, just risen from sources unknown. Her form, the fair abstract of Infinite thought, The unblemished model of harmony moved; Her accents the spirit of melody taught, Her smile was celestialâand Heaven approved. But scarce could the infant existence admire, When hosts of rude demons encountered the child, Revenge and rough Anger, with optics of fire, And frenzy-struck Terror, shrieked horribly wild. Attended by Rapine, fell Murder appeared, Led onward by Avarice, Malice, and Hate; Their snaky crests Envy and Jealousy reared, As blood-stained Ambition tore laurels from fate. This phalanx of fiends, with Despair in their train, With scourges of scorpions the infant assailed, And pitiless heard the sweet stranger complain, Deep deluged in sorrow which nothing availed. Compassion beheldâand to regions above, In the incense of sighs, her petition conveyed; Infinity heard, and the answer wasâLOVE, Who came in the garb of an angel arrayed. Her presence made cruel Ambition depart, Hate, Murder, and Rapine, the goddess confessed; Her touch palsied Malice, and blunted his dart, And even lank Avarice opened his breast. She spokeâand Revenge was subdued by the charm; She smiledâand the scene was deserted by Fear; She sighedâand pale Jealousy fled with alarm; She weptâand rough Anger dissolved in the tear. Her magic the vulture transformed to a dove, And Nature again was delighted and blestâ Thus each ruder passion is subject to Love, The genius that tempers and governs the rest. I HAD A LYRE. I had a lyre when hope was young, But 'twas the plaything of a child; Of LOVE I then delighted sung, And swept its chords with transport wild. But now its tones I can not swell, Its spirit and its voice have fled, That lyre is but a tuneless shell, For I have sold its chords for BREAD. THE MEETING. I saw them meetâthe pangs of absence o'er, And Memory holds a picture of the place: 'T was at the threshold of her cottage door, Eliza met her husband's warm embrace. How animated shone her eager eye, Where joy's delicious tear suspended hung! Her bosom heavedâbut pleasure raised the sigh Her voice was muteâbut bliss had sealed her tongue. Pressed in his arms, the chaste connubial kiss Her ruby lips by turns received and gave; Then, as ashamed of the excessive bliss, Affection's blush she bids his bosom save. But recollection whispered yet a joy 'T was hers to give; and from the trance she starts, Puts in his arms their little infant boy, Love's precious pledge, that closer binds their hearts. While round their sire the elder prattlers cling; Beg for a kiss; their little tales recite; Each emulous some trifling boon to bring, And share their parents' unalloyed delight. Forgotten now is separation's smart, Or but remembered as the zest of joy; Her smiles are sunshine to his gladdened heart, Which love-created fears no more annoy. So, wrapped in night, the lonely pilgrim views Aurora, blushing, throw her veil aside; And, filled with joy, his lighted path pursues, Whence erst bewildered he had wandered wide. And is it joy that fills my eye? I criedâ Ah, no!âregret, that such was not my lot; But yet to envy 't was so near allied, I blushedâand sighing, left the happy spot. A DREAM. Oh stay, sweet vision! lovely phantom, stay! And longer bless me with thy mimic show: Ah! fade not thus to empty air away, And leave a wretch awake to real wo. And did I dream? Oh! 't was a dream so sweet, So full of bliss, that heaven had lost its charms; And I embraced the dear delusive cheat, Then woke, and found despair within my arms. Joy's sparkling goblet seems to overflow, Her banquet now with tempting sweets appears; But, ah! I wake to quaff the cup of wo, Drink deep of grief, and feast upon my tears. THE SMILE OF LOVE. Yes, there's a light whose effulgence can brighten Grief's gloomy aspect with sparkles of joy, Chase from the heart which its splendors enlighten Each sombre care that presumes to annoy. Pure are its rays, as the dawn's first reflection, Grateful as sunbeams when tempests are o'er, Oh 't is the smile of an artless affection, Beaming from eyes and a heart we adore. Dark fate may vainly lower, O'er hope's enamelled bower, The smile of affection each cloud will remove, That warm celestial ray melts cloudy care away, Earth has no charm like the sweet smile of love. While through this life's dusky vale we are straying, Pressed by misfortune, and harassed by fears, Sighing o'er pictures of fancy, decayingâ Sprinkling our pathway with unheeded tears, Be but the lustre of love's radiations Shed o'er the scene, and its terrors will cease, Sighs will be changed into joy's aspirations, Tears be converted to dew-drops of peace. Bright beam of heavenly bliss! Earth has no charm like this, 'T is the reflection of light from above: When first we feel the ray, how sweet the pulses play! Earth has no charm like the sweet smile of love. I HEARD A SWEET STRAIN. I heard a sweet strain in the grove, And listened with breathless delight: âAs pensive I thought on my love, âThe moon on the mountain shone bright.â When torn from the arms of her swain, In circles of splendor to move, Sweet Fatima thus would complain, As pensive she thought on her love. A palace for her had no charms, Unshared by the youth she adored; But pressed in her loved Selim's arms, A cottage true bliss could afford. Then should fickle Fortune ordain, Your Selim from hence to remove, Will you, while you warble that strain, Bestow a fond thought on your love? Some seraph will waft me the sound, And whisper the joy to my heart; Though absence must cruelly wound, I'll listen, forgetting its smart. Then grant that such joy I may find, Should fate ever tear me from thee; For me let the strain be designedâ Be Fatima only to me. HARRIET'S FAVORITE POEMS. When I survey my Harriet's speaking face, The smiles that light, the tears that fill her eyes, The frown of anger, or the rose's grace, I view the Seasons in succession rise. When a glance of affection her optics impart, The Pleasures of Hope are alive in my heart. Lost in the theme, while bending o'er her lyre, She wakes the tones which fascinate the soul, I view the Minstrel that I most admire, And list in rapture while her numbers roll. When, absent, I yield to reflection's sweet power, The Pleasures of Memory shorten the hour. If she, with fondness, chide my ardent kiss, And, with a soft'ning smile, forbearance ask, Or bid me, with a frown, forego the bliss, I bow submission, but neglect the Task. For should she condemn me the bliss to forego, In the Grave would I seek for an end of my wo. When Fancy through her own creation strays, To promised joy delighting still to cling, From her alone, my glowing bosom says, The Pleasures of Imagination spring. But when Curiosity rises to vex, Then Paradise Lost I impute to the sex. I told her thusâwhen, in her snowy arms, My yielding form the angel gently strained. And I, bewildered with a maze of charms, Sighed in her earâ't is Paradise Regained! Retired from elysium, the scene to retrace, My Night Thoughts re-pictured the tender embrace. MABELLA. The world is no longer the desert I deemed it, While clouds of affliction had veiled it in gloom, For the promise of Hopeâthough I lightly esteemed it, For once has been faithful, and dressed it in bloom. The eye of pure friendship is lighted to bless me, And LoveâOh the truest of hearts is my own; E'en Fame grows propitious, and deigns to caress me, All smile on the minstrel, but Fortune alone. Pure friendshipâit beams from the eye of Mabella, The angel of mercy, and daughter of song; It lights up a zenith so brilliantly stellar, I spurn the dull planet to which I belong. But, ah! should a cloud rise again to obscure it, Exhaled in the malice of Calumny's breath, The sensitive pulse of my heart would endure it A momentâand then find a refuge in death. THE VOYAGE OF LIFE. Embarked on the ocean of life, I steered for the haven of bliss; But through passion's tempestuous strife, My reck'ning was ever A-MISS. Near Pleasure's enchanted domain I plunged in a whirlpool of care, Encountered the breakers of pain, And struck on the rocks of despair. Afloat and refitted once more, The chart of experience my guide, Hope points to the far-distant shore, Her smile bids the tempest subside. No breakers or quicksands I fear, While Honor stands firm at the helm; By the compass of reason I'll steer To Joy's delectable realm. Stern Virtue the port may blockade, Yet Hymen will sanction my right, And his torch, like a pharos, shall aid To moor in the stream of delight. Then, then, may the genius of Love An eternal embargo declare; I'll never evade it, by Jove! Nor traffic in contraband ware. THE GAMUT. The demon care constrained to smile, When matchless Ida sings, Repents that he my lyre should spoil, And gives me back its strings; So Orpheus' lay (as poets dreamed) With like resistless spell, Subdued the Fates, and thus redeemed Eurydice from hell. Once more I'll tune this shell so dear, And stretch its wires again, Till A awake with accents clear, And breathing B complain. The C shall sound serene and free, The D with danger toy, While fiery, wild, erratic E, Shall light the torch of joy. The F give love and feeling scope, But G with grief shall wail, For H, the aspirate of hope, Comes not within the scale. 'Tis done!âmy lyre shall wake again, While lovely Ida sings, For 't was her sweet resistless strain Redeemed the minstrel's strings. TO HARRIET. I own I chid the plaintive strain, Nor wished the muse to weep; But I recall a thought so vain, If Harriet's lyre must sleep. What though its tones are sorrow's sighs, 'T is bliss those tones to hear; And should they drown the listener's eyes, They still would charm his ear. Then, Harriet, tune thy âsimple lyre,â And sing of blessings fled, While such ecstatic joys its wire On other hearts can shed. Yes, still with sorrow's lay alarm, Be Penserosa still, For if thy tones of grief thus charm, Thy notes of joy would kill. AND MAY I HOPE? And may I hope? thou kind one, oh! Can joy so great be mine? I 'd pass a thousand years of wo, Nor think the minutes travelled slow, Might I, at last, be thine. And may I hope?âWhat rapture waits On that auspicious word! Now do your worst, ye envious fates, The sentence which my soul elates, Attesting angels heard. And may I hope?âThen I am blest, That word expels despair, Removes each sorrow from my breast, With every doubt that dare molest, And plants an Eden there. And may I hope?âThen fancy may Foretaste the nuptial kiss, In promised rapture revel gay, An antepast of that sweet day, Which consummates my bliss. TO CAROLINE. Though thousand gems, of dazzling ray, Will glow and sparkle through the day, The diamond only has the power To shine in midnight's darkest hour; So hearts that bask in beauty's smile, With borrowed ray may glow awhile, But mine, dear girl, is warm and bright, Though absence shroud the gem in night. Yes, absence is affection's test, I feel the truth within my breast; For every hour and every mile, That bars me from thy cheering smile, Imparts new ardor to the flame, That warms and animates my frame; But ere it too intensely burn, In pity, love, return!âreturn. WE ARE ONE. Oh, we are one, and who presumes To sever hearts like ours, Would scatter frosts where Eden blooms, And wither all its flowers; But should no bands unite our hands, Till weary life be done, The ties which join this heart to thine, Will ever make us one. Yes, pride and rank may sever hands, But can not change the heart, Nor polar snows, nor Afric's sands, Congenial spirits part. Our souls shall meet, in union sweet, Though seas between us run, Till pride relents, and fate consents, To make us truly one. RETURNING HOME. No longer shall fortune be whelmed with invective, If my journey the goddess but bless with her smile; I heed not its length, while I view in perspective The sharer, rewarder, and end of my toil. Ah! still on my vision the object increases! The cottage of peace and affection I spy! Hope smiles, as my bosom, unconscious, releases The murmur of wishes respired in a sigh. Now, now I am blest!âBut, ah! language it fails me, No pencil can paint love's ecstatic alarms: 'T is she that approachesâ't is Catharine hails me, She gazes! she smiles!âI am pressed in her arms. BANKRUPTCY OF THE HEART. Let infamy cover the dastard, that meanly Can sport with the peace of an innocent maid, For there is no pang which the heart feels so keenly As finding its confidence basely betrayed. No power can retrive such a wide desolation, As spreads o'er the face of the mental creation, When once a sincere trusting heart's adoration Has been with a cold-blooded treason repaid. For woman, dear woman, ne'er traffics by measure, But risks her whole heart, without counting the cost; And if the dear youth whom she trusts with the treasure Be shipwrecked, or faithless, her capital's lost. For all she was worth, was her stock of affection, And bankruptcy follows, with sad retrospection, And nothing can ever remove the dejection That preys on a bosom whose prospects are crossed. A NUPTIAL SONG. Oh blest is the festival hallowed by duty, The banquet which Hymen and Cupid supply, The goblet which borrows new lustre from beauty, Its tints from her lip, and its light from her eye. Then join in our revels, partake of our pleasures, For Hymen and Love here in union preside, While Music awakens her light-footed measures, To welcome the guests, and to honor the bride. While a spot in the desert of life is thus blooming, And soft sighs of rapture are fanning its bowers, While the sunbeams of mirth are its vistas illuming, And bright tears of ecstacy water the flowersâ Oh join in our revels, partake of our pleasures, For Hymen and Love here in union preside, While Music awakens her light-footed measures, To welcome the guests, and to honor the bride. Long life to their pleasures, till raptures supernal, Immortal as truth, in their bosoms shall rise, For the bliss of true conjugal love is eternal, It blossoms on earth but to bloom in the skies. Then join in our revels, partake of our pleasures. For Hymen and Love here in union preside, While Music awakens her light-footed measures, To welcome the guests, and to honor the bride. THE WIDOWED IVY. I marked of late, in verdant pride, The ivy, fondly clinging To the tall oak's majestic side, On whose green branches, spreading wide, A woodland choir was singing. But soon was hushed the sylvan lay, The lightning's bolt invaded; The oak was shivered in the fray, The widowed ivy lost its stay, And all its verdure faded. 'T is thus the fond, confiding heart On manly faith reposes, While the sweet smiles of Hope impart Such hues to life's prospective chart As deck the scene in roses. But, ah! such sweets too soon decay, By sorrow's storm invaded; If faithless man our hopes betray, The widowed heart will lose its stay, And all its joys be faded. CHRISTMAS GAMBOLS. Hail the season of joy and festivity, Social pleasures and innocent mirth, Consecrated by Mercy's Nativity, Bliss angelical granted to earth! Tempests of winter the forests may splinter, But never can stint or embitter our cheer, While love's soft wishes still sweeten our dishes, On merry Christmas and happy New Year. Hark! the merry bells, chiming from Trinity, Charm the ear with their musical din, Telling all, throughout the vicinity, Holyday gambols are now to begin: Friends and relations, with fond salutations, And warm gratulations, together appear; While lovers and misses, with holyday kisses, Greet merry Christmas and happy New Year. Gratitude, united with piety, Bids each bosom with rapture to glow, Pleasures, tempered with cheerful sobriety, âLight up smiles in the aspect of wo:â Sires and mothers, meet sisters and brothers, And mingle with others, in festival cheer: And friends, long parted, assemble, light-hearted, On merry Christmas and happy New Year. Now commences the infantile revelry, Happy urchins the story believe, That Santa Claus, since ages of chivalry, Visits the nursery on holyday eve. Socks, intended for gifts, are suspended, And mystic rites blended, the fancy to cheer, While sweet snap-dragon, exhausts the full flagon, Each merry Christmas and happy New Year. Then hail the season of joy and festivity, Social pleasures, and innocent mirth! Which smooths the path of age's declivity, And gives to infancy Eden on earth; When Plenty her treasure bestows without measure, And innocent Pleasure pursues her career; While Love's soft wishes still sweeten our dishes, On merry Christmas and happy New Year. LAND'S END. The gale was propitious, all canvass was spread, As swift through the water we glided, The tear-drop yet glistened which friendship had shed, Though the pang whence it sprang had subsided. Fast faded in distance each object we knew, As the shores which we loved were retiring, And the last grateful object which lingered in view, Was the beacon on land's end aspiring. Ah! here, I exclaimed, is an emblem of life, For 't is but a turbulent ocean, Where passion with reason is ever at strife, While our frail little barks are in motion. The haven of infancy, calm and serene, We leave in the distance retiring, While memory lingers, to gaze on some scene, Like the beacon on land's end aspiring. Oh may I be careful to steer by that chart Which Wisdom in mercy has given, And true, like the needle, this tremulous heart Be constantly pointing to heaven; Thus safely with tempests and billows I'll cope, And find (when at last they 're subsiding) On the land's end of life is a beacon of hope, To the harbor of happiness guiding. THE TEAR OF GRATITUDE. There is a gem more pearly bright, More dear to Mercy's eye, Than love's sweet star, whose mellow light First cheers the evening sky; A liquid pearl, that glitters where No sorrows now intrude, A richer gem than monarchs wear, The tear of gratitude. But ne'er shall narrow love of self, Invite this tribute forth, Nor can the sordid slave of pelf Appreciate its worth; But ye who sooth the widow's wo, And give the orphan food, For you this liquid pearl shall flow, The tear of gratitude. Ye, who but slake an infant's thirst, In Heavenly Mercy's name, Or proffer penury a crust, The sweet reward can claim. Then as ye rove life's sunny banks, With sweetest flowerets strewed, Still may you claim the widow's thanks, The orphan's gratitude. SPRING AND AUTUMN. How pleasing, how lovely appears Sweet infancy, sportive and gay; Its prattle, its smiles, and its tears, Like spring, or the dawning of day! But manhood 's the season designed For wisdom, for works, and for use; To ripen the fruits of the mind, Which the seeds sown in childhood produce. TO ADELAIDE FELICITY. Before thy infant lips could frame, With lisping tone, a parent's name; When first a smile of playful grace Was seen upon thy cherub face; While dandled on thy mother's kneeâ Think'st thou that smile was dear to me? 'T was, AdelaideâFelicity. When thou, at last, couldst run alone, And lisp our names with dulcet tone; And like the lamb, in frolic play, Didst wile the laughing hours away; Thy father's bosom throbbed with glee, While love maternal guarded thee, 'T was, AdelaideâFelicity. But ah! how faint a joy was this, Compared with our superior bliss, When, budding in the spring of youth, Replete with virtue, love, and truth, And every grace we wished to see, Thy doting parents gazed on theeâ 'T was, AdelaideâFelicity. And when with cultivated mind, By knowledge stored, by art refined, Thy faithful heart, thy hand, thy will, Were pledged to one who holds them still, One who is worthy even thee, What think you, owed the youth to me? 'T was, AdelaideâFelicity. And now, thy lengthened absence o'er, I hold thee in my arms once more, And kiss the pearls of joy away, And see the smiles of rapture play About the lips from sorrow free, What, thinkst thou, calls this tear from me? 'T is, AdelaideâFelicity. TO MISS SARAH HOWARD. I asked the muse to breathe a name Which Mercy loved the dearest; The brightest on the roll of fame, To perfect worth the nearest; Whose heart would bleed, but never shrink, When gloom and danger lowered, Who dared destruction's awful brink, To save the wretch about to sinkâ She smiled and whisperedââHoward.â I asked her then to name a fair, Whose thousand traits of beauty, Derive the sweetest grace they wear From virtue, love, and duty: Who, when her parents helpless lay, By fell disease o'erpowered, With tearless, sleepless eye, would stay To watch their couches, night and day, The pangs of sickness to allayâ The muse still whisperedââHoward.â THE KALEIDOSCOPE. Just like Hope, this magic toy Shows a thousand forms of joy, Of richest shape and sweetest hue, For ever varyingâever new, Just like Hope. Innocence, a playful child, Raised the tube, and looked, and smiled, And still he gazed, with rapture wild, For every change his heart beguiled, Just like Hope. Sage Experience chanced to pass, Seized the toy, and broke the glass, And soon convinced the weeping boy How false was his illusive joy, Just like Hope. Still the silly child believed That his loss would be retrieved, Another tried, and still he grieved, For every flattering tube deceived, Just like Hope. Just like Hope, this magic toy Shows a thousand forms of joy, Of richest shape and sweetest hue, For ever varyingâever new, Just like Hope. THE IMPRISONED DEBTOR. The slave inhales the morning's healthful breeze, And gambols gayly o'er the verdant plain; But ah! the debtor tastes no joys like these, But breathes the fetid atmosphere of pain. The slave has friendsâa wife and children dear, Whose fond caresses every grief dispel; But ah! no friendâno wife or child is near, To bless the debtor's solitary cell. Near the sad couch on which his Emma weeps, Her sickly fancy paints his wasting frame; And from the cradle where her infant sleeps, Unconscious lips pronounce a father's name. Alas, poor babe! thy father hears thee not; In the cold jail his lonely lamp he trims, To wake and muse upon our hapless lot, The chains of avarice clanking on his limbs. But though, my child, our eyes dissolve in showers, Our cheeks are strangers to the blush of shame, For oh! one boast, one legacy is oursâ His spotless honor and unblemished fame. THE FLOWERS OF LIFE. In the journey of life, let us scorn to complain of The trifling impediments found in the road; The worst I encounter I laugh at the pain of, For sweet-smiling cheerfulness lightens the load. If I find not a rose, I indulge not in sorrow, But pluck with contentment a daisy to-day; Nay, even a sprig will feed hope for to-morrow, The humblest that nods to the zephyrs of May. Let others dispute, I'll avoid their dissention, Religious, political, moral, or such; For the lily of peace thus escapes their attention, The sweet bud of pleasure which blooms at my touch. The blossoms of friendship, surviving mortality, I'll carefully cherish and wear in my breast; Though its picture may boast brighter hues than reality, Its fragrance directs me, when doubtful the test. The spirit of feeling, the soul of affection, Wildly ardent in rapture, and melting in wo, Whatever its image, attire, or complexion, With mine shall commingle in sympathy's glow. I ask not his birthplace, whatever the region, Hot, temperate, frigidâdespotic or free; I ask not his politics, creed, or religion, A Turk, Jew or Christianâhe 's still dear to me. But ah! there 's a flower, which, teeming with nectar, Beneath its fair aspect screen's misery's dart, So artfully veiled that it mocks a detecter, Till, pressed to the bosom, it pierces the heart. But still, to a bosom susceptibly placid, The anguish of love will but heighten the joy; As the bev'rage uniting a sweet with an acid, Is grateful, when nectar untempered would cloy. The bramble of avarice others may nourish, Exhausting life's soil of its virtues and strength; I'll stray where the plants of beneficence flourish, And the generous vine winds its serpentine length. Let misers pursue their mean sordid employment, And hoard up their treasures for life's latest scenes; I'll waste not the moments allowed for enjoyment, Nor squander the season in gaining the means. Our object is happinessâne'er could we miss it, In life's varied path, if the talent were ours From all we encounter some good to elicit, As bees gather sweets from the meanest of flowers. Then pluck every blossom of happiness blooming; Leave birds of contention, and play with the dove; And our path, soon the flush of enchantment assuming, Will glow, an elysium of pleasure and love. EDWIN DELISLE. The battle was ended, whose direful commotion Gave tyrants the victims unclaimed by the wave, And the last ray of PhÅbus illumined the ocean, As it shot o'er the land of the ill-fated brave. The western breeze wafted the ship o'er the main, Far, far from their country and liberty's smile; Each captive enshackled with tyranny's chain, The noblest of whom was young Edwin Delisle. Apart from his comrades, his manly breast bleeding With anguish too piercing for nature to bear, Distracted he viewed his dear country receding, And bade it adieu in a tone of despair: âOh region of happiness, freedom, and peace! Columbia, adieu! not for Edwin you smile, For soon, with his sorrows, existence must cease, For rent is the heart of poor Edwin Delisle. âEliza! my angel! fate dooms us to sever, Though brought to the climate that fosters thy charms; In sight of my country, I lose it for ever, In view of my love, I am torn from her arms! Three times have the seasons their circle fulfilled, Since Edwin was blest with affection's sweet smile, Since, pressed to his bosom, Eliza be held, As she sighed a farewell to her Edwin Delisle. ââThree years shall restore me,â I cried, as we parted; The term has expired, and my eyes caught the shore; Hope flatter'd, then left to despair, broken-hearted, The wretch for whom freedom and joy are no more. The shadows of eve shroud thy land from my view, But ah! there 's another where joys ever smile! God of mercy, forgive me!âEliza, adieu!â He plungedâand the waves covered Edwin Delisle. FRIENDSHIP. What power can prop a sinking soul, Oppressed with woes and sick of grief, Bid the warm tear forbear to roll, Despair's heart-rending sigh control, And whisper sweet relief? Friendship! sweet balm for sorrow's smart, In thee the soothing power is found, To heal the lacerated heart, Extract affliction's venomed dart, And close the bleeding wound. When pierced by grief's chill tempest through, The tendril bends beneath its power, Thou canst the broken plant renew: Thy sacred tear, like heavenly dew, Revives the drooping flower. If fortune frownâif health depart, Or death divide the tenderest tie, Friendship can raise the sinking heart, A glow of real joy impart, And wipe the tearful eye. If foes without attack our name, Or foes within assault our peace, Then friendship's pure celestial flame, Can sooth the mindâdefend our fame, And bid assailants cease. Come, then, sweet power, of source divine, For ever glow within my breast; My earliest friend be ever mine, One link our hearts in union join, To make each other blest. HIBERNIA'S TEARS. Hibernia's tears for ever flow, Her harp in silence slumbers; Her bards the patriot song forego, Nor dare to breathe its numbers. No more they bid the swelling tone In freedom's cause awaken; Those happy days of bliss are flown, And Erin weeps, forsaken! But though her sons in exile roam, They sleep on freedom's pillow; And Erin's daughters find a home Beyond the western billow. There shall they breathe the glowing strain, To joy's ecstatic numbers; There Erin's harp shall wake again, In rapture, from its slumbers. CALUMNY. Ah, what avails the shield of truth, The charm of virtue, beauty, youth, Against that fiend deformed, uncouth, Whose wounds no lenient balm can close? Assailed by Slander's venomed tooth, The sensate mind must droop, forsooth, And wither like a cankered rose. Yes, they who ever felt the pang Of Calumny's inveterate fang, Must own that minstrel never sang, Of all the woes from guilt that sprang, Of deeper, dreader, deadlier foes. Oh thou, who hast been thus betrayed By secret foes, in ambush laid, To plot and stab beneath the shade; Whose viewless shafts have mocked the aid Of Virtue's buckler to evade The cruel, pointed, venomed barbâ Know, hapless wretch! whoe'er thou be, There is between thyself and me A sighing chord of sympathy; For I have also felt, like thee, The cureless wounds of Calumny, Who kissed and stabbedâfor heâfor he Had stolen honest Friendship's garb. But what, alas, avails complaint? Be man more holy than a saint, Be lovely woman âchaste as snow And pure as ice,â they still must know The keenest pang of human wo, The rankling wound of Calumny. But hear a Saviour's accents mild, âThe persecuted and reviled Are blessed,â saith the Lord. Then still, in conscious virtue clad, âRejoice, and be exceeding glad, For great is your reward.â OH TRUST NOT HOPE. Oh trust not faithless Hope too far, Lest disappointment's venomed dart Should all thy fairest prospects mar, And lacerate thy constant heart; For I have trusted in her smile, Nor heard the distant thunder roll, Nor saw the cloud approach the while, Whose lightnings since have pierced my soul. Oh trust not, then, the smile of hope, A hurricane succeeds the calm, E'en while we stroll some verdant slope Where flow'rets freight the breeze with balmâ Ere we can say âthe scene is sweet,â 'T is blasted by some demon's breath; Then trust not, trust not, I entreat, The treacherous smile that lures to death. AN IMITATION FROM THE FRENCH. All hues become a pretty face, For beauty needs no foreign grace; A flower, or anything, in truth, Will ornament the brow of youth, While sparkling gems may vainly shine Where age and ugliness combine. Oh then, be wise, ye gentle fair, And all the ornaments you wear From taste, instead of wealth, obtain, Nor longer court your glass in vain. The Prize of Beauty (once decreed, To Paphian Venus, as we read) Was not awarded to the fair For any brilliants in her hair. No, 't was her native charms acquired The prize her rivals so desired; Her face, her neck, her bosom, waist, Her easy negligence and taste, Her attitude, her hair, her eyesâ With these the goddess won the prize. Oh then, ye fair, who seek to please, Cherish simplicity and ease; With modest taste, give no occasion To quote Apelles' observation. An ignorant painter having decorated the portrait of Helen with trinkets, Apelles observed, that the picture was ârich in ornaments, but poor in beauty,â and that the âartist had embellished her with jewels, because he had not abilities to paint her beautiful.â Remember, that a grace denied, Was by a bauble ne'er supplied. THE DEAF AND DUMB. The ills which call for pity's tear, Were all in mercy given; The fettered tongue, obstructed ear, And every wo we suffer here, Invite us back to Heaven. But he who binds the bleeding heart By sorrow's tempest riven, Whose kindness dries the tears that start, Performs a man's, an angel's part, And aids the plan of Heaven. Then see the tear from misery's cheek, By love and genius driven! Behold! they gain the end they seek! The deaf can hear! the dumb can speak! And praise approving Heaven. And now a bright and glorious morn Succeeds a dusky even; The dazzled soul, but newly born, In wonder lost, salutes the dawn, And hails the sun of heaven. BEAUTY, SWEET MYSTERIOUS POWER. Beauty, sweet mysterious power, Secret spring of all that moves, Goddess of the Paphian bower, Mother of the infant loves; Which can make the wicked good, Savage sentiments abolish, Melt the hard, refine the rude, Teach the clown a courtier's polish; Which can make the simple wise, Or deprive the wise of reason; Bid the statesman sink or rise, Urge to loyalty or treason:â Now exciting modest fear, Now with lawless rudeness firing; Prompting to be faithless here, There with constancy inspiring. 'T is the power that banes or blesses; Where shall we its image find? 'T is the nymph whose eye expresses Charms belonging to the mind. THE MINSTREL. How happy is the minstrel's lot, Whose song each care beguiles; The frowns of fortune fright him not, Nor does he court her smiles. Contented with his tuneful lyre, His art can yield the rest; He pours his soul along the wire, And rapture fires his breast. He envies not the power of kings, With all their glittering toys; The tones that warble from his strings Impart sublimer joys. He builds a world of airy bliss, Where love erects his throne; And though his fancy frame the kiss, Its sweets are all his own. What though no wealth his song repays, Nor laurels deck his lyre; The glow he catches from its lays Is bliss supremely higher. What though his fairy pleasures seem Illusion's shapeless toysâ He would not lose so sweet a dream For all your waking joys. A DUETT BOTH. Now the torch of rapture burns, Sorrows fly, and joy returns; Hope, in blushing garlands drest, Comes again, a welcome guest. SHE. So the gloomy shades of night HE. Fade before the dawn of light; SHE. Till Aurora's blushing ray BOTH. Kindle darkness into day. CONFIDING WOMAN. Confiding woman yields her heart Without a reservation, While man can only love by art, And sordid calculation. No earthly ill can him annoy, But she would gladly bear it, Nor has the world for her a joy, Unless her lover share it. HARLEM MARY. They sing of blue-eyed Mary, Who gathered flowers to sell, But there 's a sweeter fairy, In Harlem's flowery dell; Whose violets, pinks, and roses, Display a richer bloom, 'T were bliss to gain such posies, And taste their rich perfume. The violet's softest azure Is swimming in her eye; The rose's vermeil treasure, On either cheek we spy; The fragrant pink's carnation, Its nectar and perfume, In sweetest combination, Have dressed her lips in bloom. And she has learned to cherish A never-fading flower; When pinks and roses perish 'T will still adorn her bower; Its tints will never vary, Its fragance ne'er depart, 'T will always bloom with Mary, 'T is planted in her heart. THE BASHFUL LOVER. When bashful Lubin sought my hand, My heart his suit approved, But, feigning not to understand, I listened still unmoved. For dim, I thought, must burn that flame, Which such a check could smother, And sprightly girls are not to blame To spurn a bashful lover. Poor Lubin told a friend his case, Who soon his fears allayed, And bade him wear a bolder faceâ He listened, and obeyed. Returning soon, with altered mien, He might at once discover, That sprightly girls, of gay sixteen, Ne'er spurn a saucy lover. THE NEEDLE. The gay belles of fashion may boast of excelling In waltz or cotillionâat whist or quadrille; And seek admiration by vauntingly telling, Of drawing, and painting, and musical skill; But give me the fair one, in country or city, Whose home and its duties are dear to her heart, Who cheerfully warbles some rustical ditty, While plying the needle with exquisite art. The bright little needleâthe swift-flying needle, The needle directed by beauty and art. If Love have a potent, a magical token, A talisman, ever resistless and trueâ A charm that is never evaded or broken, A witchery certain the heart to subdueâ 'T is thisâand his armory never has furnished So keen and unerring, or polished a dart; Let Beauty direct it, so pointed and burnished, And oh! it is certain of touching the heart. Be wise then, ye maidens, nor seek admiration By dressing for conquest, and flirting with all; You never, whate'er be your fortune or station, Appear half so lovely at rout or at ball, As gayly convened at a work-covered table, Each cheerfully active and playing her part, Beguiling the task with a song or a fable, And plying the needle with exquisite art. WILLIAM'S GRAVE. The death-bell tolled, and it fell on my ear, Like the knell of departed bliss, As I gazed in despair on William's bier, With eyes that were burning without a tear, To soften a pang like this. For William was all that I valued below, His bosom was honor's shrine, His hand to the needy was prompt to bestow, While he lighted up âsmiles in the aspect of wo,â And kindled new rapture in mine. But death was relentless, and William bowed To a sudden and early doom, No longer the life of the listening crowd, He lowly reclines in a coffin and shroud, And sleeps in the narrow tomb. They made him a bed in the cold, damp ground, Where they laid my love to rest, The sable-clad mourners stood silent around, And sighed in response to the murmuring sound Of the clods, as they fell on his breast. My heart was so full that I could not weep, With spasms I drew my breath, My sobs were so low, and convulsively deep, That I hoped soon to share in my William's sleep, In the chilly embrace of death. From these widowed arms, my love was torn, When hope was revelling bright, And his spirit has passed the eternal bourne, While hapless Maria is left to mourn, Through sorrow's starless night. But morning will dawn, and I shall rise, When life's brittle cord shall sever; In regions far brighter I'll open my eyes, And meet my dear William above the skies, To part no more for ever. THIS LIFE IS NOT THE VALE OF WO. This life is not the vale of wo Which stoics paint in declamation, For countless blossoms round us glow Which breathe the sweetest exhalation. Then let 's enjoy our sunny hours, Nor mourn anticipated gloom, 'T is folly to neglect the flowers, Because they may not always bloom. Let fools for rank and honor seek, I envy not their elevation; Ambition's path is wild and bleak, Content is in an humbler station. May sweet content, dear girl, be thine, Health, friendship, and a faithful lover, And never let the dove repine, Because the eagle soars above her. A TRIO. RONALD. Adieu to love, 'tis glory calls, I go to seek the post of danger, 'Mid clashing blades and whizzing balls, My heart to peaceful thoughts a stranger. LOUISA. May heaven protect thee in the fight, I breathe the wish with pious fervor, ERNEST AND LOUISA. And may its choicest blessings light On thee, our generous, kind preserver. LOUISA. Whate'er thy future fate may be, ERNEST AND LOUISA. Whatever ills beset thee, ALL. Oh, deign sometimes to think of me, Who never can forget thee. THE TOMB OF HENRY. Where Hudson's murmuring billows Kiss Jersey's verdant shore, Beneath those spreading willows Sleeps Henry of the moor. The pride of all the plain Was Anna's chosen swain: But Anna weeps, for Henry sleeps Beneath the weeping-willow tree. They loved with pure affection, Their artless souls were true; The promising connection Their friends with rapture view, And name the morn of May Their happy wedding day. But Anna weeps, for Henry sleeps Beneath the weeping-willow tree. They hail the rising morrow, Which dawns to see them blest; But ah! ere eve, what sorrow Fills Anna's lovely breast! She sees the Hudson's wave Become her Henry's grave; And Anna weeps, for Henry sleeps Beneath the weeping-willow tree. She tears her flowing tresses, Invokes his parted breath, And with her wild caresses Invites him back from death; But ah! her lip's warm kiss Imparts no glow to his! And Anna weeps, for Henry sleeps Beneath the weeping-willow tree. She sees beneath the willow Her lover laid to rest, The earth his nuptial pillow, And not her virgin breast. Around his verdant tomb The early daisies bloom; There Anna weeps, there Henry sleeps Beneath the weeping-willow tree. NO MORE SHALL HOPE'S ILLUSIVE DREAM. No more shall hope's illusive dream, Nor wild ambition's idle scheme, With visions false distract my brain, Of promised good I ne'er obtain. But here in life's sequestered path, I'll smile at fate, nor dread its wrath, And calmly look without a moan, On bliss that might have been my own. YOU HESITATEâOH THEN 'TIS YOU. You hesitateâOh then 'tis you, To whom my grateful thanks are due! Confess it then, for you alone So sensitively feeling, Could nobly act as you have done, The action still concealing. Yes, yesâ't is plainâthe truth I see, Confess the artifice to me. You'll not confess, when I implore! Then never seek to serve me more. I blushed not to accept the boon, So delicately tendered, The favor which you are so soon, Ashamed of having rendered. Yes, yesâ't is plainâthe truth I see, Ashamed of having rendered me. A REQUEST. Though milder skies allure thee hence, And smiling native scenes invite, Where fancy to thy view presents A glowing picture of delight. No flowery vales, nor verdant scenes, So sweet a fragrance can impart, As friendship's tender evergreens, Nourished by memory in the heart. In ours those plants shall ever bloom, Freshened by tear-drops of regret, While one sweet hope will light the gloom, The hope that thou wilt not forget. But should new friends and joys efface, The forms of those thou leav'st behind, Oh let the humble lines I trace, Recall the picture to thy mind. TO A LADY. WRITTEN IN HER ALBUM. Among the flowers of sentiment Which form this bright boquet, The humble tribute I present May claim a placeâfor it is meant My friendship to portray. But be it not, I pray, united With hyacinth or yew, Emblems, alas! of friendship slighted, Of pure affection unrequited, And cold indifference too. But let the offering bloom beside The muse's eglantineâ Between the lalac's purple pride, And one more delicately dyed, The fragrant jessamine. For we, in these, the emblem trace, Of poesy and youth, And that inestimable grace Which guards the heart, and lights the face Of modesty and truth. The constant myrtle may be near, The timid violet too, The amaranth, to virtue dear, And the sweet rose, which all revere, Of thee, an emblem true. But let no cold narcissus bloom, Dear maid, to blight the rest; For, ah! self-love is sure to doom Our virtues to an early tomb, If cherish in the breast. DEDICATION OF AN ALBUM. And is my humble lyre to be The first that wakes a lay, To dedicate a book to thee, Designed for wit and poesy? Dear lady I obey. For like this fair unsullied leaf, Was once thy infant mind; Save when alternate joy and grief Flitted across, with stay so brief, They left no trace behind. But genius, wit, and taste refined, With knowledge, science, art, Saw the bright tablet of thy mind, A spotless blank, and all combined To fill so fair a chart. And long, I trust, this volume will Of thee an emblem prove; While wit and taste its pages fill, Be every precept they instil Such as the virtuous love. ANSWER TO A LADY, WHO SENT HER ALBUM TO THE AUTHOR FOR A CONTRIBUTION. And dost thou then request a lay From one to thee unknown, One, who, without that kindling ray Which bright inspiring eyes convey, Could never wake a tone? Alas! the heartless lines I trace Will have no charm for thee; For if Peru's untutored race, Had never seen their god's bright face, How cold their prayers would be! 'T is true that Fame, in brightest dyes, Her magic pencil dips, To paint the mental charms I prize, Reflected from thy sparkling eyes, Or warbled from thy lips. But ah! however bright we own The portrait all admire, The fair original alone Could waken feeling's purest tone From my neglected lyre. When thou wouldst catch the dewdrops, shook From Fancy's glittering wing, Let thy own hand present the book, And with thy own bewitching look, Inspire the bard to sing. OH WHAT IS VIRTUE? TO A LADY. Oh what is virtue?â't is to keep Each passion under strict control, Nor let a wily tempter creep Into the garden of the soul; It is to conquer selfish pride, And each inordinate desire, To take the Scriptures for our guide, And speak and act as they require. Oh what is virtue;â't is to love Beyond all things in time and space, Him who descended from above, To save from death our rebel race; It is to love the words he spake, Which none on earth e'er spake before, His burden and his yoke to take, And bear them meekly as he bore. Oh what is virtue?â't is to prize Another's interest as our own; In joy or grief to sympathize, For bliss received, or pleasures flown. It is to keep the mind and heart, From every selfish motive free; To walk by Truth's unerring chartâ It is, in short, to be like thee. RONDEAU. Whatever fleeting pleasure, In riches we discover, Oh they 've a double measure, Who share it with a lover. The heart which worships sordid pelf, True bliss can never prove, Its wishes centre all in self, The deadliest foe to love. Whatever fleeting pleasure, &amp;c. A generous act itself repays, One beam of joy impart, And millions of reflected rays Will light the giver's heart. Whatever fleeting pleasure, &amp;c. TO MARY. I fondly thought to call thee mine, But we are doomed to sever; Then may the purest joys be thine, If thou art blest, I'll not repine, Though lost to me for ever. May he who holds thy plighted vow, Screen thee from every sorrow; May smiles of pleasure light thy brow, And joy's gay wreath that decks it now, Be fresher still to-morrow. Whate'er my anguish, be thou blest, With love and truth to guide thee, Approved, adored, beloved, caressed, No pang of sorrow in thy breast, No earthly joy denied thee. AWAY WITH CARE AND SORROW. A DUETT. HE. Away with care and sorrow, Let laughing hopes beguile, For every coming morrow May wear a brighter smile; While Love, in playful measure, With chords that never jar, Awakes the notes of pleasure Along the sweet guitar. SHE. But hopes are quickly blighted, For love is apt to fly; And hearts to-day delighted, To-morrow often sigh: Then seize the fleeting treasure, 'T is like a shooting star, And wakes the notes of pleasure Along the sweet guitar. BOTH. If hope is but a bubble, 'T is still a pleasing toy, And every passing trouble, But gives a zest to joy; When Love, in playful measure, And chords that never jar, Awakes the notes of pleasure Along the sweet guitar. HE. What though a cloud of sadness May flit across the mind, A thousand beams of gladness Are still concealed behind; And Joy, in field of azure, Again shall light his star, And wakes the notes of pleasure Along the sweet guitar. SHE. But should a night of sorrow, When dewy eyes are damp, Before the coming morrow, Extinguish Cupid's lamp; Could aught return the treasure, When peace is fled afar, Or wake the notes of pleasure Along the sweet guitar? BOTH. Though showers of grief should dim it, The torch of love will burn; For tenderness shall trim it, Till smiling Peace return; When Love, in playful measure, With chords that never jar, Shall wake the notes of pleasure, Along the sweet guitar. HE. A beamy smile of gladness, Like that which greets me now, Could chase the clouds of sadness: From every manly brow. It lights the eye of azure, Like Love's delicious star, And wakes the notes of pleasure, Along the sweet guitar. SHE. When Music's notes are sounding, 'T is joy that lights the eye; For hearts are gayly bounding, So sweet the minutes fly; While Hope, in playful measure, With chords that never jar, Awakes the notes of pleasure Along the sweet guitar. BOTH. Then hence with care and sorrow, Let laughing hopes beguile, For every coming morrow, May wear a brighter smile; While Love, in playful measure, With chords that never jar, Awakes the notes of pleasure, Along the sweet guitar. WRITTEN IN MY NIECE'S ALBUM. âDo write in my album, dear uncle!â you said; âAnd what shall the subject be, niece?â You answered, âWhatever may pop in your head, I am sure it will be a good piece.â Alas! how the blossoms of feeling decay! When life's vernal morning was young, If Beauty requested, I warbled a lay, For love was the theme that I sung. But age has extinguished the fire of my heart, And clouded the light of my brain; The joys we are seeking so swiftly depart, We never can taste them again. A TURKISH SONG. The wretch of sordid mould, who poises love with gold, And hugs the yellow store till passion's rage is o'er, Can never hope to prove the sweets of mutual love. But oh, the generous youth, inspired by love and truth, Who deems no price too high, that wins affection's sigh, 'T is he alone can move a maiden's heart to love. A maiden's heart is cold, till touched with dart of gold, All feathered from the dove, and barbed by infant love; Its polished point must be, the weapon of the bee. Adorned and hid from view, by gems of honeydew; It then so charms the eye, we deem no danger nigh, Till deep within the heart is felt the nectared smart. AWAKE, MY DEAR JANE. Through curtains of crimson and azure, my Jane, Infant day, in its cradle, is smiling again; Its eyelids are gemed with the dewdrops of night, Which glitter and sparkle like pearls in the light. Jane! sweet Jane!âAwake, my dear Jane! Oh list to the warblings that float on the air! The gay-feathered songsters are calling my fair! The blackbird and robin, the linnet and jay, All join with thy Sandy to call thee away. Jane! sweet Jane!âAwake, my dear Jane! The lads and the lasses are all on the green, The shepherds have chosen my Jane for their queen. The Maypole is reared, and the garlands are twined, And a balm-breathing wreath is for Jenny designed. Jane! sweet Jane!âAwake, my dear Jane! THE SICILIAN KNIGHT. Gentle zephyrs of morning were stealing 'Mid the dew-spangled leaves of the grove, Where a knight to his lady-love kneeling, Breathed anew his professions of love. While his war-steed impatiently neighing, Chid the gallant young hero's delay, And the loud bugle's clamorous braying, Called the soldier to battle away. Though she listened in silence, her blushes Are confessing an answering flame, And the sparkling tear tenderly gushes, As he whispers of danger and fame. One embraceâa farewellâand 't is over, For his fiery steed bears him afar, And she prays to the saints for her lover, As he hies to the Palestine war. Many months sighed the maid in seclusion, And in dreams saw the chivalrous youth, Plunge the Saracen host in confusion, In supporting the banner of truth. And that banner was guilded with glory, As it gleamed like a comet afar, And the deeds are recorded in story, He achieved at the Palestine war. Yet amid the rough battle's commotion, Would his fancy retreat to the grove, Where he last breathed the vows of devotion, To the fair one who sanctioned his love. But the rude din of war is now over, And her champion returns from afar, While she blesses the day that her lover, Boldly hied to the Palestine war. THE KISS OF LOVE. Yes, e'en in parting there's a pleasure! One balmy, sweet, redeeming treasure, Long cherished in the lover's heart, Else who, alas! could live to part? It is the sweet, confessing tear, It is the tell-tale sigh we hear, It is the kiss of love sincere! Thus lovers, too, in absence, borrow From memory's store a balm for sorrow; While Hope, with smile divinely sweet, Still whispers of an hour to meet, When eyes shall beam with pleasure's tear, While rapture's sigh salutes the ear, Breathed in the kiss of love sincere! HOPE AND MEMORY. Oh cease, busy Fancy, to conjure up pleasures, That flit like bright phantoms o'er memory's glass, And teach us to yearn for the forfeited treasures, Which rise but to mock us, so swiftly they pass; Which fade and dissolve into air, like a dream, Or bubbles that glitter and break on the stream. And yet it is sweet, in our moments of sadness, To gaze on the picture of former delights, Till bounding again to the measure of gladness, The heart has forgotten the sorrow that blights, And revels a moment in joys that are passed, But wakes to a bitterer pang than the last. Yet Hope shall illumine the gloom of our sorrow, The cherub whose smile is a life-giving ray; Whose flattering promise of brightness to-morrow, With ruddiness tinges the clouds of to-day. Though Memory's visions may heighten our pain, Yet Hope's sunny smile can assuage it again. THE HARP THAT I STRUNG. The harp that I strung, when it woke at her touch, How sweet were its chidings for broken repose! The accent was plaintive, my feelings were such, And a sigh would escape at each tremulous close. It warbled like birds in a tropical grove, Of scenes in the beauty of Eden arrayed; It murmured of hope, and it whispered of love, The harp that I strung for the beautiful maid. The fingers of beauty were gracefully flung O'er chords which they often had wakened to song, And I knew by its tones 't was the harp that I strung, So sadly, when struck, it complained of the wrong. And such is the heart, when its slumbers have flown, And anguish or rapture its fibres invade, How much it resembles in feeling and tone The harp that I strung for the beautiful maid. THE HAPPY FAMILY. RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED TO MISS MARY G. T?N, OF HEMPSTEAD, L. I. Hempstead, sweet, âlovely village of the plain,â For thee the Muse would weave a grateful strain; For erst around thy glowing scenes I strayed, When summer's flowery garb thy form arrayed; A stranger and an invalid I came, For fell disease had paralyzed my frame; But here, I met with friends whose hearts could feel For wounded spirits that no art could heal; Cherished by them, I snatched a short repose, In calm forgetfulness of all my woes; And almost felt, beneath one friendly dome, The lost felicities and joys of home. For one blessed mansion, Mary, still presents An Eden of pure love and innocence, The Happy Family,â par excellence. Thy smile still lights itâMary, 't is thy sire's, Thy own paternal roof, which oft inspires Such aspirations as my doubts beguile; âOh, that a home like this for me would smile!â The very wish can chase the cloud of care, And hope half mingles with the minstrel's prayer. TO MISS HARRIET T?N, OF HEMPSTEAD, L. I. My left side suffersâyet I find The heart retains its former station, And warmly throbs, whene'er the mind Reverts to one dear habitation. The mind, too, suffers; for the power Of memory is paralyzed; And only dimly marks the hour Which erst so tenderly I prized. When in that habitation nursed, By Friendship's warm and tender care, I said that fate might do its worstâ Soothed by such friends, I 'd learn to bear! When cheered by Harriet's laughing eyes, I nearly lost the sense of pain; But fettered memory hourly tries To sketch that watching look, in vain. Oh, yes, I know I have a heart, For I can often feel it beat, Just as in youth it used to start, When beauty's glance I chanced to meet. But youth and health, alas! are gone! They were not prized enough when mine, And I were now a wretch forlorn, But for the loves that round me twine. Wife, children, friends!âAll-bounteous Heaven! I humbly thank thee, from my heart, For these blessed joys, which thou hast given, Sweet solace for affliction's smart. Oh, yes, for these I would endure, Were it thy will, another life, As painful as the pastâas poor! But grant me still my present wife. TO MISS MARY JANE Y?G, OF GREENSBURGH, PA. Our earth is but a verdant isle, That floats on the ethereal tide, Basking in Sol's life-giving smile, It can not leave its parent's side; Their tie is loveâalas! the pain Of separation, Mary Jane! And here I sometimes meet a form That I have never seen beforeâ Some shipwrecked sylph, escaped the storm That drove her on our sea-girt shore, While crossing ether's trackless main, From Eden's confines, Mary Jane. I greet her as an angel, strayed From the fair regions of the blessed, And welcome the celestial maid, Entreating her to be my guest. If she consentâalas! the pain Of parting with her, Mary Jane! Thy form is such, and late thy smileâ That smile of witching innocence!â Illumined my dwelling for awhile, Till love and duty called thee hence. My wife, a sister-sylph, in vain Prayed thee to tarry, Mary Jane. It could not be! and thus 't is ever Our fate, from those we love, to sever. But, ah! such pangs are wisely given, Lest we forget to seek for heaven; For there, in realms unknown to pain, We yet shall meet thee, Mary Jane. EPITHALAMIUM. ON THE MARRIAGE OF M. M. MARTIN, ESQ., TO MISS JANE IRWIN. The flame that burns on Hymen's shrine, If fanned by Cupid's fragrant breath, For ever glows a light divine, That brightens at the touch of death. For true connubial love for ever Through kindred hearts incessant rolls, And naught in heaven or earth can sever The cord that joins congenial souls. The nuptial couch is heaven on earth, If truth and purity be there; 'T is not in words to speak its worthâ Angelic harps its bliss declare. There heavenly love with wisdom meets, There fond affection joins with truth, To revel in ambrosial sweets, An Eden of immortal youth. Thrice happy pair! may fadeless verdure The Martin's favorite Marsh adorn; Thrice happy pair! for angels heard your Pledge upon the nuptial morn. Be happy still, till joys supernal, Immortal in your bosoms rise, For Hymen's sweets will bloom eternal, To bless your loves beyond the skies. LOVES SHE LIKE ME? Oh say, my fluttering heart, Loves she like me? Is her's thy counterpartâ Throbs it like thee? Does she remember yet, The spot where first we met, Which I shall ne'er forget? Loves she like me? Soft echoes still repeat, âLoves she like me?â When on that mossy seat, Beneath the tree, I wake my amorous lay, While lambkins round me play, And whispering zephyrs say, Loves she like me? On her I think by day, Loves she like me? With her in dreams I stray, O'er mead or lea. My hopes of earthly bliss Are all comprised in this, To share her nuptial kiss? Loves she like me? Does absence give her pain? Loves she like me? And does she thus arraign Fortune's decree? Does she my name repeat? Will she with rapture greet The hour that sees us meet? Loves she like me? I SIGH NOT FOR GLORY. I sigh not for glory to dazzle the crowd, I ask not for fortune to strut with the proud, I covet no title of any degree, Except, my dear Rosa, a title to thee. But yet if the fates have unkindly ordained, That these must be mine ere thy hand is obtained, Inspired by the smiling young hopes which I cherish, I'll ask them, and win them, dear Rosa, or perish. TO A LADY, ON PARTING WITH A COPY OF THE âDEWDROPS.â Adieu, gentle fair! and till fate shall decree Again to restore thee to friendship and me, Accept of this token of brotherly love, The âDewdropsâ of mercy distilled from above. And when the sad period of absence is past, And those thou art leaving embrace thee at last, No tears of regret shall their rapture annoy, But Dewdrops shall sparkle in sunbeams of joy. LADY, ACCEPT THIS LITTLE BOOK. Lady, accept this little book, A trifling token of regard, And when upon these lines you look, Bestow one thought upon the bard. 'T is friendship prompts the humble lay, From flattery's heartless fictions free, Which only simply means to say, He dedicates the book to thee. The morn of life is fair and bright, And childhood's path is strewed with flowers, While fragrant gems of sparkling light, Are scattered from the light-winged hours. Youth revels in the Eden scene, Diversified with hills and slope, And strays among the arbors green, Led by the hand of smiling hope. But disappointment's chilling blast, On passion's wave destructive beat, Ere mid-day comes, too often cast, The blighted beauties at our feet. Yet, still, dear girl, whate'er betide, Though flowers may fade as soon as blown, Let virtue be thy constant guide, And happiness thy own. YES, LOVE HAS ITS SORROWS. Yes, love has its sorrows, but who would refuse 'em, So mingled with rapture and joy? What mortal the rose would discard from his bosom, For fear that it's thorns might annoy? THE LOCK OF HAIR. Yes, it is mineâthat ringlet token, That raven lock of glossy shine, What transport has the pledge awoken, In this enraptured heart of mine; And next my heart the gift I'll wear, That heart with pure affection swelling, And thus a lock of angel's hair, Will then be near an angel's dwelling. Oh tell me not that hopes delusive, Or joys unreal my fancy mock, When doubts require a proof conclusive, I'll look upon this raven lock. Or if it all illusion be, My heart with joy is so elated, I'd hug it still in ecstacy, Nor wish the error dissipated. MY CARD-RACK. TO THE FAIR ARTIST IN SHELLWORK, WHO MADE THEM FOR FAIRS. Oh! Fancy's pencil never traced, Nor Art's inventive powers designed, Such beauty, genius, wit, and taste, In one sweet portraiture combined. When at the fair you charmed our eyes, Each candid heart acknowledged there, That justice must award the prize To you, the fairest of the fair. That hour is pastâbut memory oft, Pictures the glowing scene anew, That speaking glance, so bright and soft, And all the charms that circled you. But when I gaze on those dear shells, Which nought on earth could purchase back, With hope and fear my bosom swells, For doubts still keep me on the rack. But I will hope, and persevere, Dangers and obstacles despise, As sportmen, who pursue the deer, Hazard existence for the prize. But had I one sharp-pointed dart, With Cupid's skill and Cupid's bow, I 'd pierce one little bounding hart, And mine should be the timid Roe. LOVE. Love, gentle fair, can boast a source divine, Whatever be its earthly form and feature, It flows like Sol's life-giving beams benign, From the Creator to the humblest creature. It is the very life and soul, Of all that live, and breathe, and move; There 's not a pulse from pole to pole But vibrates solely from the power of love. The largest form, the smallest thing, That Nature's boundless kingdom holds, Whether it move by feet or wing, Or finny oar, or sinuous folds; All, all exist on this mysterious plan, From viewless insects up to lordly man. Love, in its essence, ever flows the same, But when recipient vessels are defiled, They change its nature, purity, and aim, To earthly passions, selfish, fierce, and wild; To envy, malice, covetous desire, Revenge, ambition, pride, and jealous ire, Till Love's benignant, pure, celestial flame, Is thus converted to infernal fire! Not so, in hearts like thine, my fair, Guarded by knowledge, truth, and reason, For vice can find no entrance there, By open force, or subtle treason. Such hearts, like mirrors, catch the rays Of Love's benignant flame, Reflecting back a milder blaze, Of humble gratitude and praise, To bless the giver's name. They throw around inspiring gleams Of bliss that angels taste above, And these are but reflected beams From the pure flame of love. But if a true, congenial heart, Of firmer texture, catch its light, Into one focal point will dart The rays of both, and there unite. Resign the lens to Cupid's care, While Hymen's torch shall blaze above: Such be thy happy lot, my fair, For this will be connubial love. THE WHITE COTTAGE. Thou peaceful cot beneath whose roof The calmest, purest joys are mine; Where sweetest smiles, affection's proof, Their sunny rays, for my behoof, With mildest, purest, lustre shine. No pilgrim of the stormy main, Enters his haven with such joy As fills my bosom, when I gain Thy evening shelter, and obtain The kiss of welcome from my boy. Thy snow-white wallsâthe lattice green, Which veils each modest eye of thine; The trees which throw their shade between, On which the ripening fruit is seen, The gay, rose melons, and the vineâ Allâall delight meâbut the door Admits me to a heaven within; No fretted ceiling, fitted floor, Nor gorgeous trappingsâbut there 's more Of real bliss than monarchs win. Connubial joys and filial love Await my evening welcome homeâ Delights the virtuous prize above The brightest chaplets ever wove For demigods of Greece or Rome. This is my empireâhere enthroned, I envy not the proudest king; My sceptre ne'er can be disowned, For hearts of love, the sweetest toned, To me their joyful anthems sing. Yes, dear loved cottage, while beneath Thy humble roof true bliss is mine, The votive chaplet I will wreath, And here my grateful numbers breathe, To thank the Giver's hand divine. The charms of palace, tower, or dome, With guilded pomp, I covet not; Thou, dear âWhite Cottage,â art my home, From hence I never wish to roam; Content can gild the humblest lot. AUTUMNAL REFLECTIONS. The season of flowers is fled, The pride of the garden decayed, The sweets of the meadow are dead, And the blushing parterre disarrayed. The blossom-decked garb of sweet May, Enamelled with hues of delight, Is exchanged for a mantle less gay, And spangled with colors less bright. For sober Pomona has won The frolicsome Flora's domains, And the work the gay goddess begun, The height of maturity gains. But though less delightful to view, The charms of ripe Autumn appear, Than Spring's richly varied hue, That infantile age of the year. Yet now, and now only, we prove The uses by Nature designed; The seasons were sanctioned to move, To please less than profit mankind. Regret the lost beauties of May, But the fruits of those beauties enjoy; The blushes that dawn with the day, Noon's splendor will ever destroy. How pleasing, how lovely appears Sweet infancy, sportive and gay; Its prattle, its smiles, and its tears, Like spring, or the dawning of day! But manhood's the season designed For wisdom, for works, and for use; To ripen the fruits of the mind, Which the seeds sown in childhood produce. Then infancy's pleasures regret, But the fruits of those pleasures enjoy; Does spring autumn's bounty beget? Lo the Man is begun in the Boy. MARY'S GRAVE. Let those whose hearts have learned to glow With love that ne'er can change or vary, Permit one pitying tear to flow O'er the cold grave of hapless Mary. She loved, alas! a treacherous youth, Who feigned to love the artless fairy; Too late she proved him void of truth, And death relieved the hapless Mary. No more she shines the queen of May, Nor graces more the rustic dairy, For ah! the spoiler bore away The rifled sweets of hapless Mary. Oh then, ye artless nymphs, beware! In trusting faithless man, be wary, And thus escape the fiend Despair, That dug the grave of hapless Mary. THE ORPHAN MAID. How hard the maiden orphan's fate, Whose early joys and hopes are fled, Who vainly asks the rich and great For leave to earn her daily bread! Exposed to frowns, rebukes, and sneers, In humble menial garb arrayed, While heartless fools deride her tears, And spurn the hapless orphan maid. There was a timeâalas! 't is fledâ When fortune, friends, and kindred smiled, When sunny rays of joy were shed Around the gay and happy child; When, shielded by parental care, No pang of sorrow dared invade, Save when she saw the meek despair Of some poor hapless orphan maid. But ah! her parents died, and left Their darling, unprotected child, Of fortune, friends, and joy bereft, And then the maiden never smiled. She only asked to toil for bread, She sought no unrequited aidâ But asked in vain!âtill hope was fled, And death relieved the orphan maid! TO MARY ANN. Dear Mary Ann, the sparkling gems, Which deck the brow of even, Are rayless, to the diadems And jewels on the garment hems Of sainted maids in heaven. The fleecy snow, so pure and white, By winds of winter driven, Is darker than the shades of night, To those celestial robes of light Which clothe the nymphs of heaven. No banquet e'er by mortal spread, No feast by monarch given, Can match the living wine and bread, With which the virgin train are fed, Who crowd the courts of heaven. The crown, the robe, the feast be thine; To all who ask, they 're given; The jewels, gems, the bread and wine, Will fill thee with that flame divine, Which lights the maids of heaven. Thine be the pearl of nameless worth, By Christ alone 't is givenâ And though we never meet on earth, If we obtain the second birth, Thou'lt kiss the bard in heaven. THE BOOK OF THE HEART. WRITTEN IN A YOUNG LADY'S ALBUM. Thy MIND is an ALBUM, unsullied and bright, Just openedâfor angels and spirits to write Each thought and affection, intent and desire, That wisdom may sanctionâthat love may inspire. The book is immortalâOh guard it with care, Lest demons should sully its pages so fair; Repulse such intruders, nor shrink from the strife, And Jesus will smile on the âBook of thy life.â FOR VIOLA'S ALBUM. Yes, I would add one humble leaf, To the bright chaplet thou art twining, But ah! its verdure will be brief, For time is such an errant thief, He blights the sweetest buds with grief, And leaves the fairest flower declining. But there 's a wreath, that ne'er can fade, Already for thy temples twined, Such as in heaven the angels braid, To deck the brows of every maid, Who, like Viola, here displayed The beauties of a cultured mind. That wreath shall deck Viola's brow, In realms unknown to time or grief, And each young plant she cultures now, Each infant mind her toils endow, Will breathe to heaven a fragrant vow, Brightening the tints of every leaf. DUETT. SHE. When grief the heart benumbs, How the pulses languish! HE. Hope, like a cherub, comes, Then we lose the anguish. SHE. Here, late, were clouds of gloom, All the scene surrounding; HE. Now all is dressed in bloom, Hearts are gayly bounding. BOTH. Still, then, in pleasure's bower, Let us rove delighted; Joy is a transient flower, Taste it ere 't is blighted. SHE. Should dark despair return On the coming morrow, HE. Love's torch will brighter burn 'Mid the gloom of sorrow. SHE. Love may himself decamp, In the hour of sadness; HE. Then feed the urchin's lamp With the oil of gladness. BOTH. Thus, here, in pleasure's bower, Let us rove delighted; Joy is a transient flower, Taste it, ere 't is blighted. TO ELIZA. And wilt thou think of him who traced This tributary lay, Or will his image be effaced, As foot-prints in the dew are chased By the next solar ray? Can memory's light become so dim, That thou wilt not remember him? I will not libel thus a heart, Where every grace resides, Where modest nature, void of art, Directed still by virtue's chart, In peerless state presides: She shall thy silent prompter be, Sometimes, dear girl, to think of me. TO A YOUNG LADY. Could any charm have broke the spell, That long has chained my humble lyre, Thy smile had waked the silent shell, And taught its sweetest notes to swell With pure poetic fire. But, oh! its chords are sleeping still, And e'en thy charms must plead in vain; This heart has lost its wonted thrill, Intruding cares its fervors chill, And check its votive strain. THE SILENT CONFESSION. TO A LADY, WHO ASKED THE AUTHOR IF HE COULD INTERPRET A BLUSH THAT HE HAD NOTED. Oh yes, 'twas a fervor of feeling, That gushed like a stream from the heart, And flew through the pulses, revealing What language could never impart. It gave to that frame an emotion, Which sweetly the feeling confessed; A zephyr might breathe on the ocean, And wake such a swell on its breast. The glow of thy visage expressed it, 'T was borne to my heart in a sigh; An eloquent silence confessed it, It spoke in the glance of thine eye. In short, 't was the soul of my treasure, Aroused in alarm from its sleep, That flew to those windows of azure, And lifted their curtains to peep. OH SAY, CAN THIS BE LOVE? Why does my heart so strangely start, Each pulse so wildly play? Why can not willing lips impart What feeling bids them say;â Cease, busy heart!âCan this be love? Why do n't the trembler rest? Why does it throb as if a dove Were caged within my breast? 'T is not the throb of anguishâ It can not fatal proveâ And yet I sigh and languish! Oh say, can this be love? Cease, busy heart!âWhy throbs it so, With such an anxious thrill? It seems to have a fever's glow, And yet I am not ill! Warm on my cheek I feel the flame, Its light illumes my eye; Still, if my lips attempt the name, 'T is whispered in a sigh. 'T is not the sigh of anguishâ So that can nothing prove, And yet I daily languishâ Oh say, can this be love? KATHLEEN O'MOORE. She hung on my bosom, and vowed to be true, As I kissed off a tear-drop, and murmured adieu; Then, slow and sad-hearted, From Kathleen I parted, From Kathleen O'Moore. I tore myself from her, and left her in tears, With a pang at my heart yet remembered for years, Though hope was repeating A promise of meeting With Kathleen O'Moore. 'Twas eve, and the moon brightly smiled on the spot, As I lingered, to gaze yet again on the cot That held the dear treasure I loved without measure, My Kathleen O'Moore. And hope fondly whispered, with flattering tone, That I shortly might call the dear treasure my own; But hope has deceived me, For fate has bereaved me Of Kathleen O'Moore. A richer swain wooed, and she smiled on his plea, And she gave him the hand she had plighted to me, And left me to languish, With heart-rending anguish, For Kathleen O'Moore. TO A?. When that soft, beaming eye reviews This grateful tribute of the Muse, Those coral lips must not refuse One little word to frame; And be the little word they choose, The Poet's name. Oh breathe but that, in one soft sigh, Whene'er these couplets meet thine eye, And Zephyr, as he flutters by, Shall bear the sigh to me, And whisper in thine ear, that I Remember thee. TO IANTHE. Ianthe, could I touch the lyre, With magic art like thine, I 'd wake the spirit-breathing wire To thoughts of light and tones of fire, Like those which, breathed by thee, inspire This raptured heart of mine. And I would still the lay prolong, And oft the strain repeat, To tell how much I love thy song, Its numbers are so sweet. I 've marked theeâere a dozen springs Had bloomed upon thy cheek, When, buoyant on her glittering wings, Thy infant fancy warbled things Such delicate imaginings, As poesy can speak. 'T was genius, uncontrolled by art, And reckless of defeat, I heard the lay, it touched my heart, 'T was wild and simply sweet. I marked the next, with cultured mind, In all the charms of youth, And knew thy lovely form enshrined A heart which every grace combined, By native taste and art refined, The pure abode of truth. Then, when I listened to thy lay, Each pulse with rapture beat, It seemed to bear the soul away, 'T was exquisitely sweet. Another heardâthe one alone Whose worth inspired the strain; Whose manly heart is honor's throne, Who breathed a sigh for every tone, And made his modest wishes known, Nor did he plead in vain. And when a wifeâI heard thee still The matchless strain repeat; How must his heart with transport thrill!â 'T was ravishingly sweet. And is there yet a tenderer tie To twine Ianthe's heart? Can warmer feelings light her eye, And bid her pulses quicker fly? Can any other's smile or sigh Such ecstasies impart? There canâan infant's smile inspire A strain with joy replete; A mother's love attunes the lyreâ 'T is now divinely sweet! SMILE OF AFFECTION. Is there a light whose effulgence can dry The tear of affliction, and rapture restore? 'T is the bright, sunny ray of a love-beam eye, The smile of affection from one I adore. I 'd sigh not for grandeur, for fame, or for wealth, But, thankful for little, would wish for no more, If blest with a cottage, with friendship, and health, And the smile of affection from one I adore. THE ADIEU. Oh, green was the poplar, when, under its shade, I exchanged the soft vow with my shepherdess maid; But winter soon blighted its sweet summer hue, So faded hope when I bade Lilla adieu. Be constant, I sighed, till thy Damon return, For still this fond bosom for Lilla will burn; My heart, like the compass, to love shall be true, She wept, as I murmuredâdear Lilla, adieu! But doomed was my Lilla another to bless, And doomed is her Damon to pine in distress; Like leaves of the poplar, which tempests then strew, My hopes were all scatteredâso, Lilla, adieu! The spring soon returned, and the poplar was drest, But peace had for ever forsaken my breast; From the music of nature no comfort I drew, For the birds and the streams murmured, Lilla, adieu! When, torn by my sorrows, I bow to my doom, Will a tear from my Lilla e'er fall on my tomb? When the leaves on the poplar are blast and few, They'll sigh in the breeze, dearest Lilla, adieu! RELIGIOUS AND ELEGIAC. THE NATIVITY. Strike the loud anthem, to hail the blest morning, Jesus the Saviour an infant appears; Lo! in the East, a new day-spring is dawning! Hark! the glad tidings which sound in our ears! On this auspicious morn, To us a child is born, Glory to God in the highest be given; Hail our Redeemer's birthâ Good will and peace on earthâ Man shall again have conjunction with Heaven. Hark! 't was the voice of a seraph that soundedâ Shepherds of Judea start with surprise, While, with a radiance of glory surrounded, Troops of bright angels descend from the skies. Now loud the choral strain Swells round the happy plain, Glory to God in the highest be given; Hail our Redeemer's birthâ Good will and peace on earthâ Man shall again have conjunction with Heaven. Hail to the Saviour, descending from heaven, To build him a kingdom which never shall cease; The Child that is born and the Son that is given, Is God everlasting, the great Prince of Peace. Praise him with grateful lays, Pour forth the soul in praise; The government rests on his shoulders alone: In him the Godhead dwells Which has subdued the hells; And God the Creator as Jesus is known. THE INCARNATION. Oh for a Seraph's golden lyre, With chords of light, and tones of fire, To sing that wondrous love Which brought a Deity below, To save an erring race from wo, And give them joys above. Oh may that love inspire my soul, Till such ecstatic numbers roll, As are by angels given; To tell Redemption's wondrous plan, How Heaven descended down to man, That man might rise to heaven. His creatures fellâno pitying eye, No powerful arm to save, was nigh, Or aid our feeble powers; He sawâhe cameâhe fought alone, And conquered evils not his own, That we might conquer ours. Temptation's thorny path he trod, In form, a manâin soul, a God, And trod the path alone; In vain the direst fiends assailed, His mighty arm of power prevailed, And hell was overthrown. He passed the dismal vale of deathâ The human form resigned its breath, And like a mortal died; But death was crushed beneath his feet, He rose a God and Man complete, His human glorified. Amazing mercy!âlove immense! Surpassing every human sense, Since time and sense began! That man might shun the realms of pain, And know and love his God again, His God became a man! REDEMPTION. Redemption claims our highest lays, To Jesus Christ belongs the praise; The lofty theme should fire the soul, And music's richest numbers roll. Our blest Redeemer is the God we own, Then swell the chorus to his name alone. Unseen, unknown, and unrevealed, No creature's eye our God beheld, Till he the wondrous work begun, And showed the Father in the Son; Jehovah now as Jesus Christ is known, Then swell the chorus to his name alone. From heaven his pitying eye surveyed The ruin sin on earth had made; He saw his creatures run the road Which led from happiness and God; He saw, and savedâthe work was all his own, Then swell the chorus to his name alone. Swift from supernal realms of day, Seraphic minstrels winged their way, To hail the great Redeemer's birth, And published peace to men on earth: âTo God give gloryââsung the joyous throng, Let men and angels still repeat the song. Alas! no human accents can Express the love of God to man; Who, to redeem a sinful worm, Assumed the human mind and form; Was born a man, that man might be re-born! Then let us praise him on his natal morn. GOD IN HIS TEMPLE. God is in his holy temple, Sons of earth be silent now; Hither let the saints assemble, And before his footstool bow. Lo, he 's present with us ever, When assembled in his name; Aiding every good endeavor, Guiding every humble aim. God is in his holy temple, 'T is each renovated mind; Where the purer thoughts assemble, While the base are cast behind. Every earthly, low affection, Long opposed, is silent now; Every passion, in subjection, Must at Wisdom's altar bow. God is in his holy temple, 'T is the church he calls his own, 'T is the city where assemble All who worship him alone. New Jerusalem the holy Is the city of our God, There our Saviour governs solely, With the balance and the rod. God is in his holy temple, 'T is the body of our Lord; Infidels may doubt and tremble, We have learned it from his Word; From the Word which wrought creation, From that Word which flesh became, Which alone can give salvationâ God and Jesus are the same. THE WORLD OF MIND. FIRST DAY OF CREATION. There is a worldâthe world of mind, By neither time nor space confined; And when we cease in flesh to dwell, That world will be our heaven or hell. By fallen nature, 't is, alas! A rude, chaotic, shapeless mass; Devoid of goodness, truth, or light, And veiled in backest shades of night. But he who gave creation birth, Can re-create this mental earth; For this his Spirit, like a dove, Broods o'er our secret thoughts in love. If we consent to be renewed, And wish our evil lust subdued; âLet there be light,â he says, and straight We see our low, disordered state. Then do we seek to know the Lord, Receive instruction from his word; While he divides the day from night, And we proceed from shade to light. Lord, let thy Spirit, like a dove, Brood over all our souls in love; Then give us light our state to see, And we will give the praise to thee. THE WORLD OF MIND. SECOND DAY OF CREATION. Our God can re-create, And form the soul anew; And all who will co-operate, Shall find his promise true. When we permit his light Our evils to reprove, And then those evils boldly fight, He will the whole remove. Though hard the contest prove, And doubtful seem the fray, He hovers o'er us with his love, Till we have gained the day. The Lord will then create A firmament sublime, Celestial thoughts to separate From those of sense and time. We then no more believe The work to be our own; But all of good that we receive Ascribe to God alone. Thus will a second birth Form heaven within the soul, And man, a new-created earth, In order's orbit roll. MIRIAM'S SONG. Sing to Jehovah an anthem of praise, And tell of his glory in rapturous lays; Sing of his triumphs when demons assaulted, When hosts of infernals his human assailed, The hells were subdued, and the Victor exaltedâ Like man he was temptedâlike God he prevailed. Sing to Jehovah an anthem of praise, And tell of his triumphs in rapturous lays. Praise him, ye ransomedâhe conquered for you, Who fled from your sins, and beheld them pursue, Whelming your spirits in deep tribulation; But Jesus was present, a pillar of fire, And led you in safety through seas of temptation, In which you beheld each assailant expire. Sing to Jehovah an anthem of praise, And tell of his triumphs in rapturous lays. Praise him who conquered our spiritual foes, When fierce, like an army of horsemen, they rose, Threatening again in their shackles to bind us; Through billows of trouble he led us to shore, While the horse and his rider were foundered behind us, O'erwhelmed in the gulf, to assail us no more. Sing to Jehovah an anthem of praise, And tell of his triumphs in rapturous lays. OPEN THE DOOR. That God who calls the human mind, A temple for himself designed, A house upon a rockâ Assures us he will patient wait, In mercy, at the mental gate, And for admittance knock. Who hears the gracious call within, And draws the iron bolts of sin, Which barricade the door, Will banquet with a guest divine, On life-imparting food and wine, From Love's exhaustless store. Come, then, dear Saviourâbe my guest, Knock louder at this flinty breast, And rouse me with thy voice; Then will I struggle to remove The sins which now obstruct thy love, And in that love rejoice. Thou wilt not let me strive in vainâ The gates of brass shall burst in twain, The iron bars shall fall; Then will my soul thy temple be, Where I shall ever feast with thee, My God, my life, my all! HOW SHALL I COME BEFORE HIM? How shall we sinners come before Our blessed Saviour's dazzling throne; Or how acceptably adore The great redeeming God we own? Shall fatlings on his altar burn, Or oil in bounteous rivers flow? Will God be pleased with such return, For all the mighty debt we owe? Or shall we burst the tenderest tie That binds the throbbing seat of sense, And with our body's offspring buy A pardon for our soul's offence? Ah! noâa humble, contrite heart, Is all the offering God requires; Our only sacrifice, to part With evil loves and false desires. Oh let us, then, no longer stray, Along the dangerous paths we 've trod; For he has plainly showed the way Which will conduct us back to God. 'T is but to regulate the mind By the pure precepts of his word; To act with truth and love combined, And humbly imitate the Lord. HAPPINESS. Who then is happy? Ere she close the strain, The muse herself shall answer. 'T is the man (Of easy fortune and a generous heart) Whose charity by wisdom is directed; Who loves his God, his neighbor, and himself, In just descending order; whose employ Is doing good to others; whose reward, The bright reflection of the joy he gives. Like a mild taper in a diamond lustre, Which multiplies one little ray to thousands, His means of blessing still increase by use. Not all the evils of this sordid world, Can shake the solid peace of such a man. The changing seasons, times, events, and all The various scenes that checker human life, And e'en the chilling adverse storms of fate, Serve but to ripen the celestial fruits His active love produces; draughts of bliss He quaffs for every little taste he gives, And finds a heaven in wishing others there. To seek for happiness in things of sense, In wealth, ambition, pleasure, or supineness, Is but a vain exertionâidle hope; For then we chase a transitory cheat, And leave the game, the real prize, behind, Hid in contentment's calm sequestered vale, While we toil up the mountain's rugged side, Tempting new dangers, and exposed to all The storms that beat ambition's bleaker road; Or perils worse than these, concealed beneath The treacherous sweets that bloom in pleasure's path, A thousand serpent-stings, unseen, but fatal. And if in dastard indolence we rest, Our lazy hopes are certain of defeat. Then learn the true, the only real source Whence happiness can flowâa precept drawn From holy writ this heavenly source proclaimsâ âTo fear the Lord, and his commands obeys, Is man's whole duty,â in a single line; An easy yoke, a burden light to bear. 'T is but to love in heart and action bothâ For love is the fulfilling of the law. CONSECRATION. Jesus is God, and God alone, Oh, be this TRUTH confest, For 't is the sure foundation stone On which the church shall rest. Though modern builders pass it by, And scribes and priests reject, On this blest TRUTH, which they deny, We now the church erect. Though earth and hell against it join, Yet must this building rise; The work, Almighty God, is thine, And wondrous in our eyes SIN NO MORE. A song of gratitude begin, To praise the God who saves from sin; Who marks the penitential tear, And deigns the contrite sigh to hear; Who whispers hope, when we our sins deploreâ âThy God condemns thee notâoffend no more.â But ah! such love can ne'er be sungâ Such boundless grace!âby mortal tongue; For e'en celestial minstrels deem Their highest skill below the theme; Yet mortals can, with gratitude, adore The God who pardons all that sin no more. Dear Lord! is this condition allâ To fight the foes that wrought our fall? Thus armed with hope, I'll quell a host, Nor let so cheap a heaven be lost; Oh then repeat the sweet assurance o'er, âThy God will not condemn theeâsin no more.â AND DID I SAY? And did I say my lyre should sleep, Because no laurels decked it; That I no more its chords would sweep, Because its lay is valued cheap, And all the world neglect it? I didâbut felt not then the flame Which now within me blazes, Nor recked of His eternal claim, Who gave the lyre to sing his name, And utter forth his praises. But now that lyre shall sleep no more, Nor wake to earthly measures; But every strain it warbles o'er, Shall that Eternal Source adore, Whence flow immortal pleasures. No more I prostitute its lay, To subjects evanescent; But sing those scenes of endless day, Where angel harps in rapture play, And praises flow incessant. THE PARALYTIC'S DEPRECATION. Paralysis, thou ruthless fiend, forbear! Drag not thy victim thus to fell despair! Or art thou licensed by offended Heaven? And has commission, then, to thee been given, Around poor, erring mortals thus to throw Thy iron shackles? Demon, let me go! Why chain me thus? dissolve the spell! relent! In vain I struggle, for my strength is spent. In pity spare me! for I can not move My limbs, nor lift my pinioned arms above, In supplication to the throne of grace; Hold, ruthless demon! for a little space. Father of mercies! humbled to the dust, I here confess the visitation just; For I have sinned against thy truth and grace, And thus before thee lowly bend my face; Confusion seals my lips, and ties my tongue, But oh! remember what thy prophet sung: That âthou art merciful and graciousâ still, To all who bow submissive to thy will; Still âslow to anger,â merciful as just, Oh give me hope! remember I am dust; Thou wilt not always chide, nor anger bear To crush a wretch that pleads with thee in prayer; For, like the royal bard, by truth convicted, I feel â't is good for me to be afflicted, That I might learn thy statutesâ and thy law, Whence all my consolations now I draw. For ere affliction's cloud obscured my day, How oft temptations lured my steps astray! But now I keep thy word with zealous fear, Oh, with thy pard'ning mercy still be near, According to thy loving-kindness, Lord, As thou hast promised sinners in thy word; Oh blot out my transgressions; wash my soul, From its pollutionsâmake the leper whole. Hear my petition! make me to know, once more, The âjoy and gladnessâ which I knew before; So shall my âbroken bones again rejoice,â And I will praise thee with a grateful voice! BE WISE! The graver moralist resumes his theme, To wake the soul from error's fatal dream; To show the path which leads to solid bliss, The happy goal which slaves of passion miss. PHILOSOPHY AND RELIGION. There is a Philosophy, hollow, unsound, To matter confining its false speculations; Whose flight is restrained within Nature's dull round, Its pinions the web of sophistic persuasions. And there 's a Philosophy truly divine, That traces effects up to spiritual causes, Determines the link of the chain where they join, And soars to an infinite height ere it pauses. That meanly debases the image of God, To rank with the brutes in the scale of creation; This raises the tenant of light from the sod, And bears him to heaven, his primitive station. Hail, science of Angels! Theosophy, hail! That shows us the regions of bliss by reflection; Removes from creation's broad mirror the vail, Where spirit and matter appear in connection. Its breaks on the soul in an ocean of light, She starts from her lethargy stretches her pinions, Beholds a new world bursting forth on her sight, And, soaring in ecstacy, claims her dominions. A sense of original, dignified worth, Her bosom expands with sublime exultation; She tastes immortality even on earth, In light that eclipses the sun's emanation. Be sages and pedants to nature confined, As the bat darkly flutters in Luna's pale presence; I'll soar, like the eagle, through regions of mind, In the blaze of that Sun which is truth in its essence. WEEPING MARY. IMITATED FROM THE LATIN, IN THE CATHOLIC PRAYER-BOOK. Weeping Mary, bathed in sorrow, Lingered near the scene of horror, Where the dying Saviour hung; From whose bursting heart arising, Groans of anguish agonizing, Floated e'er his fevered tongue! Oh what sorrow, deep, unbounded, That maternal bosom wounded, Once the Saviour's couch of rest! How she wept to see him languish, How she trembled for the anguish Laboring in his guiltless breast! Who could witness, without weeping, Gushing streams of sorrow sweeping Down the mother's pallid cheek? Who, with bosom unrelenting, Could behold her thus lamenting, Looking what no tongue could speak? While such pangs as fiends invented, Still her suffering Son tormented, Scorn and bruises, stripes and death; She beheld him thus expiring, Human friends in fear retiring, Whilst in groans he spent his breath! Matchless mercy! love amazing! Far above our feeble praising, Far beyond our humble lays; May its influence never vary, Till my heart, like that of Mary, Glow with a seraphic blaze. Gracious Saviour, now in glory! Be this sad, affecting story Deeply on thy soul imprest! May the scene of such affliction, Bring the hardest heart conviction, Melt the most obdurate breast! NEW JERUSALEM. Rich in mercy, Jesus reigns, Heaven owns no other king; Crown him, mortals, in your strains, While his matchless grace you sing. Angels wake their loftier lays, Kindled from celestial fires, Humbler spirits bid his praise Sweetly flow from silver lyres. Mortals! catch the pleasing strain, Gratitude demands the songâ Jesus builds his church again, Where your Babel stood so long. Truth divine her wall supports, Love has paved her street with gold; See her jasper towers and courts, Gates of pearl that never fold. Pilgrims! enter and rejoiceâ Here your Saviour holds his throne; 'T is the City of his choice, 'T is the Church he calls his own. Precious gems, on every side, Lend new lustre to her charmsâ 'T is the Lamb's celestial Bride, Smiling in her husband's arms. REGENERATION. âBlessed is the man who walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,â &amp;c.â Psalm i., 1, 2, 3. How happy the man who discards from his breast The lusts and the passions which daily molest; Who heeds not their counsel or softest persuasion, But treats them as foes upon every occasion. Though the sunshine of peace such a bosom illume, Or nights of temptation involve it in gloom; Whatever his state be, with calm resignation, He looks to the Word of his God for salvation. And the Word of his God, like a river of truth, Gives each young-budding virtue the vigor of youth; While practical love is still tempered by reason, As the green leaflet decks the ripe fruit in its season. Thus regeneration proceeds from the Word, If we combat our evils, and trust in the Lord; Then prosper, dear Saviour, each humble endeavor, And thine be the glory, for ever and ever! BRIGHT IS THE WORD. Bright is the Word, 'tis light divine, A Sun that will for ever shine, To light us o'er the pathless sand, From Egypt to the promised land. Then swell the anthem to its Author's praise, Who through the world extends its cheering rays. Clear is the Word, whose living stream, Reflecting love's celestial beam, Through every sterile desert rolls, Imparting life to dying souls; The tree of life adorns its verdant brink, It flows to allâand all may freely drink. Then let the grateful anthem rise To God, the only good and wise, Who bids the heathen hear his voice, And in his boundless love rejoice. The light shall spread, the bounteous river flow, Till all the earth a Saviour's love shall know. ON THE CONSECRATION OF A CHURCH. Awake the organ's pealing tone, And bid the grateful anthem swell, To make Jehovah's goodness known, And of his wondrous mercies tell. Creator, Father, Saviour, Lord! To raise from hell our fallen race He gave himselfâhe gave his Word, And gives us still his quick'ning grace. Here, when the seed of truth was cast, His saw the tender, trembling shoot, And screened it from the wintry blastâ The vine is his, and his the fruit. 'T was warmed by Love's celestial ray; While lucid truths, like heavenly dew, With liquid pearls begemmed the spray, And like an Eden plant it grew. This dawning year beholds it grown A little vineyard. Lord, to thee We yield the fruitsâthey are thine own: The planter, thouâthe laborers, we. This vineyard now in orders stands, Thy laws of order are divine! Accept this tribute at our handsâ Almighty God, the work was thine. SEEK YE THE LORD. Ye sons of men, come, seek the Lord, While yet he may be found; II'll meet you in his holy Word, Where love and truth abound. Call on him while he yet is near To hear a sinner's call; A humble penitential tear Will never vainly fall. Let man forsake the sinner's road, Discard each vicious thought, Return to Jesus, as his God, And be by Jesus taught; Then will the Lord his mercy show, His pardon freely give; Then man his only good will know, And in that knowledge live. âFATHER, THOU ART GOOD!â âIf ye, then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your father which is in heaven, give good things to them that ask him!ââ Matt. vii., 11. My youngest boy, just five years old, Entered my room the other day, Who, just before, I had been told, Had something which he wished to say. With modest grace, he made his bow, I marked the tear-drop in his eye, And kindly asked himââWell, what now?â When, sobbing, thus he made reply:â âI found that peach delicious food! And I enjoyed it, while at play; My dear papa, oh, you are good! And that is what I had to say.â It was the gush of gratitude That tuned his voice and filled his eye; âFather of mercies! thou art good To all who dwell beneath the sky.â This child has taught me how to pray, And how express my thanks to thee; What better language can we say, Than what this infant said to me? âFather of mercies, thou art good!â Is language fraught with filial love, Glowing with heartfelt gratitude, An incense which thou wilt approve. Oh, grant me grace to breathe it still, When I would speak my gratitude For blessings which my goblet fillâ âFather of mercies, thou art good!â THE WIDOW. We parted: oh! it was a painful hour! Not that I thought him lost to me for ever, I knew that mighty love's resistless power Would re-unite us, ne'er again to sever; For we are weddedânot as thoughtless mortals, Incited only by terrestial views, Enter that sacred fane's mysterious portals. Our souls are wedded; that assurance strews My widowed path with flowers of fadeless hues. Yet is the briefest parting hard; for love, Deprived of wisdom, is a rayless sun; A summer midnight, when no star above Throws down one cheering ray; 't is GOOD, alone, Without her partner TRUTH; or it resembles Warm melting CHARITY, intent to bless, When without FAITH to guide her steps, she trembles O'er the dark scene of human wretchedness, Wondering if Heaven permits or wills distress. 'T was hard to part; and while his spirit hovered On the cold lips my kisses could not warm, I prayed and murmured; but, alas! when covered By the dark pall, they bore that manly form To its cold grave, I lost the pang of sorrow, For reason fled, and I 'd a dreamless sleep; But woke, in anguish, on the coming morrow, No more to murmur, pray, or even weep, For grief is ever silent when it 's deep. Humbled to earth, my self-upbraiding soul, With mental tongue, exclaimed, Thy will be done! When, through my bosom, such a feeling stole As mocks the power of language; it was one Of those delicious thrills of nameless rapture We feel, when conscience, Heaven, and friends approve; When earthly joys have lost their power to capture; For Reuben's spirit whispered, âPeace, sweet dove, We're joined for ever, in Conjugial Love. From the Latin term conjugiale, a higher degree of union than is understood by the term conjugal, which is from the Latin word conjugale. SUNDAY-SCHOOL HYMN. O Thou, whose eye, with mercy mild, Surveys the sinner's bended knee, Thou, who wast once a little child, As tender and as young as we; Dear Jesus, Saviour, Father, Friend, To thee our lisping tongues would raiseâ While humbly at thy feet we bendâ A song of gratitude and praise. 'T was thy creating Word that made All things below and all above, Where we admiring see displayed Thy matchless wisdom, power, and love. 'T was thy redeeming love that raised, Our souls from ruin, sin, and wo; Then let thy holy name be praised, By all good children here below. And may those hearts thy love inclined To bless our souls with heavenly light, To pour instructions o'er the mind, Enshrined in ignorance and nightâ May they enjoy a rich reward, In conscious virtue's sweet repast; Oh bless them while on earth, dear Lord, And take them to thyself at last. ON HEARING A SERMON ON THE PLEASURES OF RELIGION. When o'er the sacred desk, with modest grace And lowly meekness, bends thy reverend form, While the great theme that animates thy face, Bids every bosom glow with transport warmâ How could I listen to the heavenly theme, Forget the pleasures that entice me here, Think human life a transitory dream, And wish, with thee, to gain a higher sphere! Go on, thou champion in the cause of truth, Armed by thy Saviour, still the foe engage; Still charm from vice the steps of ardent youth, And strew with rosy hopes the path of age. FAITH. My little girl, the other day, (Three years of age a month ago,) Wounded her finger while at play, And saw the crimson fluid flow. With pleading optics, raining tears, She sought my aid, in terror wild; I smiling said, âDismiss your fears, And all shall soon be well, my child.â Her little bosom ceased to swell, While she replied with calmer brow, âI know that you can make it well, But how, papa?âI do n't see how.â Our children oft instruct us thus; For succor, or for recompense, They look with confidence to us, As we should look to Providence. For each infantile doubt and fear, And every little childish grief, Is uttered to a parent's ear, With full assurance of relief. A grateful sense of favors past, Incites them to petition now, With faith in succor to the last, Although they can 't imagine how. And shall I doubtingly repine, When clouds of dark affliction lower? A tenderer Father still is mine, Of greater mercy, love, and power: He clothes the lily, feeds the dove, The meanest insect feels his care; And shall not man confess his love, Man, his own offspring, and his heir? Yes, though he slay, I'll trust him still, And still with resignation bow; He may relieve, he can, he willâ Although I can not yet see how. THE SOLAR SYSTEM. Behold yon orbs, in paths harmonious, run Their destined courses round the parent sun; Grand correspondent of that Sun above, Whose light is wisdom, and whose heat is love. There terra rollsâa speck upon the sky, Less than a speck to some more distant eye; Suppose, that on the surface of that ball Myriads of little thinking insects crawl, Whose trembling spark of life, at longest, burns While round the sun they make an hundred turns And then expire; suppose your eye could trace The various movements of this tiny race; Suppose you saw a few ambitious mites Attempt to lord it o'er their fellows' rights; Or viewed a host, who placed their hope and trust In hoarding glittering grains of yellow dust; Or thousands, whose ambition but aspired To see their gaudy hues awhile admired; Or millions, whose less innocent intents, Concentrate in the groveling joys of senseâ Would you not think they marred their Maker's plan? Then blush, proud mortalâsuch, alas! is man: Such follies, or such crimes, apply to all The busy insects of our native ballâ And were not aid divine in mercy given, Each had for ever lost his destined heaven. But think not, vainly, that the human race Is limited to such contracted space; Dream not that those bright orbs were set on high, To run their various courses through the sky, For ornament aloneâignoble thought, To reason listen, and be better taught! Know that Eternal Love conceived the plan, And love eternal rests at last on man; For each effect its energies produce, Is wrought by wisdom, and its end is use; Hence learn that every moving, twinkling light That decks the azure vault of heaven at night, Is round a central sun resistless hurled, Itself a ponderous globeâa peopled world: A world, perhaps, unstained by crime or blood, Where social love prefers its neighbor's good; Where every joy derives its sweetest zest From the fond wish of making others blest; Where heaven-born charity exerts her powersâ A world of bliss, as man might render ours. Such peopled orbs in countless numbers fly In never-varying order through the sky; And all with one accordant voice proclaim, The power which made and still supports thei frame. Presumptuous Atheist! if such wretch exist, Can thy vain reasoning proofs like these resist? Say, can these planets, in harmonious dance, Perform their revolutions thus by chance? Perish the thought!ârise from thy native clod Renounce thy error, and confess a God! For though with every mortal honor clad, âAn undevout Astronomer is mad;â Conviction seals thy lipsâpresume no more, But in mute wonder tremble and adore. MY MOTHER'S GRAVE. WRITTEN IN A COUNTRY BURIAL-PLACE, IN SCITUATE, MASSACHUSETTS. [A JUVENILE PRODUCTION.] Aurora paints the orient skies with light, With rosy pencil tinges every cloud, Unfolds her gates upon the rear of Night, And strips the mountains of his sable shroud. The conscious stars conceal their twinkling fires, Night's waning impress turns more sickly pale, Her votary the whizzing bat retires, The owl suspends her harsh complaining tale. The lark awakes and tunes his matin song, And all the sylvan warblers join the theme; The whistling ploughman drives his team along, And sporting swans sail stately down the stream. Adieu, dull couch! for Nature more can please, While o'er her rich enamelled breast I stray, Inhaling sweets which freight the balmy breeze, Stolen in kisses from the lips of May. The peach-bloom in the breathing zephyr plays, And shakes soft odors from its silken leaves; The apple, too, a silver garb displays, Whence morning's breath a rich perfume receives. Here let me stray, adown this mossy ridge; Observe yon streamlet o'er the pebbles creep; Pass o'er its little, rude-constructed bridge, To where, in silence, all our fathers sleep. Oh may I never pass this sacred spot, Unmindful of the dust these walls enclose: For here, partaking in the common lot, A tender Mother's relics find repose! Here various stones, on various models planned, Discriminate between the rich and poor; Some richly sculptured by an artist's hand, Some rudely lettered, and adorned no more. But filial love and sorrow soon discern The humble state they consecrated here; The drooping willow weeping o'er the urn, The quoted motto, and the name most dear. Yes 't is the sameâbeneath this turfy heap Lowly reclines the form which gave me birth; Those arms, the cradle of my earliest sleep, Are nerveless now, and mingling with the earth. Those lips, whose accents could my cares remove, Are sealed in silence, stiffened, cold, and dead! Those eyes, which beamed with fond, maternal love, Are closed in darkness, and their lustre fled. Oh, dear departed! venerable shade! If earthly objects can thy notice claim, Accept the tribute filial love has paid, The pearly gem that glitters on thy name. Though five sad years their destined course have run, Since death confined thy mortal body here, Yet can not thy poor, sorrowing, orphan son, Review the spot unmoistened with a tear. Hard fate forbade, when nature's tenderest ties Where severed by the lingering stroke of death, That filial love should close thy sunken eyes, Or from thy lips to kiss the parting breath. Forgive thy son, indulgent parent, this, As he forgives the fate he could not move; Though oft in duty he has been remiss, This last neglect was not from want of love. For, weeks before, when wasting nature knew The struggle fruitless for her forfeit breath, Thy wish I heard, and with impatience flew To kiss thy cheek before it sunk in death. When faithful memory recalls with pain This last, sad duty which I paid to theeâ A final parting, ne'er to meet again, Till from the world and its corruptions freeâ I feel the son in all my moving soul; How truly so, these starting tears reveal; The sacred drops shall meet with no control! Affection's tear what son would e'er conceal? Then was the mother all alive in thee; What wholesome counsel from thy lips I drewâ Which in my breast shall ever treasured beâ The only legacy I had from you! Since then, dear parent, Joy has seldom smiled Upon thy sonâsevere has been his fateâ The world was newâan inexperienced child Its friendship soughtâbut only gained its hate! He hoped from Fortune but a cheering smile, But like the world she frowned upon his claim; He then pursued a fleeting shade awhileâ But broke a bubble when he grasped at Fame! His only respite, now, from mental pain, Is o'er his native rural scenes to roam; A view of this sequestered spot to gain, Or when away to think of thee and home! The green turf swells above thy mouldering clay, The moss has strewed it with the softest felt; The violets here their loveliest hues display, To deck the bed on which he oft has knelt. This humble stone, which fond affection placed, To mark the spot, and to preserve thy name, Though by a rude, unlettered artist traced, On his regard has more than marble's claim. Sacred to thee for ever may it stand; Forbear, O Time! the tablet to destroy, Whose lay disarms the king of terror's handâ âDeath is the gate to everlasting joy.â This truth believed, no more shall baseless fear Attend the word that speaks of leaving earth; We seek for happinessâit dwells not here; In heaven alone are joys of lasting worth. Here some repose who scarce received their birth, Ere death consigned them to the silent tomb; Small, though sufficient, is their lot of earthâ The flowers, transplanted, will for ever bloom. No age is free from Death's insatiate bow, His shafts are levelled, and his victims fall! The rose of infancy, or fourscore snow, Alike avail not, he must conquer all. Those rustic biers against the wall reclined, The wasting bearers of the archer's prey, Impress this serious truth upon the mindâ Existence is not certain for a day! How oft this pious, all-important theme Hast thou impressed upon thy list'ning boy, My much-loved mother!âbut the playful dream Of childhood, pictured only scenes of joy. Then would we come, my little sisters too, And one fond brother, through this yard to stray; Our destined beds beneath the sod to view, Survey these stones, and read the uncouth lay. Then, as the shades of evening veiled the plains, Back to yon mansion we would gayly stroll, The humble benefice which still sustains The careful guardian of the Christian soul. Beneath that roof I first inhaled the air, Poor were my parents, hard they earned their bread, Rich only in a reputation fair, And owned no mansion where to lay the head. Along yon streamlet, where the whisp'ring reeds And fragrant flags upon its borders play, Where through those cedars it meand'ring leads, My infant footsteps first were taught to stray. And how a mother's tender, anxious care, Has oft deprived me of this little joy! The last love-pledge of this connubial pair, Their fears were ever wakeful for the boy. The sylvan muse enticed me to her cell, My childish fingers wantoned o'er her lyreâ Bade the rude strain, untaught, to wildly swell, While to the sound each throbbing pulse beat higher. Then as I grew and learned to sweep the strings By art directed, though less sweetly wild, I envied not the happiest of kings, My lyre was bliss, and I a happy child. But why recount the joys of childhood o'er? That happy state with all its joys has fled! As fade the beauties of the tender flower, When Winter beats upon its drooping head. But see! the ocean sparkles on the sight, What lovely hues upon its surface play! The liquid mirror streams with dazzling light, Reflecting from the rising god of day. He comes! and Nature hails his gladd'ning beams, New life pervades her animated part; Nor less improved the vegetable seems, Its charms increase, and laugh at mimic art. Not long ago, adown the western skies He sank, and left the mourning world in gloom; But only sank at night, again to rise, In tenfold splendor, from his watery tomb. So, though we sink beneath the verdant sod, And leave our friends in mounful weeds and tears, We only sink to rise and dwell with God An age unmeasured by successive years. There we shall meet, dear mother, yet again! Thou art but gone before a little while; There joy is endless, unalloyed with pain, There an eternal round of summers smile. Fly swift, ye winged hours, and be my lot To count but few, ere death shall aim the dart; Then lowly let me rest beneath this spot, And lose the anguish of an aching heart. Short be my life, yet then, if sorrows count, A lengthened age should clothe my head in snow; Oh could my virtues gain but their amount, Perfection would have once been found below. Adieu, dear spot! necessity commands The youth who loves you far from hence away! But while a thought of home his breast expands, Your dear remembrance never can decay! SHE IS NOT HERE. She is not hereâ't is but her veil of clay That moulders into dust beneath this stone; Mary herself, in realms of endless day, Has put a robe of fadeless glory on. This monumental urn is not designed To tell of beauties withering in the tomb; Her brightest charms were centred in a mind Which still survives, and will for ever bloom. Yet may this marble teach the solemn truth. That virtue only can true bliss impart; While neither friendship, beauty, health, nor youth, Can shield the breast from death's insatiate dart. ON THE DEATH OF A CHILD. In life's parterre, what numerous germs disclose The loveliest tints, the sweetest blushing dyes! The enraptured florist views the opening rose, Screens it from every ruder wind that blows, And richer future charms in embryo espies. But, ah! the spoiler stalks abroad, whose breath Is pestilence, whose chilling touch is death! With merciless hand he crops the flower, And all its promised beauty fliesâ It falls beneath his baneful power, Its sweets are scattered in an hour; It shrinks, it withers, droops, and dies. Yet, mourn not, ye, whose fostering love and care To culture a beloved plant has failed; 'T is but transplanted to a garden, where Eternal summer smiles; 't will flourish there In living hues, by spoilers unassailed. ON THE DEATH OF AN INFANT. Almighty God! 'tis right, 'tis just, That earthly frames should turn to dust; But, ah! forgive the wishful tear, That would detain a spirit here. Go, gentle babe, to realms of bliss, The chastening rod we humbly kiss; Thy Saviour calls thee home, my son, And let his holy will be done. Thy earthly form, now icy cold, Was framed in beauty's fairest mould; But now, prepared by love divine, A fairer, brighter form is thine. Thy earthly parents loved thee wellâ So much, that language fails to tell; But, ah! our love was weak and poor, Thy heavenly Parent loves thee more. Here, thou wert tenderly caressed, Upon a fond maternal breast; But angel-nurses, forms of love, Shall now caress my babe above. Fain would paternal love have taught Thy little opening world of thought; But we the pleasing task resign To heavenly schools, and books divine. 'T was all our thoughts and wishes still To guard our darling here from ill; But that great God who called thee home, Has saved from greater ills to come. Then let us hush the rising sigh, And bid affliction's tear be dry; Our child still lives, his sorrows o'er, Where we shall meet to part no more. There, shall the sweet maternal kiss, Increase his joyâenhance his bliss; There, through redeeming love and grace, The father shall his son embrace. Almighty God! 't is right, 't is just, That earthly frames should turn to dust; But, oh! the sweet, transporting truthâ The soul shall bloom in endless youth. FLORIANâA MONODY. My lyre, which erst to friendship tuned, I woke In strains the sacred theme inspired, While with its flame the glowing chords were fired, Ah! sad exchange! the tie of friendship broke, By death dissolved, must make its sadder theme! While every falling note with wo shall teem! To Florian's early fate the muse shall pay Sincere affection's purest lay; The emanation of a grief-fraught soul, The real feelings of an honest heart, Unfeigned, and unadorned by art, Who all her paler hues from Nature stole. Ye youths, ye virgin train, Whose eyes to his responsive smiled, When festive rites the hours beguiled, With me complain! Me, whom the closer link of friendship joined To his expanded heartâwhere truth, combined With every glowing grace, superior shone; With me commingle sympathetic tears, While faithful Memory shall own His worth, his virtues, past! She bids retrace the journey of his years, Review the path, nor see a blemish cast. Flushed by the balmy spring of youth, he rose, In life's parterre, a flower of fairest hue; Denied affection's fostering, pearly dew, Parental sunshineâyet his tints disclose Beauty internalâfragrance all his own; Benevolence conspicuous shone, And nectared charity distilled In grateful odors!âWho beheld him bloom And yet their love withheld? Who, could they have foreseen his early doom, But would have shed anticipated tears; Withheld the victim from the insatiate tomb, If prayers could hold, for many, many years? But prayers, nor youth, nor virtue, nought avail Against diseases, ministers of death! The tyrant claims our forfeit breath, And who his claim withstands? Entreaties fail! One gift alone can make us scorn the foe, Though not his shaft evade; The heavenly gift our Saviour brought below, Religion, sweet, celestial maid! By thee sustained, the darkened path grows bright, And leads to realms of everlasting light! Cease, then, my tears, to flow, Cease, sighs, to murmur wo, This peerless guide my friend secured, While he the ills of life endured; Cheered by a seraph's song, The youth she led along The gloomy pathâits roughness fled, And Terror hid his grisly head; The gate of Paradise displayed Cherubs in robes of light arrayed: And songs re-echoed through the empyreal dome, As heavenly minstrels hailed him welcome home! But selfish Sorrow will intrudeâ The loss is oursâand Nature will be heard Till Sorrow is subdued By cooler Reason's unimpassioned sway; The worth we loved, the virtues we revered, We must lament when torn away. So young, to fall! but youth, as hoary age, Finds no respect! The infant dies When scarcely entered on the stage; His part to ope, and then to close his eyes. Some claim a longer scene, and bustle round Their little walk, with rant and sound; The curtain drops, and they are seen no more! Few labor onward through the tedious play Till life's allotted, farthest verge is o'er, Then fall like fruit when autumn melts away. Thus is it ordered, Order's Source to please; Who will impeach his infinite decrees? Granted, 't is justâyet sympathy must weepâ To see him hastening to the silent dead Without a kindred tear of sorrow shed! Nor bosom where to fall asleep! Nor hand to close his eyes! Strangers that mournful task performed! Yet strangers here were friends; their tears, their sighs, From bosoms flowed by purest feelings warmed. Friends tied by nature could no more; Nor more sincerely such a loss deplore. Might fond fraternal offices assuage The pangs of sore disease?âthese too denied! For ah! a brother still of lesser age, At distance languished, while his brother died! No tender sister weeping o'er his bed! No anxious father soothing with his love! No mother! God! I touch a tender string! My heart's acutest nerveâits vital thread; Struck too unkindly, tears of crimson move, And wakened sorrow whets her blunted sting! Oh, grant, ye powers that rule the lives of all, If I am doomed, like him I mourn, to fallâ Far from the bosom of my home, Where fate may call, and I may roamâ Oh, grant my wishâmay hearts like those which bled O'er Florian's corse, mourn too for me; Such be the strangers round my bed; Such be the tears they shed Whoe'er they be: Such be the sacred care my ashes find, When death has closed the scene: Such be the impression on the youthful mind, When followers round my grave convene; But more than allâmay I, like him, arise, And join my friend in worlds beyond the skies. ON THE DEATH OF MISS ANNA GREENLEAF. Her guardian angel, who had roved Through scenes of heavenly bliss, Hovered around the child she loved, To steal affection's kiss. âA lovely girl!â the child exclaimed, âA beauteous form I see, A messenger with love inflamed, And she has come for me!â Her mother closed the infant's eyes, Who 'd meekly suffered much; And Anna's spirit sought the skies, Led by seraphic touch. âWhat bringst thou then?â the Saviour saidâ The messenger replies:â âA Green leaf rising from the dead, To bloom in paradise!â His arms did then her form enfold, And said, âMy word was given, When I sojourned on earth of old, That such should people heaven! âThen welcome, meek one, thou hast loved, With filial love, thy duty, And now from earth thou art removed, Here thou shall bloom in beauty.â EPITAPHS. ON A YOUTH. Oh, that the icy touch of death should blight, Just in the bloom of youth, a form so bright; When smiling hope illumed a cultured mind, Rich in endowments of the fairest kind! By all respected, by the good approved, By kindred hearts, how tenderly beloved! Yet, cease to mournâfor virtue can not dieâ The youth still lives in realms beyond the sky. ON A WIFE AND MOTHER. 'T is filial love that consecrates this earth To female virtue and maternal worth; Sacred to one who filled the parts of life, As daughter, sister, mother, friend, and wife. And filled them well, through each successive stage, From playful childhood to declining age; Till mercy whispered to her soulââWell done! Enter to bliss, thou good and faithful one!â AH! SEEK NOT READER. Ah! seek not reader, worth like his to learn From chiselled tablet, or a âstoried urn;â For who to senseless marble can impart The faintest impress of an angel's heart? The widowed hand which consecrates this stone, Would make her love, not his perfections known; For all a husband, parent, friend, should be, All heaven approves, or man admires, was he. ON AN INFANT. Stain not this urn with sorrow's tear, Nought but a blighted leaf is here; The cherished flower, not fully blown, Its opening beauties scarcely known, Was severed from its earthly stem, To deck an angel's diadem. ON A CHARMING AND MUCH LAMENTED FEMALE. This humble stone is meant to show That Anna's vesture lies below; But she who wore itâshe we love, Is in her bridal dress above. MISCELLANEOUS POEMS. A COLLOQUY WITH THE MUSE. This and the two following poems were, by the author, âaddressed to my friend, George P. Morris, Esq.â The muse and myself, the other day, Held a short colloquy together; For she sometimes calls, when she comes that way, Though scarcely a moment she deigns to stay, And seldom has anything to say, Save, âhow d' ye doâwhat news to-day! 'T is really charming weather.â She found me alone, in my elbow chairâ One arm has long been brokenâ In the attic, Georgeâyou well know where, For once, last summer, I saw you there, When you kindly offered to pay my fare, If I'd brush my coat, and with you repair To breathe a mouthful of country air, On the heights of green Hoboken. As I said before, her ladyship came, En dishabille, as usual, In costume resembling the slipshod dame Whose Black-book sketches are known to fame. Her robe was blue, and her hose the same, Her sandals unlaced, and her gait was lame, As she entered the room, and pronounced my name In a manner and tone fiducial. âGood day t' ye, Reubenâdo n't ask me to stay, For I must hasten home to my toilet; As I go out with Norna a-shopping to-day, And Hinda goes with usâbesides, I must pay A visit to Thirzaâit 's all in our way, And then to Ianthe I 've something to say; Besides, I must call upon Wetmore and Fay, And then there would be the Old Nick to pay, If I did n't look in upon Morris tooâeigh! But now, while I think of itâReuben, do say, Who is that comical Cox?âI will lay He is building a fame that will never decay; And so is my favorite Proteusânay, No jealousy, Reuben, but win your own bay, And never let envy soil it. âHush! do n't interrupt meâthere 's tender Estelle, Everard, Lara, and Alpha, and Inman, Isidora, or Harrietâwith sweet Isabelle, And hundreds of others, are like to excel, If they treat me politely. But, Reuben, do tell, If I don't appear charming in this dishabille? Say, why the deuce do you grin, man?â âYou look,â I replied, âboth ugly and old, In these rascally dishabille dresses; Why, when you are visiting others, I'm told, The finest light gossamer vestures infold That form and those limbs of such exquite mould, With sandals that sparkle with spangles and gold, While a chaplet of roses and diamonds untold, Confine those wandering tresses. âWhen others petition, you make reply, In numbers of sweetest measure, But to me you prate, like a chattering pie, Of shopping, and visits, and a few small fry Of Mirror contributorsâwhile here, poor I In silence must wait your leisure! âWhy not on me such favors bestow As your other votaries win? Why prattle to me on subjects so low, In a tuneless, senseless din?â âWhy, then, you must know,â She said with a smile, âThat, when here below, I adapt my style To the company I am in. âBut, jesting apart, what is it you claim? I'll grant you the boon, I swear it: That is, if I'm ableâcome, give it a name.â âThen fire me, at once,â I replied, âwith the flame That animates Halleck, and lights him to fame; To a like dazzling summit direct my aim, Procure for my numbers an equal acclaim; Secure me a chaplet as brightânot the same, And teach me as humbly to wear it.â She smiling replied, while her head she shookâ âIn vain should I bid you take it; For Apollo, when late, with a shepherd's crook, He toyed with a maid, by a gurgling brook, Had concealed his lyre in a private nook, Which Halleck observed, and slyly took, And none but Halleck can wake it.â NAY, ASK ME NOT FOR WIT OR RHYME. Nay, ask me not for wit or rhyme, While this blue-devil weather lasts, The muses shun Columbia's clime During the equinoctial blasts. Their native home is most serene, Where bright and cloudless skies are certain, A mountain's-topâas you have seen At Chatham Garden, on the curtain. They'll not exchange a scene so fair, Their verdant walks and rural sweets, To shiver in this misty air, And wade along our muddy streets. Then let them still enjoy their revels, Remote from fiends of every hue, For though they smile on some poor devils, They never could abide the blue. In July last, so hot and dry, When some expired for want of brandy, When not a cloud obscured the sky, And fans were worn by every dandy: Then would they come, and round my taper, En dishabille, inspire me so, That, though my sweat bedewed the paper, I wrote some melting lines, you know. But ask me not for wit or rhyme, While this blue-devil weather lasts, The muses shun Columbia's clime During the equinoctial blasts. FASHIONS. How fashions change in this inconstant world! Powder and queues held undisputed sway When I was young; anon, the hair was curled, And, after that, the top-knot had its day. The last, I understand, has given way To Saunders' plain-cropt crown. So much for menâ The ladiesâbless their pretty faces!âmay Recount a thousand changes to our ten. There were the huge crape cushion, hoop, and stays, To go no further back;âmy mother wore them Before her marriage;âand, in after days, I 've heard her wish that fashion might restore them. Short waists, and long, have had alternate sway, Since hoops were banished, to the present day. And I have prized them allâfor I confess, 'T is my opinion, that the virtuous fair, While they derive no one new charm from dress, Impart a charm to every dress they wear. But Fashion's freaks, we know, are not confined To the habiliments her votaries wear; She even dictates to the immortal MIND, And deigns to take beneath her tender care Celestial genius, fancy, taste, and wit, And e'en religion, too, must oft submit; For since great Johnson frowned upon dissenters, 'T is the established church that Fashion enters; And were each pun a diamond, she 'd not take one, Because the doctor had not wit to make one; Just as the fox condemned the grapes as sour, Because he found them not within his power. Mark but the movements of the goddess, through A few short years: Moore's Lyrics were in fashion, Till Byron's vision burst upon the view, Scattering, from demon wings, a storm of passion. Then fashion taught her votaries to adore The idol which tempestuous clouds environ, And left the sweet elysian fields of Moore, To wander o'er the Upas realms of Byron, With bones of human victims covered o'er, Or to the snow-capt mountain trembling soar, Where huge volcanoes vomit quenchless flame, Fierce as his soul, and brilliant as his fame. Scott was, awhile, the star of the ascendant, (If Scott wrote Waverley and Kenilworth), And dazzled with a glory as resplendent As ever beamed upon the moral earth Since Shakespeare lived, whose magic pen Explored the very souls of men: Like his, for painting character and passion, The muse of Waverley was long in fashion. With all such changes in proud Albion's clime, Allowing, say a month, for transportation, Their humble parasites have here kept time, In dress and morals, taste and conversation. 'T is true, our wondrous spirit of invention Has added to the stock of information, And there are some improvements I could mention, That add new lustre to our reputation. Awhile ago, and Greece was all the rage, That is, we felt enraged against the Turks, And every daily paper had a page Filled up entirely with their bloody worksâ With battles, massacres, heroic deeds, And self-devotedness of patriot men, And cruelties at which the bosom bleeds, When memory calls the picture back again. Wives, mothers, maids, compelled to slay themselves, Or yield to these infernal turbaned elves. One general burst of honest indignation Was heard throughout the land; our public halls Echoed to strains of lofty declamation, Or sweeter strains of fiddlesâfor our balls, And every other pastime, were intended To aid the cause which Grecian arms defended. To save their sisters from such cruel foes, Our patriot ladies danced with ceaseless ardor, As some say masses for the sake of those Whose destiny below is somewhat harder. Whole families were doomed to starve for weeks, (Who had no banker whom to draw for cash on), For splendid dresses worn to aid the Greeks! But, recollect, the Greeks were then in fashion. Fayette, who helped to make Columbia free, The man whom free-born millions now revere, Great Lafayette, the friend of Liberty, Has been in fashion more than half a year; And will be so for centuries, no doubt, For millions yet unborn shall shout his name, And seek the dangerous path he singled out To reach the summit of immortal fame. Canals are much in vogue at present, though 'T was once the fashion to oppose them; From Maine to Georgia now, they 're all the go, And half her real wealth Columbia owes them. E'en Darien, whose adamantine throne Still dares two kindred oceans to divide, Is doomed to see its empire overthrown, And commerce o'er its ruins proudly ride. But there 's one fashion I must not forget On this occasionâone that's worth commending, And justly venerated, you'll admit, For its antiquity;â't is that of sending To some one we esteem on New Year's day A short, familiar, tributary lay, Such as I now address to you, Deficient both in sentiment and passion, But ending with kind wishes, warm and trueâ Accept it, Georgeâfor I must be in fashion. May every bliss that Heaven can give be yours, While the brief term of human life endures; Domestic joys, a moderate share of wealth, Contented mind, vivacity, and health; Friends that are faithful, able, and refined, Children obedientâconsort true and kind; The will and means the child of want to save, And thus secure a fund beyond the grave. If these be yours, there can not be a fear But you will hail with joy the infant year. AN ODE, FOR THE GRAND CANAL CELEBRATION, NOV. 4, 1825. 'Tis done, 'tis done!âThe mighty chain Which joins bright Erie to the Main, For ages, shall perpetuate The glory of our native state. 'T is done!âProud Art o'er Nature has prevailed! Genius and perseverance have succeeded! Though selfish Prejudice assailed, And honest Prudence pleaded. 'T is done!âThe monarch of the briny tide, Whose giant arm encircles earth, To virgin Erie is allied, A bright-eyed nymph of mountain birth. To-day, the sire of Ocean takes A sylvan maiden to his arms, The goddess of the crystal lakes, In all her native charms! She comes! attended by a sparkling train; The Naiads of the West her nuptials grace; She meets the sceptred father of the main, And in his heaving bosom hides her virgin face Rising from their watery cells, Tritons sport upon the tide, And gayly blow their trumpet-shells, In honor of the bride. Sea-nymphs leave their coral caves, Deep beneath the ocean waves, Where they string, with tasteful care Pearls upon their sea-green hair. Thetis' virgin train advances, Mingling in the bridal dances; Jove, himself, with raptured eye, Throws his forkÃ©d thunders by, And bids Apollo seize his golden lyre, A strain of joy to wake; While Fame proclaims that Ocean's sire Is wedded to the goddess of the lake. The smiling god of song obeys, And heaven re-echoes with his sounding lays. All hail to the Art which unshackles the soul! And fires it with love of glory! And causes the victor, who reaches the goal, To live in deathless story! âWhich teaches young Genius to rise from earth, On Fancy's airy pinion, To assert the claims of its heavenly birth, And seize on its blest dominion. âThe Art which the banner of Truth unfurled, When darkness veiled each nation, And prompted Columbus to seek a new world On the unexplored map of creation. âWhich lighted the path of the pilgrim band, Who braved the storms of ocean, To seek, in a wild and distant land, The freedom of pure devotion. âWhich kindled, on Freedom's shrine, a flame That will glow through future ages, And cover with glory and endless fame Columbia's immortal sages. âThe Art which enabled her Franklin to prove, And solve each mystic wonder! To arrest the forked shafts of Jove, And play with his bolts of thunder. âThe Art, which enables her sons to aspire, Beyond all the wonders in story; For an unshackled PRESS is the pillar of fire Which lights them to Freedom and Glory. â'T is this which called forth the immortal decree, And gave the great work its first motion; 'T is done! by the hands of the brave and free, And Erie is linked to the Ocean. âThen hail to the Art which unshackles the soul, And fires it with love of glory, And causes the victor who reaches the goal, To live in deathless story.â Such strainsâif earthly strains may be Compared to his who tunes a heavenly lyreâ Are warbled by the bright-haired deity, While listening orbs admire. Such strains shall unborn millions yet awake, While, with her golden trumpet, smiling Fame Proclaims the union of the main and lake, And on her scroll emblazons Clinton's name. THE GRAND CANAL. While millions awaken to Freedom the chorus, In wreathing for valor the blood-sprinkled bay, The new brilliant era which opens before us, Demands the rich tribute of gratitude's lay; For ours is a boast unexampled in story, Unequalled in splendor, unrivalled in grace, A conquest that gains us a permanent glory, The triumph of science o'er matter and space! For realms that were dreary, are now smiling cheery, Since Hudson and Erie like sisters embrace. From heroes whose wisdom and chivalrous bearing Secured us the rights which no power can repeal, Have spirits descended as brilliantly daring, To fix on the charter Eternity's seal. Behold them consummate the giant conception, Unwearied in honor's beneficent race, While nature submits to the daring surreption, And envy and ignorance shrink in disgrace. For realms that were dreary, are now smiling cheery, Since Hudson and Erie like sisters embrace. The nymphs of our rivers, our lakes, and our fountains, Are now by the monarch of ocean caressed; While spurning the barriers of forests and mountains, Bold Commerce enriches the wilds of the West. Then hail to the sages, whose wisdom and labors Conceived and perfected the brilliant design; Converting the remotest strangers to neighbors, By weaving a ligament nought can disjoin; For regions once dreary, are now smiling cheery, Since Hudson and Erie like their waters combine. And long, thus devoted to festival pleasure, This day shall be sacred to genius and worth, For millions unborn shall rejoice at a measure, Which renders our country the pride of the earth. No sectional feelings now mar our communion, Affection and interest are reckless of space, The national good is the bond of our union, Which ages shall brighten but never deface. For realms that were dreary, are now smiling cheery, Since Hudson and Erie like sisters embrace. DURANT'S ADDRESS. ON ASCENDING WITH A BALLOON FROM CASTLE GARDEN. âI'm for the airââ't is sweet to fly On silken pinions, towards the sky, To leave a world of strife and wo With all its follies far below; While bending, Godlike, from my car, Responsive to the loud huzza! With Freedom's flag of various hue, I wave the wondering crowds adieu! âI'm for the airââ't is sweet to rise Above the proud, the great, the wise; 'T is pleasant to look down and see Admiring thousands gaze at me! 'T is transport o'er their heads to soar, Who downward looked on me before; Ambition's bliss must be complete, With all the world beneath its feet! âI'm for the airââwhere science hath Opened a bright effulgent path; And though my car, this time, must sail Obedient to the passing gale, Have patience, and no distant day, Shall see me steer another way; Across the current shape my course, Or, like the eagle, stem its force. âI'm for the airââye sons of earth, With spirits of ethereal birth; Could thanks in real blessings fall, I'd pour a deluge on you all. But fare you well! I mountâI fly! This, Science, is thy victory! Hail to a scene sublimely grand! Hail!âhail Columbia! happy land! THE ÃRONAUT'S ADDRESS. Good-bye to you, people of earth, I am soaring to regions above you; But much that I know of your worth, Will ever induce me to love you. Perhaps I may touch at the moon, To give your respects as I pass, sirs, And learn if the spheres are in tune, Or if they are lighted with gas, sirs. I will measure those mystical things That encircle the spherule of Saturn, With Jupiter's belts and his rings, And draw out a chart for a pattern. Then take my departure for Mars, Perhaps I'll look down upon Venus; Then mount to the galaxy stars, And leave all the planets between us. The light, milky-way I will trace, Then, while I am travelling from it, Through unexplored regions of space, I'll seize on the tail of a comet. The zodiac circle I'll run, Examine the twelve constellations, Then count all the spots on the sun, And extinguish the north corruscations. I then shall descend to the earth, And visit the chief of the Tartars, Ascertain what his turban is worth, And the cost of his favorite's garters. At China, I think I'll take tea, At India some fruit I'll regale on, And then over mountain and sea, To Africa fearlessly sail on. I'll visit the French at Algiers, Where the lily now flourishes solus, And wipe away Portugal's tears, By giving Don Miguel a bolus. While Ferdinand vainly bewails The loss of his Mexican mines, sirs, I will call upon Charles at Versailles, To taste of his venison and wines, sirs. With William the Fourth I will waste No language of sycophant flattery, But cross the Atlantic in haste, And safely return to the battery. Then, huzza! for the sons of the West, The country of freedom and honor, A home for the brave and opprest, May blessings be lavished upon her. AN ÃRONAUT'S FAREWELL. A brief farewell to one and all, I can no more delay, This huge distended silken ball, Must bear me hence away. And while I fearlessly soar afar, Through trackless fields of blue, Columbia's banner o'er my car, Shall wave my brief adieu. Accept my thanks for favors past, My hope for more to come, For this short flight is not my last, If I get safely home. Your favor is my polar star, My heart will point to you, As from my little wicker ear I wave you all adieu. My chariot waitsâand yet awhile I fondly linger nigh, To catch another cheering smile From Beauty's sparkling eye. A thousand thanksâmy buoyant heart, Expands with transport newâ Nowânow I'm ready to depart, The cord is cutâadieu! NEWSPAPERS. A PARAPHRASE ON PART OF COWPER'S TASK. 'T is pleasant, through the loopholes of retreat, (So Cowper sang, in strains divinely sweet,) To peep at such a world; and as it turns, Survey at ease, the globe and its concerns; To seem advanced to more than mortal height, With this vast spherule rolling in your sight; To view the noisy Babel from a cloud, Behold the bustle, and not feel the crowd; To hear the mighty din she sends around, At a safe distance, where the dying sound Fall a soft murmur on the uninjured ear, And thus to scan the whole without a fear. The sound of war, if such a scene you view, Loses its terrors ere it reaches you; And desolation, caused by hostile arms, Excites your pity, grieves, but not alarms; Perhaps you mourn the avarice and pride That render man a cruel fratricide; And at the echo of those thunders start, In which he speaks the language of his heart; Perhaps you wonder as it floats around, And sigh, but never tremble, at the sound. As roves the bee, when vernal flowers expand, So roves the traveller from land to land, Where manners, customs, policy, and scenes, Pay contributions to the stores he gleans; Still like the bee, in Summer's blushing prime, He sucks intelligence from every clime; And on returning to his native shores, He thus spreads out his hoarded, honied stores, And welcomes allâa rich repast for you, For, as he travelled, you can travel too; Ascend his topmast, through his piercing eyes Behold new countries in the distance rise: With sympathizing feeling, tread his deck, Or cling, in terror, to the midnight wreck! With kindred heart, you suffer all his woes, Share his escapes, his comforts, and repose. Thus may your fancy the great circuit roam, While (like a dial's index) safe at home. THE ZODIAC. Dear JuliaâPhilosophers gravely assert That our beautiful world is a spherule of dirt, That rolls, in a circuit, through regions of space, And passes, each year, through the very same place; That while it turns over, by day or by night, We scarcely know whether we're standing upright; But, yet, that our love for it sticks us so fast, We can not fall offâbut adhere to the last. The truth of such doctrine I will not dispute, Because I'm engaged in another pursuit; Besides, since I first crept about this machine, Such queer topsy-turvy manÅuvres I've seen, That twenty to one (as the learned have said) But mortals are, half the time, heels over head. Yet, still, as a poet, you known, I am bound To believe that the sun always travels around The turnpike of heaven, in chariot of fire, Drawn rapidly onward by steeds that ne'er tire, Nor stop to refresh, though they pass, as they fly, The signs of a dozen fine inns, in the sky. When last I addressed you, this bright charioteer Was galloping on in his brilliant career, The steeds from their nostrils still vomiting flame, As past the next stage-house they rapidly came. Poor PhÅbus in vain might have thirsted for wine, For nothing but water appeared on the sign: So onward he drove in the bright, starry zone, And left the cold, cheerless Aquarius alone. The scaly star, Pisces, soon greeted his eye, His old stopping-place, if the ancients do n't lie, Who counted this stage as the last on his route, Its sign is so temptingâa fine salmon trout. But soon the fierce steeds left it far in the rear, For another, that promised some mutton, was near; That Ram which had once a fair rider upon 't, And let her fall plump in the famed Hellespont; The crooked-horn Aries, whose rich golden fleece Was carried by Jason, in triumph, to Greece, Was the sign that invited the driver to bait, But nothing, it seems, could induce him to wait; A crack of his whip, and the mettlesome steeds Start forward like lightning, while Aries recedes. But PhÅbus, 't is said, when he saw the next sign, Was almost determined to stop and to dine; For the golden-horned Bull, which so gallantly bore The lovely Europa to Crete's happy shore, Invitingly promised, for hunger's relief, A fine, smoking sirloin of English roast beef. Apollo, however, regardless of inns, Drove onward, nor even accosted the Twins, Those famous Tyndarian brothers, that dwell, By changes alternate, in heaven or hell; The comrades of Jason in winning the fleece, Whose smiles, it is said, lull the tempest to peace, If sailors sincerely their favors invoke, To save from the wreck which the billows have broke. Behind were the Crab and the Lion afar, As well as the Virgin, Erigone's star; Astrea's bright balance now glowed on his sight, It trembledâhe threw in a handful of light, And finding the darkness just equalled the day, He whipped up his horses, and posted away. The Scorpion and Centaur he rapidly passed, And Pan, his old friend, he saluted at last; For his steeds, at the moment these verses were wrote, Were galloping up to the sign of the Goat. In pure, native English, your minstrel would say, That another New Year is commencing to-day. Dear, Julia, may blessings attend its return, While life's little taper continues to burn; And then, when the last welcome summons you hear, May you wake to a happy, thrice happy New Year. THE SEASONS. Juliaâeach season of the changeful year, In every stage of fleeting Time's career, Comes with a wreath of joy around it thrown, Some bliss, peculiar to itself alone; For Heaven, throughout creation's wondrous plan, Has had but one endâthe happiness of man. Pregnant with buds and flowers, the Spring appears, Like a young bride, arrayed in smiles and tears; Then sweetest odors float on every breeze, And new-made liveries clothe the sturdy trees; Each bush and shrub a verdant garb assumes, The apple blossoms, and the lilac blooms; A thousand flowerets in the meadow spring, And feathered choirs their grateful anthems sing; While valleys, hills, and woods, in rich array, Hail, with delight the bright return of May. Then Summer comes, the noontide of the year, When the sun gallops in his full career; She comesâher brows with yellow wheat-ears crowned, Her laughing face by heat and toil embrowned; She comes with full and bounteous hand to bring All that was promised by the hopeful Spring. 'T is then the long-protracted, sultry day, Perfects the embryon blossoms on each spray; Bids the young fruit with richest juices teem, And blush and ripen in the solar beam; Then scarlet strawberries court the eager taste, And luscious melons yield a sweet repast; While nectarious berries of each varied dye, On every bush and bramble greet the eye. Next, temperate Autumn comes upon the stage, The sober mean 'twixt vigorous youth and age; The evening twilight of the fading year, When objects all in mellowest tints appear; When feathered songster cease their tuneful notes, And liveried groves appear with yellow coats; The fruit-trees then, with golden burdens bend, And clustering grapes from shadowy vines impend; Pomona's treasures lie in heaps around, Scattered in rich profusion on the ground; From juicy apples, tortured in the mill, Sweet streams of grateful beverage distil; While ponderous wagons every field displays, Groaning beneath their loads of ripened maize. Winter succeeds, with snow-wreaths on his browâ Julia, I feel his icy fingers now! Winter succeedsâthe midnight of the year, And all the fields are barren, cold, and drear; He binds the streams and lakes in silver chains, And hoary frost has candied all the plains; The liveried trees their yellow coats forego, And shivering stand, in shrouds of frozen snow; While the chilled sap leaves succorless the shoot, And shrinks below, to cheer the dying root. Nor is stern Winter's icy sceptre swayed O'er sylvan scenes aloneâhis shafts invade Our splendid city, tooâand every street Is rendered cheerless by his pointed sleet; For every arrow from the centaur's bow, Is tipped with ice, and feathered, too, with snow. The Battery, now, each verdant charm has lost, And e'en the Park is silvered o'er with frost; Vauxhall and Castle-Garden, late so gay, Where night gave place to artificial day, Are now desertedâeven Chatham mourns, And all must droop till gentle Spring returns. But still, amid his tempest's rude alarms, Still Winter brings his own redeeming charms; Pleasures to no preceding season known, Delights peculiar to himself alone. His gelid breath (a healthful vapor, which Screws up this living lyre to concert-pitch) Enriches every fluid, and preserves An equal tension of the chords and nerves. Elastic as the air, our spirits soar, By heat and languor now depressed no more; While health and vigor wanton through our veins, And drive each azure demon from the brains. But that blest space between the day and night, A winter's evening, give the most delight; Sacred to friendship, love, and social mirth, When kindred souls surround the blazing hearth, Where wine, and wit, and sentiment abound, And modest jests and repartees go round. Or if the same domestic, happy group, Adjourn to hear our new Italian troupe; This epistle was written on Christmas Eve, 1825. Or gaze intensely on the tragic scene, When Conway, Cooper, Hamblin, Booth, or Kean, Pours a bright flood of wonder o'er their minds, And in his train the captive stranger binds;â Whether they join in laughing with the pit, At Barnes's humor, or at Hilson's wit; Tremble at base Iago's cruel hate, Or mourn for lovely Belvidera's fate; Or weep, at Chatham, for poor Blanche's grief, Inflicted by Clan Alpine's desperate chief; And then, in pleased and breathless silence, hear The requiem chanted o'er his silent bier; Or with the brave Fitz-James, admiring view, Fair Ellen guide her little frail canoe; Or view the Ethiop, from the Turkish tomb, Rise like a troubled spirit through the gloom; Or should they mingle in the mazy dance, Where hearts bound quick at beauty's tender glance, 'T is still domestic bliss, where'er they roam, For every place, to kindred hearts, is home. But Winter's brightest joy, in towns like this, Is yet unsungâI mean that scene of bliss To which our annual holydays give birth, A foretaste of elysium here on earth! That period to generous hearts so dear, That little week of joy that shuts the year, And brings to light the bright auspicious morn, When all unite to hail a New Year born! In all my wanderings through this vale of tears, From infancy, to manhood's riper years, Whatever pains assailed, or griefs oppressed, Christmas and New Year always saw me blest! A lengthened absence o'er, how pleasant, then, The friends I dearest love to meet again! Grasp the warm hand, or share the fond embrace, And see new smiles lit up in every face! 'T was Christmas eve! the supper board was spread, The fire blazed high, with logs of hickory fed; The candles, too, unusual lustre lent, Candles expressly made for this event. Old tales were told, the cheerful glass went round, While peals of laughter made the cot resound, A thousand welcomes hailed the truant boy, And swift the moments flew on wings of joy; Till (as they thought, too soon) the hour of prayer Bade the young urchins to their beds repair. But first the stocking, from each little leg, Must be suspended to a hook or peg, That Santa Claus, who travels all the night, Might, in the dark, bestow his favors right; These rites observed, they take a parting kiss, And go to dream of morning's promised bliss! Thus did a week of festive pleasures roll, Till New Year's happy morning crowned the whole. But though long past are days and joys so dear, Others as sweet still crown each fleeting year; E'en brighter pleasures, now, 't is mine to prove, In Julia's friendship, and my Lydia's love. While our gay prattlers, innocent as young, Re-act the drama here so coldly sung, Accept this token of my pure regard, The Seasons, sung by an immortal bard, The peerless Thompson; hear his rural strains, And you'll forget that blustering winter reigns; Accept this tribute of a heart sincere, And be you happy many a future year. THE FIREMAN, SPOKEN BY MRS. DUFF, FOR THE FIREMEN'S BENEFIT, JANUARY 24, 1827. Hoarse wintry blasts a solemn requiem sung To the departed dayâupon whose bier The velvet pall of midnight had been flung, And nature mourned through one wide hemisphere. Silence and darkness held their cheerless sway, Save in the haunts of riotous excess; And half the world in dreamy slumbers lay, Lost in the maze of sweet forgetfulness. When lo! upon the startled ear There broke a sound, so dread and drear, As, like a sudden peal of thunder, Burst the bands of sleep asunder, And filled a thousand throbbing hearts with fear. Hark! the faithful watchman's cry Speaks a conflagration nigh! See! you glow upon the sky Confirms the fearful tale! The deep-mouthed bells, with rapid tone, Combine to make the tidings known; Affrighted silence now has flown. And sound of terror freight the chilly gale! At the first note of this discordant din, The gallant Fireman from his slumber starts, Reckless of toil or danger, if he win The tributary meed of grateful hearts. From pavement rough, or frozen ground, His engine's rattling wheels resound, And soon, before his eyes, The lurid flames, with horrid glare, Mingled with murky vapor, rise In wreathy folds, upon the air, And veil the frowning skies! Sudden, a shriek assails his heart! A female shriek! so piercing wild As makes his very life-blood startâ âMy child!âAlmighty God!âMy child!â He hearsâand 'gainst the tottering wall The ponderous ladder rears, While blazing fragments round him fall, And crackling sounds assail his ears! His sinewy arm, with one rude crash, Hurls to the earth the opposing sash, And, heedless of the startling din, Though smoky volumes round him roll, The mother's shriek has pierced his soul! See!âSee!âHe plunges in! The admiring crowd, with hopes and fears, In breathless expectation stand! When lo! the daring youth appears, Hailed by a burst of warm, ecstatic cheers, Bearing the child, triumphant, in his hand! NEW YORK. Hail! happy city! where the arts convene And busy commerce animates the scene; Where taste, and elegance, with wealth combine, To perfect art, in every bright design; Where splendid mansions that attract the eye, Can boast, what opulence could never buy, The generous wish that springs to Virtue's goal, The liberal mind, the high, aspiring soul; The freeborn wish that warms the patriot's breast, The chaste refinements that make beauty blest: These are the charms that give Industry, here, A pleasing relish, and a hope sincere; And while they bid the sighs of anguish cease, Strew Labor's pillow with the flowers of peace. When the sad exile, freed from ocean's storm, First treads our shore, what hopes his bosom warm! For welcome meets him with an honest smile, And kind attentions every care beguile. No dread of tyrants here his peace annoys, No fears of fetters mar his bosom's joys; No dark suspicions on his steps attend, He only needs one, here, to find a friend; He finds, at once, a refuge and a home, Nor longer mourns the cause that bade him roam. Where'er he turns, on every side are traced The marks of genius, and enlightened taste; He sees in every portico and dome, The architectural grace of Greece and Rome; And finds, in our unrivalled promenades, Charms that may vie with Athen's classic shades. That rural scene that skirts the loveliest bay That ever sparkled in the solar ray; Where the rude engines of relentless Mars, Once frowned, in ranks, beneath Columbia's stars, But which have since for ever yielded place To fashion, beauty, elegance, and graceâ That lovely scene first greets the wanderer's eye, And cheats his bosom of a passing sigh, So like some spots upon his native shore, By him, perhaps, to be enjoyed no more! On either hand, a mighty river glides, Which here, at length, unite and mingle tides, Like some fond pair, affianced in the skies, Whose forms, as yet, ne'er met each other's eyes, When the auspicious fated moment rolls, They meetâthey loveâunite, and mingle souls. Magnific piles, the monuments of art, And lofty spires, adorn this splendid mart, Where Piety erects her sacred shrine, And pays her homage to the power divine; Where heaven-born âgenius wings his eagle flight, Rich dew-drops shaking from his wings of light;â Where Science opens wide his boundless store Of classic sweets and antiquated lore; Where freedom, virtue, knowledge, all unite To make the scene an Eden of delight; While pulpit, press, and bar, are all combined To mend the heart, and elevate the mind. Nor do these mighty engines toil alone, By other hands the seeds of taste are sown. The Drama opes its bright, instructive scenes; Its object useâamusement but the means: For though the muse resort to fiction's aid, Fiction is here, but truth in masquerade, And thousands, who her grave entreaties shun, Are, by her borrowed smiles, allured and won. YALE COLLEGE. Access is mine, the willing gates unfold, And Yale's assembled sons mine eyes behold; Our future statesmen, patriots, bards, divines, For whom bright Fame the fadeless laurel twines, And here convened, and in each youthful face Their rising greatness fancy fain would trace. Say, are not here some souls that restless burn, On life's great stage to take an active turn; To rise, the awful pillars of the state, And rival ancient Tully in debate? Some who possess a portion of that flame That gained our Washington immortal fame? Others, whose philanthropic bosoms glow To act like Franklin in relieving wo? Whose philosophic souls his fame inspires To wield the thunder and direct its fires; To soar, on Fancy's wing, through trackless space, View countless orbs and all their movements trace, Governed by order and unchanging laws, And in effects behold the eternal cause? Some glowing with a Homer's living fire, Designed to âwake to ecstasy the lyre,â To bid Columbia's future fame arise, And rear Parnassus under western skies; Here fix the temple of the tuneful throng, And rival Albion's boasted sons of song? Or are not here some destined yet to shine, With cloudless lustre, in the desk divine; To wake the soul, and guide its feeble view To Him who made, and can its form renew; Recall the wandering wretch, his course restrain, And gently lead him to the fold again; Arouse the careless, and support the weak, And gospel truths with voice unfaltering speak? Hail, sons of Genius! youthful sages, hail! The glory, pride, support, and boast of Yale; Your country's ornaments aspire to prove, And grace the spheres in which you're called to move; So shall your Alma Mater rise in fame, And deathless honors decorate her name. And here the muse bewails her hapless bard, Whose cruel fate such golden prospects marred, For Hope once whispered to his ardent breast, âThy dearest, fondest wish shall be possessedââ Unfolded to his view the classic page, And all its treasures promised ripening age; Showed Learning's flowery path which led to Fame, Whose distant temple glittered with his name. Illusive all!âthe phantom all believe, Though still we know her promises deceive; Chill penury convinced the wretch too late, Her words were false, and his a hapless fate. TO MRS. MARY WORTHINGTON MORRIS, (THE AMIABLE AND BELOVED WIFE OF MY MUCH ESTEEMED FRIEND AND BROTHER-POET GEORGE P. MORRIS.) The seer of old, whose name I bear, The prophet who anointed Saul, Predicted many a bright affair To grace the rising chief withal: So I, once gazing on a youth, From boyhood just emerging, With genius, talent, virtue, truth, To acts of greatness urgingâ Predicted that an angel's hand, Would lead him to the promised land. Years rolled away, and Fame was his, With blessings of the wise and good; And while o'er Hope's sad obsequies Thousands as drooping mourners stood, He smiled in triumphâfor success With liberal hand had crowned him; And Beauty's smile, with Love's caress, In silken cords had bound him. I saw the angel at his sideâ 'Twas thouâhis counsellor and guide. New York, May 20th, 1833. MORNING. The morn, in purple glories bright, Now burst upon the rear of Night, Who, gathering up his lurid vest, Is swift retreating towards the west. All nature wakes from soft repose, The flowers their dewy breasts unclose, Where insect tribes their votaries pay, And sip their nectared sweets away. The birds commence their matin song, And streams of music float along: The herds their grassy couch forsake, To crop the mead, or taste the lake, And all commence the infant day, As toil or pleasure points the way. TO ARTHUR KEENE THE VOCALIST. The minstrel of Erin, who charmed us before, Returns from the warm, sunny isles, Again on the pure air of Freedom to pour The strain which elicits her smiles. A freeman must cherish its witchery long, Though years have been wasted between; When erst he awakened dear liberty's song, The thrill of our rapture was keen; The current of feeling rolled sweetly along, And its thrill was delightfully keen. He comes from the rich spicy isles of the West, Unrivalled in science and tone, And warmly is greeted by those who caressed, When first his enchantments were known. Again will he waken his magical lyre, Again cast a spell o'er the scene, Till hearts long dejected will kindle with fire, And confess that the rapture is keen. Oh, his are the tones which can feeling inspire, And its thrill is delightfully keen. THREE IMPROMPTUS ON THE ROOM IN WHICH SHAKESPEARE WAS BORN. Here wast thou born! Immortal Shakespeare! here! âNo matter where!ââthy fame is just as dear To freemen on the mighty Hudson's side As where the Avon's crystal waters glide:â No town, no realm, no hemisphere can claim A bard like thee, of universal fame!â As ancient Bethlehem had sure blasphemed, To claim the glory of a world redeemed! This little room the place of Shakespeare's birth! Of him whose deathless glory fills the earth! Perish the fiction!âthat immortal mind, By walls nor limits could not be confined:â 'T was born in Heaven, and merely paused awhile, To take a robe of flesh from Britain's isle. Born in this room!âthat I deny:â I'd life and honor pawn, That one like him, who can not die, Could never have been born! CRITICS. Who seeks for spots in Sol, must gaze Through mediums that obstruct his rays; So jealous envy's jaundiced eye, Hides beauties, trivial faults to spy. We own our work has some defects, 'Tis what each candid mind expects; But has it marks of taste and talents? In mercy let that strike the balance. TO MRS. ? ON HER EMBARKING FOR HAVRE. Lady, we partâI do not say farewell! So cold a word my heart will not allow; 'Tis breathed too often when no bosoms swell With such emotions as oppress me now; For I remember well when first we met, And note the years we since have seen depart, By acts of kindness I can ne'er forget, Graved deeply on the tablets of my heart. This monitor ne'er sleeps; but I've another, Who hourly breathes her grateful prayers for thee; For kindness to my childrenâit is their mother, Whose blessings will attend thee on the sea. She prays to Him who stilled the boisterous wave Of Galilee, and hushed the tempest wild; She prays that His kind providence may save The widowed mother and her darling child. Lady, we partâand here thy friends are doomed To mourn in tears thy absence for awhile; But not with hopeless grief, for 't is presumed, A happy meeting yet will light our smile. Go, then, where love invites theeâGallia fair, Land of the vine and sweet perennial flowers; Thy children's fond embrace awaits thee there; Receive them, then, and fly again to ours. No prayers can shield thee from each treach'rous gale, Or were this trifle blest with magic power, Thy venturous bark should have a prosperous sail, While memory wakened every lonely hourâ Recalling thoughts with us again to dwell, When rough old ocean turbulently ravesâ With us who feel, but can not say farewell! To those we love upon the stormy wave. TO MY FRIEND, MR. E. PARMLY, ON THE MORNING OF HIS DEPARTURE FOR EUROPE, JULY 8TH, 1824. When, on ebon car advancing, Mellow eve resumes her sway, While on rippling waters dancing, Brightly sparkles Cynthia's ray, Freed from languid day's dominion, Hearts are light, Eyes are bright, Music playing, Zephyrs straying, Fan the groves with balmy pinion; Then will I remember thee, Wilt thou, then, too, think of me? When through sheets of fleecy vapor, Glows the zenith's starry dome; When the glow-worm lights her taper, To allure her rover home; While pale Avarice counts his treasure, Lovers meet, Moments sweet, Vows renewing, Doubts subduing, 'T is the hour of purest pleasure; Then will I remember thee, Then bestow one thought on me. TO THEODORE S. FAY, ON HIS DEPARTURE FOR EUROPE. The sails are unfurled, and the anchor apeak, The pilot is now at the wheel, Adieu! we must lose thee! but words are too weak To express the emotions we feel! May fresh western breezes, propitiously fair, Thy gallant bark safely propel, While we will invoke, in each soul-breathing prayer, A blessing upon theeâfarewell! Far, far from thy home, and from liberty's clime, To the land of the graces you hie, Where vales of enchantment, and mountains sublime, Delight and astonish the eye. Where genius and taste, and the sweetest of arts, In classical beauty excel; But ah! wilt thou find such affectionate hearts As those which now bid theeâfarewell! Then, music and love, to the light-flitting hours, The plumage of paradise lend; And, sporting with beauty in balm-breathing bowers, Will smilingly welcome our friend. But ah! can their witcheries ever impart A joy like the conjugal spell, Which she, who attends thee, has laid on thy heart? We know that heart betterâfarewell! For her, and for thee, we shall blessings invoke, And if storms on the ocean assail, May He, who to Galilee's billows once spoke, Soon silence the voice of the gale. And roseate health, as she lights up the cheek, Each care from your hearts shall dispel; And, oh! when possessed of the blessing you seek, Return to our bosomâfarewell! THE PAST. How fleet is time!âthe little recent year Seems like a moment that was scarcely here Before 't was wasted! Time still onward flies, Swift as a swallow seems to cleave the skies; Laughing at those who, indolently blind, Seized not his forelockâhe is bald behind! The past! what is it but a faded dream Of promised joys? A bubble on the stream Which flows unceasing to a shoreless sea, The boundless ocean of eternity! The past! where is it? In the Eternal mind It still exists, to all the future joined, In one vast panorama! Mortal eye Sees but the present, as it passes by! The past! why is it that it leaves behind So sad a legacy to all mankind? Memory looks back with vain regrets and tears While lingering o'er the urn of wasted years. The past! how is it that we don't improve From these instructive pictures as they move? Precept!âexperience!âhow can man demur? âBe wise to-dayâ't is madness to defer!â Thus mourn the humble, with the grave in viewâ Thus teach the wiseâand what they teach is true. But hope, sweet hope, illusive hope, still smiles, Points to the futureâflatters and beguiles; All trust her treacherous promises too far, The bubble bursts!âand we areâwhat we are! THE MINSTREL'S FAREWELL TO HIS LYRE. When Fate's stern fiat dooms fond friends to part, What thrilling pangs pervade the feeling heart! With ardent glow the proffered hand is pressed, While the moist eye bespeaks the aching breast; The final gaze, we, lingering still renew, Dreading the last, the painful wordâAdieu! So Iâa bird of passageâwont to roveâ Have oft been doomed to leave the friends I love; Have oft been fated to endure the smart Which now afflicts my lacerated heart; That heart alive to every finer glow, Enrapturing joyâor ecstacy of wo. Then, friends of song, attend your Minstrel's lay, He sings but this, and throws his lyre away. In life's fair morn, when sunshine warmed the scene, And fairy hopes danced o'er the laughing green, His infant Muse essayed the artless strain, On Charles's bank, or Newton's verdant plain; Gave him her lyre, and taught his hand to play, While flattering Echo chanted back the lay. Pleased like a child, he fondly thought 't was Fame, Ambition kindled, and he sought the dame; Unknowing where her lofty temple stood, He pierced the grotto and explored the wood; But vain the search, in meadow, vale, or hill, The air-formed phantom flew, but answered still, Till tired Experience proved the sylvan scene Held not the temple of ambition's queen. With fond regret he left the calm retreat, Where Nature's charms in sweet disorder meet, Diversified with meadows, groves, and hills, And Charles's thousand tributary rillsâ Left rustic joys, to court the city's smile, And woke the strain in Beauty's cause awhile. He sang of loveâa minstrel's sweetest dream, And sang sincerelyâfor he felt the theme; His soul was poured in every amorous toneâ An angel heard, and answered with her own. Columbia calledâto arms her veterans sprang, He felt the impulse, and of glory sang; Swept o'er the chords, assumed a loftier lay, And vent'rous dared with bolder hand to play. But, ah! his harp no blooming laurel bears, His humble brow no blushing garland wears; Unknown, unsought, he must obscurely sigh, Held from despair but by affection's tie; By love and penury condemned to know, Like Leda's sons, alternate bliss and wo. Then Fame, adieu! no more he courts your charms; Welcome, Retirement! take him to your arms; Here, gentle Muse, he gives you back the lyre, Whose tones could once his youthful bosom fire. That lyre shall sleep, nor breathe a tone again, Till scenes celestial claim the glowing strain; Till realms eternal burst upon the view, And animate the wondering bard anew. Till then, farewell! He follows Fame no more! But spurns the shrine at which he knelt beforeâ Let Poverty prepare her bitterest draught, And malice barb his most inveterate shaftâ The troubled dream of life will soon be o'er, And a bright morning dawn to fade no more.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vol. II. BALLADS AND HUMOROUS PIECES. THE HUNTERS OF KENTUCKY. Ye gentlemen and ladies fair, Who grace this famous city, Just listen, if ye've time to spare, While I rehearse a ditty; And for the opportunity, Conceive yourselves quite lucky, For 't is not often that you see, A hunter from Kentucky. Oh! Kentucky, the hunters of Kentucky, The hunters of Kentucky. We are a hardy free-born race, Each man to fear a stranger, Whate'er the game, we join in chase, Despising toil and danger; And if a daring foe annoys, Whate'er his strength and forces, We'll show him that Kentucky boys Are âalligator horses.â Oh! Kentucky, &amp;c. I s'pose you 've read it in the prints, How Packenham attempted To make Old Hickory Jackson wince, But soon his scheme repented; For we with rifles ready cocked, Thought such occasion lucky, And soon around the general flocked The hunters of Kentucky. Oh! Kentucky, &amp;c. You 've heard, I s'pose, how New Orleans Is famed for wealth and beautyâ There 's girls of every hue, it seems, From snowy white to sooty: So Packenham he made his brags, If he in fight was lucky, He 'd have their girls and cotton bags, In spite of Old Kentucky. Oh! Kentucky, &amp;c. But Jackson, he was wide awake, And was n't scared at trifles; For well he knew what aim we take, With our Kentucky rifles; So he led us down to Cypress swamp, The ground was low and mucky; There stood John Bull, in martial pomp, And here was Old Kentucky. Oh! Kentucky, &amp;c. A bank was raised to hide our breast, Not that we thought of dying, But then we always like to rest, Unless the game is flying; Behind it stood our little forceâ None wished it to be greater, For every man was half a horse, And half an alligator. Oh! Kentucky, &amp;c. They did not let our patience tire, Before they showed their facesâ We did not choose to waste our fire, So snugly kept our places; But when so near we saw them wink, We thought it time to stop them; And 't would have done you good, I think. To see Kentucky pop them. Oh! Kentucky, &amp;c. They found at last, 't was vain to fight Where lead was all their booty, And so they wisely took to flight, And left us all the beauty. And now, if danger e'er annoys, Remember what our trade is, Just send for us Kentucky boys, And we'll protect you, ladies. Oh! Kentucky, the hunters of Kentucky, The hunters of Kentucky. THE WATERMAN. Let philosophers boast of their learning and skill, And tell us what sages have thought o' men; It yet is a fact, sirs, deny it who will, Human nature's the study for watermen. For ours is the talent to soon put afloat All ages, professions, and sizes; From the sweep's sooty rug to the gaudy laced coat, As the grade to the general rises. While we row, To and fro, One way look, the other go.

While each freeman's son Boasts of rights in plenty, Daughters have but one, E'en at one-and-twenty: 'T is the right to choose Whom we mean to marry, And, at once, refuse Tom, or Dick, or Harry; 'T is our chartered right, Nature's hand has penned it, Let us then unite Bravely to defend it. While our fathers fought For our independence, Patriot mothers taught This to their descendants:â Daughters guard and save Rights too dear to barter, Spurn the name of slave, Freedom is your charter. You 've the right to choose Whom you mean to marry, Whom you will refuse, Tom, or Dick, or Harry. Men may boast the bliss Of a free election, Women ask but this, Uncontrolled affection; Then we cheerly say, Tutored by the pastor, âHonor, love, obey,â To our lord and master. Daughters, guard and save Rights too dear to barter, Spurn the name of slave, Freedom is our charter. There 's a claim more strong Than a sire's or brother's; If they think us wrong, Let them ask our mothers: When they played their parts, Urged by love and beauty, With their hands and hearts They transferred their duty. 'T is our chartered right, Nature's hand has penned it, Let us then unite Bravely to defend it. WILLIAM'S PROMOTION. The drum had ceased, the bugle slept, The sentry marched with footsteps wary, When ditch and picket William leapt, Eager to see his wedded Mary. But ah! his colonel, just before, On her defenceless state presuming, Had entered Mary's cottage door, The husband's voice and dress assuming. Soft and sly, Mary fled; William's eye soothed her dread. âIlls infernal seize the colonel!â Cried he, unwary. But Mary suggested, that he be arrested, And as a deserter to camp returned; And William, who with resentment burn'd, Commends the thought, and soon is brought A brisk sergeant's guard; the colonel pleads hard, But his disguise deceives all eyes; He swears and cries, while none replies; Safely guarded, not retarded, William sees him borne from Mary; Faithful Mary, beautiful Mary, Dear little, sweet little, constant Mary. The morning came, the reveille beat, The troops paraded bright and airy, And there, in regimentals neat, William had brought his lovely Mary. The colonel, now restored to rank, Around on milk-white charger prances, Until his eye, upon the flank, Is caught by blushing Mary's glances. Soon he asks, who was mad, to enlist such a lad; William ready, answered steady, Bright, brisk, and airy: âThe youth I recruited, I hope you are suited, For though he is young, and tender, and light, He took a deserter, sir, last night; Though dark and damp, some way from camp The villian was caught, and hither brought, In deep disguise.â The colonel's eyes Betray surpriseâat length he cries, âBe it notedâyou 're promoted Ensignâever guard your Mary; Faithful Mary, beautiful Mary, Dear little, sweet little, constant Mary.â DOCTOR STRAMONIUM. A last and a lapstone, were once my delight, And I sung while I hammered, from morning till night; But all the day's earnings, at eve, I would spend, Till the thread of my credit was brought to an end. SPOKEN. For I was up to a thing or two, and loved fun; passed the night in reciting Shakespeare at the alehouse, and kept myself awake the next day, by beating time with the hammer, while I sungâ Make a death, cut a stick, high time I tramped, Rise again, tick again, credit new vamped. I next taught the gamut, the sharps, and the flats, To a nasal-twanged bass, and a treble of cats; Till my private duett with a miss, got abroad, Which changed the key note, and produced a discord. SPOKEN. A little love affair, that ran counter to my wishes, and induced some slanderous tongues to pronounce the whole tenor of my conduct to be thorough bass. So, without venturing a da capo, I pocketed the slur, leapt the bar with a quick movement, and left the flats to harmonize as they could; for all the gossips had decreed that their daughters should have nothing more to do with my Fa, sol, la; fa, sol, la; fa, sol, la, me; Hop a twig, such a rig ought not to be. A travelling merchant I quickly became, With a new stock in trade, a new dress, and new name; And I bartered my goods with such exquisite grace, That I left a fair mourner in every place. SPOKEN. âO Tabitha, what will become of me! The dear, sweet Mr. Rover (for that was my travelling name), my dear, sweet Mr. Rover, the pedler, is gone, and perhaps I shall never see him again. Oh, dear?âââYour dear, sweet Mr. Rover, indeed? I'd have you to know, Cousin Keziah, that he is my dear, sweet Mr. Rover, and he has left me something to remember him by.âââOh, the base wicked deceiver! He has left me something too.â Thus would they sympathize with each other, or tear caps for poor Rover, while I was unconsciously preparing a similar mine to spring in the next village; or jogging quietly along the road inviting every one to buy my Dutch ovens, cullenders, dippers and pans, Broaches and buckles, with ear-rings and fans. A schoolmaster, next, with a visage severe, Board, lodging, and washing, and twelve pounds a year, For teaching the rustics to spell, and to read The New England Primer, the Psalter, and Creed. SPOKEN. You must know, that I undertook to hammer a little learning through the calfskined pates of seventy or eighty square-toed, leather-headed numskulls. But after vainly trying the experiment at both ends of the patients, I lost my own patience, and my school into the bargain, and was glad to make a precipitate retreat with a whole skin; and this so forcibly reminded me of my musical scrape, that I struck up the old chorus of Fa, sol, la; fa, sol, la; fa, sol, la, me; Hop a twig, such a rig ought not to be. I then became preacher without any call, When a sweet village lass came to hear brother Paul; And told her experience o'er with such grace, That I gave the dear creature an ardent embrace. SPOKEN. There was the devil to pay, and poor I once more in the vocative. But I made my escape to the backwoods, singing my old Crispin dittyâ Make a death, cut a stick, high time I tramped, Rise again, tick again, credit new vamped. And now a physician, with cocked hat and wig, I can feel ladies' pulses, look wise, and talk big; With a fine ruffled shirt, and good coat to my back, I pluck the poor geese, while the ducks exclaim quack! SPOKEN. âOh, doctor, I am so glad you are come. I have such a consarned beating of the heart, that I can hardly draw my breath. Oh!âââLet me see your tongue, miss.âââMy tongue! Law souls, doctor, what in the world has the tongue to do with the heart?âââIn general, miss, not much; but your case is an exception.âââAn exception! Oh, goody gracious! now you don't say so; is an exception a dangerous disorder, doctor?âââNot at all dangerous, miss. An application of stramonium externally, and copious draughts of catnip tea internally, will soon restore you.â The lady's heart becomes composed, I pocket my fee, and make my exit, singingâ Feel the pulse, smell the cane, look at the tongue, Touch the gold, praise the old, flatter the young. TO BELINDA. Oh, those eyes! but that right eye in particular! Billy Lackaday. Those auburn tresses sweetly play, Around that pearly neck so fair, And sweetly does that brow display The clustering ringlets slumbering there. Not sea-born Venus, famed of old, With streaming locks, like threads of gold, Sparkling with ocean's liquid brightness, Could boast of graces so divine, As those bewitching locks of thine, Which shade thy forehead's sunny whiteness. The softest shade of Tyrian dye, Could never with that cheek compare; Nor will the bright carnation vie In color, with thy lip, my fair. What though Cashmere's delightful vale, With balmy odor freights the gale At every fragrant feast of roses, Its charms are hereâwhy farther seek? Its tints are blooming on thy cheek, Its fragrance on thy lip reposes. That lip, so like the bow of love, In graceful curvature and hue, And there 's a dimple just above, A quiver for his arrows, too, That sacred shrine of nameless charms, That faultless shape, those graceful arms, That peerless elegance of motion; With richer beauties of the mind, Allâall, in one dear form combined, May well inspire this heart's devotion. But oh, that eye, that beaming eye, Mild as the softest star of even, Clear as the azure of the sky, Bright as the vesper lamp of heaven! Whence was that orb of beauty stole, Whose matchless lustre, in my soul Has lit a flame no power can smother! âWhich?â asked the fairââI'm clear of theftâ These sixteen years I 've owned the left, And pa paid Scudder for the other.â THE FEMALE INVINCIBLES. When Love's reveille summons matron and maid, Julia Ann is the first to appear on parade; Ever ready at roll-call, with weapon in hand, To advance, wheel, and halt, at the word of command. With a passing salute, and we march in review, To the rub-a-dub-dub and the rat-tat-too! SPOKEN. Attention, company!âRight, dress!âSupport, arms!âBy platoons, right wheelâForward, guide left, march! With a passing salute as we march in review, To the rub-a-dub-dub and the rat-tat-too! For conquest prepared, yet determined to yield, Fair Therese and Sophia are the next in the field; Where they gayly manÅuvre their bright polished charms, Waiting Hymen's command for presenting their arms. With a passing salute as we march in review, To the rub-a-dub-dub and the rat-tat-too! SPOKEN. Halt!âReady!âAim!âAs you were!âBy the right flank, file left!âmarch! With a passing salute as we march in review, To the rub-a-dub-dub and the rat-tat-too! Well armed and equipped for a trial of skill, Fair Eliza and Jane next appear at the drill; Though reckless of danger, they'll face any man, Yet their fire often proves but a flash in the pan. With a passing salute as we march in review, To the rub-a-dub-dub and the rat-tat-too! SPOKEN. On right, file into line!âRear rank, open order, march!â Present, arms!âCarry, arms!âClose order!âRight face, march! âRecover, arms! With a passing salute as we march in review, With the rub-a-dub-dub and the rat-tat-too! LIFE IN LONDON. Oh, in London there's fun done, so gayly and daily, There 's no one to blow one, you know, with a grace; For treating, and eating, and smoking, and joking, And drinking, and pinking, O London 's the place. Such dancing and prancing, and milling and billing, They scare away care away, are they not blest? Such rambling and gambling, of sinners and winners, Beginners make skinners as sharp as the best. Oh, in London there 's fun done, &amp;c. In London, if undone, by fun done, and run down, By bailiffs and califfs, with pitiless rage; A debtor can better (by shunning their dunning, With cunning or running) escape from the cage. Oh, in London there 's fun done, &amp;c. Such jarring and sparring, with Charlies no parleys, But mill away, kill away, as you 've been taught; While squaring and swearing, the fancy we can see, Delighting in fighting, for that is your sort. Oh, in London, there 's fun done, &amp;c. LIFE IN CLOVER. When cupid's dart first pierced my heart, Jane Spinster was my darling, Who kept for pets, two paroquettes, A monkey, and a starling. I asked the miss to grant a kiss, But met a scoff, that drove me off, And left the fair one snarling. I next beset a young coquette, For thirteen months or nearly, Who played her part, with so much art, I thought she loved me dearly. But when, at last, her hand I asked, She bade me know that such a beau, Was what she wanted yearly. A widow next my mind perplexed, For half a year or over, And like an ass, I hoped to pass My days with her in clover; I did, indeed, the fair agreed, And named the day, then ran away With Harry Blunt, the drover. But hang the past, I'm fixed at last, No more to be a ranger, The knot is tied, and I 've a bride, United past all danger. Now who but I in clover lie, The banquet 's mine, oh, how I'll dine, No mastiff in the manger. OH, WOMEN ARE ANGELS. Oh, women are angels, in limbs, In person, and manners, and features, But what shall we say of the whims, That govern these comical creatures? By turns they will fondle and teaseâ With what would you have me compare them? Though buzzing and stinging like bees, For the sake of the honey we bear them. Yet women are angels, you see, There's something so charming about them, Whatever their oddities be, Oh, we never could manage without them. There are some that resemble ice-cream, Which coldly forbids you to sip, sir; But however frosty it seem, It will melt with the warmth of your lip, sir. While others, like counterfeit grapes, The best imitations are hollow, With beautiful colors and shapes, But oh, they 're the devil to swallow. Yet women are angels, &amp;c. What strange contradictions they show, In matters of conjugal bliss, sir, While frowning and crying âno, no!â They wish you to take it for âyes, sir.â Pursue, and how swift they will fly, All panting with fears and alarms, sir, Retreatâand I'll bet you my eye, They'll pant, by-and-by, in your arms, sir. Yet women are angels, &amp;c. HUNGER AND AN EMPTY PURSE; OR, THE RUINED GAMBLER. Needs must, when the devil's driver, I must diddle, beg, or worse, For I 've not a single stiver To expel him from my purse. Once in the infernal regions, A gaming-house. Ere I met with luck's reverse, I could cleanly do the pigeons, Till I neatly filled my purse. Then among the swells and pippins, Who could âplay the devilâ worse, Till point âNon Plusâ saw me tripping, Not a penny in my purse. Poverty, they say 's an evil, Hunger, damme! that is worse, Both together are the devil, Hunger and an empty purse. When I dream of feasting, raking, Playing, winningâoh! the curse Of still finding here on waking, Hunger and an empty purse. Though I run when bailiffs rout me, Flying wont remove the curse, Still I bear my hell about me, Hunger and an empty purse. Jane, of lateâI 'd better staid offâ Treats me with neglect, or worse; But, perhaps, the girls afraid of Hunger and an empty purse. When the parson prays for sinners, He omits the deadliest curseâ âSave us from the want of dinners, Hunger, and an empty purse.â Doctors feel the pulse, we know, too, Often when they should feel thus, For we half our sickness owe to Hunger and an empty purse. While their patients make a die on 't, Lawyers oft are doing worse, Leaving many a hapless client Hunger and an empty purse. What but this infernal gnawing, When our lotteries make a fuss, Draws such crowds to see the drawing? Hunger and an empty purse. What 's the boasted inspiration, That creates the poet's verse, But the hope of compensation, Hunger and an empty purse. A FOURTH OF JULY CELEBRATION. Sung by Mr. Roberts at the Chatham Theatre, in 1825, in the character of a country boy. Where's Roberts, that red-headed fellow? I wanted to give him a call, sir; They told me down there in the cellar, I 'd find him up here in the hall, sir. I 've come from the country, you know, For farming is my occupation; To see what you city folks show On a fourth of July celebration. Umpti-uddity, &amp;c. To Hobok I rode in a wagon, And sailed over the river in style, sir; For the boat had a pole with a flag on, And a big pot of water to boil, sir. The stovepipe was smoking like fury, An iron thing bobbed up and down, sir, And all, just to make, I assure you, A wheel in the water go round, sir. We landed, at length, in your city, Without the least morsel of dread, sir, For I thought it a wonderful pity, If I could n't find the Bull's Head, sir. So I travelled right up to Broadway, Where gridirons are laid out in the street, sir, For wood is so scarce here, they say, The sun has to boil all the meat, sir. The people were thicker than mustard, Each girl with her beautiful lips, sir, Looked sweeter than honey or custard, And smiled like a basket of chips, sir; The windows were chuck full of gay things, And boys in every shop, sir, Were buying those little red playthings, That cracked away pop-ity pop! sir. The crowd it grew thicker and thicker, Along by the Park iron fence, sir, Where gingerbread, cherries, and liquor, Were spread upon tables in tents, sir. There was lobsters, and oysters, and clams, Green pease, new potatoes, and gravy, With pigs ready roasted, and hams, Enough to provision the navy. The Park was all crowded with people, And so was the big City-Hall, sir, Chuck full, from the steps to the steeple, The gallery, windows, and all, sir. They were waiting to see the procession, And sure enough, after a while, sir Mechanics of every profession, Formed a line that extended a mile, sir. And there was the veteran corps, Each member an old seventy-sixer, In the very same dress that he wore, When he peppered John Bull for his tricks, sir. Each man who had courage and pluck, And boasted political stamina, In his hat had the tail of a buck, In honor of Mister St. Tammany. And then came a beautiful ship, I'm sorry I could n't get near her; All handsomely rigged and equipped, With a neat little fellow to steer her. And there was a seven-foot Venus, As big as the wife of a giant, They said it was one Mrs. Genius, I mean to ask Halleck or Bryant. But don't let 's forget the brave fellows, Whose things at a fire never fail, sir, They work 'em all one like a bellows, And every one spouts like a whale, sir. All these, with a thousand more people, Marched off, for their edification, To a building without any steeple, To hear Hooper Cumming's oration. Then I heard such a fifing and drumming, I axed the folks what was to pay, sir, They told me the soldiers were coming, All marching along in Broadway, sir. And soon in the Park was paraded, The strength of our city, I'll bet, sir, With no other view, I'm persuaded, But to honor the brave Lafayette, sir. Then there was the famous balloon, That travels ten miles in a minute, Set out on a voyage to the moon, With a parley vous Francois man in it; Besides a boat-race on the water, Where one of them travelled so fast, sir, I wonder how t'other one caught her, Without e'er a sail or a mast, sir. So, having seen everything new, I thought I would finish the day, sir, By coming with Sally and Sue, And Ichabod, here to the play, sir. But if you should relish my song, I'll make you another and bring it; Much better, because not so long, And red-headed Roberts shall sing it. BARNEY BROOKE AND BETSEY BAKER. âIf ye have tears prepare to shed them now.â Mr. Barney Brooke courted Betsey Baker, She a pastry cook, he an undertaker; Those who ate her tarts, pies, and sillabubs, sir, Called her queen of hearts, at their festal clubs, sir. Barney thus began, âBetsey, I adore you, Before another man, take the man before you; I 've a thriving trade, doctors are so plenty; Graves must still be madeâmaids are grave at twenty.â With a saucy look, quick she answered Barney: âMr. Barney Brooke, I will not brook your blarney; I make pies and tarts; you 've a different trade, sir; Shall the queen of hearts, take the jack of spades sir.â He in silence sighed, while she stirred her batter, âSpeak!â at length she cried, ânever mince the matter.â Barney answered grave, while his brow was clouded, âGrant the boon I crave, else my hopes are shrouded.â Barney wooed in vain, Betsey mocked his passion, Ridiculed his painâjilting was the fashion; The undertaker died, by sorrow overtaken; Dr. Smoken tried, but could n't save his bacon. Soon the pastry cook found her roses wilting, Because she jilted Brooke, who could not brook her jilting; Fast her health did waste, pies no more she heeded, Nor could she knead her paste, although her paste was needed. Twelve o'clock at night found the maid a weeping, When an awful sight set her blood a creeping; Hid beneath the rug, soon she heard this sentence: âBet, your grave is dug, spite of your repentance!â Betty's spirit fled where it ought to go, sir, Apes, they say, are led somewhere down below, sir. Then, pastry cooks beware! Ne'er jilt an undertaker, Or you may chance to share the fate of Betsey Baker. THE RECONCILATION. And did I leave her then in anger! Resentment never touch her heartâ 'T was agitation, sorrow, languor, And I a wretch could thus depart! Now, she 's in tearsâher heart is broken! And she will sigh, âHe loves me not! He left me with a frown! sad token That misery will be my lot!â Have I such merciless pangs inflicted, On a fond heart that loves me so! Have I on that sweet face depicted The palid portraiture of wo! I can not brook the thought! 't is horror! NoâI will fly and give her peaceâ Kiss from her cheek the tear of sorrow, And cause its agonies to cease. âEmma, I come! your own Fitzhardenâ Emma, look up, I love you still! Nay, on my knees I beg your pardon; Say you forgive me, or you kill!â She hears! she smilesâthat lip of ruby, Will gently, tenderly reproveâ âGo to your work you silly booby! Alas! what fools are men in love!â THE LOVER AND THE ECHO. LOVER. Why am I doomed the pangs to prove Of absence, from my Anna far? What bars me from those lips of love, Whose color rivals cinnabar? ECHO. A rival's sin, a bar. LOVER. Is she still faithful to the vow She made at parting, breathed in sighs? Loves she with equal fervor now? Would I her heart could analyze! ECHO. Anna lies. LOVER. I 'd breathe my thoughts in amorous lay, But, ah! I know not what to write; For how can words those charms portray Which might inflame an anchorite? ECHO. In flame and anger write. LOVER. I 've praised her oft, in tuneful feet, Iambic, dactyl, and the rest, But she, with smile and accent sweet, Approved the lively anapest. ECHO. You proved the lively Ann a pest. LOVER. Oh, will she soon be joined to me, Whom she has fixed affections eye on, And I, like an engrafted tree, Nourish the young and tender scion? ECHO. Young and tender, sigh on. LOVER. Oh, did she watch the rising moon, Like me, with love and hope elated, While listening to the cricket's tune, Last Sunday evening, animated? ECHO. Last Sunday evening Anna mated. LOVER. I 've bought a ring with sparkling gem, Emblem of love that ne'er can falter, To grace her slender finger, when Her vows are plighted by the altar. ECHO. Her vows are plightedâbuy the halter! THE REPULSE. When first I sought my Lydia's love, I talked of flames and rapture; And with unceasing ardor strove Her gentle heart to capture. âI'll quit the world if I'm denied!â I said without reflection; âIf you think best,â the fair replied, âI 've not the least objection.â âHard-hearted girl! for your embrace, To dastard fear a stranger, Arabia's desert sands I'll trace, And laugh at every danger; Or scale the Andes' steepest side, To merit your affection!â âAs you think best,â she still replied, âI 've not the least objection.â âCan nothing move you? is he doomed To years of gloom and sorrow, Who fondly thought you would have bloomed His lovely bride to-morrow? My family, with joy and pride, Expect the blest connection.â âAs you think best,â she smiling cried, I 've not the least objection.â TIT FOR TAT; OR, THE COQUETTE PUNISHED. Ellen was fair, and knew it too, As other village beauties do, Whose mirrors never lie; Secure of any swain she chose, She smiles on half a dozen beaux, And, reckless of a lover's woes, She cheated these, and taunted those; âFor how could any one suppose; A clown could take her eye?â But whispers through the village ran, That Edgar was the happy man The maid designed to bless; For wheresoever moved the fair, The youth was, like her shadow, there, And rumor boldly matched the pair, For village folks will guess. Edgar did love, but still delayed To make confession to the maid, So bashful was the youth; But let the flame in secret burn, Certain of meeting a return, When, from his lips, the fair should learn, Officially, the truth. At length, one morn, to taste the air, The youth and maid, in one-horse chair, A long excursion took. Edgar had nerved his bashful heart The sweet confession to impart, For ah! suspense had caused a smart He could no longer brook. He drove, nor slackened once his reins, Till Hempstead's wide extended plains Seemed joined to skies above; Nor house, nor tree, nor shrub was near, The rude and dreary scene to cheer, Nor soul within ten miles to hearâ And still poor Edgar's silly fear Forbade to speak of love. At last, one desperate effort broke The bashful spell, and Edgar spoke With most persuasive tone; Recounted past attendance o'er, And then, by all that 's lovely, swore That he would love for evermore, If she 'd become his own. The maid in silence heard his prayer, Then, with a most provoking air, She tittered in his face; And said, â'T is time for you to know A lively girl must have a beau, Just like a reticuleâfor show; And at her nod to come and goâ But he should know his place. Your penetration must be dull, To let a hope within your skull Of matrimony spring. Your wife! ha, ha! upon my word, The thought is laughably absurd As anything I ever heardâ I never dreamed of such a thing.â The lover sudden dropped his rein, Now on the centre of the plainâ âThe linchpin's out!â he cried; âBe pleased, one moment to alight, Till I can set the matter right, That we may safely ride.â He said, and hand out the fairâ Then laughing, cracked his whip in air, And wheeling round his horse and chair Exclaimed, âAdieu, I leave you there In solitude to roam.â âWhat mean you, sir!â the maiden cried, âDid you invite me out to ride To leave me here without a guide? Nay, stop, and take me home.â âWhat! take you home?â exclaimed the beau, âIndeed, my dear, I 'd like to know How such a hopeless wish could grow, Or in your bosom spring? Take Ellen home! upon my word, The thought 's as laughably absurd As anything I ever heardâ I never dreamed of such a thing.â PRINTER, FOOL ENOUGH. Printerâfool enough, Puffs the folks so funny; He does all the puff, They get all the money! THE WHISKERS. The kings, who rule mankind with haughty sway, The prouder pope, whom even kings obeyâ Love, at whose shrine both popes and monarchs fall, And e'en self-interest, that controls them allâ Possess a petty power, when all combined, Compared with fashion's influence on mankind; For love itself will oft to fashion bow, The following story will convince you how:â A petit maitre wooed a fair, Of virtue, wealth, and graces rare; But vainly had preferred his claim, The maiden owned no answering flame; At length, by doubt and anguish torn, Suspense, too painful to be borne, Low at her feet he humbly kneeled, And thus his ardent flame revealed:â âPity my grief, angelic fair, Behold my anguish and despair; For you this heart must ever burnâ Oh, bless me with a kind return; My love no language can express, Reward it then with happiness; Nothing on earth but you I prize, All else is trifling in my eyes; And cheerfully would I resign The wealth of worlds, to call you mine. But, if another gain your hand, Far distant from my native land, Far hence, from you and hope, I'll fly, And in some foreign region die.â The virgin heard, and thus replied:â âIf my consent to be your bride Will make you happy, then be blest, But grant me first one small request; A sacrifice I must demand, And in return will give my hand.â âA sacrifice! Oh, speak its name, For you I 'd forfeit wealth and fame; Take my whole fortuneâevery centââ â'Twas something more than wealth I meant.â âMust I the realms of Neptune trace? Oh, speak the wordâwhere'er the place, For you the idol of my soul, I 'd e'en explore the frozen pole; Arabia's sandy desert tread, Or trace the Tigris to its head.â âOh no, dear sir, I do not ask So long a voyage, so great a task; You mustâbut ah! the boon I want, I have no hope that you will grant.â âShall I, like Bonaparte, aspire To be the world's imperial sire? Express the wish, and here I vow, To place a crown upon your brow.â âSir, these are trifles,â she replied; âBut if you wish me for your bride, You mustâbut still I fear to speakâ You'll never grant the boon I seek.â âOh say!â he cried, âdear angel sayâ What I must do, and I obey; No longer rack me with suspense, Speak your commands, and send me hence.â âWell, then, dear, generous youth!â she cries, âIf thus my heart you really prize, And wish to link your fate with mine, On one condition I am thine; 'T will then become my pleasing duty, To contemplate a husband's beauty; And gazing on his manly face, His feelings and his wishes trace; To banish thence each mark of care, And light a smile of pleasure there. Oh, let me then, 't is all I ask, Commence at once the pleasing task; Oh, let me, as becomes my place, Cut those huge whiskers from your face.â She saidâbut oh, what strange surprise Was pictured in her lover's eyes! Like lightning from the ground he sprung, While wild amazement tied his tongue; A statue, motionless, he gazed, Astonished, horror-struck, amazed! So looked the gallant Perseus, when Medusa 's visage met his ken; So looked Macbeth, whose guilty eye Discerned an âair-drawn daggerâ nigh; And so the prince of Denmark stared, When first his father's ghost appeared. At length our hero silence broke, And thus in wildest accents spoke: âCut off my whiskers! oh, ye gods I 'd sooner lose my ears, by odds; Madam, I 'd not be so disgraced, So lost to fashion and to taste, To win an empress to my arms, Though blest with more than mortal charms. My whiskers! Zounds!â He said no more, But quick retreated through the door And sought a less obdurate fair, Who took the beau with all his hair. THE EXPERT FRISEUR. The other day, a certain beau, Before he could a courting go, Must needs be dressed; so off he flew To the first shop that met his view. âCome, barber,â he exclaims in haste, âDisplay for once a little taste; Exert your powers, and do n't be stupid, But make me pretty as a Cupid. Consult my visage now with care, And to my looks adapt my hair.â The man, a master of his trade, His best abilities displayed; And Cupid from his chair arose, A finished beautyâwe suppose; Approached the glass, his visage spied, Then turning to the barber, criedâ âIs this your boasted taste?âfor shame! Such dressing do n't deserve the name; My head, with all these curls and plaster, Looks like the very devil, master.â The barber, in a humble tone, Replied, âDear sir, the fault 's your own, You bade me view your face with care, And to your looks adapt your hair.â RAISING THE WIND. It's ever been the study of mankind, In every station, how to raise the wind; And who attempts it with the least address, Is oft rewarded with the most success; As many a novice, by a lucky throw, Has foiled the science of a veteran foe. Raising the wind, however, I'll engage, Is not confined to climate, sex, or age; But is, in fact, the universal trade, Of infant, parent, widow, wife, and maid. Young master Fretful, spoiled by fond mamma, Espies a treasure in the sweetmeat jar; And, if refused to taste the luscious store, Tunes up his pipes to a melodious roar. âGive him a rod!â the angry father cries; âNay, nay! my dear!â the tender spouse replies, âYou'll break poor Jacky's heart, or spoil his eyes; 'T is hard to cross so innocent a wishâ Here, Jacky, take some, on this china dish; Here, deary, wipe your eyesâpapa 's unkindââ Jack smiles againâfor he has raised the wind. Tom Rustic throws the hoe indignant down, Assumes his Sunday suit, and comes to town, Obtains employment in a dry-goods store, And soon forgets whate'er he know before: Commences dandy in his dress and air, And learns to smoke and gamble, drink and swear; Transformed in manners, dialect, and feature, Till his own parents scarcely know the creature. âI sayâNedâdemmeâwhere was you last night? We 'd fun enough at Cato'sâblame me tight! I bilked the driver, tooâha, ha! keep dark, Poor yellow Billy, down there by the Park: You know that Hudson noteâwell, do n't you think, The fellow took itâgave the change in chink; The rascal certainly was drunk or blind, But, ha! ha! ha! egad, I raised the wind.â Sir Richard Rake, once lord of boundless wealth, A bankrupt now, in fortune, fame, and health, Becomes enamored of the widow Dash, Possessed of many thousand charmsâin cash; His passion knows no boundsâhe kneels and sighs, While his whole soul is beaming from his eyes. âDivine, angelic creature! Here I vow, This bosom never glowed with love till now; Oh, then, be kind, and grant my ardent prayer, Nor doom a faithful lover to despair! Your matchless charmsââ âOh, fie! Sir Richard, hush! Such high-flown praises really make me blush; Fled are the trifling charms which once were mine, Though, to be sure, I'm only thirtyânine.â âNay, hear me, dearest madameâthough I prize, Above all earthly good, those beauteous eyes! It is your mental charms that touch my heart, That cultivated mind, that heavenly part, So high above the reach of flattery's art.â âAnd do you really think so?â âShall I swear?â âOh, no, I would not drive you to despairâ Thereâthere 's my handâI can not be unkind.â 'T is thus our fortune-hunters raise the wind. But time would fail me, and your patience too, Should I this boundless subject thus pursue, And show the various arts by which mankind, Of every grade, contrive to raise the wind. The quack effects it, when and where he pleases, By advertising cures for all diseases; The politician gives his friends a lift, Then takes the fattest office in their gift. The Wall-street broker shaves you in a note, The humble showman, with a learned goat. A more adventurous soul will raise a breeze By seal-clad natives brought from over seas; While lottery-venders, thinking fortune blind, Assume her functions, and so raise the wind. Not so your humble servant, whose sole wish Was to prepare an intellectual dish To treat his friendsâand if he can not raise A gale of approbation in his praise, Yet still he hopes his well-intended toils, Will meet the gentler sunshine of your smiles. THE FIRST OF MAY; OR, THE CITY OF NEW YORK IN AN UPROAR. The curtain rises, and the play beginsâ Here at the corner, screened by oaken post, The muse shall take her stand, and view the scene. At every door, behold the ready cart Receive its cumbrous load; the horse throws round A glance of meek compassion, which to me Speaks in a language, plain as brutes can speak, âWhat a poor fool is man!â His driver swears, Wives scold, dogs bark, cats mew, and children cry, Pots break, chairs crack, pans ring, and jarring notes, Of harshest discord, rise on every side. There goes a matron with her looking-glass, A legacy from mother to her child For several generations, and she'll trust None to remove it but her careful self. But better had she stowed it on the cart Where all her baggage rides; for fate has doomed, (By sudden contact with a porter's load) To dash the sacred treasure from her hand On the unchristian pavements, where she views Here scattered hopes in rude disorder spread, Reflecting houses, passengers, and skies. Here a full barrow, piled with feather-beds, Pushed by a sturdy porter, runs you down, Ere you can shun the danger; yonder goes The sweating bearer of a precious load, Baskets of chinaware, and sweetmeat jars, And the cold relics of some late repast. And here a lumbering cart moves slowly on, Piled high with bureaus, bedsteads, tables, desks, Chairs, cradle, rubbish, washtubs, kittles, pots, Old empty barrels, benches, trammels, pans, The fire-utensils, carpet-rags, old books, And musty pamphlets, oil jugs, bottles, frames, Mats, brooms, Dutch-oven, gridirons, griddles, jacks, Trunks, piggins, toasters, pickle-pots, and all. EPIGRAM, ON THE MARRIAGE OF MR. GOLDFINCH TO MISS WEED. A Goldfinch late in search of seeds, Explored a rural bower, And found, amongst luxuriant weeds, A little, modest flower. POETICAL EPISTLE. FROM A YOUNG LADY IN NEW YORK TO HER COUSIN IN DETROIT. Sweet Coz! as brother calls youâoh I wish we had you in the city. When he was here, some time ago, He told me, puss, that you were pretty! And I have never seen you yet! No matterâfor the winter 's flying, And pa has promisedâI'm his petâ We'll come when summer gales are sighing. But still, I wish we had you here, I 've such delightful news to tell you! My heart is gone, dear coz! oh, dear! Has ever such a thing befell you? I hope your box came safe to hand, With pelerine, lace veil, and corsets, Cornelian ear-rings, breastpinâand A chain and seal like Emma D?t's. Your ma's new capâI hope it suitsâ Tell her it was by me selected, As was the pair of gaiter-bootsâ Heigh-ho! my spirits feel dejected! I told you that my heart was lostâ Perhaps 't is but the blues oppress me; For though I'm pleased with Major F?t, He wants the courage to address me. I saw him first, at Grand-Val's ball, I met him afterward at Parker's; But, oh! at Conway's concert hallâ He waited on the Misses B?rs! The one a pug-nosed, short old maid, The other, tall, slim, lean, and yellow! They stumbled through the gallopadeâ I felt so vexed!âthe stupid fellow! Though introduced, we had not yet Exchanged a dozen words together, Excepting something, I forget, About the opera and weather. As partners in the gallopade, You know, of course, we often parted: Nor cared we how the music played, But always met just where we started. His voice is manly, sweet, and clear, With tones most musically tender: His shapeâApollo Belvidere Is not so exquisitely slender. And then he 's brave as CÃ¦sar, too, Or Alexander, or Hephestion; Oh, coz! what could I say or do, If he should only pop the question? His manners are so mild and bland, Though once, 't is said, he fought a duel; He whispered somethingâpressed my handâ Would you advise me to be cruel? Of course, you know I answered not, For ma says I'm too young to marry; I blushedâlooked downâI do n't know what I might have saidâHis name is Harry. He makes up parties when he can, Of course 't is when I know the misses; They 're on the old New England planâ But pa denounces pawns and kisses; Though we suspect he liked them onceâ But mum! mamma has no suspicion; Aunt says he was not thought a dunce, When beaux were once in requisition. But let that passâhe 's older now; In June next I am one-and-twenty! You never saw so sweet a bow As Harry'sâthough you 've seen a plenty. His hair is brown, his whiskers dark, His ringlets round his temples cluster; His eyes you could not fail to mark, They shine with such a dazzling lustre. And then he writes such poetry! You must have read it in the Mirrorâ âTo Miss H. M.ââand that means me, For think you there is any dearer? And such conundrums!âhe 's the life Of all our social evening revels; Oh! when I once become his wife, Adieu to vapors and blue-devils! I saw him in the grand parade, Curbing a milk-white, prancing charger, With sash and epaulets displayedâ I wished his chapeau-bras was larger. He marched his troops down East Broadway, I saw them from the doctor's window, And caught his eyeâthat single ray Had almost made my heart a cinder! Adieu, sweet cozâI'll let you know, When we have fixed the day to marry; And may you get as sweet a beau As Major F?t, my charming Harry. When Cupid aims his feathered dart, I hope no obstacle will parry it; Such wounds are grateful to the heartâ So I remain your cousinâHarriet. P. S. Alas! dear coz, my hopes are crossed! My late bright prospects now are darker, For pa just told me Major F?t Last evening married Ellen B?er; And that they 've been for years attached, The tall, slim, gawky! lean and yellow!â But never mindâthey 're quite well matchedâ I never could endure the fellow!âH. M. ANSWER TO THE FOREGOING EPISTLE. Dear HarrietâYours of twentieth Jan. Has been received and read with pleasure; And rest assured, your cousin Ann Is highly grateful for the treasure. But we were not prepared to hear That you could be so deeply smitten; But in a New York atmosphere, We trust you have not been Frost-bitten! My prospects have not yet been crossed In such a way as late befell you; Though we have here one General Frost, Who sometimes is too rude, I tell you. He'll pinch your fingers till they smart, And even pull your ears a little; But then he can not touch the heart; His promises are all so brittle. But lovers, coz, alas! I 've none! And I should like to pay a visit To your great city, I must own, And that is not surprisingâis it! For, oh! your colonels, majors, and Subalterns of a rank inferior, Enlist recruits, I understand, Which they do n't do in the interior. I 'd like to be a colonel's aid, Provided he 's a man of spirit, Without the shadow of a shade To cloud his virtues, worth, and merit. At playhouse, opera, or ball, He 'd be a suitable protector; But there 's a street of yours named Wallâ How would you like a bank director? But let that passâI 've heard so much About your prima-donna, Fanti, And Mrs. Wood, whose tones can touch The soul, in presto or andante; Of Fanny Kembleârouts and balls, Soiries, and jams, and private parties; Of new-imported hats and shawlsâ 'T is easy telling where my heart is. I long to see your Forrest act, Your Irish Power, and native Hackett, And old friend Barnes, who is, in fact, The greatest wag that wears a jacket. Your authors, too, I wish to seeâ At least, a few of the deserving, Who shine in prose and poetry, Like Paulding, Bryant, Cooper, Irving. The fashions for the coming springâ Please send some drawings that will show them; And write me word by Mr. K?g, That I may be the first to know them. Black stocks, I hope the beaux will cast, And put on white cravats this season; For ma says stocks decline so fast, They're under par!ânow what's the reason? With you, next May, 'mid dust and smoke, 'T will be the fashion to be moving! But we are free from such a yokeâ How fast the Mirror is improving! The last plate-number, which contained Your private letter (what a pity!) Has everywhere applause obtained, In hamlet, village, town, and city. The plate presents a peerless view, And is most exquisitely finished; Verplanck's descriptive sketch is new, And Paulding's fire is not diminished. I hugely like the sketch by Power, The tale of Leggett is alarming; The Serenade's a lovely flower, And sweet Ninetta's air is charming. Has tuneful Wetmore cease to write? Is Morris still the muses moving? Who 's Peregrine, that crying wight? And what are Fay and Willis doing? And what the deuse is Cox about? Is Broadway getting gay so early? You saw Miss Cooper play, no doubtâ Pa knew her grandsire, Major Fairley. What is the latest novel called, Just stereotyped by Cooke and Conner? Is Major Frost a little bald? Now tell me, truly, coz, 'pon honor! Is Noah successful with his Star? Is Halleck married, to your knowledge? Have you rode in the railway car? Or seen the new-established college? And so, no more at present, coz, But do n't let Morris print this letter, I beg of youâfor if he does, I'll punish you as an abetter. Besides, there are some secrets in't, As you perceiveâso, be admonish; For if it should appear in print, The folks up here would be astonished.â Ann H. POSTSCRIPT. Desipere est dulce! cries The philosophic, tuneful Horaceâ So, though the act may not be wise, You may just drop a hint to Morris, That, if he'll leave out place and name, And make the verses jingle better, I should not think him much to blame, Were he to publish such a letter.â A. H. A CHARADE AND SOLUTION. My first is a vehicle, such as oft bore To battle the chivalrous heroes of yore; 'Tis the wicker-wove gondola, too, that will bear, The fearless Durant yet again in the air. My second is often by beauty caressed, Its cradle her lap, and its pillow her breast; With the choicest of food by her hand it is fed, And it even presumes to repose on her bed. My whole is the pride both of matron and maid, Who guard me with care, lest my beauties should fade; But though they affect such affection to feel, They grude me the crumbs that may fall from their meal; The servants are suffered with rudeness to treat me, To trample upon me, to shake me, and beat me; Then pray, gentle ladies, in country or city, If you know what I am, let me hope for your pity. SOLUTION. The swift war-chariot, was, of yore, Yclept a car, and often bore Some god, or chief, or princely knight, To meet the foe in desperate fight. And 't is a car that soon will bear, Durant again through fields of air! No fair but on some pet has smiled, A lapdog, kitten, lamb, or child; No fair but clasps one to her breast, Or takes it to her couch of rest. A happy union of these two, A car and pet presents to view, The meaning of a late charade, Guard well its beauties, lest they fade. A SONNET ON SONNETS. When memory takes a retrospective gaze Upon the bright effusions of my brain, She can not findâI note the fact with painâ 'Mid all that heterogeneous mass of lays, A single Sonnet! This might blight a fame Greaterâif greater can beâthan the one Which now reward the muses' favorite sonâ I mean myselfâand gilds his deathless name. This must not be, and so I'll write one now. Let's see; it must comprise just fourteen lines, Dull, flat, and heavy; this at least combines The requisites alluded to, I trow! Two more complete it; now the bard entwines The ne plus ultra garland round his laurelled brow! ELEGIAC LINES. WRITTEN AT THE REQUEST OF A YOUNG LADY, ON THE DEATH OF HER FAVORITE KITTEN. [A JUVENILE PRODUCTION.] Shall sculptured blocks and columns rise, In memory of the worthless great, And nought but tears, regrets, and sighs, Declare the humbler victim's fate? Forbid it, Justice! while my muse Will not deny her friendly aid; To Sylvia's though abstruse, Shall due respect and praise be paid. How pure her life! without a blot To stain her bright, untarnished fame! Though low, obscure, and mean her lot, Yet long shall live her humble name. How oft her sportive tricks and plays Have pleased, amused, and banished care! How oft her little winning ways Have gained caresses from the fair! How rich and envied the reward, For all her little arts to please! Here lovely mistress' kind regard, Tenfold repaid such toils as these. Who would not envy her, so blestâ Accept her fate her bliss to gain? Kissed by those lipsâpressed to that breast, Which thousands sigh to touch in vain. But, ah! her sports and plays are done! Those harmless pastimes all are fled! The tricks which those caresses won, Amuse no more!âpoor Sylvia's dead! EPIGRAM. ON THE MARRIAGE OF MR. H. LOCKE TO MISS STORMS. What daring feats the ardent youth performs, Who bares his bosoms to resistless Storms; And, like the fabled heathen god, who chained And in a cave the warring winds restrained, So Henry bids the very name to cease; Secured by Locke the Storms now smile in peace. TIME'S AUCTION. A NEW-YEAR'S POEM, ADDRESSED TO A LADY. 'T was near that âwitching time of night,â When spectres walk, and poets write; The play was out, the shops were closed, And all the laboring world reposed; The waning moon was yet asleep, Or had not risen from the deep; When, in my elbow-chair reclined, Thy form, fair lady, crossed my mind, And I resolved to frame a lay, Addressed to you, on New-Year's day: But strove in vainâfor every Muse Appeared determined to refuse The smallest favor I could askâ And I resigned the hopeless task; Sank backward in my crazy chair, The haggard picture of despair! When, suddenly, my vision failed! And such a sound my ears assailed, As filled my trembling heart with dread, And shook the rafters o'er my head! ('T is true, just then, I can't deny, Four hackney-coaches thundered by;) Grimalkin gave a dreadful scream! (She might have had a frightful dream;) And Pug emitted such a groan, As if some cur had stole his bone! I felt my creeping blood recoil! The lamp burnt blue!â(it wanted oil;) My bristling hair now stood erect! (For lack of combing, I suspect;) My eye-balls, in their sockets, glared! A certain sign that I was scared! I listened, still, in breathless dread, To hear the slow and heavy tread Of some ascending footstep near, Which fell like lead upon my ear! Nor listened longâmy garret door, Which has been safely latched before, Without a touch, wide open flew! And what a spectre met my view! An old, decrepid sage appeared, With hollow cheek, and snowy beard; A wrinkled forehead, soaring high Above a deeply-sunken eye; With head quite bald, except before, Where one long silver lock he wore; One arm a ponderous scythe sustained, One hand an hour-glass, almost drained, In which the sand was wasting fastâ (The recent year was almost past;) 'T was father TimeâI knew him well, And hailed him welcome to my cell; Intreating him awhile to stop, To warm his hands, and take a drop. âTime never stops!â he hoarsely cried, âFor no one tarries time nor tide! Though all abuse me as I pass, And strive to break my scythe and glass; Though all misuse and treat me ill, Yet I keep jogging forward still. But having ever met from you That courtesy, to old age due, Which you are exercising NOW, (I smiled, and made my prettiest bow,) I felt inclined, in passing by, To let you know the reason why The Muses came not at your callâ They're going to the New-Year's ball! And as, at such an hour, you know, 'T is requisite to have a beau; Of course, it naturally will follow, That their gallant is gay Apollo. No wonder, then, that you, in vain, Have summoned this Parnassian train; For let the fair but scent a ball, And all, but Death, may vainly call. âBut fare you well! I can not stay, For ere these sands have run away, The custom-house of Heaven will clear An out-bound shipâthe good Old-Year. And there 's another one, I learn, Belonging to the same concern, Full freighted, just come in from sea, Arrived below, consigned to me; And ere the hour of twelve be tolled, Her precious cargo must be sold; Comprising minutes, hours, and days, And other goods above all praise; Put up in lots, as each prefers, To suit all sorts of purchasers, A day, a week, a month, or year, And I must play the Auctioneer. Come with me, and attend the sale, 'T will serve you for a New-Year's tale. No sooner had the spectre spoke, Than quick I seized my hat and cloak, And sallied forth, with hope inspired. The citizens had all retired, One âguardian of the nightâ except, Who on a stoop securely slept. My sage companion tottered on, ExclaimingââGoing!âgoing!âgone! A Year, in months, or weeks, for sale! Who bids for part, or all the bale! What for an hour?âor twenty-four? With privilege of taking more! Who bids!âthe sale 's without reserve, And none must from the contract swerve.â âPut up,â exclaimed a bright-winged elf, âEach moonlight evening by itself; The summer ones so much I prize, I'll bid a thousand tender sighs.â âOnce! twice! a-going!âwho bids more?â Grief added to the sum a score, With twenty thousand tears beside. Philosophy stepped up with pride, And offered for each cloudless night Twelve problems, which heâmeant to write! Poor Poetry approached the scene, With threadbare coat, and pensive mein, A brimful heart, and empty purse, And bid two thousand feet ofâverse! Old Time, who took the wink from me, Knocked down the lot to Poetry, Who would no article remove, Till he had shared the whole with Love! Another lot, of darker hue, The salesman next held up to view, Exclaiming, as he shook his glassâ âHere 's goods of quite a different class; A lot of nights, in cloudy weather, Who bids?âthe whole must go together; For fireworks and illuminations, And various other âdemonstrations,â This kinds of goods is just the thing; Who bids!âthey'll go for what they'll bring.â A host of fiends approached the spot, Each eager to secure the lot: Sly crafty Fraud, mean Breach-of-trust, Intemperance, Murder, Theft, and Lust, And every imp of Heaven accursed. Such rapid bids from crime and vice, Secured the goods a heavy price; And ere the buyers left the spot, They all agreed to share the lot. The crowd increased; the sage, perplext, Put up a lot of week-days next; Industry bid, but Speculation Outbid him without hesitation, Until they run the lot so high, That all the rest refused to buy; The auctioneer to dwell was loth, So knocked the package down to both. The Sundays only now remained, For which fair bids were soon obtained; Pleasure and Indolence expected To have the pleasant ones selected For them aloneâto take the best, And leave Religion all the rest. But Time to this would not agree, So knocked them down to Piety; Exclaiming, âGoing!âgoing!!âgone!!!â The clock struck twelve!â'twas New-Year's morn! Aroused by poor grimalkin's scream, I woke, and found 't was all aâdream! But, lady, should my dream prove true, And Time have sold such goods to you, May every bale, and lot, and piece, Your capital of bliss increase, While you deposite the avails In heaven, a bank that never fails. And when the great account, at last, Is posted, and correctly cast, The balance-sheet will clearly prove That you 've eternal funds above. Till then, may pleasure crown you here, For many a New and Happy Year. CONVIVIAL SONGS AND GLEES. THY RUBY LIPS MUST KISS THE BRIM. Thy ruby lips must kiss the brim Before I drain the cup, Its lustre else will be too dim To light my spirits up. Nay, taste, my loveâits purple hue Will brighter paint thy lip; Thine eye will gain new lustre too, Thy soul new ardorâsip! If rosy wine have power to cheer The regents of the sky, This idea smacks of Paganism; but I dare not avail myself of higher authority in a convivial song, or I would refer to him who said, that âwine cheereth God and man.â It sure will chase away the tear That dims an angel's eye. Then taste, my loveâits purple hue Will brighter dye thy lip; Thine eye will gain new lustre too, Thy soul new ardorâsip! TARGET-SHOOTING. Now ruthless Mars, while his war-dogs are dozing, May curry his coursers and burnish his car, While in the sunshine of peace we 're reposing, Gayly we practice the duties of war. Bright are our arms as the eyes of the lasses, True to their object as Love's feathered dart, Swift through the target the charmed bullet passes, Swift as the arrows of love through the heart. Charge, then, your bumpers high, Drain every goblet dry, Sparkles of wit like its red drops shall glow; Thus spend this festal day, Till we in full repay The duty and booty to Beauty we owe. Life is a game full of hazard and chances, Each tries his luck for a hit or a miss, Trusting to fortune, each youth thus advances Oft gets a kick where he shoots for a kiss. Whether he wins by a bribe, like Polyctor, Or fortune, or fate has directed the shaft, Pleasure still mingles a bowl for the victor, Eager he drains its contents at a draught. Seize, then, the present hour, While joy is in our power, Mirth unrestrained like our red wine shall flow; Thus spend this festal day, Till we in full repay The duty and booty to Beauty we owe. Fame is the prize which ambition contends for, Rank is the mark to which Folly aspires, Gold is the object which Avarice bends for, Peace and content are what Virtue acquires. Glory's the prize which we soldiers would try for, Fired with the plaudits which beauty will give, Freedom and country we 'd willingly die for, Wine, wit, and womenâfor them we would live. Charge, then, your bumpers high, Drain every goblet dry, Sparkles of wit like its red drops shall glow; Thus spend the festal day, Till we in full repay The duty and booty to Beauty we owe. THE KROUT FEAST.âNO. 1. Krouts, who have so often fed Here, on cabbage white and red, Welcome nowâthe board is spread For our revelry! Now 's the day, and now 's the hour, See! our royal chief devour, Sausage, goose, and cabbage sour, Scorning rivalry! Who would be to care a slave? Who, at such a feast, be grave? Who refuse to chant a stave? Let him quickly flee! Who for cabbage, king, and law, Knife and fork will freely draw, 'Till there 's naught but bones to gnaw, Let him do like me! By an empty stomach's pain, By blue devils in the brain, We will eat, and quaff champagne, 'Till the demons flee! Lay the krout and smoked-goose low, Let the wine in torrents flow 'Till the cheeks with rapture glow, 'T is our king's decree! Load your plates above the rim, Fill your glasses to the brim, Think what honors wait on him, Who the prize receives! 'T is a race of bright renown, 'T is to win a princely crown, 'T is to wear a royal gown, Made of cabbage leaves! Krouts, then play your manly parts, With the puddings, pies, and tarts; Cabbage-heads have generous hearts, Let them bound with glee 'T is a custom we revere, 'T is a feast to Dutchmen dear, Knickerbockers every year Keep the jubilee! THE KROUT FEAST.âNO. 2. Again, brother krouts, are we gayly united, In stuffing and swigging to honor our chief, Each feeling his services richly requited, In laughing and quaffing, a stranger to grief. Then hail to the banquet of reason and pleasure! The envy of heroes and monarchs no doubt, For this is a bliss they would prize above measure, To feast upon cabbage converted to krout; The round-headed cabbage, the soft pulpy cabbage, The sweet, wholesome cabbage, converted to krout. Oh, think of the prize that is now set before us, A throne and a sceptre, a crown, and a robe; Then eat 'till you burstâin a contest so glorious, No true-hearted krout but would swallow the globe. The wine sparkles brightly, then quaff as you mingle it, Replenish your plates, too, as soon as they are out, With smoke-seasoned goose, and the savory ringlet, With soft, pulpy cabbage converted to krout; The round-headed cabbage, the soft pulpy cabbage, The sweet, wholesome cabbage, converted to krout. Long life to our monarch, whose station exempts him, From each vulgar drudgery, even to think, Except to devour sour-krout when it temps him, Or when the wine sparkles before him, to drink. Such a king can, of course, do no wrong to the nation, His ministers answer when radicals flout; Then brave Knickerbockers, lets strive for the station, By feasting on cabbage converted to krout; The round-headed cabbage, the soft pulpy cabbage, The sweet, wholesome cabbage, converted to krout. WHEN EYES ARE BRIGHT. When eyes are bright with pleasure, And brows with wreaths are crowned, To music's sweetest measure The heart shall gayly bound. While pallid care forgets to call, And smiling beauty lights the hall, Devote to bliss the present hour, Perhaps the next may darkly lower. When eyes are bright with pleasure, And brows with wreaths are crowned, To music's sweetest measure The heart shall gayly bound. This life were but a dreary scene, Without such little spots of green; But every joy like this to taste, Imparts new strength to tread the waste. When eyes are bright with pleasure, And brows with wreaths are crowned, To music's sweetest measure The heart shall gayly bound. Such pleasures leave no sting behind, But sweetly elevate the mind, 'Till every heart, with generous glow, Is blest to see its neighbor so. When eyes are bright with pleasure, And brows with wreaths are crowned, To music's sweetest measure The heart shall gayly bound. AMITY, HOPE, AND PLEASURE. AN ADAPTATIOM TO AN ITALIAN AIR. Night's ebony car descending, Rolls rapidly down the sky, While numerous sylphs attending, Show revel y's hour is nigh. Now amity, hope, and pleasure, Smile placidly, kiss, and toy, While trippingly dance in measure, Love, liberty, peace, and joy. Late dismally pining daily, Hearts languidly sunk in wo, Now merrily bounding gayly, All playfully throb and glow Now amity, hope, and pleasure, Smile placidly, kiss, and toy, While trippingly dance in measure, Love, liberty, peace, and joy. YE CARELESS, SMILING SONS OF MIRTH. Ye careless smiling sons of mirth, Of warm and generous soul, Who share, with hearts of kindred worth, The pleasures of the bowl; When round the festive board convened, Where wit and mirth combine, Jests abound, Songs go round, Hearts are warm, care is drowned, If on earth bliss be found, 'T is in friendship, love, and wine. Then fill the mantling goblet high, 'Till brilliants deck its brim, And drink to her whose sparkling eye, Would make their lustre dim. The toast shall pass, the glee go round, Such smiling fair is mine, May she miss No true bliss, Dance and song, love's warm kiss, Days and nights, bright as this, Blest with friendship, love, and wine. LET POLITICIANS RAIL AND FIGHT. Let politicians rail and fight, For president or king, We care not which is wrong or right, But gayly drink and sing. The only party we would join, Is that of woman, wit, and wine. Then we'll push about the bowl, my boys, Then we'll push about the bowl, To exhilarate the soul, And heighten our convivial joys. FILL A BUMPER, LET IT PASS. Fill a bumper, let it pass, This shall be our parting glass; When again we thus convene, Equal joy shall crown the scene, Wine and music, mirth and wit, Every eye with pleasure lit; Parting is not painful, when We but part to meet again. MARTIAL AND PATRIOTIC PIECES. FREEDOM'S STAR. Hail, Star of Freedom, hail! Whose splendor ne'er shall fail, In peace or war; Long shall thy golden ray O'er these blessed regions play, While millions own the sway Of Freedom's Star. Our sires, a pilgrim band, Who sought this promised land, From realms afar, Spurned fell oppression's sway, And dared the pathless way, Led by the golden ray Of Freedom's Star. Their sons, with kindred flame, Have earned an equal fame, In peace and war! Determined to be free, Have fought by land and sea, Led on to victory, By Freedom's Star! Beneath her temple's dome, Here wanderers find a home From realms afar! Blest in their happy choice, Here will they long rejoice, And with united voice, Hail Freedom's Star! FREEDOM'S CONSTELLATION. Glory gilds the western skies With bright irradiation, Where brilliant stars so oft arise In Freedom's constellation. See the glittering orbs revolve Around the sun of Union! And never shall the tie dissolve Which holds them in communion. This exalts Columbia's cause, And gilds her reputation; This secures her earth's applause, And Heaven's approbation. Long shall live Columbia's name, In patriotic story, And long around her brow shall flame A bright, unsullied glory. Virtue's panoply she wears, Her weapons truth and justice; The olive-branch her standard bears, In Heaven alone her trust is. This exalts Columbia's cause, &amp;c. Mild religion's lucid ray Her glowing prospect brightens, And superstition shuns the day Which literature enlightens. Charity's celestial flame Here sheds its mild effulgence, For every party, sect, and name, Enjoys the same indulgence. This exalts Columbia's cause, &amp;c. Freemen reap the fertile soil Their valor has defended, And smiling plenty crowns the toil Which health and hope attended. Exiles here a refuge find, Secure from persecution, And bless the wisdom that designed Our glorious constitution. This exalts Columbia's cause, &amp;c. See our mighty realm increase, Since independence crowned it, And its growth shall never cease, Till oceans only bound it. Still Columbia never fights For conquest or for plunder; Nothing but insulted right Can wake her martial thunder. This exalts Columbia's cause, &amp;c. See Neptune with the lakes alliedâ No legendary storyâ The god of ocean gains a bride Where Perry wedded glory. See potent steam's resistless charm Uniting distant places, Till Mississippi's giant arm The Hudson's form embraces. This exalts Columbia's cause &amp;c. Hail, thou mistress of the West! Where freemen hold dominion, Where the dove may safely rest Beneath the eagle's pinion. Long as Cynthia wheels her car, Or PhÅbus holds his station, Be virtue still the brightest star In Freedom's Constellation. This exalts Columbia's cause, And gilds her reputation; This secures her earth's applause, And Heaven's approbation. FREEDOM'S JUBILEE. Freedom's jubilee again Calls for music's richest strain, Hail her bright auspicious reign, Hail the jubilee! Louder let the anthem swell, And to listening seraphs tell, That the land in which we dwell, Ever will be free! On this day Columbians broke Stern oppression's galling yoke, And, by one decisive stroke, Made their children free! 'T was the birth of freedom here, 'T is a day to freemen dear, Let us, then, each rolling year, Keep the jubilee! Long and bloody was the fray, Ere Columbia gained the day, Lowly many a hero lay, Dying to be free! But immortal Washington Led Columbia's patriots on, Till the glorious prize was won, Peace and Liberty! THE VICTOR COMES, HUZZA! Flee, busy care! the god of war Will guard him in the fray, And where the rudest dangers are, His plume is seen to play. Where martial banners proudly wave, And flashing blades appear, There moves the leader of the brave, His heart unknown to fear The routed foe, retreating, To freemen yield the day; The roll of joy is beating, The field is ours, huzza! My hero claims the brightest wreath, The loudest note of fame, Let Music's voice his praises breath, And bards repeat his name. He comes to bless my longing arms, And cheer his lonely bride; Safe from the battle's rude alarms, He comes in martial pride. He comes with smiles returning, In triumph's glittering car; The torch of joy is burning, The victor comes, huzza! DEATH ON THE BATTLE-FIELD. The tempest of battle was loud, And proudly the banners were streaming, While bright as the flash in the cloud, The blade of the hero was gleaming. And Fame shall exultingly tell, How firmly in fight he contended, 'Till covered with glory, he fell On the field he so bravely defended. YES, YES, I GO. âYes, yes, I goââhe whispered soft, âIn freedom's cause my sword to wield, Columbia's banner waves aloft, And glory calls me to the field.â Then foremost on the foe he prest, While war's rude tempest wildly roared, Till gushing from the hero's breast The purple tide in torrents poured. He fell, and oh! what fancies stole Through memory vista, bright and warm, Till one loved image o'er his soul Came like an angel in the storm. But loudly swelled the bugle's blast, His hand instinctive grasped the steel; Again it swelledâbut all was past, The warrior's breast had ceased to fell. WAR. Gentle Peace, on ruffled pinion, Flies from Freedom's injured realm; War extends his rough dominion, Vengeance nodding on his helm. Harshly sounds the trumpet's clamor, While our warriors leap to arms; Beauty shrinks in fearful tremor, Snatching graces from alarms. Harsh to us the martial clarion, Who with peace and freedom blest, Bade the desert, drear and barren, Smile a garden in the west. Harsh to us, whose fair pretensions Ne'er infringed a nation's right, Who have tamely borne aggressions, Rather than engage in fight. THE ONSET. See! at length, indignant Justice Bares her sabre's spotless blade! Swears by him in whom her trust is, Every wrong shall be repaid! Hark! the horrid fray commences! Mars has slipped the dogs of war, Death on every side dispenses Spreading ruin round his car. 'T WAS WAR. 'T was war!âand the plough in the furrow was stayed, Each art was relinquished for musket and blade; The pipe of the swain in the valley was still, While the bugle rung loud from each fortified hill. The cause of humanity, freedom, and truth, Enkindled a flame in the breast of each youth, Which, fanned by the air that our freemen respire, Soon burst on the foe in a deluge of fire. THE BATTLE. RECITATIVE. Oh, who, reclined in dastard ease, Could hear his country call in vain, Or view her banner court the breeze, Nor sigh to seek the hostile plain? AIR. Oh, perish such wretches! while, eager for glory, The youth of our country are rushing to arms; The deeds of our sires, if we list to the story, Excite in our bosoms a spirit that charms. RECITATIVE. But hark! the cannon's awful roar Proclaims the deadly fray begun! The hostile ranks have met once more, And clouds of smoke obscure the sun. AIR. The soul-stirring bugle now sounds to the charge, And our cavalry rush like a tempest along; The wing of the foe, on the cataract's verge, Is broken and turned by a current so strong. The havoc increases, the squadrons unite, The clashing of sabres is heard in the din, All rushing with ardor to share in the fight, While bayonets bristle terrific between. The shouts of the victors, the groans of the dying, The shrill-sounding fife, and the drum's noisy rattle, The prancing of coursers, in charging or flying, Unite in augmenting the din of the battle. RECITATIVE. But, hark! the distant bugle's strain Proclaims the vanquished foe is flying; He leaves behind the ensanguined plain, Where half his host are dead or dying. AIR. The tumult subsides, and the carnage is done, The field is our own, for the battle is won; Our bugle proclaims us the lords of the day, With victory, liberty, glory, huzza! THE BUGLE. Deep murmuring down the lonely dell, The dull tattoo, with drowsy swell, Had bid the march-worn soldier rest, With armor buckled on his breast. But, hark! what cry alarms? The foe at hand!âto arms! And, darting from the ground, The slumbering veterans bound, While the bugle sounds the charge, rousing echo with the sound. And now the cannon's sullen roar, Deep rolls along Ontario's shore, While Freedom's sons surprised remain, Their watchword stoleâtheir pickets slain. In vain their trump alarms, In vain they cry, to arms! The foe from ambush springs, Their yells the welkin rings, While the bugle sounds retreat, adding speed to terror's wings. Shall Freedom's veterans fly the field, Her heroes shrinkâher chieftains yield? Say, where 's the spirit of the brave Who bled Columbia's rights to save? It lives! it breathes! it warms! Roused by the clash of arms, Vengeance, with eye of flame, Fires with a love of fame, While the bugle sounds the rally, until victory we claim. INDEPENDENCE. Come, crowd around the festive board, And join the song with one accord, Be every breast with pleasure stored, And care and envy send hence. Our dear-bought freedom we will praise, Dear-bought freedomâdear-bought freedomâ Our dear-bought freedom we will praise, The right of our descendants; Our dear-bought freedom we will praise, And every glowing heart shall raise The chorus of our joyful lays, Columbia's Independence. Be party rancor banished hence, For peace is virtue's recompense; Friendship and love on no pretence Should ever meet with hinderance. Let sons of freedom e'er agreeâ Sons of freedomâsons of freedomâ Let sons of freedom e'er agree, In amity's attendance; Let sons of freedom e'er agree, For why should men, existing free, Deform with discord's stormy seaâ Columbia's Independence! We here assemble to rejoice That patriots, with united voice, Once rose and made this manly choice, For them and their descendants. They freedom's eagle raised on highâ Freedom's eagleâfreedom's eagleâ They freedom's eagle raised on high, Amid the stars' resplendence; They freedom's eagle raised on high, And swore to fight or bravely die, If foreign despots dare deny Columbia's Independence. Bellona goads her foaming steeds, Beneath her car Oppression bleeds, And Tyranny with haste recedes, With all his cursed attendants; Our patriot fathers gained the dayâ Patriot fathersâpatriot fathersâ Our patriot fathers gained the day, For them and their descendants; Our patriot fathers gained the day, For which we raise the joyful lay, And on our banners still display Columbia's Independence. Then Freedom bade her temple rise, Whose fabric every foe defies, While joyous seraphs from the skies Bestow their glad attendance; And shades of martyrs smiling seeâ Shades of martyrsâshades of martyrsâ And shades of martyrs smiling see The joy of their descendants; And shades of martyrs smiling see Their sons united, brave, and free, And yearly hail, with mirth and glee, Columbia's Independence. HARK! THE CLAMOROUS BUGLE. HE. Hark! the clamorous bugle calls me; Fare thee well, I must away; SHE. How, alas! the sound appals me! Heaven protect thee in the fray. HE. Fame invites me, SHE. Danger frights me, HE. Danger is the path to fame; SHE. Fame shall bless thee, Love caress thee; HE. Love and glory gild my name. SHE. Hark! again the bugle loudly BOTH. Echoes through the leafy dell; Warrior plumes are nodding proudly; HE. Glory calls me, fare thee well. BOTH. Fare thee well, love, fare thee well. THE GOD OF BATTLE. The God of battle be thy shield, And guard my love from danger, When havoc desolates the field, Whence pity flies a stranger. Where hearts, determined to be free, Assume relentless rigor, And arms which strike for liberty, Possess immortal vigor. There guard my gallant soldier's breast, Till victory light upon his crest; And when the foeman flies before him, Oh, then to love and me restore him. THE PATRIOTIC DIGGERS. Johnny Bull beware, Keep at proper distance, Else we'll make you stare At our firm resistance; Let alone the lads Who are freedom tasting, Recollect our dads Gave you once a basting. Pickaxe, shovel, spade, Crowbar, hoe, and barrow, Better not invade, Yankees have the marrow. To protect our rights 'Gainst your flints and triggers, See on Brooklyn Heights Our patriotic diggers; Men of every age, Color, rank, profession, Ardently engage, Labor in succession. Pickaxe, shovel, spade, Crowbar, hoe, and barrow, Better not invade, Yankees have the marrow. Grandeur leaves her towers, Poverty her hovel, Here to join their powers With the hoe and shovel. Here the merchant toils With the patriot sawyer, There the laborer smiles, Near him sweats the lawyer. Pickaxe, shovel, spade, Crowbar, hoe, and barow, Better not invade, Yankees have the marrow. Here the mason builds Freedom's shrine of glory, While the painter gilds The immortal story. Blacksmiths catch the flame, Grocers feel the spirit, Printers share the fame, And record their merit. Pickaxe, shovel, spade, Crowbar, hoe, and barrow, Better not invade, Yankees have the marrow, Scholars leave their schools With their patriot teachers; Farmers seize their tools, Headed by their preachers. How they break the soil! Brewers, butchers, bakers, Here the doctors toil, There the undertakers. Pickaxe, shovel, spade, Crowbar, hoe, and barrow, Better not invade, Yankees have the marrow. Bright Apollo's sons Leave their pipe and tabor, 'Mid the roar of guns Join the martial labor; Round the embattled plain In sweet concord rally, And in freedom's strain Sing the foe's finale! Pickaxe, shovel, spade, Crowbar, hoe, and barrow, Better not invade, Yankees have the marrow. Plumbers, founders, dyers, Tinmen, turners, shavers, Sweepers, clerks, and criers, Jewellers, engravers, Clothiers, drapers, players, Cartmen, hatters, tailors, Guagers, sealers, weighers, Carpenters, and sailors. Pickaxe, shovel, spade, Crowbar, hoe, and barrow, Better not invade, Yankees have the marrow. Better not invade; Recollect the spirit Which our dads displayed, And their sons inherit; If you still advance, Friendly caution slighting, You may get, by chance, A bellyful of fighting. Pickaxe, shovel, spade, Crowbar, hoe, and barrow, Better not invade, Yankees have the marrow. THE JUBILEE. While freedom's bright banner is waving unfurled, And millions are hailing the birth of a nation, Let the voice of our cannon proclaim to the world The joy that we feel on this grand celebration. Independent and free, We swear still to be, And bequeath to our children this bright jubilee. And millions unborn shall exultingly say, A nation of freemen was born in a day. But long was the conflict our fathers sustained, For strong was the iron-nerved arm of oppression, Till valor and justice the victory gained, And wrung from the foe a reluctant concession. In field, and on flood, Mid torrents of blood, Undaunted, the bulwark of freedom, they stood, Till an empire was founded that ne'er shall decay, When a nation of freemen was born in a day. Their souls at no prospect of danger e'er quaked, In securing the right of their grateful descendants; For fortune, existence, and honor, were staked, To support the bold charter of proud independence. They swore to be free, And the godlike decree Secures us the bliss of this grand jubilee. For an empire was founded that ne'er shall decay, And a nation of freemen was born in a day. The white dove of peace with her olive returned, By science, and learning, and genius attended; On liberty's altar new incense was burned, Where valor and love were in harmony blended. In union combined, They expanded the mind, Till ocean, and rivers, and lakes are combined. Thus an empire is founded, that ne'er shall decay Since a nation of freemen was born in a day. Then wake the loud anthem in liberty's praise, While millions unite in the grand celebration; And the symbols of joy which our country displays, Shall spread through the world a sublime emulation. Till happy and free, All nations agree, To celebrate Liberty's grand jubilee. And millions unborn shall exultingly say, A nation of freemen was born in a day. FREEDOM, LOVE, AND FAME. RECITATIVE. How bright and joyous nature bloomed Beneath a vernal sky, Ere he who won my heart had doomed That heart alone to sigh. But love of fame inspired his breast, And now in fields afar, With crimsoned blade, and towering crest, He seeks the din of war. AIR. High o'er the field, in martial pride, His starry banner waves, Where heroes stem the battle tide, Or sink in hallowed graves! There, mid the rude and maddening clash, Of Havoc's vengeful steel, His falchion gleams, the lightning flash That leads the thunder peal. His deeds shall live in story, He strikes in Freedom's name, For country, home, and glory, Inspired by love and fame! Rude was the shock! the squadrons close! And freemen win the field! On! victors, on! pursue your foes! But spare them when they yield. Relieved from sterner duty, The hero now may claim The sweetest smiles of beauty, With Freedom, Love, and Fame. COLUMBIA, THE PRIDE OF THE WORLD. Oh, there is a region, a realm in the West, To Tyranny's shackles unknown, A country with union and liberty blest, That fairest of lands is our own. Where commerce has opened her richest of marts, Where freedom's bright flag is unfurled, The garden of science, the seat of the arts, Columbia, the pride of the world. The rays of her glory have lighted the earth, While Tyranny's minions, dismayed, Acknowledged her prowess, admitted her worth, And shrunk at the flash of her blade. For conquest or plunder she never contends, For freedom, her flag is unfurled; And foemen in battle, in peace are thy friends, Columbia, the pride of the world. Her clime is a refuge for all the oppressed, Whom tyranny urges to roam; And every exile we greet as a guest, Soon feels like a brother at home. Then hail to our country, the land of our birth, Where freedom's bright flag is unfurled; The rays of whose glory have lighted the earth, Columbia, the pride of the world. ODE, SUNG AT THE CELEBRATION OF INDEPENDENCE BY THE SOCIETY OF JUVENILE PATRIOTS. [AN EARLY JUVENILE PRODUCTION.] When from our shores Bellona's car Recoiled amid dread scenes of war; The guardian genius of our land Gave listening freemen this commandâ âRevere fair Freedom's chosen son, Protect with life the prize he won.â High on her right the hero stood, Victorious from the fields of blood, And poised to heaven his reeking blade, As witness to the vow he made:â âThis arm, with Heaven for its shield, Shall e'er protect the dear-bought field.â The goddess heard the solemn vow, And twined the laurel round his brow; While swelled the anthem to his praise, And spheres responsive caught the laysâ âRevere the hero, Washington, For he your independence won.â Then, while we consecrate the day Which gave our land its lawful sway, Let all our bosoms glow with fires Becoming sons of hero sires; Swear ne'er to forfeit what they won, While earth revolves around the sun. And while our goblets flow with wine, While rich libations grace the shrine, In clouds of incense to the skies Let this inspiring theme arise:â âThe youth of freedom e'er will be Champions of sacred Liberty.â While Mars' red banner floats unfurled, O'er the blood-deluged eastern world, Here, Peace shall bless us with her reign, While Virtue, Right, and Faith remain; And let mad Europe blush to see That Peace can dwell with Liberty. But if our foes should e'er conspire To kindle Freedom's funeral pyre, And slaves of tyrants join the band To subjugate their native land, Our youth, indignant, then shall rise, And save the dearly-purchased prize. Our fathers fought, and scorned to yield, But drove Oppression from the field; Then gave this mandate with the prize, To unborn patriots yet to rise:â âProtect the blessing we bestow, And guard your rights from every foe.â Then, youthful patrots, rise, and swear To hold the glorious name you bear; Your dear-bought freedom to maintain, While ocean, earth, or sky remain; And, like your fathers, still to be Independent, great, and free. THE SONS OF COLUMBIA. The Genius of Freedom, escaped from the flood Which had deluged the world, and usurped her dominion, On the glaciers of Switzerland tremblingly stood, To heaven she looked and extended her pinion; When over the main Was wafted the strain, Which Echo, in raptures, repeated againâ âThe sons of Columbia have sworn to be free, And their arms shall maintain what their voices decree.â She heard it, and westward directed her flight, Till our hills met her view in fair grandeur ascending, When her temple's effulgence burst full on her sight, And her sons were the rites of her worship attending. Her altar was reared, And while freemen revered, The anthem was struck, and this chorus she heardâ âThe sons of Columbia have sworn to be free, And their arms shall maintain what their voices decree.â Then here let the temple for ever be found, Ye priests, who attend, guard the shrine from pollution; In the midst be the statue of Washington crowned, With the laurels he won in our grand revolution. Swell the anthem again To Liberty's reign, And this be the chorus to finish the strainâ âThe sons of Columbia have sworn to be free, And their arms shall maintain what their voices decree.â On high soars our eagle, begemmed with the stars, A dread to our foe, but a dove to our brother; One talon still clinching the thunder of Mars, But the olive of peace is held forth in the other. The world may unite, With treble our might; We proffer them peace, but can meet them in fightâ For the sons of Columbia have sworn to be free, And their arms shall maintain what their voices decree. Ye heroes who once so impregnable stood 'Gainst Britain's whole prowess, and scorned to bend under, Once more you are called, by your countryman's blood, Alluding to the death of Captain Pierce, who was killed by the British within our own waters, during the period of their aggressions on American commerce, and their impressment of American seamen. The record lives, though our resentments have expired.â Author. To wreak your revenge and proclaim it in thunder; Be our banners unfurled, Our thunderbolts hurled, And our cannon shall loudly proclaim to the world, That the sons of Columbia have sworn to be free, And their arms shall maintain what their voices decree. Can freemen consent that the day which we hold, To celebrate Liberty's birth in our nation, Should find us so torpid, insensible, cold, As to suffer in silence the least degradation? Yet be it declared, That Britain has dared To strike at the fabric which Washington reared; But the sons of Columbia have sworn to be free, And their arms shall maintain what their voices decree. Arise, injured freemen! again grasp the spear, And hurl on aggressors the vengeance they merit; The blessing preserve which you value so dear, The blessing our fathers have bid us inherit. Indignant arise, Britain's lion despise, And swear by the Ruler of earth, sea, and sky, That the sons of Columbia will ever be free, And their arms shall maintain what their voices decree! LIBERTY AND INDEPENDENCE. When the fiend of fell discord had deluged in gore The nations of Europe who bowed to the demon, And Oppression's black sceptre was held o'er the shore Once chartered by Heaven, the birthright of freemen; In a chariot of flame Fair Liberty came, And the armor of Pallas encircled the dame: Attend to her call, sons of Freedom, arise, Independence in thunder proclaim to the skies. Inspired by the genius, our fathers unfurled Her star-spangled banner, owned her dominion; Bade their cannon indignant proclaim to the world Their oath to be freemen in act and opinion. While her eagle on high, Flashing fire from his eye, Saw the olive disdained, and his thunders let fly. Then the watchword was FreedomâColumbia arise, Independence in thunder proclaim to the skies. The foe in confusion recoiled from our shore, Where Tyranny's upas in vain sought to flourish; But the soil he relinquished, enriched with his gore, Shall for ages the fair tree of Liberty nourish. Mid its branches above, In a union of love, The eagle shall nestle and sport with the dove. While, from myriads of freemen this chorus shall riseâ âIndependence is ours, we'll proclaim to the skies.â But, hark! what hoarse discord our senses assail! Our bird grasps his thunders, extends his broad pinions, And perched mid the stars, he hears borne on the gale, Ambition's proud threat to invade his dominions But our heroes advance, And alert seize the lance, To repel the encroachments of England or France. âIndependence!âwe'll never relinquish the prize,â Let your cannon in thunder proclaim to the skies. Rise, freemen, arise! let this festival day, Devoted to joy and refined recreation, See millions stand ready, alert to obey, Should Liberty call to repel an invasion. Your weapons retain, While the goblet you drain, Your toast, âDeath or freedom,â and crowned with this strain:â âIndependence!âwe'll never relinquish the prize,â Let the oath be in thunder proclaimed to the skies. INAUGURATION ODE. While the vassals of Tyranny rivet their chains By birthday effusions, and base adulation, Let freemen express, in their holyday strains, The voice of a people, the choice of a nation. Let laureates sing For the birth of a king, 'T is ours to rejoice for the first fruits of spring; For still shall the Fourth Day of March ever yield A harvest of glory in Liberty's field. Encircled with glory, the chieftain retires, Who led us in safety through war's dread commotion; While the spirit that raised him, another inspires, To watch o'er our rights with equal devotion. Monroe shall preside, His countryman's pride, The soldier, the statesman, the patriot, well tried; And thus shall the Fourth Day of March ever yield A harvest of glory in Liberty's field. To legitimate tyrants no freeman shall bowâ To Virtue alone will we pay veneration: The chiefs of Columbia are called from the plough, And retire from the chair to the same occupation. Thus Tompkins arose, In the face of his foes, For the path of a patriot the âFarmer's Boyâ chose; And thus shall the Fourth Day of March ever yield A harvest of glory in Liberty's field. Then hail to the day that beholds us once more Place the chaplet of power on the brow of true merit; 'T is the sacred insignia our Washington woreâ A legacy none but the good shall inherit; To the patriot Monroe The tribute we owe, Till the people reclaim it again to bestow; And the Fourth Day of March be again made to yield A harvest of glory in Liberty's field. Let freemen unite on this festival day, To celebrate Liberty's triumph in chorus; Awaken the trumpetâour banners display, And hail the bright prospect that opens before us; In pÃ¦ans of joy Your voices employ, For the Patriot Monroe, and our own âFarmer's Boy;â And ne'er may the Fourth Day of March cease to yield A harvest of glory in Liberty's field, OUR COUNTRY. Here freedom shall flourish a star in the West; The dove and the eagle together shall rest; While science shall glow with a lustre more bright, And genius soar upward on pinions of light. The arts shall increase and refinement extend, New graces to beauty shall piety lend; The demon of selfishness shrink to his hole, And the form of each action have use for its soul. Now Commence revives, and her hundred wheels roll, Our canvass is spread from equator to pole; Antipodes gaze on our banner unfurled, For the course of our eagle shall girdle the world The genius of Plenty her office resumes, The treasures of IndiaâArabia's perfumes, Each gem and each fruit that the world can produce, Her horn pours around for our pleasure or use. The names of our heroes, recorded by Fame, Shall glow in her tablets in letters of flame; And patriots, and sages, and bards yet unborn, With splendor as brilliant the page shall adorn. WASHINGTON'S BIRTH. Bright were her smiles, when the blushing Aurora, Greeted the newly-born hope of the West; PhÅbus, advancing in chariot of glory, Gazed with delight on the infantile guest; Seraphs, commissioned to watch o'er his slumbers, Shake from their pinions the odors of bliss; While, in the softest and sweetest of numbers, Hark! they are chanting an anthem like this: Bright heir of endless fame, Thine be a deathless name, Thine be a glory to brighten the earth; Then shall a nation join, Round Freedom's sacred shrine, Hailing the day of our Washington's birth. Fame heard the chorus, and braided the laurel, Mars caught the tidings, and burnished his shield Ruthless Bellona prepared for the quarrel, Justice presented her sword for the field; Jove, from Olympus, beheld and commended, Armed his own eagle in Liberty's cause; Pallas, the goddess of wisdom, descended, Bearing the new constitution and laws:â While o'er her hills and plains, Swelled these seraphic strainsâ Rise, blest Columbia, the queen of the earth; Soon shall your tyrants flee, Soon shall your sons be free, Hail to the day of your Washington's birth. Hope smiled ecstatic, while Freedom, delighted, Fixed on a site for her temple to stand; There is her altar erected and lighted, Thence does its splendor illumine the land; Hail an event of such glory and splendor, Waken your pÃ¦ans to Washington's name; Champion of freedom, our nation's defender, Hero and statesman, eternal his fame; Still round our verdant plains, Swell these seraphic strainsâ Rise, blest Columbia, the queen of the earth; Still shall a nation join, Round Freedom's sacred shrine, Hail to the day of our Washington's birth. THE BIRTH OF WASHINGTON. When Freedom perceives from the regions above, That fiends would assail the loved empire she planted, She appealed to the Father of mercy and love, For a shield of defenceâher petition was granted. Attended by Fame, In a chariot of flame, She descended to earth this behest to proclaim, An infant is born to enlighten the earth, Then hail to the day of our Washington's birth. Years rolledâand the infant like Hercules grew, While as fast grew the Hydra of ruthless oppression; Till Tyranny's vassals their hands dared embrue, With his countrymen's bloodâhe avenged the aggressions. Long and bloody the fray Till they yielded the day, To the hero whose glory will never decay; But long shall its lustre enlighten the earth, Then hail to the day of our Washington's birth. 'T was then that the victor appeared like a god, For he thought not of self, but the good of the nation; Though a crown and a sceptre awaited his nod, He preferred, like a Roman, to till his plantation. For the helmet he now Gladly threw from his brow, And from Power's dizzy summit retired to the plough. Such brillant example enlightened the earth, Then hail to the day of our Washington's birth. Then join in the anthem with rapturous hearts, For delight and warm gratitude she must o'erflow them, Ye lovers of science and friends of the arts, 'T is to Washington's valor and wisdom you owe them. Then unite in the lay, 'T is to honor the day, For the light of its glory shall never decay, But long shall its lustre enlighten the earth, Then hail to the day of our Washington's birth. WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY. While festive joys our hearts inspire, Awake the patriotic lyre With chords of light and tones of fire, To sing a hero's worth; And let our voices swell the lay, Again to celebrate the day, Illumed with Glory's brightest ray, The day that give him birth. Ennobled by himself alone, His glory so resplendent shone, That regal sceptre, crown, and throne, Would but have dimmed its rays; Devoted to his country's cause, The champion of her rights and laws, His children are heaven's applause And earth's united praise. In halls of state, and fields of blood, He like a firm Colossus stood, His object still Columbia's good, His trust in Heaven alone; But when the avenging deed was done, And Freedom's host the field had won, Then was immortal Washington Throned in a nation's love. When War's dread fiend had stayed his hand, And dove-eyed Peace had blessed the land, The hero sheathed the conquering wand, Which independence won; His valor made our country free, Secured our rights and liberty, Then let us celebrate with glee The birth of Washington. HE LEFT THE PLOUGH. He left the plough and furrowed soil Till independence crowned his toil, And then retired with laurelled brow; Like Rome's dictator to the plough. Then swell the tributary lay, To hail the hero's natal day; His fadeless glory lights the earth, And millions celebrate his birth. O Thou who didst the hero raise, Accept a grateful nation's praise; For while thy mercies we proclaim, With pride our Washington we name. CENTENNIAL ODE ON WASHINGTON. Sublimest strains of praise belong To our Almighty Lord, Who led our fathers o'er the flood, Fired with a holy flame, To build where heathen idols stood, An altar to his name, Who spreads their realms from sea to sea, Which countless charms adorn, And raised a chief to make it free When Washington was born. Sing to our God in loudest strain, No other king we own; No earthly monarch here shall reign, The King of kings alone. He to our lot a land assigned, His favored people's boast, And blest with gifts of various kind, The health-encircled coast. Let freemen swell the sounding lay, On the auspicious morn, One hundred years ago to-day, Our Washington was born. LAFAYETTE'S WELCOME. The banner of Liberty, proudly unfurled, Is waving in triumph o'er turret and dome, For the hero, whose fame has enlightened the world, Revisits a people who welcome him home. The hero, who, spurning the pleasures that wait On fortune and rank in the halls of the great, The foes of Columbia intrepidly met, Our national guest, is the brave Lafayette. He saw infant Liberty struggling for life, When clouds of despair had her prospect o'ercast, The tempest was raging, he courted the strife, His generous bosom was bared to the blast. Then welcome him, freemen! he succored our cause, With Washington fought for our rights and our laws; The foes of Columbia intrepidly met, Then hail the return of the brave Lafayette. A TRIBUTE TO LAFAYETTE. This tribute to the memory and virtues of Lafayette, was recited by William Wiley, Esq., at the Chatham-street chapel, in the city of New York, on the evening of the eighteenth of December, 1834, preparatory to a eulogy on the life and character of the distinguished patriot. What is true greatness? In the Eternal Mind 'T is wisdom, love, and potency combined; In man, his image, it is truth in thought, Embraced, beloved, and into action brought; In one bright spirit all these virtues met, And blessed the world with glorious Lafayette, Whose feelings, thoughts, and acts united, ran To one grand pointâthe happiness of man. No blemish stained the escutcheon which he bore; If he loved gloryâhe loved virtue more: Heir to a splendid name, rank, title, power, And princely fortuneâfrom the elysian bower Of youthful wedlock, which an Eden bloomed By breath of angel tenderness perfumed, He tore himself awayâat Freedom's call, In Freedom's cause resolved at stand or fall. From a voluptuous court, where all caressed, He flew to join her votaries in the West; Here, with a stripling's arm, he bared the blade, The drooping cause of Liberty to aid; Resolved for glory's dazzling goal to run, And share the prize with none but Washington. Was this not greatness?âTriumph or defeatâ The furious onsetâmasterly retreatâ Skill, courage, patience, conduct, and addressâ Yet great in allâtill crowned with bright success He saw our country free; with laurelled brow Beheld her God-like chief resume the plough; Then sought his much-loved, native land again, To beard the fiend Oppression in his den, Bearing a torch from Freedom's blazing shrine, Which lights the world, and will for ever shine. Whether beheld in Victory's brightest hour, Or as a fugitive from lawless power; In the dark cells of Olmutz, crushed with chains, Still not a spot his laurel chaplet stains. Freed by Napoleon's armsâe'en gratitude His love of truth and virtue ne'er subdued. With manly pride he princely honors spurned, And to his firesideâloved La Grangeâreturned. Was greatness his, whom cursed ambition fired To mount a throneâor Lafayette's, retired? But time rolled onâthe hero came once more, And millions hailed him âWelcome to our shore!â That was a triumph âmeet for gods to view, And men, like godsââwhat monarchs never knew. But oh! the moral grandeur of that hour, When introduced beneath our senate's dome, That solemn conclave hailed him âWelcome home!â Leaves human language destitute of power To do it justice. It was more sublime Than any scene upon the page of time. And when he saw the sages of the land, Convened to place in one deserving hand The reins of power, the car of state to guide, In peace or war, whatever fate betide; A chief installed without the vain parade Which dazzles vassals, when their king are made: Fired with the moral grandeur of the scene, With tear-drops gushing from an eye serene, He sawâhe heardâand, with high-throbbing breast, Pronounced Columbia's sons supremely blest. But lo! in France oppression reigns again, And Lafayette, at three-score years and ten, Plucks from the Bourbon brow the jewelled crown, While the weak despot, shrinking from his frown, Yields him the sceptre, flying in disgraceâ The last, the worst of that degenerate race! Millions of hearts, and hands, and voices, now Had placed upon the patriot's silvery brow That dazzling diademâbut he was yet Greater than monarchsâhe was Lafayette! On younger brows he placed the glittering thing, And swore allegiance to the new-made king: This was true greatnessâfor this act surpassed The loftiest stretch of thoughtâit was the lastâ And it approached so near the heavenly goal, Earth could no longer hold so pure a soul; But, filled with virtue, wisdom, truth, and love, 'T was called to wear a diadem above. We mourn him not on this august occasionâ We celebrate his heavenly coronation! WHEN THE LILY OF GALLIA. When the lily of Gallia first bloomed in our valley, 'T was planted by one we shall never forget; It was spotless and white, like the delicate light Which beamed from the eye of the young Lafayette. When the ever-green laurel we won in the quarrel By Washington's finger beside it was set, Oh, the beautiful cluster emitted a lustre Like that which now circles the brave Lafayette. A DIRGE ON THE DEATHS OF JOHN ADAMS AND THOMAS JEFFERSON, JULY 4, 1826. The strains of joy no longer float, Or thrill upon our raptured ears, But Sorrow wakes her saddest note, And millions are dissolved in tears. A nation, clad in sable weeds, The dark habiliments of grief; A nation famed for matchless deeds, Weeps for a father and a chief. Columbia mourns, though not bereft Of all which makes existence dear, For blessings, joys, and hopes, are left, Which brighten in affliction's tear. Yet still she mournsâfor they are gone, Whose wisdom raised her fame so high, Whose God-like acts her name adorn With honor that can never die; Who framed that bold, that dauntless chart, Which gave a mighty empire birth, Aroused to freedom every heart, And spread its influence through the earth: Who in her service labored, both, And asked no recompense but this, To watch her greatness in its growth, Promote her fame, and share her bliss. And Heaven vouchsafed to grant the boon 'Till half a century had passed, Until her sun had reached its noon, There to be fixed while time shall last. Then burst with joy, their mighty hearts, And set their raptured spirits free, So Sol, in flood of light, departs, And sets in glory's dazzling sea. In peace the reverend sages slept, Adorned with honors, crowned with years, And angels smiled, while nature wept, A silvery shower of sparkling tears. Then, freemen, mournâbut not as those Whose hopes are laid beneath the sod, For your lamented chiefs repose Upon the bosom of their God. Mourn for the worth which all admired, Now crowned with heavenly diadem, And be with emulation fired To live, to act, to die, like them. A MONODY, ON THE DEATHS OF THE EX-PRESIDENTS, JOHN ADAMS, AND THOMAS JEFFERSON, JULY 4, 1826. The mid-day peal of joy had rung, When Sol, in his car of glory, A radiant glance from the zenith flung, On a spot far-famed in story. He gazed on the scene, but sought in vain For that band of patriot sages, Whose deathless names alone remain, Emblazoned on History's pages. All, all were gone, but the Godlike THREE Revered by a grateful nation, And they were our Adams, our Carroll, and HE Who drafted the Declaration. He thought of the time, when in deep despair, Columbia's troops were receding, For millions were now rejoicing where Her heroes then lay bleeding! â'T is done!â he cried, âand this jubilee Shall long be remembered in story, For TWO of the patriot Godlike THREE, Shall depart in this blaze of glory.â He said, and amid the joy and mirth, (For the mandate had been given,) The spirit of Jefferson rose from earth, To meet its reward in heaven. He soared on high, to his place of rest, With cherubim attendants, And he smiling soared, for his country was blessed With freedom and independence. One glance of love was downward cast, Like a beam of celestial glory, O'er Quincy's reverend sage it passed, Renowned like himself, in story. He felt the ray, and his mighty heart Burst with the sweet emotion, 'T was the year and the day he had prayed to depart, In the fervor of pure devotion. Together they gained the elysium bower, By angels received with gladness, While Nature wept in a silvery shower, But not with tears of sadness. Together they toiled for their country's good, In her darkest hour of danger, Together the arm of oppression withstood, Each heart to fear a stranger. Together they soared to realms of bliss, In a world of fadeless splendor; Together their names shall live in this While Liberty has a defender. THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. This event was celebrated, in New York, on the 26th of November, 1830. The following ode (to the air of the Marsellaise Hymn) was printed during the procession, and distributed among the crowd, from a moveable stage. O'er regal domes, renowned in story, The trinal banner proudly waves, And France resumes the march of glory, Her gallant sons no longer slaves. With tyrants vainly had they pleaded, But when the press in thunder spoke, It burst their chains with lightning stroke, And peace and liberty succeeded. Then swell the choral strain To hail the blessed decree! Rejoice! rejoice! the press shall reign, And all the world be free! All hail! renowned chivalric nation! Land of the olive and the vine! Inspired with kindred emulation, Our bosoms glow with joy like thine! Columbia's grateful sons can never Forget, that in her darkest hour, She owed to Gallia's arm, the power To disenthrall her press for ever. Then swell the choral strain To hail the blessed decree! Rejoice! rejoice! the press shall reign, And all the world be free! The day which saw the sceptre shivered, And hailed Columbia truly free, From every hireling foe delivered, We consecrate to joy and thee. The day on which the British troops evacuated New York, November 25, 1783. For tyrants tremble now before thee, And a free press, the beacon light That burst upon Oppression's night, Has spread eternal glory o'er thee. Then swell the choral strain To hail the blessed decree! Rejoice! rejoice! the press shall reign, And all the world be free! Thy chartered rights, with lawless daring, Beneath oppressors' feet were trod, Till startled despots heard, despairing, The people's voice, the voice of God! Their sovereign will was loudly spoken; The press proclaimed it to the world! Till Freedom's ensign waved unfurled, And Gallia's galling chains were broken! Then swell the choral strain To hail the blessed decree! Rejoice! rejoice! the press shall reign, And all the world be free! Thy gallant band of youthful heroes, Roused by their bleeding country's prayers, Undaunted hurled on ruthless Neros, The vengeance due to crimes like theirs! Too late they see their fatal error, Their hireling guards by thousands fall, The press resigns its types for ball, And despots fly the scene in terror! Then swell the choral strain To hail the blessed decree! Rejoice! rejoice! the press shall reign, And all the world be free! Their deeds shall live in deathless story, And song preserve their chaplets green; Yet still the brightest rays of glory Circle one Godlike brow serene. 'T is his whose youthful valor aided Columbia's cause, when hostile bands Were laying waste her fairest lands, And all her blooming hopes had faded! Then swell the choral strain To hail the blessed decree! Rejoice! rejoice! the press shall reign, And all the world be free! Immortal Lafayette! we hail thee, The friend of equal rights on earth, Though servile tools of kings assail thee, Columbia knows and owns thy worth. Thou first of heroes, best of sages, The glorious chaplet thou hast won, Disciple of our Washington, Shall bloom, like his, for endless ages. Then swell the choral strain To hail the blessed decree! Rejoice! rejoice! the press shall reign, And all the world be free! THE EXILED HARPER. âFriendless exile! old and hoary, Banish sorrow and complaint, Wake thy harp to Erin's glory, Sing the lay of Erin's saint.â 'T was Saint Patrick's festal morning, When I met the man of grief; On his cheek the tear was burning, Withered was the shamrock's leaf. âNo!â exclaimed the aged stranger, âErin's glory is no more, Hordes of bloody tyrants range herâ Freedom flies Hibernia's shore. âShackled with the yoke of Britain, Doomed to vassalage and chains, Be her name nor sung nor written Till Oppression fly her plains. âBright she shines in ancient legends, When her sons awoke the lay; Ere her peaceful, verdant regions Groaned beneath ambition's sway. âAsk me not to sing of glory; For by all the griefs I bear, By these scattered locks so hoary, By our holy saint I swear: âErin's harp shall ever slumber, Never whisper through the vale, Never breathe a tuneful number Pregnant with dishonor's tale. âFallen are the chiefs of Erin, Fallen in their country's cause, Green their tombs are now appearing, There her weeping daughters pause. âWhen the night-blast scours the mountains, When it murmurs through the groves, Mournful, by the dusky fountains, Emmet's shade in sadness moves. âSee! it points to cursed Oppression! Hark! its shrieks arrest the gale! Hurl your thunders on aggression, Bid our warriors fill the vale! âVeterans, rouse! and save your nation! Hark! the trumpet calls to arms!â âStranger! calm this perturbation, Here no martial trump alarms.â In his eye, where fire was beaming, Now appeared the tear of griefâ âNo,â he sighed, âI was but dreaming, Erin groans without relief. âBut I'll feed the fond reflection, Days of other months review, Call again to recollection, Dear companions whom I knew. âNow oppressed by power and violence, Not a harpstring breathes a tone, Wrapt in sorrow, thought, and silence, Erin's hapless minstrel mourns. âSing of Erin's glory! madness! Would our saint accept the lay? Noâdevote to silent sadness This our patron's festive day.â THE IRISH ORPHAN. CITIZEN. Irish maiden, whither fly you? Whence the moisture on your cheek? Danger here shall not come nigh youâ Tell me what, and whom, you seek. IRISH GIRL. Pity, sir, a hapless stranger, Friendless on a foreign shore! Much, alas! I fear of dangerâ I'm from Erin, just come o'er. CITIZEN. Where 's your kindred, friend, protector? Sure you ventured not alone? Had you not some kind director? Father, brotherâhave you none? IRISH GIRL. Yes I haveâI had a brother, Once a widowed parent's stay; Yes, alas! I had a mother Both by fate were snatched away! CITIZEN. Then, an orphan, unprotected, You have left your native isle, To Columbia's shore directed, Where you meet no kindred smile? IRISH GIRL. Noâa parent, and a brother, With me from oppression run; Death deprived me of my motherâ Cruel Britons pressed her son. Under Freedom's banner sailing, Just in view of Freedom's shore, Brightning prospects Hope was hailing, Whispering future bliss in store: When we spied the flag of Britain, Where foreboding fancy read Some impending evil writtenâ How my bosom beat with dread! First a shot our course arrested, Then their slaves disgraced our deck, Fathers from their children wrested! Son from parent'sâsister's neck! âSpare!â I cried, âoh, spare my brother! Spare him for a parent's sake!â âSave! oh, save him!â cried my mother, âOr his sister's heart will break!â Smiling pirates! they but mocked us! Laughed at fond affection's grief! And with brutal language shocked us, While we wept without relief! But when from us they departed, Shrieks of anguish pierced the air! Then my mother, broken-hearted Fell, the victim of despair! Pity, then, a hapless stranger, Friendless on a foreign shore! Oh, protect a maid from danger, Who for comfort looks no more. CITIZEN. Yes, fair daughter of oppression! Exile from Hibernia's plains, Victim of that cursed aggression Which the flag of freedom stains: Here I swear to be thy brother; See a sister in my wife; Find a parent in my mother, I'll protect thee with my life. BOLIVAR'S LAST WORDS. âI pity and forgive.â Ye powers, from each oppressor, Preserve my country's wreath, And if my death can bless her, Oh, then I welcome death. Though malice wield her scourge, E'en when I cease to live, Here on the grave's terrific verge, âI pity and forgive.â I planted freedom's banner Where tyranny had reigned, And heard the glad hosanna For rights our arms regained; But now they trample on my heart, Yet ere I cease to live, Though in my soul I feel the smart, âI pity and forgive.â ODES ON THE NAVAL VICTORIES. WAR OF 1812. CONSTITUTION AND GUERRIERE. Hark! 'twas the trumpet of victory sounded! Welcome the strain to a freeman so dear; See, with a halo of glory surrounded, Hull, our first hero, in triumph appear! Vainly the foeman his prowess had vaunted, Proudly deriding our infantile fleet; Hull met the boaster with courage undaunted, Dacres as resolute scorned to retreat. Short was the dreadful fray On that eventful day, Freedom's proud eagle still hovered on high; Bright gleamed the crosslet too, While fierce the volleys flew, Shaking the ocean and rending the sky. Short was the contest, but dreadful the slaughter, Long shall Britannia lament for her tars. Death held his carnival on the deep water, Scattered with carnage and fragments of spars, Still like a tempest the bold Constitution Deluged the former with ruin and blood; Whelmed the proud warrior in horrid confusion, Till she lay, sparless, a log on the flood. Still she prolonged the fray On that destructive day, Still Freedom's banner was waving on high; Low gleamed the cross in view, While fierce the volleys flew, Shaking the ocean and rending the sky. Short was the contestâthe warrior surrendered, Covered with carnage and streaming with gore; Tenderest aid to the wounded rendered, Foemen once vanquished are foemen no more. Hail, then, the hero, who, covered with glory, Humbled the pride of our arrogant foe; Long may his name be emblazoned in story, Long may his laurels continue to grow. Then shout aloud his name, And loud the deed proclaimâ Hull taught Britannia's red cross to descend; Hull led the glorious wayâ Hull fought and won the day, Victory crowns him, and freemen commend. WASP AND FROLIC. Awake the bugle's martial voice, In loud triumphant strain; Columbia's sons again rejoice For victory on the main! Another chieftain of our choiceâ The brave intrepid Jones, Claims our lays, To his praise We wake the clarion's tones. Indignant at the wrongs we bore, From British pride and hate, He, fearless, left Columbia's shore, To try the battle's fate; And soon the cannon's mingled roar Announced the foe engagedâ Side by side, On the tide, The dreadful fight they waged. The horrid din of battle swelled, As o'er the watery field, An equal course the vessels held, Resolving ne'er to yield. Attempts at boarding still repulsed, And still the fire was poured; Bright it broke, Through the smoke, While loud the cannons roared. The vessels closeâand hark! the crash That rends their groaning planks; The foeman's fire has ceased to flash, For death has thinned his ranks; And naught availed his valor rash, He yields to gallant Jonesâ To whose praise Wake our lays In victory's richest tones. UNITED STATES AND MACEDONIAN. The banner of Freedom high floated unfurled, While the silver tipped surges in low homage curled, Flashing bright round the bow of a ship under sail, In fight, like the tempestâin speed, like the gale. She bears our country's name, She builds our country's fame, The bold United States disdains to yield or fly; Her motto is âGloryâwe conquer or die.â All canvass expanded the gale to embrace, The ship cleared for action, still nearing the chase; The foeman in viewâevery bosom beats high, All eager for conquest, or ready to die. Columbia's gallant tars, Who sail beneath her stars, Shall ne'er be known to yieldâshall ne'er ignobly fly; Their motto is âGloryâwe conquer or die.â Still rapidly lessens the distance between, Till the gay-floating streamers of Britain are seen; Till our quick-sighted chief could with rapture espy, The cross, like a meteor, gleaming on high. To gild our country's name, To rival Hull in fame, The brave Decatur now resolves the fight to tryâ His motto is âGloryâwe conquer or die.â Now Havoc stands ready with optics of flame, And battle-hounds strain on the start for the game; The blood-demons rise on the surge for their prey, While Pity, dejected, awaits the dread fray. But Freedom's gallant sons, Now stationed at their guns, Remember Freedom's wrongs, and smother Pity's sigh; Their motto is âGloryâwe conquer or die.â Now the lightning of battle gleams horribly red While a tempest of iron, and a hailstorm of lead, Like a flood on the foe was so copiously poured, That his mizzen and topmasts soon went by the board. Still fight Columbia's tars Beneath the stripes and stars, For still their country's flag is proudly floating high, Their motto is âGloryâwe conquer or die.â The contest continued with horrible roar, The demons of vengeance still feasting on gore; 'Till more than a hundred of Britain's brave sons, Lay bleeding on deck by the side of their guns: When low the cross descends, And quick the battle ends, The Macedonian yields, her streamers kiss the wave; Our motto is âGloryâwe conquer to save.â Let Britain no longer lay claim to the seas, For the trident of Neptune is ours if we please; While Hull, and Decatur, and Jones are our boast, In vain their huge navy may threaten our coast. They gild Columbia's name, They build Columbia's fame; And to revenge our wrongs, to battle eager fly; Their motto is âGloryâwe conquer or die.â CONSTITUTION AND JAVA. Yankee tars! come, join the chorus, Shout aloud the patriot strain; Freedom's flag, again victorious, Floats triumphant o'er the main. Hail the gallant Constitution! Hull immortalized her name; Bainbridge, round it in profusion Pours the golden blaze of fame. Scarce had Fame her Hull rewarded, Ere intrepid Bainbridge rose, Eager while the world applauded, To subdue his country's foes. Hail the gallant Constitution, &amp;c. Hull, on board the Constitution, Sank his foe beneath the flood; Fired with equal resolution, Bainbridge sought the scene of blood. Hail the gallant Constitution, &amp;c. Lambert met him on the Java, Fierce the hot contention roseâ Like the streams of Etna's lava, Fell our vengeance on the foes Hail the gallant Constitution, &amp;c. Neptune shunned the fierce commotion, Saw his realm with carnage spread, Saw our fire illume the ocean, Covered with the floating dead. Hail the gallant Constitution, &amp;c. Twice had Time his glass inverted, While the strife deformed the flood, Ere the fiend of death, diverted, Ceased to glut on human blood. Hail the gallant Constitution, &amp;c. See, our foe, upon the billow, Floats a wreck without a sparâ Lowly lies on ocean's pillow, Many a brave and gallant tar. Hail the gallant Constitution, &amp;c. Hark! his lee gun speaks submission, Bid our vengeful tars forbearâ Mercy views the foe's condition, Sees a bleeding brother there. Hail the gallant Constitution, &amp;c. Man the boats! the foe, confounded, Yields to our superior fire; Board the prize! relieve the wounded! Ere in anguish they expire. Hail the gallant Constitution, &amp;c. Ah! the fight was hard contested, Groaning there an hundred bleed, Sixty-nine has death arrested, From their floating prisons freed. Hail the gallant Constitution, &amp;c. Clear the wreck! she can not swim, boys; See! she follows the Guerriere! Now your cans fill to the brim, boys, Sing our navy's bright career. Hail the gallant Constitution, &amp;c. Toast the heroes famed in story, Hull, Decatur, Rodgers, Jones; Bainbridge, chief in naval glory, Smiling Freedom joyfully owns. Hail the gallant Constitution! Hull immortalized her name; Bainbridge, round it in profusion Pours the golden blaze of fame. HORNET AND PEACOCK. Rejoice! rejoice! Fredonia's sons rejoice! And swell the loud trumpet in patriotic strain; Your choice, your choice, fair Freedom is your choice, Then celebrate her triumphs on the main. For the trident of Neptune, long by Britain wielded, At length to Fredonia reluctantly yielded. Then for Hull, Decatur, Jones, And for Bainbridge, swell the tones, While the ready hand of Fame Bright emblazons every nameâ Brave Lawrence, gallant Lawrence, now is shouted with acclaim. Huzza, huzza, huzza, huzza, huzza, boys, Free is our soil, and the ocean shall be free; Our tars, shall Mars protect beneath our stars, And Freedom's eagle hover o'er the sea. Attend, attend, ye gallant tars attend, While your deeds are recounted in patriotic song; Ascend, ascend, your banners high ascend, And your cannon the loud chorus still prolong. First, the bold Constitution led the path of glory, The gallant little Wasp then added to the story; Soon a brighter glory 'waits, The renowned United Statesâ For she gave Columbia's fleet, A new frigate that she beat; While the famed Constitution sunk another in the deep. Huzza, huzza, huzza, huzza, huzza, boys, Free is our soil, and the ocean shall be free; Our tars shall Mars protect beneath our stars, And Freedom's eagle hover o'er the sea. Again, again, Columbia's flag again Triumphantly floats where Britannia's used to soar; In vain the main has owned the Peacock's reign, Her gaudy rainbow honors are no more! For Lawrence taught the Hornet so fiercely to assail her, That all her boasted prowess in fight could not avail her; But she ended her career, Like the Java and Guerriere; For the Hornet's sting was plied Till the sea, with blushes dyed, Its tyrant's fifth defeat in its bosom sought to hide. Huzza, huzza, huzza, huzza, huzza, boys, Free is our soil, and the ocean shall be free; Our tars shall Mars protect beneath our stars, And Freedom's eagle hover o'er the sea. Unite, unite, Columbia's sons, unite, And hurl on aggressors the tempest they provoke, The fight is right, then raise your sabres bright, And Britons soon shall tremble at the stroke. The foe's on our coast! put your mountain-oaks in motion, Fly to the main, for your wrongs were on the ocean; There in a flood of fire, Every tar shall breathe his ire; His motto, while he fights, Be âFree trade and sailors' rights,â Till even-handed Justice every injury requites. Huzza, huzza, huzza, huzza, huzza, boys, Free is our soil, and the ocean shall be free; Our tars shall Mars protect beneath our stars, And Freedom's eagle hover o'er the sea. ENTERPRISE AND BOXER. Through the gloom of despondence, bright glory appears, And scatters again on the ocean its splendor; Hark! Freedom's loud clarion proclaims to the sphere, The names of more heroes who die to defend her; On Lawrence's bier, Yet glistened her tear, When this full sounding chorus saluted her ear: No tyrant shall ever rule over that flood, Which Lawrence and Burrows have stained with their blood. Delighted, she listened, and learned from the strain, That her flag was victorious while Britain's descended: And though her tears fell for the fate of the slain, She gloried in sons who so nobly defended: Who in Liberty's cause, With Heaven's applause, Had died in defence of their country and laws. Now vainly shall tyrants lay claim to that flood, Which Lawrence and Burrows have stained with their blood. Young Burrows, unknown on the annals of Fame, Arose and laid claim to a chaplet of laurel; Fought the Boxer, enveloped in sulphur and flame, Till the victory he gained, though he died in the quarrel. On victory's breast, The hero shall rest, While his spirit aspires to the realms of the blest. And ne'er shall a tyrant rule over that flood, Which Lawrence and Burrows have stained with their blood. Then fill up your goblets, bid sorrow adieu, The heroes who fell are encircled with glory; While music inspires, let us toast the brave crew, Who survive the hot contest to tell us the story; The fight they'll ne'er shun, For with gun matched to gun, In triumph we only count six to their one. No tyrant shall ever rule over that flood, Which Lawrence and Burrows have stained with their blood. PERRY AND M'DONOUGH: OR, ERIE AND CHAMPLAIN The engagement on Lake Erie, between Commodores Perry and Barclay, occurred September 10, 1813, and that of Lake Champlain, between M'Donough and Downie, Sept. 11, 1814. Hail to the day which arises in splendor, Shedding the lustre of victory far! Long shall its glory illume September, Which twice beheld freemen the victors in war. Roused by the spirit of heaven-born Freedom, Perry her lightning pours over the lake; His falchion a meteor glitters to lead them, And swift on the foemen in thunders they break. Loud swells the cannon's roar, Round Erie's sounding shore, Answered in volleys by musketry's voice; Till Britain's cross descends, And the haughty foe bendsâ Victory! glory! Columbians, rejoice! Hail to the day which in splendor returning, Lights us to conquest and glory again; Time told a yearâstill the war-torch was burning, And threw its red ray on the waves of Champlain; Roused by the spirit that conquered for Perry, Dauntless M'Donough advanced to the fray; Instant the glory that brightened Lake Erie, Burst on Champlain with the splendor of day Loud swells the cannon's roar On Plattsburgh's bloody shore, Britons retreat from the tempest of war; Prevost deserts the field, Sir George Prevost, commander of the British land-forces, made a hasty retreat after the capture of Commodore Downie's fleet. While the gallant ships yieldâ Victory! glory! Columbians, huzza! Hail to the day which, recorded in story, Lives the bright record of unfading fame! Long shall Columbians, inspired by its glory, Hail its returning with joyous acclaim. Victory scattered profusely the laurel, Over our heroes, on land and on flood; Britain, astonished, relinquished the quarrel, Peace saw her olive arise from the blood. Now cannons cease to roar, Round Freedom's peaceful shore, Silent and hushed is the war-bugle's voice; Let festive joys increase In the sunshine of peace, Peace gained by victory! Freemen, rejoice! SARATOGA AND MORGIANNA. Come, banish all your petty jars, And shout your joy in loud huzzas, In honor of Columbia's tars, Whose valor ne'er shall fail her; Let echo answer to the strain, And pass the tidings o'er the main, That British pride, Which we deride, Again is humbled on the tide, By Freedom's gallant sailor. Once Saratoga swelled the song, As Britain will remember long, Burgoyne with seven thousand strong, In fight could not avail her; Now Saratoga on the main, Has shown that Britains claim is vain, To rule the sea By nature freeâ 'T is what shall never, never be, Says every Yankee sailor. This Saratoga you shall hear, Was fitted out a privateer, And manned by tars unknown to fear, From danger never paler; To die or conquer all agreedâ To die or valiantly succeed! To nobly die, But never fly While George's cross was waving high, 'T was like a Yankee sailor. They hoisted sail, and cruised afar, To aid their country in the war, And many a valiant British tar Has reason to bewail her; They fought and captured all they met, While Britons vainly fume and fret; Each gallant prize In safety lies, While far to sea for more she flies, To enrich a Yankee sailor. At length they spy a worthier mark, To try their little, gallant barkâ Behold a ship of war! and, hark! They arrogantly hail her! The Saratoga quick replies, In language that astounds the skies; While Freedom's sons Still serve their guns, 'Till called âaway,â each boarder runs, And each, a Yankee sailor. The foe has eighteen guns, or more, The Saratoga only four: Away! my lads, and board once more, And fiercely still assail her. Huzza, huzza, boys! see, she strikes! Now board your prize without your pikes, And succor those No longer foes Whose generous blood in duty flows, And save a brother sailor. TYPOGRAPHICAL ODES. HAIL TO THE ART. Hail to the art! whose effulgence has brightened The darkness that shrouded, for ages, the world; Long shall her sons, by its lustre enlightened, Wave the bright banner which Freedom unfurled. Dark was the human mind, And hoodwinked reason blind, While Tyranny gave to his war-steeds the rein; Then Faust arose to bless, And gave to man the press, Free as the billows of Neptune's domain. Then Liberty roused from the slumber of ages, And taught a new nation to rise in the West; While History, smiling, unfolded her pages, And showed the bright name of Columbia impressed. Long fought her patriot band, Blood flowed around the land, Till liberty triumphed over tyranny's powers; The light which printing shed, Like Sol's effulgence spread, And glory, with bright Independence, was ours. Beaming with splendor, from Liberty's altar, Ascended the flame which our art had kept bright, When demons united again to assault her, Demolish her shrine, and extinguish its light. Hark! trumpets sound alarms; Drums, bugles, call to armsâ Arouse, freemen, rouse! to the field like your sires! Soon shall the foeman yield, Or fly the embattled field, For Liberty triumphs while Printing inspires. Twice have our arms Independence protected, And twice haughty Britain has yielded the fight; Long shall our valor and rights be respected, Long shall the blaze of our glory be bright. Then hail the heaven-born art, Which first improved the heart, And ransomed the mind from the thraldom of sense! Long shall Columbia bless The free unshackled Press, Liberty's Ãgis, and Virtue's defence. WHILE AROUND THE FESTIVE BOARD. WRITTEN FOR THE CELEBRATION OF A SOCIETY OF PRINTERS. While around the festive board The son of Freedom throng, And bid her praises rise In patriotic song; Ye brethren of our heaven-born art Unite to hail the day; Let joy expand each patriot heart, Each tongue assist the lay. Arise, 't is Freedom's natal morn, Ye sons of Faust, Faust the inventor of the art of printing. arise! For ever swear to guard The dearly-purchased prize. Mankind in darkness groped, Their blind and erring way, Deep veiled in Gothic shades, With scarce a glimpse of day, Till Faust arose and bid our art Illume their darkened mind; Then independence fired the heart Which knowledge had refined. Arise, 't is Freedom's natal morn, Ye sons of Faust, arise! For ever swear to guard The dearly-purchased prize. But long they sought in vain To win the heavenly prize; Oppression's lengthened reign Their ardent wish denies, Till o'er our hard-earned western soil He dared his sceptre wield; 'T was then our sires, with blood and toil Gained freedom and the field. Arise, 't is Freedom's natal morn, Ye sons of Faust, arise! For ever swear to guard The dearly-purchased prize. Then smiling peace was ours, And every earthly bliss, Till Europe's treacherous powers Betrayed us with a kiss. But, like our fathers, now we'll rise, Our birthrights to maintainâ Swear by the God of earth and skies No tyrant here shall reign. Arise, 't is Freedom's natal morn, Ye sons of Faust, arise! For ever swear to guard The dearly-purchased prize. Then let the foe advance, The press shall still inspire, To wield the missive lance, Or guide the vengeful fire; And here we swear, when Freedom calls We'll not refuse to die; The foe shall see beneath our balls The words in italics are technical terms peculiar to the art. His columns fall in pi. Arise, 't is Freedom's natal morn, Ye sons of Faust, arise! For ever swear to guard The dearly-purchased prize. Long ere a foreign flag O'ertops Columbia's stripes, We'll forge our sticks to arms, To balls convert our types. We'll never flinch, but give them chase, Display our mystic stars; Our eagle still shall hold his place, And hurl the shafts of Mars. Arise, 't is Freedom's natal morn, Ye sons of Faust, arise! For ever swear to guard The dearly-purchased prize. Who threats with foreign rule Our shooting-sticks defy; We'll have a brush with all, Before we take the lie. We'll hush the English lion's roar, French cannon we'll compose, The form of tyranny beat o'er, And hot-press all our foes. Arise, 't is Freedom's natal morn, Ye sons of Faust, arise! For ever swear to guard The dearly-purchased prize. Long may we keep the morn, Which gave our nation birth, And when, at length, our works Are finished here on earthâ May we our Heavenly Author meet, (Our earthly forms forsook,) And each become a perfect sheet In his eternal book. Till then, on Freedom's natal morn, Let joyful pÃ¦ans rise: To-day for us was born The goddess of the skies. PRINTERS' ODE. From the crystalline courts of the temple of light, The dove-eye of Mercy to earth was directed, Where mortals were grov'ling, deep shrouded in night; For passion was worshipped and wisdom rejected: Immersed in each ill Of corrupted free-will, Yet Mercy was patient, and Patience slept still: For infinite Love had his banner unfurled, And the precepts of wisdom were preached to the world. But haughty Ambition extended his reign, And wielded the sceptre of magic delusion, Held Reason enshackled in Tyranny's chain, And governed by knowledge and learning's exclusion. With mitre and hood, Superstition and blood, Corruption and vice deluged earth like a flood; The blood-crimsoned banner of war was unfurled, And knowledge and science were swept from the world. Deep locked in the shrine of antiquity's lore, The Scriptures of light were withheld unexpounded, A counterfeit Peter still guarded the door, And the seekers of truth were by error confounded. Omnipotence sawâ Bade Delusion withdraw, And ordained that our art should promulgate his law. Then Genius his fetters at Tyranny hurled, And printing appeared to enlighten the world. The blush of Aurora now lighted the east, And banished the darkness of mystical terror: Man sprang from the shrine of the mystical beast, While prejudice owned and relinquished his error, The truth was received, Admired and believed, And ours is the art which the blessing achieved: For now was the banner of Wisdom unfurled, And printing arose, like a sun, to the world. The sage of Genoa, whose emulous soul, By a flash from our art, glowed with new inspiration; In brilliant perspective saw glory's bright goal, And enrolled a new world on the page of creation. With high-swelling breast, Still onward he pressed, Till Eden's bright regions appeared in the West; Each clime saw the canvass of Europe unfurled, While printing taught Commerce to polish the world. But the sons of the West to more glory were born, And to us shall proud Europe the laurel surrender; For though hers was the blushing effulgence of morn, Yet ours is the noon of meridian splendor; For Heaven decreed That Columbia be freed, And printing and valor accomplished the deed. The banner of war was by Justice unfurled, And freedom by printing proclaimed to the world. Our standard the eagle of liberty bears, His eyes, like the stars that surround him, resplendent, While the olive asks peace, every arrow declares, Columbia for ever shall be independent; For freedom is ours, Nor shall Europe's mad powers A feather e'er filch from our bird as he towers; And while a free PRESS thus enlightens the world, The banner of Liberty ne'er shall be furled. PRINTING AND INDEPENDENCE. When, wrapped in folds of papal gloom, Dark Superstition awed the world, Consigned fair Knowledge to the tomb, And Error's sable flag unfurled; Earth heard the mandate from the skiesâ âLet there be lightâgreat ART, arise!â Young Science wiped her tears and smiled, And infant Genius plumed his wing; The arts assemble round the child, And all this glowing chorus singâ Rise, sun of science! quick, arise! And lend thy light to darkened eyes. Our art arose, and man had light, The clouds of superstition fled, The fiend of ignorance took his flight, And Error hid his hateful head; Whilst swelled this chorus to the skiesâ âOur art shall live, and Freedom rise.â The goddess, who for ages past Had wept beneath despotic night, Her cankering fetters burst at last, And claimed the charter of her right, While men and seraphs joined this strainâ âPrinting shall live, and Freedom reign.â Hail, Freedom! hail, celestial guest! Oh, never from thy sons depart; Thine be the empire of the West, Thy temple every freeman's heart; The art of printing gave thee birth, And brightens still thy reign on earth. Arise, ye favored sons of light, Professors of our heaven-born ARTâ And in the chorus all unite, While joy expands the throbbing heart; âThe art of printing shall endure, âAnd Independence be secure.â AWAKE THE LOUD TRUMPET. Awake the loud trumpet, 'tis Freedom invites, Let heroes respond to the strain; The olive of peace with the laurel unites, And music swells sweet o'er the plain. Thy birth, Independence, by freemen be kept, Till Tyranny's banner be furled, Till despots have bled, where their victims have wept, And Freedom has spread o'er the world. When dark Superstition had fettered the mind, And Reason in bondage was bound, The goddess descended to ransom mankind, And Genius arose from the ground. The Press she established, a pillar of fire, (While Night's sable curtain was furled), Its splendor bade mystic Delusion retire, And Printing gave light to the world. The daring Columbus his canvass unfurled, A nation arose in the West, The storehouse of Europe, a mart for the world, A home for the poor and oppressed. Here Freedom's bright temple effulgent shall shine, Her flag o'er its turrets unfurled, Our arms have twice saved it, 't will never decline While Printing gives light to the world. PRINTERS' JUBILEE Hark! 'twas the trumpet of Freedom that sounded, Millions of voices respond to the strain, Hailing the day when an empire was founded, Firm as our mountains, and free as the main! Brightly the star of its glory is beamingâ Loudly the pÃ¦ans of gladness arise! Gayly our star-spangled banners are streaming; Proudly our cannon are shaking the skies. 'T is Freedom's jubilee, Then join ye brave and free, Hail its return, independent and blest! Wake music's sweetest voice, Long may we thus rejoice! Hail to Columbia, the queen of the West! Dark was the gloom which her temple surrounded, Sad were the sighs that exhausted her breath, When, from its deep-vaulted roof, first resounded, The soul-stirring words, âIndependence or death!â Franklin, the pride of our art and the nation, Fixed on the charter of glory his seal, Freemen confirmed it, with loud acclamation, Heaven has sanctioned the solemn appeal. Sons of the brightest art Heaven can to man impart, Join in the chorusâour country is blestâ This is her Jubilee, Long shall her sons be free! Hail to Columbia, the queen of the West! Long was the struggle for freedom and glory; Fierce was the conflict our fathers sustained; Bright are their actions emblazoned in story: Long may we guard what their valor obtained. Hail to the art which such zeal could awaken! Long may it flourish, their sons to inspire; Freedom for ever the world had forsaken, Had not the press been âa pillar of fire.â Sons of the brightest art Heaven can to man impart, Join in the chorusâour country is blestâ This is her jubilee, Long may her sons be free; Hail to Columbia, the queen of the West! SONS OF FAUST. Sons of Faust, to whom belong Hearts and arms for freedom strong, Festive rites, and patriot song, Join in revelry! Raise the tributary lay, 'T is Columbia's natal day, Let each heart be light and gay, Heirs of liberty! Banish hence each petty feud. Let no selfish care intrude, 'T is the hour for gratitude, Social mirth and glee! While the sparkling rubies swim, Round each mantling goblet's brim, Quaff them ere their light be dim, Drink to liberty! Think what cause for joy is our, In this land of fruits and flowers, Splendid towns, and shady bowers, Blessed with liberty! Freed from sceptre, crown, and throne, Independence is our own, Never, but to Heaven alone, Will we bend the knee! Peace and plenty, through the land, Scatter joys on every hand, Bidding grateful hearts expand, On our jubilee! Hark the cannon's martial roar, Loud proclaims from shore to shore, That Columbia's sons adore Heaven-born liberty! We who boast the matchless art Which can light and truth impart, Let us all, with hand and heart, Keep the jubilee! 'T is our ART, and that alone, Makes the worth of freedom known, While admiring millions own, That has made them free! What inspired our sires to brave Ocean's rough, tempestuous wave, Seeking freedom, or a grave, Death, or liberty? 'T was the PRESS, a beacon-light, Beaming on their mental sight, Led them through that gloomy night, O'er the stormy sea! This sustained them in the field, This compelled the foe to yield, This is freedom's sword and shield, This proclaims us free! Let us, then, our joy express, For the blessings we possess, While a free unshackled PRESS Guards our liberty! ART OF PRINTING. When o'er proud Tiber's flood Fair Science reared her dome, And Greece had lent her arts To gild imperial Rome; Ambitious Genius aimed her flight To seek unknown renown, But, veiled in sable shades of night, She sunk bewildered down; For fate to them denied the art Which gives to knowledge birth, Refines the human heart, And scatters bliss on earth. No soft refinements graced Or harmonized the mind, For maddening war's career Left calmer joys behind; The social ties which life endear Their thoughts could ne'er engage; The sympathetic smile and tear Were lost in battle's rage: For fate to them denied the art Which gives to knowledge birth, Refines the human heart, And scatters bliss on earth. Time told a thousand years On his eventful page, When Faust, at length, appears To bless the happy age; His plastic hand lends genius wings, Bids wisdom proudly soar, And infant learning joyful springs With powers unknown before. His was the heaven-descended art To give fair knowledge birth, To mend the human heart, And civilize the earth. The sun of science rose, And chased the clouds of night; While wondering realms surveyed, Astonished at the sightâ The social arts, in wisdom's train, With love and peace advance, Teach man to feel his fellow's pain, A brother's joy enhance. Ours is the heaven-descended art To give fair knowledge birth, To mend the human heart, And civilize the earth. Hail, art of arts! all hail! Thy praises mock the lyre; To reach the boundless theme, Its tones in vain aspire; But grateful hearts, who feel the bliss Thy magic power bestows, Respond to every strain like this, How dull soe'er it flows: Ours is the heaven-descended art, To give fair knowledge birth, To mend the human heart, And civilize the earth.

All the sisters so caress him.

What are these, So strange in their attire, yet formed to please; That look not like the belles of gay Broadway, And yet are near it? Ladies, if I may So far presume, I beg that you'll command me In anything. You seem to understand me! Mortal or not, you know what I am saying, By each at once her taper finger laying Upon her lips. As females you appear, And yet your silence baffles that idea. 1st Ed. Speak if you can! What are you? Why demur? Clio. All hail the Mirror's senior editor! Tha. All hail to thee, whose fame shall long exist! Eut. A thousand names are added to thy list! Mel. All hail to thee, who shall be rich as CrÅsus! 2d Ed. Why do you start, good sir, at what should please us? [To the Muses.] Are ye fantastical, I fain would know? Or that indeed which outwardly ye show? You greet my partner, here, with present fee, And great prediction: why not speak to me, Who neither beg nor fear your love or hate? All. Hail! lesser than thy partner, yet more great! Clio. Thou shalt have fame that ne'er can fade nor fail, All. So all hail Morris, Fay, and Willis, hail! 1st Ed. Stay, ye imperfect speakers! tell me more. I know that I am senior editor; But as to fame, and wealth, and all the rest, The thousand names which you have just expressed, Stands not within the prospect of belief, No more than to be rich as Lydia's chief. How know you this? or why here, after dark, Stop you our way in this triangled Park, With such prophetic greeting in our path? [They vanish. 2d Ed. The earth hath bubbles, as the water hath, And these are of them. Whither did they fly? 1st Ed. Into the air, or theatre, just by; Would they had staid, and told their story out. 2d Ed. Were such things here, as we do speak about? Or have we breathed exhilarating gas, And merely dreamed that such things came to pass? 1st Ed. Thy fame shall still increase. 2d Ed. Thy wealth shall grow. 1st Ed. And reputation: went it not so? 2d Ed. To the self-same tune and words. Whom have we here? Enter Collector, in haste. Col. The news of my success will charm thine ear; One thousand new subscribers swell our list, Which still increases, and they all insist On paying in advance. There 's the amount, Which you will find correct, sir, if you count. 2d Ed. What! can their words be true? [Aside. 1st Ed. Sir, you are kind. [Musing. Thanks for your painsâthe greatest is behind. Wealthy as CrÅsus! the hope within me stirs, Our children's children may be editors! Two truths are toldâthe one a golden factâ As happy prologues to the swelling act. 2d Ed. Look, how our partner's rapt! 1st Ed. Come what, come may, Time and the hour run through the roughest day. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The Battery. Evening. Enter the nine Muses. Clio. Speak, sister, speak! is the deed done? Tha. Long agoâlong ago; 'T is volume NINE, and number one. Era. Great acts are seldom slow, Nor single; new ideas on former wait, The brightest thoughts the fastest propagate. CHORUS. Many more volumes must this one ensue; New pictures will abound, And elegance surround, As if in plates were found Propagation too. Clio. He mustâ Tha. He shallâ Eut. He will spill ink a flood, And labor hard to make his title good. Chorus. He must, he shall, he will, &amp;c. Terps. Now let us dance. Tha. Agreed, Eut. Agreed. Chorus. We should rejoice when books succeed. Clio. When poets woo, what should we do? When Freedom's voice in thunder Rends tyrants' chains asunder, And fills the world with wonder, What should we do? Chorus. Rejoiceâwe should rejoice. Enter Apollo, in a rage. Tha. How now, Apollo! what's the matter now? There seems to be a cloud upon thy brow. Apol. Have I not reason, meddlers as you are, Saucy and overbold? How did you dare To trade and traffic, after dark, With Fay and Morris in the Park, And I, the leader of your choir, âThe bright-haired master of the lyre,â Was never called to bear my part, Or show the glory of our art? But make amends now: get you gone, And meet me there to-morrow morn; From thence we'll go to Clinton hall, Where I expect you, one and all; Your vessels and your spells provide, Your charms, and everything beside. I'm for the air; this night I'll spend, To show that I'm the Mirror's friend. Apollo hands Terpsichore into the car of a balloon just then inflated; the cord is cut, and they slowly ascend, singing:â Now we go, and now we fly, Sweet Terpsichore and I; Oh, what a dainty pleasure's this! To sail in the air, Along with the fair; To sing, to toy, to dance, and kiss. Over woods, railroads, and mountains, Over seas, canals, and fountains, Over steeples, towers, and turrets, We fly by night o'er poet's garrets. Chorus. We fly by night o'er poet's garrets. [Apollo and Terpsichore ascend in a balloon, and pass over the city just as the clock on the City-Hall ought to strike twelve. The rest of the Muses form a dance on the Battery, and then disperse.

Sprague our pages shall inspire With his grandeur and his fire. Halleck's classic satires charm, Wetmore's martial numbers warm; Pierpoint's airs, and Schroeder's lays, Cheer us on our rugged ways; Here, with Brooks's taste is blent, Bryant's heartfelt sentiment; Sands's humor, Whittier's strength, Bryan's charity, and length; Pickering, Nature's simple bard, Smooth and polished Everard; Willis, delicate and chaste, Percival, of classic taste; Cooper, Irving, Hillhouse, Clark, Nack and all, will âtoe the mark.â Here is Huntley's sweetness stealing, Here is Embury's depth and feeling; Thyrga, Isabel, and Cora, Hinda, Jane, Estelle, and Norna; Ida, Selim, Alpha, Reuben, Damon, Rusticus, and Lubin; Woodbridge, Iolante, Delia, Mary, Emma, and Aurelia; Bogart, gentleâMuzzy, tender, and ????s of every gender; Signs and Greek initials plenty, A, B, C, the four-and-twenty; Then there 's Cassio's manly mind, And not to mention hosts behind. Here they have been, and shall be, The freshest flowers of poesy. Chor. Around, around, around, about, about, Put in the good, and keep the others out. Apol. Nor doth talent less abound, Nor is lesser richness found, In those columns which compose Story or romance of prose; Mirthful sketch, or stricture grave, Tales of wonder on the wave Told in âLeisure Hours at Sea,â When the wind is fair and free. Era. âLittle Genius,â bright and gay, From the racy pen of Fay; Critical remarks by B? On dramatic melody; Inman's candid speculations On domestic publications; W?s âeach month in York,â All combine to aid the work. Apol. All your wonted treasures bring, On this NINTH year's opening; Thoughts that breathe, and words that burn, Bring them to the charmed urn. Enough of lettersânow commence A detail of embellishments; Gems of art, where'er displayed, Put in next our charm to aid. Clio. Here, then, as before, I place Weir's grandeur, Ingham's grace; Newton's truth, and Bennett's nature, Henry Inman's skill in feature; Hoyle's pellucid lake and sky, Fisher's coursers, as they fly; Architectural grace, that shines Bright in Davis's designs, Cummings's delicious bloom, Speaking eye, and snowy plume; Jervis, Leslie, Morse, and Cole, Full of feeling, fire, and soul; Mountain scenery, bold and grand, From the pencil of Durand; Trumbull's patriotic groups, And revolutionary troops; Agate, Reinagle, and Morse, Who teach the canvass to discourse; With a host of names as high, Which oblivion shall defy; Forming each a radiant gem, Modern painting's diadem. Chorus. Taste and genius all combine To embellish volume NINE: Around, around, about, about, Put in the good, the bad keep out. Cal. From the graver's hand, I bring No less rich an offering; Sculptured on these plates, there shine, Form for form, and line for line; Light for light, and shade for shade, In those picture-gems displayed. All may thus their beauties own, Kept before by one alone; Living on each lasting plate, Though the models yield to fate. Here are Smillie's force and brightness, Hoagland's depth, and Hatch's lightness; Sparkling touches from Durand, Scenes from Smith's ingenious hand; Balch and Eddy, Rawdon, Wright, Whose performances delight; Mason, Adams, Anderson, With a host come crowding on, Far too numerous to name, All whose works are known to fame. Apol. Hold! enough of graphic art, City view, and rural chart; Leave them all to tasteful Weir, He will see that they appear. Though we highly prize such treasures, They must yield to Music's measures; For our spells are not complete Till we add an art so sweet. Eut. Let the grateful task be mineâ Haydn's splendor here shall shine; Handel's solemn grandeur roll, Weber's horrors fright the soul; Sweet Rossini's strains that move E'en the sternest hearts to love, With the grave Mozart's combined, Here shall charm the ear and mind; While a thousand more, in turn, Shall contribute to the urn. Apol. Such shall be our spells of power, Meet for chamber, hall, or bower; So our labors we conclude, Now the charm is firm and good. All. Hail to those, whose kind assistance Gave our protegÃ© existence! Hail to those who with renown Did its earliest labors crown! Hail to those who now may grace Its prouder rank, and prosperous race! Hail to all whose generous aid Has a sure foundation laid! On which the Mirror long shall stand, Reflecting light throughout the land. While your smiles our labors cheer, Through another rolling year, We will go about, about, Drawing native talent out, Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine, And thrice again to make up NINE. Peace! the charm's wound up. [Exit Apollo. Enter First Editor. 1st Ed. How now, you promisers of wealth and fame! What is't you do? All. A deed without a name. 1st Ed. I conjure you by that which you foresee, Howe'er you come to know it, answer me To what I ask you. Clio. Speak. Tha. Demand. Terps. We'll answer. 1st Ed. The Mirror's fate? thou dancing necromancers. Clio. Woulds't know it from our mouths, or from our master's? 1st Ed. Conjure them upâlet's see these poet-tasters! Clio. Pour in the milk of roses, and the dew Gathered by starlight, when the moon was new; Nine pearly drops from Heliconia's spring, With gold-dust, shaken from a hum-bird's wing. All. Come high, or low Thyself and office deftly show. [Music. First Apparition, the genius of the Portfolio. 1st Ed. Tell me, thou well-known powerâ Clio. He knows thy thought; Hear his speech, but say thou nought. Appar. Beware of politics! avoid such stuff; Beware of party strife! I 've said enough. [Descends. 1st Ed. Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks, Thou 'st harped my fear arightâwe'll shun their ranks. But one word more. Clio. He will not be commanded: Here comes another, less politeâbut candid. Second Apparition, the genius of the Analectic Magazine. Appar. Attend! attend! attend! 1st Ed. Had I three ears I 'd hear thee to an end. Appar. Be liberal, mild, but manlyâlaugh to scorn The shafts of envy; there 's no journal born Can harm the Mirror with its present talent. [Descends. 1st Ed. Then let them live. Third Apparition, the genius of the Literary Casket and Pocket Magazine. 1st Ed. But who is this young gallant Of baby stature? All. Listen, but speak not; He, like the others, knows thy every thought. Appar. Be independent, firm, and take no care Who chafes, who frets, or where detractors are: The Mirror must be prosperous until Inferior scribblers all its columns fill; Till every tasteless dunce shall weekly see His nonsense in it. [Descends. 1st Ed. That will never be. Sweet bodements! good!âI thank you! yet my heart Throbs to know one thing. Tell me, if your art Can tell so much, of years how many score, How many volumesâ All. Seek to know no more. 1st Ed. I will be satisfied! Deny me this, And you embitter all my promised bliss. All. Show his eyes, and please his heart, Come like shadows, so depart. [Music. A procession of Cupids, each bearing a volume of the Mirror, elegantly bound and lettered, followed by the âLittle Genius,â with his magical glass. As the NINTH volume passes, the editor speaks. 1st Ed. Thou art too like the eighth to be mistook. Thy gilding cheers my eyeballs; and thy look, Thou other gold-bound back, is like the rest; The twelfth is like the former! Be ye blest For showing this! A fourteenth! still in bloom! What! will the line stretch out to the crack of doom! Another yet! Ha! eighteen! nineteen! twenty! All bound and lettered too with gilding plenty! And there 's the Little Genius with a glass, Which shows me many others yet to pass! Delightful prospect! [MusicâMuses vanish. The scene suddenly changes to the editor's closet, where the First Editor appears seated in an arm-chair, rubbing his eyes. Peter, the printer's devil, stands at his elbow. 1st Ed. Well, what is it, Peter? Dev. The printer says there 's neither rhyme nor metre In that there sonnet to a lady's sandal; And bade me tell you that the piece on scandal Is not well pointed. We 're now standing still For want of copy. 1st Ed. That's impossible. Dev. We've not a line, sir, and are short two columns. 1st Ed. Well, here 's enough so fill a dozen volumes, Here, in this urn. Ha! where the dickens is it? Saw you those girls that just made me a visit, And left me in such haste? Dev. I met with none, When I came in, sir, you were all alone, And sound asleep, too, till you heard me call. 1st Ed. Oh! was it but a dream, then, after all! And waiting, too, for copy! From this hour I'll not rely on any fabled power, But on myself alone; that which the NINE Promised in sleep, shall, waking, yet be mine. I'll win the prize; no boasting like a fool, This deed I'll do before my purpose cools. [Writes. Enter Collector. Col. Sir, since you ridiculed that dinner caper, A, B, and C, have bid me stop their paper. 1st Ed. Bring me no more reports! let them fly all; Till dunces fill our columns we can't fall. The hand I write with, and the heart I bear, Shall never sag with doubt, nor shake with fear; I'll write till fingers, head, and sinews ache; Give me some paperânow I'm wide awake. Send out more agents; scour the country round; Stop those that talk of stopping; there'll be found Enough without them. Take this copy, Peter, For volume NINE, Say, is it largerâneater?â False-hearted cravens!âhere's another lot; Throw sonnets to the dogs, we want them not! [Exit Devil. Enter Second Editor. 1st Ed. Of all men else I have so wished for thee; But sit thee down; my fingers as you see, Are stained with ink. A column's wanted still. 2d Ed. I have no wordsâmy voice is in my quill. 1st Ed. Then lay on, Fay, at essay, tale, or puff, Till Peter reappears, and criesâenough! SHOOTING STARS: OR, THE BATTLE OF THE COMETS. AN UNWRITTEN TRAGEDY, IN TWO ACTS. NOT BY SHAKESPEARE. DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Philus Philomusus, a celebrated manufacturer of looking-glasses. Dr. Fungus, editor of the âLiterary Mushroom,â and retailer of catsup. Sedley, editor of the âComet,â with a fiery beard. Fabulator, a writer of the tales, fables, and allegories. Epigram, scribbler on a small scale. Conundrum, scribbler on a small scale. Stanley, a wary politician, on the fence. Caustic, a satirical fellow, supposed to be the dramatist himself. Keeper of the Park, a friend to all parties. Officer, a runner of the marble house. Finance, travelling agent of the looking-glass maker. Trustall, travelling agent for the âMushroom.â Note.âThis travestie was published in the âNew York Mirrorâ on its twelfth anniversary, July, 1834. It was introduced to the readers of the âMirrorâ by an extract from an epistle of the author, as follows; âIn the way of badinage, I yesterday asked my pretty cousin, if she took the âLiterary Mushroom.â She, of course, had never heard of it; and with naivetÃ© peculiar to herself, inquired its character. I told her the term was meant to express, in the abstract, a mass of periodicals, lately set afloat in the world, to pick the pockets of readers, without entertaining or edifying them. She smiled at the conceit, and suggested the name of Doctor Fungus, as the editor. This casual hint gave existence to the following travestie, which will, of course, put your well-known modesty to the blush; but which, I shall, nevertheless, insist upon your publishing, as the prologue for your twelfth volume. I remain, as ever, sub rosa, yours truly, ?.â ACT I. SCENE I The Park, in front of the debtors' jail. Whitey-blue posts seen in endless perspective. The City-Hall clock strikes eleven. Enter Keeper of the Park and Officer. Keeper. Has Fungus, sir, walked forth this morning? Off. No; It was his usual time an hour ago. Keep. At any time, sir, when you see him here, Let no unfeeling creditor come near; I would not have him stared at. See! who 's that, Now entered at the gate, so plump and fat? Off. Sir, 't is the Mirror's principal collector, With pockets lined like some pet-bank director. Keep. Leave me awhile, but be within my call. [Exit Officer. Enter Finance. Good morning, sir, you 're welcome to the hall. I heard last night you had arrived express, With news of your unparalleled success. Fin. Yes, sir; and I am proud to be the man That served the Mirror since it first began. Defeated Fungus will attempt no more To cross our path, as he has done before; No longer will his Mushroom work be knownâ The Mirror, now, securely reigns alone. Keep. Near Tewksbury, I think, in Jersey state, Your agent got two thousand names of late! Has Fungus, sir, lost any friends of note? Fin. Sir, I was posted home by the first boat, Ere an account was taken of his loss; But as I left the place, to come across Upon the railroad, it was boldly said, The Mushroom never more could raise its head! Keep. That work, I fear 's, unlike the Mirror, sir, Too tame and spiritless to make a stir; Worse news than this poor Fungus never met, For on his agent's luck his all was set. Fin. Ill fortune is to Fungus nothing new, sir; He bets at random, and is still the loser; Yet his chagrin he has the tack to hide wellâ How does he pass his time, sir, here in Bridewell? Keep. As one whose income ne'er was half a crown, But as an editor he 's much cast down. Sometimes he reads and walks, and wishes fate Had blest him with a less conspicuous state. Fin. Were it not possible to see this editor? They say he'll talk with any but a creditor. Keep. This is his usual hour of walking out, Here, in the Park; we'll see him soon, no doubt; After his morning draught he seldom fails. Here we may stand unseen, behind these pales, Awhile to observe how he at fortune rails. [They retire. Enter Fungus. Fun. By this time the decisive blow is struckâ Either my agents have been blessed with luck, Or I no more can send the Mushroom forth, For eighteen pence is all that I am worth! Would I had wealth, if fate's stern will were so, For what have we poor editors but wo! While the rich reader pays us, if he chooses, And is content with nothing he peruses! Fin. He seems extremely moved. Keep. He 's ill at ease, I'll introduce you to him, if you please. [Coming forward. Fun. Why, there's another check to proud ambition. That man, through me, obtained his late commission; And now I am his prisonerâhe 's my bail, For the extended limits of the jail. Such an unlooked-for change who could believe, That saw him for his unpaid salary grieve, When I employed him as my out-door clerk? Good morrow, Mr. Keeper of the Park. The grass looks cheerful, and the day is fair. Has any news arrived? Whom have you there? Keep. A gentleman of breeding and address, Who came last night from Tewksbury, express. Fun. Comes he to me with letters or advice? Keep. He serves the Mirror, sir, let that suffice. Fun. Then he wont dun meâso good morning, sir, You 're welcome, though the friend of Philus, for I'm almost such myselfâcould I forget That he grows rich, while I'm confined for debt; Were he not called the great belles-lettres leader, I might be truly happy, and his reader. You 've canvassed in New Jersey!âwhat success? Fin. Ah! that will reach your ears too soon, I guess. Fun. If to my loss it can't too soon. But tell, Are all my agents and collectors well? And does the list of their subscribers swell? Fin. Since my arrival, sir, another post Came in, which brought us word a numerous host, Of your subscribers 'mong the Jersey hills, Have stopped their papers, and not paid their bills! Fun. Fate, do thy worst! the Mushroom then must slumber, I have not paper for another number; No cashâno creditâsighs and prayers are all I have to giveâthe work, alas! must fall! Fin. Our Philus, sir, depends on perseverance, Patience and toil, and faithful friends' adherence, Talent, and taste, and tactâfor these have made him, Yet he pays liberally to all who aid him. His writers love a bold and active leader, And so does every male and female reader. Patrons, like women, must be warmly wooed, Such is the course our Philus has pursued. Fun. Alas! I thought them children, all together, Pleased with a rattle, tickled with a feather. And rather hoped to win their hearts and cash With stale, old stories, anecdotes, and trash! But literary editors, I find, Are put in trust for tastes of every kind; And when themselves are void of wit and tact, Who can say how their patrons may not act? Enter Officer. Off. Sir, here's a man, who told me, with a groan, He wished to see the doctor, all alone. Keep. I come to him. [Exit Keeper. Fin. His business must require Your private ear, and so I will retire; Wishing you all the earthly good I can, Not wronging him I serveâthe Mirror man. [Exit Finance. Fun. Farewell; alas! who can this fellow be? A sudden chill is running over me. I fear some heavy news. Enter Keeper. Who is't, O'Hare? Keep. A man whose looks bespeak a world of care. A melancholy messenger, I dread, For when I asked the news, he shook his head. He comes express from Tewksbury to you, I fear his news is fatal, so adieu! [Exit. Fun. Fatal, indeed! his brow 's a running title, That speaks the page below, a sad recital. Enter Trustall. Say, friend, how goes the work?âdo many stop? Of new subscribers have you reaped a crop? Thou tremblest, and the whiteness of thy cheek Is apter than thy tongue, the news to speak. E'en such a man, so faint and wo-begone, So dead in look, so dull, and so forlorn, Drew Simpson's curtain, when the night was lowery, And told him Forrest had redeemed the Bowery. Now wouldst thou sayââyour pen did thus and thus, And thus your scissors, both enraptured us:â Stopping my greedy ear with flattery's meed, Till in the end, to stop my ear indeed, Thou hast a sigh to change this dew to frost, Ending with scissorsâpenâandâallâare lost. Trust. Your scissors yet remain, from hook impending, But for your penâ Fun. Why that, perhaps, wants mending; Although I scarcely use it once a week. Yet, say, good Trustallâspeak, I charge thee, speak! Must we yield up our editorial fame, And let the Mirror every honor claim? Must each competitor still lose the prize! Tell thou thy master his suspicion lies, And I will take it as a kind disgrace, And thank thee for such insult to my face. Trust. Your fears are true; the Mirror âgoes ahead.â Fun. Yet, for all this, say not the Mushroom's dead. Trust. I'm sorry I must force you to believe, A sad disaster nothing can retrieve; But all your Jersey patrons, sir, are lost; They 've stopped the Mushroom, and not paid the cost; While each of them now takes, oh! cursed chance, The New York Mirror, paid for in advance! They say, âthat sheet, beside our Mushroom paper, Is like the sun compared to farthing taper! Its active spirit lends a fire, that's fanned E'en to the dullest peasant in the land; And makes its way against all opposition, Though ever courting generous competition.â A nobler work, or one in richer dress, Was never issued from the weekly press. In fine, its editor has won the field, And your sharp scissors and dull pen must yield. Fun. Yet, hold! for oh, this prologue lets me in To a vile plotâwhere have our agents been? Why suffered they such chances to befall? They should have given every one a call. Trust. The lucky Philus, seeking our defeat, Called for the Mushroom, and was shown a sheet; Asking what reparation we could make, For all the articles our scissors take Without acknowledgment. When I with pride, Impatient of such taunts, indignant cried, âHold! most ambitious editor of York, At champagne parties first to draw a cork, While speaking with my master's mouth, you see, I now propose the selfsame words to thee, Which thou wouldst have me answer to.â From these More words arose, and we had quite a breeze, Till, in the end, two thousand names were struck From our subscription list! Confound the luck! Low in the dust our scissors' journal lies, From whence, with life 't will never more arise. Fun. Oh! hadst thou stabbed, at every word thou'st uttered, Sharp scissors in my flesh, I 'd not have muttered A single oath! Oh, heavens! methinks I see My little pet in mortal agony! Gorging the ravenous wolf's insatiate crop! But, say, did allâdid all our patrons stop? Trust. All but the free listâfifteen hundred, ten. Fun. Let them, too, stop. Inhospitable men! Against our rigid rules, a balance due, To discontinue without paying too! Was't not enough to have the secret blown, That we ne'er wrote a sentence of our own; That all our pictures were from worn-out plates; Our newest fashions all of last year's dates; But must you cheat us out of all we sent you? Nor could the editor's lost fame content you? You never published, monsters, if you had, You 'd know the pang of being driven mad! Trust. Take comfort, sir, and hope a better day; Another work, perhaps, will better pay. Fun. Oh! who can tamely, and with patience fast, By thinking on an alderman's repast, Or wander coatless, when 't is damp and chill, By bare remembrance of a tailor's bill? Away! by heavens, I shall abhor to see The man who talks of publishing to me. And when thou sitt'st up late, with good old folks, In tedious winter nights, to crack your jokes, Amuse them with the marvellous relation Of many a poor, ill-fated publication, Which, like my own, have toiled, with heart and hand, To mar the brightest Mirror in the land, And toiled in vain, but died at last unreadâ And send your hearer laughing to his bed. [Exeunt omnes. SCENE II. A street in New York, near St. Paul's Church. Enter Philus, with arms folded, Ã  la Kean. Phi. Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by this bright event; And all the clouds, which on the Mirror frowned, In the deep bosom of the ocean drowned. Now are our brows with laurel chaplets twined; Our doubts and fears are given to the wind; Eleven volumes, bound at great expense, Are now displayed as gilded monuments Of our success, filled with the choicest treasures, Engraving, music, and delightful measures; Grim Opposition smooths his wrinkled face, And now, instead of jockeying in the race, To check our course, convinced of his mistake, Has struck his flag, and follows in our wake. But I, that am not shaped for fawning tricks, To bite, and snarl, and lick the foot that kicks, Why I shall still, without remorse or dread, In duty's path, like Crockett, go ahead. Mid flowers of literature I'll toil and delve, And my next step commences Volume Twelve. [Exit. SCENE III. The Park. Fungus reading a pamphlet. Enter Philus and the Keeper. Phi. Good-day, my lord; what subject is't you read? I fear, I bother you. Fun. You do indeed. Phi. Friend, leave us to ourselves; we must confer. [Exit Keeper. Fun. I owe you nothing; what 's your business, sir? Phi. Suspicion haunts the guilty, like a ghost, He sees a bailiff in each painted post. Fun. Where guilt without controlment, holds his sway, And steals a rival's patronage away, An editor might fear each post a Turk; And I, proprietor of one sweet work, Have now the fatal object in my eye, Who caused my periodical to die. Phi. Why, what a dunce was Ãsop's bird of night, To ape the eagle in his mid-day flight, Till Sol's bright rays did all his powers confound, And so, for all his wings, the fool was drowned. Thou shouldst have been content as carrier, sir, And not aspired to be an editor. With a poor, frothy brain, half-crazed with rhyming, Nor broken thus thy neck with foolish climbing. Fun. Hadst broken thine, when first thou chased a bubble, It might have saved Jack Ketch a little trouble; But thou wast born to edify mankind, Amuse the ladies, and improve their mind; To reach the top of fame and fortune's ladder, While I, beneath its foot, have played the adder. How many love-sick lines and maiden sighs Hast thou to answer for! how many eyes Of liquid blue hast thou gemmed round with pearls Bright as thy wit; how many lovely girls Will bless the hour that gave thy Mirror birth! The tuneful cricket chirruped in the hearth; The mocking-bird sung, a plagiaristic sign, Foreboding many a sweet, but stolen line; Ãolian harps were heard upon the breeze, And, though 't was August, blossoms decked the trees; The kittens gambolled in their frolic play, And thrilling expectation held its sway; Canaries warbled with their sweetest glee, And currant tarts were all the rage for tea; More than a printer's pains thy printer took, (Thy types were not by Connor nor by Cooke,) Yet brought forth less of hopeâI mean in size, Mottoes it had, and Algebra sublime, With much of Woodworth's amatory rhyme; Types in its head, like German text appeared, And if the rest be true, that I have heard, It came into the worldâ Phi. I'll hear no more. Take this bank-note, and pay thy paper score; I'll puff thy work; my censures were but feigned; For this, among the rest, was I ordained. Fun. Oh! and for much more generous acts than this, Just Heaven reward thee with a life of bliss! Phi. What! shall the aspiring hopes of talent sink, Which should have mounted? see what tears of ink, My pen shall shed in sympathy for him, Who sought the Mirror's downfall; he shall swim; And, if a doubt remain, thy hopes to wither, Down, down to Wall street, say I sent thee thither; Cash itâ't is genuine. [Exit Fungus. Indeed, 't is true, What Fungus told me of; our work, when new, Came forth into the world with some acclaim, For all admired the Mirror and its frame; The men all wondered, and the female tribe Cried, âHeaven bless us, let us all subscribe!â And so they did, which plainly showed they prized it, And, till this hour they've always patronized it. Stay, let me seeâthe eleventh volume 's done, No sharing spoils before the field is won. I'll quickly sell each copy that remains; When they are gone, then must I count my gains. [Exit. ACT II. SCENE I. The Battery. The steam packet William Gibbons, just arriving from Charleston. Enter Philus. Phi. Now, by St. Paul, the work goes bravely on, And doubt no longer argues pro and con. What molehill mountains would not prudence see, Through some weak eyes, to undertake like me! Come, comeâthis doubt's a scarecrow after all, Cold prudence climbs not, lest it chance to fall, While confidence soon scales the laden bough, And banquets on the fruit, as I do now. E'en all mankind to wealth and fame incline, Great men choose greater meansâthe Mirror's mine. Enter Finance, with papers. Fin. Good news, my lord, the William Gibbons spoke, Below the Hook, the packet Hearts of Oak, And brought up all our European filesâ Read their contents, and see how fortune smiles. Here's one that saysââthe thrilling notes of fame, From north to south, from east to west, proclaim, The New York Mirror's worth, to every ear, In every clime, and zone, and hemisphere; In England, Scotland, Germany, and France, And throughout Asia, does it cause advance; While classic bards in Italy and Greece, Awake their lyres to honor its increase. Phi. Thy news, Finance, true modesty can 't swallow; Go, wash it down, and here 's a phÅnix dollar. [Exit Finance. Was ever Fame thus boldly wooed and won? Has ever Fame adopted such a son? What I! without a friend my suit to back, To court her thus, and yet not get the sack! Upon my life, the goddess seems to find Something in me. I'll have my office lined With Mirror picturesâand I'll keep in pay A score or two of artists, by the day. For since I 've crept in favor with myself, I will maintain itânever mind the pelf. Enter Epigram. Phi. Cousin of Epigram, give me thy hand, I'm glad to see theeâhow do matters stand In the proud Athens of our native land. Epi. Apollo and the muses, in convention, Agreed, at once, without the least dissension, To braid a civic chaplet for thy brow, Of flowers and laurelsâthey are at it now. Phi. Now, by St. Paul! methinks I feel it here, Its tints and odors do my senses cheer! What think'st thou, cousinâwert an easy matter, To get a âBrush Hat,â too, from Bond the hatter? Epi. No doubt, my lord, he strait shall send you one. Phi. Thus far, before the wind, we gayly run. My fortune smiles, and no one boon refuses, Even to a chaplet from the tuneful muses! Tell Bond to send the best upon his shelf. Epi. I fly to serve thee. Phi. Say to serve thyself. For by-and-by, claim thou of me, my cousin, (Our work complete), and thou shalt have a dozen. [Exit Epigram. Why, now my golden dream is out at last, Ambition, like an early friend, hast cast With eager hand, my curtains back, to say, That what I dreamed last night is true to-day. A laurel crown! thou bright reward of toil, Oh! how thy glory makes my spirits boil; Lie still, my heart, more nerves must yet be strained, Crowns won by toil, must be by toil maintained. [Exit Philus. SCENE II. The Mirror publication office, filled with poets and authors. Phi. Stand all apartâcousin of Epigram, At length, by thy assistance, here I am Applauded by the daily pressâbut say, Shall we but wear these laurels for a day, Or shall they last as fresh as they are now? Epi. I hope for ages, sir, they'll grace thy brow. Phi. Oh! Epigram! reluctant I proceed, To try if thou be steadfast friend indeed. Now, though thy friendly hand once took my part, When envious Slander threw a venomed dart, I would have some kind friend to aid me still. Epi. Why you have here a thousand, sir, that will. Phi. Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dullâ Shall I be plain? I wish thy teeming skull To furnish a poetical address, About this chaplet, and the Mirror press. Epi. I must attempt whate'er your highness pleases. Phi. Indeed! methinks thy former kindness freezes. Thou dost refuse me, then? Epi. Allow me time To think, and I may hammer out a rhyme. [Exit Epigram. Phi. I'll henceforth deal with bards of nobler flight; None write for me, who can't compose at sight. High-reaching Epigram grows circumspect, And studies hard, but seldom writes correct. Still there are traits of excellence about him; The best on 't is, it can be done without himâ Better, perhaps, for did he not decline, Why, then the verses had been his, not mine. We'll make a shift as 't is. Come here, Finance; Didst thou to Caustic certain sums advance? Fin. I did, sir. Phi. Give him, then, this note, and say, Ourselves would speak a word with him to-day. [Exit Finance. This plodding Epigram no more shall be The neighbor of my councils. What! has he So long held out untired, nor paused to blow, And stops he now for breath? well, be it so. Enter Stanley. Well, Stanley, have you any news to tell us? Stan. I hear, my liege, that Sedley has grown jealous, And will get up a paper of his own, And vows the Mirror shall be overthrown. He calls his sheet the Comet, and has paid A year's advance for your Conundrum's aid. Phi. Why let him go, we've many such to spare. Hark thee, friend Selim, where is Mrs. Thayer? Selim. In the far West, I hear she 's teaching school. Phi. I'll write to her, before my purpose cool. Enter Epigram. Epi. My lord, I have considered in my mind Your late request, and do not feel inclined To undertake that curious rhyming medley. Phi. Well, let that rest. Conundrum writes for Sedley. Epi. I 've heard the news, sir. Phi. He 's your kinsman, Stanley. But you'll condemn an action so unmanly. Epi. My lord, I claim that gift, by promise due, A dozen hatsâbut I'll compound for twoâ Phi. Stanley, beware! for if your wife see fit To write for Sedley, you shall answer it. Epi. What says your highness to my just request? Phi. I do remember me, when once my guest, This Sedley wrote an interesting column, For number one, I think, of our ninth volume, And our friend Fay did prophesy that he Some future day, an editor would be. Enter Finance. 'T is oddâan editorâperhaps. Where's Caustic? Fin. At your book-table, writing an acrostic. Epi. May 't please you to resolve me in my suit? Phi. Conduct him to my closetâbut be mute. [Exit Finance. Epi. I beg your highness' ear, my lord, again. Phi. I'm busyâthou troublest meâI'm not i' th' vein. [Exit Philus. Epi. By the lord Harry! is it thus he pays My services, and all my lines of praise? If his contributors have any sense Of such ungentle treatment, they'll dispense Their favors to the âCometââgrave Viator, Claudius, Potentus, Caustic, Fabulator, Congerro, Croaker, Gamut, and the rest, Till a new galaxy shall light the West. [Exit. SCENE III. Front vestibule of the City-Hall. Philus reading a communication. Phi. How sweet is every strain from Lydia Huntley! Enter Finance. Good news or bad, that thou com'st in so bluntly? Fin. Bad news, my lord, as I can gather from it, That Peregrine is writing for the Comet; And Epigram has left us in a huff, To write for Sedley a prodigious puff. Phi. Perry with Sedley touches me more near Than Epigram's revolt; but hence with fear! Dangers retreat when boldly they 're confronted, Neither my courage nor my pen is blunted. Let 's muster men who racy quills can wield, We must be brief when traitors brave the field. Collect our forces: Paulding, Irving, Stone, Bryant and Wetmore, Woodworth, Knapp, and Hone, Pintard and Stuart, Strong, Verplanck, and Wharton, Sage Matthew Carey, Payne, and General Morton; Dunlap and Leggett, Hoffman, Cox, and Fay, Willis and Inman, Palmer, Sprague, and Day; Smillie, Durand, with Weir, and Simms, and Hawes, With Clarke and Bird, and all who love our cause; Bid all our fair invincibles assemble: Tuneful Pierce Butler, late Miss Fanny Kemble, Fair Sigourney and Embury, advance; Come, see, and conquer with a single glance! Aiken and Bogart, Vanderpool and Brooks, Whipple and Gould, Montgomery and Crookes Muzzy, and Fitch, and Thayer, disdain to shrink, And quench this Comet in a sea of ink. Enter Caustic. How now? the news? Caus. A work will soon be out, Yclept the Comet, edited, no doubt, By recreant Sedley, who now waits assistance From Epigram, to give the brat existence. [Exit. Phi. Why, let it come, then. Hasten you, Finance, Swiftly as you can make White Surrey prance, Post to Whitehall, to Fabulator's bower, Bid him straight levy all the strength and power That he can make; 't is Paulding that I mean, Beg him to furnish all that he can glean, And meet me here at eight to-morrow morn. Commend me to his grace. Away! begone! [Exit Finance. Enter Stanley. Well, my good lord, what news have you collected? Stan. Willis is on the seas, and soon expected. Phi. Well, what of Sedley, and the Comet press. Stan. I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess. Phi. Well, as you guess? Stan. Sustained by Epigram, Conundrum, Ondit, Rebus, Flash, and Flam, Sedley expects to win a laurel crown. Phi. Where are thy forces, then, to put him down? Where be thy legends, tales, romantic stories, Grave essays, proverbs, fables, allegories, The foe at hand, and thou no arms to meet 'em! No classic fire to scatter and defeat 'em! Or, hast thou sold such literary lumber, To help the rebels out in their first number? Stan. My lord, such subjects, serious and erratic, Are all transcribed, and ready in my attic. Phi. What do they in the attic, sapient sir, When here they 're needed by thy editor? Away, then, to thy garret for themâstay, I will not trust thee. I have thought a way To make thee sureâif thou play'st double game, I'll blazon to the world thy real name; So I'll expect thy papers without fail, Or else thy fame's assurance is but frail. Stan. As I prove true, my lord, so deal with that. Enter Caustic. Caus. Poor Epigram is sued, sir, for a hat, And what subscribers he procured, refuse To pay the balance of their several dues; Saying, that their subscription was a shame. Phi. Off with their names!âso much for Epigram. Caus. My lord, I'm sorry I 've more news to tell. Phi. Out with it, Caustic, we can bear it well. Caus. Sedley has come out with a daily sheet, Which boys are peddling now in every street. One cent a-piece is all the price they ask; An eighth of which rewards them for their task; It carries all before it, it is said, As eighty thousand copies have been spread. The Sun, the Moon, the Star, and fifty others, All join the Comet, like a band of brothers, Phi. Why, ay, this looks rebellion! Stop the press! And put in our poetical address. By heaven, this news my stirring soul alarms, And all my energies are now in arms! Come forth, my honest pen! which, here I vow, Shall not again be dry as it is now; Ne'er shall these watching eyes have needful rest, Till these apostates have been skinned and dressed, Ne'er shall these limbs on downy bed regale Till I have seized this Comet by the tail! [Exit in a rage SCENE IV. Office of the Cometâpublication morning. Sedley, Epigram, Conundrum, Acrostic, &amp;c. Sed. Thus far, on sweet revenge and profit bent, Have we marched on without impediment, And poured our streams of poison round (sans pity), Into the very bowels of the city. And here 's a letter, which friend Stanley sent, With lines of comfort and encouragement, Such as will help to animate our cause, And gild our triumph with the town's applause. Our comet still shall sweep along its path, To some a fearful visitant of wrath, To others, lightâthen let it still on high Brandish its fiery tresses in the sky, And with them scourge the bad, revolting âstars,â That have consented to the loud huzzas, Which greet The New York Mirror every week, Whose worth we envy, and whose fall we seek. When beggars die, there are no Comets seen; The âMushroomâ fell, and all went on serene; But ere the mightiest Julius fell, in Rome, Stars dropped down blood, portentous of his doom! So, ere the aspiring Mirror tumble down, Our sweeping âCometâ startles all the town. Con. Your words have fire, my lord, and make those glow, Who trembled at the number of our foe. Sed. Why, were they doubled we should conquer still; Thrice is he armed who holds a ready quill; While he who scribbles with a patent pen Can ne'er supply, with copy, half his men. Then, go ahead, my lads; to hope still cling, And pluck your quills from the proud eagle's wing. [Exeunt with a flourish. SCENE V. Publication office of the Mirror, as before. Philomusus, Fabulator, Caustic, Claudius, &amp;c. Phi. Good Fabulator, sir, the cheerful speed Of your supply deserves my thanks indeed. Fab. I am rewarded, sir, in having power To serve my friend. Phi. May Fame and Fortune shower Their favors on you. Is it ascertained, How many patrons have, in all, been gained For this same âComet?â Fab. Sir, they can but boast Of six or seven thousand, at the most. Phi. Why, our battalia treble that account; Besides, the Mirror's name is like a mount Of eastern granite, which the rebels lack. Caus. The most of them lack jackets to their back, Oh, Muse of Grub street! such a tattered host; So poor; so famished; each a fleshless ghost; 'T is well for them that we've no buzzards here. Phi. Now, by St. Paul, we'll send them bread and beer. Dinners and coatsâapparel, food, and drink, Plenty of paper, and good writing ink; And beat them then. How long, do ye think, my lords, Before these fools repent this war of words? Caus. To-morrow scatters these ill-favored cattle, So soon, I hear they mean to give us battle. Phi. The sooner, still, the better; we are ready. No dangers daunt the heart that's always steady. Enter Finance. Will Stanley aid us with his writings, sir. Fin. He does refuse, my lord; he will not stir. Phi. Dearly shall he repent, he did refuse 'em! A thousand hearts are swelling in my bosom, Fame's trumpet calls me to the taskâaway! My soul's in arms, and eager for the fray! [Exeunt with a flourish. SCENE VI. Interior of a modern printing establishment. On one side the compositors are seen at their cases, on the other are steam-presses, in full operation. Stage dark. Enter Philomusus from a closet. Phi. 'T is now the dead of night, and half the town Are sleeping on their beds ofâstraw or down, Yet I, with all my care-worn thoughts, mayhap, Shall not be able to procure a nap. The clock strikes twelve! and hark! from room to room The sounds of printing-engines pierce the gloom: Press answers press with clank of iron wheels, While from each case a fainter murmur steals, The clink of types in the composing-sticks, Of which compositors scarce see the nicks, All giving note of preparation for To-morrow morning's literary war. My stern impatience chides this night's delay, Which limps so slow and tediously away. I'll to my closet, and attempt once more, To catch a snooze, for I must stir at four. Ha! what sweet sounds are those which greet my ears! [Music is heard. Sure 't was the music of the tuneful spheres, Or the soft warblings of a seraph's lyre! No matter what it wasâI must retire. [Lies downâsleepsâdreams. Music. Vision of Apollo and the Muses, who approach his couch, and Apollo holds a laurel crown over the sleeper's head, while goddesses appear to kiss him! Apollo. O thou, whose courage, sleeping or awake, Not all the terrors of thy foes can shake, Where conscience and where friends thy course approve, Sleep on, while I, commissioned from high Jove, With dreams of rapture sweeten thy repose, And give thee confidence to meet thy foes. CHORUS OF THE MUSES. Place the chaplet on his head, Scatter roses o'er his bed; Philomusus, friend of ours, We will strew thy couch with flowers; Philus, persevere in duty, Friend of virtueâfriend of beauty; Thus we virgin sisters nine, Thus thy brows with garlands twine; Dew ambrosial thou shalt sip, Take it from each Muse's lip. [They each stoop and kiss him. Philus, persevere in dutyâ Friend of virtueâfriend of beauty. Apollo. The morning's dawn has summoned us away, Now Philomusus, wake, without delay! Ere blaze of noon has drowned the morning's beam, Thou shalt have realized this pleasing dream; Philus, awake! thy hopes and means are ampleâ Awake! to gifted minds a bright example. Lively music. Philomusus starts from his couch, and rushes to the front, Ã  la Kean. Phi. Give me another wreath!âanother kiss!â Thanks, bright Apollo! for this hour of bliss! Ha! was it, after all, then, but a dream! But then so fascinating did it seem, That all my pulses now with rapture playâ Who 's there? Enter Finance. Fin. 'T is I, my lord; 't will soon be day, Your friends are up, and ready for the fray. Phi. Oh! I have had so sweet a dream tonight. Fin. A right good omen, sir, of Sedley's flight. Phi. I feel it is so; at them, then, pell-mell! Such be the fate of all who dare rebel. [Exeunt with a flourish. SCENE VII. The field of battleâflourishes, shouts, and every kind of noise the prompter can conveniently make. Enter Philus Philomusus. Phi. What, ho! young Sedley! Philomusus calls! I hate thy paper for 't is worked with balls. Now, if thou dost not hide thee from my quill, Sedley, I say, come forth and try thy skill! I'll meet thee here, with all thy Grub street force, I'll hold my tongueâfor I am getting hoarse. [Exitâflourish. Enter Caustic and Finance. Fin. Rescue! oh, rescue! noble Caustic, quick! Great Philus Philomusus beats old Nick! His quill 's used up, and he with pencil writes, Dashing at Sedley, and his scribbling wights. Enter Philomusus. Phi. A pen!âa pen!âmy kingdom for a pen! Caus. I'll fly to Jansen's, sir, and get you ten. Phi. Slave! must I wait at such a time for thee? When every second is a century! I think there be six âCometsâ in the fray, Five have I pulled down by the beard to-day, Instead of Sedley'sâbut I'll try againâ A penâa penâmy kingdom for a pen! Rally your powers, Finance! your forces rally; I'll lead you on to a most glorious sally: Draw, archers draw, your arrows to the head, With shafts of satire strike the rebels dead! Spur Pegasus, ye poets, till he prance, Ye cannoniers of argument, advance; Charge, ye light cavalry of anecdote, While Fame's shrill trumpet breathes its liveliest note; Rattle quick vollies forth, ye rhyming lovers, Advance your standards (blue and yellow covers;) Upon them, Caustic, with your forces charge! Gamut, push on! with buckler, shield, and targe; Level long-toms, good Leggett, at his hull, And let a shower of grape salute his skull; With whole broadsides of tales assail the dolts, 'Twixt wind and water, sirâdrive home their bolts! On, gallant Power, with hot hell-kettle fights; Lawson, advance, with all thy Scottish knights; Charge, Paulding, charge! with tales and allegories; On, Dunlap, on! with thy dramatic stories; Outflank them, Woodworth, with thy wingÃ©d prancers, Supported by thy Amazonian lancers; Sound drums and trumpets! boldly and cheerfully! The word, St. George, Mirror, and victory! [A most glorious flourish, in the midst of which a bright and fiery comet, accompanied by a shower of stars, is seen to fall into the North river, where it expires in a hiss, in which it is expected all the audience will participate. Shouts of victory succeed, and the curtain falls amid thunders of applause. ADDRESS FOR THE OPENING OF THE NEW PARK THEATREâSPOKEN BY MRS. BARNES, IN THE CHARACTER OF MELPOMENE. What glorious vision bursts upon my view! Does fancy mock me? No, 't is true! 't is true! No false illusive dream of past delight, But blest realities, salute my sight: The ruthless fiend of ruin is displaced, By beauty, fashion, elegance, and taste. Thrilled with such rapture as when first I pressed The infant Shakespeare to this throbbing breast, I hail the scene, my temple and my home, While rays of beauty light the vaulted dome. Despair, avaunt! the storm of grief is past, And joy's bright sunshine gilds the scene at last! Here, where the tragic muse has mourned so long The sleep of passion, and the death of song, Where o'er the urn of blighted hopes she hung, With vacant, beamless eye, and silent tongue; While shapeless heaps of ruins smoked around, And desolation marked the blackened groundâ Here, from its ashes, see her temple burst, With grace and splendor that surpass the first. So from its parent's dust the phÅnix springs, With Eden's richest plumage in his wings; Thus dazzling soars, unrivalled, and alone, His age a century, and a world his own. Ye generous freemen, who in danger stand The shield and bulwark of our happy land; Who, mid the sweeter luxuries of peace, Behold your greatness with your arts increase; Whose liberal minds throw lustre on the age, Oh still protect and patronize the stage; That bright auxiliar in refinement's cause, Which raised proud Greece to what at length she was, Invited forth, and scattered, unconfined, The boundless treasures of a Shakespeare's mind; And taught the vulgar barbarous sons of strife, The gentler courtesies that sweeten life. Ye freeborn fair, who grace Columbia's clime, Whose bosoms glow with sentiments sublime; Whose smiles inspire the actions they reward, Whose tears embalm the virtues they applaud; Still let those smiles and tears alternate prove That wit can charm, that sympathy can move. And while your hearts celestial truth revere, Still condescend to trace her picture here; Still let your presence consecrate the art That holds a mirror to the human heart; That shows the black and hideous form of vice, And raises virtue's worth beyond a price; That culls the fruits of fancy's wide domains, That calls from poesy her sweetest strains; That teaches young affection what alone Can make a virtuous, manly heart, her own; And shows to art how vain are all its wiles, That he who wins must first deserve your smiles. Columbians, all! ye patriots, and ye fair, Still let the drama claim your generous care; Cherished by you, it will the champion prove Of freedom, virtue, and the arts you love; So shall this city, by refinement blest, Become the pride and mistress of the West; So shall your country rise to greater fame, And endless glory gild Columbia's name. ADDRESS WRITTEN FOR THE OPENING OF THE WARREN THEATRE. A bard, whose name will live an endless age, Has truly said that all the world's a stage; And we may add, that each revolving day Presents some scene of an eventful play. But whether tragic scenes our grief excite, Or comic incidents afford delight; Whether the pompous pageantry of war Spreads ruthless devastation wide and far, Or peaceful arts, with rural joys attract The pleased attention through the busy act; Whate'er the piece, or style of execution, It always terminates in revolution. This forms the grand catastrophe of all The various dramas acted since the fall; For be the curious plot whate'er it may, The time a century, or a single day; A CÃ¦sar slaughtered, or a Samson shorn, A rustic wedded, or a nation born; A broken bank, or mended constitution, Or a new stageâ't is still a revolution. Mark how the curious insect-artists drive Their surplus population from the hive; Who, in their turn, a new republic form Whence their own offspring are compelled to swarm; So woodland songsters quit their parent's care, And with their new-fledged pinions cleave the air; Seek a new home beneath another sky, And teach their own young nestlings how to fly. Such is Eternal Wisdom's wondrous plan, Through all his works, from insects up to man; The modest virgin owns her bashful flame, And yields her parent's for a lover's name; While he whose virtues win her fond embrace, Becomes the founder of another race. Fired with the glow of hardy enterprise, To western scenes the young adventurer flies, Where the first tree his sounding axe brings down, Forms the foundation of a future town. Charmed by such zeal, sustained by kindred force, The forests melt, and rivers change their course; Till howling deserts blossom like the rose, And each rude hamlet to a city grows; Till a new state is added to the nation, Another star to Freedom's constellation. 'T was the same principle, that brought of yore, Our pilgrim fathers to Columbia's shore, Where their descendants Freedom's flag unfurled, And gave a new republic to the world. If, then, the drama tend to mend the heart, Refine the taste, and moral truths impart, You'll all confess that this enlightened age, And growing city, claim another stage; And on the strongest proof that we are right, Behold this bright assemblage here to-night. See beauty, fashion, genius, science, wit, With taste and elegance, in box and pit; All eager to support attempts like this, To lighten care, and heighten human bliss; Philanthropists, who by experience know How sweet the pleasures which from virtue flow; Who feel that blessing others is the best, The only way of being truly blest. PRIZE ADDRESS, ON THE OPENING OF A CIRCUS. The cultured mind, accustomed to explore And taste the choicest sweets of classic lore, With rapture dwells on each inspiring lay That paints the sports of Grecia's proudest day; When the thronged stadium rang with loud acclaims, To hail the victor in her manly games; Those daring feats which famed Alcides taught, To nerve the limb, and elevate the thought; Feats which the royal Iphitus restored, And consecrated to the powers adored; Which gave to Greece a wreath of fadeless bloom, And raised the glory of imperial Rome. There, the fleet courser, with an eye of flame. Bold, like his riderâand as proud of fame, Impatient champed the bit, or pawed the ground, With ear erect, to catch the trumpet's sound; Then, with a speed that mocked the passing wind, Spurned the dull earth, and left the world behind. And with him flewâerect upon his feet! The bold equestrian, through the furious heat, Reckless of dangerâ(such are Grecians still)â The rein submitted to the courser's will, While, at the target, with unerring art, The fearless rider threw the whizzing dart! Or, with a harnessed pair, of equal speed, Vaulted with matchless grace, from steed to steed, While mingled sounds of wonder and applause Proclaimed the deepest interest in his cause; Till, past the goal, and claimant of the prize, When peals of acclamation pierced the skies. With feats like these, to charm the present age, And join the stadium to the modern stage; To elevate the pleasures of the ring, By every aid dramatic art can bringâ For this, you see, another fabric reared, Where late a dreary, barren waste appeared! For this, kind patrons, we would humbly sue, To dedicate the tasteful fane to you. Here shall Latona's bright-haired son impart The sweetest lessons of his tuneful art; Here may the eye of taste admire the speed, And graceful prowess, of the generous steed; And here, in pleased astonishment, may scan The still more wondrous active powers of man. Here, studious votaries of the classic page May view the feats of Grecia's golden age; Feats which secured the victors of the game Unfading honors, and a deathless fame; Inspired her youth with that chivalric glow Which urged them onward to subdue the foe; Which fired her sons with emulative zeal, To rise the guardians of their country's weal; To which she owed the glory of her state, And that unconquered pride which made her great; Preserved her freedomâgained the world's applause, And prompts her now to be what then she was. And if like causes like effects produce, If you admit the stadium's wondrous use, May not a thousand equal blessings spring From such achievements as shall grace our ring? May not our patriot youth, who here perceive What sprightliness and courage can achieve, Be fired with emulation to command âThe fiery steed, and train him to their hand!â To vault, like feathered Hermes, on his back, And fearless guide him to the fierce attack; To wield the sabre, or direct the dart, And boldly practise each equestrian art; To wrestle, leap, or throw the pondrous quoit, And bear away the palm in each exploit? Yes, generous patronsâthus our gallant youth, Champions of freedom, honor, love, and truth, Will learn to guard the sacred rights you prize, And raise Columbia's glory to the skies; In every clime behold her flag unfurled, Till Freedom's golden star shall light the world. ADDRESS, SPOKEN BY MR. HAMBLIN ON THE OCCASION OF A COMPLIMENTARY BENEFIT TO MR. COOPER THE TRAGEDIAN. âThe king comes here to-night!â He who could wring Our hearts at will, was âevery inch a king!â For when in life's bright noon, the stage he trod, In majesty and grace, a demi-god; With form, and mien, and attitude, and air Which modern kings might envy in despair; When his stern brow, and awe-inspiring eye, Bore sign of an imperial majesty; Thenâin the zenith of his gloryâthen, He moved a model for the first of men! The drama was his empire: and his throne No rival dared disputeâhe reigned alone! âHis feet bestrode the ocean! his waved arm Crested the world!â His voice possessed a charm, To love's, to friendship's, and to classic ears, Like the sweet music of the tuneful spheres: âBut, when he meant to quail, and shake the world,â His accents were âlike rattling thundersâ hurled, Or plead, âlike angels, trumpet-tongued,â to prove The worth of freedom, and the joys of love! Whether he gave ungentle wives rebuke, As simple Leon, or Aranza's duke, Or tamed (as wild Petruchio) the shrew, Or showed a fiend in the unpitying Jew; Displayed the wrecks of passion's withering storm, In stern Penruddock's, or the Stranger's form; Whether he bid unnumbered victims bleed, âAs Macedonia's madman, or the Swede,â Moved as Iago, or the generous Moor, Or gallant Rolla, mid the battle's roar, Stemming alone, the tide of war and death; Hamlet, or Damon; Bertram or Macbeth; Gloster, Young Wilding, Falstaff, Charles de Moor, The graceful Doricourt, the gay Belcour; Brutusâaye, both the Brutusesâof Rome; Mark Antony, lamenting CÃ¦sar's doom; The proud Coriolanus, or the sire Of sweet Virginia. Still his soul of fire With grandeur blazed, to ravish or appalâ He âwas the noblest Roman of them all!â Whether he wore the reckless mien of Pierre, Or the time-scathed decrepitude of Lear, âFourscore and upwardsââhe might justly say, âDidn't I, fellow! I have seen the day,â When, with the very lightning of my brow, âI would have made them skipâI am old now, And these same crosses spoil me:ââ Yes, 'tis true He once commanded, where he now must sue; For he's old nowâand those unrivalled powers For you exerted, in his happiest hours, Like flickering lights, which in their sockets burn, Are fast departingânever to return! But shall he now, when silvered o'er with age, Who never made his exit on the stage But 'mid the thunders of heartfelt applause, Unhonored pass when he at last withdraws? He, who devoted all his noon-day powers To strew your thorny path with classic flowersâ He, whom with laurels you have richly decked, Shall he at last be chilled with cold neglect? Perish the thought!â'Tis Cooper's right to claimâ Besides the glory of a deathless nameâ Of your regard, a more substantial proof Than the loud cheers which shake this vaulted roofâ Protection for his offspring!âdearer far To his fond heart than earthly glories are; And you concede this claimâor else to-night, Here were not seen a galaxy so bright, Of beauty, taste, and fashionâ'tis a blaze Which so reminds him of his better days, That fond regrets, with gratitude sincere, Are mingled in the language of a tear. And as the worn âwar-horse,â at the trumpet shrill, Leaps o'er each barrier that restrains his will, Impatient still to claim the hero's right, The foremost post amid the desperate fight; So comes our monarch of a former age, Again to claim his empire o'er the stage, From tyro potentates this truth to wring, He was and is âin every inch a king;â With one bright flash renew th' expiring flame, And gild the trophies round his honored name. EPILOGUE, TO COX'S OPERA OF ROKEBY. SPOKEN BY BARNES, PLACIDE, AND HILSON. Enter Barnes, in character of a Physician. Barnes. Oh, spare your handsâ'tis useless, all this blarney, The play can't live, without a word from Barney: 'Tis like a patientâquacks to death may steam him, And he is damned, if science don't redeem him. Grappling with fate, 'tis I alone can part 'emâ Barney will save the piece, secundem artem. Go onâthat's rightâyour smiles are what I'm afterâ The best prescription is a roar of laughter; One hearty laugh, no matter how excited, May save a life when every hope is blighted. 'Tis true, Placide has got an epilogue, But 'taint the thingâit don't âgo the whole hog;â So, while he's back there, spelling out each line, I'll give you an extrumpery of mine; Original throughoutâno one has read itâ So, if you have a tear, prepare to shed it. âA certain fair oneâonce, in days of yoreâ Caught a bad quinsy, and her throat was sore; She could not speak, nor swallow, chew nor sup, She scarcely breathedâthe doctors gave her up! Her weeping friends, in silence, breathed their sighs, And stood prepared to close her fading eyes! 'Twas at this awful crisis, 'mid the gloom, Her favorite monkey stole into the room; With doctor's formal air approached the bed, Seized hold her wrist, then gravely shook his head! The droll manÅuvre called a smile from death, And one convulsive laugh restored her breath; Broke her disorder, let the fair escape, Who owed her cure alone to Dr. Ape.â D'ye take?âor must I give your wits a jog? Stayâhere comes Harry, with his epilogue. Enter Placide, who comes forward and speaks. Placide. âIn ancient times, when plighted vows were brokenââ Barnes. You're too late, Halâthe epilogue is spoken. Placide. Spoken! By whom? Barnes. By me. Placide. By you! Barnes. 'Tis certain. Placide. Why 'taint a minute since they dropt the curtain, And my address a good half hour employs. Barnes. I've done the deedâdidst thou not hear a noise? If you attempt, you'll find yourself mistaken; I made them laughâthat saved the author's bacon. Placide. And who bade you display your monkey capers? The sun requires no aid from farthing tapersâ I saved the piece, sir. Barnes. You! Placide. My humble talents Secured the thing's success, and turned the balance; Or, as Prince Rupert saysââalone I did it!â It's true, I pledge my honor! Enter Hilson, speaking. Hilson. Heaven, forbid it! To put so mere a trifle âup the spout!â Placide. Hilson, be quiet! I know what I'm about. Hilson. That tone, my boy, smacks sharply of the acid. Barnes. Placide by name, but not exactly placid. You're somewhat wroth. Placide. I amâand shall be wrotherâ I'll speak my speech! Hilson. Not if you love the author. Since I have saved his opera, 'twere wrong To jeopardize it with a speech so long. Placide. You saved the opera! Barnes. You saved it! Both. You! Hilson. Yes, I myself aloneâyou know it's true; I hit it on the headâand, lest it fail, Here's a short epilogue, to clinch the nail: Addressing the Audience. âWhen erst the muses, on Parnassus' top, In mazy dancesââ Barnes. Prithee, Tommy, stop; Throw poetry and physic to the dogs, Nor bore our friends, here, with dull epilogues. Hilson. Agreed, old Barney!âand, to end disputes, The readiest way to harmonize our flutes Is to admitâso be it understood, To please our friends we've all done what we could. If we have failedâ Placide. Why, thenâ Barnes. What, then, Placide? Placide. They'll take a good intention for the deed. Hilson. I'll answer for 'tâI know these gen'rous folks, They 're always laughing at us, or our jokes. But what of our young author?âJests nor wit Won't add a penny to his benefit. Placide. His benefit is safe. Barnes. What then of Rokeby? Hilson. Should that be damned it would a serious joke be. But see!âthere's mercy in each judge's eyeâ The bard's acquitted!âRokeby shall not die! Placide. Egad! their plaudits make old Drury shake! Hilson. It's just the thing! Barnes. I sayââthere's no mistake!â ACROSTICS. IN AN ALBUM. Just emblems of your minds, these leaves I view, As yet unwritten, and unsullied too; Now guard them wellânor let the hand of art Ere cast a blot upon the book or heart. Each is now openâwatch them both with care, Lest truant thoughts and wishes enter there; Invite the good, the talented and wise, Zealous in virtue's cause, their numbers prize; Avoid the bad, the doubtful, and the rashâ Better remain a blank than teem with trash. Endeavor still from Truth's exhaustless store, To cull the choicest of her precious oreâ Hearts thus endued, are rich for ever more. Maidens, this book must a memorial be A dear lamented parents' legacy; Remember when you taste its fragrant flowers Gathered by fancy from the loveliest bowers, Affection, duty, sorrow, all combined, Require the tribute of a grateful mind; Embrace, dear girls, the yielding moment, then, To con parental counsel o'er again. SCIENCE AND GENIUS HAPPILY COMBINED. Science and genius happily combined, Adorn, enrich, and elevate his mind; Moulded by Nature in her happiest mood, Unawed by threats, by flattery unsubdued; Each social virtue warms his generous breast, Lives in his acts, and renders others blest. Modest of worth that wins unnumbered hearts, An artist and a patron of the arts; Void of a wish another's fame to dim, Envious of none, though thousands envy him; Richly endowed with every mental grace, Indulgent Heaven can give the human race; Celestial truth completes the perfect planâ Know you the picture?âMaverick is the man. ALTHOUGH, DEAR GIRL. Although, dear girl, an envious length of space Between us lies, which fancy dreads to trace, Believe me, though we dwell so far apart, You never can be absent from my heart. Buoyant with hopes, and innocence combined, Rich in endowments of the form and mind; Youth, beauty, fortune, friends, and kindred dear, All, all conspire thy morn of life to cheer; Nature and art unite their varied powers, To wreath thy brow, and strew thy path with flowers. Warmly the wish is flowing from thy breast, Oh may you thus be long and truly blest; On thy young heart, may heaven's approving smile, Dawn, like a sunbeam on some flowery isle, Where naught but peace and pleasure dare intrude, Or interrupt the sacred solitude. Rich in like virtues, may thy lover's breast, Treasure thine image as its only guestâ Heaven will approve, and both be doubly blest. ART THOU, DEAR NIECE. Art thou, dear niece, in life's young bloom, Now, ere the scene is dressed in gloom, Neglectful of those flowers of mirth, Meant to refresh our minds on earth? Art thou, so young, so fair in truth, Regardless of the joys of youth, Intended in our path below, As antidotes to human wo? Waste not thy youth, thy health, and bloom, On themes of sorrow, doubt, and gloom; Our earthly joys, in mercy given, Do not retard our course to heaven. Wear in thy face the cheerful smile, Of innocence, devoid of guile; Revere and worship with the heart, The eyes and lips may still impart Hope's sparkling ray, joy's silver tone, The good are cheerfulâthey alone. EPITAPHâACROSTIC. When virtuous souls throw off their robes of clay, Invited home to realms of endless day, Lingering behind, affection, drowned in grief, Looks round in vain, despairing of relief; Impatient of the chastisement, we mourn, And grieve for pleasures that no more return; Mingling our tears upon the senseless urn. But we forget that virtue can not die, Eternal joys now bless our friend on high; The soul still lives far from this clayey bed, He is not here, but risen from the dead. Ere we are called to lay these bodies by, Let us his virtues imitate, and try, Like him to live, and then like him to die. ELEGIAC ACROSTIC. Joined with his kindred spirits in the sky, Oh, wherefore wish him back again to die? Here all is pain, or transitory joy, Nothing can there his perfect bliss alloy. Rich in the best endowments of the mind, Imbued with virtues of the gentlest kind, Cheerful he journeyed through this chequered wild, Honest, sincere, benevolent, and mild, As husband, father, friend, he filled his part, Religious smile the sunshine of the heart, Death came to him the messenger of love, Sent to conduct him to his home above.</field>
