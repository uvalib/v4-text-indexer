      <field name="fulltext">DAWN IN THE HIGHLANDS OF THE HUDSON. The opening eyelids of the waking morn Now o'er the drowsy world begin to wink, While the bright lustres that the skies adorn, Before the coming glory, pale and shrink. High in the East, yon shadowy fleece of clouds, Edged with a rosy tint, begins to glow, While darkling mist the humbler landscape shrouds, Veiling the beauties of the world below; Save where yon wood-crowned peak is seen to rise, Like giant towering in majestic height, Lifting its gilded head amid the skies, Beyond the rolling scud's fantastic flight. No songster carols from his lonely bower; No insect chirps along the meadow green; No sound of life disturbs the quiet hour, And silence reigns o'er all the Sabbath scene; Save, ever and anon, some wakeful bird Twitters a welcome to the blue-eyed dawn; Or some full-uddered cow afar is heard, Calling the lagging milkmaid to the lawn. But see! the sun through yon deep cleft appears, Careering masterful into the sky! His presence all the world of nature cheers, And wakes the woodland's mingled melody. At once the air is vocal with the strain That quavers through the valleys far and wide, Along the bubbling brooks, the jewelled plain, Deep in the glen, and up the mountain side. A swarm of bustling insects speed away On pleasant tour of merry morning flight, And sport and glitter in the sunny ray, Or revel 'mid the flowers in full delight. The ever-busy bee is on the wing, Eager to quaff his cup of honeyed dew Where roses wild in red luxuriance spring, And oft his luscious morning draught renew. The envious mists, whose unsubstantial veil Drooped o'er the face of nature, upward fly, Athwart the mountain's brow like spectres quail, And give the laughing landscape to the eye. Slowly its beauties open to my view; One at a time its blushing charms unfold; And nature, to her sex's maxim true, With sweet delay permits me to behold. Like some capricious beauty, she awhile Hides the full magic of her winning face, The pouting ruby lip, the dimpled smile, And all her youthful, soft, bewitching, grace, Till, as by chance, the veil is blown aside, And lo! the glowing cheek, the sparkling eye, The snowy neck, by happy chance are spied, Blended in one delicious harmony. Thus nature coquets with the lord of day; Now shrouds her face in mist, and now appears Enwrapped in gloom, or pranked in colors gay; Now glowing joyously, and now all tears. The goddess still her loveliness renews In twilight gravity or morning play, Or, 'mid the silent stars and noiseless dews, When night's pale regent holds her lonely sway. Whether in balmy Spring, bedecked with flowers, And bright with smiles, she shows her ruddy face, Or panting in her sultry Summer bowers, Or clothed in Autumn's many-colored grace, Or e'en when rigorous Winter rides the air, His snowy beard wild streaming to the wind, Now wrapt in clouds, and now with angry glare Chiding the storm for lingering behind; Still there is something in her glorious plan That wakes our noblest thoughts, and lifts the soul To Him who gave the wondrous work to man, And with it feeling to enjoy the whole. THE SUMMER MORN. Twilight lingers dim and deep, Hushing earth in dewy sleep; Till along the amber sky Morning's fiery arrows fly, And in a slow-surging fold From the land the mist is rolled, Nature's gorgeous theatre; Showing splendors far and near, Solemn wood, and sheltered bay, Where some weary bark, that lay All night neighbored by the bank, Through the willows clustering dank Shines along with hollow sail, Shifting to the morning gale. Village sounds are waking now: Birds are singing on the bough; Through the hoary umbraged oak Slowly curls the cottage smoke; To the forest far and gray Chants the woodman on his way. Now the fisher through the pool Woodbine-shaded, clear and cool, Where, by moss and tufted weed Loves the speckled trout to feed, Wades with cautious step and eye, Flinging oft the gilded fly; Yet, with deep-delighted ear, Pausing in his sport, to hear Where the milkmaid's merry song Rings the primrose path along, Some sweet measure of the time When the heart was in the rhyme; Or, along the distant hill, Softened comes the whistle shrill, Telling where, beside his team, (That, ascending in the beam, Like a fiery troop appear), Toils the early wagoner! Sights like these let sluggards scornâ Joy is in the Summer Morn. ANADOSTAN. There is a little grassy isle That parts Potomac's ample tide, Where nature wears her gayest smile, And nature's choicest sweets abide. On either side, and all around, The weltering wave is seen to flow, Noiseless, or, if you hear a sound, 'Tis but a murmur, soft and low. With the thick groves the gentle flood Playing at hide and seek appears, Now glittering through the waving wood, Now lost as one its margin nears. It seems as nought but holy rest Could find a home in that fair spot; It seems as mortal might be blessed, If there were cast his happy lot. There's not a sound that greets the ear But lulls the worn and weary soul; There's not a sight that meets us here But calms the breast where passions roll. The great trees, nodding to and fro In stately conclaves not a few, Whisper as secretly and slow As bashful lovers ever do. The wild birds sing their roundelay, For no rude sportsman spoils their glee, And, all the live-long summer day, Delight the ear with minstrelsy. And careless up and down they fly, Nor heed the stranger passing near; For undisturbed they cleave the sky, And undisturbed their young they rear. And oh! how sweet the roses bloom, And sweet the ruddy clover spreads; And, springing from earth's fruitful womb, How thick the violets lift their heads! And, when the sun's last splendors beam Upon the light clouds in the West, The glassy surface of the stream What ever changing tints invest! At first a gorgeous red prevails; And next, a glowing purple hue; To feebler gleams the glory pales; Then comes a deep, fast-fading, blue. Then idles in the pensive hour, When Twilight, wrapped in robe of gray, Steals softly from her secret bower, And shuts the gates of parting day. Then hies the fire-fly gayly out, And trims his lamp at evening's fall, To light the little rabble rout Of Fairies to their nightly ball. The tinkling bell, the plashing oar, The buzzing of the insect throng, The laugh that echoes from the shore, The unseen thrush's vesper songâ Combined with the mild influence Of sober Evening's matron sway, 'Gainst worldly wish give strong defence, And chase all sinful thought away. At such an hour I long to rove Along the paths of that fair isle, With those who simple nature love, Those who, like Nature, know no guile. And I, at such an hour have roved Along the paths of that fair isle, With one who simple nature loved, One who, like Nature, knew no guile; With one whose eye of modest blue Beamed ever with a radiance bright That seemed to something inward due, A fountain of celestial light; With one whose voice was sweeter far, As I one eve enjoyed it there, Than all the singing birds there are, Or all the sounds that soothe the air; With one whose lips outblushed the rose, And forth a fresher perfume breathed Than e'er the rose at evening close To dewy stars of night bequeathed; With one whose bosom was more pure Than the pure stream that wandered by; In its own innocence secure, And safe, were basest evil nigh. When faintly beamed the setting sun Along the paths of that fair isle, Once I have strayed with such an one, And heard her gayly talk the while. And when I count the earthly hours That I shall cherish most of all, That walk in Anadostan's bowers Will be the first that I recall. LOST! Once on a time a traveller wound his way Far in the West, that world of boundless plains, And endless rivers that meandering stray Through the wild warrior-Indian's lone domains, Where Nature in despotic vigor reigns, The freshness of her power undefiled By mortal man in search of petty gains, Unmarred by frippery Art, sublimely wild, Unrivalled and supreme, Creation's giant child. Tracking the prairie, he had left afar Turbid Missouri's rash and headstrong tide, That ever with its neighbor Earth at war Resistless tears its way in foaming pride, Rending her breast to atoms far and wide, To scatter them at random to and fro, Just as its rage, or accident, may guide; Capricious in its rude relentless flow, Robbing a world above, to form a world below. 'Twas Autumn, and the dim and hazy air Diffused a double softness o'er the scene, That made the landscape more obscurely fair, And waked seducing indolence I ween, And caused him pause each lagging step between; Far as he gazed o'er all the boundless space That mocked his vision though his eye was keen, On every hand dame Nature showed a face Of most contented calm, and soft, bewitching, grace. Here drowsy-headed Silence held her breath, And Echo lay entranced in heavy sleep; The quiet and solemnity of Death Eternal watch and ward appeared to keep, And palpably upon the air to creep; And naught rebelled against the strong duress; No insect shrill was heard, or murmur deep; In truth, it was a stillness to oppressâ Unbroken, dreary, sole, and utter, loneliness. And not a trace of man here could he glean, Though eagerly he cast his wearied eyes O'er the mysterious paradise of green; But saw, instead, far off, weird phantoms rise, Dancing against the mirror of the skies;â City, and tower, and frowning battlement; And lengthened lines of men in martial guise; And thousand unsubstantial figments, blent In dizzy Fancy's wayward wild divertisement. The skies their dark-blue banner broad unfurled, Watched by the sleepless sentinels of night, While all the upper and the lower world Blended in one pale harmony of light, Might fill the Soul with music, to that height Which bards declare was reached in olden time When all those heavenly orbs serenely bright Joined in one solemn, soul-subduing chime, Uplifting praise unto their Architect sublime. But not for him was joy by night or day, Though all the joys of sight and sound should meet; Cold in his heart a grim suspicion lay; âI'm on the trailâthe trail!ââwould he repeat, And, for awhile, his growing fear would cheat, And make himself a self-deceiving boast; But not for long endured the poor deceit; Upon a sea of doubt and terror tost, That most tremendous horror came upon himâLost! THE OLD MAN'S CAROUSAL. Drink! drink! to whom shall we drink? To friend or a mistress? Come, let me think! To those who are absent, or those who are here? To the dead that we loved, or the living still dear? Alas! when I look, I find none of the last! The present is barrenâlet's drink to the past. Come! here's to the girl with a voice sweet and low, The eye all of fire and the bosom of snow, Who erewhile in the days of my youth that are fled, Once slept on my bosom, and pillowed my head! Would you know where to find such a delicate prize? Go seek in yon church-yard, for there she lies. And here's to the friend, the one friend of my youth, With a head full of genius, a heart full of truth, Who travelled with me in the sunshine of life, And stood by my side in its peace and its strife! Would you know where to seek a blessing so rare? Go drag the lone sea, you may find him there. And here's to a brace of twin cherubs of mine, With hearts like their mother's, as pure as this wine, Who came but to see the first act of the play, Grew tired of the scene, and then both went away. Would you know where this brace of bright cherubs have hied? Go seek them in heaven, for there they abide. A bumper, my boys! to a gray-headed pair, Who watched o'er my childhood with tenderest care; God bless them, and keep them, and may they look down On the head of their son, without tear, sigh, or frown! Would you know whom I drink to? go seek 'mid the dead, You will find both their names on the stone at their head. And here'sâbut, alas! the good wine is no more, The bottle is emptied of all its bright store; Like those we have toasted, its spirit has fled, And nothing is left of the light that is shed. Then, a bumper of tears, boys! the banquet here ends, With a health to our dead, since we've no living friends. THE OLD MAN'S BLESSINGS. âHonor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.â You think, because I'm fourscore years, And halt a little in my gait, My life is one of cares and fears, And that no blessings on me wait; You think I sigh for days long past, When Hope his lamp bright beaming bore, When all was light from first to last, And not a shadow loomed before; That, 'stead of this young phantom dear, Lighting my path as on I stray, The spectres foul of guilt and fear Are my companions on the way; That nothing now to me is left, But patience to endure the load Of added years, each one bereft Of blessings which the last bestowed. But trust me, friend, it is not so; Age has of joys its hidden store, As rich as youth can e'er bestow, Which memory reckons o'er and o'er. Remember that the withered leaf, Just ere it falls to rise no more, Discloses, for a period brief, A brighter tint than e'er it wore. Remember, too, in the command, Those who their parents honor here, Shall live long in the promised land, And revel in its bounteous cheer. Old age must then a blessing be, Since 'tis the boon which God doth give To those whose filial piety Merits the chosen bliss, to live. What though my head is white as snow, My forehead ploughed in many a furrow, My body bent like Indian bow, And I a stick am fain to borrow! What though my sight begins to fade! I still can find my way alongâ What though my hearing is decayed! I still can hear the woodland song. And though young Fancy's feasts are o'er, I am not yet condemned to fast; Drawing from Memory's ample store As rich a treat as Hope's repast. As o'er my shoulder back I peer, I see no spectre's ghastly grin, No scowling imps of guilt or fear, Born of, and now avenging, Sin. Some marks there are, I must confess, Long time chalked up behind the doorâ Some old offenses, more or less, I wish were rubbed from out the score. But He who gave His blood for all, I hope has shed one drop for me, When He atoned for Adam's fall, On the high cross of Calvary. This world is still a cheerful scene, The sunshine still is clear and bright; The waving woods and meadows green Still give my heart a mild delight. 'Tis like the summer twilight eve; Though not so bright as morning's ray, Yet soft and sweet, and hard to leave As the more gorgeous tints of day. What though grim death, with iron hand, Hath severed many a kindly tie, And many of my kindred band In yonder church-yard mouldering lie; Old friendsâa fewâstill hover near, Nursing, like me, the feeble flame, Who, though they all new faces wear, Are still in heart and soul the same. And best of all, a little band Of noisy imps climb up my knees, And ramble with me, hand in hand, Along the brook, among the trees. The old trunk, though its limbs decay, Puts forth new shoots from year to year, And 'neath its shadows, rich and gay The grass upsprings, the flowers appear. Then why should I of age complain? If 'tis a punishment to prove, God would not promise it to man As a reward of filial love. Content to live, content to die, I care not when king death appears; But, if 'tis God's good pleasure, I Don't fear to live an hundred years. THE FLIGHT OF TIME. Time flies with youth, writes many a sage, But old men know time flies with age. Still swifter roll the passing years, As near our journey's end appears; The closer we approach our homes, The down-hill course more fleet becomes. Just as the weary, worn-out, nag, Whose strength is gone, whose spirits flag, Pricks up his ears, and mends his pace, At sight of his night's resting place. THE DESOLATE OLD MAN. Videlicet H. S. I'm weary, yet I cannot sleep; I can not laugh, nor can I weep; I suffer little, less enjoy; Ease wearies me, and cares annoy. I stand, a withered trunk, alone, My roots decayed, my limbs all gone. Those whom I loved have passed away, And those who loved meâwhere are they? The past is one wide desert drear, The future an approaching bier. Strange that in living we outlive All that in life can pleasure give! And strange that still we linger here, Not lured by hope, but checked by fear; Not that this gloomy world we love, But know not what the next may prove. THE POET'S LAST STRAIN. So sings the gray-haired bard his dying strain; On earth he never will be heard again. His fingers tremble as he sweeps the lyre, And the chill damps of age have quenched his fire; The starry hosts of Heaven fade away, The sun grows dim, 'tis twilight all the day; Nature is bed-rid, and no more displays Fresh beauties to his weak, bewildered, gaze; Spring, Summer, Autumn, all the same appear; With him 'tis Winter through the livelong year. He scarce can hear the warbler forest-free Trilling his merry song from the old tree Whose weather-beaten bark and leafless limb Seem types of Death, aye whispering to him A dreary warning, and mysterious call To that long home, the biding place of all. Yet may we hope that though his voice be still For ever by the woodland and the rill, Perchance it may be heard in Heavenly choir, Quickened anew by an ethereal fire, Hymning high anthems at the awful throne Of Him who rules the Universe, alone.</field>
