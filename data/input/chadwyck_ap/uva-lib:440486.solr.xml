I. SUNRISE. In my sleep I was fain of their fellowship, fain Of the live-oak, the marsh, and the main. The little green leaves would not let me alone in my sleep; Up-breathed from the marshes, a message of range and of sweep, Interwoven with waftures of wild sea-liberties, drifting, Came through the lapped leaves sifting, sifting, Came to the gates of sleep. Then my thoughts, in the dark of the dungeon-keep Of the Castle of Captives hid in the City of Sleep, Upstarted, by twos and by threes assembling: The gates of sleep fell a-trembling Like as the lips of a lady that forth falter yes, Shaken with happiness: The gates of sleep stood wide. I have waked, I have come, my beloved! I might not abide: I have come ere the dawn, O beloved, my live-oaks, to hide In your gospelling glooms,âto be As a lover in heaven, the marsh my marsh and the sea my sea. Tell me, sweet burly-bark'd, man-bodied Tree That mine arms in the dark are embracing, dost know From what fount are these tears at thy feet which flow? They rise not from reason, but deeper inconsequent deeps. Reason 's not one that weeps. What logic of greeting lies Betwixt dear over-beautiful trees and the rain of the eyes? O cunning green leaves, little masters! like as ye gloss All the dull-tissued dark with your luminous darks that emboss The vague blackness of night into pattern and plan, So, (But would I could know, but would I could know,) With your question embroid'ring the dark of the question of man,â So, with your silences purfling this silence of man While his cry to the dead for some knowledge is under the ban, Under the ban,â So, ye have wrought me Designs on the night of our knowledge,âyea, ye have taught me, So, That haply we know somewhat more than we know. Ye lispers, whisperers, singers in storms, Ye consciences murmuring faiths under forms, Ye ministers meet for each passion that grieves, Friendly, sisterly, sweetheart leaves, Oh, rain me down from your darks that contain me Wisdoms ye winnow from winds that pain me,â Sift down tremors of sweet-within-sweet That advise me of more than they bring,ârepeat Me the woods-smell that swiftly but now brought breath From the heaven-side bank of the river of death,â Teach me the terms of silence,âpreach me The passion of patience,âsift me,âimpeach me,â And there, oh there As ye hang with your myriad palms upturned in the air, Pray me a myriad prayer. My gossip, the owl,âis it thou That out of the leaves of the low-hanging bough, As I pass to the beach, art stirred? Dumb woods, have ye uttered a bird? Reverend Marsh, low-couched along the sea, Old chemist, rapt in alchemy, Distilling silence,âlo, That which our father-age had died to knowâ The menstruum that dissolves all matterâthou Hast found it: for this silence, filling now The globÃ©d clarity of receiving space, This solves us all: man, matter, doubt, disgrace, Death, love, sin, sanity, Must in yon silence' clear solution lie. Too clear! That crystal nothing who'll peruse? The blackest night could bring us brighter news. Yet precious qualities of silence haunt Round these vast margins, ministrant. Oh, if thy soul's at latter gasp for space, With trying to breathe no bigger than thy race Just to be fellow'd, when that thou hast found No man with room, or grace enough of bound To entertain that New thou tell'st, thou art,â 'Tis here, 'tis here thou canst unhand thy heart And breathe it free, and breathe it free, By rangy marsh, in lone sea-liberty. The tide 's at full: the marsh with flooded streams Glimmers, a limpid labyrinth of dreams. Each winding creek in grave entrancement lies A rhapsody of morning-stars. The skies Shine scant with one forked galaxy,â The marsh brags ten: looped on his breast they lie. Oh, what if a sound should be made! Oh, what if a bound should be laid To this bow-and-string tension of beauty and silence a-spring,â To the bend of beauty the bow, or the hold of silence the string! I fear me, I fear me yon dome of diaphanous gleam Will break as a bubble o'er-blown in a dream,â Yon dome of too-tenuous tissues of space and of night, Over-weighted with stars, over-freighted with light, Over-sated with beauty and silence, will seem But a bubble that broke in a dream, If a bound of degree to this grace be laid, Or a sound or a motion made. But no: it is made: list! somewhere,âmystery, where? In the leaves? in the air? In my heart? is a motion made: 'Tis a motion of dawn, like a flicker of shade on shade. In the leaves 'tis palpable: low multitudinous stirring Upwinds through the woods; the little ones, softly conferring, Have settled my lord's to be looked for; so; they are still; But the air and my heart and the earth are a-thrill,â And look where the wild duck sails round the bend of the river,â And look where a passionate shiver Expectant is bending the blades Of the marsh-grass in serial shimmers and shades,â And invisible wings, fast fleeting, fast fleeting, Are beating The dark overhead as my heart beats,âand steady and free Is the ebb-tide flowing from marsh to seaâ (Run home, little streams, With your lapfulls of stars and dreams),â And a sailor unseen is hoisting a-peak, For list, down the inshore curve of the creek How merrily flutters the sail,â And lo, in the East! Will the East unveil? The East is unveiled, the East hath confessed A flush: 'tis dead; 'tis alive: 'tis dead, ere the West Was aware of it: nay, 'tis abiding, 'tis unwithdrawn: Have a care, sweet Heaven! 'Tis Dawn. Now a dream of a flame through that dream of a flush is up rolled: To the zenith ascending, a dome of undazzling gold Is builded, in shape as a bee-hive, from out of the sea: The hive is of gold undazzling, but oh, the Bee, The star-fed Bee, the build-fire Bee, Of dazzling gold is the great Sun-Bee That shall flash from the hive-hole over the sea. Yet now the dew-drop, now the morning gray, Shall live their little lucid sober day Ere with the sun their souls exhale away. Now in each pettiest personal sphere of dew The summ'd morn shines complete as in the blue Big dew-drop of all heaven: with these lit shrines O'er-silvered to the farthest sea-confines, The sacramental marsh one pious plain Of worship lies. Peace to the ante-reign Of Mary Morning, blissful mother mild, Minded of nought but peace, and of a child. Not slower than Majesty moves, for a mean and a measure Of motion,ânot faster than dateless Olympian leisure Might pace with unblown ample garments from pleasure to pleasure,â The wave-serrate sea-rim sinks unjarring, unreeling, Forever revealing, revealing, revealing, Edgewise, bladewise, halfwise, wholewise,â'tis done! Good-morrow, lord Sun! With several voice, with ascription one, The woods and the marsh and the sea and my soul Unto thee, whence the glittering stream of all morrows doth roll, Cry good and past-good and most heavenly morrow, lord Sun. O Artisan born in the purple,âWorkman Heat,â Parter of passionate atoms that travail to meet And be mixed in the death-cold oneness,âinnermost Guest At the marriage of elements,âfellow of publicans,âblest King in the blouse of flame, that loiterest o'er The idle skies yet laborest fast evermore,â Thou, in the fine forge-thunder, thou, in the beat Of the heart of a man, thou Motive,âLaborer Heat: Yea, Artist, thou, of whose art yon sea 's all news, With his inshore greens and manifold mid-sea blues, Pearl-glint, shell-tint, ancientest perfectest hues Ever shaming the maidens,âlily and rose Confess thee, and each mild flame that glows In the clarified virginal bosoms of stones that shine, It is thine, it is thine: Thou chemist of storms, whether driving the winds a-swirl Or a-flicker the subtiler essences polar that whirl In the magnet earth,âyea, thou with a storm for a heart, Rent with debate, many-spotted with question, part From part oft sundered, yet ever a globÃ©d light, Yet ever the artist, ever more large and bright Than the eye of a man may avail of:âmanifold One, I must pass from thy face, I must pass from the face of the Sun: Old Want is awake and agog, every wrinkle a-frown; The worker must pass to his work in the terrible town: But I fear not, nay, and I fear not the thing to be done; I am strong with the strength of my lord the Sun: How dark, how dark soever the race that must needs be run, I am lit with the Sun. Oh, never the mast-high run of the seas Of traffic shall hide thee, Never the hell-colored smoke of the factories Hide thee, Never the reek of the time 's fen-politics Hide thee, And ever my heart through the night shall with knowledge abide thee, And ever by day shall my spirit, as one that hath tried thee, Labor, at leisure, in art,âtill yonder beside thee My soul shall float, friend Sun, The day being done. Baltimore, December, 1880. II. INDIVIDUALITY. Sail on, sail on, fair cousin Cloud: Oh loiter hither from the sea. Still-eyed and shadow-brow'd, Steal off from yon far-drifting crowd, And come and brood upon the marsh with me. Yon laboring low horizon-smoke, Yon stringent sail, toil not for thee Nor me; did heaven's stroke The whole deep with drown'd commerce choke, No pitiless tease of risk or bottomry Would to thy rainy office close Thy will, or lock mine eyes from tears, Part wept for traders'-woes, Part for that ventures mean as those In issue bind such sovereign hopes and fears. âLo, Cloud, thy downward countenance stares Blank on the blank-faced marsh, and thou Mindest of dark affairs; Thy substance seems a warp of cares; Like late wounds run the wrinkles on thy brow. Well may'st thou pause, and gloom, and stare, A visible conscience: I arraign Thee, criminal Cloud, of rare Contempts on Mercy, Right, and Prayer,â Of murders, arsons, thefts,âof nameless stain Pass, kinsman Cloud, now fair and mild: Discharge the will that 's not thine own. I work in freedom wild, But work, as plays a little child, Sure of the Father, Self, and Love, alone. Baltimore, 1878â9. III. MARSH SONGâAT SUNSET. Over the monstrous shambling sea, Over the Caliban sea, Bright Ariel-cloud, thou lingerest: Oh wait, oh wait, in the warm red West,â Thy Prospero I'll be. Over the humped and fishy sea, Over the Caliban sea O cloud in the West, like a thought in the heart Of pardon, loose thy wing, and start, And do a grace for me. Over the huge and huddling sea, Over the Caliban sea, Bring hither my brother Antonio,âMan,â My injurer: night breaks the ban: Brother, I pardon thee. Baltimore, 1879â80. IV. THE MARSHES OF GLYNN. Glooms of the live-oaks, beautiful-braided and woven With intricate shades of the vines that myriad-cloven Clamber the forks of the multiform boughs,â Emerald twilights,â Virginal shy lights, Wrought of the leaves to allure to the whisper of vows, When lovers pace timidly down through the green colon nades Of the dim sweet woods, of the dear dark woods, Of the heavenly woods and glades, That run to the radiant marginal sand-beach within The wide sea-marshes of Glynn;â Beautiful glooms, soft dusks in the noon-day fire,â Wildwood privacies, closets of lone desire, Chamber from chamber parted with wavering arras of leaves,â Cells for the passionate pleasure of prayer to the soul that grieves, Pure with a sense of the passing of saints through the wood, Cool for the dutiful weighing of ill with good;â O braided dusks of the oak and woven shades of the vine, While the riotous noon-day sun of the June-day long did shine Ye held me fast in your heart and I held you fast in mine: But now when the noon is no more, and riot is rest, And the sun is a-wait at the ponderous gate of the West, And the slant yellow beam down the wood-aisle doth seem Like a lane into heaven that leads from a dream,â Ay, now, when my soul all day hath drunken the soul of the oak, And my heart is at ease from men, and the wearisome sound of the stroke Of the scythe of time and the trowel of trade is low, And belief overmasters doubt, and I know that I know, And my spirit is grown to a lordly great compass within, That the length and the breadth and the sweep of the marshes of Glynn Will work me no fear like the fear they have wrought me of yore When length was fatigue, and when breadth was but bitterness sore, And when terror and shrinking and dreary unnamable pain Drew over me out of the merciless miles of the plain,â Oh, now, unafraid, I am fain to face The vast sweet visage of space. To the edge of the wood I am drawn, I am drawn, Where the gray beach glimmering runs, as a belt of the dawn, For a mete and a mark To the forest-dark:â So: Affable live-oak, leaning low,â Thusâwith your favorâsoft, with a reverent hand, (Not lightly touching your person, Lord of the land!) Bending your beauty aside, with a step I stand On the firm-packed sand, Free By a world of marsh that borders a world of sea. Sinuous southward and sinuous northward the shimmering band Of the sand-beach fastens the fringe of the marsh to the folds of the land. Inward and outward to northward and southward the beach-lines linger and curl As a silver-wrought garment that clings to and follows the firm sweet limbs of a girl. Vanishing, swerving, evermore curving again into sight, Softly the sand-beach wavers away to a dim gray looping of light. And what if behind me to westward the wall of the woods stands high? The world lies east: how ample, the marsh and the sea and the sky! A league and a league of marsh-grass, waist-high, broad in the blade, Green, and all of a height, and unflecked with a light or a shade, Stretch leisurely off, in a pleasant plain, To the terminal blue of the main. Oh, what is abroad in the marsh and the terminal sea? Somehow my soul seems suddenly free From the weighing of fate and the sad discussion of sin, By the length and the breadth and the sweep of the marshes of Glynn. Ye marshes, how candid and simple and nothing-withholding and free Ye publish yourselves to the sky and offer yourselves to the sea! Tolerant plains, that suffer the sea and the rains and the sun, Ye spread and span like the catholic man who hath mightily won God out of knowledge and good out of infinite pain And sight out of blindness and purity out of a stain. As the marsh-hen secretly builds on the watery sod, Behold I will build me a nest on the greatness of God: I will fly in the greatness of God as the marsh-hen flies In the freedom that fills all the space 'twixt the marsh and the skies: By so many roots as the marsh-grass sends in the sod I will heartily lay me a-hold on the greatness of God: Oh, like to the greatness of God is the greatness within The range of the marshes, the liberal marshes of Glynn. And the sea lends large, as the marsh: lo, out of his plenty the sea Pours fast: full soon the time of the flood-tide must be: Look how the grace of the sea doth go About and about through the intricate channels that flow Here and there, Everywhere, Till his waters have flooded the uttermost creeks and the low-lying lanes, And the marsh is meshed with a million veins, That like as with rosy and silvery essences flow In the rose-and-silver evening glow. Farewell, my lord Sun! The creeks overflow: a thousand rivulets run 'Twixt the roots of the sod; the blades of the marsh-grass stir; Passeth a hurrying sound of wings that westward whirr; Passeth, and all is still; and the currents cease to run; And the sea and the marsh are one. How still the plains of the waters be! The tide is in his ecstasy. The tide is at his highest height: And it is night. And now from the Vast of the Lord will the waters of sleep Roll in on the souls of men, But who will reveal to our waking ken The forms that swim and the shapes that creep Under the waters of sleep? And I would I could know what swimmeth below when the tide comes in On the length and the breadth of the marvellous marshes of Glynn. Baltimore, 1878. Yet though life's logic grow as gray (Yet though life's logic grow as gray As thou, my soul 's not in eclipse.) Cold Cloud, but yesterday Thy lightning slew a child at play, And then a priest with prayers upon his lips For his enemies, and then a bright Lady that did but ope the door Upon the storming night To let a beggar in,âstrange spite,â And then thy sulky rain refused to pour Till thy quick torch a barn had burned Where twelve months' store of victual lay, A widow's sons had earned; Which done, thy floods with winds returned,â The river raped their little herd away. What myriad righteous errands high Thy flames might run on! In that hour Thou slewest the child, oh why Not rather slay Calamity, Breeder of Pain and Doubt, infernal Power? Or why not plunge thy blades about Some maggot politician throng Swarming to parcel out The body of a land, and rout The maw-conventicle, and ungorge Wrong? What the cloud doeth The Lord knoweth, The cloud knoweth not. What the artist doeth, The Lord knoweth; Knoweth the artist not? Well-answered!âO dear artists, ye âWhether in forms of curve or hue Or tone your gospels beâ Say wrong This work is not of me, But God: it is not true, it is not true. Awful is Art because 'tis free. The artist trembles o'er his plan Where men his Self must see. Who made a song or picture, he Did it, and not another, God nor man. My Lord is large, my Lord is strong: Giving, He gave: my me is mine. How poor, how strange, how wrong, To dream He wrote the little song I made to Him with love's unforced design! Oh, not as clouds dim laws have plann'd To strike down Good and fight for Ill,â Oh, not as harps that stand In the wind and sound the wind's command: Each artistâgift of terror!âowns his will. For thee, Cloud,âif thou spend thine all Upon the South's o'er-brimming sea That needs thee not; or crawl To the dry provinces, and fall Till every convert clod shall give to thee Green worship; if thou grow or fade, Bring on delight or misery, Fly east or west, be made Snow, hail, rain, wind, grass, rose, light, shade; What matters it to thee? There is no thee. CLOVER. INSCRIBED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN KEATS. Dear uplands, Chester's favorable fields, My large unjealous Loves, many yet oneâ A grave good-morrow to your Graces, all, Fair tilth and fruitful seasons! Lo, how still! The midmorn empties you of men, save me; Speak to your lover, meadows! None can hear. I lie as lies yon placid Brandywine, Holding the hills and heavens in my heart For contemplation. 'Tis a perfect hour. From founts of dawn the fluent autumn day Has rippled as a brook right pleasantly Half-way to noon; but now with widening turn Makes pause, in lucent meditation locked, And rounds into a silver pool of morn, Bottom'd with clover-fields. My heart just hears Eight lingering strokes of some far village-bell, That speak the hour so inward-voiced, meseems Time's conscience has but whispered him eight hints Of revolution. Reigns that mild surcease That stills the middle of each rural mornâ When nimble noises that with sunrise ran About the farms have sunk again to rest; When Tom no more across the horse-lot calls To sleepy Dick, nor Dick husk-voiced upbraids The sway-back'd roan for stamping on his foot With sulphurous oath and kick in flank, what time The cart-chain clinks across the slanting shaft, And, kitchenward, the rattling bucket plumps Souse down the well, where quivering ducks quack loud And Susan Cook is singing. Up the sky The hesitating moon slow trembles on, Faint as a new-washed soul but lately up From out a buried body. Far about, A hundred slopes in hundred fantasies Most ravishingly run, so smooth of curve That I but seem to see the fluent plain Rise toward a rain of clover-blooms, as lakes Pout gentle mounds of plashment up to meet Big shower-drops. Now the little winds, as bees, Bowing the blooms come wandering where I lie Mixt soul and body with the clover-tufts, Light on my spirit, give from wing and thigh Rich pollens and divine sweet irritants To every nerve, and freshly make report Of inmost Nature's secret autumn-thought Unto some soul of sense within my frame That owns each cognizance of the outlying five, And sees, hears, tastes, smells, touches, all in one. Tell me, dear Clover (since my soul is thine, Since I am fain give study all the day, To make thy ways my ways, thy service mine, To seek me out thy God, my God to be, And die from out myself to live in thee)â Now, Cousin Clover, tell me in mine ear: Go'st thou to market with thy pink and green? Of what avail, this color and this grace? Wert thou but squat of stem and brindle-brown, Still careless herds would feed. A poet, thou: What worth, what worth, the whole of all thine art? Three-Leaves, instruct me! I am sick of price. Framed in the arching of two clover-stems Where-through I gaze from off my hill, afar, The spacious fields from me to Heaven take on Tremors of change and new significance To th' eye, as to the ear a simple tale Begins to hint a parable's sense beneath. The prospect widens, cuts all bounds of blue Where horizontal limits bend, and spreads Into a curious-hill'd and curious-valley'd Vast, Endless before, behind, around; which seems Th' incalculable Up-and-Down of Time Made plain before mine eyes. The clover-stems Still cover all the space; but now they bear, For clover-blooms, fair, stately heads of men With poets' faces heartsome, dear and paleâ Sweet visages of all the souls of time Whose loving service to the world has been In the artist's way expressed and bodied. Oh, In arms' reach, here be Dante, Keats, Chopin, Raphael, Lucretius, Omar, Angelo, Beethoven, Chaucer, Schubert, Shakespeare, Bach, And Buddha (sweetest masters! Let me lay These arms this once, this humble once, about Your reverend necksâthe most containing clasp, For all in all, this world e'er saw!) and there, Yet further on, bright throngs unnamable Of workers worshipful, nobilities In the Court of Gentle Service, silent men, Dwellers in woods, brooders on helpful art, And all the press of them, the fair, the large, That wrought with beauty. Lo, what bulk is here? Now comes the Course-of-things, shaped like an Ox, Slow browsing, o'er my hillside, ponderouslyâ The huge-brawned, tame, and workful Course-of-things, That hath his grass, if earth be round or flat, And hath his grass, if empires plunge in pain Or faiths flash out. This cool, unasking Ox Comes browsing o'er my hills and vales of Time, And thrusts me out his tongue, and curls it, sharp, And sicklewise, about my poets' heads, And twists them in, allâDante, Keats, Chopin, Raphael, Lucretius, Omar, Angelo, Beethoven, Chaucer, Schubert, Shakespeare, Bach, And Buddha, in one sheafâand champs and chews, With slantly-churning jaws, and swallows down; Then slowly plants a mighty forefoot out, And makes advance to futureward, one inch. So: they have played their part. And to this end? This, God? This, troublous-breeding Earth? This, Sun Of hot, quick pains? To this no-end that ends, These Masters wrought, and wept, and sweated blood, And burned, and loved, and ached with public shame, And found no friends to breathe their loves to, save Woods and wet pillows? This was all? This Ox? âNay,â quoth a sum of voices in mine ear, âGod's clover, we, and feed His Course-of-things; The pasture is God's pasture; systems strange Of food and fiberment He hath, whereby The general brawn is built for plans of His To quality precise. Kinsman, learn this: The artist's market is the heart of man; The artist's price, some little good of man. Tease not thy vision with vain search for ends. The End of Means is art that works by love. The End of Ends . . . in God's Beginning's lost.â West Chester, Pa., Summer of 1876. THE WAVING OF THE CORN. Ploughman, whose gnarly hand yet kindly wheeled Thy plough to ring this solitary tree With clover, whose round plat, reserved a-field, In cool green radius twice my length may beâ Scanting the corn thy furrows else might yield, To pleasure August, bees, fair thoughts, and me, That here come oft togetherâdaily I, Stretched prone in summer's mortal ecstasy, Do stir with thanks to thee, as stirs this morn With waving of the corn. Unseen, the farmer's boy from round the hill Whistles a snatch that seeks his soul unsought, And fills some time with tune, howbeit shrill; The cricket tells straight on his simple thoughtâ Nay, 'tis the cricket's way of being still; The peddler bee drones in, and gossips naught; Far down the wood, a one-desiring dove Times me the beating of the heart of love: And these be all the sounds that mix, each morn, With waving of the corn. From here to where the louder passions dwell, Green leagues of hilly separation roll: Trade ends where yon far clover ridges swell. Ye terrible Towns, ne'er claim the trembling soul That, craftless all to buy or hoard or sell, From out your deadly complex quarrel stole To company with large amiable trees, Suck honey summer with unjealous bees, And take Time's strokes as softly as this morn Takes waving of the corn. West Chester, Pa., 1876. SONG OF THE CHATTAHOOCHEE. Out of the hills of Habersham, Down the valleys of Hall, I hurry amain to reach the plain Run the rapid and leap the fall, Split at the rock and together again, Accept my bed, or narrow or wide, And flee from folly on every side With a lover's pain to attain the plain Far from the hills of Habersham, Far from the valleys of Hall. All down the hills of Habersham, All through the valleys of Hall, The rushes cried Abide, abide, The willful waterweeds held me thrall, The laving laurel turned my tide, The ferns and the fondling grass said Stay, The dewberry dipped for to work delay, And the little reeds sighed Abide, abide, Here in the hills of Habersham, Here in the valleys of Hall. High o'er the hills of Habersham, Veiling the valleys of Hall, The hickory told me manifold Fair tales of shade, the poplar tall Wrought me her shadowy self to hold, The chestnut, the oak, the walnut, the pine, Overleaning, with flickering meaning and sign, Said, Pass not, so cold, these manifold Deep shades of the hills of Habersham, These glades in the valleys of Hall. And oft in the hills of Habersham, And oft in the valleys of Hall, The white quartz shone, and the smooth brook-stone Did bar me of passage with friendly brawl, And many a luminous jewel lone âCrystals clear or a-cloud with mist, Ruby, garnet and amethystâ Made lures with the lights of streaming stone In the clefts of the hills of Habersham, In the beds of the valleys of Hall. But oh, not the hills of Habersham, And oh, not the valleys of Hall Avail: I am fain for to water the plain. Downward the voices of Duty callâ Downward, to toil and be mixed with the main, The dry fields burn, and the mills are to turn, And a myriad flowers mortally yearn, And the lordly main from beyond the plain Calls o'er the hills of Habersham, Calls through the valleys of Hall. 1877. FROM THE FLATS. What heartacheâne'er a hill! Inexorable, vapid, vague and chill The drear sand-levels drain my spirit low. With one poor word they tell me all they know; Whereat their stupid tongues, to tease my pain, Do drawl it o'er again and o'er again. They hurt my heart with griefs I cannot name: Always the same, the same. Nature hath no surprise, No ambuscade of beauty 'gainst mine eyes From brake or lurking dell or deep defile; No humors, frolic formsâthis mile, that mile; No rich reserves or happy-valley hopes Beyond the bend of roads, the distant slopes. Her fancy fails, her wild is all run tame: Ever the same, the same. Oh might I through these tears But glimpse some hill my Georgia high uprears, Where white the quartz and pink the pebble shine, The hickory heavenward strives, the muscadine Swings o'er the slope, the oak's far-falling shade Darkens the dogwood in the bottom glade, And down the hollow from a ferny nook Lull sings a little brook! Tampa, Florida, 1877. THE MOCKING BIRD. Superb and sole, upon a plumÃ©d spray That o'er the general leafage boldly grew, He summ'd the woods in song; or typic drew The watch of hungry hawks, the lone dismay Of languid doves when long their lovers stray, And all birds' passion-plays that sprinkle dew At morn in brake or bosky avenue. Whate'er birds did or dreamed, this bird could say. Then down he shot, bounced airily along The sward, twitched in a grasshopper, made song Midflight, perched, prinked, and to his art again. Sweet Science, this large riddle read me plain: How may the death of that dull insect be The life of yon trim Shakspere on the tree? TAMPA ROBINS. The robin laughed in the orange-tree: âHo, windy, North, a fig for thee: While breasts are red and wings are bold And green trees wave us globes of gold, Time's scythe shall reap but bliss for me âSunlight, song, and the orange-tree. Burn, golden globes in leafy sky, My orange-planets: crimson I Will shine and shoot among the spheres (Blithe meteor that no mortal fears) And thrid the heavenly orange-tree With orbits bright of minstrelsy. If that I hate wild winter's spiteâ The gibbet trees, the world in white, The sky but gray wind over a graveâ Why should I ache, the season's slave? I'll sing from the top of the orange-tree Gramercy, winter's tyranny. I'll south with the sun, and keep my clime; My wing is king of the summer-time; My breast to the sun his torch shall hold; And I'll call down through the green and gold Time, take thy scythe, reap bliss for me, Bestir thee under the orange-tree.â Tampa, Florida, 1877. THE CRYSTAL. At midnight, death's and truth's unlocking time, When far within the spirit's hearing rolls The great soft rumble of the course of thingsâ A bulk of silence in a mask of sound,â When darkness clears our vision that by day Is sun-blind, and the soul 's a ravening owl For truth and flitteth here and there about Low-lying woody tracts of time and oft Is minded for to sit upon a bough, Dry-dead and sharp, of some long-stricken tree And muse in that gaunt place,â'twas then my heart, Deep in the meditative dark, cried out: âYe companies of governor-spirits grave, Bards, and old bringers-down of flaming news From steep-wall'd heavens, holy malcontents, Sweet seers, and stellar visionaries, all That brood about the skies of poesy, Full bright ye shine, insuperable stars; Yet, if a man look hard upon you, none With total lustre blazeth, no, not one But hath some heinous freckle of the flesh Upon his shining cheek, not one but winks His ray, opaqued with intermittent mist Of defect; yea, you masters all must ask Some sweet forgiveness, which we leap to give, We lovers of you, heavenly-glad to meet Your largesse so with love, and interplight Your geniuses with our mortalities. Thus unto thee, O sweetest Shakspere sole, A hundred hurts a day I do forgive ('Tis little, but, enchantment! 'tis for thee): Small curious quibble; Juliet's prurient pun In the poor, pale face of Romeo's fancied death; Cold rant of Richard; Henry's fustian roar Which frights away that sleep he invocates; Wronged Valentine's unnatural haste to yield; Too-silly shifts of maids that mask as men In faint disguises that could ne'er disguiseâ Viola, Julia, Portia, Rosalind; Fatigues most drear, and needless overtax Of speech obscure that had as lief be plain; Last I forgive (with more delight, because 'Tis more to do) the labored-lewd discourse That e'en thy young invention's youngest heir Besmirched the world with. Father Homer, thee, Thee also I forgive thy sandy wastes Of prose and catalogue, thy drear harangues That tease the patience of the centuries, Thy sleazy scrap of story,âbut a rogue's Rape of a light-o'-love,âtoo soiled a patch To broider with the gods. Thee, Socrates, Thou dear and very strong one, I forgive Thy year-worn cloak, thine iron stringencies That were but dandy upside-down, thy words Of truth that, mildlier spoke, had mainlier wrought. So, Buddha, beautiful! I pardon thee That all the All thou hadst for needy man Was Nothing, and thy Best of being was But not to be. Worn Dante, I forgive The implacable hates that in thy horrid hells Or burn or freeze thy fellows, never loosed By death, nor time, nor love. And I forgive Thee, Milton, those thy comic-dreadful wars Where, armed with gross and inconclusive steel, Immortals smite immortals mortalwise And fill all heaven with folly. Also thee, Brave Ãschylus, thee I forgive, for that Thine eye, by bare bright justice basilisked, Turned not, nor ever learned to look where Love Stands shining. So, unto thee, Lucretius mine (For oh, what heart hath loved thee like to this That's now complaining?), freely I forgive Thy logic poor, thine error rich, thine earth Whose graves eat souls and all. Yea, all you hearts Of beauty, and sweet righteous lovers large: Aurelius fine, oft superfine; mild Saint A Kempis, overmild; Epictetus, Whiles low in thought, still with old slavery tinct; Rapt Behmen, rapt too far; high Swedenborg, O'ertoppling; Langley, that with but a touch Of art hadst sung Piers Plowman to the top Of English songs, whereof 'tis dearest, now, And most adorable; CÃ¦dmon, in the morn A-calling angels with the cow-herd's call That late brought up the cattle; Emerson, Most wise, that yet, in finding Wisdom, lost Thy Self, sometimes; tense Keats, with angels' nerves Where men's were better; Tennyson, largest voice Since Milton, yet some register of wit Wanting;âall, all, I pardon, ere 'tis asked, Your more or less, your little mole that marks You brother and your kinship seals to man. But Thee, but Thee, O sovereign Seer of time, But Thee, O poets' Poet, Wisdom's Tongue, But Thee, O man's best Man, O love's best Love, O perfect life in perfect labor writ, O all men's Comrade, Servant, King, or Priest,â What if or yet, what mole, what flaw, what lapse, What least defect or shadow of defect, What rumor, tattled by an enemy, Of inference loose, what lack of grace Even in torture's grasp, or sleep's, or death's,â Oh, what amiss may I forgive in Thee, Jesus, good Paragon, thou Crystal Christ?â Baltimore, 1880. THE REVENGE OF HAMISH. It was three slim does and a ten-tined buck in the bracken lay; And all of a sudden the sinister smell of a man, Awaft on a wind-shift, wavered and ran Down the hill-side and sifted along through the bracken and passed that way. Then Nan got a-tremble at nostril; she was the daintiest doe; In the print of her velvet flank on the velvet fern She reared, and rounded her ears in turn. Then the buck leapt up, and his head as a king's to a crown did go Full high in the breeze, and he stood as if Death had the form of a deer; And the two slim does long lazily stretching arose, For their day-dream slowlier came to a close, Till they woke and were still, breath-bound with waiting and wonder and fear. Then Alan the huntsman sprang over the hillock, the hounds shot by, The does and the ten-tined buck made a marvellous bound, The hounds swept after with never a sound, But Alan loud winded his horn in sign that the quarry was nigh. For at dawn of that day proud Maclean of Lochbuy to the hunt had waxed wild, And he cursed at old Alan till Alan fared off with the hounds For to drive him the deer to the lower glen-grounds: âI will kill a red deer,â quoth Maclean, âin the sight of the wife and the child.â So gayly he paced with the wife and the child to his chosen stand; But he hurried tall Hamish the henchman ahead: âGo turn,ââ Cried Macleanââif the deer seek to cross to the burn, Do thou turn them to me: nor fail, lest thy back be red as thy hand.â Now hard-fortuned Hamish, half blown of his breath with the height of the hill, Was white in the face when the ten-tined buck and the does Drew leaping to burn-ward; huskily rose His shouts, and his nether lip twitched, and his legs were o'er-weak for his will. So the deer darted lightly by Hamish and bounded away to the burn. But Maclean never bating his watch tarried waiting below Still Hamish hung heavy with fear for to go All the space of an hour; then he went, and his face was greenish and stern, And his eye sat back in the socket, and shrunken the eye-balls shone, As withdrawn from a vision of deeds it were shame to see. âNow, now, grim henchman, what is't with thee?â Brake Maclean, and his wrath rose red as a beacon the wind hath upblown. âThree does and a ten-tined buck made out,â spoke Hamish, full mild, âAnd I ran for to turn, but my breath it was blown, and they passed; I was weak, for ye called ere I broke me my fast.â Cried Maclean: âNow a ten-tined buck in the sight of the wife and the child I had killed if the gluttonous kern had not wrought me a snail's own wrong!â Then he sounded, and down came kinsmen and clansmen all: âTen blows, for ten tine, on his back let fall, And reckon no stroke if the blood follow not at the bite of thong!â So Hamish made bare, and took him his strokes; at the last he smiled. âNow I'll to the burn,â quoth Maclean, âfor it still may be, If a slimmer-paunched henchman will hurry with me, I shall kill me the ten-tined buck for a gift to the wife and the child!â Then the clansmen departed, by this path and that; and over the hill Sped Maclean with an outward wrath for an inward shame; And that place of the lashing full quiet became; And the wife and the child stood sad; and bloody-backed Hamish sat still. But look! red Hamish has risen; quick about and about turns he. âThere is none betwixt me and the crag-top!â he screams under breath. Then, livid as Lazarus lately from death, He snatches the child from the mother, and clambers the crag toward the sea. Now the mother drops breath; she is dumb, and her heart goes dead for a space, Till the motherhood, mistress of death, shrieks, shrieks through the glen, And that place of the lashing is live with men, And Maclean, and the gillie that told him, dash up in a desperate race. Not a breath's time for asking; an eye-glance reveals all the tale untold. They follow mad Hamish afar up the crag toward the sea, And the lady cries: âClansmen, run for a fee!â Yon castle and lands to the two first hands that shall hook him and hold Fast Hamish back from the brink!ââand ever she flies up the steep, And the clansmen pant, and they sweat, and they jostle and strain. But, mother, 'tis vain; but, father, 'tis vain; Stern Hamish stands bold on the brink, and dangles the child o'er the deep. Now a faintness falls on the men that run, and they all stand still. And the wife prays Hamish as if he were God, on her knees, Crying: âHamish! O Hamish! but please, but please For to spare him!â and Hamish still dangles the child, with a wavering will. On a sudden he turns; with a sea-hawk scream, and a gibe, and a song, Cries: âSo; I will spare ye the child if, in sight of ye all, Ten blows on Maclean's bare back shall fall, And ye reckon no stroke if the blood follow not at the bite of the thong!â Then Maclean he set hardly his tooth to his lip that his tooth was red, Breathed short for a space, said: âNay, but it never shall be! Let me hurl off the damnable hound in the sea!â But the wife: âCan Hamish go fish us the child from the sea, if dead? Say yea!âLet them lash me, Hamish?âââNay!âââHusband, the lashing will heal; But, oh, who will heal me the bonny sweet bairn in his grave? Could ye cure me my heart with the death of a knave? Quick! Love! I will bare theeâsoâkneel!â Then Maclean 'gan slowly to kneel With never a word, till presently downward he jerked to the earth. Then the henchmanâhe that smote Hamishâwould tremble and lag; âStrike, hard!â quoth Hamish, full stern, from the crag; Then he struck him, and âOne!â sang Hamish, and danced with the child in his mirth. And no man spake beside Hamish; he counted each stroke with a song. When the last stroke fell, then he moved him a pace down the height, And he held forth the child in the heartaching sight Of the mother, and looked all pitiful grave, as repenting a wrong. And there as the motherly arms stretched out with the thanksgiving prayerâ And there as the mother crept up with a fearful swift pace, Till her finger nigh felt of the bairnie's faceâ In a flash fierce Hamish turned round and lifted the child in the air, And sprang with the child in his arms from the horrible height in the sea, Shrill screeching, âRevenge!â in the wind-rush; and pallid Maclean, Age-feeble with anger and impotent pain, Crawled up on the crag, and lay flat, and locked hold of dead roots of a treeâ And gazed hungrily o'er, and the blood from his back drip-dripped in the brine; And a sea-hawk flung down a skeleton fish as he flew, And the mother stared white on the waste of blue, And the wind drove a cloud to seaward, and the sun began to shine. Baltimore, 1878. TO BAYARD TAYLOR. To range, deep-wrapt, along a heavenly height, O'erseeing all that man but undersees; To loiter down lone alleys of delight, And hear the beating of the hearts of trees, And think the thoughts that lilies speak in white By greenwood pools and pleasant passages; With healthy dreams a-dream in flesh and soul, To pace, in mighty meditations drawn, From out the forest to the open knoll Where much thyme is, whence blissful leagues of law Betwixt the fringing woods to southward roll By tender inclinations; mad with dawn, Ablaze with fires that flame in silver dew When each small globe doth glass the morning-star, Long ere the sun, sweet-smitten through and through With dappled revelations read afar, Suffused with saintly ecstasies of blue As all the holy eastern heavens are,â To fare thus fervid to what daily toil Employs thy spirit in that larger Land Where thou art gone; to strive, but not to moil In nothings that do mar the artist's hand, Not drudge unriched, as grain rots back to soil,â No profit out of death,âgoing, yet still at stand,â Giving what life is here in hand to-day For that that 's in to-morrow's bush, perchance,â Of this year's harvest none in the barn to lay, All sowed for next year's crop,âa dull advance In curves that come but by another way Back to the start,âa thriftless thrift of ants Whose winter wastes their summer; O my Friend, Freely to range, to muse, to toil, is thine: Thine, now, to watch with Homer sails that bend Unstained by Helen's beauty o'er the brine Tow'rds some clean Troy no Hector need defend Nor flame devour; or, in some mild moon's shine, Where amiabler winds the whistle heed, To sail with Shelley o'er a bluer sea, And mark Prometheus, from his fetters freed, Pass with Deucalion over Italy, While bursts the flame from out his eager reed Wild-stretching towards the West of destiny; Or, prone with Plato, Shakspere and a throng Of bards beneath some plane-tree's cool eclipse To gaze on glowing meads where, lingering long, Psyche's large Butterfly her honey sips; Or, mingling free in choirs of German song, To learn of Goethe's life from Goethe's lips; These, these are thine, and we, who still are dead, Do yearnânay, not to kill thee back again Into this charnel life, this lowlihead, Not to the dark of sense, the blinking brain, The hugged delusion drear, the hunger fed On husks of guess, the monarchy of pain, The cross of love, the wrench of faith, the shame Of science that cannot prove proof is, the twist Of blame for praise and bitter praise for blame, The silly stake and tether round the wrist By fashion fixed, the virtue that doth claim The gains of vice, the lofty mark that's missed By all the mortal space 'twixt heaven and hell, The soul's sad growth o'er stationary friends Who hear us from our height not well, not well, The slant of accident, the sudden bends Of purpose tempered strong, the gambler's spell, The son's disgrace, the plan that e'er depends On others' plots, the tricks that passion plays (I loving you, you him, he none at all), The artist's painâto walk his blood-stained ways, A special soul, yet judged as generalâ The endless grief of art, the sneer that slays, The war, the wound, the groan, the funeral pallâ Not into these, bright spirit, do we yearn To bring thee back, but oh, to be, to be Unbound of all these gyves, to stretch, to spurn The dark from off our dolorous lids, to see Our spark, Conjecture, blaze and sunwise burn, And suddenly to stand again by thee! Ah, not for us, not yet, by thee to stand: For us, the fret, the dark, the thorn, the chill, For us, to call across unto thy Land, âFriend, get thee to the ministrels' holy hill, And kiss those brethren for us, mouth and hand, And make our duty to our master Will.â Baltimore, 1879. A DEDICATION. TO CHARLOTTE CUSHMAN. As Love will carve dear names upon a tree, Symbol of gravure on his heart to be, So thought I thine with loving text to set In the growth and substance of my canzonet; But, writing it, my tears begin to fallâ This wild-rose stem for thy large name 's too small! Nay, still my trembling hands are fain, are fain Cut the good letters though they lap again; Perchance such folk as mark the blur and stain Will say, It was the beating of the rain; Or, haply these o'er-woundings of the stem May loose some little balm, to plead for them. 1876. TO CHARLOTTE CUSHMAN. Look where a three-point star shall weave his beam Into the slumb'rous tissue of some stream, Till his bright self o'er his bright copy seem Fulfillment dropping on a come-true dream; So in this night of art thy soul doth show Her excellent double in the steadfast flow Of wishing love that through men's hearts doth go: At once thou shin'st above and shin'st below. E'en when thou strivest there within Art's sky (Each star must o'er a strenuous orbit fly), Full calm thine image in our love doth lie, A Motion glassed in a Tranquillity. So triple-rayed, thou mov'st, yet stay'st, sereneâ Art's artist, Love's dear woman, Fame's good queen! Baltimore, 1875. THE STIRRUP-CUP. Death, thou 'rt a cordial old and rare: Look how compounded, with what care! Time got his wrinkles reaping thee Sweet herbs from all antiquity. David to thy distillage went, Keats, and Gotama excellent, Omar Khayyam, and Chaucer bright, And Shakspere for a king-delight. Then, Time, let not a drop be spilt: Hand me the cup whene'er thou wilt; 'Tis thy rich stirrup-cup to me; I'll drink it down right smilingly. Tampa, Florida, 1877. A SONG OF ETERNITY IN TIME. Once, at night, in the manor wood My Love and I long silent stood, Amazed that any heavens could Decree to part us, bitterly repining. My Love, in aimless love and grief, Reached forth and drew aside a leaf That just above us played the thief And stole our starlight that for us was shining. A star that had remarked her pain Shone straightway down that leafy lane, And wrought his image, mirror-plain, Within a tear that on her lash hung gleaming. âThus Time,â I cried, âis but a tear Some one hath wept 'twixt hope and fear, Yet in his little lucent sphere Our star of stars, Eternity, is beaming.â Macon, Georgia, 1867. Revised in 1879. OWL AGAINST ROBIN. Frowning, the owl in the oak complained him Sore, that the song of the robin restrained him Wrongly of slumber, rudely of rest. âFrom the north, from the east, from the south and the west Woodland, wheat-field, corn-field, clover, Over and over and over and over, Five o'clock, ten o'clock, twelve, or seven, Nothing but robin-songs heard under heaven: How can we sleep? Peep! you whistle, and cheep! cheep! cheep! Oh, peep, if you will, and buy, if 'tis cheap, And have done; for an owl must sleep. Are ye singing for fame, and who shall be first? Each day 's the same, yet the last is worst, And the summer is cursed with the silly outburst Of idiot red-breasts peeping and cheeping By day, when all honest birds ought to be sleeping. Lord, what a din! And so out of all reason. Have ye not heard that each thing hath its season? Night is to work in, night is for play-time; Good heavens, not day-time! A vulgar flaunt is the flaring day, The impudent, hot, unsparing day, That leaves not a stain nor a secret untold,â Day the reporter,âthe gossip of old,â Deformity's tease,âman's common scoldâ Poh! Shut the eyes, let the sense go numb When day down the eastern way has come. 'Tis clear as the moon (by the argument drawn From Design) that the world should retire at dawn. Day kills. The leaf and the laborer breathe Death in the sun, the cities seethe, The mortal black marshes bubble with heat And puff up pestilence; nothing is sweet Has to do with the sun: even virtue will taint (Philosophers say) and manhood grow faint In the lands where the villainous sun has sway Through the livelong drag of the dreadful day. What Eden but noon-light stares it tame, Shadowless, brazen, forsaken of shame? For the sun tells lies on the landscape,ânow Reports me the what, unrelieved with the how,â As messengers lie, with the facts alone, Delivering the word and withholding the tone. But oh, the sweetness, and oh, the light Of the high-fastidious night! Oh, to awake with the wise old starsâ The cultured, the careful, the Chesterfield stars, That wink at the work-a-day fact of crime And shine so rich through the ruins of time That Baalbec is finer than London; oh, To sit on the bough that zigzags low By the woodland pool, And loudly laugh at man, the fool That vows to the vulgar sun; oh, rare, To wheel from the wood to the window where A day-worn sleeper is dreaming of care, And perch on the sill and straightly stare Through his visions; rare, to sail Aslant with the hill and a-curve with the vale,â To flit down the shadow-shot-with-gleam, Betwixt hanging leaves and starlit stream, Hither, thither, to and fro, Silent, aimless, dayless, slow (Aimless? Field-mice? True, they 're slain, But the night-philosophy hoots at pain, Grips, eats quick, and drops the bones In the water beneath the bough, nor moans At the death life feeds on). Robin, pray Come away, come away To the cultus of night. Abandon the day. Have more to think and have less to say. And cannot you walk now? Bah! don't hop! Stop! Look at the owl, scarce seen, scarce heard, O irritant, iterant, maddening bird!â Baltimore, 1880. A SONG OF THE FUTURE. Sail fast, sail fast, Ark of my hopes, Ark of my dreams; Sweep lordly o'er the drownÃ¨d Past, Fly glittering through the sun's strange beams; Sail fast, sail fast. Breaths of new buds from off some drying lea With news about the Future scent the sea: My brain is beating like the heart of Haste; I'll loose me a bird upon this Present waste; Go, trembling song, And stay not long; oh, stay not long: Thou 'rt only a gray and sober dove, But thine eye is faith and thy wing is love. Baltimore, 1878. OPPOSITION. Of fret, of dark, of thorn, of chill, Complain no more; for these, O heart, Direct the random of the will As rhymes direct the rage of art. The lute's fixt fret, that runs athwart The strain and purpose of the string, For governance and nice consort Doth bar his wilful wavering. The dark hath many dear avails; The dark distils divinest dews; The dark is rich with nightingales, With dreams, and with the heavenly Muse. Bleeding with thorns of petty strife, I'll ease (as lovers do) my smart With sonnets to my lady Life Writ red in issues from the heart. What grace may lie within the chill Of favor frozen fast in scorn! When Good's a-freeze, we call it Ill! This rosy Time is glacier-born. Of fret, of dark, of thorn, of chill, Complain thou not, O heart; for these Bank-in the current of the will To uses, arts, and charities. Baltimore, 1879â80. ROSE-MORALS. I.âRED. Would that my songs might be What roses make by day and nightâ Distillments of my clod of misery Into delight. Soul, could'st thou bare thy breast As yon red rose, and dare the day, All clean, and large, and calm with velvet rest? Say yeaâsay yea! Ah, dear my Rose, good-bye; The wind is up; so; drift away. That songs from me as leaves from thee may fly, I strive, I pray. II.âWHITE. Soul, get thee to the heart Of yonder tuberose: hide thee thereâ There breathe the meditations of thine art Suffused with prayer. Of spirit grave yet light, How fervent fragrances uprise Pure-born from these most rich and yet most white Virginities! Mulched with unsavory death, Grow, Soul! unto such white estate, That virginal-prayerful art shall be thy breath, Thy work, thy fate. Baltimore, 1875. CORN. To-day the woods are trembling through and through With shimmering forms, that flash before my view, Then melt in green as dawn-stars melt in blue. The leaves that wave against my cheek caress Like women's hands; the embracing boughs express A subtlety of mighty tenderness; The copse-depths into little noises start, That sound anon like beatings of a heart, Anon like talk 'twixt lips not far apart. The beech dreams balm, as a dreamer hums a song; Through that vague wafture, expirations strong Throb from young hickories breathing deep and long With stress and urgence bold of prisoned spring And ecstasy of burgeoning. Now, since the dew-plashed road of morn is dry, Forth venture odors of more quality And heavenlier giving. Like Jove's locks awry, Long muscadines Rich-wreathe the spacious foreheads of great pines, And breathe ambrosial passion from their vines. I pray with mosses, ferns and flowers shy That hide like gentle nuns from human eye To lift adoring perfumes to the sky. I hear faint bridal-sighs of brown and green Dying to silent hints of kisses keen As far lights fringe into a pleasant sheen. I start at fragmentary whispers, blown From undertalks of leafy souls unknown, Vague purports sweet, of inarticulate tone. Dreaming of gods, men, nuns and brides, between Old companies of oaks that inward lean To join their radiant amplitudes of green I slowly move, with ranging looks that pass Up from the matted miracles of grass Into yon veined complex of space Where sky and leafage interlace So close, the heaven of blue is seen Inwoven with a heaven of green. I wander to the zigzag-cornered fence Where sassafras, intrenched in brambles dense, Contests with stolid vehemence The march of culture, setting limb and thorn As pikes against the army of the corn. There, while I pause, my fieldward-faring eyes Take harvests, where the stately corn-ranks rise, Of inward dignities And large benignities and insights wise, Graces and modest majesties. Thus, without theft, I reap another's field; Thus, without tilth, I house a wondrous yield, And heap my heart with quintuple crops concealed. Look, out of line one tall corn-captain stands Advanced beyond the foremost of his bands, And waves his blades upon the very edge And hottest thicket of the battling hedge. Thou lustrous stalk, that ne'er mayst walk nor talk, Still shalt thou type the poet-soul sublime That leads the vanward of his timid time And sings up cowards with commanding rhymeâ Soul calm, like thee, yet fain, like thee, to grow By double increment, above, below; Soul homely, as thou art, yet rich in grace like thee, Teaching the yeomen selfless chivalry That moves in gentle curves of courtesy; Soul filled like thy long veins with sweetness tense, By every godlike sense Transmuted from the four wild elements. Drawn to high plans, Thou lift'st more stature than a mortal man's, Yet ever piercest downward in the mould And keepest hold Upon the reverend and steadfast earth That gave thee birth; Yea, standest smiling in thy future grave, Serene and brave, With unremitting breath Inhaling life from death, Thine epitaph writ fair in fruitage eloquent, Thyself thy monument. As poets should, Thou hast built up thy hardihood With universal food, Drawn in select proportion fair From honest mould and vagabond air; From darkness of the dreadful night, And joyful light; From antique ashes, whose departed flame In thee has finer life and longer fame; From wounds and balms, From storms and calms, From potsherds and dry bones And ruin-stones. Into thy vigorous substance thou hast wrought Whate'er the hand of Circumstance hath brought; Yea, into cool solacing green hast spun White radiance hot from out the sun. So thou dost mutually leaven Strength of earth with grace of heaven; So thou dost marry new and old Into a one of higher mould; So thou dost reconcile the hot and cold, The dark and bright, And many a heart-perplexing opposite, And so, Akin by blood to high and low, Fitly thou playest out thy poet's part, Richly expending thy much-bruisÃ©d heart In equal care to nourish lord in hall Or beast in stall: Thou took'st from all that thou mightst give to all O steadfast dweller on the selfsame spot Where thou wast born, that still repinest notâ Type of the home-fond heart, the happy lot!â Deeply thy mild content rebukes the land Whose flimsy homes, built on the shifting sand Of trade, for ever rise and fall With alternation whimsical, Enduring scarce a day, Then swept away By swift engulfments of incalculable tides Whereon capricious Commerce rides. Look, thou substantial spirit of content! Across this little vale, thy continent, To where, beyond the mouldering mill, Yon old deserted Georgian hill Bares to the sun his piteous aged crest And seamy breast, By restless-hearted children left to lie Untended there beneath the heedless sky, As barbarous folk expose their old to die. Upon that generous-rounding side, With gullies scarified Where keen Neglect his lash hath plied, Dwelt one I knew of old, who played at toil, And gave to coquette Cotton soul and soil. Scorning the slow reward of patient grain, He sowed his heart with hopes of swifter gain, Then sat him down and waited for the rain. He sailed in borrowed ships of usuryâ A foolish Jason on a treacherous sea, Seeking the Fleece and finding misery. Lulled by smooth-rippling loans, in idle trance He lay, content that unthrift Circumstance Should plough for him the stony field of Chance. Yea, gathering crops whose worth no man might tell, He staked his life on games of Buy-and-Sell, And turned each field into a gambler's hell. Aye, as each year began, My farmer to the neighboring city ran; Passed with a mournful anxious face Into the banker's inner place; Parleyed, excused, pleaded for longer grace; Railed at the drought, the worm, the rust, the grass; Protested ne'er again 'twould come to pass; With many an oh and if and but alas Parried or swallowed searching questions rude, And kissed the dust to soften Dives's mood. At last, small loans by pledges great renewed, He issues smiling from the fatal door, And buys with lavish hand his yearly store Till his small borrowings will yield no more. Aye, as each year declined, With bitter heart and ever-brooding mind He mourned his fate unkind. In dust, in rain, with might and main, He nursed his cotton, cursed his grain, Fretted for news that made him fret again, Snatched at each telegram of Future Sale, And thrilled with Bulls' or Bears' alternate wailâ In hope or fear alike for ever pale. And thus from year to year, through hope and fear, With many a curse and many a secret tear, Striving in vain his cloud of debt to clear, At last He woke to find his foolish dreaming past, And all his best-of-life the easy prey Of squandering scamps and quacks that lined his way With vile array, From rascal statesman down to petty knave; Himself, at best, for all his bragging brave, A gamester's catspaw and a banker's slave. Then, worn and gray, and sick with deep unrest, He fled away into the oblivious West, Unmourned, unblest. Old hill! old hill! thou gashed and hairy Lear Whom the divine Cordelia of the year, E'en pitying Spring, will vainly strive to cheerâ King, that no subject man nor beast may own, Discrowned, undaughtered and aloneâ Yet shall the great God turn thy fate, And bring thee back into thy monarch state And majesty immaculate. Lo, through hot waverings of the August morn, Thou givest from thy vasty sides forlorn Visions of golden treasuries of cornâ Ripe largesse lingering for some bolder heart That manfully shall take thy part, And tend thee, And defend thee, With antique sinew and with modern art Sunnyside, Georgia, August, 1874. THE SYMPHONY. âO Trade! O Trade! would thou wert dead! The Time needs heartâ'tis tired of head: We're all for love,â the violins said. âOf what avail the rigorous tale Of bill for coin and box for bale? Grant thee, O Trade! thine uttermost hope: Level red gold with blue sky-slope, And base it deep as devils grope: When all 's done, what hast thou won Of the only sweet that's under the sun? Ay, canst thou buy a single sigh Of true love's least, least ecstasy?â Then, with a bridegroom's heart-beats trembling, All the mightier strings assembling Ranged them on the violins' side As when the bridegroom leads the bride, And, heart in voice, together cried: âYea, what avail the endless tale Of gain by cunning and plus by sale? Look up the land, look down the land The poor, the poor, the poor, they stand Wedged by the pressing of Trade's hand Against an inward-opening door That pressure tightens evermore: They sigh a monstrous foul-air sigh For the outside leagues of liberty, Where Art, sweet lark, translates the sky Into a heavenly melody. âEach day, all dayâ (these poor folks say), âIn the same old year-long, drear-long way, We weave in the mills and heave in the kilns, We sieve mine-meshes under the hills, And thieve much gold from the Devil's bank tills, To relieve, O God, what manner of ills?â The beasts, they hunger, and eat, and die; And so do we, and the world's a sty; Hush, fellow-swine: why nuzzle and cry? Swinehood hath no remedy Say many men, and hasten by, Clamping the nose and blinking the eye. But who said once, in the lordly tone, Man shall not live by bread alone But all that cometh from the Throne? Hath God said so? But Trade saith No: And the kilns and the curt-tongued mills say Go! There's plenty that can, if you can't: we know. Move out, if you think you're underpaid. The poor are prolific; we're not afraid; Trade is trade.ââ Thereat this passionate protesting Meekly changed, and softened till It sank to sad requesting And suggesting sadder still: âAnd oh, if men might some time see How piteous-false the poor decree That trade no more than trade must be! Does business mean, Die, youâlive, I? Then âTrade is tradeâ but sings a lie: 'Tis only war grown miserly. If business is battle, name it so: War-crimes less will shame it so, And widows less will blame it so. Alas, for the poor to have some part In yon sweet living lands of Art, Makes problem not for head, but heart. Vainly might Plato's brain revolve it: Plainly the heart of a child could solve it.â And then, as when from words that seem but rude We pass to silent pain that sits abrood Back in our heart's great dark and solitude, So sank the strings to gentle throbbing Of long chords change-marked with sobbingâ Motherly sobbing, not distinctlier heard Than half wing-openings of the sleeping bird, Some dream of danger to her young hath stirred. Then stirring and demurring ceased, and lo! Every least ripple of the strings' song-flow Died to a level with each level bow And made a great chord tranquil-surfaced so, As a brook beneath his curving bank doth go To linger in the sacred dark and green Where many boughs the still pool overlean And many leaves make shadow with their sheen. But presently A velvet flute-note fell down pleasantly Upon the bosom of that harmony, And sailed and sailed incessantly, As if a petal from a wild-rose blown Had fluttered down upon that pool of tone And boatwise dropped o' the convex side And floated down the glassy tide And clarified and glorified The solemn spaces where the shadows bide. From the warm concave of that fluted note Somewhat, half song, half odor, forth did float, As if a rose might somehow be a throat; âWhen Nature from her far-off glen Flutes her soft messages to men, The flute can say them o'er again; Yea, Nature, singing sweet and lone, Breathes through life's strident polyphone The flute-voice in the world of tone. Sweet friends, Man's love ascends To finer and diviner ends Than man's mere thought e'er comprehends For I, e'en I, As here I lie, A petal on a harmony, Demand of Science whence and why Man's tender pain, man's inward cry, When he doth gaze on earth and sky? I am not overbold: I hold Full powers from Nature manifold. I speak for each no-tonguÃ©d tree That, spring by spring, doth nobler be, And dumbly and most wistfully His mighty prayerful arms outspreads Above men's oft-unheeding heads, And his big blessing downward sheds. I speak for all-shaped blooms and leaves, Lichens on stones and moss on eaves, Grasses and grains in ranks and sheaves; Broad-fronded ferns and keen-leaved canes, And briery mazes bounding lanes, And marsh-plants, thirsty-cupped for rains, And milky stems and sugary veins; For every long-armed woman-vine That round a piteous tree doth twine; For passionate odors, and divine Pistils, and petals crystalline; All purities of shady springs, All shynesses of film-winged things That fly from tree-trunks and bark-rings; All modesties of mountain-fawns That leap to covert from wild lawns, And tremble if the day but dawns; All sparklings of small beady eyes Of birds, and sidelong glances wise Wherewith the jay hints tragedies; All piquancies of prickly burs, And smoothnesses of downs and furs Of eiders and of minevers; All limpid honeys that do lie At stamen-bases, nor deny The humming-birds' fine roguery, Bee-thighs, nor any butterfly; All gracious curves of slender wings, Bark-mottlings, fibre-spiralings, Fern-wavings and leaf-flickerings; Each dial-marked leaf and flower-bell Wherewith in every lonesome dell Time to himself his hours doth tell; All tree-sounds, rustlings of pine-cones, Wind-sighings, doves' melodious moans, And night's unearthly under-tones; All placid lakes and waveless deeps, All cool reposing mountain-steeps, Vale-calms and tranquil lotos-sleeps;â Yea, all fair forms, and sounds, and lights, And warmths, and mysteries, and mights, Of Nature's utmost depths and heights, âThese doth my timid tongue present, Their mouthpiece and leal instrument And servant, all love-eloquent. I heard, when âAll for loveâ the violins cried: So, Nature calls through all her system wide, Give me thy love, O man, so long denied. Much time is run, and man hath changed his ways, Since Nature, in the antique fable-days, Was hid from man's true love by proxy fays, False fauns and rascal gods that stole her praise. The nymphs, cold creatures of man's colder brain, Chilled Nature's streams till man's warm heart was fain Never to lave its love in them again. Later, a sweet Voice Love thy neighbor said; Then first the bounds of neighborhood outspread Beyond all confines of old ethnic dread. Vainly the Jew might wag his covenant head: âAll men are neighbors,â so the sweet Voice said. So, when man's arms had circled all man's race, The liberal compass of his warm embrace Stretched bigger yet in the dark bounds of space; With hands a-grope he felt smooth Nature's grace, Drew her to breast and kissed her sweetheart face: Yea man found neighbors in great hills and trees And streams and clouds and suns and birds and bees, And throbbed with neighbor-loves in loving these. But oh, the poor! the poor! the poor! That stand by the inward-opening door Trade's hand doth tighten ever more, And sigh their monstrous foul-air sigh For the outside hills of liberty, Where Nature spreads her wild blue sky For Art to make into melody! Thou Trade! thou king of the modern days! Change thy ways, Change thy ways; Let the sweaty laborers file A little while, A little while, Where Art and Nature sing and smile. Trade! is thy heart all dead, all dead? And hast thou nothing but a head? I'm all for heart,â the flute-voice said, And into sudden silence fled, Like as a blush that while 'tis red Dies to a still, still white instead. Thereto a thrilling calm succeeds, Till presently the silence breeds A little breeze among the reeds That seems to blow by sea-marsh weeds: Then from the gentle stir and fret Sings out the melting clarionet, Like as a lady sings while yet Her eyes with salty tears are wet. âO Trade! O Trade!â the Lady said, âI too will wish thee utterly dead If all thy heart is in thy head. For O my God! and O my God! What shameful ways have women trod At beckoning of Trade's golden rod! Alas when sighs are traders' lies, And heart's-ease eyes and violet eyes Are merchandise! O purchased lips that kiss with pain! O cheeks coin-spotted with smirch and stain! O trafficked hearts that break in twain! âAnd yet what wonder at my sisters' crime? So hath Trade withered up Love's sinewy prime, Men love not women as in olden time. Ah, not in these cold merchantable days Deem men their life an opal gray, where plays The one red Sweet of gracious ladies'-praise. Now, comes a suitor with sharp prying eyeâ Says, Here, you Lady, if you'll sell, I'll buy: Come, heart for heartâa trade? What! weeping? why? Shame on such wooers' dapper mercery! I would my lover kneeling at my feet In humble manliness should cry, O sweet! I know not if thy heart my heart will greet: I ask not if thy love my love can meet: Whate'er thy worshipful soft tongue shall say, I'll kiss thine answer, be it yea or nay: I do but know I love thee, and I pray To be thy knight until my dying day. Woe him that cunning trades in hearts contrives; Base love good women to base loving drives. If men loved larger, larger were our lives; And wooed they nobler, won they nobler wives.â There thrust the bold straightforward horn To battle for that lady lorn, With heartsome voice of mellow scorn, Like any knight in knighthood's morn. âNow comfort thee,â said he, âFair Lady. For God shall right thy grievous wrong, And man shall sing thee a true-love song, Voiced in act his whole life long, Yea, all thy sweet life long, Fair Lady. Where's he that craftily hath said, The day of chivalry is dead? I'll prove that lie upon his head, Or I will die instead, Fair Lady. Is Honor gone into his grave? Hath Faith become a caitiff knave, And Selfhood turned into a slave To work in Mammon's cave, Fair Lady? Will Truth's long blade ne'er gleam again? Hath Giant Trade in dungeons slain All great contempts of mean-got gain And hates of inward stain, Fair Lady? For aye shall name and fame be sold, And place be hugged for the sake of gold, And smirch-robed Justice feebly scold At Crime all money-bold, Fair Lady? Shall self-wrapt husbands aye forget Kiss-pardons for the daily fret Wherewith sweet wifely eyes are wetâ Blind to lips kiss-wise setâ Fair Lady? Shall lovers higgle, heart for heart, Till wooing grows a trading mart Where much for little, and all for part, Make love a cheapening art, Fair Lady? Shall woman scorch for a single sin That her betrayer may revel in, And she be burnt, and he but grin When that the flames begin, Fair Lady? Shall ne'er prevail the woman's plea, We maids would far, far whiter be If that our eyes might sometimes see Men maids in purity, Fair Lady? Shall Trade aye salve his conscience-aches With jibes at Chivalry's old mistakesâ The wars that o'erhot knighthood makes For Christ's and ladies' sakes, Fair Lady? Now by each knight that e'er hath prayed To fight like a man and love like a maid, Since Pembroke's life, as Pembroke's blade, I' the scabbard, death, was laid, Fair Lady, I dare avouch my faith is bright That God doth right and God hath might. Nor time hath changed His hair to white, Nor His dear love to spite, Fair Lady. I doubt no doubts: I strive, and shrive my clay, And fight my fight in the patient modern way For true love and for theeâah me! and pray To be thy knight until my dying day, Fair Lady.â Made end that knightly horn, and spurred away Into the thick of the melodious fray. And then the hautboy played and smiled, And sang like any large-eyed child, Cool-hearted and all undefiled. âHuge Trade!â he said, âWould thou wouldst lift me on thy head And run where'er my finger led! Once said a Manâand wise was Heâ Never shalt thou the heavens see, Save as a little child thou be.â Then o'er sea-lashings of commingling tunes The ancient wise bassoons, Like weird Gray-beard Old harpers sitting on the high sea-dunes, Chanted runes: âBright-waved gain, gray-waved loss, The sea of all doth lash and toss, One wave forward and one across: But now 'twas trough, now 'tis crest, And worst doth foam and flash to best, And curst to blest. Life! Life! thou sea-fugue, writ from east to west, Love, Love alone can pore On thy dissolving score Of harsh half-phrasings, Blotted ere writ, And double erasings Of chords most fit. Yea, Love, sole music-master blest, May read thy weltering palimpsest. To follow Time's dying melodies through, And never to lose the old in the new, And ever to solve the discords trueâ Love alone can do. And ever Love hears the poor-folks' crying, And ever Love hears the women's sighing, And ever sweet knighthood's death-defying, And ever wise childhood's deep implying, But never a trader's glozing and lying. And yet shall Love himself be heard, Though long deferred, though long deferred: O'er the modern waste a dove hath whirred: Music is Love in search of a word.â Baltimore, 1875. MY SPRINGS. In the heart of the Hills of Life, I know Two springs that with unbroken flow Forever pour their lucent streams Into my soul's far Lake of Dreams. Not larger than two eyes, they lie Beneath the many-changing sky And mirror all of life and time, âSerene and dainty pantomime. Shot through with lights of stars and dawns, And shadowed sweet by ferns and fawns, âThus heaven and earth together vie Their shining depths to sanctify. Always when the large Form of Love Is hid by storms that rage above, I gaze in my two springs and see Love in his very verity. Always when Faith with stifling stress Of grief hath died in bitterness, I gaze in my two springs and see A Faith that smiles immortally. Always when Charity and Hope, In darkness bounden, feebly grope, I gaze in my two springs and see A Light that sets my captives free. Always, when Art on perverse wing Flies where I cannot hear him sing, I gaze in my two springs and see A charm that brings him back to me. When Labor faints, and Glory fails, And coy Reward in sighs exhales, I gaze in my two springs and see Attainment full and heavenly. O Love, O Wife, thine eyes are they, âMy springs from out whose shining gray Issue the sweet celestial streams That feed my life's bright Lake of Dreams. Oval and large and passion-pure And gray and wise and honor-sure; Soft as a dying violet-breath Yet calmly unafraid of death; Thronged, like two dove-cotes of gray doves, With wife's and mother's and poor-folk's loves, And home-loves and high glory-loves And science-loves and story-loves, And loves for all that God and man In art and nature make or plan, And lady-loves for spidery lace And broideries and supple grace And diamonds and the whole sweet round Of littles that large life compound, And loves for God and God's bare truth, And loves for Magdalen and Ruth, Dear eyes, dear eyes and rare completeâ Being heavenly-sweet and earthly-sweet, âI marvel that God made you mine, For when He frowns, 'tis then ye shine! Baltimore, 1874. IN ABSENCE. [I. The storm that snapped our fate's one ship in twain] The storm that snapped our fate's one ship in twain Hath blown my half o' the wreck from thine apart. O Love! O Love! across the gray-waved main To thee-ward strain my eyes, my arms, my heart. I ask my God if e'en in His sweet place, Where, by one waving of a wistful wing, My soul could straightway tremble face to face With thee, with thee, across the stellar ringâ Yea, where thine absence I could ne'er bewail Longer than lasts that little blank of bliss When lips draw back, with recent pressure pale, To round and redden for another kissâ Would not my lonesome heart still sigh for thee What time the drear kiss-intervals must be? [II. So do the mottled formulas of Sense] So do the mottled formulas of Sense Glide snakewise through our dreams of Aftertime; So errors breed in reeds and grasses dense That bank our singing rivulets of rhyme. By Sense rule Space and Time; but in God's Land Their intervals are not, save such as lie Betwixt successive tones in concords bland Whose loving distance makes the harmony. Ah, there shall never come 'twixt me and thee Gross dissonances of the mile, the year; But in the multichords of ecstasy Our souls shall mingle, yet be featured clear, And absence, wrought to intervals divine, Shall part, yet link, thy nature's tone and mine. [III. Look down the shining peaks of all my days] Look down the shining peaks of all my days Base-hidden in the valleys of deep night, So shalt thou see the heights and depths of praise My love would render unto love's delight; For I would make each day an Alp sublime Of passionate snow, white-hot yet icy-clear, One crystal of the true-loves of all time Spiring the world's prismatic atmosphere; And I would make each night an awful vale Deep as thy soul, obscure as modesty, With every star in heaven trembling pale O'er sweet profounds where only Love can see. Oh, runs not thus the lesson thou hast taught?â When life's all love, 'tis life: aught else, 'tis naught. [IV. Let no man say, He at his lady's feet] Let no man say, He at his lady's feet Lays worship that to Heaven alone belongs; Yea, swings the incense that for God is meet In flippant censers of light lover's songs. Who says it, knows not God, nor love, nor thee; For love is large as is yon heavenly dome: In love's great blue, each passion is full free To fly his favorite flight and build his home. Did e'er a lark with skyward-pointing beak Stab by mischance a level-flying dove? Wife-love flies level, his dear mate to seek: God-love darts straight into the skies above. Crossing, the windage of each other's wings But speeds them both upon their journeyings. Baltimore, 1874. ACKNOWLEDGMENT. [I. O Age that half believ'st thou half believ'st] O Age that half believ'st thou half believ'st, Half doubt'st the substance of thine own half doubt, And, half perceiving that thou half perceiv'st, Stand'st at thy temple door, heart in, head out! Lo! while thy heart's within, helping the choir, Without, thine eyes range up and down the time, Blinking at o'er-bright science, smit with desire To see and not to see. Hence, crime on crime. Yea, if the Christ (called thine) now paced yon street, Thy halfness hot with His rebuke would swell; Legions of scribes would rise and run and beat His fair intolerable Wholeness twice to hell. Nay (so, dear Heart, thou whisperest in my soul), 'T is a half time, yet Time will make it whole. [II. Now at thy soft recalling voice I rise] Now at thy soft recalling voice I rise Where thought is lord o'er Time's complete estate, Like as a dove from out the gray sedge flies To tree-tops green where cooes his heavenly mate. From these clear coverts high and cool I see How every time with every time is knit, And each to all is mortised cunningly, And none is sole or whole, yet all are fit. Thus, if this Age but as a comma show 'Twixt weightier clauses of large-worded years, My calmer soul scorns not the mark: I know This crooked point Time's complex sentence clears. Yet more I learn while, Friend! I sit by thee: Who sees all time, sees all eternity. [III. If I do ask, How God can dumbness keep] If I do ask, How God can dumbness keep While Sin creeps grinning through His house of Time, Stabbing His saintliest children in their sleep, And staining holy walls with clots of crime?â Or, How may He whose wish but names a fact Refuse what miser's-scanting of supply Would richly glut each void where man hath lacked Of grace or bread?âor, How may Power deny Wholeness to th' almost-folk that hurt our hopeâ These heart-break Hamlets who so barely fail In life or art that but a hair's more scope Had set them fair on heights they ne'er may scale?â Somehow by thee, dear Love, I win content: Thy Perfect stops th' Imperfect's argument. [IV. By the more height of thy sweet stature grown] By the more height of thy sweet stature grown, Twice-eyed with thy gray vision set in mine, I ken far lands to wifeless men unknown, I compass stars for one-sexed eyes too fine. No text on sea-horizons cloudily writ, No maxim vaguely starred in fields or skies, But this wise thou-in-me deciphers it: Oh, thou 'rt the Height of heights, the Eye of eyes. Not hardest Fortune's most unbounded stress Can blind my soul nor hurl it from on high, Possessing thee, the self of loftiness, And very light that Light discovers by. Howe'er thou turn'st, wrong Earth! still Love 's in sight: For we are taller than the breadth of night. Baltimore, 1874â5. LAUS MARIÃ. Across the brook of Time man leaping goes On stepping-stones of epochs, that uprise Fixed, memorable, midst broad shallow flows Of neutrals, kill-times, sleeps, indifferencies. So twixt each morn and night rise salient heaps: Some cross with but a zigzag, jaded pace From meal to meal: some with convulsive leaps Shake the green tussocks of malign disgrace: And some advance by system and deep art O'er vantages of wealth, place, learning, tact. But thou within thyself, dear manifold heart, Dost bind all epochs in one dainty Fact. Oh, sweet, my pretty sum of history, I leapt the breadth of Time in loving thee! Baltimore, 1874â5. SPECIAL PLEADING. Time, hurry my Love to me: Haste, haste! Lov'st not good company? Here's but a heart-break sandy waste 'Twixt Now and Then. Why, killing haste Were best, dear Time, for thee, for thee! Oh, would that I might divine Thy name beyond the zodiac sign Wherefrom our times-to-come descend. He called thee Sometime. Change it, friend: Now-time sounds so much more fine! Sweet Sometime, fly fast to me: Poor Now-time sits in the Lonesome-tree And broods as gray as any dove, And calls, When wilt thou come, O Love? And pleads across the waste to thee. Good Moment, that giv'st him me, Wast ever in love? Maybe, maybe Thou'lt be this heavenly velvet time When Day and Night as rhyme and rhyme Set lip to lip dusk-modestly; Or haply some noon afar, âO life's top bud, mixt rose and star, How ever can thine utmost sweet Be star-consummate, rose-complete, Till thy rich reds full opened are? Well, be it dusk-time or noon-time, I ask but one small boon, Time: Come thou in night, come thou in day, I care not, I care not: have thine own way, But only, but only, come soon, Time. Baltimore, 1875. THE BEE. What time I paced, at pleasant morn, A deep and dewy wood, I heard a mellow hunting-horn Make dim report of Dian's lustihood Far down a heavenly hollow. Mine ear, though fain, had pain to follow: Tara it twanged, tara-tara! it blew, Yet wavered oft, and flew Most ficklewise about, or here, or there, A music now from earth and now from air. But on a sudden, lo! I marked a blossom shiver to and fro With dainty inward storm; and there within A down-drawn trump of yellow jessamine A bee Thrust up its sad-gold body lustily, All in a honey madness hotly bound On blissful burglary. A cunning sound In that wing-music held me: down I lay In amber shades of many a golden spray, Where looping low with languid arms the Vine In wreaths of ravishment did overtwine Her kneeling Live-Oak, thousand-fold to plight Herself unto her own true stalwart knight. As some dim blur of distant music nears The long-desiring sense, and slowly clears To forms of time and apprehensive tune, So, as I lay, full soon Interpretation throve: the bee's fanfare, Through sequent films of discourse vague as air, Passed to plain words, while, fanning faint perfume The bee o'erhung a rich, unrifled bloom: âO Earth, fair lordly Blossom, soft a-shine Upon the star-pranked universal vine, Hast nought for me? To thee Come I, a poet, hereward haply blown, From out another worldflower lately flown. Wilt ask, What profit e'er a poet brings? He beareth starry stuff about his wings To pollen thee and sting thee fertile: nay, If still thou narrow thy contracted way, âWorldflower, if thou refuse meâ âWorldflower, if thou abuse me, And hoist thy stamen's spear-point high To wound my wing and mar mine eyeâ Nathless I'll drive me to thy deepest sweet, Yea, richlier shall that pain the pollen beat From me to thee, for oft these pollens be Fine dust from wars that poets wage for thee. But, O beloved Earthbloom soft a-shine Upon the universal Jessamine, Prithee, abuse me not, Prithee, refuse me not, Yield, yield the heartsome honey love to me Hid in thy nectary!â And as I sank into a dimmer dream The pleading bee's song-burthen sole did seem âHast ne'er a honey-drop of love for me In thy huge nectary?â Tampa, Florida, 1877. THE HARLEQUIN OF DREAMS. Swift, through some trap mine eyes have never found Dim-panelled in the painted scene of Sleep, Thou, giant Harlequin of Dreams, dost leap Upon my spirit's stage. Then Sight and Sound, Then Space and Time, then Language, Mete and Bound, And all familiar Forms that firmly keep Man's reason in the road, change faces, peep Betwixt the legs and mock the daily round. Yet thou canst more than mock: sometimes my tears At midnight break through bounden lidsâa sign Thou hast a heart: and oft thy little leaven Of dream-taught wisdom works me bettered years. In one night witch, saint, trickster, fool divine, I think thou'rt Jester at the Court of Heaven! Baltimore, 1878. STREET-CRIES. Oft seems the Time a market-town Where many merchant-spirits meet Who up and down and up and down Cry out along the street Their needs, as wares; one thus, one so: Till all the ways are full of sound: âBut still come rain, and sun, and snow, And still the world goes round. I. REMONSTRANCE. âOpinion, let me alone: I am not thine. Prim Creed, with categoric point, forbear To feature me my Lord by rule and line. Thou canst not measure Mistress Nature's hair, Not one sweet inch: nay, if thy sight is sharp, Would'st count the strings upon an angel's harp? Forbear, forbear. âOh let me love my Lord more fathom deep Than there is line to sound with: let me love My fellow not as men that mandates keep: Yea, all that's lovable, below, above, That let me love by heart, by heart, because (Free from the penal pressure of the laws) I find it fair. âThe tears I weep by day and bitter night, Opinion! for thy sole salt vintage fall. âAs morn by morn I rise with fresh delight, Time through my casement cheerily doth call âNature is new,â 'tis birthday every day, Come feast with me, let no man say me nay, Whate'er befall.â âSo fare I forth to feast: I sit beside Some brother bright: but, ere good-morrow's passed, Burly Opinion wedging in hath cried âThou shalt not sit by us, to break thy fast, Save to our Rubric thou subscribe and swearâ Religion hath blue eyes and yellow hair: She's Saxon, all.â âThen, hard a-hungered for my brother's grace Till well-nigh fain to swear his folly's true, In sad dissent I turn my longing face To him that sits on the left: âBrother,âwith you?â ââNay, not with me, save thou subscribe and swear Religion hath black eyes and raven hair: Nought else is true.â âDebarred of banquets that my heart could make With every man on every day of life, I homeward turn, my fires of pain to slake In deep endearments of a worshipped wife. âI love thee well, dear Love,â quoth she, âand yet Would that thy creed with mine completely met, As one, not two.â âAssassin! Thief! Opinion, 'tis thy work. By Church, by throne, by hearth, by every good That's in the Town of Time, I see thee lurk, And e'er some shadow stays where thou hast stood. Thou hand'st sweet Socrates his hemlock sour; Thou sav'st Barabbas in that hideous hour, And stabb'st the good âDeliverer Christ; thou rack'st the souls of men; Thou tossest girls to lions and boys to flames; Thou hew'st Crusader down by Saracen; Thou buildest closets full of secret shames; Indifferent cruel, thou dost blow the blaze Round Ridley or Servetus; all thy days Smell scorched; I would ââThou base-born Accident of time and placeâ Bigot Pretender unto Judgment's throneâ Bastard, that claimest with a cunning face Those rights the true, true Son of Man doth own By Love's authorityâthou Rebel cold At head of civil wars and quarrels oldâ Thou Knife on a throneâ âI would thou left'st me free, to live with love, And faith, that through the love of love doth find My Lord's dear presence in the stars above, The clods below, the flesh without, the mind Within, the bread, the tear, the smile. Opinion, damned Intriguer, gray with guile, Let me alone.â Baltimore, 1878â9. II. THE SHIP OF EARTH. âThou Ship of Earth, with Death, and Birth, and Life, and Sex aboard, And fires of Desires burning hotly in the hold, I fear thee, O! I fear thee, for I hear the tongue and sword At battle on the deck, and the wild mutineers are bold! âThe dewdrop morn may fall from off the petal of the sky, But all the deck is wet with blood and stains the crystal red. A pilot, God, a pilot! for the helm is left awry, And the best sailors in the ship lie there among the dead!â Prattville, Alabama, 1868. III. HOW LOVE LOOKED FOR HELL. âTo heal his heart of long-time pain One day Prince Love for to travel was fain With Ministers Mind and Sense. âNow what to thee most strange may be?â Quoth Mind and Sense. âAll things above, One curious thing I first would seeâ Hell,â quoth Love. âThen Mind rode in and Sense rode out: They searched the ways of man about. First frightfully groaneth Sense. â'Tis here, 'tis here,â and spurreth in fear To the top of the hill that hangeth above And plucketh the Prince: âCome, come, 'tis hereâ âWhere?â quoth Loveâ ââNot far, not far,â said shivering Sense As they rode on. âA short way hence, âBut seventy paces hence: Look, King, dost see where suddenly This road doth dip from the height above? Cold blew a mouldy wind by meâ (âCold?â quoth Love) ââAs I rode down, and the River was black, And yon-side, lo! an endless wrack And rabble of souls,â sighed Sense, âTheir eyes upturned and begged and burned In brimstone lakes, and a Hand above Beat back the hands that upward yearnedââ âNay!â quoth Loveâ ââYea, yea, sweet Prince; thyself shalt see, Wilt thou but down this slope with me; 'Tis palpable,â whispered Sense. âAt the foot of the hill a living rill Shone, and the lilies shone white above; âBut now 'twas black, 'twas a river, this rill,â (âBlack?â quoth Love) ââAy, black, but lo! the lilies grow, And yon-side where was woe, was woe, âWhere the rabble of souls,â cried Sense, âDid shrivel and turn and beg and burn, Thrust back in the brimstone from aboveâ Is banked of violet, rose, and fern:â âHow?â quoth Love: ââFor lakes of pain, yon pleasant plain Of woods and grass and yellow grain Doth ravish the soul and sense: And never a sigh beneath the sky, And folk that smile and gaze aboveââ âBut saw'st thou here, with thine own eye, Hell?â quoth Love. ââI saw true hell with mine own eye, True hell, or light hath told a lie, True, verily,â quoth stout Sense. Then Love rode round and searched the ground, The caves below, the hills above; âBut I cannot find where thou hast found Hell,â quoth Love. âThere, while they stood in a green wood And marvelled still on Ill and Good, Came suddenly Minister Mind. âIn the heart of sin doth hell begin: 'Tis not below, 'tis not above, It lieth within, it lieth within:â (âWhere?â quoth Love) ââI saw a man sit by a corse; Hell's in the murderer's breast: remorse! Thus clamored his mind to his mind: Not fleshly dole is the sinner's goal, Hell's not below, nor yet above, 'Tis fixed in the ever-damnÃ¨d soulââ âFixed?â quoth Loveâ ââFixed: follow me, would'st thou but see: He weepeth under yon willow tree, Fast chained to his corse,â quoth Mind. Full soon they passed, for they rode fast, Where the piteous willow bent above. âNow shall I see at last, at last, Hell,â quoth Love. âThere when they came Mind suffered shame: âThese be the same and not the same,â A-wondering whispered Mind. Lo, face by face two spirits pace Where the blissful willow waves above: One saith: âDo me a friendly graceââ (âGrace!â quoth Love) ââRead me two Dreams that linger long, Dim as returns of old-time song That flicker about the mind. I dreamed (how deep in mortal sleep!) I struck thee dead, then stood above, With tears that none but dreamers weep;â âDreams,â quoth Love; ââIn dreams, again, I plucked a flower That clung with pain and stung with power, Yea, nettled me, body and mind.â â'Twas the nettle of sin, 'twas medicine; No need nor seed of it here Above; In dreams of hate true loves begin.â âTrue,â quoth Love. ââNow strange,â quoth Sense, and âStrange,â quoth Mind âWe saw it, and yet 'tis hard to find, âBut we saw it,â quoth Sense and Mind. Stretched on the ground, beautiful-crowned Of the piteous willow that wreathed above, But I cannot find where ye have found Hell,â quoth Love.â Baltimore, 1878â9. IV. TYRANNY. âSpring-germs, spring-germs, I charge you by your life, go back to death. This glebe is sick, this wind is foul of breath. Stay: feed the worms. âOh! every clod Is faint, and falters from the war of growth And crumbles in a dreary dust of sloth, Unploughed, untrod. âWhat need, what need, To hide with flowers the curse upon the hills, Or sanctify the banks of sluggish rills Where vapors breed? âAndâif needs mustâ Advance, O Summer-heats! upon the land, And bake the bloody mould to shards and sand And dust. âBefore your birth, Burn up, O Roses! with your dainty flame. Good Violets, sweet Violets, hide shame Below the earth. âYe silent Mills, Reject the bitter kindness of the moss. O Farms! protest if any tree emboss The barren hills. âYoung Trade is dead, And swart Work sullen sits in the hillside fern And folds his arms that find no bread to earn, And bows his head. âSpring-germs, spring-germs, Albeit the towns have left you place to play, I charge you, sport not. Winter owns to-day, Stay: feed the worms.â Prattville, Alabama, 1868. V. LIFE AND SONG. âIf life were caught by a clarionet, And a wild heart, throbbing in the reed, Should thrill its joy and trill its fret, And utter its heart in every deed, âThen would this breathing clarionet Type what the poet fain would be; For none o' the singers ever yet Has wholly lived his minstrelsy, âOr clearly sung his true, true thought, Or utterly bodied forth his life, Or out of life and song has wrought The perfect one of man and wife; âOr lived and sung, that Life and Song Might each express the other's all, Careless if life or art were long Since both were one, to stand or fall, âSo that the wonder struck the crowd, Who shouted it about the land: His song was only living aloud, His work, a singing with his hand!â 1868. VI. TO RICHARD WAGNER. âI saw a sky of stars that rolled in grime. All glory twinkled through some sweat of fight, From each tall chimney of the roaring time That shot his fire far up the sooty night Mixt fuelsâLabor's Right and Labor's Crimeâ Sent upward throb on throb of scarlet light Till huge hot blushes in the heavens blent With golden hues of Trade's high firmament. âFierce burned the furnaces; yet all seemed well, Hope dreamed rich music in the rattling mills. âYe foundries, ye shall cast my church a bell,â Loud cried the Future from the farthest hills: âYe groaning forces, crack me every shell Of customs, old constraints, and narrow ills; Thou, lithe Invention, wake and pry and guess, Till thy deft mind invents me Happiness.â âAnd I beheld high scaffoldings of creeds Crumbling from round Religion's perfect Fane: And a vast noise of rights, wrongs, powers, needs, âCries of new Faiths that called âThis Way is plain,â âGrindings of upper against lower greedsâ âFond sighs for old things, shouts for new,âdid reign Below that stream of golden fire that broke, Mottled with red, above the seas of smoke. âHark! Gay fanfares from halls of old Romance Strike through the clouds of clamor: who be these That, paired in rich processional, advance From darkness o'er the murk mad factories Into yon flaming road, and sink, strange Ministrants! Sheer down to earth, with many minstrelsies And motions fine, and mix about the scene And fill the Time with forms of ancient mien? âBright ladies and brave knights of Fatherland; Sad mariners, no harbor e'er may hold, A swan soft floating tow'rds a magic strand; Dim ghosts, of earth, air, water, fire, steel, gold, Wind, grief, and love; a lewd and lurking band Of Powersâdark Conspiracy, Cunning cold, Gray Sorcery; magic cloaks and rings and rods; Valkyries, heroes, Rhinemaids, giants, gods! âO Wagner, westward bring thy heavenly art, No trifler thou: Siegfried and Wotan be Names for big ballads of the modern heart. Thine ears hear deeper than thine eyes can see. Voice of the monstrous mill, the shouting mart, Not less of airy cloud and wave and tree, Thou, thou, if even to thyself unknown, Hast power to say the Time in terms of tone.â 1877. VII. A SONG OF LOVE. âHey, rose, just born Twin to a thorn; Was't so with you, O Love and Scorn? âSweet eyes that smiled, Now wet and wild; O Eye and Tearâmother and child. âWell: Love and Pain Be kinsfolk twain: Yet would, Oh would I could love again.â TO BEETHOVEN. In o'er-strict calyx lingering, Lay music's bud too long unblown, Till thou, Beethoven, breathed the spring: Then bloomed the perfect rose of tone. O Psalmist of the weak, the strong, O Troubadour of love and strife, Co-Litanist of right and wrong, Sole Hymner of the whole of life, I know not how, I care not why,â Thy music sets my world at ease, And melts my passion's mortal cry In satisfying symphonies. It soothes my accusations sour 'Gainst thoughts that fray the restless soul: The stain of death; the pain of power; The lack of love 'twixt part and whole; The yea-nay of Freewill and Fate, Whereof both cannot be, yet are; The praise a poet wins too late Who starves from earth into a star; The lies that serve great parties well, While truths but give their Christ a cross; The loves that send warm souls to hell, While cold-blood neuters take no loss; Th' indifferent smile that nature's grace On Jesus, Judas, pours alike; Th' indifferent frown on nature's face When luminous lightnings strangely strike The sailor praying on his knees And spare his mate that's cursing God; How babes and widows starve and freeze, Yet Nature will not stir a clod; Why Nature blinds us in each act Yet makes no law in mercy bend, No pitfall from our feet retract, No storm cry out Take shelter, friend; Why snakes that crawl the earth should ply Rattles, that whoso hears may shun, While serpent lightnings in the sky, But rattle when the deed is done; How truth can e'er be good for them That have not eyes to bear its strength, And yet how stern our lights condemn Delays that lend the darkness length; To know all things, save knowingness; To grasp, yet loosen, feeling's rein; To waste no manhood on success; To look with pleasure upon pain; Though teased by small mixt social claims, To lose no large simplicity, And midst of clear-seen crimes and shames To move with manly purity; To hold, with keen, yet loving eyes, Art's realm from Cleverness apart, To know the Clever good and wise, Yet haunt the lonesome heights of Art; O Psalmist of the weak, the strong, O Troubadour of love and strife, Co-Litanist of right and wrong, Sole Hymner of the whole of life, I know not how, I care not why, Thy music brings this broil at ease, And melts my passion's mortal cry In satisfying symphonies. Yea, it forgives me all my sins, Fits life to love like rhyme to rhyme, And tunes the task each day begins By the last trumpet-note of Time. 1876â7. TO NANNETTE FALK-AUERBACH. Oft as I hear thee, wrapt in heavenly art, The massive message of Beethoven tell With thy ten fingers to the people's heart As if ten tongues told news of heaven and hell,â Gazing on thee, I mark that not alone, Ah, not alone, thou sittest: there, by thee, Beethoven's self, dear living lord of tone, Doth stand and smile upon thy mastery. Full fain and fatherly his great eyes glow: He says, âFrom Heaven, my child, I heard thee call (For, where an artist plays, the sky is low): Yea, since my lonesome life did lack love's all, In death, God gives me thee: thus, quit of pain, Daughter, Nannette! in thee I live again.â Baltimore, 1878. TO OUR MOCKING-BIRD. DIED OF A CAT, MAY, 1878. I. Trillets of humor,âshrewdest whistle-wit,â Contralto cadences of grave desire Such as from off the passionate Indian pyre Drift down through sandal-odored flames that split About the slim young widow who doth sit And sing above,âmidnights of tone entire,â Tissues of moonlight shot with songs of fire;â Bright drops of tune, from oceans infinite Of melody, sipped off the thin-edged wave And trickling down the beak,âdiscourses brave Of serious matter that no man may guess,â Good-fellow greetings, cries of light distressâ All these but now within the house we heard: O Death, wast thou too deaf to hear the bird? II. Ah me, though never an ear for song, thou hast A tireless tooth for songsters: thus of late Thou camest, Death, thou Cat! and leap'st my gate, And, long ere Love could follow, thou hadst passed Within and snatched away, how fast, how fast, My birdâwit, songs, and allâthy richest freight Since that fell time when in some wink of fate Thy yellow claws unsheathed and stretched, and cast Sharp hold on Keats, and dragged him slow away, And harried him with hope and horrid playâ Ay, him, the world's best wood-bird, wise with songâ Till thou hadst wrought thine own last mortal wrong. 'Twas wrong! 'twas wrong! I care not, wrong's the wordâ To munch our Keats and crunch our mocking-bird. III. Nay, Bird; my grief gainsays the Lord's best right. The Lord was fain, at some late festal time, That Keats should set all Heaven's woods in rhyme, And thou in bird-notes. Lo, this tearful night, Methinks I see thee, fresh from death's despite, Perched in a palm-grove, wild with pantomime, O'er blissful companies couched in shady thyme, âMethinks I hear thy silver whistlings bright Mix with the mighty discourse of the wise, Till broad Beethoven, deaf no more, and Keats, 'Midst of much talk, uplift their smiling eyes, And mark the music of thy wood-conceits, And halfway pause on some large, courteous word, And call thee âBrother,â O thou heavenly Bird! Baltimore, 1878. THE DOVE. If haply thou, O Desdemona Morn, Shouldst call along the curving sphere, âRemain, Dear Night, sweet Moor; nay, leave me not in scorn!â With soft halloos of heavenly love and pain;â Shouldst thou, O Spring! a-cower in coverts dark, 'Gainst proud supplanting Summer sing thy plea, And move the mighty woods through mailÃ¨d bark Till mortal heart-break throbbed in every tree;â Or (grievous if that may be yea o'er-soon!), If thou, my Heart, long holden from thy Sweet, Shouldst knock Death's door with mellow shocks of tune, Sad inquiry to makeâWhen may we meet? Nay, if ye three, O Morn! O Spring! O Heart! Should chant grave unisons of grief and love; Ye could not mourn with more melodious art Than daily doth yon dim sequestered dove. Chadd's Ford, Pennsylvania, 1877. TO ?, WITH A ROSE. I asked my heart to say Some word whose worth my love's devoir might pay Upon my Lady's natal day. Then said my heart to me: Learn from the rhyme that now shall come to thee What fits thy Love most lovingly. This gift that learning shows; For, as a rhyme unto its rhyme-twin goes, I send a rose unto a Rose. Philadelphia, 1876. ON HUNTINGDON'S âMIRANDA.â The storm hath blown thee a lover, sweet, And laid him kneeling at thy feet. But,âguerdon rich for favor rare! The wind hath all thy holy hair To kiss and to sing through and to flare Like torch-flames in the passionate air, About thee, O Miranda. Eyes in a blaze, eyes in a daze, Bold with love, cold with amaze, Chaste-thrilling eyes, fast-filling eyes With daintiest tears of love's surprise, Ye draw my soul unto your blue As warm skies draw the exhaling dew, Divine eyes of Miranda. And if I were yon stolid stone, Thy tender arm doth lean upon, Thy touch would turn me to a heart, And I would palpitate and start, âContent, when thou wert gone, to be A dumb rock by the lonesome sea Forever, O Miranda. Baltimore, 1874. ODE TO THE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY. READ ON THE FOURTH COMMEMORATION DAY, FEBRUARY, 1880. How tall among her sisters, and how fair,â How grave beyond her youth, yet debonair As dawn, 'mid wrinkled Matres of old lands Our youngest Alma Mater modest stands! In four brief cycles round the punctual sun Has she, old Learning's latest daughter, won This grace, this stature, and this fruitful fame. Howbeit she was born Unnoised as any stealing summer morn. From far the sages saw, from far they came And ministered to her, Led by the soaring-genius'd Sylvester That, earlier, loosed the knot great Newton tied, And flung the door of Fame's locked temple wide. As favorable fairies thronged of old and blessed The cradled princess with their several best, So, gifts and dowers meet To lay at Wisdom's feet, These liberal masters largely broughtâ Dear diamonds of their long-compressÃ¨d thought, Rich stones from out the labyrinthine cave Of research, pearls from Time's profoundest wave And many a jewel brave, of brilliant ray, Dug in the far obscure Cathay Of meditation deepâ With flowers, of such as keep Their fragrant tissues and their heavenly hues Fresh-bathed forever in eternal dewsâ The violet with her low-drooped eye, For learnÃ¨d modesty,â The student snow-drop, that doth hang and pore Upon the earth, like Science, evermore, And underneath the clod doth grope and grope,â The astronomer heliotrope, That watches heaven with a constant eye,â The daring crocus, unafraid to try (When Nature calls) the February snows,â And patience' perfect rose. Thus sped with helps of love and toil and thought, Thus forwarded of faith, with hope thus fraught, In four brief cycles round the stringent sun This youngest sister hath her stature won. Nay, why regard The passing of the years? Nor made, nor marr'd, By help or hindrance of slow Time was she: O'er this fair growth Time had no mastery: So quick she bloomed, she seemed to bloom at birth, As Eve from Adam, or as he from earth. Superb o'er slow increase of day on day, Complete as Pallas she began her way; Yet not from Jove's unwrinkled forehead sprung, But long-time dreamed, and out of trouble wrung, Fore-seen, wise-plann'd, pure child of thought and pain, Leapt our Minerva from a mortal brain. And here, O finer Pallas, long remain,â Sit on these Maryland hills, and fix thy reign, And frame a fairer Athens than of yore In these blest bounds of Baltimore,â Here, where the climates meet That each may make the other's lack complete,â Where Florida's soft Favonian airs beguile The nipping North,âwhere nature's powers smile,â Where Chesapeake holds frankly forth her hands Spread wide with invitation to all lands,â Where now the eager people yearn to find The organizing hand that fast may bind Loose straws of aimless aspiration fain In sheaves of serviceable grain,â Here, old and new in one, Through nobler cycles round a richer sun O'er-rule our modern ways, O blest Minerva of these larger days! Call here thy congress of the great, the wise, The hearing ears, the seeing eyes,â Enrich us out of every farthest clime,â Yea, make all ages native to our time, Till thou the freedom of the city grant To each most antique habitant Of Fame,â Bring Shakspere back, a man and not a name,â Let every player that shall mimic us In audience see old godlike Ãschylus,â Bring Homer, Dante, Plato, Socrates,â Bring Virgil from the visionary seas Of old romance,âbring Milton, no more blind,â Bring large Lucretius, with unmaniac mind,â Bring all gold hearts and high resolvÃ¨d wills To be with us about these happy hills,â Bring old Renown To walk familiar citizen of the town,â Bring Tolerance, that can kiss and disagree,â Bring Virtue, Honor, Truth, and Loyalty,â Bring Faith that sees with undissembling eyes,â Bring all large Loves and heavenly Charities,â Till man seem less a riddle unto man And fair Utopia less Utopian, And many peoples call from shore to shore, The world has bloomed again, at Baltimore! Baltimore, 1880. TO DR. THOMAS SHEARER. PRESENTING A PORTRAIT-BUST OF THE AUTHOR. Since you, rare friend! have tied my living tongue With thanks more large than man e'er said or sung, So let the dumbness of this image be My eloquence, and still interpret me. Baltimore, 1880. MARTHA WASHINGTON. WRITTEN FOR THE âMARTHA WASHINGTON COURT JOURNAL.â Down cold snow-stretches of our bitter time, When windy shams and the rain-mocking sleet Of Trade have cased us in such icy rime That hearts are scarcely hot enough to beat, Thy fame, O Lady of the lofty eyes, Doth fall along the age, like as a lane Of Spring, in whose most generous boundaries Full many a frozen virtue warms again. To-day I saw the pale much-burdened form Of Charity come limping o'er the line, And straighten from the bending of the storm And flush with stirrings of new strength divine, Such influence and sweet gracious impulse came Out of the beams of thine immortal name! Baltimore, February 22d, 1875. PSALM OF THE WEST. Land of the willful gospel, thou worst and thou best; Tall Adam of lands, new-made of the dust of the West; Thou wroughtest alone in the Garden of God, unblest Till He fashioned lithe Freedom to lie for thine Eve on thy breastâ Till out of thy heart's dear neighborhood, out of thy side, He fashioned an intimate Sweet one and brought thee a Bride. Cry hail! nor bewail that the wound of her coming was wide. Lo, Freedom reached forth where the world as an apple hung red; Let us taste the whole radiant round of it, gayly she said: If we die, at the worst we shall lie as the first of the dead. Knowledge of Good and of Ill, O Land! she hath given thee; Perilous godhoods of choosing have rent thee and riven thee; Will's high adoring to Ill's low exploring hath driven theeâ Freedom, thy Wife, hath uplifted thy life and clean shriven thee! Her shalt thou clasp for a balm to the scars of thy breast, Her shalt thou kiss for a calm to thy wars of unrest, Her shalt extol in the psalm of the soul of the West. For Weakness, in freedom, grows stronger than Strength with a chain; And Error, in freedom, will come to lamenting his stain, Till freely repenting he whiten his spirit again; And Friendship, in freedom, will blot out the bounding of race; And straight Law, in freedom, will curve to the rounding of grace; And Fashion, in freedom, will die of the lie in her face; And Desire flame white on the sense as a fire on a height, And Sex flame white in the soul as a star in the night, And Marriage plight sense unto soul as the two-colored light Of the fire and the star shines one with a duplicate might; And Science be known as the sense making love to the All, And Art be known as the soul making love to the All, And Love be known as the marriage of man with the Allâ Till Science to knowing the Highest shall lovingly turn, Till Art to loving the Highest shall consciously burn, Till Science to Art as a man to a woman shall yearn,âThen morn! When Faith from the wedding of Knowing and Loving shall purely be born, And the Child shall smile in the West, and the West to the East give morn, And the Time in that ultimate Prime shall forget old regretting and scorn, Yea, the stream of the light shall give off in a shimmer the dream of the night forlorn. Once on a time a soul Too full of his dole In a querulous dream went crying from pole to poleâ Went sobbing and crying For ever a sorrowful song of living and dying, How life was the dropping and death the drying Of a Tear that fell in a day when God was sighing. And ever Time tossed him bitterly to and fro As a shuttle inlaying a perilous warp of woe In the woof of things from terminal snow to snow, Till, lo! Rest. And he sank on the grass of the earth as a lark on its nest, And he lay in the midst of the way from the east to the west. Then the East came out from the east and the West from the west, And, behold! in the gravid deeps of the lower dark, While, above, the wind was fanning the dawn as a spark, The East and the West took form as the wings of a lark. One wing was feathered with facts of the uttermost Past, And one with the dreams of a prophet; and both sailed fast And met where the sorrowful Soul on the earth was cast. Then a Voice said: Thine, if thou lovest enough to use; But another: To fly and to sing is pain: refuse! Then the Soul said: Come, O my wings! I cannot but choose. And the Soul was a-tremble like as a new-born thing, Till the spark of the dawn wrought a conscience in heart as in wing, Saying, Thou art the lark of the dawn; it is time to sing. Then that artist began in a lark's low circling to pass; And first he sang at the height of the top of the grass A song of the herds that are born and die in the mass. And next he sang a celestial-passionate round At the height of the lips of a woman above the ground, How Love was a fair true Lady, and Death a wild hound, And she called, and he licked her hand and with girdle was bound. And then with a universe-love he was hot in the wings, And the sun stretched beams to the worlds as the shining strings Of the large hid harp that sounds when an all-lover sings; And the sky's blue traction prevailed o'er the earth's in might, And the passion of flight grew mad with the glory of height And the uttering of song was like to the giving of light; And he learned that hearing and seeing wrought nothing alone, And that music on earth much light upon Heaven had thrown, And he melted-in silvery sunshine with silvery tone; And the spirals of music e'er higher and higher he wound Till the luminous cinctures of melody up from the ground Arose as the shaft of a tapering tower of soundâ Arose for an unstricken full-finished Babel of sound. But God was not angry, nor ever confused his tongue, For not out of selfish nor impudent travail was wrung The song of all men and all things that the all-lover sung. Then he paused at the top of his tower of song on high, And the voice of the God of the artist from far in the sky Said, Son, look down: I will cause that a Time gone by Shall pass, and reveal his heart to thy loving eye. Far spread, below, The sea that fast hath locked in his loose flow All secrets of Atlantis' drownÃ¨d woe Lay bound about with night on every hand, Save down the eastern brink a shining band Of day made out a little way from land. Then from that shore the wind upbore a cry: Thou Sea, thou Sea of Darkness! why, oh why Dost waste thy West in unthrift mystery? But ever the idiot sea-mouths foam and fill, And never a wave doth good for man or ill, And Blank is king, and Nothing hath his will; And like as grim-beaked pelicans level file Across the sunset toward their nightly isle On solemn wings that wave but seldomwhile, So leanly sails the day behind the day To where the Past's lone Rock o'erglooms the spray, And down its mortal fissures sinks away. Master, Master, break this ban: The wave lacks Thee. Oh, is it not to widen man Stretches the sea? Oh, must the sea-bird's idle van Alone be free? Into the Sea of the Dark doth creep BjÃ¶rne's pallid sail, As the face of a walker in his sleep, Set rigid and most pale, About the night doth peer and peep In a dream of an ancient tale. Lo, here is made a hasty cry: Land, land, upon the west!â God save such land! Go by, go by: Here may no mortal rest, Where this waste hell of slate doth lie And grind the glacier's breast. The sail goeth limp: hey, flap and strain! Round eastward slanteth the mast; As the sleep-walker waked with pain, White-clothed in the midnight blast, Doth stare and quake, and stride again To houseward all aghast. Yet as, A ghost! his household cry: He hath followed a ghost in flight. Let us see the ghostâhis household fly With lamps to search the nightâ So Norsemen's sails run out and try The Sea of the Dark with light. Stout Are Marson, southward whirled From out the tempest's hand, Doth skip the sloping of the world To Huitramannaland, Where Georgia's oaks with moss-beards curled Wave by the shining strand, And sway in sighs from Florida's Spring Or Carolina's Palmâ What time the mocking-bird doth bring The woods his artist's-balm, Singing the Song of Everything Consummate-sweet and calmâ Land of large merciful-hearted skies, Big bounties, rich increase, Green rests for Trade's blood-shotten eyes, For o'er-beat brains surcease, For Love the dear woods' sympathies, For Grief the wise woods' peace, For Need rich givings of hid powers In hills and vales quick-won, For Greed large exemplary flowers That ne'er have toiled nor spun, For Heat fair-tempered winds and showers, For Cold the neighbor sun. Land where the Spirits of June-Heat From out their forest-maze Stray forth at eve with loitering feet, And fervent hymns upraise In bland accord and passion sweet Along the Southern ways:â âO Darkness, tawny Twin whose Twin hath ceased, Thou Odor from the day-flower's crushing born, Thou visible Sigh out of the mournful East, That cannot see her lord again till morn: O Leaves, with hollow palms uplifted high To catch the stars' most sacred rain of light: O pallid Lily-petals fain to die Soul-stung by subtle passion of the night: O short-breath'd Winds beneath the gracious moon Running mild errands for mild violets, Or carrying sighs from the red lips of June What wavering way the odor-current sets: O Stars wreathed vinewise round yon heavenly dells, Or thrust from out the sky in curving sprays, Or whorled, or looped with pendent flower-bells, Or bramble-tangled in a brilliant maze, Or lying like young lilies in a lake About the great white Lily of the moon, Or drifting white from where in heaven shake Star-portraitures of apple trees in June, Or lapp'd as leaves of a great rose of stars, Or shyly clambering up cloud-lattices, Or trampled pale in the red path of Mars, Or trim-set quaint in gardeners'-fantasies: O long June Night-sounds crooned among the leaves; O whispered confidence of Dark and Green; O murmurs in old moss about old eaves; O tinklings floating over water-sheen.â Then Leif, bold son of Eric the Red, To the South of the West doth fleeâ Past slaty Helluland is sped, Past Markland's woody lea, Till round about fair Vinland's head, Where Taunton helps the sea, The Norseman calls, the anchor falls, The mariners hurry a-strand: They wassail with fore-drunken skals Where prophet wild grapes stand; They lift the Leifsbooth's hasty walls They stride about the landâ New England, thee! whose ne'er-spent wine As blood doth stretch each vein, And urge thee, sinewed like thy vine, Through peril and all pain To grasp Endeavor's towering Pine, And, once ahold, remainâ Land where the strenuous-handed Wind With sarcasm of a friend Doth smite the man would lag behind To frontward of his end; Yea, where the taunting fall and grind Of Nature's Ill doth send Such mortal challenge of a clown Rude-thrust upon the soul, That men but smile where mountains frown Or scowling waters roll, And Nature's front of battle down Do hurl from pole to pole. Now long the Sea of Darkness glimmers low With sails from Northland flickering to and froâ Thorwald, Karlsefne, and those twin heirs of woe, Hellboge and Finnage, in treasonable bed Slain by the ill-born child of Eric Red, Freydisa false. Till, as much time is fled, Once more the vacant airs with darkness fill, Once more the wave doth never good nor ill, And Blank is king, and Nothing works his will; And leanly sails the day behind the day To where the Past's lone Rock o'erglooms the spray, And down its mortal fissures sinks away, As when the grim-beaked pelicans level file Across the sunset to their seaward isle On solemn wings that wave but seldomwhile. Master, Master, poets sing; The Time calls Thee; Yon Sea binds hard on everything Man longs to be: Oh, shall the sea-bird's aimless wing Alone move free? Santa Maria, well thou tremblest down the wave, Thy Pinta far abow, thy NiÃ±a nigh astern: Columbus stands in the night alone, and, passing grave, Yearns o'er the sea as tones o'er under-silence yearn. Heartens his heart as friend befriends his friend less brave, Makes burn the faiths that cool, and cools the doubts that burn:â I. â'Twixt this and dawn, three hours my soul will smite With prickly seconds, or less tolerably With dull-blade minutes flatwise slapping me. Wait, Heart! Time moves.âThou lithe young Western Night, Just-crownÃ¨d king, slow riding to thy right, Would God that I might straddle mutiny Calm as thou sitt'st yon never-managed sea, Balk'st with his balking, fliest with his flight, Giv'st supple to his rearings and his falls, Nor dropp'st one coronal star about thy brow Whilst ever dayward thou art steadfast drawn! Yea, would I rode these mad contentious brawls No damage taking from their If and How, Nor no result save galloping to my Dawn! II. âMy Dawn? my Dawn? How if it never break? How if this West by other Wests is pieced, And these by vacant Wests on Wests increasedâ One Pain of Space, with hollow ache on ache Throbbing and ceasing not for Christ's own sake?â Big perilous theorem, hard for king and priest: Pursue the West but long enough, 'tis East! Oh, if this watery world no turning take! Oh, if for all my logic, all my dreams, Provings of that which is by that which seems, Fears, hopes, chills, heats, hastes, patiences, droughts, tears, Wise-grievings, slights on love, embezzled years, Hates, treaties, scorns, upliftings, loss and gain,â This earth, no sphere, be all one sickening plane! III. âOr, haply, how if this contrarious West, That me by turns hath starved, by turns hath fed, Embraced, disgraced, beat back, solicited, Have no fixed heart of Law within his breast, Or with some different rhythm doth e'er contest Nature in the East? Why, 'tis but three weeks fled I saw my Judas needle shake his head And flout the Pole that, east, he Lord confessed! God! if this West should own some other Pole, And with his tangled ways perplex my soul Until the maze grow mortal, and I die Where distraught Nature clean hath gone astray, On earth some other wit than Time's at play, Some other God than mine above the sky! IV. âNow speaks mine other heart with cheerier seeming: Ho, Admiral! o'er-defalking to thy crew Against thyself, thyself far overfew To front yon multitudes of rebel scheming? Come, ye wild twenty years of heavenly dreaming! Come, ye wild weeks since first this canvas drew Out of vexed Palos ere the dawn was blue, O'er milky waves about the bows full-creaming! Come set me round with many faithful spears Of confident remembranceâhow I crushed Cat-lived rebellions, pitfalled treasons, hushed Scared husbands' heart-break cries on distant wives, Made cowards blush at whining for their lives, Watered my parching souls, and dried their tears. V. âEre we Gomera cleared, a coward cried, Turn, turn: here be three caravels ahead, From Portugal, to take us: we are dead! Hold Westward, pilot, calmly I replied. So when the last land down the horizon died, Go back, go back! they prayed: our hearts are lead.â Friends, we are bound into the West, I said. Then passed the wreck of a mast upon our side. See (so they wept) God's Warning! Admiral, turn!â Steersman, I said, hold straight into the West. Then down the night we saw the meteor burn. So do the very heavens in fire protest: Good Admiral, put about! O Spain, dear Spain!â Hold straight into the West, I said again. VI. âNext drive we o'er the slimy-weeded sea. Lo! herebeneath! (another coward cries) The cursÃ¨d land of sunk Atlantis lies: This slime will suck us downâturn while thou'rt free!â But no! I said, Freedom bears West for me! Yet when the long-time stagnant winds arise, And day by day the keel to westward flies, My Good my people's Ill doth come to be: Ever the winds into the West do blow; Never a ship, once turned, might homeward go; Meanwhile we speed into the lonesome main. For Christ's sake, parley, Admiral! Turn, before We sail outside all bounds of help from pain!â Our help is in the West, I said once more. VII. âSo when there came a mighty cry of Land! And we clomb up and saw, and shouted strong Salve Regina! all the ropes along, But knew at morn how that a counterfeit band Of level clouds had aped a silver strand; So when we heard the orchard-bird's small song, And all the people cried, A hellish throng To tempt us onward by the Devil planned, Yea, all from hellâkeen heron, fresh green weeds, Pelican, tunny-fish, fair tapering reeds, Lie-telling lands that ever shine and die In clouds of nothing round the empty sky. Tired Admiral, get thee from this hell, and rest!â Steersman, I said, hold straight into the West. VIII. âI marvel how mine eye, ranging the Night, From its big circling ever absently Returns, thou large low Star, to fix on thee. Maria! Star? No star: a Light, a Light! Wouldst leap ashore, Heart? Yonder burnsâa Light. Pedro Gutierrez, wake! come up to me. I prithee stand and gaze about the sea: What seest? Admiral, like as landâa Light! Well! Sanchez of Segovia, come and try: What seest? Admiral, naught but sea and sky! Well! But I saw It. Wait! the Pinta's gun! Why, look, 'tis dawn, the land is clear: 'tis done! Two dawns do break at once from Time's full handâ God's, Eastâmine, West: good friends, behold my Land!â Master, Master! faster fly Now the hurrying seasons by; Now the Sea of Darkness wide Rolls in light from side to side; Mark, slow drifting to the West Down the trough and up the crest, Yonder piteous heartsease petal Many-motioned rise and settleâ Petal cast a-sea from land By the awkward-fingered Hand That, mistaking Nature's course, Tears the love it fain would forceâ Petal calm of heartsease flower Smiling sweet on tempest sour, Smiling where by crest and trough Heartache Winds at heartsease scoff, Breathing mild perfumes of prayer 'Twixt the scolding sea and air. Mayflower, piteous Heartsease Petal! Suavely down the sea-troughs settle, Gravely breathe perfumes of prayer 'Twixt the scolding sea and air, Bravely up the sea-hills riseâ Sea-hills slant thee toward the skies. Master, hold disaster off From the crest and from the trough; Heartsease, on the heartache sea God, thy God, will pilot thee. Mayflower, Ship of Faith's best Hope! Thou art sure if all men grope; Mayflower, Ship of Hope's best Faith! All is true the great God saith; Mayflower, Ship of Charity! Love is Lord of land and sea. Oh, with love and love's best care Thy large godly freightage bearâ Godly Hearts that, Grails of gold, Still the blood of Faith do hold. Now bold Massachusetts clear Cuts the rounding of the sphere. Out the anchor, sail no more, Lay us by the Future's shoreâ Not the shore we sought, 'tis true, But the time is come to do. Leap, dear Standish, leap and wade; Bradford, Hopkins, Tilley, wade: Leap and wade ashore and kneelâ God be praised that steered the keel! Home is good and soft is rest, Even in this jagged West: Freedom lives, and Right shall stand; Blood of Faith is in the land. Then in what time the primal icy years Scraped slowly o'er the Puritans' hopes and fears, Like as great glaciers built of frozen tears, The Voice from far within the secret sky Said, Blood of Faith ye have? So; let us try. And presently The anxious-masted ships that westward fare, Cargo'd with trouble and a-list with care, Their outraged decks hot back to England bear, Then come again with stowage of worse weight, Battle, and tyrannous Tax, and Wrong, and Hate And all bad items of Death's perilous freight. O'er Cambridge set the yeomen's mark: Climb, patriot, through the April dark. O lanthorn! kindle fast thy light, Thou budding star in the April night, For never a star more news hath told, Or later flame in heaven shall hold. Ay, lanthorn on the North Church tower, When that thy church hath had her hour, Still from the top of Reverence high Shalt thou illume Fame's ampler sky; For, statured large o'er town and tree, Time's tallest Figure stands by thee, And, dim as now thy wick may shine The Future lights his lamp at thine. Now haste thee while the way is clear, Paul Revere! Haste, Dawes! but haste thou not, O Sun! To Lexington. Then Devens looked and saw the light: He got him forth into the night, And watched alone on the river-shore, And marked the British ferrying o'er. John Parker! rub thine eyes and yawn: But one o'clock and yet 'tis Dawn! Quick, rub thine eyes and draw thy hose: The Morning comes ere darkness goes. Have forth and call the yeomen out, For somewhere, somewhere close about Full soon a Thing must come to be Thine honest eyes shall stare to seeâ Full soon before thy patriot eyes Freedom from out of a Wound shall rise. Then haste ye, Prescott and Revere! Bring all the men of Lincoln here; Let Chelmsford, Littleton, Carlisle, Let Acton, Bedford, hither fileâ Oh hither file, and plainly see Out of a wound leap Liberty. Say, Woodman April! all in green, Say, Robin April! hast thou seen In all thy travel round the earth Ever a morn of calmer birth? But Morning's eye alone serene Can gaze across yon village-green To where the trooping British run Through Lexington. Good men in fustian, stand ye still; The men in red come o'er the hill. Lay down your arms, damned Rebels! cry The men in red full haughtily. But never a grounding gun is heard; The men in fustian stand unstirred; Dead calm, save maybe a wise bluebird Puts in his little heavenly word. O men in red! if ye but knew The half as much as bluebirds do, Now in this little tender calm Each hand would out, and every palm With patriot palm strike brotherhood's stroke Or ere these lines of battle broke. O men in red! if ye but knew The least of the all that bluebirds do, Now in this little godly calm Yon voice might sing the Future's Psalmâ The Psalm of Love with the brotherly eyes Who pardons and is very wiseâ Yon voice that shouts, high-hoarse with ire, Fire! The red-coats fire, the homespuns fall: The homespuns' anxious voices call, Brother, art hurt? and Where hit, John? And, Wipe this blood, and Men, come on, And, Neighbor, do but lift my head, And Who is wounded? Who is dead? Seven are killed. My God! my God! Seven lie dead on the village sod. Two Harringtons, Parker, Hadley, Brown, Monroe and Porter,âthese are down. Nay, look! Stout Harrington not yet dead! He crooks his elbow, lifts his head. He lies at the step of his own house-door; He crawls and makes a path of gore. The wife from the window hath seen, and rushed; He hath reached the step, but the blood hath gushed; He hath crawled to the step of his own house-door, But his head hath dropped: he will crawl no more. Clasp, Wife, and kiss, and lift the head: Harrington lies at his doorstep dead. But, O ye Six that round him lay And bloodied up that April day! As Harrington fell, ye likewise fellâ At the door of the House wherein ye dwell; As Harrington came, ye likewise came And died at the door of your House of Fame. Go by, old Field of Freedom's hopes and fears; Go by, old Field of Brothers' hate and tears: Behold! yon home of Brothers' Love appears Set in the burnished silver of July, On Schuylkill wrought as in old broidery Clasped hands upon a shining baldric lie, New Hampshire, Georgia, and the mighty ten That lie between, have heard the huge-nibbed pen Of Jefferson tell the rights of man to men. They sit in the reverend Hall: Shall we declare? Floats round about the anxious-quivering air 'Twixt narrow Schuylkill and broad Delaware. Already, Land! thou hast declared: 'tis done. Ran ever clearer speech than that did run When the sweet Seven died at Lexington? Canst legibler write than Concord's large-stroked Act, Or when at Bunker Hill the clubbed guns cracked? Hast ink more true than blood, or pen than fact? Nay, as the poet mad with heavenly fires Flings men his song white-hot, then back retires, Cools heart, broods o'er the song again, inquires, Why did I this, why that? and slowly draws From Art's unconscious act Art's conscious laws; So, Freedom, writ, declares her writing's cause. All question vain, all chill foreboding vain. Adams, ablaze with faith, is hot and fain; And he, straight-fibred Soul of mighty grain, Deep-rooted Washington, afire, sereneâ Tall Bush that burns, yet keeps its substance greenâ Sends daily word, of import calm yet keen, Warm from the front of battle, till the fire Wraps opposition in and flames yet higher, And Doubt's thin tissues flash where Hope's aspire; And, Ay, declare, and ever strenuous Ay Falls from the Twelve, and Time and Nature cry Consent with kindred burnings of July; And delegate Dead from each past age and race, Viewless to man, in large procession pace Downward athwart each set and steadfast face, Responding Ay in many tongues; and lo! Manhood and Faith and Self and Love and Woe And Art and Brotherhood and Learning go Rearward the files of dead, and softly say Their saintly Ay, and softly pass away By airy exits of that ample day. Now fall the chill reactionary snows Of man's defect, and every wind that blows Keeps back the Spring of Freedom's perfect Rose. Now naked feet with crimson fleck the ways, And Heaven is stained with flags that mutinies raise, And Arnold-spotted move the creeping days. Long do the eyes that look from Heaven see Time smoke, as in the spring the mulberry tree, With buds of battles opening fitfully, Till Yorktown's winking vapors slowly fade, And Time's full top casts down a pleasant shade Where Freedom lies unarmed and unafraid. Master, ever faster fly Now the vivid seasons by; Now the glittering Western land Twins the day-lit Eastern Strand; Now white Freedom's sea-bird wing Roams the Sea of Everything; Now the freemen to and fro Bind the tyrant sand and snow, Snatching Death's hot bolt ere hurled, Flash new Life about the world, Sun the secrets of the hills, Shame the gods' slow-grinding mills, Prison Yesterday in Print, Read To-morrow's weather-hint, Haste before the halting Time, Try new virtue and new crime, Mould new faiths, devise new creeds, Run each road that frontward leads, Driven by an Onward-ache, Scorning souls that circles make. Now, O Sin! O Love's lost Shame! Burns the land with redder flame: North in line and South in line Yell the charge and spring the mine. Heartstrong South would have his way, Headstrong North hath said him nay: O strong Heart, strong Brain, beware! Hear a Song from out the air: I. âLists all white and blue in the skies; And the people hurried amain To the Tournament under the ladies' eyes Where jousted Heart and Brain. II. âBlow, herald, blow! There entered Heart, A youth in crimson and gold. Blow, herald, blow! Brain stood apart, Steel-armored, glittering, cold. III. âHeart's palfrey caracoled gayly round, Heart tra-li-raed merrily; But Brain sat still, with never a soundâ Full cynical-calm was he. IV. âHeart's helmet-crest bore favors three From his lady's white hand caught; Brain's casque was bare as Factânot he Or favor gave or sought. V. âBlow, herald, blow! Heart shot a glance To catch his lady's eye; But Brain looked straight a-front, his lance To aim more faithfully. VI. âThey charged, they struck; both fell, both bled; Brain rose again, ungloved; Heart fainting smiled, and softly said, My love to my Beloved.â Heart and Brain! no more be twain; Throb and think, one flesh again! Lo! they weep, they turn, they run; Lo! they kiss: Love, thou art one! Now the Land, with drying tears, Counts him up his flocks of years, âSee,â he says, âmy substance grows; Hundred-flocked my Herdsman goes, Hundred-flocked my Herdsman stands On the Past's broad meadow-lands, Come from where ye mildly graze, Black herds, white herds, nights and days. Drive them homeward, Herdsman Time, From the meadows of the Prime: I will feast my house, and rest. Neighbor East, come over West; Pledge me in good wine and words While I count my hundred herds, Sum the substance of my Past From the first unto the last, Chanting o'er the generous brim Cloudy memories yet more dim, Ghostly rhymes of Norsemen pale Staring by old BjÃ¶rne's sail, Strains more noble of that night Worn Columbus saw his Light, Psalms of still more heavenly tone, How the Mayflower tossed alone, Olden tale and later song Of the Patriot's love and wrong, Grandsire's ballad, nurse's hymnâ Chanting o'er the sparkling brim Till I shall from first to last Sum the substance of my Past.â Then called the Artist's God from in the sky: âThis Time shall show by dream and mystery The heart of all his matter to thine eye. Son, study stars by looking down in streams, Interpret that which is by that which seems, And tell thy dreams in words which are but dreams. I. The Master with His lucent hand Pinched up the atom hills and plains O'er all the moiety of land The ocean-bounded West contains: The dust lay dead upon the calm And mighty middle of His palm. II. And lo! He wrought full tenderly, And lo! He wrought with love and might, And lo! He wrought a thing to see Was marvel in His people's sight: He wrought His image dead and small, A nothing fashioned like an All. III. Then breathed He softly on the dead: âLive Self!âthou part, yet none, of Me; Dust for humility,â He said, âAnd my warm breath for Charity. Behold my latest work, thou Earth! The Self of Man is taking birth.â IV. Then, Land, tall Adam of the West, Thou stood'st upon the springy sod, Thy large eye ranging self-possest, Thy limbs the limbs of God's young god, Thy Passion murmuring I willâ Lord of the Lordship Good-and-Ill. V. O manful arms, of supple size To clasp a world or a waist as well! O manful eyes, to front the skies Or look much pity down on hell! O manful tongue, to work and sing, And soothe a child and dare a king! VI. O wonder! Now thou sleep'st in pain, Like as some dream thy soul did grieve: God wounds thee, heals thee whole again, And calls thee trembling to thine Eve. Wide-armed, thou dropp'st on knightly knee: Dear Love, Dear Freedom, go with me! VII. Then all the beasts before thee passedâ Beast War, Oppression, Murder, Lust, False Art, False Faith, slow skulking lastâ And out of Time's thick-rising dust Thy Lord said, âName them, tame them, Son; Nor rest, nor rest, till thou hast done.â VIII. Ah, name thou false, or tame thou wrong, At heart let no man fear for thee: Thy Past sings ever Freedom's Song, Thy Future's voice sounds wondrous free; And Freedom is more large than Crime, And Error is more small than Time. IX. Come, thou whole Self of Latter Man! Come o'er thy realm of Good-and-Ill, And do, thou Self that say'st I can, And love, thou Self that say'st I will; And prove and know Time's worst and best, Thou tall young Adam of the West! Baltimore, 1876. AT FIRST. TO CHARLOTTE CUSHMAN. My crippled sense fares bow'd along His uncompanioned way, And wronged by death pays life with wrong And I wake by night and dream by day. And the Morning seems but fatiguÃ¨d Night That hath wept his visage pale, And the healthy mark 'twixt dark and light In sickly sameness out doth fail. And the woods stare strange, and the wind is dumb, âO Wind, pray talk againâ And the Hand of the Frost spreads stark and numb As Death's on the deadened window-pane. Still dumb, thou Wind, old voluble friend? And the middle of the day is cold, And the heart of eve beats lax i' the end As a legend's climax poorly told. Oh vain the up-straining of the hands In the chamber late at night, Oh vain the complainings, the hot demands, The prayers for a sound, the tears for a sight. No word from over the starry line, No motion felt in the dark, And never a day gives ever a sign Or a dream sets seal with palpable mark. And O my God, how slight it were, How nothing, thou All! to thee, That a kiss or a whisper might fall from her Down by the way of Time to me: Or some least grace of the body of love, âMere wafture of floating-by, Mere sense of unseen smiling above, Mere hint sincere of a large blue eye, Mere dim receipt of sad delight From Nearness warm in the air, What time with the passing of the night She also passed, somehow, somewhere. Baltimore, 1876. A BALLAD OF TREES AND THE MASTER. Into the woods my Master went, Clean forspent, forspent. Into the woods my Master came, Forspent with love and shame. But the olives they were not blind to Him, The little gray leaves were kind to Him: The thorn-tree had a mind to Him When into the woods He came. Out of the woods my Master went, And He was well content. Out of the woods my Master came, Content with death and shame. When Death and Shame would woo Him last, From under the trees they drew Him last: 'Twas on a tree they slew Himâlast When out of the woods He came. Baltimore, November, 1880. A FLORIDA SUNDAY. From cold Norse caves or buccaneer Southern seas Oft come repenting tempests here to die; Bewailing old-time wrecks and robberies, They shrive to priestly pines with many a sigh, Breathe salutary balms through lank-lock'd hair Of sick men's heads, and soonâthis world outwornâ Sink into saintly heavens of stirless air, Clean from confessional. One died, this morn, And willed the world to wise Queen Tranquil: she, Sweet sovereign Lady of all souls that bide In contemplation, tames the too bright skies Like that faint agate film, far down descried, Restraining suns in sudden thoughtful eyes Which flashed but now. Blest distillation rare Of o'er-rank brightness filtered waterwise Through all the earths in heavenâthou always fair, Still virgin bride of e'er-creating thoughtâ Dream-worker, in whose dream the Future's wroughtâ Healer of hurts, free balm for bitter wrongsâ Most silent mother of all sounding songsâ Thou that dissolvest hells to make thy heavenâ Thou tempest's heir, that keep'st no tempest leavenâ But after winds' and thunders' wide mischance Dost brood, and better thine inheritanceâ Thou privacy of space, where each grave Star As in his own still chamber sits afar To meditate, yet, by thy walls unpent, Shines to his fellows o'er the firmamentâ Oh! as thou liv'st in all this sky and sea That likewise lovingly do live in thee, So melt my soul in thee, and thine in me, Divine Tranquillity! Gray Pelican, poised where yon broad shallows shine, Know'st thou, that finny foison all is mine In the bag below thy beakâyet thine, not less? For God, of His most gracious friendliness, Hath wrought that every soul, this loving morn, Into all things may be new-corporate born, And each live whole in all: I sail with thee, Thy Pelican's self is mine; yea, silver Sea, In this large moment all thy fishes, ripples, bights, Pale in-shore greens and distant blue delights, White visionary sails, long reaches fair By moon-horn'd strands that film the far-off air, Bright sparkle-revelations, secret majesties, Shells, wrecks and wealths, are mine; yea, Orange-trees, That lift your small world-systems in the light, Rich sets of round green heavens studded bright With globes of fruit that like still planets shine, Mine is your green-gold universe; yea, mine, White slender Lighthouse fainting to the eye That wait'st on yon keen cape-point wistfully, Like to some maiden spirit pausing pale, New-wing'd, yet fain to sail Above the serene Gulf to where a bridegroom soul Calls o'er the soft horizonâmine thy dole Of shut undaring wings and wan desireâ Mine, too, thy later hope and heavenly fire Of kindling expectation; yea, all sights, All sounds, that make this mornâquick flights Of pea-green paroquets 'twixt neighbor trees, Like missives and sweet morning inquiries From green to green, in greenâlive oaks' round heads, Busy with jays for thoughtsâgrays, whites and reds Of pranked woodpeckers that ne'er gossip out, But alway tap at doors and gad aboutâ Robins and mocking-birds that all day long Athwart straight sunshine weave cross-threads of song, Shuttles of musicâclouds of mosses gray That rain me rains of pleasant thoughts alway From a low sky of leavesâfaint yearning psalms Of endless metre breathing through the palms That crowd and lean and gaze from off the shore Ever for one that cometh nevermoreâ Palmettos ranked, with childish spear-points set Against no enemyârich cones that fret High roofs of temples shafted tall with pinesâ Green, grateful mangroves where the sand-beach shinesâ Long lissome coast that in and outward swerves, The grace of God made manifest in curvesâ All riches, goods and braveries never told Of earth, sun, air and heavenânow I hold Your being in my being; I am ye, And ye myself; yea, lastly, Thee, God, whom my roads all reach, howe'er they run, My Father, Friend, BelovÃ¨d, dear All-One, Thee in my soul, my soul in Thee, I feel, Self of my self. Lo, through my sense doth steal Clear cognizance of all selves and qualities, Of all existence that hath been or is, Of all strange haps that men miscall of chance, And all the works of tireless circumstance: Each borders each, like mutual sea and shore, Nor aught misfits his neighbor that's before, Nor him that's afterânay, through this still air, Out of the North come quarrels, and keen blare Of challenge by the hot-breath'd parties blown; Yet break they not this peace with alien tone, Fray not my heart, nor fright me for my land, âI hear from all-wards, allwise understand, The great bird Purpose bears me twixt her wings, And I am one with all the kinsmen things That e'er my Father fathered. Oh, to me All questions solve in this tranquillity: E'en this dark matter, once so dim, so drear, Now shines upon my spirit heavenly-clear: Thou, Father, without logic, tellest me How this divine denial true may be, âHow All's in each, yet every one of all Maintains his Self complete and several. Tampa, Florida, 1877. TO MY CLASS: ON CERTAIN FRUITS AND FLOWERS SENT ME IN SICKNESS If spicy-fringÃ©d pinks that blush and pale With passions of perfume,âif violets blue That hint of heaven with odor more than hue,â If perfect roses, each a holy Grail Wherefrom the blood of beauty doth exhale Grave raptures round,âif leaves of green as new As those fresh chaplets wove in dawn and dew By Emily when down the Athenian vale She paced, to do observance to the May, Nor dreamed of Arcite nor of Palamon,â If fruits that riped in some more riotous play Of wind and beam than stirs our temperate sun,â If these the products be of love and pain, Oft may I suffer, and you love, again. Baltimore, Christmas, 1880. ON VIOLET'S WAFERS, SENT ME WHEN I WAS ILL. Fine-tissued as her finger-tips, and white As all her thoughts; in shape like shields of prize, As if before young Violet's dreaming eyes Still blazed the two great Theban bucklers bright That swayed the random of that furious fight Where Palamon and Arcite made assize For Emily; fresh, crisp as her replies, That, not with sting, but pith, do oft invite More trial of the tongue; simple, like her, Well fitting lowlihood, yet fine as well, âThe queen's no finer; rich (though gossamer) In help to him they came to, which may tell How rich that him she'll come to; thus men see, Like Violet's self e'en Violet's wafers be. Baltimore, 1881. IRELAND. WRITTEN FOR THE ART AUTOGRAPH DURING THE IRISH FAMINE, 1880. Heartsome Ireland, winsome Ireland, Charmer of the sun and sea, Bright beguiler of old anguish, How could Famine frown on thee? As our Gulf-Stream, drawn to thee-ward, Turns him from his northward flow, And our wintry western headlands Send thee summer from their snow, Thus the main and cordial current Of our love sets over sea,â Tender, comely, valiant Ireland, Songful, soulful, sorrowful Ireland,â Streaming warm to comfort thee. Baltimore, 1880. UNDER THE CEDARCROFT CHESTNUT. Trim set in ancient sward, his manful bole Upbore his frontage largely toward the sky. We could not dream but that he had a soul: What virtue breathed from out his bravery! We gazed o'erhead: far down our deepening eyes Rained glamours from his green midsummer mass. The worth and sum of all his centuries Suffused his mighty shadow on the grass. A Presence large, a grave and steadfast Form Amid the leaves' light play and fantasy, A calmness conquered out of many a storm, A Manhood mastered by a chestnut-tree! Then, while his monarch fingers downward held The rugged burrs wherewith his state was rife, A voice of large authoritative Eld Seemed uttering quickly parables of life: How Life in truth was sharply set with ills; A kernel cased in quarrels; yea, a sphere Of stings, and hedge-hog-round of mortal quills: How most men itched to eat too soon i' the year, And took but wounds and worries for their pains, Whereas the wise withheld their patient hands, Nor plucked green pleasures till the sun and rains And seasonable ripenings burst all bands And opened wide the liberal burrs of life. There, O my Friend, beneath the chestnut bough, Gazing on thee immerged in modern strife, I framed a prayer of fervencyâthat thou, In soul and stature larger than thy kind, Still more to this strong Form might'st liken thee, Till thy whole Self in every fibre find The tranquil lordship of thy chestnut tree. Tampa, Florida, February, 1877. EVENING SONG. Look off, dear Love, across the sallow sands, And mark yon meeting of the sun and sea, How long they kiss in sight of all the lands. Ah! longer, longer, we. Now in the sea's red vintage melts the sun, As Egypt's pearl dissolved in rosy wine, And Cleopatra night drinks all. 'Tis done, Love, lay thine hand in mine. Come forth, sweet stars, and comfort heaven's heart; Glimmer, ye waves, round else unlighted sands. O night! divorce our sun and sky apart Never our lips, our hands. 1876. A SUNRISE SONG. âA Sunrise Songâ leads a group of seven short poems overlooked in earlier editions. Six of these, beginning with âOn A Palmetto,â were unrevised pencillings of late date, excepting the lines of 1866 to J. D. H. Young palmer sun, that to these shining sands Pourest thy pilgrim's tale, discoursing still Thy silver passages of sacred lands, With news of Sepulchre and Dolorous Hill, Canst thou be he that, yester-sunset warm, Purple with Paynim rage and wrack desire, Dashed ravening out of a dusty lair of Storm, Harried the west, and set the world on fire? Hast thou perchance repented, Saracen Sun? Wilt warm the world with peace and dove-desire? Or wilt thou, ere this very day be done, Blaze Saladin still, with unforgiving fire? Baltimore, 1881. ON A PALMETTO. Through all that year-scarred agony of height, Unblest of bough or bloom, to where expands His wandy circlet with his bladed bands Dividing every wind, or loud or light, To termless hymns of love and old despite, Yon tall palmetto in the twilight stands, Bare Dante of these purgatorial sands That glimmer marginal to the monstrous night. Comes him a Southwind from the scented vine, It breathes of Beatrice through all his blades, North, East or West, Guelph-wind or Ghibelline, 'Tis shredded into music down the shades; All sea-breaths, land-breaths, systol, diastol, Sway, minstrels of that grief-melodious Soul. 1880. STRUGGLE. My soul is like the oar that momently Dies in a desperate stress beneath the wave, Then glitters out again and sweeps the sea: Each second I'm new-born from some new grave. CONTROL. O Hunger, Hunger, I will harness thee And make thee harrow all my spirit's glebe. Of old the blind bard HervÃ© sang so sweet He made a wolf to plow his land. TO J. D. H. (KILLED AT SURREY C. H., OCTOBER, 1866.) Dear friend, forgive a wild lament Insanely following thy flight. I would not cumber thine ascent Nor drag thee back into the night; But the great sea-winds sigh with me, The fair-faced stars seem wrinkled, old, And I would that I might lie with thee There in the grave so cold, so cold! Grave walls are thick, I cannot see thee, And the round skies are far and steep; A-wild to quaff some cup of Lethe, Pain is proud and scorns to weep. My heart breaks if it cling about thee, And still breaks, if far from thine. O drear, drear death, to live without thee, O sad lifeâto keep thee mine. MARSH HYMNS. BETWEEN DAWN AND SUNRISE. Were silver pink, and had a soul, Which soul were shy, which shyness might A visible influence be, and roll Through heaven and earthâ'twere thou, O light. O rhapsody of the wraith of red, O blush but yet in prophecy, O sun-hint that hath overspread Sky, marsh, my soul, and yonder sail. THOU AND I. So one in heart and thought, I trow, That thou might'st press the strings and I might draw the bow And both would meet in music sweet, Thou and I, I trow. 1881. THE HARD TIMES IN ELFLAND. A STORY OF CHRISTMAS EVE. Strange that the termagant winds should scold The Christmas Eve so bitterly! But Wife, and Harry the four-year-old, Big Charley, Nimblewits, and I, Blithe as the wind was bitter, drew More frontward of the mighty fire, Where wise Newfoundland Fan foreknew The heaven that Christian dogs desireâ Stretched o'er the rug, serene and grave, Huge nose on heavy paws reclined, With never a drowning boy to save, And warmth of body and peace of mind. And, as our happy circle sat, The fire well capp'd the company: In grave debate or careless chat, A right good fellow, mingled he: He seemed as one of us to sit, And talked of things above, below, With flames more winsome than our wit, And coals that burned like love aglow. While thus our rippling discourse rolled Smooth down the channel of the night, We spoke of Time: thereat, one told A parable of the Seasons' flight. âTime was a Shepherd with four sheep. In a certain Field he long abode. He stood by the bars, and his flock bade leap One at a time to the Common Road. âAnd first there leapt, like bird on wing, A lissome Lamb that played in the air. I heard the Shepherd call him Spring: Oh, large-eyed, fresh and snowy fair âHe skipped the flowering Highway fast, Hurried the hedgerows green and white, Set maids and men a-yearning, passed The Bend, and gamboll'd out of sight. âAnd next marched forth a matron Ewe (While Time took down a bar for her), Udder'd so large 'twas much ado E'en then to clear the barrier. âFull softly shone her silken fleece What stately time she paced along: Each heartsome hoof-stroke wrought increase Of sunlight, substance, seedling, song, âIn flower, in fruit, in field, in bird, Till the great globe, rich fleck'd and pied, Like some large peach half pinkly furred, Turned to the sun a glowing side âAnd hung in the heavenly orchard, bright, None-such, complete. Then, while the Ewe Slow passed the Bend, a blur of light, The Shepherd's face in sadness grew: ââSummer!â he said, as one would say A sigh in syllables. So, in haste (For shame of Summer's long delay, Yet gazing still what way she paced), âHe summoned Autumn, slanting down The second bar. Thereover strode A Wether, fleeced in burning brown, And largely loitered down the Road. âFar as the farmers sight his shape Majestic moving o'er the way, All cry To harvest, crush the grape, And haul the corn and house the hay, âTill presently, no man can say, (So brown the woods that line that end) If yet the brown-fleeced Wether may, Or not, have passed beyond the Bend. âNow turn I towards the Shepherd: lo, An aged Ram, flapp'd, gnarly-horn'd, With bones that crackle o'er the snow, Rheum'd, wind-gall'd, rag-fleec'd, burr'd and thorn'd âTime takes the third bar off for him, He totters down the windy lane. 'Tis Winter, still: the Bend lies dim. O Lamb, would thou wouldst leap again!â Those seasons out, we talked of these: And I (with inward purpose sly To shield my purse from Christmas trees And stockings and wild robbery When Hal and Nimblewits invade My cash in Santa Claus's name) In full the hard, hard times surveyed; Denounced all waste as crime and shame; Hinted that âwasteâ might be a term Including skates, velocipedes, Kites, marbles, soldiers, towers infirm, Bows, arrows, cannon, Indian reeds, Cap-pistols, drums, mechanic toys, And all th' infernal host of horns Whereby to strenuous hells of noise Are turned the blessed Christmas morns; Thus, rousedâthose horns!âto sacred rage, I rose, forefinger high in air, When Harry cried (some war to wage), âPapa, is hard times ev'ywhere? âMaybe in Santa Claus's land It isn't hard times none at all!â Now, blessed Vision! to my hand Most pat, a marvel strange did fall. Scarce had my Harry ceased, when âLook!â He cried, leapt up in wild alarm, Ran to my Comrade, shelter took Beneath the startled mother's arm. And so was still: what time we saw A foot hang down the fireplace! Then, With painful scrambling scratched and raw, Two hands that seemed like hands of men Eased down two legs and a body through The blazing fire, and forth there came Before our wide and wondering view A figure shrinking half with shame, And half with weakness. âSir,â I said, âBut with a mien of dignity The seedy stranger raised his head: âMy friends, I'm Santa Claus,â said he. But oh, how changed! That rotund face The new moon rivall'd, pale and thin; Where once was cheek, now empty space; Whate'er stood out, did now stand in. His piteous legs scarce propped him up: His arms mere sickles seemed to be: But most o'erflowed our sorrow's cup When that we sawâor did not seeâ His belly: we remembered how It shook like a bowl of jelly fine: An earthquake could not shake it now; He had no bellyânot a sign. âYes, yes, old friends, you well may stare: I have seen better days,â he said: âBut now, with shrinkage, loss and care, Your Santa Claus scarce owns his head. âWe've had such hard, hard times this year For goblins! Never knew the like. All Elfland's mortgaged! And we fear The gnomes are just about to strike. âI once was rich, and round, and hale. The whole world called me jolly brick; But listen to a piteous tale. Young Harry,âSanta Claus is sick! â'Twas thus: a smooth-tongued railroad man Comes to my house and talks to me: âI've got,â says he, âa little plan That suits this nineteenth century. ââInstead of driving, as you do, Six reindeer slow from house to house, Let's build a Grand Trunk Railway through From here to earth's last terminus. ââWe'll touch at every chimney-top (An Elevated Track, of course), Then, as we whisk you by, you'll drop Each package down: just think, the force ââYou'll save, the time!âBesides, we'll make Our millions: look you, soon we will Compete for freightsâand then we'll take Dame Fortune's bales of good and ill ââ(Why, she's the biggest shipper, sir, That e'er did business in this world!): Then Death, that ceaseless Traveller, Shall on his rounds by us be whirled. ââWhen ghosts return to walk with men, We'll bring 'em cheap by steam, and fast: We'll run a Branch to heaven! and then We'll riot, man; for then, at last ââWe'll make with heaven a contract fair To call, each hour, from town to town, And carry the dead folks' souls up there, And bring the unborn babies down!â âThe plan seemed fair: I gave him cash, Nay, every penny I could raise. My wife e'er cried, â'Tis rash, 'tis rash:â How could I know the stock-thief's ways? âBut soon I learned full well, poor fool! My woes began, that wretched day. The President plied me like a tool. In lawyer's fees, and rights of way, âInjunctions, leases, charters, I Was meshed as in a mighty maze. The stock ran low, the talk ran high: Then quickly flamed the final blaze. âWith never an inch of trackâ'tis true! The debts were large ... the oft-told tale. The President rolled in splendor new âHe bought my silver at the sale. âYes, sold me out: we've moved away. I've had to give up everything. My reindeer, even, whom I ... pray, Excuse meâ ... here, o'er-sorrowing, Poor Santa Claus burst into tears, Then calmed again: âmy reindeer fleet, I gave them up: on foot, my dears, I now must plod through snow and sleet. âRetrenchment rules in Elfland, now; Yes, every luxury is cut off. âWhich, by the way, reminds me how I caught this dreadful hacking cough: âI cut off the tail of my Ulster furred To make young Kris a coat of state. That very night the storm occurred! Thus we become the sport of Fate. âFor I was out till after one, Surveying chimney-tops and roofs, And planning how it could be done Without my reindeers' bouncing hoofs. ââMy dear,â says Mrs. Claus, that night (A most superior woman she!) âIt never, never can be right That you, deep-sunk in poverty, ââThis year should leave your poor old bed, And trot about, bent down with toys, (There's Kris a-crying now for bread!) To give to other people's boys. ââSince you've been out, the news arrives The Elfs' Insurance Company's gone. Ah, Claus, those premiums! Now, our lives Depend on yours: thus griefs go on. ââAnd even while you're thus harassed, I do believe, if out you went, You'd go, in spite of all that's passed, To the children of that President!â âOh, Charley, Harry, Nimblewits, These eyes, that night, ne'er slept a wink. My path seemed honeycombed with pits. Naught could I do but think and think. âBut, with the day, my courage rose. Ne'er shall my boys, my boys (I cried), When Christmas morns their eyes unclose, Find empty stockings gaping wide! âThen hewed and whacked and whittled I; The wife, the girls and Kris took fire; They spun, sewed, cut,âtill by and by We made, at home, my pack entire!â (He handed me a bundle, here.) âNow, hoist me up: there, gently: quick! Dear boys, don't look for much this year: Remember, Santa Claus is sick!â Baltimore, December, 1877.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DIALECT POEMS. A FLORIDA GHOST. Down mildest shores of milk-white sand, By cape and fair Floridian bay, Twixt billowy pinesâa surf asleep on landâ And the great Gulf at play, Past far-off palms that filmed to nought, Or in and out the cunning keys That laced the land like fragile patterns wrought To edge old broideries. The sail sighed on all day for joy, The prow each pouting wave did leave All smile and song, with sheen and ripple coy, Till the dusk diver Eve Brought up from out the brimming East The oval moon, a perfect pearl. In that large lustre all our haste surceased, The sail seemed fain to furl, The silent steersman landward turned, And ship and shore set breast to breast. Under a palm wherethrough a planet burned We ate, and sank to rest. But soon from sleep's dear death (it seemed) I rose and strolled along the sea Down silver distances that faintly gleamed On to infinity. Till suddenly I paused, for lo! A shape (from whence I ne'er divined) Appeared before me, pacing to and fro, With head far down inclined. A wraith (I thought) that walks the shore To solve some old perplexity. Full heavy hung the draggled gown he wore; His hair flew all awry. He waited not (as ghosts oft use) To be dearheaven'd! and oh'd! But briskly said: âGood-evenin'; what 's the news? Consumption? After boa'd? âOr mebbe you 're intendin' of Investments? Orange-plantin'? Pine? Hotel? or Sanitarium? What above This yea'th can be your line? âSpeakin' of sanitariums, now, Jest look 'ee here, my friend: I know a little story,âwell, I swow, Wait till you hear the end! âSome year or more ago, I s'pose, I roamed from Maine to Floridy, And,âsee where them Palmettos grows? I bought that little key, âCal'latin' for to build right off A c'lossal sanitarium: Big surf! Gulf breeze! Jest death upon a cough! âI run it high, to hum! âWell, sir, I went to work in style: Bought me a steamboat, loaded it With my hotel (pyazers more 'n a mile!) Already framed and fit, âInsured 'em, fetched 'em safe around, Put up my buildin', moored my boat, Com-plete! then went to bed and slept as sound As if I 'd paid a note. âNow on that very night a squall, Cum up from some'eresâsome bad place! An' blowed an' tore an' reared an' pitched an' all, âI had to run a race âRight out o' bed from that hotel An' git to yonder risin' ground, For, 'twixt the sea that riz and rain that fell, I pooty nigh was drowned! âAn' thar I stood till mornin' cum, Right on yon little knoll of sand, Frequently wishin' I had stayed to hum Fur from this tarnal land. âWhen mornin' cum, I took a good Long look, andâwell, sir, sure 's I'm meâ That boat laid right whar that hotel had stood, And hit sailed out to sea! âNo: I'll not keep you: good-bye, friend. Don't think about it much,âpreehaps Your brain might git see-sawin', end for end, Like them asylum chaps, âFor here I walk, forevermore, A-tryin' to make it gee, How one same wind could blow my ship to shore And my hotel to sea!â Chadd's Ford, Pennsylvania, 1877. UNCLE JIM'S BAPTIST REVIVAL HYMN. BY SIDNEY AND CLIFFORD LANIER. [Not long ago a certain Georgia cotton-planter, driven to desperation by awaking each morning to find that the grass had quite outgrown the cotton overnight, and was likely to choke it, in defiance of his lazy freedmen's hoes and ploughs, set the whole State in a laugh by exclaiming to a group of fellow-sufferers: âIt's all stuff about Cincinnatus leaving the plough to go into politics for patriotism; he was just a-runnin' from grass!â This state of thingsâwhen the delicate young rootlets of the cotton are struggling against the hardier multitudes of the grass-suckersâis universally described in plantation parlance by the phrase âin the grass;â and Uncle Jim appears to have found in it so much similarity to the condition of his own (âBaptis'â) church, overrun, as it was, by the cares of this world, that he has embodied it in the refrain of a revival hymn such as the colored improvisator of the South not infrequently constructs from his daily surroundings. He has drawn all the ideas of his stanzas from the early morning phenomena of those critical weeks when the loud plantation-horn is blown before daylight, in order to rouse all hands for a long day's fight against the common enemy of cotton-planting mankind. In addition to these exegetical commentaries, the Northern reader probably needs to be informed that the phrase âpeerten upâ means substantially to spur up, and is an active form of the adjective âpeertâ (probably a corruption of pert), which is so common in the South, and which has much the signification of âsmartâ in New England, as e.g., a âpeertâ horse, in antithesis to a âsorryââi.e., poor, mean, lazy one.] Solo. âSin's rooster's crowed, Ole Mahster's riz, De sleepin'-time is pas'; Wake up dem lazy Baptissis,Chorus. âDey 's mightily in de grass, grass, Dey 's mightily in de grass. Ole Mahster 's blowed de mornin' horn, He 's blowed a powerful blas'; O Baptis' come, come hoe de corn, You 's mightily in de grass, grass, You 's mightily in de grass. De Meth'dis team 's done hitched; O fool, De day 's a-breakin' fas'; Gear up dat lean ole Baptis' mule, Dey 's mightily in de grass, grass, Dey 's mightily in de grass.

Don' gimme none o' yo' sass; Better sing one song for de Baptis' crop, Dey 's mightily in de grass, grass, Dey 's mightily in de grass.â And de ole crow croak: âDon' work, no, no;â But de fiel'-lark say, âYaas, yaas, An' I spec' you mighty glad, you debblish crow, Dat de Baptissis 's in de grass, grass, Dat de Baptissis 's in de grass!â Lord, thunder us up to de plowin'-match, Lord, peerten de hoein' fas', Yea, Lord, hab mussy on de Baptis' patch, Dey's mightily in de grass, grass, Dey's mightily in de grass. 1876. NINE FROM EIGHT. I was drivin' my two-mule waggin, With a lot o' truck for sale, Towards Macon, to git some baggin' (Which my cotton was ready to bale), And I come to a place on the side o' the pike Whar a peert little winter branch jest had throw'd The sand in a kind of a sand-bar like, And I seed, a leetle ways up the road, A man squattin' down, like a big bull-toad, On the ground, a-figgerin' thar in the sand With his finger, and motionin' with his hand, And he looked like Ellick Garry. And as I driv up, I heerd him bleat To hisself, like a lamb: âHauh? nine from eight Leaves nuthin'âand none to carry?â And Ellick's bull-cart was standin' A cross-wise of the way, And the little bull was a-expandin', Hisself on a wisp of hay. But Ellick he sat with his head bent down, A-studyin' and musin' powerfully, And his forrud was creased with a turrible frown, And he was a-wurken' appearently A 'rethmetic sum that wouldn't gee, Fur he kep' on figgerin' away in the sand With his finger, and motionin' with his hand, And I seed it was Ellick Garry. And agin I heard him softly bleat To hisself, like a lamb: âHauh? nine from eight Leaves nuthin'âand none to carry!â I woa'd my mules mighty easy (Ellick's back was towards the road And the wind hit was sorter breezy) And I got down off'n my load, And I crep' up close to Ellick's back, And I heerd him a-talkin' softly, thus: âThem figgers is got me under the hack. I caint see how to git out'n the muss, Except to jest nat'ally fail and bus'! My crap-leen calls for nine hundred and more. My counts o' sales is eight hundred and four, Of cotton for Ellick Garry. Thar 's eight, ought, four, jest like on a slate: Here 's nine and two oughtsâHauh? nine from eight Leaves nuthin'âand none to carry. âThem crap-leens, oh, them crap-leens! I giv one to Pardman and Sharks. Hit gobbled me up like snap-beans In a patch full o' old fiel'-larks. But I thought I could fool the crap-leen nice, And I hauled my cotton to Jammel and Cones. But shuh! 'fore I even had settled my price They tuck affidavy without no bones And levelled upon me fur all ther loans To the 'mount of sum nine hundred dollars or more. And sold me out clean for eight hundred and four, As sure as I'm Ellick Garry! And thar it is down all squar and straight, But I can't make it gee, fur nine from eight Leaves nuthin'âand none to carry.â Then I says âHello, here, Garry! However you star' and frown Thare 's somethin' fur you to carry, Fur you 've worked it upside down!â Then he riz and walked to his little bull-cart, And made like he neither had seen nor heerd Nor knowed that I knowed of his raskilly part, And he tried to look as if he wa'nt feared, And gathered his lines like he never keered, And he driv down the road 'bout a quarter or so, And then looked around, and I hollered âHello, Look here, Mister Ellick Garry! You may git up soon and lie down late, But you'll always find that nine from eight Leaves nuthin'âand none to carry.â Macon, Georgia, 1870. THAR 'S MORE IN THE MAN THAN THAR IS IN THE LAND. I knowed a man, which he lived in Jones, Which Jones is a county of red hills and stones, And he lived pretty much by gittin' of loans, And his mules was nuthin' but skin and bones, And his hogs was flat as his corn-bread pones, And he had 'bout a thousand acres o' land. This manâwhich his name it was also Jonesâ He swore that he 'd leave them old red hills and stones Fur he couldn't make nuthin' but yallerish cotton, And little o' that, and his fences was rotten, And what little corn he had, hit was boughten And dinged ef a livin' was in the land. And the longer he swore the madder he got, And he riz and he walked to the stable lot, And he hollered to Tom to come thar and hitch Fur to emigrate somewhar whar land was rich, And to quit raisin' cock-burrs, thistles and sich, And a wastin' ther time on the cussed land. So him and Tom they hitched up the mules, Pertestin' that folks was mighty big fools That 'ud stay in Georgy ther lifetime out, Jest scratchin' a livin' when all of 'em mought Git places in Texas whar cotton would sprout By the time you could plant it in the land. And he driv by a house whar a man named Brown Was a livin', not fur from the edge o' town, And he bantered Brown fur to buy his place, And said that bein' as money was skace, And bein' as sheriffs was hard to face, Two dollars an acre would git the land. They closed at a dollar and fifty cents, And Jones he bought him a waggin and tents, And loaded his corn, and his wimmin, and truck, And moved to Texas, which it tuck His entire pile, with the best of luck, To git thar and git him a little land. But Brown moved out on the old Jones' farm, And he rolled up his breeches and bared his arm, And he picked all the rocks from off'n the groun', And he rooted it up and he plowed it down, Then he sowed his corn and his wheat in the land. Five years glid by, and Brown, one day (Which he 'd got so fat that he wouldn't weigh), Was a settin' down, sorter lazily, To the bulliest dinner you ever see, When one o' the children jumped on his knee And says, âYan 's Jones, which you bought his land.â And thar was Jones, standin' out at the fence, And he hadn't no waggin, nor mules, nor tents, Fur he had left Texas afoot and cum To Georgy to see if he couldn't git sum Employment, and he was a lookin' as hum- Ble as ef he had never owned any land. But Brown he axed him in, and he sot Him down to his vittles smokin' hot, And when he had filled hisself and the floor Brown looked at him sharp and riz and swore That, âwhether men's land was rich or poor Thar was more in the man than thar was in the land.â Macon, Georgia, 1869. JONES'S PRIVATE ARGYMENT That air same Jones, which lived in Jones, He had this pint about him: He 'd swear with a hundred sighs and groans, That farmers must stop gittin' loans, And git along without 'em: That bankers, warehousemen, and sich Was fatt'nin' on the planter, And Tennessy was rotten-rich A-raisin' meat and corn, all which Draw'd money to Atlanta: And the only thing (says Jones) to do Is, eat no meat that 's boughten: But tear up every I, O, U, And plant all corn and swear for true To quit a-raisin' cotton! Thus spouted Jones (whar folks could hear, âAt Court and other gatherin's), And thus kep' spoutin' many a year, Proclaimin' loudly far and near Sich fiddlesticks and blatherin's. But, one all-fired sweatin' day, It happened I was hoein' My lower corn-field, which it lay 'Longside the road that runs my way Whar I can see what's goin'. And a'ter twelve o'clock had come I felt a kinder faggin', And laid myself un'neath a plum To let my dinner settle sum, When 'long come Jones's waggin, And Jones was settin' in it, so: A-readin' of a paper. His mules was goin' powerful slow, Fur he had tied the lines onto The staple of the scraper. The mules they stopped about a rod From me, and went to feedin' 'Longside the road, upon the sod, But Jones (which he had tuck a tod) Not knowin', kept a-readin'. And presently says he: âHit 's true; That Clisby's head is level. Thar 's one thing farmers all must do, To keep themselves from goin' tew Bankruptcy and the devil! âMore corn! more corn! must plant less ground, And mustn't eat what 's boughten! Next year the 'll do it: reasonin 's sound: (And, cotton will fetch 'bout a dollar a pound), Tharfore, I'll plant all cotton!â Macon, Georgia, 1870. THE POWER OF PRAYER; OR, THE FIRST STEAMBOAT UP THE ALABAMA. BY SIDNEY AND CLIFFORD LANIER. You, Dinah! Come and set me whar de ribber-roads does meet. De Lord, He made dese black-jack roots to twis' into a seat. Umph, dar! De Lord have mussy on dis blin' ole nigger's feet. It 'pear to me dis mornin' I kin smell de fust o' June.

Listen down de ribber, Dinah! Don't you hyar Somebody holl'in' âHoo, Jim, hoo?â My Sarah died las' y'ar; Is dat black angel done come back to call ole Jim f'om hyar? My stars, dat cain't be Sarah, shuh! Jes' listen, Dinah, now! What kin be comin' up dat bend, a-makin' sich a row? Fus' bellerin' like a pawin' bull, den squealin' like a sow? De Lord 'a' mussy sakes alive, jes' hear,âker-woof, ker-woofâ De Debble 's comin' round dat bend, he 's comin' shuh enuff, A-splashin' up de water wid his tail and wid his hoof! I'se pow'ful skeered; but neversomeless I ain't gwine run away: I'm gwine to stand stiff-legged for de Lord dis blessÃ¨d day. You screech, and swish de water, Satan! I 'se a gwine to pray. O hebbenly Marster, what thou willest, dat mus' be jes' so, And ef Thou hast bespoke de word, some nigger 's bound to go. Den, Lord, please take ole Jim, and lef young Dinah hyar below! 'Scuse Dinah, 'scuse her, Marster; for she 's sich a little chile, She hardly jes' begin to scramble up de homeyard stile, But dis ole traveller's feet been tired dis many a many a mile. I'se wufless as de rotten pole of las' year's fodder-stack. De rheumatiz done bit my bones; you hear 'em crack and crack? I cain'st sit down 'dout gruntin' like 'twas breakin' o' my back.

I would not proud persumeâbut I'll boldly make reques'; Sence Jacob had dat wrastlin'-match, I, too, gwine do my bes'; When Jacob got all underholt, de Lord he answered Yes! And what for waste de vittles, now, and th'ow away de bread, Jes' for to strength dese idle hands to scratch dis ole bald head? T'ink of de 'conomy, Marster, ef dis ole Jim was dead! Stop;âef I don't believe de Debble 's gone on up de stream; Jes' now he squealed down dar;âhush; dat 's a mighty weakly scream! Yas, sir, he 's gone, he 's gone;âhe snort way off, like in a dream! O glory hallelujah to de Lord dat reigns on high! De Debble 's fai'ly skeered to def, he done gone flyin' by; I know'd he couldn' stand dat pra'r, I felt my Marster nigh! You, Dinah; ain't you 'shamed, now, dat you didn' trust to grace? I heerd you thrashin' th'u' de bushes when he showed his face! You fool, you think de Debble couldn't beat you in a race? I tell you, Dinah, jes' as shuh as you is standin' dar, When folks starts prayin', answer-angels drops down th'u' de a'r. Yas, Dinah, whar 'ould you be now, jes' 'ceptin' fur dat pra'r?

      <field name="fulltext">UNREVISED EARLY POEMS. THE JACQUERIEâA FRAGMENT. CHAPTER I. Once on a time, a Dawn, all red and bright Leapt on the conquered ramparts of the Night, And flamed, one brilliant instant, on the world, Then back into the historic moat was hurled And Night was King again, for many years. âOnce on a time the Rose of Spring blushed out But Winter angrily withdrew it back Into his rough new-bursten husk, and shut The stern husk-leaves, and hid it many years. âOnce Famine tricked himself with ears of corn, And Hate strung flowers on his spikÃ¨d belt, And glum Revenge in silver lilies pranked him, And Lust put violets on his shameless front, And all minced forth o' the street like holiday folk That sally off afield on Summer morns. âOnce certain hounds that knew of many a chase, And bare great wounds of antler and of tusk That they had ta'en to give a lord some sport, âGood hounds, that would have died to give lords sportâ Were so bewrayed and kicked by these same lords That all the pack turned tooth o' the knights and bit As knights had been no better things than boars, And took revenge as bloody as a man's, Unhoundlike, sudden, hot i' the chops, and sweet. âOnce sat a falcon on a lady's wrist, Seeming to doze, with wrinkled eye-lid drawn, But dreaming hard of hoods and slaveries And of dim hungers in his heart and wings. Then, while the mistress gazed above for game, Sudden he flew into her painted face And hooked his horn-claws in her lily throat And drove his beak into her lips and eyes In fierce and hawkish kissing that did scar And mar the lady's beauty evermore. âAnd once while Chivalry stood tall and lithe And flashed his sword above the stricken eyes Of all the simple peasant-folk of France: While Thought was keen and hot and quick, And did not play, as in these later days, Like summer-lightning flickering in the west âAs little dreadful as if glow-worms lay In the cool and watery clouds and glimmered weakâ But gleamed and struck at once or oak or man, And left not space for Time to wave his wing Betwixt the instantaneous flash and stroke: While yet the needs of life were brave and fierce And did not hide their deeds behind their words, And logic came not 'twixt desire and act, And Want-and-Take was the whole Form of life: While Love had fires a-burning in his veins, And hidden Hate could flash into revenge: Ere yet young Trade was 'ware of his big thews Or dreamed that in the bolder afterdays He would hew down and bind old Chivalry And drag him to the highest height of fame And plunge him thence in the sea of still Romance To lie for aye in never-rusted mail Gleaming through quiet ripples of soft songs And sheens of old traditionary tales;â On such a time, a certain May arose From out that blue Sea that between five lands Lies like a violet midst of five large leaves, Arose from out this violet and flew on And stirred the spirits of the woods of France And smoothed the brows of moody Auvergne hills, And wrought warm sea-tints into maidens' eyes, And calmed the wordy air of market-towns With faint suggestions blown from distant buds, Until the land seemed a mere dream of land, And, in this dream-field Life sat like a dove And cooed across unto her dove-mate Death, Brooding, pathetic, by a river, lone. Oh, sharper tangs pierced through this perfumed May Strange aches sailed by with odors on the wind As when we kneel in flowers that grow on graves Of friends who died unworthy of our love. King John of France was proving such an ache In English prisons wide and fair and grand, Whose long expanses of green park and chace Did ape large liberty with such success As smiles of irony ape smiles of love. Down from the oaks of Hertford Castle park, Double with warm rose-breaths of southern Spring Came rumors, as if odors too had thorns, Sharp rumors, how the three Estates of France, Like old Three-headed Cerberus of Hell Had set upon the Duke of Normandy, Their rightful Regent, snarled in his great face, Snapped jagged teeth in inch-breadth of his throat, And blown such hot and savage breath upon him, That he had tossed great sops of royalty Unto the clamorous, three-mawed baying beast. And was not further on his way withal, And had but changed a snarl into a growl: How Arnold de Cervolles had ta'en the track That war had burned along the unhappy land, Shouting, since France is then too poor to pay The soldiers that have bloody devoir done. And since needs must, pardie! a man must eat, Arm, gentlemen! swords slice as well as knives! And so had tempted stout men from the ranks, And now was adding robbers' waste to war's, Stealing the leavings of remorseless battle, And making gaunter the gaunt bones of want: How this Cervolles (called âArch-priestâ by the mass) Through warm Provence had marched and menace made Against Pope Innocent at Avignon, And how the Pope nor ate nor drank nor slept, Through godly fear concerning his red wines. For if these knaves should sack his holy house And all the blessed casks be knocked o' the head, Horrendum! all his Holiness' drink to be Profanely guzzled down the reeking throats Of scoundrels, and inflame them on to seize The massy coffers of the Church's gold, And steal, mayhap, the carven silver shrine And all the golden crucifixes? No!â And so the holy father Pope made stir And had sent forth a legate to Cervolles, And treated with him, and made compromise, And, last, had bidden all the Arch-priest's troop To come and banquet with him in his house, Where they did wassail high by night and day And Father Pope sat at the board and carved Midst jokes that flowed full greasily, And priest and soldier trolled good songs for mass, And all the prayers the Priests made were, pray, drink, And all the oaths the Soldiers swore were, drink! Till Mirth sat like a jaunty postillon Upon the back of Time and urged him on With piquant spur, past chapel and past cross: How Charles, King of Navarre, in long duress By mandate of King John within the walls Of CrÃªvacÅur and then of strong AllÃ¨res, In faithful ward of Sir Tristan du Bois, Was now escaped, had supped with Guy Kyrec, Had now a pardon of the Regent Duke By half compulsion of a Paris mob, Had turned the people's love upon himself By smooth harangues, and now was bold to claim That France was not the Kingdom of King John, But, By our Lady, his, by right and worth, And so was plotting treason in the State, And laughing at weak Charles of Normandy. Nay, these had been like good news to the King, Were any man but bold enough to tell The King what [bitter] sayings men had made And hawked augmenting up and down the land Against the barons and great lords of France That fled from English arrows at Poictiers. Poictiers, Poictiers: this grain i' the eye of France Had swelled it to a big and bloodshot ball That looked with rage upon a world askew. Poictiers' disgrace was now but two years old, Yet so outrageous rank and full was grown That France was wholly overspread with shade, And bitter fruits lay on the untilled ground That stank and bred so foul contagious smells That not a nose in France but stood awry, Nor boor that cried not faugh! upon the air. CHAPTER II. Franciscan friar John de Rochetaillade With gentle gesture lifted up his hand And poised it high above the steady eyes Of a great crowd that thronged the market-place In fair Clermont to hear him prophesy. Midst of the crowd old Gris Grillon, the maimed. âA wretched wreck that fate had floated out From the drear storm of battle at Poictiers. A living man whose larger moiety Was dead and buried on the battle-fieldâ A grisly trunk, without or arms or legs, And scarred with hoof-cuts over cheek and brow, Lay in his wicker-cradle, smiling. âJacques,â Quoth he, âMy son, I would behold this priest That is not fat, and loves not wine, and fasts, And stills the folk with waving of his hand, And threats the knights and thunders at the Pope. Make way for Gris, ye who are whole of limb! Set me on yonder ledge, that I may see.â Forthwith a dozen horny hands reached out And lifted Gris Grillon upon the ledge, Whereon he lay and overlooked the crowd, And from the gray-grown hedges of his brows Shot forth a glance against the friar's eye That struck him like an arrow. Then the friar, With voice as low as if a maiden hummed Love-songs of Provence in a mild day-dream: âAnd when he broke the second seal, I heard The second beast say, Come and see. And then Went out another horse, and he was red. And unto him that sat thereon was given To take the peace of earth away, and set Men killing one another: and they gave To him a mighty sword.â The friar paused And pointed round the circle of sad eyes. âThere is no face of man or woman here But showeth print of the hard hoof of war. Ah, yonder leaneth limbless Gris Grillon. Friends, Gris Grillon is France. Good France; my France, Wilt never walk on glory's hills again? Wilt never work among thy vines again? Art footless and art handless evermore? âThou felon, War, I do arraign thee now Of mayhem of the four main limbs of France! Thou old red criminal, stand forth; I charge âBut O, I am too utter sorrowful To urge large accusation now. Nathless, My work to-day, is still more grievous. Hear! The stains that war hath wrought upon the land Show but as faint white flecks, if seen o' the side Of those blood-covered images that stalk Through yon cold chambers of the future, as The prophet-mood, now stealing on my soul, Reveals them, marching, marching, marching. See! There go the kings of France, in piteous file. The deadly diamonds shining in their crowns Do wound the foreheads of their Majesties And glitter through a setting of blood-gouts As if they smiled to think how men are slain By the sharp facets of the gem of power, And how the kings of men are slaves of stones. But look! The long procession of the kings Wavers and stops; the world is full of noise, The ragged peoples storm the palaces, They rave, they laugh, they thirst, they lap the stream That trickles from the regal vestments down, And, lapping, smack their heated chaps for more, And ply their daggers for it, till the kings All die and lie in a crooked sprawl of death, Ungainly, foul, and stiff as any heap Of villeins rotting on a battle-field. 'T is true, that when these things have come to pass Then never a king shall rule again in France, For every villein shall be king in France: And who hath lordship in him, whether born In hedge or silken bed, shall be a lord: And queens shall be as thick i' the land as wives, And all the maids shall maids of honor be: And high and low shall commune solemnly: And stars and stones shall have free interview. But woe is me, 'tis also piteous true That ere this gracious time shall visit France, Your graves, Beloved, shall be some centuries old, And so your children's, and their children's graves And many generationsâ. Ye, O ye Shall grieve, and ye shall grieve, and ye shall grieve. Your Life shall bend and o'er his shuttle toil, A weaver weaving at the loom of grief. Your Life shall sweat 'twixt anvil and hot forge, An armorer working at the sword of grief. Your Life shall moil i' the ground, and plant his seed, A farmer foisoning a huge crop of grief. Your Life shall chaffer in the market-place, A merchant trading in the goods of grief. Your Life shall go to battle with his bow, A soldier fighting in defence of grief. By every rudder that divides the seas, Tall Grief shall stand, the helmsman of the ship. By every wain that jolts along the roads, Stout Grief shall walk, the driver of the team. Midst every herd of cattle on the hills, Dull Grief shall lie, the herdsman of the drove. Oh Grief shall grind your bread and play your lutes And marry you and bury you. âHow else? Who's here in France, can win her people's faith And stand in front and lead the people on? Where is the Church? The Church is far too fat. Not, mark, by robust swelling of the thews, But puffed and flabby large with gross increase Of wine-fat, plague-fat, dropsy-fat. O shame, Thou Pope that cheatest God at Avignon, Thou that shouldst be the Father of the world And Regent of it whilst our God is gone; Thou that shouldst blaze with conferred majesty And smite old Lust-o'-the-Flesh so as by flame; Thou that canst turn thy key and lock Grief up Or turn thy key and unlock Heaven's Gate, Thou that shouldst be the veritable hand That Christ down-stretcheth out of heaven yet To draw up him that fainteth to His heart, Thou that shouldst bear thy fruit, yet virgin live, As she that bore a man yet sinnÃ¨d not, Thou that shouldst challenge the most special eyes Of Heaven and Earth and Hell to mark thee, since Thou shouldst be Heaven's best captain, Earth's best friend, And Hell's best enemyâfalse Pope, false Pope, The world, thy child, is sick and like to die, But thou art dinner-drowsy and cannot come: And Life is sore beset and crieth help But thou brook'st not disturbance at thy wine: And France is wild for one to lead her souls; But thou art huge and fat and laggest back Among the remnants of forsaken camps. Thou'rt not God's Pope, thou art the Devil's Pope. Thou art first Squire to that most puissant knight, Lord Satan, who thy faithful squireship long Hath watched and well shall guerdon. Ye sad souls, So faint with work ye love not, so thin-worn With miseries ye wrought not, so outraged By strokes of ill that pass th' ill-doers' heads And cleave the innocent, so desperate tired Of insult that doth day by day abuse The humblest dignity of humblest men, Ye cannot call toward the Church for help. The Church already is o'erworked with care Of its dyspeptic stomach. Ha, the Church Forgets about eternity. I had A vision of forgetfulness. O Dream Born of a dream, as yonder cloud is born Of water which is born of cloud! I thought I saw the moonlight lying large and calm Upon the unthrobbing bosom of the earth, As a great diamond glittering on a shroud. A sense of breathlessness stilled all the world. Motion stood dreaming he was changed to Rest, And Life asleep did fancy he was Death. A quick small shadow spotted the white world; Then instantly 'twas huge, and huger grew By instants till it did o'ergloom all space. I lifted up mine eyesâO thou just God! I saw a spectre with a million heads Come frantic downward through the universe, And all the mouths of it were uttering cries, Wherein was a sharp agony, and yet The cries were much like laughs: as if Pain laughed. Its myriad lips were blue, and sometimes they Closed fast and only moaned dim sounds that shaped Themselves to one word, Homeless, and the stars Did utter back the moan, and the great hills Did bellow it, and then the stars and hills Bandied the grief o' the ghost 'twixt heaven and earth. The spectre sank, and lay upon the air, And brooded, level, close upon the earth, With all the myriad heads just over me. I glanced in all the eyes and marked that some Did glitter with a flame of lunacy, And some were soft and false as feigning love, And some were blinking with hypocrisy, And some were overfilmed by sense, and some Blazed with ambition's wild, unsteady fire, And some were burnt i' the sockets black, and some Were dead as embers when the fire is out. A curious zone circled the Spectre's waist, Which seemed with strange device to symbol Time. It was a silver-gleaming thread of day Spiral about a jet-black band of night. This zone seemed ever to contract and all The frame with momentary spasms heaved In the strangling traction which did never cease. I cried unto the spectre, Time hath bound Thy body with the fibre of his hours. Then rose a multitude of mocking sounds, And some mouths spat at me and cried thou fool, And some, thou liest, and some, he dreams: and then Some hands uplifted certain bowls they bore To lips that writhed but drank with eagerness. And some played curious viols, shaped like hearts And stringed with loves, to light and ribald tunes, And other hands slit throats with knives, And others patted all the painted cheeks In reach, and others stole what others had Unseen, or boldly snatched at alien rights, And some o' the heads did vie in a foolish game Of which could hold itself the highest, and Of which one's neck was stiff the longest time. And then the sea in silence wove a veil Of mist, and breathed it upward and about, And waved and wound it softly round the world, And meshed my dream i' the vague and endless folds, And a light wind arose and blew these off, And I awoke. The many heads are priests That have forgot eternity: and Time Hath caught and bound them with a withe Into a fagot huge, to burn in hell. âNow if the priesthood put such shame upon Your cry for leadership, can better help Come out of knighthood? Lo! you smile, you boors? You villeins smile at knighthood? Now, thou France That wert the mother of fair chivalry, Unclose thine eyes, unclose thine eyes, here, see, Here stand a herd of knaves that laugh to scorn Thy gentlemen! O contumely hard, O bitterness of last disgrace, O sting That stings the coward knights of lost Poictiers! I wouldââ but now a murmur rose i' the crowd Of angry voices, and the friar leapt From where he stood to preach and pressed a path Betwixt the mass that way the voices came. CHAPTER III. Lord Raoul was riding castleward from field. At left hand rode his lady and at right His fool whom he loved better; and his bird, His fine ger-falcon best beloved of all, Sat hooded on his wrist and gently swayed To the undulating amble of the horse. Guest-knights and huntsmen and a noisy train Of loyal-stomached flatterers and their squires Clattered in retinue, and aped his pace, And timed their talk by his, and worked their eyes By intimation of his glance, with great And drilled precision. Then said the fool: â'Twas a brave flight, my lord, that last one! brave Didst note the heron once did turn about, And show a certain anger with his wing, And make as if he almost dared, not quite, To strike the falcon, ere the falcon him? A foolish damnable advisÃ¨d bird, Yon heron! What? Shall herons grapple hawks? God made the herons for the hawks to strike, And hawk and heron made he for lords' sport.â âWhat then, my honey-tonguÃ¨d Fool, that knowest God's purposes, what made he fools for?â âFor To counsel lords, my lord. Wilt hear me prove Fools' counsel better than wise men's advice?â âAye, prove it. If thy logic fail, wise fool, I'll cause two wise men whip thee soundly.â âSo: Wise men are prudent: prudent men have care For their own proper interest; therefore they Advise their own advantage, not another's. But fools are careless: careless men care not For their own proper interest; therefore they Advise their friend's advantage, not their own. Now hear the commentary, Cousin Raoul. This fool, unselfish, counsels thee, his lord, Go not through yonder square, where, as thou see'st Yon herd of villeins, crick-necked all with strain Of gazing upward, stand, and gaze, and take With open mouth and eye and ear, the quips And heresies of John de Rochetaillade.â Lord Raoul half turned him in his saddle round, And looked upon his fool and vouchsafed him What moiety of fastidious wonderment A generous nobleness could deign to give To such humility, with eye superb Where languor and surprise both showed themselves, Each deprecating t'other. âNow, dear knave, Be kind and tell meâtell me quickly, too,â Some proper reasonable ground or cause, Nay, tell me but some shadow of some cause, Nay, hint me but a thin ghost's dream of cause, (So will I thee absolve from being whipped) Why I, Lord Raoul, should turn my horse aside From riding by yon pitiful villein gang, Or ay, by God, from riding o'er their heads If so my humor serve, or through their bodies, Or miring fetlocks in their nasty brains, Or doing aught else I will in my Clermont? Do me this grace, mine Idiot.â âPlease thy Wisdom An thou dost ride through this same gang of boors, 'Tis my fool's-prophecy, some ill shall fall. Lord Raoul, yon mass of various flesh is fused And melted quite in one by white-hot words The friar speaks. Sir, sawest thou ne'er, sometimes, Thine armorer spit on iron when 'twas hot, And how the iron flung the insult back, Hissing? So this contempt now in thine eye, If it shall fall on yonder heated surface May bounce back upward. Well: and then? What then? Why, if thou cause thy folk to crop some villein's ears, So, evil falls, and a fool foretells the truth. Or if some erring crossbow-bolt should break Thine unarmed head, shot from behind a house, So, evil falls, and a fool foretells the truth.â âWell,â quoth Lord Raoul, with languid utterance, â'Tis very wellâand thou'rt a foolish fool, Nay, thou art Folly's perfect witless man, Stupidity doth madly dote on thee, And Idiocy doth fight her for thy love, Yet Silliness doth love thee best of all, And while they quarrel, snatcheth thee to her And saith Ah! 'tis my sweetest No-brains: mine! âAnd 'tis my mood to-day some ill shall fall.â And there right suddenly Lord Raoul gave rein And galloped straightway to the crowded square, âWhat time a strange light flickered in the eyes Of the calm fool, that was not folly's gleam, But more like wisdom's smile at plan well laid And end well compassed. In the noise of hoofs Secure, the fool low-muttered: âFolly's love! So: Silliness' sweetheart: no-brains: quoth my Lord. Why, how intolerable an ass is he Whom Silliness' sweetheart drives so, by the ear! Thou languid, lordly, most heart-breaking Nought! Thou bastard zero, that hast come to power, Nothing's right issue failing! Thou mere âpoohâ That Life hath uttered in some moment's pet. And then forgot she uttered thee! Thou gap In time, thou little notch in circumstance!â CHAPTER IV. Lord Raoul drew rein with all his company, And urged his horse i' the crowd, to gain fair view Of him that spoke, and stopped at last, and sat Still, underneath where Gris Grillon was laid, And heard, somewhile, with languid scornful gaze, The friar putting blame on priest and knight. But presently, as 'twere in weariness, He gazed about, and then above, and so Made mark of Gris Grillon. âSo, there, old man, Thou hast more brows than legs!â âI would,â quoth Gris âThat thou, upon a certain time I wot, Hadst had less legs and bigger brows, my Lord!â Then all the flatterers and their squires cried out Solicitous, with various voice, âGo to, Old Rogue,â or âShall I brain him, my good Lord?â Or, âSo, let me but chuck him from his perch,â Or, âSlice his tongue to piece his leg withal,â Or, âSend his eyes to look for his missing arms.â But my Lord Raoul was in the mood, to-day, Which craves suggestions simply with a view To flout them in the face, and so waved hand Backward, and stayed the on-pressing sycophants Eager to buy rich praise with bravery cheap. âI would know why,ââhe saidââthou wishedst me Less legs and bigger brows; and when?â âWouldst know? Learn then,â cried Gris Grillon and stirred himself, In a great spasm of passion mixed with pain; âAn thou hadst had more courage and less speed, Then, ah my God! then could not I have been That piteous gibe of a man thou see 'st I am. Sir, having no disease, nor any taint Nor old hereditament of sin or shame, âBut, feeling the brave bound and energy Of daring health that leaps along the veinsâ As a hart upon his river banks at morn, âSir, wild with the urgings and hot strenuous beats Of manhood's heart in this full-sinewed breast Which thou may'st even now discern is mine, âSir, full aware, each instant in each day, Of motions of great muscles, once were mine, And thrill of tense thew-knots, and stinging sense Of nerves, nice, capable and delicate: âSir, visited each hour by passions great That lack all instrument of utterance, Passion of loveâthat hath no arm to curve; Passion of speedâthat hath no limb to stretch; Yea, even that poor feeling of desire Simply to turn me from this side to that, (Which brooded on, into wild passion grows By reason of the impotence that broods) Balked of its end and unachievable Without assistance of some foreign arm, âSir, moved and thrilled like any perfect man, O, trebly moved and thrilled, since poor desires That are of small import to happy men Who easily can compass them, to me Become mere hopeless Heavens or actual Hells, âSir, strengthened so with manhood's seasoned soul, I lie in this damned cradle day and night, Still, still, so still, my Lord: less than a babe In powers but more than any man in needs; Dreaming, with open eye, of days when men Have fallen cloven through steel and bone and flesh At single strokes of thisâof that big arm Once wielded aught a mortal arm might wield, Waking a prey to any foolish gnat That wills to conquer my defenceless brow And sit thereon in triumph; hounded ever By small necessities of barest use Which, since I cannot compass them alone, Do snarl my helplessness into mine ear, Howling behind me that I have no hands, And yelping round me that I have no feet: So that my heart is stretched by tiny ills That are so much the larger that I knew In bygone days how trifling small they were: âDungeoned in wicker, strong as 'twere in stone; âFast chained with nothing, firmer than with steel; âCaptive in limb, yet free in eye and ear, Sole tenant of this puny Hell in Heaven: âAnd thisâall thisâbecause I was a man! For, in the battleâha, thou know'st, pale-face! When that the four great English horsemen bore So bloodily on thee, I leapt to front To front of theeâof theeâand fought four blades, Thinking to win thee time to snatch thy breath, And, by a rearing fore-hoof stricken down, Mine eyes, through blood, my brain, through pain, âMidst of a dim hot uproar fainting downâ Were 'ware of thee, far rearward, fleeing! Hound!â CHAPTER V. Then, as the passion of old Gris Grillon A wave swift swelling, grew to highest height And snapped a foaming consummation forth With salty hissing, came the friar through The mass. A stillness of white faces wrought A transient death on all the hands and breasts Of all the crowd, and men and women stood, One instant, fixed, as they had died upright. Then suddenly Lord Raoul rose up in selle And thrust his dagger straight upon the breast Of Gris Grillon, to pin him to the wall; But ere steel-point met flesh, tall Jacques Grillon Had leapt straight upward from the earth, and in The self-same act had whirled his bow by end With mighty whirr about his head, and struck The dagger with so featly stroke and full That blade flew up and hilt flew down, and left Lord Raoul unfriended of his weapon. Then The fool cried shrilly, âShall a knight of France Go stabbing his own cattle?â And Lord Raoul, Calm with a changing mood, sat still and called: âHere, huntsmen, 'tis my will ye seize the hind That broke my dagger, bind him to this tree And slice both ears to hair-breadth of his head, To be his bloody token of regret That he hath put them to so foul employ As catching villainous breath of strolling priests That mouth at knighthood and defile the Church.â The knife [Rest of line lost.] To place the edge [Rest of line lost.] Mary! the blood! it oozes sluggishly, Scorning to come at call of blade so base. Sathanas! He that cuts the ear has left The blade sticking at midway, for to turn And ask the Duke âif 'tis not done Thus far with nice precision,â and the Duke Leans down to see, and cries, â'tis marvellous nice, Shaved as thou wert ear-barber by profession!â Whereat one witling cries, â'tis monstrous fit, In sooth, a shaven-pated priest should have A shaven-earÃ¨d audience;â and another, âGive thanks, thou Jacques, to this most gracious Duke That rids thee of the life-long dread of loss Of thy two ears, by cropping them at once; And now henceforth full safely thou may 'st dare The powerfullest Lord in France to touch An ear of thine;â and now the knave o' the knife Seizes the handle to commence again, and saws And . . ha! Lift up thine head, O Henry! Friend! 'Tis Marie, walking midway of the street, As she had just stepped forth from out the gate Of the very, very Heaven where God is, Still glittering with the God-shine on her! Look! And there right suddenly the fool looked up And saw the crowd divided in two ranks. Raoul pale-stricken as a man that waits God's first remark when he hath died into God's sudden presence, saw the cropping knave A-pause with knife in hand, the wondering folk All straining forward with round-ringÃ¨d eyes, And Gris Grillon calm smiling while he prayed The Holy Virgin's blessing. Down the lane Betwixt the hedging bodies of the crowd, [Part of line lost.] majesty [Part of line lost.] . . a spirit pacing on the top Of springy clouds, and bore straight on toward The Duke. On him her eyes burned steadily With such gray fires of heaven-hot command As Dawn burns Night away with, and she held Her white forefinger quivering aloft At greatest arm's-length of her dainty arm, In menace sweeter than a kiss could be And terribler than sudden whispers are That come from lips unseen, in sunlit room. So with the spell of all the Powers of Sense That e'er have swayed the savagery of hot blood Raying from her whole body beautiful, She held the eyes and wills of all the crowd. Then from the numbÃ¨d hand of him that cut, The knife dropped down, and the quick fool stole in And snatched and deftly severed all the withes Unseen, and Jacques burst forth into the crowd, And then the mass completed the long breath They had forgot to draw, and surged upon The centre where the maiden stood with sound Of multitudes of blessings, and Lord Raoul Rode homeward, silent and most pale and strange, Deep-wrapt in moody fits of hot and cold. (End of Chapter V.) Macon, Georgia, 1868. SONG FOR âTHE JACQUERIE.â May the maiden, Violet-laden Out of the violet sea, Comes and hovers Over lovers, Over thee, Marie, and me, Over me and thee. Day the stately, Sunken lately Into the violet sea, Backward hovers Over lovers, Over thee, Marie, and me, Over me and thee. Night the holy, Sailing slowly Over the violet sea, Stars uncovers Over lovers, Stars for thee, Marie, and me, Stars for me and thee. Macon, Georgia, 1868. SONG FOR âTHE JACQUERIE.â BETRAYAL. The sun has kissed the violet sea, And burned the violet to a rose. O Sea! wouldst thou not better be Mere violet still? Who knows? who knows? Well hides the violet in the wood: The dead leaf wrinkles her a hood, And winter's ill is violet's good; But the bold glory of the rose, It quickly comes and quickly goesâ Red petals whirling in white snows, Ah me! The sun has burnt the rose-red sea: The rose is turned to ashes gray. O Sea, O Sea, mightst thou but be The violet thou hast been to-day! The sun is brave, the sun is bright, The sun is lord of love and light; But after him it cometh night. Dim anguish of the lonesome dark!â Once a girl's body, stiff and stark, Was laid in a tomb without a mark, Ah me! Macon, Georgia, 1868. SONG FOR âTHE JACQUERIE.â The hound was cuffed, the hound was kicked, O' the ears was cropped, o' the tail was nicked,(All.) Oo-hoo-o, howled the hound. The hound into his kennel crept; He rarely wept, he never slept. His mouth he always open kept Licking his bitter wound, The hound,(All.) U-lu-lo, howled the hound. A star upon his kennel shone That showed the hound a meat-bare bone.(All.) O hungry was the hound! The hound had but a churlish wit. He seized the bone, he crunched, he bit. âAn thou wert Master, I had slit Thy throat with a huge wound,â Quo' hound.(All.) O, angry was the hound. The star in castle-window shone, The Master lay abed, alone.(All.) Oh ho, why not? quo' hound. He leapt, he seized the throat, he tore The Master, head from neck, to floor, And rolled the head i' the kennel door, And fled and salved his wound, Good hound!(All.) U-lu-lo, howled the hound. Macon, Georgia, 1868. THE GOLDEN WEDDING OF STERLING AND SARAH LANIER, September 27, 1868. BY THE ELDEST GRANDSON. A rainbow span of fifty years, Painted upon a cloud of tears, In blue for hopes and red for fears, Finds end in a golden hour to-day. Ah, you to our childhood the legend told, âAt the end of the rainbow lies the gold,â And now in our thrilling hearts we hold The gold that never will pass away. Gold crushed from the quartz of a crystal life, Gold hammered with blows of human strife, Gold burnt in the love of man and wife, Till it is pure as the very flame: Gold that the miser will not have, Gold that is good beyond the grave, Gold that the patient and the brave Amass, neglecting praise and blame. O golden hour that caps the time Since, heart to heart like rhyme to rhyme, You stood and listened to the chime Of inner bells by spirits rung, That tinkled many a secret sweet Concerning how two souls should meet, And whispered of Time's flying feet With a most piquant silver tongue. O golden day,âa golden crown For the kingly heads that bowed not down To win a smile or 'scape a frown, Except the smile and frown of Heaven! Dear heads, still dark with raven hair; Dear hearts, still white in spite of care; Dear eyes, still black and bright and fair As any eyes to mortals given! Old parents of a restless race, You miss full many a bonny face That would have smiled a filial grace Around your Golden Wedding wine. But God is good and God is great. His will be done, if soon or late. Your dead stand happy in yon Gate And call you blessed while they shine. So, drop the tear and dry the eyes. Your rainbow glitters in the skies. Here's golden wine: young, old, arise: With cups as full as our souls, we say: âTwo Hearts, that wrought with smiles through tears This rainbow span of fifty years, Behold how true, true love appears True gold for your Golden Wedding day!â Macon, Georgia, September, 1868. STRANGE JOKES. Well: Death is a huge omnivorous Toad Grim squatting on a twilight road. He catcheth all that Circumstance Hath tossed to him. He curseth all who upward glance As lost to him. Once in a whimsey mood he sat And talked of life, in proverbs pat, To Eve in Eden,ââDeath, on Lifeââ As if he knew! And so he toadied Adam's wife There, in the dew. O dainty dew, O morning dew That gleamed in the world's first dawn, did you And the sweet grass and manful oaks Give lair and rest To him who toadwise sits and croaks His death-behest? Who fears the hungry Toad? Not I! He but unfetters me to fly. The German still, when one is dead, Cries out âDer Tod!â But, pilgrims, Christ will walk ahead And clear the road. Macon, Georgia, July, 1867. NIRVÃNA. Through seas of dreams and seas of phantasies, Through seas of solitudes and vacancies, And through my Self, the deepest of the seas, I strive to thee, NirvÃ¢na. Oh long ago the billow-flow of sense, Aroused by passion's windy vehemence, Upbore me out of depths to heights intense, But not to thee, NirvÃ¢na. By waves swept on, I learned to ride the waves. I served my masters till I made them slaves. I baffled Death by hiding in his graves, His watery graves, NirvÃ¢na. And once I clomb a mountain's stony crown And stood, and smiled no smile and frowned no frown Nor ate, nor drank, nor slept, nor faltered down, Five days and nights, NirvÃ¢na. Sunrise and noon and sunset and strange night And shadow of large clouds and faint starlight And lonesome Terror stalking round the height, I minded not, NirvÃ¢na. The silence ground my soul keen like a spear. My bare thought, whetted as a sword, cut sheer Through time and life and flesh and death, to clear My way unto NirvÃ¢na. I slew gross bodies of old ethnic hates That stirred long race-wars betwixt States and States. I stood and scorned these foolish dead debates, Calmly, calmly, NirvÃ¢na. I smote away the filmy base of Caste. I thrust through antique blood and riches vast, And all big claims of the pretentious Past That hindered my NirvÃ¢na. Then all fair types, of form and sound and hue, Up-floated round my sense and charmed anew. âI waved them back into the void blue: I love them not, NirvÃ¢na. And all outrageous ugliness of time, Excess and Blasphemy and squinting Crime Beset me, but I kept my calm sublime: I hate them not, NirvÃ¢na. High on the topmost thrilling of the surge I saw, afar, two hosts to battle urge. The widows of the victors sang a dirge, But I wept not, NirvÃ¢na. I saw two lovers sitting on a star. He kissed her lip, she kissed his battle-scar. They quarrelled soon, and went two ways, afar. O Life! I laughed, NirvÃ¢na. And never a king but had some king above, And never a law to right the wrongs of Love, And ever a fangÃ¨d snake beneath a dove, Saw I on earth, NirvÃ¢na. But I, with kingship over kings, am free. I love not, hate not: right and wrong agree: And fangs of snakes and lures of doves to me Are vain, are vain, NirvÃ¢na. So by mine inner contemplation long, By thoughts that need no speech nor oath nor song, My spirit soars above the motley throng Of days and nights, NirvÃ¢na. O Suns, O Rains, O Day and Night, O Chance, O Time besprent with seven-hued circumstance, I float above ye all into the trance That draws me nigh NirvÃ¢na. Gods of small worlds, ye little Deities Of humble Heavens under my large skies, And Governor-Spirits, all, I rise, I rise, I rise into NirvÃ¢na. The storms of Self below me rage and die. On the still bosom of mine ecstasy, A lotus on a lake of balm, I lie Forever in NirvÃ¢na. Macon, Georgia, 1869. THE RAVEN DAYS. Our hearths are gone out and our hearts are broken, And but the ghosts of homes to us remain, And ghastly eyes and hollow sighs give token From friend to friend of an unspoken pain. O Raven days, dark Raven days of sorrow, Bring to us in your whetted ivory beaks Some sign out of the far land of To-morrow, Some strip of sea-green dawn, some orange streaks. Ye float in dusky files, forever croaking. Ye chill our manhood with your dreary shade. Dumb in the dark, not even God invoking, We lie in chains, too weak to be afraid. O Raven days, dark Raven days of sorrow, Will ever any warm light come again? Will ever the lit mountains of To-morrow Begin to gleam athwart the mournful plain? Prattville, Alabama, February, 1868. BABY CHARLEY. He's fast asleep. See how, O Wife, Night's finger on the lip of life Bids whist the tongue, so prattle-rife, Of busy Baby Charley. One arm stretched backward round his head, Five little toes from out the bed Just showing, like five rosebuds red, âSo slumbers Baby Charley. Heaven-lights, I know, are beaming through Those lucent eyelids, veined with blue, That shut away from mortal view Large eyes of Baby Charley. O sweet Sleep-Angel, thronÃ¨d now On the round glory of his brow, Wave thy wing and waft my vow Breathed over Baby Charley. I vow that my heart, when death is nigh, Shall never shiver with a sigh For act of hand or tongue or eye That wronged my Baby Charley! Macon, Georgia, December, 1869. A SEA-SHORE GRAVE. To M. J. L. BY SIDNEY AND CLIFFORD LANIER. O wish that's vainer than the plash Of these wave-whimsies on the shore: âGive us a pearl to fill the gashâ God, let our dead friend live once more!â O wish that's stronger than the stroke Of yelling wave and snapping levin; âGod, lift us o'er the Last Day's smoke, All white, to Thee and her in Heaven!â O wish that's swifter than the race Of wave and wind in sea and sky; Let's take the grave-cloth from her face And fall in the grave, and kiss, and die! Look! High above a glittering calm Of sea and sky and kingly sun, She shines and smiles, and waves a palmâ And now we wishâThy will be done! Montgomery, Alabama, 1866. SOULS AND RAIN-DROPS. Light rain-drops fall and wrinkle the sea, Then vanish, and die utterly. One would not know that rain-drops fell If the round sea-wrinkles did not tell. So souls come down and wrinkle life And vanish in the flesh-sea strife. One might not know that souls had place Were't not for the wrinkles in life's face. NILSSON. A rose of perfect red, embossed With silver sheens of crystal frost, Yet warm, nor life nor fragrance lost. High passion throbbing in a sphere That Art hath wrought of diamond clear, âA great heart beating in a tear. The listening soul is full of dreams That shape the wondrous-varying themes As cries of men or plash of streams. Or noise of summer rain-drops round That patter daintily a-ground With hints of heaven in the sound. Or noble wind-tones chanting free Through morning-skies across the sea Wild hymns to some strange majesty. O, if one trope, clear-cut and keen, May type the art of Song's best queen, White-hot of soul, white-chaste of mien, On Music's heart doth Nilsson dwell As if a Swedish snow-flake fell Into a glowing flower-bell. New York, 1871. NIGHT AND DAY. The innocent, sweet Day is dead. Dark Night hath slain her in her bed. O, Moors are as fierce to kill as to wed! âPut out the light, said he. A sweeter light than ever rayed From star of heaven or eye of maid Has vanished in the unknown Shade âShe 's dead, she 's dead, said he Now, in a wild, sad after-mood The tawny Night sits still to brood Upon the dawn-time when he wooed âI would she lived, said he. Star-memories of happier times, Of loving deeds and lovers' rhymes, Throng forth in silvery pantomimes. âCome back, O Day! said he. Montgomery, Alabama, 1866. A BIRTHDAY SONG. To S. G. For ever wave, for ever float and shine Before my yearning eyes, oh! dream of mine Wherein I dreamed that time was like a vine, A creeping rose, that clomb a height of dread Out of the sea of Birth, all filled with dead, Up to the brilliant cloud of Death o'erhead. This vine bore many blossoms, which were years. Their petals, red with joy, or bleached by tears, Waved to and fro i' the winds of hopes and fears. Here all men clung, each hanging by his spray. Anon, one dropped; his neighbor 'gan to pray; And so they clung and dropped and prayed, alway. But I did mark one lately-opened bloom, Wherefrom arose a visible perfume That wrapped me in a cloud of dainty gloom. And roseâan odor by a spirit hauntedâ And drew me upward with a speed enchanted, Swift floating, by wild sea or sky undaunted, Straight through the cloud of death, where men are free. I gained a height, and stayed and bent my knee. Then glowed my cloud, and broke and unveiled thee. âO flower-born and flower-souled!â I said, âBe the year-bloom that breathed thee ever red, Nor wither, yellow, down among the dead. âMay all that cling to sprays of time, like me, Be sweetly wafted over sky and sea By rose-breaths shrining maidens like to thee!â Then while we sat upon the height afar Came twilight, like a lover late from war, With soft winds fluting to his evening star. And the shy stars grew bold and scattered gold, And chanting voices ancient secrets told, And an acclaim of angels earthward rolled. Montgomery, Alabama, October, 1866. RESURRECTION. Sometimes in morning sunlights by the river Where in the early fall long grasses wave, Light winds from over the moorland sink and shiver And sigh as if just blown across a grave. And then I pause and listen to this sighing. I look with strange eyes on the well-known stream. I hear wild birth-cries uttered by the dying. I know men waking who appear to dream. Then from the water-lilies slow uprises The still vast face of all the life I know, Changed now, and full of wonders and surprises, With fire in eyes that once were glazed with snow. Fair now the brows old Pain had erewhile wrinkled, And peace and strength about the calm mouth dwell. Clean of the ashes that Repentance sprinkled, The meek head poises like a flower-bell. All the old scars of wanton wars are vanished; And what blue bruises grappling Sense had left And sad remains of redder stains are banished, And the dim blotch of heart-committed theft. O still vast vision of transfigured features Unvisited by secret crimes or dooms, Remain, remain amid these water-creatures, Stand, shine among yon water-lily blooms. For eighteen centuries ripple down the river, And windy times the stalks of empires wave, âLet the winds come from the moor and sigh and shiver, Fain, fain am I, O Christ, to pass the grave. TO ?. The Day was dying; his breath Wavered away in a hectic gleam; And I said, if Life 's a dream, and Death And Love and all are dreamsâI'll dream. A mist came over the bay Like as a dream would over an eye. The mist was white and the dream was grey And both contained a human cry, The burthen whereof was âLove,â And it filled both mist and dream with pain, And the hills below and the skies above Were touched and uttered it back again. The mist broke: down the rift A kind ray shot from a holy star. Then my dream did waver and break and liftâ Through it, O Love, shone thy face, afar. So Boyhood sets: comes Youth, A painful night of mists and dreams; That broods till Love's exquisite truth, The star of a morn-clear manhood, beams. Boykin's Bluff, Virginia, 1863. THE WEDDING. O marriage-bells, your clamor tells Two weddings in one breath. She marries whom her love compels: âAnd I wed Goodman Death! My brain is blank, my tears are red; Listen, O God:ââI will,â he said:â And I would that I were dead. Come groomsman Grief and bridesmaid Pain Come and stand with a ghastly twain. My Bridegroom Death is come o'er the meres To wed a bride with bloody tears. Ring, ring, O bells, full merrily: Life-bells to her, death-bells to me: O Death, I am true wife to thee! Macon, Georgia, 1865. THE PALM AND THE PINE. FROM THE GERMAN OF HEINE. In the far North stands a Pine-tree, lone, Upon a wintry height; It sleeps: around it snows have thrown A covering of white. It dreams forever of a Palm That, far i' the Morning-land, Stands silent in a most sad calm Midst of the burning sand. Point Lookout Prison, 1864. SPRING GREETING. FROM THE GERMAN OF HERDER. All faintly through my soul to-day, As from a bell that far away Is tinkled by some frolic lay, Floateth a lovely chiming. Thou magic bell, to many a fell And many a winter-saddened dell Thy tongue a tale of Spring doth tell, Too passionate-sweet for rhyming. Chime out, thou little song of Spring, Float in the blue skies ravishing. Thy song-of-life a joy doth bring That 's sweet, albeit fleeting. Float on the Spring-winds e'en to my home: And when thou to a rose shalt come That hath begun to show her bloom, Say, I send her greeting! Point Lookout Prison, 1864. THE TOURNAMENT. Joust First. I. Bright shone the lists, blue bent the skies, And the knights still hurried amain To the tournament under the ladies' eyes, Where the jousters were Heart and Brain II. Flourished the trumpets: entered Heart, A youth in crimson and gold. Flourished again: Brain stood apart, Steel-armored, dark and cold. III. Heart's palfrey caracoled gayly round, Heart tra-li-ra'd merrily; But Brain sat still, with never a sound, So cynical-calm was he. IV. Heart's helmet-crest bore favors three From his lady's white hand caught; While Brain wore a plumeless casque; not he Or favor gave or sought. V. The herald blew; Heart shot a glance To find his lady's eye, But Brain gazed straight ahead his lance To aim more faithfully. VI. They charged, they struck; both fell, both bled. Brain rose again, ungloved, Heart, dying, smiled and faintly said, âMy love to my beloved!â Camp French, Wilmington, N. C., May, 1862. Joust Second. I. A-many sweet eyes wept and wept, A-many bosoms heaved again; A-many dainty dead hopes slept With yonder Heart-knight prone o' the plain. II. Yet stars will burn through any mists, And the ladies' eyes, through rains of fate, Still beamed upon the bloody lists And lit the joust of Love and Hate. III. O strange! or ere a trumpet blew, Or ere a challenge-word was given, A knight leapt down i' the lists; none knew Whether he sprang from earth or heaven. IV. His cheek was soft as a lily-bud, His grey eyes calmed his youth's alarm; Nor helm nor hauberk nor even a hood Had he to shield his life from harm. V. No falchion from his baldric swung, He wore a white rose in its place. No dagger at his girdle hung, But only an olive-branch, for grace. VI. And âCome, thou poor mistaken knight,â Cried Love, unarmed, yet dauntless there, âCome on, God pity thee!âI fight Sans sword, sans shield; yet, Hate, beware!â VII. Spurred furious Hate; he foamed at mouth, His breath was hot upon the air, His breath scorched souls, as a dry drought Withers green trees and burns them bare. VIII. Straight drives he at his enemy, His hairy hands grip lance in rest, His lance it gleams full bitterly, God!âgleams, true-point, on Love's bare breast! IX. Love's grey eyes glow with a heaven-heat, Love lifts his hand in a saintly prayer; Look! Hate hath fallen at his feet! Look! Hate hath vanished in the air! X. Then all the throng looked kind on all; Eyes yearned, lips kissed, dumb souls were freed; Two magic maids' hands lifted a pall And the dead knight, Heart, sprang on his steed. XI. Then Love cried, âBreak me his lance, each knight! Ye shall fight for blood-athirst Fame no more!â And the knights all doffed their mailÃ¨d might And dealt out dole on dole to the poor. XII. Then dove-flights sanctified the plain, And hawk and sparrow shared a nest. And the great sea opened and swallowed Pain, And out of this water-grave floated Rest! Macon, Georgia, 1865. THE DYING WORDS OF STONEWALL JACKSON. âOrder A. P. Hill to prepare for battle.â âTell Major Hawks to advance the Commissary train.â âLet us cross the river and rest in the shade.â The stars of Night contain the glittering Day And rain his glory down with sweeter grace Upon the dark World's grand, enchanted faceâ All loth to turn away. And so the Day, about to yield his breath, Utters the stars unto the listening Night, To stand for burning fare-thee-wells of light Said on the verge of death. O hero-life that lit us like the sun! O hero-words that glittered like the stars And stood and shone above the gloomy wars When the hero-life was done! The phantoms of a battle came to dwell I' the fitful vision of his dying eyesâ Yet even in battle-dreams, he sends supplies To those he loved so well. His army stands in battle-line arrayed: His couriers fly: all 's done: now God decide! âAnd not till then saw he the Other Side Or would accept the shade. Thou Land whose sun is gone, thy stars remain! Still shine the words that miniature his deeds. O thrice-beloved, where'er thy great heart bleeds, Solace hast thou for pain! Georgia, September, 1865. TO WILHELMINA. A white face, drooping, on a bending neck: A tube-rose that with heavy petal curves Her stem: a foam-bell on a wave that swerves Back from the undulating vessel's deck. From out the whitest cloud of summer steals The wildest lightning: from this face of thine Thy soul, a fire-of-heaven, warm and fine, In marvellous flashes its fair self reveals. As when one gazes from the summer sea On some far gossamer cloud, with straining eye, Fearing to see it vanish in the sky, So, floating, wandering Cloud-Soul, I watch thee. Montgomery, Alabama, 1866. WEDDING-HYMN. Thou God, whose high, eternal Love Is the only blue sky of our life, Clear all the Heaven that bends above The life-road of this man and wife. May these two lives be but one note In the world's strange-sounding harmony, Whose sacred music e'er shall float Through every discord up to Thee. As when from separate stars two beams Unite to form one tender ray: As when two sweet but shadowy dreams Explain each other in the day: So may these two dear hearts one light Emit, and each interpret each. Let an angel come and dwell to-night In this dear double-heart, and teach! Macon, Georgia, September, 1865. IN THE FOAM. Life swelleth in a whitening wave, And dasheth thee and me apart. I sweep out seaward:âbe thou brave. And reach the shore, Sweetheart. Beat back the backward-thrusting sea. Thy weak white arm his blows may thwart, Christ buffet the wild surge for thee Till thou 'rt ashore, Sweetheart. Ah, now thy face grows dim apace, And seems of yon white foam a part. Canst hear me through the water-bass, Cry: âTo the Shore, Sweetheart?â Now Christ thee soothe upon the Shore, My lissome-armed sea-Britomart. I sweep out seaward, never more To find the Shore, Sweetheart. Prattville, Alabama, December, 1867. BARNACLES. My soul is sailing through the sea, But the Past is heavy and hindereth me. The Past hath crusted cumbrous shells That hold the flesh of cold sea-mells About my soul. The huge waves wash, the high waves roll, Each barnacle clingeth and worketh dole And hindereth me from sailing! Old Past let go, and drop i' the sea Till fathomless waters cover thee! For I am living but thou art dead; Thou drawest back, I strive ahead The Day to find. Thy shells unbind! Night comes behind, I needs must hurry with the wind And trim me best for sailing. Macon, Georgia, 1867. NIGHT. Fair is the wedded reign of Night and Day. Each rules a half of earth with different sway, Exchanging kingdoms, East and West, alway. Like the round pearl that Egypt drunk in wine, The sun half sinks i' the brimming, rosy brine: The wild Night drinks all up: how her eyes shine! Now the swift sail of straining life is furled, And through the stillness of my soul is whirled The throbbing of the hearts of half the world. I hear the cries that follow Birth and Death. I hear huge Pestilence draw his vaporous breath: âBeware, prepare, or else ye die,â he saith. I hear a haggard student turn and sigh: I hear men begging Heaven to let them die: And, drowning all, a wild-eyed woman's cry. So Night takes toll of Wisdom as of Sin. The student's and the drunkard's cheek is thin: But flesh is not the prize we strive to win. Now airy swarms of fluttering dreams descend On souls, like birds on trees, and have no end. O God, from vulture-dreams my soul defend! Let fall on Her a rose-leaf rain of dreams, All passionate-sweet, as are the loving beams Of starlight on the glimmering woods and streams. Montgomery, Alabama, April, 1866. JUNE DREAMS, IN JANUARY. âSo pulse, and pulse, thou rhythmic-hearted Noon That liest, large-limbed, curved along the hills, In languid palpitation, half a-swoon With ardors and sun-loves and subtle thrills; âThrob, Beautiful! while the fervent hours exhale As kisses faint-blown from thy finger-tips Up to the sun, that turn him passion-pale And then as red as any virgin's lips. âO tender Darkness, when June-day hath ceased, âFaint Odor from the day-flower's crushing born, âDim, visible Sigh out of the mournful East That cannot see her lord again till morn: âAnd many leaves, broad-palmÃ¨d towards the sky To catch the sacred raining of star-light: And pallid petals, fain, all fain to die, Soul-stung by too keen passion of the night: âAnd short-breath'd winds, under yon gracious moon Doing mild errands for mild violets, Or carrying sighs from the red lips of June What aimless way the odor-current sets: âAnd stars, ringed glittering in whorls and bells, Or bent along the sky in looped star-sprays, Or vine-wound, with bright grapes in panicles, Or bramble-tangled in a sweetest maze, âOr lying like young lilies in a lake About the great white Lotus of the moon, Or blown and drifted, as if winds should shake Star blossoms down from silver stems too soon, âOr budding thick about full open stars, Or clambering shyly up cloud-lattices, Or trampled pale in the red path of Mars, Or trim-set in quaint gardener's fantasies: âAnd long June night-sounds crooned among the leaves, And whispered confidence of dark and green, And murmurs in old moss about old eaves, And tinklings floating over water-sheen!â Then he that wrote laid down his pen and sighed; And straightway came old Scorn and Bitterness, Like Hunnish kings out of the barbarous land, And camped upon the transient Italy That he had dreamed to blossom in his soul. âI 'll date this dream, he said; so: âGiven, these, On this, the coldest night in all the year, From this, the meanest garret in the world, In this, the greatest city in the land, To you, the richest folk this side of death, By one, the hungriest poet under heaven, âWrit while his candle sputtered in the gust, And while his last, last ember died of cold, And while the mortal ice i' the air made free Of all his bones and bit and shrunk his heart, And while soft Luxury made show to strike Her glovÃ¨d hands together and to smile What time her weary feet unconsciously Trode wheels that lifted Avarice to power, âAnd while, moreover,âO thou God, thou Godâ His worshipful sweet wife sat still, afar, Within the village whence she sent him forth Into the town to make his name and fame, Waiting, all confident and proud and calm, Till he should make for her his name and fame, WaitingâO Christ, how keen this cuts!âlarge-eyed, With Baby Charley till her husband make For her and him a poet's name and fame.â âRead me,â he cried, and rose, and stamped his foot Impatiently at Heaven, âread me this,â (Putting th' inquiry full in the face of God) âWhy can we poets dream us beauty, so, But cannot dream us bread? Why, now, can I Make, aye, create this fervid throbbing June Out of the chill, chill matter of my soul, Yet cannot make a poorest penny-loaf Out of this same chill matter, no, not one For Mary though she starved upon my breast?â And then he fell upon his couch, and sobbed, And, late, just when his heart leaned o'er The very edge of breaking, fain to fall, God sent him sleep. There came his room-fellow, Stout Dick, the painter, saw the written dream, Read, scratched his curly pate, smiled, winked, fell on The poem in big-hearted comic rage, Quick folded, thrust in envelope, addressed To him, the critic-god, that sitteth grim And giant-grisly on the stone causeway That leadeth to his magazine and fame. Him, by due mail, the little Dream of June Encountered growling, and at unawares Stole in upon his poem-battered soul So that he smiled,âthen shook his head upon't âThen growled, then smiled again, till at the last, As one that deadly sinned against his will, He writ upon the margin of the Dream A wondrous, wondrous word that in a day Did turn the fleeting song to very bread, âWhereat Dick Painter leapt, the poet wept, And Mary slept with happy drops a-gleam Upon long lashes of her serene eyes From twentieth reading of her poet's news Quick-sent, âO sweet my Sweet, to dream is power, And I can dream thee bread and dream thee wine, And I will dream thee robes and gems, dear Love, To clothe thy holy loveliness withal, And I will dream thee here to live by me, Thee and my little man thou hold'st at breast, âCome, Name, come, Fame, and kiss my Sweetheart's feet!â Georgia, 1869. THE CENTENNIAL MEDITATION OF COLUMBIA. 1776â1876. A CANTATA. From this hundred-terraced height, Sight more large with nobler light Ranges down yon towering years. Musical Annotations. Full chorus, sober, measured and yet majestic progressions of chords. Humbler smiles and lordlier tears Shine and fall, shine and fall, While old voices rise and call Yonder where the to-and-fro Weltering of my Long-Ago Moves about the moveless base Far below my resting-place. Mayflower, Mayflower, slowly hither flying, Trembling westward o'er yon balking sea, Hearts within Farewell dear England sighing, Chorus: the sea and the winds mingling their voices with human sighs. Winds without But dear in vain replying, Gray-lipp'd waves about thee shouted, crying âNo! It shall not be!â Jamestown, out of theeâ Plymouth, theeâthee, Albanyâ Winter cries, Ye freeze: away! Quartette: a meagre and despair ing minor. Fever cries, Ye burn: away! Hunger cries, Ye starve: away! Vengeance cries, Your graves shall stay! Then old Shapes and Masks of Things, Full chorus: return of the motive of the second movement, but worked up with greater fury, to the climax of the shout at the last line. Framed like Faiths or clothed like Kings Ghosts of Goods once fleshed and fair, Grown foul Bads in alien airâ War, and his most noisy lords, Tongued with lithe and poisoned swordsâ Error, Terror, Rage and Crime, All in a windy night of time Cried to me from land and sea, No! Thou shalt not be! Hark! Huguenots whispering yea in the dark, A rapid and intense whisper-chorus. Puritans answering yea in the dark! Yea like an arrow shot true to his mark, Darts through the tyrannous heart of Denial. Patience and Labor and solemn-souled Trial, Foiled, still beginning, Soiled, but not sinning, Toil through the stertorous death of the Night, Toil when wild brother-wars new-dark the Light, Toil, and forgive, and kiss o'er, and replight. Chorus of jubilation, until the appeal of the last two lines introduces a tone of doubt: it then sinks to pianissimo. Now Praise to God's oft-granted grace, Now Praise to Man's undaunted face, Despite the land, despite the sea, I was: I am: and I shall beâ How long, Good Angel, O how long? Sing me from Heaven a man's own song! Basso solo: the good Angel replies: âLong as thine Art shall love true love, Long as thy Science truth shall know, Long as thine Eagle harms no Dove, Long as thy Law by law shall grow, Long as thy God is God above, Thy brother every man below, So long, dear Land of all my love, Thy name shall shine, thy fame shall glow!â O Music, from this height of time my Word unfold: Full chorus jubilation and welcome. In thy large signals all men's hearts Man's heart behold: Mid-heaven unroll thy chords as friendly flags unfurled, And wave the world's best lover's welcome to the world.</field>
