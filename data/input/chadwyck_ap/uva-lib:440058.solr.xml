      <field name="fulltext">MY TROPHIES. My heart was breaking thenâbut the strong Soul Put bonds upon the trembler, and stood up Shaming its anguish with a scornful smile, And proudly spurning Sorrow's tearful cup. Weak one! she cried, wilt thou be so subdued? And bend abjectly thus to gilded Pride? Hast thou no wealth or worth in thy deep mines, That thou shouldst faint, this tinsel god beside? Go down, and from thy burning depths bring up The native melodies that nestle there; Set those wild prisoners free, and let them spread Their vocal pinions to the native air. Ayâsend the timid creatures out, to brave The winds that heave and plume the surging waste Of this world's deluge, where the Dove of heaven Has sought, and socks in vain, a place of rest. And some amongst the number will return With Trophies of green leaves from living trees, Whose glorious heads, with never-fading wreaths O'ertop the foam-crests of the billowy seas. And each such Trophy shall be unto thee More precious than Golconda's richest gem, And o'er thy brow shall shed a purer light Than empires' most resplendent diadem. And it shall dim the shine of yellow gold, As day's broad glory hides the feeble star; And thy name written on each radiant leaf, Shall down time's shadowy valley flash afar. Ah! thou shalt stand before the scorner then, In that effulgent light; and he shall own The majesty of the immortal wreath By thy high heart and dauntless spirit won. Then he shall feel how worthless and how base Appear the restless treasures of the mine, Beside those living gems, which shall endure To distant agesâand be always thine. My heart responded to that spirit voice, And sent its timid angels, one by one, Out o'er the world's cold billow, list'ning long To each wild echo of their native tone. My heart grew faint with watching, day by day, For the returning of the mission'd birds, While on the calm of cold indifference came Reproachful whisperings and derisive words. O there were deep and wringing agoniesâ Regret, and bitterness, and burning tears, Yet still I hopedâand lo! my wandering doves Came home triumphant after many years. And then I turned, to dazzle with my gems The eyes that once had scorned me. Holy heaven! Those eyes are dark and soulless,âAh! 'tis true The heart is ruined, and the spirit riven. The haughty soul is quenched; and in the halls Where intellect sat, proud in godlike might, The gibbering phantoms of insanity Hold hideous revel in eternal night. And where is now my triumph? Ah, Lord God! For what ignoble ends we waste our life, And thy most precious gifts, when human pride And human passions urge us to the strife! When gems that should be consecrate to Thee Are vainly offered at a mortal shrine, Till the poor idols, crumbling back to dust, Mock the weak faith which fancied it divine; And falls like charnel-dust, so cold and foul Upon the heart that madly worshipped there, And lies above its beauty and its hopes, The black corroding ashes of despair. O heavenly Father! may I now presume To lay my worthless Trophies on Thy shrine? Behold! I cast them at Thine altar's foot, And my heart with them.âFather! make them Thine! THE THREE MARY'S. They stood beside the crossâthe cruel cross, That instrument of agony and death, So dreadful, so protracted, so intense, So mingling with intolerable pain, The mad'ning thirst of fever and the weight Of weariness,âuntil the victim sends Each sobbing breath out, with a groaning prayer That God will let him die. 'Twere terrible To stand beside the cross, though on it hung The veriest fiends that ever cursed the earth With power to sin and suffer. Oh! the soul Grows faint and sick, and shrinks into itself, If bold imagination shadow forth Such scene of torment. Weak humanity Would veil such hideous picture; but the voice, The weary husky voice, struggling at times Into a piercing scream of such distress As speaks the fiercest form of agonyâ This voice is in the soul. The cross! the cross! Fond woman oft has stood beside the cross, With heart and spirit dying with the pain That wore away the life of her belov'd, Her good, her beautiful, her precious one.â They stood beside the cross,âbeneath the cross On which the object of their love, their faith, Their worship, was expiring. Many hearts Had built their faith and ardent hopes on him; Had followed as he tracked the rugged ways From city unto city;âwitnessing The deeds that proved his mission.âWhere were they? Oh coward hearts! They had not strength to be Beside the cross.âThey had not nerve to bear The sympathy of such exquisite wo;â They had not courage to acknowledge him, Who was despised, condemned, and crucified, Their Friend, their Lord, and Master. Even those Who had professed to him so earnestly: We will not be offended, or deny That we are thine, though we should die with thee,â Even these forsook him in his hour of need, And fled. One only of that craven band, The youngest, tenderest-hearted, best beloved, Stood with a heart like woman's, strong in love, Beside the cross that day. But they were there, The women, in whose bosoms earnest faith Leaned on adoring love.âNo fear of death, Of shame or pain, could keep them from his side. Devoted woman in her calendar Reads no such words, as âHide thyself for fear!ââ She cannot say, âI do not know the man,â When danger gathers round a friend she loves; But closer still she nestles to his side, And gentler flow her words, as with soft hand She seeks to lay sweet balm on every wound That malice may inflict. She cannot saveâ But she will soothe, and solace, and sustain With strength that never failsâthe strength of love. They knew that he was great; that he had pow'r To bind the viewless pinions of the wind, The free strong windâthat he had pow'r to hush The frantic billows of the stormy sea, As with calm majesty he waved his hand And uttered his commandment, âPeaceâBe stillâ That he controlled the fiercest of the fiends That torture human nature; that disease Was subject to him; that the spring of life Gushed up afresh within the silent heart, And poured its thrilling current, warm and free, Along the trembling nerves at his command. They knew that he was worthy to be feared, And knelt unto in worship. Man knew this.â But there's a holier chord in woman's heart, A quick perception of the good, the pure, The great, the spiritually beautiful, Which, with the distant homage of the soul, Blends the near worship of the ardent heartâ The heart, which asks no questions of the past, Which knows no future, never dreams of self; The present with the object it adores Is its eternity. The heart is blind, And deaf to all dictation, and doth cling Unto its love, with a tenacity Regardless of proud reason's scornful taunt, Or cold derisive smile. The heart is strong,â Its very weakness is to it a might, A strength invincible. There cannot be Of things created aught so beautiful As a true woman's fervent, faithful heart, In the devotion of its earnest love. And these all loved the sufferer with a love Warm as its fountain, as its object pure. But wherefore were they there? They had no hope That they could save the victim, or subtract One drop of bitterness from that keen cup Of mingled agony, drugged deep with death. They could not give him ease, or life, or hope; Then wherefore stood they agonizing there? The heart constrained them. They could prove at least Their love and steadfast confidence in him. The thousands upon whom he had bestowed Such precious gifts as healing to the sick, Sight to the blind, and hearing to the deaf; Strength to the feeble, to the crippled power To walk and leap for joy; to the possess'd Deliverance from their demons;âwhere were they? Ay, where was Lazarus, and the widow's son, Those whom his voice had called again from death? We see them not.âTheir faith may be as great As woman's faith,âtheir love is not so strong. The fervent-hearted Mary, kneeling there, Pressed her pale forehead on the senseless wood, And lo! there is a stain upon her brow, A blood-drop from the feet, which she did long To wash again with her warm flowing tears, And dry with the soft tresses of her hair. Which joyfully she would anoint again With precious spikenard, and the healing balm. Oh! how his words now tremble in her soul, âShe hath anointed me for burial.â Ayâall his words were written in her heart, And she had treasured them; as like a child She sat at those dear feet. Ah, she is there, The tender and the beautiful, whose soul, In its young dreams of bliss, had sought to find One worthy of its love, who would give back The wealth of its affectionâone to whom She might unveil deep feelings' holy shrine Fearless of sacrilege, whose ardent soul Could understand and answer all her thoughts; Whose nerves would thrill with hers at every touch Of joy or sorrow; one whose breast to her Should be a pillow, where no single thorn Should wound her spirit or disturb her rest. But she had chased a shadow, and had found Those isles of beauty by her fancy spread Upon the smiling ocean of delight, Cold icebergs glitt'ring to the setting sun, And floating on a frigid polar sea. And they had lured her to the very brink Of deep perdition. Then, with spirit stained, Soul outraged, heart despoiled of half its wealth, Like some young fledgeling bird, which spreads its wings To seek the bright groves of the balmy south, And meets the storm-winds of the equinox, Which toss it at their pleasure, till its plumes Are wet and ruffled, and its tender form All bruised and weary; then with drooping head, And pinions hanging listless by its sides, It sits alone in some cold darksome nook, And thinks of all the joys it left behind For wild unreal hopes. So she looked back Upon her wasted youth. Oh! mournfully Lay scattered here and there along the path, Amongst rank pois'nous weeds, the broken hopes That she had chased, and caught, and thrown aside; The withered buds, and severed leaves of flowers, That she had worn on brow and breast awhile, And thrown away with loathing. Fearful thoughts Awoke within her then, blasphemous thoughts, Of Him who had created this fair world, With all its wealth of intellectual life, And spirits longing for some real good To fill their vast capacities for bliss, For such unworthy ends; and she became Reckless, and half a maniac, and pursued The stream of bitter waters, which but mocked And tantalized her burning heart and lips, 'Till her brain maddened. Then the Crucified Met her, and pitied, and with gentle voice Reproved her wayward wanderings. Kindly then He led her to the pure and pleasant spring Of everlasting life. She knelt, and touched The living waters, and her thirst was gone, Her spirit healed, her heart made whole and pure, Her brain so calm, that she sat meekly down At her Deliverer's feet and drank his words, Until the blessed balm of holy peace Lay on her spirit, like the dew of heaven On Sharon's velvet rose. And she loved much, For she had sinned, and she had suffered much, And had been freely, lovingly forgiven.â Oh! she loved much! And therefore she was there Beside the cross, to prove that earnest love By fond devotion, fearless sympathy, And faith that wavered not. Beside her stood The Magdalen.âMagnificent of form, Of princely rank, sustained by princely wealth, Was this devoted Mary; and her mind Was capable of high and glorious things. The fire of Genius burned in her dark eye, Like the aurorean glory of the north Deep in the midnight azure of the heavens. Her brow was radiant with the august light Of living Science, and her perfect lips Were eloquent of most entrancing words, Wildering the hearer with a height, a depth, A poetry of such exalted thought As made his spirit dizzy. Still, she yearned For deeper draughts of wisdom, and resolved To drain the goblet and possess the pearl Of perfect knowledge, which for ever lies Sparkling beneath the waters. She was one To dare almighty vengeance, as did Eve To taste forbidden knowledge. All the lore Of Nature, with her many-graded life, Sentient, instinctive, intellectual, Was unto her familiar as the path O'er which she sported in her infancy. And vegetable nature was to her Like her own robe and maiden ornaments. She knew how slept the life within the germ Of seed, the most minute, a glorious life Of might and beauty, carefully enclosed In fitting envelope, and laid to sleep Perchance for years, awaiting but the touch Of quick'ning influence, to burst forth, and show Its infant loveliness.âAnd how the earth Gave substance to its form, and how it drank The gaseous spirits of the living air, And breathed the subtle light, acquiring thus The fairest forms, and most entrancing hues. She knew how fibres of peculiar form Absorbed the mineral spirits of the earth, Which, blending with the creatures of the air, Became strong powers of healing, or of death To animated things. But in her soul The tree of knowledge blossomed rank with pride, And promised fruits of power. Oh! she would climb To heaven, and range the glowing firmament, Walk the bright Zodiac, and grasp the stars, Search out their natures, analyze their fires, And find the secret influence which dwelt In each peculiar star, and how it flowed From its far fountain, to the pulsing heart Of pregnant Nature.âShe would find the powers That govern all things. She would grasp the wand Of sovereign Destiny. She would find out How life is generated; whence the soul Receives its parts and passions; how the mind Is joined to matter. She would touch the spring Which moves this vast machinery, from the globe Of this great Earth down to the atom heart Of the minutest insect. She would reach The wondrous lever which has power to move That active mystery, the human will. She would unwind the mystic chain of Fate, And penetrate the misty veil that lies O'er all the future, and survey the path Of destiny, down to the guarded gate Of the eternal bourne. She would command All spirits; she would know the height, and depth, And breadth, of all the knowledge that men deem Dark, magic, and forbidden. From height to height Her daring spirit climbed the fearful steep, Wreathing its garlands with the rarest buds That bloom in reach of the adventurous mind, Which may grasp all thingsâsave Omnipotence. But still she laid her spoils upon the shrine Of pride and human glory, while the powers And spirits of the universe obeyed Her sovereign mandate. Adding strength to strength, And wielding all the powers thus made her own, At length she wakened demons, which refused To yield obedience, or return again To their fierce element. With horror then She found herself in their infernal power Condemned to torture, and all frenzied forms Of agony, which their malevolence And vengeance could inflict. Oh! terrible Was her condition then. Yet still through all She was the Magdalen, magnificent Amid the writhings of her baffled pride, The crushing tortures of her deep despair. When those fierce demons, with their taunting eyes, Wrung all her soul to madness, and shrieked forth Their mocking laughter on the shuddering air, And told of tortures more tremendous still, Ay, past the pow'r of nature to conceive, With which they would afflict her writhing soul For ever and for ever;âwhile they mocked They feared the mighty sceptre of her power, And held her trembling, lest her peerless mind Should break their burning shackles, and avenge Itself for all its sufferings. Horrible Were her fierce strivings, and the frenzied rage Of her tormented spirit. Such was once This proud exalted woman. She had climbed Above the grade of human intellect, Above the reach of human sympathy. The soul of man did homage to her sway, And spirits bowed before her, till her pride Outgrew her power, and she became the slave Of fiends, too fierce, and fearful, for the sway Of her vast knowledge. Fearful fiends they were, And fearful were her torments. Now she stood With folded arms, and brow bent meekly down Beside the cross; and when from time to time She raised her dark wet eyes, Oh! what a light Of holy worship and adoring love Lay deep within them. Though her Saviour hung Upon that cross of torture, well she knew That he was self-devoted; that no power Of man could bind him, whom the elements Did homage to; that devils had not strength To baffle him, who by a word subdued The mighty fiends that had possessed her soul. She knew those fiends had scoffed at every power Beneath the might of the Omnipotent, And he had conquered them; not by deep spells Or incantations,âhe had merely said: Depart! and they obey'd him. Surely then He wielded the almighty power of God. And she had faith in Him, which nought on earth Or in the glorious spirit-land could shake. So she stood meekly, calmly, by the cross, With heart o'erflowing with its grateful love, And waiting with a strong expectant hope That he would triumph gloriously o'er all The powers of wicked men, of death, and hell. And there beside her, weeping on the ground In all the deep abandonment of grief, Was that same Mary, whom the angel hailed As blessed amongst women. O how far She seemed from blessed then. The dark red drops Of wringing torture, falling one by one, So heavily and slowly at her feet, Seemed each to waste the being of her soul With the dear sufferer's life. Yet there she sat, Her woman heart, with yearning tenderness, Drinking the bitterness of all the shame And agony of him she loved so much. Her mother-heart, to which his every sigh Came like the wind to the Ãolean harp, Which, stirring thrillingly the sentient string, Awakes a mournful melody of sound Which voices all its breathings. Human love! Can angels comprehend thy mysteriesâ Thy hopes, for which man perils his soul's life; The deep despair, from which he deems the grave, Ay, hell itself, a refuge! The delights Which mingle all that spirits know of bliss With human nature's thrilling ecstacies! And that word, mother! O it comprehends The all of love, the all of suffering, That thread their fibres through the universe. As if the heart maternal were a point In which all centred, and which answers back If any, even the least of all, be stirred. How throbbed that mother's heart beside the cross On which its love, its hope, its pride, its faith, Were languishing to death? A mother's hopes Are holy, and are planted by the spring Of life within her heart. Their tendrils cling Around the purest fibres of her soul, And earth has nothing great or beautiful Which they embrace not, while the topmost buds Are flashing in the radiant light of heaven. But she had hopes such as no woman's heart, Save hers, had dared to cherish. Hopes brought down By God's own angel, from the throne of truth, And planted in her heart. Hopes cherished there By blessed men and women, on whose souls The Holy Spirit shed prophetic light. She knew his being was a mystery, Accomplished by the Highest. She was sure That he was the Messiahâpromised long, And wailed for by Israel. She believed That he should âsave his people from their sins,â And sit upon his father David's throne, A glorious king for ever. She had watched The early dawning of his intellect, And knew that all within his perfect form Was holiness and beauty. She had marked The truth and wisdom of the earliest words That trembled on his lips. She had observed The earnest spirit of benevolence That shone in all his actions. She had kept Within the treasury of her mother-heart The records of his life, from that blest day In which, as she was breathing unto God The aspirations of her pure young heart, For her afflicted people, as she knelt Within her chamber, where the gathered flowers Poured out their sweet perfume, an incense meet To mingle with a pure young maiden's prayer;â O are they not alikeâthe holy flowers With breath of fragrance, and the gentle girl With voice of earnest prayer? Oh beautiful, And innocent of heart, was Mary then. The angel of the human sympathies, As yet, had never troubled the clear pool Of her affections, where the holy heavens Lay mirrored gloriously. She was all pure, Trustful, and truthful. Never yet on earth Was aught so beautiful as that fair child, As with clasped hands, and head bowed meekly down, She prayed for fallen Israel, and implored Jehovah to fulfil his prophet's words, And send the promised Saviour. Then there came A voice of softest music, and the words, âHail! highly favoured!â thrilled her startled soul. How throbbed the heart in her young bosom then, With awe, and fear, and joyful gratitude! And when she saw her son, at twelve years old, Within the temple at Jerusalem, Amongst th' assembled Doctors of the Law, Not only understanding all their words, But asking questions, with such depth of thought As made them marvelâ'twas a glorious sight For that exulting mother, her young boy Seated amongst those rev'rend white-haired men, The nation's best and wisest; his fair brow Raised with attention; his expressive eyes Beaming and flashing with the spirit's light; While his smooth cheek was eloquently flushed With the heart's throbbings, and the radiant curls, Thrown back from brow and temple, seemed a wreath Of heavenly glory, brighter than the gold That sheathed so sumptuously the sacred walls, And formed with its exquisite ornaments A background to the picture. Mary gazed Upon that beautiful and august scene, And her prophetic heart saw plainly there The Immanuel of the better covenant, Amongst the august representatives Of the old law, of cold but gorgeous forms. O, vividly appeared before her then, In those old men, so gloriously arrayed, So wise, so proud, and yet so near the grave,â The Jewish church, just verging to its fall;â While from its princely stock, a verdant branch, The purer kingdom of that holy child Should grow with fruits of peace and blessedness, Fill all the earth, and blossom up to heaven, And so endure through time and without end. And she had gazed upon him, when his form Had ripened into manhood; when he seemed A being all too pure, too beautiful, Too wise, too good, to dwell upon the earth. She saw him when he sat upon the mount, Surrounded by a mighty multitude, Who gazed and listened with astonishment, While from his lips, in glowing melody Of perfect eloquence, flowed precepts pure And beautiful as incense, wreathing up From golden censer, in the holiest place. Precepts of pietyâof humble trust And perfect faith in Godâof tenderness, Benevolence, and mercyâpurity Of heart, and word, and life. Of charity And free forgiveness of all enemies. Of love for bitter hatred, and good deeds For all malicious evil. Earnest prayer For those unhappy ones, whose souls were vexed With gnawing envy, and the torturing rage Of persecuting passions.âWhen he taught That earnest, lofty, comprehensive prayer, Gift of his love to man, which ever since Has been a daily sacrifice to God, From those who follow Jesus. Which to-day Has risen up from myriad earnest hearts, A cloud of incense, shadowing the world With fragrant blessing. Certainly that prayer, Breathed by humility, and winged with faith, Must reach the throne of heaven. For God will hear The prayer himself dictated, from the lips Of his incarnate Word, with the command, âWhen ye pray, say, Our Father.â She had seen His matchless form, surrounded by a sea Of heaving bosoms, while with word of power And touch omnipotent, he loosed the bonds Of fierce diseases, of demoniac ire, And dull infirmity; so that the sick Sprang from their beds rejoicing, the possessed Felt the return of sanctity and peace, And looked up with delighted hope to heaven. The lame stood up, and leaped, and walked, and ran, With wonder and delight. The deaf stood mute With rapture, while their grateful souls drank in The harmony of sound, and tasted first That sweetest melody, the human voice, As loved ones spake unto them joyously, And thanked the giver of such priceless gift. The dumb poured out their gratitude in words Of eloquent thanksgiving; and the blindâ How reeled their spirits, as they looked on earth, With all its forms and hues of loveliness, And majesty, and terror, in the light Of the sublime blue ocean of wide space, With its intensely glorious mariners. But 'midst those scenes of rapture, while the healed Knelt down and worshipped, or with selfish joy Hurried away exulting, while glad friends Clasped their restored with smiles, and tears, and shouts, And grateful adoration, she had seen The pale cold shrouded dead awake to life, And cling with warm affection to the breast Which swelled beneath the pressure, with a flood Of almost insupportable delight. Amid these scenes of triumph, still her eyes Dwelt with a mother's earnest love and pride Upon that beaming face, now eloquent With such compassion as he needs must feel Who knows the frailty, suffering, and wo, Of weak humanity; now lighted up With a serene authority; now raised With pleading look to heaven; now terrible With stern command; now fearful with reproof; Now bright with approbation;âbeautiful, In all beyond description, or the power Of pencil to delineate. Then she thought: O nobly wilt thou fill King David's throne, And sway the sceptre o'er a happy land, Freed by thy wisdom, by thy power sustained, And so established that it shall endure For ever.âIt was thus the angel said, âOf his dominion there shall be no end.â But now,âO now, he hung upon the cross, Between two thieves; as if malicious hate Would drug the cup of death with every pang That man can suffer. Ah! those blessed feet, To which the toilsome steeps of Judah's hills Were all familiar ways, as patiently He went from place to place, with precious gifts For an ungrateful world; those beauteous feet, Look how they quiver with the agony That wrings the nerves, from where the rugged nails Are rusting in their wounds. Those perfect hands, So rich, so liberal of their priceless wealth; Which never once withheld the precious boon From suppliant creature; which were never raised Except to scatter blessings; they are pierced, And bear upon the rough transfixing nails The languid body's weight. Are all his deeds Of mercy, all his precepts good, and wise, And loyal, quite forgotten? Does no voice In that vast concourse speak of his good deeds, His blameless life, his perfect innocence? Ah yes. The rulers hiss amongst the mob In mocking tones of gratified revenge,â âHe saved others, but himselfâhimself He cannot save.â And then they cried to him: âIf thou indeed art Christ, the Son of God, The King of Israel, come down the cross, And then we will believe.â He heeded not,â His eyes were heavenward, and his trembling lips Were full of blessings still. Oh arrogant And blind presumptuous man! If he who then Could send one prayer to heaven, which should bring down Ten legions of strong angels, prompt to act At his command, possessing will and power To execute whate'er he should require,â If he, amidst those fearful agonies, Had felt one throb of self within his heart,â That heart, which shrined within its holy depths The ruined myriads of the human race, With love so strong, so warm, so wonderful, That angels, with the highest seraphim That burn with ardent worship, still bow down Their radiant heads in wonder, and adore Love, even to them incomprehensible, Which held Immanuel on the cross that dayâ Ay, taunters! if he had indeed come down, And dashed that cup of torture from his lips, Its bitterness had overwhelmed the world With everlasting death and misery; And ye would have believed, with such belief As makes the devils tremble! He had power To save himselfâbut 'twas his will of love To save his torturers. âFather!â he cried, âforgive them; For they know not what they do.â And one poor wretch, who languished at his side, Said with derision, in the anguished tone That struggled hoarsely from his guilty breast: âIf thou be Christ, save thyself and us.â But there came no reply from that meek heart, And his poor fellow-sufferer turned his face, Ghastly with misery, and rebuked the wretch For such unseasonable levity. And then, with humble penitence and faith, He said to Jesus, âLord, remember me When thou shalt reign in glory.â Unto him There came an answer, O so full of love, So overflowing with sustaining hope,â âThou shalt be with me, certainly, to-day In Paradise.â 'Twas noontide, and the crowd Grew faint beneath the fierce meridian sun, Which aggravated to intensity The thirst and fever of the crucified. But lo! there comes a darkness o'er the earth, As if the shade of the death-angel's wing Lay heavily upon it. 'Tis high noon, And yet the sun is hidden, and the chill And blackness of deep midnight veils the world. Cold horror filled all hearts, and silent fear Lay on all spirits, like a shroud of ice, And they crouched down, expectant, and afraid Of some impending terror. Can it be That nature is expiring with the life Of him who saidâI am the Son of God? Lo! on that sullen stillness, came a voice Of most intense and bitter agony, As if a miserable universe Were gathered in one heart, and its despair Expressed by that one voice, which cried aloud: Eloi! Eloi! Lama! Sabacthani! A murmur of derision, like the hiss Of fiendish serpents, answer'd from the gloom, And all was still again. So still, so dark, It seem'd that Nature held her breath, and hid Her eyes from sight so dread. Three fearful hours This heavy darkness lasted, and despair Was gathering round all hearts her frigid pall, When from the Sufferer on the cross there came A voice so deep, so thrilling, that it seem'd To startle earth and heaven, as piercingly He utter'd: âIt is finished!â and bow'd down His mighty head in death. One short quick breath It seem'd that Nature drew, and then gave forth A groan of mortal anguish. This strong earth, Rock-built, and iron-sinew'd, groaned and shook With horrible convulsion. Fearful chasms Were open'd in her bosom. Mountain rocks Rent from their bases, with the stunning shock Of quick explosion, adding to the crash Loud detonations. Palaces and towers Shook like the summer blossoms in a storm; The glorious temple of the Holy Oneâ That august pile of marble and pure goldâ Reeled from its deep foundations, and the veil That closed the entrance of the holiest place Was rent from top to bottom, as if God Design'd no longer to conceal himself In gorgeous myst'ry of imposing forms And human workmanship. One piercing scream From man, and beast, and bird, went quivering up, Prolonging Nature's groan of agony, And then dumb silence wrapp'd the world again. The bold centurion of the Roman guard, Who watch'd the sufferers on the cross that day, Gave his confession to the listening world, And thus proclaim'd his faith: Most certainly, This was the Son of God. O Mary, of the warm and tender heart! How seem'd thy very soul to melt in tears, As o'er this scene of sorrow, and the wreck Of an astonished world, the sun look'd out, And show'd that glorious form droop'd heavily, The bright eyes dim, the perfect features fix'd And seal'd with Death's cold signet. But her love Is undiminished. He was innocent; He spake the words, and work'd the works of God; Heaven has attested it, and earth has borne Audible evidence that he was true And worthy of heart-worship. That cold form Should be embalm'd with cost and pious care, And honourably buried. And his name Should live for ever. While the soul endures, His deeds should be remember'd,âand his words Are graven on the altar-piece of Truth, And shall not be forgotten while the sun And earth remain, or while intelligence Is bodied in quick matter. Shame nor death Could conquer in that trusting woman's heart The strong devotion of adoring love, Which dwelt with Memory on the blessed past, And walk'd with Hope a bright futurity Of blessed and eternal intercourse And holy worship in the spirit-land, Where sin and death come not. Can tongue express The mother's sufferings in those fearful hours Of darkness, death, and horror? Now indeed The sword pass'd through her soul. Where was her faith, Her hope for erring Israel? They had thrown Their Saviour from them. They had crucified Their King, who would have saved them from their sins And from oppression. They had cast away Healing and honour, freedom, and the meed Of an eternal kingdom. Now their fate Was seal'd. They had rejected and despised The King, whose coming they had look'd for long, And now they were undone. With broken heart She bow'd her head. She knew that God is wise And merciful, but Israel was undone;â Her Son is crucifiedâshe hopes no more. But Magdalen, her strong and trusting soul Clings to its cherish'd hopes. She knew, she knew That He was the Immanuel, who should live And reign for ever. Heaven, in blackness veil'd, Earth, groaning and convulsed, bear evidence Of His divinity. She feels assured That this is not the sequel, and looks up To greet a glorious future. Magdalen! Strong was thy faith and great was its reward! When drawn by faith and love at early morn Into the garden of the sepulchre, First of the sisterhood who came with myrrh And all embalming spices to preserve That form so dearly lovedâthe risen Lord, In all the glory of immortal life, But half reveal'd in morning's misty light, Stood near thee, and inquired: âWhy weepest thou? Whom seekest thou?â Then, to thine earnest plea: âIf thou hast borne him hence, O tell me where He lies, and I will take him now away;â He merely answer'd: âMary!â in that tone So well remembered, and so dearly loved. O what a thrill of deep ecstatic joy Pervaded all thy being, and burst forth In that one word, Rabboni! Then thy soul Was fill'd with blissful triumphs. Christ, the Lord, Had conquer'd allâeven the cold still powers Of shadowy Hades and the sepulchre. Thou seest thy Lord triumphant, and thy soul Drinks in the mystery of Almighty love, The incarnation of th' eternal Word, Why he was born, why he had lived, and died. The book of prophecy is open now, It is thy Lord of whom Isaiah sang: âHe was despised, rejected, intimate With grief and sorrow. We hid as 'twere Our faces from him. Surely he hath borne Our bitter grief, and carried in his heart Our heaviest sorrows; yet we blindly deem'd That God had smitten and afflicted him. For our transgressions he was wounded thus; These bruises are for our iniquities; On him was the chastisement of our peace; And by his cruel stripes our wounds are healed.â Yes, Mary, thou wert healed, thy soul was well, And full of joy and glory. Magdalen! Thy name became thee well. Magnificent Thou wast in mind and person, and thy fame Shall live throughout all ages. Ay, as long As ransom'd souls adore th' Incarnate God. Woman! There is a lesson for thee here; Come now and let us scan it narrowly. Our hearts are form'd for reverence, for love, For hope, and strong confiding; and in these We find our bliss, our honour, and our fame. Our beauty perishes, our brightest gifts Of genius but endure a little while; At best, no longer than the hearts we love May cherish our remembrance. Wisdom's lore And all the wealth of learning is to us A glittering and uneasy coronet, Which keeps our temples from their longed-for rest, And tempts the shaft of envy, and the pangs Of venomous detraction; and too oft Infects the heart with prideâa dire disease, Which mildews all its beauty, all its worth, And ends in shame and ruin. If our soul Be strong and stern, to battle and endure, And we attain the height, and write our name On Fame's bright altar, lo! the wither'd flowers Of feminine affection, and the buds Of tenderness and beauty, that were crush'd By our ambition, droop their mournful heads, And half conceal the record of our name And high achievements. Love, and love alone, The humble, fervent love, which of itself Is purity, and faith, and truth, and hope, And strong enduranceâthis is woman's worth, Her happiness, her fame, in earth and heaven. It was not gold, or beauty, or the gems Of intellectual riches, or the lore Of treasured learning, or the magic might Of mystic scienceâit was none of these, And Mary Magdalen possess'd them all, Which won her favour, happiness, or fame. 'Twas warm devoted love, and ardent faith, Which filled her being full of happiness, Which won for her the favour of the Lord, Which brought her earliest to the sepulchre, And made her with her sisters, living gems On the black waste of man's depravity. Which made their name a beautiful relief Upon the record of the direst deed That sin has goaded man to perpetrate. That through all ages, while the faltering tongue Of man or angel shall recount, or read, The story of the fearful sacrifice That made atonement for a world of sin, Their name shall mingle in the mournful strain Its tone of sweetly soothing melody. Yes, woman's love is the alone bright spot In all that horrid story. Woman's loveâ The soul of her religionâthe deep life Of faith and hope within her;âthis it was, With its sustaining strength and holy zeal, Which bound these blessed Mary's to their Lord; Which made them follow him from place to place, Like angels, ministering to all his wants; Which kept them agonizing at his cross, And led them early to the sepulchre; Which gave them first to greet a risen God, And taste the purest, most exalted joy, That ever trembled through the human heart; And wrote their name upon a glorious page, To live as long as God himself endures. THE LORD'S PRAYER. Our Father, God who art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy name; Thy kingdom come; thy will be done, In heaven and earth the same. Give us this day our daily bread; And oh! forgive our sins, As every one who injures us A ready pardon wins. Oh! do not lead us in the paths In which temptations lie; And when beset with evil, still Be thy deliv'rance nigh. Thine is the kingdom; heaven and earth With all their hosts are thine; Who should oppose thy sovereign sway, Or at thy deeds repine? Thine is the power, and we rejoice, All goodness as thou art, That thou hast power in earth, and heaven, And o'er the treacherous heart. Thine is the glory! Worlds on worlds Through all the depth of space, With their uncounted forms of life Are vocal in thy praise. Thine is the glory! angels sing In high and rapturous strain, Thine is the glory! we reply, For ever more.âAmen. VOICE OF THE LORD. âThe voice of the Lord shaketh the wilderness.â Psalm xxix. 8. God speaketh in the wilderness. His voice Is ever audible in the lone bowers Of this old giant forest. Even now I hear it, with a low and solemn tone Of breezy melody, moving the boughs And lifting up the foliage, which appears Like myriad wings, all fluttering with delight That God should talk with them. The summer flowers That grow beneath upon the mossy banks, Incline their heads and worship; while the birds, Waked by the holy breathing, dress their plumes, And lifting up their shining heads, reply In strains of perfect rapture. Oh! how sweet That balmy voice, that living breath of life, As soft it bathes the aching upraised brow, And whispers peace. The anguished soul is soothed, Earth, sense, and sin, and sorrow are forgot, As that pure breathing stirs the spirit's lyre To holy converse with Divinity. God speaketh in the wilderness at eve, What time the moon looks down with radiant brow, And every leaf that catches her sweet smile Grows brilliant with delight. While dell and bower Beneath are wrapped in shadow, and the brook Steals silently along, save where it meets Her bright eye peeping through the emerald screen; When, dimpling with delight, it gives her back Her radiant smile, and with a silvery tone Of joyous greeting, dances gaily on. Hark! a majestic sound fills earth and heaven; All Nature listens with deep reverence, Silent and motionless. The Lord has made Of the dark waters and thick clouds of heaven His glorious pavilion. Beautiful The silvery summits tower, in glittering piles From the green bosom of the clustering wood. Oh! what a gush of light,âas if the Lord Waved his bright hand and bade the earth attend: Then bursts again that awe-inspiring voice, Shouting, I am! and there is none beside. All nature hears and trembles; every voice Is silent now, and every heart is faint, While God rides forth upon the cherubim, Winged with the winds, along the sounding sky. The white moon veils her face, and the bright stars Hide from his presence. Earth wraps o'er her breast Her darkest mantle, and with trembling awe Awaits his rushing chariot. Lo, he comes! His voice in the loud thunder and wild winds Shaking the wilderness. The tall trees bow In graceful adoration. Hark! That crash! His finger touched a tall pine on the hill, And it was broken. The firm wood is riven, And thrown in splints like arrows through the shade. The birds cower closer in their leafy screens; The wild deer bound in terror from the spot, And crouch down in the thicket. Earth, and air, And winds, and waters,âall are echoing now The august voice of the eternal God:â Let finite man be silent. GOD IS HERE. Where the spring-flower peeps, With dew diadem crown'd, And the little rill creeps, With its silvery sound; Where the young grass appears, And the white lambs play, And the child of few years Delights to stray; Where song-birds are fluttering, With notes sweet and clear, Soft voices seem uttering, God is here! When the storm-spirit springs From the dark northern caves, And spreads his wild wings O'er the land and the waves; When the forests bow down As he passes by; When, afraid of his frown, The billows fly; When thunders are uttering Their voices of fear, Deep echoes seem muttering, God is here! Where the rough mountain glows In the summer sun sheen, Or the clear river flows Through its valley of green; Where the healthful breeze Waves the pliant grain, Or sports with the trees Along the plain; Where cattle are lowing, And flocks sporting near, Each soft sound is echoing, God is here! Where the hurricane raves Round the rock's shatter'd crest, And the pine foliage waves Round the strong eagle's nest; Where, with joyous leap And stunning sound, Down the fearful steep Wild waters bound; Dread spirits supernal, With voices of fear, Are shouting eternally, God is here! The young beautiful heart, In its innocent mirth, Ere it learneth the art Or the sorrow of earth; When light from above Bathes the buds of hope, And the blooms of love Untarnished ope; Sees earth all loveliness, All hearts sincere, And cries in its blessedness, God is here! To the soul that has known Every sorrow and ill, That is joyless and lone, Stricken, blighted, and chill; That sees joy a shade, And all earth's flowers Frail things that will fade In stormy hours; Sweetly the voice of grace Sounds in that ear, Come to the hiding-place, God is here! The spirit that feels All its errors forgiven, To which Jesus reveals The pure glories of heaven; Though it feels the warm glow Of life depart, And the blood creep slow Through the bursting heart; Even in that agony, Knoweth no fear, But crieth exultingly, God is here! RUTH. âThy God shall be my God!â Strong was the faith Of that young Moabitess, who forsook Her native country and her father's house For Israel's God. There is no spot on earth Where sunshine is so bright, the dew so pure, The grass so green, the summer flowers so sweet, The birds so blithe, as in our native land. Beside our father's hearthstone gushes up The only spring of human tenderness In which the heart can bathe without a fear Of falsehood, treachery, or forgetfulness. But Ruth had heard of God. She could not stay Where men bow down to demons; so she broke All her heart's idols, and went trembling forth, Poor, and a widow, to a stranger land, To seek the living God. No dream of love, Of wealth, or fame, allured her. Meek of heart Was that fair gentle creature, who went forth To be a gleaner in the field of him With whom she should find grace. Well didst thou prove, Thou young devoted proselyte to God, That he is a rewarder of all those That diligently seek him. Couldst thou then, While gleaning barley o'er the stubble-field, Have look'd beyond the impenetrable mist That hides the vista of futurity From our presumptuous vision, thou hadst seen Love, wealth, and princely honours waiting thee; And thy descendants, an illustrious line Of kings and princes, reaching down to Him, Of whose dominion there shall be no end, And thy name written for posterity, And honoured to the latest hour of time. TO A LOCK OF HAIR. Oh, bright brown curl! Twining in silken rings, so soft and bright, Thou bringst fond memories of a gentle girl, Like passing spirits in a summer night. Oh, she was fair, My beautiful companion, all day long; I loved her hazel eye, her shining hair, And lips that breathed the incense of sweet song. Ay, now I see The summer flush upon her cheeks of pearls, As resting 'neath the old familiar tree, She threw aside the rich dishevelled curls. And then the breeze, That kisses all the beautiful of earth, Forgot its converse with the whispering trees, And touched the living rings with tender mirth. Full many a scene Of childish happiness is present now, The blossom'd orchard and the hillside green, Where sweet wild jessamine bound the laurel bough. The limpid brook, In which we laved our little feet so oft, While o'er our heads the willow branches shook, 'Neath feather'd bills, with love-notes wild and soft. The chamber neat, Where my red cheek press'd hers so pure and fair, And while her breathing made my slumber sweet, Those dark curls mingled with my sunny hair. Oh, precious curl! Cherished memento of the blessed past, How far from those dear scenes, and that fair girl, Sever'd and rest alike our lot is cast! Oh, never more On her fair temple shalt thou rest again; Alas! the weary years, in passing o'er, Have bow'd that graceful head with care and pain. Thou wouldst not be At home, amid the thin and white-streak'd hair, Which now is comb'd so smooth and carefully, And bound beneath such cap as widows wear. Nor should I find My home amid those scenes to memory dear, For time, and change, and death, have all combined To render all those places cold and drear. How desolate Would be the weary lot of such as me, Far from a blessed home, and doom'd by fate To wrestle with a bitter destiny; But for the faith That points us to a home beyond the tomb, Where mildews never canker love's bright wreath, And youth and purity for ever bloom. A holy home, Where those who sought the footprints of the Lord, Along the paths of pain, and care, and gloom, Shall find the rest of heaven a rich reward. MUSINGS. This morning, oh! how glorious was the scene In this old wintry forest. Every tree All sheathed in lucid ice, and feathered o'er With the inimitably fibred frost. Along the swelling hills the forest lay, Like groups of glittering angels that await The bidding of Jehovah, silent all, And still, save as the morning wind came by And touched the branches, giving to the groups A lifelike motion, as of waving wings. The sun arose, and then the orient clouds Grew crimson with his glory, and their hue Touched first the summits of the plumy hills, With delicate beauty, melting slowly down Into the valleys, while a crown of gold Fell on the summits, like a wreathen work Of most amazing splendour. Every height Was then a monarch, with its diadem, And robe of kingly purple. Then a shower Of glory, like innumerable gems, Descended suddenly, and every spray All robed with jewels, ruby, diamond, Beryl, and amethyst, and hyacinth, Braided with golden chains, and strings of pearl, Seemed worth an empire. But the sun grew high, The frost-work melted, the bright hues were gone, Yet still the glory stayed. One might have deemed That the innumerable stars of heaven Had wearied of the fields of azure light, And congregated in the wilderness, To crown the old gray trees with majesty, That well might lure the angel messengers Who trace the bright paths of the zodiac To turn aside, and linger o'er a scene So like a universe in miniature, A glorious illusion. But the rays That gave those ice-gems all their brilliancy Dissolved them into tears, and long e'er noon The panorama wept itself away; And the old forest from its tresses gray Shook the last big cold drops. Such unto me Has been the dream of life. At early morn The world was full of angels, and arrayed In lustre pure as heaven. Where'er I turned, The glittering groups were waiting, with closed wings, As if they had no wish to leave a world So well adapted to their purity. But reason dawned; and fancy caught her light And threw it on the landscape; then appeared The glittering pageantry of fairy land, In all its changing beauty: forms of heaven Arrayed in all the glorious hues of earth, Crowned and adorned with gems, moving in light, 'Mid bowers and arches, wreathed and studded o'er With flowers and foliage of bright gold and gems. The fairy pageant passed; but high romance Retained the dazzling splendours, and displayed All heaven's rich hosts, wreathed into coronets, And plumes, and sceptres, for the hand and brow Of Genius; which despises all earth's gifts, And claims its meed from heaven. Oh! high, and bright, And full of glory, were life's visions then. Her friendships, loves, and joys seemed all so pure, That I believed the angels might mistake This world for their own bright and holy home. But reason's sun grew high; and long e'er noon The glories faded, and the radiant gems Were melted by their own intensity, And all dissolved to tears. Now, life to me Is like this naked wintry wilderness, Joyless, and cold, and traversed by wild winds, Which waken strange and dreamy melodies, And sigh themselves away. AWAKE! THOU THAT SLEEPEST. Sleeper, awake! Beneath thy pillow Lie serpents coiled, with deadly fangs, While o'er the deep and sullen billow, On the cliff's edge, thy bower hangs. Sleeper, awake! The blossoms round thee Breathe venom with their rich perfume, And poisoned thorns to pierce and wound thee, Beset the stalk of every bloom. A deathful darkness gathers o'er thee, Life-chilling dews around thee weep, Voices from earth and heaven implore thee, To rouse thee from this fatal sleep. Sleeper! The hurricane is coming; The serpents' fangs are near thy brow; The giant waves come swelling, foaming; Death waits! Oh, sleeper! waken now. TO THE âWEEKLY MESSENGER.â On receiving the first number (1836). Welcome to the weary breast, Messenger of Peace, Bidding care's wild billows rest, And worldly sorrows ceaseâ Bidding bleeding hearts like mine, Seek the balsam from above; Bearing from the Fount Divine, Messenger of Love. This poor heart has fondly clung To many an earthly joy, Then with bitter anguish wrung, Mourned o'er the broken toy. I have watch'd the budding flower, And fondly hoped to see it blow, But the storm, the frost, or shower, Has ever laid it low. I have lent a willing car To Hope's delusive strain: And shed full many a bitter tear, To find her promise vain. I have sought perennial flow'rs Along life's painful thorny way; And mourned beneath the rifled bow'rs To see them fall away. I have learn'd what restless things Earth's joys and treasures are; Seen them spread their phantom wings, And vanish into air. All the love and joys of earth Are like the bubbles on the stream; All its honour, fame, and mirth, The meteor's flitting gleam. Welcome! then, fair Messenger, Of more substantial bliss; Pointing to a holier And happier world than this; Speak thy Message near and far, That Christ will give the weary rest; Show the beams of Bethlehem's Star, To the benighted breast. THE SPIRIT OF POESY. A seraph of the highest heaven, Who dared to touch forbidden fire, An exile from her home was driven, Bereft of all, except her lyre. Amongst the spheres she wander'd long, And sought to join the hymns they pour, But wept to find her lyre unstrung, And chording with such strains no more. Yet dearly cherish'd was that lyre, For though its loftiest chords were riven, And strangely bright its fitful fire, 'Twas all she now retain'd of heaven. Thus all through space the lost one roved, With half seraphic changeful strain, And eyes raised tow'rd that home of love, To which she might not turn again. Her bitter tears fell on the strings, And quench'd in part their fervent fire; Then sweetly plaintive murmurings Came trembling from the angel lyre. Weary and sad she came to earth, And pleased the seraph was to find, Amongst the souls of lower birth, Some traces of the seraph mind; Some spirits wrapp'd in mortal clay, That seem'd close kindred to her lyre, Who madden'd at her fitful lay, And kindled with her ardent fire. O'er these she spread her flashing wings, And catching the ecstatic flame, Wild, ardent, inconsistent things, Her restless votaries they became. Enchain'd to earth by pow'rful ties, Round its frail loves they fondly twined, And wailed that holy sympathy Dwells not in man's imperfect mind. Unfit for heaven, unfit for earth, The wand'ring spirit's tuneful train Have ever scorned their mortal birth, And sought immortal bliss in vain. Wo! that this spirit ever came To spread her mania o'er our mind; That her impassion'd, fitful flame Should e'er have touch'd the human kind. That we, who are enchain'd to earth, Should hope to clasp celestial love, And madly ask of mortal birth The bliss that only lives above. Should feel our kindred with the fire That thrills the pure seraphic train, And hope to tune an earth-strung lyre In chorus with that perfect strain. Then disappointed, sad, and lone, Heart-wrung, and weeping o'er the strings, Pour forth in broken, sobbing tone, Our deep, despairing murmurings. Wo! that the seraph exile came With flashing wing and madd'ning glance;â Ah, wo! that Poesy's meteor flame Should wrap a mortal in its trance. CHILD OF SORROW. Child of sorrow!âChild of sorrow,â Murmur not beneath the rod, There may be a joyful morrow Treasured up for thee with God. When thy night of pain is darkest, When thy path is cold and drear, Trust in GodâHe surely marketh Every pang and every tear. If thy spirit bow before Him, With a heartfelt, humble prayer, If thy fervent faith adore Him, He will banish thy despair. He will teach thee resignation, He will give thee heartfelt peace, Blessed hope, and consolation, Riches and immortal bliss. THE SPIRIT OF BEAUTY. The spirit of beauty is all abroad, Earth feels her influence bright, And heaven is filled with a radiant flood Of melody, love, and light. She lives in the eye of the simplest flower That lifts its white hands to heaven, She hallows the mountain eagle's bower In the old pine, lightning riven. She smiles in the sleepy eye of morn, In the noonday flood of light; And the cluster'd diamonds, meekly worn, By the still and holy night. She is felt in the breeze that awakes the day, With garlands of dewy flowers, She is heard in the zephyrs that love to play In the fragrant twilight bowers. The spirit of beauty is every whereâ In the ocean-anthem's swell, In the song of the brooklet, cool and clear, That lives in the shadow'd dell. She tinges the feathery clouds that swim On the sunset ethereal sea, Like plumes from the wings of the cherubim, That flit through immensity. She sitteth sublime on the thunder's throne, While Nature bends down in awe; Her music is blent with the august tone Of the elements' glorious war. She lies in her splendour divinely bright In the rainbow's jewell'd form, Like the crown of the Glorious, shadow'd in light, On the wing of the passing storm. The spirit of beauty is all abroad, And her wings are bathed in love, And life's wild harp, by her breathing stirr'd, Pours forth a hymn to her glorious Lord, The Immortal, in beauty above. QUEEN MARY'S MUSINGS. When will the morning dawn? And yet to me What can avail the dawning? Desolate, Deserted, and bereft of every stay; Victim of falsehood, treachery, and fraud, With many a bitter pain and bitterer wo, I pass my weary hours. Year after year Creeps by these cold stone walls, and brings no change, Except a deeper curtain of dark green Around the mossy arch and ivied tower. For me there is no hope. When in the spring Jehovah writes on every hill and plain, In colours bright and balmy, fresh from heaven, His promises of plenty, wealth, and joy, Which glad the very lowliest heart that reads, With gratitude and hopeâay, even the slave Hath hope, and liberty to walk abroad, And feel the beauty and the balm of spring; But Iâwho, by the right men call divine, Am mistress of a kingdomâI, whose heart Should feel the glow of a whole nation's hopes, And garner up its joysâI, who should be Free as the wind on my own mountain-tops, And every where at home in freemen's hearts, Am lingering here, an outcast from my own; A captive in the toils of treachery; Deserted by the people whom I love, Betray'd by those on whom I lean'd for aid; Heart-wrung, insulted, tortured, with all wrongs That treachery marshals on her catalogue When she would break the heart. Tears! burning tears! Wellâlet them flow,âthere are none here to mock The agony of fallen majesty. Oh, there is balm in tears. How sweet they gush From out the fountain of the swollen heart, Relieving it, and dropping like soft rain Upon the weary spirit, as it lies Crush'd down and wounded, like a trampled flower, Which ne'er shall raise its jewell'd head again, Or shake the dust from off its velvet robes, On which the careless passer sets his foot, While he adores a far inferior bloom, Which sits in pride on her imperial stem, And scorns her injured sister. Oh, that sleep Would lay her hand upon my weary eyes, And shut this dark world out, that I might dwell A little while with loving memories, Unhaunted by the never-ceasing knell Of death, and pain, and sorrow! Give me back The vine-encumber'd hills of sunny France, Where simple gatherers of the purple grapes Made labour pleasant with their joyful songs Of liberty and love. Oh give me back The royal halls, where sweeping tapestries Of purple velvets and rich azure silks Outvied the splendour of the Fleur de lis, Beneath the shade of which my girlhood pass'd, So like a dream of Eden, with its wreaths Of voiced and living flowers, that drink the dews And wear the radiance of celestial love. Then, hundreds of brave hearts throbb'd quick and high For MaryâDauphiness of royal France, Queen of fair Scotland, and apparent heir To England's diadem;âa hundred swords Leapt flashing from their scabbards at the name Of Scotland's Mary,âand high chivalry Sought for no richer altar under heaven, On which to pour his blood, than Mary's cause. Fairest of all the fair, was Mary then, Empress of every elegance and grace That gems a lady's chaplet. Then my breast Lock'd in its treasury the noble heart Of my young kingly Francis. Let me feel Once more the throbbings of that truthful heart Amongst my life-strings, thrilling them to bliss,â The perfect bliss of young and holy love, That lies upon the spirit as the dew Of heaven lies trembling on the fragrant heart Of summer's velvet rose, which locks it in, Folding around it all her loveliness, Her softness, and her glory. Give me back The bliss of one glad morning, when all France Pour'd one united pÃ¦an; when her hills, And vales, and streams, and cities, all were glad, And crown'd with bridal garlands; when the souls Of all the people were alive with joy; When even sorrow put aside her veil, And watch'd the general gladness with a smile; The myriad-hearted city felt one tide Of rapture, moving every sentient pulse; But her proud heartâthe palace of her kingsâ Was all alive with joy. In one young breast Lived deep and still the spring of all the bliss That flooded this broad land. I was a brideâ The love that was my life was crown'd and blest; I was a royal brideâand earth had nought That I had cause to covet. All was heaven, Around, above, within me. Was there one Who would have augur'd from that glorious morn A day of mourning, blackness, and despair, Captivity and shame? Ah! now they comeâ The dark and adverse days,âa mournful train, Hurrying along to strange discordant sounds, Woven with death-knells, groans, and taunting words, Into a horrid march. My spirit shrinks From these appalling spectres as they pass. Oh! here are agonies that well might wring The warrior's heart of iron, till red blood Gush'd from the bursting portal. Every ill That woman's heart has known since time began, Has fallen upon mine. The loneliness Of infant orphanage, when the young eye Turns tearful from the cold unloving gaze Of guardian and domestic; while the soul Is yearning for that dew of blessednessâ A mother's soothing love. Young widowhood, With its wild, sobbing grief, and long, lone nights, And dark and cheerless mornings. Truthfully I wept my young heart's lord, upon whose tomb Lay reft and broken my fair coronet Of royal lilies. I had lost my love, My royal husband, and the crown of France. Oh doubly, trebly, was my soul bereaved! Oh, Francis! if thy Mary could have died, And fill'd one grave with thee. That first keen grief! Oh, it was but a drop, one little drop, Compared with the wide ocean, to the wo That I have since endured. Wave after wave Has dash'd upon my spirit; I have drain'd That keenest of all cupsâingratitude, Embittered by the heaviest injuriesâ Hatred, and wrong, and scorn, and vile abuse From those I loved and trusted. I have been The poor neglected wife, who weeps by night, While memory repeats fond words of love, Sweet promises, and softly-whisper'd hopes, That were all breathed in vain, and then thrown back, With bitter scorn, upon the wither'd heart Which gave them as rich treasures. Oh how thick The groups of misery gather! Let me hide From those dark, treacherous, and accusing eyes; Vindictively they lour on every side, With mutterings of vile things, the very thought Of which is ignominy. Oh, great Lord! Thou know'st I never did such horrid things As they accuse me of. I am a queen, Too proud to do dishonourable deeds, Too conscious of the dignity of kings, To stain th' escutcheon of a royal race. And yet I am a woman, warm of heart, Of kind, forgiving nature. I have been In some things weak, in many things abused, In all misrepresented. Above all, Betray'd and made a captive, and detained In bold defiance of the sacred laws Of faith and honour. Vile hypocrisy Of mine oppressor! How can woman's heart Be such a tissue of unlovely thoughts Towards a hapless sister? Could our fates Have been reversed, the Lord of mercy knows That Queen Elizabeth had never lain A prisoner all these years in Mary's realm. Oh, no! I would have raised the drooping head, And soothed the troubled spirit. It had been My bliss to have restored to her her rights. How can Elizabeth, the strong, the wise, The noble-hearted, manly-spirited, Allow base jealousy and low revenge To tarnish thus the lustre of her name?â A name which through all time must stand alone, Last on the record of a noble race Of kings, and queens, and mighty conquerors, That with her death becomes extinct. The thought That Mary has a son, on whom the eyes Of England rest in hope, adds bitterness To all the hatred which she lavishes On my devoted head. Yet if she knew How like a burning coal deep in my heart Lies even that holy word,âMaternity,â Her barren breast perchance would feel a joy In having poison'd thus the sweetest spring Of human happiness. Oh deep and keen My quivering soul has felt the barbed shaft Of cruel treatment from a cherish'd child, For whom I would at any time have died. His youthful brain was poisoned by the streams That gush'd from the foul bosoms of my foes, And, falling constantly upon his heart, Have petrified the chords of filial love, So that his eye and voice are icy cold, And his car callous. Oh 'tis agony To feel that he has power to break these chains And punish mine oppressors, while I groan And cry for aid in vain. My son! my son! How is it possible that thy young heart Could heed the whispers of malevolence, And close against thy mother, unto whom Thou art sole hope and pride? It is for thee That I endure this long captivity, And wear a crown, to me all valueless; Guarding its rights with most religious care; That of its honours, not a single leaf Should wither, or be wanting when it lies Upon my coffin, thence to be transferr'd To shed its glories on thy royal brow, Which yet shall wear proud England's diadem. God grant that crowns sit easier on thy brow Than mine. The thistle and the rose Compose the wreath, and I have worn the thorns All next my bleeding brow. Yet be assured That I have rifled it of no one gem, Nor shalt thou find a stain upon its gold, Except it be my blood. Hark! The dull chime Peals out the matin hour. To my wrung heart There is a soothing in the solemn chime, Which falls like holy dew upon my soul. How sweet the soothing that religion brings In her rich offices. The holy church Hath not cast off her daughter. Still she gives Peace, hope, and consolation, and her hand Lifts the dark scenery of the stage of life, And points me to the glories of that world In which the weary find eternal rest. The world is false. Its honours and its wealth Are snares and burdens to the weary soul; And human loveâoh! what a fading flower!â Its beauty and its fragrance pass away, But never fail to leave the venom'd thorns Within the bleeding bosom. Loyalty!â What is it, but a fawning sycophant That follows power, and worships at the feet Of popularity! And friendship, too,â The holiest of the human sympathies, Is fickle, and a traitor unto me;â And my own child,âhe, whom I fondly bore Upon my bosom, and against my heart,â He leaves me to the malice of my foes, And I must die! But I will die a queen, A martyr, and a Christian. I have hope,â A strong, sustaining hope,âwhich stands sublime Upon the wreck of empire, fame, and life, In hearing of the symphonies of heaven, And, catching the entrancing melody, Repeats the soothing numbers, which sink down Into my spirit like the summer dew Upon the fainting flower. It fills my soul With peace and consolation. Gracious Lord! I bow before thee, and, with humbled heart, Say, âAll THY WILL BE DONE.â TO THE âHARTFORD COLUMBIAN.â Thou comest as the carrier-dove, That seeks the exile's lonely cell, Awaking shades of hope and love That Memory knows too well. Ay, now before my spirit rise Rough summits, crested with green trees, Whence nature's holy melodies Float out upon the breeze, Which lingers on the green hill's breast, To play at billows with the grain; Then fondly whispering, breaks the rest Of flowers upon the plain. Dear land, on which the radiance bright Of childhood's blessed memory lies, Which gilds all objects with the light Of its own laughing eyes;â Dear land of my nativity! Sweet home of innocence and love! Earth hath no spot which unto me So dear a home can prove. Ah! now I see thy broad bright stream;â Has earth another stream so bright? How free and pure those waters seem, Beneath the lunar light. Oh! many a time, by that clear ray, I watched upon thy noble tide, The gallant vessel on her way To ocean, dark and wide: And thought of Oriental lands, With all their fabled joys and loves, Where rivers sleep on golden sands, Beneath the orange groves. And then I idly wished to roam By fairy isle, and South Sea strand; But nowâoh! give me back my home, I ask no fairer land. Oh! give me back New England's hills, Her meadows, and enamelled vales, Her rivers, and her living rills, Snow wreaths and wintry gales. Oh! give me back the holy hush Of Sabbath 'neath New England's sky, Where e'en the breeze and fountain's gush Speak low and reverently. Oh! let me hear the Sabbath bells, Peal forth the solemn call to prayer; Where pure devotion's anthem swells, Oh! let me worship there. It may not beâit may not beâ Land of tried hearts and truthful lore, The daughter who so longs for thee, Shall breathe thine air no more. My home, thy noble stream beside, Is filled with stranger voices now, My own sweet flowers are wreathed in pride Upon a stranger's brow. And those who made that home so blest Are scattered from its haunts away, Some to a home of perfect rest, Beyond life's chequered way: And some, like me, to other lands, More fair perhaps, but oh! less dear;â Oh, home! though midst the deserts sands, Thou hast thine exile's tear. We dream that young life's guilelessness, Its fervent love, and holy trust, Are garnered there, to soothe and bless The heart, whose hopes are dust. Oh! how the spirit clings to earth, Where no abiding-place is given, Forgetful of the mystic birth That makes it heir of heaven. THE THREE CROWNS. She wore the crown of Beauty, A queen of hearts was she; And proud and strong men at her feet Adored on bended knee; She seemed a thing to worship, So regal was her grace, And such a seal of majesty Impressed her perfect face. Her cheeks were red with beauty, Her smile was rich with pearls, Her white brow shone like purity Amid her golden curls. Her eyes were like deep fountains Beneath the southern skies, In which the richest blue of heaven In pure reflection lies. Her voice was like the wild bird's, That sings her hymn at even; Her radiant smile came o'er the soul So like a dream of heaven. She wore the crown of Beauty, But wore it in her pride, And Envy with her withering breath Walked ever by her side. She wore the crown of Genius,â She ranged the field of thought; She studied nature's beauteous book, With holy lessons fraught; And tomes, that are to others Impenetrably sealed, Unclasping at her magic touch, Their precious lore revealed. With footsteps like the zephyr, She climbed Parnassus' height, And from its rainbow coronet, Wove garlands of delight; By Helicon's pure fountain She often paused to drink, To cull the never-fading flowers That clustered on its brink. Her mind was like pure waters, Where richest pearls abound; Her fancy strung them playfully, And threw them flashing round; She wore the crown of Genius, To which earth's monarchs bow; But it was fever to her heart, And ice upon her brow. She wore Religion's circlet,â A thorny crown it seemed, From which no sheen of yellow gold, No diamond lustre gleamed; But from its pure white blossoms Exhaled a fragrant balm, That lay upon her heart and life, A blessing and a charm. Above her fair young forehead It shone serenely bright, And Beauty's rose and Genius' gem Grew glorious in its light; That crown of holy meekness She wore in perfect peace; It shed a light of truth and love, And filled her soul with bliss. Wo to the crown of Beauty! Its flowers grew pale and sere, And its adorers fled like birds, When autumn days are drear; Wo to the crown of Genius! 'Twas cold upon her brow; Alas! 'tis only o'er the grave Its living jewels glow. All hail! Religion's chaplet,â We bless its heavenly power; There's healing in each verdant leaf, And balm in every flower; No blight, no change, no withering, Comes ever to that wreath; It blooms, a balm, a bliss in life, A glorious hope in death. A DREAM. I dreamedâ And lo, I lay upon the bed of pain, In bitter agony; a torturing fire Of fever scorched my brain and dimmed mine eyes, Though on my forehead lay big icy drops; I would have wiped them, and I raised my hand, But it was powerless, white, and cold as snow. Each pulse was but a throb of agony, As painfully I felt life's crimson tides Curdling along their channels. Heavily My heart was beating, and my tongue lay cold And languid in the hall of melody. My soul was suffocating, and I felt Impatience of the close and narrow room, That seemed to shut out the sweet breath of life. My children wept all wildly round my bed, With broken supplication unto God, That he would spare a life so dear to them; But I was weary of it, and my prayer, Wrung out by agony, was, âLet me rest!â I knew that death was present, and I ceased To struggle with him, and the conqueror pressed His icy hand upon my shuddering heart, And tore away the life-strings. Then I lay A spiritual essence on the air,â A balm, a beauty, an ecstatic bliss, Living in its own wealth of blessedness. I looked upon the clay that had so long Held me a prisoner. Where were now the pangs That wrung its nerves? Oh mystery of death! All calmly beautiful in its pale sleep, It lay before me. Death, which lay concealed In its first germ, which all its weary life Had dwelt within it, gnawing at its heart, And thrilling it with pangs, and dire disease, And slow decay, weakness, anxiety, And tears, and sighing, so that all its joys Were mixed with agony;âDeath now was dead; And that calm clay and the immortal mind Were freed from him for ever. Then I looked Upon my weepers, in their bitterness Clinging round that cold clay, or sobbing deep Upon each other's neck; and yet I felt No sympathy; not for my tenderest child; But said, with placid joy, âIf ye could know What peace, what bliss is mine, ye would not weep.â Now came a strain of music, like a breeze Bearing me upward with its ravishment Through the ethereal ocean, till at length I rose above this cloudy atmosphere, To the celestial radiance of God's day; And this great world rolled from beneath my feet, With mighty rushing sound of melody Along its shining path; apparent now Its sound and motion, as with majesty It marched along. In rapturous amaze I looked upon the shining hosts of worlds, The infinitely vast and beautiful Creations of Jehovah. Every where Wheeled the bright orbs, each floating in its own Peculiar atmosphere of streaming light, And uttering unto God a glorious voice. My being was all wonder and delight, As floating in this boundless wilderness Of rolling orbs, flashing their wings of flame, And speeding on their errands, I drank in The power and glory of Omnipotence. And there were groups of spirits, radiant With perfect loveliness, moving in bands, Or resting on their broad and silvery wings, In pure communion. Every perfect face Illumed with love and dazzling with delight; And as I passed they waved their glittering hands, And bade me speed my way, in words that came In swells of fragrant music. Oh, the bliss That filled my being! Was there aught on earth That could have won me to assume again My mortal prison, with its painful life Of weakness and pollution. What to me Were its affections, with their doubts and fears, Their thrilling joys, and bitter agonies? I had escaped them, and I was all bliss. Onward I passedâand now the atmosphere Became a crimson glory, every where Radiant with angel faces and bright forms, Gleaming amid the wreaths of wavy light, That seemed the glowing vapours of perfume From myriad censers, burning heavenly balm, And breathing, with the incense, holy hymns Of sweetness ravishing. âSpeed! sister, speed!â I heard sweet voices singingââSpeed thy course To Him who has redeemed thee from the earth, To whom be glory!â And the wide immense Re-echoed âGlory! Glory!â and a flood Of spirit-dazzling glory was revealed, And such an ecstacy of pure delight Burst on my spirit, that I joined the hymn, And with a shout of âGlory!â broke the spell Of that delightful visionary sleep, And the bright dream departed. The above Dream was written (I think) in the spring of 1842, and sent to a newspaper for publication. The editor kept it, and published a prose article, entitled, Dr. Watts' Dream, and the week after gave mine; whether he thought that my Dream was a plagiarism on the Doctor's, or only wished to have it so appear, I never inquired. However, I positively assert that when I wrote my Dream I had never seen or heard of Dr. Watts', and had no idea that any such composition was in existence. And yet there is between the two dreams a most striking similarityâsufficient to establish a belief in a candid mind that one was only a different version of the other. Thus, no doubt, many authors are convicted of plagiarism. That the same objects or circumstances, should awaken the same feelings and images in minds similarly constituted, is by no means wonderful; but that imagination should present scenes purely ideal, in such striking sameness of contour and colouring to different minds, is certainly a wonder, and is incomprehensible.âIt is nevertheless, in the present instance, solemnly trueâI have never imitated any writer, male or female,âand if ever in my wanderings beside the sweet waters, I have picked up shells or gathered flowers, similar to those appropriated by any who have preceded me; I certainly did not steal them from their cabinet, but found them myself, and they are mine. THE WIND. Oh, wind! where is thy home, Thy resting-place? Where dost thou plume thy wings to roam In pathless fields of space? Thou comest with viewless wing And mystic voice, And leaves, and blossoms, and glad birds of spring, Awaken and rejoice. Whence comest thou with thy songs That glad the earth, And call her myriad infant throngs Of beauty into birth? All nature's precious balm From southern shores, All pleasant sounds, all sights, and scents that charm, Thou makest ours. Whence is thy strength, that bows The forest down, And dashes from the mountain brows The ancient emerald crown? That lifts the eternal rock From its strong rest, And hurls it rudely with tremendous shock, From ledgy crest? That levels with the dust The castled tower, And many a pile which mortals boast, As monuments of power? Whence thy tremendous power, That crests the waves, And heaves them, shouting, on the sounding shore, Or marble caves? Cradled amid thy plumes The lightnings sleep, Till on thy breath through surging glooms The glittering terrors sweep. The thunder's fearful sound Is born of thee, Which leaping onward rends the dark profound, And shakes immensity. Where is thy home, oh! wind! Hark! the replyâ âI dwell with the Immortal Mindâ Type of His majesty;â Invisible and free, With hymning flight, I range the solid earth and rolling sea, Diffusing life and light. âYe hear my rushing sound, But cannot know From whence I run my glorious round, Or to what realms I go. All nature owns my sway, And loves my voice; The earth, the waters, and the clouds obey, And in my power rejoice. âYe tremble at my might, And yet I come Diffusing fragrance and delight, Beauty, and bliss, and bloom. O'er earth, and all her train Of living things, A quickening spirit of all life I reign, With all-pervading wings. âGod fills infinity With life and bliss, Life, that endureth to eternity, And everlasting peace; And unto me 'tis given To shadow forth The Power that fills, and rules, and gladdens heaven, As I pervade the earth.â TO THE SEDOLEO. Sweetest of the hymning band, That come on spirit wing, Chaunting through the listening land The presence of the spring. When the soft blue eye of day First opens on thy nest, Lighting with its emerald ray The forest's leafy crest, Softly through the spirit streams Thy mellow joyous lay, Mingling with our troubled dreams, And melting them away. Like a tuneful angel's hymn, Thrilling through the soul, Ere life's cares and shadows dim Assert their stern control; Bearing up the soul to God, Source of joy and light; In one full melodious flood, Drowning all of night. When the busy burning day, With his toil and care, Passes to the west away, And lingers smiling there; Free from toil and turmoil now, In the blessed calm, Gratefully we bathe the brow In evening breath of balm. While the fevered pulse subsides, And the mind grows still, While gray evening's drapery hides All of earthly ill; Then thy plaintive flute-like lay, From the shadowy trees, Fills with soothing melody The cool refreshing breeze. Sweetest of the birds of spring! Oft at dreamy even I have thought thy damask wing Came fresh and pure from heaven; That thou wert a spirit bright, Missioned from above, Plumed with joy's own rosy light, And voiced with holy love. Seraph of the twilight hour, Sure of heaven thou art, Hushing with melodious power The wrung and throbbing heart. MY OLD LETTERS. One hour amongst my treasures! Oh 'tis sweetâ Mournfully sweetâto this o'erburdened heart, To turn from all life's present cares and toils,â Injustice, bitterness, and agony,â To pass one hour amid the treasured gems, Which I have gathered in life's weary ways, Since first in childhood's morn my little heart Was made to understand such bitter words As partingâabsenceâsorrowâand vain hope,â Till now, that I have gained the rugged steep Of life's meridian, whence the earnest eye Looks down the shadowy path, which hath no bourne, Except the cold, dark grave.âOh, there is peace, And rest, for all the weary! Some of those Whose pledges of a never-dying love Perfume these faded leaflets of their souls, Have gone down there to sleep; and I have wept, And counted them, the lost. But 'tis not so; The truthful breathings of their loving souls Live on these written sheets, where here and there A tear, that gushed up warm from the live heart, Lies where it fell, more precious than the pearl That's purchased with a kingdom. They are lost Who live and have forgotten! Unto them Be joy, and wealth, and honour. 'Tis enough That I am sorrowful, and feel the bond Of absence always straining at my heart. I will not now weep o'er the registers Of such unstable minds; though broken buds, And withered leaves, that grew in my warm heart, Upon the trees that Hope had planted there, Are folded up within them. Let them rest;â I would not now disturb them, and inhale Their breath, so faint, so withering to the soul. Sad records of the weakness of the mind, The faithlessness of poor humanity, Go to your hiding-place, while I unfold The leaves of these unwilted flowers of Truth, That breathe so rich an odour. Fresh and sweet They lie before me. The white jessamine buds Of pure young girlhood's offering; the white rose Of womanhood's devotion; myrtle leaves And sprigs of green geraniums from the stems Of manhood's hardier friendship; and a few (Oh dearly they are treasured) red rose leaves, Rich with the breathings of a fervent love. Where are the hands that wrote these living lines So many years ago? Where are the eyes That bent their burning beams or tearful gaze Along the rapid tracery? Where the hearts That throbbed with yearning tenderness the while; Now trembling with emotion, pausing now With doubt, or apprehension, or cold fear; Or agonizing with the hope deferred, That seems so long in coming? Years,âand change,â And death,âcan ye not answer?âNo reply Do ye vouchsafe to any. Death, and change, And time, are silent spoilers. All in vain The hearts that ye have robbed shriek out, and plead For restitution, or one little word, To calm their burning anguish. Ye are deaf To all entreaty, and, since time began, Have never answered to the earnest prayer That knocked in agony at the cold gates Of your mysterious, silent palaces. But o'er these precious treasures of my heart Ye have no power. The rapid lapse of years, The stern mutations of all things that feel The tide of life, the hand that breaks the heart And crushes loveliness, and over all Spreads charnel mould and ashes,ânone of these Can touch the pure affections of the soul, That God has made immortal, and which live For me, for ever, in these written sheets. Here are the careless folded sheets, and scraps Impressed so lightly by the little hand Of my first correspondent, while her breast Was spotless of a stain, before her heart Had known the blight of sorrow, or the joy That lies so heavily within the heart, And, like the nectar in the blossom's cup, Bends down the head with sweetness. She was fair, Rich in a loveliness of form and mind, If not unequalled, never yet excelled; And these sweet records of her young, pure soul Breathe round me, ever spring's own atmosphere Of light, and song, and odour. Hope stood by When these glad lines were written; and no shade Of pain or sorrow mingled with the hues Upon the bright cartoon on which her hand Had sketched our drama of futurity. Her lines are sweet enchantment; like the song Of some caged bird, which (if we shut our eyes) Transports us to the green and flower-wreathed grove In which it caroled to the loving mate That hears its song no more. No more!âAh me! Who sings that dirge-like word so mournfully Along the heart-strings? searing with its tone The bright-eyed memories that were singing there. I know that girlhood with its laughing joys Can come to me no more,âthat my schooled heart Can dance to hope's ecstatic hymn no more; And that the wreath's sweet, perfect flowers, That spent their fragrance on my breast and brow, Can bloom for me no more; that I can feel The blissful confidence with which young life Relies on human worth and purity No more; that all the sweet and beautiful, That bloomed and faded in the pleasant ways Of young life's mazy wanderings, can return To cheer my steps no more. Yet sing ye on, Sweet, faithful memories, till my soul forgets The present in the music of the past. Sing on, and spread your tableaux; I will deem Myself a child again, and range with her The well-remembered scenes. Spring is in the soft blue sky, Smiling, silvery clouds between, As a loving azure eye 'Twixt the pearly lids is seen. Spring is in the balmy air, As it gaily coquets by, Touching all the sweet and fair With a kiss of melody. Spring is in the river's song, As it proudly marches by, Bearing on its breast along Ships that ride right gallantly. Spring is in the rivulet's hymn, Where it gushes from its source; Spring awakes the thickets dim, All along its tuneful course. Spring is in the dewy eye Of each fresh and fragrant flower; While the birds that nestle by, Call her name from bower to bower. We are roving by the brook, Where the early violets grow, Searching thicket, bank, and nook, Where all buds of April blow. We are shouting in our glee, As we break the slender stems; Or we praise, on bended knee, Him who gives the floral gems. We are seated 'neath the thorn, Gaily braiding for our brows Flowers of balm and beauty born With the slender willow boughs. Now our song is on the air, Blending with the blue-bird's lay; All that lives is sweet and fair, All that breathes is melody. We are weary of our play,â 'Tis the pleasant eventide; We have thrown our crowns away, And are seated side by side. See, within the ancient room, Filling settee, chair, and stool, Smiling through the mellow gloom, Are the loved, the beautiful. Now the father, whom we love, Leaning on his wonted chair, To our FatherâGod aboveâ Offers up the evening prayer. Pale and reverend is his brow, Slow and solemn is his tone;â Ah, the tears are gushing nowâ Memory's vivant scenes are flown. But that prayerâit seemeth still Rising to the Mercy Seat; Winning thence, to guard from ill, Holy angels, fair and sweet. Oh how kind their voices are, When the heart has erred and feared, Answering ever to despair, There is mercyâwe are heard. 'Tis very sweet to dream that those who led Our infant feet in good and pleasant ways, Who brought us, while our hearts were yet untouched By this world's mildew, to a Saviour's feet, And showed us where to find a hiding-place From all the tempests of this changing world; Who bore us in the arms of earnest prayer Up to the throne of heaven,âwho led the way, And left their footprints all along the path Of peace, which leads to God,â'tis sweet to dream That they are watching with their loving eyes Our struggles with the spirits that would lure Our faltering steps to their enticing bowers Of smiling agony, and death disguised In bridal robes and garlands. It is good To lean upon them then, and ask our hearts If those who look upon us from on high, Approve our words and deeds. They seem so near, Our souls can almost touch them, and we lean So naturally on their love and careâ Oh who should throw the clear, cold light of truth Into the temple where fond nature shrines These beautiful illusions, which so aid Our trembling spirits through the labyrinth That lies between the cradle and the grave! Dear guardians of my childhood! if 'tis true That ye in heaven remember me no more, Ye are my guardians still. Your loving words Of sweet encouragement, of kind advice, Of earnest sympathy, of mild reproof, Of spiritual communion,âthey are here, To aid, uphold, and solace this poor heart In its extremest need. And when my day Is dark as midnight, and I stand alone, Amid the desert of a weary life, With none to cheer me, none to guide my steps, Or bring me consolation;âwhen no voice Of hope cries, âCourage, sister! help is near, Press on and win the prize!ââstill ye are near; I feel your presence, and ye point away To that far land, where living waters flow, And joy-buds bloom for ever. Blessed lines! Traced by those reverend and sustaining hands, I would not change ye for the title-deeds Of earth's most glorious empire. âYour ever-loving mother.â Blessed words, Almost effaced with tears, which dim mine eyes Whene'er they rest upon that signature, So beautifully written by the hand That was my providence in infancy And early childhood; that directed first My young eyes unto heaven; that led me forth Amid the glorious works of nature's God, And, pointing to the pure and beautiful, Taught me to love and worship; that sustained My weakness with unwearied tenderness; That made my bed in sickness, lifted up My aching head, and held to my parched lips The cup of healing; that has done for me That which no other hand on earth has done; That which no other hand on earth can do. My âloving mother.ââThou art far away; I may not clasp thy hand, or hear thy voice, Or look into thy beautiful mild eyes; But I can read these letters, which thy hand Has written to me, which thine eyes have read, With tears of tender feeling, while thy heart, Thy mother-heart, was throbbing for thy child, Thy desolate and solitary child, The dweller of the forest; she for whom Thou dost so without ceasing offer prayer. Mother! dear mother! though we dwell apart, Thy loving words are with me evermoreâ Thy precious loving words. Thy hand, and heart, And earnest soul of love, are here impressed, For me, a dear memorial through all time. Mother! I cannot recompense thy love, But thy reward is sure, for thou hast done Thy duty perfectly, and we rise up And call thee blessed; and the Lord shall give Thy pious cares and labours rich reward. Ah! here are missives that came unto me Like messengers from heaven; seeking me out In this old forest, where my lot was cast In early womanhood, away from all That makes life beautiful, that fills the soul, Or lifts the heart from earth,âexcept the voice Of nature in her wildest, sternest forms. Yes, even here thy warm and pious heart Pursued the child of thy pastoral care With godly counsel, urging her to hope, To walk in the undeviating path Of truth and duty, with the heart and eye Fixed ever on the shining gate of heaven, With faith and humble confidence in Him Who dwells not in the temple's gorgeous pile, But in the heart, the pure and earnest heart That offers incense unto Him alone. My dear and reverend friend, thou didst not know What joy these letters brought me;âhow I wept For very gladness, ere I broke their seals;â How my soul drank their contents, and looked up Refreshed and strengthened, with a grateful hymn To God, for such a friend, and unto thee For thine unceasing care, until I seemed To hear the music of the Sabbath bells, And stand amongst the worshippers, who felt The import of those solemn words,ââThe Lord Is in his holy temple,ââand bow down In silent awe before the majesty Of Him whose glorious presence fills all space. Mine ever-honoured Pastor, though no more My voice shall murmur its response to thine, Or join the solemn chaunt; though never more My heart shall tremble while thou dost unfold The Gospel message of eternal life, Still I will hope that in the august day Which wakes a world to judgment, I may be A living leaf amongst the gems that form The crown of thy rejoicing. My brother! best and dearest, these are thine, And they are fragrant with the purest love That hath its sources at the gushing spring Of human tenderness. My sisters, too, Here are their precious offerings. Oh 'tis sweet To taste the fulness of this perfect love, Until the heart forgets its weariness, And all its scars and mildews, and goes back To that most holy refuge this side heaven, Our father's house. Oh, sweet the echoes come Through the dim distance and long lapse of years, From that dear sanctuary of holy love. How pleasantly they touch my heart-strings now, To melting music, mellowed down by time To plaintive sweetness! 'Tis our mother's voice, Which calleth at the pleasant evening time, âCome, children! take your seats beside the fire.â The fire is blazing on the ample hearth, Diffusing comfort through the antique room, And we are watching in our simple mirth The giant shadows starting from the gloom. With seeming menace and imperious air They seem to beckon with their wavering hands, And flit away. We wonder whence they are, And seek to reason of the ghostly bands. But at our mother's voice we leave our play, And crowd our low seats close around her chair; Each prompt to meet the loving smiles that play Upon her lips and brow so purely fair. Her beautiful white hand forsakes awhile The task by love made pleasant for our sake, To rest a moment with caressing wile, On brows that 'neath that pressure could not ache. Her clear eyes rest with proud yet troubled joy Upon the blue-eyed treasures at her feet; The rosy girl, the noble-hearted boy, The little smilers, with their prattle sweet. All good and happy, through her pious care, Loving and well-beloved, a blessed band, All leaning on her love, rejoiced to share The blessing of her voice, her love, her hand. Ay, now, our father, who, the whole day long, Had plied the art by which he earns us bread, With glance of pleasure on his own glad throng, Sits down to taste the feast for reason spread. His much-loved bookâthe poet's lofty lay, The traveller's tale of strange and far-off lands, The voyager's story of the mighty sea, The attention of the little group commands. We listen, full of wonder and delight, Until the witching volume is laid by, And loving voices breathe the kind âGood night!â And light lids close above each sleepy eye. Sweet were our slumbers then. We laid us down With faith in God, and in our parents' care, No sorrow held us waking, no deep grief Took form of fearful dreams, and made our sleep More painful than our hours of waking wo. We slept the dewy sleep of innocence, And woke to love and peace, while on us all Our parents smiled at once. Oh, long ago Those blessed days departed, we are rest And scattered like the leaves of some fair rose, That fall off one by one upon the breeze, Which bears them where it listeth. Never more Can they be gathered and become a rose, And we can be united never more A family on earth. Alas! that death, And love, and sorrow, have so scattered us Abroad upon the world, that there remains No tie between our souls, but memory, Linked to the yearning heart, and kept alive By these frail messengers, which come and go, Bearing a world of love, or joy, or grief, Beneath their brittle seals, from West to East, From North to South, around the peopled globe, So that the very pulsings of the heart, Which stamps itself upon the written sheet, Are felt, despite the distance. Oh, the heart! It mocks at distance, and smiles scornfully When fate builds up her everlasting wall Between it and its loves. It heareth still The voices of its kindred, and it feels The slightest tremor of the hidden strings That bind each unto each. It feels, it knows The love, the joy, the fear, the agony That thrill its own, though it be prisoned far Beyond the mountains; though the billowy sea Divide it from the bosom which enshrines Its sympathizing mate; ah, though the grave Be closed above it, still it seems to lie Against its fellow, with a cold still weight, Benumbing to the centre all its tides Of happiness; and when corroding time Has worn its form away, the sable dust, The poor remains of all corporeal things, Is strewn o'er all the buds of tenderness That struggle up and seek to blossom there, Still marring all their beauty. Here they lieâ The little packets tied around with black; Volumes of love, from hearts and hands that lie Down in the narrow chamber. These are thine, Companion of my childhood, gentle girl Of deep dark eyes, so eloquent of love, And grief, and sympathy. Thy lot was sad And meekly borne. The canker of disease Fell on thee in the morning of thy years, And gnawed life's healthy stamen; but thy form Acquired a holy beauty from the blight; And thy young spirit, feeling how the ties That held it earthward perished, and became Attenuated, looked with firmer trust And holier hope to heaven, and so became A very angel, save the sympathies And weariness of life, the love that yearned To see its object happy, and put on A radiant smile to hide the burning seal Which marked the young fair forehead for the grave. And thou wouldst speak so sweetly, while thy breast Was tortured with the gnawing of the death That fed upon thy being. It was sad To see thee in thy beauty bending down With such a gentle patience to the grave, Which pale consumption with her meagre hand Was digging at thy feet. But that is pastâ Thy soul is ransomed, and thou art at rest; Peace to thy spirit. Though we wept for thee, Thy lot was more desirable than mine; Thy bark was safely anchored, ere the storm Had burst upon it; ere the thunderbolt Had riven its heart to splinters; ere its hull Was shattered on the treacherous lurking shoals, To which sweet sirens, in their floating bowers, Allured it with their tuneful witcheries; Ere its white sails were mildewed; ere its chart Was soiled and torn; before its compass lost The fine attraction to the steady pole, Which marked its course aright, in storm or calm. Before the stream of life, which at its source Was pure and narrow, and pursued its way Through sunny valleys, smiling with the buds And balmy flowers of spring, grew wide and deep, And rolled its turbid volume through a land Of rock and sandy desert, where green trees Are seldom seen, and every herb and flower Accounted as a blessing; ere the wreaths Culled gayly from the banks of the young stream Had lost their bloom and fragrance; ere the barks That sported round us in their trim array, With pennons, songs, and gladness, covering The tide with joy and beauty, are all lost, So that the weary eyes look back in vain, To catch one sail of all the brilliant group, Till they are dimmed with tears. Ah, wo is me! That my poor bark is shattered and alone Upon the dark wide stream, which marches on Still farther every moment from the shore, Where youth and joy were dancing to the songs Of bright-eyed innocence, so long ago, That now some trembling echoes of the strain, With now and then a soft and silvery gush Of distant laughter, floating on the tide All faintly to mine ears, declare how far The waves have borne me from those blessed bowers. And still I am their sport; while thou art safe In that fair country, where immortal bliss Blooms in the sunlight of eternal love. Eternal love! As if there were a love That is not everlasting, that can change, And die, like summer flowers. Oh Love, forgive The seeming treason! This poor heart of mine Is not so unfamiliar with thy power, As to believe thee mortal, born of earth, And passing with its shadows. Love is pure, And dwelleth ever with the beautiful. Love never changeth,âBeauty will endure As long as any thing that God has made Shall wear the impress of his perfect hand. But we are changing, and our beauty's bloom Fades even in the bud. Our souls are weak, And bend like rushes to the fitful gusts Of passions all unholy; and we burn Strange incense, kindled with unhallowed fire, Upon the holiest altar of our hearts, Within the temple consecrate to Love, And he deserts the desecrated shrine. Though he may pity our wild agony, He will not stay to soothe us. 'Tis not meet That he should nestle in the earth-born wreaths With which we seek to bind him, and remain When they are withered, and the canker-worms Apparent in their heart. Yet Love is true, And hath eternal life; and all the pure, And all the beautiful, are full of Love, Linked by a chain of holy sympathies To Love's immortal heart, which pulses bliss Through all the braided chain, till every link Rings forth a living voice of melody; These blessed voices, blending like the chime From myriad golden bells, rise up to God, And mingle with the harmony of heaven. Heaven! Love!âOh heaven is love, and love is heaven, And every heart that proves the power of love, Has felt the bliss of heaven, and can attest That Love is an eternity of bliss, Which raises, purifies, and fills the soul, And knits its sympathies all unto God. But this world hath a heavy atmosphere, Oppressed with darkness, frost, and stormy winds, And poor humanity is sick, and weak, And purblind in her vision, and her ear Is dull of hearing, and the iron chain Of nature lieth on her quivering wing With weight of doubt and sorrow. Yet we shrink And shudder, when the gentle hand of death Would set us free, and bear us to the world Of beauty, love, and glory.â Oh forgive, My loved, and loving, that I sometimes weep, And count ye lost to me. 'Tis when my soul Is darkened by the shadows that obscure The narrow windows of its house of clay, And I forget how bright, how beautiful, How blessed, and how perfect, ye are now; And that your love is all divinely pure, And fervent, as the fire that hallows heaven. But thou wert very pure, my gentle friend, Almost a seraph, in thy mortal form, And thou hast left sweet records of thy love, Traced by thy slender fingers, even when death Was busy at their nerves, and those dark eyes, Though strangely lustrous with the hectic fire, Unsteady in their light, and often dimmed By the near shadow of the coffin lid. Ah me! I cannot now restrain my tears, As I peruse these lines, which long ago I blotted with such drops, which neither Time, With his slow opiate, nor Philosophy, With his cold torpor, nor Religion's voice Of balmy soothing, can forbid to flow, Whene'er, amongst the treasures of the past, I meet these leaflets of my broken rose. Oh here are well-known seals, that came to me Like angel messengers, each with its gifts Of thrilling joy. Mine eyes can beam no more With such a greeting as they gave to these; My heart can feel no more the bounding bliss That blest it, as I pressed them to my lips. They waken now a mournful memory, Which lives within my spirit as a thing Enshrined, and sacred, which no mortal eye May ever look upon. My soul is sad Amid its richest treasures. Though they breathe The sweetest music, still my spirit hears, Amidst their loftiest hymn, an under-tone, Which wails of absence, death, and lovely hopes That perished in the bosom of the years That will return no more. Return no more! However carelessly we touch the string That choruses the music of the past, It answers mournfully: No more!âNo more! My loved, my absent, and my glorified, Though we in this fair world may meet no more, Still I possess the impress of your souls In these dear letters,âand I sometimes bless The fate that led me to this solitude, To which the earnest heart of faithful love Pursues me with its blessed messengers. These are my consolation, when my feet Are weary, in the thorny path of life; And when my heart, my timid woman-heart, Is yearning for a word of sympathy, A glance of kind approval, or one drop Of earnest consolation, then 'tis good To turn me to these angels, which my lot, My isolated and peculiar lot, Has won from great and good and tender hearts, Which thus have poured the treasures of their thoughts Into my bosom,âcompensation rich For all my loneliness; a living balm For all the painful bruises of my heart; A breastwork of defence against the shafts Of cruelty's sharpshooters; and a stay On which I may rely, when bitter words Fall on my head and heart, till I grow faint, And almost doubt myself. Oh then 'tis sweet To feel that ye who knew my inmost soul, Ye who were pure, and competent to judge, Too good and wise to flatter or deceive, Spake thus to her, whose heart, and soul, and mind, And words, and actions, even the warmest leaf Of fond affection's dearly-cherished rose, Were to your spirits as an open book. Yes, here is comfort. But, dear comforters, The cares of life, a stern and clamorous throng, Are waking now. Go to your sanctuary,â And when my heart is heavy unto death, Again your kind communing and soft balm Shall soothe it to the meek and grateful frame Which sits down patiently at Jesus' feet. SING ON! âSing on!âYou will win the wreath of Fame: if not in life, it will bloom gloriously over your tomb.â Friendly Correspondence. 'Tis not for Fame: I know I may not win A wreath from high Parnassus, for my name Is written on the page of humble life, From which the awarders of the laurel wreath Avert their eyes with scorning. I have felt The mildew of affliction, the east wind Of withering contempt, the pelting storms Of care, and toil, and bitterness, and wo, In almost every form. I too have known The darkness of bereavement, and keen pangs Which woman may not utter, though her heart Consume amid their fierceness, and her brain Burn to a living cinder; though the wound Which is so hard to bear, lie festering deep Within her outraged spirit; though her sighs Disturb the quiet of the blessed night, While sweet dews cool and soothe the fevered breast Of every other mourner; though she pour The flood of life's sweet fountain out in tears, Along her desert pathway; while the blooms Of health, and hope, and joy, that should have fed Upon its gushing waters and rich dew, Lie withered in her bosom, breathing forth The odours of a crushed and wasted heart, That cannot hope for soothing or redress, Save in the quiet bosom of the grave, And in the heaven beyond. 'Tis not for Fame That I awaken with my simple lay The echoes of the forest. I but sing As sings the bird, that pours her native strain, Because her soul is made of melody; And lingering in the bowers, her warblings seem To gather round her all the tuneful forms, Whose bright wings shook rich incense from the flowers, And balmy verdure of the sweet young spring, O'er which the glad day shed his brightest smile, And night her purest tears. I do but sing Like that sad bird, who in her loneliness, Pours out in song the treasures of her soul, Which else would burst her bosom, which has nought On which to lavish the warm streams that gush Up from her trembling heart, and pours them forth Upon the sighing winds, in fitful strains. Perchance one pensive spirit loves the song, And lingers in the twilight near the wood, To list her plaintive sonnet, which unlocks The sealed fountain of a hidden grief.â That pensive listener, or some playful child, May miss the lone bird's song, what time her wings Are folded in the calm and silent sleep, Above her broken heart. Then, though they weep In her deserted bower, and hang rich wreaths Of ever-living flowers upon her grave, What will it profit her who would have slept As deep and sweet without them? Oh! how vain, With promised garlands for the sepulchre, To think to cheer the soul, whose daily prayer Is but for bread and peace!âwhose trembling hopes For immortality ask one green leaf From off the healing trees that grow beside The pure bright river of Eternal Life. DREAMS. How sweet the dreams of joy and love, That visit our repose! Like gentle spirits from above, With balsam for our woes. How soft the dreaming angels come, And lay their shadowy wings O'er all the sorrows of my lot, And all unpleasant things. Then cares and pains of recent years, And darker things are hid; While tenderly they kiss the tears From off the trembling lid. And then from Memory's treasured wreath, They cull the holiest flowers; And build, and deck in richest bloom, A thousand fairy bowers; And tenant them with fair bright things, That long from me have fled, Some, on their own inconstant wings, Some, to the dreamless bed. My early home, with all its joys, Is spread before me then, And tender tones and beaming eyes Speak to my soul again. Again the garden, field, and grove, Are rich with fruits and flowers; And birds are singing in their love, In all the breezy bowers. And voices, sweeter than the birds, More fragrant than the flowers, With melody of gentle words, Enchant the joyous hours. Then every tone, and glance, and smile, Is innocence and truth; And earnest hearts unite the while, In firmest faith of youth. Affections long since wrecked, or dead, Are warm and trusted then; And beauteous, from the grass-grown bed, My lost ones come again. Oh! where have young life's dear delights Found an abiding home? From whence to bless these joyless nights, Their dreamy spirits come? HYMN FOR CHRISTMAS. Hail! holy morn, above all others blessed, Day heralded by angels from above, With hymns of glory unto God on high, And promises to men of peace and love. Hail, holy morning! Birthday of the King Of Life, of Peace, and Glory! Joy to earth! We come with palms, and songs, and offerings, To keep the festival of Jesus' birth. When first upon the dark chaotic mass Moved God's Creative Spirit, bringing forth Order, and light, and beauty, and young life, 'Till in its orbit hung the perfect Earth;â When scents and colours in the flowers had birth, And myriad forms of life began to move; When in his Maker's image man was made, In beauty perfect, animate with love; Then heaven was vocal with the choral hymn Of radiant morning stars, and this glad earth Echoed the shouts with which the sons of God Poured forth their wondering joy at Nature's birth. If there was such rejoicing, when a world Was born to death, and man to guilt and wo, What songs, what joy should hail the better morn That saw Immanuel cradled here below! Ay, cradled in a manger,âsleeping there The soft unconscious sleep of infancy, Watched by his fair young mother's dewy eyes, While angels sung the Christ's nativity. Glory to God! in highest, gladdest strains,â Peace upon earth, and good will unto men! âGlory to God!â the holy seraphs sung, âGlory to God!â let earth reply again. Joy to the world! The Babe of Bethlehem Is now the King of glory, throned above; He has redeemed his people from their sins, With mighty sufferings, and surpassing love. Oh! come, and let us worship, bending low With tearful penitence, and humble joy; Let every heart adore, and every voice Hymn forth a song of grateful melody. Come to his temple, where the living greens Are twined to do him honour; where his name Swells on the pealing anthem, till all hearts Are full of heavenâdevotion's ardent flame. Come to his holy templeâHe is there, To bless the souls that seek him. Let us bring Our evergreen faith, hope, and charity, In humble offering. Let us kneel and sing:â Hail, day of solemn gladness! Through all time Highest and holiest. Angels shout again, To you is born a Saviour, Christ, the Lord! Glory to God!âPeace and good will to men!â Saviour of manâEternal Son of God, Who once in Bethlehem's lowly manger lay, Oh! throne thyself in every humble heart, That comes to celebrate thy natal day! LIFE'S CHANGES. I saw her in her sunny loveliness, In ripened beauty, both of form and face; The morning flush of girlhood was no more, With careless tone, free step, and merry laugh; The sun of love had melted these away. As day dispels the glitter of the dew, And melts away the crimson morning cloud That veils the deep bright azure of the heaven, Revealing all its ocean-flood of light, So shone the soul of woman all unveiled In its deep love and truth upon her face, And 'mongst the gentle creatures that looked out From those clear eyes, a trembling spirit lay, Which told that she would sleep the careless sleep Of girlhood never more. Yet such a smile Of holy tenderness was on her lips As never graced the face of maidenhood, For on her bosom slept her own young babe, Her first, her precious one. The dewy rose Of love maternal, sweetest bloom of earth, Lay in her bosom, with the wakeful cares That grow in thorny clusters on its stem. But Hope stood smiling by;âher sunny hair Wreathed with the brightest buds and flowers of spring; Her magic harp displayed the morning star, And such a trancing melody she sung, As wrapped the mother's heart in trembling bliss, As closer to her heart she hugged the babe, And pressed upon its cheek a warmer kiss. Again I saw that mother. Beautiful She was, like summer when the flowers are gone, And deep green garland glittering to the sun, Like brooding pinions tremble o'er the spring. Her eyes were full of joy, a pure, proud joy, For they were fixed in love upon her child, A maid of perfect beauty and rich mind, Yet meek and gentle as the petted lamb. She sat upon a sofa, and the book In which the humble find eternal life, Lay open on her knees, and her sweet voice Pronounced its treasured words so feelingly, That the delighted mother's soul went out To that sweet pious child with tender bliss. Hope still was there, with wreaths of fragrant flowers, And her emblazoned harp, crowned gloriously With blossomed laurel from the Muses' hill, Fresh with the dew that heaven benignly weeps On Zion's holy mountain. Still a tear Stood in her azure eye, for she perceived, Amid the garlands that she gloried in, Some pale and drooping flowers, and well she knew That the insidious canker of disease Lay in their velvet bloom, eating their life, And with her song was blent a low sad strain, So sweet and dirgelike, filling every pause, That those who listened wept, they knew not why. Once more I saw that motherâbut her cheek Was pale and hollow, and upon her brow Was written deep the tracery of care. Amid the locks combed smoothly o'er her brow Were many threads of white, and her blue eyes Were dim and full of tears. Her form was bent, As if her heart was broken, and her soul Crushed down and longing for the quiet graveâ That holy chamber, where no pain, or fear, Or sorrow, enters with its bitterness, To agitate the still and silent heart. The daughter she had so entirely loved, Her only joyâthe tender fragrant rose, Whose balmy beauty had been all her bliss, Lay there before her, still and beautiful, All robed in white and crowned with pale sweet flowers. Is she a bride to-day? If it be so, Why is her cheek so white, and wherefore lie The soft brown lashes of her heavy eyes So fixedly upon her velvet cheek? And why is there no motion to disturb The thin transparent hands, that lie so still Upon her bosom? Wherefore is the smile Upon her lips so fixed, so spiritless? And why is her pure brow so marble-like And mute in its expression? She is dead! And ready to be carried to the grave! The mother's eye, which for so many years Had turned for all its joy-beams unto her, Must see the coffin closed, and the cold sods Heaped over the fine form, concealing it For everâoh, for ever!âfrom her view. How shall she bear it? How shall she endure This bitter breaking of the tenderest tie Amongst her heart-strings? Oh, delusive Hope! Where now are all thy brilliant promises? And where thy fragrant garlands? Where art thou? Oh, meek and ever-present comforter! Sweet solace of all ills, behold she stands Supporting the bereaved so tenderly; Her earth-born flowers lie withered at her feet, And wet with tearsâbut o'er her placid brow Is twined fresh balm of Gilead, and her harp Wears, like a coronet, the bow of heaven. The living laurel, late its glorious crown, Hangs on the everlasting arch of Fame, Where cloudless sunshine and the purest dew, Will rest on it for ever. Blessed Hope!â She sings so softly now, and points away To ever-blooming gardens of delight, Where, 'midst ten thousand young and lovely forms, By Mercy taken from life's wilderness Before the mildew or the canker-worm Had touched their tender beauty,âwrapped in bliss, Which fills the spirit, so that it hath nought To wish or hope for, yet increases still, Expanding with the soul's capacities, And filling them for everâthat sweet child Lives, radiant with immortal happiness. And canst thou wish her back to earth? she asks, Where thou shalt linger but few years at most. No, rather let me lead thee to the gate Of her bright resting-placeâthe gate at which I take my leave of all earth's travellers; I have no place in the eternal world; The dwellers in the bright land need me not, And at the gate of everlasting night Despair forbids my entrance. Yet on earth I live, sustain, and soothe, and sing of heaven. âOh, blessed, holy Hope!â the mourner sighed, âI do not mourn as those who see thy lyre Unstrung and crushed, amid thy perished flowers; I knowâI know! that my Redeemer lives, That in his presence I shall meet my child, In deathless joy and beauty.â JESUS WALKING ON THE WATER. âAnd in the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.ââ Mark xiv. 26. When life's clear untroubled waters, In the morning sunlight flowed, In the barge of girlish gladness Down the pleasant stream I rode. All the shores were green with bowers, Where the wild birds sung of love, Every breeze waved wreaths of flowers, Silver-pebbled strands above; While in rich and languid beauty, Still by creek and shallow bay, Trembling on the dimpling waters, Wreaths of lotus-lilies lay. Variegated birds were sporting 'Mid the blossoms on the tide, Life, and love, and joy, and beauty, Dressed the scene on every side. Friendship o'er the chart presided, Hope sat smiling at the oar, Love and Joy, with siren voices, Sung the bliss of flood and shore. But the whirlwinds of affliction Woke me from my sweet repose, And the heavy clouds of sorrow On the stormy gale arose. Then upheaved the crested billow, Tossing with exulting howl, As the lion, roused from slumber, Shakes his mane with threatening growl. All my sea-birds, wild with terror, Sprang, shrill shrieking from the flood, Meteors seemed their flashing pinions, As above the surge they rode. And the pearly water-lilies, From their oozy beds uptorn, Were in wrecked and broken beauty By the conquering billows worn. While, with hoarse and angry chiding, On the shore, the driving spray Swept the bird's nest and the blossoms From the ruined bower away. One wild scene of desolation Spread its forms by land and tide, One deep voice of utter anguish Moaned around on every side. O'er the glad day's radiant features Twilight spread her mantle dark, Blackness, death, and deep destruction, Gathered round my shuddering bark. In that hour of night and horror, While despair rode on the storm, Walking on the rolling billows, I beheld a shining form. Oh, how dreadful was his presence, As he walked the waves alone, In the pure and radiant glory That around his person shone. Nearer came the august vision; Burst my fears in one wild cry; Then he spake in tones of music: âBe not fearfulâIt is I!â Then I knew himâIt was Jesus, He, whom winds and waves obey, He, who o'er the fiercest spirits, Rules with calm and potent sway. Help, Lord! help me, or I perish! See, my bark is all a wreck; Jesus heard, and, touched with pity, Stepped upon the wave-washed deck. Instantly the winds subsided, And the billows sunk to rest; Rose the sun, and showed before me Scenes in heavenly beauty drest. Lord! I pray thee, guide my vessel Down this swift and treacherous flood, To the land where peace eternal Smiles around the throne of God. HE DIED. He died!âThis sentence hath a fearful sound To every mortal ear; He died! He died! Is written on the page of history, From Adam, downward, to the present day. The consummation of the lot of man, With all his years, his good and evil deeds, His hopes, his fears, and joys, is thisâHe died. The hero lived; he conquered states and kings, He rased the stately city to the ground; He led his myriads to the battle-field, And made earth fat with bloodâat length he died! Fame blazons forth his acts, but Pity weeps, And kind Humanity conceals her face, While Virtue blushes o'er his epitaph. The monarch swayed the sceptre of a realm; His will was law; he held the destinies Of many millions. He was honoured, feared, Perchance beloved. The wide world knew his name, His fellow-men knelt to him; yet he died! His name is written for posterity, Who bless or curse his memory, as his deeds Seem good or evil in their partial eyes. He died. The old man, with his snowy hair, His trembling hands, his weak and weary feet, And tottering frame, is ready for the grave. And who is he, who lies outstretched before us? He has beenâ All that we now are who surround his grave; A fair young mother's joy, a father's care, Their hope and pride, a happy cherished child. He, too, has climbed the steep and arduous path Of literary fame with ardent zeal, And eye fixed on the ever-verdant wreath That glory proffers to young Genius' brow. His hopes were high, were realized, or crushedâ It matters nothing now. And he has been The warm and faithful lover. He has known The purest, sweetest passion of the heartâ The bliss of virtuous love, with full returns. She was as faultless as a mortal maid Could be;âas beautiful as aught of earth Has ever been;âas fond as woman's loveâ Her young, confiding, earth-untainted loveâ Has ever proved itself. And he had sense To see her worth; to lock her whole fond heart Safely within his own; to keep untouched The treasure of her confidence in him; And they were wholly happy. That is pastâ Long years ago he laid her in the grave, And all his gladness with her. He has been A kind and tender father. He has seen His sons and daughters at his loved one's breast, In their first infancy; while her bright eye Turned from her babe to him, from him to heaven. He saw them flourish, beautiful and strong, Like olive plants, around his ample board, And poured his thanks to God. Where are they now? Scattered to every climeâsave that grave man, Whose hair is dashed with silver, and who looks With swimming eye down into the deep grave. This is the youngest of the little band That used to gambol round him; yet he stands With children and grandchildren dressed in weeds For this their patriarch father. He has been A father to his people,âhonoured, loved, Consulted, and believed. A nation's heart Has bowed before his virtues. Yet he died!â She died!âthe young, the loved, the beautiful, The wife, the mother died. Fierce agonies Were preying on her vitals. Cruel pangs Racked every nerve; each pulse beat fitfully; Her hands were cold, her eyes were wild and dim, Yet tears were streaming o'er her death-white cheek, Upon the little face that fondly still Was pressed against her bosom. One pale arm, With strong and stiffening grasp was twined around Her sobbing husband's neck, while broken words, Uttered at intervals amidst her pangs, Commend her infant to its father's care; And every word and agonizing look Proved how love triumphs in a woman's heart O'er agony and death; though every throb Was but a death-pang, and its strings were racked With life's last tension, and the blood grew cold, And curdled painfully within its cells, Stillâstill it overflowed with tender care And love toward its treasures. Oh, how high That heart has danced to bliss; what thrilling hopes Have played amongst its young elastic strings, Making joy's melody! Ah, she has been The happy, careless girl, the worshipped bride, The fond expectant mother, with her wealth Of treasured hopes and pictures of high joys Along a sunny future. Andâshe died! Her widowed husband's heart will heal ere long, And find another treasure; and the child, For which her dying heart so agonized, Will never know its loss. Though haply, when Earth's cold reality comes with its blight O'er young life's joyous fancies, it may say, âHad my own mother lived, I should have had One friend at least, and these things had not been.â He died! The miserable vagabond Has found a home at last. No weepers stand Around his open grave, and none inquire What variegated scenes of good and ill His path has led him through; what varied climes His weary pilgrim feet have traversed o'er; How madly he has loved; how bitterly Cold Disappointment, with her iron hand, Has wrung his heartstrings; how Bereavement stood For ever in his path, till manhood's pride Ceased to contend with fate, and he became A hopeless, reckless, houseless fugitive, For Scorn's hard eye to smile at. Yet even then, While braving the proud world, and rushing on To ruin and perdition, one kind word, One look of humid sympathy, could reach The buried spring of feeling in his breast, Which, gushing forth, proclaimed him still a Man! None care for these things. 'Tis enoughâhe died! He died! The feeble infant of an hour Has passed the pangs of death. A few fond hopes Are buried with it, and a mother's heart Alone re-echoes to the wordsâhe died! He died!âShe died!âhas been pronounced of all The by-past human race; and soon these words Will be our sad memorial. We must die Must! There is no reprieve. 'Tis God's decree. All that has life must die, and be dissolved Into its native elements. The form That seems so passing fair, is so beloved, And clings so fondly, by a thousand ties, Around its loved ones, soon will pass away. Is there a heart that will not pause and shrink, Though throbbing e'er so high with hope and joy, When this appalling doom rings through the ear, Along its shivering strings? that will not turn And seek instinctively with shuddering dread Some refugeâsome avenue of escape? But Nature points to none. Her proudest light Could never pierce the loathsome shade of death; Her hand still writes on all thingsâMan must die! Hail glorious light Of Revelation! Brightly beaming forth From the Eternal Mind.âPure Nature, rise! Throw off thy shuddering despondency; Look through this heavenly beam to future lifeâ To realms of blessed immortality, Where pain, and age, and agony, and tears, And death, and parting, never can intrude On that sweet rest, which God through Jesus gives. Read and believe;âWe dieâto live again! A THOUGHT OF GOD. God! Fearful majesty is in the sound Of that dread syllable. The soul bows down At its enunciation, filled with awe, Of Him who is incomprehensible; Who fills immensity, whose name is God; Who is from everlasting, and who knows Nor past, nor future; living through all time, In one eternal now. To whom all space Illimitable is a single point, An ever present here. Immensity Was full of Him, while yet he dwelt alone, The perfect light, life, love, and happiness, Defying diminution or increase. God! who in his omnipotence arose And spake void chaos into solid forms And thin vacuity. God! who in light Went forth, and filled the boundless universe With such a flood of glory that the spheres Awoke, and with adoring melody Commenced the movements of the radiant dance, Of which the mystic mazes, until now They braid, in perfect order, shining each And singing with the splendour and the bliss Caught in that earliest morning of God's light. God! who walked through his universe in life, While vegetation in its myriad forms Sprang from the dust, each catching from the light The hue or softened tint its texture loved. And living creatures, strong and beautiful In sentient life, walked gravely on the earth, Swam in the floods, or floated on the air. God; who in love touched every sentient chord, Attuning them to bliss, so that each thread And fibre of his animated works Felt his exalted touch, and gave its tone To the full chorus of the raptured hymn. Oh, can these finite instruments of praise, By searching, find out God? Can we, whose feet Cleave to our parent-earth, whose utmost stretch Of vision is a point on this small globe, This speck amongst his works; whose longest time Is less than nothing, measured on the scale Of his eternity; whose holiest thoughts Are dim and feeble rays, that struggle forth Into the darkness of a stormy night, From the immortal lamp, that burns within The earthen lantern of mortality:â Shall man in pride presume to search out God, The Everliving, the Omnipotent, The Omnipresent, the creating God, Who keeps the innumerable hosts of worlds All balanced in their orbits, and to whom The smallest creature in the universe Is equally apparent, equally An object of his care, with those great globes That rush, with streaming light and mighty sound, Sweeping wide circles through immensity? Shall man, who seeks in vain to understand How the small ray of God within himself, Communes with the brute matter of his form, Question of God? presuming God within The narrow compass of his feeble mind? Amazing pride of bloated ignorance! That he, who cannot analyze one drop Of summer rain, should think to lay the whole Of the vast ocean with its mysteries So open that an infant's intellect Might count its atoms, comprehend and tell The wonders over which unfathomed depths Have rolled in darkness since the world was made. God has revealed sufficient of himself To fill the intellect he gave and bend The spirit down before him. Let not pride Attempt to climb upon a beam of light Up to the centre of the burning sun, And search its intense nature. Equally Vain and presumptuous is the hope to scan The nature or the perfect ways of God. THE SHIPWRECK. The ship was sweeping homeward in her pride, With white sails swelling o'er the deep green sea, On which the spirits of the moonlight danced In wavering cotillions, to the tones Of glad old ocean's everlasting song The night sat still and silent, 'neath the arch Of her blue airy temple, whence the meek, And deep bright glances of heaven's watchers look On all earth's deeds. Oh! if heaven registers But half the acts they witness, what a score Will blast the conscience of a guilty world, When doomsday's book is opened! But the ship, In majesty of motion riding on, Bore in her bosom many living souls, Of various tempers, fortunes, hopes, and aims. First were the gallant crew. The officers, Each steady to his trust, and well aware That this fair vessel's destiny, the fates Of all on board, depended on their care. The brave tars next, each to his duty true, Stood firmly at his post, or climbed the shroud, Or held the flying tackle; ready still To catch and execute the master's word. These fearless men had whole and noble hearts, That proudly spurned at danger, and they seemed To have no thought or purpose, separate From that fair moving palace. Yet the eye That looks into the spirit, could discern Deep thoughts of home, with its rich holy loves, Playing around their hearts, as silently They paced the deck, or cast along the wave The tender anxious glance, or look toward heaven, With supplication on the sunburnt face. Ah, yes, the roving sailor has a heart; His steel-cased breast is full of tenderness, Which gushes ever at the blessed word, Home. And these were dreaming, sleeping or awake, Of joys and welcomes waiting for them there. Yet one stood gazing o'er the vessel's side, Who had no home in all the joyous earth. He knew not where his infancy was passed, Nor did the image of a mother live Amid the cherished memories of his soul. His earliest recollections hovered round A thin and pale though noble-looking man, Who used to look with fond but restless eye Upon his childish sports; and on his mind A broken dreamy recollection dwelt, Of a confused and agitated scene, When that pale man lay moaning on a couch, And said, as one supported his weak form, âCome, kiss your dying father, Isadore.â And he remembered, too, how he had shrunk With childhood's sobbing terror, from the glance Of a white-headed and hard-featured man, Who sternly said, âBow to your grandfather!â And there were none to love him, none to press The warm fond kiss upon his little brow; To clasp him fondly to affection's breast; To soothe his little woes and guide his sports. And he was lonely, for his spirit lacked The living balsam of parental love, Which heals the wounds that otherwise remain To ache, and fester, and embitter life. So he became a sad and moody boy, Misanthropic e'en from his infancy. And he had been a wanderer on the earth, Displeased, and cavilling at all he met; Distrustful where he might have well relied; Reserved when friendship wooed him; cold and sad Where all around was happiness and joy. One lone bright star had beamed upon his path, For he had loved, had worshipped;âall his heart, Soul, and affections centered round the form Of one fair fragile girl, whose very life Was confidence, and happiness, and love. But death's cold angel snatched her from his breast, And laid her in the bosom of the earth. And now his sighs blent sadly with the breeze, And big bright tears were dropping one by one, Upon the bosom of the cold salt sea, Which feels and heeds them, just as this cold world Feels sorrow's tear, or heeds the bitter drops That she herself wrings from the feeling heart. Slow pacing to and fro, with measured tread, And eye that seemed to study on the deck Some Euclid problem, a rich merchant walked. His brain was busy, not with thoughts of love, Or nature's fond affections; yet he had A sweet and peaceful home, a gentle wife, And children, who were daily asking, âWhen Will our dear father come?â And when the storm Was howling round their dwelling, they would say: âDear mother, does it storm so on the sea?â And then her woman heart would palpitate With all the phantoms of the billowy deep. But his heart was not with them. He has made A prosperous voyage, and his tutored mind Luxuriates in his gains, and he is now Contriving speculations, that shall swell Another hundred-fold, his mammoth wealth. Leaning against a mast, with folded arms, And dark eyes fixed upon the smiling moon, Whose melting light lay cradled with the beams Of sad and tender thought within their depths, A pale youth stood. His treasure and his heart Were far beyond the billows, in the home Of that fair girl, with whom, from infancy, He blended soul and mind. Yet three long years Had ocean billows, with their foamy crests, Heaved fearfully between them, and he felt, Now that he voyaged homeward, all the pangs Of hope, and fear, and fond mortality. Would Laura greet him with a joyous smile, And hide her blushing face upon his breast? And would he find upon her trembling hand The ring he gave at parting? Is she fair, And innocent, and pure, as when they roved The spring-clad hills together? Is her heart Untouched by pride or flattery? Does she love As fondly now as when he kissed the tears From her pale cheek at parting, while her form Shook like an aspen? Or was he no more The loved of her affections? Or had death Proved a dire rival, and made her his bride? Oh! for the strong wings of the gull, to fly And end these agonizing doubts at once. Within the cabin of that fated ship, Beat many an anxious bosom. There was one Who long ago forsook his native land, To woo the goddess Fortune. He had sought, By nights of watching, days of toil and care, Stern self-denial, and the sacrifice Of every generous impulse, to obtain Her gracious golden smile; and he had won The envy-moving treasure; he was rich! And his heart swelled with triumph, as he dwelt Upon the consequence, the lordly pomp, The proud superior air he would assume Amongst his schoolday equals. Oh, how vain! Beside him sat his young and lovely wife, Busied with other thoughts; for she had left Youth's consecrated home, and fond regrets Were shadowing forth the memories of days, And joys, and loved ones, that would never more Come sweetly to her spirit; she had left Her all for one whom she had never loved, Who wooed and won her, as the fowler takes The wild bird in his net, and who would keep His bright-winged pet a captive, to adorn His splendid mansion, and to pour her tones Of mellow sweetness only on his ear. Near them, upon a couch, a feeble girl, With hectic cheek and fever-flashing eye, And soft low moan of pain and weakness, lay. Her mother sat beside her, whose deep sobs Came painfully upon her thrilling ear. âDear mother, do not weep so,â murmured forth The dying maiden; but the mother's grief Became more wild and deep. âOh, Rosabel! My child, my only one! how can I live, And see thee sink and die? Oh, how shall I, To whom thou hast been all in all so long, Exist without thee? When thy gentle voice No more shall greet me, or thy radiant smile Shed sunlight through my heart? What shall I do, When thou requirest my fond care no more, Ay, when thou art no more? Oh, Rosabel, In all my sorrows, thou hast been to me Heaven's gift of consolation. When I knelt Beside thy father's couch, when his thin cheek And sunken eyes were lighted up like thine;â Oh, 'tis the sunset glory of the west, Sure harbinger of darkness!âthen, when first I felt the frailty of all earthly good, And felt my young heart breaking! Oh, that scene! Thine arms were round my neck, and thy red lips Pressed to my forehead, while thy little heart Poured forth its simple soothing, till at length, As wholly heedless of thee, I wept on, Thou laidst thy little hand upon my neck, And sobb'dst out, âMother loved poor Rosa once, But now she will not hear her.â Then I felt 'Twas cruelty to cloud the sunny morn Of childhood with the shadow of my grief, Or tinge thy rich young spirit with the gloom Of death and mourning; and for thy sweet sake, I struggled to support a weary life, Assumed a calm demeanour, ay, and smiled, Lest thy young heart should languish, till at length My soul grew tranquil in reality. And when that scene was past, and I became A widow! then I wore a cheerful mien Above a blighted heart, lest thy young soul Should grow familiar with the tones of wo, And feel the weight of sadness, which bends down The feeling spirit in its early bloom! Oh, I have loved thee solely! and I hoped That thou wouldst solace my declining years;â But it is over nowâa few days more It may be mine to watch the waning light Of thy pure spirit; then the sea! the sea!â I cannot yield thee! Oh, the ocean grave!ââ âDear mother, do not, I beseech thee, weep So bitterly. What boots the marble tomb, Or grave of earth? The wave will just as well Conceal the loathsomeness of flesh's decay; I care not where my worn-out garment lies. Do, mother, banish these afflicting thoughts, And look away to heaven. There's comfort thereâ Rich consolation and eternal peace. âMy soul is grateful for the love and care Which thou hast lavished on me, and which I Can never now return, since every day Makes my debt greater and my means more scant. Dear mother, be content to let me go A little while before thee. Look to God; He will not leave his children comfortless.â Who interrupts the sobbing parlance now? A meagre-looking, tearful little girl Advances, with a timid courtesy,â âMadam,â she said, âyou weep, and you can feel For my poor mother's sorrow. Come, I pray, And look upon her; she is very ill.â âGo with her, mother;â whispered Rosabel, âThe Lord perchance has sent her to divert The selfish current of our bitterness.â Deep in the ship's side, in a wretched berth, Was laid the mother of that hapless child, Writhing and groaning with a fierce disease. Her husband left his country for the land Of equal rights, three weary years before; And he had gained a comfortable home For his dear wife and child, and they were now Upon their voyage to rejoin him there. His heart was yearning to embrace once more The idol of his young and faithful love, To clasp the sweet child, who in infancy Sat cooing on his knee, or twined his neck So lovingly with her soft little arms; While Mary spread the neat but humble board. His heart was masculine; it did not dwell, Like woman's, on the dangers of the sea, O'er which his loved ones journeyed. Could he now Have stood beside that berth, how had his hopes And glad heart-beatings died in pain away. The murmuring widow gazed upon the scene; And her heart smote her as she looked upon Affliction so much bitterer than her own. Beside that sufferer's bed no gentle friend Stood, prompt to do the ministry of love; And that poor little child, whose trembling hand Held the cold water up to her parched lips, Oh, how her sobs of childish agony Convulsed the mother's heart! âOh, Emeline! Who will protect thee?âwho will comfort thee, And lead thee to thy father?â she exclaimed. âI will protect thy child,â the widow said, âAnd serve thee to the utmost of my power.â âMy God, I thank thee! Thou hast heard my voice, My cares are all removed,âI die in peace!â In her own cabin, heedless of these scenes Of death and sorrow, lay a simple maid, Weeping in bitterness the night away, Ay, supplicating heaven for death's relief. Yet neither pain nor sickness agonized Her youthful person, and she was possessed Of riches, beauty, dear and gentle friends. What then was her affliction? Why the child Had listened to the flatteries of a man, Whom her young heart deemed faultless, for he seemed Disinterested, generous, noble-souled, And so devotedâcould she doubt his truth? Then he was handsome, graceful, and genteel; Her eye was dazzled, and her simple heart Quite captivated; and she thought that earth Had not another like him, or held aught That could compensate for her loss of him. Her father saw him in another light; A libertine, a base, designing knave, A fortune-hunter, a low grovelling soul, The old man's keen and well-experienced eye Discovered him to be. He loved his child, And sought to save her from the bitter years Of bootless, keen repentance and distress. This was the sorrow that so frenzied her. Screened by the damask curtains of her bed, A lady, her companion, knelt in prayer. She knew affliction; she had been abroad With her young husband, who went forth to seek The restoration of his shattered health. But all her cares and watchings had been vain, And her last hope was to conduct him home, That he might look on his own land once more, And sleep within its bosom. But the Lord Had otherwise determined. She had watched All the long lonely night beside his couch, Still prompt to minister and soothe his pain, And she had closed the eyes from which her soul Had drank the purest, sweetest happiness Of earth's affection; and she then composed, For the last time, those black and glossy curls, Which she so loved to comb and to arrange Upon his noble brow. And she had seen That form, so beautiful, so much beloved, Sink down to the low caverns of the deep, For ever, from her sight. Oh, that was grief; And she wept wildly, for she did not boast That fortitude which some admire so much, But which exists with apathy alone. Feeling will gush; no high, no proud resolve Can choke the utterance of the gushing heart. And Emma wept, but she forgot not God. She wept with resignation, and poured out The humble breathing of a broken heart; And He who shook her idol from its throne, Gave her the presence of a God instead, And she bowed down and worshipped. Other sounds Than voice of grief, or prayer, or dying pain, Rose on the night air from that gallant bark. Forth from the cabin swelled the patriot song, With loud and stirring chorus, as the bowl, Which makes the dastard brave, went freely round. Card-tables there, and dice, and chess, were spread; And sleight-of-hand and secret villany Defrauded the poor dupes who vainly thought That hoodwinked fortune had presided there; And oaths and imprecations fierce and loud Burst from hot lips, which, ever and anon, Were bathed in flashing wine, and cursed alike Success or disappointment. Oh, great God! That fearful shock; that wild and shrieking cry That sprang at once toward heaven from all on board, As the broad bottom of that plated hull Struck on the lurking reef! Another shock! âWe are all lost!â exclaimed a shrieking voice, Which pierced the cabins with its knell of death; And one wild swell of horror and despair Swept o'er each pausing heart, and washed away All sense of other wo. Ha! where had fled The deep and varied passions, that but now Held strong dominion in those awe-struck breasts? Death!âDeath is present! What availeth now The home that waits the wanderer, with its smiles, And warm embrace of love? What boots it now To the warped heart of the misanthrope, That life is not all sunlight? Gloriously Breaks forth its parting beam. Oh, earth is fair! And life is sweet, now that Eternity Comes booming on the wavesâsweeping away All but the bare reality of things. Who now is brooding over luckless love? Who reckons up, and glories in his gains? Who thinks of pale consumption and disease? Who dwells with sad regretful memories Of loved ones, who have passed the cold dark porch Of the eternal city, at whose gates They all stand shuddering? Where is now the flush Of the wine fever? Where the vivid glow Of proud success? Where has the dark hue fled Which gushes from the baffled writhing heart Up to the gambler's brow? Each cheek is pale, And every spirit passionless and faint With cold death-sickness. Through the shattered hull The wild relentless waters rushed and roared, As the fierce armies of the olden time Rushed shouting through the breaches in the wall Of some proud kingly city. To the boats! All life's fond hopes are with them! and Despair To that frail refuge turned her piercing eyesâ But they were filled, and paddled from the wreck, And layâaghast with terror, as it wereâ Watching the fearful issue. Even those Who proved victorious in the fearful strife To reach the boatsâeven they, with wide still eyes Looked back upon the death whose certainty They hardly had eluded. While their loved And loving ones shrieked, with extended arms, To them for succourâwhile it seemed that heaven Could not now save them. Every buoyant thing From off those decks now rides upon the wave, Each freighted with a life; and God alone Can see the sharp and varied agonies Of those half-frantic souls, that cling to life, Even on the icy bosom of Despairâ Or those that still remain upon the wreck. Yet even here, amid these fearful scenes, Peace lay beneath the brooding wing of death. Ay, even here was peace, the peace of God, Which nature seeks in vain to comprehend; It passes understanding, and pervades The humble souls which glow with love divine. Yes, in that vessel were some humble souls, To whom death came in angel loveliness,â A messenger of mercy. Staid and calm Their hearts were beating, and their eyes were raised, With holy hope and confidence, toward heaven. âThy will be done,â they murmured,âwhile a yell Of deep fierce agony swelled madly up, As closed the waters o'er that peopled ship, And down! down! down! it sunk, to the dark bed Of the hoarse moaning waves. The scene is closed.â The winds, and sea, and sky, are still and bright, And nature looks all glorious, as the morn Comes gladly forth, as if no heart was cold, No spirit broken, no bright eye sealed up In ever-during darkness,ânone consigned To wet and weary watching for the form It never more will rest on. These shall mourn As if nor light nor joy remained on earth; Yet nature, with her melody and bloom, Shall hold her course rejoicing, no more moved That his proud ship is lost, than if a swarm Of painted insects had been swept away By chilly night-winds. Even the mourners' heartsâ Ay, these will cease to throb. Oh, earth! Oh, life! Who could endure your ills, your bitter pangs, Your heartless apathy and fickleness, With the eternal shipwreck of your hopes, But for the steady light of Faith, which beams Upon the Holy Page, reflecting thence Hope, peace, and consolation, which no gloom Amongst the shadows of this opaque earth Can ever quench! Oh! not the cloud that lies O'er death's lone valley, or the fearful shade That wraps the impenetrable eve of Time, And hides the dayspring of Eternity, Can cloud the beam of Faith. Oh! gloriously 'Twill light the spirit, in the dreadful wreck Of this stupendous shipâthe peopled earth. TO A BROKEN TULIP. It is not for thee that I weep, Thou beautiful perishing flower, Though I've watched thy bright bud, since I first saw it peep, The loveliest gem in my bower. It is not for thee that I mourn, Though spoilers have broken thy stem, And crushed on the earth the rich robes thou hast worn, And trampled thy bright diadem. But thou, my poor perishing flower, With treasures of dying perfume, Hast gathered around, with a magical power, The memories that dwell in the tomb. Their voices are sweet to mine ear, Though sad as the dove's dying moan, Their hands and their eyes are surpassingly dear, And bright lips that whisper âMy own.â I seek with a thrill of delight To clasp the dear shades to my heart, Then with eyes dim and closed, cheeks and lips cold and white, In coffins and shrouds, they depart. I clasp my hands then, and I weepâ As I wept when we parted at first,â When the dear ones went down to the long lonely sleep, And anthems pealed forthâDust to dust! Alas! for his pitiless powers, Whose palace of state is the tomb; Who breaks down the dearest, and loveliest flowers, And gathers them into the gloom. 'Tis piteous to see the young head Bow down, when life's stamen is broke; 'Tis mournful to breathe the sweet incense they shed, As meekly they yield to the stroke. But lo! a bright Conqueror stands Amid the rapt seraphs above; And sweet buds and blossoms, in beautiful bands, Rejoice in the light of his love. He hath rifled the palace of death,â He hath borne the pale flowers from the gloom; They live in his presence, a beautiful wreath, Immortal in fragrance and bloom. THE ANGEL OF THE PAST. When fainting in life's desert way, The weary heart sits down to rest, Afflicted, wrung, and desolate, With bitter ills oppressed; When cold chill mildews of despair Upon the lonely spirit creep; When Hope forgets her ministry, And turns away to weep; The pale sweet Angel of the Past, With dewy eye, and drooping mien, Comes o'er the naked wild to cast Her tableau vivant scene. Grouped by her Witch-of-Endor hand, They come, a fair and smiling train, From every bright and pleasant land Through which our path has lain. Memories from Friendship's blessed vale, Proffer again the dear caress; But in the background stand Deceit, Or cold Forgetfulness. Shadows from Love's delightful bowers, With red-rose wreaths and golden lyres, Present their precious offerings, And touch their altar fires. But Sorrow, with her sable-train, The coffin, shroud, and rigid clay, Pass slow before the joyous group;â We groan, and turn away. Thus gather all the hopes and joys, That dazzled and deceived our youth; But now upon them, cold and clear, Lies the stern light of Truth. At length appears a radiant train,â Memories of childhood pure and sweet; On brow and breast there is no stain, No soil upon their feet. They seek no wealth beyond the flowers That live beside the valley brook; That on the mountain make their bowers, Or in some rocky nook. They ask no joys, but such as live In love around a father's hearth; They worship only God in heaven, And mother upon earth. Their gentle voices are more sweet Than softest songs of summer birds; And flattery, sorrow, and deceit Are never in their words. TO THE MEMORY OF T. W. WHITE, LATE EDITOR OF THE SOUTHERN LITERARY MESSENGER. And has the Southern Muse no votive wreath To lay upon thy tomb? No pensive lyre, A living requiem to thy name to breathe, Long as the winds of heaven shall wake the wire? Shall Southern genius build for thee no tomb From her rich treasury of native gems? Shall Southern kindness braid no funeral crown, From her rich wilderness of flow'ring stems? Oh, ardent friend and lover of the Muse? Generous embalmer of her native lay, Thou, who didst never falter or refuse To aid young Genius in her upward way! Thou of the kindly heart, the generous breast, The spirit willing every wo to share; The grass is green above thy place of rest, And none has laid a grateful offering there! The Muse thou fosteredst, could she weave no lay, To drape with honour thy last resting-place? The land thou lovedst, could she bring no bay Of evergreen and tear-gemmed memories? I never heard thy voice, or saw thy face, But I have proved thy friendship; and my hand Has wreathed these pale flowers of the wilderness, With living laurel of this Northern land; And I have brought my offering, with its dew, From the deep fountain of a stricken heart; To which thy warm and generous nature knew The holy balm of friendship to impart. Oh, let my tribute lie above thy breast;â Could thy cold heart but feel the balmy flowers!â Far holier garlands in the Land of Rest Shed round thy spirit now their blissful powers. THE DYING SOLDIER. Night gathers slowly round me; the long night Of darkness and of death. Within mine eye The light of life is fading, as the day Is slowly melting from the darkening sky. See, from the wood that borders this foul plain, Creep slowly forth the shadows; night is there, And her dim hosts march slowlyâslowly on,â So silentlyâOh, terrible they are! All forms of darkness, doubt, and mystery, Sad, hideous, and fantastic, form that wreath Of cold black horror. Oh, I feel it now! It stifles my warm soul,âit cramps my breath; The red blood flows no longer from my wound,â I feel the warm tide trickle down no more; There is no pain, but oh, an iciness, A horrid stiff'ning of the curdling gore, More terrible than all the agonies That have convulsed me since I weltered here; It is not ease or sleep. Oh, Death! thou soul Of darknessâthou embodiment of fearâ How nature doth abhor thy cold embrace, And cling to life's warm bosom. Life! oh, life! Though thou art passion, weariness, and pain, We cling to thee with agonizing strife. I would prolong thy parting bitterness; I gasp to taste once more thy warm sweet breath; But icy daggers pierce my vitals through,â My brain grows torpid with the weight of death. Yet I shall live for ever in the light Of my proud country's glory! and my grave Shall be a holy altar, where the free Shall celebrate the worship of the brave. And this is death in glory! with the wreath Of victory's laurel fresh upon my brow; Oh, ardently I sought for such a death; Life! life!âoh for thy humblest station now! Oh, for the blessings I have thrown away,â Warm being, with its pulses of delight, Its tendrils of delicious sympathy, Embracing all the beautiful and bright. Its clinging thrilling loves. Oh, Geraldine, The blissful bands that hold thee to my heart, Now shivering with intensest agony Of painful tension, cannot, cannot part. Death hath no power to rend those holy ties; The bonds of our communion must remain, To change the blessed intercourse of bliss Which has been ours, to cold and lingering pain. Our hearts are wedded, and for ever more Must nestle to each other. Wo to thine, Doomed in its young warm tenderness to bear The icy and death-stricken weight of mine. The mysteries of love are now revealed, The preciousness of life, the priceless worth Of its enjoyments.âOh, for warmth, for light, For strength, once more to range the glorious earth! Oh, for the hope of immortality, The humble Christian's hope of life to come! Of friendship, love, and joy, all purified, And bound in wreaths of never-fading bloom. The veriest slave who feels that blessed hope, Hath life eternal flowing round his heart; Round mine now closes black and crushing iceâ Doubt, horror!âDeath! oh, terrible thou art! CALISTA. Yes, thou art gone down to the still, cold grave To hide thy broken heart. The dim-eyed world Says, that consumption drank the fountain dry Of thy young joyous life. Well, be it so! That world would scoff, perhaps, if it should know The hidden agony that burned away Thy spirit's silver spring, and left thy heart, Thy woman-heart, to waste by sure decay, Till, like a lily withered at the root, Thou droopedst to the earth. Consumption! Ay, Came the destroyer ever unto her, Who wore within her heart no secret grief? Oh, woman, woman! if thy history Were written by th' impartial pen of truth, The world would start away in dumb surprise From the revealings of the agonies Which thou hast borne in silence, while they gnawed Thy heart away, and fed upon thy brain Like fiery vipers, or consumed away Thy very soul within thee! Thy young heart, My poor Calista, was an open book to me, From our glad childhood. Every throb, And wish, and feeling, pleaded unto me For sympathy and shelter; and the doom That parted us in girlhood was like death. The paper missive passing to and fro, And burdened with the yearnings of the soul, Still formed a chain between us, but alas! How cold is such communion to the hearts That long to give each other throb for throb In love's unchecked embrace; while full deep eyes Pour forth the treasures of each ardent soul, In language that needs not the form of words, But is itself the eloquence of truth. Thy spirit was so formed for confidence, It could not live without a present friend, With whom it might commingle every tone Of its wild melody. And there was one Whose spirit seemed attuned to blend with thine Every harmonious tone. He seemed like thee, Pensive and pious, intellectual; All poetry, and gentleness, and love. He called thee sister, and was unto thee All that the fondest brother could have been; And thou didst lean on him confidingly, And listen to the dreamy sophistries Of âpure platonic love.â Ah me, that dream Of passionless affection! Many a heart Has trusted in it, and awoke too late, Pierced through with many sorrows. Earnestly I gave my warning. But the heartâthe heart! When did it list to reason? 'tis so sweet To rest the heart in perfect confidence On one that feels and feeds its sympathies With fond devotion; and to deem that flame, Burning in earthen censers, high and pure As the devotion of the raptured love That wreaths its incense in the spirit-land. Such love is pure, but 'neath its placid tideâ Ah, poor humanity!âa current runs, Silent and strong, which the heart recks not of, Till it is undermined, and borne away Wrecked and undone for ever. So it was With thee, Calista. Placid were thy dreams As the sweet bird's, who sings herself to sleep, Where trembling radiance of the evening star Illumes the pinions of the summer winds, That kiss the fragrant flowers and rock her nest. As breaks upon the slumber of that bird The voice of the tornado, as he bends His black breast on the forest, with a crash That makes earth shudder, while his sounding wings Strike the strong trees to splinters, as aghast, Wounded and helpless, rest and desolate, She flutters to the earth in agony,â So to Calista came from Henry's lips The wordsââI loveânot with a brother's love, But passionately, with a burning heart, One whom I long have known, who will be mine In wedlock's holy bondage. A few days, And I will bring a sister to your arms, And we shall be so happy.â So it wasâ Here was the secret of the holy love, The placid tenderness, the platonism, That bound him to Calista. His young heart, With its wild flood of passion, had been given Unto another ere he saw her face; And she had been to him a sweet relief To absence, doubt, and sorrow, while her heart And soul, and being, mingled into his, With holy worship of a maiden's love, Guiltless of passion,till that fatal word, âI love another,â opened to her view The deep springs of her heart. She could have lived For ever happy in her gentle dream Of pure fraternal love, if Henry's heart Had owned no other. But to hear him say, âRejoice, sweet spirit-sister! for the maid Whom I have loved so many weary years With passionate devotion, is mine own.â Oh, 'twas too deadly bitter to her soul! Yet still she smiledâthat smile which woman's pride Throws o'er the ruin of a broken heart, Like sunlight flitting o'er a sepulchre. Of what could she complain? He was not false; He never sought the love that she had given;â So in the deep recesses of her soul, She hid her shame and sorrow, and stood by, While to another he pledged earnestly All that she valued or desired on earth. But from that day she drooped, fading away Like summer twilight, which goes sweetly out, With dying melody and closing flowers, Into the world of sleep. Around her bier The weepers stood, and chided at the fate Which gave so lovely and beloved a maid To pitiless consumption. JESUS, FRIEND OF SINNERS! Jesus, friend of sinners! see in adoration Low at thy footstool I bend down before thee, Praising thy mercy for the blest permission Thus to adore thee. Jesus, friend of sinners! give me grace to offer Such an oblation as thou canst approve of, Even my fervent penitent affections, Laid on thine altar. Jesus, friend of sinners! 'grave upon my spirit, While I bow down imploringly before thee, That the unholy cannot look upon thee, Throned in thy mercy. Jesus, friend of sinners! let me not approach thee Hiding my sins like nestlings in my bosom, Crying for mercy, while I feel their writhings Torture my spirit. Jesus, friend of sinners! take away my idols; Help me to look upon them with abhorrence, Then pour in mercy on my bleeding bosom, Thy consolation. Jesus, friend of sinners! keep me ever near thee; Save me from sin, the source of keenest sorrows; Grant me the peace that passes understanding, Now and for ever. TO THE BANNER OF THE CROSS. Ay, lift the banner high, And let it stream afar; While on it rests the radiancy Of Bethlehem's holy star. Embroider on its field âThe Spirit's peaceful Dove,â Defended by the ample shield Of perfect fervent Love. Upon its border write âHoliness to the Lord!â While all its folds, in lines of light Display his written word. Ay, raise the banner high, The Banner of the Cross! Beneath which, earth is vanity, And all its treasures dross. March on, from sea to sea, And o'er the isle-set wave, Till all the human family Know Him, who came to save!â Till every spirit feels Devotion's sacred flame, Till every living creature kneels To our Redeemer's name; Till heedless of earth's fame, Her avarice and her pride, We glory but in Jesus' name, In Christ, the crucified. Then lift his banner high, And pray, thy kingdom come; 'Tis crowned with joy and victory, He leads his armies home. THE HUNTER. The weary hunter paused upon the hill What time the sun lay smiling in the west; The winds were sleeping, and the mountain rill Seemed lingering in the silent bowers to rest. He doffed his cap, and wiped his sunburnt brow, Leaned on his gun, and scanned the scene around; His noble dog approached him, crouching low, And lay down wearily upon the ground. 'Twas autumn, and the forests were arrayed In kingly costume, purple and bright gold; While here and there, a deep green cluster stayed, And lingering flowers their fragrant silks unrolled. Ripe nuts were strewn profusely on the ground, Tall trees were bending 'neath the clustered vine, Even rugged rocks with berried garlands crowned, Could boast their blessing from the hand Divine. The hunter looked to heaven with humid eye, Then sat him down upon the mountain's brow, And gazed, with drooping mien and many a sigh, Upon the pleasant vale that lay below. âTwelve years!ââhe said at lengthââoh! what a change Twelve years have wrought in this soft vale and me; The very spot I called my own is strange,â I look in vain e'en for my favourite tree. âOh, happy were the seasons when I roved A careless boy along that river's side; And happier far, when with the maid I loved, I watched the moonlight trembling on the tide; âOr marked young love's pure spirit on her face, Weaving his rosy garland of delight, Where neither grief or care had left a trace, Or crossed one joy-beam with the shade of night. âThere stands the noble elm that threw its shade So many summers at my father's door; Its limbs are broken now, its heart decayed, And the green foliage crowns its head no more. âAnd she who loved me with a mother's love, Who 'neath that elm-tree sung her lullaby, From that loved home, long since compelled to rove, I saw her in a land of strangers die. âThose black and crumbling ruins mark the spot Of my own household hearth, my blessed home Of treasures that can never be forgot, While in the wilderness of life I roam. âThere's happiness in that rich valley now, And glad hearts cluster round each household stone, While, I, a lone thing on the mountain's brow, Have neither house or hearth to call my own. âOh, desolation! how thine icy seal Lies like a leaden tomb upon my breast, Crushing a heart, no balm can soothe or heal; Wearing a spirit that can never rest.â He paused, and bowed his face upon his knee, And his clasped hands dropped listless from his brow, While big tears fell so slow and silently, As from the fountain of a deep-felt wo. Poor Ponto, wondering why his master grieves, Licks kindly from his hand the falling tears;â Hark! There's a distant rustle of the leaves, The dog starts forward, and erects his ears. The practised hunter soon detects the sound, And his keen eye is watching for the game, When from the cover of a verdant mound, Amid the clustering greens, an object came. He raised his trusty rifle to his eye,â A spotted fawn appears; the hills resound; What means that wild and agonizing cry? A human creature has received the wound. With terror wild he hastened to the place, And there, apparently in death, was laid A young and lovely girl of Indian race, In fawnskin mantle tastefully arrayed. He stooped to aid her, but she shrank away, And shrieked and struggled with intense alarms, Till, overcome with fear and agony, She hid her face, and fainted in his arms. âOh, I have murdered her!â the hunter said, As o'er his arm her head drooped languidly; And her rough mantle, falling back, displayed Her arms and bosom, white as ivory. Rich curls of bright brown hair were clustered round Her polished shoulder, where the warm red blood Was leaping from a wide and rugged wound, Like the impetuous gushing of a flood. He probed its depth, and his despairing heart Leaped up, as hope awoke amid his fears; The girl revived, as he essayed his art To staunch her blood and soothe away her fears. And like the captured fawn, that artless maid Soon ceased to fear her captor, spoke and smiled, And poured her thanks for his assiduous aid, With all the simple fervour of a child. âThy heart is like the red man's heart,â she said; âIt melts with pity for a helpless maid, So when the warriors of my people bled, The tomahawk above my brow was stayed; âAnd Wonah bore me in his arms away To the bright border of the silver lake; And I was happy there, oh, many a day,â Yet sometimes then my little heart would ache, âWith misty memories of a lovely vale, And tall flowers clustering on a river's side, Fair fruit-trees bending to the fragrant gale, And cultured fields, and meadows smooth and wide; âAnd of a dwelling, where a gentle one, With soft blue eyes, smiled ever on my play, And soothed my sorrow with such balmy tone, Who nursed, and watched, and taught me, night and day; âAnd of a scene of tumult, blood, and fire, A hideous mingling of shouts, shrieks, and groans; I saw my dear and gentle nurse expire, And heard my name amid her latest moans. âThen I was borne away.â The maiden ceased, The hunter's hand had clutched with sudden clasp A bracelet, which her perfect arm embraced,â Gazed on it, and sunk back with deathlike gasp. Alarmed, she raised his head upon her knee, And warm tears fell like rain-drops on his brow, A trembling hope,which panted fearfully, Was waking in her heaving bosom now. âMy child! my own sweet child!â the hunter cried. âOh, God be praised, that thou art spared to me! His Providence has been thy guard and guide, For he alone could have protected thee. âHow cam'st thou hither, angel of my life, To meet thy wandering father, who has come To weep above the ashes of his wife, And mourn above his desolated home?â âFather! I could not wed the Indian chief, Though he has been my brother, kind and true; I could not bear to see his bitter grief; I fled, and God directed me to you.â âAnd blessed be his name. By yon fair flood,â The hunter said, âI'll build my bower again, Plant my young rose-tree, where her mother stood, And in its balmy shade forget my pain. âAh, little thought I, when love's diadem Was torn by savage warriors from my brow, That their rough hands had saved the precious gem Which sheds such blessed radiance o'er me now.â TO ANNA ?. Shall that light heart, that bounds to joy, Be ever sad and dreary? And can that brilliant, laughing eye, Be downcast, wet, and weary? Oh, can the hopes that swell thy breast, Be wholly wrecked and broken? And shalt thou seek in vain for rest, Where words of peace are spoken? Ah! shall thy brilliant beauty be Like some poor broken flower, That droops its fair head piteously Beneath the driving shower? Alas! that such should be thy doom, And none to sorrow o'er thee! Yet many a bright and fragrant bloom Has died unwept before thee. Oh, who would rob us of the faith That smooths the path of sorrow, And cheers the night of pain or death With promise of to-morrow? Oh, wring my soul, or wreck my peace, Or make me broken-hearted; But leave untouched my hopes of bliss, When life's frail strings are parted. THE HOUR OF PRAYER. 'Tis now the hour of prayer,â The world is still and calm, And all the trembling air Is like a cloud of balm; From valley, plain, and hill, No busy voices come; The flocks and herds are still, The labourer is at home. The moon in holy light Walks down the spangled sky, The dewy leaves are bright Beneath her radiant eye; The birds, that all the day Made field and forest ring, Sleep each upon his spray, With head beneath the wing. Even childhood's voice of joy Is bound in sweet control, And dreams of bliss employ The young and harmless soul. No sound is on the air, To tempt the mind astray;â In such an hour of prayer How sweet it is to pray! No thoughts of sorrow now Exert their dark control; The moon shines on the brow, And peace is in the soul; No weight is on the mind, In this sweet hour of prayer; The world is left behind, With all its chains of care. How blessed now to kneel All humbly on the sod; To look to heaven and feel The presence of our God; To feel the spirit melt With love's redeeming ray, From Him who often knelt In night's calm hour to pray;â To feel the Spirit of grace, With soft mysterious sway, Shed o'er the soul that peace, Which nought can take away. Oh! sweet indeed it were, With such communion blest, At this calm hour of prayer To pass to endless rest. WINTER. The Winter has come from the dark wild caves In the barren hills of the dreary North, Where the sea lies bound in his frozen waves, And the snows of eternity shroud the earth. Realms that the sunlight has never seen, Where brood the pinions of endless night, Save where the borealean sheen Waves her wild banners of lurid night. Where the ice with the snow-drifts from the bowers, Where the weary-winged tempests retire to sleep, And the hoar frost spangles the waste with flowers, Fairer than any where night dews weep. There Winter asserts his eternal reign, In the terrible gloom, for his spirit meet; And hither he sends on a long campaign His forces of hurricane, snow, and sleet. The Summer has fled to the land of flowers, Where the verdure is budding the whole year long; And the sweet birds live in the changeless bowers, And carol an everlasting song;â Where the blossoms are heavy with honey dew, And the fruits with their nectar juices swell; Where Plenty and Beauty profusely strew Their richest of gifts, like a magic spell;â The Zephyrs have gone to that land of love, With the hues and the scents of our leaves and flowers; The beautiful birds of our summer groves Are resting their wings in those blessed bowers. All desolate now is the field and wood, Late glowing with beauty, and voiced with love, And Winter has prisoned the hymning flood, Spread snow-drifts around us, and clouds above. Oh! for the joys of our summer hours, When the earth was all fair, and the sky serene, When pleasures were sporting in balmy bowers, Like butterflies spangling a fairy scene. Oh! for the days that will come no more, The days of summer, of song, and glee, When sunlight gladdened the sea and shore, And lay in its brightness on you and me. Oh! is there no South, where the light of peace And summer of happiness may endure; No land, where the beauty so brief in this, May bloom to eternity fair and pure? Yes, there is a country where living streams Through bowers of blessedness ever glide, Where love may embody its holiest dreams, And beauty immortal and bliss abide. Then why, in the winter of pain and wo, Cling wailing around the pale buds of time, When even the sparrow and wild-dove know The way to a beautiful summer clime? SPRING. âEarth breaks forth into singing;â for the Spring, So like an infant with its angel smile, Reclines upon her bosom, and the sun Looks lovingly upon her, and his gifts Of joy and beauty deck her gloriously. Behold the bright green mantle, rich with flowers Of every form and hue, which he has thrown So bounteously around her!âSee the plumes Of leafy beauty, of a thousand shades, Red, brown, and yellow, mingled here and there With silvery clusters of the trembling asp, All merging to the pale and tender green Of the advancing foliage of the Spring! The diamond waters sparkle in rich chains Upon her bosom, mingling with her wreaths; And music, from a thousand living bells, Gushing in chorus to the sacred song Which winds and waters chaunt continually To Him who gave them voices. Look abroad!â All life is full of gladness. See the sports Of the young innocents!âBehold the joy Of fond maternal hearts, of speechless things, To which Spring brings the younglings! Beautiful, And sweet, and thankful; full of songs and bliss The wide earth seemeth now. The placid heaven Bends over, as if gazing with delight And listening joyously. Gracefully now The white cloud veils the azure, and bright drops From the dark fringe are falling, as if heaven Looked on the fair earth, as a mother looks Upon her happy children, with soft tears Upon her smiling beauty, as she feels That there must come a day when all this joy And tender beauty will have passed away. The air is gently flowing o'er the earth, Like living waves of melody and balm, Laving her gems of every splendid tint, Which give back every kiss, with incense sigh. Earth, air, and waterâall is melody, And light, and balm, and beauty. How unlike The cold white drifts, dark clouds, and piercing winds That formed the train of Winter! Who has wrought This glorious change? Who sent the gentle Spring To wake and warm the silent frozen earth, And deck her thus in beauty? Who attuned The wild bird's song of love? Who wove the flowers, And touched their wondrous texture with rich hues, As if the glorious arch o'er which the shower Pursues his sounding march, what time the sun Looks on the triumph of his streaming plumes, Had melted in the beam, and every gem That glittered in the arch had found a home, A calm, sweet home of love, within the breast Of its own chosen blossom? Who has brought From tomb and winding-sheet, in which the worm Lay powerless, sightless, senseless, seemingly Inanimate, these splendid butterflies, Which look as if their wings and velvet coats Were braided of the brightest tints of earth, Dipped in the radiance of the sunny heaven? It is Jehovah!âHe who framed the earth, And all the worlds that fill infinityâ Who wrought the mystery of the human mind, And gives it food for all its godlike powers, In this profusion of his glorious works, This treasury of beauty, melody, Fragrance, and glory, and intelligence, From man, in his perfection, to the least Of living things which float upon one ray Of the diffusive sunlight. Oh, it seems To fill the soul, and bring it near to God, In this soft springtime to observe his hand In each awakening blessing; and to muse Upon that spring when we shall all awake, Changed, like the worms that burst their tombs, to float On wings of glory o'er the spring-clad earth, Upon the balmy breezes. Then shall death Be âswallowed up in victory.â Then shall He Who walked the darkest pathway to the tomb, And wrenched away its black and massive bars, And burst its bonds asunder, call his own From out the shattered prison. Then shall rise A glorious Anthem of immortal songs, To Him who is the Sunlight of this Spring Of Everlasting Life. COME TO THE WOODS. Come to the woods in June, 'Tis happiness to rove When Nature's lyres are all in tune, And life all full of love. Come, when the morning light, Advancing from afar, Veils, with a glory soft and bright, Her smiling favourite star. While from the dewy dells, And every wild-wood bower, A thousand little feathered bells Ring out the matin hour. Come, when the sun is high, And earth all full in bloom, When every passing summer sigh Is languid with perfume;â When by the mountain brook The watchful red-deer lies; And spotted fawns, in mossy nook, Have closed their wild, bright eyes;â While from the giant tree, And fairy of the sod, A dreamy wind-harp melody Speaks to the soul of God, Whose beauteous gifts of love, The passing hours unfold, Till e'en the sombre hemlock boughs Are tipped with fringe of gold. Come, when the sun is set, And see along the west Heaven's glory, streaming through the gate By which he passed to rest. While brooklets, as they flow Beneath the cool sweet bowers, Sing fairy legends, soft and low, To groups of listening flowers; And creeping formless shades Make distance strange and dim, And with the daylight softly fades The wild bird's evening hymn. Come, when the woods are dark, And winds go fluttering by, While here and there a phantom bark Floats in the deep blue sky; While gleaming far away Beyond th' aerial flood, Lies in its starry majesty The city of our God. Come to the dim path now, 'Tis sweet to wander long, With spirit mingling in the flow Of lone Edoleo's song. No human heart is near, To give us sigh for sigh, But blending with the living air, Sweet spirits hover nigh. Softly they bid us kneel Upon the mossy sod, Then, smiling, draw aside the veil That shuts the soul from God. Come to the forest now, If thou art fair and gay,â Here are bright chaplets for thy brow, And songs of love all day. Come, if thy heart is lone, Here are pale wreaths for thee, Soft twilight, and the soothing tone Of nature's melody. Come, if thy soul is wrung And feels the need of grace, Soft voices, the dark woods among, Say, God is in this place! THE SISTER TO THE BRIDE. Sister! my dear, my only one! And has the moment come, In which thou for a stranger's love Wilt leave thine early home? Ah, sister, in this home of thine There lives a fount of love, So deep, so pure, thou canst not hope Its like on earth to prove. A mother's and a sister's love,â Ah, thou may'st seek in vain To find in this cold selfish world Such holy love again. Man cannot love as woman loves, His stern and haughty soul Knows not the gentle sympathies, And spurns e'en love's control. There is in man a principle Which ever seeks its own; Unselfish love has made its nest In woman's heart alone. Could he be blessed without her love, Her tenderness and care, She might appeal to him in vain, However fond or fair. My sister, thou must henceforth make Thy husband's will thy bliss, Nor hope for happiness or peace, Or honour, but in his. My words are truth; though haply he To whom thy heart is given Has taught thee to expect with him The happiness of heaven. Alas! for such as hope to find A Paradise below, Where e'en the sweetest, fairest flowers On thorny branches grow. Where e'en if heaven should ever smile O'er flowers of deathless bloom, Ourselves must change, and pale, and fade, And ripen for the tomb. While cruel fiends are ever near To steal or blight our joy, Where strong disease and death will come, Our treasures to destroy. This life, with all its tinsel joys, Is but a weary round, In which no bright and holy spot Save childhood's home is found. Yet, sister, there's a talisman, Which, worn within thy breast, Will keep thy spirit calm and pure, And give thee peace and rest. 'Tis meek Religion's precious gift; Oh, be the treasure thine; All other lustres time may dim,â This hath a light divine. With chastened hopes and pure desires, To God supremely given, This world is beautiful, and love A bliss allied to heaven. Go forth, then, in thy bridal joy, I would not have thee sad; Hope whispers that thy life shall be Contented, bright, and glad. Go forth, and be thy happiness Calm, rational, and deep; I would not thou shouldst ever think Of girlhood's home and weep. Yet, sister, I am sorrowful, My heart is lone and drear; Thine absence is a darkened spot On all the bright things here. All grief will wear a darker hue, No longer shared by thee, And every sorrow, every pain, Be heavier far to me. Yet, sister, go, as from the sky Departs the smiling sun, Which, though it leaves us cold and dark, Speeds brightly, gladly on. THE PITCHER-PLANT. The song-bird came, with weary wing, From breezy blossomed groves, Where fountains flow, and blossoms spring, And happy creatures rove. All heedlessly the wild thing strayed Along the desert plain, And sought the fruit, the breezy shade, And cooling stream in vain. His little throat grew swollen and dry, His voice was faint and low, And dim and heavy grew his eye In day's meridian glow. With drooping plumes he fluttered round; No kind relief was nigh; He dropped exhausted on the ground, And closed his wings to die; But near him, on the burning waste, In lonely beauty grew, A plant with pearly blossoms graced, Which lived upon the dew. With quivering form and panting breath, He crept beneath the shade; And there upon the naked earth His little head was laid. Above him drooped the slender boughs, With humble blossoms hung; Oh, how unlike the rich red rose His native bowers among! Ah, sadly beautiful they come Before his closing eyes, Shades of his dear deserted home, Where living fountains rise. But hark! a wandering zephyr shakes The plant 'neath which he lies, And on his ear a murmur breaks,â âRise, weary wanderer, rise!â Then trembling o'er his aching head, Low drooped the blossomed bough, And clear and cooling drops were shed Upon his burning brow. It was the Pitcher-Plant that grew Above his desert bed, And grateful was the shower of dew, Its generous blossoms shed. He rose, he drank, he dressed his wings, And smoothed his ruffled plumes; And soon, with grateful carollings, His onward flight resumes. But still around that lonely tree The breezy angel stayed, And thus, in balmy tones, to me The desert blessing said: âArt thou a wanderer from the bowers Of beauty, love, and truth, Where songs, and dews, and balmy flowers, Were clustered round thy youth? âAnd hast thou found life's onward way A desert, dry and drear? Where no sweet streams of blessing stray, No fruits or flowers appear? âAnd art thou weary, sad, and faint, And dost thou wish to die? Look up! there is a Pitcher-Plant, With consolation nigh. âLook up! it offers unto thee The dew of holy love; Accept the gift, 'tis pure and free, A treasure from above. âDrink, and rejoice beneath the shade, And plume thy drooping wing; Then journey where thy path is laid Toward the Living Spring. âAy, onward to the verdant shore, With songs, pursue thy way; That blessed home, whence never more The bird shall wish to stray.â FORGOTTEN. Forgotten! 'Tis a cold and fearful word, And sends a thrill of anguish through the heart, That there will come a day in which our face, Our voice, our deeds, our love, our very name, Will be forgotten. When the beaming eyes That greet us now will all be dark in death;â When souls that now respond to all our words, As the Ãolian answers to the wind, Shall have forgotten the familiar tone;â When those for whom we now act zealously, Shall need our aid no more, and think no more Of all that we did for them;âwhen no trace Or footprint shall remain to tell of us, Around the spot where now we toil and rest, The spot we fondly call our pleasant home;â When of the hearts that throb reply to ours, And deem our love the treasure of their lives, Not one shall be remaining;âwhen the name To which we answer, though it may be known, And call reply from thousands, shall awake In no one heart on earth a thought of us; That of the busy hundreds who will throng The city or the country where we dwelt, Not one will think of us; and that of those Who haply occupy the very house That we have builded, eat the ripened fruit From off the trees we planted, draw and drink Cool water from the well that we have dug, And bless the habitation, the broad tree, And living water, none will know or care To whom they are indebted. Thoughts like these Lie cold and heavy on the shuddering heart, What time the shadows of this lower world Shut from its hemisphere the light of heaven. To die, to be incorporateâthis fair form Dissolved and mingled with the elements Of which it is so wondrously composed, Till even the grave itself retains no trace Of that which weeping love deposited Within its sacred bosom. Nature shrinks From such a terrible nonentity, And thinks to bribe a nation's gratitudeâ To win the admiration of the worldâ To add a plume to honour's coronetâ To fix its features on the plastic heart Of fond enduring love, that some of these May write its name upon the corner-stone Of Memory's sacred temple, on the rock O'er which oblivion's dark and silent sea Has never heaved its billows. Vain device! What boots it that a name shall be preserved, When we ourself, our face, our voice, our love, Shall be remembered by no living thing! The heart hath built a refuge for itself, From thoughts so full of sadness. It hath reared A temple of the bright but withered buds Of human tenderness; in which young Hope Sits, ever singing to her golden lyre:â Love liveth ever, Time's shore beyond; Death cannot sever Love's beautiful bond. Love is a spirit, Immortally bright; Love must inherit Eternal delight. Truth is undying, Love is the truth; Fondly relying In bosom of youth; Rich rapture bringing All through life's day, Faithfully clinging In age or decay. Love is a treasure, Filling the soul; Love hath no measure, Owns no control; Nobly it shieldeth, Guardeth its own; Love never yieldeth Its idolized one. When death is nearest, Love's spirit-light, Strongest and clearest, Beams on the night; Love is immortal,â O'er his bright chain Death's heavy portal Closeth in vain. Still the tie bindeth, Strong and unriven, Till the soul findeth The lost one in heaven. Look ye to heaven, Heaven is Love's home; There never riven, His garlands shall bloom. Thus hope consoleth hearts that weep or bleed O'er broken ties, in desolated bowers, With beautiful delusion that the loves Of earth are holy, and survive in heaven, Where love hath but one altar, one pure fire, And God is âall in all.â Oh, blessed dream! It lies so soothingly upon the soul! And we go down so calmly to the grave, Trusting so earnestly that human love Will wear us in its bosom evermore. 'Tis sweet to rest us on a chosen breast, And listen to the pulsing heart within, While tender accents win us to believe That every throb is warm with love for us, And must be always so. Ah, fond, fond heart! Such trust is sweet; oh, wrap it in strong faith, And lock it in thine inmost sanctuary, Where doubt may never find itâwhere distrust Can never enter, or experience come To leave her naked footprintsâwhere the winds That walk the world and converse with mankind May find no ingress. In such holy place Thou mayst preserve it, and with earnest soul Pay adoration to its holiness; And it shall be a blessing to thy life, A joy, a beauty to thee all thy days; And thou mayst die, believing that thy love Will live in one devoted tender heart, Until its latest throb. But if thy soul Hold converse with experience, it must learn That this poor fading, changing, dying heart, Hath no meet chamber for eternal things. The holiest tablet of its altar-piece Is of such frail material, that the waves Of Time, which break upon it evermore, Wear out whatever is inscribed thereon, E'en though the hand of Love hath graved it deep, With Sorrow's iron pen. There was a time When I believed in never-dying love; But I have seen the end of love, as strong, As warm, as perfect, as has ever burned Within the heart of man. I had a friend,â An innocent and gentle-minded girl, With form, and face, and eye, and heart, and soul, As near perfection as 'tis possible For aught on earth to be. She was beloved, Ay, tenderly and well beloved by one, Of whom the wisest of the wise ones said, That he was worthy of her. They were wed,â Not merely linked by law, but as it seemed, Made one by the perfecting of a bond, Which some mysterious power of destiny, Had braided of all tender sympathies Around their hearts, which nestled each to each, And felt, and throbbed as one. Oft as I marked How like a flash of the electric fire, A thrill of feeling waking in one heart Passed through the other,âhow each beaming face Was but the other's mirror, faithfully Reflecting every change of light or shade That shadow joy or sorrow;âas I marked This perfect oneness, I believed and said, Change cannot come between them, or the pow'r Of death itself divide hearts so entwined, For surely one cannot be torn away, And leave one lifestring of the other whole. They had a child,âa treasure, a delight, A thing of life, and joy, and loveliness, A blending of their beings, heart and soul, A visible and everlasting tie, The tenderest and dearest link of love; And their affections, sympathies, and hopes Seemed gathered in a love-knot in their boy. But Mary died. I saw her in her shroud, With death's seal set upon her. The fixed eyes Gleamed darkly from beneath the heavy fringe Of the half-open and discoloured lids. The lips were livid, and the placid smile, Left by the happy spirit as it passed, Like radiance left by the departing sun Upon the western clouds, was fading out From the unseemly company of death. The widowed husband sat beside the bier, In broken-hearted sorrow, with the child Close nestled to his bosom. I observed How pale, how very wretched he appeared, And thought, how soon that hapless little one Will be without a father, all alone In this wide world, which mocks the desolate With clustered flowers and wreaths of kindred hearts, And clinging sympathies. Time sped alongâ The mourner lived, ay, lived for that sweet child, And kept the mem'ry of the dear departed fresh Within his heart and green around his home. Whatever she had loved or touched, remained A sacred treasure; and the sodded grave In which she slept beside the garden wall, Was bright with garlands all the summer through. A weeping willow, trained with pious care, Was sighing there for ever, and the spot Was guarded from all sacrilegious feet By high strong palingâand no evening passed, That did not see the widower, with his child, Kneeling beside that grave. But I went forth, A wanderer o'er the world, and came again When scarce ten years had glided by. Oh, treacherous Time! How dost thou change all things in this false world! I passed along the once familiar street, And paused to look a moment on the home Of Mary living, and of Mary dead. Oh, what a change was there! a stately front Concealed the cottage, where my friend had dwelt In such contented bliss. A columned porch Was built, where grew her favourite trees and flowers; Her garden was included in the lawn That stretched before the mansion, and her grave Was overgrown with briers and flowers run wild, That mingled with the swaying willow-boughs. The fence was broken, and the little gate Lay almost prostrate, and the yellow rust Upon the hinges, proved that many a year It had remained unopened. While I gazed, A happy group approached along the lawn, A gentleman and lady, with a band Of sportive children. Near that lonely grave, The lady paused, and in a mournful tone, Addressed a bright-haired boyââHere, Theodore, Is your own mother's grave.â And that boy smiled, As he repliedââI know it, dear mamma!â Then turning to her husband, she went on: âIt makes me sad, to look on Mary's grave;â It wakes a thought that I, like her, may die, And be, like her, forgotten.â âDear Lenore!â The husband said, in half reproachful tones, âDream not that you can ever be forgot; You make us all so happy with your love, That we can find no moment for regret Or mournful memories. But, if that lone grave Awakes sad feelings in your gentle breast, It shall be newly fenced and beautified, And you may rear a monument of flowers, Meet emblems of your own sweet sympathies, Above the silent sleeper.â Sick at heart, I turned away and wept. And yet 'tis well And wisely ordered that the wounds of wo Should cease to bleed, and that the blighted heart Should bud and bloom afresh. 'Tis wise and well; But oh, it dissipates the bright romance Of Love's fond dreaming, with the clear cold truth, That even the good, the loving, and beloved, Before ten summers shine upon their graves, May be forgotten. MARAH. It was a fountain clear and deep, And grateful to the view; Yet on its brink no fragrant shrubs Or balmy blossoms grew. A few rank weeds, with thorny stems, Were darkly tangled there, And threw their rank and baleful breath On summer's sultry air. The weary bird, with trembling wing, Alighted on the brink, Just dipped her beak, wailed mournfully, And died; she could not drink. The thirsty traveller's burning gaze Upon that fountain fell, And gratefully he bent his knees Beside the limpid well, And stooped to drinkâha, bitterness! How nauscous was the taste, He cursed the spring, and turned away, To perish on the waste. Yet was that fountain clear and cool, And tempting to the sight; And mirrored in its bosom lay Heaven's own effulgent light. And murmuring forth a restless song, Its waters gushed away, And held a fitful wandering course, Like some glad child at play. But all along its winding course The earth was bare and dry, And shining fish, from other streams, But touched those wavesâto die. A prophet of the mighty God Unto that fountain came, Threw into it a curse of salt, And blessed it in God's name. Oh, what a change! That bitter well Was filled with life and health, And sweet and pure its waters flowed, A living stream of wealth. Soon clustering verdure crowned the banks, And on the balmy air Rich roses blended their perfume With breath of lilies fair; And luscious fruits and clustered vines, Grew up amongst the flowers; And many a joyous bright-winged bird, Was nestling in the bowers. And there the pilgrim paused at noon, His burning brow to lave, Allayed his thirst, refreshed his soul, And blessed the healthful wave. The human heart is such a spring, So bitter at its source, And thus its stream diffuses death Along its poisonous course. And while the bitter waters gush In streams of sin and wo, We know the fountain is not healed From which such waters flow. But touched by Grace, how pure and sweet The living waters spring, And make along life's barren way The sweetest verdure spring. All pure and gentle charities, That bless the fireside home, Awake in beauty, life, and joy, Where'er its waters come. FRIEND OF THE FRIENDLESS. Friend of the friendless! Oh! to thee, With bleeding heart I turn; Thy sunny world is dark to me, And evermore I mourn; The friends I lovedâoh! where are they? Dead, faithless, cold, or far away;â But Thou art kind, and ever near, To soothe the sigh and dry the tear. Hope of the hopeless! see the last Of my fond hopes is gone; A thousand brilliant dreams were past And this remained alone! Deep in my secret soul it lay, My dream by night, my bliss by day; 'Tis broken;âoh! 'twas vanity! Eternal Hope! I fly to thee. Joy of the joyless! see how low My full-blown joys are laid; Where are the precious idols now That my fond heart had made? See how it bleeds, yet madly clings Around the dear but ruined things; Help me to cast them from thy throne, And kneel and worship Thee alone. THE VIOLET. My garden boasts of many a flower, And garlands crown the field and grove; But here, beneath the hawthorn bower, I've found the flower I dearly love. Ah! meekly droops its fragrant head Upon the green earth's genial breast; And yet it seems that heaven has shed Its purest azure on its crest. And deep within its dewy eye A radiant sunbeam always lies, And from its bosom to the sky Its balmy breathings ever rise. And sometimes, when, at dreamy even, I've sought my favourite flower in vain, I fancied that the radiant heaven Had claimed its starry blue again. I oft have deemed this gentle flower In Flora's crown the sweetest gem, Like Piety with fragrant power, Adorning beauty's diadem. The richest beauty yields to death, And Genius' light will fade away, Fame may be blighted by a breath, And love and friendship own decay;â But Piety, divinely pure, However humble be its lot, Will shed, as long as life endure, A joy, a fragrance round the spot; And calmly pass away to live Where purity and beauty reign,â As dying violets seem to give Their azure back to heaven again. COME UNTO ME! âCome unto me, all ye who labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.â Matthew xi. 28. âCome to me!â the Saviour cried, Thou with toil and care oppressed; Come, ye heavy laden ones, And I will give you rest. Weary mortal, worn with pain, Bending 'neath the load of wo, Sweet and lasting is the rest That Jesus will bestow. Child of meagre poverty, Toiling for thy daily bread, Many a bitter heart-wrung tear It has been thine to shed; Cold and weary is thy lot, By want, and care, and scorn oppressed, Bring thy burden to the Lord, And He will give thee rest. Mourner! with the broken heart, Sobbing o'er the sable bier, Lies thy loved and loving one In death's cold ruin here? Kneel and pray; there is a balm Of power to soothe and heal thy breast; Jesus diedâand rose again, And He will give thee rest. Weary exile! all alone, Wandering in life's toilsome way, Has this world of love and joy No home, no hope for thee? Jesus, once a wanderer, Hath marked a path to mansions blessed; Follow meekly with thy cross And He will give thee rest. Rich man! art thou weary too Of fashion, pomp, and wakeful care? Hast thou learned that pride is pain, And gold a shining snare? Make the wealth that burdens thee Blessing to the poor, distressed; Jesus then will smile, and give His faithful steward rest. Humble sinner! kneeling low, Who dar'st not lift thine eyes to heaven, Though thy wickedness be great, It may be all forgiven; Do not suffer dark Despair To wind her chain about thy breast, Jesus is the sinner's friend, And He will give thee rest. Christian! with the death-damp brow, Fitful pulse, and sobbing breath, Struggling with the piercing pangs, And bitterer fears of death; Now, in thine extremest need, Oh, sweet the invitation blessed, Come, oh weary one, to me, In Everlasting Rest! THE SISTERS. Ann moved the reigning beauty Of the gorgeous lighted hall, Where incense, mirth, and melody Combined their magic thrall; Where smiles and silvery voices, And soft and flashing eyes, And wreaths, and plumes, and flashing gems, Formed pleasure's paradise. Where glittering forms were braiding The graceful, dreamy dance; And light feet flashed as mirrored stars On rippling waters glance. Amid this world of beauty, Queen-like she seemed to move, The spirit of its melody, The soul of health and love. That night, within her chamber, I heard that maiden say, âTake these detested ornaments, This torturing dress away; Wash from my cheek the carmine, The pearl-white from my neck; How sallow is my bosom now, How very pale my cheek! âNow bring my box of medicines, The drops of opiate tell; Oh, would this cup contained a draught From Lethe's fabled well, That so I might forget the pangs That pierced my heart to-night, As eyes that I would fain have filled, Turned elsewhere for their light. âFor heaven's sake, do not tease me With tales of want and wo; I paid my milliner so much, I've nothing to bestow; There may be young hearts breaking, There may be widows poor, But oh! they cannot feel the pangs, The sickness, I endure.â Grace walked that pleasant evening Amid the dewy flowers, While birds with vesper melody Were gathering to their bowers; The evening star was beaming Upon the quiet scene, With softened lustre,like a gem Through trembling waters seen. The peace of dewy twilight Lay soft o'er Nature's breast, And all the sweet and innocent Were sinking to their rest; The fragrant winds were breathing A soft and balmy hush, And peace had spread her brooding wings Where all pure fountains gush. And she, that white-robed maiden, With bright brown, braided hair, The meekest and the sweetest flower, Where all were meek and fair, Is stealing to the dwelling Where want and sickness lieâ A blessing to the weary heart, A joy-beam to the eye. She beareth consolation, She gives the hungry bread, And blessings from the comforted Are on her spirit shed. She seems an angel presence, A form of hope and love, To all the wretched ministering Sweet comforts from above. Fair sisters and young brothers Flock round her for a kiss; She knows the key to each young heart, And tunes them all to bliss. Crowned with her parents' blessing, She lays her down to sleep, And health and peace beside her bed Their pleasant vigils keep. THE ROSE AND MAIDEN. With dew-drops on her diadem, The rose sat queenlike in her bower, And round her, on their pensile stems, Hung many a sweet young flower; And 'mongst those blooms a maiden stood In radiant beauty's morning pride, With dewy glances worshipping The lover at her side. And there was music on the wind, And beauty in the earth, and sky, And with the living tide of bliss, All life seemed throbbing high. The rose's spray was dry and bare, And broken stalks around her lay; The rose, and her companions fair, Has passed in tears away; And in that life-deserted bower I saw a pale and drooping girl, Whose dim eye shed upon the earth Full many a liquid pearl. And there was wailing on the wind, And in her breast a grief untold; Where vanished love had left behind His shadow black and cold. The virgin snow-wreath, chill and white, Lay glistening on the frozen spray, And like pure marble monuments, O'er all the blossoms lay; And then beside the open grave, Wrapped in the shroud that maiden lay; The lashes of her leaden eyes Shadowing the cheek of clay; And there were anthems on the wind, And agony in many a breast, As, earth to earth, they there consigned, The broken heart to rest. ONE DAY IN THY COURTS IS BETTER THAN A THOUSAND. One day in thy courts, oh, thou glorious King! Where thine honour is dwelling, in mercy arrayed, Where the wounded in spirit their sacrifice bring, And the poor broken heart on thine altar is laid; One day in thy courts, where the humble are kneeling, With tears of deep penitence silently stealing, The wound of the penitent spirit revealing, And the voice of the pleaders ascends to thy throne, In the name of thy Son, our Redeemer alone. One day in thy courts, where thy minister stands, In vestments that shadow the pure mind within, While sweet on the penitent spirit descends Thy message of gracious deliverance from sin; One day in thy courts, where the ransomed are bending, Hearts, spirits, and voices, in harmony blending, In faith that the Teacher divine is attending; Oh, surely the prayer by Immanuel given, When uttered by Faith, must find favour in heaven. One day in thy courts, where the anthem of praise To Maker, Redeemer, and Comforter rise, While organ's deep tones swell the triumphant lays That seem but to echo the hymns of the skies; One day in thy courts, where thy servant is reading The pure word of life, and thy chosen flock feeding; With sinners, thy mercy and faithfulness pleading, Still pointing to Jesus on Calvary bleeding, From whose wounded side flows the water and blood Which cleanse from all guilt and redeem us to God. One day in thy courts, when thy table is spread, And the pure in heart bidden to feast with the Lord, Where Immanuel's body is broken in bread, Where his covenant blood in the wine-cup is poured; One day in thy courts, where the rich bread of heaven, To comfort and cheer the poor pilgrim is given, Where the well of salvation, with streams ever living Invites us to drink, with a hymn of thanksgiving, Remem'bring with transports of sorrow and love, The crucified Lord who now reigneth above. One day in thy courts, where the fir and the pine, With Lebanon's glory, the cedar's dark green, While glittering leaves of the box-tree combine Their beautiful garlands the branches between, Fulfilling the anthem thy prophet was singing, Who saw far away the clear Gospel-day springing, With âGlory to God,â from angelic hosts ringing; And men crown'd with peace,with glad hosannah's bringing The evergreen branches, from valley and hill, The place of thy feet with their glory to fill. One day in thy courts!âoh, how good to the soul Which has longed weary years in those courts to appear; In a dry barren land, where no bright waters roll, No cooling spring gushes, the weary to cheer; Which has wept day and night, while the taunters were saying, âWhere now is thy God, thou forsaken and straying?â One day in thy courts, where the blessed are staying, With holiday gladness rejoicing and praying, Is better, oh better, than thousands could be, Where all this world's treasures were garnered and free. THE WINTER WIND. Thou hast a mournful voice, oh, Winter Wind! A mournful voice and dirgelike melody; And deeper sadness penetrates the mind, As with thy wailing song thou lingerest by. There is a pleading sadness in thy tone, As with thy wing thou beatest at the door, Or shak'st the shutters, chaunting in the tone Of wild and fitful minstrelsy of yore. I listen to thy harpings, and at times Distinctly catch the burden of thy lay; Some tale of human suffering, wreathed in rhyme, That wakens the deep heart of sympathy. Oh, mournful are thy stories, Winter Wind, And few there be that love thy truthful lay; Wild fiction better suits the general mind,â The viol pleases best the rich and gay. The happy do not heed thee; but the poor, The weeping widow, and the orphan child, The lone wife listening at the cottage door, The silent mourner, and the weeper wild;â These hear thy sobbing voice, and sadly blend Their sighs and wailing with thy plaintive lay; Oh, sadder words than romance ever penned, Compose the chorus of thy minstrelsy. Moans of the perishing, who, all life long, Have struggled with misfortune's cruel sway; Who might have won the richest meed of earth, Had one Samaritan came by that way. Of some who lie beneath the crushing weight Of scorn, and poverty, perchance of crime; Who, raised and cheered by generous sympathy, Had won the proudest height the soul can climb. Oh, bitter voices mingle in thy hymn; For bitter is the voice of that despair Which will not sue to man, and has not faith To offer to the Merciful one prayer. And painful are thy sobbing cadences, The mournful sighing of the desolate, In whose cold hearts the last dear bud of hope Lies withered by the wintry blast of fate. Oh, Winter Wind, thou hast a mournful voice Of mingled shrieks and wailings, sighs and moans; The poor and wretched understand thy song, And feel, ah, keenly feel, thy piercing tones. THE CHURCH. Rage on, vain world; and thou, Fanaticism, Brandish thy noisy weapons, and shout forth Thy maddest war-cry, while low Ignorance Projects his weapons, clay and clods of earth. Ye rage in vain, ay, though the infernal gate Swing wide, and vomit fiendish malice out, The Church is safe, she fears no mortal arm, No demon ire, no threat, no battle shout; The Church is safe; on the eternal Rock, On which Immanuel laid her corner-stone, She sits secure, nor fears the battle shock, Though all the adverse powers unite as one. Ye cannot mar her beauty, or efface Her builder's signet from her guarded door, Or break one stone of her pure polished wall, With gracious promises engraven o'er. The storm may beat, the sea may roll his surge, The world may rage, and hell its powers combine, The Church is safe upon her living Rock, And heaven's celestial glories round her shine, And grace and honour bind the rev'rend brows Of those, who at her sacred altars wait, And they are safe, and blest for evermore, Who find their rest within her guarded gate. For He, the First, the Last, th' Almighty God, Is ever near, to succour and defend; This is his promise, written on her towers: âLo, I am with you always, to the end!â FAME. Imperial Goddess of the air, Enthroned in intellectual light, Thy signet kings are proud to wear, And Virtue deems it bright. But Genius worships at thy feet, With burning heart upraised to thee, While on its coals, like incense sweet, His life consumes away. He feels the dying embers glow Without one pang of fond regret,â Content if on his death-white brow Thy signet may be set. More precious than the purest gem From ocean cave, or mountain mine, More glorious than the diadem, Is that bright seal of thine. No power of darkness can conceal, No flood can quench its living ray: Its lustre is the earthly seal Of immortality. Once uttered by thy voice divine, A name must live for evermoreâ An anthem of the sea of Time, Along the sounding shore. But why should Woman kneel to thee, And ask the gift that men adore? Why should she wish to have her name Remembered evermore? The meekness of a holy love Should shed its radiance on her brow, With Piety, a gem above Thy meteoric glow. One loving heart alone should bear The living impress of her name, And children, trained with tender care, Should be her all of Fame. The heart is sick; it hath no rest, Where Woman's sacred rest should be, If in its yearnings to be blest It wildly follows thee. But oh! to Woman's soul thou art A mirage on life's desert sand, Luring the weary, burning heart As to a heavenly land. But when she thinks to wear thy flowers, To rest beside thy fountain fair, And banquet in thy vocal bowersâ The hot dry sand is there. LIFE. Like a strain of melody, Gushing from an angel lyre, With a wild and tuneful wail, Breaking from the quivering wire; Ruffling with its viewless wing, One small billow of the air; Then with cadence of a sigh, Passingâno one knoweth where. Such is Lifeâand even so Passeth it from earth away; Where it findeth place of rest, Echo cometh not to say. Yet Faith heareth far away, Where no venturous foot hath trod, Floods of perfect melody, Living round the throne of God. TO HIM WHO SAID, âGOD BLESS YOU!â âGod bless you!â Oh, I thank thee for thy prayer, It falls so like a balm-leaf on my heart, My weary heart, which beats so heavily, And needs the blessing which those words impart, God bless you! When I am lone, and drooping, and oppressed With griefs which woman trusts not to the air, My trembling spirit shall ascend to heaven, And hear thy voice of music pleading there, God bless you! And when my heart is glad with joy or hope, Or Friendship's blissful presence, sweetly then Will Memory point my trembling thought to thee, And hear repeated, with a glad Amen, God bless you! No incense breath of flattery or applause, Nor voice of Fame, which man will die to hear; Or Love, earth's echo to the pulse of heaven, Could touch my spirit like that earnest prayer, God bless you! God bless you!âMay the prayer thy heart sent up, To plead with God for one of earth unblest, Return with blessings bright and warm from heaven, And lay them all upon thy brow and breast. God bless you! THE RUINED HEART. There is a noble temple, which of yore Was glorious, with a sumptuous garniture Of shining tapestry, embroidered o'er With ever-changing magic portraiture. All lovely and exalted things of earth, Each touched with glory beaming from on high, Shifting in beauty, as the gorgeous folds Were moved by breezes voiced with melody. And there was wreathing up for evermore Rich incense from pure censers of fine gold, Where all sweet thoughts assembled to adore, And touch the sacred fire with bliss untold. Then in that temple all was light and joy, And melody and beauty mingled there; Now, come and look how dark, how desolate, How cold, how voiceless, all its chambers are! Long since the bitter waters of despair Quenched out the fire upon that altar-stone, And mourning spread her pall of midnight there, And music died in one low quivering moan. Yet oft at nightfall to the bolted door Sweet shadowy groups of spirit memories come, The dear familiar faces shaded o'er With tender sadness by the twilight gloom. They linger sadly round the ruined place, And plead for entrance with a low sweet tone; But angels cross that threshold never more, And Echo answersââI am here alone!â TO MRS. S?. A COMMENT ON HER WORDS, âMY FIRST-BORN SON,â IN A LETTER TO THE AUTHOR. (1838.) âMy first-born son!â If aught there is That touches all affection's chords, And stirs the deepest fount of bliss, It lives in these endearing words. How many thrilling cares and fears Are born with that one helpless child, Is witnessed by the throbs and tears With which his new-named parents smiled. From the deep spirit gushes forth A spring of love unknown before, And there's no power, no spell of earth, Can keep that spring from running o'er. Dear madam, may no bitter drop Dash that sweet fountain in thy breast; No cruel canker blight thy hope, No mildew on thy young bud rest. But may he flourish, strong and fair, A beautiful and blessed child, That thou mayst feel no bitter care For that fair form and spirit mild; But even in his infant breast, May Jesus plant his love divine, And grace upon his spirit rest, To shed the dew of peace on thine. So shall he be the glorious flower, That crowns with joy the parent tree, And bless thee in thine autumn hour, With ripe fruits of felicity. And when at length the snows of age Lie cold and heavy on thy head, His piety shall pain assuage, And smiling comfort round thee spread. Thus would I bless thee in thy son,â But, lady! He, who knoweth best, May choose to take thy little one To his celestial home of rest. Remember, when thy warm heart clings Fondly around thy infant boy, That death may break those twining strings, And rob thee of a parent's joy. Then do not fondly idolize The treasure lent thee from above, But hold it as a sacred trust From Him who claims supremest love. Then should his tender mercy free From earth and sin that darling child, Thou wilt escape the agony That tortures th' unreconciled. CENTENARY HYMN. COMPOSED FOR THE CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION OF THE GERMAN REFORMED CHURCH. (1841.) Thou who art enthroned in Glory, Crowned with Love and robed in Grace, Lo! we humbly bow before Thee, Off'ring up our songs of praise. Mighty God and gracious Saviour! Spirit of enduring grace! Come, in thine especial favour, With thy Glory fill this place. See the star whose rising splendour Heralded a Saviour's birth, Now in its meridian grandeur, Smiles upon the joyous earth; Heart, and hand, and effort blending, In its radiance now we meet; And our mingled pray'rs ascending Seek thee on thy mercy-seat. We would celebrate the changes Which a Hundred Years have made, Since our fathersâpoor and strangersâ Sought the Western forest's shade. From Helvetia's vine-clad mountains Came a little friendless band; By the rich Rhine's infant fountains, Others left their father-land. Germany's bright streams are flowing Through the vales where others dwelt; Or her mountain winds are blowing Past the altars where they knelt. Thou wert with them o'er the ocean, To these wilds where freedom stray'd, 'Neath her bowers, with true devotion, First these grateful pilgrims pray'd. Here the little vine, increasing, Spread its branches green and fair; Now, by thine especial blessing, See how wide thy vineyards are! Come and take the ripen'd clusterâ All the vintage, Lord, is thine;â But let mercy temper justice, Where thou meet'st a fruitless vine. Humble are the gifts we offer, Bless them in thy grace divine; Thou wilt not despise the proffer, Though the universe is thine. Make our gifts a rich oblation Many a mourning heart to cheer, While the light of thy salvation Gilds each penitential tear. Let our institutions flourish, Sending forth a pious band, With the words of life to nourish All who hunger through the land. Zion spreads her hands before Thee; Come, and in her temples reign,â While we give all praise and glory To the triune God.âAmen! SUMMER, FAREWELL! Sweet Summer! fare thee well! I hear thy passing sigh Sweep fitfully along the dell, Where the last fainting blossoms lie. The tulip's reign is o'er, The rose has passed away, The snowy lily blooms no more, The honeysuckle owns decay. Sweet Summer, fare thee well! Thy long bright days are past; The rays that on earth's bosom fell Now all aslant the zone are cast. The seraphs of the earth Have ceased the hymning lay, And from the bowers of their birth Are flitting silently away. Sweet Summer, fare thee well! Thy bowers are growing drear, While thick upon the fitful gale Flutters the foliage rest and sere. While, writhing in the blast, The strong and stately trees Bow meekly to the storm, and cast Their glorious chaplets on the breeze. Sweet Summer, fare thee well! By forest, stream, or grove, Thy joyous notes no longer swell To ecstacy and holy love. Alas, the joyous time Of flow'rs, and glittering wings! Alas, the Summer's balmy prime, And all her rich and glorious things! Sweet Summer! fare thee well! Winter will build thine urn, And wildly shriek thy funeral knell,â Yet thou wilt joyfully return. I will not weep for thee, Or my own summer fled;â Thou wilt return triumphantly, And I arise rejoicing from the dead THE MAIDEN TO HER MOTHER. Oh, let me die, dear mother, With my head upon thy breast, Thus sinking in thy loving arms To sweet unbroken rest. Look on me with thy loving eyes, Thou need'st not hide the tears, But let me see the loving smile That blessed my sunny years. Oh, bless thee for the sorrow That heaves thy gentle heart, I would not have thee cold and calm The while my lifestrings part; Noâlet me feel the tear and smile That speak thy yearning love,â A love almost as pure as that To which I now remove. But do not mourn, dear mother, When all my pains are o'er, And grief, and wrong, and bitterness, Can come to me no more. Oh, never wish me back to earth, Where all sweet blossoms fade, And where the brightest form of joy Is followed by a shade. I would not stay, dear mother, Till blight and sorrow come, Till disappointment, care, and pain, Have made my breast their home; Then let me die now, mother dear, Encircled by thy love, And pass from thy sweet home below, To God's pure home above. THE WOMAN TO HER GRAND-DAUGHTER. Oh, bless thee, dearest daughter, Of my youngest, dearest child, Thou hast thy gentle mother's voice, So musically mild; I deem that thou art like her, too, In beauty's maiden grace, Though these dim eyes could never read The features of thy face. But in my soul she liveth, My beautiful young dove, And thou art like her, for thou hast Her voice and heart of love. Once more arrange the pillows for This weak and weary head,â Thank God, who gave me such a child, To smooth my dying bed! Nay, do not weep, my darling, 'Tis time that I should die, The chill of death is in my veins, Its darkness on mine eye; And unto me so many years Have been in mercy given, That I am ready for the grave, And wait and long for heaven. My life has not been weary In useful labour spent, With cheerful service in my hands, And in my heart content; And loveâthe truest human loveâ Has walked beside me still, A light, a joy, a comforter, Through scenes of good and ill. Though of the dear and loving, To me in kindness given, Some in their youth and loveliness Have passed away to heaven; I never have been left alone, For still around me grew A cluster of devoted hearts, The tender, tried, and true. Though now the dim land's shadow Hath closed before mine eyes, Deep treasured in my spirit's shrine, A blazoned volume lies; And Memory turneth leaf by leaf, Before my mental sight, And all the pictures of the past Are lifelike in her light. I never have been lonely, In my darkness and my pain, With past and present tenderness, To solace and sustain; And now the future lies revealed, In light and joy divine, By the sure mercies of my God, Through Christ's redemption, mine. ON HEARING A BLUEBIRD SING. Thou Giver of all perfect gifts, I thank Thee for the singing bird, Since by her voice devotion's strings Within my heart are stirred. Oh, what a loving joyous hymn She singeth from the leafless tree, She hath no sorrow, feels no care, But gladly trusts in Thee. Her carol melts the heavy ice Of unbelief that chained my soul, As sunbeams break the icy bands Of Winter's long control. I thank Thee for the singing bird, Thine angel to this cold world given, With azure wing and song of love, To lift the heart to heaven. Oh, were I like that trusting bird, That sings beneath the sunny sky, And meekly folds her wings, and waits Till night and storm pass by; That joys to build her little nest, And dwell in woodlands wild and free, And warble out her little soul In melody to Thee. Thou Giver of all perfect gifts, I thank Thee for the singing bird, Since by her voice the holy springs Of love and faith are stirred. TO HIM WHO PRESENTED TO ME A PEN. Dear friend, till now I had not dipp'd in ink The diamond point of this, thy gift to me, And now my hand and heart would dedicate The earliest tracery of thy gift to thee. Oh, that my soul were worthy of thy gift, Then would I register immortal lays, And set thy name in pure and dazzling gems, Amid a trophy of Parnassian bays. But 'tis not mineâmy friend, it is not mine, To charm in living numbers, from the lyre, Such words as burn themselves into the soul, And live for ever, like heaven's altar-fire; Nor may I hope to write the hymn that flows With murmur of sweet music, evermore, Like clear cold waters with their silvery tone, And holy blessing to the flowery shore. It needs no lay of mine to keep thy worth Green in the temple of immortal fame, For thou hast placed it where it shall endure When earth has lost the echo of my name. But with thy precious gift, my generous friend, I grave thy memory in the spirit-shrine, Where Gratitude shall wreath it with her hymn Of living incense, to the Friend divine. THE ANGEL'S VISIT. My head was weary, and my heart was faint With toil, and care, and sorrow, and I lay In dreamy musing, while the holy moon Poured o'er my pillow her celestial day. A gentle murmur, as of waving wings, Which shed a soothing balm upon the air, Now filled my chamber. 'Tis the angel Sleep, I said; she comes in answer to my prayer; And I will see her beauty, and will gaze Into the poppies on her brow and breast, And watch the dreamy spirits braid the spells That shed enchantment o'er the hour of rest. I looked;âthere stood an angel by my bed, But 'twas not Sleep with heavy-lidded eyes, With slumbrous wreaths, and sceptre of such down As o'er the bosom of the cygnet lies. But looking down upon me, with such eyes As make the spirit conscious of their power To search the springs that move its deepest chord, And read the heart-leaf of its inmost flower; With neither badge or emblem, there she stood, The holy moonlight resting on her brow, And draping her fair form;âwith trembling voice, I murmured, âHeavenly creature! who art thou?â Then came a voice, still as an infant's sleep, Yet thrilling as the trumpet's tone of fear; My soul grew faint, and trembled as she spake,â âI am the Spirit of the passing year. âLo! I have walked beside thee many days, With ministry of mercy; now I go To Him who sent me, for the New Year comes, I hear his footsteps in the drifting snow. âSearch now amid my precious gifts to thee, Some gem that hath received no earthly stain, Which I may bear with me to Heaven, a pledge That I have not been sent to thee in vain. âAnd it shall be an evidence for thee, When thou shalt stand before the judgment seat, Where years misspent, and gifts unsanctified, In dark array thy naked soul shall meet.â âWhat shall I give?â I asked. And she replied, âBring me the days that have been well employed, The blessings worthily and purely used, The hallowed griefs, bliss blamelessly enjoyed.â I searched the days, but not a single gem Of all the chain was perfect in its light, My heart was fainting as I marked the stains, On things that came from heaven, so pure and bright. And then I scanned the deeds that I had done, For one so pure that it might speak to God; I might as well have sought the morning star Amongst the fragile blossoms of the sod. I turned me to the precious things of life, And sought one leaf that was not touched of earth, But Truth, and Hope, and Faith, and Charity, Ah me! and yet they were of heavenly birth. But Love and FriendshipâI have kept them pure In my heart's holiest chamber. Look! I cried, How perfect, how divinely beautiful, How long enduring and how sorely tried! Yes, they shall be my pleaders. So I laid My priceless jewels in the moon's cold ray, And looked upon them,âoh! the dear frail things! I hid them in my heart, and turned away. âGo, bring thy lyre,â the pitying angel said, âIt hath perchance some high and holy hymn, Which may be offered at the Throne of Heaven, And mingled with the living seraphim.â I brought the harp, and as I touched the strings, Each threw its holiest gem upon my breast, But as I looked upon them, I beheld My heartâmy heart on every one impressed. âGive me a prayer,â she said, âone earnest prayer That hath upon its wing no human stain.â âYes! I can find a sinless prayer,â I said; And sought it with a prayer, but sought in vain. âI have no pure memento then,â I sighed, âWhich may in Heaven's bright treasury be kept;â Thou hast been mine in vain, departing year! Oh, lost for ever!ââBitterly I wept. And then the angel smiled. âThou'st found the gift,â She whispered. âThese are penitential tears; I bear the humble pleaders up to God, With better promise for the future years.â THE REVELATION. The world was gathered at Beth-araba, Beyond the Jordan, in the wilderness, Attracted thither by the Messenger Whom God had sent before Immanuel's face, Was preaching fearlesslyâexclaiming still, âRepent ye, for the kingdom of our God Is now at hand; repent, and bring such fruits As may avert the near impending rod. âRenounce all wicked ways, and be baptized For the remission of your many sins; Flee from the wrath to come, before the day That burns with fire unquenchable begins. âI baptize you with water, but there comes One after me, far mightier than I; He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, And fire from the pervading flame on high.â His words fell on the multitudes with power, Convincing them of sin, abasing pride, And moving hundreds to confess their guilt And seek remission at the cleansing tide. Then Jesus came, with unpretending mien, From Galilee to Jordan, unto John, To be baptized of him, and thus fulfil All righteousness, and put his mission on. The rite was finished, and as Jesus came Up from the water, lo! a voice, so clear, Distinct, and soul-pervading, came from heaven, And fell distinctly on the startled ear, Proclaiming:ââThis is my beloved Son, In whom I am well pleased!ââthe while a dove Descended swiftly from the open heaven, And closed above his brow its wings of love. Thus stood Immanuel, with the Holy Ghost Brooding upon him, while from heaven pealed The undoubted voice of the Eternal God, And thus, the Triune Godhead was revealed. TO MRS. SIGOURNEY, (1844.) To me thou seem'st a beauteous shell, Thrown out upon some fairy isle, In whose deep heart a spirit band Are hymning all the while. Rich music, wreathed of sun and shade, Of love and grief, of joy and wo, A thrilling of all tender chords That human bosoms know; And woven through each mellow lay The same rich tone for ever rings, The music of the ocean lyre Swept by ethereal wings. Yes, though upon the mountain top The shell of ocean seems to sleep, Still murmurs from its inmost cell The music of the deep. And I have deemed thee like a bird Brought from some far-off sunny land, Where sport in never-fading groves The tuneful-hearted band; Where melody the whole day long Lies languid on the scented air, And purple evening bears to heaven Rich wreaths of chaunted pray'r. Though captive in this wintry clime, And taught full many a foreign song, Which thy rich mellow cadences Delightfully prolong; The native notes, so wild and sweet, That dwell in thy deserted home, Gush forth unbidden from thy heart, Where'er thy pinions roam. For all the breathings of thy lyre, Whate'er the lay, whate'er the theme, Be it the moan of chill despair, Or young life's passion dream; Or if maternity's deep love Gush tremblingly o'er the thrilling string, Or maidenhood's pure trust and truth, And fervent worshipping; Or the low wail above the bier Where the heart's jewels broken lie; Or the sweet hymn of holy Hope That bears the soul on high;â All breathe of heaven; a gentle strain Of pure and earnest piety; The music of thy spirit-home Pervades thy minstrelsy. THE BATTLE-FIELD. It is the field of battle, overspread With hideous mangled remnants of the dead; Tread warily, for look! the beaten sod Is foul with dark coagulated blood; Foxes, and dogs, and loathsome birds of prey, Feasting with joy on poor mortality; Sucking the blood, tearing the hero's breast, Eating the patriot's heart. Ha! horrid feastâ Yet not an arm is tossed to fright away The sated rovers from the gory prey; And not a sound awakes the tainted air, Though even the tongue the glutted vultures tear. And can these be the remnants of the bands By honour's voice impelled from distant lands, Who yestermorning gloried in their might, And stamped the earth, impatient for the fight? Who vowed to win a laurel and a name, Meet for the altar of immortal fame? Yet there's no wreath upon the ghastly brow, And who will name these festering relics now? While all that Fame with brazen tongue can tell Is, that they marched to battle, fought, and fell; And Honour, if a garland she bestow, Will bind it proudly round the general's brow; While over these, an undistinguished heap, Even their country will not pause to weep. Is this the fame, the honour, and the meed, For which the iron-hearted soldiers bleed? Can this be man's unenviable lot, To perish like a dog and be forgot? Forgot? Oh, no! For though his country shed No tears, no honours, on his lowly bed, Still each has left in some dear distant home, The tree of memory in its richest bloom, Whose strong and tender tendrils are entwined Round every fibre of some gentle mind; Some woman's heart, that cherishes its bloom, And feeds her spirit with its rich perfume. Look here! This severed hand belongs to one Who was a widowed mother's only son; She now sits lonely in her cottage home, And looks, and longs, to see her darling come. By her, affliction, poverty, and scorn, Have been with fortitude and meekness borne; Her children faded in their infant bloom, And one by one sunk smitten to the tomb; Yet then a soothing light from Paradise, Shone through the tears that filled her clouded eyes. And when adversity, with iron hand, Shook her, an exile from her native land, She clung the closer with a woman's truth To him on whom she hung the trust of youth. But when with broken spirit he bent down, 'Neath fortune's blow and the world's scornful frown; When all her tender soothing proved in vain, And even her smile but added to his pain; When on his cheek consumption's hectic bloom Began to wreath the garland of the tomb; Then with a fond and faithful Christian's care She fled to God with agonizing prayer, Lest doubt should hang her pall above his tomb, And shroud her mourning spirit in its gloom. But when the peace and happiness of heaven, To his subdued and humble soul were given, When love divine, with its triumphant ray, Scattered the clouds of guilt and doubt away, With joy she heard the parting spirit sing, âGrave! where's thy victory? Death! where is thy sting?â And in the bliss of his eternal gain, Almost forgot her widowhood and pain. Yet now her dwelling was an humble shed, And her own hand procured her daily bread; No wonder that her heart, so wrung and reft, Clung fondly to her only treasure left; The little boy, who, when his father died, Kissed her pale cheek to soothe her while she criedâ No wonder that she watched him day and night, And could not trust her treasure from her sight; No wonder that her eye had learned to seek Its hope's assurance on his ruddy cheek; That her ear tingled, and her heart grew faint, If from his lips escaped the least complaint; That she abridged her wardrobe and her bread, That he might be with classic treasures fed; And that as age made brain and eye grow dim, She leaned for light and comfort all on him. How came he here? Alas! the youthful mind To chivalry and daring deeds inclined; With ardent heart he joined the patriot band That loved the honour of their native land; And though he thought upon his mother's tears, And knew how age increases love's fond fears, His young heart knew notâoh, it could not knowâ The depth of that fond widowed mother's wo; But thought with fame and honour to return, And bid her heart with pride and rapture burn. He left her on her knees, and, night and day, Her whole employment was to weep and pray. But He who would possess her heart alone Has stricken her dear idol from its throne. Now when the tidings pierce through her dull ears, And her dim eyes pour forth their bitterest tears, With broken heart descending to the tomb, While no loved face illumes that path of gloom, Her wounded heart will meekly turn to God, And learn to bless his name, and kiss his rod. Here lies a ghastly head, with here and there, Amongst the thick dark curls, a silver hair, Even through the shades of death, the eye can trace Manhood's full ripen'd beauty in the face; But the wide eyes are passionless and dim, As if no feeling e'er had swayed with him. Yet he has felt, as few are form'd to feel; And lovedâbut few have ever loved so well; And she, who was the centre of his bliss, Was worthy of a love and truth like his. And there were joys within his humble home, Such as have seldom blest the lordly dome; For love, with full confiding, nestled there, And health and industry excluded care; And they were happy in a conscious pride, That all the other's bliss on each relied; And oh, how dear was every blooming child, That on that happy mother's bosom smiled. Those who live only for domestic joys, Unvex'd by pride, or fashion's empty toys; Who pass long years in one sweet blessed home, Where anguish and bereavement never come, Where wild ambition never lights his fires, Where avarice never comes with mean desires, Where this one wish pervades each pious breast, To see its loved ones all supremely blest;â He only unto whom it has been given To live the lord of such a perfect heaven, Has felt the poignant pang of agony, With which this slaughtered one came forth to die, While on his bosom big bright tear-drops shone, Wrung from a heart that worshipp'd him alone; And a cold, trembling hand's long lingering press, Was thrilling every nerve of tenderness. âOh God! to thy protection I confide My widow and my fatherless,â he cried; âFarewell! I shall return to you no moreâ And now the bitterness of death is o'er.â Bravely he stood upon this battle-field, His country's honour and her rights to shield; He fell, and with him died the heavenly bloom Of happiness within his darken'd home. If the bright orb of light and warmth were riven From his high centre, in the glowing heaven, The planets that now dance around his throne, Receiving light and life from him alone, In cold chaotic death and darkness left, Would shadow forth the home whence he was reft. Pause here a momentâhere lies one who died In the full bloom of manhood's morning pride, How calm, how still, how placid, seems his sleep; Come, look upon this marble brow, and weep. Here lies the blood all clotted on his breast, And here's the ball-hole in the broider'd vest. His hand is thrust within,âlet's view the wound;â Oh look! see what a treasure I have found! See what a brilliant miniature is pressed, By these stiff fingers to the cold white breast. Was this the idol of his latest thought, Pressed to a heart with early passions fraught? Or did he, as his lifestrings, one by one, Relaxed their shivering hold, or lost their tone, As the last fervent pray'r arose to heav'n, Winged with the consciousness of sin forgiven, Entreat rich consolation from above, For the wrung spirit of his gentle love? Or, as in agony his languid head Sunk down upon his cold wet dying bed, Perhaps he felt it sad to die alone, And grasp'd the shadow of that lovely one, As if its bright and loving smile had power To soothe the bitterness of such an hour. Or were she present! The fair girl who lies With anxious heart, and weary waking eyes, Unmindful of the splendour round her thrown, Musing upon her distant love alone; 'Twould well become that generous heart to break, Which could relinquish all for his dear sake. She is a rich man's daughter, yet her soul Has never own'd the enervate control Of wealth or fashion; guileless is her heart, And her whole character untouch'd by art. And as the rich and native incense flows From the deep bosom of the open rose, So from the spirit comes each word and tone, That form the language of this gentle one; While feelings that her tongue is loath to speak, Look from the clear blue eye and changing cheek, Which vary, to the heart's emotions true, From the cold marble to the carmine hue. Oh, it has been the joy of these closed eyes To watch the bright'ning beams, and varying dyes, Which answer'd still to his impassion'd words, Like faithful echoes from affection's chords. While her heart felt as if her girlhood's joys, And rich home's treasures, were but childish toys, Which it could freely, cheerfully resign For the full heart he offered at her shrine.â But that is past, and she must suffer now The pangs that only woman's heart can know; The utter desolation and despair Which only woman's heart is formed to bear. Here lies a calm-faced corpse, with silver hair, And hands close clasped as if in fervent pray'r; He was a Christian, and his latest breath Was joyful triumph o'er the conqueror, Death. His eldest son fell nobly at his side; He felt death's anguish when the brave boy died; And now his house is of all stay bereft, For girls and stripling boys alone are left. Yet, e'en for these, his soul on God relied, And full of peace, and hope, and joy, he died. His wife and children, in their peaceful home, Even now expect the war-worn one to come; And each has something treasured up to prove The fond remembrance of assiduous love. The girls, with industry and nicest care, Have manufactured garments for his wear, And each glad boy preserved from field and grove, The choicest fruits as offerings of love. While she who loved him more than all the rest, Has tender treasures hoarded in her breast; Each touching incident of household joy, And filial breathing of his fair young boy; Whate'er has given a bliss to her staid heart, And every incident that caused a smart, Are written in the sanctuary there, Half felt, till he returns, the thrill to share. Yet long and vainly shall they watch for him, Till all hearts faint and every eye grows dim; Anguish shall canker each fair daughter's bloom, While moths her offering of love consume. Each young boy's face shall beam with saddened ray, While all untasted his rich fruits decay, And in the widow's heart the unshared store Must lie a canker at its inmost core. They do not murmur at their God's decree, They bend them down in meek humility; But they have met the blight of mental pain, And the seared heart will never bloom again. So I have seen the lovely fragile flower Bend meekly down, beneath the driving shower, And when the winds were hushed, the clouds gone by, Raise up tow'rd heaven again its humid eye. But though its wonted hue the flow'ret wore, And shed its incense richly as before, Its bloom was touched, and premature decay In the bruised stem and shivered leaflets lay. Full many a human flow'r of richest bloom, Have war's fierce storms crushed early to the tomb, While thousands fall upon the field of blood, And pour life out at once in sanguine flood, Thousands are slain, who linger on for years, And waste life, drop by drop, in bitter tears. Those who lie low on this polluted plain, By war's dire implements of butchery slain, Are happier far than those whose spirits feel The wound that none can bear, that naught can heal, Which knows no solace, and can find no calm, Except in meek Religion's soothing balm. THE LITTLE BROOK. From a neat cottage by a brook, Beneath embowering trees, The lullaby of a mother's love Came sweetly on the breeze; And by that brook, so clear and bright, The early primrose grew, And bird-songs mingled with the light, And with the evening dew. And round that humble cottage door A little maiden played, Whose voice was blither than the birds Beneath her native shade; And as she cropped the primrose sweet, And laughed with infant glee, I thought that earth had naught so glad, So beautiful as she! Again I saw, beside that brook, And 'neath the same rich shade, Watching the setting summer sun, A young and blooming maid: Her soft blue eyes were full of hope, Her cheek was rosy bright, And round her lip danced all the smiles And dimples of delight! A new-blown lily's fragrant head Was nestling on her breast;â I said that earth had naught like her, So blooming and so blest! 'Twas evening by that little brook, And soft the clear moon shone, While winds came courting to the flow'r, With the Edolian toneâ And 'mid the music, light, and bloom, In full-blown beauty's pride, A maiden stood, but not alone,â Her love was by her side. And he was beautiful and strong, Brave, excellent, and free; And told his tale of love and truth, In all sincerity. I heard him ask, in soft low tone, If she would be his bride; Her eyelids veiled a world of bliss, As trembling she replied; Her cheek was brighter than the rose That blushed upon her brow; And then I thought, earth has no gift That she can covet now! Years passed; and still that little brook Flowed bright and glad along, And young primroses by its side Were list'ning to its song; And glancing wings, and joyous lays, Were floating through the shade; But where was she of other days, The little laughing maid? Or where was she, within whose breast The lily sought to hide? Whose maiden blush of love and joy The bright red rose outvied? Lo! seated on a primrose bank, Where bending osiers sigh, A lady sits, mature of years, With intellectual eye; Fashion has aided wealth to form Her costume, rich and rare, Bright gold and gems adorned her brow, But, O! 'twas marked with care! Yet she was beautiful, and blest With genius, wealth, and pow'r; And she had been in classic lands, And trod each famous shore. Now she had come to sit once more Beneath the whispering trees That nodded o'er the little brook, Conversing with the breeze; And see, she traces as she sits Warm feelings as they rise, And bending o'er the written page, She reads with tearful eyes: âDear little primrose-border'd brook, To thee the wanderer came, And thou of all she left behind, Remainest still the same! Death, time, and change have touched all else, But thou art glittering here, With the same glad and holy hymn That soothed my infant ear! Long years have passed since, full of hope, I left these simple bowers, To dance along life's golden path, Amongst exotic flowers! And I have won each brilliant boon That woman e'er can gain, And each has left within my breast, A canker or a stain! Where celebrated waters flow, And classic wreaths entwine, I've found no stream as bright as thou, No flowers so sweet as thine! And memory turns from gilded halls And fame's luxuriant bowers, To dwell with childhood's purity, And nature's own sweet flowers. Genius, and all the gems and plumes Of honour I resign; Let piety's sweet living stream And humble flowers be mine!â LINES, SUGGESTED BY THE PERUSAL OF AN ARTICLE IN THE SATURDAY MORNING VISITER, ENTITLED, âTO WEEP.â Yes, I have known what 'tis to weep! To steal at twilight hour To where the noxious nightshades creep Around the dark green bower; Where low and sad the breezes passed The dewy leaves among, And some lone bird of plaintive voice Hymned forth its evening song;â When no eye looked upon my brow, Except the lone bright star, Which shed such tender memories Of girlhood's home afar; Which gave me back the loving light Of many a speaking eye, And many a sweet familiar strain Of vocal melody. And I have wept, ah, bitterly! O'er joys for ever fled, O'er buried loves, and perished hopes, And early friendships dead; O'er almost every human ill That flesh and blood can bear, While from my wounded spirit gushed The billows of despair. And then I mused of fearful things, Of fortune's cruel sway, And of the fearful mysteries Of fate's unequal way; And felt myself an outcast bark, By treacherous tempests driven; One persecuted by the world, And almost wronged by heaven. But lo! a pitying angel came, With smile serenely calm,, And laid upon my writhing heart Some leaves of Gilead's balm. She led me to Siloah's spring, And bathed each cankered wound, And showed me where the Tree of Life With healing leaves is found; Then bade me cast away my pride, And humbly kneel and pray, And from the temple of my soul Tear all its gods away, And lay them at the Saviour's feet, Claiming the childlike mind, Which meekly says, âThy will be done,â And be my will resigned. I sought the Cross, and threw myself Beside the sacred tree; With all my idols, all my sins, With all my misery. And still I weep, but now the tears That o'er my bosom rain, Are cool and sweet, like Siloah's fount, And balm for every pain. LINES ADDRESSED TO H. F. M., ON THE DEATH OF HIS MOTHER. Mourner! shall I bid thee dry The tears of filial grief? Shall I bid thee check the sigh That gives thy heart relief? Oh, I cannot! for I know That resignation's silent tears Are balsam to the wounds of wo, Cool balm to cankering cares. Thou wilt find no love so pure As hers whose love is past; None that can so long endure, So fervent to the last. Oh, how a pious mother's love Will fondly agonize and bear, Presenting at the Throne above The object of its care. Never more to that kind breast Wilt thou confide thy caresâ That unwearied home of rest Of thine infantine years, That fond breast will throb no more With hopes, and fears, and cares for thee; Even the latest pang is o'er Of poor humanity. Closed for ever are those eyes, Whose beams of love and joy Heightened all the ecstacies Of her light-hearted boy; Thou wilt meet the sunny beam Of her approving love no more, Or bathe in that consoling stream Thy heart with anguish sore. Yet, reflect, those eyes have shed Full many a tear for thee, And many a night beside thy bed, Have watched with agony. All their watchings now are o'er, Their latest tears are dried away; And they shall wake to weep no more At the last joyful day. Though thou never more may'st hear Her kind consoling voice, Whispering softly hope and cheer, When blighted are thy joys; Though thou ne'er shall clasp again The hand that stayed thine infant head, Ministered to all thy pain, And smoothed thy cradle bed; Yet, reflect, while in the tomb Her mortal body lies, The spirit in immortal bloom Is blessed in Paradiseâ In that holier world above, Where no care, no stain can come; All her pure and tender love Lives in heavenly bloom. Wouldst thou call her back again From Heaven's ecstatic bliss, To feel the grief, the care, and pain Of such a world as this? All such selfish grief repress, And follow to the bright abode, Where thou mayst share her blessedness, Before the Throne of God. TO ANN. Look unto God, our Saviour! He careth for thee still, Though dark around thee gather The spectre forms of ill; Though all thy joys are faded, Though all thy springs are dry, Though hope's sweet harp is broken, And storms are drifting nigh. I know thy heart is breaking, I know thy brain is wrung, Though not a word of bitterness Has fallen from thy tongue; I see thee fading meekly, Like some bright summer flower, The stalk of which is wounded Past Nature's healing power. Of hearts that thou hast cherished In sunny days of old, I know that some have perished, And some are false and cold; I know that fickle fortune Has frowned upon thy way, That envy and malevolence Have marked thee for their prey. I know thou sometimes dreamest Of the white stone by the brook, O'er which the ancient cedar Its heavy branches shook; While on the moss beneath it, A few small rays of light, Like diamonds on a velvet robe, Lay flashing, purely bright. For ever it was hymning A dreamy minstrelsy, Like answer of deep waters When winds sigh lovingly; And softly from its bosom The gentle mourning dove Poured forth her pensive music Of sorrow and of love. And in thy dream thou thinkest Of summer evenings still, When the silence of the moonlight Lay bright on stream and hill, And the star that loves the evening Lay trembling in the west, Like the first holy thought of love In a young maiden's breast. Oh, pleasant are thy dreamings, For one is with thee there, In pride of manly beauty, And brow untraced by care; And, hand and heart united, Full oft in that sweet bower, Ye watched the changing loveliness Of twilight's tender hour. Ye watch'd the pencilled glories, Till every gorgeous hue Was changed to mourning drapery, Or melted into dewâ And then bright hope were gilding The west of future years, Deemed ye they too would melt away To mourning and to tears? He who was then thy lover Is on a foreign shore, The plumes of that old cedar tree Shall beckon thee no more;â And thou mayst sit at nightfall Beneath a greener tree, But the greenness of the guileless heart Can come no more to thee. 'Tis vain to weep for pleasures That never can return; O'er broken hopes and buried joys 'Tis vanity to mourn. Still onward time is speeding Along a flow'ry shore; Oh, why look backward weeping And miss the joys before? Why do we seek to garner The bliss that cannot stay, And wail for buds of beauty That bloom but to decay? Why do we think of naming The summer birds our own, And rail at heaven in autumn That such bright things are flown?â 'Twere kind to use earth's treasures As wild bees court the flowers, To draw from each a honeyed drop To cheer the wintry hours; We know that death, and sorrow, And chance, and change will come, That we are only travellers To an eternal home. Then look to God our Savir,ti And leave the world behind; Its brightest things are vanity, They cannot fill the mind; The loves of earth are fleeting, And death is ever nigh, Its richest joys, its sweetest ties Dissolving with a sigh. ON THE NEW YEAR. 'Tis past!âAnother year has signed and sealed Its complement of days. We sigh in vain, And send regret to plead with the dim past;â They never will return to us again. Each came from heaven a radiant messenger, Sent by our holy Father from above, To lead us with a gentle discipline, Toward the home of holiness and love. Have we obeyed the angel ministers, And suffered each to bring us nearer heaven?â Or have we, with a grave hypocrisy, Walked in the way with only one in seven? Or did we turn our backs upon them all, Using their precious gifts with thankless breast, And throwing from us, most ungraciously, Each wholesome fruit that had a bitter taste? And wrestling with them, when by gentle force They sought to turn our faces toward the way, Ay, wrestling! and with most rebellious words Chiding the God whose mandate they obey? Or did we take the precious things they brought, And give them to the idols we adore? To Pleasureâto Ambitionâunto Pride, Or add them unto Avarice's cankered store? If so, they will be ever unto us Accusing spirits, haunting all our ways, With mournful mien, and sad reproachful eyes, Casting their shadows on each sunny place. And in the blessed night, when we would rest Upon the balmy bosom of sweet sleep, Their shades will pass before our weary souls, And come in restless visions till we weep. And there's no angel, by kind Mercy sent, To kiss away the tears of that regret; They dim the eyeâthey eat into the cheekâ The hair grows gray on pillows they have wet. And they will point us to the dread abode, Where all the unransomed of the earth must go; Where deep Despair gnaws ever at the heart, And Deathless! is the word of deepest wo. Alas! that misspent days should haunt us thus, Mingling remorse with all our present hours; Blending low wailing notes with Hope's sweet song, And twining nightshade with all Memory's flowers, Yet still they walk beside us. Still we hear Their voices in our dreams. We plead in vainâ In vain we weep. The irrevocable Past Will never give one moment back again. No,âthough with that one moment, we might buy Eternal happiness. Our struggling prayer Returns from the inexorable gate, To crush us with one cold word, despair! But Jesus pleads with Justice. Let us come With penitence, and humble trust, and lay Our misspent days before himâpleading there That he will hide them from the judgment day. Ayâleave the Past with Jesusâand go forth To hail the New Year, with an humble joy. He comes with precious gifts of other days, Which we may be permitted to enjoy. But whether few or many shall be ours Is only to the gracious Giver known,â Oh! let us then improve the precious hours, And make the proffered blessings all our own. Yes, let us make them messengers of joy To every child of sorrow, pain, or care; Send them with Gospel light to death-dark souls, And unto God, with thankfulness, and prayer. Ah! let us fill their bosoms with warm love, For those to whom our love is happiness; And if one creature hate us, let them bear To him kind words of brotherhood and peace. So shall they walk beside us with sweet smiles, To soothe and cheer us through all time to come; Each with a band of gentle memories, And pointing to our Father's heavenly home. And when we lie upon the bed of pain, Our future with dim shadows overcast, Our present agonyâOh! sweetly then Will come these smiling angels of the past, To hover round our pillow all day long, And chase the phantoms from our reeling brain, To weave their form in all our fever dreams, And tell us that we have not lived in vain. And they will stand beside us at the day Of judgment, when all hearts shall fail with fear; When heaven shall roll together like a scroll, And the Eternal Majesty appear. Then Jesus, who shall judge the quick and dead, Shall hear and answer to their humble plea,â âCome, blessed of my Father, reign in bliss, For ye have ministered to mineâand Me.â Let us secure, against that solemn day, A crowd of these most blessed witnesses; Earth has no ransom for the sinful soul, No pleaders, but the voice of well-spent days. And oh! may every day the New Year gives, Be added to our angels, with its wreath Of Faith, and Hope, and fervent Charity, Which make our happiness, in life, or death. DEATH. Death! 'tis a fearful word To those who have no God; No interest in a risen Lord, And his redeeming blood. 'Tis dread to lie at night, By conscience sore oppressed; With everlasting wo in sight, Its tortures in the breast. Death! word of cold deep gloom To beings who profess To hope for nought beyond the tomb, But night and nothingness. To die and pass away From this bright joyous sphere, To rottenness and foul decay, Ha! what a sting is here. Death! 'tis no thought of joy To souls of sins forgiven; Who trust that they have but to die To pass from earth to heaven. For oh! the clinging ties, The child, the infant dear, The clasping hands, the grief-dim eyesâ How they would bind us here. Yet Christians fear not death; They lay them down in peace, Give God their friends, with dying breath, And pass where sorrows cease. THE SABBATH SCHOOL TEACHERS. (1838.) Who are these? a peaceful band, Meekly moving through the land; With hand unwearied, foot untired, And heart with humble fervour fired; With heavenward eye and placid cheek, Where no resentment dares to speak, Even when derided and reviled, Or met by passions fierce and wild; And when from falsehood's burning lips The cankering stream of malice drips, Although the heart may writhe with pain, It sends a blessing back again; And anger lives not in the eye Though on its lid the tear-drops lie. Patiently they trace the road To penury's obscure abode, And seek for precious treasures in The vile and loathsome haunts of sin. Who are these so mild and meek? What rich treasures do they seek? Are they in quest of high renown? Or would they win a regal crown? Or do they seek the airy bays That float upon the poet's lays? Or is it gold or worldly gain For which they feel contempt and pain. Ah! these are worthless in their eyes; They seek a nobler, holier prize. They are followers of Him Whose eyes with tears were often dim, As o'er life's rugged ways he crossed Intent to seek and save the lost. They seek the young immortal mind, The uncultured germs of human kind; The precious gems whose radiant light Lies hid in ignorance and frigid night. They seek the wretched widow's sons, The untaught labourer's little ones; The loathsome drunkard's wretched child, Whose haggard brow, and features wild, And shrinking form, and timid eye, Betrays wild fear and misery. Whose tattered garb, and naked feet, As stealthily it tracks the street, Betray the parent's sin and shame, And stamp it on the poor child's name. Of all the black and baleful clouds That wrap life's morn in mourning shrouds, The parent of inebriate thirst Entails upon his child the worst. For though its guileless bosom feel The keen contempt like barbed steel; Though it resolve to shun the fire That tortures the infuriate sire; Though Genius' germs are in the mind, And the young nature warm and kind; Though oft the little bosom ache As if the swelling heart would break; Still, still, in visitation dread Upon the drooping helpless head, In scorn, contempt, derision, lies The burden of iniquities. Some who have hearts to feel for grief, Whose hands are prompt to give relief, Pass such as vile, polluted things, Who merit all their sufferings; While happy children, from their play Will drive the ragged one away. And if in after life their name Ring from the brazen trump of Fame, Detraction in her hissing tone Will answer, âAh! the drunkard's son!â Ye who are bartering all for drink, Pause, I beseech you! pause and think; Look at your child, and think how deep The guilt for which you ought to weep. Its heart is crushed, its name is soiled, It is the drunkenâ's child. Its freeborn spirit is bent down, Debased by thine unnatural frown; Like guilty slave it walks the streets, Shunning the eyes of all it meets; Black guilt pollutes its tender years; Profanity is in its ears; Its face is pale for lack of bread, And hopeless tears its young eyes shed. Alas! for such, the orphan state Were better than their cruel fate. These the kind friends of Mercy seek, With hand so strong, and heart so meek, To lead them from their native night Into the dawn of science' light. To place their little timid feet Within her gate, where brightly meet The toilsome paths, so steep and bright, So glorious to young Genius' sight; Which lead to Wisdom's reverend mount, To Poesy's enchanted fount, To glorious Fame's resplendent gate, And all that life has, rich or great. To point them to the narrow road That leads the humble soul to God; To teach the spirit how to trace The path of happiness and peace; Fondly the infant soul to bear, Upon the breast of ardent pray'r, To Him who bids the little one Come fearlessly before his throne, And ask the grace which freely given Sheds o'er the earth the light of heaven; Enabling e'en the drundkard's child To bear its lot with spirit mild, And when reviled with words profane, Give no reviling word again, But cheerfully obedient still, Seek to perform a parent's will; Touching the heart of all who see Such patience and humility; And haply from destruction's road Winning a parent back to God. Who are these, again I ask, Who thus perform this blessed task? The toil, the burden, lies on those Who leave the bosom of repose, While early morning in the east Proclaims the holy day of rest; Whose rich instructions, gently given, Fall like the balmy dews of heaven, Which come with still, but life-fraught pow'r, Waking to bloom each embryo flow'r. The laurel wreath, and voice of fame, Confer no honours on their name, No shining coin their toil repays, Nor wear they yet poetic bays. It is enough for them to know They follow Jesus' steps below; And they receive a rich reward In the approval of the Lord, And the bright hope that many a soul Will ever bless the Sabbath School. TO THE BRITISH QUEEN. (1838.) Queen of the ocean! Thing of power, Beauty, and majesty combin'd; Speeding thy course from shore to shore, With soul of fire, and wing of wind; Riding upon the billowy deep, And proudly buffeting the waves; As fearless of the storm-wind's sweep, The waterspout, the whirlpool's cave. Thou glorious creature, speaking forth, The infinite majesty of mind; Which gave thy wond'rous fabric birth, And bade thee rule the waves and wind. Thou now art bathing in the sea, Where rolled our Fulton's little boat; How had he smiled triumphantly, To see thy perfect fabric float! Poor Fulton, while his spirit mourned, Waking by night, toiling by day; Derided, pitied, sneered at, scorned, Adventurous Genius' destiny; Deem'd he, amid his hopes and fears, That every lake and noble stream Of this broad land, ere thirty years, Should own the potent power of steam? That such a glorious thing as thou, Of peerless mould and royal name, Shouldst cross the ocean to bestow A splendid laurel to his fame? Yet so it is. In bed of sand Soft Indolence his name may trace; Poor Genius, with a weary hand, Inscribed the everduring brass! Proud floating castle of the deep, Heaven speed thee on thy homeward way; For even thee, His hand must keep Who holds the reins of destiny. Rich emblem of the royal maid, Whose blazoned title suits thee well, A songstress from Columbia's shade, A warbler of the wild-wood dell, I bid thee God speed, and with thee bear To her who rules by land and flood, The echo of a woman's prayer, Breathed in the free, eternal Wood. That she may find the gallant bark, Whose onward course 'tis hers to guide Along the current, strong and dark, Of Time's resistless billowy tide, Able to baffle wind and wave, With mighty engine, gallant crew, Impervious hull, and rigging brave, And gilding glorious to the view; Steady and upright on her way, Queen of the Ocean, as of yore; Obedient to her gentle sway, And bright with honour, evermore. May He who rules o'er ships and worlds, Smooth the rough ocean for her prow, And guide her safe o'er shoal and whirl, When breakers roar beneath her bow. For pilot's care, and helmsman's skill, And sails and anchors, all are vain, Unless His hand be present still, To guide the vessel o'er the main. God speed thee! Britain's royal maid, Thou young and lovely Queen of Hearts! Give thee his wisdom to thine aid, And shield thee from misfortune's darts. Make peace and joy thy diadem, And wreath it high with power and fame, While piety's resplendent gem, Sheds o'er thy brow its heavenly flame. Preserve thee humble, pure, and good, While long and glorious years of time Shall waft thee o'er life's stormy flood To joy's serene and holy clime. THE END.</field>
