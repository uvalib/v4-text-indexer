      <field name="fulltext">THE DESTRUCTION OF SODOM. Night's curtains are dissolving, and the dawn Rolls up its billowy brightness in the East: The plains of Mamre glow; and every stream— From Zoar, to the blue mountains that afar Their kingly peaks are lifting,—touched with fire, Gives gentle music to the gush of morn— A morn whose gleam, eclipsed and red like blood, Opes on the affrighted cities of the plain As lightnings to the houseless traveller's eye, When he, belated, meets on dismal heath The desolating storm. The sun is risen: The shadow only of his God, he walks Upward unto the zenith, painting throngs Of clouds, in gold and purple, that essay To check the glory of his onward way. The sun is risen—but to that lidless eye, Glaring in heaven, is interposed a bound Which leaves no smile beyond; a bound of night, And deep, immingling gloom; where, save the hue On pale, tempestuously shifting folds Of ceaseless-moving clouds, there dawns no day; But changeful darkness, gloomier made, by change That no distinctness owns, seems gathering round, Touched with a fitful crimson; like some stain, By watch-fires seen upon a murderer's robe, When evening wolves disturb the spell of peace That wraps the midnight forest glooming round. Sodom, thine hour is come! Thy streets no more What time the sunset's cloudy banners fade, And early stars hold vigil in the sky, Will call the child of lust, to bide the time Of foul appointment with some kindred soul, In mutual guilt immured. No more for thee The tabor or the timbrel e'er shall breathe Voluptuous numbers on the breeze's wing, Or the polluted dance at eve go round. Thine hours are numbered, Sodom! and the throngs That crowd thy streets will sink to sleep no more, O'erwearied by the natural weight of sin, When revels and the wassail feasts are done. Thine hour is come, oh Sodom! from afar, Like locust tempests o'er Egyptian land, The veil of Death is moving: on the gale Mephitic vapours roll: now, quaking forms, Rising from attic casements, mark the morn, Struggling and scarlet-hued; and strive in vain To pierce the boundary of that cestus grim Which binds the plain's proud cities. Bow thee down, Oh Sodom; let thy denizens in dust Enrobe themselves, and sackcloth; for their sins Have cried to Heaven until the Eternal's ear Can hear those earnest prayers and groans no more, Sent up for thine and thee. No goodly ten, With souls unstained, within thy walls remain— There Guilt's imperial reign extends alone. Hark! in that knolling thunder's distant sound Thy funeral hours are boded! Hark, again, Affrighted cities! Bend the attentive ear Of sense, and heart, and soul! God walks abroad— His voice directs the whirlwind, and His power Marshals those gloomy companies of clouds, Whose inmates dangers are; whose smile, the ray That lights the course of death. Howl, Sodom, howl; For never more on earth, beyond this hour, Thy spires shall look in mockery to heaven; Thy streets be tenanted, thy dwellings gay, Or thy tall gates unbroken. Doom, despair And quick destruction wait thy busy throngs, That in the gray light wander to and fro: Those long, long streets, whose domes and temples high The inconstant lightnings show—these, each and all, Before the mid-day sun shall from his tower Look forth upon the world, in gloom will lie— In ruin, and in darkness, which nor sun, Nor the chaste silver moon, nor countless stars, Fretting the vault of night with paly gold, Can e'er again illumine. Still onward walks the tempest, and its edge, In undulations huge, is flecked with fires, Like fabled serpent's twine; in flashing wreathes, And forms of burning stripes athwart the clouds, They dart inconstant; now the warring winds Rise from their hidden caverns; and their voice Comes with hot fervours from the lowering veil That sweeps the gloom afar, and shuts the plain, And all its cities from that solar light, Which bathes in radiant joy the world beyond. Gaze over Sodom! On the house-tops risen, Are many multitudes; the shifting light, Red, but inconstant, paints their tossing arms, And pallid brows, with hues that seem as blood. The thunder's swelling volume of deep sound Shakes o'er tall spires and pillared temples gray, Till their vast halls and porticoes seem rent By some invisible hand. Sublime on high, Those voiceful sounds resistless boom along, As heavy waves each other chase, and beat The encumbered ocean strand. Now bursts the stooping storm. Around, above, And deep beneath, the Almighty's power appears From zenith to the centre—now, the plain Shudders for many a league; and every street In every city, deluged o'er with fire, A liquid stream, sends up its line of light; And thick discoloured smoke, in volumes wide, Rolls heavenward, like some vast, embodied Sin, Wrapt in its folds of dun. Across the ways, With sandals burnt and stained in running flame, Delirious numbers rush—while from above, Red torrents, pouring from consuming roofs, With bickering hiss, descend: thousands fall down And die, despairing aid from God or man. Heart-rending shrieks from every mansion rise— Pale, blasted leaves flit through the darkened air, Swept from suburban bowers; the howl of winds And bubbling voices, choaked with gusts of flame— The knell of rolling thunders, and the crash Of fanes by lightning smitten, rise around In dire confusion mingled; till at last, Dissolved in one dark ruin, all the plain, A smouldering level lies, without a sign, Or murmur of existence, save the groan Of some scathed wretch, just lingering o'er the abyss That parts a dread eternity from time. Sunlight is on the mountains, and the gale Stirs the gray locks of Abraham, and his beard Waves white upon his bosom, as he stands And looks from Mamre, towards Gomorrah's waste, And the lost cities of that gloomy plain. Faint rumblings tremble in his aged ear, Borne from that fated land; as spreading wide Like a vast funeral pall above the scene, The smoking surges rise, to bar the sun From all the mournful sights which they enfold. Yet all around and far, that pall beyond The vivid morning lies; the vales, the hills, Kadesh, and Shur, and Gerar, drink its rays In the serene “south country:” every stream Flashes its silver sheen by verdant shores, And emerald greenness laughs on field and tree; While, in the extended view, the patriarch sees Comparison, in nature pictured forth, Betwixt the Almighty's vengeance and his smile. But where are they Who laughed, at yester-even, when the day Paled all its gorgeous richness in the west, And bade the twilight hour array the stars Along the cope of heaven? Where are they, Who sought the angels, nigh to Sodom's gate, And spurned them, unaware? Where the crowd, The shout, the song, the jeer, and all the guilt That fired so many hearts? Gone to the grave! From countless lips, all red at yestermorn, And prompt in uttering guile, have rushed away The moans of dissolution; o'er each cheek, Then glowing like the rose in summer bower, Hath passed a fear-born pallor, midst the storm Whose every drop woke anguish as it fell! Mock not thy God, vain man! for in the flush Of pleasure, and the fulness of its dream; When thy gay soul looks downward from its source And seeks its low desires, without an aim, Delighted with iniquity—e'en then The tempest of a retribution sure, Is gathering from afar. This vale of earth Is like the Plain of Sodom. Doom and death, O'er all its borders hang; and he alone, Who sees, with faith's clear eye, the land of rest— The city which no mortal hands have made— Who views the pinnacles and domes of light, Bathed ever in the rays of sunny gold— The gates of pearl, and walls of flashing gems, Girding that place of refuge—he, alone, Who walks in sweet communion with his God, Is safe amid this wilderness of wo. Philadelphia, 1834. THE PEACE OF GOD. Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you: let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. John, XIV. 27. Thus spake the blessed Lord, When the Last Supper's sacred hour was done; And each reviving word Came, like rich incense from an altar-stone: Kind, from those holy lips, so soon to breathe Their last forgiveness forth, and taste the cup of death. ‘Peace, peace I leave with you!’ Thus to his flock the glorious Shepherd said; And, pure as morning dew On Hermon's mount, or marge of Jordan shed, A spell descended on the group around— A charm of kindling hope—of confidence profound. “My peace to you I give, Won from the immortal home of bliss above, Where the redeemed shall live, In many mansions of eternal love;— Peace, like its radiant source, serene and calm, Where flowers unblighted bloom, and all the air is balm. “Not as the world bestows Its fleeting gifts, I yield my peace to you; No clouds of death can close Around my Father's house, or dim the view Where fadeless lustre fills the gorgeous sky, And sinks into the soul, and lights the enraptured eye. “And there, where golden rays Play on still waters, and in pastures green, The eternal Father strays; His voice like music haunts each sunny scene— A pleasant odour floats where'er he moves, A sense of pure delight—a pomp of heavenly loves. “Earth has no fount of peace: Sins, sicknesses and death, begird it round; Its hopes untimely cease, And baseless dreams its dim dominion bound; Here fond Affection no repose can gain, And the gaunt miser hoards his gold in vain. “Here, sorrow comes to all— For pale Mortality his standard rears Beside the bier and pall; And smiles are quenched in unavailing tears; To Joy's light laugh succeeds the weary sigh, And no sweet rose may blossom, but to die. “Then, with untroubled heart, Look upward to yon home to which I go; And ere I yet depart From toil, and suffering, and death below, Let my farewell of peace your steps attend— ‘I go, to meet in heaven my Father and your Friend.’” And thus the Saviour died! Thus, to the hill of blood, he went his way, And there was crucified, While a world's guilt upon his bosom lay. How should that risen Lord be praised and blest, Who drained the dregs of wo, to give us peace and rest! EARLY PIETY. Is it not sweet, to see The brow of childhood brightened with the love, Which comes, in purity, From the rich fountain of delight above: Which cannot fail or die, and knows no end— Bestowed in ceaseless gifts, and by a deathless friend? And is it not a joy, From balmy lips the words of prayer to hear, The spirit's best employ, Like music melting on the enchanted ear? To note the early journeyings of the soul, Up to its source and home, beyond the world's controul? To mark the yielding heart Turn from the blandishments of earth and time, To choose “the better part”— A treasure, all unsullied and sublime, Beyond the stain of death or blight of sin— Which pours upon the soul a flood of rapture in? How fair, when life is new, On youth's soft cheek the blooming roses lie! Then, to the ardent view All scenes are lovely, and delight the eye: Each pulse is novel in the happy breast, And with a slumber light the evening couch is pressed. Then o'er the earth and sky A glory and a gleam of newness play: The endless void on high Spreads its blue glory to the blaze of day; A gorgeous radiance gilds the field and stream, And smiling nature wears the beauty of a dream. In that rejoicing prime Of hope and golden thoughts, the heart aspires Beyond the bound of time, And high to heaven uplifts its fond desires; Ah, then, how sweet to hear the gentle prayer Float softly upward, through the twilight's holy air! Then, when the mind is new, Before the shades of care bedim the brow; When all things to the view, In hues of beauty and effulgence glow: Then should the visions of the soul arise, And catch the living glow that fills the upper skies! For it is thus the heart Is strengthened for the trial-hours to come, When childhood shall depart, And its rich garlands lose their sunny bloom; When many griefs the mournful brow shall cloud, And cares, to youth unknown, around the spirit crowd. Thus is the bosom taught That lesson of delight, which lifts the soul Up to the source of thought, Whose splendours round its soaring pinions roll; Beyond the brightness of the golden sun, From stores of boundless light and living glory won! And it is thus, the tomb Is robbed of terror, and a ray divine Beams on its lonely gloom,— Making its pale recess a radiant shrine, Where kindred hearts should rather sing than weep, That there the holy dead in peace triumphant sleep. Where, for the funeral hymn, Or wail of grief, the chant of praise should swell, That then, no longer dim, The lofty spirit fenced with clay should dwell; But rise exulting, and with angels, blend Its anthems and its hopes, in bliss that knows no end! This is the priceless boon— The promise offered, and the high reward, To that true heart, which soon, In young existence, seeks the Blessed Word: Let but the breast on that broad promise lean, And life's dark cares are nought, and every trying scene. Thus, shorn of power, the toil, And heat, and burden of its day are brief; And then, beyond the spoil And scathe of time, the spirit finds relief: From earth's Aceldema it turns away, And basks in visions bright of heaven's eternal day! There, where nor cloud, nor gloom The vernal soil or brilliant sky o'ersweep, All the redeemed shall come, With crowns unfading and affection deep; And see life's crystal river roll along, And hear the tuneful notes of many an angel-song! Can childhood thus be taught In early days that blessed path to tread, Which maketh sorrow naught, And thornless flowers on every side can spread? Can fond parental love that path descry, And point its beauty forth to youth's inquiring eye? Then, let the way be shown— And when its onward track is duly found, And to sweet children known, Their little footsteps light should “print the ground;” So, when their race is ended, they may hear A Saviour's welcome breathed, within the dying ear! A welcome, like the one Which, at Capernaum, on earth he spake, When God's incarnate Son,— And bade his friends love children for his sake; He spread their guileless ways and charms to view, And said, “like them in heart, be simple, pure and true.” Thus reared, a tender child The newness of its soul, till death, may keep, Serene, and undefiled; Bright shall its day-dreams be, and calm its sleep: And when the twilight of decline shall come, A band of seraph forms will guide the spirit home. And in the courts above, The Father and the Friend, with smile benign, Shall in his kindness move, And greet that spirit in his realms divine; And midst a scene no mortal eye can see, Speak the fond words of love—“Ye children, come to me!”</field>
