      <field name="fulltext">VALERIAN. A NARRATIVE POEM. BOOK I. Far in the east, washed by the restless wave, Montalvia spreads her bold and fruitful shores: There dwelt a people little known to fame, But brave and hardy. No historic page Has held their picture to succeeding years, Nor told those customs, those historic deeds, Those early scenes of love, which might instruct The children of a distant age and clime. From Thuscan origin this people sprang. A wandering tribe, they left their native fields In search of other climes, and on those shores, Which they Montalvia called, they reared their tents, And formed their homes. Time, as she flew, increased Their number and their strength, and introduced The arts, to ornament their domes, their walls, Their wide-spread cities, and their waving fields; To brighten all the joys of social life. Through the long waste of time, O let me look On those wild regions, on their waving woods, On their high rocks, beat by unceasing storms! Rise to my view embodied forms of men; And hither, airy Fancy, speed thy flight; Unroll thy record; whisper to my ear Thy burning thoughts; lend me thy wings, and bear Me over tracts unvisited by man! Thy fairy visions oft have met my eyes, When musing in the dark of solitude And night; oft, listening to thy wayward dreams, I've followed thee o'er cloud-capt hills, o'er streams, O'er plains, o'er scorching sands, o'er unsunned snows, O'er deserts nightly vexed by stormy blasts: Now be my guide once more, and let my song Prove not unworthy of thy varying powers, And not unpleasing for the world to hear! A man revered within Montalvia lived, Alcestes named low bowed with weight of years. He by his king was held in honour, love; By all his wide-spread tribe in reverence held For mild demeanour. He vaunted that his eye Pierced far into the' oblivious past, and scanned The map of onward time; that Heaven to him Revealed all secret things, from others hid; That oft, at midnight, to his hallowed ear Some heaven-sent minister, in whispers soft, Told him the will of those who rule o'er men. Far in a glade, beneath a mountain's brow, Stood the low mansion of this aged seer. Some mossy trees bent over his rude cot, And swinging to the winds their giant arms, Made music like the dashing of the sea. A bed, some rushy seats, a lumbering chest, Composed the scanty furniture within. Upon the hearth, with some dry fuel piled, A watch-dog slumbered, grey with many years: Attendant on Alcestes, his fond master, And grateful to the hand which gave him food, He slumbered only where the old man lay, And followed him in all his museful walks. An only child watched the declining age Of this kind man; Azora was she called: A fairer maid no fancy ever formed. Time had flown by, and numbered eighteen years Since on her birth her happy father smiled. Her form was moulded by the softest grace; Roved o'er her face bewitching smiles, and o'er Her shoulders fell a shining flood of hair. No step so lightly as Azora's moved In the gay gambols to the tabor's sound, When yellow moonlight slept upon the hills. Skilled was her father to draw music forth From strings that, likest those of airy harp, Breathed ravishing and sad mellifluence; And he had taught his daughter all his art; And oft, when twilight stole upon the vale, And in her steps enamoured Silence came, Azora's harp was heard, Azora's voice Companioning, far sweeter than its own. On the still cottage of Alcestes rose The dawning smile, the brightening tints of morn. Propped by his staff, and followed by his dog, He bent his footsteps to the neighbouring shore: For still on nature he delighted looked, Mused o'er a world of grandeur, drear and wild, With raptured thought; and yet his eye reposed As fondly on the calmly, softly fair. Arrived, he clambered 'midst the jutting rocks, And leaning thoughtfully upon his staff, Gazed on the waters rolling at his feet. While wrapt in meditation thus he stood, A cloud obscured the beams of early day, The winds uprose, the angry Caspian raved, And hove his billows higher in the blast. Thus high above the elemental war, The sage stood museful, muttering to the winds The burthens of his heart and wayward dreams, When suddenly and oft his ears were pierced By the loud barking of his faithful dog. Curious to know the cause, he turned his steps, And sought his dog, whom at the water's edge, Pawing the sand, he found, and on the surge Bending a wistful and inquiring look: When lo! the sage, lifting his eyes, beheld A man, whom waves had cast upon the shore, With members cold and stiff, bereft of life. Youthful he seemed, and noble in his form; His face and uncouth raiment plainly spoke A stranger, from some distant coast unknown. Alcestes raised him in his aged arms, Hoping that life was not quite flown beyond The strenuous call of his health-giving art; And aid obtaining, gently bore away To his low cot, and to his rushy bed. Nor was the hope deceitful, nor his call Inefficacious. Soon he noted life, Yet tremulous, within the clay-cold breast. With generous care he and his daughter nursed The unknown wand'rer; watched they o'er his couch; By every gentle healing art they wooed His lingering spirit back; and back it came. When first he oped to the fair light his eyes, He saw Alcestes and Azora bending, With anxious eyes and piteous, o'er his bed, And heard their cry of joy to see him live. Astounded he beheld them, and in voice But faint and scarcely audible, inquired, “In what place he was cast, in what strange land, And who the friends who saved a wretched wight, To wanderings born, to hardships, and to tears?” Kindly the venerable man replied: “Quiet, O stranger! every doubt and fear, The winds have cast thee in the house of friends. I snatched thee from the flood, I brought thee hither, And joy to see thee live and speak again. Receive then, youth, whate'er my cell bestows; Mine and my daughter's hands shall give thee food And drink, and watch thy couch till strength returns. Rest, stranger, rest in peace till time restore Joy to thy heart, and vigour to thy limbs.” The old man's prayer was heard; his guest's pale cheek Was visited again by dews of health. A few succeeding days nerved his bold arm Again with all its wonted strength. He lived To thank his kind preserver for his care, To lavish blessings on his silver head. By more acquaintance more his heart was linked To his protecting friends; knit were their souls In bonds of union undissolvable. Communing oft, the stranger asked the seer For tidings of the land before him spread, To him unknown, and now his place of rest. What race, he asked, sojourn in these long vales, Or harbour in the hills I see remote? And who their judges, kings, and incensed gods? To whom the sage, in accents mild, replied: This realm, O stranger, fame reports afar; Its kindly soil rewards the ploughman's toil, And gives rich harvests to industrious hands: Green vallies meet the gladdened view; and streams Profusely flow through fields, and fill the air With coolness, and with murmurs musical. In shadowy lawns the shepherd's pipe is heard To call the swains and rustic maids to sport, While blows the gale embathed in wholesome dews, And sweetly wanders o'er their heads the moon, And throws her silver lustre in their paths. Oft from the thicket, at the still of night, Or mountain's side, the wildered peasant hears A voice of melody, more soft and shrill Than shepherd's reed, to which the fairy tribes Lead on the dance, and hold their mystic rites. Montalvia's children are a race devout, And sacred domes they rear to many a God, In Ombecilla, their imperial seat. Their God of Gods is great Oasis. He Lives in bright palaces above the skies; His eye looks farther than his sun's beam goes; His voice is thunder; and his nod shakes worlds. The morning is his smile, the storm his wrath; He knows the ways of men; approves the good, But looks indignant on the bad; and when The good man dies, he wafts him to his halls, Where shines a blissful day that never sets: But when he sweeps the bad man from the earth, He thrusts the struggling ghost, through gaping rift, Far into earth's vast womb, where darkness dwells, With other guilty souls, an endless doom. Oasis and his vassal Gods befriend The good: but there are Gods malign, his foes, And foes of all good men, and foes of joy. Evil is their good, and groans their music sweet: Death is their sport, and blood their banquet best; They blow man's frantic passions into rage, And goad his footsteps on to midnight deeds; They loose the hell-hounds of unending strife. And rain on earth diseases, plagues, and death. Frequent on altars are the victims laid, As offerings to the Gods. Those who are kind, Benevolent, and just, and friends of men, Are honoured with the sacrifice of lambs. From these their votaries seek the smile of peace, The fruitful field, the sky without a storm, The richest blessings of indulgent heaven. To stern malignant deities are slain The beasts congenial to their savage mind: The bull, the tyger, wild boar of the wood; And oft the warrior youth, the blooming maid, Are offered to appease their deadly rage. O'er wide Montalvia Oriander reigns, Raised by the people's voice to kingly state. Of stature huge he is, of temper fierce, But brave, and skilled to rule o'er restless men. His hue is swarthy; his deep-seated eyes Throw glances on his foes that check their steps, And shoot a dizzy terror through their brain. Alike terrific are his step and mein: He moves as he well knew his high desert. As one born to subdue. When wronged, his wrath Is like the ocean, when in rage he heaves Most high his billows of destruction; yet Not tearless nor unmoved by woe is he, And generous deeds are not unknown to him. He loves his race; and threescore years have rolled Since he has ruled them wisely in his love, Fought all their battles, and engrossed their dangers. Oft, in their songs, the poets of the land Teach youthful ears and credulous, that their king Has sprung from Gods, and is to Gods allied In wisdom and in strength, and ne'er to die. The king assents, and his best gifts enrich The tuneful authors of his deity. Gondalbo is the monarch's only son, A son, alas! unworthy of his sire. No generous passions warm his sullen soul, But full of guile and cruelty is he; In war the first, but last in arts of peace; His dark eye rolls in wiles; his scowling glance Gives presage of the' unquiet soul within; Strong and beast-like his lusts, that, when provoked, Will tread their perilous paths neck-deep in blood. Oft does the father with a stern rebuke Chastise the son; but still his stubborn will Breaks through restraint; his overbearing pride Scorns the keen lash, and throws the rein aside. Yet of Gondalbo highly deem the sons Of war, and wild adventure's restless bands: A numerous host of such, with ill intent, He wins, and binds them to some desperate cause. Strong in her men, and proud in wealth and arts, Fair Ombecilla stands, and heaves her walls And battlements high in the airy realms. A towered wall hems in her eastern side, Her treasures guarding from irruption rude; The wide-spread Caspian laves her western skirts; The banks are fenced by rocky pinnacles, On which the strong-winged eagle builds his nest, And safely mues his ravenous young in blood; And hence the eye would sicken as it gazed On the dark waters refluent at their foot. Within these bounds seven gorgeous fanes arise, With altars flaming to the country's Gods. On a near hill, o'ertopped with spiry trees, The fane of great Oasis proudly stands, And looks down on the city and the plains. Awe-struck and reverend are the eyes that gaze Upon its walls, gigantic and eternal, Its glittering domes, and its columnar gates, That catch the dawning beams of orient day. Its courts at yearly festivals are thronged By wondering crowds, whom a divine command Calls from the utmost bounds, the circuit wide, Of Altai's endless vales and long-drawn slopes. Within the walls the roving eye is lost 'Midst waving hangings, and the sounding aisles, 'Mid sculptured forms, and godlike pageantry; There meets the sight an altar to the God Whom most they love; there oft the victim slain Encrimsons with its blood the priestly hand; There oft the roof re-echoes to the voice Of prayer, to hymns and instrumental sounds. An aged priest, Abassus called, presides, In robes of white, and pomp pontifical: Next to the king in honour is he held; His voice in council is esteemed most wise. His beard of snow falls reverend o'er his breast, And gravity sits throned upon his brow. Childless is he, for jealous Gods refuse To share his heart with earth-begotten cares. He tends a taper's solitary ray, That trembles on the temple's dusky walls, And whose pure flame, with oils ambrosial fed, Must never die; for in that death would sink King, priest, and votary, halls, and fanes, and fields, Gulphed, at the instant, in one yawning grave. In narrow cell, these hallowed walls within, In holy trance he sits, to watch the pledge Of universal safety glimmering near; Save when the king, a gorgeous train attending, Comes to the temple to partake the rites Ordained by great Oasis, when the sun Sets out anew upon his yearly read. Around the sacred fane the tombs of kings, For virtue, warlike or pacific, famed, Who lived to save their country, or who died, Are built, with emblems and with trophies decked. The precincts unprofaned spread far and wide Around these walls; a woody wilderness, A forest of primeval growth, the ground Shadows with leafy canopy obscure. The city's din, by distance rendered sweet, Strikes the sad ear of him who roves beneath, And keeps alive the holy mystic flame. Hard by the broken cliff which skirts the flood The kingly palace stands, in towered state, And frowns defiance on the war of years; A limpid stream, that through the city flows, Mixes in rushing cadence with the sea. Ah, sweet Hyphasis! natal fountain sweet, May never hostile footsteps bathe in thee, And ne'er rude battle mingle with thy murmur! Well pleased, the maids of Ombecilla bathe Their fervid temples and their floating hair In thy enamoured wave; and chief I love To gaze in thy broad mirror at the skies, While many a bark, at evening's peaceful hour, Skims lightly o'er thy wave, and all thy shades Give echo to the oar and oarman's song. Hyphasis and her far-spread arms bestow, Without the walls, oe'r wide-extending plains, O'er many a waving field, luxuriance green; Abundance laughs around; the lowing herds Are heard among the vales; the clambering goats Look from the hillock's brow; and bleating flocks Crop the green meadows, and repose in shades; While from beneath each branching fir looks out The cottage roof, in sweet and humble guise. The plains are gladdened by the jocund voice Of shepherd, calling to his errant flock, The pipe's shrill music, and industrious sounds. Skirting the north, a chain of mountains spreads, That with their blue heads pierce the passing clouds. No culture tames the fierceness of their soil; The larch-tree climbs their steep and rocky side; And there a ruffian horde in old time dug Their darksome dens, and thence, e'en now, are wont, At night's still hour, to come in search of spoil, And led by thirst of blood. These bands are led By Artaban, of giant port, and skilled In wiles, and all the robber's artifice. His arm descends like some high falling tower On the sad stranger wandering in the dark; And, like a whirlwind, in his wrath he sweeps Unsheltered villages, unguarded flocks. Grim-visaged man! none but the brave can meet The terrors of his dark and flashing eye, Or mark the bend of his o'ershadowing brows; His stride is dreadful to the field of strife, And his dark armour fear-strikes hosts of men. He as a God leads forth his vassal clan; His anger slays, his nod dispenses life; He bids, and they who dare to faulter, straight Are piecemeal hewn by his indignant sword, And thrown to blood-hounds to regale their thirst. He tramples under foot the power of kings, And walks secure 'midst ambush, and o'er mines. Loud Rumour is most busy with his name; It is her trade to bruit in our ears His marvellous feats in council and in war. She tells us how a troop of fiery youth, Five banded thousands were they, culled with care From out the hardy sons of southern hills, Assailed him, whom they single, shieldless found, At his spare meal, in bottom of a cave. Alas! their leagued swords availed them naught Against his iron arm; they fell in heaps, Like grass before the scythe; he thinned their files, Till slaughter-weary, or with pity touched, His hand forbore; and bounding o'er the heads Of those who fled, he vanished clean away. A pilgrim clambering o'er the rocks, benighted, Sought shelter from the storm within his cave. Artaban then was prowling on the plains. The stranger, wearied, threw himself to rest On some dry leaves, and closed his eyes in sleep. Not long he slumbered, when the piercing voice Of signal-horn was heard. He waked and saw, Entering the cave's rude door, the scowling chief. The pilgrim started from his leafy bed. His dress and aspect told his name, and now Not e'en to supplication did the wretch Betake himself, for Artaban spared none, And fame through every land had blown the sound. The chief quick darted at the' intruder eyes Of fierce suspicion; from his sheath outflew The sword that fear-struck mortals deem divine. But paused the chief, and while his fiery eyes Roved o'er the figure of the trembling man, His tattered raiment, snowy front, and back By age bent double, he his rage dismissed. In accents mild he bade the pilgrim stay, Rest on his leaves the night, and break his bread, Sprinkled with sacred salt. When day returned, In decent weeds he clothed him, his slow steps He guided safely through the thicket's maze; The track of men regained, he bade God speed. Far in the utmost west, and faintly seen From Ombecilla's tallest pinnacle, The hills are robed in forest that spreads wide, O'er many a league, its silence and its shade. The traveller wandering through its trackless vales Loses the sun's blest guidance, and in vain His eyes are upward turned, in vain they seek The lode-star's sparkling ray, or zenithed moon; No sounds of kindly import greet him; beasts That prey on men beset him, and their roar With rushing torrents a dread concert keep. Here oft come hunters, armed for sylvan war, More perilous than the strife of spear with spear: With hounds, and horn, and steeds in panoply, They come to rouze the monster from his den. Here oft the prince, with well appointed band, Keen for the arduous sport, doth beat the shades, Where lions, respited from hunger, crouch. And here the springing tyger he encounters; And numerous are the spoils of panthers grey, Of brindled lioness, and speckled pard, And antlered hind, that deck his ghostly halls. And such unthrifty warfare, such rude sport, Next to man-killing, most delights his soul. Blood slakes his thirst; the cry of agony More sweetly wooes his ear than harp, or voice Of choral angels; writhing pangs of babes, Pierced by steel-headed arrows, feast his eyes, More richly than the rose, whose crimson dyes The cheek of virgin, when her bridal lamp Is lighted, feasts the eye of him she loves. Deep bosomed in these woods, in ancient time, There stood a fane, to the great mother earth By hands devout up-reared; a hill's broad top It crowns, and circling torrents rush around. 'Twas once a mansion, walled full high and strong; Within were sightly halls and doors embossed; But now, of all but old renown bereft, It stands a tottering crumbling ruin, grey With moss, and clad with ivy, and the yew Shades its high altars; gape forlorn its groves, Defaced and empty: for the gods that held The sway o'er Ombecilla's infant years, Their hill-top fanes, their pageantry, their priests, Have vanished; and new gods, new priests, new rites, Have filled their place: a worship brought from far By pilgrim sages, whom the learned South Bred in her courts, and with persuasion armed. These grassy halls, unwindowed and unroofed, Are fit for meditation; museful steps Would love to rove amid these mouldering aisles, To ponder on old time, man's fitful life, And death that levels all things, if the haunt Were empty of all beings else, and free From lurking mischief. But not so: for deep In narrow cell, within these bounds immured, There sits a hoary wight, deep versed in arts Of direful magic, potent to controul Great Nature's kingdom. There, on stony couch Reclined, he reads Contingency's vast book. To those who dare the perils of the wood, And homage pay to necromantic power, He opes his lips, expounding destiny. Great is the peril, for not beast alone, But savage man, prowls round this dark retreat; Wild men, and artless but in feats of war, Slow to all kindness, but to vengeance swift; With tongues unbroken to obsequious curb, With arms by rustic labour unsubdued, The Morglan hides his spoil amidst these hills. Ere Thusca and his children reached these shores, From hill to sea this roaming race diffused Their ill-compacted tribes: hence to Montalvia's sons They bear the hatred due to hostile men Who robbed them of their fair and wide domain. Unending war they wage, and oft molest, By violent incursion, e'en the walls Of Ombecilla, and their brazen trump Shakes all her hearts; but oftener have they found Graves in the fields their sword and brand had wasted. And oft, the tide of war against them flowing, The vengeful sword of Thusca's sons have left Nought but a meagre remnant of the race, To rue their mad ambition, and to brouze On Nature's poor provision, cooped in rocks. Alcestes ceased, and with him ceased the day. Now o'er the city, o'er the plains, descend, Long-drawn, the mantle, dew-besprent, of Eve; The moon-beams tremble on the Caspian wave; The hum of men, the bay of dogs, is hush'd. Sleep comes to heal all wounds: come then to me; And thou O Muse, seal thy inspired lips. The tenants of the cot to rest betake Their weary limbs; Valerian on his couch Sunk in soft slumbers, not unvisited Of dreams, that whispered of futurity. END OF BOOK I. BOOK II. The jocund morning rose: from his high hill The sun looked down, and gladdened all the plain; Nature awakened from her still repose, And, starting, shook the dew-drops from her robe. The happy inmates of Alcestes' cot From slumbers broke, and hailed the blush of day: Assembling round the social board, they joined In conversation sweet and unrestrained. Anxious for him whose life he had preserved, Alcestes asked his guest whence he had come; To what far region he designed his course, When he was cast upon these eastern shores. To whom the youth in accents mild replied: Kind reverend father, nought shall I withhold From one to whom protection, life are due. My tale will not detain your patience long; And nought it has to please or interest, Unless it meet an interest in your love. Valerian I am called; I came from Rome; I left a father in those splendid walls; I fled from persecution, pain, and death: For I, of christian faith, was hunted down By tyrants, thirsting for the blood of those Who would not own the idol gods they serve, And on their altars burn their sacrifice. My memory turns in horror from the scenes Which I have witnessed in the walls of Rome; My soul is sick when I recal the rage Which breathed destruction on the friends of Christ; Which followed them with chains, with sword and fire, With deaths most exquisite, with glutted shouts. O why delayed the thunders of my God? Why slept the arm of his almighty wrath? Ah! he, with wise and merciful designs, Allowed to impious men a short-lived joy, To show more signally his ruling power! Ye streets which flowed in torrents with the blood Of brethren butchered in the public view! Ye midnight cells which listened to their groans! Ye flames which lit the horrors of the night, And gave their tortures to the startled eye! Ye theatres which saw them torn by beasts, And oft resounded with the pressing throngs, Who gazed delighted on the horrid sight!— Bear witness to the cruel, damning deeds, Of Rome's fell tyrant and his wretched slaves! Attentive to his words, Alcestes asked Who were those Christians? by what faith disjoined From those relentless men who sought their lives? To which the youth continuing thus replied: The God who made all men, who all preserves, Beheld in pity our deluded race Plunged in distress, in error, and in sin; And, from his throne of glory in the skies, Sent down a messenger to dwell with men, To be a light to this sad darkened world, To show to us the paths of truth and peace, To suffer and to die that we might live. This holy being was the Son of God; By him were made the mighty worlds, which roll Amidst the regions of unbounded space. He spake, 'twas done, all nature took its birth, The heavens were spread, the solid earth stood firm, And dashed the billows of a thousand seas. Christ was the name which this Messiah bore: Equal was he to the paternal God, In power, in wisdom, and in grace divine. A few years back, this God most high appeared On earth, and took the lowly form of man. In poverty and sorrow he was nursed; He wandered as an outcast in the world, Which he had made, which moves at his command. He bore with patience, and without a murmur, The persecutions and the scorn of men; With willing hand he took the cup of woe, Exhausted to its dregs the bitter draught, And, in atonement for the sins of men, To justice rendered satisfaction full. When thirty years had seen this God on earth, He then began to publish to the world His name divine, his messages of grace. He spake as man before him never spake; Revealed the will and councils of our God, By mighty works proclaimed his peerless power, And bade the world, woe-wearied and benighted, To follow him, to reverence his commands, And he would lead them on to better worlds, Where joy unceasing ever dwells with him. Many who heard this Saviour speak believed, Nobly renounced the world, and followed him. From these intrepid followers twelve he chose, Who should be ever with him, mark his ways, And when he left the earth record his words, His actions, and his will, and give to men The richest boon which heaven itself could give. Though many heard his supplicating call, Yet more, indignant, answered him with scoffs: Against him slander vented all its rage, And lavished on his head opprobrious names. His doctrines were opposed to brutal lusts; He nursed the spirit for a heavenly world; He told his followers to be chaste and meek, To look and live above earth's fleeting joys. Such holy dictates were in wrath received By those, who threw on passion's neck the rein. And plung'd unheedful in the depths of vice. Betrayed, derided, by his friends forsaken, This Saviour-God was seized by daring hands, By Jewish rulers was condemned to die, And on the hill of Calvary was raised. And nailed to an accursed cross, and there, In sight of earth and heaven, he bled and died: He gave the spirit which he took on earth Into the arms of God, and closed his work, On which he entered for the sins of men. Nature beheld the awful scene with dread: The God of life expiring on a cross Surpassed conception of Almighty love; The sun grew dim, dark shadows quenched his beam, And Night's thick mantle fell upon the earth; An earthquake shook the globe; the rocks were cleft; The temple's veil was rent in twain; the dead Awoke, arose, and left their darksome graves. Laid in the earth, the tomb did not long hold Him whose dominion over death extends. Christ broke asunder all the bonds of death; He triumphed o'er the grave; he lived again on earth; He called around him his dejected friends; He blessed them and rekindled all their zeal, And darting upwards on the wings of wind, He sought again his own eternal throne, And left them gazing on the passing clouds. Commissioned by the heavenly will of him Who bled and died that rebel man might live, His bold disciples traversed sea and land, Preaching the truths which they had heard of him, And publishing his overtures of peace. No dangers could intimidate these men; They braved the frowns, the pleasures of the world: Love for their God, love for their fellow-men Impelled them on, and thunder-clothed their tongues. Some hardy champions of the cross arrived At Rome; proclaimed aloud the Christian faith, And planted there an early church of Christ. This little band, though peaceable and mild, The foes of strife, and like their master meek, Were not permitted to remain in peace. Loud roared the blasts of persecuting zeal; The heathen raised his unrelenting sword; The Roman tyrant issued his decree, And Christian blood in torrents flowed: but still In Rome religion flourished and increased; The cause of Christ defied the threat of power, The arm of malice, and consuming flames. The Roman empire almost grasps the world, And o'er that world the tyrant Nero reigns. He overtops the pinnacle of vice; Rome never groaned beneath a king so vile. Ah! I have seen him, dark, relentless man, In regal robes, in pomp of pride elate; I marked the scowling of his heavy brow, His eye which bade defiance to his God. The church of Christ beneath his reign had grown, And added to her numbers men of power; The tyrant saw the Christian cause increase, But wilful smothered for a time his rage. At length prepared, and rising in his might, He hurled his dreadful edicts on their heads: He bade the sword of persecution rage Throughout the world, and spare no Christian dog, But butcher in cold blood all sex, all age, and rank, And root the name of Christian from the earth. Nero himself hurled in the domes of Rome Some brands of fire, and while the kindled flames Spread devastation and wild ruin round, Throughout the streets he bade a voice proclaim These flames were lighted by the hands of Christians, Surrounded by the deepening shades of night; Behold, O Romans, what these wretches do! Then raged the fury of ten thousand fiends, And hell's dark angels clapped their wings for joy. The sufferings of the Christians were intense; Yet do I shudder at the deeds I saw, And turn with horror from that dreadful night. A holy bishop had from Carthage come, To cheer the courage of his friends at Rome; His character, his goodness, and his rank, Made him an object of the heathen rage. A burst of voices from the frantic crowds Denounced his death. Around his house Gathered the fierce and raving multitude, Tore from his bed the venerable man, Dragged him exulting through the' affrighted streets, Dashed him against the earth and craggy walls, And threw his mangled members to the flames. A lovely woman, of exalted rank, Who had renounced the idol gods of Rome, With a sweet infant clinging to her breast, With streaming hair, and garments rudely torn, Was dragged by ruffians in the public view, Was brutally insulted, scourged, and gashed; While from her arms her little babe was torn, And, by the pressure of a dungeon villain, Strangled, and stamped beneath the spurning foot. O pardon, sir, these tears, which still will flow: I am a soldier, nor disdain to weep; That holy matron who was thus destroyed Was my fond mother. Yes, I saw her die; I tried to save her, but I strove in vain. I, a late convert to the Christian faith, Escaped the dangers of that hateful night, But was reserved for further scenes of woe. My father still inflexibly remained Attached to heathen principles and rites. Whate'er his will might be, he had no power To shield his wife or son from frantic foes. Finding no safety in his house I fled; I refuge sought in unfrequented ways, In narrow lanes: and at the dead of night Stole like a felon from my lurking-place, In search of friends, who roved unhoused like me. In one lone ramble through the silent streets, A passing soldier marked my hasty steps; He knew me, and commanded me to stop. Alarmed, I strove to disappoint his search; But he rushed on, discovered where I was, And with his sword unsheathed aimed at my life. Forced to oppose his wild impetuous rage, I drew my sword, which in the night I wore, And in the' encounter beat the brutal wretch, Bleeding and howling at my feet: his cry Brought to his aid the nightly guards of Rome. I swiftly fled, and baffled their pursuit. The dying man pronounced my name, and bade His friends remember to revenge his death. Thus noted and proscribed, and like a beast Hunted and followed by the hounds of blood, I could not long escape their eager search. One night, within a large and vaulted cave, I and two hundred Christians more had met To hear explained the scriptures of our God; To bend before his awful throne in prayer; To share the joys of sympathetic hearts. Some happy hours had flown on us engaged In acts of worship and in counsel there, When we were startled by the march of feet, By clashing arms, and voices near our cave. We had not time to fly, before the mouth Of our rude cavern was by soldiers closed, And some fierce bands rushed in with spears and swords, And then commenced the dreadful work of death. The small defence which we could make was vain, And vain our supplications to our foes. The voice of prayer and praise was now exchanged For shrieks of torture, and for dying groans; Late where the broken bread and wine were spread, The emblems of a bleeding Saviour's love, Streamed the warm blood, and fell the mangled limb. Sometime had slaughter rioted and raged, When I, contending in the face of death, In hopes that darkness might afford escape, Flew to the places where the lamps were hung, Dashed them to earth, extinguished all their light. Shrouded in night, and in a cave immured, The Roman soldiers could not now discern Their friends from foes: wild uproar now arose; Confusion fell upon the heathen fiends; They poured down blows upon each other's heads, And in mistake they one another slew: A night more terrible I never saw. I, purposing escape, in silence crept Along the walls, until I reached the door: Then calling to my friends, I bade them seize The present time of flight, and follow me: And springing upwards, o'er the flight of stairs, I gained the street, and saw the moon and stars. Scarce had I time to breathe and look around, When I was seized by the patrolling guards, Was bound with heavy chains, and then was thrown In a deep dungeon, cold, damp as the grave. Excluded there from light or human voice, I lay some weeks, and would have welcomed death; I had but little food, and that was coarse, And such as hunger only would receive. One day I heard my prison doors unbarred, And hailed it as the sound preceding death; But was surprised to see my keeper followed By a patrician magistrate of Rome. He came, he said, to rescue me from woe, To lead me forth to liberty and life, If I would meet compliantly his terms, And render homage to the Gods of Rome. Young man, said he, the emperor is kind, And sends you mercy at your father's prayer. If you renounce the Christian name and faith, Honours await you, you shall roll in wealth, In all the splendours of patrician rank; But if you still to Christians vile adhere, And thus forget your father, birth, and king, Now nearly numbered are your days of life: Hear, then, and weigh the doom, the foul disgrace, Which you will bring upon your wretched head, By persevering in your headlong course: The king designs to give a splendid feast To his victorious soldiers and his friends, And to conclude the pleasures of the day By exhibitions on the stage at night. These royal exhibitions shall consist Of men contending with fierce hungering beasts, Of gladiators skilled in arts of war. Hear, then, and tremble: 'tis great Nero's will That those who meet the lion in his wrath Should be selected from the Christian herd, Those enemies of Rome, and of the Gods: And you, Valerian, if you still refuse To offer incense to the Gods of Rome, Shall, in the view of clamorous multitudes, War with the lion, or the savage boar, And with your dying pangs feast the dark eye Of riot and of joy. Think then, O youth, Before the day of sovereign grace is past; Renounce the errors of a wretched sect, And fill with joy an aged father's heart. I heard his overtures, and thus replied: Bear back my answer to the king you serve, And tell it to the priests and slaves of Rome, That you have seen Valerian in his cell, Of birth as noble as proud Rome can boast, Chained to the cold ground, like the vilest wretch, Buried in filth, in solitude, and night, Pale and worn down, denied the use of food; But that you found him rooted in his faith, Resolved to brave your haughty tyrant's power, And all the pangs his cruelty can form; Resolved to die and feast the heathen wolves, Before he would renounce the truths he holds, Or worship any being but his God. Tell also to the sovereign of the world, That, though I die, I supplicate his favour For those poor Christians whom I leave behind; That he would stay the persecuting sword Which riots in their blood. They never did him harm; Peaceful are they, and, seeking peace of men, They follow in the footsteps of their Lord, And pay to Cæsar what to him is due. All that they claim is liberty to serve Their God and Saviour, as they shall think best. The world holds not a nobler race of men, A race more faithful to the God they own, A race more fervent in their country's cause. Tell to my father that his son forgives His coldness and neglect, and that he dies In prayers for blessings on his reverend head. O tell him that this heart beats high with love For him who gave me birth, and longs to pour Its hopes, its cares, its sorrows in his breast. The Roman magistrate withdrew in wrath. He bade me speedily prepare for death, To sate the hunger of the beast of prey. He bade my keeper give me better food, To nurse my strength against the day of combat, That I might grapple bravely with my foe. My father came, in pity to my wish, To bid his wretched son a last farewell. He wept, he pressed me to his bursting heart, Conjured me by the love I bore to him, By the dear memory of her who died A sainted victim to the cause of Christ, To seek not thus a vile and wretched end, But to renounce the faith I had embraced, And live again in happiness and peace. But all his prayers and all his tears were vain; My resolution nothing could subdue, Rather to meet ten thousand deaths than blast The truths I loved, my fervent hopes of heaven. My father went in anguish from my cell, And I remained more resolute to die. Next day my prison door, on sullen hinge, Was opened by a hasty, forceful hand; I raised my eyes, and saw two Roman guards Enter my cell; within their arms they bore The body of a man, from whose pierced side The dark blood flowed; with rage they dashed him down, And to the cold ground chained his mangled limbs, And then with taunts and haughty stride withdrew. A time insensible the stranger lay, His pains seemed buried in the sleep of death; At length a groan broke from him, and declared That he still lived. Around his cell he cast A sad, exploring eye, and when he saw Me, the companion in his house of woe, He spoke such words as sorrow would employ Toward one united in a common fate. I, answering him, in sympathy enquired By what occurrence he and I were brought, Strangers before, to meet as friends in grief? To which he answered: I, O Roman, am In faith a Christian, and for this I bear The wrongs and insults of a heathen's rage, For this I now am thrust in dungeon depths, And doomed to meet the most opprobrious death. In childhood, led by some advent'rous men, I came to Rome, from distant eastern climes, Whose names, perhaps, have never reached your ear. Here since I lived, here learned the truths of God, For which I'm bound in chains, and doomed to die. Land of my fathers, scenes of infant years! Ye hills and plains, ye streams and tangled woods, O'er which I roved, in boyhood's artless days, O shall Cœlestian never see ye more! Deceiving visions of the night away! Hush not the tumults of the soul to rest, To wake again to keener pangs of woe! Cœlestian ceased. I strove to soothe his cares; I told him mine; I won his honest heart, And in the interchange of voice and thought, With happier speed we winged the hours which passed O'er us immured in solitude and night. Ye sacred pleasures of congenial hearts! This heart can feel, but cannot paint your power: Cheerers of life and of a darkened world, You came to bless my solitary cell! You here have met me on this unknown shore! At length the dreadful night of trial came. Clad in light armour, I by force was dragged From my loathed dungeon, and compelled to meet The hateful shouts of eager gazing crowds. Behold me then upon a public stage, Mocked and insulted, and expecting death. At signal given, with loud and horrid bound, A lion leaps before my view: his eyes Like kindled fires glare frightfully on me; His hairy sides he lashes with his tail; And, couching down, he pours his chilling cry Of hunger and of rage; aroused I start From my sad trance, and in defence I rush Against a foe so terrible and fierce. Soon as he feels the edge of my keen sword His rage redoubles, and his hideous roar Deafens the ear, and shakes the vaulted walls; He waves the terrors of his hoary mane. Collecting all his might, at me he leaps, And with extended claws threatens to tear My quivering members piecemeal on the stage. I start aside and disappoint his rage, And, aided by the gracious arm of Heaven, Ere he recovers from his bound mispent, I plunge my weapon in his panting heart. The mighty savage falls and rolls in blood, He gasps and struggles in the pangs of death. Loud shouts of exultation rend the air, A thousand voices bid the conqueror live. The emperor listens to the general wish: At his command the guards conduct me back To my dark cell, there to remain and wait The will and pleasure of my vengeful foes. I met again Cœlestian, my kind friend, Whose life till now his enemies had spared: He welcomed me as risen from the tomb, And come to haunt his solitude: he scarce Would listen to my tale, or grant belief To my escape from danger and from death. Excuse me, friends, if I should draw the veil O'er the new sufferings of my prison-house. With heavy wing the long and tardy days Passed o'er my dungeon; still I cherished hope: At length arose the dawn of better days, And freedom came to bless my weary eyes. My father's bribe seduced the keeper's heart, And he consented to unlock the doors, And let Cœlestian and myself depart, While slept the guards, and night had hushed the world. Escaped from prison, I and my new friend Resolved to fly for ever from those shores Where liberty of conscience was denied, Where God was worshipped midst the fears of death. Disguised, by night to Ostia's port we came, And meeting there with several Christian friends, Who there had gathered with the same design, A vessel we obtained, in which we all Embarked, and left the walls of haughty Rome, Our fields, our country, and our friends behind, And guided by Cœlestian on our way, We turned our sails toward these far-eastern climes, The most remote from Roman rage and power. Through different countries, many woes we passed, In quest of these auspicious scenes of rest: Through Scylla and Charybdis safe we came, Through the rough Hellespont we ploughed our way, O'er the dark Euxine then with prosperous winds, With hearts made lighter with success, we flew. At length we reached the Caspian ocean's mouth, And hailed with joy its ever-rolling wave. But ah! this transport was too soon o'ercast; A storm arose, the billows beat the skies, The vessel reeled beneath the sweeping blast, The helm refused the guidance of the hand, The sails were split in pieces, and we drove, Left to the fury of the winds and waves. Long we sustained this elemental war, Till on a rock the unrelenting winds The gallant vessel dashed: ah! then arose Loud shrieks which mingled with the thundering storm; The shivered timbers floated on the sea, And o'er the sinking hulk the waters rolled. My noble friends and all the crew were lost; They perished struggling with the flood; me, me Alone the raging billows safely bore, And cast me on these friendly shores of peace. You found me, father, you have brought me here, And, thanks to you and to this generous maid, I live. I feel again the glow of health; I live to bend in gratitude and praise To that high Power who guides the course of worlds, And who in love the sparrow's life sustains. END OF BOOK II. BOOK III. Valerian ended: while his listening friends Hung on his words with interested hearts. Excited by his long adventurous tale, Still they with fond solicitude enquired Concerning Rome, the dangers he escaped, By land, by sea; from beast and cruel man. All which, with grateful heart and willing tongue, The Roman answered with minutest care; And, while he spoke, a tender speaking eye, An eye of soft seraphic blue, was fixed With admiration on his pensive face. Valerian met those brilliant orbs of love: His soul within him felt their potent sway, And gratitude increased the holy flame. Serenely o'er their heads the summer days In wild luxuriance flew: but still the youth Restrained the fervent vow he longed to breathe In the soft ear of his enchanting maid. He marked her manners and her generous heart, Her mind of active and discerning power, And heard delighted her deep-warbling harp; Her simple vestments modestly displayed A matchless form of grace, on which his eye With virtuous and admiring pleasure dwelt. Meantime Alcestes to the aged king His guest Valerian led. The warlike king Received him with a smile and courteous mien; He bade him welcome to his distant shores, And promised him protection and repose. Soon to the chiefs and to the people known, Valerian gained their confidence and love. They praised the stranger and his manners mild; They heard his tale, and listened to those truths Which Christ and his apostles came to teach. Emboldened by his welcome to those shores, And glowing with a zeal to spread abroad The love and glory of his dying Lord, And to diffuse among a savage race The gospel's light, he with discretion broke His great design; gained o'er the kingly mind, Won to his cause the venerable seer, Azora's gentle heart, and him who watched The sacred lamp within the temple's walls. At length prepared, impressed with power divine, Montalvia's race received the faith of Christ, Bowed to that God whose thunder shakes the skies, Who called all being from the womb of night, Who breathed in man the breath and soul of life, Who rolls a thousand wheels, who life sustains, By the sole power of his Almighty arm, And all things governs by his sovereign will. Then, by the radiance of the light of heaven, Infernal darkness from the land was driven; The demon-yell was hushed by Mercy's voice; And idol-temples by the arm divine Were beaten to the ground; the hovering winds Which Superstition spread, to catch the beam Emitted from the skies, were wide dispersed By Heaven's all-conquering storm; and from the shrine Crushed by the thunder's vindicating strength, The trembling priests and impious prophets fled. No more the altars smoked with human blood, Butchered to quench a deathful idol's rage: But prayer and heartfelt praise breathed from the lips, To Him the source and spring of life and joy, To Him who died that rebel man might live, Ascended to the skies, and reached his ear. The Roman saw with joy the work of God Progress and flourish in this heathen land. To Him he bent in fervent grateful prayer, Who sees and governs all concerns of men, Who him had led, o'er seas and through distress, To this asylum from a tyrant's rage. But some there were whose dark malignant minds Beheld with rage their idols hurled to earth, And vented curses on the Christian's head, Who had o'erthrown their superstitious faith. 'Mongst these was Palladon, a wileful priest, Hoary in years and versed in deeds of blood; Beneath the sacred mantle he concealed A cruel, plotting, ever-restless soul, Which laughed at woe, which mocked the tear that flowed. His eye had marked Valerian as his prey. It scowled with vengeance on his noble form, And would have smote him with its horrid gaze. Collecting round him, in a private dome, His friends long tried in villainy and wiles, He thus addressed them with his winning voice:— Happy am I to find, my virtuous friends, That some with me, still faithful to their Gods, Will mourn the honours of their country lost. Who could believe that this strange wandering man, Full of vain babblings, could o'erthrow so soon The long established worship of our land! Our king, grown old, enfeebled in his mind, Implicitly receives his baby tales; Our bald-pate priest, who has become a child, Has also listened to this man of Rome; And thousands following these deluded men, Their fathers' and their country's gods have left. No more we hear the voice of praise ascending To great Oasis; and no more we see On his high altar the fat victim bleed. The multering skies proclaim the damning deeds: And last night spoke a demon of the storm, And said, Avenge, O priest, thy prostrate Gods. O mourn, my friends, at those affrighting woes, Which hang, like dark clouds, o'er this guilty land! Let us, still true to our forefathers' faith, Seek that relief which may from union flow. Say, is there not some way, some righteous path, Which being pursued by us may yet avert The merited impending blow of Heaven? There is, cried one: the Christian youth should die. There spoke, said Palladon, the voice of truth: The Gods themselves would justify the deed, And would reward the bold and faithful arm, Who crushed the foe of Heaven. Let us then, friends, Now take that counsel which will most secure The execution of a deed so just: And ye great Powers who rule the fates of men, Be present with us, give our arms with strength To vindicate successfully your cause. He said: loud acclamations shook the dome, Many contended who should foremost share The danger of the deed. Palladon's voice Hushed the big tumult, and besought his friends, To wait in silence the most favoured time.— Let us all share the danger of the deed; Let us all bear a weapon in our hands, True to our Gods and to our country's rights; And let that steel which chance shall most befriend Drink the heart's blood of Heaven's offending foe.— He said: they all assented to his words, They parted, and their homes in silence sought. Gondalbo's trumpet at the dawn of day Had summoned to the chace his sportful friends: With these came forth a troop of martial dames, Led by Rolinda, first of all in charms. Valerian, curious to explore the wood, Where the magician kept his mystic school, Accoutred in the armour of the land, Mounted a steed, and followed in the train. His stately form, the grace with which he moved, And checked the fury of his headlong horse, Struck his beholders with surprise: but most Rolinda's eye him followed o'er the plains, And most her tongue was lavish in his praise. His courser bounded to the winding horn, And to the clamours of the noisy hounds, That echoed from the hills; he proudly pranced, He snuffed the gale, and waved his floating mane. When they had reached the borders of the wood, Valerian saw with wonder its thick shades, The towering height of its deep-rooted oaks, And felt the chill of their o'ershadowing gloom. Far in the woods the hunters had not plunged, Before the hounds from his rude covert roused A huge and furious boar: his glaring eyes Shone like two stars amidst the depths of night; Like to the murmur of seditious winds, His breath was heard from far; he champed the foam Which dropped down roping from his crooked tusks. He heard the tumult of the coming war, And high upridging his hard bristly back, Prepared to meet the onset of his foes. The dogs that first advanced were gashed and torn, Their fellows fled, the stoutest hunter paused. Swift as the winds Rolinda onward flies, Nor heeds the counsel of her female train: At the fierce beast she boldly hurls her spear; True to her aim, it strikes him in the side, The blood pours down in torrents from the wound. The monster rages with excess of pain, And turns his wrath on her who gave the blow, Loud roaring like the storm. Rolinda's steed Starts back and trembles, while the ponderous boar Against him rushes, throws him to the earth, And with him the fair burden which he held. Helpless Rolinda lies, expecting death: Valerian sees, he hastens to her aid, He throws himself like lightning from his horse, With his long spear he rushes on the boar, And buries it in his extended jaws: He falls, and shakes beneath his weight the ground. Valerian raises the affrighted maid, And gives her back in safety to her friends. The danger past, again the trumpet sounds The signal for the chase, and on they rush, While horn, and clam'rous hound, and joyous shouts, With peal on peal through the deep thickets break, And rouse up silence from her lonely haunts. As thus they wound the tangles of the wood, And beat each thicket, and explored each hill, They heard the loud blast of a bugle horn, And far within the forest shade beheld A youthful warrior leaning on his spear. As they approached they marked his noble form, His dark plume waving to the breath of air, His glittering armour, and his gallant mien, And soon Rolinda in the youth beheld Brave Torismond, the Arimaspian prince, And trembled for the fate of him she loved. The hunter, when he saw the train approach, Started surprised, and sternly grasped his spear: And soon as he and the Montalvian prince Each other knew, rage sparkled in their eyes, And indignation crimsoned o'er their cheeks. Aloud Gondalbo called upon his foe, Upbraided him with taunts, and bade his troop Seize on the wretch, and bind him hand and foot, And bear him to the presence of the king. The prince, indignant, at this insult laughed; Firm in his place he stood, and shook his spear, And towering in his pride of strength thus spoke:— Ha! think'st thou, prince, thou mighty man of war, Thou bold upbraider of a single man, That thou hast caught the lion in thy toils, The lion who has thinned thy crowded ranks And that thou'lt seize him, and him bound expose To the rude gaze of thy detested slaves? I scorn thy threats: here would I stand, alone. And meet the brunt of your united force, But that I have within the sound of horn A band of soldiers, who have hither come With me to share the pleasures of the chase. Then tremble, ruffian, measure back thy steps While now I bid my absent friends approach. He said, and loudly blew his bugle horn, Which far extended its indignant blast. The warning sound his friends obedient heard, And swiftly at his call through thickets dashed, And gathered round their loved and warlike chief, Then had the storm of bloody battle raged, But that young Torismond his soldiers checked, And thus accosted the Montalvian prince: Ho! man of words, now execute thy threat; Now bind me fast, and bear me to your king: Sooner by far you might arrest the winds, And yoke the lightnings to your battle-car. But why for us should these bold warriors bleed? Why in a private quarrel should we waste The lives of friends so faithful in our cause? Come on then, chief, alone, and leave thy horse, And meet the prowess of this single arm; And let our bands look on and mark our feats, And say who most excels in deeds of arms. He said: Gondalbo bounded from his horse; He bade his soldiers pause, nor raise a hand Or weapon in the fight. Silence ensued; The combatants drew near; aside they threw Their spears; they seized their swords, together rushed, And shook the earth beneath their mighty strides; Swift fell the blows of their loud thundering steel, And far and wide their din of battle spread At times Gondalbo seemed to press his foe With conquering force; at times he seemed to yield Beneath his rival's power; and both at times Seemed weary of the fight and dreadful toil. Long they contended, and the turf beneath With foot they hardened, and with blood they dyed; Yet still in doubtful scales the vict'ry hung. At length Gondalbo, with a wary eye. Believed he saw his rival's power decline, And thought one mighty effort would secure To him the triumph of the bloody strife. Rouzing his strength, and raising high his sword, He struck the head of his relentless foe; While at the moment he himself received, Deep in the side, the plunge of his keen sword: Both fell, and rolled in anguish on the ground. Loud shrieked Rolinda, and within the arms Of her attendants sunk: her lover's name Burst from her lips, and told the tender flame She nursed with secret sorrow in her heart. When the troops saw their princely leaders fall They to their aid with eagerness rushed on: Each man believed his fallen chief was dead, And breathed revenge upon his hated foes. Dark was the battle which with fury raged Between these adverse bands: they were two clouds Charged with dread thunder that together met; They were two torrents meeting on a hill, And upward dashing in the air their spray. Valerian's noble soul was sick of wars; He mourned for men contending like the beasts, With cruel joy, and rioting in blood: But now in self defence he drew his sword, And with an arm unrivalled in its strength, Beat from him the assaults and rage of war. The fight was won by bold Montalvia's sons; Through the wild shades the Arimaspians fled, And left their leader bleeding on the earth. Valerian checked his friends in the pursuit, And bade them both the fallen princes raise, And to the city gently bear them back. Rolinda followed in the mournful train, With eye dejected and with altered air; Her long dishevelled hair waved in the wind, And frequent sighs broke from her aching heart. Valerian, with a few who yet remained, Through the wide forest still explored his way, Till the high turrets of a ruined fane Rose to his view, embosomed in the woods: Along its side a torrent dashed its foam, And a bleak hill o'erlooked its massy walls. Here the magician lived, and, nursed in wiles, Deluded men by tales of future life. Arrived, they sought admission at the door, And heard their blows roll through the mouldering hall. A hand within drew back the iron bars, And a deep voice cried, Mortals, follow me; O ye who come with just desire to learn The secrets of my dark mysterious art, To hear me tell the hidden scenes of time, Come follow me, and I will lead you where The world shut out shall not obtrude, or break The spell of magic which I breathe around. The hearts of some were fear-struck by his words, But still Valerian led the way to know How would this scene of dark deception end. They trod with caution up a flight of stairs, And moved along a floor with echoing steps, Which winding led them to an iron door: Here the magician paused, and with a key Unlocked the door, which turned on sullen hinge, And showed the hall of magical deceit. He bade them enter, nor a whisper breathe. He then with slow and measured step withdrew, And suddenly appeared, waving a rod, And clothed in vestments of the deepest black Valerian marked his venerable form, His eye of piercing and bewildering glance, His beard and hair, white with the snows of age, The hoarse and hollow cadence of his voice. The windows of this circling hall were closed, And two dim lights, suspended from the walls, Threw o'er the darkness a deceitful ray; Silence prevailed, and superstitious dread Pressed with cold hand the unenlightened heart. And now the wizard spoke: Tread not, my friends, Beyond that line of black which marks the floor; And, for the world's vast treasures, O speak not When my kind spirit answers to my call. Now fearless speak, O mortal, and declare What thou would'st know of me: My art extends Far in the depths of dark unmeasured time. A voice then spoke: Mysterious being, tell What means this vision, or this warning dream. Some years ago my warlike father fell. Struck by assassin hands, within these shades; 'Twas three nights since, at wizard-hour of one, When the pale moon-beam over nature hung, And the red planet trembled in the sky, Methought I saw my father in my room, Bending on me a stern enquiring eye; He thrice traversed with martial step the floor, Which doleful echoed as he moved along; Inverted in his hand he held his spear, And his tall plumes waved awful o'er his brows. Slowly approaching my bed-side he placed His hand upon his bleeding breast, and said, My son, avenge your father's wrongs; I fell By villain-wiles within the forest shades. He spoke no more, but vanished from my sight, Just as I broke the frightful dream, and rose To clasp him in my arms. Tell thou to me What means this dream, this vision of the night. Then ceased the voice. The stern magician seemed As if deep-struck by agonies of guilt: Nature was acting in the place of art. His features were distorted and convulsed, His dark eye-balls seemed bursting from his head, And frenzy seemed to agitate his frame. At length, collecting all his firmness, he Prepared to act his diabolic part. He drew a phial from his robe, and poured A liquid which it held upon the floor. A flame arose with undulating spires, And with a blue light overspread the room; A cloud of smoke proceeded from the flame, And rising to the ceiling, there assumed A form which bore resemblance to a man. At length a voice of deep and hollow tone Burst on the ear from that collected cloud, And answered thus to the inquiring man:— Why hast thou, mortal, called me from my place? Why didst thou say, Perturbed spirit, come? Yet, powerful man, obedient to thy voice, I here am wafted on the clouds of woe: Then hear me speak, and bid my spirit rest. The dream spoke truth: within this forest fell Thy father, youth; a dagger pierced his heart; Yet walks the earth, and breathes the air of life, The man who slew him at the dead of night; Yet shall the son avenge his father's wrongs.— Silence ensued; the mystic flame expired; The aged wizard toward the window sprang And let the day-light enter through the hall: Big drops hung coldly on his pallid face, And he looked wildly as if woke from death. In fear and wonder the Montalvians stood, And more than iron fetters bound their tongues. Valerian, bending a stern piercing eye On the magician, thus the silence broke:— Old man, I've marked attentively thine art, And for thy peace, and for the peace of men, I warn thee, follow thy deceits no more. Well hast thou studied and practised thy wiles, But art in thee could not conceal thy guilt; Say, know'st thou not more of the man who fell, Stabbed by assassin, than thou gav'st a tongue I pity thee; but mark me, magic-man, Renounce thy 'snaring wiles, or fear my power. A chemic potion, which thy phial held, Produced the flame and smoke which filled the room; Thou art possessed of ventriloquial powers, Which made thy voice seem bursting from the cloud. Awed and o'erpowered by these imposing arts, Men are deluded by thy cunning tales, And honour thee as something more than man.— He ceased: he hastily withdrew, and left The man of magic, trembling at his words. Through the deep woods he measured back his steps, And having reached again the open plains, Dismissed in courteous terms his friendly guides, And then pursued his solitary way. Night fell around him as he bent his course, Seeking the cottage of his gentle friend. No moon arose to light him in his path; The stars were hid by wrathful flying clouds; Shrill blasts swept o'er him, and big drops of rain Beat loudly on the earth; the lightning's flash Disclosed the terror of the gathering storm, And muttering thunders shook the vault of heaven. Valerian, still a stranger in the land, Deprived of light, and parted from his friends, With speed urged onward his affrighted steed, Uncertain of the road. He had some hours Thus held his devious course, when, by the glare Emitted from the clouds, his startled eye Caught a huge figure moving at his side. Scarce had his voice denoted his surprise, When a strong hand impelled him from his horse. With sudden bound he broke the vigorous grasp, Unsheathed his sword, and, with a fearless heart, On his assailant rushed; he struck the steel Which his mysterious foe plunged at his heart. Then in the dark a deadly battle raged; Blow answered blow, and from the neighbouring hills Their noise of battle rung. Not long they fought, Before shrill whistles sounded through the gloom, Approaching steps were heard to beat the earth, And hosts of foes came to the aid of him Who felt the thunder of Valerian's arm A voice then spoke: Ho, comrades, seize this man! And harm him not, but bear him to my cave. Resistance proved in vain; by numbers pressed, Valerian now was seized, his arms were bound, And he was dragged to Artaban's rude cave. Awhile he lay in darkness, and in doubt What fate impended o'er his weary head: On his suspense the light of torches beamed, And in the cavern throngs of robbers came, Clad in dark armour, and begrimed with dust. Above the rest Artaban towered in bulk, In form more beautiful, in brighter arms; The helmet which he wore, with streaming hair, Concealed a face of strong, determined lines. Breaking the awful stillness of the night, In voice commanding thus he spoke: Brave men, Unbind the captive's hands. Say, gallant foe, Dost thou know Artaban, who roams these wilds? Hast thou not heard of him? If thou hast not, Thou art a stranger here. I, I am he; I crush the head of overtopping pride, And take from wealth its overflowing stores. A robber I am called; the mother clasps Her babe more closely to her anxious breast At mention of my name: her or her babe, Or sorrow's worn-down man I never harmed: I know of men who roll in regal power, Who merit more the robber's name than I. Say, stranger, who art thou? Tell without fear; Since I was born I never coped with man Who wielded with a braver force his sword. Fearless, Valerian answered his desire, Told who he was, his hasty flight from Rome, And his arrival on those distant shores. Which when he heard, the robber seized his hand And in impetuous accents thus replied:— Art thou a Roman? See a Roman here! Behold my face uncovered to thy gaze, And mark the eagle-feature which it wears. I also fled from Rome, ungrateful Rome: This bosom, rough with honourable scars, Can tell how faithful I have been to her, But gratitude made no return to me. I left, indignant, her detested shores, And here have lived on plunder and on war. With my whole heart I honour thee, brave man; Be henceforth free as air; Artaban's band Shall never do thee harm; I am thy friend, And in thy time of danger call on me. I now will guide thee safely to thy home, Through all the windings of these darksome haunts. He said; and answering to his words, drew forth Valerian from his cave, and over hill, And over bosky dell, through winds and rains, And through the starless night, him faithful led, And left in safety at Alcestes' cot. This good performed, these strange adventures past, Valerian with his venerable friend Dwelt for a time securely in repose: The pomp of Rome, her halls and ivory domes, Gave not that peace, which blessed the cot That humbly rose upon the Caspian shore. Nor was the youth forgetful of his love; His heart's fond treasure was Azora still: A mind so kind and good, a form so fair, Dwelt in his thoughts, and soothed his nightly dream. She was his pupil, and, with tenderest care, He taught “his lovely scholar all he knew;” Explained to her the Scriptures of his God, And all the wonders of the Roman world. From his instructions she in knowledge grew, Her soul expanded with the love of truth, Her eye was lighted by the torch of heaven, And all her love she centered on her friend. One night Valerian rambled o'er the plains, And, guided by the pale torch of the moon, Thoughtful indulged the golden dreams of love: Clear was the sky, no night-cloud crossed the stars, The spicy zephyr poured his murmuring song, And on the rocks the heaving billows died. Enchanted with this scene of night, and wrapt In melancholy guise, he rambled on, And bent his museful steps to a wild hill, Whose top was shaded by a knot of trees, Whose foot was bathed by a romantic stream, Which poured its mellow cadence on the ear, And in the tangled thickets lost its way. Before he reached the hill, his ear was struck By the sweet clamours of Azora's harp, And by this ditty warbled to the winds: Clothe me, still night, within thy mantle grey, Nor mark the blush that crimsons o'er my cheek, Bear not my accents, rustling wind, away, O let no mortal hear me while I speak. To thee, soft moonlight, I address my tale, Ye stars of heaven, to you I lift mine eyes, With tears I bathe the pinions of the gale, And load these shadows with my heavy sighs. Come, harp, thy strings of harmony awake, Come lull thy mistress with one soothing strain, This magic sorrow of her bosom break, Loud let thy transports drown the voice of pain. Azora loves; her bosom feels a flame, A passion pure, most sacred, and most true; Why should I falsely blush to tell his name? Brave youth of Rome, my bosom beats for you. Thy lofty soul, thy martial form of grace, Thy heart all noble, free from treacherous art, Thy winning manners, and thy pensive face, Have won Azora's unassuming heart. O had I still this heart to give again, Brave youth of Rome, I'd give it to thee still; O could I banish from this heart its pain, Its dissolution would oppose my will. But low and humble is Azora's lot; Born in obscurity, a heathen maid, My days have flown in yonder little cot, My rambling foot has never left this shade. But thou, dear youth, didst come to cheer this clime, To pour instruction on this darkened mind, To teach this soul to pass the bounds of time, To soar to heaven, and leave the world behind. O were I mistress of the proud world's throne, And thou a suppliant on thy bended knee. Thee, dear Valerian, would I love alone, No passion would I cherish but for thee. Say then, brave stranger, can thy heart receive A heart in which thy virtues ever dwell? These shades, these streamlets, canst thou ever leave, And bid Azora and her cot farewell? Oh, if thou canst, dear wandering youth, adieu, I'll write thy image and thy memory here, And at still evening, while I think of you, I'll seek thy safety with a prayerful tear. Cease now, my harp, fall silence on thy strings, Dews of the night, descend upon my breast, Breeze, fan my loose locks with thy unfelt wings, And rock me, angels, in the arms of rest. Azora ceased; and on the passing winds The murmur of her music died away. Wrapt in big transports stood the listening youth; Dreams from Elysium for a moment bound In fetters magical his limbs and tongue: At length he broke his joy's enchanting spell, And with a voice of full and mellow tones, Thus answered to the night song of the maid: Where roves my sad romantic maid, Kind shepherds can you tell? Say, have you seen her in the shade, The hill, or tangled dell? Tell me, sweet stream, that babblest by, Hast thou not listened to her sigh? Sad echo, from thy mossy hall, Didst thou the wanderer see; And didst thou answer to her call, And did she speak of me? Soft gales of evening, bathed in dew, Oh! have you seen her as you flew? I seek her over hill and dale, O'er stream, through whispering grove, I tell her name to every gale, Breathed from the heart of love; I call—but still no voice replies; I call—but still Azora flits. The robe she wears, of azure hue, Floats loosely on the air; Her eyes are of seraphic blue, Pale brown her waving hair; Her steps are like the bounding roe, Her cheeks the rose, her forehead snow. The nightingale would cease to sing, To listen to her lay, And zephyr spread its silken wing, To bear the notes away: Her voice, her air, her face impart A mind, a genius, and a heart. Behold, the sun withdraws his beam, And darkness shrouds the scene; The night-bird pours his hollow scream, The night-wind sweeps the green; No pipe is heard on mead or rock, The shepherd homeward drives his flock: O then return, my peerless fair, Restrain thy eager flight; The falling dews will drench thine hair, Unwholesome is the night. I'll wind each thicket, beat each shade, Till I have found thee, wandering maid. Thus sang the youth; and lightly o'er the stream, And up the hill with bounding step he flew. He found Azora leaning on her harp; His faithful vows he proffered at her feet, And he received a heart already his. Chaste Dian smiled upon their virtuous love, And silvered o'er the shadow of the night. Valerian led her to her father's cot; They offered up their mutual vows to God; The happy father blessed the faithful pair, And Heaven's rich blessings crowned their days and years. By Oriander and the nation loved, Valerian grew in influence and power; The truths divine he taught more widely spread, And future years, he hoped, would bless the hand Which, in the land of darkness and of death, Had sown the seeds of everlasting life. How far were answered these auspicious hopes, The scenes and changes which by years were brought On those fair climes which owned the eastern sun; The deeds of war, and garments rolled in blood, Conspiracy, with all its dark designs, With milder scenes of love and quiet life, If Heaven permit, my verse may yet unfold.</field>
